      <h1>Conor McGregor vs Donald Cerrone could be announced tonight at UFC 244</h1>
      <h2>McGregor is set to return to the UFC in the new year having not fought since last October</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T14:46:21+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 14:46</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Conor McGregor's coach believes the star's fight against Donald Cerrone could be announced tonight.</p>
      <p>The Irishman has not fought since he was choked out by Khabib Nurmagomedov in their lightweight title fight last October.</p>
      <p>But he is ready to end his self-imposed exile on January 18 with Cerrone set to be confirmed as his opponent.</p>
      <p>And McGregor's long-time trainer John Kavanagh speculated that the bout could be announced during UFC 244.</p>

      <p>And Kavanagh told ESPN: "Like (UFC president) Dana [White] said nothing is 100 per cent until all contracts are signed. I do, as far as I am aware all parties have agreed more or less in principle.</p>
      <p>"There may be a few kinks to be ironed out. But, as far as I am aware, hopefully, an announcement is imminent.</p>
      <p>"I'm just happy to see him back competing and is in a great mindset. We are training away, chipping away.</p>
      <p>"It is 11 weeks tomorrow and ticking all the boxes. I can't wait for the announcement so we can be full steam ahead.</p>
      <p>"But, I am sure it is, I actually had in my head maybe during this event [UFC 244] they are going to do an ad or something, I donâ€™t know, maybe that is coming."</p>
      <p>McGregor announced his comeback at a press conference in Moscow last week and said he plans to fight three times in 2020.</p>
      <p>He said: "I would like to announce to the public, the return of the 'Notorious' <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> will take place on January 18 in the T Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. So that is my comeback fight.</p>

      <p>"It is 12 weeks this Saturday, I'm in prime physical condition.</p>
      <p>"Ask the UFC who my opponent is because I do not give a f*** who the opponent is."</p>
      <p>"That will be the beginning of my season. I will then look to compete against the winner of Nate Diaz-Jorge Masvidal.</p>
      <p>"Obviously I have history with Nate Diaz, we are set to make the trilogy bout. We will see how it goes. I feel Nate will get the better of that one.</p>
      <p>"Then I will seek the Moscow bout and it will be against the winner of Tony Ferguson and Khabib Nurmagomedov.</p>
      <p>"We want this bout in Moscow. The people in Russia deserve this bout to take place. The people of the world deserve this bout to take place.</p>
      <p>"There is an inevitable rematch, it is a rematch that I will come in sharp, fresh. I will have no injuries, I will have no alcohol, I will have no outside influences, I will be fully focused, exactly what the people deserve. And we will settle it once and for all."</p>
