      <h1>Police probing Vote Leave Brexit campaign 'spending breaches' pass file to prosecutors</h1>
      <h2>Vote Leave - which was backed by Boris Johnson - has already been fined £61,000 for breaking electoral law</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T14:33:55+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 14:33</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Police have sent a file to prosecutors concerning allegations against the official campaign for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a>.</p>
      <p>Scotland Yard has sought ‘early investigative advice’ from the Crown Prosecution Service over claims about Vote Leave’s spending in the run-up to the 2016 referendum.</p>
      <p>The Electoral Commission referred the matter to police in July 2018 when it fined Vote Leave £61,000 for breaking electoral law.</p>
      <p>At the time, the Commission indicated police would look at “whether any persons have committed related offences which lie outside the Commission’s regulatory remit.”</p>
      <p>The Met Police have now confirmed that they sent a file for “early investigative advice” to the CPS on October 17.</p>
      <p>The move was first reported by the OpenDemocracy website.</p>
      <p>Vote Leave was backed by high profile MPs including <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> and his senior aide Dominic Cummings was its campaign director.</p>
      <p>Police and prosecutors have not arrested or charged anyone with a criminal offence, and senior figures from Vote Leave strongly deny criminal wrongdoing.</p>

      <p>Seeking early investigative advice is a standard procedure for “serious, sensitive or complex” cases, according to guidance from the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
      <p>It can also be used in “any case where a police supervisor considers it would be of assistance in helping to determine the evidence that will be required to support a prosecution or to decide if a case can proceed to court.”</p>
      <p>A Scotland Yard spokesman said: “On Thursday, 17 October 2019 the MPS submitted a file to the CPS for Early Investigative Advice in relation to the second investigation, which followed a referral from the Electoral Commission on 17 July 2018 and concerns Vote Leave and BeLeave.”</p>
      <p>In its investigation last year, the Commission slammed Vote Leave's decision to hand more than £600,000 to a then 23-year-old fashion student - which his group BeLeave spent on a data analytics and voter targeting firm.</p>
      <p>The donation to Darren Grimes, days before the 2016 referendum, meant Vote Leave did not breach its £7million spending limit.</p>

      <p>But in its original report the Commission said there was "significant evidence of joint working" between Mr Grimes and Vote Leave. </p>
      <p>That meant Vote Leave should have declared the spending as its own, the watchdog said.</p>
      <p>However, Mr Grimes later won an appeal overturning a separate £20,000 fine imposed on him personally by the Commission.</p>
      <p>Mr Grimes said he was registered as an individual due to an “incorrectly ticked box on an application form” and said in July: “I am delighted and relieved that the court has found me innocent.”</p>
      <p>The separate Leave.EU campaign had also previously faced a criminal probe but police dropped it with no charges being brought.</p>
      <p>Senior Vote Leave figures did not comment when contacted by the Mirror.</p>
