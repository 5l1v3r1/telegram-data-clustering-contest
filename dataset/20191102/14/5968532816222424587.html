      <p>The Apple AirPods Pro is significantly better than the previous AirPods iterations and costs just $50 more than the AirPods (2019) with a wireless charging case. Sound quality has improved, thanks to complete redesign and nozzles that actually seal to the ear. Apple also made the AirPods Pro sweat-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about water damage. If you have an iPhone, these are the earbuds to get.</p>
      <p>New AirPods rumors have run circles around us, but the new <a href="http://tyvm.ly/o0S4wa7">Apple AirPods Pro</a> have finally made it to physical and virtual shelves alike. Apple heavily upgraded the AirPods Pro, turning them into true wireless earbuds we readily recommend. Not only do these properly seal to the ear now, but they also boast premium features like noise canceling and an IPX4 water-resistant build. The only thing likely to hold you back from getting a pair is the $250 price.</p>
      <h3>Who should buy the Apple AirPods Pro?</h3>

        <figcaption>The earbuds fit snug in the ear canal now, thanks to dedicated nozzles.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Apple iPhone owners, or anyone with an iOS device for that matter, will get the best bang-for-your-buck from the AirPods Pro. This is the best true wireless option for iPhones due to the integrated <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-h1-979713/">H1 chip,</a> which facilitates greater power efficiency and other neat tricks like hands-free Siri access.</li>
        <li>True wireless fans will enjoy the new AirPods Pro because active noise canceling is difficult to find in this type of wireless earphone, save for the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-beats-powerbeats-pro-review-988805/">Beats</a>, <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/sony-wf-1000xm3-review-25342/">Sony</a>, or <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-freebuds-3-review-1048427/">Huawei</a> earbuds.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-true-wireless-workout-earbuds-963925/">Athletes</a> and gym-goers should consider the AirPods Pro for their <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/decoding-ip-ratings-16550/">IPX4</a> sweat-resistant build and new design which provides a more secure fit than old models.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What are the AirPods Pro like?</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple-AirPods-Pro-earbuds-iPhone-hand-1200x675.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>The AirPods Pro earbuds are shorter than the original and feature a vent on each bud to minimize ear pressure.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Apple AirPods Pro received a drastic facelift. Now, nozzles let the earbuds <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/how-your-in-ears-fit-matters-a-lot-21686/">seal the ear canal</a>, which improves sound quality and noise-canceling performance. Apple clearly put a lot of thought into its ear tip design: these silicone tips perfectly fit the AirPods Pro. Rather than fitting around a nozzle that transitions into the housing, there’s a divot that the silicone collar clicks into, making it resistant to detachment.</p>
      <blockquote>Android users aren't afforded H1 chip benefits but can still use transparency mode.</blockquote>
      <p>Don’t fret if you’re unsure of how to <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/finding-ear-tips-17148/">find the best fit</a>: the AirPods Pro can test this directly from your iPhone, which <i>SoundGuys</i> explains in its <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/apple-airpods-pro-review-27106/">full Apple AirPods Pro review</a>. Once you find the best set for you, the noise-canceling AirPods Pro automatically pair with your <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/best-iphone-earbuds-19070/">iPhone</a> by way of an on-screen pop-up. Android users, we still have to dig through our Bluetooth menus, as our platform isn’t afforded the same streamlined experience as H1 chip-compatible iPhones.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple-AirPods-Pro-earbuds-stem-hand-1200x644.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>An indentation on each stem indicates where you can press to control playback and switch between listening modes.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Just like the original AirPods and <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/apple-airpods-review-11072/">AirPods (2019)</a>, the new Apple AirPods Pro sport a stemmed design, but this time with a functional twist. Squeezing an indentation on either stem lets you control music playback. There are other useful features that aren’t available from your run-of-the-mill true wireless earbuds, like transparency mode. This allows external noise in through the earbuds, so you can clearly hear your subway line’s stop or respond to a train ticketer. It’s also good for remaining aware of your surroundings when <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/running-headphones-guide-19668/">running</a> outside. To toggle transparency mode, press and hold the stem for a few seconds.</p>
      <p>Like other <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-beats-powerbeats-pro-review-988805/">Apple-manufactured products</a>, these wireless earbuds are decked out with sensors to make the user experience absolutely seamless. Dual optical and motion-detecting sensors facilitate auto-pause and play detection when removing an earbud (iOS only). Force sensors in the stems let listeners control their music and take calls by pressing, multi-pressing, or holding the stem.</p>
      <h3>Battery life is better than before</h3>
      <p><i>SoundGuys</i> recorded 5 hours, 6 minutes of constant playback with noise-canceling turned on while connected to an iOS device. This is above average for <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-true-wireless-earbuds-877657/">true wireless earbuds</a> and better than Apple’s specified 4.5-hour battery life (ANC on). With the Lightning case fully charged, you can enjoy up to 24 hours of playtime before topping up. Just five minutes in the charging case provides one hour of listening with the AirPods Pro. This time around, Apple enabled <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/wireless-charging-qi-pad-technology-580015/">Qi wireless charging</a> by default rather than forcing listeners to cough up more money for something <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-review-22454/">Samsung</a> includes for much less.</p>
      <h3>How to connect the Apple AirPods Pro to an Android phone</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple-AirPods-Pro-iphone-noise-cancelling-transparent-audio-1200x675.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>You can alternate listening modes directly from an iPhone.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>While connecting to an iOS 13.2 device is a breeze, there are a few hoops Android users need to jump through before using the AirPods Pro. If you’ve used previous AirPods models, then you’re familiar with holding the button on the back of the charging case to enter Bluetooth pairing mode. After you’ve done that, dig into your smartphone’s Bluetooth settings and scan for new devices; wait until the AirPods Pro appear as an available device. Select the AirPods Pro, and the two devices will connect.</p>
      <p>As an Android user, you’re not granted the same privileges as iPhone users. For one, auto-pause when removing one earbud doesn’t work and, of course, hands-free Siri access is unavailable. That said, the important features like noise-canceling and transparency mode work well by pressing and holding the stems.</p>
      <h3>Is the noise-canceling good?</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple-AirPods-Pro-Isolation-1024x675.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Apple has significantly improved the fit of the AirPods Pro over the originals, and when you pair that isolation with the built-in ANC you get pretty good noise-canceling throughout the range.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Yes, the Apple AirPods Pro noise-canceling is effective largely due to the revamped fit. In the <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/how-to-read-charts-23129/">chart</a> above, the higher up the line, the more a certain frequency is blocked out. This means the 100-500Hz frequency range isn’t as attenuated compared to high frequencies (4kHz and greater). Inward and outward-facing microphones facilitate noise-canceling via <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/how-do-noise-cancelling-headphones-work-12380/">destructive interference</a>. They aren’t the best <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/best-noise-cancelling-earbuds-5897">noise-canceling earbuds</a> available or even the best noise-canceling true wireless earbuds — for that, you need the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/sony-wf-1000xm3-review-1016723/">Sony WF-1000XM3</a> — but the improvement is dramatic compared to the original AirPods and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-airpods-2019-review-988530/">AirPods 2</a>.</p>
      <h3>How do Apple AirPods Pro sound?</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple-AirPods-Pro-Frequency-Response1-1028x675.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>The AirPods Pro only give significant emphasis to some of the highs above 1100Hz, with most of the low end appearing close to 0dB save for a dip in the sub-50Hz range.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>As many audio enthusiasts and reviewers will tell you, audio can be objectively measured, but subjective preferences matter just as well. In order to make the listening experience as uniform as possible, the AirPods Pro intelligently equalize music playback based on the shape of each listener’s ears. This combined with effective passive and active noise attenuation makes these sound markedly better than their forerunners.</p>
      <p>While bass notes receive some emphasis, certainly more than the previous AirPods, it’s not as emphatic as what can be heard with the Beats Powerbeats Pro. Midrange <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/frequency-response-explained-16507">frequencies</a> (e.g. vocals) sound slightly quieter than bass frequencies. Treble notes, on the other hand, are the most exaggerated and sound twice as loud as the mids. This sound signature bodes well for pop and hip-hop, because you experience some low-end oomph and perceive even more detail from resonant, high-pitched sounds. It’s a generally <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/studio-headphones-why-you-dont-want-the...">consumer-friendly</a> sound that pleases a large swath of listeners.</p>
      <h4>The microphone is great</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple-AirPods-Pro-FR-Chart-voice-1028x675.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>The Apple AirPods Pro have a fairly neutral frequency response which will make all parts of your voice come across equally loud when talking on the phone.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>AirPods have taken over as a primary method for taking hands-free calls. Just like the previous AirPods, the AirPods Pro have a solid microphone array for transmitting the human voice. Voices are relayed with minimal deviation across the vocal spectrum, which means your low-pitched voice and your friend’s high-pitched voice should both sound accurate when relayed with the AirPods Pro. You will hear some variation in vocal reproduction though as the mics can’t replicate a completely neutral response, but it should be fine for personal and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/why-conference-calls-sound-bad-and-what-you-can-do-about-it-1010669/">business calls</a> nonetheless.</p>
      <h3>How do the Apple AirPods Pro compare to the AirPods, other true wireless earbuds?</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Apple-new-AirPods-2_earbuds-case-separate-840x473.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>The AirPods (2019) are identical to the original AirPods but feature internal changes like the H1 chip.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Apple remedies the most offensive design flaw of the first two AirPods models with the AirPods Pro: an <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/what-is-isolation-12506">unsealed</a> ear canal. It may seem like audio enthusiasts are endlessly harping on the California-based company, but this design upgrade directly improves audio quality and fit. Getting a proper seal and rid of external noise is important because it prevents <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/frequency-response-understanding-sounds-24156/">auditory masking</a>, which is when loud noises (e.g. an air conditioner) make it difficult to hear quieter noises (e.g. the music coming from your AirPods).</p>
      <blockquote>If you’re debating between the older AirPods and AirPods Pro, get the AirPods Pro.</blockquote>
      <p>Our brains only have so much bandwidth to perceive and analyze sound. This was essential for survival back in the Paleolithic Era when recognizing the sound of an incoming predator took precedence over your pal’s monosyllabic grunts. Today, however, we’re far less likely to be chased down by a lion, thus this auditory hierarchy isn’t as necessary. The AirPods Pro’s seal lessens the amount of information our brains need to process, making it easier to hear detail in our favorite tunes.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sony_WF1000XM3-5_earbuds-hand-Nikon-camera-watch-1200x675.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>The Sony WF-1000XM3 doesn’t offer any sweat-resistance, but ANC is much more effective.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Now, if you’re considering other noise-canceling true wireless earbuds, that’s a different story. The <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/sony-wf-1000xm3-review-25342/">Sony WF-1000XM3</a> outperforms the AirPods Pro’s noise-canceling capabilities. This comes at the expense of battery life which is a bit shorter: you get 4.76 hours of playback compared to Apple’s 5.11 hours of playback. Another great option, be it an on-ear one, is the <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/beats-solo-pro-review-26938/">Beats Solo Pro</a>. Battery life is significantly better (21.88 hours) and you’re afforded similar up-to-date tech like the H1 chip and Bluetooth 5.0 firmware. Of course, the <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/apple-airpods-vs-powerbeats-pro-23956/">Beats Powerbeats Pro</a> earbuds are a great pick but don’t provide any ANC.</p>
      <h3>Should you buy the Apple AirPods Pro?</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>The proprietary silicone ear tips are a fabulous touch addition to the AirPods Pro and prevent them from separating from the housings.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>If you’ve been thinking about getting a pair of AirPods or happen to be an iPhone user, the <a href="http://tyvm.ly/o0S4wa7">Apple AirPods Pro</a> are the only AirPods we recommend with gusto. Not only do the wireless earpods sound notably better than their predecessors, but they support more features. Yes, they’re $50 more than the AirPods 2019 with a wireless charging case, but you get a lot for those extra $50. Chances are high that if you’re an <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/best-airpods-alternatives-20825/">iPhone</a> user, you’ve already committed to staying within the Apple ecosystem, which makes sense: Apple makes it easy to join and hard to leave the Cupertino family. For those who plan to remain within the Apple family, these are the Bluetooth earbuds to invest in.</p>
