      <p>A Tennessee convenience store employee who gunned down a fleeing Black teen accused of stealing a $2 can of beer was sentenced to 22 years in prison on Thursday, authorities said.</p>
      <p><b>Anwar Ghazali</b>, a clerk at the Top Stop Shop in North Memphis, was found guilty of second-degree murder in the killing of 17-year-of <b>Dorian Harri</b><b>s </b>last March. A <a href="https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/2019/08/15/memphis-store-clerk-guilty-murder-teen-who-stole-2-dollar-drink-anwar-ghanzali-dorian-harris-trial/2017797001/">jury convicted him</a> in the crime in August.</p>

      <p>The shooting unfolded just after 10 p.m. on March 29 when Harris stopped in the store. Surveillance footage shows the teen walking inside and heading straight for a cooler, where he grabs a beer. Harris is seen leaving just seconds later.</p>
      <p>In the video, an armed Ghazali, 30, is seen trailing the teen as he leaves the store. A pursuit ensued and ended with the store clerk firing several shots, one of which severed Harris’ femoral artery, causing him to bleed out.</p>
      <p>The young man’s body was found behind an abandoned home two days later.</p>
      <p>“The defendant took it upon himself to be the judge, the jury and the executioner over a $2 [drink]. That’s why we’re here,” state prosecutor Lora Fowler said at  Ghazali’s trial earlier this year. “Why are you using deadly force to defend a [drink]?”</p>
      <p>Authorities said the clerk returned to the store without calling police or emergency services.</p>
      <p>Harris’ death triggered days of protests that shuttered the Top Stop Shop for two weeks.</p>
