      <h1>Motherwell chief breaks Stephen Robinson silence and concedes he can't rule out Hearts switch</h1>
      <h2>There's a vacancy at Tynecastle after Craig Levein's departure this week.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T14:56:06+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 14:56</time> by <a rel="author">Gabriel McKay</a></address>
      <p>Motherwell chief executive Alan Burrows says there's been no approach from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> for manager Stephen Robinson - but can't rule out his departure.</p>
      <p>The Tynecastle club sacked <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Craig Levein</a> earlier this week, though he'll remain on the board until the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Robinson was immediately identified as one of the favourites to replace him, and the Steelmen's chief executive didn't rule out the manager leaving.</p>
      <p>Speaking on <i><b>BBC Radio Scotland</b> </i>Burrows said: "Nobody's been in touch, there's been no contact by anybody, informal or formal.</p>

      <p>"The nature of a club like <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a> is that when people, players, managers, do well then other people take interest.</p>
      <p>"That's the nature of the beast and that's what we accept when we work at this club.</p>
      <p>"The key thing whenever we lose a player or a manager is to get the next one in and keep doing it over and over again.</p>
      <p>"It's not easy, don't get me wrong, I'd very much like <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stephen-robinson">Stephen Robinson</a> to remain the Motherwell manager and right now there's been no contact from anybody.</p>

      <p>"From our point of view and Stephen's point of view it's just business as usual.</p>
      <p>"The manager has a notice period, as most people do in their employment, so from that point of view there is some protection there. He just signed a new contract in the summer until 2022 so the club are well protected.</p>
      <p>"We would very much like Stephen to stay here.</p>
      <p>"He's done an excellent job for us in terms of what we ask him to do: developing players, keeping the team competitive in the league, and his recruitment along with Martin Foyle has been excellent.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>"He's almost the quintessential Motherwell manager in terms of what we require, so from that point of view long may it continue.</p>
      <p>"You never know what the future holds in any walk of life so it would be wrong and ill-advised of me to make bold predictions about anybody's future at any football club.</p>
      <p>"What we do is take it one day at a time, right now as we speak Stephen Robinson is the Motherwell manager and I hope it stays that way for as long as possible."</p>
