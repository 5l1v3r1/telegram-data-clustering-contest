      <h3>Adam Jude (7-1)</h3>
      <p><b>Seahawks 31, Buccaneers 26.</b> Trap game? The Seahawks can’t afford to look ahead to next week’s showdown in San Francisco, particularly with their inconsistent performances at home so far this season. Tampa Bay is 2-5; it has lost three straight, and it has one of the NFL’s worst pass defenses of the past five years. The Seahawks <i>should</i> be able to run away with this one in the fourth quarter. Can they?</p>
      <h3>Larry Stone (5-3)</h3>
      <p><b>Seahawks 30, Buccaneers 27.</b> I’m done picking Seahawks’ blowouts. It’s just not in their DNA, even though this is a team they should beat handily. They need to pull it together at home to set up a monumental showdown against the 49ers. Matt, if you want to change your pick to a Seattle loss again after looking at this – and I know you are – be my guest.</p>
      <h3>Matt Calkins (4-4)</h3>
      <p><b>Seahawks 24, Buccaneers 14.</b> There are still a lot of questions surrounding the Seahawks, who have struggled against good and bad teams alike. But at home vs. a Tampa Bay team that has lost three in a row seems as close to a lock as you can get. This, of course, means that I have jinxed them and they will fall by three touchdowns, but I’m sticking with the prediction.</p>
