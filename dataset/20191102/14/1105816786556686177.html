      <p><b>ISLAMABAD.: </b>Declaring that the opposition would not settle for anything less than the ouster of Prime Minister Imran Khan, the Rahbar Committee on Saturday said they were considering other options, including en bloc resignation from parliament and a countrywide strike call in case the government did not meet their demand.</p>
      <p>Addressing a press conference in Islamabad on Saturday, JUI-F leader Akram Durrani flanked by other members of the committee said they had signed an agreement with the Islamabad deputy commissioner for the march and they would stand by it.</p>
      <p>“Besides resignations from parliament and strike, blocking highways, and locking down the whole country at district level and all other options necessary for any movement are also being considered,” said Durrani.</p>
      <p>Durrani insisted that the principal demand of the opposition was the “resignation of Prime Minister Imran Khan”.</p>
      <p>He said there would be no talks with the government if their foremost demand was not met, adding that the tone of the prime minister and his negotiating team head was not good.</p>

      <p>“We don’t refuse to engage in talks but the government’s attitude is not appropriate,” he said, adding that “any irresponsible action by non-democratic forces” would be against national interest. All opposition parties are unanimous on this point and oppose it.”</p>
      <p>Speaking on the occasion, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Secretary General Ahsan Iqbal said he was shocked to know that Prime Minister Imran had waived the mandatory requirement of passport for the visiting Sikh pilgrims from</p>
      <p>India.</p>
      <p>“We welcome the Sikh pilgrims, who are set to visit the country for Baba Guru</p>
      <p>Nanak’s 550th birth anniversary next week, but how an Indian citizen could enter the Pakistani territory without the basic document … it means you are changing the status of that territory,” he added. “This government has turned Pakistan into a laughing stock with blunders such as this.”</p>
