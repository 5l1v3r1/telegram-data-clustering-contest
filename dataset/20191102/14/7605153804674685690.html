        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 2 – Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has endorsed Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) contender Imran Okoth, in a major boost to his candidature for the up-coming Kibra by-election.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Mutua announced the endorsement on Saturday, shortly after a meeting with ODM party leader Raila Odinga, while in the company of political players from Ukambani.</b>
      </p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>The Maendeleo Chap-Chap party leader said he is set to join Odinga for a major rally in Kibra on Sunday, as candidates make a last-minute rash to woe voters, in a crowded contest.</p>
      <p>“I hereby today endorse Imran Okoth because we want out country to develop and do away with poverty,” he said amidst cheers.</p>
      <p>The race has seen candidates try to marshal support along tribal lines, in the cosmopolitan city constituency, largely perceived as an ODM stronghold.</p>
      <p>Okoth, McDonald Mariga of the ruling Jubilee Party and Eliud Owalo of Amani National Congress are the frontrunners of a seat that fell vacant following the death of the late Ken Okoth, in July.</p>
      <p>The Machakos Governor said, Okoth, just like his late brother had the ability to steer Kibra forward.</p>
      <p>While largely peaceful, the campaigns have witnessed pockets of violence, as rival groups clashes, prompting the electoral body to summon the candidates involved.</p>
      <p>“Those urging violence should stop and instead sell policies. Kibra will be changed by development and not insults or violence,” DP Ruto said during the campaigns last week.</p>
      <p>“Kibra is a small place. It is home to people from Nyanza, Central, Western, Rift-Valley, Coast and Ukambani. We want leaders who will bring positive change to the area,” he added.</p>
      <p>According to the IEBC, there are 118,658 registered voters in Kibra.</p>
      <p>On October 28, the poll agency announced the by-election will be conducted in 36 polling stations and relocated of 26,788 voters ahead of the poll.</p>
