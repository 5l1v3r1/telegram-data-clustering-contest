      </ul>
      <p>Tributes have been paid to motorcycle racer Afridza Munandar after the Indonesian was killed in a crash at Malaysia’s Sepang International Circuit on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old went down at turn 10 on the first lap of the Idemitsu Asia Talent Cup, a feeder competition for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/motogp">MotoGP</a>. Munandar received medical attention at the side of the track and was then taken to hospital in Kuala Lumpur, but died as a result of his injuries.</p>
      <p>British rider Cal Crutchlow tweeted: “Really sad news. Thoughts are with Afridza and all his family and friends at this time. Rest in peace.” The defending world MotoGP champion, Marc Márquez, said it was a “sad day for motorcycling. RIP Afridza”.</p>
      <p>Marquez’s Spanish compartiot, Álex Rins, tweeted: “Our sport can be very tough sometimes. Rest in peace Afridza Munandar. Our hearts are with his family and friends</p>
      <p>The race was stopped immediately with a red flag and then cancelled, although racing is expected to resume at the circuit on Sunday after Munandar’s fellow riders voted to continue.</p>
      <p>“Any rider who subsequently chooses not to race has our full support and understanding,” organisers said. “The race will be in memory of Afridza Munandar.”</p>
      <p>Munandar was one of the championship contenders heading into this weekend’s finale of the 2019 IATC, having recorded two wins and four podium finishes this season.</p>
