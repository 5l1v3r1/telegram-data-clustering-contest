      <p>Zinedine Zidane’s side were active in the latest transfer window in which they spent more than €300 million (R5 billion) in transfers to bolster their squad.</p>
      <p>One of the new arrivals was Serbian striker Luka Jovic who joined Real for a reported fee of €60 million (R1 billion) after excelling with Bundesliga side Eintracht Frankfurt last season.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old has struggled to live up to expectation, however, and was heavily criticized after drawing a blank in each of his first nine appearances for the club.</p>

      <p>Jovic broke his drought with a goal in the LaLiga giants' 5-0 win over Leganes on Wednesday and the former Benfica forward has now responded to his critics.</p>
      <p>" It was a difficult period for me, for my career,” he revealed to <i>Marca</i>.</p>
      <p>“Although I have never doubted my quality, nor have the people close to me, like my colleagues and my coach, the public was very hard and it was not pleasant to read those articles. I hope they will start trusting me more.”</p>
