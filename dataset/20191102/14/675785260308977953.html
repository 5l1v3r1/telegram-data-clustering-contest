      <h2>BOURNEMOUTH 1-0 MAN UTD: Josh King scored the only goal as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side fell to defeat</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T14:27:56+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 14:27</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United's</a> recent mini-revival came screeching to a halt with a disappointing defeat to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> on the south coast.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's Red Devils had won three successive away matches before arriving at Dean Court.</p>
      <p>But they never looked like making it four in a row with a poor performance as they fell to a 1-0 loss.</p>
      <p>Former United youngster Josh King scored the only goal on the stroke of half-time, turning in the penalty area and firing a bouncing ball past David de Gea.</p>

      <p>If Solskjaer had hoped for a reaction in the second half then he was left bitterly disappointed, Cherries' goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale barely making a save worthy of note.</p>
      <p>Substitute Mason Greenwood hit the post late on, but Bournemouth deserved their victory.</p>
      <p>Here are the player ratings from Dean Court...</p>
      <h3>David de Gea 6</h3>
      <p>Couldn't do anything about the goal. Made a couple of good stops in either half and dealt with the routine when necessary too.</p>
      <h3>Aaron Wan-Bissaka 5</h3>
      <p>Made a fine tackle to deny Fraser a run on goal early in the first half, but badly failed to deal with King for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> goal. Subbed.</p>

      <h3>Victor Lindelof 4</h3>
      <p>Very uncomfortable day for the Swedish defender. Failed to cope with the movement of King or the physical presence of Callum Wilson. Booked.</p>
      <h3>Harry Maguire 5</h3>
      <p>Solid defensively, but when you were looking for him to step out with the ball, he too often took the easy option, rather than forcing the issue.</p>

      <h3>Ashley Young 5</h3>
      <p>Back in the side, the captain had a difficult time up against Harry Wilson. Never really got forward on the overlap either.</p>
      <h3>Scott McTominay 6</h3>
      <p>Steady in midfield and didn't shirk the physical battle against either Jefferson Lerma or Phillip Billing. However, did he do enough with the ball? You'd have to say no.</p>

      <h3>Fred 5</h3>
      <p>Having been quite decent at Norwich last weekend, this was a listless performance from the Brazilian. Booked in the first half.</p>
      <h3>Daniel James 5</h3>
      <p>Had a decent first half and tested Sergio Rico with his pace down the right. Non-existent in the second period.</p>

      <h3>Andreas Pereira 4</h3>
      <p>Had absolutely no impact on proceedings whatsoever. Probably his poorest display of the season.</p>
      <h3>Marcus Rashford 5</h3>
      <p>Nowhere near his midweek exploits in more mundane surroundings</p>
      <h3>Anthony Martial 5</h3>
      <p>Some nice touches and a couple of smart runs, but little real threat offered in the final third.</p>
      <p><b>Subs:</b> Lingard 5 (Pereira 68'), Greenwood (James 80'), Williams (Wan-Bissaka 80')</p>
      <p><b>Bournemouth XI:</b> Ramsdale 6; Smith 6, Cook 6, Ake 8, Rico 6; Wilson 6, Billing 7, Lerma 7, Fraser 7; King 7, Wilson 7.</p>
