      <h1>Garda rep on border region: 'We are policing with one hand tied behind our backs'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T14:57:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 14:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>The Garda Representative Association's described the rise in violence in the border region as an attack on our democracy.</p>
      <p>It says while extra armed support units in the area are welcome, frontline gardaí are crying out for better resources to tackle the issue.</p>
      <p>It follows recent arson attacks on a garda station and Sinn Féin TD's car and the abduction and violent assault on Quinn Industrial Holdings chief operating officer Kevin Lunney.</p>
      <p>GRA Representative for the Cavan-Monaghan area, James Morrisroe, says urgent action is needed.</p>
      <p>"We have to get the local armed response unit up and running," said Mr Morrisroe.</p>
      <p>"That takes money, that takes resources and we all hear about restrictive budgets but you can't have restrictive budgets like this where you can't foresee what is going to happen.</p>
      <p>"So, they have to get real with it, they have to put the resources in locally and put us back out in the community and we will police it."</p>
      <p>Mr Morrisroe said that his members are being stretched by the shortfall in resources.</p>
      <p>"There is a lack of budget for training, there's a lack of budget for resources, there's a lack of budget for technology.</p>
      <p>"Three years ago, we were promised that we would have mobile devices. We were promised 15,000 of these devices three years ago and we still haven't received them.</p>
      <p>"It is an absolute farce. They are not putting the money into the technology but we are policing with one hand tied behind our backs."</p>
