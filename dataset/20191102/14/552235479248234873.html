      <p>A schoolboy terrorised by teen thugs who stole his bike is on a mission to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/industrial-action">stop bullies</a> in their tracks.</p>
      <p>Sonni Murray was selling tablet and macaroon bars on his bike in the Moredun area of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/man-arrested-charged-after-850k-20793357">Edinburgh</a> when a gang of up to 12 teenagers dragged him off the road and forced him to fight.</p>
      <p>They first pounced on him in the grounds of Liberton High School, where the gang made Sonny fight another boy.</p>
      <p>He was then forced into a playpark at Glenvarloch Crescent where he was beaten again.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/vicious-thug-kicks-victims-head-20381249">brutal attack</a> on Wednesday left the tearful ten-year-old with a burst lip and swollen face.</p>

      <p>But Sonni, known as Sonni Boy by loved ones, is determined to make the best out his ordeal, and launch an anti-bullying campaign.</p>
      <p>Sonni's dad, who asked not to be named, told the Record: "We've been overwhelmed by the support from the local community after Sonni was attacked.</p>
      <p>"Two online fundraising pages have been set up to replace his stolen bike.</p>
      <p>"Over £4,300 has been raised between the two sites.</p>
      <p>"Sonni is so grateful, but that's far too much.</p>
      <p>"He wants to put the money to good use and help others."</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Schoolboy Sonni came up with the idea of an anti-bullying campaign to help others who endured cruel taunts or violence just like him.</p>
      <p>"The idea is to put a cap on the money that has been raised so far, and put that into a separate Go Fund Me page," Sonni's dad added.</p>
      <p>"That money can then be used to get the ball rolling with the campaign.</p>
      <p>"We're unsure at this stage whether we'd want to get schools or the council or charities involved.</p>
      <p>"But already a group of bikers have been in touch saying that they would take the campaign across the country.</p>
      <p>"It's all about raising awareness.</p>
      <p>"The support in just a couple of days has been amazing."</p>
