      <p>An easyJet flight was forced to abandon take-off over the 'abusive, threatening behaviour' of two passengers on board.</p>
      <p>The two passengers were removed from the Amsterdam-bound flight at Manchester airport on Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Pictures shared with <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/passengers-remove-manchester-amsterdam-flight-17187795">Manchester Evening News</a> show airport police on board the EZY1837 plane and a man in red t-shirt is seen walking down the aisle.</p>
      <p>The pair were eventually escorted off the plane and brought for further investigation by the police.</p>
      <p>The incident happened after the flight had left the gate and was on its course to the runway.</p>
      <p>However, the pilot decided to turn back to the apron due to the rowdy behaviour.</p>

      <p>All other passengers had to disembark the plane and were told to wait at the boarding gate while the police officers were dealing with the situation.</p>
      <p>The flight was scheduled to depart at 11:35am but was delayed for two-and-a-half hours.</p>
      <p>It arrived Amsterdam at 4:24pm local time.</p>
      <p>EasyJet issued a statement, which read: "We can confirm that flight EZY1837 from Manchester to Amsterdam was required to return to stand and met by police due to two passengers behaving disruptively onboard.</p>

      <p>"The safety and wellbeing of passengers and crew is always our highest priority."</p>
