        <b>WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - California has appointed an energy czar to develop a plan for a possible state takeover of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) after the utility company left millions in the dark during recent wildfires, Governor Gavin Newsom said in a statement.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wildfires raged across California this month due to strong winds that forced PG&amp;E to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910301077177597-utility-company-set-to-leave-15-million-without-power-in-california-amid-wildfires/">leave around 1.5 million without power</a>. A state regulator launched a probe on Monday into the unprecedented number of so-called Public Safety Power Shut-offs (PSPS) as wildfires threatened California residents.</p>
      <blockquote>"The state will not hesitate to step in and restructure the utility", Newsom said on Medium.com on Friday. "To that end, I have tapped my Cabinet Secretary, Ana Matosantos, to serve as the state’s Energy Czar to lead a dedicated energy team… and prepare a plan should the state need to intervene. All options are on the table".</blockquote>
      <p>Long and widespread blackouts highlighted PG&amp;E's "culture of ineptitude" and resistance to change, the governor added.</p>
