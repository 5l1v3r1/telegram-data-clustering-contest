      <p>A Russian air strike killed on Saturday six civilians including a child in the embattled opposition bastion of Idlib in northwestern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.<br/><br/>The strike hit the village of Jaballa in the south of the Idlib region, taking the lives of all six from the same family, it said.<br/><br/>The monitor, which relies on sources inside Syria, says it determines who carries out an air strike according to flight patterns, as well as aircraft and ammunition involved.<br/><br/>Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said it was the bloodiest such Russian air raid in two months since Moscow announced a truce for the surrounding area on August 31.<br/><br/>Since then, eight other civilians have been killed in Russian air strikes on different dates in the region, he said.<br/><br/>Bashar al-Assad's forces launched a devastating military campaign against Idlib in April, killing around 1,000 civilians and forcing more than 400,000 people to flee their homes.<br/><br/>But a ceasefire announced by the regime's major backer Moscow has largely held since late August, though the Observatory says skirmishes persist.</p>
