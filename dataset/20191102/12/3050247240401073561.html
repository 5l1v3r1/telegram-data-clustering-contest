      <h1>Former US Congressman Ron Paul Receives His First Bitcoin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T12:02:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 12:02</time> by <a rel="author">Adrian Zmudzinski</a></address>
      <p>Former Texas Republican congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul received his reportedly first Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) from Bitcoin Foundation board member and Bitcoin wallet startup Ballet Crypto founder, Bobby Lee, on Oct. 28.</p>
      <h3>Ron Paul now owns a gold plated Bitcoin wallet</h3>
      <p>Lee publicly <a href="https://twitter.com/bobbyclee/status/1190562559658622977">announced</a> the gift he had given to Paul on Nov. 2, noting that the coin has been loaded into a gold-plated Bitcoin <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bobby-lee-takes-on-hardware-wallets-with-new-device-for-30-cryptos">wallet</a> produced by his company Ballet Crypto. He added that extra care has been given to customizing the wallet to better suit the former congressman:</p>
      <blockquote>“It was a special serial number AA000820 to match his birthday! And he loves the #Gold color.”</blockquote>
      <p>The wallets produced by Lee’s company are non-electronic physical wallets meant for cold storage of cryptocurrency. Their format is similar to that of a credit card, and they feature the passphrase of the wallet under a scratchable layer.</p>
      <h3>Freedom of money</h3>
      <p>Paul received the gift at a lunch that took place at the Litecoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ltc-price-index">LTC</a>) summit 2019, also in the presence of Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, who <a href="https://twitter.com/bobbyclee/status/1188994376912949249">said</a> that all three of them share some ideals:</p>
      <blockquote>“We are all #libertarian — personal liberty and #freedomofmoney.”</blockquote>
      <p>Paul — an outspoken critic of the Federal Reserve — is known for his advocacy of gold. With regards to Bitcoin, Paul <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ron-paul-im-all-for-cryptocurrencies-i-like-competing-currencies">noted</a> in July that he’s in favor of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology because he supports competing currencies.</p>
      <p>Paul’s stance is also in stark contrast with the ideas of U.S. congressman Brad Sherman, who believes that cryptocurrencies — potentially competing with the national currency, i.e. the dollar — should be banned. In late October, he <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-congressman-warns-crypto-may-displace-or-interfere-with-dollar">said</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Cryptocurrency either doesn’t work, in which case investors lose a lot of money, or it does achieve its objectives perhaps and displaces the U.S. dollar or interferes with the U.S. dollar being virtually the sole reserve currency in the world.”</blockquote>
      <p>On the other hand, not all U.S. representatives share Sherman’s dollar maximalist view. As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/two-pro-crypto-us-congressmen-note-bitcoin-white-papers-11th-birthday">reported</a> this week, two congressmen showed support on Bitcoin’s 11th birthday, noting that the technology has created “infinite possibilities for technological innovation and privacy protections.”</p>
