      <h1>Donald Trump jokes Melania wouldn't cry if he was shot in speech on real shooting</h1>
      <h2>The President of the US made the remarks at a fundraiser for Republicans running for the House of Representatives</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T12:53:35+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 12:53</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>Donald Trump joked that his wife Melania would not cry if he was shot in a speech about an actual shooting.</p>
      <p>During a fundraiser for Republicans running for the House of Representatives, the US President delivered a joke laden speech.</p>
      <p>In a section about Rep. Steve Scalise - who was seriously injured in a shooting while at a congressional baseball practice - the former Apprentice star riffed on the topic of marital strife.</p>
      <p>Trump said Jennifer Scalise, Steve's wife, "cried her eyes out when I met her at the hospital that fateful day," setting himself up for the punchline.</p>
      <p>"I mean, not many wives would react that way to tragedy, I know mine wouldn’t," he said, <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/huddle/2019/10/31/inside-trumps-roast-of-house-republicans-487560?cid=su_tw_hu">Politico</a> reported.</p>

      <p>As well as drawing attention to the President's 'sense of humour', the remarks have again put the spotlight on his relationship with Melania.</p>
      <p>On at least two occasions the First Lady has been captured on video refusing to hold hands with Trump.</p>
      <p>Footage shows Melania dropping her husband's hands a mere moment after he clasps it as they arrived in Washington for his innaguration.</p>
      <p>Another clip captures her flicking Trump's hand away while on a trip to Tel Aviv.</p>
      <p>According to Michael Wolff in his book Fire and Fury, Melania cried when Trump was elected into the White House.</p>
      <p>Although this account has been disputed, the former model has seemed curiously emotional disengaged with her husband when reports of his alleged affairs have surfaced.</p>
      <p>When confronted with the allegations of infidelity, Melania said: “I have much more important things to worry about and to do.”</p>
      <p>On Thursday night, it was revealed Trump and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/melania-trump">Melania Trump</a> are changing their primary residency for tax purposes from New York to Florida. </p>
