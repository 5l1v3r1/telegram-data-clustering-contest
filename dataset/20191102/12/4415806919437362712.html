      <h1>Rory McIlroy leads WGC-HSBC Champions heading into final round</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T12:45:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Rory McIlroy claimed the outright lead at the WGC-HSBC Champions in China with a third successive five-under round of 67.</p>
      <p>McIlroy closed day two one shot behind Matthew Fitzpatrick but capitalised as the Englishman slipped from the top of the leaderboard on Saturday, finishing with a birdie to head into the final round with a one-stroke advantage over Louis Oosthuizen, who shot 65.</p>
      <p>For the second day running McIlroy hit the turn in 33, but he went bogey-free for the first time this week and added two birdies on the back nine.</p>
      <p>Oosthuizen opened his round with five birdies in pursuit of a maiden World Golf Championships title, while Fitzpatrick dropped to third, two shots off McIlroy alongside Xander Schauffele of the United States.</p>
      <p>England’s Paul Waring is a shot further back in fifth.</p>
      <p>Despite holding the lead, McIlroy saw plenty of room for improvement in his round.</p>

      <p>“I feel like I weathered a mini-storm at the start,” he said. “After that, the round started to get going and I hit some good shots and held some good putts.</p>
      <blockquote>But I gave myself plenty of chances – a lot of chances from between 15 and 20 feet, so you’re not expecting to hole all of them – but I hit a lot of good putts today that didn’t go in.</blockquote>
      <p>“I stayed patient, I birdied the holes that I needed to birdie and I built a very gradual round. No bogeys, which was nice, but just kept plugging away trying to give myself chances.</p>
      <p>“If I go out tomorrow and replicate what I’ve done the first three days, I think I’ll be pretty hard to beat.”</p>
