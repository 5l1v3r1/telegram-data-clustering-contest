      <p>SEPANG, Nov 2 — Race 2 of the Idemitsu Asia Talent Cup (IATC) is set to go ahead at the Sepang International Circuit tomorrow despite a fatal incident on track today.</p>
      <p>Following the incident, Talent Promotion Director Alberto Puig has gathered the IATC riders to ask how they would like to proceed: cancel further track action this weekend or have Race 2 take place.</p>
      <p>According to a statement by Dorna, every rider voted to race tomorrow, therefore Race 2 would go ahead and any rider who subsequently chooses not to race has their full support and understanding.</p>
      <p>“The race will be in memory of Afridza Munandar,” Dorna said in a statement.</p>
      <p>In addition, there would be a minute of silence to remember Munandar at 11.20am on the grid.</p>
      <p>The Indonesian rider died after being involved in an incident at Turn 10 on Lap 1, with the race red flagged immediately thereafter. </p>
      <p>The 20-year-old rider received medical attention by the side of the track before being transferred to Kuala Lumpur Hospital (HKL) by helicopter. — Bernama</p>
