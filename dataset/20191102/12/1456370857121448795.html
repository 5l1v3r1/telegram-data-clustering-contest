        <b>Five Years Ago</b>
      </p>
      <p>This week in 2014, while the EU Court of Justice was ruling that <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141026/06343628941/eu-court-justice-says-embedding-is-not-infringing.shtml">embedding is not infringing</a> in a decision sure to infuriate copyright maximalists, Europe's new Digital Commissioner was on the other side of the coin exploring the idea of an <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141028/10365028966/is-europes-new-digital-commissioner-thinking-imposing-eu-wide-version-germanys-failed-google-tax.shtml">EU-wide Google tax</a>, and Spain passed a new copyright law <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141030/17102328990/spain-passes-copyright-law-demands-payment-snippets-linking-to-infringing-content.shtml">demanding payment for snippets and links</a>. The MPAA was freaking out over the short-lived appearance of Google Glass by banning the technology outright with an announcement hilariously referencing their <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141029/16481228981/mpaa-movie-theaters-issue-complete-ban-google-glass-because-they-have-long-history-welcoming-tech-advances.shtml">"long history of welcoming technological advances"</a>, and one pizzeria was pushing trademark insanity to the limits by <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141022/14431028912/pizzeria-attempts-to-trademark-flavor-pizza-yes-seriously.shtml">trying to trademark the signature flavor of its pizza</a>. Meanwhile, Verizon was continuing its <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141030/07033428985/verizon-title-ii-is-not-answer-except-when-it-gives-us-massive-subsidies-then-its-totally-answer.shtml">fight against net neutrality</a> by launching its own tech blog with an editorial policy <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141028/17160228974/verizon-launches-tech-news-blog-that-bans-any-articles-about-net-neutrality-government-surveillance.shtml">banning any mention of the subject, as well as that of government surveillance</a>.</p>

        <b>Ten Years Ago</b>
      </p>
      <p>This week in 2009, we were disappointed to see <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091026/0353226673.shtml">DMCA abuse by NPR</a> and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091023/1804116661.shtml">silly trademark bullying by SPARC</a>, while not especially surprised to see Amazon fighting hard for its <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091023/1847116662.shtml">infamous one-click buying patent</a> after it was rejected in Canada, or to see Warner Bros. <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091026/0303586670.shtml">shutting down a not-for-profit Harry Potter-themed dinner</a> organized by a fan. The RIAA was on board with net neutrality as long as <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091026/1748286684.shtml">it exempted ISPs blocking file-sharers</a>, an Italian politician was trying to file charges against <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091027/0027446686.shtml">nearly 5,000 YouTube commenters</a>, Japanese prosecutors were still going after <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091027/1302086698.shtml">the developer of a file-sharing program</a>, and an entertainment industry lawyer filed <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091026/0237446669.shtml">a criminal copyright complaint against Google in Germany</a>. This was also the week that <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091026/1104366677.shtml">GeoCities officially went offline</a>, and we had one headline that is especially amusing to see today: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091026/0402356674.shtml"><i>Netflix Claims Americans Don't Want Standalone Streaming Movie Service</i></a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fifteen Years Ago</b>
      </p>
      <p>This week in 2004, more people were continuing to realize that <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041025/0038246.shtml">DRM sucks</a>, while DirecTV was realizing that <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041025/0916220.shtml">satellite internet sucks</a>, and a former RIAA boss was suddenly magically realizing that <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041026/2036254.shtml">Creative Commons doesn't actually suck</a> as much as she thought. The recording industry in Australia was going after the operator of <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041025/091249.shtml">a directory of MP3 download sites</a>, a strange effort by a Spanish company to offer supposedly-legal MP3 downloads ended with <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041025/1553244.shtml">a settlement with the RIAA</a>, and one court got things right when it said <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041026/103208.shtml">Lexmark was abusing the DMCA</a> with its circumvention lawsuit over competing ink cartridges. We also saw a couple companies get badly confused: Rolex (the up-and-coming <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041025/1054235.shtml">favorite brand for spammers</a>) managed to send a cease-and-desist to a mailing list archive because <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041027/0927203.shtml">it <i>received</i> fake Rolex spam</a>, and Nintendo had to apologize after it rushed to threaten the <i>SuicideGirls</i> website over <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041027/1428246.shtml">a model's profile that listed some Nintendo titles among her favorite video games</a>.</p>
