      <h1>Benoit Assou-Ekotto 'told ex-Tottenham coach' of desire to become porn star</h1>
      <h2>Clive Allen claimed the former Spurs left-back said he wanted to go into porn after he retired</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T12:40:07+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 12:40</time> by <a rel="author">Hassan Rashed</a></address>
      <p>Former Tottenham coach Clive Allen has claimed ex-Spurs defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto once told him he wanted to become a porn star when his career ended.</p>
      <p>Former Cameroon left-back Assou-Ekotto played for the North London club between 2006 and 2015, and also represented Queens Park Rangers.</p>
      <p>During his time in the Premier League, the defender developed a reputation as a maverick and previously admitted he only viewed football as just a job and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/01/benoit-assou-ekotto-tottenham-hotspur">'not his passion'.</a></p>
      <p>And former England striker Allen, who worked with Assou-Ekotto during his time as a coach at Spurs, recalled a conversation with the left-back in his new book 'Up Front', where he gave a surprise answer regarding his plans after retirement.</p>

      <p>When he asked by Allen what he planned to do once he finished playing, Assou-Ekotto <a href="https://twitter.com/pbsportswriter/status/1184082352726859776">reportedly said</a> : "'I think I’m going to be a porn star'.”</p>
      <p>Allen's account continued: "He was as calm as you like. 'No, I'm serious. Why not?'</p>
      <p>"I didn't know what to say. I tried to keep it light. ‘Benoit, when you make your first movie, I want tickets to the premiere!’.</p>
      <p>“He didn’t realise I was joking. ‘Coach, no problem at all,’ he replied, absolute deadpan."</p>

      <p>It is not the first time Assou-Ekotto has been surrounded by such claims, with former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> boss Harry Redknapp making similar comments in 2017.</p>
      <p>Redknapp, who managed the defender during spells with both Spurs and Queens Park Rangers, said he wanted to sign the Cameroonian for Birmingham City.</p>
      <p>When asked if there was a chance of Assou-Ekotto joining him a St Andrews, he told the <i>Spurs Show</i> podcast (via the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/harry-redknapp-birmingham-transfer-benoit-assou-ekotto-pornstar-a7757926.html">Independent</a> ): “The only trouble is that he’s admitted he wants to be a pornstar.</p>
      <p>“Maybe I can get another year out of him before he decides to do that."</p>

      <p>However, the 35-year-old was quick to dismiss the idea and laughed off his former manager's comments.</p>
      <p>“It made me laugh, but my mother discovered it this morning, Mother’s Day," he told <i>France Football</i> at the time. "She told me she would have preferred another gift.</p>
      <p>“It was just a joke, it’s not bad. What’s absurd is that we can take it seriously.</p>
      <p>"As if I wanted to become a porn actor! It’s far too taboo.”</p>
