      <p>TV girl Lilian Muli is taking over the airwaves on Hot 96.</p>
      <p>The Citizen TV news anchor took a breather from social media for a week, at least. She is now back and will be entertaining Hot 96 FM listeners from 6 am to 10 am starting Monday through to Friday.</p>
      <p>Making the announcement on Instagram, Muli said, “<i>After a well-Deserved Break I feel great! Nzisa is back this time on your airwaves…@hot96fmkenya @hamoprof.”</i></p>
      <p>The morning show is dubbed “Hot 3 Some” and will be hosted by Muli, comedian Profesa Hamo and a third individual who we can reveal is Patrick Igunza.</p>

      <p>The show, known as “Jeff and Hamo in the Morning” was hosted by the comedian and JKL host Jeff Koinange.</p>
      <p>Koinange will be leaving for New York for a period of two weeks, sources have intimated.</p>
      <p>After announcing her taking a break from the social media life, others thought the TV siren was heavy with third child.</p>
      <p>Others thought she was unwell. Well, it seems like she was getting ready for the new phase in her life.</p>
