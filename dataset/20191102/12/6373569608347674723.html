      <h2>Severe overnight winds caused significant damage to parts of the roof at Home Park</h2>

      <p>Plymouth Argyle's League Two game against Grimsby Town this afternoon has been postponed.</p>
      <p>Significant damage to the roof of Home Park was caused by severe winds overnight, making parts of the stadium unsafe for sectators.</p>
      <p>With winds still gusting to gale-force at times, it has been impossible to safely access the roof to make repairs.</p>
      <p>A cluib statement issued shortly before 12.30pm read: "With supporters' safety of paramount concern, and following consultation with the police and safety experts, we have been advised that we are not allowed to open the stadium.</p>
      <p>"Therefore, regrettably we have been left with no option but to call off the game.</p>
      <p>"In keeping with the rest of Home Park, the roof was assessed during the summer and passed independent stringent safety and structural tests.</p>
      <p>"We are content that the overnight damage was unavoidable.</p>
      <p>"Details of the re-arranged fixture and associated ticketing information will be released as soon as we have them.</p>
      <p>"Tickets for the match will be valid for the re-scheduled game."</p>
