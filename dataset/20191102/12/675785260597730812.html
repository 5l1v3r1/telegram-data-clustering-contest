      <p>Hayley McQueen has shared a picture of her post-baby body just four weeks after giving birth.</p>
      <p>The Sky Sports presenter and her partner Kirk Newmann recently welcomed their daughter Ayla into the world.</p>
      <p>McQueen, who gave birth by C-section, took to social media to share two pictures with her 176,000 followers.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "Once upon a time I’d have been terrified about <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/how-rid-stretch-marks-what-10726483">stretch marks</a> &amp; excessive weight gain.</p>
      <p>"But the only weight I’ve cared about for the last 10 months has been the healthy weight of my unborn baby.</p>
      <p>"I’ve had a couple of negative comments on here from people about this very topic so here I am to address that.</p>

      <p>"It’s taken 39 years for me to post a picture in underwear, I’m at my heaviest but also at my absolute happiest.</p>
      <p>"I can contently look in the mirror at my puffy belly, the overhang above my stitches, stretch marks &amp; scars &amp; feel so proud of what my body has given me."</p>
      <p>McQueen added: "My <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> paints a picture of newborn bliss.</p>
      <p>"Yes Ayla is an angel &amp; a very easy baby thankfully but in reality C section recovery is tough.</p>
      <p>"I was in a world of pain the 1st week, didn’t leave my bedroom for 6 days, just walking to the toilet knocked me breathless.</p>

      <p>"Don’t even talk to me about looking at the stitches or the splitting &amp; pulling from previous surgery.</p>
      <p>"The MRSA meant I had to shower with hospital scrub &amp; wash my hair every single day!</p>
      <p>"I dread Kirk giving me daily painful fragmin injections &amp; my thighs are covered in bruises (42 god damn injections).</p>
      <p>"Oh &amp; my nipples are still raw. Even 4 weeks on I’ve had sudden heavy bleeding so bad it’s knocked me sick."</p>
