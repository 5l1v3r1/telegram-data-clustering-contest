      <p>“I said, ‘This does not belong to me and I need to put this somewhere and return it to someone. I need to go home to my mom and tell her and find out where to take it,” Sinks told the Asbury Park Press.</p>
      <p>Sinks' mother, Tina Trebino, told the newspaper they first planned to give it to the police, but then noticed identifying markings on the ring, including the name of the manufacturer, Gabriel &amp; Co. of New York. The jeweler, she said, then tracked the ring to Bentley Diamond.</p>
      <p>Store records indicated the ring had been purchased by Tony Silva, whose fiancée lost it on the Asbury Park beach more than two years ago, <a href="https://www.nj.com/monmouth/2019/10/would-you-turn-in-a-10k-engagement-ring-you-found-on-the-beach-this-nj-teen-did.html">NJ.com reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The ring, valued by Bentley owner Daria Bagheri at $5,000 to $6,000, features a round-cut diamond in a white gold setting.</p>
      <p>“In the 40 years we’ve been in business, we’ve never seen anything happen like this,” Baghari told <a href="https://www.nj.com/monmouth/2019/10/would-you-turn-in-a-10k-engagement-ring-you-found-on-the-beach-this-nj-teen-did.html">NJ.com</a>.</p>

      <p>On Oct. 30, Silva trekked from his home in Point Pleasant to Bentley, New Jersey, to reclaim the lost ring. </p>
      <p>Although Trebino told the <a href="https://www.app.com/story/news/local/people/2019/10/30/engagement-ring-lost-asbury-park-beach-found-two-years-later/4098935002/">Asbury Park Press</a> that Silva and his fiancée are still engaged and planning a 2020 wedding, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/11/01/how-teen-tracked-down-owner-an-engagement-ring-buried-beach-two-years/">Washington Post</a> reported Friday that a woman claiming to be the fiancée in question disputed the assertion.</p>
      <p>The woman, identified as Kimberly Robles told the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/11/01/how-teen-tracked-down-owner-an-engagement-ring-buried-beach-two-years/">Post </a>she threw the ring into the sand during a July 2018 argument, and the couple parted ways the following December.</p>
      <p>Sinks, 18, told the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/11/01/how-teen-tracked-down-owner-an-engagement-ring-buried-beach-two-years/">Post </a>she knew tracking down Silva was the right thing to do.</p>
      <p>“I just felt overwhelmingly joyful, and I was so grateful that I was able to experience this with him and be able to reunite him with the ring,” she said.</p>
