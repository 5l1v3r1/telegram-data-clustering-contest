      <p>WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) — Jamie Newman returned from injury to throw for three touchdowns and run for two more as No. 23 Wake Forest beat North Carolina State 44-10 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Newman had missed one game and part of another with a shoulder injury, and his status was uncertain for the long-running instate series. But Newman and the Demon Deacons (7-1, 3-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) got off to a dominating start that had this one wrapped up early.</p>
      <p>Wake Forest said the 34-point margin was its largest ever against an ACC opponent at BB&amp;T Field, where the Demon Deacons began playing in September 1968.</p>
      <p>Newman scored twice on first-quarter keepers, taking a moment to extend his arms to the side in celebration as he crossed the goal line on a 20-yard run that started Wake Forest’s opening-period romp.</p>
      <p>He also had the first of his three TD throws to Jack Freudenthal in the first quarter, with Wake Forest scoring touchdowns on its first three drives and taking a 24-0 lead early in the second.</p>
      <p>Newman threw for 287 yards and ran for 30 more before checking out late in the third.</p>
      <p>Advertising</p>
      <p>N.C. State (4-4, 1-3) never had an answer, with its defense unable to stop the Demon Deacons and its offense unable to sustain drives with first-time starting quarterback Devin Leary.</p>
      <p>The redshirt freshman completed 17 of 45 passes for 149 yards and a second-quarter touchdown but had two interceptions. There was also Keyon Lesane’s fumbled kickoff return deep in Wolfpack territory that set up Freudenthal’s first TD grab.</p>
      <p>THE TAKEAWAY</p>
      <p>N.C. State: It was another miserable every-other-year trip west to Winston-Salem, where N.C. State has won once since 2001. Worse, it came following an open date that allowed Leary to get plenty of first-team practice reps to prepare as the Wolfpack’s third starting QB this season in an attempt to regroup for a November push.</p>
      <p>Wake Forest: The open week bought time for Newman to get healthy for the only team still with a chance to interrupt fourth-ranked Clemson’s march to yet another ACC Atlantic Division title. The Demon Deacons were 0-7 under coach Dave Clawson when emerging from an open week, but they ended that drought by beating the Wolfpack for the third straight year.</p>
      <p>POLL IMPLICATIONS</p>
      <p>The margin was impressive enough to potentially give the Demon Deacons a boost in the AP Top 25 poll, as was seeing Newman back at the helm of the offense.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>N.C. State: Reigning national champion Clemson visits the Wolfpack next Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Wake Forest: The Demon Deacons visit Virginia Tech next Saturday.</p>
