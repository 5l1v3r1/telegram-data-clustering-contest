      <p>COLOMBO, Nov 2 ― Sri Lanka's economy was slowly recovering from the impact of the Easter Sunday suicide bombings that killed hundreds and crippled the booming tourism sector, the International Monetary Fund said today.</p>
      <p>Growth was likely to hit 3.5 per cent next year from this year's forecast of 2.7 per cent, the Washington-based lender said, compared to 3.2 per cent in 2018.</p>
      <p>The country estimates it will lose about US$1.5 billion in tourism revenue this year as a result of a sharp dip in arrivals following the jihadist attacks on churches and hotels, which killed at least 269 people.</p>
      <p>“The authorities are taking actions to mitigate the revenue shortfalls caused by the terrorist attacks and preserve the hard-won gains made under the programme,” said IMF deputy managing director Mitsuhiro Furusawa in a statement.</p>
      <p>Furusawa's comments coincided with the latest tranche of a US$1.5 billion (RM6.2 billion) IMF bailout package for Sri Lanka first approved in 2016.</p>
      <p>He warned that Sri Lanka would need to maintain fiscal discipline in order to rein in public debt, while acknowledging the need for urgent social and investment spending.</p>
      <p>Sri Lanka votes in presidential polls on November 16 and parliamentary elections next year, raising fears of welfare spending at the cost of a budget black hole.</p>
      <p>Official figures show that Sri Lanka will have to repay a record US$5.9 billion in foreign loans this year. ― AFP</p>
