      <h1>Odd-even scheme: Ola, Uber to deactivate surge pricing for 12 days in Delhi</h1>
      <h2>In a statement issued on Saturday, Ola said it will extend its support to the Delhi government's initiative to curb pollution</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T05:10:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 05:10</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>Cab aggregators <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ola">Ola </a>and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/uber">Uber </a>have said that they will not resort to surge pricing during the 12-day odd-even road rationing scheme starting from November 4.</p>
      <p>In a statement issued on Saturday, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ola">Ola </a>said it will extend its support to the Delhi government's initiative to curb pollution. The implementation of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/odd-even-scheme">odd-even scheme </a>offers an opportunity to further unlock the potential of shared mobility.</p>
      <p>"Continuing our efforts to provide commuters an optimum and seamless experience, we will have no peak pricing on rides booked on the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ola">Ola </a>platform during the odd-even period. We encourage all driver-partners, passengers, and citizens to participate and make the third edition of the scheme, a success," Arun Srinivas, the chief sales and marketing officer at Ola, said.</p>
      <p>Last month, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/uber">Uber </a>had announced to deactivate surge pricing during the implementation of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/odd-even-scheme">odd-even scheme </a>in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">national </a>capital.</p>
      <p>"We want to do our part in ensuring movement around the city is easy during the odd-even phase and have decided to deactivate dynamic pricing for the duration. We wholeheartedly support Delhi government's move and wish it success," an <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/uber">Uber </a>spokesperson told PTI last month.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/odd-even-scheme">odd-even scheme </a>is a much needed step to reduce pollution and help reduce congestion in the capital, the spokesperson had said.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that surge pricing would not be applied by app-based cabs during the odd-even scheme.</p>
      <p>According to the Delhi government, advisories have also been issued to autorickshaws and e-rickshaws to avoid over-charging from commuters.</p>
      <p>An Ola spokesperson said the company will also work closely with its driver-partners to ensure maximum availability of vehicles during peak hours as well as during the staggered office timings.</p>
      <p>The odd-even scheme was notified on Friday by the Delhi government. Odd and even numbered (last digit of registration number) vehicles ply on alternate days of the scheme.</p>
      <p>The government has not exempted CNG-driven private vehicles from odd-even scheme this time. It has, however, exempted two-wheelers that form around 88 per cent of total registered vehicles plying on the city roads.</p>
