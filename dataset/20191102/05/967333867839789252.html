      <p>The ''permitless carry'' gun law came into effect in Oklahoma on Friday, media reported. The law allows Oklahomans over 21 to open or conceal carry a gun without a license or special training, except for those convicted of certain crimes and non-residents.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma's authorities, however, warned that firearms are still restricted at public buildings, including bars, schools, sporting events and also on college campuses.</p>

      <p>The law takes effect after Rep. Jason Lowe's petition against ''permitless carry'' was blocked by Oklahoma's Supreme Court earlier this week.</p>
      <p>The "permitless carry'' law was signed by Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt in February.</p>
      <p>US citizens are allowed to keep and bear arms in accordance with the Second Amendment, therefore, this right is often referred to as ''constitutional carry".</p>
