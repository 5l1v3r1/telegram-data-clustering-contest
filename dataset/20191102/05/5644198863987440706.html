      <p>REUTERS: A multistate outbreak of salmonella linked to ground beef has caused one death in California and eight hospitalizations, US health officials said on Friday.</p>
      <p>A total of 10 people in six US states were infected with a strain of the bacteria called Salmonella Dublin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

      <p>The illnesses from this strain, a type usually found in cattle, are more severe than expected for salmonella, which usually has a 20 per cent hospitalization rate, the agency said.</p>
      <p>The patients were between 48 and 74 years and 80 per cent of them were male, the agency said.</p>
      <p>Retailers can continue to sell ground beef and consumers can consume thoroughly cooked beef, the CDC said.</p>
      <p>No common supplier of ground beef has yet been identified.</p>
