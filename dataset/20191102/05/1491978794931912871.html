        <i>Mahathir Mohamad says amount is insufficient but a better offer might lead Malaysia to drop its demand for US$7.5bn</i>
      </p>
      <p>Malaysia has rejected an offer from Goldman Sachs of less than US$2bn in compensation over the 1MDB scandal, in contrast to the country’s publicly stated demand of US$7.5bn. <br/><br/>Malaysia has charged Goldman and 17 current and former directors of its units for allegedly misleading investors over bond sales totalling US$6.5bn that the US bank helped raise for the sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB). <br/><br/>“Goldman Sachs has offered something like less than $2bn,” the Malaysian prime minister, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/mahathir-mohamad">Mahathir Mohamad</a>, told the Financial Times on Friday. “We are not satisfied with that amount so we are still talking to them … If they respond reasonably we might not insist on getting that $7.5bn.”</p>
      <p>Goldman declined to comment to the newspaper. The bank did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Goldman said last month it was in discussions with authorities on the possibility of a resolution of investigations relating to 1MDB. <br/><br/>A spokesman for Mahathir travelling with the leader could not immediately be reached. <br/><br/>US authorities say about US$4.5bn was siphoned from 1MDB, founded in 2009 by the then Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak. The scandal helped Mahathir hand a surprise defeat to Najib in a general election last year.<br/><br/>Mahathir told the Financial Times the south-east Asian country was not negotiating or in contact with the fugitive financier Jho Low, accused of playing a central role in the scam. <br/><br/>Low has consistently denied wrongdoing and says he does not expect a fair trial in Malaysia as long as Mahathir is in power. <br/><br/>The US Justice Department said this week it had struck a deal to recover US$1bn in funds allegedly looted from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/1mdb">1MDB</a> from Low, in a record haul for an US anti-corruption probe. <br/><br/>The deal does not include an admission of guilt or wrongdoing and is not tied to criminal action against Low. <br/><br/>Mahathir said on Thursday that Malaysia would file a claim on Low’s forfeited assets. <br/>“The DoJ has indicated that if we can prove claim of ownership, then we will be able to get the money for ourselves,” he said.</p>
