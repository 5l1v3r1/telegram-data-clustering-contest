      <p>Beer filtered with asbestos could be the reason behind a dramatic increase of gullet cancer in men, scientists claim.</p>
      <p>The use of asbestos in beer was popular until the 80s as it filtered impurities from the drink.</p>
      <p>Some pub owners added a handful of asbestos into "slops" at the end of shift and left it overnight for 'cleansing'.</p>
      <p>They would then serve it to customers the next day.</p>
      <p>Researchers at Cambridge and Liverpool universities believe the asbestos put in pints of beer could be the reason behind a fourfold rise in oesophageal cancers.</p>
      <p>Cancer of the gullet - the tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach, currently kills almost 8,000 Brits every year.</p>
      <p>Cases have been on the rise over the past 50 years with 90% occurring in men.</p>

      <p>Dr Jonathan Rhodes said: "Asbestos from beer consumed before around 1980 seems a plausible factor."</p>
      <p>Andy Tighe, of the British beer and Pub association, said asbestos was used in food manufacturing.</p>
      <p>He added: "Itâ€™s difficult to associate health impacts from any one potential source."</p>
