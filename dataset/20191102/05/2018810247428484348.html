      <p><i>Diablo IV</i> is coming, Blizzard said today, finally confirming the much-anticipated sequel after years of speculation.</p>
      <p>A new cinematic trailer for the game showed a group of treasure hunters fighting against what could be demons, or private equity executives.</p>

      <p>Blizzard says the game takes place “many years after the events of <i>Diablo III</i>, after millions have been slaughtered by the actions of the High Heavens and Burning Hells alike. In the vacuum of power, a legendary name resurfaces.”</p>
      <p>This is the fourth mainline entry in the longrunning hack-n-loot series, which began in 1996. The most recent entry, <i>Diablo III</i>, came out in May 2012, recovering from a rocky launch to become one of the most popular PC games of all time.</p>
