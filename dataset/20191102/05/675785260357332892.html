      <p>David Beckham is sure to win dad of the year after bringing his kids trick-or-treating to Justin's Bieber's house for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> .</p>
      <p>The ex footballer said it was the "highlight of her night" for daughter Harper when Bieber and his new wife Hailey opened the door to the kids in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>The impressed dad-of-four uploaded a photo to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> thanking his famous neighbours for spoiling his children.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "Thanks @justinbieber &amp; Haileybieber someone got her snow cone".</p>
      <p>Harper and her brothers Brooklyn and Romeo got dressed up for the night in some show stopping costumes.</p>
      <p>The Beckhams' only daughter dressed as chart topper Billie Eilish, wearing a blue wig with black streaks running down her face as she resembled the singer, 17.</p>

      <p>She completed her new look with a baggy white T-shirt, grey bottoms and some chunky gold necklaces, which she topped off with a cool pose.</p>
      <p>But David also dressed up too as he got into the spirit of the spooky occasion.</p>
      <p>Harper applied make-up around his eyes before he changed into an all-black tracksuit to complete his look as the superhero character Arrow.</p>
      <p>Eldest son Brooklyn decided to transform into a prisoner, wearing a black and white striped matching two piece complete with a number across his chest to bring his outfit to life.</p>

      <p>While in LA, David has treated his kids to other fun things, including a trip to Universal Studios in Hollywood along with Harper and Romeo.</p>
      <p>And he seems to be rocking a different appearance, with his fresh trim looking much shorter than it has been in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>It's also been rumoured the star had forked out on a secret hair transplant after he was spotted with thicker locks and a new hairline last year.</p>
