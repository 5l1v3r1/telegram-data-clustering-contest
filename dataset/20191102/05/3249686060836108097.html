      <p>On the November 1 broadcast of <b>tvN</b>'s '<b>New Journey To The West</b>' season 7, the cast members continued their struggle against the PDs and staff to obtain dinner and breakfast!</p>
      <p>The cast's hilarious 'Name the celebrity by photo' quiz continued this week, with only half of the dinner ingredient left to claim. If you remember last week, while <b>Block B </b>member <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/po">P.O.</a> managed to save face by naming <b>Vladimir Putin </b>in a pinch, <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/eun-ji-won">Eun Ji Won</a> wasn't so lucky when a photo of <b>AOA</b> member <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/seolhyun">Seolhyun</a> came up! All he could manage in the 3 seconds given was <i>"Seol..."</i>. </p>
      <p>This week, Eun Ji Won met yet another female idol foe(?), <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/sunmi">Sunmi</a>! When <b>Na Young Suk</b> PD held up Sunmi's photo before Eun Ji Won's eyes, all he could manage was, once again, <i>"Seol..."</i>! (~ 4:35 mark in clip above)</p>
      <p>Later on, the cast members maintained their fail streak until they eventually ran out of ingredients to bargain for, as <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/kang-ho-dong">Kang Ho Dong</a> brought the games to an end. He was at a loss for words as he couldn't come up with the name of Olympic speedskater <b>Lee Sang Hwa</b>, also well-known as <b>Kangnam</b>'s wife. </p>
      <p>Even more hilarious games awaited the 'New Journey To The West' cast members as in the evening, they played a game to see who could protect their given fruits or produce from the other members. For breakfast instead, the members then played a variety of quiz games pulled from a cup, After some laughs around breakfast time came one of 'New Journey To The West's signature games - the headphone game! <b>Super Junior</b>'s <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/kyuhyun">Kyuhyun</a>, who did not participate in season 6, got to try the headphone game for the first time this season!</p>
