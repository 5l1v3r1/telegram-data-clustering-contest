      <h1>Elizabeth Warren: Laid off healthcare workers can work in auto and life insurance industries</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T02:44:34+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 02:44</time> by <a rel="author">John Gage</a></address>
      <p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren recommended that health insurance workers laid off by her Medicare for All plan switch over to the auto and life insurance industries.</p>
      <p>"Where do those who work in health insurance go when private insurance is eliminated?" a reporter asked the Massachusetts Democrat on Friday.</p>
      <p>Warren responded by saying, "No one gets left behind."</p>
      <p>She then added, "Some of the people currently working in health insurance will work in other parts of insurance. In life insurance, in auto insurance, in car insurance."</p>
      <p>The comments come after Warren agreed in an Wednesday interview that her plan to eliminate private insurance options <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/elizabeth-warren-2m-lost-jobs-part-of-the-cost-of-medicare-for-all">would cost the economy</a> 2 million jobs by disrupting the healthcare industry.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/warren-releases-medicare-for-all-funding-plan-with-nearly-9-trillion-tax-on-employers">2020 contender also released</a> her long-awaited Medicare for All funding plan Friday, which calls for $20 trillion in taxes on employers, financial firms, giant corporations, and the top 1% of earners and is predicted to result in $59 trillion total national healthcare spending over a decade.</p>
