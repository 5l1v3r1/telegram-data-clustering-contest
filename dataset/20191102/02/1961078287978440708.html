      <h1>Elon Musk Bids Twitter Farewell — for Now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T02:44:01+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 02:44</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Vigdor</a></address>
      <p>Elon Musk, who was once fined $20 million by securities regulators for a single tweet about taking Tesla private, is taking a break from Twitter.</p>
      <p>The billionaire co-founder and chief executive of the electric car company announced Friday to his 29 million Twitter followers that he was <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1190292298694680577">“going offline.”</a></p>
      <p>An hour earlier, Mr. Musk, 48, said in separate posts on the social media platform that he was <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1190288216131170305">“not sure about good of Twitter”</a> but that <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1190288778767691777">“Reddit still seems good,”</a> referring to the popular discussion group website.</p>
      <p>Mr. Musk, the entrepreneurial catalyst behind Tesla and SpaceX, the private rocket company and major contractor for NASA, represents a stark contrast from the usually tightly-controlled corporate chiefs on social media.</p>
      <p>Last year, Tesla begrudgingly agreed to settle a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2018/comp-pr2018-219.pdf">securities fraud lawsuit</a> brought against the company and Mr. Musk over an August 2018 tweet in which the maverick businessman said, “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Musk’s tweet sent Tesla’s stock soaring, but securities regulators said in their complaint that Mr. Musk’s signal was misleading and disrupted Nasdaq, the market on which the company’s stock is traded.</p>
      <p>Mr. Musk was forced to pay a $20 million fine and relinquish the chairmanship of Tesla for three years under a settlement reached last fall. But when he was asked about the cost of his tweet by a follower on Twitter, Mr. Musk said it was <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1056012218897059841?s=20">“worth it.”</a></p>
      <p>Mr. Musk subsequently announced that he was taking a break from Twitter for a few days, but he eventually returned to the platform.</p>
