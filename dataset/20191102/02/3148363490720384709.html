      <h1>Beto Out of 2020 Primary -- Promise to Take Guns Failed to Resonate</h1>
      <h2>Robert “Beto” O’Rourke dropped out of the Democrat presidential primary contest on Friday as his promise to confiscate AR-15s and AK-47s failed to resonate.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T02:06:42+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 02:06</time> by <a rel="author">AWR Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>O’Rourke campaigned on a government-mandated buyback of AR-15 rifles that seemed confiscatory. Then on September 12, 2019, he confirmed the confiscatory nature of the push, <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/12/beto-orourke-hell-yes-were-going-to-take-your-ar-15/">saying</a>, “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15.”</p>
      <p>The next day, September 13, he <a href="https://twitter.com/tomselliott/status/1172471677818736640">told</a> MSNBC that the government buyback of AR-15s and AK-47s would not be “voluntary.” Rather, he stressed, “It is not voluntary, I want to be sure we make the distinction here, it is mandatory. It will be the law. You will be required to comply with the law.”</p>
      <p>When O’Rourke’s confiscatory talk appeared to hurt Democrats’ larger gun control efforts, CNN’s Alisyn Camerota tried to give him a way out. She did this by <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/16/beto-orourke-suggests-mass-shooters-will-hand-over-their-ar-15s/">intimating</a> that the ban would only disarm the law-abiding citizens, as criminals would not obey it.</p>
      <p>But when she <a href="https://twitter.com/NRA/status/1184591858967732226">asked</a> O’Rourke if he “[expected] mass shooters to follow the law” he responded in the affirmative, confirming his belief that mass shooters would hand over their AR-15s if the law demanded it.</p>
      <p>Polls did not reward O’Rourke’s gun control push, and on Friday, he announced he was pulling out of the race:</p>

      <p>As things now stand, Beto is out but AR-15s  and AK-47s are in.</p>
