      <p>One of several big announcements from BlizzCon 2019 so far is the reveal of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatch-2-announced-blizzcon-2019/">Overwatch 2</a>, which we've been told will apparently keep all of the original game's heroes, maps, modes and yes, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatch-1-cosmetics-overwatch-2/">even your skins</a>, while adding PvE story missions, a new mode called Push, and some more heroes. BlizzCon attendees were told that Overwatch 2 would be playable right there at the show, and here's proof: Almost two hours of gameplay footage courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3xbjTJT2pVNR6b94Vaei5g">YouTuber ohnickel</a>.</p>
      <p>There's been an engine upgrade, which means you'll see some improvements to character models and larger maps, but it's basically the same Overwatch fans love, expanded.</p>
      <p>We'll have more info about Overwatch 2 tomorrow, when we get a closer look at it. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/blizzcon-2019-announcements/">Follow all our BlizzCon 2019 coverage here</a>.</p>
