      <p>BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump called Argentine President-elect Alberto Fernandez to congratulate the center-left politician for winning Sunday’s election and discuss the South American country’s troubled economy.</p>
      <p>Fernandez sent a tweet saying Trump told him he had “instructed the International Monetary Fund to work with us to resolve the problem of our debt.”</p>
      <p>The IMF extended a $57 billion credit line to the recession- and inflation-racked country last year when a run on the peso currency sparked concerns about a possible sovereign bond default.</p>
      <p>“I thanked him for the gesture and told him of my intention to maintain mature and cordial relationship with the United States,” the tweet said.</p>
      <p>The White House said in a statement the two leaders discussed bilateral relations and that Trump expressed U.S. support for helping Argentina “overcome economic challenges”.</p>
      <p>The IMF deal, negotiated with Argentina’s outgoing President Mauricio Macri, has been in limbo since the Aug. 11 primary election, which Fernandez won by a higher-than-expected margin. The primary result prompted a steep sell-off in Argentine asset prices, and revived debt fears.</p>
      <p>The peso steadied this week, helped by central bank interventions, after Fernandez’s Oct. 27 election win. The currency closed Friday at 59.745 to the U.S. dollar.</p>
