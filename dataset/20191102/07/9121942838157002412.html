      <p>CLEVELAND (AP) — Authorities say a motorist who struck and killed the girlfriend of a Cleveland Browns player will not be charged.</p>
      <p>Cleveland.com reports Cleveland police said Friday that the 47-year-old woman wasn’t impaired, speeding or driving erratically when she struck 26-year-old Petara Cordero in September along Interstate 90. Cordero was the girlfriend of Browns defensive end Chris Smith.</p>
      <p>Police said Smith and Cordero had exited Smith’s 2019 Lamborghini after it blew a tire and hit the center median wall. The woman struck Cordero and the Lamborghini’s front passenger door.</p>
      <p>Cordero was pronounced dead at a hospital.</p>
      <p>The news site reports Smith paid $316 in fines and court costs Thursday for a failure to control citation connected to the initial crash.</p>
      <p>Cordero gave birth to the couple’s daughter just weeks before her death.</p>
