      <h1>Thousands protest to maintain pressure on Chile government</h1>

      <p><b>SANTIAGO: </b>Dressed in black, marching silently and raising one fist, around a thousand women on Friday demanded justice for those killed and injured during the last two weeks of social unrest in Chile.</p>
      <p>Their march started off a day of demonstrations that expanded later as tens of thousands of people answered social media calls to match last Friday’s huge protest that attracted more than a million people.</p>
      <p>“Justice; truth; no to impunity,” chanted the women marchers in front of the presidential palace in central Santiago, as their silent protest burst to life.</p>
      <p>They held up signs paying tribute to the 20 people killed and more than 1,300 injured during the protests, according to statistics provided by the national human rights institute (INDH.)</p>

      <p>Protesters stood in silence holding one fist aloft in front of impassive police guarding the presidential palace on a day in which many were celebrating the Christian festival of All Saints Day.</p>
      <p>“We’re not going to back down until the government answers us about the deaths. We feel betrayed by this government,” Marco, a 22-year-old student, told <i>AFP</i>.</p>
      <p>In the central Plaza Italia square, which has been the epicentre of the protest movement these last two weeks – thousands of people waved Chilean and Mapuche indigenous flags.</p>
      <p>Protesters are angry about low salaries and pensions, poor public health care and education, and a yawning gap between rich and poor in Latin America’s wealthiest country on a per capita basis.</p>

      <p>The unrest began two weeks ago with protests against a rise in transport tickets and other austerity measures descended into vandalism, looting, and clashes between demonstrators and police.</p>
      <p>Many protesters have demanded the resignation of billionaire President Sebastian Pinera.</p>
      <p>He’s announced a series of social measures and a cabinet reshuffle to try to appease the demonstrators, but to no avail.</p>
      <p>Chile’s image took a hit on Wednesday when the government said it was pulling out of hosting the APEC economic summit in November and the December COP climate conference.</p>
      <p>It said it had no choice but to abandon the summits for security reasons.</p>
