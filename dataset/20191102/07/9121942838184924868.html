      <p>BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) — Bournemouth beat Manchester United 1-0 in the Premier League on Saturday to increase the pressure on United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth provisionally climbed to sixth in the table with the win, which was sealed by Joshua King’s goal shortly before halftime.</p>
      <p>The United defense allowed King plenty of time to control Adam Smith’s cross with his chest, flick the ball over his head and knock it through David De Gea’s legs.</p>
      <p>United’s defense was slow to react again in the 74th minute, when De Gea dived at full stretch to push Harry Wilson’s shot wide.</p>
      <p>Defeat in pouring rain on England’s south coast ended a recent resurgence for United. It had won its last three games, but has now also failed to win five of its last six league games.</p>
      <p>United is three points behind Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>King’s strike was Bournemouth’s first league goal since Sept. 28. The Cherries are looking to recover some of their strong early-season form after a five-game winless run in all competitions.</p>
