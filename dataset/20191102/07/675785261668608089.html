      <h1>Joe Marler's wife Daisy is the rock who ensured he played for England at Rugby World Cup</h1>
      <h2>Marler quit England duty just 12 months ago, but with the support of his wife, he reversed his decision and travelled to Japan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T07:13:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 07:13</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/</a></address>
      <p>Joe Marler almost missed out on his chance to play in the Rugby World Cup Final.</p>
      <p>Just twelves months ago, Marler announced that he would be walking away from England duty in order to spend some more time with his family.</p>
      <p>Marler is happily married to long-term partner Daisy, with whom he has three children. Jasper, 5, and Maggie, 3, were joined by another new born just before the World Cup commenced.</p>
      <p>The Harlequins star has admitted that he is not overly comfortable with playing top level sport.</p>
      <p>But the support of Daisy, who works as a full-time mum, allows him to stay on top of his game.</p>

      <p>“My wife, Daisy, is very good at helping me balance the two [rugby and fatherhood]," Marler told FQ Magazine in 2017. </p>
      <p>“Sometimes the team has double-days and I need to get an early night, a decent shut eye.</p>
      <p>“So she’ll do the night shift with the kids.”</p>
      <p>Daisy keeps her personal life private and avoids the media spotlight.</p>
      <p>It is unknown whether they will be flying over to Japan for the Rugby World Cup Final on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Marler himself only made a late decision to play in the competition, after appearing to retire from international rugby 12 months ago.</p>
      <p>"I don’t feel I can give 100 per cent to the England shirt any more," he said in September 2018.</p>
      <p>"That is not fair on myself, the team or my family. I can’t do it anymore.</p>
      <p>"It is not an easy decision. It is something I have been thinking about for some time now.</p>
      <p>"Being with England you have to spend an incredible amount of time away and I could not do that anymore.</p>

      <p>"So now is the time to walk away and get some new blood in the team. And I am looking forward to being able to give my wife and children more of my time."</p>
      <p>But with the support of Daisy, Marler reversed his decision and has since played an important role with the England team.</p>
      <p>And it is one decision he will surely not regret if he goes on to become part of the world champion line-up come Saturday night.</p>
