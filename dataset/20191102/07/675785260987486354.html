      <h2>Manchester United are looking for the fourth away win in a row as they take on Bournemouth in the Premier League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T07:23:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 07:23</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United are back in business.</p>
      <p>After a torrid season to date, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has stopped the rot with three consecutive away wins.</p>
      <p>Victories at Partizan Belgrade, Norwich and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and eased pressure on the under-fire boss.</p>
      <p>But a trip to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> is a different prospect, with United struggling at the Vitality Stadium in recent years.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth are a tough nut to crack and only have one defeat in their last six Premier League outings - and only conceded one goal in the whole of last month.</p>
      <p>Here is all you need to know ahead of the gameâ€¦</p>
