      <p>Arsenal return to Premier League action for the first time since Granit Xhaka’s extraordinary outburst.</p>
      <p>But one week on from his expletive-ridden rant, Xhaka will not be in the squad to take on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>Xhaka sat out of the Carabao Cup thriller with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> on Wednesday night and again will not play a part as Arsenal return to league duties.</p>
