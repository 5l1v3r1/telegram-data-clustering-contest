      <h1>LAX makes changes to new rideshare pick-up system in response to travelers' outrage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T07:03:15+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 07:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://abc7.com/about/newsteam/miriam-hernandez" target="_blank">Miriam Hernandez and Eileen Frere</a></address>
      <p>LAX implemented new measures aimed at reducing chaos and long delays after <a href="https://abc7.com/travel/lax-ride-share-ban-travelers-livid-after-getting-stuck-for-in-shuttle/5659859/">travelers were outraged</a> about getting stuck in a shuttle for nearly an hour on day one of the airport's rideshare ban.<br/><br/>The changes come just days after the airport launched its new "LAX-it" lot Tuesday morning, which is the <a href="https://abc7.com/travel/lax-to-end-curbside-pick-ups-by-rideshare-companies-taxis/5589730/">only place where passengers can now grab a taxi or get picked up by Uber or Lyft</a>.<br/><br/><b><a href="https://abc7.com/travel/lax-ride-share-ban-travelers-livid-after-getting-stuck-for-in-shuttle/5659859/">RELATED: LAX apologizes after livid travelers get stuck for nearly an hour in shuttle on day 1 of ride-share ban</a></b><br/><br/>The airport has a fleet of shuttle buses to carry passengers from the terminals to the "LAX-it" lot, which are scheduled to arrive every 3-5 minutes during peak hours. Passengers said the shuttles did come in a timely manner, but once they boarded the shuttles, it was a different story. Some said they were stuck in the shuttle for up to 40 minutes.</p>

      <p>Airport officials said that the worst snarls were caused by rideshare drivers who were getting conflicting information about how to enter the LAX-it lot. In the last 24 hours, new signs have gone up with bold letters and directions painted on the pavement. More shuttle buses have also been added to the fleet.<br/><br/>Plus, the rideshare companies are now revising maps for their drivers.<br/><br/>"They are putting a lot of effort into the map device, the online maps they are getting and we are seeing a steady improvement everyday," said Deputy Director of LAX Operations Michael Christensen.<br/><br/>Another change: Traffic lanes on the lower level closest to the terminals are now used only by airport shuttles and "LAX-it" buses, meaning drivers must pick up passengers at the outer median.<br/><br/>Officials said the <a href="http://lawa.benchurl.com/c/v?e=F1B5A7&amp;c=D8CC9&amp;t=0&amp;l=&amp;email=IHOdN7%2BjtuN%2BHaxuLYRABw==">the changes</a> are fulfilling their intended purpose of reducing the number of vehicles in the airport's central traffic area where construction projects are underway. LAX reports traffic speeds improved by 35% after the new changes were implemented.<br/><br/>Airport officials also reported that the average shuttle wait time at terminals Thursday was two minutes, and the average time to the "LAX-it" lot on a the shuttle was 11 minutes.<br/>Airport visitor Zach Winick says he has come to airport several times in the last few days and he has noticed the difference.<br/><br/>"Like literally there was no traffic coming into the airport today. I am very happy about that because yesterday it was not that way," Winick said.</p>
