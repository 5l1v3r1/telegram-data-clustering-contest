      <p>Delhi will restrict certain vehicles for 12 days from Monday, enforcing an odd-even scheme based on number plates to reduce hazardous <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/air-pollution">air pollution.</a></p>
      <p>The Delhi government announced the odd-even scheme after a Supreme Court-mandated panel declared public health emergency in the city and directed all construction activities to be stopped till November 5.</p>
      <p>First introduced in 2016, odd-even is a vehicle rationing method that aims at putting a curb on the number of cars on the roads. It allows cars with odd-numbered registration plates to run on odd dates, and those with even-numbered plates on even dates.<br/><br/>The scheme would also be applicable to vehicles that are not registered in Delhi.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the announcement, cab aggregators Ola and Uber said they would deactivate surge pricing for the entire 12 day-period. "The Odd-Even scheme is a much needed step to reduce pollution. We whole heartedly support Delhi government's move and wish it success," a spokesperson from Uber said.</p>
      <p>Here’s a short list of things to know about the scheme</p>
