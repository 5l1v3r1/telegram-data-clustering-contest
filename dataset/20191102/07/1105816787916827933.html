      <h1>Fawad Chaudhry warns opposition not to underestimate the govt</h1>

      <p><b>ISLAMABAD  : </b>Federal Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry on Saturday warned the opposition not to mistake the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government as weak<a href="https://www.express.pk/story/1865556/1/"><i>.</i></a></p>
      <p>The minister took to social media and said the government is exercising self-restraint – over the protest led by JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, pressurising the premier to step down – on the directives of Prime Minister Imran Khan.</p>
      <p>“Don’t dare to underestimate PTI government, we are exercising self-restraint because Imran Khan has desired so,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>The federal minister also noted that if the premier wanted, he could make a phone call to deal with the matter, warning the Azadi march leaders – including PPP, PML-N and JUI-F – that they would not find any place to hide.</p>

      <p>The JUI-F chief has set a two-day deadline for PM Imran to step down.</p>
      <p>“People have given their verdict… they want freedom from this government,” the 66-year-old firebrand cleric said while addressing tens of thousands of opposition workers camping in Sector H-9 on Friday.</p>
      <p>The two opposition parties – PPP and PML-N – have thrown their weight behind the Maulana because their leaders are facing corruption charges which they claim are part of premier Imran’s political vendetta.</p>
      <p>“We want the state institutions to be impartial and withdraw their support to this illegitimate government,” the cleric said, adding that they did not want confrontation with the state institutions.</p>
