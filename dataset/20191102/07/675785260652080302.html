      <h2>Ford will be cheered on from the stands in the Rugby World Cup Final by his long-term partner, who has flown over to Japan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T07:03:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 07:03</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/</a></address>
      <p>George Ford has been one of the key cogs in the England team in their run to the Rugby World Cup Final.</p>
      <p>He's a hard-worker on the pitch, but also one off it... and he was forced to play the long game when trying to hook up with his girlfriend, Jess Portman.</p>
      <p>It took a year after Ford met Jess before they were officially dating, with the fashion designer eventually agreeing to go on a date with him.</p>
      <p>The persistence is said to be something which Jess admires about Ford.</p>
      <p>The pair first met six years ago and now after five years as an item, they are still going strong.</p>

      <p>Jess has been cheering on Ford in Japan for the World Cup over the past week, as she takes a break from her business responsibilities.</p>
      <p>After graduating from Manchester University, where she studied fashion promotions, she now owns her own company called Portman London UK, where he speciality is fashion design.</p>
      <p>The business venture is a relatively new one, where she has been selling boho-inspired designed clothing.</p>
      <p>She is regularly posting pictures of herself to her 15,000 <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> followers and has been chronicling some of her time in Japan on social media.</p>

      <p>She was pictured with a sign that read "Fordy" as she attended the World Cup semi-final win over New Zealand, where Ford played a part, alongside other wives and girlfriends.</p>
      <p>Back home, Jess shares a house with Ford in Leicestershire, where she is form.</p>
      <p>It is doubly ideal as it is close to where the fly-half is based for club rugby duty with the Leicester Tigers.</p>
      <p>The pair do not have any kids just yet, but they do have a dog called Bailee.</p>
