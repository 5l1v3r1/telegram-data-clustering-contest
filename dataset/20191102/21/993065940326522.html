      <p>Grace Carter has said she would consider making more dance floor-focused songs like her close friend Dua Lipa – but that she doesn’t have the moves to match her on stage.</p>
      <p>The singer-songwriter, 22, said her new song, Fired Up, explores her true feelings for her boyfriend, who acts as her producer when they are in the studio together.</p>
      <p>However, Carter, who has toured with Lipa, said she was happy sticking with her own brand of soulful pop music.</p>

      <p>Speaking ahead of the MTV European Music Awards, she told the PA news agency: “I definitely think I have found my sound, especially in the last few months. But I’m never going to say never.</p>
      <p>“I could go down that path but I’m not as good a dancer as she is. I don’t think I would be able to pull it off in the same way.</p>
      <p>“I’m down for the emotional songs. I’m definitely better at that.”</p>
      <p>The singer performed a three-song set in Seville, Spain, on the Saturday before the annual ceremony, which this year sees Ariana Grande and Lil Nas X competing for the top prizes.</p>

      <p>Fired Up is more upbeat than Carter’s previous releases, which have focused on her father’s absence during her youth.</p>
      <p>She said: “I guess I have written a lot of songs about certain things in my life and haven’t really touched on others.</p>
      <p>“I was in LA with my boyfriend and I was doing sessions and I was really struggling in the sessions.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know what I wanted to write about. He produces all of my songs. I took him along to the studio and I had never really told him about how I felt.</p>
      <p>“We had been together for a couple of years, and I wrote a song about the positives in my life rather than all the sad things. It just came together really easily.</p>
      <p>“It just feels like a light and happy song to me. It felt like a transition from all the darker stuff that I have done before.”</p>
