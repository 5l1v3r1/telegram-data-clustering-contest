      <p>There are some unspoken rules when it comes to weddings  - particularly when it comes to upstaging the bride on her big day.</p>
      <p>This newlywed's mum didn't get the memo when she opted to wear a white lace gown to her own daughter's nuptials.</p>
      <p>Facebook users have expressed their horror after they came across this picture on the That’s It, I’m Wedding Shaming group.</p>
      <p>One mortified guest shared the image, and included the caption: “Shaming the s*** out of the mother of the bride.</p>

      <p>“I went to a family wedding over the weekend and the bride was gorgeous, it was such a pretty wedding. [But] her mum wore a white, lace dress.”</p>
      <p>The snap shows the the mother-of-the bride flaunting a white lace midi-dress with long, lacy sleeves accompanied by the bride and</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> users expressed their shock at the woman's</p>
      <p>“Call me old fashioned but I’d be p***** off if anyone besides me wore white to my wedding.”</p>
      <p>Another added: “I don’t know why mothers are like this. I have four kids, two of which are girls. I would NEVER do anything to ruin their day. This is just sad to me.”</p>
      <p>Other Facebook users said the dress looked “cheap” and "classless".</p>
      <p>One outraged user said they would have demanded their mum change into a new dress if she had worn it to her own wedding.</p>
      <p>“I have seen mothers wear white to their daughter’s wedding… 90% of the time it is a white skirt suit or other non-bridal looking gown", another added.</p>
      <p>“If you wear a lacy white gown when your daughter is wearing a lacy white gown as her wedding dress – I shame you.”</p>
