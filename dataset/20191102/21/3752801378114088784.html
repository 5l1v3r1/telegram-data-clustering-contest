      <h1>Cape Town soup kitchen turned into Bok fan lounge for homeless</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T21:45:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 21:45</time> by <a rel="author">Jenni Evans</a></address>
      <p>About 130 homeless people and 30 volunteers watched the Springboks beat England at a special event laid on for them at the Ladles of Love soup kitchen in Cape Town on Saturday. </p>
      <p>"There was a crowd of us watching the semifinal last week and after we just scraped through, we were all just taking a breather and then realised that the final was going to be shown during our Saturday kitchen," said Ladles of Love founder Danny Diliberto.</p>
      <p>"It was at that moment that we realised we had to watch the game with our homeless guests."</p>
      <p>Hilary and Bernard Stern pulled out all the stops and sponsored five big screen TVs and 150 chairs. </p>
      <p>"And what excitement there was among our guests and volunteers. </p>
      <p>"It was beautiful to watch those who have and those who don't have come together with no barriers and love each other as human beings. Couldn't have asked for a more successful day," said Diliberto.</p>
      <p>This was a brief respite from the hardship of life on the street, which controversially included fines for violations of various by-laws. </p>
      <p>A court case following an uproar over this is due to be heard soon. </p>
