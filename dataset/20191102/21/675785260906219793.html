      <h2>The male escort says he has given up prostitution but now wants to help people after 'advice' from the MP himself</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T21:18:10+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 21:18</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Dorman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nick-dorman/</a></address>
      <p>A male escort who exposed sex and cocaine scandal MP Keith Vaz is following in his footsteps – by training to be a lawyer.</p>
      <p>The man revealed he has given up prostitution as he blasted disgraced Vaz, 62, who was given a six-month Parliamentary ban on Thursday.</p>
      <p>He said: “When I met him he told me I should become a lawyer like him and said ‘I’d be f***ing good at it”. So I’ve decided to take his advice so I can help people.”</p>
      <p>Vaz made the remark during a taped meeting with the escort that led to the MP being exposed in 2016.</p>
      <p>His ban was handed down after telling a parliamentary watchdog two male prostitutes he invited to his London flat were decorators he was hiring.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Mirror revealed he paid for sex, asked the men to bring poppers, and offered to cover the cost if cocaine could be supplied.</p>
      <p>But Vaz said he did not want any of the Class A drug himself.</p>

      <p>The escort – who has begun his legal studies – said married dad-of-two Vaz’s suspension from Parliament was not before time.</p>
      <p>“He’s lied, lied and lied again. He has no respect for his constituents, his work or his family,” said the man.</p>
      <p>“The worst thing about him is the way he lied to those closest to him – and caused them so much embarrassment by fighting this.</p>
      <p>"If I was him I’d have gone somewhere quiet and stayed there.</p>
      <p>“He has a wife and children – he’s made things so much worse for them by not admitting what he’s done.”</p>
      <p>Leicester East Labour MP Vaz was heading the powerful Home Affairs Select Committee at the time of the scandal – while it was working on the biggest shake-up in prostitution laws in a generation.</p>
      <p>This week the Standards Committee concluded there was “compelling evidence” Vaz offered to pay for a class A drug and had paid-for sex in August 2016.</p>
      <p>On Friday it emerged he is set to lose the Labour whip after 32 years – but he could remain on the party’s national executive committee.</p>
      <p>The escort said: “Labour should get rid of him altogether. It’s disgusting he is still involved. He’s Teflon.”</p>
      <p>Vaz even tried to cover his tracks by telling the men he was a washing machine repair man named Jim.</p>
      <p>“He lied about everything – even his identity,” said the escort. “He just uses people for his own ends.”</p>
      <p>In a scathing report, the watchdog Standards Committee said there was “convincing evidence” Vaz – a solicitor before he was elected in 1987 – was “evasive or unhelpful” during an investigation into his conduct by Commons standards commissioners Kathryn Hudson and Kathryn Stone.</p>
      <p>A statement on Vaz’s website “vigorously” rejected this allegation.</p>
      <p>He has since said he is being treated for a serious mental health condition.</p>
