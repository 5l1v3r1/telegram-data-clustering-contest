      <p>TOWIE fans are desperate for Pete Wicks and Chloe Sims to get together, and his latest post has only added fuel to the fire.</p>
      <p>On Saturday he took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to wish Chloe a happy 36h birthday with a very cosy looking picture of the two of them.</p>
      <p>In the photo they sit on a rock at the seaside, with Pete planting a kiss on his pretty pal's head as she leaned in close with her hand on his knee.</p>
      <p>Pete told her that he'd be "lost without her" in the caption, which also included a red love heart emoji.</p>

      <p>But Pete recently claimed he'd never date Chloe because he'd be worried about hurting her.</p>
