      <p>PORT MACQUARIE, Australia: Two koalas were rescued from a fire-ravaged area of Australia's east coast on Saturday (Nov 2) but <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/australia-bushfire-hundreds-rare-koalas-dead-new-south-wales-12046628">the fate of hundreds more remains uncertain</a> with blazes still raging in their bush habitat.</p>
      <p>The first koala, named "Corduroy Paul", was found dehydrated amid the devastation some 400km north of Sydney, and was taken to the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital early Saturday morning.</p>

      <p>"He was picked up off the ground and curled up in a little ball, basically not moving," Sue Ashton, the hospital's president, told AFP.</p>

      <p>The juvenile marsupial, weighing just 5kg, is now doing "really well", Ashton said, and was joined later by a female koala called Anwin who is also being treated for dehydration.</p>

      <p>Bushfires blazing in the area have destroyed thousands of hectares over the past week, including a densely populated habitat of "very rare" koalas.</p>
      <p>A further four more koalas are to be picked up on Sunday after being spotted in the bushland on the outskirts of the fire, the hospital said.</p>

      <p>Hundreds of the creatures are feared to have died in the fires, and as the days go by a lack of water is further hampering their chances of survival.</p>
      <p>"That is our concern, not only that they are burnt, but that they are now dehydrated," Ashton said.</p>
      <p>"They are going days without water, or leaf - which gives them 65 per cent of their water," she added.</p>
      <p>Land clearing and development has devastated the tree-dwelling koalas' habitat, leading to increased inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity of the marsupial.</p>
      <p>More than 60 fires were burning on Saturday afternoon across the state of New South Wales, which has been battling severe drought.</p>
      <p>A water-bombing plane accompanied by water-dropping helicopters continued to battle the fires near Port Macquarie on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The fire "has just gone straight through (the koala habitat) and very little would actually survive in there unscathed," firefighter Terry Hill told AFP.</p>
      <p>"Wallabies, kangaroo, deer - would get out because they can run. But koalas just really can't," he added.</p>
      <p>Rescuers are hoping to gain greater access to the devastated koala habitat tomorrow, where authorities say the fire is being brought under control.</p>
