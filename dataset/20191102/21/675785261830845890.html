      <h1>Tory two child benefit limit 'will put 266,000 more kids in poverty this year'</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE The cruel policy affects anyone but the super rich, the chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions committee says</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T21:18:13+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 21:18</time> by <a rel="author">Nigel Nelson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nigel-nelson/</a></address>
      <p>MPs will today tell Tories to lift their cruel two-child benefit limit because it’s creating more poor families.</p>
      <p>The Commons Work and Pensions committee heard evidence that the system will throw 266,000 extra children into poverty this year.</p>
      <p>And another 256,000 children already living below the breadline will sink even deeper into deprivation.</p>
      <p>Josephine Tucker of the Child Poverty Action Group, told MPs: “You could not design a policy better to increase child poverty than this one.”</p>
      <p>Payments of tax credits, Housing Benefit or <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/what-universal-credit-benefit-explained-13390461">Universal Credit</a> have been restricted to two children since April 2017, which means parents are losing up to £2,780 a year for any more children they have.</p>

      <p>The committee says the Government argument that families claiming benefits should face the same financial choices about having children as those supporting themselves solely through work doesn’t stack up.</p>
      <p>That assumes third pregnancies are planned, which the evidence shows the majority are not.</p>
      <p>And those in working families could lose their job, fall ill or become disabled.</p>
      <p>Chairman Frank Field said: “Any family except the super-rich could fall foul of the two-child limit if their circumstances changed.</p>
      <p>That’s why social security must act as a national insurance scheme covering people when they’re most exposed to hardship and not increase it.”</p>
      <p>The report says the effects of the two-child policy is felt more severely <br/>in communities in which families tend to be larger.</p>
      <p>MPs heard evidence that Muslim andJewish communities, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Gypsy, Roma and ­Traveller communities, and families in Northern Ireland are all disproportionately affected.</p>
