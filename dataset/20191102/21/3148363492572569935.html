      <h1>Watch: Former Anti-2A Activist Stands Up for Gun Owners</h1>

      <p>Gross spent years as the president of the Brady Campaign, but he told pro-gun rally attendees that he is sick of seeing gun owners maligned.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://jwp.io/s/kauPbCCc">said</a>, “I’m here because I’ve seen how all of you, decent, responsible, law-abiding gun owners, are relentlessly, and, I believe, unfairly, demonized.”</p>
      <p>Gross added, “I’ve seen firsthand how an ideological hatred of guns and the people who own them is more important to some people than the actual goal of saving lives.”</p>

      <p>Gross observed, “There is nothing that pisses me off than people who pretend they care about saving lives but really have other agendas.”</p>
      <p>He added, “I can tell, when I was leading Brady, I had a lot of issues with a lot of people who thought they were on my side.”</p>
      <p>Gross also <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/02/watch-live-activists-hold-second-amendment-rally-on-capitol-hill/?fbclid=IwAR2n94VKUILZPhZhfRKN4pB-QnE-ylFMytyB0EKZJ80B3DvEMXTJlYtrJ3k">discussed</a> what he thinks “gun owners can do to reclaim the narrative in this country.” He spoke of gun owners as “decent” people who lament tragedy just as non-gun owners do and suggested much of the gun debate can be settled via gun owners promoting firearm responsibility as passionately as they promote the right to own a firearm.</p>
