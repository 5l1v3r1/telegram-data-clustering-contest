      <h1>Strictly's Mike Bushell nearly drops partner Katya Jones during Charleston</h1>
      <h2>Mike and Katya earned their highest score in the show so far, but fans noticed that Mike very nearly dropped his dance partner</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T21:02:29+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 21:02</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p>Eagle-eyed Strictly Come Dancing fans noticed that dance off-regular Mike Bushell very nearly dropped his pro partner Katya Jones.</p>
      <p>The pair, who have survived being in the bottom two a whopping three times, impressed judges with their Charleston to Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines by The Ron Goodwin Orchestra.</p>
      <p>Stepping out of two model hot air balloons, they took to the floor with excitement and flair.</p>
      <p>Even the most passionate dancers can slip up though, as Mike proved when he nearly lost his grip on poor Katya.</p>
      <p>Still, they won an impressive 30 points, their highest score on the show so far.</p>

      <p>Mike will be hoping to avoid the a fourth dance off - and his third in a row - but he's got some stiff competition.</p>
      <p>Karim Zeroual and Amy Dowden, and Michelle Visage and Giovanni Pernice made for a stunning opening, scoring very highly and even drawing gushing praise from savagely harsh Craig Revel-Horwood.</p>
      <p>Last week saw the controversial axing of Corrie's Catherine Tyldesley - evicted after a dance off with Mike - which many fans were outraged about.</p>

      <p>DJ Dev Griffin was given the boot the week before, with Craig Revel-Horwood now admitting that the quality is better after several of the couples have been sent packing.</p>
      <p>He told Amanda Holden and Jamie Theakston on Heart's Breakfast Show: "You know generally when you get down to this stage because people are very equal in talent and ability, you know?</p>
      <p>"At the moment I think on Strictly it's becoming obvious that there are people that are really becoming fantastic and they're leaving some of the rest behind so it's quite split in that way.</p>
      <p>"But we do always get the dilemma of two good ones being in the bottom two."</p>
