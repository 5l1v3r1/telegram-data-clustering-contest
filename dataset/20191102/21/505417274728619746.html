        <b>Katie Taylor is a two-weight world champion.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Bray boxer achieved the feat with victory over Christina Linardatou in Manchester on Saturday night. After already cementing her legacy as the undisputed lightweight world champion, Taylor added the WBO super lightweight title to her impressive collection.</p>
      <p>The 2012 Olympic champion recorded her win via unanimous decision after a typically composed performance. Her professional record now reads 15-0.</p>

      <p>Taylor had the spectators at the Manchester Arena on their feet before the first bell rang.</p>

      <p>Linardatou took the fight to her, catching Katie with a swift right hand within the opening minute. After a slow start, the Irish boxer grew into proceedings and landed some telling shots to arguably win the second round. After a close call against Delfine Persoon last time out, Taylor boxed smart against her Greek opponent on Saturday evening, making Linardatou move around the ring as she picked her punches.</p>
      <p>The trend continued through the early rounds, with Taylor appearing to take control of the fight in round six, making her opponent swing and miss on several occasions. Linardatou cut a frustrated figure and had little answer to Katie’s combination punching and intelligent movement.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old Irish fighter was all class and rarely allowed herself to be drawn into a brawl.</p>

      <p>Linardatou was aggressive and unrelenting. She never wilted and made Taylor work hard for the victory. But Katie’s class and discipline helped her win the day.</p>
      <p>Taylor made history. She’s now a world champion in two divisions, as well as an Olympic champion. Katie is only the third Irish boxer in history to become a two-weight world champion, after Steve Collins and Carl Frampton.</p>
