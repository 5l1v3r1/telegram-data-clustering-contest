      <p><b>PRESCOTT, Ariz.Â (AP)</b> - A boulder that mysteriously disappeared two weeks ago from a national forest in Arizona is back, and forest officials aren't asking any questions.</p>
      <p>Prescott National Forest officials said a forest employee on patrol Friday noticed that the 1-ton boulder dubbed "Wizard Rock" had been returned to a site along State Route 89 south of Prescott.</p>
      <p>The much-admired boulder is black with streaks of white quartz running through it.</p>
      <p>District Ranger Sarah Clawson said forest officials were thrilled that the rock was returned and "grateful that whoever took it was conscientious enough to give it back to the public"</p>
      <p>According to forest officials, it would have required heavy equipment to move the boulder.</p>
      <p>Permits are required to gather and remove most forest products, including rocks, plants and trees.</p>
