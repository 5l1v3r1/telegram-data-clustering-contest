      <p>Two motorists have been arrested in Naas, Co Kildare.</p>
      <p>During an overnight high visibility traffic operation by garda√≠ in Kildare, over 600 motorists were tested for driving while intoxicated.</p>
      <p>The two drivers were arrested on suspicion of driving while intoxicated - one for alcohol and one for drugs.</p>
      <p>One car was seized for no insurance, a taxi was impounded for dangerous defects and 15 other minor traffic offences were reported.</p>
