      <p>Officials from a California school district were left red-faced after students who dialled a suicide prevention hotline listed on their ID badges instead stumbled on a sex line.</p>
      <p>"I was just kind of flabbergasted. I was very surprised," parent Janene Lavelle told the local ABC station after her daughter, who attends middle school, alerted her to the mixup.</p>
      <p>Lavelle said the teen had dialled the number for kicks and was in disbelief when she got a sex hotline.</p>
      <p>"Someone who genuinely needs help like that, they shouldn't hear that kind of thing from what they thought was going to help them," the student was quoted as telling a local CBS affiliate.</p>
      <p>"They should fact-check that kind of thing."</p>
      <p>The suicide prevention number was in a directory of emergency lines and other resources on the back of badges for students at New Vista Middle School in Lancaster, a 90-minute drive north of downtown Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>However, because of a mistake with just one digit, a sex hotline number instead of the correct suicide prevention number was given to students.</p>
      <p>"Late yesterday we were made aware that the middle school student ID cards have the wrong phone number listed for the suicide hotline," the Lancaster Unified School district said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"The phone numbers have two digits transposed and this is a mistake. The number listed on the card is actually a sex line."</p>
      <p>School officials said they have collected all the old badges and planned to issue new ones - this time with the correct number.</p>
