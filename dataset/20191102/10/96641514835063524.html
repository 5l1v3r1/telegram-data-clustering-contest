      <h2>What does that do for Wear OS?</h2>

      <p>Hey, good morning! You look fabulous.</p>
      <p>Welcome to your weekend! On Friday, Google made a major acquisition to boost its wearable hardware, and Apple TV+ debuted to a lukewarm reception. We'll dig into those events, and review some news highlights from the last week like Fisker's 'Ocean' EV and Netflix's controversial variable speed feature.</p>

        <b>What can Fitbit do to help Wear OS?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/google-buys-fitbit/?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=morningafter">Google buys Fitbit for $2.1 billion</a>

      <p>The search and advertising giant will swallow up the wearable device company -- pending approval by shareholders and regulators -- <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/google-buys-fitbit/">making Fitbit a part of its hardware team</a>. According to FitBit CEO James Park, "Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster and make health even more accessible."</p>
      <p>Google VP Sameer Samat called the deal "exciting opportunity for Wear OS," suggesting that we'll see Fitbit-style hardware running Google's software in the future. What could that bring to the table for the platform formerly known as Android Wear? <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/02/fitbit-google-wearos/">We have a few ideas</a>.</p>

      <p>Apple's first star-laden TV shows have made their debut on streaming, and Devindra Hardawar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/apple-tv-review/">can excitedly report that they are... "fine."</a> The Apple TV app works smoothly, everything looks great, but despite being perfectly watchable, the first batch of original content fails to have a true standout in the bunch. Still, at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/apple-tv-plus-how-to-best-launch-deals/">$5 per month and free for a year to anyone who has recently purchased new Apple hardware</a>, it doesn't have to be perfect -- at least not yet.</p>

      <p>With the Pixel 4, Google went all-in on facial recognition. However, it hasn't yet added a trigger that requires the user to have their eyes open before it unlocks the phone. Having a device that will unlock while you're asleep or uncooperative is a more significant security risk than you might think, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/google-s-pixel-4-face-unlock-fiasco/">as Violet Blue explains</a>, that's just one of the problems worth considering.</p>

      <p>Blizzard's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/blizzcon2019">big event</a> is taking place this weekend, and it opened the show with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/blizzcon-2019-hong-kong/">an attempt at an apology</a> by president J.

      <p>The latest update to iOS 13 is here, and it adds the "computational photography" feature, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/28/ios-13-2-deep-fusion-photography-now-available/">Deep Fusion</a>, which is Apple's answer to Google and Night Sight. It takes advantage of machine learning and image stacking to render each pixel of a photo optimally. You'll likely see the benefits of Apple's new approach most in less-than-ideal lighting conditions, but it should help to improve all your photos. The update also adds 70-or-so new emoji, and if you have a HomePod, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/28/homepod-multi-user-update/">it's ready to recognize voices for multiple people</a> in the home and handle audio Handoffs with iPhones.</p>
