      <h1>Analyst PlanB: Weak Dollar Can Upend Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Model</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T10:58:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 10:58</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>The creator of the highly popular Stock-to-Flow model for forecasting the Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) price says he would be happy if it stays valid for the next 12 years.</p>
      <h3>PlanB: Stock-to-Flow not until 2140</h3>
      <p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1190036545476157440">Twitter exchange</a> beginning on Nov. 1, the account known as PlanB said the tool, which has proven to be <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-bitcoin-stock-to-flow-chart-shows-bearish-periods-precede-halvings">extremely accurate</a>, was not designed to last forever. </p>
      <p>“I normally don't deploy statistical models 120+ years out into the future. I would be happy if the model holds for 1 or 2 or maybe 3 more halvings,” he wrote. </p>
      <p>Stock-to-Flow measures Bitcoin price using the existing available supply — the stock — and the number of new Bitcoin units entering circulation — the flow. </p>
      <p>Bitcoin’s flow halves roughly every four years in what is called a block reward halving. Each event decreases the amount of Bitcoin paid to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-mining">miners</a> for finding a new block. </p>
      <p>BTC/USD has entered a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-bitcoin-stock-to-flow-chart-shows-bearish-periods-precede-halvings">bullish phase</a> in the period following both halvings it has seen so far.</p>
      <h3>“Everything else’s value is decreasing”</h3>
      <p>As an asset with a high stock-to-flow ratio, Bitcoin ranks with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/gold">gold</a> as the antithesis to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/fiat-money">fiat currency</a>, which can have its flow dramatically increased relative to its stock. This quality has led many to describe Bitcoin as “digital gold.”</p>
      <p>As such, PlanB agreed, the model may one day no longer be able to take into account the weakness of the dollar if its stock-to-flow ratio drops even more. Specifically, this concerns the status quo at the end of Bitcoin’s mining period in 2140.</p>
      <p>He agreed with the idea that it is not Bitcoin’s value increasing, but rather that “everything else’s value is decreasing.”</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-8k-bounce-now-aligns-perfectly-with-stock-to-flow-chart">reported</a>, Stock-to-Flow calls for Bitcoin to retain an average price of around $8,200 before its next halving event in May 2020. </p>
      <p>Thereafter, the model calls for a dramatic bull run, with a price of $100,000 by around the end of 2021. PlanB reconfirmed his belief in this eventuality in an <a href="https://twitter.com/realvision/status/1185308575595466757">interview</a> last month.</p>
