      <p>Former <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pakistan">Pakistan </a>prime minister Nawaz Sharif's health condition remains critical as his platelet count has dropped again, a day after it rose to 51,000, his personal physician said on Saturday. Sharif, 69, was admitted to the Services Hospital on Monday night from Pakistan's anti-graft body's custody after his platelets dropped to a critical low level of 2,000.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pakistan">Pakistan </a>Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo's platelets increased from 35,000 to 51,000, showing improvement in his condition.</p>
      <p>"Former PM <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nawaz-sharif">Nawaz Sharif </a>remains critical. The treating doctors tried to reduce the Steroids dose being given to him but unfortunately resulted in drop in Platelet count again yesterday," said Adnan Khan.</p>
      <p>The doctor said the cause behind the drop in platelets needs to be diagnosed and established without delay, Geo News reported.</p>
      <p>"A very delicate balance has to be maintained between coagulation and anti-coagulation to sustain fragile unstable health status," Khan said.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the doctor had tweeted saying that the former prime minister's health was in a critical condition and he was fighting a battle for survival. The Islamabad High Court on Tuesday suspended Sharif's sentence for eight weeks in a corruption case, paving way for his release on medical grounds.</p>

      <p>He had already secured bail from the Lahore High Court in the money laundering case linked to the Chaudhry Sugar Mills. Regarding shifting Sharif to London for better treatment, PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal told <i>PTI </i>on Wednesday that the first and foremost effort of doctors is to stabilise his condition.</p>
      <p>"Once his condition is stabilised, the question of his going abroad will arise and be decided," Iqbal said.</p>
      <p>Another PML-N leader and former foreign minister Khwaja Asif said Sharif will decide on his own whether he wants to be treated abroad or not, the report said.</p>
      <p>On December 24, 2018, an accountability court had sentenced Sharif to seven years in prison in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills corruption case and acquitted him in the Flagship case.</p>
      <p>In a short verdict announced, the court said there was concrete evidence against the former premier in the Al-Azizia case and that he was unable to provide a money trail in the case.</p>
