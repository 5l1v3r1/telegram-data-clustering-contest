      <p>While Hoodrich Pablo Juan has been prolific since he stepped on the scene, 2018 was a slower year for him. For an artist accustomed to dropping a handful of projects in a 12-month period, him dropping only two last year seemed out of character. However, he assured <i><a href="https://www.thefader.com/2019/03/22/hoodrich-pablo-juan-interview-new-mixtape-blo">FADER</a></i> in an interview that this reduced output wasn't due to any slacking in his work ethic. "Let's just say that I made more music in 2018 than I did in 2017," the Decatur rapper said. "Why I didn't drop it is different, because the circumstances changed. It was a transition. In 2019 I'm dropping more tapes."</p>
      <p>Hoodrich was not lying. <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/hoodrich-pablo-juan-drops-off-blo-the-movie-ft-gucci-mane-young-thug-and-more-new-mixtape.119094.html">After dropping <i>BLO: The Movie</i> mixtape in May</a>, he is back with another strong full-length titled <i>DMV (Dope Money</i> Violence). Unlike <i>BLO</i>, which was loaded with features from fellow Atlanta trappers, <i>DMV</i> only enlists guests for two of its fifteen songs. While HPJ brings in the head of his label, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/guccimane/profile">Gucci Mane</a>, and <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/WizKhalifa/profile">Wiz Khalifa</a> for a strong collaborative track, he certainly doesn't struggle to toe the line on his own. Hoodrich's bassy drawl smoothly swims through songs, always resulting in a charismatic product. <i>DMV </i>is taken to the next level by having its beats provided by heavyweight producers like Tay Keith, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/zaytoven/profile">Zaytoven</a>, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/southside/profile">Southside</a>, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tm88/profile">TM88</a>, Ronny J and Maaly Raw.</p>
