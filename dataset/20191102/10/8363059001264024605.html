      <h1>French Students Will Now Have to Learn About Bitcoin</h1>

      <p>High school students in France may be among the first people in the world to actually understand how cryptocurrency works.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/11/01/french-kids-will-now-learn-about-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-at-school-cest-woke/">The Next Web</a> reports that the French education ministry, Le Ministère de l’Éducation Nationale, will integrate cryptocurrency into its curriculum and teach students the influence that bitcoin has on the economy. An <a href="https://cache.media.eduscol.education.fr/file/SES/96/5/RA19_Lycee_G_SPE_SES_1ere_monnaie-ses_1172965.pdf">outline of the curriculum</a> notes that under this new module, high school teachers will provide a basic overview of cryptocurrency so students can understand the framework of decentralised financial systems.</p>
      <p>France announced the decision in June, but cryptocurrency <a href="https://decrypt.co/10983/french-high-schools-to-teach-students-about-bitcoin">reporters</a> in the U.S. and <a href="https://bitcoin.fr/bitcoin-au-programme-du-lycee/">France</a> have <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-officially-included-in-french-high-school-syllabus-to-explain-money-and-trust/">learned</a> of the new curriculum this week.</p>
      <p>The education ministry recommends teachers use four educational videos that address questions like “Is Bitcoin the currency of the future?” and “Can Bitcoin replace the Euro?”</p>
      <p>According to the cryptocurrency outlet <a href="https://decrypt.co/10983/french-high-schools-to-teach-students-about-bitcoin">Decrypt</a>, the curriculum outline advises that students should watch the videos and discuss the differences between fiat money (like the pound coins in your wallet) and bitcoin.</p>
      <p>This is far from the first time academic institutions will be encouraged to teach students about cryptocurrency. A recent Coinbase report found that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-42-of-worlds-best-universities-offer-crypto-courses/">42 per cent of top universities</a> feature blockchain and cryptocurrency course. But France’s new suggested curriculum is likely the first nationwide programme that encourages blockchain studies.</p>
      <p>No matter how you feel about cryptocurrency, encouraging young students to understand financial systems can only benefit them and the future economy. If recent generations of students had a healthy balance of STEM and economics in their curriculum, we wouldn’t be as screwed as we are now.</p>
