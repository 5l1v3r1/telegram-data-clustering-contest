      <h1>Overwatch 1 Will Get Basically Everything From Overwatch 2, Minus The PvE</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T10:07:26+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 10:07</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Walker</a></address>
      <p>Wondering what a <i>Overwatch</i> sequel means to players of the existing game? Blizzard asked themselves the same question, and the answer is to make sure so much content is shared with existing players, that you might not need to buy <i>Overwatch 2</i> at all.</p>
      <p>A key concern for the <i>Overwatch</i> community is what would happen to the hundreds of hours they've spent levelling up, unlocking skins, emotes and various cosmetics. The good news is all of that will carry over into <i>Overwatch 2</i>.</p>
      <p>But if you don't buy <i>Overwatch 2</i>, you won't be left out. Telling the Blizzcon crowd that they wanted to change the idea of what a sequel was, Jeff Kaplan announced that <i>Overwatch 1</i> players would be able to play in the same games as <i>Overwatch 2</i> players, on the same maps with the same heroes.</p>

      <p>The official website, updated after the announcement, reaffirmed that:</p>
      <blockquote>Your accomplishments and loot collections will be carried forward to <i>Overwatch 2</i>. That means you’ll keep your skins, player icons, sprays, emotes, and more! Current <i>Overwatch</i> players will battle side-by-side with <i>Overwatch 2</i> players in PvP multiplayer; they’ll also be able to play Overwatch 2 heroes and maps.</blockquote>
      <p>What existing <i>Overwatch</i> players won't get is the PvE content, which means the story missions and hero missions featuring Overwatch's efforts to battle back the Null Sec invasion. It's not known whether the new graphical look for <i>Overwatch 2</i> will be available in the existing game, but more info is expected to be announced soon.</p>
