      <p>What's next for Azeroth? As it turns out, Sylvanas needs an army.</p>
      <p>The undead leader and former Warchief of the Horde was the centrepiece of the major Blizzcon 2019 reveal, squaring off against the Lich King. <i>Shadowlands</i>, the new expansion, has dispensed with the Lich King for the first time in <i>WoW</i>'s history.</p>
      <p>In practical terms, that means the afterlife is now the new zone for players to explore in modern <i>WoW</i>. The realm is the home of the power for Death Knights and many of the spirits in the world of Azeroth. Players will choose a covenant, according to a gameplay reveal, and the expansion will release sometime in 2020.</p>
