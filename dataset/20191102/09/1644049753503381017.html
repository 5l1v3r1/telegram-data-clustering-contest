      <p>Malaysia rejected a compensation offer of “less than $2 billion” from Goldman Sachs for the role of its subsidiaries in the multi-billion-dollar 1MDB scandal, an aide to the country’s prime minister said Saturday.</p>
      <p>Huge sums were stolen from Malaysian state fund 1MDB in a fraud allegedly involving former prime minister Najib Razak and his cronies, and spent on everything from high-end real estate to a luxury super-yacht.</p>
      <p>Goldman’s role has been under scrutiny as it helped arrange bond issues worth billions for 1MDB, with Malaysia claiming large amounts were misappropriated in the process and seeking $7.5 billion in redress.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who reopened an investigation into the scandal after seizing power last year, told the Financial Times his government spurned a much smaller offer by the Wall Street titan.</p>
      <p>“Goldman Sachs has offered something like less than $2 billion,” he said in a Friday interview with the newspaper.</p>
      <p>“We are not satisfied with that amount so we are still talking to them… If they respond reasonably we might not insist on getting that $7.5 billion,” he added, without providing further details.</p>
      <p>A staff member travelling with Mahathir, who is currently in Bangkok, confirmed the premier’s remarks to AFP on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Last year, Malaysia filed charges against three units of the bank and two ex-employees over the scandal.</p>
      <p>Additional charges were filed in August against 17 current and former executives of the three Goldman subsidiaries, which the Wall Street titan later said were “misdirected”.</p>
      <p>The news comes days after US officials said that Low Taek Jho, a central figure in the scandal, agreed to forfeit $700 million in assets as part of efforts to recover the stolen money.</p>
      <p>Mahathir said this week Malaysia would ask America to hand over what it has recovered from Low, in what is the largest ever US civil forfeiture.</p>
