      <p>Kyle Sinckler suffered Rugby World Cup heartbreak when the biggest match of his life was ended after just two minutes in Japan.</p>
      <p>England’s tighthead prop had been one of the stars of the tournament and had won a fitness race to be fit for the final.</p>
      <p>But he came to grief before the game had even properly got going - colliding with the elbow of Red Rose teammate Maro Itoje as they attempted to tackle South Africa wing Makazole Mapimpi.</p>
      <p>Gary Lineker sympathised with the rugby star, tweeting: "What a shame for Kyle Sinckler. To go off so early in a World Cup final must be heartbreaking."</p>

      <p>It capped an unconvincing start by Eddie Jones’ men who have been taken aback by the ferocity of the Springboks’ opening.</p>
      <p>Handre Pollard kicked them into the lead on 10 minutes as Dan Cole came on to replace Sinckler.</p>
      <p>Cole must play 77 minutes at tighthead if England are not to have to deploy loosehead Joe Marler out of position in the later stages.</p>

      <p>Sinckler, one of the stars of this tournament, suffered a calf injury in the semi-final win over New Zealand and has not trained fully so far this week.</p>
      <p>But he had been passed fit to start against South Africa in Yokohama in what is Jones' 50th game in charge.</p>
      <p>England have lost only nine of those games and are favourites to beat the Springboks and reclaim a title they last won in 2003.</p>
