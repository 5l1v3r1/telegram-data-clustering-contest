      <p>You may not necessarily have heard of ‘<a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/gaming-box">Gaming Boxes</a>‘ and that’s not any criticism of your technological knowledge either. They are still something of a fringe product in the tech world but can open up some surprisingly strong potential to people who need graphical performance on the go. The latest release by <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/gigabyte">Gigabyte</a>, however, is certainly a very interesting proposition.</p>
      <p>In a report <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/gigabyte-launches-aorus-gaming-box-with-rtx-2080-ti">via Videocardz</a>, Gigabyte has revealed their Aorus 2080 Ti Gaming Box. The worlds-first portable graphics solution that has water-cooling!</p>

      <h3>Gigabyte Aorus 2080 Ti Gaming Box</h3>
      <p>The product, as per Gaming Box designs, allows people to have a portable graphics solution that essentially makes the <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/graphics-card">graphics card</a> contained within interchangeable and adaptable between various systems. Let’s say, for example, you regularly use both a laptop and desktop system but don’t necessarily want to spend the money on a high-end graphics solution for each of them. A Gaming Box acts as a ‘plug-in and play’ portable solution meaning that you can literally carry it around and use it on whatever system you like. Clever stuff, right?</p>

      <p>With this release from Gigabyte containing an Nvidia 2080 Ti, you already should know that this has some amazingly strong graphical arms. When you consider, however, that this also has a water-cooled solution, however, the first incidentally of its type incidentally, it really is pretty amazing.</p>
      <p>This is, without a doubt, about as good as it gets in the ‘Gaming Box’ world.</p>

      <h3>When is it Out and How Much Will it Cost?</h3>
      <p>Sadly, despite revealing the product, Gigabyte has confirmed neither the release date nor the price for their Auros Gaming Box. All that is known is that (perhaps disappointingly) despite the water-cooling offered, the graphics card within hasn’t been overclocked. Given that this is such a powerful graphics card, however, that shouldn’t be too much of a problem.</p>
      <p>The thing to bear in mind though is that as this is targeting a very niché market. As such, you shouldn’t expect this to be cheap!</p>
      <p>Given that a standard 2080 Ti costs you around £1000, expect this to be at least 30-50% more expensive. If you do, however, regularly skip between desktops and laptops then this may (perhaps surprisingly) represent some excellent value!</p>
      <p>What do you think? Are you impressed with the design and specifications? Would you consider getting a ‘Gaming Box’? – Let us know in the comments!</p>
