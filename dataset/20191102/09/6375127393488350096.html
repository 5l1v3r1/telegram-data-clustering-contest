      <h3>LAS VEGAS (AFP) - Canelo Alvarez bids to add another chapter to his legacy on Saturday when he steps up two divisions to face WBO light-heavyweight champion Sergey “Krusher” Kovalev in Las Vegas.</h3>
      <p>The 29-year-old Mexican middleweight king (52-1-2, 35 KOs) is regarded as the betting favourite for what is set to be a clash of youth and speed against Kovalev’s experience and raw punching power.</p>
      <p>Alvarez is fighting for the first time since a unanimous decision over Daniel Jacobs in May while Kovalev successfully defended his belt with an 11th round knockout of Britain’s Anthony Yarde in Russia in August.</p>
      <p>Although Alvarez has fought at multiple weight divisions, he has never before fought beyond the super-middleweight limit, where he battered Britain’s Rocky Fielding into submission inside three rounds last year.</p>
      <p>Kovalev (34-3-1, 29 KOs) is likely to prove a tougher nut to crack.</p>
      <p>Even allowing for the fact that the 36-year-old has shown clear signs of ageing in some of his recent outings, the Russian remains a heavy-handed threat.</p>
      <p>“He’s the best in his division, he’s one of the best, that’s why we chose him, to make history by fighting one of the best,” Alvarez said this week.</p>
      <p>“I feel comfortable, I feel good, we’ll see on Saturday how it all goes but I feel good. I trust my endurance, my strength.”</p>
      <p>Although Alvarez has already shown his ability to absorb punishment, most notably in his two bruising battles with Gennady Golovkin, Kovalev’s power could cause him problems.</p>
      <p>Kovalev meanwhile sees his fight with Alvarez as an opportunity to resurrect his career in the eyes of the boxing world.</p>
      <p>The Russian lost his WBA, IBF and WBO belts in back-to-back defeats to Andre Ward in 2016 and 2017, but regained a share of the title after beating Colombia’s Eleider Alvarez in a rematch in February.</p>
      <p>“I’m happy,” Kovalev said. “It’s nice that this is the biggest call in my boxing career, and to face Canelo, I’m happy.</p>
