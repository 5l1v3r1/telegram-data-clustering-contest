      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>Former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi visited Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) hospital on Saturday for a brief medical check-up after he complained about experiencing hernia pain.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the medical board recommended a hernia surgery for the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader, but the former premier was not ready to be operated at PIMS.</p>
      <p>During his medical examination, the doctors performed an electrocardiogram (ECG) to determine his condition.</p>
      <p>After the medical examination, the former premier left the hospital.</p>

      <p>A medical board on Monday suggested shifting the former prime minister, who is currently incarcerated in the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) scandal, from Adalia jail to a hospital after his health deteriorated.</p>
      <p>During Abbasi’s appearance before the accountability court on Monday, the political leader’s counsel submitted a plea praying upon the court to broadcast the LNG scandal trial on television.</p>
      <p>The former premier also moved a petition in the accountability court seeking permission to be treated at Al-Shifa Hospital on his expense.</p>
