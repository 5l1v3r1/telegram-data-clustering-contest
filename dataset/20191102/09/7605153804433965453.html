        <b>YOKOHAMA, Japan, Nov 2 – England captain Owen Farrell blamed a sluggish start as his team crashed to a 20-point defeat to South Africa in the Rugby World Cup final on Saturday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“We didn’t start it well. Probably had a disappointing first half,” said Farrell, who looked close to tears after the 32-12 loss.</p>
      <p>He added that the team had shown good fight in the second half and was “massively proud” to lead England to the World Cup final.</p>
      <p>“But credit to South Africa. They were very good today,” said Farrell, who kicked all 12 of England’s points.</p>
      <p>Coach Eddie Jones said England, who stunned defending champions New Zealand a week ago, were unable to make headway against heavyweight South Africa.</p>
      <p>“We just struggled to get in the game. The effort of the players was outstanding but we just struggled to get on the front foot today,” said the Australian.</p>
      <p>South Africa fly-half Handre Pollard did the damage with six penalty kicks before wings Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe punished England with two late tries.</p>
      <p>“I can’t fault the preparation of the players. They’ve worked hard the entire World Cup and I think they played with a lot of pride and passion,” said Jones.</p>
      <p>“We just weren’t good enough today and congratulations to South Africa for an outstanding performance.”</p>
