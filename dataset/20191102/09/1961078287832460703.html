      <h1>Beto Is Out and Warren’s Way to Pay: This Week in the 2020 Race</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T09:00:08+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Maggie Astor and Matt Stevens</a></address>
      <p>For one day this week, the 2020 Democratic primary included “Gory BOOker,” “Steve BOO-lock” and “BoOOLián Castro.” How’s that for Halloween spirit?</p>
      <p>We’ll return to the holiday later. For now, here’s a look at the more substantive things that happened in the race this week.</p>
      <h3>Beto O’Rourke is out</h3>
      <p>Former Representative <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/beto-orourke.html?module=inline">Beto O’Rourke</a> of Texas ended his presidential campaign on Friday, saying he had concluded that “this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully.”</p>
      <p>“My service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee,” he said in <a href="https://medium.com/@BetoORourke/thank-you-b13458279468">a message to supporters</a>. “Acknowledging this now is in the best interests of those in the campaign; it is in the best interests of this party as we seek to unify around a nominee; and it is in the best interests of the country.”</p>
      <p>Mr. O’Rourke began his campaign as a potential front-runner, with some polls early in the year showing him as high as third place. But his numbers have steadily sunk, and by this month he was polling mostly at 2 percent or less.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Our colleague Alex Burns has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/us/politics/beto-orourke-drops-out.html">the full story</a> on Mr. O’Rourke’s decision.</li>
        <li>Seventeen candidates are still running. We’re <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/2020-presidential-candidates.html">tracking the field here</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Warren’s plan to pay for ‘Medicare for all’</h3>
      <p>Senator <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html?module=inline">Elizabeth Warren</a> of Massachusetts laid out <a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/paying-for-m4a?source=soc-WB-ew-tw-rollout-20191101">how to pay for her “Medicare for all” plan</a> on Friday, proposing $20.5 trillion in new spending through significant tax increases on businesses and wealthy Americans, but not, she said, on the middle class.</p>
      <p>Under Ms. Warren’s plan, employer-sponsored health insurance would be eliminated and replaced by free government coverage for all Americans. Like Senator <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html?module=inline">Bernie Sanders</a> of Vermont, she would essentially eliminate medical costs for individuals, including premiums, deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses.</p>
      <p>To fund it, she said that over the next decade, she would require employers to pay trillions of dollars, create a tax on financial transactions like stock trades, change how investment gains are taxed for the top 1 percent of households, and increase her signature wealth tax proposal for billionaires. She also proposed cutting $800 billion in military spending.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can read more about Ms. Warren’s plan, and its implications for her and the rest of the field, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-medicare-for-all.html">here</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Kamala Harris is cutting her staff</h3>
      <p>Senator <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/kamala-harris.html?module=inline">Kamala Harris</a> of California, once in the top tier of the Democratic field, has fallen as low as 3 percent in recent polls. And on Wednesday, her campaign announced that it would lay off some aides, reduce top staffers’ pay and throw its full weight into Iowa.</p>
      <p>In a memo to staff members, Ms. Harris’s campaign manager, Juan Rodriguez, said the layoffs and pay reductions would free up enough money for more than $1 million in advertising.</p>
      <p>Mr. Rodriguez also took a thinly veiled jab at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/julian-castro.html?module=inline">Julián Castro</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/cory-booker.html?module=inline">Cory Booker</a>, who raised money by telling supporters they would drop out otherwise. A successful campaign, he wrote, must “make difficult strategic decisions and make clear priorities, not threaten to drop out or deploy gimmicks.”</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Our colleague Astead W. Herndon has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/us/politics/kamala-harris-campaign.html">more details here</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Castro out of danger — for now</h3>
      <p>About that fund-raising effort from Mr. Castro, the former housing secretary: As we mentioned last week, he had announced that he would end his campaign if he didn’t raise $800,000 by Oct. 31.</p>
      <p>Well, Oct. 31 was Thursday, and (surprise!) Mr. Castro’s team announced Friday that <a href="https://twitter.com/JulianCastro/status/1190262975157940225">he made it</a>.</p>
      <p>“We’re not going anywhere,” his campaign manager, Maya Rupert, said in a statement. “Julián will keep being a voice for the voiceless, and a champion for the Americans who have been left behind.”</p>
      <h3>A tight race in Iowa</h3>
      <p>Four Democratic presidential candidates are locked in a close race in Iowa, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers released on Friday.</p>
      <p>The survey puts Ms. Warren (22 percent) slightly ahead of Mr. Sanders (19 percent), Mayor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/pete-buttigieg.html?module=inline">Pete Buttigieg</a> of South Bend, Ind. (18 percent), and former Vice President <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html?module=inline">Joseph R. Biden Jr.</a> (17 percent).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/us/politics/iowa-poll-warren-biden.html">read more about the new Iowa poll here</a>.</li>
        <li>In New Hampshire, <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/10/29/.top2_nh.pdf">a new CNN poll</a> showed Mr. Sanders in the lead with 21 percent, just ahead of Ms. Warren (18 percent) and Mr. Biden (15 percent).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>In policy news …</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/tom-steyer.html">Tom Steyer</a> released <a href="https://www.tomsteyer.com/partnerships-with-rural-communities/">a plan for </a><a href="https://www.tomsteyer.com/partnerships-with-rural-communities/">rural communities</a> that would invest hundreds of billions of dollars in modernizing energy infrastructure, expanding broadband, fighting climate change and more.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana introduced a <a href="https://stevebullock.com/womens-equality/">women’s rights plan</a>, including measures aimed at closing gender pay gap, restoring Title IX standards and codifying Roe v. Wade.</p>
          <p>Mr. Bullock also released <a href="https://stevebullock.com/accessibility/">a plan for people with disabilities</a>. Among other things, it would create a “National Office of Disability Coordination” and bar companies from paying people with disabilities less than minimum wage.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>And finally …</h3>
      <p>We’ve got a few Halloween treats for you this weekend.</p>
      <p>First off, we like polls, and Monmouth University, one of the most highly respected polling groups out there, gave us this <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_us_101019.pdf/">very serious survey</a> on how Americans feel about Halloween. One takeaway: 36 percent of Americans picked Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups as their favorite candy, making it the clear leader.</p>
      <p>Mr. Buttigieg, Ms. Harris, Mr. O’Rourke and Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado were among the candidates who picked it as their favorite in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/opinion/2020-candidates-halloween-candy.html?module=inline">a survey done by our colleagues in Opinion</a>.</p>
      <p>They were also asked to name the worst candy. The entrepreneur <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/andrew-yang.html?module=inline">Andrew Yang</a> expressed his distaste for candy corn and offered the following observation: “There are better candies and better corn.”</p>
      <p>Finally, we leave you with <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1190083325609816065">this video from Ms. Warren</a>, whose dog, Bailey, channeled his inner tax policy wonk this year, <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamWarren/status/1190071526504222720">appearing as his mom’s two-cent wealth tax</a>.</p>
