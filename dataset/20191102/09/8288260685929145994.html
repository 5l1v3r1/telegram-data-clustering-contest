      <p>The Rugby World Cup final saw worrying scenes emerge just minutes into the clash  between England and South Africa today.</p>
      <p>Fans flocked to social media to send their well-wishes to Kyle Sinckler after the England star was knocked unconscious.</p>
      <p>The English prop went in for a tackle inside the opening 120 seconds of the clash in Japan.</p>
      <p>But Sinckler, who went to tackle with Maro Itoje, was left felled by the attempt to stop Springbok Makazole Mapimpi.</p>
      <p>The England prop went down inside just two minutes into the game in Yokohama.</p>
      <p>He was left injured after Itoje's arm swung round and collided with him.</p>

      <p>Sinckler, a Harlequins star, dropped to the floor and lay motionless on the ground as several medics rushed to his aid, resulting in the game being halted for several minutes.</p>
      <p>As concerned teammates stood around waiting for an update, TV commentators explained that physios were explaining to Sinckler that he had been knocked out.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>As he moved his legs and came around, this was greeted with cheers by tens of thousands of fans inside the stadium, who applauded when he sat up on the pitch.</p>
      <p>After a few minutes down, he managed to walk off the pitch himself, with a permanent England change then made when Dan Coles coming on in the front row.</p>
      <p>Gary Lineker sympathised with the rugby star, tweeting: "What a shame for Kyle Sinckler. To go off so early in a World Cup final must be heartbreaking."</p>
      <p>It capped an unconvincing start by Eddie Jones’ men who have been taken aback by the ferocity of the Springboks’ opening.</p>
      <p>Handre Pollard kicked them into the lead on 10 minutes as Dan Cole came on to replace Sinckler.</p>
