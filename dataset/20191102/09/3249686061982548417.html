I think we have to rest. I have a feeling that we'll all be laying down for a week after our schedule is over." </i><b>JeA</b> added, <i>"We still have some of our idol schedule left. We have to do a fan sign event. We're already taking omega 3."<br/><br/></i>Have you seen Brown Eyed Girls' <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/video/2019/10/brown-eyed-girls-make-grand-return-with-visually-striking-mvs-for-wonder-woman-and-abandoned">music videos</a> for "<b>Wonder Woman</b>" and "<b>Abandoned</b>"?</p>
