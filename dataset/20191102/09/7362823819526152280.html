      <p>A dispute between an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/indiana">Indiana</a> mayor and his city’s <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">police department</a> has resulted in a list of felony charges against the mayor, according to reports.</p>

      <p>The dispute with the police department began after the recent arrest of Meer’s stepson on drug charges – an arrest that Meer claims was politically motivated, South Bend’s WNDU-TV reported.</p>

      <p>Shortly after police Chief Mark Swistek and two assistant chiefs resigned, with Swistek alleging the mayor had ordered him to pull an unspecified number of officers out of the department’s anti-drug task force. A new police chief was named Tuesday.</p>
      <p>After Meer was charged, the judge assigned to his case recused himself because his wife works as corporate council for the city.</p>
