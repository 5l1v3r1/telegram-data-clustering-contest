      <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ant-man-3-peyton-reed-returning-direct-1251732"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a> reports that Reed has signed on to helm <i>Ant-Man 3</i>, but the movie currently has no confirmed release date.</p>
      <p>The movie’s plot details have not yet been shared, however Paul Rudd is expected to return as Scott Lang – it will be his fifth outing as the character.</p>
      <p>Reed joined the MCU when he replaced Edgar Wright to helm the first <i>Ant-Man</i> movie. He is also known for directing the movies <i>The Break-Up</i> and <i>Bring It On</i>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/paul-rudd-martin-scorsese-ant-man-2556880">MCU stalwart Paul Rudd has responded to Martin Scorsese’s recent comments that Marvel movies “are not cinema”</a> in an interview with <i>NME</i>.</p>
      <p>The legendary filmmaker made headlines earlier this month when he made disparaging comments about Marvel’s run of comic book movies.</p>
      <p>“Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks,” <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/martin-scorsese-claims-marvel-movies-not-cinema-2554040">Scorsese said</a>. “It isn’t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.”</p>
      <p>When asked by <i>NME</i> what he makes of the acclaimed director’s recent statement, Rudd countered: “I love Martin Scorsese, I love his movies, I can’t wait to see <i>The Irishman</i>.”</p>
