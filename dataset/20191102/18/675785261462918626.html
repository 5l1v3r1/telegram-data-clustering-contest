      <h2>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was handed the Arsenal captaincy against Wolves after Granit Xhaka's outburst at Gunners fans last week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T18:35:14+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 18:35</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery has opened up the possibility of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang taking over the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> captaincy on a permanent basis.</p>
      <p>Gunners boss Emery is potentially on the look out for a new skipper after Granit Xhaka's x-rated on-field outburst during last weekend's draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> .</p>
      <p>Xhaka, who ripped his shirt off, cupped his ears and told fans to "f*** off" after a reaction to his substitution, was left out of Arsenal's clash with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Swiss midfielder could have the captaincy, which he was only given earlier this season, taken off him - although the decision hasn't been made yet.</p>

      <p>In his place, Aubameyang was handed the captain's armband for the draw at the Emirates Stadium - and led from the front as he scored the Gunners' opener with a classy finish.</p>
      <p>When asked whether the Gabon international will now become his first choice captain, Emery said: "He could be, I think he can take that responsibility and today he did that."</p>
      <p>Arsenal fans weren't 100 per cent in agreement that Aubameyang was the right person to lead the Gunners.</p>

      <p>But Robbie Savage reckons he is their best player and therefore can lead by example.</p>
      <p>"Arsenal fans were having a go at probably their best player in Aubameyang which was completely and utterly strange," Savage said on BT Sports.</p>
      <p>"It was not a surprise to see him as captain. I think he's their best player, their most influential player."</p>
      <p>Rio Ferdinand hit out at Emery for allowing the Gunners players to make the original decision on who to make captain.</p>
      <p>"The situation with the captaincy was something that I thought was very strange at the time it happened and the way its panned out has confirmed my queries," the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> legend told BT Sport.</p>
      <p>"Allowing the players to choose the captain… you’re the manager, you go in there and say ‘this is who I want as my captain he [Xhaka] is someone that actually is going to be a little bit of the mirror image of me [Emery] out on the pitch’.</p>
      <p>"Either as a character or the way he speaks and conducts himself etcetera but he’s allowing the players to choose the captain.</p>
      <p>"For far too long at this club there has been a lack of leadership on the pitch. There’s been a lack of characters."</p>
