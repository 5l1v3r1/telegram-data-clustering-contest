      </figure>
      <p>Ter Stegen 5 - Beaten three times in seven minutes, couldn’t be the hero</p>
      <p>Sergi Roberto 5 - Back at right-back, did OK at the back but didn’t offer anything going forward</p>
      <p>Gerard Pique 3 - After a decent first half he collapsed in the second half, imprecise and badly positioned</p>
      <p>Clement Lenglet 3 - Nervous and weak during the 90 mins, at fault for the third</p>
      <p>Nelson Semedo 6 - One of the few who did OK, earning the penalty for the opener</p>
      <p>Frenkie de Jong 5 - Could not take control of the game, this time featuring in Busquets’ role</p>
      <p>Arthur Melo 4 - Was not involved in the game and could even have been sent off in the first half</p>
      <p>Arturo Vidal 4 - The Chilean is a coin flip and this time it didn’t work - played without order</p>
      <p>Leo Messi 6 - Scored the first and then added another but it was ruled out because of Griezmann’s offside</p>
      <p>Luis Suarez 5 - Quiet until he was taken off injured</p>
      <p>Antoine Griezmann 4 - Tried hard but should offer more when it comes to determining the game</p>
