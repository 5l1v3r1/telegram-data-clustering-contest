      <h2>Arsenal 1-1 Wolverhampton Wanderers reaction | Raul Jimenez cancelled out Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's first half goal to rescue a point for his side in the Premier League clash</h2>

      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers fans were in raptures after Raul Jimenez reduced a point for his side at Arsenal on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Mexico international cancelled out Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 21st minute strike when he headed in Joao Moutinho's <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-player-ratings-neves-moutinho-17191042">looping cross past Bernd Leno in front of the visiting fans</a> .</p>
      <p>That result keeps <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> ' Premier League unbeaten run since September 14's 5-2 defeat to Chelsea intact and was the perfect tonic to the 2-1 Carabao Cup loss to West Midlands rivals Aston Villa on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>For Jimenez, too, it was a welcome strike - he now has two goals in two games in the League - after a barren run of four goalless matches.</p>
