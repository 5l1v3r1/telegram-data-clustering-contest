      <h1>Mesut Ozil sends message to Unai Emery after second Arsenal start in Premier League</h1>
      <h2>The World Cup winner returned for the Gunners as they drew 1-1 with Wolves on Saturday afternoon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T18:56:03+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 18:56</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Mesut Ozil announced it's good to be back playing Premier League football after making his second domestic start of the season against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves.</a></p>
      <p>The Gunners' best-paid player has fallen down the pecking order under Emery, but impressed in Arsenal's Carabao Cup defeat by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>As a result, Emery opted to include him in his starting XI for this weekend's 1-1 draw with Wolves, with Ozil offering <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> more creativity in the middle of the park.</p>
      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> after the game, Ozil wrote: "Good to be back in Premier League action, but not happy about the result at home.</p>

      <p>"Many things to work on. We have to keep moving forward with our heads held high."</p>
      <p>Emery announced on Friday Ozil would line up against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> as he ruled out Granit Xhaka.</p>
      <p>The Swiss clashed with fans during last Sunday's draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace,</a> after supporters booed him as he was subbed off at the Emirates.</p>

      <p>"He is training normally, but like every human he feels emotions. Xhaka's issues last week need time to recover the normality with him and with us," said Emery.</p>
      <p>"Xhaka has said sorry, he gave apologies to the supporters, to everybody."</p>
