      <p>Wing Steff Evans scored a crucial try on his 100th regional appearance as <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/scarlets">Scarlets</a> held on for victory in a closely-fought Guinness PRO14 clash.</p>
      <p>Scrum-half <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/scarlets/players/kieran-hardy/">Kieran Hardy</a> also crossed in the 17-13 success in the rain at Parc y Scarlets, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/scarlets/players/dan-jones/">Dan Jones</a> adding seven points with the boot.</p>
      <p>Cheetahs, who made it a real contest, were indebted to a try for scrum-half Tian Meyer. Tian Schoeman and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/montpellier/players/ruan-pienaar/">Ruan Pienaar</a> shared eight points with the boot.</p>
      <p>Samoa’s <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/scarlets/players/kieron-fonotia/">Kieron Fonotia</a> started at centre for Scarlets after returning from World Cup duty, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/scarlets/players/marc-jones/">Marc Jones</a> got the nod at hooker, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/scarlets/players/lewis-rawlins/">Lewis Rawlins</a> started at lock and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/scarlets/players/ed-kennedy/">Ed Kennedy</a> came into the back-row from the side that lost 46-7 at Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>Cheetahs lost 24-22 at <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/connacht">Connacht</a> last week and were without centre <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/currie-cup/teams/cheetahs/players/dries-swanepoel/">Dries Swanepoel</a>, given a three-match ban following his red card in that game.</p>
      <p>Cheetahs opened the scoring with a 13th minute try from Meyer, who picked up a kick ahead by Janse van Rensburg to go over. Schoeman converted.</p>
      <p>But Scarlets clawed their way back into the contest in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>First Evans crossed from a line-out in the 22nd minute, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/scarlets/players/dan-jones/">Dan Jones</a> grabbing the conversion.</p>
      <p>Three minutes before half-time Hardy exploited a gap down the blindside to go over after a turnover from Fonotia – and a break by Johnny McNicholl. Jones converted again for a 14-7 interval advantage.</p>
      <p>It took the South African team only two minutes of the second half to get back into the contest with a Schoeman penalty.</p>
      <p>And the visitors were boosted by the appearance of veteran replacement scrum-half Pienaar, who coolly kicked a penalty goal from a collapsed scrum.</p>
      <p>It brought <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/currie-cup/teams/cheetahs">Cheetahs</a> to within a point – but two minutes later Jones converted his second penalty after full-back <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/sharks/players/rhyno-smith/">Rhyno Smith</a> had been penalised for holding on, on the floor.</p>
      <p>Scarlets managed to maintain their advantage and it did not matter that Jones missed a penalty shot at goal with the final kick of the game.</p>
