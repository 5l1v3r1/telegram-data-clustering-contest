      <p>A special art project is trying to get thousands of Berliners to shake hands to symbolise German reunification.</p>
      <p>It comes ahead of preparations for November 9, when the country will mark 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
      <p>The project wants to gather 10,957 clay moulds of people shaking hands â€” one for every day since the structure tumbled in 1989.</p>
      <p>Dutch artist Meike Ziegler got strangers to chat and then bring their hands together with a ball of clay in the middle.</p>
      <p>This creates a unique mould impression of their encounter. The plan is to use the moulds to make a symbolic wall of unification.</p>
      <p>"As this was a divided city for a long time, I thought let's take the ingredient of the division, the wall, and create connection," said Ziegler.</p>
      <p>"That's as simple as it is and brings East and West Berliners together."</p>
