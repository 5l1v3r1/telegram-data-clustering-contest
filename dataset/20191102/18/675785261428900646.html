      <h1>Harry Maguire slams Man Utd's quality in final third after defeat by Bournemouth</h1>
      <h2>Man United were beaten for a fourth time in the Premier League this season, with Joshua King netting the game's only goal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T18:32:49+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 18:32</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Harry Maguire has hit out at Manchester United's performance in the 1-0 defeat by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth,</a> saying his team-mates lacked quality in the final third.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils were beaten for a fourth time in the Premier League this season, with Joshua King netting the only goal of the game at the Vitality Stadium.</p>
      <p>United squandered chances to get back in the match as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made two attacking substitutions in the second half, bringing on Mason Greenwood and Jesse Lingard.</p>
      <p>And Â£80million summer signing Maguire has called on his team-mates to improve.</p>
      <p>He told MUTV: "[We are] disappointed. We conceded at an awful time at a stage where we started the game really well.</p>

      <p>"The first 20 minutes we were well on top, we have got to score in that period, with numerous chances.</p>
      <p>"The quality in the final third wasn't good enough to create a real clear cut chance, then they came into the game at the end of the first-half and it is an awful time to concede just before half-time, it is probably the worst."</p>

      <p>Solskjaer added: "Mason Greenwood was unlucky when he hit the post, I saw him scoring those chances more than missing them, but he will come good.</p>
      <p>"I thought Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial defended very well against them, but in games like this one it is so important get the first goal and they did it."</p>
