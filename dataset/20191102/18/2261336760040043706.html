      <p>Rising UFC welterweight contender Vicente Luque can’t wait to be in the Octagon for the biggest fight of his career yet. However, the ‘Silent Assassin’ does not believe in changing his style entirely to secure the win, not even against former title challenger Stephen Thompson.</p>

      <p>In an interview with<a href="https://sportv.globo.com/site/combate/noticia/luque-ve-thompson-como-rival-ideal-e-brinca-merecemos-o-cinturao-do-cara-mais-gente-boa.ghtml"> Combate</a>, the 27-year-old did explain he studied Thompson’s game, and believes he only needs to adapt some of the things he already does in order to emerge victorious, as opposed to changing his essence.</p>
      <p>“This is what I did, a lot of training sessions emulating Thompson’s style, but at the same time I focused a lot on my own strong suits,” Luque said. “I don’t think I have to change my entire game for him. It’s more like adapting it a little bit to what he has. I’ll try to implement my pace, that’s the way. I always watch tape on my opponents to see their reactions. Thompson moves very well. So I’m like ‘cool, I’ll move, too’. Then I focus a lot on my cardio so I can move well. Those are the adjustments. My arsenal is very solid, I won’t change who I am for anybody.”</p>
      <p>With nine UFC wins by way of submission or knockout, Vicente will take on a karate and kickboxing champion with five knockout wins in the Octagon, as well. A combination of styles that Luque believes will prove to be great for fans who expect an exciting striking battle.</p>
      <p>“We have different styles, but we’re both strikers,” Luque said. “His style is more about movement, he likes to counter a lot, he has those kicks, spinning ones, too. I’m a kickboxer, Muay Thai guy, I’m more traditional. I walk forward, I put pressure and look for the knockout all the time. This combination of styles will result in an action-packed fight. I think it will be excellent for the fans.”</p>
      <p>On six-fight winning streak, Vicente Luque (17-6-1) defeated the likes of Niko Price, Mike Perry and Bryan Barberena, among others, in his last outings, all but one via finish. His last loss happened in March 2017, when he dropped a unanimous decision to contender Leon Edwards.</p>
      <p>Now, Vicente Luque is expected to take on Stephen Thompson at UFC 244, in New York City, on November 2. The card is scheduled to be headlined by a welterweight bout between Nate Diaz and Jorge Masvidal.</p>
