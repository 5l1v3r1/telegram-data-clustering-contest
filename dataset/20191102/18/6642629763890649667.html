      <p>Dresden's city council backed a resolution against far-right ideas with the title "Nazinotstand?", or "Nazi emergency?".</p>
      <p>It was brought by Max Aschenbach, a local councillor for left-leaning satirical party Die Partei, who told DPA news agency that "this city has a Nazi problem".</p>
      <p>The resolution said the city was "worried that anti-democratic, anti-pluralist, discriminatory and far-right positions which include violence" were on the rise in Dresden.</p>
      <p>It called for the "strengthening of a democratic culture", making a priority of "the protection of minorities, human rights and victims of extreme-right violence".</p>
      <p>The motion also stressed the importance to fight "anti-Semitism, racism and Islamophobia".</p>
      <p>The resolution was approved by 39 council member votes against 29.</p>
      <p>It was backed by the left and liberal parties, but rejected not only by the AfD members but also by centre-right Christian Democrats who said it should not have targeted right-wing extremism only.</p>
      <p>"The title is clearly pointed," said Thomas Loeser, a council member for the Green party.</p>
      <p>"But we, as the city community, clearly declare our support for those who oppose racism and anti-Semitism, and expect everybody else to do the same," he said.</p>
      <p>The AfD is especially strong in Germany's east which, almost 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, lags behind the west in jobs and prosperity and has been a hotspot for xenophobia, racist hate crimes and support for far-right groups.</p>
      <p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision in 2015 to let in about one million refugees and migrants, many fleeing wars in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/middleeast.html">Middle East</a>, has fuelled support for far-right groups such as Pegida and the AfD.</p>
      <p>Last month, the AfD <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/germany-afd-gains-thuringia-state-elections-191027192910248.html">surged</a> to second place in local elections in the east German state of Thuringia, taking 24 percent of the vote, with Merkel's centre-right Christian Democratic Union party coming one percentage point behind.</p>
