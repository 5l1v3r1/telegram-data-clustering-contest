      <h1>It sure sounds like StarCraft 2's devs would like to make StarCraft 3</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T23:24:45+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 23:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/tyler-wilde/" target="_blank">Tyler Wilde</a></address>
      <p>Speaking to StarCraft 2 production director Tim Morton and lead co-op designer Kevin Dong at BlizzCon earlier today, I had to ask: Are you making StarCraft 3? Blizzard announced numbered sequels to two of its biggest series this week, after all, so it's not out of the question. </p>
      <p>Morton's answer didn't suggest that StarCraft 3 is secretly in production—though he could have an excellent poker face—but did suggest that he'd very much like to build it. </p>
      <p>"The best way for us to figure out our future is to hear from players," said Morton. "So, I think if there's an interest in seeing more RTS games, sending that message to Blizzard would be a wonderful thing."</p>
      <p>I asked if they were waiting for the right time, then. "Ultimately, the team that works on StarCraft 2 is incredibly passionate about real-time strategy as a genre," said Morton. "I can certainly say it's my favorite genre to play and so far it's been my favorite genre to work on."</p>
      <p>Dong agreed, and we talked about the genre a bit. Morton brought up recent independent games in the genre like Tooth &amp; Tail and They Are Billions, as well as Microsoft and Relic's work on Age of Empires 4.</p>
      <p>"I actually think there's a great opportunity there in the future, but yeah, we'll just have to see what the future holds," he said.</p>
      <p>Morton is clearly happy to be working on StarCraft 2, which still has a very dedicated base of both competitive and cooperative players. The cooperative mode is actually StarCraft 2's most popular mode now, he tells me, as it keeps non-competitive players who might've left after the campaign around. I also discussed with Dong how DeepMind AI competitions are causing players to question the meta. There's a long held tradition of using 16 workers per mineral mine. The AI, however, recently used as many as 21, and players are wondering who's right.</p>
      <p>But it sure sounds like Morton is up for StarCraft 3, if Blizzard gave it the green light—and it sounds like demonstrating a bigger market for new RTSes is the key to that. </p>
      <p>We didn't get into what such a sequel would look like, but maybe <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/heres-how-diablo-4s-shared-world-works/">Diablo 4</a>'s new engine could be put to use in that respect. </p>
