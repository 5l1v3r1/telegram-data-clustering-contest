      <p>Celebrity X Factor fans noticed a startling similarity Nicole Scherzinger and Jenny Ryan's dresses this evening.</p>
      <p>The ITV show returned tonight for another live show full of soaring vocals, eye-wincing screeching and tear-jerker moments.</p>
      <p>During the second live show, fans instantly flocked to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to comment on the similarity between Celebrity <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> judge Nicole Scherzinger's, 41, and contestant Jenny Ryan's, 37, outfit choices.</p>
      <p>Viewers were sent into meltdown after both women stepped out onto The X Factor stage in fiery red dresses and hilariously accused X Factor stylists of purchasing material from a carpet shop to create the two outfits.</p>

      <p>Pop sensation Nicole wowed in a flaming scarlet number which featured a one-shouldered design with a dramatic floaty sleeve and sequinned embellishments.</p>
      <p>While The Chase star Jenny also turned heads in a flamboyant red dress with a long-draping train and sheer tie-up jacket detailing.</p>
      <p>One eagle-eyed fan spotted the similarities between their outfits and took to Twitter with a comical explanation.</p>
      <p>They wrote: "When the X Factor Celebrity budget is that low, you’ve gotta pop to Carpetright, buy a red carpet and make two dresses from it. RIP X Factor."</p>

      <p>Another user also noticed the curtain-inspired look. They wrote: "Why did they dress Jenny like a 80's curtain?"</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, another X Factor Celebrity viewer screen-grabbed a hilarious shot of Nicole watching Jenny perform and posted the snap alongside a hilarious caption.</p>

      <p>Other viewers were unimpressed with tonight's fashion choices.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "Jenny's dressed like a mixture between them Dolls that go over loo roll and them mad Spanish flamenco dolls you bring back from your holiday...."</p>
      <p>Another noticed the wardrobe malfunction between the two stars. They tweeted: "How embarrassing. It seems Jenny and Nicole have worn the same dress tonight."</p>
      <p>While another appeared to blame X Factor stylists. They commented: "Sorry but that dress is an abomination! Sack the wardrobe people forthwith."</p>

      <p>The Chase star secured herself a safe chair through to this Saturday’s show following her powerful rendition of Conchita Wurst’s Eurovision winner Rise Like A Phoenix last week.</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old recently opened up about her battle with depression and how singing helped her with her struggles.</p>
      <p>The quiz-master said her mentor Nicole approached her backstage to discuss her experience.</p>
      <p>She recently told New magazine: "After the show, she said music is her prescription for feeling better and that meant we immediately had a bond."</p>
