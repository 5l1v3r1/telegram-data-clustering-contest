        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon">Alexander Albon</a> will start the United States Grand Prix from P6. The Thai-British Red Bull driver looks back with mixed feelings on his final lap in Q3. Yet according to the Albon, P6 isn't a bad result for the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Aston Martin Red Bull Racing</a> driver. </b>
      </p>
      <p><i>“It was okay. I made a mistake in the final round. My pace was not as good as that of the other boys, but certainly not bad,"</i> Albon reported in front of the Ziggo Sport camera. </p>

      <p>Jack Plooij concludes that he must be very much at the limit: <i>“Yes, it's not easy. Max pushes a little more at the limit. It's not bad for me, because I had quite a bit of trouble in the third free practice,"</i> Albon replies.</p>
      <p><i>“We have soft tires, hopefully, we can catch up with someone like Lewis at the start. Hopefully, someone will suffer from tyre degradation,"</i> said the Red Bull driver.</p>
