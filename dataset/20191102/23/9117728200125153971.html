        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lando-norris">Lando Norris</a> is fast becoming the next flagbearer for Formula 1 in Britain. The <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> driver says he looked up to <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> during his childhood and would like to improve on and be as a good as the five-time F1 world champion. </b>

      <p>During the weekend in the United States, the younger drivers have been giving their thoughts on Hamilton as he moves closer to his sixth F1 crown. Norris is no different. </p>
      <p><i>"I guess he’s a guy who I’ve always looked up to since I was young. A driver who I’ve loved to watch. I’ve been very excited to watch a lot of his races since I started watching F1 when I was six or seven years old. So, I’ve kind of not been on the journey but I’ve been able to watch a lot of the races and it gives a bit of… I wouldn’t say belief or faith but it gives a bit of confidence knowing that or hoping to go into the future and emulate him in a way,"</i> Norris is quoted by the BBC. </p>

        <i>"So some things aren’t going to be exactly the same; it’s not possible to do the same as other drivers – but there are a lot of things that he’s extremely good at and I would like to improve on and be as good as him on, so yeah, a guy and a driver who’s inspired me and who I’ve looked up to since I was very young."</i>
