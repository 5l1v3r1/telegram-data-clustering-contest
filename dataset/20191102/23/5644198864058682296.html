      <p><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210239">Apple has announced</a> that some iPhone and iPad models introduced in 2012 and earlier will require an iOS update, or they could stop working correctly.</p>
      <p>The issue is due to a GPS time rollover issue, Apple said.</p>
      <p>In particular, an update is required for iPhone 5 to maintain accurate GPS location and to continue to use functions that rely on correct date and time including App Store, iCloud, email, and web browsing, Apple said.</p>
      <p>If the update is not completed by Sunday, users will have to back up and restore using a Mac or PC in order to update because over-the-air software updates and iCloud Backup will not work, Apple said.</p>
      <p>The updated software version should be 10.3.4 or 9.3.6, depending on your device.</p>

      <p>The issue does not affect iPod touch or any iPad models that have Wi-Fi only. It also doesn't affect iOS devices newer than those listed above.</p>
