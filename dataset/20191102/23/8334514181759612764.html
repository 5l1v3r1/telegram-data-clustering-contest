      <p>MADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s Socialists lead in voting intentions ahead of the Nov. 10 election but will lose two seats compared to the last parliamentary election in April, again failing to reach a majority, the latest 40Db poll for newspaper El Pais showed on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Socialists would win 121 seats, down from 123 in April, and neither the left-wing nor right-wing parties would win a majority.</p>
      <p>The poll also showed far-right party Vox winning more seats than in April to become Spain’s third biggest party with 46 seats, up from 24.</p>
      <p>The 40Db poll also showed the conservative People’s Party (PP) would win 91 seats, up from 66 in April, while centre-right Ciudadanos would plunge to 14 seats from their previous 57.</p>
