      <h1>Liz Peek and Jessica Tarlov respond to Carly Simon's #MeToo criticism</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T01:21:24+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 01:21</time> by <a rel="author">Victor Garcia</a></address>
      <p>The "Ladies Night" panel reacted to singer-songwriter <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/carly-simon-repulsive-trump-bill-clinton">Carly Simon</a>'s critique of the #MeToo movement on Friday on "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/the-story">The Story with Martha MacCallum</a>."</p>
      <p>Simon, who is promoting her memoir, "Touched By The Sun," told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/31/carly-simon-on-turning-down-donald-trump-i-thought-he-was-kind-of-repulsive">The Guardian</a> that the movement has made it "dangerous for men to act like men."</p>
      <p>“I welcome it and now I hope that it will go back to a position where things will be normalized,” <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/carly-simon-repulsive-trump-bill-clinton">Simon told the publication</a> before voicing her concerns with #MeToo. “Not that I want anybody to shut up or to not tell it like it is, but it also feels a little bit unnatural for me that men can’t say a flattering thing to a woman without there being a possible reckoning."</p>

      <p>"Not that the men who go overboard and disrespect a woman are acting like men. You know what I mean.”</p>
      <p>Fox News contributor Liz Peek agreed with Simon, saying the movement started in a "good place" but has gone "too far."</p>
      <p>"I think we've kind of neutered American men," Peek said bluntly. "Look, how are you going to flirt? How are you going to attract a woman if you're scared to death that you say, 'hey, baby' And you're gonna get called out for that?"</p>
      <p>Peek was referencing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/49ers-jimmy-garoppolo-erin-andrews-feels-great-baby">San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo</a>, who faced scrutiny on Twitter after it appeared he'd made a pass at Fox Sports' Erin Andrews following a football game on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Andrews interviewed Garoppolo on the field, asking him how it felt to keep the winning streak going.</p>
      <p>He answered: “It feels great, baby. Happy Halloween.”</p>

      <p>Democratic strategist Jessica Tarlov wasn't offended by the quarterback's comments but was concerned with "conflating" Simon's comments with real abuse claims.</p>
      <p>"There is a big danger of conflating a conversation, what Carly Simon is talking about, with the very real claims of abuse and sexual assault," Tarlov said.</p>
