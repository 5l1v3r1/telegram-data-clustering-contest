      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jennifer-aniston">Jennifer Aniston</a> has confessed she stole a neon light from Central Perk on her last day of filming the hit TV show Friends.</p>
      <p>The actress played Rachel Green for 10 years on the iconic sitcom and shared some behind the scenes gossip as she appeared on the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/graham-norton">Graham Norton</a> Show last night.</p>
      <p>She was joined by Reese Witherspoon to promote their new series The Morning Show, alongside British icons Sir Ian McKellen and Dame Julie Andrews.</p>
      <p>Graham asked: "Jennifer you took a bit of Friends when you left at the end, didn't you?"</p>
      <p>And Jennifer gushed back: "I took all five of them," as the audience burst out with "ahhh".</p>

      <p>While it's been 25 years since Friends first hit our screens, Jennifer has maintained a close friendship with her co-stars Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer.</p>
      <p>Jen did admit to taking the light-up neon coffee sign from Central Perk, which now sits in her office.</p>
      <p>It comes after the 50-year-old signed up to Instagram and delighted fans with an epic Friends reunion cast snap.</p>
