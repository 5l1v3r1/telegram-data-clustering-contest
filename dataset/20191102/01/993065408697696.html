      <p>BACK IN THE DAY</p>
      <p>The Irish News, November 2 2009: Hurling/Shinty International: Scotland 1-8 Ireland 1-11</p>

      <p>Led by Kilkenny’s Hurler of the Year Tommy Walsh, the seniors withstood six gruelling minutes of injury-time, as his team-mate Shane Dooley snatched a goal four minutes into added-time which pushed Ireland to a 1-11 to 1-8 victory.</p>
      <p>In a side managed by Shane’s dad, Joe, with Down’s Jim McKernan and Kevin Ryan of Carlow as selectors, Down’s Gareth ‘Magic’ Johnston, Armagh’s Paul McCormack and Johnny McIntosh of Antrim were among those who gave excellent displays.</p>
