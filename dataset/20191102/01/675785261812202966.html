      <p>A Euromillions winner who scooped £76 million in the lottery draw has married his partner in their local pub.</p>
      <p>Andrew Clark, 51, and his girlfriend Trisha Fairhurst, 52, tied the knot almost a year after he won the incredible prize last December.</p>
      <p>The self-employed builder, of Boston, Lincolnshire, had no idea he was the owner of Britain's biggest ever unclaimed lottery ticket for well over a month.</p>
      <p>With a habit of stockpiling tickets in his van, he worked through many cold and wet winter days, unaware he had become a multi-millionaire.</p>
      <p>It was only when his partner's niece, Louise, reminded him to check his tickets, tucked in the visor of his Peugeot Expert, that he discovered his win.</p>

      <p>When he finally called to confirm his win, he was heard saying: "I think I've won a few quid."</p>
      <p>When he won the big prize, Andrew was coy about any wedding plans but shortly afterwards Trisha quit her hospital kitchen job, reports <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10262265/lottery-winner-marries-girlfriend-pub/">The Sun.</a></p>
      <p>They started planning their nuptials and decided to tie the knot in their local wedding venue, The Poachers.</p>
      <p>Family and friends gathered at an intimate ceremony and enjoyed a reception at the pub afterwards.</p>

      <p>While they didn't go for a celebrity style wedding, the couple have bought a new house and Andy splashed out £700,000 on supercars including a Porsche, a McLaren and a Mercedes.</p>
      <p>Despite being worth millions, Trisha has eschewed fancy cars and still drives her £20,000 Nissan Quashqai.</p>
      <p>A source told the newspaper: “Andy and Trisha are determined to keep their feet on the ground - it’s only the cars where Andy has really spent money.</p>

      <p>“They just wanted a close-knit ceremony with all their family and friends and The Poachers was easy for everyone to get to.</p>
      <p>“It might not be fancy but they still had a terrific time.”</p>
      <p>Camelot the couple have declined to comment.</p>
