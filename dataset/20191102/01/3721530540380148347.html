      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/1/20942471/diablo-4-blizzard-blizzcon-release-date-announcement">Blizzard announced <i>Diablo 4</i><i> </i>at BlizzCon 2019</a>. The game’s tone sees a return to Blizzard’s darker side, and the gameplay features far more RPG elements than <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/diablo-3/2579"><i>Diablo 3</i></a>. With a more open world and slower combat, some Diablo fans may worry that the game they’ve come to love over the past eight years won’t carry forward.</p>
      <p>But worry not, <i>Diablo 3</i> fans; seasons, sets, and rifts will still be around in <i>Diablo 4</i>. At BlizzCon 2019, we sat down and spoke to executive producer Allen Adham, art director John Mueller, and game director Luis Barriga about maintaining <i>Diablo 3</i>’s successes.</p>
      <p>While they wouldn’t offer up much information, the devs confirmed that <i>Diablo 4</i> will have seasons. The instantly repeatable Nephalem Rift game mode will also feature into <i>Diablo 4</i>. Adham mentioned the team has a few different game modes in mind between Rifts and PvP.</p>
      <p>In terms of Adventure Mode — the game mode in<i> Diablo 3</i> that lets players hop around the map in a non-linear fashion — there isn’t as much of a need for it. <i>Diablo 4</i> will be slower in many ways, and that includes traversal.</p>
      <p>Players won’t teleport between waypoints nearly as frequently, and will instead ride mounts everywhere they go. But the idea of a replayable open environment is still something the team is chasing through world event enemies and repeatable dungeons.</p>
      <p>Sets and Legendaries are also back, although they won’t be as overpowered as they are in <i>Diablo 3</i>. Barriga gave us an example of a Legendary in the <i>Diablo 4</i> BlizzCon demo:</p>
      <blockquote>There’s a staff legendary in the demo that turns [the spell] fireball into a triple fireball spell. The difference might be that, you know, a set right now in live <i>Diablo 3</i> gives you bonuses more in the thousands. I think we’re designing the game right now to be a little bit more constrained to avoid getting us into that super escalating power curve.</blockquote>
      <p>In all its aspects, <i>Diablo 4</i> is a bit slower, more plodding, and dangerous. Blizzard intends the level of player power to reflect that. That sets and Legendaries are still a key part of the Diablo build process — they just won’t be as strong as they are in <i>Diablo 3</i>.</p>
