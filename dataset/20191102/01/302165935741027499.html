      <h1>Here’s a first look at the first watch to run on Xiaomi’s MIUI (VIDEO)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T01:32:34+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 01:32</time> by <a rel="author">BY NIC KER</a></address>
      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 2 — The <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/10/29/xiaomi-watch-apple-watch-clone-launch/">Xiaomi Watch</a> is set to launch soon, with the smartwatch expected to be announced on November 5 in China alongside the Xiaomi CC9 Pro.</p>
      <p>Not much is known about the watch beyond its uncanny resemblance to the <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/apple-watch">Apple Watch</a>, but it appears that the Xiaomi Watch (or perhaps the Mi Watch globally) will run on a scaled down version of MIUI — Xiaomi’s skin for its smartphones.</p>

      <p>This would be the first smartwatch to run on MIUI, although it isn’t yet clear if the UI will be layered over a version of <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/wear-os">Wear OS</a>.</p>
      <p>From videos that have <a href="https://www.weibo.com/1749127163/IdTlmki7K">surfaced</a> on <a href="https://www.weibo.com/1245242010/IdS8eeIBv">Weibo</a>, it looks like navigation is controlled by a digital crown on the right side of the smartwatch, and the UI looks like it could have a dark mode implemented.</p>
      <p>However, we can’t really tell from the video if the display will be an OLED display, which is arguably a must-have on a good smartwatch.</p>

      <p>According to the founder and CEO of Xiaomi, <a href="https://www.weibo.com/1749127163/IdHEfh06z?type=comment#_rnd1572351019955">Lei Jun</a>, the Xiaomi Watch will be available in 2 colours: Black and Silver.</p>
      <p>There will also be support for WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPS — as well as the ability to make voice calls.</p>
      <p>While we don’t have any concrete details regarding potential availability just yet, the videos of the Apple Watch-lookalike certainly tease an interesting device. — <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/11/01/xiaomi-mi-watch-miui-android-wear-os-smartwatch/">SoyaCincau</a></p>
