        <b>Letters are being sent to 30,000 households across the UK inviting people to join a citizens' assembly on climate change.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Once participants are selected, the assembly will meet next year, with the outcome of their discussions reported back to Parliament.</p>
      <p>The initiative, set up by cross party MPs, will look at what members of the public can do to reduce CO2.</p>
      <p>The UK government has committed to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.</p>

      <p>Rachel Reeves, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee, one of six select committees who commissioned the climate assembly, said a clear roadmap was needed to achieve this goal.</p>
      <p>"Finding solutions which are equitable and have public support will be crucial," she said.</p>
      <p>"Parliament needs to work with the people and with government to address the challenge of climate change."</p>
      <h3>Random selection</h3>
      <p>The invitees to Climate Assembly UK have been selected at random from across the UK. From those who respond, 110 people will be chosen as a representative sample of the population.</p>
      <p>They will meet over four weekends from late January in Birmingham, and will discuss topics ranging from transport to household energy use.</p>
      <p>A citizens' assembly has been a key demand of the environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion, whose protests caused widespread disruption this year.</p>
      <p>The group said they welcomed this as a first step, but warned that the assembly should be focussing on cutting carbon emissions to net zero by 2025 not 2050.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson Linda Doyle said: "Waiting 30 years to reach zero net carbon emissions is a death sentence to people around the world and in the UK - it gives us a higher chance of breaching irreversible tipping points as the climate breaks down and it only serves short term 'business as usual'."</p>
      <h3>Complex issues</h3>
      <p>Environmental group Friends of the Earth said citizens' assemblies could play an important part in policy-making.</p>
      <p>Dave Timms, head of political affairs at FOE, said: "Tackling the climate emergency with the speed required will require radical changes to our economy, infrastructure and even to society so it's important that there is a consensus among citizens.</p>
      <p>"Much of what needs to be done already commands widespread public support and it is politicians that just need to bloody-well get on with it now."</p>
      <p>Citizens' assemblies have been used in a number of countries around the world.</p>
      <p>In Ireland, a panel of 99 people was established in 2016 to look at a range of political questions, including abortion.</p>
      <p>They recommended that the country should overturn its ban and suggested a referendum, which went on to support repeal.</p>
      <p>In Canada and the Netherlands, the approach has been used to discuss electoral reform.</p>
