      <p>THE north's biggest bank increased its profits again in the first nine months of this year - despite its chief executive admitting demand for new borrowing "continues to be subdued".</p>
      <p>Danske Bank, which employs 1,500 staff at 40 branches and business centres across Northern Ireland, saw pre-tax profits over the period lift by 6 per cent to £71.1 million.</p>
      <p>It came on total incomes of £175.5 million, and was helped by the bank reducing its expenses to £103 million and with loans impairments down to £1.4m over the nine months compared to £3.1m in the corresponding period in 2018.</p>
      <p>Lending was 3 per cent higher year-on-year at £5.547 billion, with retail customer activity levels remaining satisfactory.</p>
      <p>Danske said new lending to businesses was impacted by Brexit, with some larger customers delaying investment decisions.</p>
      <p>Customer deposits grew by 5 per cent year-on-year from £6.99 billion to £7.37 billion.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Kevin Kingston said: “I'm pleased to report an operating profit before impairments of £72.5 million for the first nine months, and the underlying performance of the bank remains satisfactory, with lending up 3 per cent year-on-year.</p>
      <p>“In personal banking, we continue to provide attractive mortgage packages with very competitive rates and market leading cashback offers.</p>
      <p>“As part of our autumn mortgage campaign we announced further reductions in fixed rate mortgage products, which has led to an increase in approvals, especially in the re-mortgage switcher market.</p>
      <p>“Indeed Danske Bank currently provides over one in four of all mortgages across Northern Ireland and our total mortgage lending is at its highest ever level.”</p>
      <p>He added: “In business banking, demand for lending continues to be subdued as a result of uncertainty around the stretched Brexit process.</p>
      <p>“It is important to note that our capacity to support new business lending remains strong, but current demand levels are below what we would expect in a more normalised trading environment.</p>
      <p>“There has been a notable uplift in customer requests for support, advice and guidance from our Business Banking relationship managers – these are conversations we encourage and value.</p>
      <p>“In the short-term, the business community awaits much-needed clarity on what the Brexit journey will look like. But the reality is, whatever shape it takes, it will only be the beginning of a new operating environment, and the process of change will be a significant factor in everybody’s lives for many years to come.”</p>
      <p>Danske's Copenhagen-based parent company made a net profit of $450m in the third quarter, although operating expenses rose by 2 per cent due to higher compliance costs and anti-money laundering activities, mainly as a result of activities at its Estonian operation.</p>
