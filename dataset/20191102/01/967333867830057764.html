      <p>A motorcycle ride can be twice as joyful if the rider has paws and a tail. Look how confident this little pooch is riding on the highway. His hoomans also don't have any doubts about his skills and can relax on the pillion seat. The sun is shining, the guys are chilling, the doggo is riding - the harmony is everywhere.</p>
