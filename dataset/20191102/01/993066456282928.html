      <p>POLICE have been called to investigate threats made against UUP staff amid unionist pressure on the party to form an electoral pact with the DUP.</p>
      <p>UUP leader-elect Steve Aiken on Thursday night confirmed that threats had been made against party staff, saying it undermined "the entire principle of democracy".</p>
      <p>The MLA has faced mounting criticism from some unionists for ruling out a pact with the DUP in the forthcoming Westminster election.</p>
      <p>But speaking on BBC's The View programme, he appeared to row back on his commitment as he refused to say if the UUP would contest every Northern Ireland constituency.</p>
      <p>People have contacted the UUP's headquarters to complain about not having a pact with the DUP in North Belfast, the broadcaster yesterday reported.</p>
      <p>It also said that police were understood to have been informed about threats made online.</p>
      <p>DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, who is seeking re-election as MP for North Belfast, condemned the threats.</p>
      <p>"There have been some reports of intimidation and threats issued towards members and activists from the UUP. Any such incidents are deplorable and must be totally condemned," he said.</p>
      <p>"The only appropriate way to express your views and the most effective way to send a message in our society is through the ballot box."</p>
