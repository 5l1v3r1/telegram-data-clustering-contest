      <p>MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican authorities say two people have been killed and 35 homes damaged by two wildfires burning in the northwestern border state of Baja California.</p>
      <p>The federal Department of Security and Citizen Protection said late Friday in a statement that the blazes were located in the areas of Ensenada and Rosarito.</p>
      <p>The former covered about 60 acres (25 hectares) and was 95% extinguished. The latter covered about 25 acres (10 hectares) and there was no information on how much had been brought under control.</p>
      <p>The department said the toll of deaths and damage was recorded since the fires “reactivated” Oct. 30.</p>
      <p>Baja California state is across from California, which has also been hit by wildfires recently amid windy and dry conditions.</p>
