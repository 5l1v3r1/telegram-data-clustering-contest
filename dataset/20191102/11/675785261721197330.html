      <h2>WARNING DISTRESSING FOOTAGE Mike Jones-Mathias, from Wales, was working in Thailand when he was violently attacked, an inquest into his death heard</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T11:49:20+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 11:49</time> by <a rel="author">Wales News Service</a></address>
      <p>A retired Army major died after being punched in the head by a go-go bar bouncer in Thailand, an inquest heard.</p>
      <p>Mike Jones-Mathias was on a work trip in Pattaya when he was violently attacked in front of horrified holidaymakers.</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old, who retired as a major from the Corps of Royal Engineers, visited Mandarin Agogo bar for a drink on his way back to his hotel on May 17 last year.</p>
      <p>An inquest heard that while inside the bar, he dialled emergency number 911 - just five minutes before CCTV captured him being punched to the floor.</p>
      <p>The video, played at the inquest, shows Mike in the street outside the bar before he is approached by two men and hit to the floor with one horror punch.</p>
      <p>Security guard Phumphat Tanosingh was charged with grievous bodily harm following a Thai police investigation into the attack and faced a trial in Thailand.</p>
      <p>But he was found not guilty after claiming self-defence - claiming Mike had attempted to leave the Mandarin Agogo bar without paying his bill.</p>
      <p>Wife Veronica, 50, said: "For the record, I know my husband would never have left a bar without paying a bill.</p>
      <p>"What could have happened in that establishment that could make that punch lawful?"</p>
      <p>She questioned why her husband would have called for emergency assistance while in the bar.</p>

      <p>The inquest in Pontypridd, South Wales heard Mike was at the start of a three-month work trip as a senior operations project manager.</p>
      <p>He had gone for an evening meal with his senior management team but later decided to stop at a bar alone.</p>
      <p>Veronica said: "At no point in the court transcript does it mention the video shown. Why was the video not shown in evidence?</p>
      <p>"The judgement was handed down without them knowing that Mike was dead. Had they known I wonder whether or not the conclusion would have been different."</p>
      <p>She added her husband put up a "monumental fight" while recovering from his brain injury.</p>
      <p>The inquest heard Mike underwent surgery in Thailand for damage to his right frontal lobe and was finally flown to Cardiff six weeks later.</p>
      <p>But he tragically died on March 24 this year after his health deteriorated.</p>
      <p>Professor Phillip Smith, of University Hospital of Wales, gave a cause of death as pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and traumatic brain injury.</p>

      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Mike, of Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan, graduated as an officer in the Army in 1984 and served in the first Gulf War.</p>
      <p>He later became a detective sergeant for Gwent Police before moving on to become an operations manager on engineering projects in the Middle East.</p>
      <p>The inquest heard Mike and wife Veronica had opened a cafe in Cardiff when they returned to the UK in 2015.</p>
      <p>But he was asked to go to Thailand for the three month trip in his former role as operations manager.</p>
      <p>Acting senior coroner Graeme Hughes rejected the family's request for a conclusion of unlawful killing.</p>
      <p>He said: "Yes, it was on the evidence deliberate but was it unlawful?</p>
      <p>"I haven't heard any evidence from the assailant. If he was here in the UK then he would be called as a witness and he could be questioned.</p>
      <p>"He has not had the opportunity to come before me and make representations to me.</p>
      <p>"I have to bear in mind that there was a trial of some sorts in Thailand and as a consequence, he was acquitted.</p>
      <p>"I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it would be safe for me to reach unlawful killing."</p>

      <p>Recording a narrative conclusion, he said: "The deceased died as a consequence of complications arising from head injuries sustained following a punch to the head."</p>
      <p>After the inquest, wife Veronica said: "Mike was a man of uniform. He was a man of duty. He was a stickler for doing the right thing.</p>
      <p>"There is no way he would have left without paying a bill.</p>
      <p>"I thank God he was resuscitated after he was punched because I had another 11 months with him."</p>
