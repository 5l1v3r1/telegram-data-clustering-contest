      <p>A make up artist sent a video of herself as an animated pig begging her boyfriend to get a Chinese takeaway to her boss who she had known for just two days.</p>
      <p>Issie Carmody, 22, was "mortified" when she realised her mistake, which has since been seen by thousands.</p>
      <p>Issie, from Corsham, Wilts, shared the "idiotic" clip on social media after her boss saw the funny side.</p>
      <p>She uses an app to turn her face into that of a pig and then repeats the word "Chinese" in a variety of voices.</p>
      <p>"Guys I’m actually f <b>******</b>  mortified," she says.</p>
      <p>"I recently got a new manager at my work, and I've known her for two days!"</p>
      <p>Referring to the app she used, Issie added: "I wanted to send my boyfriend an Animoji of me as a pig saying that I wanted a Chinese.</p>
      <p>"Well, I’ve sent it to my new manager and it’s the most idiotic video I have ever created."</p>

      <p>In the 18 second clip, Issie can be heard repeating the word "Chinese" in various funny voices.</p>
      <p>As she speaks, an animated pig graphic is seen mimicking her facial expressions.</p>
      <p>At the end of the clip she can be seen sticking her tongue out, which is copied by the animated pig.</p>
      <p>Issie realised instantly what she had done and hastily followed the message with a series of texts apologising to her new boss.</p>
      <p>She said: "Omg I'm so sorry that was meant for my boyfriend. I'm so sorry."</p>
      <p>Luckily, her boss saw the funny side and replied: "I hope he gets you one."</p>

      <p>She later posted a triumphant photo of herself with her meal with the caption: "Guess who got her Chinese finally."</p>
      <p>"I realised almost instantly that I made the mistake," Issie said looking back.</p>
      <p>"I was already talking to my boss about work so the conversation was already up.</p>
      <p>"I sent it and had a bad feeling in my gut that I had done something wrong.</p>
      <p>"Looking up I saw my boss's name and that’s when I realised I made a huge mistake.</p>

      <p>"My heart and stomach dropped! I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
      <p>"My boss was very understanding and said that it made her and her husband laugh a lot!"</p>
      <p>A number of people who saw the clip on social media saw the funny side.</p>
      <p>Ash Garbutt responded: "Proper laughed out loud at that, sending it to the new boss."</p>
      <p>Nicole Alice said: "I must have watched this about 20 times this morning hahaha I love it! Chinese!"</p>
      <p>And Rob Clark added: "That is quality."</p>
