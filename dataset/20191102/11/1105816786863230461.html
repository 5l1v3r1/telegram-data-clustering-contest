      <h1>Govt efforts to tackle 'Azadi March' gain pace</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T11:15:48+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/7761/news-2/" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>Government efforts to tackle the ongoing ‘Azadi March’ by the opposition parties gained pace on Saturday as the protest entered its second day.</p>
      <p>The government’s negotiating team met Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday at his Bani Gala residence to devise a future strategy.</p>
      <p>A discussion on holding another round of talks with leaders of opposition parties leading the protest was also reportedly held during the meeting.</p>
      <p>The premier also chaired a meeting of the ruling party’s core committee and discussed possible options to tackle the anti-government protest led by JUI-F Chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.</p>

      <p>Members of the negotiating team were also present during the meeting.</p>
      <p>National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser has also reached out to Awami National Party (ANP) leader Mian Iftikhar. The NA speaker requested a meeting to discuss the current political situation of the country.</p>
      <p>“I have told the NA speaker that after the Rehbar Committee’s meeting today, I will be able to respond to him,” said ANP’s Mian Iftikhar.</p>
      <p>The NA speaker told the leader to ensure that there is no violence, to which the ANP lawmaker responded, “we are against any sort of violence ourselves”.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the joint opposition demanded that Prime Minister Imran Khan and his administration resign within two days.</p>
      <p>Azadi march is the first concerted opposition campaign that the premier is facing since he won the general election last year.</p>
      <p>“I’m giving a two-day deadline for the resignation,” JUI-F’s Chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, told his rally of supporters in Islamabad yesterday.</p>
      <p>Thousands of JUI-F workers descended on the capital late on October 31 night after their five-day marathon journey which set off from Karachi on October 27.</p>
      <p>Security remains tight in Islamabad with the government and diplomatic sector – just a few kilometres from the rally site – sealed off, and roads blocked shipping containers.</p>
