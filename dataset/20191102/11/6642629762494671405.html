      <p>A heatwave has forced <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/malawi.html">Malawi's</a> constitutional court to suspend its requirement for lawyers and judges to wear traditional white wigs and black robes in the courtroom.</p>
      <p>Temperatures in some parts of the southern African country have hit 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) this week, the country's Department of Meteorological Services said.</p>

      <p>Malawi, a former British colony, still follows the UK legal system, with the wearing of wigs and robes a requirement for judges and lawyers.</p>
      <p>But Chikosa Silungwe, one of the lawyers in court this week in the capital, Lilongwe, said the heatwave was making the court's work challenging.</p>
      <p>"It's simple really. The heatwave this week meant that the gowns and wigs were uncomfortable," he said in a telephone interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
      <p>He was not ready to attribute the excessive heat to climate change, noting "that's stretching it too far".</p>
      <p>But Jolamu Nkhokwe, Malawi's director of climate change and meteorological services, said that while a range of factors contributed to higher temperatures, "the big suspect of this heatwave is climate change".</p>
      <p>"The (temperature) figures within their respective areas are higher than what is always expected during this time of the year," as the Southern Hemisphere heads toward summer, he said.</p>
      <p>Agnes Patemba, the registrar for the country’s high court and a judicial spokeswoman, said the lifting of the wig and gown requirement, which began on Wednesday, was a temporary measure.</p>
      <p>"There is a heatwave and that has compelled the court to indeed do away with wigs and gowns. It is not the first time this has been done," Patemba said in an interview.</p>
      <p>Malawi's high court is currently hearing a petition brought by the country's political opposition seeking to nullify this year’s elections, which it says were marred by irregularities.</p>
      <p>The country's ministry of health has issued a press statement warning of heat risks and urging people to take precautions.</p>
