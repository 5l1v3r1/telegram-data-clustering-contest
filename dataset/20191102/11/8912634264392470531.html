      <p>KABUL: An Afghan official says eight children have been killed by a roadside bomb near their school in the northeastern Takhar province.<br/>Sayed Mehraj Sadat, the provincial police chief, said the victims of Saturday’s attack were from 10 to 15 years old.<br/>He says the bomb’s intended target was most likely Afghan security forces, who often use the road.<br/>No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.<br/>Sadat blames Taliban insurgents who are active in Takhar province, particularly in Darqad district, where the attack took place.<br/>In October, the Taliban launched large-scale attacks in several districts, including the provincial capital Taluqan, which were repelled by Afghan security forces.<br/>Year-long peace talks between the US and the Taliban ended in September, after US President Donald Trump declared a seemingly imminent deal “dead.”</p>
