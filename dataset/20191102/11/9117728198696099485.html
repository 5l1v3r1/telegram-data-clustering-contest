      <h1>What is the weather forecast for the US Grand Prix?</h1>

        <b>The <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/united-states-grand-prix">US Grand Prix</a> gets underway at 14:00 local time and the race could see <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> crowned Formula 1 World Champion but what will the weather be like for Hamilton's inevitable coronation?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having been denied his sixth World Championship at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/mexican-grand-prix">Mexican Grand Prix</a> last time out after <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/valtteri-bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a> finished third, Hamilton will be hoping the results go his way this weekend and that he'll move a step closer to Michael Schumacher's record of seven World Championships. </p>
      <p>The odds are in the Brit's favour with Hamilton needing to finish eighth or lower for Bottas to take the fight to the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/Brazilian-grand-prix">Brazilian Grand Prix</a>. With <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a> both very much in contention, Bottas faces an uphill battle if he wants to deny Hamilton another opportunity.</p>
      <h3>The weather forecast</h3>
      <p>The sun is going to be out for qualifying and the race itself at the Circuit of the Americas. Qualifying is set to have a temperature of 19 degrees celsius, feeling 18. Whilst the race is slightly warmer at 20 degrees celsius. </p>
      <p>There is almost certainly going to be no rain in Texas and humidity levels are around 30%-35% all weekend.</p>
