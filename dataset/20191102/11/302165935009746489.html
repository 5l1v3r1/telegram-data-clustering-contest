      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 2 — PKR should focus on its agenda for the public and ignore any discontentment among party members, its president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said today.</p>
      <p><i>Malaysiakini</i> reported Anwar dismissing the internal discord as irrelevant.</p>
      <p>“We, in the party, should focus on the agenda of the people. The ‘ngok-ngek, ngok-ngek’ made by one or two, just let them be, [they are] not relevant,” he reportedly said at Kuala Lumpur PKR Convention, referring to the sound of discontent.</p>
      <p>Although he did not name anyone, it is believed that he was referring to his deputy Datuk Seri Azmin Ali and his faction. </p>
      <p>However, at the press conference later, Anwar reportedly clarified that he was just making a general reminder to all party leaders, and was not targeting specific individuals.</p>
      <p>Anwar also insisted that he has managed to get 90 per cent grassroots support after attending four state-level conventions in Sabah, Penang, Johor and Kelantan.</p>
      <p>“All the division heads attended the Johor [PKR convention] yesterday. One division [leader] was absent in Kelantan and the Federal Territories. The response in Sabah was also good,” he was quoted saying. </p>
      <p>“Where can you get 100 per cent [support]? When you are a division head, you can’t get it. This is the same when I am the party president. </p>
      <p>“Is this a problem? You have 90 per cent [grassroots members] supporting the party and the leadership. So, I am asking the 90 per cent of you to make the voice of the people as PKR’s voice,” he added.</p>
