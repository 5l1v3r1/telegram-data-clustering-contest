      <p>Yes, we are using the whole carrot and parsnip to make these <a href="http://go.theguardian.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmilkbarstore.com%2Fblogs%2Frecipes%2Fcompost-cookie&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/nov/02/liam-charles-no-waste-recipe-for-carrot-and-parsnip-cookies">compost cookies </a>– peel and all. The earthy root veg complements the sweetness of the cookie perfectly. Check it: they’re super-tasty.</p>
      <h3>Carrot and parsnip compost cookies</h3>
      <p>These are best eaten the day they’re made, but will keep for up to two days in an airtight container.</p>
      <p>Prep <b>30 min</b><br/>Chill<b> 30 min</b><br/>Cook<b> 20 min</b><br/>Makes <b>15</b></p>
      <p><b>350g plain flour</b><br/><b>100g oats </b><br/><b>½ tsp baking powder</b><br/><b>2 tsp mixed spice </b><br/><b>150g unsalted butter</b>, softened<br/><b>100g soft light brown sugar<br/>1 medium egg</b>, beaten<br/><b>2 carrots</b>, finely grated <br/><b>2 parsnips</b>, finely grated <br/><b>Zest and juice of 1 orange</b></p>
      <p>Put the flour, oats, baking powder and mixed spice in a large bowl. In another bowl, beat the butter, sugar and honey until creamy.</p>
      <p>Beat the eggs into the butter mix, then add the grated carrot and parsnip, and the orange zest and juice. Tip in the dry ingredients and mix slowly to form a dough.</p>
      <p>Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Flour your hands, then divide the dough into 15 balls, flattening each one into a thin disc with the palm of your hand: transfer to the tray and pop in the fridge to chill for 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Bake the cookies for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Leave on the tray to cool a little and firm up, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
