      <p>With event distribution concluded in all timezones, you may still need to know the contents of upcoming steps (assuming you haven't yet finished the quest).</p>
      <h4>Step 1/4</h4>

      <p>During the event hours, Regirock, Regice and Registeel will be found in high numbers as five-star raids – they will be your main target during this event, with the additional requirement of catching and evolving a number of Pokémon at each stage – Rock-type in this instance.</p>
      <p>(Advice upfront: you are going to need to have all three Regis for step four – so if possible, prioritise getting at least one of each with your extra raid passes).</p>
      <h4>Step 2/4</h4>

      <h4>Post-event alterations</h4>
      <p>We are anticipating a change to be made to the requirements (and potentially the rewards) for the quest once the free event concludes on November 4th. Please check back for more updates when further information is available.</p>
      <h4>How can I get Regigigas now that the event is over?</h4>
      <p>Significantly, Niantic have confirmed that <b>Regigigas will start appearing in the high-difficulty <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/10/guide_pokemon_go_ex_raids_-_what_they_are_and_how_to_get_an_ex_raid_pass">EX Raid series</a> ‘in November’</b>, meaning that there is still a <b>free route</b> to obtaining the Pokémon (though the premium pass gets your access sooner and far more easily considering the difficulty and selection criteria of EX Raids).</p>
      <h3>Free Event Details – November 1 to November 4</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="http://images.nintendolife.com/b68457a100ce3/regi-trio-event-official-banner.original.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>To accompany the release of ‘A Colossal Discovery’, <b>Niantic are running a commemorative event for all players</b>, focused around the Regi-Trio that Regigigas is considered the ‘trio master’ of. This will run from Friday, November 1 2019 at 13:00 to Monday, November 4 2019 at 13:00 PDT</p>
      <h4>Regirock, Regice and Registeel in 5-Star Raids</h4>
      <p>The legendary titans, commonly called the Regi Trio or ‘Regis’ will appear for everyone to catch in 5-star raids. In the mainline games these three Pokémon are usually involved in the process of catching Regigigas, hence their involvement in this event. Their types and <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/09/pokemon_go_type_chart_advantages_and_weaknesses_explained_for_all_18_types">type weaknesses</a> are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Regirock (#377) is pure Rock-type</b>, and weak to Fighting, Grass, Ground, Steel and Water moves</li>
        <li><b>Regice (#378) is pure Ice-type</b>, and weak to Fighting, Fire, Rock and Steel moves</li>
        <li><b>Registeel (#379) is pure Steel-type</b>, and weak to Fighting, Fire and Ground moves</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All three legendaries will also appear in shiny form for the first time.</p>
      <h4>Certain Pokémon Appearing More Frequently in Eggs and the Wild</h4>
      <p>Billed as Pokémon that are good counters to the Regi-trio, expect to see more Geodudes, Magnemites, Swinubs, Arons and Spheals in the wild. Aerodactyl, Shuckle, Sneasel, Skarmory, Snorunt and Beldum will be hatching more frequently in eggs.</p>
      <h4>Other perks:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Release of Shiny Skarmory alongside the Shiny Regis mentioned above</li>
        <li>2x incubator effectiveness</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>When Were Tickets for ‘A Colossal Discovery’ Available?</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="http://images.nintendolife.com/6cced223bf018/regigigas-official-premium-pass-banner.original.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Once the pass was purchased, players had to open Pokémon GO between Saturday, November 2 2019 from 11:00 to 19:00 local time to receive the ‘A Colossal Discovery’ Special Research quest. As with all Special Research quests, you can take as long as you want to complete the ’A Colossal Discovery’ story, though bear in mind that specific tasks may be more difficult as changes are made to the game through the year.</p>
      <p>In their announcement blogpost, Niantic recommended "trying your best to complete the research on Saturday, November 2, 2019, from 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. in your local time zone", "for an optimal gameplay experience".</p>
      <h3>How Much Did the ‘A Colossal Discovery’ Pass Cost and How Could I Buy It?</h3>
      <p>The ticket was priced at $7.99/£7.99 and for the first time, had to be purchased with real world currency (not the in-game currency – Pokécoins – which are partly available for free).</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="http://images.nintendolife.com/f3a82740cbd1d/regigigas-event-information-and-purchase-in-shop.original.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The tickets could be found in the in-game shop. In the main Poké-ball menu, hit ‘shop’ and scroll to find the ticket.</p>
      <h3>What Did ‘A Colossal Discovery’ Ticket Get You?</h3>

      </figure>
      <h4>Pass Exclusive Pokémon Release: Regigigas</h4>
      <p>The headline attraction of the ‘A Colossal Discovery’ pass was the release of Sinnoh legendary Regigigas through a special research quest. This quest was similar to those for <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/09/guide_pokemon_go_mew_-_a_mythical_discovery_special_research_walkthrough">Mew</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/09/guide_pokemon_go_celebi_-_a_ripple_in_time_special_research_walkthrough">Celebi</a> and <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/09/guide_how_to_get_jirachi_in_pokemon_go_step-by-step_advice_for_completing_la_thousand-year_slumberr_special_research">Jirachi</a>, aside from the fact that only those who purchase a pass could receive it.</p>
      <p>Regigigas (#486) is a Normal-type Pokémon. Therefore its sole type-weakness are Fighting-type Pokémon. It is resistant to Ghost-type attacks.</p>
      <h4>‘A Colossal Discovery’ special research rewards</h4>
      <p>As with all story quests you players accumulated items, XP, stardust and Pokémon encounters at each stage of the quest. See our ‘<a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/10/guide_pokemon_go_a_colossal_discovery_-_how_to_purchase_a_premium_ticket_and_regigigas_quest_walkthrough#how-to-get-regigigas-in-pokemon-go-n-la-colossal-discoveryr-walkthrough">A Colossal Discovery’ Walkthrough</a>’ section for more details.</p>
      <h4>Additional Raid Passes for Participants</h4>
      <p>‘A Colossal Discovery’ participants could receive up to 10 free Raid Passes when spinning Gym photo-discs for a limited period (normal rules apply in that you can only carry one at a time, but the daily limit of one free pass per spin was relaxed).</p>
