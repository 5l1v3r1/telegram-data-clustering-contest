      <p>NEW DELHI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Maisnam-Meiraba-Luwang">Maisnam Meiraba Luwang</a> lived up to his top billing as he clinched the boys' singles U-19 title at the Woncheon Yonex <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Korea-Junior-Open">Korea Junior Open</a> International Challenge 2019 in Miryang, Korea on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The top seed from <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manipur">Manipur</a> needed just 36 minutes to brush aside the challenge of 15th seed Lee Hak Joo of Korea in a 21-10, 21-13 win.</p>
      <p>Also claiming the bronze in the same category at this Junior International Challenge tournament was eighth seed <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sathish-Kumar-Karunakaran">Sathish Kumar Karunakaran</a>, who had bowed out to Luwang 16-21, 22-24 in a gritty semi-final contest on Friday.</p>

      <p>Luwang, who currently holds the No. 9 spot in the World Junior Rankings, was impressive throughout the week and dropped just one game in six matches. This is the 16-year-old rising star's third international title this year following his triumphs at the Russian Junior White Nights 2019 and India Junior International 2019.</p>
      <p>Luwang would especially be pleased with the way he rebounded after a disappointing exit from the World Junior Championships last month, where he crashed out in the Round of 64.</p>
