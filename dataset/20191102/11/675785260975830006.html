      <h1>Siya Kolisi lifts Rugby World Cup as South Africa defeat England to enjoy own momentous occasion</h1>
      <h2>ENGLAND 12-32 SOUTH AFRICA: Eddie Jones' side saw their Japanese adventure ended comprehensively by the Springboks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T11:45:18+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 11:45</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Dunn, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>To the millions watching back here at home, much of it was probably impenetrable, unfathomable.</p>
      <p>Jerome Garces was some sort of villain, according to social media, but the truth is the rules and intricacies of the game are fairly foreign to the casual sports-lover.</p>
      <p>If you knew the reasoning behind a quarter of the penalties awarded by Garces, count yourself a bona fide expert.</p>
      <p>And if you enjoyed the first three-quarters of this contest for its quality, you are a serious aficionado, someone steeped in rugby union’s attritional qualities.</p>

      <p>Let’s face it, before two magical, late <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/south-africa-rugby-union-team">South African</a> tries, this was a tough watch - and not just because England lost. And lost comprehensively.</p>
      <p>It was a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rugby-world-cup-2019">World Cup Final</a> in which most of the world did not have much of a clue what was going on for much of the time.</p>
      <p>Even those who at least thought a forward pass was a no-no might be scratching their heads.</p>
      <p>The interpretation of the laws will be the broader issue the sport’s governing bodies will have to consider when they have their debrief.</p>
      <p>But I’m sure those watching in South Africa were not obsessing with the referee.</p>

      <p>Nor should England fans.</p>
      <p>Their team was comprehensively outplayed in all departments and Warren Gatland was probably right when intimating their final was against the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/new-zealand-rugby-union">All Blacks</a> last weekend.</p>
      <p>And even for those watching who did not have much of an idea about the finer, subtler details of a superb Springboks performance, there was one clear joy.</p>

      <p>Rugby Union was a sport that once symbolised the evil of apartheid in South Africa.</p>
      <p>Now a black South African has captained his country to World Cup glory.</p>
      <p>That is why - for all the English disappointment, for all the chatter about the man with the whistle - it was still a momentous occasion.</p>
