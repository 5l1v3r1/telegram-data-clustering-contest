      <h1>Eddie Jones refuses to blame bus incident for England RWC Final loss</h1>

      <p>England head coach Eddie Jones has refused to blame a delay to his side’s bus journey to Yokohama for their lacklustre display in the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> Final.</p>
      <p>South Africa beat <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> 32-12 in the final at Yokohama <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals">International</a> Stadium in a game in which England struggled to get a foothold.</p>
      <p>The team’s official bus journey to the stadium was delayed by roughly a half an hour late, delaying England’s warm-up.</p>
      <p>“The effort of the players was outstanding. We just weren’t good enough today. Congratulations <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> on an outstanding performance,” Jones said immediately after the match. “Yeah, well we just struggled to get into the game, the effort of the players was outstanding but we just struggled to get on the front foot today.</p>
      <p>“I can’t fault the preparation of players who have worked hard the entire World Cup, I think they played with a lot of pride and passion. We just weren’t good enough today and congratulations South Africa on an outstanding performance.”</p>
      <p>“Japan’s put on a fantastic World Cup, it’s very well attended, the grounds have been terrific, the organisation’s first class so arigato gozaimasu (thank you very much).”</p>

      <p>Jones was also asked about the bus delay by ITV’s David Flatman.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got no excuses mate”.</p>
      <p>England captain <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/owen-farrell/">Owen Farrell</a> was equally devastated.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t start too well and probably had a disappointing first half but I am proud of this group. I’m proud of what we’ve done and how far we’ve come over the course of this tournament.</p>
      <p>“We showed that with the fight we had in the second half but credit to South Africa, they were very good today.”</p>
      <p>He was asked how much the team has grown during <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> 2019: “Yes, massively, and not just throughout that, but the time we spent together during the course of the preparation for this. I’m massively proud to be part of this team.”</p>
      <p>“I’d like to thank all the English support, back home and here – you have been unbelievable and the support means a lot. And, secondly, to Japan for hosting a fantastic tournament. We’ve loved it.”</p>
