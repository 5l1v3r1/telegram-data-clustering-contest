      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shah-Rukh-Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a> has always been fan favourite over the decades in the film industry. He has been ruling millions of hearts and has been crowned the 'King of Romance' by all his admirers.</p>
      <p>Today, as the actor celebrated his 54th birthday, a sea of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/fans">fans</a> gathered outside his house to make the day even more special. While many have flooded the internet with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/birthday">birthday</a> wishes for their favourite star, some other fans took things a step further by making a special <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/cake">cake</a> that is a work of art in itself. The cake bears a replica of Shah Rukh with out-stretched arms on his pedestal with Mannat in the background.</p>
