      <p>Katie Price has revealed that one of the highest points of her career was blighted by a terrifying health scare.</p>
      <p>In 2015 Katie silenced her critics when she became the triumphant winner of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity Big Brother</a> over nemesis Katie Hopkins.</p>
      <p>But speaking out in her YouTube channel, the Pricey has told how her redemption in the public eye was blighted by gruesome complications relating to one of her breast implants.</p>

      <p>Katie said she was almost ejected from the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> house the night before her win as doctors feared the worst.</p>
      <p>The glamour model turned vlogger spoke to fans on YouTube about her memories of being in the Big Brother house when she made the revelation.</p>
      <p>As she rewatched her exit interview with host Emma Willis, Katie said it took her back to how much pain she was in at the time.</p>

      <p>"The night before that they wanted me out of the house - the doctors and that - because my implant was hanging out," said Katie cupping her left boob as she spoke.</p>
      <p>"They had to check me every four to five hours because of my temperature. They said if my temperature went up I would have had to leave because I was going to get septicaemia in my blood.</p>
      <p>"I was really, really poorly," she added.</p>

      <p>Katie went on to say she'd been stunned to win the show because she felt she hadn't given producers that they wanted during her time in the house.</p>
      <p>"They thought I'd be feisty and argumentative and I'm not that kind of person," she mused.</p>
      <p>"Although if someone starts on me I won't take it. I'll stand up for myself," she confirmed.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/katie-price">Katie</a> said she was proud of how she behaved on the show - and for beating rival Hopkins into second place.</p>
      <p>"For once in my life I had dignity in that show. I kept myself together. I didn't show any boob or nothing. I was literally myself and wore tracksuits and was just myself."</p>
      <p>Pointing at Hopkins, Katie said: "But it must have been hard work for her thinking everyday, 'What trouble can I cause next? Who can I argue with next?'</p>
      <p>"That's not her. She's vile," said Katie.</p>

      <p>Former Page 3 girl Katie underwent her ninth boob job in August this year, despite swearing off surgery.</p>
      <p>She got her first implants at the age of 20 when she was breaking into modelling as a 32B cup size in 1998, followed just a year later with another op to take her from a 32C to a 32D.</p>
      <p>After the breakdown of her marriages to Peter Andre and Alex Reid, in 2012 Katie inflated her boobs to their biggest size ever - a 32F.</p>
