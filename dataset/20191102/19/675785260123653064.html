      <h1>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain explains how Liverpool training has changed since injury</h1>
      <h2>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain missed almost a year of action with a knee injury but is back playing in Liverpool's first team</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T19:56:02+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 19:56</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has described how his serious knee injury has forced him to change his training routine at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool.</a></p>
      <p>Midfielder Oxlade-Chamberlain missed 364 days of action after he damaged his cruciate ligament during the Reds Champions League semi-final first leg against Roma in April 2018.</p>
      <p>He only managed to make two appearances last season - 15 minutes in the Premier League off the bench - and has slowly been given more minutes by Jurgen Klopp this term.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> ace has made 10 appearances for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a>, along with an outing for England, and has netted three goals in his last three appearances.</p>

      <p>Despite appearing to ease back into the first-team at Anfield, Oxlade-Chamberlain has revealed how he has had to go for a pre-training warm up to make sure he is ready to put his body on the line.</p>
      <p>[Training's] changed," Oxlade-Chamberlain told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/lifestyle/article/alex-oxlade-chamberlain-goal">GQ.</a> "There are certain things that I have to make sure I look after.</p>
      <p>"I can’t just turn up and go and train now, I still have to get some treatment on my knee before going into the gym for pre-activation.</p>
      <p>"This helps to get myself fired up and be ready to go out and train.</p>

      <p>"Obviously, with a major injury like mine, you get back to playing but your body is still adapting.</p>
      <p>"So I still feel aches from time to time but I always make sure that I’m warmed up.</p>
      <p>"It’s the same with any long injury, it changes things, you just have to adapt to that."</p>
      <p>Last week, manager Klopp explained why Oxlade-Chamberlain hasn't been starting as many games since his return.</p>
      <p>"He has scored, nice, both at Genk, a real stunner on Wednesday, a lot of outstanding moments, but other moments he is not involved," the German said.</p>
      <p>"We always have to try to reach perfection. He still needs rhythm but that is no problem. He is a long-term project.</p>
      <p>"It is good a player thinks he is not at his best. He could think he is because he scored some goals. Quite some space for improvement. That is good.</p>
      <p>"Best shape ever before injury? He was exceptional."</p>
