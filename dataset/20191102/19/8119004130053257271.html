        <b>Four leaders of the BNP, including Sylhet Mayor Ariful Haque Chowdhury, have decided to resign from the party’s central committee following a dispute over the formation of a panel of its youth front Jubo Dal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Members of the party’s central committee Ariful and Shahriar Hossain Chowdhury, Micro-Credit Affairs Secretary Abdur Razzak, and Assistant Volunteer Affairs Secretary Shamsuzzaman Zaman announced the decision on Saturday.</p>
      <p>They alleged the party did not esteem devoted leaders of its affiliates while forming new committees.</p>
      <p>The four leaders from Sylhet said they would submit resignation letters to the party’s headquarters in Dhaka on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“The decision to resign is a form of protest against forcing decisions upon us by the centre without informing the grassroots. Self-sacrificing leaders are not being valued,” Ariful told bdnews24.com.</p>
      <p>He also said resignation from the central committee did not mean they quit the party.</p>
      <p>It would not be right if the BNP leaders protested against the government only, but not the wrongdoings inside the party, Shahriar said.</p>
      <p>More leaders would join their protests, he claimed.</p>
      <p>Those given posts in a recently formed committee of the party’s youth front in Sylhet are unknown faces who infiltrated the organisation, Razzak alleged.</p>
      <p>“None of the four of us know them even though we are active in party programmes,” he said.</p>
      <p>He also alleged a group in the BNP was out to damage the party by “misleading acting chief Tarique Rahman”.</p>
      <p>A convening committee of Sylhet Jubo Dal was announced on Friday after 19 years.</p>
      <p>Siddiqur Rahman, an expatriate in the UK, has been named convenor.</p>
