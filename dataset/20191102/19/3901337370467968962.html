      <p><b>Result:</b> Levante 3-1 FC Barcelona</p>

      <p>FC Barcelona failed to strengthen their lead at the top of LaLiga following a 3-1 defeat away to Levante on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Antoine Griezmann started for the Catalans, but Sergi Roberto and Arthur Melo came in for Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets respectively.</p>
      <p>Barca were off to a flying start at the midway point after Griezmann fired into the side-netting from outside the area following a through ball by Nelson Semedo.</p>
      <p>Barca went in front six minutes later when Messi drilled home his fifth strike of the season from the penalty spot after Semedo went down in the area.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde was forced to make a substitution four minutes to halftime after Suarez requested to leave the pitch to be replaced by Carles Perez.</p>
      <p>Barca made a tentative start to the second half as Messi, Griezmann and joined by Perez struggled to open up their hosts who defended strongly.</p>
      <p>Lapse of concentration drew the home side level when Jose Campana smashed home from close range 61 minutes in after the Catalans failed to eradicate a loose ball in the six yard box.</p>
      <p>Levante hit the front two minutes later when Camapana turned provider to Borja Mayoral, who eliminated the last line to finish beyond Marc Andre Ter Stegen.</p>
      <p>Barca however failed to prosper as Nemanja Radoja put the hosts further in front four minutes later when his shot wrong-footed Ter Stegen after coming off Busquets.</p>
      <p>Messi reduced the deficit on 75 minutes when he combined with Griezmann to find the bottom corner, but the Video Assistant Referee disallowed for offside.</p>
      <p>No frantic finish from either side cropped up, as Barca failed to open up a four-point gap over second-place Real Madrid, who now have the chance move top tonight.</p>
