      <p>BOSTON (AP) — David Pastrnak had a goal and two assists as the Boston Bruins beat Ottawa 5-2 Saturday night, in a game in which the Senators’ Scott Sabourin was taken to a hospital for evaluation after being taken off on a stretcher.</p>
      <p>Sabourin was taken from the ice with his head immobilized following a collision with David Backes in which the players’ helmets hit at nearly full speed early in the first period. Sabourin gave the crowd a “thumbs up” as he was taken from the arena.</p>
      <p>Patrice Bergeron, Brad Marchand, Danton Heinen and Jake DeBrusk also scored for Boston (10-1-2), which has lost just once in regulation this season. The Bruins have won five straight.</p>
      <p>Tuukka Rask made 30 saves for the Bruins, including eight when Boston was short-handed for six straight minutes.</p>
      <p>Anthony Duclair and Connor Brown scored for Ottawa. The Senators (3-8-1) have the NHL’s worst record with just seven points. Craig Anderson stopped 27 shots.</p>
      <p>After colliding with Backes, Sabourin fell to the ice and appeared to be unconscious. There was a large blood spot on the ice under his face.</p>

      <p>The Senators sent an update on their Twitter saying he was conscious and speaking with the attending doctors while leaving the arena.</p>
      <p>Backes went to the dressing after Sabourin was taken from the ice and didn’t return. The Bruins announced that Backes had an upper-body injury. He was visibly upset, fighting back tears, as medical personnel attended to Sabourin.</p>
      <p>Heinen scored 5:43 into the third period, hustling in for a loose puck, to make it 3-2.</p>
      <p>While on a power play, Pastrnak skated with the puck and looked as if he was going around the net before sending a pass in front to Marchand, who scored 1:07 later.</p>
      <p>Pastrnak’s power-play goal made it 1-0 just 1:17 into the opening period when he outskated defenseman Ron Hainsey to the puck after Boston defenseman Torey Krug sent a long pass that caromed off the backboards. Pastrnak shifted and tucked the puck behind Anderson.</p>
      <p>Duclair tied it on a one-timer from the right circle 12:04 into the period.</p>

      <p>Pastrnak set up Bergeron’s goal, making a soft pass across the crease, to make it 2-1 at 1:51 of the second, but the Senators tied it on Brown’s goal that caromed in off the heel of Rask’s stick at 3:04.</p>
      <p>Marchand was given two minutes for hooking and a double-minor for spearing at the same time early into the second and Rask was splendid.</p>
      <p>NOTES: It was Pastrnak’s first game since being named the NHL’s Player of the Month for October when he put up 12 goals and 12 assists. . Linesman Steve Miller was helped off the ice late in the game . The Bruins recalled F Peter Cehlarik from their AHL affiliate in Providence, Rhode Island, before the game. . Senators F Bobby Ryan was a healthy scratch for the second straight game.</p>
