      <p>Boston-bred emcee Latrell James has returned to bless our speakers once more, this time recruiting the talents of fellow artist Lilah to deliver on his newest "Vices" selection.</p>
      <p>The track arrives with a video to match as James floats over a backdrop crafted by producer Kiron. The clip comes courtesy of co-direction from the trio of Bianca Catbagan, Conor Simpson, and Marc Patterson. "Vices" follows up on the <i>Still</i> EP that James delivered back in July. It marked the first full-length outing from the seasoned multi-hyphenate since dropping his <i>Twelve</i> album in 2015.</p>
      <p>With a renewed output of tracks, however, the emcee seems to poised to deliver on a much more thorough and consistent stream of music moving forward. Get into the first taste of such an era via "Vices."</p>
