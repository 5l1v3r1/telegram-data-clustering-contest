      <h1>Bitcoin Looks Like a “Launchpad” as Analysts Anticipate Volatile November</h1>

      <p>Bitcoin has inched higher overnight after facing a short bout of consolidation within the lower-$9,000 region. BTC still has a long way to go before it revisits its recent highs of $10,600 that were set at the peak of the recent rally.</p>
      <p>Analysts are noting that the coming 30 days may prove to be highly volatile for the cryptocurrency, and one analyst believes that the crypto could be positioned for a massive upwards movement.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Inches Higher as Bullish Undercurrent Grows Stronger</h3>
      <p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/29/bitcoin-plunges-300-bearish-sentiment/">Bitcoin</a> is trading up just under 2% at its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">current price</a> of $9,320, which marks a slight surge from its weekly lows of just a hair above $9,000.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/28/bitcoin-btc-price-climbs-as-chinas-xi-jinping-embraces-blockchain.html">volatility</a> as of late has now resulted to it falling into a relatively tight trading range between roughly $9,000 and $9,500, with a significant amount of selling pressure existing between $9,500 and $10,000.</p>
      <p>Historically, November has proven to be a volatile month for Bitcoin, which could mean that the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/11/crypto-market-cap-and-bitcoin-could-rally-bch-ltc-eos-ada-analysis/">crypto</a> will incur some significant movements in the near-term.</p>
      <p>Big Chonis, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, spoke about the tendency for November to be a volatile month, explaining that BTC has either traded at $6,000 or $3,000 in November for the past two years.</p>
      <blockquote>“$BTC – November tends to be a volatile month of #bitcoin with a range the last two years of 6K and $3K respectively,” he explained while pointing to the chart seen below.</blockquote>

      <h3>Analyst: BTC Currently Looks Like a “Launchpad”</h3>
      <p>As for where this November volatility could lead Bitcoin’s price in the near-term, some analysts believe that the cryptocurrency is positioned for a massive upwards movement in the near-term as it breaks above multiple long-established resistance levels.</p>
      <p>The Crypto Dog, a popular <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/how-many-more-birthdays-until-bitcoin-wins">cryptocurrency</a> analyst on Twitter, concisely spoke about this in a recent tweet, saying “$BTC looks like a launchpad” while pointing to two long-established resistance levels that were formed in the time since its meteoric bull run that sent it surging from $7,300 to $10,600.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In the near-term, it is imperative that Bitcoin holds above the lower-$9,000 <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/15/technical-indicator-signals-bitcoin-may-rally-to-9300-next/">level</a>, or else its current bullishness could be invalidated, and further losses could be imminent.</p>
