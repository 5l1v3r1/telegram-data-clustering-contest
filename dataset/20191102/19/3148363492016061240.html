      <p>The latest campaign finance report issued on September 30 showed O’Rourke spent $13,965,478, according to <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/2020-presidential-race/candidate?id=N00033540">Open Secrets.</a> The former Texas congressman ended up with only about $3 million cash on hand. Final numbers for his campaign have yet to be released, but he likely surpassed $14 million in money spent the 30 days since his last report.</p>
      <p>Beto made a <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/03/18/2020-beto-orourke-raises-6-1-million-in-first-24-hours-beating-bernie-sanders/">big splash</a> after announcing his run for president by raising $6.1 million in the first 24 hours, but his early success faded as other candidates caught the imaginations of Democrat voters.</p>
      <p>The campaign spent $1.43 for every $1 it raised in the third quarter, according to the <i><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/11/01/beto-orourkes-previously-high-flying-campaign-reaches-abrupt-end/">Texas Tribune</a></i>, with payroll and related costs taking up the bulk of expenses. O’Rourke raised only $4.5 million in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>His campaign raised $17 million.</p>
      <p>“Though it is difficult to accept, it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully,” O’Rourke <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2019/11/01/beto-orourke-quits-2020-race/">announced</a> on Friday night, ending his campaign for president.</p>
