      <p>A Scots mum is fighting for her life after suffering a brain haemorrhage while on holiday with her pals in America.</p>
      <p>June Adams, from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dundee">Dundee</a> , was in Detroit when she was struck down by a Subarachnoid Haemorrhage and rushed to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hospitals">hospital</a> for emergency brain surgery on Monday October 28.</p>
      <p>Her children George, Scott and Ashley have all flown stateside to be with her.</p>
      <p>Daughter-in-law Jillian, who is married to son George, has since launched a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/charity">charity</a> drive to raise funds for the children to pay for accommodation while their mum remains in a US hospital.</p>
      <p>Initially looking to raise £5k, Jillian says she has been "totally overwhelmed" after the target was smashed within 24 hours of going live.</p>
      <p>  </p>
      <p>Writing on the GoFundMe page, Jillian said: "Sadly Monday 28th October, our Mother June Adams, whilst on holiday in Detroit with friends, suffered a Subarachnoid Haemorrhage and needed emergency brain surgery.</p>
      <p>"We are trying to raise funds to help support her 3 children, George, Scott and Ashley who have travelled from the U.K. to be there at her bedside to support their mother through this traumatic time.</p>
      <p>"As anyone knows who has travelled to the USA can appreciate how expensive flights, hotels etc are.</p>
      <p>"We would like to raise money to help support the family with their costs while they are going though this difficult time."</p>
      <p>Kind hearted fundraisers have given more than £6,500 in just 24 hours.</p>
