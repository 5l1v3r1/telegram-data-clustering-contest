      <h1>Metro Vancouver board endorses 8-lane replacement for Massey Tunnel</h1>
      <h2>Public consultation scheduled to take place in November and December, province says</h2>

      <p>Metro Vancouver’s board of directors has given their thumbs up to an eight-lane replacement project to fix the highly-congested <a href="https://engage.gov.bc.ca/masseytunnel/">George Massey Crossing</a>.</p>
      <p>The immersed-tube tunnel concept was endorsed by the board Friday following <a href="http://www.metrovancouver.org/boards/GeorgeMasseyCrossingTaskForce/GMA_2019-Oct-2_AGE.pdf#search=%22George%20Massey%20Crossing%20Task%20Force%22">recommendations put forward</a> by a task force dedicated to determining the next steps to fix the problematic bottleneck.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Other options looked at by the task force included a six-to-eight-lane bridge and a more expensive deep-bored tunnel.</p>
      <p>The approval marks a significant step in the years-long call by many Metro Vancouver mayors to fix the accident-prone crossing – a call to action met with a promise from the BC Liberals to be solved with a 10-lane bridge. But the Horgan government paused the project and ordered a third-party review before scrapping that option.</p>
      <p>The newly-endorsed tunnel project includes nine conditions to the B.C. government, including First Nations and environmental concerns and that the replacement be complete by 2026-27.</p>
