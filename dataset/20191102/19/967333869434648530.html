      <p>A video uploaded to Twitter recently shows a funny scene with a pilot who accidentally (as it appears) throws away his phone while attempting to take a selfie or make a film. After losing his device, the pilot looks really disappointed. However, viewers almost unanimously agreed that the pilot had not thrown anything away but rather did a trick and they explained how viewers could check it.  </p>
