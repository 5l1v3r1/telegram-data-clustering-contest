      <p>Kilwinning Rangers moved five points clear at the top of the West Premiership as Carlo Monti's stunning second half free-kick poleaxed Pollok at Newlandsfield.</p>
      <p>Former Lok favourite Monti found the top corner with a curling effort from just outside the box to make it four league wins on the spin for Chris Strain's side.</p>
      <p>It was a moment of magic in an otherwise edgy affair that saw few clear cut chances at either end.</p>
      <p>The hosts pushed hard for an equaliser in the closing stages but couldn't find a way past a resolute Buffs backline superbly marshalled all afternoon by centre-backs David Syme and Tommy Maitland.</p>
      <p>Kilwinning arrived in Glasgow with a two point advantage and game in hand over their rivals.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The pressure was on Pollok to perform and they made a bright start, Paul Gallagher forcing David Markey into an early save with a header from a deflected free kick.</p>
      <p>Kilwinning took time to find their feet, Monti dragging their first effort on goal wide of the post in 11 minutes.</p>
      <p>Two minutes later Ben Lewis' diving header from Dean Agnew's cross was brilliantly turned round the post by Lok keeper Josh Lumsden.</p>
      <p>Markey then came to his side's rescue with an equally fine stop to deny Chris Duff on the counter attack.</p>
      <p>Gary Fleming was next to threaten for the visitors with a driving run from midfield but his shot from 25 yards was wayward.</p>
      <p>At the other end, an Adam Forde free kick just cleared the crossbar before Gallagher tugged the last chance of the first half past the post.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Pollok started the second half strongly and in 49 minutes Markey made a tremendous block to keep out Iain Russell's close range effort after initially spilling a shot from distance.</p>
      <p>Buffs replied with an Alex McWaters free kick that was just beyond the reach of Mikey Hewitt at the back post.</p>
      <p>Other than that, there was very little in the way of goalmouth action until Monti made the breakthrough in 73 minutes.</p>
      <p>Kilwinning were awarded a free kick 22 yards from goal after Gallagher came through the back of Lewis and Monti steadied himself before beating Lumsden all ends up with a curling cracker into the top corner.</p>
      <p>Pollok threw caution to the wind in the final five minutes but the closest they came to an equaliser was a Shaun Fraser header that dropped the wrong side of the crossbar.</p>
