      <h1>Bernie Sanders Claims His Progressive Ideas Are 'Not Far Left'</h1>
      <h2>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) this week proclaimed that his ideas are not “far-left,” arguing that they are, in fact, what the “American people want.”</h2>

      <p>A clip surfaced on social media on Saturday featuring the socialist senator telling a crowd in Iowa that his proposals – which include Medicare for All, “free” college, and excessive taxation – are not “far-left.” Rather, they are “ideas that the American people want.”</p>

      <p>While it is true that Democrats tend to <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/08/28/poll-democrats-increasingly-favor-medicare-for-all-over-obamacare/">support</a> policies such as Medicare for All, that support does not necessarily translate to the general public.</p>
      <p>A Locust Street Group survey, commissioned by the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future in August, found that the majority of American voters, 64 percent, were not willing to <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/08/15/poll-64-percent-of-voters-unwilling-to-pay-more-taxes-for-medicare-for-all-or-public-option/">pay</a> more in taxes in exchange for Medicare for All – a proposal Sanders adamantly supports. Unlike his rival Elizabeth Warren, Sanders has openly <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/06/27/bernie-sanders-yes-middle-class-will-pay-more-in-taxes/">admitted</a> that his plan will require the middle class to pay more in taxes.</p>
      <p>Sanders announced on Friday that far-left “Squad” member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) will join him in Iowa to stump for the Green New Deal next weekend:</p>

      <p>The presidential hopeful unveiled his own climate change proposal in August, which <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/08/22/bernie-sanders-unveils-massive-16-trillion-green-new-deal-plan/">featured</a> a $16 trillion price tag.</p>
