      <p>Solihull Moors are aiming to make home advantage count again when they take on Dagenham &amp; Redbridge in the National League today.</p>
      <p>Moors hope to make it five league wins on the spin at the SportNation.bet Stadium this afternoon having beaten Stockport, Wrexham, Sutton and Bromley.</p>
      <p>In fact 21 of their 27 points so far this season have come at home.</p>
      <p>Their overall points tally matches that of today's opponents and boss Tim Flowers is expecting a challenging match.</p>
      <p>”It will be a really tough game, they’re a good side," said Flowers.</p>
      <p>"They’ve brought a few players in and they’ve got a very good manager in Peter Taylor.</p>
      <p>“Peter is a manager that I played for at Leicester. He’s a very decorated and experienced manager, currently doing an outstanding job at Dagenham.</p>

      <p>“We are looking to bounce back from last week’s very late defeat at Maidenhead and keep our impressive home league record going.”</p>
      <p>Moors exited the Scottish Challenge Cup in midweek after losing to Rangers Colts 4-3 on penalties after the tie ended in a 3-3 draw.</p>
      <p>Darren Carter is expected to be in the squad today after announcing his return from injury with a stunning free-kick goal in that match.</p>
      <p>Moors are ninth in the table, one place above today's visitors on goal difference.</p>
