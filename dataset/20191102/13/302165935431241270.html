      <p>GEORGE TOWN, Nov 2 — Police are tracking down a man for threatening to bomb the North-East District Police Headquarters (IPD), here using C4 bomb in an incident yesterday as he was angry with the authorities for frequently detaining suspects.</p>
      <p>North-East Police District Head ACP Che Zaimani Che Awang said that in the incident at about 3.30pm, the man contacted the Pulau Tikus Police Station and spoke to a policeman before suddenly cursing the policeman with various abusive words.</p>
      <p>He said that before putting down the telephone, the suspect threatened to explode the North-East IPD using the C4 as he wanted to see all the policemen die.</p>
      <p>Following the threat, he said a police team from the Bomb Disposal Unit (BDU) and the Tracker Dog Unit (K9) from the Penang Contingent Police Headquarters were sent to the North-East IPD for further checks but no bomb or explosive devices were found in the area.</p>
      <p>He said police were now tracking down the suspect concerned to assist in the investigation on the case. — Bernama</p>
