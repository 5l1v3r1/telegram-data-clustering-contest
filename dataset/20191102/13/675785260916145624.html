      <p>The Queen once held a religious service at Sandringham after servants said it was haunted, a royal biographer's diary has claimed.</p>
      <p>Kenneth Rose claims a "little service" was held in one of the downstairs bedrooms at the 18th Century mansion.</p>
      <p>The room - where The Queen's dad George VI lived during the months before his death - was said to be so haunted staff didn't want to work in it.</p>
      <p>The service in 2000 was held by a local parson and attended by the Queen, the Queen Mother and the Queen Mother’s lady-in-waiting Prue Penn.</p>
      <p>"Some of the servants had complained that the room was haunted and did not want to work in it," wrote Kenneth in his diary, which has been printed in the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7640869/KENNETH-ROSES-secret-diaries-Diana-Prince-Philip-revealed.html">Daily Mail</a> .</p>

      <p>"The parson walked from room to room and did indeed feel some sort of restlessness in one of them."</p>
      <p>Kenneth claims the revelation was made to him on January 2, 2001, although the service took place in summer 2000.</p>
      <p>"The congregation of three took Holy Communion and special prayers were said, I think for the repose of the King’s soul in the room in which he died," wrote Kenneth.</p>
      <p>"The parson said that the oppressive or disturbing atmosphere may have been because of Princess Diana: he had known such things before when someone died a violent death."</p>
      <p>Sandringham, which has more than 270 rooms, is where the Royal Family spend Christmas, with The Queen having spent every Christmas at the Norfolk mansion since her father's death in 1952.</p>

      <p>It's not the first time it has been reported Sandringham is haunted.</p>
      <p>In 2011, a courtier said: “Everyone believes there are ghosts because so many have ­experienced them, ­including Prince Charles. There are old parts of the house where nobody wants to go or be alone."</p>
      <p>Apparently, in the mid-1980s, Prince Charles was looking for some old prints with his valet Ken Stronach when they both suddenly felt very cold. They were convinced someone was ­behind them... but no one was there.</p>
      <p>Our shadowy source said: “After crying, ‘Oh heck!’, the Prince grabbed the first print and got out as quickly as he could. He was ­petrified.</p>
      <p>“There have been lots of incidents in the library. There is an old clock in there and the hands move by ­themselves.</p>
      <p>"There is a ­smaller part of the library where a servant once had a kip, only to be woken by books flying from the shelves.</p>
      <p>In 1996, footman Shaun Croasdale fled the cellar screaming after believing he saw the ghost of the Queen’s ­favourite ­servant, Tony Jarred, who had died a year ­earlier.</p>
