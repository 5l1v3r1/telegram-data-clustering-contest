      <h1>Video: Chinese MMA fighter KOs two kung fu ‘masters’ in 72 seconds</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T13:00:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tim Bissell</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/10/26/20932120/video-ko-wing-chun-master-ding-hao-xu-xiaodong-opponent-knocked-out-mma-ufc-china-news">Last week we reported that an MMA fighter named A Hu knocked out wing chun ‘master’ Ding Hao at a style-vs-style fighting event in China. </a>Apparently this isn’t the first time Hu has done this. It wasn’t even the first time he’d done it that night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.asiaone.com/china/chinese-mma-fighter-kos-two-kung-fu-masters-one-night-both-within-72-seconds">According to <i>Asia One</i>,</a> Hu fought two self-proclaimed kung fu masters that night; Ding Hao and Song De Cai.</p>
      <p>For the bout, Song was listed as 5’8”, 176 lbs and 44 years of age. Hu is twenty years younger, a little taller, and weighs 144 lbs. <i>Asia One </i>claims Song is a tai chi practitioner. Whatever Song is trained in it didn’t help him versus Hu, though.</p>
      <p>Check out the video of the bout below, provided by <i>Fight Commentary Breakdowns</i>:</p>

      <p>Despite being in his forties Song looked pretty spry to start the match, flying at Hu with a kick attempt. However, Song missed and landed on his rear-end. After that Hu landed a leg kick, defended against some wild punches, and then boxed his opponent into a corner.</p>
      <p>In the corner Hu landed half a dozen punches, which resulted in Song hitting the canvas. The referee then mercifully called an end to the action.</p>
      <p>After that fight Hu destroyed Ding Hao with a head kick KO. The total time of both fights came in at around 72 seconds. Here’s the demolition of Ding (also provided by <i>Fight Commentary Breakdowns</i>):</p>

      <p>This wasn’t the first kind of these fights for Ding, either. <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2018/3/24/17155186/video-mma-vs-wing-chun-xu-xiaodong-china-traditional-martial-arts-style-viral-controversial-news">Last year he was beaten up by Xu Xiaodong</a>; the man who started this recent craze of MMA vs. kung fu.</p>
      <p>Xu has been battling tai chi and wing chun stylists since 2017, when a social media argument escalated into a behind-closed-doors fight <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/5/7/15557868/feature-xu-bad-blood-throwback-mma-in-china-news-tai-chi-kung-fu-shaolin-weibo-ufc-asia">between Xu and a tai chi master named Wei Lei.</a></p>
      <p>Since then Xu has become a controversial figure in China, railing against <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2018/11/12/18076464/chinese-mma-fighter-xu-xiaodong-discusses-mission-expose-fakery-kung-fu-ufc-china-enbo-asia-news">the ‘fakery’ of kung fu </a>and challenging various masters to fights. As a result Xu has had his <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/5/25/15688560/china-mma-kung-fu-tai-chi-traditinal-martial-arts-feud-government-weibo-censorship-xu-wei-asia-news">social media accounts taken down on numerous occasions</a>, been successfully sued at the behest of the Chinese Wushu Association, and had <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/5/27/18641269/xu-xiaodong-ordered-apologize-pay-damages-after-insulting-tai-chi-grandmaster-mma-china-asia-news">his social credit rating demoted</a> to a level that prevents him owning or renting property and traveling on high speed transit.</p>
      <p>Despite the adversities he has faced, Xu continues to call out who he views as charlatans (<a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/8/25/20829998/xu-xiaodong-questioned-authorities-after-showing-support-hong-kong-protests-censor-mma-china-news">as well as speak up for protestors in Hong Kong)</a>. Xu’s next fight is expected to happen sometime in December.</p>
