      <p>Bale was heavily tipped to leave Los Blancos before the season got underway after a reported fall-out with Zidane, but nothing materialised.</p>
      <p>The Welshman worked his way back into the side, but has since picked up an injury while his future was once again in the news he was spotted travelling to London earlier this week.</p>

      <p>"The subject [Bale potentially leaving] is in the past. He is here and he's on the pitch, bit by bit, training," Zidane told reporters on Friday ahead of the Liga clash with Real Betis.</p>
      <p>"We're with him in order for him to get back in the team. Nothing more.</p>
      <p>"I don't have to do anything. I don't have to convince him about anything because he's here. He's training, he's still not available, but he's here at Real Madrid."</p>
