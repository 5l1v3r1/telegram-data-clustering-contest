      <p>Uber's <a href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/community/giving-back/community-impact/">Community Impact Initiative</a> now covers 12 metropolitan areas in North America. The ride-hailing giant has been giving out free rides to nonprofits through the program, particularly in instances wherein the lack of transportation becomes a barrier to opportunity. The program has been operating as a pilot in Portland and Seattle over the past three years, but now it will benefit 73 nonprofit organizations across 12 cities: Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Washington DC, Seattle and Portland in the US, as well as Calgary, Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver in Canada.</p>
      <p>Sarah Freed, Community Impact Initiative program manager, said in a statement:</p>
      <blockquote>"Too often, even in cities that have invested heavily in public transportation, there are mobility gaps when it comes to serving at-need communities. We can use our technology to help fill those gaps. In many cases, a simple, convenient ride to an important meeting or appointment makes a big difference in someone's life."</blockquote>
      <p>The company provides free rides to nonprofits through Uber for Business and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/01/uber-health-partnership-with-health-providers/">Uber Health</a> vehicles, which can take passengers to doctor's appointments. CII's recipients include women's shelters, domestic violence centers, cancer societies, groups for the visually impaired and YMCAs/YWCAs, among others. Uber says it donated $1.3 million in free rides and financial assistance under the program over the past three years, and it now intends to put $1.6 million more into the project.</p>
