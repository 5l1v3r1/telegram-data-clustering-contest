      <h1>Ireland ease to win over Namibia to claim third place in T20 qualifier</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T13:57:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 13:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Ireland eased to a 27-run victory over Namibia to finish third at the ICC T20 World Cup qualifiers in Dubai.</p>
      <p>Defeat to the Netherlands on Friday meant that Ireland – who had already sealed qualification for next year’s World Cup in Australia – would be forced to contest the third place play-off.</p>
      <p>Ireland failed to bat out their 20 overs, having elected to bat first, as they were bowled out for 135 with five balls remaining of their innings.</p>
      <p>Andrew Balbirnie top-scored by making 46 from 35 balls as Ireland posted a total which proved out of reach for Namibia.</p>
      <p>Spinner Simi Singh claimed three for 25, while Mark Adair, Gareth Delany and Boyd Rankin took two wickets apiece to bowl Namibia out for 108 in 18.2 overs.</p>
      <p>Holland – who have also already secured qualification for the tournament – face Papua New Guinea in the final this evening.</p>
