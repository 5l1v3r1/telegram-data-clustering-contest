      <p><b>Volkswagen</b> is making sure it brings appropriate ID when it visits the Petersen Automotive Museum this month – an <b>ID.</b> concept, that is.</p>
      <p>The company has announced it’s unveiling an all-new <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/volkswagen-id/">ID</a>. concept vehicle at the <i>Building an Electric Future</i> exhibit, set to open to the public on November 20.</p>
      <p>The exhibit is intended to show <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/volkswagen/">Volkswagen's</a> history and, according to its press release, “emphasise the brand’s plans to become the foremost producer of electric vehicles”.</p>
      <p>What better venue, then, to introduce a flagship electric sedan? That appears to be what Volkswagen is doing, the artwork accompanying its press release featuring the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/627785/volkswagen-i-d-vizzion-concept-revealed/">ID. Vizzion concept</a> that debuted at last year’s Geneva motor show.</p>

      <p>Unless the artwork is a red herring, the “all-new” ID. concept could be a new version of the ID. Vizzion, an enormous electric sedan measuring just 15mm shorter than a long-wheelbase <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/volkswagen-phaeton/">Volkswagen Phaeton</a> and longer even than Volkswagen’s current flagship sedan, the China-only <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/420773/volkswagen-phideon-new-china-only-limousine-revealed-in-geneva/">Phideon</a>.</p>
      <p>The ID. Vizzion concept was designed for Level 5 autonomous driving. It therefore has no driver’s seat, steering wheel or foot pedals, and little dashboard to speak of, its interior resembling a stylish lounge more so than a passenger car.</p>
      <p>Underpinned by the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/volkswagen-meb/">MEB</a> platform, it uses a dual-motor electric powertrain with all-wheel-drive and <b>225kW</b>. It’s said to be capable of <b>665km</b> of electric range under the less stringent NEDC combined cycle.</p>

      <p>Volkswagen has previously said the ID Vizzion previews a model slated to enter production by 2022, though not all of the concept's technology will be production-ready by that date.</p>
      <p>The company was also set to replace the Phaeton with an all-electric model, which may be one and the same.</p>
      <p>There’s one other possibility for this ID. concept debut. A <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/565635/volkswagen-working-on-sporty-electric-liftback-report/">leaked product roadmap</a> two years ago revealed the first six members of Volkswagen’s electric ID. family would include an as-yet unseen vehicle, the I.D. AEROe.</p>
      <p>This could be the rumoured electric successor to the Beetle, which – much like a brash flagship sedan – would make a great deal of sense for an exhibit on Volkswagen’s heritage and future.</p>
      <p>The exhibit at the Petersen will showcase how Volkswagen’s MEB platform was engineered and the variety of models it’ll underpin. Four existing ID. concepts will also be featured.</p>
