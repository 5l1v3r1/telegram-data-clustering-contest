      <p>Leather sofas, huge flat screen televisions, modern furniture and a swimming pool.</p>
      <p>Take a peek inside the plush home owned by Strictly Come Dancing head judge Shirley Ballas.</p>
      <p>Ballas will appear on the BBC One reality contest this evening, as the contestants continue to thrill us in their pursuit of the Glitterball Trophy.</p>
      <p>Shirley will be joined by her fellow judges - who include Craig Revel Horwood and Bruno Tonioli, as well as Motsi Mabuse - from 7pm.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old was met with a fierce backlash last week when she opted to send home Catherine Tydesley.</p>

      <p>Many viewers tuning into the BBC One favourite were left stunned as Shirley opted to give Cath the boot.</p>
      <p>The former Coronation Street star, known for her role as Eva Price on the ITV1 soap, departed on Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>She and professional partner Johannes were beaten in the dance off, somewhat controversially, by BBC star Mike Bushell.</p>
      <p>As Mike and pro partner Katya Jones were saved, Strictly viewers condemned Shirley over her decision.</p>

      <p>Many called for her to be sacked - and some took to Twitter and Facebook to demand a boycott.</p>
      <p>But when Shirley isn't in the studio judging, she's at home in London, where her modern, posh home serves her well.</p>

      <p>Shirley's property boasts a gorgeous living room, with relaxing settees, crushed velvet sofas, big flat screen TVs and bespoke shelving.</p>
      <p>She has dark hardwood floors that compliment the furniture and lines the walls with family photos, including school pictures of children she knows and snaps of friends.</p>

      <p>The judge has comfortable leather sofas, which are decorated with brocade print cushions, and her kitchen has a stunning breakfast bar with a marble top.</p>
      <p>The Strictly star even has an old fashioned clock and gothic style decorations on the walls, with glass tables in the dining room, a huge silver mirror looking over the seating area, and swimming pool and hot tub in the garden.</p>
      <p>Shirley previously told  <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/homes/gallery/2019102779290/inside-strictly-come-dancing-judges-houses/3/">Hello!</a>  magazine that she enlisted the help of interior design company The Sparkle Company to decorate her entire house.</p>

      <p>She had been living in Los Angeles but moved back to London permanently to work on Strictly.</p>
      <p>She told the publication: "When I got the Strictly job it made sense to come back to England.</p>

      <p>"It was quite difficult to commute back and forth, and I really wanted to build my charity work. I simply can’t do that if I am on the other side of the world."</p>
