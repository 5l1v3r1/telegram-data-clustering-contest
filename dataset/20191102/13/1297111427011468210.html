      <h1>Saskatchewan Roughriders eye the bye — with or without Cody Fajardo</h1>
      <h2>The Saskatchewan Roughriders might have to secure first place in the CFL's West Division without No. 1 quarterback Cody Fajardo on Saturday.</h2>

      <p>As the Saskatchewan Roughriders’ playoff plot thickened on Friday, quarterback Cody Fajardo made it clear that his oblique ailment is not the end of this story.</p>
      <p>It’s simply ‘to be continued.’</p>

      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-cannot-take-any-risks-with-cody-fajardo">Although it doesn’t sound promising for Fajardo to dress Saturday in a pivotal regular-season finale against the Edmonton Eskimos</a> (2 p.m., Mosaic Stadium), the Riders’ franchise quarterback put things in perspective when he stated that the looming CFL playoffs need to be his No. 1 priority.</p>
      <p>“There’s definitely a lot of risk to me playing in tomorrow’s game,” said Fajardo, whose team (12-5) can lock up first place in the West and a bye to the division final.</p>
      <p>“(Winning Saturday’s contest) is very important in terms of what we want to accomplish. The good news for me personally is this isn’t a game to get into the playoffs. We’re guaranteed a (home) playoff game, which is nice to know. Had this been a game where it’s do or die … I think I do everything I can to go out there. Knowing there’s a game after this, it changes.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/qb-cody-fajardo-tops-riders-depth-chart">Fajardo was hurt when he delivered a throw during non-contact drills in Wednesday’s closed practice at the University of Regina</a>. There was little advance warning other than some “stiffness” in his back <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-cody-fajardo-delivers-mop-calibre-performance-versus-edmonton-eskimos">following last weekend’s victory in Edmonton</a>.</p>
      <p>At the time, he dismissed it as wear and tear from a long season.</p>
      <p>It ended up being a lot worse.</p>
      <p>“It’s a pretty significant injury,” he revealed Friday. “I tried to throw (later) and it was significantly painful and it was tough to do just every-day tasks. A lot of my teammates don’t want me to play, which is nice to know that people care about my health more than my ability to go out there and win football games.”</p>
      <p>Fajardo would love to find an immediate solution, but he suggested this is one of those cases where the healing process can’t be expedited with treatment. It’s just a matter of time and patience, even though the latter is not something he has in abundance.</p>
      <p>If it was as simple as playing through pain, the Riders have no doubt he’d be out there.</p>
      <p>“He’s a tough kid,” said head coach Craig Dickenson. “It isn’t a matter of pain threshold with Cody. It’s just a matter of: Is he going to be effective throwing the football? Right now we’re not sure. It’s going to be a game-time decision.”</p>

      <p>As of Friday, the Riders’ most-outstanding-player nominee admitted he was in no shape to play a CFL game.</p>
      <p>Although he’s not completely ruling it out, that appears to be the direction it’s headed — barring a miraculous last-minute recovery.</p>
      <p>“If it was up to me I’d be out there playing but, honestly, I wouldn’t be effective if the game happened to be today,” said Fajardo, who expressed confidence that the Riders can prevail without him. “Whether I play or don’t play, that team is going to take care of business because we know what’s on the line. Even if I do play tomorrow, it’s not going to be easy because Edmonton is going to come in here and try to ruin our (first-place) party.”</p>
      <p>It’s quite a dilemma for Fajardo, who’s wary of suiting up when he might be better off saving his bullets. He also hinted that it’s the type of injury which could be exacerbated, thus removing him entirely from the playoff equation.</p>
      <p>“That has been going through my mind all week long,” he said. “I’ve had some pretty big significant injuries throughout the year (that he has played through) but this is the one that’s a scary injury. I wish it was something minor where I could just go out there and play with pain but the fact of the matter is I could play my last snap for the year if I go out there.”</p>
      <p>The Riders are expected to make a final decision on Fajardo’s status after he meets with Dickenson on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, they’ll play the waiting game.</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t feel very good today but he feels better than he did yesterday,” the head coach said. “We’re hopeful he wakes up in the morning and feels really well. I’m not overly optimistic but we’re going to wait until tomorrow. If he doesn’t feel like he can be an effective quarterback, we’re not going to play him. It’s really up to him.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/riders-backup-qb-isaac-harker-is-ready-to-go-if-needed">Dickenson confirmed that rookie Isaac Harker will get his first CFL start if Fajardo is ruled out</a>. Third-stringer Bryan Bennett is also expected to be mixed into the action, which would potentially allow the team to ride the hot hand.</p>

      <p>“We certainly don’t feel like we’re going to take a step back,” Dickenson said. “We know Cody has had a great year but if he doesn’t play we have confidence in Isaac and Bryan. We feel like, with the guys we have around those quarterbacks, we should be effective.”</p>
      <p>The Eskimos, whose playoff fate has already been determined, are expected to rest quarterback Trevor Harris and some others in preparation for their crossover semi-final date with the Montreal Alouettes.</p>
      <p>The Riders face much higher stakes, so they’re approaching Saturday’s contest almost like a playoff game. They also know that a win would give Fajardo an extra week to get healthy.</p>
      <p>“I think (the bye) is important just because everybody is tired at this time of year and everybody is a little beat up,” Dickenson said. “If you asked every team in the West, for sure they’d give their right arm to get that bye, but it doesn’t guarantee anything more than you play the next week.</p>
      <p>“We want to win this game and we’re going to put our best team out there. If it’s with Cody, great. If it’s not, we’ll put our best team out there without him.”</p>
      <p><b>NOTE</b>: Linebacker Derrick Moncrief (hip-flexor, shoulder) will be replaced in Saturday’s lineup by versatile DB Loucheiz Purifoy. Dickenson said Moncrief might have been able to dress in a playoff scenario but it’s hoped that some extra rest will get him “close to 100 per cent” for the post-season.</p>
