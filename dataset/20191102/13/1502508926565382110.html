      <h1>Khattar requests Javadekar to convene CM's meet on Delhi-NCR pollution</h1>
      <h2>'The ongoing public health emergency in NCR is a matter of serious concern for all of us,' Haryana CM Khattar said</h2>

      <p>Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday wrote to Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar requesting him to convene a meeting of chief ministers of Delhi and neighbouring states to prepare a joint strategy to address the problem of severe pollution in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">National </a>Capital Region.</p>
      <p>Without naming anyone, Khattar also criticised the "growing tendency" on the part of some stakeholders to "play petty politics" on the issue. The chief minister, in a telephonic conversation with Javadekar earlier in the day, requested him to convene a meeting, preferably on Sunday, to prepare a well thought-out strategy that would synergise the efforts of different organisations and the governments in the region.</p>
      <p>"The ongoing public health emergency in NCR is a matter of serious concern for all of us," he said.</p>

      </p>
      <p>To alleviate the suffering of people, there is a need for coordinating the efforts of all the stakeholders to tackle the issue in a more sensitive and responsible manner, Khattar said in an official statement.</p>
      <p>He said as no single person, organisation or government can improve the quality of air in the NCR, "playing politics" on this serious situation is unfortunate and, in itself, a matter of concern.</p>
      <p>Following up his conversation with a letter, Khattar said the meeting of all chief ministers and environment ministers of the states concerned would help evolve an actionable plan and a joint strategy to address the serious situation and to mitigate the suffering and hardships of people.</p>
      <p>Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had claimed that Delhi had turned into a "gas chamber" due to smoke arising out of crop burning in Punjab and Haryana.</p>
