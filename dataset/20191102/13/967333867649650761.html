      <p>Turkey will send the Daesh* prisoners it has captured back to their home countries, the country's Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said.</p>
      <p>The minister also said that Turkey won't accept Europe's inaction on the issue of Daesh* prisoners when Turkey is left alone to deal with them. </p>
      <blockquote>"That is not acceptable to us. It's also irresponsible," Soylu said. </blockquote>
      <p>Turkey has captured some escaped <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911011077202768-US-Looking-Into-New-Daesh-Leader-His-Role-Where-He-Came-From-State-Dept/">Daesh</a>* prisoners in northeastern Syria during its Operation Peace Spring which started on 9 October. Ankara said the operation was essential to oust Kurdish militants and Daesh* fighters from the border area and establish a security zone for Syrian refugees there. </p>
