      <h2>Nate Diaz and Jorge Masvidal clash for the BMF belt at UFC 244 at Madison Square Garden in New York</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T13:00:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Nate Diaz returns to the Octagon for the second time in three months tonight when he takes on Jorge Masvidal at UFC 244.</p>
      <p>The Stockton native was out of action for three years following his defeat by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> , but returned in August to beat Anthony Pettis.</p>
      <p>He then called out Masvidal - who has recorded stunning back-to-back victories over Darren Till and Ben Askren - and the fight was quickly made.</p>
      <p>The pair will clash tonight at Madison Square Garden in New York and on the line will be the one-off Baddest Motherf***** belt which has been specially designed and produced.</p>
      <p>On hand to present the belt will be none other than Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson while the main event will be preceded by Till's middleweight debut against Kelvin Gastelum.</p>
      <p>Here is everything you need to know about tonight's fights...</p>

      <h3>Latest news</h3>
      <p>Nate Diaz remains open to a trilogy fight with Conor McGregor - but is not desperate to face the Irishman again.</p>
      <p>Diaz choked out McGregor in 2016 before losing their rematch six months later by decision.</p>
      <p>He then sat out for three years before returning in August to beat Anthony Pettis to set up Saturday’s  clash with Jorge Masvidal at UFC 244.</p>
      <p>McGregor meanwhile went on to beat Eddie Alvarez to win the lightweight title but then suffered defeats by Floyd Mayweather and Khabib Nurmagomedov.</p>
      <p>The Dubliner is pencilled in to return to the UFC on January 18 against Donald Cerrone and wants to then face the winner of Diaz vs Masvidal.</p>
      <p>But of a trilogy fight, Diaz said: “Maybe, maybe not, I don’t know what’s next.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to do what I’m going to do. We’ll see what’s going to happen in the future. Like I said before, when the stars line up. I don’t know what’s next. I’m going to try to make this fight happen the way it’s supposed to happen, and we’ll go from there.</p>
      <p>“Whatever is going to happen in the future is going to happen in the future."</p>
