      <p>Consumers will be in for the second consecutive month of successive price rollbacks with petroleum products expected to have marginal cost reductions next week, according to the estimates of industry players.</p>
      <p>As initially assessed based on the outcome of four-day trading in the world market, gasoline prices will likely be rolled back by P0.25 to P0.35 per liter; and diesel by P0.10 to P0.20 per liter.</p>
      <p>The oil companies, being their usual course, will be adjusting prices by Tuesday (November 5) based on their final estimated price adjustments.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which is the cooking fuel commodity for most households, will be higher for this month of November.</p>
      <p>Leading oil firm Petron Corporation announced LPG price increase of P0.30 per kilogram for its Gasul brand effective November 1 (Friday) at 12:01 am; while its autoLPG for vehicles had gone up by P0.20 per liter.</p>
      <p>Its competitor Isla LPG, which carries the Solane brand, has already jacked up its price by P0.24 per kilogram (exclusive of value added tax) effective November 1 at 6 a.m.</p>
