      <p>“Fourteen seasons and when I left crazy Arnold took over,” Trump said, referring to Schwarzenegger’s <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2017/03/03/arnold-schwarzenegger-quits-celebrity-apprentice-one-season-cites-shows-baggage/">short run</a> on <i>Celebrity Apprentice</i>.</p>
      <p>Trump reminisced about the show during a political rally on Friday night in Mississippi.</p>
      <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger replaced Trump in the show and delivered the line “you’re terminated” to replace Trump’s famous line “You’re fired” but it only lasted one season.</p>
      <p>“It didn’t do too well, it was dead,” Trump said. “It was dead from the first episode, I saw him and I said ‘It’s terrible! What have they done to this beautiful show? Arnold!”</p>
      <p>Schwarzenegger is back in the news as a star in the movie <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i>.</p>
      <p>When asked about Trump, he told <i><a href="https://amp.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/30/terminator-dark-fate-arnold-schwarzenegger-trump-diapers-interior-design/2500036001/">USA Today </a></i>that he chose his battles with the president carefully even when he disagreed with what Trump was doing in office.</p>
      <p>“I’m not positioning myself to be critic of Trump, only when it’s obvious,” Schwarzenegger said. “That’s why you don’t hear from me for months, even if I don’t like what’s going on.”</p>
      <p>Schwarzenegger even said that he hoped that Trump would see his new Terminator movie.</p>
      <p>“I hope the whole White House goes and sees the movie,” he says. “Because we’ll sell more tickets this way.”</p>
