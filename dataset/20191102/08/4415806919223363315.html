      <p>A Status Yellow rainfall warning has been issued for five counties today.</p>
      <p>Met Ã‰ireann has issued the warning for Galway, Mayo, Clare, Kerry and Limerick.</p>
      <p>According to the forecaster, there will be spells of rain during Saturday with further accumulations of up to 20mm possible, especially in upland areas.</p>
      <p>The warning came into effect at 8am this morning and remains in place until midnight.</p>
      <p>Today will be mostly wey across Connacht, Munster and parts of south Leinster with heavy rain at times and strong northwest winds - especially in coastal counties.</p>
      <p>Eastern and northeastern counties will start mostly dry with bright spells developing.</p>

      <p>Later in the morning and in the afternoon, showers and long spells of rain will affect these areas.</p>
      <p>There will be further rain in many areas early tonight but these will break up into showers.</p>
      <p>Drier, clearer weather will develop especially across Ulster.</p>
      <p>It will be a dry start for parts of Ulster and Leinster tomorrow morning while there will be showery rain in parts of the west and southwest.</p>
      <p>This will travel eastwards in the afternoon and evening, drying out in the west before a heavier spell of rain moves in off the Atlantic after dark.</p>
      <p>There is also a small craft warning and a number of orange gale warnings for Irish coastal waters.</p>
      <p>The RNLI's head of water safety, Gareth Morrison, says it is wise to be cautious.</p>
      <p>"The advice from the RNLI is simple: if you see anybody in difficulty dial 999 and contact the coastguard," said Mr Morrison.</p>
      <p>"Do not attempt any sort of rescue yourself."</p>
