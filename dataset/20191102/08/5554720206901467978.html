      <p>Civil Servants for the East India Company used to be nominated by the Directors<br/>of the Company and thereafter trained at Haileybury College in London and then sent to<br/>India. Following Lord Macaulay’s Report of the Select Committee of British Parliament,<br/>the concept of a merit based modern Civil Service in India was introduced in 1854. The<br/>Report recommended that patronage based system of East India Company should be<br/>replaced by a permanent Civil Service based on a merit based system with entry<br/>through competitive examinations. For this purpose, a Civil Service Commission was<br/>setup in 1854 in London and competitive examinations were started in 1855. Initially,<br/>the examinations for Indian Civil Service were conducted only in London. Maximum age<br/>was 23 years and minimum age was 18 years. The syllabus was designed such that<br/>European Classics had a predominant share of marks. All this made it difficult for Indian<br/>candidates. Nevertheless, in 1864, the first Indian, Shri Satyendranath Tagore brother<br/>of Shri Rabindaranath Tagore succeeded. Three years later 4 other Indians succeeded.<br/>Throughout the next 50 years, Indians petitioned for simultaneous examinations to be<br/>held in India without success because the British Government did not want many<br/>Indians to succeed and enter the ICS. It was only after the First World War and the<br/>Montagu Chelmsford reforms that this was agreed to. From 1922 onwards the Indian<br/>Civil Service Examination began to be held in India also, first in Allahabad and later in<br/>Delhi with the setting up of the Federal Public Service Commission. The Examination in<br/>London continued to be conducted by the Civil Service Commission.</p>
      <p>Similarly, prior to independence superior police officers belonged to the Indian (Imperial)<br/>Police appointed by the Secretary of State by competitive examination. The first open<br/>competition for the service was held in England in June, 1893, and 10 top candidates<br/>were appointed as Probationary Assistant Superintendents of Police. Entry into Imperial<br/>Police was thrown open to Indians only after 1920 and the following year examinations<br/>for the service were conducted both in England and India. Indianisation of the police<br/>service continued to be very slow despite pronouncement and recommendations of the<br/>Islington Commission and the Lee Commission. Till 1931, Indians were appointed<br/>against 20% of the total posts of Superintendents of Police. However, because of non<br/>availability of the suitable European candidates, more Indians were appointed to the<br/>Indian Police from the year 1939 onwards.</p>
      <p>Regarding Forest Service, British India Government started the Imperial Forest<br/>Department in 1864 and to organize the affairs of the Imperial Forest Department,<br/>Imperial Forest Service was constituted in 1867. From 1867 to 1885, the officers<br/>appointed to Imperial Forest Service were trained in France and Germany. Till 1905,<br/>they were trained at Coopers Hill, London. In 1920, it was decided that further<br/>recruitment to the Imperial Forest Service would be made by direct recruitment in<br/>England and India and by promotion from the provincial service in India. After<br/>independence, the Indian Forest Service was created in 1966 under All India Service<br/>Act 1951.</p>
      <p>Regarding Central Civil Services, the Civil Services in British India were classified as<br/>covenanted and uncovenanted services on the basis of the nature of work, pay-scales<br/>and appointing authority. In 1887, the Aitchinson Commission recommended the reorganization of the services on a new pattern and divided the services into three<br/>groups-Imperial, Provincial and Subordinate. The recruiting and controlling authority of<br/>Imperial services was the ‘Secretary of State’. Initially, mostly British candidates were<br/>recruited for these services. The appointing and controlling authority for Provincial<br/>services was the respective provincial government, which framed rules for these<br/>services with the approval of the Government of India. With the passing of the Indian<br/>Act 1919, the Imperial Services headed by the Secretary of State for India, were split<br/>into two-All India Services and Central Services. The central services were concerned<br/>with matters under the direct control of the Central Government. Apart from the Central<br/>Secretariat, the more important of these services were the Railway Services, the Indian<br/>Posts and Telegraph Service, and the Imperial Customs Service. To some of these, the<br/>Secretary of State used to make appointments, but in the great majority of cases their<br/>members were appointed and controlled by the Government of India.</p>
      <p>The origin of the Public Service Commission in India is found in the First<br/>Dispatch of the Government of India on the Indian Constitutional Reforms on the 5th<br/>March, 1919 which referred to the need for setting up some permanent office charged<br/>with the regulation of service matters. This concept of a body intended to be charged<br/>primarily with the regulation of service matters, found a somewhat more practical shape<br/>in the Government of India Act, 1919. Section 96(C) of the Act provided for the<br/>establishment in India of a Public Service Commission which should “discharge, in<br/>regard to recruitment and control of the Public Services in India, such functions as may<br/>be assigned thereto by rules made by the Secretary of State in Council”.<br/>After passing of the Government of India Act, 1919, in spite of a prolonged<br/>correspondence among various levels on the functions and machinery of the body to be<br/>set up, no decision was taken on setting up of the body. The subject was then referred<br/>to the Royal Commission on the Superior Civil Services in India (also known as Lee<br/>Commission). The Lee Commission, in their report in the year 1924, recommended that<br/>the statutory Public Service Commission contemplated by the Government of India Act,<br/>1919 should be established without delay.</p>
      <p>Subsequent to the provisions of Section 96(C) of the Government of India Act,<br/>1919 and the strong recommendations made by the Lee Commission in 1924 for the<br/>early establishment of a Public Service Commission, it was on October 1, 1926 that the<br/>Public Service Commission was set up in India for the first time. It consisted of four<br/>Members in addition to the Chairman. Sir Ross Barker, a member of the Home Civil<br/>Service of the United Kingdom was the first Chairman of the Commission.<br/>The functions of the Public Service Commission were not laid down in the<br/>Government of India Act, 1919, but were regulated by the Public Service Commission<br/>(Functions) Rules, 1926 framed under sub-section (2) of Section 96(C) of the<br/>Government of India Act, 1919. Further, the Government of India Act, 1935 envisaged a<br/>Public Service Commission for the Federation and a Provincial Public Service<br/>Commission for each Province or group of Provinces. Therefore, in terms of the<br/>provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935 and with its coming into effect on 1st<br/>April, 1937, the Public Service Commission became the Federal Public Service<br/>Commission.</p>
      <p>With the inauguration of the Constitution of India in January 26, 1950, the<br/>Federal Public Service Commission came to be known as the Union Public Service<br/>Commission, and the Chairman and Members of the Federal Public Service<br/>Commission became Chairman and Members of the Union Public Service Commission<br/>by virtue of Clause (1) of Article 378 of the Constitution.</p>
