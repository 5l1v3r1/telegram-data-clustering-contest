      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Indonesian rider Afridza Munandar has died after a crash at a MotoGP support race in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>He was 20.</p>
      <p>The International Motorcycling Federation says Munandar died at Kuala Lumpur Hospital in the Malaysian capital on Saturday after being airlifted from the Sepang track.</p>
      <p>Munandar was racing in the Asia Talent Cup, where he was a title contender.</p>
      <p>The race was immediately stopped after the first-lap incident.</p>
      <p>Munandar’s death comes three years after Spanish rider Luis Salom died from injuries sustained in a crash in Moto2 practice in Spain.</p>
      <p>MotoGP rider Marco Simoncelli died after an incident at the Sepang circuit in 2011 when he fell and was struck by two other riders’ bikes.</p>
