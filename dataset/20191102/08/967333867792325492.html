      <p>An unbelievable picture shows adventurer Sarah Rodgers photographed in front of the colossal ice field.</p>
      <p>The glacier is so huge that she can barely be seen.</p>
      <p>The photo was <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B342P8ABiF_/">made by Jack Anstey</a> a friend of Sarah Rodgers.</p>
      <blockquote>“When we saw the glacier, Sarah and I both got out the car and walked in other directions,” Jack said.</blockquote>
      <p>“This image was taken from about 1km [0.6 miles] away on a big zoom lens; I wanted to capture the scale of the glacier so I radioed to Sarah and asked her to stand there for context,” he added.</p>
