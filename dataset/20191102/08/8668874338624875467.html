      <p>Glasgow’s returning World Cup players helped them to a much-improved performance and a 50-0 win over Southern Kings.</p>
      <p>The Warriors controlled play from the start with the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/kings">Kings</a> looking distinctly unimpressed by a cold and wet evening at Scotstoun.</p>
      <p>Glasgow raced to the try bonus in 28 minutes through <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow/players/grant-stewart/">Grant Stewart</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow/players/matt-fagerson/">Matt Fagerson</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow/players/callum-gibbins/">Callum Gibbins</a> and Oli Kebble. Niko Matawalu added a spectacular effort and with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland/players/adam-hastings/">Adam Hastings</a> kicking two conversions the Warriors led 29-0 at the break.</p>
      <p>Second-half scores from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland/players/zander-fagerson/">Zander Fagerson</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow/players/ratu-tagive/">Ratu Tagive</a> were both converted by Hastings, with a penalty try helping swell the scoreline.</p>
      <p>The first quarter of the game was played almost entirely in the Kings’ half as the Warriors, benefiting hugely from having their <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland">Scotland</a> stars back, marched towards their bonus point.</p>
      <p>The first score came in the 10th minute with a lineout drive providing the base for hooker Stewart to dart over.</p>
      <p>Next, a typically sharp break from scrum-half <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland/players/george-horne/">George Horne</a> took him to the line with flanker <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow/players/matt-fagerson/">Matt Fagerson</a> getting over.</p>
      <p>Stand-off Hastings was running things and his penalty to the corner set up the pack to drive over with captain Gibbins touching down.</p>
      <p>In the 23rd minute Kings captain Ruaan Lerm was sin-binned for a dangerous ruck entry and almost immediately Glasgow’s South African prop Kebble ran straight from 15 metres for the fourth try.</p>
      <p>The fifth was a spectacular one from fans’ favourite Matawalu. Fed with a long pass by Hastings in his own half, he kicked long and got to the ball first to scoop up at speed prior to scoring.</p>
      <p>Before the break, Kings picked up a second yellow card with winger S’bura Sithole the offender and Coyi Banda missed a penalty into the tricky wind.</p>
      <p>The second half started with a long pause as Kings centre Erich Cronje was treated initially on the field for a head injury.</p>
      <p>Glasgow winger <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow/players/dth-van-der-merwe/">DTH Van Der Merwe</a> almost reached the line but prop <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow/players/zander-fagerson/">Zander Fagerson</a> completed the move and further points followed from Tagive, the penalty try and two Hastings conversions.</p>
