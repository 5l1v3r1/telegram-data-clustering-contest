      <p>GRENOBLE, France (AP) — Nathan Chen has secured qualification for the figure skating Grand Prix finals with victory at the Internationaux de France.</p>
      <p>The world champion made errors landing three of his four quadruple jumps in Saturday’s free skate but still had a total of 297.16 points. That was more than enough for the American to claim his eighth consecutive win in Grand Prix events.</p>
      <p>Russian Alexander Samarin took second, a full 32 points behind Chen on 265.10, and France’s Kevin Aymoz claimed his first Grand Prix medal with bronze on 254.64.</p>
      <p>Olympic silver medalist Shoma Uno finished eighth after falling five times in his two skates. It was his worst placing in senior international competition.</p>
      <p>The Japanese skater was thoroughly out of sorts Saturday, landing just two of his seven jumps and combinations cleanly.</p>
