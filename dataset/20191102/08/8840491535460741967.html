      <p>CASTLEBAR, Mayo's county town, is celebrating its first GAA All-Star award.</p>
      <p>It was presented last night to 25-year-old Castlebar Mitchels ace Patrick Durcan for his accomplished performances for Mayo throughout the 2019 season.</p>
      <p>He was chosen at No. 5 in the half-back line in a team dominated by All-Ireland champions Dublin.</p>
      <p>Durcan was singled out for being so adept at launching attacks as well as being so solid defensively.</p>
      <p>The adjudication panel also described him as one of the sport's most consistent performers.</p>
      <p>A statement issued by his club, Castlebar Mitchels, said it was very proud of Patrick's achievements.</p>
