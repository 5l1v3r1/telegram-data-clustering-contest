      <p>SEPANG, Nov 2 — Petronas Yamaha rookie Fabio Quartararo smashed the lap record at the Sepang International Circuit to earn his team a home pole position for tomorrow’s Malaysian Grand Prix, while MotoGP world champion Marc Marquez suffered a nasty crash.</p>
      <p>Quartararo's one minute 58.303 seconds lap helped him finish ahead of Maverick Vinales (1:58.406), with Franco Morbidelli completing the Yamaha front-row lockout.</p>
      <p>Marquez, who sewed up his sixth MotoGP title and fourth in a row in Thailand last month, spent much of the session trailing Quartararo before suffering a massive highside entering Turn 2.</p>
      <p>The Honda rider crashed and walked away gingerly after the accident and will start 11th, his worst qualifying performance since the 2015 Italian Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>Marquez off his back, Quartararo came up with a blinding lap with two minutes to go and smashed his visor in celebration.</p>
      <p>Pramac Ducati rider Jack Miller will start fourth with LCR Honda's Cal Crutchlow and Yamaha's Italian great Valentino Rossi joining him in the second row.</p>
      <p>Triple MotoGP champion Jorge Lorenzo of Repsol Honda will start 18th after going more than a second short of the Q1 pace.</p>
      <p>Marquez extended his championship lead to an unbeatable 375 points with two races remaining, in Malaysia and on home soil in Valencia. — Reuters</p>
