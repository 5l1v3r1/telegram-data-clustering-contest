      <p>The first Spider-Verse film beat off competition from Disney challengers Incredibles 2 and Ralph Breaks The Internet to take the best animated feature at the Oscars earlier this year.</p>
      <p>It featured the voice of Shameik Moore as Afro-Latino teenager Miles Morales, and featured several different versions of the web-slinging superhero.</p>

      <p>Penned by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who were also responsible for the recent 21 Jump Street movies, it also featured the voices of Mahershala Ali, Jake Johnson, Brian Tyree Henry and Hailee Steinfeld.</p>
