      <p>World Rugby referee Nigel Owens has opened up on his experience at the 2019 <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> while revealing the heartwarming gesture made by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a> captain <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/crusaders/players/kieran-read/">Kieran Read</a> which left him in tears.</p>
      <p>In a column for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> Online, Owens reflected on the past eight weeks in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> ahead of his duties as fourth official during tonight’s final between <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> in Yokohama.</p>
      <p>Along with praising the World Cup as a “brilliant” edition of the tournament, Owens, who officiated last week’s semifinal between the All Blacks and England, said it was a gesture made by Read and England captain <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/owen-farrell/">Owen Farrell</a> which he considered the highlight.</p>
      <p>“There was also a lovely moment at the end of the game when, unbeknown to me, my TMO Marius Jonker had arranged for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england/players/owen-farrell/">Owen Farrell</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/crusaders/players/kieran-read/">Kieran Read</a>, the respective captains, to sign the match ball for me,” he wrote.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“Marius and my touch judges held a little presentation in the changing room when they handed over the ball. I can tell you there was a little tear in my eyes, I got a bit emotional, knowing it was my final World Cup game and this was such a lovely note upon which to finish.</p>
      <p>“Owen and Kieran had each written ‘Best wishes Nige.’ They are a credit to the sport, two top quality players, but who are also brilliant captains and are impressive characters on and off the pitch.</p>
      <p>“From my own experience as a referee, you rarely get a moment’s trouble with either of them. Very dignified individuals, great role models.”</p>

      <p>Owens said he would take the ball back home with him to Wales and put it on display at Pontyberem RFC and Mynyddcerrig Workingmen’s Club.</p>
      <p>He added that he would likely donate it to one of the charities he’s involved with in future.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, opening up on the experience officiating last weekend’s massive semifinal, Owens said it was an “incredible” match to be a part of, referencing England’s radical response to the haka.</p>
      <p>“You just sensed you were in the middle of something special even before kick-off when England formed that V shape for the haka. A spine-tingling moment, I could sense the passion down there on the pitch,” he wrote.</p>

      <p>“It was something I needed to keep an eye on, but fortunately it didn’t turn ugly and I didn’t have to get involved, apart from telling the few English players in front of me to make sure they kept it respectful. In my view they did.”</p>
      <p>Owens will assist referee Jerome Garces during tonight’s final.</p>
      <p>The All Blacks finished with Rugby World Cup bronze last night after claiming a 40-17 win over Wales.</p>
