      <h1>The Chase's Bradley Walsh's bizarre Canada error has every viewer baffled</h1>
      <h2>The former Coronation Street star was welcoming four contestants onto the show, including Jackie</h2>

      <p>Viewers of The Chase were left scratching their heads on Friday night - after Bradley Walsh made a frankly bizarre error.</p>
      <p>The host of the ITV1 daytime favourite was presenting the quiz show on Friday, November 1.</p>
      <p>The episode - the final instalment of the five-day working week - left viewers baffled, though.</p>
      <p>Twitter and Facebook were awash with comments after Bradley made an odd - and out of character - gaffe.</p>
      <p>The former Coronation Street star was welcoming four contestants onto the show, including Jackie.</p>
      <p>The 67-year-old, from the Isle of Wight, was on the show in a bid to land a life-changing sum of money.</p>

      <p>But it wasn't her going head to head with the Chaser that anybody was talking about.</p>
      <p>No, in fact, Bradley left the restaurateur - and viewers - stunned after asking what she would spend the prize money on if she won a huge fund.</p>
      <p>Jackie said she would like to see her sister in Canada.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Bradley replied: "We'll get you to Canadia".</p>
      <p>"I’m sorry Bradley but we can’t accept Canadia. The correct answer is Canada," one viewer joked.</p>
      <p>Another asked Bradley whether he was "OK", and another simply asked: "Really Bradley?"</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Lmao", another wrote.</p>
      <p>And a fellow viewer questioned: "Why did Bradley just call it "Canadia?"</p>
