      <p>Shirley Ballas has a stressful job as the head judge on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> , with fans scrutinising every decision she makes.</p>
      <p>But fortunately, the 59-year-old has a plush house in London where she can come home to relax after a live show.</p>
      <p>She often gives her fans glimpses into her home on her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account, showing off the modern furniture and posh decor.</p>
      <p>Her living room has trendy crushed velvet sofas in different shades of green, with a big flat screen TV sat in the middle on a white self.</p>
      <p>The chic room had dark hardwood floors that compliment the furniture.</p>

      <p>Shirley previously told <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/homes/gallery/2019102779290/inside-strictly-come-dancing-judges-houses/3/">Hello!</a> magazine that she enlisted the help of interior design company The Sparkle Company to decorate her entire house.</p>

      <p>She told the publication: "When I got the Strictly job it made sense to come back to England.</p>
      <p>"It was quite difficult to commute back and forth, and I really wanted to build my charity work. I simply can’t do that if I am on the other side of the world."</p>
      <p>*Strictly Come Dancing returns on Saturday at 7pm on BBC One</p>
