      <p>A sequel to <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i> has been announced on social media with a brief teaser clip.</p>
      <p>The ten-second video depicts variations on a graffiti-style Spider-Man logo with ‘2022’ superimposed on top – the year that fans can expect to see the latest installment in the animated <i>Spider-Verse</i> story. Watch the clip below.</p>

      <p>The original <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i>, which came out in December 2018, proved to be a massive hit, grossing $138 million worldwide in just 12 days. Speaking to the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-animation-20181227-story.html">LA Times</a>, filmmakers <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/spiderman-into-the-spider-verse-artists-how-long-2425263">Phil Lord and Chris Miller revealed that it took 800 people four years to create the film</a> – which may explain why fans are having to wait a few years for its sequel.</p>
      <p>“We wanted it to look like when you open a comic book or a graphic novel for the first time,” Lord said, revealing that each second of the 117-minute film took an artist a week to complete. The pair also claimed they didn’t receive their first perfect shot until a year and a half into the process.</p>

      <p>The newly announced <i>Spider-Verse</i> sequel will potentially be the tenth standalone <i>Spider-Man</i> film this century, following Sam Raimi’s trilogy, two <i>Amazing Spider-Man</i> films, <i>Spider-Man: Homecoming</i>, the first <i>Into the Spider-Verse</i>, <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i> and a <i>Far From Home</i> sequel currently due in 2021.</p>
      <p>In August 2017, following the release of <i>Homecoming</i>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/spider-man-star-tom-holland-responds-to-kirsten-dunsts-homecoming-criticism-2119451">Kirsten Dunst suggested the franchise had become nothing more than a cash cow</a>. Asked about the new movie before it came out, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/kirsten-dunst-slams-spider-man-reboots-who-cares-2082389">Dunst said</a>: “We made the best ones, so who cares? I’m like, ‘You make it all you want.’ They’re just milking that cow for money. It’s so obvious. You know what I mean?”</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/spider-man-homecoming-review">four-star review of <i>Spider-Man: Homecoming</i></a>, the most recent film in the <i>Spider-Man</i> universe, <i>NME</i> said: “<i>Homecoming</i> is the third Spider-Man reboot in 15 years, but Holland’s story outshines both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield’s outings by entrenching itself in existing MCU canon while also keeping things feather-light.”</p>
