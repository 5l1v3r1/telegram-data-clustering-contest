        <b>SHANGHAI, China, Nov 2 – Yaya Toure was sent off after kicking an opponent just 10 seconds into Qingdao Huanghai’s celebratory final match of the China League One season on Saturday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Barcelona and Manchester City midfielder lashed out as Qingdao went on the attack from kick-off at home to Nantong Zhiyun.</p>
      <p>After a review by the video assistant referee (VAR), the referee showed the 36-year-old Toure a red card with less than two minutes on the clock.</p>
      <p>His Qingdao side, who had already been promoted to the top-tier Chinese Super League, lost 2-1 but were still crowned champions.</p>
      <p>It could be an ignominious end at Qingdao for Toure, who told AFP last week that he intends to move on in the new year.</p>
      <p>But he has no intention of retiring and said that he wants to play until he is 40.</p>
