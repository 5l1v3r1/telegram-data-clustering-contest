      <p>MINISTER Michael Ring will today (Friday) re-launch the Cosmetic Creations brand which employs 51 people in Mayo.</p>
      <p>The company has considerably strengthened its overall business by the acquisition of its new Cork facility, at which 40 people are employed, and has successfully integrated it with its Mayo plant.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of the event, Minister Ring said: “We need to celebrate our indigenous businesses which are such an important source of employment in rural communities. Here in Mayo we can offer companies excellent infrastructure, skilled workers and high quality third level institutes within the region.</p>
      <p>“Aiden and Loraine and all the team at Cosmetic Creations have shown great foresight, ambition and courage in building the business in a highly competitive market and have achieved a lot in the past three years. This is evidenced by the amount of jobs the company supports in our own county and in Cork.</p>
      <p>“I’m delighted that the government, through Enterprise Ireland, has been able to support Cosmetic Creations to develop and expand.</p>
      <p>“In building the business with fast growing Irish brands that have a strong export focus, Cosmetic Creations has put itself in a strong position to generate significant business with large customers in a number of export markets.</p>
      <p>“I’ve no doubt this will be a success and will generate significant additional employment at both plants. The vision for the company is to have it as one of Europe’s leading contract cosmetic product manufacturers that will have a strong reputation for customer support and technical expertise.”</p>
