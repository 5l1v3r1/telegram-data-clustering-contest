      <h1>Ali-Nakyea advocates for effective enforcement of anti-corruption laws</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:57:59+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:57</time> by <a rel="author">Iddi Yire, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 21, GNA - Mr Abdallah Ali-Nakyea, Managing Partner of Ali-Nakyea and Associates, has called for effective and strict enforcement of existing anti-corruption laws in the country.</p>
      <p>He said in spite of strategies adopted over the period, Ghana’s performance in combating corruption could be better if there is effective implementation of existing anti-corruption laws.</p>
      <p>Mr Ali-Nakyea said this at the seventh National Development Forum in Accra.</p>
      <p>The forum, which was organised by the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) on the theme: “Confronting the Menace of Corruption in Ghana”, registered more than 200 participants, including anti-corruption campaigners, academics and economists.</p>
      <p>Issues of corruption in Ghana have been discussed on diverse platforms and in the media and views about the nature, extent, causes and effects have been conveyed.</p>
      <p>NDPC over the last six months of the fora, has engaged with stakeholders from diverse segments of society on the future of the country.</p>
      <p>Mr Ali-Nakyea said the Ghana Integrity Initiative (GII) report indicates that Ghana loses about three billion dollars to corruption annually, which consequently retards growth, good governance and reduces the ability of developing countries to supply essential public services.</p>
      <p>He said according to a 2015 survey conducted by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) the causes of corruption included; get rich quick, greed and selfishness and low salaries.</p>
      <p>“Other causes include poor technological infrastructure, weak institutions, undermining of institutions by politicians, lack of political will, poor ethical standards, lack of accountability, and lack of effective corruption reporting system”, he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Ali-Nakyea, who delivered the keynote address, said Ghana has over the years, since independence created policies to curb this menace, sadly these have remained largely unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>He said national anti-corruption policies over the years, have included; appealing to religious bodies to exhort citizens; execution of corrupt persons; confiscation of corruptly acquired properties; and strengthening and setting up of institutions as the Police and Auditor General’s Department.</p>
      <p>Mr Ali-Nakyea said that the strategies to adopt were not exhaustive, however, to curb and make great strides as well block the leakages in the economy, there is the need to invest in technology to reduce the human interface.</p>
      <p>He also highlighted on empowering the various anti-corruption agencies and institutions in such a manner that it does not encourage political interference.</p>
      <p>He said there is a need to sensitise society as to the dire effects of corruption; making corruption unattractive by punishing even party faithful and persons in power; and implementing recommendations of the Auditor–General, Public Accounts Committee and other institutions.</p>
      <p>Mr Ali-Nakyea called for responsible press, saying the media gathering, analysing, organizing, presenting and disseminating information would create the necessary public awareness and that would provide the momentum for undertaking reforms to overcome corruption.</p>
      <p>Professor Henry Kwasi Prempeh, Executive Director, Ghana Centre for Democratic (CDD-Ghana), said corruption widens the gap between the rich and the poor in the society.</p>
      <p>He said not only does it deprive the poor of their resources and opportunities, even worse, such resources are diverted into the hands of others often less needy who use these resources to finance conspicuous consumption and other socially unproductive lifestyles.</p>
      <p>Prof Prempeh said the class inequality that corruption fuels poses a present danger to social peace, and law and order.</p>
      <p>“We should also not forget that, corruption, insofar as it tends to turn on access to power and resources, also fuels and exacerbates gender inequality in our society."</p>
      <p>Professor Stephen Adei, Chairman, NDPC, said as part efforts to combat corruption, the time has come for all public office holders and senior public servants to sign a code of ethics, and declare their assets openly.</p>
