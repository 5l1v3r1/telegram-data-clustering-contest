      <h1>Mary Lou McDonald refusing to be 'dragged into politics of condemnation'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:24:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>The Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald has said she does not want to get dragged into a row over the politics of condemnation.</p>
      <p>Ms McDonald had been criticised after she declined to condemn the attempted murder of Arlene Foster's father in 1979.</p>
      <p>She has today described an IRA attack on John Kelly who was a serving policeman in the North as "wrong".</p>
      <p>Deputy McDonald added that it is also wrong that Ms Foster had to witness that level of violence against a family member.</p>
      <p>However, she said it is dishonourable of politicians to get dragged into a game of speaking out against every single act of violence perpetrated during the Troubles.</p>
      <p>Ms McDonald said: "The politics of condemnation is a rabbit hole that I will not go down because it becomes a tit-for-tat, you said I said, and it becomes a tennis match between very, very hurt and very, very damaged people and communities."</p>
