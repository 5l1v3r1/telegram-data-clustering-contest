      <h4>Ramdev Baba defends Periyar statement:</h4>
      <p>Previously in a tweet, Yoga guru Ramdev Baba had stated that anyone who respected one's ancestors  Lord Ram and Lord Krishna they will defend them. Citing leaders like Ambedkar, Jyotiba Phule, Savitribai Phule, and others, he said that he respected them a lot. But as renowned socialist and 'Father of the Dravidian movement' Periyar's ideologies were against mythology, he stated that he felt the need to defend them.</p>
