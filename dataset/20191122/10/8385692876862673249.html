      <p>Black Friday has <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">come early</a> for the Sony HT-X9000F sound bar and wireless subwoofer. Today you can pick it up for just $398. That's good for over $200 off of its regular price. Making it an inexpensive way to add Dolby Atmos to your setup today.</p>
      <p>This sound bar and wireless subwoofer set is a really good one to pick up for your entertainment center. If you have a guy on your shopping list this holiday season, this is definitely a really good one to pick up.</p>
      <p>The HT-X9000F is a great option as it allows for some really good sounding audio. Sony, as you might know, is a music label, so its speakers and sound bars always sound really good. As it wants its music to sound good on its own speakers and sound bars â€“ makes lots of sense right? So the bass is usually very deep and boomy while the mids and highs are still crisp and clear.</p>

      <p>Mix in Dolby Atmos, and you're getting a really good experience out of this unit. Dolby Atmos is going to take that audio and make it pop even more. If you've never heard anything in Dolby Atmos, give it a try. Afterwards, you'll never ever want to go back to anything without Dolby Atmos.</p>
      <p>If you prefer to use DTS:X, that is also available on this unit. As well as Dolby Atmos. So you've got the best of both worlds.</p>
      <p>The wireless subwoofer in this set can go on the other side of the room, and this can be set up with other speakers. It is only a 2.1-channel sound bar though. So you can't go crazy with a 7.1 setup, unfortunately.</p>
