      <p>President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday urged the political class to thoroughly read the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) report before reacting to it.</p>
      <p>President Kenyatta publicly confirmed being <a href="https://www.pulselive.co.ke/news/president-uhuru-kenyatta-to-receive-bbi-report-on-november-26-bbi-chair-yusuf-haji/svmrfd8">notified by BBI Chairman</a> Senator Yusuf Haji that the report was ready and he would receive it on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>He proceeded to caution politicians against using the BBI report to further divide the country.</p>
      <p>"I have this morning been notified that the BBI report is ready and I have told the team to bring it to me on Tuesday. My only prayer, especially to the political class, because I know wananchi have no problem - read the report before commenting on it."</p>
      <p>"I have seen some attacking it even before they read it and I am appealing to them to use this opportunity to create good ideas that will bring peace and cohesion in our country," President Kenyatta said.</p>
      <p>He made the remarks while presiding over a graduation ceremony at Kibabii University.</p>
