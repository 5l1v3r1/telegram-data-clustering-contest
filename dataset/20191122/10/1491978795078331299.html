        <i>The novelist on learning from John Updike, failing to read Anthony Trollope and the laugh-out-loud comedy of Nina Stibbe</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>The book I am currently reading</b><br/><i>Nothing to See Here</i> by Kevin Wilson. It’s about a brother and sister who catch fire whenever they’re anxious or upset. They don’t burn themselves up but they torch everything around them. It’s a brilliant commentary on what makes kids unlikable and how adults choose to deal with them.</p>
      <p><b>The book that changed my life</b><br/><i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/28/kate-camillo-newbery-medal-ulysses-aventures">The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane</a></i> by Kate DiCamillo. I only read it a year ago, but it made me completely rethink what literature for children is capable of and what it means to have a full, complex and deeply satisfying novel that can be read in two hours. I’ve since read all of DiCamillo’s work and believe she has no equal.</p>
      <p><b>The book I wish I’d written</b><br/><i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/20/featuresreviews.guardianreview13">Old Filth</a></i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/20/featuresreviews.guardianreview13"> by Jane Gardam</a>. It’s an extraordinary novel – the structure, the characters, the sweep of time.</p>
      <p><b>The book that had the greatest influence on me</b><br/>As wildly unfashionable as they are, I learned more from reading the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/17/julian-barnes-john-updike-rabbit">Rabbit Angstrom novels of John Updike</a> than anything else. They embody four decades of the United States in writing so glittering and precise that it manages to overcome the consistently offensive views of the main character.</p>
      <p><b>The book I think is most underrated</b><br/><i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/28/casual-vacancy-jk-rowling-review">The Casual Vacancy</a></i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/28/casual-vacancy-jk-rowling-review"> by JK Rowling</a>. I felt everyone sharpened their knives on that book. I thought it was brilliant.</p>
      <aside>I felt like everyone sharpened their knives on JK Rowling’s The Casual Vacancy</aside>
      <p><b>The book that changed my mind</b><br/><i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/30/hunger-by-roxane-gay-review-one-bodys-lessons-for-everybody">Hunger</a></i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/30/hunger-by-roxane-gay-review-one-bodys-lessons-for-everybody"> by Roxane Gay</a>. It opened my eyes to how we are judgmental without realising it, and the burden that places on the recipient. It’s a great book, and a great reminder about all we don’t know about other people’s lives.</p>
      <p><b>The last book that made me cry</b><br/><i>Brother, I’m Dying</i> by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/20/featuresreviews.guardianreview9">Edwidge Danticat</a>. This story about her childhood in Haiti and her love for both her father and her uncle remains my favourite memoir.</p>
      <p><b>The last book that made me laugh</b><br/>My father used to say if he were a rich man he would have sent me to laughing school. I recently met Nina Stibbe and went back to listen to the audiobook of <i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/10/love-nina-stibbe-review">Love, Nina</a></i> again, and again, I honked like a goose through the whole thing.</p>
      <p><b>The book I couldn’t finish</b><br/><i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview28">The Man Without Qualities</a></i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview28"> by Robert Musil</a>. I’ve tried several times and frankly I have to lie down every two pages and try to take in what I’ve read. I don’t think I’ve ever made it past page 80. I really do mean to try again.</p>
      <p><b>The book I’m most ashamed not to have read</b><br/>Not a book, an author: Trollope. I’ve only read one Trollope. It is an overwhelming deficit.</p>
      <p><b>The book I give as a gift</b><br/>As a bookshop owner, I’m a great believer in bringing books to dinner parties. I give books for pretty much all occasions. I’m especially fond of Lucy Dawson’s <i>Dogs As I See Them</i>. She was a famous dog portraitist in England in the 1930s and 40s. If you look her up you’ll recognize her work. Her sketches are somehow profound in their simplicity, as are her brief descriptions of how many biscuits a particular dog required in order to hold still.</p>
      <p><b>My earliest reading memory</b><br/><i>The Lonely Doll</i> by Dare Wright. It was the favourite book of my older sister. Wright took black and white photographs of a doll who lives alone until a couple of bears come along and offer her a shot at family life. It is both creepy and haunting.</p>
      <p><b>My comfort read</b><br/><i>Our Town</i> by Thornton Wilder. It is my necessary text.</p>
