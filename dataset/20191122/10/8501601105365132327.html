      <p>The club emerged from the relegation zone to become the runner-up of V-League 2019 under coach Chung Hae-song. They also reached the semis of National Cup 2019 and were chosen to represent Vietnam at AFC Cup 2020 after Hanoi FC was disqualified for failing to meet AFC requirements.</p>

      <p>It is reported that Ho Chi Minh FC are eyeing Vietnamese-Czech goalkeeper Filip Nguyen. Earlier, they pledged to bring overseas players back to Vietnam to help the national team.</p>
      <p>Filip Nguyen, who plays for Slovan Liberec, is one of the best goalkeepers of the Czech Republic’s top-tier league. He once expressed a desire to come back to Vietnam and play for the national team. But his transfer cost, estimated at one million USD, poses a significant financial barrier for Ho Chi Minh FC.</p>

      <p>English midfielder Jordon Mutch and forward Jay Emmanuel-Thomas, and Korean striker Kim Yu-Song are also on the radar for Ho Chi Minh FC. Thomas was a former player for Arsenal FC in the English Premier League. Kim Yu-Song scored the equalizer for April 25 in the 2-2 draw with Hanoi FC at the AFC Cup 2019. Jordan Mutch played for Crystal Palace but was unable to maintain his top form because of injuries.</p>
