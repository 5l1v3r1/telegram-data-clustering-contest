      <h1>FIR reportedly lodged against Yash Raj Films over non payment of royalties</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:20:40+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>Salim Merchant, from the Indian score composers duo Salim-Sulaiman, shocked Bollywood buffs on Thursday by alleging that the prestigious production house Yash Raj Films (YRF) has not paid him royalties despite having collected the same. He added that this was the reason he has not worked with YRF over the past four years.</p>
      <p>“Yash Raj has been collecting money on behalf of the composer and lyricist, that much I know. However, I don’t know whether they have paid anyone. They have certainly not paid me and Sulaiman,” Salim told <i>The Quint</i>.</p>

      <p>The Indian Performing Rights Society (IPRS), which comprises composers, singers and lyricists, reportedly filed an FIR against Yash Raj Films on November 20. It has been alleged that YRF has collected over Rs 100 crore in music royalty, which actually belongs to members of IPRS.</p>
      <p>Revealing another big name, Salim also claimed that the music label T-Series has not paid his complete dues yet.</p>
      <p>Sources have also told the outlet that YRF has allegedly prevented artists of the IPRS from collecting royalties by pressurising them.</p>
      <p>Salim further claimed IPRS chairperson and veteran lyricist Javed Akhtar has also been deprived of his dues.”I know Javed Akhtar sahab has not been paid, for sure.  Sulaiman and I have not been paid – any royalties that have come from Yash Raj,” he reiterated.</p>
      <p>Most of Salim-Sulaiman’s biggest hit songs are with YRF productions. These include music in films such as <i>Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi</i>, <i>Mardaani</i>, <i>Ladies vs Ricky Bahl</i>, <i>Aaja Nachle</i>, <i>Band Baaja Baarat</i> and<i> Chak De</i> <i>India</i>, among others.</p>
      <p>The duo is now focusing on performing at concerts globally and composing singles, besides creating music for films.</p>
