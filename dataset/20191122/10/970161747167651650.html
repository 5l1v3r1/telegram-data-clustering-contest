      <p>The Streets will bring their high-energy live show to Norwich in 2020 to kick off a brand new series of outdoor summer gigs in the city.</p>
      <p>The Norfolk city will play host next summer to Friday Night Live, which is being organised by the team behind the successful Sunday Sessions and Let’s Rock festival series.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mike-skinner/">Mike Skinner</a> and The Streets, who returned to the stage in 2017 with a collection of new songs and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/18/the-streets-mike-skinner-confirms-theyre-coming-back-with-a-new-album-8153614/">talk of a new album</a>, will take to the stage at Earlham Park on 22 May, which is the opening night of the Friday Night Live series.</p>

      <p>Support acts for the opening night of Friday Night Live will be confirmed in due course.</p>
      <p>“Friday Night Live will bring the biggest and best artists to outdoor locations all over the UK for an evening of unforgettable live music, and we’re absolutely thrilled to launch the event with an artist as iconic as The Streets,” the organisers of the new event said.</p>

      <p>Tickets for The Streets’ gig at Friday Night Live went on sale this morning (22 November) – you can find those and more information about the gig <a href="https://fridaynightlive.net/">here.</a></p>
      <p>Sounds like it’s going to be quite the night down in Norwich next May – let’s all just hope Skinner doesn’t go too wild mid-performance <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/20/streets-mike-skinner-shares-gruesome-video-shoulder-popped-dislocation-stage-dive-8366018/">and dislocate his shoulder during one of his customary crowdsurfs like he did earlier this year.</a></p>
