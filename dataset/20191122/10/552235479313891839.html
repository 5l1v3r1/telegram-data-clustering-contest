      <h1>Steven Gerrard makes Rangers contract pledge as he hails 'box office' Alfredo Morelos</h1>
      <h2>The Ibrox boss is preparing for a season defining period as the international break comes to an end.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:33:43+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:33</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>Steven Gerrard has told his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> stars that new contracts will take care of themselves - if they bring silverware to Ibrox.</p>
      <p>Rangers are set to embark on a season-defining period that includes a Betfred Cup semi-final showdown with Celtic.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Gerrard</a> 's side sit just one goal behind their Glasgow rivals in the Premiership and are also on course to reach the Europa League last 32.</p>
      <p>Nikola Katic and Ryan Jack have been rewarded with improved terms this season with extensions for the likes of Jermain Defoe and Allan McGregor also a possibility.</p>
      <p>But the Rangers boss insists there will be no reward without trophies as he previews Sunday's visit to Hamilton.</p>

      <p>He said: "The players don't have to worry about new contracts, if they perform to a top-level consistently and bring silverware they will be rewarded by the club.</p>
      <p>"The form we are in there is one part wanting to play play play but is important when you get a chance for a rest for the players and staff to use it in the right way.</p>
      <p>"There are some really interesting fixtures in this next block up to Christmas, it is exciting and the players have earned the chance to have this but the focus is all on Hamilton for now."</p>
      <p>A number of Gerrard's stars returned from international duty over the past few days in buoyant mood.</p>
      <p>Glen Kamara and Filip Helander celebrated Euro 2020 qualification with Finland and Sweden, while there was also a first Colombia goal for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> to savour.</p>

      <p>The striker has now hit 23 overall this season and Gerrard reserved special praise for his talisman, hailing him as "box office".</p>
      <p>Gerrard said: "We are very pleased for Alfredo, it was only a matter of time before he got his goal. Scoring goals is what he does.</p>
      <p>"People forget he is still 22, he is box-office.</p>
      <p>"I have no doubt he will continue to answer all questions that come his way."</p>
      <p>And, after he was pictured back in training on Thursday, Gerrard confirmed Jordan Jones is closing in on a comeback at just the right time.</p>
      <p>He added: " <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jordan-jones">Jordan Jones</a> is back in full training, I am delighted to have him back. I predict he will be available for selection in 10 days by the time he gets up to speed."</p>
