      <p><b>ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: </b>Two Pakistan International Airline (PIA) flights landed safely after technical issues developed during flights to their destinations.</p>
      <p>The engine of flight PK-650, enroute from Lahore to Islamabad, malfunctioned and shut down after reportedly ingesting a foreign object.</p>
      <p>The pilot switched the engine off and landed the plane safely.</p>
      <p>There were 38 passengers onboard besides the PIA staff, all of whom remained unhurt in the incident.</p>

      <p>Another PIA flight, PK-257, developed a fault in its landing gear soon after takeoff. The aircraft was travelling from Peshawar to Sharjah.</p>
      <p>Reportedly soon after takeoff from Bacha Khan International Airport, certain aircraft systems crashed. The system crash also affected the autopilot, auto thrust and other sub-systems.</p>
      <p>After repeated attempts to close the landing gear, the pilot swerved around and landed back at Peshawar airport. More than 100 passengers were onboard.</p>
      <p>After landing, PIA engineers conducted a detailed inspection of the aircraft at Peshawar airport but failed to resolve the technical problem.</p>
      <p>In July, A PIA flight survived a scare as the plane skidded off the runway while landing at the Gilgit airport.</p>
      <p>“The ATR-42 aircraft skidded a little off an unpaved patch. The pilots exhibited great skill and composure to regain control and ensure everyone’s safety,” said a spokesperson for the national flag carrier.</p>
      <p>Over the past years, there have been recurring safety issues with PIA flights in the country’s northern areas.</p>
