      <h1>Ever wanted to write like Donald Trump? Now you can.</h1>

      <p>Donald Trump is in the midst of an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50506917">impeachment inquiry</a> for allegedly using his position in the White House to pressure the president of Ukraine into investigating political rivals for the 2020 presidential election. But let’s put that aside for a bit, because the POTUS has given us another dazzling display of comedic value during a press conference held outside the White House on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Photographers managed to get a shot of Trump referring to his handwritten notes—and of course, they are written in his huge, immediately recognisable writing. Not forgetting, of course, that the <i>President</i> misspelt his Ukrainian counterpart’s name.</p>

      <p>This isn’t the first time that Trump’s comically huge handwriting has made the front pages. A genuinely laughable example was his handwritten note where he mentions the Islamist militant organisation: “Alcaida”. Perhaps these are phonetic cues, rather than actual words (it’s Al-Qaeda), but he’s made these spelling errors before.</p>

      <p>And some folks have actually gone through the trouble of creating an actual font that mimics Trump’s handwriting—and it looks pretty darn accurate. 3 years ago, <i><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/benking/tiny-hand-will-be-your-new-comic-sans#.vtq5xXqzB">Buzzfeed News</a></i> created “Tiny Hand”: a font that, typically, types in capital letters exclusively.</p>
      <p>It’s free to download, and you’ll have to head over to the original post to download it (<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/benking/tiny-hand-will-be-your-new-comic-sans#.vtq5xXqzB">click here</a>). After it’s been downloaded, unzip the file, and install the .otf file. We’ve tested out the font with Microsoft Word:</p>
