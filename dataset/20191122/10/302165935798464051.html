      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 22 — Bursa Malaysia rebounded from yesterday’s losses to end higher today, on buying support in selected heavyweights amid mixed market sentiment.</p>
      <p>At 5pm, the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) rose 4.65 points to finish at 1,596.84 from 1,592.19 at the close yesterday, after moving between 1,589.25 and 1,600.06 throughout the day.</p>
      <p>The barometer index, which opened 2.32 points weaker at 1,589.87, moved in negative territory during the morning session but managed to recover during mid-day on the back of mixed headlines on US-China trade.</p>
      <p>On the broader market, there were 398 gainers and 423 losers, while 412 counters were unchanged, 794 untraded and 15 others suspended.</p>

      <p>A dealer said sentiment in the market was influenced by a recent report that said US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were invited to Beijing under the invitation of Chinese Vice Premier Liu He for further talks on the trade.</p>
      <p>This has caused confusion among investors, wherein sentiment has been compounded by news that US President Donald Trump is supportive of the Hong Kong bill.</p>
      <p>Among heavyweights on Bursa, Public Bank rose four sen to RM19.86, Tenaga and Petronas Chemicals chalked up 10 sen each to RM13.58 and RM7.11 respectively, while Maybank was flat at RM8.64.</p>

      <p>Warrants turnover decreased to 274.38 million units worth RM626.79 million versus yesterday’s 394.17 million units valued at RM74.0 million.</p>
