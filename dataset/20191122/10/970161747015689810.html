      <p>We’re so used to seeing Jason Derulo shirtless, it’s actually more of a shock to see him fully dressed, but his latest Instagram photo had everyone doing a double take.</p>
      <p>The singer, 30, shared a photo of his recent trip to Bali with fans… but the only thing people noticed about the shot was the blatant ‘d**k print’ in the NSFW snap.</p>
      <p>Jason shared the photo of him wearing the world’s tiniest and tightest pair of black swimming trunks (or possibly boxers, we’ve been too scared to zoom in too close) as he stood on the edge of an infinity pool.</p>
      <p>Of course, fans were quick to comment on the racy photo, asking what he had in his pants… to which Jason replied that it was an ‘anaconda’.</p>
      <p>He also commented: ‘Don’t lie… did you zoom?’</p>

      <p>No, Jason. Nobody had to zoom. It’s all up in our eyeballs enough without zooming in, thanks.</p>
      <p>Fans were quick to express their shock at the ‘when you see it’ in the photo, posting: ‘sweet Mary mother of god’ and ‘DAAAAAAMN’.</p>

      <p>Pictures of his junk aside, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/jason-derulo-responds-backlash-creepy-weird-cats-movie-11172695/">Jason also hit the headlines for his new movie, Cats,</a> as he responded to the criticism surrounding the trailer.</p>
      <p>He told Confidential: ‘I don’t think I have ever seen such a polarising reaction from any other trailer ever.</p>

      <p>‘I knew that was what it would be from the jump and that is what I hoped it would be because that is what I felt like was the magic of the stage play.</p>
      <p>‘It is unlike anything that you’ve ever seen before so everything that has been said about it being creepy or left and weird, it is all of that and more.’</p>
      <p>Well, at least he’s found a suitable way to distract everyone from that…</p>
