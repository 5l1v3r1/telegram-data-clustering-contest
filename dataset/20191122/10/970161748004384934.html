      <p>YouTuber Bretman Rock has been forced to plead with fans to ‘let him be sad’ after his father’s death, with his viewers turning up at the funeral.</p>
      <p>The vlogger’s father sadly died after going into a coma, with Bretman flying to the Philippines for the funeral.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old tweeted: ‘Can people just let me be sad for onces…. I’m here in the Philippines for my dad who just passed, don’t come to my house and ask me for pictures [sic].</p>
      <p>‘So many people showed up to my <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dads/">dads</a> funeral uninvited and started taking pics of my dad and my family.. Like why?It’s common sense.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘I just don’t understand why people think it’s okay to ask me for pictures when my eyes are literally swollen from crying … how you you gonna say “condolences , can we take a picture ?”’</p>

      <p>‘This is disrespectful beyond belief,’ another told him, with one more adding: ‘I’m so sorry love. I’m keeping you and your family in my prayers.’</p>

      <p>Fearing hoards may turn up to their 50-year-old father’s funeral, the YouTube stars politely begged punters to give them space.</p>
      <p>‘If you are a fan of Grayson and I we love you and appreciate you so much. The best way you could support us during this tough time is to NOT show up at our father’s wake or funeral,’ Ethan tweeted.</p>
      <p>‘Thank you guys and please please please respect my wish.’ Grayson also posted, as he tweeted: ‘We want this ceremony to be an opportunity for the people who had a close connection with my Dad to say goodbye and pay their respects.</p>
