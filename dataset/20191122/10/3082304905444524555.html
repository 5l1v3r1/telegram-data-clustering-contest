        <b>Barcelona are keen to solve their defensive woes ahead of the upcoming 2020-21 season, and as per reports, they have decided that they will try to sign Bayern Munich’s Joshua Kimmich to bolster their back-four.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191122/471782380235/el-plan-de-fichajes-del-barca-para-2020.html"><i>Mundo Deportivo</i></a> claims that Joshua Kimmich is one of Barcelona’s top targets, and also that they hope to make a move for him next summer.</p>
      <p>Kimmich joined Bayern Munich from VfB Stuttgart in 2015, for a reported transfer fee of €8.5million. Since then, he has made 189 appearances for the reigning Bundesliga champions – and has also scored 18 goals and provided 45 assists, thereby proving that he is equally effective in attacking and creating goal-scoring opportunities as well.</p>
      <p>In the ongoing 2019-20 season, the 24-year-old right-back has scored one goal and recorded five assists in just 11 appearances across various competitions – his only goal came in the Champions League, during Bayern’s 7-2 rout of last season’s finalists Tottenham Hotspur on 19th October.</p>
      <p>Kimmich’s arrival at Barcelona would mean that their current right-back Nelson Semedo would be replaced – but that will not be a big issue as the Catalans are already listening to offers for the Portuguese star ahead of the upcoming January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Last week, it was reported that Inter Milan are interested, but they are yet to submit a formal offer, as per various sources.</p>
