      <p>How <i>Age of Empires 4</i> is going to work in the current climate is all sorts of fascinating. But just as important, and demanded by fans, is a bit of love for <i>Age of Empires 3</i>. Which it's getting.</p>
      <p>Microsoft this morning published a behind the scenes video into <i>Age of Empires 4</i>, which had a few new shots of in-game scenery and things in motion, although nothing that you'd really call "gameplay" at this stage. But at the top of the video, a voiceover and graphic confirmed that <i>Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition</i> is in the works, which is nice for fans:</p>

      <p>So that's nice. It's not <i>Age of Mythology</i>, which fans have been screaming for even more, although the current "HD" version <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/266840/Age_of_Mythology_Extended_Edition/">isn't too bad.</a> If you want to see more of how that's coming along, and by more I mean a couple of seconds more, then you get a glimpse of that below.</p>

      <p>Of course, there's still the unanswered question of how developers can make RTS truly popular again in this day and age. I'm deathly curious to see how <i>AOE 4</i> answers that question, if at all.</p>
