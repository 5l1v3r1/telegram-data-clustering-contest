      <h1>Twitter’s ‘hide replies’ feature now available in South Africa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:36:52+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:36</time> by <a rel="author">Shereesa Moodley</a></address>
      <p>Twitter on Thursday announced that its “hide replies” feature is now available globally.</p>
      <p>This means that you can now hide any unsavoury comments on your tweets and have more control over conversations you engage with on the platform.</p>
      <p>“Out of sight, out of mind,” Twitter tweeted.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you can also unhide replies on your tweets too.</p>
      <p>For the sake of transparency, however, your followers will still be able to view hidden replies on your tweets under a separate tab.</p>
      <p>The company first tested the feature in Canada earlier this year, before expanding the test to <a href="https://memeburn.com/?p=170323&amp;preview=true">Japan and the US in September</a>.</p>
