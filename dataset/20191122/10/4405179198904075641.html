      <h2>Looking to save money on a new or refurbished Apple tablet? Here are the best cheap iPad deals, discounts and offers available in November 2019, as the Black Friday offers start to appear</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:57:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/author/dominic-preston/" target="_blank">Dominic Preston</a></address>
      <p>Apple makes the best tablets around, but they come with premium price tags. The company itself rarely offers a discount, but don't despair - if you know where to look, it's possible to find a good deal on the latest iPads (and even better savings on the older models).</p>
      <p>Our tech experts constantly scan the market for the very latest and best iPad deals so that you don't need to; in this article we've brought together the best prices for each of the four current iPad models. For each one you'll find an automatically updated price comparison tool, so you can be sure you're getting the best deal.</p>
      <p>It's unusual to see significant money off iPads - even Apple itself will only occasionally offer iTunes vouchers rather than money off the list price. But the Black Friday deals are starting to kick in, and right now you can find savings at <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/browse.html?node=429892031&amp;ascsubtag=41-3665566-11-0000000">Amazon</a> in both the UK and US, and at territory-specific stores such as <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=41-3665566-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fbrowse%2Felectricals%2Fipad-tablets%2Fview-all-tablets%2Fipad-2019%2F_%2FN-5nlvZ1yzk4fg">John Lewis</a> and <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=41-3665566-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fapple-ipads%2Ftablets-and-ereaders%2Ftablets%2F149_3402_32003_267_ba00010673-bv00308594%2Fxx-criteria.html">Currys/PC World</a>.</p>

      <p>In September 2019 Apple introduced a new version of the iPad - read about it in our <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/review/ipad/ipad-102in-2019-3775388/">iPad 10.2in review</a>. This is the 7th-generation iPad and it takes the place of 2018's 9.7in iPad in Apple's lineup. It's still the cheapest iPad, despite having a small price hike in the UK.</p>
      <p>If you're in education you can get a <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/apple/apple-student-discount-education-store-3466634/">discount from Apple's Education Store</a>.</p>
      <p><b>UK RRP:</b> From £329<br/><b>US MSRP:</b> From $329</p>
      <p>You can buy <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-10-2">direct from Apple</a>, but in the table below you'll see the best deals available right now in your region.</p>

      <h3>Best iPad 9.7in (2018) deals</h3>
      <p>It's been officially discontinued, but you may still be able to buy Apple's old entry-level iPad, the iPad 9.7in (2018). Apple has it in the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/ipad/ipad-pro-9-7">Refurbished store</a>, for example.</p>
      <p>We think that this older model, at the right price, could be a better option than the new 2019 model, since the specs are practically identical, bar the screen size. For more, read our <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/review/ipad/ipad-97in-2018-review-3674496/">iPad 9.7in (2018) review</a>.</p>
      <p><b>UK RRP:</b> Was £319 (discontinued)<br/><b>US MSRP:</b> Was $329 (discontinued)</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The iPad mini, at 7.9in, proves that a form factor is still desirable and useful even in an age of larger smartphones. With the A12 processor at an affordable base price, Apple's smallest tablet is a tiny powerhouse of a computer.</p>
      <p>With the addition of Apple Pencil support and with decent battery life, Apple has breathed new life into the iPad mini with the 2019 model. Not everyone wants or needs to spend £1,000 on an iPad Pro. Read our <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/review/ipad/ipad-mini-2019-3694812/">iPad mini (2019) review</a>.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The iPad Air is a powerful and easy-to-use tablet with a large and well-specced screen, long battery life and attractive design, all at a sensible price. There are some compromises here, but as an all-round package this is vastly appealing. Read our <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/review/ipad/ipad-air-2019-3694865/">iPad Air (2019) review</a>.</p>
      <p><b>UK RRP:</b> From £479<br/><b>US MSRP:</b> From $499</p>

      <h3>Best iPad Pro deals</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The iPad Pro is an amazing tablet, complete with a slim-bezel design and top-spec components.</p>
      <p>Really there's little to dislike but do bear in mind that you'll need the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard to make the most of the iPad Pro. Read the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112722&amp;xcust=41-3665566-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fipad%2Fbest-ipad-deals-3665566%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitalartsonline.co.uk%2Freviews%2Fcreative-hardware%2Fipad-pro-2018-review%2F">Apple iPad Pro review</a> on our sister site <i>Digital Arts</i>.</p>
      <p>Both iPad Pro models are available <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro">direct from Apple</a>, but there are some great deals out there from other vendors.</p>
      <p>Note that there are some tempting deals out there for older versions of the iPad Pro - particularly the 10.5in model from 2017, which is available for <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-iPad-Pro-10-5-inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B072K6NR4B?ascsubtag=41-3665566-11-0000000">£398.99 from Amazon</a> (that's going quick) and <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=41-3665566-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fapple-ipad-pro%2Ftablets-and-ereaders%2Ftablets%2F149_3402_32003_267_ba00010673-bv00309450-ba00011326-bv00309266%2Fxx-criteria.html">£399 from Currys</a>. That's the older design, and still has a Home button.</p>

      <h3>Apple Refurbished Store</h3>
      <p>One of our favourite tricks for iPad deals is the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/ipad">Apple Refurbished Store</a>, where you'll find iPads with huge discounts. These are items that have been returned, but you will really struggle to spot any evidence of that.</p>
      <p>Apple replaces the battery and outer shell of every refurbished iPad, and you'll still get all of the accessories and manuals that would come with a new model. Plus, you'll also get the same one-year warranty as you would with a brand-new iPad.</p>
      <p>The only thing that gives the game away is the box - Apple replaces the original with a white box to prevent people from buying the discounted models and selling them as new.</p>
      <h4>Best iPad Student Deals</h4>
      <p>Another great resource to help you save is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112722&amp;xcust=41-3665566-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fipad%2Fbest-ipad-deals-3665566%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmacworld.studentbeans.com%2Fuk">Macworld's Student Deals page</a>, particularly the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112722&amp;xcust=41-3665566-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fipad%2Fbest-ipad-deals-3665566%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmacworld.studentbeans.com%2Fstudent-discount%2Fuk%2Fcats%2Ftech-mobile">Tech &amp; Mobile section</a>.
