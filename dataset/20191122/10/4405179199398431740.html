      <h1>Best MacBook Pro Black Friday Deals</h1>
      <h2>We've scoured the internet for the best MacBook Pro deals from Apple and other retailers in the UK. If you want to buy a cut-price MacBook Pro check here to find out if you could save money on a new Mac laptop this November. Including Black Friday deals!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:02:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/author/karen-haslam/" target="_blank">Karen Haslam</a></address>
      <p>If you're in the market for a MacBook Pro now is a good time to buy as resellers clear out older stock at a discount following the release of the new 16in MacBook Pro on 13 November 2019.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, if the 13in MacBook Pro is more your cup of tea, you should be able to pick up some great deals either on the new entry-level models released in July 2019, or the ones that launched in May 2019.</p>
      <p>You might be able to pick up a great deal on one of the even older Mac laptops - some of which are very similar in spec to the current models. For example, there isn't a huge difference between a 2018 13in 2.3GHz quad-core model and a 2019 13in 2.4GHz quad-core model, both have an 8th-generation processor.</p>
      <p>That's not to say you will only find discounts on the older models. Resellers usually start offering discounts on new Mac laptop models a month or so after Apple introduces them. So it may not be long before we see 16in MacBook Pro discounts.</p>
      <p>Our team of Apple experts have been scouring the web for the top deals, offers and discounts for the MacBook Pro - picking out the best money-off offers to save you time. There are lots of money off deals below, but first we will run through some tips and explain Apple's pricing structure, so that you can be sure you are getting the best discount you can.</p>
      <p>This article focuses on the MacBook Pro, but we have deals for the MacBook Air, and Apple's now-discontinued MacBooks, too. You can also check out our <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac/macbook-air-deals-3685961/">MacBook Air deals article</a> too for more great deals. </p>

      <h3>How to find a good MacBook Pro deal</h3>
      <p>Don't be tricked into buying something you don't need because it seems like a good price, and be aware that some retailers have been known to be misleading about RRP to make a deal look better than it is. Always compare to the  price on the <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/">Apple Store</a> or, if it's an older model take a look at the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished">Apple refurbished store</a> (where they sell reconditioned, discontinued stock with a full year's warranty) to make sure you're getting good value.</p>
      <p>Speaking of which, you also want to be careful of the age of any given MacBook as models from different years might have similar looking specs on paper (especially the 2018 and 2019 MacBook Air whose specs are identical!) For example, the processor speed can be misleading if you aren't sure what generation of processor is being used, so take care to double-check processor speeds and generation, and even model numbers to make sure you're not paying over the odds for a laptop from a few years ago.</p>
      <p>Luckily we've checked out the deals here, and we'll tell you exactly what's on offer - so if it's an older model we'll tell you.</p>

      <h3>How much does the MacBook Pro cost?</h3>
      <p>There are two sizes of MacBook Pro, 13in and 16in. Until recently there was a 15in MacBook Pro but Apple has now discontinued that, however you are likely to still find the 15in model available and there are some good bargains to be had, given that the spec isn't significantly different.</p>
      <p>Prices start at <b>£1,299/US$1,299</b> for the 13in model with a 1.4GHz quad-core 8th-gen i5 processor, 8GB RAM and 128GB SSD.</p>
      <p>There are also two 13in models with more powerful 2.4GHz quad-core processors, prices starting at <b>£1,799/US$1,799</b>.</p>
      <p>The 16in MacBook Pro starts at <b>£2,399/US$2,399</b> for a 2.6GHz 6-core 9th-gen i7 processor, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD.</p>
      <p>Previously the 15in MacBook Pro also started at <b>£2,399/US$2,399</b> for a 2.6GHz 6-core 9th-gen i7 processor, 16GB RAM and 256GB SSD.</p>
      <p>Note, back in July Apple increased the price of the MacBook Pro in the UK. In most cases the increase was £50, but at the top of the range the MacBook Pro is £100 more expensive than it was.</p>
      <p>You'll find more information about the price and specs for each model below. You can order 13in and 16in MacBook Pros <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro">directly from Apple</a>.</p>

      <h4>16in MacBook Pro deals</h4>
      <p>Apple's only just released the 16in MacBook Pro so right now not many resellers are offering money off (if you scroll down to the Best MacBook Deals section you'll find a couple of early deals). If you want the absolute latest Mac, and that gorgeous 16in display, this is where to buy one.

      <h4>15in MacBook Pro deals</h4>
      <p>When Apple updated  the 15in MacBook Pro models in 2019 they moved from 8th generation processors to 9th generation processors, which also meant we gained an 8-core option at the top-of-the-range. Here are the specs for the two models:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2.6GHz 6-core, 256GB: (WAS £2,349/$2,399) NOW <b>£2,399/$2,399</b></li>

      <p>This is <b>2019's 2.4GHz 13in MacBook Pro</b>, it might only be a small boost to the processor speed, compared to the 2018 model, but this is still money off the newest version (and the deal is better than ever now that Apple's put up prices in the UK). This is the best price we have seen for this deal thanks to Amazon's Black Friday promotion.</p>

Note that this model dates back to 2017 though, and we'd recommend the similarly priced 2018/2019 MacBook Air over it, or even paying £1,249 for the new entry-level MacBook Pro. However, while it's available for under £1,000 this is worth considering.</p>

      <h3>Where to get MacBook deals, UK &amp; US</h3>
      <p>Apple discounted the price of the MacBook Air back in July 2019, but this is quite a rare occurrence: Apple never really offers discounts on its Mac laptops - other than through its official <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished">refurbished store</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking of which, you should pay a visit to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/mac">Apple Refurbished Store</a> where you can find cut-price MacBook Pro models. These refurbished models are MacBook Pro laptops that were returned to Apple, perhaps due to a fault, but they are fully reconditioned now and come with a year's warranty.</p>
      <p>For example, in October 2019 we found a refurbished 2017 13in MacBook Pro, which would have cost £1,799 new, for £1,529, a saving of £270. Find the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/mac/2018-2019-macbook-pro">latest refurbished deals here</a>. We also have this <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac/buy-apple-refurbished-3448814/">advice about buying a refurbished Mac.</a></p>
