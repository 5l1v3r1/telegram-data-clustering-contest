      <p>Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis has spotted a SIM deal that he described as the cheapest he has ever seen.</p>
      <p>The cash-saving guru appeared on This Morning to talk about the best Black Friday deals and picked out an £8 SIM deal from Three that he thinks is a bargain.</p>
      <p>The deal includes 8GB of data for the lowly <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=10210&amp;clickref=Tendendo-MartinLewis&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.three.co.uk%252FStore%252FSIM%252FPlans_for_phones%5D%5D">monthly price of just £8</a> and is one of the cheapest options on the market for those looking for a SIM-only deal, reports the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/martin-lewis-raves-super-cheap-20929192">Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>The deal is just one of a number of cheap SIM deals appearing on the Three website. It is also selling an <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=10210&amp;clickref=Tendendo-Three&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.three.co.uk%252FStore%252FSIM%252FPlans_for_phones%5D%5D">unlimited data SIM deal for £20</a> , which is an industry-leading price for unlimited data.</p>
      <p>Three has also promised the data usage will not be slowed down for heavy users, something other providers will sometimes do for those who watch a lot of streaming video or listen to music.</p>
      <p>In comparison Vodafone's unlimited data SIM deal costs <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=1257&amp;clickref=Tendendo-Vodafone&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.vodafone.co.uk%252Funlimited-data-plans%252F%5D%5D">£23 per month</a> and O2 charges from <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=3242&amp;clickref=Tendendo-O2&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.o2.co.uk%252Fshop%252Fsim-cards%252Fsim-only-deals%2523deviceType%253Dphone%2526contractLength%253DP18M%5D%5D">£33 per month</a> for unlimited data. EE is also selling an unlimited data SIM for a monthly price of <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=3516&amp;clickref=Tendendo-EESIMs&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fshop.ee.co.uk%252Fsim-only%252Fpay-monthly-phones%5D%5D">£34</a> .</p>
      <p>Martin Lewis also pointed out Boots' Black Friday beauty gift sets as an example of a strong Black Friday offer. He says the <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=2041&amp;clickref=Tendendo-MartinLewis&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.boots.com%252Fno7-the-beauty-wardrobe-gift-set-10268119%5D%5D">No7 Beauty Wardrobe set</a> is a bargain at £25. The price is reduced from £50 but the items within the set are actually worth £87.</p>
      <p>Black Friday takes place on 29 November this year but many retailers including Amazon and Currys PC World have already launched sales. Amazon in particular is holding eight days of discounts starting with reduced prices for the Amazon Echo Dot, Kindle and Fire Stick today.</p>
