      <h1>Chiefs’ Khune Update As Semi Beckons</h1>

      <p>With Daniel Akpeyi suspended for Kaizer Chiefs’ Telkom Knockout semi-final this weekend, there were hopes that Itumeleng Khune might make his return – Ernst Middendorp has given an update…</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Khune hasn’t played since September when he picked up a groin injury that saw Akpeyi stake his claim between the poles for the Glamour Boys in their impressive start to the season, but it had been hoped that the international break would give their captain time to recover. </p>
      <p>Now though, Middendorp has explained that they can’t ‘try to push him’, revealing that it will be Bruce Bvuma who starts in goal against Maritzburg United on Sunday, with Khune not yet ready to take his place in the matchday squad, let alone the starting XI. </p>
      <p>Middendorp told the media, "He’s training and trying to come closer. At a certain time, I see what he is delivering but I am waiting for feedback from the goalkeeper department, who can really say how far he is.</p>
      <p>"But in the moment, we can’t try to push him. We have to manage now this one game, and that’s it. It’s not possible to think about Itu Khune."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Brylon Petersen, who was only recently brought back to the club after he left at the end of the season, is expected to be on the bench as he goes almost straight back into the matchday squad following his return.  </p>
