      <h1>Check out Engadget's new deals hub!</h1>
      <h2>Just in time for Black Friday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/dana-wollman" target="_blank">Dana Wollman</a></address>
      <p>You may have already noticed, but Engadget has been spending more time lately writing about good deals we find. This week -- nay, month -- has already gotten a little intense in the lead-up to Black Friday, with some brands and retailers having launched "preview" sales the first week of November. Sheesh. Anyhow, you're going to be seeing us pay more attention to price drops going forward, so much so that we thought it was time we created <a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/">a hub</a> where all of our deals-related posts could be easily discoverable in one place.</p>
      <p>The hub sits in the top nav on our homepage. It's design is pretty self-explanatory: You'll see featured deals up top, with a reverse-chronological feed after that showing the most recent posts first. What needs more explanation, I think, is our approach to curating these deals. Our team homes in on products we've reviewed or had extensive hands-on time with. We need to have given it a warm write-up or a good score (80 or higher). If our earlier verdict was mixed, we'll still consider it <i>if</i> one of our main complaints was that it was too pricey at launch.</p>
      <p>Obviously, we also care when a major brand or retailer is having a blowout sale. Steam games. Best Buy's Labor Day event. You get the idea. Lastly, we take price history into account. It's not enough that something is being sold for less than its list price; we're looking for sale prices that represent a rare or record low.</p>
      <p>I want to be clear, too, that our editors enjoy the same editorial independence they do when they write on any other topic. They have no quotas, no revenue goals and no one can tell them to cover something they don't want to. Heck, I even got vetoed by my own news team on a particular price drop we were considering recently. I think that's healthy.</p>
      <p>Have a look around, bookmark this hub or our deals <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/engadgetdeals/">tag page</a>, and be sure to check back on Black Friday, a week from today.</p>
