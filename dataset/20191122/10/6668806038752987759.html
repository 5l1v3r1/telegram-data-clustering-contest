      <p>Christmas is only a month away and our excitement is double-fold this year because superstar Salman Khan is coming back to the big screen as Chulbul Pandey with Dabangg 3. A blockbuster franchise, Dabangg 3 takes you back into the life of a young Chulbul and narrates the story of how he became Robin Hood Pandey. We are also introduced to his first love, played by debutante Saiee Manjrekar.</p>

      <p>While the film will have a lot of flashbacks, we are super stoked to see Salman and Sonakshi bring back the Chulbul -Rajjo romance once again on the screen. After serenading Rajjo with Tere Mast Mast Do Nain in the first instalment, we will be seeing a naughty side of this onscreen couple in Dabangg 3. Giving us a glimpse of the same, Salman Khan just dropped the new song, Yu Karke, and its super fiery.</p>
      <p>Sung by the superstar himself, Yu Karke is a break from the storyline of the film and has Sonakshi and Salman grooving in exotic locations. Also keeping up with the tradition, the song has a difficult hook step that Salman doesÂ  effortlessly.</p>
