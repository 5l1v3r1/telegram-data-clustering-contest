      <h3>A team of engineers from the University of the Philippines-College of Engineering (UP-CoE), headed by UP-CoE Dean Ferdie Manegdeg, ensured the safety of Mindanaoans right after a series of earthquakes and strong aftershocks hit the Province of Cotabato recently.</h3>
      <p>Immediately after the devastation, the Manegdeg-led volunteers rushed to aid the hard-hit City of Kidapawan and Municipality of Makilala by conducting needed structural assessment of its vital infrastructure and facilities.</p>
      <p>“As representatives of the premier State University, it is our important duty and responsibility to genuinely serve the people by providing the necessary support and assistance based on our competence and expertise,” Dean Manegdeg said.</p>
      <p>According to Maneg-deg, the free services by the UP-CoE were carried out in coordination with the provincial and municipal local government units and the team inspected main structures from November 9 to November 11, determining whether these could be reoccupied, should be restricted, or declared off limits.</p>
      <p>Among those examined were government and office buildings, gymnasiums, evacuation centers, hotels, commercial establishments, condominiums, and a bridge.</p>
      <p>In Kidapawan City, one building was assessed safe to be reoccupied, ten buildings were restricted from access and three were declared off limits. In the Municipality of Makilala, on the other hand, three buildings were restricted from access and two were declared off limits, including the municipal hall after serious damages were detected on the columns in its basement. Tuluan Bridge was also checked and determined that the integrity of its structural frame was not compromised, but the cracks on the abutment must be repaired.</p>
      <p>Aside from Dean Manegdeg, other team members were Civil Engineers Jaime Hernandez Jr., Eric Augustus Tingatinga, Jihan Pacer, Julius Rey Baniqued, and Geodetic Engineer Christian Candido who worked hand in hand with Cotabato Vice Governor Emmylou Taliño-Mendoza; Kidapawan City Mayor Joseph Evangelista; Municipality of Makilala Mayor Armando Quibod; Kidapawan City Administrator Lou Mayormita; and local Engineers led by Kidapawan Engineers Silverio Teofilo Jr. and Gilmor Catacutan, and Makilala Engineer Alfredo Enero.</p>
