      <h1>Another round of huge Fallout 76 fixes are on the way</h1>
      <h2>Post-Update 15</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:30</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Carter</a></address>
      <p><i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-fallout-76-532956.phtml">Fallout 76</a></i> has bugs. It's had bugs since launch. It had bugs before it launched that weren't fixed. It may always have bugs. Welcome to the wasteland.</p>
      <p>Did you enjoy my poem? Same.</p>
      <p>Although Bethesda pushed Update 15 out into the wild, <i>Fallout 76</i> still has some bugs to fix. As they put it "[the update] did not contain as many bug fixes as you had hoped." How many did you hope for, people? <b>All of them</b>?! Such high expectations for a $60 game with microtransactions and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../fallout-76-reveals-paid-subscription-service-fallout-1st-570327.phtml">a subscription service</a>.</p>
      <p>Alas more bug fixes are coming, and they're coming soon. Bethesda says that they're going to be more transparent when it comes to these issues, not just providing updates for upcoming content, but fixes like the below list. The main takeaways are that automatic weapons are going to be less buggy when aiming down sights, Power Armor and jetpacks shouldn't create a hilarious <i>Looney Tunes</i> blast off situation, and corpses shouldn't disappear from the world randomly.</p>
      <p>That last one is crucial and arguably my number one complaint this past year. Keep fixing and when the NPC update comes, maybe it'll be a proper <i>Fallout!</i></p>

        <b>Upcoming Community Bug Fixes:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Disappearing Corpses: The dead should stay put—especially when there’s loot to be had! We’ve internally addressed an issue that could sometimes cause enemy corpses to suddenly vanish, and we want to get this fix to you as soon as we can.</li>
        <li>+250 Damage Resist: The legendary weapon effect that provides +250 damage resistance while aiming is being addressed. With this upcoming fix, it will no longer suppress the weapon’s primary legendary attribute.</li>
        <li>Sliding Enemies: Some of you have encountered enemies like Ghouls and Scorched that occasionally glide rigidly over the terrain. While that’s eerie in its own way, these creatures are more frightening when they’re chasing you on their own two feet. We are going to make sure they get their animations back.</li>
        <li>Jumps and Jetpacks: For those of you who rock a jetpack on your Power Armor, we have a fix so that performing a normal jump will no longer send you sky-high by sometimes activating the jetpack.</li>
        <li>Automatic Weapon Fire: When it comes time to fire your weapon in the Wasteland, you need to be able to rely on it. Automatic weapons, like the Gatling Guns, are being fixed so they no longer fail to fire if you aim down the sights while the barrel is spinning.</li>
      </ul>
