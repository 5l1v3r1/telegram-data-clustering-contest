      <p>As many as 15 trade agreements worth more than $100m have been signed between Indonesian businesses and their Qatari counterparts during the first Indonesia Expo 2019 which was held at the InterContinental Hotel Doha The City from November 17-19.</p>
      <p>Indonesia’s Ambassador to Qatar Muhammad Basri Sidehabi witnessed the signing of the agreements which included commitment for products trading, investment, and partnership.</p>
      <p>The event, dubbed as the first solo Indonesian products exhibition in Qatar, was inaugurated by Qatar Chamber Official Saad Al Dabbagh and President of Qatar-Indonesia Business Council (QIBC) Farhan Al Sayed in the presence of the Indonesian Ambassador and 60 dignitaries from the diplomatic and business communities in Qatar.</p>
      <p>Over 600 visitors also attended the event, which featured as many as 45 Indonesian companies and two Indonesian cooperatives, and was supported by the Indonesian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (KADIN) and its Aceh Province Regional Chapter, which brought opportunities for the business community in Qatar to explore trade and investment potential between the two countries. Participants also engaged in Business to Business Matchmaking which resulted in several business deals.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the expo, Sidehabi said he hoped that the exhibition would open more access for business communities from the two countries to expand their cooperation in all sectors of economy, not only in trade exchange but also in attracting more investment, collaboration, and partnership for the benefit of the two brotherly countries.</p>
      <p>Referring to the theme of the expo ‘Gateway to Indonesian Products’, the Indonesian Ambassador reiterated the importance of sustained efforts towards concrete business and economic cooperation.</p>
      <p>Al Sayed added that Qatar and Indonesia will have a very diversified business relations in the future.</p>
      <p>He went on to thank the Indonesian Ambassador and the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia for organising the event, and reiterated the important and strategic partnership between Qatar and Indonesia, considering that Indonesia is a G-20 member, the largest economy of ASEAN members, and the largest Muslim populated country in the world.  The expo also featured a number of cultural performances.</p>
