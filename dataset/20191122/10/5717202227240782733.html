      <h1>Report: Leeds reignite interest in Burnley striker Matej Vydra</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:15:02+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/?service=responsive">The Daily Mirror have claimed</a> in their paper edition (November 22, page 74) that Leeds United are interested in signing Burnley striker Matej Vydra – reigniting previous interest in the Czech Republic international.</p>
      <p>Vydra, 27, was constantly being linked with a move to Elland Road in the summer of 2018. The striker netted 22 goals in 44 league and cup appearances, and Marcelo Bielsa wanted the striker to spearhead his assault on Championship promotion.</p>
      <p>However, Leeds were eventually put off by Vydra’s wage demands and they ended up signing Patrick Bamford from Middlesbrough. The ex-Watford man moved to the Premier League with Sean Dyche’s Burnley.</p>
      <p>Burnley splashed £11million (<a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/soccer-transfers/story/3588505/burnley-snap-up-czech-striker-matej-vydra-from-derby-county">ESPN</a>) to sign Vydra just under 18 months ago, but he has since managed just 22 appearances for the Clarets. Indeed, he has scored two goals – only one of which has come in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>It is believed Burnley are willing to listen to offers worth £7.5million for Vydra this summer, and Leeds are said to be looking to bring the Championship goal machine to Elland Road. He is earning £35,000 a week, <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/epl/burnley-f.c/payroll/">as per Spotrac.</a></p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Vydra would be excellent, but is he worth as much as £7.5m?</h3>
      <p>Vydra has scored 65 goals in 187 Championship appearances throughout his career – averaging about a goal every three games. Is that record enough to take Leeds into the Premier League after a 16-year wait?</p>
      <p>Certainly, with the amount of chances Leeds create, it would certainly see Vydra score regularly. But at a whopping £7.5million, Leeds can do a lot better. The question mark also remains whether he would contribute to play as much as Bamford.</p>
