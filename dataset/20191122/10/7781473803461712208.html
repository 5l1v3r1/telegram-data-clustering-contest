      <p>Statistics indicate that India witnesses 1,49,000 road accidents and fatalities per year out of which 8 per cent are kids under the age of 14. The Indian government aims to bring the number down to half by the year 2020.</p>
      <p>ZF, the German automobile component makers have also taken the initiative to spread road safety awareness throughout the nation and have employed a 'Safety Bunny' (ZF's mascot) for the same.</p>

      <p>The Safety Bunny is hopping from city to city to educate the kids between the age of 5-10 years. The bunny has already taught 20,000 kids about the traffic rules and Road Safety in the cities of Pune, Hyderabad, Coimbatore, Chennai and Delhi. The campaign is a mix of interactive sessions, live demonstrations, providing special material and games.</p>
      <p>Suresh KV, Head of ZF India Pvt. Ltd. said: "With the clear target to bolster the efforts on improving safety and to create a bright future with zero accidents amidst the changing landscape of the automotive world, we at ZF, are leveraging our leadership in driveline and chassis technology as well as active and passive safety technologies to bring a lot of innovative vehicle safety solutions into the Indian Market. While technology will do its part in ensuring road safety, our responsibility also extends in changing the casual mindsets of motorists towards traffic safety rules and practices. We believe if we start at a tender age and teach children about the right road practices, this will heavily contribute to a world with zero accidents that we are targeting for our future."</p>
