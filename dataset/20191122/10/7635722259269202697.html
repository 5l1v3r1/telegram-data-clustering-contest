        <b>Mary Lou McDonald has said the attempted murder of Arlene Foster’s father during the Troubles was “wrong.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking to Pat Kenny on <i>Newstalk</i> this morning, the Sinn Féin leader stopped short of condemning the attack.</p>
      <p>She said that singling out one act of violence would lead to ongoing calls for comment on others.</p>
      <p>“The politics of condemnation is a rabbit-hole that I will not go down because it becomes a tit-for-tat, ‘you said, I said,’” she explained.</p>
      <p>“I think that serves nobody. We need to deal with the past with compassion.”</p>

      <p>The issue was raised after Deputy McDonald called on unionist leaders to condemn a number of loyalist banners that appeared in Belfast making allegations against Sinn Féin candidate for North Belfast, John Finucane.</p>
      <p>Mrs Foster said the call was a “bit rich” and urged Sinn Féin to comment on the attempted murder of her father in 1979 and an attack on her party’s current deputy leader Nigel Dodds in 1996.</p>
      <p>Deputy McDonald said the attack was “wrong” and the violence during the Troubles was “absolutely tragic.”</p>
      <p>“It was wrong that Arlene Foster as a child – that any child – witnessed that kind of violence visited on their father,” she said.</p>
      <p>“It was wrong that John Finucane – which is where this conversation started, this run of things started – that he saw his father shot dead and his mother wounded.</p>
      <p>“All of that is just absolutely awful and tragic and cannot happen again.”</p>

      <p>The PSNI is investigating the banners which made a series of allegations against Mr Finucane and his family – including his father who was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries.</p>
      <p>Mr Finucane, the current Lord Mayor of Belfast, is running against Mr Dodds in one of the North’s closest constituencies.</p>
      <p>Mr Dodds has condemned the posters and insisted that they had nothing to do with the DUP.</p>
      <p>Mrs Foster’s father was a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary police force when he was shot at his family farm by Republican paramilitaries in 1979.</p>
      <p>He was shot in the head but survived the attack.</p>
      <p>A policeman was injured in an attack on Mr Dodds as he visited his son at the Royal Children’s Hospital in Belfast in 1996.</p>
