      <p><b>BELLEFONTE, Pa. (AP) — </b>Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky is expected in a Pennsylvania courtroom to be resentenced after an appeals court said mandatory minimum sentences had been improperly applied against him.</p>
      <p>The 75-year-old Sandusky will be resentenced Friday by Judge Maureen Skerda at the county courthouse in Bellefonte.</p>
      <p>State Superior Court in February rejected many of Sandusky’s arguments but determined the sentencing was flawed.</p>
      <p>Sandusky was convicted of 45 counts of child sexual abuse in 2012 and sentenced to 30 to 60 years. It’s unclear whether Skerda will issue a significantly different sentence.</p>
      <p>Court filings in recent week indicate that there may also be argument about Sandusky’s designation as a sexually violent predator.</p>
