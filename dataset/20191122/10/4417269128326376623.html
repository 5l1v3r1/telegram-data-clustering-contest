      <h1>Amanzimtoti’s Erasmus sisters blast out the water</h1>
      <h2>In preparation for the inter-provincial tournament, the sisters are training four times a week.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:00:57+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Earl Baillache</a></address>
      <p>Amanzimtoti water stars Jessica, 16, and Stephanie Erasmus, 13, have been selected for KZN waterpolo teams for the second consecutive year.  The sisters, who play for Amanzimtoti High School, made the KZN U15 and U13 teams and have been invited to go on tour in December.</p>
      <p>Jessica is a Grade 9 learner at the school, while Stephanie is finishing Grade 7 at Kuswag before accepting a full scholarship to join her sister next year. They are the only two girls from Amanzimtoti who have been selected to the KZN A teams this year.</p>

      <p>Last year Jessica was chosen as a non-travelling reserve for the SA U15 team and hopes to be chosen as a traveller this year. “They will choose the SA team after an inter-provincial tournament taking place in Johannesburg from 7 to 11 December. I hope I make the squad and I’ve been working hard for it.”</p>
      <p>They are both totally committed to waterpolo, so much so that this year that had to make a decision to drop canoeing to concentrate on their chosen sport. “We don’t miss canoeing. We never liked the marathons, only the sprints,” said Stephanie, who won the McGregor surfski series two years ago, and along with the title a customised canoe and sponsored paddles.</p>

      <p>In preparation for the inter-provincial tournament, the sisters are training four times a week with their teams, travelling to Durban, Umhlanga, Kloof and Pietermaritzburg. “I feel much more comfortable in the team this year. We know more about how to play with each other,” said Jessica. “We have some new players and some I have played with before, so it’s a bit more difficult for me,” said Stephanie.</p>
      <p>Having a clinic with an SA coach in June and July helped them progress tremendously. Jessica said they are aiming for top spot after finishing fourth last year and the U13s want to end in the top three.</p>
      <p>Stephanie plays hole guard or hole man, while Jessica can play anywhere, but prefers wing or fetch. There are 14 players in a waterpolo team, but only seven, including a goalkeeper, are allowed in the pool at once. A match is divided into four five-to-eight minute chakras.</p>
      <p>Jessica plays squash in the off-season to keep fit and both prefer lazing in the pool or kicking a rugby ball around for fun. Asked what they enjoy about their sport, Stephanie was quick to answer: “The rough stuff” while Jessica said: “I just like being in water.”</p>
