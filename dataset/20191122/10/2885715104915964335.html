      <h1>Watch: Rohit Sharma, Wriddhiman Saha take stunning diving catches against Bangladesh</h1>
      <h2>Mominul tried to defend, got a thick edge, the ball flew but Rohit Sharma was alert enough to fly to his right and he caught it one-handed.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:58:53+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/sports-desk/" target="_blank">Sports Desk</a></address>
      <p>India’s maiden pink-ball Test at Eden Gardens began Friday and featured a stunning catch from <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rohit-sharma/">Rohit Sharma</a> in the slips during the first inning. Standing at second slip, Sharma literally snatched the catch before it reached <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/virat-kohli/">Virat Kohli</a> at first slip.</p>
      <p>Having lost the first wicket of Imrul Kayes for 15, Bangladesh were trying to control the damage. Bu skipper Mominul Haque had no answer to <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/umesh-yadav/">Umesh Yadav</a>’s angling-in delivery, which caught the edge and ended up in a diving Sharma’s right hand. It was the first ball of 11th over.</p>

      <p>It’s a challenge to catch at slip with the pink ball but Rohit ensured he had soft hands on that one for it to stick.</p>
      <p>Then there was another stunner, taken by Wriddhiman Saha in a similar manner. Again, the ball was going towards Kohli, but Saha took a diving one-handed catch. The Indian wicketkeeper emerged with the ball stuck in the webbing of the glove between the thumb and forefinger.</p>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ishant-sharma/">Ishant Sharma</a> had got the ball to straighten a touch, it found the edge of Mahmudullah’s bat, and then Saha took the spectacular catch.</p>

      <p>Winning the toss, Bangladesh elected to bat, only to see their top and middle order demolished by India’s fast bowlers.</p>
