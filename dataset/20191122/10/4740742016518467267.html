      <h1>South Gloucestershire Council paid out £1million in redundancies in 12 months</h1>
      <h2>Chiefly because of large payments made to three individuals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:06:10+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:06</time> by <a rel="author">Amanda Cameron</a></address>
      <p>South Gloucestershire Council racked up around £1million in redundancy payouts last year, despite laying of almost 100 fewer staff than the year before.</p>
      <p>The authority made 125 people redundant in 2017/18, at a cost of roughly £1.6million.</p>
      <p>Last year, there were only 30 compulsory redundancies, but they added up to around £1million - chiefly because of large payments made to three individuals.</p>
      <p>The unnamed individuals received a payout of between £150,001 and 200,000 each in the year to April 2019, the council’s annual report for the year shows.</p>
      <p>Another three got between £40,001 and £80,000, while the remaining 24 received up to £40,000.</p>
      <p>By contrast, in 2017/18, the highest redundancy payout was in the range £80,001 to £100,000, and went to one person only. Twelve others received £40,001 to £80,000 and the remaining 113 got up to £40,000.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/south-gloucestershire-council">council</a> spokesman said: “There were a number of redundancies in 2018/19, following reorganisation within the council as part of our ongoing work to improve the value for money as we continue to deliver our priorities and the services people need. </p>
      <p>“A number of individuals received contractual redundancy payments as part of this process, which are capped by the council’s policy. </p>
      <p>“The total costs to the council (described as ‘exit packages’) includes pension costs payable to the pension fund to comply with pension rules.”</p>
      <p>Altogether the council forked out almost £1.25million in severance payments in 2018/19, compared with nearly £2.05million the previous financial year.</p>
      <p>As well as forced redundancies, exit packages of up to £40,000 for staff who left for other reasons were paid to 15 people last year and 22 the previous year.</p>
      <p>The council was restructured in 2013.</p>
      <p>It paid out nearly £15million making staff redundant in the seven years to 2017/18, but it saved the same amount from its annual wage bill.</p>
