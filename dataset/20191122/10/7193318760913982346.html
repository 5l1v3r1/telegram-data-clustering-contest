        <b>'Frozen II'</b>
      </p>
      <p>PG 1:44 3 of 4 stars</p>
      <p>For a reminder of how significant the ice — er, ground — that Disney's 2013 animated blockbuster "Frozen" was able to break, look no further than the memes.</p>
      <p>One that has popped in my news feeds lately features Queen Elsa sending a bevy of Disney Princesses sobbing into their pillows by coolly declaring "You can't marry a man you just met." Thankfully, the long-awaited sequel continues to chip away at some of the outdated notions featured in many of the Mouse House's fairy-tale films.</p>
      <p>A visually stunning epic adventure, "Frozen II" finds its heroes settled three years after the events of the first film: Elsa (Idina Menzel) has learned to control her icy powers and peacefully governs the Kingdom of Arendelle, with her sister Princess Anna (Kristen Bell) relishing their close relationship. Anna's romance with affable ice harvester Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) is still going strong; he is ready to get married, but his many wrongheaded attempts to propose become one of the movie's funniest gags.</p>
      <p>The other source of near-nonstop hilarity is the magical snowman Olaf (Josh Gad), who, having survived into autumn, is obsessed with the wisdom of age. He's constantly spouting dubious facts, but one turns out to be true: water has memory.</p>
      <p>The unconventional royal family learns that tidbit in rather dramatic fashion when Elsa is pulled north by a mysterious, mystical call to an ancient forest enveloped in a mist impenetrable to everyone except the ice queen.</p>
      <p>When Elsa uses her magic to part the cloud, they find the woods inhabited by destructive spirits of nature, plus a contingent of Arendelle's soldiers, who have been trapped in uneasy coexistence with members of the magic-using Northuldra tribe. The two groups have been stranded in the woods for 34 years, since the two kingdoms' attempts to broker peace went suspiciously array and angered the sorcerous forest, leading to the magical lockdown.</p>
      <p>With her family's help, Elsa must plumb the depths of her enigmatic powers and go on a treacherous quest to uncover the past and appease the restless spirits.</p>
      <p>"Frozen II" boasts a convoluted story with a few plot holes, but returning co-writers and directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee deserve credit for crafting a sequel that seeks to answer the most compelling questions left by "Frozen." The sequel's sly joke about the ubiquitous "Let It Go" aside, Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez also return with more catchy songs.</p>
      <p>"Frozen II" makes room for romance, but rather than forcing it like past Disney Princess movies, the sequel keeps blazing a trail by letting its characters have love and adventure, too.</p>

        <b>'A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood'</b>
      </p>
      <p>PG 1:48 3 1/2 of 4 stars</p>
      <p>Director Marielle Heller frames " A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood " as if it were an episode of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood," with miniature sets of cars and bridges to illustrate New York and Pittsburgh. Mr. Rogers, played with clear-eyed purpose by Tom Hanks, introduces the audience to the film's protagonist, journalist Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys), using his "picture window" in that all-too-familiar living room where he's just changed into his sneakers and sweater. It's even rated PG.</p>
      <p>But "A Beautiful Day" is not really a children's story at all. It's a story about a man who suffers from the doubly impossible combination of being an adult and an investigative journalist. In other words, he's the person least likely to be charmed by the straightforward sincerity of someone like Fred Rogers.</p>
      <p>The film is loosely based on Tom Junod's article "Can You Say...'Hero'?" which appeared in Esquire Magazine in November of 1998. Junod has said that spending time with the then 70-year-old changed him. Cynical at first, the two formed a friendship — Junod's first ever with a subject — that would last until Rogers' death in 2003.</p>
      <p>The similarities stop there and the film veers off in its own direction, adding drama and elements that are not part of Junod's life at all (like getting into a fistfight with his father at his sister's wedding, neither of which happened). But as Junod writes in The Atlantic this month, the film "seems like a culmination of the gifts that Fred Rogers gave me and all of us, gifts that fit the definition of grace because they feel, at least in my case, undeserved."</p>
      <p>Essentially, Fred Rogers' lessons can apply to adults too. And "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood" spins its magic to show (not just tell) us how, no matter if it's mostly a fiction from the minds of screenwriters Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster.</p>
      <p>The film introduces Lloyd at a particularly unstable moment. He's got a newborn son with his wife, Andrea (an understated and excellent Susan Kelechi Watson), and his long-estranged father (Chris Cooper) has suddenly started trying to come back into his life. It's under these high-pressure circumstances that his editor (Christine Lahti) assigns him to write a "small piece" about Fred Rogers for the magazine's "heroes issue." Lloyd scoffs at what he considers a demeaning assignment. He's there to be an investigative journalist and the host of a cheesy children's show is, he thinks, below him. Andrea even asks her husband, knowing what kind of writer he is, to please not ruin her childhood.</p>
      <p>He remains skeptical even upon meeting Fred and goes back to his editor to ask for more time, saying that he "just doesn't think he's for real." Sure, part of you is probably thinking Lloyd a monster. But consider Lloyd's point of view too: Fred uses puppets during his interview and deflects quite a bit on the more pressing questions, often diverting and asking about his interviewer instead of answering.</p>
      <p>And yet, his goodness starts to transcend all of that. Heller does a marvelous job illustrating the effect Fred has on those around him. Even the production staff who he infuriates with his tendency to veer off schedule by spending a little too long with visitors, falls in line when he starts to work his singular magic in front of the camera. They know they're making something special.</p>
      <p>One scene, that seems almost too schmaltzy to be true, in which a subway car full of adults and children starts serenading Fred with his theme song, actually happened.</p>
      <p>Hanks is such an obvious choice to play someone as beloved as Fred Rogers that his performance is something that could be in danger of being taken for granted or overlooked. He just makes it all look so easy — the almost uncomfortably slow way that he speaks. But it's a testament to Hanks that you can't "see" the work. But much like Fred Rogers, you don't have to understand it to be moved.</p>
      <p>"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood," a Sony Pictures release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America for "some strong thematic material, a brief fight, and some mild language." Running time: 108 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.</p>

        <b>'21 Bridges'</b>
      </p>
      <p>R 1:39 2 1/2 of 4 stars</p>
      <p>The movie "21 Bridges" opens with a bang. Not literally — it's just a close-up of a 13-year-old boy's tear-streaked face, as he listens to the off-camera sermon delivered at his father's funeral. We learn that Dad, a New York City cop, has been killed in the line of duty, but not before he "punished" three of the four criminals he was pursuing.</p>
      <p>It's an artful — and telling — moment, not only for the image's simplicity, emotional power and good casting. Playing Andre, the young actor, Christian Isaiah, really looks like he could grow up to be Chadwick Boseman, who later portrays NYPD detective Andre "Dre" Davis as a grown man. It also sets the stage for the rest of the overly schematic but reasonably watchable film, with the erroneous assumption that it's the role of the police to not just enforce the law but to mete out harsh justice for those who break it.</p>
      <p>Dre, of course, who is the film's hero, doesn't really believe that, but people think he does. The second scene in the film shows him in front of an Internal Affairs panel that is investigating his propensity for discharging his firearm on the job. And when eight cops and a civilian are killed in the robbery of a wine store with a freezer full of 300 kilos of cocaine — only 50 of which are actually taken — Dre's presumptive trigger-happiness is what gets him assigned to the case by the captain of the precinct whose officers were gunned down (J.K. Simmons).</p>
      <p>Dre, it is assumed, will find the perps and, you know, save us all the headache and heartache of endless appeals and plea bargains with a strategic bullet or two. He is assisted in the hunt by a DEA agent (Sienna Miller, with whom Boseman has an unfortunate lack of chemistry).</p>
      <p>Ah, but chemistry — or, for that matter, character development — is not what "21 Bridges" is about. It is a game of hide-and-seek, as Dre quickly convinces the police brass and the FBI, who convince the mayor, to shut down Manhattan: every bridge, tunnel, train track and river into and out of the city, for a window of a few short hours while he uses his almost superhuman deductive skills to tighten the noose around the perps. (Taylor Kitsch plays the cop killer, and Stephan James is his more reluctant — and less bloodthirsty — partner).</p>
      <p>It's a pretty artificial, not to mention absurd, scenario, as Dre goes after his quarry with speed and success that is surprising even for someone with his Sherlock Holmes-like forensic powers. Soon enough, it becomes apparent to him — and to us — that there is a setup going on, as he observes very early in the film.</p>
      <p>It isn't hard to figure out who's behind it, if you've seen a million of these things.</p>
      <p>And there have been a lot of them. "21 Bridges" will win no prizes for originality or twists. (It won't win any prizes for anything, to be honest.) But it's made well enough. Brothers Joe and Anthony Russo ("Avengers: Endgame") are the producers, and Irish director Brian Kirk ("Games of Thrones") knows how to keep an old jalopy like this well-oiled to get us across the finish line.</p>
      <p>In other words, "21 Bridges" gets the job done. So does Boseman, who is satisfying to watch, even when he has little to do except the right thing. Dre isn't tarnished or tainted in any way. He's not guilt-ridden, seeking redemption or complicated. "21 Bridges" might be a teeny bit more interesting if he were.</p>

        <b>'Gift'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not rated 1:30 2 1/2 of 4 stars</p>
      <p>In the film "Gift," we are introduced to four fascinating real people: Lee Mingwei, Giorgio De Finis, Marcus Alfred and Michelle Lessans.</p>
      <p>Born in Taiwan, Lee is a globe-trotting artist who creates participatory installations and art actions, such as "Sonic Blossom," in which museumgoers in New York, Cleveland, Paris and other cities were treated to quasi-private recitals by talented singers wandering through galleries.</p>
      <p>De Finis is an Italian curator of contemporary art who has helped transform a former sausage factory in Rome — also home to some 200 squatters — into an inhabited art space known as the Museum of the Other and the Elsewhere of Metropoliz.</p>
      <p>Alfred is an indigenous Kwakwaka'wakw carver from British Columbia who gives away a large part of the fruits of his labor at his people's annual potlatch gathering.</p>
      <p>Lessans, who goes by the nickname Smallfry, is a Bay Area beekeeper who, a few years ago, created Beezus Christ Super Car, a bee-shaped vehicle built — at Oakland's NIMBY maker space — to dispense honey and mead at the Burning Man festival.</p>
      <p>Most of these details emerge only gradually — if at all — in this unorthodox documentary (though "nonfiction essay" is probably a better description of its form and intent). There are no on-screen titles identifying names, places or dates — most of the previous paragraph I looked up online — but the film's unifying message is clear: All its subjects are involved in giving something away.</p>
      <p>The film was inspired by Lewis Hyde's 1983 book "The Gift," which explored the notion of the gift economy in a cultural context, and director Robin McKenna sprinkles enigmatic lines from the book through the movie, such as "The imagination creates the future."</p>
      <p>But "Gift" can be a little frustrating at times. Its central point is like a Zen koan: As Alfred puts it at one point, "We're giving away everything we have to become wealthy." It's a neat paradox, and it prompts an intriguing question: What is the value of art? Lee says he doesn't have an answer, and neither does the film. McKenna is more interested in leaving the question hanging. (In one exchange, Lee folds paper money into origami and gives it away, inviting the recipient to do anything she wants with it, including spend it. To be honest, it's probably now more valuable as art than cash.)</p>
      <p>But important little details, like how bills are paid — there are always bills — are kept deliberately, and sometimes maddeningly, vague. Smallfry has a day job as a social worker, as it turns out. Alfred's art is highly collectible. Lee's works are underwritten by corporations and wealthy donors. And De Finis, who works as a museum director, invites the residents of Metropoliz — who face the constant threat of eviction — to help maintain the art space, which also solicits donations from visitors. The popularity of Metropoliz as a cultural destination, in fact, is probably what keeps the police from kicking out the families who live there. The unnamed little girl who acts as a tour guide to the space is, by the way, adorable.</p>
      <p>"Gift" doesn't really get into such unpleasant details as financing, and that's OK. The idea that culture has a value beyond cash — that both sides of the equation, both the getters and the givers, are enriched by something that doesn't have a price tag, or at least not an obvious one — is a beautiful thought. It applies just as easily to, say, the Smithsonian as to a cup of honey wine from a woman in an art-car. It may even be the real art here.</p>

        <b>'Frankie'</b>
      </p>
      <p>PG-13 1:38 3 of 4 stars</p>
      <p>At times, the vacationing family at the center of "Frankie" seems to have chosen its picturesque setting - Sintra, Portugal — less for its beauty than its ability to encourage simmering tensions to bubble to the surface.</p>
      <p>At least that's what a viewer might take away from "Frankie," a family drama from director Ira Sachs and co-writer Mauricio Zacharias, his frequent collaborator. Most of the story elements — a looming cancer diagnosis, emotional distance between spouses, sibling rivalry — will be familiar to even the most casual filmgoer. But thanks to a superb cast and a welcome strain of comedic energy, "Frankie" turns out to be more than a pretty travelogue with melodrama.</p>
      <p>At the head of the cast is Isabelle Huppert, playing the title character, a well-known screen actress who has called her family together in Sintra for a host of reasons, some of which will remain opaque until the film's final act. Huppert is one of today's most versatile actors; just contrast her over-the-top performance in this year's schlocky psychological thriller "Greta" with her acting here, which consists largely of silent grimaces that speak volumes. The film's placid pace mirrors her contemplative state.</p>
      <p>The gathering is a large — and slightly convoluted — one, and includes Frankie's ex-husband Michel (Pascal Greggory), who has come out as gay, and their son Paul (Jérémie Renier); as well as her current husband Jimmy (an underutilized Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter from an earlier relationship, Sylvia (Vinette Robinson). Sylvia is mulling a divorce from her husband (Ariyon Bakare), who comes off like a man who knows something is amiss but won't admit it. Their restless daughter (Sennia Nanua) takes off on a day trip to the beach, where she meets a handsome stranger.</p>
      <p>And that's not all: Frankie hopes to fix Paul up with a hairstylist friend (Marisa Tomei), who — to Frankie's dismay — has been joined in Sintra by a well-intentioned if clueless suitor (Greg Kinnear). Luminous as always, Tomei enlivens all of her scenes, whether reacting to her gentleman friend's shambling advances, a sudden revelation of sad news or the suggestion that she marry Paul. "Could you see yourself getting married?" Paul asks her. "Not to you," she replies, wincing.</p>
      <p>In one of the movie's few nods to the outside world, two of the characters are said to be taking a break from the set of a new "Star Wars" film. At times "Frankie" seems to be on the verge of social satire, highlighting the characters' economic privilege. But Sachs and Zacharias fail to place their story firmly in the context of the wider world. When a tour guide (Carloto Cotta) shows up, it is largely to comment on the turbulent family dynamics.</p>
      <p>Much of the movie's pleasures lie closer to the surface. Admirers of Sachs' previous films (including "Love Is Strange" and "Little Men") will recognize his affinity for brevity and a hushed affect.</p>
      <p>In the end, the film — which never leaves the vacation compound — robs viewers of closure. Instead of lapsing into rote sentimentality, Sachs suggests that the characters may have resolved — or perhaps simply accepted — their differences, out of earshot.</p>
      <p>The movie doesn't tie things up neatly. But as the camera pulls back, we are treated to something pretty: one last wide shot of that marvelous pale blue sky.</p>
