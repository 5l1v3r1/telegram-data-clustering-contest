      <p>If you’re in the market for a job that will allow you to cuddle up to two golden retrievers every day, the perfect role has just opened up.</p>
      <p>A high-flying couple who travel a lot are looking for someone to become a live-in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/%3Ca%20href=">dog</a> carer and look after for their pets full-time.</p>
      <p>Not only will you get a decent salary of between £30,000 to £32,000 per year, but you’ll also get to live in their plush, six-storey townhouse in Kensington.</p>
      <p>You’ll be responsible for taking care of golden retrievers Milo and Oscar, taking them for morning and evening walks, managing all dog appointments, insurances and provisioning, as well as liaising with the regular dog walker.</p>
      <p>There’s just one teeny, tiny catch: you also have to do housekeeping.</p>
      <p>The job, advertised on <a href="https://www.silverswanrecruitment.com/">Silver Swan Recruitment</a>, is part dog nanny, part cleaner with daily housekeeping, laundry as required, food shopping and errands also included in the job description.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you need to maintain the ‘general management of the property’, welcome guests and take calls, and occasionally cook light evening meals for a vegan.</p>
      <p>You might also get roped into ‘assisting in other areas of the household when needed’, though it’s not specified what this entails, and teamwork is key to ‘ensure everything is done to the highest possible standard’.</p>
      <p>To be in with a chance to get the gig, you must not only have a passion for pooches but prior experience in looking after dogs is ‘essential’, and the ideal candidate will also have good housekeeping experience.</p>
      <p>The couple ask that all applicants be ‘fit and active’ and ‘hard-working and trustworthy’.</p>
      <p>Cooking experience isn’t required, but could give you an edge, and the working days are Monday to Friday, with occasional weekends.</p>
      <p>We’re going to go out on a limb here and say this job isn’t just about cosy dog cuddles.</p>
      <p>Then again, Milo and Oscar are part of the package and you do get to live in a luxury mansion, so if you don’t mind a bit of cleaning on the side, <a href="https://www.silverswansearch.com/jobs/dog-carer-housekeeper-in-kensington">go for it</a>.</p>
