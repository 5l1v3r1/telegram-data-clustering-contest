      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:36:42+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:36</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>A British doctor and his fiancée were found with their throats slashed and their hands cuffed behind their backs after being <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/murder">murdered</a> by a former doorman, a court heard.</p>
      <p>Police shot and wounded suspect Bampumim Teixeira as they discovered the bodies of Dr Richard Field, 49, and Dr Lina Bolanos, 38, inside their luxury penthouse.</p>
      <p>Teixeira, 32, is accused of murdering the couple, who worked as anaesthesiologists, in a planned burglary at their home in the US city of Boston, Massachusetts, on May 5, 2017.</p>
      <p>Jurors were told that Teixeira lurked outside the Macallen Building for more than two hours until he seized on an opportunity to make it past security without being noticed.</p>

      <p>Opening the case on Thursday, John Pappas, prosecuting, told the court that Teixeira followed a car into the building's garage just before 4pm and then went to the couple's penthouse on the 11th floor through an unlocked stairway.</p>
      <p>Dr Bolanos arrived home just under an hour later and was ambushed at her front door, the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/11/21/opening-statements-due-trial-man-accused-killing-two-doctors-their-south-boston-home/cf5wCQzbX608orOGK2dxwK/story.html">Boston Globe</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Her partner was stabbed to death after he arrived home about 90 minutes later while Teixeira was still inside, Mr Pappas said.</p>

      <p>With members of the victims' families sitting in the public gallery, the court heard that text messages were sent from Dr Field's mobile phone urging a friend to call 911 because a gunman was in his home.</p>
      <p>A number of 911 calls were attempted from the phone as well.</p>
      <p>Dr Field's friend didn't see the messages immediately, but he eventually raised the alarm with the police and the building's concierge.</p>

      <p>Officers found two packages and a set of keys on the floor in front of the door.</p>
      <p>When they used the keys to open the door, Teixeira emerged and was shot in the leg as one of the officers shouted "gun".</p>
      <p>Teixeira, who worked at the building for several weeks in 2016, was in possession of a duffel bag filled with Dr Bolanos' stolen jewellery and belongings, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Fake guns, knives, pliers, handcuffs, duct tape and a mask - all allegedly belonging to Teixeira - were found in a second bag.</p>

      <p>Dr Bolanos, a Harvard anaesthesia instructor originally from Colombia, was found dead with stab wounds to the neck in one of the bedrooms.</p>
      <p>Dr Field was found dead in a pool of his own blood in a second bedroom.</p>
      <p>Pointing at Teixeira, Mr Pappas told the jury: “These murders were committed by one person acting alone, one person with a purpose and plan.</p>
      <p>“Although the why to this story may never fully be explained to your satisfaction, the who will absolutely never be in doubt.”</p>

      <p>In his opening speech, Steven Sack, defending, told the court that there was no credible or scientific evidence to prove that his client broke into the home.</p>
      <p>Mr Sack said Teixeira was not armed with a gun when he was shot at seven times by police.</p>
      <p>Jurors will visit the murder scene in South Boston during the trial.</p>
      <p>Teixeira, originally from Guinea-Bissau in West Africa, denies first-degree murder, armed robbery, armed home invasion and kidnapping.</p>
      <p>He was formally charged in his hospital room as he recovered from his gunshot injuries.</p>
      <p>The murder suspect avoided deportation a year before the double murder when he struck a plea deal on a bank robbery charge.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
