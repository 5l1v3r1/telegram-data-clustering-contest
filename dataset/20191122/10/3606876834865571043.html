          <b>We met at the Essence Festival</b>
        </p>
        <p>The Bado hit-maker mentioned that since hooking up with the actor, a lot has changed in her life, and she is happy with the direction her love life has taken.</p>
        <p><i>“Rotimi ananizdi busara sana. Ni mtu ambaye ananipa ushauri ambao sijawahi kupwewa na mtu yeyote duniani. Unaeza ukakaa naye ukatafakari maisha yako yote ulikuwa unafanya nini. Nikama ulikuwa unachelewa, unapoteza maisha, unajidhalilisha. Tulikutana Essence festival Juliy kule marekani, ambapo tulitambilswa na rafiki yetu and everything else was instant. Tulikutan ekwenye after party ya spotify and it was so strange kwa sababu sikuwahi hata kutizama power kwa muda japo najua kazi zake vizuri. It was so crazy coz tulitambulishwa alafu akasimama mbele yangu I was like, why is he standing here. So we started talking and we talked for a long time and exchanged numbers. And it was like fresh air. He was to go sit with his fellow actors wa Power but akakuja pande yetu. Ni mtu ambaye kila nikizungumza naye naskia amani ya moyo, furaha, butterflies mpaka kesho, he was so real. It was something very special from the beginning</i>" said Vanessa Mdee.</p>
