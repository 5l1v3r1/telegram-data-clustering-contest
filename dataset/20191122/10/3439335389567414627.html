      <p>A missing opihi picker has been located, and is safe at home after spending the night stranded at the far east end of Maliko Bay, according to the Maui Fire Department.</p>
      <p>Early this morning, at about 1 a.m., Maui firefighters received a call of a missing opihi picker. The caller, a woman, said her friend went to pick opihi in the area at about 4 p.m. Wednesday and never returned.</p>
      <p>Crews made checks in the area as thoroughly and safely as possible in darkness, but surf along the shoreline at the time was large. Rescue crews suspended the search at 3:15 a.m. with plans to resume at first light.</p>
      <p>At about 7 a.m. today, the crew spotted the missing opihi picker, a male Maui resident in his 50s, from aboard the Air 1 helicopter. The man had gotten stranded as large surf pounded the shoreline, and decided to remain in place in a safe location overnight. A firefighter escorted the man up the trail to safety.</p>
      <p>No injuries were reported, and the opihi picker refused any medical attention.</p>
      <p>Last week, the U.S. Coast Guard <a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2019/11/18/breaking-news/coast-guard-suspends-search-for-missing-opihi-picker-off-big-isle/">suspended a search</a> for a missing, 40-year-old man who had been harvesting opihi when a wave swept him offshore of Honokaa on the Big Island.</p>
      <p>He was last seen wearing a red, long-sleeve shirt with camouflage pants and black backpack. Anyone with information is asked to call the Sector Honolulu Command Center at 842-2600.</p>
