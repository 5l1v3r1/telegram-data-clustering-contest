      <p>A Philippine Airlines jet with flames spurting from one engine has returned safely to Los Angeles International Airport shortly after takeoff.</p>
      <p>Ian Gregor of the Federal Aviation Administration says Flight 113, a Boeing 777 bound for Manila, reported a problem with the right engine after takeoff Thursday morning. It turned around and landed at about noon.</p>
      <p>Passengers and people on the ground videotaped blasts of flame coming from the right engine.</p>
      <p>Passenger Walter Baumann tells KABC-TV he heard a series of booms and saw "balls of fire."</p>
      <p>LAX spokesman Heath Montgomery says there was no flame showing from the plane when it landed but firefighters were on hand as a precaution.</p>
      <p>The airline says all 342 passengers and 18 crewmembers are safe.</p>
