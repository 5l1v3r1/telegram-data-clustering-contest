      <p>Earlier this week (November 18), Emily Eavis confirmed that McCartney will headline <a href="http://nme.com/festivals/glastonbury">Glastonbury</a> next year.</p>
      <p>The news came just hours after the <a href="http://nme.com/artists/beatles">Beatles</a> icon seemingly confirmed that he will headline the iconic festival on its 50th anniversary, after sharing a cryptic clue on his Twitter account. Macca shared an image of American composer Philip Glass, actress Emma Stone and rock legend Chuck Berry. When the surnames of all three are combined, the not-so-subtle clue of “Glass-Stone-Bury” was provided.</p>
      <p>Eavis wrote: “IT’S REAL!! So excited.. Having Paul McCartney coming back to headline the Pyramid next year is an absolute dream come true. There really was no one that we wanted more for the 50th anniversary.”</p>
      <p>McCartney later confirmed the news, writing: “Hey Glasto – excited to be part of your Anniversary celebrations. See ya next summer!”</p>
      <p>It ends months of speculation surrounding a headline slot for Macca at Glastonbury’s fiftieth anniversary next year.</p>
      <p>In April, founder Michael Eavis seemingly let slip that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/glastonbury-2020-headliner-rumour-paul-mccartney-2474759">McCartney would be coming to Glastonbury</a>, “Hopefully for the 50th. Don’t make a big thing of it though, will you?” he told the BBC.</p>
      <p>McCartney himself later <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/paul-mccartney-says-glastonbury-2020-remote-possibility-2545078">admitted that a headline slot was a “distinct possibility.”</a></p>
      <p>He went on: “My kids are saying ‘Dad we’ve got to talk about Glastonbury’ and I think I know what they mean,” he told Zoe Ball’s Breakfast Show in September.</p>
