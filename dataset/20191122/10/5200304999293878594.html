      <p>Talking about this new offering, Vishnu Shankar, Business Head, &amp;TV said, “Dr. B.R. Ambedkar laid the foundation of a unified India by bringing millions of Indians under the ambit of one nation and one constitution. His teachings and philosophy still resonate with the Indians across the country, even today. His ability to challenge and mobilize a revolution that redefined the democracy for the Indian soil made him the greatest leader of our times. We are proud to present a show on Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, which is, in fact, a first for the Hindi GEC space. I’m sure his story will inspire and touch the hearts of Indians far and wide.”</p>
