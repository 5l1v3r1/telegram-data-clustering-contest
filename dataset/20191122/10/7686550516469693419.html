      <h2>The manager spoke ahead of his first game against Charlton</h2>

      <p>Cardiff City boss Neil Harris has identified a "superstar" in his squad as he prepares for his first game in charge.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Bluebirds</a> face Charlton at The Valley tomorrow in the Championship early kick-off, and Harris has spent the past few days familiarising himself with his new surroundings.</p>
      <p>He has been out on the training pitch with his new players, running the rule over his squad.</p>
      <p>The new boss has a few stars on the sidelines at present, and he provided a fitness bulletin, while also handing midfielder Joe Ralls a huge compliment in the process.</p>
      <p>He said: "Mozza (Sean Morrison) is looking OK, trained all week, Jazz (Richards) and Armand (Traore) haven't played so aren't there. (Robert) Glatzel has a tight hamstring so we’ll make a decision on that. (Joe) Ralls is a superstar but need to get him fit as well."</p>
      <p>Ralls has been in superb form so far this season, grabbing a hat-trick in the recent 4-2 win over Birmingham City. He will no doubt be a key player under Harris, who also spoke about the difficultly of getting his ideas across in the short amount of time he has been working with the group.</p>
      <p>He added: " There is a small element of knowing the players, I’m aware of players but it’s about judging what I’ve seen. Players who have been at it in training and those who are implementing ideas in training.</p>
      <p>"We have to get the balance right, stopping Charlton and going the other way as well. Some of the players haven’t played a lot. I might mix things up for Tuesday, I like stability."</p>
      <p>The former Millwall boss says one of his first jobs has been to restore confidence at the club after relegation hit over the summer. He said everyone is working towards that goal.</p>
      <p>"The spirit, desire comes with momentum, it’s really positive but it has been a difficult time with stuff behind the scenes," he said.</p>
      <p>"Relegation knocks confidence, we have to try and bring it back together. That’s my first job, making sure everyone is supportive of that.</p>
      <p>"We want friendly rivalries fighting for positions, when you get that then the challenges and shots on goals that football fans want to see, I’m sure that’s what City fans want to see.</p>
      <p>"It’s not about me, it’s about the group."</p>
