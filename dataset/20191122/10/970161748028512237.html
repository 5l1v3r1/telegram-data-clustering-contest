      <p>A prisoner jailed for making death threats against his wife has been given more time behind bars after admitting he’d cut her throat if he met her again.</p>
      <p>Stephen Kennedy, 58, said he would kill his wife if he ever saw her, adding that he would be willing to ‘do life’ for the crime, Teesside Crown Court heard.</p>
      <p>Kennedy was already serving an 18-month sentence, along with a five year restraining order, for making death threats against his former partner.</p>
      <p>When a probation officer came to visit him at Holme House Prison on July 1 to discuss the terms of his release, he was asked how he felt about his wife.</p>
      <p>He replied saying: ‘If I saw her, I would kill her’.</p>
      <p>Kennedy went on to say he wanted ‘revenge’, adding ‘I would do life’ and ‘I would just cut her throat’, prosecutor Paul Newcombe said.</p>

      <p>He said the threats were genuine, he felt angry, and it would not bother him to return to prison.</p>

      <p>When his comments were reported to police, he confessed, adding that his 25-year relationship was over and mentioning a dispute over money.</p>
      <p>The prisoner said he thought his wife would be ‘gobsmacked’ to hear of his comments.</p>
      <p>He had been prescribed medication for mental health and anger problems, but had not been taking them in prison.</p>
      <p>His wife was ‘concerned’ about the threats, the court was told.</p>
      <p>Kennedy was jailed for 20 months after admitting making threats to kill, an offence that carries a maximum of 10 years’ imprisonment.</p>
      <p>A pre-sentence report raised the concern that he might be a dangerous offender, which could have led to an extended sentence.</p>
      <p>Kelleigh Lodge, defending, said his client had been referred to a psychiatrist in prison and was working with the mental health charity Mind.</p>
      <p>He had previously been diagnosed with psychosis and was said to suffer from mild depression.</p>
      <p>Assessments were said to be ‘ongoing’.</p>
      <p>The case had been postponed for three months for the Crown to try to speak to the victim about the effects the death threats had had on her.</p>
      <p>However, inquiries had not led to anything and Judge Deborah Sherwin had decided Kennedy should be allowed to learn his fate for his ‘serious and nasty’ offence.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>She said: ‘He’s been left festering away in prison… Things can’t go on forever.</p>
      <p>‘I have to regard this case as being a case where she’s been caused some distress by the fact that you’ve made further threats to her.</p>
      <p>‘The best mitigation you have is that you pleaded guilty to these matters at the first opportunity.’</p>
