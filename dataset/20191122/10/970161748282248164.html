        <b>It’s déjà vu all over again as we ready ourselves for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/29/boris-johnson-wins-vote-general-election-december-12-11007833/">the third General Election in four years</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Prime Minister <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> previously said he wanted the vote – which is scheduled for 12 December – to take place because there’s a need for a ‘new and revitalised’ Parliament to see <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> through.</p>
      <p>As the election approaches, so too does the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/general-election-2019-register-vote-11124972/">deadline to register to vote</a> in time to cast your ballot.</p>
      <h3>How to register to vote in the upcoming election</h3>
      <p>You’ll need to register to vote if you are a first-time voter or if you have moved house since the last time you voted.</p>
      <p>Registering to vote takes minutes and all you need to do is go to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote">Government’s website.</a></p>
      <p>You must be over 16 to register to vote, but you won’t actually be able to vote until you turn 18. You must also be either a UK citizen or an Irish, Commonwealth or EU citizen with a permanent address in the UK.</p>

      <p>When you register, you’ll be prompted to fill in your National Insurance number – however you can still register without it – as well as where you live, what your nationality is and your date of birth.</p>
      <p>If you <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/can-still-register-vote-general-election-homeless-11188011/">don’t have a fixed address</a>, you can still register if you fill out a form called ‘Declaration of local connection’, which you can also find on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-to-vote-if-you-havent-got-a-fixed-or-permanent-address">government’s website</a>.</p>
      <p>You’ll need to return the form to your electoral registration office which you can find by going to <a href="http://yourvotematters.co.uk/">yourvotematters.co.uk</a>.</p>
