      <p>One of the <a href="http://r.zdbb.net/u/b8fz?or=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.icms.pcmag.com%2Fadmin%2Farticle%2F123706%2F1%2F%3Finline">best deals</a> in the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/advertising-content/118411/amazons-best-uk-deals-before-black-friday">Amazon Black Friday sales</a> this year is the massive discount on the latest Amazon Echo Dot.</p>
      <p>Usually £49.99, the smart device has now dropped to <a href="http://r.zdbb.net/u/b8fz?or=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.icms.pcmag.com%2Fadmin%2Farticle%2F123706%2F1%2F%3Finline">only £22</a>, making this the cheapest the Alexa capable speaker has ever been.</p>
      <p>Before the recent discount, the Echo Dot has been sitting at £34.99 for a reasonable amount of time, but now the Black Friday sales have begun on Amazon, we’re expecting this to be the lowest price you can expect for the next week.</p>
