      <h1>How many children does Caitlyn Jenner have?</h1>
      <h2>Caitlyn's quickly established herself as a firm fan favourite after less than a week in camp, and the star has a large brood waiting for her on the outside</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:08:21+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:08</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> has a fan favourite in <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">Caitlyn Jenner</a> , the hugely famous reality star and former Olympian.</p>
      <p>She's won over audiences, as well as other celebs about camp, with her honesty, down to earth attitude and bravery during the gruelling Bushtucker Trials.</p>
      <p>She's also drawn gushing praise from fans online for her openness as a transgender woman in discussing her 2015 transition.</p>
      <p>The 70 year old is currently dating girlfriend Sophia Hutchins, but has had three marriages prior - and boasts a sizeable brood.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn has a whopping six biological children, four stepchildren and seven grandchildren - with two more on the way.</p>

      <h3>Burt and Cassandra</h3>
      <p>41 year old Burt is Caitlyn's eldest, from her first marriage to Christine Crownover.</p>
      <p>Burt's also dad to William Behr and Bodhi wih girlfriend Valerie Pitalo.</p>
      <p>Cassandra, meanwhile, 39, is now Cassandra Marino, after she tied the knot with Michael Marino.</p>

      <p>They share daughters Isabella and Francesca, and their youngest, son Luke.</p>
      <p>Cassandra tends to keep her private life away from the spotlight, but she's spoken candidly before about her relationship with Caitlyn.</p>
      <p>Back in 2016, the year after Caitlyn transitioned, Cassandra told <a href="https://people.com/tv/caitlyn-jenner-is-a-better-parent-than-bruce-was-says-cassandra-marino/">People</a> : "My relationship with Caitlyn is much better than with Bruce, but we still have a lot of work to do.</p>
      <p>"We didn't see each other for years, and now we see each other every couple of weeks and talk on the phone, which I'm grateful for."</p>
      <p>"She's trying harder," Cassandra continued, "There's a softness to Caitlyn that's new to me."</p>
      <h3>Brandon and Brody</h3>
      <p>Caitlyn's two sons from her second marriage to Linda Thompson have received a stronger dose of the limelight.</p>
      <p>Brandon formed a musical duet with ex-wife Leah, who he divorced last year - they're parents to three year old Eva.</p>

      <p>He's also expecting twins in early 2020 with his girlfriend, Cayley Stoker.</p>
      <p>Brody, meanwhile, has become a reality TV icon, and is currently starring in The Hills reboot.</p>
      <p>It doesn't seem he's that close to Caitlyn, especially after she missed his 2018 wedding to Kaitlynn Carter.</p>
      <p>When asked if he'd be watching I'm A Celeb, a beardy Brody replied: "I don't even know what that is."</p>
      <h3>Kendall and Kylie</h3>
      <p>The most famous of Caitlyn's kids, supermodel Kendall, 24, and cosmetics guru Kylie, 22, never fail to make waves on social media.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn had his youngest two with third wife Kris Jenner, with Kendall carving out a hugely successful modelling career and Kylie becoming the world's youngest self-made billionaire with her eye-wateringly lucrative cosmetics company.</p>
      <p>Kylie's also mum to one year old Stormi Webster, who she shares with rapper and ex Travis Scott.</p>
      <p>Fans have been left raging recently after both Kendall and Kylie failed to share any message of support for Caitlyn during her jungle forays.</p>
      <h3>The Kardashians</h3>

      <p>Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob are Kris' children from her marriage to Robert Kardashain Snr, and Caitlyn's stepchildren.</p>
      <p>The family made a name for themselves with their insanely popular reality bash Keeping Up With The Kardashians, with Caitlyn regularly appearing as Bruce.</p>
      <p>They've added other famous names into the mix as well, with Kim married to rap icon <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> and Khloe previously dating NBA legend Tristan Thompson.</p>

      <p>Rob was also previously in a relationship with Blac Chyna who, incidentally, also dated Kylie Jenner's ex Tyga.</p>
      <p>The Kardashians' list of children is lenghty - Kim and Kanye share North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm, Kourtney and her ex Scott Disick have Mason, Penelope and Reign, Khloe has True with ex Tristan, and Rob and Blac Chyna have Dream.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn, meanwhile, is going strong with Sophia.</p>
      <p>She said of her belle, who is also a transgender woman: "We're partners in everything we do. We're inseperable.</p>
      <p>"We're business partners, we live together, we share a dog, we share family, we share a life together."</p>
