      <h1>iPhone 12 Pro and Max predicted to have 6GB of RAM</h1>

      <p>Having recently traveled to Asia and talked to Apple’s suppliers, Barclays analysts have concluded Apple will outfit next year’s iPhone 12 Pro and Max smartphones with six gigabytes of RAM, up from four gigabytes of RAM in the current iPhone 11 Pro and Max models.</p>
      <p>The base model iPhone 12 is expected to have 4GB of RAM, just like the current iPhone 11.</p>
      <p>There’s got to be a very good reason behind the supposed decision to boost the RAM because we know adding more RAM to a smartphone taxes the battery. If I had to make an educated guess, I’d say the next iPhone will either bring one or more additional lenses to the camera system or feature improved augmented reality capability via the rear camera (or both).</p>
      <p>Either way, additional RAM may be needed for just those enhancements. Remember, if you will, that the iPhone 7 Plus had 3GB of RAM (more than any previous model) versus 2GB of RAM for the regular iPhone 7 because the former featured a dual-lens imaging system that required more RAM for photo processing than a single camera system on the iPhone 7.</p>
      <p>Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis and his associates alluded to something like that in their research note,. obtained by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/22/barclays-iphone-12-pro-likely-6gb-ram/">MacRumors</a>, writing that both iPhone 12 Pro and Max models should be outfitted with rear 3D sensing cameras and mmWave support for 5G networking.</p>
      <p>“While the iPhone 12 is also expected to be 5G-enabled, the analysts did not indicate whether the device will support mmWave, sub-6GHz or both,” notes MacRumors.</p>
      <p>As for the rumored “iPhone SE 2” or whatever Apple ends up calling it, the analysts believe mass production will kick off in February 2020, in time for a Spring 2019 release.</p>
      <p>Corroborating previous reports, Curtis &amp; Co. are expecting a phone resembling the iPhone 8 form factor complete with a 4.7-inch display and a Touch ID-enabled Home button. The iPhone SE 2 should be powered by Apple’s latest A13 Bionic chip and feature three gigabytes of RAM.</p>
      <p>Provided such a product is in the works, would you be interested in the next iPhone SE?</p>
