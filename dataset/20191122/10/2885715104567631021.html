      <p>The pink-ball Test between India and Bangladesh in Kolkata has expectedly generated a lot of hype, and BCCI president <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sourav-ganguly/">Sourav Ganguly</a> had said last week that tickets for the first 3 days were sold out.</p>
      <p>However, black marketeers had a field day Friday before the highly-anticipated game began. People were seen gathering near the Maidan area near Mohammadan Sporting Club to buy tickets at exorbitant prices.</p>
      <p>“Tickets for Rs 50 are being sold for as much Rs 2000, while Rs 100 tickets are being sold for Rs. 5000. Nobody wants to miss out on the fun. I bought two 50 rupees tickets for my mother and myself,” said Vaibhav Shah, a working professional.</p>
      <p>The illegal sale of tickets was being conducted in full view despite the presence of plenty of police personnel in the area.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, a number of middle-aged women were among those spotted selling the tickets. When this reporter spoke to a Kolkata Police constable,  who was standing metres away from a person selling the tickets, he said that no action can be taken as the area fell under the purview of Maidan police station.</p>
      <p>“We can’t really do much about it. If somebody wants to file a complaint then they have to make it at Maidan police station and then they will send a patrol to pick up those guilty. We can’t do much about it,” said the constable, who did not wish to be named.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Kolkata Police officials arrested six persons during a drive against black marketing of tickets around Eden Gardens. The arrests were made by the anti-rowdy section of the city police’s Detective Department. A day earlier, six persons were arrested and 38 tickets for the match were seized by the police.</p>
