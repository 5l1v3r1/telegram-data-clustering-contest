      <h1>Chuck D Says Shows Like ‘Maury’ and ‘The Jerry Springer Show’ Get Paid By the Government to Make Black Folks Look Bad</h1>

      <p><a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/tag/chuck-d/"><b>Chuck D</b></a> blasted shows like “The Jerry Springer Show” and “Maury” for their content. And he believes the federal government helps them make Black folks look bad.</p>
      <p>The Public Enemy frontman took to Twitter on Tuesday and said the shows’ respective hosts Maury Povich and Jerry Springer must be getting money from the feds.</p>

      <p>“Just how much the fed$ pay these old white dudes like Maury &amp; Jerry showtiming young folks dysfunctional sht on Air …especially young blacks,” tweeted Chuck. “Beware of elder media Nucointelpro buzzards hovering. Everything ain’t entertainment in fact it’s exploitation.”</p>
      <p>Starting as “The Maury Povich Show” in 1991, it used to cover some of the day’s topics and had a serious tone. That was until 1998 when Studios USA, which is now NBCUniversal, began producing it and changed the format entirely.</p>
      <p>From there, “Maury,” which is still on today, took on a tabloid feel and aired a lot of dysfunction, particularly among young black people. And its most popular segment involves paternity tests after women say they aren’t sure who fathered their child.</p>
      <p>And just like “Maury,” “The Jerry Springer Show,” which also began in 1991, started off discussing serious topics like politics and social issues, much like “The Phil Donahue Show.”</p>
      <p>But this show also didn’t take long to transform, and in the following seasons the show became famous for televising family dysfunction, and people seemingly tuned in to watch the many fights that took place each episode.</p>
      <p>“The Jerry Springer Show” ended in July of last year, and now Springer is on a syndicated courtroom series called “Judge Jerry.”</p>
      <p>After Chuck’s tweet made the internet rounds, people shared their opinions on it.</p>
      <p>“Thank you for saying this, truth being spoken right here. It’s sad,” one person tweeted.</p>
      <p>“TOTAL AGREE CHUCK,” wrote someone else. “My only add: no one’s forcing guests against their will to come on the air and act a certain way. They are ALL paid to play this act out…I’ve always found MURRAY-JERRY disgusting shows…no place in my life for it.”</p>
      <p>“It breaks my heart that we go on those shows in the first place,” another person followed. “There is no payment, at least on ‘Maury.’ They get the trip, hotel and a small per diem for meals, incidentals.”</p>
      <p>In the comment section of his tweet, Chuck offered other opinions on certain talk shows and wrote, “It’s like young folks make mistakes as human beings… so what …? they are figuring life out but OLD People execs wanna keep doing TV $hows on them SMdH . #exploitation.”</p>
