      <h1>Elon Musk launches weird Tesla truck, celebrates by smashing windows</h1>
      <h2>He's been at the podcasts again</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:35:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theinquirer.net/author/profile/2960/chris-merriman" target="_blank">Chris Merriman</a></address>
      <p><b>ELON MUSK</b> has shown once again that he's incapable of doing anything without a <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3065289/elon-musk-claims-tesla-420-tweet-was-worth-it-despite-usd20m-sec-fine">hint of drama</a> to it.</p>
      <p>The charismatic Gonzo impersonator took to the stage last night to show off the latest line from his Tesla electric vehicle company - the Cybertruck - and once people were over the shock of the design, they got to see a classic Musk flourish.</p>
      <p>During a demonstration by Tesla's head of design, Franz von Holzhausen of how difficult it was to break the windows (using a metal ball), the windows actually broke. Clearly, nobody had explained to him that even toughened glass is a bit rubbish.</p>
      <p>Musk responded with a swear before muttering "room for improvement" to a smattering of laughter. Musk added that they'd completely failed to break the windows in every test thus far. The curse of the on-stage tech demo strikes again.</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck is a pick-up truck, a cornerstone of motoring in the US, but looks more like an etch-a-sketch drawing of the Delorian from <i>Back To The Future</i>. In fact, it simultaneously manages to look like a dystopian nightmare and achingly cool at the same time (after all, it is a Tesla).</p>
      <p>The other boast for the Cybertruck is less tangible. It's been released now because it has become possible; Tesla batteries are getting better and better, meaning you can get a decent range, even with a heavy load. The base model (£31k) can go 250m on a charge, or for £51.3k, you can 500 miles - that's based on a load of 3500lb.</p>
      <p>Although pre-orders have started now, production isn't due to start until late 2021, and given <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3030277/elon-musk-admits-too-much-automation-is-slowing-tesla-model-3-production">Tesla's "creative" approach to deadlines</a>, even not that's set in stone - expect to be well into 2022 at the earliest before you see one of these bad boys on the road.</p>
      <p>Apart from anything else, they still need to fix those windows. μ</p>
