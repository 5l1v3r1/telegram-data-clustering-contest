      <h3>Bureau of Immigration (BI) personnel have been placed on heightened alert as it braces itself for the upcoming Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games) and the holiday rush.</h3>
      <p>The BI said it is expecting up to three percent increase in arrivals and departures this holiday season.</p>

      <p>BI records show that in December 2018 alone, more than 1.5M passengers arrived in the country, while more than 1.2M departed.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, BI Port Operations Division Chief Grifton Medina shared that they are again enforcing the ‘No Leave, No Absences’ policy during the SEA Games and holiday rush.</p>

      <p>Medina likewise reminded travelers to “arrive early, at least three hours before your flight,” and appealed to travelers to bear with build ups.</p>
