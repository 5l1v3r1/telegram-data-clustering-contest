      <p>Dutch marine company Boskalis has secured new contracts worth $120million for heavy marine transport services.</p>
      <p>Boskalis announced that execution of majority of projects is scheduled to take place in 2021 and 2022.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Boskalis said following last year’s transportation of a sizable box-shaped FPSO, they had secured a contract to transport a similar FPSO from China to Brazil.</p>
      <p>“With a weight exceeding 91,000 tons, this marks another record-breaking transport for the BOKA Vanguard, which is scheduled to commence at the end of 2019.”</p>
      <p>Boskalis also secured a contract for the transportation of various large LNG modules from a fabrication yard in China to Russia. The contract ties up the two high-end open-stern heavy transport vessels Blue Marlin and Black Marlin commencing Q2 2021.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Boskalis was awarded the contract for the transportation of an FPSO from the fabrication yard in China to the North Sea in 2021 and the transportation of two Floating Production Systems from Singapore to the Gulf of Mexico in the period 2021-2022. These cargoes will be transported on the White Marlin and Blue Marlin.</p>
      <p>These contracts were signed in the third and fourth quarter of 2019. Approximately 50% of the combined contract value was awarded in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>In East Africa Boskalis is currently involved in dredging work at Mombasa Port Development Project II (berth 22) which commenced on February 17, 2019, using Trailing Suction Hopper dredger christened Willem Van Orange.</p>
      <p>This particular dredger vessel according to Kenya Ports Authority spokesperson Bernard Osero is dredging up to 15 metres below chart datum.</p>
      <p>The activities at the Mombasa Port is part of a  Master Plan which promises to revolutionise the shipping and logistics sector in the country.</p>
      <p>Through the plan, KPA is seeking to make Kenya not only a trade and logistics hub in the region, but also a major player in global commerce through terminal expansion and leveraging on the existing infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Boskalis has an office in Nairobi which covers the East Africa region.</p>
      <p>On 1 August 2012, Boskalis signed a sub-contract for the dredging and reclamation works for the first construction phase for the second container terminal in Mombasa.</p>
