      <p>Graham Norton will take over from Joanna Lumley as host of the film Baftas.</p>
      <p>The chat show host, 56, has made his mark presenting the TV Baftas several times in the last 15 years.</p>
      <p>But the comedian will now host the film ceremony for the first time.</p>
      <p>He takes over from Lumley, who fronted the show for two years, and her predecessor Stephen Fry.</p>

      <p>Lumley drew mixed reviews from viewers at this year’s ceremony and some criticism for a quip about the Ku Klux Klan while referring to the film BlacKkKlansman.</p>
      <p>The overnight TV audience dropped by half a million viewers.</p>
      <p>Norton said: “I’m delighted to be taking the helm of the biggest night in British film, the audience at the Royal Albert Hall will be the biggest sofa I’ve ever faced.</p>
      <p>“I’m honoured to be following in the fabulous footsteps of Stephen Fry and Joanna Lumley.”</p>

      <p>Bafta chief executive Amanda Berry said Norton “will bring his brilliance and unique brand of humour to the role”.</p>
      <p>She added: “The film awards is transmitted around the world, and those audiences know him too.</p>
      <p>“With Graham as our host I have no doubt we will deliver a very special celebration of the very best in film, and pay tribute to the most talented and creative people both in front of and behind the camera.”</p>
      <p>Controller of BBC entertainment Kate Phillips said: “Graham’s wit and charisma has made him one of the UK’s most successful television show hosts and I could not think of a better person to pick up the baton from the absolutely fabulous Joanna Lumley.”</p>
      <p>Nominations for the EE British Academy Film Awards will be revealed in January.</p>
      <p>
        <i>The ceremony will be held at the Royal Albert Hall on Sunday February 2, with a performance from Cirque du Soleil, and broadcast on BBC One. </i>
