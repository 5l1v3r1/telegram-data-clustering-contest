      <h1>More support agreed to help survivors of sexual abuse in Nottinghamshire</h1>
      <h2>But a report has also said support is 'inequitable' across the county</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:19:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:19</time> by <a rel="author">David Whitfield</a></address>
      <p>More money has been agreed to help support people in Nottinghamshire who have been sexually abused or are the victims of sexual violence.</p>
      <p>The existing support services will be funded until at least June 2022, and there will also be a new full-time mental health nurse funded by the NHS.</p>
      <p>It comes after a 163-page report from sexual violence specialist organisation LimeCulture identified what improvements were needed to help survivors locally.</p>
      <p>And it's set against the wider background of the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/child-abuse-inquiry">child sexual abuse scandal</a> which saw hundreds of children abused in council care from the the 1950s onwards.</p>
      <p>LimeCulture, which works with groups across the country, has published the findings of its 'Needs Assessment for Sexual Violence and Abuse Survivors in Nottinghamshire'.</p>
      <p>The research was commissioned by Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner Paddy Tipping, NHS England and NHS Improvement Midlands to identifying the needs of sexual violence and abuse survivors, the support services required, and the likely demand in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire.</p>

      <p>It said that, while there had been a "concerted effort" by authorities locally to "work together to improve the response to sexual violence across Nottinghamshire", the number of different services available across the county was "inequitable and may result in varying quality of provision."</p>
      <p>One of the report's 26 recommendations is to look at whether there should be a single 'hub' which would co-ordinate assessments and referrals for survivors.</p>
      <p>Responding to the findings of the research, Mr Tipping said: "I welcome the detailed recommendations from this review.</p>
      <p>"More than 50 individual victims and survivors of sexual violence contributed their views to this survey, which was one of the largest of its kind in Nottinghamshire. Their experiences and views will have a direct impact on the future design and funding of support services across Nottinghamshire and I am delighted so many were willing to get involved.</p>
      <p>"Clearly, the project highlighted areas where provision must improve. The need for a single 'co-ordinated hub' was identified, allowing survivors to access a broad spectrum of support services in one place, as well as enhanced care to address the complex mental health needs of victims and survivors of sexual violence.</p>
      <p>"We have already undertaken some preliminary work, consulting with survivors on what a hub might look like and our partners on how it might be funded. I’ve also met with public sector funders including clinical commissioning groups to map out our next steps."</p>

      <p>He added: "The result of these discussions has been very positive, with the City and County Council and I agreeing to continue funding for the Survivor Support Service until June 2022 and the SV Engagement Manager until March 2021.</p>
      <p>"Our colleagues need time to consider the full implications of this research and how they will respond. A progress meeting is planned for next month and I hope we will soon be in a position to fund and commission a new model of support that better reflects the needs of all survivors of sexual violence and abuse in Nottinghamshire.</p>
      <p>"As part of these arrangements, we have been awarded new funding from NHS England/Improvement to deliver a new full-time mental health nurse within our specialist Sexual Violence and Abuse (SVA) services and additional specialist SVA counselling.</p>
      <p>"My priority as Nottinghamshire’s Police and Crime Commissioner is to protect the interests of all victims and ensure they receive the very best services to support their recovery in the future. Lessons have been learned and we are very firmly focused on the future."</p>
      <p>A report in the summer from the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/child-abuse-inquiry">Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse</a> (IICSA) into historical abuse in residential and foster care across Nottinghamshire found that both the city and county councils failed to stop what was taking place despite "decades of evidence".</p>
      <p>Both councils were told to come up with an action plan to address existing concerns, and both have now done this.</p>
      <p>Roz Lindridge, Director of Specialised Commissioning and Health and Justice for NHS England and NHS Improvement in the Midlands, said: "The physical and emotional impact of sexual crimes lasts a lifetime, so it’s important that survivors can get the help they need, whenever they need it.</p>
      <p>"We’re committed to working with Nottinghamshire survivors and the county’s police and crime commissioner to ensure that the right care is available to meet everyone’s needs.”</p>

      <p>David Hollas of the Nottinghamshire Child Sexual Abuse Survivors Group added: "I have made the point to survivors, and to others, the work and hard graft of the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner should not be underestimated in delivering not only a CSA survivor support pathway, but also the broader support response to all victims of sexual violence.</p>
      <p>“We have seen a significant investment from the Police and Crime Commissioner, not only determined by amount but also co-ordinating the response from partners and building confidence and trust with survivors in those services.”</p>
