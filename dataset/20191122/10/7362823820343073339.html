      <h1>Humble One: Mourinho says he’s emotionally stronger at Spurs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:30:46+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:30</time> by <a rel="author">Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>After touting his humility and willingness to learn from past mistakes, Jose Mourinho couldn’t resist a flash of the old familiar cheekiness.</p>
      <p>Even after opening his first comments as Tottenham manager by praising his predecessor Mauricio Pochettino, Mourinho couldn’t resist a one-liner that reminded everyone — however unintentionally — that Tottenham had replaced a coach who never landed a title with a serial trophy winner.</p>
      <p>It came when he was asked how much of Spurs’ current struggles in the Premier League was a result of the disappointment of the Champions League loss to Liverpool in the final in June?</p>
      <p>“I don't know,” Mourinho flashed back, “because I never lost a Champions League final.”</p>
      <p>He has, however, won two of them. With Inter Milan in 2010 and Porto in 2004 — the signature success that set Mourinho on the path to managerial superstardom, sprinkled with a heavy dose of feuds and divisive bravado.</p>
      <p>It’s 15 years since Mourinho first arrived in England at Chelsea, calling himself a “Special One” in a swaggering introduction.</p>
      <p>The message Mourinho tried to portray at his Tottenham presentation on Thursday was that he is meeker now.</p>
      <p>“I'm humble enough to try to analyze what I did in my career,” Mourinho said. “The evolution, the problems, the solutions.</p>
      <p>“The principle of the analysis was not to blame anyone else.”</p>
      <p>Asked if he was no longer as brash, Mourinho responded: “I was always humble but you didn’t understand that.”</p>
      <p>This was a more introspective Mourinho, reprising the charm seen at Chelsea (twice), Real Madrid and Manchester United before he grew irritated with the club and too often his own players.</p>
      <p>“I'm stronger,” Mourinho said. “When I say I’m stronger … from the emotional point of view. I’m relaxed. I’m motivated. I’m ready. I think the players felt that in two days.”</p>
      <p>By the time he was fired by Manchester United in December 2018, it became clear Mourinho’s relationship with the players had fractured.</p>
      <p>Being out of work gave Mourinho time to contemplate on his own style.</p>
      <p>“You never lose your DNA. You never lose your identity,” he said. “I had time to think about many things. Don’t ask me what are the mistakes. But I realize during my career I made mistakes but I won’t make the same mistakes. I'm going to make new mistakes.”</p>
      <p>It is the first time Mourinho has been hired by a team in mid-season since 2002 when he was hired by Porto.</p>
      <p>Mourinho’s first game is a London derby at West Ham on Saturday, with Tottenham 11 points from the four Champions League places.</p>
      <p>What Mourinho won’t get necessarily at Tottenham is the type of lavish spending he enjoyed at Chelsea and Madrid.</p>
      <p>“I don't need (new) players, I'm so happy with the players I have,” Mourinho said. “I just need time to understand them better, to know everything about them because I always say you only know a player when you work with them.</p>
      <p>“Of course, how many times I watched these guys, how many times I played (managed) against them. I know them well but you never know them well enough until you work with them. And my gift is this squad, the squad is very, very good.”</p>
      <p>Just one that has never won titles. The club’s last trophy came through the 2008 League Cup and the championship hasn’t been won since 1961.</p>
      <p>“We can’t win the Premier League this season,” Mourinho said. “We can ... next season.”</p>
