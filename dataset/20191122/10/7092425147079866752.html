      <p>A black cat found wandering the streets by the Santa Fe Animal Shelter has been reunited with his owner after five years.</p>
      <p>Sasha the cat somehow ended up 1,200 miles from his Portland home in Oregon and was spotted on the streets of Santa Fe in New Mexico.</p>
      <p>It remains unknown just how the cat ended up so far away from home. Only Sasha knows these details but miraculously, staff from the Santa Fe Animal Shelter scanned his microchip and discovered 31-year-old Viktor Usov was the pet's owner.</p>

      <p>Mr Usov, a medical student, could not believe the news when he was contacted. He had thought the worst had happened.</p>
      <p>On wondering where his beloved pet ventured to, Mr Usov said to KGW:</p>
      <p>“He went on a grand American adventure.</p>
      <p>“He stopped by the Grand Canyon, Crater Lake, he saw the monuments, all the national parks, definitely Redwood Forest.”</p>
      <p>Thanks to American Airlines, the cat was flown, along with a member of staff from Santa Fe Animal Shelter to Portland where human was reunited with animal.</p>

      <p>A spokesperson for American Airlines told CNN:</p>
      <p>"When we heard Sasha had been found so far from home, after so many years away from his family, we were honoured to be in a position to get him back.</p>
      <p>"We're glad to have provided a happy ending to Sasha's long journey."</p>
      <p>Usov is simply ecstatic to have his cat back after a long time of wondering about the animal's welfare.</p>
      <p>Now that they are reunited, he plans to make the most of the reunion.</p>
      <p>"I'm going to take him home and love on him," he said.</p>
      <p>"What else do you do with a fluffy cat? You love on him. I am so excited."</p>
