      <h1>Sources: Resident Evil 3 remake in development</h1>
      <h2>Dead excited.</h2>

      <p>Capcom will follow its successful Resident Evil 2 remake with a new version of Resident Evil 3, a report today suggests.</p>
      <p>This comes from YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksBrLDX8SCM">SpawnWave</a>, who said it was on track for a 2020 launch.</p>
      <p>Eurogamer has heard of the project also. Sources close to its development suggest it has been in development for some time - although the franchise's upcoming multiplayer portion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-12-project-resistance-is-an-asymmetric-resident-evil-spin-off-in-which-you-can-play-as-mr-x">Project Resistance is currently being given the spotlight</a>.</p>

      <p>Development on the game has been hinted at, more or less, by Capcom itself in the past - the developer <a href="http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/annual/2019/annual_2019_01.pdf">suggested more remakes</a> of its classic back catalogue would follow if Resident Evil 2 sold well.</p>
      <p>And considering the positive fan response to the brilliantly creepy Resi 2 redo, the fact Resi 3 is in development should be of little surprise. Its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-03-06-how-the-resident-evil-2-remakes-mr-x-actually-works">terrifying Mr. X</a> was a standout - and the modding scene went to town <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-02-21-resident-evil-2-mod-strips-mr-x-down-to-an-umbrella-thong">putting him in a thong</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-03-03-this-mod-turns-resident-evil-2s-mr-x-into-thomas-the-tank-engine">turning him into Thomas the Tank Engine</a></p>
      <p>While we wait, this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-07-13-this-impressive-resident-evil-3-hd-texture-pack-helps-with-the-wait-for-capcoms-inevitable-remake">impressive Resident Evil 3 HD texture pack</a> gives us a glimpse at what it all might look like.</p>
      <p>Capcom declined to comment when contacted by Eurogamer.</p>
