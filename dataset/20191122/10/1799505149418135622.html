      <h1>Quid Pro Goats</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:55:51+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.courthousenews.com/author/bob-kahn/" target="_blank">ROBERT KAHN</a></address>
      <p>Oh, those festive evenings long ago when little donnie and I settled down in the barn with the goats who loved us.</p>
      <p>Losers, liberals and Democrats might say it was a forced and uncomfortable love, greased by tranquilizers, and if necessary, temporary immobilization by electrical devices.</p>

      <p>But hey, that’s how don john rolls.</p>
      <p>Or may soon.</p>
      <p>Every evening when we entered the barn, the goats rose up on their pretty little hooves, braying, “Baab’s here.”</p>
      <p>Little donnie paid off the guards and the evening went as planned.</p>
      <p>Nothing you don’t know already.</p>
      <p>Little donnie still owes me $13,399.99 for medicaments and salve, by the way — a debt I have refrained from mentioning during our <i>Anschluss</i>, hoping he might pay me back one day.</p>
      <p>He offered me 30% and quits, which worked for him before, but not with this tough <i>hombre.</i></p>
      <p>I know now that I was foolish. Little donnie doesn’t pay his debts even under court order.</p>
      <p>Sure, that $1,339.99 could have saved Little Debbie’s life, but who is Little Debbie anyway?</p>
      <p>I mean, who was she? Some girl? A Democrat? Who cares?</p>
      <p>What’s important is that little donnie told me about goats, and their many uses, for which I will be forever grateful.</p>
      <p>Even if the goats aren’t.</p>
      <p>
        <i>(Pause for commercial break.)</i>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>I have just implied that the president of the United States instructed me, and joined in having sexual intercourse with goats. And that I paid for his medical treatment for it, and he stiffed me for the bill.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>So?</p>
      <p>Can he prove he did not do it?</p>
      <p>And how is this fantastical story different from what played out before the world this week, live on TV, in the impeachment hearings?</p>
      <p>This is how little donnie got elected, and governs: giving people demeaning nicknames, lying about them, about himself, about scientists — about science itself — lying about religion, nature, poor people, rich people, Russia, racism, justice, mammals — about where he put his hands, when, where and to whom.</p>
      <p>Not why. We all know why.</p>
      <p>And what he did next.</p>
      <p>And who paid for it.</p>
      <p>That’s how little donnie has carried on ever since, as he goose-steps around the White House, elbows out. This is how he governs us — you, me, the goats and his sheep — and will continue to govern us until he is thrown out of office, by hook or shepherd’s crook.</p>
      <p>Donald john Trump is the apotheosis of smarm, money-grubbing and ignorance.</p>
      <p>Did he ever have sexual intercourse with goats?</p>
      <p>Did he ever get a hoof job from anyone but Satan?</p>
      <p>I don’t know. It could have happened — if you believe in Satan. But we’ll never know, will we?</p>
      <p>Why, then, do I bring it up?</p>
      <p>Because that’s the “defense” his Republican congressmen and senators are throwing up for him. I mean “throwing up” literally.</p>
      <p>We have 525 representatives in Congress. And this is … what? Aside from weakness. Weakness before the power of Valdimir Putin, Recep Tayyip Ordogan, Viktor Orban, and the rest of the remnants of Fascism.</p>
      <p>I resort to metaphorical goats because that’s how little donnie got elected, and how he governs us: throwing vile, unsubstantiated, criminal allegations against anyone who opposes him, about anything.</p>
      <p>It’s what Trump’s “national security adviser” John Bolton — good heavens — did with as much gusto as his boss. Bolton has said that Vladimir Putin’s interference in our presidential election did not come from Russia at all: It was a “false flag” operation, carried out by — wait for it — not Ukraine, but by President Obama and Hillary Clinton.</p>
      <p>My goodness.</p>
      <p>And now decent, presumably self-respecting Americans pretend to believe and hope that Bolton will say anything useful in the impeachment inquiry?</p>
      <p>O, please.</p>
      <p>Here’s what’s clear, so far, in the Republican Theme Park Impeachment Show (health insurance optional): All of us may be traitors.</p>
      <p>Just by living our lives as we’ve always lived them.</p>
      <p>Traitors to what? Or to whom?</p>
      <p>And can you be a traitor by being unfaithful to a what? Or a whom? To a man elected to a temporary office, no matter how high?</p>
      <p>Answer me one question, my fellow Americans: Can you prove you are not a traitor?</p>
      <p>How will you prove it?</p>
      <p>
