      <p>French telecom authority Arcep has released the procedure setting out the rules for the forthcoming 5G auction of 3.4-3.8 GHz spectrum. The document confirms the main principles laid out in the <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/france-announces-rules-for-5g-spectrum-auction--1300913">draft published in mid-July</a>, while containing several adjustments taking into account feedback from operators and the view of the government.</p>
      <p>The main change from the initial draft is the decision to increase the chunk of spectrum awarded at a fixed price in the first phase of the auction. The size of this block has risen to 50 MHz per operator, from the initial proposal of at least 40 MHz. This move <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/bouygues-successfully-lobbies-for-5g-spectrum-auction-change-report--1314721">was prompted by reactions</a> during the consultation period, as revealed by the press earlier this month. The government has opted for four blocks of 50 MHz, although Arcep had recommended setting the size at 60 MHz.</p>
      <p>The coverage obligations laid out in the draft decision have been confirmed. In line with Arcep's initial proposals, the four network operators will also need to adhere to a new mechanism enabling industry verticals to receive connectivity from operators under "reasonable conditions". If appropriate, these services will be provided on a customised basis to meet coverage and performance needs. Alternatively, operators will have the choice to assign frequencies locally.</p>
      <p>Among the more specific obligations, licence holders will need to be capable of delivering commercial offers with differentiated services. To this end, innovative network architectures, such as slicing will have to be activated by 2023 at the latest. Additionally, compatibility with the IPv6 protocol will be compulsory from the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>The next step in the auction process is for the government to set all the necessary financial conditions. According to unconfirmed press reports, several decisions are still pending, including what the spectrum floor price should be set at. Once this price is made known, operators will have a legal time limit of eight weeks to prepare for the auction. As a result, they <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/france-to-delay-5g-spectrum-auction-until-march-2020-report--1316769">could have to wait until March 2020</a> for the bidding process to begin.Â </p>
