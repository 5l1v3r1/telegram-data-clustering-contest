      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-gallagher/">James Gallagher</a> has confirmed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/conor-mcgregor/">Conor McGregor</a> is back in training for his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ufc/">UFC</a> return and backed his SBG team-mate to return to his best.</p>
      <p>McGregor <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/24/conor-mcgregor-announces-ufc-return-january-nate-diaz-trilogy-fight-2020-10975380/">announced last month he would fight in January</a>, with UFC lightweights Donald Cerrone and Justin Gaethje leading the race to welcome the Irishman back to the octagon.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bellator/">Bellator</a> star Gallagher, 23, has trained alongside McGregor since he was a teenager and explained why the gym had been closed to non-members during the day.</p>
      <p>Head coach John Kavanagh announced the decision last week, leading to speculation McGregor was officially back in camp.</p>
      <p>‘We’ve had real issues with bus loads of people coming into the gym when we’re training,’ Gallagher explained to <i><b>Metro.co.uk</b>.</i></p>

      <p>‘That’s the reason. You can’t have people wandering in when you’re on the mat and asking for a picture.</p>

      <p>‘Now if you’re asking me is Conor back training, yes he is. It doesn’t matter if he’s there or not, people are coming in every day.</p>
      <p>‘We had one bus full of Asian tourists pull up. About 50 of them! All over the gym and taking pictures. It’s become a tourist attraction and we can’t have that as fighters.’</p>
      <p>McGregor has not fought at all in 2019, with his last bout in October 2018 when he lost to lightweight champion and bitter rival Khabib Nurmagomedov.</p>
      <p>UFC president <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/31/dana-white-reveals-donald-cerrone-frontrunner-fight-conor-mcgregor-ufc-return-11018044/">Dana White has refused to be drawn into speculation about McGregor’s official comeback</a>, but the former featherweight and lightweight champion’s manager confirmed talks were ongoing about a January return.</p>

      <p>McGregor has not fought regularly in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mma/">MMA</a> since 2016, fighting just once since defeating Eddie Alvarez to become two-weight champion in November of that year.</p>
      <p>But Gallagher has no concerns about McGregor’s insistence he will avenge his loss to Nurmagomedov and believes his team-mate can rediscover his best form.</p>
      <p>‘Of course he can get back to his best, and better,’ Gallagher insisted.</p>
      <p>‘He can do anything he wants to do when he puts his mind to it. There’s no limits with him. You only limit yourself.’</p>
