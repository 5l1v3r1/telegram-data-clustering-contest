      <p>The City of Kelowna says it is concerned for the safety of those living in tents along Leon Avenue as we head into the winter season.</p>
      <p>“Our primary concern with the current use of tents for overnight sheltering is safety related,” says Kelowna Fire Chief Travis Whiting. “Specifically, the close grouping of the tents with highly combustible materials around, and the observed use of unsafe heaters create a fire or carbon monoxide risk to the residents.”</p>
      <p>As the number of homeless on Leon continues to grow, the city says it is monitoring the situation and working to find solutions.<br/> <br/>“We know we need more shelter space in the city, and we must respect the legal rights of people to shelter outdoors when there is no room in the existing shelters,” says Darren Caul, community safety director.    <br/> <br/>So far, there has been no movement despite the efforts of provincial officials, the Journey Home Society and the city to find temporary winter shelter space. "Locating space has proved challenging," says Sue Wheeler, the city's social development manager.<br/> <br/>“Tents are not a solution to homelessness – housing with supports is the solution. While we have more than 100 units of housing scheduled to open in the spring, we are continuing to work with the province, our community partners and those with lived experience to try and secure supports and an adequate number of overnight shelter beds to accommodate people currently sleeping outside.”<br/> <br/>B.C. law specifies that where there is insufficient housing and shelter space for people experiencing homelessness, a municipality cannot prohibit all parks and public spaces from being used for temporary overnight shelter. Municipalities must identify public space where they will not prohibit overnight outdoor sheltering on public lands, which to date has been Leon Avenue in Kelowna.<br/> <br/>The city is paying attention to the experiences of other communities and the serious safety hazards associated with fires and propane explosions.<br/> <br/>“Our main focus is to continue to work with our partners to find and create more shelter and supportive living spaces with BC Housing and the Journey Home Society,” said Caul. “In the meantime, we’re all trying to keep people safe and maintain order in what is a not a good situation for anyone involved, including businesses.”</p>
