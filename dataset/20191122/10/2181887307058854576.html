      <h1>Xerox threatens hostile bid following HP's takeover offer rejection</h1>
      <h2>CEO says he's 'confused' by PC maker's reasoning</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:22:38+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theinquirer.net/author/profile/2353/carly-page" target="_blank">Carly Page</a></address>
      <p><b>COPIER MAKER</b> Xerox has urged HP to reconsider its $33.5bn takeover bid, threatening that it will otherwise go hostile and make its pitch directly to shareholders.</p>
      <p>In a letter to HP's board of directors, Xerox CEO John Visentin said that he was "very surprised" by <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3083838/hp-rejects-xerox-takeover-bid">the company's unanimous rejection of its initial takeover offer</a>, which HP claimed "significantly undervalued" the company. </p>
      <p>"We are open to exploring whether there is value to be created for HP shareholders through a potential combination with Xerox," HP said in a statement last week."However, as we have previously shared in connection with our prior requests for diligence, we have fundamental questions that need to be addressed in our diligence of Xerox."</p>
      <p>Visentin stated that the Xerox board has accepted HP<b>'</b>s request for due diligence and added that the firm is keen to take "the proposed acquisition of HP to completion". He gave the PC maker a 25 November deadline to reconsider its decision. </p>
      <p>"Unless you and we agree on mutual confirmatory due diligence to support a friendly combination by 5:00 p.m. EST on Monday, November 25, 2019, Xerox will take its compelling case to create superior value for our respective shareholders directly to your shareholders," <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191121005537/en/Xerox-Issues-Letter-HP">Xerox wrote in its letter</a>.</p>
      <p>He also rejected HP's claims that a takeover was not in the best interest of HP shareholders, noting that the acqusition bid represents a 29 per cent premium over HP's 30-day average trading price.</p>
      <p>"We are confused by this reasoning in that your own financial adviser, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co, set a $14 price target with a <b>'</b>sell<b>'</b> rating for HP<b>'</b>s stock after you announced your restructuring plan," he said. </p>
      <p>Xerox isn't the only one pushing for a deal; Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, who holds a 10.6 per cent stake in Xerox and a 4.24 per cent stake in HP, <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3083780/carl-icahn-urges-hp-xerox-merger">pushed for a merger of the two companies</a>. </p>
      <p>"I think a combination is a no-brainer," Icahn told <i>the WSJ</i><i>, adding </i>in that he strongly believes "in the synergies" the two companies would enjoy if they combined.</p>
      <p>"There will probably be a choice between cash and stock and I would much rather have the stock, assuming there's a good management team," he added. µ</p>
