      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:44:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:44</time> by <a rel="author">Melisha Kaur, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/melisha-kaur/</a></address>
      <p>'Tis the season to spoil your loved ones (or yourself) and <a href="https://fave.co/2D4T9PF">Glossybox</a> has the perfect beauty gift on its way.</p>
      <p>Just in time for the festive period, the beauty giant is launching a limited-edition <a href="https://fave.co/2qpqItn">Christmas box</a> filled with over £130 worth of prettifying and pampering goodies.</p>
      <p>Inside the gloriously designed box are 11 must-have products from the likes of <a href="https://fave.co/2rcC3gk">Huda Beauty</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/339ALQv">NARS</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/2rjbp5d">Laura Mercier</a> and <a href="https://fave.co/2s5MW3W">bareMinerals</a>.</p>
      <p>The best part? Shoppers can get their hands on one for a bargain price of £35 - unless you're a Glossybox subscriber, in which case you only pay £30.</p>

      <p>It'll be available at <a href="https://fave.co/2qpqItn">glossybox.co.uk</a> from 7am on Monday December 2nd, with subscribers able to buy the box from 12pm on the same day.</p>
      <p>Eleanore Nash, Editor at Glossybox UK, said: "To celebrate the end of 2019, we’ve curated our best Limited Edition yet. The iconic HUDA palette allows you to create endless shimmery party looks, while the award-winning NARS blush will give you the healthy, rosy glow you need this time of year.</p>
      <p>"We’re also really excited to be introducing beauty lovers to bareMinerals’ first-of-its kind vegan moisturiser infused with a mineral SPF. This box really does feature some of the hottest beauty brands out there!"</p>
      <p>The beautiful box boasts the same rose gold packaging as the 2019 Glossybox advent calendar, which was an instant sell-out.</p>
      <p>If you missed out on the brand's annual countdown, then this new festive box provides another great way to enjoy some of the best beauty brands around.</p>
      <p>However beauty fans will need to be fast, because some of the brand's previous limited-edition boxes have sold in less than half an hour.</p>
      <p>The collection includes a <a href="https://fave.co/2XB36xK">Huda Beauty eyeshadow palette</a> worth £25 and a <a href="https://fave.co/338GK83">Luxie</a> eyeshadow brush worth £14, which will certainly come in handy for those upcoming <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> parties.</p>
