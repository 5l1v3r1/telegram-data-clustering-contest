        <b>Liverpool and Manchester United have been warned that Ben White is not for sale after the Brighton defender’s impressive displays on loan at Leeds.</b>
      </p>
      <p>White has become an integral part of Marcelo Bielsa’s defence at Leeds, sparking reports that the two <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/liverpool-man-utd-eye-deal-for-loan-star-bossing-the-championship"><b>Premier League heavyweights were weighing up January moves</b></a> for the centre-back.</p>
      <p>But Brighton boss Graham Potter has stated that <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/ben-white"><b>White’s</b></a> future is with the Seagulls – and says the south coast club are not interested in selling him.</p>
      <p>“There’s all sorts of talk as we know, but the reality is he’s our player and has a future here,” Potter said ahead of Brighton’s Premier League clash at home to Leicester on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“He’s on loan now at Leeds and having a positive experience, and we’re delighted with that.</p>
      <p>“But we’re looking forward to having him back at the right time and we’ll go from there.</p>
      <p>“He’s our player, he’s contracted with us.”</p>
