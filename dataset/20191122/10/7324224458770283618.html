      <p>Labour is bidding for your vote by pledging to build 100,000 new council homes a year by 2024.</p>
      <p>But hold on, what’s this? Yes, the Tories want your vote too, by saying they will deliver a million homes over five years, and help first-time buyers.</p>
      <p>There are awkward questions. Where are the houses going to be built, and will the planning mechanisms be able to cope with those ambitious timescales?</p>
      <p>And is there a sufficient reservoir of skilled labour that will make such huge building programmes feasible?</p>
      <p>Political parties have talked the talk on housing but when it’s come to delivery, there has been disappointment, and to a certain extent that is because many of the factors which largely govern the market are not susceptible to political control.</p>
      <p>House prices have periodically surged, crushing the dreams of those saving in the hope of gaining a foothold on the housing ladder.</p>
      <p>The credit crisis led to lenders adopting a more cautious approach, adding to the difficulties. There is demand, a yearning among young people to buy their own home, but it isn’t at any price.</p>
      <p>Building lots of new homes sounds like it will rebalance the supply and demand equation, by churning out the supply to meet the demand.</p>
      <p>However, if those houses are out of the price reach of those who aspire to buy, all that will happen is the “haves” have more home-buying choices, while the “have-nots” continue to be shut out.</p>
      <p>The other way to get a home is to rent.</p>
      <p>Housing experts are agreed about the need, but opinions are divided about whether Labour could deliver on its council housing promises.</p>
      <p>It would require a monumental effort in a programme which would cost many billions of pounds.</p>
      <p>Yet while market forces have been no friend to people trying to buy a home, in the rental sector, the government, through council housing, can at least exert some control.</p>
      <p>The reality is that even if these political promises are honoured in full, it’s going to take years for their impact to be felt.</p>
