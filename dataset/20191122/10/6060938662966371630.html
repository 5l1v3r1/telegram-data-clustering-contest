      <p>Ileana D’Cruz is one of the most beautiful and popular actresses we have in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bollywood">Bollywood</a>. The actress has not only shared screen space with some very good and talented actors but also has been a part of some big movies in the industry. Ileana’s pairing with actor Ajay Devgn has especially been liked and appreciated by the audience. The actors have worked together in ‘Raid’ and ‘Baadshaho’. Recently, Ileana was all praise for Ajay in an interview. Speaking about her working experience with Ajay, Ileana reportedly said that he is one of the easiest to work with. She also added that she once appreciated Ajay delivering an intense dialogue with ease and he replied back by saying that he is just lazy and that he just says it without over thinking.</p>
      <p>Elaborating further, Ileana added that there is always an easy vibe around him on the set. It never feels that he is working and so everyone around him is also relaxed.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, on the work front, she is seen in ‘Pagalpanti’ which hit the theatres today, November 22, 2019.</p>
      <p>Ajay, on the other hand, is gearing up for the release of his upcoming historic drama, ‘Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior’.
