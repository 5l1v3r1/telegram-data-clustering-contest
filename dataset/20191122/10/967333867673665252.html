        <b>MOSCOW (Sputnik) - An arrest warrant has been issued for Bolivia’s former Culture Minister Wilma Alanoca on suspicion of corruption and involvement in the manufacture and storage of Molotov cocktails, Bolivian newspaper Pagina Siete reported.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The order was issued at the request of the Attorney General after police questioned the ex-minister's secretary, Pagina Siete said on Thursday.</p>
      <blockquote>"A case has been opened regarding Alanoca. Several warrants have been issued, we are in the process of executing them," Christian Saavedra, Special Police Department (FELCC) deputy chief, said.</blockquote>
      <p>According to him, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911221077371578-us-calls-on-bolivia-officials-to-step-aside-recognizes-transition-government---pompeo/">Molotov cocktails were discovered</a> in one of the buildings of the Ministry of Culture.

      <p>Bolivia plunged into crisis following the 20 October presidential election, which saw longtime president Evo Morales secure his fourth term in the first round. However, the opposition <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911211077363083-bolivia-how-anez-nullified-13-years-of-morales-govts-achievements-in-one-week/">refused to accept the vote results,</a> citing alleged irregularities in the vote-counting process, which were subsequently confirmed by the Organisation of American States.</p>
      <p>On 10 November, Morales stepped down and subsequently fled to Mexico. Bolivia's highest-ranking officials resigned as well. Jeanine Anez, then the opposition deputy speaker of the upper house, declared herself interim president. However, the ex-president's supporters took the streets to protest against Anez's government, which led to violent clashes with security officers.</p>
