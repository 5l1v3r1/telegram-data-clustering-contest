      <h1>Titans Season 2 Finale Trailer Introduces Dick Grayson as Nightwing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:11:04+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:11</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Arvedon</a></address>
      <p>DC Universe has released the trailer for the Season 2 finale ofÂ <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/titans-tv/"><i>Titans</i></a>, which features the first official look at Brenton Thwaites' Dick Grayson as Nightwing.</p>
      <p>After Raven reveals she's been having a recurring dream in which she's killed by Deathstroke as a shot of a coffin appears on-screen, the words "A Titan Will Fall" appear, followed by "Another Will Rise." Then, as Deathstroke fires on the Titans, Dick Grayson arrives in full Nightwing costume to fend off the mercenary.</p>

      <p>Speaking of Titans falling, it's worth noting that in the final shot of the trailer, we see Dick, Rose, Dawn, Kory, Conner and Hank all dressed in black, presumably at a funeral, but no Jason Todd. Could he follow in the footsteps of his comic book counterpart?</p>
      <p>Streaming now on DC Universe, <a href="https://screenrant.com/titans-season-2-original-characters-forgot-starfire-raven/"><i>Titans</i> Season 2</a> stars Brenton Thwaites as Dick Grayson, Anna Diop as Kory Anders, Teagan Croft as Rachel Roth, Ryan Potter as Garfield Logan, Curran Walters as Jason Todd and Conor Leslie as Donna Troy, with Minka Kelly as Dawn Granger, Alan Ritchson as Hank Hall, Joshua Orpin as Superboy, Chelsea Zhang as Rose Wilson, Chella Man as Jericho, Drew Van Acker as Aqualad, Esai Morales as Deathstroke and Iain Glen as Bruce Wayne.</p>
