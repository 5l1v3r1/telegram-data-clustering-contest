      <h1>New road leaves flooding nightmare for 89-year-old June</h1>
      <h2>It's been happening for over a year since improvements to the Kingskerswell road junction</h2>

      <p>A new road through Kingskerswell is causing flood water to pour into the home of an 89-year-old woman who has had to sandbag her doorway.</p>
      <p>Now she is appealing for the problem to be sorted before serious damage is done. Devon County Council says it will tackle the flooding misery. <br/>June Marshall lives at Westhill House, and changes to the junction outside her home have triggered the deluge.</p>
      <p>Her daughter Hazel Blease said: “I am desperate for my mum’s situation to be highlighted.”</p>

      <p>Mrs Marshall has lived at Westill house, opposite the Sloop pub, for nearly 10 years and has never had an issue with flooding.</p>
      <p>Her daughter said: “The warden has been there for 17 years and has never known of any flooding to this property.” <br/>Mrs Blease says the council decided to change the dynamics of the road immediately outside her mother’s home, and now the flow of rain water from the bridge at the Lord Nelson pub follows the road when the rain is heavy. The torrent collects leaves and rubbish, carries this down the road and across a public path, covering drains along the way. <br/>“It ends up outside my mum’s front door,” said Mrs Blease. “The drain there has been completely covered with leaves and mess, leaving the water unable to drain away, and it then rushes into my mum’s home. Last year at the same time mum was flooded twice, in the first year of the road being completed.” <br/>She said she had spoken to her local councillor to stress the water flow should not follow the road and then come on to the path. <br/>She says she was told it would be a priority, but despite reminding the council, no work has been done.</p>
      <p>“I am so angry and upset for my mum,” said Mrs Blease. “Last year, so many times, I would pop in to see mum and she would be in tears because of the upheaval, the disturbance and the inability to cope with all the many things that had to be done to sort her home. <br/>“That breaks my heart. I moved my mother here from Kent so that she would have no worries and be in a lovely place where she could spend the rest of her days care free. This is now a nightmare.” <br/>The council has said it intends to put in bigger drains, but Mrs Blease says the design of the new road junction is the problem, sending water straight across the path. And, she added: “While they are practising at getting it right my mum still gets flooded – and next year will be the same!”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Devon County Council said: “We are sorry to hear that Mrs Marshall’s home was flooded. The junction was changed in 2016 and we have recently been made aware of problems at this location. <br/>“Work to improve the drainage capacity of the road will be carried out. This will consist of adding a new gully and increasing the capacity of an existing gully.”</p>
