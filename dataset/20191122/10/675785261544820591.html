      <h1>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer doesn't feel pressure at Man Utd with Mauricio Pochettino on market</h1>
      <h2>Mauricio Pochettino, who has previously been heavily linked with the Man Utd job, was sacked by Tottenham earlier this week with Jose Mourinho taking his place in north London</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:00:12+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says he does not feel under extra pressure with former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> boss Mauricio Pochettino now out of work and on the market.</p>
      <p>Pochettino, sacked by Spurs on Tuesday, was wanted by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> before the Reds decided to appoint caretaker boss Solskjaer on a permanent basis back in March.</p>
      <p>But Solskjaer, who said he welcomed the return of his United predecessor, Jose Mourinho, who has taken charge at Spurs, insisted he does not feel under threat by the spectre of Pochettino.</p>
      <p>“No, it doesn't bother me at all,” said Solskjaer. “I've got the best job in the world and if you're in or out of a job, you want this job, so it doesn't really matter whatever happens around it.</p>

      <p>“I've got to focus on my job at Manchester United and do it as well as we can.</p>
      <p>“I speak with Ed [Woodward, United's executive vice-chairman] and the owners all the time about how we move forward, and that doesn't change if others change managers.</p>
      <p>“It's good to have Jose back, definitely, especially for you guys and maybe for me, because you can talk and write about everything else.</p>

      <p>“For Mauricio, it's always sad when one of your colleagues, a good man, loses his job, especially before Christmas, so I wish him all the best.</p>
      <p>Asked if he was surprised at Pochettino's sacking, just six months after he guided Spurs to the Champions League final, Solskjaer said: “In football you can never be surprised or shocked, but I've just got to focus on us.”</p>
      <p>Solskjaer refused to criticise Nemanja Matic for liking a social media post that suggested Mourinho would try to sign the United midfielder in January.</p>
      <p>The United boss, who had previously called on his players to be boring on social media, said: "That's not a part of being boring when it's like this.</p>
      <p>"You like Jose coming back, it's going be a spectacle and a circus and Nemanja has a sense of humour."</p>
