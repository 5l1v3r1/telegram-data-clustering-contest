      <h3>CABANATUAN CITY – The National Irrigation Administration-Upper Pampanga River Integrated Irrigation Systems on Wednesday spearheaded a covenant-signing among its numerous stakeholders here for a faster and more efficient implementation of irrigation projects for the economic well-being of the local farmers in Central Luzon.</h3>
      <p>Dubbed “the 2nd Stakeholders’ Forum on Irrigation Development for the province of Nueva Ecija,” NIA administrator Ricardo R. Visaya forged a covenant with all the stakeholders in committing their all-out support for the agency’s irrigation development programs for the province of Nueva Ecija.   </p>
      <p>NIA-UPRIIS head Engr. Rosalinda B. Bote said the forum also aims to commit the stakeholders in providing assistance to the agency in terms of helping them resolve issues about the peace and order situation in a given area or those that involve right-of-way problems, or conflicts among irrigation water users.</p>
