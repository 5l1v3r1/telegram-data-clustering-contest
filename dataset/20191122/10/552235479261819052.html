      <h2>Perth For Europe has been actively leafleting people to encourage tactical voting against Conservative campaigns</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:46:21+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:46</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Clark, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/rachel-clark/</a></address>
      <p>A campaign group has said it has not been able to arrange a hustings in the run-up to the general election, after their invitations to attend were turned down by both Perthshire’s Conservative candidates.</p>
      <p>Perth for Europe had hoped to hold the hustings with all the political candidates from both the Perth and North Perthshire and the Ochil and South Perthshire constituencies.</p>
      <p>However, the group says both Luke Graham (Conservative candidate for Ochil and South Perthshire) and Angus Forbes (Conservative candidate for Perth and North Perthshire) declined to attend, meaning the hustings has been cancelled.</p>
      <p>It is understood separate hustings organised by churches will be held instead.</p>
      <p>Perth For Europe has been actively leafleting people to encourage tactical voting to stop the two Tories winning the seats.</p>
      <p>Andrew Syme, secretary of Perth for Europe, said: “We invited candidates in both wards to attend the hustings.</p>
      <p>“We got no reply at first from the Conservative candidates, and then excuses for why they couldn’t do it.</p>
      <p>“It is disappointing the Conservatives would not accept our invitation in either constituency as we would have guaranteed a neutral chair and we have held successful evenings before.</p>
      <p>“Luke Graham said no because we are campaigning against him.</p>
      <p>“We are anti-Brexit - the only reason we are anti-Conservative is because they are so pro-Brexit.</p>
      <p>“We actually have Conservative members of our group.</p>
      <p>“It had been hoped to hold the hustings next week, but both Conservative candidates have made themselves unavailable.”</p>
      <p>During a visit by Theresa May to Perth on Tuesday, Mr Graham touched on the subject of tactical voting, telling the PA: “Perth for Europe is an anti-Conservative group, and if you want a SNP MP and a second independence referendum, follow their guidelines.”</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Mr Graham said yesterday: “Luke has attend debates with Perth for Europe for the past two years.</p>
      <p>“What has been revealed in the last few weeks is that they’re an aggressively anti-Conservative and Unionist pro-Nationalist group desperate to get the SNP into Ochil and South Perthshire.</p>
      <p>“Luke will be participating in hustings hosted by unbiased groups across the constituency in Alloa, Bridge of Earn and Dollar, and looks forward to standing on his record of delivering over 300 surgeries, dealing with over 8000 constituent issues, and bringing £70 million pounds worth of investment to Perth and Kinross and Clackmannanshire in just two years.”</p>
      <p>Angus Forbes, who is standing for the Tories in Perth and North Perthshire, said: “Perth for Europe invited me to a hustings event next week.</p>
      <p>“Due to work commitments I was unable to attend that particular night and we agreed that we would try to find another suitable date.</p>
      <p>“In the interim period, one of the churches arranged a separate event and Perth for Europe emailed me yesterday to say they were going to attend that event instead.</p>
      <p>“I am happy to attend any event that I can but I must be mindful of the fact that I have a business to run and serious responsibilities to Perth and Kinross Council as a committee convener as well as daily campaigning activities.”</p>
