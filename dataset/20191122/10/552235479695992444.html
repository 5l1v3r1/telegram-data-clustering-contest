      <p>Thousands of Scots have been left without access to their wages after payments failed to go through.</p>
      <p>Customers have taken to social media to claim they have not been paid - with earnings, benefits, pensions and other payments still outstanding, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/breaking-thousands-tsb-bank-customers-20934337">the Mirror</a> reports.</p>
      <p>The glitch is affecting TSB customers with the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/banks">bank</a> saying it is experiencing some 'delays' to payments.</p>
      <p>The bank said a "small number" of customers failed to receive payments due in on Friday, and it has been forced to offer emergency cash to those affected.</p>
      <p>Customers who may have incurred extra costs due to the late payments have to keep receipts and can claim once the issue has been resolved.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A TSB statement reads: "Some payments into TSB accounts have been delayed overnight and we are working to process these as soon as possible today.</p>
      <p>"We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and will ensure customers are not left out of pocket."</p>
      <p>If you've incurred any extra costs due to today's outage, keep hold of any receipts, call logs and invoices which you can use to make a claim once the issue has been resolved.</p>
      <p>"If TSB customers need emergency cash or have any questions they can visit us in branch or contact us via the number on the back of their card," a statement added.</p>
      <p>"Customers can still use their cards to make payments or withdraw cash."</p>
      <p>Reader Kerry Louise said she's been unable to pay for a deposit on a flat this morning, waking up to "nothing" on the day her £900 payment is due.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"I was expecting my wages this morning and woke up with nothing. I have an appointment before work to put a deposit down for a flat and now cannot do this.</p>
      <p>"TSB have ruined everything. I am heartbroken. There's been no explanation, no time limit or anything. This is happening too often and I will be changing banks after this. I cannot believe it," the customer explained.</p>
