      <p>Bolton Wanderers have been handed a suspended five-point deduction and financial penalties after being found guilty of failing to fulfil their fixtures against Brentford and Doncaster Rovers this year, the English Football League (EFL) has said.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Bolton Wanderers have been handed a suspended five-point deduction and financial penalties after being found guilty of failing to fulfil their fixtures against Brentford and Doncaster Rovers this year, the English Football League (EFL) has said.</p>
      <p>Bolton's final Championship (second tier) match last season against Brentford was postponed and later cancelled after players boycotted the game over unpaid wages.</p>

      <p>This season, their fourth League One game against Doncaster in August was postponed as the club, who fielded only three senior players in a game three days earlier, was concerned about the welfare of their younger players.</p>
      <p>"The independent panel has ruled that Bolton Wanderers will be subject to a two-point deduction for the fixture against Brentford and a further three points for the match against Doncaster Rovers," the EFL said in a statement https://www.efl.com/news/2019/november/efl-statement-bolton-wanderers.</p>
      <p>"Both penalties are suspended for 18 months and will not be activated as long as the club is not subject to a further misconduct charge for non-fulfilment of fixtures in that timeframe."</p>
      <p>The club was also fined a total of 70,000 pounds (US$90,426) in penalties for not playing the two fixtures, with half the amount suspended for 18 months.</p>
      <p>Bolton, who started this season with a 12-point deduction after going into administration, are bottom of the standings with one point after 14 games and play Accrington Stanley on Saturday.</p>
