      <p>Government-backed Israeli settlements in West Bank, in Palestine, and East Jerusalem regions have grown exponentially, both in number and population, since the 1967 war.</p>
      <p>By promoting them, Israel continues to defy international law - the UN Security Council had condemned settlements in a resolution passed in 2016.</p>
      <p><b>Rising over time</b><br/>Over four lakh people resided in 131 government-sanctioned Israeli settlements in the West Bank region, as of 2017. More than two lakh resided in at least 11 settlements in East Jerusalem, as of 2016. Around 700 settlers resided in the Hebron region in 2017.</p>
