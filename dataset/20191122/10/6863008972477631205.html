      <p>An elite Ukrainian police unit has apprehended a suspected 30-year-old member of the Islamic State (IS) extremist group in Zhytomyr region west of Kyiv.</p>
      <p>The Russian citizen was detained based on an Interpol notice related to murder and was hiding in Ukraine to evade arrest, <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-detains-suspected-islamic-state-group-leader/30285108.html">Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported</a>, citing the <a href="https://www.npu.gov.ua/news/rozshuk/u-zhitomiri-policzejski-zatrimali-rozshukovanogo-Interpolom-inozemczya/">National Police's statement</a> on November 21.</p>
      <p>The unnamed suspect was born in the easternmost Ukrainian region of Luhansk but had lived in Russia for an extended period.</p>
      <p>"According to reports, the detainee is a member of the terrorist radical organization Islamic State and even the leader of one of its groups," the police said.</p>

      <p>"By ethnicity, he is Daghestani, but was born in Luhansk region, Ukraine. He lived in Russia for a long time. He was hiding in the territory of our country in order to avoid responsibility for murder."</p>
      <p>He is facing extradition.</p>
      <p>Last week, Ukrainian authorities, in coordination with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and Georgia's Interior Ministry, detained Al-Bara Shishani, a top IS commander.</p>
      <p>The Georgian national had served as a deputy to Abu Omar al-Shishani, the man the Pentagon has described as the militant group's "minister of war."</p>
      <p>After the latter was killed in 2016, Al-Bara Shishani fled to Turkey and in 2018 used a fake passport to enter Ukraine, where he continued to coordinate IS activities, Ukraine's State Security Service (SBU) said.</p>
      <p>He was detained in Kyiv region near a private home where he resided, the SBU said.</p>
