      <h1>Martyn Williams has become the fourth former Wales captain to join Wayne Pivac's staff</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:36:05+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:36</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Test centurion Martyn Williams has landed himself a new rugby role – working as team manager for Wayne Pivac’s <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> when Alan Phillips moves on at the start of 2020 to take on a directory of operations role with the British and Irish Lions.</p>
      <p>Williams becomes the fourth former Wales captain to join head coach Pivac’s new management team alongside Stephen Jones, Jonathan Humphreys and Sam Warburton.</p>
      <p>The former flanker called time on his 16-year international career in 2012 and has since combined his business career with media commitments. He has been head of business development at JP Private Clients and St James Place since retiring and will remain a partner of the business.</p>
      <p>Williams has extensive experience of both the international and domestic game with wide-reaching relationships and management experience. “Martyn is a fantastic appointment for us and it is great to have someone of his stature and experience in the role,” said Pivac.</p>
      <p>“Martyn has a wealth of international experience, 100 caps for Wales and three British and Irish <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/lions">Lions</a> tours under his belt so he understands the Test scene. He is hugely respected across the game and I believe he will be a great addition to our management team.</p>

      <p>“<a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/gavin-henson-slates-residency-rules-after-two-more-kiwis-become-welsh/">He will spend a few days with us next week as part of the Barbarians match preparations</a> and will be in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> with me next month as part of the planning recce ahead of next summer’s tour and then will begin the role full-time in January and I’m really looking forward to working with him.”</p>
      <p>Williams added: “Wayne has put together an experienced management team and we have an excellent crop of players here in Wales and I’m looking forward to working with them all. I hope to bring not only my rugby experience but experiences I have gathered from the world of business to role and help the squad in any way I can.”</p>
      <p>Phillips, meanwhile, said: “The British and Irish Lions has a very special place in my heart and it is a tremendous organisation. As a former Lion, I know how special the Lions are across the game and I’m excited to be part of the set-up and to help deliver one of the most memorable and enjoyable tours in 2021.”</p>
