        <b>Floyd Mayweather has said he is coming out of retirement in 2020, working with UFC president Dana White "to bring the world another spectacular event".</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mayweather, the former five-weight world champion, said he was hanging up his gloves in 2017 after defeating UFC star Conor McGregor in a boxing match in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>The American did also come out of retirement momentarily on New Year's Day for a one-off exhibition bout with Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa, knocking him down three times in the first round to win the fight.</p>

      <p>But it looks like Mayweather is coming back based on his recent activity on Instagram.</p>
      <p>The 50-0 fighter posted an image of himself and UFC boss White with the caption: "Dana White and I working together again to bring the world another spectacular event in 2020."</p>
      <p>It was followed by another post, saying: "Coming out of retirement in 2020."</p>

      <p>White reposted both of Mayweather's uploads.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Mayweather said he would not be returning to boxing to protect his health.</p>
      <p>"I've got calls to get back into the ring, but my health is my wealth," said Mayweather.</p>
      <p>"Boxing is a very, very brutal sport. In the last few years, a lot of fighters have died inside that squared circle.</p>
      <p>"You have got to know when to hang it up. I had a great career."</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old says his only future fights will be exhibitions, like the one in January which saw him demolish Nasukawa in less than three minutes.</p>
      <p>"I'll still travel and do exhibitions," said Mayweather. "I make great money doing exhibitions - between $10m and $30m.</p>
      <p>"I think I make more doing that than most fighters make fighting."</p>
