      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:59:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:59</time> by <a rel="author">Hayley Parker, Christopher Harper</a></address>
      <p>Around 60 schools have been struck by a serious vomiting bug in the UK.</p>
      <p>A Norovirus outbreak has hit schools in the North East and yesterday, a hospital in Stoke had to shut wards after an outbreak.</p>
      <p>Two wards at Crewe's Leighton Hospital were forced to close yesterday, reports <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/norovirus-warning-60-schools-england-3564733">Stoke-on-Trent Live</a> .</p>
      <p>Statistics published yesterday suggested norovirus rates are 26 per cent higher than they usually are at this time of year.</p>
      <p>A total of 332 people are confirmed by Public Health England to have had the bug between October 28 and November 10, with 18 outbreaks closing hospital wards across England and Wales, according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-7710563/Norovirus-warning-winter-vomiting-bug-rates-26-higher-average.html">Daily Mail</a> .</p>
      <p>Health officials have again warned people with symptoms of the illness not to go to hospitals or GP surgeries because they might spread it to others.</p>

      <p>Some schools have even been forced to close in County Durham due to the outbreak.</p>
      <p>Dr Gayle Dolan, consultant in health protection for PHE North East, told <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/virus-60-north-east-schools-17292996?_ga=2.34900387.322341637.1574408632-1046568317.1574406441">Chronicle Live</a> : "Around 60 schools across the region are reporting absences due to symptoms of likely viral illness including influenza (flu) and norovirus.</p>
      <p>"We expect viral illnesses of this kind to circulate in schools and the community at this time of year and we have been providing advice to parents and schools to help reduce the spread of infection."</p>
      <p>Nick Phin, spokesman for Public Health England, said: "Cases of norovirus are at levels slightly higher than we would expect to see at this time of year.</p>
      <p>"These levels are not unprecedented as norovirus activity varies from year to year and we continue to actively monitor the situation.</p>
      <p>"We advise people not to visit GP surgeries and hospitals with symptoms, however if they are concerned they should contact NHS 111 or talk to their GP by phone."</p>
      <h3>What is Norovirus?</h3>
      <p>Norovirus is just a stomach bug, but it can be very nasty and causes diarrhoea and vomiting.</p>
      <p>It is sometimes known as the "winter vomiting bug" because it's more common at this time of year, although you can catch it year round.</p>
      <p>As unpleasant as it is, it usually clears up after a few days.</p>
      <h3>Should you visit the GP?</h3>
      <p>No, Norovirus can spread to others very easily so visiting the GP can often do more harm than good. If you are worried though, you can call your GP or the NHS 24 ' 111 ' service if you're concerned or need any advice.</p>
      <h3>What are the symptoms?</h3>
      <p>The symptoms of Norovirus are very distinctive.</p>
      <p>You're likely to have Norovirus if you experience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>suddenly feeling sick</li>
        <li>projectile vomiting</li>
        <li>watery diarrhoea</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some people also have a slight fever, headaches , painful stomach cramps and aching limbs.</p>
      <p>The symptoms appear one to two days after you become infected and typically last for up to two or three days.</p>
      <h3>How to treat Norovirus</h3>
      <p>Sadly, there isn't too much you can do to help get rid of Norovirus, there is no cure but doing these things can help:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration . You need to drink more than usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea – as well as water, adults could also try fruit juice and soup.</li>
        <li>take paracetamol for any fever or aches and pains.</li>
        <li>get plenty of rest.</li>
        <li>if you feel like eating, eat plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread.</li>
        <li>use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmacies if you have signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth or dark urine – read more about treating dehydration.</li>
      </ul>
