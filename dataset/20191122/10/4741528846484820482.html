      <h1>Nigeria’s GDP grew by 2.28% in Q3 2019, as border closure hits trade sector</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:13:16+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/samuel-bamidele/" target="_blank">Bamidele Samuel Adesoji</a></address>
      <p>Nigeria’s <b>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</b> grew by 2.28% in real terms, in the third quarter (Q3) of 2019, up from 1.81% growth recorded in the third quarter of 2018. This means there was a 0.47% points increase in growth of the Nigerian economy (year-on-year).</p>
      <p>According to the data released by the <a href="https://nigerianstat.gov.ng/elibrary">National Bureau of Statistics</a> (NBS), the Nigerian economy grew by 2.28% in Q3 2019, up from 2.12% growth recorded in Q2 2019. This indicates an increase of 0.17% points between Q2 and Q3 2019 (Quarter on Quarter).</p>
      <p><b>Growth overview</b>: A quick breakdown shows that the Oil sector grew by 6.49% from the 7.17% growth recorded in the previous quarter. This means the oil sector grew at a slower rate.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>On the other hand, non-oil GDP maintained a slow growth of 1.85% in Q3 2019, from 1.64% in the previous quarter.</li>
        <li>According to the report, Nigeria’s aggregate GDP stood at N37.8 trillion in nominal terms, an increase of 13.30% over the performance posted in Q3 2018.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>The Oil Sector</b>: In Q3 2019, the oil sector of the Nigerian economy posted a strong performance with a 9.40% point increase relative to the rate recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2018.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Notably, the oil sector grew high by 6.49% in the Q3 2019, as against -2.91% dip recorded in Q3 2018. However, the latest growth in the sector showed a dip when compared to 7.17% growth recorded in Q2 2019.</li>
        <li>In terms of contribution, the oil sector contributed 9.77% to total real GDP in Q3 2019, up from 8.98% recorded in the corresponding quarter.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>The Non-Oil Sector</b>: The report shows that Nigeria’s non-oil sector contracted in Q3 2019. The non-oil sector grew by 1.85% in real terms during the quarter under review. This was –0.48% points lower than the figure recorded in the same quarter of 2018 (2.32%), but 0.20% point higher than the second quarter of 2019 (1.64%).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>During the quarter, the growth in the non-oil sector was driven mainly by sectors which include agriculture, Information and Communication, accommodation and food services, transportation and storage,</li>
        <li>In terms of contributions to GDP, the non-Oil sector remains the biggest contributor to GDP.</li>
        <li>The sector contributed 90.23% to the nation’s GDP, lower than the share recorded in the third quarter of 2018 (90.62%).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Key Sectors’ performance</b>: Major sectors that witnessed decline in growth include trade sector and the real estate. Specifically, in real term the trade sector contracted by -1.45% in Q3 2019, down from 0.98% in Q3 2018. The big contraction recorded in the sector maybe largely attributed to the closure of the country’s land borders. Recall, that Nigeria closed its land border in August 2019.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Also, the real estate sector continued in its low ebb as it contracted by -2.31%, from -3.84% recorded in Q2 2019, and -2.68% in Q3 2018.</li>
        <li>The industrial sector recorded the highest growth of 3.12% when compared with other sectors, followed by agricultural sector which grew to 2.28%, while the service sector slowed down with a growth of 1.87%.</li>
        <li>On the other hand, the agricultural sector’s contribution to GDP improved to 29.25%, higher than the second quarter of 2019 which stood at 22.78%, this mean that agriculture contribution in Q3 2019 rose by 6.46% points.</li>
        <li>Manufacturing sector grew by 1.10% in Q3 2019 from 1.92% in Q3 2018. This also means the sector slowed year-on-year.</li>
        <li>Also, the sector contribution to GDP stood at 8.74%, lower than the 8.84% recorded in third quarter of 2018 and the 9.08% recorded in Q2 2019.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>The Key takeaways: </b>GDP is Nigeria’s biggest economic data, and it measures the monetary value of everything produced in the country. It depicts the nation’s total economic activity. A decline in GDP means major economic activities are slow or sluggish, which may be a result of several factors.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For the latest data, the economic growth of 2.28% shows an improved performance when compared to the third quarter of 2018 (1.81%). According to NBS, the improvement in GDP was likely aided by stability in oil output.</li>
        <li>However, the 2.28% GDP growth suggests the economy posted the biggest growth in the year.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, the service sector recorded the slowest growth in the year. This is not good for the economy as the sector represents the largest contributor to the nation’s GDP.</li>
        <li>On the positive side, the industrial sector posted the biggest growth for the past six quarters.</li>
        <li>Expectations are high for the Nigerian economy as the world bank’s 2.1% annual growth forecast for 2019 may eventually be surpassed.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, spill-over effects of the border closure may pose further threat to the economy going into 2020.</li>
      </ul>
