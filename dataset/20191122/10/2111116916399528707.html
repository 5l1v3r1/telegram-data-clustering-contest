      <p>Sony headphones are among the best cans you can buy right now, especially if you're looking for wireless or noise-cancelling over-ear headphones – and now some models are discounted in <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/amazon-black-friday-deals-2019">Amazon's Black Friday sales</a>. </p>
      <p>Right now, you can get the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/sony-wh-xb900n">Sony WH-XB900N</a> for £128 – that's £40 off the £179 recommended retail price. These wireless headphones support Sony's Extra Bass technology, which enhances the low-end frequencies to produce a deeper, more powerful bass.</p>
      <p>Pair this up with the brand's industry-leading noise cancellation, and you’ve got the perfect hybrid headphones for bass lovers who want to block out the world around them. </p>

      <p>Even Sony's budget headphones have been given a discount in Amazon's Black Friday sales; you can save a very respectable £20 on the Sony WH-CH700N, which our sister site What Hi-Fi? praised for their detailed musical performance. </p>
