      <p>Two London Underground stations were evacuated during the Friday morning rush hour after testing of fans created a dust cloud.</p>
      <p>Canary Wharf and Canada Water stations were closed for around 10 minutes when the incident happened shortly after 9.15am.</p>
      <p>A Transport for London (TfL) spokeswoman said: “We were doing testing of fans in the tunnels. It inadvertently created a dust cloud so we evacuated the stations.”</p>

      <p>Owen Smith, who was one of those affected at Canada Water, said he thought there was “some sort of gas or smoke”.</p>
      <p>He added that “everyone was very calm” and described the station staff as “a credit to TfL”.</p>
