      <blockquote>Have you ever had to pretend that you’re traveling out of town just to discharge woman??<br/><br/>So I and one twitter sweetheart have been talking to each other for a while. It really did go down in the DMs. She stays in Abuja and I jokingly teased one Friday morning that my weekend would be interesting if she spent it with me at home. She laughed about it and agreed.<br/><br/>I didn’t really expect her to agree so it was a pleasant surprise. I finished work early that day and went home to cook, clean and prepare for August visitor.<br/><br/>She said she would be coming in the evening. I prepared by 3pm sef. Early bird. Early worm. Early knacks.<br/><br/>She came as she promised and to cut the long story short, by Saturday morning, I was already tired of her. But the weekend wasn’t nearly over so I had to enjoy the boredom of her company one more night. She wasn’t really boring, i just think that we had different interests.<br/><br/>By Sunday evening, I thought she would be preparing to leave but babe was not bothered. She was seeing a Netflix series. I didn’t want to ask her when she was leaving. Didn’t want to give her the impression that I wanted her to leave. Maybe she would leave in the morning.<br/><br/>Monday morning, as I prepared to go to work, she was still sleeping, I tapped her nicely and told her where to drop the keys for me WHEN she was leaving.<br/><br/>Fam I came back home and met her at home, she had even cooked dinner. Hot tears.<br/><br/>Ahh. Baby, you’re still here?? Of course she was and she didn’t reply.<br/><br/>I ate the dinner like a married man and went outside to see that she had washed her clothes and they were hanging outside in the line.<br/><br/>Her underwear was proudly renting space in my toilet. I don enter.<br/><br/>Ok. Maybe the clothes would be dry by tomorrow morning and she would be gone before I came back from work on Tuesday evening.<br/><br/>I came back and the babe had even washed my own clothes. I couldn’t even express my tiredness of her, she was a nice person.<br/><br/>By Thursday morning, she was now telling me things to buy for her when I was coming back from work.<br/><br/>As I drove to work, I parked by the road and began to ask myself.<br/>“Am I dreaming? Did I marry and forget? Am I in love?”<br/><br/>I still bought what she asked me to buy because idiot<br/><br/>So I called my man and told him what I was going through and in his infinite wisdom as a retired Lagos boy, he told me what to do.<br/><br/>When I got home that Thursday evening I told her that my company was sending me to Benin for a week to inspect our assets.<br/><br/>So that night, a miracle happened, she packed her stuff because I told her I was leaving via road early in the morning.<br/><br/>By 6AM, we were up and I had packed a bag. I was hoping that she would enter a different vehicle and go her way but she insisted to follow me to the bus park.<br/><br/>Ahan babe, that’s unnecessary but she insisted and I had to keep up the lie. So we took Uber to God is good park at Utako. I was hoping she would go her way with the Uber but she wanted to wait until the bus I would enter had left.<br/><br/>Was it love or she dey suspect me?<br/><br/>Fam, I paid N6,500 for the fare and sat down. She came to the window and were professing how much we would miss each other, she even started crying and I felt something, but fam, my head cleared immediately and I maintained my lie.<br/><br/>I promised to call her when I returned<br/><br/>When teh bus got to Giri junction, I told the driver to stop that I was not going again.<br/><br/>“I no go refund you oh” the driver said.<br/><br/>See you, did I tell you I want refund??<br/><br/>Abeg I dey go office, I don dey late.<br/><br/>Fam, this happened early this year but I am still in Benin as far as bothe of us are concerned.<br/><br/>My company decided to make me a permanent staff in Benin.<br/><br/>“Can I come see you in Benin?” She asked.<br/><br/>“I’m staying with my aunty here, dear”</blockquote>
