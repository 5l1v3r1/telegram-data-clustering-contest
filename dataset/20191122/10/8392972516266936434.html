      <p>Jacqueline Jossa screams as she takes on tonight's Bushtucker trial on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a>.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> actress was picked to do the trial by the public last night and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-viewers-concerned-for-jacqueline-jossa-after-shes-picked-for-bushtucker-trial/">she wasn't too pleased</a>.</p>
      <p>ITV has released a preview clip of tonight's trial which sees Jacqueline trying to find stars in a fake hotel room while Myles Stephenson is strapped down in a box outside with snakes all over him.</p>

      <p>In the clip, Jacqueline walks into the room and begins searching for stars.</p>
      <p>She pulls out one drawer which is filled with millworms.</p>

      <p>Ant asks: "You okay?" as Dec says: "What is it?"</p>
      <p>Jacqueline replies: "Yep, yep. Creature worm things. I don't think there's anything in there."</p>
      <p>Dec says: "Four minutes gone, need to get a move on now," to which Myles adds: "Come on Jac, you've got this my darling."</p>

      <p>She moves on to the bed and lifts up the pillow, which is covering two huge snakes.</p>
      <p>She screams again and says: "No! Why would you do that?!"</p>
      <p>Myles says: "You've got this Jac. Ooh I can feel [the snakes] in my hair. It's in the afro," as he's seen holding a star.</p>
      <p>Last night, Jacqueline - who played Lauren Branning in EastEnders - admitted she was worried about facing the trial.</p>
      <p>After it was announced she will be doing the trial, Jacqueline shouted: "No! No!"</p>

      </p>
      <p>She continued: "I'm panicking again. I want to do it with someone else though. Ian [Wright] it could have been the two of us and I feel like I could do it if you were there."</p>
      <p>Viewers have already voiced their worry for Jacqueline and shared their thoughts on Twitter.</p>
      <p>One person said: "I'm already feeling worried for Jacqueline, hope she does well," while another wrote: "I feel for Jacqueline getting that trial tomorrow hope she gets through it."</p>
      <p>Others admitted they had voted for her to do the trial after <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celeb-fans-brand-jacqueline-and-nadine-snakes-as-they-refuse-to-do-challenge/">she refused to participate in a challenge</a> last night.</p>
