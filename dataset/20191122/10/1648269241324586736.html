      <h1>VW Viloran Debuts As Wagon-Like Minivan For China</h1>
      <h2>Another new Volkswagen we can’t get here.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T10:13:41+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 10:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/anthony-alaniz/" target="_blank">Anthony Alaniz</a></address>
      <p>We got our first look at the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/372763/vw-viloran-mpv-china-spied/">VW Viloran back in September</a> when spy photos of the large people mover emerged. Now, two months later, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a> has officially unveiled the wagon-like <a href="https://www.motor1.com/body-styles/minivan/">minivan</a> at the 2019 Guangzhou Auto Show with two other models. It’s VW’s first luxury MPV for China, and it’s scheduled to launch in the first half of next year. </p>
      <p>VW’s press release announcing the new model is light on details. It’ll measure more than 17.3 feet long (5.3 meters) – about the size of the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/chevrolet/traverse/">Chevy Traverse</a> (17 feet) – and will be VW’s largest model. It features a 2-2-3 style cabin layout with executive seats with electric footrests, double headrests, dual-sided automatic sledding doors, and Royal Hall-level Dynaudio audio system. </p>

      <p>The new model is rumored to ride on VW’s MQB platform, the company’s modular platform designed for traverse-mounted, front-engine, front- or all-wheel-drive vehicles. It will underpin much of the VW lineup going forward. Power is said to come from a turbocharged 2.0-liter TSI gasoline engine making 220 horsepower (164 kilowatts) and 258 pound-feet (350 Newton-meters) of torque. It’ll be called the Viloran 380 TSI.</p>
      <p>The Viloran looks more <a href="https://www.motor1.com/body-styles/suv-crossover/">crossover</a> than like a minivan, and that was probably intentional. While minivans do sell, they don’t sell like crossovers. That could explain why the Viloran looks so much more like a <a href="https://www.motor1.com/chrysler/pacifica/">Chrysler Pacifica</a> and less like a <a href="https://www.motor1.com/dodge/grand-caravan/">Dodge Grand Caravan</a>. It has a long hood, steeply raked windshield, and styled hatch. </p>
      <p>Info and photos are just as scarce as the details about the oily bits. However, we can see the second-row captain chairs with the electric footrests and cushioned headrests in the press photos. </p>
      <p>The Volkswagen Viloran will compete against the Buick GL8 and <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/344891/2019-lexus-lm-minivan-revealed/">Lexus LM</a> when it arrives next year in China. Russia could also receive the model, but VW has yet to specify which other markets will get its new minivan. The Viloran was shown at the auto show alongside the Tacqua and Touareg PHEV.</p>
