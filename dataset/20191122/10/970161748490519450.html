      <p>If you haven’t heard of Camille Walala, you’ll definitely have spotted her work and said something along the lines of ‘ooh, pretty colours’.</p>
      <p>She’s a London-based graphic designer and artist who’s known for her graphic lines and bright colours, having created jazzy street crossings, murals, and a mirrored labyrinth in the middle of the city.</p>
      <p>Not to devalue her work, but her art also works wonderfully as a backdrop for an Instagram pic. You’ve definitely spotted some influencers posing against one of her dotted or striped designs.</p>

      <p>Her latest project is an Instagrammer’s dream like the rest.</p>

      <p>Camille teamed up with creative house JustKids to transform an abandoned 1950s petrol station in Arkansas into a piece of public art, plastering it with the bright colours she’s known for.</p>
      <p>What used to be a rundown grey building that faded into the background is now covered with stark black and white lines, massive yellow spots on pink, and a sign declaring the location ‘Walala Pump &amp; Go’.</p>
      <p>That’s quite a lot of painting to be done by one person, so thankfully Camille had the support and collaboration of local artist Nate Myers and a bunch of volunteers – all committed to getting the transformation complete in the space of one week.</p>

      <p>It’s all part of The Unexpected, a project by Justkids to give unexpected (hence the name) public spaces an arty makeover and make them part of the community again.</p>
      <p>In this case we reckon it’s mission accomplished. We doubt many people were stopping by an old petrol station before, but thanks to a lot of paint there’ll be Instagrammers lining up the block.</p>

      <p>‘I love this canvas — it was exciting to do something really bold, that stands out on a bigger scale,’ said Camille. ‘We had a great team of people working with us for a few days, most of them were locals from fort smith who came to help and it has been an amazing execution of the project.’</p>
      <p>Can she come back to London and give our petrol stations a lick of paint next?</p>
