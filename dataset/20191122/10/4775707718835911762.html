      <p>Amazon UK's <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/event/Black-Friday-2019">Black Friday</a> sale has officially begun, and it's kicked off with an interesting deal for those investing in a new PC setup thanks to all of those tempting <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass-pc/games">Xbox Game Pass for PC games</a> – or those who have just started their streaming career. Corsair make premium mechanical gaming keyboards and gaming mice, but they also own Elgato, probably the most well-known streaming capture brand out there. It seems they have teamed up with Amazon UK for a one-day-only sale right at the start of the shopping giant's Black Friday week. Razer have thrown in a few good deals too.</p>
      <p>We've had a scan through the products in this daily deal and picked out those highly-rated options that are actually at a reasonable discount. Consumers have to be careful not to get hoodwinked in an event like Black Friday – some products are in the middle of a general pricing decline anyway. It's not that the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Corsair-Mousepad-Lighting-Micro-Textured-Pass-through/dp/B01LFGOH6A?SubscriptionId=AKIAIR4HVRUPV72R52YQ&amp;tag=gamec01c-21&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953">Corsair MM800 RGB Polaris Hard Surface Mousepad</a> isn't great, and £36.99 is a pretty damned good price for it – but it's not a huge step down from the product's gradually relaxing pricing.</p>
      <p>The same is also true of the company's gaming mouse range and the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Elgato-10GAI9901-Customisable-Stream-Deck-Black/dp/B07DYRS1WH?SubscriptionId=AKIAIR4HVRUPV72R52YQ&amp;tag=gamec01c-21&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953">Elgato Mini stream deck</a>, which frequently yo-yo in price – still a great deal at this discount, but not something you necessarily need to leap on without considering your options. Of the lot, we'd say the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Corsair-Rechargeable-Slipstream-Multi-Colour-Backlighting/dp/B07QD1FP24">Corsair Ironclaw Wireless RGB</a> might be worth a punt at £53.99 down from £70, as it's still considered a top-tier product by many experts and users alike.</p>
      <p>Razer's bright green <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Razer-Kraken-Tournament-Headset-Controller/dp/B07G4KD8WW?SubscriptionId=AKIAIR4HVRUPV72R52YQ&amp;tag=gamec01c-21&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953">Kraken Tournament Headset</a> is also generally slipping in price, but we're not convinced it'll get much cheaper than £61.99 any time soon – in fact, it has a habit of leaping back up to at least £85 for sustained periods.</p>
      <p>The real decent savings are in the mechanical keyboards. Almost all of Corsair's keyboard offerings in this Black Friday sale are considerably below the average recent price on Amazon UK, and it's unlikely that other retailers will be able to offer them much cheaper. One of the highest rated on Amazon is the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Corsair-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Switches/dp/B07DNTNK7F?SubscriptionId=AKIAIR4HVRUPV72R52YQ&amp;tag=gamec01c-21&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953">Corsair K70 MK.2</a> – make sure you head to this link, as for some reason there's two distinct products on Amazon UK, and the other is only down to £100.99; you can save an extra £6 with the above link. Our friends at <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/corsair-k70-rgb-mk2-review-performance">PCGamesN</a> considered it to be a decent but overly safe upgrade to Razer's existing range considering the price – now it's over £50 off, it seems like a particularly good place to start for the budding PC gamer. Corsair aren't the only ones bringing mechanical keyboards to the Black Friday sale – the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Razer-Keyboard-Backlight-Ergonomic-UK-Layout/dp/B01MSN30VB">Razer Ornata Chroma Gaming Keyboard</a> is 42% off RRP at £58.49, a price it hasn't dropped to since last Black Friday. The <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/HyperX-HX-KB2RD2-UK-R1-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07929D1HF">HyperX Alloy Elite RGB Mechanical Gaming Keyboard</a> has very strong customer reviews too, and is considerably discounted at £62.50 – that's well over half off the original price, and it has only dropped to £80 or so in the past.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Controller-customizable/dp/B06W2KLM3S?SubscriptionId=AKIAIR4HVRUPV72R52YQ&amp;tag=gamec01c-21&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953">Elgato Stream Deck</a> is still widely considered to be one of the best streaming devices out there, if it wasn't for the hefty price. It's still not hugely cheap at £89.99, but we're not sure it's going to dip much lower than that until Elgato come up with a significant new evolution of the range, or a competitor steps up to provide the same intuitive and comprehensive usefulness. Just bear in mind that this is really just for streaming – if you want to capture PC gaming in general, you're likely better off with the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Elgato-Game-Capture-HD60-Pro/dp/B014MQIVPS?SubscriptionId=AKIAIR4HVRUPV72R52YQ&amp;tag=gamec01c-21&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953">Elgato Game Capture HD60 Pro</a> at £119.99 – it hasn't been quite that cheap since 2017. If you want to complete your set-up, you could plump for the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Corsair-Elgato-professional-adjustable-app-enabled/dp/B07L755X9G?SubscriptionId=AKIAIR4HVRUPV72R52YQ&amp;tag=gamec01c-21&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953">Elgato Professional Studio LED panel</a> to professionally control the light on your stressed-out gaming face. However £139.99 is a lot to invest in a light if you are just starting out – you could start with something much cheaper like the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07QN38V1K?SubscriptionId=AKIAIR4HVRUPV72R52YQ&amp;tag=gamec01c-21&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953">Zomei LED Ring Light</a>, currently at £23.79 – which from personal experience does enough to make you look awake on cam, and can easily be used for some elegant portrait work on your smartphone too.</p>
      <p>That last one isn't in the Daily Deal, but the rest of the above discounts are – <b>these discounts will disappear at midnight tonight</b>. So, if you're in the UK and looking to accessorize your PC gaming and streaming setup, we suggest you go and take a look.</p>
