      <p>United States-based Kenyan singer J.S Ondara has been nominated for the 62nd Grammy Awards scheduled for January 26, 2019.</p>
      <p>Ondara’s debut album Tales of America was nominated under the best Africana Album category.</p>
      <p>The album has a total of 11 songs based on the life of an immigrant in America.</p>
      <p>The annual awarding ceremony will take place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, with musician Alicia Keys as host.</p>
      <p>This year, the 27-year-old lad was also nominated for Best Emerging Act at the 2019 Americana Music Honors and Awards that went down on September 11.</p>
      <p>Ondara moved to the US in 2013  to pursue music after he won a Green Card lottery.</p>

      <p>In a past interview with an American publication, Ondara narrated that his interest in music was sparked when he was walking through a local street market in Nairobi when he encountered a tune that changed his life.</p>
      <p>According to him, the magic tune was “Forget Her” by Jeff Buckley, the mythic ‘90s alt-rock hero who was lauded for his vocal and songwriting ability before his death in 1997.</p>
      <p>Lack of equipment due to his humble background, he said, derailed his journey to stardom.</p>
      <p>Things, however, changed upon landing in the US as he bought himself a guitar and practised to play and sing along the poems he had written.</p>

      <p>It didn’t take long before local radio played his music and covers which then lad to larger bookings and ultimately a record deal with California-based Verve Records.</p>
      <p>Over the last few months, Ondara has played sold-out gigs across the U.S. and Europe.</p>
      <p>In February Ondara was named among the Emerging Artists Spotlight, a new Billboard series where a musician is highlighted for their recent debut that has made it on the Emerging Artists Chart.</p>
      <p>Back in January, Billboard named Kenya-born, Minneapolis-based J.S. Ondara as one of the alternative/indie artists to watch this year.</p>
