      <h4>TravelPerk’s first-of-its-kind service, FlexiPerk gives companies and travelers unprecedented flexibility by making any booking (flight, hotel, car, train) refundable, no matter the fare.</h4>
      <p>LONDON - <b>TravelPerk</b> announces that <b>FlexiPerk</b>, a ground-breaking new product that gives business travelers unprecedented flexibility to cancel and get a refund on any booking for any reason, is now available to customers in the US, UK, Germany, and Spain.  </p>
      <p>Since FlexiPerk’s Beta launch was announced, over 300 companies have applied to use the service. Over the past four months, FlexiPerk was successfully used by a number of these companies, saving them tens of thousands of euros compared to what they would have spent on more expensive flexible fares and cancellation fees. For instance, Sumup, the London and Berlin-based mobile payments company, managed to save over 60%. </p>
      <p>FlexiPerk is a major step for business travel, which for decades has been unnecessarily expensive and painful for both traveler and company. </p>
      <p>Historically, businesses that want to make changes to trips have been forced to choose between expensive “<i>flexi-fares</i>” offered by corporate travel providers (on average 60% more than standard fares), or time-consuming refund processes. FlexiPerk solves that problem by automatically making every booking refundable, at a fraction of the cost. With a service fee of just 10% per trip, companies gain the flexibility to cancel and a guaranteed refund of at least 90% on any booking.</p>
      <p>FlexiPerk is the only product of its kind in the corporate travel market, giving business travelers absolute freedom while delivering significant savings for businesses. There’s now no need to read through complex refund policies or spend hours on the phone with customer support, with one click, TravelPerk will cancel the booking and process the refund no questions asked.</p>
      <p><b>Matabato Kimani</b>, Head of Operations at London-based Sumup, said: “<i>At SumUp, our team has grown incredibly quickly and we now have 15 offices across 3 continents. This means that our team is travelling more than ever, often long-haul flights and at short notice due to changing business needs. Using TravelPerk’s FlexiPerk has meant that we can focus on continued innovation in the financial space, rather than worrying about the cost of changing our travel plans. We’ve worked closely with TravelPerk to make sure this was good for not just our peace of mind, but also our bottom line. And we’re delighted to have saved about 60% of what we would have otherwise spent on more expensive fares and cancelation fees</i>.”</p>
      <p><b>Avi Meir</b>, CEO and Co-Founder of TravelPerk, added: “<i>I said when FlexiPerk went into beta that it was the biggest development in the business travel industry in more than a decade, and what we’ve seen from customers like Sumup has confirmed that. We’ve helped companies save hundreds of thousands of euros already. But more importantly, customers say that they now have more peace of mind when booking travel. This company was founded on the principle of providing a better experience for the traveller. FlexiPerk does that by not only improving travel for the individual on the go, but also making it a more attractive proposition to the company. I’m so excited to role this out to customers around the globe, starting today</i>.”</p>
