      <p>Madhuri gave a tribute to Saroj Khan during her IIFA 2019 performance,  who has choreographed Madhuri for some of her most loved songs like Tamma Tamma, Channe K Khet Mein, Dhak Dhak Karne Laga, and Maar Dala among many more.</p>
      <p>Born as Nirmala Nagpal in Mumbai to a couple migrated to India after partition, Saroj Khan started as a child actor in the industry. She learned dancing on the sets from noted choreographer and Kathak guru B Sohanlal.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Madhuri Dixit was last seen in Karan Johar’s magnum opus <i>Kalank</i>. Though the film boast of an impressive ensemble of Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan, Sanjay Dutt, and Aditya Roy Kapur, the film failed to impress the masses and was also a box office dud!</p>
