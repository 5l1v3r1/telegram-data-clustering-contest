      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1197868894838345728?s=20">Since about 7:30 a.m. EST</a>, both the original <i>Destiny</i> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/6/18655373/destiny-2-google-stadia-cross-save-transfer-xbox-one-pc"><i>Destiny 2</i></a><i> </i>players are unable to log into the games. Upon sign-in, a stork error code greets players, as well as a message indicating the servers are down.</p>
      <p>On Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1197886576333733888?s=20">Bungie says it’s investigating</a> the issue. Via its Bungie Help account, the studio thanks players for their patience, and asks them to standby while the developers find a fix.</p>
      <p>This downtime is unusual for a Friday morning in Destiny — or any day without a major content update. As usual, Bungie will continue to update players with any breaking updates on the game’s stability via the Bungie Help Twitter account.</p>

      <p>It’s unclear if this server downtime could have anything to do with the launch of <i>Destiny 2 </i>on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/11/18/20967328/google-stadia-review-games-guide-destiny-2">Google Stadia earlier this week</a>. Prior to release, Stadia offered the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/6/18655373/destiny-2-google-stadia-cross-save-transfer-xbox-one-pc">complete <i>Destiny 2</i> collection</a> — including the game and all of its expansions — for pre-ordering the founder’s edition of the new service.</p>
      <p><b>Update (4:15 p.m. EST)</b>: Players are now able to log in to <i>Destiny 2</i>. However, Bungie tweeted that server maintenance is still ongoing, and that players will likely still run into server issues (especially the weasel error).</p>
      <p>In our own experience, we could land on a planet for a few minutes before the game booted us out to the login page again.</p>
