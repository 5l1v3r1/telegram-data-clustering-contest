      <p>You’ve probably heard of Disneyland Paris. You’re probably also aware of St. David’s Day. But did you know that, every year, Disneyland Paris hosts a Welsh weekend?</p>
      <p>Since 2007, the festival celebrates Wales’ patron saint with an exciting Disney twist. Everywhere you turn the park is flooded with Welsh accents and the coach park filled with Welsh companies.</p>
      <p>The 2020 festival is set to take place from March 6 to 8 and promises to be a truly unique experience for all visitors, especially families.</p>
      <p>Looking for the lowdown? Read on…</p>
      <h3>Witness dazzling performances</h3>
      <p>Disney is famous for its incredible performances and the St. David’s Welsh weekend is no different.</p>
      <p>On the afternoon of Saturday, March 7, watch as multiple talented dancers take to the stage in the Videopolis Theatre wearing traditional Welsh dress to open the dazzling live performances.</p>
      <p>The main show will invite school choirs from across Wales to perform, and also see the winners from the Urdd Welsh National Eisteddfod perform on the international stage.</p>
      <p>Mickey and Minnie will also make an appearance, dressed in Welsh themed costumes, and, at this year's festival back in March, the winners of BBC talent show Last Choir Standing, Only Men Aloud, performed live at the festival.</p>

      <h3>Enjoy an epic fireworks show</h3>
      <p>Arguably the highlight of the experience is the Disneyland's Illuminations show which takes place over Sleeping Beauty’s castle every night just before the park closes.</p>
      <p>Watch thousands of people gather as the sky turns red and Welsh dragons are projected on to the castle, highlighted by the incredible fireworks.</p>
      <p>The spectacle is sound-tracked by all your favourite Disney songs, so, for those of you who have spent years learning the lyrics, make sure to sing along!</p>
      <h3>Experience the land of song</h3>
      <p>Of course, Wales has a very long history of fantastic music, which Disneyland Paris makes sure to showcase throughout the festival.</p>
      <p>Bands reminiscent of the Stereophonics and Manic Street Preachers will perform in Billy Bob’s Country Western Saloon, making you feel like you’re on a proper Welsh night out - just grab some chips on the way back to the hotel to top it off!</p>

      <h3>Enjoy the extra Welsh touches</h3>
      <p>However, it’s not just the big set pieces that make this festival so special; it’s the little touches that are dotted throughout.</p>
      <p>Spot Mickey and Minnie Mouse in traditional Welsh dress, daffodil information boards, face painting reminiscent of a rugby match day in Cardiff, and, of course, there’ll be plenty of Welsh flags to spot!</p>
      <h3>Top tip</h3>
      <p>When you book with Edwards Coaches, not only is your travel and entry covered for the weekend, but you can also make use of Disney’s Magic Hours.</p>
      <p>This means that you can get access to the parks a whole hour earlier than the general public, avoid crowds on the big rides, and have more time to soak up the magical atmosphere.</p>
