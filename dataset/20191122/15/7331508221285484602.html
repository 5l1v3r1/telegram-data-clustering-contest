      <h1>Veteran backup Josh Johnson among three QBs signed by XFL</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:15:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author">Kevin Seifert</a></address>
      <p>Veteran NFL backup <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/11394/josh-johnson">Josh Johnson</a> was among three quarterbacks signed by the XFL on Friday ahead of a supplemental round to its inaugural draft, raising the total of league-distributed quarterbacks to 11.</p>
      <p>Johnson, who started three games for the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/wsh/washington-redskins">Washington Redskins</a> in 2018, will join the Los Angeles Wildcats. He also played for the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns">Cleveland Browns</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-buccaneers">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> -- going 1-7 in eight career starts -- since he was drafted in 2008.</p>
      <p>The other quarterbacks signed by the XFL on Friday were <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/2565969/taylor-heinicke">Taylor Heinicke</a>, an NFL backup for parts of four seasons who will join the St. Louis BattleHawks, and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/3931782/type/college">Chase Litton</a>, who has spent parts of the past two seasons on NFL practice squads and will join the Seattle Dragons.</p>
      <p>Most XFL players will be selected by teams through the draft, but the league is assigning its top-level quarterbacks to ensure parity. Its previous distribution included <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/15904/landry-jones">Landry Jones</a> (Dallas Renegades), <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/2976299/cardale-jones">Cardale Jones</a> (DC Defenders) and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/16593/matt-mcgloin">Matt McGloin</a> (New York Guardians).</p>
      <p>If they hit all available bonuses, some XFL quarterbacks' compensation could approach $500,000. The average XFL quarterback is likely to earn about $125,000, including base salaries and bonuses. The standard base salary for players at other positions will be $27,000 per year, but the average non-quarterback is likely to push his compensation to $55,000 through bonuses.</p>
      <p>Friday's supplemental draft will allow each team to push its roster to 70 players in preparation for minicamps next month. A total of 561 players were selected in the XFL's October draft, but since then, at least one player -- defensive end <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/3044733/type/college">Corey Vereen</a> -- <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/27920957/xfl-draftee-corey-vereen-play-low-pay">has backed out</a> because of the league's pay scale. A handful of other draft picks have since signed with NFL practice squads.</p>
      <p>Players who sign contracts to participate in minicamp will agree not to return to the NFL for the remaining weeks of the season.</p>
      <p>The XFL announced this week that all eight teams will conduct training camp in the Houston area for three weeks in January. The XFL's first weekend of games is Feb. 8-9, 2020.</p>
