      <p>The Michael Jackson Estate is banking on the belief that the late pop superstar has emerged relatively unscathed from this year’s renewed focus on allegations of serial pedophilia via HBO’s <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2032688/michael-jackson-documentary-hbo-leaving-neverland-trailer/video/"><i>Leaving Neverland</i></a> documentary. Not only is the self-proclaimed King Of Pop getting a <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2061035/michael-jackson-broadway-play-mj-the-musical/news/">biographical jukebox musical</a> next year — just yesterday we learned he’d be portrayed on stage by <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2065683/ephraim-sykes-will-star-as-michael-jackson-on-broadway/news/">Ephraim Sykes</a> — now comes news that a scripted motion picture is on the way too, helmed by one of the producers of the <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2029789/queens-brian-may-apologizes-for-defending-bryan-singer-after-new-allegations/news/">fraught</a> but <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2026240/bohemian-rhapsody-highest-grossing-musician-biopic/news/">massively</a> <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2027499/bohemian-rhapsody-golden-globes-best-picture/news/">popular</a> Queen biopic <i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i>.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/michael-jackson-movie-bohemian-rhapsody-producer-john-logan-graham-king-1202792922/">Deadline</a> reports, Jackson’s estate has sold the rights for his life story to producer Graham King, who helmed <i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i> and also has <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2063557/bee-gees-biopic-film-announcement/news/">a Bee Gees biopic</a> in the works. Don’t stop ’til you get enough, Graham!</p>
      <p>King’s production company GK Films has retained screenwriter John Logan, whose previous collaborations with King include <i>The Aviator</i>, Martin Scorsese’s Howard Hughes biopic starring Leonardo DiCaprio. King and Logan will reportedly write the script before shopping the project to studios.</p>
      <p>According to Deadline, the movie “isn’t intended to be a sanitized rendering of Jackson’s life.” Furthermore, “the complexity of Jackson’s life is well known and will not be ignored in a film that will span his entire life, which ended with <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/76262/michael_jackson_dies_of_heart_attack/news/">his tragic death in June 2009</a> at age 50.” But will they leave in the part where Jackson took a young boy <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2035540/surveillance-video-from-1989-confirms-michael-jackson-took-james-safechuck-jewelry-shopping/news/">shopping for an engagement ring</a>?</p>
