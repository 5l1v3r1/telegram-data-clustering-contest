      <p>Gaming is something a lot of people do on smartphones. After all, if you’re into gaming, there’s nothing better than having a “console” in your pocket at all times. Not all phones are great at playing some of the more resource-intensive games, however, and not everyone can afford the most specced out devices. So we try to eke out as much as we can from what we have. L Speed is a <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk">Magisk</a> module that aims to do exactly that.</p>
      <p>From the developer’s description:</p>
      <p>
        <i>L Speed is a modification that combines tweaks inside an intuitive module, Its goal is to improve overall performance, reduce significant lags, extend battery life and improve your gaming experience on Android. The mod will and should work on any device that meets its minimum requirement. You only need a rooted Android device to function properly.</i>
