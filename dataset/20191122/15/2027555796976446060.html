      <p>Chinese smartphone maker launched the new U20, the successor of the budget mobile U10 series in India.</p>
      <p>The highlight feature of the Vivo U20 is the photography hardware. It boasts an Artificial Intelligence-powered triple camera-- primary 16MP (with Sony IMX499 sensor), super ultra-wide-angle 8MP and a 2MP (for macro shots). It can automatically detect the type of environments such as landscape, hillside, flowers, beach, and other scenarios and optimise the camera hardware to get the best photos in any lighting conditions. It also has a night mode, which brightens the subject with near-natural colour even under pitch darkness. It also comes with  AI Super Wide Angle, Super Macro, Bokeh with Shot-Refocus and much more.</p>
      <p>On the front, it houses an equally impressive 16MP selfie camera and with AI Face Beauty, AR Stickers feature, so users can adjust skin and do photo editing to make the images look photogenic or funny worth sharing on social media platforms.</p>

      <p>Another notable aspect is the battery capacity. It comes with 5,000mAh cell and if the company is to be believed, consumers play YouTube videos continuously for 11 hours in a single full charge. It can last for 243 hours under standby mode. It also supports 18W fast charging.</p>
