      <p>Given what <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2019/11/tesla-unveils-cybertruck-in-la-39900-of-absolute-madness/">Tesla revealed last night</a>, it seemed appropriate to reference a movie from the early ’80s — an era from which the automaker’s “futuristic” Cybertruck appears to have emerged. Looking like a stainless steel pup tent with a delicatessen counter serving as a dash, the Cybertruck’s Thursday night reveal generated a critical mass of hot takes, resulting in an megaton-level explosion of ridicule heard to the farthest reaches of space.</p>
      <p>Perhaps even on Mars.</p>
      <p>While the term “half baked” appeared to be one of the more popular descriptors for the vehicle (and may be a contributing factor to the vehicle’s design), market analysts are a sober-minded crowd. Friday morning, they let loose.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/wall-street-on-teslas-new-pickup-cybertruck-looks-weird.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;par=sharebar">CNBC</a></i> has a good rundown of Wall Street’s reaction.</p>
      <p>“In a night to be remembered for the Armored Glass fail, Tesla’s Cybertruck reveal will likely disappoint current pickup truck owners and we see the vehicle remaining a niche and not a mainstream product,” wrote Jeffrey Osborne in a note to investors, adding that the entry-level $39,900 version was, like the much-touted $35k Model 3, unlikely to ever see the light of day. The vehicle’s glaring lack of side mirrors and windshield wipers is evidence of a rushed launch, he said.</p>
      <p>No mention was made of the tacky seam (weld?) at the apex of the Cybertruck’s triangle.</p>
      <p>Emmanuel Rosner of Deutsche Bank wondered whether the pyramid-shaped vehicle was too polarizing, writing “what are the real battery ranges under working conditions, with a payload or while towing? A greatly reduced range would require commercial customers to opt for the higher trims, which could be significantly more expensive than their equivalent traditional pickups.”</p>
      <p>He added that having the truck’s supposedly armoured window glass shatter during the reveal was “not a good start.”</p>

      <p>Like many others, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi saw the makings of a niche vehicle in Cybertruck, rather than a serious challenger to high-volume offerings like the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500.</p>
      <p>“We suspect Cybertruck will not materially impact Tesla’s financials, or investor sentiment, though its aggressive price raises the question of how healthy gross margins might be,” Sacconaghi wrote.</p>
      <p>After gazing at the creation before him, Credit Suisse’s Dan Levy claimed the Model 3 and Model Y will be the company’s breadwinners for the foreseeable future. “We expect Cybertruck to be a lifestyle vehicle; but amid a highly radical design (unlike anything the industry has seen), it’s unclear to us who the core buyer will be,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>Jed Dorsheimer of Canaccord Genuity was more bullish on the Cybertruck, claiming the introduction gives Tesla a presence in a segment previously reserved for other players. “The starting price point of $39,900 for the 250-mile-range, single-motor RWD design option was also a strong point as this positions the Cybertruck competitively in the middle of the lucrative truck market,” he wrote. Still, Dorsheimer admitted the design was “polarizing.”</p>
      <p>There’s nothing wrong with wild, polarizing styling, as such things keep the world a vibrant and exciting place. But Tesla’s creation inspired more questions than answers. Where will it be built? How is this model going to get off the ground a year after the Model Y, a vehicle whose production is also peppered with questions of capacity? Is rear-seat headroom all that hot? Can the design stay as-is in a world that demands stringent pedestrian safety standards?</p>
      <p>We await the answers.</p>
      <p>Tesla’s stock sank 5.7 percent in early Friday trading.</p>
