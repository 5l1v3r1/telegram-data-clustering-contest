      <p>The San Francisco Comedy Festival is going to break in the new decade with some laughs from Jan. 9-26, 2020. Comedians will be performing in venues across the city in events ranging from live performances, discussions, panels, improv, immersive comedy experiences and more.</p>
      <p>The lineup is billed as Sketchfest’s most eclectic yet, and will showcase the Bay Area premiere of “Freestyle Love Supreme,” the Broadway improvised hip-hop extravaganza created by Thomas Kail, <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Lin-Manuel+Miranda">Lin-Manuel Miranda</a> and Anthony Veneziale. The one-of-a-kind comedy ride is based on audience suggestions, ensuring a unique and vibrant show.</p>
      <p>Tributes will be made to a number of comedians and films, as well. 1985 was a huge year for comic movies, as many are celebrating landmark anniversaries in 2020, including <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/The+Rocky+Horror+Picture+Show">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a></i> and <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2012/11/the-10-best-movies-airplane-movies.html"><i>Airplane!</i></a>.
