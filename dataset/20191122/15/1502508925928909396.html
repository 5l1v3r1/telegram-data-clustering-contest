      <p>The ED on Friday gave its consent in a court here for disposal of two airplanes and a yacht belonging to HDIL group firms owned by Rakesh Wadhawan and his son Sarang, prime accused in the Rs 4,355 crore Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank scam.</p>
      <p>The Enforcement Directorate, which is probing the scam along with the Mumbai police's Economic Offences Wing, has attached movable properties worth Rs 3,830 crore, which comprise luxury cars, a seven-seater speedboat, two aircraft and a yacht belonging to HDIL and its promoters.</p>
      <p>The RBI appointed administrator for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pmc-bank">PMC Bank </a>had moved the metropolitan court here seeking its direction to sell movable assets attached by probe agencies.</p>
      <p>The EOW has already given its consent to dispose of these properties earlier.</p>
      <p>The ED, in it's reply filed through its counsel Kavita Patil, said it had no objection for disposal of two airplanes and a yacht by the PMC administrator.</p>
      <p>However, with regards to sale of other seized items, the ED said application will have to made before adjudicating authorities as per provisions of PMLA Act, it said.</p>
      <p>Chief Metropolitan Magistrate RK Rajebhosale is likely to pass an order on Monday.</p>
      <p>The plea of the PMC administrator, filed through advocate Ramesh Dube-Patil, had submitted that mortgaged and hypothecated assets of the accused are inadequate to satisfy the loan along with due interest.</p>
      <p>Hence it would be in the "interest of justice" to allow the the administrator to dispose of attached movable assets, the application said.</p>
      <p>The accused have also requested to dispose of the movable assets through their letter dated October 16, 2019, the administrator's application added.</p>
      <p>So far, nine persons have been arrested in connection with the alleged Rs 4,355-crore scam including three top bank officials and two promoters of HDIL --Rakesh and Sarang Wadhawan, and auditors.</p>
      <p>The EOW had registered a case accusing the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pmc-bank">PMC bank </a>management of colluding with the Wadhawans to conceal the scrutiny of loan defaults by HDIL from banking regulators.</p>
      <p>The ED case of money laundering was based on the FIR registered by the EOW.</p>
