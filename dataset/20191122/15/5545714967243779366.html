      <p>The PS4 version of <i>Gris </i>isn't a simple port <i>â€“ </i>the developers put in <i>work</i>.</p>
      <p>"The art team revamped over five thousand unique assets to 2x - 4x higher resolution to take advantage of the PS4 Pro and 4K displays," said programmer Roger Mendoza. "Similarly, the majestic score from <a href="https://berlinistband.bandcamp.com/album/gris-original-soundtrack">Berlinist</a> was integrated into the game with less compression so that the music and audio design all sound cleaner and brighter. Additionally, we added some 'quality of life' improvements and a PlayStation-exclusive secret homage to one of our favorite games and an inspiration for <i>Gris</i>."</p>
      <p>If PlayStation fans can rally around <i>Journey</i>, they can do the same for <i>Gris</i>. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-gris-534591.phtml">Moyse gave it a ten</a>!</p>
      <p>Along with the usual digital release on the PlayStation Store, <i>Gris </i>also has a region-free physical copy <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/neo-frontpage/products/limited-run-313-ps4">available from Limited Run</a>. Pre-orders are open today through December 27, and there's "no limit."</p>
