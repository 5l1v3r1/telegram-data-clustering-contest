      <h1>Steam gets another Xbox exclusive next year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:34:24+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:34</time> by <a rel="author">Oscar Dayus</a></address>

        <b>Microsoft has revealed another Xbox exclusive coming to Steam early next year. <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/state-of-decay-2">State of Decay 2</a>, the zombielicious survival-strategy game, will launch on Steam in “early 2020” – or should that be 2022?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/495420/State_Of_Decay_2/">Steam store description</a> says it will launch on the platform next year, but the official release date field lists the game for release on April 1, <i>2022</i>. Steam’s release date fields are occasionally incorrect, however, and given the duration between now and 2022, it’s likely the first window mentioned, 2020, is the correct one.</p>
      <p>Microsoft and developer Undead Labs describe the Steam version as its “best-ever vision of the zombie apocalypse”. It should be noted, however, that you’ll need a free Xbox Live account to play State of Decay 2, even through Steam.</p>
      <p>The post-apocalyptic game first launched in May 2018 on Xbox One and PC via the Windows Store. It experienced a mixed critical reception, with reviewers praising some of its co-op gameplay and RPG elements, but criticising its performance.</p>
      <p>“State of Decay 2 expands on the innovative original in many of the right places, but performance issues and frustrating design decisions hold the game back,” wrote Harry Shepherd in our <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/state-of-decay-2/state-of-decay-2-pc-review">State of Decay 2 review</a>. “The larger map doesn’t add much, but the game is deeper and more refined. Once the emptiness of the game’s world became apparent, I found that the best stories in State of Decay 2 were the ones I wrote myself.”</p>
