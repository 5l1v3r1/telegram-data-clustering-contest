      <h1>4-Star DL Announces Decommitment From LSU</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:52:30+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>One of the top defensive lineman recruits in the country announced his decommitment on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Four-star defensive tackle Jalen Lee revealed he’s re-opening his recruitment. Lee committed to LSU earlier this summer, but decided to open his recruitment back up heading into the final few months of recruitment.</p>
      <p>Lee issued a simple statement on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“I will be decommitting from LSU and re-opening my recruitment,” the top recruit said on his social media account.</p>

      <p>It’s the first bad news Ed Orgeron and the Tigers have received in several months. LSU is the No. 1 team in the country and has virtually locked up a spot in the SEC title game.</p>
      <p>Even with a loss in the SEC title game, the Tigers have a great chance to make the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>However, their 2020 recruiting class took a significant hit this week. Lee is the No. 14 recruit from the state of Louisiana. He holds offers from several of the nation’s top programs, including Alabama, Florida and Ole Miss.</p>
      <p>The Gators and Rebels have been hot on the recruiting trail for Lee and it looks like they are the favorites to land the top recruit.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest recruiting news.</p>
