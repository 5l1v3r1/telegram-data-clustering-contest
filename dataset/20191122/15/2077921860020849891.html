      <h1>Watch Rick Dalton Dance, Sing and Smoke in Extended Once Upon a Time in Hollywood Scene</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:14:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:14</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Russell  </a></address>
      <p>Quentin Tarantino’s acclaimed latest <i>Once Upon a Time in <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Hollywood">Hollywood</a></i> has hit digital platforms a few days early, and to celebrate, Sony Pictures has put out a new extended scene from the film’s bonus features.</p>
      <p>The scene gives us some more of <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Leonardo+DiCaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>’s washed-up actor character, Rick (fuckin’) Dalton, as he cuts a rug on the 1960s musical variety show <i>Hullabaloo</i>. DiCaprio nails Dalton’s smug sense of superiority, exaggerating his expressions and movements, because surely singing Jim Lowe’s “Green Door” (in a hilariously joyless monotone) on television is beneath the beloved star of <i>Bounty Law</i> ... right? Right?!</p>
      <p>Assuming Sony doesn’t have any more surprises up their sleeves, <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/07/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review.html">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a></i> hits Blu-ray and DVD on Dec. 10. Watch Dalton dance below and revisit a recently released deleted scene from the film <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/10/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-home-release-date.html">here</a>.</p>
