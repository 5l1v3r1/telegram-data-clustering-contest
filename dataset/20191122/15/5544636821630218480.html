      <p>Beneficiaries of the N-Power scheme have threatened to take “decisive actions” over the non-payment of their October 2019 stipend, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>This news medium understands that the beneficiaries of the N-Power scheme have not gotten payment of their October stipend with no explanation given by the government.</p>
      <p>According to one of the N-Power beneficiaries in Ayedaade local government area, Osun State, identified as Adewale, they are being treated unfairly.</p>
      <p>He wondered why it was a difficult task paying beneficiaries of the scheme N30,000 as a monthly stipend.</p>
      <p>“Is it not disheartening for us to be treated like animals by the government we enthroned?” he was quoted by Legit as saying.</p>
      <p>“If the senators can be paid their bogus allowances and salaries as and when due, why is it so difficult to pay graduates a meagre N30,000 monthly? It is nothing but sheer wickedness and heartlessness.”</p>
      <p>This is just as another N-Power beneficiary Abdullahi said: “We, the beneficiaries are to be seriously blamed. We have accepted it as norms and that is why they are treating us like fools.</p>
      <p>“With our huge numbers and social media, we can make the federal government be aware of our displeasure. Many of us have already been illegally disengaged based on flimsy reasons. It is high time we took decisive actions before it is too late.”</p>
      <p>N-Power is a graduate and non-graduate job enhancement scheme introduced in 2016 by President Muhammadu Buhari.</p>
      <p>The objective is to enable them to acquire the requisite skills, knowledge and experience for entrepreneurship and self-sufficiency at the culmination of their tenure on the programme.</p>
      <p>N-Power beneficiaries are then paid N30, 000 (approximately 83 US Dollars) monthly stipend and given devices to aid their learning and skills development.</p>
