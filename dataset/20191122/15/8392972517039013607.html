      <h1>Strictly's Michelle Visage vying for guest role on EastEnders</h1>
      <h2>Kat Slater's long lost American cousin!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:17:13+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:17</time> by <a rel="author">Helen Fear</a></address>
      <p>Michelle Visage may have been voted off <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a>, but it won't be long before she's back on the BBC if she has anything to say about it...</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/fans-go-wild-as-cheryl-side-eyes-michelle-visage-on-rupauls-drag-race-uk/">Rupaul's Drag Race</a> star, 51, has revealed she wants a role on soap <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> - and already knows who she'd play.</p>
      <p>And, actually, we reckon she'd fit right in!</p>

      </p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/">Good Housekeeping</a>, Michelle revealed she was "vying for a guest role" in EastEnders, admitting she preferred the BBC soap to ITV's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a>.</p>
      <p>The reason? She believes she's "Kat Slater's American cousin".</p>
      <p>After revealing her desire in the interview, Kat Slater actress Jessie Wallace has given Michelle her blessing...</p>

      </p>
      <p>When a fan tweeted a short film of Michelle saying she believed she was a long-lost Slater, saying "this needs to happen", Jessie replied saying: "I believe this too!"</p>
      <p>Former EastEnders boss <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/dominic-treadwell-collins-calls-for-womens-world-cup-to-be-moved/">Dominic Treadwell-Collins</a> also got involved, claiming that he had been up for the idea before leaving for pastures new.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: "We discussed it - but then I left! @michellevisage and @JessieWallaceUK together? QUEENS."</p>

      <p>Of course, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/eastenders-boss-kate-oates-on-real-reason-she-put-callum-and-ben-together/">Kate Oates</a> is now in charge of the BBC soap, so it's up to her if Michelle arrives in Albert Square.</p>
      <p>But with both Michelle and Kate being champions of gay rights, we think it's possible!</p>
      <p>Michelle and her dancing partner Giovanni Pernice were <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/strictly-come-dancing-michelle-visage-voted-out-in-week-9/">eliminated from the competition in Blackpool</a>, after their Couple's Choice dance to Madonna's Vogue led to a dance-off alongside Saffron Barker and AJ Pritchard.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile the Slater family have been rather quiet in Albert Square for a while...</p>
      <p>Maybe it's time for a new <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/eastenders-fans-beg-for-slaters-to-be-killed-off-like-the-owen-family/">Slater</a> to liven things up a bit?</p>
