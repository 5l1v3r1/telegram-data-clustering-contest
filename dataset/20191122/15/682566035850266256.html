      <p>Cape Town - <b>Manchester United</b> boss <b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer </b>says he feels no extra pressure with highly-rated <b>Mauricio Pochettino</b> on the market following his shock exit from Tottenham.</p>
      <p>The Old Trafford hierarchy have been long-term admirers of the Argentine, who followed a promising stint at Southampton with an impressive reign in north London that peaked with June's Champions League final.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was sacked this week following a disappointing start to the season, with Solskjaer's predecessor Jose Mourinho swiftly appointed by the north Londoners.</p>
      <p>The United boss welcomed Mourinho's return to the Premier League and said he was unruffled by Pochettino's availability.</p>
      <p>"Sorry to disappoint but it's not going to be about Jose or Mauricio," Solskjaer said at the start of his press conference on Friday.</p>
      <p>"I can start with it's good to have Jose back definitely - especially for you guys, maybe for me because you can talk and write about everything else."</p>
      <p>The Norwegian added: "And for Mauricio, it's always sad when one of your colleagues, a good man, you lose your job before Christmas. It's never nice to see so I just wish him all the best.</p>
      <p>"In football you can never be surprised at anything, or you can't be shocked at anything. For me, I've just got to focus on us."</p>
      <p>Asked if United links to Pochettino brings pressure, Solskjaer added: "No, it doesn't bother me at all. I've got the best job in the world and I am sure if you're in a job or if you're out of a job and you're a manager, you'd want this job.</p>
      <p>"So, it doesn't really matter, whatever happens around it. I've got to focus on my job at Man United, do it as well as we can."</p>
      <p>Solskjaer takes his side to Sheffield United on Sunday following the international break.</p>
      <p>The United boss said Paul Pogba was stepping up his recovery and his injured ankle was out of a cast but the French World Cup winner would still be out "for a few weeks".</p>
