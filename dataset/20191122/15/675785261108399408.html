      <h1>Katie Price completely botches ad on Twitter and unleashes fan's fury</h1>
      <h2>Katie tagged the wrong company when promoting a florist on Twitter and a follower had some harsh words for her in the comments section</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:50:43+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:50</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/katie-price">Katie Price</a> has utterly messed up an ad she was trying to do for a florist.</p>
      <p>The former glamour model, 41, seems to have enraged a fan by tagging the wrong company in her Twitter post.</p>
      <p>Katie posed in her tracksuit bottoms and hoodie on the sofa, admiring a lavishly curated bouquet of flowers.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "#ad | Still receiving these beautiful flowers from @londonblooms. They send a unique selection of gorgeous flowers every week, and you can get started for just Â£11 per your first two boxes using code KATIE50."</p>
      <p>@londonblooms isn't the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> handle of the company she meant, something that someone in the comments picked up on.</p>

      <p>"That's a pretty s**t 'Ad'," they wrote, "Since she's STILL using the Twitter handle of an American jewellery maker.</p>
      <p>"If she gets paid for these tweets then London Blooms should [ask] for their money back."</p>
      <p>In the same ad on Instagram, she got the tag right.</p>
      <p>Katie's no stranger to coming up against adversity online - she's even facing down trolls who've targeted eldest son Harvey.</p>
      <p>In a video she shared with her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> followers, Katie filmed Harvey imploring trolls to stop their online bullying.</p>

      <p>17 year old Harvey, who suffers from Prader-Willi Syndrome, is partially blind and autistic, said: "Please don't be horrible to Harvey."</p>
      <p>Later, his mum prompted: "And what don't you want them to do?"</p>
      <p>"Bully people," Harvey insisted.</p>

      <p>She also took down a cruel troll last month who branded Harvey a "fat s**t" and her a "s**g."</p>
      <p>"If anybody knows this person or works with this person," Katie wrote of the troll, who's profile said she was a health and social care nursing consultant, "I would question her job."</p>
      <p>"This is exactly what she said about my son Harvey," Katie continued, "Name and shame her."</p>
      <p>She was also attacked for her appearance following a radio interview, and for taking a picture of five year old daughter Bunny holding a Louis Vuitton bag.</p>
      <p>She does have many adoring fans though, who often gush over Katie's skills as a parent, particularly in dealing with Harvey's condition.</p>
      <p>"Beautiful picture of mother and son," one fan wrote on a recent throwback snap of Katie and Harvey.</p>
      <p>Another said: "This photo is magical, soooo much love in those faces."</p>
