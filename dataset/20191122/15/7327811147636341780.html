      <p>If you've never been the victim of a porch pirate, it's only a matter of time according to new research.</p>
      <p>A new study conducted by <a href="https://www.crresearch.com/blog/2019-package-theft-statistics-report">C+R Research</a> finds 36 percent of Americans have had packages stolen from their front porch in the past year. That's up from 31 percent in 2017.</p>
      <p>Researchers asked 2000 online shoppers about their experiences with package theft over the past year. More than one-third have been a victim of theft, and 44 percent of those at least twice. Only 11 percent said the porch pirate was caught. Fortunately, 73 percent of the victims said they received a refund.</p>
      <p>The holidays are just around the corner and 92 percent of people surveyed say they plan to shop online this Christmas leading to more packages delivered to front doors.</p>
      <p>Many homeowners are opting to purchase doorbell cameras when it comes to preventing package theft. They say the cameras "provide peace of mind."</p>
