      <h1>School bans girls wearing leggings as they 'distract boys and sexualise girls'</h1>
      <h2>A senior teacher likened leggings to bikinis and called for girls not to wear them to school because they distract boys from working and sexualise girls.</h2>

      <p>A school has banned girls from wearing leggings after likening them to bikinis and saying the clothing item distracts boys from their work.</p>
      <p>A senior teacher at the school - which parents have asked not to be named - posted a message in a student forum comparing the garment to wearing a bikini, <a href="https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/school-life/melbourne-school-bans-girls-from-wearing-leggings-compares-them-to-bikinis/news-story/f4412d680fcacb13725c893c4c8b2001#itm=newscomau%7Clifestyle%7Cright-now-in-%7C2%7CMelbourne%20school%20bans%20leggings%20because%20boys%20can%E2%80%99t%20concentrat...%7Cindex%7CLifestyle%20index&amp;itmt=1574421714202">reports news.com.au</a> .</p>
      <p>Hours later the post was removed but the request has enraged parents.</p>
      <p>The President of the Australian Parents Council Jenni Rickard told Neil Mitchell, a presenter on the radiostation 3AW Mornings, the ban was outdated and “ridiculous”.</p>
      <p>She said: “Can I just check what decade we are in? I thought it was 2019, not the 1980s."</p>

      <p>“Saying that it’s because it distracts the boys is ridiculous, and I would say is not real.”</p>
      <p>Ms Rickard added that if boys can’t concentrate or if the boys see it as suggestive, that is their own problem not the fault of the girl’s clothing.</p>
      <p>Despite the backlash the ban is still in place.</p>
      <p>It is thought to be the first school in Australia to ban leggings. However, others around the world have already made the move.</p>

      <p>A school in Kansas forced an 11-year-old to wear tracksuit bottoms from the the spare clothing box after she arrived at class wearing a pair of leggings and tunic top, <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/3/28/18285843/leggings-controversy-history-notre-dame-tights-not-pants">according to Vox</a> .</p>
      <p>The school nurse told her she was not allowed to call her mother and ask for a change of clothes. Instead she told her she must “go back to class and you have to wear these borrowed pants”.</p>
      <p>A Catholic mother of four sons caused a stir when she wrote a letter to the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, America, complaining about the ‘legging problem’.</p>

      <p>The disgruntled mum wrote of her dismay at seeing college students in leggings en-masse on the campus last autumn.</p>
      <p>She wrote: “I wonder why no one thinks it’s strange that the fashion industry has caused women to voluntarily expose their nether regions in this way.</p>
      <p>“I thought of all the other men around and behind us who couldn’t help but see their behinds.”</p>
      <p>In response to her letter to the editor of the student paper, female students staged a protest that saw around 1,000 gather in leggings, with some of them sharing images on social media.</p>

      <p>In the UK, the ‘anti-legging trend’ has enraged parents after skinny jeans and leggings were prohibited from being worn to school.</p>
      <p>One such school is Witchford Village college in Cambridgeshire that told parents in 2017 they would have to buy the school uniform from the school shop rather than allow their kids to wear tight fitted garments.</p>
      <p>A petition was signed by more than 300 parents with the cost of the school uniform and the issue of ‘cramping youngster’s style’ the main sticking points for the protest, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/parents-fury-new-school-uniform-10948659">The Mirror previously reported.</a></p>
      <p>However, a more recent debate over clothing in the UK has focused on girls wearing skirts to school. At least 40 secondary school across England have banned pupils from wearing skirts.</p>
