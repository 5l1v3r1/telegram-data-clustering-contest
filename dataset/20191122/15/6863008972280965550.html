      <p>The Ukrainian president's permanent envoy for the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, Anton Korinevych, says Ukraine is not considering the use of armed forces to liberate Russia-occupied Crimea.</p>
      <p>According to the official, the Ukrainian government is talking about political and diplomatic solutions in the context of Crimea and Donbas.</p>
      <p>"We understand the occupied territory of Crimea is very militarized by the Russian Federation," Korinevych said in an interview to the online publication <a href="https://lb.ua/news/2019/11/22/442826_anton_korinevich_rosiyska.html">lb.ua</a>.</p>
      <p>He added the representative office of the president of Ukraine was completing an analysis of the number of weapons in Crimea.</p>
      <p>"I think we will soon publish this report and discuss this issue with government agencies and international partners. For example, ships of the [Russian] Black Sea Fleet are equipped with the Kalibr-type ship-launched systems, and the Bal and Bastion coastal missile systems are deployed on the peninsula, and they're also talking about the Iskander [ballistic missile] systems. Let's hope that after presenting this information to international partners, sanctions and pressure will sooner or later give a result," Korinevych added.</p>
