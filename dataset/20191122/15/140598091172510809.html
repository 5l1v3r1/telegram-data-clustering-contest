      <p>You can wilt the spinach first then whizz it in a blender. I add it freshly chopped for texture. </p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>15 minutes | <b>Cooking time: </b>30 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES </h3>
      <p>four </p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
        <li>2 large onions, finely diced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste (grate together 1 part peeled ginger and 2 parts peeled garlic, by volume)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato purée</li>
        <li>600g boneless chicken breasts or thighs, skinned and cubed</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 tsp medium-hot chilli powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>200g fresh spinach, washed and chopped</li>
        <li>Rotis or rice, to serve</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the onions over a high heat for 4-5 minutes until they start to change colour. Reduce the heat and cook for a further 3-4 minutes until they are soft and can be cut easily with the edge of a spoon.</li>
        <li>Add the ginger-garlic paste and fry for 30 seconds, then add the tomato purée and fry for a couple of minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces and fry over a high heat to seal in the juices, then add the ground spices. Season with salt, pour in about 150ml cold water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat, cover and cook for 10 minutes, or until the chicken is tender, and is white and hot all the way through when a piece is cut open.</li>
        <li>Stir in the spinach and bring to the boil again. Adjust the seasoning to taste. Serve hot with rotis or plain boiled rice.</li>
      </ol>
