        <i>• Former England striker won three trophies with club <br/>• ‘My time in Juventus is complete and fulfilled’</i>
      </p>
      <p>The former England striker Eni Aluko is to leave <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus">Juventus</a> at the end of this month, six months earlier than planned. She will return to Britain to consider the next step in her career, having won Serie A, the Coppa Italia and the Supercoppa Italiana in her year and a half there, as well as finishing last season as the club’s top scorer.</p>
      <p>“It’s just a matter of feeling like my time in Juventus is complete and fulfilled,” said the 32-year-old. “On the pitch it’s been a very successful period, winning every trophy that it’s possible to win in Italy, finishing top scorer and appearing in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>“I’m excited to be moving back to London, and back into women’s football in England at a time when there are a lot of exciting opportunities.”</p>

      <p>Aluko has started all but one of Juventus’s six league games this season, scoring one goal and helping them establish a two-point lead at the top of the table. She plans to depart after the home game against Fiorentina, on 30 November.</p>
      <p>“After 18 months and three trophies, @EniAlu has decided to leave Juventus,” the <a href="https://twitter.com/JuventusFCWomen/status/1197892742958989312">club’s Twitter account</a> said . “Thanks for everything, Eni!”</p>
      <p>The only competition she has failed to win while at Juventus was the Champions League, from which they were eliminated at the first hurdle in each of her two seasons, by Brondby in 2018-19 and Barcelona in September.</p>
      <p>“I feel very fortunate to have achieved such success with all of you in my 18 months at the club,” Aluko said in an open letter to Juventus fans. “It has been amazing to share so many good moments with the players working together on the field, laughing, joking, eating together and joking about my Italian.”</p>
