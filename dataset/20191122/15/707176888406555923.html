      <h1>TSB customers suffer payments delays in fresh IT glitch</h1>
      <h2>Problem comes days after report criticised UK bank’s handling of data-transfer fiasco</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:12:17+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:12</time> by <a rel="author">Nicholas Megaw</a></address>
      <p>TSB has come under fire after large numbers of customer payments were delayed just days after a report criticised the bank’s handling of an IT project that ended in disaster.</p>
      <p>The lender encouraged customers to request emergency cash from branches after some were unable to receive salary payments due to be paid into their accounts overnight.</p>
      <p>TSB said the problem had been rectified by late morning on Friday. But it came at a particularly embarrassing time for the bank, which on Tuesday insisted it had recovered and moved on from an IT fiasco that wiped out all its annual profit last year.</p>
      <p>The bank apologised for the “inconvenience” caused by the latest problem. It did not give an estimate of the number of customers who were affected but said it would ensure that no one was left out of pocket.</p>
      <p>A £25m review by the law firm Slaughter and May published this week said the bank missed several opportunities to avoid the meltdown that ensued when it tried to move customer data to a new system in April 2018.</p>
      <p>TSB said the report did not “paint a full picture” of the events, which it blamed mainly on a technical problem in one of its data centres and poor testing by another business owned by its parent company Sabadell. It said it had fixed the issues with the new system and the number of technical incidents so far this year had been below the industry average.</p>
      <p>On Monday TSB, the UK’s seventh-largest bank, will reveal a three-year strategy outlining its plans to move on from its recent problems and return to growth. The plan is expected to entail a number of branch closures and job losses after the new management team — led by chief executive Debbie Crosbie — has repeatedly warned staff that the lender’s cost base is too high.</p>
