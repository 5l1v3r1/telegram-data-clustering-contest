      <p>Republicans and Democrats came together to empower music creators.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Representative Jerrold "Jerry" Nadler (D-NY) co-sponsored a bipartisan bill known as the Ask Musicians For Music Act (AM-FM Act) of 2019. The legislation will modernize existing copyright law by requiring all radio services to pay fair market value for the music they use.</p>
      <p>“When music creators share their wonderful gift with the world, we hear songs that inspire and unite us. We should encourage such thriving talent and ensure the music community is properly compensated for their work,” said Senator Blackburn. “The AM-FM Act will reward singers, songwriters, and musicians for their hard work when their music is played on the radio.”</p>

      <p>The AM-FM Act looks to ensure fair compensation for music creators, end unfair practices harming the music market, and empower copyright owners with new consent rights. Exceptions will be provided for small and noncommercial radio stations.</p>
      <p>“The United States is an outlier in the world for not requiring broadcast radio to pay artists when playing their music, while requiring satellite and internet radio to pay,” said Representative Nadler. “This is unfair to both artists and music providers."</p>
      <p>The Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee continued, "I’m proud to sponsor the Ask Musician For Music Act of 2019 which would give artists and copyright owners the right to make a choice to allow AM/FM radio to use their work for free or to seek compensation for their work. The bill would also allow them to negotiate rates with broadcasters in exchange for permission for it to be aired. This is what music creators want and deserve.”</p>

      <p>The AM-FM Act has garnered support from Chief Industry, Government, &amp; Member Relations Officer of The Recording Academy Daryl P. Friedman, SoundExchange CEO Michael J. Huppe, and National Music Publishers Association President/CEO David Israelite. Mitch Glazier, Chairman/CEO of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), issued a statement regarding the introduction of the Ask Musicians For Music Act.</p>
      <p>“We applaud Chairman Nadler and Senator Blackburn for their leadership in introducing bipartisan, bicameral legislation to ensure creators receive fair market value for their music on all platforms. By requiring broadcasters to get permission from music creators to use their music in the same way broadcasters are entitled to give permission for the use of their signal – the AM/FM Act addresses inequities in law that should be fixed," stated Glazier.</p>
      <p>He added, "Introducing the AM/FM Act on the same day the House Judiciary Committee marked up the Satellite Television Community Protection and Promotion Act of 2019 [the “STCPP Act”] underscores a core principle: both broadcasters and creators deserve the same rights when it comes to the use of their property. The current state of the law granting broadcasters that right while denying it to creators is unjust and skews the market. We look forward to working with Chairman Nadler, Senator Blackburn, and the entire music community to pass this bill.”</p>
