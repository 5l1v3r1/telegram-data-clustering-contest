      <p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A 71-year-old Alaska man is under federal arrest after he was found with $400,000 in illegal drugs hidden in spoiled goat intestines at an airport.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Cenen Placencia of Kodiak was arrested Wednesday at Anchorage’s international airport.</p>
      <p>An affidavit filed with charging documents say investigators with Alaska State Troopers searched a large fish box Placencia had checked as luggage.</p>
      <p>The affidavit says inside was loosely wrapped frozen meat, which was thawed and revealed packages containing about 740 grams of heroin and 389 grams of methamphetamine.</p>
      <p>Troopers say Placencia was in custody at the Anchorage jail.</p>
      <p>Online court records don’t list an attorney for Placencia.</p>
      <p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Christina Sherman says Placencia is scheduled for a Friday afternoon arraignment on a charge of possession with intent to distribute controlled substances.</p>
