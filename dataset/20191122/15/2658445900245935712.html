      <p>“Edo State is an investment and logistics hub. It is also the second-largest state aside Lagos State with the highest trade volume is second-hand vehicles. Our investment priorities include the Benin Enterprise Park, the Automotive Park and Edo Production Center.</p>
      <p>“Edo State is open for investors and businesses and we will continue to improve the ease of doing business. Investors should not be afraid of processes for acquiring land as the government has established the private property protection law that protects individuals and cooperate organization from dubious businessmen.”</p>
