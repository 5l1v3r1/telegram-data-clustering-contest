      <p>LARGO, Fla. (AP) — A Florida man is accused of spitting food into a woman’s mouth following a road rage incident.</p>
      <p>Pinellas County Sheriff’s deputies arrested 61-year-old David Paul Wipperman Thursday on felony battery charges for the incident that took place Oct. 29.</p>
      <p>An arrest report says Wipperman got into a road rage incident with a woman that evening. He got out of his truck and approached the woman’s vehicle. She rolled down her window and apologized to Wipperman.</p>

      <p>The report says Wipperman spit the food he was chewing at her, then opened the door and screamed at her.</p>
      <p>It isn't clear why it took several weeks to arrest Wipperman.</p>
      <p>Wipperman remained in jail Friday morning. Jail records don’t list a lawyer.</p>
