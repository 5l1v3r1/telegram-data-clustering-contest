        <b>Former Irish striker Kevin Doyle believes Mick McCarthy's team will not qualify for next summer's European Championship finals.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Boys in Green <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/sport/wales-win-sets-slovakia-date-ireland-926971"><b>were drawn away</b></a> to Slovakia in the first semi-final of the playoffs and a potential meeting against Northern Ireland awaits in the final if Michael O'Neill's side can see off the Bosnia and Herzegovina challenge in the other semi-final.</p>
      <p>The Wexford man and horse breeder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-gk_Kk82ug"><b>joined Off The Ball's <i>Friday Night Racing</i> </b></a>to speak about his involvement in the Irish horse racing scene.</p>
      <h3>Tough</h3>
      <p>But when it came to football matters, Doyle wasn't so confident when asked about the team's chances of progressing through 'Path C' of the Euro 2020 playoff section.</p>
      <p>"I just saw the draw before I got on to you, and we are away and then away again if we get to the final," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's going to be tough, it's Northern Ireland away and then Bosnia Herzegovina - so, not easy that. I can't see us qualifying if I'm truthful."</p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy's Ireland side <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/sport/player-ratings-ireland-v-denmark-926493"><b>drew 1-1</b> </a>with Denmark. But it wasn't enough to qualify automatically for next summer's event. Aspects of the approach on Monday night pleased Doyle. But he also thinks Ireland could have asserted themselves more rigorously against a "poor" Danish performance.</p>
      <p>"Seanie Maguire came on but came on out wide," he said.</p>
      <p>"He didn't really come on as a centre-forward, did he? I don't know, I just thought we could have gone for it a wee bit more."</p>
      <p>He also discussed his coaching and punditry experiences since retiring as a player.</p>
