      <h1>'Crazy as a bedbug': Trump blasts Pelosi and questions her mental stability</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:00:23+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Dominick Mastrangelo</a></address>
      <p>President Trump renewed his verbal attacks on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, questioning her mental stability and fitness for office.</p>
      <p>"But I have to deal with crazy Nancy, she's crazy as a ... as a bed bug," Trump said during a nearly hourlong interview on <i>Fox &amp; Friends</i> Friday morning. "She is nuts. What she's doing â€” and she's not talented. She's highly overrated. All she's doing is sitting. She's not doing anything for the people. And now it turns out that the whole impeachment thing is a scam."</p>
      <p>Trump was asked by Fox hosts to react to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/public-impeachment-hearings-havent-changed-minds-in-or-out-of-congress">five days of public testimony on Capitol Hill</a> as part of the impeachment investigation into his presidency. Pelosi must now decide if and when to begin formal impeachment proceedings.</p>
      <p>She has said she believes the president has committed impeachable acts, but Democrats would go "where the facts take us."</p>
      <p>The investigation, led by Pelosi and Democratic leadership, centers on a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-white-house-transcript-of-trumps-call-with-ukraines-president">July 25 phone call</a> between Trump and the president of Ukraine during which Trump pressured the foreign leader to investigate a political rival. The call was the climax of what an intelligence agency whistleblower alleged to be a quid pro quo between the United States and Ukraine, using foreign aid as a bargaining chip.</p>
      <p>Several Trump administration officials have <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/diplomats-say-white-house-transcript-of-ukraine-call-was-substantively-correct">acknowledged</a> a quid pro quo between the two world leaders, though none have been able to link the release of aid to domestic political investigations in the U.S.</p>
      <p>"They must think we're nuts in this country," Trump said of people around the world watching this week's internationally-televised hearings. "The Democrats, they look like fools."</p>
      <p>The hearings have been held in the House Intelligence Committee, led by Chairman Adam Schiff, who Trump on Friday called "a sick puppy."</p>
      <p>"He's sick, there's something wrong with him," Trump said.</p>
