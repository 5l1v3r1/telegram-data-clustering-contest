      <h1>Meanwhile, Trump and McConnell Keep Confirming Federal Judges, 'Flipping' Several Circuit Courts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:25:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://townhall.com/author/guybenson" target="_blank">Guy Benson</a></address>
      <p>As the <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2019/11/21/sondland-testimony-n2556821">impeachment drama</a> sucks up all the energy in the House of Representatives and consumes the attention of the political press, Senate Republicans are taking advantage of the legislative process grinding to a halt -- despite Nancy Pelosi's vow that impeachment would not halt progress on other important issues. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the upper chamber's judiciary committee have teed up a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-judges/amid-impeachment-drama-senate-helps-trump-move-u-s-courts-to-the-right-idUSKBN1XU2MZ">nonstop merry-go-round</a> of judicial confirmations, which is spinning ever closer to achieving 'Cocaine Mitch's' <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/juliorosas/2019/11/04/mcconnell-at-trump-rally-my-motto-is-leave-no-judge-vacancy-behind-n2555893">stated goal</a> of filling every single vacancy on the federal bench by the end of President Trump's term. They've been grinding away, making steady, consequential, lasting progress:</p>

      <blockquote>Even as the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday heard crucial testimony from pivotal witness Gordon Sondland, the Senate voted to confirm Trump’s latest appointee to the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a regional appeals court handling cases from Georgia, Alabama and Florida. The action represented a new milestone in Trump’s dramatic reshaping of the federal judiciary, with <b>Republican-appointed judges now in the majority in the 11th Circuit, whose majority before Trump took office in January 2017 had been Democratic appointees. </b>Republican-appointed justices tend to be conservative, while Democratic-named judges tend to be liberal. <b>This marks the third time that Trump has been able to engineer the ideological “flip” of one of the nation’s 13 federal appeals courts, which exert considerable power one level below the U.S. Supreme Court.</b> The other two to “flip” were the Manhattan-based 2nd Circuit and the Philadelphia-based 3th Circuit, both of which also had Democratic-appointed majorities when Trump became president.</blockquote>
      <p>This is outstanding news and a major promise kept to conservative voters -- beyond many of their wildest dreams, I'd wager. One small word of caution. In spite of all the talk of "flipping" courts, the real-world implications aren't quite as simple as that formulation may suggest:</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, the ideological shift that's underway <a href="https://twitter.com/JCNSeverino/status/1197198347335086080">is very real</a>, and extremely important -- via <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2019/07/09/kavanaugh-seven-new-revelations-about-last-years-brutal-confirmation-fight-n2549654">a co-author</a> of "Justice on Trial:"  </p>

      <p>And McConnell <a href="https://twitter.com/davidpopp/status/1197534276385943553">isn't finished yet</a>.  With the media in a lather over Ukraine, he's quietly going about his business:</p>

      <p>Ah yes, so vote for her so she can help Trump by joining the caucus of...Chuck Schumer. <i>Sure, Jan.</i></p>
