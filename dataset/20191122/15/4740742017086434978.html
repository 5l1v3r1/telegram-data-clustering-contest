      <h1>David Prutton reveals latest Championship predictions with Bristol City, West Brom and Leeds United in action</h1>
      <h2>The Championship is back for matchday 17 after a two-week absence</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:44:50+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:44</time> by <a rel="author">Elliott Jackson</a></address>
      <p>The Championship returns for matchday 17 after the end of another international break.</p>
      <p>The league will now have a run of four months uninterrupted as managers prepare their squads for the hectic Christmas period which is just around the corner.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/korey-smith-involved-jack-hunt-3561951">Championship action returns</a> on Friday night with Fulham and Queens Park Rangers going head to head at Craven Cottage in a west London derby.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, league leaders West Brom host Sheffield Wednesday, whilst Leeds United travel to Luton Town.</p>
      <p>Second-place Preston North End travel to Derby County, who have impressed at home despite their mid-table position.</p>
      <p>There's a basement battle at Bet365 Stadium as Michael O'Neill bids to make it two wins from two as Stoke City manager against travel-sick Wigan Athletic.</p>
      <p>Out-of-form Blackburn Rovers host bottom club Barnsley, now under the stewardship of Gerhard Struber, whilst Middlesbrough host Hull City on Sunday.</p>
      <p>With all that in mind, Sky Sports' EFL expert David Prutton is back with his <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/championship-injuries-suspensions-bristol-city-3561590">latest set of Championship predictions.</a></p>
      <p>
        <b>Fulham vs Queen Park Rangers</b>
      </p>
      <p>"How will Fulham get on without Aleksandar Mitrovic? He has been so, so important to them since he arrived at the club and his suspension is a huge blow for this west London derby.</p>
      <p>"QPR have hit the buffers in recent weeks, and are without a win in four. Maybe the international break will have given them a chance to recharge their batteries and they can grab a draw."</p>
      <p>Prutton predicts: 2-2</p>
      <p>
        <b>Charlton Athletic vs Cardiff City</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Charlton are another side who will feel the international break came at the right time after a slump in their form lately. Twenty-two points from their first 16 games is still a fantastic return, though, considering their pre-season expectations.</p>
      <p>"This is a wonderful opportunity for Neil Harris, who takes charge of his first Cardiff game. It will be interesting to see how he tries to deviate from Neil Warnock's style of play early on as the squad has very much been shaped in his image. I'll back a bit of new manager bounce and an away win."</p>
      <p>Prutton predicts: 0-1</p>
      <p>
        <b>Derby County vs Preston North End</b>
      </p>
      <p>Inconsistency is plaguing Derby's season, and they will have had two weeks to dwell on that defeat to bitter rivals Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>Preston proved they can win away at Charlton at the start of November and this is another chance for them to lay down a marker. I think they will do just that.</p>
      <p>Prutton predicts: 0-2</p>
      <p>
        <b>Luton Town vs Leeds United</b>
      </p>
      <p>"It was never going to be easy for Luton on their return to the Championship after such a long time away, but four defeats on the spin has left them in real jeopardy of dropping into the bottom three.</p>

        <figcaption>Prutton predicts a win for Bielsa's Leeds</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"Leeds returned to form before the international break and will fancy their chances of making it three wins in a row. I can't see past an away win."</p>
      <p>Prutton predicts: 0-2</p>
      <p>
        <b>West Brom vs Sheffield Wednesday</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Can anyone stop West Brom? They look like they have got the quality to really charge to promotion this season, especially with Slaven Bilic at the helm.</p>
      <p>"Sheffield Wednesday have now got a potential points deduction looming over them, and it must feel like Deja Vu for Garry Monk. Home win for me."</p>
      <p>Prutton predicts: 2-1</p>
      <p>
        <b>Middlesbrough vs Hull City</b>
      </p>
      <p>"It really couldn't have gone much worse for Jonathan Woodgate so far. They have picked up just two wins all season and find themselves in the relegation zone heading into Sunday's game.</p>
      <p>"Hull on their day can give anyone a game in this league, and with Jarrod Bowen and Kamil Grosicki they could carve through Boro at the Riverside."</p>
      <p>Prutton predicts: 0-2</p>
      <p>
        <b>Remaining Championship predictions:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Blackburn vs Barnsley: 0-1</p>
      <p>Brentford vs Reading: 2-1</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/scouting-report-bristol-citys-key-3565786">Bristol City</a></b> vs Nottingham Forest: 1-2</p>
