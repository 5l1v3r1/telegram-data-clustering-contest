          <b>Most Attractive Stocks Feature for November: Zumiez Inc.</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Zumiez Inc. (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZUMZ">ZUMZ</a>) is the featured stock from November’s Most Attractive Stocks Model Portfolio.</p>
      <p>Since 2017, ZUMZ’s revenue has grown by 8% compounded annually and after-tax profit ((<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/1014071-nopat-definition-and-formulae-for-net-operating-profit-after-tax-and-nopat-margin">NOPAT</a>)) has grown by 21% compounded annually. ZUMZ’s trailing twelve month NOPAT is up 21% over the prior TTM period as well. NOPAT margin has improved from 4.5% in 2017 to 5.9% TTM while its return on invested capital ((<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/1018641-roic-definition-and-formulae-for-return-on-invested-capital">ROIC</a>)) improved from 6% to 9% over the same time.</p>

          <b>ZUMZ Valuation Offers Upside Potential</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>At its current price of $30/share, ZUMZ has a price-to-economic book value ((<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/942151-definition-price-to-ebv-or-price-to-economic-book-value-ratio">PEBV</a>)) ratio of 0.9. This ratio means the market expects ZUMZ’s NOPAT to permanently decline by 10%. This expectation seems overly pessimistic for a firm that has grown NOPAT by 21% since 2017 and 8% compounded annually over the past decade.</p>
      <p>If ZUMZ can maintain its 2019 NOPAT margin (6% - slightly below TTM margin) and grow NOPAT by just 3% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is worth $39/share today – a 30% upside. <a href="https://www.newconstructs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NewConstruct_DCF_ZUMZvaluation_2019-11-14.png">See the math behind this reverse DCF scenario</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>As investors focus more on fundamental research, research automation technology is needed to analyze all the critical financial details in financial filings as shown in the Harvard Business School and MIT Sloan paper,<b> "</b>Core Earnings: New Data and Evidence”.</p>
      <p>Below are specifics on the adjustments we make based on Robo-Analyst findings in Zumiez’s 2019 10-K:</p>
      <p>Income Statement: we made $28 million of adjustments, with a net effect of removing $9 million in non-operating expenses (1% of revenue). You can see all the adjustments made to ZUMZ’s income statement <a href="https://www.newconstructs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NewConstructs_Models_ZUMZ_IncomeStatementAdjustments_2019-11-14.png">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Balance Sheet: we made $473 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of $230 million. One of the largest adjustments was $326 million due to operating leases. This adjustment represented 74% of reported net assets.

      <p>Valuation: we made $468 million of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by $190 million. Apart from total debt, which includes the operating leases noted above, the largest adjustment to shareholder value was $139 million in excess cash. This adjustment represents 18% of ZUMZ’s market cap.

          <b>Most Dangerous Stocks Feature: KVH Industries</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>KVH Industries, (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KVHI">KVHI</a>) is the featured stock from November’s Most Dangerous Stocks Model Portfolio.</p>
      <p>KVHI’s NOPAT has declined from $5 million in 2013 to -$13 million TTM, per Figure 2. NOPAT margin has fallen from 3% in 2013 to -8% TTM while ROIC fell from 4% to -6% over the same time.</p>

          <b>KVHI Provides Poor Risk/Reward</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite its deteriorating fundamentals, KVHI is still priced for significant profit growth.</p>
      <p>To justify its current price of $10/share, KVHI must achieve a NOPAT margin of 3% (last done in 2013, compared to -8% TTM) and grow revenue by 8% compounded annually for the next 12 years. <a href="https://www.newconstructs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NewConstructs_DCF_KVHIjustification_2019-11-14.png">See the math behind this reverse DCF scenario</a>. This expectation seems overly optimistic given that KVHI’s revenue has fallen by 2% compounded annually since 2015 and its margin significantly declined over the past three years.</p>
      <p>Even if we assume KVHI can achieve a 3% NOPAT margin and grow revenue by a more conservative 5% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is worth only $6/share today – a 40% downside. <a href="https://www.newconstructs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NewConstructs_DCF_KVHIvaluation_2019-11-14.png">See the math behind this reverse DCF scenario.</a></p>
