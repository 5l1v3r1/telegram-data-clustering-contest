      <h1>PM Khan mocks Sharif's health; PML-N spokeswoman calls Khan 'mental patient'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:44:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nation.com.pk/NewsSource/web-desk" target="_blank">Web Desk</a></address>
      <p>After Prime Minister Imran Khan raised questions about the health of Nawaz Sharif in a foundation stone ceremony in Mianwali, the Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb lashed out at the prime minister for his "insensitive" comments.</p>
      <p>"The issue here is that the government's performance is zero," she said. "He should have spoken about how the Peshawar BRT cannot be completed even after five years."</p>
      <p>Aurangzeb also suggested that PM Khan be made to get a medical examination, saying that her party was convinced he was a "mental patient".</p>
      <p>In Mianwali, PM Khan had made comments to the effect of questioning the veracity of the medical reports of Nawaz Sharif.</p>
      <p>"After seeing him climb the stairs of the airplane, I once again looked at the medical reports," he said. "The reports said that his heart was also in a bad condition, his kidneys were also not well and he had diabetes. I said to myself 'God is great'," he added sarcastically.</p>
      <p>In a mocking tone, PM Khan said on Nawaz Sharif: "Maybe he looked at the plane and got healed since it was such a magnificent plane. A common man cannot travel in such an aircraft."</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the prime minister was criticized for mimicking the Pakistan People's Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari at the inauguration ceremony of the Hazara motorway.</p>
