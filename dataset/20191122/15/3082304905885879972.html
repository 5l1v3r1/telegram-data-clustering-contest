      <h1>Ederson returns as City look to bounce back against Chelsea</h1>

        <b>Ederson’s absence was keenly felt by Manchester City at Anfield where defeat saw them drop nine points behind Liverpool.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Manchester City will welcome back goalkeeper Ederson for the Premier League visit of Chelsea on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Brazil international suffered a thigh injury during City’s 1-1 Champions League draw at Atalanta earlier this month, ruling him out of the 3-1 defeat at Liverpool where understudy Claudio Bravo deputised.</p>
      <p>The reverse gave Jurgen Klopp’s men a nine-point advantage over City at the Premier League summit and the reigning champions lie fourth, a point and a place behind their weekend opponents.</p>
      <p>Manager Pep Guardiola can therefore be grateful Ederson’s brief but keenly felt absence is at an end.</p>
      <p>Asked whether his number one would be fit at a pre-match news conference, Guardiola replied: “Yep. He trained the last two or three days without pain.”</p>
      <p>The fallout from City’s loss at Anfield extended to a confrontation between Raheem Sterling and Liverpool defender Joe Gomez while on international duty.</p>
      <p>Manager Gareth Southgate elected to stand down Sterling for England’s 7-0 Euro 2020 qualifying win over Montenegro before restoring him to face Kosovo, but Guardiola believes the episode is done and dusted for his star attacker.</p>
      <p>“I spoke with him. He’s fine,” he said.</p>
      <p>“He said Joe is an excellent guy and they have a good relationship.</p>
      <p>“It sometimes happens.”</p>

      <p>Asked whether such a flashpoint mirrored the widely reported hostility between Barcelona and Real Madrid players on international duty during his time in Spain, Guardiola was somewhat sceptical.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think so. [There is] no comparison,” he replied.</p>
      <p>Guardiola must do without Bernardo Silva against Chelsea, after the Football Association imposed a one-match ban and an education course upon the Portugal playmaker for a racially insensitive tweet he sent to team-mate Benjamin Mendy.</p>
      <p>Throughout the affair, Guardiola has staunchly defended Silva’s character as opposed to engaging with what offence might have been caused elsewhere, earning criticism in some quarters.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, he sounded a similar tone on Friday.</p>
      <p>“In that situation the less important thing is the fact we are going to miss him,” he said.</p>
      <p>“He has been accused of something he is not, so if they want to pick up someone to show something he was the right person.</p>
      <p>“He will be careful using the social media. If this can help to do a better society, okay. I’m pretty sure Bernardo accepts this punishment.</p>
      <p>“He is not like he has been accused. They don’t know him.”</p>
      <p>Despite such controversies and long-term injuries to the likes of Leroy Sane and Aymeric Laporte, Guardiola remained bullish over his team’s prospects of mounting a credible title defence.</p>
      <p>“A few weeks ago there was just two contenders and for the rest it was impossible, now it’s four and maybe six in a few days,” he added.</p>
      <p>“We’re in November, a long time to play and we try to focus on the next one.”</p>
