      <p>While previewing the Nelson Mandela lecture that he is set to deliver, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said his opinions would not be restricted just because he’s a judge.</p>
      <p>Mogoeng will deliver the lecture at the University of Johannesburg on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He said the address would focus on how the Constitution must be transformative to deal with what he called ‘a sick society’.</p>
      <p>The Chief Justice said all citizens including judges have a constitutional right to criticise and suggest solutions.</p>
      <p>“There really is very little that a judge does, based on the Constitution, that is not political in character. There are only a few things that you can’t touch as a Chief Justice because they are political is to say, ‘Go there and vote for so-and-so’.”</p>
