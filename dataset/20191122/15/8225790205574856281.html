      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - Trade winds will strengthen Friday and will bring windy and showery weather through Saturday.</p>
      <p>Showers will be most prevalent over windward and mauka areas, with showers spilling over into leeward communities from time to time.</p>
      <p>The trades are expected to ease a bit next week and veer to the east-southeast as a trough of low pressure develops west of the state.</p>
      <p>Showers will continue to favor windward and mauka areas next week, particularly Maui and the Big Island, with some afternoon and evening shower development possible over interior and leeward locales.</p>
      <p>A northwest swell peaked Thursday and will slowly decline Friday.</p>
      <p>A <b>high surf advisory</b> is in place for all affected areas until 6 a.m. Friday. A reinforcing, moderate northwest swell will fill in this weekend for another round of advisory-level surf for exposed shores.</p>
      <p>A smaller northwest swell is expected for the middle of next week.</p>
      <p>As a result of the strong trades, east facing shores of most islands will see advisory-level surf over the weekend.</p>
