      <h2>Ishant Sharma picked up his first Test fifer at home in 12 years and Virat Kohli became only the sixth Test captain with 5000 runs as India ended Day 1 of the 2nd Test vs Bangladesh in a position of strength.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:45:41+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/sports-desk/" target="_blank">Sports Desk</a></address>
      <p>The first day of the Day/Night Test at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Friday ended with India having a massive advantage over Bangladesh. At stumps, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/virat-kohli/">Virat Kohli</a> (59) and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ajinkya-rahane/">Ajinkya Rahane</a> (23) were unbeaten, having taken India’s lead to 68 runs.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, Indian pacers made the pink ball talk as they crushed Bangladesh for a meagre 106. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ishant-sharma/">Ishant Sharma</a> (5/22) picked his first Test fifer at home in 12 years.</p>

      <p>The visitors were bundled over within two sessions, with India bowling only one over of spin in the 31 overs Bangladesh could survive.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh are also likely to carry other scars from the day. Two of their batsmen – Liton Das and Mohammad Nayeem – were hit on the helmet by <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mohammed-shami/">Mohammed Shami</a> bouncers and both were substituted. This is the first time two concussion substitutes have been brought on in a Test.</p>
      <p>In reply, Cheteshwar Pujara scored a strokeful 55 before perishing in the last hour of the day.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh looked unsettled by the capacity crowd, something they have never encountered even in their home Tests and the world-class bowling made it even more difficult.</p>
      <p>Such was their plight that for the first time in the subcontinent, batsmen Nos 3, 4 and 5 (skipper Mominul Haque, Mohammad Mithun, and senior-most player Mushfiqur Rahim) were all dismissed for a duck.</p>
      <p>Despite the catching scepticism surrounding the pink ball, Wriddhiman Saha looked a class act behind the stump as usual as the ball was swinging a lot after moving the batsman. His low catch of Mahmadullah, outstretched and dragged across Virat Kohli at the first slip, was the highlight of his keeping as he also completed a milestone of 100 dismissals in longest format.</p>

      <p>Kohli also brought up his 5000th run as Test captain in his innings. He became the fastest to 5000 runs as captain, completing the feat in 86 innings.</p>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ricky-ponting/">Ricky Ponting</a> had taken 97 innings to complete 5000 runs as captain, ahead of West Indian legend Clive Lloyd (106 innings), South African Graeme Smith (110), Australian Allan Border (116) and New Zealand’s Stephen Fleming (130).</p>
