        <b>Toxicology testing has ruled out 1080 as a possible cause of death after about 680 rats washed up near Westport recently.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Maanaki Whenua - Landcare Research tested eight dead rats and one weka and <b><a href="https://sciencemediacentre.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=82dd1bbc8e7ac2ef3dbf30994&amp;id=74bc6f59e0&amp;e=806231b737">found no residue of 1080</a></b>. Post-mortem examinations of five of the rats and the weka by Massey University's School of Veterinary Science failed to determine what caused the deaths.</p>
      <p>DOC West Coast Operations Director Mark Davies suggested a surge in rat numbers, combined with hunger and a flood could have contributed to the mass deaths, <b><a href="https://sciencemediacentre.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=82dd1bbc8e7ac2ef3dbf30994&amp;id=96004b9199&amp;e=806231b737">Newsroom reported</a></b>.</p>
      <p>“Rat numbers have exploded in beech forests due to heavy seeding and now seed is germinating, they are desperate for food, which can drive them into new areas and cause them to cross waterways."</p>
      <p>The masses of dead rats were collected from North Beach over the weekend of 9-10 November. Along with the rats and weka, a dead calf, octopus, and crayfish also washed up on the Westport beach.</p>
      <p>Pest eradication expert and scientist John Parkes<b><a href="https://sciencemediacentre.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=82dd1bbc8e7ac2ef3dbf30994&amp;id=adc85ff999&amp;e=806231b737"> told RNZ </a></b>the rats may have starved to death, before being washed into rivers and then up onto the beach in the storm.</p>
      <p>University of Canterbury toxicologist Ian Shaw, who was not part of the testing process, was curious as to why the testing only looked for fluoroacetate (the 1080 poison) and not fluorocitrate - a chemical present in the body following 1080 exposure that lingers longer than the original toxin.</p>
      <p>“If you’ve been poisoned with 1080 you would have high levels of fluorocitrate in your body, particularly your blood. That’s extremely well known,” <b><a href="https://sciencemediacentre.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=82dd1bbc8e7ac2ef3dbf30994&amp;id=90ed6ef7f9&amp;e=806231b737">Shaw said</a></b>.</p>
      <p>As well as the negative toxicology results, Davies said the rats were unlikely to have come from an area where 1080 had been used as the most recent aerial 1080 operation was 140 km upstream from Westport.</p>

      <p>AMR is driven by antibiotic overuse in animals and people. The number of people being infected by antibiotic-resistant superbugs has been on the rise in recent years, with most infections occurring in hospitals. News <b><a href="https://sciencemediacentre.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=82dd1bbc8e7ac2ef3dbf30994&amp;id=39a188fdcd&amp;e=806231b737">emerged in October</a></b> that a person in Canterbury died after contracting a superbug in an overseas hospital.</p>
      <p>While superbug infections were very rare in New Zealand, they were increasing, Dr Joshua Freeman, Canterbury District Health Board's clinical director of microbiology and virology, <b><a href="https://sciencemediacentre.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=82dd1bbc8e7ac2ef3dbf30994&amp;id=9f32212699&amp;e=806231b737">told Stuff.</a></b></p>
      <p>Freeman said that for some potentially deadly drug-resistant organisms, treatment involved using a last-line-of-defence antibiotic, colistin, which was relatively toxic.</p>
      <p>"I'm aware of several serious invasive infections over the last two years where colistin has been the only antibiotic with activity against the infecting bacteria. This sort of thing was virtually unheard of five to six years ago."</p>
      <p>University of Otago biochemist <b><a href="https://sciencemediacentre.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=82dd1bbc8e7ac2ef3dbf30994&amp;id=828b1a17f8&amp;e=806231b737">Kurt Krause said</a></b> New Zealand had significantly less resistance than Europe or North America, but "eliminating routine antibiotic use as a growth supplement in animals," was a step we should be taking to safeguard ourselves.</p>
