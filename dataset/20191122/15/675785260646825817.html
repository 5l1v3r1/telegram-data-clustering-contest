      <p>It’s one of the most well-known constellations in the night sky, and now Orion’s Belt has been caught on camera - both in the sky and reflected in the river below.</p>
      <p>Photographer Vitalij Kopa captured the beautiful photo from Latvia’s Virtrupe river, and NASA has now featured it as its Astronomy Picture of the Day.</p>
      <p>NASA said: “Looking toward the east in the early hours of a September morning this single exposure made with tripod and camera captured a simple visual experience.</p>
      <p>“Rising above the tree-lined slope are familiar stars in planet Earth's northern night and the constellation Orion the Hunter.</p>

      <p>“Brighter stars marking the celestial Hunter's shoulder (Betelgeuse), foot (Rigel), belt, and sword are clearly reflected in the calm waters from northern Latvia's Vitrupe river.”</p>
      <p>Orion is located on the celestial equator, and is clearly visible in the night sky from November to February.</p>
      <p>NASA added: “Winter is coming to planet Earth's northern hemisphere. By then Orion and this beautiful starry vista will be seen rising in early evening skies.”</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time that NASA has featured a photo featuring a reflection as its Astronomy Picture of the Day.</p>
      <p>Last month NASA featured a stunning photo of the Milky Way reflected in the Uyuni Salt Flat in Bolivia.</p>
