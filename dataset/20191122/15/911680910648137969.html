      <h1>St. Luke's trying to find jobs for displaced workers at other facilities</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:36:02+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:36</time> by <a rel="author">Angela Gonzales, Phoenix Business Journal</a></address>
      <p>As Steward Health Care winds down operations of <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/profile/company/org_ch_3c728e519e7f8915e76b74ee638f66ab">St. Luke's Medical Center</a> in Phoenix, the Dallas-based health system is trying to find jobs for the hundreds of employees who will be out of work when the hospital closes Nov. 24.</p>
      <p>"We are looking for every opportunity to transfer St. Luke's employees to equivalent positions at one of our sister facilities in the region â€” Tempe St. Luke's, <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/profile/company/org_ch_e26bb93dc914ba550ca21a68ef85a0e3">Mountain Vista Medical Center</a> and the newly reopened Florence Hospital."</p>
      <p>The hospital will stop taking ambulances and admissions in the emergency department on Nov. 23 at 1:01 am.</p>
      <p>Any patients remaining in the hospital at that time will be transferred to Tempe St. Luke's or to Mountain Vista Medical Center.</p>
