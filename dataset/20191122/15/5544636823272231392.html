      <p>The Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC) Itse Sagay (SAN) has said Bola Tinubu was already wealthy before holding public office.</p>
      <p>Concise News understands that Sagay said this in a reaction to calls for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to probe Tinubu over a bullion van seen conveying cash to his home on the eve of the 2019 election.</p>
      <p>Sagay noted, however, that Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos State, had in the past, used his personal money to help some politicians in the past.</p>
      <p>“Tinubu was already very rich before he became governor. He is not a man who became rich after he joined the government,” he told Daily Independent, Friday.</p>
      <p>“He worked in the petroleum sector. I recalled that during the course of his fight with Abacha, he had to escape for his life in order to join so many other people like Anthony Enahoro, Wole Soyinka and many other pro-democracy activists.</p>
      <p>“Tinubu was the one funding quite a lot of the organisations and those staying abroad. So, he has always been a man of means.</p>
      <p>“It will be ridiculous that having come back to the country, won’t he invest his money into various ventures? So, no one should be surprised that he is a rich man.</p>
      <p>“All I know is that he is rich from his own hard work, investments and therefore, he should be given the benefit of the doubt instead of being subjected to the persecution which some people want him to be subjected to.”</p>
