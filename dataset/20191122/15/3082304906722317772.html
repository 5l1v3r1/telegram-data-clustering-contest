      <h1>Lionel Messi ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo in Ballon d’Or 2019 betting odds</h1>

        <b>According to the latest reports, Lionel Messi has advanced further in terms of betting odds as far as winning the 2019 <i>Ballon d’Or</i> is concerned – and meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo’s odds have increased corresponding to the decrease in the probability of his win.</b>
      </p>
      <p><i><a href="https://www.goal.com/en-au/news/messis-odds-shorten-in-ballon-dor-race-as-ronaldo-struggles/xyytyo1gn8zp1y1qquhvmm4y5">Goal</a> </i>claims that Messi’s odds of winning the award have come down from $3.25 to $2.75 with <i>Sportsbet</i>, as the Barcelona ace scored twice for Argentina during the recently-concluded international break.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Cristiano Ronaldo’s odds have been pushed out to $13, making the 2019 <i>Ballon d’Or</i> more of a race between just Messi and Liverpool centre-back Virgil van Dijk.</p>
      <p>Over the past week, van Dijk saw his price increase slightly to $1.50 but despite so, he remains the overwhelming favourite to win the biggest individual award in football this year.</p>
      <p>Liverpool’s Sadio Mane ($51), Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling ($67) and Mane’s and van Dijk’s Liverpool teammate Mohamed Salah ($101) are further behind in the race for the 2019 <i>Ballon d’Or</i>, according to their betting odds.</p>
      <p>In case you did not know, the award will be given out on December 2 in France. In 2018, it was Real Madrid’s Luka Modric who beat both Messi and Ronaldo – but this year, he failed to make it into this year’s award shortlist.</p>
