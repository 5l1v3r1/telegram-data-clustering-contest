      <h1>Central University awards degrees to more than 1,600 graduands</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:38:48+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:38</time> by <a rel="author">Alexander Nyarko Yeboah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Tema, Nov.22, GNA – The Central University has awarded degrees to more than 1,600 students at a colourful ceremony that drew hundreds of family members and well-wishers to the convocation with high hopes and expectation.</p>
      <p>The 18th Convocation of the University saw undergraduate and postgraduate students of the various faculties, from the Humanities to the Physical Sciences, graduating.</p>
      <p>Mr Kafui Kweku Anyomedie, an Architect and a former student, in a keynote address, commended the graduands for the passion, skill, tenacity and perseverance that had seen them through to success.</p>
      <p>“…These skills should be honed to serve you as you start life outside these great walls”.</p>
      <p>Mr Anyomedie urged them not to dwell so much on their laurels but always look forward to the next challenge with optimism and stick to the University’s ethos of faith, integrity, and excellence.</p>
      <p>“It is incumbent on you by virtue of this education you’ve had to go out there into the world and make an impact, no matter how insignificant you think it is”.</p>
      <p>Mr Anyomedie observed that some failures in life were inevitable, but what mattered most was how one responded to those setbacks and carried on.</p>
      <p>“You have not lived the life fully if you are scared to fail. We’ve all been socialized to regard failure as something you have to avoid at all cost, but it should serve as a reason to do better,” he said.</p>
      <p>Professor Bill Buenar Puplampu, the Vice Chancellor, said progress was a painstaking process of iterative development and urged the graduants to avoid short cuts to wealth and prominence.</p>
      <p>He requested them to be true ambassadors of what they had learned from Central University and settle into big things through “Godly hard work”.</p>
      <p>Prof. Puplampu announced the sod-cutting for the construction of the Central University Clinic, which would be the first phase in the development of a comprehensive Teaching Hospital and Medical School.</p>
      <p>Central University was established with the aim of training transformational leaders for Ghana, and has established itself as a faith-based Christian private tertiary institution with emphasis on developing leaders with sound moral and ethical standards.</p>
      <p>The graduands were from Central Business School, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, School of Architecture and Design, School of Engineering and Technology, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Law, and School of Graduate Studies.</p>
      <p>The Overall Best Student was Ms Adu-Poku Queendela, who graduated with Bachelor of Science in Banking and Finance of the Central Business School.</p>
