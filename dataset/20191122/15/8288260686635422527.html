      <h2>Aston Villa v Newcastle United | Magpies fans have been discussing the Premier League meeting between the two sides on Monday night as they prepare to do battle in B6</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:02:45+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:02</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle United fans have revealed who they want to see in defence for Monday night's Premier League clash with Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>Fabian Schar and Florian Lejeune are both back available for selection and could start the match, with Jamaal Lascelles and former <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villan</a> Ciaran Clark both out injured.</p>
      <p>Matt Ritchie <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-injury-news-aston-villa-17291615">will miss the game as he continues his recovery from an injury picked up in the Carabao Cup clash</a> with Leicester City earlier this season.</p>
      <p>French defender Lejeune is on the comeback trail from a knee injury suffered in April 2019 and he could make his first appearance of the season at Villa Park while Schar has missed the last three League games.</p>

      <p>And Newcastle fans have had their say on how they would <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-bruce-newcastle-united-17301092">line up the defence for the trip to the West Midlands</a> .</p>
      <p>
        <i>Here's the pick of the reaction on social media...</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Danzo Sean Johnston</b> : Yes! Good news! Solid big CB not scared of challenge either and very good in the air him Clark schar back since lacsclles is out</p>
      <p><b>Leigh Bendelow</b> : Schar lascelles lejeune our best 3 personally</p>
      <p><b>Mattie Jeffels</b> : Glad to see him back. Him, Schar and Fernandez at the back and we’re sorted.</p>
      <p><b>Josh Tambakis-Brown</b> : Have Schar and Lejeune played together? That has the makings of a really good CB partnership.</p>
      <p><b>David Milburn</b> : Has to be the best defender on the books its just been so unfortunate that he has been dogged with injuries &amp; some have been caused by bad tackles from apposing players which makes it all the worse for the lad but it will be great to see him back has to make the defence even stronger.</p>
      <p>Daniel Edwards: Better than lascelles imo. Solid addition.</p>
      <p><b>Alex Jennings</b> : Lascelles ain’t getting his place back, mark my words</p>
