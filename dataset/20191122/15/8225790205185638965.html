      <p>HONOLULU (AP) - Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell has signed a bill extending lifeguard service hours from dawn to sundown.</p>
      <p>Caldwell signed the measure into law Thursday with the new hours expected to begin July 1, 2021.</p>
      <p>Officials say current lifeguard hours at most beaches are from 9 a.m. until 5:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Honolulu Ocean Safety and Lifeguard Services oversees 200 miles (322 kilometers) of coastline extending up to 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) offshore at more than 70 beach parks.</p>
      <p>The text of the bill introduced by Councilor Kymberly Pine notes increased demand for lifeguard services due to increasing use of Oahuâ€™s beaches by residents and visitors.</p>
      <p>The city recorded more than 22.5 million visits to beach parks, more than 1 million preventative actions, nearly 105,000 first-aid actions, and more than 2,100 rescues in 2018.</p>
