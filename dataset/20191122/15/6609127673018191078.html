        <b>A TSB banking outage has left customers without wages this morning as payments have failed to appear in accounts.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Consumer expert, Martin Lewis, is calling for consumers to vote with their feet and switch bank accounts following the failures.</p>

      <p>The founder of MoneySavingExpert.com said: "My call to those who are affected by this and angry and disillusioned with their bank is to stop bitching, start switching.</p>
      <p>"Right now you can get paid up to £175 to switch – and some banks which pay, including HSBC, M&amp;S and First Direct, have better customer service ratings and less of a history of IT problems.”</p>
      <p>The issues have left some consumers overdrawn or struggling to buy essentials.</p>

      <p>Others have also reported issues accessing online banking.</p>
      <p>TSB says the issues have now been resolved and that all delayed payments have been completed.</p>
      <p>But customers who were unable to pay rent this morning or who needed to rely on overdrafts, may have incurred charges or fees.</p>
      <p>Gareth Shaw, Head of Money at Which?, said: "It’s beyond belief that customers have experienced more problems as a result of yet another IT glitch from TSB, hot on the heels of a damning report into the bank's system failure last year.</p>
      <p>"With banks increasingly trying to move customers online, these IT glitches are still far too common across the industry, and it’s clear that people need access to cash as a back-up.</p>
      <p>"The next government should intervene with legislation that protects access to cash for as long as it is needed."</p>
      <h3>Best banking bribes - get up to £175</h3>
      <p>
        <b>LEWIS suggests switching to a bank that offers a bonus if you join them - we've made a round-up of these below.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Just a word of warning, don't switch banks just because of a short-term offer as it may not be the best deal for you in the long term.</p>
      <p><b>HSBC Advance:</b> New customers will receive £175 when<a href="https://www.hsbc.co.uk/current-accounts/switching-to-hsbc/"> they switch to the account</a>.</p>
      <p>But you’ll need to pay in £1,750 per month so consider whether you’ll be able to meet this criteria before switching.</p>
      <p>If you can’t afford it, HSBC’s Bank Account offers £75 to switch and has a lower £500 monthly pay-in.</p>
      <p><b>NatWest:</b> You can also get a lower £150 <a href="https://personal.natwest.com/personal/current-accounts/switch-your-banking-to-natwest.html">as long as you switch to a NatWest Select or Reward account before December 6</a>.</p>
      <p>The latter comes with a monthly £2 fee, but you'll get 2 per cent cashback on bills paid by direct debit.</p>
      <p>To get it, you'll need to pay in at least £1,500 per month.</p>
      <p><b>Lloyds Bank:</b> Another option is to switch to <a href="https://www.lloydsbank.com/current-accounts/switch.asp">a new Club Lloyds or Club Lloyds Platinum account</a>, which will give you a £125 bonus.</p>
      <p>On top of the bonus, the account gives a choice of three annual benefits, including six free cinema tickets, a free magazine subscription or a Gourmet Society membership.</p>
      <p>This offer is available to customers who open the account before November 12.</p>
      <p><b>First Direct:</b> It gives new switchers a bonus of £50 <a href="https://www1.firstdirect.com/banking/current-account/">when you open a so-called 1st Account</a>.</p>
      <p>You’ll also get a £250 zero per cent overdraft, and can open a linked 2.75 per cent regular saver.</p>
      <p><b>M&amp;S Bank Current Account:</b> New switchers receive a £100 M&amp;S gift card, with no minimum pay-in, plus reward points when you shop in M&amp;S.</p>
      <p>You also get a £100 zero per cent overdraft and if you stay for 12 months, you'll get another £80 gift card after a year.</p>
      <p>TSB said: "We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and will ensure customers are not left out-of-pocket."</p>
      <p>If you've been affected you should submit a formal complaint to TSB and ask it to reimburse you any charges you've incurred or ask for compensation for the inconvenience suffered.</p>
      <p>If you don't get a response within eight weeks or you're unhappy with the response you do get, you can complain for free to the <a href="https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/">Financial Ombudsman Service</a>.</p>
      <h3>How to switch bank accounts</h3>
      <p>Under the Current Account Switching Service, swapping banks should take seven working days. That includes all your payments, direct debits and standing orders being moved too.</p>
      <p>Just open your new account and then ask your new provider to close your old account using the switch service.</p>
      <p>Make sure you are eligible. Most accounts have certain requirements, such as paying in a minimum amount of cash each month or having a certain number of direct debits.</p>
      <p>You need to make sure you watch your overdraft. Check your new bank will offer you the same limit — and does not have higher costs for using it.</p>
