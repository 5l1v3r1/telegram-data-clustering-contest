      <p>One Gabriel Mugauri (71) from Rusape who in 1986 allegedly connived with three accomplices to murder a fellow villager for ritual purposes was arrested 33 years after the crime.</p>
      <p>His two alleged accomplices, Naison and Edward Ganyani are now late while the third suspect, identified only as Manyengavana, is still at large.</p>
      <p>It is believed that Nyatsanga’s avenging spirit is wreaking havoc and tormenting Mugauri’s family through mysterious deaths and incurable mental illnessess.</p>
      <p>After his relatives consulted with sangomas Mugauri admitted committing the offence and the police were immediately informed</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.manicapost.co.zw/man-arrested-over-1986-murder/amp/">Mugauri confessed fo the crime</a> and led the police to a bushy area where Nyatsanga’s remains were retrieved leading to his arrest.</p>
      <p>.The skeletal remains were taken to Rusape General Hospital mortuary as an exhibit.</p>
      <p>Mugauri has since appeared at Rusape Magistrates’ Court on murder charges</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Mr Benoni Makuvire told the court that Mugauri and his accomplices murdered Nyatsanga and robbed him of the money he intended to use to acquire a grinding mill before Manyengavana sliced off his private parts for use in rituals to boost his business in the village.</p>
      <aside>“Justine Nyatsanga’s last known address is 59 Zata Street, Mbare, Harare. Mugauri and Nyatsanga were not related. Nyatsanga was a nephew to Naison and Edward Ganyani. They are all now late.<br/>“Sometime in 1986, on an unknown date, the now deceased visited his uncles (the Ganyanis) at Mupfururi village. He had a travelling bag with clothes and stayed with them for several days.<br/>“He disclosed to Naison and Edward that he wanted to buy a grinding mill in Harare. Armed with the information Naison and Edward hatched a plan to kill him and seize all his money. They roped in Mugauri and one Manyengavana, who is still at large. Manyengavana wanted body parts for rituals to boost his businesses.<br/>“On the day that Nyatsanga intended to travel to Harare to buy the grinding mill, Mugauri woke up early in the morning and proceeded to the Ganyani homestead. He caught up with Naison, Edward and Nyatsanga. The four proceeded to Dowa Business Centre where Nyatsanga was set to board a bus around 3am.<br/>“Along the way they passed through a bottle store to collect one Manyengavana. When they reached a bushy area at Maripakuenda Farm, in Dowa, Mugauri and his accomplices killed Nyatsanga.<br/>“They took an undisclosed amount of money from him before Manyengavana sliced off his private parts.<br/>“The four suspects dumped Nyatsanga’s body in a nearby hill,” said Mr Makuvire.</aside>
