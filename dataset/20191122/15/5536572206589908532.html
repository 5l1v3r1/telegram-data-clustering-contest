      <h1>Unearthed Recording Has Robert Kraft Blasting Donald Trump During 2017 NFL Meeting (AUDIO)</h1>

      <p>New England Patriots team owner Robert Kraft blasted President Trump in a meeting that was at the height of the National Anthem kneeling controversy in uncovered audio from October 2017.</p>
      <p>Kraft, who is a longtime friend of Donald Trump, could be heard taking a stand against the president’s rhetoric on players who were taking a stand to protest racial injustice in the U.S., according to audio obtained by <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/22/robert-kraft-nfl-donald-trump-kneelers-new-audio/">TMZ Sports.</a></p>
      <p>“I must tell you, I think these dialogues are great,” Kraft said. “But, the elephant in the room now in my opinion, is this kneeling, which every player has a right to do if they feel it’s right.</p>
      <p>“The problem we have is, we have a president that will use that as fodder to do his mission that I don’t feel is in the best interest of the matter. It’s divisive and it’s horrible. And, it’s actually the opposite of what you all are trying to do.”</p>

      <p>“I just hope one of the things that can come out of here is that we find a way to be unified. And, be able to carry through and follow through,” he said.</p>
      <p>That meeting took place in New York City during the middle of the 2017 season. Commissioner Roger Goodell reportedly had even made a point to say “let’s make sure that we keep this confidential.”</p>
      <p>Clearly, that didn’t happen.</p>
