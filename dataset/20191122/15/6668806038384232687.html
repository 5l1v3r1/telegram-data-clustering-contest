      <p>Malaika Arora is known for her smoking look, fit body and killer dance moves. The actress has been ageing like fine wine and the credit sure goes to her dedication to fitness and working out regularly. Malaika seems to be at the gym without fail every day. She even takes to her social media to update her fans with videos from her time at the gym. And much like the infamous airport looks, Malaika has pioneered “gym look” and we sure look forward to her OOTD.</p>
      <p>Earlier today she was spotted stepping out of her car and heading to her gym is a super comfy outfit. The actress looked stunning as she was papped flaunting her washboard abs and toned legs. Her hair was left open and she sported a no-makeup look. She opted for a pair of coloured sunglasses and finished her gym look to perfection.</p>
