      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 22): Pasdec Holdings Bhd said a RM380 million vehicles electrical wiring harness contract awarded to its subsidiary in Botswana by Nissan South Africa (Pty) Ltd has been terminated.</p>
      <p>This was due to due to a "failure to meet targets relating to part price, tooling price, quality, delivery conditions and production capacities" as agreed between the two sides, Pasdec said in a bourse filing today.</p>
      <p>The subsidiary, Pasdec Automotive Technologies (Botswana) (Pty) Ltd, which is held via Padedec's 70% unit in South Africa, Pasdec Automotive Technologies (Pty) Ltd, had bagged the contract in October last year. The seven-year contract had commenced in June this year.</p>
      <p>“The cancellation of the contract will not have any material impact on Pasdec group’s revenue and earnings for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2019 [FY19]," Pasdec said.</p>
      <p>Pasdec's net loss had widened to RM5.75 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 (6MFY19), from RM4.8 million in the same period last year. Revenue fell 18.43% to RM62.59 million, from RM76.73 million.</p>
