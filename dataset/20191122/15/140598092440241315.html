      <h1>Polio worker kidnapped for her role saving lives of Nigerian children honoured </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:23:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/anne-gulland/" target="_blank">Anne Gulland</a></address>
      <p>A polio vaccine worker from northern Nigeria who was kidnapped and held for two weeks by bandits because of her work fighting the disease has been honoured.</p>
      <p>Rahane Lawal was given an Unsung Hero award for her work in encouraging women to have their children vaccinated.</p>
      <p>And, despite being targeted by the criminal gang who thought she was earning large sums of money, she has returned to her role talking to women and families about their health.</p>
      <p>Nigeria<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/africa-set-declared-polio-free-nigeria-marks-three-years-without/"> recently marked three years</a> without a single case of polio, an important milestone on the road to complete eradication for both the country and the entire continent.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/17/500-shackled-children-freed-third-islamic-boarding-school-north/">conflict-riven and lawless northern part of the country</a> was the last haunt of the deadly childhood disease in the whole of Africa as it was often too risky for vaccinators to go out and administer the life-saving polio drops to children.</p>
      <p>Ms Lawal, who was given her honour at the Reaching the Last Mile Forum in Abu Dhabi -where donors <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/bills-billion-dollar-polio-pledge-gates-funds-final-push-eradication/">pledged more than $2billion in the fight against the disease</a> - agreed to become a community organiser as she had seen the benefit of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/vaccines/">vaccines</a> in keeping her own 10 children healthy.</p>

      <p>“When Unicef came looking for volunteers to go out into the community and talk about vaccines I was keen to do it,” she told the <i>Telegraph</i>.</p>
      <p>“My own children are healthy because of vaccines,” she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Lawal does not receive payment for her role - just enough to cover expenses and costs. However, she was targeted because gunmen assumed she was a well-paid member of Unicef staff.</p>
      <p>The bandits came to her family compound at around 2am one night in October last year, woke everyone up and demanded money. </p>
      <p>They tied up her husband and took him to another room while they put a gun to the head of her daughter. When her father-in-law pleaded with them to spare them he was gunned down and killed. </p>
      <p>Ms Lawal lives in a simple family compound and cannot afford to educate her children beyond primary school level.</p>
      <p>“I said to them that we didn’t have anything - I told them they could see where I live. How am I rich?” she says. </p>
      <p>They took Ms Lawal, put her on a motorbike and fled with her into the forest. She was wearing just a wrapper - a sarong-type garment - and nothing else.</p>
      <p>Ms Lawal told her story in the plush surroundings of the Louvre Abu Dhabi, an outpost of the grand French museum and art gallery - a setting completely at odds with her tragic tale. She wept as she spoke and constantly played with a tissue.</p>
      <p>Ms Lawal was held for two weeks while the gunmen attempted to get 20 million naira - just over £55,000 - from her family, an unimaginable sum for her and her family.</p>
      <p>She faced regular beatings and at one point the bandits called her parents and held a gun to her head as they demanded money. </p>
      <p>Her parents were told that she would be shot there and then, as they were on the phone.</p>
      <p>Her parents went to the mosque and asked for donations and sold land and grain, eventually raising about 2 million naira (£5,500). </p>
      <p>This appeased the gunmen and Ms Lawal, alongside another man and woman who were also being held, was released.</p>
      <p>Her family have now fled the area and her children, some of whom witnessed the horror of that night, have flashbacks and jump at loud noises.</p>
      <p>But despite her ordeal, during which she received regular beatings with the butt of a gun Ms Lawal continues her work for Unicef in her new village. </p>
      <p>“When I felt better again I wanted to go back out there and help my community. The award is important to me because it shows that what I’m doing is important and taken seriously,” she said.</p>
      <p>Dr Maha Barakat, advisor to the Abu Dhabi government, said that she and her fellow judges wanted to honour someone who had given the most sacrifice. </p>
      <p>She said that workers such as Ms Lawal and her fellow award nominees were helping to rid the world of disease.</p>
      <p>“Many of them work under difficult conditions, quite often in areas of conflict and sometimes they’re attacked,” she said.</p>
      <p>“The work [local health workers] do is not just locally relevant but regionally, nationally and globally relevant too. We will not succeed in eradicating polio from the world without their help,” she said. </p>
