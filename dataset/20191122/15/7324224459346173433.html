      <p>US President Donald Trump has claimed he is the reason China has not taken steps to crush pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>He said he asked his “friend” Chinese President Xi Jinping not to send in the military.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Fox &amp; Friends in a telephone interview on Friday, Mr Trump said he told Mr Xi that efforts to quash the protests would complicate negotiations for a US-China trade deal.</p>

      <p>China has warned it will retaliate against the US if Mr Trump signs a Bill supporting the Hong Kong protests.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump did not say whether he would veto the Bill, but added: “We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I’m also standing with President Xi.”</p>
      <p>He also said that if it had not been for him, “thousands of people would have been killed in Hong Kong right now and you wouldn’t have any riots”.</p>
