      <p>ROME, Nov 22 — Celtic have been fined €15,000 (RM69,110) by Uefa for illicit banners and offensive chants by their supporters in their Europa League match against Lazio last month, European football’s governing body said today.</p>
      <p>Scottish champions Celtic beat the Italian outfit 2-1 at Celtic Park but the game was overshadowed by events off the pitch.</p>
      <p>A home supporters group displayed signs that read “Brigate Verde” — along with a white star — which bore a resemblance to Italian left-wing organisation Brigate Rosse.</p>
      <p>Another flag depicted Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini hanging with the slogan “Follow Your Leader.”</p>
      <p>Uefa rules prohibit “provocative messages that are of a political, ideological, religious or offensive nature”.</p>
      <p>Uefa’s control, ethics and disciplinary body also hit Lazio with a fine of €10,000 for offensive chanting. — Reuters</p>
