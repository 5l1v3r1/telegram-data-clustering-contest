      <h1>Juventus owe Manchester United money due to 2018 Cristiano Ronaldo transfer</h1>
      <h2>The Serie A champions signed the Portuguese forward last summer for a fee of £88m but they are now required to contribute a percentage to United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:43:59+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:43</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United can expect a payment of over €1m from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> by the end of the season due to a condition as part of Cristiano Ronaldo's move to the Italian giants last summer.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo left Old Trafford to join <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> in 2009 for a then-world record transfer fee of £80m. After nine years at the Bernabeu he then moved on to Juventus, and he helped his side win the Serie A last season.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-united-news-cristiano-ronaldo-17300714">Manchester Evening News</a> Juventus' accounts for last season reveal that they owe United €1.2m as a 'second instalment of a solitary payment' following the move.</p>

      <p>Whilst the amount received is hardly likely to make much of a difference to United's spendings, it will come as a welcome boost to the club's finances.</p>
      <p>'Solidarity payments' came into effect in 2001 and are effectively compensation for clubs who help to develop a player between the ages of 12 and 23.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo has generally been a success at Juventus, although he has recently courted controversy by reacting furiously to being substituted by manager Maurizio Sarri in the wins over Lokomotiv Moscow and AC Milan.</p>
      <p>The five-time Ballon d'Or recently has revealed, however, that his anger was due to frustration at his injury rather than directed towards Sarri for taking him off.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo said: "I tried to help Juventus even playing injured. Nobody likes to be substituted, but I understand the substitutions because I wasn't fit.</p>

      <p>"As well as in the last two games for Portugal, I wasn't 100 per cent. When it's needed to sacrifice myself for my club and the national team, I do full of pride. I knew there were many things involved in these games."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/cristiano-ronaldo-left-out-juventus-20937345">The 34-year-old has been left out of the squad</a> to take on Atalanta this weekend, although he could return for the Champions League clash against Atletico Madrid on Tuesday.</p>
