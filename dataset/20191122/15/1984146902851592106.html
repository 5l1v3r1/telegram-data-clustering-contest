      <p>MILLER Homes is creating a vibrant new community in Sunderland as part of the first phase of the Potters Hill development.</p>
      <p>Those looking to make their next move to Miller Homes at Potters Hill which is taking shape on the southern edge of Sunderland can benefit from its convenient location, near Doxford Park and only four miles from the city centre.</p>
      <p>Choose from 160 three, four and five-bedroom homes, with prices starting from £209,950. There might be no better time to move thanks to a range of incentives to make the moving process even easier, with part exchange and the Government-backed Help to Buy scheme available.</p>

      <p>Part exchange from Miller Homes allows buyers to swap their old home for a brand new Miller home, enabling them to upsize, downsize or swap like-for-like without the task of having to sell their current home.</p>
      <p>If a property qualifies for part exchange, Miller Homes will guarantee to buy at a price based on independent valuations. This eliminates advertising costs and estate agent’s fees and also allows buyers to continue living in their current property until their new home is ready for them to move into.</p>

      <p>A Help to Buy Equity Loan offers assistance for buyers who only have a deposit of 5% through the provision of a 20% equity loan from the Government for those who meet the qualifying criteria, meaning buyers only need to secure a 75% mortgage from a provider.</p>
      <p>Helping buyers to visualise life at the development, a five-bedroom show home is open for viewings. The Jura show home has been interior designed by Amaze Me Interiors, and a stylish pink colour scheme runs throughout.</p>
      <p>On the ground floor is a welcome entrance hall which leads to a lounge with a feature bay window. At the rear spanning the width of the home is a kitchen and family dining area, as well as a handy laundry room. On the first floor are all of the bedrooms, two with en suites, and a family bathroom. The home also offers a double garage.</p>

      <p>Andrew Somerville, sales director at Miller Homes North East said: “We’ve been blown away by how excited people are about the homes we are building at Potters Hill.</p>
      <p>“The location is easily accessible from key roads, making it ideal for commuters getting around the local area. It is especially convenient for those working at Doxford International Business Park which is just over a 10-minute walk away, taking away the stress from the morning commute. Families would settle in perfectly too as there’s so much on the doorstep to enjoy in leisure time.</p>
      <p>“Anyone interested can call into the sales centre Thursday to Monday and speak to our development sales manager.”</p>
      <p>As well as at the sales centre, homebuyers can now reserve their chosen home from Miller Homes using the housebuilder’s online reservation system. This allows buyers to reserve a new home and pay a reservation fee via the Miller Homes website in a few simple steps.</p>
