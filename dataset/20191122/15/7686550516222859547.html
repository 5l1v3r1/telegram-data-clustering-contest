      <h1>New sherry and vermouth bar being opened by people behind one of Cardiff's best restaurants</h1>
      <h2>It'll resemble one of the many tiny 'hole in the wall' bars you can find all over Spain</h2>

      <p>Cardiff's popular tapas restaurant <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/curado-bar-brings-authentic-touch-12459787">Curado Bar</a> is to expand its presence in the capital with a new venue selling sherry and vermouth.</p>
      <p>The latest venture will open on the site of the former <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/cardiffs-popular-bombers-lunch-spot-15968392">Bomber's Sandwich House</a> on Guildhall Place in the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/house-of-fraser-howells-cardiff-17288541">city centre</a> , right next to Curado itself, which took over the old Burger King site on the corner of Westgate Street in 2016.</p>
      <p>Called Vermut - the Catalan for vermouth, a fortified wine - it's the latest expansion from award-winning Spanish deli Ultracomida, which already has venues in Aberystwyth and Narberth.</p>
      <p>The bar, which is purported to be one of the only ones of its kind in the UK, is set to open early in 2020 and will specialise in the sale of sherry and vermouth, both hugely popular aperitifs in Spain.</p>
      <p>All the rage on tap on the continent, the wines will be served on draught and in bottles. They will also form the basis of the extensive range of cocktails that'll be on offer.</p>
      <p>And, while most of us may know vermouth primarily for its role in a classic martini cocktail, Ultracomida's director Paul Grimwood says it's experiencing a resurgence abroad.</p>
      <p>"Vermouth is enjoying a big upsurge in appeal, kind of like the way gin did recently," he says.</p>
      <p>"It's a classic drink of Spain and Catalonia and its profile is growing all the time, especially with the younger crowd.</p>
      <p>"Similarly sherry, which for years was largely known as the drink you kept in the cupboard and only brought out at Christmas when your auntie came round. Well, not any more."</p>

      <p>Also on the menu will be the kind of food that perfectly complements the various types of finos, madeiras and other wines being served, such as pickles, cheeses, cured meats and preserved fish.</p>
      <p>"It's simple stuff, but very tasty," adds Paul.</p>
      <p>"As for the location, it's perfect. There are lots of tiny 'hole in the wall'-type bars all over Spain and this fitted the bill perfectly. That's why we jumped at it."</p>
