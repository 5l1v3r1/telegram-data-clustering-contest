      <h1>X-Force Is About to Make A Major Change to a Character's Mutant Power</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:11:24+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:11</time> by <a rel="author">L.D. Nolan</a></address>
      <p>The luck of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/x-force/">X-Force</a>'s most fortunate mutant, Domino, is about to change.</p>
      <p>Created by Fabian Nicieza and Rob Liefeld, Domino's abilities allow her to swing the odds in her favor. However, the solicitation text for the issue indicates that her luck will change for issues #7 and #8 of Benjamin Percy and Joshua Cassara's <i>X-Force</i>, and that she'll become unlucky. The summary also teases Domino looking for a solution to her predicament with help from Colossus, but the text does not reveal why or when this change might have come about in the first place.</p>
      <p>You can see the covers for the issues below as well as the solicitation.</p>
