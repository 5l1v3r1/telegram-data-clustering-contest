      <h3>It's time to save Amanda, again.</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://stevivor.com/alien-isolation/"><i>Alien Isolation</i></a> Switch release has been dated for 5 December 2019, Feral Interactive today confirmed.</p>
      <p>Originally developed by The Creative Assembly and released in 2014, this Switch release will also include all the DLC previously released for the title. Gyroscopic controls will also be offered on Nintendo’s home-hybrid console.</p>
      <p>“This is without a doubt an <i>Alien</i> game that finally lives up to the franchise’s promise, and one that every gamer should play,” <a href="https://stevivor.com/reviews/review-alien-isolation/">we said in our review</a>. “That said, it’s not for the faint of heart; it’s not full of jump scares, but high-tension and stressful moments will require a certain type of player.”</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://stevivor.com/alien-isolation/">Alien Isolation</a> </i>is currently available on Windows PC, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4 and heads to Switch on 5 December.</p>
