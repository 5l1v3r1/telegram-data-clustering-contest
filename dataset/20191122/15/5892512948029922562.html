      <h1>Sage Northcutt dropping back down to 155 pounds — ‘I learned my lesson’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:25:42+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:25</time> by <a rel="author">Jesse Holland</a></address>
      <p>Former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) welterweight phenom, Sage Northcutt, ballooned up to 185 pounds for his most recent fight, a crushing knockout loss to kickboxing veteran Cosmo Alexandre (<a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/5/17/18629195/video-watch-sage-northcutt-get-ktfo-29-seconds-one-championship-debut-mma">watch it</a>) at the ONE: “Enter the Dragon” mixed martial arts (MMA) event back in May.</p>
      <p>Lesson learned.</p>
      <p>Northcutt will be dropping all the way back down to lightweight when he makes his combat sports return, which could take a considerable amount of time after his “Super” surgery, one that <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/5/19/18631380/sage-northcutt-9-hour-surgery-facial-orbital-cheek-fractures-one-knockout-loss-cosmo-alexandre">required nine hours</a> to put his face back together.</p>
      <p>“I fought up at 185 pounds, so I was eating and drinking a lot to be able to get on some weight because I’m only 23, and I’m trying to put on some muscle, so now I’m going to go back down,” Northcutt said (via <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/sage-northcutt-moving-back-155-pounds-one-championship">MMA Junkie</a>). “I learned my lesson about fighting a weight class too big, going back down to 155, and it’ll be better for me.”</p>
      <p>Northcutt (11-3) snapped a three-fight win streak with his loss to the 37 year-old “Good Boy” and <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2018/11/27/18114374/ufc-dana-white-we-let-sage-northcutt-go-hes-young-needs-some-work-mma">didn’t leave UFC on the best of terms</a>. That said, age is still on his side and he’s got plenty of time to write a new narrative with the Singapore-based MMA promotion, starting with his 2020 return.</p>
