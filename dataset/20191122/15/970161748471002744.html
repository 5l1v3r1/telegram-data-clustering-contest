      <p>Have you ever tuned into Good Morning Britain and thought, ‘this is great, but what it needs is more Margaret Thatcher, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> and drag’?</p>
      <p>Well, it’s your lucky day, as RuPaul’s Drag Race UK’s The Vivienne and Baga Chipz have landed their own show thanks to their Snatch Game characters.</p>
      <p>The pair will appear as Thatcher and Trump on Morning T&amp;T, new web series for World of Wonder, and we’re already cackling at the thought.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Metro.co.uk after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/drag-race-uk-winner-rupaul-vivienne-baga-chipz-divina-dicampo-11197257/">winning RuPaul’s Drag Race UK</a>, The Vivienne said: ‘It’s called Morning T&amp;T, and basically it’s a feature length Snatch Game. It’s like a spoof of a morning</p>
      <p>TV show like Good Morning Britain or Good Morning America, Donald Trump and Margaret Thatcher are the hosts, so as you can imagine, it doesn’t go well.’</p>

      <p>It was the Snatch Game in week four that basically guaranteed that The Vivienne and Baga would make it to the grand final, thanks to their phenomenal impressions of the two politicians.</p>
      <p>But we may never have seen Trump a la Viv, as the 27-year-old also had impressions of Kim Woodburn and Cilla Black up her sleeves – which we’re quite sad we didn’t get to see.</p>
      <p>‘I obviously went in with quite a few characters but I thought Donald Trump, he’s really current, he’s probably the most famous person in the world at the minute,’ Viv explained.</p>
      <p>‘Not gonna lie, I knew it might get a bit more press in America than doing maybe Kim Woodburn. But also to make a bloody idiot of him – more than he’s doing himself, which is hard.’</p>

      <p>While The Vivienne has made it that we can never hear ‘collusion with China’ the same way again, she won’t be turning her talents towards our own blond gaffe-prone leader.</p>
      <p>When asked if a Boris Johnson impression was on the way, she said: ‘Oh, god love, no. I act like a t**t but not that much of a t**t.’</p>
      <p>While most Drag Race queens drop a single the second they leave the show, Viv is hoping to work on her acting and comedy, starting with Morning T&amp;T and the digital series in Hollywood she won – ‘We’re not quite sure [what it will be] yet, but definitely some sort of Vivienne takes Hollywood kind of thing. Break the States.’</p>

      <p>But the queen already has her sights set high to bolster her CV.</p>
      <p>‘I would kill for a cameo in The Catherine Tate Show,’ she admitted.</p>
      <p>‘Obviously she’s not filming that at the minute but she is filming the Nan movie. But I’d love my own Catherine Tate-esque sketch show.</p>
      <p>‘And if anyone is listening that wants to give me a cameo in Jurassic World 3, that’d be nice.’</p>
