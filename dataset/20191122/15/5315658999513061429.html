      <p>A 43-year-old Christchurch man was arrested and charged with the burglary of two building sites, in the new subdivision near Townsend Road Rangiora.</p>
      <p>At about 10:30pm Wednesday 20 November the man went to the building sites where he loaded his van with landscaping equipment from one site, before removing a trailer from the neighbouring site.</p>
      <p>Once the burglaries were discovered, Police were led to the alleged offenders address by a GPS tracking device that was on the stolen property.</p>
      <p>The vehicle involved was also identified through surveillance cameras set up by one of the builders.</p>
      <p>Through the security measures set in place by these builders, Police were able to make an arrest and return the stolen property.</p>
      <p>The alleged offender is due to appear in Christchurch District Court on Monday 25 November.</p>
      <p>Canterbury Police want to remind the community to take precautions against burglars.</p>
      <p>The following measures will help reduce crime:</p>
      <p>• preventing easy access or opportunity<br/>• engraving tools<br/>• locking and securing premises<br/>• using available technology to alarm and monitor your property<br/>• having tracking devices on valuable items</p>
