      </p>
      <p>The Glamour Boys are flying high at present having opened up a healthy lead at the top of the Absa Premiership table and marched into the semi-finals of this season’s Telkom Knockout competition, and on Sunday they face the Team of Choice for a spot in next month’s final.</p>
      <p>Billiat will be full of confidence going into the clash at Mbombela Stadium after netting a brace for Zimbabwe in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier over Zambia, and yesterday he was back at Naturena after jetting to Mzansi following that 2-1 victory.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Chiefs’ official website on his return to training, the 29-year-old has spoken of how Chiefs need to be wary of a Maritzburg side who are on a seven-game unbeaten run of their own, calling them a ‘hardworking team’.</p>
      <p>The attacker said, “I am feeling good… We are in a good space and we are just trying to be as professional as we can. We want to come back now and continue from where we left before the international break - we are expecting a good game, a tough game. They are a hardworking team. If we don’t do the basics correct, they can punish us – they work nicely together.</p>
      <p>“We believe in our team. We are strong and if we go into this game with the right mindset we can win. It’s vital to get to the final, it will boost our confidence individually as well as collectively. It will help us do well in the league and for the rest of the season going forward – that’s why we need to win this game.” </p>
