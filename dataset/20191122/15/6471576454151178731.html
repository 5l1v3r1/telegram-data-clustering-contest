      <p>The third member of the Zeus limited edition is based on the coupe, and it‚Äôs 80 kilograms (176 pounds) lighter than the original. Tipping the scales at 899 kilograms (1,982 pounds), Double-Oh-Three stands out in the crowd thanks to Petrol Volturi Pearl paintwork over carbon-fiber elements, 18-inch wheels up front, and 19s for the rear axle.</p>
      <p>Louvers on the sides of the engine cover, a rear wing, and black exhaust tips are a few other strong points of the exterior design. The color palette is more or less mirrored by the cockpit, where you‚Äôll find seats that wouldn‚Äôt look out of place in a futuristic vehicle from Tron: Legacy. On the passenger side of the dashboard, <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/pogea-racing-s-alfa-romeo-4c-tuned-to-perfection-132599.html">Pogea Racing</a> wrote <i>‚ÄúZEUS.003 custom made for Oksana and Hans Buchban‚Äù</i> to underline the exclusivity.</p>
      <p>The Zeus package retails at 50,100 euros in Germany, which means that 003 costs more than a hundred grand. Pogea Racing built and sold four of ten Zeus models, and every single one of them is as unique as the customer‚Äôs customization choices.</p>
      <p>Under the hood, the mid-engined 1750 turbo four-cylinder develops 355 ponies and 465 Nm at the crankshaft. That‚Äôs seriously more than the standard specification of the 1.75-liter engine, translating to 3.4 seconds to 100 km/h and 304 km/h on the Autobahn. The 76-mm exhaust system, CB camshafts, modified turbocharger, intake, cooling, fuel pump, and injectors are the secret to this suck-squeeze-bang-blow. The dual-clutch transmission has also been updated, now featuring Stage 3 software and ceramic clutch discs.</p>
      <p>The 8.5x18‚Äù wheels up front are complemented by Michelin Pilot Sport 4S 225/40 rubber while the 9.5x19‚Äù rears level up to 265/35s, and yes, the suspension has been changed to coilovers from <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/k.html#ge-kilowatt"><u>KW</u></a>. The final detail of the build is the addition of an oil cooler, designed to keep the TCT gearbox and 1750 engine in check even when driven hard. üèÅ</p>

        <summary>PRESS RELEASE</summary>
        <p>22 NOVEMBER 2019</p>
        <p>Pogea Racing presents the latest design variant of its Alfa Romeo 4C complete conversion.</p>
        <p>Providing automotive highlights again and again is deeply rooted in the POGEA philosophy. With the POGEA RACING 4C ZEUS, based on the Alfa Romeo 4C, the tuning specialist from Friedrichshafen has once again managed to stage such a highlight. The new design concept, designed by Managing Director Eva Pogea, skilfully combines colours and shapes with a multitude of technical modifications. Targeted optimisation of the body, wheels, chassis and engine transform the neat series Alfa into an optical and dynamic muscle package.</p>
        <p>This is already ensured by the extensive bodywork, which subjects the two-seater to an athletic transformation from the front apron to the rear wing. Carbon is also used in abundance: regardless of whether it is hidden under the PETROL VOLTURI PEARL paint coats developed with GLASURIT or if it is visible with the typical fabric structure. POGEA manufactures all its aerodynamic components from the ultra-light and high strength carbon fibre material.</p>
        <p>But this sophisticated manufacturer is not just about looks and aerodynamics. The performance potential of the Alfa unit is also significantly increased by the experienced engine developers by means of the targeted use of high-performance components. Instead of 240 hp (177 kW) the four-cylinder turbo engine now proudly produces 355 hp (261 kW), while the maximum torque increases to 465 Newton metres. Thus fired, the ZEUS accelerates in 3.4 seconds to a hundred km/h and stops only at 304 km/h max. speed.</p>
        <p>In order to transform the tremendous power into forward motion a special combination of wheels and tyres is necessary. POGEA recommends the Pilot Sport 4S high performance tyres from the cooperation partner Michelin in the sizes 225/40 ZR18 for the front axle and 265/35 ZR19 for the rear axle and combines them with POGEA forged monobloc alloy wheels from their own production. The forged wheels manufactured in 8.5x18" for the front axle and 9.5x19" for the rear are an example of another core competence of the South German company: the production of tailor-made forged wheels individually adapted to varying brakes, chassis and body widths. Six patented designs - four of which are bidirectional with a high possible concavity, two are symmetrical - are milled from scratch specifically to customer requirements using the required bolt hole circle and the T√úV-compliant insert depth. T6061 aluminium forged wheels are available in 17"-26" and 14" wide sizes and can be personalised with the buyer‚Äôs name on the ring.</p>
        <p>And the interior is also presented in an individual look. Eva Pogea stylishly combines the finest leather from the US premium supplier Moore and Giles with Alcantara, carbon fibre and decorative stitching and creates a magnificent control centre that perfectly combines functionality and comfort.</p>
        <p>Anyone interested in owning a ZEUS will have to hurry. Four of the ten limited exclusive conversions have been sold already. The Pogea Racing ZEUS starts from ‚Ç¨ 50,100 ex-works in Friedrichshafen including assembly and paint finish. This does not include VAT or the Alfa Romeo 4C basic vehicle.</p>
