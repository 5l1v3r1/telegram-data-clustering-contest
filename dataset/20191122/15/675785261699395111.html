      <p>“They’re [Rashford, McTominay and Greenwood] all doing well.</p>
      <p>“It’s a good set up at United. For any young kid going there, it’s a great club to go to.</p>
      <p>“And I think England are producing great young players who are representing their country and that can only be a good thing.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully Scotland can follow that!”</p>
