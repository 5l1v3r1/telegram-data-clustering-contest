      <p>As Pokémon players will know, several Gym leaders are scattered throughout the region, which you can challenge to earn badges. In this game, you'll be doing so to become the Champion.</p>
      <p>But these Gym leaders are no pushovers either; here's a roundup of their locations, what element they represent as well as providing you with some details as to what Pokémon they have up their sleeve.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Get ready to travel to the land of fairies when you fight Opal - a nice old lady who has a collection of fairy type Pokémon. In her arsenal are a Galarian Weezing, a Mawile, Togekiss, and the delicious Alcremie. Fairy types are weak to steel types, so make sure you have a few Pokémon with these types when you go to battle this gym leader.</p>
      <h3>Gym Leader Gordie - Pokémon Sword Exclusive</h3>

      </p>
      <p>Gordie is Melony's counterpart in Circhester. Instead of having ice Pokémon at his disposal, he will try and stop you with a barrage of rock-type Pokémon. He'll use a Coalossal to Dynamax with, so pack your roster with some ground, grass, fighting, steel, or ice types to cut him down to size.</p>
      <h3>Gym Leader Melony - Pokémon Shield Exclusive</h3>

      </p>
      <p>Make sure you are packing some extra warm clothes when you enter this ice arena. Your opponent in Circhester will be Melony, and she is the icy maiden of Pokémon Shield. She has a Lapras that will Dynamax, so make sure you are prepared and bring some fighting, steel, or fairy types with you.</p>
      <h3>Gym Leader Piers</h3>

      </p>
      <p>Spikemuth has been locked down, and so it's up to you to battle the dark Pokémon master Piers. Bring some fighting, flying, and fairy type Pokémon so that you can withstand the assault from his dark army of Pokémon.</p>
      <h3>Gym Leader Raihan</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <i>Source: Nintendo</i>
      </p>
      <p>Raihan represents the dragon type gym master, and he is the final master that you must defeat before you can challenge the champion. This gym battle is hard as it is themed around double battles, so you'll need to make sure that you bring your A-game when challenging this leader. Try and have as many rock, fairy, or ice types in your roster as possible so that you can pummel him into submission with relative ease.</p>
      <h3>The current champion - Leon</h3>

      </p>
      <p>You must have known this was coming since you started the game... to become the very best like no-one ever was, you'll have to defeat the current champion, Leon. Are you ready to take on his Charizard?</p>
      <h3>I wanna be the very best</h3>
      <p>Now you know how to beat every gym leader in Pokémon Sword and Shield. These battles can be pretty fierce, so you'll want to make sure that your party is stacked with Pokémon that are strong against your opponent's Pokémon. Stock up on revives and potions so you can heal your party as necessary, and you'll be sure to make it far.</p>
