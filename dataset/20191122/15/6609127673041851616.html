        <b>A SCOTTISH BBC journalist has said her period felt like a ‘searing hot knife was being dragged across her stomach’.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fiona Stalker, 48, suffered from agonising pain for 15 years before being diagnosed in her 30s with <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/topic/endometriosis/">endometriosis</a> - a chronic gynaecological condition that affects one in 10 UK women.</p>
      <p>Endometriosis is caused when cells like the ones in the lining of the womb are found elsewhere in the body.</p>
      <p>But instead of leaving the body as a period the blood has no way to escape <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/fabulous/4757264/endometriosis-symptoms-treatment/">leading to inflammation, pain and formation of scar tissue</a> - which can eventually cause infertility.</p>
      <p>Fiona, who co-presents BBC Scotland review show Seven Days, told The Scottish Sun: "I just assumed it was normal to be in excruciating pain until I found out a friend of mine was finally diagnosed with endometriosis.</p>
      <p>“The only way to describe it is as if having a searing hot knife being dragged across the stomach.</p>
      <p>“For so many women they just think that's how it is.”</p>
      <p>The busy mum-of-two, who lives in Aberdeen, says initially she was ‘angry with her body’ and used to deliberately plan her holidays around her period to minimise the disruption to her working life.</p>
      <p>She added: “I remember being quite angry with my body when I was diagnosed - like ‘why are you giving me this pain every month?’</p>
      <p>“Looking back I occasionally used to try and take a day’s holiday when I knew it would be really awful.</p>
      <p>“I would stay at home with hot bottles and painkillers and sometimes just lie in a hot bath for “as long as I could.</p>
      <p>“I remember having to go out in the middle of the night to find a 24 hour supermarket to find painkillers because if not I was not going to find a wink of sleep.”</p>
      <p>Fiona spoke out about her experience on BBC Scotland’s The Nine after more than <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-49897873">13,500 women took part in a BBC survey last month.</a></p>
      <p>The investigation found that millions of women with the hidden condition are<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4807443/millions-of-endometriosis-sufferers-plagued-by-suicidal-thoughts-as-mps-launch-inquiry/"> plagued with suicidal thoughts and rely on highly addictive painkillers</a>.</p>
      <p>It sparked a conversation around the hidden condition which saw MPs promise to launch an enquiry.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’ve always been quite open about it at work with my colleagues so I decided I was going to talk about it whether they liked it or not!</p>
      <p>“When I saw the stuff on the BBC it was quite emotional as it was the first time I’d seen people really publicly talking about endo.</p>
      <p>“I think what really brought home to me in the BBC coverage was how physically and mentally debilitating it can be because you live with extreme pain.</p>
      <p>“For it not to be about someone famous for it to be about normal women struggling on a daily basis was incredible to see.”</p>
      <p>Fiona is supporting The Scottish Sun’s <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/topic/endo-period-stigma/">Endo Period Stigma campaign</a>, which is encouraging women to speak out about their experiences.</p>
      <h3>#endoperiodstigma</h3>
      <p>The Scottish Sun Online has teamed up with <a href="https://www.endometriosis-uk.org/">Endometriosis UK</a> to raise awareness of endometriosis, a chronic and debilitating condition that causes painful periods and affects one in 10 UK women.</p>
      <p>The campaign will run on The Scottish Sun website until March 2020 -Endometriosis Awareness Month - and will tell the stories of women living with endo.</p>
      <p>News Scotland, which includes The Scottish Sun, The Times Scotland and The Sunday Times Scotland, is also delighted to announce it has become the second official <a href="https://www.endometriosis-uk.org/endometriosis-friendly-employer-scheme">Endometriosis Friendly Employer</a> in the UK.</p>

      <p>News Scotland, which includes The Scottish Sun, The Times Scotland and The Sunday Times Scotland, has <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/fabulous/4922941/endometriosis-friendly-employer-sign-up/">also become the second ever Endometriosis Friendly Employer</a> in the UK in a bid to support women across the company living with the condition.</p>
      <p>Fiona added: “I had a very frank discussion with my boss at the BBC and he was very supportive.</p>
      <p>“He went off to find out more about it and went and done research about it.</p>
      <blockquote>I remember being quite angry with my body when I was diagnosed - like ‘why are you giving me this pain every month?’<cite>Fiona Stalker</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“That made a huge difference - being able to be open about it and honest about it.”</p>
      <p>For some women endometriosis can leave them unable to have children.</p>
      <p>Fiona and her partner are now proud parents to twin girls, who are now 10.</p>
      <p>Fiona added: “I went in for a lap and when I came round from the anaesthetic the surgeon said to me ‘we’ve found endo’.</p>
      <p>“It was part relief because it described what it was but part was ‘oh god’ because it's linked with infertility and that sort of thing.</p>
      <p>“It was utterly overwhelming because I was so aware that endometriosis could absolutely mean that my fertility was wrecked.</p>
      <p>“That was always a fear of mine and that was something that is precious.</p>

      <p>“It can be heartbreaking.</p>
      <p>“I was one of the very lucky ones that managed to get pregnant eventually.</p>
      <p>“I've got two little miracles given that I had quite bad endo.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got twin 10-year-old girls and it’s busy but fantastic!”</p>
      <p>Following childbirth Fiona says her pain is now “very manageable”.</p>
      <p>She added: “I still do a lot of exercise - I use that very much as a treatment tool and at the moment - fingers crossed - it’s very manageable.</p>
      <p>“The revolution of what it's like to be pain free is incredible.”</p>
