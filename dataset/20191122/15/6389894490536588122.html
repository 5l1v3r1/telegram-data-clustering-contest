      <p>Prince Andrew has stepped down from his role at tech startup scheme Pitch@Palace.</p>
      <p>The initiative, which the Duke of York founded to showcase entrepreneurs, is set to continue without any royal involvement.</p>

      <p>The Duke has come under increasing pressure as the catastrophic fallout of his Newsnight grilling over links to the late billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein continues.</p>
      <p>The Duke announced earlier this week that he would step back from royal duties, and it emerged on Friday that he was stepping down from the organisation. </p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace denied the Duke had quit the scheme, but <i>City A.M. </i>understands that this is incorrect and he has in fact left Pitch@Palace.</p>
      <p>A source close to the discussions told <i>City A.M.</i> the Duke had decided to “back away” from Pitch@Palace and was “no longer involved” with the scheme.</p>
      <p>The Duke’s departure was first reported by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/22/pitch-out-of-palace-duke-of-york-steps-down-from-pitchpalace-as-event-goes-independent/">Tech Crunch</a>.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day it had emerged Prince Andrew had been forced to cancel a trip to Bahrain to promote the initiative, reportedly after coming under pressure from the royals to postpone the visit.</p>
      <p>Major sponsors including <a href="https://www.cityam.com/standard-chartered-drops-support-of-pitchpalace-as-corporate-firms-abandon-embattled-prince/">Standard Chartered, KPMG, Bosch and Inmarsat have already abandoned the scheme</a>, as well as Advertising Week Europe and Gravity Road. </p>
      <p>It is understood that Pitch@Palace, a mentoring programme which pairs investors with startups, will now be rebranded simply as Pitch.</p>
      <p>The Duke’s former private secretary, who has reportedly departed over her role in organising the Newsnight interview, has become Pitch@Palace’s chief executive.</p>
      <p>Amanda Thrisk had worked for the Duke since 2012, and, according to her Linkedin profile, has been a director of Pitch@Palace since 2014. </p>
      <p>Prince Andrew resigned from his positions as patron of the Outward Bound Trust and chancellor of Huddersfield yesterday amid continued fallout from last week’s interview.</p>

      <p>BT has said it will not work with skills firm Idea while the Duke remains a patron. </p>
      <p>Pitch@Palace has also dropped a controversial requirement in its terms that entitled the Duke and his company to a two per cent stake in businesses that enter the competition, which had been widely condemned after being circulated online.</p>
