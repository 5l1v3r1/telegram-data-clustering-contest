      <h3>What are the current standings?</h3>
      <h3>What is the team news?</h3>
      <h4>Aston Villa</h4>
      <p>Jack Grealish is set to skipper the Aston Villa side in their Premier League home clash with Newcastle on Monday after four weeks out with a calf injury.</p>
      <p>Goalkeeper Tom Heaton is also likely to play after missing the defeat to Wolves last time out with a calf problem, but deputy Jed Steer is out for up to four months with a partial tear in his Achilles.</p>
      <p>Defenders Bjorn Engels and Matt Targett should also figure after overcoming a hip injury and concussion respectively, but winger Jota (hernia) and striker Keinan Davis (hamstring) are not ready to return.</p>
      <p><b>Aston Villa provisional squad:</b> Heaton, Nyland, Guilbert, Engels, Mings, Taylor, Elmohamady, Konsa, Nakamba, Targett, McGinn, Hourihane, Lansbury, Grealish, Trezeguet, El Ghazi, Wesley, Kodjia.</p>
      <h4>Newcastle United</h4>
      <p>Newcastle are hoping Ciaran Clark is passed fit to face his former club after already seeing captain Jamaal Lascelles ruled out until the new year.</p>
      <p>Lascelles has fractured his tibia and faces several weeks out, while Clark reported back from Republic of Ireland duty carrying a knock.</p>
      <p>Florian Lejeune and Fabian Schar are back in training and could provide the defensive cavalry but Sean Longstaff completes a three-game ban and Matt Ritchie is still out with longstanding ankle trouble.</p>
      <p><b>Newcastle provisional squad: </b>Dubravka, Darlow, Manquillo, Krafth, Yedlin, Dummett, Willems, Schar, Fernandez, Clark, Lejeune, Hayden, Shelvey, Ki, M. Longstaff, Atsu, Almiron, Joelinton, Muto, Gayle.</p>
      <h3>What are they saying?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Newcastle boss Steve Bruce believes his side's season could be defined by this calendar year's remaining fixtures:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"I said coming into this run of games, after the international break, this next five or six weeks is probably the defining part of the season. "The games come thick and fast. I think we've got six or seven games in December, which is ridiculous, so it will define the season and where we're going to be. "The difference in a couple of weeks and a couple of wins and what it does, especially to a club like ours, is remarkable. "The players are bouncing around the place, training is as lively as it's ever been and they're all champing at the bit. "Of course we've picked up one or two knocks but we've got one or two getting back fit so let's hope we can keep the run going."</blockquote>
      <h3>What are the odds?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Aston Villa - 11/10</li>
        <li>Draw - 12/5</li>
        <li>Newcastle United - 5/2</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What's our prediction?</h3>
      <p>Two teams struggling at the wrong end of the table. Newcastle, though, are seeing something of an upturn in fortune - winning their last two league games - and the tables may slowly be turning for Steve Bruce.<br/><b>Predicted score:</b> Aston Villa 1 Newcastle United 1.</p>
