      <p>Using this robot vacuum's Wi-Fi connectivity, you'll be able to control it using the iRobot HOME App, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant. It uses visual navigation and mapping to clean every section of your floors. You can also tell it not to clean a specific area. The included sensors warn the device if it is getting near an obstacle or if it's about to fall down a flight of stairs.</p>
      <p>You can schedule this device to begin cleaning at specific times. We recommend programming the unit to work when your home has the least amount of foot traffic, like when everyone is away at work or school. If the vacuum runs out of power while cleaning, it will return to its base, charge back up, and then will continue cleaning where it left off. It isn't the quietest robot vacuum on the market, but it does do a good job sucking up dirt and debris.</p>
      <p>It's a great pick for homes with pets as it uses rubber brushes for picking up debris and fur. It also traps 99% of pet allergens. It only runs for about 75 minutes, which is shorter than other vacuums out there, but still decent. A nice thing about it is that the vacuum lets you know when the dustbin fills up. Some don't let you know and just won't clean until you figure out that you need to empty the trash. All in all, this is a great pick for any home.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Wi-Fi connectivity</li>

      </figure>
      <p>If you're the kind of shopper that just wants something simple that doesn't cost too much, you'll be interested in the iLife V3s Pro. It's a basic machine that doesn't include Wi-Fi connectivity or voice assistant services. However, it offers plenty of other features to make it a worthwhile purchase. For one thing, it has a decently long battery life with the ability to run as long as 100 minutes.</p>
      <p>You can schedule it to clean your home at various times in the day. You can't control it with an app, but it does come with remote control. This will prevent you from bending down each time you want to start the device. Anyone in a multi-level home will appreciate the presence of smart sensors, which prevent the unit from getting damaged either by bumping into things or falling down a flight of stairs.</p>
      <p>Although there are sensors, this device does not have mapping technology, so you can't tell it to go to specific rooms and clean. Additionally, if it's in the middle of a cleaning cycle and it runs out of power, it will return to the charging dock. However, it won't continue the cleaning process once it's gotten some juice.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Inexpensive</li>
        <li>Runs up to 100 minutes</li>
        <li>Schedule cleaning times</li>
        <li>Comes with remote</li>
        <li>Smart sensors</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Doesn't map rooms</li>
        <li>No Wi-Fi or voice assistant connectivity</li>
        <li>No app</li>

      <h3>Best for Medium-Pile Carpets: Eufy Robovac 11S Max</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/09/eufy-robovac-11s-max-lifestyle.jpg?itok=JWcjHOJ8"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Since most robot vacuums are designed specifically for hardwood floors or low-pile carpets, finding something that works on fluffier flooring isn't always easy. The Eufy 11S Max boasts the ability to work on anything from medium-pile carpets and down. Another thing that we love about it is that it's designed to run quietly, which makes it perfect for use in apartments or when you have a sleeping child.</p>
      <p>The battery runs up to 100 minutes at a time, which allows the device to reach several different areas before returning to its dock. It doesn't have an app, and you won't be able to control it using either Alexa or Google Assistant. However, it does come with a remote, so you won't have to bend down and touch the vacuum whenever you want it to start. There are 10 infrared sensors to prevent the device from bumping into things or falling down stairs. However, this unit does not have any mapping functions.</p>
      <p>Not having fancy Wi-Fi features makes it a more affordable unit. It's not the cheapest one we found, but it offers plenty of other conveniences to make it worth the cost. It has a stylish, minimalist look that will look good in any home.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Handles medium-pile carpets</li>
        <li>Operates quietly</li>
        <li>Runs up to 100 minutes</li>
        <li>Decently priced</li>
        <li>Comes with remote</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>No voice control</li>
        <li>No app</li>
        <li>No mapping</li>

      <h3>Best Battery Life: Roborock S6</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/09/roborock-s6-lifestyle.jpg?itok=dF0sRhkK"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Of all the vacuums we encountered, this one offered the longest battery life while still being an attractive option. When in quiet mode, it can run for up to 180 minutes before needing to recharge. That means it can reach more areas in your home in one go. The dustbin is on the small side, so you'll need to change it out more frequently than you would with some others.</p>
      <p>To get started, you can either give a voice command using Amazon Alexa, or you can use the Mi Home app. This unit has different modes to take care of a variety of situations. One of those modes includes mopping. Attach a microfiber towel to the underside, and the unit will spritz a small amount of water as it goes. It's designed to leave your floors relatively dry, so you don't worry about your hardwood flooring getting damaged.</p>
      <p>While it can suck up a decent amount of debris and dust, it, unfortunately, can't detect the difference between carpet and floor, so the unit might attempt to mop your carpets. You'll just need to redirect it if it's heading somewhere you don't want it to go.</p>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Runs up to 180 minutes</li>
        <li>Works with Alexa</li>
        <li>Controlled with app</li>
        <li>Has mop mode</li>
        <li>Tackles large areas</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Small dustbin</li>
        <li>Mop modes doesn't detect carpets</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Best Battery Life</h4>

      <h3>Best Splurge: iRobot Roomba i7+</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>This is the most expensive unit on this list by far, but if you've got the money and want something super convenient, we highly recommend splurging on this robot vacuum. It has an automatic dirt disposal feature, which means that it empties its dustbin into the included Clean Base whenever it gets full. It will go right back to cleaning where it left off after the dump has been made.</p>
      <p>This self-dumping ability makes it a great choice for busy households or pet owners since it will be able to collect a larger amount of debris without needing your assistance. The Clean Base holds 30 bins worth, so you won't have to clean it out super often. Just keep in mind that when the robot dumps its load, it can be pretty loud.</p>
      <p>The vacuum itself features rubber brushes to pick up crumbs, fur, or dirt better. This is an advanced robot, so it learns and maps out your home. This means that you can specifically tell it to clean a certain room or to leave a specific room alone. Use voice control or the iRobot HOME app to schedule cleaning times or monitor your unit.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Empties its dustbin</li>
        <li>Recharge and resume</li>
        <li>Floor mapping and room skipping</li>
        <li>Works with Alexa and Google Assistant</li>
        <li>Control with iRobot HOME app</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>

        <li>Expensive</li>

      <h3>Best for Homes with Stairs: Eufy RoboVac 15C Max</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/09/eufy-robovac-15c-max-lifestyle.jpg?itok=MWSRbnRH"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The last thing you want is for your expensive robot vacuum to take a fatal tumble down a flight of stairs. You could always put up a baby gate, but it would just be nicer if you didn't have to worry about it in the first place. The Eufy RoboVac 15C Max features more than 10 infrared sensors to detect both ledges and obstacles to prevent your machine from getting damaged. It can run for up to 100 minutes on a single charge to clean a large area of your home.</p>
      <p>You can also set up a cleaning schedule on the EufyHome app so that the vacuum cleans when everyone is out of the house. Since the sensors are in place, you won't have to worry about the device falling anywhere while you're away. If you happen to be out and about, and you want the vacuum to start cleaning, you simply open the app and choose from four different modes. Since it has built-in Wi-Fi, you can also use voice controls via Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. It even comes with a remote if you'd prefer to control it that way. It works great on anything from hardwood floors to medium pile carpets.</p>
      <p>This particular vacuum doesn't come with boundary strips, and you cannot set up a no-go zone through the app. This means that you'll need to physically barricade areas that you don't want your vacuum entering. Unfortunately, it doesn't map your home either. However, considering the features it offers and the relatively low price, this is a great vacuum for any multi-level house.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>

      <h3>Best for Corners: Neato Botvac D4</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/09/neato-robotics-d4-lifestyle.jpg?itok=KkAWdfIN"/>

      <p>Have you ever walked to a corner of your home and discovered a nasty buildup of dust and hair? The round design of most robot vacuums makes it hard for them to reach these cornered dust piles. Unlike other vacuums, the Neato Robotics D4 has a flat side, which allows it to reach these corners better and suck up neglected debris. Just be aware that it doesn't have side brushes. It employs sensors to help it navigate around objects and furniture.</p>
      <p>It isn't the most expensive unit on the market, but the price is mid-range. That's because it offers several advanced features, like mapping. You'll need to take the time to map your home with the device, but once that's done, the vacuum will be able to clean in a more orderly fashion. You can even set boundary lines to prevent the vacuum from entering specific locations.</p>
      <p>This vacuum won't run as long as other units as it tops out at 75 minutes. But it will go back to it's charging dock on its own and will alert you if the bin gets full. You can control it using the app, Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple Watch.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Mapping</li>
        <li>Can set No-Go lines</li>
        <li>Anti-bump sensors</li>
        <li>Works with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Watch</li>
        <li>Automatically recharges itself</li>
        <li>Alerts you to empty bin</li>

      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Only runs up to 75 minutes</li>

      <h3>Best for Pet Hair: Roborock S5</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>In addition to having the second-longest battery life on this list, this vacuum is great at sucking up pet hair and allergens. Having 150 minutes of run time means it can reach more areas. Just note that it has a smallish dustbin, so you'll need to change it out frequently for the vacuum to be effective.</p>
      <p>The vacuum detects when it's on the hardwood floor or when it's on the carpet and increases the sucking power when on the latter. This is a smarter device than some others as it can map your home and thus clean your floors in an organized fashion rather than randomly bouncing around. You can even tell it not to enter certain locations.</p>
      <p>To help pick up all of the grime, you can even attach a small mop to the vacuum and have it clean your floors more thoroughly. Just be aware that it will try to mop your carpet as well as your hard floors. Should it come across any obstacles or stairs, the sensors will prevent it from hitting anything or falling. You can control it using the Mi Home app or Alexa.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Runs up to 150 minutes</li>
        <li>Scheduled cleanings via app</li>
        <li>Mapping</li>

      <h3>Best for High-Traffic Areas: iRobot Roomba 675</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/09/irobot-roomba-675-lifestyle.jpg?itok=QRSlfX9z"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Entryways, kitchens, and other frequently visited areas of your home tend to attract a lot of particles and dust. If you're having a hard time keeping these areas clean, then you'll want to check out the iRobot Roomba 675. It has a built-in Dirt Detect sensor, which allows it to focus in on areas that need extra cleaning. To help with the cleaning process, it employs an edge sweeping brush and has a three-stage cleaning system. It's capable of picking up anything from dirt to pet hair.</p>
      <p>Something I like is that it can automatically adjust its sucking power when transitioning from hard flooring to carpets. What's more, the 90-minute battery life allows it clean for long stretches before it automatically heads back to the dock for recharging. You'll be able to set a cleaning schedule for it to clean when there are few people in your home. To begin vacuuming, simply use the iRobot Home app or give a vocal command to either Alexa or Google Assistant.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, it won't be able to map your home, but it does have sensors to prevent it from falling down a flight of stairs or hitting furniture. That way, you won't have to worry about heavily monitoring it while you're busy doing something else. However, you will need to set up some sort of barricade if you don't want it entering a specific room. It doesn't have a virtual wall for telling it where not to go.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Features a Dirt Detect sensor</li>
        <li>Works with Alexa and Google Assistant</li>
        <li>Uses app to schedule and monitor cleanings</li>

      </figure>
      <p>Anyone looking for a relatively inexpensive robot vacuum that offers a lot of features will appreciate the Ecovacs Deebot N79S. At a relatively low cost, it still features Wi-Fi and allows you to control it with Alexa or Google Assistant. It has a simple app that you can use to schedule cleaning times, change modes, or check the status on your device.</p>
      <p>It also has an impressive run time of 110 minutes. This isn't the longest battery life we've seen, but it's better than several higher-end vacuums. When the battery gets low, it automatically heads back to its dock to recharge itself. You won't have to constantly babysit it either. It features sensors to detect obstacles and ledges. That way, it won't take a tumble down the stairs during a cleaning.</p>
      <p>Since this doesn't cost very much, it's missing features that you'd find in a more expensive unit. For example, it cannot map your home. Because of that, it will bounce around when cleaning and might not be as thorough as more expensive units.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Runs up to 120 minutes</li>
        <li>Works with Alexa and Google Assistant</li>

      <h3>The bot to buy</h3>
      <p>When looking through the hundreds of different robot vacuums on the market, you might feel overwhelmed trying to decide which is the best fit for you. You'll want to take into consideration the unit's price, dustbin capacity, battery life, suction power, control options, and any extra convenient features it might come with. There are several good options to choose from out there.</p>
      <p>Our personal recommendation is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-960-Vacuum-Connected-Mapping/dp/B01ID8H6NO?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU77551YYm">iRobot Roomba 960</a>. This is a powerful unit that can suck up anything from dirt to pet hair. It offers Wi-Fi connectivity so you can control it with the iRobot HOME App, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant from just about anywhere. It can map your home for a more thorough and efficient cleaning experience. You can also set up virtual barriers to prevent it from entering areas you don't want disturbed, making it the most appealing option on our list.</p>
      <h3>How to find the Best Black Friday deals on robot vacuums</h3>
      <p>Robot vacuums have been around for a while at this point, but if you haven't previously owned one, it can be a bit tricky to understand all of the different features and specs you should keep an eye out for before handing over your cash. One of the most important things to be aware of is battery life. Each robot vacuum has a differently-sized battery, and the larger the battery it has, the longer it'll be able to perform a cleanup job before needing to charge back up. Similarly, having a large dustbin is also essential. A bigger dustbin allows your robot vacuum to store more dust, dirt, hair, etc. before needing to be emptied, so if you have an especially large home, a large battery and dustbin are essential to having the best possible experience. You'll also want to think about the "smart" features each robot brings to the table. Some robot vacuums navigate your home based on bump detection (effectively changing direction when it runs into a wall). In contrast, others can make a virtual map of your home and use that to better-understand where it's going. Those enhanced features cost more money, but they can add a lot to your overall enjoyment of your new robot friend.</p>
      <p>iRobot is perhaps the most recognizable robot vacuum company with its lineup of Roomba vacuums, and we fully expect to see some Black Friday discounts on these. The Roomba i7+ is the most advanced robot vacuum on the market right now, and Black Friday should be the perfect time to add it to your home while spending as little as possible. Roborock, Eufy, and other companies have been making their voices heard, too, and are great brands if you're looking for something a bit more affordable.</p>
      <p>As the robot vacuum savings start to pour in, we'll keep this guide updated with the latest and best deals so you can rest assured you're getting the best price possible for your new robot friend. And, if you like the coverage you see here, be sure to take a look at the other Black Friday guides here on Android Central for even more savings on other tech products.</p>
      <h3>How to choose the best robot vacuum</h3>
      <p>It can be hard choosing the right robot vacuum for your house. There are so many on the market with so many different abilities. There's more to it than simply getting something that can vacuum your home.</p>
      <p>Each robot vacuum has different abilities and conveniences features that you'll want to consider. Typically, the more you pay for a robot vacuum, the more conveniences you get. However, you can still find some decently priced options. Here are a few things that can help you find the best option for your needs.</p>
      <h4>Battery Life</h4>
      <p>If a robot vacuum is super good at sucking up debris but doesn't last long, it's going to take a long time to clean your home. Ideally, you'll find a vacuum with a long battery life.</p>
      <p>For something that can last for long stretches, we recommend the Roborock S6. It can last up to 180 minutes at a time before needing a recharge. That way, it can tackle large areas or particularly messy sections of your home. If it doesn't hit everything in its first run, it will recharge and continue cleaning.</p>
      <p>The Roborock S5 also has an impressive run time of 150 minutes, so it'll be able to clean more floors before heading back to its dock. This one also has a recharge and resume feature, so it will make sure to get every section of your home after it gets more juice.</p>
      <p>The third longest battery life goes to the Roomba i7+, which has a respectable run time of up to 120 minutes. This powerful vacuum will make the rounds in your home and reach more inches of the floor before needing to head back to the dock. If it runs out of juice before cleaning your entire home, then it will pick up where it left off once it's recharged.</p>
      <h4>Best robot vacuums, ranked by Battery Life</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Roborock S6 - 180 mins</li>
        <li>Roborock S5 - 150 mins</li>
        <li>iRobot Roomba i7+ - 120 mins</li>
        <li>Ecovacs Deebot N79S - 110 mins</li>
        <li>Eufy Robovac 11S Max - 100 mins</li>
        <li>Eufy Robovac 15C Max - 100 mins</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Dustbin Capacity</h4>
      <p>If a vacuum can run for a long time, but the dust container is small, then you'll need to empty the dustbin frequently to keep it running smoothly. Ideally, you'll choose a vacuum that has both a long battery life and a decent-sized dustbin. Here are the devices with the largest debris containers.</p>
      <p>Technically the Neato Botvac D4 has the largest container at 0.7 liters. However, it has a smaller run time than most of the other devices on this list - only 75 minutes. Still, if you only need it to go over a couple of rooms, this vacuum's larger-than-average dustbin is an ideal option.</p>
      <p>The magnificent iRobot Roomba i7+ has a 0.6-liter dustbin, which is impressive on its own, but this device offers a lot more convenience than that. When the dustbin gets full, the vacuum empties its load into the included cleaning base. The cleaning base can hold up to 30 containers worth of dust and debris before you need to empty it. Since this vacuum also has a charge and resume feature, you won't have to do nearly as much work when dealing with the debris container.</p>
      <p>There's a tie for the next best capacity. Both the RoboVac 15C Max and the RoboVac 11S Max have a 0.6 L dustbin. Between the two, the RoboVac 15C Max gives you more for your money while only costing about $10 more. Either way, these Eufy robot vacuums will help keep your floors clean with their large dustbins.</p>
      <h4>Best robot vacuums, ranked by Dustbin Capacity</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Neato Botvac D4 - 0.7 L</li>
        <li>iRobot Roomba i7+ - 0.6 L</li>
        <li>Eufy RoboVac 15C Max - 0.6 L</li>
        <li>Eufy RoboVac 11S Max - 0.6 L</li>
        <li>Ecovacs Deebot N79S - 0.52 L</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Smart Functions and Conveniences</h4>
      <p>There's more to a robot vacuum than simply sucking things up. The reason people buy these devices is for convenience. The most convenient vacuums create a map of your home and cover every inch of the floor instead of bouncing around haphazardly. The best also includes the ability to set up virtual walls on an app to prevent your vacuum from entering areas you don't want it to go. Some machines can even mop or can be controlled using a smart home assistant. Here are the best robot vacuums ranked by smart functions and convenience features.</p>
      <p>When it comes to convenience, the iRobot Roomba i7+ is miles ahead of its competitors. For starters, you can control it with an app or a smart assistant. It maps your home and thoroughly covers every inch of your floor instead of bouncing around randomly. But what makes it the most convenient choice is the cleaning base. When the vacuum's dustbin gets full, it automatically heads to the cleaning base and empties its load. The cleaning base can hold up to 30 dustbin loads in all. That way, you won't have to keep emptying the dust and debris nearly as often.</p>
      <p>The Roborock S6 is another helpful device that will make cleaning your house easier. It features 10 infrared sensors to prevent the unit from bulldozing into your belongings or fatally falling down a flight of stairs. You control it using an app, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant. It makes a map of your home and zig zags thoroughly all over your floors. You can even tell it where not to go. Should the battery run out of juice, the device will recharge at the dock and then resume cleaning. Finally, it even can mop your hard floors. You simply attach the included mop to the underside of the device and fill the included tank with water.</p>
      <p>The Neato Botvac D4 is also an impressive device with several conveniences. The app is easy to use and allows you to both control and monitor the vacuum. You can also use the built-in Wi-Fi to control the unit using Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. This vacuum also maps your home, which allows it to clean your floors in an orderly fashion rather than running around randomly. You can use the virtual walls within the app to prevent the device from going into specific areas of your home.</p>

      <h3>Price (lowest to highest)</h3>
      <p>Price is going to be a factor for any purchase you make. Just keep in mind that the most economical options tend not to have as many conveniences as the more costly ones. If you're simply looking for a budget option, then here are some choices to consider.</p>
      <p>The iLife V3s Pro is the least expensive unit on this list by far. It does a great job of cleaning hard floors and low-pile carpets without the help of any Wi-Fi functionality. You won't be able to control it using an app or a smart home assistant, but it does come with a remote.</p>
      <p>Ecovacs Deebot N79S is a popular choice for many consumers. It only costs $200, but it can still be controlled using an app or smart home assistants. It might not have the ability to map your home, but it provides excellent cleaning for the areas it hits.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Eufy RoboVac 11S Max is another great budget buy. It's a little more costly than the two mentioned above, but it works great on hard floors and carpets up to medium-pile height. It also comes with a remote, so you can still control it from a distance even though it doesn't have an app.</p>
