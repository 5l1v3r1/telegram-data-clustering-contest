      <h1>Former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez gives verdict on Premier League title race</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool are eight points clear of Leicester at the top of the Premier League as they look to lift the title for the first time since 1990 - something Luis Suarez narrowly missed out on</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:04:15+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:04</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Luis Suarez says he can't imagine Liverpool allowing their eight point lead at the top of the Premier League table slip this season.</p>
      <p>The Reds are flying high in the league as they hunt for their first title since 1990, having narrowly missed out last season by a point to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> last year.</p>
      <p>They are currently eight points clear of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> , nine points up the road from City and already have 17 more points that fifth placed Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>But former Reds striker Suarez believes Jurgen Klopp's men are well-placed to end their Premier League hoodoo and lift the trophy at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>"[Winning the Premier League] is difficult because the season is very long," Suarez told <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/soccer-transfers/story/3995508/barcelonas-luis-suarez-mls-transfer-a-nice-possibility">ESPN FC.</a> "But they have a nice advantage at the moment and with this current <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> side, it's complicated [to imagine] them letting that slip. But we all know how football is.</p>

      <p>"They had a similar advantage at one stage last season and, in the end, Manchester City won the league.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> hit man Suarez is well versed in Liverpool title challenges - having been a key member of the Merseyside club's charge in the 2012/13 campaign.</p>
      <p>The Uruguayan plucked 31 goals to lift the Golden Boot, but that didn't translate to collective silverware as Brendan Rodgers' troops ended up two points adrift of City.</p>

      <p>"We were close to winning the league at Liverpool with young players," Suarez said.</p>
      <p>"We almost managed it without the budget they have today. Given everything Liverpool are now, to have won it then would have had more merit."</p>
      <p>Suarez left Liverpool to join Barca for £65million after that near-miss, where he has since stayed.</p>
      <p>But the now 32-year-old is out of contract at the end of next season, with a switch to the MLS strongly mooted.</p>
      <p>Suarez said" "MLS is a competition which has grown a lot in the last few years and you can see that with the young players that have moved there in the last two years, above all the South Americans.</p>
      <p>"That shows that the league wants to grow and not just bring in players of a certain age that are going to retire there. They look for that mix to make the league better.</p>
      <p>"I have a contract with Barca and I am very happy here. In the future you never know, it's an attractive league.</p>
      <p>"Given that I have been lucky to have had success at the top level for a long time, what I would look out for [next] is stability for my family and the well-being of my children. They would all make the decision along with me and the United States is a nice possibility."</p>
