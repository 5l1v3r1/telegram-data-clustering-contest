      <h1>Heung-Min Son would be ‘perfect fit’ for Liverpool – James Pearce</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:15:25+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>In a Q&amp;A for the <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1400881/2019/11/22/live-qa-discuss-the-latest-at-liverpool-with-our-reporter-james-pearce-fri-22nd-nov-12pm-gmt-7am-et/">Athletic</a> today, James Pearce told a Liverpool supporter that our interest in the South Korean forward Heung-Min Son is just a ‘rumour,’ although the Spurs forward would be a ‘perfect fit’ for the Reds.</p>
      <p>Liverpool fans began<a href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/2019/11/20/many-reds-reckon-this-son-fabinho-firmino-video-shows-son2020-could-be-a-thing/"> petitioning online for the club to sign Son</a> recently, especially after seeing him chatting to Fabinho and Roberto Firmino following the Brazil v South Korea friendly earlier in the week.</p>
      <p>And while stylistically he has all the attributes to suit the manner in which Jurgen Klopp attacks, it’s not on the horizon, reckons Pearce.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“It’s just a rumour in the aftermath of Pochettino leaving Spurs. Nothing more to it than that at this stage. However, I do think Son would be a perfect fit for Liverpool,” he said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Son is a terrific player in that he’s quick, agile and a superb finisher off either foot – but the big issue is his age.</p>
      <p>Next summer, he’ll be 28-years-old, and Liverpool under FSG simply never spend massive money on players over the age of 27 – especially ones who rely so much on pace.</p>
      <p>And what’s more, Spurs charge an absurd amount to sell their players, which is well within Daniel Levy’s right.</p>
      <p>Finally, we can’t imagine Jose Mourinho wanting to do Klopp any favours!</p>
      <p>The forward we buy next year will hopefully share many of Son’s traits, but likely be five years younger – at least.</p>
