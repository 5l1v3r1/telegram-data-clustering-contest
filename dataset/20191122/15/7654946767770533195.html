      <p>Dan Le Batard has explained why his dad has gone missing.</p>
      <p>Gonzalo “Papi” Le Batard is a popular fixture on his son’s ESPN show, “Highly Questionable,” but had not appeared the past two weeks. Dan Le Batard addressed fans’ concerns on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“My father is in good health, he’s just been punching a clock for 50 years and doesn’t want to necessarily be working every day,” <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/greg-cote/article237605949.html">Le Batard said on his radio show, according to the Miami Herald.</a></p>
      <p>“He had a pretty hard time telling me he didn’t want to be working every day. There was a palpable sadness when I sat down in the chair and [for the first time] he wasn’t next to me.”</p>
      <p>The pranking “Papi” may not be officially retired from his TV role, but is likely done with the everyday co-hosting role on the Miami-based show, which has been on since 2011 and currently airs weekdays at 4:30 p.m. on ESPN. Sarah Spain, Israel Gutierrez, Mina Kimes and Katie Nolan have filled in on the three-person desk in Papi’s absence.</p>
      <p>“He’ll come in when he wants to,” said Dan, who got married this past weekend. “He’s 76, and he wants to be working less at the moment. We’ll see if that sticks.”</p>
