      <p>Previewing next week's key macroeconomic data releases from the United States, "We expect durable goods orders to retreat -1.0% m/m in October, stringing together its second consecutive decline," said TD Securities analysts.</p>
      <h3>Key quotes</h3>
      <p>"Further weakness in vehicle orders and a new drop in the ex-transportation segment are likely to keep orders subdued during the month. We also expect capex orders to register their third consecutive decline at -0.5% in October."</p>
      <p>"PPI and <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">CPI</a> data suggest core PCE inflation likely remained steady at 1.7% y/y in October, despite a notable m/m increase in healthcare prices."</p>
      <p>"On the other hand, headline PCE likely rose a tenth to 1.4% y/y. Separately, we expect personal spending to advance 0.2% m/m for a third consecutive month in October, with a firm increase in services spending leading the upside."</p>
