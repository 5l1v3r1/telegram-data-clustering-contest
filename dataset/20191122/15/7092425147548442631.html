      <p>Amy Huberman has shared a hilarious behind-the-scenes photo of her "freezing" cast and crew on the set of <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/entertainment/amy-hubermans-finding-joy-renewed-second-season-343339"><i>Finding Joy</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The show is currently filming its second season and it looks like creator Amy is to blame for the cold weather condition faced by the crew!</p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram, Amy can be seen shivering alongside her co-stars on a beach.</p>

      <p>She captioned the funny photo: "When a writer thinks a beach scene is a nice idea when she's writing the scripts during the summer on a balmy hot day. But then they have to go and actually film it in the middle of the winter.</p>
      <p>"What animal would do this?!?! Oh crap, I'm that animal. Sorry to basically all the cast and crew."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2019/1115/1091086-huberman-so-excited-to-begin-filming-finding-joy/"><i>RTE</i></a> has revealed that season two of the series will focus on Joy's journey as an independent entrepreneur struggling to build her online brand and attempting to find the joy in everyday life.</p>
