      <p>Students from government-run schools and members of the Students Federation of India (SFI) were protesting over the alleged negligence of school authorities in the death of a 10-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>Clashes broke out between police and students after protesters breached a barricade and entered a police station in the Waynad area.</p>
      <p>The students marched through the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911221077369702-jnu-fee-hike-massive-protest-in-delhi-for-indian-education-ministers-resignation/">streets holding placards, chanting slogans</a>, demanding stern action against the Parents Teachers Association (PTA) and teachers who “refused to rush the student to hospital”. When the protesters turned violent, police used batons to disperse them.</p>
