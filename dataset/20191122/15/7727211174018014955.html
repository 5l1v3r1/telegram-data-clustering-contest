      <h1>Liverpool FC fans can watch games free on Amazon Prime this December</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool's games against Everton, Watford and Leicester will all be televised throughout the festive football season</h2>

      <p>December is often a critical month in a Premier League season.</p>
      <p>Liverpool may currently be riding high at the summit of the Premier League, but Jurgen Klopp's side must soon navigate their way through a hectic fixture schedule like no other.</p>
      <p>Along with the conclusion of the Champions League group stage, Liverpool must play six league games, a Carabao Cup quarter final and also travel halfway across the world to compete in the FIFA World Club Championships in Qatar.</p>
      <p>On paper, Liverpool's toughest fixtures - Everton at Anfield and Leicester City at the King Power - will be shown live on <a href="https://amzn.to/33a6G36">Amazon Prime</a>.</p>
      <p>Not only will Amazon's deal allow fans of all Premier League clubs to watch their own side in action simultaneously, they can even do so entirely free of charge.</p>
      <p>With use of a 30-day Amazon trial, footy fans can even discontinue their Prime subscription before a payment has been taken from their account.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere throughout the month of December, Liverpool's midday fixture against struggling Watford at Anfield on Saturday December 14th will also be broadcast live on BT Sport.</p>
      <p>While there has been no official confirmation, early rumours also suggest that BT Sport will broadcast Liverpool's two matches in the FIFA Club World Cup.</p>
      <p>One thing that has been confirmed is that BT will become the only UK TV provider to include Amazon Prime Video as part of their packages, with existing BT customers set to receive a free six month Prime Video subscription.</p>
