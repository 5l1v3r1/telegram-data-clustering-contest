      <p>Germany's prized industrial robotics and automation sector is expecting a drop in sales this year for the first time since the global financial crisis, an industry body said on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA) is expecting sales to fall by five percent to 14.3 billion euros ($15.8 billion) this year.</p>
      <p>This would be the first drop since the 32-percent plunge seen in 2009 in the wake of the crisis.</p>
      <p>The slowdown is expected to be even bigger in 2020 when sales are forecast to fall by 10 percent to 12.8 billion eurosâ€”back to the level of 2016.</p>
      <p>"The German robotics and automation sector cannot escape the <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/economic+slowdown/">economic slowdown</a> in the mechanical engineering industry," the group said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The association blamed a slowdown in the <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/global+economy/">global economy</a> and the climate of uncertainty for the car industry, which is having to plough investment into switching to electric amid global trade tensions.</p>
      <p>It also pointed to "saturation effects in important markets", giving as an example the stagnation in worldwide <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/sales/">sales</a> of smartphones that it said was also having an effect on investment in machinery.</p>
      <p>The pessimistic outlook is in line with gloomy forecasts from Germany's powerful BDI industry federation which is predicting a four-percent drop this year in the manufacturing sector, which has been in recession since the third quarter of 2018.</p>
      <p>But Patrick Schwarzkopf, head of VDMA's robotics and automation division, predicted a recovery in the medium-term, saying that "robotics and automation will continue to play a central role in the future and return to its growth course".</p>
