      <p>The woman who apparently inspired <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dolly-parton/">Dolly Parton</a>’s 1973 country-pop banger Jolene probably isn’t too ecstatic about being the subject of one of the Tennessee singer’s biggest hits.</p>
      <p>And, according to the country legend herself, Dolly managed to rub the real Jolene’s face in it just that little bit more when the two managed to awkwardly bump into each other recently.</p>
      <p>Regaling <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jimmy-fallon/">Jimmy Fallon</a> with the tale on The Tonight Show in the US this week, Dolly explained more about the inspiration behind the story in Jolene.</p>
      <p>The singer told the host that it was written about ‘a beautiful redhead’ who worked at a bank near to where Dolly and her husband were living when they first got married.</p>

      <p>‘He was spending more time at the bank than we had money,’ Dolly recalled with a smile. ‘And I thought: “Well, that ain’t gonna work out too good…”‘</p>
      <p>Dolly then claimed that she and the actual Jolene managed to actually run into each other again recently.</p>
      <p>‘Just so you know, I did see the actual Jolene not long ago. She’s not so hot now,’ Dolly said.</p>
      <p>‘She used to have that beautiful red hair, and now she’s grey,’ she added in reference to the lyrics ‘your beauty is beyond compare, with flaming locks of auburn hair’.</p>

      <p>Is the story of Jolene true, though?</p>
      <p>While the bank teller in question may have been the inspiration for the story, Dolly told <a href="https://www.npr.org/2008/10/09/95520570/dolly-partons-jolene-still-haunts-singers?t=1574436017291">NPR</a> in 2008 that she was drawn to the name Jolene by a young autograph hunter she met at one of her shows in the late 1960s.</p>
      <p>‘One night I was on stage, and there was this beautiful little girl — she was probably eight years old at the time,’ Parton recalled.</p>
      <p>‘And she had this beautiful red hair, this beautiful skin, these beautiful green eyes, and she was looking up at me, holding, you know, for an autograph.</p>

      <p>Dolly continued: ‘I said, “Well, you’re the prettiest little thing I ever saw. So what is your name?” And she said, “Jolene.”</p>
      <p>‘And I said, “Jolene. Jolene. Jolene. Jolene… That is pretty. That sounds like a song. I’m going to write a song about that.”‘</p>

      <p>And the rest is country-pop history.</p>
