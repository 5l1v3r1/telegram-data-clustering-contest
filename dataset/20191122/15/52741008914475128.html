      <p>The Kitchener Rangers have swung a trade with Windsor.</p>
      <p>Heading to the Spitfires is defenceman Joseph Rupoli.</p>
      <p>In exchange, the Rangers will receive Guelph's 12th round pick in next year's OHL draft.</p>
      <p>The native of Oakville played in 13 games for Kitchener this season.</p>
      <p>"We would like to thank Joseph for his contributions to our team," general manager Mike McKenzie said in a release. "His personality and work ethic will be missed but we wish him the best of luck in Windsor and life beyond the OHL."</p>
