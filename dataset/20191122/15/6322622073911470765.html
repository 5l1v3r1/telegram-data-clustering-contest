      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 22): The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) has shed light on the resignations of senior executives in the Corporate Finance and Investments (CFI) department.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the regulator said the managing director CFI, Eugene Wong Weng Soon, had in May 2019 informed the SC that he wished to leave the commission upon the completion of his contract in December 2019.</p>
      <p>“After 10 years of service with the SC, Wong believed it was the right time for him to seek new challenges. He had given the SC eight months’ notice to ensure the completion of several major projects,” said the SC.</p>
      <p>“The SC would like to thank Wong for his dedication and contribution to the development of the Malaysian capital market during his tenure with the SC,” said the regulator.</p>
      <p>The SC’s statement was issued to calm speculation on the reason for the departure of two senior executives, namely Wong and Hayati Aman Hashim, general manager (equities) of the CFI division by year-end.</p>
