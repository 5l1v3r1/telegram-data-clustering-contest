      <h1>Floyd Mayweather finally retires from boxing</h1>

      <p>Floyd Mayweather, the former undisputed welterweight champion of the world, has announced that he will not be boxing again.</p>
      <p>His first retirement came in 2007 but he swiftly returned to the ring. He retired again in 2015 after beating Manny Pacquiao but came back two years later to fight Conner McGregor in a match in which Mayweather reportedly bagged $300 million.</p>
      <p>But this time, Mayweather is more concerned about his health now and will rather concentrate on other businesses than fighting.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Reuters, the 42-year-old disclosed that though has received many offers, boxing was too brutal for him now while citing recent demises of boxers.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got calls to get back into the ring, but my health is my wealth. Boxing is a very, very brutal sport. In the last few years a lot of fighters have passed away inside that squared circle,” Mayweather told Reuters.</p>
