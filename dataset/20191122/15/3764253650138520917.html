      <p>But it is not certain if Monaco would want to lose the player they recently bought only if Celta Vigo can meet their asking price.</p>
      <p>Recently, two clubs in Russia - CSKA and Lokomotiv Moscow, were reported to be interested in signing Henry Onyekuru in which Monaco refused to do business with any.</p>
      <p>Henry Onyekuru was among the Super Eagles stars who won bronze medal at the 2019 African Cup of Nations in Egypt.</p>
      <p>He was also among the Super Eagles players who played against Benin and Lesotho in 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifiers.</p>
