        <li>Inter Milan football manager Antonio Conte says he advises his players how to have sex as part of his training regime.</li>
        <li>“I advise my players to have sex for short periods and with the minimum of effort,” <a href="https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Article/Antonio-conte-je-suis-un-esprit-libre-pas-un-leche-cul/1082294">he told L’Equipe.</a> “[And] use positions where they are under their partners.”</li>
        <li>He also joked that he frowns upon extra martial relations because they need “extra action.”</li>
        <li>The Italian’s strange method appears to be working however, with Inter sitting second in the Serie A table having lost just once so far this season.</li>

      <p>Inter Milan manager Antonio Conte says he advises his players how to have sex as part of his training regime.</p>
      <p>The Italian, who took over at the San Siro during the summer, has developed a reputation for his detailed methodologies.</p>
      <p>Cesc Fabregas, who played for him at Chelsea, said he was “meticulous” <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/david-luiz-meticulous-chelsea-coach-antonio-conte-sees-things-others-dont-a3529866.html">according to the Evening Standard.</a></p>
      <p>However, the 50-year-old’s admission that his management techniques extend into the bedrooms of his players is a new, and surprising, insight into the level of detail that he is willing to go to for marginal gains.</p>
      <p>“During the season, I advise my players to have sex for short periods and with the minimum of effort,” <a href="https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Article/Antonio-conte-je-suis-un-esprit-libre-pas-un-leche-cul/1082294">he told L’Equipe.</a></p>
      <p>“[And they] better use positions where they are under their partners. And preferably, with their wives, because if with others, well, that needs extra action.”</p>
      <p>Conte’s intrusive method of man management appears to be working.</p>
      <p>Since the former Juventus and Italy boss took over at Inter, the team has lost just three matches in all competitions, and won 10 of its 12 Serie A games. Inter sits just one point behind league leaders Juventus in the race for the Scudetto.</p>
      <p>Many of the club’s players are thriving under Conte, most notably strike duo Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez, who have scored 17 goals between them this season.</p>
      <p>Lukaku, who has nine of those, moved to Milan in the summer and says he’s delighted to be working for the Italian following his difficult spell at former club Manchester United.</p>
      <p>“My rapport with Conte is very strong, as he is a coach who really helps me,” <a href="https://www.football-italia.net/144448/lukaku-wanted-coach-conte">he told DAZN</a>. “At the age of 26, I want a coach like this, who helps me every day and gives me motivation.</p>
      <p>“I am very happy to be here and to be working with him.”</p>
      <p>Inter next play Torino in Serie A on Saturday, November 23.</p>
