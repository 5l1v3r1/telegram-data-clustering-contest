      <h1>Mel Kiper Names The “Biggest Riser” On His Draft Board</h1>

      <p>The 2019 college football season is nearing the end of the regular season. With the end of the college football season drawing near, NFL draft analysts and scouts are busy finding the next NFL greats.</p>
      <p>After 12 weeks of action, ESPN NFL draft analyst Mel Kiper took to social media to reveal the “biggest riser” on his draft board.</p>
      <p>It should come as no surprise, that Iowa defensive lineman A.J. Epenesa was Kiper’s pick. Epenesa is coming off of a truly dominant performance against Minnesota.</p>
      <p>Here’s what Kiper had to say about the star defensive lineman:</p>
      <blockquote>“The biggest riser on my new Big Board for the 2020 NFL draft — coming next week — is likely to be Iowa defensive end A.J. Epenesa, who was a force against Minnesota with 2.5 sacks and a forced fumble. After a slow start this season, the junior has four sacks in his last three games. At 6-foot-5, 280 pounds, Epenesa’s versatility stands out. He brought edge and inside pressure against the Gophers, and he could be used at defensive tackle in the NFL. The Hawkeyes play Illinois on Saturday.”</blockquote>
      <p>Epenesa was already on track to be a top-20 pick in the 2020 NFL draft, but it looks like he could be moving up.</p>
      <p>Iowa finishes the season with Illinois and Nebraska, which should give Epenesa two more chances to shine.</p>
