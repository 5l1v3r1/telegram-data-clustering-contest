      <p>During an interaction with the audience present there, Big B mentioned that film as a medium transcends borders of language, colour caste and religion. "There are few mediums left like cinema in this fast-paced disintegrating world that can claim such integration.” He expressed hope that we continue to make films that will bring people together.</p>
      <p>The veteran actor shot for his debut film, Saat Hindustani (1969) in Goa, where he played the role of one of the seven satyagrahis, who take on the Portuguese to free the coastal state.</p>
      <p>He also shared his experience of visiting Goa. "Coming to Goa has always been like coming home. My very first film was shot here. And ever since then, I’ve had many opportunities to work in this wonderful place and receive the hospitality from the people of Goa during our various stints of shooting."</p>
