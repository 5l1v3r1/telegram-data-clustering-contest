      <p>The Penticton Indian Band is one step away from declaring its 2017 byelection invalid.</p>
      <p>In a notice posted to Facebook Friday, the band’s current electoral officer Marcus Hadley announced a general band meeting has been set for Dec. 12, at which point members will vote by secret ballot on whether a new byelection should be held. </p>
      <p>The meeting is the last step in the First Nation’s<a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/262988/byelection-appeal-underway"> electoral appeal process</a>, which was forced into motion in August by a <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/262121/pib-loses-federal-ruling">Federal Court ruling</a> on an appeal launched by PIB member Jacqueline McPherson.</p>
      <p>Hadley said the byelection’s participants did not unanimously certify the vote, the first step in the appeal process. The second step required 15 voters to sign a notice of non-confidence, which was submitted to him on Nov. 18.</p>
      <p>Should a majority of members at the Dec. 12 meeting vote in favour of a new byelection, one will be called. </p>
      <p>After a wave of five council resignations in summer 2017, the PIB pushed forward with a byelection to fill the vacant seats — despite calls for an entirely new election from a segment of the community that believed Chief Chad Eneas and the three remaining councillors no longer held a quorum.</p>
      <p>The byelection was managed by Julia Buck, in-house legal counsel for the Westbank First Nation. The PIB had brought her in after dismissing longtime electoral officer Valerie Baptiste in an effort to eliminate the perception of bias. </p>
      <p>Fred Kruger, Joan Philip, Inez Pierre, Ernest Jack and Kyle Alec were elected, although Alec has since stepped down. </p>
      <p>McPherson, representing other community members, attempted to appeal the byelection by lodging a formal complaint with the electoral officer within 30 days of the vote. Buck refused to accept the appeal, but the Federal Court ruled she should have and let the appeal proceed. </p>
      <p>McPherson's complaints start at the dismissal of Valerie Baptiste and the appointment of Buck, who she argued was not able to hold the position of electoral officer as she is not a PIB member. Electoral officers hold a tie-breaking vote. The appeal also alleged “numerous” errors with the ballots and nomination process and failure to locate and contact off-reserve members prior to the vote.</p>
