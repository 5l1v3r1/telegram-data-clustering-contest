      <p>Travellers have once again set up camp in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> .</p>
      <p>A convoy of caravans appeared in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/ainsdale">Ainsdale</a> at the weekend - before moving to the Esplanade in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/birkdale">Birkdale</a> .</p>
      <p>Such illegal encampments are becoming a frequent occurrence for the resort town.</p>

      <p>In June of this year, a group of travellers pitched up on Tulketh Street - just days after a group of seven caravans and associated vehicles parked up at the derelict <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/residents-livid-after-travellers-set-16115873">Park and Ride site in Kew</a> without a permit.</p>
      <p>Figures obtained from a Freedom Of Information request last year showed travellers set up camp <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/travellers-illegally-setting-up-camp-15109998">more than once a month</a> in Sefton.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> understands the convoy of caravans and other vehicles has been in situ near Victoria Park since Wednesday.</p>

      <p>A number of people living in the town have had their say.</p>
      <p>Russell Kingsmill said: "I hope they have paid for their parking. One rule for one and another for another."</p>
      <p>Tania Hibbert said: "It's about time they put barriers up [at the car park]."</p>
      <p>Gerald Winnard said: "This reoccurring problem needs sorting out. I for one am sick of paying taxes to clean up mess left behind."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Sefton Council said: "Sefton Council is aware that a number of vehicles and caravans were parked illegally at a site in Ainsdale and have since moved to another part of the borough.</p>
      <p>" <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/sefton-council">Sefton Council</a> is now following the correct legal procedures as set down in legislation to remove the vehicles.‚Äù</p>
