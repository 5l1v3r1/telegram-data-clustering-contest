      <p>Shocking footage has captured the dramatic moment a lorry bulldozes through a level crossing seconds before it closes.</p>
      <p>The video shows the vehicle plough through a barrier in the West Midlands - resulting in travel chaos across the region.</p>
      <p>Fire crews from Kidderminster were sent to the scene just before 10am this morning (Friday, November 22). The incident has since been left in the hands of Network Rail.</p>
      <p>No injuries have been reported but the windscreen of the van was damaged as a result of the collision.</p>
      <p>The scene was littered with debris and engineers are working to reattach the broken barrier.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Watch the video above to see the dramatic moment.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Trains are able to run through at a reduced speed until the work has been completed but passengers have been advised to expect delays for the rest of the day, particularly between Kidderminster and Stourbridge.</p>

      <p>A fault with the signalling system is also causing travel chaos between Birmingham Moor Street and Birmingham Snow Hill.</p>
      <p>Signalling engineers are currently on site working to rectify this issue but National Rail has warned trains may be cancelled, delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.</p>
      <p>Passengers are urged to check West Midlands Railway or National Rail before travel.</p>
