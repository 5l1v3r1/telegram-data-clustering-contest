      <h1>Next-Generation Genesis G80 Has A Big Secret</h1>
      <h2>This will be unlike any previous Genesis model.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:55:33+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Rosenholtz</a></address>
      <p>Genesis has been spotted <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/2020-genesis-g80-spied-with-gv80-concept-styling-cues">testing a camouflaged version</a> of its next-generation G80 sedan, which was initially slated to be revealed around now. But Genesis has reportedly been forced to <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/theres-bad-news-about-the-new-genesis-g80">push back the release date</a> as the company finalizes its new 2.5-liter and 3.5-liter turbocharged engines.</p>
      <p>As we wait for the conventional gas-engined G80 models to be announced, <a href="https://thekoreancarblog.com/2019/11/19/genesis-g80-to-be-brands-first-electric-vehicle/">The Korean Car Blog</a> has spotted another G80 test mule out on the road, but this one is unlike any other Genesis model we've seen before. The test mule in question was spotted at a charging station, prompting KCB to assume it was a new plug-in hybrid model.</p>

      <p>Genesis will likely introduce a PHEV variant of the third-generation G80 but it will also be the brand's first fully electric vehicle. The standard G80 should arrive in 2020 with the EV version not expected to be revealed until 2021. Very little is known about the EV powertrain or the PHEV for that matter, but the base 2.5-liter four-cylinder model is expected to produce around 286 to 300 horsepower going out through an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission. The larger 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 engine should deliver around 400 hp.</p>
      <p>On the exterior, we expect the G80 to look like the rendering pictured above with styling cues taken from the GV80 Concept. This will be a new look for the Genesis brand accented by a split-headlight and taillight design and triangular grille. We will first get to see this new look on the<a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/official-radical-genesis-g90-facelift-coming-to-la-auto-show"> refreshed G90 sedan</a>.</p>

      <p>Under the skin, the G80 will likely lose weight in the next generation using a lighter platform. We have no guesses on how much power the EV or PEHV drivetrains will produce but the weight reduction should help both variants improve their efficiency. Along with the new G80, Genesis will soon reveal its first SUV model, the GV80, followed by a second, smaller SUV called the GV70.</p>
