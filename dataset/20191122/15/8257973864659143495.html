      <p>Nov. 22 (UPI) -- Jerry Sandusky, the former Pennsylvania State University assistant <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/John_Walker/?tps=1">football</a> coach who was convicted in 2012 for sexually abusing 10 boys, will be resentenced Friday.</p>
      <p>The case, which led to the Penn State's football team being stripped of scholarships and banned from bowl games for several years, designated the longtime coach as a violent sexual predator.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://fox43.com/2019/11/22/jerry-sandusky-to-get-new-sentence-on-45-child-sex-abuse-charges-today/">initially was sentenced</a> to 30 to 60 years in prison on 45 counts, but an appeals court in Pennsylvania ruled the sentencing unconstitutional. A <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Superior_Court/?tps=1">Superior Court</a> also ruled in February the mandatory minimums in the case were not properly applied.</p>
      <p>Sandusky's current attorney, Al Lindsay, said in February that he hopes the hearing would lead to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/05/us/jerry-sandusky-re-sentenced/index.html">reduced sentence</a> for his client. Courts in the past have repeatedly denied Sandusky a new trial on those counts, though.</p>
      <p>"He's disappointed, but we're in for the long haul with this, and Jerry understands that it's going to be a long fight," Lindsay said the denial of a new trial and resentencing at the Centre County Courthouse.</p>
      <p>The hearing threatens to overshadow one of the high points of the Penn State football program's re-emergence after crippling NCAA sanctions from Sandusky's 2012 case. The 9-1 Nittany Lions, ranked No. 9 in the latest polls, play No. 2 Ohio State (10-0) Saturday with an outside shot at entering the national championship playoff picture.</p>
