      <h1>Samsung is preparing improved 8K TV upscaling tech for CES 2020 lineup</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:58:54+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:58</time> by <a rel="author">Mihai M.</a></address>
      <p>Samsung Electronics is reportedly making advancements in its AI-based upscaling technology for <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/8k-tv/">8K TVs</a>. The company wants to apply deep learning AI-based upscaling to all of its future 8K TV models planned for release next year. It could also prepare the technology in anticipation of a future microLED TV lineup which may not be part of <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/the-wall/">The Wall</a> series, said to be unveiled at <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/ces-2020/">CES 2020</a>.</p>
      <p>This bit of news comes from Korean news outlet <a href="https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2019&amp;no=973273"><i>Pulse</i> </a>citing principal engineers Ahn Tae-gyoung and Park Seung-ho of Samsung Electronics Visual Display Business Division.</p>
      <h3>Deep learning-based 8K upscaling to become the next best thing</h3>
      <p>Samsung has been using machine learning-based upscaling tech <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsungs-q9s-85-inch-qled-tv-upscales-any-content-to-8k-using-artificial-intelligence/">for a couple of years now</a>, but the company continues to improve its solution and deep-learning AI should push this concept to the next level. As detailed in <a href="https://skymind.ai/wiki/ai-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-learning">this paper</a>, deep learning is a subset of machine learning and provides higher accuracy, particularly in image and sound recognition.</p>
      <p>Upscaling has become a vital component of modern high-resolution TVs because they’ve advanced much faster than broadcasting technology. Broadcasting in 8K resolutions isn’t really a thing yet, but Samsung leverages AI to upscale 1080p or even lower-quality content to 4K and 8K resolutions on its TVs.</p>
      <p>Are you in the market for a new Samsung TV? If so, will you take advantage of the holiday shopping season and hope to buy one at a discount, or will you wait until after CES 2020 to see what this improved upscaling technology is all about? Leave a comment below.</p>
