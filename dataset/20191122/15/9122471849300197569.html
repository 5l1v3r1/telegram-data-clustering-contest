      <h1>Minnesota at Northwestern: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:59:20+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Last weekend, the Minnesota Golden Gophers suffered their <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/iowa-hawkeyes/iowa-footballs-tweet-after-win-vs-minnesota-is-going-viral">first loss of the season to the Iowa Hawkeyes</a>. Although there’s still an outside chance they make the College Football Playoff, they must be perfect from here on out.</p>
      <p>Minnesota was riding high off its statement win over Penn State, before losing against Iowa. Now, all eyes will be on how P.J. Fleck’s team responds to adversity this weekend.</p>
      <p>The Golden Gophers still have plenty of reasons to be motivated this Saturday. Not only could they inch closer to winning the Big Ten West, they could win their seventh conference game of the regular season –  something the program hasn’t accomplished.</p>
      <p>Northwestern has been disappointing this season, but the Wildcats are coming off a win over the UMass Minutemen.</p>
      <p>Judging off the current betting line, oddsmakers aren’t expecting an upset in Evanston, Illinois.</p>

      <p>This game is extremely important for Minnesota to prove to the rest of college football that it’s a legitimate threat in the Big Ten.</p>
      <p>With a marquee matchup against Wisconsin looming large next weekend, it’s imperative that Minnesota isn’t caught looked ahead.</p>
