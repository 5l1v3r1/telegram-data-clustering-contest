      <p>Guinea-Bissau’s festive campaign motorcades have collided with the dread many voters are feeling ahead of presidential polls, which unfold in the coup-ridden West African country on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Sweeping through the capital Bissau during the campaign, the convoys blare the names of the candidates through loudspeakers, while giant election banners adorn buildings.</p>
      <p>“The problems are going to start after the election. It’s a very bad time that frightens me,” said Lino Correa, 20, a high-school student.</p>
      <p>Guinea-Bissau has suffered four coups and a string of political assassinations since independence from Portugal in 1974.</p>
      <p>The latest coup, in 2012, occurred during presidential elections.</p>
      <p>But health, safety and the dire state of the small country’s economy were also top concerns for voters interviewed by AFP.</p>
      <p>The 12 candidates — all men — contesting the election face a country mired in poverty and endemic corruption.</p>
      <p>Cashews are the top official export, but Guinea-Bissau has become better known for its drugs trade, with Latin American cocaine runners exploiting its instability to use it as a transit point to Europe.</p>
      <p>“I earn 30,000 CFA francs ($50, 45 euros) a day,” said taxi driver Thierno Malang Gomis, 35.</p>
      <p>He said he had only 3,500 francs ($6, five euros) left after paying for fuel and servicing his car loan.</p>
      <p>“If it’s not the cashew-harvest period, it’s really difficult,” Malang Gomis said.</p>
      <p>More than a third of Guinea-Bissau’s 1.8 million inhabitants live on less than $1 (90 euro cents) a day. And the elites, according to experts, have systematically stolen the country’s wealth.</p>
      <p>Incumbent president Jose Mario Vaz, 62, has vowed to turn the tables on the old order if he wins.</p>
      <p>Under the shade of mango and cheese trees in a suburb of Bissau on Wednesday, he said he would refuse to “play the game of a little group of people who plunder and steal public funds”.</p>
      <p>Vaz is the first president in 25 years to complete his mandate without being ousted or assassinated.</p>
      <p>His longtime political rival Domingos Simoes Pereira, who is also running, has made similar pledges.</p>
      <p>Sitting inside the banner-draped party headquarters, Dan Yala, one of his campaign staffers, said Pereira would “look after vulnerable populations”, pay unpaid public workers and attract investors.</p>
      <p>A recent report from the Institute for Security Studies, a think tank, noted that the losing presidential candidates risk not only their political careers but “being pursued for economic crimes they may have committed”.</p>
      <p><b>Political deadlock </b><br/>Many of the current electoral favourites have been key players in the near-permanent political crisis that has gripped Guinea-Bissau since 2015.</p>
      <p>Vaz came to power in 2014 to hopes that he would restore stability to the country.</p>
      <p>However, his sacking of then prime minister Pereira in 2015 precipitated years of clashes with the parliament over his choices to lead the government. A political deadlock has persisted ever since.</p>
      <p>Pereira heads the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), which won parliamentary elections in March. The PAIGC began as a Marxist-Leninist movement that fought for an end to Portuguese rule.</p>
      <p>Vaz is running for president as an independent after being expelled from the party.</p>
      <p>Carlos Gomes Junior — a former prime minister ousted in the 2012 coup — is also running.</p>
      <p>Both Vaz and Pereira have pledged to respect the election results. However, the incumbent president has said he would only do so “if it is transparent and without tampering”.</p>
      <p>Days before the election, concerns about electoral irregularities are widespread. Polling stations have yet to receive voter lists, raising the possibility of fraud.</p>
      <p>Neighbouring West African states, traditional mediators in Guinea-Bissau’s internecine politics, have sent in electoral observers.</p>
      <p>Even a peaceful transfer of power may not break the deadlock if a candidate from outside the PAIGC wins and is again at loggerheads with the majority party in parliament.</p>
      <p>Some 700,000 voters are registered for Sunday, with indicative results due early next week.</p>
      <p>A second-round run-off — planned for December 29 — is considered highly likely due to the number of candidates.</p>
