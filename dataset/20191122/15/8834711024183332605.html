      <h1>Patrice Motsepe Now Owns 37% Of The Blue Bulls</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:09:34+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/suzziegitau/" target="_blank">SG Editor</a></address>
      <p>The Blue Bulls Company have on Friday announced Mamelodi Sundowns owner Patrice Motsepe as their new shareholder.</p>
      <p>Bulls confirmed that the deal was unanimously concluded on Thursday at a meeting held at Loftus Versfeld.</p>
      <p>The new structure will mean that existing shareholders Remgro and the Blue Bulls Rugby Union (BBRU) reduce their previously equal percentage of shareholding from 50% each to 37% and 26% respectively, allowing Motsepe to buy in the remaining 37%.</p>
      <p>“We put a lot of effort into making this possible over the last few months, and I am proud to say that all the union committee members unanimously voted in favour of the deal. I firmly believe that private investors will add immense value to our beautiful game going forward,” said President of the BBRU Willem Strauss.</p>
      <p>“The benefits of this deal is not only to the BBCo at the professional level it will also make a positive impact on our amateur rugby, at schools, clubs and development levels. We are privileged and excited to have partners like Mr Motsepe in our corner.”</p>
      <p>Alfons Meyer, CEO of the BBCo added: “This is a brilliant deal, not only for us at the BBCo, but also for our communities and the sports industry in general. I look forward to a host of synergies and opportunities that will be forged between us. With Mr Motsepe also owning soccer giants Mamelodi Sundowns, there is no doubt that a relationship like this will further enhance and entrench our vision to make Tshwane the sporting capital.”</p>
