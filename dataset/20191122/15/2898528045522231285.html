      <h1>ONE: Edge of Greatness results, videos: Colbey Northcutt victorious in debut</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:23:02+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:23</time> by <a rel="author">Guilherme Cruz, https://facebook.com/guicruzmma/</a></address>
      <p>Colbey Northcutt had no problem winning her ONE Championship debut Friday morning in Singapore.</p>
      <p>The older sister of <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3363/sage-northcutt">Sage Northcutt</a> entered the ONE ring for the first time to take on Putri Padmi in a flyweight bout at Singapore Indoor Stadium. Northcutt hurt Padmi on the feet in the first exchanges before her opponent shot for a takedown. Northcutt immediately went for a guillotine choke, transitioning for multiple armbar and triangle choke attempts that were well defended by Padmi.</p>
      <p>Northcutt and Padmi did not go to the ground during rounds two and three, but Northcutt was smart to use her huge height and reach advantage to stay on the outside and out-strike Padmi for the last 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>The karate specialist did not get close to finishing Padmi on the feet, but did enough to secure a clear unanimous decision victory. Northcutt now holds a 1-1 record as a professional MMA fighter, with Padmi dropping to 0-2.</p>

      <p>Headlining the MMA portion of the show, former ONE lightweight title contenders Amir Khan and Ev Ting battled in an action-packed three-round contest. In the end, Singapore-native Khan snapped an uncomfortable three-fight skid with a close split decision victory.</p>
      <p>The card featured nice finishes by former ONE Championship strawweight titleholders <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2984/dejdamrong-sor-amnuaysirichoke">Dejdamrong Sor Amnuaysirichoke</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2188/alex-silva">Alex Silva</a>.</p>
      <p>Amnuaysirichoke, the first strawweight champion in ONE history, bounced back from a first-round loss to Li Tao Miao in May by stopping Muhammad Imran via third-round TKO.</p>

      <p>Silva, who held strawweight gold between 2017 and 2018, tapped Peng Xue Wen with an armbar late in round two. “Little Rock” now holds a 9-5 record with five of his wins coming by way of armbar.</p>
