        <b>Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) is joining forces with Western University on a programme exploring the ethical and social aspects of data analysis and AI.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The bank is pumping $3 million into the RBC Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence project at the Ontario university as part of what it calls its commitment to Canada's technology talent ecosystem and preparing future leaders for the AI and data-centric future.<br/><br/>In addition to two courses, the partnership sees RBC set up two scholarship funds in data science and software engineering, available to third year students in relevant subjects. Meanwhile, a "design thinking program" available to all students will see successful applicants get a stipend and the chance for an RBC internship.<br/><br/>Bruce Ross, group head, technology and operations, RBC, says: “Artificial intelligence and data science are transforming our world today, and we see a huge opportunity to partner with Western, a leading university, to prepare the next generation of talent with the knowledge, skills and experiences needed to drive that success.”<br/><br/>RBC recently backed an academic research project using AI to address climate change and is also working with an Israeli-based university spin off to support the development of AI-based cybersecurity techniques.<br/><br/>Earlier this week, Scotiabank donated $1.25 million to support AI research at University of Alberta. It also recently introduced a programme to give senior employees a grasp of the ethical principles involved in using AI.</p>
