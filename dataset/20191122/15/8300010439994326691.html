      <p>KANNAPOLIS, N.C. -- A North Carolina church is drawing attention after creating a sign offering support to President Trump in light of his impeachment hearings.<br/><br/>Pastor Tim B. Jones is at the center of the controversy after posting a sign at Resurrection Baptist Church that reads "TRYING 2 IMPEACH JESUS TOO! WONT HAPPEN EITHER!"<br/><br/>On Facebook, Jones called the sign "worth reading" and a "Truth Bomb!" Several Facebook friends commended him for the sign in the comments.<br/><br/>Jones <a href="https://www.wbtv.com/2019/11/20/trying-impeach-jesus-too-nc-church-making-news-again-controversial-sign/">told WBTV</a> the effort to impeach Trump is part of a broader movement to phase out Christianity. The sign is the church's response to that.<br/><br/>"Somebody asked me if I thought that God ordained him to be in office and I do believe that with all my heart," Jones said. "I think that our voice has been taken away, and I think it's time to stand up. If it takes my sign to draw some awareness to it, then that's fine."<br/><br/>In 2016, the church sign read 'WE ARE VOTING, AND NOT FOR HILLARY!"<br/><br/>"I started thinking about the society that we're in and how it's pretty much Godless," Jones said. "I thought they're trying to impeach a president that they're not happy won an election. What's the difference? They're trying to take God out of everything as well."<br/><br/>The church is in Kannapolis, around 30 miles north of Charlotte.</p>
