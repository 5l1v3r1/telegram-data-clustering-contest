      <p>Brooks Macdonald has bought Edinburgh-based wealth manager Cornelian for up to £39m and has this afternoon sealed a £30m share placing to fund the deal.</p>
      <p>In an update to the stock market this morning, Brooks Macdonald said it would pay an initial £31m for the company – £22m in cash and £9m in shares – with a further £8m cash available if Cornelian meets certain performance targets.</p>

      <p>“Cornelian Asset Managers is an excellent cultural fit with Brooks Macdonald,” said Brooks chief executive Caroline Connellan.</p>
      <p>The AIM-listed wealth manager reported full-year growth ahead of expectations in September, in a rare glimmer of hope for a sector that has struggled to stem the flow of client outflows. It completed the first round of a cost-cutting drive earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Brooks’ purchase of Cornelian, which had £1.4bn funds under management at the end of September, is due to complete in the first quarter of 2020 subject to regulatory approval.</p>
      <p>Brooks Macdonald’s share price fell 1.92 per cent following the news to 1,770p.</p>
      <p>The company confirmed the placing had raised gross proceeds of approximately £30m at a share price of 1,775p per share.</p>
      <p>Caroline Connellan, Chief Executive of Brooks Macdonald, commented: “We are pleased by the support and interest shown in the placing and we are committed to delivering sustainable value enhancing growth for all shareholders.”</p>
      <p>Corneilain chief executive Jeremy Richardson said the firm was “very pleased to be joining Brooks Macdonald” and had been impressed by its “strong client focus and growth aspirations”.</p>
      <p>“It was important to us to find a company with a similar culture and investment philosophy,” he continued, “and critically one that we were confident would provide the highest levels of service to our clients and intermediary supporters.”</p>

      <p>“From the outset of our discussions with Cornelian, we have been struck by the complementary cultures, investment processes and business models of the two firms,” said Connellan.</p>
      <p>“The transaction creates value for our shareholders and crucially will provide benefits for both firms’ clients and the intermediaries with whom we work. The acquisition of Cornelian is a significant step forward in our medium-term strategy of delivering sustainable, value-enhancing growth.”</p>
