      <p>eBay already has <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/e/special-events/black-friday-g?_trkparms=pageci%3Ae865c6d2-0d20-11ea-9ad5-74dbd180aa4c%7Cparentrq%3A9304386c16e0a6882bc78435ffea4840%7Ciid%3A1">Black Friday discounts</a> going on right now, but today the auction-centric retailer has announced that it will be knocking an extra five per cent off all tech products - even if those products have already been discounted.</p>
      <p>All you need to do to claim this discount is purchase some tech, then use the code <b>PICKME5</b> during the checkout process.</p>
      <p>Obviously this being eBay there are plenty of T&amp;Cs that you need to be aware of before you try and claim your money off. The main one is that this deal is only available until 9am on Monday 25th November. You also have to spend at least £50 to qualify, and the maximum discount you can claim is £50. So if five per cent of your order is £55, you'll still only get £50 off.</p>
      <p>Still money off is money off, and here are a few deals you can enjoy once you use the code:</p>
