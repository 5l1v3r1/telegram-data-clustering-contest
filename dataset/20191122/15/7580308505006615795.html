      <p>The Lagos State House of Assembly has suspended the chairman of Ifako-Ijaiye Local Government, Oloruntoba Oke for administrative incompetence and financial recklessness.</p>
      <p>The House also ordered the redeployment of the council-manager, treasurer and engineer.</p>
      <p>The Assembly, therefore, directed the Vice Chairman, Mr Usman Hamzat of the Council to take over immediately.</p>
      <p>This followed the resolution of the House after taken the report of the five-man Ad-Hoc committee on the investigation of Ifako-Ijaye Local government. </p>
      <p>According to the Committee Chairman, Rotimi Olowo, the investigation followed the petition of concerned residents of the council.</p>
      <p>The chairman revealed that despite getting loan and payment forthwith, the work done such as roads and construction of secretariat were not commensurate to the projects executed.</p>
      <p>It was also disclosed that the loan of N350 million taken in 2012 during Oke’s first term in office was not appropriately expended.</p>
      <p>The House pointed out that Oke also failed to abide by the administrative guidelines stipulated by the State Assembly in 2011.</p>
      <p>In his comment, the Deputy Majority Leader, Muyiwa Jimoh said, the error created was as a result of the bureaucracy in local government and failed to abide by the administrative guidelines set up by the House.</p>
      <p>He, therefore, stated that “the council-manager, treasurer and engineers should also be affected.”</p>
      <p>Abiodun Tobun noted that, “from this report, we have observed the heads of the council were working at variance with the law of the council.</p>
      <p>“The council supposed to work in compliance with the State government in making dividends of democracy available to the people,” Tobun said.</p>
      <p>Bisi Yusuff explained that, “the recommendations of the committee will make some of those who feel untouchable to sit tight.”</p>
      <p>He added that as a member of the Committee and a former chairman of a council, “I’m in support of making one as a scapegoat to serve as a deterrent to others.”</p>
      <p>In his argument, the Majority Leader, Sanai Agunbiade stated that the recommendations of the Committee were predicated on the fact that “the councillors had already passed a vote of no confidence on the Chairman.”</p>
      <p>The second aspect of the recommendations according to Agunbiade was the comments of the residents of the area.</p>
