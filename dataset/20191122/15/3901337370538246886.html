      <h1>Reader’s Voice: It’s Time For Bvuma To Step Up!</h1>

      <p>In the absence of regular goalkeepers Itumeleng Khune and Daniel Akpeyi, fans feel that this weekend’s Telkom Knockout semi-final against Maritzburg United is the perfect opportunity for Bruce Bvuma to stake his claim.</p>
      <p>With Khune out and Akpeyi suspended, the onus is on 24-year-old Bvuma to help guide Amakhosi to a TKO final berth, where either Mamelodi Sundowns or Golden Arrows lay in wait.</p>

      <p>SL Supporter @ Ofentse Kakapa Mahatlhe feels there is only one way for the Bafana international to silence the haters.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“For Bvuma to do well, he needs to perform tremendously in disbelief of his haters. That's all I can say to this young man! He must step up, the way he did, against @ChippaUnited on the 6th of this November month! Whereby, no one gave him any chance to deliver! But guess what was the outcome of that particular game, a clean sheet</i>
        <i>! Whether it is Itu Khune or Bruce Bvuma in goal, we'll march on to the @TelkomFinal!</i>
      </p>
      <p>He is not the only one who feels it is time for Bvuma to come of age. SL Supporter @Mestabenefeet feels that he needs to eliminate silly errors from his game.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Bvuma must pull up his socks. He commits the same errors as Akpeyi, one day they are good and next boom, they surprise you with some silly and costly mistakes.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Despite the doubts surrounding Bvuma, SL Supporter @ T4_MORE is more concerned about the absence of key figure Erick Mathoho in the heart of the Amakhosi defense.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“While Bvuma will have to up his game, I’m more worried about Tower’s suspension, but with quality players we have, anyone from the bench can rise to the occasion.”</i>
      </p>
