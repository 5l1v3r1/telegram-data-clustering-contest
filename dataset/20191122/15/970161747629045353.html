      <h1>Queen shows support to Prince Andrew as they ride horses together in Windsor</h1>

      <p>The Queen has been seen out with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> for the first time since she effectively sacked him.</p>
      <p>The monarch and her ‘favourite son’ were pictured riding together in the grounds of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/windsor-castle/">Windsor Castle</a> earlier today.</p>
      <p>The pair were covered to protect from themselves from the rain on the Berkshire estate and accompanied by two equerries.</p>
      <p>The Duke and his mother regularly ride horses together but the image is likely to be seen as a very public show of support towards her embattled son.</p>

      <p>The monarch and her heir, Prince Charles, are believed to have forced Andrew to stand down in the wake of the Jeffrey Epstein paedophile scandal.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The Duke has repeatedly maintained he did not have sex with one of the financier’s ‘slaves’ when she was 17.</p>
      <p>But he came under intense after a ‘car crash’ BBC interview in which he failed to show sympathy for the victims and defended his friendship with Epstein.</p>
      <p>Charles – who is currently on a tour of New Zealand – is believed to have personally stepped in and persuaded his mother that Andrew could no longer continue royal duties.</p>
      <p>The final straw was said to have been when the question ‘is the monarch fit for purpose’ formed part of the General Election debate.</p>

      <p>The Queen is said to have summoned Andrew to Buckingham Palace on Wednesday and demanded he step down from public duties.</p>
      <p>The eighth-in-line to the throne was told he could write his own statement in an attempt to allow him to bow out gracefully.</p>
      <p>A source told the Daily Mail: ‘When the Queen and the Prince of Wales stand firm together they are a pretty formidable combination in terms of getting things done.’</p>
      <p>The wider Royal Family were informed and the Duke put out a statement just before 6pm on Wednesday announcing his departure.</p>
      <p>Since then, Outward Bound, the University of Huddersfield and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra have announced they are parting company with him.</p>
      <p>Yesterday Buckingham Palace said he would still be involved in Pitch@Palace because it was a private venture.</p>

      <p>The Duke was said to have been planning to go to Bahrain this weekend for an event but a furious Charles is reported to have stepped in and forced him to cancel the trip.</p>
      <p>A source said: ‘He was persuaded by his family that it was not a good idea in light of this week’s events.’</p>

      <p>The Duke of York has long been rumoured to be the Queen’s favourite and he was named after Prince Philip’s father Prince Andrew of Greece.</p>
      <p>A year earlier the Queen and Philip were said to have gone through a ‘rocky patch’ and Andrew’s birth marked a fresh start for the family.</p>
      <p>He has appeared in public a handful of times since stepping back from royal life and is said to be remaining upbeat.</p>
      <p>His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, with whom he still lives, was all smiles when she arrived at Buckingham Palace yesterday while his daughters <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/going-pay-beatrice-eugenie-prince-andrew-sacked-11199634/">Beatrice and Eugenie</a> have also been attending events.</p>
      <p>A source told the Mail: ‘Despite everything the duke is getting a lot of support. The entrepreneurs he helps have been tremendously sweet and kind.</p>
      <p>‘This really feels like a witch-hunt. He’d been hounded about this since 2011 non-stop. So he’s very positive about it<br/>actually.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘He can concentrate on clearing his name.’</p>
      <p>The crisis is far from over, however, as the BBC is set to air an interview next week with Virginia Roberts.</p>
      <p>She has claimed she was sex trafficked by Epstein and had sex with Andrew three times.</p>
