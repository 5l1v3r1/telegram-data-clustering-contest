      <p>Nov. 22 (UPI) -- Stephen Colbert spoofed the <i>Lord of the Rings </i>character Aragorn during Thursday's episode of <i>The Late Show</i>.</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old late-night host and comedian played Darrylgorn, the "twin brother" of Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), in a fake<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEKinNoUMas"> trailer</a> he created for <i>Lord of the Rings </i>and <i>The Hobbit</i> director Peter Jackson.</p>
      <p>Colbert had a real cameo as "Laketown spy" in <i>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug</i>. He pitched a film series about Darrylgorn to Jackson while visiting the director in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>"What about this for a backstory? My character is actually Aragorn's slightly hotter twin brother, Darrylgorn," Colbert suggested. "I think it's kind of believable because a lot of people go, when I'm walking around the streets in New York, 'Are you Viggo Mortensen?' I go, 'No, I'm not.' They go, 'Viggo, stop messing with us.'"</p>
      <p>Colbert wore a long, wavy wig and a hooded cloak to play Darrylgorn in the trailer.</p>
      <p>"I can't tell you from whence I came or what my errand may be. Know only this -- I am called the Laketown Spy," Colbert says as Darrylgorn. "Mayhapth you recognize my visage from <i>The Desolation of Smaug</i>."</p>
      <p>"Legends hold that Aragorn had an even more ruggedly handsome identical twin. And who might that be?" he adds. "I am Darrylgorn."</p>
      <p>Jackson appears in the end of the trailer as Darrylgorn's loyal servant "Gratuitous of Cameo."</p>
      <p>The <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>The Hobbit</i> trilogies are based on the J.R.R. Tolkien novels. Jackson<a href="https://ew.com/article/2012/10/26/peter-jackson-stephen-colbert-hobbit/"> told Entertainment Weekly</a> in 2012 that he had "never met a bigger Tolkien geek" than Colbert.</p>
      <p>"Philippa Boyens is our resident Tolkien expert, and when Stephen came down to visit the set, we put him head to head with Philippa on a Tolkien quiz -- and Stephen triumphed," the director said. "I have to say his encyclopedic knowledge of Tolkien is spectacular, and points to a deprived childhood in some respects."</p>
      <p>Amazon is developing a <i>Lord of the Rings</i> series that takes place in Middle-earth in the Second Age. The studio <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2019/11/19/Lord-of-the-Rings-Amazon-renews-series-ahead-of-premiere/3611574177631/">renewed the show</a> this week ahead of its premiere.</p>
