      <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener took a break from his usual political duties on Thursday to clear the ice on a mini Zamboni-like ice resurfacer at San Francisco's Civic Center rink.</p>
      <p>Sen. Wiener <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_wiener/status/1197594100460994562?s=21">posted a video</a> of his whirl around the ice and the footage of a very tall man on a very small machine is making many on Twitter smile.</p>
      <p>"With a zamboni added to your height, you are now the most easy to spot politician ever," tweeted @kurtisnelson.</p>
      <p>The whirl around the ice was a test run for the opening ceremony at 11 a.m. Friday when the senator will drive the ice resurfacer through a ribbon. The 1.5-horsepower machine made by Ice Rink Supply can reach a top speed of seven miles per hour and is sure to do the job.</p>
      <p>"With all the intensity of politics today, sometimes it's nice to do normal community things like open a winter ice-skating rink and give people something fun to do and recognize that even with all he political craziness it's important to enjoy life," Sen. Wiener told SFGATE.</p>

      <p>Sen. Wiener said clearing the ice was fun and the machine was surprisingly stable, unlike ice skates.</p>
      <p>"I'm not a real ice skater," he said. "That would definitely create a risk of making a fool of myself."</p>
      <p>The T-Mobile Winter Park at 355 McAllister St. is modeled after an ice skating rink in Austria. In its second year, the rink has a skating path traveling through a lighted tree forest. The feature has been expanded this year.</p>
