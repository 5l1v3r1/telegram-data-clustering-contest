        <b>The Fortnite Champion Series for Chapter 2 has been far from perfect. Epic has addressed an issue with players losing points.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s no secret that the Fortnite Champion Series (FNCS) has had its issues. Epic had to delay the tournament for week two, which eventually led to some players unable to complete all of their games.</p>
      <p>Week three featured teams losing a player before the match started. They couldn’t leave to get their teammate back and wouldn’t be awarded any points for the games they played without them.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Understandably, a lot of players were dissatisfied with Epic after this happened. They felt discouraged or outright cheated if a chunk of their points were missing at the end of the competition.</p>

      <p>Epic stayed silent on this issue for several days, which fanned the flames of those who were complaining. Finally, three days after the week-three finals, Epic posted a blog addressing the problem.</p>
      <ul>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the blog, the Fortnite competitive team stated that they are “beginning the process of manually correcting all point issues that occurred during the FNCS Weekly Finals (Round 3) of each region due to this issue.”</p>

      <p>The blog also announced that, while the corrected stats may affect who qualifies for the Season Finals, Epic won’t be removing any prize money from those who qualified under the false results.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>“We are continuing to monitor the issue and are working toward a resolution,” <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/news/abandon-match-issues-in-fncs">the team wrote.</a> “In the meantime, if you run into this issue, please submit feedback via the in-game settings with the text ‘!missing squad.'”</p>
      <p>It’s good to see that Epic finally broke their silence on this issue. They need to reestablish goodwill with the competitive community after a bug-filled tournament and a lack of communication.</p>
