      <p>Sangita quits the show and takes home Rs 6,40,000. Big B introduces a child Rudra, who is suffering from blood cancer and is getting her treatment done in Mumbai hospital. Karamveer Purnota Dutta Bahl talks about the importance of nutrition for getting the right treatment and fighting against the disease. Big B welcomes her on KBC. She is known for providing nutrition to underprivileged children suffering from cancer in Government and charitable hospitals through her foundation. The Cuddles Foundation launched a capacity-building program that focuses on the needs to fight cancer in children and provided them with the best advice and care.</p>
      <p>Purnota said: “Firstly, I would like to reiterate that children’s cancer can be cured, so if you have the slightest of doubt that your child is unwell, please take them to a medical personnel. Also, Cuddle’s foundation has acquired success because most people in our organisation are medical professionals. People have wrong notion that people who work in NGOs don’t do well financially. The fact is that you can lead a comfortable life even while working for not-for-profits organisation.</p>
      <p>“In today’s time, India needs more professionals to come forward and help us with these causes. Also, many children take medical treatment, but do not focus on nutrition which is also required for them to build immunity and fight the disease.”</p>

      <p>Big B welcomes actor Emraan Hashmi on KBC and talks about his son Ayaan suffering from cancer and his struggles during the tough times. In 2016, he launched an autobiographical book called “The Kiss of Life”. Through this book, he extensively talks about guidelines, nutritional planning, hospital procedures and the power to fight cancer. “I have been following Purnota’s work since many years because my son was diagnosed with cancer five years ago, and later my mother too became a victim of the disease. A family is emotionally devastated when somebody from that family is diagnosed with cancer,” said Emraan.</p>
      <p>“My son Ayaan’s remission phase – during which cancer might make a comeback – was a tough phase for us as we parents go through a lot of fear psychosis. The whole process is psychologically disturbing. While researching about the disease, I got to know that nutrition plays an important role in the treatment as the body needs a strong immune system while going through the treatment. Even after the medical treatment, we have to focus on follow-up care, which involves proper nutrition and the well-being of a person, which has been the focal point of the Cuddle foundation.”</p>
