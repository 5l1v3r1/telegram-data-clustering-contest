      <h1>Ireland fans must wait almost a month for confirmation of Bratislava play-off</h1>
      <h2>FAI sources now say that it is more likely that the game will go ahead in Bratislava on March 26</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:32:42+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Ireland are expected to face Slovakia in Bratislava in their Euro 2020 play-off semi-final - but supporters must wait until December 20th for final confirmation.</p>
      <p>Although Ireland faced Slovakia in Zilina a decade ago, and all their home games in this qualification campaign took place in Trnava, FAI sources now say that it is more likely that the game will go ahead in the capital, Bratislava, on March 26.</p>
      <p>FAI officials met with their Slovakian counterparts in Nyon at lunchtime to discuss the venue and ticket allocation for visiting fans.</p>
      <p>“Slovakia have intimated the game will take place in Bratislava but they have some final checks to make on the ground there before they can confirm it as the venue," said a FAI spokesperson.</p>
      <p>“We have also opened talks with them on the allocation of tickets and will update our fans as soon as we can. </p>
      <p>"We are guaranteed five percent of the tickets but we are negotiating for more.</p>
      <p>“Tickets will be allocated to supporters based on away attendance records from the last two campaigns. </p>
      <p>"We will announce the application process as soon as we know our allocation.”</p>

      <p>FAI top brass will make it a priority to get hold of more tickets as there will be a big demand from travelling supporters.</p>
      <p>Following today's UEFA draw in Nyon, if they beat Slovakia then Mick McCarthy's side will be away from home in the play-off final against Northern Ireland or Bosnia-Herzegovina on March 31 - just five days later.</p>
      <p>“The only game that matters to us now is Slovakia,” said McCarthy after attending the draw.</p>
      <p>“If we win the first game against Slovakia then I will fancy our chances anywhere else. </p>
      <p>"We will have our analysis done on all three teams but our focus is on Slovakia first and getting ready for them in the New Year.</p>
      <p>“We know what we have to do, we have to go there and win the game. Home advantage is just that but if we play as well as we did against Denmark then I will settle for that. </p>
      <p>"We set the bar high on Monday night and that is the standard we will have to play at to win two games".</p>
