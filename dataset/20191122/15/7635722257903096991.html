        <b>The charity Women's Aid says almost nine in 10 women - 87% - are killed by a man known to them.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It has launched its Femicide Watch 2019 report, revealing that women in Ireland are more likely to be killed in their own homes and at the hands of a man they know.</p>
      <p>Five women have died violently so far this year - four of whom were killed in their own home.</p>
      <p>While 230 women have been killed, and 16 children have died alongside their mothers, since Women's Aid records began in 1996.</p>
      <p>More than half of these women were killed by a current or former boyfriend, husband or partner.</p>
      <p>Strangers make up just 13% of perpetrators of female homicide in Ireland.</p>
      <p>Women's Aid CEO is Sarah Benson: "These figures should shame Irish society. The legacy of loss is incalculable.</p>
      <p>"The lives of the women and children named in our report were so valuable, so full of potential which is now unrealised.</p>
      <p>"We want each of them to be remembered for their achievements, their qualities, their hopes and dreams.</p>
      <p>"We want to make visible, not only these needless deaths, but also the lives of these women and children, who mattered so much to so many."</p>
      <blockquote>"When women call Women's Aid and tell us that they are afraid for their lives, we believe them.</blockquote>
      <p>"We know just how dangerous domestic abuse can be. Femicide by an intimate partner must not be accepted as a fact of life in our society.</p>
      <p>"Women should be safe in their homes and in their relationships. And we must recognise the strong connection between the killing of women and domestic abuse."</p>
      <p>The charity is calling on the Government to introduce, properly resource and legislate for formal Domestic Homicide Reviews (DHRs) - and increase supports for families bereaved due to domestic homicide.</p>
      <p>It says until reviews happen, Ireland is failing to put in place the best strategies for high risk victims of domestic violence - leaving them vulnerable to escalating abuse and, in extreme cases, homicide.</p>

      <p>Ms Benson says: "Risk assessment and risk management strategies can be developed and employed by agencies tasked to protect women and children, such as An Garda Síochána, social workers, HSE and other authorities and specialist domestic violence services.</p>
      <p>"Many already have engaged in adopting such tools, which is extremely welcome."</p>
      <p>"We believe that media reporting on intimate partner femicide and domestic violence can improve and that positive and responsible reporting can add to the public's understanding and support those affected as they seek support and justice.</p>
      <p>"It can also safeguard the privacy and dignity of the victim, their families and their communities."</p>
