      <p>Long Island architecture studio Kevin O'Sullivan + Associates has created a <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/new-york-houses/">house</a> in <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/Amagansett/">Amagansett</a>, New York with wood prevalent inside and out to highlight the vernacular architecture in the region.</p>

      <p>Called Amagansett Beach 3, the family home comprises two gabled wings that are linked by a lower portion whose roofline nestles into their sides.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.kosullivan.com/">Kevin O'Sullivan + Associates</a> (KOS+A) clad the entire property in Alaskan Yellow cedar shingles because the material is prevalent to the <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/long-island/">Long Island</a> beach town.</p>

      <p>"The house was designed for a young New York City-based creative family who originally grew up in the Hamptons and South Africa," the studio told Dezeen.</p>
      <p>"They wanted something that fit with the vernacular style of the area with a warm and modern interior."</p>

      <p>Amagansett Beach 3 also features a combination of woods inside, as well as cream and grey tones to make a uniform palette.</p>
      <p>Wood is used on the floor, accent walls, built-in closets and bathroom vanities, and ranges from bleached walnut to live-sawn white oak.</p>

      <p>On the ground floor in the main living area, which is in the middle of the home, is an open-plan kitchen, dining room and lounge with ceiling beams sourced from a local barn.</p>
      <p>A row of glass doors opens to a patio, where there are lounge chairs and an outdoor swimming pool.</p>

      <p>KOS+A designed several custom pieces for the home, including oak kitchen cabinets and pantry storage, a stone dog bath in the mudroom nearby, and a cream sofa in the living room covered in Kravet fabric.</p>
      <p>The kitchen island, which is topped with white marble, was custom-made by the studio. It also created the millwork closets in the foyer made from white oak that has been bleached, fumed and whitewashed.</p>

      <p>Lights designed by US studio <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/apparatus/">Apparatus</a> are found throughout the home, while black pendants by <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/allied-maker/">Allied Maker</a> hang over the kitchen island.

      <p>The heart of the home is flanked by several rooms on either wing.</p>
      <p>An office and a television room with an L-shaped sofa are on one side, and on the other are a mudroom, foyer, laundry room, pantry and guest bedroom.</p>

      <p>Upstairs are a second home office and four bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, located within either wing of the house. One of them is a kid's bedroom with a circle window overlooking the great room below.</p>
      <p>The master bedroom has accesses to a rooftop deck overlooking the pool and backyard.</p>
