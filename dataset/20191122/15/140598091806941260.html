      <h3>What is it?</h3>
      <p>League leaders Liverpool travel to Selhurst Park to take on Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp's men sit atop the table with an eight-point lead over second-placed Leicester City and a nine-point lead over fellow title favourites Manchester City.</p>
      <p>A victory over Palace would heap even more pressure on City, who play later the same day - against Chelsea.</p>
      <h3>When is it?</h3>
      <p>Saturday, November 23.</p>
      <h3>What time is kick-off?</h3>
      <p>3pm GMT.</p>
      <h3>What TV channel is it on?</h3>
      <p>Because this game is a 3pm kick-off it won't be shown live in the UK. However, you can still follow all the action with us - courtesy of our live blog - if you bookmark this page.</p>
      <h3>What are the current standings?</h3>
      <h3>What is the team news?</h3>
      <h4>Crystal Palace</h4>
      <p>TBC</p>
      <h4>Liverpool</h4>
      <p>Influential centre-back Virgil Van Dijk is available for the trip to Selhurst Park after missing Holland's Euro 2020 qualifier against Estonia for personal reasons but doubts still persist of Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson.</p>
      <p>Both are struggling with ankle injuries - Salah since sustaining the problem against Leicester in October - and Klopp will have to make a late decision on the pair.</p>
      <h3>What are they saying?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says Joe Gomez is "better than good" after his altercation with Raheem Sterling earlier this month:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"He is good, better than good. The people involved were fine pretty quick. Things like this happen in football. Absolutely nothing to say about it. "The FA dealt with it how they saw right and I cannot judge that as I was not aware of the circumstances."</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>Klopp insists this season was never designated as the one in which they would end their long wait to win the championship and that title talk is for everyone else:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"We don't think about the title race. The biggest challenge for us is constantly facing questions about it. "After that it is completely normal season. We never made it the season where we have to (win the league). "We play as good as we can, try to get as many points as we can and the challenges are the 26 games we have to play - and the next one is Crystal Palace. "These challenges are big enough so we don't need any others and we don't think about anything else."</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson is expecting Liverpool to be at full strength, despite injury concerns over Andrew Robertson and Mo Salah</b>
        <b>:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"We are counting on them playing so until such time when I pick up the team sheet and they are not playing, then I'll think about it, but I think both will be fit to play. "I am presuming we will face what Jurgen Klopp has seen as his strongest team in recent weeks because I believe he has enough respect for us and what we are capable of doing not to make unnecessary changes if it is not forced upon him through injury."</blockquote>
      <h3>What are the odds?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Crystal Palace 6/1</li>
        <li>Draw - 7/2</li>
        <li>Liverpool - 4/9</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What's our prediction?</h3>
      <p>Crystal Palace are on a run of four league games without a win, losing three of them, while Liverpool are yet to taste defeat this season in the Premier League. The Reds will slip up at some point, but it seems unlikely to be here.<br/><b>Predicted score:</b> Crystal Palace 0 Liverpool 3.</p>
