      <h1>Man Utd squad vs Sheff Utd as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer faces central midfield crisis</h1>
      <h2>Manchester United are short of senior options in central midfield for the trip to Bramall Lane where Chris Wilder's Blades lie in wait</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:33:58+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:33</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ole-gunnar-solskjaer">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> is lacking options in the centre of midfield for Sunday's meeting with Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer confirmed on Friday that the Red Devils are keeping tabs on a number of midfield targets ahead of the January transfer window, amid continued injury issues ahead of the trip to Bramall Lane.</p>
      <p>Paul Pogba remains absent due to injury and is currently undergoing rehab in Miami.</p>
      <p>The World Cup winner could be missing until the new year, and has been joined on the sidelines by Scott McTominay, who has his own ankle issue.</p>
      <p>â€œScotty hurt his ankle and will be out for a couple of weeks," stated Solskjaer, for whom Nemanja Matic is available - but has only just returned from a month on the sidelines.</p>

      <p>That leaves Fred and Andres Pereira as the likely starting pair in midfield this weekend, with youngster Joe Garner likely to be on the bench.</p>
      <p>Luke Shaw and Axel Tuanzebe are available but lacking match fitness, while club captain Ashley Young is available after suspension.</p>
      <p>Whether he returns to the starting lineup at the expense of youngster Brandon Williams is another matter however.</p>
      <p>Eric Bailly, Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Diogo Dalot are stepping up their rehabilitation from injury, but all will miss out.</p>
      <p>Sheffield United will be without Dean Henderson for the encounter, with the on-loan stopper unable to play against his parent club.</p>
      <p>Skipper John Egan is also a doubt, after clashing heads with Andreas Cornelius during the Republic of Ireland's 1-1 draw with Denmark on Monday</p>
      <h3>Manchester United squad</h3>
      <p><b>Goalkeepers:</b> David de Gea, Lee Grant, Sergio Romero</p>
      <p><b>Defenders:</b> Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Ashley Young, Phil Jones, Victor Lindelof, Axel Tuanzebe, Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, Brandon Williams</p>
      <p><b>Midfielders:</b> Fred, James Garner, Juan Mata, Nemanja Matic, Andreas Pereira, Jesse Lingard, Tahith Chong</p>
      <p><b>Forwards:</b> Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood</p>
