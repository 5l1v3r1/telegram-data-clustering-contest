      <p>The police on Friday arraigned Olasina, 31, in Ile-Ife Magistrates’ Court in Osun State for allegedly beating up two Federal Road Safety Corps officers.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor, Insp. Sunday Osanyintuyi told the court that the defendant committed the offence on November 22, around 8.00 a.m. at the roundabout area of Ajebamidele,  Ile-Ife, Osun State.</p>
      <p>Osanyintuyi averred that the defendant conspired with two others now at large to commit the alleged felony.</p>
      <p>He said the defendant had unlawfully attacked and publicly assaulted Taiwo and Bello while they were performing their lawful duties.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor alleged that the defendant beat up the officers with cable wire and in the process inflicted injuries on their body.</p>
      <p>He also explained that the defendant maliciously tore the officers’ uniforms.</p>
      <p>Osanyintuyi, therefore, said that the offences contravened sections 356(3), 451 and 516 (1) of the Criminal Code, 2002.</p>
      <p><i>News Agency</i> <i>of Nigeria</i> reports that the defendant denied the allegations and went ahead to plead not guilty to the charge.</p>
      <p>Mr Ben Adirieje, the defence counsel, thereby applied for the bail of the defendant in the most liberal terms.</p>
      <p>Adirieje said his client was prepared to stand justice by attending court sessions until the matter was dispensed in one or another.</p>
      <p>The Magistrate, Mrs Bose Idowu granted Adirieje’s prayer by admitting the defendant to bail in the sum N100, 000 with two sureties in like sum.</p>
      <p>Idowu further ordered that the sureties must swear to an affidavit of means, provide three recent passport photographs each as well reside within the court’s jurisdiction before the bail could be perfected.</p>
      <p>She thereafter adjourned the case until December 6 for mention.</p>
