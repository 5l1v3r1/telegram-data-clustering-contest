      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:07:52+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:07</time> by <a rel="author">Nicholas Keyden, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/nicholas-keyden/</a></address>
      <p>A thug who left his girlfriend <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/justice">scarred for life</a> after smashing a glass bottle over her head following a row after a family <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> dinner is behind bars.</p>
      <p>Gordon Campbell, 51, had been at his father's house celebrating Christmas Day with his partner Tracey Welsh along with other relatives.</p>
      <p>They had downed drinks and enjoyed the festivities but when they returned to Campbell's flat violence erupted after they began 'bickering' on the way home.</p>
      <p>While her back was turned he smashed her head with a glass bottle from behind and then struck her again leaving her bleeding profusely.</p>
      <p>Miss Welsh, 45, fled the flat in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride</a> , Lanarkshire, fearing for her life and began desperately trying to wake up neighbours in the early hours of Boxing Day last year.</p>
      <p>She was taken to hospital and treated for her injuries and police were called.</p>
      <p>A trial heard one neighbour thought there had been a murder because of the amount of blood in the close of the flats.</p>
      <p>Campbell, of East Kilbride, denied all wrongdoing and went on trial at Hamilton Sheriff Court.</p>
      <p>He told the trial that he had been 'asleep' and that Miss Welsh, who he had been in a relationship with for four years, had drunkenly fallen and injured herself.</p>
      <p>But a jury took less than an hour to find him guilty of assaulting her by majority and he was remanded in custody by Sheriff Daniel Kelly QC.</p>
      <p>Depute fiscal Jennifer McLaren had urged jurors to convict Campbell, who has previous convictions for domestic abuse, of the brutal unprovoked assault in December last year.</p>
      <p>She said: "You will remember the words of Tracey Welsh: 'I thought he was going to come out and finish whatever he had started'.</p>
      <p>"These words after he had smashed a glass bottle into her head, first when her back was turned and then again when she was facing him.</p>
      <p>"There are certain things in society that we refuse to tolerate and domestic abuse is one of those things.</p>
      <p>"In years gone by there was an attitude that what goes on behind closed doors should stay there but society and the criminal justice system has moved on since.</p>
      <p>"Offending is not less serious because it happens behind closed doors but made more serious by it happening behind closed doors with victims unwilling to tell what happened.</p>
      <p>"Miss Welsh told you what happened to her, she told the police and then she came to court and told you.</p>
      <p>"During this attack, Mr Campbell was keen to keep this behind closed doors but what she told you was the truth and you should have no doubt about that.</p>
      <p>"If she had tripped and fallen then why would she phone the police and why would she wake the entire close up if this assault had not taken place?</p>
      <p>"You should have absolutely no reasonable doubt about Mr Campbell's guilt."</p>
      <p>Stephen McQuillan, defending, said his client should be cleared due to lack of evidence against him.</p>
      <p>He added: "Her evidence should leave you with a reasonable doubt.</p>
      <p>"He does not know what happened to her because he woke up and was looking for her, she was a missing person.</p>
      <p>"When he found her she accused him and he panicked and went away and that is his position.</p>
      <p>"She says she was hit by Mr Campbell and he says he did not, that is what this case comes down to and I say the Crown case does not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty of anything."</p>
      <p>Sheriff Kelly told Campbell: "I'm sure you're under no illusions that it is a serious charge that you face for a serious assault on Miss Welsh.</p>
      <p>"It was not as if you were coming before the court without previous convictions and you have assaulted Miss Welsh and someone else in a domestic setting before."</p>
      <p>Campbell will be sentenced next month.</p>
