      <p>JS Global analyst Maaz Mulla said equities concluded the day on a positive note with the benchmark KSE-100 index gaining 2.2% (824 points) to close at 37,926.</p>
      <p>Value buying was witnessed with interest from institutions and individuals. Traded value stood at $52 million, up 0.3% and volume came in at 243 million shares, up 4.5%.</p>
