      <p>A social media user identified as @Shalomtheo on micro blogging platform, Twitter, recently shared a funny story about his experience with a lady he met through the platform.</p>
      <p>According to @Shalomtheo, after they got a little cordial online, he decided to try his luck and invite her to his apartment for the weekend.</p>
      <p>Although doubtful that the lady would agree, she surprised him by accepting his invite to visit.</p>
      <p><i>"I didnâ€™t really expect her to agree so it was a pleasant surprise. I finished work early that day and went home to cook, clean and prepare for my August visitor. She said she would be coming in the evening. I was prepared by 3pm sef. Early bird. Early worm. Early knacks,"</i> @Shalomtheo tweeted.</p>

      <p>Narrating further, the young disclosed that after getting intimate with the lady, he was already getting bored of her presence by the next day, even though she was a nice person.</p>
      <p>He, however, took solace in the fact that the weekend was almost over and she would be on her way back home.</p>
