      <p><b>Updated November 22, 2019:</b> Microsoft confirmed to us that State of Decay 2 is coming to Steam in early 2020 and will support cross-play with Xbox One and Windows 10.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/state-decay-2-gets-long-awaited-character-customization-october">State of Decay 2</a> is a third-person survival game that focuses on scavenging and building bases. It launched on Xbox One and Windows 10 many months ago, and has since received a lot of updates to make it even better. While many PC gamers use the Microsoft Store, many still prefer Steam.</p>
      <p>Today, a listing for State of Decay 2 appeared on Steam which suggests that the title could be hitting the platform soon. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/495420/State_Of_Decay_2/">listing</a> says that it's going to launch on Apr 1, 2022, but that's definitely a placeholder. Hopefully, Microsoft or Undead Labs will make an official announcement soon.</p>
      <p>State of Decay 2 is part of <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> so you don't need to buy it on Steam to play it. Just subscribe to the service and you'll immediately gain access to over 200 games. If you get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, you'll gain access to even more on PC.</p>
