      <h3>The countdown to December 12 and the UK election – polls may be tricky</h3>

      <p><b>In 2017 Theresa May called an early election</b> in order to capitalize on the Tory Party being ahead in the plots and secure a larger majority in Parliament. The plan failed miserably and Theresa May could only control a majority after striking a £1bln deal with Northern Ireland's DUP.</p>
      <p>So, this takes us to the third roll of the dice with Boris Johnson. An early election is called for December 12 in which is the first December election in nearly a century. <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/the-countdown-to-december-12-and-the-uk-election-201911220918">Read more...</a></p>

      <h4>GBP/USD Forecast: Going nowhere in a hurry</h4>
      <p>The GBP/USD pair on Thursday initially edged higher and moved back closer to weekly tops, <b>albeit failed to capitalize on the momentum</b>. In a series of UK election polls, the latest Ipsos MORI's poll showed that the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party has gained three points to take its lead to 44% and turned out to be one of the key factors that provided a minor boost to the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd">British pound</a>. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the support for the <b>Labour Party also rose four points to 28%</b>, while support for the Liberal Democrats and Nigel Farage's Brexit Party dropped four points each to 16% and 3% respectively. <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/gbp-usd-forecast-going-nowhere-in-a-hurry-uk-us-pmis-eyed-for-some-impetus-201911220634">Read more...</a></p>
