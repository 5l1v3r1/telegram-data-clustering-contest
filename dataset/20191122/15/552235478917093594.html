      <p>Police are appealing for witnesses after an 11-year-old girl was struck by a car in Kilwinning - during the town's Christmas lights switch on.</p>
      <p>The incident happened at a pedestrian crossing in Lauchlan Way at around 7pm on Thursday, November 21.</p>
      <p>Police say a silver Toyota car collided with the youngster, whose condition is now described as 'stable', and believe the area was busy with people at the time.</p>
      <p>Inspector Greg Dinnie of Ayrshire Road Policing, said: “The young girl involved in this collision sustained injuries that required urgent medical attention and she had to remain in hospital overnight.</p>
      <p>“It would have been a busy area at the time with a large number of people in the town centre for the Christmas lights switch on.</p>
      <p>“I would appeal for anyone who was in the area that may have seen this incident to get in contact with police.”</p>
      <p>Information can be provided to Police Scotland via 101, quoting incident 3223 of 21 November 2019, or reported anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
