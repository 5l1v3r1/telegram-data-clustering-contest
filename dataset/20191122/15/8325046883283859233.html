        <li>Doctor Mikhail (Mike) Varshavski is a board-certified primary care physician and popular YouTube influencer with 4 million subscribers.</li>
        <li>Varshavski’s Instagram page went viral in 2015 after he was featured in a Buzzfeed article, and then again in People magazine’s 2015 Sexiest Man Alive issue.</li>
        <li>Today, Varshavski told Business Insider that he mainly splits his time between filming videos for YouTube and working as a doctor.</li>
        <li>He shared what an average filming day is like and took Business Insider inside his high-tech home studio.</li>

      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doctor-mike-on-youtube-instagram-influencer-business-interview-2019-11">Mike Varshavski</a> is a board-certified primary care physician who went viral in 2015 after he was featured in a <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kaelintully/i-love-dr-mike-almost-as-much-as-i-love-bobby-flay">BuzzFeed article about how attractive he was</a>, and then again in People magazine’s 2015 Sexiest Man Alive issue.</p>
      <p>Accepting his sudden fame, he launched a YouTube channel in 2017 while in his residency, and hired a videographer to film and edit the videos for him. He’s known as “Doctor Mike” online, and now has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0QHWhjbe5fGJEPz3sVb6nw/videos?view=0&amp;amp;sort=da&amp;amp;flow=grid">millions of YouTube subscribers</a> with videos that often appear on the trending page of YouTube.</p>
      <p>Yet his YouTube channel was not an immediate success.</p>
      <p>“I launched the channel and it picked up like 15,000 subscribers,” he told Business Insider. “It didn’t go anywhere, even though I told 2 million people on Instagram to come watch it.”</p>
      <p>Varshavski said he realized the key to growing an audience was consistency (he’s never missed a single posting day) and figuring out what content would appeal to a wider audience.</p>
      <h3>From hospital to filming studio, how Varshavski does it</h3>
      <p>In his second year of YouTube, while keeping up with his career as a doctor, Varshavski started posting videos twice a week instead of once.</p>
      <p>“The first half of the week I am making YouTube videos,” he said. “The second half of the week I’m in the hospital actually doing the things I’m talking about.”</p>
      <p>His videos gain an average 500,000 views to around 4 million views, depending on if a video is picked up by YouTube’s algorithm and recommended to viewers.</p>
      <p>He puts his own spin on concepts like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/pewdiepie-youtube-felix-kjellberg-life-career-controvery-2019-9">PewDiePie</a>‘s popular “Meme Review,” where Varshavski <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Xj6SNIY94">reacts to medical memes</a>, or shows like “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvu5zUbkNww">Grey’s Anatomy</a>.”</p>
      <p>To keep track of his growing online business, Varshavski signed with the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/top-talent-agents-of-youtube-creators-influencers-uta-wme-caa-2019-11#abrams-artists-agency-maxwell-mitcheson-amanda-marzolf-jade-sherman-melissa-demarco-keith-bielory-and-marienor-madrilejo-1">digital talent agency, Abrams Artists Agency</a> three years ago. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/top-talent-agents-of-youtube-creators-influencers-uta-wme-caa-2019-11#abrams-artists-agency-maxwell-mitcheson-amanda-marzolf-jade-sherman-melissa-demarco-keith-bielory-and-marienor-madrilejo-1">His agent</a> works to build up the business aspects of his social media, like landing public speaking appearances and producing a line of products (that will be coming out soon, Varshavski said).</p>
      <p>With the help of his videographer, Dan, Varshavski films a batch of videos during filming days, which Dan will later edit throughout the week.</p>
      <p>Most people think Varshavski has a large team helping him out, he said. But he really only has Dan and his agent.</p>
