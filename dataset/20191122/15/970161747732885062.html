      <p>Towie’s Lewis Bloor has been pictured snorting a suspicious white powder during a night out in London.</p>
      <p>The Celebrity Big Brother star was enjoying an evening out with pals in Soho when he was spotted joining two men in a car.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old reportedly spent one minute in the back seat, before collecting something from the men in question and returning to his friends.</p>
      <p>He was then seen holding a bag containing suspicious white powder and snorting something on the street while a pal looked on.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10391611/towie-cbb-lewis-bloor-snorts-white-powder/">The Sun states</a> the reality star turned DJ reportedly coated his finger in the substance before rubbing it into his gums.</p>

      <p>During his time on the series – where he came 10th – he sparked a romance with Marnie Simpson, but it wasn’t to last and they split soon after, when he admitted to cheating on her.</p>
      <p>Lewis recently made headlines after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/19/towie-star-lewis-bloor-denies-conspiracy-defraud-3-million-diamond-scam-10771501/">appearing in court on charges of conspiracy to defraud</a> in an alleged £3 million diamond scam.</p>
      <p>He has been accused of duping 50 victims with coloured diamonds along with five other men, something he has fiercely denied.</p>
