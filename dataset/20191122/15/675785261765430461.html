      <h1>Terminator: Resistance review: Make your own fate in this average action game</h1>
      <h2>First person shooter Terminator: Resistance sees you take on Skynet in an experience that will mostly appeal to hardcore Terminator fans</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:15:51+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author">charlene bougourd</a></address>
      <p>From developer Teyon, Terminator: Resistance is a sci-fi first person shooter set in the Terminator universe that puts you in the shoes of resistance soldier Jacob Rivers.</p>
      <p>As the sole survivor of your team, you must seek out fellow resistance fighters and civilians in order to continue the fight against rogue AI Skynet and its army of robotic killing machines.</p>
      <p>Along the way you’ll meet a stereotypical mixed bag of survivors, from the happy helpful one, the standoffish cynic, someone with medical training and an innocent child caught up in the brutality of conflict. You end up joining them and looking for a safe place to stay while the bus they have is fixed, and eventually make contact with a resistance commander who recruits you to her unit and go off on missions to get rid of Skynet for good.</p>

      <p>In the style of Telltale Games’ The Walking Dead titles, there are branching conversations and story moments. Each decision you make determines how the game goes and how people will respond to you. The more you talk to them, the more they appreciate it and it shows up on the left-hand side. If you make a choice they don’t like, they will react accordingly to it and let you know about it. These moments demand that you pay attention as they influence which of the game’s multiple endings you’ll get.</p>
      <p>There’s a bit of everything here. The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/video-games">game</a> has quite a good storyline, side missions, and looting as well as some weapon customisation. You can also get awarded points to improve Jacob in areas like stealth, weapons, storage capacity etc.</p>

      <p>The weapon customisation is a good idea. You do this by using chips that Terminators have dropped once you kill them. Via a mini-game, You have to match them to form a circuit loop or you will have to try again.</p>
      <p>There’s also some hacking to do, letting you commandeer turrets to help you combat the machines as well as terminals to get in to gates. The hacking game is basically a version of Frogger with a Pong look to it. It’s a fairly simple process but I found myself having to restart it a good few times due to the high speed.</p>
      <p>Missions can be approached in a stealthy manner or with all guns blazing, with the option to either sneak through or blow something up. Searching around the environment while looting will often lead to these different paths presenting themselves.</p>

        <figcaption>Everything looks appropriately grey for the most part</figcaption>

      <p>The simple, retro-style interface and the music fit in with the original Terminator film, making the experience feel authentic. There’s also a very Fallout feel given the post apocalyptic wasteland setting with its broken down shops and crumbling buildings. The whole thing is very grey looking,which isn’t particularly vibrant to look at but it is certainly believable.</p>
      <p>Despite using the Unreal 4 engine, the graphics are a bit lacking. Although it doesn’t look terrible and the Terminators T-800s look really good, some of the character’s faces are of poor quality. This is accompanied with some underwhelming voice acting.</p>

      <p>At the start of the game, the Terminators are fairly scary thanks to the paltry arsenal you have, but once you have a better weapon it makes it a lot easier to defeat them. This isn’t helped by having the patrolling androids having a set footpath, meaning you can easily get the jump on them. This leaves very little surprise for the player.</p>
      <p>While you can freely roam around the maps, each level is separate and only accessed via the story. It’s a functional set-up, but would be better if it was a fully open world.</p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>If you’re a fan of the Terminator movies, there is some appeal here, even if only a little. There are even a few nods to moments from the films - like the lorry from the chase in Terminator 2 - and the mid 80s / early 90s version of future tech that appears adds to the nostalgia boost. Despite the different endings you can unlock, it’s unlikely that you’ll go back and replay it unless you really loved the experience.</p>
