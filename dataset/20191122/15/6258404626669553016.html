      <p>Nearly two years ago, OnePlus announced that it had experienced a security breach that resulted in the <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/oneplus-says-40000-customers-exposed-to-credit-card-security-breach">credit card details of roughly 40,000 customers</a> being stolen. "We are also working with our current payment providers to implement a more secure credit card payment method, as well as conducting an in-depth security audit," wrote the company at the time. "All these measures will help us prevent such incidents from happening in the future."</p>
      <p>Now, <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/oneplus">OnePlus</a> is reporting that it has experienced yet another security incident, and this time the company says that personal information from some of its users was accessed by an "unauthorized party". OnePlus is not naming this third-party company/vendor, but it says that the following information was accessible:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Contact number</li>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>Shipping address</li>
        <li>Certain order details</li>
      </ul>
      <p>OnePlus says that it has already reached out to its customers that have been affected by this security incident, but it isn't disclosing the total number involved. The company writes:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>We understand that personal information is very important to our users, and all impacted users were notified via email. If you don’t get an email from us today, rest assured that your order information is safe. However, if you have further concerns, please contact us at oneplus.com/support for assistance.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>OnePlus is also warning affected users to be more vigilant in the coming days and weeks if their personal data was indeed compromised. According to OnePlus Security Team member Ziv, "Impacted users may receive spam and phishing emails as a result of this incident."</p>
      <p>In a repeat from last year's mishap, Ziv continued, adding, "We are deeply sorry about this, and are committed to doing everything in our power to prevent further such incidents."</p>

      <p>Not surprisingly, OnePlus users weren't too forgiving in the <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/security-notification.1144088/">accompanying forum thread</a> announcing the discovery, with Ch4rlux writing, "Seems you didn't get the lesson from last time." Ariblaze added, "The sad part is this is not the first time that this is happening," while knollorulez chimed in, defiantly writing, "You've messed it up. Again. Why don't you just sell my data? FU one plus."</p>
      <p>Needless to say, OnePlus has a lot of work cut out for it when it comes to locking down its customer data. Sound off in the comments for your thoughts on the topic. Did any of you receive an email from OnePlus?</p>
