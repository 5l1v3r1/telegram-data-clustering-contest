        <b>During the Correctional Senior Women Conference at Prisons Staff Training College in Ruiru on Thursday, November 21, Emily Amakobe was definitely in the list of spectacular performers who were not to be left out in the awards, after a brave act of making an arrest to an escaped convict she met coincidentally.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Through a Twitter post, Kenya Prisons Service confirmed that the incident happened along Lang’ata Road where Amakobe risked her life to ensure the prison escapee was recaptured.</p>
      <p>“Among those honoured in this photo with 5 Cabinet secretaries during the Correctional Senior Women Conference at Prisons Staff Training College Ruiru is Emilly Amakobe who while in a Matatu on Lang'ata Road, alighted to arrest a male Prisoner whom she had known to have escaped from Langata Prison,” read the tweet.</p>

      <p>“Emily observed the convict from far and identified him. She immediately alighted and went farther to face him head-on. Her bravery helped bring back the convict who had no escape,” the source familiar with the incident who sought anonymity narrated to this writer. </p>
      <p>Emily was awarded in an event that was had high-level government representation including Cabinet secretaries Fred Matiang'i, Margaret Kobia, Monicah Juma, Faridah Karoney and Raychelle Omamo.</p>

I also extended an opportunity for one officer from the [service] to be incorporated into the gender sector working group which addresses Gender Equality and Empowerment issues including GBV,” read a post on CS Kobia’s Twitter page.</p>
