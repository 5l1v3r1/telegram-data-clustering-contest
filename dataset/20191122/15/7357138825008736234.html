      <h1>L’Oréal’s Integration With Salesforce Brings eCommerce Boost</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:30:51+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2019/loreal-q4-earnings-revenue-beauty-sales/">L’Oréal</a> has been using various cloud-based enterprise and customer relationship management (CRM) solutions from Salesforce to sell its products online, resulting in a 48.5 percent boost in eCommerce sales in the first half of 2019.</p>
      <p>L’Oréal, which boasts brands including Kiehl’s, Lancôme and Yves Saint Laurent Beauté, has been utilizing Salesforce modules including Commerce Cloud, Community Cloud, Einstein Analytics, Marketing Cloud, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud and Success Cloud.</p>
      <p>“L’Oréal has been focused on digital transformation for the better part of a decade, and our effort is entirely focused on creating added value for our consumers,” <a href="https://chainstoreage.com/loreal-creates-foundation-unified-digital-engagement">said</a> Michael Kingston, CIO, L’Oréal Americas. “Year after year, we have continued to grow our partnership with Salesforce because the platform allows us to move fast, innovate constantly and reach consumers across different points of engagement. Whether it’s in-store or online, it’s all about using technology to create a consistent shopping journey and deliver personalized <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2019/health-beauty-merchant-innovation-loyalty-competition/">beauty</a> experiences at scale.”</p>
      <p>The beauty retailer has launched Salesforce technology in more than 150 eCommerce sites in 63 global markets, as well as customer service centers in more than 10 countries.</p>
      <p>Salesforce <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2019/salesforce-taps-amazon-for-call-center-ai/">announced</a> last week that it was expanding its partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to offer customer service technology powered by artificial intelligence (AI), launching Service Cloud Voice to provide customer service tools to agents at contact centers. Integrating with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/connect/">Amazon Connect</a>, which is part of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>, Service Cloud Voice brings phone, digital channels and CRM data into one unified console.</p>
      <p>And last month, Salesforce <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/salesforce-order-management-integration-commerce/">launched</a> Lightning Order Management, a new order management function targeting integration of the ordering process, including fulfillment and customer service. The tool fits within the existing Salesforce Commerce Cloud suite of services and includes order lifecycle management, allowing online sellers to manage orders all the way to shipping and delivery. The tool offers order processing and fulfillment tools that can be customized based on product type, fulfillment location and shipping carrier.</p>
