      <h1>'You can do' - John McGinn's brilliant 10-word vow to Aston Villa boss Dean Smith</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa v Newcastle United | The Scottish midfielder has now scored 10 goals from his last 20 games for club and country, meaning he's in the goal-scoring form of his career</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:53:04+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:53</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Preece, https://www.facebook.com/PreeceBirminghamLive/</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa head coach Dean Smith could have his goal-scoring prayers answered - by super John McGinn.</p>
      <p>The Scot notched three in games against Cyprus and Kazakhstan during the international week, taking his goals tally to 10 from 20 matches for club and country.</p>
      <p>The all-action midfielder is in a red-hot streak in front of goal and "bounced into Bodymoor Heath" after being in fine form away with Scotland.</p>

      <p>McGinn, 25, has three Premier League strikers from Villa's 12 games and pulled Smith aside during training this week.</p>
      <p>"All the internationals have come back in a buoyant mood," the Villa boss explained. "We've got John McGinn who's been to Scotland and scored, what is it? Six goals his last three games for Scotland. He's bounced into the camp!</p>
      <p>"We're hoping (he continues scoring), yeah. Hopefully he'll get a few now, he's hit the goal trail. He said to me if you need to throw me upfront, you can do!"</p>
      <h3>Aston Villa - End of Decade</h3>
      <p>Welcome to our Aston Villa 'End of Decade' series.</p>
      <p>We're looking back on the 'Teenies' - the last 10 years at AVFC.</p>
      <p>It's hardly been a vintage time for Villa, but at least it is ending with plenty of hope and optimism with the Lions finally back in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>There's been some lowlights, and a smattering of highlights from January 2010 to now - and we'll bring you a host of them here.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere, looking ahead to Monday night under the lights against Newcastle, Smith added: "The supporters have been integral to us being where we are in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>"We don't lose many games at Villa Park and it took until the 94 minute for Liverpool to win and a couple of mistakes in our first game against Bournemouth but with the supporters behind us that's what I expect more of."</p>
