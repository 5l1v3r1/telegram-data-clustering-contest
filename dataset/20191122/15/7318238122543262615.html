      <p>Demonstrators clashed violently with security force vehicles in Santiago on Thursday, November 21, as the demonstrations that shook Chile moved into their second month.</p>
      <p>Throwing stones and pointing lasers at vehicles, demonstrators found water cannons and tear gas from Chilean security forces on a street in the capital that looked like a battlefield.</p>
      <p>The protests that began during a walk at subway fares have sometimes been triggered by violent riots, looting and arson.</p>
      <p>The government of Chilean President Sebastián Piñera promised a series of reforms to quell the demands of protesters, from raising the minimum wage to completing pensions.</p>
