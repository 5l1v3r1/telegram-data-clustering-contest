      <p>Adelani Adepegba, Abuja<br/> <br/>The African Union has admonished Nigeria and other member states to fight insecurity and corruption along their international boundaries as part of effective border security management.</p>
      <p>The continental body also called on the states to share actionable intelligence with their neighbours to enhance security at the borders.</p>
      <p>These were the highlights of the planning workshop on the implementation of the African Union Border Programme in the West African region held in Abuja from November 19-21,2019.</p>
      <p>A communique issued at the end of the workshop on Friday asked AU member states to consider the integration of regional and sub-regional organizations that have a relationship with border management within their territories.</p>
      <p>It said, “Member states should design and develop a cross-border security plan along their common boundaries.</p>
      <p>”They should endeavour to collaborate with the media (radio stations, news agencies) along their border communities with a view to carrying out continuous sensitization of their border communities on the issues of promotion of free movement of persons, goods and services and fighting against harassment and bribery.”</p>
      <p>The AUBP also recommended that member states should fast-track the ratification of the Niamey Convention, adding that they should also involve the civil society, youth, and women in cross-border cooperation matters.</p>
