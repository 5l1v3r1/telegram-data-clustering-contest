      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/MKS.L">MKS.L</a>) has appointed the chief executive of rival Tesco’s (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/TSCO.L">TSCO.L</a>) F&amp;F Clothing division to be the boss of its struggling clothing and home business, it said on Friday.</p>

      <p>M&amp;S, one of the best known names in British retail, said Richard Price, 52, would re-join the group as managing director, clothing &amp; home next year.</p>
      <p>The appointment sent shares in M&amp;S up 2.7% by 1540 GMT, paring losses over the last year to 33%.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month M&amp;S reported a 17% drop in first-half profit, dragged down by falling clothing sales, but said it was confident it could fix its problems and return to growth.</p>
      <p>In July, M&amp;S’ CEO Steve Rowe sacked clothing division head Jill McDonald after publicly criticising poor availability, and assumed direct leadership of the business himself.</p>
      <p>Price started his career at Next (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/NXT.L">NXT.L</a>) before working for M&amp;S from 2005 to 2012. He was head of merchandise, before being promoted to menswear trading director in 2008.</p>
      <p>He left M&amp;S to become managing director of department store chain BHS and joined Tesco, Britain’s biggest retailer, in 2015, growing F&amp;F’s annual revenue to over 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion).</p>
      <p>“I left the business because I felt it was drifting in the wrong direction but now feel we have a real chance to make it special again,” said Price.</p>
      <p>“The new team has already started to improve product and value and I am looking forward to working with them.”</p>
      <p>The job is one of the biggest in British retail.</p>
      <p>In its 1990s heyday, M&amp;S was the go-to British high street destination for clothes, selling everything from party dresses to suits and underwear.</p>
      <p>In 1997, it became the first UK retailer to make an annual profit of 1 billion pounds. But while the 135-year-old group remains Britain’s largest clothing retailer in sales terms, it has been squeezed by the likes of Inditex’s Zara, H&amp;M, Primark (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/ABF.L">ABF.L</a>) and the supermarkets’ clothing businesses.</p>
      <p>M&amp;S said Price’s start date “will be confirmed in due course”.</p>
      <p>But it may have to wait if Tesco hold Price to the notice period on his contract and place him on “gardening leave”. Tesco declined to comment.</p>
      <p>In October last year, M&amp;S recruited George Wright from Tesco to be its new food commercial director but he did not start until April this year.</p>
      <p>McDonald departed M&amp;S after less than two years in the job. She was named as Costa Coffee’s (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/KO.N">KO.N</a>) new CEO on Wednesday.</p>
