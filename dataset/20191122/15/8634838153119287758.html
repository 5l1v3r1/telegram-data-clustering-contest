      <h1>Controversial "Mtumba" Bus Purchase in Bungoma</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/37426-mca-loses-job-over-special-relationship-governor">Bungoma MCAs</a> are seeking the removal of the county assembly service board over a purchase that was marred by corruption allegations.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The county legislators drawn from both the majority and minority camps on Friday, November 22, called for the immediate resignation of all top assembly officials over the ridiculous purchase of a bus they described as <i><a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/42692-ass-minister-whose-love-mitumba-clothes-was-unmatched">mtumba</a> </i>(second-hand).</p>
      <p>The embattled officials include majority leader Florence Fulano, minority leader Francis Chepmion, the clerk to the assembly and speaker Emmanuel Situma.</p>
      <p>The legislators had raised the issue during a Tuesday session and demanded answers over the matter. Kimaeti MCA, Eric Wapang'ana told journalists how they found out that the newly-purchased assembly bus was indeed not a new one.</p>
      <p>“This is a Lorry, not a bus. It was brought here after purchase but we are not satisfied with it.</p>
      <p>"When we inspected the bus we realised it was secondhand. It also seems the bus has previously been involved in an accident and then repaired and repainted for us to use,”  the legislator told <i>Citizen TV</i>.</p>

      <p>The<a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/45166-police-intercept-church-bus-transporting-bhang"> bus</a> bearing registration number 39CG 255A was allegedly bought from a broker associated with the assembly clerk at a cost of Ksh 4.5 million.</p>
      <p>This was a contraction to the budgetary allocation of Ksh6 million that was set aside for the purchase, according to the MCAs.</p>
      <p>They also alleged that the company from which the vehicle was purchased never featured anywhere during the tendering process.</p>
      <p>“According to the response by the county assembly service board, the bus specifications should have been a 33- seater. But the bus delivered is a 28-seater,” Mbakalo Ward MCA Bethuel Mwambu asserted.</p>
