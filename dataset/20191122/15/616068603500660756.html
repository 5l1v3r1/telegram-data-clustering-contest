      <p>“Dripping with the blood of six million Jews,” is how a member of Richmond’s Jewish community describes Nazi memorabilia up for auction on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The items should not be sold for profit, Michael Sachs, past-president of Bayit Synagogue in Richmond, says. Rather they belong in a museum or educational institute where they can be displayed with the right context.</p>
      <p>The “Firearms &amp; Militaria Auction” at Maynards in Richmond includes a large collection of guns and military paraphernalia from around the world.</p>
      <p>The online catalogue shows several items from Nazi Germany, including a German Luftwaffe officer’s dagger, a German fireman’s helmet, and swastika flag.</p>
      <p>Hugh Bulmer, vice-president with Maynards, says history can’t be swept under the rug and the stories around these items need to be kept alive.</p>
      <p>“It’s part of history,” he said.</p>
      <p>Richmond Mayor Malcolm Brodie called the auction “inappropriate," and Richmond-Queensborough MLA Jas Johal asked Maynards on Facebook to remove the Nazi material from the auction.</p>
