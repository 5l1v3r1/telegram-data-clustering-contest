      <h1>Young Sheldon’ Creator Chuck Lorre Posts Impeachment Message in Show’s Credits</h1>
      <h2>Left-wing TV producer Chuck Lorre used the credits of Thursday night’s edition of Young Sheldon and Mom to <a href="https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/culture/sadi-martin/2019/11/21/liberal-churck-lorre-calls-trump-unprincipled-despotic">share a quote</a> from Alexander Hamilton that he believes would have made him a supporter of impeaching President Donald Trump.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T15:42:10+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 15:42</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/benjkew/, Ben Kew</a></address>
      <p>At the end of Thursday’s night’s episodes, Lorre, who co-created the shows, posted one of his “Chuck Lorre Productions” vanity cards with a quote from the Founding Father that was recently used in a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/10/18/hamilton-pushed-impeachment-powers-trump-is-what-he-had-mind/?arc404=true"><i>Washington Post </i>op-ed</a> by Hamilton biography Ron Chernow, arguing Hamilton would have supported attempts by Democratic Party lawmakers to impeach Trump.</p>
      <p>The use of Hamilton’s quote was a suggestion that Trump may be deliberately seeking to inflict chaos on the country by repeatedly trying to embarrass the General Government while scoffing at the principles of liberty.</p>
      <p>The quote is as follows:</p>
      <blockquote>When a man unprincipled in private life, desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper . . . despotic in his ordinary demeanour — known to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty — when such a man is seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity — to join in the cry of danger to liberty — to take every opportunity of embarrassing the General Government &amp; bringing it under suspicion — to flatter and fall in with all the non sense of the zealots of the day — It may justly be suspected that his object is to throw things into confusion that he may ‘ride the storm and direct the whirlwind.’ Alexander Hamilton (Special thanks to Ron Chernow)</blockquote>
      <p>Of course this is not the first time that 67-year-old<i> </i>producer has used his vanity cards to attack Donald Trump. Last October, Lorre used the credits of <i>Big Bang Theory </i>to <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/10/29/big-bang-theory-airs-anti-trump-message-fascist-hate-filled-fear-mongering/">attack</a> Trump as “a fascist, hate-filled, fear-mongering, demagogic, truth-shattering, autocratic golf cheater,” while appealing to God to reduce Republican voter turnout. In January, Lorre used the credits of the same show to convey a similar message, <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/01/04/big-bang-theory-creator-chuck-lorre-attacks-trump/">describing</a> Trump as America’s “Gangster-in-Chief.”</p>
      <p>Lorre, who is also known for producing other hit TV shows such as <i>Two and a Half Men </i>and <i>Grace Under Fire, </i>has also previously <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/05/04/big-bang-theory-creator-chuck-lorre-claims-trump-has-brain-damage-untreated-syphilis/">suggested</a> that Trump suffers a mental condition caused by brain damage at birth and that he had contracted the sexually transmitted disease syphilis.</p>
