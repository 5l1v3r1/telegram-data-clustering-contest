      <p>Hazard joined Los Blancos from Chelsea for a reported fee of €100 million (R1.6 billion) in July, but the Belgium international could have played for Paris Saint-Germain were it not for his conscience.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old recently told<i> L'Equipe</i> that Ligue 1 giants PSG had frequently contacted him during his time with the Blues, and explained that his loyalty to former club Lille always forced him to say no to a possible move. </p>

      <p>"They (PSG) often tried to recruit me, but I didn't want to return to Ligue 1 unless it was to join Lille," Hazard said.</p>
      <p>"I always said no to them. It was clear in my mind that if I were to return to France, it would be with Lille."</p>
