      <p>Berlin Zoo has released intimate footage of its three-month-old panda cubs.</p>

      <p>The two cubs were born to mother Meng Meng and father Jiao Qing following a gestation period of 147 days, doubling Germanyâ€™s panda population in one fell swoop.</p>
      <p>The two cubs were born weighing just 186 and 136 grams, and are being raised by their mother.</p>
