      <h1>Review: Frozen II’s gorgeous animation can’t quite rise above “meh” soundtrack</h1>
      <h2>There's no musical equivalent of “Let It Go” here—a mercy to parents everywhere.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:04:48+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:04</time> by <a rel="author">Jennifer Ouellette</a></address>
      <p><i>Let it go, let it goooo</i>... Just when that tune was starting to fade from our collective brain, Elsa, Anna, and the gang are back with another mystical adventure in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_2"><i>Frozen II</i></a>, the sequel to Disney's blockbuster 2013 hit, <i>Frozen</i>. It's well-made, fun family fare with gorgeous visuals—we'd expect nothing less from the Mouse House—but somehow it never quite achieves the same emotional resonance of the original.</p>
      <p>
        <b>(Spoilers for original <i>Frozen</i> below; mild spoilers for <i>Frozen II</i>.)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_(2013_film)">first film</a> told the story of two princesses of Arendelle. The elder, Elsa (Idina Menzel), has the power to control and create ice and snow, but she struggles to control it. When she accidentally injures her young sister Anna (Kristen Bell), local trolls heal Anna but caution that Elsa must learn to control her magic. In response, their parents lock them both away. When Elsa turns 21, she's crowned queen, but a spat with Anna after the coronation reveals her magic. She's exiled from the kingdom, flees to the mountains, and builds a gorgeous castle of ice and snow in which to live out her days in isolation. But she doesn't realize Arendelle has also frozen over, endangering the people.</p>
      <p>Anna goes off in search of Elsa with the help of an ice harvester named Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his trusty reindeer Sven, as well as a snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad). Naturally it all works out in the end because this is a Disney fairytale. <i>Frozen</i> earned over $1.2 billion worldwide, making it the highest grossing animated film of all time. It won Oscars for Best Animated Film and Best Song—"Let It Go," the song Elsa sings as she's building her ice castle. It also spawned numerous spinoffs in multiple forms of media (including a Broadway musical), making it one of Disney's most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_(franchise)">profitable franchises</a>. So of course there was going to be a sequel.</p>
      <p><i>Frozen II</i> is set three years after the events of the original. Elsa has reigned over a time of peace and prosperity for Arendelle, the socially awkward Kristoff is trying to figure out how to propose to Anna, and Olaf the enchanted snowman is just being Olaf, spouting all the fascinating new trivia he's been learning as he ages (instead of melting away like all the other snowmen). But Elsa is restless, and when she starts hearing a mysterious voice singing out to her from the far north, she responds—accidentally awaking powerful elemental forces (earth, wind, fire, and water) in the process. The people of Arendelle are forced to evacuate and take refuge with the trolls while Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf set out for the enchanted forest to find the source of the mysterious singing.</p>

      <p>As always, the animation is stunning, particularly the sequence where Elsa is trying to cross the Dark Sea with her usual trick of turning the water into ice so she can walk across. But this time her ice bridge fails, and while thrashing about in the waves, she meets a Nokk (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_(water_spirit)#N%C3%A4ck,_N%C3%B8kk">shape-shifting water spirit</a>), ultimately taming the creature and riding it across the Dark Sea. Where the original film focused heavily on Anna's journey to find her sister, <i>Frozen II</i> is mostly about Elsa's quest to discover who (or what) is calling out to her and to learn more about the source of her power—and maybe even discover the truth about a dark moment in Arendelle's history.</p>
      <p>If you're getting a sense of déjà vu—well, the movie does follow the tried-and-true Disney formula. Kudos to screenwriter Jennifer Lee for weaving in more of the Scandinanvian folklore elements to bring something new to the table, centering the film on the fictional Northuldra people, based on the indigenous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1mi_people">Sami</a> population who live in the northern parts of Norway, Sweden, and Finland. (In fact, Disney <a href="https://www.themarysue.com/sami-frozen-ii/">worked closely</a> with several Sami parliaments to ensure a respectful portrayal of their culture.)</p>
      <p>The film's greatest flaw is its so-so soundtrack. The songs are mediocre and truly forgettable, despite having been written by the same duo, Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. There's no charming "So You Want to Build a Snowman" or soaring ballad on the scale of "Let It Go"—which will no doubt be welcome news to frazzled parents with <i>Frozen</i>-obsessed young children, forced to listen to that tune on a constant loop for the last six years. The notable exception is the folk tune briefly sung by the Northuldra people. But it's not part of the official soundtrack, so I doubt we'll be hearing it on a constant loop. [Update: The tune, "Iduna's Scarf," is available on the Deluxe soundtrack edition.]</p>
      <p>Confession: I was never among those who raved endlessly about the original <i>Frozen,</i> although I enjoyed it and especially appreciated how it reinterpreted Hans Christian Andersen's classic fairy tale <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snow_Queen"><i>The Snow Queen</i></a>. Yes, it's a good film, but I found <i>Frozen</i>'s blockbuster global success rather baffling. Likewise, I enjoyed <i>Frozen II,</i> but it didn't do much to change my perspective on the franchise. Still, it will no doubt delight hardcore fans, even if the sequel doesn't quite have the same magical shine as its predecessor.</p>
      <p><i>Frozen II</i> opens today in theaters.</p>
