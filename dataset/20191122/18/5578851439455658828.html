      <p>Ambassador Alice Wells, with the US State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, said in a discussion at the Wilson Center in Washington, DC on Thursday that “China has not been a real player in Afghanistan development” and “is not a provider of any significant grant assistance.” She said that neighbors Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have done much more to aid Afghanistan with “regional connectivity initiatives” such as cross-border railways, electricity lines and trade exchange.</p>
      <p>However, Wells acknowledged that China can play an important role in the peace process:</p>
      <p>“Right now I would say I see opportunities for the United States and China to be important partners in reinforcing the need for a negotiated political settlement, and you see Ambassador Khalilzad regularly consulting with his Chinese counterpart, among other regional actors.”</p>
      <p>Wells also spoke about the US relationship with Pakistan, saying as “Pakistan takes steps to move away and to restrict the ability of non-state terrorist proxies, the potential for our relationship to grow ever-deeper is there.”</p>
      <p>These comments come as China is scheduled to host a peace settlement meeting. The meeting was scheduled to take place last month but was delayed for some reason.</p>
      <p>The Afghan government says it has set up a delegation list to attend the meeting, but meeting time has not been announced.</p>
      <p>In related news, two US senators, Bob Menendez and Todd Young, have introduced a bill to mandate congressional oversight of the Afghan peace settlement.</p>
      <p>The legislation is intended to protect Afghan human rights, prevent the “chaos” of a quick troop withdrawal, and deny access to terrorists seeking a safe haven.</p>
