      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:45:02+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:45</time> by <a rel="author">Samuel Akumatey, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Ho, Nov. 22, GNA - More than 100 tents have been erected at the Ho Sports Stadium for the Fourth Volta Trade and Investment Fair opening on Friday, November 22.</p>
      <p>Mr Delali Ndo, a member of the Planning Committee, told the Ghana News Agency (GNA) that the Fair would exhibit the rich culture of the Volta Region and beyond, innovation from the youth in digitization, and improved packaging of local foods and drinks, as well as clothing.</p>
      <p>He said Toyota Ghana would be mounting a vehicle show in the Region for the first time and space had been allotted to the various municipal and district assemblies to showcase their investment potentials.</p>
      <p>Small holder women agro processors are also expected to mount stands with the reenactment of traditional practices and games, some of which are long forgotten.</p>
      <p>Provisions have also been made for governmental and non-governmental agencies, departments and agencies to display their goods, services and policies.</p>
      <p>Mr Seth Yao Asamoah, an event manager, said more than  200 exhibitors would occupy the stadium, whiles hundreds of petty traders and businesses would reap from the thousands of visitors who would be attracted to the week-long fair.</p>
      <p>He said each district assembly was expected to provide at least five Small to Medium Scale Enterprises to market the district’s investment potentials, adding that it would also help boost tourism.</p>
      <p>A stage for live musical shows is also being mounted by some local artistes to entertain the visitors.      </p>
      <p>Mr Asamoah said the Fair, last held in 2011, would open up the potentials of the Region to the world.</p>
      <p>“We want to put this fair on the international scene. We are trying to connect to embassies across West Africa. Ghana International Trade Fair has lots of international players and we want Volta’s to be the same.”    </p>
      <p>Exhibitors are expected from the other regions and from outside the country. Senior Minister Osafo Marfo is expected to perform the official opening on Tuesday, November 26, with the Minister of Trade and Industry in attendance.</p>
      <p>Dr Archibald Yao Letsa, the Volta Regional Minister, presented 30 LED street lights to the organisers to light up the event grounds.</p>
