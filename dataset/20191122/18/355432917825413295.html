      <h1>Warren adds Ayanna Pressley as campaign co-chair</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:23:15+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/max-greenwood" target="_blank">Max Greenwood</a></address>
      <p>Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.) on Friday announced three House freshmen as co-chairs for her presidential campaign, including Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/ayanna-pressley">Ayanna Pressley</a> (D-Mass.), a high-profile member of the group of progressive congresswomen dubbed “The Squad.”</p>
      <p>Democratic Reps. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/debra-haaland">Deb Haaland</a> (N.M.) and <a href="https://thehill.com/person/katie-porter">Katie Porter</a> (Calif.) will also join Warren’s campaign as co-chairs. </p>
      <p>“I’m deeply grateful to be standing shoulder to shoulder with Deb, Katie, and Ayanna as we fight for big structural change,” Warren said in a statement. “Together, we will continue building a grassroots movement to root out corruption in Washington and make our democracy work for everyone, not just the wealthy and well-connected.”</p>
      <p>“Deb, Katie, and Ayanna are relentless advocates for working families,” she added. “It’s an incredible honor to have these three persistent women on our team.”</p>
      <p>Pressley made news earlier this month when she announced her support for Warren, breaking from her fellow Squad members Reps. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/alexandria-ocasio-cortez">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> (D-N.Y.), <a href="https://thehill.com/people/ilhan-omar">Ilhan Omar</a> (D-Minn.) and <a href="https://thehill.com/people/rashida-tlaib">Rashida Tlaib</a> (D-Mich.), who endorsed Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.) in the Democratic presidential primary.</p>
      <p>All three congresswomen named to Warren’s campaign leadership on Friday were elected to the House last year on progressive platforms. </p>
      <p>Haaland, a former chair of the New Mexico Democratic Party, became one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress in 2018 along with Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/sharice-davids">Sharice Davids</a> (D-Kan.). </p>
      <p>Porter threw her support behind Warren’s campaign last month, choosing the Massachusetts senator over her home-state Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a> (D-Calif.), who is also seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.</p>
