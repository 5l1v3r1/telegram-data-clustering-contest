      <h1>Michigan State at Rutgers: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:07:33+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>If Michigan State wants any chance at playing in a bowl game this season, it’ll need to win on the road this weekend against Rutgers.</p>
      <p>Michigan State began the season with a 4-1 record, but then Mark Dantonio’s team went on to lose four-straight games. This includes a blown 28-3 lead to Illinois and embarrassing performance against Michigan. The longtime Spartans head coach has <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/michigan-state/mark-dantonio-asked-imichigan-state-coach-in-2020">faced questions about his job</a>, with these recent struggles.</p>
      <p>Rutgers hasn’t looked solid by any means, either. However, the team is in a tough spot since it’s being led by interim head coach Nunzio Campanile.</p>
      <p>The Scarlet Knights had their hands full against the Ohio State Buckeyes last weekend, but they did actually score 21 points which is more than most analysts predicted.</p>
      <p>Although the Spartans have looked anemic on offense over the past few weeks, they remain heavily favored to defeat the Scarlet Knights.</p>

      <p>Here are the details for this weekend’s Michigan State-Rutgers game:</p>
      <p><b>Game Time: </b>12:00 p.m. ET</p>
      <p><b>Channel: </b>FS1</p>
      <p>
        <b>Spread: </b>
        <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/michigan-state-vs-rutgers-odds-2019-college-football-picks-predictions-from-proven-computer-model/">Michigan State -20.5</a>
      </p>
      <p><b>Over/Under: </b>43.5</p>
      <p><b>Announcers: </b>John Strong, Evan Moore</p>
      <p>This might be Rutgers’ final chance to win a Big Ten game this season, especially since it has to go on the road to face Penn State next weekend.</p>
      <p>With Brian Lewerke struggling at quarterback over the last month for Michigan State, it’s possible that an upset takes place in New Jersey.</p>
      <p>Do you think Michigan State finally gets back in the win column, or will Rutgers pull off the upset?</p>
