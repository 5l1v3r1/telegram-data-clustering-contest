      <p>The International Film Festival of India (IFFI) has been every Indian filmmaker’s paradise ever since it was founded in 1952. It has grown in stature over the years, gaining a reputation as one of the most important film festivals in Asia.</p>
      <p>A platform that showcases critically acclaimed films, IFFI also provides a competitive space for Indian regional cinema.</p>
      <p>The golden edition in Goa marks the many milestones the festival has achieved. The first-ever IFFI was organised by the Films Division, Government of India, with the patronage of India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.</p>
      <p>The festival is also said to be the first international film event held anywhere in Asia.</p>
      <p><b>Looking back</b><br/>IFFI was not always held in Goa. It started off in Bombay (now Mumbai), with the United States participating, and featuring 40 features and 100 short films.<br/>Later, the fest was taken to Madras (now Chennai), Delhi and Calcutta<br/>(now Kolkata).</p>
      <p>The Competition Category was added to the festival in its third edition where Sri Lankan film ‘Gamperaliya’ received the first Golden Peacock Award.<br/>The festival grew bigger by its fifth edition, where it was the only Indian member of FIAPF (Fédération Internationale des Associations de Producteurs de Films), a body that regulates international film festivals. IFFI was classified as an ‘A’ grade festival.</p>
      <p><b>IFFI goes to Goa</b><br/>The festival moved to Goa — a land of sun, sand and sea — in 2004. The state government played a significant role in bringing the festival from Trivandrum to Panaji. Though the small coastal state initially faced criticism for not having the right infrastructure and a thriving film culture, the edition took off well.<br/>Soon enough, infrastructural changes like the new Patto bridge and INOX multiplex helped clear the path for Goa to continue playing the host.<br/>The state’s film culture expanded with a number of Konkani films being made every year. Around 12 of them made it to the Panaroma category of Indian cinema at IFFI.</p>
      <p><b>From 23 to 70+ countries</b><br/>The festival which began with entries from 23 countries now has over 200 films from 76 countries. Russia is the country of focus. </p>

        <b>Kannada filmmakers who frequent IFFI</b>
      </p>
      <p>Some renowned directors of the Kannada film industry have visited the festival earlier. And they were impressed. </p>
      <p><b>‘Experience broadened my horizon’</b><br/>The filmmaker was a regular at the festival when he was a student.<br/>Hemanth says, “It was nice to be able to watch more than 30 films in a span of 10 days, for a minimal rate. The experience broadened my horizon in terms of storytelling. It was a great learning experience for aspiring filmmakers.”<br/>The ‘Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu’ director adds that Goa adds a different vibe to it. “If one of my films makes it to the festival, it will be a great honour,” he says.<br/>— Hemanth Rao, director</p>
      <p><b>‘IFFI encourages people to make better films’</b><br/>The director visits IFFI as often as possible. “I couldn’t make it this time as I am busy with a shoot at Chamrajnagar.”<br/>He terms the festival “a fantastic experience”. “It is a great opportunity to watch films from various cultures. The movies offer a perspective into how one can narrate stories,” he says.<br/>A festival which has been around for 50 years by itself influences and encourages people to make better films, he says.<br/>— B Suresh, director</p>
      <p><b>‘Good experience’</b><br/>The ‘Prithvi’ director attended the festival when his films ‘Putti’ and ‘Anthyam’ were screened at the event.<br/>“I attended as a delegate. Everything was organised and it felt like a good holiday. I watched a couple of films and it was a good experience,” he says.<br/>— Jacob Verghese, director</p>
