      <p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — France’s armed forces minister has given a forceful speech warning of the dangers of U.S. disengagement in the Middle East.</p>
      <p>Florence Parly made the comments Saturday, addressing the annual Manama Dialogue in Bahrain.</p>
      <p>Parly says while the Persian Gulf is “accustomed to the ebb and flow of U.S. involvement,” America has not pushed back against Tehran after a summer of tensions sparked by President Donald Trump withdrawing unilaterally from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers.</p>
      <p>She said: “When the mining of ships went unanswered, a drone got shot (down). When that in turn got unanswered, major oil facilities were bombed. Where does it stop?”</p>
      <p>Parly said France will continue to speak to Iran. But she also stressed: “We will stand by our allies. You can count on us.”</p>
