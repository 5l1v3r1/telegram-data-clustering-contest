      <p>The club's leadership and coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer recently met to discuss transfer targets for next year, according to <i>Manchester Evening News</i>.</p>
      <p>The English publication claimed that the Red Devils are keen to sign more young, English players for their squad and have earmarked a fullback, a midfielder, a forward and a striker in this regard.</p>

      <p>United reportedly have four clear English targets, although they recognise that it will be difficult to get all four. Leicester City's Ben Chilwell and James Maddison are understood to be favourites for Solskjaer, while the club is also keen on Jadon Sancho and Declan Rice.</p>
      <p>It is believed United have received positive signals from Sancho's camp, with the Borussia Dortmund sensation reportedly telling friends he wants to return to Manchester.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer also wants to add another player up front after Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez both left Old Trafford in the previous transfer window, and the club might turn to a short-term solution in Mario Mandzukic, who could join from Juventus in January.</p>
