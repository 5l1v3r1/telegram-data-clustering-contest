      <p>The results of a special <b>Eurobarometer</b> survey published by the <b>European Commission</b> show that 60% of <b>Europeans</b> feel that they personally benefit from international trade, 16 percentage points more than 10 years ago at the time of the previous poll. The survey also revealed that 71% of respondents believe that the EU is more effective in defending their countries' trade interests than these countries acting on their own.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>54% of respondents suggest that the main priority of the EU trade policy should be to create jobs in the EU. Defending EU environment and health standards has also become important to <b>Europeans</b>, half of the respondents consider it a priority. This is 20 percentage points more than in 2010. More than half of <b>Europeans</b> recognise at the same time that the EU trade policy has already been taking into account the social, environmental and human rights impacts within the EU and worldwide.</li>
        <li>Three quarters of <b>Europeans</b> agree we need international trade rules.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Six in ten say that they trust the EU to conduct its trade policy in an open and transparent manner.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>54% of those considering international trade beneficial for them put it on awider choice of products, while 36% sees price reduction as the most important advantage. These benefits seem to be more tangible for younger respondents and those with a higher level of education and income.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>one third of those questioned think that it is na√Øve to expect that other countries will follow trade rules. More than half of the respondents think that the EU should increase import duties on non-EU countries or businesses that do not play by international trade rules.</li>
      </ul>
