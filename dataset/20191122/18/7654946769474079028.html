        <i>On NBC’s “The Good Place,” Chidi Anagonye loves nothing more than a good philosophical discussion. William Jackson Harper, the 39-year-old actor who plays him, would rather be hitting the drums. “I play with a band called the US Open,” Harper tells The Post. “It’s just for fun.” These days, you’ll find him in the new legal thriller “Dark Waters,” co-starring Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway. “Texas feels very far away from me now,” says the Dallas native, who moved to New York 15 years ago and now calls Clinton Hill home. Here are his favorite weekend hangs.</i>

      <p>On Friday night, I will probably go to dinner with my girlfriend, Ali. For a special dinner, we like <a href="https://www.thefinchnyc.com/">the Finch</a>. They have very subtle, simple, meticulously rendered food without being too pretentious. It’s got more of a local vibe. We’ll probably then grab a cocktail somewhere, like <a href="http://tookeralley.com/">Tooker Alley</a> in Prospect Heights. I usually go for the Jala-Piña: pineapple rum, serrano pepper-infused syrup, plus orange and cherry liqueurs.</p>
      <p>On Saturday morning, we usually get up and go for a workout at <a href="http://tabataultimatefitness.com/">Tabata Ultimate Fitness</a>. The trainers are upbeat and positive and funny, but they destroy me and my girlfriend. We’re just a sweaty puddle of nothing by the end of it.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.buckmason.com/">Buck Mason</a> is my absolute favorite place to shop. It’s kind of grown-up clothes for dudes of a certain age who haven’t completely given up. I maybe have one of everything they’ve ever released in the past couple years.</p>
      <p>Our favorite place for coffee on Sundays is <a href="https://clementinebakery.com/">Clementine Bakery</a>. It’s one of those lattes that you get that is just perfectly creamy — you don’t have to do anything to it. We usually grab one of those and sip it on the way to Fort Greene Park, so we can be as alert as we need to be for our dog, Chico, and the workout he gives us.</p>
      <p>There’s this great Jamaican spot called <a href="http://www.taylormadejamaicaneatery.com/">Taylormade</a> that has some of the best jerk chicken I’ve had in the city. I hadn’t had Jamaican food until I moved here. The first time I tried it, I realized it was the best chicken I ever had. “This is jerk chicken? I’ve been messing around all these years!” Now any time I see a new Jamaican spot within a mile radius of my place, I’m going to give it a shot.</p>
