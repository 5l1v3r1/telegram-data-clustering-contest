      <p>It is alleged the 34-year-old raped a woman, 20, in Sutherland Lane, near the University of Glasgow’s library in the early hours of October 31.</p>
      <p>He has also been charged with sexually assaulting another woman on October 17, and a third on October 24.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Suzanne McNulty of the Public Protection Unit in Govan said: “Officers in Glasgow carried out enquiries following a reports three woman had been the victim of sexual assaults</p>
      <p>in the West End between 17 and 31 October.</p>
      <p>“A 34-year-old man has now been charged in connection with two sexual assaults on 17 and 24 October, and a serious sexual assault on 31 October.</p>
      <p>“In every serious crime reported to police, officers carefully consider whether or not it is appropriate to proactively make the circumstances public.</p>
      <p>“This is continually assessed throughout the investigation to ensure the safety of the wider public is protected.”</p>
      <p>“We will continue to liaise with Glasgow University and the surrounding communities as part of our continued investigations into this.”</p>
      <p>The case was committed for further examination and Singh was remanded in custody.</p>
      <p>His court appearance comes after Glasgow students were warned to “stay safe” around campus following alleged sexual assaults.</p>
      <p>University of Glasgow chiefs issued an "important security message" during the week to reassure students that security procedures were being put in place.</p>
      <p>Increased guard patrols have now been brought in around the campus and improved lighting has been installed.</p>
      <p>In a social media warning, uni bosses said: "Incidents like this are rare and student and staff safety is of the utmost importance to the University.</p>
      <p>"We work extremely closely with Police Scotland and we have increased security patrols and improved lighting on campus.</p>
      <p>"If you have any concerns or information to report, please contact our security team on 0141 330 4282 or Police Scotland 101."</p>
