      <p>According to <a href="http://www.chinapress.com.my/?p=1813248">China Press</a>, the incident happened at Shah Alam Section 25 at about 7am on November 14th. <b>The victim, a 23-year-old Indian national, and his friend were walking to work when four men pulled up in a red Proton Saga to kidnap and rob both of them.Â </b></p>
      <p>Luckily, the victimâ€™s friend managed to escape from the kidnappers and asked a colleague for help. They lodged a report with the police and a manhunt was launched to look for the suspects. Just two hours after the abduction, Shah Alam OCPD Asst Comm Baharudin Mat Taib said that a team of officers from the Shah Alam Serious Crimes (D9) unit managed to locate and rescue the victim.</p>

      <p>He said that the kidnappers had even tried to blackmail RM2,000 from the victim. When the police managed to track down the suspects, they were in their Proton Saga and realised that the police were on their trail. They stepped on the accelerator to try and get away, but when that failed, they tried to ram police personnel with their vehicle.</p>
      <p><b>Fortunately, the police were not injured and the officersÂ fired three shots at the vehicleâ€™s back tyres and managed to stop them.</b> As a result, the car overturned into a ditch and the police managed to rescue the victim. They arrested the four kidnappers and seized six mobile phones as well as RM10.</p>

      <p>ACP Baharudin added that all four of them were friends and one of them was only 17 years old. <b>He was in the midst of his SPM exams and this was their first kidnapping attempt.</b> One 19-year-old is self-employed while another two accomplices, a 19-year-old and a 29-year-old, are unemployed.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old has a long list of previous criminal prosecutions including armed robbery, extortion, burglary and drugs. The suspects have currently been remanded and the case is being investigated under Section 323 of the Penal Code for assault and Section 365 of the same code for abduction.</p>
