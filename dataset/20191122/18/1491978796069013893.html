      <h1>Brighton v Leicester City: match preview</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:09:53+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/22/Guardian%20Staff" target="_blank">Guardian Staff</a></address>
      <p>Brighton will be without their captain, Lewis Dunk, for the match against Leicester. The centre-back serves a one-match ban after receiving five yellow cards. Adam Webster, who should be fit after an ankle injury, could replace Dunk in the side and will be tasked with containing Jamie Vardy. Brighton’s manager, Graham Potter, described the Leicester striker as ‘a top centre-forward, who does not need too many chances to score’ but his side have won their last three home games and so should be full of confidence. His counterpart at Leicester, Brendan Rodgers, believes the recent international break will not interupt the form of his side – they have won five out of six in all competitions. “I think it is important when players come back from international duty to press the reset button again,” he said. <b>Rich Flower</b></p>
