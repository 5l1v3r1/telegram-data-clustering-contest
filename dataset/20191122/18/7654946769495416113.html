      <h1>Yankees claiming Jacoby Ellsbury went behind their backs for treatment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:52:12+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:52</time> by <a rel="author">Ken Davidoff and George A. King III</a></address>
      <p>The Yankees are expected to officially file paperwork on Friday, once Jacoby Ellsbury clears release waivers, with the intent of converting Ellsbury’s contract from guaranteed to non-guaranteed, multiple industry sources told The Post. The <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/yankees-filing-grievance-to-owe-jacoby-ellsbury-less-money/">basis of the endeavor</a> is the Yankees’ contention that Ellsbury, who missed the entire 2017 and 2018 seasons due to multiple injuries, received medical treatment without the Yankees’ authorization for multiple years.</p>
      <p>Such an effort, if successful, would absolve the Yankees of paying Ellsbury the $26 million they still owe him, with a $21 million salary for 2020 and a $5 million buyout of a $21 million team option for 2021. It’s also possible that the Yankees could attempt to recoup some of the $127 million they already have paid him.</p>
      <p>Ellsbury, represented by Scott Boras, can file a grievance to challenge this initiative. If the grievance cannot be settled between the two sides, then it goes to an independent arbitrator for resolution.</p>
      <p>The case brings to mind Carlos Beltran’s dispute with the Mets in 2010, when Beltran underwent surgery on his right knee. The Mets contended that Beltran, a Boras client at that time, did so without the team’s consent. Ultimately, the team backed down on its threats to litigate.</p>
      <p>Boras is currently shopping stud free agents like pitchers Gerrit Cole and Stephen Strasburg that could help the Yankees next season. While both the Yankees and Boras are experienced enough to mutl-task, the Ellsbury situation certainly throws a compelling ingredient into the dynamics.</p>
