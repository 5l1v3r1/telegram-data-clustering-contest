      <p>Michael J. Pollard, a character actor best known for roles in 2003’s “House of 1000 Corpses” and 1967’s “Bonnie and Clyde,” has died. He was 80.</p>
      <p>His death was announced by rock star and filmmaker Rob Zombie, who directed Pollard in his role as Stucky in the cult film.</p>
      <p>“We have lost another member of our ‘HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES’ family. I woke up to the news that Michael J. Pollard had died,” Zombie, 54, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RobZombie/photos/a.385845778322/10157096581963323/?type=3&amp;theater">wrote on Facebook</a>. “I have always loved his work and his truly unique on screen presence. He was one of the first actors I knew I had to work with as soon as I got my first film off the ground. He will be missed.”</p>
      <p>The post was accompanied by a photo of several cast members of the film on set including Sid Haig, Pollard and Irwin Keyes, who have all died, as well as podcaster-comedian Chris Hardwick, 47, the host of AMC’s “Talking Dead.”</p>
      <p>“I can’t believe all three of my friends in this picture are now gone,” Zombie added.</p>
      <p>Haig, who played Captain Spaulding in Zombie’s debut film and its 2005 sequel, “The Devil’s Rejects,” <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/23/sid-haig-star-of-devils-reject-and-jackie-brown-dead-at-80/">died in September</a>. He was also 80. Haig starred in the follow-up movie in Zombie’s horror film franchise, “3 From Hell,” alongside Zombie’s wife, Sheri Moon Zombie, and Bill Moseley, in 2019.</p>
      <p>Keyes, who also starred in “The Warriors,” “Friday the 13th” and Woody Allen’s “Stardust Memories,” died at 63 in 2015 of complications caused by acromegaly, a pituitary gland disorder he had all his life.</p>
      <p>Pollard, who was born in Passaic, NJ, played C.W. Moss in “Bonnie and Clyde” opposite Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway. His role in the classic film earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.</p>
