      <p><b>Tori Spelling</b> is on the “verge of a breakdown” after the <i>90210 </i>reboot was canceled? That’s the rude rumor in a tabloid this week. <b>Gossip Cop</b> found it false.</p>
      <p>The <i>National Enquirer</i> claims that Spelling is “torn up” after Fox announced that <i>BH90210</i> wouldn’t receive a second season. Calling the show “toast,” the tabloid asserts that it was originally created to help clear Spelling’s debts and its imminent demise has her on the cusp of a total breakdown. “Tori was counting on her payday from the show to get her out of debt — and now she’s watching the gravy train roll away without her!” a source tells the magazine. “She was hoping that it would reestablish her as a bankable TV star, but the horrible reviews and quick cancellation have tramped on those plans, too!”</p>
      <p>The outlet then takes several jabs at Spelling’s financial situation with a few cruel insults before returning to the actual focus of the piece. “Tori collapsed in tears when she heard the show was getting the ax,” another insider adds. “Now she’s wailing to anyone who will listen that she doesn’t know how she’s going to feed her five kids!” The tabloid even sinks so low as to refer to her children as “mouths to feed” instead of kids in a photo caption.</p>
      <p>Rather than rely on totally nameless and untraceable sources, <b>Gossip Cop</b> reached out to Spelling’s spokesperson. The actress’s rep, who’s authorized to speak on her behalf, is going on the record with us to deny the made-up accusations. We’re exclusively told, “Tori is very busy currently working on her new series, <i>Tori Tried and True</i>, as well as being in pre-production on a movie she co-created with her producing partner, Jennie Garth.” It’s ridiculous to assume she was basing her entire future on a single project.</p>
      <p><b>Gossip Cop</b> already busted this narrative a few weeks ago when <i>OK!</i>, a sister publication of the <i>Enquirer</i>, claimed <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/tori-spelling-bh90210-second-season-debt/">Spelling needed a second season of <i>BH90210</i> to pay off debts</a>. As we pointed out then, Spelling has addressed her financial troubles before. She’s completely capable of feeding her family and providing for her kids, and at a certain point, it gets especially offensive to continuously imply otherwise.</p>
      <p>It’s also important to note that the <i>Enquirer</i> is the same tabloid that accused <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/tori-spelling-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-rhobh/">Spelling of being “too poor” for the <i>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i></a>. The gossip media has clearly found its favorite angle for stories about the actress, but no matter how often they repeat the narrative, that doesn’t make it true. <b>Gossip Cop </b>will keep fact-checking these ludicrous claims.</p>
