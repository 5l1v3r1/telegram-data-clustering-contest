        <b>The bitcoin cryptocurrency has been on the rise since January 2019, increasing its market value by almost twofold in the last 11 months. Now, something unexplained has happened, leading to a sharp fall in the value of the blockchain-backed digital currency since yesterday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The world’s most famous cryptocurrency has plunged to a six-month low over the course of the last 24 hours, and analysts remain puzzled as to the reasons for the dramatic crash.</p>
      <p>The price of bitcoin has slumped to less than $7,400 for the first time since May, while reaching its lowest market value point of less than $7,000 on Bitstamp on 22 November and ultimately falling  by more than 10 percent over the course of the day. </p>

      <p>​While it looks like the downtrend will continue, cryptocurrency analysts have been unable to articulate clear reasons for the sudden crash, fearing that a further plunge of bitcoin to $6,800 cannot be fully ruled out, according to CoinDesk estimates.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency that has dropped dramatically in the last 24 hours, with ethereum, ripple, and bitcoin cash also experiencing losses of between 5 to 15 percent of their value.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin had managed to increase its market value by almost twofold since January 2019, when its price was less than $4,000, prompting hopes that it would continue to rise, especially after China <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201911061077240306-china-reverses-decision-to-crack-down-on-bitcoin-mining-industry/">openly reversed its stance</a> on cryptocurrency and the application of blockchain technology in the country.</p>
