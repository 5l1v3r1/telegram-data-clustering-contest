      <p>Cars lined up around the Civic Center as fire and police departments helped the mayor and event sponsors give out the turkeys.</p>
      <p>They were given to representatives from local soup kitchens, senior citizen groups, churches, housing authority sites, and non-profits, among others.</p>
      <p>Monroe Mayor Jamie Mayo said it was a small way to give back to the community.</p>
      <p>"This is a time to give back because we're thankful to God for all of his blessings," he said. "There's so many individuals who are in need of so many different things and this is just a small piece of what we do to be able to give back to the community."</p>
