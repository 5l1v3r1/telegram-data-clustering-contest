      <p>The adventure business, established in 2001, was also named as finalist in the Best Education/Learning Team of the Year.</p>
      <p>The awards ceremony recognised the people and companies behind inspiring school trips.</p>
      <p>Go Ape! saw off stiff competition from the likes of Legoland Windsor, Alton Towers and The Eden Project.</p>
      <p>Rebecca Mayhew founder of Go Ape said: "This is the third year running we've won at these awards.</p>
      <p>"It's really nice to be recognised by school children and teachers alike who have an amazing experience when they come on a Go Ape school trip."</p>
      <p>Ms Mayhew said GoApe had welcomed more than 53,000 students to its sites around the country this year.</p>
      <p>Activities operate in all seasons and weathers, ranging from zip treks to ground-based teamwork activities.</p>
      <p>Based in Bury St Edmunds, Go Ape has developed forest adventures and created more than 1,000 jobs across the UK and USA.</p>
