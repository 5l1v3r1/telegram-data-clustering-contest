      <h1>SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's heartbreaking miscarriage and why she spoke out about it</h1>
      <h2>The SNP leader will appear on the BBC leaders' debate at 7pm tonight along with Jeremy Corybn, Boris Johnson and Jo Swinson</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jane Lavender, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon became the first woman to hold her position when she was elected as the First Minister of Scotland in 2014.</p>
      <p>She had been a member of the Scottish Parliament since 1999 and was former leader, Alex Salmond's deputy between 2004 and 2014.</p>
      <p>But when the 'Yes' campaign was defeated in the Scottish referendum and Salmond resigned, Sturgeon was elected into the top job.</p>
      <p>She will now stand toe-to-toe in tonight's leaders' debate at 7pm on BBC One with Tory leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a>, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> and Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson.</p>
      <p>Now 49, despite her political acheivements, Sturgeon has been quizzed for almost all of her career about why she has never started a family.</p>

      <p>She opened up about a devastating miscarriage she and her husband, Peter Murrell, chief executive officer of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a>, suffered nine years ago when she was aged 40.</p>
      <p>Sturgeon took the decision to reveal her harrowing miscarriage because of the constant questions she had faced in the hope it would "challenge some of the assumptions and judgements that are still made about women - especially in politics - who don't have children".</p>
      <p>The SNP leader revealed some of the hurtful comments she had received during her time in politics.</p>
      <p>She said: "The assumptions that people sometimes make is that I have made a cold, calculated decision to put my career ahead of having family, and that's not true. Sometimes things happen in life, sometimes they don't."</p>
      <p>Sturgeon has always insisted she didn't want to be defined by her miscarriage but that she didn't want young girls to think she had sacrificed becoming a mother for her political career.</p>

      <p>And she insisted she hoped, even had her pregnancy not ended in heartbreak, that she would still be in the position she holds today.</p>
      <p>In an interview for the book Scottish National Party Leaders, she opened up about why she had chosen to speak out about her experience.</p>
      <p>Sturgeon said: "If the miscarriage hadn’t happened, would I be sitting here as first minister right now? It’s an unanswerable question. I just don’t know.</p>
      <p>"I’ve thought about it, but I don’t know the answer. I’d like to think yes, because I could have shown that having a child wasn’t a barrier to all of this, but in truth I don’t know.</p>
      <p>“Having a baby might have so fundamentally changed our lives that things would have taken a different path, but if somebody gave me the choice now to turn back the clock 20 years and say you can choose to start to think about this much earlier and have children, I’d take that.</p>

      <p>"But if the price of that was not doing what I’ve gone on to do, I wouldn’t accept that, no.”</p>
      <p>Tragically, Sturgeon was still in the early stages of her pregnancy when she miscarried,</p>
      <p>She and her husband, Peter, had been preparing to tell their friends and family the happy news.</p>
      <p>Despite her miscarriage, Sturgeon bravely attended a public engagement shortly after on January 3, 2011.</p>
      <p>It was to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Ibrox disaster, where 66 Rangers fans were crushed to death.</p>

      <p>She waited five years - amid the barrage of questions about why she hadn't had children - before she addressed what had happened.</p>
      <p>Following the revelation, Sturgeon tweeted: "By allowing my own experience to be reported I hope, perhaps ironically, that I might contribute in a small way to a future climate in which these matters are respected as entirely personal – rather than pored over and speculated about as they are now.</p>
      <p>"There are many reasons why women don't have children.</p>
      <p>"Some of us simply don't want to, some of us worry about the impact on our career - and there is still so much to do, through better childcare, more progressive working practices and more enlightened attitudes, to make sure we don't feel we have to choose.</p>
      <p>"And sometimes, for whatever reason, having a baby just doesn't happen - no matter how much we might want it to.</p>
      <p>"For me, as for many women, all of these things have been true at different times of my life - the point is that judgments and assumptions shouldn't be made about what are personal choices and experiences."</p>
