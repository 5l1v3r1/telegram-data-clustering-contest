      <p>HALIFAX — Canada's defence minister says he doesn't see China as an adversary ahead of a weekend security conference of western countries expected to focus heavily on the Asian nation.</p>
      <p>Harjit Sajjan says while there are significant challenges in Canada's relationship with China — including the detention by the Chinese of two Canadians — now is the time to work toward solutions.</p>
      <p>Several of the sessions at the Halifax International Security Forum will deal with what many geopolitical experts see as an emerging threat.</p>
      <p>Forum president Peter van Praagh went further than Sajjan in his assessment, saying China can be characterized in a variety of ways from competitor or strategic competitor to adversary.</p>
      <p>Van Praagh says he thinks it's clear that Canada and China do not share the same interests.</p>
      <p>He says Canada and its democratic allies in Europe and Asia have a different world view, and the message ahead of the forum is that it's time to recognize that fact in order to be properly prepared to deal with it.</p>
