      <p>Popular reggae-dancehall musician Shatta Wale has rained insults on popular blogger Ameyaw Debrah over comments he made about his Grammy nominations.</p>
      <p>In his usual rants on social media, the “Melissa” hitmaker, used unprintable words the blogger and other media personnel who claimed he is not a Grammy nominee but a participant.</p>
      <p>Shatta Wale stated that he cannot comprehend why some media people feel he doesn’t deserve the nominations but will have reacted differently if it was Sarkodie.</p>

      <p>This comes after Shatta Wale in a series of tweets revealed that he has earned a nomination at the Grammys due to his collaboration with American Music Star Beyonce on her Lion King Album.</p>
      <p>However, Uk-based Ghanaian musician Fuse ODG is of the view that some people are bent on discrediting Shatta Wale’s Grammy nominations which does not make sense to him.</p>
      <p><i>“How is it that Shatta Wale is on a Beyoncé album, how is it that all these artists and producers are on an album and you are trying to discredit them, how does it make any sense”,</i> Fuse ODG asked.</p>
      <p>According to Fuse ODG, Shatta Wale was part of the production of the album therefore he is a nominee.</p>
