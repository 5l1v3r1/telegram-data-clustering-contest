      <h2>The 41-year-old stepped down as Scottish Tory leader in August and now Davidson says she will soon be an ex politician.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:34:54+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:34</time> by <a rel="author">Torcuil Crichton, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/torcuil-crichton/</a></address>
      <p>Ruth Davidson has confirmed for the first time that she will not stand for the Scottish parliament again in 2021.</p>
      <p>At an event on Friday the former Scottish Conservative leader described herself as “an ex-journalist and soon to be ex politician”.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a charity lunch hosted by journalists, Davidson said: “I enjoyed being a journalist and I loved being leader of the Scottish Conservative Party so I would like to thank everyone in this room for the last 20 years, the first decade on one side of the wall, and the second on the other and I am terrified of having to try and find a real job in 18 months time.”</p>
      <p>Previously Davidson said it was “unlikely” that she would continue at Holyrood, although this still leaves the door open for a return to frontline politics in the future as an MP at Westminster.</p>
      <p>Last month Davidson faced mounting <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/ruth-davidson-urged-quit-holyrood-20713500">calls to quit as an MSP</a> over her £50,000 a year second job with a PR firm which <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/ruth-davidson-turns-down-50k-20749096">she later gave up.</a></p>
      <p>It has since emerged that she has set up her own consultancy business and will be paid to deliver TV analysis on election night.</p>
      <p>Davidson <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/ruth-davidson-quits-scottish-conservative-19027056">stepped down as leader</a> of the Scottish Conservative Party in August after eight years in charge.</p>
      <p>The mum of one was widely credited for turning round the fortunes of the Tories north of the border and she has been tipped as a future UK Tory party leader.</p>
      <p>The MSP for  <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh Central</a>  stepped down as leader after disagreeing with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> over his initial pursuit of a no-deal Brexit although she stated her decision to quit was due to personal reasons.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old had backed Remain in the 2016 EU referendum and clashed Johnson during a TV debate before the vote.</p>
      <p>The rift between Davidson and Johnson deepened in July when  <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/david-mundell-sacked-boris-johnson-18770254">David Mundell was sacked</a>  as Scottish Secretary by the new Prime Minister and replaced with Brexiteer Tory MP Alister Jack.</p>
