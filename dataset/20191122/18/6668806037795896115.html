      <p>The Anees Bazmee directed Pagalpanti has hit the theatres today. Starring Anil Kapoor, John Abraham, Arshad Warsi, Illeana D’Croz, Kriti Kharbanda, Urvashi Rautela and Pulkit Samrat the film is a leave-your-brains behind ensemble comedy. Receiving mixed reactions from the critics, the film is expected to have a decent opening collection.</p>

      <p>With a reported occupancy rate of 20-25 per cent spread over 2000 screen for its first show, the film had a below-average opening in multiplexes. It needs strong evening shows to make up for the day. The trade analysts predict the first-day opening to be anywhere between Rs. 7 to 10 crores. The film does not have any tough competition at the theatres with Bala in its final leg and Marjaavaan fading at the ticket counters.</p>
