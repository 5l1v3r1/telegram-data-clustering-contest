      <h1>Jon Jones halts feud with Israel Adesanya until potential fight in 2021</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:41:13+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:41</time> by <a rel="author">Jose Youngs</a></address>
      <p>UFC light heavyweight champion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/47/jon-jones">Jon Jones</a> has had enough of middleweight champion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4366/israel-adesanya">Israel Adesanya</a>.</p>
      <p>For the last several months, the two fighters have traded jabs through both the media and the internet, with neither one hiding their disdain for the other’s lifestyle. While Jones made it clear he was more than willing to welcome the 185-pound champion to the 205-pound division in order settle their differences, Adesanya made it known he wants to defend his new title in 2020 before their inevitable clash in 2021.</p>
      <p>Too bad that hasn’t stopped the verbal sparring.</p>
      <p>On Friday afternoon, Adesanya took to Twitter to poke fun at Jones’ past cocaine usage. Less than 24 hours later, Jones took to his own social media to respond before declaring he was done with this planned rivalry until they actually had a fight lined up.</p>

      <p>Jones (25-1, 1 NC) is currently expected to put his light heavyweight title on the line against another undefeated pugilist in <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4111/dominick-reyes">Dominick Reyes</a>. While nothing has been confirmed, their title is expected to headline the UFC’s upcoming February card in Houston.</p>
      <p>Adesanya (18-0) is coming off a violent KO win over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1900/robert-whittaker">Robert Whittaker</a> at <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1053/ufc-243">UFC 243</a> in October, claiming the undisputed middleweight title in the process. While he was expected to challenge <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3984/paulo-henrique-costa">Paulo Costa</a> next, an injury to the Brazilian has led to serious talks about a potential title defense against <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/387/yoel-romero">Yoel Romero</a> in 2020.</p>
