        <b>As the races countdown, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/nico-hulkenberg">Nico Hulkenberg's</a> F1 career draws ever nearer to its conclusion and the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/renault-f1-team">Renault</a> driver has admitted he's not ready to retire and he still loves the pinnacle of motorsport.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hulkenberg will be replaced by Esteban Ocon at Renault next season with the constructor getting a French driver to represent them. In ten seasons in Formula 1, Hulkenberg has achieved one pole position, two fastest laps and 511 career points but has never won a race or achieved a single podium.</p>
      <p>The German has admitted he will miss Formula 1 but insists he can live with it after ten years in the sport.</p>

      <p><i>"To be honest, at the moment it does not look like an available place for 2020. I think Williams is not the right cockpit for me and I'm not the right man for them right now,"</i> Hulkenberg said in an interview with Martin Brundle on Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"I'm not retired, I love Formula One and what I do here, I love the competition.</i>
