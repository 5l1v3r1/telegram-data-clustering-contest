      <p>FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/VOWG_p.DE">VOWG_p.DE</a>) premium unit Audi (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/NSUG.DE">NSUG.DE</a>) wants to cut thousands of jobs to fund a costly transition to electric vehicles, but talks with powerful labor representatives have hit a logjam, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.</p>
      <p>Volkswagen tapped former BMW (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/BMWG.DE">BMWG.DE</a>) executive Markus Duesmann to take the helm at Audi from April next year after the German premium brand lost key engineering know-how and influence in the wake of the 2015 diesel-cheating scandal.</p>
      <p>Weekly magazine Der Spiegel on Friday said Audi is pushing for 4,000 to 5,000 positions to be eliminated in negotiations, which are led by Audi’s interim boss Bram Schot.</p>
      <p>Audi, which has a 61,000 strong workforce in Germany, declined to comment, as did its works council.</p>
      <p>A sticking point is the demand by organized labor to extend an existing moratorium on forced redundancies from 2025 until 2030, the sources said.</p>
