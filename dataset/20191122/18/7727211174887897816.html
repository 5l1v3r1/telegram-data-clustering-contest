      <h1>Horse Power: Bristol De Mai can win the Betfair Chase for a third time at Haydock Park</h1>
      <h2>Nigel Twiston-Davies' grey can land the Grade One feature on Merseyside while Lisnagar Oscar, Gortroe Joe, Burton's Well and Ballinsker may also score</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/chris-wright/" target="_blank">Chris Wright</a></address>
      <p>Bristol De Mai can maintain his 100% record at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/haydock-racecourse">Haydock Park</a> and land a third successive victory in the Betfair Chase (3pm) on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Nigel Twiston-Davies’ grey has won four times in four starts at the Merseyside track, including two successes in the Grade One feature in 2017 and 12 months ago.</p>
      <p>He faces just three rivals this afternoon and although some of them are progressive stayers coming out of novice company, Bristol De Mai can secure a hat-trick of Betfair Chase wins and move him to within one of Kauto Star’s record four triumphs.</p>
      <p>The nine-year-old is at his best in soft conditions at Haydock having also won two Grade Twos, the Altcar Novices’ Chase in 2016 and the Peter Marsh Chase in 2017, there. And although the ground is much better than usual he can also go well on the good to soft going.</p>
      <p>He only has three other chase victories away from Haydock – at Warwick, Leicester and in the Charlie Hall at Wetherby – but has also run well in defeat, particularly when third in the Magners Cheltenham Gold Cup at the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/cheltenham-festival">Cheltenham Festival</a> back in March.</p>
      <p>He failed to shine at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/aintree-racecourse">Aintree Racecourse</a>’s Randox Health <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/grand-national">Grand National</a> meeting the following month. But he is horse who goes well at this time of year and with his Haydock record he will be hard to beat.</p>
      <p>Colin Tizzard’s Lostintranslation – a Grade One novice winner at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/aintree">Aintree</a> in April – looks the biggest danger, but he may have to settle for second.</p>
      <p>Rebecca Curtis’ Lisnagar Oscar can win the Grade Three Betfair Best Odds On ITV Races Stayers’ Handicap Hurdle (2.25pm).</p>
      <p>Two smart stayers in Sam Spinner and Paisley Park won this race in the past two seasons en route to bigger successes.</p>
      <p>Lisnagar Oscar may not be quite up to that level yet, but the six-year-old looks progressive. He ran well at both the Cheltenham and Aintree festivals, but has failed to win in two starts over the bigger obstacles so far this season.</p>
      <p>A return to hurdling should suit and he can score in a hugely-competitive contest.</p>
      <p>Evan Williams’ Ballinsker can make it two from two over hurdles by following up his Ludlow win with another in the Listed Read Paul Nicholls Exclusively At Betfair Newton Novices’ Hurdle (12.05pm).</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Venetia Williams’ Burton’s Well returned after a long lay-off to give owner Trevor Hemmings another win at Aintree last time and he can follow up in the Cashout In-Play With Betfair Handicap Chase (12.40pm).</p>
      <p>Liverpool owner John Neild retired Splash Of Ginge after he was pulled up at Cheltenham last weekend, but he can celebrate victory at one of his ‘home’ tracks with The Hollow Ginge – trained by Twiston-Davies – in the Betfair Exchange Graduation Chase (1.15pm).</p>
      <p>Dan Skelton’s consistent Gortroe Joe probably doesn’t win as often has he should but he has a chance to get back in the winner’s enclosure in the Racing Only Bettor Betfair Podcast Handicap Hurdle (1.15pm).</p>
      <p>He went chasing last year but back over the smaller obstacles, he ran well to be third at Wetherby last time and can go a couple of places better.</p>
      <p>David Pipe’s Know The Score may take the Better Value On The Betfair Exchange Stayers’ Handicap Chase (3.35pm).</p>
      <p>At Ascot Altior can take the step up in trip in his stride and come out on top in his battle with Cyrname in the Grade Two Christy 1965 Chase (2.05pm).</p>
      <p>It is an intriguing race with just one other runner. But Altior’s class may see him triumph.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Skelton may score with Roksana in the Grade Two Coral Hurdle (Registered As The Ascot Hurdle) (2.40pm); and the Paul Nicholls-trained Capeland may make up for his disappointment at Sandown last time with victory in the Gerard Bertrand Hurst Park Handicap Chase (3.20pm).</p>
      <p>Others who may in at Ascot are the Nicky Henderson-trained Pym in the Ascot Chase (A Novices’ Limited Handicap) (12.55pm); Fergal O’Brien’s Oscar Rose in the Trisoft Mares’ Handicap Hurdle (1.30pm); and Soaring Glory in the Ascot Standard Open National Hunt Flat Race (3.50pm).</p>

      <h3>Donald McCain's Cloudy Dream on road to recovery</h3>

        <figcaption>Smad Place (left), ridden by Wayne Hutchinson, beats Cloudy Dream (right) to win the 188Bet Monet’s Garden Old Roan Ltd Handicap Steeple Chase at Aintree Racecourse on Sunday, October 29 2017 Picture by Martin Rickett/PA</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Cloudy Dream is slowly on the road to his return to action after being out for 13 months.</p>
      <p>The Donald McCain-trained nine-year-old has not run since being injured when third to Frodon in the Old Roan Chase at Aintree in October 2018.</p>
      <p>That was his first start for the Merseyside-born trainer after joining McCain from Ruth Jefferson’s yard. He has has been recuperating at his owner Trevor Hemmings’ stud in Lancashire, and is now back cantering.</p>
      <p>Cheshire-based handler McCain said: “I’m in touch with Mick Meagher (racing manager) at Trevor Hemmings’ place. He’s still there and is being ridden every day. It’s got to be decided how soon he comes back into training. Obviously the spring is more important than the autumn.</p>
      <p>“We’ll just see, but he picked up that knock in the Old Roan last year, and it just took time to settle. I  know he’s cantering every day. Mick knows the horse better than me - and I’ll just leave it to them, and they will decide the best way forward.”</p>
      <h3>Nicky Henderson's Might Bite may make return at Aintree Racecourse</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Nicky Henderson is still deciding whether Might Bite’s return to action will be at Aintree or Huntingdon.</p>
      <p>The 2017 King George VI Chase winner, who was also second in the Gold Cup, disappointed last season. He failed to fire in three starts but he could return in either the Many Clouds Chase at Aintree two weeks today or the Peterborough Chase  at Huntingdon 24 hours later. Henderson said: “Last season he never jumped as well as he did before</p>
      <p>“Nico (de Boinville) wants to come back to two and a half miles and we don’t often disagree.</p>
      <p>“However, he thinks the Peterborough would suit him and I think the Many Clouds at Aintree would be the right race for him.</p>
      <p>“That is the time of year he will appear.”</p>
