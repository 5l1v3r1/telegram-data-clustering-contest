      <p>Nico Hulkenberg has ruled out retiring from Formula One but knows he will not be on the grid next season after being axed by Renault.</p>
      <p>Esteban Ocon will take Hulkenberg's seat at the Enstone squad next year, partnering Daniel Ricciardo.</p>
      <p>A move to Haas was mooted as a possible option for the German driver, but Romain Grosjean was retained along with Kevin Magnussen.</p>
      <p>Williams are the only team not to have finalised their line-up for 2020, with Robert Kubica leaving after one year back in the sport as George Russell's team-mate.</p>
      <p>Hulkenberg has accepted he is surplus to requirements, yet says he is not finished in the sport.</p>
      <p>"It looks like, in all honesty, that there is no seat available now," he told Sky F1.</p>
      <p>"I guess it [Williams] is not the right seat for me and the timing... I'm not the right person for them to be honest.</p>
      <p>"I'm not retiring. I love Formula One, I love what we do here, I love the competition. I can live with it. I think 10 years is a long time and a fair share of Formula 1.</p>
      <p>"But for sure I'm going to miss it next year when I have to watch the first race on TV."</p>

      <p>Hulkenberg reiterated that reverting to being a reserve driver is not an option.</p>
      <p>"To go and do that, when you're young and at the beginning, and I did that in 2011, I think that's the right and obvious thing to do," the 32-year-old said.</p>
      <p>"To do that when more advanced in the career, it's kind of a hard one to take when you've raced so many years consecutively. That role, I'm not sure about."</p>
      <p>Hulkenberg is 13th in the 2019 driver standings with 37 points ahead of the season-ending race in Abu Dhabi on December 1.</p>
