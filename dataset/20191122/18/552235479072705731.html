      <p>A NEW Mitsubishi Mirage supermini has been unveiled and will have its world premiere at the Thailand International Motor Expo 2019 on November 28.</p>
      <p>Built in Thailand, the latest Mirage comes with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/mitsubishi">the Japanese company’s</a> new-look nose and an updated interior. The car has LED combination headlights while the rear has a wider and more stable look with a squared-off treatment for the bumper corners.</p>
      <p>Inside, there’s a new design to the cockpit with soft-feel cloth and a carbon pattern to the instrument cluster and window switch panel, while upper trim levels are upholstered in a sporty-look fabric-synthetic leather combination.</p>
