      <p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is making some big, structural additions to her 2020 presidential campaign's leadership team.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Warren announced that Reps. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), Katie Porter (D-Calif.), and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) would be joining her campaign as co-chairs. All three congressmembers were first elected in 2018's Democratic House sweep, and have remained in the spotlight ever since.</p>

Haaland stirred up controversy with her endorsement given that she was the first Native American woman to be elected to Congress, and Warren made a <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/821241/elizabeth-warren-apologized-cherokee-nation-dna-test">campaign video</a> to show a DNA test proved she had a Native American ancestor several generations back.</p>
