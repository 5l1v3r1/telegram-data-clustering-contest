      </p>
      <p>Following the delay of the Department of State Service (DSS) to release Omoleye as ordered by the Federal High Court in Abuja, the human rights activist has filed a lawsuit against the agency.</p>
      <p>In the suit which included Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation and minister of justice, Sowore demanded the sum of N500 million over what he described as 'unlawful detention and violation' of his human rights.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Sowore also stated in his application that the refusal of the DSS to release him was a violation of his right to fair hearing, health, freedom of movement and freedom of association.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The suit read in part: <i>“A declaration that the detention of the applicant from November 7, 2019 till date in violation of the order for his release made on November 6, 2019 is illegal as it violates his fundamental right to liberty guaranteed by Section 35 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended)."</i></p>

      <p>Even more, the activist called upon the court to issue <i>“An order of perpetual injunction restraining the respondents from further violating the applicant’s fundamental rights in any manner whatsoever and however without lawful justification.”</i></p>
