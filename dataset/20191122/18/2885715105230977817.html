      <p>The fourth Ramnath Goenka Memorial Lecture, delivered by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, summed up last 70 years of India’s foreign policy choices and how India must respond in today’s world. Elaborating on the subject, ‘Beyond the Delhi Dogma: Indian Foreign Policy in a Changing World’, Jaishankar challenged past choices — from dealing with China on boundary issues and handling Pakistan to managing ties with the US while also critiquing India’s decision to go to the UN on Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Five months into his new role, the scholar-diplomat-turned-minister spelt out <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/narendra-modi">Narendra Modi</a> government’s approach to foreign policy in his first major speech in New Delhi on November 14.</p>
      <p>“Napoleon once said that history is a version of past events that people have decided to agree upon. The world that awaits us not only calls for fresh thinking, but eventually, a new consensus at home as well. Putting dogmas behind us is a starting point for that journey,” he said.</p>

      <p>Later, in a conversation with C Raja Mohan, Contributing Editor, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>, and Director, Institute of South Asian Studies, National University of Singapore, Jaishankar, discussed India’s policies, strengths and challenges in today’s complex, rapidly-changing world. “I mean I would rarely fault Indians for taking risks, I would mostly fault them for timidity you know. A Sehwag is a sort of exception, he is not the rule,” he said.</p>
      <p>At the event, the welcome remarks was given by Raj Kamal Jha, Chief Editor, The Indian Express, who said that Jaishankar blended hard-nosed diplomacy with a soft touch.</p>
      <p>Delivering his vote of thanks, Anant Goenka, Executive Director, Express Group, said that Jaishankar’s lecture showcased his “incredible knowledge and expertise”.</p>
