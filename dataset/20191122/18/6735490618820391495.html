      <p>The $8.5 million total puts the Disney animated sequel on track for a weekend-dominating box office total with around $130 million.</p>
      <p>Back in 2013, the original “Frozen” opened wide to nearly $94 million domestically and went on to earn $1.28 billion worldwide.</p>
      <p><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/box-office/box-office-frozen-2-beautiful-day-21-bridges-1203413662/">These numbers suggest</a> that “Frozen 2” will be the biggest domestic opening since “The Lion King” in July with $191.8 million.</p>
      <p>Even Panic! At The Disco are getting in on the “Frozen” fun as they release the video for their song from the film, “Into The Unknown”. The tune is expected to be the next “Let It Go” or “Do You Want To Build A Snowman”.</p>
