      <p>US President <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump </a>said on Friday that a trade deal with China is "potentially very close" and that he stands with both the people of Hong Kong and Chinese President Xi Jinping amid massive protests in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>Trump, speaking on Fox News Channel's "Fox &amp; Friends," said he had made clear to Xi that "this can't be an even deal" because of China's trade surplus with the United States.</p>
      <p>"We have to stand with Hong Kong but I'm also standing with President Xi," said Trump.</p>
