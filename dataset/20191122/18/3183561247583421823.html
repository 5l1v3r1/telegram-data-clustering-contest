      <p>Good news for anyone who loves online security but doesn't want their personal phone number tied to it.</p>
      <p>Twitter is finally giving users the option to use two-factor authentication (2FA) without handing over their digits.</p>
      <p>There are some caveats, though.</p>

      <p>From today you can enable 2FA on your Twitter account with just a security code generating app such as Google Authenticator. Previous to this you still had to add a phone number if you chose to use a security app with your account.</p>
      <p>But the service could still do with some improvements. As <a href="https://9to5mac.com/">9To5Mac explains</a>, some security keys such as Yubikey still necessitates a second authentication, such as a phone number, for 2FA to work. The reason behind this is because the keys are only supported by the web version of Twitter.</p>
      <p>So if you're a security key fan but prefer the Twitter app or Tweetdeck, you're probably out of luck for awhile. Fingers crossed that this changes in the future.</p>
      <p>To enable 2FA on Twitter shit the <b>'More'</b> button on the sidebar and then go to <b>Settings and Privacy</b> -&gt; <b>Account</b> -&gt; <b>Security</b> -&gt;<b>Two-Factor Authentication</b>. You'll then be able to choose your preferred method.</p>
