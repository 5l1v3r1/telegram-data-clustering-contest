      <p>Nov. 22 (UPI) -- Retired Army veteran Andrei Jones of Greensboro, N.C., has won the lottery twice over the course of two months.</p>
      <p>Jones won $150,000 on Thursday from a Cashword <a href="https://twitter.com/nclottery/status/1197897335919063042">scratch-off ticket</a> after he had won $1,000 from a scratch-off ticket in September.</p>
      <p>"I'm blessed," <a href="https://nclottery.com/NewsBlogDetails/2019/11/22/Greensboro-Army-veteran-wins-lottery-twice-in-two-months">Jones said</a>. "I was blessed before, but now I'm even more blessed."</p>
      <p>Jones at first wasn't aware that he had won as after he scanned his ticket, it told him to visit the lottery headquarters.</p>
      <p>He claimed his cash prize in Raleigh on Thursday, taking home $106,126 after federal tax withholdings.</p>
      <p>Jones said that he will use the money to save for the future and to pay off his wife and daughter's cars.</p>
