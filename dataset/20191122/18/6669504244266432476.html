      <p>TORONTO - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ontario Premier Doug Ford headed into their Friday meeting saying they planned to talk about the issues they agree on â€” and avoid the ones where they don't see eye-to-eye.</p>
      <p>Trudeau said he expected a good meeting and a cordial conversation that would focus on areas like health care and investments in infrastructure, such as transit systems.</p>
      <p>Ford echoed those sentiments by saying he too wanted to focus on areas of co-operation.</p>
      <p>The premier said he is very aware that some of the people who voted for him also voted for the prime minister.</p>
      <p>Those voters, he said, expect the two to find a way to work together, despite their political differences.</p>
      <p>The two made the comments at the start of their meeting on Parliament Hill this morning.</p>
      <p>The sit-down is the latest in a series of in-person talks Trudeau is having with provincial leaders after receiving a minority mandate last month.</p>
      <p>Trudeau has already met with leaders including Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe and Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister.</p>
      <p>On the campaign trail, Trudeau frequently tried to warn voters away from Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer by linking him to Ford, whose popularity has been sinking in recent polls.</p>
      <p>Ford said Thursday in Toronto that he would bring a collaborative message to the meeting, despite the frequent attacks the prime minister launched against him during the federal election campaign.</p>
      <p>Ford said he is eager to work with the federal government on a number of files, including health care and public transit.</p>
      <p>Towards the end of the photo opportunity before the meeting, Trudeau and Ford shared a laugh as the premier talked about learning French.</p>
      <p>Ford asked Trudeau if he knew any good teachers. Trudeau joked that he used to be one, but is a little busy these days.</p>
