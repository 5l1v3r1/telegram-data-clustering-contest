      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/katie-price/">Katie Price</a> has branded Emily Atack ‘fishy’ after the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> star’s STI jibe.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the Extra Camp host took aim at Katie and her ex-husband Peter Andre by joking that presenters Joel Dommett and Adam Thomas needed to get tested for diseases after plunging into the same pool that the former couple first kissed in.</p>
      <p>And it seems this hasn’t sat well with the mother-of-five as she has hit back in a heated rant on Instagram.</p>

      <p>Threatening to come to the jungle herself, the 41-year-old spat at the camera: ‘So Emily Atack, you think it’s clever do you to slag me off? Who are you anyway?’</p>
      <p>Dressed in a camo print outfit with a rucksack by her side she continued: ‘Looks like I’m coming for you.</p>

      <p>‘Because if you’ve got something to say don’t say it behind my back on telly say it to me. Because all the men you’ve been with don’t have good things to say about you.’</p>
      <p>Wafting her nose at the lens, she wrapped up her clip by saying: ‘Phwoar, fishy!’</p>
      <p>He video comes after the Inbetweens actress mocked the glamour model on the ITV competition’s sister show, Extra Camp.</p>
      <p>Joel and Adam took a dip in the show’s iconic lake, but it seems the 29-year-old wasn’t impressed.</p>

      <p>‘This is where Katie Price and Peter Andre had fondles,’ Joel proudly boasted to his buddy.</p>
      <p>But back in the studio, Emily teased: ‘I hope you boys went to the clinic after being in that pool.’</p>
      <p>Looking slightly lost for words, her new presenting pal quickly rose to the banter, as he named one of Pete’s songs.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Oh yeah, we did,’ he told the former I’m A Celeb contestant: ‘And we tested positive for Insania.’</p>
      <p>Emily giggled behind her flashcard at the joke as Joel showed there were no hard feelings by adding: ‘Love you, Peter.’</p>
