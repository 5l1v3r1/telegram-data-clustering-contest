      <p>New starting blocks, lane ropes and flags have been officially unveiled in time for Perth City Swim Club’s annual championship this weekend.</p>
      <p>Two of the required five backstroke start ledges have also been purchased, with sponsors being sought to fund the remaining three at a cost of £1,500.</p>
      <p>Several thousand pounds has been spent on the new equipment which will be used for club members and the wider public using the training pool.</p>
      <p>Funding was a joint effort between Live Active Leisure and Perth City Swim Club, supported by the Jimmie Cairncross Trust.</p>
      <p>A significant chunk was raised through a sponsored bungee jump by club captain Freya Bannerman and fundraising committee member Pamela Renfrew.</p>
      <p>Perth City Swim Club president Carol McPartland said: “This has been a monumental effort on behalf of a lot of people to reach this point.</p>
      <p>“As well as the obvious benefit to our club swimmers, the new equipment is there for the people of Perth who use the pool, too.</p>
      <p>“The old starting blocks and lane ropes were no longer fit for purpose and age had simply caught up with them.</p>
      <p>“To be honest, they have been needing replaced for some time but specialised equipment like this doesn’t come cheap.</p>
      <p>“That’s why it has been so important to make it a joint effort and why everyone should be delighted that we have finally reached this stage.</p>
      <p>“To be able to announce this ahead of our 2019 club championships is very satisfying and should give everyone involved a timely boost.”</p>
      <p>The championships run over two days, and more than 100 of the club’s swimmers will take part.</p>
      <p>The participants range from the club’s youngest swimmers, aged seven and eight, right up to world champion and Olympic medallist Stephen Milne.</p>
      <p>Stephen will be presenting the medals on Sunday, while former club swimmer Scott McLay will be returning to present the medals tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Scott – who is Scotland’s most successful Commonwealth Youth Games athlete ever – is breaking off from preparations for next month’s European Short Course Championships in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>He said: “I learned to swim at Perth Leisure Pool and my first club was Perth City Swim Club. My earliest memory is of winning a medal at my first club meet at the age of seven.”</p>
      <p>Head coach Ann Dickson described the championships as her favourite meet of the year and said she was looking forward to seeing everyone in action.</p>
