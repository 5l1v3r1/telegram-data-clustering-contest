        <i>Mother and daughter die in Winchombe, as Met Office forecasts further downpours</i>
      </p>
      <p>Two people, believed to be a mother and daughter, have died after a tree fell on their car, as the Met Office issued more weather warnings for the weekend.</p>
      <p>Police were called to the incident shortly after 10pm on Thursday near the Cotswolds town of Winchcombe. Gloucestershire police said a formal identification had not yet taken place but the victims were believed to be a 16-year-old girl and her 56-year-old mother.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman said the next of kin had been informed. “The road remains closed north of Ford and at the Toddington roundabout while police are at the scene. It is not yet known when the road will reopen and motorists are asked to find alternative routes.”</p>
      <p>The wet weather was expected to continue into the weekend, with the Met Office issuing four <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/warnings-and-advice/uk-warnings#?date=2019-11-22">weather warnings</a> for Saturday across the UK, including parts of north-east England where heavy flooding has caused significant disruption in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Heavy and persistent rain was due to start in south-west England from 12pm on Friday and last until 6pm on Saturday. About 20-30mm of rain was expected across the region, though the upper slopes of Dartmoor in south Devon could receive 40-50mm. The average rainfall for Devon and Cornwall during November is 135-145mm.</p>
      <p>Yellow warnings have been issued in north-eastern England and parts of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland">Scotland</a>, which will also experience wet weather throughout Saturday.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Met Office said areas such as Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire would face persistent rain arriving from the south early on Saturday and lasting through much of the day. The rain would be heavy at times, especially on hills where it could reach 40-50mm.</p>
      <p>The region is still recovering from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/20/uk-flood-victims-criticise-government-for-belated-response">heavy flooding that caused devastation in many communities</a> in the past two weeks.</p>
      <p>Met Office data up to 17 November shows that Nottinghamshire has had 189% of its monthly average rainfall already – the highest proportion of any UK county.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/warnings">Environment Agency</a> has 45 flood alerts and six flood warnings in place, four of the warnings being in the north-east.</p>
      <p>Wet weather was expected to develop across north-east Scotland from Saturday afternoon. The Met Office said general rainfall of 20-40mm was likely through Aberdeenshire, and areas of high ground could receive 60-80mm, in addition to thawing snow.</p>
