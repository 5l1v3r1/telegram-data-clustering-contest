      <h4>Full Story</h4>
      <p><a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=S001196">Rep. Elise Stefanik</a>, a Republican from upstate New York who sits on the House <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/about/hpsci-minority-members.htm">intelligence committee</a>, has <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjy6rSE3f7lAhWoUt8KHUERDmoQ0PADMAF6BAgBEAk&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rollcall.com%2Fnews%2Fcampaigns%2Felise-stefaniks-rise-tests-new-gop-fundraising-platform-winred&amp;usg=AOvVaw3p-n_9RpVH886V4ybpGLx0">drawn</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOvPeZ3f7lAhXPVN8KHf0LDKIQxfQBCDowAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.syracuse.com%2Fnews%2F2019%2F11%2Ftrump-hannity-praise-elise-stefanik-she-raises-500000-in-2-hours.html&amp;usg=AOvVaw2tsiLaqnsgK8IgAcja_49q">attention</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/19/politics/elise-stefanik-conservative-hero/index.html">recently</a> for her role in the impeachment inquiry’s public hearings.</p>
      <p>She also has been the target of misinformation.</p>
      <p>A manipulated image circulating on social media makes it look like Stefanik was sticking up her middle finger at the end of a public impeachment inquiry hearing, but <a href="https://youtu.be/5lam6Ab2Rhs?t=373">video</a> from the Nov. 15 hearing <a href="https://youtu.be/VuzK3LdJtvc?t=23366">shows</a> that she never made that gesture. Rather, as Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, exited the chamber after giving testimony, Stefanik <a href="https://youtu.be/5lam6Ab2Rhs?t=373">looked</a> at a news video camera for a moment, then turned away.</p>
      <p>A still image from that short piece of footage was later doctored and then shared on Twitter. George Conway, a prominent critic of President Donald Trump and husband of Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway, was among those who <a href="https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1195803387171921922">retweeted</a> it and later deleted it.</p>
      <p>Conway had retweeted a post from Brian O’Malley, who later posted several tweets apologizing for the error. O’Malley, a writer and producer, posted this <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianJOMalley/status/1195817059491426305">tweet</a> addressed to Stefanik: “I erroneously posted an image of you that I believed was real. I deleted the image after it was exposed as a fake. I take full responsibility for what I did. I’ve spent the last 2 hours apologizing to all who saw it. I apologize to you most of all for my mistake.”</p>
      <p>But it had already migrated to Facebook, where screenshots of the tweet are being <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/MaddowShow/permalink/2671406862916894/">shared</a> as a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10218465840970450&amp;set=a.4381894658667&amp;type=3&amp;theater">meme</a>.</p>
      <p>Stefanik addressed the bogus image in a <a href="https://twitter.com/EliseStefanik/status/1195800462169128960">tweet</a>: “The photoshopped picture that the Leftist Twitter mob led by George Conway is circulating is FAKE – I’ve been so busy exposing Adam Schiff’s #regimeofsecrecy that I haven’t had time for a manicure in weeks!”</p>
