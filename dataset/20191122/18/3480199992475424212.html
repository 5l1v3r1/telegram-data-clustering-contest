      <p>The winner of Junior Bake Off 2019 has said he was “too stunned to cry” after being crowned.</p>
      <p>Fin, 13, from Manchester, won the coveted title during Friday night’s final on Channel 4.</p>
      <p>The Great British Bake Off’s junior spin-off saw 20 nine to 15-year-olds compete in a range of cooking challenges.</p>

      <p>Fin, who started baking with his grandmother and taught himself further using YouTube videos, rose to the challenge during two heats and a finals week.</p>
      <p>He said: “It was probably the most surreal thing that has ever happened to me.</p>
      <p>“The pause between announcing ‘and the winner is…’ to saying my name seemed to go on for ages.</p>
      <p>“My legs were shaking so much, and when I heard it was me, my legs collapsed with the sheer exhaustion of it all.</p>

      <p>“I was so overwhelmed as all the other bakers ran over to hug me. I pulled myself together and took the trophy from (judge) Liam.</p>
      <p>“My sister shed a little happy tear, my mum was in shock, and I was too when I heard my name, I think I was too stunned to cry.</p>
      <p>“It was one of the best days of my life.”</p>
      <p>Harry Hill hosted the show while judges Prue Leith and former Bake Off contestant Liam Charles were tasked with choosing this year’s winner.</p>

      <p>The four finalists’ last chance to impress came with the last Showstopper, a cake in the form of the Junior Bake Off trophy.</p>
      <p>Charles said: “His Showstopper was pretty much faultless, and that was his best cake of the series… He absolutely smashed it.”</p>
      <p>Leith added: “Fin absolutely deserved to win. He pushed himself as hard as he could and all his cakes were just absolutely wonderful.”</p>
