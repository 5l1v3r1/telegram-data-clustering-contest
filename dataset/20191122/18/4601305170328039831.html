        <b>“Intelligence officials believe that one of the people the Kremlin relied on to spread disinformation about Ukrainian interference was Oleg V. Deripaska, a Russian oligarch who had ties to Mr. Manafort.”</b>

      <p>In recent weeks, national intelligence officials have been explaining to senators and their aides that Russia has been engaged in a campaign for years to frame Ukraine as being responsible for Moscow’s hacking of our 2016 presidential elections.</p>
      <p>“Republicans have used similar talking points to defend President Trump in impeachment proceedings,” report <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/us/politics/ukraine-russia-interference.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share">the New York Times</a>' Julian Barnes and Matthew Rosenberg:</p>
      <blockquote>The Republican defense of Mr. Trump became central to the impeachment proceedings when Fiona Hill, a respected Russia scholar and former senior White House official, added a harsh critique during testimony on Thursday. She told some of Mr. Trump’s fiercest defenders in Congress that they were repeating “a fictional narrative” — and that it likely came from a disinformation campaign by Russian security services, which themselves propagated it.<br/><br/>In a briefing that closely aligned with Dr. Hill’s testimony, American intelligence officials informed senators and their aides in recent weeks that Russia had engaged in a yearslong campaign to essentially frame Ukraine as responsible for Moscow’s own hacking of the 2016 election, according to three American officials. The briefing came as Republicans stepped up their defenses of Mr. Trump in the Ukraine affair.<br/><br/>The revelations demonstrate Russia’s persistence in trying to sow discord among its adversaries — and show that the Kremlin apparently succeeded, as unfounded claims about Ukrainian interference seeped into Republican talking points. American intelligence agencies believe Moscow is likely to redouble its efforts as the 2020 presidential campaign intensifies. The classified briefing for senators also focused on Russia’s evolving influence tactics, including its growing ability to better disguise operations.</blockquote>
