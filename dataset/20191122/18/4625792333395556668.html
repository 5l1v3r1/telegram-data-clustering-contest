      <p>Comedian Ricky Gervais revealed that he will have lawyers review the jokes he plans on making while he hosts the Golden Globes prior to the event.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/im-strong-but-not-that-strong-ricky-gervais-reacts-to-being-called-a-boomer">Gervais</a>, 58, will host the 77th annual Golden Globes on Jan. 5, and it will be his fifth time hosting the award ceremony.</p>
      <p>“'I never do anything that terrible as it's on network television, but I do have to show my script to a lawyer at the last minute,” he said, via <i><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7714349/Ricky-Gervais-reveals-risqu-Golden-Globes-jokes-monitored-lawyers.html">The Daily Mail</a></i>. “They don't change anything because I know the law and what I can get away with. I've never libeled anyone, and I've never had a complaint upheld."</p>
      <p>Gervais remarked, "It's no trouble. It's easy!" in response to being asked if walking the line of controversy is worth it.</p>
      <p>The comedian's decision to host the awards show comes as many rival celebrity ceremonies, such as the Oscars and Emmys, had decided not to have any host after a slew got into <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a26444458/oscars-2019-controversies-explained/">hot water.</a> In announcing he'll host the Golden Globes, Gervais made a note to point out that he would not stray from his brand of comedy.</p>
      <p>“Once again, they’ve made me an offer I can’t refuse,” he said, according to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/ricky-gervais-host-golden-globes-2020-nbc-hfpa-1202783565/">Deadline<br/></a><br/>. “But this is the very last time I’m doing this, which could make for a fun evening.”</p>
