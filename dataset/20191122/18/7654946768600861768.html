      <h1>Big political donor faces new charges in Manhattan federal court</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:56:17+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:56</time> by <a rel="author">Emily Saul</a></address>
      <p>Los Angeles venture capitalist Imaad Zuberi — a big donor to both Democrats and Republicans who’s been charged in California with campaign finance violations — is set to face new allegations in New York, according to court papers.</p>
      <p>Federal prosecutors in Manhattan plan to charge Zuberi with obstruction of justice and failing to register as a foreign agent, according to a letter filed late Thursday by his own attorneys.</p>
      <p>The news comes as Zuberi is scheduled<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/22/major-trump-clinton-donor-to-plead-guilty-to-campaign-finance-violations/"> to plead guilty Friday</a> in California federal court to campaign finance violations and tax evasion relating to allegations he traded donations for political access.</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old venture capitalist has for years given millions to both Democrats and Republicans — shelling out $900,000 for Trump’s inaugural and also donating to Hillary Clinton.  It was not said in the California case what candidates the illegal funds went too.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for Zuberi asked a California judge Thursday to reschedule their client’s guilty plea to December, in order to “allow the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) to find a single voice – not New York and Los Angeles voices speaking over each other – so he can globally resolve all potential charges instead of being subject to serial prosecutions for the identical conduct by different offices of the DOJ.”</p>
      <p>They also accused the DOJ of “last-minute goalpost-shifting” in Zuberi’s case.</p>
      <p>The judge has not yet responded to the filing.</p>
      <p>A spokesman with the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office declined to comment, and the DOJ did not immediately return a message.</p>
