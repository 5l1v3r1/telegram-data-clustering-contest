      <h1>Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson's terrifying brush with death and why she's not a fan of Easter eggs</h1>
      <h2>Swinson will take part in the leaders' debate</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:15:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:15</time> by <a rel="author">Jane Lavender, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>At just 39, Lib Dem leader is both the first woman and youngest person to ever holdthe position.</p>
      <p>Born in Scotland, she was first elected to a become an MP in 2005, when she beat Labour's John Lyons.</p>
      <p>Not one to shy away from controversial topics, Swinson was vocal in her opposition to the Iraq War and the introduction of national identity cards.</p>
      <p>Swinson supports measures to help tackle climate change and the conservation of energy but in 2015 she lost her East Dunbartonshire seat to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a>.</p>
      <p>However, she was back in the House of Commons in 2017 and was elected to Party leader in May this year.</p>

      <p>She is one of five Party leaders going head to head in a televised debate at 7pm tonight on BBC One.</p>
      <p>Swinson will spend 30 minutes answering audience questions in the programme hosted by Fiona Bruce.</p>
      <p>She will be facing <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, Tory leader, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon.</p>
      <p>Swinson has held several senior positions within the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>, including Equalities Minister, and served as Nick Clegg's Parliametary Private Secretary when he was Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>Passionate about health care and environmental issues, Swinson has good reason to want to protect the NHS.</p>

      <p>Back in 2013 the Lib Dem leader, who has a peanut allergy, almost died when she had a reaction to eating a biscuit.</p>
      <p>She accidentally ate the snack, unaware it contained nuts, at a charity sale and went into anaphylactic shock.</p>
      <p>As she struggled from breath, doctors gave her adrenaline and she had to be treated in hospital.</p>
      <p>Swinson said at the time: "Almost instantly I felt a tingling sensation  so I knew I had unknowingly eaten a nut.</p>
      <p>"It's difficult to always know whether something contains nuts or not - and this time I got it wrong."</p>

      <p>The MP was rushed to Southern General Hospital in Glasgow by her mum, where she was injected with an Epipen.</p>
      <p>Ever prepared, Swinson had already written out what to do in case her throat became so swollen that she couldn't speak.</p>
      <p>Medics gave her steroid and oxygen and she was allowed home the following day.</p>
      <p>Swinson said: "It was a very scary experience. Lukcily, once you get the right treatment you recover very quickly from it - but the bottom line is that you don't get help, you can die."</p>
      <p>Another cause close to the politician's heart is unneccesary plastic packaging.</p>
      <p>She has campaigned specifically for Easter egg manufacturers to reduce the amount of plastic used each year.</p>

      <p>Swinson, releasing a report into why firms need to do more to cut down on the amount of plasticthey use, said: "Millions of us watched Blue Planet and witnessed the shocking levels of plastic waste in our oceans.</p>
      <p>"None of us want the packaging from our tasty Easter treats to contribute to ocean pollution.</p>
      <p>“It is disappointing that Easter Egg manufacturers have not been more proactive in reducing levels of plastic in their packaging, so I am calling on them to pledge to eliminate plastic in next year’s Easter Eggs.</p>
      <p>"If manufacturers truly want to cut the use of plastics they must sacrifice the presentation of their Eggs for the presentation of their values.</p>
      <p>“The plastic waste associated with Easter eggs is symptomatic of a much wider problem across consumer industries, where companies could and should be doing more to combat plastic waste.</p>
      <p>"Our oceans are precious - we all need to do our bit to help preserve them.”</p>
