      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/"><b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</b></a> has placed a strong emphasis on signing a striker in January following the club's failure to replace <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/romelu-lukaku/"><b>Romelu Lukaku</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alexis-sanchez/"><b>Alexis Sanchez</b></a> last summer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/man-united-have-three-man-shortlist-for-new-striker_380197.html">Reports have suggested</a> that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mario-mandzukic/"><b>Mario Mandzukic</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/erling-braut-haaland/"><b>Erling Braut Haaland</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/callum-wilson/"><b>Callum Wilson</b></a> are among the club's targets.</p>
      <p>According to the <i>Evening Standard</i>, Solskjaer is a big fan of the player and has urged the club to monitor his situation ahead of the upcoming window.</p>
      <p>Richarlison has impressed with his performances at Goodison Park, scoring 13 goals in the Premier League - including one against United - last season.</p>
      <p>Despite the recent resurgence in front of goal spearheaded by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/anthony-martial/"><b>Anthony Martial</b></a>, United's total of 16 goals from 12 league games has attracted criticism.</p>
