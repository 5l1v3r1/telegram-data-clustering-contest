      <p>CHRISTMAS has come early to Mayo this year.</p>
      <p>The festive lighting scheme has been switched in the county town of Castlebar a week earlier than usual to help boost shopping activity.</p>
      <p>The event has traditionally taken place on the last Friday of November in recent years but was moved forward in 2019 following consultations with the local retail sector.</p>
      <p>The ceremony at Market Square was performed by Councillor Michael Kilcoyne, cathaoirleach, Castlebar Municipal District.</p>
      <p>It attracted a big turnout of parents and children as they awaited the arrival of Santa. </p>
      <p>Entertainment was provided by Castlebar Concert Band under the direction of Mary Curran.</p>
      <p>The central feature of the lighting scheme is an eye-catching  Christmas tree.</p>
      <p>But there was controversy earlier this week when the first tree erected at the location got the thumbs-down on social media from local people and Mayo County Council wisely bowed to pressure to replace it.</p>
      <p>A nativity crib is also in place at Market Square.</p>
      <p>The Christmas Lighting Scheme will be switched-on in Ballina on Sunday evening.</p>
