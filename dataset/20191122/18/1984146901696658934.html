      <p>He made Lemington his life and strived to make it the best place to live.</p>
      <p>But now stalwart John Dawson has died at the age of 76 - leaving a legacy to be proud of.</p>
      <p>Dad-of-one John received an MBE in 2008 for being a lifelong volunteer at the Lemington Centre in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/lemington">Lemington</a>, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-upon-tyne">Newcastle</a>.</p>
      <p>He was given the accolade after decades of selfless devotion to his much-loved community centre, which provides everything from health care to fitness classes.</p>

      <p>In the 1970s Lemington Community Association was based in nothing but an old Portakabin and the £2m centre that stands today is a tribute to John’s years of fundraising.</p>
      <p>After receiving his MBE he said at the time: "Before it was more of a pastime but in the last few years it has become my life.</p>
      <p>"It’s come as a complete surprise. It’s nice to think someone thought of me and it’s a reflection of the work everyone does."</p>
      <p>John, who was a volunteer trustee at Healthworks, which runs from the Lemington Centre, died on Wednesday, November 21, in hospital.</p>
      <p>Now tributes are flooding in for John, whose wife Dorothy has in the past also volunteered at the centre.</p>

      <p>And leading the praise is Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner Kim McGuinness, who is also Labour Councillor for Lemington and a friend of John’s.</p>
      <p>On Facebook she wrote: "Devastated to hear that John Dawson has passed away. Throughout my years as a councillor in Lemington John has become a friend and always been so incredibly supportive. John was a wonderful man. He truly cared about people in his community.</p>
      <p>"John poured his heart and soul into the Lemington Centre and into being there for people of Lemington. He listened to people and was never short of new ideas about how to make the centre and Lemington even better.</p>
      <p>"My love and thoughts are with Dorothy and all of John’s family. Rest in Peace John."</p>
      <p>On Twitter Northumbria Police Central Engagement team @NPCENGTEAM posted: "So many happy memories of John from our times in Lemington and as part of the NPT there. What a legend."</p>
      <p>Paul Court, Healthworks CEO, said: "The staff and Board of Healthworks are incredibly sad following the death of John Dawson. We have sent our deepest sympathies to his family and friends. Many of our staff, including myself, had a very deep and longstanding friendship with John and his family and we are doing everything to support them during this very sad time.</p>

      <p>"John’s commitment to the Lemington Centre, the Friends of Lemington and Healthworks was unwavering. He worked tirelessly and selflessly for others.</p>
      <p>"John was a community champion, a charity fundraiser, a Trustee of Healthworks and instrumental in the development and building of the Lemington Centre. His work has touched the lives of many and he will be greatly missed by us all at Healthworks and the Lemington Centre.</p>
      <p>"When the time is right, and in consultation with John’s family, Healthworks will ensure a suitable way in which to remember him."</p>
      <p>On Facebook Craig Heeley said: "Such sad news. John made me hugely welcome in the community during my first few weeks and months in the Lemington community."</p>
      <p>Glenn Pendleton posted: "Great man."</p>
      <p>John leaves wife Dorothy, daughter Jane and his grandchildren.</p>
