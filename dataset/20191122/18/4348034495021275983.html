      <p>Ahead of Sean Price’s passing in 2015, the Brooklyn, New York veteran was said to be at work on several albums, including solo material and collaborative projects. Sean’s fourth solo album, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3xpY0WG5GkPed4rBYIbEMt?si=kgF3V0T1R8-zJzPMFaQX3g"><i>Imperius Rex</i></a>, eventually released in 2017. That Duck Down LP was <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2017/12/best-rap-albums-year-2017/">named by <i>Ambrosia For Heads</i> among the best of that year</a>. Other efforts have followed, including collaborative works with longtime affiliate Illa Ghee (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6AIg1vZi6umIf2cYAuR2Nr?si=wGBf1SCWRv6JHCHzT9lLgg"><i>Metal Detectors</i></a>) and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania producer Small Professor <i>(<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7nbUpUWMhOiwo67WqTU116?si=6wQ5QPU3S-unRztV3bCNwQ">86 Witness</a></i>).</p>
      <p>Another LP is now surfacing. P! and M.O.P.’s Lil Fame had been working on an album in 2015. <i>The Price Of Fame </i>will arrive December 20, according to Duck Down and Sean’s wife, Bernadette Price. <a href="https://smarturl.it/priceoffamealbum">The LP is available for pre-order</a>.</p>

      <p>Less than a month before his death, <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2015/07/sean-price-confirms-upcoming-album-entirely-produced-by-m-o-p-s-lil-fame-audio/">Sean told the <i>Southern Vanguard Radio Podcast</i> about plans</a> to release the LP with the fellow Brooklyn native. “It’s all Lil Fame, he’s the one producing,” P said at the time. “I’m doing a sh*t-load of rapping. It’s like a Fame producer album, but he do’ the choruses. I’m rhymin’ on it. He made all the beats. It’s crazy.” That recording is part of an animated promotional video that Duck Down used.</p>

      <p>Lil Fame (sometimes credited as Fizzy Womack) has produced for AZ, Wu-Tang Clan, Cormega, and others, outside of longstanding work with Mash Out Posse. He produced for Sean on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3UmJLsP5zoH3DqSErI1X7X?si=bnlWuuIpSACRqRS5MG3EFg"><i>Wu Chamber Music</i></a> compilation. As MCs, the pair worked together on albums by Statik Selektah, Snowgoons, and J-Love.</p>
