      <h2>Mr Corbyn, Boris Johnson, Nicola Sturgeon and Jo Swinson will get a grilling in the general election special - but hundreds of people turned up with just one leader on their mind</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:26:18+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:26</time> by <a rel="author">Mikey Smith, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mikey-smith/</a></address>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn gave an impromptu speech to hundreds of Labour supporters who had appeared outside the Question Time venue, cheering his name and shouting “Boris out.”</p>
      <p>The rapturous crowd, who had been standing in the cold for more than an hour in the hope of catching a glimpse of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> leader, hushed to near silence as Mr Corbyn spoke with neither notes nor a microphone.</p>
      <p>Waving his newly published manifesto, he said: “Thankyou Sheffield for being here tonight. Thankyou for the lovely city you are.</p>
      <p>“And thank you for your support for what we're doing to build a decent, fair society in Britain that cares for all, not just the few.”</p>

      <p>Supporters started to appear on the concourse outside Sheffield Students' Union more than two hours before the programme kicked off - undeterred by a constant drip of rain and chilly temperatures.</p>
      <p>As well as hundreds on the University concourse, more supporters lined the overpass stretching over the campus.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn added: "Above all, it's about what we do in the next three weeks to convince people that what we're putting forward is a radical manifesto, it is different and it will change society."</p>

      <p>A supporter on the overpass shouted: "Yes Jeremy. We'll keep the red flag flying."</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn went on: "And I want to do that because I'm fed up with the poverty, the homelessness, the food banks and the misery in so many people's lives."</p>
      <p>He said he wanted to ensure Britain's trade in the future is secure "in or out."</p>

      <p>Wrapping up his short speech, he said: "If <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> wants to go to Washington and do a deal with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> , I simply say this: Our NHS is not for sale."</p>
      <p>He waved to supporters and headed into the Octagon Centre to prepare for the debate, as the crowd chanted "not for sale" back at him.</p>
      <p>Asked how he felt after the speech, he told the Mirror: “Fine. Lovely people.”</p>

      <p>The BBC will tonight's two hour special which will see each party leader - Jeremy Corbyn, Boris Johnson, Nicola Sturgeon and Jo Swinson - take questions from a studio audience.</p>
      <p>Over the two hours, each leader will each be invited to take questions from the audience for thirty minutes.</p>
      <p>The BBC's standard Question Time host Fiona Bruce will be hosting - and pushing the politicians to answer the questions.</p>
      <p>On the show Fiona Bruce said:  “Question Time has a proud history of giving the public - the voters - the chance to put their points and questions directly to their elected representatives. That’s never more important than during an election campaign.</p>
      <p>"I’m very much looking forward to these special programmes."</p>
