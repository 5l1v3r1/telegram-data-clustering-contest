      <h1>PML-N slams govt for violating MNAs’ production order</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:54:33+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/303/our-correspondent/" target="_blank">Our Correspondent</a></address>
      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Friday criticised the government for not bringing the party’s incarcerated members to the National Assembly to the meetings of the house standing committees, terming it an attack on parliament.</p>
      <p>The PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb said Saad Rafiq was not brought to the house despite his production order, while Rana Sanaullah’s production order was not issued. “For this, the government of Punjab and prime minister Imran Khan would be held accountable,” she said.</p>
      <p>Addressing a news conference along with Murtaza Javeed Abbasi and chairman of the National Assembly Committee on Science and Technology Sajid Mehdi, she also accused the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) of “harassing” the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).</p>
      <p>She said that Prime Minister Imran was pursuing political vendetta for past two years. “He [Imran] cursed parliament when he was on container,” she said, referring to the PTI’s sit-in in 2014. “And now he has locked down the parliament.”</p>

      <p>She said that on November 7 the production order of Saad Rafiq was issued but he was not brought to the National Assembly. For Rana Sanaullah, the PML-N spokesperson added, even the production order was not issued.</p>
      <p>She reminded that former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has said that unless all production orders were issued, he would not go to the proceedings.</p>
      <p>Despite the production order, Saad Rafique was not brought to the science and technology committee meeting, she said. She said that the party would table a privilege motion in the production order issue.</p>
      <p>Aurangzeb said that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and former Punjab chief minister Shahbaz Sharif completed development projects worth trillions of rupees but not even single rupee corruption was proved against them.</p>
