      <p>Clement Lenglet has been ruled out of Barcelona's game at Leganes on Saturday (1pm) as domestic football resumes following the international break.</p>
      <p>The French defender felt a problem in his calf during Friday's training session and will not make the trip to Madrid with his teammates.</p>
      <p>Lenglet played 180 minutes in France's two Euro 2020 qualifiers last week against Moldova (2-1) and Albania (2-0). It seems he has paid the price.</p>
      <p>As is now normal, Barça's statement on the injury does not reveal how long they expect to be without the centre-back due to the problem.</p>
      <p>Barça B defender Ronald Araujo takes his place, with Gerard Pique, Samuel Umtiti and Jean Clair Todibo also options in the middle of defence.</p>
      <p>Pique is in the squad despite having been focused on the Davis Cup this week, which is taking place in Madrid and has been organised by his company Kosmos.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde also has problems in the full-back positions. Jordi Alba and Nelson Semedo are both injured, while Sergi Roberto is suspended.</p>
