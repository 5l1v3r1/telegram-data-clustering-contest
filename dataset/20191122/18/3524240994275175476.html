      <h1>Police in Benue discover three dead family members in a room</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:47:09+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:47</time> by <a rel="author">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The Benue Police Command on Friday confirmed the discovery of bodies of three members of a family in their room at North-Bank area of Makurdi metropolis.</p>
      <p>The State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Catherine Anene, who confirmed the bizarre happening to<i> News Agency of Nigeria</i> in Makurdi, said investigations were ongoing to unravel the cause of death.</p>
      <p>The PPRO also disclosed that a little girl was found in the room where the dead bodies were discovered, completely unhurt but too small to give useful information.</p>
      <p>She said the cause of death was still unknown but added that all the bodies had no physical injury to warrant an immediate determination of cause of death.</p>
      <p>She, therefore, appealed to members of the public with useful information to report to the nearest security agencies for necessary action.</p>
      <p>“The incident was reported today (Friday) and when our men rushed to the scene, we discovered three bodies — a man, his wife and son,” she said.</p>
      <p>Some of the neighbours described the deceased family members as “peaceful” and wondered what could have happened.</p>
