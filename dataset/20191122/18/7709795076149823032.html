      <p>Despite falling last time out, <b>WHOSHOTTHESHERIFF</b> was travelling well for a long way. The handicapper has nudged him up 2lb for this better race but Sean Quinlan is a good booking. Kateson will be well found in the market having been tried in better company and Project Bluebrook will be worth keeping an eye on.</p>

      <p>In what is set to be a titanic clash, the two-highest rated chasers in training go head-to-head in Berkshire. <b>ALTIOR </b>has never gone over this far and there is a slight quirk with some of his jumping, if you want to be overly critical. Yet the speed in which he pulls away on the flat should see him re-calibrate the ratings with the classy Cyrname.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Harry Skelton has deserted Diomede Des Mottes after he seemed certain to win last time out but found next to nothing off-the bridle. The one of most interest is <b>HIGHLAND HUNTER</b> who now has Paul Nichols as his trainer. He'll be happy on the soft ground and it's interesting that Sam Twiston-Davies gets the ride.</p>
      <p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>LAURINA </b>comes up against the boys having shown some admirable form in the Champion Hurdle and she will be a warm order to take this. Opposition looks thin on the ground and with the trainer having a 50% record in the last ten runnings of this race, the selection tightens up.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Despite there being only four runners, a case can be made for all four. Bristol De Mai loves it around here and will surely head the betting, whilst Frodon is only rated a pound lower but significantly wider in the market. Ballyoptic won the Charlie Hall Chase well but <b>LOSTINTRANSLATION</b> looks a real Gold Cup horse and can well and truly frank the form of a red-hot JLT at the Festival by taking this with a stellar round of jumping.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Quite a competitive race in which Capeland will surely be competitive after his unfortunate disqualification last time out. He re-opposes Diego Du Charmil here but the selection is another they both meet again in the shape of <b>CAID DU LIN</b>. His record around Ascot is decent and with a slight lowering in the weights he can make the most of the difference.</p>
      <p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Fairly uninspiring stuff to complete leg 7. With a run under his belt at a course not too dissimilar to this <b>MOVING IN STYLE</b> may just eke out enough improvement to take this. Know the Score has had two wind operations so that marks as a negative but Lake Romantic looks like a thorough stayer and could be a big player.</p>
