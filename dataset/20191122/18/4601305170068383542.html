      <h1>Sleeping inside one of Edward Hopper's hotel room paintings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:43:55+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/david_pescovitz" target="_blank">David Pescovitz</a></address>
      <p>As part of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts' "<a href="https://www.vmfa.museum/exhibitions/exhibitions/edward-hopper-american-hotel/">Edward Hopper and the American Hotel</a>" exhibition, the curators have created a brilliant installation and visitor experience that's seemingly made for Instagram. They built a physical version of Hopper's above painting "Western Hotel" (1957) and offered overnight stays inside the artwork. The <a href="https://www.vmfa.museum/calendar/events/hopper-hotel-experience/">overnight packages</a> sold out very quickly. The New York Times' Margot Boyer-Dry was one of the first guests:</p>
      <blockquote>Every detail here was inspired by Edward Hopper’s 1957 painting “Western Motel,” which has been brought to vibrant, three-dimensional life. The only thing missing is the mysterious woman whose burgundy dress matches the bedspread. But that’s where the museum guest comes in. <br/><br/>I was the second person to stay in the museum’s Hopper hotel room, essentially becoming its subject for a night. (Before it sold out through February, the room cost anywhere from $150 a night to $500 for a package, including dinner, mini golf and a tour with the curator.) My time there was short — a standard stay runs from 9 p.m. to 8 a.m. — and awkward. I had traveled all day to reach Richmond, and these pristinely basic quarters were the main event. Ultimately, it reminded me of every other hotel room I’ve ever stayed in...<br/><br/>Ellen Chapman, a Richmond resident who stayed the night before I did, was more focused on the novelty of an art overnight. “I’ve always had that childhood fantasy of spending the night in a museum,” she said. “The remarkable part for me was waking up, drinking my coffee and looking at this amazing exhibit right next to me.”</blockquote>
