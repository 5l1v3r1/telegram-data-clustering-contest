      <p>The football world on both sides of the Severn have been sending their best wishes to Christian Edwards, one of the few players to have played for both Bristol Rovers and Bristol City, who has suffered a suspected heart attack.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old collapsed at training session at Cardiff Met FC, where he is the manager, and is currently in hospital.</p>
      <p>Edwards was rushed to hospital on Thursday evening, and a statement from the Welsh Premier League side said they are hopeful for his recovery.</p>

      <p>"Cardiff Met FC are sending our best wishes to our manager Christian who last night suffered a suspected heart attack at training,” a statement from the club said.</p>
      <p>“We can confirm he is okay and under observation. We would like to thank you for your kind words and messages,” it added.</p>
      <p>A host of rival teams have sent their best wishes to the boss, who had a long career as a player in Wales and England.</p>
      <p>Caerphilly-born Edwards began his career at Swansea, before moving to Nottingham Forest for five years between 1998 and 2003.</p>

      <p>While at Forest, he went to four different clubs in five loan spells, including playing three games on loan at Bristol City in the 1998-99 season.</p>
      <p>He moved from Forest to Bristol Rovers in 2003, and was one game short of the 100 club in three injury-hit seasons at the heart of Rovers’ defence.</p>
      <p>He ended his career with a brief spell at Forest Green Rovers, before four seasons at Aberystwyth Town, where he began his management career.</p>

      <p>Edwards has taken Cardiff Met up four flights in the Welsh football pyramid, and they are now in the Welsh Premier League - and became the first British University men’s team to play in European competition this summer when they made the preliminary round of the Europa League.</p>

      <p>Aberystwyth Town tweeted their support, saying: "Aberystwyth Town Football Club extends its best wishes to Christian and hope for a speedy recovery.</p>
      <p>"If we can do anything to help please do let us know, including for those who were in training with Christian at the time."</p>
