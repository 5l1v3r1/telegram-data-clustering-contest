      <p>(Bloomberg) — Retail sales fell in September for the first time in three months, though the decline was less than economists had anticipated.</p>
      <p>Canadian retailers sold 0.1% fewer goods in the month as consumers spent less on motor vehicles and gasoline, Statistics Canada said Friday in Ottawa. That beat the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey for a 0.3% decline. Excluding motor vehicles, retail sales climbed 0.2%.</p>
      <p>In volume terms, which strip out the effects of price changes, September sales dipped 0.1%. Third quarter retail sales climbed 0.5% in volume terms, meaning they will contribute positively to quarterly output.</p>
