      <p>Serbia’s hopes of winning the Davis Cup for the retiring Janko Tipsarevic ended in tears and heartbreak after a quarter-final defeat by Russia in Madrid.</p>
      <p>Part of Serbia’s Davis Cup-winning team of 2010, 35-year-old Tipsarevic chose this week’s event as his career swansong.</p>
      <p>He had to watch from the sidelines as Novak Djokovic was subbed in alongside Viktor Troicki for the deciding doubles after Djokovic had levelled the tie at 1-1 with a 6-3 6-3 victory over Karen Khachanov.</p>

      <p>A dramatic contest against Khachanov and Andrey Rublev that saw Djokovic need treatment to his troublesome elbow and the Serbian pair argue with the umpire came down to a deciding tie-break.</p>
      <p>Serbia had three match points but could not take any of them, with Troicki scooping a horrible volley long on the third one, and Russia made them pay to reach the last four for the first time since 2008 with a 6-4 4-6 7-6 (8) victory.</p>
      <p>A distraught Troicki, who won the deciding rubber in the 2010 final, blamed himself, saying: “I probably feel the worst ever.</p>
      <p>“I never experienced such a moment in my career, in my life. And I let my team down, and I apologise to them.</p>
      <p>“We had chances to finish it. We didn’t do it. I messed up in the crucial moments.</p>
      <p>“God gave me once to be the hero, to win the Davis Cup in the deciding rubber. Now he took it away. I’m really, really disappointed in myself that I couldn’t hold my focus till the end and finish.”</p>
      <p>The press conference then became even more emotional when captain Nenad Zimonjic, who was also part of the winning team in 2010, turned the focus to Tipsarevic.</p>
      <p>He eventually composed himself enough to say: “There’s four players sitting here and I would say they are our golden generation. And I see it as an end because it’s Janko’s last match.</p>

      <p>“And your dream may be to go all the way to celebrate with a victory, but sometimes it doesn’t happen what you wanted to happen.”</p>
      <p>Tipsarevic, the only player not struggling to hold back tears, added: “I remember yesterday after the doubles one of your colleagues asked me what is the one thing that you can pull out from all these 20 years.</p>
      <p>“And what did I say? The one thing is not the victories or the losses, it is that this beautiful sport makes you f****** tough.</p>
      <p>“This emotion that you want to commit suicide after a day like this, and you go towards and against the wind, these emotions are the one thing that I can draw from all these 20 years that I was playing for the country and individual competition.</p>
      <p>“A few of the guys apologised to me. I don’t accept these apologies because none of them let me down all over these 20 years.</p>
      <p>“Everybody knows that they are like my brothers and I will be with the team in one or the other capacity and I would like to thank them all for being with me on this journey.”</p>

      <p>Serbia’s despair was Russia’s joy. Khachanov and Rublev have been playing as a two-man team following the late withdrawal through fatigue of US Open finalist Daniil Medvedev.</p>
      <p>They collapsed to the court in each other’s arms at the moment of victory and will take on Canada on Saturday for a place in the final.</p>
      <p>Rublev in particular has shone this week and it was his 6-1 6-2 victory over Filip Krajinovic that paved the way for victory.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old said: “Both teams could win, both teams had a lot of chances. It was just like a coin toss, and we won this coin toss.</p>

      <p>“It’s an amazing feeling to be part of this team, to play with them, now to be in the semi-final with them after so long a time. I’m happy I can perform really well, that I win my matches.”</p>
      <p>Rafael Nadal ensured hosts Spain did not follow Serbia out of the competition by winning singles and doubles in another late-night contest against Argentina.</p>
      <p>A minute’s silence was held before the tie for the father of Roberto Bautista Agut, who died on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Bautista Agut’s replacement, Pablo Carreno Busta, was beaten 6-7 (3) 7-6 (4) 6-1 by Guido Pella but Nadal thumped Diego Schwartzman 6-1 6-2 then teamed up with Marcel Granollers to defeat Maximo Gonzalez and Leonardo Mayer 6-4 4-6 6-3.</p>
