      <h1>Poppy and Titanic Sinclair Developing a Horror Film Together [Exclusive]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:59:39+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/mrdisgusting/" target="_blank">Brad Miska</a></address>
      <p>I’m fascinated with <b><i>Poppy</i></b>, an artist-turned-musician who cites Marilyn Manson and David Bowie of two of her main influences (the only person she follows on Twitter is Manson). Trying to define her is nearly impossible, but one thing is for certain, she’s transitioned into a metal-pop rockstar in what she calls “post genre”.</p>
      <p>She first dabbled in cross-pollinating the two genres on<i> I Am a Girl</i>, with the music video for “X” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbQsxWKfTSU">covering her in blood</a> <i>Carrie</i> style (above). Stating her pursuit of authenticity, she made the full transition with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izePLzAbc40">“Scary Mask” off her EP <i>Choke</i></a>. Next up is her expectation-subverting upcoming album <b><i>I Disagree</i></b> (out <b>January 10</b> via Sumerian), which has already seen the release of three ultra-heavy singles, including <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/music/3592858/poppy-fights-off-blood-money-latest-music-video/">“BLOODMONEY”</a>.</p>
      <p>Outside of her music, she’s touching all avenues of entertainment from creating her own graphic novel to scoring them with ambient music. Her videos for the aforementioned songs are <i>all</i> cinematic, showing that her star power could transcend music and take her directly into film.</p>
      <p>With that, Poppy appeared as a guest on this week’s <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/podcastnetwork/"><b>“The Boo Crew” </b>podcast</a> in which she shares <i>Texas Chain Saw Massacre</i> as her first horror experience, and shares her love for Ari Aster’s <i>Hereditary</i> and <i>Midsommar</i>, as well as Panos Cosmatos’ <i>Beyond The Black Rainbow</i>.</p>
      <p>She also reveals that she’s writing her own horror feature film.</p>
      <blockquote>“I’m working on a movie,” she tells the Boo. “Titanic [Sinclair] and I have been working on it for quite a while.”</blockquote>
      <p>When asked if it’s something that she’s writing and wanting to star in, she replied, “Yeah.”</p>
      <p><b>“It’s Poppy,”</b> she clarified when asked if she would star, implying it would follow her own character’s story.</p>
      <p>However, <b>more importantly, “It’s horror.”</b></p>
      <p>Listen…</p>
