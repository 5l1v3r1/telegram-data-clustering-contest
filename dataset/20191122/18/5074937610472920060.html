      <p>Kumasi, Nov. 22, GNA – The Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly (KMA) Court, a Circuit Court, has granted bail in the sum of GHȼ74,000.00 to a trader in Kumasi for allegedly defrauding a female Police officer of her GHȼ79,000.00.</p>
      <p>Doris Opoku, the accused, is said to have taken the money ostensibly to secure a 7- bedroom house at Amanfrom in Kumasi, for the woman, but this could not materialised.</p>
      <p>She pleaded guilty to the charge and would reappear before the Court presided over by Mrs. Mary Nsenkyere, on December 19, 2019.</p>
      <p>Prosecuting, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Felix Akowuah told the Court that, the complainant, Madam Lydia Wemegah, a Police Officer, is stationed at Bolgantanga, whiles the accused also resides at Asuofia-Asamang in Kumasi.</p>
      <p>He said on May 4, 2017 the accused sold the said house to the complainant at GHȼ95,000.00.</p>
      <p>The Prosecution said the accused issued the complainant with a ‘Term of Payment’ document indicating that the payment has to be completed in a two and half year duration, ending August 8, 2019.</p>
      <p>Mr Akowuah said the complainant was also issued with a Site plan and an Allocation documents all bearing the name of Kwabena Owusu, the accused person’s son.</p>
      <p>He said the complainant then made payments in installments to the total sum of GHȼ74,000.00 and receipts were issued accordingly.</p>
      <p>Prosecution said, during the month August 2019, complainant had information that the accused has sold the same property to one Bright Kwaku Owusu, who was carrying out renovation works on the same property.</p>
      <p>He said investigations revealed that, the accused after re-selling the property to Bright for GHȼ90,000.00, went ahead and took another payment of GHȼ5,000.00 from the complainant.</p>
      <p>The Prosecution said a complaint was made at the Suame Police Station and accused was arrested.</p>
      <p>ASP Felix Akowuah said in his cautioned statement the accused admitted the offence and was therefore charged and brought before the Court.</p>
