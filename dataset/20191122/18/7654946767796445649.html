      <h1>Ohio cop resigns after woman says he frisked her, asked crude questions during ride-along</h1>

      <p>A veteran police officer in Ohio has resigned after a college student complained about an unwanted frisk and crude questions about her sex life during a ride-along, police said.</p>
      <p>The sophomore at the University of Akron told a professor about the sordid allegations weeks after her trip with Akron Police Officer Joseph Horak in October, telling university police in a Title IX complaint that he used “inappropriate sexual language” and asked her unseemly personal questions, <a href="https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/investigations/akron-cop-resigns-after-sexually-charged-ride-along/95-bf3d7cfa-25fc-4930-b9d9-d2ddce89382b">WKYC reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The unwanted lewdness during the trip through Akron city limits continued until Horak pulled his police cruiser onto an access road, where he asked the woman, who had been interested in a law enforcement career, to step outside, she told the station.</p>
      <p>Despite saying she wasn’t interested, Horak “persisted with his request” and told the woman to “raise her hands” above her head. The officer of 12 years then ran his hand down her body from her “arm to her waist,” according to the woman’s account.</p>
      <p>The student reported the allegations to both university and Akron police three days after the ride-along, during which civilians typically spend a shift alongside emergency responders like police officers, firefighters or paramedics.</p>
      <p>Horak, who could not be reached for comment early Friday, resigned on Nov. 1, some two weeks after the alleged unwanted touching, a police spokesman confirmed to The Post.</p>
      <p>“The matter is under internal review within our department,” Akron Police Lt. Michael Miller said. “An investigation is ongoing.”</p>
      <p>Sondra Miller, president and CEO of the Cleveland Rape Crisis Center, told WKYC that unwanted sexual contact is more about “power and control” than actual physical contact, adding that offenders often prey upon people they think are vulnerable.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes college students fall within those categories,” Miller told the station. “They’re away from home for the first time. They don’t have the same support system they’ve had previously, and it does make them at pretty high risk of someone taking advantage of them.”</p>
