      <p>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is regarded as one of the best Resident Evil games ever made. While it garnered mixed reviews from critics, gamers absolutely loved it and have been asking Capcom for a remake since this generation of consoles launched. Now, according to numerous sources, it may be happening. Numerous YouTubers started confirming the remake yesterday, but now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-22-sources-resident-evil-3-remake-in-development">Eurogamer</a> is saying the same.</p>
      <p>The outlet said the following when discussing the rumor.</p>
      <blockquote>Capcom will follow its successful Resident Evil 2 remake with a new version of Resident Evil 3, a report today suggests. This comes from YouTuber SpawnWave, who said it was on track for a 2020 launch. Eurogamer has heard of the project also. Sources close to its development suggest it has been in development for some time - although the franchise's upcoming multiplayer portion Project Resistance is currently being given the spotlight.</blockquote>
      <p>We've reached out to Capcom for comment and shall update you as soon as we receive a response. Usually, game developers don't comment on rumors so don't expect the company to admit that it's in development. Capcom is probably saving the reveal for a big event like the PlayStation Conference or E3 2020. We'll keep you posted as soon as we know more.</p>
