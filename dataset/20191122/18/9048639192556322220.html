      <p><b>FRANKLIN PARISH, La. (KNOE) - </b>Authorities say they have arrested a student who brought a gun to school.</p>
      <p>According to the Franklin Parish Sheriff's Office, it happened Nov. 22 at Franklin Parish High School.</p>
      <p>They say Jarvis McCarthy was stopped as he entered the school around 8:30 a.m. They say this happened before McCarthy made any contact with students or faculty.</p>
      <p>While being questioned, it was revealed that McCarthy had a gun in his backpack. FPSO says they determined that McCarthy brought the gun to school because he was not planning to spend the night at home and he didn't want his parents to find the gun.</p>
      <p>McCarthy was booked into the Franklin Parish Detention Center on charges of carrying a firearm or dangerous weapon by a student or nonstudent on school property, at school-sponsored functions, or in a firearm-free zone and monetary instrument abuse (counterfeit bills).</p>
      <p>FPSO did not give details on the monetary instrument abuse charge.</p>
