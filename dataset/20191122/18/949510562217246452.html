      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Police say a throng of teenagers got out of hand at a New York City mall, and the commotion devolved into fights, injuries and an arrest as police and security officers cleared the crowd.</p>
      <p>The Queens Center mall mayhem began around 1:30 p.m. Friday. The local precinct captain noted many local schools had dismissed students early.</p>
      <p>Police say mall staffers asked them to intervene after the youths began running around and creating a ruckus.</p>
      <p>Police say that as the teens were ushered outside, skirmishes and fights broke out. One person was taken into custody, two were taken to a hospital and two others were injured but declined medical attention.</p>
      <p>A message was sent to a mall manager.</p>
      <p>WABC-TV says a mall spokesperson expressed disappointment in the teens’ actions.</p>
