      <h1>Glasgow health  board placed into 'special measures' after child deaths</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:17:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/auslan-cramb/" target="_blank">Auslan Cramb</a></address>
      <p>Scotland’s biggest health board has been placed into “special measures” following the deaths of two children in cancer wards at a scandal-hit hospital where the water was contaminated.</p>
      <p>An oversight board will be put in place by the Scottish Government to effectively run NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and the £840 Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH), which only opened in 2015.</p>
      <p>The move was announced on Friday by the under-fire Health Minister, Jeane Freeman, who earlier this week apologised to the parents of the two youngsters.</p>
      <p>They were being treated at the Royal Hospital for Children (RHC), which is part of the so-called “super-hospital” campus.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/20/snp-health-minister-admits-super-hospital-families-have-come/">Ms Freeman also revealed this week that she had received emails from four families</a> at the weekend over the problems, while a professor she has appointed to help resolve the issue "has had much more than that.”</p>
      <p>In a letter to Holyrood's health and sport committee, she said the board would be moved to stage four of a five-stage scale that is used to show the level of oversight for stricken health boards.</p>

      <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde now joins NHS Tayside, Highland and Borders at stage four.</p>
      <p>In her letter, Ms Freeman said: "The intention of the escalation would ensure appropriate governance is in place to increase public confidence and strengthen current approaches that are in place to mitigate avoidable harms.”</p>
      <p>Miles Briggs, the Tory health spokesman, said more than a third of mainland health boards were now at the second highest stage of escalation, adding: “What more proof could we need that this SNP government is utterly unfit to run the health service?”</p>
      <p>The move was announced as the mother of a three-year-old boy who died said her family had been treated unfairly and ignored.</p>
      <p>Mason Djemat, who was being treated for a rare genetic disease, died in August 2017 at the RHC, weeks before 10-year-old Milly Main, who was recovering from leukaemia treatment.</p>
      <p>Mason's mother, Victoria Freeman, said she was still seeking answers over the death of the son she "absolutely adored".</p>

      <p>She told BBC Scotland: "There was no-one listening to me. No-one wanted to help. No-one at all.”</p>
      <p>Ms Freeman said she first wrote to the health minister last September and was disappointed by the response.</p>
      <p>She added: "I don't think that Mason was acknowledged, particularly by her, and I feel that she did not take Mason's death seriously."</p>
      <p>She also said she got no response from the board until she went to the hospital and demanded to speak to somebody.</p>
      <p>Kimberly Darroch has already said she is 100 per cent certain that the death of her daughter Milly was linked to the water issue.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/19/snp-health-minister-urged-give-whistleblowers-scotlands-super/">A whistle-blower from the hospital</a> came forward earlier this month, telling the Labour MSP Anas Sarwar there had been 26 cases of infection, with Milly being among those hit. </p>
      <p>Mr Sarwar said the minister had taken the right course of action, adding: “The Glasgow health board is not fit for purpose and this is a necessary step following the unforgivable failings of senior management.</p>
      <p>“The focus now must be to tell parents, patients and the public the truth about infections at the hospital.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the health board said Mason’s case was fully investigated and the outcome shared with the family.</p>
      <p>The oversight board will be chaired by Prof Fiona McQueen, the chief nursing officer</p>
