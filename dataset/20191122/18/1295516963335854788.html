      <h1>Marvel's God of Thunder Wields Mjolnir in Artgerm's Thor #1 Variant</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:11:47+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:11</time> by <a rel="author">Berek Bigos</a></address>
      <p>With Jason Aaron wrapping up his final story arc for the Thunder God, Marvel is already preparing for Donny Cates and Nic Klein to helm Thor's next adventure. The publisher has now revealed Stanley "Artgerm" Lau's variant cover for <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/thor/">Thor</a><i> </i>#1 -- which arrives in comic shops New Year's Day.</p>
      <p>Since Aaron's grand finale has yet to reach its conclusion, Marvel has remained quite secretive regarding what fans can expect when Cates and Klein take over the series. That said, it comes as no surprise that Artgerm's variant doesn't include any spoilers or hint at an unknown plot element from Thor's upcoming relaunch. Rather, it is simply a stunning image of Thor with his trusty hammer Mjolnir in hand.</p>
