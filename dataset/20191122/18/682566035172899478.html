      <p>Manchester -<b> Pep Guardiola</b> has reluctantly accepted <b>Bernardo Silva's </b>one-match ban for a tweet comparing teammate <b>Benjamin Mendy</b> to a black cartoon character but the Manchester City manager again insisted that his player was not racist.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese will miss the match at home to Chelsea on Saturday after the FA found Silva guilty of an aggravated breach of rules because his tweet included a reference "whether expressed or implied, to race and/or colour and/or ethnic origin".</p>
      <p>Silva tweeted an image of a young Mendy alongside an image of the character representing the Spanish chocolate peanut brand Conguitos in September, deleting it shortly afterwards.</p>
      <p>The player said that it was meant as a joke between friends, but he has still been banned, fined 50,000 ($64,000) and must complete face-to-face education as part of his punishment.</p>
      <p>However Guardiola, who has stood by the 25-year-old, believes the FA are trying to make an example of Silva.</p>
      <p>"In this situation, the less important thing is the fact that we are going to miss him. He has been accused of something he's not," said the City boss.</p>
      <p>"If they want to pick on someone to show something, it was the right person. He will be careful with social media from now on, but if this can help make a better society, I'm pretty sure Bernardo will accept this punishment.</p>
      <p>"But he is not what he is accused of being."</p>
      <p>City take on Chelsea at the Etihad, with the London club one point and one place above them in the Premier League table after City's 3-1 defeat at Liverpool.</p>
      <p>The defending champions are now in fourth place, nine points off the pace set by Jurgen Klopp's team, while Lampard's Chelsea have overtaken them following six successive wins.</p>
      <p>The former England midfielder has hit the ground running at Chelsea and Guardiola believes the low expectations because of Lampard's inexperience as a manager allied to a transfer ban has allowed them to flourish.</p>
      <p>And it has echoes of when Guardiola took charge at Barcelona in 2008, after just one season in charge of the club's B team.</p>
      <p>"Frank knows Chelsea perfectly and how the club works behind the scenes, the relations with the fans, the media, the players," he said.</p>
      <p>"When I arrived at Barcelona, not many people trusted me, the president and sporting director, but not many."</p>
      <p>Guardiola said perhaps Lampard, widely regarded as one of Chelsea's greatest players, faced a similar situation.</p>
      <p>"When you start with nobody trusting you, it's perfect," he said. "You win games and more people trust you.</p>
      <p>"When you have won titles, you always have to defend what you've won in your career and it's never enough."</p>
      <p>One piece of good news for Guardiola is that after missing the defeat at Liverpool, goalkeeper Ederson will be back, from the muscle injury he picked up in the 1-1 draw at Atalanta in the Champions League earlier this month.</p>
