      <h1>Anonymous Patriots Player Calls Out Tom Brady’s Attitude After Win Over Eagles: ‘Felt Like We Lost’ (VIDEO)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:23:14+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:23</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Last Sunday, the New England Patriots faced off against the Philadelphia Eagles for the time since the Patriots lost in a thriller at Super Bowl LII.</p>
      <p>Brady likely wanted to shove the ball down their throats for some payback, but the offense never could get going to put a bunch of points on the board, but they still came out victorious by a score of 17-10.</p>
      <p>Brady was 26 of 47 for 216 yards, but threw for no touchdowns and he was clearly not happy about the offense after the game.</p>

      <p>ESPN’s Patriots insider Mike Reiss revealed on Get Up Friday morning that Brady’s attitude was so bad about the game that it had at least one member of the team felt extremely discouraged.</p>

      <blockquote>“One player described it to me this way: he said, ‘Even though we won the game, it felt like we lost.’</blockquote>
      <p>Watching Tom Brady and hearing his tone after that win over the Eagles, it’s was a reminder that his leadership, the way he speaks, the way he acts, permeates throughout that locker room.</p>
      <p>But one thing we’ve noticed over the past couple days, is a shift. Tom Brady moved up his news conference two days and his tone was a lot softer. Being in the room and listening to his talk, it was almost like there was acceptance from him that this is the present reality, he has to rely on some of his younger players and maybe taking on a more encouraging tone would help get the best out of them.”</p>
      <p>Hopefully, the offense gets back on tract as the team has to face off against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.</p>
