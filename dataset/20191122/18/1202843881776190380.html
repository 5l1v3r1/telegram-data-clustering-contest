      <p>Dakhla, Western Sahara:  In the Oued Eddahab desert in Western Sahara, Habiboullah Dlimi raises dairy and racing camels just like his ancestors used to -- but with a little help from modern technology.</p>
      <p>His animals roam free in the desert and are milked as camels always have been, by hand, at dawn and dusk.</p>
      <p>When camels "feed on wild plants and walk all day, the milk is much better," said the 59-year-old herder, rhapsodising about the benefits of the nutrient-rich drink, known as the "source of life" for nomads.</p>
      <p>But Dlimi no longer lives with his flock.</p>
      <p>He lives in town with his family. His camels are watched over by hired herders and Dlimi follows GPS coordinates across the desert in a 4X4 vehicle to reach them.</p>
      <p>He is reticent when asked about the size of his herd. "That would bring bad luck," he said.</p>
      <p>He prefers to speak of the gentleness and friendliness of the animals he knows like his own children.</p>
      <p>"Camels can endure everything: sun, wind, sand and lack of water, and if they could talk, you'd easily hear how intelligent they are," he said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Tribes are tribes'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dlimi comes from a long line of desert dwellers from the Ouled Dlimi tribe.</p>
      <p>As tradition dictates, he lists his ancestors going back five generations when introducing himself.</p>
      <p>"I know the desert and the desert knows me," he said.</p>
      <p>Like elsewhere, the nomads of Western Sahara are settling, following a shift from rural to urban living.</p>
      <p>"Young people prefer to stay in town," Dlimi said, and herders now mostly come from neighbouring Mauritania, whose desert north is traversed by caravans of up to a thousand camels.</p>
      <p>Even they "often demand to work in areas covered by (mobile phone) network signal," he added.</p>
      <p>The population of the nearby town of Dakhla has tripled to 100,000 in 20 years, with growth driven by fishing, tourism and greenhouse farming encouraged by Morocco.</p>
      <p>In this part of Western Sahara, development projects depend entirely on Rabat.</p>
      <p>Morocco has controlled 80 percent of the former Spanish colony since the 1970s and wants to maintain it as an autonomous territory under its sovereignty.</p>
      <p>The Polisario Front movement fought a war for independence from 1975 to 1991 and wants a referendum in which the people of Western Sahara choose between independence and integration with Morocco.</p>
      <p>The United Nations has been trying to negotiate a political compromise for decades.</p>
      <p>Like many in his tribe, Dlimi has family members on the other side of the Western Sahara Wall separating the Moroccan controlled areas from the Polisario controlled areas.</p>
      <p>He favours loyalty to Morocco while others back independence, he said.</p>
      <p>Tribal affiliation trumps politics, though.</p>
      <p>"Tribes are tribes, it's a social organisation," he said. "There are very strong links between us."</p>
      <p>To "preserve the past for the future," Dlimi started a cultural association to conserve traditions from a time when there were no borders and "families followed the herds and the clouds".</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Eight-time champion'</b>
      </p>
      <p>While Dlimi loves the desert, he does have one complaint: "The camel dairy industry is valued everywhere in the world except here."</p>
      <p>Camel milk is trendy with health-conscious consumers and the lean meat is excellent, Dlimi claims.</p>
      <p>Today though, it is small livestock farming that is the main agricultural focus, in response to what non-nomadic Moroccans tend to eat.</p>
      <p>The 266,000 square kilometres (106,400 square miles) of Western Sahara under Moroccan control hosts some 6,000 herders, 105,000 camels, and 560,000 sheep and goats, according to figures from Rabat.</p>
      <p>In other arid countries, including Saudi Arabia, intensive farming of camels has taken off.</p>
      <p>But, while Moroccan authorities have undertaken several studies into developing Western Sahara's camel industry, these have not so far been acted upon.</p>
      <p>Regardless, a local adage holds that he who has no camel, has nothing.</p>
      <p>"Some say that Saharans are crazy because when they have money they spend it on four feet," Dlimi jokes.</p>
      <p>For him, 20,000 dirhams ($2,000) spent on a camel is a safe investment.</p>
      <p>But it is also a consuming passion.</p>
      <p>His Facebook page and WhatsApp messages are filled with talk of camel husbandry techniques, research and racing.</p>
      <p>Racing "is a pleasure and it pays", Dlimi said.</p>
      <p>Since the United Arab Emirates funded construction of a camel racing track at Tantan, 900 kilometres (560 miles) to the north, racing animals have appreciated in value and can sell for up to 120,000 dirhams, according to Dlimi.</p>
      <p>To train his racing camels, Dlimi chases the young animals across the desert in his 4X4.</p>
      <p>The technique has made him an eight-time champion in national competitions, he said.</p>
      <p>But camels can be stubborn, Dlimi stressed, telling of how he once sold his best champion for a "very good price", but the animal refused to race once it had changed hands.</p>
