      <h1>Senate Democrats ask Pompeo to recuse himself from Ukraine matters</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:19:47+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rachel-frazin" target="_blank">Rachel Frazin</a></address>
      <p>Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are calling on Secretary of State <a href="https://thehill.com/people/mike-pompeo">Mike Pompeo</a> to recuse himself from matters relating to Ukraine after several witnesses in the impeachment inquiry mentioned him as part of their testimony.</p>
      <p>"Given your direct involvement in the scandal, you have a profound conflict of interest and you must recuse yourself," the group of 10 senators <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/11-21-19%20SFRC%20Dems%20letter%20requesting%20Pompeo%20recusal.pdf">wrote</a> in a letter to Pompeo as House Democrats on Thursday wrapped up two weeks of public testimony from various figures.</p>
      <p>Their letter follows testimony from <a href="https://thehill.com/people/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a>, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, in which Sondland said that Pompeo was among a group of officials who were "in the loop" about efforts to pressure Ukraine to say it would pursue investigations that <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> wanted in exchange for a White House call and meeting.</p>
      <p>Pompeo has also said he was on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukraine's president that is at the heart of the impeachment probe. </p>
      <p>The Democrats in their letter accused the Trump Cabinet member of continuing "to impede the House impeachment inquiry, including by refusing to produce any State Department records on the Trump-Ukraine scandal—including those that may shed further light on your own complicity."</p>
      <p>"These acts leave us with little doubt that you are blocking the Congress and American people from obtaining a full account of the scandal solely because the facts are damaging to your and the President’s personal and political interests," they added. </p>
      <p>The Hill has reached out to the State Department for comment on the letter. </p>
      <p>Pompeo said said Wednesday that he had not seen Sondland's testimony, <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/471314-pompeo-on-sondland-testimony-i-didnt-see-a-single-thing-today-i-was">citing</a> meetings, after being asked by a reporter about the testimony.</p>
      <p>The Thursday letter was signed by Democratic Sens. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/robert-menendez">Bob Menendez</a> (N.J.), <a href="https://thehill.com/people/benjamin-cardin">Ben Cardin</a> (Md.), <a href="https://thehill.com/people/jeanne-shaheen">Jeanne Shaheen</a> (N.H.), <a href="https://thehill.com/people/christopher-coons">Christopher Coons</a> (Del.), <a href="https://thehill.com/people/tom-udall">Tom Udall</a> (N.M.), <a href="https://thehill.com/people/christopher-murphy">Chris Murphy</a> (Conn.), <a href="https://thehill.com/people/tim-kaine">Tim Kaine</a> (Va.), <a href="https://thehill.com/people/ed-markey">Ed Markey</a> (Mass.), <a href="https://thehill.com/people/jeff-merkley">Jeff Merkley</a> (Ore.) and <a href="https://thehill.com/people/cory-booker">Cory Booker</a> (N.J.).</p>
