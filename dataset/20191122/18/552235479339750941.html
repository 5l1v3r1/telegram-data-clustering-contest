      <h1>Stewart Milne to step down as Aberdeen chairman with Dave Cormack to take over</h1>
      <h2>The 69-year-old has decided to concentrate on his other businesses and will be replaced by Dave Cormack.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:06:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:06</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Burns, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-burns/</a></address>
      <p>Building tycoon <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stewart-milne">Stewart Milne</a> is leaving his role as chairman of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> after 21 years at the helm.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dave-cormack">Dave Cormack</a> will replace him as the head of the club in a move that could see the Dons' board totally reconfigured.</p>
      <p>It's expected that the news will be announced and voted on at the club's December AGM.</p>
      <p>Milne has decided that over two decades service at one of the country's biggest football clubs is enough and will now look to recede into the background.</p>
      <p>The 69-year-old is still busy with his other business and wants to concentrate more on them after helping the Dons to deliver their new Cormack Park training ground, that was opened last month.</p>
      <p>Milne has ploughed millions into the club and has helped turn them into one of Scotland’s top clubs once again under <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/derek-mcinnes">Derek McInnes'</a> stewardship.</p>

      <p>The current chairman has had his ups and downs in charge and despite his massive financial outlay he has seen the club pick up just one trophy – the 2014 <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/league-cup">League Cup.</a></p>
      <p>Former chief executive Cormack is set to pick up the baton.</p>
      <p>The software millionaire has also invested heavily into the club and also brought in US investment to help fund Cormack Park.</p>
      <p>Cormack has also opened up links with Atlanta United and has made it clear of his ambitions to turn Aberdeen into one of Europe’s top 100 clubs.</p>
      <p>Major finance is also needed to raise the money for the proposed new stadium at Kingsford.</p>
      <p>It is likely that Cormack will need to help find the funds although a possible revamp of Pittodrie is also now being muted.</p>
      <p>Life-long Dons Cormack is keen to shake up Pittodrie and looks set to make big changes once he takes power.</p>
