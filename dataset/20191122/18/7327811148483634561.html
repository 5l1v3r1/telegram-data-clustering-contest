      <p>ST. ALBANS, Queens (WABC) -- Three men are dead after fire tore through a vacant home overnight in Queens.</p>
      <p>Firefighters arrived just before midnight Thursday to find flames shooting from a home at Farmers Boulevard and Jordan Avenue in St. Albans.</p>
      <p>The blaze was consuming the structure from the cellar all the way up to through the first and second floors.</p>
      <p>As firefighters worked to control the fire from inside the building, they found three men -- two on the first floor and one on the second.</p>
      <p>All were unresponsive, and EMTs later pronounced them dead.</p>

      <p>One of the firefighters fell through a hole in the floor to the basement, and four firefighters were treated for minor injuries in total.</p>
      <p>Fire officials said crews were not expecting to find anyone inside because the home was vacant and had a marking outside indicating that was the case.</p>
      <p>"It indeed is a vacant building, and (we) confirm that ConEd hasn't supplied power to the building in approximately two years," FDNY Assistant Chief Joseph Jardin said. "That house was boarded up for a while, so I can only assume that they were living there as squatters."</p>
      <p>Eyewitness News is told the victims were each between the ages of 35 and 40.</p>
      <p>The medical examiner is working to identify them.</p>
      <p>Fire investigators remained on the scene trying to determine what sparked the blaze.</p>
