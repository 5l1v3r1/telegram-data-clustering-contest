      <p>Balancing games isn’t easy, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/10/28/20936637/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-review-playstation-pc-xbox-dark"><i>Call of Duty</i><i>: Modern Warfare</i></a><i> </i>has already had a slew of issues to work out. While the 725 shotgun, which was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/4/20947809/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-recoil-kilo-141-m13-mp5-725">basically a sniper rifle when the game first released</a>, has been the game’s most high-profile balance issue, the sound of footsteps have had almost as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/8/20955034/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-shotgun-nerf-claymore-hardpoint-patch">many changes</a> over the last few weeks.</p>
      <p>Players have been complaining about the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/12/20961861/modern-warfare-nov-12-patch-725-shotgun-nerf-footsteps">fact that footsteps were too loud</a> since the game’s release. While this may not sound like a big deal, it’s actually pretty damned important.</p>
      <p>Footsteps are an important part of spatial awareness in Call of Duty games. If someone’s sneaking up on you, their footsteps might be the only thing that warns you. But if they’re too loud, they could drown out other important noises and completely ruin the chance for <i>any</i> stealth in the game.</p>
      <p>Infinity Ward has been trying to get the footstep noises just right over the last several patches, but fans still aren’t quite happy. The latest patch, which Infinity Ward released on Friday morning, adjusts the volume and sound type for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/dzy5uc/112219_patch_notes/">crouch walking and walking while aiming down sights</a>.</p>

      <p>But it doesn’t seem like the patch will completely fix the problem. According to Call of Duty site, <a href="https://charlieintel.com/update-1-09-for-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-now-live-patch-notes/58055/">Charlie Intel the Battle.Net version of the patch notes briefly had a section with an internal note</a>.</p>
      <p>The note reads, “This is a hot topic in the community, and this is not the change that they were hoping to see. Our core players want to see footstep volume dramatically reduced.”</p>
      <p>Infinity Ward has since removed the note, but it leaves a lot of questions for players. It’s clear that Infinity Ward has heard the complaints, and is intending to fix footsteps in one way or another. But whether or not the developer ever plans to fix footstep volume in the way that some players <i>want</i> remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>For a look at all the changes coming to <i>Modern Warfare</i> in the game’s latest patch you can see the full notes below.</p>
