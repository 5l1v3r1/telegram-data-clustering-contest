      <p>Beck would like you to know he is no longer a Scientologist.</p>
      <p>The singer confirmed 15 years ago that he was part of the religion that also calls Tom Cruise a member.</p>
      <p>He has now turned away from the Church of Scientology after his divorce last February from second-generation Scientologist Marissa Ribisi.</p>
      <p>The “Everybody’s Got To Learn Sometime” singer was once an active campaigner for the church, but has since changed his mind.</p>

      <p>“I think there’s a misconception that I am a Scientologist. I’m not a Scientologist. I don’t have any connection or affiliation with it,” Beck told <i>The Sydney Morning Herald </i>according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/beck-says-he-is-not-a-scientologist-1257357"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“But I’ve pretty much just focused on my music and my work for most of my life, and tended to do my own thing,” he continued. “I think it’s just something people ran with.”</p>
      <p>Although that contradicts an interview in 2005 with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100915054237/http://www.tribune.ie/article/2005/jun/12/a-sort-of-homecoming/"><i>Irish Sunday Tribune</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, I’m a Scientologist. My father has been a Scientologist for about 35 years, so I grew up in and around it and stuff,” Beck had said.</p>

      <p>“People can sort of say and do whatever they want,” he continued. “All I can do is live my life with integrity and raise my child and work hard and work hard for the people I work with. I don’t have anything to hide. I am completely proud of my life.”</p>
      <p>Beck and Marissa were married in 2004. Marissa is the twin sister of Giovanni Ribisi and they are both well-known Scientologists taking part in many events and fundraising initiatives.</p>
