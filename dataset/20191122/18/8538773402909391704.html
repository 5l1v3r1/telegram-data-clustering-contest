      <p>Ronaldo was not on the squad list Juventus released for the Atalanta clash Friday, and the Portuguese forward, who said he has been hampered by a lingering knee injury for the past three weeks, confirmed he'd be undertaking a period of recovery in <a href="https://twitter.com/Cristiano/status/1197925683722432515">a message posted on his social media accounts</a>.</p>

      <p>"Focused on my recovery to come back soon!" Ronaldo said.</p>
      <p>Last week, the 34-year-old joined Portugal for two Euro 2020 qualifiers amid speculation over his fitness and attitude following his angry reaction to being substituted during Juventus' 1-0 win over AC Milan the previous Sunday.</p>
      <p>Maurizio Sarri at the time said that Ronaldo had been struggling with a knee problem for a while, and <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/portugal-por/story/3992487/cristiano-ronaldo-blasts-potato-field-pitchsays-not-fully-fit">Ronaldo confirmed the injury</a> when speaking to reporters the following Sunday.</p>
      <p>"In the last three weeks, I have been playing with limitations," Ronaldo said. "But there was no controversy -- you [the media] created that.</p>

      <p>"I tried to help Juventus. Nobody likes to be substituted, but I understood because I wasn't in such good shape," he added.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo said he was also "not 100%" in the two Portugal matches.</p>
      <p>"I sacrificed myself for the team," he said. "We could have missed out [on Euro 2020]. Thankfully, I haven't been injured much in my career, but it can happen.</p>
      <p>"It's a pain that prevents me from being 100%, but I always try to play. They created a big controversy where it didn't need to exist. I'll be back to 100% soon."</p>
