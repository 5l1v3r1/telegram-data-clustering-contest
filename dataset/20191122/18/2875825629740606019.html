      <p>Anthony Joshua has named Andy Ruiz Jr as his "arch nemesis" - and added insult to injury with an unflattering drawing of his rival.</p>
      <p>Joshua took some time out of his gruelling training camp to take part in an 'Attack Art' challenge with sponsors <a href="https://blog.jdsports.co.uk/anthony-joshua-shows-jd-a-different-kind-of-pad-work">JD Sports</a> and their presenter Specs Gonzelez.</p>
      <p>He was asked to draw a photo of his arch nemesis in round two of the challenge and responded with a drawing of Ruiz.</p>
      <p>Whilst Joshua's artistic skills clearly need some work, he unveiled a drawing of Ruiz which showed a rather bulging mid-section.</p>

      <p>Ruiz Jr came under fire for his unathletic physique before the first fight, only to silence his critics with a stunning display to hand Joshua his first defeat as a professional.</p>
      <p>Explaining his drawing, Joshua said: “This is a guy called Ruiz, who I’m fighting soon – before this year is out – and my journey to becoming two-time heavyweight champion.</p>
      <p>“The only reason why this guy is the arch-nemesis is because there is no other focus.”</p>

      <p>Footage has shown the venue for Joshua's rematch with Ruiz Jr almost complete.</p>
      <p>The duo will clash on the Dunes in Saudi Arabia with Joshua insisting he isn't about to "become a p**** overnight" as he vowed to reclaim his belts.</p>
      <p>“We haven’t done anything differently mentally, I’m a champion,” he said defiantly. “I walked into the gym and three years later I was Olympic champion.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had one loss, but I’m not about to become a p***** overnight and not be able to fight.</p>
      <p>“I can fight, that’s it. I don’t need to reflect on that, I just need to win.”</p>
