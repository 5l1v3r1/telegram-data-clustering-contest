      <h2>Smith defends his super-middleweight title against John Ryder tonight but has his eyes on much bigger fights next year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T18:21:59+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 18:21</time> by <a rel="author">Barry McGuigan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/barry-mcguigan/</a></address>
      <p>In the history of a brilliant division for boxers from these isles it is hard to know where WBA super-middleweight champion Callum Smith stands. </p>
      <p>He just needs more of the super fights to be considered in the same breath as Carl Froch, Joe Calzaghe, Nigel Benn, Chris Eubank, Steve Collins and George Groves.</p>
      <p>His date with John Ryder at the Echo Arena in Liverpool this weekend does not quite fill that brief though there is enough interest in it to keep him honest. </p>
      <p>Ryder is a tough kid, a southpaw with a heavy punch. But at 5ft 9ins he has problems against taller guys.</p>
      <p>I watched him coming through in the amateurs. He stood out back then and won an ABA senior novice title in the same year as my son, Shane. But when you step up to elite level it gets much tougher.</p>

      <p>Mirror Fighting has launched a new weekly boxing show in association with Betfair in which we analyse the latest big fights, play matchmaker, and preview forthcoming bouts.</p>
      <p>Former super-middleweight world champion George Groves provides expert analysis.</p>
      <p>To watch the latest show in full, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdmmigRSAo&amp;feature=youtu.be">click here</a>.</p>
      <p>Ryder leans back with a low centre of gravity which means Smith has to punch down, making him vulnerable to counters.</p>
      <p>Though it will be fascinating to see how Smith deals with that he has the tools to beat anybody, as he showed in ending the career of Groves. </p>
      <p>At 6ft 3 ins he is a big lump at 168lb and for me the No.1 super middleweight in the world ahead of Billy Joe Saunders, David Benavidez and Caleb Plant.</p>
      <p>Smith is equally proficient in the trenches as he is at distance, and a world class puncher. That left hook either to the body or the head is devastating.  </p>
      <p>He is looking for big fights now. He wants Saul Alvarez, which would be a great fight fot him and a chance to avenge his brother Liam’s defeat to Canelo three years ago.</p>

      <p>He is talking of going up if he can’t land a big fish. I would counsel against that for now. The light-heavyweight division is red hot and he would not carry the same size advantage. </p>
      <p>Also on the Liverpool bill is my cruiserweight Chris Billam-Smith, who is looking to bounce back after a razor thin first defeat to Richard Riakporhe. </p>
      <p>He is up against Craig Glover for the vacant Commonwealth title and knows how important this fight is.</p>
      <p>He has improved in every department since July and has been massively inspired by Josh Taylor’s epic victory over Regis Prograis and Luke Campbell’s brave display against Vasyl Lomachenko.  </p>
      <p>The defeat to Riakporhe was by split-decision but a loss nevertheless. You don’t want to  make a habit of coming second in this game.</p>
