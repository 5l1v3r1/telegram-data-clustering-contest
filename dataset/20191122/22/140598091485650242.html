      <p>Jose Mourinho has said he needs to bring “the real Dele Alli” back to Tottenham Hotspur and added that it is up to the rest of the team to improve and give Harry Kane the success he deserves to persuade him to stay at the club.</p>
      <p>As Mourinho <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/22/jose-mourinho-needs-prove-spurs-makes-dangerous/">prepares for his latest return to the Premier League</a>, with a lunchtime trip to West Ham on Saturday, he continued his charm offensive at his new club, saying it was a relief to now work with chairman Daniel Levy having previously been at clubs who were “in fear” of him and reiterated that he did not need new signings and would not be an “Einstein” reinventing the way Spurs played. “You are not going to see <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/20/tough-act-follow-tottenhams-split-mauricio-pochettino-had-coming/">Harry Kane </a>playing left-back, that’s for sure,” Mourinho said.</p>
      <p>That reference to Einstein was a nod to a comment Mourinho made three years ago, as Manchester United manager, when he attacked the “football Einsteins” who he felt were trying to undermine his achievements.</p>
      <p>But having recently spent time as a television pundit himself, with Sky Sports, Mourinho said he had a different perspective - even if he accepted the likes of Graeme Souness and Roy Keane would still “kill me” if he makes mistakes.</p>
      <p>There has certainly been criticism of Alli this season, with the 23-year-old struggling badly for form.</p>
      <p>“I have already spoken with him (Alli) and I asked him if he was Dele or Dele’s brother,” Mourinho said. “He told me he was Dele. ‘Okay,’ I said. ‘Play like Dele’. I think he is potentially a fantastic player. Now I have to create a tactical situation he is happy with, give him the right dynamics and prepare him physically well because he has had important injuries and he is not on the top of his form.</p>
      <p>“I cannot expect him to play on Saturday – if he plays – and go there and be man of the match. But he needs to go through a process that will bring the real Dele back because the real Dele is the one who in the last few years has impressed us all.”</p>
      <p>Alli would appear to be a player Mourinho can work with – there are shades of Frank Lampard in him – as is Kane, who is understood to be unsettled by Spurs’ continued failure to win a trophy and the possibility of missing out on next season’s Champions League.</p>
      <p>Mourinho said managers have been “wasting” their time trying to signing Kane in the past. “We must have also this feeling of what is possible, what is not possible - and I think when you try to buy Kane it’s just an impossible mission,” he said.</p>
      <p>“He’s one of the best strikers in the world, no doubt. He just needs his team to bring him, or to go with him to the next level. And what is the next level? Titles. I think he needs to win, with us, with England, he needs to bring something to highlight the quality that he has as a player. The goals he scores, what he brings to the team.</p>
      <p>“He is a top striker. And I’ve worked with some of the top ones.”</p>
      <p>The question is: will it remain an “impossible mission” if it is felt the huge money that could be gained from selling Kane could bring in funds for a re-build, despite Mourinho’s protestations that one is not needed?</p>

      <p>Mourinho wants to keep Kane and, understandably, turned questions on the 26-year-old’s future to Levy. “This is not about me. This is about Mr Levy, this is about the club,” Mourinho said. “He has a vision, and part of that vision is to make the club better, bigger. There is no better and bigger football club without a bigger and better football team. So keeping the best players is obviously part of that plan. “It was not like a promise to me, it was not like I said: ‘I only go if, I only go if’. There were no ‘ifs’. It was him [Levy], part of his explanation about his vision for the club. Without being specific about the players, he told me he does not sell players when the manager doesn’t want to sell.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho said that he knows, from previous experience, how difficult it can be to negotiate with Levy and buy players from Spurs. “I used to be in clubs that fear him. It’s true. He’s powerful. He’s a businessman, but he’s a football man. He has big experience, a part of his intelligence overall, he’s a football man, he understands football, he understands the industry, he understands the evolution, he’s very clever. It’s great to have him on my side.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho stressed he did not expect to spend money, despite his reputation for needing to do so. “Maybe it’s my fault. Maybe it’s also the profile of club that I normally get. It’s like you people say, I always need money to spend with players. It’s not me, it’s my clubs. It’s the profile of the club, it’s the profile of the owner, the profile of, let’s say, Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t spend money at Porto. I didn’t spend money at Inter. You know I like the place [Spurs]. I like the players. I don’t need to spend a huge amount of money.”</p>
