      <h1>Alibaba partnership connects Aussie businesses to $1.3 trillion market</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:30:03+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/eblack/" target="_blank">Euan Black</a></address>
      <p>A new industry partnership with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has opened up a $1.3 trillion market for Australian businesses. </p>
      <p>The Australian Retailers Association (ARA) announced on Thursday that a new partnership with Alibaba – often described as the Chinese equivalent of Amazon – would make it easier for Australian retailers to access millions of Chinese customers.</p>
      <p>Shoppers spent <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p190515.pdf">US$853 billion (AU$1.3 trillion) on Alibaba’s online marketplace</a> in the 12 months to March 31, 2019.</p>
      <p>And given <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/money/finance-news/2019/11/04/september-retail-surplus/">domestic consumption is weak</a>, that massive consumer spend will encourage plenty of Australian businesses to make use of the strengthened ties, according to Queensland University of Technology associate professor Gary Mortimer.</p>
      <p>Professor Mortimer told <i>The New Daily </i>that working with Alibaba was a “smart way” to break into a market that’s otherwise difficult to crack.</p>
      <p>And he said the announcement was particularly good news for companies selling vitamins, baby milk formula, and “any form of Australian-produced skincare products”.</p>
      <p>“Those types of products do exceptionally well,” Professor Mortimer said, referring to Swisse, A2 and Blackmores.</p>
      <blockquote>The benefit Australia has is exceptionally high food processing quality controls – and that’s why those types of products are so attractive to the Chinese market.”</blockquote>
      <p>Chinese consumers are less worried about accidentally buying counterfeit products when they shop Australian brands, Professor Mortimer said.</p>
      <p>And some treat them as status symbols, too.</p>
      <p>“We know we’ve got a growing Chinese middle class which is looking for aspirational products,” Professor Mortimer said.</p>
      <p>“And to have an Australian branded product in your kitchen or your bathroom tends to, I guess, highlight to your friends and family and neighbours that you’re obviously quite successful.”</p>
      <p>ARA’s announcement comes just weeks after the world was offered a fresh glimpse into the size of China’s consumer market – a sight that would have left Aussie retailers drooling with envy.</p>
      <p>Known as <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/money/finance-news/2018/11/12/alibaba-singles-day-records/">Singles’ Day</a>, November 11 is a massive 24-hour shopping event in China.</p>
      <p>It started out as an anti-Valentines’ protest, but was co-opted by Alibaba in 2009 and converted into a bigger version of America’s annual Black Monday sale.</p>
      <p>And, this year, shoppers spent US$38.4 billion (AU$56.6 billion) in just 24 hours.</p>

      <p>Australia was the fourth largest exporter of products to China on the day – after Japan, the United States and South Korea – and the platform already sells products from more than 2000 Australian brands.</p>
      <p>But Professor Mortimer said Australia’s retail sector – which just experienced its worst year since the 1990-91 recession – would naturally want a bigger share of the pie.</p>
      <p>“You may be producing or manufacturing in Australia and selling domestically, but having an alternative revenue channel may, in fact, be a smart move,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It may prop up Aussie businesses that are struggling to gain traction in the domestic market … and I think Australian businesses should leverage that opportunity while they can.”</p>
      <p>Professor Mortimer added, however, that businesses could see their products counterfeited by local producers if they export to China – something which could tarnish their brand’s reputation.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, ARA executive chairman Russell Zimmerman told <i>The New Daily</i> the association would be running a series of events over the next 12 months to help Australian retailers sell their products on Alibaba’s online platform.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/money/finance-news/2019/11/04/september-retail-surplus/">
            <b>Disappointing retail figures cast doubt over economic policy</b>
          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>And he said Alibaba would help Australian businesses boost their sales among domestic Chinese tourists, by connecting them to its payments service AliPay.</p>
      <p>“The Asian consumer has a big appetite for product out of Australia,” Mr Zimmerman said.</p>
      <p>“They know it’s well made … it’s good value for money in many cases, it’s gone through quality controls, and they know it’s genuine.”</p>
