      <h1>Nuno: Diogo Jota getting back to his best for Wolves</h1>
      <h2>Nuno Espirito Santo is confident Wolves attacker Diogo Jota is getting back to his best after fully shaking off a foot injury.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:29:55+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joe-edwards/" target="_blank">Joe Edwards</a></address>
      <p>Jota has started the last four Premier League games following a month-long lay-off and has not found the net.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old, though, has had his spirits boosted by making his full Portugal debut during the international break – and Nuno expects him to return to the peak of his powers soon.</p>
      <p>“I think so. He had the injury, so he had to stop for a little while,” said Nuno.</p>
      <p>“But he’s better now and we’ve been trying to increase his participation during the games.</p>
      <p>“Now, I can say he is totally ready to compete at the best level.”</p>
      <p>Jota made his Portugal bow as they thrashed Lithuania, coming off the bench.</p>
      <p>He was then introduced as a substitute as they won in Luxembourg to seal qualification for the Euros – the tournament they won in 2016.</p>
      <p>“When you work in your club and have the chance to go to your national team, and you participate and you help your country, it’s a moment of enormous pride,” said Nuno.</p>
      <p>“Diogo had his chance and helped Portugal achieve something amazing – direct qualification for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>“He’s very proud of what he’s achieving. But at the same time, he has the ambition to continue to improve.</p>
      <p>“Going to the national team is a reflection of how you work here at the club.</p>
      <p>“It’s good for players, their motivation and confidence. It’s a reflection of their daily work.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully, he will participate more for the national team.”</p>
      <p>Jota would have got on the scoresheet in Luxembourg had it not been for Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
      <p>Jota’s close-range volley was heading over the line.</p>
      <p>However, Ronaldo intervened and poked the ball in himself to deny the Wolves man his first Portugal strike, and claim his 99th for his country.</p>
      <p>On the goal, Nuno said: “Diogo was there.</p>
      <p>“He has to be happy because he was there.</p>
      <p>“When you’re on the pitch, it doesn’t matter who puts the ball in the net.</p>
      <p>“It’s the team that achieves a goal, not an individual.”</p>
      <p>Now, Jota’s focus is on helping Wolves, who are aiming to make it eight unbeaten in the league at Bournemouth tomorrow.</p>
      <p>The game is one of 10 for Nuno’s charges before the new year.</p>
      <p>They have already played 24 times in all competitions, though, and the boss is not treating this period with extra vigilance.</p>
      <p>After all, they always make sure they are prepared in the best way possible.</p>
      <p>“Our vigilance doesn’t increase or decrease. It’s always the same,” added Nuno.</p>
      <p>“It’s always the highest we can have as every moment of the day is crucial – a training session, a game.</p>
      <p>“Every moment is crucial, so you can never relax. You always have to be switched on.”</p>
