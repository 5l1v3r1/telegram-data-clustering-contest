      <p>The Lagos State House of Assembly on Friday announced the suspension of the Chairman of Ifako/Ijaiye Local Government, Oloruntoba Oke, and three others over alleged misappropriation of N350 million.</p>
      <p>The suspension was sequel a report submitted to the Assembly at plenary by Rotimi Olowo, the Chairman of an ad-hoc committee constituted to investigate the alleged misappropriation of funds in the council.</p>
      <p>Olowo noted that the fund was approved in 2012 for the funding of five projects in the local government.</p>
      <p>The lawmaker named others affected as the Council Manager, Treasurer and Engineer.</p>
      <p>Contributing, Abiodun Tobun (Epe I) lamented that some council officials were working against the law, urging them to embark on projects that would improve the lives of the people.</p>
      <p>Tobun, while supporting the suspension of the council chairman, said it would serve as deterrent to others who had it in mind to misappropriate funds allocated for project execution.</p>
      <p>In his remark, Bisi Yusuff (Alimosho I) pointed out that the secretariat for which the loan was collected, amongst others, was still in a bad state.</p>
      <p>Yusuff condemned what he called the inability of the Ministry of Local Government and Local Government Service Commission to monitor projects at the council.</p>
      <p>He noted that it was their negligence that contributed to the misappropriation of funds in the council.</p>
      <p>Also, Sanai Agunbiade, the Majority Leader, commended the six councillors in the council who petitioned the Assembly on the alleged misappropriation of funds for their courage.</p>
      <p>Speaking, the Speaker of the Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, said the chairman could not be suspended in isolation as other officials were also indicted in the report.</p>
      <p>Mudashiru said the council’s Vice Chairman, Akanbi Hamzat, should take over its affairs.</p>
