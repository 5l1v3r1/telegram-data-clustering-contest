      <h2>Aston Villa v Newcastle United | Dean Smith talks about the rumoured interest in super John McGinn after the 25-year-old's goal-scoring exploits for Scotland during the break</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Preece, https://www.facebook.com/PreeceBirminghamLive/</a></address>
      <p>Dean Smith believes <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> can - and will - keep hold of Scottish goal-scoring sensation John McGinn, beaming: "I have no doubt in my mind."</p>
      <p>McGinn has long been touted with a potential move to Manchester United, with Newcastle United boss Steve Bruce - the man who brought him to Villa Park last summer - admitting this week he's Old Trafford-quality.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old, signed for around £2.75m, is in the form of his life having scored 10 goals in his last 20 games for club and country.</p>
      <p>Ginny, as he's known around Bodymoor Heath, fired in another two goals for Scotland during the international break to take his season-tally to double-figures, including three in 12 for Aston Villa.</p>

      <p>The all-action midfielder is believed to be worth more than £50m in today's market and signed a new five-year deal at Villa Park as recently as September.</p>
      <p>Smith, when asked if Villa are expected to keep hold of the likes of McGinn, said: "There's been a lot of speculation about a lot of players, but we've two owners who want to build a football club, challenging at the top half of this table, and top six in a few years' time.</p>
      <p>"To do that you have to keep your best players, and I've no doubts in my mind the owners will want to keep those players."</p>
      <h3>Aston Villa - End of Decade</h3>
      <p>Welcome to our Aston Villa 'End of Decade' series.</p>
      <p>We're looking back on the 'Teenies' - the last 10 years at AVFC.</p>
      <p>It's hardly been a vintage time for Villa, but at least it is ending with plenty of hope and optimism with the Lions finally back in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>There's been some lowlights, and a smattering of highlights from January 2010 to now - and we'll bring you a host of them here.</p>

      <p>Speaking of McGinn, who'll once again start in Villa's engine room on Monday night against Newcastle, Smith added: "He's improving every game he plays, he works hard in training, he's scoring goals at international level as well, so he just need to keep improving.</p>
      <p>"I've no doubt he will because he has a great head on his shoulders, he's an intelligent boy, but on top that he's a really good lad in the dressing room."</p>

      <p>The gaffer, meanwhile, reserved special mention to Monday's counterpart Bruce for signing the midfielder for peanuts in August 2018.</p>
      <p>"A great buy," Smith exlaimed. "I credited Steve at the end of the season at Wembley because both goal-scorers were brought in by Steve.</p>
      <p>"[McGinn] started to get accolades at Hibs, and Celtic were in for him, but Villa got ahead, and I'm very grateful for that."</p>
      <p>Villa are live on Sky Sports on Monday before trips to Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge before the TV cameras are at Villa Park again for the visit of bang-in-form Leicester City.</p>
      <p>When asked if such a platform could come at the wrong time given the window opens in less than six weeks, Smith said: "If they're showcasing their talents then it's the right time because they are playing well, and that's all I want from them."</p>
