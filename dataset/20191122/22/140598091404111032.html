      <p>Frank Lampard has claimed that Chelsea are now benefiting from the season he spent at Manchester City, even though he feared it could tarnish his Stamford Bridge reputation at the time.</p>
      <p>Having been allowed to leave Chelsea at the end of his contract in 2014, Lampard moved to City for a season before joining Major League Soccer club New York City.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/11111945/Manchester-City-1-Chelsea-1-Frank-Lampard-comes-off-the-bench-to-upset-former-club-and-save-the-champions.html">He scored against Chelsea,</a> who went on to win the Premier League title that season, on his first home appearance for City and angered Jose Mourinho who was in charge of the Blues.</p>
      <p>But Lampard retained the adoration of the Chelsea fans and, ahead of his first trip back to City as head coach, believes his season in Manchester was an important learning experience.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-time-kick-off-tv-channel/">Chelsea go into Saturday’s game</a> one point ahead of fourth-placed City and Lampard said: “I wanted to finish my (playing) career here at Chelsea. It didn’t work that way, but the year in Manchester, in terms of what I’m doing here now, was perfect for me.</p>

      <p>“It opened my eyes to another club, another structure, another dressing-room, another coaching philosophy, another idea. And then at New York, again that continued and that starts to shape what you’re thinking next.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho, who returned to management with Chelsea’s rivals Tottenham Hotspur this week, could not hide his frustration when Lampard scored against his team for City, saying: “When he decided to become a direct competitor of Chelsea, then love stories are over.”</p>
      <p>Asked about that comment, Lampard said: “At the time, I didn’t feel it was quite right, I have to say that. It was directly after the match and sometimes the emotions of the match, whether I scored the equalising goal, can affect the comment or type of comment.</p>
      <p>“The bigger picture on that one, for me, is the love story or not is probably always decided by the fans and the club, and it has been proven now. I am here managing the club, but even then I think a lot of people understood how I felt about Chelsea, always did, always will do regardless of the year at Manchester City.”</p>

      <p>Chelsea’s fans backed Lampard by singing his name even when he was wearing the City shirt and the 41-year-old confirmed that their reaction strengthened his bond with the club’s supporters.</p>
      <p>“The reaction of me going to Manchester City was something I was concerned about after 13 years here,” said Lampard. “I wondered at 36 whether a year there was something I should take on because of what I feel about this club.</p>
      <p>“And then my professional head, the challenge of it and the period I had where I wasn’t going to be playing before going to New York, all came together and made me take a decision which was quite tough at the time.</p>
      <p>“But to see then the feeling I got from the Chelsea fans on that day was an emotional thing for me and it hasn’t stopped from that day.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/12/chelseaplayers-face-fines-20000-leaked-list-highlightsfrank/">Lampard’s Chelsea fine list </a>was revealed during the international break and showed that anybody who turns up late for training is hit with an eye-watering £20,000 punishment.</p>
      <p>After admitting that Mourinho’s Chelsea fines were never that big, Lampard said: “I can understand it might sound harsh. It’s not harsh if you’re not late. It’s nothing.</p>
      <p>“I think we put in the discipline for one reason. My only concern when that came out was it makes me look like trying to be Mr Tough Guy. I’m not. We spoke with the players and I gave the list to (Cesar) Azpilicueta when we set out the fines.</p>
      <p>“In fact, I was asking him if there were any areas he could see because I wanted to know what happened last year, whether the players were happy, were they not. That came into the picture as well, so it’s certainly a bit of a joint effort.</p>
      <p>“Maybe the numbers were chosen by myself to a degree. I do think discipline is an important thing. I expect them to look after each other on the pitch and when they train, so I expect them to respect each other in terms of turning up.</p>
      <p>“If you talk about coming late to training, we arrive at 10am and we start training at 11am. So if you’re late for training, you’re over an hour late without any excuse, that’s quite a big deal if you’re preparing for a game against Man City on the next day.</p>
      <p>“I know the fines are relative, people can have their own opinion. But they were part of the process. I’m not here to be a dictator.”</p>
