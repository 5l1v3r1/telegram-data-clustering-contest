      <p>BDO Unibank, Inc. has been named the most outstanding financial institution in the Philippines based on the results of Asiamoney’s 2019 Asia’s Outstanding Companies Poll.</p>
      <p>The financial publication’s annual survey “recognizes publicly-listed companies across the region for their excellence in a variety of business areas and markets.” Winners from 12 markets in Asia are nominated and voted by over 800 fund managers, buy-side analysts, bankers, and ratings agencies.</p>
      <p>Ranking first in the finance cluster, BDO was awarded with the Most Outstanding Company in the Philippines – Financials Sector for the second time during the 2019 Asiamoney Best Banks Awards.</p>
      <p>For the seventh time, it also received the Best Domestic Bank Award and for the 1st time, the Best Private Bank Award for its subsidiary, BDO Private Bank.</p>
      <p>Asiamoney recognized BDO as the “bank to beat in the Philippines” and underscored its industry leadership with the strength of its total assets, the reach of its retail network, and the dominance it asserts in investment banking, private banking, credit cards, and insurance brokerage.</p>
      <p>As of the first half of 2019, BDO remains the country’s largest bank in terms of total assets, loans, deposits, and trust funds. Its assets currently stand at P3.1 trillion. Across the archipelago, it runs more than 1,400 branches and 4,000 ATMs.</p>
      <p>“Good execution of our strategy allowed us to further strengthen our various businesses and translate it to good financial results,” said BDO President and CEO Nestor Tan.</p>
