      <p>WARSAW: Do not poke the bear. A Polish TV channel learnt the truth of the saying on Friday (Nov 22), being forced to abandon plans to hold its <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/polish-bears-face-grizzly-wake-up-during-noisy-new-year-party-12108524">noisy New Year's Eve party</a> near bear caves.</p>
      <p>The TVP station - which hosts a gala event each New Year featuring concerts and a lot of drinking - wanted to relocate the party to Poland's most famous ski resort in the Tatra mountains.</p>

      <p>But a local newspaper said hibernating bears could be disturbed by the noise, sparking warnings from the Tatra National Park and a petition that was eventually signed by 28,000 people.</p>
      <p>TVP chief Jacek Kurski confirmed the event would move back to its previous location in the town of Zakopane, saying New Year's Eve "must unite us, not divide us".</p>
      <p>Zakopane officials also confirmed the location switch, saying they were "happy to have managed to convince TVP" to return to the town centre.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of protesters marched through Zakopane with a fake bear on a stretcher last week calling for TVP to relocate the event.</p>
      <p>The station initially branded the protesters "pseudo-ecologists" and argued that sports events had been held in the area without a problem.</p>
      <p>The TV station had originally said moving the event to the mountains would have provided protection from the wind.</p>
      <p>But the Tatra National Park had warned that the "noise and flashes made by fireworks and firecrackers trigger anxiety in animals, as well as a search for new spots and in the long term a drop in the birth rate".</p>
      <p>The statement added that a bear had died last year after being woken up on New Year's Eve.</p>
      <p>An expert from the park confirmed to AFP that there were Carpathian brown bears in the area, though he said precise numbers were not known.</p>
