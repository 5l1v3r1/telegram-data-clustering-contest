      <p>JOHN COONEY IS a huge believer in the power of positive thinking.</p>
      <p>And midway through a <a href="https://www.the42.ie/ulster-clermont-match-report-champions-cup-2-4903144-Nov2019/">tight and seriously tough second half against Clermont, he showed the value of it.</a></p>
      <p>Ulster’s star scrum-half was not hitting his usual flawless form despite Ulster holding a 13-6 lead. He spurned a gilt-edged chance in the first-half by trying to go it alone, and early in the second period he dropped two penalties to touch short of the line.</p>
      <p>And yet, when an opportunity arose on 62 minutes, he backed himself.</p>
      <p>“John said in the changing room there,” recounted Ulster boss Dan McFarland post-match, “that he has practised that exact move – breaking blind, chip the fullback and scoring.</p>
      <blockquote>Now, if anyone knows John that exactly the sort of thing he’d do. He’s been practising it for years and never done it in a game. So he pulls it out of the bag in a Champions Cup game.”</blockquote>
      <p>As the move unfolded and Cooney sniped with nobody in support, McFarland’s faith was severely, yet briefly, questioned.</p>

      <p>“I was in the box watching. There was a big shout of ‘no’ followed by a big shout of ‘yes’. John Cooney has a lot of tricks in his bag. He’s an incredibly skillful player and it was a great bit of play from him.”</p>
      <p>The win over the French giants sees Ulster move top of Heineken Champions Cup pool 3 on eight points, two ahead of Clermont as they collected a losing bonus in Belfast. It was a result that was hard-won, with the men from the Massif Centrale pushing for a smash and grab win until the death.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot to be very pleased about in that performance. Particularly the way we limited their opportunities when they had ball in hand.</p>

      <p>“I said before the game we had to hunt like a pack, we had to bring collective pressure and we had to do that consistently.<br/>“Jared (Payne, defence coach) and his preparation with the team and the effort the guys put in tonight did that.</p>
      <p>“On the reverse side of things, we showed some glimpses of what we can do in attack and if we’d been a little more clinical we might have had two more tries and the bonus point.</p>
