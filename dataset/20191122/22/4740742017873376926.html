      <p>Bristol Bears put in arguably their most dominant display under Pat Lam to beat Brive 36-0 in their own stadium on Friday night.</p>
      <p>The five try bonus point win, without conceding a point, put Bristol clear at the top of Pool 4 of the European Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p>The Bears crossed the line through Toby Fricker, Harry Randall, Piers O’Conor, Will Capon and Ed Holmes while Callum Sheedy kicked 11 points.</p>
      <p>Bristol Bears rugby writer John Evely takes a closer look at the individual performances from the Stade Amédée-Domenech.</p>
      <h3>15. Mat Protheroe - 8</h3>
      <p>The full back chose when to run and when to kick expertly throughout and showed that Charle Piutau is not the only one with dancing feet at the club, darting through an invisible gap to give the Bears momentum which led to Ed Holmes’ try.</p>
      <h3>14. Luke Morahan - 8</h3>
      <p>The winger looked dangerous every time he touched the ball, making a key break on the outside for Randall’s try.</p>
      <h3>13. Piers O’Conor - 8</h3>
      <p>The outside centre scored a try at the bottom of the maul but that was as much a team effort. Did well in defence to limit Brive’s chances and showed some nice handling skills. His added speed means he always leaves opposition defenders uneasy.</p>
      <h3>12. Sam Bedlow - 7</h3>
      <p>Outstandingly physical in defence to really set the tone in the Bristol backline. He certainly seems to punch above his weight in physical contacts. A couple of avoidable penalties.</p>
      <h3>11. Toby Fricker - 8</h3>
      <p>The winger finished his try excellently, showing tremendous strength to almost judo flip his attempted tackler and touch the ball down. He has impressive pace as well and sped pass his opposite number when he decided to back himself on the outside in the second half.</p>
      <h3>10. Callum Sheedy - 9</h3>
      <p>The fly-half had an almost flawless display, kicking five of his six kicks, most of which were from the touchline, to finish with 11 points. He was the architect of Randall’s try after dummying his way through the Brive defence and his quick feet ensured the French side never really contained him. Brave in defence against some huge ball carries who tried to target him.</p>
      <h3>9. Harry Randall - 8</h3>
      <p>Finished his try like all good scrum halves, tracking the break to be in the right place for the final pass. He ensured there was a regular supply of quick ball for the backs to work with and kicked of territory well.</p>
      <h3>1. Jake Woolmore - 8</h3>
      <p>The prop put in a huge shift in the front row against some monstrously large opposition and was the man getting all the pats on the back when Bristol won a key scrum penalty against the head.</p>
      <h3>2. Harry Thacker - 8</h3>
      <p>The hooker is not having the impact in attack which he did last season but is still doing all the basics of the job well which includes hitting his lineouts.</p>
      <h3>3. Max Lahiff - 7</h3>
      <p>The prop performed well in the set-piece before leaving the field early with an apparent injury.</p>
      <h3>4. Joe Joyce - 8</h3>
      <p>The second row put in an eye catching display with breaks down the outside and kick chases but it was his vital work in the tight which helped Bristol win the arm wrestle against Brive</p>
      <h3>5. Dave Attwood - 8</h3>
      <p>Some thunderous tackles and even a rare break with the ball in hand. He has brought some added power to his Bears pack which was missing last season</p>
      <h3>6. Steven Luatua - 9</h3>
      <p>The official man of the match was my star man as well. Sometimes I miss how much good work he does but it was impossible to today with the flanker simply everywhere in defence and attack after coming back earlier than expected from a hip injury. His performance was so good it was close to being a 10.</p>
      <h3>7. Dan Thomas - 8</h3>
      <p>The backrower operated at a stunning pace as he made himself a real nuisance at the breakdown while also chopping down plenty of Brive attackers.</p>
      <h3>8. Luke Hamilton - 8</h3>
      <p>The Scotish international has been a fine addition to the squad since joining on a short-term contract and looks more and more comfortable in the Bears side. I thought this was his best performance yet as he carried hard in heavy traffic and never took a backward step</p>
      <p><b>Replacements:</b> 16. Will Capon - 8, 17. Yann Thomas - 7, 18. Lewis Thiede - 8, 19. Ed Holmes - 8, 20. John Hawkins - 7, 21. Nic Stirzaker - 7, 22. Ioan Lloyd - 7, 23. Charlie Powell - 7.</p>
