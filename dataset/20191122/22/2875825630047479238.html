      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: X Factor: Celebrity's Try Star singer and rugby player Levi Davis, who performs alongside Thom Evans and Ben Foden, opens up on his tough childhood</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:06:42+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:06</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Rugby star Levi Davis has opened up about being in care as a ­youngster – and how it's spurring him on to Celebrity <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> success.</p>
      <p>Bath player Levi, 21, is in the ITV show’s semi-finals this weekend as part of trio Try Star along with Thom Evans and Ben Foden, both 34.</p>
      <p>Speaking before the show he talked about how he was separated from his older brothers growing up.</p>
      <p>He said: “They were 14 and 15, so they were put into older institutes. They weren’t at a family home, they were at a house.</p>
      <p>"They left at 16 and went home, but I was seven so I had a while to go.”</p>

      <p>He said initially it was “up and down” in foster care. He said: “I found it hard to adapt, was prone to running away and suffered from mood swings until around 12.</p>
      <p>“It was tough because I thought I was going to go home and never did. I’d miss my mum.</p>
      <p>"Once I was settled and got into a routine then things started to fall into place, my life started to turn around and I became just like any other kid, which was hugely important to fit in at school and not feel angry any more.”</p>

      <p>He said rugby gave him a focus for his anger issues.</p>
      <p>“I was upset at the system, upset at thinking life was trying to put me down all the time and thinking everything was out of my control, which is no real surprise during the early years,” he said.</p>
      <p>“You feel once things get you down, it’s very hard to get up.</p>
      <p>"But I’m so thankful that I’ve met so many really genuinely nice people who only ever did things for me out of love.</p>

      <p>“They couldn’t have known which direction my life was going to go –successfully studying at university, being a professional rugby player and singing on X Factor.</p>
      <p>"The fact it’s gone that way is thanks to them, their love and support.</p>
      <p>“When I think back to where I was and compare it to now – being out in LA filming at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> ’s house – it’s a pinch me moment.”</p>
