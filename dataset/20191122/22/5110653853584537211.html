      <p>Jarrett Allen is coming to the defense of his point guard.</p>
      <p>The Nets center addressed rumors about Kyrie Irving on Thursday as part of a <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2863751-jarrett-allen-on-kyrie-irving-kevin-durant-blocking-lebron-top-br-ama-quotes">Bleacher Report AMA</a>. Allen was asked how Irving acts in the locker room, a constant topic of conversation following Irving'stumultuous 2018-19 season with the Celtics.</p>
      <p>"He acts like a normal teammate," Allen said. "People say that he has mood swings, but that's a complete lie. He wants to see us succeed and do well if anything."</p>

      </p>
      <p>ESPN's Stephen A. Smith broughtconcerns back to the surface on a recent episode of "First Take" during a discussion about Boston's impressive start. After Max Kellermanpointed out how well the Celtics have played withoutIrving, Smith noted there are already rumblings about Irving's attitude.</p>
      <p>"I am not hearing good things about Kyrie in Brooklyn," Smith said. "I'm talking about — you're hearing, you're just hearing about the mood. People are putting stuff out there. I don't think it's fair. I don't know how accurate it is. But I am telling — if Kyrie's listening — I am telling you there is stuff circulating out there about him from an attitude perspective."</p>

      <p>Irving, who has missed Brooklyn's last three games with a shoulder injury, dismissed a separate <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27947336/for-culture-kd-kyrie-comes-next-nets">ESPN report</a> from earlier this season that detailed the team's discomfort regarding his "infamous mood swings."</p>
      <p>"Who cares what ESPN or anyone says?" Irving said <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/kyrie-irving-pushes-back-on-unflattering-portrayal-i-am-here-to-be-myself/14eeid3xtkw3o1pq7z6ge3mkud">back in October</a>. "I love myself. I love my family. I love my friends. I love playing basketball... I kind of expect that at this point, for everybody to say things like that. And I'm going to keep on smiling and doing me. I'm happy where I am, and that comes with it I guess.</p>
      <p>"They try to tear down some of the most peaceful people in the world, still, to this day, so it's gonna happen."</p>
      <p>The Nets will certainly continue to monitor Irving throughout the year, but they have bigger issues at the moment. Brooklyn is just 6-8 overall and has lost four of its last six games heading into Friday night's contest against the Kings. In addition to Irving, the Nets are also waiting on the return ofCaris LeVert, who will likely be out until mid-December following thumb surgery.</p>
      <p>Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson has the tough task of guiding this group through an early rough patch — and staying on the same page with Irving should any issues arise.</p>
