      <p>With the complete Iist of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/ipl-2020-complete-list-of-players-released-and-retained-by-all-eight-franchises">released and retained players</a> for IPL 2020 out, the franchises will now be working out how they need to approach the auctions to be held at Kolkata on 19 December. While a number of big names were retained by the eight franchises, there were a few surprises as well in the list of released players.</p>
      <p>However, all is not lost for the players who do not have a team as of now. They will go back into the bidding race, and while this usually means getting a lower bid as opposed to the previous year, some might even end up getting luckier.</p>
      <p>If the released players perform exceptionally well in the lead-up to the auction, there might be a rare case for them getting a higher salary than the previous season. Here, we take a look at three released players who are likely to get big bids again at the IPL 2020 auction.</p>
      <h4>#1 Chris Lynn</h4>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/kolkata-knight-riders">Kolkata Knight Riders</a> releasing Australian power hitter <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/chris-lynn">Chris Lynn</a> was arguably the biggest surprise at the end of the trading window. Lynn is without an IPL contract in the pre-auction period, but he is the leading run-scorer in the T10 League with 288 runs in 6 matches at an incredible strike rate of 246.15. He has three fifties in the tournament so far, and he even smashed the record for the highest score in the league with a 30-ball 91.</p>
      <p>In fact, by no means did Lynn have a poor IPL 2019. He notched up 405 runs in 13 games at a strike rate of 139.65 with four fifties. In the edition before that, he amassed 491 runs at a strike rate of 130.23. And even though he played only seven games in 2017, Lynn blasted 295 runs at a strike rate of 180.98.</p>
      <p>Lynn will definitely get a franchise in 2020. Whether KKR purchase him again remains to be seen.</p>
