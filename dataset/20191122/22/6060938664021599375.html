      <p>MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday appointed a banker, an insurance CEO and a mutual fund representative to advise the administrator on DHFL. The advisers were named even as a former SBI chief general manager Vaijinath M Gavarshetty took charge as CEO reporting to the administrator. Gavarshetty earlier oversaw SBI’s home loan vertical at the bank’s headquarters in Mumbai.</p>
      <p>The panel members are IDFC First Bank chairman Rajiv Lall, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance managing director &amp; CEO N S Kannan, and Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) CEO N S Venkatesh.</p>
      <p>In the past, after DHFL defaulted on its debt obligations, one of the reasons that lenders didn’t agree on a resolution plan was that mutual funds and banks differed over the resolution. Unlike banks, which have more flexibility in recognising bad loans, mutual funds have to catergorise any delay in repayment as a default and make provisions accordingly. The new advisory panel is now expected to help resolve differences between the different category of lenders.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the RBI had superseded the board of directors of DHFL and appointed R Subramaniakumar as the administrator. Following the supersession of the board, the company had cancelled the board meeting scheduled for November 25 to declare financial results.</p>
      <p>“The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Rules, 2019, provide for the concerned financial sector regulator appointing a committee of advisers to advise the administrator in the operations of the financial service provider during the corporate insolvency resolution process,” the RBI said.</p>
