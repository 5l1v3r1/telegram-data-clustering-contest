      <p>A viral video posted online on Friday by the progressive veterans group Common Defense shows Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina abruptly walking away from a Marine veteran who approached Graham to ask him about impeachment.</p>
      <p>Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a staunch ally of President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4">Donald Trump</a>, has been one of the president’s most vocal defenders as Trump faces impeachment.</p>
      <p>The video shows the Marine veteran Jeff Key approach Graham in the halls of Congress on Wednesday. Key’s Twitter profile describes him as a “former Marine, Iraq veteran, peace activist, and queer civil rights activist.” Graham also has a military background, serving in the Judge Advocate General Corps in the Air Force in the 1980s and continuing to serve in the Air Force Reserves after being elected to Congress.</p>

      <p>“I see how you’re berated in the press, and I honestly believe that you believe in our democracy as I do,” Key says in the video. “I came to DC because I’m a Marine, I went to Iraq, and I believe, as I believe that you do, that President Trump is not acting in accordance to his oath, the oath that you took and I did to defend the constitution.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah I did, and I don’t agree with you and I gotta go,” Graham says before walking away into his office.</p>
      <p>A Common Defense spokesperson told Insider that Key traveled to Washington from Louisiana as one of 65 veterans who traveled to DC this week “to engage with members of Congress and persuade them to support impeachment of Donald Trump.”</p>
      <p>“Jeff Key was deeply disappointed in Sen. Graham, and had hoped that they could have had a genuine conversation,” Common Defense said. “Unfortunately, Lindsey Graham has made clear that he is more interested in subverting the constitutional process of investigating Trump’s crimes, than having serious engagement with concerned veterans.”</p>
      <p>The video now has over 1 million views on Twitter alone and has spurred plentiful criticism of Graham, with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/lindsey-graham-runs-from-veteran-916807/">a headline in Rolling Stone</a> about the incident reading, “Lindsey Graham Is a Coward, Exhibit 39204.”</p>
      <p>A representative for Graham, however, told Insider that the viral video doesn’t show the whole story of their interaction.</p>
      <p>The spokesman Kevin Bishop said in a Friday email that after the point at which the clip ended, Key “actually followed Senator Graham after he walked away” into his office, where Key “made his way towards the door and proceeded to make a vulgar comment” but did not enter Graham’s office.</p>
      <p>Bishop additionally said Graham’s staff immediately contacted Capitol Police, which gave Graham police protection for traveling between Senate hearings and his congressional office.</p>
