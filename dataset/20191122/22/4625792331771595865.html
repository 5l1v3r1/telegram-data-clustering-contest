      <h1>Michael Bloomberg set to spend more in one week on TV ad blitz than any candidate ever</h1>

      <p>Michael Bloomberg will spend tens of millions of dollars on television ads, which would set a record, in at least 100 media markets across the country starting next week, a sign that he could announce his presidential campaign in the coming days.</p>
      <p>The ads, some of which are 60 seconds long, are expected to air from Nov. 25 through Dec. 3. They are expected to cost Bloomberg at least $30 million, the <i>New York Times</i> <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bloomberg-places-upward-254-million-worth-television-ads/story?id=67235779">and</a> ABC <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/us/politics/bloomberg-ads-2020-race.html?partner=IFTTT">reported</a>. The sum is more than half of the about $50 million all the other Democratic presidential candidates combined have spent on television ads this year, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-campaign-ads/#">according</a> to FiveThirtyEight.</p>
      <p>Ad spending tracking group <a href="https://twitter.com/Ad_Analytics/status/1197986788796780544">Advertising Analyics</a> said that the ad buy would be the largest-ever sum spent in one week by a candidate. President Barack Obama holds the current record of $24.9 million spent during the last week of his presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>The former New York mayor has filed to appear on Democratic primary ballots in some states and, on Thursday, filed statement of candidacy <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/michael-bloomberg-files-fec-paperwork-for-presidential-bid">paperwork</a> with the Federal Election Commission. But his team indicated that the steps were formalities while he decides whether to launch a presidential campaign, and he has yet to announce a bid personally.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, who is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg/#1d3b848b1417">worth</a> an estimated $54 billion, is expected to self-finance his campaign and skip competing in the first four early nominating contest states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. Instead, he will focus on winning delegates from primaries on the March 3 "Super Tuesday" and beyond.</p>
      <p>Tom Steyer, a former hedge-fund manager worth <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2019/07/09/how-tom-steyer-made-his-16-billion-fortune/">about</a> $1.6 billion who is also largely self-financing his campaign, is the only other presidential candidate to spend unusually large sums of money on television ads so far in the 2020 cycle. He has spent <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-campaign-ads/#candidate=tom-steyer">about</a> $39 million so far on television ads.</p>
      <p>Other Democratic presidential candidates have <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/attempt-to-buy-the-presidency-2020-democrats-slam-looming-bloomberg-bid">criticized</a> Bloomberg's expected late entry into the large field of candidates and accused him of trying to buy the election.</p>
