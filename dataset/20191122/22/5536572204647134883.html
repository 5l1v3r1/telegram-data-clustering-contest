      <h1>52% of Fans Says MLB Should Strip Houston Astros of 2017 Title</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:15:28+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:15</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>The Houston Astros are likely to receive a punishment that hasn’t been seen in quite sometime as Major League Baseball continues its investigation into allegations of sign-stealing by the team during their 2017 Championship run as well as 2018 and 2019 seasons.</p>
      <p>A bunch of fans would like for MLB to take the NCAA approach and vacate their title altogether.</p>
      <p>According to a recent poll by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschlossberg/2019/11/21/if-guilty-as-charged-astros-should-lose-2017-title-new-poll-insists/#54a588e61824">Seton Hall University</a>, we know now just how many people would actually love to see that. 52 percent of people would love to the Astros stripped of their championship in 2017.</p>
      <p>That has never happened in professional sports before, and is highly unlikely to happen in this situation.</p>
      <p>It should also be noted that 69 percent of people in that same poll believe other teams also use electronic devices to steal signs. Only 15 percent felt as if the electronic sign stealing was more than serious then the use of PEDs.</p>
      <p>As the most, the team will get lengthy suspensions, loss of draft picks, and a huge fine to make sure they or nobody else tries to do this again.</p>
