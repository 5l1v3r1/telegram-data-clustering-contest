        <b>JO Swinson was tonight branded a joker for claiming she can still be Prime Minister — despite being a distant third in the polls.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Lib Dems leader insisted it was “absolutely possible” she could walk into No10 next month.</p>

        <figcaption>Jo Swinson has been branded a joker by rivals for thinking she can be PM</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>But with latest opinion polls showing her party has slumped to 15 per cent across the UK, the SNP said she was “either a joker or delusional”.</p>
      <p>And her boast came just a day after her deputy Sir Ed Davey predicted that a Tory minority government was the “most likely result” of the December 12 ballot.</p>
      <p>Asked in Glasgow about her chances of becoming PM, she said: “Not a single vote has been cast. This is an election and people get to choose — so it’s absolutely possible.”</p>
      <p>She added: “People can choose better than Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn.”</p>

      <p>It came as Ms Swinson — also hoping to retain her seat in East Dunbartonshire — hit the campaign trail in the city after an earlier stop in Sheffield.</p>
      <p>And she was quickly heckled over her ministerial role in former Premier David Cameron’s coalition government, which forced through public spending cuts blamed for pushing many people into poverty.</p>
      <p>Strathclyde Uni student Jay Sutherland — who said he plans to vote Labour — approached her after her battlebus parked next to Finnieston Crane.</p>
      <p>He told her the effects of austerity on locals had been “unforgivable”, adding: “People are dying here in poverty because of what you’ve done with austerity.</p>
      <p>"I know people who have suffered so much, it breaks my heart."</p>
      <p>Flanked by Scottish Lib Dem chief Willie Rennie, Ms Swinson replied: “I’d encourage you to look at what our plans are in this election.”</p>
      <p>But Mr Sutherland branded the Lib Dem manifesto “not good enough” and accused the party of “betraying students” in England, where they broke a promise to push for scrapping tuition fee after going into government with the Tories.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson, who was an employment minister between 2012 and 2015, said he was “entitled to that view”.</p>
      <p>But the student hit back: “I think it’s sad you’re here in Glasgow when this is the city hit hardest by austerity.”</p>

      <p>At the event, Ms Swinson, expecting an SNP challenge to her 5,339 majority, dubbed the Nats and Tories the “terrible twins of division”.</p>
      <p>She said: “For the last decade Scots have been waking up to division and chaos. First independence, then Brexit and now talk of independence again.</p>
      <p>“The SNP and Conservatives have brought us all this division and are sowing even more.</p>
      <p>“Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson are the terrible twins of division.”</p>
      <p>Mr Rennie insisted his party had “learned the lessons” of the coalition with the Tories.</p>
      <blockquote>"Jo Swinson is either a joker or delusional if she believes she will be in Downing Street for anything more than a second stint as a minister in a Tory government.”<cite>Pete Wishart, SNP</cite></blockquote>
      <p>He said: “We understood what we got right and what we got wrong. Some people will just focus on what we got wrong.</p>
      <p>“There is a balance. These were difficult times and we did what we had to do.</p>
      <p>“I think our manifesto recognises those challenges and wants to put those right.”</p>
      <p>But the SNP’s Pete Wishart said: “The irony will not be lost on voters, given Jo Swinson’s eagerness to twin with the Tories and inflict devastating cuts to Scots communities.”</p>

      <p>The Nat, defending a majority of just 21 in Perth and North Perthshire, added: “With the Lib Dems hopelessly trailing in the polls and SNP the main challenger in every Tory-held seat in Scotland, Jo Swinson is either a joker or delusional if she believes she will be in Downing Street for anything more than a second stint as a minister in a Tory government.”</p>
      <p>The row capped a bruising week for Ms Swinson, whose party has slumped from 20 per cent across the UK last month to 15 now. Latest polling puts them way behind Labour on 30 per cent and the Tories on 42.</p>
      <p>While in Scotland they sit on 13 per cent — just above toiling Labour but trailing the Tories on 22 and the Nats on 42 per cent.</p>
      <p>And Ms Swinson came under fire from the SNP after saying in ITV’s General Election debate on Tuesday she’d be prepared to launch a nuclear strike if PM.</p>
      <p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon slated her stance, calling the Clyde-based deterrent “immoral, ineffective and a waste of money”.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dem manifesto, out this week, shows the party wants “multilateral disarmament”.</p>
      <p>But Ms Swinson yesterday insisted our arsenal of nukes can only be effective if there is a chance they will be used.</p>
      <p>She said: “I answered that question honestly and clearly.</p>
      <p>“I think that if a deterrent is to be effective, then that has to be the situation.”<br/><a href="mailto:chris.musson@the-sun.co.uk">chris.musson@the-sun.co.uk</a></p>
