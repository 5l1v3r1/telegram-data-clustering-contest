      <p>M. Siddharth showed nerves of steel on his debut said, “my aim was to keep things simple and not give any width for the batsmen to free their arms.</p>
      <p>“I knew the Mumbai batsmen will come hard at me and the plan was to keep varying my pace.”</p>
      <p>The left-arm spinner was unafraid to toss the ball. “I knew Shreyas likes to attack at the start of his innings so I backed myself and thankfully it worked out. Suryakumar’s wicket was special because it was my first wicket for Tamil Nadu.”</p>
      <p>He recently starred in the U-23 competition, picking 15 wickets from eight games. He has been prolific in the TNCA first division, picking 52 wickets in 2017-18 and 43 in 2018-19 for Alwarpet CC before moving to Grand Slam this season.</p>
