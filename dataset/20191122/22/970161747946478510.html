      <p>Some of the celebs in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> main camp were a tad ‘disappointed’ at Cliff Parisi’s arrival – as they were hoping for a treat instead.</p>
      <p>Even Declan Donnelly noticed the ‘lukewarm welcome’.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/who-is-im-a-celebritys-cliff-parisi-married-to-11202822/">Cliff entered the jungle as a late arrival</a> to the show with new fan-favourite and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-new-campmates-andy-whyment-and-cliff-parisi-pose-with-aussie-wildlife-ahead-of-jungle-debut-11183275/">fellow soap actor Andrew Whyment</a>.</p>
      <p>The actor is best known for appearing as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/who-did-cliff-parisi-play-in-eastenders-as-he-joins-im-a-celebrity-2019-cast-11195980/">Minty Peterson in EastEnders</a> for eight years from 2002 until 2010 as well as appearing on Casualty, Hollyoaks and Call the Midwife.</p>
      <p>It all began when James Haskell and Caitlyn Jenner went to see Kiosk Kev – and as they did they were greeted by a scroll asking them which outlaw they’d like to free for $100 from the Jungle Jailhouse – Andy or Cliff.</p>
      <p>James turned to Caitlyn and joked: ‘I tell you what, I’d rather a bag of crisps or chocolate bar if I’m completely honest with you.’</p>

      <p>James and Caitlyn told Kiosk Kev they’d like to free Cliff.</p>
      <p>Although not everyone was happy with their decision, especially Nadine Coyle as she was hoping for chocolate instead (ouch poor Cliff).</p>
      <p>Caitlyn and James returned to the main camp to explain their news – and there were a lot of disappointed faces.</p>
      <p>Cliff arrived to the main camp and Nadine exclaimed: ‘I felt sorry for Cliff as there was high hopes for a phone call and come chocolate and then Cliff came which was great but I think there was a “oh, they’re back and they’ve not got any chocolate”.’</p>
      <p>Viewers felt sorry for poor Cliff as they took to social media to share their thoughts about it.</p>
