        <b>Aboubakar Kamara's first goals of the season fired Fulham to a 2-1 derby victory over west London rivals QPR.</b>
      </p>
      <p>French striker Kamara, whose career at Craven Cottage looked over last term, scored in each half to cancel out Jordan Hugill's opener for Rangers.</p>
      <p>Victory moved Scott Parker's side up to fourth in the Championship to boost their bid for an instant return to the top flight.</p>
      <p>Rangers were ahead inside three minutes, when Todd Kane drilled a low centre across goal and Hugill, on a season-long loan from West Ham, arrived at the far post to steer the ball into the net.</p>
      <p>Fulham's calamitous defending underpinned their relegation from the Premier League last season and it seemed little had changed when Tim Ream inadvertently almost doubled Rangers' lead. The centre-half slid in to cut out another Kane cross and planted the ball straight onto the foot of his own post.</p>

      <p>At the other end of the pitch Fulham were missing 12-goal striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, the Championship's top scorer, through suspension.</p>
      <p>His place was taken by Kamara, who in January was arrested after a clash at Fulham's training ground, banned from the club and eventually sent on loan to Turkish side Malatyaspor.</p>
      <p>When Denis Odoi crossed from the right Kamara, making only his second start of the season, helped himself to his first Fulham goal since netting the consolation in a 4-1 defeat at Arsenal on New Year's Day.</p>
      <p>Odoi's delivery was perfect and Kamara slipped between two defenders to head into the bottom corner, meaning Rangers remain the only club in the entire Football League yet to keep a clean sheet this term.</p>
      <p>Fulham's tails were up and five minutes later Tom Cairney fed Ivan Cavaleiro, who got beyond Grant Hall but crashed his shot against the near post.</p>
      <p>Anthony Knockaert, who had endured a quiet first half for Fulham, came alive after the interval when he tiptoed into the QPR area and forced a fine stop from Joe Lumley.</p>
      <p>Fulham's pressure told in the 65th minute when Lumley's poor clearance fell straight to the feet of Stefan Johansen. The Norwegian midfielder played the ball through to Kamara, who took a touch before beating Lumley inside the far post.</p>
      <p>Knockaert almost doubled Fulham's winning margin when his shot beat Lumley but came back off the inside of the post.</p>
