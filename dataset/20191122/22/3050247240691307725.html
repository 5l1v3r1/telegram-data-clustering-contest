      </p>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) started the day just above the $7,600 price mark, when it suddenly started on another sell-off towards the $7,000 price level. The coin bounced off a local low of $6,800 in recent hours, before moving up to its current trading price at $7,300, showing a loss of close to 4% on the day.</p>
      <p>The world’s largest cryptocurrency is down around 15% from the weekly open of $8,500 and has dragged the entire crypto market into red territory. </p>

      <h3>BTC could be testing below the $7,000 price mark</h3>
      <p>Popular crypto analyst and regular Cointelegraph contributor Filb Filb recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/after-testing-7k-is-bitcoin-price-finally-close-to-the-bottom">said</a> that after looking at the daily chart, “it is clear that Bitcoin has hit the bottom of the downward channel in which it has been trading since July.”</p>
      <p>However, Filb Filb pointed out that the price point of $7,600 will be a key level for the bulls to reclaim, which might turn out to be a challenge, especially in the short term. He said:</p>
      <blockquote>“Probability would suggest BTC/USD will need to spend a little more time testing below $7,000 before there is a significant bullish reversal.”</blockquote>
      <p>Previously Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-drops-below-73k-as-china-vows-to-dispose-of-exchanges">reported</a> that Bitcoin tanked due to the multiple rumors currently going around about a crackdown on legitimate Chinese outposts of cryptocurrency businesses. The news appeared to rattle the crypto markets, which slipped into a downwards spiral ever since.</p>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), meanwhile, saw a painful drop in sync with BTC earlier today. The number one altcoin bounced of its daily low at $141, showing double-digit losses of more than 10% on the day, before moving up to its current trading price of $154 per coin.</p>

      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index">XRP</a>, the third-largest coin by market capitalization, has continued to lose ground and currently sits at $0.232 per coin, showing a loss of more than 3% at press time. </p>

Huobi Token (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/huobi-token-ht">HT</a>) follows closely with a loss of 9% at press time.</p>
      <p>The overall cryptocurrency market cap dropped below the 200 billion mark. It currently sits around $198.7 billion, with Bitcoin making up 66.3% of the total.</p>
