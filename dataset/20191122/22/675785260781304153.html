      <h2>Tottenham's new manager was quick to issue a hands-off warning to potential suitors and explained how keeping hold of Spurs' talisman is one of the club's priorities</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Lewis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-lewis/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> has warned Europe’s biggest clubs - forget about signing <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/harry-kane">Harry Kane</a> .</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Spurs</a> boss believes the next step for the dual Golden Boot winner is winning the title - and that he will do so in north London.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> continue to covet the Chingford-born England captain who scored four goals in two games during the international break, against Montenegro and Kosovo.</p>
      <p>In total Kane has scored 20 goals in all competitions this season with over six months of the campaign to go.</p>
      <p>While Spurs have previously lived with the concern of their marksman being tempted away, Mourinho believes his own track record - combined with chairman Daniel Levy’s unwillingness to sell - will keep Kane at the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> Hotspur Stadium.</p>

      <p>Mourinho said: “He’s one of the best strikers in the world, no doubt. He just needs his team, with him.</p>
      <p>“If his team is England or if his team is Tottenham, he just needs his team to go with him to the next level. And what is the next level? Titles.</p>
      <p>“I think he needs to win, with us, with England, he needs to bring something to highlight the quality that he has as a player. The goals he scores, what he brings to the team. Top striker. And I’ve worked with some of the top ones.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho clarified he did not make Levy promise to keep Kane. The Portuguese insisted it was the other way around.</p>

      <p>He added: “This is not about me. This is about Mr Levy, this is about the club. He has a vision, and part of that vision is to make the club better, bigger.</p>
      <p>“There is no better and bigger football club without a bigger and better football team. So keep the best players, is obviously part of that plan.</p>
      <p>“It was not like a promise to me, it was not like I said ‘I only go if’, there were no ‘ifs’.</p>
      <p>“It was him [Levy], part of his explanation about his vision for the club. That without being specific about the players, he told me he does not sell players when the manager doesn’t want to sell.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho revealed he tried to sign a string of Spurs players during his time at his former clubs. He added: “I am not telling the ones recently, I’ll go back further.</p>
      <p>“Lucas Moura, when he was at Sao Paulo, before he was transferred to Paris Saint Germain. I tried to get him to Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>“I met his mum, I met his dad, I met his agent, we spoke in Madrid, but Paris Saint Germain came into the picture and we didn’t get him.</p>
      <p>“It’s just an example that I say because it was a long time ago, but some others recently, and some others we don’t even think about buying, because we know it’s the impossible thing to do. So you just admire the player, wish to have him, but forget about it.”</p>
