      <p>Doctor Luka Kovač from ER has been announced for the cast of Doctor Who and will join the likes of Lenny Henry and Stephen Fry in the star-studded line-up.</p>
      <p>Goran Visnjic who played Doctor Luka from season six in the American series has been cast alongside Robert Glenister – who will be making a return to the show 35 years after his first appearance.</p>
      <p>The countdown has well and truly began for the return of Doctor Who which will hit our screens in 2020.</p>
      <p>After previously starring in Doctor Who over three decades ago, Robert is no stranger to the TARDIS and as he takes on a new character, and it’s safe to say emotions will be charged as he meets the Doctor and her friends.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of his debut Doctor Who appearance, Goran commented:  ‘I’ve always been a huge fan of Doctor Who, so when the offer to play one of my favourite people in history came, it made me so happy to be part of the show and it turned into this awesome, dream job.’</p>

      <p>Robert exclaimed: ‘I first appeared in Doctor Who in The Caves of Androzani at the tender age of 24 in 1984. Thirty five years later I got to be in it again at the not so tender age of nearly 60. How time flies.’</p>

      <p>Matt Strevens, Executive Producer added: ‘One of the great joys of Doctor Who are the legendary actors who want to come and join in the Doctor’s adventures. We were thrilled to welcome Goran and Robert, whose worked we’ve loved and admired for years. They create two iconic characters who are going to delight and entertain.’</p>

      <p>Stephen Fry has also recently expressed his excitement after being cast for a guest role in series 12.</p>
      <p>He explained: ‘Short of being picked for a British space exploration programme and I readily concede that I’m past the age where I’d be considered (if I was ever the right age for such a posting) – then being in an episode of Doctor Who will certainly do as a very sweet second-place excitement.’</p>

      <p>Sir Lenny, equally excited, added: ‘It was absolutely brilliant to be welcomed into the fantastical world of Doctor Who. The nearest I have been to the TARDIS was when I played the Caribbean Doctor in the Lenny Henry Show , so as a life-long (hiding behind the sofa type) Doctor Who fan this is a very special moment for me.’</p>
