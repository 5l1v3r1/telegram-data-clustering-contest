      <h1>Jack Wilshere a West Ham injury doubt to face Jose Mourinho's Spurs despite training return</h1>
      <h2>The Hammers midfielder has been back in training but suffered a setback</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini revealed Jack Wilshere is an injury concern for West Ham and their hosting of Jose Mourinho's Spurs at London Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Wilshere had returned to training having been out for a month with what was initially a "small" problem which turned out to actually be quite a significant one, missing the last three games.</p>
      <p>The Hammers midfielder hasn't started in the Premier League since the second game of the season, a 1-1 draw with Brighton, and was hauled off at half time in that game as injuries yet again hamper the former Arsenal man.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini was asked about the midfielder's fitness after some confusion initially in his first answer about the availability of Wilshere, Michail Antonio and Mark Noble - the latter two are fit for selection.</p>
      <p>And West Ham's manager was less than convincing in his answer on Wilshere, saying: "Wilshere was working normally until yesterday (Wednesday) when he had a small problem.</p>
      <p>"We will see tomorrow (Friday) if he is able to be on the squad list.</p>

      <p>"It's a small pain that he has behind his stomach. It's a small thing but it bothers him a little bit so he must be 100 per cent [to play].</p>
      <p>As mentioned, the Hammers have been handed a boost as Antonio and Noble have come through their respective injuries and could feature on Saturday against Spurs.</p>
      <p>Antonio has been out since August with a torn hamstring that required surgery while Noble twisted his ankle in the dire 3-0 defeat to Burnley prior to the international break but has recovered.</p>
      <p>On that duo, the manager added: "They are important players for us, Antonio had a long injury and makes things happen in attacking, Mark Noble is the captain of the team.</p>
      <p>"They are able to play."</p>
