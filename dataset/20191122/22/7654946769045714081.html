      <p>A 17-year-old Queens girl who was stabbed to death hours after attending a memorial for <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/victim-in-late-night-stabbing-identified-as-queens-teen/">her family friend, Aamir Griffin</a> may have been a victim of a premeditated crime, according to police Friday.</p>
      <p>Tyler Caldwell, 20, was arrested and charged on Tuesday <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/victim-in-late-night-stabbing-identified-as-queens-teen/">i</a>n connection to the murder of Talasia Cuffie –- who was stabbed<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/woman-fatally-stabbed-in-queens-suspect-at-large/"> in the chest and groin on Friday, Nov. 15</a> just before 10 p.m. on 166th Street in South Jamaica, police said.</p>
      <p>Cuffie was found laying on the sidewalk for a half-hour before a neighbor heard her cries for help and called 911, police said.</p>
      <p>Caldwell faces charges of conspiracy and criminal facilitation for allegedly organizing via text message for Cuffie to meet up at an agreed-upon location –– where he knew the two suspects would be waiting, according to the criminal complaint.</p>
      <p>One of the two suspects –– who police are still looking for –– wanted to fight Cuffie, having mentioned she wanted to stab the victim, according to the complaint.</p>
      <p>“That bitch is dead. I poked her twice,” Caldwell alleges she told him the day following the stabbing.</p>
      <p>The motive for Caldwell’s involvement is still under investigation.</p>
      <p>Caldwell is set to appear back in court on Dec. 2.</p>
