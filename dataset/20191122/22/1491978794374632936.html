        <i>Transport minister Andrew Constance confirms project coming in at $1.3bn more than first forecast</i>

      <p>The cost of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/03/nsw-government-to-pay-576m-extra-to-sydney-light-rail-subcontractors">Sydney’s light rail</a> project has blown out to $2.9bn, with New South Wales’s transport minister acknowledging the project has been a “difficult build”.</p>
      <p>The final construction cost was confirmed by Andrew Constance’s office on Friday evening, coming in at $1.3bn more than first forecast.</p>
      <p>Constance said no one was denying that the light rail construction has been difficult.</p>
      <p>“We took the busiest street in the nation and ripped [it] up to transform it into the open, inviting boulevard it is today,” he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Daytime trial runs between Town Hall and Circular Quay began in August, with the line due to open to the public in December.</p>
      <p>The service will move 6,570 people in both directions during peak times, with each 67-metre tram able to carry up to nine standard busloads of passengers, Constance said.</p>
      <p>“It’s a really exciting time for this project and I can’t wait until everyone gets to jump on board and ride this fantastic transport solution,” he said.</p>
      <p>The NSW Labor leader, Jodi McKay, criticised the government’s management of the project.</p>
      <p>“Not only is the light rail already a year late but now we’ve learned it’s $1.3bn over budget,” McKay said in a statement on Friday. “This is a testament to the Liberals’ bad management.</p>
      <p>“The money for this government’s blowouts on major infrastructure projects has to come from somewhere.”</p>
      <p>“They can’t do everything so they will either have to privatise or cut.”</p>
