      <p>WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump claimed Friday (Nov 22) that were it not for him, Hong Kong "would have been obliterated in 14 minutes" by Chinese troops.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Fox News, Trump said President Xi Jinping refrained from sending in the military against <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/hong-kong-protests-surrender-polytechnic-university-students-12116452">demonstrators</a> in the semi-autonomous city only because he asked him to.</p>

      <p>"If it weren't for me, Hong Kong would have been obliterated in 14 minutes," Trump said.</p>
      <p>Xi "has a million soldiers standing outside of Hong Kong, are not going only because I asked him. 'Please don't do that. You will be making a big mistake. It will have a tremendous negative impact on the trade deal.'"</p>
      <p>In the same interview, Trump said Washington and Beijing could be on the cusp of sealing a partial trade deal but reiterated he was in no hurry to sign.</p>
      <p>But Trump's remarks were a rejoinder to <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/china-s-xi-says-he-wants-to-work-out-initial-trade-deal-with-us-12117204">statements made hours earlier</a> by Xi, who had told a gathering of dignitaries in Beijing that China wanted a deal but was "not afraid" to fight back if needed.</p>
      <p>"We have a deal, potentially very close," Trump said during his interview.</p>
      <p>"He wants to make a deal much more than I want to make it. I'm not anxious to make it."</p>
      <p>Trump added that revenues from tariffs on Chinese imports were a windfall for the United States, something economists say is in fact weighing on the economy.</p>
      <p>Trump's remarks did little to clarify whether the two parties are in fact making progress in finalising the text of the "phase one" agreement Trump announced last month.</p>
      <p>China has called for a rollback of existing US tariffs as part of the agreement but US officials have said instead they could consider delaying a fresh round of duty increases that are set to take effect on Dec 15.</p>
      <p>The US-trade conflict is now well into its second year, with hundreds of billions of dollars in two-way trade subject to steep duties.</p>
