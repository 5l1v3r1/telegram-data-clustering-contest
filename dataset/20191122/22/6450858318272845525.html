      <h2>The phone is expected to launch around March, so the leaks are beginning to emerge</h2>

      <p>2020’s first big smartphone release is the Samsung Galaxy S11 and what looks like the first reliable render of its design has leaked. If accurate, the images suggest the S11 will gain three traits from the Note 10 series – a central front camera cut out, vertically aligned rear cameras and the removal of the headphone jack.</p>
      <p>The leaks come courtesy of the now-familiar partnership of trusted tech leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1197833371516329985">OnLeaks</a> and site <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3778463-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fmobile-phone%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s11-render-leaks-note-10-design-3778463%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.91mobiles.com%2Fhub%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s11-render-design-exclusive">91Mobiles</a>. Citing his “<a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1197844864270061573?s=20">very reliable and first lvl (sic) industry source</a>”, OnLeaks has been accurate in the past over major phone renders, most recently with the OnePlus 7T series.</p>
      <p>The design looks like an iterative update to the S10 series with the familiar curved edges to the display and aluminium band around the device. The leak is of the regular S11 with a single front facing camera.</p>
      <p>The article suggests there will be an S11e and S11 Plus, though details on those models are scant and we don’t know if the S11 Plus will have two front cameras like the S10 Plus. The report claims the S11 Plus will be a 5G-only phone, while the S11e and S11 will have 4G or 5G options.</p>

      <p>The pictured S11 will have a 6.3-6.7in screen, though OnLeaks claims to know the exact dimensions are 161.9 x 73.7 x 7.8mm.</p>
      <p>With three rear cameras pictured and what we assume is a 3D time of flight sensor, the S11 in this configuration would be similar to the Note 10 Plus. A render clearly shows this will likely also be the first Galaxy S phone to lose the headphone jack, just as the Note 10 was the first Note to do so.</p>
      <p>A final interesting rumour is that the S11 will have a 120Hz capable display, one-upping the Pixel 4 and OnePlus 7T’s 90Hz panels. The Razer Phone 2 is one of the only phones on the market capable of 120Hz, the same refresh rate found on Apple’s latest iPad Pro.</p>
