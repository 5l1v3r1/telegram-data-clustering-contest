      <p>Frank Lampard has insisted he is not a “Mr Tough Guy” manager despite confirming Chelsea’s new hefty fines structure was his idea.</p>
      <p>The Blues boss said money levied from player fines will be donated to charities, with the recently leaked list of internal fines showing anyone late for training will face a £20,000 penalty.</p>
      <p>Lampard revealed he sat down with captain Cesar Azpilicueta to draw up the list before the start of the season, and maintained that the punishments are not draconian.</p>
      <p>“I can understand it might sound harsh but it’s not harsh if you’re not late; that’s one thing,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I think we put in the discipline for one reason.</p>
      <p>“My only concern when that came out was it makes me look like I’m trying to be Mr Tough Guy. I’m not.</p>
      <p>“We spoke with the players and I gave the list to Azpilicueta when we set out the fines. In fact I was asking him if there were any areas you see because I wanted to know what happened last year, whether the players were happy, were they not.</p>
      <p>“That came into the picture as well so it’s certainly a bit of a joint effort. Maybe the numbers were chosen by myself to a degree.</p>
      <p>“I do think discipline is an important thing and I’m very happy to work with the players.”</p>
      <p>Lampard believes his players are comfortable with the fines system, and insisted he will be happy to see good causes benefit.</p>
      <p>“I want to be successful; I expect them to look after each other on the pitch and when they train, so I expect them to respect each other in terms of turning up,” said Lampard.</p>
      <p>“If you talk about coming late to training, we arrive at 10 and we start training at 11.</p>
      <p>“If you’re late for training you’re effectively an hour and 15 minutes late without any excuse, that’s quite a big deal if you’re preparing for a game against Manchester City on the next day.</p>
      <p>“I know the fines are relative, people can have their own mind. But the players are certainly big in the setting up of that and I think it’s important to have discipline in the workplace.</p>
      <p>“The players were part of the process. I’m not here to be a dictator and make things difficult.</p>
      <p>“We’re here to be successful as a football club and discipline’s part of it and I worked with them in putting it together.</p>
      <p>“The fine money goes to charities and it said on the form about having certain team get-togethers. We haven’t had any of those yet.</p>
      <p>“Predominantly it will go to charities of our choice. I don’t mind as long as it’s good causes.”</p>
