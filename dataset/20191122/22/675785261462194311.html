      <h1>Prince Charles breaks off royal tour for 'stern words' with shamed Prince Andrew</h1>
      <h2>The Queen went horseriding with the Duke of York today to show she is standing by him - but Prince Charles is understood to have broken off from his tour to return home for “stern words”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:11:53+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:11</time> by <a rel="author">Russell Myers, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/russell-myers/</a></address>
      <p>The Queen showed her support for Prince Andrew by appearing in a stage-managed photo of them out riding.</p>
      <p>But more organisations pulled out of his projects following his disastrous TV interview.</p>
      <p>Royal insiders say it is increasingly likely that all the organisations he is patron of – over 175 – will ditch him.</p>
      <p>Prince Charles is understood to have broken off from his tour in New Zealand to return home to have “stern words” with his brother Andrew.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/royal-family">Royal Family</a> are bracing themselves for more devastation as it emerged Andrew’s sex accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre is set to release “fresh details” about her abuse at the hands of the prince’s pal, paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>And there is growing pressure from Epstein’s victims for the Duke to speak to the FBI which is investigating the sex scandal in the US.</p>
      <p>Humiliation was heaped on Andrew as Barclays – a major sponsor of his Pitch@Palace project – ditched him over the furore.</p>

      <p>The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the English National Ballet also announced his resignation as patron with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>But amid the damage being inflicted on the Royal Family by Andrew’s downfall, the Queen went riding with him to make it clear she is standing by him.</p>
      <p>Photographers captured them on horses in the grounds of Windsor Castle this afternoon, just 48 hours after she effectively sacked him at the behest of Prince Charles.</p>
      <p>Andrew was forced to make a grovelling apology to the Queen and Charles after the disastrous TV interview when the Duke spoke about his friendship with Epstein.</p>

      <p>A Buckingham Palace source said: “The Queen has told Andrew he has her support but it is clear his brother Charles will be having stern words with him when he gets home.</p>
      <p>“Her very public show of support is a clear indication she has forgiven him but he has been ordered to keep in line. The inquests have already begun inside the Palace.</p>
      <p>“Charles will demand to know how on earth this could have been allowed to happen, who was advising Andrew and why he was not consulted about his decision to go ahead with the interview.</p>
      <p>“He has been ordered to step back from royal life until he has unequivocally cleared his name or the Epstein case is over, which could be years. The road to redemption might not only be long, it could be completely blocked off.”</p>
      <p>Andrew announced on Wednesday he was stepping back from public life after the fury surr­ounding his interview when he described Epstein’s sick crimes as “unbecoming”.</p>

      <p>Virginia, now 35, who says she was Epstein’s sex slave and claims she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew, 59, three times when she was 17, has recorded an explosive interview with BBC Panorama which will air on December 2.</p>
      <p>Andrew has always strenuously denied ever having sexual contact with Virginia.</p>
      <p>With rumours swirling that Andrew was under mounting pressure to step down from his Pitch@Palace initiative – and with some officials trying to find other members of the family to take over from him – the Duke was still officially clinging on.</p>
      <p>Pitch@Palace allows Andrew to make money out of tech deals. He is entitled to a 2% share of any investment deal for three years from the Dragons’ Den-style programme.</p>
      <p>A Palace spokesman said: “The Duke will continue to work on Pitch and will look at how he takes this forward outside of his public duties, and outside of Buckingham Palace. We recognise there will be a period of time while this transition takes place.”</p>
      <p>A Pitch@Palace insider said: “The Duke is devastated at what has happened. It was his vision and he was the soul of Pitch but with his reputation in tatters the entire project’s future is in the balance.”</p>
      <p>Barclays said it was “regretfully” ending its support of Pitch@Palace.</p>

      <p>The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra confirmed Andrew would no longer be its figurehead, and he agreed to step down as English National Ballet patron after 18 years.</p>
      <p>His disgrace means he will lose access to taxpayer funds from the Sovereign Grant and will be forced to ask the Queen for handouts from her personal fortune.</p>
      <p>It has emerged that his downfall also threatens the Queen with a big tax bill.</p>
      <p>David McClure, author of Royal Legacy, an investigation into the House of Windsor’s finances, said the Queen would no longer be able to write off the estimated £1million-a-year cost of running the Duke’s office as a business expense as he no longer has an official royal role.</p>
      <p>Amanda Thirsk is stepping down as Andrew’s private secretary from January but will still work on ensuring a future for Pitch@Palace, sources say. She was blamed for pushing the Duke into giving the TV interview.</p>
      <p>Andrew’s remarks to Newsnight have been further called into question with the revelation he met Epstein’s ex-girlfriend and alleged madam Ghislaine Maxwell in London in June two weeks after US prosecutors announced they wanted to reopen their probe into Epstein. Ms Maxwell has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>Andrew said he is “willing to help any...law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required”.</p>
      <p>Epstein, 66, was found dead in his cell in August as he awaited trial on child sex trafficking charges.</p>
