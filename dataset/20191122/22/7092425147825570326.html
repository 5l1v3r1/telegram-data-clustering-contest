        <b>Joe Schmidt received a standing ovation as he appeared on The Late Late Show this evening.</b>
      </p>
      <p>His six years as Ireland manager came to a disastrous end in the World Cup as New Zealand hammered the Boys in Green in the quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>However, overall it was a huge success and Schmidt will go down as a legend of Irish rugby.</p>
      <p>He guided Ireland to three Six Nations titles, including a Grand Slam in 2018.</p>
      <p>Schmidt was granted Irish citizenship in 2015 while he was named World Rugby Coach of the Year in 2018.</p>
      <p>With all this in mind, it's hardly surprising that he was given such a warm reception tonight.</p>
      <p>People felt it was fully deserving and plenty rushed to praise him online, the New Zealander was described as "humble, "inspirational" and a "gentleman".</p>

      <p>Schmidt told Ryan Tubridy about his respect for the Irish supporters while he also revealed the underwhelming Six Nations campaign was partly due to the fact Ireland prioritised the World Cup.</p>
