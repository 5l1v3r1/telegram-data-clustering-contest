      <h1>Judge to consider conflicting stories about alleged hit and run</h1>
      <h2>"There's stuff that will never heal."</h2>

      <p>Conflicting stories about what happened to cause serious injuries to a 37-year-old pedestrian will be weighed as a judge determines whether to find a motorhome driver guilty of hit and run and dangerous driving causing bodily harm.</p>
      <p>Christopher Martyn, 49, was tried on the two charges at Regina Court of Queen’s Bench this week. Justice Darin Chow tentatively reserved decision to Feb. 26.</p>
      <p>Court heard from a variety of police and civilian witnesses — among them, Martyn and the complainant, Jared Perrault. While there was no dispute Perrault suffered serious injuries <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/pedestrian-treated-after-being-struck-by-motor-home-on-prince-of-wales-drive">after an impact with Martyn’s motorhome on the afternoon of Sept. 4, 2017</a>, testimony varied on what led to that point.</p>
      <p>According to Perrault, the incident began when he was cut off by Martyn’s motorhome while trying to cross Prince of Wales Drive on Eastgate Drive. He told the court he was forced up onto the curb, causing damage to his mother’s car.</p>
      <p>The motorhome kept going, and Perrault said he followed and attempted to get the driver’s attention. When the motorhome didn’t stop, he drove in front of it and braked. He said the motorhome pulled to a stop and Perrault got out of the car with his phone in hand to snap photos of the driver and the licence plate.</p>
      <p>Perrault said the driver backed up, then drove forward in his direction.</p>
      <p>“I remember the feeling of being hit,” he said, voice cracking. “I remember the feeling of my leg hitting the ground. I felt it snap.”</p>
      <p>Perrault said his next memory is of waking up in hospital. He said his leg was broken in two places and that he suffered broken bones in his face, brain bleeds and a fractured skull, bruised ribs and injuries to his shoulder, lower back and knee that continue to bother him.</p>
      <p>“There’s stuff that will never heal,” he said.</p>
      <p>While Martyn acknowledged he’d been driving the motorhome at the time, he said he didn’t know anything about a near-collision on Eastgate. Because of that, he told the court he had no idea why a driver braked suddenly in front of him on Prince of Wales.</p>
      <p>Martyn described the other driver as jumping out in a rage and coming at him with something in his hands. Martyn told the court he was concerned the other man was on drugs or “crazy,” and that he wanted to avoid a confrontation when he reversed away.</p>
      <p>Martyn testified Perrault effectively caused his own injuries.</p>
      <p>“He just dashed over and jumped on the hood of the motorhome,” he said.</p>
      <p>He testified Perrault’s hip struck the front hood area, but said it looked no worse than a “tap.”</p>
      <p>Martyn told the court he was “stunned” and had turned onto Victoria Avenue before his head cleared and he realized he needed to go back.</p>
      <p>“That was the right thing to do so that’s what I did,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said he had trouble finding a good place to turn around and, by the time he got back to Prince of Wales, a police vehicle was behind him with lights on.</p>
      <p>Martyn’s criminal history includes a 1991 vehicle-related manslaughter in which an Oxbow garage owner was run down during an altercation.</p>
