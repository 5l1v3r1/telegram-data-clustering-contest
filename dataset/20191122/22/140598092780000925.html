      <p>Pep Guardiola has insisted there is no chance of him quitting as Manchester City manager at the end of the season, even if his side surrender the Premier League title to an <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/liverpool-might-unstoppable-season-rivals-rebuilding-back/">“almost unstoppable” Liverpool</a>.</p>
      <p>Talk has surfaced in recent weeks that Guardiola could step aside at the end of his fourth season in charge of City.</p>
      <p>But he moved to quash the rumours about his future on Friday night by stressing that he will see out his contract with the champions, which runs until June 2021, and even appeared to hint at staying beyond that.</p>
      <p>Guardiola has never stayed at a club longer than the four years he spent in charge of Barcelona and has been linked with a move to Juventus.</p>
      <p>Yet he said he would embrace the challenge of trying to topple Liverpool should City lose their crown this term, despite scoffing at the idea that the title race is already a foregone conclusion.</p>

      <p>“If people ask, ‘Do I want to stay?’ I want to stay, I don’t have any reasons to move from here,” Guardiola said. “I am incredibly satisfied to work with this club, with these players, and if people think I am going to resign or be sacked for these results and being nine points behind, then people don’t know me.</p>
      <p>“I like to be in this challenge, I love to be in this position. And if the club wants [me] next season, I want to be here 100 per cent.</p>
      <p>“I want to live in this city because I know lovely people here and I want to work and live with them. If they [the club] decide the results are getting worse, they are going to take a decision, that’s normal, it’s not because I am friends with Txiki [Begiristain, City’s director of football] that I am going to stay for the rest of my life.</p>
      <p>“I am here because I win. If I don’t win, I’m in trouble, but I’m incredibly satisfied to work in this city and this club and I want to help this club to get better. I still enjoy working with these players a lot and I would like to stay longer. If the club wants, I will stay.</p>
      <p>“Why should people think I’m not happy here? Because we lost at Anfield or I’ve lost three games this season? That’s an odd reason to say I’m not happy or satisfied to be here.</p>
      <p>“The moment I will leave is when I feel my team don’t follow [me] to play at Anfield in the way we played. At that moment I’d say, ‘Wow, I miss my team’ and after I would call my boss and say, ‘Guys, maybe you have to sit and think about it’. But I don’t have that feeling. If it’s not enough [this season], next season will be better.”</p>
      <p>Ederson will return against Chelsea after the City goalkeeper missed the Liverpool game with a thigh injury and Guardiola recognises that the champions have little margin for error between now and May, even if he feels talk of the title race being over is wildly premature.</p>
      <p>“I know from all around the world the Premier League is done, so if that happens we’ll try again next season, and my players will be there,” he said. “We have two options – give up or don’t give up. I think the way we played at Anfield especially, we are not going to give up.</p>
      <p>“I have a feeling we are not far away from how we played in the last seasons but we have a team that is almost unstoppable and in incredible top form [in Liverpool]. They are the champions of Europe but we’re in November.</p>
      <p>“I know that to be there until the end we have to go on an incredible run of games but I think it will be a big mistake if you think too far ahead.</p>
      <p>“Honestly, I need to live these situations, I need to prove myself, and my players  have to prove themselves. Why not fight again and try to improve and do it again? That’s the only way to get better.  I never thought we were unstoppable. I think we are incredible but the target is still to show how good we are.”</p>
