      <h1>Diane Lane, Piper Perabo Arrested While Protesting Climate Change with Jane Fonda</h1>
      <h2>Actresses Diane Lane and Piper Perabo were arrested on Friday while protesting with Jane Fonda, who has been <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/01/watch-jane-fonda-arrested-again-with-rosanna-arquette-at-climate-change-protest/">repeatedly</a> getting herself arrested in Washington, D.C. protesting climate change.</h2>

      <p>The Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C. saw a few more celebrity arrests on Friday, as actresses Diane Lane and Piper Perabo were detained by police during their climate change protest alongside Jane Fonda, dubbed, “Fire Drill Friday.”</p>
      <p>“I was just arrested at [Fire Drill Friday] because we are in a climate emergency, and we need our government to protect our land, air, and water from big oil’s pollution,” tweeted Perabo along with photos herself being arrested.</p>

      <p>“Honored to stand with [Jane Fonda] and so many inspiring youth climate activists,” added the actress.</p>
      <p>Friday made for Fonda’s seventh political demonstration in a row. The <i><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/diane-lane-piper-perabo-arrested-protesting-jane-fonda-1256880">Hollywood Reporter</a></i> noted that Fonda had avoided getting herself arrested this time around, as she faces “a lengthy jail stay with each additional infraction for her previous arrests.”</p>
      <p>The Netflix sitcom star has already spent one night in jail after being arrested four times.</p>
      <p>The report added that Fonda’s attorney said earlier this week that the D.C. Attorney General’s office has decided not to charge the actress for her previous arrests.</p>
      <p>“Today’s 40 organizers, indigenous leaders, and activists along with celebrities like [Piper Perabo], [Amber Valletta], and Diane Lane were arrested to make it clear: WATER CAN’T WAIT,” said the “<a href="https://twitter.com/FireDrillFriday/status/1197930580790435842?s=20">Fire Drill Fridays</a>” Twitter account.</p>

      <p>Last week, actresses June Diane Raphael and Marg Helgenberger, as well as Robert Kennedy Jr. joined Fonda for a <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/16/jane-fonda-storms-senate-building-during-climate-change-protest/">sit-in</a> at the U.S. Capitol building, where the three of them also got themselves arrested, along with other protesters.</p>
