      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/ozzy-osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> has taken to the stage for the first time this year with a surprise appearance at a <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/post-malone">Post Malone</a> concert in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/listen-ozzy-osbournes-new-surprise-track-featuring-slash-straight-hell-2570693">‘Straight To Hell’</a> singer, 70, is <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-make-live-comeback-post-malone-travis-scott-american-music-awards-2569290">set to join Posty and Travis Scott onstage at the American Music Awards this Sunday (November 24) for a performance of the trio’s collaboration ‘Take What You Want’</a>. But it seems Ozzy and Malone pair couldn’t wait for the weekend: Ozzy joined the star on stage for a surprise performance at The Forum last night (November 21).</p>
      <p>In the fan-filmed footage below, fans can be heard screaming as it becomes apparent that Ozzy is there to support Posty <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/post-malone-reveals-ozzy-osbourne-collaboration-came-2545878">on the track</a> taken from the latter’s 2019 album <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/post-malone-hollywoods-bleeding-2545454">‘Hollywood’s Bleeding’</a>. Watch below.</p>

      <p>The images are likely to be welcomed by Ozzy’s fans, following a difficult year in which the veteran rocker suffered several health set backs.</p>
      <p>In April, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-postpones-tour-dates-suffering-fall-2471491">the former Black Sabbath frontman was forced to postpone the second year of his two-year farewell tour due to injuries sustained from a fall</a>. Two month prior to this, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-treated-intensive-care-pneumonia-fears-2445877">he was hospitalised with pneumonia following a severe bout of flu</a>.</p>

      <p>Post Malone’s new album features the Prince of Darkness himself, Ozzy Osbourne</p>
      <p>Earlier this week Ozzy released a new track that features <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/guns-n-roses">Guns N’ Roses</a> guitarist <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/slash">Slash</a>, called: <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-treated-intensive-care-pneumonia-fears-2445877">‘Straight to Hell’</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s the second song to be taken from Ozzy’s upcoming album, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-release-new-album-january-says-sharon-osbourne-2562105">‘Ordinary Man’</a>, which is due out early next year.</p>
