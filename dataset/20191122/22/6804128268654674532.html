      <h2>The former Spurs midfielder has been speaking about Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham and Manchester United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:09:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:09</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Former Tottenham star Chris Waddle has made a Manchester United related claim about <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/mauricio-pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a>.</p>
      <p>The Argentine parted ways with <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Spurs</a> after five years this week and was replaced by <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a>, with the club sat 14th in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>This comes on the back of four top-four finishes in succession for Tottenham and a Champions League final appearance in June.</p>
      <p>However, club chairman Daniel Levy ultimately made the 'reluctant' decision to sack Pochettino but Waddle believes the 47-year-old could be destined for the United job sooner rather than later with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer under pressure at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>"Mauricio Pochettino won’t be out of work for long and there’s a game at Bramall Lane this weekend which could be massive for his future," Waddle told the Racing Post.</p>
      <p>"Sheffield United take on Manchester United in a game which has far bigger implications than just the three points. United have never made any secret of the fact that they wanted Pochettino and he’s now suddenly available.</p>
      <p>"Their problem is that under Solskjaer, United are showing signs of turning a corner. Dan James is blossoming, Scott McTominay and Marcus Rashford are starting to dominate games and Nemanja Matic is fit again. Things are looking up for Solskjaer – or they were until Spurs sacked Pochettino.</p>

      <p>"Defeat at Sheffield United on Sunday suddenly ratchets up the pressure on Solskjaer, there will be a feeding frenzy from the media, and it will be interesting to see if United’s board reacts. United wouldn’t be alone in wanting Pochettino. Bayern Munich have to be tempted, he has links with Paris Saint-Germain and obviously there’s the lure of Spain."</p>
