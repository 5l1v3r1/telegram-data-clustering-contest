      <p>Coinciding with the release of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/avengers-4/">Avengers: Endgame</a>'s art book, one of the film's concept artists, Ryan Meinerding, has offered fans a glimpse at an unused design for the Quantum Suits worn by Earth's Mightiest Heroes.</p>
      <p>Meinerding -- Marvel Studios' Head of Visual Development -- shared the images on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5JVu5Opgt1/">Instagram</a>. "Unused Time Suit design from <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>!" he wrote. "The awesome final design was a collaboration between [Aleksi Briclot] and [Wesley Burt]!" One of the more apparent features from this early rendition is the blue holographic aesthetic that's accented with a black paint job.</p>

      <p>From the looks of it, this version seems to have been heavily inspired by the spacesuits worn by the Guardians of the Galaxy. Not only does this version feature a more prominent design influence from Marvel's intergalactic heroes, but the chest plate's integrated Arc Reactor reveals that the suits are powered by Tony Stark's signature technology.</p>
      <p>Directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> stars Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Brie Larson as Captain Marvel, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, Don Cheadle as War Machine, Karen Gillan as Nebula, Danai Gurira as Okoye and Bradley Cooper as Rocket, with Gwyneth Paltrow Pepper Potts, Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan, Benedict Wong as Wong, Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie and Josh Brolin as Thanos. The film is now available on Digital HD, Blu-ray and 4K UHD.</p>
