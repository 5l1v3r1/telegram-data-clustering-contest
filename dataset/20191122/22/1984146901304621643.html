      <p>Ben Dawson believes his side will gain some much-needed experience from their opening Premier League International Cup clash of the season against Benfica.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">The Magpies</a> were held to a 1-1 draw against the Portuguese side at Whitley Park on a night which Ludwig Francillette netted his first goal for the club.</p>
      <p>Dawson felt the young Magpies done enough in the game to take three points out of their group game, and emerged afterwards to tell Chronicle Live: "I look back at the great example this summer where four or five lads from the Under-23s went out to China for the Premier League Trophy with the first team.</p>
      <p>"They grasped the chance.</p>
      <p>"We have also played in the Hong Kong 7s tournament so it helps you then go on to deal with different opponents.</p>
      <p>"There's other things like travelling and the quick turnaround and then playing.</p>
      <p>"The lads had a different experience again to two years ago in this competition.</p>

      <p>"Back then we had Sparta Prague who travelled here and just sat back.</p>
      <p>"That was totally different to whatever the lads experienced but they might need it at some point.</p>
      <p>"It's all valuable for them."</p>
      <p>Dawson has taken on the responsibility of selection and tactics since the departure of Neil Redfearn earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Looking back on the game Dawson said: "A bit of a mixture really, I was pleased with the lads' effort and application.</p>
      <p>"I am disappointed we haven't made the most of it and taken three points to be honest.</p>
      <p>"We probably do feel fortunate that Jake Turner made a great save at the end to keep it at 1-1.</p>
      <p>"But in general terms we did enough to just about edge it.</p>
      <p>"We need to tighten up on some bits in the attacking half to create more opportunities and chances.</p>
      <p>"Although, I am pleased with how we dealt with a strong international opponents.</p>
      <p>"I can't grumble too much."</p>
      <p>Francillette's goal is further evidence that the 6ft 4in defender is settling in by the day on Tyneside.</p>
      <p>Dawson said: "He is a real threat as you can imagine with the size of him.</p>
      <p>"With any set-play, no matter what the set-up or what the opponent, if there is a good enough delivery, if you've got somebody willing to put their head on it.</p>
      <p>"He was and it was a great finish.</p>
      <p>"I just wish we could do that a bit more often."</p>
