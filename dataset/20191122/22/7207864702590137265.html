      <p>Billionaire and 2020 presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg has begun booking “massive” amounts of television ad time across the country as he ramps up his bid to become the Democratic nominee.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg has booked ad time in several media markets that will begin to air as early as Monday, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/22/michael-bloomberg-ad-buy-2020-election-072893">Politico reports</a>. Stations across the country have reported that <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/11/18/liberals-bloomberg-stop-and-frisk-apology/">Bloomberg</a> has bought <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/10/22/democrat-donors-michelle-obama-clinton/">ad</a> time, including stations in Mankato, Minnesota, Tallahassee, Florida, Pueblo, Colorado, and Sacramento, California, the publication reports.</p>
      <p>“This buy is MASSIVE,” said Advertising Analytics analyst Ben Taber in an email to Politico “We’ve only seen a few one-off stations but it looks like the buy is going to be at least $10 [million] for one week. Possibly way more.”</p>

Amandi also worked for former President Barack Obama’s campaigns.</p>
