      <p>Neymar had a "bad performance" on his return for Paris Saint-Germain, according to coach Thomas Tuchel, who nonetheless defended the fit-again forward.</p>
      <p>The Brazil star had been out of action for a month with an injury sustained on international duty but started for PSG at home to Lille in Ligue 1 on Friday.</p>
      <p>Neymar had a hand in PSG's second goal in a 2-0 win that moved the champions 11 points clear at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>However, in his 65 minutes on the pitch, he failed to record a single shot or key pass and completed only 63.9 per cent of his passes on an underwhelming return to action.</p>
      <p>Tuchel, though, was not expecting a top performance given his time on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>"No, I'm not worried by his bad performance," Tuchel told reporters of Neymar's display. "I do not know if it's normal.</p>
      <p>"I did not expect much from him because he missed six weeks. It's a lot for someone like him, who needs pace for everything he does.</p>
      <p>"He missed precision today, timing. But it's like that. He had to play a few minutes."</p>

      <p>Neymar was replaced by Kylian Mbappe and went straight down the tunnel rather than watch the rest of the game from the bench.</p>
      <p>"It's normal. Many players enter the locker room directly," was Tuchel's view.</p>
      <p>"I did not see that because I was focused on the game, changing tactics.</p>
      <p>"We have to talk about this thing internally. But we are not going to talk about it too much now."</p>

      <p>Goals from Mauro Icardi and Angel Di Maria in the first half saw PSG to a routine victory at Parc des Princes.</p>
      <p>"They are fit, and strong together," Tuchel said of the Argentina duo. "Both stayed with us during the [international] break.</p>
      <p>"That's good because you can manage them and keep them fresh. Both are decisive and score goals. And they work for the team and it makes a huge difference for us."</p>
