      <p>Frustrating!</p>
      <p>That's the best way to describe the mood around the West Kelowna Warriors these days.</p>
      <p>Frustration at not being able to score, frustration at always having to chase the game from behind, frustration at not getting a call, frustration at not being able to get a win when you might deserve a better fate.</p>
      <p>The Warriors established a dubious franchise record Friday night, dropping their 10th in a row - a 5-1 defeat at the hands of the Wenatchee Wild.</p>
      <p>And, it came on their first game back before the hometown faithful after nearly a month, and seven straight games away from Royal LePage Place.</p>
      <p>"I thought we competed. I thought we showed some character and some resilience," said head coach Brandon West.</p>
      <p>"We lose a top guy in Trevor Adams (upper body) during the game, we lose a top guy in Brandon Dent during the first five minutes of the game. It's hard to recover...it's frustrating to kill those penalties."</p>
      <p>As has been the case in each of their previous nine losses during this long streak, the Warriors gave up the first goal. Matt Dorsey banged home a rebound on Wenatchee's third power play of the period with just 90 seconds left on the clock.</p>
      <p>Harrison Scott doubled the lead 24 seconds into the second, deflecting home a shot from the right wing.</p>
      <p>Tyler Young made it 3-0 five minutes later on another power play before Tanner Main got a cheap one off a Warrior skate to up the lead to four.</p>
      <p>The Warriors finally got one back when Deegan Mofford scored his first career BCHL goal with a hard wrist shot from the left circle on a two-on-one break.</p>
      <p>The Warriors came close to getting back into it, but newcomer Tyler Cristall rang a shot of the post with 12 minutes still left in the third.</p>
      <p>It was one of a handful of chances the Warriors had, but were unable to capitalize on. A common theme during their 10-game slide.</p>
      <p>West says it's no secret, the Warriors are creating good scoring chances, but are struggling mightily to finish them off.</p>
      <p>"Wednesday night we outchance a team, last Saturday we outchanceÂ  team and we fall on the wrong side of the scoreboard both of those nights.</p>
      <p>"Our chances for and against are either on par...we haven't been outchanced a lot in this skid, but we have to find ways to score goals."</p>
      <p>During this losing streak, not only have the Warriors given up the first goal in each game, they have never held the lead in any of those 10 contests.</p>
      <p>The Warriors went 0-3 with the man advantage, as that part of their game also struggled. Wenatchee was 2-7, with all seven chances coming during the first 40 minutes.</p>
      <p>Things won't be any easier Saturday when they host the Salmon Arm Silverbacks, minus Adams who will; miss at least the next game due to injury.</p>
      <p>The current slide has also allowed the Merritt Centennials to creep ahead in the standings. The Centennials doubled Prince George 4-2 to move two points up on the Warriors and out of the Interior Division basement.</p>
      <p>Saturday's game between the Warriors and Silverbacks gets underway at 6 p.m. at Royal LePage Place.</p>
