      <h1>Miami at FIU: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:25:14+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://thespun.com/miami-fl">Miami</a> doesn’t need to go too far for its road game this weekend for the second-to-last game of the season. The Hurricanes are heading across today for a date with the FIU Panthers.</p>
      <p>The ‘Canes have been a bit up-and-down this year, but the team has responded very well to a rough home loss to a rebuilding Georgia Tech squad earlier in the year. After that game, Miami has won three straight, including blowout wins over rival Florida State and a surprisingly decent Louisville squad.</p>
      <p>At 6-4 (4-3), Miami is one game out of the ACC Coastal, though they are one of four teams that are somewhere between 5-2 and 4-3 in league play. The Coastal, as usual, is a bit of a mess, though Virginia has a half-game on any other team at 5-2 in ACC play.</p>
      <p>Butch Davis’ FIU team is 5-5 on the year, but has won four of its last six. When the Panthers lose, they really lose though. FIU’s only single-score loss came to Western Kentucky, and the last two losses to Middle Tennessee and FAU came by 33 and 30 points, respectively.</p>

      <p>Since 2006, these two Miami-based teams have faced off just three times. The ‘Canes are 3-0 in the series.</p>
      <p>Last year, Miami won 31-17 against its former head coach Butch Davis, who led The U from 1995-2000. He parlayed an 11-1 final season at Miami into the Cleveland Browns head coaching job, and was 51-20 with three Big East titles in six seasons. The year after Davis left, Miami’s historic 2001 team won a national title under first-year head coach Larry Coker.</p>
      <p>After this game, Miami finishes its season at Duke, while FIU is at Marshall. Assuming they won’t upset the ‘Canes, the Panthers will need that game to reach bowl eligibility.</p>
