      <h1>Chelsea's Izzy Brown explains what he learnt from Marcelo Bielsa and why he didn't play at Leeds</h1>
      <h2>The attacking midfielder, on loan at Luton, comes up against his former club this weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Alan Smith</a></address>
      <p>Last season was the hardest of Izzy Brown’s career. On loan at Leeds United and just back from a torn cruciate ligament injury that had zapped his confidence, he was nowhere near the first-team plans.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow, the Chelsea attacking midfielder who now finds himself on loan at Luton Town faces the Elland Road club in his best shape for more than two years and with a point to prove.</p>
      <p>Actually, he is on the way to proving it already. Marcelo Bielsa, the eccentric Leeds head coach, has since said it was a mistake not to use Brown as his team threw away an automatic promotion place and collapsed in the play-off semi-final against Frank Lampard’s Derby County.</p>
      <p>“I was just coming back from a ACL injury and that was probably the toughest year of my life and when I came back I had it in my mind that I just wanted to play football again because I missed it so much,” Brown said.</p>
      <p>“Going to Leeds I thought would be a great decision. I feel like I learnt a lot but the main reason I went there was to play and that didn’t really happen. I’ve got a lot of respect for the club and the medical staff because they got me where I am now but I think this season I needed to play football 100 per cent, that’s all I was focused on.</p>
      <p>“When Luton came up I thought that’s the perfect fit for me because I felt I needed to just get a run of games which I haven’t had for a few years. The other day I started three games in one week for the first time in two years. I feel like I have come on so much since I have been here and I have been week fitter every game. I had a little set-back last week but that has all cleared up now and I am ready to go again.”</p>
      <p>There are no hard feelings towards Leeds or Bielsa and Brown still managed to learn a lot from the coach who is idolised by Mauricio Pochettino among others.</p>
      <p>“He has a completely different method to what every other coach has,” Brown said. “He sees football completely different. It was a great experience for me to actually work under him because he is respected throughout the world for being one of the best managers. His training is tough and I wouldn’t say it is boring but it is very repetitive and you do the same things every day. The same drills.</p>
      <p>“You watch the clips in the games and you say ‘that’s exactly what we did in training’ and they just do it on the pitch. He puts it into your brain and the players do it for him. You can see it gets results.”</p>
      <p>However, he does not feel there will be many tips he can pass on to his Luton team-mates before Saturday’s game at Kenilworth Road.</p>
      <p>“It’s difficult because the way he trains and the way they play matches is so intense. If you want to match that up then you have to be as fit as them. I have never seen teams train the way they train at Leeds.</p>
      <p>"It would be tough to match them because of how fit they are so maybe we will have to change our game plan to deal with the way they play but you know how they play and we know how we can play so we have to be focused on that game.</p>
      <p>“He is a great manager, very different and some players warm to that and some players don’t. if you don’t warm to it you can feel it because if you aren’t giving 100 per cent on the training pitch, you won’t play. If you are over your weight target, you won’t play.</p>
      <p>“It’s very precise with numbers but all of the staff know what he wants. And even if the staff don’t give him what he wants, he will tell them. He’s not afraid to tell people off. He’s a good man though.”</p>
      <p>Brown also spoke of his delight at seeing his close friends Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori succeeding for Chelsea’s first team.</p>
      <p>“Me, Tammy and Fikayo are close friends and we basically grew up together, we were all [born in] 97. We played at England together.</p>
      <p>"It’s great to see as everyone used to think Chelsea don’t bring through young players but now Lampard is in charge you are starting to see those players coming through, playing well and Chelsea are winning games so you can’t question that those players are not good enough because they are going out every day and performing.”</p>
