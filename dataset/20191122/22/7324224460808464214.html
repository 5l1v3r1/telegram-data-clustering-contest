      <h2>Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo is not worried that Joao Moutinho is still yet to have signed a new contract, insisting: “Everything is OK.”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joe-edwards/" target="_blank">Joe Edwards</a></address>
      <p>The 33-year-old midfielder, whose deal expires at the end of the season, was thought to be in advanced talks over fresh terms.</p>
      <p>The matter has since gone quiet, but Nuno said on the man who won Euro 2016 with Portugal: “Moutinho is here.</p>
      <p>“When something is official, for sure you will know. But everything is OK.”</p>
      <p>Moutinho has been a revelation since arriving from Monaco for £5million in the summer of 2018.</p>
      <p>He has continued to be a regular starter this season – starting 11 of the 12 Premier League games for Wolves, who are playing at Bournemouth tomorrow.</p>
      <p>On if Moutinho will be tied down soon, Nuno said: “I hope so. I think everything has its time.</p>
      <p>“There is a moment of discussion and a moment of understanding.</p>
      <p>“Everything is natural.”</p>
      <p>And Nuno had a similar response when asked if Wolves have firm plans in place for the transfer window in January.</p>
      <p>“Everything will take its natural course and things will happen naturally,” he said.</p>
      <p>Fans would like to see some fresh faces in the new year to bolster Wolves’ small squad.</p>
      <p>A fair few of the group have just returned from international duty, and Nuno added: “We’re pleased with all the players that went away during the international break.</p>
      <p>"I think it was very important for them as they had competition.</p>
      <p>“If you have a time to compete for your country and return healthy, you are ready to go.”</p>
