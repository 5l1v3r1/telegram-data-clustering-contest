      <p>"The support vehicle was simply transporting food and water for military personnel to distant positions. No one expected such a despicable act of employing such a powerful weapon in a peaceful village, where only civilians live," said one of the Ukrainian troops.</p>
      <p>He added that the missile was launched from about 2.5 km and, while the enemy operator was aiming at the cabin, the missile hit the trunk.</p>
      <p>"Three servicemen were shell-shocked. One of them is a female soldier. Now they are being treated at a military hospital. Their health condition is satisfactory," the headquarters said.</p>
