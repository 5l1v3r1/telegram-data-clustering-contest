      <h1>Oregon at Arizona State: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:05:22+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-12">No. 6 Oregon</a> carries the weight of the Pac-12’s College Football Playoff hopes on its shoulders. The Ducks have won nine straight since losing to Auburn in Week 1. Now, they’re in a prime position to win the conference and potentially earn the No. 4 seed in the CFP.</p>
      <p>Arizona State is one of two teams currently standing in Oregon’s way. ASU head coach Herm Edwards would love nothing more than to knock off the Ducks on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Sun Devils had a fantastic start to the season, going 5-1 with a notable win over Michigan State in Week 2. But Arizona State has collapsed, losing its last four games including a loss to Oregon State last weekend. The Sun Devils look to end the four-game losing streak on Saturday against the Ducks.</p>
