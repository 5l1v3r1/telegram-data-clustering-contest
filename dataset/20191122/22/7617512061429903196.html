      <h1>Parity name of the game in VISL's top division</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:01:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:01</time> by <a rel="author">Cleve Dheensaw</a></address>
      <p>Parity in the name of soccer.</p>
      <p>That could be the calling card for this season as only three points separate the top five teams in the Vancouver Island Soccer League Div. 1 table.</p>
      <p>Teams had played 10 of their 18 regular-season games heading into Friday night’s late-finishing game at Braefoot Park between host Lakehill and Cowichan FC. The exception among the leading group is Westcastle United, which has played nine games.</p>
      <p>Heading into Friday’s fixture, Lakehill had 21 points, Gorge FC 20, Westcastle United and Cowichan FC on 19 and Bays United 18.</p>
      <p>Former VISL stars such as World Cup players George Pakos, Jamie Lowery, Ian Bridge, other multi-capped Canadian national teamers Bob Bolitho, Ike MacKay, Brian Robinson and former pros Dallas Moen, Iain Baird, Frank Woods, Drew Ferguson and Tyler Hughes have provided marvellous storylines over the years. But few in quite as jumbled a bunching as this season’s table.</p>
      <p>“I don’t recall it being so tight for many, many seasons,” said VISL executive-director Vince Greco.</p>
      <p>“There’s usually one or two teams at the top of the table that really separate themselves from the pack each season. But there is a crazy amount of parity this season with some shocking results that have been recorded. Westcastle United might have a little bit of an edge with a game in hand and easier schedule to end. But it’s really up for anyone to take this season.”</p>
      <p>The mid-table has Vic West on 15 points, Juan de Fuca 10 and Powell River seven. Sitting in the relegation positions are Nanaimo United with five points and Mid-Isle with zero points.</p>
      <p>Hungrily eyeing those two possible vacated Div. 1 relegation positions for next season are current VISL Div. 2 leaders Comox Valley United and Victoria Highlanders.</p>
      <p>Today’s feature VISL Div. 1 game is the Langford derby under the lights at 8 p.m. between Westcastle United and a Juan de Fuca squad Greco describes as “scrappy.” They both share Westhills Stadium so it’s an NFL New York Giants and Jets-type situation with no real home-field edge.</p>
      <p>In other games today, Bays United is at Forrest Field in Ladysmith to face Mid Isle at 6 p.m., Gorge FC is at Merle Logan Field to play Nanaimo United at 5 p.m. and Vic West is at Powell River at 1:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>The top four finishers in the VISL Div. 1 are guaranteed spots in the Province Cup tournament in the spring for the B.C. championship. The Island field in the Province Cup will also include the Jackson Cup champion and runner-up. The draw for the Jackson Cup, the VISL Div. 1-2 competition patterned on the FA Cup, will be held in January.</p>
      <p>Greco said candidates for VISL Div. 1 player of the year so far include Sean Young, Keenen Colley and goalkeeper Sachdev Grewal of Westcastle United, Blaze Roberts of Cowichan FC and the always-lurking veteran Golden Boot stalwart striker Paddy Nelson of Bays.</p>
