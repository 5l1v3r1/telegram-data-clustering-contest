      <p>Willox, 40, of Monkton, Ayrshire, also faces a charge of trying to defeat the ends of justice.</p>
      <p>Emma <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4385625/emma-faulds-kilmarnock-murder-family-break-silence-pain-body-woods/">vanished on April 28</a>, sparking a desperate search.</p>
      <p>Her <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4385625/emma-faulds-kilmarnock-murder-family-break-silence-pain-body-woods/">remains were found</a> in Galloway Forest on June 13.</p>
      <p>At her <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4439682/emma-faulds-funeral-today-kilmarnock-bright-colours/">funeral in July</a> Rev Cameron told the packed church Emma’s death was a “shock” to everyone who knew her.</p>
      <p>Parents Ian, 68, and Margaret, 69, heard her described as “inspirational” for her work with vulnerable kids.</p>
      <p>Last month, Emma's beloved dog Maverick died.</p>
      <p>She got the West Highland Terrier for the 30th birthday and they were inseparable.</p>
      <p>Maverick <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4441726/emma-faulds-funeral-murder-dog-kilmarnock/">even led her coffin from the church</a> in the arms of a weeping family friend.</p>
