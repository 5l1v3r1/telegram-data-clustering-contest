      <h1>Liverpool make decision on Mohamed Salah surgery amid injury problems</h1>
      <h2>The Reds' Egyptian forward has been struggling to shake off an ongoing ankle injury he sustained at the beginning of last month which he continues to aggravate</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">David Maddock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-maddock/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> have ruled out surgery for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mohamed-salah">Mo Salah</a> , despite lingering fears over a persistent ankle problem.</p>
      <p>The star striker has suffered continuing issues for six weeks after being crocked by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> ’s Hamza Choudhury back in early October.</p>
      <p>Salah has been barely able to train with the problem, and has instead been forced to undergo rehab during the week before playing.</p>
      <p>But manager Jurgen Klopp says the injury has simply been exacerbated by another bad tackle from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> ’s Fernandinho, and there has been little time for the player to recover.</p>
      <p>Asked if he needed an operation, he replied: “No. It is from the Leicester game. It was getting better and better and then…it is good but it was after the (City) game again, another tackle, it flared up again.</p>

      <p>“It is not serious but in the short period we have to let it settle it is always tight for the game. We will see. He trained completely yesterday, a full session, but we have to see how he reacted.”</p>
      <p>The ankle problem is not the only Salah headache for Klopp. He has also been hit with the shock news that the forward’s nation Egypt are ready to demand his release for next summer’s Olympics.</p>
      <p>They want to include Salah as one of three overage players each qualifying country is allowed in the football competition - and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> have no power to resist.</p>
      <p>Klopp admitted he had just learned about the issue - which could be a huge problem given his biggest star could miss the start of next season, with the tournament due to be played from July 22 to August 8.</p>
      <p>The Egyptian FA have indicated they WILL demand his release, and the Reds boss said: “I know this from an hour ago. I had no idea.</p>
      <p>“There are some problems I know in the future. I have to speak to Mo. I don’t know if I do it today, or whenever. “Do we know if we have to (release him)? I do not know that.”</p>
