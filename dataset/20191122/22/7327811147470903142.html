      <p>BEVERLY HILLS -- The Paley Center for Media honored five true television comedy legends: Norman Lear, Carl Reiner, Bob Newhart, Lily Tomlin and Carol Burnett.</p>
      <p>"It's all of us together and that really makes me happy," said Burnett.</p>
      <p>Burnett knows the power of the laughter. She's been creating it for most of her life.</p>
      <p>"It takes us away from some of the terrible things that are happening in the world today, even if it's just for a moment," said Burnett.</p>
      <p>At 90, Newhart still does stand up. He's also been a part of hundreds of hours of bringing laughter to television comedy.</p>
      <p>"It gets you past those moments, those dark moments," said Newhart. "And I think it's as important as breathing, I really do."</p>
      <p>Tomlin also has a long history on television purely she feels laughter is a powerful force.</p>
      <p>"Laughter is renewing. It gives you-it brings you back to reality and to hope and to something stabilizing," said Tomlin. "It makes you realize how fruitless it is to be stupid or harsh or ugly."</p>
      <p>Proceeds from this event will go to support the creation of The Paley Center's comedy collection, which will celebrate eight decades of comedic moments in television.</p>
