      <p>EastEnders confirmed it was over for good for Martin Fowler and wife Stacey, with a devastating bombshell in the latest episode of the BBC soap.</p>
      <p>Stacey was teased to be returning on Friday night to collect her and her kids' things, after her split from Martin.</p>
      <p>She'd been on the run with her husband ever since she left Phil Mitchell for dead in September, with his son Ben blackmailing Martin to work for him.</p>
      <p>Martin hoped Stacey would finally be able to return but Ben threatened to kill her if she did - leading to Martin pretending to cheat on her with ex Sonia to keep her away.</p>

      <p>Stacey was distraught by the split, and this week Martin decided to tell her the truth and bring her home.</p>
      <p>But on Friday he still couldn't get through to her on the phone, and was left reeling by a discovery.</p>
      <p>As he headed to Stacey's mum Jean's house, he found her packing together her daughter's things.</p>

      <p>It's then that mystery newcomer Jerome, played by actor Chris Charles, arrived and made a shocking announcement.</p>
      <p>He came to collect Stacey's belongings without her, before saying he was her "friend".</p>
      <p>Martin quickly realised that Stacey had moved on though and had a new fella, with him trying to attack him in the Street.</p>

      <p>Jerome told him: "Me and Stacey are only early days.</p>
      <p>"I met Stacey on the school run. I saw how wrecked she was after your visit. Think what you like. I care about her, the kids are great."</p>
      <p>As Martin raged, he added: "Now I get why Stacey couldn'tâ€™t face coming."</p>
      <p>Stacey actress Lacey Turner is currently on maternity leave, while it's not known when she will return and if Jerome will be back with her.</p>
