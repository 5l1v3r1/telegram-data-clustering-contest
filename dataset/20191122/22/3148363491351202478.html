      <h1>Peggy Noonan: 'Trump's Defenders Have No Defense' | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>Pulitzer Prize-winning Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan declared Friday in her weekly column that “Trump’s Defenders Have No Defense.”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:31:42+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:31</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak, Joel B. Pollak</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-defenders-have-no-defense-11574382421">column</a>, which will appear in Saturday’s print edition, argues: “Almost everything in the impeachment hearings this week fleshed out and backed up the charge that President Trump muscled Ukraine for political gain.”</p>
      <p>She continues:</p>
      <blockquote>What was said consistently undermined Mr. Trump’s case, but more deadly was what has never been said. In the two months since Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry was under way and the two weeks since the Intelligence Committee’s public hearings began, no one, even in the White House, has said anything like, “He wouldn’t do that!” or “That would be so unlike him.” His best friends know he would do it and it’s exactly like him. … As to impeachment itself, the case has been so clearly made you wonder what exactly the Senate will be left doing. How will they hold a lengthy trial with a case this clear? Who exactly will be the president’s witnesses, those who’d testify he didn’t do what he appears to have done, and would never do it?</blockquote>
      <p>Noonan does not discuss the actual evidence presented, or the Constitution’s criteria for impeachment, but dwells on her impressions of the character of the witnesses — all of whom were selected or approved by Democrats.</p>
      <p>When she won the Pulitzer Prize in 2017 for her columns about the 2016 election, the <i>Journal</i> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/peggy-noonan-wins-2017-pulitzer-prize-for-commentary-1491860551">reported</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Ahead of most others, she foresaw Trump’s rise and his appeal to Americans who were frustrated by the leaders of both major political parties. Ms. Noonan didn’t shrink from addressing Trump’s many flaws as a candidate, but she always showed great respect for the intelligence of voters and explained the currents of American life and politics that catapulted Trump to the White House.</blockquote>
      <p>Noonan concludes her column by predicting: “Republican senators will call to let the people decide. In a divided country this is the right call. But they should take seriously the idea of censuring him for abuse of power.”</p>
