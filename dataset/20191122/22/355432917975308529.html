      <h1>Trump hints at softening of vaping flavor ban</h1>

      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> on Friday signaled he is walking back a long-delayed proposal to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from the market, amid concerns over job losses and the dangers of counterfeit products.</p>
      <p>Vaping and tobacco industry representatives and conservative groups clashed with patient advocates during a heated White House meeting, as Trump said he is worried about the effects of a complete flavor ban.</p>
      <p>“If you don't give it to them, it is going to come here illegally,” Trump said, adding “they could be selling something on a street corner that could be horrible.”</p>
      <p>Trump expressed support for the industry-backed proposal of raising the age limit for tobacco purchases to 21.</p>
      <p>“Twenty one, we are going to be doing,” Trump said.</p>
      <p>The “listening session” was called to help the White House enact a plan to combat a massive surge in teen vaping. New federal data shows that more than 5 million teens are now vaping, and many prefer flavored e-cigarettes.</p>
      <p>Two months ago, Trump and the administration’s top health officials sat in the Oval Office and announced their intent to clear the market of every flavor of e-cigarettes except for tobacco.</p>
      <p>At the time, Trump cited a massive spike in teen vaping and the spread of a mysterious vaping-linked illness that has now sickened more than 2,000 people across the country and resulted in nearly 50 deaths.</p>
      <p>But the administration has been sending mixed messages ever since, and multiple reports earlier this week said Trump spiked the ban after hearing about job losses from pro-vaping groups and his campaign advisers. Outside groups have also argued that flavors are necessary to help adults stop smoking traditional cigarettes. </p>
      <p>The meeting was the latest evidence that Trump could reverse course on his views from September, or at least soften his position to exempt menthol flavoring and independent vape shops.  </p>
      <p>In announcing the meeting, White House spokesman Judd Deere said the policymaking process was not dead, and Trump wanted to hear all sides.</p>
      <p>"This meeting will allow the President and other administration officials an opportunity to hear from a large group, representing all sides as we continue to develop responsible guidelines that protect the public health and the American people,” Deere said.</p>
      <p>Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/willard-mitt-romney">Mitt Romney</a> (R-Utah), who was seated next to Trump, repeatedly clashed with the pro-vaping representatives. </p>
      <p>At one point, Romney tried to point out that contrary to what vaping advocates argue, “most adults do not use flavors.” </p>
      <p>Industry representatives shouted back at him “yes they do," offering their own statistics about adult sales. </p>
      <p>In another exchange, Romney said the number of children who are getting addicted to nicotine because of e-cigarettes should far outweigh what any job losses. </p>
      <p>Romney said there are more than 100 kids who get addicted per every full-time employee in a small vape shop.</p>
      <p>“I put the kids first,” Romney said.</p>
