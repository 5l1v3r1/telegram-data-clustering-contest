      <p>(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/GS.N">GS.N</a>) said on Friday it has launched an internal campaign to promote awareness about pronouns and how employees self-identify.</p>
      <p>In a blog post <a href="https://bit.ly/35lHiJc,">bit.ly/35lHiJc,</a> Goldman listed "tips for being an inclusive ally", and advised that employees should not assume a colleague's pronoun or pronouns based on gender.</p>
      <p>The Wall Street bank said the campaign was meant to encourage workers to recognize and use colleagues’ self-identified pronoun or pronouns to “show respect and ensure a more inclusive environment.”</p>
      <p>“To enable our people to optimize their potential, we believe in fostering an inclusive environment where they feel comfortable to be their authentic selves,” the post said.</p>
