        <b>DERBY COUNTY have won their last four league games at Pride Park and they’re a huge price at 9/5 to beat high-flying Preston.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alex Neil’s second-top North End were on a major roll before the international break and fully deserve their lofty position in the Championship but Phillip Cocu’s home side are way better than their current 16th placing suggests.</p>

      <p>Preston arrive 6/4 favourites to make it four straight league wins and could top the table.</p>
      <p>That won’t be lost on the players or fans as they listen for leaders’ West Brom’s result against Sheffield Wednesday.</p>
      <p>That ambition may have to wait for another day though as County are in mean form on their own patch and were not disgraced at all in their most recent single goal defeat against biggest rivals Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>Cocu has had to deal with more off-field matters than he could have expected when he succeeded Frank Lampard but he’s shaping a side which could yet challenge for the play-offs and a 5-3-1 home record after this game will make that more likely.</p>

      <p>Preston are usually value for a goal which would require Derby to score twice but that’s built in to the 9/5 and Derby look more than capable of securing all three points.</p>
      <p>Michael O’Neill’s magic wand could be waved again as <b>STOKE</b> take on Wigan at 4/5 after the new boss’ debut win at Barnsley and I’ll take <b>WEST BROM</b> to stay top by beating Sheffield Wednesday at 10/11.</p>
      <p><b>NORTHAMPTON</b> are making stealthy progress in League Two under manager Keith Curle and The Cobblers look good for another three points at home against Grimsby.</p>
      <p>The seventh-placed side have won four of their last five league games and drawn the other away at Oldham and they are back at Sixfields after routing Crewe 4-1 last Saturday.</p>
      <p>They’re also in the next round of the FA Cup with a home tie against National League Notts County and former Carlisle boss Curle can guide them to another victory at what looks a value 19/20.</p>
      <p><b>PLYMOUTH</b> were worth their win at Forest Green Rovers last week despite my pre-match preference for the home side and Ryan Lowe’s improving Pilgrims can get another win at home to Bradford today.</p>
      <p>Gary Bowyer’s visitors travel south after playing at home in five of their last six games and Plymouth’s home form has been impressive enough to suggest they’re a good price at 6/5.</p>
      <p>There’s one lower league game in Scotland due to the latest round of the Scottish Cup and I strongly fancy <b>RAITH ROVERS</b> to be in the draw for the next round after their tie against Peterhead at Stark’s Park.</p>
      <p>John McGlynn’s players didn’t turn up when they lost 2-0 at Balmoor a couple of weeks ago but they have two verdicts over the Blue Toon at home already this season and there’s plenty to like about their unbeaten home form in League One.</p>
      <p>Auchinleck could find it tough to repeat their heroics from the last round at home to top five Championship side Arbroath but a draw could be the value at 4/1.</p>
      <p><b>DUMBARTON</b> look value to beat Forfar at 21/20 and I like the look of <b>EDINBURGH CITY</b> to beat Annan at 4/5 for a win treble with Dumbarton and Raith Raith at 9/2.</p>
      <p>IT’S a 4-1 split between England and Scotland with these picks paying 50/1.</p>
      <p>They are: Derby County (9/5), West Brom (10/11), Northampton (19/20), Plymouth (6/5), Hibs (5/4).</p>
      <p>RANGERS COLTS landed the bet for us last Saturday at 21/10 against Wrexham and I fancy in-form League One bottom dogs <b>BOLTON</b> to keep winning at Accrington at 5/2 and better.</p>

      <p>EVERYONE knows Celtic’s only league conquerors this season have been Livingston but Gary Holt’s side are the biggest priced team in Britain at 40/1 with Coral and Ladbrokes.</p>
      <p>Multiples backers will be doing well to get <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> at 1/8 but the champions do appear to be a 12 1/2 per cent top-up on recent form.</p>
      <p>There’s a small glimmer of hope for Livi by referencing Motherwell and St Mirren’s efforts to hold Celtic to 2-0 in Glasgow and anyone tempted by a defensive masterclass can avail themselves at up to 9/1 for the draw.</p>
      <p>I can’t see anything other than a home win though and Neil Lennon will have his side focused on winning and posing <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> yet another question on Sunday.</p>
      <p>ACCIES have home advantage but they’re still a huge price at up to 25/1 to cause an upset and I doubt there will be too many takers.</p>
      <p>Brian Rice has watched his team secure three draws in five matches since their 5-0 beating at Ibrox a few weeks ago and their most recent points against Killie and Ross County could have been wins.</p>
      <p>Rangers will regroup after the international break with their expectations at an all-time high under Steven Gerrard and the players have to remain focused before the League Cup Final two weeks tomorrow.</p>
      <p>There will no doubt be the usual grumblings about the Accies pitch but Rangers are 1/7 with most firms to win and I’d be amazed if they don’t.</p>
      <p>HEARTS are taking their time replacing Craig Levein but they banked three points with Austin MacPhee against St Mirren before the break and are more than capable of at least another.</p>
      <p>Killie are struggling for consistency but Rugby Park is proving difficult for anyone to get a victory and a 3-3-1 record so far is impressive.</p>
      <p>The hosts are 7/5 with most firms to win but Hearts are better than they’ve been showing and may have been under-rated at 21/10. I think the draw is safer at 11/5.</p>
      <p>I MADE Hibs the Saturday Single at 9/5 when they last played two weeks ago and they won 4-1 at Ross County after Paul Heckingbottom’s sacking earlier that week.</p>
      <p>Jack Ross takes charge for the first time here and I rate Hibs the value again at a general 5/4 with the new man given an ideal opportunity to get off to a winning start.</p>
      <p>Fourth-top Motherwell are no pushovers as they’ve proved at Celtic Park and Ibrox but Hibs haven’t been losing games and a change at the top seems to have worked already.</p>
      <p>Motherwell fans will delight at the general 21/10 but Ross can hit the ground running with an important three points in front of his new fans.</p>
      <p>THE DONS’ win at Ross County helped us land a 32/1 acca when they last played two weeks ago and I fancy them to make it four wins on the spin by winning at St Johnstone.</p>
      <p>Andrew Considine scored in that 3-1 victory and the club’s longest serving player can celebrate 500 appearances with another victory for his home club at a general 11/10.</p>
      <p>Saints looked to have turned a corner with home wins against Hamilton and Hearts but it was one step back against Hibs a fortnight ago in a 4-1 defeat.</p>
      <p>Aberdeen get a real chance to cement third place here with Motherwell away to Hibs and I’ll take the Dons to equal Rangers’ five away victories this season by taking all three points.</p>
      <p>SAINTS have three of their next four games at home and with all eight points gathered so far having been won in Paisley, this is a massive match for the Buddies ahead of Tuesday’s visit by Hibernian.</p>
      <p>Jim Goodwin and his side won their last home tie against St Johnstone and haven’t played badly of late on the road despite no points at Kilmarnock, Celtic and Hearts.</p>
      <p>It’s vital Saints score first but County have shipped 17 goals in their last five and this is an opportunity to back Saints at 5/4.</p>
      <p>NEWCASTLE landed the money for this column at 8/5 in their last match two weeks ago and they head for Villa Park on Monday night unbeaten in three league games since their 1-0 defeat at Chelsea.</p>
      <p>John McGinn will be back from his latest Scotland heroics for a Villa side with a 2-2-2 home record back and desperately unfortunate to have lost to league leaders Liverpool in their last home game.</p>
      <p>Villa look short at 21/20 with Newcastle on the up and the draw at 5/2 looks best.</p>
