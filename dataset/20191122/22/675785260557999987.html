      <h2>Manchester United might not be the dominant force that they were 10 years ago but Wilder still believes there is something special about them</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Bill Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Chris Wilder insists <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> will never lose their magic.</p>
      <p>The Old Trafford giants, by their own high standards, are having a bit of a hard time of it right now.</p>
      <p>But they make the trip across the Pennines to take on Sheffield United with Blades boss Wilder tipping them to remain the biggest draw in the business.</p>
      <p>He declared: “Manchester United are one of the most iconic teams in the world, and there will always be an aura surrounding them.</p>
      <p>“No matter how their fortunes on the pitch may fluctuate, it’s still one of football’s true powerhouses that we are talking about whenever we mention their name.</p>

      <p>“They are an incredible football club who are just going through a spell right now where they are not having it all their own way.</p>
      <p>“That happens in football. But fortunes can fluctuate very quickly in this game and they will find their way back to the top, that’s for certain.”</p>
      <p>Wilder says Harry Maguire will play a key role in the Old Trafford quest for fresh glory, and the England centre-back makes a sentimental return to Bramall Lane tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Sheffield-born Maguire launched his career at his home-town team before moving on to Hull and then becoming the world’s most expensive defender with his £80million switch from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> to United last summer.</p>
      <p>Wilder said: "Harry will get a great reception from our fans, I’m sure, and he can be proud of the way he has progressed and developed his game.</p>

      <p>“He was given his chance here by Danny Wilson, then established himself at Hull before doing fantastically well with Leicester and getting that move to United.</p>
      <p>“Harry has stayed humble, got on with his job, and we are all delighted for him that he’s getting the success he deserves.</p>
      <p>“He’s a Sheffield United boy and he still comes to watch us play when he can. But we don’t intend for this game to turn into the Harry Maguire show.</p>
      <p>“He’s in the opposition changing-room this time, so that means he is the enemy for 90 minutes. So it’s up to us to make it the Sheffield United show - and that’s what we want to do to make sure we stay where we are at the top end of the table.”</p>
