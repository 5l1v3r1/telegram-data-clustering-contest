      <h1>Ohio State vs. Penn State: An earlier game can help your wager</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:01:05+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:01</time> by <a rel="author">VSiN</a></address>
      <p>Is Ohio State going to roll over everyone until the Final Four?</p>
      <p>Betting markets are pricing that way. In Saturday’s much-hyped game matchups with Penn State (noon, Fox), the Buckeyes opened at -19. Sharps generally prefer underdogs in marquee matchups, and may wait to see how recreational bettors influence the line before kickoff.</p>
      <p>Penn State was supposed to be a tough test. But, so was Wisconsin, and that turned out to be a 38-7 blowout. The Badgers at least were able to slow down the Buckeyes a bit, holding them to 431 yards and 6.0 yards per play. That’s well below Ohio State’s season-to-date averages of 541.7 and 7.3.</p>
      <p>Penn State and Wisconsin have similar skill sets and are rated similarly in market perceptions. In fact, Circa Sports in Las Vegas, the only sportsbook to publicly release its team Power Ratings, has the Nittany Lions and Badgers tied at 12th in the nation.</p>
      <p>Does that mean Wisconsin-Ohio State is a good proxy for Penn State-Ohio State? It’s hard to find a better match! Same site. Same penchant for physical play. Same market power rating. Same ability to run up the score on outmatched opponents, but become mistake-prone when forced to pass (Penn State quarterback Sean Clifford threw three interceptions two Saturdays ago in a 31-26 loss at Minnesota).</p>
      <p>Ohio State can control its destiny in terms of scoreboard clearance. A point-spread cover at this high price may come down to how many cheap points the Buckeyes score off Nittany Lions miscues. If Penn State can play clean, it has a chance to stay within range. If not, expect another 38-7 type result.</p>
      <p>Ahead for Ohio State:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Buckeyes will be about 10-point favorites at Michigan next week according to Circa’s current ratings. That point spread could change based on this weekend’s results (or any unfortunate injuries). That Penn State-Michigan combo will provide the toughest two-week test Ohio State has faced this season.</li>
        <li>The Buckeyes will be big neutral-field favorites in the expected Big 10 title matchup against Wisconsin or Minnesota (who play each other next week). Circa currently projects those lines at -15 or -23, respectively, though a lot could change between now and then.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Victories put them in the Final Four, where seeding will determine degree of difficulty.</p>
      <p>Before you make plans to ride the Buckeyes through championship night, be aware that they may have weaknesses which haven’t been exposed yet. Ohio State’s only four games away from home came at Indiana, Nebraska, Northwestern and Rutgers.</p>
      <p>They haven’t dealt with a top-15 opponent in hostile territory (which will happen at Michigan). They haven’t dealt with the draining challenge of playing two top-15 opponents in consecutive weeks. And, they haven’t dealt with what might be a daunting sustained challenge of facing three Top-25 opponents in a row.</p>
      <p>If Penn State lands a few body blows Saturday, that could lead to somebody else’s knockout punch.</p>
