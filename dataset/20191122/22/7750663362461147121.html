      <h1>Result: Dan Evans puts GB in Davis Cup semi-finals</h1>
      <h2>A delighted <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dan-evans/"><b>Dan Evans</b></a> ended his losing run at the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/tennis/davis-cup/"><b>Davis Cup</b></a> finals in Madrid with victory over Jan-Lennard Struff to send Great Britain through to the semi-finals for the third time in five years.</h2>

      <p>Evans had lost his first two singles matches against Dutchman Robin Haase and Alexander Bublik of Kazakhstan from a set up but refused to accept the same fate against world number 35 Struff.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andy-murray/"><b>Andy Murray</b></a>, who was again left out of the side, cheering on from the sidelines, Evans withstood pressure in the third set to come through a deciding tie-break and win 7-6 (6) 4-6 7-6 (2).</p>

      <p>Coupled with another impressive win by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kyle-edmund/"><b>Kyle Edmund</b></a>, who defeated Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-3 7-5, Evans' victory was enough to seal the tie for Britain without the need for a deciding doubles rubber.</p>
      <p>Evans' place had been in question but captain Leon Smith stuck with him ahead of Murray and was rewarded with a display of real skill and heart from the 29-year-old.</p>
      <p>He dominated the deciding tie-break and, when Struff's final shot flew wide, Evans leapt high and threw his racket into the air before running to celebrate with Smith and the rest of the team.</p>
      <p>The 2015 champions will face either host nation Spain or Argentina on Saturday evening.</p>

      <p>This victory, though, means they are guaranteed to be back in Madrid next year, with semi-finalists exempted from March's play-off round.</p>
      <p>The only disappointment was the size of the crowd, which appeared noticeably smaller than for Britain's two group matches â€“ a concern Murray had raised ahead of the event.</p>
      <p>The British fans who had stayed made a good noise, though, and both Edmund and Evans responded in style.</p>
      <p>At 36, Kohlschreiber's best days may be behind him but he remains a dangerous customer, particularly off his one-handed backhand, and he has been in good form here.</p>

      <p>The German was a little wild in the first set against Edmund and the Yorkshireman took advantage, securing the only break of serve in the sixth game.</p>
      <p>The second was much tighter. Kohlschreiber became the first player this week to break the Edmund serve for 3-1 but a fine game from the 24-year-old reduced the arrears straight away.</p>
      <p>Edmund is known for his bulldozer forehand but it was his backhand doing a lot of the damage and another break for 6-5 set up a chance to serve for the match, which he took to love.</p>
