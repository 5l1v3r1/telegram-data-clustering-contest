      <h1>The 20 holiday destinations where property prices are set to boom</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:03:59+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/eblack/" target="_blank">Euan Black</a></address>
      <p>Another day, another forecaster tipping explosive growth in regional property markets.</p>
      <p>Hostpotting.com.au founder Terry Ryder last month told investors to <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/money/property/2019/10/04/top-10-property-investment/">abandon Sydney and Melbourne and invest in regional areas with plenty of infrastructure.</a></p>
      <p>And now it’s the turn of Select Residential Property (SRP) to talk up our regional markets.</p>
      <p>The research company has published a list of 20 regional suburbs where prices are set to increase more than 20 per cent over the next three years, and a small town near Byron Bay is leading the charge.</p>
      <p>SRP research director Jeremy Sheppard said the list is focused exclusively on holiday destinations, so that Aussies don’t make rash decisions during the upcoming holiday season.</p>
      <p>But holiday appeal isn’t the only thing going for them, with most laying claim to strong economies and large populations, too.</p>
      <p>“Investors go away on holiday around this time of year, and they get lured into buying in a location which may not have good capital growth prospects,” Mr Sheppard told <i>The New Daily</i>.</p>
      <p>“At the time they go there, during summer holidays, their eyes are wide open, they love the place, and they make an emotional purchase, rather than a numerical one.”</p>

      <p>East Ballina tops the list. It’s a coastal suburb 30km south of Byron Bay, with a population of 26,381.</p>
      <p>SRP is tipping prices there to lift 27.8 per cent over the next three years – thanks to its beautiful beaches and undersupplied housing market.</p>
      <p>The rest of the list is mostly made up of suburbs from NSW and Victoria  – though Tasmania and Queensland have snuck in three suburbs between them.</p>
      <p>Median house prices range from $297,000 in the regional hub of Mildura, on the Murray River, to $980,000 in North Avocoa, on the Central Coast.</p>

      <h3>How did they come up with the list?</h3>
      <p>The research company analysed <a href="https://dsrdata.com.au/stats/stats">17 different data points</a> to determine whether a suburb had an under or oversupply of housing, and naturally forecast greater growth for suburbs where demand exceeded supply.</p>
      <p>Everything from auction clearance rates to average vendor discounts and days on market were fed into the firm’s proprietary algorithm, which then gave each suburb a score out of 100.</p>
      <p>The more demand outstripped supply, the higher the score and greater the price growth.</p>
      <p>Even the number of open for inspections can provide insight into a suburb’s growth potential, Mr Sheppard said, with agents more inclined to encourage private inspections in cooler markets.</p>
      <p>But while other investors also keep an eye on population and job statistics, Mr Sheppard says these data sets can be misleading.</p>
      <p>“Jobs growth is important, but it’s not tremendously accurate at a suburb level. Typically jobs data is for a much larger area … and if jobs are driving demand for real estate, then it should show up in things like fast selling times and low discounting,” he said.</p>
      <p>“And when you drill down to a local government area, population growth is misleading – because the largest population growth you can get for a suburb is when it’s a greenfield site, and that just represents supply, which is the enemy of capital growth.”</p>
