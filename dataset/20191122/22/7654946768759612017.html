      <h1>Lawyer looks to shutter firm over partner’s alleged work affairs</h1>

      <p>A personal injury lawyer is asking a judge to sanction the shuttering of his firm after he claims his partner hit-on and had affairs with work secretaries, according to a new lawsuit.</p>
      <p>Kenneth Marder filed the Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit Friday against his partner of nine years Frank Eskesen who he says came on to three secretaries and had affairs with two others at their firm. At least four quit, the suit says.</p>
      <p>Marder — who <a href="https://www.men-law.com/">started Marder, Eskesen &amp; Nass</a> with Eskesen in 2010 — says he first caught wind of one of these illicit relationships in 2012 when a since- resigned secretary told Eskesen’s wife about their affair, the court papers allege.</p>
      <p>Marder confronted his partner who swore he wouldn’t have another work fling again, the court documents claim.</p>
      <p>The suit says that Eskesen “vowed that he would never again engage in any form of sexual improprieties or other sexual conduct with any employees of the partnership.”</p>
      <p>Marder continued to hear work rumors but gave Eskesen the benefit of the doubt until December 2018 when Marder was about to retire and another associate was looking to become a partner, the suit says.</p>
      <p>Eskesen had uploaded on a laptop for the associate materials about the company’s financials and also loaded naked photos of his most recent conquest at work — another secretary, the court papers say. The court papers didn’t clarify why Eskesen allegedly shared the racy images.</p>
      <p>As a result, the associate backed out of the deal and Marder is still seeking his $1.5 million buyout all while Eskesen has tanked the company including trying to open his own firm on the side, the lawsuit claims.</p>
      <p>Some of Eskesen’s other alleged behavior includes two Christmas parties at which he got drunk and frisky with female underlings, the filings say.</p>
      <p>In 2014, he allegedly acted inappropriately with an uninterested secretary who he tried to follow home on the train and in 2016 he held bonuses over two secretaries heads when asking them to join him at another bar, the court papers claim. All three women quit, according to the suit.</p>
      <p>Marder says in the suit that he wants to close up shop “because of the sexually predatory conduct of Defendant Frank Eskesen.”</p>
      <p>“Irreconcilable differences and extreme distrust of Eskesen exists because of Eskesen’s egregious conduct, making management of the Partnership impossible and dissolution, therefore, inevitable,” the court papers say.</p>
      <p>Eskesen did not immediately return requests for comment.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for Marder declined to comment.</p>
