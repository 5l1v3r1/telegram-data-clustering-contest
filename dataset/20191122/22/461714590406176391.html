      <p>A Labrador retriever had a dizzying adventure in a Florida cul-de-sac on Thursday after getting stuck in a car that that spun in circles like a dog chasing it’s own tail.</p>
      <p>Port St. Lucie police told <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/region-st-lucie-county/canine-joyride-port-st-lucie-dog-hits-car-into-reverse-drives-in-circles-for-nearly-an-hour">a NBC local affiliate</a> that the pooch’s owner stepped out of the car but left the engine running. Then the furry motorist, tempted with a good time, switched the gear to reverse.</p>
      <p>Neighborhood resident Anna Sabol only noticed the donut-driving doggo when the cop cars started showing up. “I laughed. I thought they should give that dog a license to drive,” Sabol told WPTV. “He was a better driver than a lot of them I’ve seen.”</p>

      <p>The cops stood around perplexed for a while, unsure how to stop the car.</p>
      <p>“He was doing pretty good until he hit the mailbox. He went around for about an hour without hitting anything at all,” Sabol added.</p>
      <p>That’s when the car slowed down and officers were able to type in the passcode to unlock the door. The dog escaped, uninjured.</p>
      <p>Sabol told the news outlet that she witnessed the good boy wagging its tail after the joyride.</p>
