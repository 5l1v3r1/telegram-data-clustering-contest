      <h1>QCFA holds meeting on Gagne, increasing inclusivity in public schools</h1>
      <h2>The top solution proposed to make public schools more inclusive was to defeat the trustees who voted against the Pride motion.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:22:57+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/lgiesbrechtpostmedia" target="_blank">Lynn Giesbrecht</a></address>
      <p>With the goal of making Regina’s public schools more inclusive, Queen City For All (QCFA) wants to educate people on how they can run for school board positions while continuing its efforts to see Katherine Gagne removed from her role as the division’s board chair.</p>
      <p>The community group QCFA formed in the wake of public backlash that erupted after the 4-3 defeat of <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/confusion-over-school-board-pride-motion-leads-to-tears-fears-and-calls-for-action">a motion brought forward to the Regina Public Schools board in October. The motion called for the school division to “recognize and support” Pride week and to fly the Pride flag for a week every June.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/gagne-apologizes-for-handling-of-pride-motion-handed-petition-calling-for-her-removal">Earlier this month, the group presented Gagne with a petition, calling for her removal as board chair, that had received more than 5,000 signatures.</a> Kent Peterson, a spokesperson for QCFA, said he is disappointed in the silence that has followed in the weeks since.</p>
      <p>“We heard nothing. Katherine Gagne did not indicate that she wasn’t going to resign, she didn’t indicate that she was going to resign,” said Peterson in an interview Friday.</p>
      <p>Katherine Gagne could not be reached for comment.</p>
      <p>QCFA held an open meeting Thursday evening to discuss issues Regina residents were seeing around inclusivity in the city’s public schools and what they could do to change this.</p>

      <p>With more than 50 people in attendance, Peterson said the top solution proposed to making public schools more inclusive was to defeat the trustees who voted against the Pride motion — including Gagne.</p>
      <p>“If Katherine Gagne isn’t going to resign, then folks have recognized she has to be defeated and so there was a good conversation about how we can organize to make sure Katherine Gagne does not win next year’s election,” said Peterson.</p>
      <p>He noted there were a number of people interested in running as trustees, and QCFA plans to launch an education campaign in the new year to teach people about how they can run to be a board member.</p>
      <p>While Peterson hopes to see Gagne either resign from her position or be defeated in the school board election next fall, he said the option to go through the court has not been completely ruled out.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://publications.saskatchewan.ca/#/products/87449">The School Division Administration Regulations</a>, a board member can be removed if a minimum of five electors apply for an order to a Court of Queen’s Bench judge. The judge then decides if someone is “unfit to act as a member of the board of education.”</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Peterson said QCFA also hopes to reach out to other community organizations who already work to make Regina more inclusive, looking for ways the group can contribute throughout the city.</p>
