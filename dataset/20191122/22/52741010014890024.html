      <p>You can have a hand in giving a Special Olympian a memorable experience when they arrive here for the 2020 Spring Games in May.</p>
      <p>The Draft an Athlete program was launched at Waterloo Regional Police headquarters on Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Organizers are asking both residents and businesses to get involved.</p>
      <p>Each $500 donation will help cover expenses such as travel, food and accommodations.</p>
      <p>Games co-chair, Ron Caudle of Caudle's Catch Seafood, will be drafting an athlete - and is also establishing a team to draft an athlete through his business.</p>
      <p>"The athletes that are here, they go beyond to be the best they can be in their sports. And I want our community to go beyond to help these athletes have the best games ever," Caudle told the news conference. </p>
      <p>Over 600 athletes from across Ontario will be here May 21-23, to compete in sports such as basketball, swimming and ten-pin bowling.</p>
      <p>One of those athletes is swimmer Cooper Moore.</p>
      <p>"I'm excited for the opportunity to compete in the 2020 Spring Games, have fun and also try my very best. My parents and my brother are very excited, they can't wait to cheer me on." explained the Cambridge resident.</p>
      <p>Police services throughout the province have been hosting Special Olympics Ontario Provincial Games since 1996, but this will mark the first time Waterloo Regional Police have served as host.</p>
      <p>"We hope to ensure that every ... more than 635 athletes are drafted. You'll get to follow them along through all kinds of different processes ... you can also follow the success and you can follow all of the excitement of the athlete as they get ready." added Waterloo Regional Police Chief, Bryan Larkin.</p>
