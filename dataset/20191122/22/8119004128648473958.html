      <p>“Mamata Banerjee said any Bangladeshi businessman can also set up bicycle plant in West Bengal if they want to. She offered help by providing land. She said such plants can be set up in Bangladesh along the border as well to reduce transport cost,” Momen told the media.</p>
      <p>Mamata also emphasised cooperation between Bangladesh and West Bengal on education, healthcare, culture, and arts.</p>
