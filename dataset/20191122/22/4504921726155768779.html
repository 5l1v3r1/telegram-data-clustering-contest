They however promised to give their all in the ring.<br/>"I promise you, I'm going to destroy Pambeni just come and see how I'm doing to do it. I want to show you this is my time, so I prepared hard. Pambeni' history will come to and end this time around just come to the Windhoek Country club and come and see it" Nakathila said.<br/>The visiting Pambeni, who is no stranger to Namibia, plea for fairness from the judges during the fight.<br/>"I wish that justice will prevail so that we can enjoy the fight.

I don't know what will happen in the ring" Pambeni said.<br/>The event will kick off on Saturday at 18h00.<br/>All tickets are on sale for N$200-00</p>
