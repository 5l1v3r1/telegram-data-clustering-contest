      <p><b>SAN JUAN, Puerto RicoÂ (AP)</b> - A critically endangered Puerto Rican toad has for the first time been born via in vitro fertilization as U.S. scientists attempt to save it from extinction.</p>
      <p>Officials told The Associated Press Friday that the Puerto Rican crested toad - named Olaf in honor of the frozen semen he came from - is one of more than 300 that hatched.</p>
      <p>Fort Worth Zoo ectotherm curator Diane Barber said Olaf will remain in Texas but 200 toadlets will be released in Puerto Rico.</p>
      <p>She said the other 100 will be sent to zoos with captive breeding programs.</p>
      <p>Barber was part of a team that traveled to the southwest town of Guayanilla last year to collect semen from six male Puerto Rican crested toads that were later released back into the wild.</p>
