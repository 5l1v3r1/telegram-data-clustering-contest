      <h1>Marco Silva explains Everton's transfer stance on Moise Kean amid reports of unrest</h1>
      <h2>Kean's father Jean went on record speaking about his son's unhappiness at Everton, prompting reports that the striker could be sold in the near future</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Marco Silva has insisted Moise Kean will NOT be sold in January, despite a troubled start to his <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> career.</p>
      <p>The striker’s father Jean went on record to slam the £27.5m transfer to Everton, insisting: “Sending my son to England was a mistake, because he's still too young, he's not feeling good at Everton.</p>
      <p>“I didn't like this transfer. I hope he can come back to Italy as soon as possible.”</p>
      <p>And speculation mounted further about a swift Kean return to his homeland, when he was axed from the Everton squad which played at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> two weeks ago, due to alleged discipline problems when he turned up late for a meeting.</p>
      <p>Silva refused to confirm that was the reason for the striker’s absence, but he did spell out, when asked, there is no chance the Italy international will be sold when the transfer window opens in January.</p>

      <p>“No. Definitely not, it doesn’t make sense for us. The situation with Moise Kean is the same as when we signed him. Nothing has changed,” the Blues boss said.</p>
      <p>“When we signed him we knew we were signing a player with talent, who had good moments with his previous club at a high level, but in short periods of four or five starts for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> .</p>
      <p>“We knew coming to the Premier League would be completely different for him. Even if he was coming from a high level. The time so far has proved all of that. We won’t allow him to go. They are just rumours.”</p>
      <p>Silva was pressed on the absence from the squad at Southampton, but refused to confirm it was because he missed the meeting. “Are you sure about that? There was nothing from myself or the club about him being late.</p>

      <p>“I don’t like to talk about what happened inside the club. I was asked after the Southampton game why Moise Kean wasn’t on the squad list and I was clear that it was my decision. Every decision I make is because I think it is the best for the team.”</p>
      <p>Silva did reveal that he has had a heart to heart with the striker, and made clear that there can be no more controversies.</p>
      <p>“Moise arrived yesterday and he had straight feedback from myself. We had a chat about all the rumours and his game.</p>
      <p>“We spoke about many situations, about rumours, everything that has happened, what I want from him and all the others.</p>
      <p>“That is to try and be focused on your job and today with social media that is not easy. These things you cannot control. We try and give the right feedback to be focused on your job and your role with Everton. Nothing more. He had this feedback from myself.”</p>
      <p>Kean will be back in the squad - but likely on the bench - for the visit of Norwich tomorrow. Silva revealed that Fabian Delph is a doubt, and while Bernard has returned to training after injury, he will not be risked.</p>
