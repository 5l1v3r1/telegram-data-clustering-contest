      <p>Brendan Rodgers has claimed that Kasper Schmeichel should now be considered as a legendary Premier League goalkeeper in his own right.</p>
      <p>Schmeichel was always destined for comparisons with his father, Peter, who lifted five league titles with Manchester United, but Rodgers insists he has now proved he is one of the best in Europe.</p>
      <p>A title winner with Leicester in 2016, and a model of consistency since joining the club five years earlier, Schmeichel has also emerged as a key player in the Rodgers revolution.</p>
      <p>The 33 year-old has only conceded eight goals in the league this season - the best record in all four divisions - and will face Brighton on Saturday aiming for a fourth successive clean sheet. </p>
      <p>“He is one of the top goalkeepers in European football. He probably doesn’t get the credit he deserves, there’s no doubt about that,” said Rodgers.</p>
      <p>“Everyone talked about his father but this is a boy who in his own right has come through the hard way. He’s gone out on loan, up to Scotland, gone out to various clubs, living up to that pressure. </p>
      <p>“You can never imagine that, to play under the ‘Peter Schmeichel’s my dad’. But that’s something he’s had to fight with all his life. And now it’s about Kasper Schmeichel, which he’s thoroughly deserved.”</p>

      <p>Rodgers believes one of Schmeichel’s many under-rated qualities is his passing ability, putting him on a level with Manchester City’s Ederson and Liverpool’s Alisson.</p>
      <p>With Leicester adopting a high-intensity, pressing style of play under Rodgers, the importance of having a goalkeeper comfortable in possession has become even more crucial.</p>
      <p>“There’s absolutely no question he’s up there with those two,” said the Leicester manager.</p>
      <p>“His choice of pass is absolutely phenomenal, the quality that he has, to pass short and long.</p>
      <p>“His view of the game is so good and his concentration. When you’re pressing so well and you maybe don’t have so much to do, when he is called upon his concentration is so high. </p>
      <p>“I’m very lucky to have him here. When I came in I knew his distribution was very good and with how we want to play, it’s perfect for him.”</p>
