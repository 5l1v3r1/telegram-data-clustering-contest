      <h1>Biden lashes out at Graham on Ukraine: 'I'm just embarrassed by what you're doing'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:51:31+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:51</time> by <a rel="author">Marty Johnson</a></address>
      <p>Former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> lashed out at Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/lindsey-graham">Lindsey Graham</a> (R-S.C.) on Friday after the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman asked the State Department to hand over any documents pertaining to the Bidens and Ukraine.</p>
      <p>"I am disappointed and, quite frankly, I'm angered by the fact," Biden said on "CNN Tonight with <a href="https://thehill.com/people/don-lemon">Don Lemon</a>."</p>
      <p>"He knows me. He knows my son. He knows there's nothing to this."</p>
      <p>When asked by Lemon what he would say to Graham if he saw him, Biden responded, "I'm just embarrassed by what you're doing, for you." He added that the South Carolina Republican is "about to go down in a way that I think he's going to regret his whole life."</p>
      <p>Graham's focus on Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, comes as congressional Republicans have raised the issue repeatedly during the public impeachment hearings into <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a>, who asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on a July 25 phone call to investigate Biden and his son’s dealings in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have criticized Democrats for not investigating the Bidens and their connection to Ukraine. Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Kyiv-based natural gas holding company, while his father was vice president.</p>
      <p>In 2016, Joe Biden pushed for the dismissal of Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin as prosecutor, citing concerns he was ignoring corruption in his own office, and threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine if the Shokin was not fired. There is no evidence that Joe Biden was acting in the interest of his son, and he has consistently denied allegations that he was motivated by family considerations.</p>
      <p>Trump, meanwhile, has <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/471627-trump-repeats-debunked-ukraine-claim-a-day-after-hills-tough">pointed to debunked allegations</a> that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 elections.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Trump's former National Security Council adviser on Russia, <a href="https://thehill.com/person/fiona-hill">Fiona Hill</a>, chastised Republicans for promoting the conspiracy theory.</p>
      <p>"Please [do] not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests," Hill said during her testimony. "The fictions are harmful even if they are deployed for purely domestic political purposes."</p>
