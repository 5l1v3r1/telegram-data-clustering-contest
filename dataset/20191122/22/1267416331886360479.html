      <h1>Huawei selling Freebuds Lite at Vidéotron, Watch GT at The Source</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:00:56+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/dean-daley" target="_blank">Dean Daley</a></address>
      <p>It’s currently still unclear if the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/09/19/huawei-mate-30-pro-unveiling/">Mate 30 series</a> or the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/02/24/huawei-mate-x-foldable/">Mate X</a> will ever come to Canada.</p>
      <p>Both phones seem to only be available in China right now. However, you can still purchase the Huawei P30,<a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/07/01/huawe-p30-lite-review/"> P30 Lite</a> and<a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/04/11/huawei-p30-pro-review/"> P30 Pro here</a>. When you buy the P30 and P30 Pro through all major carriers, you’ll get the Freebuds Lite wireless earbuds for free.</p>
      <p>However, for those who already have the device or just want the earbuds, Vidéotron in Quebec is now selling the Freebuds Lite for $169.99 CAD.</p>
      <p>Further, <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/05/05/huawei-watch-gt-review/">Huawei’s Watch GT</a> is bow available at The Source for $259.99. Lastly, the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/01/07/huawei-mediapad-m5-lite/">MediaPad M5 Lite</a> tablet is available at Visions Electronics for $389.99.</p>
      <p>We’ll keep everyone updated regarding whether Huawei’s Mate series is coming to Canada.</p>
