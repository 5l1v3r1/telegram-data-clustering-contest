      <p>For the first time in 32 years, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/borussia-dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> conceded three first-half goals at home. And it came against the most unlikely opposition, in newly-promoted Paderborn, who were perched at the bottom of the 2019-20 Bundesliga table ahead of the matchday-12 trip to the Signal Iduna Park.</p>
      <p>Making five changes from the team which lost 0-4 in the Der Klassiker in Munich, Dortmund were the slower side in the opening exchanges as Paderborn opened the scoring inside five minutes courtesy striker Streli Mamba.</p>
      <p>This marked a league-high sixth time Paderborn had scored in the opening 15 minutes of a Bundesliga game this season. Jolted into action, Dortmund strung together a few decent attacking moves but it was the away side that scored the second of the game eight minutes from the breather.</p>
      <p>Dortmund paid a high price for playing a high defensive line. Ben Zolinski's brilliant ball found Mamba, whose scorching pace left a bevy of Dortmund defenders in his wake. The Congolese striker calmly stroked the ball past Roman Burki to stun the capacity 81,365 crowd at the Signal Iduna Park.</p>
      <p>Last season's runner-ups were jolted further on the stroke of half-time when Gerrit Holtmann made it 3-0 for the visitors, as a shell-shocked Dortmund stared at a first home defeat of the season..</p>
      <p>After Julian Brandt replaced the hobbling striker Paco Alcer on the cusp of half-time and Thorgan Hazard and Achraf Hakimi were thrown into the fray by Lucien Favre, Dortmund pulled a goal back through Jadon Sancho two minutes into the second half. With a renewed sense of vigour, the home side began to pile on the pressure on Paderborn as Marco Reus' low shot was saved by the Paderborn keeper and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/mats-hummels">Mats Hummels</a> headed wide from a corner.</p>
      <p>At the other end, Mamba squandered a gilt-edged chance for the visitors to put the game to bed at the hour mark, as he drilled an effort wide of the far post. Then seven minutes from time, Hummels' cross was expertly headed in by Axel Witsel to further reduce the arrears as a grandstand finale ensued.</p>
      <p>A minute later Sancho hooked an effort clear but an equalizer was not long in coming. Reus' close-range finish in the third minute of stoppage time rescued a draw for the hosts, a result that looked improbable for large swathes of the game against a determined Paderborn.</p>
      <p>Here are the three talking points from the Matchday-12 fixture of the 2019-20 Bundesliga season, between Dortmund and Paderborn.</p>
      <h4>#1 Paderborn have scored the most goals in the opening 15 minutes of a Bundesliga game this season</h4>

      <p>By opening the scoring inside five minutes at the Signal Iduna Park, bottom-placed Paderborn became the first team to score six goals inside the opening 15 minutes of a Bundesliga game this season.</p>
      <p>Despite their sprightly start which saw them surge to an improbable 3-0 half-time lead, the visitors were unable to take back all three points as Dortmund scored an injury-time equaliser to force a share of the spoils.</p>
      <h4>#2 Dortmund concede 3 first-half goals in a home game for the first time in 32 years</h4>

      <p>For the first time in 32 years, Dortmund conceded three first-half goals in a home game. A double from Streli Mamba and one from Gerrit Holtmann stunned a capacity Signal Iduna Park.</p>
      <p>To their credit though, Dortmund coach Lucian Favre's half-time pep-talk had the desired effect on his team. The hosts scored three second-half goals to escape with a point.</p>
      <h4>#3 Dortmund preserve their unbeaten home record in all competitions this season</h4>

      <p>Borussia Dortmund were in serious danger of enduring their first home defeat in nine games (in all competitions) this season when they conceded three first-half goals at home for the first time in 32 years.</p>
      <p>However, the hosts fought back in the second half through goals from Jadon Sancho, Axel Witsel and captain Marco Reus. The captain's close-range finish in stoppage time meant that Dortmund avoided a first home defeat of the season.</p>
      <p>Prior to the matchday-12 visit of Paderborn to Signal Iduna Park, Dortmund were unbeaten in nine games in all competitions this season which included five games in the Bundesliga, two in the UEFA Champions League, one in the German Super Cup and one in the DFB Pokal.</p>
