      <h1>Tom Brady elbow injury pops up out of nowhere</h1>

      <p>Tom Brady made a surprise appearance on the Patriots injury report on Friday.</p>
      <p>The 42-year old quarterback is listed as questionable for this week’s matchup against the Cowboys with an elbow issue. Brady was limited in Friday’s practice but is expected to play this week, according to multiple reports.</p>
      <p>The decision to limit Brady in practice was about “managing” the elbow, NFL Network reported.</p>
      <p>This is Brady’s 18th season in the league and he has not missed a start due to injury since 2008, though he was a regular sighting on the weekly injury report. According to a 2017 ESPN report, he had appeared on the weekly list 186 times, most often due to shoulder issues.</p>
      <p>Rookie Jarrett Stidham, 23, from Auburn University, is the Patriots backup quarterback. Stidham has appeared in mop-up duty twice this season, competing 2-of-4 passes and throwing a pick-six against the Jets.</p>
      <p>The 9-1 Patriots have had the best defense in the league this season, which has obscured <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/tom-bradys-attitude-for-salvaging-patriots-offense/">offensive woes on the other side of the ball</a>. Their first loss came against Lamar Jackson and the Ravens on Nov. 3. They face the 6-4 Cowboys offense on Sunday, who come into this game atop the NFC East.</p>
      <p>The hobbled Patriots team could also be without receivers Mohamed Sanu and Phillip Dorsett, as well as special teams captain Matthew Slater.</p>
