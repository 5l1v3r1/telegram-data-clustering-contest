        <b>2020 watch: Behind Biden’s Slips of the Tongue</b>
      </p>
      <p>The conventional narrative about Joe Biden’s gaffes has been that “his age was a problem, that he was confused and out of touch,” but, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/01/joe-biden-stutter-profile/602401/">as The Atlantic’s John Hendrickson explains</a>, few people know about the former vice president’s stutter, a condition he’s dealt with since boyhood that may help explain some of his verbal slip-ups. Biden rarely mentions his condition, but when he does, he usually refers to it in the past tense, talking about “how he overcame his speech problem, and how he believes others can, too.” Hendrickson, a fellow stutterer, is sympathetic to Biden’s desire to show that “stuttering truly doesn’t matter” — but if he talked about it more, Hendrickson muses, it would mean that it truly didn’t matter “for him, for me, or for our 10-year-old selves.”</p>

        <b>From the left: The Lack of Heat on Pete</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pete Buttigieg and his team were expecting multiple attacks in Wednesday’s debate, <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/11/why-no-one-is-attacking-pete-buttigieg.html">reports Gabriel Debenedetti in New York Magazine</a>, but the “pile-on” <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/why-pete-buttigieg-has-to-feel-good-after-latest-debate/">didn’t happen</a> — partly because his opponents are still trying to figure out what kind of frontrunner he is. As the Biden campaign insists, Buttigieg’s voters in Iowa are far from locked in, and few of his rivals want to “be the one” to knock him and risk turning off potential converts. The young candidate will eventually draw “heat,” Debenedetti posits, if only because of other candidates’ “jealousy and frustration.”</p>

        <b>Foreign desk: Iranians Rage Against the Regime</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Thousands of protestors feeling financially squeezed in Iran have taken to the streets,” <a href="https://www.jns.org/triggered-by-rising-gas-prices-iranian-protestors-call-on-regime-to-end-support-for-global-terror/">JNS’s Israel Kasnett reports</a>. Though ostensibly in response to the regime’s economic policies, and specifically its gas-price hikes, the protests reflect “widespread and growing public discontent” with Tehran’s diversion of “much-needed money to fund international terrorism.” In fact, Iran expert Yossi Mansharof says an end to funding terrorists is “one of the major demands of the protesters.” And “some elements” want even “more radical change” — “Death to [Supreme Leader] Khamenei!” is “one of the dominant calls heard on the streets.” It’s difficult to predict the protests’ outcome, but even if Iran’s rulers manage to suppress them, another Iran expert, Raz Zimmt, thinks “it’s only a matter of time until a new one arises.”</p>

        <b>Impeachment beat: Sondland’s Slick Stratagem</b>
      </p>
      <p>Democrats and the media presented Ambassador Gordon Sondland’s testimony Wednesday — that there was a quid pro quo in the Ukraine affair — as an anti-Trump “bombshell.” In truth, it was an “attention-grabbing and enormously clever gambit to get out of a jam,” <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/ambassador-sondlands-slick-move">argues the Washington Examiner’s Byron York</a>. Inconsistencies in Sondland’s deposition had gotten him in trouble, so, to save himself, he asserted Wednesday that there was a quid pro quo between Trump and the Ukrainian president — and, just like that, “talk about Sondland lying to Congress vanished.” Republicans later got the ambassador to admit he was only “presuming” the existence of a quid pro quo, but Dems had gotten what they wanted, and “the notion that Sondland’s testimony was a bombshell quickly hardened into conventional wisdom.”</p>

        <b>Culture take: The Case for Campus Free Speech</b>
      </p>
      <p>The new documentary “No Safe Spaces,” which highlights “the crackdown on free expression” on college campuses, puts viewers “in the company of some rather ‘dicey comrades,’” like Ann Coulter, Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos, <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/no-safe-spaces-review-adam-carolla-dennis-prager-1203409733/">snarks Owen Gleiberman at Variety</a>. But “if you’re a religious believer in the First Amendment, then in ‘No Safe Spaces’ people like Coulter and Shapiro become the de facto ‘good guys,’” while the “bad guys” are the students, “who, in numbers that are rapidly approaching 50 percent (according to a survey by the Pew Research Center), don’t believe that the principles of the First Amendment should apply to ‘hate speech.’” The film “makes the case for why it’s actually healthy, if not essential, to be exposed to ideas you disagree with and even violently don’t like; it toughens the muscles, preparing you for the rigors of the world” and “mounts a compelling argument against the self-perpetuating psychology of victim culture.”</p>
