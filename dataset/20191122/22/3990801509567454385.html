      <h1>Everything the Cybertruck looks like, according to the internet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:15:32+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenextweb.com/author/rachelkaser/" target="_blank">Rachel Kaser</a></address>
      <p>Elon Musk revealed the Cybertruck, Tesla’s handsome new machine, in all its angular glory. It’s a very cool car, but that doesn’t mean the internet isn’t going to poke fun at how utterly <i>weird</i> it looks. If you can count on Twitter and Reddit for nothing else, you can count on it for that.</p>
      <p>Naturally, we took our own potshots here at TNW when we saw this thing. My colleague Callum Booth <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2019/11/22/watch-tesla-cybertruck-unbreakable-amored-glass-break/">coined the lovely phrase</a> “fascist Toblerone” to describe the shape, which isn’t that far off. My other colleague Napier Lopez <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2019/11/22/tesla-unveils-the-wildly-futuristic-cybertruck-starting-at-39900/">compared it to the Batmobile</a>, also apt. I’d say it looks a bit like <i>Back to the Future</i>‘s Delorean.</p>
      <p>But of course the internet pulled out all the stops, posting photoshop jobs and side-by-side comparisons for just about every futuristic fictional car under the sun. This <i>Total Recall</i> tweet is one of my favorites:</p>

        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/vander_living/status/1197731205627535360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Perhaps it’s not a surprise, give how “polygon-ish” it looks, that the main points of comparison are in video games. It bears a pretty striking resemblance to <i>Halo</i>‘s Warthog, albeit if <i>Halo </i>took a bit of a graphical downgrade.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It’s also been superimposed onto just about every racing game from the NES era.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/turtlepower/status/1197769739096870912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>The car’s angular lines make it look a lot like a certain Pokemon:</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/_eziquio/status/1197733726005927936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>And my personal favorite comparison, Lara Croft’s infamous chest:</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/TheKingsletter/status/1197741797109186561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>One Reddit user pointed out that it looks like it belongs a little ways into the future:</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/e00asp/cybertruck_2077/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Cybertruck 2077</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/">gaming</a></blockquote>
      <p>Interestingly, that’s the only one that Elon Musk himself has thus far deigned to address:</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1197807605906673669?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Naturally, that has some speculating that the car could be making an appearance in <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>. I’m going to guess it’s Elon and CD Projekt Red’s social media manager screwing with us — but hey, I can’t say it would look out of place.</p>
