      <h1>Coldplay Won’t Tour Behind ‘Everyday Life’ Due To Environmental Concerns</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T22:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Kelley</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/coldplay">Coldplay</a> is back with their double-album, <i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Coldplay/Everyday-life">Everyday Life</a></i>—but they won’t go on tour in support of the new release due to environmental concerns.</p>
      <p>“We’re not touring this album,” frontman <a href="https://genius.com/artists/chris-martin">Chris Martin</a> told <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-50490700">BBC News</a>. “We’re taking time over the next year or two to work out how our tour can not only be sustainable [but] how can it be actively beneficial.”</p>
      <p>The English band toured behind their previous album, <i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Coldplay/A-head-full-of-dreams">A Head Full of Dreams</a></i>, between 2016 and 2017. According to <i><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/coldplay-pause-tour-environment-carbon-emissions-915764/">Rolling Stone</a></i>, they played 122 shows around the globe.</p>
      <p>“All of us have to work out the best way of doing our job,” he said. While this isn’t necessarily the end of Coldplay tours, the band wants their future treks to “have a positive impact.”</p>
      <p>“Our next tour will be the best possible version of a tour like that environmentally,” he continued. “We would be disappointed if it’s not carbon neutral. The hardest thing is the flying side of things. But, for example, our dream is to have a show with no single use plastic, to have it largely solar powered. We’ve done a lot of big tours at this point. How do we turn it around so it’s not so much taking as giving?”</p>
      <p>This development doesn’t mean they’re not playing at all. The band is performing two shows in Jordan on Nov. 22, and both of them will be live streamed on YouTube. Come Nov. 25, the Brits will hold a charity concert at the Natural History Museum in London.</p>
      <p>Their latest album is centered around positivity. Martin spoke to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVgIDJSVV3U">BBC Radio 1’s Annie Mac</a> about the meaning behind <i>Everyday Life</i>. “There’s so much life bursting out on the planet,” he said. “[The album is] our reaction to the perceived negativity that’s everywhere. And there is a lot of trouble, but there’s also so much positivity and so much great life happening. In a way, it’s just trying to make sense of things.”</p>
      <p>This is their first full-length since 2015’s <i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Coldplay/A-head-full-of-dreams">A Head Full of Dreams</a></i>.</p>
