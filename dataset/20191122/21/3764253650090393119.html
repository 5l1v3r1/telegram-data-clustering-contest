      <p>In efforts to curb corruption in the service, the Comptroller-General of Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Col. Hameed Ali (rtd), has threatened to sack any officer who is living above his or her remuneration or who is involved in illicit ways to acquire wealth.</p>
      <p>The Customs boss disclosed this while decorating some newly promoted officers of the service in Abuja on Friday, November 22.</p>
      <p>Ali consequently warned that no officer in the service should live above his or her earnings if they desire to remain in service.</p>
      <p>He insisted that every officer could survive within the remuneration package of the service, if well managed.</p>
      <p>He also urged them to prioritise their needs because this will actually help them meet the needs.</p>
