      <p>The Pittsburgh Steelers have ruled out James Conner and JuJu Smith-Schuster ahead of Sunday's game against the Cincinnati Bengals.</p>
      <p>Both players did not participate in practice on Friday, leading to the Steelers confirming neither will be involved in the Week 12 AFC North clash at Paul Brown Stadium.</p>
      <p>Running back Conner aggravated a shoulder injury during the first quarter of the Steelers' 21-7 loss to the Cleveland Browns last Thursday.</p>
      <p>In his absence, Jaylen Samuels, Trey Edmunds and Benny Snell – who is back after missing three games with a knee problem – will be used in the rushing game, while recently signed Kerrith Whyte is also set to feature.</p>
      <p>"I expect Whyte to be ready to go this Sunday, and really not have many limitations," offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner told the team's official website.</p>
      <p>Wide receiver Smith-Schuster, meanwhile, suffered both a concussion and a knee problem against the Browns. Like Conner, he had not been involved in practice for three straight days.</p>

      <p>Diontae Johnson also had a concussion in the same game, but the receiver was a full participant on Friday.</p>
      <p>"We continue to lose guys," said Pittsburgh tight end Vance McDonald.</p>
      <p>"Diontae is expected to step up and be a huge contributor for [quarterback] Mason [Rudolph] and the offense. I am excited to see how he can bounce back from a devastating hit like that and continue to build."</p>
