      <h2>The early Thanksgiving pic is doing even bigger business overseas, where it earned $57.8 million in its first three days for a global total through Friday of $99.6 million.</h2>

      <p>Walt Disney Animation Studios' <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/frozen-2-review-1254398"><i>Frozen 2</i></a> is ending the cold snap at the November box office, where it's on course for a record U.S. debut of $110 million to $120 million.</p>
      <p>Queen Elsa and Princess Anna are also singing sweetly overseas, where <i>Frozen 2</i> has earned $57.8 million in its first three days for a global total through Friday of $99.6 million. And it set opening day records for a Disney Animation or Pixar title in China, the U.K. and Poland.</p>
      <p>In North America, it's headed for the best November opening of all time for an animated pic, as well as one of the top five starts ever for any animated title, not adjusted for inflation (no animated movie outside of summer has crossed the century mark in its launch). Friday's queenly, record haul of $41.8 million includes <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-frozen-2-takes-85m-thursday-night-previews-1257159">$8.5 million in Thursday night previews</a>.</p>
      <p>The first <i>Frozen</i>, which opened domestically the Wednesday before Thanksgiving in 2013, set a holiday animated record with a five-day gross of $93 million, including $67 million for the three-day weekend. It went on to earn $1.28 billion at the global box office to become the top-grossing animated film of all time, not adjusted for inflation.</p>
      <p>The November box office could use some good news. Through Thursday, ticket sales for the month were running 27 percent behind last year following such misses as <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> and <i>Doctor Sleep</i>. The strength of <i>Frozen 2</i> should help to narrow the year-over-year deficit of 6 percent.</p>
      <p>Overseas, <i>Frozen 2</i> is also off to a red-hot start overseas, where it is opening in a total of 26 markets, including major territories South Korea, France, Germany and Japan, where 2013's <i>Frozen </i>grossed a historic $249 million.</p>
      <p>In <i>Frozen 2</i>, Kristen Bell (Princess Anna) and Idina Menzel (Queen Elsa) reprise their beloved roles. The gang from the original movie will embark on a new journey that goes beyond their homeland of Arendelle, and this time Anna will be joining Elsa on the adventure.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Groff, Josh Gad and Santino Fontana also return from the first film, while new castmembers include Evan Rachel Wood and Sterling K. Brown. Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee also return as co-directors.</p>
      <p>The sequel earned an A- from audiences, compared to an A+ for <i>Frozen</i>. Reviewers also liked it less.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Sony's <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/a-beautiful-day-neighborhood-review-1237823"><i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</i></a>, starring Tom Hanks as the late Fred Rogers, started off with an estimated $4.5 million on Friday for a projected debut of $13 million to $14 million, in line with expectations.</p>
      <p>Marielle Heller directed the critically acclaimed, which isn't a biopic or traditional biographical drama. Instead the feel-good movie traces the real-life friendship between journalist Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys) and Rogers.</p>
      <p>Receiving an A CinemaScore, <i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood </i>looks to come in behind holdover <i>Ford v Ferrari</i>, which is driving toward a second-place finish in its sophomore outing with a gross in the $15 million range. Both <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> and <i>Beautiful Day</i> are competing for older audiences.</p>
      <p>The Russo brothers-produced <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/21-bridges-review-1255400"><i>21 Bridges</i></a>, a cop thriller starring Chadwick Boseman, is expected to follow in fourth place with $9 million to $10 million, also in line with expectations.</p>
      <p>From STXfilms, MWM Studios and Huayi Brothers Pictures, the R-rated pic is challenged by mediocre reviews. Audiences gave it a B+ CinemaScore.</p>
      <p><i>Frozen 2</i>, <i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</i> and <i>21 Bridges</i> are all positioned to take advantage of the lucrative Thanksgiving box office corridor. On Nov. 27, two other holiday offerings will enter the fray: <i>Knives Out </i>and <i>Queen &amp; Slim</i>.</p>
      <p>At the specialty box office, Todd Haynes' <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/dark-waters-review-1254524"><i>Dark Waters</i></a> is on course for a so-so opening location weekend average in the $27,000 range from four theaters in New York and Los Angeles. Mark Ruffalo, Anne Hathaway and Tim Robbins star in the well-reviewed whistleblower drama.</p>
