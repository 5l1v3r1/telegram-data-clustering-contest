      <p>Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots are set to face the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday and it seems mind games have already begun.</p>
      <p>Several members of the team have unexpectedly come up with the flu this week, just mere days before the huge game. That includes starting defensive backs Jourdan Lewis and Xavier Woods.</p>
      <p>Just to make sure their star QB is fine, the team gave Dak Prescott some preventative medication.</p>

      <p>Prescott is coming off a game where he tossed for 444 passing yards and three touchdowns against the Detroit Lions and earned player of the week honors.</p>
