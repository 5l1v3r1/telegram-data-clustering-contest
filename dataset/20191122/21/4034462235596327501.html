      <h2>The countdown for Mercedes' new entry-level SUV has begun.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:00:33+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>While the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/amg-gls-63">Mercedes-AMG GLS 63</a> debuted at the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/features/what-to-look-out-for-at-the-2019-la-auto-show">2019 LA Auto Show</a>, Mercedes is already teasing its next model debut: the new entry-level GLA, which will be one of many new compact models the German automaker has unveiled this year.</p>
      <p>A recent report confirmed the next-generation <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/gla">Mercedes</a>-<a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/gla">Benz GLA</a> will <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/new-mercedes-gla-coming-to-battle-the-bmw-x2">debut in a few weeks</a>, but we now have a specific date. A new dedicated page on the Mercedes website shows a countdown clock with the following caption: "Experience the full potential with the digital-only world premiere of the new GLA."</p>

      <p>The timing of the countdown confirms that the new Mercedes GLA will debut online in under three weeks on December 11. An accompanying teaser image previews the SUV's taller silhouette, but it isn't very revealing. Mercedes hasn't released any more details, but a recent test drive by Autocar revealed some of the pertinent details.</p>
      <p>The new GLA is around 0.78 inches shorter than the current model, but has a 1.18-inch longer wheelbase of 8.9 feet, allowing for extra rear legroom and an adjustable rear seat. It will also be 3.93 inches higher than the current model, which will make the GLA look more like a crossover than a hatchback on stilts and result in more rear headroom. We can also expect some tech upgrades inside the more premium cabin, which will borrow features from the A-Class and GLB including a new MBUX touchscreen infotainment system and 64-color ambient lighting.</p>

      <p>Standard equipment will include automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assistance, speed limit assistance, driver attention monitoring, and keyless ignition. Engine options will also be shared, meaning the base model will be offered with a 2.0-liter turbo engine delivering around 220 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a seven-speed automatic or six-speed manual.</p>
      <p>A plug-in hybrid variant is also expected to join the lineup, which will be followed by<a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/mercedes-amg-gla-45-wants-to-assault-high-performance-crossovers"> more powerful AMG variants</a> launching in the second half of next year, including a range-topping GLA 45 S 4Matic with 415 horsepower.</p>
