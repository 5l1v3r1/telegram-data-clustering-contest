      <p>Thousands of Australians are turning out this morning, to take part in a nationwide protest over oil-drilling in the Great Australian Bight.</p>
      <p>The movement hopes to preserve the pristine Bight forever, by demanding big oil companies back off from the region.</p>
      <p>In various locations around the country this morning, Aussies will participate in ‘paddle-out’ demonstrations.</p>
      <p>On the Gold Coast, one such demonstration is taking place at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/521119531802283/">Currumbin Alley at 9.00am.</a></p>
      <p>“We joined a movement of thousands of people throughout Australia and the world demanding Big Oil backs off and preserves the pristine Bight forever.</p>
      <p>“Now Equinor wants to re-submit their plans for destruction and we’re not going to let them.</p>
      <p>“Join your fellow Gold Coasters for an International Day of Action as people throughout the world say <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/noxwayequinor">#noXwayequinor</a></p>
      <p>“Together our pressure has delayed Norwegian oil corporation Equinor but now lets save the Bight for good,” the Gold Coast event description reads.</p>
      <p>A similar paddle out took place in Burleigh Heads earlier this year.</p>
