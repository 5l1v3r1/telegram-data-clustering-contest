        <i>The following is a press statement from the Press Secretary to the Minister of Home Affairs. We reproduce the statement in full. </i>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A Facebook post by “NUSSU – NUS Students United” (“NSU”) on 17 November 2019 misleadingly quoted Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law, in order to give a false impression of what he had actually said.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>2. The NSU Post quotes Minister Shanmugam as having said, on 7 October 2019,<br/>in Parliament:<br/>“If we do not separate religion from politics, then whose religion comes into<br/>politics?”</p>
      <p>3. The NSU Post then goes on to misuse this quote to falsely assert that if Ms<br/>Rachel Ong, a member of the People’s Action Party, wishes to run for elections, she<br/>must “resign ALL executive decisions with ROHEI, an organisation with religious<br/>leanings.”</p>
      <p>4. This directly contradicted what Minister Shanmugam had said in Parliament.<br/>The Minister had in fact said that Members of Parliament (MPs), even Ministers, can<br/>hold positions in religious organisations:</p>
      <p>- Advertisement -</p>
      <p>“We have had Ministers, Members of Parliament who were lay preachers. So,<br/>they hold senior positions in a religious organisation and who are lay persons<br/>who hold other jobs and businesses. As I have said, they can be Members of<br/>Parliament, they can be Ministers and you cannot be saying they cannot<br/>exercise their (civil and political) rights. I think it is difficult to draw bright<br/>lines…We have got to look at these things with care and without a party lens,<br/>to decide on what is good for Singapore. We must handle these issues with<br/>sensibility, care and wisdom. ”</p>
      <p>5. The Minister did not say that a political candidate running for elections, or an<br/>MP, must resign from all executive positions in organisations with religious leanings.<br/>In fact he said the very opposite, that they can continue to hold such posts, and as he<br/>said, these things must be dealt with wisdom and common sense.</p>
      <p>6. The quote on separation of religion and politics that was set out in the NSU post<br/>relates to a very different point that the Minister had made. He had said that religious<br/>beliefs should not, and cannot be said to be the bases for public policy making. That<br/>is quite different from saying that MPs should resign from all positions, in organisations<br/>with religious leanings. As the Minister said in Parliament, all persons, including<br/>religious leaders, have civil and political rights.</p>
      <p>7. Minister Shanmugam’s speech in Parliament can be found at the Parliament of<br/>Singapore’s website</p>
      <p>8. The NSU Post also takes a quote of Mr Lee Kuan Yew out of context to further<br/>mislead. In 1987, at the National Day Rally, Mr Lee said:<br/>“Churchmen, lay preachers, priests, monks, Muslim theologians, all those who<br/>claim divine sanctions of holy insights, take off your clerical robes before you<br/>take on anything economic or political. Take it off.”</p>
      <p>9. The NSU Post misuses Mr Lee’s quote to falsely assert that he had meant that<br/>religious leaders had no political rights. Mr Lee was actually saying that religious<br/>leaders who wanted to make political statements should not do so in their capacity as<br/>religious leaders. Instead, they should enter the political arena as politicians, and give<br/>their views.</p>
      <p>10. Singapore is a secular state. We do not have an established or official religion.<br/>Nor do we allow anyone to use his or her religion for political purposes, or any group<br/>to promote a religion in the political arena. But this doesn’t mean we are anti-religion<br/>or that we disallow people of faith from participating in politics. A secular state does<br/>not mean we have to be anti-religion. And we are not anti-religion.</p>
      <p>11. It is useful to note that the “NUSSU – NUS Students United” Facebook page is<br/>neither the official page of the National University of Singapore (NUS)’s Student Union,<br/>nor its affiliate’s page. The name, which appears to have been disingenuously chosen,<br/>may lead readers to assume that the views espoused on the page are being expressed<br/>by NUS and/or its students.2 The name as well as its deliberately misleading posts<br/>shows the site is run by people with no integrity, bent on sowing discord and hatred.<br/>The public ought to be discerning of those who launch such attacks from behind the<br/>anonymity of the Internet. Those who launch such attacks should:</p>
      <p>(1) Be more ethical: Do not peddle in falsehoods.</p>
      <p>(2) Be more transparent: Do not try and mislead people as to what you really are.</p>
      <p>(3) Be transparent also about your political leanings, so that readers can judge for<br/>themselves what weight to place on your views.</p>
