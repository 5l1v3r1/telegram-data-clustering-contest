      <h1>Alcatel 3V comes to Canada, now available at Freedom Mobile</h1>
      <h2>The 3V starts at $0 with Freedom Mobile</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:05:53+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/jonathan-lamont" target="_blank">Jonathan Lamont</a></address>
      <p>TCL announced that its Alcatel 3V (2019) smartphone is now available in Canada.</p>
      <p>The China-based manufacturer first announced the Alcatel 3V earlier this month along with news that it <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/08/tcl-launching-alcatel-3v-freedom-mobile/">would come to Freedom Mobile</a>. However, the phone is now officially available.</p>
      <p>The 3V sports a giant 6.7-inch 1440 x 720 pixel resolution HD+ 18:9 display, which takes up most of the front of the device. While there is a bit of a chin and forehead, it isn’t substantial by any means. Additionally, the 3V offers 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage expandable up to an additional 32GB with a microSD card.</p>
      <p>A MediaTek MT6762 2.0GHz octa-core processor powers the phone, and it has a 4,000mAh battery. Around back, the 3V includes a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner and a dual-camera setup. The first camera is a 16-megapixel shooter along with a second 5-megapixel camera. The front camera comes in at 8-megapixel.</p>

      <p>Impressively, the 3V sports a 3.5mm headphone jack — a rare commodity in phones these days.</p>
      <p>Customers interested in the Alcatel 3V will be able to <a href="https://shop.freedommobile.ca/devices/Alcatel/3v?sku=889063507165&amp;planSku=Freedom%202GB">pick one up with Freedom Mobile</a> for $0 with a $5 per month MyTab charge. In other words, you’ll get a $5 per month charge tacked onto the plan of your choice that covers the cost of the phone. Alternatively, you can pay $120 upfront and get the device with no tab charge. Freedom says the MSRP of the 3V is $220.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, no other major Canadian carrier offered the Alcatel 3V.</p>
