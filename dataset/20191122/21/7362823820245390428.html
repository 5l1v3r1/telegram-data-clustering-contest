      <h1>Kacey Musgraves' high-five with Prince Harry got her in trouble: 'I didn't know'</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kacey-musgraves">Kacey Musgraves</a> isn’t giving much thought into being lightly scolded during a chance encounter with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/person/prince-harry">Prince Harr</a>y where the country star broke royal protocol while greeting the Duke of Sussex.</p>
      <p>Musgraves recently recalled crossing paths with Harry at the Royal Variety Performance in 2015 and unforgettably giving Harry, 35, a high-five – to which the “Slow Burn” songstress immediately drew admonishment for the loose greeting.</p>
      <p>A photo, sealing the faux-pas in time, shows Harry and Musgraves having a laugh while exchanging high-fives.</p>

      <p>“Apparently afterwards, the guy that works at the label was like, ‘No, no, no,’” Musgraves told "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAlwk3tlNbQ">Access Hollywood</a>" on Wednesday. “He was like, ‘I can’t believe you gave him a high-five. That’s just unbelievable.’ He’s like, ‘No, there’s a way to address the royal family, and a high-five, going up top is not the way.’”</p>

      <p>However, Musgraves didn’t see the hoopla in the gesture, adding that, in her estimation, she was good to go since he seemed unfazed by the casual salutation.</p>

      <p>“I was like, ‘I didn’t know. He went in for it, so whatever,’” she said.</p>
      <p>Last year, the 31-year-old Grammy-winning singer also addressed the meeting during an interview with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_phTvYlbRs&amp;feature=emb_title">BBC</a>, pointing to her friendly upbringing for the royal snafu.</p>

      <p>“Okay, so I’m from Texas. I haven’t read the manual on royal etiquette. I didn’t really go to elocution lessons or anything,” Musgraves explained. “He came up and he just seemed super friendly, and I put my hand up and he went for it. We had a laugh. And later, when I came back, the label was like, ‘Oh, you shouldn’t have done that.’ That was kind of a no-no.”</p>
