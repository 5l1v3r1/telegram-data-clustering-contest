      <p>The leader of a Chicago street gang could face up to 20 years in prison after allegedly attempting to send monetary aid to ISIS soldiers.</p>
      <p>Jason Brown, who reportedly also identifies as, “Abdul Ja’Me,” was arrested on November 14 for allegedly giving $US500 to a man with the understanding that those funds would make their way to an ISIS soldier fighting in Syria, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/suburban-chicago-man-charged-attempting-provide-material-support-isis">according to the US Department of Justice</a>.</p>
      <p>Little did he know, the person Brown sent the money to was actually a confidential informant. As for the ISIS soldier in Syria; he was actually an undercover FBI agent. A <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1217781/download">federal complaint</a> filed in the Northern District of Illinois and seen by Insider said Brown planned to, “knowingly attempted to provide material support and resources … to a foreign terrorist organisation.”</p>
      <h3>Brown allegedly tried to recruit and radicalize gang members</h3>
      <p>Brown was reportedly the leader of the AHK street gang in the Chicago suburb of Bellwood. The gang, according to the Justice Department, was known for selling drugs, including fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine. According to the federal complaint, the AHK gang also”requires all members convert to Islam.”</p>
      <p>Federal investigators believe Brown, a Lombard, Illinois native, was radicalized during a previous prison sentence. The complaint accused Brown of using his position as leader of the AHK gang to actively recruit support for the Islamic State. According to a conversation with a confidential source outlined in the complaint, Brown was also planning on visiting Syria himself in the near future.</p>
      <p>“I’m fixing to make hijrah over there,” Brown allegedly said. “I’m not gonna tell nobody.”</p>
      <p>If Brown is found guilty, he could face up to 20 years in prison.</p>
