      <h1>BMW Brought A Very Special M8 Gran Coupe To LA</h1>
      <h2>Limited to 400 units, the BMW M8 Gran Coupe First Edition pays tribute to the original concept car.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:50:33+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:50</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>While the next-generation M3, M4, and 4 Series will have some polarizing styling changes previewed by the 4 Concept, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/m8-gran-coupe">BMW M8 Gran Coupe</a> is, by contrast, one of BMW's best-looking models to date. The beautiful high-performance grand tourer was <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/say-hello-to-the-2020-bmw-m8-gran-coupe">unveiled to the world last month</a>, but photos really don't do it justice. Trust us, it looks even better in the metal.</p>
      <p>At the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/features/what-to-look-out-for-at-the-2019-la-auto-show">2019 LA Auto Show</a>, BMW brought the new M8 Gran Coupe to the LA Auto Show for its public debut in its range-topping Competition guise. One of the models on display was the limited First Edition model.</p>

      <p>Limited to 400 units, the BMW M8 Gran Coupe First Edition is finished in a special Aurora Diamant Green metallic finish and Gold Bronze accents as a homage to the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/bmw-makes-us-envious-with-green-concept-m8-gran-coupe">beautiful BMW Concept M8 Gran Coupe</a> revealed earlier this year at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show.</p>
      <p>It also rides on exclusive 20-inch wheels finished in Gold Bronze. Inside, there's a numbered "1 of 400" plaque highlighting the model's exclusivity. Production for the limited number M8 Gran Coupe First Edition will begin in March 2020, but pricing hasn't been announced yet. Only 50 examples are slated for the US.</p>

      <p>Under the hood, the BMW M8 Gran Coupe First Edition is powered by the same 4.4-liter V8 as the regular M8 Gran Coupe Competition, which sends 617 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque to all four wheels through an eight-speed automatic gearbox. 0-62 mph takes three seconds flat before the M8 Gran Coupe Competition maxes out at an electronically limited 155 mph, which can be increased to 190 mph with the optional M Driver's Package.</p>
      <p>Pricing for the M8 Gran Coupe starts at $130,000 and $143,000 for the M8 Gran Coupe Competition, plus a $995 destination charge.</p>
