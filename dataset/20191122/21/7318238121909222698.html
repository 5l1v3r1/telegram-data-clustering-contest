      <h1>Wave of polar air threatens Europe-wide cold snap</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:21:44+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:21</time> by <a rel="author">Rafael Cereceda</a></address>
      <p>A fresh wave of cold polar air is set to hit Europe in early December, according to projections from the latest meteorological models.</p>
      <p>It is caused by a sudden stratospheric warming that pushes cold air from the North Pole further south towards Europe â€” and could even reach parts of North Africa.</p>
      <p>This sudden warming of the stratosphere around Siberia could also potentially destabilise the so-called polar vortex, a phenomenon that keeps cold air close to the Arctic Circle.</p>

      <p>According to the above forecasts, the episode would be relatively fast-paced and would be followed by higher than normal temperatures for the wintry season in Europe.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, another storm travelling in from the Atlantic can be expected this weekend.</p>
      <p>Nicknamed Cecilia, the storm is expected to bring heavy rain, strong winds and waves to the Cantabrian and the Mediterranean in France and Spain.</p>
