      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:55:47+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>A 39-year-old law graduate has been arrested for allegedly stealing cars from parking lots and malls in the capital. According to police, the accused, Rajiv Goel, had tried to evade arrest in 2012 and 2014 for similar cases by posing as an Additional District Judge (ADJ).</p>
      <p>Police said Goel, a law graduate from Ghaziabad, was declared a proclaimed offender by the Rohini court in July 2019 for allegedly being involved in two cases of cheating and theft. He is also allegedly involved in more than 30 cases of auto-lifting in Delhi.</p>
      <p>Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer North) Gaurav Sharma said, “Goel had been evading arrest since 2014. We were looking to arrest proclaimed offenders in the district and found that Goel was lifting cars and had been arrested twice before on charges of impersonation. Using technical surveillance, we traced his address and later arrested him from Rohini Metro station Friday morning.”</p>
      <p>During questioning, Goel told police that he worked as an advocate in Bahadurgarh, Haryana. “In 2012, he was arrested by a police team for theft and had produced a fake ID card. Later, police found he wasn’t a judge and recovered 15 cars from his possession,” said the DCP. He was later released on bail.</p>
      <p>In 2014, police said the accused put a red beacon and the national emblem on a car that he had stolen. He then went to a petrol pump in Rajasthan’s Sikar and left without paying.</p>
      <p>“When picket staff caught the man, he posed as an ADJ from Jaipur and threatened picket staff. He was later arrested by Rajasthan Police,” said a police officer, adding that he got out on bail again.</p>
      <p>Goel told police that he had also worked at a court in Sikar for three months before he was caught. Goel started stealing cars in 2012 after he learned how to break into a locked car by watching videos and movies.</p>
      <p>Police said he would lift cars parked in crowded parking lots outside malls and markets and sell them.</p>
