      <p>Sorry Corey Anderson, but Jon Jones vs. Dominick Reyes is officially happening.</p>

      <p>Jones and Reyes are set to fight for the UFC light-heavyweight title in the Feb. 8 pay-per-view main event. The news was first reported by <i>BJPenn.com</i>’s <a href="https://twitter.com/CTaylor_96/status/1195809400474071040">Chris Taylor</a> and later confirmed to <i>ESPN</i>’s <a href="https://twitter.com/bokamotoESPN/status/1197987717843316736">Brett Okamoto</a> by UFC President Dana White. Jones had said earlier today that the contract was sitting in his email inbox and simply needed a signature.</p>

      <p>In his most recent stint as champion, Jones (25-1) has successfully defended the belt against Thiago Santos and Anthony Smith after defeating Alexander Gustafsson to win the vacant belt at UFC 232. Reyes (12-0) is coming off an emphatic first-round knockout of former 185-pound champion Chris Weidman at UFC Boston last month, and also boasts wins over Jared Cannonier, Ovince Saint Preux, and Volkan Oezdemir.</p>

      <p>The booking leaves two of the division’s top contenders by the wayside: Corey Anderson, who beat Johnny Walker via first-round TKO at UFC 244, and Jan Blachowicz, who defeated Ronaldo “Jacare” Souza by split decision at UFC Sao Paulo.</p>
