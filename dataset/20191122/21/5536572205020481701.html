      <h1>Jarvis Landry Calls Out The NFL For Their ‘Too Severe’ Punishment of Myles Garrett</h1>

      <p>Cleveland Browns wide receiver Jarvis Landry thinks the NFL was too harsh when they handed out a season-long suspension to Myles Garrett.</p>
      <p>“It’s almost like (the NFL is) deliberately trying to mess with Cleveland,” Landry <a href="https://923thefan.radio.com/articles/jarvis-landry-doesn%E2%80%99t-feel-nfl-was-fair-to-myles-garrett">told reporters on Friday.</a></p>

      <p>The Cleveland Browns defensive end is now serving an indefinite suspension after he ripped Mason Rudolph’s helmet off his head and then struck him with it during the tail end of the 4th quarter game of last Thursday’s matchup.</p>
      <p>Jarvis Landry thinks the penalty for Garrett’s actions is “too severe.”</p>

      <p>The entire proces has Landry reading between the lines.</p>
      <blockquote>“With less than 24 hours, they made a decision,” he said. “With the appeal process, you have a guy kicking and punching Myles, and he gets suspended, he gets a game taken off of his [suspension]. Then you have Larry who did way less than that. He still gets suspended for his game. So it makes no sense. Then you have a guy who’s involved and pretty much instigated the whole thing, and nothing happens to him.<br/><br/>“I think the process wasn’t handled appropriately. They expedited the process based on the video footage and based on the reaction of the world.”</blockquote>
      <p>Not everyone thinks that the suspension is too much, as Super Bowl-winning coach Tony Dungy did not mince words when speaking about Garrett and his actions.</p>
      <blockquote>“I’m sorry, I don’t have sympathy with Myles Garrett if in fact that is what happened,” <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/super-bowl-winning-coach-explains-why-he-has-no-sympathy-for-myles-garrett-even-if-a-racial-slur-was-used/">Dungy said via CBS Sports</a>.<br/><br/>“If we’re in the bottom of the pile and Mason Rudolph is kneeing you in the groin or he’s trying to poke your eye out or he’s twisting your knee, something that’s going to affect your ability to do your work and your career, then, yeah, you can go off,” Dungy said. “But you can’t go off because somebody said something to you. All kinds of things get said out there on the field.”</blockquote>
      <p>As far as the rest of the Cleveland Browns go, the team will be facing the Dolphins on Sunday, which will be the first time since Jarvis Landry was traded from the team.</p>
      <p>Landry has 49 catches for 695 yards and three touchdowns this season.</p>
      <p>The Browns are 4-6 compared to the 2-8 Dolphins.</p>
