      <p>The <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/jawaharlal-nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> University Students’ Union (JNUSU) Friday told the high-powered committee, set up by the Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry, that it would not accept even a single rupee hike in the hostel fee.</p>
      <p>Friday was the last meeting of the committee before it submits its report on Monday. The three-member committee had come to the JNU administrative block, where it held its meeting with JNUSU representatives and hostel presidents.</p>
      <p>“We said that the union believes there should not be an increase of even a rupee in the current fee structure. We were also asked by the committee what we think of rich students paying more and economically weaker students paying less. We told them clearly that we will only accept a one-fee structure in this campus,” said JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh, while addressing students after the meeting.</p>
      <p>“At the same time, we also made it clear that there will be no negotiations with the committee; that negotiations have to take place in the statutory bodies of the university with our representatives. It has also been clearly told that the sole person responsible for the situation of the last 26 days is the Vice-Chancellor,” she said.</p>
      <p>A committee member said this would be the last meeting. The committee had earlier met the JNUSU and the JNUTA. The Vice-Chancellor had also been called but he skipped without giving any explanation.</p>
      <p>“We had asked them for suggestions. They reiterated that there should be more dialogue. What seems to be coming out through these meetings is that the existing structures should be used to have a dialogue,” he said.</p>
