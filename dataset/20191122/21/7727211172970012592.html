      <h2>The former footballer was annoyed with his fellow contestants</h2>

      <p>I'm A Celebrity's Ian Wright <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">showed his annoyance</a> tonight as he took a swipe at fellow contestants <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/explosive-argument-rips-im-celeb-17296972">Jacqueline Jossa and Myles Stephenson.</a></p>
      <p>The pair had just returned back from a <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/first-look-im-celebrity-2019-17218236">Bushtucker Trial where there was a savage twist.</a></p>
      <p>Ant and Dec told Jacqueline and Myles that they would have to decide whether or not to send the food to main camp or to the jungle jail.</p>
      <p>The two couldn't decide so did rock paper scissors to make a decision and kept the food for the Jungle jail. </p>

      <p>Meanwhile back in Main Camp, Roman had received a letter containing an announcement.</p>
      <p>He read: "Earlier Jacqueline chose Myles to join her in today's Trial, the Snake Hotel where they won six stars.</p>
      <p>"They were then told they must join the outlaws in the jail house.</p>
      <p>"However they were given the opportunity of whether to feed the main camp or take the food with them. </p>

      <p>"Jacqueline and Myles decided to take the food with them to the Jungle jailhouse.  As a result you have just got rice and beans tonight."</p>
      <p>The camp sat in absolute silence, stunned at the news.  Adele asked Roman if he was telling the truth and he replied that he didn't blame them as they had won the food.</p>
      <p>But not all of the campmates were so understanding - including former football player Ian.</p>
      <p>Visibly frustrated, he said: "And now that's just going to put me in the wrong vibe all day now.</p>

      <p>Later Ian said :"I am gutted. Of course I am.  And I'm not going to be any different than that because I'm actually pleased I'm not in a situation where I'd have to make that choice.  It would have actually made me feel terrible."</p>
      <p>Caitlyn attempted to console Ian, saying: "I worry about Ian.  He can get down and that makes the whole journey even more difficult.</p>
      <p>"They won six stars so they wanted to take it to the camp that they're going to.  I totally understand that.  I saw Ian’s reaction and honesty I kind of feel sorry for him.  Sometimes you're on the winning side, sometimes you're on the losing side.  You just have to learn how to deal with it."</p>
      <p>James told him: "I think that is absolutely the right decision but there are bigger fish to fry and it's important that you have these emotions, it's important that you show it but it's important that you put a line under that."</p>
