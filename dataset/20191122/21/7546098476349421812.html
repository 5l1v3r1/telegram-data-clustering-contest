      <p>Most people are looking for an extra source of income these days.</p>
      <p>Wage growth is limited in the current environment, the best way to boost your main job income seems to be to change jobs. But I wouldn’t call that passive income.</p>
      <p>Many are resorting to get a second job to boost their income, but that’s not passive income either.</p>
      <p>There are plenty of things that we can do to increase our income without leaving the house:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Online surveys and rewards?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Whilst not specifically passive, doing online surveys certainly doesn’t require getting a job or leaving the house. There are plenty of providers out there.</p>
      <p>But, there’s not much money in this, probably only a few dollars an hour. You’d have to do a lot of surveys to make $1,000 a month!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Start an online blog / vlog / other social media?</b>
      </p>
      <p>There is a huge amount of eyeballs on the internet these days. There are plenty of people out there earning a <i>full </i>time income (or more) by writing a popular blog, doing an interesting vlog on YouTube or just having an Instagram-able lifestyle.</p>
      <p>But that’s not for me and I imagine it doesn’t work for most people who try it either.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Property?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s certainly possible to generate a passive income from property. But I don’t think it’s a good idea to think about buying property for income. Most residential property in Australia has such a low gross rental yield that negative gearing (making a cash loss) is inevitable unless you buy it with cash upfront.</p>
      <p>And besides, to buy property you need a large deposit to start with.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cash in the bank?</b>
      </p>
      <p>You’re lucky to find savings accounts with interest rates of 2% these days, I don’t think cash is the answer.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shares</b>
      </p>
      <p>I think the best and only real answer is ASX shares. Once you’ve bought the shares you don’t need to do anything else, that’s true passive income.</p>
      <p>You can start with as little as $500, you don’t need a $50,000 deposit like with property.</p>
      <p>There are excellent dividend shares out there with various yields, depending on the yield and growth you’re looking for.</p>
      <p><b>Washington H. Soul Pattinson and Co. Ltd</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Washington+H.+Soul+Pattinson+and+Co.+Ltd/?ticker=ASX-SOL">(ASX: SOL)</a> has an extremely reliable dividend record with a grossed-up yield of 4%.   </p>
      <p><b>Rural Funds Group</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Rural+Funds+Group/?ticker=ASX-RFF">(ASX: RFF)</a> is one of the most consistent REIT distribution growers with its farmland portfolio and it has a FY20 yield of 5.75%.</p>
      <p><b>WAM Research Limited</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/WAM+Research+Limited/?ticker=ASX-WAX">(ASX: WAX)</a> has grown its dividend every year and has a grossed-up dividend yield of 9.7%.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Foolish takeaway</b>
      </p>
      <p>With interest rates being so low these days I can understand why people need to find extra income. I think ASX shares with fully franked dividends are definitely the way to go.</p>
