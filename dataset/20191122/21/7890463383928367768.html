      <h1>Build your own Warframe battleship in the Rising Tide update</h1>

        <b>The next big step in Digital Extremes’ free-to-play space shooter Warframe is <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/warframe/empyrean-release-date">the Empyrean expansion</a>, which still doesn’t have a release date other than 2020, but it’s looking incredibly exciting – and now the game has taken a medium step toward Empyrean with the Warframe Rising Tide update, which is has just launched.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Indeed, the tagline for this update is “prepare for Empyrean”, but Rising Tide is a big update for Warframe in its own right. For starters, you can build you own giant battleship. You can work yourself, or in a clan, to build the Dry Dock – described as an “all-in-one workshop and garage” for the giant Railjack battleship.</p>
      <p>After the Dry Dock is completed, you’ll be sent on a series of missions throughout the Origin system – orchestrated by a reluctant AI called Cephalon Cy – to gather parts for the Railjack. Once constructed, you’ll be able to take the Railjack into battle in Empyrean – as well as customize it outside of missions with new weapons, parts and mods.</p>
      <p>Rising Tide will also help you upgrade the Liset landing craft so as to further prepare you (and it) for the colossal ship battles and planet landings in Empyrean – although they do all seem to be cosmetic in this particular update, including enhanced lighting and a “moonroof”. Got to have a moonroof in your personal ship.</p>

      <p>While everything we’ve described so far can be earned in-game, there will also be a new set of weapons, armour and cosmetics called the Cumulus Collection – which is available to buy now in the Warframe marketplace, along with new skins for Equinox.</p>
      <p>When Empyrean launches, it’ll add multi-ship crews, massive space battles between these Railjack warships, ship boarding, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/warframe/empyrean-release-date">and a lot more</a>. Rising Tide is just the first step, and it’s available right now on PC. Go play.</p>
