      <p>“Without their support we will not realize our dream of playing in the coming regional meet and play against the top guns of other countries,” said PNFPP founding member and Rep. Mikee Romero.</p>
      <p>“Hats off to POC President and Rep. Bambol Tolentino for all the help, without his backing, our sport will be left out in the cold, and of course to House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano for the valuable support and motivation,” said Romero.</p>
      <p>Romero likewise thanked PSC, especially its chairman Butch Ramirez, for helping fund its training in Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>
      <p>“It was a wonderful experience and we learned a lot during our two-week training camp,” said Romero, who is fast recovering from a bad fall during the team’s Argentina training.</p>
      <p>Meantime, the majestic ‘Bamboo Pavillon’ of the Miguel Romero Field in Calatagan, Batangas will be blessed and inaugurated today.</p>
      <p>Diplomats, high-ranking sports officials and polo enthusiasts are expected to grace the blessing and inauguration.</p>
      <p>“Aside from our beautiful facilities, the Bamboo Pavillon will be a great attraction for polo lovers. Designed exquisitely, it really ooks regal,” added Romero.</p>
      <p>An added appetizer is the friendly game between Team Philippines against some Argentine and British players.</p>
      <p>Polo competitions will start Sunday although the official opening of the biennial meet will be held on Nov. 30 at the massive Philippine Arena in Bocaue, Bulacan.</p>
