          <p>Zaheer Khan has given an innumerable number of moments to India while dawning the blue jersey. Years after his retirement from international cricket, the Indian pacer is still lethal.</p>
          <p>In the newly started T10 league held in Abu Dhabi, the legendary Indian bowler gave a sensational performance for his side showing that he still got the class left in him.</p>

                <p>Zaheer took 2 wickets in his 2 over spell, while only giving 8 runs to the opposition. Certainly, a good stat for any format in cricket, leave alone the T10, over every delivery is hit to send across the boundary line. Moreover, his spell was comprised of five dot balls.</p>
                <p>The former Indian International is definitely out of his prime but his skilful technique is still sharp. In both wickets, Zaheer showed variation to take both the wickets.</p>

                      <p>To take the first wicket, Zaheer delivered a fast bowl which defeated the batsman and took his wicket instantly. Meanwhile, in the second instance, he delivered a slower yorker, which recalled the days of his past and as always the batsman had no response.</p>

                            <p>“Every format of cricket has its own place and fan following. This is the third year of the T10 league and it’s growing every year. So, this format in my understanding can work as a catalyst for the global growth of the sport,” Zaheer was quoted as saying by IANS.</p>
                            <p>“It’s a great thing that this property of T10 is doing great and all the stakeholders associated with it are working in the right direction,” Zaheer added.</p>
                            <p>Amidst all this, Zaheer has certainly proved that class is permanent, even if the player is of 41. Even though Zaheer gave a marvellous performance in his brief bowling spell, yet his side lost the game as Qalandars claimed the victory by 2 wickets.</p>
