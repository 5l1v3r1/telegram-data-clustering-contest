      <h2>Viewers thought they recognised a member of the audience</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:17:53+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/lottie-gibbons/" target="_blank">Lottie Gibbons</a></address>
      <p>Coronation Street fans believed they spotted a familiar face on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/what-bbc-question-time-man-17300328">BBC's Question Time tonight.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn,</a> Boris Johnson, Nicola Sturgeon and Jo Swinson took part in a political debate with a live audience tonight - with all party leaders receiving a grilling.</p>
      <p>But a number of eagle-eyed <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street fans</a> were shocked when they recognised a member of the audience.</p>
      <p>Referred to as 'the lady in the red jacket', the woman from Sheffield quizzed Liberal Democrats leader Ms Swinson over the party's policies on Universal Credit.</p>

      <p>Whilst the woman eloquently discussed the negative affects of the benefit - users on Twitter were distracted by her resemblance.</p>
      <p>Brenda said: "Was she a detective in <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23corrie">#corrie</a> recently? I'm sure I remember her questioning David Platt."</p>
      <p>Another user wrote: "Who was that woman that asked Swinson a question with the red on? I know her face?"</p>

      <p>One eagle-eyed super fan tried to clear things up in the comments section claiming: "From arresting Carla Connor to grilling Jo Swinson on benefits, this is one busy detective."</p>

      <p>Fans believe the woman is Sheffield actress Kate Rutter who appeared on the Cobbles between March and July 2019 while investigating the collapse of Underworld's roof.</p>
      <p>Fans may know her as DS Beckett on the soap.</p>
      <p>She also starred as 'Ann' in the politically-charged drama film I, Daniel Blake.</p>
      <p>According to her Twitter profile, she is a Labour supporter.</p>
