      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/justin-bieber/">Justin Bieber</a> is getting broody as he revealed his baby plans with Hailey Baldwin while wishing her a happy birthday.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old took to Instagram on his wife’s special day with a celebratory post – and it’s too cute.</p>
      <p>Sharing a picture of them on their wedding, the Sorry hitmaker gushed over his other in the caption.</p>
      <p>Writing to the birthday girl, the proud hubby said: ‘Happy birthday babes! You make me want to be better everyday!</p>
      <p>‘The way you live you life is so attractive.. ps you turn me on in every way. Next season BABIES.’</p>

      <p>Right on cue, the singer’s fans flooded the comments section and completely lost it over the thought of mini Biebers.</p>
      <p>‘BABIES WHUT?’ one wrote while another added: ‘B-babies???????????????’</p>

      <p>Someone else commented: ‘Happy Birthday!! And just remember when she gets pregnant take good care of her, it’s hard! I love you both.’</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time Biebs has mentioned <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/11/justin-bieber-wants-daddy-daughter-dates-as-he-reveals-baby-plans-with-wife-hailey-10180372/">his wishes to start a family as he recently revealed he wants a daughter.</a></p>

      <p>Under a picture of himself enjoying a day out in Disneyland with Hailey this summer, the star wrote: ‘Love dates with you baby…</p>
      <p>‘One day I’ll be doing daddy-daughter dates….. not hinting at anything soon I’m not in a rush. I just wanna enjoy you by yourself for a while!’</p>
      <p>And it seems his wifey is on the same page as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/29/hailey-baldwin-says-having-kids-with-justin-bieber-is-a-closer-reality-now-theyre-married-8192663/">she previously confessed she can’t wait to have a mini-me.</a></p>
      <p>‘I love kids and I can’t wait to have my own. I would say now that’s a closer reality,’ she told Vogue Arabia.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old also caught baby fever from Kylie Jenner this month as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/26/hailey-baldwin-catches-baby-fever-and-its-kylie-jenner-and-stormis-fault-10464555/">she commented on a picture of the beauty mogul’s daughter, Stormi.</a></p>
      <p>‘Please stop giving me the most baby fever,’ the model said: ‘She’s the sweetest.’</p>
