      <p>Andy Murray was once again left out for the quarter-final at Madrid's Caja Magica amid doubts about his fitness but he had plenty to cheer from the sidelines as Edmund produced a strong and composed performance to win 6-3 7-5.</p>
      <p>The only disappointment was the size of the crowd, which appeared noticeably smaller than for Britain's two group matches â€“ a concern Murray had raised ahead of the event.</p>

      <p>The British fans who had stayed made a good noise, though, and Edmund responded in style.</p>
      <p>At 36, Kohlschreiber's best days may be behind him but he remains a dangerous customer, particularly off his one-handed backhand, and he has been in good form here.</p>
      <p>The German was a little wild in the first set and Edmund took advantage, securing the only break of serve in the sixth game.</p>

      <p>The second was much tighter. Kohlschreiber became the first player this week to break the Edmund serve for 3-1 but a fine game from the Yorkshireman reduced the arrears straight away.</p>
      <p>Edmund is known for his bulldozer forehand but it was his backhand doing a lot of the damage and another break for 6-5 set up a chance to serve for the match, which he took to love.</p>
      <p>That set the stage for British number one Dan Evans, who kept his place ahead of Murray despite two defeats to lower-ranked players this week, to take on German number one Jan-Lennard Struff.</p>
