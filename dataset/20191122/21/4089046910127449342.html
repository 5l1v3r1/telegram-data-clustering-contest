      <p><b>ST. LUCIE COUNTY, Fla. (WVLT/WFLX)</b> Florida police responded to a call of a dog driving a car in a neighborhood at Port St. Lucie on Friday.</p>
      <p>“I figured ‘how the heck did they manage to do that?’” said neighbor Anna Sabol to WFLX.</p>
      <p>Multiple police arrived on the scene after reports of a Black Labrador spinning in reverse in a grey sedan. The chase happened for nearly an hour.</p>
      <p>According to WFLX, police said the dog was left alone for briefly and accidentally threw the vehicle into reverse.</p>
      <p>Police were able to end the joyride by typing the vehicle's passcode into the driver door; however, the dog had already taken a mailbox out, hit a trashcan and moved some bricks in front of a home.</p>
      <p>No one was hurt, including the dog.</p>
