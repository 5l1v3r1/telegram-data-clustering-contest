      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/anton-du-beke">Anton du Beke</a> says he has no problem dancing with a man and will happily give it a whirl if <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly</a> bosses ask next year.</p>
      <p>The professional dancer said: “It’s just dancing, isn’t it? Fred Astaire danced with Gene Kelly. I’d have been very happy to dance with Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire, I don’t mind.”</p>
      <p>In August, the Mirror revealed BBC bosses were considering a same-sex Strictly pairing next year.</p>
      <p>Anton, 53, recalled dancing with fellow pro Vincent Simone on the show before he left in 2012 and with the late Bruce Forsyth when he was host .</p>
      <p>He said: “This isn’t going to be new for me – I’ve already done it.”</p>

      <p>Anton, now paired with EastEnder Emma Barton, 42, spoke out after 189 viewers complained to the BBC this month after Strictly pros</p>
      <p>Johannes Radebe, 32, and Graziano Di Prima, 25, danced together.</p>
      <p>Anton said: “I just think that this is a dance show, it’s a creative show.</p>
      <p>“Everything that goes on the screen is a creative process – it reflects whatever you feel at that moment in time and often what is going on in society.</p>

      <p>“Strictly is a bit of a mirror on society, actually. And it should be.</p>
      <p>“Stuff like Johannes dancing with Graziano – it’s not such a big deal. As a dancer it isn’t even a thing. It’s quite normal because it’s dance and that’s what dance is. It’s creative.”</p>
      <p>Anton, who picked his favourite dances from the 16 series for a BBC DVD, said making changes had been key to Strictly’s success.</p>

      <p>He said: “In the first couple of series, we stood in front of each other waiting for the music to start, and when it started we danced. Now every week is a production.”</p>
      <p>Anton, the only dancer who has been on the show since it launched in 2004, is delighted with this year’s series. He said: “I got my first 10s. I still absolutely love it.”</p>
