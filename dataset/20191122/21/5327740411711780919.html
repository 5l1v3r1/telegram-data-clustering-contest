      <h1>PHOTOS: NHL honours B.C. grandma’s battle against cancer in special match</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:34:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/sarah-grochowski/" target="_blank">Sarah Grochowski</a></address>
      <p>Born and raised in Aldergrove, current NHL defenceman for the Las Vegas Golden Knights Shea Theodore, battled the San Jose Sharks in a special “Hockey Fights Cancer” match Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Theodore’s own brush with the disease after a failed drug test this summer sparked the game’s dedication. It was heightened hCG hormone levels that alerted doctors to testicular cancer.</p>
      <p>It was the team’s third game this season against the Sharks – only this time, during pre-game warm-up Las Vegas players donned purple jerseys that were auctioned off with proceeds going towards early cancer detection.</p>
      <p>“The fact that I found out early was the biggest key, and that’s what I’m trying to push,” Theodore said in a recent Golden Knights’ interview.</p>

      <p>Theodore, now a survivor, continues to battle the stigma surrounding men’s testicular health both on and off the ice.</p>
      <p>He’s accompanied in the fight against cancer by another member of his family, his grandmother Kay Darlington.</p>
      <p>The Theodore family, from Langley, recently found out that Darlington – whose lived in Mexico for the past few decades – is battling stage-four breast cancer, for the second time.</p>
      <p>“The treatment she underwent in Mexico wasn’t working,” explained Theodore’s older sister Alyssa, also an avid hockey player.</p>
      <p>It didn’t take long for the family, with the help of Golden Knights management, to rush Darlington to the aid of a specialized cancer centre near Theodore in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>“They flew her and my mother in on a private jet from Mexico to Las Vegas” almost as soon as they heard the cancer had spread, Alyssa elaborated.</p>
      <p>“She has a lot of life in her,” she added.</p>
      <p>The team even asked the grandmother to drop the puck at the Nov 21. game’s ceremonial face-off at a packed T-Mobile arena.</p>
      <p>“When they reached out to her she had a couple of tears in her eye,” Theodore admitted.</p>
      <p>Theodore escorted Darlington out onto center ice in her purple jersey. She dropped the puck amidst a sea of cell phone lights and a roar of arena applause.</p>
      <p>“Shea Theodore doesn’t normally take faceoffs, but he took one tonight. And it was one he’ll never forget,” the Golden Knights posted to Twitter.</p>

      <p>The grandmother will soon undergo chemotherapy in her and her family’s continued efforts to conquer the disease.</p>
      <p>During the game, the Vegas Golden Knights Foundation presented a $75,000 check to pediatric cancer organizations.</p>
      <p>Audience members took the opportunity to fill out “I fight for” purple signs in support of their loved ones, and others, irreversibly impacted by cancer.</p>
      <p>Las Vegas defenceman Jon Merrill held up an “I fight for” purple sign that read Theodore’s name.</p>
      <p>Other teammates jotted down the name of their parents, friends, and others.</p>
      <p>The Sharks beat the Golden Knights 2-1 in overtime.</p>
