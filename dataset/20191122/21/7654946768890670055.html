      <h1>Deontay Wilder puts legacy on line in heated Luis Ortiz rematch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:34:28+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:34</time> by <a rel="author">George Willis</a></address>
      <p>There were plenty of skeptics when Deontay Wilder first became a serious contender for the heavyweight championship. He started boxing at an advanced age, he hadn’t fought quality competition and he was too unorthodox. He won a bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics, but no one was paying attention.</p>
      <p>Fast forward a decade, and Wilder has become instrumental in reviving interest in a division that had been forgotten. He will be making the 10th defense of his WBC heavyweight championship Saturday night in a rematch with Luis “King Kong” Ortiz at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas and on FOX Sports pay-per-view.</p>
      <p>Leo Santa Cruz seeks a title in a fourth weight division when he faces Miguel Flores for the WBA “Super” super featherweight championship in the featured undercard bout.</p>
      <p>Andy Ruiz holds the other major belts in the heavyweight division after his stunning upset of Anthony Joshua in June at Madison Square Garden, and Tyson Fury is considered the lineal champion, having never lost a title in the ring. But the 34-year-old Wilder (41-0-1, 40 KOs) is the most established of them all, looking to add to his legacy with a second victory over Ortiz (31-1, 26 KOs)</p>
      <p>“It’s a great accomplishment for myself and for my career,” Wilder said of making his milestone 10th defense. “It’s a great honor, especially when many thought I was never going to be the heavyweight champion. It’s amazing to be at this point in time, and right now all I could do for my career is just rack up numbers. I have always fought for a legend’s legacy, and I’m still fighting to this day for that. I just want to be the best in the world. I want to be the best that has ever done it.”</p>
      <p>Wilder handed Ortiz the first loss of his career on March 3, 2018, at Barclays Center. After nearly being knocked out in the seventh round by the hard fists of Ortiz, Wilder rallied to stop the Cuban in a dramatic 10th round.</p>

      <p>Wilder, from Tuscaloosa, Ala., admitted he was “buzzed” in the seventh, but says he was never hurt.</p>
      <p>“I understood everything that was going on with me,” he said. “I was coaching myself internally. My inner voice was telling myself to keep going, make sure the referee sees you, make sure you keep hitting him. I didn’t want to waste any unnecessary energy because I wanted to be able to recover.</p>
      <p>“I don’t get enough credit for that,” Wilder added. “That’s where the commentaries that were commentating the fight, they didn’t understand what I was doing.”</p>
      <p>Wilder had dropped Ortiz in the fifth, and knocked him down twice more in the 10th as an uppercut did the ultimate damage. The champion was ahead on all three cards, 85-84, in what was a competitive and enjoyable bout.</p>
      <p>Ortiz, 40, has won three consecutive fights since then. Wilder earned a split draw against Fury last December and knocked out Dominic Breazeale at Barclays Center in May.</p>
      <p>During a recent conference call, Ortiz — speaking through an interpreter — seemed to complain that Wilder used “illegal things” in their first fight and said he hoped they “could be dealt with differently this time around.” Those things, according to Ortiz, were “blows that he throws with the inside of his fists, punching down from the top of the head down and all kinds of craziness that he does.”</p>
      <p>Wilder wasn’t too happy to hear about that.</p>
      <p>“He needs to clarify that for me before I take it the wrong way,” Wilder said. “We know when I get mad, it’s over with. I need that clarified or I’m going to take this the wrong way and I’m really going to want to beat him down.”</p>
      <p>The clarification will come Saturday night.</p>
      <p><b>Prediction:</b> Wilder by ninth-round KO</p>
