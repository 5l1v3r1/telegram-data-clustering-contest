      <h2>Whitehall got his hands on a Rangers shirt after playing in Glasgow this week on his Stood Up tour.</h2>

      <p>It's obvious which side of Glasgow comedian Jack Whitehall favours as he joked he would sign for Rangers.</p>
      <p>Whitehall got his hands on a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> shirt after playing a show at The Hydro on his Stood Up tour earlier this week.</p>
      <p>And he sent a hilarious message to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> to see if the Ibrox boss was looking for any reinforcements in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>He said: "Stevie, call me. I'm available"</p>
      <p>Whitehall isn't the first celebrity to pledge their support to the Light Blues after wresting star Drew McIntyre sported a Gers top before the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/wwe">WWE</a> show in Glasgow earlier this month .</p>
      <p>McIntyre was pictured wearing the home shirt with Rangers legend Ally McCoist on the back of it and had a message for the Light Blues fans.</p>
      <p>He said: "You might have noticed I am wearing my Rangers jersey, I am a Rangers fan I think everybody knows that. More importantly I am a Scottish football fan.</p>
      <p>"Rangers and my career over the past few years have been very similar. I got fired, Rangers relegated to the bottom.</p>
      <p>"We both fought fought fought and now we are both back on top.</p>
      <p>"Rangers and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> are being talked about the world, Scottish football is being talked about in the world."</p>
