      <ul>
        <li>The Brooklyn Nets are struggling despite Kyrie Irving’s big numbers.</li>
        <li>The Nets knew they were sacrificing by bringing him in, but he’s changed how they play.</li>
        <li>With every rumor of discontent, it’s more appropriate to wonder if Irving is the cause of Brooklyn’s labors.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even before the Brooklyn Nets were among the NBA’s most disappointing teams a month into the regular season, coach Kenny Atkinson knew exactly what challenges lay ahead.</p>
      <h3>Nets Find Kyrie Irving Is More Trouble Than He’s Worth</h3>
      <p>Brooklyn was the league’s best story last season, a group of also-rans that relied on the culture and chemistry the organization had built over the previous two years to win 42 games and put up a fight against the heavily-favored Philadelphia 76ers in the playoffs.</p>
      <p>The Nets parlayed those accomplishments into one of the biggest free-agency coups ever last summer, signing Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.</p>

      <p>With the promise of contention that accompanies multiple superstars, though, was an <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27947336/for-culture-kd-kyrie-comes-next-nets">inevitable sacrifice of the ethos</a> that ushered in Brooklyn’s stunning turnaround.</p>
      <blockquote>“No one gave us an award for mastering the culture code,” Atkinson told ESPN’s Jackie MacMullan in October. “We’re still learning.”</blockquote>
      <p>And as they struggle to live up to heightened expectations in the season’s early going, the Nets are also learning that Irving – without the injured Durant by his side, at least – may be more trouble than he’s worth.</p>
      <h3>Irving’s on-Court Impact</h3>
      <p>Irving’s individual numbers, as always, are stellar. He’s averaging 28.5 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 7.2 assists per game, all career-highs.</p>

      <p>Brooklyn, 6-8, has won two of three with Irving sidelined by a sore shoulder, but it’s not like the numbers say he’s been a destructive force when available. The Nets’ <a href="https://stats.nba.com/team/1610612751/onoffcourt-advanced/">offensive rating</a> drops a whopping 10 points without him in the game, and his subpar defensive data generally aligns with that of other starters.</p>
      <p>But digging deeper into the numbers reveals that Irving’s overall influence has eroded the attributes that helped propel Brooklyn to success.</p>
      <p>The Nets rank 27th in <a href="https://stats.nba.com/teams/passing/">passes per game</a>, down from eighth last season. Their average <a href="https://stats.nba.com/teams/touches/?sort=AVG_SEC_PER_TOUCH&amp;dir=1">amount of seconds per touch</a> has spiked from 19th to fifth, and Brooklyn is running more pick-and-rolls and isolation plays – further evidence of a lack of ball movement prompted by Irving’s presence.</p>

      <h3>Lessons Learned from Boston</h3>
      <p>This time last year, it was hard to imagine Irving playing for the Nets. At a preseason fan event, he <a href="https://www.nba.com/article/2018/10/04/kyrie-plans-re-sign-celtics">made headlines</a> by saying he planned not only on re-signing with the <a href="https://www.ccn.com/enes-kanter-is-who-the-woke-generation-should-be-looking-up-to/">Boston Celtics</a>, but having his jersey retired at T.D. Garden.</p>
      <p>The Celtics underachieved last season, though, struggling to coalesce despite a wealth of talent. By the time their season was over, it had become clear both parties would be best served by going their separate ways.</p>
      <p>It’s still too early to say Irving has been similarly corrosive in Brooklyn. But as the Celtics thrive and Nets labor, every rumor of discontent warrants more attention.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/FirstTake/status/1197591768864362496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>This is hardly the first time those murmurs have bubbled to the surface during Irving’s time with the Nets, either.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27947336/for-culture-kd-kyrie-comes-next-nets">ESPN famously reported on “mood swings” that left Brooklyn in the dark during a preseason trip to China</a>, while Irving’s mid-possession shove of Dzanan Musa further inflamed talk about his deficiencies as a leader.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Through it all, the Nets have stuck behind Irving, acknowledging the growing pains of adding a player of his talent and personality while insisting that just as big an onus to change is on them. Atkinson, in particular, has defended Irving, knowing his team’s long-term interest is to keep him as happy as possible until the cavalry comes next season.</p>
      <p>But this one has barely started. Brooklyn will only reach its utmost potential <a href="https://www.ccn.com/kevin-durant-reveals-how-he-really-feels-about-nba-analytics/">once Kevin Durant is healthy</a> if Kyrie Irving is fully integrated both on and off the floor. As the first month of 2019-20 and all of last season laid bare, though, that’s a challenge easier accepted than completed.</p>
