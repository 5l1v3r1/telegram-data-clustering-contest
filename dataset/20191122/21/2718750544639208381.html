      <h1>Oh Boy, a Michael Jackson Biopic Is Reportedly Happening</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/bohemian-rhapsody-has-committed-no-crime.html"><i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i></a> producer Graham King is taking on the challenge of fitting <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/12/michael-jacksons-best-songs-ranked.html">Michael Jackson’s life</a> and career into a movie. According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/michael-jackson-movie-bohemian-rhapsody-producer-john-logan-graham-king-1202792922/">Deadline</a>, King has secured the rights to make a film of Jackson’s life from the Michael Jackson Estate. He also has access to the singer’s entire music catalogue. King’s production company, GK Films, has also secured a writer, John Logan. Logan has earned three Oscar nominations for <i>Hugo</i>, <i>Gladiator</i>, and <i>The Aviator</i> (which King produced). Deadline’s Mike Fleming Jr. reports that Jackson’s life won’t be “sanitized” and will include everything from his childhood and fame to his untimely death and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/michael-jackson-abuse-allegations-timeline.html">accusations of child molestation</a>. The sexual-abuse allegations resurfaced recently with the HBO documentary <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/02/leaving-neverland-michael-jackson-hbo-review.html"><i>Leaving Neverland</i></a><i>, </i>which is now involved in a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/leaving-neverland-michael-jackson-hbo-lawsuit.html">$100 million lawsuit</a> with Jackson Estate. King and Logan are reportedly working on the film’s script before deciding on a studio. In the meantime, Michael Jackson’s life is also being turned into a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/michael-jackson-musical-broadway-premiere-date.html">Broadway musical</a> starring Ephraim Sykes, set to open next August.</p>
