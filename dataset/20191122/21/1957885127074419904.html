      <h2>Will support Xbox Live cross-play.</h2>

      <p>Developer Undead Labs' multiplayer zombie survival sequel, State of Decay 2, is, after a year and a half of Windows 10 Store exclusivity on PC, heading to Steam early next year.</p>
      <p>Originally released in 2018, State of Decay 2 aimed to improve on everything that fans loved about its surprisingly popular forebear. However, according Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirwell at launch, it frequently struggled to achieve those goals.</p>
      <p>"State of Decay 2 is a poor return on the scruffy promise of its predecessor," said Edwin <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-16-state-of-decay-2-review-a-soggy-open-world-loot-em-up-with-catastrophic-bugs">in his review</a>, "It tantalises with the thought of raggedy everyday heroes pooling their myriad talents to survive, only to quantify and busywork all that out of existence."</p>

      <p>However, despite a less-than-stellar critical reception, State of Decay 2 still managed to draw the crowds, with Microsoft's most recent figures, announced in August, revealing the player base to be around 5 million strong. Its continued popularity has enabled Undead Labs to expand and improve on its rocky launch, so Edwin's initial reservations may no longer apply.</p>
      <p>Undead Labs is yet to announce a firm release date for State of Decay 2 on Steam, but it <i>has</i> <a href="https://www.stateofdecay.com/2019/11/22/state-of-decay-2-is-coming-to-steam/">confirmed</a> that Xbox Live cross-play will be supported, enabling up to four co-op pals to band together regardless of whether they're on Steam, Windows 10, or Xbox One.</p>
      <p>Additional details will be shared in a special livestream (on Mixer, Twitch, and YouTube) next Monday, 25th November, at 11pm UK time/3pm PT.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/495420/State_of_Decay_2/">State of Decay 2's Steam page</a> is now live, so do feel free to admire its soothing blue hues while Undead Labs prepares to reveal more.</p>
