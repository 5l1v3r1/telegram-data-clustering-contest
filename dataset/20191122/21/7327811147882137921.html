      <p>ELMHURST, Queens (WABC) -- Police responded to the Queens Center mall on Friday after a fight between hundreds of kids.</p>
      <p>Schools in the area had a half day of classes, and Eyewitness News has learned of rumors spread on Snapchat that there was going to be a large fight at the mall.</p>
      <p>Approximately 200 kids gathered at the shopping center, but no fight ever happened.</p>
      <p>Then, for an unknown reason, someone began throwing fake cash over a railing from an upper level, and a melee ensued as the teens scrambled to grab what they thought was real money.</p>
      <p>Authorities were called to the scene around 1 p.m. for crowd control and quickly cleared the area.</p>
      <p>No injuries were reported and the mall was not closed, but police encouraged the public to stay away from the scene while they assessed the situation.</p>

      <p>It does appear there were several fights outside the mall once the teens were evacuated, though it's not clear if that was related.</p>
      <p>It was not yet cleared if there were any injuries, but at least one person was taken into custody.</p>
      <p>No one under 18 was allowed to reenter the mall.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson from the mall released the following statement:</p>
      <p>
        <i>"We are disappointed by the actions of the teens in our community today and remain committed to providing a safe, enjoyable community destination for everyone."</i>
