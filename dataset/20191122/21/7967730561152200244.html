      <h1>Wall Street jumps as Trump says trade deal 'potentially very close'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:47:40+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:47</time> by <a rel="author">Sinead Carew</a></address>
      <p>Wall Street advanced on Friday as both Washington and Beijing made positive comments on the potential for a trade deal between the world's two biggest economies and upbeat domestic economic data helped to ease investor worries.</p>
      <p>US President Donald Trump told Fox News a trade deal was "potentially very close" following remarks by President Xi Jinping that Beijing wanted to work out an initial agreement.</p>

      <p>The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow showed their biggest daily gains in a lackluster week marked by uncertainty, with a report suggesting the delay of a trade truce to 2020 and US lawmakers passing two bills supporting protesters in Hong Kong, which could complicate US-China talks.</p>
      <p>Strategists said it helped that Trump was vague on Friday about whether he would sign or veto the bills.</p>
      <p>Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, attributed Friday's gains to strong US manufacturing data as well as the improving mood on trade. He said investors were cautious about the apparent trade progress, however.</p>
      <p>“President Trump saying it's close is news we’ve heard before. How close is close? Close but not quite or close but I could change my mind?" he said. "That’s what’s keeping the market on its heels at the moment, keeping the move a little bit more timid.”</p>
      <p>Manufacturing output accelerated in November to its fastest pace in seven months and services activity picked up more than expected.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 109.33 points, or 0.39 per cent, to 27,875.62, the S&amp;P 500 gained 6.75 points, or 0.22 per cent, to 3,110.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 13.67 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 8,519.89.</p>
      <p>Still, the S&amp;P snapped its six-week winning streak, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq registered its first weekly drop in eight weeks and the Dow showed a weekly loss after four weeks of gains. A largely better-than-expected third-quarter corporate earnings season contributed to recent rallies.</p>
      <p>Seven of the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors closed higher, led by a 0.76 per cent gain in financials and a 0.65 per cent rise in consumer discretionary.</p>
