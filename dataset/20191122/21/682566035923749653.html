      <p>Monaco - <b>World Athletics </b>announced on Friday that it had suspended the reinstatement process of Russian athletics and was contemplating expelling <b>Russia</b> entirely from the sport.</p>
      <p>The news comes a day after the president of the Russian athletics federation (RUSAF) and other senior officials were suspended for "serious breaches" of anti-doping rules, putting the nation's track and field athletes' participation at next year's Tokyo Olympics in further danger.</p>
      <p>The head of World Athletics Sebastian Coe described those banned as 'renegade factions'.</p>
      <p>"The people we were dealing with have all been suspended," said Coe, explaining why the process of potential reintegration had been suspended.</p>
      <p>The global governing body of athletics, formerly the IAAF, originally banned Russia for doping in November 2015.</p>
      <p>But Thursday's ruling by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) that accused RUSAF of obstructing an investigation into high-jumper Danil Lysenko, has deepened the crisis.</p>
      <p>After the first day of its council meeting in Monaco, the body said it was awaiting a decision by the World Anti-Doping Agency on December 9, but was considering expelling RUSAF and was also suspending the provision that allows Russians to compete as neutral athletes.</p>
