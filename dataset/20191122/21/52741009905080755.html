      <p>OSHAWA, Ont. — Police east of Toronto are investigating an alleged hit and run that left a cyclist dead early Friday.</p>
      <p>Durham regional police say a passing driver spotted the woman on the ground near an intersection in Oshawa, Ont., with her badly damaged bicycle nearby.</p>
      <p>They say many vehicles simply drove around the victim until one driver finally stopped and called police.</p>
      <p>Investigators have identified the victim as a 36-year-old woman, but are keeping her name private at her family's request.</p>
      <p>They say that as of 3 p.m. Friday — roughly 11 hours after the crash — no witnesses had come forward.</p>
      <p>Police have not provided a suspect description, but they say a portion of a headlight and a shattered piece of a bug deflector were left at the scene of the crash.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 22, 2019.</p>
