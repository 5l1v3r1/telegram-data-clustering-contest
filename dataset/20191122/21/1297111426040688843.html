      <p>Three people were sent to hospital after three semi trucks were involved in a collision on Highway 39 near the village of Roche Percee on Thursday.</p>
      <p>According to an RCMP news release, the crash happened at approximately 4:08 a.m. when a semi-truck travelling from North Portal jack knifed. Soon after, a second semi-truck driving southeast collided with the truck and split the trailer from the tractor.</p>
      <p>Minutes after the collision, a third semi-truck travelling southeast collided with the second truck, pushing it into a ditch. The third semi-truck then caught fire.</p>
      <p>All three drivers and a single passenger were quickly located. Two of the drivers and the passenger were transported to hospital in Estevan and released later that morning.</p>
      <p>Police said road conditions at the time were icy and rutted, and visibility was poor due to fog. The crash is still under investigation.</p>
      <p>Roche Percee is located approximately 19 kilometres southeast of Estevan.</p>
