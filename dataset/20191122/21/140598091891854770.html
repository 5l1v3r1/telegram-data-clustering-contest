      <p>Two people killed when a tree fell on their car in Gloucestershire are believed to be mother and daughter.</p>
      <p>The vehicle was on the B4077 at Stanway Hill, near the Cotswolds town of Winchcombe, on Thursday evening when the incident occurred.</p>
      <p>Gloucestershire Police said they were informed of the incident by the ambulance service at 10.15pm.</p>
      <p>Formal identification has not yet taken place but the victims are believed to be a 16-year-old girl and her 56-year-old mother.</p>
      <p>It is reportedly the second time that a tree has fallen across the road in less than six months.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Gloucestershire Police said: "Their next of kin has been informed.</p>
      <p>"The road remains closed north of Ford and at the Toddington roundabout while police are at the scene.</p>
      <p>"It is not yet known when the road will reopen and motorists are asked to find alternative routes."</p>
