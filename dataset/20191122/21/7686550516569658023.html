      <p>The four main party leaders faced questions from a BBC Question Time studio audience on Friday night.</p>
      <p>The leaders appeared on a special leaders' edition of the BBC panel show as part of build-up to the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election 2019.</a></p>
      <p>It comes <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/rate-jeremy-corbyn-boris-johnson-17279775">days after Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn</a> went head-to-head in their first leaders' debate of the campaign.</p>
      <p>This time, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson also took to the stage with the Labour and Conservative leaders.</p>
      <p>Each leader had 30 minutes each to answer questions from a studio audience in Sheffield.</p>
      <p>This is what you had to say about how they performed.</p>
