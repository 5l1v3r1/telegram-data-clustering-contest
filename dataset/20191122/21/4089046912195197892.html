      <p><b>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WVLT) --</b> An architectural firm announced it was designing Knoxville's first vertical-style condominium building, complete private elevators for each unit.</p>
      <p>Architects Wright said the building, called The Overlook, would come to downtown Knoxville by the end of summer 2020.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.knoxvilleoverlook.com/">The Overlook</a> condominiums boast a family style living concept by eliminating shared hallways and elevators and offering streetscape views.</p>
      <p>The developers of the project are also behind several notable buildings such as The Oliver Hotel, Hyatt Place Hotel, and Balter Beerworks.</p>
      <p>A realtor told WVLT News <a href="https://www.knoxvilleoverlook.com/">The Overlook</a> was already 80% full as of November 22, with limited units remaining.</p>
