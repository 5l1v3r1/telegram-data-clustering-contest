      <h1>Latest Turn in Case of Missing Woman: Ex-Boyfriend Dies in Suicide</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:57:37+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:57</time> by <a rel="author">Azi Paybarah</a></address>
      <p>John Ozbilgen was familiar to the authorities. He had been arrested twice for domestic violence since June. When the police came to his New Jersey home this month, it was to search his phone for possible clues about where his former girlfriend, who had vanished two days earlier, might be.</p>
      <p>What they found on the phone was child pornography, officials at the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office said. Mr. Ozbilgen was arrested and held in jail until being released on Tuesday pending trial.</p>
      <p>Early Friday, he was found dead at his home in Freehold, according to the prosecutor’s office. The county medical examiner ruled the death a suicide by hanging,<a href="https://www.facebook.com/MCProsecutors.Office/posts/2597880226961493?__xts__[0]=68.ARCx4UFkscARkqfdPU2s05dYAxb8vKLRzYVInrKCpJGMpViycoCCJ0m0NFRWLiNtRcLrFx9ag2k8gcQjEUeCXwbS9LCw6UZtzK7bFaFozyFVC8ZyoFd-XOCiG1nyJbDh7H35aS2E_btjC_whCkRdcpnnLWIlU4J3kAoL-VvYl_X19dK-hKGEHPUvmdYps58j2uvqI6CWQLiMM629D6nVLn_5_dbzo_8xIE5UvH5pnLgzuqExJocJO3vY7XnTDuFF1Y4vEKCW0kkL0olaiV2fHCd-x6C_Kj19mg0kiBbfgsbBKLe1H9B2UTL06FJZq7jIqsCrcN3WepD7v2XkuefvXA&amp;__tn__=-R"> the prosecutor’s office said</a>.</p>
      <p>It was the latest turn in a mystery surrounding what happened to Mr. Ozbilgen’s former girlfriend, Stephanie Parze, 25, whose disappearance has bedeviled law enforcement officials in two states for several weeks.</p>
      <p>Ms. Parze, a makeup artist and nanny, was last seen on Oct. 30, saying goodbye to family and friends after a night out in New Jersey. She sent her mother an image through Snapchat from the road that night.</p>
      <p>As Ms. Parze’s family and friends sought the public’s help in finding her, law enforcement officials appeared to be focusing their attention on Mr. Ozbilgen.</p>
      <p>In June, he was arrested in Freehold on domestic violence charges after grabbing a woman’s face and “pulling her hair and dragging her by her hair,” according to a criminal complaint. The woman’s identity has not been made public.</p>
      <p>On Sept. 22, Mr. Ozbilgen was arrested and accused of assaulting Ms. Parze, the complaint says. She told the police that he had attacked her after she tried to break up with him and that she was afraid he would abuse her again, the complaint says.</p>
      <p>In the September incident, the complaint says, Mr. Ozbilgen hit Ms. Parze on her hand and on the side of her head “using his backhand.” The assault left her with an injured thumb, the complaint says.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said that on Oct. 29, Mr. Ozbilgen sent Ms. Parze a series of angry messages that she did not answer, <a href="https://www.app.com/story/news/local/courts/2019/11/19/freehold-missing-woman-stephanie-parze-john-ozbilgen-free-from-jail/4205620002/">according to The Asbury Park Press</a>.</p>
      <p>She disappeared the next night.</p>
      <p>As part of the investigation into what happened to her, the police conducted a “forensic review” of Mr. Ozbilgen’s iPhone on Nov. 1, according to police records. After they found the child pornography, he was taken into custody and charged.</p>
      <p>Since Ms. Parze disappeared, law enforcement officials in New Jersey and New York have searched a large nature preserve in the southern part of Staten Island twice. The area is about 30 miles north of Ms. Parze’s home in Freehold.</p>
      <p>The police have not said publicly what led them to the park or what, if anything, the searches turned up. <a href="https://abc7ny.com/person-of-interest-identified-in-disappearance-of-nj-woman/5674452/">WABC-TV said</a> that cellphone records led investigators there.</p>
      <p>Ms. Parze’s father, Ed, said that his daughter’s home appeared undisturbed after she disappeared. Her car was in the driveway. Her phone and jacket were inside, as was her dog.</p>
      <p>“We don’t have any indication of any forced entry,” Mr. Parze told CNN. Her mother told WPIX, “The unknown kills you — not knowing where she is, what’s happening to her.”</p>
      <p>Ms. Parze’s family is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/brianna.parze/posts/3106934266001447">planning another search this weekend.</a></p>
