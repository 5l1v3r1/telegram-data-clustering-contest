      <p>We’re 12 games into the current Premier League season, and right now it looks like <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/liverpool">Liverpool</a> could be closing in on their first ever title. The Reds lead the table with a total of 34 points – 8 clear of second-placed Leicester City – and have yet to lose a game thus far.</p>
      <p>In fact, the only points that Jurgen Klopp’s side have dropped came in their October draw with <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/manchester-united">Manchester United</a> at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>So can anyone stop Liverpool? Or are they already the uncrowned champions of 2019-20?</p>
      <p>Right now it’s tempting to suggest the league will be theirs come May, but in all honesty, that’d be a premature call to make. Bigger points gaps have been overhauled before – and there’s still plenty of time for the Reds to slip up.</p>
      <p>Here are three upcoming fixtures that could cause Liverpool to slip up in their quest for the Premier League title.</p>
      <h4>#1 Leicester City vs Liverpool – 26/12/2019</h4>

      <p>The Christmas period is always tricky for any side, due to the crowded fixture list that tends to see teams playing multiple fixtures across a short time. But Liverpool’s visit to Leicester City on Boxing Day should probably give Reds fans even more worries than normal.</p>
      <p>Firstly there’s the issue of Leicester’s general form; under former Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, the Foxes look more dangerous than ever. They currently sit 8 points behind the Reds in second, but have a superior goal difference, having scored one more and conceded two fewer. The likes of Jamie Vardy, James Maddison and Youri Tielemans are in the form of their lives right now.</p>
      <p>But Liverpool don’t just have Leicester to contend with. Just eight days before their fixture at the King Power Stadium, Jurgen Klopp’s men will face an opponent to be determined in Qatar in the semi-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup.</p>
      <p>Win that game, and the Reds will face another opponent in the final on 22 December – and then travel back for their Boxing Day clash with the Foxes.</p>
      <p>Add in the fact that Liverpool also play Aston Villa in the EFL Cup on 17 December – a day before they travel to Qatar – and it’s safe to say their squad will be stretched to its limits.</p>
