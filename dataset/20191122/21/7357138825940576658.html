      <p>Facebook Pay is a tool to take all the <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/exclusive-series/monday-meetup/2019/paypal-on-facebook-pay-and-the-power-of-consumer-choice/">commerce</a> already happening in its marketplace, on Instagram and so forth and make it easier for consumers to quickly pay from within the application in lieu of moving offsite to finish a deal. The mechanism for this is a single sign-on functionality highly reminiscent of Google Pay.</p>

      <p>Lawyer George Isaacson argued Wayfair’s side in the historic 2018 <i>South Dakota v. Wayfair</i> case.

      <p>In a feature story, Isaacson explains how this disparate tax landscape favors overseas sellers compared to domestic, what the chances are for federal eCommerce tax legislation and why more states are refraining from simplifying their tax codes.</p>

          <b>Can AI Solve Home Sharing’s Fake Listings Problem?</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>Online platforms have to ensure that product listings on their sites are properly verified, as the fallout from failing to do so even once can have devastating effects. This is particularly the case for facilitators of products or services, such as <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/payments-innovation/2019/can-ai-solve-home-sharings-fake-listings-problem">homesharing rentals</a>, where potential buyers could be stranded in an unfamiliar city in the case of a false listing, or sellers could be cheated out of potential revenue.</p>
      <p>Managing the isolation and removal of these false listings is key to user trust, according to Chung-Man Tam, CEO of P2P business travel booking site <a href="https://www.2ndaddress.com/">2nd Address</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Trying on clothes in the store can truly be an experience of fashion out of context — a problem that MIT graduate Salvador Nissi Vilcovsky decided to formally tackle 2013 when he along with MemoMi Co-Founder Ofer Saban launched a product that had heretofore never been seen in the market: a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2019/magic-mirror-on-the-wall-is-ar-the-innovation-for-retailers-all/">smart mirror</a>.</p>

      <p>Part of the impetus comes from the fact that sports betting is legal in 19 states, though mobile betting is only allowed in 13 of them.</p>
