      <h1>Biden fumes at Graham over request for documents on son; Giuliani blasts 'threat to a US Senator'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:21:16+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:21</time> by <a rel="author">Charles Creitz</a></address>
      <p>Former Vice President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> said Friday he is "embarrassed" for his former Senate colleague <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/lindsey-graham">Lindsey Graham</a>, R-S.C., over his request for documents pertaining to Hunter Biden and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</p>
      <p>But Biden's further remarks about Graham drew a response on Twitter from Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who wrote that Biden's comments amounted to "a threat to a US Senator," and reminded the former federal prosecutor of "my old mafia cases."</p>
      <p>During an interview with CNN's Don Lemon, Biden also criticized President Trump, claiming Graham cannot break with the president for fear of losing his Senate seat in 2020.</p>

      <p>Lemon told Biden that Graham once called him the "nicest person" and recalled how the two worked together for many years.</p>
      <p>After a pause, Biden turned to Lemon and said, "They're asking Lindsey Graham. They have him under their thumb right now. They know he knows if he comes out against Trump he’s got a real tough road for reelection."</p>

      <p>On Thursday, Graham -- the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee -- sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting the release of any documents related to contacts between Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.</p>
      <p>Graham’s letter, which was released as the final day of public hearings in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">House impeachment inquiry</a> into Trump wrapped up, asked Pompeo to release a series of documents and transcripts of conversations in 2016 between Biden and Poroshenko in relation to an investigation into the Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma Holdings.</p>
      <p>Burisma – specifically, Hunter Biden’s role on the company’s board of directors – has become one of the main talking points from Trump and the Republicans amid the impeachment inquiry into the president.</p>
      <p>In his interview with CNN, Biden said he is "quite frankly... angered" by Graham's move.</p>

      <p>"He knows me. He knows my son. He knows there's nothing to this," the former Delaware senator said.</p>
      <p>He claimed Trump is "essentially holding power over him [Graham] that even the Ukrainians wouldn't yield to."</p>
      <p>"Lindsey is about to go down in a way that I think he's going to regret his whole life," he said, going on to address Graham directly: "Lindsey... I'm just embarrassed by what you're doing -- for you -- I mean, my Lord."</p>

      <p>Giuliani, the president's lawyer, tweeted Friday that Biden's remarks constituted "a threat to a US Senator."</p>
      <p>"This is getting to be more and more like my old mafia cases," Giuliani added. "They sure do sound like crooks."</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, former South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lindsey-graham-challenger-jaime-harrison">announced he would challenge</a> the three-term Graham in the 2020 election.</p>
      <p>Prior to his election to the U.S. Senate, Graham served as a U.S. congressman from upstate South Carolina and played a key role as "manager" during the House of Representatives' Clinton impeachment investigation.</p>
