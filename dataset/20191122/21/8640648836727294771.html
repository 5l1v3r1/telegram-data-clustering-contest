      <p>A Minnesota man was arrested Thursday in the death of his girlfriend in Mohave County, Arizona.</p>
      <p>The Mohave County Sheriff’s Office said Daniel Joseph Campbell, 55, of Rochester, Minnesota, was arrested on a charge of second-degree murder in the slaying of Johanna Berg, 40, also of Rochester.</p>
      <p>The sheriff’s office said in a press release that they were contacted by a witness Wednesday who said they’d received a call from Campbell. The caller quoted Campbell as saying that Berg had overdosed on narcotics in the Fort Mohave area as the couple traveled across the country.</p>
      <p>Deputies performed a welfare check on Berg in the area of Boundary Cone Road and Highway 95 in Fort Mohave and found Berg deceased in a vehicle. Campbell told authorities Berg had recently purchased illegal drugs and overdosed.</p>
      <p>But authorities said an autopsy revealed Berg was beaten and strangled. Campbell was arrested Thursday at a hotel in Bullhead City, Arizona.</p>
