      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:29:04+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/lgiesbrechtpostmedia" target="_blank">Lynn Giesbrecht</a></address>
      <p>With Christmas a mere month away, many organizations across the Queen City are launching their holiday campaigns to collect donations for people in need in Regina. Here are a few campaigns looking for donations:</p>
      <h3>The Eagle Heart Centre</h3>
      <p>Delora Parisian, executive director of the <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/eagle-heart-centre-expansion-to-give-more-families-a-taste-of-home">Eagle Heart Centre</a>, started the Legacy Campaign three years ago when she realized many of the 700 families the centre works with did not have the budget for doing activities together as a family.</p>
      <p>“What they were lacking were life experiences,” said Parisian. “When I look back on my life, we had Christmas and I don’t remember all the toys I got, but I sure do remember the memories of family and fun and doing things together, and so I wanted to pass that on.”</p>
      <p>These experiences could be anything from movie tickets to restaurant gift cards to passes for the Saskatchewan Science Centre or a local museum. Eagle Heart Centre will accept donations for the campaign up until Dec. 20. Donations can be dropped off in person at Eagle Heart Centre or monetary donations can be made online at <a href="https://www.afscregina.ca/">www.afscregina.ca</a>.</p>
      <h3>Regina Food Bank</h3>
      <p>With the task of putting together an estimated 2,500 food hampers ahead, the <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/food-bank-usage-still-high-in-sask-hungercount-by-the-numbers">Regina Food Bank</a> is accepting donations for its annual Hampers of Hope campaign.</p>
      <p>John Bailey, CEO of the Regina Food Bank, said $75 gives a family a hamper with food for a full breakfast and Christmas dinner. Currently the organization has enough money for around 500 Christmas hampers. Monetary donations for the Christmas hampers can be made with a credit card by calling the Regina Food Bank or <a href="https://reginafoodbank.ca/">online at reginafoodbank.ca</a>.</p>
      <p>But while the organization is putting together its Christmas hampers, Bailey said the food bank is still giving out its regular food hampers throughout the holiday season and could always use more donations of non-perishable food items to keep those stocked. People can donate non-perishable food items at their local grocery store or the food bank at 425-445 Winnipeg Street.</p>
      <h3>Regina Christmas Wish List</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/regina-churchs-christmas-wish-list-makes-charitable-giving-personal">Working with several local non-profit organizations, the Glen Elm Church of Christ puts together a list of people in need of a Christmas gift every year, ranging from students to newcomers to Canada to seniors. A short story about every person is included to give a sense of who they are and what they need.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Pastor Jason Bandura with the Glen Elm Church of Christ anticipates around 500 gift requests will need filling this year.</p>
      <p>“I’m amazed how many people read a story and comment like, ‘If I was born in a different place, I could be that guy,’” he said. “I think the stories are powerful in generating compassion. I think they wake up a sense of empathy in us and even a sense of understanding.”</p>
      <p>People interested in participating can choose a person they would like to buy gifts for at <a href="https://reginachristmaswishlist.com/">reginachristmaswishlist.com</a>. By filling in your contact information and hitting “Complete,” you can pledge to purchase gifts for the person you chose. Donations need to be dropped off at the Glen Elm Church of Christ by Dec. 19.</p>
      <h3>The Salvation Army</h3>
      <p>Thursday marked the beginning of the 2019 Christmas Kettle Campaign in Regina, which is the Salvation Army Regina Haven of Hope’s largest public fundraiser of the year. Donations made allow the organization to help the less fortunate in the Queen City through the Christmas Hamper and Adopt a Family programs, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/salvation-army-backpack-program-helps-get-kids-to-school">along with other programs throughout the year.</a></p>
      <p>In 2018, the Regina Kettle Campaign raised more than $213,000, and this year the organization hopes to raise the bar to $215,000.</p>
      <p>The familiar kettles will be in 14 store locations across the city from Nov. 22 to Dec. 24. While always accepting of cash or cheque donations, many kettle locations can now also accept donations by debit or credit card.</p>
      <p>In partnership with 980 CJME, toy barrels can also once again be found in stores across the Queen City for the Santas Anonymous campaign.</p>
      <p>Donations of new, unwrapped toys are accepted, with donations for toddlers and children ages nine to 12 usually needed most. According to 980 CJME, 50,000 toys have been given out over the last 50 years.</p>
      <h3>Regina Leader-Post Cheer Fund</h3>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/christmas-cheer-funds-are-crucial-to-four-womens-shelters">The Regina Leader-Post’s annual Cheer Fund campaign launches on Nov. 30, with all money raised going to Regina Transition House, SOFIA House, WISH Safe House and the YWCA Regina’s Isabel Johnson Shelter.</a> These shelters all help women and children fleeing domestic violence.</p>
      <p>In 2018, the Cheer Fund raised $91,016, which was distributed evenly among the shelters. Watch for details on how to make a donation coming out Nov. 30.</p>
