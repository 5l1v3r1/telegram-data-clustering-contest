      <h1>Miley Cyrus and Cody Simpson's relationship 'is easy' because 'they live apart'</h1>
      <h2>The Wrecking Ball hitmaker and the Australian hunk live separate lives which works for them</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:40:35+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:40</time> by <a rel="author">Sara-Aisha Kent, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sara-aisha-kent/</a></address>
      <p>Miley Cyrus, 26, and Cody Simpson, 22, may only have been dating since October but the couple have decided that "having separate lives" and living in different states works for their blossoming relationship.</p>
      <p>The couple, who have recently been plagued by split rumours - that Australian Cody squashed when he inadvertently revealed that his screen saver was a snap of Miley as a child on his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> stories - have decided that being their own people makes their coupling "easy."</p>
      <p>"Miley and Cody have their separate lives. Cody had to stay in LA but has visited Miley in Tennesse," a source told People.</p>

      <p>They added: "They have a very easy relationship. They see each other when they can, and when they are apart, things are good too. This works for both of them.''</p>
      <p>Musician Cody recently revealed he has had a crush on Miley since he was just 12 years old.</p>
      <p>The loved-up couple were just friends for a decade as she was in an on-off relationship with Australian actor Liam Hemsworth who later became her husband.</p>

      <p>But following their divorce after just six-months of marriage, Miley and Cody finally got together.</p>
      <p>Miley had a brief fling with Kaitlyn Carter before hooking up with Cody.</p>
      <p>A newly resurfaced video from 2012 has proved that teen sensation Cody has always had feelings for the Hannah Montana star.</p>

      <p>Cody was at a star-studded launch of Tiffany &amp; Co. Mens line in Los Angeles on Friday, when he told <a href="https://people.com/music/cody-simpson-talks-relationship-miley-cyrus-we-just-have-ball/">People</a> : "The reason why it hasn't been a really crazy sudden thing is just because weâ€™ve been friends for so long."</p>
      <p>Miley and Cody both recently announced that they reached four-months of sobriety - Cody has ditched the booze but revealed he is "still stoned" on his Instagram stories.</p>
