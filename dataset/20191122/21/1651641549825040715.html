      <h1>Does the Apple Airpods Pro have better sound quality than the Samsung Galaxy Buds? Consumer Reports reveals the answer.</h1>

      <p>As the holiday season approaches, many of us may be considering whether to gift<a href="https://mspoweruser.com/apple-airpods-pro-discount/"> Apple Airpods Pro</a> to a loved one this Christmas. The truly wireless earphones are being sold on their much-improved sound quality compared to the older Airpods, and while due to the very open design of the original Airpods this is very true, there is an impression that Airpods Pro has the best in class sound quality, especially compared to cheaper competitors such as the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-announce-the-samsung-galaxy-buds-truly-wireless-headphones/">Samsung Galaxy Buds</a>.  The question is, therefore, if we place the Apple Airpods Pro vs the Samsung Galaxy Buds, which one will sound better.</p>
      <p>Thankfully independent comparison company Consumer Reports has already addressed the question, and their conclusion may surprise you.</p>
      <p>Consumer Reports found that the AirPods Pro exceeds previous models with enhanced audio quality, but that the Samsung Galaxy Buds offered a more high-end experience.</p>
      <p>“The Echo Buds, Amazon’s new noise-cancelling true wireless headphones, didn’t score quite as well in our tests, but they’re solid performers and far cheaper at $130,” <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/headphones/apple-airpods-pro-earphones-review/">Consumer Reports said.</a> “And while the AirPods Pro sound far better than Apple’s earlier models, they still don’t meet the audio quality of our top pick for true wireless sound, the Samsung Galaxy Buds, which also sell for around $130.”</p>
      <p>They also did not like the fit much, saying the silicone tip made their ears feel “plugged up,” but at least Apple includes three sizes to figure out an appropriate fit.</p>
      <p>They did laud Apple for their above-average audio quality, active noise cancellation, and a transparency mode.</p>
      <p>Interestingly in a recent head to head review of the Apple Airpods Pro vs the Samsung Galaxy Buds YouTube channel Shane Symonds offers much the same conclusion, which is an interesting contrast to some larger review sites which seems to give Apple extra points for just being Apple.</p>

      <p>Of course when gift-giving sound quality may not be your first criteria, so this information may be more useful if you are buying for yourself.</p>
      <p>Either way, you can pick up a set of Samsung Galaxy Buds for <a href="https://amzn.to/35BFL23">only $115.95 here</a>, and Apple Airpods Pro for <a href="https://amzn.to/2N75skp">$235.99 here</a>.</p>
