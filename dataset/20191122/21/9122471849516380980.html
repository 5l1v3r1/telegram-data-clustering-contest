      <h1>Ohio State Insider Announces College GameDay Guest Picker</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:56:51+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>ESPN’s <i>College GameDay </i>is headed to Columbus this weekend for arguably the biggest game of the weekend.</p>
      <p>No. 2 Ohio State hosts No. 8 Penn State in a battle of potential College Football Playoff contenders. The winner of Saturday afternoon’s game will take a stranglehold on the Big Ten and likely represent the Big Ten East in the conference’s title game.</p>
      <p>Before the weekend’s slate of games can begin, though, Kirk Herbstreit and company will break down all of the action. Helping with those duties every Saturday morning is a person with a special bond to the place GameDay broadcasts from.</p>
      <p>This weekend, that honor goes to one of the best running backs in Ohio State history: Eddie George.</p>
      <p>Ohio State insider Dan Hope revealed the news.</p>
      <p>“Former Ohio State RB Eddie George, a Philadelphia native who chose OSU after Penn State recruited him as an LB, will be the guest picker for ESPN’s College GameDay,” Hope said.</p>

      <p>George starred for the Buckeyes in college, winning the Heisman Trophy in 1995.</p>
      <p>He went on to an illustrious NFL career with the Tennessee Titans where he was a four-time Pro Bowler. Now he’ll be back on campus to watch his Buckeyes face off against the Nittany Lions.</p>
      <p>Ohio State and Penn State kick off at 12:00 p.m. ET on FOX.</p>
