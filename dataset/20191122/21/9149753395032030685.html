      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:26:01+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/alice-newcome-beill/" target="_blank">Alice Newcome-Beill</a></address>
      <p>Alienware is a name that's synonymous with high-end PCs, and while these machines can often be quite expensive, <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/gamingpcs?ref=p13n_hpr_gamer_hero_1_cta_1">Dell is offering steep discounts on many of its Alienware laptops leading up to Black Friday</a>, letting you save as much as $480 on some of these extraterrestrial laptops. There are nine different laptops on sale right now, but we're going to walk you through a few of our top picks and why we think they're the best bang for your buck.</p>
      <p>The featherweight entry in this lineup is still no slouch when it comes to performance. The <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/productdetail/3il0">Alienware M15 is available for $1,079 ($350 off)</a> and is an excellent mid-range laptop that's ideal for 1080p gaming. Featuring a GTX 1060 and an i7-8750H processor, this machine is perfect for games that aren't terribly demanding of your hardware. While you may have some issues running something like Apex Legends at max quality on a machine of this caliber, these specs are well suited to games like Fortnite or Rainbow Six: Siege. The M15 also features 1TB of storage in addition to a 128GB SSD, with 16GB of DDR4 RAM.</p>
      <p>Next up is the <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/productdetail/3bym">Alienware M17, available for $1,699 ($250 off)</a>. A slightly larger and more powerful version of the M15, this laptop represents an major jump in performance. These models are aesthetically similar, but their hardware is a generation apart. Featuring an RTX 2060 paired with an i7-9750H CPU, this laptop is capable of pushing well past 60FPS on its 17-inch 1080p display. The M17 also includes a 256GB SSD and 16GB of RAM. While it's substantially wider than the M15 to accommodate the larger display, the M17 still remains relatively portable, at a slim .7-inches thick and weighing in at just under six pounds.   </p>
      <p>The cream of the crop for our Alienware deals selection is the <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/productdetail/3bys">Area-51m gaming laptop, available for $2,699 ($400 off)</a>. While there's no denying the high price tag, you get what you pay for in terms of performance as this machine ranks among some of the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-laptop/">best gaming laptops</a> available. Packing in an i7-9700K overclockable CPU and an RTX 2070, the Area-51m is ready for whatever you happen to throw at it. A 256GB SSD, 1 TB of additional storage, and 16GB of RAM round out the specs on of this 17-inch, 1080p laptop. You can take the Area-51m with you, so long as you aren't in a hurry. Easily the heaviest Alienware laptop right now at almost nine pounds, the M17 also features a large and weighty AC adapter making it a bit burdensome to port around, depending on where you need to take it. </p>

      <p>The otherworldy form factor may not appeal to everyone, and the included 1-year warranty that comes standard with all of these models is a bit underwhelming for a premium laptop. All of the models offered during this sale can also be upgraded if you need some additional power.
