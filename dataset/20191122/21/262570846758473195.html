      <p>HARARE (Reuters) - Dubai-based Albwardy Investments said on Friday it would buy Zimbabwe’s Meikles Hotel for $20 million and would upgrade what is one of the southern African nation’s most well-known establishments.</p>
      <p>The current owner, Meikles Limited, has over the past few years struggled with low occupancy levels and has lacked foreign exchange to refurbish the property in Harare.</p>
      <p>Albwardy said the investment had been approved by Zimbabwe’s stock exchange and competition commission, while the shareholders would vote on the transaction next month.</p>
      <p>“The Meikles Hotel provides a unique opportunity to invest in Zimbabwe’s leisure and business markets as a first mover,” Albwardy director of hospitality Laurie Ward said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Albwardy is expected to spend up to $30 million in upgrading the hotel, an official from Meikles Hotel told Reuters.</p>
      <p>The hotel, which was established in 1915, has 312 rooms. (Reporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Edmund Blair)</p>
