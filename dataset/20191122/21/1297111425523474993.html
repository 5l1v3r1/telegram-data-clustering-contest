      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:41:40+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/jackerman55" target="_blank">Jennifer Ackerman</a></address>
      <p>A recent issue of improper disposal of two deer carcasses shows a lack of respect for the public image of hunting, says the executive director of the Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation (SWF).</p>
      <p>“The public perception of hunting is always scarred a little bit when people are not being responsible and doing the right thing,” Darrell Crabbe of the SWF said in an interview this week. “That’s always an unfortunate byproduct of that type of activity.”</p>
      <p>Provincial conservation officers looked into the issue after a concerned resident reported two harvested deer carcasses that appeared to be dumped on the side of the road near the Comfort Plus Campground northeast of White City on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment says it was not a poaching issue, nor an issue of waste of game, but an issue of improper disposal because they did not get permission from the landowners to discard the carcasses.</p>
      <p>“We remind hunters to take proper measures when disposing of carcass waste,” said the ministry in an emailed statement. </p>
      <p>Crabbe said there are a variety of ways a hunter can properly dispose of carcass once it’s been harvested, including taking the remains to the landfill, or (with permission from the landowner) take them to a field or coulee where predators will “clean them up.”</p>
      <p>Hunters are also being encouraged by the Ministry of Environment to debone the animal and leave the carcass in the location where it was harvested, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/that-would-be-the-end-of-our-industry-outfitters-defend-baiting-amid-calls-for-ban-in-sask">all in an effort to stop the spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD).</a></p>
      <p>“Most hunters are safe and law abiding, unfortunately, this type of thing does happen,” said the ministry about the incident. “Every year, we get several calls similar to this one.”</p>
      <p>Crabbe said he doesn’t see it as a rampant issue in Saskatchewan, but it is unfortunate when it happens because it violates the high level of ethics taught in hunter safety training.</p>
      <p>He couldn’t say exactly what might motivate someone to improperly dispose of a carcass, but speculated it may be out of laziness or simply just being irresponsible.</p>
      <p>“It would be no different than throwing out a bag of garbage in a ditch somewhere. (It’s) unacceptable and really irresponsible,” said Crabbe. “It’s sad that some individuals are like that.”</p>
      <p>He encourages all hunters to be responsible and dispose of harvested animals in an acceptable manner that doesn’t infringe on anyone.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t take much to break them down and bundle them up correctly and dispose of them at a landfill,” he said. “In the big picture of things that’s not a whole bunch of work.”</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Environment has a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week TIPP service if you notice any fishing, wildlife or environmental resource violations.</p>
      <p>Anyone can report and all calls and submissions are confidential (you do not have to give your name). Call 1-800-667-7562 to report.</p>
