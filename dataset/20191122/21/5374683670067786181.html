      <h2>Trump says Pence is "our man 100 percent" and will be his running mate again in 2020.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:45:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:45</time> by <a rel="author">Arutz Sheva North America Staff</a></address>
      <p>US President Donald Trump on Friday dismissed rumors that he may make a change in his running mate for the 2020 election and gave a vote of confidence to Vice President Mike Pence.</p>
      <p>In an interview on <i>Fox News</i>, Trump was asked about rumors that former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley might replace Pence as his running mate in the next election.</p>
      <p>"Mike Pence — I know I’ve seen this rumor that keeps popping up, and Nikki would be great, but Mike Pence has done a phenomenal job as vice president. He’s our guy, he’s my friend, and look, we have a great team," Trump replied.</p>
      <p>"Mike Pence is a great vice president," he added. "He’s our man 100 percent."</p>
      <p>Trump described Haley as a friend and said she will be involved in the campaign in some form.</p>
      <p>In August, <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/267590">Trump confirmed</a> he would keep Pence as his running mate when he seeks re-election in November 2020.</p>
      <p>“I’m very happy with Mike Pence. I think Mike Pence has been an outstanding VP. I think that he's been incredible in terms of the love that a lot of people -- especially if you look at the Evangelicals and so many others, they really have a great respect for our Vice President. And so do I. And so do, I think, most people,” he said at the time.</p>
      <p>Last November, <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/254427">Trump asked Pence</a> to be his running mate in 2020 in an impromptu exchange during a press conference in the White House.</p>
      <p>"Well I haven’t asked him, but I hope so," Trump said when asked by a reporter if he would be willing to lock in Pence as his running mate for 2020.</p>
      <p>"Where are you?" Trump asked as he looked around the East Room. Pence, who was sitting to Trump's left, waved.</p>
      <p>"Mike, will you be my running mate? Stand up, Mike, please. Raise your right hand. No, I’m only kidding," he continued.</p>
      <p>Pence then nodded his head in affirmation as some White House staff in the room applauded.</p>
      <p>"Will you? Thank you. OK, good," Trump said. "The answer is 'yes.'"</p>
