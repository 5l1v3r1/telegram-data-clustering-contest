      <h1>Sgt. Duke’s wife (his real-life sweetheart) returns to ‘Hawaii Five-0’</h1>

      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - A familiar face returns to the screen in Friday night’s episode of “Hawaii Five-0.”</p>
      <p>Hawaii actress and artist Laura Mellow is back as Sgt. Duke Lukela’s wife ― Nalani.</p>
      <p>Something you might not know: For much of her life, Mellow battled epilepsy. Daily seizures started when she was 8 years old.</p>
      <p>And medications didn’t help.</p>
      <p>In 2005, though, she had two operations at Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix. She has not had a single seizure since.</p>
      <p>She’s talking about her experiences in November for National Epilepsy Awareness Month.</p>
      <p>It’s easy for Mellow to play Lukela’s better half. She and actor Dennis Chun are longtime sweethearts.</p>
      <p>Catch “Hawaii Five-0” on Friday at 7 p.m. on KGMB.</p>
