      <p>What has me really excited about building websites is largely around <i>design systems</i> and the design tools we use to build them. Though, design systems are certainly not limited to websites.</p>
      <h3>Closing the Gap</h3>
      <p>In the <i>ever-so-hot-right-now</i> world of design systems, one of the most common phrases people use is "<b>bridging the gap</b>" (between designers and engineers). This was on several résumés I reviewed during my time at Salesforce when we were hiring for the Lightning Design System team. It's a fair endeavor to strive for, as we want to bring alignment, coherence, and unity to our product design and engineering — all with the goal of having a quality-consistent experience for the people using our products and services.</p>
      <p>However, "bridging the gap" still implies there <i>is</i> a gap. Why is that gap there in the first place? Is it due to many years of legacy process and workflows that still seep into our day to day work? I could see legacy being a real-world scenario need to work through. But what about newer, smaller startups? Why do many of them have a gap, too?</p>
      <p>As a design systems practitioner, advocate, and enthusiast, I am always seeking ways to improve the people side of our work: how we meet and communicate, how we prioritize our roadmap, and how we can iterate on our process and way of working. However, another piece of this are <b>the tools we use</b>.</p>
      <p>Some of our tools have come quite a long way, and it certainly seems that a new one is announced pretty frequently these days. But the ones that really get me excited are where I see them do <i>more</i> than "bridge the gap".</p>
      <p>A while back, when <a href="https://www.modulz.app/">Modulz</a> arrived at the scene, I noticed they used the hashtag, <b>#closethegap</b>. I couldn't help but love that.</p>

      <p>I'm very keen to see our design tools move away from simply bridging gaps and more toward closing them. For example, a feature I see as only <b>bridging</b> the gap is a "developer handoff" (which tends to rely on pixel dimensions and hex codes delivered as a spec). In my experience, delivering specs like this can promote duplication in code, inconsistencies, and are prone to errors. An example of <b>closing</b> the gap, however, are tools that work with actual, real, quality code instead of vector boxes.</p>
      <p>Some tools achieve this by exposing <a href="https://css-tricks.com/what-are-design-tokens/">design tokens</a> — you can see that in InVision DSM which has tokens built-in as a feature. Another tool, <a href="https://diez.org/">Diez</a>, is an open-source developer toolkit using tokens to turn your design language into scalable code. There are other tools like the previously mentioned Modulz, along with <a href="https://interplayapp.com/">Interplay</a>, that work with coded components but in a visual way. This is much better than the earlier WYSIWYG editors of the past because their generated code can be accessible and production-quality. And that’s not to leave out the other players in this space like <a href="https://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>, <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>, <a href="https://www.framer.com/">Framer</a>, <a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a>, <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/">UXPin</a>, and many, many more that are also doing a lot to move this forward.</p>
      <h3>The Invisible Design System</h3>
      <p>Something I've been thinking a lot about is how much time we spend on making beautiful design system websites. I love looking at them. They're great. But as our design and engineering tools get closer and closer together, will we come to a point where we don't need the website? Can our tools surface suggestions for better accessibility, localization, performance, and usability, because our design system is baked into the tools? <i>Just a thought</i>.</p>
      <h3>The No-Code Movement</h3>
      <p><a href="https://webflow.com/">Webflow</a>, which empowers people to build websites (complete with business and e-commerce features) without writing code, recently had a conference called <a href="https://webflow.com/nocodeconf">No Code Conf</a>. According to their website, the conference celebrates the future of visual development.</p>
      <p>This is a movement that, while not new, is growing rapidly. In addition to building a full-featured website using Webflow, visual, declarative app-building has been explored for years at larger tech giants like Salesforce (with their <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/video/193045/">Lightning App Builder</a>) to smaller companies like <a href="https://www.glideapps.com/">Glide</a> which let you generate an entire app from a spreadsheet. And with all of the task-based automation services such as <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> and <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>, there is much you can do without writing code at all.</p>
      <p>Now don't get me wrong. I still love writing code, and I <i>love</i> seeing other designers code. I enjoy working closely with engineers as well. I'm not saying we shouldn't code at all. But I'm excited to see us move away from a slower "throw designs over a wall" process. I want to see people able to make things without the <b>requirement</b> to write code. It will also be nice to move away from the tired argument on whether designers should code — and we all move toward <b>what can we make together?</b></p>
      <p>And if we can get to a point where we don't need to bridge or close any gaps because the gap never existed at all — well that's a pretty exciting world I want to be in.</p>
