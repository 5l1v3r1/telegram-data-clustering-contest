            <b>HB-W vs AS-W Dream11 : It will be Adelaide Strikers who will lock horns against the Hobart Hurricanes in the 45<sup>th</sup> match of Women’s Big Bash League.</b>
          </p>
          <p>While Adelaide Strikers have played some exceptional cricket in the tournament which has helped them surge to the 2<sup>nd</sup> position in the points table, Hobart Hurricanes had an indifferent tournament so far. They managed to win their previous clash against the Sydney Sixers but are still languishing at the bottom of the points table with 7 points from 11 games.</p>
          <p>Hobart Hurricanes need to win majority of their remaining match to harbour hopes of going through to the last 4. On the flip side, Adelaide Strikers have an opportunity to surge to the top position if they manage to beat Hobart. They will start as favourites but in T20 cricket nothing can be predicted as Hobart will look to replicate their performance against Sydney.</p>

                <h3>Match Conditions and Toss</h3>
                <p>This will be only the 2<sup>nd</sup> match of the tournament to be played at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart. In the earlier match of the tournament between Hurricane and Brisbane Heat, it was the latter who managed to defend a competitive score of 157 set up by Hobart. It is expected to be much of the same. The team winning the toss might look to defend given the anonymity of this surface.</p>
