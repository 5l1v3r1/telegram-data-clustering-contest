      <h1>Accra Technical University holds matriculation for 7000 students </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T21:22:18+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 21:22</time> by <a rel="author">Eunice Hilda Ampomah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov.22, GNA – Professor Samuel Nii Odai, the Vice Chancellor of the Accra Technical University (ATU) has advised students to desist from premarital sex to get peaceful and stable minds to study.</p>
      <p>“You can consult a lecturer for an advice when you have a problem, but make sure to report anyone who tries to take advantage of you. Premarital sex can destroy you, destroy your mental capacity and make you walk like a zombie.”</p>
      <p>Prof. Odai gave the advice at the matriculation ceremony on Friday for 7000 fresh students admitted by the University for the 2019/20 academic year.</p>
      <p>He said the students were on Campus to study and so they must focus on that and avoid being distracted by other less important issues.</p>
      <p>“The bottom line is you are here to study and not to cook for men, embrace men, nor to satisfy anyone’s emotional needs…. “</p>
      <p>Prof. Odai, therefore, urged students not to condone any acts of sexual harassments from their lecturers, by reporting them to the heads of their departments for appropriate measures to be taken.</p>
      <p>He said the ATU would not tolerate misconducts such as examination malpractices, occultism, prostitution and drug abuse.</p>
      <p>He said matriculation could be compared to traditional apprenticeship, where the apprentices stayed at the feet of their masters to learn, and become independent.</p>
      <p>The Vice Chancellor advised the students to emulate such good characters and graduate successfully to enable the University to celebrate their success.</p>
      <p>He said the University had only two hostels, which were inadequate for the student population, however, the Authorities were working to secure a land to put up additional accommodation structure for them.</p>
      <p>“Due to that, we have partnered with Ayalolo to convey students who cannot be residents to their various destinations within Accra, Tema, Kasoa and others,” he added.</p>
      <p>The ATU for the 2019/20 academic year admitted 7000 students, the biggest number ever, to offer courses in its five Faculties - Engineering, Applied Sciences, Built Environment, Applied Arts and Business.</p>
      <p>“Students admitted would be equipped with academic knowledge, field work, and hands-on-skills to prepare them for a lucrative career,” he added.</p>
