      <p>Tensions within the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> camp are starting to rise – and it’s mainly over the food (or lack of it).</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> was voted to do the bushtucker trial on Friday night’s show and she chose <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/myles-stephenson/">Myles Stephenson</a> to do it with her – although they both ended up in the ‘bad camp’.</p>
      <p>The duo won six stars for their evening meal – but they had to decide whether to have the food for their camp or the main camp – and they obviously chose their camp.</p>
      <p>Myles was upbeat as he exclaimed: ‘Don’t worry we’ve got six stars and we’ve done it fair and square. We’ll be thinking of main camp whilst we’re eating though for sure.’</p>
      <p>They approached the jungle jail where the other campmates were snoozing and they snuck in.</p>
      <p>‘It’s mixed emotions. Smashed the Trial happiness, gutted to leave the others. It’s like being at the Soap Awards here, there’s so many of us,’ laughed Jacqueline.</p>

      <p>Myles and Jacqueline explained that they used rock, paper, and scissors to decide the result.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile back in main camp, Roman Kemp had received a letter containing an announcement.</p>
      <p>He read: ‘Earlier Jacqueline chose Myles to join her in today’s Trial, the Snake Hotel where they won six stars. They were then told they must join the outlaws in the jail house.</p>
      <p>‘However they were given the opportunity of whether to feed the main camp or take the food with them.</p>
      <p>‘Jacqueline and Myles decided to take the food with them to the Jungle jailhouse. As a result you have just got rice and beans tonight.’</p>

      <p>The camp sat in absolute silence, stunned at the news. Adele Roberts then asked Roman if he was telling the truth and he replied that he didn’t blame them as they had won the food.</p>
      <p>But not all of the campmates were so understanding as Ian Wright raged: ‘And how that’s just going to put me in the wrong vibe all day now.’</p>
      <p>Later Ian added: ‘I am gutted. Of course I am. And I’m not going to be any different than that because I’m actually pleased I’m not in a situation where I’d have to make that choice. It would have actually made me feel terrible.’</p>

      <p>Caitlyn Jenner also showed her sympathy towards Ian as she said: ‘I worry about Ian. He can get down and that makes the whole journey even more difficult.</p>
      <p>‘They won six stars so they wanted to take it to the camp that they’re going to. I totally understand that. I saw Ian’s reaction and honesty I kind of feel sorry for him. Sometimes you’re on the winning side, sometimes you’re on the losing side. You just have to learn how to deal with it.’</p>
