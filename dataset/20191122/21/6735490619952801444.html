      <p>The home Iggy Azalea and Playboi Carti are renting Atlanta was broken into with a huge amount of jewelry stolen.</p>
      <p>Local affiliate <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/-350-000-worth-of-jewelry-stolen-from-iggy-azalea-boyfriend-s-buckhead-home/1011550773">WSB-2</a> reported that on Nov. 14 the home located on Howell Mill Road was burglarized with a $57K Audemars Piguet watch, a $35K diamond ring, and a $39K Cuban link chain all stolen from the living room.</p>

      <p>Sources tell <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/22/iggy-azalea-playboi-carti-home-burglarized-jewelry-missing-stolen-thief-atlanta/"><i>TMZ</i> </a>that custom rings, chains, bracelets, pendants, watches, earrings and even a diamond engagement ring are missing. Which would beg the question, are the two engaged? But perhaps a story for another day.</p>
      <p>Azalea told police that she had left the back door unlocked for Carti which she believes the burglar used. She also told them she was in the basement when she “heard footsteps” which she believed to be of her boyfriend.</p>
