      <p>Let us go then, you and me,/when the night’s spread out/like a Bally slot machine,/let us stroll, or take a bus,/and eat oysters with the walrus,/oysters with hot sauce, and a twist of lemon./O, do not ask, “What time is it?”/It’s about a quarter to eleven.</p>

      <p>In the room the women snort and sneeze</p>
      <p>talking of Tom Brady’s knees.</p>
      <p>The yellow fog that fills our brains,</p>
      <p>as we search for leaks under our kitchen drains;</p>
      <p>the yellow smoke consuming evidence</p>
      <p>of what we said, or meant,</p>
      <p>licked its tongue into the halls of Congress,</p>
      <p>who, all undressed,</p>
      <p>lingered in their pestilential pools,</p>
      <p>let fall their legal bribes into their pockets,</p>
      <p>paid off their fools,</p>
      <p>made their daily mental leaps,</p>
      <p>and, seeing that it was a soft October night,</p>
      <p>all 535 bundled together</p>
      <p>like copulating venomous snakes,</p>
      <p>fell asleep.</p>
      <p>And indeed there will be time</p>
      <p>before the next November; there will be time</p>
      <p>to blow more smoke into the streets,</p>
      <p>to smear more lies upon the window panes.</p>
      <p>There will be time, there will be time</p>
      <p>to prepare a face to meet the faces that we smear;</p>
      <p>time to murder and destroy, promote more fear,</p>
      <p>and time for all the works and days of hands</p>
      <p>that lift and drop a question on your plate:</p>
      <p>How much money you got, motherfucker?</p>
      <p>How much you gonna give me?</p>
      <p>O, really, that’s your bank account, sucker?</p>
      <p>Come back after you give me half,</p>
      <p>and maybe I’ll invite you to my campaign tea.</p>
      <p>But that’ll cost you another fifteen large.</p>
      <p>In the room the women comes and goes</p>
      <p>talking of Tom Brady’s nose.</p>
      <p>Yes, indeed, there will be time</p>
      <p>to wonder “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?”</p>
      <p>But fuck it, I’ll do it.</p>
      <p>A few hundred large in my pocket</p>
      <p>will not disturb the universe,</p>
      <p>and if it does,</p>
      <p>the Supreme Court will reverse it.</p>
      <p>So fuck it.</p>
      <p>For I know them all already, know them all:</p>
      <p>their eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase</p>
      <p>about formaldehyde leaking from Chinese plywood</p>
      <p>cut from Indonesian rain forests, that may — or</p>
      <p>may not — have given cancer to poor people in Louisiana</p>
      <p>after Hurricane Katrina</p>
      <p>thanks to the Federal Emergency Management Administration.</p>
      <p>So how should I begin?</p>
      <p>To get a class-action lawyer would cost me $2 million</p>
      <p>just to kick it off,</p>
      <p>and the case will drag on for 30 years,</p>
      <p>by which time I’ll be dead:</p>
      <p>So how should I presume?</p>
      <p>Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets</p>
      <p>and watched the smoke that rises from the pipes</p>
      <p>of lonely men in shirtsleeves, leaning out of windows?</p>
      <p>And even if I did, which I have, who cares?</p>
      <p>I could have been a pair of ragged claws</p>
      <p>scuttling across the floors of silent seas,</p>
      <p>but I couldn’t hold my breath that long:</p>
      <p>not long enough to scuttle, for damn sure,</p>
      <p>way down there where cellphone reception sucks.</p>
      <p>Should I, before the tea and cakes and ices,</p>
      <p>have had the strength to forgo the psychedelics?</p>
      <p>Looking back on it now, it might have saved me,</p>
      <p>and saved whoever those other people were,</p>
      <p>from seeing me weep and pray,</p>
      <p>as I saw my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter.</p>
      <p>It scared the shit out of me, I can tell you that,</p>
      <p>without fear of contradiction.</p>
      <p>And would it have been worth it, after all,</p>
      <p>after the Chicago Cubs blew it again —</p>
      <p>not to mention the Bears —</p>
      <p>would it have been worthwhile</p>
      <p>to bring this up as if it were some overwhelming question,</p>
      <p>if one, settling a pillow by her head</p>
      <p>should say: “Will you shut up</p>
      <p>about your Chicago sports teams?”</p>
      <p>But that was not what I meant;</p>
      <p>That was not it, at all.</p>
      <p>And would it have been worth it, after all,</p>
      <p>would it have been worthwhile,</p>
      <p>after the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,</p>
      <p>after the novels and the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor —</p>
      <p>and after this parody of T.S. Eliot, who wrote:</p>
      <p>
        <i>It is impossible to say just what I mean!</i>
      </p>
      <p>Well, for Pete’s sake, Tom, if you don’t know how to say it,</p>
      <p>why don’t you shut up</p>
      <p>until you figure out how to say it?</p>
      <p>You grew old … you grew grow old …</p>
      <p>You tied your pants in front.</p>
      <p>Did you part your hair behind?</p>
      <p>Did you dare to eat a … fig, Newton?</p>
      <p>If you really wore white flannel trousers</p>
      <p>as you walked upon the beach,</p>
      <p>I hope you didn’t wear big black heavy shoes with shoelaces</p>
      <p>like Richard Nixon did, when he walked upon a beach</p>
      <p>trying to show that he was just a guy like us.</p>
      <p>Which he was.</p>
      <p>And by the way, Tom,</p>
      <p>I don’t believe you ever heard a mermaid singing.</p>
      <p>And if you did, what was she singing?</p>
      <p>Could you sing it back to us?</p>
      <p>I’d like to hear the tune.</p>
      <p>
