      <h2>The Magpies kicked off their Premier League International Cup group games at Whitley Park against Euro giants Benfica</h2>

      <p>Newcastle United boss Steve Bruce and newly appointed first team coach Steve Harper watched on as the club's youngsters put up a battling display against Benfica's B team.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">The young Magpies</a> had their chances to win it but were left hanging in the closing stages as the Portuguese giants piled on the pressure.</p>
      <p>United created an early opportunity when Rosaire Longelo clipped the ball in from the left, but Thomas Allan failed to control in the box and the ball was gathered by Fabio Duarte.</p>
      <p>The home side tried to upset the rhythm of Benfica with a host of early long balls into the box.</p>
      <p>And as Benfica scrambled the ball clear from a right-wing attack on 13 minutes for a corner, the Magpies snatched the lead.</p>
      <p>Longelo's right-wing ball into the danger area and 6ft 4in Frenchman Ludwig Francillette rose highest to power home a header.</p>

      <p>On 27 minutes, United were handed a let-off after a ball was floated in from the left but Kevin Csoboth could only smash his effort up high over the top.</p>
      <p>Benfica won a penalty on 34 minutes after a foul with Daniel Dos Anjos stepping up confidently to roll the ball past Jake Turner.</p>
      <p>Turner guessed the right way but couldn't keep out the youngster from Brazil.</p>
      <p>The Magpies could have regained the lead before half-time when Elliot Anderson broke into the box but Fabio Duarte kept the ball out with crucial block.</p>
      <p>Benfica earned a dangerous free-kick at the start of the second half but Dos Anjos curled the ball inches wide from 25-yards.</p>
      <p>On 62 minutes, Allan's cross picked out Jack Young in the penalty area but he headed straight at Duarte.</p>
      <p>Moments later, Newcastle second string chief Dawson introduced Adam Wilson with the speedy winger replacing Longelo before a second change on 72 minutes resulted in Victor Fernandez coming on for Anderson.</p>

      <p>The game started to become scrappy as it reached the closing stages with England youth international Joe White thrown on to liven things up in midfield in place of Allan with 10 minutes to go.</p>
      <p>In stoppage time Newcastle were grateful to Turner after he palmed away Nuno Santos' free-kick before Benfica followed up seconds later with David Zec's header.</p>
      <p>United survived that spell of late pressure to take a point in their opening group game of the International Cup with games against Hertha Berlin then Blackburn to come.</p>
