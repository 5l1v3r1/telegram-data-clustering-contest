      <p>The second annual Christmas Lights Tour for Charity is returning to Kelowna in December to provide support to Mamas for Mamas.</p>

      <p>"Mamas for Mamas covers all things needed for both moms, dads, children or single parent families in Kelowna," said Lou Burke with Cheers Okanagan Tours.</p>
      <p>"We just like to make sure that they have enough resources to be able to serve their clients for Christmas."</p>
      <p>A list of preferred donations from the Mamas wish-list include spring clothing, rubber boots, infant cutlery, sippy cups and underwear - the full list is available <a href="https://www.mamasformamas.ca/mamas-wish-list/">here</a> and cash donations in a sealed envelope are also accepted.</p>
