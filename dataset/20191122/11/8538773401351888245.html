      <h1>UFC confirms return to London in March 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:11:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:11</time> by <a rel="author">ESPN</a></address>
      <p>UFC will return to London on March 21, 2020 at the O2 Arena, the organisation has announced.</p>
      <p>Jorge Masvidal landed a stunning second round knockout on Darren Till in the headline bout when the event last came to London in UFC Fight Night 147 in March this year, kick-starting a rapid rise in the American's mixed martial arts career.</p>
      <p>Masvidal later <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/video/clip/_/id/26283777">walked away from a post-fight interview to confront Leon Edwards</a> before throwing punches that caused a cut to Edwards' face.</p>
      <p>British fighters Molly McCann and Nathaniel Wood also appeared in UFC Fight Night 147.</p>
      <p>The fighters set to appear in March are yet to be announced.</p>
      <p>Liverpool-born Till has pushed for opponents to fight him in the 2020 London event, notably Australia's Robert Whittaker, who lost the middleweight title to New Zealand's Israel Adesanaya last month. The pair informally agreed to fight in London <a href="https://twitter.com/robwhittakermma/status/1195145936009408512?s=20">via Twitter</a> last week, with the fight yet to be ratified by event organisers.</p>
      <p>UFC first came to London in 2002, with this year's visit marking the 12th time that England's capital has hosted the event.</p>
      <p>Tickets go on general sale on Jan. 31.</p>
