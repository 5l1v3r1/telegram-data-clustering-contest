      <p>The impending ban, which <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3844851&amp;GUID=197102F3-0749-4E4D-A34F-469C8F5DE84C&amp;Options=ID%7CText%7C&amp;Search=1362">30 of the council's 51 members</a> have signed onto as co-sponsors, would prohibit sales of flavored e-cigarettes, including mint and menthol.</p>

      <p>It's the latest move in a series of steps that cities and states have taken to crack down on flavored vaping products. San Francisco voters passed a referendum last year to ban flavored products, and on Wednesday, <a href="https://apnews.com/3bde9035af4044d082859ab587cfba0b">Massachusetts legislatures voted</a> to ban flavors in the state. If that bill is signed into law, Massachusetts will become the first state to prohibit all flavored e-cigarette products.</p>
      <p>State attorney generals have also taken aim at the e-cigarette company <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/york-attorney-general-letitia-james-annouces-lawsuit-juul/story?id=67130834">Juul</a>, which dominates the e-cigarette market, controlling nearly three-quarters of market sales.</p>

      <p>On Tuesday, New York Attorney General Letitia James <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/york-attorney-general-letitia-james-annouces-lawsuit-juul/story?id=67130834">announced a lawsuit</a> against Juul on the grounds that the company's marketing practices were deceptive and geared toward youth.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit comes on the heels of similar suits filed against Juul in North Carolina and California.</p>
      <p>"Juul basically took a page from Big Tobacco's playbook," James said during a Tuesday news briefing in New York. "As a result of all of their advertising, a significant number of young people thought that e-cigarettes were safe."</p>
      <p>Austin Finan, a spokesperson for Juul, said that while the company had not yet reviewed the complaint, it had stopped accepting orders for mint-flavored products, and were committed to developing technology to reduce youth use.</p>
      <p>"We do not intend to attract underage users," he said in a statement to ABC News.</p>
      <p>In New York, two people have died of vaping-related lung disease, including a 17-year-old in the Bronx. At last count, there have been 2,290 cases of lung injuries and 47 deaths linked to vaping, according to the latest numbers from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>
      <p>While THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, has been identified in more than 80% of the laboratory tests CDC has conducted, the agency has not ruled out nicotine, or any other substances, from its investigation.</p>
