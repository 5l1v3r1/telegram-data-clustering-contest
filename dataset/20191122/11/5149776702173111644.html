      <h1>Nottingham Forest transfer supremo lifts the lid on City Ground strategy</h1>
      <h2>The Reds are gearing up for a busy January as they look to bolster their bid to return to the Premier League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:10:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:10</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Jose Anigo is still coming to terms with life in English football, after being appointed as <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>’s new head of international recruitment.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/jose-anigo">Anigo</a>, a former manager at French giants Marseille, admits the job is very different this side of the Channel.</p>
      <p>The main difference being, he says, is that you’re responsible for doing the job you’re paid to do which isn't always the case abroad, although that does carry a greater risk of losing it, if things go wrong.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-transfer-news-rahou-3499001">The 58-year-old Frenchman</a> was appointed by Evangelos Marinakis earlier this season having been tasked with scouring the continent for talent, and he says the system at the City Ground is organised, if not busy.</p>

      <p>“The work is completely different in England compared to in France. There are a lot of analysts, people who work hard, who gather information,” he told RMC.</p>
      <p>“I have been discovering this system for one and a half months, things are organised.”</p>
      <p>Anigo revealed that Forest are <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/sabri-lamouchi-reveals-new-duo-3444044">keen to back his judgement</a> when it comes to him recommending a player with a willingness to get the deal over the line as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>“There is no time to lay back. When you are after a good player, you say to them ‘you must get him,’ they get him,” he said.</p>

      <p>“In France, when I was at Marseille, people would say: ‘Marseille doesn’t recruit, Marseille never saw that guy coming’."</p>
      <p>While owners Evangelos Marinakis and Sokratis Kominakis, chief executive Ioannis Vrentzos, director of football Kyriakos Dourekas and technical director Francois Modesto may all play their role in a deal, Anigo explains that the ultimate responsibility lies with him when it comes to player recommendation, and although there are benefits, there’s also a heavy price to pay if things go wrong.</p>
      <p>“Each person has their job, nobody interferes in the work of someone else, so on that point, when you say to the president, or the director general, or the sporting director, they do not ask how or why,” he said.</p>
      <p>“You assume your responsibilities.</p>
      <p>“The flip side, is that if you are wrong, you will be fired.”</p>
