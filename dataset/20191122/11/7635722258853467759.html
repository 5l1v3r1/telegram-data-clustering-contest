        <b>A Chinese pharmaceutical company is due to build a new vaccine production facility in Dundalk, creating 200 new jobs over the next five years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It will be built on WuXi Biologics’ campus in the Co Louth town, with the firm and its vaccine subsidiary hoping to employ a total of 600 people by 2024.</p>
      <p>The new facility - which will primarily focus on human vaccine, including for cancer - is expected to cost around €217 million.</p>
      <p>Business Minister Heather Humphreys welcomed the news.</p>
      <p>She said: "I am delighted to announce 200 highly-skilled jobs in WuXi Vaccines, which is in addition to the 400 roles announced last year by WuXi Biologics for Dundalk.</p>
      <blockquote>"Without a doubt, this is a great win for the North-East and a huge vote of confidence in the local workforce."</blockquote>
      <p>Dr Chris Chen, chairman of WuXi Vaccines, added: "Due to process complexity, extensive analytic testing and rigorous regulatory standards, vaccines are difficult to manufacture, and process and quality control are extremely critical for the quality of the product.</p>
      <p>"This new project to exclusively manufacture a vaccine for the global market is among the first of its kind in the industry and is a further testimony to the technical strengths and premier quality which WuXi Biologics will bring to Dundalk."</p>
      <p>The €325 million WuXi campus in Dundalk was first announced in April 2018, with the company saying construction of this facility is "now well underway".</p>
