      <h1>Kvadrat launches roller blind that can reduce a building's energy consumption</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:43:14+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/amy-frearson/" target="_blank">Amy Frearson</a></address>
      <p>Danish textile brand <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/kvadrat/">Kvadrat</a> has worked with designers <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/ronan-erwan-bouroullec/">Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec</a> on a roller blind that does more than just screen a window.</p>
      <p><a href="https://kvadratshop.com/en/shade">Kvadrat Shade</a> is a range of window coverings that come in a variety of tones and textures, very much in the spirit of the company's fabrics. But they also offer acoustic benefits and can provide thermal insulation, helping to reduce a building's energy consumption.</p>

      <p>The company has even <a href="https://kvadratshop.com/en/shade/energy-saver">created a calculator</a>, so that customers can find out how much money they can save on their heating bills.</p>
      <p>"We're entering a new industry with the ambition to transform that industry," explained <a href="https://kvadrat.dk/">Kvadrat</a> CEO Anders Byriel at a launch event. "We're coming in with a very deep knowledge about textiles, but we've also got a lot of technology."</p>

      <p>The product was a collaboration with Dutch company <a href="https://coulisse.com/">Coulisse</a>, a specialist in high-performance window-covering solutions, and also draws on the expertise of <a href="https://www.verosol.com/">Verosol</a>, an expert in solar-shading fabrics that is owned by Kvadrat.</p>
      <p>By applying a metallised textile to the underside of the blind, they allow it to function as a thermal insulator. It prevents heat entering in warmer summer months and stops heat escaping in the winter.</p>
      <p>"We actually have a product that offers an alternative to an outside solar-shade product, which moves the options in architecture quite a lot," added Kvadrat Shade managing director Christian Baum Blaakær.</p>

      <p>Paris-based <a href="http://www.bouroullec.com/">Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec</a> had the task of making this high-tech product look as clean and simple as possible. The pair have previously worked with Kvadrat on many projects, including the <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2009/01/16/clouds-by-ronan-and-erwan-bouroullec/">Clouds acoustic screen</a> and the <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2013/01/14/ready-made-curtain-by-ronan-and-erwan-bouroullec-and-kvadrat/">Ready Made Curtain</a>.</p>
      <p>Erwan Bouroullec described the process as "a hell of a job". He explained: "Most of the offers that you see are technically driven; they solve the issue, but they forget the human, they bring no taste."</p>

      <p>"We developed a roller blind concept that has a strong visual identity across every element, and reflects Kvadrat's expertise in colours, materials and technical performance," Bouroullec added.</p>
      <p>"Unlike typical alternatives, the Kvadrat Shade solutions opens intriguing possibilities to elevate interiors by playing with tones, transparencies and textures. You can combine anything and get a great result."</p>

      <p>The designs are produced from polyester, without any PVC, to make them more easily recyclable. Customers can choose between a variety of controls – as well as the traditional cord, there is also the option for slender sticks or remote controls.</p>
      <p>Kvadrat believe the product range features a good solution for every type of window and situation. The team said they have already arranged for the product to be installed on several major new buildings.</p>

      <p>Other recent launches from Kvadrat include <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2018/04/04/benjamin-hubert-kvadrat-recycled-textile-milan-design-week/">shelving designed by Layer</a> for the company's recycled textile brand Really and <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/02/16/kvadrat-curtains-margrethe-odgaard-diorama-panorama-suite/">curtains designed by Margrethe Odgaard</a> that took cues from wainscoting.</p>
