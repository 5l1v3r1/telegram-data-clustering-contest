      <h1>Leganés-Barça: Valverde needs to make a decision on his defensive line</h1>
      <h2>Injuries and suspensions have forced Valverde to change his plans for Leganes and later Dortmund</h2>

      <p>Ernesto Valverde must find a solution for Barça's next two matches. They first face Leganes in LaLiga before taking on Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>First choice fullbacks Nelson Semedo and Jordi Alba are out and usual backup on the right, Sergi Roberto, is suspended. Centre back Gerard Pique is available for Leganes but is suspended himself for the Dortmund game.</p>
      <p>Samuel Umtiti still hasn't fully recovered from his knee injury and is a doubt for both matches.</p>
      <p>Everything suggests Moussa Wague will be handed his first start of the season against Leganes. Junior Firpo is expected to continue on the left.</p>
      <p>As Valverde tries to balance his squad for the upcoming matches, he might need to rotate his centre backs. Jean Clair Todibo is the other option but he's rarely featured this season either.</p>

      <h3>PROBLEM WITH THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE</h3>
      <p>The fixture against Dortmund will see Valverde recover Sergi Roberto, who can slot in at right-back, but he'll lose Pique. Umtiti, Lenglet and Junior would most likely make up the rest of the back four.</p>
      <p>Barça struggled in the away fixture when Marc-Andre ter Stegen was the hero that night back in Germany. However, the team has only kept five clean sheets in their 16 matches this season, all away from home (Dortmund, Getafe and Eibar).</p>
      <p>Due to the lack of options in defence Dani Morer, Óscar Mingueza and Sergio Akieme all trained with the first team today.</p>
