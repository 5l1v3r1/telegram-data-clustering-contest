      <h2>Heavy and persistent rain is due to start in south-west England from 12pm on Friday and last until 6pm on Saturday - meaning a deluge for roughly 30 hours</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:43:13+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:43</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>The Met Office has issued four weather warnings across the UK for Saturday, including parts of north-east England where heavy flooding has caused significant disruption in previous weeks.</p>
      <p>Heavy and persistent rain is due to start in south-west England from 12pm on Friday and last until 6pm on Saturday - meaning a deluge for roughly 30 hours.</p>
      <p>About 20-30mm of rain is expected widely in the region, though the up-slopes of Dartmoor in south Devon could see 40-50mm of rain.</p>
      <p>The average rainfall for Devon and Cornwall during November is roughly 135-45mm.</p>
      <p>Yellow warnings have also been issued in north-eastern England and parts of Scotland, which will also be hit with continuing wet <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> throughout Saturday.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> added that areas such as Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire will see persistent rain arriving from the south early on Saturday morning, which will last through most of the day.</p>
      <p>According to the Met Office, rain will be heavy at times, especially on hills where the rainfall could also reach up to 40-50mm.</p>
      <p>The region is still recovering from heavy flooding that caused devastation in many communities in the last two weeks.</p>
      <p>Met Office data up to November 17 shows that Nottinghamshire has seen the most rain of all UK counties compared with the average, having seen 189% of its monthly average already.</p>
      <p>There are currently 45 flood alerts and six flood warnings in place that have been issued by the Environment Agency.</p>
      <p>Four of the flood warnings are in the North East.</p>
      <p>Wet weather is also expected to develop across north-eastern Scotland from Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Met said that general rainfall of 20-40mm was likely through Aberdeenshire, and areas of high ground could reach 60-80 mm in addition to thawing snow.</p>
