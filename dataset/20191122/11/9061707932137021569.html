      <p>A driver had to be rescued by firefighters after an accident saw him trapped in his car in a South Derbyshire country lane.</p>
      <p>The vehicle rolled on the lanes in Drakelow, at the junction of Cadley Lane and Caldwell Road, and ended up trapped between a tree and a telegraph pole.</p>
      <p>A spokesman <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derbyshire-police">for Derbyshire police</a> said they were called at 9.35am today, November 22, by East Midlands Ambulance Service as one man was trapped in the vehicle.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/east-midlands-ambulance-service">East Midlands Ambulance Service </a>said: "We received a call at 9.23am on November 22 to Caldwell Road in Drakelow.</p>

      <p>"We sent a paramedic in a car and a crewed ambulance.‚Äù</p>
      <p>The spokesman said the patient had been taken to <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/health">Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham</a>.</p>
      <p>One motorist, who did not wish to be named but uses that road every day, said: "That bend in the lanes is probably one of the tightest bends around here.</p>
      <p>"And considering it is on a road with a 60mph limit, I think there should be warnings about how tight it is.</p>
      <p>"I think a lot of people could misjudge it if they are new to the area, so there should be signs warning people that it is a tighter bend than they might think.</p>
      <p>"I don't know if that had anything to do with what happened here - I just hope the driver is Okay."</p>
