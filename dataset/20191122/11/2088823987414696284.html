      <h1>Thanks, heartbreak and awe: Readers' memories of the November 2014 storm</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:00:54+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/qina.liu.5, https://www.facebook.com/sara.p.meehan</a></address>
      <p>As reader Chris Christie wrote, "A good <span dir="ltr">snow storm is like a good song. You remember exactly where you were and what you were doing when you think about it. It’s fun to think back." </span></p>
      <p>We remember where we were during <a href="https://buffalonews.com/topic/wall-of-snow/">the November storm of 2014.</a> At this point five years ago, we were in the crux of <a href="https://buffalonews.com/topic/wall-of-snow/">documenting the storm</a> — collecting <a href="https://buffalonews.com/2019/11/13/gallery3325/">photos</a>, <a href="https://buffalonews.com/2014/11/22/more-short-stories-that-came-out-of-snowvember/">stories</a>, snow tallies and <a href="https://buffalonews.com/2014/11/23/gallery3307/">even memes. </a></p>

      <p>Five years later, we're still <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheBuffaloNews/posts/10157861680543151">collecting your stories</a>. Read on for the stories, long and short, that readers sent our way.</p>

      <h3>Barbara Carty</h3>
      <p>
        <i>I heard the news in my office in downtown Tucson. My cell rang and my sister Sue was on the phone.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Mom needs you. Mary is on hospice. Can you get home?"</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Mary, my sister one year older than me, had triple-negative breast cancer for about two years. People always survived breast cancer; what is this hospice thing?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I lived in Tucson for many years, separated from the day-to-day life of my Buffalo family. I got on a plane and was back home within 24 hours. I was with my sister, mom and Mary in her room at Mercy Hospital. The doctors had discharged her to home hospice.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>It seemed as if, magically, a bed, oxygen concentrator, medications and nurses appeared at my mom's house. What appeared to be magic was the work of my brother-in-law, nieces and nephew.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>We all settled in and Sue and Mom kept vigil attending to Mary. As I lay in bed, mom called out to me and said, "Barb, come look at this!" I went and looked out the window at a steady snowfall. It was peaceful, with the ground already covered.</i>

        <i>By morning, the snow had encased Mary, Mom, Sue and I together in our childhood family home. Dad had passed on a couple of decades before, but I swear I always felt his presence in that house.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>We shoveled snow. A lot. We needed to keep the driveway and stairs clear in case of any emergency. This Buffalo girl-turned-desert rat was ill-equipped for the task. My sis Sue took the lead and got it done.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>So, over four days, we laughed a little, we cried in solitude, we ate, we watched the news, and of course I argued with Mare as usual. We all knew it was the last time we would be together, but no one said so. We listened as she coughed, with her lungs compromised.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>We were within 1,600 square feet of each other, uninterrupted and undisturbed. This was not a time of a Hallmark movie, but one so real and raw it be captured in our spirits.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Mary continued to rally. I left my New York family for my Arizona one on the day of the big thaw, my birthday: Nov. 25.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Mary passed away with dignity on Nov. 29. She was so graceful not to leave us on my birthday, Thanksgiving, my nephew's birthday in early December or during the polar vortex storm!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>So, were there acts of heroism here? No ... nothing like that. It was extreme acts of God that brought my family close for one last time.</i>

      <h3>Maureen M. Vogel</h3>
      <p>
        <i>We lived in an apartment complex in Hamburg on Route 20, which was one of the hardest-hit areas. Luckily, we were at home and didn't get stuck elsewhere. Once it started snowing, I watched it snow hard for three straight days. When it finally stopped, we all had to go out and find our cars. They weren't visible at all under huge drifts of snow. All the neighbors pitched in digging each other out.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>A bulldozer removed as much snow as possible. We got our cars back in their spots, only to have it happen all over again for the next two days. We were home bound for an entire week. Thank God, we were at home! </i>
        <i>I was here for '77 and this was, by far, the worst snow we ever had! Eight feet of snow in all — over five days.</i>

      <h3>Marilyn Bradford McCormick</h3>
      <p>
        <i>I cried for the first time in my life during this storm. Even living through the Blizzard of '77 wasn’t as bad. Seven feet of snow was insurmountable even after shoveling every half-hour. Then the cavalry of good Samaritans and neighbors came marching down my street like the parting of the Red Sea, shovels and snowblowers in tow</i>
        <i>.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I’ll never forget that day as long as I live. Thankful for this wonderful community.</i>

      <p>
        <i>This storm broke my heart, and I still struggle with the emotions from the time. My mother's funeral Mass was being held on Saturday. Those relatives from north of Buffalo attended; those from the Southtowns (many of whom had flown in from other locations) were not able to get there. The church was pretty empty. Mother Nature was cruel.</i>

      <p>
        <i>My mom who lived in north Cheektowaga (12 minutes away from us) had a mere dusting of snow. We had 7 feet on our driveway in the south end of town. I showed her pictures of our snowfall; she was amazed.</i>

      <p>
        <i>An inch of snow in Amherst. Hopped on a plane and went to Anaheim. People in California were amazed we made it there. Saw the wall from my office at UB. It was quite amazing. Luckily for me, I was on the side of the wall without snow!</i>

        <i>My mom called from Boston, Mass., asking if I was OK. I told her there was barely a dusting. I lived in Williamsville at the time. Great weather phenomenon to witness, though.</i>

        <i>Awful, waiting to be dug out for four days, hoping the furnace and electric stayed on. I was alone. At 5 feet tall, I had to dig out a little each day. Forget help from the neighbors in this place. West Seneca was not a nice place to be.</i>

        <i>Our lookback at the 2014 storm sparked one reader's memories of Buffalo's other iconic storm: the Blizzard of '77.</i>
      </p>
      <h3>Jan Schilling</h3>
      <p>
        <i>I am certain my letter to you won't be the only one you get referencing the storm of January 1977, which hit downtown and South Buffalo areas and finally amounted to 12 feet of snow. I lived in Depew, and the drive to and from work every day normally took me about 30-40 minutes. On Jan. 27 (I think), I went to work at the Erie County unit of the New York State American Cancer Society, as the director of Professional Education, Service and Rehabilitation, which was housed in the Statler Hotel. I always parked two blocks away, but that morning, with snow due, I decided to pay an outrageous fee to park in a garage behind the hotel.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>That was the day of the New York State Cancer Society's contest for Miss Hope/the Daffodil parade, to be held later. We had multiple entrants coming for interviews and later an award show in the hotel. Around noon, I had come to the first floor from our office on the third floor to check on some arrangements, and saw this mountain of snow on a man walk through the revolving doors — he was covered with about 3 inches thick with heavy snow. He muttered that we were having a lake-effect storm. Boy, was he right! I ran to the desk and asked for a room in the hotel and got the last one. (My husband worked for American Airlines in reservations, and his office was on the 18th floor ... and I knew we were not going home that night.)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The contest went forth and a beautiful young lady was picked Miss Hope. The storm continued to rage outside. No one was going home that night. All of the contestants slept on the floor of the American Cancer Society's third-floor office, and when the hotel food ran out, my boss Jim Menton, director of the Erie County Unit of the American Cancer Society, and my husband went to a local restaurant feet from the hotel and bought sandwiches for them.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>We finally made it home the next day, assisted by my son's use of a CB radio ... and he directed us to the path we needed to drive. Once there, I was there for two weeks, while Buffalo remained closed to business, schools were closed, and traffic was prohibited, to anywhere from anywhere. My husband continued to travel to the city every day, because he worked for American Airlines and transportation had to move. He said the number of cars abandoned on the highways was making clearing them very difficult.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>During this period of time, Jimmy Carter was our president, and he sent his son to Depew to see if Buffalo and surrounding cities were allowed to claim disaster areas. Chip Carter climbed on a snowbank two streets behind us and claimed that we had more snow than Alaska. At that time the mountain of snow he was standing on was over 12 feet high, and it was fresh snow that had fallen.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>We moved to Texas about six months later on a previously known about transfer that American Airlines was putting through for the reservations offices. I would never have moved because of the snow — Buffalo was my home and I still consider it my home even though we have been in Texas 42 years. I am the first one in line at the airport anytime I can have a reason to come back.</i>

        <i>Thanks for giving me an avenue to tell my story.</i>
