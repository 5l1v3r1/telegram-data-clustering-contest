      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/oamc">OAMC</a> has released the Free Solo sneaker in both a low top and high top iteration for <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/fall-winter-2019">Fall/Winter 2019</a>. Designed in Paris and developed in the imprint’s Italian atelier, the sneaker brings design cues inspired by mountaineering and alpine footwear as well as the label’s signature clean aesthetic.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/Luke-Meier">Luke Meier</a>-helmed label introduces the Free Solo as an all-new sneaker following its <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/8/oamc-adidas-collaboration-dev-hynes">recent collaboration</a> with adidas Originals. For its own sneaker, OAMC utilizes premium leather alongside a custom-designed and developed rubber outsole for both its Free Solo offerings.</p>
      <p>It combines exceptional craft with performance and is formal yet tinged with elements from chunky and trail sneaker trends. As a result, its upper is left clean and sports a simple OAMC stamp on the rear-quarter, a set of silver-toned eyelets, and is finished with flat laces that are either in a block color or speckled depending on the colorway. The sole unit is carved and angular in places, with ridges at the top contrasting a smooth bottom section for an added minimalist touch.</p>
      <p>Both the high top and low top are available in “Off White,” “Black” and “Ivy,” and are available in limited quantities from stockists including Dover Street Market, I.T, Antonioli, <a href="https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men/product/oamc/off-white-free-solo-sneakers/4080641">SSENSE</a> and Tomorrowland.</p>
