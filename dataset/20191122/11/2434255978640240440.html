      <h2>“I don’t actually know what it means to be happy”</h2>

      <p>Elaine Crowley has opened up about the realities of living with “chronic” depression in a brave new interview aimed at helping others to cope with mental illness.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/virgin-media">Virgin Media</a> presenter described herself as a “high functioning-coping depressive” because she’s never missed a day of work with her mental illness, but says the effort it takes to do that has “drained every other part of my life hugely and it’s only now I’m realising”.</p>
      <p>“I don’t actually know what it means to be happy,” she said. “That might sound terrible. I have moments of happiness, but my baseline is kind of dysphoria”.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t been the nicest, but I was ill, and I didn’t realise how bad it was and when you’re very, very sick there’s consequences to it and when I was sick, I did push people away and they stayed away”.</p>

      <p>As part of Aware’s new ‘Resilience Series’, Elaine spoke about feeling depressed from as young as eight years old, and recalled struggling to adjust to college life in <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/dublin">Dublin</a> after completing her leaving cert at the age of 16.</p>
      <p>“I suppose it was during college that the clinical diagnosis first would have raised its head”. <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/elaine-crowley">Elaine</a> explained that she was prescribed antidepressants, which she thought would “fix” her,  and “went on with life as best I could”.</p>
      <p>“I thought it was a one-off, I didn’t realise that it would become something so chronic,” she explained. “And I was in denial pretty much about that for the next twenty years”.</p>
      <p>The TV presenter revealed how she struggled to come to terms with her mental illness and didn’t want to be known as “mad” or “bonkers”, but admitted to “feeling like a complete fraud” when talking to people on her chat show about their struggles.</p>

      <p>“I felt like such a fraud because I wasn’t admitting my own problem and then once I did, it was a weight off my shoulders”.</p>
      <p>Now, Elaine says she copes with depression by seeing a psychiatrist, taking medication, eating well and getting enough sleep and exercise.</p>
      <p>“All these things might seem simple to the normal person, but for me it’s essential and sometimes it doesn’t happen”.</p>
      <p>“You can take a Statin if you’ve cholesterol problems. I mean, I just take another form of medication to keep my health in check”.</p>
