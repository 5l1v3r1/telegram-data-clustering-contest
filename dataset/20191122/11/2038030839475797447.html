      <p>Cape Town – French Montana was rushed to hospital on Thursday, reportedly after suffering heart problems.</p>
      <p>The rapper was transported via ambulance to San Fernando Valley hospital after complaining about severe stomach pains, nausea and an elevated heart rate, reports <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1096016/french-montana-rushed-to-hospital-over-cardiac-issues"><b>E! News</b></a>.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/21/french-montana-hospitalized-heart-rate-elevated-stomach-pain/"><b>TMZ</b></a>, authorities said when they arrived at his LA home, he was “acting abnormal and seemed out of it”.</p>
      <p>Sources close to the <i>Writing On The Wall</i> hitmaker think his symptoms may have something to do with his recent travels where he could have eaten contaminated food.  </p>
