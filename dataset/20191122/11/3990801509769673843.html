      <p>Welcome to the latest edition of Pardon The Intrusion, TNW’s <a href="https://thenextweb.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=22ec88eb9b9d8bc3bcf660787&amp;id=37136e54f1&amp;e=0e200ae170">bi-weekly newsletter</a> in which we explore the wild world of security.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thenextweb.com/newsletter/2019/11/08/pardon-the-intrusion-4-smart-malware/">In the last newsletter</a>, we talked about using AI to tackle the problem of malware.</p>
      <p>That got me thinking about how we can come up with efficient machine learning (ML) models to detect malicious content, especially as they’re constantly evolving.</p>
      <p>You know how it goes: cyber baddies find one way to sneak malware onto computers, and security folks build defenses to stop them. The villains then find another way to creep in, a new defense is built.</p>
      <p>Break in, defend, repeat. It goes on and on.</p>
      <p>I asked Adrien Gendre, Chief Solution Architect at predictive email defense firm <a href="https://thenextweb.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=22ec88eb9b9d8bc3bcf660787&amp;id=eb0ca7a35c&amp;e=0e200ae170">Vade Secure</a>, about this. As it turns out, it requires understanding the threats you’re likely to face as a business and model an appropriate solution.</p>
      <p>“When malware signatures change frequently, the machine learning models built to detect them lose their predictive capabilities,” Gendre says. “It’s essential that we define the malicious behaviors so that ML models are efficient.”</p>
      <p>But this also means the models are trained not just on proper data sets, but also on adversarial inputs, he warns.</p>
      <p>Here’s the catch: having huge amounts of training data alone doesn’t mean anything. There needs to be proper data quality checks in place too.</p>
      <p>“What we need is a sound supervised ML model that’s built on quality data,” Gendre says.</p>
      <p>So what does all this translate to? Before embracing AI for cybersecurity, businesses need to understand how they’re used, if they’re efficient, and if they have been done the right way.</p>

        <li>A new parody website generates random excuses to explain why companies got hacked and apologize to their users. [<a href="https://thenextweb.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=22ec88eb9b9d8bc3bcf660787&amp;id=b5c72bce3e&amp;e=0e200ae170">Why the fuck was I breached?</a>]</li>

        <li>Throwback to a 2015 story about a hacker and modern-day Robin Hood: Hamza Bendelladj was sentenced in the US for using a computer virus to steal money from more than 200 American banks and financial institutions to give millions of dollars to Palestinian charities. [<a href="https://thenextweb.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=22ec88eb9b9d8bc3bcf660787&amp;id=17e79fc915&amp;e=0e200ae170">Al Jazeera</a>]</li>

        <li>Talk about going rogue. An employee of cybersecurity firm TrendMicro sold data belonging to 68,000 customers — less than 1% of the company’s 12 million customer base — to tech support scammers.

        <li>Amazon patched a flaw in Ring doorbells that exposed the passwords for the Wi-Fi networks to which they were connected to in cleartext, allowing nearby hackers to intercept the Wi-Fi password and gain access to the network to launch larger attacks or conduct surveillance.

        <li>IT provider InfoTrax Systems detected a security breach only after one of its servers maxed out its storage capacity — the result of the hacker creating a data archive file that had grown so large that a hard drive ran out of space.

      <h3>Data Point</h3>
      <p>New statistics <a href="https://thenextweb.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=22ec88eb9b9d8bc3bcf660787&amp;id=4f5fe99df5&amp;e=0e200ae170">published by APWG</a> have revealed that phishing attacks are at the highest level in 3 years. The total number of phishing sites detected in July through September 2019 was 266,387. This was up 46% from the 182,465 seen in the second quarter of 2019, and almost double the 138,328 seen in Q4 2018.</p>

      <p><i><b>Takeaway:</b></i> It’s no surprise that <a href="https://thenextweb.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=22ec88eb9b9d8bc3bcf660787&amp;id=6b3c486910&amp;e=0e200ae170">attackers are constantly looking for new ways</a> to trick users into giving out personal information. Part of the reason <a href="https://thenextweb.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=22ec88eb9b9d8bc3bcf660787&amp;id=5078c383ba&amp;e=0e200ae170">phishing attacks continue to be successful</a> is because there’s always going to be someone who will click a shady link. What’s needed is an urgent awareness about phishing campaigns that target them and help the public understand why they are at risk.</p>
