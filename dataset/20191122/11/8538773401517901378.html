      <h3>Which nations will take part in the Euro 2020 playoffs?</h3>
      <p>The playoffs were formed using UEFA Nations League performance, taking the best-performing nations who did not qualify automatically.</p>
      <p>A draw was needed to decide which of Bulgaria, Israel, Romania, Hungary remained in League C to play Scotland, and which three moved up to join Iceland in League A, as eight League C nations qualified for a playoff.</p>
      <p>
        <anchor name="format"/>
      </p>
      <p><b>League A:</b> Iceland, <i>Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary</i></p>
      <p><b>League B:</b> Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovakia, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland</p>
      <p><b>League C:</b> Scotland, Norway, Serbia, Israel,</p>
      <p><b>League D:</b> Georgia, Macedonia, Kosovo, Belarus</p>
      <h3>What is the format and when will games be played?</h3>
      <p>Each of the four League paths will contain four teams. Each path will have two semifinals and a final. The winners of each of the four League finals will qualify for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>
        <anchor name="fixtures"/>
      </p>
      <p>The semifinals will be played on Thursday, March 26, 2020.</p>
      <p>The finals will take place on Tuesday, March 31, 2020.</p>
      <p>The standard kickoff time, as with the group stage, is 7.45 p.m. CET</p>
      <h3>What are the playoff fixtures?</h3>
      <p><b><u>League A</u></b><br/>Iceland vs. Romania<br/>Bulgaria vs. Hungary<br/><b>HOME TEAM IN FINAL: </b>Bulgaria or Hungary</p>
      <p><b><u>League B</u></b><br/>Bosnia and Herzegovina vs. Northern Ireland<br/>Slovakia vs. Republic of Ireland<br/><b>HOME TEAM IN FINAL: </b>Bosnia and Herzegovina or Northern Ireland</p>
      <p><b><u>League C</u></b><br/>Scotland vs. Israel<br/>Norway vs. Serbia<br/><b>HOME TEAM IN FINAL: </b>Norway or Serbia</p>
      <p><b><u>League D</u></b><br/>Georgia vs. Belarus<br/>North Macedonia vs. Kosovo<br/><b>HOME TEAM IN FINAL: </b>Georgia or Belarus</p>
      <p>
        <anchor name="playofff"/>
      </p>
      <h3>When will the venues be known?</h3>
      <p>Nations have until Dec. 20 to announce their chosen stadia for the semifinals and final.</p>
      <h3>How will the playoffs affect the finals draw?</h3>
      <p>Hosts Romania (Group C) and Hungary (Group F) were both drawn into Path A. This path must be paired with Path D, which has no host, so either Romania or Hungary can play in their host city, should they win the Path A playoff.</p>
      <p>
        <anchor name="finalsd"/>
      </p>
      <p>This is how it works:<br/>- Group F (Hungary) has been drawn as the "priority group." This is effectively the same as the path winners being drawn into the group unless the other paired host qualifies<br/>- It means the Path A winners go into Group F, and Path D winners into Group C<br/>- If Hungary win the playoff, the draw is unaltered as they are already drawn into the Budapest group<br/>- If Romania win the playoff, they will swap places with the League D playoff winners in Group C to be in their Bucharest host group<br/>- If a team other other than Hungary or Romania wins the playoff, the draw is unaltered</p>
      <h3>When is the finals draw?</h3>
      <p>The draw will be held on Saturday, Nov. 30 in Bucharest, Romania. The draw ceremony will begin at midday ET (6 p.m. CET) and is expected to last 50 minutes in total (with 20 minutes for the draw itself).</p>
