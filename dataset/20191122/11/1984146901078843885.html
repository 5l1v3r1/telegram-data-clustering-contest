      <h1>Newcastle injuries and suspensions: Matt Ritchie concern but key man is back for Villa</h1>
      <h2>Here is the latest injury news as Steve Bruce assesses his squad over the final international break of 2019</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:52:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:52</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Douglas</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle United finally return to action on Monday as they take on Aston Villa at Villa Park.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a> has yet to be able to pick from a full-strength squad since he arrived on Tyneside last summer, but he has several long-term absentees close to a return.</p>
      <p>He heads to the West Midlands with injury concerns in defence, though. Here is the latest injury and suspension situation at Newcastle United.</p>
      <h3>Jamaal Lascelles</h3>
      <p>The Magpies skipper is out for another four to six weeks after fracturing his tibia when he collided with Martin Dubravka in the Bournemouth game.</p>
      <p>Although that is a sizeable blow for the centre-back, Steve Bruce has admitted he feared it was a cruciate ligament injury when he first came off the field.</p>
      <p>Lascelles could return in January.</p>

      <h3>Ciaran Clark</h3>
      <p>The goalscoring hero of Newcastle's last two games is a major concern for a potential return to his former club. Bruce rates his chances no better than 50/50.</p>
      <p>"He's got a knock. We ll see how he is," Bruce said at Thursday's press conference.</p>
      <h3>Fabian Schar</h3>
      <p>The Swiss defender is back in contention for Newcastle, having trained for the past two weeks. Schar missed his nation's crucial Euro 2020 qualifiers last week but is fit again and could play at Villa after being absent since mid-October.</p>
      <p>"Lejeune and Fab Schar have trained all the past two weeks so they come into the reckoning," Bruce said.</p>

      <h3>Florian Lejeune</h3>
      <p>The Frenchman is in contention for a place in the Magpies squad for the trip to Villa Park on November 25.</p>
      <p>After two appearances for the Under-23s following his rehabilitation from a long-term knee injury, Lejeune has enough football in his legs to be considered for the game in the West Midlands.</p>
      <p>"The big one is Flo because he's been out for so long. He's done everything - played in games, got minutes under his belt on the training ground. Now he's ready to go," he said.</p>

      <h3>Matt Ritchie</h3>
      <p>Ritchie will not be fit for the Villa Park clash and Steve Bruce <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-team-news-aston-villa-17291306">is continuing not to put a timescale on his return</a> .</p>
      <p>The midfielder had another setback after appearing to be "close" to a return.</p>
      <p>"It's still ongoing. He went to see his specialist again yesterday. It's a difficult one because he was so close a couple weeks ago but unfortunately had a setback," Bruce said.</p>
      <p>"He had to seek a second opinion. It's difficult and frustrating for him. An awful one where he was very close. He joined in training and unfortunately had a reaction to whatever has gone on so it's very disappointing.</p>

      <h3>Suspended</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Sean Longstaff</b>
      </p>
      <p>Longstaff has now served two games of a three-match suspension after he received a straight red card against Wolves, and will complete his ban against Aston Villa.</p>
