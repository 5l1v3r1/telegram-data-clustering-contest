      <p>More stylish and luxurious GLS gets lots of upgrades inside and out; is powered by a single mild-hybrid 4.0-litre V8 engine.</p>
      <p>Mercedes-Benz has added another model to its Maybach line-up, with the unveiling of the plush new Maybach GLS at the 2019 Guangzhou motor show, in China.</p>
      <p>Positioned alongside the S-class-based Maybach sedan – the top-flight SUV is poised as a rival to the likes of the Bentley Bentayga and Range Rover – it features a series of unique styling cues, a mild-hybrid drivetrain and an upgraded interior.</p>
      <p>The new model invokes many of the styling elements seen on the Maybach-badged S-class to help distinguish it from the standard third-generation GLS. Included is a distinctive chrome grille featuring vertical louvres, chrome highlights within the side window surrounds and along the sills, standard 22-inch (and optional 23-inch) wheels, an optional two-tone exterior paint scheme in eight different colour combinations, electrically extending running boards and chromed tail-pipes, with a signature cross-rib.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the new model, Mercedes-Benz’s head of product management, Martin Hülder, said: “SUV vehicles have a major advantage for the luxury segment: the high seating position. In combination with the running boards, this makes access and egress easy and convenient."</p>
      <p>Inside, the 5,202mm-long Mercedes-Maybach GLS sports an upgraded interior with nappa leather upholstery and unique trim elements. Among the long list of options for customers are reclining rear seats with a massage function, a fixed centre console with folding tables and a refrigerator in a four-seat layout that can be further enhanced with a panoramic sunroof. Boot capacity below the cargo blind at the rear is 520 litres. Reflecting its upper luxury positioning, the latest Maybach model also receives a long list of standard driving aids.</p>
      <p>Mercedes-Benz’s most luxurious SUV will be offered from the outset of sales with just one drivetrain in the GLS 600 4Matic. The mild-hybrid unit combines a turbocharged 4.0-litre V8 petrol engine with a 48V integrated starter motor to provide an overall output of 558hp at 6,000rpm and 730Nm of torque from 2,500-5,000rpm. The electrically boosted reserves are channelled through a 9-speed torque converter automatic gearbox and 4Matic all-wheel drive. Mercedes-Benz claims a 0-100kph time for the 2,710kg Maybach GLS 600 4Matic of 4.9sec. Top speed is limited to 250kph.</p>
      <p>Underpinning the new top-of-the-line GLS model is a specially tuned version of Mercedes-Benz’s E-Active Body control suspension. Also included is a curve inclination function that allows the big new SUV to lean into corners to reduce the lateral forces acting on the occupants.</p>
      <p>While the Maybach GLS will, at first, be introduced in markets like China, North America and Europe, we expect the ultra luxurious SUV to make it to India as well. </p>
