      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Nithyananda is suspected to have fled to Ecuador, his passport had expired</li>
        <li>Nithyananda is an accused in a case of kidnapping and torture of children in Gujarat</li>
        <li>Nithyananda is also an accused in a case of rape registered in Karnataka</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Self-styled godman Nithyananda is suspected to have fled the country dodging the security agencies of the country. He is being probed in criminal cases involving a rape case in Karnataka, and kidnapping and torture case in Gujarat.</p>
      <p>According to sources in the know of related developments, Nithyananda has not appeared in the court in more than 40 hearings of the cases against him. The sources have told India Today that Nithyananda has escaped to Ecuador via Nepal.</p>
      <p>However, the puzzling link in this escape saga is that his passport had expired in September 2018. It has not been renewed. This was confirmed by a former Ramanagara (Karnataka) superintendent of police to India Today TV.</p>
      <p>He said, "When cases are pending, normally we do not recommend renewal of passports. I checked and confirmed that we rejected renewal of his passoport when I was the Ramanagara SP." India Today has accessed Nithyananda's passport. It expired on September 30 2018.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Ahmedabad (Rural) Superintendent of Police RV Asari said Nithyananda fled the country after a rape case was registered against him in Karnataka, and it will be a waste of time searching for him in Gujarat. Asari said if required, the Gujarat police will seek his custody through proper channel.</p>
      <p>This matter came to light after Gujarat police arrested three persons including the principal of the Delhi Public School in Ahmedabad in the past few days. Nithyananda was booked in a criminal case related to his ashram in Ahmedabad.</p>
      <p>The Gujarat police are working to gather concrete evidence against him after taking two of his disciples in remand. An FIR was registered on Wednesday against the controversial godman on the charges of kidnapping and wrongful confinement of children to make them collect donations from followers to run his ashram in Ahmedabad, Yogini Sarvagyapeetham.</p>
      <p>Two sadhvis (his disciples) -- Pranpriya and Priyatatva - of his ashram arrested on Tuesday on kidnapping, illegal confinement and assault, among other charges, were sent to five days police remand by a Gujarat court on Wednesday evening.</p>
      <p>The two sadhvis were arrested after two children aged 9 to 10 years enrolled at the ashram told the police they were tortured, made to work and kept in illegal confinement at a flat in the city for over ten days. Similar allegations were made by two other children rescued from the ashram on the basis of a complaint filed by their parents, the police said.</p>
