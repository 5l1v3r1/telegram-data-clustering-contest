      <p>2Face described the Nigerian system as a joke and  added that the country has been hijacked by criminals.</p>
      <p>2Face however stated that he is hopeful the new generation of young men and women will steer the affairs of the country in the near future.</p>
      <p>He tweeted “Naija system is a total joke. Criminals have hijacked naija. Men and women that have dedicated their time 2 make sure that naija will carry last.. No shame. No dignity. No honor. I pray the young men that have entered the system will do their best to influence positive change”.</p>
