      <h1>St. Vincent – “Smoking Section (Jlin Remix)”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:52:01+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:52</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Breihan</a></address>
      <p>St. Vincent released her album <i><a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1966019/premature-evaluation-st-vincent-masseduction/franchises/premature-evaluation/">MASSEDUCTION</a></i> two years ago, and she followed it up last year with <i><a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2018526/stream-st-vincent-masseduction-rework-masseducation/music/album-stream/">MassEducation</a></i>, a stripped-down reimagining of the same LP. Next month, we’ll get <i>another</i> version of <i>MASSEDUCTION</i> with the release of <i>Nina Kraviz Presents MASSEDUCTION Rewired</i>.</p>
      <p>Nina Kravitz, the adventurous Russian dance producer, curated the remixes for the new collection, and she did some herself, too; we’ve already posted <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2061156/st-vincent-announces-masseduction-remix-album-shares-nina-kraviz-new-york-reworking/music/">her reworking</a> of “New York.” There are some other fascinating contributors, too, like Laurel Halo and Pearson Sound. And today, we get to hear what happens when Jlin gets her hands on a St. Vincent song.</p>
      <p>Jlin, the avant-garde footwork traveller, has remixed St. Vincent’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6kIN1P2CU8">Smoking Section</a>” and turned it into something unrecognizable, cutting it up into shards and then scattering those shards everywhere. In Jlin’s hands, Annie Clark’s voice becomes a sort of hiccuping ghost, fighting for space with off-kilter drums and blooms of bass. The song’s piano comes through relatively unexploded, though. Listen to the Jlin remix below.</p>
