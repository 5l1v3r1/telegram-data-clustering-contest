      <p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has said that former Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino will be highly sought after among Europe's biggest clubs.</p>
      <p>The Argentine, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/tottenham-hotspur/story/3993891/pochettino-sacked-by-tottenham-mourinho-lined-up-to-step-in-sources">sacked by Tottenham on Tuesday</a>, will be in-demand following his success in North London, according to Klopp, who said that he was surprised by the dismissal.</p>
      <p>"My first Premier League game was against him so we have a history," Klopp said. "Any job that is available he will be in contention.</p>
      <p>"Five months ago I played him in Champions League final, now he is on holiday. He did brilliant job at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>"Everything will be fine for him, but it was a big one, when I first heard I couldn't believe it."</p>
      <p>Pochettino was <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/tottenham-hotspur/story/3994171/jose-mourinho-takes-over-as-new-tottenham-hotspur-head-coach">replaced by former Manchester United and Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho on Wednesday</a>. And Klopp said Mourinho would have been eager to get back into management.</p>
      <p>"It's nice to have him back. He was desperate, you can see that from the time he was not in."</p>
      <p>Klopp also said that <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/173896/Mohamed-Salah">Mohamed Salah</a> is a doubt for Saturday's Premier League clash against Crystal Palace.</p>

      <p>"Yesterday he [Salah] trained," Klopp added. "He has been training the things we want him to do. It's not that he has got worse, it's just that it is there still [injury].</p>
      <p>"We have to be sensible. I have to see the session today before I make a decision."</p>
      <p>The Liverpool manager said that <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/157892/Virgil-van-Dijk">Virgil van Dijk</a> will be available, but added that <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/147234/Roberto-Firmino">Roberto Firmino</a>, <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/176287/Fabinho">Fabinho</a> and <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/98342/Georginio-Wijnaldum">Georginio Wijnaldum</a> will be last-minute decisions as to whether they play on Saturday after arriving back late from international duty.</p>
      <p>"It's the time of year when players go out of the squad overnight with other things, like feeling sick.</p>
      <p>"Today [Friday] is a very important session especially with players who were back late."</p>
