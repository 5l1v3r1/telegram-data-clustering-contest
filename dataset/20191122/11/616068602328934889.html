      <p>As job losses pile up in the local modular home manufacturing industry, the City of Penticton and Work BC are hosting a job fair.</p>
      <p>The public is invited to the Work BC offices at 174-1848 Main St. on Nov. 26, 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Several local employers will be in attendance looking to fill “outstanding” job openings.</p>
      <p>Metric Modular laid off 20 employees earlier this month, with workers telling Castanet the future of the plant is in question. Moduline also laid off about half its workforce in March. Both companies blamed a drop in new orders.</p>
      <p>“The regional unemployment rate remains quite low at 4.5 per cent and local employers I speak with continue to indicate the need for new employees.  This event is an opportunity to provide those who are recently out of work employment opportunities and perhaps a new career choice,” said city economic development specialist Andrew Kemp</p>
      <p>“Providing opportunity and proactively engaging with our local employers is a focus of our local Economic Development Department”, said Mayor Vassilaki.  “This is a great event for those looking to get back to work while continuing to live in our beautiful City.”</p>
      <p>Metric Modular president Stephen Branch thanked the city for hosting the job fair, “we want to support our employees in finding new opportunities in the community."</p>
