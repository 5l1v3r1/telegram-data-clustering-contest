      <h1>Jurgen Klopp has surprising Rhian Brewster transfer U-Turn – Report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:56:26+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp will now allow Rhian Brewster to leave the club on loan in January, says an ‘exclusive’ report by <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/exclusive-rhian-brewster-transfer-development-after-klopp-u-turn-at-liverpool/">Football Insider</a>, who claim to have received information from a Liverpool source.</p>
      <p>Liverpool refused to grant the 19-year-old a summer exit with the player himself stating the manager told him in no uncertain terms he’d be staying for the campaign…</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Yeah, I spoke to him at the beginning of the season and he just said ‘no’. He doesn’t want me to go on loan, he wants me to stay,” Brewster told FourFourTwo, cited in the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/what-jurgen-klopp-told-rhian-20170652">Star</a>, at the end of September.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“So that’s fair enough and it’s good to hear.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>But the young striker has only featured in the EFL Cup so far, playing 90 minutes against MK Dons and Arsenal and failing to score or assist in the process.</p>
      <p>He’ll be in the side that faces Aston Villa in the quarters, but the fact he has yet to be given a single minute in the Premier League or Champions League is strange considering the hype about his role this term before it began.</p>
      <p>The reality though is that Liverpool are top of the table and eight points clear and will win our Champions League group with an Anfield victory over Napoli midweek.</p>
      <p>With the current seniors performing so well, Klopp clearly doesn’t feel it’s time to blood young talent and has rightly prioritised winning over everything.</p>
      <p>Brewster though needs minutes – and a January loan – perhaps to a good Championship side and not a struggling Premier League one – might be the most sensible bet.</p>
