      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:01:02+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:01</time> by <a rel="author">Joyce Danso, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 21, GNA - An Accra Circuit court has ordered a mental assessment of a 19 year old student accused of frequent harassment of his step mother.</p>
      <p>The student has been charged with engaging in domestic violence to wit harassment.</p>
      <p>Prosecuting, Chief Inspector Kofi Atimbire told the court presided over by Mrs Rita Abrokwa-Doko that for the past two years the 66 year old woman has been harassed variously by her stepson.</p>
      <p>He said the accused known as James Williams had taken GH¢3,000.00 as compensation from his stepmom after behaving violently towards her.</p>
      <p>The prosecution said Williams also works as a factory hand at his stepmom’s factory where he is paid GH¢360.00 a month.</p>
      <p>The court observed a strange behavior when after the prosecution called the accused as James Williams, he protested and said he is rather known as Isaac Arthur.</p>
      <p>The accused told the court his family had rejected him and that only one of his relatives know his real name.</p>
      <p>The court then ordered that a mental assessment should be carried out on Williams at the Psychiatric Hospital to enable the court to take a decision in respect of him.</p>
      <p>It further directed the case investigator to ensure that the medical expenses are bore by the step mother who is the complainant in the case.</p>
      <p>The prosecution said William, a student lives with the complainant Mariam B. Williams at New Achimota after the demise of his father.</p>
      <p>He said the accused allegedly took to smoking of Indian hemp and has been harassing the complainant to pay him ‘’Compensation” of GH¢3,000.00.</p>
      <p>The prosecution said after some back and forth the complainant gave Williams the GH¢3,000.00 and he left the house.</p>
      <p>He said the accused returned some few weeks later, pleading for forgiveness after squandering the money.</p>
      <p>The Prosecution said the complainant then employed him in her factory, but he started behaving violently to some of the complainant’s staff.</p>
      <p>He said when the complainant confronted him, he told the complainant he was going to teach her a lesson she would never forget.</p>
      <p>The Prosecution said this put fear in the complainant who then reported the matter to the Domestic Violence and Domestic Support Unit of the Ghana Police Service.</p>
      <p>The matter has been adjourned to December 4.</p>
