      <h1>True story behind Princess Anne and Andrew Parker Bowles' affair in The Crown</h1>
      <h2>Princess Anne and Andrew Parker Bowles romance features in season three of The Crown, but is it actually true?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:33:04+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author">Poppy Danby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/poppy-danby/</a></address>
      <p>It's a controversial storyline that has both shocked and intrigued fans of The Crown, but how true is the upcoming plot, about the illicit affair between Princess Anne and Andrew Parker Bowles?</p>
      <p>Andrew was a British army officer when he first met his wife, Camilla in 1965 at a debutante party.</p>
      <p>The pair hit it off immediately and dated on and off for eight years.</p>
      <p>However, royal sources claim that not everything was as smooth as it looked on the surface.</p>
      <p>It's believed that among other flings, Andrew sparked up an affair with Princess Anne in 1970 - when she was 20 and he was 31.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the podcast Royals, royal commentator Angela Mollard said: “It was well-known that Andrew Parker Bowles had multiple lovers.”</p>
      <p>She added: “This is really funny. Princess Anne, who we always think is the grumpy one with the bun - she had an affair with Andrew Parker Bowles.”</p>

      <p>And there's more evidence of the royal romance, in Tina Brown's biography, The Diana Chronicles.</p>
      <p>The journalist wrote: “Andrew adored women. And, like his father, he was a royal groupie.</p>
      <p>“One of his earlier diversions was a torrid affair with Princess Anne, who, in her stern way, has always enjoyed a roll in the hay.”</p>
      <p>However, the affair sparked something of a royal love triangle – as Camilla wanted to get revenge.</p>
      <p>And royal biographer, Penny Junor, has previously suggested that Camilla might never have started a relationship with Prince Charles, if her boyfriend wasn't romancing his sibling.</p>

      <p>She said: “[Camilla] was passionately in love with [Andrew] but he was a cad, he was bonking other people, some of her friends.</p>
      <p>“There was a lovely story when she was walking through London in the evening and spotted his car parked outside the flat of a very good friend of hers. So she let the tyres down and wrote a message in lipstick on his windscreen.</p>
      <p>“So when she was introduced to Charles and he thought she was pretty special...he thought she was a bit of alright and she thought, 'Andrew is at the moment off with Princess Anne, you know her brother, teach Andrew a lesson.' So she had a fling with Charles.”</p>

      <p>Camilla and Charles first met at a polo match in Windsor Great Park in 1970 and she allegedly told him:</p>
      <p>“My great-grandmother was the mistress of your great-great-grandather. I feel we have something in common.”</p>
      <p>But things got complicated and Junor recalled: “It was clear that Princess Anne was in love with Andrew Parker Bowles, Camilla was in love with him too, and Charles was in love with Camilla.”</p>

      <p>Things came to a head in 1973 when Andrew finally decided to ditch his womanising ways and marry Camilla.</p>
      <p>Princess Anne also married Mark Phillips later that year, and Charles and Diana married eight years later in 1981.</p>
      <p>However, the royals' love lives have remained intertwined. As Charles continued to hold a torch for Camilla, with the pair finally settling down and getting wed in 2005.</p>
