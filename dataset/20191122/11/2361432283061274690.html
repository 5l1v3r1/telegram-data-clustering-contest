      <h1>Justice Society of America to be Featured in DC Comics 'Black Adam' Film</h1>
      <h2>DC’s original superhero team debuted in 1940</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:27:07+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:27</time> by <a rel="author">Umberto Gonzalez, Ross A. Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>A blast from the DC Comics past is finally getting the big screen treatment, as The Justice Society of America will be featured in New Line’s upcoming “Black Adam,” star Dwayne Johnson said Thursday.</p>
      <p>During the press junket Thursday for “Jumanji: The Next Level,” Johnson told <a href="https://screenrant.com/black-adam-movie-jsa-justice-society-dceu/">Screenrant</a> that the film “will introduce you to that, the world to JSA.”</p>
      <p>Created by editor Sheldon Mayer and writer Gardner Fox in 1940 for All-Star Comics, the Justice Society of America is notable not only as the first superhero team in comic book history but, because it featured characters owned by both National Comics and All-Star Comics publisher All-American Publications, also as the first crossover between rival comic book companies.</p>
      <p>National contributed its characters Doctor Fate, Hour-Man, the Spectre, and the Wesley Dodd version of The Sandman (an entirely separate character from one created by Neil Gaiman in 1988). All-American meanwhile contributed The Atom (Al Pratt), the Jay Garrick version of The Flash, the Alan Scott version of Green Lantern, and the original Hawkman (Carter Hall).</p>

      <p>Eventually, National’s Superman and Batman were introduced as honorary members, and National’s Wonder Woman joined full time (unfortunately, she was written as the Justice Society’s secretary. Thanks, sexism). And by the end of 1945, National and All-American had merged to form the company now known as DC Comics.</p>
      <p>However, due to a general decline in readership for superhero comics, DC ceased publishing Justice Society adventures in 1951 and most characters associated with the team were retired. As interest in superheroes began to rise again later in the decade, Green Lantern and The Flash were rebooted as entirely new characters and in 1960, they were teamed up with Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Martian Manhunter to form the first version of the Justice League of America.</p>
      <p>DC ultimately explained the disappearance of JSA and most of its heroes with a 1961 “The Flash” story called “The Flash of Two Worlds,” which introduced the multiverse concept. JSA adventures were said to have taken place on Earth 2, which is why the then-current versions of DC’s heroes had no affiliation with the team. Later, with 1985’s “Crisis on Infinite Earths” crossover event that rebooted the entire DC Comics universe, it was established that the JSA was a precursor to the Justice League that formed during World War II; that remains the team’s official history in the DC Comics universe to this day.</p>

      <p>Production on “Black Adam,” is slated to begin in June. Johnson will produce the film with Dany Garcia and Hiram Garcia via their Seven Bucks Productions banner, along with Beau Flynn and executive producer Scott Sheldon of FlynnPictureCo. Jaume Collet-Serra will direct.</p>
      <p>Though the character is one of Shazam’s greatest enemies, Johnson didn’t show up as Black Adam in David F. Sandberg’s “Shazam!” earlier this year; the explanation at the time was that both characters required their own introduction in separate films. But the character was teased when the Wizard first summons Billy Batson to the Rock of Eternity, and tells the story of a champion he had selected thousands of years earlier, who became a force for evil and destruction instead of good. A golden hologram appears inside the Rock of Eternity as the Wizard tells the story, clearly showing the previous champion to be Black Adam.</p>
      <p>“Black Adam” will hit theaters on Dec. 22, 2021.</p>

          <figcaption><b>34. "Superman IV: The Quest for Peace" (1987)<br/></b>Christopher Reeve is by far the best Superman. But "Superman IV" is a bomb in every sense -- partly because of its heavy-handedness about bombs. Nuclear bombs. The film finds Superman trying to eliminate the world's nuclear threat, but his best intentions run afoul of a silly, badly dated villain named Nuclear Man.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>33. "Supergirl" (1984)<br/></b>We had a female-superhero movie in 1984, and it was pure cheese. But hey, at least they tried. The best thing I can say about it is there are worse things in life than this movie.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>32. "Suicide Squad" (2016)<br/></b>Less a movie than it is a fever dream of unrelated sequences and montages that somehow end up using more than two hours of your time. Totally incomprehensible experience.<br/>And, no, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/does-suicide-squad-extended-cut-fix-movie-nope/">the extended cut doesn't do anything that warrants improving its standing</a>.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>26. "Batman &amp; Robin" (1997)<br/></b>Rightly hated, but it's tremendously entertaining here and there. <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/uma_thurman/">Uma Thurman</a> and Arnold Schwarzeneggar are going so far over the top I can't help but admire them.</figcaption>

There was also a weird bit about a weather satellite creating bad weather, which isn't what weather satellites do. Seeing Clark Kent fight Superman was pretty cool, though.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>24. "Green Lantern" (2011)<br/></b>Overreliance on cartoony visual effects during a period when big blockbusters were moving away from that aesthetic meant this was a movie nobody liked. Not that it was especially horrible. It just looked like a dumb cartoon and is hard to watch.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>23. "The Dark Knight Rises" (2012)<br/></b>Probably wasn't intended to be a grim and gritty Shumacher Batmovie, but that is indeed what it is. This is Nolan going full Hollywood, smashing plot points into place by sheer force of will rather than because they make sense. An extremely theatrical <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/tom_hardy/">Tom Hardy</a> as Bane is amusing front to back, and a nuke with a countdown clock on it will never get old.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>22. "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" (2016)<br/></b>A total mess that hates Superman and turns Batman into a total maniac. None of those things are good. <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/ben_affleck/">Ben Affleck</a> can't save the thing, but he's excellent nonetheless and gives it a huge bump it probably doesn't deserve.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>21. "Watchmen" (2009)<br/></b>I have no particular affection for the revered "Watchmen" comic the way a lot of other nerds do, so my distaste for this adaptation isn't personal. It just doesn't add up to nearly as much as it thinks it does.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>20. "Batman" (1989)<br/></b>Fondly remembered mostly because it was the first Batmovie in a couple decades. It isn't actually very good, though.

          <figcaption><b>17. "Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition" (2016)<br/></b>Giving this its own slot because it fundamentally changes the narrative of the movie and the character of Superman in the DC Extended Universe.

"The Dark Knight" (2008)<br/></b>Should be way shorter, but <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/heath_ledger/">Heath Ledger</a>'s Joker is far and away the best villain in any of these movies. Ledger elevates what would otherwise be just another self-indulgent <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/christopher_nolan/">Christopher Nolan</a> exercise into an endlessly watchable picture.</figcaption>

There are different edits of this movie, and we frankly can't keep them straight. But the sight of a powerless Clark getting beat up in a diner made Superman as sympathetic as he's ever been.</figcaption>

And the standard DC Extended Universe problem of "We gotta have a nonsensical CGI battle at the end." But despite those caveats it's an enormous delight, and a big step forward for the DCEU.</figcaption>

John Williams' score soars, and so does the believable and compelling romance between Superman and Lois Lane. The film convincingly blended camp (in the form of <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/gene_hackman/">Gene Hackman</a>'s wonderful Lex Luthor), an epic origin story that actually felt epic, and funny lines. The scene in which Supes and Lois fly together is one of the most beautiful metaphors for new love ever captured on film.</figcaption>

Watching it again recently, I found it functions almost perfectly as a parody of the super-serious <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/christopher_nolan/">Christopher Nolan</a> Batfilms, which is incredible.</figcaption>
