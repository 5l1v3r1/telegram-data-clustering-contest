      <p>A young Plymouth dad who was diagnosed with Motor Neurone disease at the age of just 24 is set to marry this weekend - after the generosity of local businesses helped to make the day happen.</p>
      <p>In January, Plymouth Live told of how Jon Adams was <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/plymouth-dad-given-heartbreaking-diagnosis-2463729">diagnosed with the terminal illness</a> after experiencing symptoms at just 22.</p>
      <p>Since then, he has become a dad to baby Arthur with his girlfriend Holly, and the pair are just days away from tying the knot.</p>
      <p>"From the bottom of my heart all I can say is thank you to everyone that has helped out with the wedding, no matter how big or small," Jon said.</p>
      <p>"People's kindness and generosity shows that not only do they support you but they truly care and it's so heartwarming to see."</p>
      <p>Jon's mum Alison also wishes to thank everyone that has contributed to the day after a particularly tough year for the family.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, Jon's sister Abbie set up a JustGiving page to ensure her brother was able to complete a bucket list while he's still fit enough to do so, and the family have plans to donate the other half of the funds to the MND Association Plymouth.</p>
      <p>Jon is one of about 5,000 people living in the UK with Motor Neurone Disease, which affects the neurons in the brain and spinal cord.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately there is no cure for the devastating illness and sufferers can go from fit and healthy to tetraplegic within a matter of months.</p>

      <h3>What is Motor Neurone Disease?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Motor neurone disease (MND) is a uncommon condition that affects the brain and nerves. It causes weakness that gets worse over time.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's caused by a problem with cells in the brain and nerves called motor neurones. These cells gradually stop working over time. It's not known why this happens.</p>
      <p>Moving around, swallowing and breathing get increasingly difficult, and treatments like a feeding tube or breathing air through a face mask may be needed.</p>
      <p>The condition is eventually fatal, but how long it takes to reach this stage varies a lot. A few people live for many years or even decades with motor neurone disease.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>"Since my diagnosis, I have no had to give up work permanently due to the condition," Jon said.</p>
      <p>"The mobility in my arms has become quite bad to the point where there is not much strength in them and daily tasks become very difficult for me.</p>
      <p>"My walking has also got worse but I am determined to stay on my feet for as long as possible, only using a wheelchair when needed.</p>

      <p>"My speech has slightly changed as the muscles inside of inside of my mouth are not working as well so I have a bit of a slur, but trying to look at the positives, my respiratory is all in perfect condition as said by the doctors.</p>
      <p>"As for my mental state, I have good days and bad days but I remain as positive as I can be as I am now a father and my little boy keeps me going as well as my beautiful wife to be." </p>
      <p>Plymouth Live wishes Jon and Holly all the best on their wedding day.</p>
