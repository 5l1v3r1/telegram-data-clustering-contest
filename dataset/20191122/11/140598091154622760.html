      <h1>Europe's 10 best budget ski resorts: top holiday deals for 2019/20</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/t/telegraph-ski/" target="_blank">Telegraph Ski</a></address>
      <p>Getting <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/advice/ski-holiday-hacks-that-can-save-you-money-this-winter/">value for money</a> on holiday is high on the list of most skiers and snowboarders. Staying away from the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/resort-guides/the-top-20-ski-resorts-voted-by-readers/">famous, fashionable resorts</a>, where everything from lift passes and accommodation to lunch on the mountain are likely to cost the most, is the obvious advice.</p>
      <p>However, while a more <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/galleries/The-best-ski-resorts-youve-probably-never-heard-of/">obscure resort</a> may cost less, it can also mean a much smaller ski area, lower altitude and hence <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/Ski-snow-forecast-and-reports/">less chance of good snow</a>. Since most of us are reluctant to compromise on the good times, while many of the resorts in this line-up may be unfamiliar, they are not necessarily the cheapest. Rather they offer value for money plus a quality experience. There may be compromises to be made somewhere – a longer transfer time from the airport, lifts that are slower and less comfortable, a base village that is far from the chocolate box ideal for example – but the money savings over bigger-name destinations should make them well worth the trip.  </p>
      <p>
        <i>Unless stated otherwise, prices are per person, based on two sharing a double or twin room, half-board,  for seven nights, including flights and transfers.</i>
      </p>
      <h4>Best for hitting the park or the heli</h4>
      <h3>Livigno, Italy</h3>
      <p>The Italian resort of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/resort-guides/italy/livigno/">Livigno</a> is set in a high, wide, remote valley close to the Swiss border, meaning that airport transfers to get here are long and winding. It takes the best part of three hours to get there from Innsbruck, and even longer from<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/Best-Italian-ski-resorts/"> Italian</a> hub airports. However, it’s worth the long journey, not only for its low prices but also for the quality of its parks and reliable snow cover. Most of the slopes are above the tree line, and Livigno is known as ‘Little Tibet’ because of its height and remoteness. Livigno suits those on a tight budget partly because it has a special tax status that dates back to Napoleonic times. There’s no VAT, which makes drinks, petrol and consumer goods some of the<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/revealed-kranjska-gora-the-best-value-family-ski-resort/"> cheapest</a> in Europe. Many of the old wooden houses in the traffic-free village centre have been converted into atmospheric bars, restaurants and clubs.</p>
      <p>The remote village is strung out along 10km of mountain road that comes to a full stop in winter at a heady 1,816m, close to the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/Switzerlands-best-ski-resorts/">Swiss</a> border. It’s a great area for beginners and low <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/The-best-ski-resorts-for-intermediates/">intermediates</a>, with terrain on both the Mottolino and Costaccia/Carosello sides of the valley, and has a long, snowsure season lasting from November to May.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/ski/Resorts/budget-livigno.jpg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>Livigno, Italy, is a three-hour drive from Innsbruck</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>For experts, Livigno is embracing freeriding with the Freeride Project, a series of managed off-piste routes, mostly off the back of Mottolino. Every Sunday from 6pm to 7.30pm the resort organises meetings at the Birrificio Livigno (the local brewery), where freeride experts advise on safe off-piste, the equipment needed (which includes transceiver, probe and shovel) and how to check the daily avalanche report. Although the words heliskiing and affordable don’t usually appear in the same sentence, Livigno presents a rare opportunity for both.</p>
      <p>Livigno is one of Europe’s best resorts for terrain parks – hence it being chosen to host the freestyle and snowboarding events of the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics. The main <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/best-ski-resorts-for-terrain-parks/">terrain park</a> is on Mottolino, with kickers to suit all abilities and a superpipe. There are also rails, and an airbag for perfecting tricks. The second main park, at Carosello, is geared more towards intermediates. It also has a large airbag, rails and tabletops, plus a boardercross course. Two more parks – Amerikan, near the Carosello gondola, and Del Sole, near the centre of town – are aimed at beginners and children. Cable Park, in the Costaccia sector, has a variety of rails, boxes and jumps of varying difficulty. A dedicated cable tow pulls riders through the park, making tricks easier.</p>
      <h4>Where to stay</h4>
      <p>Just a short walk from the Carosello gondola, and with a reputation for good food, the three-star Hotel Cristallo is convenient and comfortable. From £750, bed and breakfast, with <a href="https://www.sno.co.uk/">SNO</a>.</p>
      <h4>Best for beginners</h4>
      <h3>Alpbach, Austria</h3>
      <p>Beginners don’t need the complexity of a large resort, so a novice’s visit to this Tirolean chocolate-box with oodles of atmosphere – it regularly wins prizes as the prettiest village in<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/Best-Austrian-ski-resorts/"> Austria</a> – should result in a lifetime of piste enthusiasm. Alpbach has a special relationship with the British that began more than 50 years ago when a Major Billy Patterson came here on leave and enjoyed the pistes and the pubs. He told his army friends and they told others. Thousands of British have since learnt the basics here, and many return year after year. It’s also great value for money – prices are low, even by Austrian standards.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/ski/Alpbach-Children-skiing-%28c%29-Alpbachtal-Seenland-Tourismus.jpg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>Alpbach is a good choice for beginners</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>A single nursery slope in the village centre is ideal for practising after lessons, but the main ski area is a five-minute bus, then a gondola, away. Of the three ski schools in the resort, <a href="http://skischule-alpbach.at/">Alpbach‑Inner Alpbach</a> is the original learning establishment, while <a href="http://alpbach-aktiv.com/">Alpbach Aktiv</a> and <a href="http://skialpbach.com/">Skischule Alpbachtal</a> also have fine reputations. During the resort’s dedicated family weeks, under-15s get a free lift pass.</p>
      <p>Alpbach’s ski area is linked to that of Auffach in the neighbouring Wildschönau valley, together they form the Ski Juwel ski area. Despite this expansion Alpbach itself, only a 40-minute drive from Innsbruck airport, has remained remarkably unchanged over the years. The only difference is that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/The-best-ski-resorts-for-intermediates/">intermediates</a> who might otherwise have moved on now have the incentive to return to explore the respectable 109km of pistes served by 45 lifts  in the two valleys.</p>
      <h4>Where to stay  </h4>
      <p>Haus Edelweiss is a traditional and informal family-run bed and breakfast, run by Frau Moser, close to the nursery slopes and bus stop. From £309, bed and breakfast, with <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/austria/the-ski-juwel-area/alpbach/haus-edelweiss">Inghams</a>. </p>
      <h4>Best for intermediate cruising</h4>
      <h3>Serre Chevalier, France</h3>
      <p>Think of this as the laid-back country cousin of A-list French resorts such as<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/resort-guides/Ski-Val-dIsere-resort-guide/"> Val d’Isère</a> or<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/resort-guides/Ski-Courchevel-resort-guide/"> Courchevel</a>. It’s smaller and less high-tech, but friendlier and more relaxed, with bags of character. There are cheaper <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/Best-French-ski-resorts/">French resorts</a>, but few can match Serre Che’s extent.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/resort-guides/france/serre-chevalier/">Serre Chevalier</a> is the collective name for a dozen villages along the road from the town of Briançon in the southern Alps. Monêtier Les Bains is the pick of the main villages, a picturesque spa resort with a fast chairlift into the western end of the ski area – it’s quieter and altogether more charming to stay in than the others, Villeneuve and Chantemerle.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Serre Chevalier will keep intermediate entertained Credit: © Luka Leroy/Luka Leroy</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The ski area is split up into four distinct sectors and makes a delightful playground for intermediates of all standards, giving a real feeling of travelling around. The resort used to claim 250km of pistes but now says 410 hectares of pistes instead, including the uphill areas used for lifts. Whichever, it is a big ski area with more than enough terrain for a week’s holiday.</p>
      <p>If you’re stuck on a plateau, as well as the ESF, there are lots of other schools to choose from and most have very good reputations. British ski school <a href="https://www.skinewgen.com/">New Generation</a> is run here by BASI-qualified Gavin Crosby, who offer group lessons, private coaching and guiding throughout the season. Book well in advance.</p>
      <h4>Where to stay</h4>
      <p>Modern and close to the Pontillas lift on the outskirts of Villeneuve, with slopes back to the door, Residence Aquisana offers 76 one- and two-bedroom apartments sleeping from four to six. There’s a heated pool and steam room. From £184 per person self-catering based on four sharing, including Eurotunnel crossing, with<a href="http://www.zenithholidays.co.uk/"> Zenith Holidays</a>.</p>
      <h4>Best for partying</h4>
      <h3>Pas de la Casa, Andorra</h3>
      <p>Pas, as it’s known to its denizens, has grown up at high altitude on the duty‑free side of the French/Andorran border. While it is isn’t the most attract resort it has a reputation for<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/Best-ski-resorts-for-apres-ski/"> wild partying</a>.</p>
      <p>Part of the extensive Grandvalira ski area, which includes <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/resort-guides/Ski-Soldeu-resort-guide/">Soldeu</a>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/resort-guides/ski-pas-de-la-casa--resort-guide/">Pas de la Casa</a> has slopes best suited to confident intermediates. Separated from the rest of the principality by a mountain wall, it has largely missed the facelift that has taken a lot of Andorra’s other resorts upscale, so prices are welcomingly lower.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/ski/Resorts/pas-de-la-casa-resort.jpg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>Pas de la Casa is part of the Grandvalira ski area</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The nightlife in Pas has something to suit every taste and it is renowned for having a party atmosphere popular with stag and hen dos. A wide selection of pubs and clubs, including themed bars and a bar where you pour your own beers, stay open until the early hours – one of the resort’s pub crawls, which stop at many of the top establishments, is a recommended way to see it all. Thanks to Andorra’s duty-free status, a litre of vodka costs the bar less than a small can of Red Bull, so (within reason) they are literally giving it away. Count the cost of a night out in headache pills.</p>
      <p>La Perla Negra is a pirate‑themed bar with DJs, plus a pool table. KSB (Kamikaze Surf Bar) is a popular bar/restaurant/club with food served late. Underground Bar &amp; Club stays open late playing crowd-pleasing music, as does Bilbord, which is one of the largest and liveliest clubs in the resort. Watch your step on the way home – the streets are icy, steep, and patrolled by the police.</p>
      <h4>Where to stay</h4>
      <p>The four-star Font d’Argent is a shining exception to the usually simple accommodation options in Pas de la Casa. It’s a clean and smart hotel with a spa and pool, and it’s well placed for easy access to the slopes and the nightlife. From £619 with <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3206&amp;awinaffid=267473&amp;clickref=Best+Budget+Ski+Resorts+17&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inghams.co.uk%2F">Inghams</a>.</p>
      <h4>Best for getting away from it all</h4>
      <h3>Aussois, France</h3>
      <p>This unknown gem of a resort is tucked away in the Maurienne Valley n the edge of the Vanoise National Park. Despite concessions to tourism, the traditional village at the foot of the 3,700m Dent Parrachée makes an ideal base for anyone wanting to combine a winter-sports holiday with the ambience of rural France. Prices are far more sensible here than in the big-name destinations of the neighbouring Tarentaise Valley, such as like Courchevel and Val d’Isère.</p>
      <p>With just 55km of slopes, Aussois itself is not a place for those who want a huge daily mileage and is best suited to those looking for easy beginner and intermediate skiing. There are other larger Maurienne resorts nearby, including La Norma, easily reached on the other side of the valley. A little further afield, more extensive terrain is available at Val Cenis, Valfréjus and Bonneval. A lift pass which includes access to them along with free shuttle buses is available.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/news/the-rise-of-non-skiers-in-ski-resorts/">Non-skiing/snowboarding activities</a> include snowshoeing, paragliding, ice climbing, exploring the surrounding plateau by dogsled or tobogganing. Bessans, a 40-minute drive away, has a huge cross-country skiing centre.</p>
      <h4>Where to stay</h4>
      <p>The ski-in/ski-out Résidence les Flocons d’Argent is at the foot of the slopes and near the ski school meeting point, with an indoor pool. From £119, based on five people self-catering in a two-bedroom apartment and including FlexiPlus Eurotunnel crossings for self-drive, with <a href="https://www.peakretreats.co.uk/">Peak Retreats</a>.</p>
      <h4>Best for value in Switzerland</h4>
      <h3>Val d'Anniviers, Switzerland</h3>
      <p>The rule about getting away from the high‑profile, fashionable resorts to find good value is particularly applicable in pricey<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/Switzerlands-best-ski-resorts/"> Switzerland</a>. In this respect, it’s difficult to beat the four resorts of Grimentz, Zinal, St Luc and Chandolin in the Val d’Anniviers valley. The villages are traditional and small-scale, and Grimentz and St Luc in particular have charming old-fashioned town centres.</p>
      <p>Prices in the valley are about 25 per cent lower than in the big, better-known Swiss resorts. There are cheaper places to be found in Switzerland, but most people on a week-long winter-sports trip will find that Val d’Anniviers delivers more. Crucially, the two ski areas – Grimentz-Zinal on one side of the valley, St Luc-Chandolin on the other – deliver the quantity and variety of pistes likely to keep visitors occupied for the duration of a week’s holiday.</p>
      <p>In 2014 the link between Grimentz and Zinal was improved by the installation of a cable car costing 28 million CHF, cutting the journey time to eight minutes – previously a bus was the only route back to Zinal. This serious investment was partly aimed at increasing the ski area’s appeal to intermediates, who can now more easily get piste-cruising value from the 75km of long, mainly red runs covered by the valley lift pass.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/Val-dAnniviers-where-hidden-powder-is-king/">Val d’Anniviers</a> was an early adopter in the freeride revolution – in 2002, a transceiver search park and an avalanche-controlled (but not patrolled) freeride zone opened in Zinal. Since then, more avalanche-protected itinerary runs have opened throughout the valley. <a href="http://backcountryadventures.co.uk/">Grimentz-Zinal Backcountry Adventure</a>s runs guided off-piste day tours in the area.</p>
      <h4>Where to stay</h4>
      <p>Hotel Bella Tola is a traditional four-star in a building that dates to the 19th century – it was the resort’s first hotel and the interior reflects its history, with a period dining room, library and great chandeliers. From £1,190, bed and breakfast, with <a href="https://www.skisolutions.com/accommodations/bella-tola">Ski Solutions</a>. </p>
      <h4>Best for clocking up the miles</h4>
      <h3>Söll, Austria</h3>
      <p>It’s not difficult to find low-cost in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/Best-Austrian-ski-resorts/">Austria</a>, if you compromise on either the quality or quantity of the slopes. There are dozens of small villages with loads of charm but limited terrain and lift systems. Yet, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/resort-guides/Ski-Soll-resort-guide/">Söll</a> has much more to offer – one of the largest ski areas in Austria, plus plenty of budget accommodation.</p>
      <p>The traditional Tirolean village is set in the middle of a wide valley and is the unofficial capital of the SkiWelt, a dozen villages with 90 lifts and over 284km of largely intermediate pistes. The region is also directly linked through Westendorf and Kirchberg to<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/resort-guides/Ski-Kitzbuhel-resort-guide/"> Kitzbühel</a>. This adds another 54 lifts and 179km to the tally, though on a separate lift pass.</p>

        <figcaption>Söll is part of the SkiWelt area Credit: WWW.GRIASSDI.COM/CHRISTIAN KAPFINGER:</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>A decade ago Söll was best-known for its raucous laddish nightlife. But with the highest density of hotel beds in the region, it is now trying to appeal to a much wider clientele, including <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/The-best-family-ski-resorts/">families</a>. Nevertheless, it’s best suited to those who want to attack the slopes with gusto, or to party – or both.</p>
      <h4>Where to stay</h4>
      <p>At the Hotel Gänsleit, Austrian Rosi and her English husband Steve combine the familiarity of home with genuine Austrian hospitality and style, and a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. The hotel has been beautifully decorated and includes a modern spa and wellness suite. From £779 with <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7937954/type/dlg/http:/www.crystalski.co.uk/">Crystal</a> Ski Holidays.</p>
      <h4>Best for adventurers</h4>
      <h3>Jasna, Slovakia</h3>
      <p>This is the largest and most challenging ski area in<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/ski-off-piste-jasna-slovakia/"> Slovakia</a>, a 45-minute drive from the nearest airport at Poprad. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/resort-guides/slovakia/jasna/">Jasná</a>, (pronounced Yaznah), has sufficient terrain and facilities to keep even advanced skiers and snowboarders happy for up to a week. Slovakia offers amazing value for money compared with mainstream Alpine resorts. You can get good rooms in four-star hotels with extensive wellness facilities from around €50 b&amp;b per person for two people sharing. A pint of beer costs €3 or less, many main course meals €8 to €10.</p>
      <p>The first ski lift was opened in 1949 and most of the resort buildings were built since then. It has grown into a fair-sized ski area with 28 lifts and 49km of pistes, most of them suiting intermediates best. It’s not a huge area by Alpine standards but it does have some outstanding off piste. Lifts rise from both sides of the mountain, and hotels, shops, bars and restaurants have sprung up around these bases. The pisted area covers both the north and south sides of 2,024m Mount Chopok. The south side is mostly blues and reds, while the north side accesses more challenging slopes. Measured against resorts in the Alps, the 49km of pistes in Jasná might not sound like much, but there are also substantial free-ride zones as well as two terrain parks.  </p>

        <figcaption>Jasná is popular with freeriders</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>Where to stay</h4>
      <p>The Dragon’s Lair is a chalet-hotel with five en-suite bedrooms set down the valley from Jasna ski area. There’s in-house ski hire, a sauna, an outdoor hot tub, and massages and yoga can be arranged. On the ground floor is a bar open to the public. From £533, b&amp;b, including transfers, six-day lift pass (half-board can be provided for whole chalet bookings), excludes flights, with <a href="https://jasnaadventures.co.uk/">Jasna Advetures</a>. </p>
      <h4>Best for easy access</h4>
      <h3>Bareges/La Mongie, France</h3>
      <p>Only an hour from Lourdes airport (50km), or 90 minutes from Pau (110km), these two hugely contrasting resorts share the 100km of pistes in the Grand Tourmalet ski area - one of the biggest in the<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/Skiing-in-the-French-Pyrenees/"> Pyrenees</a>. Package prices to these resorts can be half as much as in the French Alps.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/galleries/The-best-ski-resorts-youve-probably-never-heard-of/ski3/">Barèges</a> is a centuries-old spa town a bus ride from the lifts, while La Mongie, over the Col du Tourmalet pass (closed to cars in winter, frequently used in the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/galleries/ski-resorts-featured-in-tour-de-france/">Tour de France</a> during the summer), is a purpose-built ski station. It’s slightly lacking in charm, but is convenient for the slopes.</p>
      <p>The runs suit intermediates best, but there’s also some challenging off piste, including from the Pic du Midi observatory (where it’s possible to stay the night), reached by cable car from La Mongie. The terrain above La Mongie is open and treeless and includes black runs that are considered to be among the toughest in the French Pyrenees. The slopes in Barèges are gentler and tree-lined, but are much smaller in area.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Where to stay</h4>
      <p>Le Pic du Midi residence sits just 300m from the slopes above La Mongie. All the self-catered apartments have south-facing balconies, plus there’s a swimming pool, wellness area, equipment shop and kids club. From €190, self catering for two nights, with <a href="https://www.pierreetvacances.com/gb-en">Pierre et Vancances</a>. </p>
      <h4>Best for combining old town and modern slopes</h4>
      <h3>Bansko, Bulgaria</h3>
      <p>Often named the cheapest resort in Europe, Bulgaria has <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/news/bansko-cheapest-family-ski-resort/">bargain-basement prices</a>, with package holidays, equipment hire, lift passes and lessons half the price or less than in the most expensive Alpine resorts, and food and drink a quarter of the cost.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/resort-guides/Ski-Bansko-resort-guide/">Bansko</a> is <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/The-best-ski-resorts-in-Eastern-Europe/">Bulgaria’s top resort</a> and is two-and-a-half-hour drive south of Sofia airport, in the Pirin Mountains, close to the Macedonian and Greek borders. On a clear day there are views of the Aegean Sea. </p>
      <p>The original town below the more recently constructed resort village features old stone buildings and cobbled streets and has always been popular with tourists. Bansko itself is a modern resort, with 75km of varied intermediate slopes covering two mountains and 16 lifts that include a six-person chairlift, four quad chairs and a gondola, which goes up to the main mountain from the top end of town. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/ski/Bansko_Bulgaria.jpg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>Bansko is Bulgaria's biggest resort</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The resort’s slopes cover two mountains. There’s enough variety to challenge intermediates for a week, provided the snow conditions are good. The slopes can be quiet and are well groomed but some pistes are not always open if the weather dictates.</p>
      <p>The utilitarian cafés and Dickensian-era shops that served the town centre before the advent of mass tourism have been replaced by boutiques, pizzerias and wine bars. There are also plenty of traditional pubs called mehanas, often with live music. Prices are low and, all in all, it’s a fun place with wild après. Greeks, Russians and a large number of Britons flock to Bansko, so it’s best to avoid the busy peak period between<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/best-christmas-ski-resorts/"> Christmas</a> and the end of February.</p>
      <h4>Where to stay</h4>
      <p>Four-star MPM Hotel Sport is in a ski-in/ski‑out location by the gondola base. It has a lively Irish pub and a wellness area with a large pool, hot tub, sauna, steam bath and gym. From £503 with <a href="http://bit.ly/2wjOupq">Balkan Holidays</a>.</p>
