      <p>He said: “The first time I did it I thought, ‘Shall I do it for the 200 egos in the room or for the 200 million watching at home?’</p>
      <p>“It’s no contest, and I try and make it a spectator sport.”</p>
      <p>The comedian said that despite his merciless mockery, he has never libelled anyone.</p>
      <p>He said: “I do have to show my script to a lawyer at the last minute. They don’t change anything because I know the law and what I can get away with.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never libelled anyone, and I’ve never had a complaint upheld!</p>
      <p>“People asked me why I go to so much trouble to offend people and I said, ‘It’s no trouble. It’s easy’.”</p>
      <p>The Graham Norton Show airs on BBC One tonight at 10.40pm.</p>
