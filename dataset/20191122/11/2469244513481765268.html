      <p>One of two recent victims of a heart attack in a Devon DIY store has called for a defibrillator to be installed in case it ever happens again.</p>
      <p>Jan Deverell, who works at B&amp;Q in Barnstaple, suffered a heart attack in the store and also witnessed another man have a heart attack there.</p>
      <p>The second incident happened in September and saw the man given CPR by the store's manager.</p>
      <p>The video above shows the Devon Air Ambulance pilot using great skill to land in the store's car park before transporting the man to the Royal Devon and Exeter hospital for further treatment.</p>

      <p>But now Jan wants to make sure any potential tragedy is avoided should anything like this happen again.</p>
      <p>She has set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/bampq-defibrillator-fund">GoFundMe crowdfunding page</a> with the hope of raising Â£1,500 for a defibrillator in the store.</p>
      <p>On the page it says: "A few weeks ago we had an unfortunate incident at our B&amp;Q store in Barnstaple where a gentleman needed CPR by the store manager and then needed the air ambulance to transport him to Exeter.</p>
      <p>"The gentleman, I am pleased to say, is on the road to recovery. After having a heart attack myself in the store and having witnessed this last event and seeing how many customers come through our doors, I feel very strongly about getting a defibrillator in our store for any future incidents that may occur.</p>
      <p>"So I am asking all of you good people, wherever you are, to donate anything you can to help me achieve this.</p>
      <p>"I am also selling books in store so any books you might have would be well recieved.</p>

      <p>"I love our customers at B&amp;Q so i would love, with your help, to give something back and have this available to give our customers that need extra support if ever it was needed."</p>
      <p>A B&amp;Q spokesperson said: "We are proud to be working with the charity Hand on Heart this November and December to fundraise for defibrillators in our stores nationwide.</p>
      <p>"This is a great opportunity for us to support our local communities and to sustain this, we will also be launching B&amp;Q GoodHome Foundation, a registered charity to give grants to local community groups, as well as continuing our support for Shelter."</p>
