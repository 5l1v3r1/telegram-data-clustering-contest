      <p>Boxing legend <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/FloydMayweather">Floyd Mayweather</a> has hinted that he may come of retirement in 2020 to fight in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ufc">UFC</a>.</p>
      <p>Mayweather, 42, suggested he was in talks with UFC president <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/dana-white">Dana White</a>, before appearing to confirm that he was again coming out of retirement next year with a post on Instagram.</p>
      <p>“Dana White and I are working together again to bring the world another spectacular event in 2020,” he initially said on the social media platform.</p>
      <p>He then posted a second picture, with the caption: “Coming out of retirement in 2020.”</p>
      <p>Mayweather last fought Japanese kickboxer <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/tenshin-nasukawa">Tenshin Nasukawa</a> in an exhibition boxing match.</p>
      <p>That December 2018 fight was reportedly worth £7 million.</p>
      <p>Mayweather had previously extended his perfect career record to 50 career fights unbeaten with victory over <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a>, who had never previously boxed professionally.</p>
      <p>The duel with the UFC superstar supposedly earned Mayweather a potential £230 million.</p>
