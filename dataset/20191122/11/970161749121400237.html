      <p>Rachel Riley was hit with major backlash for erasing Jeremy Corbyn’s anti-apartheid message with a Photoshopped t-shirt.</p>
      <p>But the 33-year-old didn’t seem to be shaken by the drama as she headed out for a date night with husband Pasha Kovalev.</p>
      <p>Rachel and Pasha – who are expecting their first baby in a matter of weeks – attended the Grassroots Soccer World Aids Day Charity Gala together on Thursday night, and were all smiles as they rocked up to Lindley Hall.</p>
      <p>The pregnant star shimmered in a striped sequinned dress in blues and golds, while she wore a coat over her shoulders and wore metallic stilettos.</p>

      <p>The couple didn’t appear to be flustered by the social media storm caused by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/rachel-riley-sparks-backlash-erasing-jeremy-corbyns-anti-apartheid-message-photoshopped-t-shirt-11192944/">Rachel’s t-shirt</a> earlier that day.</p>
      <p>The Countdown star, who has been vocal in her opposition to Corbyn over allegations of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, wore a t-shirt during the Leaders Debate on Tuesday night that showed a photo of Corbyn being arrested on an anti-apartheid protest in 1984.</p>
      <p>However, Rachel’s t-shirt saw Corbyn holding a Photoshopped placard reading: ‘Jeremy Corbyn is a racist endeavour.’</p>

      <p>The original picture shows Corbyn holding a sign reading: ‘Defend the right to demonstrate against apartheid; join this picket.’</p>
      <p>Many accused Riley of erasing Corbyn’s anti-racism message, with calls for her to be sacked from Channel 4.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/rachel-riley-claims-highlighting-jeremy-corbyns-history-racism-photoshopped-t-shirt-11194388/">Rachel has stood by her statement</a>, tweeting: ‘The ease at which large swathes of people can be mobilised into group hate, for highlighting Corbyn’s history of racism using an image of his arrest as part of an extreme group cited as damaging the mainstream anti-apartheid movement, is just one reason Jewish people are worried.</p>
      <p>‘Trying to brand me as racist for this, whist lauding themselves as anti-racist heroes, shows just how little regard many people have for anti-Jewish racism, and why I and many others speak so loudly. It’s a hatred which unites the far right, far left and is having a resurgence.</p>

      <p>‘I won’t dignify this with any further response &amp; I won’t tolerate abuse from those who choose to rank one form of racism over another, that’s hypocrisy. They’re all unacceptable. End of.’</p>
