      <p>The one-off match will take place at Hampden in a bid to reach the Nations League play-off final for a place in the Euros.</p>
      <p>The game will take place on Thursday, March 26 during the next international break.</p>

      <p>However, we now know that it's Israel that will travel to Hampden.</p>
      <p>Although, Scotland will be away to either Norway or Serbia in the Nations League final should they make it.</p>
      <p>Boss Steve Clarke said: "We are looking forward to the home semi-final against Israel in what is a hugely exciting challenge for us with a massive reward. The players know Israel well having faced them in the Nations League.</p>
      <p>"It was a tough match over there but we showed our capabilities with a good win at Hampden last year.</p>
      <p>“This is the time to believe. We have just finished what was a difficult campaign, having experienced a turbulent few years for players, fans and managers alike.</p>
      <p>"It’s now time to channel the positivity following our recent results and focus on the semi-final in March first and foremost.</p>
      <p>“We have three wins in a row and the benefit of momentum. We need to channel that positivity and focus on the many attributes we have.</p>
      <p>"To have more than 50,000 people cheering us on at Hampden for the semi-final and the whole country watching at home is something that really excites me and will only serve as further inspiration to the players.</p>

      <p>“We want to be active participants at EURO 2020, not just hosts, and we will give our all in what I believe will be two games.</p>
      <p>"The Scotland fans always travel in their numbers and I hope they will do so once again if we were to reach the final, but for the moment our focus will be on the semi-final first and foremost."</p>
      <p>Although, as <i>SunSport</i> revealed yesterday, they <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4978855/euro-2020-scotland-england-france-portugal-group-of-death/">face a nightmare group of death if they make the tournament proper</a>.</p>
      <p>The Dark Blues could come up against England, France AND Portugal in the early stages of the major finals.</p>
      <p>Scotland are guaranteed to be paired with England in Group D - who are top seeds - due to Hampden and Wembley being host pairings.</p>
      <p>A slightly less daunting route for the Scots would be facing England, Poland and Czech Republic.</p>

      <p>The 24 teams that qualify for Euro 2020 are seeded based on their performances during the qualifiers.</p>
      <p>The ten group winners take the first ten positions, followed by the ten runners up, all ranked by points, goal difference and goals scored to determine their final pot.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Northern Ireland will host the Republic of Ireland for a spot at Euro 2020 if they both with their play-off semi-finals.</p>
      <p>NI will travel to Bosnia-Herzegovina first of all though while Mick McCarthy's side will take on Slovakia away.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Celtic skipper <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4981689/celtic-fc-news-scotland-scott-brown/">Scott Brown has refused to rule out a sensational Scotland return at the Euros.</a></p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> skipper quit the international scene for a second time in February 2018.</p>
      <p>But Brown, 34, has left the door open to pulling on the national shirt again if Steve Clarke’s side make it through March’s play-offs.</p>
      <p>Asked if Clarke was to sound him out, Brown said: “They still have two games to get through but you never say never.</p>
      <p>“It would be phenomenal to get to a finals after 22 years. Football’s a funny game and you never know.</p>
      <p>“I’m in a good place fitness-wise in terms of my body and I make sure I keep myself ticking over."</p>
