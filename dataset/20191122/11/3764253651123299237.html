      </p>
      <p>Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi has been a consistent performer for both club and country this year.</p>
      <p>Alex Iwobi who now plays for Everton in the Premier League also played an important role for Nigeria at the 2019 AFCON.</p>
      <p>Although goalkeeper Francis Uzoho was not the first choice for Nigeria at the 2019 AFCON, but his superb performance against Tunisia in the third place match won the heart of the fans.</p>
      <p>Francis Uzoho was Nigeria's first choice in the international friendly match against Brazil before he sustained an injury and was replaced with Maduka Okoye in the tie.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Caf best XI will be announced in a ceremony on January 7, 2020.</p>
      <p>Earlier, <b>Legit.ng</b> had reported how Super Eagles shot-stopper Francis Uzoho will count on world’s football governing body FIFA for his salary during the <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1267205-francis-uzoho-fifa-pay-shot-stoppers-salary-6-month-injury.html">period he will be on the sidelines.</a></p>
      <p>According to reports, the Deportivo de La Coruña-owned shot-stopper is expected to miss action for a minimum of six months, no thanks to a fracture of the meniscus and the anterior cruciate ligament of his left knee during Nigeria's Super Eagles friendly with Brazil’s Selecao</p>
