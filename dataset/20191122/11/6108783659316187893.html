      <p>The <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/surface-earbuds/">Surface Earbuds</a> have been delayed into 2020, Microsoft has today confirmed.</p>
      <p>Originally expected in late 2019 — that’s right about now — Microsoft advised that the earbuds need more work before their release.</p>
      <p>“Product-making is about the relentless pursuit to get all the details right, which takes time,” Microsoft’s Panos Panay <a href="https://twitter.com/panos_panay/status/1197575990194520065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">wrote on Twitter</a>. “Sometimes more than we planned on. To ensure we deliver the best possible experience for you, our fans &amp; customers, Surface Earbuds will now launch worldwide in Spring 2020.”</p>
      <p>That’s spring 2020 in the USA, so around March-April or thereabouts.</p>
      <p>The Surface Earbuds, shown above, will feature a touch interface and are priced at $249 USD.</p>
      <p>We’ll have more on the Surface Earbuds as information is shared. <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/here-are-all-todays-microsoft-surface-announcements/">The headphones were announced as part of the new Surface line back in October</a>.</p>
