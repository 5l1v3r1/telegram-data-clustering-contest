      <p>The follower, identified as Francis Eluozo tweeted, “Who else misses @BankyW the singer? I love @BankyW the actor, the politician, the activist but please sir still give us music. If you don’t want to do again, for goodness sake can you just make even if its one song a year, just one #@#@.”</p>
      <p>In his response, the EME boss stated that be would be dropping an album in 2020, while wondering if many of his followers feel the way Eluozo feels.</p>
      <p>Banky W tweeted, “#$$$ Okay.. I’m gonna do at least one more album, in 2020. Not sure if there are too many ppl who feel the same as you do, but thanks for this. I appreciate it.”</p>
      <p>Recall that the singer has been off radar for quite a while, as <a href="http://concisenews.global/2019/02/27/we-were-greatly-outnumbered-but-we-stood-out-banky-w/">he ventured into politics.</a></p>
      <p>Banky W was the House of Representatives candidate for Modern Development Party in the 2019 elections.</p>
