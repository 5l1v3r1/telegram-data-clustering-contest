        <b>Megastar Amitabh Bachchan, on his quiz show Kaun Banega Crorepati 11, recently praised Kangana Ranaut. While Big B is known for praising actors in the film industry, he hailed Kangana as the number one actress</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kaun Banega Crorepati 11 host and megastar Amitabh Bachchan is everybody’s favorite host and often shares interesting anecdotes and tidbits from his life on the show. Big B is known to be very humble and is often seen praising actors in the film industry and only ever has kind words for them. He is appreciative of their talents and their hard work, and now on the show, he was all praise for Manikarnika actress Kangana Ranaut. Calling her the number one, he showered her with compliments.</p>
      <p>In a recent episode of KBC 11, Kangana Ranaut’s voice was played and Amitabh Bachchan asked which actress’ voice it was. The options given were Ameesha Patel, Kangana Ranaut, Preity Zinta, and Kriti Sanon. The audio was one from Kangana Ranaut’s interview in which she said, “I’ve received offers from so many parties. Even my grandfather was a big politician. But I have willingly not accepted (those offers) because I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to be a politician. I want to be a filmmaker. And that’s my primary goal right now." After revealing the answer, Amitabh Bachchan was all praise for Kangana and said, “Kangana Ranaut ji is a very beautiful, number one and famous artist. She has won many awards including National Awards and Filmfare Awards."<a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/kaun-banega-crorepati-11-amitabh-bachchan-reveals-he-pulled-off-an-18-hour-shift-days-after-doctors-warning-to-cut-off-work/5dcbed3a87fb571eff7e3d02"> ALSO READ: Kaun Banega Crorepati 11: Amitabh Bachchan Reveals He Pulled Off An 18-Hour Shift, Days After Doctors’ Warning To Cut Off Work</a></p>
