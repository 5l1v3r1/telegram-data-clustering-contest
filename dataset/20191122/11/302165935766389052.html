      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 22 — Nepal plans to introduce Bahasa Melayu (BM) as an elective subject in its schools to equip students with communication skills in the professional setting in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>The matter, however, needs further discussion with Nepalese Cabinet and relevant authorities, said Nepalese Education, Science and Technology Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel when he held a bilateral meeting with Malaysia’s Education Minister Maszlee Malik recently.</p>
      <p>Giriraj also welcomed Maszlee’s proposal to set up a Malaysian language institution in the South Asian nation to teach BM to Nepalese.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Bernama when met on the sidelines of the World Innovative Summit For Education 2019, held between November 19 to 21 in Doha, Qatar, Maszlee said:</p>
      <p>“There are approximately 357,000 Nepali currently working in Malaysia, primarily in the security, manufacturing and hospitality sectors.</p>
      <p>“Teaching BM and setting up institutions would be useful when Nepalese seek employment in Malaysia as they would be able to communicate fluently and boost their career.”</p>
      <p>Maszlee said both leaders also discussed on enhancing and improving Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) studies in Nepal.</p>
      <p>“Nepalese minister was impressed with our German Dual Training System for TVET and for them, it would be useful.</p>
      <p>“This is because Nepal wants to produce skilful Nepalese workers to work abroad with better pay and a TVET certification,” he said.</p>
      <p>Maszlee said Nepal was also looking for opportunities to send their students to pursue post-graduate studies in Malaysia, and to collaborate with Malaysian universities.</p>
      <p>Giriraj also extended an invitation to Maszlee to visit Nepal in conjunction with the Visit Nepal 2020, and to attend the Artificial Intelligence Conference in Kathmandu next year. — Bernama</p>
