      <h3>Space Engineers Achievements Now Have Nice Round Numbers – But They're Still a Bit Off</h3>

      <p>Back in September, the community was initially pleased to see that the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n38908/space-engineers-achievement-list-revealed">Space Engineers achievement list had been revealed</a> – given that the game first appeared on our radars five years ago in an ID@Xbox round-up, it was exciting to start ancipating the space management sim's launch. However the picture quickly went sour with our user base who particularly like to keep their gamerscore rounded out – the list was full of unlocks for an unattractive 37 gamerscore. Happily, Keen Software House have quietly recitfied the issue, sorting the achievement into tidier rounded parcels while also announcing the game's first Xbox One live stream – where we anticipate that we will find out that long-awaited release date.</p>
      <p>Here's the updated <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Space-Engineers/achievements">Space Engineers achievement list</a>, with all of those 37s replaced with more palatable 35s, 40s, 60s and 70s. Alright, it's still not as rounded as it could be, but it'll do.</p>

      <p>The achievement list is still a little screwy – it appears that the developers were intending to have the achievement descriptions change dependent on whether the achievement was locked or unlocked, perhaps to hide the requirements. However according to our scanned the achievement descriptions are identical whether locked or unlocked, except for the phrase (Locked) in front of each one. We also had a couple of the achievements scan in a little wonky, as though a couple were going to be a title update rather than part of the base game. We suspect all of these problems are down to the fact that, for whatever reason, a rare few achievement lists enter the Xbox systems very early – possibly before they're properly tested and verified. The game info team's best guess is that a tester may have started unlocking live achievements before some internal sign-off or embargo, resulting in a list turning up far too early and unfinished. Fingers crossed the remaining weirdness will be sorted by the time the game actually releases.</p>
      <p>We'll find out a lot more about Space Engineers soon, including hopefully its release date, during the game's first live stream on Xbox One. The developers hinted that the release date would be included in the show in the comments of their tweet about the stream:</p>

      <p>As we wait for more news, and maybe some further tweaks to the list, we can at least take solace in the fact that there's no more 37s.<br/><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/tags/Upcoming-Release">Upcoming Release</a><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-one/news">Xbox One</a><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/id-at-xbox">ID@Xbox<br/></a><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39805/space-engineers-achievements-odd-gamerscore#oMessages">View comments <br/></a><pic src="https://static.trueachievements.com/imagestore/0003476400/3476448.jpg" width="64" height="64"/><br/>Written by <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sam+Quirke">Sam Quirke<br/></a>Sam has been a Newshound since 2016 and is now the Editor for both TrueAchievements and TrueTrophies.
