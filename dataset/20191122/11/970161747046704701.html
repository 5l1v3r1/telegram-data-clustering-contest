      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jon-voight/">Jon Voight</a> is one of the few big names in Hollywood to have voiced support for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>’s presidency – and now the President has repaid the favour.</p>
      <p>The Mission: Impossible and Pearl Harbor actor was invited to The White House yesterday (21 November) to be presented with the prestigious National Medal of Arts and Humanities in a ceremony which took place against <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/top-donald-trump-ally-says-there-is-a-quid-pro-qro-proving-president-abused-office-11189547/">the backdrop of the impeachment hearings happening across town.</a></p>
      <p>Trump praised Voight’s Oscar and award nominations during a speech which briefly – and rather unexpectedly, judging by POTUS’ initially confused reaction – saw the theme from Midnight Cowboy being played.</p>

      <p>Voight, presumably swept up by all the excitement, proceeded to get up from his chair and awkwardly shimmy, throw shapes and grandad-dance in front of the President, the guests and the press.</p>

      <p>Sick moves, Jon.</p>
      <p>Trump appeared to approve of the impromptu dancing, chuckling away as Voight shimmered towards him before shaking his fist in approval (we guess?) and pointing at the veteran actor.</p>
      <p>‘I wanted to hear that whole song,’ Trump told the audience after that strange interlude. ‘But I dunno, Jon, maybe we gotta keep things moving a little bit?’</p>
      <p>Which presumably was Presidential Code for ‘please don’t dance again’.</p>

      <p>‘Jon captures the imagination of audiences and dominates almost every single scene,’ Trump later said in gushing praise. ‘He’s a special person.</p>
      <p>‘Jon Voight, you are an amazing artist and a beloved icon of American film.</p>
      <p>‘We love having you here: especially as you’re someone I really like.’</p>

      <p>Things later returned to Level Awkward, though, when Trump presented Voight with his medal, as Trump managed to ignore Voight’s outstretched hand when the actor went in for a handshake.</p>
      <p>Just another day in the Trump White House, we guess.</p>
