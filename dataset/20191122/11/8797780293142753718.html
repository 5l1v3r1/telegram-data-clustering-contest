      <p>I still haven’t played Borderlands 3. It’s sitting there, installed, ready to go my PlayStation 4 Pro, but I haven’t so much as looked at the icon in weeks. I refuse to play it, mostly because it’s a game series that I play co-op with my wife. We could split-screen the thing, but I’m waiting on that promised cross-platform play that’ll let me play on PC while she plays on PS4. I also very much doubt this functionality will ever come, so it’s possible that I may just never play Borderlands 3.</p>
      <p>Don’t be like me, because it’s apparently a heck of a lot of fun. While it doesn’t really do very much new, <a href="https://www.criticalhit.net/review/borderlands-3/">it’s still a whole lotta zany lootin-and-shootin.</a></p>
      <blockquote>“Borderlands 3 may be a braindead story of already dead on arrival memes and a cast that is largely forgettable (Save for Tannis, I still love you for being my socially inept spirit animal), but it’s easily the most satisfying power fantasy of the year thanks to its amazingly tuned gunplay and a sophisticated flow of action that picks up the juvenile slack.”</blockquote>
      <p>Anyway, to help you <i>not be like me</i>, Borderlands 3 is free to play this whole weekend. If you’ve got nothing to do and a whole lot of bandwidth to spare (about 40GB), you can grab the game on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1001-CUSA07823_00-000000000OAKSIEA">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/borderlands-3/c34nb0f1b5wq?ocid=xboxcompdp&amp;locale=en-US&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Xbox One</a>. Sorry PC gamers, but there’s no free weekend for you – probably because that sort of functionality isn’t built into Epic’s Launcher. On consoles, you will need Xbox Live Gold or PlayStation Plus if you plan to join your friends online</p>
