      <p>Not for the first time in the past couple of months, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/marilyn-manson/">Marilyn Manson</a> has unveiled a new cover song – a brilliant take on The Doors’ 1967 classic The End.</p>
      <p>The rendition follows The God Of Fuck’s <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/watch-marilyn-mansons-disturbing-new-video-gods-gonna-cut-you-down/">cover of American folk song God’s Gonna Cut You Down</a>, and comes with an accompanying music video based on one of his own original watercolour paintings.</p>

      <p>Fans who attending Manson’s tour with <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/rob-zombie/">Rob Zombie</a> in the U.S. over the summer will have already heard The End being played over the PA, but now it’s not only available to hear in all its glory – it’ll also be available as a limited-edition picture disc from March 6 next year. Pre-order that right <a href="https://found.ee/MM_TheEnd12Inch">here</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/marilyn-manson-on-his-new-album-i-wouldnt-compare-it-to-any-of-my-other-records/">Earlier in the year</a>, Mazza spoke of his work on the follow-up to 2017 studio album Heaven Upside Down, as that record’s arrival date (hopefully) edges ever-closer.</p>
      <p>“I’m in a mode in life where I wanted to tell stories with this record, and it’s sort of like a wax museum of my thoughts, a study of the chamber of horrors in my head,” he said. “All the romance and hope you can have in the world, here in the End Times where it can be a different kind of apocalypse for each person listening to the record.</p>
      <p>“I tried to paint it with words, and Shooter [Jennings] with sounds, so you can see and hear all of your longing, your passion and despair.</p>
      <p>“That’s sort of a dramatic explanation of it! But it is full of drama. I wouldn’t compare it to any of my other records, but you hear a bit of everything. It’s like I’ve focused everything into one spot, finally.”</p>
