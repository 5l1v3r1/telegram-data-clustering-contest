      <p><b>WARSAW, PolandÂ (AP)</b> - Poland's parliament has elected three new judges to the constitutional court who were nominated by the conservative ruling party, including two who have drawn sharp criticism from the opposition.</p>
      <p>The appointees to the Constitutional Tribunal approved late Thursday are raising more concerns about Poland's judiciary. The president must still approve them.</p>
      <p>The most controversial is Stanislaw Piotrowicz, a former communist-era state prosecutor and architect of laws pushed by the ruling Law and Justice party that the European Union says erode judicial independence.</p>
      <p>The other is Krystyna Pawlowicz, a jurist and former lawmaker known whose radical rhetoric had at one point prompted the ruling Law and Justice party to say she would leave politics.</p>
      <p>Piotrowicz lost his seat in parliament in October elections.</p>
