      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:27:43+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:27</time> by <a rel="author">Ciaran Kelly</a></address>
      <p>Steve Bruce is delighted 'good-looking b******'' <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> is back in football and joked he has five months to prepare a game plan to prolong the Spurs boss' <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/st-james-park">St James' Park</a> hoodoo.</p>
      <p>The pair first came up against each other back in 2004 when <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Bruce</a> was in charge of Birmingham City and Mourinho was at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and have remained friendly ever since.</p>
      <p>That relationship proved crucial to Mourinho allowing goalkeeper Sam Johnstone to join Aston Villa on loan during his time at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , for example.</p>
      <p>While Bruce is certainly looking forward to meeting Mourinho on the touchline again, the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> head coach has been keen to pay tribute to Mourinho's predecessor, Mauricio Pochettino, too.</p>
      <p>"I was like everybody else when he got the job at Chelsea, proclaiming himself as the Special One and he wasn't wrong," he told ChronicleLive.</p>
      <p>"He had gold dust, he had that sparkle, something different and, of course, being such a good-looking b****** as well, he had the lot!</p>
      <p>"I'm delighted he's back. He's helped me enormously over the years. I keep in touch with him. The game needs people like Jose and it will be interesting to see now what he does at Spurs. It's good to see him back.</p>
      <p>"The other one, Pochettino, I have huge, huge respect for him as well. What a job he's done at Tottenham over the last few years.</p>
      <p>"That somebody who got to a Champions League final in May is unemployed today is incredible but that's the industry we live in. This mad, mad world of football that we all can't do without."</p>
      <p>Mourinho has never won a league game at St James' Park and this will be his fourth stint in the Premier League where he will look to finally break that curse.</p>
      <p>While Mourinho has managed more away league games at Newcastle without winning than at any other club in his career,the Portuguese likes coming to the North East.</p>
      <p>Not only does Mourinho have a deep-rooted respect for the Geordies, and the club's heritage, but <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcaslte-tottenham-jose-mourinho-record-16221403">visiting St James' Park helps him to reconnect with mentor Sir Bobby Robson</a> .</p>
      <p>Graeme Souness, Glenn Roeder, Alan Pardew, Steve McClaren and Rafa Benitez have all taken points off Mourinho and Bruce will hope to follow in their footsteps on May 2.</p>
      <p>"I've heard that. Jesus, I've got something to live up to here!" he added. "So I've got five months to prepare for that one."</p>
