      <p>Washington state has dealt a setback to efforts to build one of the world’s biggest methanol plants on the Columbia River.</p>
      <p>In a decision Friday, the Department of Ecology said backers of the $2 billion project still had not provided enough information about greenhouse gas emissions and how they would be offset. It is requiring another round of environmental review.</p>
      <p>The Northwest Innovation Works project would take natural gas from Canada and convert it into methanol, which would be shipped to China to make olefins — compounds used in everything from fabrics and contact lenses to iPhones and medical equipment.</p>
      <p>Backers said the project would seriously reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by displacing China’s use of coal to make methanol. Environmental groups said there was little evidence of that.</p>
