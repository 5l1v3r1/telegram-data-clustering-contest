      <p>Market benchmark Sensex dropped 216 points on Friday, dragged by losses in index-heavyweights Infosys, TCS and HDFC Bank.</p>
      <p>After trading on a weak note through the day, the 30-share index ended 215.76 points, or 0.53%, lower at 40,359.41. It hit an intra-day low of 40,276.83 and a high of 40,653.17.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty settled 54 points, or 0.45%, down at 11,914.40.</p>
      <p>Infosys was the top loser in the Sensex pack, dropping 2.89%, followed by TCS, Asian Paints, Bharti Airtel and HCL Tech.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Tata Steel gained 3.74%, NTPC 2.35%, Vedanta 2.27% and ONGC 2.18%.</p>
      <p>IT stocks led the fall in the market amid reports of changes in US work visa requirements aimed at protecting American workers, traders said.</p>

      <p>European equities were also trading on a positive note in their respective early deals.</p>
