      <p>The incident took place at an empty flat in Alma Place, Crieff at around 10pm on November 18.</p>
      <p>The two men were disturbed in the process of carrying out their act by residents of a neighbouring property.</p>
      <p>They subsequently made off but did not manage to take all of the metal with them.</p>
      <p>However, the flooding caused by the removal of the tanks was described by police as “extensive”.</p>
      <p>A Police Scotland statement said: “Officers would like to trace the two men who were disturbed committing the theft.</p>
      <p>“The first is described as about 5ft 11 with an untidy ginger beard, wearing a dark tammy and a dark jacket.</p>
      <p>“The second is described as also about 5ft 11 with a thin face, wearing a light baseball cap, light coloured windbreaker-style jacket and blue jeans.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information should contact police on 101 citing reference number CR/31145/19.</p>
      <p>Information can be passed on anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
