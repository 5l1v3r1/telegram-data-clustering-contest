      <p>Pakistan teenage bowler Naseem Shah has the potential to become a ‘superstar’, according to former England captain <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michael-vaughan/">Michael Vaughan</a>.</p>
      <p>Naseem, 16, made his international debut in the opening Test against Australia in Brisbane this week.</p>
      <p>The seamer has only played seven first-class matches and is yet to take a wicket against Australia as David Warner’s unbeaten 151 saw the hosts dominate Pakistan in Brisbane.</p>

      <p>Tim Paine’s Australia bowled Pakistan out for 214 at the Gabba and the home side had reached 312-1 by the close of play on day two.</p>
      <p>Despite his unenviable welcome to Test cricket, Pakistan’s new bowling sensation Naseem has been backed to develop into a ‘superstar’ by England hero Vaughan and Australia opener Warner.</p>
      <p>Vaughan tweeted: ‘1 over into his Test Career… but already you can see Naseem Shah is going to be a superstar! 16 yrs old and clocking 147kph with a fantastic action.’</p>

      <p>Naseem had Warner caught behind on day two but the dismissal was overturned due to a no-ball.</p>
      <p>Naseem is yet to bowl at record-breaking Ashes star Steve Smith, who is widely considered the best batsman in the world.</p>
      <p>On the prospect of facing Naseem, Smith said ahead of the series: ‘He’s half my age. It’ll be interesting.’</p>

      <p>Warner, meanwhile, likened Naseem to a young Mohammad Amir after facing the Pakistani for the first time.</p>
      <p>‘He charged in, and there’s a superstar there,’ Australia’s centurion said. ‘Like when Mohammad Amir came on the scene, the first time, he was rapid and had us all in a pickle.</p>
      <p>‘Naseem is quite skiddy, got a nice fluent action, and he won’t get a harder Test debut than out there and bowl at the Gabba,’</p>
