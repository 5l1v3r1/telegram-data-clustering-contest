      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino told to pick Arsenal job over Man Utd</h1>
      <h2>The Argentinean left Tottenham after five-and-a-half years at the club earlier this week, and has been urged to make the short move to their north London rivals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:08:12+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:08</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino would be much better suited to the Arsenal manager's job than Manchester United's, according to former Scotland forward Ally McCoist.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> sacked Pochettino earlier this week and replaced him with Jose Mourinho, appointing the ex-Chelsea and Man Utd manager on a three-and-a-half year deal to the surprise of many.</p>
      <p>Even when he was in his position at Tottenham, Pochettino has long been linked with replacing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in the Old Trafford hotseat.</p>
      <p>But with pressure mounting on Gunners boss Unai Emery ahead of this weekend's meeting with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> , McCoist thinks the former Saints boss could do a better job with Spurs' hated rivals, even if the switch would be deeply unpopular with fans.</p>

      <p>When pressed if Arsenal would be the better move for him on Sky Sports' <i>The Debate</i> , McCoist - who played for and managed Rangers - said: "Yeah, I think so.</p>
      <p>"I definitely think [a young team is better for him]. If you’re asking me, I think he’d suit <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> ’s squad more than he’d suit <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> ’s squad.</p>
      <p>"There are a group of players at Arsenal he could work with immediately.</p>

      <p>"Manchester United is a far bigger job, by that I mean longer term, more of a rebuild.</p>
      <p>"I think there are, at this moment in time, probably more players to work with at Arsenal. Manchester United fans might not agree with that.</p>
      <p>"I do think Emery is vulnerable. I think he’s probably the most vulnerable."</p>

      <p>Pochettino has also been linked with moves to Bayern Munich and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> , although many are expecting him to take a break from the game following his axe from Spurs.</p>
      <p>Mourinho will take charge of his first Spurs game in a London derby at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Saturday lunchtime.</p>
