      <h1>Seven parishioners bear responsibility for keeping 1,000-year-old village church alive</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:25:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/gabriella-swerling/" target="_blank">Gabriella Swerling</a></address>
      <p>Seven parishioners are bearing the responsibility for keeping an almost 1,000-year-old village church open by raising donations out of their own pockets.</p>
      <p>The latest Church of England data shows that church attendances have fallen steadily across Britain over the last decade,<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/17/church-englands-prayer-apps-used-record-five-million-times-attendance/"> to just 1.18million regular churchgoers last year</a>.</p>
      <p>Such a decline puts churches representing small communities, such as All Saints' Church, in Graveney, Kent - which has a population of 490 - at risk of closure. </p>
      <p>The 900-year-old Grade-I listed village church is facing having its doors shut closed for good because it has just seven regular parishioners. </p>
      <p>The Vicar Jean Burrows says this is a concerning trend reflected in rural parishes across the country.</p>
      <p>Parishioners say that unless the number of regular churchgoers increases, or a new funding source opens up, the centuries-old church will have to close.</p>
      <p>It hosts weddings, funerals, baptisms, christenings and all sorts of non-Christian events - such as helping rough sleepers and raising money for charity.</p>
      <p>However, just to keep the building open and pay the vicar, parishioners are having to fork out £40 a week.</p>
      <p>Janet Turner, 75, Parochial Church Council secretary, said that if this carries on, the church could  be forced to close in less than two years.</p>
      <p>"This is a building that has been part of the life of the village for 900 years,” she said. “What happens if you let it go - people may regret it."</p>
      <p>She explained that regular attendees at All Saints' Church had dropped to around seven in recent years.</p>
      <p>"Families tend not come to church on Sundays any more, they do other things," she said.</p>
      <p>"But sadly many very beautiful, historic buildings, which have served communities for hundreds of years are in danger of closing.</p>
      <p>"Our church is not only there for worship, but we also raise funds for charity and give people a place to come and talk if they need to.</p>
      <p>"We are trying to innovate and make it place for everyone - worshipers and non-worshipers. We want to stay alive, and it would be nice to have more people come and join us."</p>
      <p>The church was built in the 12th century, but a prayer building had existed on the site since the early 800s. The box pews are also Grade I listed.</p>
      <p>Ms Turner says the light which filters through the stained glass windows from the marshes gives the inside of the church a beautiful hue.</p>
      <p>Vicar Jean, who covers three churches, said: "They are a small congregation, but they are very committed to keeping the church open.</p>
      <p>"We have lots of fundraising events for the building and fundraising events for the congregation."</p>
      <p>She added that the risk of village churches closing was an issue across the whole country.</p>
      <p>"There are hundreds of churches like ours," the vicar explained. It is concerning because the church is part of the village.</p>
      <p>"People come for baptisms, weddings and funerals - it's always there.But the time will come when it may not be there, if the locals don't support it."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Diocese of Canterbury said, “All Saints’ is a beautiful church with a small, but committed, congregation and there are no current plans to close it. </p>
      <p>"However, it is clear that many churches across the country are facing the challenge of sustainability, especially those with older buildings or smaller congregations. </p>
      <p>"We continue to work with our churches to rise to this challenge, seeking creative ways to reimagine worship, to make the best use of our buildings and to serve our communities.”  </p>
