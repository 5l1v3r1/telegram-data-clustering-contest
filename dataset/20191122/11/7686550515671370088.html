      <h2>Losing sleep can impact your physical health and also damage your relationship</h2>

      <p>Sleeping next to a snorer can be frustrating.</p>
      <p>It's likely that you've spent countless nights unable to sleep as your partner snores away next to you.</p>
      <p>However, researchers suggest that losing sleep from snorers is more than just an inconvenience, it can also have negative repercussions on your physical and mental well-being, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/sleeping-next-someone-who-snores-20931824">Mirror Online</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Having a disrupted sleep pattern increases your risk of developing anxiety and depression and the negatives don't end there, it also increases your chance of developing obesity or suffering a stroke.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://brightside.me/inspiration-health/according-to-a-study-sleeping-with-a-snorer-can-take-a-toll-on-your-health-794848/">Bright Side</a> , your body is less able to recover and fulfil basic biological functions after a rough night's sleep; your metabolism is less efficient and you might find it harder to consolidate memories.</p>
      <p>It can also greatly impact your day ahead as you find yourself less productive and unable to perform seemingly basic tasks.</p>
      <p>Snorers themselves can't escape the negative repercussions; constantly being woken up and told to stop snoring can impact their sleep pattern and it can also cause friction in a relationship.</p>
      <p>Queens University in Canada carried out a study to discover how snoring impacts our hearing.</p>
      <p>The study consisted of four couples, where one person in the relationship had severe sleep apnea.</p>
      <p>The loud noise didn't impact the snorers but all four partners suffered hearing damage equivalent to sleeping next to an industrial machine, particularly in the ear that was closest to the snoring partner.</p>
      <p>A study from Imperial College of Science in London also found that loud noises can lead to high blood pressure, which could lead to kidney problems, dementia and heart disease.</p>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/snoring/">NHS</a> , there are certain things you can do to stop snoring, including losing weight if you're overweight and sleeping on your side instead of your back. <br/><br/>However, if these lifestyle changes don't work there are other treatments to try.</p>
      <p><b>Mandibular advancement device</b><br/>This is a device you wear in your mouth to prevent your tongue from blocking the back of your throat. <br/><br/><b>Vestibular Shield</b><br/>A chin strap used to hold your mouth closed so you breathe through your nose when sleeping.</p>
      <p><b>Nasal Dilators</b><br/>Nose strips that hold your nasal airways open while you sleep. They are are also available in spray form.</p>
      <p>If nothing else works, surgery can also be used to correct snoring. However, there's no guarantee that this will stop snoring permanently.</p>
