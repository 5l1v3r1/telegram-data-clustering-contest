      <p>When diet and exercise isn’t enough, people often think outside of the box to promote weight loss and body health. Even now, scientists from <a href="https://researchnews.ntu.edu.sg/2018/05/01/obesity-a-patch-a-day-keeps-belly-fat-away/">Singapore</a> have claimed to have created a new device to help people safely lose weight and it works by directly targeting body fat.</p>
      <p>We at <b>Bright Side</b> love to share new innovations in healthcare and so we’re sharing this story with you, which could help the many people fighting with obesity worldwide.</p>

      <p>The new patch, which is said to be as easy to apply as a Band-Aid and <b>can help promote weight loss without exercise</b>, was invented by <a href="http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=chenpeng">Professor Chen Peng</a> and <a href="http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=CJXU">Assistant Professor Xu Chenjie</a> of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore’s School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering.</p>
      <p>A problem with many weight-loss products is that they target water weight and not pure body fat, which is also easily replenished.<b> This patch</b>, however, allegedly <b>targets body fat directly</b>. Using microneedles, the device is said to insert drugs into the body that will help convert white fat cells, which the body stores, to brown fat cells, which the body burns to produce heat. In the past, people have also use cryotherapy or freezing, to achieve a similar effect.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>So far, <b>the patch has been tested on mice and it had good results</b>. Not only did the application promote the conversion of white fat to brown, but the obese mice were also found to have stopped gaining weight and body fat.</p>

      <p>At this time, while there are various medical treatments aimed at reducing body fat in obese patients, most of them are given orally or through injection, often in large doses and with serious side effects. According to Chen, not only would it be easier to use, but the patch even uses fewer ingredients than other similar treatments, which <b>reduces both the cost of producing it and the possible side effects patients will face</b>.</p>

      <p>Obesity impacts people of all different walks of life and can come with serious consequences like diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In the United States, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3198075/">studies</a> claim that many people who suffer from obesity, or are simply overweight, could blame their problem on poverty, since they might have limited access to fresh, healthy food. Similarly, there also appears to be a link between poverty and sedentariness. Added to that, many people also suffer from genetic issues that could impact their body weight.</p>
