      <h1>Key Trump Impeachment Witness Calls Right-wing Soros Attacks the ‘New Protocols of the Elders of Zion’</h1>
      <h2>Fiona Hill, a former White House senior staffer, dropped several bombshells in her impeachment hearing testimony</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:26:02+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:26</time> by <a rel="author">JTA and Ron Kampeas</a></address>
      <p>Fiona Hill, a former White House senior staffer providing key testimony in congressional hearings to impeach President Donald Trump, likened a right-wing narrative casting liberal Jewish billionaire George Soros as all-controlling to a notorious anti-Semitic forgery.</p>
      <p>The narrative that Soros is behind an array of evildoings “is the new Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” Hill said Thursday in hearings. “It’s an absolute outrage.”</p>
      <p>Soros has become a bugbear for some right-wingers, who blame his liberal philanthropy for a number of ills, citing little evidence. Trump himself last year blamed Soros for an “invasion” of Central American migrants that never materialized.</p>
      <p>Hill in closed testimony last month had described the attacks as “anti-Semitic” and needing repudiation by Republicans. Her evident frustration and horror at the specious Soros-related attacks on her and colleagues, including the former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, was one of many dramatic moments in the hearings, which wrapped up Thursday.</p>
      <p>Hill explained the background to the “Protocols,” a czarist forgery from the late 19th century casting Jews as all-controlling and evil that has been cited multiple times by anti-Semites.</p>
      <p>“This is the longest-running anti-Semitic trope that we have in history,” she said.</p>
      <p>Hill, who until August was Trump’s senior director for European and Russian affairs, testified in an impeachment query aimed at ascertaining whether Trump solicited a bribe from Ukraine when he asked that government to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, while he withheld defense assistance from the country for a period.</p>
