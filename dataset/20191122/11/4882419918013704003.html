      <p>PSG coach Thomas Tuchel is starting to get fed up of Neymar and that was shown when he was asked about the Brazilian's recent trip to Madrid to watch the Davis Cup, organised by ex Barca team-mate Gerard Pique.</p>
      <p>The German coach responded: "What can I do? I'm not his father, I'm not the police, I'm his caoch. It's clear that as his coach I did not like this trip at all."</p>
      <p>However he said: "It's not the moment to lose your head. Neymar has been very professional in the last two weeks, in which he's worked more than others. He took part in the group sessions and did individual work too."</p>
      <p>He said Ney will reappear after injury against Lille. "He will play, but not 90 minutes. We're yet to decide if he starts or comes on during the game."</p>
