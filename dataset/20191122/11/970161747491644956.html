      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/robbie-williams/">Robbie Williams</a> has revealed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/britney-spears/">Britney Spears</a> turned down his request to duet on Fairytale Of New York.</p>
      <p>That’s her prerogative.</p>
      <p>The Take That star, who’s gunning for Christmas number one with his new album The Christmas Present, revealed that Britney’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/08/britney-spears-music-break-last-10-years-uses-life-transition-focus-mental-health-10881747/">taking no prisoners with her break from music</a>.</p>
      <p>Explaining that his favourite festive tune is The Pogues’ hit, Robbie told Heart’s Jamie Theakston and Amanda Holden: ‘But listen, check this out, I asked Britney Spears to duet with me on Fairytale of New York.</p>
      <p>‘She said no. What a lovely story.’</p>
      <p>Ouch.</p>
      <p>‘What did you do? Did you ring her or did she just not text you back, how did that work?’ Jamie asked.</p>

      <p>Robbie explained: ‘She’s not working right now. She’s having a rest. Maybe it’ll happen in the future.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, things got a little awkward when Amanda offered herself up, with Robbie swiftly telling her: ‘We’re good Amanda.’</p>

      <p>Don’t worry Amanda, you can be on our Christmas album.</p>
      <p>However, it doesn’t seem like Robbie’s suffering too much from his lack of Britney, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/robbie-williams-coldplay-clashing-christmas-number-one-gripped-11186754/">as he’s currently clashing with Coldplay over who will take home the coveted Christmas number one</a>.</p>
      <p>After all, he did warn that<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/20/robbie-williams-wants-put-stop-michael-buble-owning-christmas-must-end-now-10950583/"> he’s coming for Michael Buble’s Christmas throne.</a></p>

      <p>With Chris Martin and co<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/24/coldplay-surprise-welsh-locals-revealing-everyday-life-album-tracklist-newspaper-listing-10973662/"> dropping their new album Everyday Life on the same day</a> as Robbie’s record, the stakes are high.</p>
      <p>A source <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10380679/robbie-williams-coldplay-war-christmas-no1/">told The Sun</a>: ‘Coldplay and Robbie are both massive forces when it comes to selling albums so the numbers they will shift next week will be huge.</p>
      <p>‘They have strong track records and very dedicated fan bases who will fight for their act to get to number one.’</p>
      <p>They added: ‘At the moment Coldplay are looking likely to pip him to the post, but with a week and a half to go it’s anyone’s game, especially given all of the publicity Robbie has done.’</p>
