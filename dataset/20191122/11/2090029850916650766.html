      <p>Nigerians have taken to social media to move against the Social Media bill being passed by the Nigerian senate.</p>
      <p>This outcry by Nigerians comes after the Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulations Bill also known as the Social Media Bill has passed second reading in the Senate on Wednesday, with support by majority of Senators.</p>

      <p>Most Nigerians are of the opinion that the bill is set to fight free speech. The bill was introduced to the Senate on Tuesday, November 5, 2019 and sponsored by Mohammed Sani Musa, a member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) representing Niger East Senatorial District.</p>
      <p>According to the senate, the bill is set to regulate the use of social media in Nigeria and curb fake news on the internet. If passed into law, the bill seeks to prevent falsehoods and manipulations and counter the effects of such communications and transmission to sanction offenders with a view of encouraging and enhancing transparency by social media platforms using the internet correspondences.</p>
      <p>When a similar anti-social media bill introduced by the previous eighth Senate, it also sparked outrage across the country, before it was later withdrawn.</p>
      <p>See some reactions from Nigerians below.</p>
      <blockquote>Raise up and #SayNoToSocialMediaBill Nigeria!!! They want to take away our voice. Our Legislators have failed us once more. ❌❌ – @gimbiyabintu1<br/><br/>If spreading false news will send u to jail, what about making and spreading false promises during election campaigns. We need to wake up in this country – @Blacc_recipe<br/><br/>Can we also have a bill for death penalty for corrupt politicians? #SayNoToSocialMediaBill – @mightyy_Obi<br/><br/>Have you heard about the time Sudan was being bombed up by their own people and couldn’t get the message access because of lack of internet? This could happen to us too and this isn’t a time to keep quiet – @ZaraH_AhmeD_</blockquote>
