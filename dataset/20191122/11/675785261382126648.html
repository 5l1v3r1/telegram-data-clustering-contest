      <h1>Taylor Swift music row - Scooter Braun accuses star of causing death threats from fans</h1>
      <h2>The Getaway Car hitmaker waged war on Scooter and Scott Borchetta for allegedly blocking her from performing her own songs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:36:52+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:36</time> by <a rel="author">Lily Waddell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lily-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>Taylor Swift has been accused of encouraging death threats aimed at Scooter Braun's family as their row rages on.</p>
      <p>Scooter Braun has broken his silence with a lengthy public <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> post addressed to the pop star herself.</p>
      <p>The Getaway Car hitmaker waged war on Scooter and Scott Borchetta for allegedly blocking her from performing her own songs on TV during the 2019 American Music Awards.</p>
      <p>A statement from Big Machine Label Group and Dick Clark Productions later said Taylor can perform her own songs and doesn't need their approval for live performances.</p>
      <p>Following this development in the saga, Taylor's former record label manager has taken to Instagram to share his own public message for the pop diva.</p>
      <p>The dad shared his concerns over death threats his family have received following his row with the Red singer.</p>

      <p>In the lengthy post, he wrote: "Since your public statement last week there have been numerous death threats directed at my family. This morning I spoke out publicly for the first time saying I wouldn't participate in a social media war.</p>
      <p>"However, I came home tonight to find my wife had received a phone call threatening the safety of our children as well as threats seen above. I won't go into the details of this past week.</p>
      <p>"I have been at a loss. Thinking of my wife and children, my team and their families, I have gone through a range of emotions on how to deal with this.</p>
      <p>"I write this now only after a deep breathe and much reflection. I am certain there is no situation ever worth jeopardizing anyone's safety."</p>

      <p>Although he said she had sparked the death threats inflicted upon his family, Scooter made clear he did not assume she had intended to do this.</p>
      <p>The musician boss noted Taylor's popularity means her words "carry a tremendous amount of weight".</p>
      <p>Upon reflection, the record executive said the times he crossed paths with Taylor they were "pleasant and respectful".</p>
      <p>Scooter claimed any open discussions he had tried to have with the singer in the past six months had been rejected.</p>
      <p>He pleaded with the fiery personality to come to a resolution after their fight and he vowed to make himself available to her jam-packed schedule.</p>

      <p>However, Scooter played Taylor an underhand jibe when he toyed with the idea the row was another "narrative" for the singer.</p>
      <p>The businessman was referring to the singer's much-talked about spats which have served as inspiration for her songs about revenge, break ups and feuds.</p>
      <p>He added: "Many have told me that a meeting will never happen as this is not about truth or resolution but instead a narrative for you. I am hopeful this is not the case."</p>
      <p>Scooter made clear in his statement he "respectfully disagreed" with many of her statements.</p>
      <p>But he did recognise it was important no performer should ever "feel cornered or bullied" in any way.</p>
      <p>The Mirror has approached Taylor Swift's representatives for further comment.</p>
