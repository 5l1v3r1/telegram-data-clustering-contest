      <p>Ratings boards can occasionally preempt exciting news. It's not terribly uncommon for a previously unannounced game to be rated ahead of the official reveal, or the announcement of a release date. Forgive us, then, for this latest development on one of PlayStation 4's most exciting exclusives, <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/dreams">Dreams</a>. It's been available in early access for the better half of this year, but a new rating might suggest we're getting a release date for the full launch soon.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/dreams-11">The Australian ratings board has afforded the Media Molecule project a PG</a>, but more interestingly, the rating was posted just a couple of days ago on 20th November. Is this a clue that Sony may finally be ready to announce a release date for the finalised version of Dreams?</p>
      <p>It's worth remembering that <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/11/rumour_did_the_release_date_for_dreams_just_get_leaked_by_shopto">online retailer ShopTo tweeted out about a supposed release date for the game</a> before hastily deleting it. That tweet suggested Dreams will launch on 14th February 2020, but it's unclear if this is the real deal or simply a mistake. Still, with these two hints arriving within about a week of each other, perhaps there's something to it.</p>
      <p>Do you think Sony is about to announce a release date for Dreams on PS4? Will it be Valentine's Day 2020, or another date entirely? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.</p>
