        <li>Musk tweeted on Thursday that the $US39,000 truck was “influenced partly” by the white Lotus Espirit used in “The Spy Who Loved Me.”</li>
        <li>In the film, the Lotus Espirit transforms into a submarine, allowing Roger Moore’s Bond and his female companion, Anya Amasova, to escape from villains who are chasing them in a helicopter.</li>
        <li>Musk bought the car used in the film for £616,000 ($US997,000,) joking after that he was “disappointed to learn that it can’t actually transform.”</li>

      <p>Tesla’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-truck-pictures-info-details-price-2019-11">new Cybertruck</a> is inspired by a 1977 James Bond spy car that Elon Musk loved so much he bought it at auction in 2013.</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-truck-pictures-info-details-price-2019-11">unveiled in Los Angeles on Thursday night</a>, with Musk tweeting afterwards its design was “influenced partly” by the film “The Spy Who Loved Me.”</p>
      <p>Musk added a clip from the film in which Bond, played by Roger Moore, and Bond-girl Anya Amasova, played by Barbara Bach, escape pursuing villains in a Lotus Espirit, which transforms into a submarine when Bond drives it into the ocean.</p>

      <p>In October 2013, Musk was outed as the anonymous bidder who bought the Lotus Espirit at auction in London for £616,000 ($US997,000) the month before.</p>
      <p>“It was amazing as a little kid in South Africa to watch James Bond in The Spy Who Loved Me drive his Lotus Esprit off a pier, press a button and have it transform into a submarine underwater,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/18/tesla-elon-musk-james-bond-lotus-submarine-car">Musk said at the time.</a></p>

      <p>“I was disappointed to learn that it can’t actually transform. What I’m going to do is upgrade it with a Tesla electric powertrain and try to make it transform for real.”</p>

      <p>It is not known if Musk has actually made any alterations to the car.</p>
      <p>The lauch of Musk’s new Cybertruck went off the rails somewhat on Thursday night when <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/video-tesla-cybertruck-launch-blooper-armour-windows-smashed-oops-2019-11">its “armour glass” windows were easily smashed during a demonstration.</a></p>
      <p>The car’s blocky and angular design has resulted in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/elon-musk-tesla-cybertruck-roasted-twitter-2019-11">a slew of memes</a> posted to social media, with many comparing it to the bad graphics of early 2000s video games.</p>
