      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:12:48+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Market benchmark Sensex dropped 216 points on Friday, dragged by losses in index-heavyweights Infosys, TCS and HDFC Bank.</p>
      <p>After trading on a weak note through the day, the 30-share index ended 215.76 points, or 0.53 per cent, lower at 40,359.41. It hit an intra-day low of 40,276.83 and a high of 40,653.17.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty settled 54 points, or 0.45 per cent, down at 11,914.40.</p>
      <p>Infosys was the top loser in the Sensex pack, dropping 2.89 per cent, followed by TCS, Asian Paints, Bharti Airtel and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/hcl-technologies/">HCL</a> Tech.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Tata Steel gained 3.74 per cent, NTPC 2.35 per cent, Vedanta 2.27 per cent and ONGC 2.18 per cent.</p>
      <p>IT stocks led the fall in the market amid reports of changes in US work visa requirements aimed at protecting American workers, traders said.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul settled in the green, while Shanghai finished on a negative note.</p>
      <p>European equities were also trading on a positive note in their respective early deals.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Indian rupee depreciated marginally to 71.79 against the US dollar in intra-day trade.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, dipped 0.03 per cent to USD 63.95 per barrel.</p>
