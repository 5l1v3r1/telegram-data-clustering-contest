      <h1>Why Cong. Alfred continues to act</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:59:53+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/mario-bautista" target="_blank">Mario Bautista</a></address>
      <h3>ALFRED Vargas is busy now with his work as QC District 5 congressman but he still has not neglected his roots, which is acting. “Siyempre that’s where I started in 2001 nang makuha ako as part ng Star Circle,” he says. “Ka-batch ko sina Bea Alonzo, Dennis Trillo, TJ Trinidad at marami pang hindi na active ngayon. I’m thankful sa lahat ng nakasama ko sa showbiz, from the producers, directors, networks to my co-actors, kasi I wouldn’t be where I am now kundi sa mga pinagdaanan ko with them.”</h3>
      <p>He is the only who has successfully branched out into politics as current congressman of QC’s 5th district. He continues to act, though. He has finished two new movies and is also a guest in the new GMA-7 soap, “Magkaagaw”, playing a special role as the man who comes between Sunshine Dizon and Sheryl Cruz, and in iWant streaming’s movie, “Wild Little Love” with Carminal Villarroel.</p>
      <p>The two full length films he has finished for the big screen are “Kaputol” with Cherie Gil and Angel Aquino, and “Tagpuan” with Iza Calzado and Shaina Magdayao, both written by Ricardo Lee and directed by Mac Alejandre. “Kaputol” is a film within a film. Cherie plays a director and Alfred is her actor in a film where they play siblings.</p>
      <p>“Tagpuan” is a film a love story about OFW’s caught in a triangle. Iza is Alfred’s wife who works in New York, then he meets Shaina in Hongkong and they have an affair. All of them will all converge later in New York. Both films will be released in theatres by next year.</p>
      <p>And although he is busy with showbiz and politics, Alfred also found time to finish his master’s degree in public administration from UP. Later on, he wants to pursue a doctorate degree.</p>
      <p>“Enjoy ako going to class kasi my classmates are all professionals and public servants like me,” he says. “It widens my network and I learn a lot from them during our discussions in class. Getting post graduate degrees is a promise I made to my late mom. She’s a lawyer and she wanted me to take up law. When I joined showbiz, nagtampo siya sa akin. But natuwa siya when she saw me in the first ‘Pangako Sa’Yo’ and told me okay na ko mag-showbiz, but I should pursue graduate studies, which I’m doing now.”</p>
      <p>His mom Susana succumbed to the big C in 2014 and Alfred is proud that the bill he co-authored, House Bill No. 8636 or the National Integrated Cancer Control Act, was passed into law last February. It calls for the adoption of “an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development” which will strengthen cancer control policies, programs and services of our health care system through affordable and accessible treatment and prevent deaths from cancer.</p>
      <p>Even if he’s busy with showbiz, politics and his studies, Alfred remains first and foremost, a caring husband to his wife Yasmine and their three kids Alexandra Milan, Aryana Cassandra, and Alfredo Cristiano who will always be his first priority. “I’m first and foremost, a devoted family man,” he declares proudly. “Kahit gaano ako ka-busy with showbiz and public service, I always find time for them, lalo na going to church together.”</p>
