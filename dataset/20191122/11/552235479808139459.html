      <p>Police found a “smashed-up” living room and an injured man when they were called to a domestic dispute.</p>
      <p>Jennifer King, aged 32, of Loudon Terrace, Prestwick appeared at Ayr Sheriff Court on Tuesday, November 12.</p>
      <p>She admitted behaving in a threatening or abusive manner, likely to cause a reasonable person to suffer fear and alarm in that she did shout, swear and throw furniture and household items about, at her home in Loudon Terrace on September 15.</p>
      <p>King recklessly kicked a door, causing it to strike her partner, Alexander Gibson, in the face.</p>
      <p>Fiscal Depute, Scott Toal said Police attended after a phone call and upon arrival there was a lot of shouting with a child “upset and crying.”</p>
      <p>They went into the property and the accused began shouting at them, telling them to get out. The accused was arrested.</p>
      <p>Sheriff David Bicket deferred sentenced until May 12 and ordered King to be of good behaviour until her next court appearance.</p>
