        <b>Mahira Sharma’s mother Sania wants her daughter to steer cleer of any link-ups in the Bigg Boss 13 house. She is upset with Shehnaaz Gill for often linking up her daughter with Paras Chhabra</b>
      </p>
      <p>Every year in the Bigg Boss house, koi na koi love story banti hi hai! But this time, it's not exactly that way as we see Shehnaaz Gill who has feelings for Paras Chhabra often linking him up with Mahira Sharma in the house. But, we also see how Mahira says that her mother has warned her to not get into a relationship on the show.</p>
      <p>So as the girl maintains her stance in the house, we decided to know it from her mother Sania Sharma this time. She told us, "No, I haven't put any such condition. But my daughter herself is a very sensible girl. In fact, at times I feel she is more sensible than me. She is very focused to become a big star and when she has got a platform like Bigg Boss to prove herself, she will definitely not use anyone else and link herself up just to stay in news or in the cameras. We come from a family where we don’t like all these things and I am feeling proud that my daughter is following this.”</p>

      <p>Sania Sharma further added, "First thing, no one can fall in love with someone on TV. I know that she has turned close to Paras but it is just pure friendship which will last even after the show. So, I really hate it when Shehnaaz drags my daughter’s name between her and Paras and tries to create a love triangle which doesn’t even exist. She keeps saying all this just to get some more footage. If you all have seen, she herself said it on the show that no one is giving her work in the Punjabi film industry whereas my daughter has given so many Punjabi hits right from Lehenga, Gal Karke, Love You Oye. So, I think she is just using my daughter’s name to earn limelight.”</p>

      <p>Continuing in the same vein, she says, “Mujhe nahi pasand meri beti kisiko chipke yaa kisike saath soye. Woh log aur honge jinko apni beti ko National TV par yeh sab karta dekh proud feel hota hai.”<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- abpnews/instagram/parasvchhabra/colorstv</i></p>
