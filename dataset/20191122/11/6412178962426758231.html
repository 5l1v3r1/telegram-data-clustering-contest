        <b>Jurgen Klopp has said he was surprised to see Mauricio Pochettino sacked at Tottenham and believes <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/managers/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> was “desperate” to get back into the Premier League.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Spurs sent shockwaves through the Premier League this week when they followed the surprise news of <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/jose-mourinho-opens-tottenham-press-conference-with-open-invite-to-pochettino"><b>Pochettino’s sacking with the swift appointment of the former Manchester United and Chelsea boss.</b></a></p>
      <p>And Klopp admitted he was shocked to see Pochettino axed by Daniel Levy after leading Spurs to the Champions League final against his side last season.</p>
      <p>Klopp said: “Welcome back Jose, haha! It’s nice to have him back. He was desperate, you can see that from the time he was not in. How quick things change. Five months ago we played Pochettino in Champions League final, now he is on holiday. He did brilliant job at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>“When I first heard it, I couldn’t believe it in that moment. I really hope he can enjoy a few days, weeks or months off. Jose is motivated highly, so it will be interesting.</p>

      <p>“He is a great guy. My first Premier League game was against him so we have a history. Any job that is available he will be in contention. Everything will be fine for him, but it was a big one, when I first heard I couldn’t believe it. I hope Mauricio can enjoy a few weeks off.”</p>
      <p>Klopp was asked about Joe Gomez’ state of mind after his fracas with Raheem Sterling and his injury after withdrawing from the England squad last week.</p>
      <p>Klopp added: “He’s better than good. Most of the time when someone tells you and isn’t sensible with information, the people involved were fine. Things like this happen, It’s a big challenge to ask the boys [to be OK] after such a big game with each other. I cannot judge it.</p>
      <p>“The players are all good. Nothing else to say. We don’t think about the title race. Biggest challenge is facing questions about it. It’s just the season we are in. The challenges are the 26 games we have to play.”</p>
