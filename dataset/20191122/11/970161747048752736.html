      <p>Images of crying children tied to radiators and beds in a government-run psychiatric institute have sent shock waves across Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
      <p>MP Sabina Cudic made the pictures public and described the situation as ‘modern slavery’ – suggesting many of the youngsters spend most of the day and all night in degrading positions.</p>
      <p>The revelations have sparked outrage, with major concerns about the physical and mental health impact that conditions at the ‘Care of Children with Developmental Disabilities’ institution are having on the children.</p>
      <p>Ms Cudic – who unveiled the photos of the facility, in Pazaric, near Sarajevo, in front of local media and politicians on Wednesday – made an unsuccessful attempt to have the issue debated in Parliament.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘This situation can be called modern slavery. The Institute has 149 employees, including 27 economists, and 47 sick children.</p>

      <p>‘As a result of these methods, many children have serious health problems, in addition to the obvious trauma that you can see.’</p>
      <p>It is not the first time allegations about the institution have been made.</p>
      <p>On October 17 when other problems were raised, the government rejected criticism.</p>
      <p>Ms Cudic continued: ‘This is not a shock to the government, there is a long line of documented, systemic abuse of funds and the patients.</p>

      <p>‘Just two months ago, they made a very explicit statement that they are very satisfied with the conditions in Pazaric.’</p>
      <p>She also claimed that the home did not have a professional therapist until a year ago and that the night shift was covered by only one untrained individual.</p>
      <p>Yesterday around 1,000 people protested outside a government building in Sarajevo.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators included scores of parents and relatives of children with disabilities, who slated the care system as dysfunctional and condemning their kids to suffering.</p>
      <p>Sabina Sunic, who has a 17-year-old daughter with Down syndrome, said: ‘When we die there is no system, they will tie up all our children.’</p>

      <p>Aida Hrnjic, who is raising her seven-year-old autistic son at home, added: ‘The government perceives the institutions (for special needs children) as a profit-making solution.</p>
      <p>‘It is very obvious that they do not care about children.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The European Union’s office in Bosnia issued a statement describing the photos as shocking and appalling. It called on authorities ‘to thoroughly investigate these allegations immediately and to ensure swift and proper institutional follow up.’</p>
      <p>More protests have been called for today.</p>
      <p>Bosnia’s House of Representatives has announced that it has created an official task force to verify all the allegations – including a number of financial mismanagement issues – within seven days.</p>
      <p>The task force will begin immediately and report back to MPs.</p>
