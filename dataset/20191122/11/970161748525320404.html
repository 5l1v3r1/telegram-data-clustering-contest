      <p>A gran is lucky to be alive after her quick-thinking dog woke her up from a potentially fatal diabetic coma.</p>
      <p>69-year-old Pam Mansfield bought her German Shepherd Gypsy in 2013, when the dog was six weeks old.</p>
      <p>Pam, who runs a rescue centre for exotic pets, has Type 1 <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/diabetes/">diabetes</a>, which causes her to have sudden hypoglycaemic attacks if her blood sugar levels reach dangerously high or low levels.</p>
      <p>If not treated with insulin quickly enough, the lack of oxygen to the brain can cause her to fall into a coma.</p>
      <p>Scarily, she almost slipped into a coma in the early hours of Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Gypsy has never been trained to detect the signs, however she brought Pam around by licking her face and barking.</p>
      <p>Pam, a widow who has two children and two grandchildren, was in bed asleep at her home in Spalding, but at 4am she became aware of Gypsy trying to wake her.</p>

      <p>A vet told Pam that Gypsy would have smelt ketones, a substance created if the body does not get enough glucose, on her breath.</p>

      <p>She said: ‘I woke up with the dog standing over, trying to lick my face and crying and pushing up me and pushing me trying to get me to wake up. I thought, what the hell’s going on.</p>
      <p>‘She would not give up she just kept going on and on and pushing and licking and everything and I realised then, as I woke up, that I was not feeling right.</p>
      <p>‘It’s one of the worse ones I have ever had. I have not had one that caused me to wake up in the middle of the night.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t even know why because I didn’t think I should have been hungry or didn’t have enough food inside me.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t know what caused it but she woke me up and then she sat next to me on the bed. I wanted to go to the toilet but she didn’t let me leave the bed.</p>
      <p>‘She is so responsive and protective of me, I have never had a dog like her. I love her to bits.</p>
      <p>‘She means the world to me and that moment put the icing on the cake.</p>
      <p>‘If Gypsy had not woken me I would have died.’</p>
      <p>Pam keeps a bar of chocolate by her bed after suffering from a night-time hypoglycaemic attack on a previous occasion.</p>

      <p>After eating some of the chocolate she felt much better but says if Gypsy had not been there she may never have woken up.</p>
      <p>She added: ‘She got on the bed and would not leave me. I went downstairs for a drink and she followed me.</p>
      <p>‘It took me four hours to get over it. I was really wobbly and Gypsy would not leave me alone.</p>
      <p>‘I have never had such a perceptive dog. She seems to know me very well.</p>
      <p>‘She has had a lot of fuss. Everyone has been loving her since and think she’s a real celebrity.’</p>
