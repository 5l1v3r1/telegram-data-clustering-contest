                      <h3>John Terry offers puzzling reason behind Jose Mourinho overlooking De Bruyne and Salah at Chelsea</h3>
                      <p>John Terry was an amazing defender during his playing days. However, his defence of his manager was, well baffling to say the least. While speaking with <i><a href="https://twitter.com/threesixtytv/status/1197256758332461062?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197256758332461062&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.liverpoolecho.co.uk%2Fsport%2Ffootball%2Ffootball-news%2Fjohn-terry-mohamed-salah-liverpool-17294369">Dubai Eye radio</a>, </i>Terry said:</p>
                      <p>
                        <i>“In my generation now, I see people like Salah and Kevin De Bruyne come through and not being able to match his standards at the time.”</i>
                      </p>
                      <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143">
                        <anchor name="div-gpt-ad-ATD-TS-RES7">
                          <p>
                            <i>“Now they were very talented but very young individuals as well. But Mourinho didn’t have time to put them in the team or take out a Duff or Robben because we were winning every single week and his job is on the line.</i>
                          </p>
                          <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148">
                            <p>
                              <i>“So, like I said before, if you come in and you are 10 or 20 per cent below the standard of Duff and Robben who were scoring 20 goals a season each. You are not going to make that team, no chance.</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <i>“Fair play to them they’ve gone away elsewhere and proved they’re good enough but at that present time they weren’t good enough for Chelsea.”</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>Somebody needs to let Terry know that Damien Duff left Stamford Bridge in 2006 while Arjen Robben last played for Chelsea in 2007. De Bruyne joined Chelsea in 2012 while Salah arrived in 2014. That’s at least 6 years difference between Salah, De Bruyne and the illustrious pair.</p>
