      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 22): UEM Sunrise Bhd is disposing of one of its properties in Melbourne for A$125 million (RM354.6 million).</p>
      <p>It comprises a serviced apartment block that forms part of the Aurora Melbourne Central, together with 10 car park lots and part of the ground floor retail area measuring a gross floor area of 14,900 square metres (sqm).</p>
      <p>In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, UEM Sunrise said its wholly-owned subsidiary UEM Sunrise (La Trobe Street) Pty Ltd has today entered into a contract of sale with Scape Australia Management Pty Ltd.</p>
      <p>The serviced apartment includes 147 studio apartments sized between a range of 34 sqmto 37 sqm, and 105 one-bedroom apartments sized from 36 sqm to 43 sqm.</p>
      <p>Completed in September, the property has a dedicated main entrance lobby with rooms located on levels 10 to 32 of Aurora Melbourne Central.</p>
      <p>Aurora Melbourne Central itself is an 88-storey mixed-use development comprising 959 residential apartments, 252 serviced apartments, office suites and signature retail, with a total gross development value (GDV) of A$800 million.</p>
      <p>UEM Sunrise said the proposed disposal is part of its ordinary course of business as a property developer, to unlock the sales value of the property at a higher price.</p>
      <p>"UEM Sunrise group has successfully developed Aurora Melbourne Central and is now disposing its development component at a gain.<br/><br/>"The disposal allows UEM Sunrise group the ability to monetise the completed Aurora Melbourne Central components, allowing it to pursue further property development opportunities," it added.</p>
      <p>For now, UEM Sunrise has yet to determine the allocation of the utilisation of proceeds, as well as its timeline, as it is still exploring various opportunities.</p>
      <p>It added that the proposed disposal is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>Shares of UEM Sunrise went down by 1 sen or 1.32% to close at 75 sen today, for a market capitalisation of RM3.403 billion.</p>
