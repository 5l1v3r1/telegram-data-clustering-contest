      <p><b>Foxing</b> have announced a new remix collection of songs from their <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/brooklynvegans-top-50-albums-of-2018/">excellent</a> 2018 album <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/qa-w-foxing-on-the-masterful-art-rock-of-new-album-nearer-my-god/"><i>Nearer My God</i></a>, and the first remix to be released is by an artist you may not have expected to be a Foxing fan: <b>Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda</b>.</p>
      <p>“We had heard that Mike liked our record from an interview he did, so one night on tour, I said ‘fuck it’ and dm-ed him on Instagram asking if he’d be interesting in remixing. Somehow he saw it and said he would,” Foxing guitarist Eric Hudson says. “We all grew up as massive fans of Linkin Park and Mike’s solo work, so it’s truly a surreal honor to have someone of his talent and stature give a nod to a band like ours.”</p>
      <p>“‘Grand Paradise’ is my favorite track off of Nearer My God, and I’m grateful the band let me remix it,” Mike Shinoda adds. “The original has so many spectacular tracks and melodies, and I loved reinterpreting them.”</p>
      <p>Mike’s take on “Grand Paradise” comes with visualizer created by Shade Balderose of <b>Code Orange</b>. Check it out below. The other remixers lined up for this remix collection include The Chain Gang of 1974, Bas Relief, Psychic Babble and Chris P. Thompson.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Foxing are gearing up to open <b>Manchester Orchestra</b>‘s <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/foxing-oso-oso-opening-manchester-orchestras-mean-everything-to-nothing-tour/"><i>Mean Everything To Nothing</i> 10th anniversary tour</a>, alongside <b>Oso Oso</b>.
