      <p>In a recent turn of events, singer Aima Baig has revealed that she received a call from India to participate in Bigg Boss 13. However, she refused the offer due to the controversial nature of the show.</p>
      <p>Aima appeared on a recent online web show and made some confessions about her personal and professional life. She started off by talking about rumours surrounding her pictures with her friend Shahbaz Shigri to being invited to participate in Bigg Boss 13.</p>

      <p>Regarding the former, Aima clarified that she is really close friends with Shahbaz and they “vibe” really well together. However, after being pressurised further into elaborating on their relationship, the singer claimed that Shahbaz is a “cute guy” and she wouldn’t mind if something sparks between the two.</p>
      <p>After several discussions, the Pakistan Gayi singer revealed that she was offered to a part of Bigg Boss’s latest season via a phone call from the makers. However, she immediately rejected it because she feared it would put her reputation at stake. “I didn’t want to be a target on the show” she said. “Even though it would have been fun for my fans to see me locked inside the Bigg Boss House, I didn’t want that for myself. It was like putting my reputation at stake,” Aima added.</p>
      <p>Another one of Aima’s statements that sparked interest was when she claimed that model Eman Suleman and TV host Waseem Badami would be the perfect fit for Bigg Boss.</p>
