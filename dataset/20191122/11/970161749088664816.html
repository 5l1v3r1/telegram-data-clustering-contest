      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/conservative-party/">Conservative Party</a> is being given a taste of their own medicine after launching a ‘misleading’ mock Labour manifesto website.</p>
      <p>The Tories were accused of ‘dirty tricks’ when they unveiled <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/tories-launch-fake-labour-manifesto-website-despite-factcheckuk-backlash-11194311/">Labourmanifesto.co.uk</a> hours before Jeremy Corbyn <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/jeremy-corbyn-promises-scrap-tuition-fees-universal-credit-11194599/">announced his party’s election pledges</a> in Birmingham yesterday.</p>
      <p>They apparently paid Google advertising fees to make sure their website made it to the top of the page when people search ‘Labour’.</p>
      <p>But the man who made conservativemanifesto.org.uk in retaliation to the Tories tactics had his application with the search engine turned down.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Metro.co.uk, he said he was stunned by the audacity of the fake Labour manifesto site and thought he would ‘fight fire with fire’.</p>

      <p>He added: ‘If the Conservative Party can buy ads and publish misleading content then so can I.’</p>

      <p>The tech professional, 36, says he is ‘not a Labour supporter in any sense’ but ‘hates it when people are hypocrites’.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘I just wanted to poke fun of them and the way that they had tried to mislead people.’</p>
      <p>The website features messages saying the Tories are ‘laughing at you’ and ‘trying to manipulate you’.</p>
      <p>It slams the PM’s party for posting a ‘doctored’ video of Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer which makes him look like he couldn’t answer a question from Piers Morgan.</p>

      <p>The page also rips into Johnson’s record, pointing out how he was fired from The Times for fabricating a quote, once referred to homosexuals as ‘bum boys’ and described black people as ‘flag-waving piccaninnies’ with ‘watermelon smiles’.</p>
      <p>Its creator, who wants to remain anonymous, spent £40 on the project and had set aside a grand for advertising on Google.</p>
      <p>Applicants bid for particular keywords which make their ads show up and can pay to target certain areas and demographics.</p>
      <p>The website’s designer woke up this morning to an email from Google telling him he needed a certificate to advertise election ads in the European Union under the tech giant’s political content policy.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘If they’re going to do that then they should also check that you’re advertising content for your own party.’</p>

      <p>In order to give the Tories a run for their money, the worker from London says he was planning on setting up a crowdfunding website to raise £100,000 for advertising space.</p>

      <p>The fake Labour manifesto site has a message on it saying ‘a website by the Conservative Party’ and contains negative headlines about Corbyn’s plans.</p>
      <p>But the creator of conservativemanifesto.org.uk says it doesn’t sit right with him and is still trying to win over voters deceptively.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘I don’t want to call my fellow countrymen stupid, but propaganda doesn’t have to be believable to have an effect, it just has to plant a seed.’</p>
      <p>‘I think demographics who could be misled could be maybe elderly people who aren’t so familiar with the internet and technology.</p>
      <p>He warned the first thing many people read might be ‘what they latch on to’ and said the Tories wouldn’t be using this tactic if they didn’t think it would benefit them.</p>

      <p>Metro.co.uk has contacted Google and the Conservative Party for comment.</p>
      <p>Another mock website called thethetorymanifesto.com contains a list of ‘policies’ including ‘f*** the poor’, ‘f*** the homeless’, ‘f*** the disabled’ and ‘f*** you’.</p>
      <p>A note at the bottom says it is a ‘parody made in protest against the recent actions of the Conservative party and their blatant use of propaganda in the buildup to this election’.</p>

      <p>It says says the domain cost less than £1 for the year.</p>
      <p>The Conservative Party also came under fire earlier this week for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/tories-slammed-fake-fact-checking-twitter-account-election-debate-11184870/">temporarily re-naming their Twitter account to ‘factcheckUK’</a> during ITV’s leadership debate.</p>
      <p>The BBC’s Emily Maitlis’ <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/conservative-chairman-told-factcheckuk-dystopian-emily-maitlis-11186701/">called it ‘dystopian’</a> but Conservative chairman James Cleverley said ‘The Twitter handle of the CCHQ press office remained @CCHQPress so it’s clear the nature of the site.</p>
      <p>‘The reason we did that is because we were calling out the inaccuracies, the lies that were coming out during the debate. The NHS is not for sale.’</p>
