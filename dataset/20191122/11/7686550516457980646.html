      <h1>These are the worst gifts you could give your partner this Christmas, according to a study</h1>
      <h2>When it comes to gift exchange, it's the thought that counts but we're not sure if much thought has been put into some terrible gifts.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:59:26+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:59</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah McGee</a></address>
      <p>Christmas is fast approaching, which means it's time to finish off your Christmas shopping and find the perfect gift for your loved one. <br/><br/>However, not every gift exchanged on the big day is a winner and the worst gifts ever received by couple have been revealed in a recent study.</p>
      <p>A bag of rice and a toilet seat are just two gifts that people were disappointed to receive from their partner.</p>
      <p>A mop topped the terrible gift list, followed closely by a shoehorn. <br/><br/>According to the study of 2000 adults, men are also the biggest culprits when it comes to choosing the right clothes, shoes and underwear for their loved one.</p>
      <p>In fact, 1 in 20 women say their partner gets their presents wrong every single time. <br/><br/>However, women are also guilty and have disappointed their partners by giving the wrong type of aftershave, or gifting music or a box set that they don't actually like.</p>

      <p>Lorna Haddon, head of diamonds and jewellery at Beaverbrooks, carried out the study.</p>
      <p>She said: “We’ve been helping our customers choose gifts for their loved ones for 100 years, so we know how important it can be to find the perfect present.</p>
      <p>"But our research shows that many couples still struggle when it comes to finding that dream gift.</p>
      <p>“Whether it’s taking the time to choose something special together, or dropping subtle hints about what you might like to receive – there are plenty of things couples can do to make sure they are getting it right every time."</p>
      <p>The research also found that women are more likely to tell the truth if they're been gifted an item they hate; they're also more likely to drop hints about what they'd want for the festive season. <br/><br/>Couples who were honest with each other about their gift preferences have also been together for longer.</p>
      <p>The study also found almost 25% those who have been in a relationship for seven years admit they have returned a gift from their partner without telling them, compared to just 14% of couples who have been together six months.</p>
      <p>A quarter of couples sensibly opt to choose Christmas presents together rather than risking getting it wrong, while 16% of women and 15% of men share a Christmas wish list with their partners. <br/><br/>When it comes to spending, men are the most generous gifters spending around £180 on their partner while women spend £50 less.</p>
      <p>While men spend more money, women spend longer thinking about what to buy, and are more likely to buy presents earlier in the year. 1 in 10 men admit they’ll be making an emergency dash to the shops on Christmas Eve.</p>
      <h3>Dream gifts</h3>
      <p>The study has also revealed the gifts that people love to receive; take note if you've still got a lot of shopping to do. <br/><br/>Most women would love to receive a holiday (87%), followed by a necklace (81%), flowers (81%) or a ring (80%). <br/><br/>76% of women even said they'd like to unwrap diamonds on Christmas day. <br/><br/>However, if their partner gets them cleaning equipment (52%), cookery lessons (37%) and an accessory for the car (33%), then they're not likely to be happy.</p>

      <p>Men would also most like to receive a holiday (80%), followed closely by a new car (75%).</p>
      <p>However, if women are thinking of getting their partner something exercise related then you might need to reconsider, as 35% would hate to receive a gym membership and one quarter of men wouldn't be happy with exercise equipment.</p>
      <h3>The importance of a great gift</h3>
      <p>Beyond just disappointment on Christmas day, getting a terrible gift could actually bring an end to your relationship.</p>
      <p>Research by OnePoll discovered 15% of men have ended a relationship with a partner who bought them a terrible gift.</p>
      <p>This is worrying for those 71% of women who say they have have no idea what to buy their partner for Christmas this year.</p>
      <p>Contrastingly, only 8% of women have broken up over a bad gift, but 11% have been left really upset after being given something really ‘practical’ such as cleaning products or cookware.</p>
      <p>In response to the findings, the family-owned jeweller, which is celebrating its 100-year anniversary this year, has created a Christmas Gift Finder to help people pick out the perfect Christmas present for their partner.</p>
      <p>Anyone who uses the finder before Friday 13 December will be in with a chance of winning £1,000 towards their Christmas gift wish list.</p>
      <p>Lorna Haddon said: “This year we wanted to do something extra special for our customers, which is why we’ve launched our online Christmas Gift Finder to help gift givers across the UK make their Christmas truly magical.”</p>
      <p>The Christmas Gift Finder can be <a href="http://www.beaverbrooks.co.uk/christmas/gift-finder">found here</a> .</p>
