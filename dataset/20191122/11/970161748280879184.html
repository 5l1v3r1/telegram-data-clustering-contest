      <h1>House of Fraser slammed after fur appears back on the shelves</h1>

      <p>A high street store has been slated for apparently overturning its ban on animal fur.</p>
      <p>House of Fraser appears to have started to sell fur products again, despite saying in 2017 that it had a ‘strict no-fur policy’.</p>
      <p>The store – which was taken over by Sports Direct CEO Mike Ashley last year – attracted widespread criticism after garments were found lined with rabbit fur on shelves.</p>
      <p>Animal charities have slammed the revelations, which also include reports of a hats with ‘100% racoon fur’ available on the company website. The item appears to have since been removed.</p>
      <p>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Director Elisa Allen told Metro.co.uk: ‘Has House of Fraser’s new owner lost his mind, or does he just not mind losing customers?</p>

      <p>‘At a time when designers, retailers, entire councils, and high-profile individuals – including Her Majesty the Queen – are turning their backs on real animal fur, the company’s decision to start hawking it is both shameful and perplexing.</p>

      <p>‘Today’s shoppers wouldn’t be seen dead in the skins of animals. 95% per cent of the British public refuses to wear animal fur, and PETA urges House of Fraser to come to its senses, do the decent thing, and reinstate its no-fur policy immediately.’</p>
      <p>Dominic Dyer, CEO of the Badger Trust, labelled the move ‘exploitation and cruelty for profit’, while other animal charity added to the chorus of condemnation.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, it was revealed that the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/queen-vows-not-use-real-fur-outfits-will-stick-fakes-11048583/">Queen has switched to fake fur</a>.</p>

      <p>House of Fraser have been involved in controversy surrounding fur before.</p>
      <p>In 2017, an investigation found items marked as fake fur in the store were actually made with real fur.</p>
      <p>The company apologised and a spokesperson told <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/high-street-shops-in-the-uk-have-responded-to-claims-theyre-selling-real-fur-as-fake_uk_58eb4b4ee4b05413bfe4098f">HuffPost UK</a>: ‘House of Fraser has a strict no-fur policy and we ensure all of our suppliers and brand partners are aware of this.’</p>
      <p>Sports Direct Ltd, which owns House of Fraser, have not responded to multiple requests for comment.</p>
