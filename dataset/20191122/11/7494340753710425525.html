      <h1>'The Ducks Have Won': French Court Says They May Keep on Quacking</h1>

      <p>The ducks on a small French smallholding may carry on quacking, a French court ruled this week, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-ducks-idUSKBN1XT1OA">rejecting a neighbor's complaint that the birds' racket was making their life a misery</a>. From a report:<i> The court in the town of Dax ruled that the noise from the flock of around 60 ducks and geese kept by retired farmer Dominique Douthe in the foothills of the Pyrenees, southwestern France, was within acceptable limits, broadcaster France 3 said. "The ducks have won," Douthe told Reuters after the court decision. "I'm very happy because I didn't want to slaughter my ducks." The complaint was brought by Douthe's neighbor who moved from the city around a year ago into a property about 50 meters (yards) away from the enclosure in the Soustons district where Douthe keeps her flock. The dispute is the latest in a series of court cases that have pitted the traditional way of life in rural France against modern values which, country-dwellers say, are creeping in from the city.</i></p>
