      <p>Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage called the UK’s departure from the EU “just the beginning of a political revolution” as he unveiled his general election pledges today.</p>
      <p>Condemning “broken promises” of rival parties’ past manifestos, Farage said his own pamphlet did not amount to a manifesto, saying party testing found voters associated the word with another – ‘lie’.</p>
      <p>“We are the party of the new radicals,” he told his audience.</p>
      <p>Calling the voting system “hopelessly out of date” he vowed to reform postal voting, claiming it is open to abuse.</p>
      <p>And he blasted the honours system, saying the House of Lords appointments process “borders on corruption” and saying the house is “no longer fit for purpose”.</p>
      <p>Farage claimed the UK has a “highly politicised” civil service and said under Brexit Party rules civil servants would have to sign a pledge of neutrality.</p>
      <p>Another pledge would see petitions that gather 5m signatures automatically trigger a referendum, to ensure Westminster is in step with voters’ concerns.</p>
