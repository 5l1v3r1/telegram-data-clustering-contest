      <p>Hansi Flick says it is not his position to analyse the merits of other coaches amid rumours Mauricio Pochettino could become Bayern Munich's permanent new boss.</p>
      <p>Bayern, who sacked Niko Kovac earlier this month, have placed Flick in charge at the Allianz Arena until at least the Bundesliga's mid-season break.</p>
      <p>Pochettino has been linked to the post after being sacked by Tottenham this week, although reports suggest Real Madrid view the Argentine as a successor to Zinedine Zidane at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>For Flick, the only focus is on the immediate job in hand, which is Bayern's trip to Fortuna Dusseldorf on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"It is not my job to analyse coaching colleagues," he told a pre-match news conference.</p>
      <p>"The club now has all the options to look for the future, whatever they want. I'm doing my job now and trying to be successful with the team.</p>
      <p>"Football is a day-to-day business, it can be different tomorrow than yesterday. We'll wait until the winter break, then we'll sit down together."</p>

      <p>On being placed in charged for the interim, Flick added: "We prepare just as before.</p>
      <p>"I am completely satisfied with the solution. It is crucial that the club has time to think about what is right for the future."</p>
