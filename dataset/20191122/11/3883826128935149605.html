        <b>Scotland will face Israel in their one-off Euro 2020 play-off semi-final at Hampden on 26 March.</b>
      </p>
      <p>And if Steve Clarke's side progress, they will be away to Norway or Serbia for a finals place five days later.</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland will host Republic of Ireland in Belfast if both sides win their respective semi-finals at Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovakia.</p>
      <p>Israel were one of four 'Path C' teams, alongside Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary, Scotland could have drawn.</p>

      <p>Scotland earned their play-off place by winning Nations League Group C1, with Israel second.</p>
      <p>Northern and Republic of Ireland already knew their opponents, with Friday's draw deciding the host for each final.</p>
      <p>Scotland, then managed by Alex McLeish, lost 2-1 away to Israel in October 2018 before beating them 3-2 at Hampden the following month to top the group.</p>
      <p>The Scots, bidding to reach their first major tournament since the 1998 World Cup, then finished third in Euro 2020 qualifying Group I, while Israel came fifth in Group G.</p>

        <figcaption>Scotland's experience of playing Israel will help, according to head coach Steve Clarke</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Clarke's side, 53rd in the FIFA world rankings, sit 36 places higher than Israel and the semi-final will hold few fears against a side that lost their last four away Euro qualifiers.</p>
      <p>However, the potential trip to face Norway or Serbia is a daunting prospect. Norway haven't suffered a home defeat in more than three years while Serbia are ranked 33rd and played in last year's World Cup.</p>
      <p>"The good thing about playing Israel is that, although I wasn't the manger, a lot of the players played against Israel in the Nations League and will have a good understanding of what to expect," Clarke said.</p>
      <p>"I'm sure we'll go in as favourites because we have home advantage. The crowd at Hampden can be a big plus for us, I'm sure the stadium will be full and it's up to us to perform.</p>
      <p>"The most important thing is we are a host nation and don't want to be standing on the sidelines watching someone else enjoying themselves in Glasgow."</p>

      <h3>How did their qualifying group go?</h3>
      <p>Off the back of losing out to Scotland in their Nations League group, Israel started with a draw with Slovenia and wins over Austria and Latvia. However, things quickly fell apart after that. In their next seven qualifiers, Andi Herzog's side won just one - a 3-1 home win over bottom-placed Latvia - and lost five.</p>
      <p>Despite starting off in pot three side, Israel finished fifth behind Poland, Austria, North Macedonia and Slovenia - winning just one win from eight games against the four sides. There hasn't been a huge amount of evidence to suggest they've improved at all since losing 3-2 at Hampden a year ago.</p>
      <h3>Key player - Eran Zahavi</h3>
      <p>Guangzhou striker Eran Zahavi was a key player for this faltering Israeli side, scoring 11 goals in 10 qualifying games. The 32-year-old netted four of those against Austria, two against Slovenia and one against North Macedonia. He also claimed a goal and an assist at Hampden in the last meeting with Scotland.</p>
