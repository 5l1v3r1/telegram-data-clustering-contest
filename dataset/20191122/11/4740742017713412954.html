      <h1>Liberal Democrat manifesto: The key points</h1>
      <h2>The Lib Dems say remaining in the EU will create £50 billion windfall that can be used on public services</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alexandra Rogers</a></address>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats have launched their manifesto today. Its tag line? "Stop Brexit, build a brighter future".</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Lib Dems</a>' unequivocal, pro-Remain stance was made clear some time ago when they pledged to revoke Article 50 - the mechanism which allows the UK to leave the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/european-union">EU</a> - if they won a majority at the election. </p>
      <p>While this aspiration seems far off at the moment (the party is currently polling about 15 per cent, according to the BBC), the Lib Dems will hope that a raft of policies on education and childcare will give them a boost ahead of the December 12 election. </p>
      <p>Here are the key takeaways from the manifesto.</p>
      <h3>1. Brexit</h3>
      <p>In short, the party's policy is to stop it.</p>
      <p>The party will stop Brexit and use the so-called "Remain bonus" of £50 billion to invest in schools, tackling in-work poverty and inequality.</p>

      <h3>2. Education</h3>
      <p>Every adult would be given a "skills wallet" in which they would have £10,000 to spend on approved <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/education">education</a> and training courses.</p>
      <p>The government would put in £4,000 at 25, £3,000 at age 40 and £3,000 at age 55, which can be topped up by individuals, their employers and local government.</p>
      <p>The party says it would reverse cuts to school funding, recruit an extra 20,000 schoolteachers, and scrap SATs.</p>
      <h3>3. Childcare</h3>
      <p>Thirty-five hours of free childcare would be provided for every child aged two to four, and for children aged between nine and 24 months if their parents are in work.</p>
      <p>The party would also inject £1 billion a year in children’s centres  and triple the early years pupil  premium to £1,000. </p>
      <h3>4. Economy and Tax </h3>
      <p>The Lib Dems will increase corporation tax to 20 per cent and would scrap the marriage allowance tax.</p>
      <p>The capital gains tax-free allowance would be abolished in favour of taxing capital gains and salaries through a single allowance. </p>
      <p>The party would launch an independent review on how to set a “genuine” living wage across all sectors.</p>
      <h3>5. Environment</h3>
      <p>Frequent flyers would be hit with a £5bn hike to air passenger duty. </p>

      <p>All companies registered in the UK and listed on the UK stock exchanges would be forced to set targets on climate change that chime with the Paris Agreement. </p>
      <p>The Lib Dems say they would remove restrictions on solar and wind power by building more interconnectors, with the hope 80 per cent of electricity would come from renewable sources by 2030.</p>
      <p>The party would also plant 60 million trees a year and insulate all of Britain's homes by 2010. Britain’s railways would be electrified and all new cars would be electric by 2030. </p>
      <h3>6. Health </h3>
      <p>The Lib Dems would increase income tax by 1p and ring-fence the £7 billion raised for spending on the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/nhs">NHS</a> and social care. </p>
      <p>The party says it would invest £11 billion in mental health to boost access to therapy and professionals. It will make access to mental health services 24-hour, and install mental health teams in all hospitals so that those with mental health issues are "not put in police cells". </p>
      <p>The party would reform the Health and Social Care Act to "end the automatic tendering of services".</p>
      <h3>7. Immigration </h3>
      <p>There is a pledge to end the so-called hostile environment for immigrants as well as a pledge to end indefinite detention, and the Home Office would be stripped of its powers.</p>
      <p>Asylum seekers will be given the right to work three months after they have applied, and 10,000 unaccompanied refugee children in the UK will be resettled over the decade.</p>

      <h3>8. Housing</h3>
      <p>The Lib Dem manifesto contains the commitment to build 100,000 homes for social rent each year, and to ensure that this figure increases to 300,000 new homes a year by 2024.</p>
      <p>The pledge will be met through a £130 billion package of additional infrastructure investment, taking advantage of low interest rates.</p>
      <p>The party would also introduce a new "Rent to Own model" for social housing, where tenants are given an increasing stake in the property through their rent payments, eventually owning the property after 30 years.  </p>
      <p>And local councils will be allowed to increase council tax by up to 500 per cent on second homes, with a stamp duty surcharge on overseas residents purchasing such properties.</p>
