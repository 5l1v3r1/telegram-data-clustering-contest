      <p>Most of us tend to know that taking care of animals requires not just money, but plenty of love, empathy and compassion. After all, itâ€™s the least that we can offer these creatures when we take them into our homes as part of our family.</p>

      <p>But as we have come to learn, not every person is capable of providing that same degree of empathy and compassion to animals. In fact, there are some people who donâ€™t have any of it to spare, as this report from <a href="https://www.sinchew.com.my/content/content_2150756.html?fbclid=IwAR10L9wS2MEQJ7vU1ZuA5FntJfXsdKZfl7UVtSY4xi3OGBas_NOBUcM4f_I">Sin Chew Daily</a> goes to show.</p>
      <p>Just recently, a poor elderly German Shepard was found to have been <b>cruelly chained up by its owner and left to starve outside his home</b> in a pet carrier by a delivery man in New York State.</p>

      <p>The delivery driver was reported to have said that when he found the German Shepard, it was starving and<b> looked as though it had part of its leg â€˜blown offâ€™</b>. Without thinking twice, he quickly rescued the dog and brought her to a veterinary clinic.</p>

      <p>Upon inspection, it was revealed that the nine-year-old German Shepard, named Zoe, was<b> completely emancipated and malnourished as a result of not being fed for some considerable amount of time.</b> And remember the leg that appeared â€˜blown offâ€™?</p>
      <blockquote>As it turns out, Zoe had been chewing on her own leg out of hunger, and had tried to survive by eating it.</blockquote>
      <p>A member of the Â Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) said that <b>X-rays of Zoeâ€™s stomach showed that her belly contained a number of bones that were consistent to the shape and size of leg bones in dogs of her breed</b>, thus confirming that she had eaten her own leg.</p>

      <p>Had she not been brought in sooner, it is likely that Zoe would have died from exposure, as well as the severity of her injuries. It is also reported that her owner is now facing criminal charges for animal abuse.</p>
      <p>
        <i>We wish Zoe a speedy recovery, and hope that her owner is held accountable for this horrific show of negligence!Â </i>
