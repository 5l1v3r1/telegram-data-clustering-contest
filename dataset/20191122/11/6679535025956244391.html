      <h2>Malayalm actor says that his role in ‘Odunnon’ has been one of the most challenging of his career</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:08:28+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/PK-Ajith-Kumar-22881/" target="_blank">PK Ajith Kumar</a></address>
      <p>Santhosh Keezhattoor may not have had too many author-backed roles in his career in Malayalam cinema yet, but he has proved his talent every time he was given an opportunity. It is not often that a film revolves completely around him. <i>Odunnon </i>does.</p>
      <p>The film, which reached cinemas this week, has given Santhosh one of his most challenging roles of his career. He plays a man who is gripped by an unusual fear of snakes. “It is the kind of a role an actor dreams of,” says Santhosh, who was in Kozhikode to promote the film. “When the film's director, Noushad Ibrahim told me about <i>Odunnon</i>, I decided to do it right away.”</p>
      <p>It is Noushad’s directorial début, but Santhosh has known him for several years. Both have a background in theatre and have been winners of the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi Awards for best actor.</p>
      <p>“The year Noushad won for his performance in the title role of <i>Thacholi Othenan</i>, I had given him the toughest competition with my performance as Ochira Velukkutty in <i>Avathara Purushan</i>,” says Santhosh. “I told Noushad that I didn’t mind losing that award, because he was the winner.”</p>
      <p>That was in 2009. At that time he could not have imagined that he would act in a film directed by Noushad.</p>

      <p>“I liked the concept of <i>Odunnon</i>,” says Santhosh. “And it has been a very challenging role, physically and mentally. I am an actor who loves to act my whole body rather than dialogues.”</p>
      <p>Since his character in <i>Odunnon</i> is someone who keeps on running, that too barefoot, filming was tough for him. “For one of the sequences, I had to run non-stop for two-and-a-half hours, and it was a difficult terrain too, with so many sharp-edged stones along the way,” he says.</p>
      <p>But he didn’t mind the hardships. “A role like this does not come easily in Malayalam cinema, where it is easy to get typecast,” he says. “But I am grateful to cinema, though. I am recognised for my work in films, and not for the best-actor award I won for theatre.”</p>
      <p>His roles in <i>Pulimurugan</i> and <i>Vikramadithya</i><i>n</i><i> </i>that made him popular. “But some of the good I work did went unnoticed because they were much smaller films,” he says. “<i>Samarpanam</i> and <i>Nilavariyathe</i> were fine films, but hardly anyone watched them in cinemas. Many peoplecalled me up after watching <i>Samarpanam</i> on online streaming services, though.”</p>
      <p>He says he has interesting roles in upcoming films, like <i>Kallan</i>, <i>Vellam</i> and <i>Bhoomiyile Manohara</i><i>Swakaryam</i>. And once he finishes his assignments, he wants to go back to the stage and get dressed in saris and put on his long wig once again, for his one-man play <i>Pen Nadan</i>.</p>
      <p>His portrayal of an actor who became a legend for portraying female roles, at a time when women did not dare to act in Kerala, has wowed audiences across the country and even overseas.</p>
      <p>“No role has given me as much appreciation or gratification,” he says. “But that was possible because of the popularity I gained as a film actor.”</p>
