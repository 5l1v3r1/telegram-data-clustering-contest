      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mohammed-shami/">Mohammed Shami</a> hit Bangladesh batsman Mohammad Nayeem on the helmet with a bouncer in the 22nd over, leading to some concern in the field.</p>
      <p>The ball flew off the side of the batsmanâ€™s helmet into the hands of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/virat-kohli/">Virat Kohli</a> at slip but there was no appeal. The India fielders swarmed around the batsman in concern.</p>

      <p>Umpire Joel Wilson, after a chat with India skipper Kohli, was seen calling over Nitin Patel, the India physio, who had stepped onto the field at the time.</p>
      <p>Concussion tests were done on the batsman, after which Nayeem gave a thumbs-up sign. Patel gave him a tap on the shoulder and Nayeem smiled in reaction.</p>

      <p>Nayeem would move on from the moment, but the Bangladesh innings would be wrapped up by Tea for 106, with <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ishant-sharma/">Ishant Sharma</a> (5 wickets), <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/umesh-yadav/">Umesh Yadav</a> (3 wickets) and Mohammed Shami (2 wickets) accounting for all 10 wickets.</p>
