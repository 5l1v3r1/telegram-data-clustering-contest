      <h1>Baby Yoda Merch Is Coming</h1>
      <h2>The show may be called The Mandalorian, but it's Baby Yoda who steals it</h2>

      <p>The House of Mouse certainly doesn’t need the media’s help to move merchandise, but as anyone who’s watched at least the first episode of Disney+ <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Star+Wars">Star Wars</a></i> series <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/11/the-mandalorian-review-spoilers.html">The Mandalorian</a></i> knows, Baby Yoda is a gift to our cold, dark world—the 50-year-old alien who shares only the actual Yoda’s unspecified species is so cute, the very sight of him <a href="https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1195450147666350080">made Werner Herzog weep</a>—and we felt compelled to let you know he’s got merch on the way.</p>
      <p>As <i><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/baby-yoda-apparel-accessories-toys-and-plush-are-coming.html">CNBC</a></i> first reported, <i>The Mandalorian</i>’s breakout character, officially known simply as “The Child,” was kept out of the show’s marketing and initial run of merchandise at the behest of showrunners <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Jon+Favreau">Jon Favreau</a> and Dave Filoni, who wanted to ensure that the character’s appearance at the end of the first episode (which, uh, spoiler alert?) stayed a surprise. Various Baby Yoda apparel and accessories are reportedly coming to Amazon (where <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Mandalorian-Poster-T-Shirt/dp/B081R55V3L/">two T-shirts</a> are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Mandalorian-Portrait-Premium/dp/B081R581PK/">already available</a> as of this writing), Zazzle, Target, Kohl’s, Macy’s, Hot Topic and Box Lunch, as well as the Disney Store, ShopDisney and Disney parks as early as today (Nov. 22). And more merch, including toys and plush, are on the way in the coming weeks. That sound you hear in the distance is the “ka-ching” of countless cash registers.</p>
      <p>Three episodes of <i>The Mandalorian</i> have debuted on Disney+ thus far, the latest streaming as of today. Pedro Pascal stars as the titular character, a Boba Fett-esque Mandalorian bounty hunter who is tasked with capturing a high-value, secretive target, and is dismayed to discover that said target is the obscenely adorable “Child.” Conundrum!</p>
      <p>Apropos of nothing at all, read <i>Paste</i> TV Editor Allison Keene’s take on <i>The Mandalorian</i>’s feat of capitalist engineering <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/11/the-mandalorian-episode-2-toys.html">here</a>, and watch her discuss Baby Yoda with <i>Paste</i> Editor-in-Chief Josh Jackson below.</p>
