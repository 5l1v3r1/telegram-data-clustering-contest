      <p>A West Lothian road was closed this morning following a road collision between a car and a school bus.</p>
      <p>Emergency services were called to the scene just outside Armadale Academy after 8am but no serious injuries have been reported.</p>
      <p>A stretch of the A89 was closed in both directions through to Blackridge in the west and drivers were advised to avoid the area.</p>
      <p>The bus was not for Armadale Academy and was travelling to St Kentigern’s Academy in Blackburn and did not have any passengers on board at the time of the crash.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Police Scotland said: “Police were called around 8am on Friday, November 22, following reports of a two-vehicle RTC involving a car and a bus on the A89, Armadale.</p>
      <p>“The road was briefly closed and has now re-opened. There are no serious injuries.”</p>
