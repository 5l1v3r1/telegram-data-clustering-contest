      <p>Dozens of migrants have been rescued from a refrigerated lorry that was 'losing oxygen' on its way to the United States.</p>
      <p>Dramatic video shows Mexico’s federal police slowly opening the doors of the truck with a Danone logo emblazoned on the back of it.</p>
      <p>Inside, children, men and women are crammed from wall to wall.</p>
      <p>The migrants were stopped on a motorway in Veracruz in southern Mexico.</p>
      <p>They had been in the lorry for two days, starting in Chiapas, a southern Mexican state bordering Guetamala.</p>
      <p>Local media reports vary on the number of migrants found inside but the number is thought to be between 58 and 62.</p>
      <p>Some reports say there were 45 men and 13 women. Eighteen of the 58 migrants are thought to be minors.</p>

      <p>Among the migrants were a pregnant woman, minors, women and men, most of whom are Guatemalans, <a href="https://diariocdmx.com.mx/noticias/mexico/encuentran-camion-falso-de-danone-con-migrantes-en-veracruz/">Diario Digital, reports.</a></p>
      <p>The police were reportedly carrying out random spot checks, however, the footage shows one of the officers filming the opening of the lorry doors on a mobile phone, indicating they knew what they were about to find.</p>
      <p>When the doors are opened, the migrants, who are sitting and standing, barely react. Possessions such as teddy bears, matt seats and towels can be seen squashed in among the group.</p>

      <p>Some of the migrants reportedly claimed they were starting to suffer from a lack of oxygen and had warned the driver about the situation but he did not stop the vehicle.</p>
      <p>After struggling to cope with the heat of the lorry, the migrants had broken part of the door with an axe, which the federal police noticed, according to Diario Digital.</p>
      <p>One Guatemalan migrant said: “Yes, it was already very hot, it was time for him to stop and he didn't stop and they had to break the door. I did not see it, but I did hear about 3 or 4 shots and I said, why they [traffickers] have no conscience, we are all worth the same.”</p>
      <p>The driver and the co-driver have been arrested and transferred to the attorney General’s Office in Coatzacoalcos, a city in the north of Veracruz.</p>
      <p>Danone Mexico has denied a company lorry was used for trafficking and has said it is a fake logo.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said a criminal complaint has been launched and the company will collaborate with the authorities to confirm the vehicle is counterfeit.</p>
      <p>The Red Cross treated the migrants for health issues before they were taken to a migrant centre in Veracruz.</p>
