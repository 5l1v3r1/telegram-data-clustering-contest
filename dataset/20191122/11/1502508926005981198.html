      <p>The BJP was outsmarted on Friday by emerging political combinations in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/maharashtra">Maharashtra </a>and lost mayoral polls in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/latur">Latur </a>and Ulhasnagar despite having a majority in both civic bodies.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>managed to win the posts of mayor and deputy mayor in Mumbai and neghbouring <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/thane">Thane.</a></p>
      <p>The BJP, however, managed to keep its flock together and got the support of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/maharashtra">Maharashtra </a>Navnirman Sena to win the posts of mayor and deputy mayor in Nashik.</p>
      <p>In Latur, the Congress' Vikrant Gojamgunde was elected mayor, in what is being seen as a setback for former BJP minister Sambhaji Nilangekar.</p>
      <p>In Ulhasnagar, the BJP, despite having a majority in the municipal corporation, was beaten by former saffron ally <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>which won the mayor's post after it got the support of the NCP, Congress and a local outfit called Team Omi Kalani (TOK).</p>
      <p>In Mumbai, the Sena's Kishori Pednekar and Suhas Wadkar were elected unopposed as mayor and deputy mayor respectively as the BJP did not field candidates for the two posts.</p>
      <p>The Sena's Naresh Mhaske and Pallavi Kadam were elected mayor and deputy mayor respectively of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/thane">Thane </a>Municipal Corporation.</p>
      <p>In Parbhani, Anita Sonkamble and Bhagwan Waghmare of the Congress, which is the largest party in the civic body, were elected mayor and deputy mayor.</p>
      <p>In Nashik, Satish Kulkarni of the BJP was elected mayor after a group of its corporators, who were cosying up to the Sena, stayed back.</p>
      <p>With five MNS corporators also voting for the BJP candidates in the Nashik Municipal Corporation, the latter won the deputy mayor's post as well, with 82-year Bhikubai Bagul getting the post unopposed.</p>
      <p>In the 70-member <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/latur">Latur </a>civic body, BJP had 36 and Congress 33 corporators while the NCP had one. One BJP corporator died and the lone NCP corporator joined the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi.</p>
      <p>During polls on Friday, two BJP corporators and the lone one from VBA voted for the Congress, while one corporator from the Congress, Sachin Mhaske, was absent.</p>
      <p>A rebel BJP corporator, Chandrakant Birajdar, was elected <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/latur">Latur </a>deputy mayor after he defeated his former colleague Bhagyashree Koulkhere with the help of the Congress.</p>
      <p>Although the ruling BJP had a clear majority in the Nashik Municipal Corporation, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>tried garnering support from the Congress, NCP and MNS, similar to its efforts for forming a government in the state.</p>
      <p>Former mayor Balasaheb Sanap had left the BJP and joined the NCP to contest the recent state Assembly polls, after the former denied him a ticket. He then went on to join the Shiv Sena.</p>
      <p>Around 10 to 15 of Sanap's supporters were won over by Shiv Sena, making things difficult for the BJP.</p>
      <p>While Ajay Boraste was the Sena's candidate for the Nashik mayor's post, Kamalesh Bodke was chosen by the party for the deputy mayor's post.</p>
      <p>However, all equations changed at the last minute, when MNS decided to back the BJP in NMC.</p>
