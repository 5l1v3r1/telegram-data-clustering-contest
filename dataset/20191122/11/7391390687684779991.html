      <p>The UK's favourite soap star turned pop icon has enjoyed many milestones throughout her illustrious career, and after a string of majorly successful summertime shows, Kylie Minogue has most definitely certified herself as a pop music legend. So, will fans of the Aussie singer be lucky enough to see her perform again? And <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/will-celine-dion-tour-the-uk-in-2020-the-canadian-icon-has-some-major-projects-in-the-pipeline-18806155">will Kylie Minogue tour the UK in 2020?</a> Here's everything you need to know.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the "Can't Get You Out of My Head" performer <a href="https://www.kylie.com/">doesn't appear to have any UK shows</a> in the pipeline, however, this doesn't mean a future tour won't be announced down the line. I have reached out to the singer's representatives for comment, and will update with any news the second it becomes available.</p>
      <p>Although a 2020 tour is yet to be announced, Kylie fans have had <i>a lot</i> to celebrate over the past year, including a series of sold-out performances at some impressive outdoor venues, including London's Hampton Court Palace, Edinburgh Castle, and more. As <i>NME</i> reports, Minogue also made her <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/kylie-minogue-announces-outdoor-uk-tour-summer-2019-tickets-2401384">grand return to the Glastonbury stage</a> in the coveted legends slot, after previously pulling out of the festival back in 2005 following a breast cancer diagnosis.</p>
      <p>According to the Official Charts, Kylie fans have <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/kylie-minogue-announces-golden-live-album-dvd-and-expanded-step-back-in-time-greatest-hits__27460/">some <i>very</i> exciting releases</a> to look forward, including a special edition of the singer's greatest hits album <i>Step Back In Time</i> — which is <a href="https://www.kylie.com/">available to purchase now</a>. The newly-released album features 50 of Minogue's past singles, which includes a party mega-mix, and if that wasn't enough to satisfy your Kylie obsession, the "Slow" singer is also set to drop the <a href="https://kylie.lnk.to/GoldenDVDWe"><i>Golden: Live in Concert</i> album</a> and DVD on Friday, December 6 — which features full live performances of her recent <i>Golden</i> tour, and an array of extra bonus features. With these new additions to her already impressive discography, Minogue is presumably hoping to mirror <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/kylie-minogue-announces-golden-live-album-dvd-and-expanded-step-back-in-time-greatest-hits__27460/">the success of her previous two efforts</a>, both of which landed straight in at the top of the charts upon their release.</p>

      <p>As<i> Metro</i> reports, fans also won't be able to escape the "Lucky" singer throughout the festive season, as the Aussie pop queen is set to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/kylie-minogue-to-surprise-fans-with-exclusive-concert-and-gifts-for-new-christmas-special-11071452/">front her very own Christmas special</a> titled <i>Kylie's Secret Night</i>. The one-off programme is due to air on Channel 4 and be hosted by funnyman Alan Carr, who will oversee Kylie's yuletide spectacular — during which the singer will pull-off a musical extravaganza filled with surprises, money-can’t-buy gifts, and much more.</p>
      <p>So, the next couple of months are looking <i>extremely</i> good for Kylie fans and I for one couldn't be more here for it.</p>
