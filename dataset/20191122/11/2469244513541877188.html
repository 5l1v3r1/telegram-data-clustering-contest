      <p>A 20-year-old man has pleaded not guilty to causing the death of a 16-year-old boy who was a passenger in his car when it crashed into a tree stump.</p>
      <p>Brandon Martin died in the accident on the A3181 between Cullompton and Willand when he was the front seat passenger in a Toyota Celica car which left the road and hit the stump on October 21, 2018.</p>
      <p>Jordan Sturcbecher, aged 20, of Orchard Way, Cullompton, denied causing death by dangerous driving when he appeared at Exeter Crown Court.</p>
      <p>Judge Timothy Rose adjourned the case for a four-day trial on May 4  next year and set a timetable for the exchange of prosecution and defence papers, which will include specialist collision investigator and vehicle examiner reports.</p>
      <p>Sturcbecher was released on bail.</p>
      <p>Emergency services were called to an area known as Five Bridges at around 1.50 am on Sunday October 21 last year after the car left the road, hit a tree stump and overturned.</p>
      <p>Front seat passenger Brandon, from Cullompton, sustained fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver was treated for minor injuries.</p>

      <p>A large number of floral tributes were left at the scene of the accident, which was close to the Diggerland tourist attraction, where Brandon had worked since leaving school.</p>
      <p>His family set up a fund raising page on the internet to raise money for a permanent memorial.</p>
