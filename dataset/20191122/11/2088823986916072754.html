      <p>This week of practice has been like no other for the Western New York Maritime/Health Sciences football team.</p>
      <p>In addition to the increased spotlight on the Falcons as a first-time state semifinalist, they have been preparing for their biggest game yet on an official field. With lines and everything.</p>
      <p>They’ve been allowed to use Johnnie B. Wiley Pavilion, as a favor from the Buffalo Public Schools, which runs the facility.</p>
      <p>Excuse the second-year Falcons, if they suddenly feel like they’re being spoiled.</p>
      <p>Just last week, they practiced at dusk in snow deep enough to make snow angels within sight of Johnnie B.</p>
      <p>Coach Tyree Parker tweeted a video with the caption, "Rain sleet or snow @MHSFalconsFB working!!!" and noted that the Falcons didn't have a stadium with lights. For most of the season, they practiced on a patch of grass near the old Rockpile.</p>
      <p>Not this week. Consider it a perk for making the New York State Public High School Athletic Association Final Four.</p>

      <p>“It’s a great opportunity to play inside a stadium just from a fact the alignment of our players,” Parker said. “When you’re playing on a grass space, the kids don’t know the proper spacing. Now that we have an opportunity to practice inside a stadium now, we can tell the kids to line up on the hash marks or on top of the numbers or above the numbers. Those are the things we couldn’t teach them on a grass field.</p>
      <p>"We did the best we could with cones and stuff like that but it’s nothing like being on an actual football field where the kids know exactly where to be on game time.”</p>
      <p>The Falcons (10-1) have done pretty well without the luxury of a home field.</p>

      <p>The Falcons hope to do even better Saturday afternoon at Cicero-North Syracuse High School in Onondaga County, where they face Section IV champion and state No. 1 Chenango Forks (11-0). The winner advances to the NYSPHSAA championship game Dec. 1 at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse.</p>
      <p>The Falcons, ranked fifth in the state, are one of four area football teams still vying for championships late in November.</p>
      <p>On Friday, defending Class D state champion Clymer/Sherman/Panama (9-1) squares off with top-ranked Tioga (11-0) of Section IV in a state semifinal at C-NS. The 5 p.m. game isn't just a rematch from last year's semifinal but also is a No. 1 versus No. 2 clash of state-ranked teams. On Saturday, Southwestern (11-0) kicks off a tripleheader of games at C-NS at noon when it faces IV-Susquehanna Valley (11-0) in another showdown between the top-two ranked teams in the state in their respective classification. SV is ranked first. The Falcons’ contest against Forks follows at 3 p.m.</p>

      <p>Those wanting to see a state championship game a week early can do so and not have to travel too far. Monsignor Martin champion Canisius (6-5) hosts New York City Catholic Football League champ Cardinal Hayes (7-4) at 1 p.m. at the Stransky Complex in West Seneca in the New York State Catholic High Schools Athletic Association final. Hayes is ranked No. 5 in the state Class AA poll, while the Crusaders are 27th.</p>
      <p>The other schools still playing have football programs with great history.</p>
      <p>History for the Western New York Maritime/Health Sciences program dates back to last season, but the only charter-school football team in Section VI has now won division, sectional and regional titles.</p>
      <p>The program is made up of two inner-city charter schools roughly 10 minutes apart. Eighteen players attend Maritime; 16 players attend Health Sciences. Parker prefers the name "Falcons" to emphasize that it is one team, not two schools.</p>
      <p>“It’s great for the program because when you’re winning, winning recruits itself,” Parker said. “The kids want to be part of a winning tradition. I’m not saying we’re always going to be successful but for us to go from 2-6 to 10-1 shows the character of our team, the type of players we have in our program, and they’re great students as well.”</p>
      <p>“It’s amazing,” added senior running back John Washington.</p>
      <p>It is.</p>
      <p>The young Falcons have won 12 games as a program. They are facing a program that has nearly as many final four wins (11) as they do all-time wins. Chenango Forks holds the state record for most final fours (15) and had a run of five consecutive semifinal appearances snapped last year by Section III’s Skaneateles.</p>
      <p>“They’re a good football program. We’re a good football program,” Parker said. “In order to be the best you have to beat the best.”</p>
      <p>Football observers in the area believed the Falcons would become a contender sooner rather than later, with the combined charter-school team providing another high school option for city kids searching for the right education and athletics mix. Yet sooner happened quicker than anyone expected.</p>
      <p>“I’m shocked that we’ve made it this far,” Washington said. “I’d be lying if I said I knew we were going to states. I’d be lying if I said we knew we were going to win at The Ralph. But I did think we were going to be better than what we were last year, 2-6. To come this far is great as a second-year program."</p>
      <p>Bonding off the field and hitting offseason workouts hard have played a role in the success. So, too, has the fact the older players on the team, who had gone at least a year without playing football, have gotten re-acclimated to playing the sport after a brief layoff. They also didn’t like the fact they lost more than they won last year.</p>
      <p>“I think last year left a chip on everybody’s shoulder,” said sophomore standout Addison Copeland, who already has offers from BYU and Northwestern. “I know a lot of them that came back, like John Washington and (lineman) Shakeem Mallory, they wanted to make their senior year memorable. So, it just put a chip on their shoulder to do better.”</p>
      <p>“Nobody gave up on the team and I think that’s what really changed us this year,” Washington said. “Everybody stuck together. Nobody said we’re done (and left the program).”</p>
      <p>The reward is being one of four teams still playing football, with a chance to hoist a state-championship plaque.</p>
      <p>It might feel good being spoiled, but the Falcons know what got them to this point.</p>
      <p>“We don’t really have as much as the other schools have, equipment wise and financially,” said Copeland, who said he was among several players who made snow angels last week. “We had to make everything work. … We made fun out of it, so it didn’t really seem like a drag to us. It made it seem like we were practicing for football.</p>
      <p>“It’s just hard work. We had a stadium next to us the whole year and we’re practicing in a backyard with mud and potholes. And the whole time we play, we play traveling, so a lot of odds were against us. It was just hard work and playing as a family.”</p>
      <p>“We made do with what we had,” Washington said. “That’s why I think we win a lot. We pull through as a team.”</p>
      <p>Parker, who was the team's assistant head coach last season, said the program is looking into potentially using Johnnie B. Wiley for home games next year.</p>
      <p>The Falcons hosted their two playoff games there last month, but the facility often is used for boys and girls soccer by the BPS during the fall, although Hutch-Tech football also played there one home game during the season.</p>
      <p>The idea to start the program last year came from Maritime athletic director Charlie Comerford, Health Sciences principal and athletic director Robert Baxter and Parker, the assistant athletic director at Health Sciences who led the boys basketball team to back-to-back state Class B semifinals in 2017 and 2018. Comerford served as head coach in the first season and stepped down before this season.</p>
      <p>Whether other charter schools follow suit remains to be seen. Section VI Football Chairman Ken Stoldt said as of now he hasn’t received any inquiries about adding the sport.</p>
      <p>Of course, that could change down the road.</p>
      <p>For now, it's all about seeing just how high the Falcons can continue to soar.</p>
      <p>"I think we’re prepared," Washington said. "Hopefully we come out on top.”</p>
