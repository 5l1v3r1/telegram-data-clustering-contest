      </p>
      <p>Nigeria and Leicester City defensive midfielder Wilfred Ndidi has revealed plans to build a school which will also act as a football academy to help aspiring youngsters study while playing football.</p>
      <p>The 2019 Africa Cup of Nations bronze-winning star is currently studying Business and Management course at the De Montfort University.</p>
      <p>Ndidi, 23, enrolled in the school earlier this year, and the <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/695-super-eagles.html">Super Eagles</a> star said he would rather acquire more knowledge than sit down to play FIFA.</p>
      <p>The former Genk star has scored two goals in 11 Premier League appearances for the Foxes so far this campaign - despite playing in the non-scoring department.</p>
