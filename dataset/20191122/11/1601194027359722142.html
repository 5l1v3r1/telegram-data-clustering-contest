      <p>Tom Blundell is on standby to replace Henry Nicholls against England if the New Zealand batsman is ruled out of the remainder of the first Test.</p>
      <p>Nicholls was struck on the helmet by a bouncer from England paceman Jofra Archer in the penultimate over on day two at Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old was able to remain at the crease and was unbeaten on 26 at stumps, with the Black Caps 144-4 in reply to the tourists' 353 all out.</p>

      <p>New Zealand paceman Tim Southee said: "He's a pretty tough character so he'll rest up tonight, a couple of Panadol and be back out there.</p>
      <p>"He'll be assessed later on tonight and again in the morning, that's the protocol.</p>
      <p>"He's shaping up all right at the moment so fingers crossed he'll be right."</p>
      <p>Sam Curran took the big scalp of Kane Williamson for 51 after also removing Tom Latham.</p>
      <p>Ben Stokes earlier top-scored with 91 for England, with Southee taking 4-86 in an opening match of the series that is nicely poised.</p>
