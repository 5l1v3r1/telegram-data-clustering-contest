      <h1>Get Bad North: Jotunn Edition For Free On Epic Games Store For A Limited Time</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:44:15+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/bryanlim/" target="_blank">Bryan Lim</a></address>
      <p>Yet another free game is available on Epic Games Store this week. This time around, the storefront is offering Bad North: Jotunn Edition at no charge. On a side note, it seems like Epic Games Store is cutting down the usual two free games format to just one game from now on.</p>
      <p>Bad North is a real-time strategy game stylised in an illustrated cartoon design. Your main goal is to defend your kingdom from a Viking invasion, while at the same time guiding your people to evacuate.</p>
      <p>The game comes with its Jotunn downloadable content (DLC) that was released back in July. On top of the base game, the DLC adds new commander traits to the player, introduces new enemy types, and checkpoint islands. Bad North is a fairly recent game, as it was released last year on 17 November.</p>
