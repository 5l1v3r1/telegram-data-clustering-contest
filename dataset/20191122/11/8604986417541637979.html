      <h1>Apple Quietly Made One Big Change to Its Online Store That Other Retailers Should Follow</h1>
      <h2>A nice idea, but not one that provides much value.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:44:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:44</time> by <a rel="author">Don Reisinger</a></address>
      <p>If there's anything useless for an online store to have, <a href="https://www.inc.com/craig-bloem/84-percent-of-people-trust-online-reviews-as-much-.html">it may just be user reviews</a>. And Apple seems to know that.</p>
      <p>At some point over the few weeks, Apple quietly removed all product reviews from its online store, according to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/21/apple-ratings-and-reviews-online-store/">Apple-tracking site 9to5Mac</a>. Apple made no mention of the decision, but anyone visiting the company's online store will now find that the "Ratings and Reviews" section gone. A "Questions and Answers" section is still available.</p>
      <p>Of course, some critics <a href="https://www.inc.com/craig-bloem/want-to-grow-your-small-business-use-online-review-sites-right-way.html">interpret Apple's decision as self-serving</a>. The company must have taken issue with negative reviews and rather than allow users to speak freely about products they've purchased, Apple is instead stopping reviews entirely.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20976335/apple-customer-reviews-removed-online-store-rating">According to The Verge</a>, which looked at Apple's online reviews before they were taken down, there were plenty of people who were ready and willing to share negative thoughts. The company's Lightning to 3.55mm headphone jack adapter, for instance, had a whopping 700 one star reviews.</p>
      <p>But before we immediately go negative here, perhaps we should keep in mind that <a href="https://www.inc.com/peter-roesler/new-research-reveals-secret-to-better-online-reviews.html">online reviews are notoriously unreliable</a>. Sure, there are plenty of legitimate reviews where people share their real feelings to help others, but there are also plenty of reviews that are useless, intentionally negative, or anecdotal and in no way reflective of the average person's user experience.</p>
      <p>Worse yet, online reviews are notoriously fake. In fact, sites like <a href="https://www.fakespot.com/">FakeSpot</a> and others have made a name for themselves for helping users find the fake online reviews to see whether high or low ratings are really legitimate or crafted to make a product look good or bad.</p>
      <p>Online reviews, in other words, are helpful in only specific cases. In a large number of cases, they're downright useless.</p>
      <p>So before we start criticizing Apple for the move, we should perhaps consider that. And also consider that even if people want reviews from users on their experience with a device, they can go to Amazon, Best Buy, and other online retailers where user reviews are still available.</p>
      <p>That said, I think it's time we rethink user reviews. Given the concerns that we all have about their legitimacy, at the very least, we need to do a better job of informing users that there's a chance a user review they're seeing may not be real. We should also acknowledge to them that trying to root out a fake is far from simple. So, while there's a chance what you're seeing is real, there's also a chance that what you're seeing isn't real.</p>
      <p>Suffice it to say that Apple's move makes more sense than some might think at first glance. And more online retailers should consider following the Apple's lead.</p>
