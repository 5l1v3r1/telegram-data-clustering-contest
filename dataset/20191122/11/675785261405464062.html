      <h1>Bride with cancer has arm amputated to buy herself time to find and marry soulmate</h1>
      <h2>Shannon Lynch has battled a rare cancer in her elbow for the last six years and now has less than a year left to live</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:34:17+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:34</time> by <a rel="author">Kelly-Ann Mills, Charlotte Penketh-King, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>A woman with terminal cancer had her arm amputated in a desperate bid to give herself more time to find and marry the man of her dreams.</p>
      <p>Shannon Lynch has battled a rare cancer in her elbow for the last six years and had her arm amputated in 2017 to stem the progress of the disease.</p>
      <p>But the cancer has now returned and doctors have given the 21-year-old just a year to live.</p>
      <p>The drastic operation bought her enough precious time to meet Ashley, 18, and walk down the aisle before the cancer claims her life.</p>
      <p>The couple, from Edenbridge, Kent, are now making the most of the short time they have together as husband and wife.</p>
      <p>Shannon said: "My wedding day meant everything to me, and it's lovely to be able to show the world that I'm devoted to the one I love for the rest of my life.</p>

      <p>"It doesn't matter how long I have with him, as long as I'm with him and we are happy.</p>
      <p>"Married life is better than I ever thought it could be, it's better than people say it is, I'm always happy when I'm with him.</p>
      <p>"We are trying to make memories together but it's hard at the same time because I can get ill and tired very quickly."</p>
      <p>Shannon's battle with cancer began when she was just 15 with her pain initially dismissed as 'tennis elbow', but after the lump grew bigger and more painful, she was sent for an ultrasound, blood test and biopsy.</p>
      <p>In July 2013, Shannon was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma - a rare type of cancer that affects soft tissues.</p>
      <p>The young teenager underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment before having an operation in March 2014 to remove the lump.</p>
      <p>Shannon had check ups every three months to make sure the cancer hadn't returned but was devastated when another lump appeared in July 2017.</p>
      <p>The cancer was back in the form of a Grade 3 sarcoma, and in order to stop the cancer from spreading further, the doctors had to amputate Shannon's right arm.</p>

      <p>Shannon said: "I knew giving up my right arm could be a struggle for me as I would have to learn to write and do activities with my opposite arm.</p>
      <p>"If I didn't have my right arm amputated, then I would have got tumours in my lungs a lot earlier. It was simple - either die or have it removed. So it set it in stone for me.</p>
      <p>"When I woke up after surgery, the first thing I did was look at my arm and saw they saved a lot more than I'd expected - I thought my entire arm would have to come off."</p>
      <p>It was in December 2018 when Shannon joined her brother to play video games on Xbox Live that she got chatting to his friend Ashley.</p>
      <p>The pair started talking every day on the gaming platform and just a few weeks later, they met in person and it was love at first sight.</p>
      <p>Ashley and Shannon officially started dating in January 2019, but after a few months of romance, disaster struck.</p>
      <p>Shannon was taken into hospital with a kidney infection in May 2019, but as the kidney treatment worked, she suddenly had extreme chest pain.</p>
      <p>Taken for a CT scan, doctors saw that Shannon's lungs were filling with blood, caused by three tumours inside her lungs.</p>

      <p>Doctors told Shannon that her cancer had returned and this time it was incurable.</p>
      <p>In July 2019, Shannon was devastated to hear that she had less than a year to live.</p>
      <p>Shannon said: "My whole world turned upside down. I was terrified as I know how hard it is to treat lung cancers.</p>
      <p>"They said I had anywhere from a few months to a year, but I'm still fighting after the few months so I am pleased to have made it to now."</p>
      <p>Since the wedding, Shannon and Ashley have happily settled into married life and are making the most of the short time they have together.</p>
      <p>Shannon is currently going through chemotherapy to extend her time with her new husband and the pair are focusing on enjoying every day.</p>
      <p>Shannon said: "I am happy for all the time I get with my husband, my family and my friends.</p>
      <p>"Ashley and I haven't really spoken about the future as we would rather forget that I'm going to die soon and think about it when I get to that stage.</p>
      <p>"It is difficult for Ashley but he understands and is grateful for all the time we do get together.</p>
      <p>"He told me that he is terrified that every morning he wakes up, I could have gone in the night.</p>
      <p>"I've come to terms with it now - whatever happens, happens. I can't choose how long I can live for, I'm just grateful for the time I do get."</p>
      <p>Ashley said: "I'm not gonna try and hide from the fact that I will lose her to something that I have no control over.</p>
      <p>"It's the hardest thing I have to face in my life and every time I think about it, I almost cry.</p>
      <p>"In all honesty, I am trying to make the best memories I can with Shannon. I want to make her dreams come true."</p>
