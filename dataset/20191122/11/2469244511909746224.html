      <h1>Referee mistake means Devon football match has to be replayed</h1>
      <h2>'What a shambles. We won the game fair and square so I don’t see why we should have to replay it.'</h2>

      <p>A football cup match is having to be replayed after the referee accidentally allowed the teams to play extra time when they should have gone to a penalty shootout.</p>
      <p>Devon &amp; Exeter League Division One clubs Exwick Villa and Bow AAC were locked at 0-0 after 90 minutes in their Devon Senior Cup third round clash in Exeter on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Exwick Sports Hub is equipped with floodlights, so the two sides were able to play extra time - with Bow scoring twice to seemingly win the tie 2-0 and progress to the next round.</p>
      <p>However, it has since come to light that Devon Senior Cup rules say games should go straight to penalties if level after 90 minutes - a rule change which only came into force over the summer.</p>
      <p>And in a further bizarre twist, the two sides are scheduled to play each other this weekend in a league clash, but that has now been shelved and the cup clash will likely be replayed at Bow.</p>
      <p>That was before a <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/met-office-hour-hour-forecast-3565496">yellow weather warning for rain</a> was issued over Devon, leaving that match hanging in the balance.</p>
      <p>Bow manager Doug Coles is not impressed.</p>
      <p>"What a shambles," he said. "We won the game fair and square so I don’t see why we should have to replay it.</p>
      <p>"The FA are saying there should be a replay though as it was not finished in a proper manner.</p>
      <p>"I have had about 10 emails from the league. At the moment it is to be played at our place at 2.15pm. They have changed the ref as well.</p>
      <p>"The problem is the league game has been put back. Bad weather means one or two will be put back to and you get tot he end of the season and you have loads of midweek games, which is tough on a small club like us."</p>
      <p>Exwick Villa secretary Adam Jason-Ryan disagreed.</p>
      <p>He said it was only fair to replay the tie as the referee had ordered them to play extra time, which should have not been the case.</p>
      <p>"I think there was a bit of miscommunication around the rules," he said. "We have lost the game but have appealed that now. I have had to send in a report. It has cost us more money - £25 - to protest it but hopefully they can rearrange it.</p>
      <p>"It should happen because the ref has been sent there by the Devon FA and he got it wrong. It is the ref managing the game so yes, it should be replayed.</p>
      <p>"Bow haven’t done anything wrong and it is not their fault, but it isn't ours either.</p>
      <p>"I think someone did not cross-check the rules and I guess neither of the managers knew them."</p>
      <p>Normally, a game replayed in these circumstances would see it take place at the original ground - in this case, Exwick Villa's.</p>
      <p>But with Villa's Devon League North East team scheduled for a home clash with St Martins, it means the replay looks like it is heading for Bow instead.</p>
      <p>Devon FA chief executive Paul Morrison admitted the situation was 'unfortunate', but said mistakes do happen.</p>
      <p>"It is unfortunate but these things do happen," he said. "It is the first this season but probably not the last as the rules were only changed over the summer.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately the referee was incorrect. He allowed extra time to take place when that is against competition rules and when that happens, the game has to be rescheduled.</p>
      <p>"If the game is replayed it is normally where it started from, but because Exwick’s senior team at a higher level are scheduled to play there, we made the decision to play at Bow.</p>
      <p>"That is the state of play. We are awaiting confirmation from Bow but it looks like it will be this saturday."</p>
