      <p>Horrifying dashcam footage captures the moment a child was almost ran over by a car after tumbling out of a moving taxi.</p>
      <p>The shocking scene shows a toddler left lying in the middle of a busy road in Coventry before being picked up by a woman.</p>
      <p>The potentially life-threatening incident took place on November 6 around 3.15pm when the driver behind the taxi, Kris McGrory, 38, had just finished a school run, <b><a href="https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/watch-shocking-moment-child-falls-17273843">reports CoventryLive.</a></b></p>
      <p>The dad-of-four said he had to break suddenly while turning a corner to avoid potentially hitting the child that was sprawled out helplessly in the middle of the road.</p>

      <p>A women - who is thought to be the child's mother - exited the taxi and lifted up her arms in an attempt to warn other drivers.</p>
      <p>Before heading back into the Uber taxi, she picks the boy up off the tarmac and hold him in her arms.</p>
      <p>The vehicle is then seen driving off along Butts and Gordon Street, in Earlsdon.</p>
      <p>Kris, who lives nearby the area, told CoventryLive: "I was behind the car for a minute or two beforehand and as the taxi went round the corner the door came open and the child rolled out.</p>

      <p>"The taxi driver stopped and a few seconds afterwards, which seemed a long time in that kind of situation, the woman came out.</p>
      <p>"You can't see it on the dashcam, but I could see how worried she was.</p>
      <p>"She saw my car coming and was saying 'slow down, slow down' as she was thinking her child was going to be squashed.</p>

      <p>"She then scooped them up and put them back in the taxi."</p>
      <p>The volunteer support worker also said that the taxi was driving normally during the time the boy fell out.</p>
      <p>He also said how such an incident highlights the need to be extra safe when it comes to travelling with children.</p>
      <p>"I don't know if it was just bad timing," He said "or the child was playing with the door handle, but it shows that we need to be safe."</p>
