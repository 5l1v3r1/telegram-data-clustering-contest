        <b>Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson has insisted she can still be Prime Minister despite a slide in recent polls for her party.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The East Dunbartonshire MP, who recently came under fire from the likes of Nicola Sturgeon and singer Amy McDonald over her stance on nuclear weapons, was speaking at a campaign event in Glasgow, where she stated that “not a single vote has been cast” in the election and that she was still in with a chance of leading the country.</p>
      <p>Since the early days of the campaign, Ms Swinson has said she is “running to be Prime Minister”.</p>
      <p>The latest Ipsos MORI poll shows support for Ms Swinson’s party has dropped by 4% between October and November, now standing at 16%.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson insisted it was still possible for her to walk into Downing Street after the December 12 election.</p>
      <p>She said: “Not a single vote has been cast. This is an election and people get to choose, so it’s absolutely possible.</p>
      <p>“People can choose better than Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn.”</p>
      <p>

          <i>Optimism</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The Lib Dem leader was optimistic about the campaign so far, saying: “I think we’re doing really well.</p>
      <p>“We’re out on doorsteps and seeing what’s happening in our seats across the country.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got lots of opportunities to get our message out.”</p>

      <p>When asked what she would class as a “good performance”, Ms Swinson said the party was looking to win as many contests as it can.</p>

      <p>She added: “There are seats where Liberal Democrats are in contention where we have never had a chance of winning before.</p>
      <p>“That’s partly because things have changed fundamentally because of Brexit.</p>
      <p>“There are so many people who are worried about our future.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Under fire</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ms Swinson faced criticism this week after she said she would be content to launch a nuclear strike if she was Prime Minister and it was required of her.</p>
      <p>Following the Lib Dem leader’s answering of the nuclear question, Nicola Sturgeon described the use of deterrent as “immoral, ineffective and a waste of money”.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Glasgow, Ms Swinson stood by her answer, suggesting a deterrent can only be effective if there is a chance it will be used.</p>
      <p>She said: “The Liberal Democrats support a nuclear deterrent and we support multilateral disarmament.</p>
      <p>“I answered the question honestly and clearly and I think that if a deterrent is effective, then that has to be the situation.”</p>
