      <p>Brokerage firm Emkay said that the CSB Bank is going for the IPO mainly to meet the RBI's requirement of listing the bank. The Reserve Bank of India has directed the lender to list its shares on domestic exchanges after Prem Watsa's Fairfax India Holdings Corporation acquired 51 per cent stake in the bank for around Rs 440 crore. The bank's capital position has been strengthened post FIHM's investment in the bank.</p>
