      <h3>And it'll work half as well as you'd like.</h3>
      <p><i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/world-of-warships-legends/">World of Warships Legends</a></i> cross-play will soon be offered across Xbox One and PS4, marking the first time the feature will be possible in a Wargaming title.</p>
      <p>While that’s good news, it comes with a caveat: cross-play will only work in matchmaker, with Wargaming advising that “players cannot interact between the consoles in regards to voice-chat or playing with friends on a different console.”</p>
      <p>“Making sure that our players have the best experience possible is our biggest goal, so I’m excited that both sets of fans will be able to enjoy <i>World of Warships: Legends</i> together,” states Victor Kislyi, Wargaming CEO. “This is just the first step in our cross-play efforts; it’s definitely something we want to build on in the future.”</p>
      <p>Cross-play in <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/world-of-warships-legends/"><i>World of Warships Legends </i></a>will be enabled on 25 November. The game is free-to-play on both cross-play platforms, Xbox One and PS4, and is also offered on Windows PC.</p>
