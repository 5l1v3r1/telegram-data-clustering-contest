      <h1>Ebonyi seals buildings located on designated recreation areas</h1>

      <p>The Ebonyi State government says it has sealed off some buildings in Abakaliki built on areas designated as parks and recreational centres in the city’s master plan.</p>
      <p>Mr Emmanuel Igwe, Special Assistant (SA) to the State Governor on Parks Development, disclosed this in an interview with <i>News Agency of Nigeria</i>, adding that such buildings defaced the city’s environment.</p>
      <p>Igwe said that in town planning, certain areas were designated as parks and recreational centres where people could relax, but some individuals contravened such building codes.</p>
      <p>“We applied to evict the occupants of such buildings. Not only evicting them, but they will also pay rents to the government.</p>
      <p>“That is why we are telling them to relocate on their own because if they don’t, we will pull down their buildings at their own cost.</p>
      <p>“They will not only pay rents for the number of years in question but they will also pay for the cost of the demolition of the buildings,” he said.</p>
      <p>The governor’s aide acknowledged that some ‘criminal’ elements must have sold the lands to the affected persons.</p>
      <p>He said such persons should have made necessary checks on such lands especially at the state ministry of lands.</p>
      <p>“We will in addition to getting those who built the houses also get those who sold the lands to them.</p>
      <p>“The state government will not pay compensation to them but they will instead, pay fines to the government for defacing the environment,” he said.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the development, Mr Moses Oshibe, state Commissioner for Lands and Survey, told <i>NAN</i> that he had yet to receive full details of the sealing off of the said buildings.</p>
      <p>“I have asked Igwe (the SA) to bring me his source of information in order to commence my investigation and I have already alerted the state Surveyor General on the issue.</p>
      <p>“I will brief you properly after the investigations which will be conducted swiftly because of the fate of the sealed-off buildings,” he said.</p>
      <p>The commissioner said that there were laws guiding building activities in the state, saying after his investigations the relevant laws would be applied on the issue.</p>
      <p>“The relevant decisions will not be taken by just me or the ministry but by the state government, headed by the governor whom I am answerable to.</p>
      <p>“I have repeatedly advised, even in the media, that individuals should make the necessary verification from the ministry before purchasing lands or other property.</p>
      <p>“They should come to the ministry for us to verify, check the relevant titles to see whether the lands they want to purchase are free or encumbered</p>
      <p>“We are always available for assistance and if the land is not free, we will advise the buyer not to buy in order not to waste his money,” he said.</p>
      <p>One of the owners of the affected buildings who spoke under the condition of anonymity said that he was making the necessary consultations before deciding on the action to take.</p>
      <p>“My building was sealed off at Nna street in Abakaliki but the people I contacted advised me to tarry to see if it can be resolved amicably,” he said.</p>
