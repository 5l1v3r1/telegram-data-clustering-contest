      <p>Welcome to your essential guide to the best Black Friday deals around. Black Friday is one of the biggest retail events of the year but while it used to be just one day long (it’s officially November 29), it now lasts for a few weeks, and that means the amount of deals that are unveiled can be quite overwhelming.</p>
      <p>That’s where we step in. We have teamed up with <a href="https://www.shortlist.com/">Shortlist.com</a> (part of the DC Thomson family) and have found the 20 best deals that you need to know about.</p>
      <p>These have been hand-picked by the team, who have combed through thousands of deals to arrive at this specially curated list. If you don’t find the bargain you are looking for, then head to Shortlist’s <a href="https://www.shortlist.com/news/best-black-friday-deals-update-401334">best Black Friday deals</a> page, where there are hundreds more discounts on offer.</p>

      <p>This is a fantastic deal. It was only in September that Amazon announced a slew of new Echo devices and the one that caught our eye was the all-new Echo Dot. It comes with an LED clock, so it’s perfect for your bedside table, making this one of the smartest smart speakers around. At this price you can’t go wrong.</p>

      <p>Now is the time to get a smart doorbell. Amazon owns Ring, which means that it can offer up a hefty discount and add an Echo Dot into the mix, too. There is a cool £109 off the price of this package, which is pretty much half-price. The smart doorbell works great with Amazon Alexa.</p>

      <p>The Fitbit Versa is exactly what you want in a smartwatch – it offers a number of brilliant features, including a battery life that lasts four days, 24/7 heart rate tracking, GPS via your phone, NFC payments and the ability to store around 3000 songs on the device. With over a third off right now, this is a great, cheap way into the world of wearables.</p>

      <p>In our recent mid-range phone test, the Google Pixel A came out as Best Overall. That was when it was full price. Now that it has a huge £70 off, this is a must-have. It packs most of the same features as the Google Pixel 3, but in a slightly cheaper chassis. That means that you get the brilliant camera functionality its bigger brother is famed for.</p>

      <p>If you still aren’t a Kindle convert, then this deal should convince you. The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite is the best e-reader around. It’s all thanks to Amazon’s ingenious technology that makes it feel like you are reading real paper. But there are extra benefits that rise it above a plain-old book – it’s packed with enough memory to hold thousands of books and the screen lights up, so is perfect for reading in bed with the lights out.</p>

      <p>You get not one, but two fantastic electric toothbrushes in this pack. Boots is quoting a huge £325 off, which means this deal is bound to sell out soon. If you and your other half fancy having some of the best electric toothbrushes around, then this is for you. Each toothbrush will last two weeks on a single charge and comes with six brushing options.</p>

      <p>There are a number of discounts on Emma mattresses available through John Lewis, but this is the best we have seen. It’s the cheapest-ever price for a single Emma mattress. This is one brand that consistently wins awards because of the quality of their stock – this particular one is made from memory foam and is supplied rolled, in a space-saving box.</p>

      <p>KitchenAid Artisan Stand Mixer is one of the most lusted-after mixers around. Yes, it’s on the pricey side but this is softened thanks to a £220 discount. For the money, you get a mixer that can handle 4.83 litres of produce and has a very powerful 300 watts of mixing power. It also looks stunning – with a variety of colours available.</p>

      <p>Some are scared off by the idea of making their home smart, but it’s never been easier thanks to the likes of Philips Hue. These smart lights are worth every discounted penny. For almost half the RRP, you get a kit that includes three bulbs and the bridge that makes it work with your Wi-Fi setup. Once installed, you will be able to ask Alexa or Google to turn your lights on and off – something that never grows old.</p>

There’s almost £15 off of this single malt, which will satisfy those looking for a hint of vanilla and a bit of smoke in their whisky.</p>

      <p>A relative newcomer in the gin world, this is a lovely tipple that comes in one of the best bottles we have seen. It’s rare to see this gin drop below the £30 mark, so we think this is one alcohol deal that will sell out soon. Taste wise, it’s packed with citrus and comes with a hint of spice.</p>

      <p>B&amp;O is one of the best premium tech manufacturers around. Given they are a premium brand, it’s usually worth waiting for something like Black Friday to come around so you can afford the kit. This is an amazing deal on one of the best-looking, best-sounding over-ear headphones you will find. If you’ve yet to go for noise cancelling, then these are for you.</p>

      <p>Le Creuset is always a brand that offers great-looking homeware and we have fallen in love with this rainbow mug set. At a snip under £60 that makes it just £10 per mug. When it comes to colours, they are officially called: cerise, volcanic, Dijon yellow, kiwi, cassis and teal. Pretentious, yes, but they look lovely and are made from high quality stoneware.</p>
