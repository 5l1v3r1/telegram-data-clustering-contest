        <b>The price reduction will come into effect from January 2020</b>
      </p>
      <p>A huge announcement has been made by Lidl in relation to price reductions for a whopping 500 products across all stores.</p>
      <p>The price reductions will take effect from January 2020 thanks to the opening of a new €100m distribution centre in Newbridge, Co Kildare.</p>
      <p>The state-of-the-art facility, which represents the single largest investment by Lidl in Ireland since 2000, creates 100 new full-time positions.</p>
      <p>The new jobs add to the existing 250 people that Lidl already employ in the region.</p>
      <p>The news follows a price reduction on over 250 products in the past six months across Lidl stores.</p>
      <p>The new distribution centre’s increased capacity means it can store 49 million products through the streamlining of operations.</p>
      <p>The distribution centre has the capacity to serve Lidl’s network of 90 stores in the Leinster area.</p>
      <p>J.P. Scally, Managing Director of Lidl said:</p>
      <p>“First and foremost, this new distribution centre is good news for our customers. By increasing our storage capacity and streamlining our supply chains we will achieve even higher levels of efficiencies and in turn deliver considerable savings to shoppers across the country.</p>
      <p>"That means lower prices on the same quality produce, and more money back in our customers’ pockets.</p>
      <p>“It is important for us that we ensure our build is future-proofed and that we are expanding sustainably. By investing at the scale that we have, we’ve ensured that we have the ability to supply Ireland’s growing population efficiently and consistently, long into the future.”</p>
