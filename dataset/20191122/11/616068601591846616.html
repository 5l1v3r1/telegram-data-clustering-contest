      <p>Despite the opening of a low-income apartment complex that got some 50 people off the street, the number of homeless in the city has changed little from last year.</p>
      <p>According to a report that will be presented to Vernon City Council Monday, in 2018 the annual homeless count found 161 people living rough in Vernon.</p>
      <p>The My Place apartment complex opened 52 units in the summer housing close to 60 people, but the fall homeless count found there were still 151 people living on the streets.</p>
      <p>The annual count was conducted Oct. 16 and the full report on the results will be presented to Vernon city council at their regular council meeting Nov. 25.</p>
      <p>Annette Sharkey, with the Social Planning Council, said the “scope of homelessness is bigger than the point-in-time count. The point-in-time count lets us know on any given night how many people are we trying to house or bring inside, so that stayed at about 150.</p>
      <p>“But really, if you look at the number of people who have accessed the Gateway Shelter over the last year we are up more in the 300 to 400.”<br/>Sharkey said there are always people moving in and out of the community on an annual basis and the survey found most of the people coming to Vernon had some sort of connection to the community.</p>
      <p>While some people may be moving to Vernon from smaller communities for the amenities being offered here, Sharkey said the majority of new faces came here from communities that did have services in place.</p>
      <p>“To say that we should stop building services and people will stop coming is simply not correct. It won't reduce our numbers,” said Sharkey. “Homelessness across the province is not going away and we continue to feel the pressure.”</p>
      <p>The report said “moving to Vernon to access services is not the most common reason. 60 per cent of people surveyed indicated that they had grown up in Vernon or had family connections. Reconnecting with family members was the most common response when asked why they moved to Vernon.”</p>
      <p>Last month, Geoff Gaucher, manager of protective services for Vernon, said bylaw officers were seeing five to 10 homeless people a week coming to town.</p>
      <p>“What we normally see in the fall is a lowering of the people living on the streets. Lots of street entrenched and homeless folk camp in various places in our community in the summer months, and in the winter we see those numbers lower with some folks going inside, they are going to shelters, they are getting accommodation,” said Gaucher in October. “But starting in mid September we have started to see five to 10 people a week, new faces in town which is not normal.”</p>
      <p>Of all the files City of Vernon bylaw compliance staff dealt with between Jan. 1 and Aug. 22 2019, 1,859 files had to do with the street-entrenched population.</p>
      <p>That is 46 per cent of the department's total calls for that time period.</p>
      <p>During the same period in 2018, there were 1,598 files related to the street-entrenched population, also making up 46 per cent of the total number of calls.</p>
