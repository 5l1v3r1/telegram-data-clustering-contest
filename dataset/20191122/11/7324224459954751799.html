      <p>An obsessed man has been found guilty of shooting his heavily pregnant ex-wife dead with a crossbow.</p>
      <p>Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo, 51, burst into the home of mother-of-five Devi Muhammad, formerly known as Unmathallegadoo, and fired an arrow into her stomach as she fled upstairs.</p>
      <p>Mrs Muhammad, 35, suffered catastrophic internal injuries and died while her unborn son was delivered by Caesarean section and miraculously survived.</p>
      <p>The defendant showed no emotion in the dock as he was found guilty by the retrial jury after four hours of deliberations.</p>

      <p>Judge Mark Lucraft QC remanded him in custody to be sentenced on November 29.</p>
      <p>The judge told him: “You have been convicted of the most horrendous crime in the face of your own children and it’s extremely grave what you have carried out.”</p>
      <p>The defendant nodded and thanked the judge as he was send down.</p>
      <p>A further charge of attempted child destruction, not put to the fresh jury, is expected to lie on file.</p>
      <p>The court had heard how the victim had an arranged marriage to the defendant in Mauritius on her 16th birthday. He was 30 at the time, nearly twice her age.</p>
      <p>Their unhappy relationship ended in 2012 after an incident in which she jumped out of an upstairs window and broke her ankle.</p>
      <p>After a trial in 2013, he was cleared of attacking her and acquitted on the judge’s direction of a charge of attempted strangulation under the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861.</p>
      <p>The victim successfully filed for an emergency non-molestation order which barred the defendant from coming within 100 metres of the family home in Ilford, east London.</p>

      <p>Under the order, which was still in place at the time of the killing, Unmathallegadoo was forbidden from contacting his ex-wife directly and was not to threaten or intimidate her or their three children.</p>
      <p>Following her divorce, she married builder Imtiaz Muhammad and changed her name to Sana Muhammad.</p>
      <p>The couple went on to have two children together and were eagerly awaiting the imminent arrival of their third last autumn.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the defendant lost his job as a site manager at Newham General Hospital and slept rough as he plotted revenge.</p>
      <p>He bought two crossbows online for around £250 each – an MK-XB 55 Package Red Dot and a Hori-Zone Alfa XT – which were discovered stashed near his ex-wife’s home by a neighbour in March 2018.</p>
      <p>After they were removed, Unmathallegadoo set about replacing them, and organised surveillance on the house in Applegarth Drive.</p>
      <p>On the morning of November 12 2018, he took up position in the garden shed armed with two crossbows, bolts, a knife, duct tape, cable ties and a hammer.</p>
      <p>He was disturbed by Mr Muhammad who had gone into the garden to store an empty box while his wife prepared food for a dinner party that evening.</p>

      <p>Mr Muhammad called for his wife to run as he was chased into the house, the court was told.</p>
      <p>As Unmathallegadoo’s oldest children rushed in to disarm him, the defendant said: “It would have been easier if you guys weren’t here, like I would have done it.”</p>
      <p>Afterwards, he told police he was aiming for Mr Muhammad but his former spouse got in the way.</p>
      <p>Giving evidence, he claimed the crossbow went off by accident and he bought the weapons to go hunting in Mauritius with his brother.</p>
      <p>He told jurors he only wanted to confront Mr Muhammad about his concerns that his daughter was being brought up a Muslim.</p>
      <p>But the prosecution argued Unmathallegadoo’s plan had been to restrain the family and at least kill the two adults and the unborn child.</p>
      <p>The jury in Unmathallegadoo’s first trial was discharged after a juror raised an issue of psychiatric illness against the judge’s direction not to speculate and despite no evidence being heard about his mental state.</p>
