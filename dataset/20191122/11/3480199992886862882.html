      <p>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says Joe Gomez is “better than good” after his altercation with Raheem Sterling earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Manchester City forward Sterling initially clashed with Reds defender Gomez towards the end of the Premier League match between the sides on November 10 at Anfield.</p>
      <p>The pair were then involved in a fracas the following day on England duty after meeting up at St George’s Park, with Sterling later apologising at a team meeting and on social media.</p>

      <p>Sterling subsequently sat out England’s Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro as punishment but returned to the starting line-up in the 4-0 victory over Kosovo on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Klopp insists Gomez, who was left with a scratch on his face following the clash, has not been affected by the incident and the German has no issues with how the situation was handled.</p>
      <p>“He is good, better than good,” said Klopp. “The people involved were fine pretty quick. Things like this happen in football. Absolutely nothing to say about it.</p>
      <p>“The FA dealt with it how they saw right and I cannot judge that as I was not aware of the circumstances.”</p>

      <p>Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola said Sterling described Gomez as “an excellent guy” and also suggested the incident would have little impact on the in-form forward.</p>
      <p>Guardiola said: “We are good. I spoke with him and he’s fine. He says Joe is an excellent guy and they have a good relationship.”</p>
      <p>Asked whether the situation might have been made worse by the short turnaround between the game and the international get-together, Guardiola added: “I don’t think so.”</p>
