      <h1>Feeling fitter and scoring goals, David Templeton is enjoying life with Brewers</h1>
      <h2>Scottish winger is like a super-sub in reverse for Albion, starting, making an impact, then coming off</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:03:03+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:03</time> by <a rel="author">Colston Crawford</a></address>
      <p>One of these days, David Templeton is going to walk off the pitch at the end of a game with the rest of his Burton Albion team-mates, with a full 90 minutes under his belt.</p>
      <p>The 75 minutes Templeton played in Tuesday night’s 4-1 win over Salford City in the FA Cup first round replay was the longest he has managed yet this season – but it was a toss up between him and Stephen Quinn for man of the match honours.</p>
      <p>It is unlikely that anyone is going to mind if Templeton does not complete 90 minutes all season, though, if he continues to have the sort of impact he is having while he is involved in the action.</p>
      <p>He is, you could say, a super-sub in reverse. This one starts the game and chucks in everything he has, with a view to being replaced at some point in the second half.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the season, Templeton was the one coming off the bench but, these last few weeks, he has been starting, since scoring the only goal in the 1-0 win over AFC Wimbledon in October.</p>
      <p>He has now started five matches this season and scored four times, the only time he missed out being the 1-1 draw away to Salford in the Cup. He was still the Brewers’ liveliest attacker that day.</p>
      <p>Boss Nigel Clough manages Templeton’s game time carefully, knowing the player’s injury history. He will understand the situation well enough, as a man whose own full-time career was cut short by injury before he embarked on 300 matches as player-manager at Burton.</p>
      <p>In each of the previous two matches, Templeton had come off with a niggle, his ankle in the first game against Salford, then his knee against Mansfield Town in the Leasing.com Trophy.</p>

      <p>The second one worried Templeton more, because he spent almost two years on the sidelines with the same knee injured while with Rangers.</p>
      <p>“It’s frustrating. I’ve had three operations on that knee,” said Templeton after the Salford replay. “I took a whack on it. If it had been the other side, I think it would have been fine but it was the one I’ve had issues with. It swelled up.</p>
      <p>“It seems to have been the way my whole career’s gone but I just want to try to keep fit and playing now. I’m feeling better, being back playing, getting minutes, and the goals help breed confidence.”</p>
      <p>He has not been lucky. A shoulder injury - twice - has also hampered him during his 18 months with Burton.</p>
      <p>“I did it to start with against Southend, here, and it was innocuous,” he said. “And then it was Fleetwood away where a defender came down on top of me and re-did it. They were bizarre ones. “But I’m feeling good just now and just want to stay in the team.”</p>
      <p>It was evident that Templeton is feeling fitter against Salford, not only because of his attacking threat, which resulted in a fine goal to restore the Brewers’ lead, but in his willingness to chase back and defend. There was a sublime moment in the second half when he was trapped near his own corner flag and produced a trick to escape, before curling a pass down the line with the outside of his left foot.</p>
      <p>Templeton is terrific to watch in full flow and was asked what it is that gets defenders on edge against him.</p>
      <p>“If other teams are starting to watch what I’m doing now, I’ll do as I always do, which is try to mix my game up, so that defenders don’t know what I’m going to do all the time,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I’m comfortable with both feet. If I show to go inside (on to his right foot) I can always go back on to my left.</p>
      <p>“I think that makes it difficult for defenders, keeping them guessing. They can’t expect me to go inside all the time. If the space is there on the left, I’ll take it.”</p>
      <p>Everyone loves watching a tricky winger and perhaps Templeton was born to be one. His father, Henry, was and he gave his son the middle name Cooper, after Davie, the former Rangers and Scotland winger.</p>
      <p>Clough is simply happy to have got hold of a player of Templeton’s ability.</p>
      <p>“He’s fine, he just picks up niggles,” said Clough. “He’s 30 years old and he had a very serious injury a few years back. If he was 100% right and fit, we probably wouldn’t have got him 18 months ago. We brought him in for just the sort of things he’s done in the last few weeks but he’s done them pretty consistently over the last 18 months when he’s been fit.</p>
      <p>“I think he’s working harder and looking a bit fitter. The most important thing is making and scoring goals and he does that. He’s a very good player to have in your squad.”</p>
      <p><i><b>And here's what Templeton had to say after the Salford replay:</b> </i><br/>David Templeton says his brief from manager Nigel Clough is to give everything he can from the start in a game and not worry about running out of steam later.</p>
      <p>The mercurial Scottish winger was a thorn in Salford City’s side for all of the 75 minutes he was on the pitch in Tuesday night’s FA Cup first round replay and he scored another memorable goal after 64 minutes to put Burton Albion back in front. It was a key moment as, having conceded an equaliser early in the second half, the Brewers went on to control the game and ran out 4-1 winners.</p>
      <p>Templeton looked to have it all to do when Scott Fraser’s pass picked him out on the left but he cut inside, making just that yard of space that wingers need to give them an option and, spotting a gap, bent a delightful shot across and wide of goalkeeper Chris Neal into the far bottom corner of the net. It was a sumptuous finish and the fourth goal the Scot has scored in five starts.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been getting into those sort of positions a lot, where I can get those type of shots away,” he said. “But I’ve had a few this season that have been a bit wild, a bit high, so I’m trying to make sure, if I get in that area, that I keep them down and at least make the keeper make a save and, thankfully, that one went in.</p>
      <p>“We had felt a bit hard done to with their goal. We thought it was a foul before it. But the way we reacted was good. We managed to get the goal to get back ahead and, after that, I think we controlled it.</p>
      <p>“I think it all shows the character of the boys. We didn’t expect to have the game, with a few players away, but that’s just the way we are, we work hard and keep trying to do the right things.”</p>
      <p>Templeton had come off in the previous match feeling a sore knee and, in the one before that, with an ankle niggle but has returned to start each time.</p>
      <p>He has yet to complete 90 minutes in a game this season but he is contributing, emphatically.</p>
      <p>“The gaffer always says when I’m playing just to give it everything I’ve got and if I get tired or feel any niggles, I can come off,” he said. “I just to try to do what I can in the time that I’m on, try to make stuff happen. It was nice to get more minutes and, hopefully, now, I can keep myself in.”</p>
      <p>Templeton was replaced by Lloyd Dyer with his job done and the pace of his veteran replacement would not have brought cheer to the Salford defence.</p>
      <p>“Thankfully, I managed to contribute and then Lloyd coming on, he’s an experienced head and a great player to have coming on,” added Templeton.</p>
