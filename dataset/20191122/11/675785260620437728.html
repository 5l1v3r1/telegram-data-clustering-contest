      <h2>Dan Osborne's life crumbled after the release of a sickening tape in which he was heard threatening to 'stick a knife in' the mother of his son</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:45:59+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:45</time> by <a rel="author">Louise Randell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/louise-randell/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jacqueline-jossa">Jacqueline Jossa</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dan-osborne">Dan Osborne</a> 's relationship was almost destroyed by a bombshell tape in which he threatened to "stick a knife in" his ex-girlfriend.</p>
      <p>The pair got together in 2013 after Dan left his partner, Megan Tomlin, when she was four months pregnant with their first baby.</p>
      <p>Megan later gave birth to a son named Teddy, and by 2014, Jacqueline was pregnant with Dan's next child, a daughter named Ella.</p>
      <p>However, Jac and Dan's romance almost came crashing down when tape recordings of Dan threatening to stab Megan were leaked.</p>
      <p>The shocking audio recordings had Dan telling Megan, "it won't be funny when you're in hospital" and calling her a "dirty little c***" and a "slag".</p>
      <p>He also threated to "stick a knife in" her if he found out she'd had sex with another man.</p>
      <p>When Megan pleaded that she'd not bedded anyone else, Dan raged back - telling her to "shut your f*****g mouth".</p>

      <p>He also referenced his budding romance with Jacqueline in the tape, calling it a "mistake" and insisting he wasn't still with her.</p>
      <p>It was this clanger that particularly stung the EastEnders star when she later listened to the recording.</p>
      <p>A police investigation into Dan's threats was launched, but was later dropped.</p>
      <p>The tape is believed to date from November 2014, around the same time Dan was arrested on suspicion of assault following a blazing row with Megan at her Essex home.</p>
      <p>He was released without charge.</p>
      <p>The fall out from the tape led to Dan being fired from his job on Towie, and prompted him to issue</p>
      <p>In a statement, Dan said: "It has taken me a while to find the right words but I would like to say that I am truly sorry to anyone who was offended by what they heard.</p>

      <p>"I am unable to talk about the difficulties with my current family situation but I am taking steps to resolve it to achieve the best outcome for my son.</p>
      <p>"I am ashamed and embarrassed that I allowed myself to reach such a dark place that I behaved in a way that even I didn’t recognise."</p>
      <p>In March 2015, months after the recording was leaked, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/megan-tomlin-reveals-full-extent-5430396">Megan branded Dan "controlling"</a> and said his behaviour had destroyed her self esteem.</p>
      <p>"If you haven't experienced it, it's hard to explain how much a person can get inside your mind and control how you feel," Megan said.</p>
      <p>"Of course, I was in love with Daniel and I was embarrassed to speak out about what was happening. I didn’t want other people to criticise him and part of me hoped he would change."</p>

      <p>She went on: "He tried to make me believe that the situation between us was my fault.</p>
      <p>"You can hear this on the tape, when Daniel tells me I've broken up the family, despite the fact he moved on when I was four months pregnant – causing a considerable amount of strain and stress during such a precious time – only to then return once our son was born and leave again when he was four months old."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/megan-tomlins-brother-blasts-delusional-5433273">Jacqueline leapt to Dan's defence after Megan's interview</a> , tweeting a long ode to her boyfriend.</p>
      <p>"People selling stories on him, show one side to a story, but people around Dan know the whole truth, and you would all be shocked," she wrote on March 31 2015.</p>
      <p>"I can assure you I wouldn't stand by a man capable of everything dan has been made out to be.</p>
      <p>"He is my best friend, boyfriend… and he is a brilliant father, above all else, I just want to clear up, he has never once been violent or even shown signs towards me at all."</p>

      <p>She added: "I am 100 per cent not saying what Daniel has said was right or okay</p>
      <p>"But people make mistakes when on dark places, and it's something that we sorted out privately not in front of the whole world.</p>
      <p>"It's something he has apologised for and is embarrassed about."</p>
      <p>Jacqueline also told OK! magazine that she thought Dan's threats were "disgusting" - and admitted she was really hurt when she heard him call their relationship "a mistake" on the recordings.</p>

        <figcaption>The couple have split several times and got back together</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"I listened to them and I was completely shocked by what I heard - I thought it was disgusting but it's something that we've worked through as a couple," she said.</p>
      <p>"Daniel has lost out on countless work opportunities because of it and he's had to deal with everyone passing judgement on him, so I think he's been punished enough."</p>
      <p>She added at the time: "It caused a lot of arguments between us but he explained that he was only saying what he thought he had to in order to see Teddy.</p>
      <p>"I don't think I'll ever forgive him for what he said but at least I understand his reasons why."</p>
      <p>They couple managed to get their relationship back on track after the bombshell tape, marrying in 2017 and welcoming a second daughter.</p>
      <p>However, the romance was later rocked by a series of scandals, including 2018 allegations linking him to reality stat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a> .</p>
      <p>Dan denied cheating on his wife after growing close to Gabby while they filmed a TV show in Spain.</p>
      <p>After getting back together again, the couple were rocked by more cheating allegations earlier this year when Dan was accused of snogging Love Island's Alexandra Cane on a night out in Manchester.</p>
      <p>Dan denied the claims and managed to patch up his relationship with Jacqueline once again.</p>
