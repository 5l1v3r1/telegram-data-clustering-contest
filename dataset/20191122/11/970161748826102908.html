      <h1>Who's going to pay for Beatrice and Eugenie after Prince Andrew was sacked?</h1>

      <p>Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie will continue to carry out a ‘limited number’ of royal duties despite their father being effectively sacked by the Queen.</p>
      <p>An edict was reportedly issued to ‘protect the Princesses’ as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> was forced to step down from representing The Firm.</p>
      <p>While they remain in the royal fold, questions have been raised about how the girls will continue to be funded as their father has long-subsidised their lifestyles.</p>
      <p>In particular, Beatrice is getting married next year and the event is unlikely to be as lavish as Eugenie’s 2018 marriage at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/windsor-castle/">Windsor Castle</a>.</p>

      <p>For now, the Princesses appear to be putting on a brave face about their father’s fate, whose downfall came because of his links to paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Beatrice has been spotted at a private members’ club while Eugenie was seen at a charity event.</p>
      <p>The pair will continue to take part in a few royal engagements such as Trooping The Colour and Christmas at Sandringham.</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace added that: ‘The Princesses do undertake a small number of royal engagements each year, as and when asked, and that will continue.’</p>

      </figure>
      <p>However it is far removed from Andrew’s dream of them playing a bigger role in the royal family.</p>
      <p>He continually noted they were the only ‘blood Princesses’ of their generation and pushed for them to play a bigger role.</p>
      <p>That continually put him at odds with older brother Prince Charles and his vision for a slimmed-down monarchy.</p>
      <p>Now that the Duke of York has stepped down for the foreseeable future, a royal source told the Daily Mail: ‘The promotion which Andrew had hoped for in terms of his daughters taking on more duties will now never happen.</p>
      <p>‘They will have to focus on the day job.’</p>

      <p>Eugenie, 29, has a role at the Hauser &amp; Wirth Art Gallery in Mayfair and can expect to be paid around £32,000 to £34,000.</p>

      <p>Beatrice, 31, is vice-president of partnerships and strategy at Afiniti, an American software company where she focuses on ‘client development.’</p>
      <p>Her salary is unknown.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Vogue, the Princesses described themselves as ‘working, young royal women.’</p>
      <p>But their salaries are highly unlikely to be able to pay for their lavish lifestyles.</p>

      <p>Beatrice lives in a taxpayer-funded apartment at St James’s Palace while Eugenie and husband Jack Brooksbank – a wine merchant and tequila brand ambassador – live in the grounds of Kensington Palace.</p>
      <p>The newlyweds pay a ‘commercial rate’ for the three-bed house close to cousin Prince William and family, which is said to be around £182,000 a year.</p>
      <p>It has always been assumed that Prince Andrew covers the cost of their accommodation and luxury holidays.</p>
      <p>The Prince receives £249,000 a year annually from the Queen to cover his private office but has also financially benefited from commercial deals over the years.</p>
      <p>They are likely to now dry up as people distance themselves in the wake of the scandal over the late financier Epstein.</p>

      <p>The Princesses visit their grandmother the Queen regularly at Windsor Castle and she is said to be very attached to them.</p>
      <p>A Palace source told the Mail: ‘There was a sense of everyone circling the wagons around the girls.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘There is a feeling that they must not be made to pay for the sins of the father.</p>
      <p>‘The Queen is particularly fond of Beatrice and Eugenie and respects the way that Andrew and Sarah have brought them up.</p>
      <p>‘Even though you may feel that they have made such a mess of their own lives, they have been loving co-parents.</p>
      <p>‘The Queen will continue to invite Beatrice and Eugenie to Balmoral over the summer and she sees quite a lot of them at Windsor.</p>
      <p>‘They, in turn, are fond of “Super Gran” as they call her.</p>
      <p>‘The feeling is that everyone wants to protect them from this hurt and from further hurt, rather than dance on their father’s grave.’</p>

      <p>Eugenie’s wedding in October 2018 had a guest list of 800, an open carriage ride through Windsor and a £2 million bill to the taxpayer for security.</p>
      <p>Beatrice is set to marry property tycoon Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, 35, but it is unlikely to be such a grand affair.</p>
      <p>St George’s Chapel in Windsor is one contender as is York Minster, in nod to her father’s title, or even abroad.</p>
