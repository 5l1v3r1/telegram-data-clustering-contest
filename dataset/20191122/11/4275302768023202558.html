      <p>Lady Dorian is expected to preside over the Salmond prosecution.</p>
      <p>As Lord Justice Clerk, she is the first woman in 692 years to be appointed as Scotland’s second most senior judge.</p>
      <p>She is the first woman to be appointed to the judicial position in more than six centuries. The first Lord Justice Clerk – William de Camera – was appointed to the post in 1324 during the reign of King David II.</p>
      <p>Lady Dorrian was born Leeona Dorrian in June 1957 in Edinburgh. She attended Cranley Girls’ School in the city and studied for a law degree at Aberdeen University.</p>
      <p>She was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1981 and became Queen’s Counsel in 1994.</p>
      <p>Lady Dorrian became a full-time High Court judge in 2005. She was appointed to the bench after Mr Salmond’s predecessor as first minister Jack McConnell recommended her to the Queen.</p>
      <p>Lady Dorrian was one of the three appeal judges who cut the punishment part of Aaron Campbell’s sentence by three years to 24 years from 27.</p>
      <p>Campbell, 17, was convicted of abducting, raping and murdering Alesha MacPhail in March 2019 at the High Court in Glasgow.</p>
