      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/shakhtar-donetsk">Shakhtar Donetsk</a> captain <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/taison">Taison</a> has been banned for one match after he was sent off for reacting to alleged racism.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the Brazil international made an offensive gesture towards <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Dynamo_Kiev">Dynamo Kiev</a> fans and then kicked the ball into their section of the stand before the referee led all the players off in the 77th minute.</p>
      <p>Video footage shows Taison and Brazilian team-mate <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/dentinho">Dentinho</a> leaving the pitch in tears after both had seemingly been targeted, while they were consoled by several Dynamo players.</p>
      <p>Taison was shown the red card by the referee immediately after the match – played at Shakhtar’s temporary home at the OSK Metalist stadium in Kharkiv – had resumed.</p>
      <p>“We are very disappointed by the decision of the Ukrainian FA to hand Taison a one-match ban,” said world players’ union <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/fifpro">Fifpro</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“Sanctioning a victim of racial abuse is beyond comprehension and it plays into the hands of those who promote this kind of disgraceful behaviour.”</p>
      <p>The Ukrainian Association of Football fined Dynamo Kiev £16,000 and ordered them to play one match behind closed doors. The club will also be on probation for the remainder of the season.</p>
