        <figcaption><b>General Election 2019</b> : Opinion polls over the last seven days</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Plaid Cymru is promising to make St David's Day a bank holiday, keep Wales as a member of the EU and to pay people to cycle to work.</p>
      <p>Their <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election 2019</a> manifesto is 45 pages long and called "Wales, it's us".</p>
      <p>There are five key policies; a green jobs revolution, caring for everyone, a fair deal for families, action on housing and combating crime.</p>
      <p>The party has entered a pact with other remain parties the Green Party and Lib Dems <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/plaid-lib-dems-greens-wont-17215204">not to stand in every seat.</a></p>
      <p>Plaid Cymru wants Wales to be an independent member of the European Union by 2030.</p>
      <p>To do that, it admits it needs to be in power at the Welsh Government after the 2021 Senedd election.</p>
      <p>"The greatest obstacle to Welsh independence is the charge that we simply cannot afford it, that a country as rich as Wales in natural resources and in the skills and imagination of her people, is somehow too poor to be independent," it says.</p>
      <p>"Fundamentally, the reason why there is such a large gap between the taxes we raise in Wales, and the money we spend on benefits and public services, is the way our economy has been mismanaged by successive centralised London governments.</p>
      <p>"We need independence precisely in order to change that."</p>
      <p>
        <b>On Brexit</b>
      </p>
      <p>Plaid Cymru promise a people's vote and to campaign for remain.</p>
      <p>It dedicates eight A5 pages to explaining why Brexit and a no-deal Brexit are bad for Wales and what the four MPs it had in the last Parliament did to prevent it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plaid Cymru will seek the devolution of migration policy so that Wales can set its own migration quota</li>
        <li>It would change the Settled Status application system into a registration system, ensuring that all EU citizens who are resident in the UK before exit day should have the right of permanent residence</li>
        <li>The party says it would "ensure that all the national parliaments of the UK are consulted throughout the negotiations on future trade deals"</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Green jobs</h3>
      <p>In the document Plaid demands that the UK Government allocate an additional 1% of GDP per year to capital investment over the next ten years.</p>
      <p>That would give them £15bn to invest in a "Welsh Green Jobs Revolution".</p>
      <p>The party wants the Treasury to allow the Welsh Government to borrow up to £5 billion for capital investment.</p>
      <p>"These sums will allow us to create tens of thousands highly skilled green collar jobs, allowing Wales to be a trailblazer in the fight to tackle the climate emergency."</p>
      <p>Proposed projects include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A publicly owned Welsh broadband guarantee for every home and business in Wales by 2025</li>
        <li>Electrification of all major rail lines by 2030</li>
        <li>Building a super-Metro for south-east Wales with new stations</li>
        <li>Building the new Swansea Bay and Western Valleys Metro</li>
        <li>Reopening rail services for the Amman, Swansea, Neath and Dulais Valleys</li>
        <li>Developing a metro for north-east Wales and relocate the Chester Transport for Wales Depot to the north of Wales</li>
        <li>Creating a trans-Wales railway</li>
        <li>Expanding the Traws Cymru bus network</li>
        <li>Tidal Lagoons for Swansea Bay, Cardiff and Colwyn Bay</li>
        <li>Building an Ynys Môn offshore windfarm and an Usk barrage</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The party promises 20,000 green social homes and a £5bn programme to improve the energy efficiency of housing in Wales and reduce fuel poverty.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Health and caring</b>
      </p>
      <p>The manifesto promises free Social Care at the point of need, delivered by a new and seamless National Health and Social Care Service.</p>
      <p>"We estimate this will cost the Welsh Government an extra £300 million a year, which in the context of an overall Welsh budget of £17 billion, is an achievable priority".</p>
      <p>On pensions, it backs the 1950s women and calls by the UK Mineworkers Pension Association to get the 50-50 split of pension surplus renegotiated. We will continue to demand a fairer deal for former miners to access money.</p>
      <p>It will protect the triple-lock on <b>state pensions</b> and require the BBC to reverse the cuts to <b>free TV licences.</b></p>
      <p>It would <b>train and recruit</b> an additional 1,000 doctors, 5,000 nurses, and 100 dentists for the Welsh NHS.</p>
      <p>Plaid opposed the privatisation of the health service.</p>
      <p>It would up mental health spending by 5% and promises "cancer pathways that enable speedier treatment".</p>
      <p>It will establish an independent, publicly funded National Institute for Public Health policy to advise on public health matters without being influenced by vested interests.</p>
      <p>Planning laws would be changed to provide greater protection for green spaces in urban areas and would increase spending on active travel routes and promote walking and cycling.</p>
      <p>It wants a National Commission on reforming <b>drug law.</b></p>
      <h3>For families</h3>
      <p>Plaid Cymru's plan to end family poverty will include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A £35 a week payment for every child in low income families, lifting 50,000 children in Wales out of poverty</li>
        <li>Free Care and Education for all 1-3 year olds via free full-day early years childcare and early years education to all children between one and three-years-old</li>
        <li>Early years into school will be the "first stage of education to ensure that all Welsh children become bilingual"</li>
        <li>Statutory targets for reducing child poverty</li>
        <li>Plaid Cymru will provide an extra £300million a year for our schools and colleges</li>
        <li>It will undertake a review of the funding offer for Welsh domiciled undergraduate and post-graduate students, in respect of both tuition fees and living costs and Iincrease funding for degree apprentices in Wales</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Housing</h3>
      <p>"We will create a Welsh-based Planning Inspectorate that is required to meet the needs of our communities" and will "reform the Local Development Plan system to ensure that development is far more collaborative, involving communities at a far earlier stage in the process than at present."</p>
      <p>On homelessness, it backs a plan by charity Crisis which, if implemented would end homelessness and bring overall savings to UK public services of around £34.6 billion by 2041. In Wales it would entail savings of about £70 million a year.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Crime</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plaid Cymru will recruit an extra 1,600 police officers – two for each community</li>
        <li>It will "reverse the harsh cuts so that people who are currently unable to access legal aid can exercise their right to justice"</li>
        <li>Prisoners should be placed as close to their local communities as possible, it says</li>
        <li>On knife crime, it says it will "work with youth clubs, sports governing bodies, schools, community groups, voluntary organisations and youth workers to improve youth services and to increase the availability of both formal and informal activities"</li>
        <li>Sexual Assault Referral Centres' will be "properly funded" and a promise to ensure counselling services are available</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Devolution</h3>
      <p>Plaid wants further devolution and to "press for the devolution of financial powers to the Senedd, plus the transfer of justice, economic development, welfare and culture powers that are currently reserved to Westminster".</p>
      <p>"We need greater financial powers to enable the Welsh Government to tailor taxation and funding to meet the needs of Wales. These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Devolution of corporation tax as i in Northern Ireland</li>
        <li>Devolution of Air Passenger Duty as in Scotland and Northern Ireland</li>
        <li>VAT revenues assigned to Wales as in Scotland</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Finance and tax</h3>
      <p>Plaid wants the Barnett formula to be reworked and says "everybody should pay a fair share of tax so that we can all share excellent, world-class public services. That means that those who earn most – as individuals or as companies – must make a fair contribution.</p>
      <p>To raise an extra £20bn a year it would:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reverse the British Government’s planned cut on corporation tax. Cancelling the planned cut from 19% to 17% due in 2020–21 would raise around £5 billion</li>
        <li>Income tax relief on pension contributions should be restricted to the standard rate of 20%</li>
        <li>Increase the employee rate of National Insurance Contributions for higher rate and additional rate taxpayers from 2% to 4%</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It would scrap <b>Trident.</b></p>
      <h3>Environment</h3>
      <p>It supports greater transition to organic and other sustainable farming systems and would develop plans for renewable energyby identifying ecologically sustainable sites for offshore and onshore wind energy development, as well as potential areas for solar and tidal energy development.</p>
      <p>It would:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Establish a national energy agency, Ynni Cymru, which would be charged with realising Wales’s green energy potential</li>
        <li>Fully realise marine energy potential including wave, tidal range and tidal stream energy</li>
        <li>Seek a complete ban on fracking and new open-cast coal mines</li>
        <li>Oppose the development of new sites for nuclear power stations</li>
        <li>Oppose the use of pylons through National Parks and Areas of Natural Beauty, advocating the use of underground and undersea cables to carry electricity where feasible</li>
        <li>Wants a minimum planting rate of 2,000 hectares a year from 2020</li>
        <li>Promises a new clean air act for Wales</li>
        <li>Ban single use plastics</li>
        <li>Invest in a national electric vehicle charging network</li>
        <li>A bike reward scheme where people are paid for every mile they cycle to work as in the Netherlands</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The Welsh Language and culture</h3>
      <p>Plaid wants a Welsh Education Act to ensure Welsh-medium education and would keep the Welsh Language Commissioner post.</p>
      <p>It will set up a new organisation with responsibility for comprehensive language planning.</p>
      <p>Museums will keep free entry and they want to create a National Gallery for Contemporary Art.</p>
      <p>St David's Day would be made a Bank Holiday.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What else?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It would cancel the £5bn restoration of the Palace of Westminster and wants electronic voting in the Commons.</p>
      <p>"Currently, there are 17 Assembly Members and seven Welsh MPs who employ members of their own families at the public’s expense. Whether in the Senedd, Westminster or Brussels Plaid Cymru politicians will not employ family members."</p>
      <p>It wants MPs to have the "right to speak Welsh in the House of Commons chamber so that all their constituents can feel represented".</p>
      <p>It would increase tourism promotion of Wales around the world and wants a tourism VAT on hospitality cut to 9% to put Wales ahead in the international tourism market.</p>
