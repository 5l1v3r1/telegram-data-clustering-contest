      <h1>Rumor: Future 2022 BMW X8 M to pack over 700 hp</h1>
      <h2>At the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show, the BMWBLOG team invited Markus Flasch, the BMW M CEO, to our podcast. Herr Flasch was our first …</h2>

      <p>Since the new X7 came out, there was a question that always stood out: is BMW considering an X8 as well? Yet to be officially confirmed, but it looks that the X8 will a bespoke luxury SAC with its own identity and not just an X7 Coupe. Earlier, we published the information that <a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=de&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/11/future-bmw-x8-will-have-an-m-performance-hybrid-x8-m45e/&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700256,15700259,15700262,15700265,15700271,15700283&amp;usg=ALkJrhijQ1lIbQvqsKrOzqwvSgJ6kmSjRQ">X8 prototypes</a> are already being assembled at the BMW plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina. So, it is safe to say that we will soon see the first test vehicles hitting streets all over the globe.</p>

      <p>We also heard that the highly unique BMW X8 will come in three variants with at least one of them being a full-fledged X8 M model. The third member of the X8 family was rumored to be the brand’s first M Performance hybrid with the badge <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/11/future-bmw-x8-will-have-an-m-performance-hybrid-x8-m45e/">BMW X8 M45e</a> attached to it.</p>
      <p>Autobild has also just reported that the G09 X8 lineup will include an outrageous X8 M variant. To be powered by a consistently re-engineered 4.4-liter V8 engine, the high-performance luxury SAC could boast a staggering peak output of 700 hp or beyond, which decently renders it as the most powerful BMW M model in history.</p>
      <p>We’ve also learned that almost certainly the X8 won’t take the shape of an X6 or X7, but rather have its own identify within the design language at BMW. Think along the lines of a new kidney grill design and overall shape. The X8 has always been rumored to be a more luxurious model, with a more bespoke finish for the discerning customer looking for the ultimate luxury.</p>
      <p>The X8 is expected to become the priciest BMW model in history, with the entry-level price starting somewhere near EUR 150,000 (166,000 US dollars). Powertrains will most likely include petrol and plug-in hybrid configurations. Prices for the X8 M variant could possibly start at around EUR 180,000, which is nearly a hefty 200,000 US dollars.</p>
      <p>We will likely see the BMW X8 family before 2022.</p>
