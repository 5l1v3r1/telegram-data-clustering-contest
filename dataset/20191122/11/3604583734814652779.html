      <h1>Ballarat High School students of 1969 have a chance to meet up this weekend for their 50th reunion</h1>

      <p>The 1969 students of Ballarat High School have a motto they share among themselves, says former student Judith Jhureea.</p>
      <p>"What we say to each other is: don't pretend to be something you're not, as we all know where we came from, where we started," she says.</p>

      <p>Ms Jhureea has been gradually bringing former students of BHS together over the the past few years.</p>
      <p>"I've found ex-students recently, and when I would go to Melbourne for a visit, I started saying, 'I'm here: who wants to meet up.? So it kind of snowballed from the first meeting of 10, then 20 and so on," Ms Jhureea recalls.</p>
      <p>"But this is the big one - 50 years!"</p>
      <p>A planned meeting with the current headmaster of Ballarat High at 1pm on Saturday begins a weekend of recollections and reconnections for the former students.</p>
      <p>A dinner in the Marble Lounge of the Lake View Hotel has been booked for Saturday night at 6pm, and Ms Jhureea says already she has 57 people booked.</p>

      <p>Sunday morning is a morning tea (and recovery for those who go a bit too long reminiscing on Saturday night) at Pipers on the Lake, she says.</p>
      <p>"Some of us haven't seen anyone for over 40 years," says Ms Jhureaa, who has been a stalwart in reconnecting the students.</p>
      <p>"For a lot of us it would be 25 years. At least 30 of us meet up twice a year; we all really enjoy reconnecting. Many of us have rediscovered old friendships or started new ones."</p>
      <p>Any former students who wish to attend can contact Judith Jhureea on Facebook.</p>
