      <p>Caitlyn opened up about her family relationships to fellow contestants Kate Garraway, Adele Roberts, Nadine Coyle and Jaqueline Jossa.</p>
      <p>And Caitlyn, who used to be Olympic-winning athlete Bruce Jenner before she transitioned in 2015, said: "Bruce raised them and Caitlyn is enjoying their life with them."</p>
      <p>Caitlyn, star of reality shows I Am Cait and The Keeping Up With The Kardashians, has six children and a whopping 19 grandchildren.</p>
      <p>She's father to Burt and Cassandra from Bruce's first marriage to Chrystie, and two sons from Bruce's second marriage to Linda Thompson.</p>
      <p>In 1991, Caitlyn - then still Bruce - married Kris Kardashian and had two daughters - Kendall, 24, and Kylie, 22 - and became step-parent to Kris's four children from her previous marriage, Kourtney, Kim, Khloé and Robert.</p>

      <p>"My kids all call me Dad," he said.</p>
      <aside>Kendall asked me first and I said 'Dad', I'm your Dad and I'll always be your Dad till the day I die.</aside>
      <p>"Kendall asked me first and I said 'Dad', I'm your Dad and I'll always be your Dad till the day I die.</p>
      <p>"But what they're really good at, which shocks me all the time, is when they're talking about me - 'my Dad, she' - and it's tough to change the pronoun in the middle of it."</p>

      <p>Earlier in the series, Caitlyn <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-star-caitlyn-jenner-hiding-devastating-secret-from-her-past/">revealed that she had been hiding a dark tragedy from her fellow campmates</a>.</p>
      <p>The reality star - who won Olympic gold at the 1500 metres as Bruce Jenner in 1976 - lost her brother in a tragic accident the same year she won gold in Montreal.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn, then Bruce, was 26 when her younger brother, Burt, died while driving a silver Porsche that Caitlyn had allowed him to borrow.</p>
