      <p>The site of a controversial planning scheme has been sold by developer Rightacres.</p>
      <p>Rightacres had bought the former Track 2000 site in Grangetown and planned a development of flats.</p>
      <p>The developer, which is behind the Central Square scheme in Cardiff, had wanted to build flats up to six storeys high.</p>
      <p>The disused <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/track-2000-demolition-grangetown-cardiff-16145068">building was knocked down</a> and the land has been empty since.</p>
      <p>It had planned a building, which was to be known as the Bottle Works, which would have contained 74 flats.</p>
      <p>It would have contained two, one-bed studios, 39 one-bed flats, 32 two-bed flats and one three-bed flat.</p>
      <p>There would have been 57 parking spaces and 72 bike spots.</p>

      <p>However, Rightacres has confirmed it has sold the land to an unnamed housing association.</p>
      <p>Paul McCarthy, Rightacres Chief Executive said: "We acquired the site with the intention to build a much needed residential scheme.</p>
      <p>"Rightacres always take into account the sensitivities of the local community and having received an offer from a housing association we felt that affordable housing for local people was the most appropriate solution for this site."</p>
      <p>The Rightacres scheme was unpopular with local residents.</p>
      <p>Local residents feared a loss of privacy and worsening problems with traffic <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/residents-fear-loss-privacy-over-15236956">if it went ahead.</a></p>
      <p>There were concerns they would pay only £30,000 out of the £1.3m that the council had asked for, under what is known as <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/track-2000-grangetown-cardiff-embankment-16456224">the Section 106 agreement.</a></p>
      <p>Cardiff council had originally asked for £1,361,363 from the developer - £1,157,912 would have gone towards affordable housing while the rest would have gone towards public open space, community facilities and jobs in Grangetown, as well as traffic regulations.</p>

      <p>But an independent review said the development "would be rendered unviable" if any contributions were sought by Rightacres.</p>
      <p>However, as planning permission has been granted by Cardiff council, it will remain valid for the standard five years.</p>
      <p>It will be up to the new owner whether to continue with the plans which were given permission by Cardiff council's planning committee.</p>
      <p>The three Labour ward councillors, Ashley Lister, Lynda Thorne and Abdul Sattar issued a statement in response.</p>
      <p>"As ward councillors we have opposed the development of the Track 2000 site on a number of factors from traffic and waste issues, to loss of light.</p>
      <p>"We’re now aware that the site has been sold to a housing association to develop and provide much needed social housing in the area.</p>
      <p>"Every week we hear from residents living in poor quality conditions who are desperate to move into a good standard, affordable home.</p>
      <p>"Whilst we welcome the move towards social housing, we will continue to raise our longstanding concerns with the new land owner."</p>
