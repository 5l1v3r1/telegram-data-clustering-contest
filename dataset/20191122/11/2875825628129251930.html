      <p>Former Sheffield United academy manager John Pemberton has revealed Harry Maguire wanted to be a centre midfielder before his transformation into the centre-back he is today.</p>
      <p>Pemberton helped develop Maguire during his time at Bramall Lane before he eventually moved on to Hull in 2014, and is a big part of the reason why he eventually made his eyewatering £80m move to Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1356290/2019/11/22/harry-maguire-thought-he-would-be-a-midfielder-but-i-said-no-if-you-go-to-centre-half-you-can-be-the-best/">The Athletic</a> Pemberton said he did not feel Maguire was a good enough midfielder to make it at the top level, and convinced him to change into a defensive role.</p>
      <p>"Harry was playing centre midfield when I first met him," Pemberton said. "The problem for me was I just didn’t see his future there. He was a centre-half to me.</p>

      <p>"I remember sitting him down in my office. We had quite a few chats over the years, mainly because he liked asking questions about the game. Anyway, this time I ended up asking him, ‘Where do you see yourself in three years’ time?’ He said the first team but I pushed him on a position. He thought centre midfield but I said, ‘No’."</p>
      <p>Pemberton told Maguire he would never make it to become one of the top midfielders in the country, and convinced him to try his hand at the back.</p>
      <p>"Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard were the elite midfielders in the Premier League at the time and I told Harry he would never be as good at that position as them," he added.</p>

      <p>"I said there were a lot of young midfielders out there who could do the same as him. But I then went on to say, ‘If you go to centre-half, you can be the best in that position’. He understood what I was saying, agreed to move back, and worked as hard as he could to become the player he is today.”</p>
      <p>Maguire has had a solid start to his career at United, and will next be in action when they take on his former club Sheffield United on Sunday.</p>
