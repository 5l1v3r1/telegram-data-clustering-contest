      <p>On Thursday, reports emerged from Italy that Balotelli had been banished from a training session by Brescia manager Fabio Grosso.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Gazzetta dello Sport</i>, the striker was dismissed by Grosso after he had approached some training drills in a lazy fashion.</p>
      <p>The former AC Milan, Inter Milan and Manchester City forward then reportedly headed straight for the locker room, after which he left the ground altogether.</p>
