      <h1>Fleetwood Town head coach Joey Barton calls for politics and sport to be kept apart</h1>
      <h2>Football and politics are not a good mix according to Fleetwood Town head coach Joey Barton.</h2>

      <p>Town last week put out a statement pledging their support to the Conservatives in the upcoming General Election, with the club’s owner, Andy Pilley, giving a guided tour to the Tory candidate for the area.</p>
      <p>Pilley defended the club’s decision to back the Tories on Twitter, when questioned about the consequences to what is a working-class area.</p>
      <p>Barton, who has appeared on the BBC’s ‘Question Time’ in the past, believes that sport and politics aren’t a match.</p>
      <p>He said: “You would always like football to remain free of politics, really.</p>
      <p>“Politicians tend to use any means necessary to get a majority to give themselves influence.</p>
      <p>“I can understand why they’d want to use sport, and football, as the dominant sport in this country, in particular.</p>
      <p>“I always think when you mix politics and football together, it doesn’t really end well.”</p>
      <p>Barton can see similarities between politics and his own line of work but wants to see a degree of intelligence and honesty from those involved.</p>
      <p>“You just have to approach it with common sense,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s tough to tell anyone to vote a certain way, ideally we wouldn’t be forced to choose the best of two relatively ineffective people for any job.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes that does happen to football managers. Sometimes you need a left-back and there aren’t a great deal of left-backs, so you have to take what’s on offer.</p>
      <p>“People will have to weigh up the pros and cons, how it affects them.</p>
      <p>“The thing that gets me is the fearmongering and the lies.</p>
      <p>“Let’s be honest, I wouldn’t let Boris Johnson walk my dog, so how are we going to let him run the country?</p>
      <p>“But on the flip side there are a lot of things going on. Politics are a mess right now.</p>
      <p>“I’m just going to focus on football really and stay away from what is a potential bad situation for all.</p>
      <p>“Once you start choosing people to choose sides, once you start forcing people to be divided, I just think you end up with nonsense.”</p>
