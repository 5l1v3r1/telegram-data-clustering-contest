      <h1>‘Michael Edwards should get keys to the city…’ Some Reds on Twitter in awe of €8m sale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T11:02:12+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 11:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/washngog/" target="_blank">Wash N'Gog</a></address>
      <p>Loris Karius’s loan spell at Besiktas looks set to be turned permanent if reports in <a href="https://www.fanatik.com.tr/besiktas-transfer-haberi-4-taksitle-loris-karius-haber-fotograf-2103270-2">Fanatik</a> [<a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/club-want-sign-liverpool-player-four-instalments/">via Sport Witness</a>] are to be believed.</p>
      <p>They suggest the Turkish club want the former Liverpool stopper long-term after a good start to the season and that they’ll pay €8m to get it done over four years.</p>
      <p>Karius’s infamous spell at Liverpool seems like a very long time ago, but he actually only departed in 2018 – not long after his performance in the Champions League Final that cost us the trophy in Madrid.</p>
      <p>Thankfully now we have Alisson, the world’s best stopper, and the very capable Adrian as his deputy.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard arrived in the summer on a Bosman and let nobody down, winning all the Premier League games he featured in.</p>
      <p>Fans on Twitter have been lauding Michael Edwards for negotiating the Karius deal, with some suggesting he’s an alien!</p>
      <p>His history of selling deadwood for good money is legendary, in fairness. We’ve made profit on Jordon Ibe, Dom Solanke, Danny Ings, Kevin Stewart, Brad Smith and countless others despite them having absolutely zero chance of featuring in Jurgen Klopp’s first-team.</p>
      <p>The man’s a genius!</p>
