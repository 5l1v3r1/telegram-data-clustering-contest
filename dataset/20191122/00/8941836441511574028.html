      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-r-bolton/">John R. Bolton</a>, President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s former national security adviser, returned to Twitter Friday for the first time since leaving the administration more than two months earlier.</p>
      <p>“Glad to be back on Twitter after more than two months,” his verified @AmbJohnBolton account tweeted. “For the backstory, stay tuned……..”</p>
      <p>“We have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor,” the account tweeted around 2.5 hours later Friday morning. “More to come…..”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-r-bolton/">Mr. Bolton</a>, a longtime consultant and former U.N. ambassador, last tweeted amid breaking news of his separation from the administration.</p>
      <p>“I informed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-r-bolton/">John Bolton</a> last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> tweeted Sept. 10. “I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration.”</p>

      <p>“I offered to resign last night and President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> said, ‘Let’s talk about it tomorrow,’” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-r-bolton/">Mr. Bolton</a> tweeted roughly 15 minutes later that afternoon. His account had not posted since.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-r-bolton/">Mr. Bolton</a>, 71, joined the Trump administration in April 2018. He previously served as the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. under President George W. Bush.</p>
