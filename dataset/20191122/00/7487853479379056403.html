      <p><b>Marc-André ter Stegen​ (GK) - </b>Barcelona's number one has not missed a minute in La Liga this season. He played for Germany against Northern Ireland in midweek, but returned from international duty unscathed and will be raring to go.</p>
      <p><b>Moussa Wagué (RB) - </b>The youngster is expected to make his first La Liga appearance of the season after Barcelona's string of injury woes at fullback. <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/nelson-semedo">​Nelson Semedo</a> is out, while <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/sergio-roberto">​Sergi Roberto</a> is suspended, paving the way for the 21-year-old Senegalese international to get his chance.</p>
      <p><b>Gerard Pique (CB) - </b><a href="https://www.90min.com/players/gerard-pique">​Pique</a> should be well rested for the trip to Leganes having not featured for Spain after retiring from international football in 2018, though he did pour a lot of time and energy into his Davis Cup project these last couple of weeks.</p>
      <p><b>Clément L</b><b>englet (CB) - </b>The France international played 180 minutes for his country over the international break, but will be expected to start nonetheless after starting 10 of Barcelona's 12 La Liga fixtures this season.</p>
      <p><b>Júnior Firpo (LB) - </b>Injury to Jordi Alba means young left-back Júnior Firpo is likely to make his sixth La Liga appearance of the season, having seen limited game time since his summer move from Real Betis. </p>

      <p><b>Sergio Busquets (DM) - </b>Busquets wi​ll anchor the midfield in place of the suspended Sergio Roberto, who played ahead of him last time out for La Blaugrana. The Spain international played 90 minutes for his country against Romania on Monday. </p>
      <p><b>Frenkie de Jong (CM) - </b>The Dutchman is enjoying a strong first season at the Nou Camp, having appeared in every Barcelona fixture so far this campaign and immediately becoming a key figure in midfield. He returns from international duty having featured in both of his country's Euro 2020 qualifiers.</p>
      <p><b>Arthur (CM) - </b>The Brazilian has come on leaps and bounds in his second season at Barcelona, with his increased fitness evident after not playing a full 90 minutes for the entirety of the 2018/19 season. He has already recorded two goals and three assists this campaign.</p>

The Argentinian is enjoying his usual remarkable form this season, with eight goals in seven La Liga appearances.</p>
      <p><b>Antoine Griezmann</b> ​<b>(LW) - </b>Barcelona's marquee signing has not settled into life at Camp Nou as quickly as some may have been expecting, although he has managed four goals and three assists so far this season.
