      <h1>Highways are new homes for trees</h1>

      <p>Even as civic authorities in the city are resorting to saving trees by transplanting them, similar efforts are picking pace even on highways. Tree transplantation experts are getting requests from government authorities and private firms to transplant the trees on to highways. <br/><br/><br/>Recently, tree transplantation experts have also been getting requests from the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) in the Chitradurga region as there are several road infrastructure activities being taken up here. Ilango Subramanyam, a tree transplantation expert told BM, “Tree transplantations are not only limited to city limits. Transplantation of trees on highways is a good development. Transplanting on highways will also help in the reduction of heatwave and ensure that greenery is maintained,” he said. <br/><br/>About the transplantation work on the highways, Illango said that already on the Bengaluru-Krishnagiri highway and Bengaluru- Salem highway around 56 trees have been transplanted, which have a survival rate of 90 per cent. “Some firms are also coming forward to transplant the trees on the highways. One company gave space near the compound to transplant the trees displaced due to the road widening project.” <br/><br/><br/>He also said that the NHAI is in talks with the tree experts near Chitradurga. “We have given our proposals to NHAI as they are widening a highway in the region. We are ready to transplant the trees there too. We can shift the trees and put them on highways. There are a lot of companies along the highways and they can also help save the trees.”</p>
