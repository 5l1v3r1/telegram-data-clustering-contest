      <h3>Microvi MNE Technology Becomes Bay Area’s First Full-Scale Wastewater Sidestream Treatment System</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.microvi.com/latest-news/2019/11/19/microvi-mne-technology-selected-as-bay-areas-first-full-scale-wastewater-sidestream-treatment-in-multi-million-dollar-project-at-oro-loma-sanitary-district">Microvi Biotech Inc.</a> and <a href="https://oroloma.org/">Oro Loma Sanitary District (OLSD)</a> have announced the installation of a full-scale Microvi MNE wastewater sidestream treatment system at the 20 MGD OLSD treatment plant in San Lorenzo, Calif., in 2020. The multi-million dollar collaborative project will be conducted between Microvi, OLSD and engineering firm HDR Inc. and is funded by the U.S. EPA. </p>
      <p>This full-scale installation follows an EPA-funded analysis of sidestream treatment in the Bay Area. The analysis, led by East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD), showed that treating this small volume of highly concentrated effluent is a cost-effective strategy to substantially reduce nitrogen loads for 21 Bay Area treatment plants with anaerobic digesters. </p>
      <p>“Microvi MNE is a dynamic and unique biological solution that has the power to make a significant positive impact on our environment and for the communities we serve. We are excited to work with Oro Loma Sanitary District and the U.S. EPA in implementing breakthrough solutions that benefit society and the planet,” said Dr. Fatemeh Shirazi, CEO of Microvi. </p>
