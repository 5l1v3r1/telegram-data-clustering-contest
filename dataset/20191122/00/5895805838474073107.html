      <p>I believe we are all artists. Yes, that even includes those of us who couldn’t sing on key or draw something more sophisticated than a stick figure even if our lives depended on it. I define an artist as someone who expresses him or herself through their own <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/authenticity">authenticity</a>. In other words, when you are out in the world doing something that fuels you, then you are living your art.</p>
      <p>The possibilities are endless; there are just as many unique and different forms of art as there are people in the world. I find that notion to be exhilarating. The question is— how can knowing our own art form actually improve our lives in any way? I’ll tell you this—over the last two decades of working with clients and helping people live a life that reflects their personal truth, I have witnessed firsthand the undeniable power of discovering one’s art form. I’ve seen that flicker return to their eyes. It’s been described to me as going from a world of black and white to full spectrum technicolor. I’ve experienced it myself, several times actually. Because the truth is, our art form evolves over time. Of course it does! And that’s exactly why I believe we should all check in with ourselves from time to time and connect with our art.</p>
      <p>So, what is your art form? Rather than frame this as a “why were you put on this planet” kind of question, which creates way too much pressure, think of it as a question about what lights your fire. And remove all judgment or preconceived beliefs from the equation before you dive in, because your “art” can be absolutely anything. It could be fixing someone’s washing machine. It could be gardening, and producing food for those in your community. Maybe it’s writing songs, even if they’re only performed for an audience of one. Perhaps you are passionate about caring for the elderly. I once talked to a server in a restaurant who just had the most contagious sense of joy, and she’d been working at that same burger joint for 25 years. She told me that she loved going to work every day, and that with every delicious meal she placed in front of a patron, she felt a little tingle of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness">happiness</a>. So, yes, even waiting tables can be an art form, and a deeply fulfilling one at that.</p>
      <p>Here are some prompts to help you get started: when was the last time you felt excited about your life? What were you doing in that moment? What’s something you used to be passionate about but haven’t thought about in a long time? If you could pause your responsibilities for just one day, what would you do with that time? What’s the most fun you’ve ever had without spending money? If you were 100 years old and looking back at your life, what’s one thing you would wish you’d done more often? You get the idea. Give yourself the freedom to tap into your <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/creativity">creativity</a>. It won’t take long to discover what’s just under the surface.</p>
      <p>Once you connect with your inner artist, get busy sharing it with the world. It needs you in ways you can’t yet imagine.</p>
