      <h1>Champagnie leads Pitt over Arkansas-Pine Bluff 66-41</h1>

      <p>PITTSBURGH (AP) - At one point, it looked like <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/justin-champagnie/">Justin Champagnie</a> might not have a freshman season with Pittsburgh.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/justin-champagnie/">Champagnie</a>, a 6-foot-6 wing from Brooklyn, New York, suffered a knee injury in the lead-up to the season that was feared to be season ending.</p>
      <p>But after a second opinion, he was allowed to return to the court. That’s been a very good thing for Pitt.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/justin-champagnie/">Champagnie</a> scored a career-high 18 points as the Panthers (4-2) rolled to a 66-41 victory over Arkansas Pine-Bluff (0-5) on Thursday.</p>
      <p>He has come on strong for Pitt - it was his fourth consecutive game in double figures. Against the Golden Lions, he shot 6 of 10 from the floor and grabbed five rebounds.</p>

      <p>“We think he’s talented kid, but we want more from him,” Pitt head coach Jeff Capel said. “He’s really played well all year, but there’s a few more levels that we think he can get to and we’re going to be on him to get there.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/justin-champagnie/">Champagnie</a> did most of his work in the paint, where Pitt had a 36-20 advantage. Eric Hamilton had 12 points and eight rebounds in the first half before being limited later due to foul trouble.</p>
      <p>Xavier Johnson scored 13 points and was a threat shooting over the Golden Lions’ zone. He was 3 of 7 from 3-point range.</p>
      <p>The Panthers never trailed in the game, steadily grew the lead to 13 points at halftime and pulled away in the second period for the 25-point margin of victory, Pitt’s largest of the season. It was the lowest point total the Panthers allowed since holding Holy Cross to 39 points on Dec. 23, 2014.</p>

        <p>Markedric Bell singlehandedly kept things close for Arkansas-Pine Bluff. He scored 21 points on 10-of-19 shooting.</p>
        <p>The Lions were unable to replicate the formula that helped them give Kansas State a scare earlier in the week, mostly due to a poor first half shooting and too many turnovers. The Lions shot 23.1% in the first half and turned the ball over 22 time.</p>
        <p>“Any time you play against a good basketball team, you can’t just turn it over like that, because they’re going to get their opportunities and score the basketball,” Arkansas Pine-Bluff head coach George Ivory said.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>Arkansas-Pine Bluff, already facing an uphill climb against a high-major opponent, played without a pair of starting post players in small forward Shaun Doss and center Terrance Banyard. As a result, Ivory opened his bench, playing 13 different men in the contest.</p>
        <p>“We are just trying to get some more guys getting used to playing some minutes that they usually wouldn’t play,” Ivory said.</p>
        <p>Pitt had yet to completely dominate an inferior opponent through an up-and-down start to the season. After losing to Nicholls State, they had to sweat out a slow first half against Robert Morris before pulling away late.</p>
        <p>“I just think it was like a confidence booster, in a way” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/justin-champagnie/">Champagnie</a> said. “At the same time, we play against harder teams. We’ve got to take this win and move on.”</p>
        <p>EARLY LOOK</p>
        <p>Pitt was happy to play against the zone of Arkansas-Pine Bluff, because the Panthers will have two games this season with notoriously zone-heavy Syracuse. The matchup with the Golden Lions made for useful prep.</p>
        <p>“It was a good game for us,” Johnson said. “We know we’re going to see it again. Obviously, Syracuse. This was perfect for what we’ve got to do against them.”</p>
