      <p>International human rights group, Clooney Foundation for Justice, has condemned the continued detention of pro-democracy campaigner and Publisher of SaharaReporters, Omoyele Sowore, by the Department of State Services – Nigeria’s secret police.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Friday, the group said that its TrialWatch initiative has been monitoring the trial of Sowore in Nigeria and was deeply concerned about his situation.</p>
      <p>Co-President of the Clooney Foundation for Justice, Amal Clooney, called on the Nigerian Government to immediately release Sowore, who on Thursday was designated a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International.</p>
      <p>Clooney said, “It is outrageous that Nigeria continues to imprison a journalist and presidential candidate after a court had ordered his release.</p>
      <p>“TrialWatch will continue to monitor Sowore's trial and calls on the authorities to implement the court’s order as soon as possible.”</p>

      <p>Sowore, famed globally for exposing Nigeria's corrupt politicians, was arrested in Lagos on August 3, 2019 for calling on Nigerians to take to the streets in peaceful demonstrations to demand a better country from the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.</p>
      <p>The government is accusing him of insulting Buhari and planning to bring down his regime – charges observers around the world have described as baseless.</p>

      <p>Despite two separate orders by the Federal High Court in Abuja directing his release after meeting stringent bail conditions, the DSS has refused to release Sowore, casting a huge shadow over the human rights record of Buhari’s regime.
