      <p>Ireland meanwhile are undefeated against Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, having faced them three times and won twice. The most recent victory coming in 2015 during a Euro 2016 qualifier.</p>
      <p>Dublin has been chosen as one of the 12 host cities for next summer's Euro 2020 finals.</p>
      <p>Should Ireland successfully qualify, Dublin will be guaranteed at least two games at the Aviva Stadium.</p>
