      <h1>Bridgewater Associates bets over $1 billion on market drop: WSJ</h1>

      <p>(Reuters) - Bridgewater Associates LP, a hedge fund founded by billionaire Ray Dalio, has bet more than $1 billion that stock markets around the world will fall by March, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>The bet, assembled over a span of months and executed by a handful of Wall Street firms, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (N:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/goldman-sachs-group">GS</a>) and Morgan Stanley (N:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/morgan-stanley">MS</a>), would pay off for the world's biggest hedge fund if either the S&amp;P 500 (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500">SPX</a>) or the Euro Stoxx 50 (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/eu-stoxx50">STOXX50E</a>) — or both — declines, the report said.</p>
      <p>The bet is made up of put options, contracts that give investors the right to sell stocks at a specific price by a certain date. The options expire in March and currently represent one of the largest bearish bets against the market, the report added.</p>
      <p>Bridgewater Associates was not immediately available for comment.</p>
