      <p>BBC Three Controller Fiona Campbell called the show "a brilliant success story" and said the network is "delighted they're coming back for a third series".</p>
      <p>And it seems the series has already wrapped on filming, according to creator Peter Foott-- which means the lads could make their return very soon.</p>
      <p>"We are so grateful to BBC Three and thrilled they had such faith in the stories and characters of The Young Offenders that they commissioned a third series from us," Peter Foott said, adding that they "had a lot of fun filming series two and three back to back over the summer in Cork".</p>
      <p>"We've been amazed at the huge reaction to series two so far, and we're so happy that we can officially announce that there's more on the way for fans of the show," he said.</p>
      <p>Absolutely buzzing.</p>
      <p>Series 2 of the hit comedy continues on Monday nights on BBC One and RTE 2 and can be watched on BBC iPlayer and RTÉ Player.</p>
