        <b>The Chateau Impney hillclimb and Historic Formula 2 were among the major winners at the Royal Automobile Club Historic Awards.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Presented for the first time at the Pall Mall Clubhouse on Thursday, the Awards celebrate the diversity and people involved in the British historic motoring and motorsport.</p>
      <p>The Chateau Impney hillclimb was presented with the award for the best competitive event, while the best race series was won by the Historic Sports Car Club's International Historic Formula 2 Series.</p>
      <p>Other winners included The Jim Clark Motorsport Museum (best collection), and the 1967 Jim Clark Lotus Ford Type 38 Indianapolis car from Nick Fennell and Classic Team Lotus as the best restoration.</p>
      <p>The judges commended the Chateau Impney hillclimb's winning combination of a classic venue, excellent organisation, proper competition from a strong entry and great facilities and attractions for visitors.</p>
      <p>The HSCC's Historic Formula 2 series has gone from strength to strength this year, including a spectacular showcase at the Silverstone Classic.</p>
      <p>Judges praised the "hard graft and inspired leadership which has seen this charismatic series finally fulfil its potential with sensational grids in 2019".</p>

      <p>Andy Dee-Crowne, CEO of the HSCC said: "Historic Formula 2 is the success story of the 2019 historic racing season. It can only go from strength to strength.</p>
      <p>"We'd like to thank Duncan Wiltshire and the Royal Automobile Club for organising these awards and we congratulate all the other finalists and winners."</p>
      <p>In selecting the Jim Clark Motorsport Museum as the best collection category winner, the judges commented: "The museum conveys a sense of place like few others, linking the stories of Jim Clark and the nearby towns, and encouraging visitors to explore those links through a trail that takes in his farm and grave, amongst others.</p>
      <p>"It has done an extraordinary job in attracting over 1000 visitors a month to Duns, which is not on the normal tourist trail and requires a committed journey to reach."</p>
      <p>Judging for the restoration category included a head-to-head session at which all the finalists were gathered together at Bicester Heritage.</p>
      <p>Clark's 1967 Lotus Type 38 Indy car beat stiff competition for the award, with he judges saying: "The Lotus just pipped the other finalists to first place with the team's remarkable attention to detail and its quest to return 38/7 to 1967 Indy 500 specification.</p>
      <p>"The dedication to finding original parts to return the car to the correct asymmetric suspension, two-speed ZF transmission and accurate livery is truly inspirational."</p>
