        <b>In Ukrainian cities, the sixth anniversary of the so-called Maidan protests has been held remembering the barricade movement that ousted the pro-Kremlin President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, and resulted in the death of around a hundred people.</b>
      </p>
      <p>U.S. news portal <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/30285789.html">Radio Free Europe reports</a> that the commemorative events took place on Thursday, November 21. The Maidan protest in Kyiv started on November 21, 2013, after then-President Viktor Yanukovych announced he was rejecting a far-ranging political and economic pact with the European Union called an Association Agreement. The same day, then-Prime Minister Mykola Azarov’s cabinet shelved the agreement.</p>
      <p>According to the United Nations, 98 people were killed – including 84 protesters and 13 law-enforcement officers – during nearly three months of protests in central Kyiv’s Independence (Maidan) Square.</p>
      <h3>Ukraine’s Prosecutor-General’s Office has stated that 104 people were killed.</h3>
      <p>Radio Free Europe reports that in the commemorations, several hundred people assembled in Kyiv on the street where most of the protesters were shot, known as the Alleyway of the Heavenly Hundred. They brought flowers and icon lamps, and a prayer service for the dead was held in the evening.</p>
