      <p>When the virus may be norovirus, you can’t just ignore-a-virus. That’s why over 22,000 students in Colorado will have no class. Well, at least for today and tomorrow. Diana Sirko, PhD, the Superintendent of Schools for Mesa County Valley School District 51, <a href="https://www.d51schools.org/news/what_s_new/all_district_51_schools_closed_nov__21-22?fbclid=IwAR0mpfESWYkzYvMxXfduKvUQ9zmjIZ5bEykZc5BCm5u5-7rbuhaBfq7UqRk">has announced the closing of the entire school district</a> through the end of this school week. That’s all 46 schools in District 51.</p>
      <p>The reason is that hundreds of students and teachers have already gotten ill with vomiting and diarrhea. Although the cause has not yet been clearly identified yet, this sounds suspiciously like norovirus. Yes, norovirus, the virus that Aron Hall, DVM, MSPH, DACVPM, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4699433/">the “perfect human pathogen.”</a></p>
      <p>Hall wasn’t singing a sonnet to or posting a Match.com ad for norovirus. He was describing how the virus has all the characteristics that an infectious pathogen would want to have. In other words, if other viruses and bacteria could talk, you might hear some norovirus-envy.</p>

        <figcaption>Symptoms usually emerge 12 to 48 hours after you are exposed to norovirus. Typical symptoms are ... [+] diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and stomach pain.

      <p>That’s because norovirus, in the words of the Beach Boys and 2Pac, knows how to get around. It also knows how to stay around. It’s highly contagious. It only takes a very small number of virus particles to make you sick. When you are infected, you rapidly and prolifically shed the virus, two things that would make you a bad party guest but a great viral host. Up to 30% of those infected may not ever show any symptoms. Thus, you may be spreading much more than your charm when you are out and about.</p>
      <p>If you do get sick, you can become a two-ended fire hydrant of vomiting and diarrhea, propelling the virus everywhere Exorcist-style. . This typically lasts for one to three days. However, all does not necessarily return to normal after the symptoms go away. You may still keep shedding the virus for over two more weeks after you’ve seemingly recovered. Yep, norovirus is the gift that keeps on giving.</p>
      <p>Then there’s the problem with the cleanup on aisle sick. Standard cleaning measures often don’t really get rid of norovirus. After you think you have cleaned a place sullied with vomit or diarrhea, it may be just like Hans from the movie <i>Frozen</i>, appearing clean but still really dirty. The CDC provides the following video on how to clean up a mess that may have norovirus:</p>
      <p>District 51 should heed these steps. That means perhaps using more bleach than prep for a Madonna fan convention would seem to use. They’ll have thoroughly dispose of or wash everything that may have been contaminated. They should wear gloves and protective gear while doing so. Containing such an outbreak is not easy. After all, norovirus is a tough customer. A nasty customer. In fact, maybe even a perfect one.</p>
