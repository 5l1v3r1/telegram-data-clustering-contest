      <p>Billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has indicated interest in joining the race to secure the Democratic Party’s nomination for US president.</p>
      <p>He has filed paperwork ahead of a deadline for the Democratic primary election in Alabama.</p>
      <p>The move is a necessary step to join the race to be the party’s candidate to take on President Donald Trump in next year’s election.</p>
      <p>The 77-year-old Bloomberg has not formally confirmed his candidacy.</p>
      <p>However, spokesman Jason Schechter told US media that an announcement “could come as early as next week”.</p>
      <p>The businessman is said to be concerned the current Democratic contenders would not pose a strong enough challenge to Trump in 2020.</p>
      <p>He will be entering a crowded field as one of 17 candidates hoping to be chosen as the Democratic nominee.</p>
      <p>Former Vice President Joe Biden is the frontrunner, followed by senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.</p>
      <p>The tycoon had strongly hinted that he would run, with his adviser Howard Wolfson releasing a statement on Thursday evening saying they wanted to “ensure that Trump is defeated” in the election next year.</p>
      <p>“But Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of [Democratic] candidates is not well positioned to do that,” he added.</p>
