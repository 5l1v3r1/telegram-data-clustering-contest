      <p>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) - Freshman <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tyrell-terry/">Tyrell Terry</a> was having trouble with his long-range shooting, so he put in some extra work. It paid off.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tyrell-terry/">Terry</a> scored 21 points to go with 10 rebounds and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> opened its season with six straight victories for the first time in 11 years, beating William &amp; Mary 81-50 Thursday night.</p>
      <p>“I told him during the recruiting process that every team I’ve seen him play on takes his personality,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> coach Jerod Haase said. “He’s doing a great job of passing the ball.”</p>
      <p>Oscar da Silva and Daejon Davis added 14 points apiece for the Cardinal (6-0), who are off to their best start since opening the 2008-09 season with 10 straight wins.</p>
      <p>Andy Van Vliet, the reigning CAA Player of the Week, scored 11 points to lead the Tribe (4-2), who have lost two in a row since opening with four wins. Quinn Blair added 10 points.</p>

      <p>“I don’t know what our team can take away from this kind of game,” Tribe coach Dane Fischer said. “Anytime you play at the highest level, which this is, it’s a great opportunity for the guys to take on some great competition. We played great the other night at Oklahoma. But I didn’t think we had the same effort or energy tonight. That’s something we can work on.</p>
      <p>Senior Nathan Knight, who scored 30 points in William &amp; Mary’s loss to the Sooners, made 2 of 4 from the field and had five rebounds before fouling out. He was averaging a double-double through the first five games.</p>
      <p>“It was a team effort,” Haase said. “We used multiple guys on him. Mostly Bryce (Wills), who did a great job. His versatility is unbelievable. He can guard so many different players.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tyrell-terry/">Terry</a> was 8 of 11 from the field, including a 5 of 7 effort from 3-point range.</p>

        <p>“We had to put two halves together,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tyrell-terry/">Terry</a> said. “We made it a goal to play a full 40 minutes.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> freshman Spencer Jones scored his first 2-point basket of the season with just over 12 minutes to play on a driving layup. His first 17 field goals were all from 3-point range.</p>
        <p>“We had been giving him a hard time about that,” Davis said. “That’s why he pointed to us and gave us the peace sign.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> outscored the Tribe 8-2 over the final two minutes of the first half to take a 39-25 lead.</p>
        <p>William &amp; Mary went scoreless for a span of 4:26 in the first half.</p>
        <p>IT’S BEEN AWHILE</p>
        <p>William &amp; Mary made its third appearance at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a>, though it was just the second meeting between the schools. The Tribe last played the Cardinal here in a tournament in 1987. They also played in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> Invitational in 1998 but did not meet the hosts. That’s the last time William &amp; Mary has played a game in California. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> is also the Tribe’s first Pac-12 opponent since playing at Arizona State in 1996.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>William &amp; Mary: The Tribe opened the season by matching a school record with three consecutive road victories. They started 4-0 for the first time in 27 years and Dane Fischer became the first coach to win his first four games at William &amp; Mary since the 1943-44 season.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a>: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tyrell-terry/">Tyrell Terry</a> became the first freshman since at least 1996 to reach double figures in scoring in each of his first five games. He’s brought a 14.0 scoring average into play Thursday, which includes a 16-of-17 effort from the foul line (.941). He also leads the team in assists (3.4).</p>
