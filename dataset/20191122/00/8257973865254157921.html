      <p>WASHINGTON -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jon_Voight/?tps=1">Jon Voight</a> is "an actor of astonishing range and depth" and "somebody I happen to really like," President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a> said Thursday as he awarded the Oscar-winning actor the National Medal of Arts during a White House ceremony.</p>
      <p>Voight was one of four recipients of the National Medal of Arts, alongside bluegrass-country singer <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Alison_Krauss/?tps=1">Alison Krauss</a>, philanthropist Sharon Percy Rockefeller and the musicians of the U.S. military, who were recognized by the White House for "personifying excellence in music and service to country."</p>
      <p>Trump recognized Voight for "his exceptional capacity as an actor to portray deeply complex characters" and to give "insights into the richness of the human mind and heart."</p>
      <p>"Jon captures the imagination of the audiences and dominates almost every single scene he is in," the president said.</p>
      <p>It was the first time the Trump administration has awarded the medal; it was an annual honor in past administrations. The last ceremony was held in 2016 by President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Barack_Obama/?tps=1">Barack Obama</a>.</p>
      <p>Voight, who is also the father of actor <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Angelina-Jolie/?tps=1">Angelina Jolie</a>, won the Academy Award for best actor in 1978 for his portrayal of a paraplegic Vietnam War veteran in the movie <i>Coming Home</i>. He starred in the Academy Award-winning <i>Midnight Cowboy</i>, too.</p>
      <p>In May, the actor posted two videos on Twitter in which he affirmed his support for Trump, calling him "the greatest president since <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Abraham_Lincoln/?tps=1">Abraham Lincoln</a>." Earlier in the year, the president appointed Voight to be a trustee of the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kennedy-Assassination/?tps=1">John F. Kennedy</a> Center for the Performing Arts through 2024.</p>
      <p>Trump also awarded a National Humanities Medal to chef Patrick J. O'Connell, philanthropist Teresa Lozano Long, the Claremont Institute and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/James_Patterson/?tps=1">James Patterson</a>.</p>
      <p>Patterson, the Edgar Award-winning author of numerous books, including a 2016 investigative book about multimillionaire sex offender <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jeffrey_Epstein/?tps=1">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, is "one of the most prolific and talented fiction writers of all times," Trump said.</p>
      <p>The author has sold more than 400 million books worldwide.</p>
      <p>"I don't talk about the books that I have done in his presence because he has outdone me by a lot. You have sold a lot more books than me," Trump joked. "I guess you have sold a lot more books than anyone, but maybe one -- I think the Bible has you by a little bit."</p>
      <p>The president also thanked The Inn At Little Washington chef O'Connell for "filling us with pride in our national cuisine." In 1978, O'Connell transformed a gas station into the three-Michelin Star restaurant.</p>
      <p>"Every day he and his team pursue absolute perfection," he said. "He is a trailblazing industry pioneer."</p>
