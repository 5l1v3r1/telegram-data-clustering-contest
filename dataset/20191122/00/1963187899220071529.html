      <p>RIYADH/VIENNA - 22 November 2019: Saudi Arabia affirmed that the Iranian regime's expansionist ideology and intervention in the region came at the expense of its people, SPA news agency reported Friday. <br/><br/>This came in a speech delivered by Saudi Ambassador to Austria and its governor to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Prince Abdullah bin Khalid bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz during the discussion of the item (Verification and Monitoring in the Islamic Republic of Iran in light of UN Security Council resolution 2231 of 2015). <br/><br/>The discussion was held at a session of the IAEA's Board of Governors, currently held in Vienna. <br/><br/>Prince Abdullah said the reports issued by the IAEA regarding Iran's violations of the nuclear agreement at the level of uranium enrichment, the quantity produced from it, the installation of advanced centrifuges, the suspension of all its research and development obligations, and its recent uranium enrichment at the Fordow facility, are a threat to the international community. <br/><br/>He said they confirm the inadequacy of the nuclear agreement with Iran and reinforce doubts about the intentions and peacefulness of its nuclear program, stressing that Iran has used the economic return of the nuclear agreement in provoking internal unrest in neighboring countries, in light of its insistence on developing ballistic missiles and supporting terrorist groups in the region. <br/><br/>Prince Abdullah said the Kingdom welcomed the contents of the joint ministerial statement of the three European parties to the agreement and the High Representative of the European Union, lauding the US decision to end the exemption of Iran's Fordow nuclear facility from sanctions as of December 15, 2019. <br/><br/>The ambassador also affirmed Saudi Arabia's call for not tolerating Iran's apparent blackmail and defiance of the international community as a whole, calling on the IAEA to continue its monitoring efforts in Iran to uncover further information related to its nuclear activities and any other sites Tehran is likely to use in this regard, while keeping the council informed</p>
