      <p>Aside from perhaps the week between Christmas and New Year’s Day, this is the best time of the year in which to buy a new vehicle. Automakers are rolling out special Black Friday sales incentives virtually across the board to lure consumers into showrooms who may already be in a spending mood. You should also expect dealerships to further sweeten the deals with generous discounts."Black Friday is historically one of the biggest car-shopping events of the year, but this year the holiday weekend is also hitting right at the end of November, which is creating a perfect storm of savings for new-car shoppers," says Jeremy Acevedo, senior manager of insights with Edmunds.com. "Automakers and dealers are going to be extremely motivated to clear out lingering 2019 model-year vehicles and hit their end-of-month sales goals, so shoppers can expect some great discounts."</p>
      <p>The best rebate, lease, and financing deals we’re listing below are indeed being offered on 2019 models, and most are good through the end of the month. On the down side, that means you may not be able to find your ideal combination of colors and features for a given model sitting on a dealer’s lot.</p>
      <p>For its part, Buick is taking between 13-21 percent off the sticker prices of select 2019 inventory as part of its Black Friday promotion. That comes to a nearly $8,000 discount on the top version of the Regal TourX midsize wagon. Likewise, Chevrolet and GMC are slashing 20 percent off the top on most 2019 models. That comes to a total price reduction of nearly $10,000 on either a Chevy Traverse Premier three-row crossover or a GMC Sierra 1500 SLE Crew Cab pickup truck.</p>
      <p>Dodge is again offering $10 per horsepower cash-back offers on its 2019 Challenger coupe and Charger sedan muscle cars. That means a $3,420 rebate on base V6 models, running all the way up to a whopping $7,970 on the 797-horsepower Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye.</p>
      <p>Kia is offering up to $6,000 cash back or zero percent financing with up to $2,000 cash back on select 2019 models. Their discounted lease offers are equally attractive. And while most luxury brands tend to offer lease and financing promotions instead of rebates, Lexus bucks the trend this month with generous cash back offers as generous as $7,500.</p>
      <p>Note that that automakers’ incentives often vary by region to address local supply an demand issues, so be sure to check a manufacturer’s website to see what’s being offered where you live. Also, additional cash rebates may be granted to members of the military, first responders, and students or recent graduates. But take heed that low-rate financing programs and lease deals like the ones featured here are only available to borrowers who have top-tier credit scores.  </p>
