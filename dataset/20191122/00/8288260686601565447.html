      <h1>The world's biggest Toblerone is the sweetest deal in Amazon's Black Friday sale</h1>
      <h2>The 4.5kg chocolate bar has been reduced on the first day of the Amazon Black Friday sale</h2>

      <p>Amazon has announced the full details of its Black Friday sale and one discount it sure to be a hit with people with a sweet tooth.</p>
      <p>The online retail giant has announced it is cutting the price of the <a href="https://amzn.to/35phHPw">huge 4.5kg bar of Toblerone</a> - the biggest Toblerone money can buy.</p>
      <p>The giant treat was previously listed at £75 bit Amazon has cut the price of the chunky chocolate to just £45, which represents a saving of £29.</p>
      <p>The bar is approximately 80cm long and was previously spotted on shelves of budget store Home Bargains. However, Amazon's deal undercuts the retailer's original price of £50.</p>
      <p>It still may be a little steep even for the biggest chocolate fans. After the bars first appeared on shelves one customer said: ""Who in their right mind would pay that amount for a chocolate bar, especially a cheap one like that."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Another added: "You want your head looking at if you're gonna spend £50 on chocolate".</p>
      <p>It seems Amazon's cost-cutting chocolate deal may not be too popular with bargain hunters. However, the retailer has also announced a host of other deals for the first day of the Amazon Black Friday sale on 22 November.</p>
      <p>Amazon has cut the price of its <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/amazon-launches-amazing-deal-echo-17294230">Echo Dot</a> , <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/amazon-unveils-huge-black-friday-17296028">Firestick</a> and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/amazon-drop-prices-across-kindles-17294334">Kindle devices</a> to new lower prices on the first of the eight days of deals.</p>
      <p>Other discounts include a 55-inch Phillips Smart TV for just £509, a saving of £240 on the original price of £749.</p>
      <p>The sale is live now and will take place for the next eight days before Black Friday itself on 29 November. There will be further discounts on Cyber Monday on 2 December.</p>
