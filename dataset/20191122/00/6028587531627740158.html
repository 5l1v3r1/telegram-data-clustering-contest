      <p><i>The Mandalorian </i>continues to be one of my favorite TV shows right now, and one of my favorite new <i>Star Wars </i>properties.In Episode 3 ‘The Sin’ Mando (Pedro Pescal) takes The Child (baby Yoda) back to the planet where he got the bounty in the first place. We’re still not sure what any of these planets are actually named since there are never title cards or spoken references to location.</p>
      <p>I wondered last week if we were on Tatooine thanks to the Jawas which, as far as anyone knew, were native to that planet. But the description of Kuiil (Nick Nolte) the moisture farmer who helps Mando out in the first two episodes, <a href="https://www.starwars.com/databank/kuiil">says he’s from Arvala-7</a>.</p>
      <p>In any case, Mando and The Child return to the bounty hunter planet and Mando takes his bounty directly back to The Client (Werner Herzog) where he’s given a sizable bounty in Beskar steel, the special steel taken from Mandalore, which the Mandalorians use in their armor.</p>

      <p>Mando takes the payment and then asks The Client what they plan to do with the kid. The Client reminds him that it’s none of his business. That his guild isn’t allowed to ask questions once they accept a contract and take payment, and so Mando takes his money and leaves.</p>
      <p>We see The Child taken from the room, looking sadly back at Mando and it’s heartbreaking.</p>
      <p>Mando heads back to the basement where he last met with The Armorer (Emily Swallow) with about ten times the amount of Beskar steel he brought her last time. She decides to forge him a cuirass–a breastplate/backplate combo–which he takes as a “great honor.”</p>
      <p>She also fashions him whistling birds, a small fleet of tiny rockets that attach to his suit. The remaining Beskar is donated to the Foundlings, something near and dear to Mando’s heart, since he himself was once one.</p>

      <p>Mando goes back to the bounty hunter cantina where he meets once again with Greef Karga (Carl Weathers). Karga is the guy who hands out contracts, and has some sort of leadership role in the bounty hunter’s guild. He’s pleased with Mando, having earned a cut of the Beskar steel himself.</p>
      <p>We learn that pretty much every bounty hunter in the parsec was given the same bounty to find the baby Yoda, and everyone is bitter at Mando for getting the catch. Everyone except Karga who wants to celebrate with Mando–take him to the pleasure houses or get him some drugs, that sort of thing.</p>
      <p>Mando just wants a new bounty, and is given one. It’s a Mon Calamari like Admiral Ackbar, and may in fact be his son. (There are rumor’s his son will show up in <i>Rise Of Skywalker</i>). Mando takes the bounty, heads back to his ship and prepares to leave, but not before asking Karga what they’re going to do with the kid. Karga reminds him that it’s none of their business. “Get high and forget all about it,” he says, though I’m paraphrasing.</p>
      <p>But Mando can’t forget. He sits there in his ship, and even with his helmet on we can tell the struggle he’s going through, imagining what they’re doing with the kid. When he notices the little ball on the top of the joystick that the Child had taken off, he powers back down and leaves the ship.</p>
      <p>What follows is yet another master class action sequence. Mando returns to the building where he left The Child and takes out about twenty or so Stormtroopers. He uses a variety of methods: Blaster, his little vibrating knife, his bare hands, his blowtorch and eventually the whistling birds. It’s a great sequence, and it’s here that I start to think “This is reminding me of <i>John Wick.</i>”</p>
      <p>That comparison only grows stronger once Mando finds the kid. He’s in a room with Dr. Pershing (Omid Abtahi), the only one there that seems like a halfway decent person. He pleads for his life, telling Mando that it’s only because of his intervention that the baby still lives–something Mando knows to be true since he spied on them earlier with his sweet <i>Far Cry binoculars </i>rifle.</p>

      <p>Mando takes the baby and leaves, and as soon as he does, every single bounty hunter fob in the city goes off. This is really where <i>John Wick </i>clicked for me. Here we have a member of a bounty hunter’s guild (kind of like John Wick’s guild of assassins) going rogue and suddenly finding that every one of his professional colleagues is hunting him down. I get the feeling that much of the rest of this season will follow this story, with Mando on the run and dangerous bounty hunters at his heels.</p>
      <p>So one great action sequence becomes two, with Mando doing his best to blast his way out of the city to his ship against insurmountable odds. His rifle–which vaporizes everything it hits–helps to level the playing field, but there are still too many of them, and all seems lost. Karga has lost his good humor by this point, telling Mando that they’re going to kill him and take the bounty, and not sounding too shook up about it, either.</p>
      <p>Then the other Mandalorians show up. We met them in the Armorer scene, where we learned just how bitter these people were toward the Empire. Indeed, Mando and a large Mandalorian almost get in a fight at one point, but they all show up to help their brother out of his fix, and he makes the escape to his ship while the others hold off the bounty hunters.</p>
      <p>Karga almost gets him at this point, but Mando gets the better of him and leaves him for dead. The Beskar steel in Karga’s shirt pocket saves his life, however, which is bad news for our hero.</p>

      <p>Off they fly, Mando and The Child, side by side once again. The Child reaches for the ball and this time, Mando obliges him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Verdict</b>
      </p>
      <p>This was another fantastic episode. I love how it feels like a space Western and I love the similarities to <i>John Wick, </i>one of my very favorite action franchises right now. Both are also similar in their lack of dialogue. There’s simply very little speaking in <i>The Mandalorian.</i></p>
      <p>Instead, visual storytelling reigns supreme. Not just in the action sequences, but in all the small details and world-building. The music, also, remains some of the best on TV. It’s actually grown on me considerably, which is surprising only because I liked it so much to begin with.</p>
      <p>The Child is so stinking adorable, too. I found myself more than a little stressed out when Mando turned him over, and cheering when he decided to go back even though he knew it meant he’d break with the guild and become a wanted man.</p>
      <p>It’s just an incredible production in every way. The backstory of the Mandalorian people is fascinating. The action sequences are among the best in any <i>Star Wars </i>production. And I’m dying to know what happens next.</p>
