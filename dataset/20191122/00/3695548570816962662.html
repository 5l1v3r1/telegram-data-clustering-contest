        <b>Ferrari needs to clarify what is "silly" with Formula 1 drivers Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel following their crash last weekend, but is not interested in repeating Mercedes' past tactics.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After a season that featured tense moments with team orders, Vettel and Leclerc came to blows late in the Brazilian Grand Prix in a collision that took both out of the race.</p>
      <p>Team principal Mattia Binotto declared the accident "silly" post-race and is now focused on avoiding a repeat, but dismissed replicating the "rules of engagement" Mercedes employed with its warring pair of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg a few years ago.</p>
      <p>"I don't know what Toto [Wolff, Mercedes boss] did," said Binotto.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to judge. I'm not interested as well.</p>
      <p>"But certainly we need to clarify with who is in the team, what is silly and what's not.</p>

      <p>"We are at the limit of the actions. But when you have a crash, something was wrong, no doubt.</p>
      <p>"When you're free to fight, you're free to fight and it's only a driving matter how much you can take as a risk.</p>
      <p>"But certainly here the risk was not necessary."</p>
      <p>Binotto has been keen to manage his drivers this season by employing team orders when deemed necessary and allowing them to race on other occasions.</p>
      <p>They had made contact prior to the Brazilian GP, although that was a minor, harmless incident at the start of the Mexican GP when Vettel nerfed the rear of Leclerc on the first lap.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Leclerc's arrival at Ferrari has appeared to destabilise four-time world champion Vettel at times, and Binotto suggested the team could have handled the new pairing differently this year.</p>
      <p>He was due to meet with his drivers at the team's headquarters in Maranello this week.</p>
      <p>"There is always something you can do better," said Binotto. "But certainly [in Brazil] the mistake was the mistake of the drivers.</p>
      <p>"What as a team could we have done better? Not in the heat [of the moment will Ferrari react], but we will think.</p>
      <p>"Certainly we need to improve that for the future and that's not to happen anymore."</p>
