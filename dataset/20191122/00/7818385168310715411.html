      <p>There are two types of people in this world—those people who love to shop and those who cannot stand it. Whether you like shopping or not, it often comes with some annoyances, like having to stand in line to try on a shirt or having it delivered directly to your home only to find it does not fit.</p>
      <p>Ahead of Black Friday, here are six Israel-linked companies aiming to make shopping much easier and a lot more fun</p>

      <p>After filling a large cart with consumable often half melting goods, nobody likes to stand in line for checkout at the supermarket. Shopping automation startup Trigo Vision Ltd. helps you bypass the line. The company’s technology uses in-store ceiling-mounted cameras to identify items picked up by customers and automatically charge them as they leave the store. Last month, the company announced London-listed supermarket chain Tesco PLC will integrate Trigo’s technology into its app letting registered customers using the Tesco app will be able to purchase products without having to use the check-out counter. Tesco has raised $29 million, not including Tesco’s investment.</p>
