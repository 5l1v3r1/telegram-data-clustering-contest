      <p>Startups will take centre stage at next year’s <a href="https://www.globalfoodsummit.com/">Global Food Summit</a> in Munich. Up for grabs is the event’s prestigious Audience Award. For a chance of winning that – and the opportunity to pitch to influential investors and stakeholders – startups must first be nominated, and then choose to apply to pitch at the summit next March. Eight startups will be selected by a panel of experts to progress to the final. <a href="https://www.globalfoodsummit.com/call_for_startup.php?lang=en">Who would you recommend?</a></p>
      <p>The Global Food Summit is sponsored by the University of California, Berkeley, Wageningen University in the Netherlands, the German Academy of Science and Engineering (acatech), the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the Bavarian State Government, represented by the Food Cluster, Bavaria. The 2020 edition will be held in the Munich Residenz from 25 to 26 March.</p>
