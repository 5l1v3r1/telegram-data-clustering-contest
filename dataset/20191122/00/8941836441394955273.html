      <p>NAPLES, Fla. (AP) - A Florida man got 20 years in prison for a hit-and-run crash that killed a 13-year-old.</p>
      <p>The Naples Daily News reports that 35-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pedro-silva-diaz/">Pedro Silva-Diaz</a> was sentenced Thursday after being convicted of leaving the scene of a crash involving death and driving without a license causing death.</p>
      <p>Authorities say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pedro-silva-diaz/">Silva-Diaz</a> was driving on an East Naples road in November 2017 when his vehicle struck Shayden Colvin’s bicycle. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pedro-silva-diaz/">Silva-Diaz</a> was found and arrested that night. The boy died the next morning.</p>
      <p>A June trial for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pedro-silva-diaz/">Silva-Diaz</a> ended in a mistrial after jurors couldn’t reach a decision.</p>
