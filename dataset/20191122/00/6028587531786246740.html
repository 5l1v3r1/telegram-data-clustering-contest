      <h1>Holiday Gift Guide 2019: The Best Plant-Based Meal Delivery Kits</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Spenser Mestel</a></address>
      <p>No meat, no fish, no seafood, no problem. Even though many of the following companies offer a full menu of foods, including fare for omnivores, they all have fully plant-based offerings that will leave you stuffed and satisfied. Plus, almost every meal available can be cooked in 30 minutes or fewer. So, whether you’re a lifelong vegan or just looking to incorporate more lean protein, whole grains, and fresh vegetables into your diet, this is a convenient way to expand your plant-based pallet. <a href="https://www.purplecarrot.com/">Purple Carrot</a></p>

      <p>Purple Carrot does nothing but plant-based meals, either in portions for two people or for six, and their menu is a thrilling combination of traditional vegetarian staples (like hot and sour soup with mustard greens and crispy tofu) and fare that may be a little less familiar (like panko-crusted tempeh with lemon zucchini soba and avocado).</p>

      <p>Unlike Purple Carrot, Green Chef also offers meat-inclusive plans (keto, paleo, and balanced living), but that doesn’t mean their “plant-powered” kit isn’t delicious, filling, and creative. Soon, you’ll be an expert at including produce that you may have been a stranger to before, like adding chard and artichoke to your quesadillas.</p>

      <p>No matter the dietary needs of your home, Sun Basket has you covered with its ten types of meal kits: carb-conscious, paleo, Mediterranean, lean and clean, gluten-free, quick and easy, chef’s choice, diabetes-friendly, pescatarian, and vegetarian (though not vegan). Regardless of the plan you choose, all the food is USDA-certified organic, and the plant-based offerings are guaranteed to be high in protein and fiber.</p>

      <p>If you’re new to the plant-based lifestyle, Blue Apron may be the best way to transition away from meat, as you’re probably already familiar with their vegetarian meals, like the Muffuletta-style grilled cheese with pear and romaine salad. And, if you like a glass of vino with dinner, Blue Apron also delivers wine.</p>

      <p>If you have children (and therefore need your plant-based meals to be as convenient as possible), Yumble is a good choice. Technically, you aren’t cooking. You’re microwaving, but with these kid-friendly staples, which always include a vegetable, at least you know that dinner will go smoothly (at least the food part, anyway).</p>

      <p>If your cooking style is less let’s-carefully-follow-the–recipe and more I’m-a–food-mad-scientist, Hungry Root is perfect for you. You tell the company what you do and don’t like, and then they send you groceries with suggested recipes, allowing you to . mix and match and experiment however you like.</p>

      <p>If you really don’t need the guidance of a recipe, consider Misfits, a delivery service that connects you with delicious, fresh produce that would otherwise be thrown out because it’s misshapen, lumpy, too small, not yet fully ripe, or has cosmetic blemishes. In exchange for accepting this aesthetically unusual food, you’ll get up to 40% off the store price.</p>

      <p>Imperfect Foods operates on the same model as Misfits – delivering perfectly good food that is in danger of being discarded – but they don’t just deal in produce. Your box might also contain scarred almonds, oversized eggs, and surplus coffee, all for a discount of up to 30%. Operating in 25 cities, the company has already saved 86 million pounds of food waste.</p>
