      <p>LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) - The athletic department at the University of Kansas is reporting a profit after two straight years of financial losses.</p>
      <p>The Lawrence Journal-World obtained the auditor’s report for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-athletics-inc/">Kansas Athletics Inc.</a>, a nonprofit corporation wholly owned by the university. It shows operating income of $4.3 million for fiscal year 2019. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-athletics-inc/">Kansas Athletics</a> had an operating loss of $82,000 in fiscal year 2017 and an operating loss of $1.6 million in fiscal year 2018.</p>
      <p>Operating revenue - everything from ticket sales to contributions - rose 11 percent, to $114.7 million. Operating expenditures also grew, but not as much as revenues.</p>
      <p>The newspaper says much of the new spending went to the football program. Athletic Director Jeff Long, who began his job in August 2018, started a fundraising drive to boost football spending.</p>
