      <h1>Fani-Kayode Attacks Ahmed Lawan For Declaring All Buhari’s Request Good For Nigeria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Enioluwa Adeniyi</a></address>
      <p>The minister of Aviation under the Goodluck Jonathan Administration, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/femi-fani-kayode/"><u><b>Femi Fani-Kayode</b></u></a>, has described the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/ahmed-lawan/"><u><b>Ahmed Lawan</b></u></a>-led senate as a rubber stamp assembly.</p>
      <p>The former minister stated this while reacting to the statement by the Senate President that any request from President Muhammadu Buhari is good for Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Lawan had <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/22/any-request-from-president-buhari-good-for-nigeria-lawan/"><u>stated this</u></a></b> during a courtesy visit by Itse Sagay at his office on Thursday, <b>Naija News</b> recalls.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I want to assure you that any request that comes from Mr President is a request that will make Nigeria a better place in terms of appointments or legislation and the senate will act expeditiously to ensure that we play our part in the confirmation or passing of legislation appropriately.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“As far as we are concerned, those bills will have to come again and start to go through the process from the very beginning.”</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“We are ready, in fact, we are in haste if those bills are ready for us to start working on them,”</i> he had said.</p>
      <p>Fani-Kayode who took to his Twitter account wrote, <i>“Any request from Buhari is good for the nation. We will act on it – Senate President Shuaibu Lawan.”</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Consider the implications of the Senate President’s words. The National Assembly is meant to act as a check and balance to the power of the executive and not as a rubber stamp!”</i>
