      <p>National Chairman of the People’s National Convention (PNC), Bernard Mornah’s declaration that the party is voting NO at the December 17 referendum was not sanctioned by the party, the leader of the PNC has clarified.<br/><br/>“The National Executive Committee(NEC) of the People’s National Convention wishes to inform the general public that it has not taken any stance on the impending referendum,” Dr Edward Nasigrie Mahama, Leader of the PNC said in a statement on Thursday.<br/><br/>Bernard Mornah had said the PNC decided to back the NO campaign claiming introducing partisan politics at the district assemblies and unit committee level would among others make Ghana’s democracy more expensive than it already is.<br/><br/>But Dr Mahama said that position was personal and doesn’t represent the position of the PNC.<br/><br/>“The National Chairman of the Party, Mr Bernard Mornah has no powers to singlehandedly decide for the party on such a matter. It is only the NEC that can take such a conclusive decision.”<br/><br/>He admonished members of the party against prioritizing their interest over that of the party which he said is “bigger than any individual”.<br/><br/>“The public is, hereby, advised to ignore any position from any quarters other than that of NEC of the party which is scheduled to meet soon and deal with the issue.”<br/><br/>Earlier on Thursday, National Youth Organiser of the PNC Awudu Ishaq issued a statement to express his displeasure about the “loud silence” of the party on national issues including the referendum.<br/><br/>Urging the Leader of the party to rally leadership of the PNC to discharge their mandate, he asked the party to state its position on the upcoming referendum.<br/><br/>Dr Mahama indirectly responded to his concern, hinting of a possible YES vote.<br/><br/>“The PNC at the moment is focused on the reorganization of the party from the grassroots level to National and would not wish to jeopardise any opportunity that has the potency to revamp the party at the grassroots level especially where we have a larger following,” he said.<br/>The upcoming referendum seeks to amend Article 55/3 and would need at least 40 per cent of voters voting in the referendum and 75 per cent must back the amendment for it to pass.
