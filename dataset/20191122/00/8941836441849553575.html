      <p>KITTERY, Maine (AP) - The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is breaking ground on a pair of major projects.</p>
      <p>One is a $61.7 million Paint, Blast and Rubber Facility that comprise more than 65,000 square feet. The other is a $17.3 million consolidated warehouse comprising about 29,000 square feet.</p>
      <p>Officials said those are key projects aimed at making the shipyard more efficient. The shipyard overhauls and repairs nuclear-powered submarines for the Navy.</p>
      <p>Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire are expected to attend the event Friday morning in Kittery, Maine.</p>
