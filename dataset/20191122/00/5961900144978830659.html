      <h1>The Trailer For Jordan Peele’s Nazi Bashing Series ‘Hunters’ Is Here &amp; It Whips Ass</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:03:05+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:03</time> by <a rel="author">By Cam Tyeson</a></address>
      <p>Even with just two feature films under his belt thus far, if anything lobs in front of you with the name <b>Jordan Peele </b>attached to it, it’s probably gonna be worth a watch. To wit, Amazon Prime officials have unfurled the first teaser trailer for the upcoming Nazi-murdering series <i>Hunters</i>, and it honestly looks like a right old time.</p>
      <p>The series, set in New York City in 1977, follows a “diverse band of Nazi hunters” who have discovered scores of high-ranking Nazi officials living among the public, who are all conspiring to establish a Fourth Reich in the United States.</p>
      <p>Peele is attached to the project as an executive producer, and the cast is headed up by the incomparable <b>Al Pacino</b>, who is featured heavily in the trailer which dropped earlier this morning.</p>
      <p>It looks good, mates. It looks real, real, <i>real </i>good.</p>

      <p>The extended cast also features the likes of <b>Logan Lerman</b>, <b>Kate Mulvaney</b>, <b>Tiffany Boone</b>, <b>Carol Kane</b>, and <b>Josh Radnor</b> pulling one hell of a Marc Maron impression with the thick mo and the printed collared shirt.</p>
      <p>The series is the brainchild of creator <b>David Weil</b>, whose previous work includes a re-write of the <i>Bird Box </i>script for Netflix, and a yet-to-be-produced feature script co-developed with <b>Darren Aronofsky</b>, the details of which are reportedly being kept under unusually tight lock and key.</p>
      <p>No word on any specific release date is available at present, but expect <i>Hunters </i>to land on Amazon Prime at some point in 2020.</p>
