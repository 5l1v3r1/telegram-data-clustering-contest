      <p>Everywhere you look, Eden Gardens is pink. Cricket murals adorn the walls around the iconic Kolkata-based stadium which has a giant-sized pink ball hanging over it. Famous landmarks in the historical city are tinged with pink and even pink-colored sweets are being sold. Quite clearly, Kolkata has embraced day-night Test cricket - a concept aimed at rejuvenating cricket’s longest and most treasured format by playing under lights and with a pink ball.</p>
      <p>India, cricket’s mighty powerhouse, has never played a pink ball Test - the only major Test nation along with Bangladesh never to do so. History will be made on Friday when the teams play in the second Test in Kolkata with India’s new look governing body changing its stance on day-night cricket.</p>

      <p>Just one year ago, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) rebuffed Cricket Australia’s (CA) bid for the series-opener in Adelaide to be a day-night blockbuster. It was the first time in four years the Adelaide Oval match reverted back to a traditional Test played with the red ball during the day.</p>
      <p>Crowd numbers in Adelaide were significantly lower than the three previous day-night Tests. India’s reluctance was understandable considering pioneers Australia had won all four of their day-night matches (it later won a fifth against Sri Lanka in Brisbane).</p>
      <p>Ultimately, it was the right move for India who won a nail biter in Adelaide spring boarding it to a historic 2-1 triumph over an undermanned Australia. India had never previously won a Test series Down Under.</p>
      <p>Next week’s Adelaide Test between Australia and Pakistan will revert back to the day-night spectacle. And Perth next month will host its first day-night Test when Australia and New Zealand open the three-match series.</p>

      <p>India’s change of heart can be attributed to its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tristanlavalette/2019/10/24/new-indian-cricket-president-sourav-ganguly-takes-charge-in-fresh-start-for-embattled-governing-body/#6edf9f274a28">new president</a> Sourav Ganguly being an advocate for day-night Tests and making it a priority when he took the top job last month. The former India captain had introduced pink ball cricket at the domestic level as the technical committee chairman three years ago.</p>
      <p>The concept has been popular in Australia and sparked record crowds in Adelaide and Brisbane. Enthusiasm, however, has been tempered elsewhere with England’s governing body going cold on the format. Edgbaston in Birmingham hosted a day-night Test against the West Indies in 2017 but England has not hosted another.</p>
      <p>England reportedly turned down an offer to play a day-night Test on its current tour of New Zealand.</p>
      <p>The concept appeared to be flagging but India’s sudden embrace could well be the tonic for day-night cricket to become regular in the fixtures. Cricket, of course, has fanatical support in India but attendances for Test cricket <a href="https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/opinion-test-cricket-will-need-to-be-spiced-up-for-its-survival-11571855352247.html">have been concerning</a> – a worrying trend worldwide bar in Australia and England.</p>
      <p>Ganguly said the first four days of the pink ball Test in Kolkata have been sold out.</p>
      <p>"I know in T20 every stand is full in every game. But proper management of Test cricket will bring back the crowd,” he said. “It's a start for India. I think with this concept Test cricket will be back on its feet.</p>
      <p>"Now people's lives have changed, you cannot leave offices so that's when you have to make adaptability. That's important. Most number of times change is good. A lot of time, we hold on to things thinking what you believe is right," he added.</p>

      <p>Ganguly, however, needed to convince Virat Kohli – the India captain who doubles as arguably the most influential figure in the game due to his mammoth stardom. He claims to have won him over instantly.</p>
      <p>“I met him for an hour and the first question was we need to have day-night Tests and the answer in three seconds was let's go ahead and do that," Ganguly said about his meeting with Kohli.</p>
      <p>Kohli said day-night cricket “had to happen”. “The thing was to experience the pink-ball Test in our own conditions first, so you get the hang of how the ball behaves, what is the way to sight the ball and so on,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Then, eventually, going and playing with the pink ball anywhere in the world.”</p>
      <p>The developments will be welcome to CA with India scheduled to tour next Australian summer. No announcement has been made on the fixtures but CA will undoubtedly be keen to finally mark down the Adelaide Test as a pink ball blockbuster contest.</p>
      <p>Kohli, ominously, though was still wary. "I don't think (it will become the norm) in five-six years," he said. "In my opinion, this should not become the only way Test cricket is played because then you're losing that nervousness in the first session in the morning.</p>
      <p>“Yes, you can bring excitement into Test cricket but you can't purely make Test cricket based on just entertaining people."</p>
      <p>All eyes will be on a pink-tinged Kolkata over the coming days - and nights.</p>
