        <b>The World Health Organisation has found in a major study that globally only one in five adolescents moves enough daily to prevent detrimental effects on their health.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.afp.com/en/news/3954/get-moving-four-five-adolescents-dont-exercise-enough-who-doc-1me55l2">French news agency AFP reports</a> on Friday, November 22, that in its first ever report on global trends for adolescent physical activity, the UN health agency stressed that urgent action was needed to get teens off their screens and moving more.</p>
      <p>«We absolutely need to do more or we will be looking at a very bleak health picture for these adolescents,» study co-author Leanne Riley commented to journalists ahead of the launch.</p>
      <p>The report, which was published in the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(19)30323-2/fulltext">Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health journal</a>, is based on data from surveys conducted between 2001 and 2016 of some 1.6 million students between the ages of 11 and 17 across 146 nations.</p>
      <p>It found that 81 percent did not meet the WHO advice of at least an hour a day of physical activity such as walking, playing, riding a bike or taking part in organised sporting activities.</p>
      <p>This was deemed worrying, since regular physical activity provides a host of health benefits, from improved heart and respiratory fitness to better cognitive function, making learning easier, according to WTO.</p>
