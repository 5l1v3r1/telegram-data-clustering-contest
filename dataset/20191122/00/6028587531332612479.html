      <h1>‘The Witcher’ On Netflix Drops Episode Titles And Some Plot Hints</h1>

      <p>I believe I’ve seen shows do similar things to this in the past, but this feels exceptionally well done. Netflix is gradually building hype for its new series, <i>The Witcher</i>, based on the Andrzej Sapkowski novels that most outside of Poland know through CD Projekt Red’s series of RPGs. We’ve had little hints about what it’s going to be about, but this is both the biggest one and something totally devoid of information: the perfect tease. Netflix just dropped all of the episode titles, complete with a little poem for each. There’s a whole series of these on Twitter, but we can just look at them down below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The End's Beginning</b> - "A monster slain, a butcher named."</li>
        <li><b>Four Marks </b>- "We look at a sorceress's earlier days."</li>
        <li><b>Betrayer Moon</b> - "A picky eater, a family shamed."</li>
        <li><b>Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials </b>- "The Law of Surprise is how one repays."</li>
        <li><b>Bottled Appetites </b>- "A fateful meeting, a bard is maimed."</li>
        <li><b>Rare Species</b> - "The hunt for a dragon is underway."</li>
        <li><b>Before a Fall</b> - "A return to before a kingdom is flamed."</li>
        <li><b>Much More</b> - "The Witcher Family as you all like to say."</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So again: good luck actually figuring out what’s going on based on these. But we can certainly glean some information. “The Witcher Family” as the poem for the last episode reminds us that this show will emphasize the relationship between Ciri and Geralt, as did <i>The Witcher 3</i>. And “A bard is maimed” almost certainly refers to some sort of scrape that Dandelion gets into, and it seems like episode 2 is going to be based around backstory for Yennefer. Also: there will be a dragon, and I get the feeling that said Dragon is going to be one of the big set-pieces for the show.</p>
      <p>Also, it seems that a monster will be slain. Spoiler warning!</p>
      <p>and then there’s the title of the last episode, again, not a surprise, but a fun one to see: “Much More”. Netflix has never been one to let a successful project lie, and <i>The Witcher</i> has already been renewed for a second season. The source material here lends itself well for continuing, episodic adventures, and “Much More” just makes me think about Ciri, Geralt and Roach, one adventure down and ready to take on as many new ones as the format will allow. Man, do I hope this thing works.</p>
