      <h1>José Mourinho Offers to Be Spurs Players' Girlfriends in Bizarre Opening Speech to New Squad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/14401747" target="_blank">Tom Gott</a></address>
      <p>​José Mourinho attempted to win over his new Tottenham Hotspur squad this week by giving them a passionate speech, in which he offered to be each player's father <i>and</i> girlfriend, in an attempt to turn around their poor form.</p>
      <p>Former boss Mauricio Pochettino was sacked after seeing Spurs fall to 14th in the Premier League, but the club are hoping for an immediate recovery when they travel to face bitter rivals West Ham on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Mourinho has been tasked with being the man to rebuild <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/tottenham">​Spurs</a>, and <a href="https://www.record.pt/internacional/paises/inglaterra/detalhe/mourinho-abana-balneario-do-tottenham?ref=Tottenham_DestaquesPrincipais">​Record</a> note that he won over many in the squad as a result of his...<i>bizarre</i> opening speech.</p>
      <p>"I will be your father, friend, girlfriend...whatever you want," Mourinho joked, after laughing about his previous comments from his time with <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/chelsea">​Chelsea</a>, when he insisted that he could never manage Spurs because of his love for the Blues.</p>
      <p>Despite the odd nature of his words, it seems as though they had the desired impact as the squad began to see him as the kind of person who is committed to putting their miserable run of form to an end.</p>

      <p>Mourinho also spoke personally with a number of influential figures in the squad, including Hugo Lloris, <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/harry-kane">​Harry Kane</a> and <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/dele-alli">​Dele Alli</a>, to try and get to the bottom of Spurs' recent collapse.</p>
      <p>He also spoke to contract rebels <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/toby-alderweireld">​Toby Alderweireld</a> and <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/christian-eriksen">​Christian Eriksen</a> to let them know of his plans for the team. The two players will both be free to discuss contracts with overseas teams in January, but it is thought that Mourinho would be <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6501472-jose-mourinho-adamant-harry-kane-must-not-be-sold-as-he-opens-door-to-spurs-contract-rebels">​open to letting them stay</a>.</p>

      <p>Both Alderweireld and Eriksen are believed to be intrigued by the idea of working with Mourinho, and so is Jan Vertonghen, who could opt to sign a new deal to extend his stay at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
      <p>Mourinho's overall goal is to make Spurs feel like a close-knit family once more, and he hopes that the increase in optimism will steer the team to victory against <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/west-ham">​West Ham</a> on Saturday.</p>
