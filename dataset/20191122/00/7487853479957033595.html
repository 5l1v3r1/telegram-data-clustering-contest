      <h1>Alternative Table Shows How Premier League Would Look This Season Without VAR</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/14534390" target="_blank">Robbie Copeland</a></address>
      <p>VAR hasn't been particularly well-received in the Premier League to say the least, but at the top of the league, it seems it isn't having as much of an impact as you would think. </p>
      <p>That's according to an alternative Premier League table, anyway, which calculates the hypothetical points totals across the division's 240 games so far this season - taking the technology out of the picture.</p>

      <p><a href="http://90min.com/teams/liverpool">Liverpool</a> have been labelled LiVARpool by social media's resident banter-merchants, an homage to the apparent favourable treatment they've received from the officials in the VAR room. The algorithm, however - as devised by <a href="https://games.paddypower.com/">Paddy Power Games</a> - predicts that their 34-point total would remain unchanged.</p>
      <p>Their lead over <a href="http://90min.com/teams/manchester-city">​Manchester City</a> would be cut to just seven points, however, since City would be two points better off if the technology wasn't in play - so perhaps the Cityzens do have a case against it after all. </p>
      <p>In this alternative universe, <a href="http://90min.com/teams/chelsea">​Chelsea</a> and <a href="http://90min.com/teams/leicester">​Leicester</a> continue to make up the remainder of the top four, but with four points between them - since Chelsea would be a point better off, while the Foxes would lose four. </p>
      <p>Leicester's -4 point swing is the largest recorded, although <a href="http://90min.com/teams/everton">​Everton</a> would move up as many as six places into ninth, with the single point that VAR has allegedly cost them so far. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Spurs would be facing a relegation battle meanwhile, two points worse off than they are now in 16th, while <a href="http://90min.com/teams/crystal-palace">​Crystal Palace</a> drop five places into 17th, just behind them. </p>
      <p>The only teams unmoved outside of the current top four are <a href="http://90min.com/teams/sheff-utd">​Sheffield United</a>, who have been done out of as many as three points, and Watford, who would be no better or worse off. </p>
      <p>Below is the entire table, if that's your sort of thing.</p>
