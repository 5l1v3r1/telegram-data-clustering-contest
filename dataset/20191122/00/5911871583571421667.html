      <h1>Paul McCartney – “Home Tonight” &amp; “In A Hurry”</h1>

      <p>Paul McCartney is nowhere near slowing down. The 77-year-old former Beatle is <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2065217/paul-mccartney-will-headline-glastonbury-2020/news/">headlining Glastonbury</a> next year, and is also currently writing a musical adaptation of <i>It’s A Wonderful Life</i> that’s set to debut next year. Last year, he released <i><a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2012919/paul-mccartney-egypt-station-review/franchises/the-week-in-pop/">Egypt Station</a></i>, his 17th(!!!) solo studio album. Now, McCartney is sharing two new tracks, “Home Tonight” and “In A Hurry.” The songs are slated for physical release on Black Friday, which takes the form of a double A-side 7-inch Record Store Day exclusive, but we get to hear them ahead of time.</p>
      <p>Both songs were recorded with producer Greg Kurstin during the sessions for <i>Egypt Station</i>. “Home Tonight” is bit more true-to-form for McCartney. It’s quite jammy, features some brass and clapping, and methodically weaves guitar tones into this blissed-out, summery sentiment. “In A Hurry” is quite frenzied, expanding in a way that really soars. The opening utilizes this <i>Sgt. Peppers</i>-esque piano, but modernizes it with an asymmetrical synth that frazzles out during the bluesy guitar solo. There’s a hysterical “huh-huh-huh” choir of vocals in the buildup to the chorus, and I swear it sounds just like Tina Belcher from <i>Bob’s Burgers </i>hyperventilating. With that said, I can genuinely admit I like both of these songs.</p>
