      <p><b>Topline</b>: Scrutiny is piling on TikTok as the U.S. Army ordered a security assessment of the risks posed by military personnel using it, Army secretary Ryan McCarthy confirmed on Thursday, after a senior Democrat senator wrote a letter to him urging an investigation into the app’s use of data.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>McCarthy ordered the security assessment after the intervention from Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer on November 7.</li>
        <li>TikTok is owned by Chinese tech firm ByteDance and boasts more than 26 million monthly active users in the U.S., most of whom are aged between 16 and 24.</li>
        <li>The app is used to create short, easily shareable videos, typically set to music.</li>
        <li>Schumer voiced concerns over TikTok handled users’ personal data and Chinese laws that require local tech companies to “support and cooperate” with China’s intelligence agencies.</li>
        <li>Bytedance’s TikTok has been a breakout success story for China’s tech sector, which rarely produces apps that connect with international audiences but now faces becoming another pawn in the trade war between Washington and Beijing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: Last month, Schumer demanded the director of national intelligence <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/10/24/congress-worries-tiktok-is-a-national-security-threat/#29378ff836cd">investigate</a> the app in a separate letter.</p>
      <p>ByteDance has sought to <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/explaining-tiktoks-approach-in-the-us">assure</a> stakeholders that U.S. data is held and moderated in the United States, TikTok US general manager Vanessa Pappas wrote earlier this month. Earlier this year, Schumer asked the FBI and Federal Trade Commission to investigate Russian-owned photo editor FaceApp over privacy concerns. Last year, fitness app Strava inadvertently <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/01/29/strava-fitness-data-location-privacy-scare/#5a1c49f055c3">exposed</a> the locations of secret U.S. military bases.</p>
      <p><b>Tangent</b>: The U.S. military has turned to social media platforms like TikTok in recent years in a bid to reach young Americans and boost the number of recruits after it fell short of its target <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2018/10/09/army-target-22-cities-add-700-recruiters-boost-enlistments.html">last year</a>.</p>
