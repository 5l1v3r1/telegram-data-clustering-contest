      <p>Stephen Colbert was carried off the field after an 'intense' rugby lesson with two All Black greats during his recent trip here.</p>
      <p>T<i>he Late Show With Stephen Colbert</i> host was given a crash course in New Zealand's national game by former All Black Piri Weepu, former All Blacks Sevens captain DJ Forbes and NZME's Laura McGoldrick.</p>

      <p>First, the three experts ran him through the rules of rugby, including all the complex positions.</p>
      <p>"Okay, I didn't get all that..." Colbert joked after the explanation.</p>
      <p>Then he attempted to tackle Forbes, which despite early confidence - where the talk-show host exclaimed "You wanna call your mommy before this?" - didn't go to plan.</p>
      <p>Colbert is dedicating a section of his show - which he's calling The Newest Zealander - to his trip to Aotearoa every day this week.</p>
      <p>It was pretty intense - so intense, that he had to be carried from the field at the end of the training session.</p>

      <p>First up was the team's name, which comes from their all black kit.</p>
      <p>"We have a team in the United States called the 'all whites', and it's the Republican party," quipped the talk show host.</p>
      <p>But Colbert amazed everyone - including himself - when he nailed kicking a conversion from right in front of the posts.</p>
      <p>The week-long series, dubbed "New Zealand Week", chronicles Colbert's Kiwi adventures and features an interview with Ardern, rugby lessons with "legends from the All Blacks" and a tour of Wellington with comedian Bret McKenzie.</p>
      <p>In his opening of the show, Colbert explained why he was dedicating a whole week of his shows to New Zealand.</p>
      <p>"Trump's impeachment is really heating up - it's gearing up, it's ramping up," he said.</p>
      <p>"The fate of our nation hangs in the balance. That is why all week we will have complete coverage of my amazing trip to New Zealand."</p>
