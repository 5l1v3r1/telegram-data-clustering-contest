      <h1>SA Post Office backtracks on parcel delivery claim</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>The South African Post Office (SAPO) has backtracked on its claim that it <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/business/322366-sa-post-office-we-deliver-parcels-without-delays-or-problems.html"><b>delivers parcels without delays or problems</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The organisation said in a social media marketing campaign in October that it “delivers parcels efficiently and without delays with the margins of error reduced to zero percent”.</p>
      <p>This claim did not go down well with some consumers, and one of them lodged a complaint with the Advertising Regulatory Board (ARB).</p>
      <p>The complainant argued that it is impossible that the Post Office is delivering parcels with a 0% margin of error.</p>
      <p>The Post Office responded, saying a communication error occurred in the preparation of this social media post, resulting in the disputed claim.</p>
      <p>It added that the claim of delivering parcels without delays or problems has been removed from all social media feeds.</p>
      <p>The ARB was satisfied the Post Office’s response to remove all the social media posts addressed the complaint.</p>
      <h3>No Comment from Post Office</h3>
      <p>MyBroadband previously asked the SA Post Office for comment regarding this marketing campaign, but the company did not reply.</p>
