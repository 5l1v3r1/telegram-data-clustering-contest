      <h1>Hyatt to open first dual-branded Hyatt Place and Hyatt House property in Ho Chi Minh City</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Seher Asaf</a></address>
      <p>Hyatt is set to launch its first dual-branded Hyatt Place and Hyatt House hotel project in Southeast Asia with the opening of a new property in Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
      <p>Slated to open in 2023, this will mark the entry of the Hyatt House brand in Vietnam. The planned 69-story tower, housing both Hyatt Place Saigon and Hyatt House Saigon, will be one of the tallest buildings in Ho Chi Minh City, according to Hyatt. The 81-storey Vincom Landmark 81 is the tallest building in the city, and in Vietnam.</p>
      <p>The hotel group said Hyatt Place Saigon, District 7 will consist of 300 rooms, a café, a bar serving coffee and cocktails, a lobby lounge, and three meeting rooms, as well as an outdoor pool and fitness centre.</p>
      <p>Hyatt House Saigon, District 7 will cater to guests looking for longer term accommodations, and will consist of 250 rooms divided into studios and one-bedroom suites, a bar, a lobby lounge, one meeting room, as well as an outdoor pool and fitness centre.</p>
      <p>“District 7” refers to one of 24 districts in Ho Chi Minh City. These consist of 19 inner city districts and five suburban areas, some numbered and others named, according to English-language Vietnamese news website <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/features/vietnam-hanois-rise/">Vietcetera</a>.</p>
      <p>“The flashy, new high-end drag of Phu My Hung is what people most often associate with district seven. As you would expect from such a young, self-sustaining neighborhood, its draws a select, international crowd. Most street food and vending is banned in this area, allowing for cleaner, wider sidewalks,” Vietcetera reports.</p>
      <p>“It attracts families, foreigners and locals alike, projecting a completely different vibe than other parts of town. Life moves a bit slower here, and it’s packed with restaurants, leading international schools like Saigon South, coffee shops, bars and clinics. If you want to escape the fury of the inner city and are in need of more privacy, this might be the place to go.”</p>
      <p>David Udell, group president, Asia-Pacific, Hyatt Hotels, said: “Whether guests are looking for short term or extended stay accommodations, the location of Hyatt Place Saigon, District 7 and Hyatt House Saigon, District 7 will put them in the heart of an up-and-coming residential, commercial and entertainment district that is well connected to Ho Chi Minh City’s Central Business District.”</p>
      <p>The new property will be a part of Eco Green Saigon, a 34-acre mixed-use development, which will also include residential units, office space, event space, and a primary school. Eco Green Saigon is 13 kilometres from the Tan Son Nhat International Airport, five kilometres from District 1, Ho Chi Minh City’s Central Business District, and about two kilometres from the Phu My Hung New Urban Area comprising of office developments, high end residences and schools, as well as the Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre.</p>
      <p>There are about 300 Hyatt Place hotels worldwide. Hyatt said these are designed to “create an easy to navigate experience for today’s multi-tasking traveller”. Hyatt House hotels, on the other hand, offer apartment-style suites designed for extended stay residents, including World of Hyatt members, who are “seeking the conveniences of home”. Guests have access to services such as a free hot breakfast, H Bar with a Sip + Snack menu, and indoor and outdoor communal spaces. There are about 90 locations worldwide.</p>
