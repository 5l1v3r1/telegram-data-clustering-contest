      <p>After bowling Pakistan out for 240 on the first day, openers David Warner and Joe Burns led Australia's resounding reply. Only one wicket fell for the hosts as they ended the day with a lead of 72 runs with Warner still at the crease on 151*.</p>
      <p>The openers scored at a rate of over four runs per over in the first two sessions, subduing the threat the Pakistan bowlers had to offer. To the hosts' relief, Warner, who had a disappointing Ashes series earlier this year, struck form, scoring his first fifty-plus score in his last six Test innings. The flamboyant batsman did enjoy a fair slice of luck. First on 49, when Shaan Masood dropped a sharp chance at short leg and then on 56, just two overs into the second session, when he was caught behind off Naseem Shah but survived as the debuting teenager had overstepped.</p>

      <p>He again survived on 93 after a direct hit from Yasir Shah at deep mid-wicket had almost caught him short. But, luck was on the left-hander’s side and he soon notched up his 22nd Test century, reaching the triple-figure mark in the longest format after nearly two years. His 21st had come against England in December 2017 in Melbourne. </p>
      <p>The 33-year-old was also very alert in the field, twice involved in running four runs. He was ably supported by Burns, who looked shaky at the beginning but kept the scorecard ticking. Pakistan finally managed to get their long-awaited breakthrough in the first hour of the final session, when Yasir Shah’s change of angle worked and Burns was bowled around his legs, falling three runs short of what could have been his fifth Test ton. The first-wicket pair had racked up 222 runs, the fourth-highest opening stand at the Gabba. It was also their second double-century opening stand in Tests.</p>

      <p>Burns' wicket, however, did little to ruffle the hosts. Warner continued his charge with newcomer Marnus Labuschagne. After going past Pakistan’s total in no time, Australia crossed the 300-run mark with ease with Warner crossing 150 and Labuschagne getting his sixth Test fifty in the process.</p>
      <p>For Pakistan, their fast bowlers worked hard but failed to create any openings on a pitch that played true for the most part. Teenager Naseem Shah bowled with energy throughout and exhibited good control as well but could do little to stem the flow of runs.</p>
