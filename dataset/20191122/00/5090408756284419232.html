      <h3>Queen Elsa is voiced by Broadway icon Idina Menzel.</h3>

      <p>Idina Menzel provides the powerhouse vocals for Queen Elsa’s regular scenes in addition to the epic ballads she sings throughout both films.</p>
      <p>In “Frozen 2,” Elsa’s powers are tested as she ventures into an enchanted forest protected by the <a href="https://www.insider.com/frozen-2-element-symbols-explained-2019-9">spirits of water, earth, wind, and fire</a>. And no, Elsa doesn’t have <a href="https://www.insider.com/why-elsa-has-no-love-interest-frozen-2-2019-9">any sort of love interest (gay or otherwise)</a> in the second “Frozen” movie.</p>

      <h3>Young Elsa was voiced by Mattea Conforti.</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>“Frozen 2” opens with a flashback to a night when Anna and Elsa were much younger, before Elsa’s powers were made into a big secret. Actress Mattea Conforti provided the voice for that littler version of Elsa.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Princess Anna is played by Kristen Bell.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/11/11/5dd6e8d479d75717a03449d6.jpg"/>

      <p>Kristen Bell, currently the star of <a href="https://www.insider.com/shows-critics-loved-this-year-100-rotten-tomatoes-2019-11">NBC’s critically-acclaimed comedy “The Good Place,”</a> also does the singing for her character’s musical moments in “Frozen 2.”</p>
      <p>The sequel shows Anna confronting <a href="https://www.insider.com/kristen-bell-frozen-2-anna-kristoff-relationship-2019-10">the bumpy road of long-term relationships</a> as she and Kristoff try to figure out if “happily ever after” is a real thing.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Young Anna is voiced by Hadley Gannaway.</h3>
      <figure>

      <h3>King Agnarr is played by Alfred Molina.</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>In the first “Frozen” movie, Anna and Elsa’s father King Agnarr spoke only a handful of lines. Back then he was voiced by Maurice LaMarche.</p>
      <p>Now, in “Frozen 2,” actor Alfred Molina (“Spider-Man 2”) took over the role for the king’s expanded part in the flashbacks.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Queen Iduna is voiced by Evan Rachel Wood.</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Queen Iduna in “Frozen 2” and Evan Rachel Wood.<cite>Disney and Kevin Winter/Getty Images via Disney</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Like Agnarr, Queen Iduna was originally voiced by someone else in the first movie. It was actually the film’s cocreator and director Jennifer Lee who provided vocals back then (for Iduna’s sole line: “She’s ice cold”).</p>
      <p>Now “Westworld” star Evan Rachel Wood voices Queen Iduna in “Frozen 2,” and the actress sung the opening song for the movie as well (“All Is Found”).</p>

      <p>Ex-“Game of Thrones” actor Ciarán Hinds (who played Mance Rayder in the HBO show) is the voice of Pabbie. Hinds voiced Pabbie in the first movie, too.</p>
