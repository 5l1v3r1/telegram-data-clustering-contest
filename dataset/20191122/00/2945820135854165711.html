      <p>This 2019 MotoGP™ season has been breathtaking, with great races around the globe and has thereby inspired Tissot, the Official Timekeeper, to come back to its roots by adding some touches of red to next year’s watches. The number one Swiss traditional watch brand in terms of volume is looking forward to the next season with some stunning models that every aficionado of MotoGP™ will love to wear.</p>
      <p>Every watch from the MotoGP™ Collection illustrates both the qualities of the bikes themselves and those of the riders. They have the dynamic look and robust aspect of the bikes with details reflecting some of their features, from the counters all the way to footrest pushers. The precision and passion show the qualities of the riders. The ultimate accuracy is also proof of the high standard of timing that has been developed to over the years as Official Timekeeper of MotoGP™.</p>

      <p>In 2020, the MotoGP™ Collection will have two models in its standard collection: one quartz, limited to 4999 pieces and one automatic version limited to 3333 pieces. As always, Tissot also created some special and limited pieces for each of its Ambassadors such as Marc Marquez, Jorge Lorenzo and Thomas Lüthi.</p>
      <p>However, changes have been made, now the cases are in steel and the hands in red.</p>
      <p><b>François Thiébaud, Tissot President</b>: “We wanted to come back with some red on the 2020 MotoGP Collection as it is part of both brand’s DNA. These new versions are as modern as the motorcycles from which they are inspired. Tissot is already looking forward to celebrating the next eason with its longtime partner MotoGP with these great new products."</p>
      <p><b>Carmelo Ezpeleta, CEO of Dorna Sports</b>: "As the official timekeeper, TISSOT are a longstanding partner of MotoGP and it is always a pleasure to see the new collection revealed. This year is no different, with new pieces that once again celebrate the best of both TISSOT and our incredible sport. This new collection is the perfect way to celebrate both the longevity of our partnership and incredible racing still to come."</p>
