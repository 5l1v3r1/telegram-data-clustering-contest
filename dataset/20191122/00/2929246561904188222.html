      <p>England reduced New Zealand to 144/4 at the end of second day of the first Test after posting 353 in their first innings at the Bay Oval, Mount Maunganui.</p>

      <p>New Zealand's bowlers did well to bowl England out for 353 after Ben Stokes' 91 had carried the visitors to 277/4 at one stage but the home team's batsmen were unable to stitch up substantial partnerships.</p>
      <p>They got off to a shaky start, losing opener Tom Latham early for just 8. Latham, was adjudged LBW off Sam Curran’s bowling in the eighth over. The left-hander did not opt for a review but replays later suggested that he may have got an inside edge. Opener Jeet Raval then shared a 54-run stand with skipper Kane Williamson, with the latter doing the bulk of the scoring.</p>

      <p>New Zealand’s troubles, however, were far from over. Jack Leach dismissed Raval on 19, breaking the half-century stand in the third session, after which they could only manage small partnerships. The top-scorer of England’s innings Ben Stokes got the key wicket of the experienced Ross Taylor for 25 even as Williamson continued to fight at the other end. The New Zealand skipper scored his 31st Test fifty, but was undone the very next ball as Curran got one to rear up sharply and Williamson gloved it to Stokes at second slip.</p>
      <p>Nicholls and Watling then dropped anchor to hold on. Nicholls, in particular, was subject to vicious short-pitched bowling from Jofra Archer late in the day and even copped a blow to the helmet at one point. However, the 28-year-old was alright to see the day off without further damage.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, England who resumed batting on 241/4 added another 112 runs to the total and were bowled out for 353. Stokes and Ollie Pope started the day confidently, with Stokes leading the charge. The partnership soon crossed 50 runs and just when it looked like England were taking the game away, a stupendous right-handed grab from Taylor at first slip off Tim Southee sent Stokes back to the pavilion, triggering a mini-collapse.</p>

      <p>Southee then dismissed Pope and Sam Curran off back-to-back deliveries. Newcomer Archer survived the hat-trick ball but fell tamely in the next over to Trent Boult. Having lost four wickets for 18 runs, England had slipped to 295/8 but Jos Buttler's experience came to their rescue and his 70-ball 43 ensured that the visitors crossed the 350-mark.</p>
      <p>Southee was the pick of the New Zealand bowlers with four scalps, while Neil Wagner and Colin de Grandhomme took three and two wickets, respectively.</p>
