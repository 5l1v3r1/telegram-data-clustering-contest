      <p>Elite SPG commandos protect the prime minister and his/her immediate family, former prime ministers and their immediate family for a certain period depending on the threat perception.</p>
      <p>While listing out the government's business for next week in Lok Sabha, Meghwal said besides other bills, the SPG (Amendment) Bill will also be introduced.</p>
      <p>According to official sources, family members of former prime ministers will not be guarded by the elite SPG commandos, as per the amendments approved by the Union cabinet.</p>
      <p>This comes days after the government withdrew the SPG protection given to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her children, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, after almost three decades.</p>
