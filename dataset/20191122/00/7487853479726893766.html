      <h1>Why England Need to Switch to a Back 3 Formation to Have a Chance of Winning Euro 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15276264" target="_blank">James Cormack</a></address>
      <p>​Remember the World Cup? You know, the thing that galvanised a nation for a whole summer and saw England 22 minutes away from their first major final since 1966. Yeah, that.</p>
      <p>And no, it shouldn't be Kieran Trippier's set-pieces, Harry Kane's Golden Boot or Gareth Southgate's waistcoat that are credited for England's success. Instead, Southgate's bold switch to a back three just months before the tournament was ultimately the key in the Three Lions' unforgettable journey.</p>
      <p>Ok, I get it, it wasn't <i>all</i> Southgate's switch, but it played a part, and for England to taste glory at next summer's Euros - a tournament that's getting us England fans a wee bit excited - Southgate has to revert to a similar system they used in Russia.</p>

      <p>During the World Cup campaign, England deployed a 3-1-4-2 - a formation they first used in a friendly against Holland in March 2018, although they had played with a back three in the final qualifier against Lithuania a few months prior. </p>
      <p>Back then, Liverpool's Jordan Henderson was used as the number six in front of a central-defence that was made up of Manchester City pair <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/kyle-walker">Kyle Walker</a> and <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/john-stones">John Stones</a>, while Harry Maguire filled the other spot. At wing-back, Ashley Young was generally favoured over Danny Rose on the left and <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/kieran-trippier">Kieran Trippier</a> was the firm number one choice on the right.</p>
      <p>This left Jesse Lingard and Dele Alli as two attack-minded number eights in front of Henderson, while <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/harry-kane">Kane</a> and <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/raheem-sterling">Raheem Sterling</a> were utilised as split-strikers (*insert 'If only Kane had squared it to Sterling' tweet*).</p>
      <p>Let it go, people, an offside in the build-up would've ruled it out anyway.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, Southgate's setup helped the Three Lions massively, especially going forward. While in previous tournaments England often looked pedestrian in the final third, in Russia they were free-flowing and ruthless - scoring 13 goals in six games (excluding the third-place play-off because who cares). It was a breath of fresh air to see an England side play this sort of football on the biggest stage, under the shiniest lights. Horrors of Capello's suffer-ball in 2010 and Iceland's 'Viking Thunder Clap' at Euro 2016 were quickly forgotten.</p>
      <p>Defensively, they were stout-ish, conceding six times but managing to keep just one clean sheet - that coming in the quarter-final victory over Sweden.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Ever since that magical month in Russia, Southgate has favoured a more dynamic 4-3-3 for his England side - often with a holding midfielder and two number eights.</p>
      <p>To begin with, it looked great, England topping their UEFA Nations League group while securing a historic win against Spain in the process. The victory, in which the Three Lions were simply unstoppable in transition, highlighted that we weren't just competing with the 'big boys', we were bettering them as well.</p>
      <p>But recent qualifiers - most notably the games in the Czech Republic and the two against Kosovo - as well as the Nations League semi-final against Holland, showed that the current 4-3-3 simply won't work in a major tournament.</p>
      <p>Why? Well, it's pretty simple - England don't have a defensive midfielder who's competent at an international level. Declan Rice, who best fits the profile for this role, has been exposed many a time in an England shirt. In possession, the 20-year-old is the definition of safe - often reluctant to turn out and play despite space behind him and opting for a safer 'bounce' back to a defender instead. </p>
      <p>Off-the ball, Rice has great defensive instincts - he reads the game well, tackles well and intercepts well - but operating in a single pivot, his lack of speed often allows opponents to exploit the space either side of him - as pointed out by <a href="https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2019/10/21/marco-silva-admits-everton-targeted-declan-rice-on-saturday/">Marco Silva</a> after Everton's 2-0 win over the Hammers last month.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fczech-republic-v-england-uefa-euro-2020-qualifier-5dd6a4e58317e232ff000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8954248366013071&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.024943977591036413&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>In the aforementioned games, Rice started all four, and here's the shot count for the opposing teams: Holland - 29 (14 on target), Czech Republic - 17 and Kosovo - 20 (combined). </p>
      <p>While this doesn't paint the whole picture, from watching these games it's pretty clear that the <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/west-ham">West Ham</a> man doesn't do a good enough job at protecting the back four. Talented, yes, but Rice isn't quite ready to compete against Europe's best.</p>
      <p>Right, so where does that leave us? With no suitable options for that role - unless Jose Mourinho transforms <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/eric-dier">Eric Dier</a> into the player he once was in 2016 - it's pretty clear as day that England shouldn't play with a defensive midfielder at next summer's tournament. </p>
      <p>So what should Southgate do? Keep the 4-3-3 but bring in a number 10 instead of a number six? Potentially. But the return to a back three makes too much sense with the personnel the England boss will likely have available to him.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>This time, there will be no need for a makeshift centre-back in Kyle Walker, Southgate has three defenders at his disposal that could fit the system perfectly. That trio being Fikayo Tomori, Harry Maguire and Tyrone Mings.</p>
      <p>21-year-old Tomori has shone in a <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/chelsea">Chelsea</a> shirt this season, gaining crucial <a href="https://www.90min.com/categories/champions-league">Champions League</a> experience along the way. After making his debut in Kosovo, Tomori's a player that has to be in Southgate's plans going forward - potentially slotting in nicely on the right side of the three. </p>
      <p>Alongside him, <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/harry-maguire">Maguire</a> - England's best defender who made a name for himself at the World Cup - and Mings, who has been superb for <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/aston-villa">Aston Villa</a> up to this point and hasn't looked out of place by any means when he's played for the national team. Being left-footed, it would make sense for Mings to play on the left of the three, giving him more opportunity to progress play with his favoured foot - something he enjoys to do with his smooth passing ability.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The speed of Tomori and Mings will be crucial in a back three as they'll be forced to cover a<i> lot </i>of space left by advancing wing-backs. It's this attribute that sets the duo apart from other options. So, with the way things are heading, Stones should be on the outside looking in, while Michael Keane... actually, let's not go there.</p>
      <p>Whose space will they be covering? Well, it's pretty simple really, it has to be <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/trent-alexandar-arnold">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> and Ben Chilwell.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fengland-media-access-5dd6a57b8317e21e65000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8888888888888888&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.05904761904761905&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Rose's demise has left Chilwell as the clear number one on the left flank, with the <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/leicester">Leicester</a> man enjoying another fine season at the King Power and impressing in recent outings for the Three Lions. The 22-year-old is a fine defender but loves affecting play in the final third - as we saw against Montenegro. </p>
      <p>On the other side, Alexander-Arnold, despite his club form suggesting he's one of the best in Europe at his position, hasn't been Southgate's clear-cut favourite, with Trippier getting plenty of opportunities as well. And it's fair to say the Liverpudlian hasn't looked at his best when representing the national side, as he's faced the harsh reality that it won't be Joel Matip, Virgil van Dijk or Fabinho covering for his deep surges into opposition territory.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The 21-year-old has looked restricted at times in a back four, but playing higher up as a wing-back should give him the freedom to wreak havoc with his incredible crossing ability.</p>
      <p>Then, instead of using a 'six' as Southgate did in Russia, two box-to-box, tenacious number 'eights' in <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/jordan-henderson">Henderson</a> and Harry Winks - or possibly Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - should suit this England side more. Both have proven to be competent defenders while being good enough in possession to cause a problem going forward. Experience and superb showings in Europe's elite competition for their club sides will also prove pivotal at next summer's tournament.</p>
      <p>With the defence and midfield sorted, you then have the luxury to do what you want with the front-three. </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Southgate could make it a 3-4-3 and use the trio he's favoured for much of 2019 - Kane, Sterling and Jadon Sancho, but that could leave the midfield duo with little protection. A better option may be a 3-5-2 with James Maddison, Mason Mount or <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/dele-alli">De​le Alli</a> (if Mourinho can work his magic on attacking midfielders once more) utilised as an advanced midfielder - supplying the duo up top when in possession, while making it a midfield three out of it.</p>
      <p>While the right system is up for debate, there's no doubt that this is the most talented England squad since the 'Golden Generation' that criminally, never won anything. A squad blessed with exciting youth and elite veterans, unlike others before them, this England side look like they love playing with one another.</p>
      <p>And what's exciting is that the recent World Cup was only the start of the second potential English 'Golden Generation' of the 21st century.</p>
