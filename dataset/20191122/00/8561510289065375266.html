      <h1>Cyberattack Forces Hospital to Revert to Handwriting Everything</h1>

      <h3>Write and Wrong</h3>
      <p>On Friday, hackers attacked the University Hospital Centre (CHU) in Rouen, France, rendering the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50503841">facility’s computers unusable</a>.</p>
      <p>But instead of paying the ransom the cyberattackers demanded, staff at the 1,300-bed hospital reverted to using the “good old method of paper and pencil,” Remi Heym, CHU’s head of communications, <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/sante/article/2019/11/17/le-chu-de-rouen-perturbe-par-une-attaque-informatique_6019491_1651302.html">told the <i>Agence France-Presse</i></a>.</p>
      <h3>Waiting Room</h3>
      <p>Heym also told the <i>AFP</i> that the cyberattack caused “very long delays in care.” However, CHU wrote in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CHURouen/posts/3013687298645628?__tn__=-R">Facebook post</a> that the disruption did not endanger any patients, nor did it result in the leaking of any medical or personal data.</p>
      <p>French police have launched a formal investigation into the cyberattack, and the hospital expects to have all of its computing systems up and running again by this weekend.</p>
      <h3>Pay Up</h3>
      <p>CHU isn’t the first hospital to <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/cybersecurity/6-hospitals-health-systems-report-cyberattacks-in-the-past-30-days.html">fend off</a> a cyberattack. But because it’s located in a larger city, CHU had the option of refusing to meet the attacker’s demands — it could send patients to a nearby hospital if necessary while it sorted out the computer issue.</p>
      <p>Not every hospital has that luxury, though, and until the entire healthcare industry makes <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/cybersecurity-healthcare-executives">cybersecurity a top priority</a>, hospitals will likely continue to find themselves on the receiving ends of attacks — with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/06/hosptial-ceo-forced-to-pay-hackers-in-bitcoin-now-teaches-others.html">patients’ lives</a> potentially hanging in the balance.</p>
