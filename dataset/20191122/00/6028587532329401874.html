      <p>When popular romance author Robyn Carr went to visit the set of <a href="https://www.Netflix.com/virginriver"><i>Virgin River</i></a>, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2019/11/21/everything-coming-to-netflix-in-december-2019---and-what-to-watch/">new Netflix series</a> based on her bestselling series, she wasn’t sure what to expect. She had envisioned the town in her mind’s eye for years as she wrote the series, starting with <a href="https://www.robyncarr.com/book/virgin-river/">book one</a> in 2007 and going through the most recent, book 20 in 2018.</p>
      <p>The Las Vegas author wondered what she’d say if the reality didn’t quite match the fantasy version in her head.</p>
      <p>“It was shocking, wonderful, anxiety-provoking,” she says of going to the Vancouver set. “I was very nervous about seeing everything. I wondered, what if I don’t like it, do I say anything? When I got there, the crew and cast were as shy about it as I was. They kept saying, ‘Does it look like you thought?’”</p>
      <p>Carr needn’t have worried. “Luckily, honestly, I can say it was even better than I’d imagined. It was pretty cool,” she says.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80240027"><i>Virgin River trailer</i></a> dropped today previewing the new romance show, which will be released Dec. 6 on Netflix in 190 countries. The cast includes Alexandra Breckenridge from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcberman1/2019/09/25/this-is-uson-nbc-jumps-the-shark-in-season-4-opener/#105adcce4f4e"><i>This Is Us</i></a>, who plays a nurse named Melinda who comes to the town of Virgin River to escape a troubling past, and Martin Henderson from <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>, who plays Jack, a former marine and bar owner who becomes involved with Melinda<i>.</i></p>
      <p>Carr’s set visit lasted two days, and she had a chance to talk to the actors about their roles and see several scenes be shot. She even got her own director’s chair.</p>
      <p>She came away from the production excited to see some additions to her vision—she loved the pool table in Jack’s bar, for instance—and thrilled about the chemistry between her main characters, which was exactly what she’d hoped for.</p>

      <p>Carr also gained appreciation for what an undertaking the entire production was.</p>
      <p>“These people work hard, they work long days. I left after two days thinking, ‘I put 400 people to work.’ That’s amazing,” she says of the cast and crew.</p>
      <p>The set visit served as a crash course in TV shooting, too. “I hadn’t thought about the fact that they redo scenes over and over and over—not to make them better, but to shoot at different angles,” Carr says. “They want to see the back view, the face, the side view. Then those are all incorporated during the editing. I never thought of that.”</p>
      <p>Carr did occasional phone consultations throughout the shoot of the first season with showrunner Sue Tenney and one of the executive producers, Roma Roth, to ensure the series stayed true to the <i>Virgin River</i> universe. But Carr was also open to new ideas.</p>
      <p>“They came up with some new ideas and storylines, some of which I found myself saying, ‘Damn, I wish I’d thought about that. That’s a pretty good angle, it’s innovative,’” Carr says.</p>
