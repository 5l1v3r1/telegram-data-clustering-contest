      <p>Foreign residents will be slapped with a higher rate of stamp duty than UK home-owners under a Conservative government, as part of efforts to tackle the country’s housing crisis.</p>
      <p>A three per cent surcharge will be levied on companies as well as individuals buying property who are not UK tax residents, the Tories will announce today.</p>

      <p>The revenues raised from this new tax – estimated to be around £120m a year – will be used to tackle homelessness.</p>
      <p>A recent study showed that 13 per cent of new London homes were bought by non-residents between 2014 and 2016.</p>
      <p>Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, said: “Evidence shows that by adding significant amounts of demand to limited housing supply, purchases by non-residents inflate house prices. That is why we are introducing a higher rate of stamp duty for non-UK residents that will help to address this issue .</p>
      <p>“Britain will always be open to people coming to live, work, and build a life in this great country. The steps we are taking will ensure that more people have the opportunity of a great place to live and build a family.”</p>
      <p>Yesterday the Tories revealed plans to introduce a new mortgage with long-term fixed rates, with only a five per cent deposit, in a bid to help renters buy their first homes.</p>
      <p>The Tories will also create a scheme where local first-time buyers will be able to get a 30 per cent discount on new homes in their area.</p>
      <p>But plans to tinker with the mortgage market has raised eyebrows among some commentators.</p>
      <p>Torsten Bell, chief executive of Resolution Foundation, said: “It’s a massive deal if they’re overruling the Bank of England on regulation or getting on the nationalisation bandwagon with state-backed mortgages.”</p>
