      <p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - Iranian authorities slowly eased up their sweeping blockage of internet access on Friday, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iranians/">Iranians</a> to send the U.S. videos “documenting the regime’s crackdown” on protesters.</p>
      <p>“The U.S. will expose and sanction the abuses,” Pompeo tweeted early Friday, as pockets of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> saw internet over landlines restored.</p>
      <p>Authorities have said the internet may be entirely restored soon, suggesting <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a>’s government put down the demonstrations that began Nov. 15 over government-set gasoline prices rising.</p>
      <p>Amnesty International said Tuesday that protest unrest and a subsequent security crackdown killed at least 106 people. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> disputes that figure without offering its own. A U.N. office earlier said it feared the unrest may have killed “a significant number of people.”</p>
      <p>The jump in gasoline prices represents yet another burden on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iranians/">Iranians</a> who have suffered through a painful currency collapse. That’s a result of the reimposition of crippling U.S. economic sanctions as part of President Donald Trump’s maximum pressure campaign against Tehran, following his unilateral withdrawal of the U.S. from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a>’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a>’s relatively moderate President Hassan Rouhani has promised the fuel price increase will fund new subsidies for poor families. Rouhani declared victory Wednesday in the unrest, blaming “the Zionists and Americans” for the violence.</p>
      <p>Abolhassan Firoozabadi, the secretary of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a>’s Supreme Cyberspace Council, told journalists Thursday that he believed the internet would be turned on “within the next two days.”</p>
      <p>Authorities restored internet service Thursday in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a>’s Hormozgan province, home to the port city of Bandar Abbas, the state-run IRNA news agency report. Semiofficial news agencies said service was being restored in other parts of the country on Thursday afternoon, something the internet watchdog NetBlocks also noted.</p>
      <p>“At the current time national connectivity has risen further to 10%,” NetBlocks said in a tweet.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a>’s state TV said Friday that air defense exercises were being carried out as part of its annual military drills. State TV showed footage of air defense missile systems being fired and a patrol by jet fighters in the northern Semnan province.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> operates a domestically built air defense system alongside the sophisticated S-300 defense system from Russia. In June, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> shot down an unmanned U.S. drone over the strategic Strait of Hormuz for alleged violation of its airspace.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, activists said Thursday that six conservationists working to save the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah have been sentenced to prison on internationally criticized espionage charges in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a>.</p>
        <p>The New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran said Thursday that the convicted members of the nonprofit Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation face six to 10 years in prison for “contacts with the U.S. enemy state.” The conservationists found themselves arrested over their use of camera traps to track the cheetahs, a common tool of wildlife experts.</p>
