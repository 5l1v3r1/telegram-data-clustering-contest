      <h1>Another batch of Huawei Mate X devices sells out in seconds</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=32" target="_blank">Yordan</a></address>
      <p>Huawei finally brought the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_mate_x-9605.php">Mate X</a> to the Chinese market last week and all the available units were <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_mate_x_arrives_for_sale_and_promptly_sells_out_in_a_matter_of_minutes-news-40111.php">sold in under five minutes</a>, the company boasted on social media. It immediately scheduled another flash sale for today, and just as expected, the foldable phone was once again sold out, this time in less than 60 seconds.</p>

      <p>The Huawei Mate X has a 8” screen that folds to transform it into a dual-screen device with a 6.6” diagonal on the front and 6.38” 21:9 secondary display on the back. It has Kirin 980 chipset, but at least comes with the Balong 5000 modem that allows 5G connectivity.</p>
      <p>Rumors suggest the next-gen Mate X might have a stylus, tucked into the big frame, as well as Kirin 990 chipset, which is the current flagship SoC by Huawei’s chipset division HiSilicon.</p>
