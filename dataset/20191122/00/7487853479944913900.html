      <h1>Premier League Fantasy Football: Who's Hot and Who's Not in Gameweek 13</h1>

      <p>​We made it.</p>
      <p>After three international breaks in three months, English football fans are treated to non-stop domestic action until March.</p>
      <p>In the end, the recent break wasn't all so bad. England and Wales booked their places at Euro 2020 while the two Irish teams were forced to settle for the playoffs. Not only that, but we were also blessed with the huge news of Mauricio Pochettino's sacking from Spurs and the hiring of ze 'Special One'. So, the last few days have been fairly interesting.</p>

      <p>If gameweek 13 wasn't already highly-anticipated enough with the clash between Manchester City and Chelsea on Saturday, the return of Jose has made it one of the most intriguing weekends of Premier League football in a long time.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, let's take a plunge into the Fantasy Football world once more and analyse who's hot and who's not for what has the makings of a fascinating gameweek.</p>

      <h3>Goalkeepers</h3>

      <p>
        <b>
          <u>Who's Hot</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Ben Foster -</b> Despite the Hornets only recently climbing off the foot of the table, it's fair to say that they've been defensively sound for a while now. With Foster in net, they've conceded just three times in five games - keeping three clean sheets in the process. Up next for Watford is a Burnley side who've scored just six of their 17 Premier League goals away from home.</p>
      <p><b>Orjan Nyland -</b> This is a little bit of a risk as there is a chance that Tom Heaton could line up in goal for <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/aston-villa">Aston Villa</a> on Monday night. However, the £4.3m investment in Nyland, who's Villa's third-choice keeper, could prove to be a tidy one for this week. While the Villans haven't exactly been stout defensively this season, they're coming up against the third-worst attacking outfit in Newcastle on Monday, so there's certainly a chance for Villa to bag their first clean sheet since the 0-0 stalemate with West Ham on matchday five.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>Who's Not</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Dean Henderson -</b> Henderson has been superb for the Blades thus far and bar a couple of costly errors, the 22-year-old has been key in Sheffield United's superb defensive record. This week, however, Henderson won't find himself between the sticks as he's not allowed to take part against his parent club <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">Manchester United</a> on Sunday.</p>

      <h3>Defenders</h3>

        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fsheffield-united-v-burnley-fc-premier-league-5dd7d4ac727cd97b4800001f.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8888888888888888&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.11047619047619048&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>Who's Hot</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>John Lundstram -</b> If you're in the 58% majority that still hasn't added this box-to-box midfielder to your squad, add him ASAP. Lundstram, a 'defender' in the FPL world has racked up 70 points this season as a result of his three goals and the Blades' five clean sheets up to this point. The 25-year-old is key when <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/sheff-utd">Sheffield United</a> go forward, often finding himself in fantastic positions at the back post - as we saw against Burnley where he scored a brace. This investment simply can't be advocated enough.</p>
      <p><b>Caglar Soyuncu -</b> While <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/leicester">Leicester</a> have been so good to watch going forward this season, defensively they hold the best record in the division and the Turkish international has been a big reason why. The Foxes haven't conceded in their last three and have proven to be just as stout when they play away from the King Power. In all honesty, any of the Foxes' starting four could've made it, but Soyuncu's tame £4.9m price is what sets him apart from his teammates.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>Who's Not</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Andy Robertson - </b>Another risky call, but Robertson is a major doubt for Liverpool's trip to Selhurst Park on Saturday with an ankle injury. The Scotsman withdrew from international duty due to the problem and despite taking part in 'partial training' with the <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/liverpool">Liverpool</a> squad today, there's no indication that the left-back will play any part against <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/palace">Crystal Palace</a>.</p>

      <h3>Midfielders</h3>

        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Feverton-fc-v-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-5dd7d4758317e25691000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.923747276688453&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.07521942110177404&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>

      <p>
        <b>
          <u>Who's Hot</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Dele Alli -</b> It's fair to say that the appointment of Mourinho has a lot to do with this. In the past, the Portuguese coach has worked with number tens expertly well. Whether it be with Wesley Sneijder at <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/inter">Inter</a>, Deco at Porto or Mesut Ozil at <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a>, Mourinho has a proven track record in ensuring that whoever plays there excels and Dele is set to become the next beneficiary. The 23-year-old had started to show glimpses of a return to his best prior to Poch's departure, with both of his goals this season coming in the last four games. It's time for Mourinho to work his magic once more, and it starts at the London Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p><b>James Maddison - </b>After making his England debut against Montenegro last Thursday, Maddison missed the trip to Kosovo with a calf issue, but Brendan Rodgers has confirmed that the 22-year-old will be fit for <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/brighton">Brighton</a> on Saturday. The attacking midfielder has been in fine form of late - scoring two and setting up one in his last three outings for the Foxes and you can expect his form to continue over the coming weeks with Leicester's favourable fixture list.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>Who's Not</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Ryan Fraser -</b> After finishing second to Eden Hazard in the <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">Premier League</a> assists chart last season with 14, Fraser has struggled for form with the Cherries this season. So far, the Scotsman has made just three goal contributions and has failed to find the back of the net since his strike against <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/everton">Everton</a> on matchday five. With future ventures in the 25-year-old's mind, this is not the Ryan Fraser we saw last season, not anywhere close.</p>

      <h3>Forwards</h3>

      <p>
        <b>
          <u>Who's Hot</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Marcus Rashford - </b>The return of Anthony Martial has certainly freed up Rashford, who's moved out wide with the Frenchman playing as United's number nine. Since Martial's return, Rashford has two goals and an assist in three Premier League games and overall, he looks to be finding his best form once more. His displays for England over the break showed the confidence he's playing with at the moment - scoring and shining in the rout over Montenegro, while also finding himself on the scoresheet in the Kosovo victory as well.</p>
      <p><b>Gerard Deulofeu -</b> After making 15 goal contributions last season, Deulofeu failed to find the back of the net in the Hornets' opening ten fixtures. However, the Spaniard has scored in his last two and he looks like the man that <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/watford">Watford</a> will be relying on if they want to stay up this season. Upcoming for Deulofeu is a <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/burnley">Burnley</a> side that have failed to keep a clean sheet away from home thus far and <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/southampton">Southampton</a>, who boast the worst defensive record in the league.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>Who's Not</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Sebastien Haller - </b>The Frenchman enjoyed a fine start to life in the Premier League but has certainly gone off the boil in recent weeks as West Ham have struggled as a unit. Haller has gone four games without a goal and has scored just one in his last eight. It's fair to say that if his creators aren't cooking on gas, neither is he. Not only that, but things don't exactly get much easier for Haller either, with <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/west-ham">West Ham</a> facing Spurs, Chelsea, Palace and Leicester over the next month or so.</p>
