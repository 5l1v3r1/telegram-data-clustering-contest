        <b>Maurizio Sarri confirmed in a press conference prior to Juventus' game at Atalanta that there is a 99% chance Cristiano Ronaldo will not play. The Portuguese told his coach that he has a knock which he picked up in Portugal's game with Luxembourg.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The star was once again on everyone's lips not long ago <b>after getting angry about getting substituted</b> in the match with AC Milan. Everything seemed to have calmed down in Serie A<b>, but it looks like  he will not be on the pitch</b> at least for the next match. </p>
      <p>"The problem is that on Tuesday, in the meeting with <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/c-ronaldo-28185">Cristiano</a>, the guy told us that, in the second match with Portugal,<b> he picked up a knock which he had in the last few weeks</b>. We have established a plan and the aim is for him to be fit for the Champions League match with Atletico Madrid," the coach explained. </p>
      <p>"<b>There's a 99% chance he will not play tomorrow.</b> The substitution against AC Milan? There is no problem, it's good to let players cool down," the coach added. <b>The Portuguese is expected to be fully recovered </b>for the European match. </p>
