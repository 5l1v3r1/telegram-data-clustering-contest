      <h1>Euro 2020 Playoff Draw - Scotland, Northern Ireland &amp; Republic of Ireland Discover Opponents</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/1719980" target="_blank">Jamie Spencer</a></address>
      <p>Scotland must navigate a playoff semi-final tie against Israel and then a playoff final against ether Norway or Serbia if they are to reach Euro 2020 and play at what would be their first major international tournament since 1998.</p>
      <p>The Scots missed out on a place at next summer’s competition via the usual qualifying group, but a playoff place was awarded for their performance in the UEFA Nations League last season.</p>

      <p>In total, four remaining places at Euro 2020 are up for grabs through these second chance playoffs, one representing each of the Nations League tiers A-D.</p>
      <p>Scotland are in Path C, but Northern Ireland and Republic Ireland are in Path B – the neighbours could even meet each other in the Path B final if both win their respective semi-final ties.</p>
      <p>As a result of all bar Iceland from last season's Nations League A qualifying automatically for Euro 2020, and a total of seven nations from Nations League C filling the places, three teams from Nations League C are entered into Path A instead – Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
      <p>Whichever country wins Path D will be heading to their first ever major international tournament, with Georgia, Belarus, North Macedonia and Kosovo battling it out.</p>

      <p>All semi-final ties will be played on 26 March, with each final scheduled for 31 March.</p>
      <p>The Euro 2020 group stage draw will take place on 30 November in Romania, four months before the playoffs take place. Despite the identity remaining unknown, the groups each playoff winner will go into has already been decided.</p>
      <p>If Scotland qualify, they are guaranteed to face England in Group D – a repeat of Euro '96 – as one of the many hosting nations. But whoever wins Path C will go into that group regardless.</p>
