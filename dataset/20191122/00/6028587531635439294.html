      <p>It’s the truth: if you’re looking for major savings on a video game console this Black Friday season, you’re not going to get it buying a Nintendo Switch. Microsoft and Sony might be enthusiastically slashing prices, but Nintendo doesn’t like to mess with its MSRP all that much, and that’s what we’re seeing in 2019 so far. That doesn’t mean there aren’t moderate savings to be had, however: about the best you’re going to do is to bundle a game with the thing, which is most definitely a savings. You’ll need to buy a game to use the thing, after all. And one of the best of those bundles, from Walmart, is actually available now. <a href="https://www.walmart.com/co/Nintendo-Switch-Console-with-Minecraft-Game/842043295?irgwc=1&amp;sourceid=imp_RQ32C5QvNxyJRo2wUx0Mo34QUkn1MvXRTUeA1Y0&amp;veh=aff&amp;wmlspartner=imp_1943169&amp;clickid=RQ32C5QvNxyJRo2wUx0Mo34QUkn1MvXRTUeA1Y0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;sourceid=imp_VWo3qRSsnxyJR9AwUx0Mo38SUkn15lWxyShJV80&amp;veh=aff&amp;wmlspartner=imp_1201867&amp;clickid=VWo3qRSsnxyJR9AwUx0Mo38SUkn15lWxyShJV80">If you head over to Walmart now, you can find a copy of <i>Minecraft</i> bundled with the Nintendo switch for $299, </a>which means you’re essentially getting the game for free, about a $30 savings, depending. That’s a good deal, though not quite up there with the upcoming Kohl’s deal that also nets you $90 in Kohl’s cash for a more significant savings.</p>
      <p>A key fact about this deal: at first glance it might not appear to be as much of a savings as the $299 <i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe </i>bundle that you’ll be seeing at various retailers throughout the next week. But it comes with a major bonus that you might not know about: those <i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe </i>bundles will get you an old model Switch–still good, but with a lower battery life. These <i>Minecraft</i> bundles appear to come with the newer model Switch and its increased battery life: you can tell based on the packaging. Less important if you play mainly docked, but significant for handheld players or anyone who at some point in the future might become a handheld player.</p>
      <p>If you are absolutely committed to buying a Nintendo Switch this Black Friday and know that you or a loved one wants <i>Minecraft</i>, I’d say jump on it. That loved one may well be a child, in which case they’re more likely to be playing handheld and the battery life will spare some tantrums.</p>
