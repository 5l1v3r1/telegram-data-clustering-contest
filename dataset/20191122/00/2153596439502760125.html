      <h1>How much money South Africans say they plan to spend on Black Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/author/staff-writer/" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>Professional services firm PwC has published a new survey looking at consumer behaviour over Black Friday and Cyber Monday in South Africa.</p>
      <p>The survey is based on a survey of 1,000 South African adults between 26 September and 4 October 2019.</p>
      <p>It found that consumers plan on spending 36% more this year versus 2018, with shoppers planning to spend an average of <b>R3,812</b> during Black Friday/Cyber Monday 2019.</p>
      <p>The majority (85%) of respondents said they intend to buy something or would consider it if there is a good enough deal.</p>
      <p>Six out of 10 consumers who are planning to spend the same or more than last year are trying to take advantage of savings on offer, while 43% of these shoppers are hoping that more retailers will have deals this year.</p>

      <p>PwC found that South Africans are suckers for a good special and the increasing frequency of discount campaigns are training consumers to buy on promotion.</p>
      <p>“Despite consumers indicating that it is not a good time to purchase durable goods, the most popular product categories during Black Friday/Cyber Monday 2019 will be durables like electrical equipment, technology goods, homewares, clothing, shoes and accessories,” it said.</p>
      <p>“However, food and drink are becoming increasingly important purchases on Black Friday/Cyber Monday, as this is the main place that households are trying to save money. Some 30% of shoppers placed the food and drink category in their top three.”</p>

      <p>While South Africans are largely excited about Black Friday, a number of consumers said that retailers need to step up in the way they service their customers during the big shopping day.</p>
      <p>“A great customer experience does not happen by accident and is not created overnight. It is the crown jewel of a carefully planned and executed customer strategy that knows who the customers are and what the retailer can do for them,” PwC said.</p>
      <p>Its data shows that the four key customer experience priorities include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Addressing crowds, physical and virtual queueing;</li>
        <li>Offering great deals and big discounts;</li>
        <li>Providing safety and security;</li>
        <li>Avoiding stock shortages.</li>
      </ul>
