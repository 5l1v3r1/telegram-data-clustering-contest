      <p>People are being told not to swim or eat shellfish at some Banks Peninsula beaches.</p>
      <p>The Canterbury District Health Board has issued a health warning after high levels of faecal bacteria found in the water at Takamatua Bay and Akaroa's main beach.</p>
      <p>Medical officer of health Alistair Humphrey said the water quality is not considered suitable for recreational use.</p>
      <p>“This includes swimming because of the risk to health from the bacteria and other pathogens,” said Dr Humphrey.</p>
      <p>He says shellfish must not be collected from these areas.</p>
      <p>If fish are eaten, remove the gut and liver and wash in clean water before cooking.</p>
      <p>Water contaminated by human or animal faecal matter may contain a range of disease-causing micro-organisms, such as viruses, bacteria and protozoa. </p>
      <p>“In most cases, the ill-health effects from exposure to contaminated water are minor and short-lived.</p>
      <p>"However, there is the potential for more serious diseases, such as hepatitis A or salmonella infection."</p>
      <p>Environment Canterbury will continue to monitor both beaches and the public will be advised of any changes in water quality.</p>
