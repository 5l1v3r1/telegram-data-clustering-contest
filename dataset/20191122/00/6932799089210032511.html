      <h1>The design of the Galaxy S11 will have people scratching their heads</h1>

        <b>A set of 360° renders of the Galaxy S11 produced by the ever-reliable OnLeaks have been published, and boy do they make for ugly viewing. While the renders are exquisitely produced, Samsung looks like it has combined the worst elements of the Note 10 and iPhone 11 Pro into an even less pleasing package.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks">OnLeaks</a> has returned to show the world what the Galaxy S11 will probably look like with another set of <a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1197833371516329985">360° 5K renders</a>. According to the leaker, the Galaxy S11 will measure 161.9 x 73.7 x 7.8 mm, to give you a sense of how large the device will be. Its rear-facing camera housing will extend an additional 1.1 mm from the back glass, though. Unsurprisingly, the Galaxy S11 will have a metal frame complementing the front and rear panels of glass.</p>
      <p>The renders, which OnLeaks typically bases on leaked CAD files, show the Galaxy S11 as having a more rounded chassis than the Note 10 series. However, <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s11-render-design-exclusive/">91 Mobiles</a> claims that its 6.3- to 6.7-inch display will have a flatter curvature than those of the Note 10 series.</p>
      <p>Samsung will apparently drop the headphone jack its next Galaxy S series, while it will centre the front-facing camera as it did on the Note 10 series. The Galaxy S11 will have an ultra-thin speaker grille at the top of the display as the Note 10 series does too.</p>
      <p>Moving to the back of the device is where the first questionable design decision appears. <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s11-render-design-exclusive/">91Mobiles</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1197833371516329985">OnLeaks</a> claim that Samsung will switch to a penta-camera rear-facing setup that it will arrange in an L shape. The South Korean company will also include a ToF sensor, which will sit adjacent to an LED flash. As the images below demonstrate, the Galaxy S11 will sport a rectangular rear-facing camera housing that puts those of the iPhone 11 and Pixel 4 series to shame.</p>
      <p>While five rear-facing cameras will bring improved versatility to the Galaxy S series, there must be a more aesthetically pleasing way of arranging them. In hindsight, the omission of the headphone jack on the Note 10 series probably marked the death of the port on Samsung flagships. Its removal on the Galaxy S11 remains as egregious as ever, in our opinion.</p>
