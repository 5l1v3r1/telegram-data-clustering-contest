      <p>In <b>Red Bull Salzburg's youth team</b>, he has already <b>scored two goals and got an assist</b> in only<b> 3 games</b> played. Figures that have led Barca to offer<b> 15 million euros for him.</b></p>
      <p><b>Adeyemi is Barcelona's most desired young star.</b> <b>Patrick Kluivert</b>, the director of Barcelona's youth squad, has been following him for months, but his possible incorporation into the squad could become difficult due to the interest from two English clubs.</p>
      <p>This Friday, the English press has been speaking about this supposed interest, stating that both teams will try to sign him in the winter transfer window. If they don't achieve this, they will wait until summer 2020, a date in which Barcelona will also be very attentive to.Â </p>
