      <h1>Raheem Sterling Responds to Fan Video That Wishes Injury Upon Him to Allow Riyad Mahrez Playing Time</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/14928490" target="_blank">Ross Kennerley</a></address>
      <p>​Raheem Sterling has responded to a video posted by an Algerian supporter that claims he wishes injury upon the forward in order to allow Riyad Mahrez more time in the Manchester City first team.</p>
      <p>The former Leicester winger has been limited to just eight league appearances this term, often coming on as a substitute, having failed to dislodge Sterling <i>or </i>Bernardo Silva in Pep Guardiola's front three setup. That said, the 28-year-old has still chipped in with two goals and three assists in the league this season.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/players/riyad-mahrez">​Mahrez</a> had been away on international duty with Algeria, where the video in question was filmed, and a fan present uploaded the clip onto ​Twitter in which he claimed he would like to see Mahrez's teammate injured soon, in turn granting the winger further game time.</p>
      <p>In the video, Mahrez refuses to comment on the fan's wishes, but <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/raheem-sterling">​Sterling</a> caught light of the post and duly responded on his <a href="https://twitter.com/sterling7/status/1197643742221615110">​official Twitter</a> by claiming (in French) 'that's not good' accompanied with a sad emoji. However, further down in the comments the England international did mention further: "U guys crazy but I like u anyway."</p>
      <p>Sterling spent the international break playing his part in the Three Lions qualifying automatically for next summer's European Championships, while Mahrez was with his own national side as they kicked off their qualifying campaign for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations.</p>

      <p>Starting their group stage campaign off with a bang, the forward featured as Algeria swept aside Zambia 5-0, before securing a narrow 1-0 away victory over Botswana in their second clash.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Sterling missed out on England's 7-0 success over Montenegro due to disciplinary issues, but returned to the starting lineup away at Kosovo as Gareth Southgate's men ran out 4-0 winners.</p>
      <p>Both players are back in club action for <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-city">​City</a> this weekend, however, as Guardiola's side host Chelsea on Saturday evening looking to bridge the gap between themselves and <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a> leaders Liverpool, which now stands at nine points after their defeat to Jurgen Klopp's side prior to the international break.</p>
