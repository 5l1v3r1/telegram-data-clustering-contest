      <h1>Hands-on promo clip of the foldable ThinkPad X1 will have many fans telling Lenovo to take their money</h1>

        <b>Lenovo has posted a promo clip of the foldable ThinkPad X1 on YouTube that was filmed at the company’s recent Tech World event. A rendered marketing video for the folding laptop was already released earlier this year, but this latest clip shows the actual device going through a thorough hands-on workout. The foldable PC looks impressive but is clearly in an unfinished state.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lenovo has already <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-reveals-prototype-foldable-ThinkPad-X1-laptop.420564.0.html">told</a> the world about the foldable ThinkPad X1, which it classified as the “world’s first foldable PC”. However, at the time all that was available to show off the device were some renders and a teaser video. Now a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIjS8LdOIQY">promo video</a> has been uploaded by the company that shows the real-world laptop being folded and manhandled at Lenovo Tech World 2019 – and the 13.3-incher certainly folds like a pro.</p>
      <p>The foldable Lenovo ThinkPad X1 was officially unveiled in China by Yang Yuanquing, who is the CEO of the Chinese company. The executive folded and unfolded the laptop, perched it on a convenient built-in stand, and then spun it around a few times so the audience could justifiably gawp at it a little. The hinge mechanism can be seen in some of the images (see below) but the fold itself doesn’t seem to have too much of an egregious impact on the display.</p>
      <p>Apparently there is a 2K-capable OLED screen for media consumption on the foldable Lenovo ThinkPad X1, so clearly the company wants to convince potential purchasers that at least the screen is almost top-notch. Little has been divulged in regard to the innards, and there’s no word on price yet either. However, it is believed the foldable PC will start being <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-s-foldable-Thinkpad-X1-notebook-expected-to-launch-by-Q2-2020.439806.0.html">shipped</a> in the second quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>Obviously, the device on show is somewhat in a raw state. It does have an unfinished look to it, and the black tape over the central hinge looks incongruous and messy. This is not a production model of the Lenovo ThinkPad X1, though, and the final product will likely be much more impressive. Some have questioned the point of a ThinkPad without the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-s-struggle-with-keyboards-on-its-AMD-powered-ThinkPads.442790.0.html">renowned keyboard</a> or famous TrackPoint, and others have bemoaned its somewhat coarse appearance. But if Lenovo manages to produce a clean-looking workable business laptop with the foldable ThinkPad X1 it could end up revolutionizing the target sector.</p>
