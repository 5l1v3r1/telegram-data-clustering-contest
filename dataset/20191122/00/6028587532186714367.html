      <h1>One Of The Biggest Leaks Ever Exposes Data On 1.2 Billion People</h1>

      <p>Data sleuth extraordinaire Bob Diachenko is at it again. His latest discovery: a collection of profiles that contained detailed information on a staggering 1.2 billion individuals.</p>

      <p>As is often the case with the leaks Diachenko tracks down, <a href="https://www.dataviper.io/blog/2019/pdl-data-exposure-billion-people/">this latest example</a> was traced back to an unsecured Elasticsearch server. Information stored in the database appeared to belong to two different companies, both of which operate completely legitimate data aggregation businesses.</p>
      <p>One source was People Data Labs (PDL), which bills itself as “the source of truth for person data.” PDL boasts that its profiles offer “unparalleled coverage across over 150 data points.”</p>
      <p>The other was OxyData.io, a company that provides “in-depth data on people and companies.” Oxydata has aggregated data on more than 380 million people and some 14 million companies.</p>
      <p>Diachenko and his colleague Vinny Troia compared samples from the exposed data to profiles provided by both PDL and Oxydata. Both were nearly perfect matches.</p>
      <p>According to Troia’s report, his own Oxydata record seemed to contain a fairly complete copy of information from his LinkedIn profile.</p>
      <p>His PDL profile was even more detailed. It even contained a 10-year-old phone number he’d been assigned as part of an AT&amp;T bundle but never actually used.</p>
      <p>The researchers contacted both companies and both claimed that the server leaking the database did not belong to them. Assuming that’s true, that makes this leak even more alarming.</p>
      <p>This is the reality we’re faced with heading in to 2020. Scores of legitimate companies are harvesting data about us from sources all over the Internet. They’re combining that data to form incredibly detailed profiles of us and then selling or sharing those profiles with other companies.</p>
      <p>The data flows like water... and it keeps getting spilled.</p>
      <p>At 1.2 billion records, Troia notes that this is one of the largest leaks we’ve ever witnessed. We may never learn who it was that compiled both companies’ data into a single database and then left it exposed.</p>
      <p>Even if we did, Troia notes that there may be very little that could be done. Data enrichment companies are still largely unregulated and legal protections for our personal data are sadly lacking.</p>
      <p>Until that changes, about the best we can do is change email addresses and phone numbers... and perhaps create new Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn accounts from scratch.</p>
      <p>When it feels like your data will just get leaked again, though... many victims might wonder why they should even go through the trouble.</p>
