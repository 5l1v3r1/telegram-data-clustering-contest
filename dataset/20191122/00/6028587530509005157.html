      <p>The 2019 campaign has been a long and frustrating one for Giants running back Saquon Barkley. In addition to having to fight through a high ankle sprain suffered back in Week 3, Barkley’s production hasn’t come close to meeting the standards that he established in his rookie campaign.</p>
      <p>But after getting away for the bye week, Barkley has had some time to reflect as to how he wants to end his second NFL season. </p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters Thursday, Barkley said he used the time away to “work on myself,” admitting that external factors may have played a more significant part in his struggles than he initially was willing to accept.</p>
      <p>“I allowed, I don’t know what it was, for me not to be me. I don’t care—that’s who I am, and that’s what I’m getting back to these last six weeks. I’m going to go out there and ball and have fun. Whatever happens, happens,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I’m not going to be worried about if he’s hitting it too much or if he’s not, he’s not doing this or doing that. There’s a reason why I got drafted here. There’s a reason why I’m one of the best running backs in the league, and I’m just going to go out there and play and do what I do.”</p>
      <p>Barkley is coming off a Week 10 performance against the Jets in which he gained one rushing yard in 13 carries.</p>
      <p>To be fair, Barkley often didn’t have a chance on his rushing attempts, most of which were not only sent up the middle where the Giants have struggled to run the ball all year long, but also because on 11 of his 13 carries, a defender was in the backfield as soon as Barkley got the ball.</p>
      <p>While that performance initially ate away at Barkley, he did some research over the bye and found that one of his boyhood idols, Hall of Fame running back Barry Sanders, once had a 13-carry, -1 yard game in his career in a 1994 playoff game against the Packers. </p>
      <p>“I don’t think that stopped him from having a great career,” Barkley said.</p>
      <p>“There’s going to be times where you’re in a funk. There’s going to be times where things aren’t going your way. Obviously, I would love to make it go my way. I would love to have 13 carries for 300 yards. I’m not going to get down on myself.”</p>
      <p>Barkley stopped to reflect on a question asking if he thought he was trying to do too much in helping to kickstart the Giants from their six-game losing streak. </p>
      <p>“I mean, no, because I think there are times where I did too less, where, say if a guy got beat quick, I would just take what they give me. I would just not go down with ease, but just be more focused on securing the ball and live for another down, where there are times I can make that play and make someone miss and do what I do best,” he said. </p>
      <p>“I’m not worried about pressing it. I’m not worried about not doing too much or doing too much. I’m worried about going back and playing how I know how to play, how I’ve been playing my whole life since I was a little kid.  </p>
      <p>“People tried to change my running style in high school and middle school,” he added. “There’s always someone. So, I’m just going to go out there and have fun, and that’s the biggest thing. Have fun, be a little kid, and just try to ball out for my brothers.” </p>
