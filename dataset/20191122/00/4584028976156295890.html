      <h1>Klopp happy with England&amp;#039;s handling of Gomez-Sterling bust up</h1>

      <p>Jurgen Klopp has no problem with how England manager Gareth Southgate chose to handle the incident between Joe Gomez and Raheem Sterling.</p>
      <p>Gomez and ex-Liverpool star Sterling were involved in a scuffle at St George's Park on November 11, the day after the pair clashed in the Reds' 3-1 win over Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Southgate dropped Sterling for England's 7-0 win over Montenegro, a match in which Joe Gomez came on and was booed by certain sections of the crowd.</p>
      <p>Sterling returned in the 4-0 victory over Kosovo as England wrapped up their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign, though Gomez - who has insisted the matter has been fully put to bed - missed out with a knee injury.</p>
      <p>Klopp expects Gomez to be able to play against Crystal Palace on Saturday if required, and the Liverpool boss is satisfied with how Southgate dealt with the situation.</p>
      <p>"Gomez is better than good, everything is fine," Klopp told a news conference on Friday.</p>
      <p>"If people are not sensible with it, it gets made bigger than it is and we speak about it for five weeks. The people involved are fine.</p>
      <p>"Things like this happen in a football environment. It's a big challenge to ask the boys to give everything against each other and then the next day ask them to play together.</p>
      <p>"There is nothing more to say about it. Gareth and the English FA dealt with it like I think it was right, I cannot judge because I was not in the situation. Joe is absolutely okay, nothing else to say about it really."</p>
      <p>Liverpool's triumph over City at Anfield sent the Reds nine points clear of the defending champions with 12 games played.</p>
