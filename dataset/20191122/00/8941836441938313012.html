      <p>AUBURN, Ala. (AP) - Auburn University is retiring its 20-year-old golden eagle mascot two years after it was grounded from flying at football games because of heart disease.</p>
      <p>A university statement issued Friday says the bird named Nova is being replaced by another golden eagle named <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aurea/">Aurea</a> that will become War Eagle VIII.</p>
      <p>A ceremony marking the transition is planned for Auburn’s home football game against Samford University on Saturday. Nova has been sidelined since 2017 after being diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, which is a chronic heart disease.</p>
      <p>A statement by veterinarian Seth Oster says Nova will mostly be restricted to presentations at the university’s raptor center.</p>
