      <p>The cinematic <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/01/221104/horror-noire-jordan-peele-documentary">genre of horror noire</a> is growing larger and even scarier, and surprisingly, the latest terrifying title has nothing to do with <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/03/227596/what-is-us-about-jordan-peele-movie-review-lupita-nyongo">black horror aficionado Jordan Peele</a>. This new addition will star someone not known for having an affection for the eerie — Janelle Monáe. The <i><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2018/05/199428/uncover-janelle-monae">Dirty Computer</a></i><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2018/05/199428/uncover-janelle-monae"> </a>singer will use her pipes to scream in terror (or make <i>us</i> scream) as the lead character of the upcoming horror flick <i>Antebellum</i>, and from the looks of the film’s trailer, it's going to be an actual nightmare. Buckle in, folks: We're headed back to the days of slavery in the antebellum era.</p>
      <p>Marketing efforts for the film are keeping its storyline purposely vague, sharing a shadowy summary with <i><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/janelle-monae-antebellum-trailer">Vanity Fair</a></i>. "Celebrated author Veronica Henley (Monáe) finds herself trapped in a horrifying reality and must uncover the mind-bending mystery before it’s too late."</p>
      <p>From the teaser, we can see that the story will be told in the past and in the present. <i>Antebellum</i> will likely bring every black person's deepest fear — being transported back to the days of American slavery — to life. Monáe is shown working on a farm in what looks to be the antebellum South, but she's also seen in the present sporting a fabulous outfit while out drinking with a group of friends (which includes <i>Empire</i> actress Gabourey Sidibe!).</p>
      <p>Produced by the brilliant but twisted minds behind <i>Get Out</i> and <i>Us</i>, <i>Antebellum</i> will probably run along similar lines in its creative exploration of social themes. Peele used American racism and appropriation as the foundation for the <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2017/02/142491/get-out-movie-review-white-women-racism">bone-chilling narrative</a> in the <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2018/03/192524/get-out-oscar-best-original-screenplay-jordan-peele-speech">Oscar-winning </a><i><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2018/03/192524/get-out-oscar-best-original-screenplay-jordan-peele-speech">Get Out</a></i>. In <i>Us</i>, he not-so-subtly provides an ingenious critique of classism and xenophobia through his <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/03/227858/what-are-the-tethered-in-us-movie">protagonist Red/Adelaide</a>.</p>
      <p>In the same vein, it looks like <i>Antebellum</i> will depict the truly nightmarish nature of racism by transporting its characters, and its audience, to one of the most sinister time periods in American history.</p>
