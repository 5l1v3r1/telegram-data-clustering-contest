      <h1>The Huawei Mate 30 Pro has officially arrived in Europe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Editors.212978.0.html?tx_nbc2journalist_pi1%5Bmode%5D=show&amp;tx_nbc2journalist_pi1%5Buid%5D=278" target="_blank">Alex Alderson</a></address>

        <b>The time has come for Huawei fans to act, as the Chinese company has officially brought the Mate 30 Pro to EU shores. The handset comes without Google Mobile Services, while its release is limited to Spain for the time being. However, this could well prove to be a trial run to see whether Europeans are prepared to pay flagship prices for a smartphone without Google Mobile Services.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A trial run has started in Madrid, Spain's capital city. In the seemingly never-ending release of the Mate 30 series, Huawei is now offering the Mate 30 Pro at its Madrid store. There are some caveats, though. Firstly, the Chinese company is only selling one version of the device. Secondly, the model on sale only supports 4G connectivity; by contrast, Chinese consumers can choose between 4G and 5G models. Thirdly, Huawei is only selling limited quantities of the Mate 30 Pro in its Madrid store, although it has not specified how many it has brought to Spain.</p>
      <p>So for a limited time, you can buy a Space Silver version of the Mate 30 Pro with 8 GB of RAM, 256 GB of storage in Spain for the princely sum of €1,099. Huawei is including a €299 Huawei Store voucher with all Mate 30 Pro purchases though, which customers must spend before December 9, 2019.</p>
      <p>As we may have already twigged, Huawei pre-installs Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) and its App Gallery, its in-house versions of Google Mobile Services (GMS) and the Google Play Store, respectively. Websites like <a href="https://www.huaweiadvisor.com/how-to-install-core-gms-packages-google-play-store-on-huawei-honor-phones/">Huawei Advisor</a> offer guides on installing GMS and the Play Store though, which do not look like an overly daunting task for those who are acquainted with tinkering with their smartphones.</p>
      <p>We should point out that there could be security risks with sideloading software from unverified sources. While it remains to be seen whether Huawei will bring the Mate 30 series to other European countries, handsets will ship without GMS and the Play Store if it does. There have been <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Huawei-Mate-30-and-Mate-30-Pro-pre-orders-begin-amid-a-probable-wider-rollout.440601.0.html">rumours</a> that Huawei will introduce the Mate 30 series in Germany next month, but the Chinese company is yet to confirm this. Ultimately, the success of this limited release in Spain could determine whether we see a broader Mate 30 series release across Europe and beyond.</p>
