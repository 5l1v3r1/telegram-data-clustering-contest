      <h1>Twitter to let all users hide replies</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/bloomberg" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a></address>
      <p>Twitter Inc. said it will start letting all users hide replies to the tweets they send, an effort to improve the health of discussions and interactions on the service.</p>
      <p>The company has been testing the feature since summer in different markets, including the U.S. and Japan, but is now rolling it out globally.</p>
      <p>The tool lets users hide specific comments made on their posts, meaning those comments won’t be visible to other users unless they click a button to reveal them.</p>
      <p>The change provides a degree of control that could be used to keep spammers away, or to hide hateful or inappropriate replies.</p>
      <p>“Everyone should feel safe and comfortable while talking on Twitter,” the San Francisco-based company wrote in a blog post Thursday. “To make this happen, we need to change how conversations work on our service.”</p>
