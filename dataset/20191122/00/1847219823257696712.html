        <b>On 21 November, the University of Latvia (LU) sent Latvia’s Prime Minister Krišjānis Kariņš a peace treaty offer in the approval case for acting rector Indriķis Muižnieks, requesting recognition of results of elections and have him approved as the university’s rector, said LU vice-rector Ina Druviete at a press-conference on Friday, 22 November.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In reality, the only topical aspect is Muižnieks’ request to change the decision made against him. According to information from the Administrative Regional Court, LU is the defendant in this case.</p>
      <p><i>PriceWaterhouseCooper Legal</i> leading senior lawyer and LU representative in court Benno Butulis says LU is no plaintiff in Muižnieks case, it is the defendant, which is not an obstacle for offering a peace treaty for the government.</p>
      <p>According to the lawyer, in theory and in practice the courts’ decisions in temporary protection cases coincides with the final ruling, and LU belies the ruling in this case could be the same with 90% probability.</p>
      <p>«Respectively, we can safely say the decision made by the Cabinet of Ministers was unjustified and apparently illegal,» said Butulis. He also stresses that the government has been informed of this. According to him, the government’s and Education Ministry’s position is legally unjustified.</p>
      <p>LU representative also turned attention to the fact that acting rector Gvido Straube’s approval went with an important objective in mind – organization of new rector elections. However, the 20 November ruling of the regional court made it impossible to do.</p>

          <b>Kariņš refuses to continue litigation over Muižnieks’ approval as rector</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Druviete says the university’s developed peace treaty mentions – if the government declares the order for Muižnieks’ approval as null and void and does not approve him as rector, the university, as well as Muižnieks, will withdraw their pleas from the court.</p>
      <h3>The peace treaty provides for the university and Muižnieks withdraw their claims for compensation, said Druviete.</h3>
      <p>The vice-rector stresses that this would resolve the situation and help bring stability, which would help improve the quality of higher education. Druviete hopes the government responds and both sides come to an understanding that litigation is not in their best interest. LU lawyer believes a peaceful resolution is the best possible solution for the situation.</p>
      <p>LU Administration’s lawyer Anda Ozola said at the press-conference that Education Ministry is not interested in legality or higher education reform, which, according to her, is an excuse why the institution turns against Muižnieks as a private person.</p>
      <p>As previously reported, on 26 August LU turned to the Administrative District Court with a plea against the state, requesting making the Cabinet of Ministers to decide in favour of approving Muižnieks as LU rector. On 30 August Gvido Straube was picked as acting rector. Later he said he has no plans to maintain LU’s plea against the government in the case regarding Muižnieks.</p>
