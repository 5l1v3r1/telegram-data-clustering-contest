      <h1>Elon Musk Wants to Add “Fold Out Solar Wings” to Cybertruck</h1>

      <h3>Cyber Goes Solar</h3>
      <p>During a Thursday evening event near SpaceX’s headquarters in Hawthorne, Calf., Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/tesla-elon-musk-unveils-blade-runner-cybertruck">finally showed off</a> the company’s long-awaited “Cybertruck.”</p>
      <p>And while we’re all still trying to digest its <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/reactions-tesla-cybertruck">extremely polarizing design</a>, Musk’s mind is already racing far ahead — imagining a bright, renewable energy-fueled future with his much-beloved truck in the middle of it.</p>
      <h3>Extra Miles</h3>
      <p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1197889310550216704">Friday tweet</a>, Musk revealed that the Cybertruck is getting “an option to add solar power that generates 15 miles per day, possibly more.” And he didn’t stop there.</p>
      <p>“Adding fold out solar wings would generate 30 to 40 miles per day,” he wrote.</p>
      <h3>Radical Design</h3>
      <p>The brand new truck’s design is arguably already radical enough, with or without solar panels. But the truck could probably incorporate solar panels without much of a design departure.</p>
      <p>And any future Tesla truck owner will likely need it. Tesla is aiming the truck squarely at an outdoors crowd, even including its very own all terrain vehicle as a future option. While Tesla’s Supercharger network is second to none, electric car chargers still aren’t nearly as ubiquitous as gas stations.</p>
