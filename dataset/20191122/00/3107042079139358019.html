      <h1>Brown at Highlanders for three seasons</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.odt.co.nz/author/Steve%20Hepburn" target="_blank">Steve Hepburn</a></address>
      <p>Tony Brown may not be coaching the All Blacks but he will be involved with the Highlanders for the next three seasons.</p>
      <p>The franchise had signed Brown through until 2022 but that was dependent on his international commitments.</p>
      <p>With Brown linked to the main coaching candidates for the vacant All Black position, there was a fear he would coach for the 2020 season only and then move on.</p>
      <p>However, with Brown joining Brave Blossoms head coach Jamie Joseph in Japan through until the next World Cup, he is now able to coach the Highlanders for the next three seasons.</p>
      <p>Highlanders chief executive Roger Clark is thrilled Brown has confirmed he will stay until 2022 with the Highlanders.</p>
      <p>"It is a massive coup for us. Everybody wants him - the All Blacks wanted him and now we have got him for the next three years," Clark said.</p>
      <p>"It's incredibly exciting for our fans."</p>
      <p>Clark said it was a real boost for the young players in the team to have Brown involved on the attack side.</p>
      <p>Brown, who will be the attack coach and also be in charge of the game plan, would have a significant workload through the year but, with the way Super Rugby was structured, it should be manageable, Clark said.</p>
      <p>The Super Rugby season will start early next year - the first round is in late January and it will be over by June.</p>
      <p>The test windows are in July and November, when the Highlanders are not playing.</p>
      <p>From 2021, the Super Rugby competition will go from mid to late February to the end of June when it reverts to a true round-robin format.</p>
      <p>Clark said Brown had been doing two jobs for a good while so he was used to it and was a good manager of time.</p>
      <p>Brown was also an assistant coach and not the head coach, so that would make his job easier.</p>
