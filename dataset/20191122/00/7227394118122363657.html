      <h1>Huawei reveals the nova 6 5G in a new video teaser</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=32" target="_blank">Yordan</a></address>
      <p>Huawei is launching the nova 6 lineup on December 5, less than six months after the arrival of the nova 5 family. We’ve seen the phone leak with a punch hole in its display hosting dual shooters and a camera setup that hasn’t had a major overhaul, but now the company released an official teaser, giving us a far clearer look at the actual front and back panels.</p>
      <p>We can clearly see a triple camera setup, complemented by an LED flash, all lined up vertically. On the side, there is a tiny sensor, likely for a macro camera and what might be laser AF. Although Huawei is pushing a new, nova-inspired, design on the back panel, we can see that this device will also have a white glossy option with no letters on the panel.</p>

      <p>Sadly, the Huawei nova 6 (or at least one of the phones from the nova 6 family) will miss on the 3.5 audio jack. The fingerprint scanner will be mounted on the power button on the side, while pn the bottom, the USB-C will have a speaker grille on one side, with the SIM tray on the other.</p>

      <p>We are expecting a wide-angle selfie camera with 105-degree FoV, which should be enough to get everyone in the shot.</p>
      <p>The official launch is in two weeks and that’s when we’ll see how many nova 6 phones will arrive and what will be the full name of the device, seen in the video.</p>
