      <p>LONDON: Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) President Shehbaz Sharif and Dr Adnan Khan on Friday gave important health updates about former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.</p>
      <p>Speaking to media, Shehbaz said that Nawaz had gone through the process of cardiac intervention seven times.</p>
      <p>"He was monitored by a doctor from Switzerland," said Shehbaz. "Some tests will be conducted today and some tomorrow."</p>
      <p>Nawaz's personal physician Dr Adnan said that arteries carrying blood to Nawaz's brain were 80 percent blocked.</p>
      <p>"Nawaz's medical appointments are booked," he said. "If the need arises, he will be taken to the hospital."</p>
      <p>The government removed Nawaz's name from the ECL after a verdict from the Lahore High Court allowed the former prime minister to go abroad without the government's conditions.</p>
      <p>However, the court included an undertaking from both Nawaz and Shehbaz which said that he would return to Pakistan after he recovered.Â </p>
