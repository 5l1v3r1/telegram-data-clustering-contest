      <h1>Isro postpones PSLV-C47 mission launch to Nov 27</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:15:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/rasheed-kappan" target="_blank">Rasheed Kappan</a></address>
      <p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has postponed the launch of its mission PSLV-C47 carrying Cartosat-3 to 9.28 am on November 27.</p>
      <p>The rocket will blast off from the second launch pad of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota.</p>
      <p>The launch was initially scheduled for November 25. The PSLV-C47 mission will be the 21st flight of India’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle in the ‘XL’ configuration (with six solid strap-on motors).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nanosatellites</b>
      </p>
      <p>Onboard PSLV-C47 will be 13 commercial nano-satellites from the United States. This is part of a commercial arrangement with the New Space India Limited (NSIL), Department of Space. The mission’s benefits include weather mapping, cartography or army defence, and strategic applications.</p>
      <p>A third-generation agile advanced satellite, Cartosat-3 is equipped with a high-resolution imaging capability. It will be placed in an orbit of 509 km at an inclination of 97.5 degrees, according to the space agency.</p>
      <p>The imaging capability will be panchromatic, where all visible colours of light are captured; multispectral, where light within specific ranges in the electromagnetic spectrum is captured; and hyperspectral, capturing light from across the EM spectrum, the space agency added.</p>
