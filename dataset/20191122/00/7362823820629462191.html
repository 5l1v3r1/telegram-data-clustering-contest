      <p>Football and baseball star <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-tebow">Tim Tebow</a> gave a teary-eyed goodbye to his beloved dog this week.</p>
      <p>“One of the toughest goodbyes. Wanted to make a special tribute to the sweetest boy ever - thank you for all the joy you brought and all the memories,” the 2007 Heisman Trophy winner <a href="https://twitter.com/TimTebow/status/1197316688032735232">posted</a> on his social media Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>He shared touching pictures and melancholy videos.</p>

      <p>He said he had to put down Bronco, his Rhodesian Ridgeback, on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Tebow got the dog from his brother Robby, and he said the dog was his favorite birthday gift ever, as <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/tim-tebow-dog-bronco-tribute/1tbuinr7kawz81knsx40tlo4de?fbclid=IwAR07VvIvUhQwLjQkcqEUDXJd_OG_eyzY63RORn-IJXw9s66H8ohWGvyZCkk">Sporting News</a> reported.</p>

      <p>The dog was named after the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/denver-broncos">Denver Broncos</a>, the team that selected Tebow in the first round of the 2010 NFL Draft.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Tebow posted online a photo of him kneeling in front of Bronco’s grave: “Im so thankful and humbled by everyone’s support, prayers and love. I was able to lay Bronco to rest in a really special place. Thank you all for so much encouragement. I love you Bronco, thanks for being the sweetest boy.”</p>

      <p>Tebow has spent three full seasons in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/new-york-mets">New York Mets</a> organization. The last two seasons had been derailed by injuries, but his inability to make the team’s major league roster appeared to have put the organization’s experiment with the two-sport athlete in question.</p>
      <p>Mets general manager Brodie Van Wagenen said he expects <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tim-tebow-mets-2020-general-manager">Tebow to start spring training on time in 2020</a>.</p>
