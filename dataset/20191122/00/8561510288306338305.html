      <h1>Boeing Unveils Spacecraft Built to Carry Astronauts to ISS</h1>

      <h3>Perfect Fit</h3>
      <p>On Thursday, Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft <a href="https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2019-11-21-Boeing-Starliner-placed-atop-United-Launch-Alliance-rocket-for-first-flight">left the hangar</a> for the first time en route to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.</p>
      <p>There, Boeing attached Starliner to the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket that will launch the passenger capsule into space on December 17 — putting the craft one step closer to ferrying astronauts to the <a href="https://futurism.com/boeing-starliner-test-flight">International Space Station for NASA</a>.</p>
      <h3>Rosie the Rocketeer</h3>
      <p>Starliner’s first trip into space won’t include any human crew members, but it will have a <a href="https://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2019/11/21/boeing-names-test-dummy-fly-aboard-first-starliner-flight-after-iconic-rosie-riveter/4230233002/">test dummy</a> modeled after WWII icon Rosie the Riveter on board.</p>
      <p>If all goes as planned, the spacecraft will automatically dock with the ISS following the December 17 launch. It’ll return to Earth shortly after, using a system of <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/boeing-starliner-parachute-fails-deploy">parachutes</a> and airbags to ensure a soft landing at one of five possible locations in the United States, <i>The Verge</i> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975710/boeing-cst-100-starliner-roll-out-atlas-v-uncrewed-test-flight">reports</a>.</p>
      <h3>A Tale of Two Capsules</h3>
      <p>The other spacecraft being developed for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, completed its first <a href="https://futurism.com/spacex-crew-dragon-launch-demo-1">test launch</a> in March, successfully docking with the ISS before eventually <a href="https://futurism.com/spacex-crew-dragon-spacecraft-land-atlantic">splashing down</a> in the Atlantic Ocean as planned.</p>
      <p>And now, Boeing’s Starliner is one step closer to its own judgement day.</p>
