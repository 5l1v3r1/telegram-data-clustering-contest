      <p>The fate of embattled National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, appears to be hanging in the balance as the National Executive Committee of the party meets in Abuja on Friday (today).</p>
      <p>There is a strong debate among party faithful over whether Oshiomhole should continue his job as chairman of the APC.</p>
      <p>The Progressives Governors Forum had last week asked him to convene a NEC meeting to address the party’s challenges or resign his position.</p>
      <p>A statement by its Director-General, Salihu Lukman, reads, "It is either Oshiomhole respects the provision of the party’s constitution and convene superior organ meeting to deliberate on all our challenges or he should just accept his inability to manage the party and simply resign."</p>
      <p>There had been a growing internal crisis within the APC before and after the 2019 general elections.</p>
      <p>In Oshiomhole’s suspension letter, Edo State APC Chairman, Anselm Ojezua, accused him of being behind the party’s internal crisis.</p>
      <p>Some of the party’s aspirants that failed to secure tickets for different political offices also passed a vote of no confidence on him and accused him of corruption.</p>
      <p>Also, protesters carrying placards on Friday stormed the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja calling for the immediate resignation of Oshiomhole.</p>
      <p>Sources within the party confirmed that a lot of persons were no longer comfortable with Oshiomhole being chairman of the APC. <br/> </p>
