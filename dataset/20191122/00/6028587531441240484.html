      <p>It’s a big weekend in <i>Borderlands 3</i>: the game just got a major slice of new content with The Maliwan Takedown, a free update with a sort of raid-like activity that’s meant to challenge hardcore players that have already built out unbeatable builds. And there might even be more of those, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/21/massive-borderlands-3-patch-buffs-mozes-mech-fl4ks-pets-and-zanes-everything/#35100d0f1571">considering a spate of buffs that went out with a recent patch.</a> But whether you’re trying to build out your gear collection or still on your way up in the main game, Randy Pitchford just dropped a SHiFT Code for 3 Golden Keys usable for the chest on Sanctuary:</p>
      <p>So once again, that SHiFT code is 5BC3B-9FFHZ-6TKHK-ZTKJT-ZWR9B, usable either in-game or on <a href="https://borderlands.com/en-US/vip/">the Borderlands VIP website.</a> Once you input the code you can collect your keys from the in-game “social” menu, and then use them on the chest on Sanctuary. The chest itself offers up a somewhat intoxicating Borderlands chest animation, all mechanical and whirring as it presents the sweet loot inside. <i>Borderlands 3 </i>is a game built around the steady dopamine drip that you get with the shining appearance of a new gun, and the chest on Sanctuary is designed to deliver a big hit.</p>
      <p>It’s only too bad that they’re not a great source of loot. I feel like at the end of the day they’re better deployed keeping yourself kitted out as the game progresses rather than building someone unstoppable in the end game. They can be super helpful in the mid-game, however, to give you a little edge with some new weapons.</p>
      <p>So don’t hoard your Golden Keys, spend them freely and reap the rewards. <i>Borderlands 3</i> is sort of entering its second phase now, with launch firmly in the rear view and the era of continuing content beginning. <i>Borderlands 3 </i>isn’t quite on the level of a full-on games-as-service, but it’s still moving pretty quickly, with two large-ish drops since launch. I’ll be curious to see how this thing pans out as we move into the next year. I know <i>Borderlands 2</i> has maintained its fan base for years, and so we’ll see if <i>Borderlands 3</i> maintains the same thing.</p>
