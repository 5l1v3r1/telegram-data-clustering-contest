      <p>You can browse our full <b><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events">NYC show calendar</a></b> for all of tonight’s shows, but here are some highlights…</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/brockhampton-expand-heaven-belongs-to-you-tour-100-gecs-opening/"><b>Brockhampton, slowthai, 100 gecs @ The Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden</b></a><br/>Since becoming the biggest breakout rap group of 2017 (a year in which they released three albums), Brockhampton have stayed super busy and super prolific since then, and their super fun live shows are just as worth it as their albums. They’re now touring in support of this year’s <i>Ginger</i> with rising UK rapper slowthai, who appears on <i>Ginger</i> and who released his excellent debut album <i>There’s Nothing Great About Britain</i> this year. Opening is the undefinable experimental duo 100 gecs. They’re playing NYC tonight and tomorrow.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/angel-olsen-installation-in-brooklyn-this-weekend-more-tour-dates-added/"><b>Angel Olsen, Vagabon @ Brooklyn Steel</b></a><br/>Angel Olsen went in a more atmospheric direction on this year’s great <i>All Mirrors</i>, and she’ll bring the new songs to life — and play a few old favorites and probably her recent Mark Ronson collaboration — at her three-night Brooklyn Steel run, which continues tonight. Opening is Vagabon, who released her first album for Nonesuch earlier this year and who is worth getting there early for.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/jacolby-satterwhite-teengirl-fantasys-nick-weiss-releasing-lp-as-pat-stream-a-track/"><b>Jacolby Satterwhite &amp; Nick Weiss – “PAT” @ Pioneer Works</b></a><br/>It’s the final weekend of Jacolby Satterwhite’s immersive installation “You’re at Home” and tonight PAT, his musical project with Teengirl Fantasy’s Nick Weiss, will perform their their album Love Will Find a Way Home which owes a lot to trip hop and other club music.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/high-on-fire-power-trip-devil-master-creeping-death-announce-tour/"><b>High on Fire, Power Trip, Devil Master, Creeping Death @ Elsewhere</b></a><br/>This is a ridiculously stacked bill for fans of punk/metal crossover with long-running sludge greats High On Fire, modern-day crossover thrash staples Power Trip, rising thrashy death metallers Creeping Death, and rising blackened punks Devil Master. This is their second of two Brooklyn shows this weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/alex-cameron-announces-new-album-shares-divorce-expands-tour/"><b>Alex Cameron, Holiday Sidewinder, Emily Panic @ Webster Hall</b></a><br/>Alex Cameron’s records are good, heartland rock with more synthesizers, but it’s his live show where the magic happens.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/black-marble-signs-to-sacred-bones-preps-new-lp-listen-to-one-eye-open/"><b>Black Marble, Automatic, Devon Church @ Bowery Ballroom</b></a><br/><i>Bigger Than Life</i> is the first Black Marble album Chris Stewart has made since leaving New York for Los Angeles, and you can hear it in the music. The synthesizers are brighter, the drum machines have more snap and his voice rises from the murk and into the light. If you’re going, get there in time for L.A. trio Automatic whose drummer, Lola Dompe, is the daughter of Bauhaus/Love and Rockets drummer Kevin Haskins and they’ve cleary heard their dad’s band.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/witch-taint-tickets-73859229945"><b>Witch Taint (w/ Dave Hill), Chris Lee @ Mercury Lounge</b></a><br/>Dave Hill’s extremely extreme Norwegian black metal band Witch Taint — now a real band (previously not a real band) — will release their debut album in early 2020 and play this late night show (11:30 door) tonight. “I know it’s late, but when you’re conjuring the devil and stuff you can’t go on any earlier or it’s weird,” Dave tells us. “Anyway, please come before we destroy the universe and it becomes harder to get bookings as a result. The show is like a Broadway play but with cheaper drinks and more guitar solos. We even have an opera singer in the band.”</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/pip-blom-streaming-debut-album-boat-announce-first-u-s-tour/"><b>Pip Blom, The Britanys @ Rough Trade</b></a><br/>Amsterdam quartet Pip Blom ‘s debut album, <i>Boat</i>, is hooky, quirky indie rock with a nice balance of noise and pop melodies.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/counterparts-stray-from-the-path-share-new-songs-touring-together/"><b>Counterparts, Stray From The Path, Varials, Chamber, End @ Gramercy Theatre</b></a><br/>Modern-day melodic metalcore staples Counterparts are on the road supporting their new album <i>Nothing Left To Love</i>, and if you dig this kinda stuff, it’s a pretty solid bill all around.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/youth-of-today-judge-playing-back-to-back-asbury-park-shows/"><b>Youth of Today, The Fight, Chrome Skulls, Crucial Youth, Gel, Redactor @ House of Independents</b></a><br/>Youth of Today haven’t released new music in about 30 years, but they remain one of the best hardcore bands you can see live today. They don’t play very often, so don’t sleep on the opportunity to see ’em.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/gesaffelstein-expands-us-tour-adds-two-kings-theatre-shows/"><b>Gesaffelstein @ Kings Theatre</b></a><br/>French producer Gesaffelstein put out the new album <i>Hyperion</i> (featuring pop-oriented songs with Haim, The Weeknd, and Pharrell) and he more industrial-inspired <i>Novo Sonic System</i> EP this year, and now he brings his tour to Brooklyn’s gorgeous Kings Theatre for shows tonight and tomorrow.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/tours-announced-low-anthem-strand-of-oaksapex-manor-cashmere-cat-more/"><b>The Low Anthem, Futur Primitif @ Le Poisson Rouge</b></a><br/>The Low Anthem are back, and tonight’s a special show, as the band will be performing their fan favorite LP <i>Oh My God, Charlie Darwin</i> for its 10th anniversary.</p>

They play hometown shows tonight and tomorrow at MHOW.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/la-dispute-touche-amore-and-empath-announce-tour/"><b>La Dispute, Touche Amore, Empath @ Starland Ballroom</b></a><br/>La Dispute and Touche Amore came up together in the late 2000s, and they’ve remained staples of modern-day post-hardcore ever since.
