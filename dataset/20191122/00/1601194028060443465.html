      <h4>What's the rumor?</h4>
      <p>Dating back to the summer months, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/kevin-love">Kevin Love</a> has been constantly linked with a move from the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/cleveland-cavaliers">Cleveland Cavaliers</a>, and <a href="https://theathletic.com/1386361/2019/11/17/cavs-trend-lines-head-downward-what-does-it-mean-for-morale-injuries-and-trading-kevin-love-tristan-thompson">reports</a> earlier this week claimed that the 31-year-old would welcome a trade to a contending team.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, <a href="https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/11/21/20975011/giannis-antentokounmpo-carmelo-anthony-kevin-love-trade">Kevin O'Connor of The Ringer</a> is reporting that Love is unlikely to be traded ahead of the trade deadline due to a lack of interest from around the NBA:</p>
      <blockquote>Finding a new home for Love would be tough. Love is in the first year of a four-year contract worth $120.4 million. He's 31 and has undergone more procedures than Cavity Sam from Operation. Even if Love were to go full Jimmy Butler at a Cavaliers practice to demand a trade, few teams want Love and even fewer teams need Love.</blockquote>
      <h4>In case you didn't know...</h4>
      <p>Love has been with the Cavs since 2014, where the forward played a vital role in the team's 2015-16 championship-winning season.</p>
      <p>Following <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/lebron-james">LeBron James</a>' departure last summer, Love committed his future to the organisation by signing a new long-term deal, although despite averaging 18.7 points and 12.2 rebounds through 13 appearances, the Cavs have slumped to a 4-10 record.</p>
      <h4>The heart of the matter</h4>
      <p>While plenty could happen between now and February, it appears that teams are being put off by the four years remaining on Love's existing deal. He missed much of last season through injury and the five-time All-Star is owed $28m in his age-34 season, 2022-23.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the Cavs are also likely to demand plenty in return for their best player - and Love may be forced to see out the last of his prime years in Cleveland.</p>
      <h4>What's next?</h4>
      <p>The Cavs will be hoping to end a sequence of five defeats when they take on the Dallas Mavericks tomorrow night.</p>
