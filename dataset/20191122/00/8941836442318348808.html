      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - The latest on developments in financial markets (all times local):</p>
      <p>11:45 a.m.</p>
      <p>Stocks are mixed in midday trading as a week dominated by ups and downs in U.S.-China trade talks comes to a close.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump said Friday that a deal between the world’s largest economies is “potentially very close” after Chinese President Xi Jinping said Beijing is working to “try not to have a trade war.”</p>
      <p>Banks and retailers were doing well, offsetting declines in technology companies. JPMorgan Chase rose 1%, while Intuit sank 4.8%.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>The S&amp;P; 500 rose 2 points, or 0.1%, to 3,106. The index is on track for its first losing week in the past seven.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 75 points, or 0.3%, to 27,842. The Nasdaq was little changed at 8,502.</p>
      <p>Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 1.76%.</p>

        <p>Technology companies and banks are leading stocks slightly higher on Wall Street in early trading, putting the market on track for its first gain since Monday.</p>
        <p>Oracle rose 1.2% in the first few minutes of trading Friday and Wells Fargo added 0.9%.</p>
        <p>The gains weren’t enough to erase a weekly loss for the S&amp;P; 500 index, which is on track to break a six-week winning streak.</p>
        <p>The gains were broad. In a sign investors were feeling more optimistic, safe-play sectors like utilities were pulling up the rear.</p>
        <p>The S&amp;P; 500 rose 4 points, or 0.1%, to 3,108.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 44 points, or 0.1%, to 27,808. The Nasdaq added 15 points, or 0.2%, to 8,521.</p>
        <p>Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 1.76%.</p>
