        <b>Barcelona are still searching the market for young promises and, in this way, a name has been sounding out from Anderlecht in the last few hours. This is Sambi Lokonga, promising 20-year-old midfielder.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona">Barcelona</a>'s aim is to add to their future squad, with players that, even, are already to make the leap to <b>the first team </b>and play at the highest level.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/a-lokonga-346673">Sambi Lokonga</a> ticks all the boxes: he is young, he has a lot of quality and he is <b>physically powerful</b>. At 20-years-old, he is one of the most important players in the Belgian League.</p>
      <p>He has played nine league games this season and, according to 'Derniere Heure', Barcelona have his name in <b>a very important place</b> on their agenda's.</p>
