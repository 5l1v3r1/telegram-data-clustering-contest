      <h1>Copa Libertadores final: Gabigol ready for another Euro shot</h1>

        <b>Inter striker Gabriel Barbosa has reached new heights on loan at Flamengo and is better placed than ever to succeed in Europe.</b>
      </p>
      <p>When<b> Gabriel Barbosa made his senior debut as a 16-year-old</b> in Neymar's emotional Santos farewell in May 2013, it was anticipated an avalanche of goals and glory would follow<b>. Not many would have foreseen that expectation borne out six years later</b> at Flamengo – Santos' opponents that tearful day – who <b>he will hope to inspire to Copa Libertadores glory</b> against defending champions River Plate in Lima on Saturday.</p>
      <p>There were trophies initially and, predictably for a player <b>nicknamed 'Gabigol' for his prolific finishing </b>in the youth ranks, goals. Two Campeonato Paulista titles arrived before a pair of international campaigns of differing success; after a frustrating Copa America Centenario, he helped Brazil claim an eagerly awaited gold medal at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. That, and a record of 56 goals in 153 appearances for Santos, <b>convinced Inter to part with a reported €25million </b>and give Gabriel a five-year contract on his 20th birthday.</p>
      <p><b>Things did not go to plan at San Siro</b>, though. He was used for just 16 minutes during Frank de Boer's abysmal 85-day tenure and <b>continued to figure largely from the bench </b>under Stefano Pioli for the majority of 2016-17. An angry outburst at not being brought on against Sampdoria was followed by an ill-advised walk-out against Lazio, with the game ongoing, <b>after the third substitute was used</b>.</p>
      <p>It was the final straw for Inter and he was shipped out on loan to Benfica. However, his attitude remained an issue.<b> After finding out he was not in the squad for a Primeira Liga match </b>against Vitoria Setubal in November, Gabriel was photographed at a nightclub where he had reportedly been drinking <b>and remained until 06:00 local time</b> on the day of the game.</p>
      <p>Then-Benfica coach <b>Rui Vitoria has since suggested Gabriel arrived at the wrong time</b> and perhaps needed "another context", which he found by cutting his stay at the Estadio da Luz short. After accumulating 106 minutes across four appearances in five months,<b> the Menino da Vila went home to Santos in January 2018</b>. Unabashed by his shortcomings across the Atlantic, Gabriel thrived in familiar surroundings. He scored his first hat-trick in a Copa do Brasil clash against Luverdense the following May and<b> struck 18 times in the league</b>, earning recognition as the competition's best striker.</p>

      <p><b>"It was an important year for me individually</b>. I increased my goalscoring averages and was the top scorer in the Brasileirao and the Copa do Brasil," said Gabriel.</p>
      <p>The striker's displays led to links with Premier League side West Ham, <b>but he remained in Brazil and joined Flamengo</b> for his next loan stint. He has retained the momentum he was desperate to establish at Inter and reached new levels at the Maracana.</p>

      <p><b>Gabriel has been at his predatory best</b>, scoring a stunning 38 goals in 53 appearances in all competitions as part of Jorge Jesus' formidable, free-flowing attack.<b> The Flamengo fans have become so feverish</b> that a cry of 'Hoje tem gol do Gabigol' – Gabigol is going to score today – was heard when the crowd at the O2 Arena in London hushed as Stefanos Tsitsipas readied a serve in his ATP Finals victory over Dominic Thiem. <b>Leading them to a second Libertadores title this weekend</b> would no doubt secure him a place as an icon in the club's history.</p>
      <p>However, questions still remain for Jesus. Gabriel scored the only goal in a victory over Gremio on Sunday but a hot-headed moment earned him two yellow cards in quick succession – the first for berating the assistant referee and<b> the second for sarcastically applauding the initial booking</b>. As he walked off, he provoked the opposition supporters by counting to five on his right hand, <b>a reference to the 5-0 thrashing Jesus' side handed Gremio</b> to book their place in the Libertadores showpiece in Lima.</p>

      <p>"Gabi is the top goalscorer in the league, <b>he wanted to play for many reasons</b> and mainly because he wanted to score goals, but if I knew this would happen I wouldn't have played him," said Jesus, <b>whose side will be crowned champions of Brazil </b>if Palmeiras fail to beat Gremio on Sunday. The situation worries me a lot. I haven't been able to make him a great player emotionally yet, as he is technically and tactically. <b>I haven't done it yet</b>, but I think it has to go little by little.</p>
      <p><b>"I have time to make him a great player</b>. For example, [Lionel] Messi and [Cristiano] Ronaldo don't have this aspect in their career."</p>
      <p><b>Gabriel is by no means the finished article</b> and while he has developed into a mature forward physically, he remains prone to petulance. However, he has packed a lot into his career and is still just 23 years old. His performances at Flamengo suggest that with the right man management he is far more likely to make a success of an inevitable second stab at Europe. <b>A positive role in a victory against River will underline that</b>.</p>
      <p>"They’re a very strong team, that deserves our respect. They are current champions, they know how to play in this competition."</p>
