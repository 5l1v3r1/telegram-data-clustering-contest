      <h1>Thomas Cook introduces India’s first Easy Payment Plan for Holidays</h1>

      <p>Thanks to Thomas Cook India, travellers can now have better access to their dream holiday. The travel giant has introduced a consumer-friendly initiative where one pays merely 10 per cent to book a holiday, and the remainder of the payment can be done at the time of final handover of travel documents. In addition EMI options have also been put into place for people to pay in installments. The integrated travel and travel related financial services company recently announced its Easy Payment Plan, to facilitate travel experiences. This plan is applicable for all bookings made up to November 30, 2019.</p>
      <p>As per insights on consumer behaviour sourced by Thomas Cook, a large chunk of their Indian clientele plan summer vacations several months of advance and that flexible payment options are a top priority for most Indian customers. By encouraging travellers to pay a minimum of 10 per cent of their booking amount, this encourages them to travel more and plan a vacation. Hence, this is targeted largely at the family segment. In addition to this, Thomas Cook India is also offering its customers a policy where they can enjoy a 100 per cent refund on summer 2020 tour cancellations made before December 31, 2019.</p>
      <p>Rajeev Kale, president and country head, leisure travel, MICE and visas, Thomas Cook India comments on this new offering, “Indian consumers are increasingly looking for easy payment options while booking their holidays, Hence our teams have conceptualised the Easy Payment Plan that empowers customers to pay for their holiday with merely a 10 per cent token amount and enjoy the flexibility of paying the balance 90 per cent only prior to receiving the final handover of travel documents, before departure. This will significantly reduce the burden of paying for holidays in one go, while encouraging consumers to enjoy planning their dream vacation without any hassle.”</p>
