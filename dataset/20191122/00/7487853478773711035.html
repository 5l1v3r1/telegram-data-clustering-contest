      <h1>Chelsea Set to Go After Ben Chilwell in January if Transfer Ban is Lifted</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15276264" target="_blank">James Cormack</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea are believed to be interested in signing ​Leicester's Ben Chilwell in January if their transfer ban is overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>
      <p>FIFA handed the Blues a two-window ban for a breach of regulations relating to the international transfer and registration of players under the age of 18 and the London club have already seen an appeal rejected by the governing body earlier this year. Meanwhile, Chelsea's current appeal to CAS isn't due for a verdict until next month.</p>
      <p>It's a situation that Chelsea boss Frank Lampard might have been stressing a little more about if his side hadn't of made such a brilliant start to the season, however, it's believed that the west Londoners are targeting a long-term replacement for <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/marcos-alonso">Marcos Alonso</a> at left-back - with Chilwell top of their list.</p>

      <p>Both Manchester clubs are also monitoring Chilwell's situation at the King Power, but according to the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-face-fight-to-sign-ben-chilwell-from-leicester-city-if-transfer-ban-is-lifted-a4292761.html">Evening Standard</a>, the Foxes are confident of keeping the England international until at least the summer. The club value the 22-year-old at around £60m and after tying the full-back down to a long-term deal last October, are in a strong position when it comes to negotiating with other clubs over his transfer.</p>
      <p>The Leicester man has been a key component of the Foxes' success under Brendan Rodgers this season. They currently sit second in the <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">Premier League</a> table - level with <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/chelsea">Chelsea</a> - and Chilwell has been part of a back four that holds the best defensive record in the division through 12 games - conceding just eight times thus far.</p>
      <p>With the threat of an established 'top six' club coming in for him, Leicester are believed to be in talks over a fresh deal which would see Chilwell earn more than £100,000 a week. </p>

      <p>At the moment, Chilwell seems content to remain at the King Power as he looks to secure a starting spot for England at Euro 2020, as well as help <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/leicester">Leicester</a> towards <a href="https://www.90min.com/categories/champions-league">Champions League</a> qualification once again.</p>
