      <p>​Arsenal welcome Southampton to the Emirates Stadium on Saturday with both sides looking to to end their long, bleak runs without three points.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have not registered a win in the Premier League since beating Bournemouth 1-0 on 6th October.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have slipped to sixth in recent weeks, and Unai Emery's side now find themselves eight points off the top four.</p>

      <p>You have to go all the way back to September for the last time <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/southampton">​Southampton</a> tasted victory, when they won 1-0 at Sheffield United. </p>
      <p>The Saints are on a wretched run of form, having lost six of their last seven in all competitions, leaving them marooned in the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>With a helping hand from Opta, here are all the stats and facts you need to know ahead of the Premier League clash...</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/arsenal">​Arsenal</a> go into Saturday's fixture with a remarkable run of form at home against the Saints to uphold.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are unbeaten in their last 24 league games against Southampton (W18, D6), with their last defeat coming back in November 1987.</p>
      <p>Southampton have played more Premier League away games against Arsenal without winning than any side has against another in the competition’s history (20 – W0, D5, L15).</p>
      <p>However, there is a silver lining that suggests this rotten run could come to an end this Saturday. Seven of Southampton's eight points earned in the Premier League this season have come in away games (88%). There's no time like the present to take that tally up to a sweet, sweet 10.</p>

      <p>Arsenal have won their last 35 of their last 36 home Premier League games against sides starting the day in the bottom three, including the last 32 in a row. </p>
      <p>Their last such defeat came against West Ham in April 2007, when Bobby Zamora scored the decisive goal before a Rob Green masterclass kept the Gunners at bay.</p>

      <p>The Saints have not had a happy opening 45 minutes this season. Southampton have scored just three goals in the first half this season; no one side has scored fewer, while only Norwich (16) have conceded more in the opening 45 minutes of games than Saints (15).</p>
      <p>To be honest, it's not been a happy start to the season for the Saints. Southampton have lost six of their last seven Premier League games, conceding 23 goals while netting just six in return in this run.​</p>

      <p>Arsenal have a negative goal difference (-1) 12 games into a top-flight season for the first time since the 1982-83 campaign (also -1). They didn’t regain a positive goal difference in that season until their 30th match.​</p>
      <p>This is the joint worst goal difference out of all the top ten teams - Burnley are the only other side in the top half of the table who also have a negative goal difference (also -1).</p>
