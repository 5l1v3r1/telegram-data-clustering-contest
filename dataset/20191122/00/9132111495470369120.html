      <p>A Bole Magistrate court has remanded into police custody a 34-year-old teacher in the Sawla-Tuna-Kalba district of the Savannah region for allegedly raping of a second-year student of Sawla Senior High School (SHS).</p>
      <p>Ernest Ocloo, mathematics tutor at the school is reported to have offered her gifts to lure his victim.</p>
      <p>The student, name withheld, was offered gifts of shito [sause] and yoghurt which she victim declined on several attempts.</p>
      <p>Information available to JoyNews indicates that, between 8 pm and 9 pm on November 12, Mr Ocloo went back to the school after teaching hours and invited the victim to the school's staff common room.</p>
      <p>Upon arrival, he forced her onto the floor and raped her until she became unconscious. Mr Ocloo then carried his victim and sent her to the girls' hostel.</p>
      <p>The Sawla-Tuna-Kalba District Divisional Police Commander ASP Degraft Armah Adjei confirmed the allegation levelled against the teacher.</p>
      <p>“He has been remanded till November 25, to be brought back to the court. However, the suspect stated that he and the girl were lovers,” ASP Adjei revealed.</p>
      <p>He advised teachers to avoid sexual relations with students as it serves as a ground for them to be disrespected.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Joy News investigations revealed that there was a similar allegation against Mr Ocloo with a first-year student.</p>
      <p>In that incident, the mathematics tutor was said to have sneaked into campus after school and invited the student during the school entertainment hours under the pretence that she was accompanying him to town to buy an item.</p>
      <p>The source said Mr Ocloo later ended up with the student in his room and kept her until the following morning before bringing her back to school.</p>
      <p>This first incident is reported to have been handled internally by school authorities without the knowledge of the police until his latest allegation.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the headmaster of the school, Rev. Father Cornelius B. Termaghre has declined to speak on the subject, citing Ghana Education Service (GES) rules and regulations banning him from speaking to the press.</p>
