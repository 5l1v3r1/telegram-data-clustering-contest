      <p>There was a post <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/21/film-trailer-cats-ts-eliot">in <i>The Guardian </i>the other day</a>, timed to the release of the second <i>Cats </i>trailer, which suggested that the film cost £230 million which equates to $297 million U.S. dollars. If accurate, that would be one of the most expensive movies of all time, but it’s (all due respect) not accurate. I’ve spoken to people I know and trust, and, as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/10/03/box-office-universal-and-the-respectable-sustainable-not-bad-pretty-good-year/#1b2f9be66e8e">I noted back in early October</a>, the Tom Hooper-directed adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Weber's stage play cost around $100 million. Look, just watching the trailers: Does <i>Cats </i>look like a movie that cost $300 million? Moreover, does Universal resemble a studio that would spend $300 million not on <i>Jurassic World 3 </i>or <i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i>, but on <i>Cats</i>?There was a jump-covered interview with director B.A. Bayona <a href="http://www.scified.com/news/jurassic-world-2-will-have-a-budget-of-260-million-dollars">three years ago</a> which implied that <i>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom </i>cost $260 million. While it was debunked in an hour or so, it didn’t sound that insane. Sure, that would be a big step up from <i>Jurassic World</i>’s $150 million budget, but the last dino adventure had earned a stunning $652 million domestic and $1.671 billion worldwide. For example, after <i>The Dark Knight </i>earned $1.004 billion worldwide on a $180 million budget, Warner Bros. and friends gave Chris Nolan $250 million for <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i>. I’m not sure any movie at that price would be a bargain, but there was zero chance of Chris Nolan’s trilogy capper not recouping its investment. It earned $448 million domestic and $1.081 billion.</p>
      <p><i>Cats </i>is a live-action musical from Universal, a studio whose three $200 million-plus films have been <i>Furious 7 </i>($250 million, partially due to insurance-covered expenses related to the death of Paul Walker), <i>Fate of the Furious </i>($240 million after <i>Furious 7 </i>earned $1.515 billion) and <i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw </i>($200 million). They have turned Illumination into an animation powerhouse without a single toon costing more than $80 million. They have drowned in profits from cheap (or cheap-ish) movies from the likes of Jason Blum (<i>Get Out</i>) and Will Packer (<i>Ride Along</i>), while even their big swings tend to be closer to <i>Skyscraper </i>($125 million) and <i>The Mummy </i>($125 million) than <i>Warcraft </i>($165 million) and <i>Doctor Dolittle </i>(coming next January at the low, low price of around $175 million).</p>
      <p>Even those <i>Jurassic World </i>movies have been surprisingly “responsible. <i>Jurassic World </i>cost $150 million in 2015 while <i>Fallen Kingdom </i>cost $170 million (including pay bumps for Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard) in 2018. I have no idea what <i>Jurassic World 3 </i>will cost when it opens in June of 2021, but if Universal and friends want to throw $250 million at it, well, that (and <i>Fast &amp; Furious 10</i>) would probably be the one to justify such an expense. Universal’s <i>Les Miserables</i>, also directed by Tom Hooper, earned $441 million worldwide on a $61 million budget in 2012. You really think Universal is going to then give him so much money for a <i>Cats </i>movie<i> </i>that <i>Les Miz </i>numbers would be a disaster?</p>
      <p>At $300 million, grosses equal to <i>Mary Poppins Returns </i>($349 million worldwide on a $130 million budget), <i>The</i> <i>Greatest Showman </i>($435 million/$84 million), <i>La La Land </i>($441 million/$50 million) and <i>Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again! </i>($395 million/$50 million) would qualify as a disaster. The only live-action musicals, sans inflation, to reach even $600 million were Universal’s <i>Mamma Mia! </i>($609 million on a $40 million budget), <i>Aladdin </i>($1.05 billion/$184 million), <i>Beauty and the Beast </i>($1.263 billion/$175 million) and <i>The Lion King </i>($1.65 billion/$165 million). Not only would <i>Cats </i>at that budget be Universal’s most expensive movie by 24%, it would be the most expensive musical ever by a lot and would need to be the biggest non-Disney live-action musical of all time just to break even.</p>
      <p>Nothing about <i>Cats </i>costing almost double what <i>The Lion King </i>did, or more than five times what <i>Les Miserables </i>did, makes any sense. It doesn’t make sense for the studio and their “much expense spared” production history, it doesn’t make sense for the box office history of the live-action musical and it doesn’t make sense that <i>Cats </i>would be the biggest-budgeted non-sequel (sorry <i>Avatar</i>) in Hollywood history. Yet the <i>Cats </i>figure was paraded around mostly so we could point and laugh at how much silly Hollywood spent on their silly cat movie. I don’t know how well <i>Cats </i>is going to perform when it opens next month. But it’ll be aiming for <i>Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again </i>numbers, not <i>Beauty and the Beast </i>grosses.</p>
