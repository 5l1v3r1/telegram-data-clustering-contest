      <p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/black-friday">Black Friday</a> is the time to save money and Amazon has come about it earlier this year with some deals already underway. Now's a good a time as any to pick up some new RAM or SSD for your desktop PC. Leading brands Crucial and Western Digital have a collection of hardware up for sale right now so you don't have to wait until the Black Friday craze.</p>
      <p>Here are the best storage and RAM deals available right now.</p>
      <h3>WD Black SN750 1TB SSD - £40 off at Amazon</h3>
      <p>The Western Digital Black SN750 1TB NVMe SSD is a super-fast and sleek-looking storage solution for your OS and frequently used apps and games. Not only does this thing look the part, its speeds are incredible too. While we're not quite talking PCIe 4.0 speeds, 3,470MB/s is nothing to laugh at.</p>
      <h3>Sleek Storage</h3>

      <h3>WD Blue 2TB SSD - £70 off at Amazon</h3>
      <p>This is a SATA SSD, meaning it has slower read and write speeds than fancier NVMe PCIe drives, but the WD Blue 2TB NAND SSD is still a speedy storage medium. No moving parts and a transfer rate of up to 750MB/s make this drive perfect for storing all your PC games.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>If you don't really have the cash to splash on a PCIe SSD, SATA SSDs are still just as good for storing all your media and games. The WD Blue is a great little drive.</p>
