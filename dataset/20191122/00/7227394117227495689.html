      <h1>iPhone 12 Pro to sport 6GB of RAM, iPhone SE 2 production starts in February</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=25" target="_blank">Vlad</a></address>
      <p>Apple's iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max, due to be launched in September 2020, are both going to sport 6GB of RAM, according to notes shared by Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis and his associates, who have provided reliable information in the past (though not always).</p>
      <p>For comparison's sake, the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_11_pro-9847.php">iPhone 11 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_11_pro_max-9846.php">iPhone 11 Pro Max</a> have just 4GB of RAM. On the other hand, the iPhone 12 will keep the 4GB of RAM that its predecessor, the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_11-9848.php">iPhone 11</a>, also has.</p>

      <p>Both the iPhone 12 Pro and the iPhone 12 Pro Max are also expected to have rear-facing 3D sensing cameras and mmWave 5G support, though it's unclear if they'll also work with sub-6GHz 5G. All three 2020 iPhones will support the latest mobile networking tech.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/kuo_iphone_se_2_will_start_at_399-news-39615.php">iPhone SE 2</a> is still coming, with production reportedly slated to start in February. It will resemble the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_8-8573.php">iPhone 8</a> in looks, and ship with a 4.7-inch display and a Touch ID home button. It will be powered by the A13 chip, aided by 3GB of RAM. This model's official introduction is expected in March.</p>
