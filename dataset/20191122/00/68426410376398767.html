      <p>Moya McPhail and Ralph Walker discovered soon after they met that one of the things they shared in common was a desire to live in an antique English barn.</p>
      <p>That was many years ago and the couple lived in historic Port Hope, Ont. for a time before they decided to move outside the town and find an old barn they could transform into a comfortable home.</p>
      <p>The couple soon discovered, however, that converting a rustic barn into a house brings all sorts of challenges – including the potential for a colony of cluster flies that never want to leave.</p>
      <p>“We said, ‘Okay, we’ll build a new barn,'” Ms. McPhail, principal at Moya McPhail Design, says.</p>
      <p>About eight years ago, the couple purchased 26 acres north of Port Hope, near the tiny hamlet of Campbellcroft, Ont.</p>
      <p>The land was undoubtedly carved from one of the old 100-acre farms in the rolling hills of Northumberland County, Ms. McPhail says.</p>
      <p>One of the existing buildings was an industrial shed that a previous owner used for storing large equipment, then turned into a bungalow. Ms. McPhail eyed the 12-foot high ceilings and decided that the space would be ideal as the starting point for the new house.</p>
      <p>“It was, for us, the perfect opportunity for the barn idea.”</p>
      <p>There was also a garage with an addition on the rear that could provide living space while construction was underway on the main residence.</p>
      <p>Ms. McPhail then set out to design a new house in the style of a barn that wouldn’t look out of place in the countryside of England.</p>
      <h3>The house today</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>While Ms. McPhail designed a new house, Mr. Walker was scouring Ontario for salvaged beams from tumble-down barns. His search took him north to Orillia, south to Dunnville and east to Kingston and Napanee.</p>
      <p>Today the new part of the house has an open living area with a height that reaches 22 feet in the glass lantern atop the building.</p>
      <p>The antique beams weren’t sturdy enough to support the structure so the builder used beams of new material. Mr. Walker found an old-fashioned sawmill in Northumberland and worked with the owner to reclaim the surface of the old wood and use it to clad the modern beams.</p>
      <p>“I was his helper,” Mr. Walker says.</p>
      <p>The couple documented the laborious process of skimming wood from 18-foot beams in photographs that now hang in the mud room.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Ms. McPhail, meanwhile, started by creating a dining room large enough to accommodate the heirloom furniture that was passed down to her from her mother.</p>
      <p>“This was really important to us,” she says of the large dining table and chairs. “My grandmother had it shipped from Scotland.”</p>
      <p>Sliding glass doors in the dining room provide a view of the pond. They also let in the breeze when the weather’s warm.</p>
      <p>Ms. McPhail and Mr. Walker often have dinner gatherings for friends from Port Hope or visiting family.</p>
      <p>The kitchen at the centre of the home has an 11-foot island where guests can gather during dinner preparations.</p>

      <p>“I wanted it to be a community kitchen and I wanted it to be part of the living space,” Ms. McPhail says.</p>
      <p>A large picture window overlooks a stand of evergreens and a feeder where woodpeckers, chickadees and white-breasted nuthatches regularly stop by.</p>
      <p>Built-in appliances and lots of storage space keep the kitchen uncluttered. A wood floor with an antiqued finish is comfortable underfoot, while the rest of the main living space has heated concrete floors that have been stained and polished.</p>

      <p>“We wanted it to be kind of unique, but we didn’t want it to be too pretentious,” Ms. McPhail says of the interior.</p>
      <p>In the living area, a Rumford fireplace has a surround of metal panels with the appearance of oil-rubbed bronze.</p>
      <p>“I think mantles are overrated,” Ms. McPhail says, of her choice to eschew a more traditional fireplace design. She adds that the finish ties in well with the hardware on the doors and windows.</p>

      <p>The original part of the house has been converted to a bedroom wing.</p>
      <p>Rondelle windows in the main living area bring light to the bedroom wing, which was rebuilt with new floors that accommodate the home’s geo-thermal heating and cooling system.</p>
      <p>The former entryway has been turned into a garden room with a sink useful for potting plants.</p>
      <p>There are four bedrooms and a semi-ensuite main bathroom.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In the master bedroom, tall windows provide views of the land and forest outside. Floor-to-ceiling built-in cupboards provide closet space.</p>
      <p>An ensuite master bathroom has a stand-alone bathtub with views to the outdoors. There’s also a walk-in shower and a water closet.</p>

      <p>The area behind the separate garage now provides separate home offices for Ms. McPhail and Mr. Walker. There’s also a bathroom and an outdoor terrace.</p>
      <p>Real estate agent Dee McGee of Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd. says the space could easily provide a guest house with two additional bedrooms.</p>
      <h3>The best feature</h3>

        <figcaption>The backyard almost feels like a 'mini provincial park.' Steve Leach/Steve Leach</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The 26-acre parcel of land includes five acres of perennial gardens, a meadow, hardwood forest and stands of evergreens. The couple dubbed the property “Willowae” for the black willow trees which grow there.</p>
      <p>“It’s like a little mini provincial park,” Mr. Walker says.</p>
      <p>A former wetland has been turned into a pond stocked with fish.</p>
      <p>“I had to learn how to grow things in wet soil,” Ms. McPhail says of the area around the pond.</p>
      <p>Ms. McPhail also created a spiral garden around a well.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Mr. Walker built stone walls and a set of stairs to partially enclose the raised septic bed at the rear. The design is known as a “shepherd’s pass” in Europe because the sheep are funneled into the narrow stairs in single file.</p>
      <p>Ms. McPhail says trails through the forest provide a tranquil place to walk.</p>
      <p>“That’s where the deer sleep in the daytime,” Mr. Walker says.</p>
