      </p>
      <p>The Milgram obedience studies are among the most famous in psychology. They’re featured in most introductory psychology classes and are basically required material for any intro to social psychology course.</p>
      <p>Most psychology undergraduates, at some point, will watch the old black and white recordings of participants in these experiments. They’ll watch as normal people supposedly inflict a number of painful electrical shocks on another person at the direction of an authority figure. Even though all the participants seem to struggle with this experience, most of them carry on shocking a helpless person, demonstrating just how far people will go to satisfy the orders of someone in power. These studies are still seminal in the research areas of obedience to authority, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/conformity">conformity</a>, and social influence more broadly.</p>
      <p>Of course, the shocks in this study weren’t real. The study was set up in a very elaborate way to give participants the impression that they were genuinely shocking another human being. The video recordings that are so often shown to students reinforce this narrative. The participants in these videos appear visibly distressed as they grapple with their own behavior in this situation. Although participants obeyed to different extents (some people did eventually refuse), it appears that everyone believed the ruse.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0190272519861952">a recent paper</a> has cast some doubt on this final piece of the story. Researchers gained access to follow up data collected from Milgram’s participants that assessed the extent to which they believed the shocks they were supposedly delivering were real. Most participants (56 percent) indicated that they fully believed the study. That still left a sizable number who indicated some amount of doubt. Perhaps more importantly, whether or not participants fully believed the study related to the number of shocks they administered. Those who fully believed the study tended to give fewer shocks than those who had doubts.</p>
      <p>This finding caused a bit of an uproar among psychologists online. In a time where the reliability of past studies is frequently called into question, this story initially seemed like another chapter in an evolving crisis of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/confidence">confidence</a> in psychology. However, there are a few important things to note about the new study.</p>
      <p>First, the measures of participant <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/spirituality">belief</a> were collected <i>after</i> participants had completed Milgram’s experiments and therefore knew the shocks were fake. Certainly, it’s possible that the participants accurately remembered whether or not they had doubts about the study and were able to report them. It’s also possible, though, that they were motivated to downplay their belief in the study in light of their behavior.</p>
      <p>From the perspective of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/cognitive-dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a>, those who gave more shocks might be more motivated to justify their behaviors. Convincing themselves that they didn’t really believe that they were hurting someone would be one way to do so (thanks to researchers on Twitter for raising this possibility).</p>
      <p>Second, even if we trust the participants’ reports, the relationship between belief in the study and the number of shocks administered was fairly small. Overall, whether or not participants fully believed the situation explained about 5 percent of the variance in shocking behavior. Put another way, participants who doubted the study’s premise gave, on average, 2.66 more shocks (out of a possible 30) compared to those who fully believed the study. This demonstrates that while people who fully believed that they were hurting someone gave fewer shocks, they still did a fair amount of shocking.</p>

        <b>How Should We Understand the Milgram Studies? A Case for Nuance</b>
      </p>
      <p>Overall, I disagree with the more intense hand-wringing that came from this new study. I think the main conclusions of the Milgram studies hold up.</p>
      <p>However, this paper does make a good contribution to our understanding of these iconic experiments. Participants' belief in the paradigm seems like an important moderator to consider when studying obedience (especially in more extreme paradigms). This is a useful context to consider when thinking about this research.</p>
      <p>More broadly, though, I think this new paper should prompt us to think about how we teach these classic studies. These dramatic demonstrations of psychological phenomena are great for introductory psychology classes. Their methods are engaging and memorable. However, this might lead us into the trap of oversimplifying them.</p>
      <p>For instance, the classic recordings of the Milgram studies might selectively show the “best” participants—ones who seem to fully believe that they are shocking another person. Maybe not every participant believed the situation, and maybe that affected how they responded to authority.</p>
      <p>This alternative picture of the study is more nuanced and that adds complexity to the story. Nuance is hard but necessary for understanding most psychological phenomena. The Milgram studies are perhaps a seminal example of that as well.</p>
