      <h1>South Africa’s first Micro-USB rechargeable AA and AAA batteries</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/partner" target="_blank">Partner</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.chargedpower.co.za/?utm_source=MyBroadband&amp;utm_medium=November_2019"><b>Charged Power</b></a>, the critically acclaimed renewable energy solutions company, has announced the official launch of the first Micro-USB rechargeable AA and AAA batteries in South Africa – the INFINITE POWER.</p>
      <p>Having taken the portable power bank market by storm in the last few years, Charged Power has opted to lend its smart tech to the wider consumer market.</p>
      <p>Rechargeable batteries have always been a pain; they require bulky Ni-MH chargers and access to a wall plug!</p>
      <p>Charged Power offer a more practical solution with their Micro-USB rechargeable batteries: just plug them to any USB device – at home, on the train or even outdoors!</p>
      <p>With a sleek design, the infinite power batteries are both stylish and effective and are bound to replace the numerous redundant batteries you have lying around at home.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Moreover, the Micro-USB cable included allows you to charge 2 batteries from a single port!</p>
      <p>“With Christmas coming up, we wanted to create something sleek for our customers to prevent the excessive battery waste that comes with buying electronics at this time of year, and also to save them money” stated one of CHJGD’s design team.</p>
      <p>The environmentally friendly brand has in the past relished the opportunity to contribute to a reduction in the carbon footprint of mobile phone users with a solar powered offering and increasingly efficient products; the INFINITE POWER battery is no different and serves to reduce environmental pollution.</p>
      <p>Each year in the South Africa hundreds of millions of batteries are thrown away after a single use, contributing to landfills and the subsequent introduction of unwanted chemicals into the environment.</p>
      <p>INFINITE POWER provides an environmentally conscious choice for consumers, helping them avoid contributing to environmental pollution with wasteful single-use batteries.</p>
      <p>Some of the world’s top technology blogs and news outlets have showered CHJGD’s products with praise since the brand’s conception in 2015 with particular emphasis on their range’s performance.</p>
      <p>They are still well known for the world’s smallest 10000 mAh and the retro Kaset power banks. Their power bank range is still ranked top 10 in Europe by top Tech firms.</p>
      <p>As a result, their collection has been a mainstay in the best seller charts across the USA and Europe and now in South Africa.</p>
      <p>With the festive season fast approaching, Infinite Power is bound to join its predecessors with smart power on tap.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.chargedpower.co.za/"><b>Charged Power’s</b></a> new offering is available to shop over at their website now, just in time for Christmas. They will be available from all major retailers in South Africa in a matter of weeks.</p>
