      <p><b>Jose Mourinho returns to the Premier League in time for a London derby</b>, as his Tottenham side face West Ham in the capital.</p>
      <p>Champions <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> <b>will be out to bounce back from the defeat to Liverpool </b>before the international break, but Frank Lampard's buoyant Chelsea stand in the way of a potentially pivotal three points. <b>Arsenal will be desperate for a positive result against Southampton</b>, while Manchester United take on high-flying Sheffield United in a bid to keep a positive recent run going. As for Liverpool, their unbeaten run - and an impressive goalscoring feat -<b> will come up against a Crystal Palace side</b> looking to avoid three consecutive home defeats in the top flight.</p>
