        <b>The Pentagon has revealed previous department estimates of the number of US military facilities polluted by firefighting foam - which has been linked to birth defects and cancer - did not reflect reality.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Robert McMahon, assistant secretary of defense for sustainment, announced Wednesday that, after a recent series of tests, a new, more accurate report on the water quality of <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911191077353337-seoul-washington-cease-talks-on-hosting-us-military-over-trumps-5-billion-demand/">military</a> installations will be delivered to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper in the coming days.</p>
      <p>“I think what you will see out of the report is a revised number above 401,” McMahon said, as reported by <a href="https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/national-security/article237592799.html">McClatchy DC</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>According to a 2018 report from the Department of Defense, a total of 401 military sites tested positive for “higher than allowable” levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are found in a concentrated state within Aqueous Film-Forming Foam (AFFF) that is used by the military to put out aircraft fires.</blockquote>
      <p>The Pentagon official also clarified that in determining which military institutions were contaminated, findings revealed the department “undercounted within some of the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201904301074568970-pentagon-mulld-space-national-guard/">[National] Guard</a> sites.”</p>
      <p>Though the previous report found that decontamination efforts will cost the Pentagon more than $2 billion, the additional findings are expected to raise the associated cleanup costs - on top of the $22 million already spent in researching new firefighting foams.</p>
      <p>McMahon did note that a newly developed, viscous AFFF with lower concentrations of PFAS has been adopted for training missions. However, the original AFFF formula - which spreads across an area faster than the newer version - remains the go-to chemical to neutralize aircraft fires.</p>
      <blockquote>This announcement comes shortly after <a href="https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/national-security/article236413328.html">McClatchy DC</a> reported that there was a 61% rise in bladder, kidney and ureter cancer treatments among veterans at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals between fiscal years 2000 and 2018. Blood cancer; liver and pancreatic cancer; and prostate cancer treatments also climbed 18%, 96% and 23%, respectively, in the same period. With rising levels of cancer diagnoses and treatments, many veterans are concerned that cases among them and their family members are linked to the firefighting foam.</blockquote>
      <p>In addition to informing current <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201911211077363614-leadership-missteps-may-harm-human-smuggling-drug-probes-against-us-marines/">service members</a> of which facilities are contaminated, the upcoming report is also expected to present a framework for future department-funded health care options for those affected.</p>
