      <h1>Injury Update For Cowboys LB Leighton Vander Esch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:02+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>The Dallas Cowboys may head into this weekend’s showdown with the New England Patriots without the services of key linebacker Leighton Vander Esch.</p>
      <p>Vander Esch missed the Week 9 game against the New York Giants with a neck injury but returned to play in Dallas’ next two games. However, it looks like the issue has reared its ugly head again.</p>
      <p>According to the Dallas Morning News’ Michael Gehlken, Vander Esch had an MRI today on his neck. Ian Rapoport of NFL Network said Vander Esch would miss tomorrow’s practice because of a back problem, but we’re assuming both are talking about the same thing.</p>
      <p>Both reporters said Vander Esch is not expected to play this weekend.</p>

      <p>In nine games this season, Vander Esch has recorded 70 tackles, three passes defensed, a forced fumble and half of a sack.</p>
      <p>His numbers are down from last season, when he was a revelation as a rookie and earned Pro Bowl and second team All-Pro honors.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys and Patriots will square off at 4:25 p.m. ET Sunday on FOX.</p>
