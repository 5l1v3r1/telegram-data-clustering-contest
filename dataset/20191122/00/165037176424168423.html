        <b>Real Madrid coach, Zinedine Zidane, spoke in a press conference before the game against Real Sociedad, in which he assured that the signing of Portuguese José Mourinho by Tottenhm, who has been related on several occasions with a possible return to the white team, "does not matter" and does not make things "calmer".</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>"Quieter no, I don't mind. </b>i think the relationship that he has with our President is good, if that's the case. He (Florentino) has brought me here, as a player I've lived thanks to him in this great club and <b>I've already completed almost 18 years in this great club </b>and I will always be grateful to him," said the Frenchman.</p>
      <p>In addition, Zidane responded categorically when asked if he would only coach Real Madrid in the League: <b>"Yes. I'm white (he laughs), you either have this or you don't":</b></p>
