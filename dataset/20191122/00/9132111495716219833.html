      <p>Deputy Minister of Agriculture in charge of Horticulture, George Boahen Oduro has outlined plans put in place by the government of Ghana to ensure a reduction in the importation of rice.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview on Adom FM’s morning show Dwaso Nsem, Friday, the Deputy Minister said his outfit was working on an agreement to enable farmers buy from local millers in about two to three years.</p>
      <p>He added that the country ought to reach a level where it could produce the rice needed for local consumption.</p>
      <p>Rice producers in the country continue to struggle to break even as the country’s rice import increases annually.</p>
      <p>In some parts of the Northern and Upper East Regions, local farmers are losing their investments due to lack of ready-markets for their produce.</p>
      <p>The Minister also said the government was currently liaising with Agriculture extension officers and the Agriculture Directorates to assist with rice production in the country, further urging rice producers to contact their local assemblies to access the needed assistance, as it is the official channel through which government is implementing its agriculture initiative.</p>
