      <h1>Ireland Fans Will Have To Wait To Find Out Venue For Slovakia Playoff</h1>

      <p>Ireland will face Slovakia in a Euro 2020 playoff semi-final next March, but the venue for the game has still not been confirmed. While we know that Ireland will be away from home, which Slovakian city will host the match remains unknown.</p>
      <p>It is expected that the game will take place in the capital of Bratislava, but Slovakia have played all of their home qualifiers in Trnava. This was due to the fact a new stadium was being constructed in the capital, and it is expected the playoff will be moved to the new ground.</p>
      <p>That would be good news for Irish supporters. The newly-built Tehelne Pole stadium has a capacity of 22,500, 3,000 more than the venue in Trnava. You would assume this would mean more tickets for away supporters, who are guaranteed five per cent of the total capacity.</p>
      <p>Even if the game is in Trnava, it would not be disastrous. The city is only 50km from Bratislava, or 35 minutes via a rail link.</p>
      <p>An FAI spokesperson confirmed Bratislava as the likely venue, but said that we will not know for certain until some time next month.</p>
      <blockquote>Slovakia have intimated the game will take place in Bratislava but they have some final checks to make on the ground there before they can confirm it as the venue.<br/>We have also opened talks with them on the allocation of tickets and will update our fans as soon as we can.<br/>We are guaranteed five percent of the tickets but we are negotiating for more.<br/>Tickets will be allocated to supporters based on away attendance records from the last two campaigns.<br/>We will announce the application process as soon as we know our allocation.</blockquote>
      <p>With Slovakia failing to draw big crowds for their home qualifiers in recent times, there are strong hopes that Ireland's ticket allocation will be increased. There is sure to be plenty of demand.</p>
      <p>Should Ireland win that game, they will face a deciding playoff in Sarajevo or Belfast.</p>
