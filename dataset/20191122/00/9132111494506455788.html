      <p>Two Hundred and twenty-two (252) persons have lost their lives in road accidents in the Bono, Bono East, and Ahafo Regions from January to September to 2019.</p>
      <p>The figure is higher compared to the same period in 2018 where 188 persons lost their lives.</p>
      <p>The Bono, Bono East and Ahafo Regional Commander of the MTTD, Superintendent Stephen Sarfo Tenkorang disclosed the figures during the launch of National Road Safety Authority’s Road Safety Education and Training Programme for Commercial Drivers under the Presidential Special Initiative in Sunyani under the theme: “Stop Road Accidents Now Arrive Alive.”</p>
      <p>“When you look at our statistics, comparing last year from January to September; that is from first quarter to third quarter of last year and same period this year you will realize that the total accidents that were recorded within the Bono, Bono East, and Ahafo Regions we recorded 367 in 2018 and 494 in 2019 within the same period. That means the rate has gone up”.</p>
      <p>However, the national figures have dropped, showing that efforts by stakeholders to reduce the increasing spate of road accidents have started showing positive results as the number of commuters killed in road traffic accidents between January and September 2019 has dropped by 7.6%.</p>
      <p>Road accidents: 696 die in 2019 first quarter</p>
      <p>The number of road users killed in the first quarter of 2019 recorded a 17.57% increase over figures for the first quarter of 2018.</p>
      <p>Commuters and pedestrians killed increased from 592 in the first quarter of 2018 to 696 in the same period of 2019.</p>
      <p>The number of males killed amounted to 506, comprising 62 males below 18 years and 444 males above 18 years.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the number of females killed was 190, made up of 55 females below 18 years and 135 above 18 years.</p>
