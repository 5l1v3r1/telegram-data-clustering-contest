      <p><i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</i> may be dominating the conversation where Activision’s major shooter franchise is concerned, but there’s another, surprisingly competent mobile port that’s simmering there in the background as well. <i>Call of Duty Mobile</i> just announced that it’s going to get a major update with two of its most-request features in two: full controller support and zombies. Technically you can already use a controller in <i>Call of Duty Mobile</i> via a roundabout official PC emulator, but this is going to significantly simplify the process. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDutyMobile/comments/dzm5zj/it_is_nearly_time_to_begin_the_horde_is_coming/f88jrb5/">The team announced the new features in a Reddit post</a>. They’ll arrive with an update at 12:00 AM Eastern time, November 23. Here are some international launch times:</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The post also talks about the new battle pass, which will be coming our way on November 25, though there aren’t many new details on that yet.</p>
      <p>I’m excited: <i>Call of Duty Mobile</i> might be understandably a little bit less involved than its big sibling over on console, but it’s a pleasing way to while away some time and a relatively successful translation of what can make Call of Duty essentially satisfying. And zombies fits right into that: I’m a PvE player before I’m a PvP player, for the most part, and I hope that the mobile version of that experience can scratch that itch while I’m watching <i>Great British Baking Show</i>, or whatever.</p>
      <p>I am curious as to how the game is going to handle controllers where matchmaking is concerned, however. A controller offers a benefit over touchscreen controls, just like mouse and keyboard offers a benefit over a controller. <i>Fortnite</i> has been messing around with how to do matchmaking across a range of inputs for a while now, recently deciding to move away from strict input-based matchmaking and towards skill-based matchmaking, meaning that people with touchscreens might come up against mouse and keyboard users, but only if they’re good enough to pose a theoretical challenge.</p>
      <p>There may come a time when we’re all just streaming console-style games to our phones, but it’s clear that that time isn’t happening yet. Until then, I’m more than happy to play simpler experiences geared for touchscreen controls.</p>
