      <h1>Why Better Communication Across IT Is The Key To A More Secure Public Sector</h1>

      <p>The reality of today’s connected era means that all organisations are now working with an unprecedented amount of digital data. This data has value, to the organizations that process and store it, and to cyber-attackers. Regardless of where you are in your digital transformation journey, or the nature or size of your business, you are vulnerable to cyber-threats and need to be aware and prepared. </p>

      <p>The public sector holds a unique kind of information. It is not so much about intellectual property and corporate secrets, but about personal, sensitive and nation-state critical data. As more operational and vital citizen services move online and into the cloud, the volume of highly valuable data increases. The digitisation of the UK’s public sector, from healthcare and education to national and local government has unfortunately become an exciting opportunity for cyber-criminals, lured by the prospect of large amounts of records containing precisely the kinds of information that can make them rich. From names, addresses, National Insurance numbers, tax returns and medical records all the way to private political emails and state secrets. You get the idea. If this information fell into the wrong hands the ramifications could be serious. </p>
      <p>We know that the public sector treats its data with care, but we also know that the activities of the public sector are varied and complex and that, in common with many organisations and businesses, IT security has to juggle for time and attention among busy frontline staff. </p>
      <p>The key principles of cyber security best practice will always be the same, whether an organisation is in the public or private sector. Fundamentally there needs to be a robust plan in place that takes into account the full breadth of technologies being used, who uses them, who has access to them, and where the key vulnerabilities are. Crucially, this plan needs to be understood and adhered to by everyone in an organisation. Particularly the IT team itself.</p>
      <p>Recent research commissioned by Sophos has uncovered a significant gap between the risk awareness of senior IT professionals working in the public sector and their frontline IT teams. A worrying 55 percent of public sector IT leaders believe their organisations’ data is less valuable that private sector data, despite its highly sensitive nature and value to cyber criminals. Only one in five public sector IT administrators and practitioners share this view. </p>
      <p>Why does this matter?</p>
      <p>You may wonder if this perception gap around the value of data is likely to have any impact on the security of the public sector organisations in question. Sadly, I believe it will. </p>
      <p>It is of critical importance to an organisation’s security that those working within it fully understand what data they hold, where this data is kept and, consequently, how it should be protected.  A fundamental part of this is a full appreciation of that data’s intrinsic value. Without this awareness, vulnerabilities are exacerbated, and cyber criminals may find their job far easier than we would wish. Misperceptions about the nature and value of data held in the public sector also reveals a worrying likelihood that there will be other misperceptions in how its security plan is implemented. </p>
      <p>Sure enough, the same research also revealed that the majority of senior IT professionals in the public sector (76 percent) said their organisation had been affected by a ransomware incident over the past year - while only 16 percent of IT practitioners were aware of such incidents. Furthermore, 45 percent of IT leaders also said that there had been a large increase in both IT security incidents and actual breaches (38 percent) – compared to a far lower four and eight percent respectively among IT practitioners.  </p>
      <p>This is deeply concerning. If frontline staff underestimate the likelihood of a cyber-attack, they are far more likely to be complacent about the level of risk they face in their day to day activities. As cyber security professionals are all too aware, complacency is the enemy of security. </p>
      <p>The results raise another interesting question: which group has the more accurate view?  Do the senior leaders have access to more information about incidents and therefore a wider scope of view, or do they have a misperception around actual numbers? Do frontline staff have limited visibility or a more realistic grasp of what they see every day?  Whatever the answer, between the ‘it pours all the time’ and ‘it sometimes rains’, who decides about the umbrellas?</p>
      <p>Speak more, speak often</p>
      <p>These research findings highlight a significant factor right across the British public sector when it comes to securing the data it holds - the need for good, clear communication within IT. </p>
      <p>It is not discussed often enough in my opinion, but good planning and good communication go hand in hand. However effective it may be, a plan is worth nothing if the reason for its existence is not fully understood and it is not adhered to by everybody. This is, typically, how security breaches happen. Not because of malicious actions or flagrant lack of adherence to rules and regulations, but because of ignorance and lack of understanding about risk and how a cyber-attack typically happens. This can largely be addressed with an effective communications strategy that educates, informs and empowers IT and security staff to make the best decisions.</p>
      <p>The public sector is well aware of the cyber-security implications of the digital technologies and data it now works with. Highly skilled IT professionals are working throughout the sector to protect this data and are doing their utmost to ensure that staff follow best practice advice. This advice will only be heeded, however, if it is effectively communicated and clearly understood. </p>
      <p>Good communication and better levels of understanding are going to be key to making the vital changes needed right across the public sector. It is always going to be challenging to accomplish this, but it is achievable, and the results will speak for themselves. To quote Sheryl Sandberg, “We cannot change what we are not aware of, and once we are aware, we cannot help but change.”</p>
