      <h1>Facebook Dating lets users show Stories on their profiles</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/bradley-prior" target="_blank">Bradley Prior</a></address>
      <p>Facebook will let users display content from their Facebook or Instagram stories to populate their Facebook Dating profiles, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/21/facebook-dating-stories/"><b>Engadget</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>These Stories will be viewable to other users as long as one party hasn’t blocked or passed on the other.</p>
      <p>Using this feature will not change users’ settings across their Facebook or Instagram accounts – meaning that users won’t have to compromise their privacy on other platforms to use this feature.</p>
      <p>Tinder already lets Snapchat users add their Snapchat Stories to their profiles, and it has also allowed users to link their Instagram account to their Tinder profile.</p>
      <h3>Facebook Dating</h3>
      <p>Facebook launched its dating platform in August 2019 as competition to the popular Tinder dating app.</p>
      <p>Unlike Tinder, Facebook Dating doesn’t rely on users swiping left or right; instead, users are able to comment directly on another user’s profile or press the Like button to let them know that they would like to engage further.</p>
      <p>Facebook Dating will not match you with any of your Facebook friends unless you have both tagged each other as secret crushes.</p>
      <p>The platform also does not offer any equivalent paid plans to Tinder’s Gold product, meaning that all features are available to all users.</p>
      <p>It also does not show adverts – Facebook is currently not monetising the product, and instead views it as a way to encourage more users to be active on the primary Facebook platform.</p>
