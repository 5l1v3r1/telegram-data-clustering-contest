      <h2>In April 1967, a fierce tornado hit our village. My dad had bought the house in a valley but the high school and one of my after school jobs was right up on the tornado’s trail. A man who I will never know saved my life. Our boss came out and asked all of us cashier’s to move away from the cashiers. We did. I was very curious. It sounded like a train was its size but we were the size of ants. The sound was deafening. He reached up and grabbed my arm and pulled me down. Thank God. When we stood after the deafening sound had subsided, all the glass that had been in the front windows of the large grocery store where we were, was now behind us in what used to be the meat section. The buses that had been parked across the street (20 or so full size buses), were gone. I would later find out that they had been thrown everywhere like toys. The high school no longer had a swimming pool area and worst of all, the other large grocery store had been destroyed. Feet away it had killed everyone in it. I walked home to ask my Mom if everyone was ok, changed my clothes and went out for the rest of the night to help. I heard later that my Dad has seen it in television. It was his bowling night. He had to walk home. There was immediate Marshal Law. Mom said that my dad came in and asked if everyone was okay and cried. He never cried. In fact he had taught me and maintained that I never cry...very Sicilian... but that night, we could have lost everyone in our family.</h2>
