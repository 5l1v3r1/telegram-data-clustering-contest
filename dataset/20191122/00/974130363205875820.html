      <p>After the victory against Montpellier, manager Andy Friend discussed the challenges they would face into the build up to the Toulouse game.</p>
      <blockquote>Unlike most teams, we don’t charter flights so we’ll be leaving on Thursday afternoon, catching a flight on Friday morning and getting there in the afternoon.<br/>It was interesting, I bumped into a Munster man this morning who was over at the Ospreys game and he was having a coffee at Knocknacarra coffee shop at 9.30 in the morning. I was thinking that we wouldn’t get back until 6 in the evening.<br/>We don’t have the luxury of doing that but in a weird way, that’s actually what builds this team. It makes you have character. You’ve got to have character and get on with things and when things don’t go your way – like injuries leading up to a game – it doesn’t bother you.</blockquote>
