      <p>The Municipal Chief Executive (MCE) for Ayawaso West Municipal Assembly has ahead of the December 17, 2019 referendum poll decided to host a durbar on Tuesday 26th of November 2019.<br/><br/>According to Hon. Sandra Owusu Ahinkorah, the durbar is to be used to interact with the public and the residents in her municipal Assembly on the proposed amendment of the law that will give the electorates the power to elect their MMDCEs.<br/><br/>Speaking to Peacefmonline.com, the Ayawaso West MCE said that the occasion will be used to explain to the people of her Municipal Assembly the meaning of 'Yes' and "No' vote and thus, the need for them to vote for 'Yes' on December 17, 2019.<br/><br/>The intended venue for the durbar on 26th November 2019 is La Bawaleshie School Park at 2 pm.<br/><br/>"I will use the occasion to interact with the public and residents of my Assembly on the proposed amendment of the constitution that will now give electorates the power to select their MMDCEs", she averred.<br/><br/>She reiterated that "I look forward to seeing all of you who believe in deepening our democracy"’<br/><br/>She says this referendum is not about voting 'Yes' for the president to continue to appoint MMDCEs but rather allowing the review of article 243(1) currently before parliament that will take away the President's power to appoint.<br/><br/>"It is whether it should be contested on the partisan basis or not is what we are voting for", she explained.<br/>She, however, assured that the durbar will be a very fruitful interaction, hoping that her residents will vote emphatic 'Yes' on December 17, 2019.
