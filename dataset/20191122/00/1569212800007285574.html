In other words, sales teams using SalesLoft will now have the most up to date information on their sales leads’ and prospects’ current roles via LinkedIn’s Sales Navigator. “Ultimately, this saves time spent reviewing customer data manually, and it will increase the quality of all opportunities as salespeople progress through the buying cycle,” said SalesLoft CMO Sydney Sloan. </p>
