      <p>Many of my clients have wanted help in meeting their special someone. These tips have been the most potent.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Meeting</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Online is usually best. </i>Of course, there’s dissembling online (as well as in life) but compared with the other ways of meeting, online has most often worked best. That’s not surprising because it’s so easy to curate and because most busy (read, successful, broadly defined) people don’t have the time for more time-consuming ways to meet.</p>
      <p>The keys to successful <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/social-networking">online dating</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be not hypey but honest in words and pictures about your strengths, weaknesses, and preferences. The game isn't “Who can get the most queries.” It’s “Who can get on-target queries.”</li>
        <li>Have high standards and if you sense the person isn't right for you, cut your losses quickly—There <i>are </i>lots of fish in the sea.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here are <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-do-life/201911/online-dating">more tips on online dating.</a></p>
      <p><i>Getting set up. </i>The second most likely way to meet a special someone is getting set-up by friends and relatives you respect. They know you and care about you and generally curate well, certainly better than if you went to a club, bar, or singles event. Try to overcome any <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/shyness">shyness</a> about asking to get set up. Most people enjoy doing that.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Communicating</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s about balance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Revealing yourself and equally asking, listening, and following up about the other person.</li>
        <li>Moderate candor, especially in the beginning, probably not baring all. And yes, that probably applies to sexual communication. Slow really is better. . . usually.</li>
        <li>It’s a conversation not lecturettes. A rule of thumb: Most utterances should last 15 to 60 seconds.</li>
        <li>Slowly deepen the conversation, perhaps starting with interests at and outside work, family, and then values. Stay alert to signs you’re probing too much or too little, too quickly or not quickly enough. Here are <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-do-life/201902/probing">50 deepening questions.</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Evaluating wisely</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s easy to let those early months of infatuation cloud your thinking. My clients who have been most successful in love balance heart-driven feelings with head-driven thinking. Ongoing, they’re evaluating:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>sexual compatibility</li>
        <li>out-of-bed compatibility</li>
        <li>kindness</li>
        <li>emotional and financial self-sufficiency. A relationship is often devastated if one partner is high-maintenance. There’s resentment about the imbalance of power, of money, or of need for <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention">attention</a> and “processing.”</li>
        <li>whether the person brings out the best in you.</li>
        <li>the ineffable: Do you feel good around this person?</li>
        <li>the summative question: Are you better off monogamously with this person, being non-exclusive, or breaking up?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-do-life/201510/the-relationship-report-card">Here's more on rating your relationship.</a>
      </p>
      <p><i>Accept or leave. </i>My clients who are successful in love tend to not let a bad relationship dribble on. They either accept the person pretty much as-is or they leave. The chances of significantly “fixing” a person in a reasonable amount of time are too small. There <i>are </i>plenty fish in the sea. Accept or leave</p>
      <p>
        <b>Marry?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Even if kids are in the plan, the benefits of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/marriage">marriage</a> must be very carefully weighed against its shackles, not just legal shackles but family and friends’ expectations. In many circles, marriage is expected as is staying together except in extreme circumstances, even if you're not happy.</p>
      <p>I’ve seen many couples decide to marry and to stay married heavily because of external expectations. So this article would feel incomplete unless I <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stressed</a> the obvious: Marrying and staying married are too consequential to let norms pressure you. When you consider all the facts and the feelings, are you wise to publicly and legally commit to being coupled for a lifetime?</p>
      <p>Offering the other extreme is one of my most popular articles, with more than 171,000 views: <i><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-do-life/201410/the-recluse-option">The Recluse Option.</a></i></p>

        <b>The takeaway</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/relationships">Romantic relationships</a> can offer some of life’s highest highs and lowest lows. I hope this article’s ideas will tilt your prospects upward.</p>
