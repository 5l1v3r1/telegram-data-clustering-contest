        <b>Real Madrid star Eden Hazard has opened up on his slow start to life in the Spanish capital, admitting he arrived at the club overweight.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/e-hazard-21292">Eden Hazard</a> has confessed he arrived at <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a><b> overweight and struggled to adapt </b>in his first couple of months at the club.</p>
      <p>The Belgium international joined Madrid from Chelsea <b>in a reported €100million deal in June</b>, ending months of speculation over his future. Hazard's competitive debut was delayed by several weeks due to a muscle injury sustained in pre-season and<b> he did not get off the mark with his first goal until early October</b>. Former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger recently suggested <b>Hazard's weight gain was to blame for his slow start</b> and the 28-year-old has now admitted as much.</p>

      <p>"It's true," Hazard told L'Equipe.<b> "I'm not going to hide i</b>t. When I'm on vacation, I'm on vacation. I had put on five kilos, but <b>I'm the type of person who can lose it quickly</b> if I'm careful. When I was 18 at Lille, I was 72 or 73 kilograms. My muscle mass was 75kg, on a bad day 77kg. I was 80kg this summer, but<b> I lost it in 10 days</b>."</p>
      <p>Hazard, who has one goal and two assists in his first 11 appearances for Madrid, <b>claimed his performances are improving over time</b>.</p>
      <p><b>"I was not good enough,</b>" he said of his start to life in the Spanish capital. "I told myself to start playing well. The first two months were not good enough. I thought, 'I can do better'.<b> I've felt better for a month now</b> - I dribble, accelerate and try to make others play better. The first couple of months I reminded myself that I'm new and had to play simple.<b> There were too many passes</b> and people were waiting for me to dribble."</p>
