      <p>Finish this sentence for me: I will be happy when  _______________. </p>
      <p>How many times have you promised yourself this?</p>
      <p>When I was younger, I remember seeing phrases like these:</p>
      <p>
        <i>Don’t worry, be happy.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Being happy is the greatest level of success. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Life is short, choose happiness. </i>
      </p>
      <p>And while I believe those are all well-intentioned quotes, I think that sometimes we have an unrealistic view of happiness. </p>
      <p>In my own life, in times of confusion and struggle I often find myself saying “I just want to be happy again” or “I know things are headed in the right direction, but why am I not happy?”</p>
      <p>After doing a lot of reflecting, I realized that being happy shouldn’t be our ultimate goal. Rather, we should strive to be mindful of <i>all</i> our seasons of life, thoughts and emotions.</p>
      <p>Happiness is the one emotion that most of us give A LOT of weight to. But happiness is only the tip of the iceberg. <b>We experience a wide array of emotions that are perfectly valid and deserve our time and attention as well.</b></p>
      <p>If we <i>only want to be happy</i> and make achieving that the ultimate goal, we miss out on the full spectrum of life. </p>
      <p>Not to mention, expecting yourself to be happy all the time (no matter how great your life is!) puts unneeded pressure on yourself. It’s <i>human</i> to have ups, downs and somewhere-in-the-middle times – this doesn’t mean you are doing anything <i>wrong</i> – quite the opposite, it means you are having the human experience.</p>
      <p>Don’t get me wrong – feeling happy is wonderful and should be celebrated! However, achieving happiness shouldn’t be our <b>sole focus</b> because it tends to create unnecessary expectations for ourselves and our lives.</p>
      <p>So how do we put this into practice? The key is to shift our mindset and practice <b>awareness, curiosity and compassion</b> with all of our emotions:</p>
      <p><b>Awareness </b>of your current state. Is your stomach tight? Are you shoulders tense? Are you finding yourself mindlessly going about your day and at the end of it, having a hard time recalling what you did? Or perhaps the opposite – are you in a great mood? Maybe you had a fantastic night’s sleep and a relaxing morning yoga session. Take time to be aware of whatever is is you are feeling. Your body will give you cues.</p>
      <p><b>Curiosity </b>about your own thoughts and emotions. Often times we will jump to conclusions about our own thoughts and emotions. To be curious means to allow yourself to <a href="https://www.mindful-livingblog.com/home/separate-thoughts-from-judgement">explore them without judgement.</a> </p>
      <p><b>Compassion </b>towards yourself in all circumstances – the good, the bad and the in between. Repeat after me: You are only human. You’re allowed to feel great and you’re allowed to feel messy too. </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Key takeaways:</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>In making happiness our ultimate goal, we place unnecessary pressure on ourselves and may disregard other important emotions. </li>
        <li>Instead, we should practice awareness, curiosity and compassion towards the natural ups and downs of life. </li>
        <li>When we take the space to untangle our thoughts, we may discover that we are able to let go of less-than-stellar emotions much quicker than if we were to avoid them and keep pushing ourselves to be happy. </li>
      </ul>
