      <h1>Antonio Conte Admits He Offers Players Advice On Their Sex Lives</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Connaughton</a></address>
      <p>Antonio Conte has made an immediate impact since his arrival at Inter Milan. While they have had a couple of questionable results in the Champions League, their form in Serie A has been exemplary. They have taken 31 points from their first 12 games, with a draw against Parma and a loss to Inter the only blots on their copybook.</p>
      <p>Conte is known for making fast starts at new club, as evidenced by his time in England. The Italian led Chelsea to the Premier League in his maiden season, revolutionising the team by introducing a three defender system.</p>
      <p>He is hands on in his managerial approach, something that has created friction in his previous roles, especially with club boards. He has already made a few sniping comments about Inter's lack of transfer activity during the summer, but these are definitely his strangest comments yet.</p>
      <p>He was being interviewed by <i>L'Equipe</i> when he spoke about his players conserving their energy, admitting he even told them how to do so in their sex lives. He said he does not impose any sort of ban on the activity, but urges them to keep it short and sweet:</p>
      <blockquote>During the season, I advise my players to have sex for short periods and with the minimum of effort, and better use positions where they are under their partners.<br/>And preferably, with their wives, because if with others, well, that needs extra action.</blockquote>
      <p>Good man Antonio.</p>
