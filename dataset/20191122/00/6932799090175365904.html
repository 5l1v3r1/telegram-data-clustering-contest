        <b>PowerColor recently announced its RX 5700 XT Liquid Devil, a 5700 XT with an EK Waterblock straight out of the box. Priced at US$599, this liquid-cooled 5700 XT might just give the RTX 2070 Super a run for its money.</b>
      </p>
      <p>PowerColor recently announced the RX 5700 XT Liquid Devil, a specially binned 5700 XT with an EK waterblock strapped on. The Liquid Devil will be available through retail channels from November 25th onwards.</p>
      <p>According to PowerColor, the Liquid Devil will reach "record-breaking clocks and performance." A significant amount of custom work has gone into this card. PowerColor uses a new PCB designed for the Liquid Devil, featuring 10 VRMs and capable of handling over 300W of power. Only select, highly-binned 5700 XT GPUs are used to ensure that the Liquid Devil can stably hit higher clocks.</p>
      <p>PowerColor has stated that the Liquid Devil's Boost Clock is 2070 MHz. That's 165 MHz higher than the <a href="http://www.notebookcheck.com/AMD-Radeon-RX-5700-XT-Desktop-Grafikkarte-Benchmarks-und-Spezifikationen.428001.0.html">reference design</a>. OC'd 5700 XTs have been known to reach <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/ces5vg/rx_5700_xt_overclock/">2.1 GHz in-game</a>. We'd be very impressed if the 5700 XT Liquid Devil's binned GPU can OC past that. </p>
      <p>It's not just about performance. RGB fans rejoice: the Liquid Devil has multiple RGB LEDs around the chassis. It even comes with a multicolored dye pack for the cooling liquid.</p>
      <p>Value is a big question. At US$599, the Liquid Devil costs more than most custom 2070 Supers. Going by OC'd 5700 XT benchmarks, it does not seem likely that it'll trump even a stock 2070 Super in most games.</p>
      <p>But that's not the point, though. The Liquid Devil is a niche card aimed at AMD buyers who want the best performance possible from Navi. If that doesn't describe you, do yourself a favor and grab a 2070 Super. Or better yet, get hold of a 5700 for $300 and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/czhux1/psa_you_can_take_the_bios_from_a_5700_xt_and/eyygzx2/">flash it to a 5700 XT</a> for added performance.</p>
