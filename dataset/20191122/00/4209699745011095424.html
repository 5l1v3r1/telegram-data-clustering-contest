      <p>Ahmed Lawan, Nigeria's Senate President, has said he will do anything President Muhammadu Buhari requests of him in the Senate.<br/><br/>Lawan said this when the Chairman, Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption, Prof Itse Sagay (SAN), paid him a visit in Abuja on Thursday.<br/><br/>Sagay had appealed to the Senate President to ensure that Ibrahim Magu, Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, was confirmed as the substantive head of the agency.<br/><br/>In response, the Senate President said, “The confirmation of Acting Chairman of EFCC – there is no request before this Senate for the confirmation of the Acting Chairman of EFCC.<br/><br/>“This is a new Senate and therefore, until there is a request, there is nothing the Senate can do.<br/><br/>“I want to assure you that any request that comes from Mr President is a request that will make Nigeria a better place in terms of appointments or legislation and the Senate will act expeditiously to ensure that we play our part in the confirmation or passing of legislation appropriately.”<br/><br/>The Senate President said the lawmakers are “in a haste” to pass anti-corruption bills.<br/><br/>He added, “As far as we are concerned, those bills will have to come again and start to go through the process from the very beginning.<br/><br/>“We are ready; in fact, we are in haste if those bills are ready for us to start working on them.”</p>
