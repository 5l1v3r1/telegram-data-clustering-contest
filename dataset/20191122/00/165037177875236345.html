        <b>Barcelona were heavily linked with a return for Neymar but the players had no involvement in trying to bring him back, says Luis Suarez.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/l-suarez-29685/">Luis Suarez</a> says when <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/g-pique-23560/">Gerard Pique </a>speaks "<b>sometimes you have to take everything with tweezers</b>" after the defender said <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona">Barcelona</a> stars <b>were ready to alter their salaries</b> to accommodate the return of Neymar.</p>
      <p>Brazil star <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/neymar-64511/">Neymar</a> <b>was heavily linked with a switch back to Camp Nou</b> just two seasons after making a record-breaking €222million move to Paris Saint-Germain. However, Barca were unable to strike an agreement with PSG <b>despite the best efforts of LaLiga's champions.</b> Centre-back Pique said last month: "We didn't stump up money. What we said to the president was whether we could change our contracts <b>because we knew there was a Financial Fair Play issue</b>... so we said to the president, rather than earn something in year one, we could earn it in year two or three or four."</p>
      <p>Star forward Suarez, who formed a devastating trio with Lionel Messi and Neymar at Barca, <b>insists the players had no involvement with the talks</b> and believes not everything Pique said should be taken at face value.</p>
      <p>"When Geri speaks, sometimes you have to take everything with tweezers," Uruguayan Suarez told Sport. "<b>He has a lot of work and a lot of experience in making statements</b>. In this case he knows and is aware that the players were totally out in the case of Ney. <b>We were willing to welcome him </b>or any player who wants to come, but always oblivious to the case."</p>

      <p>Suarez also insisted<b> everything is well with close-season signing </b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/a-griezmann-32465">Antoine Griezmann </a>and his integration with Barcelona's squad. It was reported captain Messi objected to the signing of the former Atletico Madrid forward due to his desire for Neymar to return, although <b>the Argentinian branded such suggestions as a "lie"</b>.</p>
      <p>Suarez said: "[His integration has been] spectacular, sometimes things are misunderstood. B<b>oth Leo and I and Geri himself welcomed him a year earlier</b>, said he was a great player and was one of the best in the world. He came from being world champion and we already praised him. Then we didn't know what was going to happen to him, we weren't sure he was coming this year. <b>We treat him as one more</b>. It is also true that some have more affinity with some partners than others; <b>in his case he gets along very well with the French players</b>."</p>
