      <p>The capsule completed its slow crawl from its hangar at the Kennedy Space Center to a <a href="https://www.wftv.com/news/local/prepare-for-launch-starliner-crew-capsule-transported-to-launchpad/1010945189">launchpad</a> a few miles away at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.</p>
      <p>Next, the Starliner will be lifted by a crane and connected to an Atlas 5 rocket.</p>
      <p>NASA is paying Boeing $5 billion to design and build the Starliner to take astronauts back to the International Space Station.</p>
      <p>No astronauts will be on board its test flight to the ISS in December. The window for that launch that will open on Dec. 17. </p>
      <p>The Starliner could start taking astronauts to the space station as early as <a href="https://www.wftv.com/news/local/prepare-for-launch-starliner-crew-capsule-transported-to-launchpad/1010945189">2020</a>.</p>
