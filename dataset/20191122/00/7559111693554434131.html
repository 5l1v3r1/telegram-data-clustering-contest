      <p><b>REVIEW</b> – I love my Apple Watch, and one reason is how easy it is to change bands. I like being able to switch bands based on my mood or activity. I’m also kind of addicted to collecting them. Recently I’ve been testing a couple of bands from Monowear. They were kind enough to send me both their Urban Canvas and Cocktail leather Apple Watch bands. I’ve been wearing them both extensively for the past couple of weeks. Here are my thoughts on each. </p>
      <h3>What is it?</h3>
      <p>The Monowear Urban Canvas Apple Watch band is a canvas band made for the Apple Watch. The Cocktail Leather Apple Watch band is a silky leather band made for the Apple Watch.</p>
      <h3>Design and features</h3>
      <h4>Urban Canvas band</h4>

      <p>The Urban Canvas band features a durable outer layer made of canvas. The band is available in Vintage Red, Denim Blue, and Plaid Gray. I chose to go with Plaid Gray because I felt it would go with everything. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>The band’s outer layer is made of durable canvas, which is bonded to a genuine leather inner layer. The canvas fabric protects against the elements and gives the band a rugged casual look. Perfect for the fall and winter. The band’s inner lining is made of soft leather, which makes it instantly comfortable against your skin.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The band’s plug buckle closure is similar to that of the Apple Watch sport band, making it easy to put on and take off. It also gives the band a clean look and slim profile. The band’s wide loop has a leather patch featuring the Monowear logo. The leather matches the leather on the inside of the band and will patina nicely over time.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>A tapered plug end ensures that the loop will not slide off. The matte dark gray adaptor perfectly matches my space gray Apple Watch. Other adaptor colors include Silver Aluminum, Gold, and Silver Stainless Steel.</p>

      <h4>Cocktail Leather band</h4>
      <figure>

      <p>At first glance, the Cocktail Leather band looks like a simple black leather band. But closer examination reveals the Cocktail leathers silky, water-resistant finish.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The silky finish and tapered end give the band a look of casual elegance. The inner layer is soft leather, like the Urban Canvas band.</p>

      <p>The Silky Tuxedo color, matte dark gray layered buckle, and matching adaptor add to the band’s elegant look.</p>

      <p>The Cocktail Leather band is also available in Silky Midnight and Silky Sangria. The choice of adaptor colors is the same as the Urban Canvas band.</p>

      <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
      <p>I like both of these bands a lot. They’re lightweight, extremely comfortable, and well constructed. And at under $50 each, pretty affordable. Monowear will certainly be on my radar the next time I look to add to my Apple Watch band collection. </p>
