        <b>Real Madrid made public the list of 19 players who have been selected for the match on 23rd November against Real Sociedad, for the matchday 14 encounter at the Santiago Bernabeu.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>We know now the 19 players called up</b> by <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a> for the home game against Real Sociedad in La Liga. Zidane has <b>decided to leave out the young Brazilian striker</b> <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/isco-44027/">Vinicius</a>. </p>
      <p>Despite the fact the Brazil international<b> has been training under 'Zizou' during the entire international break,</b> he has finally missed out on the squad for the game at the Bernabeu. </p>
      <p>The French coach has decided to go for the Welsh international <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/g-bale-72/">Gareth Bale</a>,<b> despite the fact the striker is in the midst of a controversy</b> because of that famous 'Wales, Golf, Madrid' flag. </p>
      <p>As well as Vinicius, <b>Odriozola, Mariano and Brahim have also been left out</b> of the squad for tactical reasons.<b> Not even the absence of Lucas Vazquez </b>has given the Brazilian a chance to play. </p>
