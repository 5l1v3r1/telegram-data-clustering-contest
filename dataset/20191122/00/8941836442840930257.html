      <h1>Franklin Graham: Chick-fil-A CEO ‘assured me’ company R</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/jessica-chasmar/" target="_blank">Jessica Chasmar</a></address>
      <p>Evangelist <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/franklin-graham/">Franklin Graham</a> said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> CEO <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dan-cathy/">Dan Cathy</a> personally assured him that the company “remains committed to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christian-athletes/">Christian</a> values” after sparking backlash this week for ending donations to several <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christian-athletes/">Christian</a> charities.</p>
      <p>“Has <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> caved?” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/franklin-graham/">Mr. Graham</a> wrote in a Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FranklinGraham/posts/2856365114419651?__xts__[0]=68.ARCxnOgXCoMYTFzUU_YFI0K5QnO-EnXzvFs3rUleXkHHdJa6mbCfJO35AIx3tfssYyqMuznHPHthRztoIOrwcUmcikXyq4FcA-XK4R1x3ieMIMtW5zL8rvt1UKOl42BVeZzW4AHvlrJjUNJjcstQzsRbz5AdgJlrt1M9Jx7WpCNwAMgelwt8CqVypTgwdNiX24ogRQDVWZS58z-G5iofXnzrRWTuyr2PhHrJjKkHqDItOH5IN0odAnLwHnB2kxDZymQr_YKz1pvul718Tj2b2nbOQmzea5pW94b7alLwHaFnsJGHlOO3mDeqTyebNRdhct6NJMG5rWfa1ZovGgF_AQ&amp;__tn__=-R">post</a> Thursday. “I picked up the phone and called <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dan-cathy/">Dan Cathy</a>.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> outraged conservatives on Monday after announcing they were ending donations to Fellowship of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christian-athletes/">Christian Athletes</a>, The Salvation Army and Paul Anderson Youth Homes following years of criticism from the LGBTQ community for donating to faith-based groups that support traditional marriage.</p>
      <p>Despite the company’s efforts, several major LGBTQ advocacy organizations still aren’t happy and demand that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> also change their corporate anti-discrimination policy and apologize for past donating practices.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/franklin-graham/">Mr. Graham</a>, the 67-year-old son of the late televangelist Billy Graham, said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dan-cathy/">Mr. Cathy</a> “was very clear” in saying that the company did not bow “down to anyone’s demands, including the LGBTQ community.”</p>

      <p>“They will continue to support whoever they want to support,” he wrote. “They haven’t changed who they are or what they believe. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> remains committed to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christian-athletes/">Christian</a> values. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dan-cathy/">Dan Cathy</a> assured me that this isn’t going to change. I hope all those who jumped to the wrong conclusion about them read this.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/franklin-graham/">Mr. Graham</a> went on to argue that the LGBTQ community will never be satisfied with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chick-fil-a/">Chick-fil-A</a> because of their “hatred” for the company founder’s “strong stand for biblical ‘traditional’ values and his desire to honor God.”</p>
