      <p>MTN Mobile Money (Momo) user, Richmond Asamoah, has been apprehended by residents of Berekum as he attempted to defraud an operator by loading his wallet with what is suspected to be fake currency.</p>
      <p>The momo operator, Emmanuel Owusu, told Adom News in an interview that the suspect engaged him in a heated argument when he pointed out to him that the features of his money made them fake.</p>
      <p>“He came to my shop to load GHc500 but as I took my pen to write down his number I noticed the notes were fake because they didn’t have the same features as the other notes but he begun to argue with me,” he said.</p>
      <p>The arguments, according to Emmanuel, attracted eyewitnesses to the scene who asked for the notes for authentication, and lo and behold, they were indeed fake.</p>
      <p>The agitated eyewitnesses who couldn’t help the situation, apprehended and bundled Richmond into a taxi and handed him over to the police who are currently investigating the issue.</p>
