      <p>Elton John has recalled the time George Harrison told him to ‘stop putting marching powder up his nose’.</p>
      <p>The 72-year-old has recently addressed his former cocaine addiction in his new autobiography, Me: Elton John.</p>
      <p>And when talking to <a href="http://www.virginradio.co.uk/">Chris Evans on his Virgin Radio Breakfast Show</a>, the father-of-two confessed that the infamous Beatles star had advised him to put down the Class A drug.</p>
      <p>Chatting to the host, the Honky Cat hitmaker dished up some advice to struggling musicians, before turning his attention to the late singer.</p>
      <p>‘You’ve got to play live,’ the Rocketman insisted: ‘If you want to have a career, record sales will go up and down and people are so fickle.</p>
      <p>‘Now, when you’re young, they’ll drop you like a five-pound note on the floor and you’ve got to be able to play live and believe in yourself, but play live.’</p>

      <p>Chris pressed: ‘Okay. And the best piece of advice George Harrison gave you.’</p>

      <p>Pausing for a moment, Elton laughed: ‘Stop putting that marching powder up your nose.’</p>
      <p>Chuckling along with the star, Chris quizzed Elton over his sobriety as he asked: ‘How long’s it been now? How long’s it been?’</p>
      <p>‘Twenty-nine years,’ the living legend proudly replied as he joked: ‘The nose is still here!’</p>

      <p>This isn’t the first time he’s spoken about his substance abuse, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/08/elton-john-reveals-cocaine-binges-left-monster-addresses-use-horrible-drug-10883891/">as Elton wrote about it in his recent memoir.</a></p>
      <p>Speaking of a period in mid-1983 when he was filming his I’m Still Standing music video, he recalled being told he’d smashed up his entire hotel suite. Only he didn’t remember a thing.</p>
      <p>‘Everything else was on its side, or upside down, or in pieces. Sitting among the splinters was a cowboy hat that [personal assistant] Bob liked to wear. It was completely flat, like Yosemite Sam’s after Bugs Bunny drops an anvil on his head,’ he wrote of his PA waking up him to survey the damage.</p>
      <p>‘”F***ing hell,” I said. “What happened?” There was a long pause. “Elton,” he said eventually. “You happened”.’</p>
      <p>Elton revealed the shoot in Cannes kicked off at 4am, before wrapping at sunset with the crooner going back to his room before the night schedule began. It was there he bumped into Duran Duran’s Simon Le Bon and joined him for a drink at the bar.</p>

      <p>After downing ‘either six or eight vodka martinis in the space of an hour, and a couple of lines of coke’, Elton returned to set where he ‘started rolling around on the floor naked’ before punching his then-manager John Reid.</p>
