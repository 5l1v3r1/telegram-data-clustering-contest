      <p>Battle lines are drawn for the byelections to the 15 Assembly Constituencies as withdrawal of nomination papers ended on Thursday. <br/><br/>From Friday, all political leaders including Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa are set to take a plunge into poll campaigns for the next two weeks. Elections are due to be held on December 5. <br/><br/>The byelections were necessitated following disqualification of Congress and the JD(S) MLAs. In two Constituencies in Maski and RR Nagar, the polls are not being held due to pending poll petitions before the Karnataka High Court. The outcome of the byelections will determine the longevity of the BJP government. Being aware of this, the Chief Minister has already tasked all his Cabinet colleagues to either ensure victory of party candidates or lose their Ministerial posts. Yediyurappa, who was busy strategising for the polls for the last one week, is set to take a whirlwind tour of the 15 Assembly segments from Friday while BJP Karnataka President Nalinkumar Kateel, other senior leaders and Union Ministers are also set to campaign in the intensely fought polls. The Chief Minister has already put all his Ministers in charge of specific Constituencies. <br/><br/><b>Cong, a divided house</b> <br/><br/>Senior party leaders upset with Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah are not actively seen taking part in the byelections. The party looks like a divided house with senior leaders showing no interest to take part in the elections. A few senior leaders are campaigning on their own keeping a safe distance from Siddaramaiah and KPCC president Dinesh Gundurao. <br/><br/>Former minister DK Shivakumar has his own team and is touring independently, campaigning for party candidates of his choice. On the other hand, Siddaramaiah too is campaigning alone as no seniors were willing to go with him. <br/><br/><b>2 JD(S) candidates out<br/></b><br/><br/>Meanwhile, two JD(S) candidates have withdrawn from the fray leaving the party embarrassed without anyone in the contest. Pontiff Shivalinga Shivacharya of Kabbinada Kanti Mutta, who had filed his nomination papers as a JD(S) candidate from Hirekerur, withdrew from the fray due to reported pressure tactics by the BJP. <br/><br/>For the last four days, BY Raghavendra, Shivamogga Lok Sabha BJP member and son of the Chief Minister, was making an all-out effort to persuade the swamiji to withdraw from the fray. A few Lingayat Mutt heads are also said to have coaxed the JD(S) candidate to withdraw. <br/><br/><br/>In Athani, Guru Dushyala, an independent backed by the JD(S) too withdrew after being persuaded by Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi. In Gokak, several BJP leaders made a futile attempt to pressurise JD(S) candidate Ashok Poojari to withdraw from the contest. BJP leaders like Umesh Katti were stopped by Poojariâ€™s supporters and not allowed to enter his residence. The withdrawal of these two candidates is likely to help the consolidation of Lingayat votes in favour of the BJP.</p>
