        <b>Frank Lampard's work at Chelsea has been hailed by David Silva, who claims his former team-mate's managerial potential was clear to see.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a>'s David Silva has not been surprised by the positive impact<b> Frank Lampard </b>has had at <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/chelsea-fc">Chelsea </a>since taking over as head coach.</p>
      <p>Chelsea face <b>defending Premier League champions City at the Etihad Stadium </b>on Saturday, and head into the fixture a point and a place ahead of Pep Guardiola's side.</p>
      <p>While City lost 3-1 to leaders Liverpool last time out,<b> Chelsea have won their past six Premier League outings.</b></p>
      <p>Silva played alongside Lampard at City in 2014-15 after the former England midfielder ended a 13-year playing stint at Chelsea and says he could spot the managerial potential immediately.</p>
      <p><b>"I could see a manager in him when he was here</b>. He was an incredible player, a world-class player," said Silva, who will bring his City career to an end after this season.</p>
      <p>"The way he played, as well as his experience in football, now he transmits it to his players. <b>He is showing it already, he is going to be a fantastic manager".</b></p>
      <p>"I'm not surprised [how well he's done so quickly]. <b>He has clear ideas and he is doing very well.</b> What matters is that he has been given the opportunity and he's making the most of it."</p>
      <p>With Chelsea serving a transfer ban, Lampard has been praised for his willingness to utilise the Blues' youngsters, with<b> Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori</b> all particularly impressive, while <b>Christian Pulisic</b> has begun to shine in recent matches.</p>

      <p><b>City trail league leaders Liverpool by nine points, </b>but Silva insists Chelsea must also be considered as contenders in the Premier League title race.</p>
      <p>"I think so. Even though it's Lampard's first season, <b>they are playing really well,</b>" Silva added.</p>
      <p><b>"They are there in the title race</b>. It will be a beautiful game: two attacking teams that want to keep the ball and score goals. It's going to be an entertaining game for the fans".</p>
      <p>"Abraham is playing really well, like the rest of his team.<b> They have players that they are doing really well and helping him".</b></p>
      <p><b>"They have also a bunch of young players</b> and, when the team plays well, it's always easier for them to shine."</p>
      <p>Silva also stressed the importance of<b> City immediately recovering from their defeat </b>at Anfield last time out.</p>
      <p>"We are nine points behind.<b> We need to focus on ourselves, try to win every game</b> and we will see what happens at the end of the season," said Silva, who has won four Premier League titles with City.Â </p>
      <p>"I think we are in good form, in spite of some bad results<b>. Liverpool are doing very well; that's why there is a big gap between us</b>. This is not the first time we have been so far off the top of the table".</p>
      <p>"We have had this gap in other seasons, even with less games left, and<b> we managed to win the championship in the end</b>. We need to remain calm and focus on our games."</p>
