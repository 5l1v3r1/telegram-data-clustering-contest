      <p>General Secretary of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Johnson Asiedu Nketia, has noted that claims by the New Patriotic Party (NPP) that it invited the NDC to deliberate on the referendum is a lie.</p>
      <p>According to the NPP, a meeting was held in the Jubilee House on June 10, 2019 in which a comprehensive deliberation on the referendum was made to which all political parties present were in an agreement to a ‘Yes’ vote to the referendum.</p>
      <p>The NPP claimed that the NDC was represented by Mr Nketia, in the meeting held at the Jubilee House.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the claim in an interview on Joy News’ PM Express, Mr Nketia said nobody has tried to invite the NDC to discuss the issue of referendum anywhere.</p>
      <p>“On the referendum issue I’m saying that, nobody whether in government or at the party level has sort to invite us to sit anywhere to try and look at the issue in a bi-partisan manner and if they are interested in building a consensus, this is the wrong way to go about it,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said the last time he was at the Jubilee House was in 2017 to celebrate the 25th Silver Jubilee Anniversary of the 4th Republic.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the NPP’s invitation to have a discussion to rescind the party’s ‘No’ decision, Mr Nketia said that the NPP must first apologise for claiming to have engaged them (NDC) in a discussion concerning the referendum when they had not done so.</p>
