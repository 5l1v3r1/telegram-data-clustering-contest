      <p>CAIRO - 22 November 2019: The cabinet media center denied reports circulated about the Suez Canal Authority’s intention to increase the international waterway’s transit tolls by five percent for oil tankers with a total cargo of more than 20,000 tons. <br/><br/>The center said in a statement Friday that it has contacted the Suez Canal Authority, which totally dismissed these reports, stressing that the transit tolls are the same as they have been for five years. <br/><br/>The authority added that it is keen to make the Suez Canal more competitive with alternative routes, noting that any hike in transit tolls is only imposed after extensive studies and is announced with absolute transparency.</p>
