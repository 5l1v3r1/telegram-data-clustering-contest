      <p>A Muslim woman slammed Boris Johnson for warping people's view of her by comparing the burqa she wears to a 'letterbox.'</p>
      <p>The Question Time audience member, who was wearing the traditional Islamic garment, questioned how she could have faith in the Prime Minister after his offensive remarks.</p>
      <p>The English teacher said she is seen as oppressed and foreign because she dons the burqa, during her passionate rant on the BBC programme.</p>
      <p>She added: "When you look at me what do you think? You think of a letterbox, because that's exactly what he ( <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Mr Johnson</a> ) said in an article.</p>
      <p>"He mentioned women like me who wear the burqa alongside people who wear balaclavas. I'm an English teacher. You see me as oppressed, you see me as someone who probably doesn't speak English because she's got a veil on her face.</p>

      <p>"I've got a degree in English. I teach my pupils about politics, about mutual respect, tolerance, all the brilliant fundamental British values. But how can I put my faith in a leader when that same leader likens me to a letterbox?"</p>
      <p>During her tirade, she was interrupted by another audience member who shouted 'I see you as a human being'.</p>
      <p>Panelist Robert Jenrick, the Housing Secretary, said <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> 's controversial article actually supported women's right to choose what they want to wear.</p>
      <p>He added that the Tories are investigating racism and discrimination - and have a zero-tolerance policy within the party.</p>
      <p>Liberal Democrat MP Chuka Umunna, a former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> shadow cabinet member, blasted Mr Jenrick for his attempt to justify Mr Johnson's comments.</p>

      <p>He said the Prime Minister had 'form' on prejudice and hate, pointing to his description of black people as having 'watermelon smiles and being piccaninnies'.</p>
      <p>Mr Umunna branded Mr Johnson's 'letterbox' burqa comparison as 'some of the most grossly offensive remarks I've ever heard a senior politician come out with'.</p>
      <p>The Muslim woman who criticised the Prime Minister received widespread support on social media.</p>
      <p>One <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> user said: "Woman on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bbcqt?src=hashtag_click">#bbcqt</a> in burqa talking about Islamophobia getting shouted down by dreadful people in the audience, shameful."</p>
      <p>Another added: "The woman with a burqa on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bbcqt?src=hashtag_click">#bbcqt</a> is incredibly brave to speak out against Boris Johnson's racism.</p>
      <p>"The response from the audience is disgusting."</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister said it was 'absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letterboxes' in a Daily Telegraph article last year.</p>
