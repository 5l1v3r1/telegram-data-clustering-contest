      <p>The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has analysed data from Roy Morgan research and found that 48% of Australian children aged six to 13 now own or use a mobile phone.</p>
      <p>The figure has risen steadily since 2014 (39%), which was down slightly on 2013 (41%). The latest figure was heavily weighted towards older children: in 2018 some 80% of children aged 12-13 owned or used a mobile.</p>
      <p>ACMA says its analysis shows that in 2018 some 32% of children owned a mobile phone, while a further 16% had access to one, and 25% of children aged six to seven had or used a mobile phone.</p>
      <p>“The most common reasons for kids to reach for their phones were to play games (70%), take photos and/or videos (67%), use apps (64%) or call their parents or family (57%),” ACMA said.</p>
      <p>The research has been published on the ACMA website.</p>
