      <p> </p>
      <p>CHAIRMAN and Chief Executive of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Col Muhammad Abdallah (rtd) has said the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Command of the agency has intercepted 1.115 tons of Cannabis Sativa at its outpost in Gwagwalada. It was concealed in a truck with registration number KBT 391 XA, col. Abdallah said.</p>
      <p>He said 179 drug merchants were also arrested.</p>
      <p>Speaking when the Wuse Zone Four Traders Association, paid him an appreciation visit at the NDLEA headquarters in Abuja yesterday, Abdallah said they were determined to sustain current efforts aimed at preventing the influx of drugs into the FCT.</p>
      <p>According to him, part of their strategies in this regard was the strengthening of their vigilance at the entry points to the FCT such that drug consignments on transit are intercepted even before they are moved into the city.</p>
      <p>The Chairman also said that in partnership with other law enforcement agencies they had launched “Operation Shara” where they deployed a special squad that went into aggressive intelligence gathering, round-the-clock patrols and sting operations and the outcome has brought respite to the residents of the FCT.</p>

      <p>He reinstated the agency’s position on zero tolerance drug activities anywhere in the country, saying they were determined to do more.</p>
      <p>He said the successes they have been able to record was as a result of the synergy between law enforcement agencies and other stakeholders.</p>
