      <p>​Burnley fans were reported for alleged hate crimes, including racism, more than any other club in England and Wales over the past two seasons.</p>
      <p>The issues of hate crimes have plagued English football in recent years, with numerous clubs all forced to address various allegations or abuse.</p>

      <p>However, as noted by the Home Office (via <a href="https://twitter.com/PAdugout/status/1197424406659682304?s=20">​PA</a>), <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/burnley">​Burnley</a> fans have been reported for more hate crimes than any other side, having been accused of a total of 17 counts of abuse since the start of the 2017/18 campaign.</p>
      <p>15 of those allegations were based on racist abuse, while the two remaining cases were accusations of abuse relating to sexual orientation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">​Manchester United</a>, Sunderland and <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/west-ham">​West Ham</a> were all reported for 13 different incidents. For United, nine were related to race, three were linked to sexual orientation and one to religion.</p>

      <p>As for the Hammers, six of their reports concerned racial abuse, four related to religion and three to sexual orientation. Sunderland fans faced 12 allegations of racism - the second highest total in the UK - while there was also one incident of abuse related to sexual orientation.</p>
      <p>The results also did not make for pretty reading for <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/chelsea">​Chelsea</a>, <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/leeds">​Leeds United</a> and <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/leicester">​Leicester City</a>, all of whom have faced ten reports of various hate crimes in the last two seasons.</p>
      <p>For Chelsea, half of these incidents concerned religion, a further four were to do with race, and there was also an accusation of abuse related to sexual orientation.</p>

      <p>Leeds supporters faced eight accusations of racist abuse, and their remaining two incidents concerned sexual orientation. </p>
      <p>Abuse concerning sexual orientation was the biggest concern for Leicester, who faced no less than five allegations of such abuse - more than any of the sides involved in the report. The Foxes also had three allegations of racism and two incidents of abuse relating to religion.</p>
      <p>Anti-discrimination organisation Kick It Out have worked tirelessly to aid the battle against all forms of hate crime, while the <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a> also recently unveiled their 'No Room for Racism' campaign.</p>
