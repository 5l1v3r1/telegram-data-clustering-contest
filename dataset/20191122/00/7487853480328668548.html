      <h1>Twitter's Heartstrings Pulled as Mauricio Pochettino Writes Goodbye Message to Spurs Players</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/14928490" target="_blank">Ross Kennerley</a></address>
      <p>​Football is a cruel industry; in more ways than one.</p>
      <p>We laugh, we cheer, we cry, we sulk, we complain. </p>
      <p>Emotions run high almost every week, but sometimes it is matters off the pitch that can have the most profound effect.</p>
      <p>When Mauricio Pochettino was relieved of his <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/tottenham">​Tottenham</a> duties, along with all his staff, on Tuesday evening, it is fair to say few saw it coming. Well, at least not at that time and in the manner it did, anyway.</p>

      <p>Arguably one of football's 'nice guys', the always smiling, cheerful demeanour he exuded was one that brought warmth and joy to Spurs fans. Something that was made clear when the outpouring of disappointment at the announcement came about despite the club having a mostly miserable 2019 league campaign.</p>
      <p>His replacement Jose Mourinho was brought in with remarkable efficiency (within 12 hours), as the footballing world turned their attentions towards what is next in store for the <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a> side, as opposed to what has been.</p>
      <p>That's until Pochettino's right-hand man Jesus Perez decided to yank everyone's hearts out of their chests, stamp on them repeatedly and then present them back to us with a tear in his eye.</p>
      <p>He couldn't do that? Could he? And especially not <i>with accompanying images</i>?</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Oh yes, he could.</p>
      <p>The assistant coach posted a photo of the Pochettino, still in full Spurs gear, essentially signing off from north London with a message that read: "Big thanks to you all! We can't say goodbye... you will always be in our hearts."</p>
      <p>Stop it. Just. Stop it.</p>
      <p>The fact that Pochettino was still in his Tottenham attire suggests it was mere moments after the news was broken to him and his staff, while the vast majority of his players were away on international duty.</p>

      <p>​​While Pochettino's five-year spell with the Premier League side yielded no trophies, endless goodwill messages emphasised the fine work he had done to turn the club into a formidable top-flight force.</p>

      <p>​​The tears were flowing, the memes were popping off left, right and centre, and Twitter simply couldn't keep its emotions in check.</p>

      <p>​​While the 47-year-old and his staff's sacking has divided opinion, certain people have questioned the board for their involvement.</p>
      <p>Having gone 18 months without signing any players during his reign, Daniel Levy's name cropped up under the list of reasons why his decision was an unjust one.</p>

      <p>​​Some fans of the <i>other </i>north London team poked their heads up from behind their similarly dreadful season to have a say in matters.</p>
      <p>Talk about desperation. Or perhaps, it is just because Unai Emery isn't that good?</p>

      <p>​​While the less cynical, black-hearted and cold of us gazed at Perez' tweet with sadness and eyes slowly watering, there were, ermm, others who didn't quite think the same.</p>
      <p>Not at all, in fact.</p>
