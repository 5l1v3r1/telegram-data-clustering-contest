        <b>A Redmi Note 7S owner has reported a fault with his device that he believes caused it to explode. The user claimed that the smartphone was treated in a normal manner and wasn’t even charging when it caught on fire. However, after a thorough examination of the melted handset, Xiaomi has concluded it was caused by “customer induced damage”.</b>

      <p>There have been plenty of reports over the years of a variety of smartphones bursting into flames, with some being <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Images-of-exploded-Samsung-Galaxy-S10-5G-evoke-memories-of-Note-7-debacle.419806.0.html">attributed</a> to individual users and others being <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-7-investigation-results-are-now-public.193102.0.html">caused</a> by faulty parts. The latest in a long line of explosive episodes involved a Xiaomi Redmi Note 7S. The <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-7S.424059.0.html">Redmi Note 7S</a> is the Indian market version of the versatile <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-7-Smartphone-Review.414550.0.html">Redmi Note 7</a>, which features a <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Qualcomm-Snapdragon-660-SoC-Benchmarks-and-Specs.299438.0.html">Qualcomm Snapdragon 660</a> SoC and a 4,000 mAh battery with fast-charging capability.</p>
      <p>The Redmi Note 7S user in this case, Ishwar Chavhan from Mumbai, India, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/xiaomi-smartphone-catches-fire-company-claims-customer-induced-damage/articleshow/72152915.cms">stated</a> that he had only recently bought the device and had used it without issue. However, the smartphone caught on fire while on a workplace table, and it can be seen in the photos (see below) just how much catastrophic damage was caused by the unexpected meltdown.</p>
      <p>Chavhan believes there was a manufacturing issue, and he claims he was informed by Xiaomi representatives that it was a faulty battery that caused his Redmi Note 7S to catch on fire. The Chinese manufacturer later issued the following <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/xiaomi-smartphone-catches-fire-company-claims-customer-induced-damage/articleshow/72152915.cms">statement</a> when asked about the incident:</p>
      <blockquote>At Xiaomi, quality of our products is of utmost importance. The trust that Mi Fans have shown in the brand for the past 5 years is a testament to that. We also take pride in having one of the strongest after-sales networks in the country with an aim to solve customer issues seamlessly. In this particular case, after careful examination, it was concluded that the damage was caused due to external force, and thus, classified under ‘customer induced damage.’</blockquote>
      <p>What the “external force” was that caused the Redmi Note 7S to catch fire hasn’t yet been mentioned, but looking at the results of the fire suggests it would have had to be something both extreme and obviously noticeable. Chavhan has said he was neither charging the phone at the time nor had dropped it, so the cause appears to be a mystery for the time being.</p>
