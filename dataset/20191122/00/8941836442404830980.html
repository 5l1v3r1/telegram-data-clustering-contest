      <h1>No. 16 Auburn hosts FCS Samford between rivalry game</h1>

      <p>AUBURN, Ala. (AP) - The Auburn Tigers have had no choice but to revise their goals for this season.</p>
      <p>Competitive losses to three Top 10 teams have knocked the 16th-ranked Tigers (7-3) from even longshot playoff and Southeastern Conference contention. They host in-state FCS team Samford (5-6) Saturday with a new goal firmly in place.</p>
      <p>“Our goal now is to win 10 games, which is extremely hard to do with the schedule like we have,” Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said.</p>
      <p>Auburn finally snapped out of an offensive funk in the fourth quarter against No. 4 Georgia, but fell 21-14. Meeting that 10-win goal would require not only beating Samford, a private school in suburban Birmingham, but No. 5 Alabama and a bowl opponent to be named later.</p>
      <p>The next step toward that 10-win goal should be the easiest one</p>

      <p>But Auburn is still trying to get into gear offensively. Georgia and the SEC’s top defense held the Tigers scoreless through three quarters.</p>
      <p>The Tigers’ defense hasn’t been the issue.</p>
      <p>“This is the best defense I’ve ever faced in my entire life,” said Samford coach Chris Hatcher, wrapping up his 20th season as a college head coach. “They are a really top-echelon of college football, football team, especially on the defensive side.”</p>
      <p>It’s the season finale for Samford, which has played a total of eight overtime periods, going 1-3 in games that went into OT.</p>

        <p>Some other things to know about Auburn’s matchup against Samford:</p>
        <p>BACKUP QB</p>
        <p>This game should supply Auburn with its best chance to get new backup quarterback Cord Sandberg some experience. Sandberg moved up to the No. 2 spot behind Bo Nix with the late-October departure of Joey Gatewood, who plans to transfer. The former minor league baseball player hasn’t attempted a pass this season and has one rush for 4 yards.</p>
        <p>SAMFORD VS. SEC</p>
        <p>The Bulldogs are 2-77-3 all-time against current members of the Southeastern Conference, going 0-27-1 against Auburn. The Tigers have shut out Samford 18 times among those 28 meetings. The Bulldogs haven’t been shut out in their last 213 games.</p>
        <p>BURNS &amp; SAMFORD</p>
        <p>Auburn co-offensive coordinator and receivers coach Kodi Burns got his first full-time coaching position at Samford. He coached the Bulldogs’ running backs in 2014 under former Auburn Heisman Trophy winner Pat Sullivan.</p>
        <p>AU RUNNING GAME</p>
        <p>JaTarvious Whitlow, D.J. Williams and Auburn’s other running backs want to get going again. Nix was Auburn’s leading rusher against Georgia. Whitlow, returning from a knee injury, gained 23 yards on 11 carries and Williams wasn’t much more effective (eight rushes, 26 yards).</p>
        <p>DUAL-THREAT QB</p>
        <p>Samford quarterback Chris Oladokun is a threat as both a passer and a runner. He has passed for 2,064 yards and 18 touchdowns. Oladokun is also the team’s No. 2 rusher with 488 yards and eight TDs.</p>
