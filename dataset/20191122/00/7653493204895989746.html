      <h1>Electric Merc SUV Makes US Debut: Daimler CEO Calls For Incentives</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/computer-daily-news/" target="_blank">Computer Daily News</a></address>
      <p>Daimler will begin selling its electric Mercedes-Benz EQC SUV in the US early next year at a starting price of US$67,900 (A$99,618).</p>
      <p>The EQC 400 4MATIC can charge its batteries on the move and recharge from 10% to 80% in 40 minutes.</p>
      <p>Daimler CEO Ola Kaellenius used this weekâ€™s announcement to call for more incentives to develop electric and hybrid vehicles.</p>
      <p>Sales of new-energy vehicles, or NEVs, fell 45.6% in October on year, following a 33% decline in September after the Chinese government withdrew incentives to buy NEVs. Daimler believes the EQC and other electric cars will account for 15-25% of its sales by 2025.</p>
