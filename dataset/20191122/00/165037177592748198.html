        <b>Barcelona striker Luis Suarez has spent six seasons at Camp Nou but has admitted the thought of playing in America is a "nice possibility".</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/l-suarez-29685/">Luis Suarez </a>is "very happy" at<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona"> Barcelona </a>but admits he is <b>open to the possibility of joining a Major League Soccer club.</b></p>
      <p>The Uruguay international is in<b> his sixth season at Camp Nou </b>and has another full campaign left to run on his current deal.</p>
      <p>Suarez, who<b> turns 33 in January, </b>has been touted as a possible target for <b>David Beckham's Inter Miami franchise</b> ahead of their MLS debut next year.</p>
      <p>Several established stars have made the switch Stateside in recent years, including the likes of<b> Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Wayne Rooney</b>, while talented youngsters have been lured from South America.</p>
      <p><b>"MLS is a competition which has grown a lot in the last few years</b> and you can see that with the young players that have moved there in the last two years, above all the South Americans," Suarez told ESPN FC.</p>

      <p>"That shows that <b>the league wants to grow and not just bring in players of a certain age</b> that are going to retire there. They look for that mix to make the league better."</p>
      <p>Seattle Sounders midfielder Nicolas Lodeiro said earlier this month that international team-mate Suarez has <b>discussed the possibility of joining him in MLS.</b></p>
      <p>The<b> former Liverpool striker</b> confirmed those talks took place and is <b>not ruling out a move further down the line</b>, describing the thought of playing in America as <b>a "nice possibility".</b></p>
      <p>"I didn't commit to anything [with Lodeiro]," Suarez said. "I had a conversation with him. MLS is a league that any player would be interested in and I asked him about the competition and about his team-mates.</p>
      <p>"I have a contract with Barca and<b> I am very happy here</b>. In the future you never know,<b> it's an attractive league".</b></p>
      <p>"Given that I have been lucky to have had success at the top level for a long time, <b>what I would look out for next is stability for my family </b>and the well-being of my children".</p>
      <p>"They would all make the decision along with me and<b> the United States is a nice possibility."</b></p>
