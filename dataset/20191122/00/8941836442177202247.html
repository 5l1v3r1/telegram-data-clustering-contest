      <p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-mexico-game-commission/">New Mexico Game Commission</a> has voted to reconsider a rule governing access to streams and rivers adjacent to private property.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-mexico-game-commission/">commission</a> voted 6-1 Thursday to order the Game and Fish Department to come up with a plan to either amend or repeal the measure.</p>
      <p>The rule was adopted by the previous commission two years ago. It allows landowners to petition the department to certify waters on private property as “non-navigable” and prohibit public access without written permission.</p>
      <p>The department has approved five applications certifying waters as “non-navigable.” A few others are pending.</p>

        <p>State Attorney General Hector Balderas says his office will work with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-mexico-game-commission/">commission</a> in the coming months to ensure the rule balances landowner interests in protecting their property from trespass and damage while ensuring New Mexicans’ rights of access to public waterways.</p>
