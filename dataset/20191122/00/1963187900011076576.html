      <p>Cairo_22 November 2019: Egypt faces Ivory Coast on Friday night at Cairo International Stadium at 2019 Africa U_23 Cup of Nations Final. <br/><br/>Both teams secured a ticket to 2020 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo and they aim to complete the successful mission by achieving the title for the first time in the history. <br/><br/>A new champion will be crowned tonight as Gabon and Nigeria, who failed to advance from the group stage in this edition, won the first two titles. <br/><br/>"We are happy with what we have done till now and now we play for the title. It’s true our target was the Olympics ticket but that doesn’t mean we will take things lightly against Cote d’Ivoire." Egypt captain Ramadan Sobhy said on Thursday during the pre-final press conference. <br/><br/>Egyptian fans count on Sobhy to secure the title as the winger played a massive role in Egypt’s achievement as he produced a wonderful performance at the semi-finals against South Africa which ended with a 3-0 victory for the pharaohs with Sobhy opening the score from the penalty spot.</p>
