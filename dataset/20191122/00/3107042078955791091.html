      <p>A Dunedin doctor accused of the murder of a teenage girl told police he never visited her house on the night of her death.</p>
      <p>Venod Skantha (32) is accused of fatally stabbing 16-year-old Amber-Rose Rush in the bedroom of her Corstorphine home in Dunedin on February 2 last year. He denies the charge.</p>
      <p>The jury today have been played an interview Skantha had with police.</p>
      <p>In the interview Skantha said the police's theory - that he did it to stop 16-year-old Amber-Rose making allegations that may destroy his medical career - was far-fetched.</p>
      <p>"Why would I risk my career and everything for that. It doesn't make sense. It's not worth it,"  the defendant said.</p>
      <p>"It's the most ridiculous thing. Why would I do that? Don't you think that's a very extreme thing for someone to do?"</p>
      <p>Skantha is on trial before the High Court at Dunedin over Amber-Rose's violent death in her Corstorphine home on the night of February 2.</p>
      <p>He was arrested two days later after police pulled his ex-girlfriend over in central Dunedin.</p>
      <p>"Am I under arrest?" Skantha asked Detective Constable Wayne O'Connell.</p>
      <p>He was told he was not and offered to make a statement on video.</p>
      <p>The 48-minute interview was the first time the 10 men and two women of the jury had heard from the defendant during the three weeks of the trial's duration.</p>
      <p>Skantha called Amber-Rose "just sort of a friend"</p>
      <p>"I was never really close to Amber at all," he said. "She's much younger than me."</p>
      <p>Skantha acknowledged the victim had recently aired accusations about an indecent assault he supposedly committed a month earlier.</p>
      <p>He told Det Const O'Connell that he was "definitely not a creep".</p>
      <p>"She accused me of inappropriately touching her and I genuinely have no recollection of that. I think I was very drunk at the time," the defendant said.</p>
      <p>"If you want to say rubbish about me, I just don't really care," he said of the allegations.</p>
      <p>When asked of his movements on the night of Amber-Rose's death, Skantha said he picked up his teenage friend who then drove back to his Fairfield home, then on to Balclutha.</p>
      <p>Later in the interview, the defendant added that the driver had taken him along a beach road and they had pulled up at a secluded car park.</p>
      <p>Det Const O'Connell asked if it could have been Blackhead Quarry.</p>
      <p>"Ok, that makes sense," Skantha said. "He just wanted to show me a nice spot."</p>
      <p>Amber-Rose's phone was later found discarded in the swampy area.</p>
      <p>The officer suggested Skantha was not being honest.</p>
      <p>"I have reason to believe you're responsible for Amber's death," he said.</p>
      <p>"Don't say that to me. It's not in my nature. I promise you. I don't know where you're getting this from," the defendant responded.</p>
      <p>Skantha said he would not know how to get into the victim's home even if he wanted to.</p>
      <p>When it was suggested his teenage friend had shown him where the key was – under an ornamental Buddha statue - he put the focus on the boy.</p>
      <p>"If he knows that much, maybe he did it," Skantha said.</p>
      <p>As Det Const O'Connell's interview reached its climax, the defendant asked whether he could leave.</p>
      <p>"Not at the moment," the officer said before reading him his rights and placing him under arrest.</p>
      <p>Skantha expressed his shock and asked to his ex-partner Brigid Clinton, who was being interviewed at the same time.</p>
      <p>When Det Const O'Connell left the room, the defendant followed and continued his requests.</p>
      <p>Crown evidence will conclude today, then the defence will consider whether they will call witnesses.</p>
      <p>A verdict is expected next week. </p>
