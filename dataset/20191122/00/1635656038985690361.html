      <p>Thankfully, there are ways to get your fix of festive fabrication without deconstructing half the house for the sake of hardwood flooring.</p>
      <p>From multi-tools to making sets to modular music machines, all of this creative kit is sure to keep tinkerers and bodgers busy during the holidays – and hopefully away from the power tools.</p>

      <h4>Dremel Lite (£74)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.stuff.tv/sites/stuff.tv/files/styles/main-full-width-mobile-retina/public/brands/Gift-guides/2019/DIY/stuff_christmas_gift_guide_2019_dremel.png?itok=NtOo3uW4&amp;timestamp=1573565126"/>

      <p>Certain festive tasks can only be tackled by human hands. Stringing the tinsel, for example, or basting the turkey. For jobs that would benefit from motorised input, though, a Dremel is indispensable – and the latest version of the miraculous multi-tool is handier than ever. Compact, lightweight and as adaptable as an elf, charge the lithe little Lite via USB and you’ll have a nifty spinner ready for any December DIY.</p>
      <p>Polishing your vintage cutlery for Christmas lunch? Dremel. Sanding a rough edge off the nativity scene? Dremel. Picking a present to please the in-laws? That one’s on you.</p>

      <h4>Sugru Original 8-pack (£10)</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>Tempers aren’t the only thing that can fray on Christmas Day – and there’s nothing worse than dusting off the slow cooker, only to find its wire is worryingly worn. Thankfully, there’s a simple solution: mould this malleable putty around the cable and, after 24 hours, it’ll set into a silicone rubber shell.</p>
      <p>Alas, while it can fix, bond and seal all sorts of stuff, even the sticky power of Sugru can’t repair your strained relationships.</p>

      <h4>DeWalt DCR011-XJ (£100)</h4>

      <p>What’s the most important tool on a job? A drill? A driver? An angle grinder? Wrong, wrong and wrong: it’s a speaker. Sure, it can’t make holes in a wall, but without sweet beats to entertain the site crew, construction will soon grind to a halt. Bring bass to the build with DeWalt’s durable Bluetooth boomer.</p>
      <p>Rugged, punchy and styled like a power tool, simply stick a spare battery pack in the back and it’ll hammer out the wireless tunes. Or use the one from your drill, if you prefer throwing shapes to making them.</p>

      <h4>Leatherman Free T4 (£75)</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>As any seasoned DIY fan knows, the need to fix can come at any time. Keep Leatherman’s Free T4 to hand for true utility wherever you travel: from tightening loose screws to untying new shoes, its array of compact tools can tackle most daily tasks – and a few unusual ones, too.</p>
      <p>Besides a knife and four drivers, the pocketable accomplice packs bottle- and package-openers, tweezers, a file, a prying tool and an awl, in case the need to prove your leatherworking prowess unexpectedly arises.</p>

      <p>Cardboard is a truly versatile construction material and rarely is it found in such abundance as on the floor at Christmas. Don’t sacrifice creative potential in the name of cleanliness: harness its flat-packed adaptability with this nifty tool kit.</p>
      <p>Comprised of 28 reusable plastic screws in two sizes, a driver and a compact saw that’s safe for small hands, there’s everything you need to transform packaging into play time. When then den has had its day, simply remove the screws, recycle the boards and wait for the next unboxing.</p>

      <h4>TechWillSaveUs Music Studio Pack (£80)</h4>

      <p>Music might be a gift, but every maestro must start somewhere and enduring off-key chords is not the easiest way to spend Christmas Day. Delay the inevitable with this self-assembly kit.</p>
      <p>Also available as three separate sets, the synth, guitar and remixer all come flat-packed, so your junior Dr Dre will need to craft before they can play. Once they’re up and strumming, each instrument encourages your sprog rocker to think about sound waves, components and how they work in harmony – even if the resulting noise means you can’t think at all.</p>

      <h4>XYZPrinting da Vinci Nano (€259)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.stuff.tv/sites/stuff.tv/files/styles/main-full-width-mobile-retina/public/brands/Gift-guides/2019/DIY/stuff_christmas_gift_guide_2019_davincinano.png?itok=LmJrCbMC&amp;timestamp=1573565393"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Marzipan might just be the ultimate creative tool for Yuletide makers. Oh, sure, this desktop 3D printer can fabricate any dinky designs you wirelessly fire at it from the XYZmaker app, but can it create sweet tiny treats styled like your favourite seasonal fruit? No, it can’t.</p>
      <p>Still, with a printing speed of 70mm per second and a compact form factor that’s perfect for takeaway making, it’s not a bad backup to your artisanal almond moulding. And, while you can’t munch on what the Nano W forges, at least its filament is biocompostable.</p>

      <h4>Korg Volca Modular (£179)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.stuff.tv/sites/stuff.tv/files/styles/main-full-width-mobile-retina/public/brands/Gift-guides/2019/DIY/stuff_christmas_gift_guide_2019_korgvolca.png?itok=ooE1YgFw&amp;timestamp=1573565427"/>
      </figure>
      <p>You can’t nail them to the wall, but sounds are just as much a medium for making as bricks and mortar. Think synthesising new noises needs a bank-breaking array of knobs and switches? Not if you’ve got a Volca: analogue and semi-modular, this micro synth packs pro potential without the price tag.</p>
      <p>From 50 colour-coded patch points across eight modules to a 16-step sequencer for real-time beats, stick its twenty pin cables where you fancy and get twiddling. Who knows, there could be a West Coast Christmas hit within you.</p>
