      <p>Have you ever been told that “you have so <i>much </i>potential”? Or, indeed, have you ever said that to someone else? In society today, there seems to be a general notion floating around that people possess something called “potential”. The basic idea is that, if you work hard and apply yourself diligently, then you’ll fulfil your “potential”.</p>
      <p>It is perhaps not surprising that statements about “potential” seem to be mostly used in a “motivational” sense. Generally, it appears to be the case that the topic of potential gets raised by someone like a teacher, coach, or parent when one of their students or children are not acting in the way the teacher, coach, or parent would like them to act. Advising someone about their potential is meant to spur them on to greater efforts and the attainment of loftier heights.</p>

      <p>So, what is potential? Do some of us have it and others don’t? Or do we just have it in different quantities? Do some people have a lot of potential whereas others only have a small amount? How is potential determined? Who decides how much potential someone has and in what area? If you ever reach your potential, what then?</p>
      <p>Did Usain Bolt reach his potential? Has Meryl Streep reached hers? Will Serena Williams need to win another one or two more Grand Slam titles before she reaches her potential, or is she already there?</p>
      <p>Looking at definitions can be fun and instructive. Here are some definitions of “potential” from dictionary.com that are relevant:</p>
      <p>1. Possible as opposed to actual;</p>
      <p>2. Capable of being or becoming;</p>
      <p>3. Possibility; and</p>
      <p>4. A latent excellence or ability that may or may not be developed.</p>
      <p>It seems apparent from these definitions that each and everyone of us could be considered to have a great deal of potential (is that many “potentials”?) in a vast number of areas. We are all born with many similar features but also different abilities, proclivities, and preferences. Even from the very beginning we like different amounts of light or noise or cuddling. Perhaps even more important than the tendencies and talents we arrive with are the environments we are born into that afford us greater or fewer opportunities to express and develop the skills and propensities we have.</p>
      <p>But even if it was possible to predict the future, and determine the amount of potential someone has, and the area in which their potential is greatest, does that mean they have some special and important responsibility to develop <i>that </i>potential in <i>that </i>area?</p>
      <p>Actually, the history books are littered with child proteges who didn’t go on to bigger and better things as adults and, conversely, adults who were less than remarkable as children but who, later, made stellar contributions to humanity. Einstein might be the poster boy here.</p>
      <p>Today, you are the realisation of yesterday’s potential you. There never has been, never will be, and never <i>could </i>be, any predetermined masterplan of what you <i>should </i>become. You <i>are </i>as you should be. You are “right” just the way you are. Often, it seems very easy to get caught up in pursuing a quest of what we could possibly become, rather than appreciating who and what we are now. Lots of messages in society urge people to become better than they currently are. Ultimately, however, we are human <i>beings </i>not human <i>becomings</i>. All we have, and all we’ll ever have, is what we have right now, at every now.</p>
      <p>The brilliant educationalist, Sir Ken Robinson, urges people to move away from the idea that preschool is preparing students for primary school, and primary school is preparing students for secondary school, and secondary school is preparing students for university. Each schooling experience is of value and needs to be appreciated in its own right, for what it is, not what it might lead to.</p>
      <p>That’s not to say that people shouldn’t continue to learn and seek new horizons if they want to. People should do whatever they want to do. And they should do whatever they want to do in a way that doesn’t stop others from doing likewise. If what someone wants to do prevents others from doing what they want to do, then restrictions in some form or another will be applied before too long. With that very general caveat in mind, people will travel their own path, whatever that path might be.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the greatest potential to be realised, the most amazing potential as opposed to actual, the most incredible ability that is yet to be developed, is for individuals to achieve robust and enduring contentment and wellbeing. That will come about when people find ways of grabbing their own stars and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/dreaming">dreaming</a> their own dreams.</p>
      <p>Contentment is nothing more mysterious than keeping your world the way you want it to be. Those ten innocuous little words, “<i>keeping your world the way you want it to be</i>”, can be devilishly difficult to personify on a daily basis. Ironically, the state that these ten words describe can’t be achieved in some far-off dreamy land of realised potentials. Contentment is only ever right here and right now. So, what’s the state of <i>your </i>world <i>right now</i>? As the architect and choir master of that world, what will your very-next-right-now move be?</p>

      <p>I don't think that that is true, at least, not in the strictest possible sense. There are lots of things that people do that do not prevent others from pursuing happiness, or even inconvenience them, that are still ill advised most of the time that people do them, like buying lottery tickets for example. To be more technical, just telling people to pursue their desires makes sense from a hedonic perspective of happiness. But people who talk about "reaching your potential." are usually assuming an eudaimonic perspective of happiness. So your position isn't really going to persuade most people who really believe that we need to "realize our potential." That being said, I do agree that enjoining others to "realize your potential." is not well advised either. for two reasons: 1. Everyone has infinite potentials for good as well as evil that they could hypothetically actualize. So its just two broad a target. 2. Like you said, no one ever actually does it. Who is to say that Paul Erdos couldn't have published one more paper? Or that Babe Ruth couldn't have hit one more homerun? Or that Mozart couldn't have penned one more opera? So its just asking too much.</p>

      <p>Hi Gregory,<br/>Thanks for taking the time to comment. I was interested in some of your points but, ultimately, I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree. I don't think I have "over-stated" my case and I think the passage you have quoted is true even in the strictest possible sense (although I'm not entirely sure what that is).<br/>Perhaps it all boils down to a different understanding of what a "desire" is and how it works. Maybe it's something else entirely.<br/>I should also clarify, I'm not bothered at all if my position doesn't persuade anyone. I use this blog to put forward a particular perspective on different topics. What other people do with that perspective is entirely up to them. Along the way, if some people like the ideas and want to communicate more about them, that's great. If no-one does, that's great too.<br/>Warm regards,<br/>Tim</p>
