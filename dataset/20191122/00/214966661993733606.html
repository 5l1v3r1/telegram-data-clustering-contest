      <p>Young gun Jack Lukosius has become the 21st player to re-sign with the Gold Coast Suns, extending his stay for a further two seasons.</p>
      <p>The No.2 draft pick will stay with the club until at least the end of the 2022 season, following a breakout debut season that included 21 games.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old said he had loved his first twelve months with the club and jumped at the chance to extend his playing career with the Suns.</p>
      <p>“Over the off-season I took the opportunity to reflect on my first year at AFL level and that made making the decision an easy one, I’ve loved my time at the club so far,” Lukosius said.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a great group of players, who are all committing to the future of this football club and I can’t wait to be a part of it.</p>
      <p>“The way everyone at the club has made my family and I feel welcome has definitely helped with the transition to becoming a professional footballer in the AFL.</p>
      <p>“The challenge now is to put my head down, continue to work hard on developing my game and ensure I’m ready to play my role for the team on field in 2020.”</p>
      <p>Chief Executive Mark Evans said he was thrilled that the hard work staff and players were putting into creating the best possible environment for players to succeed was beginning to take shape.</p>
      <p>“Having Jack Lukosius extend his contract with the club, amongst a host of the club’s core group of players, highlights the work put into the reshaping the football program,” Evans said.</p>
      <p>“It’s fantastic to see our playing group, coaches and staff all buying into our vision for the football club and investing their time into helping us succeed.</p>
      <p>“Jack’s signature has generated excitement amongst our players and staff, but to witness the reaction of our Foundation Members, who heard the news first at our annual Foundation Members event earlier this evening demonstrates the passion and commitment that many Coasters have for the SUNS.”</p>
      <p>“It’s an exciting time to be involved with the SUNS and the next phase of our journey is going to be an exciting one and today Jack joins Ben King and Izak Rankine in extending their contracts, while next week we will head to the draft with selections one and two.”</p>
      <p>In the past 12 months the club has extended deals for the majority of its core playing group, including David Swallow, Jarrod Witts, Touk Miller, Rory Thompson, Alex Sexton, Peter Wright, Jack Bowes, Ben Ainsworth, Izak Rankine, Sam Day, Caleb Graham, Will Brodie, Darcy Macpherson, Jez McLennan, Ben King, Nick Holman, Sam Fletcher, Jacob Heron, Jacob Dawson and Mitch Riordan.</p>
