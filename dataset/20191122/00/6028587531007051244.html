      <p>The Taylor Swift/Scooter Braun drama shows no signs of cooling yet, as the entertainment mogul addressed the singer through a lengthy <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5KRVxYn4E3/">Instagram statement</a> on Friday morning. Braun claimed that since Swift posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1195123215657508867">Twitter statement</a> last week alleging that he and her former label, Big Machine Records, would not let her perform her old hits at the American Music Awards this Sunday, he has received “numerous death threats directed at my family.” Braun has largely neglected to comment publicly on the feud, though he changed his tone after his “wife received a phone call threatening the safety of our children.” (Read <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/11/22/scooter-braun-says-hes-getting-death-threats-over-taylor-swift-feud/"><i>Forbes</i></a>’ report for a more thorough breakdown.)“I assume this was not your intention but it is important that you understand that your words carry a tremendous amount of weight and that your message can be interpreted by some in different ways,” Braun continued. “While I am frustrated with your accusations and respectfully disagree with many of your statements, it is important that I am clear—no artist should ever feel cornered or bullied.” He ended his message with a screenshot of an apparent DM he received that reads, “Hi, why dont you just die withyour children??? I will buy a gun tmr and them shoot you allin the head [sic].”</p>
      <p>The “message” to which Braun is likely referring comes near the end of Swift’s original Twitter statement. “Please let Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun know how you feel about this,” she implored her fans. “Scooter also manages several artists who I really believe care about other artists and their work. Please ask them for help with this—I’m hoping that maybe they can talk some sense into the men who are exercising tyrannical control over someone who just wants to play the music she wrote.”</p>
      <p>It’s important to note that Swift, Braun and Big Machine have all essentially denied wrongdoing in this scuffle, framing themselves as victims who are willing to cooperate to squash their beef for the greater good of artists and fans. All parties have also claimed to have their requests for an amicable, in-person meeting denied, making it difficult to ascertain what interactions really took place privately. (Representatives for Swift, Braun and Big Machine did not immediately respond to requests for comment.) But Swift’s initial post is not unprecedented; at the height of her public feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian regarding West’s 2016 song “Famous,” the singer issued a <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/sarahburton/taylor-swifts-i-would-very-much-like-to-be-excluded-from-thi">statement</a> on Instagram, writing, “Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one I never asked to be a part of, since 2009.”</p>
      <p>Swift is an effective communicator who chooses her words carefully and economically. In both statements, she effectively dodges accountability and puts the blame—and onus for reconciliation—on the opposing party. Whether she is in the right here is not my call to make. But in her initial post to Braun, Swift has tapped into a dangerously powerful resource: the passionate, occasionally toxic, devotion of her fans.</p>
      <p>There are plenty of recent examples of toxic fandom, colloquially referred to as “<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stan">stan</a> culture.” In 2018, Nicki Minaj responded to a mildly critical tweet from professed fan and culture writer Wanna Thompson, emboldening her fans to follow suit and harass Thompson for weeks following the incident. I <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2018/07/25/nicki-minaj-queen-album-rollout/#108b64ea2ddb">covered</a> the spat and received dozens of my own death threats across Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Celebrities with massive social media followings can easily weaponize their fans against their critics or rivals, implicitly or explicitly. And because social media is hardly a place for nuance, civil discourse can quickly fly out the window. </p>
      <p>Nothing about Swift’s statement is explicitly hostile or threatening. She does not “sic” her fans on Braun or Borchetta, and I will assume she never intended for these men to receive death threats from her fans. But at a certain point, intent no longer matters. Ultimately, Swift asked her fans to help her achieve a result, and they set out to do so by any means necessary. It goes without saying that death threats and harassment were neither necessary nor productive methods.</p>
      <p>Let me be clear: I do not believe Swift had malicious intent when she shared her Twitter statement, nor do I believe her fans at large are callous monsters who would threaten the safety of strangers. This behavior is reflective of a small subset of fans that gives their respective fandoms a bad reputation. Yet as one of the biggest celebrities in the world, Swift should understand the complexities and undesirable outcomes of social media interactions, as well as the dangers of toxic fan culture. She is not to blame for the small percentage of her fans who consider death threats and harassment to be healthy methods of communication, nor does she owe Braun anything in this war of words.</p>
      <p>Still, Swift wields a tremendous amount of power, and when she speaks, her fans listen. If Braun and his family have truly received a myriad of death threats and harassment over the past week, perhaps it would behoove Swift to issue another statement encouraging her overzealous fans to back off. After all, she has technically won this battle, as she is free to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/11/18/big-machine-records-will-let-taylor-swift-perform-her-old-songs-at-the-american-music-awards/#57b31e603d38">perform her old hits</a> on the AMAs this Sunday. Swift sought help from her fans to reach a resolution with Braun under the guise of being the bigger person. How will that serve her now that she has the upper hand?</p>
