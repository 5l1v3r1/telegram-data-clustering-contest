      <h1>The 20 Most Anticipated Hotel Openings Of 2020</h1>

      <p>We all make New Year’s resolutions. The luxury hotel industry is no different. But rather than center its goals around diet changes or finding love, the sector has seemingly joined forces to accomplish one thing in 2020—to show you, the well-traveled guest, that when it comes to having memorable overnight experiences, the best is yet to come. Whether you’re seeking staggering structures in the heart of a big city or intimate wine country escapes, the coming year will spawn an impressive roster of real estate. Of course, with all the tidying up you’ve resolved to do in your life, you don’t have the time to look into every resort on the cusp of opening its doors. Luckily, <a href="https://www.forbestravelguide.com/#cmpid=forbes_HL">Forbes Travel Guide</a>’s editors have donned the hard hats, looked over the renderings and constructed this list of 20 hot spots you’ll be hearing the most about in 2020.</p>

      <p>Situated on the same riverbanks as Capella Bangkok (and having the same owner), this 299-room wonder is generating its own wave of excitement prior to its early-2020 unveiling. One look at the stunning indoor-outdoor public spaces, seven dining and drinking outlets and riverfront infinity pool, and you begin to see why.</p>

Needless to say, with its twisting tower design, contemporary stylings and enviable location between the High Line and Hudson River, the first Six Senses in North America will have little trouble getting attention when it opens in 2020.</p>

Beyond 149 Martin Brudnizki Design Studio-conceived units, the property will offer 40 Pendry residences, a rooftop pool, a live entertainment venue, a bowling alley and more.</p>

      <p>Richard Branson spends a lot of his time trying to figure out how to get people into other orbits, but endeavors like this amenity-filled wonder assure us that his feet are still firmly planted here on Earth. Once Hard Rock Hotel and Casino closes in February, the space will be re-envisioned with 1,500-plus rooms, 60,000 square feet of gaming and a five-acre pool area.</p>

      <p>With 193 rooms and suites soaring into the clouds (the hotel takes up the top six floors of a 39-story structure), five regal restaurants and bars and a top-floor spa worthy of a queen, Tokyo’s second Four Seasons (its first, in Marunouchi, feels more like a boutique property) seems well-suited to face the Imperial Palace.</p>
