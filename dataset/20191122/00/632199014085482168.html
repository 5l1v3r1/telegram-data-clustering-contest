      <h3>Review</h3>
      <p>Renault raised the bar with the <a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/cars/reviews/first-drive-renault-clio">launch of the new Clio back in August,</a> so we were looking forward to seeing if it could win us over a second time with its all-new Captur.</p>
      <p>Like the Clio, the new Captur is based on the Renault-Nissan Alliance’s latest CMF-B platform, which also underpins the <a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/cars/reviews/nissan-juke-first-drive-review">new Nissan Juke we tested last month</a>.</p>
      <p>The platform majors on refinement and enables the latest driver assistance technology and electrified powertrains to be slotted into the Captur.</p>
      <p>From launch, the car will be offered with petrol and diesel engines, but a new plug-in hybrid will join the line-up next year.</p>

      <p>The restyled body looks sleeker, reinforcing Renault’s intentions to move closer to the premium market. Front and rear LED running lights give a distinctive appearance to the compact SUV.</p>
      <p>It’s inside where the Captur really sets itself apart from the first-generation model, though. There is a significant uplift in material quality, with the smart new dash lifted from the latest Clio.</p>
      <p>Passenger space has been increased and comfort levels elevated, making long journeys a breeze for all on board.</p>
      <p>The boot is also now bigger than before at 422 litres. Only eight litres (the size of a small dog) differentiates it from a Nissan Qashqai.</p>
      <p>Even more boot space is available if you deploy the Captur’s sliding rear seat, freeing up an additional 100 litres – although you’ll have no room for rear seat passengers in this instance.</p>

      <p>We were impressed by how quiet the Captur is at motorway speeds. Its refinement levels are among the best in class. Even on 18-inch wheels the Captur manages to iron out all but the biggest of bumps. We expect the standard-fit 17-inch rims will offer even greater compliance when the car arrives in the UK.</p>
      <p>The engine line-up consists of a 0.9-litre turbo petrol with 100PS, a 1.3-litre with 130PS or 155PS and a 1.5-litre diesel offering 95PS or 115PS. Renault expects the 100PS to be the most popular.</p>
      <p>We managed more than 40mpg in the 130PS car (the official figure is 44mpg), which comes with a six-speed manual gearbox. The range-topping 155PS model is only available with a seven-speed auto, which is a little hesitant when pulling away.</p>
      <p>All models have low CO2 emissions, ranging from 106g/km for the least powerful oil burner to 127g/km for the most potent petrol.</p>
      <p>Prices start at £17,500 and even the entry-level Play model comes with a seven-inch touchscreen, lane-keep assist and LED headlights.</p>
      <p>The Iconic (£1,500 extra) is expected to be the most popular. It has two-tone paint, keyless entry and rear parking sensors.</p>
      <p>You have to opt for the S-Design (£1,500 more than the Iconic) to get the larger 9.3-inch touchscreen. It also gets front parking sensors and a reversing camera, plus some nice soft touch materials on the inside</p>
      <p>The new Captur continues to offer all the benefits of its predecessor, enhancing the package with better driveability, performance and refinement.</p>
