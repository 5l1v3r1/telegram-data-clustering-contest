      <p>Benjamin Kpodo, the Member of Parliament for Ho Central, has said the controversy around the Western Togoland movement demands National Security attention.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Citi News, he cautioned that the issue must not be treated as a localised problem.</p>
      <p>“From my end and quite a number of my colleagues, we think it is a national issue so the national apparatus for dealing with such security problems should take over. It should not be regionalised.”</p>
      <p>“Should we call MPs of those respective regions to go and deal with the issue? No. This is a national issue so I think reference should not be made to the Volta Region… It even goes beyond only National Security. The political authorities in Ghana should take it up and handle the issue.”</p>
      <p>His comments come after the Volta Regional Security Council arrested 10 members of the separatist movement, Homeland Study Group Foundation, on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The group declared the Volta Region through to parts of the Upper East region as the independent ‘Western Togoland State’.</p>
      <p>The leader of the group, 80-year old Charles Komi Kudzordzi, popularly known as Papavi Hobedetor, made the independence declaration at a public gathering in Ho on Saturday, November 16.</p>
      <p>He is yet to be arrested by security officials.</p>
      <p>Five members of the Western Togoland movement have been remanded on charges of treason felony after being arraigned at the Ho District court on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The group first made calls for the secession of the Volta Region through to parts of the Upper East region in May 2019.</p>
      <p>Over 80 members of the separatist group were arrested for assembling for a protest over the arrest of seven leaders of the Homeland Study Group Foundation back in May.</p>
      <p>It was also alleged that group leaders were training some youth to form the core of police and military activities in the supposed new country after the declaration of independence.</p>
