      <p><b>Spanish</b> newspaper <i>Marca </i>have slammed Gareth Bale after appearing to mock Real Madrid during Euro 2020 qualification celebrations with Wales.</p>
      <p>Bale celebrated with a Welsh flag that read, ‘Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order.’</p>
      <p>Now <i>Marca </i>have hit back with their front cover reading:  ‘Disrespectful. Wrong. Ungrateful. In that order.’</p>
      <p>Zinedine Zidane is not planning to punish Bale over his actions while on Wales duty, according to reports.</p>
      <p>There has been suggestions that Zidane might want to respond to Bale’s actions after he returns to Madrid on Thursday.</p>
      <p>But, according to Spanish outlet <i>Marca</i>, there are no plans to treat the 30-year-old differently to any other player.</p>
      <p>Zidane has long had an issue with Bale yet has decided not to respond to his latest antics.</p>
      <p>The French manager is planning to greet him, shake his hand and congratulate him for earning qualification before he trains as normal.</p>
      <p>Bale admitted he was aware of the chant and clearly saw the funny side of it.</p>
