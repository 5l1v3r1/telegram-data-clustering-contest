      <p>Walgreens made <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/walgreens-posts-higher-sales-11572262171">headlines</a> recently with the news that it was getting out of the walk-in clinic business. The news sparked interesting reactions across the industry. Some pundits pointed to managerial missteps; healthcare delivery insiders breathed a sigh of relief, while others shot a knowing smile that said, “I told you so. Healthcare is complex and retail stores can’t do healthcare delivery.” The closing of the 160 in-store clinics it had staffed was a disappointment for some, especially given the fanfare they’d received at opening about their potential as a disruptive business model. The event warrants deeper discussion about what it means for the industry. Is it a fundamentally bad idea to <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/31/walgreens-exit-of-health-clinic-business-is-a-warn.aspx">mix retail and healthcare</a>? Should other disruptors (e.g. CVS, Walmart, Amazon) take this as an omen? Should traditional healthcare delivery organizations be reassured that the danger is over? Or should disruptors see the misstep as an opportunity to learn what they need to do differently?</p>
      <p>Walgreens has chosen to maintain approximately 220 clinics that are run by local healthcare systems. So, maybe the walk-in clinic is <i>still</i> a good idea – if it’s run properly and has clear connections back to core operations and strategic business imperatives. If this is true, then the secret to success may just be in the quality of execution!</p>
      <p>As I wrote in <u>Bringing Value to Healthcare</u>, healthcare consumers have been shouldering an increasing percentage of their healthcare costs. Sensing an opportunity, retailers have entered healthcare delivery, offering lower costs and greater convenience. These new retail options – most notably from Walmart, Walgreens, and CVS – are in addition to the estimated 10,000 urgent care clinics which account for about 160 million visits annually. Located among neighborhood stores and in workplaces, shopping centers, and grocery stores, they appeal directly to consumers looking for quality service, easy access, and unambiguous pricing.</p>
      <p>In response to these new sources of competition, traditional healthcare delivery providers typically express concern. They publicly worry about the quality of care that’s offered and suggest that patients won’t receive appropriate diagnosis or treatment. While patient safety and quality of care should always be of utmost concern, these arguments miss an important point: if traditional delivery organizations were doing a better job of meeting patients’ needs, they wouldn’t be seeking out alternatives!</p>
      <p>Clearly, Walgreens and others didn’t move into this space for altruistic reasons. They saw an unmet need <i>and</i> a business opportunity. Repositioning themselves as treatment centers for selected patient segments could serve as an offset to pressure from online retailers on their pharmacy and in-store operations. Walgreens and CVS have taken different approaches to this space with Walgreens adopting a mixed “<a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/how-walgreens-cvs-see-the-future-of-pharmacy.html">partnership/ outsourcing model</a>” and CVS opting to own its assets through acquisition and/or building capacity.</p>
      <p>While they’ve taken different approaches, the financial results have been similar – barely breaking even as they attempt to move beyond the vaccinations, colds and treatment of minor acute issues, to the treatment of chronic conditions including diabetes and heart disease. Walgreens’ and CVS’ vast networks, their ease of access and the pharmacy data they collect on patients have been touted as the keys to success in this new effort. But the financial performance and Walgreens recent announcement suggest there is more to this picture.</p>
      <p>It takes a lot of work to change consumer perceptions. Merely establishing walk-in clinics doesn’t translate to becoming a destination for trusted advice and care. By the same token, filling prescriptions and selling OTC medications isn’t the same as being a healthcare provider – at least, not to consumers. And, establishing a new business costs money. The financial investment for Walgreens and the requirements for clinic success are very different from the ones facing healthcare delivery providers.</p>
      <p>Outsourcing clinic staffing to a healthcare system creates a natural cross-sell opportunity. Systems can steer patients back to their affiliated specialists, while leveraging retail accessibility and transparency to generate needed revenue. Even losses at the clinic level can be offset by referrals to in-network providers and by revenues from procedures that they might not otherwise have gotten.</p>
      <p>Walgreens and CVS can’t offset losses from clinic operations in that same way. But, there are other options. Retail clinics can generate additional script writing and front-of-store sales. And there is significant opportunity to increase sales volume with OTC products, recognizing that the latter are also challenged by Amazon. But, if you can bring people <i>into</i> the store, the crucial ingredient for success is personal contact – i.e. patient engagement. This is much easier said than done!</p>
      <p>Example in point. A colleague recently went to a local Dick’s Sporting Goods store in search of a knee brace anticipating the upcoming ski season. A proactive brace might help his knee and ski form! Dick’s had a whole section of high-end athletic products. There were multiple shelves of braces for knees, arms, elbows, wrists, backs and so forth. But there was no one who could speak intelligibly about any of them, so, despite price tags of $40 and up, he left the store empty-handed. If Dick’s had someone with the requisite experience and skills to speak knowledgeably about their products, a sale would have been made! Real money was left on the table.</p>
      <p>Dick’s is a retail operation. To them, it’s all about the transaction. They’re counting on convenience and the product’s manufacturer to make the brand and the product attractive enough that the sale largely closes itself. In that scenario, there’s little difference between the in-store experience and buying online.</p>
      <p>Dick’s put lots of products on the shelves but didn’t have anyone to help customers understand what they’re looking at. This mindset sets them up to squander the opportunity provided by customer traffic. When retailers are so busy trying to contain labor costs, they’re saving themselves into irrelevance.</p>
      <p>So, what’s the implication of this for Walgreens? The challenge for Walgreens and other retailers serious about healthcare will be shifting their transaction model to more of a one-on-one relationship model.</p>
      <p>Consumers don’t need in-store experts to help them with commodities. But they <i>do</i> need someone to talk about knee braces and serious health products. And, waiting in line or standing at a counter to get that information is neither convenient nor consumer friendly.</p>
      <p>The irony is that access and convenience were two of the things that walk-in clinics were set up to capitalize on, while driving front of store sales in the process. Running a successful clinic requires a mindset, skills, and a business model that’s different from retail. Retail organizations need to recognize that adding a clinic is not the same as adding a photo counter. Indeed, retail providers of healthcare may struggle to get beyond the transaction mindset in the same way as traditional providers struggle to become customer oriented.</p>
      <p>All players across the healthcare ecosystem have to address the harsh reality that creating a market-based model in healthcare requires a heavy lift.</p>
