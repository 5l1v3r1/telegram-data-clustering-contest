      <h1>Ronaldo focused on recovery after missing Atalanta trip</h1>

      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo says is focused on returning to full fitness after being left out of the Juventus squad for Saturday's Serie A game away to Atalanta.</p>
      <p>Head coach Maurizio Sarri told reporters Ronaldo was unlikely to be available for the trip to Bergamo and he was duly absent when the squad was named later on Friday.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo has been substituted in Juve's last two games, prompting rumours of a rift between the forward and Sarri, though both men have denied that is the case.</p>
      <p>It is unclear whether the Portugal star will be ready to return for Tuesday's Champions League group game at home to Atletico Madrid.</p>
      <p>"Focused on my recovery to come back soon!" Ronaldo posted on Instagram after being left out of the Juve squad.</p>
      <p>Serie A leaders Juve are on track to reach the next round of the Champions League after taking 10 points from their first four games in Group D.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo scored a hat-trick for Portugal in their 6-0 demolition of Lithuania before netting his 99th international goal in a 2-0 win against Luxembourg.</p>
      <p>Sarri previously said the 34-year-old is battling a knee issue and Ronaldo revealed he has been playing through pain.</p>
