        <b>Cristiano Ronaldo conceded he is not '100 percent' despite his goal spree for Portugal but always ready to play as injury-hit Juventus head to Atalanta on Saturday looking to extend their unbeaten run this season to stay top of Serie A.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Juventus </b>visit fifth-placed Atalanta before hosting Atletico Madrid in the Champions League next week.</p>
      <p><b>Maurizio Sarri's </b>side are just one point ahead of <b>Antonio Conte's </b>Inter Milan after 12 matches, with Lazio and Cagliari eight points adrift of the leaders in joint third.</p>
      <p><b>Atalanta </b>have gone three league games without a win and will be eager to get back into the Champions League berths, as they sit two points off fourth place, before next week's trip to Shakhtar Donetsk.</p>
      <p>Atalanta's fortunes have slipped following the thigh injury suffered to Colombian star Duvan Zapata, who scored six goals in six <b>Serie A </b>matches before being sidelined for their last five league games.</p>
      <p>As <b>Atalanta </b>sweat on <b>Zapata's return</b>, Juventus will be without full-back <b>Alex Sandro</b>, who picked up a thigh problem playing for Brazil, with Blaise Matuidi recovering from a rib injury.</p>
      <p><b>Ronaldo </b>had said he was not be at his best physical form, with Sarri saying the Portuguese star has a "<b>little knee problem</b>".</p>
      <p>But the 34-year-old wants to make amends after storming off when he was substituted in Juventus's last game against <b>AC Milan</b>.</p>
      <p>"In the last three weeks,<b> I have played at a slightly reduced capacity</b>," Ronaldo conceded after his goal spree for Portugal.</p>
      <p>"<b>I don't like to be replaced, no one does</b>," added Ronaldo. "I tried to help Juve even when injured."</p>
      <p>Full-back Danilo, who scored his first goal for Brazil during the international break, warned: "The games after the international break are never easy, let alone against Atalanta, a team who are doing well.Â </p>
      <p>"<b>We can't make mistakes</b> or underestimate them."</p>
      <p><b>Inter </b>will be looking to make it a perfect seven league games on the road this season as they travel to Torino, before their European trip to Slavia Prague.</p>
      <p>Conte's side face a tough task against the Andrea <b>Belotti</b>-powered Torino, who ended their six-match winless run against Brescia last time out, and are in 11th position.</p>
      <p>Serie A runners-up <b>Napoli </b>are in crisis, having slipped to seventh, and desperately need a result at 14th-placed AC Milan, who are themselves floundering.</p>
      <p><b>Cagliari </b>and <b>Lazio </b>will look to continue their strong form at lowly Lecce and Sassuolo respectively.</p>
      <p><b>Roma </b>have a chance to move into the <b>Champions League </b>places as the look to bounce back from last week's defeat to <b>Parma </b>at home against tailenders <b>Brescia</b>.</p>
