      <h1>‘Gundam 0080’ Blu-Ray Review: Still A Heartbreaking Masterpiece</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Ollie Barder</a></address>
      <p>Back when I <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2017/04/21/gundam-0080-dvd-review-a-heartbreaking-masterpiece/">reviewed the DVD release</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_0080:_War_in_the_Pocket"><i>Gundam 0080</i></a> a few years back, I never thought we would actually see the series come Westward on Blu-ray. Well, now it has and it is still a heartbreaking masterpiece.Set just before the end of the <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/One_Year_War">One Year War</a>, <i>Gundam 0080</i> deals with a separate side story from the main narrative and characters seen in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2016/08/23/mobile-suit-gundam-bluray-review-the-animation-is-dated-but-the-story-and-characters-are-timeless/"><i>Mobile Suit Gundam</i></a>. Instead, it focuses on a more local conflict around a singular colony and the secrets it holds.</p>
      <p>The result is a more personal and human tale told from the perspective of a small boy called <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Alfred_Izuruha">Alf Izuruha</a>.</p>
      <p>Like most kids, he thinks the war and <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Mobile_Weapon">mobile suits</a> are cool, without understanding the very real dangers and costs to human life that both incur.</p>
      <p>It’s here when <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Principality_of_Zeon">Zeon</a> invades Alf’s colony and he gets to see mobile suits up close for the first time. He also befriends a downed rookie <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/MS-06FZ_Zaku_II_Kai">Zaku</a> pilot called <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Bernard_Wiseman">Bernie</a> and ends up aiding his cause.</p>
      <p>This is because Zeon rightly thinks that there is a <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/RX-78NT-1_Gundam_%22Alex%22">new Gundam prototype</a> being built and tested on Alf’s colony. So they send in the elite <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Cyclops_Team">Cyclops Team</a> to deal with the threat.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Alf, this particular conflict ends up having very direct and awful consequences and it’s this that makes <i>Gundam 0080</i> special within the <i>Gundam</i> canon.</p>

      <p>Unlike the mainline series and movies written and directed by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2017/03/13/yoshiyuki-tomino-on-gundam-newtypes-and-the-perilous-future-facing-humanity/">Yoshiyuki Tomino</a>, <i>Gundam 0080</i> eschews much of the <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Newtype">Newtype</a> aspects and takes a grittier approach to mobile suit combat as well as the One Year War in general.</p>
      <p><i>Gundam 0080</i> also deviated in a stylistic way as well. From the lovely character designs by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruhiko_Mikimoto">Haruhiko Mikimoto</a> to the more grounded mecha designs by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2018/11/05/yutaka-izubuchi-on-designing-the-most-popular-gundam-ever-and-his-love-of-kaiju/">Yutaka Izubuchi</a>.</p>
      <p>The mecha designs are also notable here as Izubuchi had to work within the confines of the One Year War era of mobile suits. So his own variants of classic designs still needed to hold true to what fans expected.</p>
      <p>The results are a series that has endured and resonated with fans the world over and now it is finally available in Blu-ray format.</p>
      <p>Like other <i>Gundam</i> related releases from Right Stuf Anime, this set is pretty typical. In that it lacks much in the way of extras, bar the <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/All_That_Gundam">All That Gundam</a> short.</p>
      <p>However, this is made up for with a wonderful transfer in terms of the visuals and audio. It really does look and sound pristine and does this anime justice.</p>
      <p>So if you missed out on the DVD release of <i>Gundam 0080</i> a few years back, then you should absolutely pick up this classic mecha anime. Though you should be warned that you will likely cry hot tears before the end.</p>
      <p><i>Gundam 0080</i> is currently released on Blu-ray and is available via <a href="https://www.rightstufanime.com/Mobile-Suit-Gundam-0080-War-In-the-Pocket-Blu-ray">Right Stuf Anime</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Disclosure: Right Stuf Anime sent me a copy of this series on Blu-ray for this review.</i>
