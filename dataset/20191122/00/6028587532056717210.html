      <p>What can you do when you've reached the pinnacle of your success as a freelance marketing <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abdullahimuhammed/2017/03/15/how-to-become-a-highly-paid-freelance-consultant/">consultant</a> or independent service provider? Evolving into a marketing agency is the most logical step. That's certainly a great way to combine your marketing talents with your entrepreneurial dreams. To scale successfully, however, it's not enough to replace your name with a catchy brand and create a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abdullahimuhammed/2017/06/21/5-tips-for-bundling-your-freelance-services-into-profitable-packages/">bundled services package</a>. You will also need to update your business methods, especially those related to sales and marketing. Your brand and online reputation will certainly help promote your agency in the early days, but it won't be enough to maintain a steady influx of leads in the long run as you scale. </p>
      <p>Below are several hacks agency owners use to generate consistent buzz and attract relevant high-paying prospects. </p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Create branding that is memorable and consistent</b>
      </p>
      <p>A lot of marketing agencies lack 'personality.' They look too much alike, all promising the next big thing. To appear different and more memorable, invest in creating a unique brand. </p>
      <p>Take <a href="https://conversionsciences.com/">Conversion Sciences</a>, for example, a CRO agency. They have become known in the industry as the folks in the lab coats. And their entire branding experience, along with their content, is tied into a science theme. It works for them on several levels.</p>
      <p>First, it's simple, catchy and memorable. In addition to this, they have chosen branding that is synonymous with intelligence. Finally, all of the scientific branding ties very well into their claims to use data as the backbone of their conversion optimization strategies.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Focus on pain point SEO</b>
      </p>
      <p>A keyword-first strategy drives traditional SEO. In addition to this, success is defined by traffic and ranking. Pain point SEO flips this strategy on its head.</p>
      <p>“Instead of focusing on the apparent industry keywords and creating content around them, you should determine your customers' needs first,” said Stephen Gagnon, CEO of <a href="https://parxavenue.ca/">Parxavenue</a>. “Once you understand their needs or pain points, you can create content specifically to help them with those. This gives you an unfair advantage. You can then focus on measuring what truly matters such as leads and signups while everyone else only chases after traffic.”</p>
      <p>One of the reasons this strategy is so useful today is that Google and other search engines are better able than ever to understand search intent. This means that content that solves users' problems is more likely to do better than content that just happens to contain specific keywords. So, understand the needs of your potential clients first, write content that is relevant for them, then worry about optimizing for long-tail keywords.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Micro-segment leads with a form</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not every client heading your way will be a good fit. Also, different clients will experience different 'pain points.' Pitching them the same 'standard' solution will unlikely result in high conversion rates. </p>
      <p>To better understand how you should approach each client, create a simple form that allows you to capture additional information about potential clients and micro-segment them, respectively.</p>
      <p>"We specialize in working with healthcare providers and have three key marketing offerings," said Andrew Epprecht, CEO of <a href="https://phase5analytics.com/">Phase 5 Analytics</a>. "To create better price quotes, we ask prospects to fill in a quick intake form indicating their budget, current traffic, preferred services and their website URL. After doing a quick analysis, we filter out people who can't afford us and refer them to someone else and provide personalized replies to other prospects."</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Reach your audience with a podcast</b>
      </p>
      <p>Podcasting is still one of the less saturated promotion channels that hold strong potential. In fact, one agency's decision to start a podcast led to them <a href="https://nativeadvertisinginstitute.com/blog/podcast-digital-marketing-agency/">doubling in size</a>. To successfully launch their podcast, they implemented strategies to help ensure their content would be appealing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Varying topics to gain the interest of many different customers.</li>
        <li>Leading off episodes with tidbits from trending news articles.</li>
        <li>Diving deep into subject matter that was certain to hold the audience's interest.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition to airing each episode as a podcast, they also recycle the content for YouTube. This is done by breaking down the episodes into shorter videos and then distributing them on the brand's YouTube channel. This satisfies the needs of potential clients who want their content in more bite-sized chunks.</p>
      <p>Marketing your business is a must if you want to scale and grow your revenue. Large enterprises invest millions of dollars in marketing in recognition of its importance. If you’re a startup or an agency though, chances are that you’re working on a budget. You therefore need more creativity to succeed with your <a href="https://www.alligatr.com/">small business marketing</a> and stay ahead of the competition.</p>
      <p>Your agency's success will strongly depend on your commitment to creating relevant and engaging content to attract the right prospects, exploring new channels for reaching more people and improving your lead closure rates. Implementing these strategies should help you accomplish just that.</p>
