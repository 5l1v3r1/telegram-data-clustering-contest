      <p>Plastic as an environmental threat has reached a scale where it can no longer be ignored.  We are haunted with disturbing images of the damage done as a result of our overuse of the material and the careless disposal of products made from it. Millions of plastic water bottles floating in the sea and desperate turtles with straws embedded in their noses make the issue concrete to consumers. Thanks to growing awareness about the issue, the tide has turned against companies relying on these products. Well-publicized campaigns by <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40580132/here-are-the-u-s-cities-that-have-banned-plastic-straws-so-far">states, cities, and large companies</a> have begun to tackle the subject of phasing out plastic straws and <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/plastic-bag-legislation.aspx">NY decided to ban single-use plastic bags</a> this year (the third state to do so since California first banned them in 2014).While it’s great that we are mobilizing and talking about plastics, there is little conversation about how the devices we depend on to fuel our outrage (#plasticban) and further the cause are also big offenders and arguably worse than the occasional bottle of artisanal spring water in terms of impact.</p>

        <b>There’s More Than Meets The Eye With E-Plastic (30%)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Given the myriad toxic materials that make up the average phone or tablet, plastic appears to be the least of our concerns when it comes to e-waste...except that it accounts for <a href="https://resource-recycling.com/e-scrap/2019/05/09/whats-needed-to-recover-e-plastics-domestically/">25-30% of the end-of-life electronics stream</a> and, as it turns out, may be doing double damage. “E-plastics” are not only damaging to the environment per se, they also pose a significant impediment to the overall recycling efforts involved in properly breaking down, reusing and/or properly disposing of a device’s components.</p>
      <p>E-plastics must be processed, along with other low-value and/or hazardous wastes, when extracting the valuable minerals and materials in the literal goldmine that is our old electronics; unfortunately, this can be a complicated and expensive process that ends up offsetting the value of any reusable materials extracted. This is certainly the case for plastics, which must be separated by polymer type and flame retardant content. This is no simple matter since <a href="https://resource-recycling.com/plastics/2018/12/11/how-to-progress-on-e-plastics/">the overall compositions of plastics in electronics scrap in the US is not very clear and little data is publicly available.</a> </p>
      <p>It is precisely for this reason that we used to outsource this work to China, where <a href="https://www.ptonline.com/articles/recycling-e-plastics-new-material-stream-brings-its-own-set-of-problems">99% of our e-plastics</a> were previously sent to be recycled. Today, these large volumes of plastic must now be dealt with locally—which means that much of it now <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/03/china-has-stopped-accepting-our-trash/584131/">ends up in our landfills or getting burned</a> simply because we don’t have the resources to process them. Plastics containing brominated flame retardant <a href="https://www.drweil.com/health-wellness/balanced-living/healthy-home/are-flame-retardants-toxic/">release carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide when burned</a> making this even more problematic.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Way Forward</b>
      </p>
      <p>This doesn’t mean that people aren’t looking for ways to recycle and profit from e-plastics. Last year, researchers succeeded in creating <a href="https://www.waste360.com/plastics/illinois-researchers-develop-method-recycling-plastic-e-waste">a new process</a> to recover plastic from complex polycarbonate plastic blends found in electronics using a non-toxic solvent called NMP. For the moment, however, this process has only been tested on small batches and is yet to be considered ready for industrial use. </p>
      <p>Some manufacturers, like <a href="https://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/corp-comm/closed-loop-recycled-content">Dell</a> and <a href="https://press.ext.hp.com/us/en/blogs/2018/hp-sources-more-than-550-000-pounds-of-ocean-bound-plastic-for-n.html">HP</a> have brought closed-loop plastics recycling into their business models. Recycling, especially in a closed-loop, is an essential piece of the puzzle, but <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vianneyvaute/2018/10/29/recycling-is-not-the-answer-to-the-e-waste-crisis">it is not enough</a>. As with plastic bottles and plastic bags, the rate of consumption is at the heart of the issue. Fortunately, preventing electronic waste is, in a way, even easier than remembering to carry around a reusable bottle and canvas bag. It only requires that we use our electronics for as long as we can, repair them when possible, and finally, responsibly send them out to be recycled when their time has come and not before. </p>
