      <p>It's been more than twenty years since Netscape first announced it would pay hackers to report vulnerabilities found within its browser. Now, many organizations financially reward hackers for the internal reporting of software bugs. The bigger the bug, the bigger the bounty. But with both <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/08/08/apple-confirms-1-million-reward-for-hackers-who-find-serious-iphone-vulnerabilities/">Apple </a>and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/11/21/google-bug-bounty-hits-1-million-if-you-can-hack-its-phones/">Google each offering one million dollars for bugs</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/katie-moussouris/">Katie Moussouris, CEO of Luta Security</a>, thinks things may have gotten a little out of hand. Speaking earlier this month at the <a href="https://www.disclosureconference.com/">Disclosure Conference in San Francisco</a>, Moussouris said, "if you have the capacity to start a bug bounty program— and spend that kind of money on outside research— don't you first want to think through exactly what you want to get out of this? Do you want to pay for the easiest low-hanging fruit that doesn't require any special skills? Or do you want invest that money first on internal discoverability and elimination of those classes of bugs, and then go for the higher-hanging fruit?"</p>
      <p>She continued, "there's also this whole situation where bug platforms are encouraging people to start these things as soon as possible. What we see reported on average is mostly cross-site scripting, some evolving into authentication issues, which is a broad category that could be things like PII (personally identifiable information) that has no authentication. Is that low-hanging fruit? It is. It is also what I call the 'Bounty Botox.' This is a surface-level appearance of looking busy, but you're not getting more secure."</p>
      <p>While the desire to start a bug bounty program may start with good intentions, organizations often lack hard data, Moussouris said. "Some will say bug bounties are the only way we can get that many eyes on something. Let's take a look. Signup numbers are huge for these [bug bounty] platforms." She cited one example with 300,000 bug submissions, yet only 1 out of 10 amounted to anything. A few hackers she said did earn as much as $5K per bug.</p>
      <p>This also shows that hackers are not necessarily getting rich from bug bounties. From this same example, only 100 hackers earned six-figure salaries, which, Moussouris said, you could earn as a full-time pen tester. "Maybe there's two or five bug bounty millionaires out there but none of the platforms want to specify how long it took them to reach the million dollar mark. If you break that million dollars out over several years, it's approximately a pen tester's annual salary."</p>
      <p>Moussouris said it's also a myth that hackers will only look for bugs in exchange for cash. "There's a balance between compensation and recognition, and it might not always be fame but recognition from your peers or a pursuit of intellectual happiness, of solving a problem, of solving a challenge. Everyone has these balances of why do what they do personally."</p>
      <p>Consider someone who made six figures —$119K— from one bounty program, Moussouris said. When broken down to the amount of time spent discovering several bugs, she estimated the value for each was about $29K per hour. "I don't think the [pen testers] are paid $29K per hour," she said. Despite this large payout, this person did go on and get a full-time job as a pen tester for an organization. Why? "Because he had a daughter, and wanted to work less and spend more time with her," she said.</p>
      <p>Moussouris also argued that offering more and more money for bug bounties does little to affect the balance between offensive security and defensive security. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertvamosi/2015/04/20/leveling-the-software-vulnerability-market/">In a previous Forbes interview in 2015</a>, she said her work with a  MIT and Harvard vulnerability model showed that paying a high price for software vulnerabilities appears to have economic downsides. "There's a logical limit and a ceiling to how much a market can actually offer before they essentially drain the talent pool among all the developers and testers who are very familiar with how certain code works," she said. "If there was a $100K —or more— bounty for individual bugs in that code they know so well, why would [software engineers] keep their day jobs?"</p>
      <p>Echoing this data point again at Disclosure, Moussouris said Apple's new million dollar bug bounty program creates some unintended risks. "How many developers at Apple make a million dollars? How many testers? How many young people who have never had a job before would be down with going into the office and hanging out for all those meetings when they could instead make a million dollars? In fact, you are rupturing your labor pipeline. You are hemorrhaging your labor pipeline if you think 'let's just keep having the prices go up'. I'm all for hackers making a million dollars but this is more damaging to the preventive end. The preventive stuff where you have to build security in, who's going to build that?"</p>
      <p>Bug bounty programs do not absolve an organization from doing basic software hygiene. "You've effectively outsourced triage," Moussouris said, "but you've outsourced to a bunch of random inspectors. And there's a limited number of them that are actually good. It's not about finding the bugs — plenty of folks are finding bugs — but also many duplicates. The duplicates are happening because the fruit is low hanging. Bug bounties are not a replacement for penetration testers."</p>
      <p>Moussouris again reminded the audience of the vulnerability maturity model and said that it's not all engineering either. "The vulnerability team would be more successful if the legal and communications team understood the concepts we were trying to promote," she said. "We are trying to get you to fix it. And, no, a 90-day deadline is not threatening you. It's actually acting in the best interests of the users. We don't want this bug sitting out there forever."</p>
      <p>What should be the ultimate goal? "What you want to see is a progression from a lot of low hanging fruit that anyone can find to fewer and fewer bugs that are more complex," Moussouris said. "Do we get this type of measure from bug bounty programs as they stand? No."</p>
