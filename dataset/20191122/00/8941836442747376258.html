      <p>DALLAS (AP) - Jamie Benn used a lesson from his youth baseball days to help score the tiebreaking goal Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Benn backhanded the winner with 4:21 left, and the rolling <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Dallas Stars</a> beat the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/winnipeg/">Winnipeg</a> Jets 5-3 after blowing a three-goal lead.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t having a very good game, and even started that shift with a turnover,” Benn said. “I was thinking about after they scored, my dad taught me a pretty good lesson in baseball. If you go 0 for 3, you have another chance to go up to the plate and you can be a hero.”</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> captain has scored four of his five goals in the last three games.</p>
      <p>“He was all over the puck,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> coach Jim Montgomery said. “I think he was refusing to let us lose.”</p>

      <p>Teammate <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/corey-perry/">Corey Perry</a> assisted on all three second-period goals that staked <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> to a 3-0 lead. He wasn’t surprised by Benn.</p>
      <p>“Once goal scorers get confident, you feel it and then they start streaking.”</p>
      <p>The whole <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> team is streaking. They have won five in a row, with a 10-game point streak and a 12-1-1 record in the last 14 games that has vaulted them into third place in the Central Division.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/winnipeg/">Winnipeg</a> came into the game with five wins in six games and a five-game road winning streak.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> goalie Ben Bishop made 23 saves in his sixth straight win. The Jets’ Connor Hellebuyck stopped 31 shots.</p>
        <p>Mattias Janmark returned from injury to score the game’s first goal. Jason Dickinson and Radek Faksa also scored in the second. Tyler Seguin added an empty-netter with 35 seconds to play.</p>
        <p>For <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/winnipeg/">Winnipeg</a>, Kyle Connor scored in the second period. In the third, Patrik Laine scored his 17th goal in 15 career games against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a>, and Luca Sbisa tied it with his first goal for the Jets at 15:14.</p>
        <p>Twenty-five seconds later, Benn broke the tie.</p>
        <p>Janmark said from the bench he could see the play coming.</p>
        <p>“He was just hunting the puck, like you could see that he was out there to score a goal. That’s what he’s done throughout the years when he’s been at his best, so it’s always good to see.”</p>
        <p>Jets coach Paul Maurice liked his team’s battle to the 3-3 tie.</p>
        <p>“They haven’t quit in a game all year,” he said. “I don’t think it was easy for us tonight in terms of execution, and we have a few miles on us. The heart was there.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/winnipeg/">Winnipeg</a> had failed to connect during an extended power-play chance in the first. The Jets controlled the puck for more than a minute following a tripping penalty by Andrew Cogliano and got three shots on goal before <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> could force a whistle. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/winnipeg/">Winnipeg</a> had no shots during the 2-minute power play.</p>
        <p>Janmark scored at 7:37 of the second period. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/corey-perry/">Perry</a> dropped the puck back to Andrej Sekera at the right point. Hellebuyck made a pad save on Sekera’s shot, but the rebound went to Janmark for a wrist shot.</p>
        <p>Dickinson gave the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> a 2-0 lead at 9:43 when he tipped Taylor Fedun’s shot from the blue line over Hellebuyck’s left shoulder. The Jets challenged, claiming the play was offside, but the video replay upheld the goal.</p>
        <p>Faksa’s shot from the right faceoff dot popped into the air in front of the net and the puck was knocked across the goal line at 13:19.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/winnipeg/">Winnipeg</a>’s first goal came 39 seconds later, when Connor put a wrist shot past Bishop.</p>
        <p>NOTES: Janmark missed four games because of a lower-body injury. … Faksa has an eight-game point streak. D Miro Heiskanen assisted on Seguin’s goal for a career-high five-game scoring streak. … <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/corey-perry/">Perry</a> has a goal and four assists in the last two games, and two three-point games this season. His three assists were his most since he had four for Anaheim at Toronto Feb. 5, 2018. … Winnipeg C Mark Scheifele, who assisted on Connor’s goal, has 31 points in 27 games vs. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a>.</p>
