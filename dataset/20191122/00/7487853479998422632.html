      <h3>Tottenham Leading Race for Ex-Newcastle Star's Son</h3>

      <p>One of Jose Mourinho's first signings as Tottenham Hotspur manager could be...a 14-year-old?! Hmmm...doesn't seem massively on-brand for Jose.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7714221/Tottenham-join-race-sign-Newcastle-starlet-Bobby-Clark.html?fbclid=IwAR34xHRuw3eTnVaXjGJWCt_OGyH7oKN_9Dj61Ero6BSyh8x4MlghGW8Qs3w">​The Mail</a> claim that highly rated <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/newcastle">​Newcastle United</a> prospect Bobby Clark is wanted by several clubs, but <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/tottenham">​Spurs</a> are the frontrunners.</p>
      <p>The English Freddy Adu (as no-one is calling him...yet) is actually the son of former Newcastle star Lee Clark, who played for the Magpies as well as Sunderland and Fulham. That's him pictured above by the way, because obviously there are no pictures of his son around. </p>
      <p>The Mail's report adds that Clark Jnr debuted for the Under-18s aged just 14 years and 206 days this season, while the young midfielder is being monitored by both Manchester clubs, Chelsea and Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>While Clark (and his first-team manager Steve Bruce) is against a move, the boy's parents could persuade him to switch to a club with better infrastructure.</p>

      <h3>The Inevitable Return of the Portuguese Media Campaign to Get Bruno Fernandes to the Prem</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fsporting-cp-v-belenenses-liga-nos-5dd7f3778317e254f8000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8888888888888888&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.013333333333333334&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>

      <p>Meanwhile at Tottenham, Portuguese outlet A Bola are delighting in the fact Mourinho has rocked up at Spurs, calling his arrival 'the perfect scenario' for a move for the much-discussed (mostly by the Portuguese media) Bruno Fernandes.</p>
      <p>The report as translated by <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/tottenham-ready-make-new-bid-midfielder-shown-can-pay-e60m-bonuses/">​SportWitness</a> claims Spurs could offer up to €60m (that's £51m and change) plus another €10m in bonuses.</p>
      <p>Slightly more exciting than a 14-year-old, Spurs fans?</p>
      <p>“I was surprised by the season of Bruno Fernandes," Mourinho <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6501006-jose-mourinho-claimed-tottenham-transfer-target-bruno-fernandes-has-it-all">​said over the summer</a>. "He strikes the ball well, heads well, cool when he is one-on-one with the goalkeeper. He finds space in the penalty area. It’s all there.”</p>
      <p>Fernandes was in top form last season, famously having a direct hand in 50 goals in just 53 appearances for Sporting CP, but didn't move in the summer despite everyone and anyone being linked. </p>
      <p>He has continued to shine this season, contributing five goals and five assists in ten outings.</p>
      <p>Naturally, expect Tottenham to end January with Nemanja Matic instead.</p>

      <h3>Everton &amp; Milan Tipped for Striker Flop Swap</h3>

        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fisrael-v-poland-uefa-euro-2020-qualifier-5dd7f336727cd9a809000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8281668222844694&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=0.8428571428571429&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.06316526610644257&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>

      <p>If there's one thing Everton bloody love, it's expensive strikers who can't hit a cow's arse with a banjo.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.calciomercato.it/news/357106/calciomercato_milan_piatek_sul_mercato_scambio_tra_attaccanti">​Calciomercato</a> suggests that the Toffees still haven't had their fill of disappointing forwards and could be involved in a plot to bring Polish goal machine turned flop Krzysztof Piatek in from Milan in January.</p>
      <p>The report suggests AC Milan could look to exchange Piatek for 19-year-old Moise Kean, who is yet to score in any competition for Everton this season, after arriving in the summer for near £25m.</p>
      <p>Even by <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/everton">​Everton</a> standards, this one seems a bit far-fetched.</p>

      <h3>Everton Not the Only Ones Counting on Geiger</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fgermany-u21-v-belgium-u21-uefa-under-21-european-qualifier-5dd7f319727cd95aa0000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.7841394335511981&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=0.88&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.055373482726423895&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.12&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Over in Germany, the Toffees are also credited with an interest in Dennis Geiger, the 21-year-old Hoffenheim star, who has also been linked with Man City and Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sport1.de/fussball/uefa-u21-em-2019/2019/11/dennis-geiger-von-der-tsg-hoffenheim-weckt-interesse-der-topklubs">​SPORT1</a> say that the Germany Under-21 star has a contract that runs until 2022, while there is no release clause in his deal. However, that has not put off some of Europe's biggest clubs.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's City have made enquiries while Everton too are interested. Oh yeah, and Bayern are name-checked in the report because well of course they are.</p>

      <h3>Bayern Munich Star Tipped for Romantic Return to Spain</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Ffc-bayern-muenchen-v-borussia-dortmund-bundesliga-5dd7f2e2727cd98fba000010.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8113289760348584&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=0.98&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.0408029878618114&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.02&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>

      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/bayern">​Bayern</a> may have space in their midfield for a new midfielder actually with veteran Javi Martinez tipped for a return to Athletic Club.</p>
      <p>ETB (via <a href="https://as.com/futbol/2019/11/19/primera/1574200124_373028.html">​AS</a>) say that the Bilbao side will pay up to €10m (£8.5m) for the 31-year-old.</p>
      <p>Martinez - who has started just four times in all competitions this season - left Athletic Club for Munich in 2012, after making over 250 appearances for the Basques.</p>
      <p>There isn't much speculation on how likely the sentimental transfer actually is, but after seven Bundesliga titles, Martinez may well be up for a new challenge like helping Bilbao get back into Europe.</p>

      <h3>Barcelona Tell Defender to Todi-Go</h3>

      <p>Jean Clair Todibo, we hardly knew ye.</p>
      <p>The French teenage defender joined <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/barca">​Barcelona</a> in January of this year from Toulouse and has played...four times.</p>
      <p>The centre back has played 77 minutes of football in 2019/20, most of which came in the 4-0 win over Sevilla. However, it seems he is already being deemed surplus to requirements, as the priority for January is 'streamlining' according to <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/barca-are-looking-to-sell-todibo-to-bayer-leverkusen-in-january-7744445?_ga=2.81647262.801152053.1574355020-843256910.1536911570">​SPORT</a>.</p>
      <p>Their report claims Barça want €10m plus a buyback clause for the young star, in a move that seems very Yerry Mina.</p>
      <p>It is said that Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen are already close to a deal.</p>

      <h3>Man Utd in a 'Rush' for Zaniolo</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Ffbl-euro-2020-qualifier-ita-arm-5dd7f2918317e26694000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8888888888888888&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.017142857142857144&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>And last but not least, well maybe least likely, <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">​Manchester United</a> want to 'rush' through a deal for Roma star Nicolo Zaniolo, according to <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/man-united-send-scout-watch-serie-starlet-monday-intention-rush-things-price-rises-much/">​Il Messaggero</a> in Italy.</p>
      <p>Before you shoot the <i>messaggero, </i>the claim is that United sent scouts to watch 20-year-old Zaniolo and his teammate Sandro Tonali in Italy's 9-1 win over Armenia.</p>
      <p>Zaniolo scored twice in that drubbing, prompting United to make haste in their approach.</p>
      <p>It is said that the Red Devils are trying to discuss a deal, while they already have Roma at the negotiating table over a permanent deal for Chris Smalling. That still seems weird, doesn't it? </p>
