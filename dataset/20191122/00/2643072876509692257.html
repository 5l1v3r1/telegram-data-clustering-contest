      <p>The decision of a Kano state high court that sacked<a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/21/just-in-high-court-sacks-kano-emirs-installed-by-ganduje/"><u><b> four emirs</b> </u></a>appointed by <b>Abdullahi Ganduje</b>, governor of the state has attracted a reaction from him.</p>
      <p>Naija News<a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/06/14/kano-emirate-court-dismisses-suit-stopping-new-emirs-from-carrying-out-their-activities/"><u><b> recalls</b></u></a> that Usman Na’Abba, the presiding judge, gave the order on Thursday. His judgment averred that the creation of the Emirates and appointment of four first Emirs was illegal.</p>
      <p>However, the Kano State Government has reacted to the Thursday’s court ruling dissolving the four new first-class emirates created by the state government and sacking the emirs appointed to head them.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that the Kano State governor, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/09/26/kano-gandujes-latest-plot-against-emir-sanusi-revealed/"><u><b>Abdullahi Ganduje</b></u></a>, rejected the ruling through a statement by the Commissioner for Information in the state, Mallam Muhammad Garba.</p>
      <p>Garba said the state was studying the ruling of the court on the creation of four new emirates with a view to taking immediate appropriate action. He also posited that the government will not fold its arms and concede such constitutional power in the interest of the well-being of the people and general development of the state.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in a related development, some residents of Bichi in Kano State took to the streets yesterday to protest over a court ruling that nullified the new emirates.</p>
      <p>Carrying placards, the protesters also met with Emir Aminu Ado Bayero who was returning from Daura and expressed their displeasure over the development.</p>
      <p>They told the emir that despite the court ruling, they are still with him and regard him as their first-class emir.</p>
