        <b>CHRISTMAS MARKETS in Ireland are kind of a big thing.</b>
      </p>
      <p>While the annual Galway Christmas Market is renowned as being one of the best in the country, one town is giving Galway a run for its money this year as they announce the addition of an alpaca experience to their roster of entertainment!</p>
      <p>(I don't know about you, but every time I visit a Christmas market, in among all the mulled wine, beer, Christmas music and festive food I always think 'Man, the one thing missing from this place is a couple of alpacas'.)</p>
      <p>This year, the Wicklow Christmas Market in the town's Abbey Grounds will host a number of alpacas to help spread the festive cheer-- and we really hope that means the animals will be in Santa hats.</p>

      <p>The alpacas belong to company K2, who organise different alpaca-themed events in the county, such as trekking along the mountains with the friendly animals-- you can find out more on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/k2alpacas/">Facebook</a> page or <a href="https://k2alpacas.ie/alpaca-trekking-events/">website</a>.</p>
      <p>But even without the alpacas, Wicklow's Christmas Market looks set to be a big one this year, with artisan foods, unique handmade gifts and live entertainment such as fire shows, puppet shows, a funfair and a brand new Santa Express train, driven by one of Santa's favourite elves Oribel!</p>
      <p>The experience will be full of lights, music and excitement-- but there is also a special sensory Santa Train on December 8th from 11am-12pm where the lights and music will be dimmed, allowing everyone to share in the magical experience.</p>
      <p>The Wicklow Christmas Market will be open on November 23rd, 24th and 30th.</p>
      <p>The December dates will be the 1st, 7th, 14th and 15th, from 12pm - 6pm.</p>
      <p>For more information on the market you can visit the website <a href="https://www.wicklowchristmasmarket.com/">here</a>.</p>
