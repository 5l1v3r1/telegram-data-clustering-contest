      <p>The Management of Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi (KNUST), in its effort to improve ICT education, has donated 560 pieces of brand new customized smart laptop computers to Seventy-Four (74) selected less endowed Senior High Schools as well as basic schools in the country. The donation also forms part of the University’s Corporate Social Responsibility.</p>
      <p>Professor Kwasi-Obiri-Danso, Vice-Chancellor of KNUST, mentioned that it is the responsibility of KNUST to ensure that students admitted into the University have the knowledge and ability to utilize computers and related technologies efficiently, with a range of skills covering levels from elementary use of computer programs to advanced problem solving, and are of acceptable quality. This he said, formed the basis for the donation. ‘’As the world is driven by science and technology, it has become very vital that the University contributes its widow’s mite to assist less endowed schools in their quest to match the growing standards of ICT education’’, he said.</p>
      <p>Commenting on other interventions put in place to support students from deprived backgrounds, Prof. Obiri-Danso announced that Mastercard Foundation Scholars Program at KNUST has awarded 750 comprehensive scholarships to persons from less endowed schools to enable them to gain access to quality and transformative university education. He, therefore, advised headmasters, headmistresses, and teachers from less endowed schools to encourage their students to study hard in order to benefit from the various scholarship schemes and other opportunities available to brilliant but financially challenged students in KNUST.</p>
      <p>Presenting the laptop computers to the recipients of the selected schools, the Vice-Chancellor of KNUST, Prof. Obiri-Danso applauded the good work done by the heads and teachers across Ghana for their selflessness. He observed that though teachers are often looked down upon by society, all professionals owe them great gratitude; he observed that, without teachers, there will be no Doctors, Engineers, Pharmacists or other professionals. He, therefore, charged the teachers not to waver in their determination to build a better society.</p>
      <p>Applauding the government for introducing the Free SHS policy, Prof. Obiri-Danso observed that the policy is a good one that needs the support of all Ghanaians irrespective of their political affiliation; stressing that, it is better to educate a society without jobs than to have an illiterate jobless society. According to him, he believes that educated people could help create jobs for themselves and others; making society a better place.</p>
      <p>Receiving the items on behalf of the schools, Mrs. Sylvia Nelson, Headmistress of Akomadan Senior High School, representing the Regional Director of GES, thanked the University for surprising less endowed schools in Ghana with such a kind gesture. She hoped that KNUST would continually support and contribute its quota in the shaping of future generations.</p>
      <p>Present at the ceremony were the Registrar of KNUST, Mr. Andrews Kwasi Boateng, College Provosts, College Registrars, Directors, Deans, Headteachers and ICT teachers of the selected less endowed schools.</p>
