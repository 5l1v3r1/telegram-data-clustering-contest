      <p>FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) - Three outfitter guides have been banned from northern Arizona forests after being convicted of illegally operating commercial businesses.</p>
      <p>Forest officials say the guides didn’t have the required authorization or permits.</p>
      <p>The three guides were sentenced to a year of unsupervised probation and ordered to pay up to $460 in restitution and up to $1,000 in fines. They also must remove any advertisements for tours on national forests within Arizona.</p>
      <p>Officials say Mark Truesdell of Sacred Sites Journey, Georgina Rock of Air B&amp;B; Experience and Kurt Raczynski of Inner Journeys have been banned from the Coconino, Kaibab, Prescott and Apache-Sitgreaves national forests for a year.</p>

        <p>Forest officials say the guides were operating in the Sedona area, skirting fees that help pay for road maintenance, forest employee salaries, supplies and tools.</p>
