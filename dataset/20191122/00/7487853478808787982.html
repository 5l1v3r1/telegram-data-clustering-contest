      <h1>PSG Lining Up Bumper New Deal for Kylian Mbappe to Fend Off Real Madrid Interest</h1>

      <p>​Paris Saint-Germain are preparing to hand Kylian Mbappe a new five-year contract, with the deal set to be worth €30m per year with bonuses.</p>
      <p>The French international is one of the most sought after players in world football having achieved so much already at the age of 20, and has scored 69 goals in just 98 games for PSG.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/real-madrid">​Real Madrid</a> have been long-term admirers of <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/kylian-mbappe">​Mbappe</a> having missed out on his signing when he moved to the Parc des Princes in the summer of 2017, and remain interested in securing his signature at the next available opportunity.</p>
      <p>In a bid to stifle their efforts, <a href="https://twitter.com/NicoSchira/status/1197818144661868544?s=20">​Nicolo Schira</a> of La Gazzetta dello Sport<i> </i>has revealed that the club are in the process of preparing a deal to tie Mbappe down beyond his current contract, which expires in 2022. The terms they are working on are a new five-year deal that would see the Frenchman pocket in the region of €30m every year, with additional bonuses on top.</p>
      <p>Schira also mentions Madrid's interest, but PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi is, understandably, not keen on selling and will hold talks with Mbappe's agent in the near future.</p>

      <p>Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane has reiterated in the last couple of weeks that he believes it's <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6493629-zinedine-zidane-refuses-to-back-down-from-claim-that-kylian-mbappe-dreams-of-real-madrid">​Mbappe's dream to play for Los Blancos</a>, only fuelling speculation over </p>
      <p>With it looking increasingly likely that <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/neymar">​Neymar</a> won't stay beyond his current deal in the capital - and will probably leave even before that - the idea of losing Mbappe to one of<a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/la-liga">​ La Liga</a>'s biggest sides would be a major blow to the club's aspirations of finally winning the <a href="https://www.90min.com/categories/champions-league">​Champions League</a>.</p>
      <p>In the league there are no such concerns however, with Mbappe's eight goal contributions helping Thomas Tuchel's side to a commanding an eight-point lead over nearest challengers Marseille at the Ligue 1 summit.</p>
