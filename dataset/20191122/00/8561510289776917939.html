      <h1>Watch Tesla Accidentally Smash Cybertruck’s “Bulletproof” Window</h1>

      <h3>Windows Smashed</h3>
      <p>Tesla finally <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/tesla-elon-musk-unveils-blade-runner-cybertruck">revealed</a> its outrageous <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/teslas-pickup-truck-blade-runner-elon-musk">“Blade Runner”-style</a> pickup truck, the “cybertruck,” at an event in LA on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>But an on-stage demonstration by Tesla CEO Elon Musk seemingly backfired, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/22/cybertruck-tesla-unveils-the-pickup-truck-we-have-to-have"><i>The Guardian</i> reports</a>: Tesla’s chief designer Franz von Holzhausen lobed a hefty metal ball at the window — and smashed it.</p>
      <p>“Oh my fucking God,” Musk muttered, in apparent chagrin.</p>
      <p>“Maybe that was a little hard,” Von Holzhausen said.</p>
      <p>“It didn’t go through, that’s the plus side,” Musk said, looking as though his soul was leaking out of his body.</p>

      <h3>Impenetrable Exoskeleton</h3>
      <p>The Cybertruck is clad in what Tesla refers to as “ultra-hard 30x cold-rolled stainless steel” on <a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck">its website</a>. The SpaceX-grade material will help “eliminate dents” and ensure “maximum protection” for passengers.</p>
      <p>On stage, Musk promised that the exoskeleton “is literally bulletproof to a 9mm handgun.”</p>
      <h3>Literally Bulletproof</h3>
      <p>We don’t know much about the glass itself. The material is simply referred to as “Tesla armor glass” on the company’s website.</p>
      <p>“Ah, not bad, room for improvement,” Musk joked after the awkward incident.</p>
      <p>And to be fair, there is time to go back to the drawing board: the truck won’t be available until “late 2021” according to Tesla.</p>
