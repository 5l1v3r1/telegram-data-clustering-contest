      <p>Matthews say the bank has so far used bots to process five million transactions in its corporate bank and perform 3.4 million checks within its investment bank.</p>
      <p>As part of its $6.6 billion savings initiative over the next three years, Deutsche Bank announced in July 2019 that it would be cutting 18,000 people from the company over the next three years. <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/10/deutsche-bank-to-focus-on-germany-for-job-cutting-scheme/">Last month it was reported</a> that its home market in Germany would suffer the bulk of the cuts.</p>

      <p>Called Operations 4.0, the German bank is aiming to automate large parts of the institution’s back office so it can streamline processes and redistribute capacity.</p>
      <p>Having already cut 4,700 jobs in the last year, a spokesperson for Deutsche Bank confirmed that about 1,000 were done since the announcement in July.</p>
      <p>The bulk of its equity research department has remained in place, but large swathes of its stocks sales and trading division have not been so lucky.</p>
