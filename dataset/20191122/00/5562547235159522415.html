      <h1>Charges Against DeMarcus Cousins Dropped</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slamonline.com/author/austinkent/" target="_blank">Austin Kent</a></address>
      <p>Third-degree harassment charges against DeMarcus Cousins have been dropped, <a href="https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1197989145999814658">Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN</a> reports. The charges were filed after an alleged dispute between Cousins and the mother of his child over their son appearing at Cousins’ wedding.</p>
      <p>The case, filed in Alabama, has now been dismissed.</p>
      <p>The charges were levied in the weeks following news that Cousins would miss the 2019-20 campaign with a knee injury, not long after inking a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
      <p>We wrote about the initial charges and the <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/nba/arrest-warrant-issued-for-demarcus-cousins/">arrest warrant that had been issued for Cousins</a> back in August.</p>
      <p>The news will clear Cousins to focus on recovering from the torn ACL injury that ruined a potential comeback campaign in Los Angeles following an abbreviated season with the Warriors.</p>
      <p>Cousins signed on for $3.5 million to help LeBron James and Anthony Davis lead the franchise back to the postseason.</p>
      <p>While the Lakers haven’t formally closed the door on the idea of <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/nba/lakers-have-not-closed-the-door-on-demarcus-cousins-returning/">Cousins returning to the court this season</a>, it’s worth noting that the league awarded the team a <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/nba/lakers-granted-disabled-player-exception-for-demarcus-cousins/">disabled player exception for Cousins</a>, which means that a third-party doctor ruled it likely that the big man’s injury would keep him sidelined through mid-June.</p>
