      <p>The Ranking Member on the roads and transport committee in parliament, Kwame Agbodza says there is no documentation or agreement anywhere that shows that the government will buy six planes to run a national airline.</p>
      <p>Mr Agbodzaâ€™s comment comes after the Aviation Minister announced in an interview in Dubai that the country is in talks and inching closer to buying six aircraft to carry the national flag.</p>
      <p>Speaking to JoyBusiness, Kwame Agbodza stated that "if you check the off shelve price for one Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner is about $250 million each and if it's going on a high purchase, that will be over $300 million. I doubt if Ghana government has got such money to undertake such projects now".</p>
      <p>He indicated that government is struggling to settle debts accruing from the facelift and new airport projects undertaken by the previous government hence the claim by Boeing is just a marketing strategy to gain attention to be considered in any eventuality.</p>
      <p>In his words, "there is nothing wrong for us to have a national carrier. Boeing is just trying to up their game because of the loss they faced from their recent plane crash and they are trying to outdo Airbus in terms of getting people to sign-up to buy their aircraft. I can tell you for a fact, there is no agreement anywhere, no documentation anywhere or anything in the budget that shows we're going to buy even a small helicopter for the nation."</p>
      <p>Ghana and Boeing company Tuesday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) at the Dubai Air Show for three aeroplanes with a list price value of $877.5 million according to list prices.</p>
      <p>The move is to help the country fast-track the establishment of the home-based carrier.</p>
