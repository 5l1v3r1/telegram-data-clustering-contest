      <p>Google’s cloud-based printing solution is running low on ink. In an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/dzoxye/google_is_terminating_google_cloud_print/">email</a> sent out to users of Google Cloud Print, Google said the service will no longer be supported as of December 31, 2020. The company encouraged users of the tool to find alternatives before that date, suggesting Chrome OS’s native printing solution or third-party printing apps.</p>
      <p>The company <a href="https://www.popsci.com/gadgets/article/2010-04/google-cloud-print-allow-printing-any-device-any-printer-anywhere/">launched</a> Cloud Print in 2010, in an effort to make it easier to print documents from any Cloud Print-enabled app, like Google Docs, to a network-connected, Cloud-aware printer. Google did note, however, that the feature has technically been in beta since 2010.</p>
      <p>At the time of Cloud Print’s launch, installing a printer to a computer was often considered by many to be a headache, requiring complicated pieces of software or drivers. Even more difficult was connecting a mobile device to a printer. Google Cloud Print aimed to solve that. It even created a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fedex-office-teams-up-with-google-cloud-print/">partnership</a> with FedEx Office in 2012 around the service, which allowed Google Cloud Print users to print documents at any of the chain’s 1,800 U.S. locations.</p>
      <p>Since then, Google has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/10/chrome-os-native-print/">improved</a> Chrome OS’s abilities to natively print documents from the browser to a network printer, skipping the need for a Cloud solution in-between. Some printer manufacturers have also <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c04024231">created</a> their own solutions for users who wish to print from smartphones or tablets.</p>
      <p>I reached out to Google for additional comment and will update the story when I hear back.</p>
