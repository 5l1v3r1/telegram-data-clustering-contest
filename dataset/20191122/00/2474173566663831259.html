      <h1>You Have 14 New Netflix Treats To Binge This Weekend — Here’s What’s Worth Watching</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Ariana Romero</a></address>
      <p>The festive season is officially in full swing <a href="https://refinery29.com/en-gb/netflix">over on Netflix</a>. </p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the streaming service premiered <i><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/vanessa-hudgens-knight-before-christmas-netflix-movie">A Knight Before Christmas</a></i>, the latest in <a href="https://refinery29.com/en-gb/netflix-christmas-films">its now-classic string of endearingly cheesy holiday films</a>, and<i> Holiday Secret</i>, a criminally under-the-radar German miniseries about the lies we tell the ones we love the most (and what happens when the truth comes spilling out on Christmas). Netflix wraps up the week’s yuletide-ready content parade on 22nd November with the debut of <i><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/07/205582/nailed-it-netflix-holiday-announcement">Nailed It! Holiday</a></i>, a series that blends the spirit of the season with <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/06/203086/nailed-it-season-2-baking-highlights-and-best-moments">baking chaos</a>.  </p>
      <p>Still, there’s more to the newest Netflix content dump than holiday programming. We also get a trippy French teen horror series, an anthology series built around<i> Dolly Parton</i>, two wildly glam <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2018/05/198005/best-netflix-foreign-series">international reality shows</a>, a wedding-obsessed standup special from <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/05/152600/truth-iliza-shlesinger-late-night-tv-show-interview">comedian Iliza Shlesinger</a>, a <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/11/8724235/netflix-bikram-documentary-true-story-yoga-cult-rape">yoga documentary </a>adding to the #MeToo discourse, and some more foreign treats. </p>
      <p>How's a winter couch potato supposed to keep track of all this television?</p>
      <p>We’re here to help. These are all the new Netflix offerings broken down by plot, genre, and whether you should watch something immediately or skip for now. Keep reading for the lowdown on all of these Netflix treats and their trailers.</p>

Holiday! </i>is the holiday-specific offshoot of Netflix’s baking fail-based competition series. <br/><br/>This year, mainstay judges Nicole Byer and <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/03/193422/nailed-it-netflix-baking-show-chef-jacques-torres-interview">Jaques Torres</a> will be joined by illustrious guest judges including <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/05/232011/wine-country-netflix-review-amy-poehler-directorial-debut">Maya Rudolph</a>, <a href="https://refinery29.com/en-us/2016/01/102010/jillian-bell-justin-timberlake-story-conan">Jillian Bell</a>, and <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/08/167202/patti-cakes-cast-danielle-macdonald-facebook-live">Bridget Everett</a>. Season 2 also welcomes back <i>Holiday</i>’s very best-ever guest judge, comedian <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/10/8533630/big-mouth-season-3-cast-cameos">Jason Mantzoukas</a>, fresh off of his stint as Giant <i><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/11/8765031/dickinson-apple-tv-plus-season-1-finale-recap-emily-poems">Dickinson</a> </i>Bee on Apple +. <br/><br/><b>See or skip?:</b> See. <i>Nailed It!

You know, the eternal question. From there, much love and holiday cheer is born. <br/><br/><b>See or skip?: </b>See. You’re going to spend 90 minutes of your life watching this film. Please come to terms with that now. I promise, it is much funnier than you expect.</p>

Let’s call it <i>Knight Before Christmas </i>counter-programming.</p>

All of these topics, and more, are explored in <i>Unveiled</i>, Iliza Shlesinger’s first special after getting hitched herself. <br/><br/>While Shlesinger seems to be serving up straight down the middle comedy, she actually slides in some bitingly sharp feminist commentary while everyone is laughing about groomsman and terrible dancing. <br/><br/><b>See or skip?: </b>If you miss the comedic highs of Shlesinger’s 2013 special <i>War Paint, </i>sample <i>Unveiled</i>. </p>
