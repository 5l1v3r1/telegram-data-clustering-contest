        <b>Mauricio Pochettino was sacked by Tottenham on Tuesday but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer does not believe it affects himself or Manchester United.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</b> is not concerned by <b>Mauricio Pochettino's</b> <b>new-found employment status </b>- and conceded any manager would want his Manchester United job.</p>
      <p>Pochettino has been a <b>rumoured target for United for some time</b> and is now available after being sacked by Tottenham on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>With the Red Devils sitting seventh in the Premier League table, nine points adrift of a Champions League spot, Solskjaer could be forgiven for <b>looking nervously over his shoulder</b>, but the Norwegian cut a relaxed figure at his media conference on Friday.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of Sunday's trip to Sheffield United, he said: "It's always sad when <b>one of your colleagues - a good man - loses his job</b> just before Christmas. It's never nice to see. I just wish him all the best."</p>
      <p>"In football <b>you can never be surprised or you can't be shocked at anything</b>. For me, I've just got to focus on us. It doesn’t bother me at all. I've got the best job in the world. I'm sure that if you're in a job or if you're out of a job and you're a manager, you want this job."</p>
      <p>Solskjaer says he has open communication with executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and is <b>confident he will be granted the time and resources to improve</b> United's fortunes.</p>
      <p>He added: "It doesn't really matter [that Pochettino is out of work].<b> I've got to focus on my job at Man United</b>, do it as well as we can. I speak with Ed, I speak with the owners all the time about how we're going to move the club forward. That doesn’t change if some other clubs change their managers."</p>

      <p>"It's about consistency now, and getting as many points on the board as we can," Ole says.</p>

      <p>Pochettino was replaced by former United boss Jose Mourinho, and Solskjaer was <b>pleased to have such an engaging, and controversial, figure</b> back in English football.</p>
      <p>"It's good to have Jose back, definitely - <b>especially for you guys [the media</b>]," he said. "Maybe for me because you can talk and write about everything else."</p>
      <p>Mourinho's arrival in north London prompted suggestions on social media that the Portuguese will <b>immediately target United midfielder Nemanja Matic </b>in January - a player he has worked with previously at Old Trafford and Chelsea.</p>
      <p>Matic even liked one post and replied with laughing and clapping emojis, but Solskjaer, who has previously encouraged his players to be "boring" on Twitter and Instagram, appeared unconcerned.</p>
      <p>He said: "No, that's not a part of being boring. You like Jose coming back. It's going to be a spectacle and a circus. Nemanja has got a sense of humour."</p>
