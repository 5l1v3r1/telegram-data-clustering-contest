      <p>U.S. communications regulators have cut off government funding for equipment from two Chinese companies, citing security threats.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/federal-communications-commission/">Federal Communications Commission</a> also proposed requiring companies that get government subsidies to rip out any equipment from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/zte/">ZTE</a> that they already have in place.</p>
      <p>It’s the latest action by the U.S. government against Chinese tech and telecom companies.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/federal-communications-commission/">FCC</a> voted unanimously Friday to bar U.S. telecommunications providers from using government subsidies to buy equipment from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a> or <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/zte/">ZTE</a>. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/federal-communications-commission/">FCC</a>’s order mostly affects small, rural companies, as larger U.S. carriers do not use equipment from those Chinese companies.</p>
      <p>As for replacing existing equipment, The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/federal-communications-commission/">FCC</a> is asking for comment on how to help rural telecoms financially. Bills in Congress have proposed setting $700 million to $1 billion aside.</p>

      <p>A trade group for small rural wireless carriers has said that it would cost up to $1 billion for its dozen companies to replace their <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/zte/">ZTE</a> equipment. It says that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a> has 40 customers in the U.S. (<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a> is also a member of the trade group, the Rural Wireless Association.)</p>
      <p>The group said Friday that it was “cautiously optimistic” that the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/federal-communications-commission/">FCC</a>’s approach would let its companies keep providing services to customers and give them funding to replace any banned equipment.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a> is the world’s biggest supplier of telecom gear as well as a major cellphone manufacturer. The U.S. government has said that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a> poses an espionage threat, but has presented no evidence of its equipment being used for spying by the Chinese government. The U.S. has been pressuring allies to ban <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a> from their networks and has restricted exports of U.S. technology to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a>, though numerous loopholes have been exploited.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a> said in a statement Friday that the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/federal-communications-commission/">FCC</a> order is unlawful and reiterated that there is no evidence it poses a security risk. The company said it has been deemed a security threat “based on selective information, innuendo, and mistaken assumptions.” It said that the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/federal-communications-commission/">FCC</a>’s actions will hurt connectivity for rural Americans.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/zte/">ZTE</a> did not respond to requests for comment Friday. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/zte/">ZTE</a> has also denied that China uses its products for spying.</p>
        <p>A congressional report in 2012 labeled both Chinese companies as security risks.</p>
        <p>Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/federal-communications-commission/">FCC</a>’s move Friday was a good one, but took too long and did not go far enough. She said there needs to be a “coordinated national plan” for securing next-generation cellular networks, known as 5G.</p>
