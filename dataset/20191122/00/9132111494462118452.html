      <p>The ferry transporting passengers and their goods on the River Oti to Accra has broken down at Dambai, the capital of Oti region.</p>
      <p>It is said to have developed an engine fault leading to growing frustration among dozens of passengers including traders and drivers of vehicles, it was ferrying.</p>
      <p>Adom News Mubarak Yakubu reports that, some of the passengers spent the Thursday night in Dambai thinking the ferry could be repaired.</p>
      <p>According to them, the road leading to Northern region through the eastern corridor is blocked for construction works so their only option is to use the ferry from Dambai.</p>
      <p>They say their choice is either to wait for the broken down ferry to be fixed or risk travelling on engine boats without life jackets.</p>
      <p>However, they have been stranded and call on government to either change the ferry or get a bridge on the river to aid the movement of commuters and goods.</p>
