      <p>Tokyo - The NYK Group makes <b>a step towards autonomous ships</b>. The shipping group has concluded a joint research agreement for developing advanced condition-based maintenance, CBM, a new maintenance and management process for ship machineries, and has started verification during actual ship operation. Machinery plant data from many sensors will be shared and monitored with the classification society and engine manufacturers in real time, thus advancing maintenance management. In the future, the NYK Group use this data and real-time monitoring to develop an advanced CBM to realize manned autonomous vessels.</p>
      <p>In the shipping industry, <b>time-based maintenance (TBM) is usually practiced</b>, but TBM requires a vessel to halt operations for a few weeks of inspections every two or three years even if no fatigue or breakdown of the engine is observed. Moreover, unexpected failures can occur during voyages and cause long delays. In accordance with recent developments in information and communication technology, large amounts of data can be transmitted between ship and shore. The <b>NYK Group has utilized these advancements to focus on CBM</b> and conduct research on optimal maintenance. NYK has now decided to boost its research by partnering with the companies indicated below to develop advanced CBM.</p>
