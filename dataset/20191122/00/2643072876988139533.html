      <p>Delivering judgment in the case filed by the <b>All Progressives Congress</b> (APC) and its candidate <b>Alhaji Ahmed Aliyu Sokoto</b>, the appellate court dismissed the case for lack of merit.</p>
      <p><b>Justice Hussein Muktar</b> who presided over the case and also read the lead judgment, disclosed that the ruling is a unanimous decision of the four-man panel of the court.</p>
      <p>It ruled that the appellant had failed to prove the allegations of over-voting.</p>
      <p>With the ruling on Friday, the election of Governor Aminu Tambuwal as the duly elected governor of Sokoto State has been affirmed by the appeal court.</p>
      <p>Previously, the Sokoto State Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, had affirmed the election of Governor Aminu Tambuwal of the <b>Peoples Democratic Party</b> (PDP).</p>
