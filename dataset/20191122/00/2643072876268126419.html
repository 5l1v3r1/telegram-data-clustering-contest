      <p>Hundreds of thousands of faulty condoms on sale in Uganda have been recalled by the Global health charity Marie Stopes.</p>
      <p>The recall followed a warning from Uganda’s National Drug Authority that the Life Guard brand condoms had failed manufacturing <i>“quality tests”</i> as they contained holes and may burst while in use.</p>
      <p>According to the government regulator, the affected condoms were manufactured by India-based MHL Healthcare in April 2019 and would expire by April 2024.</p>
      <p>Marie Stopes Uganda spokesman, David Kamu said the two affected batches each contained<i> “around 400,000”</i> condoms.</p>
      <p>Marie Stopes Uganda said more than half of the affected condoms had been recalled.</p>
      <p><i>“While the LifeGuard brand follows strict quality controls, unfortunately two recent batches have fallen short of the quality we demand,</i>” the charity’s country director, Carole Sekimpi, made known in a statement.</p>
