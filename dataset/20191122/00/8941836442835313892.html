      <h1>Joe Biden blasts Fox News’ Peter Doocy for question about son</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/jessica-chasmar/" target="_blank">Jessica Chasmar</a></address>
      <p>Democratic presidential candidate <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joseph-r-biden/">Joseph R. Biden</a> on Thursday blasted Fox News reporter Peter Doocy for asking him to weigh in on the report that his son Hunter <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joseph-r-biden/">Biden</a> is confirmed to be the biological father of a child in Arkansas.</p>
      <p>“I’m wondering if you have a comment on this report and court filing out of Arkansas that your son Hunter just made you a grandfather again,” Mr. Doocy <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/joe-biden-peter-doocy-hunter-biden-dna-test">asked</a> the former vice president.</p>
      <p>“No, that’s a private matter and I have no comment,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joseph-r-biden/">Mr. Biden</a> fired back. “But only you would ask that. You’re a good man. You’re a good man.”</p>
      <p>“Classy,” he said before turning to the next reporter’s question.</p>
      <p>CNN <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/20/politics/hunter-biden-dna-test/index.html">reported</a> Thursday that a DNA test “established with scientific certainty” that Hunter <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joseph-r-biden/">Biden</a> fathered a baby with 28-year-old Lunden Alexis Roberts, according to a motion filed in Arkansas on Wednesday by Ms. Roberts.</p>

      <p>Hunter <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joseph-r-biden/">Biden</a>, who previously denied having sex with the woman, “is not expected to challenge the results of the DNA test or the testing process,” the filing said.</p>

        <p>The news comes amid heightened scrutiny over Hunter <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joseph-r-biden/">Biden</a>’s business dealings in Ukraine — a key detail in the ongoing impeachment inquiry of President Trump.</p>
