      <h1>Notre Dame beats Toledo 64-62 in OT behind Gibbs, Pflueger</h1>

      <p>SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) - Notre Dame appeared “dead in the water like seven times,” according to coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-brey/">Mike Brey</a>, yet T.J. Gibbs and Rex Pflueger kept finding ways to resuscitate the Fighting Irish during their improbable 64-62 overtime victory over <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toledo/">Toledo</a> on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Gibbs made two steals in the final 35 seconds of the extra period and assisted <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pflueger/">Pflueger</a> on the backdoor, go-ahead basket with 25 seconds left.</p>
      <p>The Irish had already rallied from a 52-45 deficit in the final three minutes of regulation, capped by sophomore sub Nate Laszewski’s right-wing 3-pointer at the horn. It came off an inbound from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pflueger/">Pflueger</a> with 1.5 seconds to play.</p>
      <p>Gibbs’ first steal in OT led to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pflueger/">Pflueger</a>’s basket and a 60-59 Irish lead. He followed with another steal and added two free throws for a 62-59 count.</p>
      <p>“It was just out of our motion,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-brey/">Brey</a> said of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pflueger/">Pflueger</a>’s game-winner. “It was not a called play. I think (it was) two senior guards just connecting and communicating.</p>

      <hr/>
      <p>“And how about Rex Pflueger?” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-brey/">Brey</a> continued. “I could care less about his shooting (2 of 10 from the field). He makes every play, big play, clutch play. Such a winner.”</p>
      <p>A missed 3-pointer by the Rockets’ Willie Jackson with four seconds left in OT led to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pflueger/">Pflueger</a> hitting two free throws at 1.1 showing to clinch the game.</p>
      <p>More maddening for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toledo/">Toledo</a> coach Tod Kowalczyk than overtime was the end of regulation.</p>
      <p>“Really ticked (we) didn’t cover the inbound play on Nate Laszewski’s 3-pointer,” Kowalczyk said.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>“I gotta be honest,” he added. “That one hurts. We gave it away. I thought we were the better team.”</p>
        <p>The Irish (5-1) won their fifth straight overall in what was effectively the title contest of the five-team, round-robin Men Against Breast Cancer Invitational.</p>
        <p>Sophomore Dane Goodwin led Notre Dame with 16 points, 14 coming after halftime.</p>
        <p>Gibbs scored 11 points, Laszewski tallied 10 and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pflueger/">Pflueger</a> snatched a career-high six steals.</p>
        <p>Irish star John Mooney, in his return from a stomach virus that kept him out of Monday’s win, netted a season-low seven points on 3 of 11 from the field and 1 of 5 at the line, but added 15 rebounds.</p>
        <p>Marreon Jackson poured in 23 points for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toledo/">Toledo</a> (3-2), while Jackson added 20 rebounds to go with 11 points. Chris Knapke scored 16 points for the Rockets.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toledo/">Toledo</a>: A potentially resume-building win for the Rockets went by the wayside. They’ll have precious few of those opportunities over the rest of their schedule.</p>
        <p>Notre Dame: The Irish continued to build steam heading closer to their Dec. 4 visit to No. 6 Maryland. They also have matchups next month with UCLA and Indiana, both undefeated entering Thursday.</p>
        <p>TRIPLE TROUBLE</p>
        <p>The Rockets paid for an uncharacteristically poor shooting effort from outside the arc.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toledo/">Toledo</a> entered the night second in the nation in 3-point accuracy at 47.3%, on 43 of 91, but hit just 6 of 27 for 22%.</p>
        <p>The Irish were just as bad, going 8 of 35 for 23%.</p>
        <p>Notre Dame also landed at just 31.5% from the field overall, while <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toledo/">Toledo</a> closed at 35%, and the teams combined for just 18 of 30 from the line for 60%.</p>
        <p>“I think the law of averages will kick in,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-brey/">Brey</a> said. “I’ll say this, we had some good looks. I thought we settled for some shots instead of driving it some when we could’ve.”</p>
        <p>PROMISE MADE</p>
        <p>Marreon Jackson was admittedly seething after his team’s loss.</p>
        <p>“We’re gonna look back on this game the rest of the season,” Jackson said, “because that will never happen again.”</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toledo/">Toledo</a>: The Rockets host NAIA program Northwestern Ohio (2-5) on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Notre Dame: The Irish welcome Fairleigh Dickinson on Tuesday in the last of six straight home games.</p>
