      <p>Member of Parliament (MP) for Keta constituency in the Volta Region, Hon. Richard Quarshiga has blasted the Akufo-Addo led government for poor inaccurate economic records listed by the government’s economic management team and said the economy has rather been drawn back in the last two years.</p>
      <p>According to him, the economic hardship Ghanaians are enduring is a fact nobody can deny.</p>
      <p>He said the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) has lost focus and abusing their office.</p>
      <p>Richard Quarshiga in an interview with Kwame Tutu on Accra based Kingdom 107.7 FM said” Ghana’s economy is in limbo and nothing is going well, high rate of unemployment. President Akufo-Addo has failed to deliver his promises concerning the economy.”</p>
      <p>r. Quarshiga has also urged the NPP government to make good its numerous 2016 campaign promises.</p>
      <p>He said Ghanaians are living the experience of bad governance under the NPP and due to that economic hardship has increased.</p>
      <p>To him, the NPP has no sense of priority and the reason for which Ghanaians voted for them has been left to the dogs with everything upside down.</p>
      <p>Mr. Quarshiga said President Akufo-Addo’s bad governance has worsened the plight of the ordinary Ghanaian.</p>
      <p>The law maker wild claim is likely to trigger heated political debate because he stands accused of supervising a very weak economy that brought untold hardships to the people.</p>
