      <p>Do you know someone who gets "hangry?" You know that irritable feeling you get when you are overly hungry. Or, maybe you know someone who struggles more with what I call, "regret<i>full</i>" --that icky grumpiness that happens when you are too full.</p>

      <p>Both sides of coin--eating too little or too much have a strong impact on how you feel and in turn on how you act. When in the throes of "hanger" or "regret<i>full</i>ness," research shows that it's hard to concentrate, think clearly and be patient with others.*</p>
      <p>Despite our best efforts to eat well, it's often not as easy as it sounds. In my new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hanger-Management-Master-Improve-Relationships/dp/0316524565/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia?keywords=hanger+management&amp;pd_rd_i=0316524565&amp;pd_rd_r=8a5456f4-db5f-4655-b259-93670fbb92df&amp;pd_rd_w=ue0sr&amp;pd_rd_wg=QEOiZ&amp;pf_rd_p=1cb3f32a-ccfd-479b-8a13-b22f56c942c6&amp;pf_rd_r=K29YA19YVCEHMMS6WX0W&amp;psc=1&amp;qid=1574165859"><i>Hanger Management</i></a>, I reveal 10 of the most common reasons people slip into a state of hanger or regret<i>full</i>ness.</p>
      <p><b>1. Too Busy to Eat</b> (Don’t have time, other things take priority)</p>
      <p><b>2. No Routine</b> (No set eating schedule)</p>
      <p><b>3. Too Much Effort</b> (It takes too much energy to cook, plan meals and make decisions)</p>
      <p><b>4. Dieting</b> (<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-harm">Cutting</a> back or restricting food)</p>
      <p><b>5. Mindless Eating</b> (Picking and snacking, but few real meals)</p>
      <p><b>6. Empty Calorie Eater</b> (Eating food that is not filling)</p>
      <p><b>7. Indecisive</b> (Confused by <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/diet">nutrition</a> information or what is truly healthy to eat)</p>
      <p><b>8. Hungry All the Time</b> (Difficulty decoding body cues, feeling hungry constantly)</p>
      <p><b>9. Social Eater</b> (Eat well with others, harder when eating alone)</p>
      <p><b>10. Too <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">Stressed</a> Out </b>(Feeling overwhelmed, don’t have the mental energy, emotional eating)</p>
      <p>In working with hundred of people over the years on emotional eating, intuitive eating and mindful eating, I've learned a very powerful truth. <i>What you eat impacts how you feel and how you feel impacts what you eat</i>. While the relationship is strong, it's often difficult to navigate the path between them. The ability to understand hunger cues can easily get skewed or confusing in a world that pushes dieting but sets up a mindless eating environment. The good news is that you can reset that ability!
