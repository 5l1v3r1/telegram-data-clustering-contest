      <p>GRACIOUS David-West, who is being prosecuted for allegedly killing women in hotel rooms across the country, including Rivers State, after being intimate with them, has pleded not guilty to the crime.</p>
      <p>A month ago when he was first arraigned in court before Justice Adolphus Enebeli, David-West confessed killing nine of the women but denied killing the 10th, saying he only tied her up and walked away after warning her to desist from prostitution.</p>
      <p>At a resumed sitting, Justice Enebeli ordered the second suspect, Mimi ThankGod to be charged with David-West.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, when the amended charge was read out to the duo,  they pled not guilty.</p>
      <p>The  prime suspect is facing a 10-count charge bordering on murder, but Mrs. ThankGod, a manager of one of the hotels where the killings allegedly took place, is facing a two-count charge of God was charged with ill conduct with one of the victim’s bodies.</p>
      <p>ThankGod was granted bail in the sum of N500,000.</p>
      <p>Mrs. ThankGod’s lawyer Edward Obiokor reminded the court that his client was charged for misconduct with the body, not murder, adding that she even helped to rescue one of the victims who the prime suspect attempted to murder in the same hotel.</p>
      <p>In an interview with repoters shortly  after the sitting, the principal prosection officer of the Ministry  of Justice, who represented the Attorney General yesterday, Chidi  Ekeh, said: “David-West was arraigned before this same court for the killing of nine young women in the state, he pleaded guilty to nine of the 10 charges given to him.</p>
      <p>“Today, he has changed his guilty plea to not guilty. However, his guilty plea did not make any difference because the court will still write not guilty for him, because he is charged with capital offence.</p>
      <p>“Again, the second person that was arraigned with him is not being tried for murder, but for misconduct with corpse. She is a manager of one of the hotels (a guest house), the crime was committed and the corpse hidden under the bed.</p>
      <p>“When the dead body was discovered apprently by a house keeper  and reported to her, instead of her to alert the police or any authority about the strange corpse, directed that the body be wrapped in a black polyethylene bag and thrown into a refuse dump in the area.”</p>

      <p>He noted that prosecution discovered this event in the police investigation file, but was surprised that they did not charge her to court, prompting the office of the Attorney-General of th state, Prof. Zaccheus Adango to insist that she be charged for the ill treatment to the corpse.</p>
      <p>“So it is necessary that she appears before the court to explain the reason for such action they took,” he said.</p>
      <p>The court adjourned the case to   December 9, 11,  13, 16,  18,  19 and 20 for hearing.</p>
      <p>Trial judge Adolphus Enebeli promised to adjourn all other cases before hin in each of these days to ensure speedy justice delivery of the charge.</p>
      <p>David-West, through his lawyer  Vincent Chuku, urged the court to order police to release his money, wristwatch and neckless impounded when they arrested him in August.</p>
      <p>The court assured him that they would be recovered but that they should be more concerned with the matter and the magnitude of the murder charge against him.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the police have raised concerns that the remains of some of the David-West’s victims are still in the morgue with nobody coming to claim them.</p>
