      <h1>INEC Announces Date For Kogi Supplementary Election, Re-run</h1>
      <h2>A court had earlier declared the election conducted in the state as null and void while ordering the INEC to conduct a new election for the office.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">SaharaReporters, New York</a></address>
      <p>The commission in a statement said, "INEC met on November 21, 2019 and fixed November 30, 2019 for the conduct of supplementary and re-run elections for Kogi West Senatorial District and Ajaokuta Federal Constituency respectively."</p>
      <p>A court had earlier declared the election conducted in the state as null and void while ordering the INEC to conduct a new election for the office. <br/>Dino Melaye, winner of the previous election, lost in the latest one, describing the results as “magic”.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, SaharaReporters had earlier reported that Senator Melaye, during a press conference in Abuja, had earlier accused Smart Adeyemi and Governor Yahaya Bello of using violence, intimidation and inducement to frustrate the electorate in areas where he was popular.</p>
      <p>He said, “Three people were shot and two died; four people were killed in Lokoja; seven were killed in the eastern part of the state; this is the record we have so far, apart from those who sustained gunshot wounds."</p>
      <p>Melaye further alleged that the results of Iyara, Adeyemi’s hometown, were written while mayhem was unleashed on his hometown of Aiyetoro-Gbede, which claimed the life of his nephew, Olajuwon.</p>
      <p>He added, “We are waiting to see what INEC will do. </p>
      <p>"But I reject in totality these fictitious results. </p>
      <p>"I, Dino Melaye, won that election in the afternoon and the APC won it at night.”<br/> </p>
