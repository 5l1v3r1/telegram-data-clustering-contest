      <p>It's fifth against first in Serie A on Saturday, as Atalanta welcome Juventus to the Atleti Azzurri d'Italia. </p>
      <p>The home side had looked in good shape to challenge the top two in Italy this season. However, they have fallen off the pace in recent weeks, and are without a league win since their record 7-1 win over Udinese.</p>
      <p>Atalanta find themselves 10 points behind Saturday's opponents <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/juve">​Juventus</a>, who are still unbeaten in the league this season. </p>

      <p>Juventus have an excellent record against Atalanta, with their last defeat against them in Serie A coming back in February 2001. Since then, the Bianconeri have won 75 points out of 87 against the Nerazzurri (W23, D6).</p>
      <p>Juventus have beaten Atalanta on 64 occasions in Serie A – more than any other side.​</p>
      <p>The Old Lady have scored in each of their last 20 away games against Atalanta in Serie A, last failing to do so in September 1991 (0-0) – this is the longest such streak for the Bianconeri against an opponent in Serie A.</p>

      <p>Both teams are enjoying fine starts to the Serie A campaign. Atalanta have won 22 points from their opening 12 Serie A games this season: their highest tally at this stage of the competition.​</p>
      <p>Likewise, Juventus have won 32 points from their first 12 games. Only in 2005/06 (33) and in 2018/19 (34) have they won more points at this stage of the competition.</p>

      <p>Juventus love an edgy one goal lead. This season, they have won more games by a one goal margin than any other side across the top five European Leagues (nine).​</p>
      <p>The stats all point to Saturday's game being a classic 1-0; Juventus have not conceded a Serie A goal this November, while Atalanta are yet to score one. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Atalanta's goalscoring record this season is massively influenced by the presence of Duván Zapata. Atalanta have averaged three goals every 90 minutes with the Colombian striker on the pitch, compared to just 1.8 goals per 90 minutes without him.​</p>
