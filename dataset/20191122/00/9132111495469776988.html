      <p>The President of the GaDangme Council of Wulom?i (Chief Priests), Numo Blafo III, has said the construction of a national shrine is not feasible since traditional worshippers have different forms of worship.</p>
      <p>According to him, although they are all referred to as traditionalists, it would be difficult to have all of them under one roof.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know how a national shrine is going to be like because we traditionalists have different ways of worship though we are all traditionalists. For example, a Tigare [a deity] worshipper will not be comfortable at the same place with somebody who is worshipping something else,” he said in an interview on Accra-based radio station, Citi FM.</p>
      <p>The Minister of Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, Mr Samuel Kofi Dzamesi, on Wednesday, said at a press briefing that the government has received requests to build a national shrine for traditional leaders and that the request was being studied since it would not be out of place.</p>
      <p>According to Mr Dzamesi, following plans for the construction of a national cathedral and an already existing national mosque, he has received requests from a group of Wulom?i [Ga Traditional Priests] for a traditional shrine.</p>
      <p>But Numo Blafo said he was hearing of the request and plans for the first time.</p>
      <p>“Well, I’m only hearing about it. I think this needs to be interrogated properly because we are talking about a shrine,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t have an idea how a national shrine is going to be like and what exactly will go into the construction of a national shrine. Though we are all traditionalists, we have our ways and the forms through which we go about our activities."</p>
      <p>"So that is what I’m trying to comprehend as to how it’s going to be like...[maybe] it will be a consensus where we say ok, annually, we will meet here as in a convention and offer sacrifices...I don’t know,” he said.</p>
