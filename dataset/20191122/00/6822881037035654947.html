        <b>Spain’s CaixaBank has signed an agreement with Salesforce to develop innovation projects which fuse customer relationship management (CRM) with the digital transformation phase taking hold of banking.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The two announced their partnership in San Francisco at Salesforce’s Dreamforce event, where CaixaBank’s digital business executive president Jordi Nicolau, and chief information officer (CIO) Pere Nebot, met co-CEO of Salesforce Keith Block, to finalise the plan.</p>

      <p>As part of CaixaBank’s 2019-2020 strategic plan, employees will be able to use these co-developed CRM tools to respond to the bank’s customers. Salesforce will also become a member of the ‘la Caixa’ banking foundation which helps people struggling to integrate in the labour market.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the agreement reads that CaixaBank – now holding 15.6 million customers – will be included in Salesforce’s international research and development (R&amp;D) programme for financial services, which compromises of “a small group of banks experimenting with new ways of approaching customers”.</p>
