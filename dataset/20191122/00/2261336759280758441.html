      <p>Lightweight contenders Josh Thomson and Gilbert Melendez already faced each other thrice inside a mixed martial arts cage. All three fights happened in the now defunct Strikeforce promotion, with “El Niño” winning two of those contests via decision.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old Thomson is currently signed with Bellator, and hasn’t fought since 2017 when he lost to Patricky “Pitbull” via second round knockout. If he does return to action, he wants a fourth fight against Melendez inside the Bellator cage.</p>
      <p>“This would not be like a money fight. This would be more of a situation where the two of us feel like there’s unsettled business,” Thomson said in his YouTube channel (transcript by <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/josh-thomson-gilbert-melendez-tetralogy-bellator-unsettled-business">MMA Junkie</a>). “I won the first fight hands down, convincing. He won the second fight, hands down, convincingly.</p>
      <p>“The third fight was a split decision loss. It was very controversial. As he was leaving the cage, people were booing. People were throwing things.</p>
      <p>“As we walked down the tunnel (backstage) – I felt this was extremely inappropriate – people started spitting at them as they were leaving the arena. If you go back and watch that fight, I obviously felt like I won; he obviously felt like he won.”</p>
      <p>Thomson sees a possible fight as an opportunity that would benefit both him and Melendez in some way.</p>
      <p>“We spent 75 minutes in the cage. Every time it was for the title,” Thomson said. “This time it’s not for the title. This time is a three-round fight. Bellator doesn’t do five-round main event fights. This is a good opportunity for the two of us.</p>
      <p>“We know that we’re not what we used to be. There’s no doubt about that. There’s no denying that. But we both feel like there’s unsettled business.”</p>
      <p>Melendez went on a five-fight losing streak in the UFC spanning from 2014. He was <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/11/20960265/ufc-releases-former-strikeforce-champion-gilbert-melendez-mma-news">released from the roster</a> last week after a six-year run, compiling a 1-6 record with the company.</p>
