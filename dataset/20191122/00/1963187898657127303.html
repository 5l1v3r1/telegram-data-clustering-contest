      <p>CAIRO –22 November 2019: Ivorian manager, Soualiho Haidara, is already a hero in his country after leading Ivory Coast to the Olympic Games for the second time in the nation’s history. <br/><br/>However, the local manager aims to lead his players to achieve their first title in the competition’s history and add more joy to that they already celebrated. <br/><br/>“This is our fifth game in two weeks and this is a massive effort. The absent players won’t affect my team and any 11 who will play will do the job.” The manager said before the game. <br/><br/>Ivory Coast played in Group B alongside Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia and they finished the group top after gaining 6 points from two victories over Nigeria and Zambia while their only loss came against South Africa. <br/><br/>Haidara added “Egypt is a great team and we respect them much, but we will give them a fight for the cup.” <br/><br/>Ivory Coast’s only appearance at the Olympics was in 2008 in Beijing when they reached the quarter finals before losing to Nigeria who clinched the silver medal.</p>
