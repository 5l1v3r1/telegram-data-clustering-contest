      <h1>West Ham-Tottennham and Pellegrini-Mourinho: Let the show commence!</h1>

        <b>The Portuguese Jose Mourinho is back in action this Saturday with his new team, Tottenham, against West Ham, with the added morbidity that the rival coach will be Chilean, Manuel Pellegrini, who he replaced at Real Madrid in 2010.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Almost a year after being sacked from Manchester Untied, the Portuguese coach <b>returns to the Premier League. </b>He will do so with his third English club after managing Chelsea, twice, and Manchester United, with the obligation of improving Spurs,<b> who were runners-up in last year's Champions League.</b></p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino made the North London team grow, but he<b> failed to finish off the good work with a title. </b>The difficult start to the season cost the Argentine his job. Daniel Levy hired Jose Mourinho to lead the Premier League team, despite him <b>not having very much success in the last stages of his managing career.</b></p>

      <p>And just by chance it is that his first game is against Pellegrini's West Ham, with who the relationship<b> has not exactly been good</b> and even the Portuguese went as far as saying that Pellegrini would not even coach at Malaga<b> if he got sacked from Real Madrid.</b> The Chilean coach stated that Mourinho is not his friend, but not his enemy. </p>
      <p>In any case, both teams need a win at the Olympic stadium. <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> have not won <b>since September </b>and are fourteenth with 14 points, just one more than <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/west-ham-united/">West Ham</a>, who are sixteenth and<b> whose last win dates back to the same month.</b></p>
      <p>Mourinho admitted that <b>he will barely be able to change anything </b>after two training sessions, so he will trust in the work that was done by the previous coach. He will only be able to<b> change the mood of his players, </b>some of whom are returning from their national team commitments, where, like Harry Kane, they have excelled, although in <b>a derby there is no need to increase motivation.</b></p>
