      <h1>After Looting U.S. Pensions, Private Equity Promises To Save Struggling U.K. Pensions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Edward Siedle</a></address>
      <p>Private equity firms claim to have found a way for U.K. businesses to keep the promises they made to the 11 million participants in their pension plans, many of which are under-funded. The firms claim to be able to achieve higher returns with lower costs, greater stability and less risk.  That’s more than a little ironic given in recent decades the PE industry has been accused of looting America’s pensions—particularly state and local government pensions— with their uber-costly, high-risk, secretive, under-performing investment funds and of breaking pension promises made to employees of companies the firms have bought. </p>
      <p>Private equity has lost its luster this side of the pond, as the so-called solutions to America’s underfunded pensions the industry touted have failed to materialize. Struggling U.S. pensions that paid handsomely to gamble on PE funds are no better off. On the other hand, PE titans who made tens of billions off of American workers’ retirement funds are a whole lot wealthier.   </p>
      <p>Democratic Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren’s “<a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2019.7.17%20Stop%20Wall%20Street%20Looting%20Act%20Text.pdf">Stop Wall Street Looting Act of 2019</a>” is designed to end what she calls "legalized looting" by “vampire” investment firms that take over troubled companies. Warren wants to make private equity firms responsible for debts and pension obligations of companies they buy.</p>
      <p>Honor pension promises made, says Warren.</p>
      <p>Warren comes late to the fight against private equity abuses.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-07/bogus-private-equity-fees-said-found-at-200-firms-by-sec">2014 internal review</a> by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found that more than half of approximately 400 private-equity firms the SEC examined charged unjustified fees and expenses<i> </i>without notifying investors. In other words, America’s premier financial regulator determined that charging “bogus” fees is commonplace in the private equity industry—in addition to the outrageous fees the industry charges.</p>
      <p>My 2012, 2013 and 2014 unprecedented forensic investigations of the $14 billion <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2112594">Kentucky</a>, $7 billion <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/805888/rhode-island-public-pension-reform-investigation.pdf">Rhode Island</a> and $90 billion <a href="https://www.seanc.org/assets/SEANC_Pension_Investigation_Highlights__Recommendations.pdf">North Carolina </a>state pensions, revealed massive undisclosed fees and widespread corrupt private equity practices.</p>
      <p>Legendary investor Warren Buffett recently criticized both private equity lavish fees and industry integrity:</p>
      <p>“It's a lopsided system whereby 2% of your principal is paid each year to the manager even if he accomplishes nothing— or, for that matter, loses you a bundle— and additionally 20% of your profit is paid to him if he succeeds."</p>
      <p>That’s hardly endorsement of private equity investment results.</p>
      <p>Buffett also said he found that private equity funds often calculate their investment performance in a manner that’s not “honest.”</p>
      <p>So, in addition to charging unreasonable fees, private equity firms routinely lie about—inflate—their investment performance, says the Oracle of Omaha.</p>
      <p>In the U.K., private equity firms are backing so-called “superfunds” that are seeking to enter the business of taking over pension funds from companies struggling to keep them going. To date, insurers have dominated the market.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-19/private-equity-muscles-into-britain-s-booming-retirement-market">Bloomberg,</a> “U.K. “superfunds” are awaiting approval of their debut deals from a regulator that’s pushing for consolidation.” Since they don’t face the costly capital requirements imposed on insurers, private equity firms submit they can consolidate and manage pension plans at lower cost and generate better returns.</p>
      <p>Will the U.K government buy PE’s disingenuous, self-serving argument that lack of regulation—evading those pesky capital requirements—is a “positive?” I sure hope not. As a former regulator, I can assure you that there are colossal risks related to allowing so-called superfunds without new regulations to protect retirees from the heightened dangers posed by PE.</p>
      <p>The U.K. government should also be aware that across America, PE firms have systematically eviscerated state and local access to public records laws (often referred to as “Freedom of Information Acts”), claiming that lack of transparency regarding these speculative investments is also a “positive.” It is well-documented that from sea to shining sea the industry has successfully lobbied for “trade secret” protection to thwart public scrutiny in America.   </p>
      <p>Whenever PE is entrusted with workers’ retirement assets, transparency plummets. Count on it.</p>
      <p>If you are a participant in a UK pension, this expert in pension forensics would advise you to be very concerned. When PE muscles into pensions, promises made are less likely to be kept. </p>
