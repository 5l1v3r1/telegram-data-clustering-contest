      <p>Uber is in talks with Bengaluru-based bike rental startup Bounce to list its two-wheelers on the Uber India app, sources told <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/start-ups/uber-hopes-for-a-bounce-in-two-wheelers-11574362745147.html">Mint</a>. This comes at a time when the ride-hailing giant is eyeing an expansion in this domestic segment.</p>
      <p>Of late, Uber has been looking to venture beyond four-wheelers to increase commute options on its app. Bounce thus comes into the picture as it provides two-wheelers that can be picked-up and dropped anywhere within the city by customers.</p>
      <p>A source told the paper that talks are underway and a pilot service will be launched in Bengaluru without any financial agreements. Earlier in May, Uber launched a similar pilot in the city with micro-mobility platform service Yulu.</p>
      <p>In October, Uber tied up with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to offer public transport and real-time information to commuters through its app. The launch, which sought to plug last-mile connectivity gap in the metro network, made Delhi the second city in the Asia-Pacific region to allow commuters to plan their journey and transit through the Uber app.</p>

      <p>The US-based ride hailing company <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/uber-unveils-driver-rewards-programme-in-13-indian-cities-4658621.html">announced </a>on November 20 that it has rolled out Uber Plus, a driver rewards programme, in 13 Indian cities including Delhi-NCR, Chandigarh, Kochi and Guwahati.</p>
      <p>Uber has also invested Rs 1,767 crore (around $250 million) in its India business, further committing to a market where it is going up against local startups across a range of sectors. The money, a <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/uber-strengthens-india-push-with-250-million-investment-4630991.html">source told Moneycontrol</a>, will be deployed in the ride-hailing business, where the company sees Ola as its main rival.</p>
