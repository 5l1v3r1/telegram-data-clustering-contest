        <b>U2 HAS released a brand-new song to mark the band’s first ever visit to India.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ahimsa – the Sanskrit word for non-violence – is the result of a new collaboration with legendary composer A.R. Rahman.</p>
      <p>Available to stream now on all platforms the band says collaboratio “celebrates the spiritual diversity of India” and comes less than one month ahead of the arrival of The Joshua Tree Tour in Mumbai on 15 December 2019.</p>
      <p>U2 guitarist The Edge said: “India has been on our bucket list for a very long time, the principles of ahimsa or non-violence have served as an important pillar of what our band stands for since we first came together to play music.</p>
      <p>“We can’t wait to experience the culture of India first hand, a place that brings together the modern and the ancient all at once.”</p>

      <p>“Martin Luther King said ‘The moral arc of the universe is long but it bends towards justice….’. I don’t believe that any more… It doesn’t bend towards justice, it has to be bent towards justice.</p>
      <p>“We have to be actively involved in our democracy to preserve it and show people how we feel and what we care about…</p>
      <p>“We come as students to the source of inspiration… That is ahimsa… non-violence... India gave this to us… the greatest gift to the world… It is more powerful than nuclear energy, the armies, the navies, the British Empire. It is power itself. And it’s never been more important.”</p>
      <p>2019 is also set to  see the release of four highlights from U2’s extensive catalogue of songs, remixed by local Indian artists, coming soon on all streaming platforms.</p>
