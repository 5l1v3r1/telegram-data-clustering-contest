      <p>Today’s the day that <a href="https://www.tmonews.com/2019/11/t-mobile-magenta-friday-deals-iphone-11-pixel-4-oneplus-7t/">T-Mobile’s Magenta Friday deals</a> go live, but those aren’t the only new offers that T-Mo has rolled out.</p>

      <p>While the iPhone XS and XS Max aren’t the latest Apple flagships, they’re still well-specced devices that ought to serve most everyone well for a while. Plus, getting $500 off the 512GB version of the iPhone XS is a pretty nice deal for anyone who wants to carry a ton of music, videos, or games everywhere they go.</p>
      <p>And then there’s the Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL, which are affordable ways to get the high-quality camera found in the Pixel 3 as well as guaranteed updates through May 2022.</p>
      <p>Are you thinking about jumping on any of these deals?</p>
