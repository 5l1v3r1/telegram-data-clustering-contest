      <p>NFP Leader Professor Biman Prasad has claimed that the total debt for Government as of July 2020 is projected to be around $6.18 billion.</p>
      <p>While speaking in parliament, Professor Prasad says in 2007 Fiji’s Gross Domestic Product stood at $5.447 billion and for the 2019 financial year, the value of GDP is $11.282 billion – 108% increase in GDP.</p>
      <p>He says in 2007 Fiji’s total debt levels was $2.734 billion.</p>
      <p>Professor Prasad says if Government fulfils its borrowing obligations of $1.019 billion under the 2019-2020 budget, as well as meets the projected loan repayment of more than $617 million, the total debt as of July 2020 is projected to be around $6.18 billion.</p>
      <p>He adds this means debt levels increasing by 120% over the same corresponding period.</p>
      <p>He says this means borrowing $3.446 billion in 13 years to increase GDP by $5.835 billion adding this would mean that the current Government borrowed $3.446 billion to increase GDP only to see the economy starting to strangulate.</p>
      <p>Professor Prasad further says they can safely say that the GDP has been inflated to maximise borrowing to unprecedented levels.</p>
      <p>He says he is afraid this is going to be unsustainable and all this government is doing is bequeathing a debt-laden nation to our future generations just to show a consumption-driven economy that is now grinding to a halt.</p>
