      <p><b>Update, November 22</b>: Green Man Gaming is currently offering Red Dead Redemption 2 for <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7706533/type/dlg/sid/pcg-1178837400631159552/https://www.greenmangaming.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2-pc/">AU$66.20</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Original story:</i>
      </p>
      <p>Roughly a year after its initial release on PS4 and Xbox One, Red Dead Redemption 2 finally comes to PC tomorrow. And it looks like it'll be worth the wait: in addition to new missions, horses, trinkets and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/au/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-content-preorder-bonus/">a whole bunch of other stuff</a> exclusive to the PC version, it'll definitely look a whole lot prettier, too.</p>
      <p>The game will unlock at exactly midnight tonight, AEST time (check out the full <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/au/when-does-red-dead-2-pc-unlock/">unlock timetable</a> if you're elsewhere in the world). Pre-loads are currently available on the Rockstar Games Launcher and Epic Games Store, and you'll need around 110GB space – so get deleting. As for hardware specs, here are the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/au/red-dead-redemption-2-system-requirements/">minimum and recommended requirements</a>.</p>
      <p>Prices for Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC aren't particularly variable at this stage, and who you go with will depend on whether you value a couple of bucks off the usual total, or a bunch of bonuses that come with buying it direct from the Rockstar Games Launcher. Here are the current options – let us know if you've found better.</p>
      <p>All prices are for the Standard Edition (except where noted):<br/><br/><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9128288/type/dlg/https://www.greenmangaming.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2-pc/"><b>$82.75 @ Green Man Gaming</b></a><b><br/></b>As is common, Green Man Gaming has an eight percent discount on Red Dead Redemption 2 at launch (and right now), meaning it's currently the cheapest option.</p>
      <p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=HlvbvYZP82I&amp;offerid=709353.15040221214&amp;type=15&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fred-dead-redemption-2"><b>$89.95 @ Fanatical<br/></b></a>If you pre-purchase the game at Fanatical you'll get a five percent discount, which brings the price down to $85.45.</p>
      <p><b>$89.95 @ Rockstar Games Launcher</b><br/>A few points to take into account if buying it direct: for this price you're getting the Special Edition rather than the Standard Edition (which is usually $120). Not only that, but you get a free Rockstar game from among GTA 3, GTA: Vice City, Max Payne 3, LA Noire, Bully: Scholarship Edition and GTA: San Andreas. In terms of bang for buck it's probably the best option.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/red-dead-redemption-2/home"><b>$94.45 @ Epic Games Store</b></a><br/>The lack of regional pricing on the Epic Games Store really puts it at a disadvantage. The above price is how much US$64.99 is in Australia right now according to Xe.com. Australians should obviously avoid buying it here.</p>
