      <p>Tension between Google and its workers mounted Friday as approximately 200 people gathered outside the company’s San Francisco offices to protest its decision to place two employees on administrative leave and increase restrictions on access to information.The protesters, both Google employees and workers at other San Francisco tech companies, denounced a wide range of actions by the Mountain View, California tech giant that they described as intimidation tactics and efforts to suppress an open culture. Some held up signs pointing Google’s philosophy back at itself, including those that said “Don’t be evil” and “Principles aren't principles when you pick and choose when you're gonna follow them.”</p>
      <p>“The travesty of it all, what we’re all seeing, is that leadership doesn’t know us anymore,” said Laurence Berland, one of the suspended employees. “They don’t understand us.” </p>
      <p>Berland and other speakers roused the crowd to chants and cheers, but also boos and hisses at the mention of Google’s recent actions, like the revelation that it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/technology/Google-union-consultant.html">hired an anti-union consulting firm</a> to push back against employee activism.</p>
      <p>“You hire consultants like that because you’ve decided to crack down on your employees,” Berland said. “Unfortunately for them, it isn’t working.”</p>
      <p>In recent months, the company has also implemented <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-23/google-accused-of-creating-spy-tool-to-squelch-worker-dissent">a tool for tracking large meetings</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-dirty-war-over-diversity-inside-google/">changed its “community guidelines</a>” to make certain topics off-limits and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-shakes-up-its-tgif-and-ends-its-culture-of-openness/">altered the structure</a> of its once-weekly all-hands meetings. </p>
      <p>Google placed both Berland and Rebecca Rivers on administrative leave earlier in November. A Google spokesperson <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/one-google-staffer-fired-two-others-put-on-leave-amid-tensions">told <i>Bloomberg</i></a>, which first reported the news, that the employees were suspended for sharing confidential documents outside the scope of their job or for tracking staff calendars, which caused those staff members to feel unsafe. Organizers of the protest say that the pair were punished as retaliation for workplace organizing.</p>
      <p>It was a “brute force intimidation attempt,” they wrote <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jilliandonfro/2019/11/21/google-employees-plan-a-rally-to-protest-the-administrative-leave-of-two-coworkers/#4db13f1417ea">in a statement before the event</a>. A Google spokesperson said the company investigates and takes action against violations of company policies, but denies the specific reasons that protest organizers say the two employees were placed on leave.</p>
      <p>Both employees have been active in employee-led protests against Google’s business relationships or practices. Rivers, for example, helped to create a petition in opposition of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/8/14/20805562/human-rights-concerns-google-employees-petition-cbp-ice">Google's contracts with U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a>. She said Google told her it was investigating her document access, but that many of the questions asked focused instead on her involvement with the petition.</p>
      <p>Berland, meanwhile, was active in employee protests against YouTube’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18758741/google-lgbtq-employees-sf-pride-removal-celebrations-san-francisco">policy on hate speech</a>.</p>
      <p>The pair also criticized Google for how it’s handled their suspensions. Google placed Berland on administrative leave without warning, he said, and “the only word the company would use to tell me what was wrong was that it was for an ‘issue.’” </p>
      <p>“They’re not telling me what’s going on, and I’m starting to wonder if they even know,” he told <i>Forbes.</i></p>
      <p>Other employees spoke at the rally as well, including analyst Marie Collins, who read out statements from Google’s contract workers. More than half of Google’s global workforce is made up of so-called “shadow workers,” or temps and contractors that typically make less, lack job security, and have to shell out higher costs for benefits.</p>
      <p>One worker on stage, engineer Zachary Siegel, also took a jab at Google’s own business practices.</p>
      <p>He highlighted the irony of his colleagues being placed on leave for looking at documents ruled “need-to-know,” or outside the scope of their jobs. Google has been criticized for hoovering up user data, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jilliandonfro/2019/11/11/google-ascension-project-nightingale-electronic-medical-records/">sometimes opaquely, with little clarity on its purpose</a>.</p>
      <p>“As a Google user myself, I wish I had the ability to tell Google that my information is ‘need-to-know,’” he said.  “We can’t hide anything from Google. And yet we have no right to know how that information is used.”</p>
