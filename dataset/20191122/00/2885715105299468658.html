      <h2>The Bill, which seeks to ban commercial surrogacy, was passed by the Lok Sabha in the monsoon session and was taken up for discussion in the Upper House on Tuesday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:09:16+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>The government on Thursday referred the surrogacy Bill to a 23-member select committee of Rajya Sabha. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan moved a resolution in the House, referring the Bill to a select committee.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha members had on Wednesday sought amendments in certain provisions of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019, that seeks to ban commercial surrogacy in India. The Bill only allows a close relative to act as a surrogate to couples who have been legally married for at least five years.</p>
      <p>Harsh Vardhan moved a motion in the House, referring the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019, to the select committee. The members approved the motion by voice vote.</p>
      <p>“I move the motion that Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019… as passed by Lok Sabha be referred to a select committee of the Rajya Sabha consisting of following members…,” Vardhan said. The members are Bhupender Yadav, Vikash Mahatme, Saroj Pandey, Ashwani Vaishnav, Jairam Ramesh, Amee Yajnik, A R Biswas, A Navaneethakrishnan, Ravi Prakash Verma, Prasanna Acharya, Ramchandra Prasad Singh, Banda Prakash, K Somaprasad, R S Bharathi, Veer Singh, Vandana Chavan, Anil Desai, Naresh Gujral, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sushil-kumar">Sushil Kumar</a> Gupta, V Vijayasai Reddy, Hishey Lachungpa, Parimal Nathwani and Sambhaji Chhatrapati.</p>
      <p>The minister said the panel has been asked to submit its report by the last day of last week of the next session. However, Vardhan did not name the chairman of the committee.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha Chairman M <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/venkaiah-naidu">Venkaiah Naidu</a> said the head of the committee would also attach an annexure in its report, providing details of the number of members attending the meetings of the panel.</p>
      <p>As reported by <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>, the Rajya Sabha had on Wednesday deferred passage of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill after several members opposed certain provisions and demanded that the Bill be modified.</p>
      <p>The members had sought changes in provisions that only a close relative can be a surrogate mother, as well as the clause that surrogacy is permitted for couples after at least five years of marriage.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, several members had argued that the government has not taken into consideration recommendations made by the Parliamentary standing committee which scrutinised the Bill.</p>
