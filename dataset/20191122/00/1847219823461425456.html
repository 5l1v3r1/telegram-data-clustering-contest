        <b>Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić has blamed Russia of spying after a man described as former Russian deputy military attache was filmed secretly giving cash to a man in Serbia.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Serbian public broadcaster RTS and British <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/21/serbia-investigates-video-claiming-to-show-russian-spy-paying-off-official">news portal The Guardian </a>report that on Thursday, November 21, said that Serbia’s intelligence agencies have uncovered a Russian intelligence plot involving members of the Serbian army and summoned the Russian ambassador to explain the situation.</p>
      <h3>Serbian officials have identified the agent as Georgy Kleban, who worked as deputy military attache at Russia’s embassy in Belgrade.</h3>
      <p>It is believed he left his post last year.</p>
      <p>Vučić named the Serbian man in the video only as Z.K and said he was a retired member of the Serbian military.</p>
      <p>The Serbian President also stated that that relations with Moscow would not suffer. «We will not change our policy towards Russia, which we see as a brotherly and friendly country … but we will strengthen our own intelligence defences,» noted Vučić.</p>
