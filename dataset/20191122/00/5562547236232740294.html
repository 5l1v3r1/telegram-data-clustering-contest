      <p>Basketball fans are holding their breath for Boston Celtics guard Kemba Walker who was carried off the Pepsi Center floor on a stretcher following an apparent neck injury on Friday night.</p>
      <p>The guard ran into a teammate with his head down and was on the floor as fans and players looked on. The Denver crowd gave Walker a standing ovation as he was wheeled off the court on a stretcher.</p>
      <p>Walker ran into Semi Ojeleye in the second quarter of the team’s contest while pursuing a loose ball. He immediately hit the deck and showed little movement, struggling to even brace his fall after contact.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/KyleDraperTV/status/1198076586303471617">Kyle Draper of NBC Sports</a> reports that Walker’s eyes were open and blinking as he was transferred off the court.</p>
      <p>We’ll update this story as more details become available.</p>
