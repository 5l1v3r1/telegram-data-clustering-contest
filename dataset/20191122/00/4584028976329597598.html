      <p>Four players and one team official have been found guilty of breaching the Cricket West Indies Code of Conduct during the Colonial Medical Insurance Super50 Cup.</p>
      <p>The four players are Jonathan Carter, Joshua da Silva, Keon Harding and Akeal Hosein; while Trinidad &amp; Tobago Red Force head coach Mervyn Dillon was also found guilty of a breach.</p>
      <p>Four out of the five admitted to their offences and accepted the imposition of the proposed sanctions, so there was no need for formal hearings.</p>
      <p>In the case of Harding, he was charged with two breaches in the same game – a Level 1 to which he admitted and accepted the proposed sanction, and a Level 2, which he intends to appeal.</p>
      <p>On-field umpires Nigel Duguid and Lyndon Rajkumar, and reserve umpire Bernard Joseph reported carter for a Level 1 breach of the Code of Conduct. The breach occurred during the match between Barbados Pride and Jamaica Scorpions on November 20 at the Conaree Cricket Centre in St. Kitts.</p>
      <p>The Pride captain was fined 10 per cent of his match fee by match referee Stewart Rawlins after he breached paragraph 2.3 of the Code of Conduct, relating to the abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings.</p>
      <p>Joseph and Rawlins reported hearing loud, crashing glass coming from the Pride dressing room and discovered that Carter was responsible for a broken glass window upon investigation.</p>
      <p>Da Silva was reported by on-field umpires Gregory Brathwaite and Leslie Reifer Jr, and reserve umpire Christopher Wright for a Level 1 breach of the Code of Conduct during the match between West Indies Emerging Players and the United States on November 19 at the Brian Lara Cricket Academy in Trinidad.</p>
      <p>The WI Emerging Players wicketkeeper/batsman was reprimanded by match referee Hayden Bruce after he breached paragraph 2.4 of the Code of Conduct by showing dissent at an umpire’s decision by action or verbal abuse.</p>
      <p>The umpires reported that Da Silva hung around for an extended period of time and pointed to his forearm before leaving the field after he was adjudged lbw to Noshthush Kenjige for 31.</p>
      <p>Dillon was reported by on-field umpires Gregory Brathwaite and Carl Tuckett, TV umpire Leslie Reifer Jr and reserve umpire Christopher Taylor for a Level 1 breach of the Code of Conduct during the match between Red Force and Guyana Jaguars on November 8 at Queen’s Park Oval in Trinidad.</p>
      <p>The Red Force head coach was reprimanded and fined 20 per cent of the team official’s match fee by match referee Reon King after he breached paragraph 2.4 of the Code of Conduct when he failed to follow an umpire’s instruction during the match.</p>
      <p>The umpires reported that Dillon entered the field of play during the first refreshments break of the match and was seen having a discussion with the Red Force players, after he was specifically told at the pre-tournament meeting on November 5 that no coaches are allowed onto the field of play during the hours of play.</p>
      <p>First, Harding was reported by on-field umpires Gregory Brathwaite and Christopher Wright, TV umpire Carl Tuckett and reserve umpire Jonathan Blades for a Level 1 breach of the Code of Conduct during the match between West Indies Emerging Players and the United States on November 19 at the Brian Lara Cricket Academy in Trinidad.</p>
      <p> The WI Emerging Players fast bowler was fined 10 per cent by match referee Hayden Bruce after he breached paragraph 2.3 of the Code of Conduct, relating to the abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings.</p>
      <p>The umpires reported that Harding struck a garbage bin near to the entrance of the players’ enclosure with such strong force that it was heard on the field of play. This happened after he left the field of play following his dismissal lbw to Noshthush Kenjige for a duck.</p>
      <p>Coming out of the same incident, Harding was also reported for a Level 2 breach of the Code of Conduct and was fined 70 per cent by Bruce for breaching paragraph 3.2 of the Code for showing serious dissent at an umpire’s decision by action or verbal abuse.</p>
      <p>The umpires reported that Harding showed dissent immediately at the crease when he was dismissed, and also struck an advertising hoarding when he was leaving the field.</p>
      <p>At a hearing the following day attended by Harding, West Indies Emerging Players head coach Floyd Reifer and the umpires, the player admitted to showing dissent at the crease but not striking the advertising hoarding.</p>
      <p>Harding has until November 30 to appeal the imposition of the second fine.</p>
      <p>Hosein was reported by on-field umpires Gregory Brathwaite and Christopher Wright, TV umpire Carl Tuckett and reserve umpire Jonathan Blades for a Level 1 breach of the Code of Conduct during the match between Trinidad &amp; Tobago Red Force and West Indies Emerging Players on November 13 at Queen’s Park Oval in Trinidad.</p>
      <p>The Red Force spin bowler was reprimanded by match referee Michael Ragoonath after he breached paragraph 2.2 of the Code of Conduct when he failed to follow the instructions of the umpires.</p>
      <p>Hosein was instructed not to enter the field of play at the end of the 13th over by the on-field umpires and was further advised by the reserve umpire at the start of the 14th over that he was not allowed to enter the field of play at that time.</p>
      <p>The player, however, proceeded onto the field at the end of the 14th over in breach of the umpires’ instructions.</p>
