      <h1>Xiaomi Redmi K30: A Snapdragon 730 with 30 W charging to accompany its 120 Hz display?</h1>

        <b>The pieces of the Redmi K30 puzzle are falling into place, with Xiaomi having said to expect the series to arrive next month. Leaked images and China Compulsory Certificate documentation have seemingly confirmed several aspects of Xiaomi's next mid-range offering, including a display capable of 120 Hz refresh rates.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Redmi K20 and K20 Pro, sold as the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Xiaomi-Mi-9T-Smartphone-Review-A-midranger-with-record-battery-life.428018.0.html">Mi 9T</a> and <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Xiaomi-Mi-9T-Pro-Redmi-K20-Pro-Smartphone-Review-Not-another-Mi-9-with-a-pop-up-camera.428552.0.html">Mi 9T Pro</a> in some regions, impressed us during our time with them earlier this year. Xiaomi has already confirmed that we should be expecting successors shortly, and now two sources may have given us some key details about the upcoming handsets. Neither corroborate the pictures purporting to be the K30 that leaked earlier this week, though.</p>
      <p>According to information we could glean from a China Compulsory Certificate listing, the K30 series will support not only 5G connectivity but also 30 W charging. Both would be boons for a mid-range handset in our opinion, although 30 W charging may help mitigate the frequency with which the device would need juicing up because of its power-hungry 5G modem.</p>
      <p>Leaked photos also show the K30 sporting dual-punch-hole front-facing cameras, a switch from the motorised solution that Xiaomi used on the K20 series. The photos also show AIDA64 reporting the K30 as having a 6.66-inch 1080p display that can operate at a refresh rate of up to 120 Hz. The <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Qualcomm-Snapdragon-730-SoC-Benchmarks-and-Specs.427214.0.html">Qualcomm Snapdragon 730</a> will apparently power the K30 too, the same SoC that Xiaomi included in the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Xiaomi-Mi-9T-Smartphone-Review-A-midranger-with-record-battery-life.428018.0.html">K20</a>.</p>
      <p>If the information above reflects reality, then expect Xiaomi to opt for a more powerful chipset in the Redmi K30 Pro. A <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Qualcomm-Snapdragon-855-SoC-Benchmarks-and-Specs.375436.0.html">Snapdragon 855</a> underpins the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Xiaomi-Mi-9T-Pro-Redmi-K20-Pro-Smartphone-Review-Not-another-Mi-9-with-a-pop-up-camera.428552.0.html">K20 Pro</a>, for example, so potentially the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Qualcomm-Snapdragon-855-Plus-855.435260.0.html">Snapdragon 855+</a> could be on the cards.</p>
