      <p>Cairo_22 November 2019: Cairo International Stadium witnessed another historic night on Friday as young Pharaohs defeated Ivory Coast 2_1 to secure Egypt's first title at the competition. <br/><br/>The national team continued their amazing run at the tournament to win the title after achieving five victories out of five games. <br/><br/>Over 75,000 Egyptian fans packed the stadium to support the young Pharaohs against the tournament's underdogs. <br/><br/>Egypt's first goal came minutes before half time thanks to an accurate shot from the team right wing Karim El Iraqi who received a wonderful cross from the man of the match Ramadan Sobhy. <br/><br/>Ivory Coast shocked Egyptian fans who were ready to celebrate the victory as Ndombia scored a dramatic injury-time equaliser to send the game to extra time. <br/><br/>Sobhy proved he is a world class player and scored Egypt's winning goal seven minutes before the final whistle. <br/><br/>Egypt, Ivory Coast and South Africa will be the three representatives of the black continent at the Men's football tournament during Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic Games.</p>
