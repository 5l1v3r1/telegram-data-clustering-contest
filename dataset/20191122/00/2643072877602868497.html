      <p>The National Economic Council (NEC) presided over by Vice President<b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/09/20/difference-between-buharis-economic-advisory-council-and-osinbajos-nec-gov-yahaya/"><u> Yemi Osinbajo</u></a></b> has approved the investment of an additional $250million into the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).</p>
      <p>The NSIA Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer,<a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2017/09/19/investment-nigeria-attracts-american-investors-targets-25b-fdi/"><u><b> Mr Uche Orji</b></u></a>, who briefed State House correspondents after the meeting, said the NEC had also approved the constitution of a committee to be chaired by Governor Nasir El-Rifai of Kaduna State to consider how a portion of the Pension Fund can be leveraged into investment in the NSIA with possible implementation with PenCom.</p>
      <p>Orji said the membership of the committee will include the Minister of Finance, Budget, and National Planning, the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and the NSIA MD.</p>
      <p>He said as at the first six months period ended in 2019, the NSIA had made a profit of N24 billion so far. Orji said it was achieved in the face of a volatile international market environment driven by the trade dispute between the United States and China as well as Brexit challenges. Related</p>
