      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:37:09+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:37</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United are set to discuss a potential deal for Nicolo Zaniolo during talks with Roma over Chris Smalling, according to reports from Italy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> need more attacking options after scoring just 16 goals in 12 Premier League games so far this season.</p>
      <p>Zaniolo has been on the Red Devils' radar since early this year when he scored both Roma's goals in a 2-1 Champions League win over Porto - and he caught the eye again with another double in Italy's 9-1 thrashing of Armenia this week.</p>
      <p>United scouts were in Palermo to watch the 20-year-old attacking midfielder, as well as Brescia midfielder Sandro Tonali, according to <a href="https://www.ilmessaggero.it/sport/calcio/zaniolo_roma_united_italia_nazionale_mercato-4873447.html">Il Messaggero</a> .</p>
      <p>The Italian publication says United officials will discuss a possible move for Zaniolo during meetings with Roma over Smalling's future.</p>

      <p>United defender Smalling has impressed on loan at the Serie A side after finding himself surplus to requirements at Old Trafford, and his temporary move <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/chris-smalling-says-misses-man-20877738">could be made permanent in the summer</a> .</p>
      <p>And the Red Devils will hope their relationship with Roma can help smooth the way to bring one of Europe's most promising attacking talents to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Zaniolo can play through the middle or on the right wing, and has scored three goals for Roma in Serie A so far this season.</p>

      <p>But United know they need to move quick if they want to sign the five-cap Italy international, with his stock rising all the time.</p>
      <p>With his contract at Roma due to run for another four-and-a-half years, Zaniolo will not come cheap, and football stats website <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/nicolo-zaniolo/profil/spieler/392085">Transfermarkt</a> currently values him at Â£36million.</p>
      <p>United are also in the market for a centre forward in the January transfer market, and Roma's former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> striker <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-consider-edin-dzeko-20926301">Edin Dzeko has been touted as a possible alternative</a> to out-of-favour <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> man Mario Mandzukic.</p>
