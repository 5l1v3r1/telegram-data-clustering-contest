      <p>The Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency has advised Lagos residents to get ready to experience extreme heat in the coming days.</p>
      <p>General Manager of LASEPA, Adedolapo Fasawe, in a statement urged residents to ensure adequate ventilation at homes and offices in order to mitigate the intensity of the prevailing heatwave.</p>
      <p>Fasawe also advised Lagosians to adequately prepare for the heat intensity associated with the dry season, which had manifested globally as heatwaves with serious public health implications.</p>
      <p>She said that Lagos, being a highly urbanised city, had a higher risk of increased warming due to the heat.</p>
      <p>She stated, “High rate of fire and flooding incidents are some of the effects of heatwaves, and this underscores the need to desist from burning refuse, being a contributory factor to a high rate of heatwaves.</p>
      <p>“Other factors that contribute to heatwaves include the use of poorly-serviced generators and use of ozone-depleting materials, all of which add to greenhouse gas emissions.”</p>
