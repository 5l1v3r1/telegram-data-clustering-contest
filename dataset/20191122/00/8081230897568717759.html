      <p>Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico are exploring the idea of allowing oil companies to recycle wastewater and either transfer it to other users or release it into surface water, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1061525917">according to E&amp;E News</a>.</p>
      <p>The oil industry generally disposes of wastewater in deep injection wells. </p>
      <p>The plan intends to help the oil industry cope with its growing waste disposal problem, but environmentalists warn the oil industry could end up polluting waterways instead. </p>
      <p>"We can't bring those discharges back," <a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1061525917">said Nichole Saunders</a>, a senior attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund's Climate and Energy Program.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma could get approval from U.S. EPA to start issuing permits that will allow the oil industry to dispose of oil field waste in waterways within the year, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1061525917">reported E&amp;E News</a>.</p>
      <p>Texas and New Mexico enacted laws this spring requiring their environmental agencies to explore the idea, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1061525917">according to E&amp;E News</a>. The regulations on releasing treated wastewater into surface water will likely vary from state to state. </p>
      <p><a href="https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/fiscal-notes/2015/october/fracking.php">The oil industry in Texas produces 357 billion gal of wastewater a year</a>, while Oklahoma and New Mexico also produce billions of barrels of waste each year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1061525917">Experts believe</a> the oil industry is gradually running out of space to dispose of wastewater in the deep aquifers.</p>
      <p>Companies could be handling produced water from thousands of sites, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1061525917">according to E&amp;E News</a>. Considering each site may have a different geology, each well could be treated with a different blend of drilling chemicals, ultimately changing the makeup of the wastewater.</p>
      <p>"We're talking about a very, very complex waste stream that changes from well to well, region to region, day to day," said Saunders.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.gwpc.org/">The Groundwater Protection Council</a> believes more information is needed before produced water can be released into fresh water.</p>
      <p>Though the state is holding a series of meetings on produced water reuse, officials are proceeding with caution nonetheless. </p>
      <p>It is not clear what discharge limits would be implemented. </p>
