      <p>The National Democratic Congress (NDC) has accused the National Peace Council (NPC) of deliberately fixing dates of meetings for discussions on the draft roadmap to address political vigilantism in Ghana on days of the impending court case of its National Chairman, Samuel Ofosu-Ampofo.</p>
      <p>The NDC explained that if it happens that way, they have no option that to honour the court hearing instead of the vigilante meeting because for the court, the accused could be cited for contempt should he refuse to appear.</p>
      <p>The NDC did not show up on Thursday for the final discussions on the draft roadmap.</p>
      <p>But the Chairman of the Council, Reverend Professor Emmanuel Asante, was confident the NDC will sign the roadmap since they had a copy.</p>
      <p>Rev Prof Emmanuel Asante explained that “[the NDC] are fully aware that this document is being discussed. The outcome will be conveyed to them and a date will be set for the public signing after we have endorsed it”.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ofosu Ampofo is standing trial at an Accra Commercial High Court over a leaked tape said to have come from his meeting with some party officers.</p>
      <p>He has been charged for conspiracy to cause harm and assault against a public officer.</p>
      <p>He has been charged alongside a Deputy National Communications Officer, Anthony Kweku Boahene.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with Onua FM’s Yen Sempa hosted by Nana Yaw Opare on Friday, the General Secretary of the NDC, Johnson Asiedu Nketia, said: “Ofosu Ampofo is our leader so we don’t know whether it was coincident or deliberate that whenever we are going to court, Peace Council fixes the date on that same day”.</p>
      <p>He explained that he can be cited for contempt if he fails to appear before the court but no one will cite him for contempt for not appearing at a vigilante meeting.</p>
      <p>"We are the same people that go to court so you can’t eat your cake and have it”.</p>
      <p>The vigilante dialogue was instituted by the National Peace Council following the violence that erupted at the Ayawaso West Wuogon Constituency by-election, which saw the ruling party’s then candidate, Lydia Seyram Alhassan, emerge as the winner.</p>
