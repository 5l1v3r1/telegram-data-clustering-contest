      <h1>Amazon drop prices across Kindles in the Black Friday sales</h1>
      <h2>Deals are available now on the Kindle, Kindle Paperwhite and Kindle Oasis</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:01:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Bennett, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/neil-bennett/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2KIvzfZ">Amazon</a> have kicked off their Black Friday sale a week before the day itself.</p>
      <p>The Amazon Kindle is among dozens of digital products that have been reduced in price, with offers on the Kindle, the Kindle Paperwhite and the Kindle Oasis.</p>
      <p>There are a total of three Kindles available on the market: the Kindle, the Kindle Paperwhite and the Kindle Oasis.</p>
      <p>The cheapest of the three options is the Kindle; a device that is 'purpose-built' for reading. It's front light has 4 LEDs, which is 21 LEDs less than the Oasis, but still enough to read indoors and outdoors, day or night.</p>
      <p>The 167 ppi glare-free display 'reads like printed paper' and has been designed to withstand even direct sunlight.</p>
      <p>As well as digitising your book collection, the Kindle also allows you to interact with your favourite texts by highlighting passages, looking up definitions, translating words and adjusting text size.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://amzn.to/333rQzP">Kindle Paperwhite (2018) - £84.99 - Saving of £35</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://amzn.to/2rcYpyh">Kindle Oasis (2019) - £179.99 - Saving of £50</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Whereas an 'entry-level' Kindle has an indented screen, the Paperwhite has an all-glass front that <a href="http://digitaltrends.com/">digitaltrends.com</a> describes as giving "a slightly more expensive feel and look".</p>
      <p>The Paperwhite is also said to have greater durability, an improved frontlight and greater features surrounding Audible, Bluetooth and water-resistance.</p>
      <p>The all-new Oasis, meanwhile, has further additional components including adjustable light sensors, an ergonomic design and an auto-rotating page orientation as seen on modern smart phones.</p>
      <p>What is 'better' comes down to personal preference. Despite the added features on the Paperwhite and Oasis, many still opt for the original Kindles smaller and lighter design.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in <a href="https://amzn.to/2D2OCx8">Amazon's Kindle Store</a>, deals have also been placed on a series of refurbished devices and accessories including leather covers have also been discounted by at least 20%</p>
