        <b>Sebastien Bourdais will leave the Dale Coyne Racing IndyCar squad following the recent collapse of a proposed sponsorship deal for the 2020 season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Four-time Champ Car champion Bourdais has raced for Coyne for the past three seasons, and recently tested IndyCar's new <a href="https://www.autosport.com/indycar/news/147024/bourdais-aeroscreen-will-make-cars-slower">aeroscreen protection device</a> with the team.</p>
      <p>The split was formally confirmed on Friday evening when it was announced Bourdais will race alongside Joao Barbosa at the JDC-Miller Motorsports Cadillac DPi squad in next year's IMSA SportsCar Championship.</p>
      <p>"Letting Sebastien go is sad and it's got nothing to do with other drivers on the market or anything like that," Coyne told Autosport.</p>
      <p>"It's very unfortunate. It's due to a funding issue. Something big fell through about two and a half weeks ago.</p>
      <p>"We got the bad news just before we went testing with Sebastien at Sebring [with the aeroscreen] on November 5.</p>
      <p>"We broke it to everyone the night of that test. It was sad. It is sad.</p>
      <p>"He's a victim of circumstances that were largely out of our control."</p>
      <p>Asked if there was any chance of reversing this decision should Bourdais land a big sponsor, Coyne said: "No. Sebastien is looking at other options - in fact he was investigating even before this happened - so it's only fair to let him continue doing that.</p>
      <p>"We wish him well, and I'm sure he'll be racing something next year."</p>
      <p>Coyne said he thinks Jimmy Vasser and James Sullivan will remain co-entrants of the #18 car, and also expects technical director Craig Hampson to stay with the squad.</p>
      <p>"He's [Hampson] sad too," Coyne commented.</p>
      <p>"Craig and Seb have been friends for many, many years, and had a lot of success together, so he's not happy with what's happened.</p>
      <p>"But he understands, too, and I think he'll stick with us."</p>

      <p>The team owner added he was confident the team's other driver, Santino Ferrucci, will renew his deal and can step up to become a team leader should a rookie take the second seat.</p>
      <p>"Providing he stays - and I'm pretty sure he will - Santino can do a good job for the team," said Coyne.</p>
      <p>"He is already the team leader on the ovals, right? He's been stellar.</p>
      <p>"He should have won Gateway, and he finished fourth in the 'oval championship'.</p>
      <p>"Seventeenth on the road and street courses, but still, he looked decent and didn't make many big mistakes. He'll be fine."</p>
      <p>Asked if he had spoken to James Hinchcliffe, who was released by Arrow McLaren SP, Coyne added: "Oh sure, we've been in contact with James, as I'm sure a lot of people have.</p>
      <p>"But as I said, that's not why we've ended things with Sebastien."</p>
