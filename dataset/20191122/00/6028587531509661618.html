      <p>It’s safe to say that there is no ski resort quite like the Swiss town of St. Moritz, which looks nothing like the quaint timbered village of Zermatt, the hard charging resort of Verbier or tranquil Gstaad. St. Moritz rises above the lake of the same name like a compact fairy tale kingdom, but the turrets and towers belong to legendary five-star hotels like the storied Kulm Hotel, the Suvretta House and Badrutt’s Palace, places where champagne is the preferred tipple, Prada, Bogner and Moncler are what one wears to go skiing, and Rolls Royces are at the ready for a seamless trip to the lifts. Visitors who arrive by train wend their way up the sloping Via Serlas street past a veritable alphabet of 21st century excess, the Madison Avenue-style emporiums of Armani, Bulgari, Cartier and dozens more. Every winter, some of the top polo players in the world compete on the frozen Lake St. Moritz in the Snow Polo World Cup St. Moritz. The skijoring races on the ice give it a more egalitarian edge.</p>

      <p>You can make a strong case that the origins of modern winter sports lie here, starting in the 1860’s with hotelier Johannes Badrutt, who welcomed a steady stream of well-heeled British guests to his small Kulm Hotel. They came in summer to hike and take the waters. But in winter, Badrutt and his fellow hoteliers, routinely shut down their properties for lack of visitors.</p>
      <p>As the oft-told story goes, he wagered four of his best English guests that they would love the winter in a town that claims 300 days of sunshine a year. He asked them to return with their families. If they didn’t have fun, he would pick up the tab. The Brits accepted the bet and ended up staying—and paying—until spring. They spread the word back home, at a time when first ascents of Alpine peaks were making headlines in London, and soon other sports-minded English families followed. Over time, more hotels opened and a host of activities were formalized, from skiing and ice skating to curling and taking death-defying descents on the Cresta Run, the first skeleton course in the world. A winter sports capital was born.</p>
      <p>St. Moritz would go on to host the Winter Olympics in 1928, the first true Winter Olympics held on their own. St. Moritz held a second Winter Olympics in 1948, the first to be celebrated after World War II.</p>
      <p>The 5,200 natives are German and Romansch-speaking, Switzerland’s fourth language that is spoken mostly here in the Canton of Graubunden. Half a million visitors arrive each winter, a mixture of European high society and a chic nouveau riche crowd. Some of them even ski.</p>

      <p>Deep pockets are needed to check in to the five star emporiums, like The Carlton Hotel, where starting rates are north of $1,000 a night. For those who don’t require a purring Rolls Royce at the ready, there are a number of three and four star hotels that will do quite nicely, like the Belle Epoque Hotel Reine Victoria, the Crystal Hotel in the heart of the city or the Waldhaus am See, on the shores of the lake. Skiing aside, it’s well worth visiting the Segantini Museum, devoted to the paintings of late 19th century artist Giovanni Segantini, one of the country’s most important painters. The contemporary art world also has taken root here, at Galerie Gmurzynska, Hauser &amp; Wirth and the Vito Schnabel Gallery, with some of the same energy found at Art Basel.</p>

      <p>Sitting at 6,090 feet and close to the Italian border, St Moritz offers 350km of slopes spread out over four separate sectors, with sweeping panoramic vistas, thanks to the topography of the broad Engadin Valley. It’s enhanced by abundant sunshine, close as it is to the Italian border, less than two hours north of Lake Como. Indeed, the emblem of the resort is a golden sun. </p>

        <b>Hotel History</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wander into any of the five star hotels for a glimpse of the hotel history of the town, which has welcomed everyone from Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo and Alfred Hitchcock to Brigitte Bardot and even Vladimir Lenin. At Badrutt’s, for example, peek into the King’s Social House, rumored to be the oldest club in Switzerland, as well as the Renaissance Bar, a vintage smoking lounge favored by the contemporary jet set. Nearby is Hanselmann’s pastry shop, an 1894 classic, which offers a vintage taste of the resort in the form of nusstorte, an addictive shortbread of walnuts and caramel.</p>
      <p>No hotel is more closely associated with St. Moritz’s role in winter sports than the Kulm. Johannes Badrutt bought the modest 12-room Pension Faller in 1855, added on two stories, and transformed it into the town’s first actual hotel. Kulm was an apt name, meaning “rounded hill” in German.</p>
      <p>In the past century, the hotel has been expanded many times. It’s now a luxury property with 164 rooms and suites, multiple restaurants and bars and a wellness center. Though thoroughly modern, its history can be found if you know where to look.</p>

        <figcaption>The Cresta Run, St. Moritz<cite>St. Moritz Tourismus AG</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The St. Moritz Curling Club was established on the hotel’s grounds in 1880. The Cresta Run was constructed in 1884, and its governing club, the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club, was founded in 1887. Arguably the birthplace of skeleton racing, it was a men’s-only club for 90 years and opened to women only in winter 2019. The track was used in both the 1928 and 1948 Olympics and watching a few runs is de rigeur for visitors. (In skeleton racing, athletes ride a small sled, face-down and head-first, down a frozen bobsled-style track.)</p>
      <p>The Sunny Bar in the Kulm Hotel became the official home to the Cresta riders and lays claim to being the oldest ski bar in the Alps. Drop into the bar, which has been lavishly redecorated for today’s jet set and serves Peruvian food, and you’ll see the walls covered with vintage photographs of legendary riders. In the center of the coffered ceiling is an illuminated stretch of life-size “track” with upside-down vintage racing sleds.</p>
      <p>As winter sports took off, the Kulm Country Club, about a quarter mile from the hotel and the site of the golf course, became the starting point for the Olympic bobsled run in 1904, and was used in the Winter Olympic Games of 1928 and 1948. Since the 1930s, visitors have been welcome to take a ride on the bobsled, rocketing down the only natural-ice bobsleigh track in the world. Today a trip costs 269 Swiss francs ($269), including a glass of champagne at the end, and you can learn more about the sport at the Bobmuseum.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>At the Kulm Country Club, you’ll also find the Eispavillon (ice rink), which was renovated and reopened for the 2017 World Ski Championships in St. Moritz. The Eispavillon was used for both the 1928 and the 1948 Winter Olympics and the renovation and expansion of the 110-year-old building was done under the supervision of English architect Sir Norman Foster, a part-time St. Moritz resident. The closest thing to a dedicated ski museum in town is the building’s interior, which has bits and pieces of St. Moritz sporting history, including wooden bobsleds, photos and Olympic memorabilia. The exhibits change periodically. If you want to get a taste of the Olympic spirit, rent a pair of ice skates for 22 Swiss francs ($22) and twirl on the ice like Sonja Henie, who won gold here in 1928.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Strolling the Streets, Skiing the Pistes</b>
      </p>
      <p>On the other side of the rink is a Bauhaus-style building at Via Johannes Badrutt 16. When it was built in 1928, it had stadium seating on its roof and overlooked the Olympic ice rink, which doubled as the field for the opening and closing ceremonies. The building housed the changing facilities for athletes and officials during both the 1928 and 1948 Games. Over time, the small, one-story building with a connecting tower became derelict. Fortunately, it was bought by artist and designer Rolf Sachs, son of industrialist Gunther Sachs of Sachs-Opel. Sachs restored it as his private home. The rooftop stadium seats are long gone, but the outside has been carefully preserved. You can’t go inside, but stroll past. Sachs continues to fly the Olympic flag from the building’s roof and has kept the emblazoned letters that spell “Stadion St. Moritz” on its façade.</p>
      <p>When you’re done touring, head up the slopes of Corviglia to check out the start of the men's downhill race course at 2,840 meters (a little over 9,300 feet). It’s accessed by a gondola lift and a 178-step climb. The starting slope is called “Free Fall" because of its staggeringly precipitous drop, allegedly the steepest start gate in the world. Continue on by cable car up to the top of Piz Nair, at 3,057 meter (10,000 feet), where some of the 1948 Olympic races began. You can then savor a long run back to town, looking down at the frozen lake and the fairytale vista of this historic winter sport wellspring.
