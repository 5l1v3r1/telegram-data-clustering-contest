      <h1>Tesla cyber truck demo goes wrong as shatterproof windows break</h1>

      <p>Elon Musk unveiled Tesla Inc’s eagerly awaited electric pickup truck on Thursday but it didn’t go as planned, ending with two smashed windows and the hashtag #cybertruck trending on Twitter for all the wrong reasons.</p>
      <p>In the demo, Tesla chief designer Franz von Holzhausen initially took a sledgehammer to the truck, which withstood the impact. Then it all went wrong.</p>
      <p>Von Holzhausen took a metallic ball in his right hand, wound up and tossed it at the truck – smashing the front driver-side window, stunning the audience and viewers live streaming the event.“Oh my f—ing god,” Musk said, when the window broke.</p>

      <p>“Maybe that was a little too hard,” Musk said after the ball cracked the glass. So they tried again. A second test broke a second window.</p>
      <p>“It’s classic Tesla. It’s poetic,” said analyst Gene Munster of Loup Ventures. “I applaud the company for taking risks: this was not a boring presentation. The broken glass was unpredictable. This wasn’t practiced.”</p>
      <p>The event was shown on YouTube, with the video made private shortly after. The heavy-duty truck retails from $39,900 and will come in three different variants.</p>
      <p>“This obviously wasn’t a true production vehicle so Tesla gets a pass for now,” said Akshay Anand, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “But if they are going to market the glass as a differentiator, they better be able to show stronger tests leading up to launch.”</p>
