      <h1>Cesar Azpilicueta Responds to Jose Mourinho Being Appointed Tottenham Head Coach</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15300281" target="_blank">Ali Rampling</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta has wished his former manager Jose Mourinho all the best in his new job in charge of rivals Tottenham. </p>
      <p>Mourinho took the Spurs hot seat after Mauricio Pochettino was relieved of his duties following a poor start to the season.</p>
      <p>Azpilicueta played under Mourinho for just over two years at Chelsea during the manager's second spell at Stamford Bridge, and was part of Mourinho's title winning team in 2014/15.</p>

      <p>Although Mourinho has since managed <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">​Manchester United</a> and now begins his tenure in charge at London rivals <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/tottenham">​Spurs,</a> Azpilicueta has nothing but kind words for his former boss. </p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/11865955/jose-mourinho-cesar-azpilicueta-wishes-former-chelsea-boss-well-as-tottenham-head-coach">​Sky Sports</a>, the Spanish full-back said: "I can talk only when Jose was here at <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/chelsea">​Chelsea</a> with us. We won trophies, and now football moves on.</p>
      <p>"I wish him all the best even though he goes to a rival. I have good memories with him and I have played many times under him and against him."</p>

      <p>Tottenham and Chelsea will meet for the first time this season at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium three days before Christmas. Mourinho will then make his hotly anticipated return to Stamford Bridge exactly two months later on February 22. </p>
      <p>Tottenham and Chelsea already enjoy a fierce rivalry that has sparked back into life particularly in recent years, and Mourinho's appointment now adds an extra layer of bite.</p>

      <p>In 2015, Mourinho said he would <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6500903-jose-mourinho-becomes-tottenham-hotspur-boss-despite-2015-claim-that-he-would-never-manage-spurs">​never manage either one of the north London sides</a> out of respect for Chelsea, the club where he won three Premier League titles. However, Azpilicueta has played down the rivalry between the club and Mourinho.</p>
      <p>"Obviously when we play against each other we both want to win for our teams," he added. "But this is football. I wish him well."</p>
      <p>Azpilicueta was a firm favourite during Mourinho's time at Stamford Bridge. He played 37 times in the Premier League during Chelsea's 2014/15 title winning campaign, scoring twice. </p>
