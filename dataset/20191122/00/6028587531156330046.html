      <p>Nimal “Nims” Purja MBE completed his grueling climbs of all 14 of the world’s 8,000-meter (above 26,000 feet) peaks by summiting China’s Shishapangma on Oct. 29, 2019. His ambitious undertaking, called Project Possible, took under seven months in total, unthinkable by mountaineering (or any) standards, and set a world speed record for 8,000-er’s. It is one unlikely to be matched in the near future. The previous record had been almost eight years. We thought it would be interesting to catch up with Nims, a former British Gurkha and Special Forces soldier, to chat about his amazing feat. Following are edited excerpts from a longer conversation.<b>Jim Clash:</b> Of the world’s 14 8,000-meter peaks you just climbed, which was toughest?</p>
      <p><b>Nimal “Nims” Purja:</b> The hardest climb for me was Kangchenjunga, at 28,169 feet the world’s third-highest mountain. The first thing that made this summit difficult was the speed that I climbed and summited two 8,000-er’s, back-to-back. I had summited Dhaulagiri at 26,795 feet, the world’s seventh highest mountain, nonstop for four days previously, and went from base camp to the summit of Kangchenjunga afterwards in just 21 hours. The second thing that made this summit difficult was the rescue that Mingma David Sherpa, Gesman Tamang and I undertook on our descent from Kangchenjunga. At 27,723 feet, we found three climbers unable to continue in the death zone, and gave our oxygen to them. The rescue took over 11 grueling hours. Emotionally, the hardest part for me, as an ex-Gurkha soldier, was to witness 40 climbers at Camp 4 unwilling to help. Unlike myself and my team, who had quickly accelerated summiting two mountains and were exhausted, these 40 climbers had spent days acclimatizing to get to Camp 4. They should have been strong, willing and able to help. This is something I will not forget easily, and one of the reasons I feel strongly about the use of oxygen above 8,000 meters. It can simply save lives.</p>
      <p><b>Clash:</b> Have you ever met the great mountaineer, Reinhold Messner, who was first to summit all 8,000-meter peaks without supplemental oxygen?</p>
      <p><b>Nims:</b> I met Reinhold on Nanga Parbat. He is the only mountaineer I met in the beginning who, without even seeing me climb and after just a half an hour of conversation, said, “Nims, I can see in your eyes - it comes from your soul, from your heart – <i>I think you can do this project</i>.” Messner was so positive about Project Possible, to complete all 14 peaks above 8,000 meters in just seven months, that his energy was more than enough.</p>
      <p><b>Clash:</b> What are you afraid of, and how do you deal with fear?</p>
      <p><b>Nims:</b> I am not really afraid of anything. But there is an old saying: If someone says, “I’m not afraid of dying,” they must either be a Ghurka or they must be lying. I <i>am</i> a Ghurka (laughs)!</p>

      <p><b>Clash: </b>How did your Special Forces training in cold-weather warfare help you with Project Possible?</p>
      <p><b>Nims:</b> I can’t really talk about my Special Forces details here, although I am so glad that I had an opportunity to develop and train with them. How it helped me at large on mountaineering expeditions include my decision-making ability, and, of course, being able to operate in an extremely stressful environment. Overall, I would say it helped a lot.</p>
      <p><b>Clash:</b> Was your wife supportive of Project Possible?</p>
      <p><b>Nims:</b> My wife [Suchi] has always been supportive and proud of my accomplishments. She helps me with some of the administrative work around the expeditions, and knows when I am away that no news is good news. Funding has been the hardest part, and my wife has been extremely supportive both when I decided to leave my job, and even when I re-mortgaged our home and put equity into the project. I am lucky to have such a loving and supportive partner.</p>
      <p><b>Clash:</b> Do you think anyone can top your speed record?</p>
      <p><b>Nims:</b> I believe records are made to be broken, as that pushes the boundaries out yet again. What I am humble and proud about is that I was able to show a path, simply to demonstrate what <i>could</i> be possible with 8,000-meter peaks. Now that the paradigm has shifted, more people can relate to that possibility, and it should be easier next time to conceptualize and achieve it. </p>
      <p><b>Clash: </b>What’s next for you?</p>
      <p><b>Nims:</b> I have my company, Elite Himalayan Adventures, which provides a platform for those who seek to push their limits on extreme adventures, whether that be Everest and Lhotse in Nepal, or K2 and Broad Peak in Pakistan. I will be opening a new route on Cho Oyu from the Nepal side in 2020 in an effort to promote the Nepalese government’s campaign #visitnepal2020. This project will provide more opportunities for Nepal’s local climbing community. Finally, there could be a book and even a feature film [about Project Possible] out within the next year, but it is too soon to release any details about either of those. I am very grateful for all of the opportunities.</p>
