      <p>The University of Ghana Students Representative Council at the Accra City Campus is accusing the mother SRC, led by Isaac Agyemang, of cheating.</p>
      <p>According to Solomon Ocansey, who is the SRC President at the Accra City Campus, the mother SRC is refusing to give them their subventions although they have received some GHC 100,000 from University Management.</p>
      <p>He also accused the main SRC of withdrawing money the said amount without informing them.</p>
      <p>“Initially, I suggested to the main campus SRC President that we should write to the Dean of Students so that he can release some of the amount if not all so that we can still go about our activities for the interim. To my surprise, some weeks ago, I followed up on our endowment fund at the cash office and I realized that an amount of more than GHC100,000 has been withdrawn by the main campus SRC treasurer without our knowledge”</p>
      <p>Solomon Ocansey further accused the main SRC of discrimination in the release of subvention.</p>
      <p>“Currently, we have been hit by an apartheid SRC system where our own people who are to come to our aid to support us, are somehow neglecting us or discriminating against us. They have to provide us with some services so we have proper administration at our end”</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Dean of Students as to whether the main SRC has received the said amount, Professor Godfred Bokpin was unsure about the claim.</p>
      <p>“I cannot confirm that amount because it has not been approved and I am not too sure if that amount will remain if the budget is revised,” he told UniversNews</p>
      <p>However, Public Relations Officer of the SRC at the main campus, Daniel Osei Wereko has told UniversNews that the SRC has indeed received funds from University Management. But Daniel Wereko is not willing to disclose the exact amount received.</p>
      <p>“We have received money but I am not privy to the exact details so I can’t state the accurate amount”</p>
