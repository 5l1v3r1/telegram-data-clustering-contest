      <h1>BBMP plans to amp up its bus lane game</h1>

      <p><i>From marking entry and exit points, to deploying marshals to man bus lanes, BBMP will stop at nothing to make the BPL a success</i> <br/><br/>The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has made some important changes pertaining to the bus priority lanes. Following a meeting with the important stakeholders, BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar said that the civic body will now mark the points where bus lanes merge and separate from the traffic. He also said that the bus stops along the ORR will have a 100-metre barricade to prevent buses from overtaking each other. He also suggested building raised pedestrian crossings on the ORR service roads, near the bus stops, to enable passengers to cross service roads. Finally, he spoke about completing the remaining resurfacing work between Iblur–Silk Board junction. <br/><br/>The BBMP will be deploying marshals for the bus priority lane from the Silk Board to KR Puram on November 25 to ensure lane discipline is maintained. The initiative will be continued for about three months until all the markings are completed and bus lane signs are placed. Anil Kumar said, “The marshals will be trained by the traffic police from Monday to ensure that the bus lanes are used only by buses. Eighty marshals will be deployed along with some traffic personnel and will be paid the same amount that other marshals receive.” He added that the plan to deploy the marshals springs from the fact that the traffic police don’t have enough manpower for the project. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the residents of Bellandur will hold the the ‘Bellandur for Bus Priority Lane’ campaign on November 22, to support bus priority lanes. The campaign aims to create awareness among citizens to maintain lane discipline. It will include bike rallies and a human chain will also be formed. Kashinath Prabhu, a core member of Bellandur Jothege said, “We would like to run this campaign over the next two to three months, by conducting awareness sessions for citizens at critical junctions, holding placards and distributing flyers/pamphlets on the bus priority lane. Few riders will also ride with placards from Iblur junction to Ecospace/Intel office.” <br/><br/>During the campaign, they are also planning to collect feedback from citizens and passengers to help understand the effectiveness of the bus priority lane and its impact on commuting time and pollution caused. They want to tie up with ORRCA (Outer Ring Road Companies Association), BBMP, Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), traffic police and TWO (Traffic Warden Organisation) for this initiative.</p>
