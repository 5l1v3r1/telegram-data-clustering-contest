      <h1>Man accused of unprovoked attack on elderly man flips out in court</h1>

      <p>A 37-year-old man with a lengthy rap sheet threw a fit in Brooklyn Criminal Court Thursday and had to be dragged out by guards as he was brought to face charges for an unprovoked beating of a 77-year-old man.</p>
      <p>Romeil Moore, who has been charged with second-degree assault for the Oct. 8 attack in Clinton Hill, couldn’t keep quiet as Judge Hilary Gingold walked him through his charges and he insisted that he was the real victim.</p>
      <p>Even his own attorney asked him to be quiet.</p>
      <p>“I was assaulted by the Asian man!” Moore blurted out, saying there are audio recordings taken from a 99-cent store near the scene that support him.</p>
      <p>“The court reporter is sitting right there and taking down everything you say,” warned Moore’s lawyer, Michelle Riedel of Brooklyn Defender Services.</p>
      <p>Moore, who is tall and lanky and who appeared in court wearing a denim jacket and jeans, ignored the warning and kept trying to make his case.</p>
      <p>“Can I issue to the grand jury?” he repeated several times as two court officers took him by both arms and led him back to the holding cells.</p>
      <p>“That went worse than I expected,” Riedel said as she headed back to her seat.</p>
      <p>Moore was remanded and is being held without bail.</p>
      <p>Assistant District Attorney Wilfredo Cotto said that there is video footage of the alleged incident.</p>
      <p>Moore has an arrest record dating back to 1998 that includes multiple robbery counts and criminal possession of a weapon.</p>
