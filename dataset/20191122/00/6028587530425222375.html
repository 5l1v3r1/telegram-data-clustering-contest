      <p>For Denice Torres, mentorship is everything. She spent thirty years as a senior executive in the healthcare industry and believes that the people who took her under their wing are a major reason for her successful career. As a gay, Hispanic woman who grew up the daughter of a steel mill worker in Gary, Indiana, Torres says she didn’t know a lot of people who could help her learn what she refers to as <i>the game—</i>or how to navigate the complex social structures that allow someone to succeed in business.</p>
      <p>“It took me going to a number of different jobs and watching people to see what they were doing,” she says. “As I was working and taking on different roles, I ended up having some really terrific mentors, and then sponsors that truly changed my career trajectory, which in turn changed my life. Those people took me under their wing to tell me this is how it’s done and this is what you need to do.”</p>
      <p>Torres says hearing her mentors’ stories was incredibly powerful. “They weren’t just reciting things out of some book. They were telling me about their experiences, the lessons they learned. That was the biggest motivator for me.”</p>
      <p>When she retired, she knew she had to pay it forward. “I’ve always felt this desire and a calling to pass that on to other women and to diverse talent especially, and to those who feel like they don’t belong.”</p>
      <p>About a year ago, Torres launched The Mentoring Place, an organization for women that offers courses in career advancement as well as free one-on-one mentoring with top women executives and entrepreneurs. On LinkedIn, Torres also hosts livestream interviews with successful women. She also has her own podcast.</p>
      <p>Torres says The Mentoring Place already has a couple thousand women in its network. “I also do speaking, so these women will come up to me…they’ll say it changed their life, that they started asking for what they wanted.”</p>
      <p>The Mentoring Place motto is “Real World, No BS.” Torres hopes to cut through the often impractical or overused advice women tend to hear, like <i>just speak up and bring your whole self to work</i>.</p>
      <p>“There’s so much noise about how to help women,” Torres explains. “So many services, and there’s a sea of people teaching lessons they never experienced. Being thought of as in that pool is not something I enjoy, because [I have] thirty years of experiences where I’ve been there, and I have had those challenges and those failures and those successes.”</p>
      <p>Torres sees The Mentoring Place as a call for women to help one another. She says understanding that you need other people to be successful is one of the hardest lessons to learn. “You’re going to have to have people show you the way,” she says. “Go meet them. There’s no way we can stay in our comfort zone. We have to get out and we have to connect. We have to ask people for things.”</p>
      <p>In turn, she adds, we have to give back and help others, which isn’t always easy and isn’t always fun. “I spend an extraordinary amount of time on the phone talking to women in their darkest time,” she says. “It’s necessary to help people through the tough times and then celebrate them in the victory.”</p>
      <p>As The Mentoring Place grows, Torres’ goal is simply to help as many women as possible. “I want women to think, ‘Yes I can,’” she says, “and then have the passion and the resilience and the gumption to go do it.”</p>
