      <p>Habib forced an own goal after misdirecting a Luther Signh cross into his own net before Evans Mensah's sumptions strike leveled the scores on 50 minutes.</p>
      <p>The Black Meteors again fell back second half substitute Kamohelo Abel's goal before Samuel Obeng made the best from the wizardry skills of Evans Mensah on the right.</p>
      <p>The game headed straight in to penalty shootouts, and Ghana missed three spot kicks with the South Africans missing two after seven kicks.</p>
