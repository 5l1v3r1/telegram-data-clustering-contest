      <h1>Kean needs time, claims Silva</h1>

        <b>Everton manager Marco Silva has no concerns over Moise Kean, comparing the former Juventus striker to current Liverpool star Fabinho.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/m-kean-307752/">Moise Kean's</a> stuttering start to life at Everton <b>can be compared to how Liverpool regular Fabinho began </b>his career at Anfield, says Marco Silva.</p>
      <p><b>Kean was signed by Everton from Serie A giants Juventus </b>for a reported fee of £27.4million (€30m) in the close season. However, <b>the teenager is yet to score a goal for the club</b>, having made 11 appearances across all competitions so far, though only four of those have been starts.</p>
      <p>He was left out of Everton's squad for the 2-1 win over Southampton earlier in November <b>as punishment for missing the start of a team meeting</b>, with Italy coach Roberto Mancini - who has dropped Kean for a similar lack of discipline in the past - subsequently advising the former Juve youngster to <b>"find a club that lets him always play</b>."</p>

      <p>But Silva has confirmed Kean - <b>who scored twice in Italy Under-21s' win over Armenia </b>in midweek - will be in Everton's squad for Saturday's encounter with Norwich City, and <b>has compared his first few months at Goodison Park to the struggles endured by Fabinho</b>, who had to wait until late October to start a Premier League match for the Toffees' city rivals Liverpool last season.</p>
      <p>"<b>He wants to play more. Like all of the players we have</b>," Silva told a news conference.  We have to look for him and all the games we have played and he has played.<b> He has some starts in the Premier League,</b> some in the EFL Cup, you are not talking about a player who didn't play at all. You have many examples of players with more experience than him <b>coming to the Premier League and [at first] they didn't play</b>.</p>
      <p>"I think you have an example not really far, <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/fabinho-139208">Fabinho</a>,<b> a player more experienced, a big amount of money, first six months, he didn't play.</b> Most of the games he was in the stands. He's not the only example, I can give more, but <b>the most important thing for Moise is to keep teaching him</b>, for him to adapt as fast as he can.  Moise has all the support here. He has all the support from me, his team-mates. <b>What is the most important thing is what I speak to him directly</b>."</p>
