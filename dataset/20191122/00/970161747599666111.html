      <p>Richard Madeley threatened to boycott <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> Extra Camp by shouting into the jungle – and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/joel-dommett/">Joel Dommett</a> looked genuinely worried about it.</p>
      <p>The ITV host appeared on Extra Camp with Fleur East to discuss the antics on the show so far as his son-in-law <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-haskell/">James Haskell</a> is part of this year’s line-up.</p>
      <p>As he sat on the sofa he asked Joel and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/emily-atack/">Emily Atack</a>: ‘Are they in ear shot?</p>
      <p>‘Because my daughter Chloe asked me to do something.’</p>
      <p>Richard then put his hands to his face motioning as if he was going to shout something – and it did not go down well as the hosts’ panicked a bit as they responded ‘no no no no’.</p>

        <figcaption>He certainly panicked the hosts (Picture: ITV)</figcaption>

      <p>Laughing Richard continued: ‘My daughter wanted me to say “James I love you”.</p>
      <p>Joel added: ‘You not allowed it’s against the rules.’</p>

      <h3>What happened on Thursday night’s show?</h3>
      <p>When we thought it couldn’t get any better – TV bosses have thrown another two celebs in – and they have won the nation’s hearts already (we love you Cliff and Andy).</p>
      <p>Thursday night’s episode was probably one of the best ever and it’s safe to say <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> was on fire.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-a-celebritys-nadine-coyle-teaches-caitlyn-jenner-girls-aloud-dance-moves-and-its-pure-comedy-gold-11197437/">Not only did she learn the dance to Girls Aloud’s The Promise</a> (which was pure comedy gold) but she accidentally insulted newcomers <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-apologises-throws-shade-soap-stars-andy-whyment-cliff-parisi-11198083/">Andy Whyment and Cliff Parisi </a>for not knowing who they were as she questioned ‘Who are these ‘f***ing soap people?’</p>
      <p>And just in case you were wondering,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-a-celebritys-ian-wright-and-andrew-maxwell-make-up-after-crocodile-feet-row-as-the-comedian-clashes-with-jacqueline-jossa-11197129/"> Ian Wright and Andrew Maxwell have made up after they had a clash over crocodile feet (phew).</a></p>
