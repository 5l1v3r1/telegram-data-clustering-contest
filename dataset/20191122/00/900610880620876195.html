      <h1>Supercity Aparthotels launches partnership with homeless charity Accumulate</h1>

      <p>Supercity Aparthotels has launched a partnership with homeless charity, Accumulate. The new Supercity Art House will exhibit the artwork of young, formerly homeless people, and make it available for purchase at selected Supercity sites, with money going to support those affected by homelessness.</p>
      <p>Each piece of artwork displayed will also be made available for sale online via the Supercity <a href="https://supercityuk.com/supercity-art-house/">website</a>, with all money raised being donated to Accumulate to support the charity itself as well as contributing to the welfare of the artists exhibited.</p>
      <p>The Accumulate charity aims to rebuild the lives of young homeless people through creativity. It co-ordinates a series of workshops at hostels and in museums and galleries across London covering everything from creative writing to jewellery making.</p>
      <p>The artwork displayed as part of the Supercity Art House will showcase a range of the experimental artwork and photography created by participants of the Accumulate programme.</p>

      <p>Supercity has a longstanding commitment to combatting homelessness, having supported Crisis for the past five years including offering accommodation to volunteers over the Christmas period.</p>
      <p>Alexis Burton, CEO of Supercity said:</p>
      <p>“Supporting homeless communities is an integral part of our ethos at Supercity. We support Crisis at Christmas annually, offering accommodation for the volunteers, so the launch of the Supercity Art House, and partnership with Accumulate, is an exciting step in extending this support.</p>
      <p>“Through the sale of the artwork exhibited, we hope to be able to help fund many more creative programmes through Accumulate, while raising wider awareness around homelessness in our communities.”</p>
      <p>Marice Cumber Director of Accumulate adds:</p>
      <p>“We’re very pleased to have been chosen to work alongside Supercity Aparthotels to launch the first Supercity Art House. Our mission is to combat homelessness through the power of artwork, so, collaborating with an organisation who is as passionate as we are about creativity is very exciting.</p>
      <p>“It’s also a great opportunity to showcase, and gain recognition for the work of the many talented artists we support in the community.”</p>
      <p>The Supercity Art House will be open until January, 6, 2020 with artwork on sale at Templeton Place, The Chronicle and The Rosebery as well as online through <a href="https://supercityuk.com/supercity-art-house/">supercityuk.com.</a></p>
