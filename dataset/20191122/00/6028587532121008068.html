      <p>With the rise in consumerism currently more apparent than ever, brands are beginning to question the philosophy around commercial marketing opportunities such as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbarr/2019/11/20/the-future-of-black-friday/#7c73b42421b2">Black Friday</a>. These events can often result in scenes which bring out the worst in society, with angry shoppers fighting over what they claim to be are the best bargains. This notion, of investing in something just because it may be a good deal, has not only led to a huge spike in sales but also a rise in unused and unwanted purchases. Aside from the uncomfortable experience of elbowing your way through vast throngs of shoppers and rails of discounted goods, often made specifically for the expected rush and frequently with the quality reflecting the discounted prices, it breeds an extortionate level of mass consumption. Black Friday, occurring the day after Thanksgiving to mark the beginning of America’s Christmas shopping season, used to be a one-day event but now many companies now extend it over a longer period including other days such as Cyber Monday with some even beginning today, a week before the actual event! Whilst the tradition started in the US, it has now spread across the globe with many countries making the most of another marketing opportunity.</p>
      <p>With 12 reported deaths and 117 injuries since 2006 in the US as a result of the shopping mayhem, it still isn't enough to put customers off from the anticipation of getting a ‘good deal’. Combined with this, the environmental consequences are just as alarming. <a href="https://www.finder.com/uk/black-friday-statistics">Finder.com</a> estimate in the UK alone £7 billion will be spent on Black Friday with 62% of adults contributing towards this. This leads to a huge spike in both delivery vehicles on the road, as well as waste levels from items which have been purchased for the price saving, and not for a lifetime investment. The carbon footprint caused by this increased production rises each year to cater for the hoards of bargain hunters waiting in expectation.</p>

      <p>UK fashion designer, Christopher Raeburn, is one of many seeking to encourage customers to not be fooled by the frenzy of Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Based in East London, the RÆBURN Lab is home to a variety of sustainable fashion initiatives. After graduating from London’s <a href="https://www.rca.ac.uk/">Royal College of Art</a> in 2006, Christopher Raeburn set up the fashion label in 2008. With a philosophy to fight against the rise of fast fashion, the use of surplus, waste and recycled materials is paramount to the designer. Alongside this, the brand seeks to reduce it’s carbon footprint whilst adopting green technologies and working in small batch production formats. Their statement collections not only draw attention to the urgent climate crisis we face today but offer customers a fashion-forward, design-led, sustainable alternative.</p>
      <p>His brand, <a href="https://www.raeburndesign.co.uk/explore/about">RÆBURN</a>, is running an initiative which hopes to instil an opposing mindset to that of Black Friday; one of restoration and repair. Launching a campaign titled, ‘BUY NOTHING, RÆPAIR SOMETHING’ they continue to be strong advocates of a slow-fashion movement. The campaign is part of their wider initiative: ‘RÆMADE, RÆDUCED, RÆCYCLED’, driving against overconsumption and encouraging the use of recycled materials with a restorative outlook to fashion.</p>

      <p>“It’s our observation that Black Friday can lead to a sales culture which is getting more competitive, aggressive and wasteful by the year.” states Raeburn, “This leads to an enormous pressure on prices and production, as well as growing consumer expectation of more for less. There’s an unacceptable volume of overproduction and overconsumption, and we need to be radical in addressing this.” Next Friday, all RÆBURN stores will be closed to customers. Alternatively, they will be opening the doors to the RÆBURN Lab where visitors can bring garments, from any brand, to be altered or repaired giving them a regenerated lifespan. Seamstresses will be on hand, free of charge, to help and assist in the conservation of clothing to drive against the replacement of these items.</p>
      <p>Whilst he is optimistic that this is a positive step, Raeburn says more brands need to join the momentum. “What we are encouraging with our ‘Buy Nothing, Repair Something’ campaign this year, is that one of the most positive things we can do is keep our clothing in use for as long as possible.” he continues, “It’s promising to see so many standing for this together, but we do need more brands joining this stance in order to drive change.”</p>
      <p>The brand also hosts a number of community-focused events including Off-Cut Animal Workshops where they teach people how to sew, and participants make their own mascots using off-cuts from the studio with all proceeds from the event going to the World Wide Fund For Nature (<a href="https://www.wwf.org.uk/">WWF</a>).</p>

      <p>The bid for a sustainable industry lies with both consumers and brands simultaneously. While brands have the huge responsibility of resolving this problem, it’s also up to the customers to keep asking the right questions and being increasingly curious. “I think the responsibility lies with both designers and consumers.” Raeburn agrees. “For the consumer, it’s about making considered choices and buying less but better. Alongside this, designers ultimately need to provide a desirable, sustainable product at a competitive price. And this is the challenge that many designers face.”</p>

      <p>Looking forward to the future, Raeburn feels optimistic about changing the fashion industry. “We’re in a brilliant time for the industry as change is truly starting to take place, and the innovation that is happening around responsible design is ground-breaking.” He comments. “Remaining optimistic and driven by that momentum is key. To now be operating the business in the way we do at RÆBURN, where we are specifically trying to push innovation forward in a modern way, is really exciting. Our communications hopefully evidence this sentiment, and our community want to be part of that. Ultimately, it’s vital to work together as a whole on moving things forward.”</p>
      <p>With this continual positive disruption of the industry, RÆBURN, alongside many others, are leading the way to a brighter future for fashion and, in making a strong stance against events like Black Friday, they echo the voices of a society who are becoming aware that this over-consumption has to stop in order for the planet to survive and hopefully, in the future, begin again to thrive.</p>
