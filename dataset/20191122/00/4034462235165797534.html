      <h1>Chrysler Has Made HOW MANY Minivans?!</h1>
      <h2>More than any other automaker, to say the least.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:40:33+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:40</time> by <a rel="author">Noah Joseph</a></address>
      <p>Minivans may not be as popular as they used to be, but Fiat Chrysler Automobiles still sells them hand over proverbial fist. Now 35 years since the first Plymouth Voyager rolled off the line in Windsor, it's sold a massive number of them.</p>
      <p>15 million, to be specific, spread out over six generations. That includes the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/dodge/grand-caravan">Dodge (Grand) Caravan</a>, Plymouth (Grand) Voyager, and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chrysler/pacifica">Chrysler Pacifica</a>, Voyager, and Town &amp; Country – not to mention all the other badges under which they've been sold, including the Lancia Voyager, Ram Cargo Van, and Volkswagen Routan.</p>

      <p>Today FCA enjoys a massive 54-percent market share in the minivan segment, and that's hardly a new development. Over the 35 years since the Chrysler Corporation (as it was known at the time) introduced the first models, the company headquartered in Auburn Hills has been the top-selling manufacturer of minivans every single year, without fail.</p>
      <p>What's more, we gather, is that those numbers don't even include the Fiat side of the equation, producing models like the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/fiat/500l">500L</a> and Multipla – or the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/dodge/journey">Dodge Journey</a> (which is billed as a crossover), or any of Ram's vans (like the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ram/promaster-cargo-van">ProMaster</a> and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ram/promaster-city-wagon">ProMaster City</a>).</p>

      <p>To wrap your head around that almost unfathomable number of 15 million, consider that – with so many made with so many seats – the combined fleet of every Chrysler minivan sold to date would be enough to transport the entire populations of 100 countries (more than half of the 193 member-states in the United Nations). And based on the length of the current Dodge Grand Caravan, if you parked every one of those minivans made from end to end, they'd just about stretch across the United States, and not just the contiguous ones, either: from Florida to Alaska, or from New York to Los Angeles...and almost all the way to Hawaii.</p>
