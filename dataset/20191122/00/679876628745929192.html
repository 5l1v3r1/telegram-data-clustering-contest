      <h1>Budget (airline) wedding: Couple gets married on Jetstar flight</h1>

      <p>When a trans-Tasman couple couldn't decide on where to get married, they came up with an innovative compromise, tying the knot on a flight midway across the ditch. </p>
      <p>Kiwi Cathy Valliant met her now-husband David, an Australian, playing a game called Airport City online. </p>
      <p>"Our love of aviation is what brought us together," she says. "We chatted for more than a year and then I got up the courage to call him for his birthday and sing him happy birthday. It just evolved from there."</p>

        <figcaption>The couple bonded over their love of aviation. </figcaption>

      <p>They first met in person in 2013 when Cathy made her first trip to Australia and, she says, it was literally love at first sight. </p>
      <p>"We locked eyes and that was it!" </p>
      <p>David planned to propose on a flight from Brisbane to Melbourne some three years later, but his nerves got the better of him, and so he waited until they were alone in the evening instead. </p>
      <p>Cathy says they wanted their wedding to "symbolise our love for aviation, our love for Australia and New Zealand and our love for each other. I thought: I'll be cheeky and ask Jetstar.  Without telling Dave, I posted on Jetstar's Facebook page with the ask."</p>
      <p>Fortunately, the airline came to the party, arranging for the couple and their wedding party to sit at the front of a flight from Sydney to Auckland. </p>
      <p>Jetstar employee Robyn Holt, who is also a marriage celebrant, wed the couple at 37,000 feet (10,000 metres) above the Tasman Sea. The marriage will be legally recognised in Australia.</p>
      <p>One has to wonder though: Is the entire wedding party accompanying the couple on their honeymoon? </p>
      <p>"It was the most amazing experience and something we will remember for the rest of our lives," Cathy says. </p>
      <p>"I wish I'd met David 25 years ago. I feel our lives really started when we met... We definitely love planes. We even have a rule that whoever sees the first commercial flight on any day doesn't cook!"</p>
