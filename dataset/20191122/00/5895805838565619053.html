      <p>A Canadian <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881119882806">study</a> recently reported in the <i>Journal of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/psychopharmacology">Psychopharmacology</a></i> cites evidence that <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/cannabismarijuana">cannabis</a> use reduces the effect of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder">PTSD</a> on major <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression">depression</a> and suicide ideation (SI) among survivors who do not suffer from cannabis use disorder (CUD).</p>
      <p>Given the prevalence of PTSD, this finding has relevance for a large number of people.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/common/common_adults.asp">US Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for PTSD</a>, about 6 in every 10 men and 5 in every 10 women experience at least one <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/trauma">traumatic</a> experience in their lifetime.</p>
      <p>Women are more likely to experience sexual assault and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/child-abuse">child sexual abuse</a> than men. Men are more likely to experience accidents, physical assault, combat, or disaster, or to witness death or injury.</p>
      <p>With 9.2% of its population estimated to be affected (Lake et at., 2019) Canada has an even higher incidence of PTSD.<br/><br/>PTSD increases the risk of depression and suicide. Survivors living with PTSD frequently use cannabis to treat associated symptoms. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/addiction">Substance abuse</a>, cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) are common among trauma survivors. It has been suggested that cannabis is used as a numbing agent to manage the aftermath of trauma.</p>
      <p>But at least one previous study found that, In the long-run, cannabis use aggravates PTSD symptoms (Lake et at., 2019).</p>
      <p>The recently reported study analyzed data from a sample of 24,089 people who participated in a cross-sectional survey from 2012. This study explored whether cannabis use modifies the effects of PTSD on major depression and suicide ideation (SI).</p>
      <p>The authors measured the relationship between having PTSD and recently experiencing a major depressive episode or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/suicide">suicidal</a> ideation. They conducted a sub-analysis of 420 respondents with PTSD to examine the adjusted odds of SI and major depression according to levels of cannabis use.</p>
      <p>Participants were categorized into three levels, according to their cannabis use: low-risk, high-risk, and one-time use (non-users). Low-risk users were defined as those unlikely to develop cannabis use disorder (CUD). High-risk users were defined as those who had experienced cannabis use, disorder (CUD) in the year prior to the survey.<br/><br/>The data indicate that low-risk cannabis users are less likely to develop a major depressive episode or suicide ideation than non-users (one-time users). However, high-risk users were at increased risk of both major depression and SI. The authors suggest that there may be a higher number of high-risk users reporting symptoms because “high-risk use is a marker of unhealthy avoidance in this sub-set” (Lake et al., 2019). In other words, high-risk users are more likely to have unhealthy patterns of seeking ways to numb out and avoid dealing with the aftermath of PTSD.</p>
      <p>The authors of the study acknowledge several limitations. These include the fact that they performed a secondary analysis of data collected by another agency. They also pointed out that many outcomes in their data were self-reported and that this can impact accuracy.</p>
      <p>Lastly, they point to the fact that it is difficult to draw causal interpretations from these results. The authors call for future studies to investigate the prospects for cannabis-based therapies to mitigate PTSD symptoms while taking into consideration the risks involved.</p>
