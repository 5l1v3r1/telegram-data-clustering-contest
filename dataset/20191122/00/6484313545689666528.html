      <h1>TSB customers left without wages as payments to 1,000s of accounts delayed</h1>

        <b>Payments into thousands of TSB accounts were delayed overnight in another major banking failure, leaving some customers without wages or cash.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Update 12pm 22 November: TSB says the issue has now been fixed, and that all delayed payments have now been completed. </i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>We've heard from a number of TSB customers whose wages were delayed as a result of the issues, leaving them overdrawn or struggling to pay for essentials. Some also reported difficulties logging into online banking. </p>
      <p>The latest problems came just days after the publication of a report into the <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/online-tsb-banking-problems-complain/">two months of chaos experienced by TSB customers last year</a>, when an IT meltdown hit the bank's online and app services. </p>
      <p>TSB has apologised for the latest issues, saying they were due to a "processing error". It says no customers will be left out of pocket, and has confirmed that customers who went into their overdrafts as a result will be refunded any interest or charges.</p>
      <p>It said that customers' cards still worked for payments and withdrawals during the problems, and it offered emergency cash to customers who needed it. </p>

Yet another major banking failure has left people worried about their wages and how they are going to pay their bills.<br/><br/>"Even though this has been fixed quickly, this type of service is simply not good enough. My call to those who are affected by this and angry and disillusioned with their bank is to stop bitching, start switching. Right now you can get paid up to £175 to switch – and some banks which pay, including HSBC, M&amp;S and First Direct, have better customer service ratings and less of a history of IT problems."</blockquote>
      <h3>'My wages aren't in my account and bills are coming out'</h3>
      <p>We've seen a large number of complaints on social media this morning from TSB customers who haven't received wages or payments - here are just a few:</p>

      <h3>Frustrated TSB customer? Here's how to switch</h3>
      <p>If you've been affected by the payment delays and are unhappy with TSB's service, remember at the moment you can switch to another bank and be paid up to £175 to do so. Right now you can get a <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/compare-best-bank-accounts/#hsbc">free £175 with HSBC</a>, a <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/compare-best-bank-accounts/#firstdirect">free £50 and 'great' service with First Direct</a> or a <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/compare-best-bank-accounts/#mands">£100 gift card (and an extra £80 gift card after a year) with M&amp;S Bank</a>.  </p>
      <p>Your account will be switched in seven working days using the Current Account Switching Service (CASS), which will close your old account and transfer your money, direct debits and so on into the new one. For full info on switching and details of all our top picks, see our <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/compare-best-bank-accounts/">Best Bank Accounts</a> guide. </p>
      <h3>What does TSB say?</h3>
      <p>TSB hasn't revealed exactly how many customers were affected by the payment problems, but it's understood to be 1,000s.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the bank said: "Overnight some payments were delayed in and out of TSB accounts. This has now been resolved and the payments to and from customers have all been completed. We apologise for any inconvenience this has caused."</p>
