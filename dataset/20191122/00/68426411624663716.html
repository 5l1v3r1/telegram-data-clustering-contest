      <h1>At midday: TSX under pressure as pot stocks tumble</h1>

      <p>Canada’s main stock index fell on Friday, as losses in cannabis stocks countered a broader lift to sentiment from optimistic tones on trade talks from the United States and China.</p>
      <p>At midday, The S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index was down 51.85 points, or 0.31 per cent, at 16,947.18.</p>
      <p>More than half of the index’s 11 major sectors were lower. Canopy Growth was down 8 per cent, Aurora Cannabis 10 per cent, and the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF was down just over 5 per cent. The cannabis sector had rallied sharply over the past three days, so Friday’s move was likely tied to profit taking and technical trading.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones indexes were hovering near unchanged levels. Spirits were buoyed somewhat after President Donald Trump signaled an imminent trade deal with China, although the Nasdaq was weighed down by a slump in shares of Tesla after the launch of its electric pickup truck.</p>
      <p>Trump told Fox News that a trade deal with China was “potentially very close,” adding to optimism from remarks by President Xi Jinping that Beijing wanted to work out an initial agreement. Reports earlier in the week had indicated that a truce could be delayed to 2020.</p>
      <p>“The positive tone right now is because people have resigned themselves to the fact that they are not going to see a big deal anytime soon, as there are lot of little issues that are going to persist,” said Jeanette Garretty, managing director &amp; principal at Robertson Stephens Wealth Management.</p>
      <p>Global shares have retreated from near-two year highs scaled in recent weeks on hopes of a resolution to the trade war that has dented business sentiment, curtailed investment and hurt economic growth.</p>
      <p>A report on Friday said a hedge fund founded by billionaire Ray Dalio has bet more than $1 billion that stock markets around the world will fall by March.</p>
      <p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index remained on course to end the week with its first decline in seven, while the Nasdaq is eyeing its first weekly drop in eight. A largely better-than-expected corporate earnings season also contributed to the recent rally.</p>
      <p>Latest economic data underscored a resilient domestic economy, with U.S. manufacturing output accelerating in November to its fastest pace in seven months and services activity picking up more than expected.</p>
      <p>Among stocks, Nordstrom Inc jumped 8.8% after the retailer raised its 2019 forecast and reported third-quarter profit above expectations.</p>
