      <p>The men’s and women’s Kathmandu Coast to Coast champions will return to defend their titles in the 38th edition of the 243km adventure race.</p>
      <p>Dougal Allan will wear the No 1 bib for the first time, while Simone Maier will go from being the chaser to the chased after heading off four-time champion Elina Ussher to win her maiden title in 12hr 56min 36sec this year.</p>
      <p>They will race from the West Coast of the South Island to the east on February 7-8. 2020.</p>
      <p>"I knew I was coming back again even before I stood on the start line in 2019," said Allan.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old says defending his title is the goal.</p>
      <p>"I hadn’t raced the Coast to Coast for six years and I did wonder, what might happen if I go back and say come second, what would happen if I executed the race to the best of my ability and still don’t win it?</p>
      <p>"But when my feet hit the sand on New Brighton beach I kind of came out of this zone, where I realised what I was about to achieve, it was a crazy feeling.</p>
      <p>"So it definitely feels a little different this time around."</p>
      <p>Maier, who will be the elite women’s top seed, will be extremely tough to beat. After standing on top of the podium for the first time this year, the Kiwi-German also went on to create history by winning the GodZone Adventure Race as part of the first ever gender-balanced team in April.</p>
      <p>"I had a pretty amazing year. It’s taken a while, but it has been so good to get some reward for all that hard work I’ve put in over the years."</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old has been racing in China with Allan, two-time men’s champion Sam Clarke, and last year’s second place finisher Sam Manson.</p>
      <p>"That was so epic. I learnt a lot from them all, even little things like around the transitions and I think that will be good for me in the future."</p>
      <p>Maier believes she can go even faster next year.</p>
      <p>"It’ll depend on the conditions, like the flow in the river, but I have started working a lot more on my paddling and I hope to have a significant improvement in my paddle, and if that happens it could be amazing. But if I keep getting better with my paddling the result will show."</p>
      <p>Staying upright on her bike is a key goal from Maier after she came off between the mountain run and kayak leg this year, which cost her a couple of minutes.</p>
      <p>"I just need to concentrate a little more and there are a few minutes I could improve right there," she said.</p>
