      <p><b>(NEW YORK POST)</b> —  Shocking surveillance video captures the moment a man pulls a gun on a homeless Rio de Janeiro woman before shooting her dead — all because she asked him for the equivalent of 23 cents.</p>
      <p>The cold-blooded scene, aired Wednesday on Rede-TV in Brazil, shows homeless beggar Zilda Henrique, 31, approaching the man on Rua Barao de Amazonas in central Rio on Saturday and engaging him as he walks by, reportedly asking for 1 real, which is worth less than a US quarter.</p>
      <p>The man keeps walking but Henrique, known to locals as Neia, continues to follow him, video shows.</p>
      <p>The man, later identified as Aderbal Ramos, stops, pulls a handgun from his waistband and shoots Henrique at least twice as she turns and tries to flee across the street.</p>
      <p>She falls in the middle of the roadway, as Ramos tucks the gun back in his belt and walks away.</p>
      <p>A passerby is then approaching Henrique in the middle of the street.</p>
      <p>She was rushed to Azevedo Lima State Hospital, where she was pronounced dead, Rede-TV said.</p>
      <p>Ramos was taken into custody and was being held at the Niteroi Police Station, according to the station.</p>
