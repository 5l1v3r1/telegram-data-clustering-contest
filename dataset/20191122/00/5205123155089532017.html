        <b>AROUND nine in 10 women murdered in Ireland are killed by people they know, according to the latest research.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Women's Aid released the report, '<i>A Legacy of Loss - Femicide Watch 2019</i>,' on Friday, and among a number of significant findings, it showed that 87% of murdered Irish women knew their killer.</p>
      <p>According to the report, 230 women have died violently between 1996-2019, five of which occurred within the last year.</p>
      <p>The report centres around the notion of 'Femicide', loosely defined as when women or girls are murdered at the hands of men.</p>
      <p>141 (61%) of those woman have died in their own homes, meaning that women are more likely to be killed in their homes than any other location, while it's deemed that just over 1 in 2 (56%) femicide victims are killed by a current or former intimate male partner.</p>
      <p>According to Women's Aid, this "fits a global pattern and is in stark contrast to male homicide victims, the majority of whom are killed by strangers".</p>
      <p>The study also found that in almost every single case of murder-suicide (21 out of 22), the killer was the woman's partner, while in the 20 cases where a woman had been killed by a male relative, 16 were killed by their sons.</p>
      <p>While victims of femicide can be of any age, over half (51%) of woman killed in Ireland are under the age of 35, according to statistics.</p>
      <p>"While reiterating that one death is one too many, it is important to note that the numbers of women murdered appear to be reducing - certainly in the last decade compared to the decade prior to that," said Women's Aid CEO Sarah Benson.</p>
      <p>"We may not have a clear way to definitively determine causal factors, but it is important to reflect on what might we already be doing better now that we were 20 years ago?</p>
      <p>"What can we take encouragement from? What can we build on? In recent years we have opened up the public discussion about domestic abuse, which I hope has reduced the serious stigma victim survivors feel, and encouraged more to seek support and speak out."</p>
