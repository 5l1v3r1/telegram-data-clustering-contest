      <p>Project xCloud's CVP Kareem Choudhry says the company is “in early talks” with first- and third-party studios to create platform exclusives for its in-preview game streaming service Project xCloud, though any announcements or actual projects could be years down the line.</p>
      <p>The comment was one of many given during an X019 interview <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/xcloud-exclusive-games/">shared by Stevivor</a>, though Choudhry said that the branch’s current priority is ensuring developers are able to bring existing Xbox games to the streaming side of the fence as easily as possible.</p>
      <p>“In terms of [Project xCloud] exclusives, we’re in early talks with first- and third- parties, but we don’t have any announcements to share,” said Choudhry. “New content and IP takes eighteen months to two years [to develop].”</p>
      <p>That ease of bringing existing Xbox One games to the Project xCloud’s catalog is a concept Microsoft has led with since the get-go. Elaborating on exactly how that will work for game makers, Choudry explains that API have already been added to the Xbox SDK with stream-focused functionality, allowing games to detect when they’re being streamed and make changes to UI or networking code to accommodate any differing needs.</p>
      <p><b>Update: </b>An Xbox spokesperson told Gamasutra that the company's xCloud development currently revolves around serving its core console business, and there are currently "no plans" for cloud-exclusive content: "We’re very early in the multi-year journey for Project xCloud, which is currently in public preview. We are investigating a variety of new capabilities made possible by the cloud. However, we remain committed to an approach with game streaming that is complementary to console and have no plans for cloud-exclusive content at this time."</p>
