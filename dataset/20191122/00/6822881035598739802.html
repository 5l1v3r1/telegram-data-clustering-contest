        <b>Wealthtech start-up Wealthinity has launched to help smaller wealth managers compete with big firms by providing a web-based portfolio portal which it says can service clients in just 15 minutes.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Small to medium-sized financial advisors, wealth managers and private banks can partner with the start-up to offer customised investment solutions under their own brands (i.e. white label) “without any additional costs”.</p>
      <p>The start-up is a spinoff of Westminster-headquartered Fusion Group, an institutional asset manager which now deals with high net worth and retail clients.</p>

      <p>“In recent years, an increasing number of smaller wealth management and financial advisory firms have struggled with growth, due to failing to compete with larger financial institutions,” says Wealthinity’s co-founder, Taras Rybak.</p>
      <p>“This is because they lack the same capabilities, ranging from in-house investment expertise, research and technology through to having a clear understanding of complex investment products together with access to a wide range of trading counterparties.”</p>
      <p>Rybak says that by helping these smaller firms with portfolio construction, they can offer a more attractive service to clients which tackles the stagnation in growth many are currently experiencing.</p>
