      <p>Sunday night will see the 9-1 San Francisco 49ers host the 8-2 Green Bay Packers at Levi’s Stadium in one of the most-anticipated games on the NFL calendar. This matchup was just recently flexed to “Sunday Night Football,” meaning that the powers to be expect it to be great. With a win over Green Bay in Week 12, the 49ers can pretty much eliminate another competitor for home-field advantage throughout the NFC Playoffs. A loss would push Kyle Shanahan and Co. back to a pack that includes Green Bay, New Orleans, Seattle and Minnesota.</p>
      <p>It’s also the first of a three-game span for the 49ers against fellow Super Bowl contenders. Needless to say, it’s absolutely huge for both teams.</p>
      <p>Here, we preview this game by giving you the top stories to watch, the top matchups and a final prediction for the Packers-49ers Week 12 game. And for the first time in this series, we check in on the highly-competitive NFC Playoff race.</p>
      <h4>Time: 8:20 PM ET</h4>
      <h4>Television: NBC</h4>
      <h4>Spread: 49ers (-3)</h4>
      <h4>Over/Under: 45.5</h4>
      <h3>Aaron Rodgers Vs Jimmy Garoppolo</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>This is not a specific matchup by the pure definition, but whoever comes out on top between the two will almost certainly lead his team to a win. In terms of what we’ve seen recently, they have both been pretty good. Check out their splits over the past four games.</p>
      <p>Garoppolo: 69.3% completion, 1,164 yards, 11 TD, 4 INT</p>
      <p>Rodgers: 68.8% completion, 1,128 yards, 9 TD, 0 INT</p>
      <p>It’s a key part of a game that will go a long way in determining who has a first-round bye in the playoffs and home-field advantage once January comes calling.</p>
      <h4>The Deebo Samuel Dynamic</h4>
      <p>With Kittle sidelined for the past two games, this rookie receiver stepped up big time. Samuel has caught 16-of-21 targets for 246 yards during that span. While Samuel did suffer a shoulder injury in Sunday’s win, the expectation is that he’ll be able to go against Green Bay. He did finish the game. That’s no small thing.</p>
      <p>Taking on a Packers defense that’s given up 276 passing yards per game, Samuel would have a plus-level matchup if he were to suit up. With Dante Pettis clearly in the dog house and Emmanuel Sanders banged up, it’s something the 49ers will need.</p>
      <h4>Getting Reinforcements Back</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>There’s a decent chance that George Kittle will return after missing the past two games with injuries to both his ankle and knee. While the Pro Bowl tight end is questionable to go, the game against Green Bay was always his target date for a return. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vincentfrank/2019/11/21/george-kittle-returns-to-practice-and-other-49ers-notes-ahead-of-packers-game/">Returning to practice on Thursday</a> helps matters in this regard.</p>
      <p>We’re also expecting reserve linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair to return after missing Week 11 with a concussion. His injury left the 49ers with only four healthy linebackers against Arizona. The status of rising defensive tackle D.J. Jones also looks good. He practiced in full this week and should be a go. That’s no small thing against talented young Packers running back Aaron Jones.</p>
      <h4>Making That Statement</h4>
      <p>Despite their 9-1 record, the 49ers have yet to make that statement on national television. A win against the Los Angeles Rams earlier in the season came on a regional broadcast. And while some expected the Cleveland Browns to be good, San Francisco’s blowout win over that struggling team back in Week 5 can’t qualify as a statement win.</p>
      <p>The last time a national audience saw these 49ers in action they <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vincentfrank/2019/11/12/nfl-week-10-takeaways-from-49ers-overtime-loss-to-the-seahawks/">dropped a heartbreaker</a> against the Seattle Seahawks in overtime back in Week 10. With two of their next four games in front of a national audience, the 49ers have a chance to make a real statement here. It includes proving that the NFC is theirs for the taking.</p>
      <h3>Top Matchups</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Davante Adams vs Ahkello Witherspoon</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Witherspoon came into the game on Sunday for the first time since Week 3 after Emmanuel Moseley suffered a minor injury. Now completely healthy, Witherspoon had regained his starting job.</p>
      <p>This is a great problem for the 49ers. Moseley, a former undrafted free agent, has been absolutely stellar this season, yielding a sub 30 passer rating when targeted. For his part, Witherspoon gave up a 10.0 passer rating when he played over the first two-plus games.</p>
      <p>This is a strength versus strength matchup here. Adams remains Aaron Rodgers’ top go-to guy. After returning from a multi-week absence, Adams has caught 14-of-21 targets for 159 yards in two games. This will help dictate the outcome of the game Sunday night.</p>
      <p>
        <b>George Kittle/Ross Dwelley vs Adrian Amos</b>
      </p>
      <p>As of right now, it looks like Kittle will return Sunday after a two-game absence. This was always the target date for the Pro Bowl tight end, who continues to deal with ankle and knee issues. Needless to say, it would be a big deal if Kittle is able to go. Despite missing those two games, he still leads the 49ers in receptions (46) and receiving yards (541). If Kittle can’t go, Dwelley will start at tight end. He caught two touchdown passes from Jimmy Garoppolo last week.</p>
      <p>On the other side sits a Packers defense that has allowed 57 receptions for 627 yards and five touchdowns to tight ends this season. It’s among the worst units in the NFL covering tight ends. Weather it is Dwelley or Kittle (or a combination of the two) on the field, Amos must step up from the free safety position.</p>
      <p>
        <b>David Bakhtiari vs Nick Bosa</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Surprisngly, Bosa has been held without a sack each of the past three games. He still ranks among the top edge rushers in quarterback pressures and hits. This three-game span has not seen him invisible in the offensive backfield. He just has not put up the sack numbers.</p>
      <p>It’s going to be somewhat difficult against one of the best left tackles the rookie has played thus far this season. According to Pro Football Focus, Bakhtiari ranks fourth among tackles in pass protection. With Dee Ford questionable to go, Bosa will take on even more importance. A lack of a pass rush against Aaron Rodgers could doom San Francisco to its second loss of the season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aaron Rodgers vs 49ers Pass Defense</b>
      </p>
      <p>Strength versus strength. We’re seeing that a lot heading into “Sunday Night Football.” It’s no more prevalent than right here. San Francisco ranks No. 1 in the NFL against the pass, yielding 142 yards per game. It has also allowed 10 touchdowns compared to 11 interceptions for a 72.3 opposing passer rating.</p>
      <p>While Rodgers has struggled at times this season (394 yards, one touchdown past two games), he’s still putting in a tremendous campaign under first-year head coach Matt LaFleur. The former NFL MVP heads into Week 12 having put up 2,718 yards with 17 touchdowns and two interceptions.</p>
      <h3>Playoff Notes</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>With one week left until Thanksgiving weekend, it makes sense to look at the NFC Playoff race as it relates to the 49ers. We’ll be doing this in the weekly preview article from here on out.</p>
      <p><b>NFC West:</b> San Francisco currently sits one game ahead of Seattle in the division, but has already lost to the Seahawks at home. With a Week 17 game looming in the Pacific Northwest, pushing this to a multi-game lead would be huge. Seattle has a difficult Week 12 test on the road against the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
      <p><b>Playoffs: </b>While it’s certainly not a goal of the 9-1 49ers to squeak into the playoff via the wild card, it’s something that we should pay attention to. If Seattle were to somehow grab the division, the 49ers have a solid backup plan. They are three games ahead of the Rams for what would be the final wild card spot with six games remaining. Given San Francisco already beat the Rams in Los Angeles, that’s technically a four-game lead. The Rams take on a red-hot Baltimore Ravens team at home Monday night. Behind Los Angeles sits the Eagles and Panthers at 5-5.</p>
      <p><b>Home-Field Advantage:</b> This should take care of itself over the final six weeks. San Francisco currently sits one game ahead of the Packers, Saints and Seahawks for home-field advantage. It plays each team over the course of the remainder of the season, starting with the Packers Sunday night. Kyle Shanahan and Co. literally control their destiny.</p>
      <h3>Prediction: 49ers 27, Packers 24</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>It’s going to be yet another tight affair at Levi’s Sunday night. I am expecting this one to go down to the wire. But as has been the case with the exception of one game this season, look for the 49ers to come out on top.</p>
      <p>More than anything, we’re confident in Garoppolo’s ability to lead a late-game surge against what has been a questionable overall Packers defense. Given that Garoppolo should have all of his top-end pass catchers Sunday night, that’s magnfieid further.</p>
      <p>With San Francisco’s defense still playing at a high level and Levi’s expected to be rocking, look for the 49ers to move to 10-1 on the season before a huge two-game road trip.</p>
