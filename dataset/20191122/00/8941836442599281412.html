      <p>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - New Mexico is extending opportunities for public comment on changes in medical marijuana regulations aimed at bolstering health protections and patient access.</p>
      <p>Winter weather and icy roads delayed the opening of a hearing Friday on proposed rule changes to requirements for testing of cannabis and cannabis-derived products for the presence of heavy metals, pesticides and potency.</p>
      <p>The state Health Department says public comment will be extended to a date in January that has yet to be determined.</p>
      <p>The proposed rules also would create cannabis consumption areas to be operated at approved dispensaries. Certain additives would be prohibited for cannabis products that are inhaled.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>That includes an additive suspected as a source of vaping-related lung injury. Packaging would change to avoid confusion between cannabis products and ordinary food or candy.</p>
