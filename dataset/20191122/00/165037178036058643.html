        <b>Ernesto Valverde spoke in a press conference, this time to analyse this weekend's game between Leganes and Barcelona, a game in which Pique and Rakitic are protagonists, by what the coach says: "I have to play the best".</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Barcelona coach made it clear with <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/g-pique-23560/">Pique</a>, whom the Davis Cup organisation may be throwing away: <b>"If I see him focused and in good condition</b>, he will play against Leganes".</p>
      <p>"I have spoken with him and I see that he is focused. He has things to do outside of football. When all the players are accused of <b>not knowing how to do anything other than play football,</b> the one who does it is criticised," he added.</p>
      <p>About <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/i-rakitic-2139">Rakitic</a>, Valverde recognised that "the team is changing a few things". "There are a lot of players in some positions. I don't plan anything as we <b>will see what the moment brings</b>. I have to play the best," he explained.</p>
      <p>He was<b> positive about the return of the internationals</b>, as he sees those as "the main ones". "There have been long trips, but not as long as on other occasions," Valverde said. </p>
      <p>A little fed up with being questioned on some subjects, such as Griezmann. "He is in November, like everyone else. <b>Sometimes I don't know what to say</b>. Everyone else is valued on the basis of their success. I see him well and we hope he is better," he said.</p>

      <p>On being questioned about Riqui Puig, the<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona"> Barcelona</a> coach was blunt and explained how the situation is: "We think that he is close to the first team, although there are a lot of players in his position<b>. There are players who are more reluctant to go out</b> because they think that it can cut their progression."</p>
      <p>On the other hand, he doesn't trust Leganés, the bottom of the standings. <b>"We're not in a position to think that our opponents are simple,"</b> he said, recalling last season's loss to the 'pepinero' team.</p>
      <p>His opponent on the bench will be Javier Aguirre, who believes he will achieve <b>"wake up Leganés." </b>"He has a way of reaching the players and bringing out the best in them...," he concluded.</p>
