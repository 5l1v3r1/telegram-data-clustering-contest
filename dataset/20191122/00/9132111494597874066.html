      <p>The Electoral Commission(EC) has on Thursday, November 21, 2019, presented a final certificate to Osofo Kyiri Abosom’s Ghana Union Movement (GUM), and the Power Unity Party (PUP) at the Commission’s head office in the capital, Accra.</p>
      <p>The move seals their participation in the upcoming 2020 elections as they join Ghana’s electoral train for a showdown next year.</p>
      <p>On September 24, 2019, the Ghana Union Movement (GUM) received its provisional certificate from the Electoral Commission (EC) to commence operations and was upbeat to break the hold the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Congress (NDC) have on the Ghanaian electorate.</p>
      <p>The party is founded by the Head Pastor and General Overseer of the Life Assembly Worship Centre in Accra, Rev Christian Kwabena Andrew.</p>
