      <p><b>(AFP) —</b> Israel’s embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was indicted on a range of corruption charges Thursday, potentially spelling an end to his decades-long political career.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit “decided to file charges against the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for offences of receiving a bribe, fraud, and breach of trust,” a justice ministry statement said.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu, who strongly denies all the charges, becomes the first Israeli prime minister to be indicted while in office.</p>
      <p>Rightwinger Netanyahu, who is nicknamed “Mr Security” and “King Bibi” and has been in power since 2009, is Israel’s longest-serving prime minister and dominates the country’s political scene.</p>
      <p>The indictment comes as Israel faces a potential third election in a year, with neither Netanyahu nor his main rival able to form a government after two deadlocked elections.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu is not legally required to resign until he is convicted and all appeals are exhausted, but political pressure is likely to be intense.</p>
      <p>A close ally of US President Donald Trump, the 70-year-old may now ask the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, to grant him immunity from prosecution.</p>
      <p>The charges against him range from receiving gifts worth thousands of dollars to a deal to change regulatory frameworks in favour of a media group in exchange for positive coverage.</p>
      <p>Mandelblit said it was a “hard and sad day” for Israel to indict a leader but it was an “important” one as it showed no Israeli was above the law.</p>
      <p>“The citizens of Israel, all of us, and myself, look up to the elected officials, and first and foremost — to the prime minister,” Mandelblit said.</p>
      <p>He said the decision had been made with a “heavy heart, but also with a whole heart.”</p>
      <p>“Law enforcement is not a choice. It is not a matter of right or left. It’s not a matter of politics.”</p>
      <p>He stressed that Netanyahu was innocent until proven guilty.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu was expected to respond later Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>The justice ministry said copies of the charge sheet had been sent to both Netanyahu’s lawyers and the Knesset.</p>
      <p>A perennial fighter, Netanyahu has outlived many political rivals and Hugh Lovatt, Israel-Palestine analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the indictment may still not be “the end of the story”.</p>
      <p>“Israel will now have to brace for a political roller-coaster ride over the coming months. Now more than ever Netanyahu will be fighting for his political and personal life.”</p>
