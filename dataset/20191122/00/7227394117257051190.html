      <h1>New Nokia smartphone launches on December 5</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=25" target="_blank">Vlad</a></address>
      <p>HMD Global, the company that makes Nokia smartphones, has started teasing its next product, which will be officially unveiled on December 5. We know this much from the tweet you can see embedded below. Unfortunately, aside from the date and an outline of a handset, we don't have any other clues as to what phone this will be.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, here's an interesting tidbit: the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_8_1_(nokia_x7)-9342.php">Nokia 8.1</a> was <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_81_announced__x7_for_the_west_its_coming_in_middecember-news-34569.php">announced on December 5</a> last year. With this in mind, we would definitely not be shocked if this time around the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_82_to_arrive_with_popup_camera_and_android_q_out_of_the_box-news-38328.php">Nokia 8.2</a> sees the light of day.</p>
      <p>Other options include the Nokia 5.2 (which has so far been missing in action), and even the Nokia 2.3 (which is only expected to be a minor improvement over the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_2_2-9731.php">2.2</a>).</p>
