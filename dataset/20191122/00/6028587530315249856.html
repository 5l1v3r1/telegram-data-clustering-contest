      <p>The San Francisco 49ers are preparing for one of the bigger games on the NFL schedule this season. At 9-1 on the year, they’ll host the 8-2 Green Bay Packers at Levi’s Stadium on “Sunday Night Football.” Mere days away from this game, the injury-plagued <a href="https://twitter.com/KeianaMartinTV/status/1197667885847437312?s=20">49ers got a ton of good news on that front</a>.</p>
      <p>Pro Bowl tight end George Kittle (knee, ankle) returned to limited practice on Thursday for the first time since suffering the injuries in San Francisco’s Week 9 win over the Arizona Cardinals. Kittle has missed each of the past two games.</p>
      <p>It’s not yet known whether Kittle will be on the field, but all signs are pointing to that happening. The team’s top pass-catcher noted following practice that he’s excited for the Green Bay challenge and is targeting a return Sunday night.</p>
      <p>“It went really well. It was definitely a great step in the right direction. It was really fun being back out there with all the guys,” Kittle said after Thursday’s practice. “I definitely don’t miss sitting in the training room all day. My goal definitely is still Green Bay.”</p>
      <p>Kittle is instrumental in San Francisco’s success on offense. That much is already known. His absence in Week 10’s loss to the Seattle Seahawks played a huge role in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vincentfrank/2019/11/12/nfl-week-10-takeaways-from-49ers-overtime-loss-to-the-seahawks/">Jimmy Garoppolo’s struggles under center</a>.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old Kittle has caught 134 passes for 1,918 yards and seven touchdowns in 24 games dating back to the start of last season.</p>
      <p>Dealing with a rib injury, the recently-acquired Emmanuel Sanders also took part in limited practice. Despite suffering said injury back in Week 10, Sanders was on the field this past Sunday. He was in and out of the game, playing just 49% of the snaps on offense and catching 3-of-5 targets for 33 yards.</p>
      <p>Sanders tallied a combined 11 catches for 137 yards and two touchdowns in his first two games with the 49ers before pulling up lame against Seattle back in Week 10.</p>
      <p>These two are more than likely ready to go for Sunday. That’s no small thing against a weak Packers pass defense that has yielded the ninth-most yards through the air in the NFL this season.</p>

      <p>Following <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vincentfrank/2019/11/18/nfl-week-11-top-takeaways-from-49ers-comeback-win-over-the-cardinals/">two consecutive breakout games</a> that has seen him tally 16 receptions for 246 yards, rookie receiver Deebo Samuel (shoulder) also returned to practice. Despite suffering said injury last week, the second-round pick was able to tough it out. He’ll be a go and in the starting lineup with Sanders when Sunday night comes calling.</p>
      <p>Reserve linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair (concussion) and defensive tackle D.J. Jones (hamstring) were full goes in practice. They both missed last week’s game. Al-Shaair’s injury left San Francisco with only four healthy linebackers. His return will be big for depth. Meanwhile, Jones is in the midst of a breakout season. His presence on the field should help offset talented young running back Aaron Jones.</p>
      <p>On to the bad news. Pro Bowlers Dee Ford (hamstring) and left tackle Joe Staley (finger) did not practice on Thursday. Neither one seems likely to play against the Packers.</p>
      <p>Ford suffered his injury last week after sacking Kyler Murray. He was pulled from the game and almost immediately ruled out for the duration. Dealing with knee injuries throughout the season, Ford has still been able to record 6.5 sacks in 10 games.</p>
      <p>Staley’s return from a previous injury was cut short Week 10 against the Seahawks. He missed this past Sunday’s game and is unlikely to go against the Packers. Rookie sixth-round pick Justin Skule will likely start his eighth game at left tackle in Staley’s stead.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, starting running back Matt Breida (ankle) is likely to miss his second consecutive game. He was also a non-participant in practice on Thursday after missing last week’s outing against the Arizona Cardinals.</p>
      <p>What does this all mean? For the most part, Thursday’s injury report was pretty darn good for the 49ers. Garoppolo will need his three favorite pass-catchers on the field to dispose of an eight-win Packers team on Sunday. Reinforcements are defense will help against Aaron Rodgers and Co.</p>
      <h3>Other Notes</h3>
      <p>It’s looking more and more like Jalen Hurd (back) and Trent Taylor (foot) will miss the entire season. Both are on injured reserve and are unlikely to be designated for return.</p>
      <p>Instead, look for the 49ers to bring back defensive tackle Kentavius Street and corner Jason Verrett from the injured list. Whether either player has a role on that side of the ball moving forward remains to be seen.</p>

      <p>Ahkello Witherspoon will get his first start opposite Richard Sherman since Week 3. The third-year cornerback returned in limited action last week, but Emmanuel Moseley remained the starter. Witherspoon, who has yielded a sub 10.0 passer rating on the season, will be thrown right into the fire against Davante Adams.</p>
      <p>Sunday night’s game against Green Bay is the start of the toughest three-game span in the history of the NFL. It is followed by road dates against the Ravens and Saints. Combined, these three squads boast a 24-6 record.</p>
