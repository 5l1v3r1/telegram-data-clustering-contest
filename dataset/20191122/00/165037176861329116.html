        <b>Chelsea boss Frank Lampard says he will never follow Jose Mourinho's lead and manage London rivals Tottenham.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile Andre Villas-Boas, who coached both clubs, called the partnership between<b> Mourinho and Spurs chairman Daniel Levy</b> an <b>"unusual marriage".</b></p>
      <p><b>Mauricio Pochettino was sacked</b> this week and two-time Chelsea boss <b>Mourinho jumped straight into the hot seat</b> at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
      <p>When asked if he could ever envisage managing the north London outfit<b>, Lampard replied: "I can firmly say 'no'</b>, and you can replay that again in 10 years. It wouldn't happen but <b>I think things are different for me."</b></p>
      <p>Lampard, who played under Mourinho at Stamford Bridge, added: "I was here for 13 years as a player and<b> have an absolutely deep feeling for a club".</b></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/chelsea-fc">"Chelsea</a> is certainly so close to my heart,<b> hence why I am so proud to manage the club </b>and why I wouldn't manage Tottenham".</p>
      <p><b>"That's no disrespect to anyone</b>, it's just because of what Chelsea has given me over my time as a player and now, it's certainly not on my list."</p>
      <p>Asked if he was surprised Mourinho took the helm at <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a>, Lampard said: "That's only his decision, and you make that decision as you go".</p>
      <p>"He's managed a lot of football clubs and that's what happens. If fans judge you that's out of your hands.<b> As a professional you have to understand the right to work."</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>- Winner Mourinho -</b>
      </p>
      <p>Marseille boss <b>Villas-Boas</b> also expressed reservations about his mentor Mourinho working for Levy.</p>

      <p><b>"They are two characters,"</b> he said. "I don't think it will work very well, but if a coach in the world can make Tottenham win, it is Jose,<b> wherever he has gone he has won."</b></p>
      <p>"He goes to a club and his owner whom I know well," said Villas-Boas.</p>
      <p>"So yes, it's short-term, but <b>it's contrary to Tottenham's philosophy. It's expensive</b>. For Levy, all men are numbers, but with Jose, they're high numbers..."</p>
      <p>Villas-Boas worked as an assistant to Mourinho at Porto and then Inter Milan and said he was <b>"very happy" </b>his former boss was coaching again because he<b> "cannot go 11 months without a club.</b> Some take a sabbatical year, like me, but with Jose that's not the case".</p>
      <p><b>"Jose is obsessed with football</b>, I hope he will enjoy this special club."</p>
      <p>Lampard revealed he <b>had sent Mourinho a good-luck message.</b></p>
      <p>"We had a couple of messages just to wish him well in his new role as he has always done for me," the 41-year-old said.</p>
      <p><b>"I think history and results speak for themselves </b>-- the trophies, titles he's managed to win at clubs, they are not surprises, <b>they are for the hard work he's put in. </b>He's done that consistently."</p>
      <p>For Chelsea's visit to champions Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday,<b> Christian Pulisic is in contention, </b>having returned to full training after a groin problem.</p>
      <p><b>Callum Hudson-Odoi</b> has a hamstring issue and is a long-shot to face Pep Guardiola's side.</p>
