        <b>Mauricio Pochettino's goodbye from Tottenham has immediately started the rumours about his arrival at Bayern Munich. His possible hiring by the Bavarian team would be good news for Barcelona, as it could be key to the definitive purchase of Coutinho by the German team.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Pochettino</b> has been the talking point (as well as <b>Mourinho</b>) in the last few days. His <b>sacking from Tottenham</b> has caused a big shake up in the football world!</p>
      <p>Since he said goodbye to the London club, the rumours have started about<b> his possible spell at</b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/bayern-munchen/"> Bayern Munich</a>, something that would also affect <b>Barcelona.</b></p>
      <p>If the German team signed the Argentine it would<b> have a direct affect on <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona">Barcelona</a> in regards to </b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/p-coutinho-65113">Philippe Coutinho</a><b> </b>and a potential definite stay at Bayern.</p>

      <p>Pochettino already wanted to Brazilian at <b>Tottenham</b> this summer, but in the end<b> they could not sign him</b>.</p>
      <p>Now, if he signs for Bayern, the coach could count on Coutinho in his squad.<b> A footballer who is to his liking and who he would hardly let escape,</b> so the chances that Bayern make their option to buy for Coutinho count would grow.</p>
      <p>It should be remembered that Pochettino already had the player during his brief stageÂ in <b>Espanyol </b>during the 2011/12 season.</p>
