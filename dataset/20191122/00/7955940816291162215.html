      <p>The annual Garda clamp down on drink and drug driving for the Christmas and New Year period begins on Friday next week. </p>
      <p>There will be a network of Garda checkpoints and extra patrols across Co Kildare. </p>
      <p>Last year over 1,000 nationwide drivers were arrested for alcohol or drug driving.</p>
      <p>Gardaí are expected to target roads around rural towns and villages, as well as having early evening, night and 'morning after' check points.</p>
      <p>Gardai will also be operating checkpoints on Christmas Day.</p>
      <p>Figures released earlier this year showed there is an increasing number of motorists found over the limit at 'morning after' checkpoints between 6am and midday.</p>
      <p>According to Garda figures for 2019 so far, over 6,500 drivers were already arrested up to the end of September for alcohol or drug driving</p>
      <p>Many are detected multiple times over the legal limit.</p>
      <p>Some 60% of the motorists are between the ages 20 and 40.</p>
