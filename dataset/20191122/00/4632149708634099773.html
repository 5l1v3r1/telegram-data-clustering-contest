      <h1>United Spirits’ happy tidings from High Court</h1>

      <p><i>No, it is not about Vijay Mallya. Liquor buyer, who was absolved of payment, asked to pay Rs 53 lakh</i> <br/><br/>Finally, there is some good news for United Spirits from the High Court. However, the news is not about Vijay Mallya or Kingfisher Airlines. It is a modest victory about a liquor buyer, who has been asked to pay a modest Rs 53 lakh after being absolved by a lower court. But it is still good news for the beleaguered company. <br/><br/>United Spirits Limted (USL) had filed the appeal before a division bench of the High Court in 2014 against G Mohan, an Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) licensee and managing director of Kerala Hotel Private Ltd. USL’s suit for recovery of Rs 53,79,100 from Mohan had been rejected by a Judicial Magistrate First Class court in Hospet, Ballari. That is how the appeal came to be filed before the HC. <br/><br/>Mohan was purchasing IMFL from USL on a credit basis since November 1994 and making payments for the same. In August and December of 1995 he had placed purchase orders for 5,850 cases of IMFL. USL supplied it under nine different invoices. The payments for these were not made and USL issued legal notice in December 1997. An amount of Rs 53,79,100 was due. <br/><br/>Mohan was required to furnish ‘C forms’ as the liquor was sold by him in Andaman and Nicobar and in respect of inter-state sale these forms were required for USL to pay taxes. In the lower court, Mohan claimed that there was confusion due to fake permits. The Deputy Commissioner of Excise Department of Andaman and Nicobar initiated an enquiry against Mohan. The ‘C forms’ were not sent to USL as criminal case was pending and the officials of Andaman and Nicobar were investigating the matter. <br/><br/>USL had argued that “on account of criminal prosecution, the defendant cannot seek exemption from the civil liability.” The lower court had however ruled in favour of Mohan. It held that the invoices which were produced by USL are subject matter of investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and USL had failed to prove that the consignment has ben received by Mohan. <br/><br/>The HC however pointed out that the defendant had himself accepted that USL had supplied the goods as per the purchase order. “The Trial Court ought to have appreciated that merely because criminal case is pending, the defendant cannot escape its civil liability as the suit was required to be decided on the basis of evidence adduced before the Trial Court by the parties.” <br/><br/>Ordering Mohan to pay up the dues with 12 per cent interest, the HC said, “The Trial Court in the state of evidence on record erred in holding that the plaintiff has not been able to prove that it has supplied the consignment under the purchase orders.”</p>
