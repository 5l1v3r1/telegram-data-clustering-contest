      <p>Founder and CEO CJ Lemsky explains that her company’s name Oojra, is a creative combination of the Hindi word for energy “urja” and the feel-good sound people make when in tasting/touching/smelling something delightful...”oooou”. Much of her “scentspiration” stems from her love for travel, design and commitment to natural health. In fact, one of her earliest diffuser creations stemmed from a trip to Thailand - the <a href="https://shop.oojra.com/collections/reed-diffusers/products/thai-jasmine-bamboo-essential-oil-reed-diffuser">Thai Jasmine Bamboo Essential Oil Reed Diffuser</a>. The aroma transports you to Thai spa in Hua Hin and you’re engulfed in uplifting jasmine flowers and the verdant retreat of a rainforest. As one of their most popular sellers, this aromatherapy of jasmine and bamboo creates an atmosphere of happy relaxation. The company prides itself upon use of 100% natural fragrance oils that are derived from extracts and botanicals. There are no synthetics, no parabens and no phthalates in their oil blends; and as a result, scents offer greater fragrance depth compared with the artificial variety. Diffusers also use natural rattan reeds and the glass vessels and gift boxes can be reused and/or recycled.</p>
