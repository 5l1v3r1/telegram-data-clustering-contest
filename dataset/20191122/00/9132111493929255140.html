      <p>The ongoing national identification registration programme in the Bono East Region has been hijacked by members of the ruling NPP administration, that is a statement coming from Bilal Muazu Sulemana; Regional Youth Organizer of NDC- Bono East.</p>
      <p>In a press release made available to Ghanaweb.com, he explained that the NPP had set a selfish recruitment scheme, hiring the services of only party members. This, Bilal Muazu Sulemana believes must be brought to the attention of stakeholders for possible measures taken to address the situation.</p>
      <p>In his own words “it is a fact worth sharing that the all-important national identification registration programme which started in the Bono East Region about a week ago has been hijacked by the ruling NPP administration recruiting her apparatchiks to serve their selfish, self-seeking, parochial partisan agenda. We the members of the Bono East Regional Youth Wing of the NDC have been following the ongoing N.I.A. registration programme since it started in our beloved region- Bono East and we wish to make our observations public to all stakeholders for the necessary precautional measures to be taken.”</p>
      <p>He also indicated that the NPP party faithful manning the registration process is making the exercise fall short of diligence. According to him, recruiters guarantee for party members who do not have birth certificates, driver’s license and other requirements that qualify an individual to be registered for the N.l.A. card.</p>
      <p>The NDC regional organizer also laments that “there is a deliberate attempt to disallow our brothers and sisters from the Zongo Communities from taking part in this all-important exercise. These NPP APPARATCHIKS operating with the N.I.A. tags any person with a Zongo assent or wearing 'jalabab' (long lslamic robe) or putting on 'hijab'(veil) as a Malian,Nigerian, Burkinabey thereby asking them intimidating and unwarranted questions and finally disqualifying them from taking part in the registration exercise”.</p>
      <p>The aggrieved youth in the Bono East are however, demanding for an extension of the registration exercise to allow people affected by the hijack be able to register.</p>
