      <p><b>Topline:</b> Following the news earlier this week that a phase one deal between China and the U.S. won’t be completed until next year, the leaders of both countries on Friday reiterated their desire to defuse the 16-month-long trade war, giving a boost to the stock market.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>After Trump and Xi’s comments, the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.17% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 0.39%, which helped pare back losses from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/20/stocks-fall-on-reports-that-us-china-trade-deal-delayed-until-2020/#51a1a61754f1">reports</a> earlier in the week that a phase one deal won’t be signed this year.</li>
        <li>Speaking on <i>Fox and Friends</i>, President Donald Trump was optimistic about ongoing negotiations, saying that a phase one trade deal with China is “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/trump-says-trade-deal-with-china-is-very-close.html">very close</a>” to getting signed.</li>
        <li>Making his own rare comments on the trade war, Chinese President Xi Jinping <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/trump-xi-send-positive-signals-on-initial-deal-to-defuse-u-s-china-trade-war-idUSKBN1XW0FP">said</a> that Beijing wants to work out an interim deal “on the basis of mutual respect and equality.”</li>
        <li>“When necessary we will fight back, but we have been working actively to try not to have a trade war,” Xi <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/trump-xi-send-positive-signals-on-initial-deal-to-defuse-u-s-china-trade-war-idUSKBN1XW0FP">said</a>. “We did not initiate this trade war, and this is not something we want.”</li>
        <li>Later in the day, Trump <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/trump-says-trade-deal-with-china-is-very-close.html">responded</a> to Xi’s comments, telling Fox that he didn’t like the Chinese President’s insistence on “equality” and adding that “this can’t be like an even deal.” </li>
        <li>While both sides said they want to work out a deal, Trump said he is “not anxious” to sign one because the U.S. can continue to benefit from tariffs on Chinese imports, he claimed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Tangent:</b> Hong Kong has recently emerged as another point of contention between the U.S. and China, which could complicate a deal. The Senate <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/20/us-senate-passes-hong-kong-rights-bill-sending-legislation-to-house.html">recently passed a bill</a> to support protestors there, resulting in China <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/20/hong-kong-protests-beijing-condemns-bills-accuses-us-of-interference.html">accusing</a> the U.S. of interfering in its domestic affairs. Trump claimed in the interview on <i>Fox and Friends</i> that “thousands of people would have been killed in Hong Kong” if not for him.”</p>
      <p>That’s because Chinese President Xi wouldn’t want to ruin the ongoing trade talks, Trump said, also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/trump-says-trade-deal-with-china-is-very-close.html">arguing</a> that “if it weren’t for me, Hong Kong would have been obliterated in 14 minutes.” As the months of discord in Hong Kong continue, it now remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will adopt a hard-line stance in support of protestors. When asked if he planned to sign the bill in support of Hong Kong, Trump was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/trump-xi-send-positive-signals-on-initial-deal-to-defuse-u-s-china-trade-war-idUSKBN1XW0FP">unclear</a>: “We have stand with Hong Kong, but I’m also standing with President Xi.”</p>
      <p><b>Crucial background: </b>Trade talks have stalled recently, as the signing of an agreed-upon phase one deal has gotten repeatedly delayed. Negotiations have become increasingly more complicated: The Chinese are resisting calls to double agricultural imports from the U.S., while Trump is reluctant to pull back on tariffs. In fact, Trump <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/19/trump-threatens-higher-tariffs-if-china-doesnt-make-a-trade-deal.html">threatened</a> on Tuesday to raise tariffs on China if negotiations continue to stall: “If we don’t make a deal with China, I’ll just raise the tariffs even higher.” The next round of tariffs are scheduled to kick in on $156 billion worth of Chinsese goods starting December 15. </p>
      <p><b>Crucial quote: </b>“The bottom line is, we have a very good chance to make a deal,” Trump said on <i>Fox and Friends</i>.</p>
