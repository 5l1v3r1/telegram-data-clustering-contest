      <h1>Japan's factory output, retail sales likely slumped as tax hike bites</h1>

      <p>TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output and retail sales are expected to have slumped in October, a Reuters poll showed, as slowing global demand and a sales tax hike introduced in the month hurt exports and private consumption.</p>
      <p>The slew of data is likely to underscore the fragile state of Japan's economic recovery and keep policymakers under pressure to unveil more measures to prop up growth.</p>
      <p>Industrial production is expected to fall 2.1% in October after a 1.7% gain in September, a poll of 18 economists showed, as sluggish exports and the hit to domestic demand from the sales tax hike took a toll on factory activity.</p>
      <p>"Given the pent-up demand that occurred in September ahead of the tax hike, a downturn in October is inevitable," said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.</p>
      <p>A huge typhoon that caused heavy rain and flooding during the month also likely disrupted factory output, analysts say.</p>
      <p>Separate data is expected to show that retail sales fell 4.4% in October from a year earlier after growing at the fastest pace in 5-1/2 years in September, when consumers rushed to buy big-ticket items to beat the sales tax hike. [nL3N27F00S]</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe proceeded with a twice-delayed sales tax hike in October to 10% from 8% as part of efforts to rein in Japan's huge public debt.</p>
      <p>Some investors fret the higher levy may put more pressure on an economy that saw growth ground to a near standstill in the third quarter as the U.S.-China trade war knocked exports.[nL4N27S22T]</p>
      <p>Private consumption grew 0.4% in July-September, slowing from a 0.6% increase in the previous quarter, despite stronger demand from households which sought to beat the October tax hike.</p>
      <p>Heightening fears of recession have prompted calls from ruling party lawmakers for an extra budget including $92 billion in spending to revive growth. [nL3N280528]</p>
      <p>The government will release the retail sales data at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Nov. 28 (2350 GMT, Nov 27), while the industrial production data is set to be released a day later at the same time.</p>
      <p>Data next week also includes the Tokyo consumer price index (CPI) for November, which likely rose 0.6% from a year earlier, according to the Reuters poll.</p>
      <p>Nationwide core CPI rose just 0.4% year-on-year in October, underscoring the challenge the Bank of Japan faces in firing up inflation to its elusive 2% target. [nL3N2811F7]</p>
      <p>The jobless rate, due out on Nov. 27, likely hit 2.4% in October, the poll showed.</p>
