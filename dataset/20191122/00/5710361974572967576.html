      <p>Manufacturing PMI for November released earlier showed that <a href="https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/manufacturing-pmi-829">activity</a> increased to 52.2 vs. and expectation of 51.5 and 52.3 last. A reading of 50 or greater shows economic expansion, while a reading of below 50 shows economic contraction. In addition, consumer sentiment was better than expected. The <a href="https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/michigan-consumer-sentiment-320">Michigan Consumer Sentiment</a> for November was 96.8 vs. and expectation of 95.7 and 95.5 previously. This is the highest reading since July. The U.S. consumer seems to be quite content at the moment with stocks near all time highs. Stocks and <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/us-dollar-index">U.S. dollar</a> were unchanged on the release.</p>
      <p>However the USD tried to stage a late-week rally after an obnoxiously unchanged week. On a 240-minute chart, the Dollar Index seemed to make a charge above support to retest the 50% retracement level from the highs on October 1 to the lows on October 18, at 98.38. If price pushes through there, the target of the inverted head-and-shoulders pattern and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the previously mentioned timeframe comes into place near 98.68.</p>

      <p>As the <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/us-dollar-index">U.S. Dollar Index</a> heads higher, <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/eur-usd">EUR/USD</a> started to pull back. The euro makes up almost two-thirds of the DXY. If EUR/USD breaks through horizontal support at 1.1030, 1.1000 is in sight and so is a confluence of Fibonacci retracement levels near 1.0990 (as well as prior lows). This should prove a tough support area to crack, however if it does, the target for the double top is near 1.0965.</p>

      <p>One thing is certain: after watching this week's price action, volatility has been extremely low. There needs to be a catalyst to really get these markets moving again. Whether it's Brexit or a U.S.-China trade deal, something needs to happen in order to get the volatility back in the USD currency pairs.</p>
