      <p>The passenger service arrived in Rosslare in Co Wexford from Cherbourg in France.</p>
      <p>An Essex Police spokeswoman said: "Police were called to reports of people inside a lorry container at around 6pm.</p>
      <p>"Officers attended and found 10 men in the rear of the container.</p>
      <p>"They have been arrested on suspicion of immigration offences. One was taken to hospital for medical treatment.</p>
      <p>"The driver has been arrested. Inquiries continue."</p>
      <p>A few days ago a lorry carrying 25 migrants in a refrigerated container has been found on a ferry travelling from the Netherlands to England.</p>

      <p>It is believed there is a child among the migrants, although this is yet to be confirmed.</p>
      <p>Emergency services flocked to the Britannia Seaways ferry which had departed from Vlaardingen this evening.</p>
      <p>Up to 20 ambulances have been sent to the Vulcaanhaven port where the cargo ship has returned, <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2311161-26-verstekelingen-in-koelcontainer-op-veerboot-vlaardingen.html">NOS reports.</a></p>
      <p>The migrants on board are all believed to be alive and receiving medical treatment.</p>
      <p>Two people have been sent to hospital for extra care.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the other 23 are being taken away by police 'for processing,' according to a statement posted on the website of regional emergency services.</p>
