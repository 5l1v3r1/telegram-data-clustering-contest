      <h1>Replica Marshmello Helmet Is A Tidy Halloween Build</h1>

      <p>As the saying goes – you don’t need a stylized, bedazzled helmet to have a successful career in EDM, but it helps. Marshmello is the latest in a long line of musicians to sport bespoke headgear, <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Marshmello-LED-Helmet/">and [MikeTheSuperDad] undertook the construction of a replica for Halloween.</a></p>
      <p>The build starts with a piece of concrete form tube as the base of the helmet. This is combined with 3D printed components to create a grid in which to place WS2812B LED strings. These are controlled by an Arduino Pro Mini, which is responsible for handling the animations. Further 3D printed parts are used as templates to cut out the characteristic eyes and mouth, as well as to cover the top. Plastic sheeting is then used over the top of everything to diffuse the LEDs and provide the final look, with black mesh behind the eyes and mouth making them properly stand out.</p>
      <p>Marshmello should be lauded for creating a helmet with a distinctive visual style, while remaining easy to replicate, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/09/06/a-helmet-to-make-daft-punk-jealous/">unlike popular Daft Punk builds of years past</a>. Building a replica could serve as good practice before starting out on your own unique build. Video after the break.</p>
