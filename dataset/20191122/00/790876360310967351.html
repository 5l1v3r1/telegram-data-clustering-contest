            <p><b>1. Notice how they are acting.</b> A big change in behavior is one warning sign that someone may be considering suicide. Paying attention to how the person is acting can help you prevent their suicide.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Help-a-Suicidal-Family-Member#_note-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sometimes people start acting recklessly when they are considering suicide. For example, if your dad starts riding his motorcycle without a helmet, he may be considering suicide.</li>
              <li>Look for signs like giving away possessions that they really care about. For example, if your cousin gives you her favorite necklace for no reason, she might be suicidal.</li>
              <li>Pay attention if they don’t seem interested in things they usually enjoy. For instance, if your aunt loves swimming, but suddenly stopped going for no reason, this might be a warning sign for suicide.</li>
            </ul>

                <p><b>2. Listen to what they are saying.</b> There are several phrases and comments your family member may say that are warning signs that they are considering suicide. You can help your suicidal family member by listening for signs of hopelessness or giving up.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Help-a-Suicidal-Family-Member#_note-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>If your family member says things like, "I don’t have anything to live for" or "I'm just so tired of life" it is probably a sign they’re considering suicide.</li>
                  <li>Listen for phrases that suggest your family member feels like the world would be better without them.</li>
                  <li>For example, "Everyone is better off without me" or "It’ll be better if I’m just not here.”</li>
                  <li>Notice if they say no one gets them or cares about them. For instance, comments like "No one cares or understands me" or "You don’t get me."</li>

                    <p><b>3. Pay attention to their feelings.</b> You can help a suicidal family member if you notice when they seem to be having lots of feelings that may indicate suicide risk.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Help-a-Suicidal-Family-Member#_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Being aware of their feelings of depression, hopelessness, extreme frustration, and exhaustion can help you help your family member.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>For example, your brother used to be pretty calm and laid-back. Now he is grumpy, sensitive, and sad all the time. It might be a warning sign for suicide.</li>
                      <li>You can ask how your family member is feeling by saying, “How have you been feeling lately? Have you been depressed or upset a lot?”</li>
                      <li>If they mention having feelings of guilt, failure, hopelessness, depression, or anxiety, you should pay attention.</li>
                      <li>Some people are more peaceful and less agitated when they are considering suicide because they think they’ve found a solution to their problems.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <p><b>1. Determine their intent.</b> If your family member is in the middle of a suicide crisis or you think they might be, you can help them by determining how serious they are about attempting suicide. Knowing their intent will help you decide the best thing to do to help.</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Let your family member know you care and ask them if they are thinking about suicide. You could say, “I’m concerned. Have you thought about suicide?”</li>
                          <li>If they say they have thought about suicide, you should find out if they have thought about how, when, and where they will do it.</li>
                          <li>You might ask, “Do you have a plan for how to do it? Do you already know when you will do it?”</li>
                          <li>If you think they intend to attempt suicide soon, then don’t leave them alone. If you can’t stay, contact someone else to come stay. Don’t leave until the other person arrives.</li>

                          <p><b>2. Use your 'CLUES'.</b> Remembering the acronym CLUES will help you know what to do if your family member is suicidal right now. It reminds you to connect (C) with your family member and listen (L) to them. It also reminds you to understand (U) their feelings, express (E) concern, and seek (S) help.</p>

                                <li>Connect with your family member by saying things like, “You may feel alone, but you aren’t. I’m here for you.”</li>
                                <li>Don’t tell them that their problems aren’t that bad or that they should cheer up. It will make them feel like you don’t understand. Don’t ask them to explain the reasons for their feelings either because this may seem like you are minimizing their feelings. Just let them know that you are there for them.</li>
                                <li>Try saying something like, “I know it’s really hard for you right now, and there aren’t any easy solutions. But we can work this out.”</li>
