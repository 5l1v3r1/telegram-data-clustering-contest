      <h1>Trump wants Senate trial, expects Joe Biden to testify -White House - Reuters</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:58:11+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/ross-j-burland" target="_blank">Ross J Burland</a></address>
      <p>Reuters reports that President Donald Trump wants an impeachment trial to go forward in the U.S. Senate:</p>
      <blockquote>Trump wants an impeachment trial to go forward in the U.S. Senate because he would receive due process there and he expects Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden would be among the witnesses, a White House spokesman said on Thursday.<br/><br/>"President Trump wants to have a trial in the Senate because it’s clearly the only chamber where he can expect fairness and receive due process under the Constitution," spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement.<br/><br/>"We would expect to finally hear from witnesses who actually witnessed, and possibly participated in corruption - like Adam Schiff, Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and the so-called Whistleblower, to name a few," Gidley said, referring to House of Representatives Intelligence Committee Chairman Schiff, who is leading an impeachment inquiry into Trump.</blockquote>
      <h3>FX implications: </h3>
      <p>Thursday marked the fifth day of public hearings in the House's impeachment enquiry into President Donald Trump and the White House has continued to lash out at the House's impeachment inquiry, calling on Democrats to "stop these illegitimate sham hearings immediately." Indeed, markets are of the mind that there will be no impeachment, but never theless, the saga contued and the yen will be the major beneficary at times of uncertainty. </p>
