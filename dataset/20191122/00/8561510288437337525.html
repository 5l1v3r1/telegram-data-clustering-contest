      <h1>Tesla’s Cybertruck Is a Killer Deal and Nobody Is Talking About It</h1>
      <h2>It's an abomination — but with a really compelling price tag.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://futurism.com/authors/victor" target="_blank">Victor Tangermann</a></address>
      <p>Look.</p>
      <p>We all knew that Tesla’s Cybertruck was <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/tesla-elon-musk-unveils-blade-runner-cybertruck">going to be a monstrosity</a> straight out of “Blade Runner” — Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been saying so himself for years.</p>
      <p>What’s more notable, in the sober light of day, is that its starting price of $39,900 is an absolutely killer deal — there’s literally nothing else like it on the market.</p>
      <p>In 2012, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/230487450882019328">tweeted</a> that he “would love to make a Tesla supertruck with crazy torque, dynamic air suspension and corners like its on rails,” a post that arguably aged like fine wine.</p>
      <p>And in the seven years since, Tesla seems to have pulled it off. Crazy torque? Check. The strongest tri-motor model will be able to tow 14,000 pounds — <a href="https://www.cornerstoneford.com/2019-ford-f-150-towing-capacity.html">800 p0unds</a> more than the best-selling 2019 Ford F-150.</p>
      <p>Dynamic air suspension? Yep. During Thursday evening’s event, Musk revealed that the truck’s air suspension even gives owners access to an on-board air compressor.</p>
      <p>The jury is still out about the “corners like its on rails” bit, since we haven’t even seen the lower-end models. While Sean O’Kane described the interior as “big and roomy” in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976539/tesla-cybertruck-test-drive-electric-truck-pickup-video-features-price-elon-musk">piece for <i>The Verge</i></a>, the high vantage point and odd shape of the car means it isn’t going to outperform a Model S or 3 on the race track.</p>
      <p>That doesn’t mean the Cybertruck is a slouch. It can accelerate from zero to 60 in less than three seconds — faster than the Tesla Model 3 Performance (<a href="https://electrek.co/2019/11/14/tesla-model-3-performance-0-60-mph-acceleration-dips-below-3-sec-software-update/">in 2018</a>) and about <a href="https://autoweek.com/article/car-reviews/ferrari-488-spider-first-drive-madre-im-coming-home">on par</a> with a 2016 Ferrari 488 GTB. A <a href="https://www.roushperformance.com/vehicles/2019-roush-f-150-nitemare.html">special F-150 variant</a> that costs an additional $19,150 over base price clocks in at 3.9 seconds.</p>
      <p>This all comes with an extremely competitive price tag: less than $40,000 base price with a range of over 250 miles, and 500+ miles with the $70,000 variant, is nothing to scoff at — and that’s not including tax incentives which can be <a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxevb.shtml">as high as $7,500</a> in the U.S.</p>
      <p>A comparable 2020 Ford F-150 may start at <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/ford/f-150">just over $30,000</a>, but with a middling combined gas mileage in the mid twenties — you’ll have to shell out for plenty of gas — plus options, the price will likely be much closer to the entry level Cybertruck in the end.</p>
      <p>So what about durability? That’s a big factor if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2V4LKyoPRg">TV ads</a> for pickup trucks are anything to go by, right? ” With hardy cladding and windows that will apparently be <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/tesla-shows-off-bulletproof-cybertruck-breaks-window">unsmashable in the, uh, future</a>, it’s a pickup that will more than likely stand up to the elements, whether on or off the road.</p>
      <p>But there’s a catch: while coverage of Tesla’s Supercharger network is <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/tesla-shows-off-bulletproof-cybertruck-breaks-window">second to none</a>, it’s far less likely that future Cybertruck owners will have a charger station nearby when they’re way out in the country side — and isn’t that the whole point of this thing?</p>
      <p>Tesla’s track record, as far as quality control goes, is also <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-model-3-nextmove-german-cancels-order/">far from perfect</a>. It’s still way too early to tell how sharp lines of “ultra-hard” and “cold-rolled” stainless steel will hold up to day-to-day use — especially outdoors.</p>
      <p>It’s also a departure from the usual aluminum construction we’ve seen in the Model S, X, and 3. Luckily, thanks to Musk, the company will likely <a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-new-tesla-roadster-hover-spacex">get a pointer or two</a> from his other company SpaceX — and the team there <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/stainless-steel-starship-spacex">knows a lot</a> about stainless steel.</p>
      <p>So will it sell? Musk doesn’t seem to care about that part.</p>
      <p>“You know, I actually don’t know if a lot of people will buy this pickup truck or not,” Musk told <i>Recode</i> in a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/2/18053424/elon-musk-tesla-spacex-boring-company-self-driving-cars-saudi-twitter-kara-swisher-decode-podcast">November 2018 interview</a>, “but I don’t care.”</p>
