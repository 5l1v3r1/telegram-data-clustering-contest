      <p>The Federal High Court, Ikoyi, Lagos, has fixed December 2, 2019 for hearing in the case filed against the enactment of the social media bill.</p>
      <p>Human rights activist and lawyer; Tope Akinyode, had on November 12, filed an action in court against the proposed social medial bill, arguing that if enacted, the bill will encroach on fundamental human rights of citizens to free speech.</p>
      <p>Joined as respondents in the suit are the National Assembly, Federal Republic of Nigeria, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Senate President.</p>
      <p>The case with suit number: FHC/L/CS/2037/19 comes up before Justice Lema of Court 2 at the Federal High, Ikoyi Lagos.</p>
      <p>The suit is praying the court for an order of perpetual injunction to restrain the respondents from embarking on further proceedings over the said bill.</p>
      <p>According to Akinyode, the bill is repressive and difficult to maintain without a brutal violation of citizen’s right to free speech. </p>
