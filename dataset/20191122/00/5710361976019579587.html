      <p>Investing.com - Stocks in focus in premarket trading on Friday:</p>
      <p>• Nordstrom (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/nordstrom-inc">JWN</a>) stock jumped 9% in premarket trade by 8:20 AM ET (13:20 GMT) after the retailer beat its top- and bottom-line forecasts. It also raised its 2019 guidance, narrowing its earnings expectations to between $3.30 a share and $3.50 a share.</p>
      <p>• Tesla (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/tesla-motors">TSLA</a>) stock fell 3.5% after a demonstration of its new 'Cybertruck' showed that its supposedly bulletproof glass was easily damaged.</p>
      <p>• Pure Storage (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/pure-storage-inc">PSTG</a>) stock slumped 21% after the data-storage company posted disappointing results and lowered its full-year forecast.</p>
      <p>• Splunk (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/splunk-inc">SPLK</a>) stock rose 7.4% after a strong quarter that led it to raise its fourth-quarter and fiscal year 2020 revenue forecasts.</p>
      <p>• Ross Stores (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/ross-stores-inc">ROST</a>) stock gained 1.1% after a strong third-quarter in which same-store sales came in above predictions. The retailer also increased its fiscal 2020 earnings forecast.</p>
      <p>• Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/williams-sonoma-inc">WSM</a>) stock tumbled 5.1% after its same-store sales fell 2.1%, more than the 1% drop expected.</p>
