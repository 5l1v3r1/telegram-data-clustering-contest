      <p>An angry man has beaten his wife after catching her with<a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2018/08/01/the-beating-is-becoming-unbearable-for-me-woman-cries-out-for-divorce/"><u><b> another man</b></u></a> inside the boutique he opened for her.</p>
      <p>Speaking on why he decided to take the drastic action against the woman on his Facebook account, he said he stripped his wife naked, tied her up and tortured her by beating her because she has turned his boutique shop as her prostitution office.</p>
      <p>Martin Juuko explained he threw his wife, Brenda Namuyomba on the street to be mocked at by their neighbors. According to the young man, he opened a men’s wear shop for his wife but unknown to him, his wife was using the placed to sleep with her boyfriends.</p>
      <p>Martin Juuko posted:</p>
      <p>“<i>My dear customers of Praise shop of Juuko Martin at MM Plaza, I’m sorry I decided to close the shop shortly because my woman Brenda Namuyomba had turned it as her prostitution office while she is my wife, My woman has turned into a prostitute. She removes the knickers I bought her for another man.” Juuko wrote on his Facebook.</i></p>
      <p><i>“She gets everything. I give her money in dollars, I even bought her a car, I fly her abroad frequently, I gave her a bungalow in Munyonyo, but she still cheats on me. What even hurts me most is that she sleeps with my friends as well,”</i> Juuko added.</p>
      <p>Here are pictures of the suspected woman.</p>
