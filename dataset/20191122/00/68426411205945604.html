      <p>Statistics Canada says retail sales fell 0.1 per cent in September to $51.6 billion, weighed down by lower sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers and gasoline stations.</p>
      <p>The result matched the expectations of economists, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>The overall decline came as sales in the motor vehicle and parts dealers subsector fell one per cent due to a 1.9 per cent drop at new car dealers. Sales at gasoline stations fell 2.3 per cent, due in part to lower prices.</p>
      <p>Statistics Canada says excluding these two subsectors, retail sales rose 0.7 per cent.</p>
      <p>Sales at food and beverage stores rose 1.2 per cent, boosted by a 1.1 per cent increase at supermarkets and other grocery stores and a 3.2 per cent increase at beer, wine and liquor stores. Building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers saw sales rise 3.3 per cent.</p>
      <p>Overall retail sales in volume terms fell 0.1 per cent.</p>
