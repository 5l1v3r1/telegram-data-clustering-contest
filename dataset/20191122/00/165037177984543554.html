        <b>Daniel Maldini, an 18-year-old striker and son of AC Milan legend Paolo, is in the Rossoneri squad to face Napoli on Saturday.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/milan/">AC Milan</a> have included<b> Daniel Maldini,</b> son of club great Paolo, in their squad for a <b>Serie A </b>game for the first time.</p>
      <p>The <b>18-year-old forward </b>could make his senior debut for the Rossoneri at home to<b> Napoli</b> on Saturday with Milan having <b>struggled for form</b> despite replacing <b>Marco Giampaolo with Stefano Pioli.</b></p>
      <p>Milan have<b> lost three of their past four league games</b> to slip to 14th in the Serie A table with teenager Maldini having the chance to <b>follow in the footsteps of the club's famous family.</b></p>
      <p>His grandfather <b>Cesare won four league titles with Milan</b> and also coached the team to European Cup Winners' Cup glory, while <b>Paolo is considered one of the greatest defenders in Italian football history.</b></p>
      <p>Paolo is now a director at the club and he could see Daniel become <b>the latest Maldini star for Milan,</b> who have been linked with a move for former striker <b>Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</b></p>
