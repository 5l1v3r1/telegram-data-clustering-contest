      <h1>Video Captures Dramatic Explosion of SpaceX's Starship Prototype During a Test</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">BRYAN LOGAN, BUSINESS INSIDER</a></address>
      <p>SpaceX's Starship Mark 1 prototype rocket partially exploded during a pressure test in Boca Chica, Texas.</p>
      <p>The incident happened Wednesday afternoon and was captured on a livestream. During the test, the upper portion of the rocket blew apart and heavy plumes of smoke flowed from the vehicle.</p>
      <p>"The purpose of today's test was to pressurize systems to the max, so the outcome was not completely unexpected," a SpaceX representative <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974884/spacex-starship-rocket-prototype-failure-test-texas">told The Verge,</a> adding: "There were no injuries, nor is this a serious setback."</p>

      <p>The rocket remained stationary and upright after the event, but it was not immediately clear whether it was salvageable.</p>
      <p>CEO Elon Musk previously said SpaceX would build several versions of Starship, including Mark 2 and Mark 3 prototypes.</p>
      <p>Asked on Twitter whether SpaceX would proceed with its Mark 3 iteration, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1197271943180771329?s=20">Musk seemed to agree</a>: "Absolutely, but to move to Mk3 design. This had some value as a manufacturing pathfinder, but flight design is quite different."</p>
      <p>SpaceX has been developing Starship system at its launch site in South Texas. Musk was there in late September to provide an update on the 164-foot stainless-steel Mark 1 rocket and SpaceX's plan to reach Mars.</p>
      <p>A launch-ready Starship rocket could carry up to 100 people to Mars, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/elon-musk-starship-mars-rocket-update-mars-colonization-texas-2019-9">Business Insider's Dave Mosher reported at the time</a>.</p>
      <p>Musk said "we could potentially see people fly next year" in the vehicle.</p>
