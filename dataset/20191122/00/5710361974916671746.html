      <h1>VirnetX patent win against Apple vacated by U.S. appeals court</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday set aside a jury's calculation that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/apple-computer-inc">AAPL</a>) should pay $503 million for infringing on patents owned by licensing firm VirnetX Holdings Corp, setting the stage for another potential trial in a decade-old legal battle.</p>
      <p>In a partial victory for VirnetX, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit left in place a Texas jury's finding that Apple iPhones infringed two VirnetX patents relating to secure communications technology.</p>
      <p>The court reversed the jury's infringement finding on two other patents, however. Based on that ruling, the court sent the case back to a Texas judge for further proceedings.</p>
      <p>The Texas judge must consider whether to hold a new damages-only trial or to recalculate damages without holding one, the appeals court said.</p>
