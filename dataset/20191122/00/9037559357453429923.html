      <p>The World Bank has restored budgetary support to Pakistan on account of strengthening of economic stability, said Minister of Economic Affairs Hammad Azhar on Friday.</p>
      <p>In a tweet, the minister said: "Both ADB and WB had suspended budgetary support to Pakistan during 2017 due to rising macroeconomic imbalances that had arisen in the economy at that time."</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund reached a staff-level agreement on the first review under the Extended Fund Facility on Friday, according to which Islamabad will receive another installment of US$450 million. </p>
      <p>The international money lender issued a press release according to which the end-September performance criteria were met with "comfortable margins and that progress continues towards meeting all structural benchmarks". </p>
