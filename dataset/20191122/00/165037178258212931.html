        <b>Barcelona are facing a shortage of defenders for their La Liga match at Leganes on Saturday after Clement Lenglet was the latest to be declared injured.Â </b>
      </p>
      <p>"<b>Clement Lenglet</b> was ruled with a calf injury picked up on international duty with France," Barca confirmed on Friday.</p>
      <p>Lenglet joins full-backs <b>Nelson Semedo and Jordi Alba</b> on the sidelines, with Semedo and Alba struggling with calf and hamstring injuries respectively.</p>
      <p><b>Sergi Roberto</b>, who can play at right-back, is suspended and Gerard Pique's sharpness is in <b>doubt due to the Spaniard's involvement</b> with the <b>Davis Cup</b> tennis tournament this week in Madrid.</p>
      <p>In midfield, <b>Arthur Melo, who</b> played in Brazil's friendly win over South Korea on Tuesday has been left out of the squad but <b>Ivan Rakitic is available again</b> after recovering from an Achilles problem.</p>
