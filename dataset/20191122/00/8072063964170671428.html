      <p><b>(NEW YORK POST)</b> —  Two teen migrants from Africa tried to smuggle themselves across the Spanish border hidden inside the dashboard and under the back seats of a car — but their scheme was foiled when authorities used a “heartbeat detection machine” to find them, according to a new report.</p>
      <p>The teens, 17 and 19, from the Sub-Saharan nation of Guinea, were attempting to enter Melilla, a Spanish enclave in north Africa bordering Morocco, when Spain’s Guardia Civil authorities stopped the car for a routine check, the Daily Mail reported.</p>
      <p>Officers decided to investigate further when they found “physical anomalies” in the vehicle, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Authorities employed a “heartbeat detection machine” — which confirmed that there were people hiding inside, the outlet reported.</p>
      <p>Then they conducted a thorough sweep of the car — finding the 17-year-old sprawled across the entire interior of the dashboard and the 19-year-old lying flat across the rear seats, the Mail reported.</p>

      <p>The teens were packed so tightly into the not-so-hidden compartments that police needed to cut parts of the vehicle to get them out, the outlet reported.</p>
      <p>Both were treated at the scene for dehydration and numbness, according to the report. They’d also been exposed to vehicle fumes as they lay cramped in their hiding places.</p>
      <p>None of the injuries were severe enough to warrant further treatment.</p>

      <p>Both were taken to migrant detention facilities in Melilla, according to the report.</p>
      <p>The driver, a 30-year-old Moroccan man, was arrested on suspicion of human trafficking, the outlet reported.</p>
      <p>Migrant border crossings are common in Melilla — which, along with the other Spanish enclave of Ceuta — is a European territory that shares a land border with the African continent.</p>
