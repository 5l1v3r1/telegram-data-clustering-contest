      <p><b>(SKY NEWS) –</b> A woman has been saved from a domestic violence situation thanks to her quick-thinking daughter.</p>
      <p>The daughter, knowing that phoning for help could anger her mother’s attacker further, pretended to be ordering a pizza after dialling 911.</p>
      <p>She told the operator: “I would like to order a pizza.”</p>
      <p>At first, dispatcher Tim Teneyck, who takes anything from a handful to hundreds of calls a day, replied: “This is the wrong number to call for a pizza.”</p>
      <p>But the daughter – who reports suggest is 38 – was insistent: “No, no, no… you’re not understanding.”</p>
      <p>Mr Teneyck realised what was happening and said: “I’m getting you now, I got it.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “Is the other guy still there?”</p>
      <p>The daughter replied: “Yep, I need a large pizza.”</p>
      <p>Mr Teneyck asked: “Alright, how about medical? You need medical?”</p>
      <p>“No, with pepperoni,” was the reply.</p>
      <p>“Alright, we’ll get ’em going,” Mr Teneyck said, as police headed to the home to help. He also instructed them to turn their sirens off before they arrived.</p>
      <p>It was 14 years of experience that helped Mr Teneyck pick up on the caller’s situation.</p>
      <p>He said: “I put it together after she said the second time she was really sticking to her pizza story, so I knew there was something else going on.</p>
      <p>“It’s not really a big deal, it’s what we do every day. Yeah, it’s a little bit outside the normal but not too far out where every other dispatcher can’t do it.”</p>
      <p>Oregon Police Chief Michael Navarre told NBC: “I’ve been in law enforcement for 42 years and I’ve never heard of a person calling up and ordering a pizza to get police response.”</p>
      <p>He said that he hoped victims could use the example in addition to other tools that could help them contact police without risking their lives.</p>
      <p>“So what they do is they teach people to come up with a code word and share that code word with one or two people that are close to them – neighbours, friends, relatives – so that when they are allowed to make a call but not to the police, they can use that code word.”</p>
      <p>Mr Teneyck told the Toledo Blade that he worries exposure of the pizza ruse will alert offenders, so victims in danger should simply call and lay the phone down in a position where dispatchers can listen in and start help that way.</p>
      <p>Never hang up, if you can help it, he said.</p>
      <p>“The best thing to do is just have an open phone line and say as much as you can – address and names – until we can figure it all out,” he said.</p>
      <p>The attacker was arrested and faces a domestic violence charge.</p>
