      <h1>Mohamed Salah to miss start of 2020-21 season?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/"><b>Liverpool</b></a> could reportedly be without <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mohamed-salah/"><b>Mohamed Salah</b></a> for the start of the 2020-21 season after <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/egypt/"><b>Egypt</b></a> qualified for the football event at the 2020 Olympics.</h2>

      <p>The Egyptian under-23 team recently booked their place in the under-23 African Cup of Nations competition, thereby securing themselves qualification for next summer's tournament in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Egypt will be entitled to take three players over the age of 23 to Japan and the <i>Daily Mirror</i> reports that Salah is a favourite to be included given his current standing in world football and form for Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Salah missed Egypt's most recent senior internationals as he continues his recovery from an ankle injury that he has been struggling with for the best part of two months.</p>
