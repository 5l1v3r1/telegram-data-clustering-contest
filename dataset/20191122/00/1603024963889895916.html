      <p>P-notes are issued by registered foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) to overseas investors who wish to be part of the Indian stock market without registering themselves directly after going through a due diligence process.</p>
      <p>Before registering gain in October, investments through P-notes had been declining continuously since June, according to the latest data from markets regulator Sebi.</p>
      <p>The total value of investments via P-notes in the Indian markets (including equity, debt, and derivatives) rose to Rs 76,773 crore till the end of October from Rs 76,611 crore at September-end.</p>
      <p>At the end of August, the Indian capital market saw a total inflow of Rs 79,088 crore through P-notes, a drop from Rs 81,082 crore till July-end. The investment had stood at Rs 81,913 crore at June-end and Rs 82,619 crore at the end of May.</p>
      <p>Of the total investments made till the end of October, Rs 52,753 crore was invested in the equities, Rs 23,316 crore in debt and Rs 704 crore in the derivatives segments.</p>
      <p>In July, the board of Sebi has approved a proposal to rationalise the framework for issuance of P-notes.</p>
      <p>The use of P-notes has been on a decline since 2017 and slumped to a nine-and-a-half year low of Rs 66,587 crore at the end of October last year.</p>
      <p>In July 2017, markets regulator Sebi notified stricter P-notes norms stipulating a fee of USD 1,000 that will be levied on each instrument to check any misuse for channelising black money.</p>
      <p>It had also prohibited FPIs from issuing such notes where the underlying asset is a derivative, except those which are used for hedging purposes.</p>
