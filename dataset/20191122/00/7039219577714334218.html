      <h1>Brazil trade mulls US corn arbitrage as domestic prices surge</h1>

      <p>Rampant strength in Brazil’s domestic market could open a rare corn arbitrage from the US into the South American corn powerhouse – a reversal of a flow that saw Brazilian corn head north earlier in the year.</p>
      <p>“Some guys are wondering about importing US corn here into Brazil. It may be some speculation, but this is something to pay attention to,” one Brazil-based trade source said.</p>
      <p>“It seems to be the rumour du jour, and I think it’s just tyre-kicking,” a US-based source countered.</p>
      <p>But the two origins have seen a significant reversal of fortunes in recent weeks as Brazil’s record-breaking export season has ended with an upward surge in domestic and FOB prices.</p>
      <p>“Maybe people are already doing the maths – US corn is $5/mt cheaper than Brazil. Maybe it makes sense,” a third market source said.</p>
      <p>US Gulf APM-15 FOB corn prices were assessed at $173/mt on Friday, versus APM-14 FOB Santos at $178.25/mt, according to Agricensus data, but any move between the two nations would not be straightforward as US corn is subject to duties.</p>
      <p>That makes Argentina a more likely option in the event that Brazil does import corn, although Brazilian market sources pointed out that imports into the North Northeast region could be feasible.</p>
      <p>“For the northeast part of Brazil it would make sense because freight from Argentina is more expensive,” the first source said.</p>
      <p>“Since Mato Grosso does not have any more corn and states that still have corn don’t want to sell below BRL50/bag, importing from the US could make sense,” a fourth market source said.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the year, US meat company Smithfield capitalised on low Argentinian and Brazilian corn prices to book imports into the east coast of the US.</p>
      <p>This was in view of atrocious weather, which stymied US corn planting and raised fears that the country could face a much smaller-than-expected harvest.</p>
      <p>However, since then both Argentina and Brazil have experienced record export programmes that have drained their record harvests to leave both countries looking spent.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Brazil’s domestic prices have subsequently ramped up as demand from the meat sector has kicked in.</p>
      <p>Against that, US corn planting has delivered a larger-than-feared harvest, with the latest USDA outlook expecting the country’s harvest to top 340 million mt.</p>
