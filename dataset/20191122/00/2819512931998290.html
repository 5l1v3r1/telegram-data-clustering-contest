        <b>A research team led by American University scientists has sequenced the genome of the thermophilic subterrestrial nematode <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halicephalobus_mephisto"><i>Halicephalobus mephisto</i></a>, one of the deepest living animals, and determined the mechanisms by which the nematode adapted to an extreme environment.</b>

      <p><i>Halicephalobus mephisto</i> was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09974">originally discovered</a> inhabiting a fluid-filled aquifer accessed from the Beatrix gold mine in South Africa at 1.3 km below the surface.</p>
      <p>This nematode species <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/6/110601-deepest-worm-earth-devil-science-animals-life/">measures</a> only 0.5 mm in length and lives in warm (37 degrees Celsius), alkaline (pH 7.9), methane-rich water. Radiocarbon dating indicates the aquifer water is over 6,000 years old.</p>
      <p>“<i>Halicephalobus mephisto</i> is the first subterrestrial animal to have its genome sequenced,” said Dr. John Bracht, a researcher at American University and the lead author of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13245-8">paper</a> published in the journal <i>Nature Communications</i>.</p>
      <p>“The genome offers evidence of how life can exist below Earth’s surface and opens up a new way of understanding how life can survive beyond Earth.”</p>
      <p>The sequencing revealed that the genome of <i>Halicephalobus mephisto</i> encodes an unusually large number of heat-shock proteins known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsp70">Hsp70</a>, which is notable because many nematode species whose genomes are sequenced do not reveal such a large number.</p>
      <p>Hsp70 is a well-studied gene that exists in all life forms and restores cellular health due to heat damage.</p>
      <p>Many of the Hsp70 genes in the <i>Halicephalobus mephisto</i> genome were copies of themselves.</p>
      <p>The genome also has extra copies of <a href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=AIG1">AIG1</a> genes, known cellular survival genes in plants and animals.</p>
      <p>“More research will be needed, but the presence of copies of the gene signifies the worm’s evolutionary adaptation,” Dr. Bracht said.</p>
      <p>“It can’t run away; it’s underground. It has no choice but to adapt or die. We propose that when an animal cannot escape intense heat, it starts making additional copies of these two genes to survive.”</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00239-019-09900-9">separate study</a>, published in the <i>Journal of Molecular Evolution</i>, Dr. Bracht and colleagues examined a number of genomes and found that expansion of both AIG1 and Hsp70 gene families is common in bivalves, a group of mollusks including clams, oysters and mussels.</p>
      <p>These animals are heat-adapted like <i>Halicephalobus mephisto</i>. This suggests that the pattern identified in <i>Halicephalobus mephisto</i> may extend more generally to organisms unable to escape environmental heat.</p>
