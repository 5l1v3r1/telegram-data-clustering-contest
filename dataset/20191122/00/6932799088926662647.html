        <b>Microsoft has announced that it has secured a license from the US government that allows it to sell its products to Huawei again. This will, for example, enable the OEM to put Windows on future generations of its MateBooks.

This news may have come as a relief to the Chinese electronics giant, whose supplier base has reportedly atrophied following <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Huawei-sees-partial-reprieve-from-US-trade-ban.426722.0.html">sanctions</a> imposed on it that prevent it working with American firms such as Qualcomm and Intel.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the Redmond software behemoth has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-huawei/microsoft-granted-license-to-export-mass-market-software-to-huawei-idUSKBN1XV2LE">not specified</a> which of its products have been cleared for sale to Huawei again. Its new license, as opposed to the temporary general <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Huawei-sees-partial-reprieve-from-US-trade-ban.426722.0.html">trade-ban waiver</a> that may expire soon, was granted on November 20, 2019.</p>
      <p>The US authorities have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-huawei/microsoft-granted-license-to-export-mass-market-software-to-huawei-idUSKBN1XV2LE">stated that</a> it has received applications for similar licenses to sell to <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Huawei-teases-the-MatePad-Pro-in-a-new-promo-video.443865.0.html">Huawei</a> from approximately 300 companies to date. However, of these, only 25% of these US organizations have had <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Xbox-Project-Scarlett-will-be-more-powerful-than-the-PS5-and-not-too-pricey-according-to-Microsoft.443217.0.html">Microsoft</a>'s success in gaining approval to deal with this company.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, there is no concrete word on whether <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Google-Stadia-users-are-reporting-overheating-issues-with-the-Chromecast-Ultra.443858.0.html">Google</a> - a potentially <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Huawei-Mate-30-series-launches-with-power-user-specs-but-without-Google-Mobile-Services.435040.0.html">crucial partner</a> in promoting the uptake of phones such as the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Huawei-Mate-30-Pro-has-officially-arrived-in-Europe.443875.0.html">Mate 30</a> series -Â  is among these applicants or not.</p>
