        <b>A phone called the Vivo V1938T has gained 3C certification in China. Given that it has dual-band 5G, this device is most likely the X30 or its Pro variant. This series is also now rumored to have quad cameras with a 60MP sensor, a 4500mAh battery and at least 8GB of RAM.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Vivo-is-to-release-a-new-kind-of-S1-Pro-in-India-soon.443879.0.html">Vivo</a> has reportedly <a href="https://www.nashvillechatterclass.com/alleged-vivo-x30-5g-phone-vivo-v1938t-with-33w-charging-speed-bags-ccc-certification/46206/">certified</a> a phone called the V1938T with the regulator 3C in China. This documentation reveals that it has dual-band 5G, and as the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Vivo-reportedly-wants-to-make-a-5G-phone-with-Samsung-s-Exynos-980-SoC.434446.0.html">Exynos 980</a> SoC is the only processor capable of such connectivity, there are very few candidates for this model's eventual identity as a product.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is most likely that the Vivo V1938T is the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Vivo-discloses-more-detail-on-the-5G-X30-except-not-really.441927.0.html">X30</a> - or the X30 Pro. Its new official approval does not reveal much about it, besides the fact that it will have a power brick that will support 33-watt (W) charging. However, some recent leaks suggest that this upcoming <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Health-check-Is-5G-really-bad-for-you-Debunking-some-5G-related-myths-and-fake-news.428222.0.html">5G</a> series will have a <a href="https://www.nashvillechatterclass.com/alleged-vivo-x30-5g-phone-vivo-v1938t-with-33w-charging-speed-bags-ccc-certification/46206/">60MP</a> camera.</p>
      <p>It will form part of a rear-panel arrangement with 3 other lenses of varying sizes and functions. Furthermore, it is now <a href="https://news.mydrivers.com/1/658/658573.htm">rumored that</a> it will render the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Exynos-980-powered-Vivo-X30-might-show-up-tomorrow.441313.0.html">Vivo X30</a> (or Pro) capable of 60x zoom. The Exynos 980-powered devices are also thought to have between 8 and 12GB of RAM, and to start at a price of 3198 yuan (~US$454).</p>
