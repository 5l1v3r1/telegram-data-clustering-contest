      <p><b>SANTA</b> <b>CRUZ,</b> <b>St</b> <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>—</b> <b>Head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>St</b> <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>police,</b> <b>Superintendent</b> <b>Samuel</b> <b>Morgan,</b> <b>is</b> <b>urging</b> <b>motorists</b> <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>greater</b> <b>caution</b> <b>and</b> <b>abide</b> <b>by</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>rules</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Westmoreland-based</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>near</b> <b>here</b> <b>Tuesday.</b></p>
      <p>The accident victim, Wyarth Wilkins, a teacher at Frome Technical High School, died after the car he was driving collided with two other motor vehicles then ran into a light post.</p>
      <p>Police believe speeding and improper overtaking led to the crash.</p>
      <p>“I want to say to everyone, we must reduce speed and avoid improper overtaking. We should overtake only when it is safe to do so,” Morgan told the <b>Jamaica Observer</b>.</p>
      <p>Reports say Wilkins, who had just exited Lacovia, was travelling east towards Santa Cruz when he attempted to overtake another vehicle in the vicinity of Content District.</p>
      <p>He reportedly collided with an oncoming vehicle, travelling from the direction of Santa Cruz, as well as with the vehicle he had unsuccessfully attempted to overtake.</p>
      <p>Reports say the momentum of the collisions sent the vehicle crashing into the light post.</p>
      <p>Those who were on the spot told the <b>Observer</b> that Wilkins was trapped in the crushed vehicle and had to be cut free by firefighters. He was rushed to hospital where he was pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>The accident led to a traffic pile-up lasting in excess of 40 minutes.</p>
      <p>Reports say Wilkins was on his way to regularly scheduled class at HEART/Trust NTA in Mandeville at the time of his untimely death.</p>
      <p>Police say 24 people have now died in 21 road crashes in St Elizabeth since the start of the year.</p>
