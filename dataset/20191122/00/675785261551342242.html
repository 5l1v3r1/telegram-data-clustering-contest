      <h2>Kendall Jenner was particularly unimpressed by I'm A Celebrity campmate Caitlyn's tell-all memoir The Secrets of My Life after it 'attacked' Kris Jenner</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:01:30+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> campmate <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">Caitlyn Jenner</a> faced a backlash from her daughter Kendall, after the publication of her tell-all memoir.</p>
      <p>When Caitlyn revealed her inside story in 2017's The Secrets of My Life, she faced the wrath of the Kardashians after they took exception to her revelations in the book.</p>
      <p>Her 23-year-old daughter Kendall was among the most outspoken at the time, labelling the secrets that were uncovered as "insane" and taking aim at Caitlyn for dissing the Kardashian family.</p>
      <p>In a clip from the family's reality show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kendall vents her anger at momager Kris about Caitlyn going public.</p>

      <p>The supermodel said: "I heard about all the stuff that she was saying in [the book] and just how a lot of it’s so not true.</p>
      <p>"The weird part is, I don’t think it’s purposeful lying. I think she really just thinks that’s what happened for some weird reason.”</p>
      <p>Kendall's biggest frustration is over the way Caitlyn 'attacks' the Kardashians, with Kim, Kourtney and Khloe coming under fire.</p>
      <p>She continued: "And then she goes around dissing the Kardashians, but it’s like, those are the kids that you raised! If you have a problem with them, you raised them!</p>
      <p>"That makes no sense to me that she would go around bashing us for no reason. That’s insane!”</p>
      <p>Kendall found a supporter in her mother Kris, who was married to Caitlyn when she was Bruce Jenner, between 1991 and 2015.</p>

      <p>Kris agreed with her Kendall’s sentiments, saying: “It could’ve been handled in the most amazing, loving way.</p>
      <p>"Talk about your journey and keep it to that. That I would’ve had great respect for... there’s lies that are printed in a book that lives there for the end of time, so your children are going to read this book about their grandparents and have a story that’s fabricated, that’s in print, and is a fabrication."</p>

      <p>Later that year, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres show and repeated the family's thoughts that Caitlyn went too far with her thoughts on the reality TV queens.</p>
      <p>Kim said: "I don’t think it’s necessary and I just feel like it’s unfair, things aren’t truthful. I just feel like I don’t respect the character that she’s showing now.”</p>
      <p>Caitlyn is currently Down Under in the I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! jungle and is one of the favourites t reach the final of the ITV series.</p>
