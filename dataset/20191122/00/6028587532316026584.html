      <p>As the holidays draw near, we’re all—ok, maybe not all—looking forward to spending time with our families. Whether we’re gathered around the dining room table, huddled before a roaring fire, or standing around a turkey fryer in the backyard, we recognize that the holidays create precious moments for family members to reconnect.What happens when the "Hey, how are you's" and the "this is what I've been up to's" begin to fade, and it's time to talk about something else? Where will the conversation turn? To politics? Oh, please, anything but that. The latest blockbuster movie? Better, but surely we have better things to discuss with one another, don’t we?</p>
      <p>Indeed, we do—especially if the relatives we’re spending time with just so happen to be colleagues and coworkers in the business our family calls its own. In this article, we're going to look at why conversations about the family’s business are essential during the holidays, what they should look like, and who should go about initiating them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Deep Why Behind Holiday Conversations About the Family Business</b>
      </p>
      <p>Some family business advisors disagree. Still, I believe the holidays are a crucial time to come together as a family and talk—at least, for some of the time—about the family business in a light and positive way - how it's going, and what it's meant over the years. </p>
      <p>Especially if your family has not had the opportunity or an established forum to come together throughout the year, the holidays may offer a venue to initiate the thinking around key topics.</p>
      <p>It’s no secret that successful business families talk about the business. Many leaders retell stories of learning important business lessons from the stories and conversations that they observed or had with members of the older generation while growing up.</p>
      <p>When you’re <i>in</i> the business every day, conversations often center around operational tactics. When you take a step back to gather in someone’s home, though, you get a unique opportunity to talk about the business at a much higher level and in a lighter way, weaving in the core values and formative stories that make you who you are as a family. The stories we tell are the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/celinnedacosta/2017/12/19/why-every-business-needs-powerful-storytelling-to-grow/#2f93fde443b0">glue</a> that holds companies together—especially when looking towards a <a href="https://www.newbusiness.co.uk/articles/trainingeducation/planning-fail-understanding-global-crisis-family-business-succession">succession in the family business’</a> future.  </p>
      <p>More than that, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rochellemclarke/2019/05/15/how-successful-business-owners-celebrate-milestones-differently-and-grow/#42a2f0b61634">stories convey the reason for and essence of</a> your family’s business to the younger generation of listeners who happen to be gathered at the table. <i>Values aren’t taught; they’re caught.</i> And the best way to ensure the next generation catches the values that matter most to your family business is to immerse them in it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What to Talk About?</b>
      </p>
      <p>You don’t need an agenda for Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner. It would help, though, to have a few topics in mind to help steer the conversation towards the family business.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the top conversation options to consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Origin Story – </b>Everyone loves the old tales about how the business first got off the ground. Find ways to introduce and revel in the “glory days” with the family.<b> </b>This is an excellent way to communicate your deep why, vision, and values (see above).</li>
        <li><b>Future Plans – </b>Where’s the business going? What are we hoping for? How long do the current owners intend to stick around? What comes next? Think in terms of abstract vision rather than concrete strategy. This isn’t a board meeting.</li>
        <li><b>Continuity – </b>Coupled with the previous topic, what happens if something were to happen to the current head of the business or other key employee? Is there a business continuity plan or other contingency in place? Has anyone even thought through that question?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some of these conversations may seem a touch “too” intentional. Fair enough, but the sad fact is that 70% of first-generation family businesses <a href="https://www.familybusinesscenter.com/resources/family-business-facts/">fail to transition</a> to the second. A massive contributor to that failure rate is the lack of intentional conversations and settled plans concerning transition and succession.</p>
      <p>Without an established governance structure in the family business, the holidays may be your <i>only </i>chance to kick off those crucial discussions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who Speaks First?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Without bogging the conversation down in details, holiday conversations offer a low-stakes opportunity to think together about the future, raise significant concerns, and at least introduce the subject of succession for future exploration back at the office.</p>
      <p>But who should initiate that conversation?</p>
      <p>In a real sense, <i>everyone</i> has an interest in the family business. That’s what makes it fair game at the holiday dinner table. It’s also why <i>everyone</i> has a right to raise the subject.</p>
      <p>If you’re in the upper crust of the family business—whether you’re in a formal leadership role or you've been around long enough to speak up—don’t let this opportunity pass by without engaging your family members in a lively chat about the business.</p>
      <p>If you’re still young and don’t think you have the clout to engage your family members, speak up anyway! This is potentially <i>your</i> future business, even if you’re still in school navigating the complexities of high school Math or working in the business’ mailroom. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Conclusion</b>
      </p>
      <p>The holidays are a wonderful time to reconnect with family and give thanks for all that you've enjoyed throughout the year. To be able to run a business together can be a <i>huge</i> privilege. Take this opportunity to remind one another of that fact.</p>
