      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari has denied reports in some quarters in the country that he is seeking a third term in office as Nigeria’s President.</p>
      <p>Naija News reports that the President dismissed the rumour at the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital on Friday, November 22.</p>
      <p>This online news platform understands that there had been reports that President Buhari who is currently serving his second term in office as Nigeria’s President, is seeking a third term in office.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the reports, President Buhari said seeking a third term in office would be a “mistake.”</p>
      <p>Citing the importance of the Nigerian constitution, the President maintained that he had sworn by the Holy book that he would respect the constitution and as such, would only serve two terms.</p>
      <p>His words: “I’m not going to make the mistake of attempting a third term,” the president said.</p>
      <p>“Beside the age, I swore by the holy book that I would go by the constitution and the constitution said two terms. I know that I’m in my last term and I can afford to be reckless because I’m not going to ask for anybody’s vote.”</p>
      <p>Speaking further, President Buhari said history would not be fair to members of the ruling party if the APC collapses after his second term.</p>
      <p>“Every member of NEC from today should reposition himself or herself to make sure that you have dominated your constituencies politically.</p>
      <p>“The aim is that history will not be fair to us if outrightly if the APC collapses at the end of this term.</p>
      <p>“History will be fair to us if APC remains strong and not only hold the centre but make gains,” he said.</p>
