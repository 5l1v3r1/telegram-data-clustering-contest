      <h1>VW to end support of combustion engine programmes, favours electric</h1>

        <b>Volkswagen will end its factory support of all programmes using internal combustion engines after implementing a motorsport strategy focused on electric mobility.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a statement released on Friday Volkswagen said its motorsport division's "clear emphasis on fully electric racing cars" would be complemented by a "farewell" to all regular programmes, which would include stopping the production of its Golf GTI TCR car at the end of this year.</p>
      <p>Explaining the decision to adopt an electric-only strategy, Volkswagen Motorsport director Sven Smeets said motorsport could be used as a "trailblazer" for the development of electric vehicles.</p>
      <p>Volkswagen said its ID.R electric prototype - which has set outright records at Pikes Peak, Goodwood and on the Tianmen Mountain, and also holds the Nurburgring Nordschleife electric record - would continue to take over the "role as a technological pioneer".</p>
      <p>It will also work on new projects for its ID. family of cars, which will be developed around the same Modular Electric Drive Toolkit that a number of its electric production vehicles will be based on.</p>

      <p>"On the one hand, it serves as a dynamic laboratory for the development of future production cars and, on the other, as a convincing marketing platform to inspire people even more towards electric mobility," said Smeets.</p>
      <p>"That is why we are going to focus more than ever on factory-backed electric drive commitments and continue to expand our activities with the development of the MEB.</p>
      <p>"Innovative technology relevant to the car of the future is our focus."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson confirmed to Autosport that the decision will bring an immediate end to the development of a new TCR car based on the Mk8 Golf, and Volkswagen Motorsport's alliance with the Sebastien Loeb Racing World Touring Car Cup team.</p>
      <p>The new racing version of the Golf was planned to be released to TCR customers in spring or summer next year, and has been testing as recently as this week.</p>
      <p>Volkswagen's Polo GTI R5 model "remains an integral part of Volkswagen Motorsport's customer sport offering" and will continue to be produced, but factory-backed entries will no longer be lodged.</p>
