      <p>According to her husband, BJ Whitmer, three-time and current Women of Honor Champion Kelly Klein has been fired by the company. The 33-year-old, who is currently out of action after suffering a concussion, was apparently informed of the news via email. Whitmer took to Twitter on Thursday to confirm the news.</p>

      <p>Klein was one of the Superstars to speak out recently in support of former <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/ring-of-honor">ROH</a> Producer, Joey Mercury, who has been very critical of the company on social media. Recently Mercury published an email from GM Greg Gilleland revealing some private information about Klein's contract. He did so with her permission, and it appears to have cost Klein her job with ROH.</p>
      <p>Mercury has taken to Twitter to allegedly post the termination email sent to Klein. If it turns out to be legitimate, it appears Klein was not terminated exactly. Her contract will instead expire and she will not be re-signed.</p>

      <p>The Gate Keeper herself has stated in the past that she only spoke out in hopes of bringing positive change to the company. This is something she apparently still wishes for even after being informed that the company no longer has any plans for her.</p>
