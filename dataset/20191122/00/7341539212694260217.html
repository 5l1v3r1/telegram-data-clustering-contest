      <p>Nov 21, 2019<br/>A pothi containing the translation of the Sikh prayer Japji Sahib into 19 languages was offered to the Golden Temple to be placed in the museum, as a gift to mark Guru Nanak Dev's 550th birth anniversary.</p>
      <p>A 400 page bejeweled book containing translations of the Sikh prayer, Japji Sahib into 19 languages will be offered to the Golden Temple to mark the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak’s 550th birth anniversary.</p>
      <p>Japji Sahib is a prayer at the beginning of the Sikh holy scripture, Guru Granth Sahib, which was composed by Guru Nanak – the founder of Sikhism. It has now been translated into different languages, including English, Turkish, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Dutch, Estonian, French, Finnish, German, Italian, Melayu, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Guarini.</p>
      <p>“It is an honour that we have been the part of such fruitful practice, on the occasion of Guru Nanak Dev ji’s birthday,” said Shanti Kaur Khalsa of Sikh Dharma International – the organisation that undertook the project.</p>
      <p>Ms Khalsa said the project had been underway for quite some time.</p>
      <p>“The project was to compile the translations into a book. The translations– done by members of our community in the respective countries - were already in place,”</p>

      <p>The Sikh Dharma International, founded by Siri Singh Sahib <i>aka </i>Yogi Bhajan, has successfully translated the Gurbani scripture Japji Sahib into 19 international languages including English. The SDI will hand over a copy of each of these translated versions to SGPC for placing these in the Central Sikh Museum situated in Sri Harmandir Sahib complex.</p>
      <p>“On the occasion of Guru Nanak Dev ji’s birthday, this book titled Japji Sahib – the Light of Guru Nanak for the World, will be given to the Sikh Museum at the Golden Temple in the name of the Siri Singh Sahib, Yogi Bhajan and on behalf of the 3HO/Sikh Dharma communities around the world. There it will remain for all time in testimony to our love for the path of Nanak,” reads an informational note shared by the Sikh Dharma International.</p>
      <p>SDI affiliated Shanti Kaur Khalsa informed that the flowers of corresponding countries have been printed over the edges of the pages of these translated copies.</p>
