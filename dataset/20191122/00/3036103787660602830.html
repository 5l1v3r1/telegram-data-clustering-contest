      <p>“This is a dream come true,” said Federer.</p>
      <p>“I will play in my mother’s home country against my toughest rival and friend Rafa Nadal. It will be a once-in-a-lifetime moment for my family and me.”</p>
      <p>“Roger and I have shared so many magical moments on and off the court,” said Nadal.</p>
      <p>“Travelling with him to Cape Town and playing for the benefit of children is something I am very excited about. It will be my first time in the region with Roger as a tour guide – that will be fun.”</p>
