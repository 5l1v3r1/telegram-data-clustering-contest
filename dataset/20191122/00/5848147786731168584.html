      <h1>Do you swear as much as the average Australian?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:01:49+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/newdaily/" target="_blank">The New Daily</a></address>
      <p>Men aged between 40 and 54 are the biggest potty mouths in the country, and they drop choice expletives most often behind the wheel.</p>
      <p>A new survey has quizzed Australian on their swearing habits, and found that when we do cuss, we don’t do it with the attempt to offend – it’s mostly an exclamation of stress, or for a joke.</p>
      <p>Men swear more than women – at sport and at work in particular.</p>
      <p>Forty one per cent of the 1000-odd Australians surveyed admitted to swearing while driving, and 35 per cent of us cut loose when we’re doing chores at home.</p>
      <p>Another 32 per cent swear when we’re fighting with our partners.</p>
      <p>It might not be the most dignified way to express our thoughts or feelings, but we’re not doing it to be hurtful – 54 per cent of us swear to relieve tension.</p>
      <p>Another quarter of us swear to eke out a laugh.</p>
      <p>(Only 8 per cent of people said they swear with the intent of causing offence.)</p>

      <p>An uncouth sentence has many functions, depending on the individual, Macquarie University senior lecturer in linguistics Nick Wilson said.</p>
      <p>“Swearing has many different functions, it can be used to signal frustration, to emphasise emotion, or to show solidarity,” Dr Wilson said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“People have different viewpoints on swearing depending on their age and background. For some people it is part of their identity, for others it is deeply offensive.”</p>

      <p>Millennials said they use swear words like adjectives; to try and give more emphasis to what they’re saying.</p>
      <p>Their Generation X counterparts drop S-, F- and all manner of bombs at things that can’t swear back – the news, TV or radio, and while watching sport.</p>
      <p>Boomers are the most wary of their language – almost 80 per cent try not to swear around children.</p>
      <p>They also swear the least: 13 per cent of Millennials reckon they swear more than 20 times a day, compared with only 7 per cent of Boomers.</p>
      <p>The data – gathered from a survey conducted by Oral B – also found women don’t give a gosh-darn if they swear around their partners, with only 19 per cent holding back, compared to 37 per cent of men.</p>
