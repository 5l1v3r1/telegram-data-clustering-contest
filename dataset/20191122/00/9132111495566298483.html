      <p>Outspoken Member of Parliament (MP) for Assin Central is not happy about the lack of respect legislators command in Ghana.</p>
      <p>Kennedy Ohene Agyapong said in spite of the hustle they go through to get elected, MPs are the least respected in Ghana.</p>
      <p>Sharing his frustration on Net 2 TV, monitored by Adomonline.com, the Assin Central MP blamed their predicament on the late release of the District Assemblies Common Fund.</p>
      <p>This, he stressed, impedes their ability to undertake developmental projects in their constituencies and satisfy the insatiable quest of their constituents.</p>
      <p>Mr Agyapong said Ghanaians respect ‘people who carry toilet’ than MPs because they fear the consequences that may result if they fail to obey them.</p>
      <p>“Let’s be honest, MP and assemblyman are two stupid jobs in this country, people do not respect any of these people. Ghanaians tend to respect people who carry toilets than MPs and assemblymen all because they know they will face dire consequences when they mock such people…,” he added.</p>
