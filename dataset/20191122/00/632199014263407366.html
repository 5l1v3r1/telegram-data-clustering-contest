      <p>Mobility company AppyWay and fleet management firm Safo have announced a new partnership that will bring accurate kerbside data and <a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/tag/parking?Page=1">better parking</a> for fleet drivers and operators.</p>
      <p>Daily parking issues from navigating to a space to interpreting the local traffic regulations for that bay, are all a cause for concern for fleets.</p>
      <p>The companies believe driver wellbeing will be improved and emissions can be reduced if unnecessary driving in the search for suitable parking was stopped.</p>
      <p>AppyWay's chief executive officer and founder Dan Hubert said: "By partnering with Safo we can bring our vision of making parking forgettable to fleets and fleet managers.</p>
      <p>“Along with the implications to business operations through PCNs and impoundments, searching for parking clogs up city streets resulting in greater congestion and emissions, and parking illegally creates safety and accessibility concerns for vulnerable road users.</p>
      <p>“Ensuring a vehicle is parked correctly benefits both the fleet and the communities they operate in.”</p>
      <p>Safo develops fleet management software, providing services to a portfolio ranging from top rental and lease players, car sharing, and large private and corporate international fleet companies.</p>
      <p>Drivers using Safo’s technology will have access to gain full visibility on; length of bay, bay count, paid bays, disabled bays, EV bays, motorcycle bays, free bays, loading bays, resident bays, and car club bays, all with up to 1m accuracy.</p>
      <p>Both Safo and AppyWay have plans to innovate the portfolio further, ensuring drivers are catered for in new mobility technology and fleet managers can better manage the burden of bad parking.</p>
      <p>Jane Taylor, sales and marketing manager at Safo, said: “In our constant drive for customer satisfaction, innovation and digitisation, we are pleased to work with AppyWay using their data to surprise and delight fleet drivers across the UK.</p>
      <p>“We firmly believe that through a better parking experience we not only improve driver wellbeing but also help reduce carbon emissions.</p>
      <p>“This is the first step to achieving that with AppyWay through the integration of our Customer Mobile APP”.</p>
