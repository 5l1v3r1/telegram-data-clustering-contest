      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - An Irish man has pleaded guilty to assault for punching another man who fell and died outside a New York City bar.</p>
      <p>Court records show Steven O’Brien pleaded guilty Thursday in the encounter that led to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-mcgee/">John McGee</a>’s death last Thanksgiving. The 21-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-mcgee/">McGee</a> went by Danny and grew up in Ireland.</p>
      <p>WPIX-TV reports the 26-year-old O’Brien apologized to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-mcgee/">McGee</a>’s parents in a Queens courtroom Thursday.</p>
      <p>Authorities said the two men argued and O’Brien punched <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-mcgee/">McGee</a> in the head. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-mcgee/">McGee</a> fell and hit his head on the pavement.</p>
      <p>He was found lying on the ground and was pronounced dead at a hospital</p>
