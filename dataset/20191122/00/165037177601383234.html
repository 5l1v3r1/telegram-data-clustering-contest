        <b>Despite rumours linking him with a return to Bayern Munich, Pep Guardiola insists he has no plans to move back to the Bundesliga giants yet.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Pep Guardiola </b>has no immediate plans to swap <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City </a>for a return to his former club <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/bayern-munchen/">Bayern Munich.</a></p>
      <p>Bayern are on the<b> search for a new coach</b> after sacking Niko Kovac earlier in November.</p>
      <p><b>Hans-Dieter Flick is currently interim coach</b>, while <b>Mauricio Pochettino </b>- who was sacked by Tottenham on Tuesday - has <b>been linked with a switch</b> to the Allianz Arena.</p>
      <p>The <b>Bundesliga champions</b> are also rumoured to be interested in<b> moving for City boss Guardiola,</b> who spent three seasons at Bayern between <b>2013 and 2016 </b>before taking over at City.</p>
      <p>However, Guardiola has insisted Bayern are aware <b>he is a person who respects his contracts</b>, adding he wishes to stay at City as long as the club want him to remain. </p>
      <p>"When these things appear, is it the media or the club? We don't know. It could be one guy [starting a rumour] and then people take it," Guardiola told Sky Sports News.</p>
      <p><b>"I like the people from Bayern a lot.</b> I was incredibly happy there, but they know I'm a guy that respects what I sign".</p>
      <p>"In football, when you are not getting results you can be sacked but in this case<b> if the club [Manchester City] wants me, I want to stay here".</b></p>

      <p>"It doesn't matter if Bayern want me or not in the future.<b> My love for the city, the club and the people I met there is incredible".</b></p>
      <p>"It is the same in<b> Barcelona because it is my hometown,</b> but the same happened here. I have more things to do."</p>
      <p>Guardiola acknowledged <b>he will not remain at City forever,</b> but insists it is the memories created at clubs that form the<b> best legacies.</b></p>
      <p>"That is the real legacy that you like, more than lifting titles," Guardiola said. <b>"You remember the places for the people you live with,</b> not for the museums or cathedrals".</p>
      <p>"I will not be here [at Manchester City] forever. It's important when you leave that<b> you can come back and be happy with the people."</b></p>
      <p>Under Guardiola, City have won successive Premier League titles, two EFL Cups and an FA Cup, as well as two Community Shields.</p>
