A range of discounts on hotels, cars rentals and recreational experiences are also being offered through Tourism Australia’s Aussie specialist agents, key distribution partners and leading online travel agents like MakeMyTrip, GoIbibo, Yatra and Cleartrip.</p>
      <p>Nishant Kashikar, country manager, India and Gulf, Tourism Australia said, “We are always exploring avenues to keep offering value for money holiday experiences to our Indian travellers. We are proud to collaborate with seven leading airlines, our key distribution partners and the Australian tourism Industry to provide this opportunity to Indian travellers. The response to the previous versions of the sale event has been phenomenal, and we are confident of repeating this success given that 2020 is a power packed year of cricket in Australia.”</p>
