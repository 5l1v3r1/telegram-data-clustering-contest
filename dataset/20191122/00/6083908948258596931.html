      <h1>Joe Biden Snaps at Fox News Reporter After Asking About Hunter’s Biden Paternity Test</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://townhall.com/author/juliorosas" target="_blank">Julio Rosas</a></address>
      <p>Former Vice President Joe Biden was not happy after Fox News reporter Peter Doocy asked about the revelation that DNA tests confirm Hunter Biden, 49, is the father of a baby in Arkansas.</p>
      <p>"I’m wondering if you have a comment on this report out of Arkansas that your son Hunter just made you a grandfather?" Doocy asked.</p>
      <p>"No, that’s a private matter. I have no comment," Biden replied, adding, "But only you would ask that. You’re a good man. You’re a good man. Classy."</p>
      <p>One woman can be seen rolling her eyes as Doocy asked the question.</p>
      <p>It was reported by the <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/nov/20/dna-test-shows-hunter-biden-father-arkansas-womans/"><i>Arkansas Democrat Gazette</i></a> on Wednesday the DNA testing, done at behest of the mother, Lunden Alexis Roberts, 28, had established, “with scientific certainty,” that Joe Biden's son is the father of the baby.</p>
      <p>In a motion filed Wednesday in Independence County on behalf of Roberts, Hunter Biden "is not expected to challenge the results of the DNA test or the testing process." Roberts met Biden while taking classes at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. She gave birth to "Baby Doe" in August 2018.</p>
      <p>Roberts <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/nov/21/filing-no-doubt-dad-of-baby-is-biden-so/">is seeking</a> $10,190 in attorney's fees and $867.80 in costs from Biden, including "travel expenses related to the recent DNA tested in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on November 9, 2019." because of Biden's "refusal to continue to support his child and the course of the litigation in this case."</p>
      <p>Biden initially denied having a sexual relationship with Roberts.</p>
      <p>"She always knew that the DNA test would prove that he was the father," Clint Lancaster, Roberts' attorney, said. "She has always maintained that there could be no one else who was the father of this child."</p>
