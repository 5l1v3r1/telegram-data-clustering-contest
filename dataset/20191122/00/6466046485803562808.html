      <p>Antwerp - <b>Seven major players have joined forces in Belgium to reduce CO2 emissions </b>in Belgium by 80% by 2050 compared to 2005 levels. Deme, Engie, Exmar, Fluxys, Port of Antwerp, Port of Zeebrugge and WaterstofNet have signed a cooperation agreement to bring their expertise together in a coordinated way and to take steps towards a Belgian hydrogen economy.</p>
      <p>In a first phase, the <b>partners will make a joint analysis</b> of the entire hydrogen import and transport chain. The aim is to map the financial, technical and regulatory aspects of the various components in the logistics chain: production, loading and unloading and transport by sea and via pipelines. The outcome of the analysis must be a roadmap that indicates the best way to transport hydrogen for the various applications in the energy and chemical sector. The results of this analysis, which is expected to be ready in approximately one year, will form the bridge towards concrete projects.</p>
      <p>“We want <b>to give every chance to hydrogen as an energy carrier</b>, as basic element for chemistry and as a fuel, and therefore commit ourselves as an active pioneer of the hydrogen economy,” said Jacques Vandermeiren, CEO Port of Antwerp.</p>
