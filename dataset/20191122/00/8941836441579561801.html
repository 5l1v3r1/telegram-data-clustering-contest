      <h1>Adams’ 20 lead UConn over Buffalo 79-68 in Charleston</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">PETE IACOBELLI</a></address>
      <p>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brendan-adams/">Brendan Adams</a> wasn’t afraid of the moment, not when he had to come in and take over for UConn’s injured point guard <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alterique-gilbert/">Alterique Gilbert</a> and not when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a> was slicing deep into the Huskies lead at the Charleston Classic.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brendan-adams/">Adams</a> had a career-high 20 points and played steadily in leading the Huskies to a 79-68 win over the Bulls on Thursday night. The win sets up a semifinal match with between past, present and future Big East Conference members after current league powerhouse in No. 18 Xavier romped past Towson 73-51.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brendan-adams/">Adams</a>’ play was a big reason why. Besides confidently running the team, the sophomore knocked down a huge 3-pointer with 3:47 to play after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a> (2-2) had cut a nine-point lead to 65-62.</p>
      <p>“It’s definitely the real me that you’re seeing right now. And I’m going to keep improving,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brendan-adams/">Adams</a>, a sophomore who surpassed his previous best of 15 set earlier this year against Sacred Heart. “Confidence is a big part of it.”</p>
      <p>The Huskies played like a confident bunch.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>Christian Vital had 16 points and 10 rebounds while Josh Carlton also had a double-double with 12 points and 10 rebounds.</p>
      <p>The schools will soon be league rivals as UConn has announced a return to the Big East.</p>
      <p>The Huskies rallied back from seven points down in the opening half and gained control midway through the second with a 15-9 run helped by the debut of Huskies freshman guard James Bouknight.</p>
      <p>“I thought that was big,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a> coach Jim Whitesell said.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Bouknight, who missed UConn’s first three games as he dealt with ramifications and charges from a September traffic accident, played some impactful minutes during the Huskies charge. He took a perfect pass from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brendan-adams/">Adams</a> as he skied for a layup, then fought off two defenders to put back a miss and put UConn ahead 58-49</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a> led by as many as seven points in the opening half. The Bulls were still up 32-27 with three minutes to go when the Huskies rallied to finish the half on a 7-2 surge. Vital closed things with a close-in bucket to tie the game 34-all at the half.</p>
        <p>Antwain Johnson and Josh Mballa each had 15 points to lead <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a>.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a>: The Bulls will have to wait a little longer for their next win over UConn. It’s been 68 years and counting since <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a>’s only win over the Huskies. And while that didn’t happen at TD Arena, the Bulls certainly played like a team that will once again contend for the Mid-American Conference title and a spot in the NCAA Tournament.</p>
        <p>UConn: The Huskies showed grit and skill in rallying past <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a>. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brendan-adams/">Adams</a> and Bouknight are young players that should continue to develop and give UConn coach Danny Hurley plenty to build with going forward.</p>
        <p>INJURED STARTER</p>
        <p>UConn coach Danny Hurley said it was unlikely <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alterique-gilbert/">Alterique Gilbert</a> would play the rest of he weekend after spraining his ankle. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alterique-gilbert/">Gilbert</a> wanted the chance to return in the second half, but Hurley and his medical staff kept him on the sidelines.</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a> will take on Towson here Friday night.</p>
        <p>UConn will face No. 18 Xavier in a winner’s bracket game Friday night.</p>
