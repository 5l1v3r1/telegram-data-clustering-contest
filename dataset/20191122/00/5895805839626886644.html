      <p>The Equal Rights Amendment is, once again, back in the headlines. Two states—Nevada and Illinois—have passed the amendment, bringing the total to 37, just one short of the 38 needed for ratification. Virginia, which turned blue in recent elections, is expected to be number 38.</p>
      <p>The key passage at the heart of the ERA is: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sex">sex</a>.” But is the law necessary?</p>
      <p>The ERA, if ratified, would provide a strong legal defense against a rollback of the significant advances in women's rights that have been achieved since the mid–20th century.</p>
      <p>Without the ERA women—often helped by men—regularly have to fight long, expensive, and difficult legal battles in an effort to prove that their rights are equal to those of the other sex. The <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stress</a> of unfairness—such as a persistent <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gender">gender</a> wage gap—often takes a toll on women’s emotional health.</p>
      <p>Some critics argue that we don’t need the ERA because women have done “just fine” without it.</p>
      <p>This argument completely ignores the troubling reality. Every time women make great gains, a sustained period of backlash sets in and a retreat follows regarding women’s rights.</p>
      <p>After women were granted the right to vote in 1920, the drive for more gains slowed down. It would take another 45 years for women to win the right to simply use contraception to plan their families. The women’s movement of the 1970s was followed by an extended period of “Post-feminism,” and young women avoided the term as if it were a curse word. In 1998, a Time magazine cover asked: Is Feminism Dead? The piece suggested that the answer was yes.</p>
      <p>In 1991, women were enraged over the sexist treatment of law professor Anita Hill when she testified against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas in his Senate confirmation hearing. Hill, who said that Thomas sexually harassed her, was grilled about prurient issues. Senators insisted that she name the pornographic movie Thomas allegedly recommended to her, “Long Dong Silver.”</p>
      <p>Women responded by running for office in greater numbers than in the past—and winning. Never before had four women been sent to the senate in a single election, and 1992 was dubbed “The Year of the Woman.” But mass political activism around sexual harassment mostly faded, until the #MeToo movement surfaced in 2017.</p>
      <p>Recall that in the 1970s, Phyllis Schlafly, an ardent, strident, and outspoken enemy of the ERA, issued dire predictions about the aftermath of its passage. “She warned of a dystopian post-ERA future of women forced to enlist in the military, gay <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/marriage">marriage</a>, unisex toilets everywhere and homemakers driven into the workplace by husbands free to abandon them,” noted the New York Times. Scare stories abounded. And the amendment fell short of the number of states needed for ratification.</p>
      <p>Although the amendment failed, the Times reported that, “much of what she [Schlafly] recoiled from has come to pass: abortions are intact, albeit under siege in some jurisdictions. Same-sex marriage as a right has the Supreme Court’s blessing. Unisex bathrooms are a broadly accepted fact of life, notwithstanding struggles over <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/transgender">transgender</a> rights. And women today not only fill the ranks of the military but are also eligible for combat duty.” Not exactly the horror show Schlafly predicted.</p>
      <p>But many of these changes resulted from legislation and, as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg reminds us, “legislation can be repealed, it can be altered.” <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/president-donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> has proved that maxim by reversing Obama policies that would have given 3.2 million women the right to overtime pay. The Trump presidential years have seen many attacks on both abortion and contraception, at both the state and federal levels.</p>
      <p>Among them are “heartbeat bills,” which criminalize abortion by making the procedure illegal as early as six weeks from a female’s last menstrual period.</p>
      <p>What difference would the ERA make if it were to be passed into law today? According to the New York Times, it would “guarantee equal legal rights for all American citizens regardless of sex. It would also require states to intervene in cases of gender violence, such as <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/domestic-violence">domestic violence</a> and sexual harassment; it would guard against <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/pregnancy">pregnancy</a> and motherhood <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/bias">discrimination</a>; and it would federally guarantee equal pay ... During the 1970s and 80s, Ruth Bader Ginsburg helped to persuade the Supreme Court to extend the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to prohibit unequal treatment on the basis of sex — similar to what the ERA would have done. But supporters said that clause didn’t go far enough, particularly when it comes to violence against women, sexual harassment and equal pay.”</p>
      <p>A stubborn gender gap in pay persists despite the fact that the Equal Pay Act was signed in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy. In that year, "women who worked full-time made 59 cents on average for every dollar earned by men.” Since then, women’s earnings have increased, but the National Women’s Law Center notes that the wage gap remains stubborn, with little change over the past 12 years. “In 2010, women earned 77 cents to men's dollar. That means that the wage gap has narrowed by less than half a cent per year!”</p>
      <p>The Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR) finds that “if change continues at the same slow pace as it has done for the past fifty years, it will take 41 years—or until 2059—for women to finally reach pay parity.” For women of color, the rate of change is even slower.</p>
      <p>The gender wage gap persists in spite of the passage of the Equal Pay Act. Gender discrimination, unequal opportunities for advancement, lack of federal paid parental leave and childcare assistance all contribute to the unequal status quo.</p>
      <p>Supporters of the ERA thought that Virginia would resurrect the law last February and the Washington Post noted, "celebrities, lawmakers and activists were touting its revival on Capitol Hill in Washington … But then a tiny subcommittee in Richmond—the House Privileges and Elections subcommittee—voted along party lines to block the amendment from reaching the House floor.” The Family Foundation of Virginia lobbied hard to defeat the ERA. But then came the November elections in the state, with Democrats winning majorities in both the House of Delegates and the Senate, giving them control of both houses and the governor's mansion.</p>
      <p>Justice Ginsburg, aka The Notorious RBG, made perhaps the best argument for ratification: “I would like my granddaughters, when they pick up the Constitution, to see that notion—that women and men are persons of equal stature—I’d like them to see that is a basic principle of our society.”</p>
      <p>Who can quarrel with RBG?</p>

      <p>Men are required to register for the military draft, and are subject to conscription in wartime, Women are exempted from that obligation.</p>
      <p>Women have reproductive rights. Men do not. Women can, and often do, force men into paternal obligations, even under fraudulent circumstances, such as sperm-jacking and paternity fraud.</p>
      <p>The Democrats created the Office of Women's Health in 1995, but ignored men's health, both at that time and ever since, despite the shorter male life expectancy, the four-times-greater male suicide rate, and the fact that men die at younger ages and in greater numbers from every major cause of death in the USA.</p>
      <p>The original Office of Women's Health has morphed into many of them. Still, there is no government offices for men's health.</p>
      <p>The Democrats also passed the Violence Against Women Act, and ignored violence against men, despite the research which has found that women batter men as often as the converse, and the fact that there are twice as many male victims of violent crime. The research that established equal perpetartion of domestic violence between the sexes goes back to the mid-1970s. Feminist thugs didn't want that information to get out, so they made death threats against the researchers,</p>
      <p>There are numerous programs that only benefit women in governments, in corporations, and on college campuses. Deliberate sex discrimination against men is official policy in many corporations, and is couched by terms such as "diversity".</p>
      <p>Men on college campuses that are falsely accused of sexual assault must stand trial before a feminist kangaroo court where there is no due process and no presumption of innocence. The more resilient men have sued colleges and their false accusers. Less resilient men have committed suicide.</p>
      <p>Canadian men that are falsely accused of rape can no longer admit video evidence that proves consent into evidence at their trials.</p>
      <p>Due to femicentric laws and policies, men that go through divorce face a statistical EIGHT times increase in their suicide risk, The post-divorce suicide risk for women remains unchanged.</p>
      <p>Women that can't afford to care for their children get welfare. Men that can't afford to care for their children get jail.</p>
      <p>There are many more issues, but these are just a few off the top of my head.</p>
