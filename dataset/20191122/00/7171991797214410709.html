      <h1>Echo And Reverb In A Pretty Little Box</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hackaday.com/author/lewinday/" target="_blank">Lewin Day</a></address>
      <p>These days, if there’s a chip worth using, there will be a cheap pre-built module on eBay to make using it even easier. It’s a great time saver, and projects that used to take a couple of weekends can now be completed in a rainy afternoon. [lonesoulsurfer] knows how it is, <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Echo-Reverb-Box/">and took advantage of this very approach to build this tidy echo &amp; reverb effects box.</a></p>
      <p>The build starts with a PT2399 echo/delay line module sourced of eBay, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/07/07/the-pt2399-delay-echo-chip-data-sheet-you-never-had/">a part that we’ve learned much about thanks to the hard work of others.</a> A resistor is cut off the board, enabling echo as well as reverb functionality. It’s laced up in a box with a couple of pots and a switch to control the effect, and hooked up with 6.5mm audio jacks to enable it to be easily used with guitars, synths, or karaoke machines.</p>
      <p>It’s a fun build, and one that could serve as as a useful component in a larger setup. Adding a 3PDT switch could make it more useful as a guitar pedal, or it could be integrated into a Eurorack module, too. We’d particularly love to see the results possible from stuffing five of the modules in a single box and routing them into each other in new and exciting ways. If you pull that off, <a href="http://hackaday.com/submit-a-tip">drop us a line</a>.</p>
