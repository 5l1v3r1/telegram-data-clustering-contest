      <p>Automation Anywhere, a provider of robotic process automation, on Friday said it had raised USD 290 million (Rs 2,080 crore) in funding, led by Salesforce Ventures.</p>
      <p>The series B round, which puts a post-money valuation of USD 6.8 billion on the company, also saw participation from existing investors including Softbank Investment Advisers and Goldman Sachs, a statement said.</p>
      <p>"The new capital will help Automation Anywhere accelerate its vision to empower customers to automate end-to-end business processes, bridging the gap between the front and back offices with an artificial intelligence-powered intelligent automation platform," it added.</p>
      <p>In addition, the funding will advance the company's focus on improving human-to-bot collaboration through attended automation, it said.</p>
      <p>Last year, Automation Anywhere had raised its series A investment of USD 550 million from SoftBank Investment Advisers, General Atlantic, Goldman Sachs, New Enterprise Associates (NEA), World Innovation Lab, and Workday Ventures.</p>
      <p>Robotic process automation (RPA) technology refers to the use of software robots (bots) to automate business processes that are currently managed manually by human workers.</p>
      <p>Never before has there been such a transformative shift in the way we work, with artificially intelligent software bots changing how people, processes and technology interact for productivity gains, Mihir Shukla, CEO and co-founder of Automation Anywhere, said.</p>
      <p>â€œThis new funding reinforces the promise of the RPA category and empowers our customers to achieve greater business agility and increased efficiencies by automating end-to-end business processes," he added.</p>
