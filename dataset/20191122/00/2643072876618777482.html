      <p>The minister of Aviation under the Goodluck Jonathan administration, Femi Fani-Kayode, has spoken on the effects of social media bills and hate speech bills on Nigerians.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/"><u><b>Naija News</b></u></a> had earlier reported that <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/20/social-media-bill-passes-second-reading-in-the-senate/"><u>the social media bill, on Wednesday passed the second reading in the Senate</u></a></b></p>
      <p>The bill which was sponsored by the senator representing Niger East Senatorial District, Musa Mohammed Sani is aimed at restricting cyberspace falsehood against any citizen if passed into law.</p>
      <p>The former minister while speaking on the bill on Friday claimed that the bills are threats to democracy and freedom of speech in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Fani-Kayode in his view stated Nigerians will suffer the consequences for many generations to come if the National Assembly passes the bills.</p>
      <p>The former minister who took to his Twitter account wrote, <i>“The Social Media Bill and the Hate Speech Bill are the greatest threats to democracy and freedom of expression in the history of Nigeria.”</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“If the National Assembly makes the mistake of passing either or both of these two Bills Nigerians will suffer the consequences for many generations to come and human rights, liberty and freedom will be a thing of the past in our country.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I would urge Nigerians not to view this matter with their usual indifference, complacency, docility, stoicism, and lily-livered cowardice because the whole thing is an insidious attempt to silence their tongues, cage their spirits, capture their souls, break their ability to resist tyranny and evil and finally turn them into a nation of pliant little quislings, slaves and errand boys.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“What we are witnessing is the final and greatest manifestation of the fascistic, totalitarian and authoritarian state which, like Hitler’s Germany, is creeping up and hiding under the guise of democracy.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Buhari and his friends want Nigeria to be like Stalin’s Soviet Union or, better still, like today’s North Korea and Saudi Arabia where dissent, opposition to Government, plurality of views, variety of opinion, individual rights and criticism of Government policy and the maximum dictator is forbidden and where total power is concentrated in the hands of just one man. This is the classic Orwellian nightmare and it is unfolding before our very eyes.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“If they get away with it and achieve their objectives Nigeria is finished and within a matter of years, we will become the blight of Africa, the pariah of the Third World, the laughing stock of the international community and the world’s largest prison. What a terrible fate for a person that are so compliant, so trusting, so innovative, so resourceful, so resilient and so blessed.”</i>
