      <h1>Kohli reaches another milestone after Ishant flattens sorry Bangladesh</h1>

      <p>Ishant Sharma claimed a five-wicket haul as India dismissed Bangladesh for only 106, quickly seizing control at the start of the historic day-night Test at Eden Gardens.</p>
      <p>Having hammered the Tigers in the first match of the series, India appear destined to secure a sweep after they ended a dominant opening day on 174-3, giving them a 68-run lead over their injury-hit opponents.</p>
      <p>Ishant showed a liking for the pink ball, taking 5-22 with support from Umesh Yadav (3-29) and Mohammed Shami (2-36) as the tourists were bowled out in 30.3 overs.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh also required two concussion replacements, with Mehidy Hasan and Taijul Islam replacing Liton Das and Nayeem Hasan respectively after they were struck on the helmet while batting.</p>
      <p>Virat Kohli became the first Indian - and only the sixth from any nation - to score 5,000 Test runs as captain, reaching stumps on 59 not out following a gritty 55 from team-mate Cheteshwar Pujara.</p>
