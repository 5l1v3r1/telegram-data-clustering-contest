      <h1>$50,000 Online Sales A Minute This Christmas</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/elliott-nash/" target="_blank">Elliot Nash</a></address>
      <p>Expect Christmas online retail sales to reach $50,000 a minute this Holiday period as the National Retail Association (NRA) predicts a whopping $50 billion across all retail.</p>
      <p>The utilisation of both in-store and online retail is the driving factor for this massive sale expectation, said NRA CEO Dominique Lamb, with total digital spending to reach $3.6 billion over the six weeks</p>
      <p>Lamb is predicting ‘plenty of action’ for retail stores with the NRA predicting retail expenditure to ‘easily surpass the $50 billion barriers’.</p>
      <p>Matching estimates from the Australian Retailers Association (ARA) with the executive director, Russell Zimmerman forecasting retail spending of almost $53 billion between 14 November and 24 December. </p>

      <p>It comes despite research from <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/au/en/pages/media-releases/articles/retailers-christmas-survey-2019-finding-recipe-for-success-after-challenging-year-131119.html">Deloitte</a> revealing a drop in positive sentiments for retailers with only 62% expecting to see higher sales for Christmas, down by 18% from last year.</p>
      <p>In fact, as covered by <a href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/oz-consumer-sentiment-down-still-sceptical-of-5g/"><u>ChannelNews</u></a>, 40% expect to see some form of marginal decrease during Christmas, with 39% having to introduce discounts in the lead up to the holidays as a means to help drive sales.</p>
      <p>The research does indicate a boom in online retail and impulse purchases, though many retailers appear to be ‘approaching this Christmas with a little less cheer, certainly compared to last year’.</p>
      <p>Mr Zimmerman does have his concerns warning the high sales maybe, ‘predicated on the regions’ getting lucky’ by avoiding bushfires or other natural disasters’.</p>
      <p>‘Thousands of our members – their families, their employees, their communities – are located outside major cities in areas threatened by disasters like this, so we know many of them and feel for them all’.</p>
      <p>According to NSW RFS Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers, over 400 homes have been destroyed due to bushfires, compared to only 37 houses destroyed last year.</p>
      <p>While Ms Lamb believes businesses offering ‘a unique in-store experience, coupled with a savvy online sales avenue’ will be ‘the ones who break new ground’.</p>
      <p>The NRA is so excited for Christmas and Black Friday, they’ve even set up a <a href="https://www.christmasretailaustralia.net.au/">retail site</a> with everything you need for your holiday shopping.</p>
