      <h1>Myles Garrett Releases Statement On Alleged Racial Slur: “I Know What I Heard”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T00:23:12+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 00:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>The NFL upheld Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett’s indefinite suspension today, even after Garrett accused Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph of directing a racial slur at him before Garrett swung at Rudolph with his own helmet.</p>
      <p>Garrett made the claim during a hearing with the NFL this week. Rudolph vehemently denied the allegation, <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/pittsburgh-steelers/mason-rudolphs-agent-has-fired-back-at-myles-garrett">with his agent</a> calling Garrett’s assertion “a lie.”</p>
      <p>Garrett released a statement of his own on Twitter moments ago. In it, he apologized again for his actions last Thursday, but continued to maintain he heard Rudolph use the derogatory slur.</p>
      <p>“I was assured that the hearing was space that afforded the opportunity to speak openly and honestly about the incident that led to my suspension,” Garrett said. “This was not meant for public dissemination, nor was it a convenient attempt to justify my actions or restore my image in the eyes of those I disappointed.</p>
      <p>“I know what I heard. Whether my opponent’s comment was born out of frustration or ignorance, I cannot say. But his actions do not excuse my lack of restraint in the moment, and I truly regret the impact this has had on the league, the Browns and our devoted fans.”</p>

      <p>Unless the NFL can somehow uncover on-field audio–and <a href="https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1197608670990917632">at least one report</a> says no players were mic’d up that night–it seems impossible to know whether Rudolph or Garrett is telling the truth. That’s unfortunate, because both men are being viewed with some suspicion, and at least one of them is lying.</p>
      <p>If Rudolph is guilty, what he did was disgusting. But if Garrett made it all up, not only is that reprehensible, but it didn’t even help him get his suspension reduced. Ostensibly, that would be the only reason to falsify a claim like this.</p>
      <p>Hopefully some definitive evidence emerges to determine what really happened.</p>
