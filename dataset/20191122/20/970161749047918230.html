      <p>A disgusting driver spat food into a woman’s mouth during a road rage dispute, police say.</p>
      <p>David Paul Wipperman, 61, was arrested on Thursday in connection with the vile attack on the female driver in Pinellas County, Florida.</p>
      <p>Police said Wipperman got into a road rage incident with the woman on on October 9, although it is unclear how the fight began.</p>
      <p>Wipperman reportedly got out of his Chevy S-10 truck and approached the woman in her 2014 Kia sedan.</p>
      <p>The woman rolled down her window and apologized to Wipperman, who spat food that he had been chewing into her face.</p>

      <p>Wipperman then opened the driver’s door, shouted at her and stuck his finger in her face, police said.</p>
      <p>He reportedly left after ‘a passerby interrupted the incident,’ according to the <a href="http://thesmokinggun.com/documents/revolting/mouthful-of-food-639751?fbclid=IwAR3nT26hUCjB0u7zPkHqkLjqHFO26oIlhPni9vR2GBJCJzmqOR2JDiaGkU4">Smoking Gun.</a></p>
      <p>Police did not say why it took several weeks for Wipperman to be arrested. He has since been charged with felony battery and burglary of an occupied vehicle.</p>
      <p>Wipperman was booked at the Pinellas County Jail Friday in lieu of $12,5000.</p>
      <p>According to public records, Wipperman has an extensive criminal past that includes arrests for battery ,grand theft, battery with a deadly weapon and disorderly conduct.</p>
