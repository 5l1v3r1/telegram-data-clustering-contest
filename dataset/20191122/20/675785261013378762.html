      <h1>Coronation Street fans stunned as Gary Windass detective appears on Question Time</h1>
      <h2>Coronation Street fans spotted a familiar face on Question Time on Friday evening, as Kate Rutter made an appearance</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:41:49+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:41</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Tutton</a></address>
      <p>The BBC Question Time election debate special saw an unexpected familiar face on Friday.</p>
      <p>As audience members grilled prime minister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> , Labour leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> and others over their party manifestos, one person sat in the crowd was immediately recognised by fans.</p>
      <p>As Jo Swinson took to the podium and asked for questions, Corrie fans spotted the detective involved in the factory roof collapse and Rick Neelan's vanishing act was in the audience.</p>
      <p>DS Beckett actress Kate Rutter had a question too, asking the politician about poverty and if she regretted voting with the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>She received applause from the crowd with her question, with Jo then providing her with an answer.</p>

      <p>As soon as they realised why they recognised her, fans took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> with Corrie airing at the same time as the moment on Question Time.</p>
      <p>One viewer joked: "She wants to know if Jo Swinson was responsible for the Underworld roof sabotage they have all conveniently forgotten about."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Why was a policewoman off <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> asking Jo Swindon a question?"</p>

      <p>A third added: "From arresting Carla Connor to grilling Jo Swinson on benefits, this is one busy detective."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile a fourth fan asked: "Isnâ€™t she the police detective in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/corrie?src=hashtag_click">#corrie</a> ."</p>
      <p>The actress hasn't been in Weatherfield for a while, last seen grilling Gary Windass once more.</p>
      <p>Viewers may have recognised her from other roles too on the same soap, as Kate has played three roles in total including her latest part as the detective.</p>

      <p>Viewers may know her from her former role on the show back in January 2014.</p>
      <p>While it was only a brief role, she certainly made an impact as she featured in some huge and highly emotional scenes.</p>

      <p>Kate played celebrant Susie Forrester, who met with a dying Hayley Cropper to discuss her funeral.</p>
      <p>Kate also played another brief role back in 1996, when she played solicitor Jo Marsh whose client was Liz McDonald, with Liz asking her to help her get a divorce from criminal husband Jim.</p>
