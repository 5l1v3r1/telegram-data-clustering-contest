      <p>The episode centers around the <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a29738502/queen-elizabeth-ii-children/">mother and son's strained relationship </a>, and how Princess Alicewhose nickname for Philip is "Bubbikins" (again, lol)ended up living at Buckingham Palace during her final years.</p>
      <h3>Princess Alice of Greece wasn't actually Greeklike, at all.</h3>
      <p>Even though Alice was a Grecian princess, she was actually British. Born at Windsor Castle on February 25, 1885, Alice was, in fact, the great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria. In 1903, she married Prince Andrew of Greece, and had four daughters and one son, Philip.</p>

        <h3>Her royal life was derailed by political strife.</h3>
        <p>The family lived in Greece, but by 1916, the country was in political turmoil. They were forced to leave in 1917 when Andrew's brother, King Constantine I, abdicated the throne over disagreements on whether Greece should enter World War I.</p>
        <h3>Despite some mental health difficulties, Princess Alice was a talented linguist.</h3>
        <p>Btw, Alice was deaf, but was able to speak three languagesEnglish, German, and French, according to <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=d109AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=princess+alice+speak+three+languages%E2%80%94English,+German,+and+French.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q1R-6bkxQo&amp;sig=ACfU3U1ddEYUX8WYeC_hMpYLVuzpp9BLmA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwicieO5xP7lAhUlhOAKHaxLBdQQ6AEwDnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=princess%20alice%20speak%20three%20languages%E2%80%94English%2C%20German%2C%20and%20French.&amp;f=false">The Journal of Education for Upper Canada </a>. She also supposedly suffered from schizophrenia and was forcibly committed to a sanitarium in Switzerland, per <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/entertainment/prince-philips-mother-princess-alice-interesting-facts-intl-scli/index.html">CNN </a>. She was briefly a patient of Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud, who's considered the founder of psychoanalysis.</p>
        <h3>She later dedicated her life to caring for others.</h3>
        <p>Alice recovered and went on to help protect a Jewish family during World War II, according to <a href="https://www.yadvashem.org/righteous/stories/princess-alice.html">Yad Vashem </a>. She founded an order of nuns later in life (and started wearing a habit herself), and eventually ended up leaving Greece for good.</p>
