      <h4>Eric Ikhilae, Abuja</h4>
      <p>The convener of #RevolutionNow Movement, Omoyele Sowore, has filed a fresh suit against the Department of State Services (DSS) over his continued detention despite being granted bail by a Federal High Court in Abuja.</p>
      <p>In the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/1409/2019 dated November 20, 2019 was filed before the Federal High Court, Abuja. The Director-General, DSS and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) are listed as respondents in the suit.</p>
      <p>Sowore, in the suit, accused the respondents of violating his rights by their refusal to release him, despite meeting the conditions attached to the bail granted him.</p>
      <p>He also accused the DSS of assaulting him when its personnel came to arrest him in Lagos.<br/>Sowore argued that the DSS’s failure to disclose the offence he allegedly committed and why he was arrested violated his rights.</p>
      <p>He is therefore praying the court to award N500million damages in his favour, against the respondents as compensation for the violation of his rights.</p>
