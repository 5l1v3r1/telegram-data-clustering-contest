      <h2>An estimated 10,000 enterprises worldwide are at serious risk of financial fraud thanks to critical security vulnerabilities in Oracle EBS software, notes commentator Piyush Pandey.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:58:13+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/user/429626" target="_blank">Tim Sandle</a></address>
      <p>The Oracle EBS software flaws could allow potential attackers to take full control over a company's entire enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution, exposing them to fraud and possible GDPR, CCPA and HIPAA violations. <a href="https://www.onapsis.com/blog/oracle-payday-vulnerabilities">Oracle has warned</a> of flaws in E-Business suite Two serious security vulnerabilities on Oracle's E-Business Suite could enable an attacker to run malicious code on an E-Business, <a href="https://www.itproportal.com/news/oracle-business-software-features-major-security-flaws/">according to IT Portal</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.triniti.com/oracle-ebs-software">Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS)</a> is an Internet-enabled product that can be managed from a single site, providing an integrated set of business applications for automating customer relationship management, enterprise resource planning and supply chain management processes within business organizations.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/11/20/oracle_ebs_flaws/">The Register reports</a> that security company Onapsis estimates that up to half of all companies using the Oracle EBS software have not yet patched CVE-2019-2648 and CVE-2019-2633, this is despite fixes for both bugs having been issued back in April 2019.</p>
      <p>The extent of the flaws has been picked up <a href="https://www.appsian.com/company/appsian-management/">Piyush Pandey</a>, CEO of ERP data security leader <a href="https://www.appsian.com/">Appsian</a>. He notes that says that ERP systems are particularly vulnerable to hacks, telling Digital Journal: "Unfortunately, hackers are aware that traditional ERP systems lack the granular logging and analytics features required to detect unauthorized activity."</p>
      <p>He also boils down on the seriousness of the issue: "Having a vulnerability that exploits a customer who may not be current on their security updates, raises the risk of a data breach exponentially. Organizations must take additional steps to enhance their levels of visibility and control over their ERP data - and all of the user activity taking place around it.”</p>
