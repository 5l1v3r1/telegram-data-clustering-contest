      <p>And she's continued to woo the public with a number of lucrative deals. For example, not only is she now a regular on the Loose Women panel but she's also had massive collaborations with brands such as Iceland and Primark.</p>
      <p>On top of this, Stacey also started dating fellow King of the Jungle, Joe Swash, and the pair now have baby son, Rex, together.</p>

      <p>The pair split up in 2009 but this wasn't the end of Katie's I'm A Celeb journey, as the glamour model returned to the jungle later that year to get “closure” on her dramatic breakup with Peter.</p>
      <p>However, she left after just nine days, claiming: “It's not about the money, it's not about winning for me – I just don't want to be here any more.”</p>
      <p>And even more drama followed, as Katie, 41, famously dumped her second husband, Alex Reid, live on air during her exit chat from the show.</p>
