      <h1>Ed Orgeron Has A Message For Critics Of LSU’s Defense</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:31:25+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>The LSU Tigers are the No. 1 team in the nation thanks to their revamped offense. Star quarterback Joe Burrow is the Heisman Trophy front-runner for the second-highest scoring offense in the country.</p>
      <p>However, there remain serious questions about LSU’s defense.</p>
      <p>Just last weekend, the Tigers gave up over 600 yards – 400 on the ground – and 37 points to Ole Miss. Six of LSU’s 10 opponents have scored at least 20 points, while four teams have scored at least 37 points against the Tigers.</p>
      <p>However, head coach Ed Orgeron remains confident in his defense.</p>
      <blockquote>“Hell no! I love our defense. We’re 10-0. When you talk about that other stuff, let’s block out the noise. All that stuff on TV don’t matter. We gotta play football games. We gotta focus in on the task at hand, and right now, it’s beating Arkansas, and that’s all we’re focusing on.”</blockquote>

      <p>Clearly the College Football Playoff committee isn’t worried either. LSU is the No. 1 team in the country for a reason and is likely on its way to the SEC title game.</p>
      <p>A game against Georgia in the SEC title game is likely the only thing standing in LSU’s way of a playoff berth.</p>
      <p>Will the Tigers defense hold up against top competition?</p>
