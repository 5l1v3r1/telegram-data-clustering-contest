      <p>At around 8:30 a.m. on Thursday, neighbours in Port Saint Lucie, Florida, spotted a silver sedan driving in circles around a cul-de-sac. The car <i>appeared</i> to be driverless, but there was someone behind the wheel: A dog. Specifically, a dog named Max.</p>
      <p>“I saw this car going around in a circle and it was doing it for about an hour. And when the cops got the door open, a black dog jumped out, I was like, ‘They should give that thing a licence,'” neighbour Anne Sabol told <a href="https://www.wpbf.com/">WPBF-TV.</a></p>
      <p>Port Saint Lucie Police were called to the scene. the human driver had left his dog in the running car and stepped out of the vehicle. The dog was locked inside the car, and was somehow able to put the car in reverse.</p>

      <p>Luckily, police were able to rescue the dog and the car when the car’s unnamed owner gave them the keycode to the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Incredibly, there was little damage to the neighbourhood – the dog only hit a few garbage cans, a mailbox, and some bricks. No human or dog was injured in the incident.</p>
