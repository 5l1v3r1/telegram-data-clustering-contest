      <h1>Pep Guardiola's selection dilemma as Man City face key suspension risk against Chelsea</h1>
      <h2>Manchester City take on Chelsea knowing three points is a must</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City face Chelsea on Saturday with manager Pep Guardiola knowing one of his key players risks suspension.</p>
      <p>Raheem Sterling was booked in the 2-1 win against Southampton in October to pick up his fourth yellow card of the season, and has remained on that tally since.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old is now just one yellow card away from a one-match suspension, ahead of the return of Premier League football after the international break, when Pep Guardiola's side host high-flying Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>Any player who earns five bookings from his side's first 19 Premier League matches of the season will have to serve a one-match ban in the league or a domestic cup competition.</p>
      <p>If Sterling is cautioned against Chelsea, he would then be banned for City's next league fixture against Newcastle at St James' Park.</p>
      <p>This season, Sterling has established himself as one of Guardiola's most trusted attackers, starting all but one of City's league fixtures - and scoring seven goals in the process.</p>
      <p>Despite the threat of suspension hanging over the England forward, he is almost certain to start against Frank Lampard's side given City's desperate need for three points.</p>
      <p>The reigning champions were beaten 3-1 by Liverpool before the international break, a result which leaves them nine points behind Jurgen Klopp's team.</p>
      <p>Sterling should be fresh for the game on Saturday after only playing once during the international break. The winger was dropped by Gareth Southgate for the Montenegro game at Wembley last week after the training ground bust-up with Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>But the former Liverpool winger returned for England's 4-0 win against Kosovo on Sunday, providing an assist for Marcus Rashford's goal and playing a key role in Harry Kane's opener.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the game, Three Lions boss Southgate praised Sterling's performance at the Fadil Vokrri Stadium.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://talksport.com/radioplayer/live/">talkSPORT</a>: “Well, we didn’t get a lot of the ball to him for about 55 minutes. When we did, half of them were around his neck.</p>
      <p>“I think the two bits of quality, in terms of the assists, and three or four other moments when he had the shot in the first-half, the acceleration for Harry’s goal, I mean, goodness me, the thought of being a full-back against him one against one, he’d keep you awake all night.</p>
      <p>“I’m really pleased for him and I think there is no need for us to say how important a player he is for us.”</p>
