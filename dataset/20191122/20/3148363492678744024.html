      <h1>Business Activity Accelerates Going Into Year End | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>Defying predictions of further sluggishness in the final months of 2019 and contrasting with still slumping growth around the world, business activity in the U.S. appears to be accelerating.</h2>

      <p>Growth in both manufacturing and services accelerated in November, according to the IHA Markit composite Purchasing Managers Index. The so-called composite PMI, which measures business activity by surveying executives, rose to 51.9 in November, up from 50.9 in October.</p>
      <p>That was better than economists expected. Readings above 50 indicate growth, while readings below indicate contraction.</p>
      <p>Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the improvement “adds to evidence that the worst of the economy’s recent soft patch may be behind us.</p>
      <p>The growth in manufacturing comes after months of worries that manufacturing could be entering a recession, weighed down by uncertainty over monetary and trade policies and lower global demand. IHS Markit noted that “manufacturers registered a solid rise in new orders that was the sharpest since April, with goods producers signaling a further recovery from the slowdown seen earlier in the year.”</p>
      <p>Instead of weakness in the manufacturing sector spilling over into the services sector, the recovery in manufacturing is supporting growth in services.</p>
      <p>“A recovery of manufacturing production growth to a ten-month high is especially welcome news, helping to lift service sector activity growth from recent lows,” said Williamson.</p>
