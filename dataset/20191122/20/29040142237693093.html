      <p>Mint Mobile has already kicked off its Black Friday promotion, and it's <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/carrier-deals-black-friday-cyber-monday-2019">one of the best carrier deals</a> we will see this month. The carrier is offering 12GB of data for just $15 a month, but you need to prepay for 3 months. That means you pay $45 to get three months of service, after which it renews at regular pricing.</p>

      <h4>Apple AirPods Pro</h4>
      <p>Black Friday is sure to bring <a href="https://www.imore.com/best-airpods-deals-black-friday">lots of deals to the AirPods lineup</a>, but one of the best is here right now. The recently-released AirPods Pro are already discounted at Amazon, which is a bit rare. We don't see many discounts on new Apple products, but that's not stopping these from being on sale. There is a shipping delay to make note of, though it's likely that Amazon will have stock available earlier than what's advertised.</p>

      <h3>Should you shop pre-Black Friday deals?</h3>
      <p>The answer here isn't cut and dry, but in most cases we would say yes. You should absolutely already be shopping sales and picking up things as you see them become discounted. Many retailers have already dropped their Black Friday sale advertisements, so you can easily compare the pricing listed there to what it's available for right now. If the prices match, click buy now. There is no benefit to waiting for Black Friday and risking the item selling out or forgetting to purchase it, and being stuck then paying full price.</p>
      <h3>Will Black Friday bring lower prices?</h3>
      <p>You may or may not find lower pricing than you see right now on Black Friday itself. Retailers don't show off every single item that will be available at a discount and list the price ahead of the event, unfortunately, which means you have to take a risk. You'll need to weigh your options when shopping for some stuff, but keep in mind that making the purchase now is likely less stressful, and you won't have to worry about it selling out before you complete the transaction or missing out on the price you see today.</p>
      <h3>Where should you look for Black Friday deals?</h3>
      <p>When it comes to Black Friday, just about everyone under the sun will be offering discounts. If you want to keep your searches under control, we'd recommend keeping an eye on <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals">Amazon's Black Friday</a> offerings, along with <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-buy-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals">deals at Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/walmart-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals">don't forget to check out Walmart</a> during your pricing comparisons. These retailers offer a wide variety of product assortment, and will honestly all probably be price matching each other during the lead up to Black Friday and on the big day.</p>
