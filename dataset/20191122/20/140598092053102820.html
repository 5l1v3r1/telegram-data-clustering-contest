      <h1>Eni Aluko to leave Italian champions Juventus </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:53:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-sport/" target="_blank">Telegraph Sport</a></address>
      <p>Eni Aluko will leave Juventus Women at the end of the month, she has announced in a statement via the club's website.</p>
      <p>The striker, 32, has 102 senior appearances for England and previously played for Chelsea and Birmingham City.</p>
      <p>The former England international moved to Italy from Chelsea in June 2018 and went on to win three trophies in her time at Juventus.</p>
      <p>Aluko, 32, lifted the Serie A title as well as the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana but will now be seeking a new challenge as she prepares to leave.</p>
      <p>"I have come to the difficult decision to leave Juventus in December and I want to share some words from my heart," she said in a statement posted on the club's website.</p>
      <p>"After winning the Supercoppa recently, I felt a sense of great completion with my time at Juventus, after also winning the Coppa Italia and Scudetto. I feel very fortunate to have achieved such success with all of you in my 18 months at the club.</p>
