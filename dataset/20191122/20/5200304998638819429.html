      <h1>Nandamuri Taraka Rao Junior declines role in Jayalalithaa biopic?</h1>

      <p>In the midst of finalising their cast, the makers of the forthcoming Jayalalithaa biopic titled ‘Thalaivi’ apparently approached the former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Nandamuri Taraka Rao’s grandson, Nandamuri Taraka Rao Junior, to represent him on screen. However, news has it, that the young actor turned it down.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Bollywood Hungama</i>, Junior NTR as he is fondly known was reported expressing how he could never revive the role of the person his grandfather was on screen, due to the complexities of his character being rather difficult to replicate.  </p>
      <p>Being a young actor himself, many of his films in the South have seen him play aspects of his grandfather, but it seems he’s rather hesitant in representing his grandfather as a full-fledged character.</p>
      <p>In the meantime lead actress, Kangana Ranaut is undergoing training for the role as the protagonist in the film, which is set to hit the big screen in 2020.</p>
