      <h1>BJP accused of taking funds from firm under Enforcement Directorate lens</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:41:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:41</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>The Opposition on Friday accused the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bharatiya-janata-party">Bharatiya Janata Party </a>(BJP) of receiving crores in donation from a company being probed by the ED for allegedly buying properties from Iqbal Mirchi, an accused in the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts, and asked whether or not it was a case of “treason”.</p>
      <p>Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala cited a media report which claimed the BJP took a large donation from a firm being probed by the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/enforcement-directorate">Enforcement Directorate </a>for carrying out transactions with and buying properties from the late Mirchi.</p>
      <p>The Communist Party of India also stepped up its attack on the party and said it has been “exposed”.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate response from the BJP on the allegations.</p>
      <p>The attack on the BJP came after news portal The Wire reported that the BJP had received a large donation from a company being probed by the ED for facilitating “terror funding”, citing the ruling party’s filings with the Election Commission.</p>
      <p>The report said the company, which was involved in transactions with and buying properties from the late Iqbal Memon alias Iqbal Mirchi, gave ~10 crore to the BJP in 2014-15. Mirchi was a close aide of Dawood Ibrahim.</p>
      <p>“BJP’s ‘donation saga’ gets murkier — Electoral Bond Scam to donations from accused of ‘terror funding’! Why did BJP receive Crores in donation from a Company accused of buying properties of Iqbal Mirchi, a Dawood Ibrahim aide? Is this not ‘treason’ Mr Amit Shah?” Surjewala asked in a tweet.</p>
      <p>With “links to Iqbal Mirchi, terror funding companies and a litany of organisation being investigated by the Enforcement Directorate, the BJP’s electoral bond scandal may have crossed over from corruption to treason”, the Congress added in a series of posts from its official Twitter handle.</p>
      <p>The Congress also demanded an answer on the issue from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah.</p>
