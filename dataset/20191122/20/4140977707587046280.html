          </p>
          <p>We couldn’t have asked for a more intriguing and enthralling encounter to rope in Saturday for us than today’s forthcoming encounter between to gargantuan units. When Western Conference’s Los Angeles Clippers and Houston Rockets clash heads today, this is a match which has all the ingredients imbued in place to be a jaffer of a match, a contest poised to go down into the culminating stages of the affair.</p>
          <p>It’s not only owing to the positions these two occupy in the conference and the fact that they both are challenging for the division and conference titles but the repertoire of worldclass players they come bestowed with. There’s a slew of outstanding players filled to the brim in both the side’s units, players who’ll be looking to spare no expense as they strive to embark on a win in this eagerly antic aped and awaited contest.</p>

                <p>Placed adjacent in the conference, Houston Rockets just out edge LA Clippers with the 11 wins and four defeats from 15 matches. However, the side were stalled in ther ascendancy the last time around as Denver Nuggets brought an end to their winning spree with a 105-95 win. Is something LA Clippers will be looking to capitalise on as they look to avenge their previous defeat to Houston Rockets the last time around, a match where they were defeated 102-93.</p>
                <p>They also come into the contest carrying a three match winning spree, one which includes a tenacious 107-104 win over Boston Celtics the last time around. It was a performance which saw the side engulf us in a gripping performance and lay down a real statement of intent as they showcased their true credentials with a performance brimming with guile, tenacity, fortitude, valour and vigour.</p>

                            <h3>LAC Vs HOU Dream11 Point Guard</h3>
                            <p>A person who has been responsible for laying up the ball for his counterparts and ensuring the side’s gameplan is carried out perfectly is Patrick Beverly. He’s been at the forefront of providing assists and rummaging the ball past opposition defences articulate to leave them in angst to make him our first pick for this encounter.</p>
                            <p>From the opposition meanwhile we have decided to indulge in Austin Rivers, our cheap pick for the day as we try to free up funds to invest in elsewhere. He’s bound to get a good time out on the court today and pull off some good points to make him pristine value for this one.</p>
                            <h3>LAC Vs HOU Dream11 Shooting Guard </h3>
                            <p>The most expensive docket of our Dream 11 side, the players we are picking out in this facet of our unit could end up defining the match for their outfits. We begin with James Harden from Houston Rockets, their leading scorer at the moment with the player having dropped 38.4 points and having come up with the 7.5 assists as well in the process.</p>
                            <p>From the other side we are venturing in with Kawhi Leonard, a player whose 8.6 rebounds have seen him play a dual role for his side by positioning himself under both the paints to become a pivotal figure for the side in their sublime and illustrious framework of success.</p>
                            <h3>LAC Vs HOU Dream11 Small Forward</h3>
                            <p>LA Clippers’ leading scorer at the moment with a stunning 28.3 points, Paul George was an instant pick for us in this slot of our component. The player has been in imperious touch and one of the key figures of his side’s marauding form, a performer who has laid down treys from outside the paint with effervescent ease.</p>
                            <p>Maurice Harkless is also being brought in from the side to make this segment a one-two of picks from the setup.</p>
                            <h3>LAC Vs HOU Dream11 Power Forward</h3>
                            <p>Houston Rockets find representation here in the form of P.J. Tucker. He’s been a player whose floating jump points, quick break points and ability to scrimmage on the court succulently have seen him become a stalwart of his side.</p>
                            <h3>LAC Vs HOU Dream11 Centre</h3>
                            <p>Tyson Chandler will be our last player being imbedded in this component of our Dream 11 unit with the Houston Rockets’ centre wrapping up proceedings for today’s upcoming outing.</p>
                            <h3>Star Player</h3>
                            <p>We have decided to make Leonard our side’s star player for this contest.</p>
