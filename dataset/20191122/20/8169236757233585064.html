      <h1>Mourinho’s arrival could allow Christian Eriksen to move in January</h1>

        <b>When Jose Mourinho takes over at a new club you always expect some movement in the playing squad. It’s still not clear if he will have money to spend, but it still looks like some players could be on the move.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Juventus are well known for pulling off some incredible free transfers. Paul Pogba, Andrea Pirlo, Aaron Ramsey and Sami Khedira have all moved to Turin for no fee over the years, and it looked like Christian Erisken was being lined up as the next one.</p>

      <p>A report from <a href="https://www.football-italia.net/146739/juve-go-eriksen-january">Football Italia</a> has indicated that Juve were looking to sign him next Summer, but Mourinho’s arrival could lead to a change of plans.</p>
      <p>They quote a story from Corriere Dello Sport in saying that although Juve were willing to wait, it seems that Mourinho wouldn’t stand in the way of letting the Dane leave in January, so it means Spurs could at least get some sort of fee for him.</p>

      <p>They go on to say that Manchester United and Real Madrid are also interested in him, so it’s not a foregone conclusion that he will end up in Italy.</p>
      <p>Eriksen was highly rated when he arrived from Ajax in 2013, and he’s gone one to become one of the best midfielders in the world. His elegance and decisiveness on the ball make him an attractive proposition for any side, so it’s understandable that there’s so much interest in him.</p>
      <p>He’s only nine games short of reaching the 300 mark for Spurs, but it seems unlikely that he will reach that total now. It will be interesting to see if he features in any of the squads under Jose Mourinho in the next few games.</p>
      <p>It seems clear that he would be happy to let him go, but it remains to be seen if he will be frozen out completely. It certainly looks like he will be on the move in the next few months, we just don’t know where he will end up or when it will happen.</p>
