      <h1>Michigan at Indiana: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:36:23+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Saturday’s Big Ten contest between <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-12">No. 13 Michigan</a> and Indiana features two red-hot teams. The Wolverines and Hoosiers have each won four of their last five games. Michigan will have to be careful facing an Indiana team that is not to be taken lightly.</p>
      <p>The Wolverines are 8-2, vying for a New Year’s Six bowl selection later this season. Next Saturday’s contest against No. 2 Ohio State looms large in the eyes of all Michigan players, coaches and fans. But looking ahead to that massive contest could spell trouble in regards to an upset on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Hoosiers have exceeded all expectations so far this season. Sitting at 7-3, Indiana has a chance to reach nine regular season wins and a 10th win with a bowl game victory. This game could mean much more to the Hoosiers than it does for the Wolverines. And with Indiana’s home crowd advantage, can the Hoosiers pull off the upset on Saturday?</p>

      <p><b>Announcers: </b>Sean McDonough, Todd Blackledge</p>
      <p>Vegas’ oddsmakers don’t anticipate an upset on Saturday, as the Wolverines are  9.5-point favorites over Indiana, despite going on the road. The game’s over/under is set at 54.5.</p>
