        <b>UPDATE(November 22, 2019):</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thought to be the latest collaboration between <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/lebron-james">LeBron James</a>, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nike">Nike</a> and Harlem, NY-based Harlem Fashion Row, this LeBron 17 is in fact an in-line makeup dubbed “Win-Win.” Designed with assistance from the women’s basketball teams at Christ the King High School, Fairfax High School and LeBron’s alma mater St. Vincent-St. Mary — three schools that the King has consistently supported — the shoe interpolates each team’s signature colors in a unique fashion, a nod to how the next generation of hoopers inspires LeBron’s game. The gold and red upper draws from CTK and Fairfax’s uniforms, while SVSM’s recognizable green and gold hues are somewhat surprisingly relegated to accents on the upper’s small tags and the insole.</p>
      <p>The Nike LeBron 17 “Win-Win” will release in an extended size run on December 7 via <a href="https://www.nike.com/launch/t/lebron-17-win-win/">Nike SNKRS</a>. The MSRP is set at $225 USD.</p>

        <b>ORIGINAL STORY (November 17, 2019):</b>
      </p>
      <p>Following a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/5/nike-lebron-16-hfr-harlem-stage-drop-2-release">zesty yellow collaborative LeBron 16</a> earlier this year, esteemed <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/harlem-fashion-row">Harlem’s Fashion Row</a> has once again linked up with <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nike">Nike</a> for yet another silhouette from the basketball player’s line, this time opting for the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nike-lebron-17">LeBron 17</a>.</p>
      <p>Giving the iconic model a premium makeover, HFR’s take dresses the upper with a beige Knitposite material, with a matching-colored tongue and laces. Gradually moving down the lateral and onto the rear of the sneaker are gold and red accents, providing a welcome contrast with colors worthy of King James himself. Further down, a light beige midsole is complemented with a gold Swoosh logo alongside a Max Air unit, wrapped up by a translucent outsole. Tying the entire royal look together, however, is the 3D lion head on the tongue, replacing the usual embroidered version of the icon.</p>
      <p>For those interested, the latest Harlem’s Fashion Row x Nike LeBron 17 will be available over at <a href="https://www.nike.com/">Nike’s online store</a> and select retailers on December 7.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in footwear, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/air-jordan-4-what-the-ci1184-146-release-date">Jordan Brand has dropped an Air Jordan 4 in a “What The” colorway</a>.</p>
