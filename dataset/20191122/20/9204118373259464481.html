      <p>Petrofac Ltd. (St. Helier, U.K.; <a href="http://www.petrofac.com/">www.petrofac.com</a>)  has announced that its Engineering &amp; Production Services (EPS) segment has secured its first small-scale Engineering, Procurement, Construction (EPC) contract in Malaysia. In consortium with partner Serba Dinamik, EPS has been awarded a contract by Asean Bintulu Fertiliser (ABF) Sdn Bhd, one of Malaysia’s largest fertilizer plants, for its Third Boiler Project. The ABF plant located in the central region of Sarawak, which started commercial production in 1985, is a subsidiary of PETRONAS Chemicals Group Berhad. The work scope for the 30-month project includes basic and detailed engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of an additional package boiler (165 tons per hour) to improve overall plant reliability and availability and meet total steam demands of 510 ton/h.</p>
      <p>John Pearson, Chief Operating Officer, Engineering and Production Services, said: “Continued diversification into new markets, such as brownfield projects, and new geographies, such as Malaysia, are key tenets of our growth strategy. We’re also once again delighted that clients in the North Sea have exercised the option to extend our support for important Operations and Maintenance and Engineering Services contracts.”</p>
