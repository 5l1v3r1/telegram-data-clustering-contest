      <h1>Tesla's Cybertruck has become the butt of internet jokes</h1>
      <h2>Windows broke during demonstration of glass</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:30:53+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author">Matt McFarland, CNN Business</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - Just when it seemed like things couldn't get worse for Tesla after the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/22/cars/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-truck/index.html">botched unveiling</a> of its Cybertruck, the internet weighed in.</p>
      <p>Tesla had already been embarrassed when two of the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2019/11/22/tesla-cybertruck-orig-gr.cnn">truck's windows broke</a> during a demonstration meant to show how strong the glass was. That proved to be the least of the indignities suffered by Tesla's newest vehicle.</p>
      <p>Broken windows aside, the Cybertruck's distinct design has inspired far-ranging, creative barbs. Tesla, the company that made electric cars cool and sleek, may have misfired on its pickup.</p>
      <p>"Looks like a pinewood derby car gone wrong," said one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dzuegh/tesla_cyber_truck_cybrtrk_unveil_event_megathread/f8akd6s/">Reddit user</a>.</p>
      <p>The angular style has been compared to everything from a <a href="https://twitter.com/mark_bril/status/1197864718691700736">doorstop</a> or an old <a href="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?quality=85&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blogcdn.com%2Fmedia%2F2012%2F08%2Fwrielessapple2emouse.jpg&amp;client=amp-blogside-v2&amp;signature=996bd54fad483a2e5d1c89f80cb0440a3e034729">Apple Mouse</a> to the SpongeBob Squarepants character <a href="https://twitter.com/Kaden_Bailey16/status/1197738171221590017">Flats the Flounder</a>, or a <a href="https://twitter.com/yadeer_/status/1197736994589175809">triangle on wheels</a>.</p>
      <p>Others <a href="https://twitter.com/H_mbrgers/status/1197817179288330240">likened</a> the Cybertruck to "The Homer," an overwrought, ugly station wagon that Homer Simpson designed on the long-running sitcom, The Simpsons. The vehicle bankrupt Simpson's brother. Some even described the Cybertruck as the lovechild of a <a href="https://twitter.com/Topl_NickE/status/1197740095945752578">DeLorean, of "Back to the Future" fame, and an El Camino</a>.</p>
      <p>Bottom line, those sharp contours on the Cybertruck are making people cringe.</p>
      <p>"I cut my eyes just looking at the new cybertruck," said one <a href="https://twitter.com/Jack_Septic_Eye/status/1197889555925475328">Twitter user.</a></p>
      <p>There are plenty of questions about whether pickup truck buyers will have any interest in the latest Tesla.</p>
      <p>James Cobb, a retired University of Georgia history professor who has studied southern culture and grew up hauling cotton in a pickup truck, said it'll take time to potentially win over truck owners.</p>
      <p>"There's a certain level of boldness and self-confidence required to really be that person," Cobb said. "When you go for one of these, you're making a statement that you're either moving on from that culture or trying to one up it."</p>
      <p>Cobb has watched pickups evolve from practical, utilitarian vehicles, to a way for owners to make a statement about themselves. As people moved from rural to suburban settings, he said embracing pickups was a way to chafe at suburban conformity, and feel an affinity for one's country roots.</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck's design may actually distract from its major selling point: It's electric. But there are other challenges too. Established competitors including Ford and GM are developing electric trucks, and already have legions of loyal pickup owners. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/cars/gm-electric-pickup/index.html">GM said this week</a> it plans to sell its first all-electric truck in the fall of 2021.</p>
      <p>Musk started talking publicly about a pickup truck in 2013. Tesla hasn't said when deliveries will start, but that production will near in late 2021. Prices start at $39,900 and can exceed $70,000, with certain options such as a larger battery and Autopilot.</p>
      <p>Berk Talay, a marketing professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, believes it's too early to tell how consumers will ultimately react to the truck.</p>
      <p>"We might expect, just as with any radical innovation in the tech industry, to see some super fans and super skeptics," Talay said.</p>
      <p>So far, the skeptics are speaking loudest.</p>
