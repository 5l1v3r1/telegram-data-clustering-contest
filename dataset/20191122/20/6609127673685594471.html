        <b>JEREMY Corbyn tonight vowed to take a neutral stance in a second EU referendum as an election debate audience groaned at his Brexit dithering.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Labour leader was also slated for his “nice old grandpa” act as voters attacked him over his flagship constitutional policy.</p>

      <p>And he dropped a heavy hint that he could allow IndyRef2 if there’s an SNP majority in the 2021 Scottish parliament election.</p>
      <p>But Mr Corbyn later faced criticism for the time-block from Nicola Sturgeon, who was grilled second in the Question Time special which also featured Lib Dem Jo Swinson, then Boris Johnson.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn’s neutral Brexit pledge came as he was pushed repeatedly on why how he’d vote a second EU referendum.</p>
      <p>He said his “whole strategy has been to try to bring people together”. And there were jeers as he tried to explain Labour’s policy to strike a new exit deal and put it to a public vote.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn snapped: “Let me finish please!” And confirming for the first time he would remain on the fence in a second Brexit vote, he said: “I will adopt, if I am Prime Minister at the time, a neutral stance so I can credibly carry out the result of that to bring our communities and country together rather continuing endless debate about the EU and Brexit.”</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn was quizzed by sceptical voters over his bid to nationalise utilities, and abour claims of anti-semitism - and him not failing to clamp down on anti-Jewish members.</p>
      <p>A man asked the Labour leader “why would you chat happily” to a man who heckled Jewish MP Ruth Smeeth after at a press conference he’d seen online.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn replied that “nobody” should suffer “any abuse in public life or privately”.</p>
      <p>But the man said: “I look at a video... and there you are at the end of the press conference chatting happily to that same heckler.</p>
      <p>"I don’t buy this nice old grandpa, I see that video and that tells me all I need to know.”</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn later repeated his claim that Labour would not allow IndyRef2 in the “early years, first two years, at least” of his Government - but suggested a SNP majority in the 2021 Holyrood election could be enough for a vote.</p>
      <p>But in the second of the four 30 minute grillings, Ms Sturgeon refused to say what she’d do if she was denied permission for IndyRef2, which she says she wants in 2020.</p>
      <p>Told by host Fiona Bruce that the UK Government had a right to block a referendum, Mr Sturgeon said: “I don’t think they’ve got a moral or a democratic right-”</p>

      <p>Ms Bruce cut in and said they had a legal right to block it. But adding weight to claims from other SNP chiefs that a court challenge could follow, Ms Sturgeon said: “It’s never been legally challenged but I’ve always accepted and I continue to accept that the transfer of power is necessary and desirable.”</p>
      <p>Later, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson was quizzed on whether it was realistic she could be PM. She refused to back down despite audience chuckles, saying: “We do live in a world where strange things happen in politics.”</p>
      <p>Later, Boris Johnson was booed as he came onto stage for the Question Time special and told he’d fuelled “racist rhetoric”.<br/>He was immediately confronted by an audience member about fibs after she asked if it was important politicians “always tell the truth”.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said it was “vital” but faced groans for blaming the “corrosion of trust in politics” on “the failure of politicians to deliver Brexit”.<br/>He was later challenged on “racist” comments in past articles about Muslim women looking like letterboxes, “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles”, and a mention of “tank topped bumboys”.<br/>The PM said if people “go through all my articles with a fine tooth comb” then “things can be made to seem offensive”. But insisted he’d always stood up for equality.<br/>He was also grilled over so-called WASPI women being made to keep on working due to the retirement age rise. The PM said it was “very expensive to come up with the solution” that campaigners want, adding: “I can’t promise that I will magic up that money for you tonight.”</p>
