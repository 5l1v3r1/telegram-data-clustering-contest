      <h1>Chelsea hero explains why Fikayo Tomori is already better than Man United's Harry Maguire</h1>
      <h2>Fikayo Tomori has made an impressive ascent at Chelsea during the 2019/20 campaign</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:15:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:15</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Former Chelsea defender Frank Sinclair has provided a prediction about <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/fikayo-tomori">Fikayo Tomori</a> that fans will love.</p>
      <p>Tomori has come on leaps and bounds this season after spending last term at Derby County, while he also featured for the likes of Hull City and Brighton.</p>
      <p>But the 2019/20 campaign has seen a significant ascent from the centre-back, who is now not only starting for <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a>, he has also broken his duck for England.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old is well respected in the Chelsea dressing room and the same can be said about England, with manager Gareth Southgate quick to offer the young gun a chance to shine in the Euro 2020 qualifier against Kosovo.</p>
      <p>But Sinclair feels that Tomori can go way beyond simply making the odd appearance for England.</p>
      <p>He feels that the pacey defender has what it takes to be a regular, while he insists that Tomori is already better than fellow centre-back Harry Maguire of Manchester United.</p>
      <p>"Tomori has been great this season. He had a terrific experience at Derby. He made a big impact but that doesn't always tell the correct story about whether he can step up," Sinclair, who was speaking on behalf of GentingBet, told football.london.</p>
      <p>"He has been a massive part of how well Chelsea have been defensively in recent times. He has a lot of pace, he's good on the ball and he's great in one vs one situations. He is a player who has been talked about for a long time and it's no surprise that he's been talked about for England.</p>
      <p>"I think he should be in the England squad and playing regularly. I think Tomori is a better player than all of them and that includes Harry Maguire.</p>
