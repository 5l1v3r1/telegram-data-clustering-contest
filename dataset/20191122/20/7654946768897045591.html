      <h1>Slowdown strikes Brooklyn buses as MTA contract talks wear on</h1>

      <p>A workers’ “rulebook” slowdown disrupted service for thousands of riders on more than a dozen Brooklyn bus lines Friday morning as contract talks between the MTA and its biggest union wear on.</p>
      <p>The slowdown comes just days after <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/subway-workers-threaten-holiday-slowdown-as-mta-contract-talks-heat-up/">The Post revealed</a> that angry transit workers are organizing slowdowns to up pressure on MTA management — including possibly next week on Black Friday, the year’s busiest holiday shopping day.</p>
      <p>The MTA struggled to dispatch the B1, B4, B8, B9, B11, B16, B35, B35-LTD, B37, B43, B61, B63, B67, B68, B69, and B70 routes Friday morning because drivers requested safety inspections before the buses could leave the yard.</p>
      <p>That forced management to recheck each bus before it could pull out of the Jackie Gleason Bus Depot in Sunset Park.</p>
      <p>NYC Transit confirmed in a tweet the bus delays were caused by “unscheduled routine inspections.”</p>
      <p>It added: “Please allow extra travel time.”</p>
      <p>National Transportation Workers Union President John Samuelsen confirmed that transit workers were conducting inspections “which we are obligated to do” by law and caused a slowdown in service.</p>
      <p>He denied the union played any role Friday morning’s subway meltdown that included the emergency activation of a train’s brakes near the Grand Street station at the foot of the Manhattan Bridge. That, in turn, resulted in heavy delays that spilled across the A, B, C, D, F, N, Q and R service between Brooklyn and the city.</p>
      <p>Transit workers represented by TWU Local 100 are mired in contract talks with the MTA.</p>
      <p>Samuelsen defended the worker actions at the Gleason depot as justified and legal.</p>
      <p>“There wouldn’t be a slowdown if DOT didn’t find defects,” he said.</p>
      <p>The MTA’s city transit boss, Andy Byford, fired back in a statement — but stopped short of saying it was illegal.</p>
      <p>“Any action by TWU Local 100 that slows down bus service for riders in Brooklyn or anywhere in NYC is not acceptable,” Byford said. “Delaying dozens of buses this morning was unnecessary, inconveniencing New Yorkers just trying to get to work, school, doctors, and hospitals.”</p>
      <p>The TWU Local 100 has ramped up its attacks on MTA leadership after talks broke down again last week. The contract for its 40,000 subway and bus workers expired in May.</p>
      <p>The financially strapped MTA and the TWU are at odds over compensation, health benefits and work rules — including new efforts to reign in overtime.</p>
      <p>The TWU is prohibited by state law from striking or otherwise slowing work.</p>
      <p>In 2005, the union was hit with stiff penalties — including the loss of automatic dues collection from workers’ paychecks — after it launched an illegal strike when talks broke down during the Christmas shopping season.</p>
