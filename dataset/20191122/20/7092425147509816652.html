        <b>US President Donald Trump's latest comments on the impeachment inquiry were typically bullish as he claimed he'd welcome a trial.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Frankly, I want a trial," Trump told the Fox and Friends programme.</p>
      <p>However, he doesn't think the House of Representatives will impeach him.</p>
      <p>"I think it's very hard for them to impeach you if they have absolutely nothing," Trump said.</p>
      <p>His comments follow two weeks of public hearings with 12 witnesses involved in the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>The Democratic-led House is investigating whether Trump abused the power of office by pushing Ukraine to investigate a political rival.</p>

      <p>The trial is centred on a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25.</p>
      <p>Trump asked his counterpart to launch an investigation into former US Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.</p>
      <p>Biden is a 2020 Democratic presidential frontrunner.</p>
      <p>Testimony revealed that the administration was also pushing for an investigation into a debunked conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that meddled in the 2016 US presidential election.</p>
      <p>Fiona Hill, a former Russia expert in the White House, debunked the Ukrainian theory today.</p>
