      <h1>Injury Update For Steelers WR JuJu Smith-Schuster</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:24:39+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>The Steelers are looking to bounce back after their disastrous defeat and subsequent brawl against the Browns two Thursdays ago. But Pittsburgh will be without one of its offensive stars against the Bengals on Sunday: wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster. This could spell trouble for QB Mason Rudolph and the Steelers.</p>
      <p>Smith-Schuster has officially been ruled out for Sunday’s AFC North Division contest. ESPN’s Adam Schefter was first to report the news.</p>
      <p>As listed in the report, running back James Conner – who’s dealt with multiple injuries this season – will miss Sunday’s game as well. The Steelers’ offense will have to find some answers to avoid an upset on Sunday.</p>

      <p>JuJu Smith-Schuster <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/pittsburgh-steelers/video-steelers-wr-juju-smith-schuster-leaves-after-nasty-collision">suffered a concussion</a> and knee contusion against the Browns a little over a week ago. The game was as physical a game there’s been this season, and the star receiver paid the price for the Browns’ aggressive defensive performance.</p>
      <p>Conner re-aggravated his shoulder injury, also exiting the game against the Browns. The Steelers running back has missed multiple games this season with the same injury.</p>
      <p>Pittsburgh has to be careful on Sunday to avoid an upset at the hands of a desperate Cincinnati team. The Bengals are 0-10, but have been competitive in several of their last few contests.</p>
      <p>Steelers-Bengals kicks off this Sunday at 1 p.m. ET on CBS.</p>
