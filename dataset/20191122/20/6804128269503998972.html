      <h1>The Premier League title claim that Chelsea fans will relish ahead of Man City clash</h1>
      <h2>Man City host Chelsea on Saturday evening in the Premier League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Former Chelsea defender Frank Sinclair has made a Premier League title related claim about the clash between Frank Lampard's men and Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's side host <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> on Saturday in battle between two clubs comfortably in the top four.</p>
      <p>But so much more was expected of two-time champions City, who trail league leaders Liverpool by nine points after losing 3-1 at Anfield earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Chelsea, however, have surprised many by seamlessly dealing with <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/frank-lampard">Frank Lampard</a>'s debut season and a transfer ban, with the Londoners having won their last six league games.</p>
      <p>Sinclair, however, feels the true test of Lampard's team will come at the Etihad Stadium and he says only if they successfully pass the challenge will they be truly in a title race.</p>
      <p>"Many people say that Chelsea have not really been tested this season. When they have played against one of the so called big clubs they struggled. They lost 4-0 at Manchester United," Sinclair, who was speaking on behalf of GentingBet, told football.london.</p>
      <p>"The question that needs to be answered is whether they can step it up against one of the top sides. We should learn what they are about.</p>
      <p>"There will be some small margins in the game. It will not be easy but if they do win this game, they can look at challenging for the title.</p>
      <p>"The pressure is on Man City after their match in the Premier League when they went down at Liverpool.</p>
      <p>"Chelsea have got an opportunity to go to Man City when it is really good to play them and go for a win.</p>
      <p>"We have not been able to say that confidently over the last couple of seasons that Chelsea can go to Man City and get a result. The way they're playing, they can certainly do that and I think Lampard's side will win 2-1."</p>
      <p>Only Arsenal inside the top nine teams in the Premier League have conceded as many goals as Chelsea, though the Blues' defence has improved of late.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, City have scored six more goals than any other top-tier team, with Sinclair well aware of the challenge his old side face.</p>

      <p>"Regardless of who plays up front, we know that Man City's strength is in their front three. They are always going to test you defensively," Sinclair added.</p>
      <p>"Chelsea didn't start very well from that perspective this season but they are in good form from that perspective. (Fikayo) Tomori and (Kurt) Zouma have been great in the centre-back roles."</p>
