      <p>Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky will start Sunday’s game against the New York Giants in Chicago.</p>
      <p>Trubisky, pulled in the second half of last week’s loss to the Los Angeles Rams with a hip pointer injury, was able to practice Wednesday through Friday and convinced head coach Matt Nagy he was ready to go.</p>
      <p>The Bears removed Trubisky from the injury report entirely Friday.</p>
      <p>Nagy fended off questions in Los Angeles about Trubisky’s performance and insisted the in-game switch at quarterback was not performance-driven.</p>
      <p>“We’re not where we want to be,” Nagy allowed Thursday. “”I’m going to go back to what I really like - and what I’m sticking to and what I believe in - is the last two weeks, he’s growing in the right direction. So that’s where we’re at and ... we want to put a good week together, get him healthy and hopefully get him out there this weekend to do it again.”</p>
      <p>Among qualified quarterbacks, Trubisky is last in the NFL in passing yards per game at 175.6.</p>
      <p>The Bears ruled out tight end Adam Shaheen (foot) and linebacker Danny Trevathan (elbow). Linebacker Isaiah Irving (quadriceps) is questionable.</p>
