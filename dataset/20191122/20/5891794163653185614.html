      <h1>German Rights Commissioner Urges Release Of Iranian Conservationists</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:50:51+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:50</time> by <a rel="author">RFE/RL</a></address>
      <p>Germany's most senior human rights official has expressed "shock" at the recent sentencing in Iran of six members of a local wildlife conservation group to lengthy prison terms on charges of espionage.</p>
      <p>Baerbel Kofler, a lawmaker and the German federal government's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid, also called for the activists' immediate release.</p>
      <p>"I am shocked," Kofler said on November 22 of the verdict against the members of the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation, according to dpa. "They peacefully and actively took a stand for animal and species protection in Iran."</p>
      <p>Relatives reportedly said the six conservationists were ordered by the Tehran Revolutionary Court to spend between six and 10 years in prison in the internationally criticized case.</p>
      <p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) <b><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/11/22/iran-environmentalists-sentenced">said</a></b> the defendants were informed of the verdict on November 20.</p>
      <p>The 63-year-old managing director of the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation, Iranian-Canadian Kavous Seyed Emami, died in custody under disputed circumstances after his arrest.</p>
      <p>Iran's authorities called that a suicide, a claim that has been challenged by Emami's family and acquaintances.</p>
      <p>Authorities said the group had collected classified information about Iran's strategic areas under the pretext of carrying out environmental and scientific projects, including with the use of camera traps.</p>
      <p>Iran's courts rarely publicize verdicts, but the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) said on November 21 that the defendants had been sentenced for "contacts with the U.S. enemy state."</p>
      <p>Morad Tahbaz -- an Iranian, U.S., and British citizen -- and Niloufar Bayani received 10-year prison sentences, Taher Ghadirian and Houman Jokar got eight years, and Amirhossein Khaleghi and Sepideh Kashani got six years, relatives said.</p>
      <p>Two other wildlife conservationists held since January 2018 have yet to be handed verdicts, the CHRI said.</p>
      <p>HRW called the accusations "ridiculous," and Amnesty International cited evidence that the conservationists were tortured to extract forced "confessions."</p>
      <p>The CHRI's executive director called them "sham convictions."</p>
