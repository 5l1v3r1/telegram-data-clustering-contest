      <h1>Joe Biden's newest endorsement seems to be a slap in the face to Pete Buttigieg</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:02:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/" target="_blank">Kathryn Krawczyk</a></address>
      <p>That one's gotta hurt.</p>
      <p>On Friday, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeneps/status/1197938269092294657">former Vice President Joe Biden announced</a> that he'd earned the endorsement of Oliver Davis Jr., a black community leader in Indiana. The endorsement got some heavy play for someone who's not even close to a national political figure â€” but all makes sense considering Davis is from Pete Buttigieg's hometown.</p>
      <p>Davis is the vice president of the common council in South Bend, Indiana, where Buttigieg is mayor. In fact, Davis even <a href="https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/politics/mayoral-candidate-oliver-davis-says-his-work-has-helped-push/article_1d83a8e2-54e0-57cf-ac4d-d4f6a0f885a1.html">ran for mayor</a> earlier this year after Buttigieg declined to run, but couldn't beat the 4,447 votes that Buttigieg's chief of staff earned to clinch the Democratic nomination. Still, Davis is one of the longest-serving members of the city's common council, and focused on Biden's long tenure in his endorsement. "In times like these, when the political winds are fiercely blowing across our country, it's important for us to have an experienced leader who has been through the diverse storms of life to guide our country," he said.</p>
      <p>It's hard not to read that as a shot at Buttigieg, who is 40 years Biden's junior and has faced major criticism over his lack of political and life experience and <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/879385/pete-buttigiegs-selfinflicted-black-voter-problem">dismal showing</a> among black voters. And if that weren't enough of a blow, Biden was sure to point out that Davis "joins two other African American elected officials from Indiana" in backing Biden as well.</p>
