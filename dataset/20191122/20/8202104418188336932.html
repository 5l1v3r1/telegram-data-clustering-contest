      <p>Paramedics took both men to hospital, where one was pronounced dead. An RCMP release stated that the other man was treated for “serious but non-life threatening injuries.”</p>
      <p>Names of the two men were not released.</p>
      <p>The incident is not believed to be random. RCMP said investigators are working alongside a forensics team brought in from the Prince Albert police service, as well as members of the RCMP’s major crimes unit for northern Saskatchewan and a police canine unit out of North Battleford.</p>
      <p>Police said Thursday that an area along Mikisiw Drive was going to be blocked off for an undetermined amount of time to allow investigators to work at the scene.</p>
      <p>An autopsy for the dead man is scheduled for Friday morning in Saskatoon.</p>
      <p>Air Ronge is located 375 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon.</p>
