      <p>Pemberton was responsible for developing Maguire during his time with the Blades before he left for Hull City in 2014.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>The Athletic</i>, the former academy boss at Bramall Lane said that he convinced the England centre-back to change into a more defensive role after telling him that he wasn't good enough to play in midfield.</p>
      <p>Pemberton said: "Harry was playing centre midfield when I first met him. The problem for me was I just didn't see his future there. He was a centre-half to me.</p>
      <p>"I remember sitting him down in my office. We had quite a few chats over the years, mainly because he liked asking questions about the game. Anyway, this time I ended up asking him, 'Where do you see yourself in three years' time?' He said the first team but I pushed him on a position. He thought centre midfield but I said, 'No'.</p>
      <p>"Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard were the elite midfielders in the Premier League at the time and I told Harry he would never be as good at that position as them."</p>
      <p>Maguire has made 15 appearances for United since his Â£80m summer move from Leicester City.</p>
