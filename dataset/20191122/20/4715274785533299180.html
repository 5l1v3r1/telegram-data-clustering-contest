      <p>Grab Philippines on Friday said some three million passengers will get refund in the coming days after the Philippine Competition Commissions found out that the ride-hailing firm breached its pricing commitments.</p>
      <p>“We have always taken the position to work closely with government regulators such as the Philippine Competition Commission and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to provide the best possible service to our consumers while protecting their interests and welfare,” Grab said. </p>
      <p>To this end, Grab will abide by the PCC’s order to paying the P23.45 million  fine of which P5.05 million will go to our consumers; and recognizing the value of our tens of thousands of driver-partners, the entire fine be borne solely by Grab, as any which have been imposed in the past and in any of our markets,” it added. </p>
      <p>Grab Philippines president Brian Cu said around three million passengers took the trip from February to May 2019. </p>
      <p>“So, you take P5 million over 3 million [passengers] and the average a passenger can get is P1.50. There are some who will get below a peso while some will get over a hundred pesos (depending on the number of trips),” he added. </p>
