        <b>Jeremy Corbyn has said he will take a “neutral stance” in a second EU referendum as Prime Minister if Labour form the next government.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Labour leader said he would not campaign either for a new Brexit deal negotiated by his own government, or to remain in the EU.</p>

      <p>Labour members agreed at their conference in September that there would be a special conference to decide which way the party would campaign in the event of a second EU referendum.</p>
      <p>However, taking part in a BBC Question Time election special, Mr Corbyn revealed he would not be bound by that process.</p>
      <p>“I will adopt, if I am Prime Minister at the time, a neutral stance so I can credibly carry out the result of that to bring our communities and country together rather continuing endless debate about the EU and Brexit,” he told the programme broadcast .</p>
      <p>The Labour leader also confirmed that he may be willing to grant the powers to hold a second independence referendum as early as 2021.</p>
      <p>“There are parliamentary election in Scotland in 2021, and obviously an expression will come from that,” Mr Corbyn said.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader said he would not support a new referendum on Scottish independence in the "early years" of an administration.</p>
      <p>He said: "In the early years of a Labour government we will not be supporting an independence referendum, instead we will be investing in Scotland."</p>
      <p>Pressed on what the term "early years" meant, the Labour leader said: "The early years, first two years, at least."</p>
      <p>Nicola Sturgeon followed the Labour leader, and cast doubt on whether Mr Corbyn would hold firm against a referendum in Scotland in 2020 if the SNP’s support was essential to forming a government.</p>
      <p>She said: "Do you think he's going to walk away from the chance to end austerity, to protect the NHS, stop Universal Credit, simply because he wants for a couple of years to prevent Scotland having the right to self-determination?</p>
      <p>"I'm not sure he's going to compromise the chance to have a Labour government for that issue."</p>

      <p>A Conservative Party spokeswoman said: “Jeremy Corbyn has just confirmed that he has no plan for Brexit - he will not even say if he thinks we should leave or remain.</p>
      <p>“All he offers is months and months of dither and delay followed by the chaos of another two referendums.”</p>
