      <h1>Incoming UK Athletics chief faces questions over husband's coaching past</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:35:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/ben-rumsby0/" target="_blank">Ben Rumsby</a></address>
      <p>The new chief executive of UK Athletics was fighting to hold on to her job before she even starts amid “extremely serious” accusations her husband was allowed to continue coaching at a club where she was vice-chair despite being banned from teaching over an “inappropriate relationship” with a 15-year-old schoolgirl.</p>
      <p>Zara Hyde Peters, a former Great Britain distance runner who is due to take up her almost £200,000-a-year position in eight days, faced an investigation over husband Mike Peters’ allegedly unlicensed coaching of athletes and management of a senior track-and-field team that included girls as young as 16, for which he had not undergone proper vetting.</p>
      <p>Peters was allowed to continue operating at Coventry Godiva Harriers despite being permanently barred from teaching in October 2012 over what a damning judgment found to be “very serious” misconduct, which included an “exchange of inappropriate photographs” with a vulnerable pupil while a PE teacher at Bilton High School, Warwickshire.</p>
      <p>He was cleared six years earlier of sexually assaulting the same girl during a trial at Warwickshire Crown Court.</p>
      <p>Hyde Peters, who did not respond to requests for comment on Friday, is understood to be adamant she and her husband abided by safeguarding rules at Coventry Godiva before relocating to Hampshire in 2017.</p>
      <p>But UK Sport, which is handing UKA almost £27 million in public and National Lottery money in the build-up to next year’s Olympics, was demanding answers.</p>
      <p>“Clearly, the accusations laid out are extremely serious and we are in urgent discussions with UK Athletics to seek all of the facts relating to this issue,” a spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>“All our investments into national governing bodies are contingent on a sport meeting standards set out by the Child Protection in Sport Unit and the Ann Craft Trust [in relation to Adults at Risk].</p>
      <p>“The integrity of the high-performance system is paramount, and so we will quickly but thoroughly establish the facts of this case before deciding on the appropriate response.”</p>
      <p>Chris Clark, UKA chairman, added: “I fully support Zara’s appointment as CEO and feel she will do an excellent job. There can be no compromise, however, on matters relating to welfare and safeguarding and it’s important we clarify the facts and processes undertaken as well as the decisions made in relation to the issues raised.”</p>
      <p>The allegations against Hyde Peters emerged via a recently retired detective chief inspector and former chair of Coventry Godiva, Martin Slevin, who on Friday provided this newspaper with evidence he had earlier sent to <i>The Times</i> that he claims shows her husband managed a team, that included minors, following his teaching ban.</p>
      <p>A safeguarding review of the club two years ago found no evidence rules had been breached on that front but, after being approached by <i>The Times,</i> UKA’s head of welfare, David Brown, said: “If what you’re saying is right, we have been misled. We were told he was team manager of a team with only senior athletes.”</p>
      <p>Slevin told <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> Hyde Peters was unfit to lead UKA.</p>
