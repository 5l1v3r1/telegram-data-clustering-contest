      <p>YouTuber Marina Joyce has made a return to her YouTube channel with her first video in five months, after she was previously reported missing.</p>
      <p>The vlogger returned to the video sharing website this week to upload a video of a clothing haul for her merchandise, as she can be seen showing off a series of different clothing items from her merchandise line in a park.</p>
      <p>Fans were overjoyed to see Marina back and active again on her channel, and later took to the comments to welcome her home.</p>
      <p>‘SHE’S BACK!!!’ one fan commented.</p>
      <p>‘Finally she posted something,’ another chimed in.</p>
      <p>‘Yay you’re back, I’m so happy to see you again,’ another added.</p>
      <p>‘OMG THANK GOD YOU ARE OK!!!!’ another fan wrote.</p>
      <p>It comes after the 22-year-old had <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/09/youtuber-marina-joyce-missing-nine-days-say-police-10548342/">previously been reported missing in August</a>, with the charity Missing People releasing an appeal for her to get in touch.</p>

      <p>The appeal was posted online on 9 August, claiming that she went missing from her home town of Haringey, London on 31 July, with the local police force for Haringey also urging members of the public to come forward with information on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Just one day later, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/10/youtuber-marina-joyce-found-safe-well-police-appeal-10550399/">she was found</a> and was said to be ‘safe and well’.</p>
      <p>‘We had appealed for help to locate Marina Joyce, 22, reported #missing from #Haringey – she has been located and is safe and well. Thanks for your RTs,’ the Haringey police force wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Her boyfriend, Brandon Mehmed, later told fans not to worry about Marina, revealing that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/11/missing-youtuber-marina-joyce-make-video-explaining-found-safe-well-10552224/">she would be making a video to explain what had happened.</a></p>
      <p>Prior to her disappearance, her last YouTube video to be uploaded was in June, as she showed her 2.1 million subscribers how she cared for her hair.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/marina-joyce-worries-fans-insists-never-actually-went-missing-10891291/">she has since worried fans by insisting that she never actually went missing.</a></p>
      <p>In October, the YouTube star returned to Twitter to share her side of the story, stating: ‘I never went missing in the first place.</p>
      <p>‘Also, Brandon has been so loyal throughout all this don’t trust anybody but him when somebody says something because he’s the one who knows everything and is my closest, and protects me more than any other person out there.’</p>
