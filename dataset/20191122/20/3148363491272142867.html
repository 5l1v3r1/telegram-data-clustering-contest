      <p>The first deadly attack occurred on Tuesday morning in the state capital’s colonia Cerro Prieto as state police assigned to the Comisión Estatal de Seguridad (CES) traveled in a marked vehicle. The officers were preparing to conduct an arrest of several street-level drug suppliers believed to belong to “Los Sureños” gang. Officers came under intense gunfire from passengers in several vehicles. They returned fire and repelled the attack, wounding at least one gunman and taking three into custody. One officer identified as Sinuhé Domínguez Maldonado was mortally wounded and died at a local hospital, according to the Chihuahua State Police Director Óscar <a href="http://laopcion.com.mx/noticia/253992">Aparicio Avendaño</a>.</p>
      <p>The second attack also occurred on Tuesday in Bocoyna located approximately 150 miles west of the state capital. The Bocoyna chief of police was traveling in an official vehicle when he came under intense rifle fire. Police repelled the attack, but Chief Alejandro Marcie González, 35, died at the scene, and a second officer sustained non-life threatening wounds, according to local <a href="https://www.eldiariodechihuahua.mx/estado/otro-ataque-a-policias-asesinan-a-comandante-en-san-juanito-20191119-1589190.html">reports</a>.</p>
