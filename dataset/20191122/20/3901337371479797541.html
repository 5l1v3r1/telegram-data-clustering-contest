      </p>
      <p>The 31-year-old has made just one appearance for the Glamour Boys since an awful leg break while playing against Free State Stars back in September 2018, and while did make his long-awaited comeback in April, he was handed another setback that is thought to be career-threatening.</p>
      <p>It certainly appears that the former Orlando Pirates man, who was handed a new contract at the end of last season, will still be out for some time having just had some screws removed after surgery, and it remains to be seen whether he will be able to feature at all again this season.</p>
      <p>A statement on the club’s website regarding ‘Tight’ and his situation read, “According to the medical report, with the exception of Joseph Molangoane, the rest of the squad is looking good. Molangoane successfully removed some of the screws from the surgery he underwent for his leg injury.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>With Molangoane turning 32 in March and his deal up at the end of June, there does seem to now be a chance that 2019/20 could well be his last campaign with the Amakhosi. </p>
