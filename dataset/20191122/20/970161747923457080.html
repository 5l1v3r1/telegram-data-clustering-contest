        <b>Caitlyn Jenner has quite literally thrown herself into her <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> stint as, after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/im-a-celebritys-nadine-coyle-in-tears-as-shes-comforted-by-caitlyn-jenner-over-skydiving-challenge-11168416/">skydiving into the jungle</a> and getting off to something of a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/caitlyn-jenners-girlfriend-sophia-hutchins-wants-call-im-celebrity-producers-gut-wrenching-breakdown-difficult-deal-11186724/">rocky start in the camp</a>, she’s now bonding with the other women through the medium of dance.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In scenes last night, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/im-a-celebrity-recap-caitlyn-jenner-learns-girls-aloud-dance-as-she-apologises-for-insulting-soap-stars-11196763/">Nadine Coyle showed Caitlyn how to dance</a> to the Girls Aloud number The Promise.</p>
      <p>She said later in the hut: ‘I taught the girls a little bit of The Promise routine, Jacqueline and Adele knew most of it already.</p>
      <p>‘Caitlyn just threw herself into it, we’ll teach her Sound of the Underground next.’</p>
      <p>As Caitlyn settles into the jungle after that emotional first night, many fans have been left wondering whether or not the Kardashian/Jenner clan are tuning in.</p>
      <h3>Are Kendall and Kylie Jenner watching I’m A Celebrity?</h3>

      <p>At the time of writing, none of the Kardashian clan have spoken publically about Caitlyn’s appearance on the show.</p>
      <p>The same goes for Caitlyn’s biological daughters Kendall and Kylie – so we don’t know whether they’re tuning in or not.</p>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebritycaitlyn-jenner-kardashians-11170629/">Caitlyn’s relationship with that side of her family</a> has seen some strain in the past.</p>
      <p>As seen on the family’s hit reality TV show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Caitlyn and members of the Kardashian clan went through a rough patch after Caitlyn released her memoir as it was perceived that Caitlyn was making digs at her ex-wife Kris and the Kardashian lifestyle.</p>
      <p>In the book, Caitlyn wrote ‘that anytime a Kardashian is on television, many in the public tend to think it is a publicity stunt to make money’.</p>

      <p>These days, Caitlyn’s relationship with her ex, Kylie, Kendall and step-children has largely improved.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>She’s still close with Kendall and Kylie, and Kim, Kris, and Kourtney have all hung out with her recently either at Christmas or her 70th birthday bash last month.</p>

      <p>However her relationship with Khloe still appears strained, as she was not seen at Caitlyn’s 70th.</p>
      <p>On the Lorraine Show, Ross King previously asked the reality star: ‘Will having a child affect anything between you and Caitlyn?’</p>
      <p>‘I don’t think it affects anything with Caitlyn. Things are just as they are,’ Khloe responded.</p>

      <p>There’s a good chance that at least one member of the Kardashian clan is keeping up with Caitlyn on I’m A Celebrity as a source has said that Kris is secretly <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/im-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-banned-spilling-kardashian-family-secrets-11184453/">worried that Caitlyn will spill some secrets</a> about the family.</p>
      <p>They told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10369188/kris-jenner-scared-caitlyn-spillfamily-secrets/">The Sun</a>: ‘Kris doesn’t care what Caitlyn says about her or their marriage – after all, she had her book and her TV show – but she’s scared and horrified about Caitlyn damaging Kim or Kylie’s brands by telling campmates about their off-screen private lives.’</p>

      <p>This isn’t the first time that someone connected to the Kardashians has been on a reality TV show on this side of the pond, as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/29/kim-kardashian-gemma-collins-friend-jonathan-cheban-10652710/">Kim’s friend Jonathan Cheban</a> was seen on Gemma Collins’ Diva Forever in August.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Khloe’s longtime friend Malika Haqq appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in 2017, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/01/04/celebrity-big-brothers-malika-haqq-comforted-khloe-kardashian-ex-boyfriend-shot-dead-7202590/">Khloe reaching out to fans</a> at the time for help with finding a way to watch the show from the US.</p>
      <p>She took to Twitter to say: ‘I am so happy for @ForeverMalika being on CBB but I hate that I can’t watch. I have to know what’s going on in there!! Is she ok? I’m trying to find links! Can anyone help me?’</p>
