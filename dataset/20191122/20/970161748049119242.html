      <p>A little girl was hailed for her bravery after she rose from her sickbed to testify against a pedophile later jailed for life.</p>
      <p>The unnamed youngster insisted on coming to court to share the abuse she suffered at the hands of Kristopher Tetreault, 36, despite running a 102F fever.</p>
      <p>Tetreault, of North Port in Florida, was convicted of two counts of sexual battery on Thursday, and handed two life sentences.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Ryan Felix said: ‘I am so proud of this child.</p>
      <p>‘On the morning of her testimony, she had a 102-degree fever, yet she was able to bravely testify against her abuser while he was seated in the courtroom.</p>

      <p>He molested his victim, whose relationship to him was not outlined, while they watched a movie together on May 1 this year.</p>
      <p>The girl told an adult, with her mother immediately calling police.</p>
      <p>During questioning, Tetreault admitted abusing the same girl on previous occasions.</p>
      <p>The youngster was less than 12 years-old throughout the period of time she was abused.</p>
      <p>DNA tests were performed which discovered the pervert’s skin cells inside his victim’s underwear.</p>
      <p>The little girl told police that Tetreault had told her that people would blame her if she told them what he was doing to her.</p>
      <p>Tetreault’s sentences will run consecutively, meaning he will die behind bars for his crimes.</p>
      <p>His Facebook profile is filled with troubling memes, including one which reads: ‘Good people sometimes make bad decisions.</p>
      <p>‘They mess up, and they let others down.</p>
      <p>‘But that doesn’t make them bad people. We all make mistakes.’</p>
      <p>Another shows a photo of a sniper aiming a rifle, and warns: ‘Never fuck with a man that can end you from a different zip code!’</p>
