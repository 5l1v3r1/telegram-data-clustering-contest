      <h1>Amazon pulls "racist" skin-lightening products</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:15:36+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:15</time> by <a rel="author">AP</a></address>
      <p>E-commerce giant Amazon.com has pulled more than a dozen skin-lightening products with dangerous mercury levels off its website after pushback from Minnesota health and environmental activists.</p>
      <p>The Seattle-based company's change came after the BeautyWell Project and the Sierra Club's state branch delivered a petition on Wednesday with more than 23,000 signatures to Amazon's fulfillment center in Shakopee, Minnesota.</p>
      <p>The two organizations also took out a full-page ad in a local newspaper that day demanding that Amazon stop selling toxic skin-lightening creams. The ad had three words in bold print—"Dangerous, racist, and illegal."</p>
      <p>An Amazon spokesperson told Minnesota Public Radio News in an email Thursday that such products are "no longer available."</p>
      <p>As of Thursday, all but one of the 15 products with high mercury levels appeared to be removed from Amazon's website.</p>
      <p>It's the latest incidents where Amazon removed products from its site that some found offensive. Earlier this year, Amazon pulled doormats bath mats that features <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-pulls-offensive-bath-mats-and-doormats-with-quran-verses-from-site-after-protests/">phrases from the Quran</a>. </p>
      <p>In June, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-face-detection-technology-shows-gender-racial-bias-researchers-say/">a study found</a> that face-recognition technology that Amazon was marketing for law enforcement purposes had a racial and gender bias.  </p>
