      <p>REUTERS: U.S. stock index futures rose on Friday as latest comments from China lifted hopes of a trade deal after conflicting headlines this week knocked Wall Street off record highs.</p>
      <p>Beijing said it wanted to work out an initial trade pact with Washington "on the basis of mutual respect and equality" after reports earlier in the week suggested that a truce could be delayed into 2020.</p>

      <p>Global shares have retreated from the 22-month highs scaled in recent weeks on hopes of a resolution to the trade war that has dented business sentiment, curtailed investment and hurt economic growth.</p>
      <p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index is on course to end the week with its first decline in seven, while the Nasdaq is eyeing its first weekly drop in eight. A largely better-than-expected corporate earnings season also contributed to the rally.</p>
      <p>Investors now await U.S. manufacturing and services sector data, as well as a consumer sentiment survey by the University of Michigan to gauge the fallout of the dispute on the domestic economy, which has so far proven fairly resilient.</p>
      <p>At 7:20 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 49 points, or 0.18per cent. S&amp;P 500 e-minis were up 5.25 points, or 0.17per cent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 24.25 points, or 0.29per cent.</p>
      <p>Among stocks trading premarket, Nordstrom Inc rose 8.5per cent after the retailer raised its 2019 forecast and reported third-quarter profit above expectations.</p>
      <p>Ross Stores Inc gained 2.1per cent as the off-price retailer beat quarterly profit and revenue estimates and issued an upbeat forecast.</p>
      <p>Gap Inc was up 1.7per cent after edging past lowered expectations for quarterly profit and reiterated its plan to separate Old Navy.</p>
      <p>However, shares of Tesla Inc fell 2.9per cent after the automaker unveiled its electric pickup truck with an angular body in gunmetal gray that resembled an armored vehicle.</p>
