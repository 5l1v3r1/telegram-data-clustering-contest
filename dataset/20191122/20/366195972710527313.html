      <p>Just in case your evening was missing out on a dose of nostalgia, Geko, Stefflon Don, Dappy, and Deno have teamed up with flash from the past on their new collaboration, "Link Up." The four artists take on a sample from <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/JaRule/profile">Ja Rule</a> and <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Ashanti/profile">Ashanti</a>'s hit record, "Always On Time" but flip it in a way that builds off of the original song's theme. The visual for the song arrived earlier today with the four artists showing "relationship goals" with their ride-or-dies before visuals cut to the artists behind bars as their significant others hold them down. The song takes on the R&amp;B-infused anthem and adds a dash of dancehall and afro-fusion to turn it into a radio-friendly banger.</p>
