      <p>We don't hate the idea of this car as a whole, but it's also not very representative of the brand and arrives at a bad time for premium compacts. You see, pricing hasn't been announced yet, but considering it's a direct rival for things like the Audi S3 or <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2020-mercedes-amg-cla-35-shooting-brake-revealed-in-eye-popping-yellow-134973.html">Mercedes-AMG CLA 35</a>, we don't expect it to slide under $45,000.</p>
      <p>So would you have this over a Long Range (dual motor) Tesla Model 3? Before your verdict is cast, know that the M235i Gran Coupe gets a 2-liter turbo engine with about 300 horsepower and 332 pound-feet of torque. And while the standard <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/a.html#ge-all-wheel-drive"><u>AWD</u></a> system is responsible for that amazing sprint time, this is basically like a neutral front-biased car, none of that playful stuff. BMW also chose to show that amazing M2 CS in Los Angeles, which feels like a polar opposite car, even though they belong to the same family now.</p>
      <p>The design package is clearly the best part of the <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2020-bmw-2-series-gran-coupe-enters-production-in-germany-138938.html">Gran Coupe</a>. While it doesn't feel as imposing as a 4-door 8 Series model, also called a Gran Coupe, this might be the best-looking compact on the market. Frameless doors and extra-long taillights are some of our favorite features here, plus the interior is swanky without looking try-hard (like Mercedes).</p>
      <p>Besides the M235i, BMW has plans to offer a base model called the 228i, with the same engine as the X1 crossover and retailing from around $35,000. Optionally, you will probably have the body kit, wheels, and suspension from the top-end model on the less powerful one. On top of this, adaptive dampers will be offered.</p>
      <p>Quietly making its debut inside the compact is new infotainment as well, the optional BMW Live Cockpit Pro with iDrive7 and two 10-inch displays. You can also have a head-up display, though we don't really see the point. üèÅ</p>
