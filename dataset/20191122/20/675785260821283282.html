      <h2>The Lib Dem leader laughed as a Question Time audience member told her the stance was 'ridiculous' - but she told host Fiona Bruce that stranger things have happened in a general election campaign</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:22:03+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:22</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Jo Swinson tonight suggested she might still become Prime Minister despite needing to gain more than 300 seats in a cringeworthy live TV clash.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dem leader was hit with a tough question on a BBC Question Time leaders' special over why she claimed she'd become PM.</p>
      <p>But despite an audience member saying her claim was "ridiculous", she claimed she had no regrets.</p>
      <p>And although she said things are now tougher she left the door open to the idea she could still join 10 Downing Street.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson was tackled about her claim at the start of the campaign that she could realistically become PM.</p>

      <p>“Do you regret how ridiculous that sounded?” an audience member asked.</p>
      <p>Smiling ruefully, she claimed: “I don’t regret it.”</p>
      <p>But she went on to say: "There is still three weeks left in this campaign.</p>
      <p>"And all I would say to anybody that thinks that you can predict the outcome of the election in the middle of the campaign.</p>
      <p>"Ask Theresa May how that worked out last time around!"</p>
      <p>The audience also tackled the Lib Dem leader over her bid to scrap <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> without another referendum.</p>

      <p>“You think we are stupid and don’t know what we voted for,” said one woman.</p>
      <p>Another railed against the party still claiming to be democratic, branding its name a “misnomer”.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson, who was a minister in the 2010-15 Tory/Lib Dem coalition, also left the door open to another coalition with the Conservatives, if Mr Johnson was removed as leader.</p>
      <p>And she was challenged on her record as a minister when the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> were in coalition with the Tories.</p>
      <p>Responding to an audience question, Ms Swinson said: "We also had plenty of fights with the Conservatives and we won some of those fights and we lost some of those fights and I am sorry that we did not win more of those fights in coalition."</p>

      <p>But the audience member said they were not happy with her answer - and it was too late to stop "harsh and uncaring benefit cuts".</p>
      <p>It came as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> faced a live primetime grilling from voters as the clock ticks down to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> .</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> leader were each due to be quizzed for 30 minutes by a BBC1 Question Time studio audience in Sheffield.</p>
      <p>Lib Dem chief Jo Swinson and the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> ’s Nicola Sturgeon were also confronted with voters’ questions, hosted by BBC presenter Fiona Bruce.</p>
      <p>The leaders drew lots to decide the appearance order.</p>
      <p>The format has proved tricky for No10 hopefuls in the past; in 2015 Ed Miliband stumbled off the stage after fielding questions for half an hour.</p>
      <p>And in 2017 <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/theresa-may">Theresa May</a> was wounded after shouting at a nurse: “There is no magic money tree!”</p>
      <p>The TV showdown comes after Labour launched its manifesto, and on the eve of the Conservatives’ unveiling their ballot box blueprint.</p>
