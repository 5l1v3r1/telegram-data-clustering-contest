      <p>Aston Villa midfielder <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/john-mcginn/"><b>John McGinn</b></a> took his international goal tally to seven in six games as Steve Clarke's side finished their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign with a comeback win at Hampden Park.</p>
      <p>Scotland failed to qualify through the traditional method but have another chance through the Nations League play-offs where they will play Israel in the semi-final next March.</p>
      <p>Buddies full-back McGinn, 29, preparing to face Ross County in the Ladbrokes Premiership on Saturday, revealed his younger brother watched the match again on television while he went to bed.</p>
      <p>He said: "My girlfriend works so I had my son and couldn't get to the game but he came and stayed after the game and he stayed up and watched the highlights, watching back his goals.</p>
      <p>"Once he was in I gave him the remote control and I went to bed and that was it, but he's on fire and I can't say I am too surprised.</p>
      <p>"I could see the excitement when he came through the door. I have been there, I have felt it the other way with a few Scotland results so it was nice that he was a bit more on cloud nine.</p>
      <p>"They look as if they have a shape now and it was good to have (Steven) Naismith back, he is a big player for us and fingers crossed he can do well in March."</p>
      <p>McGinn believes that pushing the former St Mirren and Hibernian player further forward was a "stroke of genius" by Clarke.</p>
      <p>"I am not surprised," he said. "I suppose I am a bit biased but I watched him at 18 at Hampden against Celtic and doing really well against all the bigger teams.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't really surprise me. Maybe the move further forward surprised me a wee bit.</p>
      <p>"But that was a stroke of genius. He is a clever player but because he is awkward looking and hustle and bustle, everyone thinks he maybe isn't quite like that.</p>
      <p>"But he is very clever so I am not surprised he gets on the end of so much."</p>
      <p>St Mirren are bottom of the table, two points behind St Johnstone, and McGinn warned of further danger ahead<br/>from the Staggies.</p>
      <p>He said: "Ross County are always a threat going forward. They are not a team that grinds out results, they do get boys forward. We know all about them. It will be a tough game."</p>
