        <b>The third season of the <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a29892270/what-does-the-royal-family-think-of-the-crown-netfix/">hit Netflix show </a><a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a29892270/what-does-the-royal-family-think-of-the-crown-netfix/"> The Crown </a>debuted last Sunday, and (spoiler alert!) one of the major plotlines of the season involves an illicit love quadrangle between Princess Anne, Prince Charles, Camilla Parker Bowles, and Andrew Parker Bowles.</b>
      </p>
      <p>But since The Crown is "based on a true story" and more than partly fictitious, some fans are trying to separate fact from fiction, and figure out whether Princess Anne really did date Andrew Parker Bowles before he was married to Camilla (who would later go on to marry Prince Charles). Confused yet?</p>
      <p>Well, it seems as if the general details of the affair are true: Princess Anne, who we always think is the grumpy one with the bunshe had an affair with Andrew Parker Bowles," said royal commentator Angela Mollard on a "Royals" podcast, according to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/true-story-behind-princess-anne-20887404">Mirror </a>. Prince Charles' biographer Sally Bedell Smith told <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/prince-charles-camilla-parker-bowles-anne-andrew-the-crown?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_brand=vf&amp;mbid=social_twitter">Vanity Fair </a>that Anne and Andrew first met at the 1970 Royal Ascot.</p>
      <p>Though the relationship didn't last, it seems they became lifelong friends, as Andrew is godfather to Anne's daughter, Zara Tindall (ne Phillips), with her first husband Mark Phillips.</p>
      <p>However, the timing of the affair IRL seems to differ from what went down on The Crown: Bedell Smith said that Andrew's dalliance with Anne did not overlap with Charles' (pre-Princess Diana) relationship with Camilla.</p>
      <p>Other royal experts suggest that Charles and Camilla got together in the first place because of the Anne-and-Andrew connection.</p>
      <p>However, Penny Junor, who wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charles-Victim-Villain-Penny-Junor/dp/0060193867?tag=elle_auto-append-20&amp;ascsubtag=[artid%7C10051.a.29830852[src%7C[ch%7C[lt%7C">Charles: Victim or Villain </a>and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0713VYF5J/?tag=elle_auto-append-20&amp;ascsubtag=[artid%7C10051.a.29830852[src%7C[ch%7C[lt%7C">The Duchess: Camilla Parker Bowles and the Love Affair That Rocked the Crown </a>, told <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a29830852/the-crown-charles-anne-camilla-andrew-relationship-true-story/">ELLE </a>that Lucia Santa Cruz, Prince Charles' friend from Cambridge and Camilla's neighbor, set them up around the time Andrew and Anne were an item, or just after.</p>
      <p>[Santa Cruz] and Camilla became very good friends because they were living one floor above one another, Junor said. She knew exactly what was going on with Andrew and felt sorry for Camilla, so [she] thought it would be nice to introduce her to Charles because she thought they would like one another.</p>
      <p>Dont forget this with the end of the 70s and Anne was a child of the 60s, so there was a quite a lot of bonking going on and not too many scruples about who with, Junor told <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a29830852/the-crown-charles-anne-camilla-andrew-relationship-true-story/">ELLE </a>, but Andrew was a Roman Catholic, and though it was unlikely that she would become the monarch there was still a slight thing about marrying a Roman Catholic.</p>
      <p>The Crown shows the Queen conspiring to force the Andrew/Camilla marriage (because she didn't want either of them dating Anne or Charles), but in real life, it seems Andrew and Camilla's parents were the ones who forced the union. Bruce Shand and Derek Parker Bowles reportedly published an engagement announcement in the Sunday Times on March 15, 1973, forcing Andrew to propose, according to Bedell Smith in <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/prince-charles-camilla-parker-bowles-anne-andrew-the-crown?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_brand=vf&amp;mbid=social_twitter">Vanity Fair </a>.</p>
      <p>So while there was absolutely a love quadrangle in the House of Windsor, the timeline is a little fuzzy.</p>
