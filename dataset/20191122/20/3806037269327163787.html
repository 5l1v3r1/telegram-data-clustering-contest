      <h2>Following better-than-expected third-quarter results.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/tesla">Tesla</a>‘s market cap has hit its all-time high since its gone public, and as of Wednesday, it settled at around $65 billion USD. This has put Tesla at a higher market cap than competitors <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/Fiat-Chrysler">Fiat-Chrysler</a> and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/Ford">Ford</a> combined. Although Tesla stock has yet to cross the all-time-high price of $385 USD per share, several market watchers call the feat impressive for <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/5/elon-musk-tesla-cash-problems-info">Tesla given its tumultuous year</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/tesla-third-quarter-results-2019-info">After Tesla outperformed Wall Street estimates for its Q3 2019 earnings</a> at $6.3 billion USD in revenue and earnings per share in $1.91 USD, the company began to see further success. Originally, analysts predicted Tesla to post a loss of $0.46 USD per share. The stock has barely slowed down since the results, and now the electric automaker has outpaced <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/General-Motors">General Motors</a> to become <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/10/25/3-things-to-know-as-tesla-tops-gm-to-lay-claim-as.html">America’s most valuable automaker</a> as well as the world’s third-most-valuable carmaker.</p>
      <p>Despite the success, several analysts are still skeptical of Tesla. Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch’s target price of Tesla stock is $385 USD, almost 10 percent more than where it’s trading right now, according to the <i><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/13/investing/tesla-stock/index.html">CNN Report</a></i>.</p>
