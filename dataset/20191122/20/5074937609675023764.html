      <h1>GNA initiates Partnership Communication</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:31:52+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:31</time> by <a rel="author">Laudia Sawer, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Tema, Nov. 22, GNA – The Tema Regional Office of the Ghana News Agency has initiated “Partnership Communication,” with the aim of building mutual understanding with State and Non-State Actors for national development. </p>
      <p>Mr Francis Ameyibor, GNA Tema Regional Manager explained that as a developing nation, the Ghanaian media must cultivate a strong two-way communication conduit with State and Non-State Actors taking into consideration the overall national interest as the measuring yardstick.</p>
      <p>The Tema Regional Manager said this in a meeting with strategic state actors and non-state actors in Tema to develop roadmap for the partnership, stressing that “Partnership Communication is not propaganda or public relations for the partners, as a media practitioner you must use non-confrontational language to report even the errors of the partners.</p>
      <p>“We must not use the power of the pen (media) to destroy lives or companies, but we must rather use it towards nation building,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Ameyibor said the GNA Tema Regional Office had already initiated and established Partnership Communication with the Tema Metropolitan Education Directorate of the Ghana Education Service (GES); and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and partners on the Girl’s Iron Folate Tablet Supplementation (GIFTS) programme to facilitate effective information dissemination at all levels. </p>
      <p>Others include; the Tema Office of the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE) for proactive advocacy on the National Referendum and the District Level and Unit Committee Elections.</p>
      <p>He said GNA Tema Regional Office also opened up with the Tema Directorate of the Nation Builders Corps(NaBCO)to offer support to the Government’s flagship project, with an objective of providing job and skills for unemployed graduates. </p>
      <p>Mr Ameyibor said “we are working towards establishing such partnerships with Traditional Authorities; Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies; Ghana Ports and Harbours Authorities; and TDC Development Company Limited”.</p>
      <p>He added that the office also initiated some partnership with non-state actors including; Services Merchandised Limited, Installation Specialists Limited and Twyford Ghana Limited among others. </p>
      <p>Mrs Bernice Ofori, Tema Metropolitan Education Director, during a meeting to cement the partnership expressed joy at the initiative saying it would help project educational activities in the Metropolis and beyond.</p>
      <p> Mrs Ofori noted that a lot of education related activities such as sanitation quizzes, sports, and cultural programmes among others occurred daily unnoticed due to the absence of media involvement.</p>
      <p>“We are happy that GNA has opened its doors for us,” she said.</p>
