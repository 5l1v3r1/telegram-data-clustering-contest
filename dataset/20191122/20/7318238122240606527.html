      <h1>This cafe lets homeless use its address to vote in snap UK election</h1>

      <p>A cafe in the UK is letting the homeless use its address to register to vote in the upcoming snap election in a bid to make the ballot more accessible to everyone.</p>
      <p><a href="https://arnolfini.org.uk/cafe-bar/">The Arnolfini cafe bar</a>, situated in Bristol, southwest England, has also printed out the necessary registration forms to participate on December 12 and says those without a permanent address can come in and use theirs.</p>
      <p>"We're up to a dozen or so people since earlier today," cafe boss Domhnaill Barnes told Euronews of how many uptakes he has had on the offer.</p>

      <p>Speaking about the registration process, he added: "It's quite long-winded for people without a fixed address... with this extra hurdle, and if you don't have a permanent address, you probably don't have access to a printer either."</p>
      <p>Barnes said he was inspired to carry out the idea after a conversation with his mother, who suggested that he could legally allow people to use his address.</p>
      <p>According to the UK's Electoral Commission, a person can register to vote using an address "where you spend a substantial part of your time during the day or night".</p>
      <p>"This could be a shelter or any place where you sleep or spend a large part of your day," the advisory note added.</p>
      <p>For Barnes, the initiative is about making sure a person's right to vote is accessible for all, especially for those who don't have a fixed home.</p>
      <p>He said: "Allowing these people to engage in the democratic process is a hugely important thing to do.</p>
      <p>"Often, they are the people at the margins of society, and we want to help them feel included."</p>
      <p>The reaction, he says, has been "overwhelmingly positive" and one of gratitude from those who have taken up the opportunity.</p>
      <p>It has also prompted other cafes and bars around the country to contact him to find out how they can also get involved.</p>
      <p>"It shocked us, and amazed us, and surprised us," Barnes said, adding: "The response we've had demonstrates the impact we can have."</p>
