      <p>When a story that was super successful in two languages as ‘Arjun Reddy’ and ‘Kabir Singh’, one wouldn’t expect anything new content-wise when the same story is made in a different language, the third time.</p>
      <p>We are talking about ‘Adithya Varma’, the maiden acting venture of Chiyaan Vikram’s son Dhruv Vikram. The movie is out in the theatres and most of the reviews on the film said that it was a faithful remake by director Gireesayya who was the first assistant director of Sandeep Reddy for ‘Arjun Reddy’.</p>
      <p>Dhruv also got pass marks, indeed good marks for his performance as a doctor who has acute anger management issues. Though we know that playing Arjun Reddy character in the Tamil remake means no escaping from Vijay Deverakonda’s shadow.</p>
      <p>At the end of the day, this second version ‘Adithya Varma’ of the Tamil remake must be a respite to the makers of the movie as they dumped the first version of the remake. Let’s wait and see how the box-office of the movie turns out to be.</p>
