      <h1>Cork hotel brilliantly hits back at guest who left bad review claiming to be in tears</h1>
      <h2>The guest complained about a dirty bathroom, a bad smell in their room and a bizarre burning incident</h2>

      <p>A Cork hotel brilliantly shut down a Tripadvisor review recently where the guest gave the place a "terrible" rating along with some crazy claims.</p>
      <p>The guest at the Ashley Hotel, Coburg Street, complained about a dirty bathroom, a bad smell in their room and a bizarre burning incident which they claimed was down to the placing of the kettle.</p>
      <p>However the manager of the well-known hotel bit back at the anonymous reviewer, refuting the claims as false while also acknowledging there may have been a mistake in regards the cleaning.</p>
      <p>The hotel manager said: "In regards to your feedback about the room - the housekeeping has not confirmed the room as signed off before hanging in the bedroom key and this was due to miscommunication between reception and housekeeping service.</p>
      <p>"However, the moment you rang the reception, the receptionist apologised about this misunderstanding and sent immediately the housekeeping to your bedroom to fix this issue. There was no smell identified in the bedroom or bathroom and no issue was found with the water temperature in the shower."</p>
      <p>The big issue however was the guest saying they were "left in tears" due to burning themselves with a kettle.</p>
      <p>The guest said: "The kettle and the coffee station was on a shelf beside the bed way too high up and when you went to reach it you had to be leaning over the bed, which would be a health and safety hazard.</p>

      <p>"Which actually resulted in me burning myself with boiling water. I reported it to reception and the girl from reception was extremely rude. It was only the two porters that were genuinely helpful and bringing up the ice to the room immediately after I requested it. The pain was that bad that I was actually in tears with pain."</p>
      <p>However the manager was quick to shut down this claim saying that the "couple of drinks" may have had something to do with the incident.</p>
      <p>The manager explained: "The report from your incident was presented by 4 members of staff who dealt with you during the night and morning.</p>
      <p>"At night, a duty manager with medical experience attended your room in the presence of a night porter with a first aid kit and offered to call a doctor, offered a gel for burnt skin â€“ Bepantiseptic, which you rejected and asked for ice only and insisted on it (which, for your information is not recommended on burns).</p>
      <p>"You were asked if you required medical attention to which you replied NO. You did not follow any advice from our night staff. If you were in such pain as you are describing now in your review, the staff would have made their own decision to call a doctor. However, at first you did not even intend to come out of the bathroom to talk to them. They followed your incident with a call from reception again that night to check on you and your boyfriend confirmed there was no medical assistance needed, you were fine and there was no blisters and you asked for more ice again.</p>
      <p>"Finally, in the morning, a receptionist on duty checked on you again during the breakfast time. Again, you responded that you were fine and no assistance was needed."</p>
      <p>Quite the exchange? Whose side would you be on in this instance?</p>
