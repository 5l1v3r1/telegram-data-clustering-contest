      <p><b>MOSCOW —</b> President Vladimir Putin said Russia would perfect an advanced weapon system following an explosion at a testing site that killed seven people.<br/><br/>At a Kremlin ceremony which saw Putin bestow state awards on the widows of the scientists killed in the accident, Putin also said their husbands did not die in vain.<br/><br/>"The very fact of possessing such unique technologies is the most important and reliable guarantee of peace on the planet," Putin said in comments broadcast on state television on Friday.<br/><br/>"And despite everything we will certainly perfect this weapon."<br/><br/>Seven people including five employees of Russia's state nuclear agency Rosatom were killed in an explosion at a missile test site in the far northern Arkhangelsk region in August.<br/><br/>A brief rise in local radiation levels sparked panic in northern Russia as well as fresh Western concerns over Russia's military nuclear power capabilities.<br/><br/>Western experts have linked the blast at the Nyonoksa test site to the 9M730 Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile first revealed by Putin in 2018 and which has the NATO codename 'Skyfall'.<br/><br/>The Russian authorities have, however, not confirmed that the accident was linked to the Burevestnik project and the identity of the missile that exploded remains uncertain.<br/><br/>Putin stressed that the weapon the Russian scientists had worked on had no foreign equivalent.<br/><br/>"We are talking about the most advanced technical ideas and solutions, about weapon which is without equal in the world," Putin said at the ceremony late Thursday.<br/><br/>"About the weapon which is designed to secure Russia's sovereignty and security for decades to come."<br/><br/>Handing the Order of Courage to the black-clad widows, Putin said Russia would always be proud of their husbands and support their families.<br/><br/>"They were in charge of very complicated, serious and critically important work," he added, calling them top-notch professionals.<br/><br/>"They had a special mission," he said.<br/><br/>"One day we will all pass. The question is, how did we live? Your loved ones lived an honorable life." — AFP</p>
