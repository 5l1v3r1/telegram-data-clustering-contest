      <p>The creators of the YouTube conspiracy channel Blake and Brett Cousins suspect that NASA and the International Space Station are running a mysterious experiment and testing “new space technology”. They suggested that NASA’s images, published on the agency’s website, could point to “some sort of secret sonic weapon”.</p>

      <p>The photos of the Atlantic Ocean off the Antarctic coast, taken from space, show “something ripping through the clouds that is creating a pattern that we haven’t seen before”, one of the conspiracy theorists explained.</p>
      <blockquote>“What kind of craft is zipping through the clouds to cut clouds and make this ripple effect? Whatever it is, it’s massive”, Brett said.</blockquote>
      <p>The fact that the ISS was at the precise location to take the good pictures of the phenomenon prompted him to conclude that this was an experiment.</p>
      <blockquote>“The ISS wanted to get some good images of this – they are super hi-res. Is this some sort of secret sonic weapon that we’re not aware of?” he asked, while his brother alleged it all could be “new space technology”.</blockquote>
      <p>Some commenters shared their suspicions. One even suggested that it could have something to do with weather control.</p>
      <blockquote>“Sonic blast, just like they use to control weather. U want proof, go to Mike Morales channel on YouTube”, a user with the handle Sherry King posted, while another commenter suggested: “It looks like a bow-shock from a craft breaking the sound barrier”.</blockquote>
      <p>Others were less inclined to believe there might be something sensational, saying it could be a plane going through the top of the clouds or good old Santa Claus making some early rounds.</p>
