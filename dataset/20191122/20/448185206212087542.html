      <p><b>Washington</b><b>:</b> US Congressman Pete Olson has praised India for revoking Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, saying the move will bring equality and peace to the region. Speaking in the US House of Representatives, Pete Olson said that Article 370 was a temporary provision, a stop-gap measure, that was forcing the people of Jammu and Kashmir to live under laws different from the rest of India. “The Indian Parliament decided to end it,” he said, adding that it was passed with a landslide majority in both Houses of the Indian Parliament on August 5. He said the revocation of Article 370 that gave special status to J&amp;K “brings equality to all Indians, and this action brings peace to Kashmir.”  (IANS)</p>
