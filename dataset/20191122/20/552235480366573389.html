      <p>A doctor who made a dishonest entry in the medical notes of a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/children">12-year-old boy</a> who died days earlier has been <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">suspended</a> for nine months.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/children">Ryan Morse</a> died at his home in Brynithel, South Wales, in December 2012 from undiagnosed Addison's disease, a rare condition, after a phone conversation between his concerned mother, Carol, and family GP Dr Joanne Rudling the day before.</p>
      <p>Dr Rudling did not make a contemporaneous note of the three-minute call in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/children">Ryan's</a> medical records on the late Friday afternoon of December 7.</p>
      <p>Instead she made an entry on the following Monday when she learned of his death and as police waited in the reception area at the Abernant Surgery to collect them.</p>

      <p>A disciplinary panel ruled Dr Rudling was "self-serving" as she failed to record she was told Ryan's genitalia were black and used a "less striking description" to avoid any criticism.</p>
      <p>The tribunal sitting in Manchester also found the doctor knowingly made an untrue statement to Gwent Police in November 2013 when she "exaggerated" in saying she had seen a summary of a fellow doctor's notes from an earlier call to the surgery by Mrs Morse on December 7.</p>
      <p>However tribunal chair Jayne Wheat said they determined that Dr Rudling was not "fundamentally dishonest".</p>
      <p>She said: "The Tribunal considered that Dr Rudling had had an unblemished career prior to these events.</p>
      <p>"It took into account that there had been no repetition of the dishonest behaviour in the seven years since these events.</p>
      <p>"Whilst the dishonesty which occurred was undoubtedly serious, when viewed on the spectrum of dishonest conduct the Tribunal concluded her conduct was not at the highest end.</p>

      <p>"The Tribunal considered that a period of suspension should allow Dr Rudling time to begin the process of reflection and remediation and to develop insight.</p>
      <p>"It considered she had demonstrated her capability to do so in the clinical areas of her practice."</p>
      <p>The General Medical Council (GMC) had argued Dr Rudling should be struck off as her actions constituted a serious breach of good medical practice.</p>
      <p>The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service panel also ruled that during the December 7 phone call Dr Rudling had failed to obtain an adequate history of Ryan's wellbeing and change in genitalia colour, failed to advise an urgent assessment was required and failed to offer and undertake a home visit.</p>
      <p>At the hearing Dr Rudling apologised to Mrs Morse and issued a "reflective statement" in which she said: "I know none of what I have done since 2012 will change what happened and hindsight is a wonderful thing, but I do want to make sure I have learnt from any errors of judgment I made so I can make sure nothing like this happens again.</p>
      <p>"I know my experiences have had a profound and life-long effect on me as a person and the way I practice. I want to take the negatives and try to turn them into positives and give this back to the community in which I work."</p>
      <p>Dr Rudling and Dr Lindsey Thomas, who also practised at the surgery, were charged with manslaughter by gross negligence following Ryan's death.</p>
      <p>During their trial, the prosecution accepted the doctors could not have been expected to diagnose Addison's, which affects around 10 in every 100,000 people.</p>
      <p>A High Court judge ruled there was no case to answer and Dr Rudling was also acquitted of perverting the course of justice.</p>
      <p>An inquest in September 2017 concluded that Ryan's death was "due to natural causes where the opportunity to administer lifesaving treatment was missed" because the youngster was not referred to hospital.</p>
      <p>Dr Rudling had denied acting dishonestly.</p>
