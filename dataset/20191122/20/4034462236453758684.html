      <h1>2021 Chevy Trailblazer Will Be Cheaper Than The Dirt On Its Tires</h1>
      <h2>Starting under $20k, the Bowtie's new crossover will be even more budget-friendly than the Trax.</h2>

      <p>Have you been scoping out the new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/trailblazer">Chevy Trailblazer</a> and wondered how much it'd cost to put one in your driveway? Well wonder no more, crossover customer, because Chevrolet has announced preliminary pricing for its latest little SUV, and in short, it's cheap.</p>
      <p>Just how cheap, you ask? Under $20,000, says the Bowtie brand. Which is pretty darn cheap, if still rather non-specific. Of course that's just the starting point, as there'll be plenty of trims and options to choose from, between the sporty-looking Trailblazer RS and the ruggedly styled Trailblazer Activ.</p>

      <p>Now before we go into any further detail, we should point out just how much Chevy has turned these SUV nameplates on their head. Though the old Blazer was smaller than the old Trailblazer, and both were body-on-frame trucks, as crossovers, the new Trailblazer is smaller than <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/blazer">the new Blazer</a>. Small enough to slot in between the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/trax">Trax</a> and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/equinox">Equinox</a> in the brand's growing crossover lineup that now encompasses five models, with the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/traverse">Traverse</a> (which replaced the old Trailblazer) at the top. But in an age when the Ford Mustang and Mitsubishi Eclipse can be turned into crossovers, we doubt the nomenclature or size classifications will matter for much longer.</p>

      <p>Drawing stylistically on the design set down by the Blazer, the Trailblazer seeks to appeal to a wide range of tastes. The RS trim (pictured in red) gets a mesh grille, black roof, and front splitter, while the more outdoorsy Activ model (pictured in army green) wears a contrasting white roof with rails, a larger, horizontally split grille, its own unique bumper, and its own suspension setup with off-road tires on 17-inch alloys.</p>
      <p>The choices don't stop there, though. Buyers will also be able to choose between turbocharged 1.2- and 1.3-liter engines to deliver as much as 155 horsepower.</p>

      <p>Full technical specifications have yet to be released, but both engines come mated to a CVT, with a nine-speed automatic available with the larger engine and all-wheel drive.</p>
      <p>There's a long list of standard and optional safety, driver-assistance, and infotainment systems on offer as well, and the options are sure to propel the price beyond the sub-$20k starting MSRP â€“ but there's room to grow before it reaches the Equinox's $23,800 starting price or the Blazer's $28,800. Further pricing for individual trims and powertrain configurations "will be announced closer to launch," with deliveries set to commence in the spring.</p>
