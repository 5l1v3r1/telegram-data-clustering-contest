      <p>TOKYO: Tesla Inc's highly anticipated unveiling of its futuristic pickup truck suffered a setback after its "armored glass" windows shattered during a demonstration.</p>
      <p>During the tightly choreographed unveiling of the Cybertruck to cheering fans on Thursday, Tesla boss Elon Musk had taken a stab at the design, power and durability of mainstream trucks, only to be shaken when his boast about his new truck's windows backfired.</p>

      <p>With a starting price of US$39,900, the Cybertruck's futuristic, angular body in gun-metal grapy resembles an armored vehicle and takes aim at the heart of Detroit automakers' profits.</p>
      <p>Musk singled out the Ford F-150, the top-selling vehicle in the United States, to highlight the capabilities of the Cybertruck, showing an edited video of the two trucks in a back-to-back "tug-of-war" in which the Cybertruck takes off, dragging the F-150 behind it shortly after both trucks accelerate from starting position.</p>
      <p>To show off the robust design of the new pickup, Musk enlisted his head of design, Franz von Holzhausen, to take a sledgehammer to the side of the vehicle, whose exterior will be made from the same stainless steel used in the Starship rocket developed by Musk's SpaceX aerospace company.</p>
      <p>The crowd cheered when it bounced off the surface without leaving a mark.</p>
      <p>But the truck's windows were not as fortunate, cracking like spiderwebs when von Holzhausen threw metal balls at them.</p>
      <p>The blunder overshadowed the launch, which was live-streamed from Los Angeles and made #cybertruck a trending word on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"Oh my ..., well, maybe that was a little too hard," Musk said, looking with surprise at the cracked driver's side window.</p>
      <p>Still, he allowed von Holzhausen another throw to the rear passenger window, only to see that crack as well.</p>
      <p>"It didn't go through, so that's a plus side" he said, adding: "Room for improvement".</p>
      <p>Reactions on Twitter varied including some advice on product launch and planning.</p>
      <p>"Never demonstrate something in a live audience, that you haven’t tried repeatedly backstage," wrote @DrBenH, while @JustinParayno wrote "I see it as a positive because @elonmusk's decision to test it live hopefully will cause @Tesla to be more cautious and make sure the sold Trucks will not crack."</p>
      <p>Others were more optimistic.</p>
      <p>"I personally don’t care that the glass shattered any other vehicle’s glass would have broken down completely," wrote @Kev112301, while @erikwray posted "There will be hiccups and they'll get worked out. The #Tesla cars are amazing and only get better over time."</p>
      <p>Tesla plans to start manufacturing the truck around late 2021.</p>
