      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/terminator-6/">Terminator: Dark Fate</a> director Tim Miller has admitted he has no interest in working with James Cameron again following <a href="https://www.cbr.com/why-terminator-dark-fate-failed-box-office/">the movie's box-office flop</a>.</p>
      <p>It's been widely reported that Miller and Cameron -- franchise creator and <i>Dark Fate</i> producer --butted heads creatively, over such things as narrative, character arcs and even lines being micromanaged. Miller has confirmed this was indeed the case and he doesn't want to be placed in such a similar situation again.</p>

It's more that I just don't want to be in a situation again where I don't have the control to do what I think is right."</p>

      <p>This isn't Miller's first disagreement over creative control on a property. He he also revealed he left <i>Deadpool</i>, as Ryan Reynolds wanted ultimate say on the property. As for his and Cameron's relationship, Miller admitted that while he doesn't want to work with him, they're still amicable. "I just got an email last week from Jim, who said, 'I know we clashed a little bit. I put it all down to two strong, creative people with differences of opinion and I think it made the movie better. I'll be back in L.A. in December. Let's go get a beer,'" affirmed Miller.</p>
