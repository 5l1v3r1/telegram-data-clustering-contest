      <p>Who can forget the infamous <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/12/10/jamie-lomas-calls-amir-khan-py-strawberrygate-finishes-second-im-celebrity-7148465/">Strawberry Gate situation</a> in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> back in 2017?</p>
      <p>In I’m A Celebrity last night <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway/">Kate Garraway</a> expressed her dismay that after winning Wagon Wheels during their Dingo Dollar challenge, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ian-wright/">Ian Wright</a> chose to take their winnings back to the main camp and give the treats to the celebs in jungle jail.</p>
      <p>But, how would Kate have felt had she been a campmate back in 2017, when the celebrities learnt that the two stars who had been sent to complete the Dingo Dollar challenge decided to eat the reward for their success – a basket of strawberries and cream – between the two of them, instead of returning to share the treat with everyone?</p>
      <p>The shock decision was an absolute scandal at the time and is still the only time in I’m A Celebrity history that two celebrities have decided to eat the Dingo Dollar treat reward themselves instead of taking the food back to the camp to share.</p>

      <h3>Who ate the strawberries in I’m A Celebrity?</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/11/30/strawberry-scoffers-iain-lee-and-amir-khan-win-immunity-from-first-im-a-celebrity-public-vote-7122775/">two celebrities involved in the Strawberry Gate</a> scandal were radio host Iain Lee and boxer <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/amir-khan/">Amir Khan</a>.</p>

      <p>Iain and Amir <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/12/10/jamie-lomas-calls-amir-khan-py-strawberrygate-finishes-second-im-celebrity-7148465/">decided to betray their camp-mates</a> and eat the strawberries and cream they were given by Kiosk Kev as a reward for completing a challenge and getting his quiz question correct.</p>
      <p>When the two stars returned to camp, they lied to their fellow camp-mates, which that year included <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tv-soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jennie-mcalpine/">Jennie McApline</a>, WAG <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rebekah-vardy/">Rebekah Vardy</a>, former footballer Dennis Wise and eventual <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/12/07/im-celebritys-georgia-toff-toffolo-lowest-paid-star-jungle-7139225/">winner Georgia ‘Toff’ Toffolo</a>, telling them that they got the answer wrong and so didn’t win the treat.</p>

      <p>After being plagued with guilt over his ‘crime’, Iain later came forward to confess to the camp what he had done, telling them he had eaten the strawberries, before Amir also followed suit and came clean. The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/11/30/iain-lee-cracks-as-im-a-celeb-campers-anger-over-amir-khans-sneaky-strawberry-secret-continues-7122960/">celebrities were, understandably, furious</a>.</p>
      <p>After returning home, Iain insisted that the idea to eat the strawberries without sharing them had been Amir’s originally and he felt incredibly guilty about it at the time.</p>
