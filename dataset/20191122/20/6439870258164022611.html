      <p>CONCORD, N.C. (WBTV) - As the Thanksgiving holiday travel begins this weekend, Concord -Padgett Regional Airport is expecting significantly more passengers this year compared to last year as Allegiant will have seven (7) more departures this year in 2019 than they had in 2018 over the same period.</p>
      <p>The busiest travel days are anticipated to be the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving and the Sunday and Monday after Thanksgiving. To ensure a smooth traveling experience, passengers should plan ahead, be prepared and arrive at the airport at least two hours prior to their flight.</p>

        <b>Parking Tips</b>
      </p>
      <p>Parking will be in high demand and overflow situation is expected. When the parking deck is full, signs will direct vehicles to the overflow lot location and shuttle service will be provided during flight operational times. Please allow an addition 30 to 40 minutes for parking and shuttle time.</p>
      <p>Parking rates are currently $9 per day for covered parking and $8 per day for uncovered parking.</p>
      <p>Parking can be paid for at the Self -Pay station inside the terminal for a quicker exit. The Self Pay station accepts cash and credit card payments. Remember to keep your ticket with you. A validated ticket will be returned. Drivers may then proceed to the exit and insert their validated ticket in the machine to exit the parking deck. Allow extra time to exit the parking deck as many people will be wanting to exit at the same time and there is only one exit lane on each level.</p>
      <p>Passengers can be picked up and dropped off along the terminal's curbside, however, vehicles cannot be left unattended. Curbside parking is not allowed and unattended vehicles will be towed.</p>
      <p>Concord-Padgett Regional Airport encourages travelers to arrange for transportation to and from the airport to help reduce parking congestion such as carpooling, being dropped off by a friend or relative, or taking a taxi, limo, or ride share.</p>
