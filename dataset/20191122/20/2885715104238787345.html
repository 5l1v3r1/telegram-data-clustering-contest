      <p>New Delhi is feeling rather concerned at the recent increase in efforts by Pakistan to gather military intelligence from India. During the last few weeks, India is believed to have asked Islamabad to withdraw as many as three of its officials working in the Pakistani embassy in New Delhi. The three officials — reportedly non-diplomats — are said to have indulged in gathering vital military secrets. Two of these officials — Gustaf Rana and Nur Khan — have already left the country. The third Pakistan embassy official, Anwar Ahmad, may also be on the way back home. Pakistan on its part has asked India to pull out two of its employees working in the Indian embassy in Islamabad.</p>
