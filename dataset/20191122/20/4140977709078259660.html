            <b>LA-XII Vs PE-XII Dream11 And Match Report: The junior batch of the Women’s Big bash League take on each other today in two successive encounters.</b>
          </p>
          <p>Whilst the ongoing edition of the Women’s Big Bash League has engrossed and exhilarated us in enthralling and intriguing fixtures, the focus shifts to the younger pile of players partaking in the league. Starting today, Lanning XII and Perry XII will be going at loggerheads in the Australian U19 Women’ Big Bash League to not only get some much needed time out on the field but also test their calibre infront of worthy players.</p>
          <p>Initially conceptualised to spur and spruce women’s cricket in the domestic fraternity of the country, the league makes an onset with not only giving the upbringing players from the grassroots level a platform to showcase their credentials but also a chance to identity players for the next stage. Separated into two outfits under the tutelage of Australia’s worldclass players Meg Lanning and Elyse Perry, this league promises to be an enterprising and engrossing one as players from Australia’s arena look to stamp their authority with enigmatic and quirky displays.</p>

                <p>Opening day of the league will see two matches being played inside the place of 8 hours as the two sides partake in a hectic and congested schedule. With the Women’s Big Bash League being played on the day as well and given the gruelling schedule of two matches in succession, both the sides will be looking to shuffle around with their squads with a slew of changes envisioned across the two match ups.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                <p>A traditionally tricky wicket to bat on, the fact that there hasn’t been some cricket contested here recently will mean that the side winning the toss will be looking to step out and bat first and pile on a healthy score. The wicket tends to wane and waver as the mach run down its course with the bowlers who take pace off the ball thriving and flourishing here. </p>

                            <h3>LA-XII Vs PE-XII Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Tess Flintoff from Lanning XII’s will be inducted into our Dream 11 side for this one. Although she’s been named in her side’s squad for the Women’s Big Bash League match on the same day, we envisage her playing this one and given her calibre and vibrant showings, she’s someone we had to move for.</p>
                            <h3>LA-XII Vs PE-XII Dream11 Batswomen</h3>
                            <p>With 228 runs in her previous 13 encounters, Phoebe Litchfield is the first name we are moving for in this docket of our Dream 11 side. The player from Perry XII has been in imperious form in the women’s Big Bash League, scoring runs constantly and persistently to see her become an instant choice for this encounter.</p>
                            <p>From the other side of the facet meanwhile we have opted for the duo of Georgia Hall and Caitlin Mari for this encounter. The two are players who have imbued in them an innate ability to come out and clean the ball, specialist and exceptional bats of the T20 format who’ll be looking to come out and mass a bagful of runs courtesy of their expansive strokeplay.</p>
                            <h3>LA-XII Vs PE-XII Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>We compensate for the batting picks from Perry XII in this facet of our Dream 11 side with us beginning with Hannah Darlington. Her stay in the T20 format has seen her come up with a stellar 493 runs along with the 28 wickets as well in the same time to make her someone capable of using her nous of traits as an all-rounder to emerge as an integral component of her side.</p>
                            <p>She will find company in the form of Ella Hayward whilst from the opposition we have decided to move in with the pick of Jade Allen owing to her escalated slots in both the segments of her side’s gameplan. </p>
                            <h3>LA-XII Vs PE-XII Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>Her wicket to wicket line and length have seen her become responsible for an exodus of wickets with the player inducing false shots in the opposition bats to send them packing with luscious ease. Her 12 wickets in 8 matches make Lanning XII’s Isabelle Arafas our first pick alongside Darcie Brown.</p>
                            <p>The opposition will have the two bat come in as will meanwhile with us deciding to divulge in the services of the myriad Stella Campbell who has smeared oppositions with her 16 wickets and Courtney Sippel.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Darlington will be made our side’s captain for the day whilst Litchfield is the vice-captain.</p>
