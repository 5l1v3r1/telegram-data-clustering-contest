      <p>The Perth side went into the most recent international break two points ahead of bottom team St Mirren following the 4-1 defeat at home to Hibernian.</p>
      <p>Wright welcomes Aberdeen to McDiarmid Park on Saturday, followed by a trip to Motherwell next weekend before a game at Rugby Park against Kilmarnock the following Wednesday night, as he hopes to get some momentum going.</p>
      <p>The Perth club's boss said: "We planned for the international break, we knew it was coming.</p>
      <p>"But where our season has been disjointed, we lost a game because of the League Cup semi-final and we will lose another game because of the final because we were meant to play Celtic that weekend.</p>
      <p>"It feels as though your season hasn't really got started.</p>
      <p>"The last three or four seasons, until the League Cup is out the way, we have had a bit more disruption to our season, because we have been playing teams involved in the semi-finals or final.</p>
      <p>"It is hard to believe we are coming towards the end of November and we have only played 12 league games but we have three games in 10 days â€“ and then we don't have a game.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully we can get a bit of momentum with it (three games). That will be the aim.</p>
      <p>"Every game in the league is tough. Even in our situation I believe we can take points off any team in the league so starting with Aberdeen on Sunday, we have to get a win and then go to Motherwell.</p>
      <p>"But players enjoy playing games and it will be nice to get three games in 10 days."</p>
      <p>Wright anticipates another tough game against Derek McInnes' side, with whom they drew 1-1 at Pittodrie earlier in the season.</p>
      <p>The Northern Irishman said: "We have had many battles with them down the years and we look forward to it.</p>
      <p>"Derek is getting most of his players back and Scott McKenna coming back gives them a lot of strength at the back.</p>
      <p>"They have quietly moved into third place in the league whereas a few weeks ago everyone was writing them off."</p>
