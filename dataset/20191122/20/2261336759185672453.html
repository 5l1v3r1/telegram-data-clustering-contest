      <p>Heavyweight boxing elite, Deontay Wilder, will put his WBC belt on the line when he rematches Luis Ortiz, this Saturday (November 23rd), at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. Bloody Elbow is here with the betting lines!</p>
      <p>The first time these big men slugged it out was back in March of 2018. Wilder was favored at around -300 with Ortiz owning an underdog line of about +229. Ortiz had Wilder on the ropes in the seventh act, nearly pulling off a wild upset. “The Bronze Bomber” hung tough, and went on to score a spectacular tenth round knockout to secure himself victory.</p>
      <p>This time around, Wilder is substantially more favored than before, clocking in with a moneyline of -650. As for Ortiz, his underdog mark has been inflated into +475 territory. The over/under for this WBC heavyweight contest has been set at 6.5 rounds. The ‘Over’ is slightly favored here, hovering in the -120 zone. The ‘Under’ prop is hanging on to a slight underdog value of +100.</p>
      <p>The oddsmakers are projecting Wilder to best Ortiz in less than 12 rounds once again. The exotic bet ‘Wilder wins inside distance’ is on the table at -295, with a +235 comeback on ‘Not Wilder inside distance.’ For those suspecting the challenger to pull off the upset, bettors can take the price on ‘Ortiz wins inside distance’ for a whopping value of +611. The proposition ‘Not Ortiz inside distance’ is on deck at a staggering favored line of -1076.</p>
      <p>For anyone expecting this clash of titans to endure the distance, both fighters winning by decision come with some rather large plus tags. ‘Wilder wins by decision’ is available with +619 odds, with ‘Any other result’ trending at -1095. The bookies believe that Ortiz taking the scorecards is a lot less likely option here. ‘Ortiz wins by decision’ is offered up at +1425, with ‘Any other result’ owning a gargantuan favored tick of -3225.</p>
