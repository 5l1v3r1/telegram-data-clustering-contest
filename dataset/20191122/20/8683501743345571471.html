      <p>Joker is nothing if not an agent of chaos, and that chaos has been on full display this week with the ongoing saga of a potential sequel to Warner Bros.’ smash hit <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2478973/joker-review"><i>Joker</i></a>. First we heard <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485205/joker-sequel-happening-joaquin-phoenix-likely-to-return">a sequel was happening</a>, and then we heard <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485264/wait-the-joker-todd-phillips-sequel-news-may-not-be-a-thing-after-all">it wasn’t</a>. In a situation like this, where one report is saying one thing and another is saying the opposite, if possible, it’s best to get the information straight from the source. Thankfully, <i>Joker</i> director Todd Phillips has revealed the ‘real truth’ about those sequel reports, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>Here’s the real truth about a sequel. While Joaquin and I have talked about it, and while touring the world with Warner Bros executives — going to Toronto, and Venice, and other places — of course, we’re sitting at dinner and they’re saying, ‘So, have you thought about…?’ But, talking about contracts, there’s not a contract for us to even write a sequel, we’ve never approached Joaquin to be in a sequel. Will that happen? Again, I just think the article was anticipatory at best.</blockquote>
      <p>It looks like it may be best to pump the brakes on the hype for <i>Joker 2</i>, at least for now. In his comments to Eric Kohn at <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/todd-phillips-disputes-joker-sequel-rumors-no-contract-1202191289/">IndieWire</a>, Todd Phillips addresses the various reports to reveal the truth of the situation regarding <i>Joker 2</i>. The director makes it clear that the initial report that <i>Joker 2</i> was moving forward, and that he was in talks to return as director, was at best premature because no such thing has happened yet.</p>
      <p>Todd Phillips is not signed on to direct a sequel, he and co-writer Scott Silver are not contracted to write a sequel, and Joaquin Phoenix has not been approached to reprise <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485318/why-jokers-joaquin-phoenix-resisted-signing-on-for-a-comic-book-role-for-a-long-time">his acclaimed starring role</a> as Arthur Fleck in a sequel. So by the sound of it, on a technical level (momentum is another story), we are no closer to a <i>Joker</i> sequel right now than we were right before the film came out.</p>
      <p>However, just because no names have been signed on dotted lines and no release dates have been set, that doesn’t mean that Todd Phillips is refuting the possibility of <i>Joker 2</i> ever happening. As the director said, when his film was on the festival circuit, prior to its October 4 release, he and Warner Bros. executives talked in an informal, conversational way about the possibilities.</p>
      <p>Todd Phillips has previously stated that he and Joaquin Phoenix <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483698/joaquin-phoenix-made-a-wonderfully-creative-argument-for-a-joker-sequel">discussed sequel ideas</a> during filming, but those informal hypothetical conversations are far from definitive. It is also noteworthy that Todd Phillips isn’t adamantly denying he’d ever do a sequel now, despite saying multiple times he intended <i>Joker</i> to only be <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480382/joker-director-todd-phillips-clarifies-sequel-comments">a standalone film</a>. He’s not saying he will do a sequel, but he’s not saying he won’t either.</p>
      <p>Obviously the reason <i>Joker 2</i> seems like not only a possibility, but an inevitability, is how well the film did at the box office. Todd Phillips’ film has made <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484942/joker-is-officially-crossing-the-1-billion-mark">over $1 billion</a>, without releasing in China is now the highest grossing R-rated film ever and the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484350/holy-cash-cow-batman-joker-is-now-the-most-profitable-comic-book-movie-of-all-time">most profitable comic book movie</a> ever. That’s a lot of incentive to dive back into Gotham for a sequel.</p>
      <p>Todd Phillips acknowledged this and admits that a sequel is obviously being talked about, at least by executives, if not with him just yet. But that’s as far as anything has progressed with regards to <i>Joker 2</i> up to this point. If I had to guess, we’re about $700 million past ‘if’ territory and well into ‘when’ territory when it comes to a <i>Joker 2</i>. Yet despite earlier reports, for now, that ‘when’ is not quite yet.</p>
      <p><i>Joker</i> is now playing. To see what movies you can look forward to next year, check out our <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480313/new-movie-releases-2020-movie-release-date-schedule?pv=search">2020 Release Schedule</a>.</p>
