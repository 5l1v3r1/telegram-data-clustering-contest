      <p>"The experience will give fans the opportunity to spend their matchday in the cosy, warm, classic feel of the pub mixed with the modernity of our Stadium for the live game."</p>
      <p>With a capacity of 80, fans need to purchase tickets to enter but the price will include seats to watch the game from just outside the pub.</p>
