      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare received a free content update for all players today.</li>
        <li>It includes new game modes, featured playlists, and Special Ops experiences.</li>
        <li>The Special Ops content supports cross-play and cross-progression.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://blog.activision.com/call-of-duty/2019-11/Incoming-Intel-The-second-Free-Community-Launch-is-Now-Available">Activision has announced</a> that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's latest content update is now free for all players across all platforms. Today's update includes new games modes, featured playlists, and Special Ops content. It may not seem like much, but that's only because it's building towards major in-game events that will drop in the future.</p>
      <p>Realism is coming to Domination, Headquarters, Kill Confirmed, Team Deathmatch, and Hardpoint. This removes the HUD and dramatically increases headshot damage along with lowering health. It is available across day and night map variants.</p>
      <p>Gun Game, the popular free-for-all mode, is now in Modern Warfare. Avery player starts out with the same handgun, and once they defeat an enemy with that weapon they earn a new one. Rinse and repeat until you've earned the final weapon (a Combat Knife or Throwing Knife) and kill an enemy.</p>
      <p>Operation Harbinger, Operation Brimstone, and Classic Special Ops: Door Kick round out the content this week. Each provides a unique scenario to take on, whether it be rigging a train for detonation or rescuing a local informant.</p>
      <p>This is only a prelude to the First Season of Modern Warfare content.</p>
