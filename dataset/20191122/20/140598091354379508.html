      <h1>Dog years are a myth and puppies are 'middle aged' by the time they are two, new study suggests</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:32:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-reporters/" target="_blank">Telegraph Reporters</a></address>
      <p>Dog years are a myth and puppies are actually middle-aged <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/news-features/pet-subjects-would-puppy-help-aging-dog-active/">by the time they are two, a new study suggests. </a></p>
      <p>One year for a dog is often said to be equivalent to around seven human years, but new research has suggested they are closer to a 50-year-old human by the age of three. </p>
      <p>A study at the University of California examined how dogs matured by focusing on a natural phenomenon called DNA methylation in more than 100 labradors, aged between 14 weeks and 16 years.</p>
      <p>The DNA contains marks which change over time as a cell matures, allowing scientists to track the biological age of a species. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/news-features/pet-subjects-do-stop-dogs-noxious-wind/">The findings were then compared to around 300 humans</a> - revealing that young dogs with boundless energy may be considerably older than they appear. </p>
      <p>By the age of two, the DNA of the labrador was roughly equivalent to a human entering their early forties, as opposed to a 14-year-old, which the traditional formula would suggest. </p>
      <p>Ageing slows in dogs over time, however, meaning that, by the age of 10, a labrador is similar to a person aged 68.</p>
      <p>The previous formula for calculating the age of the dog was apparently developed on the assumption that most canines lived until around 10, while humans lived until around 70.</p>
      <p>The US researchers developed a new method to work out the age of a dog - but unfortunately without the charming simplicity of its predecessor.</p>
      <p>Multiplying the natural logarithm of a dog's age in calendar years by 16 and adding 31 will show <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/truth-labradoodles-designer-dogs-no-madder-pure-breeds/">its equivalent age in human years, the study said.</a></p>
      <p>“The expected lifespan of labrador retrievers, 12 years, correctly translated to the worldwide lifetime expectancy of humans, 70 years,” the researchers said.</p>
      <p>There were also similarities in the ageing process between humans and dogs, the study said, with eight-week-old puppies resembling nine-month-old babies. </p>
      <p>The research, posted on the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">biorxiv.org</a> website, is yet to be peer-reviewed.</p>
