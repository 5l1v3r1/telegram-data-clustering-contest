      <p>You know the drill!</p>
      <p>It's Friday, which means Jane Fonda is protesting climate change in Washington, D.C. This week's "<a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/874447/ted-danson-jane-fonda-climate-change-protest-arrestee-week">Fire Drill Friday</a>" features appearances by actresses Diane Lane and Piper Perabo, as well as <i>The Good Place</i> actor Manny Jacinto and model Amber Valletta, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/diane-lane-piper-perabo-arrested-protesting-jane-fonda-1256880">per <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>. Lane, Perabo, and Valletta were arrested after they <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/jane-fonda-climate-protests-diane-lane-piper-perabo-1202793019/">reportedly blocked traffic</a> in front of the Supreme Court, but Fonda avoided being detained this week.</p>
      <p>The woman who started it all has been playing it cool in recent weeks, as another jail stay could be lengthy due to Fonda's first four arrests. Organizers fear she could face up to 90 days if she's arrested again, <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/jane-fonda-climate-protests-diane-lane-piper-perabo-1202793019/"><i>Deadline</i> reports</a>, which would render her unable to participate in the scene-stealing protests. Fonda previously spent one night in jail, which she said involved some <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jane-fonda-her-night-jail-it-was-just-me-cockroaches-1252833">one-on-one time with cockroaches</a>.</p>
      <p>The protests have drawn <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/875929/jane-fonda-gets-arrested-again-climate-protest-time-actors-rosanna-arquette-catherine-keener">numerous A-listers</a> thus far, and Fonda has teased that there are more big names to come. But any Hollywood stars looking to grab a slice of the climate change spotlight should book their flights to D.C. soon — Fonda has to be back in Los Angeles come January to film <i>Grace and Frankie</i>.</p>
