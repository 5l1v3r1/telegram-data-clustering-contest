      <h1>State of Decay 2 is coming to Steam next year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:37:17+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/anchalk/" target="_blank">Andy Chalk</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/state-of-decay-2/">State of Decay 2</a> was released in May 2018, and as a zombie survival game it was <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/state-of-decay-2-review/">quite good</a>, but as a Microsoft Store exclusive, well, I'll let you draw your own conclusions. That won't be an issue for too much longer, though, as it's now listed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/495420/State_of_Decay_2/">on Steam</a> and scheduled to go live early next year.</p>
      <p>The Steam page is light on details at the moment but indicates that cloud saves, achievements, and cross-platform multiplayer will all be supported. Developer Undead Labs confirmed in the announcement at <a href="https://www.stateofdecay.com/2019/11/22/state-of-decay-2-is-coming-to-steam/">stateofdecay.com</a> that the Steam version will support Xbox Live crossplay, meaning that the Steam, Windows Store, and Xbox One versions will all play together.</p>
      <p>Somewhat oddly, the Steam page lists the State of Decay 2 launch date as April 1, 2022, but that has to be either a mistake or a weird joke that's gone over my head, because the actual announcement sets it for early 2020. More information about the Steam release will be revealed in a livestream beginning at 3 pm PT/6 pm ET on November 25, on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/undeadlabs">Twitch</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP2NOm_MoASfovXVY4nGvgQ">YouTube</a>, and <a href="https://mixer.com/UndeadLabs?vod=BzhnkY-eZUe17382d4seeA">Mixer</a>.</p>
