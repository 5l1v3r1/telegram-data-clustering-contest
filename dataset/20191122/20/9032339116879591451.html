      <p>It looks like we can't have too much of <i>The Crown</i>. While the show's <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a14307181/the-crown-season-3-news-date-cast-spoilers/">third season</a> has just debuted on Netflix and its highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a27101318/the-crown-season-4-news-date-cast-spoilers/">fourth season</a> is mid-production, details about Season 5 already seem to be materializing. Here's what we know about the upcoming installment.</p>
      <h3>Season 5 is indeed expected to happen.</h3>
      <p>After <i>The Crown's</i> first season debuted, Netflix's head of content, Ted Sarandos, said that he intended for the show to last for six seasons. "The idea is to do this over six decades, in six seasons presumably, and make the whole show over eight to 10 years," he told <i><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/crown-will-run-six-seasons-netflix-boss-ted-sarandos-948671">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i> in November 2016.</p>
      <p>Sarandos's plan seemed to be further solidified in October 2019, when show creator Peter Morgan signed a massive overall deal with Netflix. Sources told <i><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/10/the-crown-peter-morgan-big-netflix-overall-deal-tv-film-1202752207/">Deadline</a></i> that the agreement would include two more seasons of <i>The Crown</i> following Season 4.</p>
      <p>Netflix, however, has yet to officially announce that Season 5 is happening.</p>
      <h3>Imelda Staunton is rumored to portray the queen.</h3>
      <p>Just as the cast was updated after the first two seasons, the show will likely do the same by the time it comes to Season 5. Multiple outlets are reporting that after Olivia Colman's tenure as Queen Elizabeth II, <i>Harry Potter</i> alum <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29894006/imelda-staunton-the-crown-queen-elizabeth/">Imelda Staunton may take over</a>. A source told <i><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/netflix-addresses-reports-imelda-staunton-cast-the-crown-1202792657/">Deadline</a></i> that Staunton is "in talks" to succeed Colman in the role for Seasons 5 and 6.</p>
      <p>A Netflix spokesperson denied the speculation, saying, "We are currently filming season 4 of <i>The Crown </i>but have not commissioned any further seasons as yet, therefore any news on casting remains pure speculation."</p>

      <h3>The release date remains unconfirmed.</h3>
      <p>The wait between Seasons 2 and 3 was longer than usual (about two years instead of one) because the entire cast had changed. Therefore, with Season 4 expected to arrive in 2020, it's possible Season 5 might not come until 2022. We'll have to wait for Netflix to confirm.</p>
