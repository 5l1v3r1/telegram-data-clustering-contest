      <p>J.J. Abrams only wants to do right by George Lucas.</p>
      <p>Walt Disney CEO <a href="https://etcanada.com/news/512348/disney-ceo-bob-iger-says-george-lucas-felt-betrayed-by-new-star-wars-plans/">Bob Iger admitted Lucas was unhappy with “The Force Awakens</a>” which was directed by Abrams. In fact, Lucas “felt betrayed.” Speaking to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/star-wars-jj-abrams-secrets-of-skywalker-912362/"><i>Rolling Stone</i></a>, Abrams was nothing but gracious in the face of Lucas’ criticisms.</p>
      <p>“I’ve only had gratitude for George. It’s probably a complicated thing for him,” Abrams said. “To decide you’re going to sell this thing that you created, that was your baby, to anyone — that must be more complicated than signing a check and smiling about it.”</p>

      <p>“He’s been incredibly gracious. He’s been super-generous,” the filmmaker continued. “He came over, we had a meeting when we first started working on this [new movie], talked through a ton of different ideas and stories, and heard from him what was important.”</p>
      <p>Abrams, 53, insists he has done his best to maintain the integrity of Lucas’ vision.</p>
      <p>“We’ve done nothing but try and adhere to some fundamental aspects of the story,” Abrams assured. “It wasn’t a difficult thing to try and do. And again, he was really gracious. So I’m only grateful. Do I wish that [‘Force Awakens’] had been his favourite movie of all time? Yes…”</p>

      <p>“I only wanted to do well by him,” he added. “I would just say that I have nothing but profound respect for the guy and am still truly, even more so now, working on these movies in awe of what he created.”</p>
      <p>In his book, Iger claimed that Lucas “didn’t hide his disappointment” about “The Force Awakens” and complained that “there’s nothing new.”</p>
      <p>Abrams also directs “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” which is in theatres Dec. 20.</p>
