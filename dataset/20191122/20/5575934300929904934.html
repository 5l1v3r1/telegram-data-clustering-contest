      <p>Angela Bassett says as we’re headed in to “eating season,” this November and December, it’s important to remember that what we put in our bodies is the fuel that keeps us alive.</p>
      <p>For the star, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDMf3kPpidQ&amp;amp;feature=emb_title">an ambassador</a> for the Know Diabetes by Heart initiative from the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association, heart health and healthy eating are personal. Bassett’s mother, Betty Jane, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL7AlnNA1-bIO_naQH1ndGuvQ8FPtMT-A2&amp;amp;v=vpAx-WoQvEE">died from type-2 diabetes-linked congestive heart</a> failure in 2014.</p>
      <p>“She championed me and believed in me and supported me my whole life,” Bassett said.</p>
      <p>Five years on, Bassett still speaks out about heart health, because the heart issues that killed her mother have “become an epidemic,” she said.</p>
      <p>One of her biggest tips for keeping your heart ticking is to treat your food as medicine.</p>
      <p>“I see it as medicine, but I also see it as fuel,” the “Black Panther” and “9-1-1” star told Insider. “I try not to see it as just pure enjoyment, or something I do because I’m bored or stressed, which, you know, I can do that too. I think I grew up with that.”</p>
      <p>It’s a tactic many doctors are keen on.</p>
      <p>“For centuries, diet was the only kind of medicine,” cancer researcher Siddhartha Mukherjee <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/ketogenic-diet-boosts-cancer-treatment-in-mice-2018-7">recently told Business Insider</a>.</p>
      <p>At home, Bassett said she tries to stay away from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/processed-food-makes-us-fat-leads-to-cancer-alternatives-2019-5">refined, processed foods</a>, like white flour. These are items we know are linked to shorter lives and more diseases, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/what-is-processed-food-2019-5">including cancer</a>.</p>
      <p>Instead, she focuses on incorporating “healthy fats” into her diet, and eating whole foods like fruits and spices, both <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/foods-that-fight-cancer-2019-2">anti-inflammatories</a> that can help keep disease and illness at bay.</p>
      <p>One of her favourite dishes, she said, is a Moroccan chicken with olives, and she does not always skip dessert, either.</p>

      <p>“I make a mean brownie, a chocolate brownie, and it’s made from cacao and sweet potatoes,” Bassett said. “No one knows the difference, but my body does.”</p>
      <p>If she’s going to eat red meat, Bassett prefers bison, which are not bred or fed hormones and antibiotics in the same way as conventional beef. Bison also contain<a href="https://www.berkeleywellness.com/healthy-eating/food/article/bison-meat-better-beef"> more heart healthy omega-3s</a> (though they’re still not nearly as omega-rich as fatty fish like salmon.)</p>
      <p>This Thanksgiving, her biggest post-meal recommendation is to encourage your family and friends to move a little, no matter what you eat.</p>
      <p>“Let’s get up and go for a walk,” she said.</p>
      <p>Research indicates even <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-disease-prevention/art-20046502">a 30-minute walk each day</a> can help maintain heart health.</p>
      <p>If your people don’t like to walk, she said there are other ways to “sneak” a little physical activity, like a “dance competition.”</p>
      <p>Studies show this kind of short, intense exercise has heart benefits too. Even three short, quick bursts of 20-second all-out physical effort can <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/high-intensity-interval-training-for-beginners-2018-4">improve overall fitness</a>.</p>
      <p>Often, all it takes is a suggestion to get people moving.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes you just have to say it,” Bassett said. “You gotta take control.”</p>
