      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jo-swinson/">Jo Swinson</a> has faced a grilling on her voting record under the coalition government – when she voted for the controversial bedroom tax and against raising benefits.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dem leader was asked how her party could be ‘trusted’ to help people living in poverty given the role it played in austerity under the coalition government formed in 2010.</p>
      <p>Taking to the stage<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/jeremy-corbyn-reveals-hell-remain-neutral-second-brexit-referendum-11204179/"> during a BBC Question Time leaders special</a>, her own personal voting history was criticised by audience members, who asked her why she supported <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/universal-credit/">Universal Credit</a>.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson accepted her party ‘didn’t get everything right’ in the past and categorically ruled out a future coalition government with the Conservatives under <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson.</a></p>
      <p>‘I get it, we got stuff wrong, but in the future, we’ll do better’ she said.</p>

      <p>However her reassurances didn’t satisfy the audience member, who pressed her to pledge scrapping Universal Credit like Labour have.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The Lib Dem leader said she wouldn’t scrap the controversial six-in-one benefit  because the issue is ‘the amount of money in it’, not the principle of benefit reform per se.</p>
      <p>She was scrutinised on her role in worsening austerity after a brutal first question which asked if she regretted saying she could become Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>Swinson admitted that things had got harder for her since the Brexit party stood down in Tory seats.</p>
      <p>She also claimed that stranger things  have happened in elections – such as Donald Trump’s victory in 2016.</p>

      <p>However she also implied that she now accepts that she won’t be PM after polling day.</p>
      <p>Attention then turned to her policy on Brexit.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘You might agree with us, you might disagree with us, but you can’t accuse us of not having a clear position on Brexit’.</p>
      <p>However, that failed to win over the audience who appeared largely unimpressed with her performance.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson, who has vowed to revoke Article 50 on ‘day one’ if she becomes Prime Minister, was criticised by pro-remain and vote leave audience members alike.</p>

      <p>One remainer said she is turned off by the Lib Dems because they seem more interested in arguing with other parties than getting stuff done.</p>

      <p>The Lib Dem leader was also criticised by one man for branding Jeremy Corbyn an anti-Semite.</p>
      <p>He definitely old her ‘Jeremy Corbyn has been fighting racism since before you were born’.</p>
      <p>Another enraged audience member accused Ms Swinson of criticising Labour then making up policies on the back of what Jeremy Corbyn’s party have pledged.</p>

      <p>The audience member said: ‘<i>Y</i>ou pretend to be progressive. But you have voted against progressive policiesThe Lib Dems are a right wing party and they do not get my vote’</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson replied to say she is not a ‘social democrat’ but  a liberal.</p>
      <p>‘The Lib Dems are a liberal party. We are internationalist’ she said.</p>
