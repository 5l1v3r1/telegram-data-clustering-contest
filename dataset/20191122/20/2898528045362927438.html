      <h1>Jared Gordon suffers broken orbital bone in UFC Sao Paulo loss to Charles Oliveira, needs surgery (updated)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T20:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Guilherme Cruz, https://facebook.com/guicruzmma/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4060/jared-gordon">Jared Gordon</a> might have to go under the knife after losing via first-round knockout to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/175/charles-oliveira">Charles Oliveira</a> at UFC Sao Paulo on Nov. 16.</p>
      <p>“Flash” Gordon announced on his social media Friday that exams showed a fracture on his left orbital bone following his recent 155-pound bout in Brazil. The 31-year-old fighter has experienced the same injury in the past.</p>
      <p>“Turns out I broke my left orbital last Saturday,” Gordon wrote on Instagram. “I had an orbital repair in 2015 as shown in the pictures [in the post]. This wasn’t nearly as painful as 2015 but the fracture is touching the nerve and I can’t feel the left side of my face. Surgery is possible if the muscle is entrapped. Further testing will tell if I need urgent surgery or not.</p>
      <p>“All I want to do is get back in there. I’ll never quit. My life is far from a smooth ride to where I want to go. I try and usually fail until I accomplish anything. Why would this be different? Life on life’s terms.”</p>
      <p>Gordon was coming off a decision victory over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4405/dan-moret">Dan Moret</a> when he took the fight against Oliveira in Sao Paulo. The Roufusport talent has now dropped three of his last four in the Octagon.</p>
