      <h1>World's biggest hedge fund denies it has bet $1.5b on markets falling</h1>

      <p>Bridgewater Associates' Ray Dalio said on Friday his hedge fund does not have a net bet that the stock market will fall, taking issue with a story published earlier in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>.</p>
      <p>The hedge fund has bet more than $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) that stock markets around the world will drop by March, the WSJ said in its report on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>

      <p>Wall Street is currently at record highs but many analysts are sceptical of whether the levels can be sustained, with the US-China trade saga and fears of a recession in 2020 among the issues keeping investors on edge.</p>
      <p>The bet, assembled over a span of months and executed by a handful of Wall Street firms, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, would pay off for the world's biggest hedge fund if either the S&amp;P 500 or the Euro Stoxx 50 — or both — declines, the report had said.</p>
      <p>The bet is made up of put options, contracts that give investors the right to sell stocks at a specific price by a certain date. The options expire in March and currently represent one of the largest bearish bets against the market, the report added.</p>
      <p>"To convey us having a bearish view of the stock market would be misleading," Dalio said in a statement.</p>
      <p>However, Dow Jones, the publisher of <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, said the article is based on interviews with multiple sources.</p>
      <p>"The article does not report, as Mr. Dalio says, that Bridgewater has a 'net' bearish position on the stock market," a spokesman for Dow Jones said.</p>
      <p>"The article made clear that the trade could be a hedge for the firm's significant long exposure to equity markets, among other possibilities."</p>
