      <p>The third single ‘OMG Daddy’ from ‘<a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/movienews/official-clarity-on-sarileru-neekevvaru-and-ala-vaikunthapurramloo-clash/">Ala Vaikuntapuramlo</a>‘ came out, and it’s not as catchy as the previous two songs that came out creating a sensation, immediately.</p>
      <p>Unless there are visuals that may bring some funny vibes it’s a bit disappointment from ‘Ala Vaikuntapuramlo’, in fact, its the first disappointment after SS Thaman delivered two catchy and well-written songs aka ‘Samajavaragamana’ and ‘Ramulo Ramula’.</p>
      <p>Coming to the song, it’s definitely different from the other two songs. After a class and a mass treat, this third song is a hip hop song by Bigg Boss star Roll Rida. It might look very impressive with the visuals. Anyway, the movie has got enough buzz because of the previous two songs.</p>
      <p>Allu Arjun will be coming with this classy mass treat for the upcoming Sankranthi in January 2020. Though this song was a bit disappointing, the other two songs have already made it up for the rest of the album, haven’t they?</p>
