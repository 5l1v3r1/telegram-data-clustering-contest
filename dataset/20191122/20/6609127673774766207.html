        <b>COPS were called out after a male stripper’s manhood popped out — at a raunchy event an Isle of Bute pub had dubbed its “Sausage Party”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A shocked punter landed the boozer in trouble by making a formal complaint about the fleeting flash of todger.</p>

      <p>But last night bosses at the Scottish Honky Tonk in Ardbeg on the Firth of Clyde island blamed the incident on a costume cock-up.</p>
      <p>Brody Jamieson, 50, and wife Rima, 43, also insisted they had ordered the performers not to strip off completely like Robert Carlyle in the 1997 film The Full Monty.</p>

        <figcaption>Punters at the Scottish Honky Tonk's sausage party got a bit more than they bargained for</figcaption>

      <p>It came after they faced Argyll and Bute Council to explain what went wrong at their “Scottish Honky Tonk Sausage Party” in February.</p>
      <p>Their representative, Peter Austin, told licensing chiefs: “The dancers were told they were not to go the Full Monty. But these instructions were gone against.</p>
      <p>“One dancer covered his modesty with a flag — which was removed.</p>
      <p>“It was only visible to a few people, not the entire crowd.”</p>

      <p>Chief Superintendent John Paterson told how cops launched a probe as the venue had no adult entertainment licence.</p>
      <p>He said: “The fiscal has sent a warning letter.”</p>
      <p>The council’s licensing committee chair David Kinniburgh agreed the incident was a one-off, adding: “I think the lesson has been learned.”</p>
      <p>Last night Mr Jamieson, who has pledged not to host any more strip nights, insisted: “It really was just a wardrobe malfunction.”</p>
