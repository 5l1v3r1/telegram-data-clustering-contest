      <h1>Albert Adomah - Why next five weeks are so vital to Nottingham Forest's promotion bid</h1>
      <h2>The Reds return to Championship action at Bristol City on Saturday looking for their fifth away win of the season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:41:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:41</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>The next month could prove to be a crucial period in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>’s season, a campaign they hope will end in promotion to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>That’s the verdict of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forests-predicted-team-face-3565257">Albert Adomah</a>, who believes the busy period leading up to Christmas may will be a significant one in the context of the league season.</p>
      <p>Now the final international break of the calendar year is out of the way, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-injuries-bristol-city-3413847">the Reds</a> start their hectic run of 10 games in the space of five weeks at one of his former clubs, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/worries-lot-how-bristol-city-3566046">Bristol City</a> on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Like Forest, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-nottingham-forest-grabban-3564739">the Robins have designs of their own</a> on seeking a top flight berth, with both clubs locked together on 28 points inside the top six and only separated by goal difference, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-nottingham-forest-crowd-3564208">the Ashton Gate meeting is a set to be a pulsating encounter</a>.</p>
      <p>“As players, you know November and December is when there are lots of games,” Adomah said.</p>
      <p>“I think there is 10 games in less than five weeks and you look forward to the challenge as you want to play lots of games.”</p>
      <p>Bristol City are first up followed by a trip to QPR on Wednesday night, before Cardiff visit <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-forest-injury-news-3562952">the City Ground</a> next Saturday.</p>
      <p>A Friday night jaunt to Millwall is in the diary on December 6 and then Reds fans can look forward to a home double header against Middlesbrough and Sheffield Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Trips to Huddersfield and Hull either side of Christmas are followed by a home clash with Wigan to round off 2019 before Blackburn arrive on Trentside to see in the New Year.</p>

      <p>“This is when you can make a big difference; if you get more points in these months then you will be up there,” said <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/albert-adomah">the experienced winger</a>.</p>
      <p>“For us, we are in the top five now so we just want to maintain that and get as many points as we can.</p>
      <p>“We are in a good position at the moment but we are not taking anything for granted.</p>
      <p>“We will take each game as it comes and the more points that we can get, the better and hopefully we can stay up there too.”</p>
