      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:05:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:05</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>US President <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump </a>said Friday he had saved Hong Kong from being destroyed by persuading Chinese President Xi Jinping to hold off on sending in troops to crush its pro-democracy movement.</p>
      <p>"If it weren't for me, Hong Kong would have been obliterated in 14 minutes," Trump said in a scattershot early morning interview with Fox News.</p>
      <p>Trump's comments come as he mulls signing congressionally-approved legislation in support of the pro-democracy activists -- or bow to Beijing's threats of retaliation if the laws pass.</p>
      <p>Asked whether he would veto the legislation, green-lit by an overwhelming margin in Congress on Wednesday, Trump equivocated.</p>
      <p>"I'll tell you we have to stand with Hong Kong but I'm also standing with President Xi. He is a friend of mine he is an incredible guy," Trump said.</p>
      <p>"I would like to see them work it out. We have to see them work it out," he added.</p>
      <p>Trump cast his relationship with Xi as the bulwark keeping China from moving against the pro-democracy movement that has rocked Hong Kong during almost six months of increasingly violent protests.</p>
      <p>He added that a "million soldiers standing outside of Hong Kong are not going only because I asked him: 'Please don't do that. You will be making a big mistake. It will have a tremendous negative impact on the trade deal.'"<br/><br/>Trump acknowledged that the tension over the former British colony -- handed back to China in 1997 -- has complicated efforts to strike a trade deal with Beijing, a source of economic uncertainty as Washington heads into an election year.</p>
      <p>US and Chinese trade negotiators are "potentially very close" to a deal, he said.</p>
