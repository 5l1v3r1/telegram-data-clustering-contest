      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The new version of Facebook Messenger for Windows 10 is rolling out to select users.</li>
        <li>The app is completely rewritten and is at feature parity with the iOS and Android versions of Facebook Messenger.</li>
        <li>You may need to take some steps in your Program Files folder to use the new version of the app.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A new version of the Facebook Messenger app is rolling out to select users according to <a href="http://www.aggiornamentilumia.it/2019/11/22/facebook-messenger-desktop-anteprima-della-nuova-beta-in-arrivo-per-windows-10/">Aggiornamenti Lumia</a>. The new Facebook Messenger app is completely rewritten using Electron and brings the Windows 10 app to feature parity with the Android and iOS versions of Facebook Messenger. The beta rollout seems to only be available for select users, so you may have to take some extra steps to try it out right now.</p>
      <p>Aggiornamenti Lumia previously reported about the new Facebook Messenger application. The app can permanently delete sent messages, has dark and grey themes, and can send files. It also has the ability to hide chats, has a new icon, and has updated emoticons. Aggiornamenti Lumia also shared a video of the app in action.</p>

      <p>The beta version of Facebook Messenger is limited to select people right now, but Aggiornamenti Lumia has a <a href="http://www.aggiornamentilumia.it/2019/11/22/facebook-messenger-desktop-anteprima-della-nuova-beta-in-arrivo-per-windows-10/">guide</a> on how to force Facebook Messenger to use the new version of the app. It requires you to download a link off of Mega and to utilize some folders that require high levels of permission, so we advise that you know what you're doing if you plan to try it out.</p>
