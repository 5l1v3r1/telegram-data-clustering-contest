      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> refused to stop ranting and raving during a 53-minute interview with Fox &amp; Friends where demanded his own impeachment trial.</p>
      <p>Trump repeatedly interrupted the morning show hosts Ainsley Earhardt, Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade – whose frustration was visible – after the president called in to discuss this week’s impeachment hearings.</p>
      <p>‘Frankly, I want a trial. You know, I think I could have it – to be – whatever I want,’ the president said.</p>
      <p>Kilmeade, who seems taken aback by the comment asks, ‘You want a trial?’</p>
      <p>Trump fires back: ‘Oh I would – look, number one, they should never ever impeach.’</p>

      <p>The president is referring to a Senate Impeachment trial, which is the next step if the House of Representatives votes to impeach Trump. A vote of impeachment does not remove the president from office, but a two-thirds vote from the Senate does.</p>

      <p>Democrats currently control the House of Representatives so they could vote to impeach Trump without any Republican support, which is what many expect to happen.</p>
      <p>However, the Republicans control the Senate and can choose not to hold a trial, even if the House impeaches Trump, making it unlikely that Trump will be removed from office.</p>
      <p>Trump proceeded to attack his political rivals, especially his female rivals, during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNqKhRcpktU&amp;t=2616s">rambling interview</a> with Fox, which Trump has said is one of his favorite news and TV programs.</p>
      <p>He called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ‘paralyzed’ and ‘crazy as a bed bug,’ then seemed to stop himself just before he insulted former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who testified at the impeachment hearings on November 15.</p>

      <p>‘The ambassador, the woman, she wouldn’t even put up my picture in the embassy. She’s an Obama person. She’s a woman. We have to be nice,’ the president said.</p>
      <p>Throughout the first half of the interview, Trump also attacked Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who Trump accused of being involved in corrupt business dealings in Ukraine and China.</p>
      <p>He then focused on Chair of Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, who Trump repeatedly called ‘shifty’ and ‘a nut job,’ before saying: ‘and one more thing, before I get off (the phone call).’</p>
      <p>‘Oh we’re not getting off,’ Kilmeade said, as he and his co-hosts grinned.</p>
      <p>‘Oh yeah, I know, we can keep this going all day, it’s easy,’ Trump said.</p>
      <p>And he did keep it going – for more than half an hour filled with insults, conspiracies, and vague proclamations.</p>
