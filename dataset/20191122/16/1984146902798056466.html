      <h1>Lee Clark reveals what he feels was Newcastle's 'watershed moment' this season</h1>
      <h2>The Magpies have enjoyed an upturn in form in recent weeks and are closer to the European places than the relegation zone</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sean McCormick</a></address>
      <p>Lee Clark believes Newcastle's embarrassing 5-0 defeat to Leicester in September was a 'watershed moment' in their season.</p>
      <p>Since then, Newcastle have won three of their last five games, have lost only once, and have lifted themselves seven points clear of the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>The Magpies head into the clash just two points adrift of fifth place and after a turbulent start to his Newcastle tenure, things are looking up for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-aboutsteve-bruce">Steve Bruce.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> came from behind to beat Bournemouth last time out and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/lee-clark">Clark</a> believes that showed that they have the character to continue their positive momentum - starting with Monday's trip to Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>"I think Newcastle’s watershed moment for me was the Leicester performance and result," the former Magpies midfielder told <a href="https://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/lee-clark-mourinho-right-for-spurs-gomez-vs-sterling-not-uncommon-newcastle-watershed-4305259?utm_source%3Dnewsnow%26utm_medium%3Drss-feed%26utm_campaign%3DFeed-Latest%2BArticles#popup-sso">Tribal Football.</a></p>
      <p>"When that happened I think Steve must have sat down with his staff and players and have had individual and team meetings to get to the bottom of why things weren’t particularly starting so well.</p>
      <p>"And I think from the performances that I’ve seen since Leicester that seems like a bit of a watershed moment in terms of what they are trying to do.</p>
      <p>"I hope they can continue the momentum they’ve got and I’ve got faith that they can because of what was shown in the last game against Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>"The visitors started brilliantly in the first 20 minutes and scored a perfect goal off the training ground. But instead of shrinking, Newcastle showed the character that they have now. They withstood the pressure from a real good footballing side and eventually came back into the game, grabbing an equaliser and then the win.</p>
      <p>"It showed to me that they’ve got the character to not only respond to a setback, but come back from that setback and win games, which is what they’ll need to do this season."</p>
