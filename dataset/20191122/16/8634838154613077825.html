        <b>Bomet County Woman Representative Joyce Korir on November 22, called upon President Uhuru Kenyatta to offer a solution to her constituents and to the Mau Forest evictees as well.</b>
      </p>
      <p>She was hosting other women leaders from Jubilee Party, who identify themselves as Inua Mama, at the Bomet Green Stadium for an empowerment rally.</p>
      <p>Nicknamed the iron lady, Korir stated that Kenyans were suffering and in dire need of an intervention from the head of state.</p>

      <p>"Our women are crying, our children are crying, our women are perishing, Your Excellency, we are crying to you, we as women, we are at your feet." Korir pleaded.</p>
      <p>"I don't have much, I don't have a big piece of land, but I managed to donate 3 acres to evictees from the Mau. Your Excellency the President, you are blessed, God has blessed your family, cater to the Mau evictees," she added. </p>
      <p>The outspoken legislator stated that those affected by the evictions sought his help, not as members of the Kalenjin community, but as Kenyans.</p>
      <p>She reiterated that the women leaders had no problem with the Building Bridges Initiative, but what it bears. </p>
      <p>However, Ms Korir argued that Kenyans had more pressing issues to worry about, like food prices and the economy.</p>
      <p>"You have told us to rear hens but porous borders are letting in eggs from Uganda at Ksh 9 each while our women sell at Ksh 20. The economy is hurting Your Excellency," she stated.</p>
      <p>"The price of milk has declined from Ksh 29 to Ksh 21(buying price by creameries) while that of tea has declined from Ksh 41 to Ksh 18. That's my cry as a woman," she lamented.</p>

      <p>Her cry for markets and better prices for produce by the people of Bomet followed a similar cry by farmers from the Mount Kenya region.</p>
      <p>On Friday, November 15, President Uhuru Kenyatta addressed all elected and nominated leaders from Central Kenya with the aim to tackle economic issues from the region, and cited tea, milk, and coffee as the major products as reported by <i>Citizen Digital</i>.</p>
