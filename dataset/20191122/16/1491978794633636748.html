      <h1>West Ham United v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:56:13+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/22/Guardian%20Staff" target="_blank">Guardian Staff</a></address>
      <p>José Mourinho would love to begin his reign at Tottenham by heightening the pressure on Manuel Pellegrini. Mauricio Pochettino’s replacement has rarely seen eye-to-eye with his West Ham counterpart, whose side have slipped towards the bottom three during a run of seven games without a win in all competitions. Yet this is a hard one to call. West Ham raise their level in this fixture and Tottenham have not won away in the league since January, which is partly why they felt compelled to replace Pochettino with Mourinho this week. <b>Jacob Steinberg</b></p>
