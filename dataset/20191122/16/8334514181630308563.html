      <p>The Seattle Mariners locked in a piece of their future Friday as top prospect Evan White agreed to a guaranteed six-year, $24 million contract before he has even set foot in the major leagues, according to an mlb.com report.</p>
      <p>If the three options are exercised, the deal would reportedly be worth $55 million, giving both the 23-year-old White and the team some financial security moving forward.</p>
      <p>The No. 17 overall selection in the 2017 draft spent last season at Double-A Arkansas, batting .293 with 18 home runs and 55 RBIs in 92 games. He has hit 32 minor league home runs in 230 games over three seasons.</p>
      <p>White, a University of Kentucky product, is a right-handed hitting first baseman who is highly regarded on defense. He hit 17 home runs in 159 games over three seasons with the Wildcats, batting .356.</p>
