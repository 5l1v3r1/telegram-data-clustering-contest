      <h1>Crowdfunding Watch: Mochi Robot provides LEGO-compatible, screenless coding for kids</h1>

        <b>This one has smashed its target on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pavlyukovskyy/lego-compatible-screenless-coding-for-ages-3-6">Kickstarter</a> – the Mochi Robot that’s aimed at kids aged between 3 and 6. The big selling point, aside from being LEGO-compatible is that it supports a ‘screenless’ approach to learning coding.</b>

      <p>If the significance of this passes you by, its true to say that a lot of STEM toys drive kids towards smartphones and tablets with their use of apps. Not a situation completely to be desired, as the said phones and iPads then self-defeatingly provide plenty more distracting and attention-grabbing diversions…</p>

      <p>The aim of Mochi Robot, its creators say, is to teach children coding concepts while learning their ABCs and 123s and colours. And Mochi himself is a cute brown bear.</p>
      <p>Using story books and maps, and control tokens and a control board, you determine the movement of the Bear-on-wheels around the maps, as part of the story.</p>

      <p>As I said the crowdfunding has been a big success. At the time of writing, with half-a day to go, the project has raised £162,869 from 697 backers, easily beating its £38,709 goal</p>

      <p>It puts me in mind of the <a href="http://www.bitsandbytes.cards/">Bits &amp; Bytes</a> STEM card game (right), which first launched via an <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bits-Bytes-Children-Fundamentals-Computer/dp/B00OZUSXMS">Indiegogo</a> campaign in 2014 and can now be bought on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bits-Bytes-Children-Fundamentals-Computer/dp/B00OZUSXMS">Amazon</a>.</p>
      <h3>STEM</h3>
      <p>Am I doing to many STEM / early-coding stories on Gadget Master? Do let me know, via a comment. It wasn’t a path taken intentionally, but I do notice there seems to be more material in this area… How much is too much?</p>
      <p>Judging by this project’s success on Kickstarter there is a large appetite out there.</p>
