      <p><b>New Delhi:</b> AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday hit out at West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, asking her "to fight the brazen growth of Hindutva" in the state.</p>
      <p>"Mamata Banerjee may have pressure to appeal to majoritarianism these days &amp; that's why this fixation on me. BUT please do your job &amp; fight the brazen growth of Hindutva in Bengal. False equivalence between mobs &amp; those resisting them, isn't helping anyone," Owaisi tweeted citing a media report of the incident.</p>
      <p> </p>
