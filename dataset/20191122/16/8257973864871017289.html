      <p>Nov. 22 (UPI) -- Software giant Microsoft has received permission from the federal government to sell software to Chinese telecom company Huawei Technologies, which for months was barred from doing business with U.S. entities.</p>
      <p>Microsoft said the Commerce Department <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-21/microsoft-granted-u-s-license-to-export-software-to-huawei">granted a license</a> Wednesday to export "mass-market" software to Huawei. It wasn't immediately clear, however, which products are included under that classification but federal officials said the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/11/22/huawei-vs-trump-heres-why-the-next-few-days-are-critically-important/#20c86bcc435c">resumption of licenses</a> is intended for components for which there is little security risk.</p>
      <p>Huawei, China's largest tech company and one of the world's largest smartphone makers, was condemned by the Trump administration as a threat to national security and was barred in May from transacting business with U.S. companies without express government approval.</p>
      <p>Federal regulators resumed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20977446/microsoft-huawei-us-export-license-windows-office-software">giving licenses</a> to U.S. companies this week authorizing such sales.</p>
      <p>"We've had 290-something requests for specific licenses," Commerce Secretary <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Wilbur_Ross/?tps=1">Wilbur Ross</a> said. "We've now been starting to send out the 20-day intent-to-deny letters and some approvals."</p>
      <p>The administration had provided a "support and maintenance" exemption to the ban, which was extended twice this year.</p>
      <p>Huawei postponed the launch of a Windows-powered laptop computer this year, and Microsoft briefly stopped selling the Chinese giant's MateBook X in stores. Both companies operate the Azure hybrid cloud storage solution, which uses Huawei servers.</p>
