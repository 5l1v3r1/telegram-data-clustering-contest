        <b>Juventus owe Manchester United over €1million from their signing of Cristiano Ronaldo last year, and they are expected to pay the Red Devils before the end of the ongoing 2019-20 season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-united-news-cristiano-ronaldo-17300714"><i>Manchester Evening News</i></a> who reports that Juventus’s accounts for the 2018-19 season revealed that Manchester United are due €1.2million from them. And on Friday, sources close to the Premier League giants revealed that it is the “second instalment of a solidarity payment” following Ronaldo’s signing in 2018 July.</p>
      <p>The five-time Ballon d’Or winner joined the <i>Bianconeri </i>for a reported transfer fee of £88million, out of which over £2.2million will go to Manchester United via “solidarity payments”.</p>
      <p>So what are “solidarity payments”? Solidarity payments were introduced by FIFA in 2001, and framed as “compensation” for clubs who initially helped to develop a player between the ages of 12 and 23, but had to part ways with them later on.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo arrived at United for £12.2million at the age of 18 in 2003 from Sporting Lisbon, and six seasons later, Real Madrid came calling.</p>
      <p><i>Los Blancos </i>offered the Old Trafford outfit a then-world record of £80million and the Portuguese ace moved to the Santiago Bernabeu as a result.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo also returned to Old Trafford with Juventus last season, for their game against Manchester United in the Champions League group stages.</p>
      <p>“I can remember what it was like when I was in Manchester. I won lots of trophies here, lots of cups, the league, the Champions League,” he said, before adding:</p>
      <p>“I remember the support as well, the support was fantastic. Sir Alex Ferguson is someone I will never ever forget and I would like to express my best possible wishes to him.”</p>
