      <h1>The Witcher episode titles drop hints about the Netflix show's story</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:45:24+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/fraser-brown/" target="_blank">Fraser Brown</a></address>
      <p>Netflix has revealed the episode titles for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/netflix-witcher-series/">The Witcher</a>, arriving next month, each accompanied by brief descriptions that, together, form a poem. There will be a dragon hunt, flashbacks, monster slaying and it looks like Dandelion will be getting into a spot of bother. </p>
      <p>Here's the list of episode titles, followed by the poem formed by their descriptions. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The End's Beginning</li>
        <li>Four Marks</li>
        <li>Betrayer Moon</li>
        <li>Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials</li>
        <li>Bottled Appetites</li>
        <li>Rare Species</li>
        <li>Before a Fall</li>
        <li>Much More</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <i>A monster slain, a butcher named <br/>We look at a sorceress's earlier days <br/>A picky eater, a family shamed <br/>The Law of Surprise is how one repays <br/>A fateful meeting, a bard is maimed <br/>The hunt for a dragon is underway <br/>A return to before a kingdom is flamed <br/>The Witcher Family as you all like to say</i>
      </p>
      <p>The episodes all have individual symbols, too. The Betrayer Moon, for example, has a bestial footprint that suggests we might be seeing some werewolf shenanigans in the third episode. You can see them all on Twitter. </p>
