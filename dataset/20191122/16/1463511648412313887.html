      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday in Abuja pledged that his administration would ensure that Nigerians have access to affordable, efficient and equitable healthcare services without the risk of impoverishment.</p>
      <p>He made the pledge when he received the report on ‘‘<b><i>Funding Universal Healthcare Delivery in Nigeria’’</i></b>  by the Senior Executive Course 41 of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, near Jos.</p>
      <p>The President directed relevant agencies of government to review the submission and ensure its integration into ongoing policies and programmes.</p>
      <p>He recalled that in late 2018, he approved the study theme for the 2019 Senior Executive Course because of his desire to address the challenges in the country’s health delivery system and improve the wellbeing of citizens.</p>
      <p>He added that “Nigeria is signatory to UN Sustainable Development Goals and committed to achieving Universal Health Coverage aspirations by 2030.</p>
      <p>“This government is unrelenting in its commitment to ensuring that all Nigerians have access to affordable, efficient and equitable healthcare services without the risk of impoverishment.</p>
      <p>“Your findings and recommendations are very innovative and useful. I, therefore, commend the management, staff and participants of senior Executive Course 41 for this report.</p>
      <p>“I assure you that the Ministry of Health and all relevant agencies will be directed to review this submission and ensure its integration into our ongoing policies and programmes,” he said.</p>
      <p>The President also congratulated the Board, Management and Staff of the National Institute on its 40th anniversary.</p>
      <p>He noted that the Institute, despite its funding challenges, has credibly discharged its responsibilities as the nation’s apex multi-disciplinary think-tank.</p>
      <p>While assuring the Board, Management and Staff of NIPSS of his continuous support, President Buhari said whatever challenges they had would be addressed properly.</p>
      <p>The President also congratulated the participants of the Senior Executive Course on successfully completing the program.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the Director-General, NIPSS, Prof. Habu Galadima, said in exploring the theme,  the participants, engaged in series of lectures and seminars, brainstorming sessions, as well as study tours, both domestic and international, with a view to obtaining clear perspectives on funding universal healthcare delivery in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Galadima said: “I can inform Mr President confidently that this Report is a product of thorough and painstaking engagement with relevant stakeholders and critical analysis of the issues and challenges in funding universal healthcare delivery in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“It is our prayer that the government will adopt many of the usable recommendations as part of the ongoing efforts at making healthcare accessible and affordable to all citizens.”</p>
      <p>The Senior Executive Course 41 had 66 participants.</p>
