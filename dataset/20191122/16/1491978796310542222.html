      <h1>Watford v Burnley: match preview</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:06:08+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/22/Guardian%20Staff" target="_blank">Guardian Staff</a></address>
      <p>Watford finally claimed their first league win of the season to lift them off the foot of the table with a 2-0 victory at Norwich. They could make it two from two against a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/burnley">Burnley</a> team who have not won away all season, though Watford are yet to take all three points at home. Burnley’s Chris Wood and Ashley Barnes have ten goals between them so Watford will have to keep them quiet to prevent a record 11th consecutive home game without a win. <b>Will Dickson</b></p>
