      <p><b>RIYADH — </b>King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) and Misk Initiatives Center signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to further expand opportunities for collaboration between the two entities.<br/><br/>The MoU was signed on Thursday, at the sidelines of the Misk Global Forum (MGF), by KAUST President Dr. Tony Chan and the Chairman of Misk Initiatives Center Bader Al Asaker. The agreement outlines an effective partnership between the two parties to unite their efforts towards achieving national development goals in various fields, and their aim to prepare young leaders to contribute to the Kingdom’s development.<br/><br/>“KAUST and Misk share the same values, and we are working together to intensify our efforts in investing in Saudi talents through our academic training and leadership programs,” said Dr. Chan.<br/><br/>“We are also advancing our innovative and entrepreneurial ecosystems by collaborating in national and international events, such as the recent Entrepreneurship World Cup, that contribute to enhancing innovation as a driving force for growth in the Kingdom and the world. The MoU is another example of how we are joining forces towards the realization of Vision 2030 objectives,” he added.<br/><br/>The main areas of collaboration focus on academic and pre-professional development for Saudi secondary school students with emphasis on preparation for internationally-competitive university application and enrollment, entrepreneurial enrichment and promotional activities in the Kingdom, as well as joint education and entrepreneurial exchange programs and events for Saudi youth.<br/><br/>This includes nominating top students from the Misk talent pool to participate in KAUST programs, Saudi Research Science Institute (SRSI), KAUST Gifted Student Program (KGSP), KAUST Saudi Leadership Program for Saudi female leaders (KSLP) and research internships at KAUST.<br/><br/>Al Asaker said, “At Misk we’re committed to collaboration and partnerships with world-leading organizations to deliver on our core mission of empowering young people, both in the Kingdom and internationally. We know entrepreneurship is a driving ambition of many young people. This partnership with KAUST will allow Misk to ensure young people have the skills and training they need to realize this ambition.”<br/><br/>The ongoing cooperation between KAUST and Misk was evident in the recent Entrepreneurship World Cup where both entities joined forces to make it a remarkable celebration of innovation that brought together talents and startups from all around the world starting with the bootcamp that KAUST hosted on campus and reaching to the final pitching event and awarding ceremony that took place as part of the MGF. Both parties look forward to advancing their partnership in line with Vision 2030. — SG</p>
