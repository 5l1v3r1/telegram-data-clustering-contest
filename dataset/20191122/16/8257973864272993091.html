      <p>Nov. 22 (UPI) -- Former <i>Today</i> host <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kathie_Lee_Gifford/?tps=1">Kathie Lee Gifford</a> returned to the morning show on Friday to discuss her move to Nashville and love for the city.</p>
      <p>"I just love it here," <a href="https://twitter.com/3rdHourTODAY/status/1197883748722843648">Gifford said</a> after stating that she bought a small place in Nashville a year ago in anticipation of leaving <i>Today</i> and enjoyed the area so much that she upgraded to a bigger residence.</p>
      <p>"It's a place of joy for me," she continued. "Every time I get on a plane to go back home I would say, 'Why am I so happy here?' and I realized it's because it's a culture of kindness here as opposed to the culture of chaos that exists in so many of our cities now."</p>
      <p>"I felt loved here and received and respected," Gifford said.</p>
      <p>The television personality also discussed how her two children, 29-year-old Cody Gifford and 26-year-old Cassidy Erin Gifford, are <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/11/18/Kathie-Lee-Gifford-celebrates-daughters-engagement/1291574090599/">both engaged</a>.</p>
      <p>"The good news is that I adore both of their partners," she said before noting that her kids do not want her to sing at their weddings.</p>
      <p>Gifford exited <i>Today</i> in April after <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2019/04/04/Kathie-Lee-Gifford-reflects-ahead-of-final-Today-episode/7851554384544/">11 years</a> as host.</p>
