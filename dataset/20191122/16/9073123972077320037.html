        <b>One Fortnite creator has developed an innovative Fortnite box fighting map that promises “zero bugs.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Box fighting has become the meta in Fortnite. Build-battles still happen, but not as frequently as they did in past seasons. There aren’t any items that save you from fall damage this chapter, which makes “cranking” a risky proposition.</p>
      <p>Practicing your high-ground retakes and build battle strategy is still useful, but it’s not as practical as box fighting. You can guarantee a few box fights in a given competitive match, where the build battles have become a bit rarer.</p>

      <p>If someone cranks 90’s on top of you, challenging them probably isn’t the best decision. Most players box-up and wait for their opponent to come to them.</p>

      <p>Since this is the case, box fighting maps have become one of the best ways to practice in Fortnite. There are several maps out there, but all of them seem to suffer from bugs that force you to double-tap your keybinds in order to build, edit, or reload (among other issues).</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIvBByuaiLyxMf5UBRxVuvw">Percy</a>, a Fortnite Creative map builder, has come out with his first box fighting map of Fortnite Chapter 2. He promises “zero bugs” in his map, which remains to be seen.</p>

      <p>We’ll have to jump in and try this map before we can dub it “bug-free.” Almost all of the creative maps I’ve tried in Chapter 2 have a few bugs in them. It isn’t the creators’ fault; it seems to be a problem with Creative Mode itself.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Still, this is an interesting box fighting map that scales with the number of players you have. You can play small 1v1 or 2v2 maps or opt for the larger 3v3 and 4v4 options.</p>

      <p>The best feature might be the zone in the 3v3 and 4v4 map. You won’t be forced to box-up in a corner, which provides a more realistic in-game simulator for small-zone box fighting.</p>
