      <p>Community protection officers (CPO) in Kirkby-in-Ashfield have been praised for their quick thinking in rescuing residents trapped by floodwater.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/weather">rain</a> battered Nottinghamshire on Thursday, November 14, many roads were affected by flooding.</p>
      <p>On the Thursday evening around 5pm three Ashfield District Council CPOs rescued two residents trapped in their cars on Mill Lane in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/kirkby-in-ashfield">Kirkby-in-Ashfield</a>.</p>
      <p>While on patrol they came across the flooded area where water was approximately three foot deep.</p>
      <p>One resident was stuck in her car in the water and the two CPOS managed to get the resident to safety.</p>
      <p>A colleague was called to assist and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottinghamshire-police">Nottinghamshire Police</a> were contacted to block the road.</p>
      <p>During this time another resident drove into the flood water.</p>
      <p>The car was submerged up to the windows with a woman and her 17-month-old baby trapped inside.</p>
      <p>The CPOs rescued both from the car and got them to the safety of their patrol car until they could be transported home.</p>
      <p>They then returned and recovered the car after the floodwater had gone down.</p>
      <p>Theresa Hodgkinson, director of place and communities at Ashfield District Council, said: “The quick thinking of the CPOs saved those residents from getting into real trouble.</p>
      <p>"They showed courage and acted on instinct. All three are a credit to Ashfield District Council, we are extremely proud of them and thankful for their actions.”</p>
