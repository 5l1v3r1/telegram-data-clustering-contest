      <h1>Rosemary is not a rosemary, rules RHS - it's a sage, as they tell gardeners to change plant labels</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/helena-horton/" target="_blank">Helena Horton</a></address>
      <p>Rosemary is not a separate species of plant after all — it is a sage, the Royal Horitcultural Society (RHS) has ruled as they tell gardeners to change their plant labels.</p>
      <p>The RHS is to adopt a change in the scientific name for rosemary after research has shown that is in fact a salvia, or a sage.</p>
      <p>In technical terms it will now be known as <i>Salvia rosmarinus</i>, rather than <i>Rosmarinus officinalis,</i> but its common name – rosemary – remains unchanged.</p>
      <p>This is a significant change, as the plant has been known as <i>Rosmarinus officinalis </i>since  1753 when the international system of naming plants began and salvia and rosemary were deemed to be two different genera.</p>
      <p>Although they have always been thought to be similar, a difference in the  stamens of the plants was held to be enough to view them as separate plant types.</p>
      <p>However, this difference has now been found to be not significant enough to rule them as distinct.</p>
      <p>The RHS will now be changing all its plant labels in its gardens and shops, though they have acknowledged some gardeners may think they are "meddling for meddling's sake".</p>
      <p>A spokesperson explained: "When plant name changes happen there is sometimes some confusion or resistance by gardeners – simply owing to something having been known as something for so long. "</p>
      <p>The change will appear in the next edition of the <i>RHS Plant Finder</i> – the definitive guide to cultivated garden plants available to buy in the UK – and precedes publication of the charity’s rosemary plant trial which recommends those plants that perform best in UK gardens.</p>
      <p>John David, Head of Horticultural Taxonomy at the RHS, said: “Not everyone will approve of this change in the scientific name of a much loved garden plant but it is important that our naming system reflects the latest science otherwise it stands to lose its meaning.</p>
      <p>“Rosemary is one of the most popular garden plants in the UK and gardeners may be surprised and interested to know that it is so closely related to the culinary sage (Salvia officinalis) that it is now put in the same genus, having been considered a different genus (Rosmarinus) for over 200 years."</p>
      <p>“Understanding plant interactions and therefore their uses, which is reflected in the scientific name they carry, could inspire more people to grow for people and planet. We’re certainly not meddling for meddling’s sake by adopting this name change but reflecting the latest research that could help us in conserving our gardens for the future.”</p>
