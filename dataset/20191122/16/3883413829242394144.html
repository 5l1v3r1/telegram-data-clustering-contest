      <p>Plaid Cymru has launched its 2019 General Election manifesto, pledging to scrap Trident.</p>
      <p>The party describes the nuclear deterrent as a "waste of money", claiming that stopping its renewal would allow for £205 billion to be invested in public services.</p>

      <p>Plaid Cymru's manifesto goes on to say the party is "determined to prevent the renewal of a weapon of mass destruction and to scrap Trident".</p>
      <p>The party also states it will resist "all attempts to relocate nuclear weapons in Wales or in Welsh waters".</p>
      <p>Aside from Trident, it pledges to prevent cyber attacks by working with the Government and to base all Welsh regiments in Wales.</p>
      <p>It also wants a vote in the Welsh Assembly before the UK goes to war and states any decision for military intervention overseas should require all four nations' support.</p>
      <p>For military veterans, Plaid Cymru promises "excellent" healthcare, including for mental health, as well as "adequate housing".</p>
