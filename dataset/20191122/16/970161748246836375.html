      <h1>Why Man Utd have no plans to replace Solskjaer with Pochettino</h1>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> have shelved their plans to appoint <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> and are committed to backing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Following <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a>’s sacking last December, Pochettino was at the top of United’s managerial shortlist drawn up by their executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward.</p>
      <p>But the Argentine ended up staying with Spurs while Woodward appointed Solskjaer, initially on a short-term deal before he gave the Norwegian a permanent three-year contract in March off the back of United’s impressive form.</p>
      <p>However, United’s performances have been erratic since Solskjaer was installed as the club’s permanent manager and the team are facing a fight to secure a top-four finish in the Premier League this season.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer also faces even more pressure due to the availability of Pochettino, who was surprisingly sacked by Tottenham earlier this week, less than six months after guiding Spurs to a Champions League final.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://theathletic.com/1396462/2019/11/22/why-manchester-united-are-no-longer-desperate-for-pochettino-even-if-they-did-sound-him-out-on-the-m25/">The Athletic</a>, United have already met with Pochettino to discuss a potential move but the prospect of paying £42 million in compensation to Spurs in order to land the Argentine was a major stumbling block.</p>

      <p>But the report also claims that United are ‘committed’ to Solskjaer’s reign and are backing his ‘long-term vision’.</p>
      <p>Woodward is also said to have been impressed during following a conversation with Solskjaer last December in which the Norwegian showed a flip chart of what his United side could look like in the next three years.</p>
      <p>United’s executive vice-chairman is also said to have been warned by Solskjaer last season that his team would suffer a dip in form at some point.</p>

      <p>On Friday, Solskjaer dismissed the threat of Pochettino taking his job at United now he has become available.</p>
      <p>‘No, it doesn’t bother me at all because I’ve got the best job in the world and I’m sure that if you’re in or out of a job and you are a manager, you would want this job,’</p>
      <p>‘So it doesn’t really matter whatever happens around it.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got to focus on my job at Man United, do it as well as we can, I speak with Ed and the owners all the time about how we are going to move the club forward.</p>
      <p>‘That doesn’t change if some other clubs change their managers.’</p>
