      <p>Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth has branded Britain an illegal colonial occupier after the country failed to meet a UN deadline to hand over an overseas territory to Mauritius, a former British colony in the Indian Ocean, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50511847">BBC reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The country claims it was forced to trade the Chagos Islands in exchange for sovereignty, with the UK purchasing them for £3 million in 1965, when Mauritius was still under British rule.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the UN general assembly voted by an overwhelming majority of 116-6 in favour of the motion demanding that the islands, Britain's last remaining African territory, be reunited with Mauritius. However, the UK refused to regard the UN motion as binding.</p>
      <blockquote>“We have no doubt about our sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory, which has been under continuous British sovereignty since 1814", a Foreign Office spokesperson said adding the African country has “never held sovereignty over the archipelago".</blockquote>
      <p>According to the press service, the territory will remain under British control until "it is no longer needed for defence purposes".</p>
