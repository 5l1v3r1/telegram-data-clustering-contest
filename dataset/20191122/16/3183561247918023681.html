      <p>Earlier today Tesla finally unveiled its long awaited futuristic pickup, the Cybertruck.</p>
      <p>The metal beast looks like something straight out of a dystopian sci-fi novel. But while it looks indestructible, with Musk himself talking up how tough it was, a stage malfunction proved otherwise.</p>

      <p>During the live stream Musk stated that the body of this absolute unit is made of angular stainless steel and is resistant to hammer blows bullets. Even the glass windows were said to be impact resistant.</p>
      <p>Always keen for a bit of dramatic flare, the CEO decided to do a live demonstration. While taking a sledge hammer to one of the car doors went okay, the glass was a different story.</p>
      <p>When a stage hand threw a metal ball at one of the front passenger windows, it cracked the hell out of it on impact. So they tried one of the rear windows... and the same thing happened.</p>
      <p>Whoops.</p>

      <p>It was an ambarrassing moment, but at least Musk was able to have a sense of humour about the ordeal, saying "Weâ€™ll fix it in post."</p>
      <p>As for the specs, the truck will apparently have 200, 300 and 500 mile range options, 6,350kg tow claim, 1,600kg payload claim and adaptive air suspension. The base price will be $US39,000, with the higher end model coming in at $US69,000. Nice.</p>
      <p>It's highly unlikely we'll ever see this bad boy in Australia, but it will allegedly hit some limited markets in late 2021, with a tri-motor variant coming in 2022.</p>
