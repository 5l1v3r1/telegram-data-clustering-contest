      <h1>Amaravati finally finds a place in political map of India</h1>
      <h2>Its non-inclusion in Survey of India map had triggered a row</h2>

      <p>The Survey of India on Friday released a new political map of India with Amaravati as the capital of Andhra Pradesh, which became the residuary State after bifurcation of combined Andhra Pradesh in 2014.</p>
      <p>Amaravati was missing from the new map, which was released by the Survey of India on November 2. It kicked off a political storm with the Opposition TDP and the ruling YSR Congress Party blaming each other for the Centre refusing to recognise Amaravati as the capital of the State.</p>
      <p>The TDP wondered why a city that was launched through the hands of the Prime Minister couldnâ€™t find a place in the Indian political map. The TDP leaders held the State government responsible for it.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, YSR Congress Party rebutted the allegation, saying it was the failure of the previous TDP government in issuing a notification recognising Amaravati as the capital of Andhra Pradesh that resulted in the fiasco.</p>
      <p>Telangana has Hyderabad as its capital and it is the capital for Andhra Pradesh too for a period of 10 years from the date of bifurcation from 2014.</p>
