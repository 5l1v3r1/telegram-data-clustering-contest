      <h1>No prosecutions over death of tragic teen Amber Peat</h1>

      <p>No-one will be prosecuted over the death of 13-year-old Amber Peat who hanged herself in bushes near her home.</p>
      <p>Tragic Amber, a former pupil of <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/education">Tibshelf Community School, in Derbyshire</a>, was found hanged in bushes, on June 2, 2015, three days after going missing from her home in Mansfield.</p>
      <p>Today, following a new review of evidence, the Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: "Following the inquest into the tragic death of Amber Peat, we have reviewed the case once more in light of the coroner’s findings and further material gathered by Nottinghamshire Police.</p>
      <p>"After careful consideration of all the available evidence, we have concluded there is insufficient evidence to prosecute anyone for criminal offences relating to Amber’s treatment up to the time of her death.</p>
      <p>"Amber’s relatives have been updated about the decision. Our thoughts remain with them."</p>
      <p>When evidence not previously considered is heard by a coroner, this can be investigated by the police, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/no-one-prosecuted-over-death-3566096">Nottinghamshire Live reports</a>.</p>
      <p>In this instance, Nottinghamshire Police referred some new evidence to the CPS and asked them to revisit the charging decision in the light of this material.</p>
      <p>This evidence was looked at, alongside all the evidence from the original investigation. The conclusion was that the additional evidence did not materially change the earlier CPS decision from 2016.</p>

      <p>As the investigation and review have resulted in a decision not to bring criminal charges, the CPS said it would not be appropriate to name any suspects.</p>
      <p>A serious case review released in March found that although there were concerns for Amber's 'emotional well-being', her death could not have been predicted.</p>
      <p>The report said Amber felt like she was to blame for many difficulties within the family, while and information-sharing between organisations was found to be 'limited'.</p>

      <p>And an inquest in February heard the schoolgirl was described as 'bright and outgoing', but she appeared withdrawn when with her mother, Kelly Peat and stepfather Daniel Peat.</p>
      <p>The inquest was told that Amber ran away several times when the family lived in Tibshelf and Mansfield.</p>
      <p>But the coroner suggested it was "significant" that this never happened while Mr Peat was in prison, serving time for fraud.</p>
      <p>Her mother suspected her of "attention-seeking" on the last night Amber left home following an argument. The disappearance was reported to police seven hours later, after the couple visited a Tesco and a car wash.</p>

      <p>The coroner recorded a narrative conclusion on Amber but criticised health, education and social care teams in Notts and Derbyshire.</p>
      <p>The coroner said Amber was failed by organisations which should have protected her.</p>
