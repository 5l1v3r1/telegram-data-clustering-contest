      <p>Katie Price has brutally slammed Emily Atack in a furious social media rant, over a joke she made about her on I’m A Celebrity’s spin-off show Extra Camp.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the TV presenter suggested her co-hosts Joel Dommett and Adam Thomas needed to get tested for STDs, after they took a dip in the same pool Katie and her ex Peter Andre once hooked up in.</p>
      <p>Responding to Emily’s comment on her Instagram Story today, Katie uploaded a video of her holding the backpack she had in the jungle back in 2004.</p>

      <p>In the video, Katie rages: “So Emily Atack, you think it’s clever do you to slag me off? Who are you anyway? Looks like I’m coming for you.”</p>
      <p>“You got something to say to me, don’t say it behind my back on telly, say it my face.</p>
      <p>“All the men I know you’ve been with haven’t got a good thing to say about you,” she said, before waving her hand in front of her face and saying, “Urgh, fishy.”</p>
      <p>Emily is yet to respond to Katie’s rant.</p>
