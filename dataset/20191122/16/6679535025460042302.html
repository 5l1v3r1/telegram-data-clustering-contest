      <h1>Sub Lieutenant Shivangi is the first-ever woman pilot for Navy</h1>
      <h2>From a moffusil girl in Bihar to becoming the first woman pilot of Indian Navy, it’s been a long journey</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:44:46+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/S-Anandan-297/" target="_blank">S. Anandan</a></address>
      <p>The thrum of a hovering helicopter with a Minister on board was what hooked Shivangi, a wide-eyed 10-year-old from Bihar’s Muzzafarpur, to flying.</p>
      <p>But then, as a regular moffusil girl born to a school teacher and a housewife, life moved on and she went on to graduate in mechanical engineering from the Sikkim-Manipal Institute of Technology.</p>
      <p>While in college, a naval presentation made as part of a university entry scheme again stoked the latent desire in her to fly. She cleared the Service Selection Board (SSB) at Bhopal, but failed to get a call thanks to fewer vacancies.</p>
      <p>A few months into her MTech at the Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur, she attended another SSB in Bengaluru and made the cut. That was in 2018. After a six-month-long Naval Orientation Course at the Indian Naval Academy at Ezhimala, she spent another six months getting the hang of flying on a Pilatus basic trainer at the Air Force Academy (AFA).</p>
      <p>The last six months were with the Kochi-based Indian Naval Air Squadron 550, known as ‘Flying Fish’, the alma mater of naval aviation in India, where she learnt to fly the Dornier maritime reconnaissance aircraft.</p>
      <h3>Making history</h3>
      <p>On December 2, Sub Lieutenant Shivangi will earn her ‘wings’, going down in history as the first-ever woman to steer an Indian naval aircraft to the skies.</p>
      <p>“You don’t need to be super talented to fly an aircraft, but you need to work really hard and stay focused,” she says.</p>
      <p>“Flying goes against your natural instincts. Hence the importance of focus and skill sets,” she adds.</p>
      <p>“But she’s an altogether different person in the cockpit – a quick learner and an adept flyer,” vouches Lieutenant Commander Rahul Yadav, one of her instructors at INAS 550.</p>
      <p>Before joining the Navy, Shivangi had only seen the sea in Goa as a tourist. “At Muzzafarpur, Navy meant sailing to people and naval aviation was unknown. Maybe now it will have better visibility,” she says.</p>
      <h3>Bigger dreams</h3>
      <p>She has logged some 100 flying hours so far, with over 60 on the Dornier as part of the course.</p>
      <p>This will be followed by another six months of mission-based flying in which she will get to learn to exploit the aircraft for its operational role. The bigger dream, however, is to eventually qualify to fly the P8I long-range maritime recce aircraft.</p>
      <p>By December-end, two more women pilots of the Navy, Sub Lt. Shubhangi and Sub Lt. Divya will also get their wings at Yelahanka where they trained with the Air Force.</p>
      <p>They will then join Shivangi and three other officers for the Dornier Operational Flight Training.</p>
