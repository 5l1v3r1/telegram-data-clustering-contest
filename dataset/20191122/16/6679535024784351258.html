      <p>Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Friday asked Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani to prepare a diet chart for pregnant women and provide it to all Lok Sabha members for circulation in their respective constituencies.</p>
      <p>“We should make a collective effort to end malnutrition in the country. If we can create a mass movement to end malnutrition in the country... I hope it will be eradicated by the last session of this [17th] Lok Sabha,” Mr. Birla said, when questions relating to malnutrition were taken up during Question Hour.</p>
      <p>He also urged Lok Sabha members to spread awareness on malnutrition in their respective constituencies.</p>
      <p>“The Minister should make a region-specific diet chart for pregnant women and circulate this to MPs and a collective effort should be made in this regard,” he said.</p>
      <p>Answering a question, Ms. Irani said data from the NITI Ayog showed that only 9% of families were getting the right nourishment and the quality of food was more important than quantity.</p>
