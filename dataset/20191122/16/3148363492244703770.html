      <p>“I tell you, look, we have to stand with Hong Kong, but I’m also standing with President Xi. He’s a friend of mine. He’s an incredible guy,” Trump said.</p>
      <p>The president spoke with <i>Fox &amp; Friends</i> in a phone interview, highlighting the ongoing protests in China and his trade negotiations.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of protesters occupied Polytechnic University this week in Hong Kong, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/remains-of-protest-on-trashed-hong-kong-idUSRTX79XIQ">fighting off</a> a police siege with improvised weapons.</p>
      <p>Trump said he would like to see President Xi and the protesters work out a deal as he continued negotiating with them on a trade agreement.</p>
      <p>“I stand with Hong Kong, and I stand with freedom,” he continued.</p>
      <p>Trump said he remained insistent that President Xi and China not take lethal action against the protesters in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>“If it weren’t for me, thousands of people would have been killed in Hong Kong, and we wouldn’t have any riots; you would have a police state,” he said. “The only reason he’s not going in is because I’m saying it will affect our trade deal, and he doesn’t want to do that.”</p>
