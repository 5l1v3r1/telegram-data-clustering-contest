      <p>Lactalis American Group is getting nearly $1 million in grants and tax credits from New York State to help pay for its $11.2 million expansion project at its South Buffalo cheese factory.</p>
      <p>The incentives, approved Thursday by Empire State Development, are an important part of a financing package that helped convince Lactalis officials to expand the South Park Avenue factory, rather than make a similar investment to upgrade sister factories in Idaho or Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>The expansion project led to the purchase of $8.4 million in new equipment to expand the production capacity of the Buffalo factory, which is the biggest producer of ricotta cheese in the world and the second-largest of Lactalis' nine factories in the United States.</p>
      <p>The expansion project, which was completed in August, did not create any new jobs, but helped retain the 569 positions already at the plant, state officials said.</p>
      <p>The expansion was mainly done to replace and upgrade a mozzarella cheese production line at the factory.</p>
      <p>Lactalis executives first approached state officials in 2017, seeking incentives for the project.</p>
      <p>"Without ESD assistance to lower costs and make the company's facility competitive with Lactalis' location in Idaho and Wisconsin, the cost would have been too high to make the project feasible in New York and the investments would have been made elsewhere," the state economic development agency said.</p>
      <p>Empire State Development approved a $632,728 capital grant for the project and agreed to provide Lactalis with up to $344,865 in tax credits through the Excelsior Jobs Program, provided the company maintain its 569-person workforce through the beginning of 2024.</p>
      <p>Lactalis more than two years ago added a 6,300-square-foot addition to its South Park facility, which also serves as the corporate headquarters for the French company's U.S. operations.</p>
