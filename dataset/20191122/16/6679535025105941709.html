      <h2>Will consult people at the earliest opportunity: Gotabaya Rajapaksa</h2>

      <p>Sri Lanka’s new President said on Friday that he will call a snap parliamentary election in March following his sweeping victory in the recent presidential poll</p>
      <p>Gotabaya Rajapaksa is hoping to ride a wave of popularity by calling an election six months before the current Parliament’s five-year term expires on March 1.</p>
      <p>“I will consult the people at the earliest opportunity I get under the Constitution,” he said, after swearing-in a new Cabinet headed by his brother Mahinda, a former President who will now serve as the Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>The brothers are credited with brutally defeating Tamil separatist militants in 2009 to end Sri Lanka’s bloody civil war, making them adored among the majority Sinhalese-Buddhist majority. For the same reason they are feared by many Tamils, and also among the Muslim minority who have seen increased hostility since the Easter Sunday attacks in April.</p>
      <p>Currently the Rajapaksas and their allies have just 96 lawmakers in the 225-seat parliament, making it hard for them to pass legislation. The Opposition of outgoing premier Ranil Wickremesinghe is also six MPs short of a majority. The new 16-member Cabinet also includes another Rajapaksa brother, Chamal, who was made Minister of Agriculture and Irrigation in addition to Trade.</p>
