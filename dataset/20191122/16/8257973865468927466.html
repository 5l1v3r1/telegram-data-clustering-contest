      <p>Nov. 22 (UPI) -- Residents of a Florida neighborhood said a car that drove in circles in reverse for about an hour only had a single occupant -- a dog.</p>
      <p>Police said the driver of the car in Port St. Lucie had gotten out and left the vehicle running, and the dog then apparently knocked the vehicle into reverse.</p>
      <p>Neighbors said the car was moving for about an hour before police were able to stop it.</p>
      <p>"First I thought I saw somebody backing up but then they kept going and I'm like OK what are they doing," Sabol <a href="https://www.wpbf.com/article/neighbors-find-dog-behind-the-wheel-of-moving-car/29875948">told WPBF-TV</a>. "The cops came and I'm like OK."</p>
      <p>Police were able to enter a code to open a door, stop the car and rescue the dog.</p>
      <p>Sabol said the car hit a mailbox, some garbage cans and some bricks in front of a home while the canine was behind the wheel.</p>
      <p>"He was doing pretty good until he hit the mailbox. He went around for about an hour without hitting anything at all," Sabol<a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/region-st-lucie-county/canine-joyride-port-st-lucie-dog-hits-car-into-reverse-drives-in-circles-for-nearly-an-hour"> told WPTV.</a></p>
