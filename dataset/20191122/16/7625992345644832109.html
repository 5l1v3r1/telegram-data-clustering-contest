      <p>At the Akal truck stop in Laramie, Wyoming, the Indian food that Mintu Pandher and his staff are cooking up in a small kitchen attracts truckers and locals from miles around, with food they can't find anywhere else along Interstate 80.</p>
      <p>Turns out there's money in all those smells of tumeric, coriander, and other spices rarely used in truck stop cuisine: his cafe is a hit, especially with the changing face of trucking, since nearly 19% of long-haul truck drivers in America are now immigrants.</p>

      <h3>Dal (Lentil Curry)</h3>
      <p>Recipe by Mintu Pandher</p>
      <p>
        <i>Ingredients:</i>
      </p>
      <p>2 tbsp ghee, or 1 tbsp oil + 1 tbsp butter <br/>2 green cayenne chillies, deseeded and cut into chunks (optional) <br/>1 medium onion, finely chopped (brown or yellow)<br/>6 garlic cloves, finely chopped<br/>1 tbsp ginger, finely chopped (3/5")<br/>8 fresh curry leaves, or 6 dried<br/>1 tomato, chopped<br/>1/2 tsp ground cumin<br/>1 cup dried chana dal, yellow split peas or other yellow lentils <br/>4 cups water<br/>1/2 tsp turmeric powder<br/>1/8 tsp garam marsala<br/>3/4 tsp salt<br/>Fresh coriander/cilantro sprigs (optional)<br/>Steamed basmati rice</p>
      <p>
        <i>Instructions:</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rinse lentils and leave to soak in plenty of water for 1 hour. Drain in colander.</li>
        <li>Heat ghee/oil in a heavy-based saucepan over high heat. Add green chillies and fry for a minute until starting to blister.</li>
        <li>Add onions and fry until softened.</li>
        <li>Lower heat to medium; add garlic, ginger and curry leaves. Cook for 1 minute until garlic starts to turn golden and smells amazing.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes and cumin; cook until tomatoes start to break down and thicken to a paste (about 2 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add lentils, water, tumeric and salt. Stir, bring to simmer, cover and simmer gently for 1 hour. Stir two or three times during the hour.</li>
        <li>Remove lid and simmer gently for 30 minutes to thicken, stirring every now and then. The dal is ready when it has a consistency like porridge – some lentils should be intact, but some have broken down to thicken the sauce.</li>
        <li>Stir through garam masala at the end. Adjust salt if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve Dal over rice, garnished with a sprig of coriander if desired.</li>
      </ul>
