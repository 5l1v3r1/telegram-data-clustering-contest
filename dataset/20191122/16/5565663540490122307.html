      <p>IN A shocking development, one of the soldiers guarding President Emmerson Mnangagwa at State House fired several rounds of live ammunition earlier this week, before he was apprehended as he was about to reload his gun, the Daily News reports.<br/><br/>The soldier - who has been identified as "Private Mugadu" - is said to have been sent for psychiatric examination after the worrying incident to establish his mental well-being.<br/><br/>This comes after both Defence minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri and her permanent secretary, Mark Grey Marongwe, recently told legislators about the desperate financial situation that is currently confronting the military.<br/><br/>"Without any warning, the soldier pumped 30 shots into the air, sending many people into panic before some brave soldiers close to him managed to apprehend him as he was reloading his gun.<br/><br/>"The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon and I understand that the soldier is currently detained," a source told the Daily News yesterday.<br/><br/>"This young man has a troubled history and once said that he wanted to resign after serving three years, because it is allowed in the army.<br/><br/>"In fact, there were 10 of them who wanted to do that at the time, who took their letters to Commanding Officer Samson Murombo — who, however, allegedly tore up their letters," the source said further.<br/><br/>Another source said when Mugadu accused his superiors … of living it up while the rank and file were suffering. As of yesterday (Thursday), he was said to be no longer co-operating — insisting on seeing the president or the Defence Forces commander (General Philip Valerio Sibanda).<br/><br/>Mugadu is said to have a history of mental health problems which is said to have been detected when he was about 15. He also has a 23-year-old brother who is also said to be mentally ill.</p>
