      <p>Intermedia AnyMeeting is a web-based <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/cloud-services/9067/the-best-video-conferencing-software">video conferencing</a> software solution designed for small to midsize business (SMB) customers. Aside from video communication, the platform also features a variety of tools for hosting webinars and collaborating during online meetings, something Intermedia has enabled via a small but fairly intuitive collection of collaboration and screen-sharing capabilities.</p>
      <p>Intermedia AnyMeeting is not a new entrant into the video conferencing segment. The platform has been around in some shape or form since 2011 and was originally called Freebinar. Intermedia acquired AnyMeeting in 2017, and has since sold the service as a standalone product as well as part of its <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/internet-telephony-voip/89215/intermedia-unite">Intermedia Unite</a> Unifed Communications-as-a-Service (UCaaS) platform. Intermedia Unite delivers a much larger package of business communication tools centered on Voice-over-IP (VoIP) and cloud-based <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/48914/pbx">Private Branch Exchange</a> (PBX) features.</p>
      <h3>Plans and Pricing</h3>
      <p>This review focuses on the Pro plan of the standalone Intermedia AnyMeeting Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution, desktop apps, and Android and iOS mobile apps. If you purchase Intermedia AnyMeeting as part of Intermedia Unite, then its functionality will be the same according to the company.</p>

      <p>On its own, Intermedia AnyMeeting begins at $9.99 per user per month for the Lite plan. This plan includes video and web conferencing for up to 10 attendees, 200+ web phone participants, 10 HD video participants, <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/internet-telephony-voip/41717/the-best-business-voip-providers">VoIP</a>/<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/49921/pstn">Public Switched Telephone Network</a> (PSTN) audio calling, unlimited meetings, custom meeting URLs, recurring meetings, instant and scheduled calls, screen sharing (desktop and apps), and meeting chat with attendance reports and chat reports. The plan also includes J.D. Power-certified 24/7 support with a reported 99 percent uptime.</p>
      <p>The Pro plan (which is the version I reviewed) costs $12.99 per host per month, and includes video and web conferencing for up to 30 attendees, 200 web plus phone participants, 12 HD video participants, VoIP and PSTN audio calling, unlimited messaging, customer meeting URLs, recurring meetings, instant and scheduled calls, meeting lock, screen sharing (desktop and apps), meeting chat, remote control, and presentation uploads. There's also in-meeting file sharing, record meeting functionality, unlimited recording cloud storage, meeting notes, custom branding, and international dial-in numbers.</p>
      <p>There's even <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/productivity-2/73936/zapier">Zapier</a> integrations, with more than 1,000 third-party business apps (check the Intermedia website for more details). The Pro plan also includes attendance reports and chat reports plus J.D. Power-certified 24/7 support, and the same reported 99 percent uptime. If you're in the healthcare industry, then also know that Intermedia AnyMeeting is <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/44279/hipaa">Health Insurance Portability &amp; Accountability Act</a> (HIPAA)-compliant. Companies looking to evaluate InterMedia AnyMeeting can try out either of its plans via a 30-day free trial offer. However, there's no free version of this solution.</p>
      <p>In terms of pricing, the Intermedia AnyMeeting Pro Plan compares favorably with competing solutions, including the $12.49 per host per month price charged by <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/bluejeans-meetings">BlueJeans Meeting</a> or the $14.99 per host per month that <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/roundup/340618/301-the-best-business-voip-providers-and-cloud-pbx-service">Zoom Meeting</a> costs. SMBs have a good selection of solutions to consider, and will likely find feature differentiation beyond the basic video and voice conferencing features.</p>

      <h3>Setting Up and Initiating Video Conference Calls</h3>
      <p>Users can set up calls on their Account Page. Once signed in with an email address and password, they're moved to the Account Manager page. This page includes three main buttons: Start a Meeting Now, Schedule, and Join a Meeting.</p>
      <p>Start a Meeting Now is for initiating a meeting quickly and enables users to start an instant meeting. Schedule is for setting up future meetings and likely where most SMBs will initiate upcoming meetings. From this section, users have the choice of setting up a meeting, a webinar (available only with Webinar Pro plans), or a phone conference, which will be a voice conference without the video component. Clicking on Meeting brings up a page where organizers can title a meeting, select a day on the calendar, choose a time, select meeting duration, and choose a time zone. This is also where up to 30 attendee e-mail addresses can be added to a meeting.</p>
      <p>For instances in which a larger group of participants is required, then Intermedia AnyMeeting will suggest that users schedule a webinar instead. The last button is Join a Meeting, and it simply opens up a page on which participants can key in a meeting URL.</p>
      <p>As a participant, you'll receive an email invitation with the links to the meeting or an option to dial in by phone. There are also calendar invitations that can be attached to the invite email and lets recipients add the conference call to their <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/microsoft-office-2019">Microsoft Outlook</a> or Google Calendar schedules.</p>
      <p>The Account Page also has various useful links and items. This includes a Live Support Online button as well as quick access to the meeting URL. There's also the optional dial-in number for users who want to participate by phone and the associated PIN number. Intemedia AnyMeeting offers users various ways to set and join meetings, making it a little more comprehensive than a basic solution such as <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/video-conferencing/69477/clickmeeting">ClickMeeting</a>, which doesn't offer an option for personalized dial-in numbers.</p>
      <p>The Account Page has neatly organized tabs for My Meetings (for past and scheduled meetings), Recordings (which offers quick access to recorded meetings or seminars), and Content Library. The latter is the place to upload any Microsoft PowerPoint presentations or Adobe PDF documents you might want to use for your presentation (currently the only two file types supported).</p>

      <h3>One-Click Video Conferencing in Specific Conditions</h3>
      <p>When using Intermedia AnyMeeting via the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/google-chrome">Google Chrome</a> browser, participants can simply click on the meeting link they receive in the invite email. After that, they're immediately taken to a webpage that asks for a name and email address and then initiates the meeting. Chrome users who have ad blocker or specific plug-ins enabled can run into issues such as blank meeting pages. To solve this, they'll need to open the meeting URL link from an Incognito mode tab or window on their browser. However, I was not aware of this workaround until a contact from Intermedia suggested it to me. The workaround isn't mentioned in Intermedia AnyMeeting's documentation, so the issue could leave some meeting participants stranded with a blank webpage. I was later told by Intermedia that the OneLogin for Google Chrome plugin was the reason why AnyMeeting wouldn't run on a regular brower webpage, and that disabling the plugin would solve the issue.</p>
      <p>Users of non-Chrome browsers, such as Apple Safari, Opera, and FireFox, will need to download and install a desktop client to join an Intermedia AnyMeeting session. This is because non-Chrome browsers don't fully support the Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) framework that Intermedia AnyMeeting uses for quality web communications. Installing the desktop client makes sense as a general rule. This browser-agnostic approach should work with fewer issues than trying to standardize everyone on Chrome.</p>
      <p>Still, I tested Intermedia AnyMeeting on a <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/tablets/119251/microsoft-surface-go-with-lte-advanced">Microsoft Surface Go</a> running the Chrome browser to test out the instant meeting capabilities. Other ways to easily join meetings include using persistent meeting URLs or meeting codes as well as permanent conference PINs that can be added to email signatures and business cards.</p>
      <p>Intermedia AnyMeeting also has mobile apps for Android or iOS devices. I tested the Android mobile app, which replicates the basic functionality of the desktop client. It does require that participants use their smartphones in landscape mode since this mirrors the orientation of PC monitors. One issue with this is that smartphones and their front-facing cameras are designed to be used in portrait mode, which makes the current iteration of Intermedia AnyMeeting a bit unwieldy on smartphones.</p>
      <p>Aside from that, however, the Intermedia AnyMeeting Android app works well enough with latency-free video and audio on a Wi-Fi connection. But considering the capabilities of the desktop client, customers will probably only use the mobile versions of this service as a last resort. There are just too many rough spots on the mobile client at the moment. For example, aside from the phone's orientation, you also need to make sure it stays awake. If your smartphone goes to sleep, then the app shuts off, effectively disconnecting you from the conference. Additionally, the Android lacks documentation, so users who aren't familiar with the desktop version might find it confusing at first.</p>

      <h3>User Interface Features Useful Widgets</h3>
      <p>Viewed via a desktop web browser, however, Intermedia AnyMeeting's web user interface (UI) is intuitive and well-designed. The left-hand side has a main section where attendees are listed by name. Small icons quickly let you know who is connected, whether they're muted or not, whether their video cameras are on or not, and the strength of their internet connection. Next to Attendees is Chat, a window where participants can post questions or chat with each other via text. Next to that is a Notes tab, which allows all users to enter notes during the call. These notes are saved, and can be accessed by any meeting participant during the call and then emailed to participants after the meeting.</p>
      <p>The top ribbon has easy access to toggle microphone and video camera controls, offers organizers the option to share their screen or upload files such as a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation or a PDF file for presenting, and it also has the option for the organizer to record the call. A telephone icon can be used to switch from video conferencing to a voice call, which is convenient in situations where video is not needed or where connectivity is poor. There are also icons that show how strong your data connection is, a Help button, and a button for exiting the call. Intermedia AnyMeeting allows for basic branding so SMBs can add their logos to give their video conference a more official, less generic look.</p>
      <p>Intermedia AnyMeeting provides HD video conferencing but with a 720p max resolution. It features screen sharing as well as annotation tools that let participants write on a screen, even if they are not the ones presenting. By using a pen or a finger on my Microsoft Surface Go, I was able to draw basic lines as well as circle text over the presenter's Microsoft PowerPoint presentation. The ability to annotate right on the screen collaboratively and in real time with little lag can help remote teams work on detailed presentations or reports, provided their PCs have the capacity for pen or finger input.</p>
      <p>I was also impressed by the recording and sharing capabilities that Intermedia AnyMeeting provides. At the end of one meeting using the Pro product, I received an email with the recording URL to a website that I could access after entering my name and email address. I was given the option of watching the video of the meeting or listening to just the audio, which was in available .MP3 format. Participants are also given the option to share the link with persons who may have not attended the video conference. This is convenient for disseminating corporate meetings, training videos, and possibly even video podcasts. It's nice that Intermedia AnyMeeting includes the feature rather than having to generate a recording link via third-party app.</p>
      <p>Again, be aware that the video quality is limited to 720p HD resolution, which is similar to several competitors, though these days I would have liked to have seen the option for higher HD resolutions as you would find from players such as <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/productivity-2/85803/microsoft-teams">Microsoft Teams</a>. Additionally, video is played back by using <a href="https://www.jwplayer.com/">JW Player</a>, which is rather basic. That said, it is helpful to be able to revisit a video conference as well as share it by using a simple web address. Most built-in PC webcams default to a 720p HD video resolution.</p>
      <p>Intermedia AnyMeeting's video and audio quality was consistently clear and lag-free on both the online (web-based) and mobile clients (Android). I appreciated the various available ways to communicate, which included voice and video in real time, the Chat UI for sending questions while not interrupting the speaker, and the Notes functionality for typing quick ideas.</p>
      <p>Post-meeting emails include access to notes as well as a link to the recorded meeting, which is helpful for transitioning from a meeting to reminding participants of next steps and deliverables.</p>

      <h3>Adds Value with Collaboration Features</h3>
      <p>Overall, Intermedia AnyMeeting will meet most SMBs' video conferencing needs, and goes beyond basic voice and video calling with the addition of various interactive and collaborative features that can enrich video conferences by engaging participants. I liked that it offers many post-meeting options, including the ability to share meeting recordings and files with participants, since, for many businesses, video conferences are the starting points to a longer list of deliverables. These features can really help with post-call productivity.</p>
      <p>Intermedia AnyMeeting aims for ubiquity by having web, desktop, and mobile clients to easily enable participants to get on calls by using the tools and methods that work best for them. However, the best experience is definitely via a Chrome browser or by downloading the desktop app as Intermedia AnyMeeting's mobile apps still need considerable polishing and non-Chrome browsers are effectively not supported.</p>
      <p>InterMedia AnyMeeting is slightly more affordable than our Editors' Choice pick <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/video-conferencing/9083/cisco-webex-meetings">Cisco Webex Meetings</a> but, considering how much more polished that solution is, Cisco retains the lead. Still, if you're price-conscious or if you're already an Intermedia Unite customer, then this is a solid video conferencing solution with good collaboration features at a competitive price.</p>
