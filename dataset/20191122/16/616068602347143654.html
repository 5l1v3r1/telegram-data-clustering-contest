      <p>A downtown Penticton business is lamenting damage caused by vandals to a mural on their building.</p>
      <p>“Messaging the artist you commissioned to tell them that someone had defaced their artwork is a nasty way to start your day,” said Cowork Penticton on Facebook. “We're gutted that our beautiful 'Calliope' has been tagged.”</p>
      <p>The mural was painted by local artist<a href="http://www.skylerpunnett.com/"> Skylar Punnett</a>, who was hired by Cowork to beautify the exterior of the Nanaimo Avenue offices.  </p>
      <p>The business thanked the Penticton RCMP and city bylaw department for responding, adding the graffiti has since been removed from the plain section of the wall by Pure Pressure Graffiti Removal.</p>
      <p>“Fixing Skyler Punnett's art will be trickier, but we will find a way,” Cowork said. “And we will still plan to keep beautifying our building in the face of mindless vandalism.”</p>
