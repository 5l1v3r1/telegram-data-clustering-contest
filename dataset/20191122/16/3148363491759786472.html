      <p>Friday, President Donald Trump went after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) during a live phone interview with “Fox &amp; Friends” over the “scam” impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>Trump lamented having to “deal with crazy Nancy,” calling her “crazy as a bedbug.”</p>
      <p>“I have to deal with crazy Nancy. I mean, she’s crazy as a bed bug. She is nuts,” Trump said. “What she’s doing — and she’s not talented. She’s highly overrated. All she’s doing is sitting. She’s not doing anything for the people. And now it turns out that the whole impeachment thing is a scam.”</p>
