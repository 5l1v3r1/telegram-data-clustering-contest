      <h1>Former NHS worker said coming out as gay triggered £100 a week vodka addiction</h1>
      <h2>She is now trying to warn others of the dangers after she used to blackout and wake up covered in blood</h2>

      <p>An NHS worker who drank alcohol to function at work said she spent £100 a week on vodka before turning her life around.</p>
      <p>Sarah Glasby, 46, from <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Mansfield</a>, said she started drinking heavily when she was 21.</p>
      <p>But became dependent on drink when she was disowned by her family after coming out as gay at 32.</p>
      <p>She now wants to warn others of the dangers of liver disease as Nottinghamshire has a higher number of alcohol-related hospital admissions compared to the national average.</p>
      <p>Miss Glasby, who used to work in a mental health unit, said: "I had a normal life – I got married, had a child, held down a good job with the NHS.</p>
      <p>"But I was a functioning alcoholic. I was drinking so I could function at work, so I wouldn’t shake.</p>
      <p>"Looking back, I spent all my life hiding. I knew about my sexuality – that I was gay.</p>
      <p>"I came out when I met somebody at work.</p>
      <p>"I left my marriage and my family disowned me.</p>
      <p>"I began to hide drink and I was convicted for drink driving.</p>
      <p>"I felt really lonely and lived in a rented house by myself.</p>
      <p>"Alcohol was my safety – my only friend. It was the only thing that didn’t judge me.</p>
      <p>She said as soon as she finished work, she would buy a bottle of vodka and drink half of it on the train journey home.</p>
      <p>"I had a litre of vodka with me most of the time at home. I would put it in other bottles to disguise it when I was going out.</p>
      <p>"I was spending about £100 a week. The doctor said if you carry on down this path you are not going to be here.</p>
      <p>"I would have blackouts and seizures. Sometimes I’d wake up covered in blood. I couldn’t remember how I got home.</p>

      <p>She decided to come off alcohol on her own, but withdrawing had its own complications,</p>
      <p>"I had a seizure at a family wedding in Spain.</p>
      <p>"I had psychosis and they put me in a hospital. But even that didn’t stop me drinking.</p>
      <p>"I went back on the drink on several occasions and tried giving up again.</p>
      <p>Her sister-in-law took her to a doctor which told her about Change Grow Live (CGL) - a charity which helps people with alcohol addiction in Nottinghamshire.</p>
      <p>She finally managed to break her relationship with booze on June 17, 2018.</p>
      <p>She said: "I stuck with it. I’ve thrown myself into the courses. I’m really determined.</p>
      <p>"I’ve achieved so much in 16 months. I’ve passed my driving test again and got my licence back, I’m doing volunteer work and I’m building my relationship with my daughter.</p>
      <p>"Breaking up with vodka is the worst divorce you’ll ever have.</p>
      <p>Dr Stephen Ryder, consultant hepatologist of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/health/">Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust</a>, said: "Liver disease is a silent killer and people don’t often realise they have a problem until it’s too late.</p>
      <p>"But the good news is that when liver disease is caught early, it can be treated, halted, or even reversed.</p>
      <p>"Drinking within recommended limits and taking three consecutive days off alcohol a week can drastically reduce the risks of liver disease."</p>
      <p>The CCG said alcohol-related hospital admissions are "significantly higher" in Nottingham compared to England. The rate (per 100,000 population) of admission for alcohol related conditions was 881 in Nottingham compared with 632 in England (2017/18).</p>
