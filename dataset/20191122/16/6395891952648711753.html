      <p><b>CAMBRIDGE, EnglandÂ (AP)</b> - The chamber hushed as the debate got underway at the Cambridge Union and the teams launched into their carefully crafted opening statements.</p>
      <p>The topic - whether artificial intelligence would do more harm than good - was something each side had a big stake in because both were using the technology to deliver their arguments.</p>
      <p>Cambridge University, home to the world's oldest debating society, was the setting Thursday night for a demonstration of what the future might hold. IBM's Project Debater, a robot that has already debated humans, was for the first time being pitted against itself, at least in the first round.</p>
      <p>Artificial intelligence "will not be able to make a decision that is the morally correct one, because morality is unique to humans," the computer system said in a synthetic and vaguely feminine voice.</p>
      <p>"It cannot make moral decisions easily and can lead to disasters. AI can cause a lot of harm," it continued. Artificial intelligence can only make decisions it has been programmed for and "it is not possible to program for all scenarios, only humans can."</p>
      <p>Then, the machine switched sides, delivering the opposing team's argument.</p>
      <p>Artificial intelligence "will be a great advantage as it will free up more time from having to do mundane and repetitive tasks," it said, its voice embodied by a blue waveform on a screen set into a two-meter-tall sleek black monolith-like pillar.</p>
      <p>Audience members at the society, which has hosted notable figures including British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the Dalai Lama, and Microsoft founder Bill Gates over its 200-year history, were spellbound by its first non-human guest.</p>
      <p>After first pitting the technology against a human last year, IBM challenged it to present opposing arguments, in a display of its latest advances.</p>
      <p>Unlike its earlier debate, which relied on analyzing a huge trove of newspaper and magazine articles for its replies, researchers this time crowd-sourced contributions from 1,100 Cambridge students and fed the answers to the computer.</p>
      <p>They wanted to find out, "Can you use the technology to generate a compelling narrative that will help the decision maker to take a better decision?" said lead scientist Noam Slonim.</p>
      <p>The system had to identify which side the crowd-sourced contribution was on, rank the best arguments, filter out spelling mistakes and bad grammar, then present a persuasive five-minute statement - a process IBM said took about a minute.</p>
      <p>Potential applications for the technology include helping a company or government carry out surveys or gather feedback from clients.</p>
      <p>The night wasn't totally devoid of humanity.</p>
      <p>Project Debater quipped, "Let's move to an issue close to my artificial heart: technology," drawing laughter from the crowd.</p>
      <p>And then human debaters took over in the rebuttal and closing rounds, while also jokingly dubbing the computer "Debbie" and "Cybertronia the All-Knowing."</p>
      <p>At the end of the night, audience members sided with the argument that artificial intelligence does more good than harm.</p>
      <p>Its future is assured, at least for now.</p>
