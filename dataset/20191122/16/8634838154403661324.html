      <h1>Senate to Slash DP Ruto's Retirement Package</h1>

        <b>As 2022 approaches and the potential <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46694-martha-karua-tells-uhuru-over-pm-position">future leadership of the country</a> unclear, Deputy President William Ruto can expect to take home a retirement kitty lesser than that of his predecessors if the Senate passes a bill aimed at reducing the benefits of a retired deputy president.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is after a Senate committee adopted the recommendations of the Retirement Benefits (Deputy President and Designated. State Officers) (Amendment) Bill (Senate Bills No. 2 of 2018) sponsored by Narok Senator Ledama Ole Kina on Wednesday, November 20.</p>
      <p>The proposed amendments sought to either change or erase a number of clauses from the Retirement Benefits Act.</p>

      <p>The Retirement Benefits (Deputy President and Designated State Officers) Act, 2015, stipulates that “a retired deputy president shall, during his or her lifetime, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to eighty percent of the monthly salary of the entitled person’s last monthly salary while in office.”</p>
      <p>"He is also entitled to a <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46397-reason-behind-mama-ngina-kenyattas-lucrative-govt-pay">lump sum payment on retirement</a>, calculated as a sum equal to one year’s salary paid after every four years among other benefits," the Act adds.</p>
      <p>On August 7, Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja proposed to have the interval in the clause increased from four years to five years.</p>
      <p>Nominated Senator Farhija Ali also petitioned to have the interval with which a retired deputy president was entitled to a new saloon car not exceeding 2000cc and a 4x4 vehicle, from four years to five years.</p>
      <p>If passed by Parliament, it would subsequently result in the reduction of DP Ruto's projected retirement kitty (if he was to retire after 2022) in that, he would make a third less after three regimes than what his predecessors enjoyed. </p>
