      <h2>Committee to guide administrator through insolvency process</h2>

      <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has formed a three-member advisory committee to assist in the administration of troubled mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd.</p>
      <p>The three members are Rajiv Lall, non-executive chairman, IDFC First Bank Ltd., N. S. Kannan, MD and CEO, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd. and N.S. Venkatesh, CEO, Association of Mutual Funds in India.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the RBI had superseded the board of the home financier and appointed former MD and CEO of Indian Overseas Bank R. Subramaniakumar as the administrator.</p>
      <p>“The Reserve Bank, in exercise of powers conferred under section 45 IE 5 (a) of the RBI Act 1934, has today constituted a three-member advisory committee to assist the administrator of DHFL in the discharge of his duties,” the central bank said in a statement. The RBI had also said bankruptcy proceedings will be initiated against DHFL, which had defaulted on bank loans.</p>
      <p>The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Rules, 2019 have a provision for the financial sector regulator concerned to appoint a committee to advise the administrator in the operations of the financial service provider during the corporate insolvency resolution process.</p>
      <p>While superseding the DHFL board, the RBI had said the action was taken due to governance concerns and defaults in meeting payment obligations. DHFL’s total debt is over ₹80,000 crore, with banks having an exposure of almost ₹40,000 crore. ICICI Bank, Union Bank of India, Central Bank of India and UCO Bank are some of the lenders that had classified the loans as ‘non-performing’.</p>
