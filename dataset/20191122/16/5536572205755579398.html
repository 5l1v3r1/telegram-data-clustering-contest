      <h1>NFL Claims To Not Have Audio of Steelers-Browns Fight, Parabolic Mic Could Be Seen Showing Otherwise (PIC)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:09:23+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:09</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>A league source told <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2019/11/nfl-had-no-recorded-sound-from-the-field-in-determining-if-mason-rudolph-hurled-a-racial-slur-at-myles-garrett-source-says.html">cleveland.com</a> that the National Football League had no recorded sound from the field in determining if Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph hurled a racial slur at Myles Garrett.</p>
      <p>Garrett argued in his appeal hearing that Rudolph hurled the slur.</p>
      <blockquote>“We looked into it and found no such evidence,’’ NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told cleveland.com in an email response. The report goes on to state the NFL based its conclusion on the game official’s report, any camera angles available, as well as Referee Clete Blakeman who stated he did not hear a racial slur.</blockquote>
      <p>As you know, social media can be quite relenting and a few people went back and found a guy clearly holding a parabolic microphone which likely proves they have the audio and could be withholding it because it might prove what Myles Garrett said was true.</p>
