      <h1>Beck Insists He’s Not a Scientologist</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:53:52+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.spin.com/author/andy_cush/" target="_blank">Andy Cush</a></address>
      <p>For non-Scientologists, enjoyment of <a href="https://www.spin.com/tag/beck">Beck</a>’s music has always been a little complicated, given his public affiliation with and support for the <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/mothers-day-actress-leah-remini-rips-scientology-destroying-families-1955-1423300">repressive and cultlike</a> religious organization. But now you can play your just-purchased copy of <i><a href="https://www.spin.com/2019/10/beck-hyperlife-uneventful-days/">Hyperspace</a> </i>in peace.</p>
      <p>“I am not a Scientologist,” <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/culture/music/workaholic-beck-i-feel-a-little-guilty-if-something-s-too-easy-20191118-p53bnh.html">Beck told</a> the <i>Sydney Morning Herald </i>in an interview published Friday morning. “I don’t have any connection or affiliation with it. My father has been a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/mothers-day-actress-leah-remini-rips-scientology-destroying-families-1955-1423300">Scientologist</a> for a long time, but I’ve pretty much just focused on my music and my work for most of my life, and tended to do my own thing … I think it’s just something people ran with.”</p>
      <p>We’re glad that Beck is speaking his truth, but it’s not strictly accurate that his association with the Church is “just something people ran with.” As <i>The Hollywood Reporter </i><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/beck-says-he-is-not-a-scientologist-1257357?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_medium=referral">points out</a>, he publicly affirmed his membership multiple times, without much vagueness. “Yeah, I’m a Scientologist,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100915054237/http://www.tribune.ie/article/2005/jun/12/a-sort-of-homecoming/">he told</a> the <i>Irish Sunday Tribune </i>in 2005. “My father has been a Scientologist for about 35 years, so I grew up in and around it and stuff.”</p>
      <p>Beck’s apostasy might have something to do with his recent divorce from Marissa Ribisi, the <i>Dazed and Confused </i>star and prominent Scientologist to whom he had been married since 2004. The pair split in February.</p>
