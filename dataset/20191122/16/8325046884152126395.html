      <p>There are few celebrity relationships that stand the test of time in the public eye, but married couple <a href="https://www.insider.com/kristen-bell-dax-shepard-toxic-relationship-habit-2017-10">Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard</a> have been together since 2007.</p>
      <p>Just recently, <a href="https://www.today.com/video/kristen-bell-remembers-the-first-time-she-met-husband-dax-shepard-73880645593">Bell shared than when she and Shepard first met,</a> she didn’t actually feel any sparks – but it seems her feelings have changed since.</p>
      <p>Here is a comprehensive look at the couple’s relationship timeline.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>2007: Bell and Shepard met at a dinner party, but didn’t have an immediate connection.</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.today.com/video/kristen-bell-remembers-the-first-time-she-met-husband-dax-shepard-73880645593">In 2019,</a> Bell told “Today” that she actually felt “no sparks whatsoever” when she met now-husband Shepard in 2007.</p>
      <p>The two first spoke at an intimate dinner party and they’d both recently gotten out of long-term relationships</p>
      <p>“The one thing I remember is that he talked so much,” she said, adding that she didn’t even know who he was at the time.</p>
      <p>She explained that two weeks later they both met at a Detroit Red Wings hockey game and started flirting.</p>
      <p>“When I met her and her friends, I was suspicious of their unbridled happiness,” Shepard told <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/relationships/a32083/kristen-bell-dax-shepard-marriage-works/">Good Housekeeping magazine</a> in 2015. “I thought, ‘Something stinks here; they’re in a cult.’ But slowly I began to see her positive way of looking at the world. She gives people the benefit of the doubt.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>2007: The pair started dating but were fighting often, according to Bell.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>In an interview with Harry Connick Jr., Bell revealed that when they met, their relationship was somewhat “toxic.”</p>
      <p>“When we first met, <a href="https://www.insider.com/kristen-bell-dax-shepard-toxic-relationship-habit-2017-10">we fell madly in love and I love the dramatic exit.</a> There is nothing I crave more,” she said. “We’d get in a fight because we’d fight a lot, and I’d yell something and then slam the bedroom door, then I’d slam the front door, then I’d get in my car and then I’d skid out the driveway and I would sit around the corner in my car and it felt so good and I realized how incredibly toxic it was only after he pointed it out.”</p>
      <p>She went on to say that “Three months into our relationship he was like: ‘You can’t leave anymore during fights. I’m not going to do that.'”</p>
      <p>Bell said this made her realize Shepard was right and she has since changed her fighting methods.</p>

      <h3>~2007: Bell revealed the couple broke up before getting engaged.</h3>

      <p>In 2017, Bell <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Kristen-Bell-Quotes-About-Dax-Shepard-August-2017-43883480">told Popsugar</a> that she and Shepard actually broke up after dating for about three months.</p>
      <p>“He sat me down and said, ‘I can’t have this right now. I think you’re wonderful, but I am still dating other people,'” she said. “And then I, like, liquefied and fell to the ground, but I felt incredibly respected that he had the balls to tell me we weren’t in the same place.”</p>
      <p>She continued to say that Shepard quickly realized he made a mistake and came back a few days later.</p>

The message said, “12 years ago today I came out of my last toxic, life-threatening stupor. I now have a wife &amp; babies &amp; some self-esteem <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gratitude?src=hash">#gratitude</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/promises?src=hash">#promises.</a>“</p>
      <p>The same year, <a href="https://www.playboy.com/read/20q-dax-shepard">Shepard told Playboy that his addiction</a> was a source of conflict for him and Bell.</p>
      <p>“All the things I’d done were terrifying to her, and she had a hard time believing I would ever be able to stay married and monogamous and a father and all those things. For the first year and a half we were together that was what we battled over almost weekly,” he said.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>When Shepard started directing “CHIPS,” a film based on the 1970s cop drama, he turned down Bell for the role of his awful ex-wife.</p>
      <p>He explained to USA Today that she was too “<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/03/19/kristen-bell-is-terrible-in-chips-movie-just-ask-dax-shepard/99288048/">damn likable</a>” to play a character who tortured others.</p>
      <p>“I’m glad he likes me,” said Bell. “But I threw down a not-so-thinly-veiled threat: ‘I can be very unlikable. Welcome to the next week of your life.'”</p>
      <p>Bell quickly proved that she had what it took to handle the role and Shepard cast her.</p>
      <p>“It was one of my riskier moves, but she crushed it,” said Shepard. “She is just so unlikable here, which is crazy because she really is so likable.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>January 2018: Shepard guest-starred on Bell’s show “The Good Place.”</h3>

      <p>On season two of the show, Shepard made a cameo appearance as a demon that hit on Bell’s character Eleanor.</p>

      <p>“Right back at you, bud,” said Bell.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In the inaugural episode of <a href="https://armchairexpertpod.com/pods/kristen-bell">his podcast “Armchair Expert,”</a> Shepard invited Bell on as his first guest. Over the course of an hour, they talked about their upbringings, their moral philosophies, and their relationship.</p>
      <p>When discussing how different they are as people, Bell explained that she grew up as a strict rule follower and saw the world in black and white before she met Shepard.</p>
      <p>“You’re taught that there is good and evil and I just don’t believe that anymore,” said Bell. “When there is happiness, I don’t run from it.”</p>

      <p>“I like my vape pen quite a bit. I smoke around my husband and it doesn’t seem to bother him,” Bell said. “Weed rules. Weed is my drug of choice, for sure.”</p>
      <p>During the interview, Bell stressed that although her husband is sober he doesn’t seem to mind that Bell drinks or smokes weed around him.</p>
      <p>“He likes drugs and alcohol,” Bell explained. “He’s just aware that he lost his privilege with them because he can’t handle it. His brain does not have the chemistry to handle it.”</p>
      <p>Despite Bell stating her husband doesn’t mind, <a href="https://www.insider.com/people-criticizing-kristen-bell-saying-she-smokes-weed-2018-9">people were quick to have opinions</a> on her choice.</p>

I know how much it got in your way. And I know, because I saw, how hard you worked to live without it,” Bell wrote.</p>
