      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>App Store Connect server-to-server notifications have been expanded.</li>
        <li>Developers will now be told when a subscription fails due to a billing error.</li>
        <li>They'll also receive information about the last 100 IAPs, too.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Apple has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=11222019a&amp;1574438522">today updated</a> (via <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/22/apple-expands-app-store-connect-server-to-server-notifications-for-developers/">9to5Mac</a>) its App Store Connect server-to-server notifications to give developers improved information on why a user's subscription has failed. They'll also be told when the issue has been rectified, too.</p>
      <p>As part of the change developers will also now receive a unified receipt covering the last 100 <a href="https://www.imore.com/app-store">in-app purchases</a> to have been made.</p>
      <blockquote>Server-to-server notifications from the App Store let you receive real-time updates in a subscription's status, so you can provide customized experiences for your subscribers. New notifications are now available when a subscription renewal fails due to a billing issue and when a billing issue is resolved by the App Store. In addition, a unified receipt containing information about the latest 100 in-app purchase transactions is now included with the notification. If you've already enabled server-to-server notifications in App Store Connect, you'll automatically receive the new notifications and unified receipt for these subscription events.</blockquote>
      <p>All developers with server-to-server notifications enabled will automatically receive the new real-time subscription notifications with no additional work required on their part.</p>
      <p>These changes will likely be well received by developers who were previously kept in the dark when a subscription renewal failed. Notifications about failed in-apppurchases due to billing issues could potentially be very useful for those dealing with customer support requests, for example.</p>

Apple was previously ordered to pay $503 million to VirnetX, but that's now been overturned.</a>
