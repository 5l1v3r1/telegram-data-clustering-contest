      <p>A preschool worker was filmed slapping a three year-old boy hard across the face for spitting his spaghetti onto the floor.</p>
      <p>Heather Reese, 41, pleaded no contest to assaulting the youngster at a court hearing Friday, a month after the attack at Bright Beginnings Childcare in Toledo, Ohio.</p>
      <p>That means she has been convicted of the crime without admitting to the allegations she faces.</p>
      <p>Disturbing surveillance footage shows Reese, dressed in an orange T-Shirt, grabbing the arm of the boy while he stands next to her at a table.</p>
      <p>She can be seen spoon-feeding the boy the pasta, before striking him across the face with her right hand after he regurgitates it.</p>

      <p>Reese slapped the boy so hard he stumbled backwards, but she was holding onto him, and was able to stop him falling.</p>

      <p>The youngster’s mother Cassie Sullivan arrived at the daycare shortly after her son was attacked, and said he was so upset he could barely talk.</p>
      <p>She told abc13: ‘It’s sickening, and I’m mad.</p>
      <p>‘It’s horrible. She struck him very, very, very hard. He almost fell.</p>
      <p>‘I walked in there… He was screaming, crying, hard to catch his breath.</p>
      <p>‘He held on to me and didn’t let go.</p>
      <p>‘I noticed the red mark with welts and a scratch on the left side of his face.’</p>
      <p>Sullivan was able to establish what had happened to her son, and called police.</p>
      <p>Probation officers are now set to investigate further before Reese is sentenced on January 10, the <a href="https://www.toledoblade.com/local/courts/2019/11/22/daycare-worker-enters-plea-for-slapping-toddler/stories/20191122091">Toledo Blade</a> reported.</p>
      <p>She was fired from the daycare after attacking the boy.</p>
      <p>Bright Beginning owner Kristen Hill apologized to Sullivan, and said her facility has a zero-tolerance policy on any kind of abuse.</p>
