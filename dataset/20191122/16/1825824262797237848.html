      <h1>Raptors officially unveil City Edition jerseys, Welcome Toronto schedule</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Kern</a></address>
      <p>They were leaked the other day, but this morning the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/toronto-raptors">Toronto Raptors</a> officially unveiled their 2019-20 City Edition look.</p>

      <p>As expected, the jerseys feature a Drake/OVO-inspired black-and-gold color theme, with the “Toronto” word mark in the retro Raptors font across the front. The back of the jersey also features the spikes above the player name seen on the original Raptors jerseys, and has the jagged pinstripe on the side.</p>
      <p>And yes — the gold patch representing Toronto’s NBA Championship is there on the back of the collar as well! Also, from that photo it looks to me like the “Toronto” across the front is larger than in the photos seen the other day. Maybe my eyes are playing tricks on me, but I think it looks better. All in all, I think it’s a great mix of old and new.</p>
      <p>Along with the jersey reveal, the Raptors have also announced when the team will be wearing them; they’ll once again host six “Welcome Toronto” nights, starting this coming Wednesday against the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/new-york-knicks">New York Knicks</a>:</p>

      <p>The full Welcome Toronto schedule is as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wednesday, November 27 vs. New York Knicks</li>
        <li>Wednesday, December 25 vs. <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/boston-celtics">Boston Celtics</a></li>
        <li>Friday, January 17 vs. <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/washington-wizards">Washington Wizards</a></li>
        <li>Friday, February 21 vs. <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/phoenix-suns">Phoenix Suns</a></li>
        <li>Monday, March 16 vs. <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/golden-state-warriors">Golden State Warriors</a></li>
        <li>Tuesday, March 24 vs. <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/los-angeles-lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>I’m not sure the “Welcome Toronto” theme really works anymore — didn’t we welcome everyone here during the dang <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba-finals">NBA Finals</a>, after all? Everyone knows who we are now! — but I guess they gotta get some use outta that fancy Welcome Toronto court, right? (And I admit — I do like that court!)</p>
      <p>The tweet above mentions the jerseys will be “available” November 27, which I assume means you’ll be able to purchase one for yourself at the team shop.</p>
      <p>What do you think: Will you be purchasing a new City Edition jersey?</p>
