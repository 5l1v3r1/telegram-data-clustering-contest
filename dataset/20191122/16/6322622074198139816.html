      <p>SINGAPORE (Nov 22): CATL and BYD Co saw sharp declines in sales of electrified-vehicle batteries in September, as demand weakened in China, where the government is cutting subsidies in the EV sector.</p>
      <p>Sales by market leader Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd fell 10%, while BYD’s slumped 71%, causing it to lose its No. 3 ranking to South Korea’s LG Chem Co, SNE Research said. CATL had 26.6% of the global market in the first nine months, followed by Panasonic Corp at 24.6%.</p>
      <p>China is trying to navigate weaker demand for cars and a slowing economy, while also pulling back subsidies to avoid a bubble bursting in the EV market. The country’s lackluster auto sales are weighing on the wider global market.</p>
      <p>“Weak demand in China is expected to continue and there’s still uncertainty in the U.S. market,” SNE Research said in a statement Friday. “We could continue to see smaller growth for the full year.”</p>
      <p>CATL’s shares rallied 5% in Shenzhen on Friday, boosted by an extra order from BMW AG, while BYD eked out a 0.8% gain in Hong Kong.CATL is down about 13% from a March high and BYD is 37% below its 2019 peak hit in April.</p>
      <p>Analysts favour CATL, with 27 buy recommendations, five holds and eight sells, among those tracked by <i>Bloomberg</i>. BYD has only eight buy or equivalent ratings, nine holds and 12 sells.</p>
