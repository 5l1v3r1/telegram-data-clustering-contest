          <p>Mohammad Kaif takes a sly dig at the 16-year-old bowling sensation from Pakistan over where he highlights an old tweet mentioning the young bowler to be 17-year-old.</p>

                      <p>According to the book, his age is much different than the age he used at the time of his cricketing career. Thus, with this, Kaif has certainly aroused attention and suspicion towards the bowler’s real age.</p>
                      <p>The Pakistani bowler has drawn praises from all over the world for his undeniable talent. <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/naseem-shah-test-debut-16-year-old-pakistan-spearhead-amidst-limelight-ahead-of-gabba-test/">The 16-year-old bowler made his debut</a> this week in the ongoing Test series between Pakistan and Australia.</p>

                            <p>While watching his bowling, it was clear that the youngster made <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/watch-naseem-shah-troubles-australia-a-batsmen-with-extreme-pace-in-perth/">David Warner and Joe Burns uneasy on the field</a> with his extreme pace. Further, it took him only 7 overs to take his first international wicket.</p>
