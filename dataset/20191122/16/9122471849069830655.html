      <h1>Reggie Miller Revealed When Zion Williamson Is Expected To Make NBA Debut</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:43:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Pelicans fans have been eagerly awaiting the NBA debut of Zion Williamson, since the team drew the No. 1 lottery pick. But a knee injury has forced everyone to wait even longer.</p>
      <p>On Thursday night, NBA analyst Reggie Miller had an inside scoop on when we all might finally get to see the super-talented Zion.</p>
      <p>During yesterday’s game between the Pelicans and the Phoenix Suns, Miller said “a little birdie” told him that we can expect to see Zion in mid-December. Miller’s source told him that his recovery from a knee injury is on schedule.</p>
      <p>The initial timeline for his recovery was expected to be six to eight weeks, so it appears that the former Duke star is right on schedule.</p>

      <p>Arguably the most hyped prospect since LeBron James, Zion dominated the college ranks en route to countless accolades.</p>
      <p>He looked to be <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/zion-williamson-fans-freaking-out-pelicans">as good as advertised</a> during Summer League as well. But his knee injury forced him to push off his regular season debut just before the start of the season.</p>
      <p>Head coach Alvin Gentry supported that timeline when asked about Williamson’s status on Thursday. From <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/Zion-Willamson-injury-return-updated-by-New-Orleans-Pelicans-head-coach-Alvin-Gentry-138999071/">247Sports</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Everything is progressing as it should,” Gentry told reporters yesterday. “It’s a time thing, and we’re not going to rush it. He’s not going to rush it. As far as the progress that he’s making, everything is fine and right on time, really.”<br/><br/>Williamson is just over four weeks into rehab for a projected 6-8 week injury. His projected return date with that time table would be somewhere between Dec. 3 at home against Dallas and Dec. 17 against Brooklyn. Pelicans hope to have him back and at full strength before a marquee Christmas Day matchup at the Denver Nuggets.</blockquote>
      <p>As for the Pelicans, they’ve been doing their best to stay competitive as they await their prized rookie’s return.</p>
      <p>After starting 1-7, the Pelicans have won five of their last seven games.</p>
      <p>Will Zion Williamson be as good as advertised when he finally makes his debut?</p>
