      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/luis-suarez/">Luis Suarez</a> has backed Liverpool to win the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> title and believes it is difficult to see <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s side slipping up.</p>
      <p>Liverpool are currently nine points ahead of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> after 12 games played having extended their advantage with a 3-1 win over Pep Guardiola’s side before the international break.</p>
      <p>But Klopp’s men had a similar advantage last December before they were overhauled by City and lost out by a single point on the final day of the season.</p>
      <p>Suarez, however, believes Liverpool will not make the same mistake again.</p>
      <p>‘[Winning the Premier League] is difficult because the season is very long,’ Suarez told <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/soccer-transfers/story/3995508/barcelonas-luis-suarez-mls-transfer-a-nice-possibility">ESPN</a>.</p>

      <p>‘But they have a nice advantage at the moment and with this current Liverpool side, it’s complicated [to imagine] them letting that slip.</p>

      <p>‘But we all know how football is.</p>
      <p>‘They had a similar advantage at one stage last season and, in the end, Manchester City won the league.</p>
      <p>‘We were close to winning the league at Liverpool with young players.</p>
      <p>‘We almost managed it without the budget they have today.</p>
      <p>‘Given everything Liverpool are now, to have won it then would have had more merit.’</p>
