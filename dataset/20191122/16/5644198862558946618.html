      <p>MILAN:Â Cristiano Ronaldo is '99 per cent' certain to miss this weekend's Serie A trip to Atalanta after his four-goal spree for Portugal in Euro 2020 qualifying, coach Maurizio Sarri confirmed on Friday (Nov 22).</p>
      <p>Juventus visit fifth-placed Atalanta on Saturday looking to retain top spot in Serie A ahead of Inter Milan before hosting Atletico Madrid in the Champions League next week.</p>

      <p>"The problem is on Tuesday Cristiano returned and said that it was good for the first game with Portugal but less in the second," said Sarri.</p>
      <p>"We have developed a programme for him and now, the goal is the match of Tuesday against Atletico Madrid," said Sarri adding: "for Atalanta, 99 per cent he will not be available."</p>
      <p>Ronaldo had been substituted in Juventus's last two games with Sarri saying that the 34-year-old had a "little knee problem".</p>
      <p>The five-time Ballon d'Or winner was furious after being hauled off before the hour in their last game against AC Milan.</p>
      <p>"We talked on Tuesday, and at certain times you have to left players cool down," said Sarri.</p>
      <p>"There is no need for explanations. I've coached since the 90s and reactions to substitutions were the same even in amateurs and sometimes much worse."</p>
      <p>Sarri's side are just one point ahead of Antonio Conte's Inter Milan after 12 matches, with Lazio and Cagliari eight points adrift of the leaders in joint third.</p>
      <p>Atalanta have gone three league games without a win, and are two points off the final Champions League berths, before next week's trip to Shakhtar Donetsk.</p>
      <p>Sarri said Atalanta were a tricky team to face.</p>
      <p>"Annoying is an understatement. They play with intensity and aggressiveness but also have great technical quality," said the former Chelsea and Napoli boss.</p>
      <p>"The best definition was given by (Manchester City coach Pep) Guardiola - facing Atalanta is like going to the dentist, you can get out well but also with pain."</p>
      <p>Atalanta's fortunes have slipped following the thigh injury to Colombian star Duvan Zapata, who scored six goals in six Serie A matches before being sidelined for their last five league games.</p>
      <p>As Atalanta sweat on Zapata's return, Juventus will be without full-back Alex Sandro, Adrien Rabiot, and Juan Cuadrado.</p>
      <p>There are also doubts of Miralem Pjanic and Blaise Matuidi.</p>
      <p>"When after seven games in 20 days they go to the national team they all come back full of small problems and little ailments."</p>
      <p>Inter will be looking to make it a perfect seven league games on the road this season as they travel to Torino, before their European trip to Slavia Prague.</p>
      <p>Conte's side face a tough task against the Andrea Belotti-powered Torino, who ended their six-match winless run against Brescia last time out, and are in 11th position.</p>
      <p>Serie A runners-up Napoli are in crisis, having slipped to seventh, and desperately need a result at 14th-placed AC Milan, who are themselves floundering.</p>
      <p>Cagliari and Lazio will look to continue their strong form at lowly Lecce and Sassuolo respectively.</p>
      <p>Roma have a chance to move into the Champions League places as the look to bounce back from last week's defeat to Parma at home against tailenders Brescia.</p>
      <p>

      <p>Carlo Ancelotti's Serie A runner-up last season head for AC Milan amid reports he has two games left to save his job.</p>
      <p>Napoli have gone four games without a win in Serie A to sit seventh.</p>
      <p>The southerners have 19 points -- 13 behind leaders Juventus -- their worst tally after 12 games since the 2011-2012 season when they finished fifth.</p>
      <p>After being held 1-1 by Salzburg in the Champions League, they travel to Liverpool next week in a key game for the former Chelsea, AC Milan and Real Madrid boss.</p>
