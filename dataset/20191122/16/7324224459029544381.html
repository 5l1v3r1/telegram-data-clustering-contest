      <h1>Roadworks on M5 to be completed by Christmas</h1>
      <h2>Highways England has announced roadworks are set to be lifted from the M5 in Oldbury before Christmas.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:32:16+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/jamie-brassington/" target="_blank">Jamie Brassington</a></address>
      <p>The roadworks have brought two years of misery, as repairs have been made to a viaduct between J1, West Bromwich, and J2, Oldbury.</p>
      <p>Speed restrictions of 30mph and narrow lanes have caused congestion for motorists.</p>
      <p>The announcement will be welcomed, as the completion date has been pushed back numerous times due to bad weather.</p>
      <p>Ground crews have completed all concrete repairs and waterproofing on the southbound carriageway.</p>
      <p>Roadworks on the southbound will start being lifted on November 25, and three lanes will be reopened by mid-Decemebr, a Highways England spokesman said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the final stages of work are taking place on the northbound carriageway, ahead of a full opening before Christmas.</p>
      <p>There will still be a 50mph speed limit in place until the new year for technology testing to take place.</p>
