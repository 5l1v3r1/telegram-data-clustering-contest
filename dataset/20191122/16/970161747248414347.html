      <p>Naomi Watts was all smiles as she was honoured at the 71st Bambi Awards on Thursday night, just weeks after her <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/29/game-thrones-prequel-starring-naomi-watts-cancelled-hbo-11007755/">Game of Thrones prequel series was scrapped</a>.</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old actress, who was due to play the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/03/naomi-watts-binge-watched-game-thrones-three-months-admire-tenacity-10510119/">lead role in HBO’s upcoming Westerosi drama Bloodmoon</a>, put this bad news behind her as she headed out to Germany for the swanky ceremony.</p>
      <p>The Bambi Awards are a prestigious night of celebration, where stars in the world of arts, sports and culture that inspire the German people are awarded with a swanky golden deer accolade.</p>
      <p>Arriving in Baden Baden, Naomi looked incredible as she wore her blonde hair in a chic choppy bob, which she paired with red lipstick and long pearl earrings as she accepted her award for Best International Actress.</p>
      <p>However, all eyes were on the Mulholland Drive star’s incredible Dior dress, with the gown featuring a tiered skirt, different styles of netting and intricately embroidered flowers covering the front panel.</p>

      <p>It seems the actress was just as much of a fan of her outfit as we were, writing on Instagram: ‘What a lovely night, in a lovely dress, thank you to @dior and thanks to @bambi_awards for my lovely [deer emoji].’</p>

      <p>It’s been a tough month for Naomi, who expressed her frustration at her Game of Thrones pilot not getting the go ahead by ‘<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/31/naomi-watts-brushes-off-game-thrones-prequel-axe-screaming-11022196/">screaming it out’ on Instagram</a>.</p>
      <p>Even with John Simm, Miranda Richardson and Marquis Rodriguez making up the cast and a pilot already being shot, it seems Naomi’s series couldn’t survive the Long Night, with producer Jane Goldman reportedly emailing the cast to tell them the news.</p>
      <p>Instead, HBO have greenlit a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/30/george-rr-martin-confirms-separate-game-thrones-spin-off-prequel-cancelled-11014998/">full series of another prequel</a> after fears that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/01/game-of-thrones-prequel-axed-by-hbo-over-fears-it-would-alienate-fans-11024659/">Bloodmoon would ‘alienate’ fans</a> following the somewhat, erm, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/19/game-thrones-petition-remake-season-8-one-million-signatures-counting-9598723/">controversial final series of Game of Thrones</a>.</p>
