        <b>The use of artificial light at night is a major driver in declining insect populations.</b>
      </p>
      <p>That is according to an international study, which examined the rapidly declining numbers.</p>
      <p>It is a joint venture by researchers from Tufts University, McDaniel College and Washington University in the US, Canada's Universit√© Laval and the University of Melbourne.</p>
      <p>The authors have<b><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3378835"> published a paper</a></b> in the SSRN - formerly known as Social Science Research Network.</p>
      <p>They say concerns over the declining population could have an impact on food security and ecological communities.</p>
      <p>They say: "Habitat loss, pesticide use, invasive species, and climate change all have likely played a role, but we posit here that artificial light at night (ALAN) is another important - but often overlooked - bringer of the insect apocalypse."</p>
      <p>"Light is the source of all life on this planet and anthropogenic [human-caused] changes to the natural light environment should be predicted to affect all life that has evolved within it - that is to say, almost all life on Earth".</p>
      <p>The article looks at numerous studies that demonstrate the ways in which ALAN impacts nocturnal and diurnal insects.</p>
      <p>This includes effects on development, movement, foraging, reproduction and predator risk.</p>
      <p>The authors also say that the challenge of artificial light at night is not simply a matter of concern for cities and suburbs, but rural and protected areas.</p>
      <p>They say artificial lighting follows humans wherever they go - and is directly contributing to the loss of insects and biodiversity.</p>

      <p>A recent study also suggests that the US and Canada have lost more than three billion birds since 1970.</p>
      <p>This massive reduction in population involving hundreds of species are related directly to the loss of insects.</p>
      <p>The coalition 3billionbirds.org says one in four birds have been lost in that time.</p>

      <p>Dr James Karl Fischer of The Zoological Lighting Institute in New York says: "Just as was the case for early climate change science, we have to take the insect apocalypse seriously.</p>
      <p>"If we really hope to prevent a terrible situation from getting worse, these issues should not be avoided. Insects are lynch-pins of the environment and necessary for other kinds of animals to survive.</p>
      <blockquote>"A diversity of insects is crucial to maintaining our own food supply.</blockquote>
      <p>"The amount of personal control we have here gives us a bit of hope.</p>
      <p>"It is an easy matter to eliminate, reduce or change the ecologically devastating artificial lighting in and on our homes, schools, businesses if we want to, simply by turning off exterior lights.</p>
      <p>"But we have to want to, and be willing to explore alternatives to the functions those lights currently serve."</p>
