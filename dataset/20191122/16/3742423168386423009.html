      <p>Folding laundry is a huge pain, but fitted sheets are in a category of their own. Those round elastic “corners” never match up, and even if you manage to get one side of the sheets semi-flat, the other side will inevitably bunch up. Fortunately, there’s a technique that actually works.</p>
      <p>To get a fitted sheet into a nice flat rectangle, the key is to have all the corners tucked into each other. Observe:</p>

      <p>Watch the video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHTyH2nuFAw&amp;feature=emb_logo">YouTube user Hisgirl777</a> for a better demonstration, but here are the steps:</p>
      <p>1. Take the sheet warm out of the dryer (for fewer wrinkles) and shake it out.</p>
      <p>2. Lay the sheet down with the long side facing you (across your body).</p>
      <p>3. Stick your fingers into the bottom left corner.</p>
      <p>4. Take the opposite corner right above it and pull it over the corner in your hand.</p>
      <p>5. Repeat on the right side: place your right hand in the bottom right corner, then pull the opposite corner over it. You’ll now be holding the corners in each hand.</p>
      <p>6. Turn the corners in your left hand over the corners you’re holding in the right. Now all four corners will be on your right hand.</p>
      <p>7. Lay down this new square and smooth it out.</p>
      <p>8. Square off the corners as best you can.</p>
      <p>9. Fold into rectangles.</p>
      <p>When you’re done you might not even be able to tell it’s a fitted sheet. Now you don’t need to stuff balls of fitted sheets in your linen closet or drawers—and chances are, it’ll save some precious storage space.</p>
