      <p>The <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/sea/seattle-mariners">Seattle Mariners</a> and first-base prospect Evan White have agreed to a six-year, $24 million contract with three club options, sources familiar with the deal confirmed to ESPN's Jeff Passan on Friday.</p>
      <p>White, 23, spent all of last season at Double-A with the Arkansas Travelers of the Texas League. No player at that level has ever received a long-term extension.</p>
      <p>In 2018, the <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> signed <a href="http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/35276/scott-kingery">Scott Kingery</a>, who had played a full season at the Triple-A level, to a six-year, $24 million deal that could max out at $42 million combined. <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33867/eloy-jimenez">Eloy Jimenez</a> of the <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chw/chicago-white-sox">Chicago White Sox</a> also signed a long-term deal in Triple-A before making it to the majors.</p>
      <p>White's deal with the Mariners can max out in the mid-$50 million range, sources told Passan.</p>
      <p>MLB.com was the first to report White's agreement with the Mariners.</p>
      <p>Barring a disastrous spring training, White is expected to be Seattle's first baseman on Opening Day. The Mariners used eight different players at the position last season, with <a href="http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32961/austin-nola">Austin Nola</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32851/daniel-vogelbach">Daniel Vogelbach</a> getting most of the playing time there.</p>
      <p>The Mariners see White as a major part of their future core, along with fellow top prospects <a href="http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41150">Jarred Kelenic</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/36188/kyle-lewis">Kyle Lewis</a>, <a href="http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/41221/logan-gilbert">Logan Gilbert</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/40992/justin-dunn">Justin Dunn</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33815/justus-sheffield">Justus Sheffield</a>.</p>
      <p>A non-roster invitee to spring training last year, White had a .293 batting average with 18 home runs and 55 RBIs in 92 games while being named to the Futures Game last season.</p>
      <p>White, the 17th overall pick in the 2017 draft out of Kentucky, also was a Double-A All-Star selection by Baseball America.</p>
      <p>In three minor league seasons, White has a .296 batting average with 32 home runs and 133 RBIs.</p>
