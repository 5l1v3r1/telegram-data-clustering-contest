      <h1>Resident Evil 3 Remake is Reportedly in Development</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:45:41+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>Capcom is reportedly hoping to follow up on the success of its <i>Resident Evil 2</i> remake with a new version of <i>Resident Evil 3</i>. In a video published yesterday youtuber SpawnWave said that the game is already in active development, and is slated for a launch next year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-22-sources-resident-evil-3-remake-in-development">Eurogamer</a> and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/resident-evil-3-remake-to-release-in-2020/">VGC</a> both corroborate claims that the new game is currently being worked on, but state that the multiplayer <i>Project Resistance</i> - which was announced in September - is receiving more attention from Capcom.</p>

      <p>Another remake isn't too surprising. Capcom has previously suggested that if <i>Resident Evil 2</i> was a financial success, it would look into remaking more of its back catalogue.  Given that <i>Resi 2</i> has sold nearly five million copies, the existence of more remakes isn't a huge shock. What's more unexpected is that Capcom is targeting such a short turnaround - <i>Resi 2</i> only launched at the beginning of this year (there are also questions to be asked about <i>Resi 3</i> being chosen over <i>Resi 4</i>, but I'll let those slide for now).</p>
