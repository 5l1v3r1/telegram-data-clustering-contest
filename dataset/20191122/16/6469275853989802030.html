      <p>Christine Clarke, 51, from Chorley, was last seen at 5.30am on Saturday, November 9 on the A6 near Frederick’s Ice Cream.</p>
      <p>Christine’s body was recovered from the Leeds and Liverpool Canal close the Frederick’s the next day.</p>
      <p>Her death is being treated as unexplained, but is not believed to be suspicious.</p>
      <p>A police spokesman said: "Further to our earlier appeal, a missing coat belonging to Christine Clarke has been handed into police.</p>
      <p>"Following extensive searches officers sadly recovered her body from the Leeds Liverpool Canal close to Frederick’s on November 10.</p>
      <p>"Police were contacted on November 9 by a member of the public who confirmed they had recovered a coat and rucksack from the canal.</p>
      <p>"They placed the items by the canal side, but when officers attended the scene, the coat, an extra small black ‘Superdry’ parka style coat with a fur-style hood, was missing.</p>
      <p>"The coat belonged to Christine and her family had appealed for it to be returned.</p>
      <p>"A member of the public handed the coat to police this week, with the coat passed to Christine's family today (Friday, November 22).</p>
      <p>"Thanks to everyone who shared our earlier appeal to find it."</p>
