      <p>PlayStation has kicked off its Black Friday sale, which runs until 2nd December, and there are some pretty decent deals in there for all you PlayStation 4 owners. As well as a couple of cracking PlayStation exclusives from the past couple of years getting discounts, like <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-CUSA11995_00-MARVELSSPIDERMAN?smcid=psblog%3Aen%3APlayStationStoresBlackFridayDiscountsStartTodaySaveOnGamesPSPlusAndMovies%3A%3AMarvel%27s%20Spider-Man">Marvel’s Spider-Man</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-CUSA10213_00-HRZCE00000000000">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, there are plenty of savings on some great games from this year too.</p>
      <p>The PSVR hasn’t had an avalanche of hits since its launch back in 2016, but there was definitely one this year that caught the attention of many: <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/03/blood-truth-review/">Blood &amp; Truth</a>. The virtual reality shooter is available on the PS Store right now for only £15.99, and well worth your money if you’ve got the PlayStation goggles. Plus Colin Salmon is in it, and who doesn’t love a bit of Salmon from time to time?</p>
      <p>The Bandicoot-fronted kart racer from 20 years ago reminded us just how good it was with a beautiful remake back in June. <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/21/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-review/">Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled</a> is currently available on the PlayStation Store for only £22.74, and you would be really silly to not grab it. This isn’t nostalgia talking: CTR is a quality racing game.</p>
      <p>One of 2019’s biggest surprises, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/07/11/dragon-quest-builders-2-review/">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a>, is a third off its regular price at the minute. You can play the game Kirk called a “masterpiece” when he reviewed it back in July for a mere £33.49. Get on it. Get on all of them, frankly. Here’s a few standouts that we found when looking through the PlayStation Store Black Friday sale.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP1001-CUSA08025_00-000000000OAKSIEE">Borderlands 3 for £34.99</a>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can grab a couple of PlayStation-related items at cut price on basically every website that’s trying to sell you stuff at the minute.
