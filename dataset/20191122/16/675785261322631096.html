      <h1>Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho's five best ever press conference moments</h1>
      <h2>Mourinho is not afraid of speaking his mind - over the years his brutal honesty has led to some truly iconic moments</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Cooper, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/joe-cooper/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> made a sensational return to the Premier League on Wednesday morning, replacing the sacked Mauricio Pochettino at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Spurs</a>.</p>
      <p>Mourinho, who has managed in the Premier League on three previous occasions, is no stranger to controversy and fans will be expecting more of the same as he returns for a fourth stint.</p>
      <p>Over the years the self-proclaimed 'Special One' has used press conferences as a stage to air his views, frustrations and at times, digs at managerial rivals.</p>
      <p>There have been countless examples over the years and - barring a dramatic change of personality and temperament - one can expect plenty more to come as Mourinho takes the reins at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a>.</p>

      <h3>1. A dig at Arsenal and Arsene Wenger</h3>
      <p>Wenger versus Mourinho is one of the great historical Premier League rivalries, with numerous clashes throughout the years.</p>
      <p>On this particular occasion, Mourinho took the press to criticise Wenger's reaction to a defeat.</p>
      <p>"I played against arsenal 12,15, 18 times and only once he [Wenger] didn't moan," said Mourinho.</p>
      <p>"On that day, we lost the game, we lost the cup. It was not good for us, we behave in aÂ  fantastic way, no excuses, not crying or moaning."</p>

      <h3>2. Mourinho demands respect</h3>
      <p>Towards the end of his stint at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a>, when the wheels had really started to come off, Mourinho took it upon himself to remind reporters of who they were dealing with.</p>
      <p>"Three Premierships and I won more Premierships alone than the other 19 [Premier League] managers together," he exclaimed, holding up three fingers.</p>
      <p>"Three for me and two for them. Respect, respect man, respect, respect," he continued, as he stormed out of the press conference.</p>

      <h3>3. The 'Special One'</h3>
      <p>Mourinho didn't hang about when he first came on to the Premier League scene.</p>
      <p>His first ever press conference as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> manager has down down in history, all thanks to one special quote, which went something like:</p>
      <p>"Please don't call me arrogant because what I'm saying is true. I'm European champion - I think I'm a special one."</p>

      <h3>4. Specialist in Failure</h3>
      <p>Mourinho might be the 'Special One', but what did he think of rival Arsene Wenger?</p>
      <p>Well, one particularly scathing quote tells you all you need to know:</p>
      <p>"You know, he [Wenger] is a specialist in failure. I'm not. So if he is right and I'm afraid of failure it's because I don't fail many times."</p>

      <h3>5. Third season syndrome</h3>
      <p>Mourinho may have found success everywhere he has been, but he still has detractors who often focus on his lack of longevity at clubs.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese boss is often seen to have imploded in his third season at a club. But if you ask him about it, make sure you do it sensitively:</p>
      <p>"My third season in Porto? I did not have a third season. My third season in Inter? I did not have a third season.</p>

      <p>"My third season at Chelsea for the first time, I won the FA Cup, the Carling Cup and I played the Champions League semi-finals.</p>
      <p>"The third season in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> I won the Super Cup, I lost the cup final and I went to the Champions League semi-finals. These are my third seasons."</p>
