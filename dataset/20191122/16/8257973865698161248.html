      <p>Nov. 22 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/John_Legend/?tps=1">John Legend</a> says he was prepared for the "good and bad" of being named People's Sexiest Man Alive.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old singer discussed the title and his friendship with country music star <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Blake_Shelton/?tps=1">Blake Shelton</a> during Friday's <a href="https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/1197867292803108871">episode</a> of <i>Today</i>.</p>
      <p>Legend said he was "excited" but a little apprehensive about Sexiest Man Alive.</p>
      <p>"You prepare for the good and bad of it. Whenever they announce these things, social media goes crazy," he said.</p>
      <p>Legend's wife, model and television personality <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Chrissy_Teigen/?tps=1">Chrissy Teigen</a>, has more than 38 million followers on Twitter and Instagram.</p>
      <p>Shelton, People's Sexiest Man Alive in 2017, <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/11/13/John-Legend-is-Peoples-2019-Sexiest-Man-Alive/6591573645967/">announced Legend</a> as the 2019 honoree on <i>The Voice </i>this month. Legend, who is a coach with Shelton on<i> The Voice</i>, said Shelton gave him advice.</p>
      <p>"Blake told me to avoid social media, and I tried," he said. "I avoided it for a while, but then <i>The Voice</i> was on and I wanted to see what people thought of my singers."</p>
      <p>Legend also <a href="https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/1197867436495843328">explained</a> the meaning behind the "VEGOTSMA" shorts Shelton recently presented him with on <i>The Voice</i>.</p>
      <p>"VEGOTSMA, it's a very convoluted acronym," he said. "V is for winning <i>The Voice</i>, which I just did in Season 16. E, Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony, so that's the EGOT. And then SMA, Sexiest Man Alive."</p>
