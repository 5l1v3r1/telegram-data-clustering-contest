      <p>John Bolton is back... on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The former national security adviser was apparently locked out of his government-tied account after what he claims was his resignation from the White House and what President Trump says was his firing. But as of Friday morning, he's back online and typing as many ellipses as his heart desires.</p>
      <p>Bolton surprised the world (or at least a few people) Friday when he tweeted that he was back on Twitter and that everyone should "stay tuned" for some kind of backstory. It's unclear if that's the backstory to his firing or just how he got kicked off social media — the former of which would be relevant to impeachment investigators, who he was <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/877551/john-bolton-seemingly-doesnt-want-house-impeachment-investigators-give-just">recently reported</a> to be willing to testify for.</p>

      <p>Then, because his two-month vacation from the internet seemingly led him to forget how to use it, Bolton retweeted himself, and then sent a more dramatic version of his first message about two and a half hours later.</p>

      <p>Bolton, however, did not and still does not need any online liberation to speak with the House in its ongoing investigation of Trump's dealing with Ukraine.</p>
