      <p>Apple has announced that new server-to-server notifications for App Store subscriptions are now available to developers.<br/><br/><i>Server-to-server notifications from the App Store let you receive real-time updates in a subscriptionâ€™s status, so you can provide customized experiences for your subscribers. New notifications are now available when a subscription renewal fails due to a billing issue and when a billing issue is resolved by the App Store. In addition, a unified receipt containing information about the latest 100 in-app purchase transactions is now included with the notification. </i><br/><br/>If you've already enabled server-to-server notifications in App Store Connect, you'll automatically receive the new notifications and unified receipt for these subscription events. You can learn how to enable server-to-server notifications at the link below.<br/><br/><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreservernotifications/">Read More</a></p>
