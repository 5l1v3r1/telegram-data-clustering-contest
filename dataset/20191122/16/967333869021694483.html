      <p>In a bizarre incident at least seven people have been booked by police in the Indian state of<a href="https://sputniknews.com/interviews/201909301076927444-indias-flood-hit-bihar-state-facing-medical-emergency---disaster-response-force-chief/"> Bihar</a> after a woman’s rooster was found dead following her quarrel with neighbours.</p>
      <p>According to the police, Kamla Devi, a resident of a remote village in Bihar, had a dispute with her neighbour.</p>
      <blockquote>“Following the long happening dispute, the two parties fought again over a matter two days ago. During the scuffle, the neighbour snatched Kamala Devi's <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201905261075348176-indian-worker-raping-cows-animal-shelter-animal-cruelty-charges/">pet rooster and killed it",</a> a senior police officer said.</blockquote>
      <p>A post-mortem of the rooster at a local veterinary hospital revealed, it had been killed with a sharp object.</p>
      <blockquote>“As per the post-mortem reports, use of blade on the rooster's neck was confirmed. A first information report was lodged for the murder of a rooster under section 429 (Mischief by <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201908211076603978-youtube-bans-fighting-robot-videos-over-claims-of-animal-cruelty/">killing or maiming cattle</a>, etc.), 341 (Punishment for wrongful restrain) and 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code against seven people", the officer added.</blockquote>
      <p>A further investigation is underway.</p>
