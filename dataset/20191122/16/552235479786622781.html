      <p>Funding targeted at bridging the poverty attainment gap has led to a range of successful initiatives being delivered in schools across West Dunbartonshire.</p>
      <p>But the pupil equity funding is set to come to an end in March with uncertainty over the continuation of projects organised as part of the scheme.</p>
      <p>Each school is given an allocation based on the number of pupils on the roll eligible for free school meals.</p>

      <p>And many schools within the region have dedicated the cash to science, technology, engineering and maths projects and other initiatives to involve the school community in their work.</p>
      <p>A West Dunbartonshire Council spokeswoman said: “Our schools have successfully delivered a range of initiatives to support pupils to raise attainment. The number and range of projects is dependent on the funding allocation to each school and the costs associated with delivering activities.</p>
      <p>"Headteachers are empowered to use the funding for initiatives which best meet the specific needs of their pupils and these include projects to drive literacy and numeracy, health and wellbeing and family engagement.”</p>
