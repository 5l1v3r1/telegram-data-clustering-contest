      <h1>President Trump on Senate Impeachment Trial: Bring It On</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://townhall.com/author/katiepavlich" target="_blank">Katie Pavlich</a></address>
      <p>During an interview with Fox and Friends Friday morning, President Trump said if articles of impeachment pass the House, he wants a full, open and transparent trial in the Senate. He also said he wants the "whistleblower," who filed a second hand complaint to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, to testify.</p>
      <p>"Frankly, I want a trial," Trump said. "They’ve looked like fools over the last five days."</p>
      <p>"There's nothing there," he continued. “There’s only one person I want more than where’s Hunter and that is Adam Schiff...I want to see Adam Schiff testify about the whistleblower...the whistleblower in my opinion is a political operative just like his lawyer...the one I want to testify the most is shifty Schiff."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, who would lead the Senate trial, has <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2019/11/21/senator-graham-asks-the-state-department-of-documents-on-hunter-biden-burisma-n2556890">opened up an investigation</a> into the Bidens and Burisma. He's also said he won't allow a trial to proceed without testimony from the whistleblower. </p>
