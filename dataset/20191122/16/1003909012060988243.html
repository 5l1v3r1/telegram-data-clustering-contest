      <h1>Growing options coming available in Calgary area's multi-family market</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:27:04+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:27</time> by <a rel="author">Joel Schlesinger, for the Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Developers and builders turned their sights largely on Calgary’s rental market last month with starts driven by the purpose-built multi-family rental segment.</p>
      <p>The latest data on starts in the city, compiled by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., jumped nearly 20 per cent  in October over the same month last year, says Heather Boyer, senior analyst for economics at CMHC, which collects the data.</p>
      <p>“And the increase in starts in October was largely driven in the rental side of the market.”</p>
      <p>She adds this points to builders and developers adjusting to the current over-supply conditions in the apartment condominium side of the market.</p>
      <p>Single-family homes also increased, but only by just three per cent compared with the same month in 2018. By contrast, other housing types — made up mostly of multi-family — grew by 30 per cent.</p>
      <p>“We are still seeing overbuilding in the new home market, particularly among condominiums, but we when look at the rental market, we are seeing low over-building, so this is again why we’re seeing a boost to rental construction in Calgary,” she says.</p>
      <p>Year to date, however, numbers are actually down overall for multi-family types, she says.</p>
      <p>Multi-family starts were down five per cent while single-family detached homes decreased 17 per cent from January to the end of October compared with the same span last year.</p>
      <p>Still, as CMHC’s Fall Housing Market Update, released earlier this month, noted Calgary is experiencing moderate overbuilding that will continue for the rest of the year into next, she says.</p>
      <p>Given inventories remain high for new homes, Boyer says the market should continue to see more multi-family rental starts.</p>
      <p>Calgary realtor Joel Gwillim with CIR Realty says already many of the new builds downtown are rental properties.</p>
      <p>“There are buildings going up, but there aren’t actually that many for sale, which I think is going to help in the long run.”</p>
      <p>Gwillim adds this change in focus should help reduce supply over time on the condominium side downtown.</p>
      <p>But more rental units will also put “pressure on the investors” seeking to buy condominiums to rent out.</p>
      <p>“Now you’re facing a lot of competition from rental-only buildings that can undercut you based on the fact they’re dealing in multiple units, not like one or two if you’re a private investor.”</p>
      <p>For buyers seeking the condominium lifestyle, however, they have likely never seen better conditions regarding choice and pricing, he says.</p>
      <p>Gwillim further adds developers may be less flexible on pricing for new builds than condo sellers on the resale market. Yet many builders are offering “sweeteners” like a free year of condominium fees or gift cards to help furnish units.</p>
      <p>On the resale side, too, deals can be found on newer product. Gwillim notes condominiums he pre-sold before the downturn in energy prices in late 2014 are now selling 20 to 30 per cent below their original price — albeit these units are more limited in choice.</p>
      <p>“So you can still get something that’s fairly new; maybe one owner has lived in there, and it’s two or three years old,” Gwillim says. “The pricing is night and day to what it was, so the value you’re getting is incredible.”</p>
