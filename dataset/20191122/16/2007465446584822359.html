      <h1>Check out hydrogen-powered Mirai at Toyota HEV Drive Expo</h1>
      <h2>The Toyota Mirai arrives in the Philippines for the very first time</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:17:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/jose-altoveros.html" target="_blank">Jose Altoveros</a></address>
      <p>For the very first time, the hydrogen fuel-cell-powered Mirai finally makes its way to the Philippines. Better yet, you can even get up close and personal with it at Toyota Motor Philippines’ Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) Drive Expo happening at the Greenbelt 5 Fashion Walk this November 22 until November 24, 2019.</p>

      <p>Unlike TMP’s current hybrid offerings in the Philippine market, the Mirai uses Toyota’s hydrogen fuel cell technology to drive an electric motor. It has a total power output of 153 horsepower and has a maximum range of about 500 kilometers. Similar to a hybrid vehicle, it still needs to be “refueled”. However, the Mirai “gasses up” at hydrogen filling stations rather than gasoline stations.</p>

      <p>Wondering how all of that works? TMP also brought in a cross section model of the Mirai to give visitors a better understanding of how the hydrogen fuel-cell technology works.</p>

      <p>Keen-eyed readers would have noticed that the Mirai on display is in right-hand drive configuration. The reason behind this is because TMP has no plans of introducing the hydrogen-powered vehicle in the country. Well, not yet at least. The main reason is due to the lack of infrastructure for hydrogen-powered vehicles. Simply put, there are no hydrogen refueling stations in the country.</p>

      <p>Aside from the Mirai, TMP has hybrid vehicles on display at the HEV Drive Expo as well including the Prius, Prius C, and the newly introduced Corolla Altis Hybrid. They are displayed together with Lexus Manila’s lineup of hybrid vehicles which are composed of the NX 300h, LS 500h, and the RX450h.</p>

      <p>Though the Mirai may not be arriving in the Philippines anytime soon, it goes to show Toyota is serious about their commitment to sustainable and eco-friendly mobility. </p>
