      <h4>A Middle East-based consortium claims it was quoted £2.5bn but Russian oligarch's associates say he has now lost interest any sale of club, but what does it all mean for Chelsea?</h4>
      <h3>Was there serious interest in Chelsea?</h3>
      <p>Representatives for Roman Abramovich are known to have had contact with at least three billionaire investors, despite the club insisting it has never been for sale. </p>
      <p>Costs and complications surrounding a potential redevelopment of Stamford Bridge have put off at least two potential bidders. The Middle East consortium, who spoke to<i> Telegraph Sport</i>, estimated costs at £1.2 billion, and said preparations could take years to resolve with Chelsea Pitch Owners Ltd. Meanwhile, Bob Ratcliffe, the brother of Sir Jim Ratcliffe, previously told the BBC fears over redeveloping the stadium proved <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/08/31/chelsea-season-ticket-holder-britains-wealthiest-man-hints-expanding/">too big to overcome for a potential takeover by petrochemicals giant Ineos</a>.</p>
      <h3>Does this mean Abramovich will return to the UK?</h3>
      <p>Sources close to the Russian say there have been no discussions with the British Government, and he is happy to run Chelsea from Russia and Israel, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/10/23/roman-abramovich-exile-activism-yoga-superyacht-filled-void/">where he  has taken citizenship</a>. He could travel to the UK on his Israeli passport, but remains sore at his treatment by European nations, having also withdrew a bid for Swiss residency in 2016 before it emerged federal police had advised he posed a "threat to public security and a reputational risk".</p>
      <p>Abramovich is now among four formerly British-based Russian oligarchs lying low, with little hope of fresh invites from the UK after the general election or Brexit. Last December's Home Office immigration white paper outlines  that tier-one applications post-Brexit will not become more welcoming. "<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/04/16/chelsea-will-remain-club-limbo-roman-abramovich-decides-whether/">His absence is largely self-imposed</a> because he is still seething," one former friend said. "He believes he has done as much as anyone to make the Premier League what it is today and has been good for UK PLC."</p>
      <h3>Will plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge be reactivated?</h3>
      <p>Club executives remain hopeful that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/08/28/chelsea-investment-could-thaw-stamford-bridge-redevelopment/">the "paused" Stamford Bridge redevelopment </a>could be back on the agenda within months. Mark Thompson, of sports sponsorship firm Kore, believes the immediate returns in stadium naming rights and increased revenue make the ongoing delays nonsensical. "I'm sure he will be keen to progress development," he said. However, the economic reasons that Abramovich cited as his reasons to postpone redevelopment have not changed, with London's property market stagnating in the 18 months since the planned £1bn redevelopment was shelved.</p>
      <h3>Can we expect more big transfer spending once Chelsea's ban is complete?</h3>
      <p>Frank Lampard is already considering how he eventually plans to spend Chelsea’s £150 million transfer kitty. Chelsea are fighting to have their transfer embargo overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), and will learn their fate next month. With one window already served that means Chelsea could be allowed to sign players in time for the January transfer window if Cas cut their punishment.</p>
      <p>Chelsea are looking at strikers and wide players. Lyon striker Moussa Dembélé and Crystal Palace and Borussia Dortmund wingers Wilfried Zaha and Jadon Sancho are among the players Chelsea are interested in. Chelsea are also following Leicester City left-back Ben Chilwell, who is unlikely to be available in January, and Bournemouth central defender Nathan Aké who they can buy back for £40m.</p>
