      <h1>Republic of Ireland fans must wait until Christmas to discover Slovakia Euro playoff venue</h1>

        <b>The Republic of Ireland will need to win two games on the road if they're to reach the finals of Euro 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy's side will travel to Slovakia in the play-off semi-finals on March 26th next.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the FAI says the semi-final will be played in Bratislava, but will have to wait until December 20th for confirmation.</p>
      <p>Slovakia have played recent home qualifiers in Trnava while the 22,500 capacity Tehelné pole stadium in the capital was being renovated.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson added, "they [Slovakia] have some final checks to make on the ground there before they can confirm it as the venue.</p>

      <p>"We have also opened talks with them on the allocation of tickets and will update our fans as soon as we can. We are guaranteed 5% of the tickets but we are negotiating for more.</p>
      <p>"Tickets will be allocated to supporters based on away attendance records from the last two campaigns. We will announce the application process as soon as we know our allocation."</p>
      <p>Should Ireland win in Bratislava they'll be away to either Northern Ireland or Bosnia/Herzegovina in a one-leg play-off final on March 31st for a place at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>McCarthy is upbeat about Ireland's hopes, "If we win the first game against Slovakia then I will fancy our chances anywhere else.</p>
      <p>"We will have our analysis done on all three teams but our focus is on Slovakia first and getting ready for them in the New Year.</p>
      <p>"We know what we have to do, we have to go there and win the game.</p>
      <p>"Home advantage is just that but if we play as well as we did against Denmark then I will settle for that.</p>
      <p>"We set the bar high on Monday night and that is the standard we will have to play at to win two games."</p>
