      <p><b>LOS ANGELES —</b> The big reveal of Tesla's electric pick-up went embarrassingly wrong when the supposedly impact-proof windows smashed, leaving a flustered Elon Musk to flounder through the rest of his presentation in front of a badly damaged vehicle.<br/><br/>The Tesla co-founder unveiled the all-electric battery-powered Tesla Cybertruck in California on Thursday, daring staff to hit the vehicle with sledgehammers and showing a video of it withstanding bullets shot from a 9mm gun.<br/><br/>But the demonstration of the vehicle's indestructible windows didn't appear to go entirely to plan after one assistant threw a steel ball bearing at the truck — only to see the armored glass smash.<br/><br/>An expletive could be heard at the Tesla Design Center and as his assistant laughed nervously, Musk said: "Well, maybe that was a little too hard."<br/><br/>A second attempt fared little better however, and another window was left badly damaged.<br/><br/>"It didn't go through," said a clearly uncomfortable Musk, who was forced to push on through the remainder of the chaotic launch with the two smashed windows in full view.<br/><br/>The industrial-looking Cybertruck is covered in the same steel alloy Musk plans to use for his SpaceX rocket and will be able to go from 0 to 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour in about three seconds, the Tesla chief executive claimed.<br/><br/>He said the entry-level model will have a starting price of $39,900 and a 400-kilometer (250-mile) range, while a deluxe option will be able to travel twice the distance and will sell for $69,900.<br/><br/>No date has been given for its release but analysts said it would not be ready before the end of 2021 at the earliest.<br/><br/>Tesla dominates the global electric car market and has an especially firm grip on the United States, where pick-ups are particularly popular.<br/><br/>The California-based firm is hoping to edge in on domestic demand for larger car types such as pick-ups and sports utility vehicles, the margins for which have allowed manufacturers to cope with rising steel and aluminum costs.<br/><br/>A lack of models in the pick-up class left "plenty of room for growth and for automakers to carve out new niches", said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of automotive website Edmunds.<br/><br/>Caldwell suggested before the Cybertruck was unveiled that its design was likely to be "somewhat polarizing."<br/><br/>"Tesla's built its brand around striking design and doing things differently, so they can't just trot out a truck that looks like a version of something else," she said.<br/><br/>Musk said the vehicle's design had been inspired by the "cyberpunk" science fiction genre, including director Ridley Scott's classic 1982 film "Blade Runner."<br/><br/>He had promised before the launch that Tesla's latest offering would cost less than $50,000 — the average US price for pick-up vehicles — and that it would outperform the Ford F-150, the country's top-selling vehicle in the class. — AFP</p>
