      <h1>Auburn vs. Samford: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:48:38+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Before the No. 15 Auburn Tigers take the field for the annual Iron Bowl against the Alabama Crimson Tide, they’ll have to take care of business this weekend as they’re set to host the Samford Bulldogs.</p>
      <p>Despite making a comeback late in the fourth quarter last weekend, Auburn still fell short to Georgia. Outside of Bo Nix making plays with his arm or legs, the offense <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/auburn-tigers/auburn-fans-reaction-bo-nix-incomplete-georgia">didn’t have much life</a>.</p>
      <p>The Tigers should easily defeat the Bulldogs this Saturday at home as they own a 27-0-1 all-time record against the Southern Conference program.</p>
      <p>Samford snapped its losing streak with a victory over Western Carolina in Week 12. Nonetheless, the odds are greatly stacked against the Bulldogs this weekend.</p>

      <p>Here are the details for the Auburn-Samford game:</p>
      <p><b>Game Time: </b>12:00 p.m. ET</p>
      <p><b>Channel: </b>SEC Network</p>
      <p>
        <b>Spread: </b>

      </p>
      <p><b>Over/Under: </b>64</p>
      <p><b>Announcers: </b>Taylor Zarzour, Matt Stinchcomb</p>
      <p>With the Iron Bowl almost a week away, the Tigers will have a solid opportunity to fix any lingering issues on offense this Saturday.</p>
      <p>Guz Malzahn needs to revitalize his rushing attack with D.J. Williams and JaTarvious Whitlow. If Auburn doesn’t have a stable running game next weekend against Alabama, the chances of an upset happening at Jordan-Hare Stadium will be slim.</p>
      <p>Do you think Auburn bounces back this weekend with a dominant win over Samford?</p>
