      <p>Nobody will be prosecuted over the death of a 13-year-old girl found hanged close to her home following a family argument.</p>
      <p>Amber Peat’s body was found in bushes three days after she went missing in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, after a row with her mother over household chores.</p>
      <p>An inquest into her death heard her parents, Kelly and Danny Peat, ‘lacked emotional warmth’ towards her and were ‘not concerned in the slightest’ when she left home on May 30, 2015.</p>
      <p>Despite her history of running away Mrs Peat only called police to report her missing eight hours after she vanished, shortly before 1am the following morning.</p>
      <p>The coroner also slammed safeguarding agencies who missed 11 opportunities to step in and possibly prevent her eventual death.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that there was ‘insufficient evidence’ to charge anyone in connection with the case.</p>

      <p>During the inquest it emerged Amber had told her teachers she had to ‘scrub the floor’ until the early hours and that her stepfather had forced her to wear a ‘ridiculous’ outfit to school to humiliate her.</p>

      <p>The court heard Amber’s parents went shopping and had the family car washed while she was missing, leaving her with no way of getting back in the house should she come back.</p>
      <p>Assistant coroner Laurinda Bower also concluded that a lack of consideration for Amber’s welfare was a ‘theme’ throughout the events leading up to her death.</p>
      <p>She added that there was ‘corroborative evidence of the lack of attention that Mrs Peat paid towards her daughter’s feelings such as the lack of emotion when Amber went missing’.</p>

      <p>A serious case review, commissioned by Nottinghamshire Safeguarding Children Board, suggested the teenager believed ‘she was to blame for many of the difficulties within the family’, while a lack of planning led to gaps in the care she received.</p>
      <p>Despite discussing her problems with two of her previous schools as well as with a youth worker, practitioners admitted their understanding of Amber’s life was very limited.</p>
      <p>The review suggested the family frequently moving house, a lack of recording in primary schools, a failure in following policies and procedures, and a weakness in sharing information led to the breakdown in communication between different agencies.</p>
      <p>Ms Bower said she considered concluding Amber died as a result of suicide, but said she could not be certain what her intention was at the time.</p>

      <p>A CPS spokesman said: ‘Following the inquest into the tragic death of Amber Peat, we have reviewed the case once more in light of the coroner’s findings and further material gathered by Nottinghamshire Police.</p>
      <p>‘After careful consideration of all the available evidence, we have concluded there is insufficient evidence to prosecute anyone for criminal offences relating to Amber’s treatment up to the time of her death.</p>
      <p>‘Amber’s relatives have been updated about the decision. Our thoughts remain with them.’</p>
