      <p>BAYSWATER Primary School will be going back to the future as part of its 125th anniversary celebrations.</p>
      <p>The school’s P&amp;C is holding a Back to the Future themed fete on November 24 from 10am to 3pm.</p>
      <p>The fete will include a historical dress-up and photo booth, sideshow alley, old fashion games and a blender bike.</p>
      <p>The City of Bayswater, Metronet, Bayswater Historical Society and Bayswater Men’s Shed will also be holding stalls.</p>
      <p>Former student and father Nathan Setzinger, who was in the class of 1983, said it was a lovely connection to have his daughter Edith attend the school.</p>
      <p>“There are more classrooms, there is a new art block, the buildings have changed and there is a new library,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The format has changed a bit.</p>
      <p>“My classroom used to be one big and long classroom and now it is split into two.”</p>
      <p>Mr Setzinger, now a teacher at Cecil Andrews College, said playing marbles, getting into trouble and being with the principal in the quadrangle were among his childhood memories.</p>
