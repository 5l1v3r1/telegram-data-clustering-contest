      <p>Speaking of their wedding anniversary celebrations, the duo has decided to keep it a low-key affair and have headed to Japan for a three-day-trip. A source close to the actress informs that she had been working continuously to keep her schedules free later. Opening up about her anniversary, Shilpa said, “Our journey so far has been beautiful and I have loved every part of it. These 10 years have definitely been very memorable and while a decade is a milestone for any marriage, I wanted a break from work and keep the celebrations modest. A trip to Japan was Raj's idea.”</p>
      <p>Here’s wishing Shilpa and Raj a very happy wedding anniversary. Meanwhile, on the work front,  she will be next seen in Nikamma which is currently on floors. We are quite excited to see Shilpa on the big screen once again, what about you?</p>
