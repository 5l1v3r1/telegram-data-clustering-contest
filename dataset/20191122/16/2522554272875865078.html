      <p>"My house was $3.7 million. Then I put about $600,000 into it. That's the most I've ever spent, but I look at it as a good investment. At the end of the day, that shit already went up in value. It could be there for the kids. I don't feel like I'm playing myself no more. Just paying rent was never feeling good anyways."</p>
      <p>"Other than that, trips. Hawaii trips. I bring homies with me. I usually go like five to seven deep. It'll cost sometimes if I go on a trip. Sometimes it's around $80,000 to $100,000. Spend 100 racks on a trip, that's something you can never lose. Your watch can get taken from you, your chain can get taken, you can go to jail and they can take your home, but memories are forever."</p>

      <p>But I’d say me, my brother and my uncle. A strip club [in] Miami. $60,000. Every stripper in the club. I didn’t pay for that, though, but it was a lot of my family [<i>laughs</i>].”</p>
