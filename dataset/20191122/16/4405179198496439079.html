      <p>Black Friday officially arrives next week, on 29 November, but Amazon and Currys PC World have both launched its Black Friday sales on 22 November. One deal that caught our eye is £100 off the 64GB 10.5in iPad Pro (2017) with Wi-Fi. You can pick up this discount on the iPad Pro from both <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-iPad-10-5-inch-Wi-Fi-Cellular/dp/B071GD39Q1?ascsubtag=41-3778417-11-0000000">Amazon</a> or <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=41-3778417-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fcomputing%2Ftablets-and-ereaders%2Ftablets%2Fapple-10-5-ipad-pro-2017-64-gb-gold-10165842-pdt.html">Currys</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Update: the 64GB model is now out of stock at both Currys and Amazon, but you can still get around £150 off the 256GB and 512GB models (see table below). Amazon has the 64GB option returning to stock on 25 November if you're willing to wait.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Though the 2017 model was discontinued in March 2019, its RRPs did not receive any price cuts, which were as follow on the Wi-Fi models: 64GB at £619, 256GB at £709, and the 512GB at £889.</p>
