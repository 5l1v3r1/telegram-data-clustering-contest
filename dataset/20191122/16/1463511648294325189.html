      <p>Wole Oke, the Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Public Accounts, has commended Adeniyi Adebayo, Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment.</p>
      <p>Oke gave the commendation a committee roundtable on Friday in Abuja, saying that Adebayo’s disposition to work with the parliament is for the overall development of the country.</p>
      <p>He said that the commendation was necessary because the minister did not only respond to invitation letter sent to him, but also made efforts to appear before the committee in person.</p>
      <p>According to the lawmaker, some ministers do not bother to come by giving excuses on why they would not appear before the parliament committee.</p>
      <p>Oke said: “Chief Accounting Officers of various ministries are required to appear before the public account committee, if and when required.”</p>
      <p>According to him, the country belongs to everybody, irrespective of whatever platform or background.</p>
      <p>He said that there must be synergy between the arms to ensure Nigeria progress for the benefit of all.</p>
      <p>Adebayo thanked members of the committee for welcoming him and for their willingness to work with the ministry to develop the economy.</p>
      <p>The minister promised to ensure a seamless working relationship between the ministry and the National Assembly.</p>
