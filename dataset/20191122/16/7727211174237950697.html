      <h1>Tranmere Rovers boss Micky Mellon sends message ahead of Fleetwood Town clash</h1>
      <h2>Tranmere Rovers take on Fleetwood Town in League One this weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:24:25+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:24</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Beattie</a></address>
      <p>Tranmere Rovers manager Micky Mellon feels his side’s incredible FA Cup first round victory can spur the club on against Fleetwood Town.</p>
      <p>Rovers overcame league leaders Wycombe Wanderers on Wednesday with a <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/micky-mellons-half-time-message-17295195">2-1 extra time win despite being reduced to 10 men.</a></p>
      <p>Mellon said: “We had to show great character, [just as] Wycombe had to do when they came to Prenton Park. It was a sort of role reversal.</p>
      <p>"When the questions got asked the players answered. So it was really pleasing.</p>
      <p>“We’re trying to keep things moving forward and as a club [the result] will certainly do no harm.”</p>

      <p>This weekend’s opponents Fleetwood are currently 8th in League One but have the advantage of games in hand on the sides above them.</p>
      <p>The Fylde Coast outfit’s boss Joey Barton has called for Mellon to receive a hero’s welcome ahead of his return to the club he led into the Football League for the first time in their history, winning the Conference National in 2011/12.</p>
      <p>However, the Rovers manager was quick to point out that sentiment will not enter his mind as he prepares to face his former employers.</p>
      <p>Mellon said: “It was a time in my managerial career that I made so many friends and had such an incredible time.</p>
      <p>"To have the moments we did as a team was fantastic and will stay with us forever.</p>
      <p>“But I’m with Tranmere now and it will be about making sure that my players are ready.”</p>
      <p>He added: “I respect the club that Fleetwood is and the great job that Joey [Barton] is doing. I know a lot of them there. There are still people there from my time there.</p>
      <p>“I’m an experienced manager and I think you have to keep your focus on the job at hand rather than get into competing against people.”</p>

      <p>Mellon insisted his preparation for this match will not differ despite his links with his old club.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s just the next game. We look at their strengths, we look at how we can nullify them. We look at areas maybe we can get them in.</p>
      <p>“I look forward to the challenge, absolutely."</p>
      <p>Despite the performance in midweek, Mellon acknowledged that the club are still developing and getting used to the intensity of League One following back-to-back promotions. And he was quick to keep expectations at realistic levels ahead of the clash against Fleetwood.</p>
      <p>Mellon said: “[Fleetwood] have been at this level longer than us so they’re a wee bit more experienced than us.</p>
      <p>“We’re growing as a group all the time. Always representing this fantastic club really well and [Saturday] will be no different.</p>
      <p>"So it should make for an interesting afternoon for all of us.”</p>
