      <p>Friday, President Donald Trump called into “Fox &amp; Friends” and took aim at White House counselor Kellyanne Conway’s husband, George Conway, who has been one of Trump’s most outspoken critics.</p>
      <p>Co-host Ainsley Earnhardt asked Trump about George Conway suggesting former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley is vying to be Trump’s running mate in 2020.</p>
      <p>Trump blasted Conway, calling him a “total wack job” and a “nutjob.”</p>
      <p>“Kellyanne is great, but she’s married to a total wack job,” Trump proclaimed. “I think she must’ve done some number on him, Ainsley. I don’t know what Kellyanne did to that guy because I don’t even know him. I met him for a second. He’s got to be some kind of a nutjob. She must have done some bad things to him because that guy is crazy.”</p>
