      <p>After expressing earlier this week that he <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/20/20974280/ufc-mma-news-interview-luke-rockhold-retirement-fight">wasn’t happy with fighting</a> at the moment, UFC light heavyweight Luke Rockhold has said he would consider a UFC return if they added a 195-pound weight class.</p>
      <p>Rockhold (16-5) was unsuccessful in his light heavyweight debut earlier this year at UFC 239, being knocked out by Jan Blachowicz in the second round. The former middleweight champion Rockhold, who now has four KO losses in his UFC career, has not fought since his most recent loss in July.</p>
      <p>Talking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX-RTzjByfM&amp;feature=youtu.be">Submission Radio</a>, Rockhold explained the struggles he had cutting to 185-pounds to reach the middleweight limit.</p>
      <p>“Weight issues, trying to make weight. For me, I feel like I’m killing myself to get down to 185, so I don’t see it,” he said. “That was my reasoning. More weight classes, add them in. Where’s that 195-weight division? Then maybe I think about coming back.”</p>
      <p>Despite his recent losses, Rockhold won the UFC middleweight title by handing Chris Weidman his first UFC loss back in 2015. Rockhold is set to test his grappling skills later this month when he faces <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/13/20962743/luke-rockhold-vs-nick-rodriguez-targeted-to-headline-polaris-12">Nick Rodriguez at Polaris 12</a>, but in regards to a return to fighting, Rockhold isn’t ruling it out for certain.</p>
      <p>“I’m 35 but I feel like I’m younger than most of these guys in their 20’s. So, I’m healthy and I’m just living my life,” he continued. “I’m gonna do what I do for now, and if it comes back at some point, so be it. And I don’t foresee that at this point. I’m pretty happy with what I’m doing, and I’m jumping into some other paths. There’s lots left to conquer.”</p>
