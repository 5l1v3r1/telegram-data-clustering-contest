      <h1>Google now offers nearly $2 million CAD prize for select Titan M exploits</h1>
      <h2>The new rewards come as part of an expanded Android Security Rewards program</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:23:57+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/jonathan-lamont" target="_blank">Jonathan Lamont</a></address>
      <p>Google is cranking up the top prize for its Android bug bounty program and offering $1 million USD (roughly $1.32 million CAD) to anyone who can compromise the Titan M security chip the search giant installs in its Pixel phones.</p>
      <p>The new top prize is for a “full chain remote code execution exploit with persistence” of the Titan M security chip. Plus, Google’s offering a 50 percent bonus if a researcher finds an exploit on specific developer preview versions of Android. In other words, the top potential prize is now $1.5 million USD (approximately $1.99 million CAD).</p>
      <p>Google first implemented the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/10/15/google-pixel-3-xl-review/">Titan M security chip with the Pixel 3</a>. The chip acts as a protected area for your smartphone’s most sensitive data that’s separate from the main processor, which helps protect it against certain attacks. For example, Google says <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/10/18/how-titan-m-secure-pixel-3/">Titan M handles on-device protection</a> for login credentials, disk encryption, app data and helps ensure the integrity of the operating system.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the chip integrates with <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/04/10/android-users-can-use-phones-security-key-added-protection-online/">Android’s security key functionality</a> and stores a person’s FIDO credentials.</p>
      <p>All this is to say that Titan M is a crucial part of Pixel devices’ security. It’s no surprise, then, that Google wants to make sure it’s secure.</p>
      <p>Along with the new Titan M rewards, Google also announced several new categories of exploits in the Android Security Rewards program. These offer prizes up to $500,000 USD (about $664,250 CAD). It includes exploits like data exfiltration and lock screen bypass.</p>
      <p>Android Security Rewards launched back in 2015 and over the last four years, Google paid out over $4 million USD (roughly $5.32 million CAD) in rewards. 2019 alone saw a total of $1.5 million USD in payouts, and Google awarded an average bounty of over $15,000 USD (or $19,932 CAD) per researcher. The largest single reward the company gave out this year was for $161,337 USD (about $214,384 CAD) for the first reported ‘one-click remote code execution exploit chain on the Pixel 3 device.’</p>
