        <li><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/jeffree-star">Jeffree Star</a> and <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/shane-dawson">Shane Dawson</a> launched their collaboration <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/makeup">makeup</a> line in early November.</li>
        <li>As customers receive their orders in the mail, some say their <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/eye-shadow">eye-shadow</a> palettes have arrived broken. Many of the allegedly damaged items appear to have been sent by Beauty Bay, a UK retailer that sells Jeffree Star Cosmetics.</li>
        <li>Some people also say they’ve found hair-like substances embedded in their eye shadow.</li>
        <li>While Star has yet to respond to most customer complaints surrounding these two issues, he did promise to send one customer a new palette.</li>

      <p>Some people aren’t thrilled with eye-shadow palettes from the Shane Dawson x Jeffree Star Cosmetics collaboration.</p>
      <p>The YouTubers launched their makeup line in early November, causing chaos both <a href="https://www.insider.com/jeffree-star-shane-dawson-makeup-sold-out-2019-11">online</a> and <a href="https://www.insider.com/jeffree-star-shane-dawson-makeup-where-to-buy-2019-11">in brick-and-mortar stores</a>. But as customers have started to receive the makeup they ordered, some say their Conspiracy eye-shadow palettes arrived broken in pieces. Others say they have found hair-like substances embedded in the products.</p>
      <p>Star has yet to address the apparent issues, leading more and more people to share their stories online.</p>
      <h3>Numerous people say their Conspiracy eye-shadow palettes arrived broken</h3>
      <p>On Twitter, people have shared photos and videos that show what their palettes looked like after opening them for the first time, with multiple people saying that the shade Sleep Paralysis arrived broken.</p>
      <p>Many of those who said they received broken palettes appear to have ordered the products from Beauty Bay, a UK retailer that sells Jeffree Star Cosmetics.</p>

      <h3>Some people also say they’ve found hair-like substances embedded in the eye shadow</h3>
      <p>While some people believe their palettes contain actual hair, others think the fibers could be string, glue, or fabric from gloves.</p>

      <p>One person later said the hair in her eye shadow was synthetic, and that Jeffree Star Cosmetics sent her a new palette we bought from <a href="https://www.insider.com/jeffree-star-shane-dawson-makeup-where-to-buy-2019-11">a Morphe store in New Jersey</a>.</p>

      <p>As seen in the fifth episode of Dawson’s YouTube series about the makeup line, eye shadows are <a href="https://youtu.be/9MoDGIkAudI">hand-pressed into each palette</a>. Factory workers also seem to use makeup brushes to sweep away excess powder.</p>

      <p>When Insider reviewed the Shane Dawson x Jeffree Star Cosmetics makeup line, we <a href="https://www.insider.com/jeffree-star-shane-dawson-makeup-review-2019-11">did not find any hair</a> or unwanted substances within the products.</p>
      <h3>Jeffree Star has responded to one customer who received a broken palette</h3>
      <p>While Star has yet to address the apparent issues surrounding his latest makeup launch, the beauty mogul did respond to one Twitter user who said they received a broken palette.</p>
      <p>“I’m so sorry how this situation was handled,” Star wrote on Twitter. “That does not reflect our company’s personal policies. We are handling this internally but in the meantime, please direct message me so I can send you a new palette right now myself.”</p>
