      <h1>'A poultry affair': University removes painting depicting dead animals after vegan students complain</h1>

      <p>The University of Cambridge removed a 17th-century oil painting from one of its dining rooms after vegan students complained they could not eat in its presence.</p>
      <p><i>The Fowl Market</i>, by Flemish artist Frans Snyders, showed a bearded man surrounded by animal carcasses ready to be sold and prepared for a feast.</p>
      <p>Cambridge's Fitzwilliam Museum donated the print to hang in the Hughes Hall dining room, where formal banquets are held twice a week. The painting <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/21/cambridge-university-students-cry-fowl-17th-century-painting/">made</a> a group of students uncomfortable, so the university removed it, according to the <i>Telegraph</i>.</p>
      <p>"Some diners felt unable to eat because it was on the wall. People who don't eat meat found it slightly repulsive. They asked for it to come down," a Fitzwilliam Museum representative said.</p>

      <p>The reason for the painting's removal caused some blowback on social media, but Hughes Hall bursar Victoria Espley <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/11/22/cambridge-dining-hall-vegans-baroque-painting-removed/">dismissed</a> the outrage, noting the university regularly removes and replaces its artwork.</p>
      <p>â€œAny debate over this painting that was on loan to us from the Fitzwilliam Museum is really a poultry affair," Espley said.</p>
      <p>The piece is now slated to be displayed in an exhibit over the history of veganism and vegetarianism.</p>
      <p>"Many people are turning to vegetarianism and veganism as a political choice as much as a dietary one, as we rethink our relationship with animals and their treatment in an industrialized world," said Victoria Avery and Melissa Calaresu, the new exhibit's curators.</p>
      <p>"Food choices are not only determined by political concerns about what we eat but also compounded by the moral anxieties which resonate around diet, self-image, over-consumption, and our bodies," the pair said.</p>
