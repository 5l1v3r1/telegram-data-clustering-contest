      <p>Godwin ISENYO, Kaduna.</p>
      <p>The Kaduna Division of the Court of Appeal on Friday reaffirmed Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State as duly elected in the March 23 Governorship Election in the state.</p>
      <p>The Appellate Court upheld the decision of the Justice Halima Shamaki – led tribunal who ruled in favour of the All Progressives Congress candidate, Governor Abdullahi Danguje.</p>
      <p>The Justice Tijjani Abubakar led five-man-panel in a unanimous decision, dismissed the entire petition of the Peoples Democratic Party’s candidate and its party for lacking in merit and reaffirmed the election of Governor Ganduje. </p>
      <p>The candidate of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party, Abbah Yusuf, had challenged the victory of Ganduje, who’s the candidate of the APC at the election tribunal.</p>
      <p>The governor had defeated his opponent after a rescheduled election by the Independent National Electoral Commission. </p>
      <p>On March 24, 2019, the INEC had  declared Ganduje winner. Ganduje scored 1,033,695 votes to defeat his closest rival, opposition People’s Democratic Party candidate Abba Yusuf who got 1,024,713 votes.</p>
      <p>Dissatisfied, the candidate of the PDP and his party dragged the governor before the Kano State Election Petition Tribunal for election irregularities among other charges.</p>
      <p>While delivering its judgement on Friday in Kaduna, the Appellate Court upheld the verdict of the tribunal.</p>
      <p>Justice Tijjani Abubakar in the unanimous judgement,  dismissed the entire petition of the PDP’s candidate for lacking in merit and reaffirmed the governor as the winner of the March 23 elections in the state. </p>
      <p>One of the counsels for the Peoples Democratic Party and its candidate, Bashir Yusuf Mohammed said the legal team of the PDP and its candidate,  would study the case and appeal the judgement.</p>
      <p>In his reaction, Kano State’s Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Ibrahim Mukhtar, described the ruling as a landmark judgement, commending the judiciary for upholding justice. </p>
      <p>“Today’s judgement shows that the judiciary is working and there is justice in our court,” he said.</p>
