      <h4>Chelsea returns from break with the huge task of playing away to Manchester City. Frank Lampard will need to be at his best with his best squad.</h4>
      <p>If given the choice between three points away to Manchester City or away to Valencia, most would pick the latter. The Champions League fixture is must win and the league can be clawed back later. But that will not be Frank Lampard’s calculus. One of his biggest traits is always picking a squad to win, not to survive. Manchester City are a giant, but a wounded one and Lampard will be looking to take advantage of that before thinking about the must win nature of the Valencia trip.</p>
      <h3>Kepa Arrizabalaga, 1, Goalkeeper, Spain</h3>
      <p>Obviously Arrizabalaga is going to start but the break was not the kindest to him. Not because of anything that happened on the pitch, but because of events off of it. Frank Lampard tried to bring Shay Given with him from Derby County over the summer but the club preferred an in house keeper coach. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7687131/Chelsea-boss-Frank-Lampard-make-Shay-Given-amid-concerns-Kepa-Arrizabalaga.html"><b>Reports</b></a> are now saying Lampard is making a fresh effort for Given to improve Arrizabalaga. That is hardly an endorsement, but things are pretty stagnant currently.</p>
      <h3>Cesar Azpilicueta, 28, Right back, Spain</h3>
      <p>The masses will want Reece James to start and they may have a point about it. There is also a trend of “if we play our slow fullbacks, they will be torched by their fast wingers” which is something that has almost always been proven a false fear before these big games. James could start and Lampard clearly does trust him, but he was away on the international break and Azpilicueta was not. The smart play might be the captain for City and James for Valencia.</p>
      <p>Kurt Zouma, 15, Center back, France</p>
      <p>Antonio Rudiger did not come up during the presser but he is unlikely to be thrown right back in against Manchester City anyways. Andreas Christensen could make an appearance, but his game is probably more suited to the Champions League fixture against Valencia than Zouma’s. And the Zouma-Fikayo Tomori partnership has been working very well. No need to rock the boat on this tricky away trip.</p>
      <p>Fikayo Tomori, 29, Center back, England</p>
      <p>Tomori finally got his England debut over the break, locking him in as an English international until the end of time (or until FIFA decides to change its rules). Tomori’s rise has been talked about several times but it will never not be incredible. From an error prone Championship center back to the best center back (on form) at a top six club and English fans begging for him to start in just about two years. That is an outstanding rise up the charts.</p>
      <h3>Emerson, 33, Left back, Italy</h3>
      <p>Emerson was called into the Italian team and it proved a mostly solid exercise in regaining match fitness. He sat out the second match which means he should be fairly fresh to play away to City and away to Valencia. How much and when Marcos Alonso plays over the coming months will be telling, especially if Emerson returns to his pre injury form and Ian Maatsen is suddenly seen as an option following the youth World Cup he just finished.</p>
