      <p>Labour’s manifesto launch raised eyebrows and sparked headlines yesterday, with experts suggesting that the party’s election pitch was both popular and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/much-will-labour-manifesto-actually-cost-11193972/">expensive</a>.</p>
      <p>Bold ideas about mass re-nationalisation, a major house building scheme, tackling climate change, a four-day working week and improving the NHS attracted most coverage – in a document dubbed ‘the most radical and ambitious plan to transform the country in decades’.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn’s party are also planning to hold a second referendum on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a>, raise the minimum wage and scrap tuition fees, in a blueprint some have labelled <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/extreme-unrealistic-labour-party-general-election-2019-manifesto-fact-checked-11196245/">‘extreme and unrealistic’</a>.</p>
      <p>But amid a host of attention-grabbing policies, here are some of the proposals that you might have overlooked.</p>

        <b>• Community groups will have first refusal on under-threat pubs</b>
      </p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Labour says pubs are ‘community hubs’ and is unhappy that 18 are closing each week.</p>
      <p>It says those under threat will be listed as ‘Assets of Community Value’, allowing community groups to have first a chance to buy them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>• Paid maternity and paternity leave increases</b>
      </p>
      <p>Parents will be pleased to learn that under a Labour government, paternity leave will double from two to four weeks, with statutory pay also going up.</p>
      <p>Similarly, maternity leave would rise from nine to 12 months.</p>

        <b>• An end to the badger cull</b>
      </p>
      <p>Labour says it will end the controversial badger cull, which aims to stop the spread of Bovine TB – branding it ‘the largest destruction of a protected species in living memory’.</p>
      <p>As part of its animal welfare offer, the party has also reiterated its opposition to fox hunting, promised to ban sales of snare and glue traps and stop imports of hunting trophies from threatened species.</p>
      <p>
        <b>• SATs will be scrapped</b>
      </p>
      <p>The party says it wants to end the ‘high stakes’ culture at schools by scrapping Key Stage 1 and 2 SATs exams for children aged five to 11.</p>
      <p>Instead, it says it will ‘refocus assessment on supporting pupil progress’.</p>

        <b>• Major welfare changes</b>
      </p>
      <p>Universal Credit, the benefits cap, the two child limit and the ‘bedroom tax’ are all set for the scrap heap under Labour plans which will dramatically reverse years of Conservative cuts to the welfare system.</p>

        <b>• Immigration and deportation changes</b>
      </p>
      <p>Family members of people entitled to live in the UK would not be deported under Labour, which would scrap the ‘minimum income requirements’ it says leads to some families being separated.</p>
      <p>Under a Labour government, indefinite detention would also end, along with the Immigration Act 2014.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn plans to close the controversial detention centres Yarl’s Wood and Brook House.</p>

        <b>• Rent caps – cities will be given new ‘powers’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Labour will crack down on landlords with rent controls, open-ended tenancies, and new regulations on ‘minimum standards’ for rental properties.</p>
      <p>Rent charges will be capped in line with inflation and cities given ‘powers to cap rents further’ – though there is little explanation of what this would mean in practice.</p>
      <p>
        <b>• A claim to ‘end rough sleeping within 5 years’</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is an extremely ambitious target that Labour says it will meet through ‘a prime minister-led taskforce’. It says it will expand and upgrade hostels, make an additional 8,000 homes available</p>
      <p>for those with a history of rough sleeping and give local councils £1 billion in extra funding to find solutions.</p>
      <p>There will also be a new levy on second home owners to pay for the plans.</p>
      <p>
        <b>• Lobbying reforms</b>
      </p>
      <p>Labour says it will ban political donations from ‘tax avoiders and evaders’, and introduce a lobbying register to keep track of who is contacting ‘all senior government employees’.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>It will also ask for records of all digital political advertising.</p>
      <p>
        <b>• Voting rights for EU citizens</b>
      </p>
      <p>Labour claims it would ‘oversee the largest extension of the franchise in generations’ by reducing the voting age to 16 and, crucially, by giving full voting rights to ‘all UK residents’. In practice, that means EU citizens – who can currently only vote in local and European elections – will be able to have their say in future general elections.</p>
      <p>The party would also abandon plans to introduce voter ID.</p>
      <p>
        <b>• Changes to FOI laws</b>
      </p>
      <p>The party is aiming to ‘bring greater transparency’ by extending Freedom of Information rules to ‘cover private providers of public services’.</p>
      <p>Currently, only public bodies are obliged to provide information, so this could represent a big shift in what journalists and others can find out about.</p>
