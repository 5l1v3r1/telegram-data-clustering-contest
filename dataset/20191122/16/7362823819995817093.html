      <h1>Ex-Boston College student pleads not guilty in suicide texting case involving boyfriend</h1>

      <p>A former Boston College student who prosecutors say sent texts encouraging her boyfriend to kill himself pleaded not guilty Friday to a manslaughter charge.</p>
      <p>Inyoung You, 21, entered the plea to an October indictment charging her with sending more than 47,000 texts to Alexander Urtula, 22, of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> in the weeks before his May 20 suicide in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/massachusetts">Boston</a>.</p>
      <p>She showed no expression as prosecutors detailed the case against her at the arraignment.</p>
      <p>The court appearance came after You returned to the U.S. from South Korea, <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/Arraignment-for-Former-BC-Student-Charged-in-Boyfriends-Suicide-565320821.html">NBC 10 Boston</a> reported.</p>

      <p>The judge set bail at $5,000 and also ordered You to surrender her passport and report to probation twice a week, according to the station.</p>
      <p>The trial date was set for November 2020.</p>

      </p>
      <p>At the arraignment, prosecutors told the judge You became upset when she found out Urtula had been in touch with a former girlfriend, the station reported.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors have said You exerted complete control over Urtula emotionally and mentally, during a tumultuous 18-month relationship.</p>
      <p>You hired a public relations firm that released text messages suggesting she tried to stop Urtula from killing himself, <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/part-of-the-texts-shared-between-a-bc-student-and-the-girl-accused-in-his-suicide/1010390137">Fox 25 Boston reported</a>. Urtula jumped to his death from the top of a parking garage on the day of his graduation from Boston College.</p>
      <p>You's prosecution has been likened to the suicide texting case that another Massachusetts prosecutor brought against <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/michelle-carter-massachusetts-denied-parole-early-prison-release-boyfriend-suicide-manslaughter">Michelle Carter in 2017.</a></p>

      <p>Carter went to prison after a judge found her guilty of sending texts encouraging her boyfriend to kill himself, which he ultimately did.</p>
