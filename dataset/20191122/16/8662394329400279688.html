      <h1>Icon Water hoses down row over removal of old red fire hydrants</h1>

      <p>An inner-south advocate says Icon Water is stripping the older parts of Canberra of its heritage by removing ageing red fire hydrants.</p>

      <p>Inner South Canberra Business Council chair John-Paul Romano is also calling for a broader discussion about the future of historic street furniture in the national capital, saying the approach so far has been ad-hoc and underwhelming.</p>
      <p>"Canberrans, especially Canberrans who have lived here for a long time, would miss this street furniture," he said.</p>
      <p>But Icon Water says only non-heritage-listed fire hydrants are being removed to make way for new ones compatible with upgraded water mains.</p>
      <p>The removed hydrants would be held in storage in case a heritage-listed hydrant was damaged, for example by being hit by a car, and needed to be repaired or replaced.</p>
      <p>More than 14.5kms of water mains in Canberra's older suburbs are being replaced as part of a 2019-20 renewal program</p>
      <p>The mains were being upgraded to improve water quality and flow and minimise the risk of water mains failure.</p>

      <p>Icon Water said the upgrades were to ensure high-quality and safe drinking water and "continue to meet our obligations to provide water flow as required by ACT Fire and Rescue".</p>
      <p>In areas where water mains were not yet being upgraded, the pillar hydrants would remain in place and operational.</p>
      <p>"The pillar hydrants are being replaced with spring hydrants," a spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>"Spring hydrants are both compatible with our upgraded infrastructure and meet national standards to provide direct access to our pipelines for firefighting purposes.</p>
      <p>"They are set into the pavement or road, flush with the surface, and are marked with FH."</p>
      <p>The old red hydrants identified in the Heritage Act remained in place, even if not operational. All those not listed in the act "will eventually be replaced as water mains are renewed across the ACT".</p>
      <p>Mr Romano said the original hydrants were installed between 1920 and 1940 and were "a part of Canberra's history".</p>
      <p>"Whether they are functional or not, they've been in disrepair for years," he said.</p>
      <p>"The government hasn't restored them and many are missing parts like caps or chains."</p>
      <p>Mr Romano said the red hydrants had been removed from near his business in Manuka and along his whole street in Forrest.</p>
      <blockquote>The government should restore all heritage street furniture in Canberra and it would likely be for a meagre amount.<cite>Inner South Canberra Business Council chair John-Paul Romano</cite></blockquote>
      <p>"If it was a private developer, there would be a huge backlash and the expectation of penalties from the government. However, because it is a utility, I doubt there will be such a penalty," he said.</p>
      <p>"It obviously raises a more prominent issue about heritage street furniture - chairs, street lights, bush shelters, street signs and hydrants, to name a few.</p>
      <p>"The government has done almost nothing to protect them and only paid for their partial restoration by giving grants to community groups."</p>
      <p>Mr Romano said replacing older-style street lights with flat LED lights was another example of the old Canberra being taken away.</p>
      <p>"The government should restore all heritage street furniture in Canberra and it would likely be for a meagre amount," he said.</p>
      <p>It follows a stoush back in 2008 when a Narrabundah resident complained about original concrete street lamps being taken from her suburb to be relocated in ''more upmarket'' Kingston, with a suggestion some residents were treated differently to others.</p>
