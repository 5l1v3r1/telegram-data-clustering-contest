        <b>EX-CELTIC ace Kieran Tierney shocked his Arsenal team-mates as he braved the cold in a short sleeved shirt and shorts.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> full-back trained in London without extra layers as temperatures plummet across the UK.</p>

      <p>And team-mates Alexander Lacazette and Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang couldn't believe the Scot as Auba trolled Tierney on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Posting a snap of himself and Lacazette laughing and pointing at training Auba wrote: "@kierantierney : with short sleeves and Shorts</p>
      <p>"Us: Daaaammmmnnnnn @Lacazettealex"</p>
      <p>Tierney notoriously joined Celtic skipper Scott Brown in exclusively training in shorts and short sleeve shirts at Lennoxtown.</p>

      <p>And they caught the eye of the press in Russia as the pair strolled around St Petersburg in short sleeve shirts before a Europa League clash.</p>
      <p>But Lacazette and Aubameyang were fully kitted out in jumpers, trackies and gloves as they were clearly feeling the cold.</p>
      <p>Tierney laughed off the jokes from his team-mates as he re-posted the picture and adding some laughing and an snowflake emoji.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week we told how Tierney held a green smoke bomb before revealing the Arsenal-Hoops connection that's helped him settle.</p>

      <p>The left-back traded life in the family home to living himself in London.</p>
      <p>He admits the transition has been difficult but he's been made to feel at home by the Scottish staff on the Arsenal books - who share his love for Celtic.</p>
      <p>And says he has created bonds with the likes of Hector Bellerin, Dino Mavropanos, Callum Chambers and Rob Holding.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Pro Direct Soccer, he said: "It was a hard transition. I lived with my family right until I had to move.</p>
      <p>"It's been in the house myself, doing the cooking and washing.</p>
      <p>"Everyone has been great, even the staff.</p>
      <p>"There’s a few Scottish staff as well – Celtic fans – so they’ve helped me settle in and make me feel at home.”</p>
