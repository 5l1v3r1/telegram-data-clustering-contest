      <p>I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here 2019 has been underway for less than a week, but we already know when the big finale will air.</p>
      <p>ITV have confirmed that the next <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/celebs/adele-roberts-looked-completely-different-343875"><i>King or Queen of the jungle</i></a> will be crowned on Sunday, December 8 - just over two weeks from now.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, the campers won't be too smelly by that point - after all, hosts <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/im-celebrity-reveals-two-brand-new-campmates-343700"><i>Ant and Dec</i> </a>have said that switching the camp's traditional fire for a gas stove has made things easier on the nose.</p>

      <p>"The difference this year is that we have the gas stoves in there, no smoke," the host's explained on last night's I'm A Celeb: Extra Camp. "They don't stink as much."</p>
      <p>However, presenter <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/entertainment/im-celebrity-sees-stars-head-to-australia-ahead-of-new-series-342742"><i>Joel Dommett</i></a> mused that it has had the opposite effect, saying: "They smell of BO instead, because they are all smelling themselves and they stink whereas usually you just smell fire the whole time."</p>
      <p>Ant then joked: "At the trial with Roman and Adele, woo, I am not saying what one, but one of them honked!"</p>

      <p>Dec added: "One of them has got the nickname cheese fruit."</p>
