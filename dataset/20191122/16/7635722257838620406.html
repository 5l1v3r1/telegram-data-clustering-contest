        <b>It's been just over two years since Kevin Doyle announced his retirement as a footballer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Ireland striker has always had a passion for horse racing and aside from occasional coaching and punditry, horses are what's keeping him busy.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the ex-Cork City, Wolves, Reading and Colorado Rapids player has been keeping a keen eye on particular horses.</p>
      <p>The Wexford native spent €155K to purchase race-winning charge Altior's half-brother. It's a horse that's already made a big impression on him.</p>
      <p>"Once the hammer goes down, he's yours. We got him down straight away and he's down with the other foals," Doyle told us on <i>Friday Night Racing</i>.</p>
      <p>"We sold two [foals] at the sales. I sold one and my father sold one and we have eight left, with two going in a couple of weeks at Goffs.</p>
      <p>"He's in with the rest of them and is treated the same as all the rest of them."</p>
      <h3>Breeder</h3>
      <p>The 36-year-old also gave an insight into why he has such a grá for the breeder's side of working with horses. It's something his own father has done for a long time before him.</p>
      <p>"Growing up around them, I always had an interest," he said.</p>
      <p>"And once I had a few pound of my one, I bought a mare. My first horse at the derby sale in 2007-08 [was] a half-sister to Cousin Vinny who was a very good horse in his day.</p>
      <p>"And I've bred from her ever since. I never put her in training or anything. Her first foal went on to be a winner."</p>
      <p>Delving into the world of a breeder means he's not twiddling his thumbs post-retirement.</p>
      <p>"It's a full-time/part-time job but I have a bug for it," he said.</p>
      <p>"It puts a smile on my face, it's a hobby which is a joy. And hopefully make some money out of it, that's the plan.</p>
      <p>"Talking to ye about this give me probably more enjoyment than talking about [other things]. I've been lucky since I came home. It's a big thing in your life retiring from sport.</p>
      <p>"You see all the talk about depression and players really struggling and I've been so lucky to come home and I'm not in England in a house, sitting there twiddling my thumbs, wondering what I'm going to do with my life now.</p>
      <p>"It's made my transition a lot easier."</p>
      <p>He also <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/sport/kevin-doyle-qualifying-ireland-928161"><b>shared his thoughts</b></a> on how he thinks Ireland will do in the Euro 2020 playoffs.</p>
