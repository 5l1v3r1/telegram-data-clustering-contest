      <p>Today’s figures come after the Liberal Democrats, Labour and the Green Party revealed their election manifestos.</p>

      <p>Corbyn has divided opinion with his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/much-will-labour-manifesto-actually-cost-11193972/">radical taxation and spending plans</a>, which Chancellor Sajid Javid brands ‘totally unsustainable’, despite claims they are fully costed.</p>
      <p>Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson promised to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/lib-dems-launch-stop-brexit-manifesto-setting-party-remain-11189629/">stop Brexit altogether</a> if they win and vowed to build 300,000 homes a year by 2024.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives are still yet to reveal when their manifesto will be unveiled, but Treasury Chief Secretary Rishi Sunak gave assurances it would happen ‘very shortly’.</p>
      <p>Rejecting the traditional manifesto, Nigel Farage launched a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/brexit-party-vows-cap-migration-scrap-bbc-licence-fee-house-lords-11201662/">‘contract with the people’ this morning</a>, including a 50 per cent cut in the foreign aid budget and a ‘clean-break Brexit’.</p>
