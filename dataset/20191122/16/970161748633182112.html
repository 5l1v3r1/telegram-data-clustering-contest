      <p>The Grand Tour has finally unleashed the first trailer for The Grand Tour presents Seamen, which opens with the most dangerous trip Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May have ever embarked on and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/13/jeremy-clarkson-reveals-james-may-almost-killed-filming-grand-tour-season-4-10562646/">almost left them for dead.</a></p>
      <p>This series will be <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/14/grand-tour-season-4-runs-risk-losing-magic-jeremy-clarkson-richard-hammond-james-may-ditch-studio-audience-9532031/">the first without a studio audience</a> and instead sees the trio endure a series of epic road trips, kicking off in Cambodia and Vietnam, only there’s already one key ingredient for their car show missing – cars.</p>

      <p>The boys are ditching wheels for boats, and it’s an immediate disaster from the get-go. From colliding into locals, food stalls and each other – Clarkson and co. cause chaos during their perilous 800km journey across Tonlé Sap Lake and through Mekong Delta.</p>

      <p>Clarkson previously revealed four fisherman were killed just ‘inches away’ from where The Grand Tour had been filming as extreme weather caused them to abandon their mission.</p>
      <p>‘It’s about the only time health and safety has made the correct decision,’ he told The Sun.</p>
      <p>‘I, of course, was fine, but May had to abandon ship as crew boats were filling with water.’</p>
      <p>‘We are excited to announce the launch date for The Grand Tour presents: Seamen, the first of our epic adventure specials from Prime Video’s much loved trio, Clarkson, Hammond and May,’ enthused Georgia Brown, Director of European Amazon Originals for Prime Video.</p>
      <p>‘We know fans love to see the guys take on these incredible adventures across exotic locations and The Grand Tour presents: Seamen does just that – this feature length special promises to be a thrilling off-road escapade, full of challenges and jeopardy, climaxing in one of the most dangerous and exciting challenges Jeremy, Richard and James may have ever endured – viewers are in for a rocky ride!’</p>

      <p>As it stands just two episodes of the revamped The Grand Tour have been announced with more expected to come crashing in over the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? host Clarkson revealed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/grand-tours-jeremy-clarkson-richard-hammond-james-may-reunited-crew-marooned-tropical-island-11066754/">the gang were ‘marooned’ on an island</a> 500 miles away from their crew while filming the next instalment. Sounds like another smooth ride then, right?</p>
