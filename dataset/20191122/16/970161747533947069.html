      <h1>Black history shouldn't be erased in order to call out Labour's antisemitism</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:34:15+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://metro.co.uk/author/nadine-batchelor-hunt/" target="_blank">Nadine Batchelor-Hunt</a></address>
      <p>Labour’s failure to deal with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/11/this-is-how-jeremy-corbyn-can-rid-the-labour-party-of-anti-semitism-10185828/">antisemitism in the party</a> properly and efficiently over the last few years has rightfully gathered anger from the British Jewish community.</p>
      <p>The pain it has caused, and some outstanding issues on the matter, continue to make this problem an explosive one to discuss.</p>
      <p>However, as a black Jew who occupies a unique space in this debate, I began to notice a disturbing trend of people entering the ‘antisemitism in Labour’ debate by drawing false parallels with discrimination to black people – with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/rachel-rileys-jeremy-corbyn-tweet-offensive-11192896/">Rachel Riley’s t-shirt</a> now becoming a watershed moment.</p>
      <p>The t-shirt, in which she photoshopped <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jeremy-corbyn/">Jeremy Corbyn</a>’s ‘Defend the right to demonstrate against apartheid’ message to ‘Jeremy Corbyn is a racist endeavour,’ is a manifestation of how severe the practice of co-opting black suffering has become.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Erasing a message about protesting South African apartheid and replacing it with one that suggests similarities between Corbyn’s Labour and apartheid shows little to no understanding of anti-black racism – and verges on becoming racist in itself.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time Riley has done something like this; <a href="https://twitter.com/rachelrileyrr/status/1150396580857634816?lang=en">she compared a brass-band playing ‘Hava Nagila’</a> at the Durham Miners’ Gala to ‘As tasteful as showing Black Panther at a Klan rally’.</p>
      <p>Whatever your opinions on Corbyn or <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/labour-party/">Labour</a>, I think it’s pretty clear to anyone with a basic understanding of racism that suggesting either are like South African apartheid or the Ku Klux Klan (which used to lynch and burn black people alive) is beyond disrespectful and trivialises and devalues black lives.</p>
      <p>This is not just something Riley is guilty of but it is part of a broader trend; prominent figures in fighting antisemitism in Labour have also fallen into the same behaviour.</p>
      <p>Chief rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/29/jeremy-corbyns-comments-compared-to-enoch-powells-rivers-of-blood-speech-7892270/">compared Corbyn’s comments to Enoch Powell’s ‘rivers of blood’ speech</a> – something echoed during a Telegraph video yesterday on antisemitism in Labour.</p>

      <p>Powell is one of the most notorious and dangerous anti-black racists in recent British history, with his speech warning that ‘the black man will have the whip hand over the white man’.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere, I cannot count how many times I have seen people suggest that Labour and Corbyn are ‘as bad’ as the Conservatives and Boris Johnson – as if their records on racism are on any level the same.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/07/if-the-conservatives-are-to-truly-tackle-islamophobia-boris-johnson-must-be-reprimanded-7809037/">Johnson has a record on racism</a> so appalling that he would be <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-letterbox-muslim-remark-piccaninnies-police-barred-neil-basu-a9045006.html">unable to become a police officer</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>Now, more than ever, Jews and other ethnic minorities need to stand side by side in solidarity with each other against the rapidly growing threat of white supremacy.</blockquote>
      <p>When it comes to anti-black racism he has described black people as ‘piccanninies’ with ‘watermelon smiles’, published a eugenics article arguing ‘orientals’ have lower IQ (a ‘science’ used by Nazis to dehumanise Jews during the Holocaust) and celebrates colonialism – an endeavour responsible for the African slave trade.</p>
      <p>Additionally, this government is responsible for the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/10/17/why-we-need-to-keep-talking-about-the-windrush-generation-8040920/">Windrush Scandal</a>, which deported black citizens after racially motivated harassment, some of whom subsequently died.</p>
      <p>And then, of course, there are Tory MPs’ own records – such as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/07/10/mp-described-brexit-deal-as-a-n-in-the-woodpile-6768382/">Anne Marie Morris using the word ‘n****r’ to describe a Brexit deal</a> and Sir Desmond Swayne defending blacking up, saying it was ‘fun’ and the hardest part was washing it off.</p>
      <p>Both remain in the party.</p>
      <p>This doesn’t even begin to look at the party’s record on other ethnic minorities, which includes <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/07/boris-johnson-wont-apologise-saying-women-burkas-look-like-letter-boxes-7812073/">Johnson’s comments on Muslim women looking like ‘bank robbers’ and ‘letterboxes’</a>, sparking a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/02/significant-spike-anti-muslim-hate-crimes-boris-johnsons-burka-comments-10669096/">375 per cent increase in hate crimes</a> against Muslims.</p>
      <p>In the fight against antisemitism the experiences and suffering of other ethnic groups cannot be inappropriately or incongruously co-opted or used as a tool.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>All doing so achieves is alienating black people, creating feelings of resentment between ethnic groups and weakening the battle against antisemitism by showing no understanding of contemporary racism.</p>
      <p>How can one expect the vital task of fighting antisemitism in Labour to be taken seriously and for other communities to stand in solidarity when prominent public figures on the matter are comparing Labour to the KKK?</p>
      <p>Now, more than ever, Jews and other ethnic minorities need to stand side by side in solidarity with each other against the rapidly growing threat of white supremacy.</p>
      <p>More than ever the threat of antisemitism needs to be taken seriously.</p>
      <p>More than ever we must fight antisemitism in a way that does not cause hurt, pain, or erasure to other communities.</p>
      <p>Ethnic minorities are stronger together than apart – which is why a t-shirt must be the turning point for how we talk about antisemitism and racism in contemporary politics.</p>
      <p>We must approach race, racism and antisemitism in an intersectional way to avoid alienating allies and ensure we don’t erase or disillusion those sharing similar struggles.</p>
      <p>We must listen to each other and be aware of the similarities and differences in the fight against racism for each community – only then will we succeed in our ambitions to end racial inequality.</p>
