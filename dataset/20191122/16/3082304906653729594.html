        <b>Zlatan Ibrahimovic is a great champion, says Stefano Pioli, but AC Milan’s coach is not focusing on new signings just yet.</b>
      </p>
      <p>AC Milan coach Stefano Pioli has repeated his praise of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, but insists the Serie A club are not yet focusing on new signings.</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic has been linked with a return to Milan, where he spent two seasons between 2010 and 2012 before moving to Paris Saint-Germain, after the 38-year-old left MLS club LA Galaxy.</p>
      <p>Pioli has previously lauded Ibrahimovic, however, he insisted it was too early to talk about the upcoming transfer window in January.</p>
      <p>Milan’s coach was pressed for his thoughts on Ibrahimovic – who is now reported to be a target for new Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho – ahead of Saturday’s clash with Napoli, but Pioli reiterated the Rossoneri are not yet focused on January arrivals.</p>
      <p>“I have already explained what I think, he is a great champion for his technical skills and his professionalism,” Pioli told a news conference.</p>
      <p>“I end it here, our present is too important.</p>
      <p>“With the team I have to think only of the field and tomorrow’s match. For judgments on the market, I will do it later, we are only in November.</p>
      <p>“We are focused on the difficult and very important match of tomorrow. We have to give 200 per cent and that’s what I expect from the team.”</p>

      <p>Milan sit 14th in Serie A, having taken just 13 points from their opening 12 matches of the season.</p>
      <p>However, Pioli believes Milan’s display in a 1-0 defeat to Juventus before the international break gives his side a platform from which to build on.</p>
      <p>“It starts from the performance in Turin, which was against one of the best in Europe,” Pioli added.</p>
      <p>“We now play against a strong team like Napoli which is equipped for the Champions League and to win the Scudetto. Napoli are strong but we are not far behind.”</p>
