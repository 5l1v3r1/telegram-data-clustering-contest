      <h1>St Andrews students urged to be wary after series of attacks</h1>
      <h2>Police have warned St Andrews’ student population to be vigilant following a number of incidents in the town in recent weeks.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:41:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/craigsmith/" target="_blank">Craig Smith</a></address>
      <p>Four incidents involving violence against students have been reported between Sunday October 13 and Thursday November 21.</p>
      <p>Police Scotland have confirmed that five people aged between 14 and 21 have been charged and reported to the relevant authorities in relation to three of the incidents, although investigations into another assault in South Street on October 13 remain ongoing.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Matt Spencer, of the community policing team in St Andrews, said: “Thankfully nobody has been seriously injured in any of these incidents but understandably they have caused concern among the student population.</p>
      <p>“We want to ensure students in St Andrews continue to feel safe while they live and study in the town.</p>
      <p>“We are liaising with a number of partners, including the university, student association and local elected members.</p>
      <p>“Students should be able to go about their lives without any fear of crime but I would urge people to be vigilant.</p>
      <p>“Anyone who has any concerns can contact police by calling 101 or 999 in an emergency.</p>
      <p>“Students can also seek advice from appropriate services at the university.”</p>
      <p>Sergeant Spencer said there will be increased patrols and a “visible police presence” in and around key areas of the university town for the foreseeable future to help reassure local people.</p>
      <p>“We are grateful for the support of the local community while we carry out this work,” he added.</p>
      <p>Anyone who can help Police Scotland with their inquiries should contact 101.</p>
