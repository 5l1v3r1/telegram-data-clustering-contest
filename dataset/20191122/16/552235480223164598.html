      <h1>Plastic film recycling plea to PKC residents</h1>
      <h2>Scheme involving local supermarkets</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:18:26+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:18</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Clark, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/rachel-clark/</a></address>
      <p>Householders in Perth and Kinross are being encouraged to use plastic film recycling points at their local supermarket.</p>
      <p>Every fortnight, eight per cent of the average household general waste bin in Perth and Kinross contains plastic film.</p>
      <p>However, a large proportion of this can be taken back to the supermarket for recycling.</p>
      <p>Mark Butterworth, head of environmental and consumer services at Perth and Kinross Council, said: “Plastic film seems to take up so much of the general waste bin - and a lot of it is unavoidable.</p>
      <p>“Not everything can be recycled at the kerbside, but designated collection points and take back schemes are becoming the norm.</p>
      <p>“There are numerous recycling points for glass bottles and jars, textiles, foil and small electricals across Perth and Kinross and the deposit return scheme is on the way.</p>
      <p>“Supermarket recycling points for plastic film like the one at Morrisons Perth branch, is just another example of waste that we can get into the habit of diverting from landfill.”</p>
      <p>A lot of resources have been used to create the plastic, including oil from the North Sea.</p>
      <p>Instead of sending this material to landfill, it can be taken back to the supermarket so it can be made into something new.</p>
      <p>Stephanie Duncan, community champion at Morrisons in Perth, said: “To take part, shoppers are encouraged to put a carrier bag aside at home and put in it any empty, clean and dry plastic films.</p>
      <p>“When the bag is full, take it for recycling at the same time as your next food shop.”</p>
      <p>Morrisons, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Tesco supermarkets now have plastic film and carrier bag recycling points in the entrance of their stores.</p>
      <p>This includes all plastic bags except biodegradable or compostable bags, bread bags, breakfast cereal liners, shrink wrap and ring joiners from multi-packs of water and cans, frozen food bags, dry cleaning bags and bags covering new clothing, magazine and newspaper wrappers, bags for loose fruit and vegetables, bubble wrap and low-density polyethylene.</p>
