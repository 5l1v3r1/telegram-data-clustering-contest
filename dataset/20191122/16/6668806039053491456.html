      <p>Mouni Roy who made her film debut with Gold opposite Akshay Kumar went on to do Made In China opposite Rajkummar Rao. She will soon be seen in Ayan Mukerji's Brahmastra. While the earlier reports stated that she was roped in for Anand Pandit's Chehre, the latest ones suggest that she had to let go of the movie due to her busy schedule.</p>
      <p>Chehere is a mystery thriller to be directed by Rumi Jaffery. A source close to the film revealed to a daily that Mouni had projects aplenty in her kitty and hence couldn’t find dates for Chehere. After Brahmastra, Mouni's dates are blocked for other commitments. The makers were keen on her being a part of this project but her dates don't match.</p>
