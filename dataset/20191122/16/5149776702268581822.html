      <h1>Teenager who was being sexually assaulted sent text to her dad asking for help</h1>
      <h2>She had meant to send the message to a girl friend of hers</h2>

      <p>A court has told how a sex attack victim sent a desperate text to her father reading, 'Help me. He is raping me.'</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old sent the message after being led to a dark alleyway near a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/mansfield">Mansfield</a> club, Nottingham Crown Court heard.</p>
      <p>The message was intended for a girl friend she had been with that night, but she sent it to her dad in error.</p>
      <p>Dawn Pritchard, prosecuting, told the court: "One can only imagine how her father felt when he saw that."</p>
      <p>Custody for 18 months was ordered for Benjamin Hoyland, 21, who admitted sexual assault on March 31, 2018. He was put on the Sex Offenders' Register for a decade.</p>
      <p>Miss Pritchard said that Hoyland had been with his girlfriend in the Lexis club but she had gone home. When he saw the teenager, he said she was "nice" and they kissed.</p>
      <p>"The kissing was with consent," said Miss Pritchard. "He said he wanted to go somewhere quiet and she said okay.</p>
      <p>"They went through the main entrance and out. She asked where they were going and he said something like 'nowhere.' They went into an alleyway."</p>

      <p>Hoyland exposed himself and managed to pull off some of her clothes. The teenager refused to carry out a sex act, said Miss Pritchard.</p>
      <p>"She said no. He didn't listen and she tried to prevent what he was trying to do. She then sent the text message.</p>
      <p>"She then heard her name being shouted," Miss Pritchard told <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/courts">the court</a>. Those shouts came from her friends who found her "shaking and crying."</p>
      <p>Hoyland ran off down West Gate.</p>
      <p>Judge Sally Hancox told him: "What happened that evening, in perhaps the most simplistic of terms, was rough and deeply unpleasant.</p>
      <p>"You committed a sexual offence against someone who was all but a stranger.</p>
      <p>"The wider public must know that behaviour of this type cannot and will not be tolerated in a civilised society. She clearly said no but you persisted."</p>
      <p>The judge ordered a not guilty verdict on a rape charge which was initially faced by Hoyland of St Peter's Avenue, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/worksop">Worksop</a>.</p>
      <p>Matthew Smith, mitigating, said that Hoyland used the words "disgusting and frightening" to describe the offence.</p>
      <p>He had written a letter of apology saying: "I can only imagine how you and your family must have felt for the last 20 months. I am thoroughly sorry for my actions."</p>
      <p>The offence was "completely out of character" for Hoyland.</p>
      <p>Mr Smith added: "He has let himself and his family down."</p>
      <p>The court heard that his victim still has nightmares. A medical examination found she had suffered abrasions in the attack.</p>
