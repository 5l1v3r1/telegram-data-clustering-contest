      <p>After edging down to 108.50 area in the early trading hours of the American session, the USD/JPY pair reversed its direction and advanced to a fresh daily top of 108.73 but seems to be having a difficult time stretching higher as investors continue to react developments surrounding the United States (US)-China trade dispute.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, US President Donald Trump said a trade deal with China was "potentially very close" to cause safe-haven assets such as the JPY to lose interest. The 10-year US Treasury bond yield, which lost as much as 2% earlier in the day, erased almost all of its losses on Trump's comment.</p>
      <p>However, following a Reuters report suggesting that all five commissioners of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will vote to bar Chinese telecommunication giant Huawei and ZTE from government subsidy programs, the 10-year US T-bond yield lost its traction and was last down 1% on the day, suggesting that risk <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a> has started to sour on this headline.</p>
      <p>Reflecting the shift in the market mood, the USD/JPY pair turned flat on the day near 108.60 and is looking to close the second straight week in the negative territory.</p>
      <h3>USD strength helps pair stay above 108.50</h3>
      <p>On the other hand, the IHS Markit's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 52.2 in November's preliminary reading to surpass the market expectation of 51.5 and provided a boost to the greenback. Additionally, the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index improved to 96.8 in November to support the US Dollar Index, which was last up 0.25% on the day at 98.20.</p>
