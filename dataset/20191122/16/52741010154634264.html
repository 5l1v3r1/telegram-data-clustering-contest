      <p>TORONTO — Student groups who won a court challenge against the provincial government say they hope funding to campus organizations can be restored as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>An Ontario Divisional Court ruling Thursday struck down a directive making some post-secondary student fees optional, saying it is inconsistent with the schools' autonomy.</p>
      <p>The government has said the goal of the initiative was to give students more control over how they spend their money.</p>
      <p>But the Canadian Federation of Students has called it an attempt to silence voices that hold the government accountable, such as student unions and campus media.</p>
      <p>Kayla Weiler, the federation's Ontario representative, says she is unsure if the fee schedule and full funding for those groups can resume for next semester or next year.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the attorney general says the government is reviewing the court ruling.</p>
