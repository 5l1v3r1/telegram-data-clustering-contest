      <h3>IT’S ALL TO PLAY(-OFF) FOR</h3>
      <p>With the group stages over and 20 teams already qualified for Euro 2020, there are still four places left up for grabs to be contested by 16 teams. Failing to qualify for a major football tournament has never been more difficult, but this morning Scotland fans were given a better idea of assessing their team’s chances of doing so for the 10th time in a row. Through the byzantine process of the Uefa wheeze that is the Nations League, Scotland have been guaranteed the safety net of a play-off spot since before the start of the group stage and today they found out they will entertain Israel in a one-off semi-final at Hampden Park, with the winners, Israel, going on to play whoever prevails between Norway v Serbia in a winner-takes-all final away from home.</p>
      <p>“The draw is what it is,” said Scotland manager Steve Clarke, who is who he is. “I never get too carried away about who we’re going to get. We will be familiar with Israel because we played them in the Nations League group stage, and hopefully we can get a positive outcome. We had two close games, lost away and won at Hampden. It would be nice to repeat that. We’re not disappointed that the final is away from home. You have to take what you get.” And while such stirring rhetoric hardly called to mind William Wallace’s pre-battle pep-talk to the troops in Braveheart, Scottish fans would almost certainly be delighted to take what they’re guaranteed to get if they can win their play-off games: a place in Euro 2020 Group D against England, who they’d play at Wembley.</p>
      <p>Following the draw, Clarke urged Scottish fitba’s governing bodies to do “all they can” to help his team by postponing a round of domestic fixtures at the end of March, to give him more time with his players … many of whom don’t actually play in the Scottish league. Quick to lend Clarke his support, Pope’s O’Rangers manager Stevie Gerrard insisted he would have no problem with such an arrangement. “Ultimately it will be down to the SFA and stuff,” he said. “We’ll go with the flow and if it means us skipping a game or adjusting a game we’ll do everything we can to support Scotland. That’s what you’ve got to do.” Well you’d think so, Stevie, bless your innocence … but this is the Scottish FA we’re talking about, a body of individuals who may well decide they don’t have to do anything of the kind.</p>
      <p>In other play-off news, the Republic O’Ireland and Norn Iron will meet in what could be the mother of all needle matches in Windsor Park, what with a place at Euro 2020 the prize, but have to see off Slovakia and Bosnia and Herzogovina respectively to set up what would be a decidedly raucous Backstop Derby. For Theme Pub O’Fiver and his Lambeg drum-banging cousin No! No! No! No! No! We Want To Walk Down That Road Fiver it promises to be a very tense affair.</p>
      <h3>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h3>
      <p>“I advise my players to have $ex for short periods and with the minimum of effort and use positions where they are under their partners and preferably with their wives. Because if with others, well, that will need extra action” – Antonio Conte, there, revealing that he doesn’t just coach his players how to play football.</p>

      <h3>FIVER LETTERS</h3>
      <p>“Do you think Liverpool might try and copyright the word ‘expansion’?” – Jon Millard.</p>
      <p>“Rather than Peter Oh’s Wilco-related suggestion in yesterday’s Fiver letters, I’m sure that Real’s more likely response to Gareth Bale’s flag shenanigans would have been Whisky Tango Foxtrot” – Bruce Bradley.</p>
      <p>“So the Corby will be the only press that will be seen at Spurs for the rest of the season then” – Gerry Rickard.</p>
      <p>“Mourinho, a chronicle of a death unfolded: November 2019 – ‘I am excited about the talent I am looking at’. December 2019 – ‘I stand by my lads, they are giving the best, I can’t ask for more’. January 2020 – ‘Difficult to compete with the likes of City who can spend £70m on a defender’. February 2020 – ‘There is no spirit in this team - I do not mind losing - but this is not acceptable’. March 2020 – Flashes three fingers … ‘Respect, respect, respect’. April 2020 - ‘Ask Levy, ask the team - they know the answer’. May 2020 - ‘Levy thanks José for his invaluable contribution to the club, but the board has to take hard decision’” – Krishna Moorthy.</p>

      <h3>NEWS, BITS AND BOBS</h3>
      <p>Given they both enjoyed 3-1 wins over José Mourinho last season, it’s little wonder Pep Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp were falling over each other to welcome him back, with Pep calling him “incredible” and Klopp cooing it “was nice to have him” in the Premier League again.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard, meanwhile, said that unlike José he would never manage Spurs. “I can firmly say no, and you can replay that in 10 years. It wouldn’t happen,” he roared, inviting trouble in November 2029.</p>
      <p>Football’s world players’ union Fifpro has described the decision to ban the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/shakhtardonetsk">Shakhtar Donetsk</a> captain Taison – for reacting to abuse – as playing into the hands of racists.</p>
      <p>The EFL has appealed against Bolton’s suspended five-point penalty for failing to fulfil two league fixtures, declaring the sanction <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/22/efl-appeals-against-lenient-bolton-punishment-for-failing-to-fulfil-fixtures">“too lenient”</a>.</p>

      <p>Zinedine Zidane has welcomed Gareth Bale back to Real Madrid despite the palaver over that golf flag. “He went to join his national team, he played and now we get him back again, and we’re delighted to have him back,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/22/there-is-a-lot-of-noise-over-gareth-zidane-welcomes-bale-back-to-real-madrid">mumbled Zidane</a>, while blood trickled from the lip he was biting.</p>

      <p>And Ole Gunnar Solskjær put on a passable impression of an unconcerned man when asked if he was bothered that Mauricio Pochettino has just been flung back on to the jobs market. “No, it doesn’t bother me at all because I’ve got the best job in the world,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/22/ole-gunnar-solskjr-i-feel-no-extra-pressure-at-manchester-united-after-pochettino-sacking">honked Solskjær</a>.</p>
