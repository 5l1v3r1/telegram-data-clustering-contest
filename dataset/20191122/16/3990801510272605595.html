      <h1>Finland prepares for cyberwarfare after receiving 235 Bitcoin ransom threats</h1>
      <h2>#Tietovuoto321 wants dat Bitcoin - or else</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:39:26+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:39</time> by <a rel="author">David Canellis</a></address>
      <p>Finland is preparing to defend itself against a mysterious activist group threatening to carry out cyberattacks — unless it gets some Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>More than 200 Finnish public organizations and municipalities have taken part in the drills. The scenario reportedly involves a hypothetical hacking crew demanding payment before waging various cyberattacks, <a href="https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/finnish_municipalities_agencies_brace_for_simulated_cyberattack/11081716">Yleisradio Oy</a> (YLE) reports.</p>
      <p>These measures are in direct response to threats made by an activist group calling itself #Tietovuoto321 (“data breach 321”), which sent Bitcoin <a href="https://partners.etoro.com/B9157_A72407_TClick.aspx">BTC</a> ransom demands to 235 public organizations across Finland on October 10.</p>
      <p>So far, government offices and towns have seen their websites and data systems come under simulated attack twice in the past month. A third practice day is reportedly scheduled for next week.</p>
      <p>YLE noted that participating organizations have responded “enthusiastically.”</p>
      <p>Ransomware attacks on public facilities and municipalities have increased in frequency over the past year, and not just in Finland.</p>
      <p>Hard Fork has previously <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/10/07/us-hospitals-pay-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-to-survive-ryuk-ransomware-attack/">reported</a> that several US hospitals hit by ransomware attacks opted to pay the hackers to recover their systems.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, hackers held computer systems belonging to Mexican state-owned oil firm Pemex to ransom for a gut-twisting <a href="https://thenextweb.com/security/2019/11/12/mexican-state-oil-firm-pemex-hit-by-ransomware-attack/">$4.9 million</a> worth of Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>It’s not all bad news, though. One ransomware victim recently <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/10/08/ransomware-bitcoin-hacker-cryptocurrency-muhstik-rekt/">exacted revenge</a> on his attackers by infiltrating infrastructure powering their malware, releasing thousands of decryption keys to help others recover their files for free.</p>
