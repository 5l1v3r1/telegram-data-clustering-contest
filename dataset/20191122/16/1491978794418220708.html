      <h1>Arsenal v Southampton: match preview</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:43:07+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/22/Guardian%20Staff" target="_blank">Guardian Staff</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery has his board’s public backing but that will surely wear exceedingly thin if Arsenal slip up against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton">Southampton</a> or, next weekend, Norwich. He may spring a surprise by recalling Granit Xhaka – a temptation given the thin midfield options at his disposal – but is more likely to use the bulk of the side that put in an improved performance at Leicester before the international break, perhaps reverting to a back four. A dominant showing is needed, for the first time this season really, against opponents who should be there for the taking. <b>Nick Ames</b></p>
