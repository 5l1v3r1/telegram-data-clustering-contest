      <p>School toilets in Wales are making a stink.</p>
      <p>Complaints from parents and pupils include teachers <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/newport-st-julians-school-loo-17281015">banning</a> children from going to the toilet during lessons, no <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education/kitchener-primary-toilet-paper-cardiff-17255824">loo roll in cubicles</a> and <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/treorchy-comprehensive-toilets-poo-bush-16994979">locked toilets.</a></p>
      <p>Pupils in around half of schools surveyed by education watchdog <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education/cantonian-high-estyn-schools-fairwater-16361370">Estyn</a> have also complained that their <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/newport-st-julians-school-loo-17281015">school toilets</a> are not clean, safe or working properly.</p>
      <h3>Here are the problems we've been told about by parents:</h3>
      <h4>Locked Toilets</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>A schoolboy had to poo in his school’s grounds because the toilets are locked during class time.</p>
      <p>The 12 year-old <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/teenager-aced-levels-despite-missing-13488918">Treorchy Comprehensive</a> pupil, who had a bad tummy, had no choice but to <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/treorchy-comprehensive-toilets-poo-bush-16994979">squat behind a school block</a> when he had to relieve himself in an emergency, his parents said. Treorchy Comprehensive confirmed toilets are locked during lessons.</p>
      <p>They said their son, who is in year eight, was given permission to go to the toilet by his teacher in a classroom five minutes' walk from reception.</p>
      <p>When the receptionist refused to give the boy a toilet key he was caught short as he went back to tell his teacher. Rushing back he could wait no longer and had squat down to poo behind a bush near a block outside.</p>
      <p>“He had diarrhoea and didn’t want it to run down his leg so he just had to find a quiet area outside,” said his mother after the incident in September.</p>
      <p>“This is a health and safety issue. He could not wipe or wash his hands.</p>
      <p>“We are very happy with the school and his reports are good but I am very shocked to hear about this toilet policy."</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the 1,644-pupil school said toilet policy would be reviewed “in light of the concern raised” by the boy’s parents.</p>
      <p>She added: “There are nine sets of toilets located across the school site and most of these are locked during lesson times to ensure all pupils have access to the highest standards of toilet facilities when they wish to use them, upon request.</p>
      <p>“The school has procedures in place which enables pupils to use toilet facilities during lesson times. These have proven to be effective over many years.</p>
      <p>Last year a school explained why it locked toilets during lessons, but changed the policy after complaints.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/ferndale-community-school">Ferndale Community School</a> sent out a letter to parents and guardians explaining why, after a number of incidents including vandalism and bullying, pupil toilets were locked during lessons.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/wales-schools">school</a> in Maerdy said the move was to keep pupils safe ,but several parents complained prompting the school to change the rule.</p>
      <p>Parent, Helen Raynor from women’s group Lleisiau Merched Cymru/Women’s Voices Wales, said: “Parents should be concerned that schools are not taking account of pupils’ views, and indeed of parents’ views.</p>
      <p>“Locks on cubicle doors that are missing or broken are also very concerning for <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education/pupils-missing-school-because-dont-15839558">female pupils in mixed sex facilities,</a> as we know female pupils are far more likely to experience sexual harassment and sexual assault in schools than male pupils."</p>

      <p>A mother complained her daughter was <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education/kitchener-primary-toilet-paper-cardiff-17255824">hospitalised with constipation</a> because of her school's policy of not putting toilet paper in the cubicles. Children had to take what they thought they needed from a dispenser in the public area before going to the loo at Kitchener Primary in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>The four year-old became unwell after becoming too anxious to relieve herself at school, her mother said.</p>
      <p>The school said it had placed toilet tissue in a dispenser in the public area to stop children taking too much paper and blocking toilets.</p>
      <p>It changed the policy after WalesOnline highlighted the story.</p>
      <h4>Mixed toilets</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>Some girls are missing school because they don’t like the growing trend of <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/new-school-port-talbot-mixed-15313425">mixed sex/gender neutral</a> toilets. They are staying at home when they have periods because of “period shaming” from some boys.</p>
      <p>Other girls are going all day without drinking water so they don’t have to use the facilities and some don’t use them because they fear sexual harassment.</p>
      <p>Some Muslim girls also dislike having to adjust their hijabs infront of boys.</p>
      <p>The findings from a consultation started by women’s group Lleisiau Merched Cymru/Women’s Voices Wales comes as growing numbers of schools are opening <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/same-sex-toilets-pupils-branded-disgraceful-6300626">mixed sex toilets</a> which they claim reduces bullying and are more inclusive.</p>
      <p>Single sex toilets are still available in schools with mixed facilities but are often further away from main areas of the building, said Lleisiau Merched Cymru/Women’s Voices Wales.</p>
      <p>Parents and pupils at a number of schools have complained about <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education/mixed-sex-toilets-schools-wales-15970191">mixed sex toilets</a> including Ysgol Cwm Brombil, Ebbw Fawr Learning Community and Bishop of Llandaff High.</p>
      <p>Ysgol Brombil parent Daniel Treagus wrote on social media that it was "well out of order".</p>
      <p>"My kids will be getting front door keys cut so they can use the house for toilet breaks," he added.</p>
      <p>"There are many problems with them. There are possible benefits but the problems outweigh them. Schools should be in the real world."</p>
      <p>Other parents have spoken in favour of the new toilets.</p>
      <p>Deborah Tucker said: "I can't see the problem - it is a great idea and it is working well in the other schools. "Embrace it. It's happening, is accepted and working."</p>
      <h4>Children not allowed to go out to the toilet during lessons</h4>

        <figcaption>St Julian's School, Newport</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Angry parents say their children’s school has banned pupils from <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education/kitchener-primary-toilet-paper-cardiff-17255824">going to the toilet</a> during lessons.</p>
      <p>Pupils at <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education/education-watchdogs-worrying-verdict-secondary-15755806">St Julian’s School in Newport</a> have been told they must go to the toilet at home or at break and lunch time.</p>
      <p>The 1,600-pupil secondary sent a message warning pupils that if they ask to go to the toilet during lessons the answer will be "no".</p>
      <p>The message said: “Please can I go to the toilet? If it’s period 1, 3 or 5 the answer will be no!.</p>
      <p>“Every time you leave lesson (sic) to go to the toilet you are missing out on learning.</p>
      <p>“Please ensure you go to the toilet at home, and then at break or lunch once in school.</p>
      <p>“Unless you have a pass your teacher will not let you out of their lessons P1 , P3 or P5 as these lessons are too soon after opportunities to already go.</p>
      <p>“Mrs Taylor monitors students who use the facilities during lesson time and passes on the names of frequent users to progress leaders.”</p>
      <p>The policy was branded unreasonable and a potential health and safety issue by parents.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/newport-west-hustings-gaffe-after-16006084">Mike Enea</a> , who has a 15-year-old son and a 13-year-old daughter at the school, said he is “horrified” at the “degrading” policy. As well as being a health and safety issue, Mr Enea added it could also have problems for girls on their periods.</p>
      <p>A council spokesman, speaking on behalf of the school, said: "Newport City Council works with schools to ensure the well-being of all pupils and this would include supporting young people in relation to access to toilets.</p>
      <p>But one former head teacher defended the move. Alun Thomas responding to criticism of the toilet policy said on Facebook: " Before you comment become a comprehensive school teacher just for one day! Enough said!!."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In a report published in the summer <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education/cowbridge-comprehensive-school-estyn-inspection-16453462">Estyn</a> found many other problems. The inspectorate's Healthy and Happy School Impact on Pupils’ Health and Wellbeing report found: "Pupils are critical of school toilets that are not accessible, clean or safe. "</p>
      <p>It also added: "Pupils in around half of the schools surveyed – mainly secondary schools – expressed <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/school-locked-toilets-during-lesson-14581064">concern about toilets</a> . Concerns raised included general uncleanliness, closed facilities, locks on cubicle doors that are missing or do not work, a lack of sanitary disposal facilities, no hot water or handwash, and unsuitable arrangements for transgender pupils.</p>
      <p>"Pupils have strong views about toilets, but schools have not always taken enough account of their views."</p>
      <p>Responding to the Estyn report findings Children’s Commissioner Professor <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education/school-bullying-wales-education-poverty-15903280">Sally Holland</a> said adults wouldn’t accept dirty toilets with broken locks and no soap in the workplace, so neither should young people.</p>
      <p>School leaders said they are aware of the problem and want to improve pupils’ loos, but don’t have the cash.</p>
      <p>Rob Williams, director of the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education/wales-139m-year-school-improvement-15763154">National Association of Head Teachers Cymru</a> , said:” “We are seeing issues, such as the maintenance and upkeep of toilets, becoming almost insurmountable as governing bodies continue to face increasingly severe cost pressures.</p>
      <p>“Estyn have rightly noted the issue, but it would be more use if they sought to understand and express some of the possible reasons why schools face these challenges.”</p>

      <p>Estyn’s report, published earlier this year, shows matters have not improved much since 2012 when a survey was carried out, and published, by the Welsh Government for its still used document - School toilets: Good Practice Guidance in Wales.</p>
      <p>At that time 48% of 1,786 pupils asked described school toilets as “really horrible” and 23% said they were “quite bad”. They complained of dirty toilets with no locks and lack of soap, among other things, reflecting problems still cited by pupils in 2019.</p>
      <p>Children's Commissioner Professor Holland added: “We really need to get the basics right: cleanliness, privacy and safety, working locks, adequate sanitary disposal and hand wash are all real basics.</p>
      <p>“We can’t have young people worrying about going to the toilet because it’s not clean or they don’t feel comfortable.</p>
      <p>“We can solve some issues by listening to pupils and taking their suggestions on board. They, after all, are the experts in school toilets.”</p>
      <p>The Welsh Government said it is the responsibility of local authorities and schools to ensure toilets are fit for purpose and suitable.</p>
      <p>A spokesman added: “The 21st Century Schools and Colleges Programme has already invested £1.4b in building and refurbishing schools and colleges over the last five years, with a further £2.3b being invested over the next phase.”</p>
      <p>Estyn said it surveyed pupils in 24 schools for its report, which also looked at other health and wellbeing issues from bullying to physical and mental health.</p>

      <p>The Welsh Local Government Association said: “Schools and governing bodies will have regard to the Welsh Government good practice guidance on school toilets. The 21st Century schools programme has been very successful in transforming the school estate in Wales and has enabled all local authorities to secure appropriate, modern, and pleasing learning environments for pupils to manage their hygiene and cleanliness.”</p>
      <p>“Authorities will focus on the challenges in this report, and will build on the very many positive messages around how schools are managing pupils health and wellbeing.”</p>
