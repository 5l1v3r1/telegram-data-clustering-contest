      <p><b>CALHOUN, La. (KNOE) - </b>Authorities say a Calhoun man has been arrested on several charges, including felony obscenity, after trespassing on someone's porch naked.</p>
      <p>According to arrest records, it happened on the morning of Nov. 22 on Cheniere Drew Road.</p>
      <p>The Ouachita Parish Sheriff's Office received a call that 30-year-old Nathan Urquiza was on someone's porch damaging vases.</p>
      <p>The victim told authorities that Urquiza was wearing no clothes and she could see his penis while he began banging on her front door.</p>
      <p>When deputies arrived, they say he approached them holding two cans of spray paint. They say he ignored commands to drop the spray paint and get on the ground. Urquiza was then tased and taken into custody.</p>
      <p>The report says that Urquiza was originally booked under another name after he gave a false name.</p>
      <p>Urquiza was booked on charges of criminal trespass, simple damage to property, obscenity, and resisting an officer.</p>
