      <p>Power for the Niva comes from a weedy four-cylinder gasoline engine that really reminds you why the car‚Äôs name in Russian translates to ‚Äúfield.‚Äù Nobody who has ever reviewed <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/lada-niva-will-get-new-generation-in-2018-just-four-decades-after-launch-115024.html">a Niva</a> has ever praised its power plant, even though other parts of the package are not as bad as you might think.</p>
      <p>Sure, you could swap out the factory engine for a more powerful and less agricultural sounding unit, but really the best thing you could do is give up on internal combustion and just turn it into an <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/e.html#ge-electric-vehicle"><u>EV</u></a>. Just like with pretty much any vehicle designed around a gasoline- or diesel-burning engine, the Niva can be converted.</p>
      <p>Want proof? Check out this video posted by Yuri Logvin on YouTube, dated way back in 2015, when EVs were just starting to gain traction. It‚Äôs literally the only video i could find on the entire platform that shows an all-electric converted Niva, at least the only one you‚Äôll find if you don‚Äôt search using the Russian keywords in Cyrillic alphabet.</p>
      <p>Its creator thankfully provided an English description next to the Russian-Ukrainian one below the video. He lists the car‚Äôs range as being 124 kilometers, its top speed 104 km/h and that it takes 7 hours to fully charge from flat. He also mentions that it comes with regenerative braking.</p>
      <p>The battery pack is out of a first-gen <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/nissan-leaf-priced-in-the-us-at-32780-18697.html">Nissan Leaf</a>, and in order to learn more about it you‚Äôre going to have to watch the video which thankfully has a good English subtitle.</p>
      <p>The conversion itself is pretty well done and the workmanship is by no means bad. The range is not great, but then again, the first-gen Nissan Leaf has a laughable range by today‚Äôs standards. The only real downside to this conversion has to be the fact that it surely affects the Niva‚Äôs factory-certified of 60 centimeters (24 inches) wading depth. üèÅ</p>
