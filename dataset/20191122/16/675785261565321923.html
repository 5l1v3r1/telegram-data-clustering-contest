      <h1>Man's childhood message in a bottle washes up just months after his tragic death</h1>
      <h2>New Zealand dad Ryan Mead tucked a message in a bottle when he was 12 years old, and just months after he died in a freak accident 25 years later- it suddenly washed ashore</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:54:04+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:54</time> by <a rel="author">Kelly-Ann Mills, Talia Shadwell, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/talia-shadwell/</a></address>
      <p>The family of a dad-of-two killed in a freak accident have been touched to receive a message from their loved one from 'beyond the grave'.</p>
      <p>New Zealander Ryan Meads was killed in March after inhaling fumes while laying carpets in the West Coast settlement of Greymouth in the country's South Island.</p>
      <p>His grieving sister, Leah Mead, told <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/117647025/message-in-bottle-washes-up-from-man-who-died-in-freak-accident-in-march#comments">Stuff</a> her 37-year-old brother was sorely missed by his family, after he left behind his wife and two children.</p>
      <p>Then one day, Ryan's parents were contacted by a stranger, Levi Johnson, who told them he had found a Coca Cola bottle washed up on a beach about 14km south of Greymouth.</p>
      <p>Inside the bottle was a note written 25 years ago by Ryan when he was just 12.</p>

      <p>It read: "If you find this bottle please right [sic] and tell us where and when you found it. Date 1/8/94."</p>
      <p>It also had a phone number for his parents house, who amazingly hadn't changed their number in all those years.</p>
      <p>Leah said her parents initially thought she had written the letter.</p>
      <p>She said: "I had a look at it and I was like 'it's not me, that's Ryan's hand writing'. I only have one brother so it is definitely his.</p>
      <p>"It's pretty special to have it. He passed away in March this year but I know he would have been quite stoked to get it back. He would have had a laugh about it.</p>
      <p>"The weird thing is about a month ago I was in the car and the song "message in a bottle" came on and I said wouldn't it be cool if you put a message in a bottle and it came back to you, then two weeks later we get this letter in a bottle from Ryan. It's crazy."</p>
