      <h1>Bolivia's interior minister accuses Morales of 'terrorism'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:00:20+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Bolivia's interim government on Friday accused Evo Morales of "sedition and terrorism" after the ex-president called on supporters to maintain blockades in the crisis-hit country.</p>
      <p>Interior Minister Arturo Murillo filed the complaint with federal prosecutors in La Paz, which has been choked by road blocks for weeks.</p>
      <p>"We are seeking the maximum penalty for sedition and terrorism," Murillo told reporters after filing the complaint.</p>
      <p>Bolivia abolished the death penalty in the 1970s. It is still technically available for treason, although the country's last execution was in 1974.</p>
      <p>Bolivia has been rocked by unrest and blockades since the disputed October 20 election that Morales claimed he won, but opposition groups said was rigged.</p>
      <p>Morales fled to Mexico after resigning on November 10. He has since accused Bolivian security forces of engaging in "genocide" against his indigenous supporters.</p>
      <p>Friday's move comes after Murillo played a telephone recording to journalists on Wednesday, allegedly of Morales issuing instructions to a leader of the opposition movement in Bolivia.</p>
      <p>"Don't let food into the cities, we're going to block, really encircle (the cities)," says the voice Murillo attributed to Morales.</p>
