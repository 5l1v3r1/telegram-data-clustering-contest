        <i>,” we take a look back at the many genre efforts from the 80’s, 90’s, and 00’s, exploring some shows that became cult classics, and others that sank in to obscurity.</i>
      </p>
      <p>This month we head back to the ’90s to revisit the original version of <b>“Ghostwriter”</b>!</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Aired from</b> 1992 – 1995</li>
        <li><b>Aired on</b> PBS TV, Fox Kids, BBC One, BBC Two</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I admit that when I was a kid I hated reading and one of the best ways to get me to crack open a book was to give it some kind of creative angle. I’d only read horror books or “Choose Your Own Adventure” tales most of the time. But PBS was very good about finding new fun ways to get kids reading. Along with “Reading Rainbow,” in 1992 the Children’s Workshop brought kids “<b>Ghostwriter</b>.” Originally premiering on Fox Kids, “Ghostwriter” followed a group of diverse young kids living in Brooklyn, New York. The series centered on the ensemble of children from various classes, their lives brought together thanks to the main character, Jamal. </p>
      <p>While preparing to bid goodbye to his sister, Jamal accidentally knocks over a book that unleashes a supernatural glowing orb. Said orb (that can change colors depending on mood) is a sentient being that can communicate only through words and soon seeks out Jamal for communication. Jamal happens upon a mystery involving a citywide crime spree of backpack thefts, all of which are connected to a group of gamers called THABTOs (or “Two Heads Are Better Than One”). When the thieves begin targeting various kids near Jamal, the orb (“Ghostwriter”) manages to help him foil the crime with his intellect and the power of reading and writing. </p>

      <p>Alongside Jamal, there’s singer and songwriter Lenni, brother and sister Lenni and Alex who help their dad at his bodega, aspiring filmmaker Tina Nguyen, and aspiring author Rob (who’d be replaced with the younger Hector mid-way through season two). As for Ghostwriter, he remains a mysterious being throughout the entirety of the series’ run. He has a power for building and assembling words, and can only really make himself seen to certain people. He can not however see, hear, or vocally talk to any of the characters, which can sometimes hinder his ability, but can also encourage the kids to use the power of writing and reading.</p>
      <p>“Ghostwriter” was a multimedia success, not only in its goal to help make writing and reading exciting, but in the way it also exposed the audience to a variety of races, religions, and classes, all of whom had something to contribute. The series never really discriminated when it came to spotlighting new characters, and spent much of its time with the small group of crime solvers and how they always stayed strong as a group thanks to their shared love for education. Despite the heavy lean towards education and promoting the beauty of New York’s diverse community, “Ghostwriter” held up as a great mix of the supernatural, mystery, and drama.</p>
      <p>Among some of the best mysteries, there was “Into the Comics” where Lenni encourages the group to enter a scavenger hunt to win an appearance in the comic “Hoodman.” Their efforts are sabotaged, however, by an angry, unidentified comic book artist. “Who’s Who” is an episode I found genuinely creepy as a kid, as Tina takes a job assisting a famous actress with her fan mail. It’s not long before she learns that she is receiving threatening and disturbing notes from an unseen assailant. Things get harrowing when the notes transform into genuine murder attempts.</p>
      <p>The series eventually introduced Jamal’s cousin Casey, who was apparently brought on to conjure a much younger vibe as various cast members aged or inevitably left. In one of the series’ most memorable (and final) arcs, Casey is struggling to come up with a short story for her creepy<b> “Gooey Gus”</b> doll, a large monster doll that can spew slimy gum.</p>

      <p>One of the most controversial aspects of “Ghostwriter’s” run was that it ended without ever explaining who or what Ghostwriter was. But producer and writer Kermit Frazier revealed in a 2010 interview with New York Times: “Ghostwriter was a runaway slave during the Civil War. He was killed by slave catchers and their dogs as he was teaching other runaway slaves how to read in the woods. His soul was kept in the book and released once Jamal discovered the book.” </p>
      <p>The original series came to a close in 1995 and never quite managed to pick up steam again, even in spite of efforts to reboot it with “The New Ghostwriter Mysteries” in 1997. It lasted only a season and had little to nothing to do with the New York born series. That said, “Ghostwriter” did manage to garner a lot of acclaim and awards from the WGA, and built an impressive list of guest stars including Samuel L Jackson, David Patrick Kelly, Spike Lee, Julia Stiles, Bo Jackson, Daisy Fuentes, Salt n Pepa, Dr Dre and Ed Lover, and so many more. During and prior to its run, PBS released a slew of merchandise including magazines, teacher’s guides, software, home video releases, and other educational outreach materials for children. There were also many “Ghostwriter” novels by Bantam released with original mysteries and novelizations of the TV episodes.</p>
      <p>Today the series holds up shockingly well with some truly engaging mysteries, sharp writing, and genuine performances from the collective cast. Plus, you have to love that theme song. It also remains one of the most celebrated kids’ series of the nineties, especially since it seemed to fulfill the purpose of turning many of its young viewers on to the excitement of reading and writing. With the (very loose) reboot/re-imagining currently running on the subscription service Apple TV+, hopefully it can inspire the new generation to seek out the original article.  </p>
      <p>After all, the new gen deserves to know who Max Mouse is.</p>
      <p><b>Is It On DVD/Blu-ray?</b> Thankfully the series isn’t very hard to find, as it can be viewed on Youtube. The VHS releases are still available for cheap while the insanely expensive DVDs are still in print. Here’s hoping the reboot will lead to a Blu-ray release of the original series.</p>
