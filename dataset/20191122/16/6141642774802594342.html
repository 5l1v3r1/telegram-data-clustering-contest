      <h2>BUSINESS leaders have been called upon to join a government pledge to put children first, as the Chief Minister vowed to ensure the Island’s past mistakes were not repeated when delivering child care.</h2>

      <p>Chief Minister John Le Fondré, speaking at an Institute of Directors event on Thursday, outlined the Council of Ministers’ objectives and said that Jersey is starting from a ‘poor position’ in terms of improving its standards of child care.</p>
      <p>He said that early initiatives to recruit social workers and foster carers had worked well but called for broader commitment within the Island to improve services, including from the business community.</p>
      <p>‘One of the most significant and enduring legacies of this government will be meeting our commitment to put children first,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘It’s the first overarching priority within the Common Strategic Policy and it remains the most profound responsibility of government to never allow a repetition of the failings that led to our children in our care suffering unacceptable abuse.</p>
      <p>‘We must meet that responsibility not just through words but through tangible actions. Although, we must all recognise that we are starting from a very poor position.’</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the government launched the Children’s Pledge – encouraging Islanders to support the government in delivering its aims.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘Last month our “Let’s be Honest” social worker recruitment campaign was recognised at a national level, winning the recruitment effectiveness award 2019 and perhaps most importantly is resulting in the recruitment of 22 new permanent social workers – that’s a massive boost in the capacity we have had in that department.</p>
      <p>‘Our fostering and adoption campaign has seen a doubling in the number of applicants in the past year. Last year we launched an eight-point pledge to put children first in which ministers, Members and public sector leaders committed to being accountable for improving the care and rights of every child in the Island.</p>
      <p>‘This campaign has ensured that children in our Island are cared for at the very highest standards. It’s a start but there’s so much more we can do.</p>
      <p>‘Yesterday, as part of World Children’s Day, we launched a campaign to encourage all public servants and Islanders to support that pledge, because we all have a duty to our Island’s children and it’s not just government. I hope all of you today will give support to that pledge.’</p>
      <p>The Chief Minister said that other legacies and challenges for his government would be dealing with Brexit and investing in public infrastructure after years of neglect.</p>
