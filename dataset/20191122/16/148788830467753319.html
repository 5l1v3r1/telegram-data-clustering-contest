      <h1>J.J. Abrams Responds to George Lucas’ Disappointment with ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:30:59+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/ethan-anderton/" target="_blank">Ethan Anderton</a></address>
      <p><b>George Lucas</b> giving up <b><i>Star Wars</i></b> in his sale of Lucasfilm to The Walt Disney Company in 2012 was undoubtedly a difficult thing for him to do. It probably got significantly harder when he learned that producer <b>Kathleen Kennedy</b>, director <b>J.J. Abrams</b>, and writer <b>Michael Arndt</b> <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/george-lucas-the-force-awakens/">would not be following</a> the new trilogy storyline he charted out long before the sale took place. So no one was surprised to hear that George Lucas was disappointed in <b><i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i></b>, but director J.J. Abrams says he doesn’t take it personally. And despite not having the same story Lucas envisioned for the future of <i>Star Wars</i>, he still made an effort to “adhere to some fundamental aspects of the story” after meeting with Lucas before <b><i>The Rise of Skywalker</i></b>.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/star-wars-jj-abrams-secrets-of-skywalker-912362/">Rolling Stone</a>, director J.J. Abrams was asked about how he felt after learning George Lucas was disappointed in <i>The Force Awakens</i>, as dictated in Bob Iger’s recently released book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QW2LHN4/?tag=film-20"><i>The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned From 15 Years as CEO of The Walt Disney Company</i></a>. Abrams handled it very diplomatically, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>“I’ve only had gratitude for George. It’s probably a complicated thing for him. To decide you’re going to sell this thing that you created, that was your baby, to anyone — that must be more complicated than signing a check and smiling about it. But he’s been incredibly gracious. He’s been super-generous.”</blockquote>
      <p>It’s not as if George Lucas hasn’t spoken with J.J. Abrams since seeing the movie. In fact, Lucas met with Abrams before they started working on <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>, and the two had an extensive discussion about ending the saga. Abrams recalled:</p>
      <blockquote>“He came over, we had a meeting when we first started working on this [new movie], talked through a ton of different ideas and stories, and heard from him what was important. And we’ve done nothing but try and adhere to some fundamental aspects of the story. It wasn’t a difficult thing to try and do. And again, he was really gracious. So I’m only grateful. Do I wish that [<i>Force Awakens</i>] had been his favorite movie of all time? Yes, I only wanted to do well by him. I would just say that I have nothing but profound respect for the guy and am still truly, even more so now, working on these movies in awe of what he created.”</blockquote>
      <p>It’s easy for some to brush off George Lucas nowadays, especially after the prequel trilogy was disappointing for so many fans. And let’s not forget that he wanted to dig even <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/george-lucas-star-wars-sequel-trilogy-plans/">deeper into the microbiotic world</a> of the Force after introducing Midi-chlorians in <i>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace </i><a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/j-j-abrams-talked-to-george-lucas-about-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker/">something that was discussed</a> (between Abrams and Lucas). But even so, that doesn’t mean Lucas is without valuable perspective and ideas when it comes to wrapping up the Skywalker in a satisfying way. Lucas started us on this journey over 42 years ago, and it only makes sense that he should have at least a small guiding hand in how it ends.</p>
