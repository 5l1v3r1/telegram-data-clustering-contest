        <b>Made in Oklahoma</b>
        <br/>
        <b>Writer-director Greg Coolidge returned to his home state to film his Thanksgiving football comedy 'The Turkey Bowl'</b>
      </p>
      <p>For Greg Coolidge, football and Thanksgiving go together like turkey and dressing, mashed potatoes and gravy and pumpkin pie and whipped cream.</p>
      <p>So, the filmmaker's newest release, the rowdy comedy "The Turkey Bowl," takes its name and concept from the informal football games played by families and friends around the country on the holiday.</p>
      <p>"There aren't a lot of Thanksgiving movies, and so we thought, 'Huh, this will be an interesting sort of take,'" said Coolidge, the project's co-writer and director. "Everybody I know plays in a turkey bowl. When I come back to Oklahoma, I play with my family, and my buddies in L.A., we all play a turkey bowl. ... So, it's inspired by true events."</p>
      <p>Penned by Coolidge and his writing partner Kirk Ward, the movie centers on Patrick Hodges (Ryan Hansen, “G.I. Joe: Retaliation,” “Veronica Mars”), a former small-town high school quarterback who has grown up into a high-powered Chicago businessman engaged to a politician’s daughter. Since he hasn’t returned to his tiny Oklahoma hometown in years, his friends trick him into coming back for Thanksgiving and convince to finish their Turkey Bowl, a matchup with their bitter crosstown rivals that was snowed out 15 years ago.</p>

        <b>Homecoming story</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lionsgate released "The Turkey Bowl" last week in select theaters as well as on digital and On Demand. Coolidge celebrated by doing a question-and-answer session at Harkins Bricktown 16 with one of the film's stars and his former neighbor: University of Oklahoma and Dallas Cowboys football coach Barry Switzer.</p>
      <p>"I was a football guy, grew up in Norman. Grew up down the street from Coach Switzer," he said. "We thought (it) would be a fun sort of story to talk about a guy who goes back to his hometown. ... It does have that kind of theme of going back home and realizing, 'Hey, these are my roots. This is where I'm from. Did I turn my back on it? Or did I not? Have I stayed connected?'"</p>
      <p>The movie's themes couldn't help but resonate with the director, especially when it came time to film scenes he had written that incorporated the BC Clark Christmas jingle or were set on the "Secret Sidewalk," a walkway next to Switzer's house.</p>
      <p>"The last day of the shoot, I thought, 'This is really fascinating for me, moved to L.A., became a filmmaker, doing movies and TV, coming back to my hometown to shoot something, wrote it for this moment in this place and got to do it. And it was really a great sort of spirit that it had to it,'" he said.</p>
      <p>A University of Oklahoma alumnus, Coolidge moved to Los Angeles 20 years ago to pursue a filmmaking career. He previously co-wrote and directed the 2006 Lionsgate comedy “Employee of the Month," starring Dane Cook, Jessica Simpson and Dax Shepard, and wrote and created the Universal Picture’s action-comedy franchise “Ride Along," starring Kevin Hart and Ice Cube, which he said may be getting a third installment.</p>
      <p>He likened his newest release to "Old School" meets "Sweet Home Alabama"<br/>"So, it has a lot of heart, a lot of humor, and it has a good message," Coolidge said of "The Turkey Bowl." "One of the things that we try to do as writers, coming from Oklahoma, living in a liberal place like California, is we try to create things that are equally good for red states, blue states, so none of that stuff matters. So, everyone's gonna think it's for them; that's sort of the trick."</p>

        <b>Coach co-star</b>
      </p>
      <p>Coolidge lensed "The Turkey Bowl" last year in Norman, Purcell, Moore and Oklahoma City, using the Oklahoma Film Enhancement Rebate Program administered by the Oklahoma Film + Music Office.</p>
      <p>"People talk about community theater, and what we say with this is we have community film," he said "When we did the parade down in Purcell - and Purcell was amazing - they brought out big monster trucks and bands were there. We had hundreds and hundreds of people show up. And it's great - everybody's in the movie."</p>
      <p>That includes his old neighbor Coach Switzer. Coolidge said he first worked with the Super Bowl-winning field general as an associate producer on writer director Max Burnett's 1998 football movie "Possums."</p>
      <p>"He did a phenomenal job. Max had written this great monologue, and he like, 'Should we give it to him?' And I was like, 'Let's just have Coach do his own thing,' so he kind of improvised the whole speech," Coolidge said. "When this movie came around, I was talking to Kirk ... and I said, 'Hey, we should go after Coach for this.' And he (Switzer) was like, 'Yeah, I did the last one; that was a good experience.' Then, this was a much, much bigger role for him. And he's fantastic in the movie. ... We just screened it in L.A., and everybody came out of the screening just raving about him."</p>
      <p>Since the R-rated comedy is an independent movie filming on a tight schedule and even tighter budget, he said casting the legendary coach had one downside.<br/>"It can be tricky with Coach, not because he doesn't remember his lines or hit his ... but 'cause once he starts telling stories, the entire crew, the cast, everybody stops. It's just like everyone wants to hear it, and then you're the director going, 'We really need to move on,'" Coolidge said with a grin. "He knows just the craziest stories, so that was the only tricky thing was having too much entertainment."</p>
