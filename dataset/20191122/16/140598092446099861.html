      <h1>Police force send out 'welfare van' to crime scenes so officers can take a break on long jobs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:08:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/phoebe-southworth/" target="_blank">Phoebe Southworth</a></address>
      <p>Police are sending out a special 'welfare van' to crime scenes so officers can have a cup of tea and keep warm and dry during long jobs.</p>
      <p>Hampshire Police Federation bought the transit van three months ago and it has been used dozens of times in the last eight weeks.</p>
      <p>On board is a toilet, hot drink facilities, a table and a microwave to rustle up some snacks. It was recently deployed to Portsmouth and Southampton.</p>
      <p>The move is part of a push to boost morale in the force, after a recent UK-wide survey by the Police Federation revealed that 67 per cent of respondents would not recommend joining the police and 87 per cent felt morale within the job was low.</p>
      <p>Large sprinter vans, coined 'wellbeing wagons', are also being used by<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/hampshire-constabulary/"> Hampshire Constabulary </a>to help keep officers in peak condition.</p>
      <p>They are parked up at police stations across the county and offer services ranging from blood pressure and cholesterol checks to sleep and diet advice.</p>
      <p>The force are also offering their staff psychological screenings to ensure they aren't suffering in silence and to root out those who need additional support. </p>
      <p>It is the first time this service has been offered to all frontline staff and officers in the UK, rather than only those deemed at high risk of suffering trauma - such as firearms officers and child sex abuse investigators.</p>
      <p>Employees are asked to complete an online questionnaire every two years and any issues flagged will then be fleshed out in a face-to-face interview.</p>
      <p>In the six months since the scheme was introduced, some 600 officers have been assessed.</p>
      <p>Deputy Chief Constable Sara Glen<b> </b>said her employees must not be regarded as "cannon fodder" and it must be recognised that they work in a "high trauma environment".</p>
      <p>She added: "They need to be protected. That's why we've needed to get far more proactive, so if we are showing signs of burnout we can get services in much quicker."</p>
      <p>The measure was introduced after a former officer revealed that his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder led to him having to leave the police.</p>
      <p>Keith Waller dealt with horrific road accidents, violence and suicides throughout his 19-year-career.<b>  </b>He was admitted to hospital twice after suffering episodes of PTSD, which led to him retiring in 2013, aged 54.</p>
      <p>The 60-year-old, from Bournemouth, said: "We need to talk about it. If you don't talk about it you end up in a situation like I was. I was no longer able to police. The screening can only be a good thing."</p>
      <p>The chairman of Hampshire Police Federation, Alex Charge, said:<b> </b>"It's really important we change that culture and we change that stigma. And people recognise, to use a cliche, that it's ok to not be ok.</p>
      <p>"The reality is all of our officers are in high risk roles. Every one of them will see horrible things.</p>
      <p>"It's so important that other police forces look at what Hampshire are doing so we can make sure we look after the people who look after our communities."</p>
