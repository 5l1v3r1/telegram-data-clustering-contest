      <p>A charity has been left counting the cost after FOUR break-ins in just two weeks.</p>
      <p>Thieves have repeatedly targeted Scotswood Natural Community Garden in Newcastle, stealing tools and leaving the charity with a repair bill of thousands of pounds.</p>
      <p>Finding it difficult to continue their work due to lack of resources, members of the initiative are now pleading for help.</p>
      <p>Sean Clay, the charity's manager, said: "It’s awful to feel that we are being targeted, we feel so vulnerable.</p>
      <p>"Many people who come along to our garden are vulnerable and see it as a place of sanctuary. Now after it has been targeted it has really upset everyone."</p>

      <p>Providing <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/education">educational programmes</a>, training and workshops to residents, the charity is at the heart of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/scotswood">Scotswood’s</a> community.</p>
      <p>Starting in 1995, the project teaches thousands of people of all ages, abilities and backgrounds about the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/environment">environment</a> while having a positive impact on mental health and well-being.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/charity">charity's</a> first break in occurred two weeks ago, when sheds were raided and power tools, drills, sanders and multi-tools were taken.</p>
      <p>After seeing what other tools were in the shed, two nights later the thieves returned and targeted the shed but failed to get in.</p>
      <p>However, through their attempt to get inside they caused over £200 worth of damage to the shed.</p>
      <p>Five nights later, the thieves came back with better tools and managed to successfully break into a tool shed, cut the locks off the other sheds and stole strimmers and other small power tools.</p>
      <p>After getting new locks and paying for the damages, the charity believed that the thieves wouldn't come back.</p>
      <p>To much devastation, last weekend the charity found the new locks cut off and their lawn mowers chippers were missing.</p>
      <p>Robert Milne has been volunteering at the community garden for over a year and is shocked at the thieves actions.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old said: “It’s shocking that people can steal from such a lovely place. I am really disappointed.”</p>
      <p>Following the break-ins the charity has found it difficult to fund fixing fences, locks, sheds and to replace tools.</p>

      <p>With the garden being located on an isolated site, it means the charity is vulnerable to crimes.</p>
      <p>However, local firm Armour Door Systems has offered to install security shutters and JCS Ltd has offered to install a CCTV system.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">Northumbria Police</a> has collected evidence and is trying to find those responsible.</p>
      <p>PC John Loraine said: “This is a much-loved community garden that is the heartbeat of the neighbourhood in Scotswood.</p>
      <p>“It is run by volunteers and they put on a host of events for local families and residents from the surrounding area.</p>
      <p>“They have been targeted four times in less than three weeks and the value of the goods stolen and damage caused is now in excess of £1,000.</p>
      <p>“Nobody has been arrested at this time but we are conducting extensive inquiries and have put a patrol plan in place in the area."</p>
