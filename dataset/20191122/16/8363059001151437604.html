      <h1>Three's Half Price Unlimited Data Offer is Back</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:15:01+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:15</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Pritchard</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this week we mentioned that Three's Unlimited everything contract had been discounted <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/three-unlimited-data-deal-18/">down to £18 a month</a> - which is a very good deal. That said if you weren't fond of that, the network has brought back the contract that knocks 50% off the first six months.</p>
      <p>That means you get unlimited data, calls, texts, and tethering (plus the usual Three bonuses) for £10 a month for the first six months. Then you pay £20 a month for the final 18 months, bringing your total up to £420 over the course of the two year contract.</p>
      <p>For reference the £18 a month deal would cost you £432 over the same length of time. Not such a huge difference, I know, but at least it means you won't wind up having to handle a price increase after a year. It'd cost you £456 if you discover the £18 a month plan isn't being repeated next year.</p>
      <p>You can head over to Three to <a href="https://store.three.co.uk/view/content/mbasket">enjoy this deal right here</a>, or you can <a href="http://www.three.co.uk/">head over to the main storefront</a> and see what other Black Friday bargains are available.</p>
