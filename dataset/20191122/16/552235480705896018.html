      <h1>Kieran Tierney leaves Arsenal mates Aubameyang and Lacazette stunned with training ground get-up</h1>
      <h2>The full back made a £25million move in the summer but the look on his team-mates face was priceless.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:57:52+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:57</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>It's not often a Scotsman leaves two of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/english-premier-league">Premier League's</a> best striker's shellshocked in training.</p>
      <p>But that's exactly what <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kieran-tierney">Kieran Tierney</a> did to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette on Friday.</p>
      <p>The left back made the summer switch to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> from Celtic and the 9 degrees celcius London weather clearly didn't bother him.</p>
      <p>The harsh winters of Wishaw - where he grew up - and Lennoxtown have clearly toughened him up for life in London.</p>
      <p>The same can't be said for Aubameyang and Lacazette who both grew up in France where the temperatures are generally a bit higher. </p>
      <p>And Tierney's decision to not cover himself in hats, gloves, snoods or wear a jumper or trousers during training left the pair a bit baffled.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang teased the Scotland left back on social media after training finished with a brilliant Instagram post of the strike pair that captioned: "@KieranTierney: With short sleeves and shorts.</p>
      <p>"Us: Daaaaammmmmmnnnn!!!"</p>

      <p>Tierney was regularly spotted during the coldest months of winter with short sleeves and shorts on during training with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> alongside skipper Scott Brown.</p>
      <p>The pair would even refuse to stick a jacket on when travelling to freezing conditions in countries such as Kazakhstan or Russia for European competition.</p>
      <p>It might take Lacazette and Aubameyang a little while longer to get used to that one.</p>
