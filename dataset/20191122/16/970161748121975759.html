      <p>Joker director Todd Phillips has shut down rumours of a sequel, so everyone can calm down.</p>
      <p>It’s not happening. At least, not yet.</p>
      <p>It was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/joker-director-set-earn-100million-sequel-confirmed-following-1billion-box-office-11189995/">recently reported that he and Warner Bros boss Toby Emmerich were in talks for a second installment</a>, also pitching origin stories for other DC characters.</p>
      <p>However, Todd said: ‘Here’s the real truth about a sequel. While Joaquin [Phoenix] and I have talked about it, and while touring the world with Warner Bros. executives – going to Toronto, and Venice, and other places – of course, we’re sitting at dinner and they’re saying, “So, have you thought about…?”‘</p>

      <p>He <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/todd-phillips-disputes-joker-sequel-rumors-no-contract-1202191289/">added to IndieWire</a>: ‘But, talking about contracts, there’s not a contract for us to even write a sequel, we’ve never approached Joaquin to be in a sequel. Will that happen? Again, I just think the article was anticipatory at best.’</p>

      <p>The director also admitted the idea of exploring the origin stories for other DC characters had previously been ‘shot down’.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve been at Warners for 15, 16 years,’ he continued. ‘We have two things in development at all times, not 40 things like some people. I’m not the kind of guy who goes marching in saying I want these 40 titles. I just don’t have the energy.’</p>
      <p>It doesn’t seem like the movie’s doing too badly though, considering it’s hit the $1 billion (£778 million) mark at the box office, making it the most profitable comic book movie ever.</p>

      <p>Not too shabby.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Joaquin, who starred as the terrifying villain, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/joaquin-phoenix-admits-feared-getting-locked-joker-role-agreeing-movie-11195228/">admitted he feared getting ‘locked into’ the role if a sequel was to happen.</a></p>
      <p>Speaking <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-13/joaquin-phoenix-joker-fan-theories-sequel-oscars">to the LA Times</a>, Joaquin explained: ‘I guess the fear was that you’d get locked into doing something repeatedly that you don’t really care about, that doesn’t motivate you or excite you.</p>
      <p>‘Part of the whole attraction to me [of Joker] was there was no expectation. I didn’t sign a deal to do [more movies]. It was a one-off.’</p>
      <p>Then he added the crucial caveat: ‘I wouldn’t just do a sequel just because the first movie is successful. That’s ridiculous.’</p>
