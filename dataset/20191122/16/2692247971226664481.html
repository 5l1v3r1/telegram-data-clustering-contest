      <p>The decision to purchase new construction comes after much deliberation and soul-searching, not to mention internet searching and day trips to various communities. But, even after whittling down preferred communities to the top one or two, a buyer might have 10 to 20 floor plans to consider.</p>
      <p>What are the best ways to navigate what can seem like information and stimulus overload? Here are a few tips on making this consequential decision of choosing your new home.</p>
      <p><b>Start with</b><br/><b>finances</b><br/>The smartest and easiest way to trim the list of choices is to secure preapproval on a home mortgage from a financial institution before falling in love with a layout. Preapproval typically only takes a few days. While you’re waiting for the letter from your lender, you can keep house hunting. If you don’t have a mortgage lender, the communities you’re visiting likely have a preferred lender who knows how to guide you through the process.</p>
      <p>A lender will give you the dollar amount up to which you’re preapproved to borrow and the approval letter is usually valid for 60 to 90 days. Wait until you have honed in on a community or two before getting the letter; once you have it, you can remove higher- or lower-priced floor plans from your list.</p>
      <p>Many builders and lenders suggest leaving some buffer room — that means not borrowing the full amount for which you’re preapproved. It’s no fun living in a beautiful brand-new home and being so “house poor” that you can’t afford to invite your neighbors over for coffee and cookies. You also may want to add options or change design features in your home while it’s under construction. Leaving yourself financial flexibility ensures that you can choose custom light fixtures or wiring, or even plan landscaping for the near future.</p>
      <p><b>How do</b><br/><b>you live?</b><br/>To help you pick a floor plan, builders will ask you questions ranging from the size of your family to what kind of entertaining you might want to do five years from now.</p>

      <p>Be sure to mention pets in addition to children, in-laws or regular visitors when speaking with your builder. Do you expect your house to be the “party house” or a quiet retreat? Does anyone in the household expect to work from home now or in the future? Knowing the answers to these and similar questions will help you choose between floor plans and decide on optional room configurations.</p>
      <p>At College Park by <a href="https://www.centurycommunities.com/find-your-home/california">Century Communities</a> in Mountain House, for instance, four distinct communities each have five floor plans to choose from, ranging in size from two to five bedrooms, from 2,000 square feet to nearly 3,500 square feet and priced from $574,900 to upward of $704,900.</p>
      <p>That means that buyers with a wide range of lifestyle needs can all find a place to call home in this thriving master-planned area. College Park homes offer options for casitas, covered patios, open concept living, or opportunities to swap out a dining space for a den or a den for an optional fifth bedroom.</p>
      <p><b>Prioritize the</b><br/><b>permanent parts</b><br/>Nothing is more permanent in your home than the actual architectural structure and floor plan. Model homes tend to look beautiful and often display some lovely design upgrades, but use your imagination with each floor plan you’re considering; picture each one stripped down to the basics.</p>
      <p>By doing so, you’ll avoid spending tens of thousands of dollars of your budget on upgraded flooring, for instance, when six years from now, you may wish you had a floor plan with flexible, main-level space. You can always upgrade the flooring one day. But you can’t usually add a first-floor space that transitions over time from game room to home office to private space for your now-10-year-old child who may attend college nearby.</p>
      <p>Even <a href="https://www.dividendhomes.com/">Dividend Homes</a>, which has two communities in Morgan Hill and is known as a high-end boutique builder, offers some wiggle room so that buyers can find the ideal floor plan. Their Valencia community in Morgan Hill, for example, includes Mediterranean-style attached and detached single-family homes, all with high-quality standard finishes plus luxurious upgrades and options.</p>
      <p>If you choose a larger home and opt out of custom backsplash designs and crown molding throughout, you’ll still get 5¼-inch baseboards and designer light fixtures in each home. Or, in Plan 3, choose three bedrooms and a spacious loft with a built-in media cabinet if four bedrooms is more than you’ll need over time.</p>
      <p>Remember, no floor plan is 100% perfect at all times. Predicting your lifestyle and preferences for flow — and knowing what you can and cannot live without — will get you as close as possible to perfect.</p>
