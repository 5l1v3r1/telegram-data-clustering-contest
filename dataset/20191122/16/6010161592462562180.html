      <h1>Xbox One Black Friday 2019: the best deals on consoles, games, Xbox One X, accessories and more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:44:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:44</time> by <a rel="author">Staff</a></address>
      <p>It’s just a week away from one of the biggest sale days of the year and we’re already looking at the best Xbox One Black Friday deals currently available! If you’re looking to finally grab an Xbox One, or just get some good discounts on Xbox One titles, you’re in the right place.</p>
      <p>While Black Friday is November 29, many retailers start releasing sales and discounts early, in an attempt to grab some extra money from consumers before their attention is pulled into a thousand different deals. We have the best deals for the Xbox One that are out so far and we’ll be constantly updating our Xbox One Black Friday hub with new deals, so you don’t have to worry about missing out.</p>
      <h3>The best Xbox One Black Friday deals so far</h3>
      <p>We’re seeing many retailers start to put some early Xbox One Black Friday deals live. Amazon had some <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/25/these-xbox-one-consoles-and-controllers-get-black-friday-discounts-early/">healthy reductions across Xbox One consoles and controllers</a> but now Walmart has this excellent <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/12/walmarts-xbox-ultimate-sports-bundle-kicks-off-black-friday-early/">Xbox One S Ultimate Sports Bundle for $300</a>. You can also get <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-game-pass">three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $1</a> right now, too!</p>
      <p>Depending on how desperate you are for an Xbox, though, you might want to wait just another week or two for the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/07/best-buy-black-friday-ad-reveals-amazing-console-game-deals/">Best Buy Xbox Black Friday sales</a>. They are going to give us an Xbox One X 1TB Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order Deluxe Edition Bundle for only $349.99. Or, the Xbox One S with one game will be $199.99. Decisions! Decisions! And that doesn’t include the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/01/microsoft-announces-pair-early-xbox-one-black-friday-deals/">first wave of Xbox Black Friday deals</a> announced by Microsoft last week.</p>
      <p>Something else surprising could drop on the day but we really don’t expect to see many better Xbox One Black Friday deals compared to that on the horizon. Until then, here’s what we have so far:</p>

      <h3>What Xbox One Black Friday deals are we expecting this year?</h3>
      <p>The All-Digital Edition will be just $149.99, while an Xbox One S 1TB with NBA 2K20 will be down to $199.99. As for the more powerful console, there’s going to be Xbox One X with <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/17/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-gameplay/">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> for only $349.99. Fallen Order has only just come out!</p>
      <p>We also know that a range of <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/01/microsoft-announces-pair-early-xbox-one-black-friday-deals/">Xbox One controllers will be reduced by $20 for Black Friday</a> thanks to an early Microsoft announcement. Many different colours and styles will be featured, including rare and limited editions. It’s pretty likely all retailers will follow this $20 off model, but some might offer an even deeper discount for Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Xbox game deals will be an interesting one to follow, what with the rise of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate over the last few months. Many Xbox One owners are turning to that subscription service as it offers a healthy library of titles to play – a number of which are brand new releases, too! Microsoft has also already confirmed, though, that <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/01/microsoft-announces-pair-early-xbox-one-black-friday-deals/">Sea of Thieves: Anniversary Edition will be 50% off for Black Friday</a>.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.vg247.com/current//2018/11/xbox-one-black-friday-game-pass-ultimate-deal-600x338.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>So, could some of the biggest Xbox One games get hefty discounts? Perhaps, though we’d actually expect Microsoft to continue pushing the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate service even harder over Black Friday. They’re already offered <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/24/get-6-months-for-the-price-of-3-with-this-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-deal/">six months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for the price of three</a> and now there’s a <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/11/save-250-360-three-years-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-can/">$1 for three-month offer for new Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members</a>. On Black Friday, you can expect to get an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate 3 month membership for $24.99.</p>
      <p>Outside of that, though, we should see some discounts on newly released Xbox One games. Titles like <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/gears-5-standard-edition-xbox-one/6255311.p?skuId=6255311">Gears 5 for $24.99</a> and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/forza-horizon-4-standard-edition-xbox-one/6255310.p?skuId=6255310">Forza Horizon for $19.99</a> will top Best Buy’s ad this year, while <a href="https://www.target.com/p/madden-nfl-20-xbox-one/-/A-54600225">Madden 20 for $29.99</a> will be a doorbuster for Target’s sale.</p>
      <h4>What about an Xbox One X Black Friday deal?</h4>
      <p>You’ll be able to get <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/microsoft-xbox-one-x-1tb-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-deluxe-edition-console-bundle/6350266.p?skuId=6350266">Xbox One X with Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order for just $349.99</a>. It’s not quite down to that dream $300 price point, but it’s still a terrific deal as Microsoft has been a little shy to discount its more powerful console in the past. With time moving on and the release of <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/28/xbox-all-access-project-scarlett/">Project Scarlett</a> approaching, it makes sense to see a significant Xbox One X Black Friday bargain.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.vg247.com/current//2018/11/xbox-one-x-black-friday-deal-600x338.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Remember, the super-console sells for around the $500 mark as part of a bundle. A $150 cut is more than reasonable and represents a solid saving on the Xbox One X console.</p>
      <h4>What was that about Project Scarlett coming out soon?</h4>
      <p>Microsoft recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/09/xbox-scarlett-120fps-8k-halo-infinite/">Project Scarlett will launch in ‘Holiday 2020’</a> with <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/09/halo-infinite-e3-2019-trailer-pc-scarlett-2020/">Halo Infinite</a>. The hype for their next-generation console is slowly building alongside the PS5. A year away may feel like a long way off, but it’ll come around sooner than you think!</p>
      <p>With that in mind, you might be hesitant to pick up an Xbox One Black Friday deal. That’s totally understandable. However, the looming release of Project Scarlett could also work in your favour as retailers might look to discount their current stock of Xbox One S and Xbox One X consoles considerably. And that’s where the biggest Xbox One Black Friday deals could reveal themselves!</p>
      <h3>What Xbox One Black Friday deals did we see last November?</h3>
      <p>Last year’s Xbox One Black Friday deals were wild, varied and a little underwhelming.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.vg247.com/current//2018/11/xbox-one-black-friday-game-deals-600x338.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Outside of the $200 Xbox One S consoles, there wasn’t much that really grabbed our attention. There were a few big name games that saw price cuts to the tempted $30 mark, so that was nice. We also saw Xbox One controllers get reduced, thankfully bringing them down to a more reasonable price for once!</p>
      <p>The Microsoft Store was good for digital game deals, though. As we’ve moved another year into the future and digital sales continue to grow, this could be an area that Microsoft looks to capitalise on for Black Friday 2019.</p>
      <p>Altogether, we’re pretty excited to see what Xbox One Black Friday offers are up for grabs in 2019. With the momentum of <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/22/xbox-game-pass-outer-worlds-subnautica/">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> behind them, the release of Project Scarlett coming soon and whatever moves Sony decides to make, it could be a fruitful time for buyers!</p>
      <h4>Wait a sec, what’s Black Friday?</h4>
      <p>If you’ve somehow managed to avoid it throughout your life you’re in for quite the surprise. Black Friday is an annual sales extravaganza that’s been happening in the US for a long time now full of mad rushes for bargains and ridiculous sums of money taken off top tech items. It’s considered the biggest day of the year for retailers as they go all out to attract buyers looking to treat themselves or prepare some early Christmas gifts for cheap.</p>
      <p>This year, Black Friday falls on 29th November 2019. However, the sales actually last for about 3 weeks surrounding that date – or even earlier in some cases! That’s why we’ve started to gather up the best Xbox One Black Friday deals now, in case anything especially exciting drops early. You’ll be able to find everything that comes out early or in the days after Black Friday right here.</p>
      <p>To see what the competition is up to, you can also check out our hub pages dedicated to the best <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/08/ps4-black-friday-deals-2019">PS4 Black Friday</a> deals and best <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/08/nintendo-switch-black-friday-deals-2019">Nintendo Switch Black Friday</a> sales. All will continually be updated over the coming weeks and Black Friday draws ever closer like the ominous retail monstrosity it is.</p>
