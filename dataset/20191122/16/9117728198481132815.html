          <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/Racing-point">SportPesa Racing Point</a> boss Otmar Szafnauer has said that they are keeping an eye on drivers such as Mick Schumacher and Nicholas Latifi for possible seats in the future.</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Racing Point’s current drivers are no doubt their drivers for the next few years at least, with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sergio-perez">Sergio Perez</a> signing a contract his year keeping him there until at least the end of 2022, while <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lance-stroll">Lance Stroll</a>’s father Lawrence Stroll owns the team.<br/> <br/>But that doesn’t stop Szafnauer from keeping track of the progress of those around for future reference, despite Schumacher being a <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> development driving and Latifi, who was reserve driver for Force India in 2018, tipped to step up from the reserve role and take <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/robert-kubica">Robert Kubica</a>'s seat at <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/williams">Williams</a> for 2020.</p>
      <p><i>“We have quite a few drivers in mind,” </i>Szafnauer said to <i>Speedweek.com.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“We look at how they beat each other in the junior series. We even wrote an analysis program in which we record all the results. Well, that does not allow a perfect judgment, but it’s a guide.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Everyone in the Formula 1 is watching attentively what Mick Schumacher is doing.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“There are some pretty good guys. We also had Nicholas Latifi in our car.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>With a future star in mind Szafnauer still has confidence in 21-year old Stroll’s ability behind the wheel of a Formula 1 car but says there are still areas to be worked on.</p>
      <p>Stroll is still only 21 years of age, and Szafnauer is happy with his development, but admits that tyre management is an area for improvement.</p>
      <p><i>“Lance Stroll is a smart guy, still very young. His starts really are a show,” </i>he added.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“But he is still learning, especially in tyre management. He had bad luck a few times.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“He usually starts well, as I said, but then two opponents get in front of him and he runs out of pace.”</i>
