      <h1>What's next for Beatrice and Eugenie after Andrew scandal - they'll have to 'focus on day job'</h1>
      <h2>Prince Andrew's two daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie will be affected by the drama surrounding his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:06:24+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:06</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Forsey, https://www.facebook.com/zoeforseymirror/</a></address>
      <p>It has been a disastrous week for Prince Andrew, and two people who will be following the scandal closer than anyone are his daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.</p>
      <p>The royal sisters, the Queen's granddaughters, have stayed well out of the drama surrounding their father but his sacking will have huge consequences for them.</p>
      <p>Beatrice, 31, and Eugenie, 29, aren't senior enough to be working royals so have day jobs alongside their charity patronages and campaigning.</p>
      <p>A royal aide has said they will continue to undertake a "small number of royal engagements each year" following the news that Andrew will step back down from his official work with the Firm.</p>
      <p>However their importance to the Royal Family could also become an issue, and Andrew has always "promoted" his daughters and pushed for them to have their own roles.</p>

      <p>A royal source told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7709971/Beatrice-Eugenie-defiant-display-amid-Prince-Andrew-scandal.html">Mail</a>: "The promotion which Andrew had hoped for in terms of his daughters taking on more duties will now never happen. They will have to focus on the day job."</p>
      <p>Beatrice works in finance and consulting, and she's currently the vice president of partnerships and strategy at software company Afiniti.</p>
      <p>Referring to her as Beatrice York, the company's website states: "Beatrice is responsible for the management of the strategic Afiniti partnerships as well as company growth through unique initiatives and client development.</p>
      <p>"Previous experience includes; associate at Sandbridge capital a small consumer focused private equity firm.</p>
      <p>"Business development associate at Sony pictures television. Beatrice began her career as a research analyst at a boutique private wealth firm.</p>
      <p>"She received a degree in History and History of ideas from University of London, Goldsmiths College."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile Eugenie, who married Jack Brooksbank last year and lives at Kensington Palace, works as a director at London art gallery Hauser &amp; Wirth.</p>
      <p>Both princesses are also involved with a number of charities and not-for-profit organisations they are passionate about.</p>
      <p>A different source told the newspaper there is "sense of everyone circling the wagons around the girls" and a feeling that they shouldn't pay for their dad's actions.</p>
      <p>They told the Mail: "The Queen is particularly fond of Beatrice and Eugenie, and she respects the way that Andrew and Sarah have brought them up. Even though you may feel that they made such a mess of their own lives, they have been loving co-parents. </p>
      <p>"The feeling is that everyone wants to protect them from this hurt and from further hurt, rather than dance on their father's 'grave'."</p>
      <p>They said that the Queen will continue to invite the women to Balmoral and claims they see her a lot in Windsor anyway.</p>

      <p>A royal expert believes Beatrice may pay the biggest price when it comes to her wedding, which is due to take place next year.</p>
      <p>In September the older York sister announced her engagement to Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, a multi-millionaire property developer who she has known for years.</p>
      <p>While many expected her to have a celebration similar to her sister's, Marlene Koenig believes this might have to change.</p>
      <p>She tweeted: "Beatrice's wedding will be collateral damage.</p>
      <p>"I will not be surprised if she has a rather quiet wedding, out of the public eye, with a few photos, no live coverage."</p>

      <p>Andrew famously loves the high life, however <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mystery-prince-andrews-lavish-lifestyle-20918743">mystery surrounds how he affords his lavish lifestyle</a> on an allowance from his mum.</p>
      <p>There is little evidence of him earning the money needed to support such expensive tastes and he’s never had a proper full-time paid job since he left the Royal Navy in 2001.</p>
      <p>Royal observers have often pondered how he manages to keep a home in Windsor – shared with his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson – and a £13million Swiss chalet in Verbier.</p>
      <p>It has seven bedrooms, a sauna, a pool room and a terrace – quite the pile for a man who receives a “basic” allowance of £249,000 from the Queen to fund his office at Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>His earnings are arguably topped up with a small naval pension of £20,000 a year.</p>
      <p>He attracted the moniker “Air Miles Andy”, indulging his penchant for private jets.</p>
      <p>He's been pictured with a special edition gold Apple watches and a new Bentley.</p>
      <p>Seen at golf courses and the resorts of St Tropez – the question remains: how does he afford it?</p>
      <p>The money given to him by the Queen comes from the Duchy of Lancaster, the estate that provides her with a private income.</p>
      <p>This year the duchy’s profits rose to £21.7million.</p>
      <p>Critics say that allowance has meant Andrew has largely relied on currying favour with the rich and the famous in return for access to royal events and accommodation.</p>
