      <p>The next generation iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max will have 6GB of RAM, according to a report from Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis and associates.<br/><br/>Following a trip to Asia to meet with Apple suppliers, Barclays has shared a research note outlining their expectations.<br/><br/>In addition to an increase of RAM from 4GB to 6GB, the new iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max will purportedly feature rear-facing 3D sensing and mmWave support for higher performance 5G. They believe the iPhone 12 will remain at 4GB of RAM but will get 5G support.<br/><br/>The analysts also addressed rumors of an 'iPhone SE 2'. They believe the product is still in the pipeline with production set to begin in February. The smartphone is said to resemble the iPhone 8 with a 4.7-inch display, Touch ID home button, A13 processor and 3GB of RAM.<br/><br/>It's likely that Apple will debut the new iPhone 12 in September but the 'iPhone SE 2' could arrive around March.<br/><br/>Please <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/iclarified/id388040325">download the iClarified app</a> or follow iClarified on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/iclarified"><b>Twitter</b></a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/iclarified"><b>Facebook</b></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/iclarified"><b>YouTube</b></a>, and <a href="https://www.iclarified.com/rss/rss.xml"><b>RSS</b></a> for updates.<br/><br/>[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/22/barclays-iphone-12-pro-likely-6gb-ram/">via MacRumors</a>]</p>
