      <p>TransLink has confirmed that 10 SeaBus sailings will be cancelled tomorrow as a result of the transit strike issued by Unifor, the union representing bus operators and transit maintenance workers.</p>
      <p>As part of the job action, the following 10 sailings will be cancelled on Nov. 23 in the morning and the afternoon:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li>The 6:47pm, 7:17pm, 7:47pm, 8:17pm, and 8:47pm sailings from Lonsdale Quay will be cancelled</li>
            <li>The 7:01pm, 7:31pm, 8:01pm, 8:31pm, and 9:01pm sailings from Waterfront will be cancelled.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>TransLink has been scaling back sailings on the busy Waterfront to Lonsdale Quay connector <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/11/01/seabus-sailings-cancelled-translink/">since Friday, Nov. 1</a>, when Coast Mountain Bus Company (CMBC) operators and maintenance workers represented by Unifor began job action.</p>
      <p>Ben Murphy, Senior Media Relations Officer, TransLink, told Vancouver Is Awesome in an email that the SeaBus isn’t permitted to sail without a minimum number of crew on board  as required by Transport Canada. Since there is a shortage of skilled workers who can operate the SeaBus, the <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/11/06/seabus-sailings-vanouver-strike/">transit authority knows in advance of how many sailings</a> will be cancelled. If someone is sick or on vacation, it relies on ‘flexible shifts who can cover absences.’</p>
      <p>On Friday, Nov. 22, the transit authority noted that, “Due to job action, Customers may experience reduced frequency on some bus routes today.” As a result, it has listed hundreds of cancellations in its Transit Alerts page. However, the SeaBus was not affected.</p>
      <p>The initial phase of the strike action <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/11/01/transit-strike-begins-union-talks-vancouver/">began on Nov. 1 at 8 a.m.</a>, with operators not wearing their CMBC uniforms and maintenance workers not doing overtime.</p>
