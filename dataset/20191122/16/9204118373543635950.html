      <p>Saint-Gobain (Courbevoie, France; <a href="http://www.saint-gobain.com/">www.saint-gobain.com</a>) has completed construction of its new facility in Largo, Florida. With this plant, Saint-Gobain Life Sciences celebrates another significant milestone of its €70-million global expansion program spanning seven manufacturing sites that will all be completed and operational through the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>The 80,000 -ft2 Largo, FL facility will become an additional manufacturing site of Saint-Gobain’s C-Flex tubing, molded connections and assemblies used in fluid management for biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Saint-Gobain will continue to produce C-Flex tubing and related product lines at its existing facilities in Clearwater, FL; Charny, France; and Bangalore, India.</p>
      <p>The Largo facility is the second of seven ongoing site expansions currently in progress by Saint-Gobain Life Sciences and was preceded by the Bangalore, India site expansion which has been operational since September of 2019.</p>
      <p>“This is an exciting time in our business,” said Jean Angus, CEO Saint-Gobain Life Sciences. “This is the execution of a multi-year plan to expand our global manufacturing footprint, which will enhance our ability to service our Life Sciences customers globally with redundant manufacturing facilities. We are increasing the regional availability of our products and our ability to meet customers’ growing demands.”</p>
      <p>Saint-Gobain is investing over €70 million through a 3-year period to increase manufacturing capacity by expanding or constructing new manufacturing facilities in Beaverton, MI and Largo, FL in the United States; Charny, France; Dublin, Ireland; Bangalore, India; Hangzhou, China; and Songdo, South Korea. “We recognize the responsibility we have to our customers and ultimately, their patients, to increase capacity and localize production, ensuring a reliable, global supply of our products to the Pharmaceutical industry,” said Benjamin Le Quéré, General Manager Saint-Gobain Bioprocess Solutions. All new facilities and expansions will be completed and operational through the end of 2020.</p>
