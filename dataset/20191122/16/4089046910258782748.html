      <p><b>OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (WVLT) â€”</b> Six women were arrested and $3300 of stolen merchandise was recovered outside an Oak Ridge shopping center, according to Oak Ridge Police.</p>
      <p>Officials said all the suspects are from Knox County. They face charges of theft, conspiracy, criminal impersonation, and possession of tools to interfere with anti-theft security devices.</p>
      <p>Three suspects also had outstanding warrants from other agencies.</p>
      <p>An investigator on patrol reported he noticed the suspects walk into Rack Room Shoes with empty bags. A few minutes later, the officer said he saw the same suspects run out of the business with what was believed to be stolen merchandise.</p>
      <p>A release from ORPD said, "We'd also like to thank the employees of the business who attended a recent Organized Retail Crime meeting and immediately notified our Community Resource Officer of the suspected theft. These arrests are a result of ORPD's data-driven and intelligence-led policing strategies to reduce retail crime."</p>
      <p>The release did not identify the suspects.</p>
