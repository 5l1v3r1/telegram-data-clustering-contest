      <p>EFFORTS to ring-fence money raised from parking charges in Westport to be spent on projects in the local area are continuing.</p>
      <p>Councillor Peter Flynn tabled a notice of motion at a Westport-Belmullet Municipal District (MD) meeting today (Friday) proposing that the funds collected be spent in the west Mayo electoral area on specific capital projects, footpath repairs, or flood relief measures.</p>
      <p>A similar matter had arisen in Kilkenny County Council, he said, and it was found that the money could be ring-fenced.</p>
      <p>Some members, however, were unhappy that the motion did not include the whole of the MD, with Achill-based Councillor Paul McNamara making the point: “You are ring-fencing Achill and Belmullet out of the money.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Flynn said he had no objection to amending his motion to extend it to the full MD.</p>
      <p>Under standing orders, a notice of motion cannot be amended.</p>
      <p>A new motion reflecting the amendment will be brought before the MD when it meets again next month.</p>
      <p>Councillor Flynn said when charges were brought in initially, it should have been ring-fenced to be spent in the local area, so when people pay they know it is going to be spent in the area.</p>
      <p>Councillor Brendan Mulroy said the matter required some clarification.</p>
