      <h2>Stakeholders attribute it to short supply and reduction in imports</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:05:03+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Raviprasad-Kamila-Mangaluru-122428/" target="_blank">Raviprasad Kamila Mangaluru</a></address>
      <p>The ‘chali’ (white arecanut) variety arecanut prices are on the upward trend in the market. Arecanut stakeholders attribute it to short supply and reduction in the glut of imported arecanut.</p>
      <p>According to Khandige Shankarananarayana Bhat, vice-president, Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative Ltd (CAMPCO), Mangaluru, the prices of ‘single chol’ arecanut (harvested a year ago) has shot up by ₹15 a kg.</p>
      <p>It was ₹275 per kg one-and-a-half months ago and now it is ₹290 per kg. The same grade commanded ₹275 per kg in November last year.</p>
      <p>The prices of ‘double chol’ arecanut (harvested two years ago) has been ruling at ₹300 per kg for more than a month. It fetched ₹305 per kg last year.</p>
      <p>The prices of ‘hosa adike’ (fresh arrivals harvested now) has opened with ₹235 per kg now, compared to ₹220 per kg during the same time last year, he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bhat told <i>The Hindu </i>that ‘kole roga’ (fruit rot disease), which hit the plantations on a vast scale during the 2018 rainy season, has resulted in the short supply of ‘single chol’ arecanut. The disease hit about 20% of the plantations in Dakshina Kannada this year, he said.</p>
      <p>M. Suresh Bhandary, managing director of the cooperative, said that the market trend indicated that there was no circulation of imported arecanut in the domestic market now like earlier.</p>
      <p>Consumers in North India preferred ‘chali’ variety for chewing and to consume along with paan.</p>
      <p>According to the Department of Horticulture, the ‘kole roga’ had hit plantations spread over 33,000 hectares in Dakshina Kannada last year (2018).</p>
      <p>Nearly 56,000 arecanut farmers in the district had sought compensation from the government for loss of produce due to the disease. It had hit the plantations on a vast scale, after five years. The total compensation to applicants had been estimated at ₹60 crore as per the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) guidelines.</p>
      <p>Patte Venugopal, an agriculturist from Patte village in Puttur taluk, told <i>The Hindu </i>that many arecanut growers have suffered a double whammy this year.</p>
      <p>As there was a delay in monsoon this year, many have lost the arecanut palms owing to scarcity of water. Later it rained heavily this August-September resulting in the return of ‘kole roga’ for the second consecutive year in some pockets of the district on a vast scale.</p>
      <p>“If I lost about 40% of the crop due to the disease last year, this year the loss is about 65%,” he said.</p>
      <p>S.R. Satishchandra, president, CAMPCO recently told a gathering of dairy farmers in the city that there are signs of ‘chali’ prices going up.</p>
