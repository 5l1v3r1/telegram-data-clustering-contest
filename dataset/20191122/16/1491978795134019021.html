        <i>From the Island Social Club comes this pineapple-scented, campari and vermouth concoction made with vodka instead of gin – a perfect fireside aperitif</i>
      </p>
      <p>Stirred drinks, with their bright, clear colours, make great winter cocktails. The pineapple in this one lends it a welcome touch of the warm tropics, although the drink itself was a total accident. While testing a negroni recipe, I picked up a bottle of vodka by mistake and ended up with this. You’ll need to steep the fruit in Campari at least three days ahead.</p>
      <p>Serves <b>1</b></p>
      <p>For the pineapple Campari<br/><b>1 small wedge fresh pineapple</b>, peeled, cored and cut into cubes (75-100g)<br/><b>150-200ml Campari </b>(depending on the size of your jar)<br/><br/>For the drink<br/><b>25ml good vodka </b>– we use <a href="https://www.ourlondondistillery.com/">Our/London<br/></a><b>25ml sweet vermouth </b>– we use Cocchi’s <a href="https://www.cocchi.it/en/wines/storico-vermouth-di-torino/">Vermouth di Torino</a>, but <a href="https://www.martini.com/products/martini-rosso/">Martini Rosso</a> will do<br/><b>25ml pineapple Campari </b>(see above)<br/><b>1 twist grapefruit peel</b> (or orange or lemon peel – something citrussy and sour, rather than sweet adds another layer to the drink)</p>
      <p>First make the pineapple Campari. Put the pineapple in a small sterilised jar, top up with Campari to submerge, then seal. Keep in the fridge for three days, shaking the jar once a day, then strain into a second sterilised jar and store in the fridge; it will keep for up to three months.</p>
      <p>For the drink, pour all the liquids into a mixing glass, add ice and stir to chill. Strain over ice into a rocks glass, garnish with a twist of grapefruit peel and serve.</p>
