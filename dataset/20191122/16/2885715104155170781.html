      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:59:34+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/sports-desk/" target="_blank">Sports Desk</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/virat-kohli/">Virat Kohli</a> was at his glorious best on Day 1 of the 2nd Test between India and Bangladesh in Kolkata on Friday, his unbeaten 59 taking him past 5000 Test runs as captain – becoming only the sixth captain ever to do so, and the quickest to the mark.</p>
      <p>Kohli got off the mark with a thick outside edge, but he soon brought out his repertoire of classic shots, even drawing applause from the opposition on occasion.</p>

      <p>Bangladesh bowler Ebadot Hossain, who got the wickets of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rohit-sharma/">Rohit Sharma</a> and Cheteshwar Pujara, was seen clapping after a particularly well-timed cover drive from Kohli’s bat pierced the field and flew to the boundary.</p>
      <p>The incident happened off the fourth delivery of the 17th over.</p>
      <p>Kohli finished the day at 59, with vice-captain <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ajinkya-rahane/">Ajinkya Rahane</a> (23) giving him company. India will be looking to extend their lead of 68 runs when play resumes on Day 2 on Saturday.</p>
