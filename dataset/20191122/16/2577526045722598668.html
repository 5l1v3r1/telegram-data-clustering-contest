      <h1>Looks Like Pokémon Go Developer Niantic is Involved with Settlers of Catan AR</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T16:10:40+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 16:10</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>Last month the makers of <i>Settlers of Catan</i> announced <i>Catan: World Explorers</i>, an AR game that promises to turn the entire world into a massive game of Catan. While the similarities to games like <i>Pokémon Go</i> are immediately apparent, fans have discovered that that game’s developer, Niantic, might have a closer involvement than first suspected.</p>
      <p>Last week a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/dyicxv/catan_world_explorers_tos_suggests_this_is_niantic/f81kmmy/">post on the subreddit</a> (via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/is-this-niantics-next-game/?fbclid=IwAR1lq2CpJ5NN3KACCtTuPSOpROpc7o1tkvhyc4zVIPhvJQcqHDaB6epxn6A">Techcrunch</a>) for Niantic’s first game, <i>Ingress</i>, discovered that the <i>Catan: World Explorers</i> website’s privacy policy leads users directly to Niantic’s own privacy policy. On top of that, another user <a href="https://imgur.com/1O686rS?fbclid=IwAR1P5COORFj0mybRkANGxETuNZTefGBixT1i6rRzhOX2oQlsamw_UpLmjm0">discovered</a> that a section of the website’s code made repeated reference to the developer.</p>
      <p>This doesn't mean Niantic is directly involved in development; our money would be on <i>Catan: World Explorers</i> using the developer’s Waypoint tech to plot out its world. We’ve reached out to Niantic for comment, and will update if any is forthcoming.</p>
