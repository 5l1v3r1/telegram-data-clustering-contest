      </p>
      <p>As my parents were not football fans, I had reached 20 years of age without going to a proper match, save for a schoolboy international at Wembley, in which the teenaged Steve Powell of Derby County, later to manage Burton Albion for a while, was playing.</p>
      <p>As a schoolboy myself I listened to Derby County commentaries on the radio, watched them on the TV and realised that Kevin Hector, especially, was a very special player.</p>
      <p>So when, as a young reporter with the old Burton Trader, I was told by the then editor, Steve Orme, that he wanted me to go along with him to watch Burton Albion in an FA Cup tie and write what we call in the trade a “colour piece” (an impression of the day, rather than a match report) I was intrigued. The great Kevin Hector was by now on Burton’s books.</p>
      <p>It was November 24, 1979, and Division Four Bury were the visitors to Eton Park for a first round tie.</p>
      <p>The Brewers had already got past Gresley Rovers, Sutton Town, Alfreton Town and Parson Drove United (they are in Cambridgeshire) to reach that stage. There were 4,501 in Eton Park that day and, frankly, the game itself was forgettableBury did a professional job. They scored twice in the first 20 minutes and killed the game after that.</p>
      <p>But I was hooked. I could hear what players were shouting to each other, I could hear what the managers were shouting and the moans and witticisms of the crowd.</p>
      <p>Non-League football was going to be, for me, the real thing. Who then could possibly have envisaged what has happened to Burton Albion since? Not me, but I liked it so much that I went back the following week, even though work did not require me to do so.</p>
      <p>I fondly thought for years that Hector scored in my second match but former Mail sports editor Rex Page’s wonderful book, Wellington Street to Wembley, which charts the first 40 years of the club’s history, from 1950-1990, informs me that an Andy Harrison hat-trick and a Jon Nixon penalty saw Albion past Enderby Town 4-1 in the FA Trophy.</p>
      <p>But back to that colour piece for the Bury game and a confession. As far as I know, I am still banned from the hospitality room at Eton Park. Just as well it’s not there any more.</p>
      <p>Watching everything and making notes, I spotted at half-time that the Mayor popped something warming from a flask into his tea. I thought that was a rather splendid idea on a cold day, so my article recorded the fact that it had happened.</p>
      <p>A couple of days later, Steve Orme informed me that the club chairman, Ben Robinson, was not at all happy that I had reported what the Mayor had put in his tea. I should have been more discreet about what I observed in the inner sanctum and I was no longer welcome there.</p>
      <p>I’ve never mentioned this to Ben. It was many years later that I first came to report on the club that I had come to love, in the last season at Eton Park, sat with Rex Page, Tony Bentley and Ian Hawkins in what we called the chicken shed at the back of the stand. Anyway, Mr Chairman, if you happen to read this, I hope I am forgiven!</p>

      <p>What times the Brewers were about to embark upon. That first season that I saw out, the club had just gone back to the Northern Premier League from the Southern and they finished fourth.</p>
      <p>Hector and Nixon had scored 16 goals each but, most significantly, as it was to turn out, winger Neil Warnock had scored six in nine games before injury curtailed his season.</p>
      <p>The following season, by the turn of the year, Ian Storey-Moore had decided he could take Burton no further, Hector had been lured back to Derby to try to help keep them in Division One, which he did, initially, and Warnock stepped in.</p>
      <p>He had left, briefly, to manage Gainsborough Trinity, but now he returned, as Rex Page put it, “like a Sahara sandstorm – tough, gritty and abrasive.” Things would never be the same again, as they say.</p>
