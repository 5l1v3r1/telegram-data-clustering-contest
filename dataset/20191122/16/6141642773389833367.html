      <p>Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson started her day in Glasgow, where she insisted she can still be prime minister despite a slide in recent polls for her party.</p>
      <p>She said “not a single vote has been cast” in the election and she was still in with a chance of leading the country.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Nigel Farage laid out the Brexit Party’s General Election policies, promising a “political revolution”, while Boris Johnson visited a hospital in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, and Jeremy Corbyn urged would-be voters to get registered on a trip to Stoke-on-Trent.</p>
