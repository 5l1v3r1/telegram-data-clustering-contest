      <p>Former ECW Champion <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/tommy-dreamer">Tommy Dreamer</a> thinks that <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/cm-punk">CM Punk’s</a> role as an analyst on WWE Backstage is great for the former WWE Champion, should he be ‘okay with his status’.</p>
      <p>Punk became a member of the WWE Backstage team in a move that sent shockwaves around the wrestling world and has gotten the attention of almost everyone in the pro wrestling community.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mandatory.com/wrestlezone/news/1154226-cm-punk-tommy-dreamer-wrestlemania-29?fbclid=IwAR2jnFjHBoV4F_idjjOsgWkhG2xzcG_ICSXv734NoLFJ3ggD4ScfGCs_S18">Speaking</a> about Punk on <a href="https://twitter.com/BustedOpenRadio/status/1197607384920854536">Busted Open Radio</a>, Tommy Dreamer gave his views on his return and tried to assess the mindset of the former WWE Champion when he was denied a main event spot at WrestleMania 29, when he faced The Undertaker.</p>
      <blockquote>“Someone said no [about Punk being in the main event of WrestleMania 29]. And if that is what means something to you, then yes, at that point in his life, he’s cool. And he’s pi***d about that."</blockquote>
      <p>Dreamer also added that Punk “never has to see” Vince McMahon and Triple H and that his role as an analyst is great for him.</p>
      <blockquote>“If CM Punk is okay with his status, great. If Vince McMahon and Triple H are cool with CM Punk’s status – ‘cause I am sure they had to sign off on it.”</blockquote>
      <p>He then went on to bring up his own WrestleMania experience, citing it as some of the “worst days” of his career.</p>
      <blockquote>“At one point, my match was scratched to give more time to Melina and Ashley Massaro and I was like, ‘Are you kidding me?’ And then Rob Van Dam checked out while we were going to the ring ’cause there was no Rob Van Dam or Sabu shirts, and the show was in Michigan. He was quitting the WWE as we’re walking down the steps to come to the ring, and I’m like, ‘Rob, please. We have to go,’ because I’m trying to wrangle all these crazy people.”</blockquote>
