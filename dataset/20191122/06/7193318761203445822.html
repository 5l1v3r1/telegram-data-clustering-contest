      <p>STILLWATER — Oklahoma State’s NCAA Tournament challenges have gone from one extreme to the other.</p>
      <p>And it’s only the second round.</p>
      <p>Third-seeded OSU opened against South Dakota State, one of the top defensive teams in the 64-team field.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the Cowgirls will take on Santa Clara, which ranks seventh nationally in offense, averaging 2.67 goals per game.</p>
      <p>OSU and Santa Clara meet at 1 p.m. Friday at Soni McAlister Field on the Southern Cal campus in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>“It’s a big challenge as far as when you try to put together your gameplan and how you’re going to execute,” OSU coach Colin Carmichael said. “South Dakota State, we knew coming in that they were a very tough team to score and create chances against.</p>
      <p>“Santa Clara is the complete opposite. They get lots of numbers into the attack and have two very special forwards.”</p>
      <p>What worked for OSU in the 1-0 win over South Dakota State is what must work against Santa Clara, Carmichael says.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want to change what we are and the shape we like to play,” he said. “We certainly respect Santa Clara, and we understand they have a lot of firepower. And we’ll make sure that within our shape, we’re doing things that can slow them down.”</p>
      <p>OSU’s Dani Greenlee has a 12-2-3 record in goal, and she’ll also need some assistance from the Cowgirl defenders.</p>
      <p>“Our back three have been really good all year, Kim Rodriguez, Ally Jackson and Elise Hawn. They’ve been really solid and tough to beat,” Carmichael said. “The issue we have back there is we don’t have a lot in reserve. They have to play huge minutes for us.”</p>
      <p>Greenlee has allowed just 12 goals with 53 saves in 19 games, including 17 starts.</p>
      <p>“She’s very calm, composed. She doesn’t get flustered,” Carmichael said. “I think that helps the back line remain confident, even when we’re under a little bit of pressure.</p>
      <p>“I think the strength of this team is our collective, and it’s gonna be a big-time group effort to keep Santa Clara quiet.”</p>
