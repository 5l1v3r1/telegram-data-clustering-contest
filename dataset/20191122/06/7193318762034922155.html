      <p>Oklahoma County's elected officials put off a vote Thursday on raising their own salaries "effective immediately" because of legal concerns.</p>
      <p>The three county commissioners, sheriff, treasurer, assessor, clerk and court clerk now make $105,262 a year.</p>
      <p>At issue is whether they legally can accept almost $13,000 more a year in salary now or after they are reelected.</p>
      <p>Officials voted 8-0 Thursday to strike from the budget board agenda any discussion and possible action on salaries.</p>
      <p>District Attorney David Prater had strongly urged officials to take no action until his assistant, the county's legal adviser, can issue an opinion on the legal issue. County Clerk David Hooten and at least one other official had asked Assistant District Attorney Aaron Etherington for her advice.</p>
      <p>Some officials complained the state auditor's office already has determined they can accept a partial pay hike now.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma County officials have gone without a pay increase for more than a decade because county commissioners wouldn't approve any. Now, because of a law change, all eight Oklahoma County officials — not just the three county commissioners — make that decision.</p>
      <p>The new law went into effect Nov. 1.</p>
      <p>Commissioner Brian Maughan said Thursday he was amazed that "they went around us to get the law changed." He said he had his suspicions on who was behind the change but doesn't know for sure.</p>
      <p>"I was prepared to vote no," Maughan said. "I think we're paid plenty of money for what we do. I'll never vote for a pay raise. I think when we've got all the things we've got to do around the county, that the last thing we need to be doing is giving ourselves a raise."</p>
      <p>Hooten faced some criticism Thursday for putting a salary hike item on the budget board agenda so soon after the law change and before the county's legal adviser had issued an opinion.</p>
      <p>The county clerk defended what he did, insisting that simply was a way to inform other officials about the change and to begin a discussion.</p>
      <p>"I think that ... sooner of later we need to discuss this in an open meeting," Hooten said. "And until somebody puts it on an agenda item, it's not going to get to get discussed. ... As you know, we don't discuss these things in private. ... We do it in an open venue to be as transparent as possible. ... That's the only way we do business here."</p>
      <p>He pointed out the county clerk's office administers the county's payroll. "I want to pay everyone the correct amount. And, therefore, I need the budget board to tell me what that amount is. And that is why the agenda item was placed on there," Hooten said.</p>
      <p>Among those in favor of a salary hike is the county's longtime treasurer, Butch Freeman.</p>
      <p>He said he plans to vote for a raise so he can pay key employees more so they won't get stolen by the city. "My employees are capped at what I make," Freeman explained.</p>
