      <p>#MeToo movement turned the wave in India with Tanushree Dutta accusing Nana Patekar of sexually harassing her on the sets of <i>Horn Ok Pleasss</i>. Soon, a lot of revelations were made with celebs like Anu Malik, Sajid Khan, Alok Nath amongst others being charged too. A wrath was faced by All India Bakchod (AIB) too when Utsav Chakraborty was accused, and now the comedian is opening up all about it.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview, Utsav shared why he remained silent all long if he says he’s innocent. On being asked to why he didn’t opt for a legal route, the comedian in a conversation with Free Press Journal revealed, “I didn’t have any means to approach legally since everyone had abandoned me. I didn’t have enough money to afford a lawyer. I had less than Rs 20,000 in my account. My source for payments also stopped responding.”</p>

      <p>Furthermore, he slammed the comedy Industry for not coming in his support. “Stand up is a very hypocritical community, everyone is a competitor. It is that sudden ascent to power for most of them. It is a very bitchy one, we love to see the others taken down. But it was about someone getting called out for stealing jokes, and not something like this. This woman, however, started doing stand-up on an open mic three days before she called me out,” Utsav shared.</p>
