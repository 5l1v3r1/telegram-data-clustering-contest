      <h1>Martial Arts: East Kilbride fighter channels his grief into first title win</h1>
      <h2>Jamie Gillies is celebrating after winning the Scottish Junior Muay Thai title in Ayrshire</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Thomson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-thomson/</a></address>
      <p>Greenhills fighter channelled his grief into a title winning performance at the Scottish Junior Muay Thai Championships.</p>
      <p>Jamie Gillies took home the Junior Novice belt from the event in Ayr last month after being called up as a last minute replacement to fight defending champion Rio Murdoch.</p>
      <p>And the 14-year-old upset the odds to take the crown in the 55kg category, coming back from losing the first two rounds to claim his first Scottish title.</p>
      <p>His victory comes after the deaths of three grandparents and Jamie's dad David explained how he has used that pain to push himself on.</p>
      <p>David said: "This sport has helped Jamie in a big way, as he was harbouring a lot of anger over losing three of his grandparents within the last two year, so that has helped channel that and give him focus and discipline.</p>
      <p>"The heart and determination he has, I couldn’t be any prouder to see him come back from two rounds down.</p>

      <p>"Jamie has put in 100 per cent to training and his dedication from the start of this year has completely turned his life around."</p>
      <p>Rio Murdoch, fighting for Ayr's Wossobama Gym, was due to face Logan James but he was forced to pull out of the fight due to unforeseen circumstances.</p>
      <p>But Jamie, who was noticed at his last fight by the event promoter, was offered the chance as a last minute stand in to take on a title shot fighting for EK Fight Gym.It was too good an opportunity to turn down and he had to gain four kilogrammes for the fight.</p>
      <p>Jamie said: "It's a dream come true. No feeling in the world beats it.</p>

      <p>"When I was down two rounds I looked down and saw the belt sitting with the judges. I knew I was there for one thing and one thing only - to win the title - and I used all that I had left in me to get it.</p>
      <p>"It was amazing."</p>
      <p>And now he has that belt around his waist, it’s given the St Andrew’s and St Bride’s High School pupil a desire to aim even higher.</p>
      <p>He added: “I want to go the rest of the year undefeated and get as many fights as I can next year to help me get into the trials for the Great Britain team.</p>
      <p>“I’d like to think everyone at EK Fight Gym and all my family and friends for supporting me and helping me get through it all.”</p>
