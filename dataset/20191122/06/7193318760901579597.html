      <p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Bernard M. Jones’ nomination for a district judgeship cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday without opposition.</p>
      <p>The full U.S. Senate now has two nominees for judgeships in the western district of Oklahoma. Oklahoma City attorney Jodi Dishman is the other. Jones and Dishman are expected to be confirmed.</p>
      <p>Jones, 40, would fill the vacancy created when U.S. District Judge Joe Heaton took senior status.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump nominated Jones on the recommendation of Sens. Jim Inhofe, R-Tulsa, and James Lankford, R-Oklahoma City. Jones was asked few questions at a Judiciary Committee hearing in October. However, he answered some committee members' questions in writing on topics ranging from abortion and gun rights to his ruling in an Oklahoma case about school vouchers.</p>
      <p>Lankford and Inhofe said Thursday that they expect Jones to be confirmed swiftly.</p>
      <p>“Bernard has demonstrated his deep understanding of the rule of law and the Constitution in his years on the bench, and I have no doubt he will bring those skills with him as District Judge for the Western District of Oklahoma,” Inhofe said.</p>
      <p>Jones has been a federal magistrate judge in Oklahoma’s western district since 2015; before that, he was a district judge in Oklahoma County, where he oversaw drug court and mental health court programs.</p>
      <p>Jones received his bachelor’s degree from Southern Methodist University and his law degree from Notre Dame.</p>
      <p>Responding to written questions from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, of California, the top Democrat on the committee, Jones said Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 abortion rights decision, was settled law.</p>
      <p>“Roe v. Wade is Supreme Court precedent of which all lower courts are bound,” Jones wrote. “If confirmed, I will fully and faithfully apply it.”</p>
      <p>Jones said the Supreme Court’s decision in 2015 that same-sex couples have the right to marry was also settled law. He said the same of the Heller decision that the Second Amendment gives individuals the right to possess firearms; the Hobby Lobby case, involving a corporation’s right to make faith-based policies; and the Citizens United case that gave corporations the right to make political donations.</p>
      <p>Jones told Feinstein he could not comment — because of pending or impending litigation — on questions about whether a court clerk could cite religious views in rejecting a marriage license to an interracial couple or whether a florist could refuse to provide services at an interracial wedding.</p>
      <p>Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, asked Jones about his decision, as a state judge, that the Oklahoma Constitution prohibited vouchers for disabled children to attend private schools. The Oklahoma Supreme Court later overturned Jones’ decision.</p>
      <p>Jones said he examined the state constitutional provision barring the use of public money at religious institutions.</p>
      <p>The “only question was whether the state voucher program violated that no-funding provision when used to fund education at a sectarian institution," Jones said in his response to Lee.</p>
      <p>"I looked at the language of the constitutional provision and determined that, reading the text on its face, the scholarship program violated the constitutional provision when used to fund education at a sectarian institution.”</p>
      <p>Jones said he did not create a new exception to the constitutional prohibition because he was bound to follow the text of the law and state Supreme Court precedents.</p>
      <p>“As I stated at the hearing, I ‘reluctantly’ found the scholarship program violated the state constitution, and I stayed my own ruling to allow the Oklahoma Supreme Court to clarify the law regarding the no-funding provision,” Jones told the senator.</p>
