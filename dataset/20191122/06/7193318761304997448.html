      <p>STILLWATER — Chris Harris Jr. has been known to talk to himself.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to fall. It’s going to fall.”</p>
      <p>After each of Oklahoma State’s three home games this season, Harris can be found with a basketball on the floor of Gallagher-Iba Arena. He’s shooting over and over, talking to himself at the same time.</p>
      <p>“As long as I stay in the gym, my shots are going to fall,” Harris said. “I feel close.”</p>
      <p>Four games into his college career, Harris has yet to find the shot that helped him become a four-star recruit. He’s made just 1 of 9 shots entering the Cowboys’ game Friday night against Western Michigan.</p>
      <p>But even with the shooting woes, Harris remains a vital bench piece as a freshman thanks to his defense.</p>
      <p>“He’s been able to focus on learning our defensive system and buying into being a valuable commodity in terms of depth in the backcourt, a guy we can trust on the floor late in the game,” OSU coach Mike Boynton said.</p>
      <p>Boynton has turned to Harris late in close wins against Oral Roberts and Yale. Harris was the lone freshman surround by veterans.</p>
      <p>The son of a basketball coach and nephew of former WNBA player Fran Harris, he’s been raised in a basketball gym. That brings some comfort to Boynton as he works to find a rotation.</p>
      <p>“It’s a trust factor that he’s going to make simple plays, he’s going to be in control, he’s not going to do anything to try to be a hero but he’s going to play within himself,” Boynton said.</p>
      <p>At South Garland (Texas) High, Harris was a sharp-shooting player alongside current Kentucky freshman star Tyrese Maxey. Harris was not as heralded on the recruiting circuit, so he learned to not be the main scoring option.</p>
      <p>But he was still dangerous. He’s proven capable of hitting shots. He shot 45.6 percent and averaged 18.6 points as a senior.</p>
      <p>For now, he’s found a way into the rotation based on his defense. The rest will come.</p>
      <p>“He’s going to be a really good player for us,” Boynton said. “But part of the advantage he has now is he doesn’t feel like he has to make all the plays because he’s experienced that before.”</p>
      <p><b>NOTE:</b> The AAU Texas Titans announced their three-star power forward Montreal Pena — an Arlington, Texas, native and teammate of other signees Cade Cunningham and Rondel Walker — has signed his national letter of intent with OSU.</p>
