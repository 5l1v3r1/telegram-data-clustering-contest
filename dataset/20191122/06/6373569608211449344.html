      <h1>Posh flats plan for rat-infested waterfront drug rehab centre site</h1>
      <h2>Developer wants to put six-storey apartment block on land once used at the Broadreach unit</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">William Telford</a></address>
      <p>Developers want to build a six-storey block of luxury flats on a patch of rat-infested Plymouth waterfront land once used as a drug rehab centre.</p>
      <p>Eden Land Planning Ltd wants full planning permission to knock down empty buildings formerly used by the <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/urgent-talks-held-over-broadreach-3051019">now-closed Broadreach organisation</a> at Richmond Walk, Devonport, and build a block containing 60 flats called Ocean Quay.</p>
      <p>But the developer has said it doesn’t want to put any “affordable” apartments into the scheme, saying it would not make it profitable.</p>
      <p>If permission is granted the “industrial” buildings on the site, which one neighbour had complained of being a breeding ground for rodents, would be torn down.</p>

      <p>In their place would be a new building, sitting near the cliff under the plush <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/business/penthouse-pad-best-views-plymouth-2265554">Leeward House on the Mount Wise former navy estate</a>, containing one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments.</p>
      <p>The block would have a range of photovoltaic solar panels on the roof, and, because of a flooding risk, would not have flats on the ground floor – but a car park there instead.</p>
      <p>Residential accommodation starts at the first floor and has been provided over five floors. The building varies between four and six storeys in height and has been designed to follow the topography of the cliff line behind.</p>
      <p>This means the first, second and third floor layouts are similar, with variations to the layout of the fourth and fifth floors in response to the cliff line.</p>

      <p>Documents submitted with the planning application said: “At this stage the proposed development proposes 100% open market properties with no provision being made for affordable housing. This decision has been taken on viability grounds.”</p>
      <p>Developers said: “Ocean Quay offers the opportunity to create a high quality, sustainable development which reflects the identity and character of Devonport.</p>
      <p>“The scheme has been sensitively designed to respect the local setting whilst delivering high-quality residential accommodation that addresses the specific constraints and opportunities of the site.</p>
      <p>“This project creates a unique place to live with stunning views over Stonehouse Quay. “</p>

      <p>The site is about 0.4 of a hectare and currently contains two double-storey buildings, about 6.75m high, with low a low pitch roof. A report to planners said they “have an untidy appearance that would benefit from redevelopment”.</p>
      <p>The site was a limestone quarry until the 1890s. From 1907 it was used as a timber yard, In the 1950s a warehouse was built. The site has resembled its current form since the 1980s.</p>
      <p>The two existing brick buildings on the Ocean Quay site were a Rodgers of Plymouth car yard for many years until in 2007, they were converted into a drug and alcohol treatment centre.</p>
      <p>The applicant purchased the site with the intention of developing it for residential purposes.</p>

      <p>The proposed development was designed by Grainge Architects supported by a project team which includes experts from AECOM and other consultants. The design process began in December 2018 with initial concepts being produced.</p>
      <p>A viability review accompanying the planning application for a 60 apartment scheme said providing 18 affordable units generated a negative land value of -£1,473,223 and was therefore deemed “unviable”.</p>
      <p>A revised appraisal which removed the affordable housing provision and the S106 costs also generated a negative land value, but of -£174,755, and a report submitted by the proposed developer said: “We are therefore of the opinion that the site is not capable of providing any affordable housing contribution on the site, and although the revised appraisal falls below the BLV, the applicant would be prepared to proceed on the basis that no affordable housing contribution is provided on the site.”</p>
