      <p>Halle Berry is shrugging off minor injuries sustained on the set of her upcoming mixed martial arts thriller, insisting it's all "par for the course."<br/><br/>Production on Bruised had to be postponed on Monday after executive producer Brian Pitt revealed the leading lady had been hurt in an action sequence.<br/><br/>"Halle got slightly injured in the fight," Pitt told NJ Advance Media. "She's tired. She needed a break."<br/><br/>However, the John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum star has since addressed the incident on Instagram, assuring fans she will be just fine.<br/><br/>Alongside a blurred photo of the Oscar winner beside an MMA octagon, she wrote, "Thank you to all the folks that have showered me with love since my injury."<br/><br/>"It's par for the course when you do your own stunts, and I wouldn't have it any other way," she added, before quipping: "Just know I'm far from tired. I'm wide awake...and just getting started! #BruisedTheMovie."<br/><br/>Berry stars as an MMA fighter who has to work her way back from ruin in the movie, on which she is making her directorial debut.</p>
