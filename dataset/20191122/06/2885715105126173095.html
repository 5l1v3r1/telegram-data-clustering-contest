      <p>The crew of a passenger ferry travelling to Ireland from France discovered 16 migrants of Middle Eastern origin stowed aboard in a sealed trailer on Thursday, all of them in good health, Irish police said.</p>
      <p>The 16 men were found during a routine inspection on board the ferry while it was travelling from the French port of Cherbourg to Rosslare in southeast Ireland, a spokesman for the vessel’s Swedish operator, Stena Line, said.</p>
      <p>Police said they believe all the migrants are adults, but are still seeking to confirm the age of one man who may be a juvenile.</p>
      <p>Staff on the ferry, with the assistance of the lorry driver, opened the trailer unit after the discovery and the men were brought to a private lounge where they received immediate medical and welfare care, police said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Immigration officers began processing the men under immigration legislation after the vessel arrived in Ireland at around 1440 GMT, it added.</p>
      <p>“This has been a traumatic experience for these men and they are being treated with sympathy and compassion,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>Police are examining the truck, which they said is owned by a local Irish based-company. The owners and the driver, a male in his 50s who has been a resident of Ireland for over 25 years are co-operating fully with the investigation, police said.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 23, the bodies of 39 people, all believed to be Vietnamese migrants, were discovered in the back of a refrigerated truck near London. Two people have been charged in Britain and eight in Vietnam over the deaths.</p>
      <p>Dutch authorities on Tuesday found 25 migrants stowed away on a cargo ferry bound for Britain shortly after it left the Netherlands.</p>
