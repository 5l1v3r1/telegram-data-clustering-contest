      <p>The Bose Home Speaker 300 with Amazon Alexa built-in, is already down to its <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">Black Friday price</a>. And actually that's a pretty big deal. Bose products really never drop in price, so seeing it hit its Black Friday price a good week ahead of Black Friday is a big deal. And you might as well jump on this one now.</p>
      <p>This is on sale for $199 right now and that's $60 off of its regular price.</p>
      <p>Bose Home Speaker 300 is the smaller of the two smart speakers that Bose has with Alexa built-in. The main difference between volume of the speaker, is the lack of a display. The larger Bose Home Speaker 500 has a small screen for album art. Which isn't super useful, so there's that.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>With the Bose Home Speaker 300 you're getting Amazon Alexa built-in. So you are able to stream music, from your voice. Alexa has support for a number of different streaming services including Spotify, Amazon Music Unlimited, Apple Music and much more. And if Alexa doesn't support your favorite music service, there's also Bluetooth available.</p>
      <p>The audio quality on this speaker is exactly what you'd expect from Bose. It's full sounding and also offers some really good mids and highs. The bass isn't super deep though, which might be a good thing for many people.</p>
      <p>It comes in two colors: black and silver. The silver color is silver for the speaker grates and then white for the rest of the speaker. Depending on your preference, the black might be the better looking speaker. It's more of a murdered-out black color. Which looks really nice on a wooden table next to your bed, or even on your desk at work.</p>
