      <p>ARLINGTON, Texas &gt;&gt; John Sherman has been approved as the new controlling owner of the Kansas City Royals, and his group plans to close its deal to purchase the last-place team from David Glass and his family next week.</p>
      <p>Major League Baseball owners voted unanimously today to approve the deal, which was announced Aug. 30 and was expected to be worth about $1 billion. Sherman and his local co-investors will become only the third owners since Ewing Kauffman founded the club ahead of the 1969 season.</p>
      <p>Sherman, 64, has lived in Kansas City for more than four decades, even after he bought a non-controlling interest in the Cleveland Indians. He founded, built and then sold a series of energy companies.</p>
      <p>“He had a three-year indoctrination with the Indians. The Indians are regarded to be a very well-run and obviously very competitive on the field organization,” baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said. “I think the opportunity to function inside a quality major league organization gives John a unique opportunity to take over in Kansas City, not miss a step.”</p>
      <p>Sherman’s equity in the Indians has been put in a trust, pending its sale, Manfred said.</p>
      <p>Kansas City went 59-103, its second straight 100-loss season. Ned Yost, who led the Royals to their second World Series title in 2015, retired as manager and was replaced by Mike Matheny.</p>
