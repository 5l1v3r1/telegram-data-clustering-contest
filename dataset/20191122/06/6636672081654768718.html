      <p>In  October 2018 Intel’s CEO wrote to customers apologising for the shortage of  CPUs which had been getting worse all through that summer.</p>
      <p>”We’re taking the following actions,” wrote Bob Swan, ‘we are investing a record $15 billion in capital expenditures in 2018, up approximately $1 billion from the beginning of the year. We’re putting that $1 billion into our 14nm manufacturing sites in Oregon, Arizona, Ireland and Israel. This capital along with other efficiencies is increasing our supply to respond to your increased demand. We’re making progress with 10nm. Yields are improving and we continue to expect volume production in 2019.”</p>
      <p>It was generally thought at the time that these moves would not be enough to cope with the growing shortages.</p>
      <p>This week, Intel has written another letter to customers. Here it is:</p>
      <blockquote>To our customers and partners,<br/><br/>I’d like to acknowledge and sincerely apologize for the impact recent PC CPU shipment delays are having on your business and to thank you for your continued partnership. I also want to update you on our actions and investments to improve supply-demand balance and support you with performance-leading Intel products. Despite our best efforts, we have not yet resolved this challenge.<br/><br/>In response to continued strong demand, we have invested record levels of Capex increasing our 14nm wafer capacity this year while also ramping 10nm production. In addition to expanding Intel’s own manufacturing capability, we are increasing our use of foundries to enable Intel’s differentiated manufacturing to produce more Intel CPU products.<br/><br/>The added capacity allowed us to increase our second-half PC CPU supply by double digits compared with the first half of this year. However, sustained market growth in 2019 has outpaced our efforts and exceeded third-party forecasts. Supply remains extremely tight in our PC business where we are operating with limited inventory buffers. This makes us less able to absorb the impact of any production variability, which we have experienced in the quarter. This has resulted in the shipment delays you are experiencing, which we appreciate is creating significant challenges for your business. Because the impact and revised shipment schedules vary, Intel representatives are reaching out with additional information and to answer your questions.<br/><br/>We will continue working tirelessly to provide you with Intel products to support your innovation and growth.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Michelle Johnston Holthaus<br/>Executive Vice President<br/>General Manager, Sales, Marketing and Communications Group</blockquote>
      <p>Why? There is endless speculation about this. Has the 14nm process had yield problems? Was the capex too little? Did the new capacity build take too long? Why can’t Samsung Foundry and TSMC take up the slack?</p>
