      <p>Melbourne Renegades all-rounder Sophie Molineux is the latest Australian cricketer to take a break from the sport due to mental health concerns. The all-rounder will not participate in Renegades’ Women’s Big Bash League (WBBL) clash against Melbourne Stars on Saturday. She will be replaced by Makinley Blows for the upcoming clash against Stars.</p>
      <p>This development comes days after Glenn Maxwell, Will Pucovski and Nic Maddinson stepped away from the sport citing the same reason. Cricket Australia has ensured that they’ll provide Molineux with all the support from their end to help the all-rounder get back to the game.</p>

      <p>“Sophie has made the decision to take a break from cricket and we are providing her with the support she needs,” Australia Women’s Team Doctor Pip Inge was quoted by Cricbuzz as saying.</p>
      <p>“The welfare of our players is a priority and we are proud of the brave decision by Sophie to step away from the game,” Inge added.</p>
      <p>Molineux has featured in all the ten matches Renegades have played so far in the season. Renegades coach Tim Coyle affirmed that the cricketer will be provided with ample time, space and the support she needs to get back to the sport.</p>
      <p>“Sophie knows her teammates and the Renegades coaches and support staff are always there for her,” Coyle said. “We’ll give Sophie the time, space and any support she needs.”</p>
