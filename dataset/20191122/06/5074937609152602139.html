      <h1>Church support deprived communities with Supplementary education</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:54:51+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:54</time> by <a rel="author">Opesika Tetteh Puplampu, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Akplabanya Sege, (GAR) Nov. 21, GNA – The Kingdom Lifestyle Mission (KLM) has rolled-out “Supplementary Education,” for the underprivileged children to support formal classroom work.</p>
      <p>Pastor Alex Gyasi, a Senior Pastor of Highway of Holiness Church in London who is leading the KLM project in Ghana said, Supplementary Education which offersed the pupils with extra class hours at the weekend can make a big difference in the pupils’ educational lives irrespective of their environment.</p>
      <p>He said, this initiative seeks to boosts the educational background of the child and as a result.</p>
      <p>He said the Church has received positive indications from schools globally to the benefit of the project, “we are making positive impact on the lives of the pupils, as a result, more pupils continue to enrol unto the programme”.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Ghana News Agency at Akplabanya, a fishing community in the Ada West District after interacting with about 200 children who were beneficiaries of the project, Pastor Gyasi said, "What we do is that we go and mobilise university students to go and teach the underprivileged children in the communities free of charge every Saturday.</p>
      <p>“We offer them transportations from their campuses to come, we provide lunch for both the Teachers and Children, support with all the stationaries, books every Saturday free of charge. The children are not charged”.</p>
      <p>“We have been doing it in Ghana, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Bulgaria and we are intending to expand the project even more in Ghana; we believe that Supplementary Education can make a big difference in the pupil's lives," he said.</p>
      <p>He said, the volunteers were given references, which after university, they could use as work experience.</p>
      <p>He said recruiting and getting the right core teachers to be consistent all year round to help every Saturday was their major challenge.</p>
      <p>The Highway House began in 2009 through feeding two homeless men in London and has ever since sheltered over 850 people from over 60 nationalities.</p>
      <p>It provides shelter for people from the most vulnerable groups in society including; those without recourse to public funds, the mentally ill and those who are recovering from treatment from hospital and would otherwise have been discharged unto the streets.</p>
      <p>This initiative has been in Ghana for about five years now and has supplementary education at some deprived communities in the country at weekends.</p>
