      <p>SINN FÉIN HAS revealed that Michelle O’Neill held on to her post as the party’s vice president with two thirds of the vote.</p>
      <p>The party initially refused to disclose how many votes O’Neill and John O’Dowd received in the race for the position.</p>
      <p>The outcome was announced on Saturday at the party’s Ard Fheis in Derry but the breakdown of the vote among party members was not, prompting accusations of a lack of transparency.</p>
      <p>Sinn Fein president Mary-Lou McDonald insisted the vote was in line with party procedures.</p>
      <p>“The result is known, you all know the result, the process is an internal one and it’s now concluded,” she said.</p>
      <p>However Danny Morrison, the party’s former publicity director, revealed the voting figures in a tweet on Friday morning.</p>

      <p>According to the post, O’Neill received 493 votes to O’Dowd’s 241, indicating she had taken 67% of the vote, compared to 32% for O’Dowd.</p>
      <p>Former Stormont education minister O’Dowd signalled his ambition to replace O’Neill in the senior leadership role in August.</p>
