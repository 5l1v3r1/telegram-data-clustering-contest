      <h1>Couture's game-winner in OT lifts Sharks past Knights</h1>

      <p>Logan Couture scored the game-winning goal and goaltender Aaron Dell provided a scintillating performance to backstop the visiting San Jose Sharks to a 2-1 overtime win over the Vegas Golden Knights on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Dell, San Jose’s backup goalie, made 37 saves — including four in overtime to earn his squad its seventh win in eight games.</p>
      <p>Couture provided the winning goal at 3:20 of the overtime frame, his fourth goal of the season. He was sprung on a breakaway thanks to a pass from Marc-Edouard Vlasic and snapped home a shot from the slot. The Sharks are 3-1 in overtime/shootout games this season.</p>
      <p>The goal finalized a fantastic goaltending battle, especially from Dell. He was crucial for the Sharks to be in the game despite being grossly outplayed. The hosts outshot San Jose by a 24-8 count through the first 31 minutes.</p>
      <p>Then, in the first minute of overtime, the goaltenders matched breakaway saves. Dell denied William Karlsson and then Vegas goalie Marc-Andre Fleury turned away Kevin Labanc at the other end.</p>
      <p>Despite the Golden Knights’ dominance through the first two periods, it was San Jose’s Timo Meier who broke the scoreless deadlock 86 seconds into the middle frame. Meier won a footrace to get the puck just outside his own zone and gain a step on the defender. He held off the check and from the slot slipped a backhander just inside the far post for his sixth goal of the season.</p>
      <p>Vegas was finally rewarded just before the midway point of the third period when Brayden McNabb tied the game with his second of the season. A sharp-angled shot rebounded all the way to McNabb at the left point and he fired from just inside the circle, finding the mark to make it a 1-1 game.</p>
      <p>Fleury made 27 saves for the Golden Knights, who had won two straight.</p>
