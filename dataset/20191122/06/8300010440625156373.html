      <p>ONTARIO, Calif. (KABC) -- Jaclyn and Chris Hoover know exactly how many days have gone by since their twins, Issa and Isaiah, suddenly entered their lives.<br/><br/>"We got a call 367 days ago," said Chris Hoover. "It's kind of a whirlwind when you get that call, running to Target and all the places to get diapers of every size because you don't know how big they are."<br/><br/>The Orange County couple had taken a leap of faith when they decided to foster the twins in the hopes of one day adopting them. They knew the risks and possible heartbreak involved after fostering a 19-month-old boy who was eventually reunited with his biological mother.<br/><br/>"So, it is a hard thing especially after going through that to have that fear in the back of your head. But we were obedient to what we knew we were suppose to do - loving these kids as our own from day one," said Hoover.<br/><br/>On Thursday, those fears were forever put to rest. The Hoovers joined other families at the Ontario Convention Center to cement their commitment and officially adopt their twins.<br/><br/>"It's amazing we actually brought them home from the hospital a year ago today and so this is extra special," said Jaclyn Hoover, the twin's mother.<br/><br/>During the ceremony, 120 children found their forever families, but in San Bernardino County there are still many more children in need of a home.<br/><br/>"At any given point in time, we usually have a little over 1,400 kids that are in need of adoptive homes," said Marlene Hagen, Director for Children and Family Services in San Bernardino County.<br/><br/>While adoptions happen year round, its only once a year that the San Bernardino County Children and Family Services hosts an adoption finalization celebration to gather family and friends to mark the occasion.<br/><br/>"It's amazing we actually brought them home from the hospital a year ago today and so this is extra special," said Jaclyn Hoover.<br/><br/>For more information regarding fostering a child in San Bernardino County, <a href="http://hs.sbcounty.gov/cfs/Pages/Welcome.aspx">click here</a>.</p>
