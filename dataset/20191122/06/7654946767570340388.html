      <h1>A milestone night for Islanders’ Brock Nelson</h1>

      <p>Thursday — Nov. 21, 2019 — will be a day Brock Nelson will cherish. His two goals didn’t just help the Islanders set a franchise record for most consecutive games with at least one point, but his heroics came in his 500th NHL game.</p>
      <p>“You remember milestones,” the 28-year-old Nelson said after the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/islanders-set-a-franchise-record-in-ot-win-over-penguins/">Isles’ gritty, 4-3, overtime victory over the Penguins</a> at Barclays Center. “First game, first goal and now 500th [game]. The way it played out, something you’ll remember for a while. Right now, it’s a big win for us, to kind of keep [the streak] alive.”</p>
      <p>It now sits at 16 straight contests (15-0-1) and counting. Nelson looked like he would be the hero in regulation, scoring a power-play goal with 4:52 remaining after winning the faceoff and beating Matt Murray. But the Penguins forced overtime with 29.9 seconds left on a Patric Hornqvist goal. Before the shootout was needed, however, Nelson notched his eighth goal of the season, beating Murray again, this time with an across-his-body backhand far side. He also won Tuesday’s overtime contest in Pittsburgh.</p>
      <p>“ ‘Nellie’ is good one-on-one. I just like his deception,” coach Barry Trotz said. “He threw a couple of moves in there and sold shot and froze the goalie. Three-on-three, he gets it. He’s understanding goalies and getting some better looks. He’s been huge in three-on-three for us.”</p>
      <p>Nelson has gotten hot at the tail end of this run, with four goals and five assists during his current five-game point streak. He’s enjoying the moment.</p>
      <p>“We’ve won a number of different ways now in this run,” Nelson said. “Looking back, you’ll remember it forever.”</p>
