      <h1>Daniel Stendel in surprise Hearts backing as Hibs star Stevie Mallan delivers insight into former boss</h1>
      <h2>Mallan linked up with Stendel at Barnsley and his training methods gave him a good idea of how the German likes to play.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/</a></address>
      <p>Daniel Stendel is in the running for the manager’s job at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> and their players can expect to be doing a lot of it if he gets the job, according to Hibs’ Stevie Mallan.</p>
      <p>The Scotland Under 21 international worked with the German, albeit briefly, while the pair were both at Barnsley.</p>
      <p>Stendel was appointed at Oakwell just a couple of weeks before Mallan made his return to Scotland. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> paid an undisclosed fee to bring him to Easter Road on a four-year deal in July 2018.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stevie-mallan">Mallan</a> made just nine appearances in total for the Tykes after joining from St Mirren the previous summer and was pretty much on his way back up the road by the time Stendel arrived.</p>
      <p>However, he was around long enough to form an initial impression of the former Hannover 96 boss and was struck by the intensity of his training, structured in order to get his players hunting the ball back in packs.</p>

      <p>Mallan has kept himself up to date on the fortunes of his former club after his time in Yorkshire and was able to see a decent amount of their games under Stendel before he left Barnsley last month.</p>
      <p>He was impressed with what he saw as they finished second in the table, winning promotion back to the Championship at the first time of asking and racking up a club record points total in the process.</p>
      <p>If Stendel does end up across the city turning his gegenpress philosophy in to a “Gorgiepress”, Mallan can see the potential benefits, although of course hopes Hibs’ change of manager proves to be the more successful decision.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I only worked with him for a couple of weeks - but even then it was evident it was just all about pressing and high-intensity running off the ball,” he explained.</p>
      <p>“We were always in groups of twos and threes pressing the ball.</p>
      <p>“And I watched a bit of Barnsley last season because I still have friends there and it was evident in their play.</p>
      <p>“They won promotion and it was just all high pressing, high running.</p>

      <p>“That’s obviously going to help Hearts. Both teams are changing managers and both teams are looking to get up the table.</p>
      <p>“I just hope we come out better!</p>
      <p>“He was rated highly down there, it was the same with Hecky [Paul Heckingbottom], who got them promoted as well.</p>
      <p>“I think a lot of the fans bought into the style of play Stendel brought in.</p>
      <p>“And I know from speaking to a few of the boys there they rated him really highly as well and a lot were gutted when he got the sack there.</p>
      <p>“Those first few days he came in the door it was all games, high pressing stuff, different to what I had the year before.</p>
      <p>“Every manager comes in with their own tactics, we have already seen that here with Jack, who has a different philosophy to the one Hecky had.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully that’s a positive for us and takes us forward.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Ross'</a> new philosophy at Easter Road will need time to be implemented and start having an affect on performances and results, of course.</p>
      <p>The new man has had three days to work his new players, having spent Monday making introductions and speaking to the media.</p>
      <p>And those three days have mostly been about putting smiles on faces rather than tactical demands on players.</p>
      <p>“He just tried to bring a bit of positivity into the squad because the past couple of months hasn't been too great,” Mallan explained.</p>
      <p>“There were a lot of games that we should have seen out that we failed to.</p>
      <p>“So I think he has looked to lift spirits, not change too much, too soon because he won’t want to confuse the boys before games.</p>
      <p>“He’ll start to bring in his own things over the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>  </p>
      <p>“But for now him and Pottsy [John Potter] have come in and told us they want us to win every game, like we should be, we should be competing in every game.</p>
      <p>“He has told us his door is open if anyone wants to go in and speak to him about what they can do to make themselves better and get in the team.</p>
      <p>“He is a good man manager and he is trying to get that across to the players that they can go in and speak to him at any point.”</p>
      <p>Spirits shouldn’t have needed that much lifting given the Hibees last outing. A 4-1 drubbing of St Johnstone at McDairmid Park sent them in to the international break happy, although the wait between that game and facing Motherwell tomorrow has been frustrating.</p>
      <p>“A lot of the boys said the break came at the wrong time,” said Mallan. “There have been times before where we might have felt it came at the right time for a break from the league.</p>
      <p>“But we were on a high and the players did amazing to beat St Johnstone 4-1. We just want to take that momentum into the game on Saturday.”</p>
