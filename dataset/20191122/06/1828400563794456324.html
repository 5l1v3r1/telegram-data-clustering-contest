      <p><b>READ MORE: </b><a href="https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/sport/football/fleetwood-town-boss-and-everton-fan-joey-barton-happy-with-goodison-park-cup-tie-1-10114880"><b>Barton welcomes Fleetwood's trip to Goodison Park for EFL Trophy tie<br/></b></a>Mellon will bring his Tranmere Rovers side to the club he guided into the Football League seven years ago.</p>
      <p>The Scot was Town’s first full-time manager and won two promotions during his four years in charge.</p>
      <p>And Cod Army head coach Barton believes that his close friend Mellon, the former Blackpool midfielder, should get all the credit he deserves for his achievements at Town.</p>
      <p>Barton said: “You’ve got to remember Micky took Fleetwood from being a non-league club to a League club. That’s something that will always be in the history of Fleetwood Town.</p>
      <p>“He was the first manager ever to do that, which is an incredible achievement, and one he should be incredibly proud of and will be.</p>
      <p>“Our fans will show him incredible appreciation on Saturday because he justifiably deserves that.</p>
      <p>“I know Mick really well. I consider him a friend and a good football person.</p>
      <p>“It will be strange on Saturday – it will be the first time we’ve been against each other in a competitive match, though we did play them in a pre-season friendly last season and won comfortably. We have a laugh and a joke about that.</p>
      <p>“It’s nice to see the people who have done so well for a football club get the acknowledgement. I’m sure our fans will show Micky they’re really thankful for the job he did here.</p>
      <p>“He’s a good egg and I look forward to beating him on Saturday!”</p>
      <p>Barton, who has a full complement to pick from, thinks Rovers have been somewhat of a sleeping giant.</p>
      <p>The Merseyside club have had successive promotions and Barton said: “It’s a big club, Tranmere. I’m old enough to remember them coming very close to getting in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>“Clint (Hill, his assistant) here has played in a League Cup final for Tranmere.</p>
      <p>“In many regards Tranmere are a huge club compared to Fleetwood, albeit they’ve had a tough spell and had to scrap their way out of the Conference. Micky’s been at the hub of that.</p>
      <p>“Back to back promotions are tough in any divisions and the Conference is notoriously difficult to get out of.”</p>
