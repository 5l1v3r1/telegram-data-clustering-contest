      <h1>Lack of accountability allowing bad behavior to thrive in sports</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:28:46+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:28</time> by <a rel="author">Phil Mushnick</a></address>
      <p>I don’t know how it works for you, but I’m held accountable for my words, actions and failures to act. Even when off the clock. Recently, after missing recycling night I was not just held accountable, I caught hell.</p>
      <p>But what would life be like if we were never held accountable, if we got away with everything?</p>
      <p>Consider that the Dolphins this week <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/mark-walton-cut-by-dolphins-after-allegedly-punching-pregnant-girlfriend/">waived RB Mark Walton</a> after his fourth arrest this year. His latest was Tuesday, an alleged 4:15 a.m. assault on a woman reported to be pregnant with his child. Walton, University of Miami man, was suspended for four games on Nov. 4 following three arrests this past offseason that led to the Bengals releasing him in April.</p>
      <p>In announcing Walton’s removal, Dolphins’ GM Chris Grier defied the law of such gravities: “We hold our players to a high standard and take these matters very seriously. We will have no further comment at this time.”</p>
      <p>Given that what he said about holding players to high standards is so clearly untrue, I don’t blame him for declining further comment. In one year, Walton was issued multiple “second chances.”</p>
      <p>And so we trip along, the latest in a relentless series of high-minded but thoroughly bogus and self-serving public claims.</p>
      <p>It must be nice — or at least very different — to be in a position to make, then escape unscathed, demonstrably false claims of sincerity and authenticity on your own behalf.</p>
      <p>Roger Goodell’s infomercial-like, act-now, don’t-delay pitch that Jets’ and Giants’ PSLs “are good investments” was issued a media pass. Rob Manfred’s cuddly declaration that kids are MLB’s top priority was not even met with media doubt despite only hard evidence to the contrary.</p>

      <p>And Mike Francesa’s career-long, 180-degree revisionist disregard and mistreatment of his spoken “truths” in daily, transparent service to his colossal self-regard went indulged by his bosses.</p>
      <p>Saturday at noon, roughly 36 hours after that helmet-bashing brawl at the close of Steelers-Browns became near-the-top national TV news, the student-athletes and their coaches from Michigan State and Michigan appeared eager to prove that Thursday night’s mayhem meant nothing to them.</p>
      <p>The game was packed with late hits — one that led to the ejection of an MSU DE — and all form of post-play incivilities and all-about-me immodesties that now barely separate football — a sport — from wild-eyed holy war.</p>
      <p>And while Fox’s Gus Johnson and Joel Klatt dutifully celebrated <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/foxs-joel-klatt-on-whos-really-no-1-defending-jim-harbaugh-tua-fallout/">Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh as a great coach</a>, the video refuted that claim as Harbaugh does what he and so many college coaches do — he needlessly, cruelly ran up the score, kicking an opponent when it was down and thoroughly beaten.</p>
      <p>With 2:33 left, Michigan led, 37-10, and had the ball, third-and-2 at the MSU 39. Kill the clock, right?</p>
      <p>Nah. With starter Shea Patterson still in — he’d already thrown for 365 yards — Harbaugh called a razzle-dazzle pass play for an uncontested TD and 44-10 final.</p>
      <p>And Johnson and Klatt claimed they loved it! What a great call!</p>
      <p>Earlier this season, Big Ten Network announcers Kevin Kugler and Matt Millen clammed up when Harbaugh, up 45-0 over Rutgers, called for a long, late TD pass to make it 52-0. What a champ.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s MSU-Michigan started as scheduled. Last year’s game at MSU was delayed to clear the field of holy-warring players, a mass-hassle that began when Michigan’s star LB Devin Bush, citing “disrespect,” decided he’d use his spikes to scrape away at MSU’s midfield logo.</p>
      <p>Later, from ESPN’s studio, Adnan Virk and Joey Galloway were delighted by that video.</p>
      <p>While Bush, now with the Steelers, played in Cleveland last Thursday, Harbaugh’s accountability for how he aids in the diminishment of his sport remains zero, and the Dolphins continue to hold their players “to a high standard.”</p>
      <h3>Promo graphics turning TV into obstructed view</h3>
      <p>Another thing about MSU-Michigan on Fox: After Michigan scored that late, rub-it-in TD, anyone with a feel for the game could predict trouble on the kickoff — all except those at Fox’s controls.</p>
      <p>Bingo, a post-tackle hassle. But it was quickly lost to Fox’s predetermined abandonment of play in favor of a full-screen promo graphic.</p>
      <p>As for another Fox graphic, there was a doozy late in Minnesota-Iowa, with Iowa up by seven. We now direct your full attention to absolutely nothing:</p>

      <p>“Iowa, under [coach] Kirk Ferentz, is 51-57 in games decided by eight points or less [sic].”</p>
      <p>Two free tickets to the annual Diet Ginger Ale Festival in Lambertville, N.J. to the reader who can explain the relevance of that one.</p>
      <p>Another: According to CBS, Sunday, Pats DE Deatrich Wise played with, gulp, “illegal hands.”</p>
      <p>Though the yellow full-caps “FLAG” logo was posted and we had heard the ref’s call of “Illegal use of hands,” CBS saw fit to post, “Illegal hands to the face,” as if “hands to the face” or nothing wouldn’t have done it.</p>
      <h3>Booger picks vapid vocabulary</h3>
      <p>Several readers have asked why ESPN’s Joe Tessitore and Booger McFarland both chose to say “high-pointing the football” — “jumping” for it — this past Monday.</p>
      <p>Answer: “Verticality” was given the week off. And “off week” has been replaced with the obediently parroted but incorrectly used “bye week.” But I just work here.</p>
      <p>McFarland, by the way, this week was subjected to unfair ridicule after his, “Games in this league are lost more than they’re won.” He’s correct: More games are now lost to penalties, mistakes of inattention and misconduct than to good play.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>As for that reporter who<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/reporter-claims-charles-barkley-told-her-i-dont-hit-women-but-if-i-did-i-would-hit-you/"> blew the whistle on Charles Barkley</a> for what was supposed to have been off-the-record, no matter how ugly:</p>
      <p>Why did she think that his opinion of presidential candidates is so sage and significant that she’d quiz him at any length on his changing choice? Given Barkley’s past, did she think he’s a credible voice?</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>During St. John’s two-point home loss on FS2, Saturday, Vermont’s Everett Duncan hit a pull-up, 2-point jumper. Jim Spanarkel, in one sentence, then said plenty: “Don’t see that too much, anymore, because of the 3-point line.”</p>

      <p>Reader Mike Elbaz claims Prince Andrew will soon be a studio soccer analyst on ESPN or Fox.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Jets-Skins, Sunday, included pregame and in-game claims that RB Adrian Peterson, now with Washington, is a slam-dunk Hall of Famer. Really? Lots of extra-tough stuff to overlook, including an NFL suspension for whipping his 4-year-old son raw.</p>

      <p>Mets media director emeritus Jay Horwitz’s latest, via Mets.com/podcast, is with Pat Mahomes Sr., father of the Chiefs’ star QB. In 1999, Mahomes was 8-0 for the Mets.</p>
