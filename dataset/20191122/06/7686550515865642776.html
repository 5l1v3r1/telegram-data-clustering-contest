      <h1>British Bake Off inspires Britain's kids - but many don't know pork comes from pigs</h1>
      <h2>New cooking school will bring weekly food education classes to primary schools across the UK</h2>

      <p>Trendy ingredients such as avocado and passion fruit are readily identified by over 50 per cent of youngsters, but almost a third are unaware that pork comes from pigs.</p>
      <p>Those were the findings of a study commissioned by Zanussi to celebrate its newly-launched partnership with the charity Cook School.</p>
      <p>Perhaps sparked by prime-time favourite the Great British Bake Off, the survey also concluded that one in five of those involved bake at least once a week.</p>
      <p>Seven in 10 have put together batches of cupcakes, with pizza, rice-krispy cakes and pancakes also topping the list of children's signature dishes.</p>
      <p>However, the survey of 1,000 youngsters aged between six and 11 has also revealed some alarming gaps in their basic knowledge of food and nutrition.</p>

      <p>When shown a courgette, 42 per cent mistook it for a cucumber and 19 per cent reported never having tried one.</p>
      <p>And while 86 per cent of those quizzed by OnePoll have visited a farm to see the link between animals and the food on their plates, two in five do not know that chips come from potatoes.</p>
      <p>Chris George, UK head of marketing for Zanussi, said: “Based on these results we can see that today’s youngsters are likely to be more engaged with food than any previous generation.</p>
      <p>“However, it is also clear there is a significant task ahead to ensure the fundamentals of food and nutrition, as well as sustainable eating, are taught early enough to allow healthy habits to form.</p>
      <p>"With this in mind, we are delighted that Zanussi and Cook School have teamed up to host weekly cooking classes in primary schools and in turn make a real, positive difference to childhood obesity, diabetes and food wastage."</p>
      <p>Ahead of the launch, Cook Scool's founder Amanda Grant viewed the findings that 80 per cent of children would like to learn more about cooking at school as "fantastic news"</p>
      <p>”The cooking school will bring weekly food education classes to primary schools across the UK," she said.</p>
      <p>"Children will be taught how to cook well-balanced, sustainable meals from scratch and educate their families on the importance of nutrition for long-term health.</p>
      <p>“By the end of 2020 we’ll deliver weekly Zanussi Cook School classes reaching 30,000 children nationwide to empower them and their families to make healthier and more sustainable eating choices."</p>
