      <p><b>T</b>he National Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) has said it will ensure that local government areas comply with the new minimum wage.</p>
      <p>Its President, Comrade Ibrahim Khaleel, said the N30,000 national minimum wage is a law that must be obeyed throughout the federation, adding that it is a must for local government administrators to obey the law.</p>
      <p>He added that the union would do everything to ensure that members at the local government level enjoyed the new wage as stipulated by the law.</p>
      <p>He said as one of the labour leaders that participated, from the beginning to the end of the negotiation, particularly on the consequential adjustment, the union has been in touch with the leadership of various states as things continued to unfold on the process up till the last minute when  the agreement was reached.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>He said:  ”We have passed it to our members and  alerted them through a text message, before our circular got to them, that this was the outcome of the agreement and they should prepare ground to engage various governments at their level, from local to state level, to make sure that this consequential adjustment is implemented as expected by all our members.</p>
      <p>“That is why our union is primarily concerned and worried about the viability of the local government as a system. There is no gainsaying that the system is sinking because of the constitutional encumbrances. This is because the level of encroachment of state government on the local government is already putting our members and the system at a disadvantaged position and unless and until we keep faith with the fight and struggle to make the system viable, certainly the future of local government is bleak. Strategically, we are in touch with the leadership of the union at various levels, that is the states and local governments.</p>
      <p>“I want to also say that it is as a result of our presence that our group, in the categorisation  of the salary structure, is even having an upper hand , you can see clearly that the category is divided into A and B , local government workers fall into category A which got the highest percentage in the agreement.</p>
      <p>Khaleel said the Organised Labour is supposed to demand for review of the minimum by 2021, adding that this is in accordance with the provision of the minimum wage act.</p>
