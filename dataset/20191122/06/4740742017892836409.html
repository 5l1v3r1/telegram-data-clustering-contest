      <h1>Shrewsbury Town finding momentum with 'demanding' captain Ollie Norburn - Inside Line on Bristol Rovers' opponents</h1>
      <h2>A detailed look at Saturday's opponents</h2>

      <p>Bristol Rovers make the trip to Shrewsbury Town on Saturday for their first League One game since November 2.</p>
      <p>Due to the FA Cup and a postponement, it feels a while since <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">the Gas</a> were last involved in a league match, but they do actually go into the trip to the New Meadow on the back of a win thanks to their 2-1 victory over Rochdale.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">The Gas </a>have been below-par in November but have not actually lost a game since October 22.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Rovers</a> currently sit 10th in the table, two points off the play-offs and eight points off the top two.</p>
      <p>Their opponents on Saturday sit one place and one point below them in the table, with both sides having enjoyed positive starts to the campaign.</p>
      <p>It is a far cry from 12 months ago when both sides parted company with their managers due to poor starts to the season.</p>
      <p>To get the inside line on a Shrewsbury side that have quietly achieved an impressive 12 months of results under Sam Ricketts, we spoke with the <a href="https://www.shropshirestar.com/">Shropshire Star's</a> Lewis Cox.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How has Shrewsbury's season gone so far?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pretty solidly. It's been a good start for Town, I'm pretty sure most would have taken 11th at this stage after a summer overhaul, almost entirely new squad and way of playing. They are also in the FA Cup second round and EFL Trophy knockout stages, so it's been decent on all fronts.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What's the mood like around the New Meadow?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The mood within the camp is positive as you would expect. Town are finding a bit of momentum, having lost just once in 10 in all competitions. Supporters can see a team that is growing together. Town have a very clear style built from the back, the solid base they are built on is excellent. Fifteen goals against is the third-fewest in the league but they have only scored 13. Sure, supporters want to see more goals, but for now it is yielding results.</p>
      <p>
        <b>We're approaching almost a year since Sam Ricketts was appointed manager, what sort of football do Shrewsbury play under him?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former defender Ricketts focused his summer business on improving the defence and making Shrewsbury hard to play and score against, and that is exactly what they are. They began the season 3-5-2 but have morphed into a 3-4-3, where the wide midfield (wing-back) players can either sit back into a defensive five or push on. The football can be seen as cautious but, again, if you don't concede goals you only need one to win.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are the side's strengths and weaknesses?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Defensively they are really excellent. They have four top centre-halves to pick for three positions, each of Aaron Pierre, Ro-Shaun Williams, Ethan Ebanks-Landell and Omar Beckles are excellent. They look to play with control, keep the ball moving and winning it back as soon as possible. I suppose a weakness is they don't score enough, but they have been creating more opportunities in the new system, so the hope is goal will flow more.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How is former Rovers midfielder Oliver Norburn currently doing?</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>He's done pretty well here. Norburn is very highly rated by Ricketts, so much so that he made him captain at the turn of the year. He is an important player in midfield, sets the top and is a real leader as captain. He is very demanding.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who is the player Bristol Rovers should look out for on Saturday?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dave Edwards is in a bit of form. The hometown hero has two goals in two games and three in eight, his first goals since returning to the club in January. The central midfielder will start in the advanced left of the 3-3-4-3, with natural winger Shaun Whalley, whose last goal was at the Mem last season, on the other side.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Are any players suspended/injured? If so, who will be the biggest miss?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Midfielder Sean Goss (knee/toe) and striker Daniel Udoh (knee) are out of this one but aren't long-term problems. The former is nice passer and good midfield option. Long-term Ryan Sears (ACL) is missing. Regular No.1 Max O'Leary - on loan from Bristol City - is back from an ankle injury but experienced stand-in Joe Murphy has done admirably.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Predicted formation and starting XI:</b>
      </p>
      <p>(3-4-3): Murphy; Williams, Ebanks-Landell, Pierre; Love, Norburn, Laurent, Golbourne; Whalley, Cummings, Edwards.</p>
