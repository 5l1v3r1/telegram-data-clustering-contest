      <p><b>Ahmedabad</b>: Stating that the economy is in a bad shape, former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor C Rangarajan on Thursday said reaching the USD 5-trillion Gross Domestic Product (GDP) target by 2025 is "simply out of question" at the current growth rate.</p>
      <p>Soon after assuming office for the second term in May, the Narendra Modi-led government set a target of taking the economy to USD 5 trillion over the next five years. But there have been several clouds over the economy since, leading many to question the maintainability of the target.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Today our economy is about USD 2.7 trillion and we are talking about doubling this over the next five years at USD 5 trillion. The required rate of growth to achieve that level is in excess of 9 per cent per annum. Reaching USD 5 trillion by 2025 is simply out of question," Rangarajan said.</p>
      <p>"You have lost two years. This year it is going to be under-6 per cent growth and next year it may be about 7 per cent. Thereafter, the economy may pick up," he said, addressing a function organised by IBS-ICFAI Business School.</p>
      <p>Rangarajan added if at all the GDP becomes a USD 5-trillion gorilla, India's per capita income will grow USD 3,600 (around Rs 2.58 lakh) up from the present USD 1,800 (around Rs 1.29 lakh), leaving us still in the low-middle income country bracket.</p>
      <p>"The definition of a developed country is one whose per capita income is USD 12,000 (around Rs 8.6 lakh). It will take 22 years for us to reach that level provided we grow at 9 per cent per annum," the former central banker said.</p>
      <p>The economy has been on a steady decline, with growth rate slowing from 8.2 per cent in FY16 to 6.8 per cent in FY19. While the first quarter growth slipped to a six-year low of 5 per cent, the best forecast for the second quarter is 4.3 per cent. Even the RBI has lowered its growth full year forecast by a full 9o bps in two months to 6.1 per cent in its October policy review.</p>
