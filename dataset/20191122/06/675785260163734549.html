      <h1>UK weather: Met Office warning as 'two weeks of rain to fall in 30 hours'</h1>
      <h2>A deluge is expected today and tomorrow, bringing flooding, transport issues and powercuts. More rivers are expected to burst this weekend as Britain is gripped by wet weather</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:44:24+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:44</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>The Met Office has warned that almost two weeks of rain could fall over a 30-hour period.</p>
      <p>A rain warning has been issued for south-west England, with powercuts and flooding expected.</p>
      <p>The worst of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> will take place between noon today and 6pm tomorrow.</p>
      <p>It comes after weeks of rain and flooding resulted in communities being cut off - and even a woman dying in Debyshire.</p>
      <p>The latest <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> weather warning states: "Showers on Friday morning will be replaced by more persistent rain during the afternoon and evening.</p>
      <p>"The rain will be heavy at times, lasting through much of Friday night and Saturday morning before slowly dying out during Saturday afternoon.</p>

      <p>"20 to 30 mm is likely to fall quite widely, and 40 to 50 mm may accumulate in a few places, most likely across the higher ground of south Devon."</p>
      <p>The alert warns that a few homes and businesses will likely be flooded and some train and bus services will probably be delayed.</p>
      <p>The average total rainfall in the UK for November is 121mm, meaning almost two weeks' worth could fall today and tomorrow.</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency has issued six flood warnings and 45 less serious flood alerts.</p>

      <p>The organisation's flooding forecast predicts: "Local surface water and river flooding is also possible in south-west England and south-west Wales... on Friday and more widely across parts of England and Wales on Saturday and into Sunday.</p>
      <p>"Local surface water and river flooding is also possible across parts of the south of England and possible but not expected more widely across England and Wales on Monday.</p>
      <p>"Land, roads and some properties may flood and there may be travel disruption."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Weather Outlook said: "(Today) rain spreads northeastwards and it turns drier in the south for a time.</p>

      <p>"Later on more persistent spells of rain spread across much of southern England and Wales. Eastern counties should remain dry. Temperatures in the south will be a little higher than recently but in the north it remains cold.</p>
      <p>"During Saturday heavy rain pushes northwards with drier conditions following into southern and central counties. Much of Scotland and Northern Ireland could stay dry until the evening.</p>
      <p>"Temperatures should be close to the seasonal average. Brighter conditions are likely on Sunday in the southern half of the country."</p>
