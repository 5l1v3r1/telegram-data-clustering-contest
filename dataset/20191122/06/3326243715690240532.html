      <p>Twitter has supported two-factor authentication (2FA) for a while, but the service always required you to include a phone number as an auxiliary form of identification. Twitter has now changed its 2FA system to remove that dependency. Here’s how that works.</p>
      <p>If you use Twitter, you should be using <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/two-factor-authentication/">two-factor authentication</a> (2FA). 2FA requires you to enter a password and use a secondary means of proving your identity: something you know – your password, with something you have, like a phone, security key, or authentication app.</p>
      <p>Up until fairly recently, most systems, Twitter included, made that a phone number. The problem is that techniques like SIM swapping are on the rise, making it possible for bad actors to hijack phone numbers as a means of spoofing identity. In fact, this very thing happened to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey a few months ago, which may explain the company’s decision to roll out this change for all users.</p>
      <p>That makes sending a text to your phone less secure than it used to be. So Twitter’s engineers have removed the requirement for you to add a phone number to your Twitter account as a secondary means of identification.</p>
      <p>Now you can use a mobile security authentication app instead. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605">Google Authenticator</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017">Authy</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lastpass-password-manager/id324613447">LastPass</a> and others offer this functionality. These apps generate one-time passwords that stay in lock-step with a server using an algorithm.</p>
      <p>Be advised that if you’re using a physical security key like the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/08/20/yubico-yubikey-5ci-iphone/">Yubikey</a>, unfortunately you’ll still need to fall back on a mobile security authentication app, at least for now, according to Twitter security engineer Jared Miller. He <a href="https://twitter.com/jcmi/status/1197649884645511168?s=20">explained in Tweet</a> that physical security keys are not supported outside of Twitter’s Web interface, and acknowledged it’s an imperfect solution: “We know this might not be ideal but we’re going to keep working on it!”</p>

      <h3>Wrapping it up</h3>
      <p>Removing 2FA from a dependency on a phone number provides Twitter users with an additional element of security that will make it harder for bad actors to take over Twitter accounts using nefarious means like SIM swapping. This may not be something that everyone needs to worry about, but at least now Twitter is making the option available to those who need or want it.</p>
