      <p>There are three choices. In no particular order, there are A Levels, a qualification that does not directly lead on to a job or a career but prepares you well for university and higher education.</p>
      <p>The second type of qualification is the vocational Diploma/certificate which is going to be known in the future as T Levels (Technical Levels). These types of qualifications will be delivered by colleges in an applied learning way – "learning by doing" – which are very similar to the vocational qualifications which are delivered now, but with a higher emphasis on work experience. More information on this will come out over the next year or so.</p>
      <p>The last choice is the apprenticeship programme where a person works for an organisation for four days a week and attends a college or training company for the other day of the week.</p>
      <p>There are lots of advantages and disadvantages to the choices above and which one suits you is very much up to you and your career ambitions.</p>
