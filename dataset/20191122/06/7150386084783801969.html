      <p><b>Jodhpur:</b> A 21-year-old boy from Jaipur has made history by cracking the Rajasthan Judicial Services exam 2018 in the first attempt, making him the youngest judge in the country.</p>
      <p>Speaking to news agency <i>ANI</i>, Singh thanked his family, teachers and well-wishers for the success.</p>
      <p>“I was always drawn towards the judicial services going by the importance and respect reserved for the judges in the society. I took admission in 2014 in the five-year LLB course from the Rajasthan University, which ended this year,” Singh told <i>ANI</i> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“I am elated with my success and I thank my family, teachers and all well-wishers for their contribution which helped me crack the exam in the first attempt,” he added.</p>
      <p>It must be noted that this year, the Rajasthan High Court had reduced the original age requirement for appearing in the judicial services exam from 23 years to 21 years.</p>
      <p>Singh feels that it was a good move as it would also help him help more people throughout his career.</p>
      <p>“I could appear in the exam only because the minimum age was reduced. Had it not been so then I would not have been eligible. I think it will benefit me because now I will get more time to learn and do more work and serve more people in my career because I joined at such a young age,” he stated.</p>
