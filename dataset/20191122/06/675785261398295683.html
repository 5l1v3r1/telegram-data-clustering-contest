      <h1>Man Utd board's reaction to Tottenham appointing Jose Mourinho</h1>
      <h2>The former United boss took the reins in North London on Wednesday morning when he signed a three-and-a-half year deal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:32:02+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:32</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>There was reportedly an "intrigued silence" in the corridors of power at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> upon the news that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> had appointed former Red Devils boss Jose Mourinho as their new manager.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/jose-mourinho-tottenham-hotspur-news-mauricio-pochettino-spurs-manager-transfers-a9210781.html">The Independent</a> claim that Mourinho would have used the same interview techniques, including producing a dossier of his ideas, to convince Spurs chiefs he was right for the job of replacing Mauricio Pochettino, who was sacked on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Mourinho did the same thing at United, where it all unravelled for him in December last year following a poor first half of the season and amid mounting unrest from players.</p>
      <p>Mourinho takes charge of his first Spurs game on Saturday when his new club go to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> in a London derby, and speaking at his press conference yesterday the Portuguese said he's up for the challenge of returning to the Premier League for a fourth spell.</p>

      <p>“I had a feeling I was going to get a club mid-season," he said.</p>
      <p>"I knew I would be in a situation where I would get only one or two days before my first game. I cannot come here and think it is about myself. It is about the players and going from a base of stability.”</p>
      <p>“These last 11 months (of being out of management) have been used to think and to prepare.</p>

      <p>"You never lose your DNA. You are what you are - for the good things and the bad things. I know in my career that I’ve made mistakes.</p>
      <p>“I’m not going to make the same mistakes. I’m going to make new mistakes. I’m not going to say I’m more fit. I was always fit.”</p>
      <p>Spurs' visit to West Ham kicks off at 12.30 GMT on Saturday.</p>
