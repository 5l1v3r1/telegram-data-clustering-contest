      <h2>Holt's side take on the Premiership champions at Parkhead with injuries wreaking havoc on his squad.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Robbie Copeland</a></address>
      <p>Livingston manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/gary-holt">Gary Holt</a> has admitted he has had to pull the boots back on to make up the numbers in training this week, with injuries ravaging his side ahead of Saturday's clash with Celtic.</p>
      <p>Holt's side famously emerged victorious over the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> champions at the Toni Macaroni Arena at the beginning of last month, but have since lost Nicky Devlin and Cece Pepe to injury, while Chris Erskine - who has been out since September - is expected to sit out.</p>
      <p>The growing personnel crisis was underlined when striker Lee Miller departed to co-manage Falkirk this week, leaving Holt perilously short of options ahead of his side's return to action.</p>
      <p>Nine years after calling time on his playing career, it remains highly unlikely that former Kilmarnock star Holt will make a Danny Lennon-esque return to the pitch - but the 46-year-old has admitted to getting hands-on in training in a bid to make up the numbers.</p>
      <p>“We had 16 players training on Thursday, two of those were goalkeepers and two were young boys who are out on loan elsewhere," Holt said, via Capital City Press.</p>

      <p>“I had to join in training on Monday and Tuesday, and last week as well!</p>
      <p>“We will probably have 16 players in total against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a>, perhaps 17 if we push it."</p>
      <p>It's a tricky situation for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/livingston-fc">Livingston</a>, who sit seventh in the Premiership after a recent dip in form took the shine off their strong start to the season.</p>
      <p>Holt's men haven't won in their five games since that victory over the Parkhead giants, but as he prepares to send his side out to emulate those heroics, he has challenged his players to rise to the occasion.</p>
      <p>“It will make men of us, that's for sure," he added.</p>

      <p>"We can either go toe-to-toe with them and make a game of it, or we can raise the white flag.”</p>
