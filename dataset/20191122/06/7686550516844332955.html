      <h1>Welsh jockey Richard Patrick enjoys big-race success on board Happy Diva at Cheltenham</h1>
      <h2>Haverfordwest-born rider claims victory in BetVictor Gold Cup for trainer Kerry Lee</h2>

      <p>Another big race success for a Welsh jockey came last Saturday when Richard Patrick rode Kerry Lee’s Happy Diva to victory in the BetVictor Gold Cup at Cheltenham, <i>writes Jim Beavis.</i></p>
      <p>It was richly-deserved compensation for what happened to the pair in the same race last year. The mare was brought down when going well four out, and Patrick broke his collarbone.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old conditional was born in Haverfordwest and came up through the ranks of pony racing and point-to-points. He’s attached to Lee’s Herefordshire stable, which has housed three of the last 10 Coral Welsh Grand National winners.</p>
      <p>She has three entered for the 2019 renewal, and there are eight contenders from Welsh stables. The overall standard of entries is very good and includes the last three winners of the race.</p>

      <p>Tobefair ran up to his best at Cheltenham on Saturday, but the relatively slow pace of the race counted against him, and he was outpaced approaching the penultimate flight before running on to finish third, beaten only four lengths. He will now have to leave handicaps behind and mix it in conditions races.</p>
      <p>Tim Vaughan’s horses are still running well. Timely Gift at Plumpton and Barntown at Lingfield gave him and Alan Johns two more winners earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Barntown might have won over course and distance a week earlier, but for coming down at the last. His cause was aided by the fact that he was receiving 12-24 pounds from his rivals on heavy going, but he could do no more than win and he looks like he’s on the upgrade.</p>
      <p>Vaughan may have been unlucky not to have another winner when Champagne Chaser clouted the final flight in a race at Chepstow on Wednesday, giving his rider no chance of staying on board. He was doggedly repelling the challenge of the favourite, and with a good jump could well have hung on.</p>

      <p>The feature of that Chepstow meeting was a treble for Colin Tizzard and Robbie Power – all favourites, and all promising much for the future. Most impressive was a 17-hands four-year-old called The Big Breakaway in a maiden hurdle over two-and-a-half miles.</p>
      <p>He was bought for 360,000 euros after winning an Irish point-to-point in the spring. The Big Breakaway cruised alongside a Paul Nicholls runner between the last two flights before Power allowed him to go ahead and trot up by eight lengths, with the rest of the field well behind.</p>
      <p>Ron Harris has had a good year and is one away from posting his best score on the flat since 2013. His latest success was with the maiden Moneta at Southwell on Monday. The three-year-old filly was attempting five furlongs for the first time, and she could try it again at Wolverhampton next Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Bernard Llewellyn’s team have been in good nick lately and their fourth winner in three weeks came with the 11-year-old Flanagans Field in a Plumpton seller on Monday.</p>

      <p>Ffos Las has a six-race card today beginning at 1.10. Numerous Welsh-trained entries mean there ought to be one or two winners among them.</p>
      <p>Robert Stephens’ Beltor will do well to be placed in today’s 3.45 at Ascot, the first part of a two-day fixture where all the races look very competitive.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Evan Williams has a choice of entries in the mares handicap hurdle at 1.30 and his novice chaser The Last Day could build on his recent Aintree success in the 3.15.</p>

      <p>Williams was delighted that King’s Odyssey won a veterans’ race for the yard at Warwick on Wednesday. It’s been almost four years since he last won, but by running consistently well in defeat he has received little mercy from the handicapper.</p>
      <p>He and Vaughan could have some runners at Haydock on Saturday, where Rebecca Curtis’ good, staying novice Lisnagar Oscar faces handicap company for the first time in the 2.25.</p>
