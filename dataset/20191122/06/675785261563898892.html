      <h2>Legendary footballer Maradona hailed Federer as 'the greatest' - and told 38-year-old to call him if he has any trouble in Argentina</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:32:13+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:32</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Legendary footballer Diego Maradona caused Roger Federer to break down in tears with a heartwarming message calling him 'the greatest'.</p>
      <p>Federer leads the all-time list of the most Grand Slam wins with 20 - but his record is under threat with Rafa Nadal just behind, while Novak Djokovic is fast catching his rivals up on 16.</p>
      <p>Swiss star Federer is currently touring South America playing a series of exhibition matches with Alexander Zverev.</p>
      <p>Federer had invited Maradona to his match in the 1986 World Cup winner's native Argentina, but the 59-year-old was unable to attend.</p>
      <p>However, Maradona instead sent a message by video, which was relayed on a big screen after Federer's match against his German opponent.</p>

      <p>Maradona has long been considered to be one of the greatest footballers of all-time, although many would argue that his compatriot Lionel Messi has surpassed him.</p>
      <p>And Federer appeared to be overwhelmed with emotion when Maradona referred to the tennis star as "the greatest" in his video.</p>
      <p>In the clip, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/diego-maradona/">Maradona</a> said: “Hello master, machine, like I call you.</p>
      <p>"You were, you are, and will always be the greatest. There is no other like you.</p>

      <p>"I want you to know that if you have any kind of trouble in my country, you can call me and tell me what you need.”</p>
      <p>Maradona this week <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/diego-maradona-quits-gimnasia-manager-20916700">quit as boss of Argentine top-flight club Gimnasia after two months in the job</a> .</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Federer, still playing at 38, insisted he had no plans to retire.</p>
      <p>"My retirement is going to depend on my health. At this moment I see no reason to stop," he said in quotes reported by the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/tennis/10391026/roger-federer-maradona/">Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>"I think in 2009 I questioned it for the first time. [It's been] ten years and here I am. I'm exactly where I wanted to be at this age.</p>
      <p>"It is a lot of work. I expected to play until 35-36 and here I am, in a new dimension."</p>
