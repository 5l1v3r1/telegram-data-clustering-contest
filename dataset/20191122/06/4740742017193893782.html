      <h1>'We need the M1 to re-route’: Passengers are fed up of ‘unreliable’ 92 bus service</h1>
      <h2>The 92 bus is the only option for many residents</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ella Buxton</a></address>
      <p>South Bristol residents have branded a First bus service as ‘horrendous’ following complaints the service is ‘unreliable’.</p>
      <p>The 92 service travels from <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/hengrove">Hengrove</a> Depot to Broadmead, The Horsefair and it is a half-hourly service Monday to Saturday and every hour on Sundays.</p>
      <p>But passengers who catch the service from <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/whitchurch">Whitchurch</a> have reported long delays with one bus taking an hour to arrive, a resident said.</p>
      <p>Problems with this bus can be traced back to 2016, when <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/firstgroup">First Bus</a> announced they were pulling out of running the service which was formally the 51.</p>
      <p>Back then, local councillors in South Bristol - with a fanfare of public support - managed to save the bus service by persuading Wessex Bus to take it on following a 4,000-signature petition.</p>
      <p>But, despite taking over the service in 2017, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/wessex-bus-close-services-42-1806005">Wessex Bus decided to withdraw their involvement at the end of August 2018.</a></p>

      <p>A year ago, it was reported that <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/wessex-bus-pulls-51-bus-1375890">Wessex Bus had called all their buses off the route for several evenings because of vandal attacks,</a> which saw groups of youths smashing bus windows from the side of the road.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/first-bus-launches-new-service-1816114">First Bus adopted a new service, 2A,</a> in September 2018 but it was not as frequent as the 51 - operating every 30 minutes and only on weekdays.</p>
      <p>By January 2019, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/i-wonder-who-consulted-with-2390078">First Bus made sweeping adjustments to multiple services due to the new M1 metrobus.</a></p>
      <p>The 92 was introduced which operates along the route of the previous service 2A but also stops between Wharnecliffe Gardens and Belland Drive.</p>
      <p>But passengers are unhappy with the service, reporting hour long delays and single decker buses.</p>
      <p>Martin Skidmore from Whitchurch said the service is “totally inadequate” and should run every 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>He said: “The alternative is the M1 bus, which for me is a 15 minute walk away, no good if it’s raining.”</p>

      <p>The 92 is the only bus resident Lucy Pavel is able to catch as the “M1 is way too far away and doesn’t go to Temple Meads,” but she says the service on many occasions has not shown up and she has been forced to wait an hour.</p>
      <p>Louise Bailey said that the bus service is inconsistent and her nan is unable to rely on it.</p>
      <p>She said: “My nan lives on Allerton road and has to get me to drive her to the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/metrobus">metro bus</a> stop by the sports centre as one does not go anywhere near her house and she can’t manage that much of a walk.”</p>
      <p>Passenger Lorna Derrick says the M1 is worth the walk to the bus stop as it is reliable in comparison with the 92.</p>
      <p>She said: “Another issue I have with the 92 route is that it doesn’t go the centre and if I do catch it, I have a 20 minute walk from Temple Meads to get to work.”</p>
      <p>Emma Harkess raised the issue of single decker buses during the rush hour commute claiming she has “had to stand up on the bus home from town on several occasions.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t feel say when the bus is packed and those who need too, can’t sit down,” she said.</p>

      <p>Suggestions such as re-routing the M1 bus around Whitchurch have been made by passengers.</p>
      <p>Local councillor for Whitchurch and Hengrove Park Tim Kent says the poor service of the 92 undermines any attempt to get people to switch to bus transport.</p>
