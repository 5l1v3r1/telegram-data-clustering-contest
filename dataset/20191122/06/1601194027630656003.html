      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/floyd-mayweather">Floyd 'Money' Mayweather</a> took to social media to make a sensational announcement. The hall of famer said that he is coming out of retirement in 2020 and by the look of it, he is collaborating with none other than <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/ufc">UFC</a> President Dana White.</p>
      <p>Mayweather put up a post on Instagram saying -</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Coming out of retirement in 2020”</i>

      <p>Soon after Mayweather's post, White re-posted the same on his own <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5J2QmBFBF-">Instagram</a> profile which gave rise to speculation that the pair may have struck a deal for Mayweather's next fight.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Mayweather shared a picture of himself and White watching the L.A. Clippers vs. Boston Celtics game in Los Angeles. He confirmed that he is working with White to organize a spectacular event in 2020.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"@danawhite and I working together again to bring the world another spectacular event in 2020. #boxing #UFC #mma #mayweatherpromotions”</i>

      <h3>Is Mayweather really collaborating with the UFC for his comeback?</h3>
      <p>It is no secret that Zuffa Boxing is set to kick start soon as White has frequently reminded us about the same and the first event could feature Mayweather taking on UFC lightweight champion <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/khabib-nurmagomedov">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> in the main event; it could also be a rematch of the 2017 blockbuster match-up between Mayweather and Conor McGregor.</p>
      <p>It is difficult to say what it's going to be at the moment but if Mayweather indeed returns to boxing to fight against a top brass UFC fighter, it will generate massive interest for sure.</p>
