      <p>Australia all-rounder<a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/sophie-molineux"> Sophie Molineux</a> has become the fourth Aussie cricketer to take a break from cricket citing mental health reasons. In the past one month, Australian cricket has seen three players step away from the game because of mental health challenges and Molineux’s decision will be a big cause of worry not only for Cricket Australia but also for the ICC.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/glenn-maxwell">Glenn Maxwell</a>, Nic Maddinson and Will Pucovski recently stepped away from the game due to mental health issues. Sophie, who plays for Melbourne Renegades in the<a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/womens-big-bash-league"> WBBL</a>, received immediate support from her teammates and coach Tim Coyle. Speaking to the reporters, Coyle said</p>
      <blockquote>"Sophie knows her teammates and the Renegades coaches and support staff are always there for her… We'll give Sophie the time, space and any support she needs."</blockquote>

      <p>Speaking on the matter, Australia Women's Team Doctor Pip Inge stated her concern on the growing issue of mental health and said that the wellbeing of cricketers was always the priority for the Board and the players were brave enough to make their issues public. She said:</p>
      <blockquote>"Sophie has made the decision to take a break from cricket and we are providing her with the support she needs... The welfare of our players is a priority and we are proud of the brave decision by Sophie to step away from the game."</blockquote>
      <p>Last summer, Perth Scorchers women’s batter Nicole Bolton had also taken a break from cricket post her revelation that she was suffering from mental health problems.</p>
      <p>Melbourne Renegades have replaced Sophie Molineux with Makinley Blows in their squad for their next game against Melbourne Stars on Saturday.</p>
