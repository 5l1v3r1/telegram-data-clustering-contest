      <p>The Vivo S5 announced around a week back is the first ever device to sport both an AMOLED display and a punch-hole design ever produced by a Chinese phone maker. The only other smartphones with this combo currently on the market are indeed from the Korean tech giant – Samsung – and include the Galaxy S10 series and Note 10 series.</p>

      <p>Going back to the Vivo S5, the device is now out on the shelves, which means its possible to check it out hands-on. And well, Chinese media did so and confirmed the S5 has one of the best punch-hole designs ever. The camera hole does indeed have a diameter of just 2.98mm; that’s the smallest punch-hole ever on a phone.</p>
      <p>That’s definitely an interesting “record” to hold as the punch-hole screen design will probably be trending throughout 2020; according to <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/?s=hole">various reports.</a></p>

      <p>The smaller hole is then placed in one of the brightest displays. The Vivo S5 does indeed support a brightness of 800 nits, with a maximum peak brightness of 1200 nits. So the display will be visible outside even on a sunny day. Meanwhile in dark conditions we have a global eye protection mode to reduce blue light by 61%.</p>
      <p>Other specs on the Vivo S5 include a 6.44-inch display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 712 CPU coupled with up to 8GB of memory and 256GB of internal storage. While in the photography department we find an iconic diamond-shaped four camera setup. This includes a 48MP primary, 8MP ultra wide angle, 5MP depth sensor and 2MP macro lens. On the front there’s the single 32MP snapper with lots of beautify features.</p>

      <p>Finally, Vivo’s S5 is fueled by a 4100mAh capacity and supports 22.5W fast charging. The smartphone is now on sale in China for 2698 Yuan, around $380.</p>
