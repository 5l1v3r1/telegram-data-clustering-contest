      <p>UltraSoC will contribute its experience and IP in system-level debug and processor trace.</p>
      <p>The OpenHW Group has announced a range of cores, dubbed CORE-V, based on the RISC-V open ISA.</p>
      <p>Both UltraSoC and the OpenHW Group are active members of the <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/TY_MCD1Mqc5859Dc21bTw?domain=ultrasoc.cmail20.com">RISC-V Foundation</a>, and development in this area will be a key part of UltraSoC’s initial contribution to the group.</p>
      <p>The Open</p>
      <p>HWGroup, launched in June, is comprised of 25 member and partner organisations and operates as a non-profit, driven by its members and individual contributors, where hardware and software designers collaborate in the development of open-source cores, related IP, tools and software.</p>
      <p>“The OpenHW Group is just what the industry needs to make it easier to develop real systems using open-source hardware – these developments are increasingly presenting an equal or better option to proprietary CPU-based alternatives,” says UltraSoC CEO Rupert Baines (pictured).</p>
