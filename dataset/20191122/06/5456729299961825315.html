      <p><b>The Herbert Macaulay Affair</b> is a story that follows Young Herbert who returns from England and begins the opposition to the colonial government In 1898, Herbert is done with his scholarship training and becomes the first Engineer and Surveyor in the colony.

      <p><b>Farming</b> — Based on his own life story, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje’s <b>FARMING</b> charts the extraordinary journey of a young fostered Nigerian boy who, struggling to find an identity, falls in with a skinhead gang in 1980’s England.</p>
      <p>At six weeks old, Enitan (Zephan Amissah) is left in the care of a white working-class family in the dock-town of Tilbury, in Essex. His new surrogate mother, Ingrid (Kate Beckinsale), makes for a complex, but dubious foster parent. Unsure of his place in the world, and lacking a mother’s love, desperate to belong the teenage Enitan (Damson Idris) spirals into self-destruction, falling in with a local skinhead gang led by Levi (John Dagleish).</p>
      <p>When all seems lost, a sympathetic teacher, Miss Dapo (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), offers him one last shot at redemption.</p>
      <p>Told with brutal honesty, <b>FARMING</b> is an unflinching autobiographical portrait of a young man who must battle the odds and realise that, in a world of hate, his toughest battle will be learning to love himself. The film is one hour, 47 minutes long.</p>
