      <h1>Destiny 2 - All Classes, subclasses, and perk trees</h1>
      <h2>A breakdown of all the subclasses and perk tress for each of Destiny 2's classes, the Hunter, Titan, and Warlock.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:45:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:45</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Chandler</a></address>
      <p>There are three main classes in Destiny 2 – Hunter, Titan, and Warlock – and each of these offer three subclasses, with their own perk trees. With the release of Destiny 2: Forsaken, these skill trees were expanded with an additional cluster of perks, which altered each Super for each class. Below you will find a breakdown of every single class in Destiny 2, along with their subclasses and perks.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>All Classes, Subclasses, and Perk Trees</h3>
      <p>There are currently three Classes in Destiny 2: Hunter, Titan, and Warlock. While none is more powerful than another, they each have their own strengths and weaknesses. The most important difference between them all are the abilities found within the subclasses and the perk trees.</p>
      <p>Each Class has three subclasses: Arc, Solar, and Void. Within these subclasses are three perk trees. Depending on what perk tree you choose to use, your Class’s Super may be altered slightly or completely changed.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Hunter</h3>
      <p>The Hunter is the marksman of the Classes and more of a lone wolf. Its abilities focus on trapping enemies, killing enemies from a distance, and using acrobatics to disorient opponents. The Hunter’s Class Ability and Movement Modes are the same across all subclasses.</p>
      <p>Class Ability</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Marksman’s Dodge: Dodge to perform an evasive maneuver with a steady hand. Dodging automatically reloads your weapon.</li>
        <li>Gambler’s Dodge: Dodge to perform a deft tumble, avoiding enemy attacks. Dodging near enemies fully recharges your Melee ability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Movement Mode</p>
      <ul>
        <li>High Jump: While airborne, Jump a second time to reach greater heights.</li>
        <li>Strafe Jump: While airborne, Jump a second time with strong directional control.</li>
        <li>Triple Jump: While airborne, sustain your air control with a second or third Jump.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Below you will find the three Hunter subclasses: Gunslinger, Arcstrider, and Nightstalker.</p>
