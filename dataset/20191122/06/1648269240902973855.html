      <h1>Alfa Romeo 4C Tuned To 350 HP Costs $55,000 Without The Donor Car</h1>
      <h2>It's expensive, but the amount of work that goes into modifying the car is impressive.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:24:18+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/adrian-padeanu/" target="_blank">Adrian Padeanu</a></address>
      <p>We’re inviting you to take a break from all the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/383777/tesla-pickup-truck-cybertruck-debut/">Tesla Cybertruck</a> madness to have a look at a car that couldn’t be any more different. It’s the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/alfa-romeo/4c-coupe/">Alfa Romeo 4C</a>, which although may be living on borrowed time, it still sparks the interest of tuners willing to spruce up the little Italian performance coupe. Pogea Racing is among those aftermarket specialists and has been known to modify the mid-engined two-seater. Now, it has a new car to reveal.</p>

      <p>Part of the “Zeus” project limited to just 10 cars, this tricked-out <a href="https://www.motor1.com/body-styles/coupe/">coupe</a> sits on custom 18-inch front and 19-inch wheels and has been bathed in carbon fiber hiding underneath what Pogea Racing calls the Petrol Volturi Pearl paint. There are some areas where the carbon fiber has been left exposed to create a greater visual impact. Thanks to the diet, the already lightweight car has shaved off a whopping 80 kilograms (176 pounds) and it now weighs as little 899 kg (1,982 lbs) with a full tank of gas.</p>
      <p>The neon blue theme continues on the inside where the striking color is noticeable on the honeycomb pattern applied onto the seats and door cards. The stitching all over the cabin has a similar color, as do the bottom of the steering wheel and the dashboard on the passenger side.</p>

      <p>The real magic takes place in the engine bay where the turbocharged four-cylinder engine with a 1.75-liter displacement has been upgraded to produce 350 horsepower (261 kilowatts) and 465 Newton-meters (343 pound-feet) of torque. The power bump represents a healthy increase of 113 hp (152 kW) and 115 Nm (85 lb-ft) over the standard model. It allows the modified 4C Coupe to hit 62 mph (100 km/h) from a standstill in only 3.4 seconds, do 62-124 mph (100-200 km/h) in 8.1 seconds and max out at an impressive 189 mph (304 km/h).</p>
      <p>There’s just one issue – price. Pogea Racing wants €50,100, which works out to about $55,000 at current exchange rates. Bear in mind that’s just for the modifications as the price does not include the donor car. As expensive as it is, the tuner says it has already built and sold four of them, each featuring a personalized plate and individual serial number to denote the car’s exclusivity.</p>

          <b>A new look for the POGEA RACING 4C ZEUS.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Pogea Racing presents the latest design variant of its Alfa Romeo 4C complete conversion.</b>
        </p>
        <p>Providing automotive highlights again and again is deeply rooted in the POGEA philosophy. With the POGEA RACING 4C ZEUS, based on the Alfa Romeo 4C, the tuning specialist from Friedrichshafen has once again managed to stage such a highlight. The new design concept, designed by Managing Director Eva Pogea, skilfully combines colours and shapes with a multitude of technical modifications. Targeted optimisation of the body, wheels, chassis and engine transform the neat series Alfa into an optical and dynamic muscle package.</p>
        <p>This is already ensured by the extensive bodywork, which subjects the two-seater to an athletic transformation from the front apron to the rear wing. Carbon is also used in abundance: regardless of whether it is hidden under the PETROL VOLTURI PEARL paint coats developed with GLASURIT or if it is visible with the typical fabric structure. POGEA manufactures all its aerodynamic components from the ultra-light and high strength carbon fibre material.</p>
        <p>But this sophisticated manufacturer is not just about looks and aerodynamics. The performance potential of the Alfa unit is also significantly increased by the experienced engine developers by means of the targeted use of high-performance components. Instead of 240 hp (177 kW) the four-cylinder turbo engine now proudly produces 355 hp (261 kW), while the maximum torque increases to 465 Newton metres. Thus fired, the ZEUS accelerates in 3.4 seconds to a hundred km/h and stops only at 304 km/h max. speed.</p>
        <p>In order to transform the tremendous power into forward motion a special combination of wheels and tyres is necessary. POGEA recommends the Pilot Sport 4S high performance tyres from the cooperation partner Michelin in the sizes 225/40 ZR18 for the front axle and 265/35 ZR19 for the rear axle and combines them with POGEA forged monobloc alloy wheels from their own production. The forged wheels manufactured in 8.5x18" for the front axle and 9.5x19" for the rear are an example of another core competence of the South German company: the production of tailor-made forged wheels individually adapted to varying brakes, chassis and body widths. Six patented designs - four of which are bidirectional with a high possible concavity, two are symmetrical - are milled from scratch specifically to customer requirements using the required bolt hole circle and the TÜV-compliant insert depth. T6061 aluminium forged wheels are available in 17"-26" and 14" wide sizes and can be personalised with the buyer’s name on the ring.</p>
        <p>And the interior is also presented in an individual look. Eva Pogea stylishly combines the finest leather from the US premium supplier Moore and Giles with Alcantara, carbon fibre and decorative stitching and creates a magnificent control centre that perfectly combines functionality and comfort.</p>
        <p>Anyone interested in owning a ZEUS will have to hurry. Four of the ten limited exclusive conversions have been sold already. The Pogea Racing ZEUS starts from € 50,100 ex-works in Friedrichshafen including assembly and paint finish. This does not include VAT or the Alfa Romeo 4C basic vehicle.</p>
