      <h1>Global Unichip, Alchip see clear order visibility through 1Q20</h1>

      <p>Buoyed by strong demand for NRE and ASIC design services, Global Unichip and Alchip have seen clear order visibility through the first half of 2020 and are expected to smoothly fulfill orders with strong capacity support from TSMC, according to industry sources.</p>
      <p>The sources said the lingering US-China trade war has inspired first-tier brand vendors worldwide to develop chip solutions in house and prompted China's semiconductor industry to more aggressively boost self-sufficiency. This has allowed Global Unichip and Alchip to enjoy rapid influx of orders for NRE (non-recurring engineering) and ASIC design services from clients in China and other countries in the second half of 2019.</p>
      <p>Robust shipments have sent Global Unichip's October revenues hitting the year's high of NT$909 million (US$29.81 million), with the revenues for November and December expected to each soar past the NT$1 billion mark.</p>
      <p>Alichip's revenues shot up 65.53% on year to NT$417 million in October and are expected to challenge a new high in December when its shipments to China's CPU clients peak.</p>
      <p>Both firms are members of the TSMC Grand Alliance, and the foundry house has promised to grant them priority capacity support in the first quarter of 2020 enabling them to better satisfy clients' demand, industry sources said.</p>
      <p>Their profits are also expected to improve significantly in 2020, as the average selling price (ASP) for ASICs built using advanced nodes is almost double that general ASICs, the sources indicated.</p>
