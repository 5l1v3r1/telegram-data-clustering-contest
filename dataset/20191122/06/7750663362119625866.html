      <p>Ferrari's chairman John Elkann has even weighed into the clash in Brazil between <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sebastian-vettel/"><b>Sebastian Vettel</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/charles-leclerc/"><b>Charles Leclerc</b></a>, admitting he is "very angry" about it.</p>
      <p>"It has made clear how important Ferrari is," La Repubblica quotes him as saying.</p>
      <p>"It is not acceptable that - however good they may be - drivers do not remember that they are always Ferrari drivers and this must not happen.</p>
      <p>"The only thing that matters is Ferrari winning and that it is a team game. And this aspect cannot be forgotten. <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mattia-binotto/"><b>Mattia Binotto</b></a> was clear about this," Elkann added.</p>
      <p>Schumacher, whose brother Michael was ultra-successful during his Ferrari career, thinks driver conflict is an extremely important problem for the Italian team.</p>
      <p>"I believe there will be a difficult internal discussion, because Binotto slowly comes under pressure," he told Sky Deutschland.</p>
      <p>"After all, Ferrari has other worries than its teammates constantly arguing. And they both have that responsibility. They are both old enough.</p>
      <p>"I think it is serious enough that if it does not get better, if there are no clear commitments, then Ferrari might think about changing something," Schumacher added.</p>
      <p>And if the situation further deteriorates, Schumacher thinks the main victim will be quadruple world champion Vettel.</p>
      <p>"It will be very difficult for both of them but especially Sebastian," he said.</p>
      <p>"If they cannot find a solution, it is clear that the future is with Charles."</p>
