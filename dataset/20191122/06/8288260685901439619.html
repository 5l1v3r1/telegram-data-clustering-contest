      <p>The international break is over and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/pep-clotet">Pep Clotet </a>met the media ahead of this weekend's trip to Huddersfield Town.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a>'s caretaker head coach talked about his team's improved fitness, the return of Gary Gardner and - of course, Lee Camp's form.</p>
      <p>Here's what was discussed.</p>
      <h3>How is everyone feeling and how has international training been during the break?</h3>
      <p>I think everybody feels very confident. They feel strong in their own football and their own abilities. We all know that we’ve put games to bed. </p>
      <p>But we are confident because we have been creating chances and we have had an average of 18 shots a game for the last six games. We know the right route in football is to create as many chances as possible and naturally the goals will follow.</p>
      <p>The spirit is very good, and we are trying to play the best football we can to our abilities and our possibilities.</p>
      <p>We did a lot of work physically and some tests and we realised that we are much fitter than we thought we were going to be and because we have compared with seasons before we are in good position physically and is a good boost compared to where the team were.</p>

      <h3>Chance to kick-on in an intense period?</h3>
      <p>Yes, there a lot of games now until Christmas. We are starting the second third of the league. From the first third of the league I would say that we should probably have a few more points than we have now, but we know that in the long run this is a marathon and things even out.</p>
      <p>My evaluation of the first third of the league is positive mainly for one reason in that we saw a Birmingham side against Brentford in the first game of the season that had a lot of doubt and a lot of weaknesses and all the players and staff have put a massive effort in to make sure that we can get as good as possible.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article16694925.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS189313634.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>They’re always chasing excellence and always believing that we could play the football we are playing.</p>
      <p>These first games I am happy that we have managed to achieve a good level of football that we want, the second period of games we want to keep building on this football that we have and making sure that we can get more profit from the chances that we create .</p>
      <p>That is something important for us now because that’s a normal next step for us because we are having the kind of games where we are creating chances. We know there have been fine margins where we haven’t lost confidence.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Jake Clarke-Salter. How pleased with him. Not easy for him to break up established partnership?</h3>
      <p>It was not easy because he played against Wigan and then the next game that he plays is against Fulham who probably have the most threat offensively in the division.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>(Image: TIM EASTHOPE/BIRMINGHAM MAIL)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>When I evaluate his performance, I have to take that into consideration. I realise that he did very well according to the circumstances he offers a different kind of game to Harlee and Robbo.</p>
      <p>He offers us a little bit more pace and he offers different things offensively and that’s the moment we are in now. With the suspension we thought he was the one to step in and we’re very confident that he will even improve on Saturday.</p>
      <h3>Jutkiewicz being given the armband. Reason?</h3>
      <p>Because he’s a player that always thinks something is possible and always puts his body on the line for the benefit of everyone else. And that’s how he understands life and that’s how he understands the game. He has very good balance for a captain.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Jeremie Bela and Jefferson Montero and Maghoma what will they bring different on the flanks?</h3>
      <p>Now we have options to build the attacks. We have an identity and everybody knows now what we want to do.</p>
      <p>We want to build with our young players, especially in midfield and now we want to make sure that we can use these next games and always be flexible with our offensive options to make sure that we can use two forwards like we’ve been using for the last few years or we can even see three forwards now.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article17230894.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS198152712.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>We’ve got the personnel to play in different roles and try to find the right balance in the back and the midfield and we need to nail it as well the balance up front to make sure we have a very good yield from the chances we are creating and that’s a work we need to do for the next few games.</p>
      <p>Some games it’s not going to be easy because it’s difficult to create problems and I’m sure the fans and everyone sees Birmingham having a very good progression and the next step for us is to balance the right offense for us and make sure that we can yield before we can think about during the next step .</p>
      <h3>Have the ideas of more attacking football taken hold quicker than you thought?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Everyone here thought our players could play football, but there will be a time to adapt to it.</p>
      <p>The team will face a lot of problems over balance sometimes because if you try to play more you get unbalanced at the back.</p>
      <p>We’ve been fine tuning a lot of things, but it just shows that the players not are they good but they’ve proved everybody wrong because they are even better.</p>
      <p>Everyone put in everything that they had.</p>
      <p>Our line has been very clear from the beginning and we have got to do it and do it to we get as good as possible and eventually we’re going to do it because our players are the ones driving this and they are ones that want to do it first of all.    </p>

      <h3>What will be the result when Birmingham City take on Huddersfield at the John Smith's Stadium?</h3>
      <h4>0+ VOTES SO FAR</h4>
      <p>Huddersfield win Blues win Draw</p>
      <h3>What are you expecting from Huddersfield?</h3>
      <p>I think it’s been a very good appointment for Huddersfield, I have seen a lot of the games since he took over, the situation was not easy.</p>
      <p>But I have seen Huddersfield Town with very good progression, they are strong at home, they haven’t lost in the last four games there.</p>
      <p>They have sorted a little bit the offensive part, they are creating problems because they have good individuals there but as well there is a good team effort.</p>

      <p>The manager did fantastic at Lincoln, I followed that a few years ago, coming from non league, being a teach, not knowing the league, stepping into the league, taking all this into consideration I think he has done a fantastic job and Huddersfield now I think is turning into what everyone was expecting it to be so I think it is going to be a very difficult game - especially away.</p>
      <h3>Injuries  - Gary Gardner</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article17114635.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_JS196349283.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>Gary is already working outside on the pitch with the group. Then in the main part of the session he is working with the medical staff.</p>
      <p>We expect him to be back with us next week for normal training and then it’s about how he feels.</p>
      <p>I do know that he’s been quicker and he feels much better than we expected. I hope we can get him back to fitness as quick as possible and he can be in contention again.</p>
      <h3>No other problems?</h3>
      <p>No</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>How improve finishing?</h3>
      <p>It’s about the technical improvement on the repetitions from positions that are real for them.</p>
      <p>Craig Gardner is helping massively on that.</p>
      <p>That’s on one side, the second side is the chances we are creating improve the quality of those chances - what happens before we create that chance to make it easier for the shot.</p>
      <p>We have been working a lot on this in the last two weeks, improving the chance and the technique.</p>
      <p>Obviously it takes a lot of time, the repetition needs a lot to go from the previous habit.</p>
      <p>We do have a good squad when it comes to understanding that. They all want to do better and all aware we can improve it, they are putting everything in.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article17152595.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS196930162.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Midfielders need to provide more goals?</h3>
      <p>Yes, I think the midfield should provide more goals. They are giving us a lot of football but there should be more goals coming from them.</p>
      <p>I am convinced that they can do it.</p>
      <p>They are young, Dan and Fran the midfielders who are closer to creating chances and attacking, they are still young. That is based on confidence, their own judgement and their own abilities.</p>
      <p>But it will come from them.</p>
      <h3>Tell us more about team being fitter than expected?</h3>
      <p>We always think that the physical work we do at Birmingham is very, very good quality. We have been thinking that for the last three seasons.</p>
      <p>We test them in the beginning then do different tests in the season, Sean Rush is taking care of all of that with his staff.</p>
      <p>What we didn’t know is where we are going to be as soon as we change the style of play. You never know one hundred per cent how we will physically adapt to that.</p>
      <p>We are playing quicker with the ball, so we need sharper movements to make sure we keep pace on that ball. We knew we were going to be good but the tests turned out to be better than expected.</p>
      <p>We have changed a lot, the methodology we used compared to the other systems, it’s more possession which has an impact on the physical side.</p>
      <p>And we had to do a lot of work physically with the players in the gym to rebalance this.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Previous international breaks have been used for team bonding - did you do anything like that?</h3>
      <p>No because this was the test! I thought this test could bond them! It was the maximum test, they had to run on the treadmill, they get more incline and it goes quicker.</p>
      <p>It was probably good bonding for them just to survive as long as possible.</p>
      <p>We had more training in the international break than there was before so the players do their own bonding sessions and they have the Christmas bonding coming soon as well.</p>
      <h3>One of the fittest teams in the league?</h3>
      <p>The football you play and how much you run goes together, if you sit deep and you counter attack then probably you will run less than if you press high like Leeds or us. We play similar in this part of the game, we need a lot of movement, a lot of dynamics in the game - especially with pressing.</p>
      <p>The more we understand how we play the more it looks that we are fitter - sometimes because we know what we are doing and we are quicker-thinking. But our physical moment now is very good.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Josh McEachran (Image: TIM EASTHOPE/BIRMINGHAM MAIL)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Often talked about Josh McEachran’s fitness - is that getting better?</h3>
      <p>He did the test and he did very well. Actually better than expected. I had a good talk with him.</p>
      <p>He’s putting in all the effort that he can to make sure he’s ready, so that’s good. We have a lot of games now from now until Christmas so everyone will make a difference.</p>
      <p>It was a long time since he last played regularly .. I see him very focused on using this opportunity to get back as strong as possible and he’s putting in the right steps in the right direction.</p>
      <h3>Do you anticipate making a change in goal on Saturday?</h3>
      <p>I haven’t decided the team yet, I have a few ideas in my mind, not relating to the goalkeeper, we had a very good training with two teams, ten v ten or 11 v 11 working on game scenarios.</p>
      <p>We are working on game scenarios one team is losing 2-0, the other team is losing 2-0, how does that team do?</p>
      <p>After training I have to think about what I have been watching because I saw some really good things when it comes to partnerships and things.</p>
      <p>I always do that, tonight and tomorrow, we decide the team, I check with the staff and then I take a decision.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article17132393.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Lee-Camp.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Lee Camp (Image: TIM EASTHOPE/BIRMINGHAM MAIL)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>As a ‘keeper I think Lee Camp had a solid start to the season and I obviously understand the fans are worried because if the goalkeeper makes a mistake it normally ends up in a goal.</p>
      <p>If a striker makes a mistake and doesn’t score the goal we don’t blame him for results, probably we should. We would have won that if we had scored.</p>
      <p>What I can say to the fans is everyone here is very focused on correcting mistakes, on improving on helping us to get better and building.</p>
      <p>We are not naive that the only thing is to build, to build, the importance is to finish as well as possible as well as build the club - that’s my motivation. Tomorrow I will decide.</p>
      <h3>Does Lee still have the confidence of the back four?</h3>
      <p>When you lose a game obviously I can imagine every thinks ‘We should have done better here or better there’. I think that we understand enough of the game, when the heat cools down everyone understands we win and lose together.</p>
      <p>If we don’t trust one of our players the only thing we are doing is not trusting ourselves, we need to trust ourselves, we need to trust our players and if in my judgement if I think a player has to play because of A, B or C then I will make that decision and the players  will understand that we win and lose together.</p>
      <h3>Have you spoken to Lee?</h3>
      <p>Not at the minute.</p>
      <h3>Where do you expect Huddersfield’s threats to come from?</h3>
      <p>They press high very well, they win the ball and cause problems. Some of the players like Grant have a very good ratio of coming in and shooting, he can play forward as well.</p>
      <p>The front three I expect them to be dangerous, the midfield try to link well and create problems behind out full backs.</p>
      <p>I expect a little bit similar idea of the game as Fulham has so I am expecting that when we don’t have the ball we make sure we don’t leave gaps and put pressure in the right areas because they are dangerous up front.</p>
