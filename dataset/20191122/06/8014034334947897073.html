      <p>WASHINGTON — In their testimony in the House impeachment inquiry, a number of key witnesses have chosen to highlight a common trait: Their immigrant backgrounds.</p>
      <p>One came from northeast England. Another came from the former Soviet Union. Another was born in Canada to parents who’d fled the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.</p>
      <p>Several chose to share details of their families’ stories as they testified in front of Congress this week.</p>
      <p>Former National Security Council staffer Fiona Hill, for instance, said the U.S. offered opportunities she “never would have had in England” because of her working-class accent.</p>
      <p>And Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman said he felt compelled to enlist to repay the U.S.</p>
      <p>Their stories serve in contrast President Donald Trump, who has often depicted immigrants as a threat to national security.</p>
