      <p>Barnabas Gan, Economist at UOB Group, reviewed the growth outlook for Singapore.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes</h3>
      <p>“Singapore’s third quarter economic growth expanded by a better-than-expected rate of 0.5% y/y (+2.1% q/q saar). With a positive q/q growth rate, Singapore has officially avoided a technical recession”.</p>
      <p>“Growth is underpinned by a sustained expansion in the construction sector, while most services industries (except Wholesale &amp; Retail and Transportation &amp; Storage) grew when compared to the previous year. Manufacturing continued to drag on growth with a 1.7% y/y contraction, but much improved from the preliminary estimate of -3.5%, contributing most to the upward revision”.</p>
      <p>“<b>Our growth outlook is kept at 0.5% and 1.5% in 2019 and 2020</b>, respectively. This is in line with official estimates whereby 2019’s growth rate has been revised higher to 0.5 – 1.0%, while MTI pencils 2020 growth at 0.5 – 2.5%”.</p>
      <p>“<b>We expect the Monetary Authority of Singapore to keep its <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">monetary policy</a> parameters unchanged at the next monetary MPS meeting in April 2020</b>. This means keeping the slope (currently perceived at 0.5%), band width (perceived at 2.0%) and centering unchanged”.</p>
