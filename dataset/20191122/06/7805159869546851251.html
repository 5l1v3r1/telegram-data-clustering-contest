      <h1>Samsung Galaxy S11 leaked renders reveal penta-camera setup, centered hole-punch display and no headphone jack</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:50:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/pranobmehrotra/" target="_blank">Pranob Mehrotra</a></address>
      <p>Over the last couple of days, we’ve seen leaked renders for a couple of upcoming Samsung devices. We initially saw <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-a51-renders-show-48mp-quad-rear-cameras-punch-hole-display/">renders of the Galaxy A51</a>, which were followed by <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-a71-renders-show-punch-hole-display-quad-rear-cameras/">CAD renders of the Galaxy A71</a>. It seems like Samsung is having a tough time keeping the leaksters in check, as we now have our first look at its upcoming flagship — the Galaxy S11.</p>
      <p>The renders in question come from renowned leakster <a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1197833371516329985?s=19"><i>@OnLeaks</i></a> and reveal pretty much everything about the Galaxy S11’s design. For starters, the renders suggest that Samsung’s next-gen flagship will feature a penta-camera setup housed within a rectangular camera module. We’ve previously seen a similar design in the Galaxy A51 and Galaxy A71 leaks. Other than the camera module, the back panel on the device maintains a clean look with just the Samsung logo in the center. The renders also reveal that Samsung has decided to reposition the hole-punch in the display to the center, much like what we saw on the Galaxy Note 10.</p>

      <p>While those are the only noteworthy changes on the back and front of the device, the Galaxy S11 does seem to have some significant changes on the bottom and side edges. The volume rocker and power button can be found on the right edge of the device, with a slight bump in the curved edge to help users easily locate the buttons. The left edge is completely blank, which means that Samsung has finally dropped the Bixby button altogether.</p>

      <p>At the bottom, the device has a USB Type-C port for charging and data syncing, along with a single speaker grille and, sadly, no headphone jack (RIP). Other than the renders, OnLeaks has also revealed that the device will measure in at 161.9 x 73.7 x 7.8mm, with the camera bump increasing its thickness to 8.9mm. We now also know that the device will feature a 6.7-inch curved display, however, the curvature on the sides is noticeable lesser than what we saw on the Galaxy S10.</p>

      <p>While we don’t have any information on the internal specifications of the device yet, a CCC certification listing <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-s11-gets-certified-with-5g-and-25w-charging-support/">recently confirmed</a> that the device will include support for 5G and 25-watt fast charging. Additionally, an APK teardown of the Samsung Camera app <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-camera-app-8k-video-209-aspect-ratio-108mp/">unearthed strings of code</a> that hint at upcoming support for 108MP photos and 8K video capture. This leads us to believe that the Galaxy S11 series might feature Samsung’s 108MP ISOCELL Bright HMX S5KHMX sensor that can be found on the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-mi-note-10-mi-note-10-pro-redmi-note-8t-arrive-europe/">recently released</a> Xiaomi Mi Note 10.</p>
