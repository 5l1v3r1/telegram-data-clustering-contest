      <p>The prospective coalition taking shape includes the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress.</p>
      <p>Sena was originally allied with the BJP; they won last month's state election together but fell out, unable to agree about sharing the chief minister's job using a rotation policy.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra is currently under President's Rule.</p>
      <p>Now, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut says his party wants Uddhav Thackeray in the job.</p>
      <p>At a meeting with Thackeray late on Thursday night, Sharad Pawar is said to have urged him to helm the prospective government.</p>
      <p>All three alliance partners are expected to meet today.</p>
