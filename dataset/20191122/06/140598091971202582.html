      <p>I love going out for a crisp afternoon walk and returning to a home filled with the smell of a simmering stew. As with most of my recipes, there is a lot here that can be made ahead. The lamb will be all the more delicious.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>25 minutes | <b>Cooking time:</b> 2 hours 25 minutes </p>
      <h3>SERVES </h3>
      <p>six </p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1kg lamb neck</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>3 red onions</li>
        <li>3 sticks of celery</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>a knob of butter</li>
        <li>2-3 quinces (around 700g)</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>½ tbsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 heaped tbsp tomato purée</li>
        <li>a pinch of saffron</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>750ml beef stock</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Cut the lamb into 3cm chunks. Drizzle the oil into a large casserole, place it on a medium-high heat and fry the lamb for about 10 minutes, until golden all over. You might need to do this in a couple of batches.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 150C/130C fan/gas mark 2.</li>
        <li>Prepare the veg: peel and slice the onions into eighths, trim and slice the celery into 2cm pieces, and peel and finely chop the garlic. When the lamb is ready, add the chopped vegetables to the pan, along with the butter, and turn the heat down a little. Sauté for 10 minutes, until the vegetables have softened a little.</li>
        <li>Peel the quinces, quarter them and remove the cores. Halve each quarter and add to the pan along with the cinnamon stick, coriander and tomato purée. Place the saffron in a small bowl and pour over a few tablespoons of boiling water. After a few minutes, add the saffron and its soaking water to the pan too, along with the bay leaf, beef stock and a good pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Bring it all to the boil, cover with a lid and transfer to the oven. Cook for two hours, then remove the lid, turn the heat up to 180C/160C fan/gas mark 4, and cook uncovered for a further 15 minutes, until rich and thickened.</li>
        <li>Taste, tweak the seasoning, then serve alongside the gratin dauphinoise or mashed potato, with some seasonal greens.</li>
