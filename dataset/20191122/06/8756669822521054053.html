      <h1>New GWM P Series (aka ‘Cannon’) bakkie: turbodiesel outputs confirmed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:15:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.carmag.co.za/author/ryanbubear/" target="_blank">Ryan Bubear</a></address>
      <p>A fresh report out of Australia has seemingly confirmed the peak outputs of the turbodiesel engine set to be used in the new <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/gwm-promises-new-p-series-pickup-will-reshape-the-bakkie-landscape/">GWM P Series Pickup</a> (which, in some markets, looks likely to wear the “Cannon” badge).</p>
      <p>While Great Wall Motors has already announced a turbocharged <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/new-models/new-gwm-p-series-pickup-double-cab-bakkies-spec-details-revealed/">2,0-litre petrol engine</a> will be offered, delivering 140 kW and 360 N.m via a ZF-sourced eight-speed automatic transmission, the Chinese firm has said very little about diesel power for the bakkie.</p>
      <p>But, according to <a href="https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-news/exclusive-great-wall-cannon-2020-diesel-engine-detailed-what-chinas-toyota-hilux-slayer-is"><i>CarsGuide</i></a>, a 2,0-litre four-cylinder turbodiesel engine is about to hit the market in China, generating <b>120 kW</b> and <b>400 N.m</b> (local specs, of course, could vary). This oil-burner will be offered with either a six-speed manual gearbox or the aforementioned eight-speed self-shifter.</p>
      <p>As the publication points out, these figures compare with 130 kW/450 N.m (or 420 N.m, in the case of the manual) from the Toyota Hilux’s 2,8-litre unit, 157 kW/500 N.m from the Ford Ranger’s twin-turbo 2,0-litre powerplant and 140 kW/450 N.m from the upcoming Isuzu D-Max’s 3,0-litre offering.</p>
      <p>Running on the new P71 platform, GWM says the Chongqing-built bakkie measures 5 410 mm long, 1 934 mm wide and 1 886 mm tall, with a wheelbase of 3 230 mm.</p>
      <p>In China, the <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/new-models/gwm-says-new-bakkie-will-compete-head-on-with-hilux-and-ranger/">double-cab bakkie</a> is equipped with a damped tailgate, a retractable step and a ladder slot, while GWM further says it will offer a canopy as an option. The Chinese-spec P Series Pickup is fitted as standard with daytime running lights, LED headlamps and taillamps, and front and rear fog lights.</p>
      <p>GWM earlier told <i>CARmag.co.za</i> the new bakkie range was scheduled to arrive in South Africa before the end of 2020.</p>
