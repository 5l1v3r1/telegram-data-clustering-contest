      <p>The session started with the felicitation of Madhur Bhandarkar and Taran Adarsh by Satyendra Prakash, DG, Bureau of Outreach Communication.</p>
      <p>Known for films like Chandni Bar, Fashion, Page 3, Corporate, Traffic Signal among others, Madhur Bhandarkar said, “From being a cassette seller at a lab to assisting director Ram Gopal Varma, it has been a great journey. A lot of people advised me to make a potboiler as my debut film and I made Trishakti with Sharad Kapoor, Arshad Warsi and Milind Gunanji but it was unfortunate that when it released in 1999, it didn’t work and that’s how Chandni Bar was born. I had several subjects in my mind before Trishakti but no producer was ready to back them as they felt my ideas were arty. I am thankful to R.Mohan, who trusted my vision for Chandni Bar.”</p>
      <p>“I always thought that we have so many issues in society that a women character can portray well. It is my comfort zone. When I met Priyanka Chopra and told that I wanted to make a film with her on the fashion world, she funnily told me that now I’ll target the fashion world.”</p>
      <p>Known for female-oriented films, Bhandarkar added, “However, I have made Jail and Dil Toh Bachha Hai Ji that are have male protagonists.”</p>
      <p>The highlights of this year’s festival is the tremendous change in the last 50 editions from participation of 23 countries in 1952, to almost 76 countries in 2019.</p>
      <p>The 50th International Film Festival of India, 2019 is screening 26 feature films and 15 non-feature films in Indian panorama section, around 10,000 people and film lovers are expected to attend and participate in the golden jubilee celebrations.</p>
