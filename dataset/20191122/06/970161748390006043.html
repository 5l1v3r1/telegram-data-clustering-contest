      <p>Ben Stokes scored 91 and Sam Curran took two wickets to put England on top in the first Test against New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Resuming on 241-4, Stokes’ innings and a ninth-wicket stand of 52 between Jos Buttler and Jack Leach took England to 353.</p>
      <p>Kane Williamson hit fifty in New Zealand’s reply before becoming the second of Curran’s victims and the home side had reached 144-4 by the close of play on day two.</p>
      <p>England had aspirations of surpassing 400 in their first-innings after Stokes, Joe Denly and Rory Burns all scored fifties on day one of the match in Tauranga.</p>
      <p>World Cup hero Stokes and young batsman Ollie Pope made a bright start this morning, adding 36 runs in the first ten overs before Ross Taylor produced a superb catch to dismiss Stokes nine runs short of his century.</p>
      <p>Stokes’ departure sparked a collapse of 4-18 in 21 balls as Surrey’s Pope fell for 29 while Curran and Jofra Archer contributed just four runs between them.</p>

      <p>Somerset team-mates and close friends Buttler and Leach combined to frustrate New Zealand, however, with their ninth-wicket partnership almost taking the tourists past 350.</p>
      <p>Buttler eventually departed for 43 and Neil Wagner also dismissed Stuart Broad to finish with figures of 3-90, bettered only by Tim Southee (4-88).</p>
      <p>In New Zealand’s reply, Curran – selected ahead of experienced all-rounder Chris Woakes – came on first change and immediately found the breakthrough, trapping Tom Latham LBW.</p>
      <p>Fellow opener Jeet Raval and Kiwi skipper Williamson then added 54 before the former was removed by Leach.</p>
      <p>Stokes continued to impress by dismissing Ross Taylor and Curran claimed the prize wicket of Williamson in the final hour of the day.</p>
      <p>Henry Nicholls and BJ Watling survived a tricky period before the close of play but New Zealand will still resume on day three trailing by 209 runs.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on the day and the state of the match, England bowler Leach said: ‘It was a good day for us.</p>
      <p>‘We would have liked an extra wicket at the end but if we can get a couple early, we’ll be right on top.</p>
      <p>‘The ball from Sam Curran to get Kane Williamson misbehaved and that’s a good sign when you’ve got runs on the board.’</p>
      <p>New Zealand’s Southee, meanwhile, added: ‘We’ve still got a lot of batting to come so we just need some partnerships and eke out some more runs.</p>
      <p>‘We’ll turn up tomorrow, approach the first session and then reassess where we are at lunch and then the same at tea.’</p>
