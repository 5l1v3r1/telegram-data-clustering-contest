      <p>NORMAN — K.J. Kindler remembers walking into the White House two years ago, seeing a portrait of John F. Kennedy and feeling a bit of a chill.</p>
      <p>“That was really just amazing to be in there and to see just all the artwork on the walls and all the history and how many people will never be able to see that,” the Oklahoma women’s gymnastics coach said. “It smells old. It’s like you’re walking through and old, old home.</p>
      <p>“You can’t even begin to imagine the people who have been there before you.”</p>
      <p>Kindler and the Sooners will make their return to the White House on Friday morning. The team flew to Washington, D.C., on Thursday night and will return late Friday after some sightseeing.</p>
      <p>The invitation from the White House came earlier this month. Oklahoma will be honored as part of “NCAA Champions Day.” Several other national championship teams from the most recent season will be honored.</p>
      <p>While some teams in recent years, mainly in professional sports but some college teams as well, have decided not to visit the White House for various political reasons, Kindler said there was never any thought given toward turning down the chance.</p>
      <p>“Not for a second. I would never, No. 1, speak for my athletes and not at least give them the opportunity,” Kindler said. “I think that’s a personal decision and if anyone didn’t want to attend for a political reason we would obviously support that.”</p>
      <p>The entire team, including the four seniors from last year’s team, were expected to make the trip.</p>
      <p>Maggie Nichols was one of the gymnasts who made the trip in 2017.</p>
      <p>“For us, we look at it as an honor to be invited. Winning a national championship is such a huge deal,” Nichols said. “We’re taking it as more of an honor rather than looking at the negatives.”</p>
      <p>Nichols said she was most looking forward to spending time together with her teammates, especially those who have moved on, away from Norman.</p>
      <p>Jordan Draper hasn’t been to D.C. before and said she’s most looking forward to seeing the Oval Office.</p>
      <p>“I know a lot of big decisions were made in that office so that’ll be really cool to see,” Draper said.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma did not receive an invite after winning titles in 2014 or 2016.</p>
