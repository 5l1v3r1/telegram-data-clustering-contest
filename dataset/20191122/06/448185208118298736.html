      <p>STAFF REPORTER</p>
      <p><b>GUWAHATI:</b> The busy street near Guwahati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) is one of the most packed places in the city. Hundreds of people from all over the State are referred to this hospital for medical care and treatment. However, what stands as a surprise is that such an important location is one of the most haphazard and disorganized when it comes to traffic control.</p>
      <p>Right in front of the GMCH main gate, a big ‘No Parking’ sign adorns the street which is conveniently ignored by the e-rickshaws and Tata Magics. The four-way street should provide ample space, making it clear for the rushing ambulances to pass through without hassle, which was the entire purpose for the four-way street in Bhangagarh GMCH road. But what actually happens is that a fleet of e-rickshaws and Tata Magics block the entire road, making it hard for even ambulances to pass through.</p>
      <p>Preventing accidents from happening is not something like walking in the park. This does not mean that ‘accidents will happen’ is taken for granted. There are numerous specified no-parking zones in Guwahati. If such specified zones have anything worthwhile to serve, why are e-rickshaws and Tata Magics allowed parking in no-parking zones, that too, under the very nose of traffic police personnel?</p>
      <p>Traffic police personnel is seen at the traffic point to ensure streamlined traffic flow at the juncture from where a road each leads to Kahilipara, Ganeshguri and GMCH hills. However, under the very nose of the traffic police personnel manning the point, a number of e-rickshaws and Tata Magics are seen parked as often as not under the hoarding of the traffic police. By allowing such a practice, does not the traffic police mock the very traffic rules which it wants to execute so as to make traffic hassle-free?</p>
      <p>A local of the area said, “The traffic police and the drivers of the e-rickshaws and Tata Magics have a secret understanding between them. This is the reason as to why inspite of ambulances honking away to clear the area congesting the gate, the traffic personnel turns a blind eye. This has been going on for years now and there is no change in the situation.”</p>
      <p>When <i>The Sentinel</i> questioned DCP traffic Prasanta Saikia about the grievances, he said, “We always try to keep sensitive areas such as the GMCH road clear of traffic. If such complaints reach us, we will look into the matter and ensure that our priority of patient care is compromised and definitely take conducive steps. We have already contacted DTO enforcement personnel to ensure that all the e-rickshaws and Tata Magics are licensed.”</p>
