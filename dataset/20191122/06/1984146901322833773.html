      <h1>Metro bosses offer crunch talks to avoid train drivers' industrial action over Christmas period</h1>

      <p>Crunch talks could be held next week in a bid to avert industrial action by Metro drivers in the run-up to Christmas.</p>
      <p>Transport bosses hit out at members of the RMT and ASLEF unions last week, after drivers <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/tyne-wear-metro-drivers-reject-17259877">rejected a 15% pay rise that would increase their salaries to an estimated £46,000 by 2022.</a></p>
      <p>The unions are planning to impose a ban on overtime and rest day working on the rail network from December 1 until further notice, which would mean long delays and busier trains for passengers as rush hour services are cancelled.</p>
      <p>RMT union general secretary Mick Cash said last week that drivers’ pay and working conditions “have been allowed to stagnate and slip way behind the industry norm”.</p>
      <p>Metro operator Nexus has confirmed that another round of talks has now been offered to the unions in a bid to avert any disruption for commuters and people taking the Metro to do their Christmas shopping.</p>
      <p>Nexus customer services director Huw Lewis told the North East Joint Transport Committee’s Tyne and Wear sub-committee that a "fair and reasonable" pay offer was made to drivers which was "as much as we can afford".</p>
      <p>He added: "It is a sensitive time for city centre businesses and the people who work for them.</p>
      <p>"We will make sure our passengers and their employers are informed day to day of any impact that this dispute could have on their journeys."</p>

      <p>Committee chair Coun Gladys Hobson said: "It is very unfortunate with Christmas coming up that we perhaps have a strike on our hands. We hope that the talks go well."</p>
      <p>However, an Aslef spokesman said the union was not currently in a position to enter further talks with Nexus - but that the situation could change by next week. The RMT union was also contacted for a comment.</p>
      <p>While a proposed overtime ban would not result in a shutdown of the Metro in the same way as a driver strike, it would likely result in cancellations of rush hour trains when passenger demand is at its highest.</p>
      <p>Metro has become increasingly reliant on drivers working overtime due to a shortage of staff, and has already paid out more than £500,000 in overtime pay this year.</p>
      <p>Aslef said last week that the network was “haemorrhaging” staff to other rail companies that pay higher wages, while Mr Cash said it was “ludicrous” for Nexus to criticise its drivers.</p>
      <p>Drivers have also voted to withdraw from voluntary coaching roles in Metro’s driver training programme from December 1.</p>
