        <i>David Millane spoke to the media outside the high court in Auckland after a New Zealand man was found guilty of murdering his daughter, a student from Britain who was travelling around the world. With his wife Gillian at his side, he said: 'Grace was taken from us in the most brutal fashion. Our lives have been ripped apart. This will be with us for the rest of our lives. Grace was a beautiful, talented, loving daughter. Grace was our sunshine. She did not deserve to be murdered in such a barbaric way.'</i>
