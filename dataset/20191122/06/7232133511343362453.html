      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin price is down 6% and tested $7,400 (discussed in the medium term outlook) against the US Dollar.</li>
        <li>The price is showing no signs of a strong recovery and remains at a risk below $7,800.</li>
        <li>There is a key contracting triangle forming with resistance near $7,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).</li>
        <li>A daily close below $7,400 could open the doors for a push towards $6,500 (as discussed in the recent <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/19/bitcoin-medium-term-outlook-here-is-why-btc-could-test-6-5k/">medium term outlook</a>).</li>

      <h3>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In the recent medium term outlook, I discussed the chances of bitcoin declining further below $8,000 against the US Dollar. The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/21/bitcoin-btc-price-diving-gates-to-7400-now-wide-open/">first major bearish target was $7,400</a> and BTC price did test the same in the recent decline.</p>
      <p>After struggling to recover above the $8,000 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average, there was a sharp decline. The price is down around 6% and it broke many supports near $7,800 and $7,600.</p>
      <p>Finally, the price tested the first major bearish target was $7,400 and a new monthly low was formed near $7,402. The price is currently correcting above the $7,500 level. Moreover, it traded above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $8,107 high to $7,402 low.</p>
      <p>However, the price is struggling to gain strength above $7,640. Additionally, there is a key contracting triangle forming with resistance near $7,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
      <p>If there is an upside break above $7,640 and $7,650, bitcoin price may perhaps test the next resistance near $7,755. It represents the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $8,107 high to $7,402 low.</p>
      <p>The next major resistance is near the $7,825 level and a connecting bearish trend line on the same chart. Therefore, the price must climb above the $7,825 and $8,000 levels to move into a positive zone.</p>
      <p>Conversely, there could be another breakdown below $7,500 and $7,400. Should there be a daily close below $7,400, the price is likely to accelerate further lower. An initial support is near the $7,200 level. Having said that, the price could even aim the $6,500 support area (the next major bearish target).</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XBTUSD/">chart</a>, bitcoin price is trading near a major support at $7,400. Thus, there are chances of a decent recovery above $7,800. On the other hand, the price could aim a larger bearish wave below $7,400.</p>
      <p>Technical indicators:</p>
      <p>Hourly MACD – The MACD is slowly moving in the bullish zone.</p>

      <p>Major Resistance Levels – $7,640, $7,825 and $8,000.</p>
