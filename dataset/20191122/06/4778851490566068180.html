        <b>AM Bid, the business bid ­specialist chaired by Scots rugby legend David Sole, has continued to grow its headcount as it cheers its fifth year of trading with a further hike in turnover.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Revenues for the year to the end of September rose £169,000 to sit at £898,000, an increase of 23 per cent, the firm said today.</p>

      <p>Staff numbers continued to grow with 12 employees now based in Scotland and England. There is also a pool of 25 experienced “bidding associates” located throughout the UK and Ireland who provide increased capacity during busy periods.</p>
      <p>The firm said its progress had been achieved with no external financing while the business remains debt free.</p>
      <p>During the financial year, the firm saw continued governance via the board which is led by Sole in the non-executive chairman’s role. The past year also saw the establishment of a senior management team with the appointment of an additional two senior managers.</p>
      <p>Andrew Morrison, the majority owner and managing director, said: “While there are continuing political and economic uncertainties around Brexit, the make-up of future UK governments which may either increase or decrease the amount of public sector tendering and the possibility of a second Scottish independence referendum, we remain of the view that the future for outsourced bidding services remains strong.</p>
      <p>“As many organisations move away from direct employment of support services, including bidding, we see opportunities to grow our customer base.</p>
      <p>“We are also further developing our services in both funding applications (assisting organisations to obtain external funding) and award submission writing.</p>
      <p>“It is intended that Board level employee directors will be given the opportunity to purchase shares in the company providing the business with both additional capital for investment and greater long-term buy-in from business-critical senior executives."</p>
