      <p>The great Hannah Gadsby with her show Douglas at the Bord Gais Energy Theatre on Sunday night. A patriarchy-skewering joy to behold from start to finish <i>– Mary</i></p>
      <p>Still being in bed on a Monday at 12.48pm after a really busy week of two jobs and college and feeling like a bit of self-care <i>– Karen</i></p>
      <p>Having a reverse osmosis filter in the kitchen during the boil water notice makes me happy. Money well spent <i>– Sarah</i></p>
      <p>I got back to aqua aerobics this morning after 3 weeks off because of a chest infection! So happy <i>– Joan</i></p>
      <p>Last Monday was a gorgeous sunny day. I spent it planting spring bulbs and filling bird feeders <i>– Michele</i></p>
