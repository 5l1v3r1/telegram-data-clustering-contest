      <p>A woman who sent the Prince of Wales a marriage proposal when she was seven finally got a positive answer – to a request for him to visit the university she works at in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Shona Mardle, now an education administrator, wrote to Charles suggesting marriage when she was younger but her dreams of getting hitched were dashed.</p>
      <p>However, her request for Charles to visit Lincoln University in Christchurch had a more positive response as he spoke on environmental issues on Friday.</p>
      <p>“We share the same birthday, but he’s five years older than me,” Mrs Mardle said.</p>
      <p>“When I was seven I thought it would be a very good idea that we should get married because then we would have only one birthday party each year and that would save money.</p>
      <p>“I thought it was really good.</p>
      <p>“Whoever answered the letters sent back a very nice response.”</p>

      <p>Mrs Mardle, who runs the university’s State of the Nation’s Environment programme, added: “One day, it came into my mind that he might come to New Zealand in the next five years and I thought I would see if he would visit.”</p>
      <p>She is currently married with three children and four grandchildren – to a man who does not share her birthday.</p>
