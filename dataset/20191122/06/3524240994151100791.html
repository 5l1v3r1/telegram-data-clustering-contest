      <p>Family and friends of a graduate of the Federal University of Technology, Akure, Olamide Ogundulu, who was arrested by the operatives of the Lagos State Task Force on Environment and Special Offences, have called for his release.</p>
      <p>The family members and friends, who started an online protest on <i>Twitter</i> with the hashtag, <i>#Free Olamide</i>, on Wednesday, alleged that the task force arrested him in a Gestapo style, while he was working on a site.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that Olamide, who until his arrest, was working with a construction firm, the CFL Group, was on November 13 arrested on Plot 1, Block II, Ogudu Phase II Government Residential Scheme in the Kosofe Local Government Area of the state, where he had gone to monitor the progress of work.</p>
      <p><i>PUNCH Metro</i> learnt that Olamide was arrested alongside 18 others, who were found on the construction site, by the task force.</p>
      <p>Olamide’s cousin, Yinka Omole, who spoke with our correspondent, said all efforts to get him released had proved abortive as the task force gave different excuses for the delay.</p>
      <p>A mobile court had earlier remanded him in the Badagry Correctional Centre.</p>
      <p>Omole stated, “Last Wednesday was supposed to be a normal day for one to go to work in the morning and return in the evening. We called Olamide’s number when he did not return home early, but it was not picked.</p>
      <p>“I was scared and I told my uncle to trace the company he worked for so that we would know what happened, because he just resumed in the company about two weeks before. When my uncle went to the company the next day, he was told that while they were working on a site, the task force men came to raid the site and arrested everybody.</p>
      <p>“They said the workers on the site were arrested on the grounds that they were working on a government property and when we got to know what happened, we thought that they would be released that day, only for me to call in the evening and I was told that he was not released and that he was asked to bring two sureties.</p>
      <p>“We provided two sureties, my dad and my uncle’s wife, and the sureties were supposed to have their tax clearance and their LASRA registration, which we provided. My dad was there on Thursday, but the task force officials said the time had gone and that they should come back the next day; but when my dad went there on Friday with the two documents, he was told that the magistrate, who would sign the release papers, was not around; so, he had to return on Monday.</p>
      <p>“When they got there on Monday, it was another ball game entirely. They said they needed to interview the sureties, who must come back the following day, because the time had gone. The next day, which was Tuesday, the sureties came and after the interview, the task force came up with another excuse that their means of identification were supposed to be the national identity card and not the voter card.</p>
      <p>“One of the sureties has a national ID card and the second had to go to the National Identity Management Commission for the national ID card; when we got it done on Wednesday and took the documents to the task force’s office, we were told that the time had gone and that we should come back today (Thursday).”</p>
      <p>Omole said Olamide had yet to be released from the correctional facility despite fulfilling the bail conditions.</p>
      <p>Olamide’s friends have condemned the task force and the firm that employed him for allegedly abandoning its worker.</p>
      <p>A <i>Twitter</i> user, @<i>AdeyemiSeun7</i>, tweeted, <i>“If It were to be your Blood brother or wife who happened to be your employee will u say this? After 9 days before u could say Jack no be only jack na spanner.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Your company has failed.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“The Nigeria Labour Congress, Trade Union Congress should please address this.  #FREEOLAMIDE.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Another user, <i>@Abimbol49577656</i>, tweeted, <i>“OLAMIDE don’t deserve this….he is a responsible man, I know him very well… What is Nigeria turning to? We can’t even contact him to know how he’s doing. So sad… #freeolamide.”</i></p>
      <p>Another <i>Twitter</i> user, <i>@siyanbolaseun</i>, tweeted, <i>“@laieternal Sir, is this the right time to release a press statement? If they were to be your children, is this what you would have done? Your best is not enough… Just brace up cos karma is a bitch. #FREEOLAMIDE.</i>”</p>
      <p>Another user, <i>@Yankeezy, </i>wrote, <i>“#FREEOLAMIDE @Taskforce112, I’m sure you guys have seen this story by now! It is ignorable when it’s not you or members of your family that’s involved in embarrassing cases as this. Please do the needful! #freeolamide. He is not a thug, neither is he an Omo-Onile. Do the needful.”</i></p>
      <p>The CFL Group, in a statement by its General Managing Director, Lai Omotola, said efforts were on to secure Olamide and the others’ release.</p>
      <p>The statement read in part, “Our attention has been drawn to a <i>Twitter</i> hashtag known as <i>#FreeOlamide</i>, and it has become important that we respond to issues raised therein.</p>
      <p>“On November 13, land grabbers came to the site and arrested all the workers on site, including passers-by, in a Nazi Gestapo manner. On this day, Olamide was on site to measure the progress of work when he was arrested and all efforts to secure his release together with the others were to no avail and before we knew it, they were hurriedly arraigned.</p>
      <p>“We visited Olamide in the Badagry Correctional Centre yesterday (Wednesday) and we were able to talk to him. We hereby state that he is in good health at present. As we write, all the bail conditions have been met and we await the magistrate to set them free.”</p>
      <p>The Public Relations Officer of theLagos State Task Force on Environment and Special  Offences, Adebayo Taofiq, said the agency only provided security cover to the committee on land grabbers, adding that Olamide’s problem was with the court and not with the agency.</p>
      <p>He said, “As part of the responsibility of the Lagos State task force, we provided security back up to the Lagos State Committee on Land Grabbers to effect enforcement at the site. On getting to the site, about 19 persons were arrested and on taking them to the task force office and interrogating the suspects, five were released, because they had nothing to do with the said matter.</p>
      <p>“The remaining 14 were charged and they pleaded not guilty and they were given bail conditions. The issue they have now is with the court and not with the task force.”</p>
      <p>However, when our correspondent reached out to the Public Relations Officer of the Committee on Land Grabbers, Bukola Bakare, her number was not reachable.</p>
