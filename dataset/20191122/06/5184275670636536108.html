      <p>Kartik Aaryan, Ananya Panday and Bhumi Pednekar starrer <i>Patni Patni Aur Woh</i> has managed to create a decent buzz around its release. After releasing the recreated version of Dheeme Dheeme as the first song, the makers released the second which is yet another remake of Govinda’s hit number Ankhiyon Se Goli Maare.</p>
      <p>The number again features all three leads and is a peppy one. Flashy clothes, synchronized hook steps and fun lyrics compile for a usual Bollywood number. The recreated number is sung by Mika Singh and Tulsi Kumar. Composed by Tanishk Bagchi and penned by Shabbir Ahmed the song might make it to your playlists.</p>
      <p>The song originally features Govinda and Raveena Tondon and was sung by Sonu Nigam and Jaspinder Narula.</p>

        <h4>Pati Patni Aur Woh Trailer On ‘How’s The Hype?’: BLOCKBUSTER Or Lacklustre? VOTE NOW!</h4>
        <p>Yesterday the makers of Pati Patni Aur Woh released the trailer of the film featuring Kartik Aaryan, Bhumi Pednekar and Ananya Panday. The trailer has garnered more than 12 million views in less than a day. Directed by Mudassar Aziz, the film is an adaption of 1978 B R Chopra’s <i>Pati Patni Aur Woh</i> Starring Sanjeev Kumar, Vidya Sinha and Ranjeeta Kaur.</p>
        <p>The trailer starts with Kartik Aaryan ranting about his life and is in love with his wife as well as a colleague at the same time. The story revolves around Kartik trying to find a balance between the both. Bhumi and Ananya looks so natural in the film that you feel like watching the old one by B R Chopra.</p>

          <h4>Pati Patni Aur Woh Posters On ‘How’s The Hype?’: BLOCKBUSTER Or Lacklustre?</h4>
          <p><i>Pati Patni Aur Woh</i> makers, after much hype, have finally released the posters of Kartik Aaryan, Ananya Panday and Bhumi Pednekar’s character avatars. The movie which is the remake of 1978’s cult classic is now making to Koimoi’s exclusive section <b><a href="https://www.koimoi.com/category/box-office/hows-the-hype/"><i>‘How’s The Hype?</i></a></b>’</p>
          <p>In ‘How’s The Hype?’ section, the netizens rate the buzz for posters, songs, teaser and trailers of the movie, so it will be interesting to look out for <i>Pati Patni Aur Woh’s</i> reception amongst the audience.</p>
          <p>Coming to the newly released posters, it showcases Kartik as Pati, Bhumi as Patni and Ananya as the barrier between the two as Woh. While Kartik on one hand is donning a ‘usual office going man’, Bhumi on the other hand can be seen in a avatar of regular stereotyped wife, probably a teacher as she has the Physics book in her hand. Probably the reason why Pati Kartik is deviated towards the sassy ‘Woh’ played by Ananya.</p>
