        <b><b>TAIPEI: </b>China warned self-ruled Taiwan yesterday that it was courting "disaster", after the running mate of President Tsai Ing-wen in January elections said he was working towards the island's independence.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ms Tsai chose former premier William Lai as her vice-presidential candidate on Sunday, the day China sailed an aircraft carrier group through the sensitive Taiwan Strait, a move Taipei denounced as attempted intimidation.</p>
      <p>The party the two politicians are from - Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) - is in favour of formal independence, a redline for Beijing.</p>
      <p>In April last year, while premier, Mr Lai told Parliament he was a "Taiwan independence worker" and that his position was that Taiwan was a sovereign, independent country.</p>
      <p>China's Global Times tabloid said China should issue an international arrest warrant for him. China considers Taiwan its territory.</p>
      <p>In a Facebook post on Monday, Mr Lai repeated those sentiments.</p>
      <p>China's Taiwan Affairs Office said both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one China and "reunification"cannot be stopped.</p>
      <p>"'Taiwan independence' is a dead end, and it will bring only profound disaster to Taiwan."</p>
      <p>Though the DPP is not technically campaigning on a promise to declare an independent Republic of Taiwan, some of its politicians are more explicit.</p>
      <p>Mr Chen Chih-chung, son of former Taiwan president Chen Shui-bian and a DPP councillor in the city of Kaohsiung, put pictures on his Facebook page of him with a flag that read: "I am Taiwanese. I stand for Taiwan's independence." - REUTERS</p>
