        <b>WORCESTER, MA, Nov 22 – A Kenyan man has been sentenced to a five to seven-year prison term in Massachusetts US for killing a policeman – Thomas Clardy – during a road crash in March 2016.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the BostonHerald.com, David Njuguna, 33, was sentenced after a series of statements from the policeman’s wife, children, sister and mother.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>Njuguna will serve consecutive prison sentences after Judge Janet Kenton-Walker found him guilty on counts of involuntary manslaughter, misdemeanor motor vehicle homicide, operating to endanger and driving an uninsured motor vehicle.</p>
      <p>He was however, given credit for 1,283 days served while awaiting trial.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors had sought 10 to 12 years, citing the “high degree of recklessness” of Njuguna’s actions.</p>
      <p>“It just breaks my heart,” Chelsea Police Chief Brian Kyes, the head of the Massachusetts Major City Chiefs of Police Association, was quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>“When the prosecution was looking for 10 years — which in my opinion was more than reasonable — to cut that sentence in half essentially I think it just doesn’t go far enough.”</p>
      <p>Clardy’s wife, Reisa, described her husband’s death as “truly overwhelming” in a statement ahead of the sentencing.</p>
      <p>“Because of a selfish and senseless act his life was cut short,” Reisa Clardy said in an impact statement, according to BostonHerald.com.</p>
      <p>“Our stability, our normalcy, our peace of mind, our strength is no longer here.”</p>
      <p>Njuguna was said to be a medical marijuana patient, the prosecution saying he was high when the car he was driving slammed into Clardy’s stationary patrol car.</p>
      <p>His lawyers however told the court their client had a seizure which led to the tragic accident that claimed Clardy, 44, a father of seven.</p>
