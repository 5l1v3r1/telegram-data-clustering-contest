      <h1>RBNZ Financial Stability Report: Expect no changes to policy settings – Westpac</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:26:56+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>Michael Gordon, Analyst at Westpac, notes that “the Reserve Bank will be releasing its six-monthly Financial Stability Report (FSR) at 9am next Wednesday. We do not expect it to include any changes to policy settings.”</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>“First, we note that the RBNZ will be announcing its final decisions on bank capital requirements on 5 December. It will probably steer clear of commenting on the outcomes ahead of that announcement.</p>
      <p>Instead, the main point of interest in the FSR will be around any changes to the loan-to-value ratio (LVRs) restrictions on mortgage lending. These have been loosened twice so far, in November 2017 and 2018.</p>
      <p>Market opinion is split as to whether the RBNZ will loosen them further this time. Our view that there will be no change.</p>
      <p>There has been speculation that last week’s on-hold OCR decision signalled an intention to loosen the LVR rules instead. That’s not generally the way it works at the RBNZ – each tool is assessed separately. And in any case, such a combo would shift the mix of credit conditions in the opposite direction to what we think the RBNZ would want.”</p>
