        <b><b>SHANGHAI:</b> China's fast growing US$100 billion (S$136 billion) market for exchange-traded funds is luring plenty of new entrants, intensifying competition in a market some predict will dethrone Japan to become Asia's largest in five years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>TaiKang Asset Management launched its first exchange-traded fund (ETF) this month, just weeks after Tianhong Asset Management, controlled by Jack Ma's Ant Financial Group, entered the ETF space.</p>
      <p>The eye-catching ETF prospects in the world's second-biggest economy have also enticed global ETF giant Vanguard, which formed an investment advisory venture with Ant in June.</p>
      <p>ETFs, which are low-cost investment funds that typically track an index and trade like stocks on exchanges, have caught on in China as stock-picking active fund managers increasingly struggle to beat the benchmark indices. Individuals are also embracing ETFs to diversify risks.</p>
      <p>"Retail investors in China are finding it more and more difficult to make money through trading individual stocks," said Mr Freddie Chen, a managing director at Vanguard.</p>
      <p>"ETFs are also appealing to institutional investors as a handy tool for asset allocation," he added.</p>
      <p>According to fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors, equity ETFs, the predominant form of ETFs in China, have almost doubled in size over the past year to exceed US$70 billion.</p>
      <p>Despite its rapid growth, China's ETF market is still 10 years behind the US and represents a small fraction of the US$5 trillion global ETF assets, said Mr Philippe El-Asmar, head of Asia Beta Strategies at JP Morgan Asset Management. - REUTERS</p>
