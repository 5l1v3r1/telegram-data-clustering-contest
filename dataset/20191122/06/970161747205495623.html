      <p>Scooter Braun has finally spoken out about his feud with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a>, after admitting it was hard not to make a statement for the past six months.</p>
      <p>Taylor slammed Scooter earlier this year after he purchased Big Machine Records, which owned all of her back catalogue of songs.</p>
      <p>She claimed she wasn’t allowed to buy the masters of her work and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/taylor-swift-perform-old-songs-american-music-awards-reaching-deal-scooter-brauns-label-11178243/">was ‘banned’ from performing some of her old songs at the </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/american-music-awards/">American Music Awards</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/taylor-swift-perform-old-songs-american-music-awards-reaching-deal-scooter-brauns-label-11178243/">,</a> which Scooter denied to be true.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/taylor-swift-reignites-scooter-braun-feud-encourages-fans-go-manager-claims-blocked-performing-songs-11148397/">Taylor has publicly attacked him on social media</a>, he remained silent until now, when he revealed: ‘I haven’t talked about this in six months, not once.</p>
      <p>‘I haven’t made a statement about it and that’s hard, because when you have a lot of things being said and a lot of different opinions — yet the principals haven’t had a chance to speak to each other — there’s a lot of confusion.</p>

      <p>‘I think that I’m not gonna go into details here because it’s just not my style,’ he told the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce State of the Entertainment Industry Conference.</p>
      <p>Scooter, 38, added: ‘I just think we live in a time with toxic division and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/happening-taylor-swift-scooter-braun-scott-borchetta-11152004/">people thinking that social media is the appropriate place to air out</a> on each other and not have conversations.</p>

      <p>‘I don’t like politicians doing it, I don’t like anybody doing it, and if that means that I gotta be the bad guy longer, I’ll be the bad guy longer. But I’m not gonna participate.’</p>
      <p>While Scooter didn’t mention Taylor, 29, by name, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/26/scooter-braun-denies-malicious-intent-taylor-swift-drama-truth-always-comes-10811355/">he alluded to the fact he’d rather the pair hashed out their differences behind closed doors</a> than in the public eye.</p>
      <p>He explained: ‘What I’ll say is, people need to communicate and when people are able to communicate I think they work things out.</p>

      <p>‘I think a lot of times things are miscommunicated, but I believe that people are fundamentally good.</p>
      <p>‘I also think there are a lot of real problems in the world, and I think that these problems that are being discussed can be discussed behind closed doors and figured out pretty easily.</p>

      <p>‘It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for six months and it’s hard because I can handle it pretty easily.’</p>
      <p>Over to you, Taylor…</p>
