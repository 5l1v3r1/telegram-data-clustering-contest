      <p>Now Newtown's Black Poplar tree has taken third place in the Woodland Trust Wales Tree of The Year competition.</p>
      <p>The town council put forward the magnificent tree for the competition and its deputy mayor, Councillor Richard Griffiths, picked up the award at an event in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>He said the town council had entered the tree, which is more than 100 years old, into the Postcode Lottery-sponsored competition</p>
      <p>"I was delighted when the tree was placed third out of a short-list of seven," he said. </p>
      <p>"We are all aware of the importance of trees to our very existence and third place means we will receive £500 to help look after it."</p>
      <h3>Thrive</h3>
      <p>Winning the title was a 400-year-old Sweet Chestnut tree in Pontypool.</p>
      <p>In 2017 Newtown’s Brimmon Oak was placed first in the competition and went on to be second in the European tree of the year competition.</p>
      <p>The Black Poplar is one of Britain’s rarest and most endangered native species, fighting fungal disease, leaf rusts and poplar scab.</p>
      <p>In the 1960s the tree stood on the Llanllwchaiarn side of the river. After the great floods of 1960 and 1964 a flood prevention scheme was needed and the river was diverted - the tree suddenly finding itself on the Newtown side. But it survived and continued to thrive.</p>
      <p>It was further threatened in 1990 amid plans to be chopped down to make way for an extension of the car park. Special conditions were put into place to protect it.</p>
