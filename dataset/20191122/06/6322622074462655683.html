      <p>SEREMBAN (Nov 22); The state government has still not made a decision to allow a private company to develop 141 hectares of land in the Malaysia Vision Valley 2.0 (MVV 2.0) into a Chinese cemetery, the State Legislative Assembly sitting was told today.</p>
      <p>Negeri Sembilan Menteri Besar Negeri Sembilan Datuk Seri Aminuddin Harun said the matter was still at the study and discussion stage.</p>
      <p>“We agreed to conduct a study as this is quarry land and nobody wants to build in a hilly area.</p>
      <p>“If there is really no other development, we will look at the real needs of the area. So we will consider the proposal to develop this land as a Chinese cemetery. It is only being considered, no decision has been made,” he said here today.</p>
      <p>Aminuddin who is also Sikamat state assemblyman was replying to a supplementary question from Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan (BN-Rantau) during the oral session of the Third Meeting (Budget) of the Negeri Sembilan State Legislative Assembly session today.</p>
      <p>In his question, Mohamad asked if the government had given a written consent to a company to develop the land into a Chinese cemetery.</p>
