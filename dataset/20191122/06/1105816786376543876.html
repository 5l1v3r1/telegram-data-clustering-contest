      <h1>Brad Pitt and Peter Berg to produce documentary on Chris Cornell</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:28:32+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>There’s a good news for all the Chris Cornell fans around the globe, especially since the vocalists’ death ruled by suicide two years ago. A documentary film centered on the life of Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman is in the works, according to <i>Variety.</i></p>
      <p>The best part however, is the fact that the film will be produced by Cornell’s widow, Vicky, along with his best friend, Brad Pitt and Peter Berg’s Film 45 production company, which focuses on non-scripted entertainment and branded content.</p>
      <p>Since Soundgarden’s  incarnation in 1984, Cornell remained the lead singer until they broke up in 1997. He went on to front Audioslave with members of Rage Against the Machine before Soundgarden reunited in 2011. The band was in the middle of touring when, on May 18, 2017, Cornell died after a show in Detroit.</p>
      <p>In January, Vicky Cornell and a number of the grunge icon’s fellow musicians, including Pearl Jam’s Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament, threw a benefit concert, <i>I Am the Highway: A Tribute to Chris Cornell</i> at the Forum in Los Angeles. Guest performers included Miley Cyrus, Foo Fighters, Metallica, Brandi Carlile and Chris Stapleton. Pitt also made an appearance.</p>
      <p>Cornell received 16 Grammy nominations throughout his career. He won three: best metal performance for <i>Spoonman</i> and best hard rock performance for <i>Black Hole Sun</i>, both with his Soundgarden bandmates, and just last weekend, a posthumous honor for best rock performance, for <i>When Bad Does Good</i>.</p>
      <p>A rep for the Cornell estate confirmed that a documentary is in the works but offered no additional details.</p>
