      <p>One of Brisbane’s busiest motorways is jammed for more than 15km after a trio of traffic incidents this afternoon. Motorists are advised to avoid the area if possible.</p>
      <p>The first incident, a serious crash, occurred about 1.30pm at Bald Hills on the Bruce Hwy near the motorway exit.</p>
      <p>It caused a massive traffic jam that extended more than 15km.</p>
      <p>A mattress caught under a truck and caused it to break down at about 2.30pm, adding to the delays.</p>
      <p>Finally, a breakdown in the centre northbound lane near the Deagon exit has further exacerbated conditions.</p>
      <p>As of 3.50pm traffic was very slow moving from Mango Hill to Banyo.</p>
      <p>Down on the Gold Coast, a multi-vehicle crash involving a bus on the Gold Coast has left more than a dozen people needing the attention of paramedics.</p>
      <p>Emergency services were called to a crash involving a bus and two vehicles on Brisbane Street in Biggera Waters at 3.26pm.</p>
      <p>Paramedics assessed 15 patients, with two women in their 30s, one man in his 30s and an elderly man transported to Gold Coast University Hospital in a stable condition.</p>
      <p>One lane of Brisbane Street is blocked with police directing the flow of traffic.</p>
