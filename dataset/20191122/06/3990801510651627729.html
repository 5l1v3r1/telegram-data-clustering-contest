      <h1>Watch the Tesla Cybertruck’s unbreakable glass, uh, break</h1>
      <h2>Get in my belly, schadenfreude</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:33:52+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:33</time> by <a rel="author">Callum Booth</a></address>
      <p>Earlier, Elon Musk unveiled Tesla‘s long awaited truck. And what’s it called? Yes, the Cybertruck.</p>
      <p>It might sound like a country and western version of <a href="https://www.cyberdog.net/">a London-based rave-ware store</a> (a niche reference I know), but the Cybertruck appears pretty impressive. On paper at least.</p>
      <p>We covered <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2019/11/22/tesla-unveils-the-wildly-futuristic-cybertruck-starting-at-39900/">the full launch here</a>, but as a summary, the Cybertruck’s top configuration can tow over 14,000 pounds (that’s more than 6,350 kilograms in real measurements) and can go from zero to 60mph in 2.9 seconds.</p>
      <p>Oh, and the Cybertruck’s glass is “armored.” But, seemingly not armored enough to withstand being broken live on stage during the unveil.</p>
      <p>Check it out:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>My god, I can’t stop watching.</p>
      <p>What’s even tastier is Musk decided to give it another spin, getting Tesla’s head of design — Franz von Holzhausen — to throw the ball a second time to try and prove his point. The outcome?</p>

        <figcaption>Followed by the immortal refrain, “it didn’t go through.”</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I mean, is it a surprise the glass broke when a steel ball was overarmed into it? No, not really. But is there a huge amount of schadenfreude in watching it happen? You’re damn straight there is.</p>
      <p>To be fair, although Musk seemed surprised, he took it in his stride. Laughing when it happened and saying “[they’ll] fix it in post.”</p>
      <p>Despite this, it was especially delicious to see Elon Musk continue presenting in front of the broken windows.</p>

        <figcaption>Mmm, hang this in the Louvre.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Oh, let’s just watch it one more time.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/masonmaelstrom/status/1197735866514280448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>

      <p>I mean, does the Cybertruck look like a fascist Toblerone? Or a low resolution PS1 vehicle? Or a nautical protractor on wheels? Yes. Yes it does. But that doesn’t mean it can’t be a genuinely good thing.</p>
      <p>Considering that the top three best selling vehicles in the US are pick-up trucks, the introduction of an electric vehicle into this market has the potential to make real change.</p>
      <p>Let’s just hope no one throws steel balls at it when it finally hits the market in 2021.</p>
