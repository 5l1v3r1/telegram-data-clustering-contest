      <p>The chip satisfies the specifications of less than one-millionth of a second time synchronization accuracy between applications, accelerating TSN support for applications such as AC servos, actuators, and vision sensors which demands high-speed responsive control, as well as remote I/O widely used in network communication.</p>
      <p>TSN links interoperation between information technology (IT) networks and operational technology (OT) networks, allowing product models or production volumes to be changed in real time, while also providing support for the manufacture of multiple product types in varying quantities and boosts factory productivity overall.</p>
      <p>In addition to driver software, Renesas will provide the TCP/IP protocol software, CC-Link IE TSN protocol software, and CC-Link IE Field protocol software essential to developers.</p>
      <p>Tessera Technology, Inc., one of Renesas’ partner vendors, will offer an evaluation board, and Renesas will provide a start-up manual, enabling customers to jump-start industrial application development.</p>
