      <h1>Renault Captur now gets over Rs 3 lakh in discounts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rivan RS</a></address>
      <p>Thanks to the discount available on the Renault Captur this month, prices for the midsize SUV now undercut compact SUVs like the Mahindra XUV300 and Ford EcoSport.</p>
      <p>Despite being a tough crossover-styled (and rather attractive) SUV, the Captur has not managed to rack up the numbers Renault India hoped it would. Newer, very competitively priced rivals in the fiercely contested midsize SUV segment have almost ensured that the Renault Captur has not been able to match their sales figures. The Captur’s design is another sore point for some as similarly priced rivals offer exactly what India buyers are looking for in an SUV – a typically muscular design. In a bid to counter its somewhat dismal sales (just 222 units sold in October 2019), Renault is officially offering a whopping Rs 3 lakh cash discount on the SUV, in addition to corporate discounts worth Rs 5,000.</p>
      <p>However, Renault has also added a disclaimer, saying that the benefits on offer may vary across variants and cities, and depends on the availability of stock. Nonetheless, this means that the entry-level Captur petrol, which currently retails at Rs 9.49 lakh, can now be bought at Rs 6.49 lakh. The table below has the details on the maximum discounts available, based on the variants:</p>

      <p>Due to the sizable discount, Captur prices now undercut some compact SUVs such as the Mahindra XUV300 (Rs 8.10-12.14 lakh for the manual variants^) and Ford EcoSport (Rs 7.81-11.35 lakh*), making the Renault excellent value for money.</p>
      <p>As <b><a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/renault-may-axe-diesel-cars-by-april-2020-413168">Renault may axe diesel cars by April 2020</a></b> – an upgrade to the brand’s ubiquitous 1.5-litre K9K diesel engine (which is known for its efficiency and more than adequate performance in the higher 110hp state of tune) to BS6 norms seems unlikely – this may be the last few months where buyers will be able to buy the Captur diesel.</p>
