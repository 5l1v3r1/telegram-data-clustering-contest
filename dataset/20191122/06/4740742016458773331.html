      <h1>UK weather: Britain to be lashed by five days of torrential rain</h1>
      <h2>Rivers could burst in south-west England and Wales</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T06:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, Emma Grimshaw</a></address>
      <p>Britain is set to be lashed by five days of downpours which could cause more flooding.</p>
      <p>There is a chance of rivers bursting in south-west England and south Wales today (Friday).</p>
      <p>Flooding is expected across a wider area over the weekend, according to the Environment Agency.</p>
      <p>The Met Office predicts downpours will grip south-west England and south Wales today, before a deluge hammers nearly all of England and Wales on Saturday, reports <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-weather-forecast-britain-swamped-20926248">the Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>Rain will batter Bristol for most of the day throughout Saturday but things should start to feel warmer as the mercury climbs back up to 8C.</p>
      <p>Sunday is set to be a drier day in our city as temperatures begin to rise into the double figures.</p>

      <p>An Environment Agency spokesman said: "Local surface water and river flooding is also possible in south-west England and the south of Wales... (on) Thursday and Friday and more widely across parts of England and Wales on Saturday and into Sunday.</p>
      <p>"Land, roads and some properties may flood and there may be travel disruption."</p>
      <p>The organisation has issued 14 flood warnings and 50 less serious flood alerts.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for net<a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather.</a>tv said: "Through Thursday there will be more rain for Cornwall and Devon, later Somerset as much of the UK has another quiet, fair day.</p>
      <p>"The winds back more to an easterly and the rain keeps coming for south-west England, spreading towards Cardiff later in the evening.</p>
      <p>"There is still a scattering of flood warnings and alerts over England so any incoming rain will be viewed with concern."</p>
      <h3>Met Office weather forecast</h3>
      <h4>Friday:</h4>
      <p>Many areas staying mostly cloudy, with showery rain, this perhaps turning heavy and persistent in parts of southwest Britain. Northwestern areas likely to be brightest again. Slightly less cold generally.</p>
      <h4>Outlook for Saturday to Monday:</h4>
      <p>Continuing unsettled with showers or longer spells of rain for many places. Milder than of late, especially overnight. Windy at times, especially in the east.</p>
