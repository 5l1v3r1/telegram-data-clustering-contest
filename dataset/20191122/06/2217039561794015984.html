        <b>Clear water is flowing again from the taps on Pulau Tekong.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Soldiers on the island had woken up on Wednesday to find taps on the island spewing discoloured water.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for PUB said it received reports of the incident at about 7.30am on Wednesday, and that the water supply was fully resumed at 9.30pm yesterday.</p>
      <h3>TESTED</h3>
      <p>She added that water samples were tested and found to be safe for drinking.</p>
      <p>"PUB officers carried out overnight operations and have completed the flushing of the water mains serving the internal service pipes for all camps," she said.</p>
      <p>The spokesman said that water wagons were deployed to provide temporary water supply to the affected users.</p>
      <p>Said the spokesman: "PUB worked with Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) to carry out flushing of the camp's service system and the water in the BMTC main pipes is now clear."</p>
      <p>"PUB will continue to monitor the situation closely. Investigations on the incident are still ongoing," she added.</p>
      <p>In a statement yesterday, the Ministry of Defence confirmed that discoloured tap water was reported in certain areas of BMTC on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"The safety and well-being of servicemen are of paramount importance," said its spokesman.</p>
      <p>"Essential water needs for servicemen, including drinking water and food preparation, have been met by alternative sources within BMTC and PUB-deployed water wagons." <b>- DAVID SUN</b></p>
