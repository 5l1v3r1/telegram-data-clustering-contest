        <b>The delay in the announcement of the presidential elections and an uncertain political situation in the country has affected businesses and reduced trade by 50 percent over the past three months, representatives of the private sector said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The presidential elections were held on September 28, but the results have yet to be announced due to logistical issues and allegations of fraud.</p>
      <p>“There are many problems. Businesses are faltering due to a lack of security and the delay in the elections,” said Sakhi Ahmad Paiman, deputy head of the International Chamber of Commerce.</p>
      <p>Some property dealers in Kabul said the real estate business has been reduced significantly over the past six months due to the ongoing political situation in the country.</p>
      <p>“People cannot even pay Afs15,000 for monthly rent for a house. Business is plummeting,” said Shoaib Rezaee, a property dealer in Kabul.</p>
      <p>Moreover, car salesmen in Kabul said their business has been reduced by 65% over the past few months.</p>
      <p>“We sold three cars a week six months ago, but now it is down to one car a month,” said Mehran, a car salesman.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce rejected such claims of reduced trade, and said there have been investments in the country’s business sector this year.</p>
      <p>“The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has made every effort this year to solve these problems, and it has focused primarily on system-building,” said Samir Rasa, a spokesman for the ministry.</p>
