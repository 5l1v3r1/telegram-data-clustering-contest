      </p>
      <p>Jac's behaviour has already caused her old friend <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/drama-tv/holby-city/paul-bradley-and-patricia-potter-to-return-to-holby-city/">Elliot Hope</a> to worry about her as she has struggled to come to terms with the news that her ex-husband Jonny is moving to Edinburgh with his new wife Stacey.</p>
      <p>Of course, this will have complicated repurcussions for Jac's daughter Emma.</p>

      <p>But instead of confiding in Elliot or trusted friend Adrian Fletcher, she struggles in silence.</p>
      <p>And when Elliot's health takes a turn for the worse, Jac is later left with a big decision - and the pressure becomes too much.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/search?medium=tv&amp;channel=&amp;yearweek=201950&amp;day=">Advanced listings</a> have revealed that things will reach a head as Jac ultimately ends up receiving treatment in a psychiatric unit.</p>

      <p>The spoiler says about the episode airing on December 10: "Holed up in a psychiatric unit, Jac finds herself in a state of denial.</p>
      <p>"She hates the fact that she's there but, when she's visited by the three wise men - Fletch, Sacha and Elliot - she realises that for Emma's sake things will have to change."</p>
      <p>Paul Bradley, who plays Elliot, previously spoke about the Christmas special which deals with Jac's storyline.</p>
      <p>He explained that his character, Sacha and Fletch rally around Jac at her time of need...</p>

      <p>He told <a href="https://www.insidesoap.co.uk/">Inside Soap</a>: "Elliot and Jac are both very good at concealing what is upsetting them, so I think they recognise that and try to help each other.</p>
      <p>"There is an episode towards the end of the year that is quite Christmassy called 'Three Wise Men' - referring to Elliot, Sacha and Fletch - the closest people to Jac."</p>
      <p>Series producer Jane Wallbank has also previously teased the story in an interview with <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/holby-city/a29873578/holby-city-spoilers-jac-naylor-fate/">Digital Spy</a>, saying that there will be a "heart-wrenching performance" as the storyline continues.</p>
      <p>She said: "We revisit the issue of mental health for one character in a very big way running to the end of the year, with a heart wrenching performance from the artist.</p>
      <p>"Jac wants to prioritise Emma and find a better life balance, but events basically conspire against this, with explosive results."</p>

      <p>Elsewhere, in the episode, Chloe is shaken to the core by some life-changing news when Phoebe turns up looking for answers as to why her brother Evan died.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/holby-citys-paul-bradley-confirms-special-christmas-episode/">Xav and Cameron battle to save the life of a young stab victim</a>, but they soon discover that the girl isn't as innocent as she seems when her mother turns up.</p>
