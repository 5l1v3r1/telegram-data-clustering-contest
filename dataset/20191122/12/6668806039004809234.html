      <p>Few weeks ago, the much awaited trailer of Pati Patni Aur Woh was released on the internet. While the trailer got several views within a few hours and the netizens seemed to be raving about it, a certain dialogue in the trailer didn’t go well with a section of masses.</p>

      <p>In one dialogue from the film, ‘rape’ in marriage was used lightly and that has irked many on social media. However, the makers of the film realised their mistake and decided to drop the ‘rape’ dialogue from it. Producer Juno Chopra said in an interview to a leading daily, “Both my grandfather (BR Chopra) and my dad (Ravi Chopra) made socially relevant films and while I haven’t made one yet, I believe in doing the right thing. Respecting people’s sentiments, we’ve edited out the lines.” <br/><br/>Pati Patni Aur Woh stars Kartik Aaryan, Bhumi Pednekar and Ananya Panday in the lead roles. The film retells the classic BR Films' tale of infidelity and how the married man is tempted by the 'woh'. While the trailer has got a thumbs-up, the songs from the film – Dheeme Dheeme and Ankhiyon Se Goli Mare proved to be party anthems and chartbusters.</p>
