      <h1>Jurgen Klopp gives Mohamed Salah injury update ahead of Crystal Palace vs Liverpool</h1>
      <h2>Mohamed Salah has had a worrisome ankle injury for a month and a half and is a doubt for Liverpool's Premier League fixture against Crystal Palace on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:04:01+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:04</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp has admitted that he doesn't know whether Mohamed Salah will play in Liverpool's clash against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Egyptian winger Salah has been struggling with an ankle injury since the beginning of October - when he was on the receiving end of a nasty tackle from Leicester's Hamza Choudhury.</p>
      <p>Salah has battled through the pain barrier, with his foot regularly getting drained of fluids - although missed the Reds' draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> in October.</p>
      <p>He didn't play during the international break however he was seen wearing a protective boot in Egypt.</p>

      <p>Salah has trained all week, although his work load has been closely managed, and Klopp insists that he hasn't made a final decision yet on his talisman.</p>
      <p>“Yesterday [Thursday] he trained," Klopp said. "He trained the whole time since he was here, but only the things we wanted him to do.</p>
      <p>“Today is another important session to see how it looks and we can make the decision. It’s not that it got worse but it’s still kind of there, that’s the problem. We have to be sensible with things like this.</p>

      <p>“But I didn’t make the decision. If I would have made a decision, I probably wouldn’t have told you now, but it’s true I have to see the session today.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> have a host of injury worries which German Klopp gave updates on during his press conference.</p>
      <p>Asked for an update on Andy Robertson, Joel Matip and van Dijk, Klopp said: “In the moment, yes, Virgil is 100 per cent available.</p>
      <p>“But it’s the time of the year when players get out of the squad overnight, unfortunately, with some other things – getting sick or ill or whatever.</p>
      <p>“From the others, I cannot say 100 per cent, I don’t know 100 per cent. Today is a very important session to judge that, especially with the players who came back late.</p>
      <p>“Fabinho and Bobby and Ali played on Tuesday, Gini Wijnaldum played on Tuesday, so we have these players where we really need to have a look at how they react and what makes sense for them or not.</p>
      <p>“It’s always how it is with the first game after the international [break], we have to wait until the last second pretty much to make the decision. Nobody came back with a serious injury or something like that but we still have to look how they are.”</p>
