      <h1>Riot breaks out during funeral procession in Bolivia</h1>

      <p>Thousands marched the streets of the Bolivian capital La Paz carrying the coffins of eight people killed in violent clashes with the military and police.</p>
      <p>Security forces responded to the emotional protest by firing tear gas to clear the crowds, as they wept and mourned for the young victims, aged 22 to 37, shot on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Images show children crying at the side of the road, while rescue teams work to help them breathe after being shot at with the gas, while adults cover their mouths with their t-shirts as they defiantly carry the coffins of their loved ones.</p>
      <p>The mass procession, which was held in honour of the victims, soon turned into an anti-government move with civilians loading coffins onto military tanks as troops attempt to wade through the crowds.</p>
      <p>Since former socialist president Evo Morales resigned on November 10, at least 29 people have been killed in protests in the South American country which is grappling with its worst crisis in decades.</p>

      <p>Mr Morales, who was the country’s first indigenous leader and longest-serving president, is currently in exile in Mexico after claiming he was ousted by a racist right-wing coup.</p>

      <p>He resigned following pressure from security forces and civic leaders, after an international audit found serious irregularities in the October 20 elections, which saw him gain an outright victory for a fourth straight term.</p>
      <p>Former opposition senator, Jeanine Áñez, took office as interim president last week and is attempting to move the country past its almost 14-year left-wing rule under the Movement for Socialism (MAS) party.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, supporters of Mr Morales – who was the son of llama herders and was a coca farmer before his premiership – attempted to blockade a fuel storage depot in Senkata.</p>
      <p>But several men and women were killed after a violent confrontation with troops.</p>
      <p>Officials have rejected claims the army was behind the killings, after locals blamed them for the ‘massacre of innocent workers’.</p>

      <p>Aurelio Miranda, 54, told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/bolivia-el-alto-violence-death-protest">The Guardian</a>: ‘The world must know the truth.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘What happened was a massacre… They used weapons like you use in a war. They didn’t think about the consequences. That’s why so many are dead.’</p>
      <p>‘I feel so much pain as a Bolivian, that Bolivians are slaughtering their own brothers’.</p>
      <p>One of Ms Áñez’s ministers previously told local media the interim government was willing to grant the military power to use the level of force they thought appropriate when handling protests.</p>
      <p>Human rights activists have grave concerns over the rise in deaths and have urged the government to change tactics.</p>
      <p>Mr Morales has also described the events in the capital as a ‘massacre’ and told reporters ‘they are killing my brothers and my sisters… this is the kind of thing the old military dictatorships would do.’</p>

      <p>The former president has insisted he will return to his native country and on Thursday he wrote on Twitter that an international ‘truth commission’ would meet to investigate whether electoral fraud played a part in the election outcome.</p>
      <p>However, lawmakers standing with his MAS party have already agreed to work with opposition leaders to pass law to annul the October vote and force through new elections.</p>

      <p>MAS has proposed to hold another vote by the end of January.</p>
