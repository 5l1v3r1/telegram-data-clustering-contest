      <h1>Concerns over new £50m Perth High School</h1>
      <h2>Councillors met to comment on the pre-application report earlier this week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:36:28+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:36</time> by <a rel="author">Kathryn Anderson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/kathryn-anderson/</a></address>
      <p>Concerns about parking, climate change and capacity have been raised in relation to the new £50 million Perth High School.</p>
      <p>Councillors on the planning and development committee met to comment on the pre-application report earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Convener Conservative councillor Roz MCall told the planning and development management committee, as they were given a chance to comment on the report, this was the “most important part” of the planning process to bring forward any issues “right at early doors”.</p>
      <p>A public exhibition was held in Perth High School on October 28 with all local politicians, neighbouring residents, parents/carers of pupils at Perth High School and its feeder primaries, South Perth Community Partnership and clubs and organisations who currently use Perth High School notified.</p>
      <p>Cllr Willie Wilson said his inbox had been “a little busier” since that pre-consultation.</p>
      <p>The Perth South councillor pointed to how the three-storey building is quite near neighbouring residential properties.</p>
      <p>Cllr Wilson raised the matter of parking, firstly with construction traffic. He added: “It will be an issue for staff and for students.”</p>
      <p>He expressed concern about road safety during construction with 1600 pupils at the school, and with the current phased drop-off at the school which will be moved to the opposite end of the school site.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dem councillor said there were “already problems” with drainage and “they will continue to be there”. In addition, he told councillors he felt tree and hedge landscaping is “particularly important” and raised concerns about floodlighting and sports pitches with neighbouring streets likely to be affected.</p>
      <p>SNP councillor Eric Drysdale had questions about when a demolition would be carried out. He said: “With this being a replacement high school, I presume the existing high school will have to be demolished.”</p>
      <p>He said he did not know if this would be carried out before or after the new school’s occupied but asked if it “can be done safely without disrupting the new school and local residents.”</p>
      <p>He also highlighted an issue which he said was not in the council papers, saying: “I do not imagine that PKC is planning to build too many more schools so I think we would want to be comfortable that the school would be able to cope with projected population figures, particularly with regards to Perth West.”</p>
      <p>SNP councillor Richard Watters asked that the planning team consider the climate crisis when making decisions about “materials, heatings and other issues.”</p>
