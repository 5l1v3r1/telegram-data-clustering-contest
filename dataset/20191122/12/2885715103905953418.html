      <p>Rocking a magazine cover or a red carpet event doesn’t come easy. And if you follow celebrities on social media, you would know that a lot of hard work goes behind those stunning pictures. Recently, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/alia-bhatt/">Alia Bhatt</a> posted a video on her YouTube channel where she recorded her complete fitness regime along with her trainer, Sohrab Khushrushahi.</p>
      <p>In the vlog, the <i>Highway</i> actor shares that she does a mixed workout which consists of weight training, Pilates and badminton. However, in the video, Bhatt is having a rigorous leg day along with many other exercises and fitness secrets.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Her complete list of exercises was:</b>
      </p>
      <p>10 weighted back squats<br/>1 minute of row<br/>10 squats, 5 hostage jumps and again 10 squats<br/>45 seconds of skips<br/>45 seconds of mountain climbers<br/>5 Gorilla hops followed by backward bear crawl<br/>One minute plank hold</p>
      <p>Animal walks are quite a trend these days, and they can also be amazing movement drills for strength, conditioning and improving the overall movement coordination, mobility and capacity in the human body. Here are some animal walk-inspired exercise that you can practice.</p>
      <p>*<b> Duck walk</b> – Moving in a squat position where you are trying to stay as low as possible the entire duration of the exercise. The exercise is strenuous and can act as a reasonable strength builder. It is helpful for martial art trainers.</p>
      <p>* <b>Bunny hops</b> – The higher and further you jump, the more plyometric strength the move will require.</p>
      <p>*<b> Crab walks</b> – This is a great beginner exercise to condition your wrists and improve strength in the triceps, hamstring and glutes.</p>
      <p>* <b>Chameleon walks</b> – It helps to build strength and stability in the body better than any other animal walk out there. The one arm-one leg aspect of the chameleon walks will develop the body’s movement coordination and also stabilises it.</p>
      <p>* <b>Gorilla hops</b> – As the name suggests you have to hop like a gorilla. It helps to strengthen your arm muscles and your glutes.</p>
      <p>*<b> Backward bear crawl</b> – It is a cardiovascular and total body exercise that primarily targets the shoulders, but also works the abs, calves, chest, forearms, glutes, groin, hamstrings, hip flexors, lats, middle back, quads and triceps.</p>
