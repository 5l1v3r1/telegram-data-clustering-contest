      <h2>Nemanja Matic has seemingly fallen out of contention at Man Utd under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, while new Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho has worked with the Serbian twice</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:56:55+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:56</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has refused to be offended by Nemanja Matic's interaction with a post joking that he will re-join former boss Jose Mourinho at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> .</p>
      <p>Midfielder Matic responded to a post on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> from the account BenchWarmers which suggested that he would reunite with Mourinho at Spurs, with a pair of clapping and laughing emojis.</p>
      <p>The comment was clearly a joke, and Solskjaer has taken it as such - and laughed it off as Matic simply having a sense of humour.</p>
      <p>"That's not a part of being boring when it's like this," Solskjaer said.</p>
      <p>"You like Jose coming back, it's going be a spectacle and a circus and Nemanja has a sense of humour."</p>

      <p>Serbia international Matic has worked with Mourinho at both <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>Matic, 31, has seemingly fallen out of favour under Solskjaer, making just five appearances this season, while he has also had his playing time limited due to a string of injuries.</p>
      <p>With Mourinho replacing Mauricio Pochettino as Spurs manager this week, many on social media put two and two together to make a joke.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has previously said about Matic: “He represents everything we want in a footballer – loyalty, consistency, ambition, team player.</p>

      <p>“I would like to thank him for his desire to join us because without that, it would be impossible to have him here.”</p>
      <p>And in another interview called him "my guy". The Portuguese said tot he Times in 2017: “[Nemanja] Matic, I cannot say that I had better guys than him in my career.</p>
      <p>“And he has with me something which marks forever, which was a match where he was on the bench, I play him minute 45 and I took him off minute 70, 75. The press wants a story, the press wants blood. My blood, or his blood, or both.</p>
      <p>“He was really sad. I was also sad because it’s not something nice and it’s something that I did only twice in my career. But the next day he comes to me and he says, ‘I’m not happy, but it’s my fault. I’m not happy with what you did to me, but it’s my fault, because the way I was playing I can understand the change. So let’s keep going.’</p>
      <p>“We didn’t keep going for a long time because a few weeks later I was sacked. But again he was one of ‘my guys’, was one of the guys that we kept close during these years even not working together. So I know that the big man is there, even with more maturity.”</p>
