      <h1>Metro ticket app to launch in 2020 - allowing passengers to tap in at stations using their phone</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Holland</a></address>
      <p>A new app allowing Metro passengers to buy and store tickets on their smartphones is now expected to launch next year.</p>
      <p>The long-awaited upgrades will allow customers to tap in and out at Metro station ticket gates using their phone.</p>
      <p>A trial is currently being undertaken with Metro staff using a version of the app, which will be released to the public in 2020.</p>
      <p>It had been <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/metro-passengers-able-store-tickets-15499117">expected that the service would launch this year</a> , helping to reduce queues at stations and reducing the need for paper tickets or plastic smartcards.</p>
      <p>But Nexus customer services director Huw Lewis told councillors on Thursday that the app’s development had been delayed, largely due to legal reasons due to concerns over the handling of passengers’ data.</p>
      <p>He added: “Trials are now taking place with our staff. They are, on a day to day basis, using their phones to touch in and out. That started a few weeks ago. The next stage will be with a limited passenger group.</p>
      <p>“Passengers will have the opportunity to choose to use their mobiles to travel on Metro next year.”</p>
      <p>Nexus managing director Tobyn Hughes is among those taking part in the trial and said that the app makes travelling on the Metro “much easier”.</p>

      <p>He told the North East Joint Transport Committee’s Tyne and Wear sub-committee: “The purpose is to get feedback so that the app can be fine tuned so that it is fit for public use.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully it will be appreciated by passengers when we are able to release it in the new year.”</p>
      <p>It was also confirmed at the meeting that ticket prices on the rail network are going to rise from January.</p>
      <p>The cost of adult single or day tickets will go up by 10p – but only 5p for those using Pop cards.</p>
      <p>Season ticket prices will increase by 3%, but fares for young people aged 18 and under are being frozen at current levels.</p>
