      <h1>Bristol Rovers coach on injuries, Menayese's progress, Shrewsbury Town and Clarke-Harris' boxing sessions</h1>
      <h2>Every word from the Gas assistant manager</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:51:52+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:51</time> by <a rel="author">James Bishop</a></address>
      <h3>Joe, Tuesday night there was issues sometimes with the performance (against Bromley), but it’s progress, it’s a win, get’s you through to the next round and keeps the wagon rolling ...</h3>
      <p>Yeah, I think progression in the competition was key. Ask anyone who plays in this competition in the early rounds, the goal is to get to get to the stages were we can certainly dream and to go through was very important.</p>
      <p>There will be a lot of other clubs in our position that would have <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mini-fist-pump-player-ratings-3555674">liked to have taken that kind of result</a> in the games they’ve played.</p>
      <p>Against a very tough opposition, I thought we were very professional, our work and discipline without the ball was at times fantastic; to shut out a team who score a lot of goals at home and on a difficult surface was great credit to the team.</p>
      <h3>There were a couple of changes, Rollin (Menayese) coming in, he hadn’t had a lot of football, but it was nice for him to get his opportunity and take it?</h3>
      <p>On the coaching staff when we see the ability of players to listen to what information they’ve been given, and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-january-transfer-window-3557778">Rollin is a player who’s been patient</a> and had to wait, he’s done his loan and been in and around the group for a period of time.</p>
      <p>He's been receptive to our coaching and the manager showed great bravery in being able to pick him.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>We’ve said this before, talent is really nothing without opportunity and once again we’ve given a young player an opportunity and on the night I thought he did very well.</p>
      <p>It’s a beginning, it’s a start, it’s time to hopefully start putting in some back-to-back performances in and he can progress.</p>
      <h3>In terms of those that weren’t involved on the night are those that are slowly coming back, are there any more coming into the group this weekend?</h3>
      <p>We’ve got a strong group; I think the sports science and medical department and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-set-alter-preparation-3560069">our preparation for the game</a> on an AstroTurf was spot on.</p>
      <p>We’ve managed to get most people recovered, we have a more lengthy process with the recovery with one or two players, but generally we’re in a healthy position going into this morning’s (Friday's) session.</p>
      <h3>So would you expect to add a player or two to the squad?</h3>
      <p>Yeah we could add possibly one or two. Tareiq (Homes-Dennis) had a game on Tuesday evening and got 60 minutes, and again it’s fantastic for us all that his progression is good.</p>
      <p>We’ve had one or two players playing with knocks and getting through it who have managed to play a lot longer than we expected so again great credit to those players like <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/criticism-tom-nichols-affecting-jonson-3544831">Jonson Clarke-Harris playing a full 90 minutes</a> on that surface was fantastic, we didn’t expect that.</p>
      <p>It just shows you that the group are feeling positive about themselves and there’s some healthy competition.</p>

      <h3>How close do you think he (Clarke-Harris) is to being match fit because the amount of time he’s missed is not that much but enough to not be quite there yet?</h3>
      <p>He can’t quite be there yet, obviously you need a run of games. However, when you watch the game back in certain areas you think ‘wow he’s still going, and he’s made a good run into the box there’.</p>
      <p>So a great credit to him personally and obviously the staff for the work they’re putting in for him. Because what people don’t see is him putting extra hours in the gym and working with physiotherapy and sport science department, and at times working with gaffer with the boxing gloves, obviously not punching each other but the bags and the pads!</p>
      <p>So he puts in the extra hours to get himself fit, but it’s not just him though, the players have shown a real appetite here to improve themselves and fitness-wise as well.</p>
      <h3>We know it’s very much a squad game but him being back and available just gives you a different threat and a different option than you have without him</h3>
      <p>Yeah of course, he’s, from a stature and physical point of view he’s different to our other strikers. He gives us a presence but the main thing is he gives us goals.</p>
      <p>So it’s very important when you have players like that; to work with them and play to their strengths.</p>

      <p>But the guys around him have helped: Tom Nichols, Victor (Adeboyejo) and Tyler (Smith), also young Lucas (Tomlinson) coming through and we’ve Kyle (Bennett) in and around the team that need to push each other, the attacking players and strikers needs to push each other.</p>
      <h3>Shrewsbury this weekend, kind of similar to you in terms of the table, these are the games coming into Christmas that determine where you end up respectively.</h3>
      <p>I’ve never been one to follow that, I think things can happen in the New Year where you can get a run together and so on.</p>
      <p>But you’re right in what you’re saying, I think coming into this period now, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/shrewsbury-town-finding-momentum-demanding-3562997">you feel that December air</a>, you can feel it and you think we’re still in two cup competitions, we’re pushing, we’re looking forward, we’re in a group of teams  at the moment that can progress and bring themselves back into contention.</p>
      <p>So getting into that December period in a competitive position, where we are right now, close to the top bit, along with Shrewsbury and other top teams - they’re big games and it’s great to keep having those big games and knowing that the prize is precious.</p>
      <p>So we’re going to fight and scrap for every point, and we’ll go in there with that commitment we’ve had in all the other games this season.</p>
      <h3>What have you made of them from the work you’ve done in the lead up to this game?</h3>
      <p>I’m not going to tell you everything! We know that they possess dangers of course, the manager has been working with them for a period of time.</p>
      <p>We know that if we’re in any way lacking concentration in certain moments with the way they play, being able to use two or three different styles we need to be ready and with due diligence and we pride ourselves on that.</p>
      <p>We’ll give you the players all we possibly can. Our prep starts pretty much on the bus after Bromley.</p>
      <p>They had a replay the other evening [Shrewsbury beat Bradford 1-0 on Tuesday] and as you’ve said we’re close, the two teams are close, fine margins and it could come down to just a small bit of detail.</p>
      <h3>How’s Tom Davies, is he back in contention?</h3>
      <p>Tom’s working hard, he’s in the rehabilitation phase at the moment. Again though, what I said earlier, he’s putting the hours in, his appetite to get back is immense and strong, and we have him around the group, he’s very important and he has a lot of value to the team and the quicker we get him back the better.</p>
      <h3>I know we touched on Tareiq, but with him coming back to fitness right now, there’s a lot of options down the left, what do you think each one offers to the team: you have Michael Kelly, and Luke Leahy, they’re different types of players but what can they offer?</h3>
      <p>Three different players, but the key there is three different types of characters, they're not all the same.</p>
      <p>So, in the modern game we have fluidity with those players, we can play one up as well as one in, as well as the position they can occupy i.e. wing back or left back.</p>
      <p>So, we can utilise them in different way, although it’s three players for one position we can use them in different ways.</p>

      <h3>How are Ollie (Clarke) and JCH after playing on a plastic pitch in terms of their recovery?</h3>
      <p>In terms of recovery, very good. Like I said, great credit to the staff, the gaffer was spot on with preparation and recovery, meticulous really with sports science and the medical department getting them ready.</p>
      <p>When you win, recovery is a little bit quicker and both of them are fine.</p>
      <h3>In terms of our away form, last season it was very good, but we haven’t quite reached that pinnacle this season, what do you put that down to, our home form is very good, just the away form isn’t quite catching up?</h3>
      <p>Generally football, those kind of things happen, you can go through a season and be good at home, not so good at home, excellent away and not so good away.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article3555791.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JMP_Bromley_v_Bristol_Rovers_RH_051JPG.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>The trick is to balance that out and to be as consistent as you possibly can, and I think generally over the course of the season the teams who are the pinnacle of any league will be as consistent as what they want to be.</p>
      <p>Every season is different and generally it’s hard to create chances away from home, its harder. The hardest thing to do is to keep clean sheets, in any league now, and it’s also getting very difficult to get many chances away from home. </p>
      <p>Atmosphere obviously plays a big part and we’re working very hard to bridge the gap, but generally we’re looking okay.</p>
