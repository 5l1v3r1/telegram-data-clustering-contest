      <h1>CDC claims 47 Americans are dead as a result of vaping</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:54:14+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:54</time> by <a rel="author">Amanda Woods</a></address>
      <p>The number of vaping-related lung injuries in the US <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html">has risen to 2,290 this week</a>, with 47 deaths recorded, federal officials announced.</p>
      <p>That figure, recorded on Wednesday, is up by 118 injuries from last week, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2019/s1114-update-number-vaping.html">when 2,172 cases were reported</a>, according to the CDC.</p>
      <p>Those injuries have been reported in 49 states, the District of Columbia as well as Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Alaska is the only state without any vaping-related injuries, the agency reported.</p>
      <p>Forty-seven deaths have been reported as a result of e-cigarette use in 25 states and DC as of Wednesday, officials said.</p>
      <p>That’s an increase of five from last week, when 42 deaths were confirmed in 24 states.</p>
      <p>Officials this week announced that a second New Yorker has <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/second-new-yorker-dead-from-vaping-related-illness-officials/">died of a vaping-related injury</a>.</p>
      <p>The man — who was in his 30s and had a “history of using e-cigarettes and vape products” — died Nov. 9 at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan, according to sources and Gov. Andrew Cuomo.</p>
      <p>Early on, New York officials were the first to name vitamin E acetate as the compound likely behind the mystery illnesses, saying in early September that the substance was found in “nearly every” marijuana vape product they tested.</p>
      <p>Federal health officials backed that finding this month, labeling the substance a “chemical of concern” after finding it in lung fluid samples from 29 patients diagnosed with EVALI, or e-cigarette or vaping associated lung injury.</p>
      <p>President Trump will hold a meeting Friday to discuss the rise in e-cigarette use among youth and how the products should be regulated, White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/health/vaping-lung-injury-2290-bn/index.html">told CNN in a statement</a>.</p>
      <p>“Participants will include a diverse group of advocacy, industry, non-profits, medical associations, and State officials,” Deere wrote. “As the President has said, there is a serious problem among our youth and their growing addiction to e-cigarettes. The policy making process is not stalled — it continues to move forward. This meeting will allow the President and other Administration officials an opportunity to hear from a large group, representing all sides as we continue to develop responsible guidelines that protect the public health and the American people.”</p>
