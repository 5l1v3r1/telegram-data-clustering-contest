      <h1>Candied citrus peel matchsticks recipe</h1>

      <p>Making your own candied peel is easy and tastes much better than supermarket versions, especially if you use really thick-skinned fruit. It’s also lovely coated in chocolate and eaten with coffee at the end of a meal. Because the flavour reminds me of Matchmakers, I dip one end in chocolate to make a “matchhead” and pack them in a large matchbox lined with greaseproof paper.</p>
      <p>The leftover juice and syrup makes a great Christmas cordial: just mix with still or sparkling water.</p>
      <p>One caveat: the sugar content of this peel is lower than professionally made candied peel, so it won’t last far into the new year. The strips should keep for a week.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time</b>: 25 minutes, plus overnight | <b>Cooking time</b>: 1 hour 25 minutes</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>4 thick-skinned lemons, 3 oranges or 1 large pink grapefruit</li>
        <li>500g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>300g caster sugar</li>
        <li>200g plain chocolate, chopped and melted (optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Halve the fruit and squeeze out the juice into a bowl. Keep to one side.</li>
        <li>Cut the peel into quarters, pulling out any of the membranes still inside, and put in a large pan. Cover generously with water, bring to the boil, simmer for 15 minutes, then drain. Repeat, this time simmering for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut off a small piece of peel to check it is done: it should be so soft you can rub it away between your fingers. Drain the peel.</li>
        <li>Once cool enough to handle, slice the peel into long strips.</li>
        <li>Put the granulated sugar in a pan with 500ml water. Heat gently until the sugar dissolves, then add the peel. Bring to the boil and simmer for 30-40 minutes until the peel and white pith is translucent. Add a splash of water if the syrup is going gummy – a sign it may be about to caramelise.</li>
        <li> Drain away any remaining syrup (cool and mix with the juice to make cordial, and store in the fridge). Lay the peel strips on a rack over a baking sheet and leave overnight, then transfer to trays lined with baking parchment and leave to dry further.</li>
        <li>Once the peel is tacky rather than sticky (one day in the airing cupboard, about two at room temperature) tip it on to a baking tray and dredge with the caster sugar. Turn to coat, then shake off the excess. Dip into melted chocolate if you like, allowing it to set, and store in an airtight container.</li>
      </ol>
