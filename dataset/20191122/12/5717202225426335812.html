      <h1>Report: Wolves could move for Bundesliga defender Robin Koch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:45:33+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/tom-procter/" target="_blank">Tom Procter</a></address>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers could make a January move for Freiburg defender Robin Koch.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10394414/leicester-transfer-kock-maguire-rodgers/">It has been suggested by The Sun</a> that the Black Country club could provide competition for Leicester City over the German centre-half, with Norwich City also named as possible suitors.</p>
      <p>Nuno Espirito Santo currently has Willy Boly out injured at Molineux, and loan defender Jesus Vallejo has not really impressed following his summer move from Real Madrid.</p>

      <p>The manager has shoehorned the likes of Matt Doherty, Romain Saiss and Leander Dendoncker into his back three in recent weeks, and the suggestion is that Wolves perhaps need more cover with a long season in store.</p>
      <p>Koch, 23, has been a mainstay for Freiburg this term, making 13 appearances in all competitions.</p>
      <p>The two-cap Germany international has impressed with some dominating performances, and is not on a particularly long contract (2021).</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Koch potentially a great pick-up</h3>
      <p>Koch – who is rated at around £15 million according to the report – is an impressive force at the back for Freiburg, and has been key in their rise to fourth in the Bundesliga table.</p>

      <p>Koch, who can also play in midfield, has been part of a side that has the joint-third best defensive record in the division so far, and could be a really good acquisition.</p>
      <p>The 6ft 3in star has previously been likened to Javi Martinez in terms of play style and position (<a href="https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/who-is-robin-koch-germany-defender-freiburg-s-javi-martinez-7430">bundesliga.com</a>), and arguably he would be good cover for Boly and also an upgrade on Ryan Bennett for when the Ivorian returns.</p>
