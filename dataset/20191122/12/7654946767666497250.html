      <h1>Smugglers busted after cutting hole in US-Mexico border wall</h1>

      <p>Sixteen people have been arrested in what the feds have described as a “brazen” smuggling attempt in which they cut through a portion of the wall along the US-Mexico border and entered Southern California, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Border Patrol agents spotted a white Dodge 4500 utility truck crossing into the US near Campo about 3:45 p.m. Wednesday after human smugglers cut a hole in the wall, officials said.</p>
      <p>A few minutes later, agents saw a man with a vehicle matching that description trying to cut a lock on the gate of a nearby home with bolt cutters.</p>
      <p>“Agents activated their emergency lights and siren to stop the suspect vehicle, but the driver refused to yield and fled,” border agents said.</p>
      <p>The truck eventually stopped and the driver and the 15 other people inside the vehicle began running before finally being collared, officials said.</p>
      <p>“All 16 admitted to entering the US illegally and were transported to a nearby Border Patrol station for processing,” according to the agency.</p>
      <p>Nine of the people were Mexican males ages 15 to 53, five were Mexican women ages 18 to 40 and two were Guatemalan — a 28-year-old man and a 29-year-old woman.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old Mexican driver’s stolen truck was seized and he “will be criminally prosecuted,” officials said.</p>
      <p>The breached wall, which is made of old landing mats, was constructed in the 1990s, <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/story/2019-11-21/smugglers-thwarted-after-making-brazen-smuggling-attempt-by">according to the San Diego Union-Tribune</a>.</p>
      <p>“A vehicle drive-thru, with overloaded and unsecured passengers, particularly in this terrain, can certainly result in a rollover accident with serious injuries and death,” San Diego Sector Interim Chief Douglas Harrison said, <a href="https://fox5sandiego.com/2019/11/21/16-arrested-after-cutting-through-border-wall-to-enter-us/">according to Fox 5 San Diego</a>.</p>
      <p>“The breach of this old landing mat wall is illustrative of the need for more hardened infrastructure with greater impedance and denial capabilities to keep the area secure.”</p>
