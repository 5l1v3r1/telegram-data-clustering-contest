      <p>The <b>US</b> will send a team of <b>energy experts</b> to help develop <b>Bulgaria</b> as an energy hub in the Balkans, <b>US</b> Ambassador to <b>Bulgaria</b> <b>Herro Mustafa</b> announced.</p>
      <p>Experts will visit Kozloduy and Belene NPPs as well as gas storage facilities in the country.</p>
      <p>"It is wonderful that <b>Bulgaria</b> has opportunities to supply gas from sources other than Russia. It is thus possible to diversify, that is, not to depend on just one country," the <b>US</b> ambassador emphasized.</p>
