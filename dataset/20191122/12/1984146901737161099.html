      <p>Seven football fans have been banned from the Stadium of Light ahead of Saturday's tense tie between <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland AFC</a> and Coventry City.</p>
      <p>Police have warned they will be taking a "zero-tolerance approach" this weekend after <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/sunderland-coventry-fans-fight-pub-16130308">trouble flared between the two teams' supporters</a> at previous games.</p>
      <p>And seven fans involved in disorder at April's home fixture will be unable to enter the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/stadium-of-light">Stadium of Light</a> on Saturday after receiving football banning orders.</p>

      <p>Violence broke out between the rival sets fans during and after the Black Cats' 5-4 defeat to the Sky Blues, on April 13.</p>
      <p>Several <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> supporters were said to have been injured after bottles and smoke bombs were thrown by away fans.</p>
      <p>And a brawl was said to have broken out inside The Wheatsheaf pub, on Roker Avenue, after the game.</p>
      <p>The disorder came after violent scenes when Sunderland travelled to Coventry in September 2018.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">Northumbria Police's</a> Chief Supt Sarah Pitt, who is in charge of policing at Saturday's game, has warned that anyone causing bother will be arrested.</p>

      <p>She said: "We enjoy a fantastic relationship with football fans across the North East who are some of the most passionate fans anywhere in the country. </p>
      <p>“But when passions are high, as was the case in this particular fixture last season, a small minority of fans can get caught up in disorder and ruin the spectacle for others.</p>
      <p>"We know this is a game that many supporters are looking forward to, and a visible policing presence will be seen both in the city centre and at the Stadium of Light to ensure those going to the match can enjoy it in a safe and hassle-free manner.</p>
      <p>"The safety of spectators and families out in the city centre is paramount, and as a result, we do not apologise for our zero-tolerance approach to violence and match-day disorder."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">Northumbria Police</a> launched an investigation, codenamed, named Operation Darwin, following April's game.</p>
      <p>As a result five North East fans and two from the Coventry area were handed football banning orders which forbid them from attending any regulated football match in the UK until 2024, which includes Premier League, Championship, League One, League Two and National League fixtures, as well as England home internationals. </p>
      <p>The banning orders, totalling more than 20 years, also prevent them from travelling abroad to watch international friendlies, qualification matches and tournaments.</p>
      <p>Several other supporters are still due to appear in court in connection with the disorder.</p>
      <p>Chief Supt Pitt added: "Our message is clear to anybody who is thinking of causing trouble on Saturday – you will be arrested, you will face criminal action and you may find yourself facing very serious consequences, including a custodial sentence and a banning order.</p>
      <p>“We would like to remind fans that banning orders not only prevent you from watching any regulated football match in the UK for a fixed period, but they can also affect your future career prospects as they may be disclosed to potential employers through a vetting process or DBS check.”</p>
