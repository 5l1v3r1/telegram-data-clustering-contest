      <p>REXBURG, Idaho (AP) — An Idaho university has stopped accepting Medicaid as health insurance coverage for full-time students amid concerns they said they received from local health care providers.</p>
      <p>Post Register reported Thursday that Brigham Young University-Idaho officials say students must buy a university-backed health plan, which can be purchased for at least $81 a month for single students and up to $678 a month for a family.</p>
      <p>Health officials say they were not in communication with the university before the change and they didn’t express concern about acquiring more Medicaid patients.</p>
      <p>Open enrollment for Medicaid expansion began Nov. 1.</p>
      <p>State health officials say Madison County has the highest concentration of potential Medicaid expansion enrollees in the state.</p>
      <p>University officials didn’t return requests for comment.</p>
      <p>Some students argue the university plan is too expensive.</p>
