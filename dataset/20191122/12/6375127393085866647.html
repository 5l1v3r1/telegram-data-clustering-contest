      <h1>Vapers can fight ban in court — IBP</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:42:15+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/hector-lawas" target="_blank">Hector Lawas</a></address>
      <h3>THE Integrated Bar of the Philippines yesterday said that the legality of President Duterte’s order banning the use of e-cigarettes in public, including its importation, can be challenged before the courts.</h3>
      <p>IBP national president Domingo Cayosa made the statement despite Duterte’s statement that he would not honor any court order stopping his bid to curtail vaping.</p>
      <p>“It’s a strong position by the President. He’s requesting the courts na huwag pakialaman ‘yung kaniyang paninindigan diyan, “ Cayosa said.</p>
      <p>“But at the end of the day, any citizen who feels aggrieved can actually go to the court,” he continued.</p>
      <p>Recently, Duterte said that he would soon issue an executive order on the vaping ban but noted that police officers can already arrest those vaping in public on the basis of a law that prohibits the distribution of toxic materials in public.</p>
      <p>He, however, did not name the specific law.</p>
      <p>“I do not want anyone in the Philippines vaping. The executive order will come,” he said in a speech during the 80th anniversary of the Department of National Defense.</p>
      <p>The President made the statement as the Philippine National Police began its crackdown on e-cigarette users.</p>
      <p>Duterte said he banned vaping to protect the health of Filipinos.</p>
      <p>“The e-cigarette is making it worse. There are chemicals that are added to nicotine which we do not know. And I am not about ready to allow the young people of the Philippines to get sick and to die,” he said.</p>
