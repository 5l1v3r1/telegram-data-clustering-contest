      <p>On Nov 14, a fire engulfed the power car and engine of a Rangpur Express train as it went off the tracks near the Ullapara Railway Station.</p>
      <p>The probe panel in its 29-page report drew up five recommendations while identifying the faults in the loop line as the reason for the accident, said the deputy commissioner.</p>

      <p>“It said that the stock rail and tongue rail at the scene had to be locked, but they weren’t. There was a gap between the two lines. That’s why the engine was derailed when it reached the spot.”</p>
      <p>The deputy commissioner refused to go into the details of the report. The administration will reveal the details after forwarding the report to the ministry, he said.</p>
