        <p>Self-proclaimed President of Single Mothers Akothee was hospitalized, barely a week after she returned to Kenya from abroad.</p>
        <p>In a picture seen by <i>Pulse Live</i>, Akothee was lying on a hospital bed with<a href="https://www.pulselive.co.ke/entertainment/akothee-hospitalized-days-after-returning-to-kenya-photo/bvr6gzp"> a drip on her hand</a>.</p>
        <p>She however, did not disclose the hospital she was admitted at.</p>
        <p>Madam Boss jetted back in the country on Tuesday, after a month of doing shows in the United States and staging a electrifying performance at the One Africa Fest, Dubai edition.</p>
        <p>Akothee's fans and friends took to the comment section to wish the mother of five a quick recovery.</p>
        <p>#UhondoMtaani would like to acknowledge that Akothee is one of the hardest working musicians in Kenya. This was evident as she landed at JKIA and went straight to work with the brands she represents as ambassador.</p>
        <p>Quick Recovery Madam Boss!!</p>

          <p>Comedians Eric Omondi and Churchill show’s Mammito have been warned by the Government after they shot a video with Kenya Scouts Association (KSA) uniform.</p>
          <p>In a statement, KSA Chief Commissioner Victor Radido said that Eric, Mammito and Mc Antonio who are seen wearing the uniform showed high misuse of the scout uniform, which taints the reputation of the organization.</p>
          <p>The Scouts Association called on the three to apologize and pull down any pictures or videos they uploaded online, adding that the uniform is protected by law just like those of disciplined forces, and its misuse attracts disciplinary actions.</p>
          <p>“<i>In view of the above, we call upon the pictured artists (Eric Omondi, Mammito and one more), who are great young leaders and role models in our country, and also in the interest of their brothers, sisters and fans, to apologize (Online) and pull down the images and related footages, and not to reuse them thereafter (Effective 22nd November 2019). The Association remains open to collaborate with them, and others, so as to effectively leverage on their passion, talent and great following to promote Scouting and good values in pour communities</i>,” said Radido.</p>
          <p>The warning came days after Eric Omondi, Mammito and Mc Antonio rocked the Scout Uniform as they recorded a skit that showed how the Mau Mau Freedom Fighters fought. The Skit was uploaded a day before Mashujaa Day (October 19).</p>

                <p>State House Spokesperson Kanze Dena moved the congregation at Rev. Lucy Natasha Church' as she took to the altar to give a testimony. Kanze preached for a few minutes, as she talked about how Rose Muhando's songs used to inspire her.</p>
                <p>Kanze revealed that when she was young, Rose Muhando’s songs gave her comfort because <a href="https://www.pulselive.co.ke/entertainment/state-house-spokesperson-kanze-dena-weds-nick-mararo-in-secret-wedding-ceremony-in/mxyegtr">she had a troubled past.</a></p>
                <p>She pointed out that she was experiencing a lot of challenges at the time and used to listen to the song ‘<i>Nipe Uvumilivu</i>’ and cry, challenging Gospel singers to be mindful of how their music impact people’s lives.</p>
                <p>Kanze disclosed that even as Ms Muhando underwent the challenges, she was following and always prayed for her.</p>
                <p>“<i>I want to speak two things, one to Rose Muhando and I want to use her as an example… Unajua ni kila saa wakati mimi nilipokuwa msichana mdogo Rose akiimba, nilikuwa nikisikiza nyimbo zake sana na kipindi kile nilikuwa napitia mapito makali sana katika maisha yangu na kuna wimbo wake unasema ‘Nimekukimbilia ewe bwana mwamba wangu na ngome yangu’ wimbo huo nilikuwa ninalia na ninatoa machozi. My first challenge is to every Gospel artiste, wimbo unaouimba unabadilisha maisha vipi? Wimbo wake huo mimi ulinifanya nikamfuata Rose Muhando na siku niliposikia kwamba kuna jambo limemtendekea na amepitia bonde la mauti, bila yeye kufahamu nilikuwa ninaomba na nilikuwa ninafuatilia</i>,” said Ms Dena.</p>

                  <p>Gospel singer Size 8 and hubby DJ MO welcomed their second born baby a few days ago.</p>
                  <p>The couple shared the experiences and struggles they have been through with the pregnancy, from the beginning to the delivery room.</p>
                  <p>In a video, a tearful Size 8 disclosed that upon learning that she was pregnant again months after experiencing a miscarriage, she panicked a lot.</p>
                  <p>She visited her doctor where she was given precautions but a few weeks later she experienced pressure attacks and pain in the uterus, which she later learned was fibroids.</p>
                  <p>The <i>Mateke</i> hit maker noted that she was rushed to the hospital (emergency) several times just to check if there was any organ damaged out of her recurrent blood pressure.</p>
                  <p>Size 8 pointed out that last week the <a href="https://www.pulselive.co.ke/entertainment/tearful-size-8-opens-up-on-pregnancy-struggles-after-welcoming-new-born-through-c/lxjve9d">twitching became unbearable</a>, and she could not feel her baby move anymore.</p>
                  <p><i>“So they finally decided for me to be re-admitted. So I came here at RFH. I came here and i couldn’t breath and couldn’t walk, I was completely off, I was rushed up for checkup, checked my pressure and of course that of the unborn baby. They put me on oxygen to help with the neurons, as they said they were the ones that were dysfunctional, then I felt better</i>," said Size 8<i>.</i></p>
                  <p><i>“At around 3 o’clock, the fetus heart rate went high again, past 170. There was an emergence in the room making sure the heartbeat goes back to normal. The next day Dr. Thuo came with his wife and they were trying to buy more time, because the scan we had was saying it was 34 weeks 4 days. So when they tested the heart rate ya mtoi was so high and they couldn’t buy more time. So they decided that we have to go to the theater because I was already at RFH so they decided I get ready for a C-section,”</i> she added.</p>
                  <p>After the caesarian-section the baby was rushed to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).</p>
