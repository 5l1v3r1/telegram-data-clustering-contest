      <h1>Burton paper girl left to walk in torrential rain as yobs steal her bike</h1>
      <h2>She was doing extra newspaper deliveries because of the heavy rain that day</h2>

      <p>A Burton student had her bike cruelly stolen while on her paper round - leaving her to walk for an hour in the pouring rain.</p>
      <p>Wendy Roper-Knight has issued an appeal to the public to <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/traffic-and-travel">locate her missing bike</a>.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old NHS worker's daughter, Freya was using it for her paper round in Rolleston on Thursday, November 14, because her own cycle had a flat tyre.</p>
      <p>It came the day torrential rain flooded the area, leaving roads closed and houses wrecked.</p>
      <p>Freya, 16, was doing three rounds, covering for colleagues who had to get to school because the rain had made the paper delivery van late.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/education">Burton and South Derbyshire College</a> student had a day off and volunteered to fill in on an unfamiliar route in Hall Road, Rolleston.</p>

      <p>Mrs Roper-Knight, who has used the bike in triathlons, including in Derby, said the bike was taken between 8am and 8.20am.</p>
      <p>The mum of two said: "She'd left the bike resting against a house and gone to deliver some papers, but when she came back it was gone.</p>
      <p>"We thought at first maybe she'd just forgotten where she'd left it.</p>
      <p>"I thought maybe because of the rain someone might have thought it was abandoned and taken it in, but we've knocked around and nobody has seen anything.</p>
      <p>"It was raining at the time - <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/weather">absolutely hammering it down</a> - but even after losing the bike she still had another round to do, so was out there for another hour."</p>
      <p>Freya has held a paper round for more than a year, but has never had an experience like this before.</p>
      <p>Mrs Roper-Knight said: "She was drenched when she got back, absolutely soaked.</p>
      <p>"She was a bit confused. No-one can understand why someone would take it.</p>
      <p>"It's a small road, a lovely area. It feels so unlikely that anyone would take it; no one can believe it was stolen.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully it still is the case <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/traffic-and-travel">that someone's just taken it</a> in thinking it was abandoned."</p>
      <p>Luckily, Freya is still able to do her paper round, as her own bike's tyre has now been fixed.</p>
