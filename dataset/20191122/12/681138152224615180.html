      <p>Eamonn O'Nolan has handed over the mayoral chain and robes just six months after being elected as Woodbridge's first citizen to the new mayor, Liberal Democrat councillor Patrick Gillard.</p>
      <p>It comes just weeks after Mr O'Nolan was arrested at the Extinction Rebellion rally in London dressed in the mayoral robes as part of the climate change protests.</p>
      <p>However, his arrest has nothing to do with the mayoral change - which was agreed six months ago after the council elections.</p>
      <p>Traditionally the position of mayor is held for one year but Woodbridge Town Council has implemented changes to this old style structure in favour of a fresh approach.</p>

      <p>It is part of larger changes to the town council, including changes to its committee structure with more power being delegated to individual committees.</p>
      <p>Mr O'Nolan had an eventful six months as mayor.</p>
      <p>He was arrested at the cimate change protests in October by the Metropolitan Police and taken into custody in Brixton but he was not charged and was released under investigation.</p>

      <p>He was also prevalent in the case of two dead bodies found in sheltered accommodation in Mussidan Place in Woodbridge after attending as a first responder and regularly met with residents and local authorities to try to prevent the shocking circumstances from happening again.</p>
      <p>Mr O'Nolan congratulated Mr Gillard and said: "I've enjoyed it hugely, and as a council we have managed to get a number of projects off the ground including the climate emergency declaration, the first Car Free Day and the Community Cafe.</p>
      <p>"Six months wasn't long enough."</p>
      <p>Mr Gillard appointed his wife Liberal Democrat county councillor Caroline Page as his consort and writing on his Facebook page said: "I am honoured to have been elected chair of Woodbridge Town Council and Mayor of Woodbridge till the end of this council year.</p>

      <p>"There are loads of great things we can do.</p>
      <p>"On behalf of all councillors and the town, I'd like to thank councillor O'Nolan for his excellent six months' service."</p>
