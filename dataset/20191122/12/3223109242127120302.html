      <h1>Twitter Rolls Out ‘Hide Replies’ Feature Globally</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:46:33+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/stephanie_m/" target="_blank">Stephanie Mlot</a></address>
      <p>Twitter now offers everyone the option to hide replies.</p>
      <p>Following <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/twitter-lets-users-hide-replies-in-us-japan-1804687/">successful pilots in North America and Japan</a>, the <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/twitter-will-stop-accepting-all-political-ads-starting-in-november-1809013/">social network</a> is rolling out the new feature across the tweeting world.</p>
      <p>Distracting, irrelevant, and offensive comments can quickly derail important discussions. But don’t get mad, get even—by burying unwanted remarks.</p>

      <p>Users can still see and engage with sequestered statement by tapping the grey icon that will appear in the corner of tweets.</p>
      <p>“This way, you have more control over the conversations you start, but people can still see the entire conversation,” product manager Suzanne Xie wrote in <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2019/more-control-over-your-conversations-globally.html">a blog announcement</a>.</p>
      <p>Initial research suggests people typically hide replies they find irrelevant, abusive, or unintelligible; most found it helpful, like muting keywords.</p>
      <p>Some, however, worried that hiding a reply could be misunderstood, potentially leading to confusion or frustration. So, <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/twitter-very-sorry-it-misused-security-data-for-ads-1806766/">Twitter</a> now checks with users to see if they also want to block that account.</p>
      <p>A way to shut out noise, this new attraction appears to have a positive effect on the community: An impressive 27 percent of people (in Canada) who had their tweets hidden said they would reconsider how they interact with others in the future.</p>
      <p>The function is available globally on iOS, Android, Twitter Lite, and <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/twitters-new-website-mirrors-its-mobile-app-1795933/">twitter.com</a>.</p>
      <p>“Looking ahead, we’re working on new controls and more clarity around the rules of conversation spaces,” Xie said.</p>
      <p>That includes a new hide replies endpoint, so developers can build additional conversation management tools.</p>
      <p>“We’re exploring more options around who can reply to or see specific conversations, and are testing engagement changes to see if these lead to healthier discussions,” she continued. “We’re committed to making sure people feel safe and comfortable talking on Twitter.”</p>
      <p>The social media giant in August began testing a <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/twitter-tests-subscribe-to-replies-feature-1799756/">subscribe-to-replies option</a>—currently open to reviewers on iOS and Android.</p>
