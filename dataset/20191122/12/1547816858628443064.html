        <b>Oh No! Boman Irani’s loss was actor Annu Kapoor’s gain. The actor confessed to being offered the role of Dr Baldev Chaddha in Vicky Donor. However, due to his date issues, the role was passed on to actor Annu Kapoor. Though Boman regretted the same, he appreciated Annu for doing full justice to the character onscreen</b>

      <p>Versatile actor Boman Irani definitely knows how to keep his audience entertained. Be it his bang-on sense of humour in the Munnabhai series or his grey role in Dilwale, or the mean professor in 3 Idiots, the actor has proved his mettle. Though he set his foot in the entertainment business at the age of 41, there was no looking back for the actor, all thanks to his impeccable acting prowess. The actor is loved by all the age groups for his effortless portrayal of different roles on screen.  </p>
      <p>In conversation with a publication, the actor revealed being approached for a role in Ayushmann Khurrana’s debut film Vicky Donor. Yes! You read it right. The actor confessed of being offered the role of Dr Baldev Chaddha in the movie. However, unfortunately, the actor had to let it go, due to date issues in 2012. Thus, landing this crucial character in the lap of Annu Kapoor. Boman Irani said to Hindustan Times, “I do regret not being able to do this film. I was offered the part of Dr Baldev Chaddha (that was played Annu Kapoor in the film). I loved the story and my character but did not have dates at that time. Tried managing things, but it did not work out and I had to let go of the offer.” ALSO READ: <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/Bollywood-interviews/made-in-china-is-just-a-few-hours-away-from-its-release-and-in-the-midst-of-their-promotional-spree-we-caught-up-with-rajkummar-rao-and-boman-irani-who-are-selling-this-idea-as-the-entire-nation-is-hooked-to-the-make-in-india-concept-watch-the-exclusive-interview/5db1acb687fb571eff7e2fa4">EXCLUSIVE Interview: Rajkummar Rao And Boman Irani Talk About Made In China Amidst 'Make In India' Mantra</a></p>

      <p>Though regretting to be unable to give a nod to this project in 2012, the actor appreciated Annu Kapoor for doing full justice to it. According to Boman, nobody other than Annu would have played this character so thoroughly. </p>
      <p>Praising Annu, Boman said, “When I watched the film later, I felt that no one could have played the character of Dr. Baldev Chaddha better than Annu Kapoor. He was fabulous in the film. It does feel bad letting go of such an offer, but then such things happen with everyone.”</p>
