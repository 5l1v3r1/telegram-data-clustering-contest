      <p>Qatar has reiterated its commitment to the implementation of the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, stressing that it gives the issue of child protection, especially the right to education, the highest priority</p>
      <p>Qatar noted that it collaborates with international partners to reach quality education services for 10 million children around the world through the initiatives launched by Education Above All Foundation (EAA).</p>
      <p>This came in a speech delivered by Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations Ambassador, H E Sheikha Alya bint Saif Al Thani, at the high-level meeting of the UN General Assembly to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the UN adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which Qatar was among the first countries to ratify it.</p>
      <p>Ambassador H E Sheikha Alya noted the State of Qatar’s support, as it contributed a $50m to support education services provided by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to Palestine refugees in Jordan, Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Syria and Lebanon.</p>
      <p>She also referred to Amir H H Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani’s announcement in 2018 of Qatar’s pledge to provide quality education to another one million girls by 2021.</p>
      <p>As part of the State Qatar’s efforts to support peace-building and the rehabilitation of child soldiers, it pledged $88m to the UN Fund for Recovery, Reconstruction and Development in Darfur, she said, noting in this context the implementation of a social and economic rehabilitation program for demobilized soldiers, including children.</p>
      <p>She also referred to the State of Qatar’s support to rebuild five service complexes in five villages in Darfur, including water stations, primary and secondary schools and a police station in order to create an enabling environment for children.</p>
      <p>Regarding the child’s right to health care, Sheikha Alya said that Qatar provided $70m to assist in the rehabilitation of water and sanitation systems project in Yemen to combat cholera and improve access to safe drinking water that benefits about 8.5 million Yemenis, including about 4.25 million children.</p>
      <p>She expressed Qatar’s pride of its close partnership with Unicef in the implementation of many projects and programs, which have contributed to saving the lives of children, defending their rights and helping them to realize their potential, adding that this partnership culminated recently in the provision of $8m in financial support to Unicef’s core resources for the period (2019-2020), as well as the opening of a Unicef office soon in Doha.</p>
      <p>Qatar is preparing to open the analysis and communication center of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict in Doha, which would contribute significantly to enhancing knowledge and skills related to the protection of children affected by armed conflict in the region, she said. She welcomed the launch of the results of the Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty on November 18, 2019, in Geneva, in which Qatar contributed $100,000.</p>
