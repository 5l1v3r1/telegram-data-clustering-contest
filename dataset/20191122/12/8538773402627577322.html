      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/game/_/gameId/401128008">Seahawks (8-2) at Eagles (5-5)</a>
      </h3>
      <p><b>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET</b> | <b>Fox</b><br/><b>Matchup rating:</b> 71.6 | <b><a href="http://insider.espn.com/insider/pickcenter/nfl/game?gameid=401128008">Spread</a>:</b> PHI -1 (48)</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> While standout right tackle <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15797/lane-johnson">Lane Johnson</a> remains in concussion protocol, the Eagles have been working rookie <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3127264/andre-dillard">Andre Dillard</a>, who has been trained at left tackle, on the right side in anticipation of Johnson's absence. Seattle defensive end <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16734/jadeveon-clowney">Jadeveon Clowney</a> lines up mostly on that side, which could make for a hairy day for <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2573079/carson-wentz">Carson Wentz</a>. <i>-- Tim McManus</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> The Seahawks will sack Wentz four times. That qualifies as bold for a pass rush that was a major disappointment until it got to <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16760/jimmy-garoppolo">Jimmy Garoppolo</a> five times two weeks ago. The Seahawks are coming off a bye and finally have something close to the pass rush they envisioned with <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577078/quinton-jefferson">Quinton Jefferson</a> healthy, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115312/jarran-reed">Jarran Reed</a> rounding into form and Clowney continuing to dominate. <i>-- Brady Henderson</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> Seahawks running back <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3919596/chris-carson">Chris Carson</a> has recorded a rushing touchdown in each of his past three road games. The only Seattle players to do so in four consecutive road games over the past 15 seasons are Shaun Alexander (seven straight in 2005) and Marshawn Lynch (four straight in 2011).</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> Eagles tight end <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15835/zach-ertz">Zach Ertz</a> is the only tight end to have caught at least nine passes in consecutive games this season, and three of the top four tight end performances against the Seahawks this season have come away from Seattle. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 12 rankings</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Betting nugget:</b> Seattle has covered in seven straight games as a road underdog, including the playoffs. It is 3-0 outright this season as a road underdog. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/chalk/insider/story/_/id/28117435/week-12-nfl-best-bets-number-each-game">Read more</a>.</i></p>

        <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/game/_/gameId/401127870">Buccaneers (3-7) at Falcons (3-7)</a>
      </h3>
      <p><b>1 p.m. ET</b> | <b>Fox</b><br/><b>Matchup rating:</b> 52.2 | <b><a href="http://insider.espn.com/insider/pickcenter/nfl/game?gameid=401127870">Spread</a>:</b> ATL -4 (51)</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> The Falcons have 13 sacks and 25 quarterback hits over the past three games. They should be able to keep up the pressure against the Bucs' <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2969939/jameis-winston">Jameis Winston</a>, who has been sacked a league-high 36 times. An improved pass rush has allowed the Falcons to start creating turnovers, with four interceptions last weekend. Winston also has a league-high 18 picks. <i>-- Vaughn McClure</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> Winston will throw two more interceptions against a rejuvenated Falcons defense that pressured Carolina's <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115293/kyle-allen">Kyle Allen</a> heavily last weekend and picked him off four times. And Atlanta receivers <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13982/julio-jones">Julio Jones</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3925357/calvin-ridley">Calvin Ridley</a> will combine for over 200 receiving yards against a young Tampa Bay secondary that's giving up 371.8 yards per game. <i>-- Jenna Laine</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> Bucs receiver <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16737/mike-evans">Mike Evans</a> is just seven yards shy of his sixth consecutive season with 1,000 receiving yards. He'd join Randy Moss (2003) as the only players in NFL history with 1,000 receiving yards in each of their first six seasons.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> Atlanta's Jones has gone seven straight games without a touchdown after scoring in seven straight. The most recent time he went seven games in a row in a season without a touchdown, he responded with 25.1 fantasy points and a WR4 finish for the week. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 12 rankings</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Betting nugget:</b> Tampa Bay is 2-8 against the spread (ATS) this season, the worst mark in the NFL. It has failed to cover in six straight games, the longest active streak in the league. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/chalk/insider/story/_/id/28117435/week-12-nfl-best-bets-number-each-game">Read more</a>.</i></p>

      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/game/_/gameId/401127922">Panthers (5-5) at Saints (8-2)</a>
      </h3>
      <p><b>1 p.m. ET</b> | <b>CBS</b><br/><b>Matchup rating:</b> 51.7 | <b><a href="http://insider.espn.com/insider/pickcenter/nfl/game?gameid=401127922">Spread</a>:</b> NO -10 (47)</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> This is about as "must-win" as it gets for the Panthers, who are now three games behind New Orleans in the NFC South after losing three of the past four. And they'll be relying on <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117251/christian-mccaffrey">Christian McCaffrey</a> to threaten one of the NFL's most underrated streaks: The Saints have not allowed a 100-yard rusher in 36 consecutive games, including the playoffs. <i>-- Mike Triplett</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> McCaffrey will rush for 150 yards against a defense allowing only 85.3 per game. He'll do it because quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115293/kyle-allen">Kyle Allen</a> will get back to being a game manager and relying on his playmakers instead of trying to make things happen as he has done the past four weeks, resulting in nine interceptions. <i>-- David Newton</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> Carolina's Allen has a 1-3 record, 59% completion percentage, 6.3 yards per attempt and 3-9 touchdown-to-interception ratio over the past four games. He began his season as a starter with a 4-0 record, 66% completion percentage, 7.4 yards per attempt and 7-0 TD-INT ratio.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> Saints receiver <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976316/michael-thomas">Michael Thomas</a> has been a top-15 receiver in each of his past seven games and is on pace for 379.5 fantasy points this season, a total among WRs that only Antonio Brown and Randy Moss have touched since 2003. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 12 rankings</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Betting nugget:</b> Over the past five seasons, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2580/drew-brees">Drew Brees</a> is 16-8 ATS in division games and 8-4 ATS at home. However, three of the four home losses came as at least nine-point favorites, including a Week 10 loss against Atlanta. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/chalk/insider/story/_/id/28117435/week-12-nfl-best-bets-number-each-game">Read more</a>.</i></p>

        <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/game/_/gameId/401127919">Dolphins (2-8) at Browns (4-6)</a>
      </h3>
      <p><b>1 p.m. ET</b> | <b>Fox</b><br/><b>Matchup rating:</b> 34.4 | <b><a href="http://insider.espn.com/insider/pickcenter/nfl/game?gameid=401127919">Spread</a>:</b> CLE -11 (45.5)</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> How will a depleted Browns defensive line cope without three starters, including tackle <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3050122/larry-ogunjobi">Larry Ogunjobi</a> and end <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14982/olivier-vernon">Olivier Vernon</a>, assuming the latter remains out with a knee injury? Of course, not having star pass-rusher Myles Garrett will be a challenge to overcome too -- this game and beyond. <i>-- Jake Trotter</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> Cleveland's <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128720/nick-chubb">Nick Chubb</a> will rush for a season high of 165-plus yards. The Dolphins have the 31st-ranked run defense, allowing 148.3 yards per game, and with recent injuries in the secondary, it seems possible they will overcompensate on the back end to protect their young defensive backs. <i>-- Cameron Wolfe</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> Chubb has 607 rushing yards before first contact this season, the fourth most in the NFL. The Dolphins have allowed 653 (second most in the NFL).</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> Six times this season has a receiver scored more than 21 fantasy points against the Dolphins. And <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16733/odell-beckham-jr">Odell Beckham Jr.</a> has seen double-digit targets in consecutive games for the first time this season. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 12 rankings</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Betting nugget:</b> This is the second time since the franchise returned to Cleveland in 1999 that the Browns have been a double-digit favorite. The other time was in Week 17 of 2007, when Cleveland beat San Francisco 20-7 as a 13.5-point home favorite. That is the longest drought by any team without being a double-digit favorite. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/chalk/insider/story/_/id/28117435/week-12-nfl-best-bets-number-each-game">Read more</a>.</i></p>

Both teams also possess elite cornerbacks in <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3042717/tre'davious-white">Tre'Davious White</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14398/chris-harris-jr">Chris Harris Jr.</a>, who could make things difficult for the wideouts. <i>-- Marcel Louis-Jacques</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> If the Broncos keep Bills quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen">Josh Allen</a> under 50% in completion rate, they'll pull the upset. The Broncos have the league's No. 4 pass defense and rank No. 8 in scoring defense, but they have allowed a 66% completion rate overall this season. In the Bills' three losses, Allen has been held to 46.4%, 47.1% and 53.7%. Those are also the only three times he's been below 60% this season. <i>-- Jeff Legwold</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> The Broncos have a 28.5% conversion rate on third down this season (third worst in NFL), while the Bills have the sixth-best rate allowed (34.6%).</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> The Bills' Brown was the top-scoring player in fantasy last week and has over 50 receiving yards in all 10 of Buffalo's games. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 12 rankings</a>.</i></p>

      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> The Giants have allowed 34 sacks on the season, but Chicago's star pass-rusher, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16710/khalil-mack">Khalil Mack</a>, is in a funk. Mack has just one sack over the past six games, and he failed to record a single tackle in the Bears' loss to the Rams last weekend. <i>-- Jeff Dickerson</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> Yes, Mack might have only 5.5 sacks this season, but he gets three Sunday against the Giants. The Giants' offensive line hasn't played well, and right tackle <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15422/mike-remmers">Mike Remmers</a> has struggled while dealing with a back injury. It sets up for Mack to do some major damage. <i>-- Jordan Raanan</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> The Bears have scored the fifth-fewest points per game this season (16.9), but the Giants' defense is allowing 28.9 (third most in the NFL).</p>

      <p><b>Betting nugget:</b> New York is 9-4 ATS on the road over the past two seasons. One of the "road" ATS losses came in Week 10 when it was the road team against the Jets.

      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> The Jets can validate their two-game winning streak over bad teams with a victory over a quality opponent. Their top-ranked run defense will be tested by rookie running back <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4047365/josh-jacobs">Josh Jacobs</a>. Since allowing a 66-yard run by <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115364/leonard-fournette">Leonard Fournette</a> in Week 8, the defense has allowed only 183 rushing yards on 88 carries for a 2.1 average. <i>-- Rich Cimini</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> The Raiders will not allow a sack by Jets safety <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115373/jamal-adams">Jamal Adams</a>, who is coming off a three-sack game and has six on the season. "If you don't account for that guy," Raiders quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16757/derek-carr">Derek Carr</a> said, "he can ruin a football game." <i>-- Paul Gutierrez</i></p>

      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> Since Week 5, there are two running backs with multiple games of 110 rushing yards and at least three receptions: <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117251/christian-mccaffrey">Christian McCaffrey</a> and Jacobs (both have three such games over that stretch). <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 12 rankings</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Betting nugget:</b> This is the second time in the current Jon Gruden era (since 2018) that Oakland has been a road favorite.

Overall, Oakland is 4-8 ATS in all road games in that span (3-8 in past 11 games). <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/chalk/insider/story/_/id/28117435/week-12-nfl-best-bets-number-each-game">Read more</a>.</i></p>

      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> The Redskins can tie a franchise record (1960-61 seasons) if they lose their 10th straight game at home Sunday. But the Lions are 1-3-1 on the road this season and 1-21 all time when playing at Washington. <i>-- John Keim</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> Washington quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040616/dwayne-haskins">Dwayne Haskins</a> will throw three touchdown passes and two interceptions. The Lions have allowed two or more passing touchdowns in each of the past six games and haven't recorded an interception since Oct. 14.

The rookie has missed the past three games after minor knee surgery, but he practiced fully Wednesday. With <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045147/james-conner">James Conner</a>'s aggravated shoulder injury, the Steelers once again need a running back to step up and fill his spot.

      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> The Bengals are already eliminated from postseason contention. Week 11 matches the earliest a team has been eliminated since at least 2002 (the 2014 Raiders and 2008 Lions are only teams since 2002 to be eliminated earlier by date).</p>

      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> The Jaguars' 29th-rated run defense (134 yards per game) will be determined to keep <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3043078/derrick-henry">Derrick Henry</a> from having another outstanding performance against it. Even though Jacksonville held Henry to only 44 yards in the previous meeting, this weekend should give offensive coordinator Arthur Smith another opportunity to focus on the running game. <i>-- Turron Davenport</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115364/leonard-fournette">Leonard Fournette</a> will get 20 carries for the Jaguars. The Jags have neglected him the past two games (over that time, 11 first-half carries and 19 total); coach Doug Marrone said they'll be recommitted to the running game, so Fournette will get a heavy workload. It won't be easy, though. The Titans are giving up 102.5 yards per game on the ground and have allowed just five rushing scores all season. <i>-- Mike DiRocco</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> Since Henry entered the league in 2016, no running back has scored more touchdowns against the Jaguars than Henry. In fact, his eight touchdowns are five more than the closest backs (Lamar Miller and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117251/christian-mccaffrey">Christian McCaffrey</a>, with three each).</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> Fournette has never rushed for 70-plus yards against the Titans, and he has failed to score in three straight matchups with the division rival. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 12 rankings</a>.</i></p>

        <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/game/_/gameId/401127957">Cowboys (6-4) at Patriots (9-1)</a>
      </h3>
      <p><b>4:25 p.m. ET</b> | <b>Fox</b><br/><b>Matchup rating:</b> 85.9 | <b><a href="http://insider.espn.com/insider/pickcenter/nfl/game?gameid=401127957">Spread</a>:</b> NE -6.5 (45)</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> Cowboys coach Jason Garrett noted the Patriots' knack for winning the turnover differential (No. 1 in the NFL at plus-18), while the Cowboys are minus-1 on the season (12 takeaways, 13 giveaways). The turnover battle could be key Sunday. <i>-- Mike Reiss</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady">Tom Brady</a> will pass for 300 yards against the Cowboys. Brady has five 300-yard games this season but none in the past four. Since 2010, Brady has had just three five-game spans of not having at least 300 yards passing. <i>-- Todd Archer</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> The Cowboys lead the NFL in total offense this season (444.6 yards per game) and have the most efficient offense per FPI. But the Patriots lead the NFL in total defense (249.9 opponent yards per game) and have the most efficient defense per FPI. The Patriots have allowed just nine offensive touchdowns.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> The Cowboys have three of the top 12 receivers over the past three weeks, but they face a Patriots defense this weekend that is allowing a league-low 22.5 fantasy points to receivers this season and is on pace to have the lowest WR fantasy points per game average against since the 2009 Jets. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 12 rankings</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Betting nugget:</b> New England has covered seven consecutive games against NFC opponents, including the Super Bowl (7-1 ATS since the start of last season). Overall, Brady is 44-24-2 ATS in his career against NFC teams in the regular season. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/chalk/insider/story/_/id/28117435/week-12-nfl-best-bets-number-each-game">Read more</a>.</i></p>

        <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/game/_/gameId/401128004">Packers (8-2) at 49ers (9-1)</a>
      </h3>
      <p><b>8:20 p.m. ET</b> | <b>NBC</b><br/><b>Matchup rating:</b> 84.9 | <b><a href="http://insider.espn.com/insider/pickcenter/nfl/game?gameid=401128004">Spread</a>:</b> SF -3 (47.5)</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> This will be a battle of the NFC's top two seeds and one that pits two of the sharpest young branches of the Shanahan coaching tree against each other: Kyle Shanahan and Matt LaFleur. Expect two offenses that look similar, but the team that emerges with a huge victory in the NFC playoff picture will be the one that takes better care of the ball. <i>-- Nick Wagoner</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> Two trends will be broken in this game: The Packers will hurt the 49ers with at least one deep ball, and it will come at the hands of <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051738/marquez-valdes-scantling">Marquez Valdes-Scantling</a> -- who despite ranking tied for second in the NFL with five catches of 40-plus yards this season has only one reception of any kind in the past three games. <i>-- Rob Demovsky</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> The Packers have played man coverage 56% of the time this season, the sixth-highest rate in the NFL using ESPN's coverage metrics. Niners QB <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16760/jimmy-garoppolo">Jimmy Garoppolo</a> ranks top five in the NFL in completion rate, yards per dropback and Total QBR against man.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> Excluding the injury-plagued 2017 season that saw him miss time around the bye week, Packers quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers">Aaron Rodgers</a> has failed to score even 16 fantasy points in the week following a bye three consecutive times. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 12 rankings</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Betting nugget:</b> Green Bay is 6-0 outright and 5-1 ATS against teams that entered with winning records this season. That includes two games as an underdog, which Green Bay won outright both times. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/chalk/insider/story/_/id/28117435/week-12-nfl-best-bets-number-each-game">Read more</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Demovsky's pick: </b>49ers 31, Packers 28<br/><b>Wagoner's pick:</b> 49ers 34, Packers 27<br/><b>FPI prediction:</b> SF, 60.8% (by an average of 3.7 points)</p>

      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/game/_/gameId/401128012">Ravens (8-2) at Rams (6-4)</a>
      </h3>
      <p><b>Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET</b> | <b>ESPN/<a href="https://www.espn.com/watch/">ESPN App</a></b><br/><b>Matchup rating:</b> 89.6 | <b><a href="http://insider.espn.com/insider/pickcenter/nfl/game?gameid=401128012">Spread</a>:</b> BAL -3 (46.5)</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> The Rams' defense has allowed a league-low 11 points per game over its past four games, which happens to coincide with the arrival of cornerback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045373/jalen-ramsey">Jalen Ramsey</a>. However, most of those games were against teams with struggling offenses, including the Bengals, Steelers and Bears. The Ravens come to Los Angeles as the NFL's top-scoring team, averaging 34.1 points per game. This will be the new-look Rams defense's first true test, and it'll be against a quarterback who is the front-runner to win MVP. <i>-- Lindsay Thiry</i></p>
      <p><b>Bold prediction:</b> Ravens cornerback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2578378/marcus-peters">Marcus Peters</a> exacts some revenge against his former team and sets an NFL record with another pick-six. Peters would become the first player in league history to score defensive touchdowns in three consecutive road games, according to Elias Sports Bureau research. <i>-- Jamison Hensley</i></p>
      <p><b>Stat to know:</b> The Rams run the second-most plays per game with at least three wide receivers (52.4 per game). Without <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16731/brandin-cooks">Brandin Cooks</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15880/robert-woods">Robert Woods</a> last weekend, they ran just 17 snaps with three wide receivers, by far their fewest in a game in the Sean McVay era. Without those receivers, L.A. had designed runs on 62% of plays, its highest mark in the past two seasons.</p>
      <p><b>What to know for fantasy:</b> The Ravens' <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson">Lamar Jackson</a> has been a top-three quarterback seven times this season and is on pace to score 16.7 more fantasy points than <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes">Patrick Mahomes</a> did in his historic 2018. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/fantasy/football/story/_/page/WeeklyRanks19QBPPR/fantasy-football-weekly-quarterback-rankings-2019">See Week 12 rankings</a>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Betting nugget:</b> Since moving to Los Angeles, the Rams are 1-7-1 ATS as a home underdog (0-7-1 in their past eight games), including 0-4 with <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff">Jared Goff</a> and 0-2 under McVay. <i><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/chalk/insider/story/_/id/28117435/week-12-nfl-best-bets-number-each-game">Read more</a>.</i></p>
