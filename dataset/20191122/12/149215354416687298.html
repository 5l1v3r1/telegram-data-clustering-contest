      <p>Everybody has a dream. And if you have the top-rated late night talk show, your network might even bankroll it for you.</p>
      <p>No matter what you think of Stephen Colbert's politics, his knowledge of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth in unimpeachable. New Zealand "is such a beautiful country, such a magical place, that I'm not surprised it was used as the locations for Middle Earth in the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and the <i>Hobbit</i> trilogies," he said on Thursday's <i>Late Show</i>. "And as you may know, writer and director Peter Jackson cast me in <i>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug</i>. I had the very important role of Lake-town spy. So when I was back in New Zealand, I sat down with my friend Peter and talked with him about the next logical step in the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> movie franchise."</p>
      <p>Colbert's pitch to Jackson involved the human protagonist of the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy, Aragorn. "What about this for a backstory?" Colbert asked. "My character is actually Aragorn's slightly hotter twin brother, Darrylgorn." Jackson declined to direct this literary abomination, of course, but he agreed to make a cameo. And Colbert had a trailer for his Darrylgorn spinoff ready to roll. It is quite silly, and it doesn't even make any sense, really — Aragorn would have been <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/54235-how-old-would-aragorn-be-at-the-time-of-the-hobbit-the-battle-of-the-five">about 10 years old during</a> the <i>Hobbit</i> movies Colbert's adult character appeared in, for example.</p>
      <p>But that's beside the point. This is a self-referential, winking labor of love. The three <i>Lord of the Rings</i> movies and three <i>Hobbit</i> movies were box office hits, "and now, after 1,179 minutes, the real saga finally begins," the voiceover to the trailer intones. Watch below. Peter Weber</p>
