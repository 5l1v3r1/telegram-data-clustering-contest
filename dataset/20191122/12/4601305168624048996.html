      <p>In a move that is so bombastic yet embarrassing that it sounds like something straight out <i>This is Spinal Tap</i><i>—</i>ya know what, let's just let <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-18/kiss-plays-one-off-concert-for-great-white-sharks/11714340">ABC Australia</a> fill us in:</p>
      <blockquote>[KISS] cancelled its other [Australian] concerts after lead singer Paul Stanley pulled out due to illness.<br/><br/>But a line-up featuring bass guitarist Gene Simmons, lead guitarist Tommy Thayer, and drummer Eric Singer took to the seas as part of an Airbnb promotion designed to promote tourism locations around the world.<br/><br/>The concert was billed as KISS playing to great white sharks — although no sharks actually turned up.</blockquote>
      <p>That's it. That's what actually happened. In <i>Australia</i>, of all places. There were reportedly <i>eight people</i> who paid actual currency to watch this stunt on the boat, along with some media people and stray boaters, for a total estimated crowd of <i>maybe</i> 50 people. Watching 3/4 of KISS perform with a terrible sound system. Okay.</p>
      <p>The event was hosted by <a href="https://adventurebaycharters.com.au/">Adventure Bay Charters</a>, a company that apparently promises "shark cage diving" adventures in the waters around Australia. Hence, the concert was supposed to demonstrate the company's ability to attract sharks for the experience using sound waves instead of blood…except that the whole thing failed in that regard.</p>
