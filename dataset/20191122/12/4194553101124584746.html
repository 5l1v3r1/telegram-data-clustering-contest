      <h1>Klopp gives sacked Pochettino advice about his next move</h1>

      <p>Jurgen Klopp spoke about Mauricio Pochettino today and was very kind about the Argentine who was this week sacked by Spurs and replaced by Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>The German is now the 3rd longest serving manager in the top flight following Poch’s exit, and Klopp thinks his friend deserves a nice long break away from the game.</p>
      <p>In fact, he advised on two occasions that it’s the smart thing to do before getting into another high level job.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“He did a brilliant job at Tottenham. Outstanding coach, great guy. I enjoyed the games against him, we have a history together,” Klopp said, reported by <a href="https://talksport.com/football/633212/jurgen-klopp-press-conference-liverpool-manager-jose-mourinho-pochettino/">talkSPORT</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“When I first heard it, I couldn’t believe it in that moment. I really hope he can enjoy a few days, weeks or months off. Jose is motivated highly, so it will be interesting.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“My first Premier League game was against him so we have a history.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Any job that is available he will be in contention.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Everything will be fine for him, but it was a big one, when I first heard I couldn’t believe it. I hope Mauricio can enjoy a few weeks off.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Klopp himself had a short sabbatical after leaving Borussia Dortmund before being appointed by Liverpool four years ago – and we can imagine he’ll do the same when he eventually departs Anfield.</p>
      <p>Obviously we hope that isn’t for a very long time, as there’s a Premier League title to be won first!</p>
      <p>The Reds face Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon, knowing a win will at least maintain our eight point lead at the top of the table and potentially enhance it depending on what happens with Chelsea, Leicester and Manchester City below us.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola faces Frank Lampard, so we know at least one of the chasing pack will drop points.</p>
