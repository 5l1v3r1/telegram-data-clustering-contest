      <h1>TSB bank problems: Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis responds to payment delays</h1>
      <h2>"Many customers will be struggling not to think that TSB stands for 'The Screwed Bank"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:11:39+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:11</time> by <a rel="author">Jasper King</a></address>
      <p>Payments into TSB accounts up and down the UK have been delayed overnight, leaving some customers without wages.</p>
      <p>The issues are currently ongoing and have left some customers overdrawn and struggling to buy everyday essential items.</p>
      <p>TSB has apologised to their customers in a tweet, but there is still no sign when customers money will arrive in their bank accounts. They have said however that no customers will be left out of pocket.</p>
      <p>But founder of <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/">Money Saving Expert.com</a> Martin Lewis has hit back at the bank.</p>
      <p>He said: "Many customers will be struggling not to think that TSB stands for 'The Screwed Bank.'</p>
      <p>Yet another major banking failure has left people worried about their wages and how they are going to pay their bills.</p>

        <b>We are providing live updates on <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/tsb-live-online-bank-problems-3565577">this ongoing TSB issue here</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Even if this is fixed quickly, this type of service is simply not good enough.</p>
      <p>"My call to those who are affected by this and angry and disillusioned with their bank is to stop b****ing, start switching.</p>
      <p>"Right now you can get up to Â£175 to switch - and some banks which pay, including HSBC, M&amp;S and First Direct, have better customer service ratings and less of a history of IT problems."</p>
