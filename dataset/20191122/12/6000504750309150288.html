        <b>ABN Amro is discontinuing its Wallet app for Android smartphones as too few customers use the device to make payments.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Dutch bank says that fewer than five percent of its customers have ever used the bank's three-year old Wallet app on Android to make a payment.<br/><br/>The decision to ditch the inhouse wallet comes just a month after ABN Amro rolled out Apple Pay for contactless payments on iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad and Mac.<br/><br/>The Android app will continue to function for two months, before being switched off by the bank.<br/><br/>In January, ABN Amro began offering all of its Dutch customers the chance to link their accounts to a host of Android-compatible wearable contactless payments devices, including fitness bands, watches, keyrings and jewellery.</p>
