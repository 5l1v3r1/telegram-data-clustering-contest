      <p>TOKYO — Pope Francis will fulfil his dream to be a missionary in Japan when he arrives for a three-day visit with two main aims: to appeal for nuclear disarmament and minister to a tiny Catholic flock with a rich but bloody history.</p>
      <p>Francis travels Saturday from Thailand to another Asian country where Catholics are a minority — less than 0.5% of Japan’s 127 million people, most of them loosely affiliated with Buddhism or Shinto, or both.</p>
      <p>The community he will find has changed dramatically with an influx of foreign workers, who make up more than half of Japan’s Catholic population of 440,000.</p>
      <p>Francis will minister to them, including in Nagasaki, which remains a centre of Catholicism centuries after St. Francis Xavier first brought Christianity to the archipelago in 1549.</p>
