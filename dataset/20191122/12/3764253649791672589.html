        <b>Ramon Azeez, <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/695-super-eagles.html">Super Eagles</a> and Granada midfielder, has explained how he was threatened by Barcelona fans in Nigeria after scoring against the Spanish champions in September this year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Barcelona have lost three games this season in the Spanish La Liga, and one of those came from Ramon Azeez's club Granada.</p>
      <p>The Super Eagles midfielder <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1260767-granada-barcelona-ramon-azeez-nets-barca-suffer-surprise-defeat.html">scored the first goal for Granada against Barcelona</a> in his side's shocking 2-0 win over Valverde and his wards.</p>
      <p>Many Nigerian football lovers were happy and congratulated the former youth international for scoring against Barcelona, but some were livid with him.</p>

        <i>“I got a lot of messages that night. Some people insulted me that they lost their bet due to Barca’s defeat, while some called to congratulate me.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“Some people even sent me messages on social media that I shouldn’t come to Lagos that if they catch me, they will deal with me. So, I told them that it was nothing that I just have to do my job and protect it as well,''</i> Ramon Azeez explained.</p>
      <p>Ramon Azeez recently made a return to the Super Eagles and played against Brazil in an international friendly and also against Lesotho in AFCON 2021 qualifier.</p>
