      <h1>Jose Mourinho makes feelings clear on starring role in Tottenham's Amazon documentary</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho replaced Mauricio Pochettino as Tottenham boss earlier this week and must now be filmed for the fly-on-the-wall Amazon documentary</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Lewis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-lewis/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho's</a> bid to turn <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> into superpowers will be captured by Amazon Prime’s cameras this season.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old Portuguese has given the green light to being filmed for the fly-on-the-wall documentary as part of his dramatic return to English football.</p>
      <p>It means the filmmakers have lucked out following the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino and Mourinho’s dramatic third return to English football.</p>
      <p>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy controversially agreed a £10million deal to allow behind-the-scenes access this season for the documentary due to be screened next year.</p>

      <p>Mourinho revealed he was on board after being asked whether he was happy with his participation during Thursday’s media briefings for the written press.</p>
      <p>His silent response, however, spoke a thousand words. Putting his finger to his lips, he opened up the pocket to his tracksuit trousers to reveal a small microphone pack before tucking it back away again, saying nothing.</p>
      <p>Levy signed off the deal believing the current season would be one during which Spurs would build on their run to the Champions League Final and yet another top four finish.</p>
      <p>Instead the campaign has seen the departure of the most popular and influential manager the club has had in the modern era.</p>
      <p>Mourinho, who has a history of abrasive dressing room relationships over the years, is believed to be open-minded to the documentary but has made clear that he will determine when cameras are allowed into his office.</p>
      <p>During his time as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss, Mourinho criticised <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a>’s similar deal with the on-demand streaming service.</p>
      <p>"You can be a rich club and buy all the best players in the world but you cannot buy class."</p>
      <p>Mourinho takes charge of Spurs for the first time on Saturday, when he leads them out against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> in a London derby.</p>
      <p>Spurs currently sit 14th in the Premier League table, having won just three times in 12 games so far.</p>
      <p>They already sit 11 points off the top four, and haven't won away from home in the league since January.</p>
