      <p>According to the reports, itâ€™s been about a week since Kodak Black got a 46-month sentence for felony firearm possession. It was also reported that the man also had some plans for self-improvement while behind bars, his real focus is getting his sentence appealed.</p>
      <p>The Shade Room cited the info from Complex and revealed that â€˜in between entering a rehab program and seeking to obtain his college degree, Kodak Black has also been busy with other things while heâ€™s been in prisonâ€”and that includes filing an appeal. Reportedly, earlier this week Kodakâ€™s attorneys filed a notice of appeal for his federal case that ended in him being sentenced to 46 months.â€™</p>
      <p>It seems that more than that, one of the lawyers has also ordered a transcript of the November 13th sentencing hearing.</p>
