        <b>SCOTLAND will come up against a formidable record if they meet Norway in the Euro 2020 play-off final...they haven't lost a game at their Oslo fortress for over three years and 15 games.</b>

      <p>Steve Clarke's side could face the Scandinavian nation if the Scots defeat Israel and Norway overcome Serbia in the other semi-final.</p>

      <p>But Scotland would have to beat a Norway side who have proved to be unbeatable at home recently.</p>
      <p>Their last defeat at the Ullevaal Stadion came in September 2016 and that was against Germany in a World Cup 2018 qualifier where they crashed to a 3-0 loss.</p>
      <p>But since then, Lars Lagerback's side have been impossible to crack in their own backyard.</p>
      <p>They've defeated San Marino, Azerbaijan, Northern Ireland, Australia, Panama, Cyprus, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Malta and the Faroe Islands.</p>
      <p>And they've also drawn with Czech Republic, Sweden twice, Romania and Spain.</p>
      <p>Although, as <i>SunSport</i> revealed yesterday, <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4978855/euro-2020-scotland-england-france-portugal-group-of-death/">Scotland face a nightmare group of death if they make the tournament proper</a>.</p>
      <p>The Dark Blues could come up against England, France AND Portugal in the early stages of the major finals.</p>
