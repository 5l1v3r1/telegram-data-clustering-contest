        <b>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has hired former Aberdeen midfielder Lee Richardson as the Anfield club try to win their first league title in 30 years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Richardson – who played for the Dons in the early 90s and scored a memorable long-range effort in a European Cup Winners’ Cup tie against Torino in 1993 – is now a sports psychologist.</p>
      <p>Klopp has recruited the 50-year-old to consult with the Liverpool squad, who are eight points clear at the top of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>He has his own office at the club’s Melwood training complex and is based there three days a week.</p>
      <p>Richardson, who turned out for Halifax, Watford, Blackburn Rovers, Oldham, Stockport, Huddersfield, Bury, Livingston and Chesterfield in a 17-year career, has also worked with Lancashire County Cricket Club and was previously part of the backroom staff at West Ham and Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>He spent two years managing Chesterfield between 2007 and 2009 after hanging up his boots.</p>
      <p>Scottish football fans will most likely remember him as part of the Aberdeen squad that finished second behind Rangers in all three domestic competitions in the 1992/93 season.</p>
      <p>Richardson netted in the Scottish Cup final, scoring a 77th minute goal as the Dons went down 2-1 to Rangers in a repeat of the Scottish League Cup final, in which he also featured.</p>
