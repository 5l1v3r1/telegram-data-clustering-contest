      <h1>‘Demon slayer’</h1>

      <h3>PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte  has  joked that  he has ordered the search for and killing of the “demon” inventor of electronic cigarettes.</h3>
      <p>“Itong vaping, ewan ko kung sinong demonyo nag-imbento niyan. Pinapahanap ko nga, i-extrajudicial killing ko ‘yang gago na ‘yan.</p>
      <p>(I don’t know the demon who invented vape. I ordered the search for him. I will subject that stupid individual to extrajudicial killing)</p>
      <p>Duterte ordered the ban on e-cigarettes on Tuesday, days after the Department of Health announced the first case of a vape-related lung injury.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Duterte also ordered the police to arrest individuals caught vaping in public.</p>
      <p>The President said he banned vaping to protect the health of Filipinos, particularly the youth. He argued that like cigarettes, vapes contain the highly-addictive chemical nicotine.</p>
      <p>Duterte also explained why he allows the manufacture and importation of tobacco while he banned the importation of e-cigarettes.</p>
      <p>“Why cannot we ban cigarettes? Why? Because we allow its manufacture and maybe the importation of tobacco. We allow it, pinapayagan natin, and then we tax them,” he said.</p>
      <p>According to Duterte, vape products are not regulated by the country’s Food and Drug Administration.</p>
      <p>Nicotine can cause an increase in blood pressure, heart rate, flow of blood to the heart and a narrowing of the arteries (vessels that carry blood). It also contributes to the hardening of the arterial walls, which in turn, may lead to heart ailments.</p>
      <p>The Philippine National Police’s crackdown on vape users drew flak for alleged lack of legal basis as Duterte has yet to issue an executive order to formalize the ban.</p>
      <p>Senate President Vicente Sotto III said a law is needed to ban e-cigarettes.</p>
      <p>Duterte has said that he would soon issue an EO on the matter but noted that police can already arrest those vaping in public on the basis of a law that prohibits the distribution of toxic materials in public.</p>
