      <p>Mamelodi Sundowns have arguably the strongest squad in the Premier Soccer League, however, Siya sources have over the past months, revealed that the Brazilians are still eyeing a number of players who could become new additions.</p>
      <p>The January transfer window is just over a month away, where after the halfway mark in the season, clubs will get the opportunity to reshuffle and strengthen their squads.</p>
      <p>While a number of players at the Brazilians are being linked with an exit, Soccer Laduma takes a look at seven of the players who have been linked with a move to the Chloorkop-based club.</p>
      <p>As reported in this week’s edition of Soccer Laduma, Thabo Nodada is being eyed up by the Brazilians as a possible midfield addition, although Cape Town City are expected to shake off any local interest in the player.</p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Thamsanqa Mkhize and Edmilson Dove are two more players at the Citizens who have also caught Sundowns’ interest, despite their full-back positions of not much concern at the moment.</p>
      <p>Although having Mauricio Affonso, Tokelo Rantie, Jose Ali Meza, Phakamani Mahlambi and Emiliano Tade upfront, the Brazilians have still been monitoring SuperSport United’s, Bradley Grobler, who is one of the top goal-scorers this season. </p>
      <p>George Maluleka has also previously caught the eye of Sundowns and with the player’s contract with Chiefs coming to an end on June 30 next year, it remains to be seen whether the Brazilians could revisit their interest in the player before Chiefs land his signature on a new deal.</p>
      <p>Also at SuperSport, Tebogo Mokoena and Aubrey Modiba have long been on Sundowns’ radar, although Matsatsantsa are yet to budge on local interest in the duo.</p>
