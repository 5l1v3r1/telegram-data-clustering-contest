      <h1>First look inside the festive Après Ski Bar in Bristol city centre</h1>
      <h2>The pop up attraction also includes a roller disco and street food, with more to come</h2>

      <p>Bristol has become very festive in recent weeks, with the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/bristol-christmas-market-prices-broadmead-3517322">German market launching in Broadmead</a> and Christmas lights going up all over the city.</p>
      <p>In addition, the Après Ski Bar has opened in Millennium Square, as part of multi-use attraction The Square.</p>
      <p>Back for its fourth year, the Christmas pop up also features a roller disco run by BUMP and numerous street food vendors, with more to come including screenings on We The Curious' big screen and an immersive light installation.</p>
      <p>The roller disco is a replacement for the ice rink which has <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/ice-rink-bristol-millennium-square-3455386">not gone ahead this year for environmental reasons</a>.</p>
      <p>

      <p>Visitors can choose from warming beverages such as mulled cider and wine, a selection of craft ales or cocktails, including a blood orange negroni and rhubarb ginger collins, which can all be enjoyed while wrapped in blankets supplied by the venue.</p>
      <p>Food on offer includes Pepe Nero, who are serving mouth-watering pizzas including vegan and gluten-free options and kitchen takeover kings Le Boeuf &amp; Lobster, who are rustling up indulgent mac &amp; cheese, burgers and more.</p>
      <p>Jon Ojo, Operations Manager of Pure Spaces, the team behind the attraction, said: "We are delighted to be working with We The Curious again to create Winter at the Square.</p>
      <p>"After the success of the Bristol Beach Club and last year's Apres Bar, we're coming back bigger and better for the people of Bristol over the festive period.</p>
      <p>"Our good friends Bump Roller Disco are back on the square to offer a more sustainable alternative to the ice rink of previous years and we have lots of great surprises in store!"</p>
      <p>The Square will run through until January 5.</p>

      <p>New for 2019, the free immersive and interactive art installation, Submergence by Squidsoup, will be joining the Apres Ski Bar, taking centre stage in Millennium Square on December 12.</p>
      <p>The piece uses thousands of individual points of suspended light to create feelings of presence and movement within a physical space.</p>
      <p>Designers say the work combines sound, light, physical space and virtual worlds to produce alluring and emotive headspaces.</p>
      <p>On November 30, Big Screen Bristol will host a free screening of Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone.</p>
      <p>The event will be a fancy dress led event and the best dressed will receive a bar tab for the night.</p>
