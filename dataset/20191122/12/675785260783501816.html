      <h2>A new price war has broken out between Britain's supermarkets with 2p a litre cuts to the price of petrol and diesel now brought in by two major players</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:06:33+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:06</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>Asda has cut its petrol and diesel prices 2p a litre, to their lowest prices since April.</p>
      <p>The cut means drivers will pay no more than £1.20 a litre for petrol or £1.24 a litre for diesel at Asda's 322 filling stations.</p>
      <p>Asda senior fuel buyer Dave Tyrer said: "With Christmas just around the corner, we're pleased to be able lower the cost of fuel and pass these savings on to our customers."</p>
      <p>Not to be out-done Sainsbury's then announced that it, too, would be knocking 2p a litre from diesel and petrol across its 314 forecourts from Saturday.</p>
      <p>The supermarket then added customers can also collect Nectar points every time they fill up - one point on every litre purchased.</p>

      <p>Sainsbury’s fuel buyer Matthew Doherty said: “We know Christmas is a really important time for customers and in the busy festive period we are committed to helping them live well for less, whether they’re stocking up on groceries or refuelling their cars.</p>
      <p>"That’s why we’re dropping the price of diesel and unleaded petrol by up to 2 pence per litre across every single one of our forecourts from Sunday. Whether in store or at the pumps, customers know they will get fantastic value with Sainsbury’s”.</p>
      <p>In the past, cuts by Asda and Sainsbury's are nearly always followed by Morrisons with Tesco joining in as well more often than not.</p>
      <p>Tesco is also currently offering drivers 10p a litre off when they spend £60 on groceries until December 1.</p>
      <p>If you shop in-store, your receipt will automatically include a money-off fuel coupon when you spend £60.</p>
      <p>Those who shop online will instead get a money-off fuel coupon when their shopping is delivered, or when they collect their items in store.</p>
