      <p>Insiders offered a possible explanation for the rapper's need to see a physician.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> French Montana is preparing to drop his <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/french-montana-presents-montana-album-trailer-cover-art-gwIGJ5tTB0SRUdGJmFPeNQ/"><i>Montana</i> album</a> in the near future. However, the Moroccan-American music artist is also supposedly recovering from a health situation at the moment.</p>
      <p>According to <i><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/21/french-montana-hospitalized-heart-rate-elevated-stomach-pain/">TMZ</a></i>, Montana was hospitalized in Los Angeles on Thursday after suffering from stomach pains, intense nausea, and an elevated heart rate. Law enforcement officials apparently called in the emergency following L.A. County Sheriff's deputies arriving at Montana's Calabasas home for a potential robbery. </p>
      <p>The 35-year-old "Writing On The Wall" rhymer was said to be awake, alert, and receiving IV fluid treatment while in the medical facility. Sources suggested Montana may have been exposed to contaminated food while traveling overseas in Europe and the Middle East.</p>
      <p>On Thursday afternoon, French Montana's Instagram account posted a clip of himself with comedian/actor Shawn Wayans from <i>Billboard</i>'s Quizzed"<i> </i>YouTube video. As of press time, he has not publicly addressed the reports of his hospitalization.</p>
