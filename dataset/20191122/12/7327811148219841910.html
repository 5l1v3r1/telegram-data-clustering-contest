      <p>Boxing legend Floyd Mayweather posted to Instagram that he's "coming out of retirement in 2020."</p>
      <p>This comes after the 42-year-old posted that he's partnering with Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) president Dana White for "another spectacular event" but did not specify details.</p>
      <p>Mayweather, who has won all 50 of his fights, is considered one of the greatest boxers of all time.</p>

      <p>He announced his retirement in 2015 but has returned to the ring for special occasions.</p>
      <p>In 2017, he defeated Conor McGregor in the UFC star's first-ever professional boxing match and reportedly made more than $200 million for that fight.</p>
      <p>He was last seen fighting at an exhibition boxing match against Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa, who was defeated in just 140 seconds, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/22/sport/floyd-mayweather-comeback-dana-white-spt-intl/index.html">according to CNN</a>.</p>
