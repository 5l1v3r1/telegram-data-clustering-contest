      <h1>Report: Resident Evil 3 remake in production</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:27:19+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:27</time> by <a rel="author">Tuffcub</a></address>
      <p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksBrLDX8SCM">SpawnWave</a> has reported on a rumour the somewhat obvious news that a remake of Resident Evil 3 is currently in development and will be released next year. While we wouldn’t usually report on such things Eurogamer say they have also heard of the project. I too may have heard something as well but couldn’t possible comment<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_4">.</a></p>
      <p>Capcom have said they are open to the possibility of more remakes following the huge success of Resident Evil 2. They are currently working on the spin off game Project Resistance and recently released a video showing a full match, splitting the screen four ways so you can see the three survivors teaming up while the Mastermind sets traps.We also get to see the Mastermind taking control of some of the zombies and directly attacking the other players.</p>

      <p>Project Resistance is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam, and looks to be enhanced for the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X.  Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil 6 both launched on  Nintendo Switch on October 29th</p>
      <p>The remake of Resident Evil 2 has been a huge hit, topping the charts across the world and selling 3 million units in the first week alone.</p>
      <p>“This Resident Evil 2 remake is a phenomenal update of a classic game,” said Steve<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/22/resident-evil-2-review/"> in our 9/10 review</a>. “It combines the best of the original’s narrative and puzzles with the ammo crafting of Resident Evil 3 and the action gameplay of Resident Evil 4 to create a hybrid that still manages to feel like classic Resi. Old fans will enjoy the nostalgic retread of Racoon City in all its newfound glory, whilst newcomers will get to experience one of the finest episodes of the series as it should be. The remake has been more than worth the wait, and the evil of the Umbrella Corporation is back in residence at the top of the survival horror pile once more.”</p>
