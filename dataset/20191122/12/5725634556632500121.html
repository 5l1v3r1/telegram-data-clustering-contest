The futuristic, trapezoid-shaped vehicle will start at a competitive $39,900 - with 7,500 pounds of towing capacity and 250 miles of range per charge. Dual motor ($49.9K) and tri-motor models ($69.9K) extend towing capacity to 10K and 14K pounds, as well as a 300 and 500 mile range. Expected to arrive in late 2021 and 2022, the pickups also feature a cargo bed that can hold and charge an electric ATV (Tesla didn't provide details).<br/><b>Go deeper:</b> <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3521440-tesla-cybertruck-starts-39900">Cybertruck out-pulled a Ford F-150, while a shatterproof window demonstration went awry.</a></p>

In 2017, Transport for London concluded that Uber wasn't "fit and proper" to hold a license, saying the ride-hailing company failed to do adequate driver background checks and report serious criminal offenses. It also took issue with a software called Greyball that blocked government officials attempting to catch lawbreaking drivers.<br/><b>Go deeper:</b> <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4307430-ubers-many-problems-invested-company">Crispus Nyaga invests in Uber despite many problems.</a></p>

The troubled office-sharing company will hold an all-hands meeting at 10 a.m. ET today to address the changes slated to come.

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Almost three weeks into the job, ECB President Christine Lagarde is calling for regional governments to invest more in a "new European policy mix." Monetary policy should not be "the only game in town," she added, stating the central bank will undertake a "strategic review" in the near future. Uncertainties impacting eurozone growth have also "proven to be more persistent than expected," and increasing trade seen during decades of globalization is "no longer an absolute certainty."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Following three days of slight losses, U.S. stock index futures are edging up 0.2%, hoping to break out of the recent trend amid whipsawing expectations over reaching Phase One of a trade deal. China's President Xi said overnight he wants to resolve core concerns - but is not afraid to "fight back" - while the <i>WSJ</i> reported that Beijing extended an invite to U.S. officials for a new round of face-to-face talks. Mixed PMI readings out of Europe further suggested the continent's slowdown may have stabilized, though it's unlikely to pick up significantly in the near-term.</p>

      </p>
      <p>With little time to spare before a midnight deadline, President Trump signed a short-term spending bill into law, funding the government through Dec. 20. That gives lawmakers more time to strike a long-term appropriations deal. Congress already passed a two-year agreement to set budget levels and suspend the U.S. debt ceiling, but lawmakers still need to approve where and how the money gets spent.</p>

      <p>House Democrats and the Trump administration failed to reach an agreement on USMCA trade deal during a meeting on Thursday. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal said the two sides made progress, however, and it's possible Congress could vote on the agreement by the end of the year.

Clifford Law Offices, which represents families of victims from the second Ethiopian Air crash, said 103 lawsuits have been filed against Boeing (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA">BA</a>) so far, with 30 more cases expected to be filed soon.</p>
