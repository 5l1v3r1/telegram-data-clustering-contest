      <p>Bangla Tigers have played some quality cricket in this tournament and the three all-rounders David Wiese, Thisara Perera and Robbie Frylinck have been instrumental in the team's success. While the Tigers are reliant on their multi-skilled players, the Maratha Arabians rely a lot on their batsmen.</p>

      <p>With the presence of Chris Lynn, Yuvraj Singh, Adam Lyth and Hazratullah Zazai in their batting line-up, the Arabians have trounced almost every opposition in this tournament.</p>
      <p>Though the Bangla Tigers have been phenomenal in this tourney, the Arabians will start as the favorites to win this match because of their in-form batting unit which has been backed by the fast bowling duo of Lasith Malinga and Mitchell McClenaghan.</p>
