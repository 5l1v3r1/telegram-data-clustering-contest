      <h1>Defiant Rachel Riley hits back after calls for her to be sacked from Countdown</h1>
      <h2>Pregnant Rachel Riley came under fire for sharing a doctored photo of Jeremy Corbyn being arrested, and faced calls to be removed as Countdown presenter</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:25:30+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:25</time> by <a rel="author">Emmeline Saunders</a></address>
      <p>Rachel Riley has sent a defiant message after coming under fire yesterday for her message about <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> .</p>
      <p>The heavily pregnant TV star faced calls to be sacked from Countdown after tweeting an image of herself wearing a t-shirt with a doctored image of the Labour leader being arrested at an anti-racism protest.</p>
      <p>The historic photograph originally shows Mr Corbyn being led away by two police officers while protesting against apartheid outside South Africa House in London in 1984.</p>
      <p>But his placard - which originally stated "Defend the right to protest against apartheid. Join this picket" - had been Photoshopped on Rachel's top to bear the words: "Jeremy Corbyn is a racist endeavour."</p>

      <p>Her image sent <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> into meltdown, with calls for her to be fired from the Channel 4 show.</p>
      <p>But defiant Rachel has since tweeted to thank her supporters for their messages, saying: "Thanks for all the lovely messages of support, &amp; all the silent supporters who've followed me, means a lot.</p>
      <p>"Shows how counterproductive nasty pile-ons actually are," she went on.</p>
      <p>"I made this promise I intend to keep it. If this is the price to raise awareness then sobeit. Lots of love."</p>
      <p>The tweet she signposted to was published on October 29 and read: "As we edge towards a December <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> , a heartfelt promise: I will do everything in my power to try to ensure my baby, Jewish by blood, will not be born under an antisemitic government. I hope this will never happen, please use your vote wisely."</p>

      <p>It comes as the increasingly toxic election campaign goes into overdrive, with the Conservative party <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tories-release-another-misleading-video-20928508">accused of tweeting out a 'fake' video</a> of Labour candidate Jess Phillips talking about her party's manifesto on Good Morning Britain.</p>
      <p>The Tories sent out the short clip yesterday morning, but doctored the kicker to remove the original date of Jess's interview - October 3 - and added "Labour manifesto to launch" to make it look like she was on the ITV show yesterday morning.</p>
      <p>They captioned the clip: "MUST WATCH: Labour's Jess Phillips undermines Corbyn's manifesto by admitting they can't or won't deliver on their promises. With no clear plan for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> , Labour just can't deliver."</p>

      <p>A slogan on the video reads: "Labour: Not sure we can deliver on our promises".</p>
      <p>Ms Phillips condemned the video, telling the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-conservative-tory-video-labour-mp-jess-phillips-a9212081.html">Independent:</a> "It is totally misleading to share it in this context, but I can’t say I’m shocked because <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> and his party have shown themselves to be serial liars.</p>
      <p>"I realise they wouldn't recognise a politician speaking honestly, so it must be difficult for them.</p>
      <p>"Nothing that was in the Tory manifesto has been delivered, so they really don't have a leg to stand on anyway."</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has contacted Channel 4 for comment.</p>
