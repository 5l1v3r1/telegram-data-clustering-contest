      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</a> team owner Robert Kraft blasted <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> in a meeting at the height of the national anthem kneeling controversy in October 2017, uncovered audio revealed.</p>
      <p>Kraft, who is a longtime friend of Trump’s, took a stand against the president’s rhetoric against players who were kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice in the U.S., according to audio obtained by <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/22/robert-kraft-nfl-donald-trump-kneelers-new-audio/">TMZ Sports</a> on Friday.</p>

      <p>“I must tell you, I think these dialogues are great,” Kraft said. “But, the elephant in the room now in my opinion, is this kneeling, which every player has a right to do if they feel it's right.</p>
      <p>“The problem we have is, we have a president that will use that as fodder to do his mission that I don’t feel is in the best interest of the matter. It's divisive and it's horrible. And, it’s actually the opposite of what you all are trying to do.”</p>

      <p>Kraft apparently said that no matter what the players did, about half of the country will side with Trump anyway.</p>

      <p>“I just hope one of the things that can come out of here is that we find a way to be unified. And, be able to carry through and follow through,” he said.</p>
      <p>The meeting at which Kraft was heard speaking in took place in New York City during the middle of the 2017 season. According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/sports/nfl-owners-kaepernick.html">New York Times</a>, about 30 people were at the meeting that included owners, players and league executives. Commissioner Roger Goodell reportedly had even made a point to say “let’s make sure that we keep this confidential.”</p>
