        <b>On Friday, Real Madrid’s Mariano Diaz appeared to troll his teammate and star forward Gareth Bale for his love of golf, after the latter failed to execute a proper pass during the team’s training session.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Watch the video below, to see what happened:</p>

      <p>During the second half of the video, one can easily spot Mariano gesturing a golf shot at Gareth Bale, apparently asking him to “dig passes out like golf shots,” according to <i>AFP</i>‘s football reporter Tom Allnutt. And the Welshman seems to respond in jest, laughing and attempting to shove Mariano away in a fun manner.</p>
      <p>Tom Allnut further said that Bale was furious about Mariano’s gesture, but a close-up shot seems to suggest that he was having fun:</p>

      <p>A couple of days ago, the 30-year-old was reported to have aimed a sly dig at Real Madrid, while after celebrating Wales’ qualification to the UEFA Euro Cup 2020.</p>
      <p>Bale celebrated with the now-famous “Wales, Golf, Madrid – In that order” flag, after the Dragons defeated Hungary 2-0 to seal their qualification to Europe’s top international football competition.</p>
      <p>And last week, he himself had admitted that he is more excited to play for his country than Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>“With Wales, I’m speaking my own language and feeling more comfortable,” he said, before adding:</p>
      <p>“I definitely have a bit more excitement playing for Wales. I’ve been with most of the players, especially the older ones, since we were in the Under-17s. It’s like playing with your mates down the park on a Sunday.”</p>
      <p>“But it still doesn’t change what I give on the pitch. I always give 100% wherever I am, and that’s what I always strive to do,” Bale concluded.</p>
