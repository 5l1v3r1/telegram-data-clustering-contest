      <p>Deontay Wilder is desperate for Andy Ruiz Jr to beat Anthony Joshua so he can unify the heavyweight division in 2020.</p>
      <p>Joshua is targeting revenge over Ruiz Jr in their rematch next month, but Wilder is convinced a win for AJ will derail any plans for a heavyweight unification showdown.</p>
      <p>Wilder has repeatedly claimed Joshua has no intention of ever fighting him and is backing Ruiz Jr to do him a favour on 7 December.</p>
      <p>‘Andy knows what he needs to do,’ Wilder told IFL TV.</p>

      <p>‘He doesn’t need to change anything but go in there and do what he did the first time.</p>

      <p>‘I’m looking forward to him defeating AJ and winning a second time. He has all the momentum and courage. He knows what to do and I think he’s going to be victorious.</p>
      <p>‘It would be great for boxing if he wins because then we can finally have a unification bout. One champion, one face, one name.</p>
      <p>‘That’s not the case if AJ wins, he’s already stated that he has no interest in fighting me no more.</p>

      <p>‘In the heavyweight division it’s all about unifying the division. When you have two fighters who are in agreement about that then you have no choice but to go for that fighter and you want that fighter to win. There should just be one champion in this division…so go Ruiz!’</p>
      <p>While Wilder has one eye on the fight between Joshua and Ruiz, the Bronze Bomber has his own rematch to contend with this weekend in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>The WBC champion defends his title against Luis Ortiz, but has faced criticism from Tyson Fury over the timing of the fight.</p>
      <p>Fury is scheduled to clash with Wilder again on 22 February and is worried his rival will pull out due to injury or fatigue.</p>
      <p>‘I’ll be ready – make sure you’re ready February 22 and make sure that cut has healed because I’m coming for it,’ Wilder said in response to Fury’s latest comments.</p>
