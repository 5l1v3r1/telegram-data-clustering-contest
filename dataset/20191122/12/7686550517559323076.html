      <p>With an unrelenting fixture schedule, December is often a critical month in the football season.</p>
      <p>Across the course of the month there will be a total of 40 live Premier League games on Sky, BT and new players in the TV game, Amazon.</p>
      <p>Among the highlights on Sky Sports is the Manchester Derby on December 7th, Man City's trips to Arsenal and home tie against high-flying Leicester and Jose Mourinho's first game as Tottenham boss against his old club Chelsea.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=11005&amp;clickref=Regionals-Sky&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.sky.com%252Fshop%252Ftv%252Fsports%252F%5D%5D">50% off deal</a> reduces the prices from £30 a month to £15 a month for customers who already have Sky Entertainment.</p>
      <p>Other deals include a saving of £24.50 a month on an all-inclusive Entertainment, Sports and Cinema package that discounts the monthly cost from £67 a month to £42.50 a month.</p>
      <p>As ever, football fans also have the option of watching Sky Sports games without being tied down to any fixed-term monthly contracts with use of Now TV.</p>
      <p>Now TV - which can be viewed online and through most smart TV's, phones and games consoles - allows you to pick up and drop Sky Sports on a Monthly, Weekly or even Daily Basis.</p>
