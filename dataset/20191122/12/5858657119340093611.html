      <p>MINNEAPOLIS — Transportation Security Administration officials have decided to reopen a Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport checkpoint it closed earlier this week claiming it was underused.</p>
      <p>The move to close the checkpoint linked to the Intercontinental Hotel riled airport officials who feared longer passenger wait times as holiday travel approached. The closure came just a year after airport operators spent $24 million to build a connecting walkway from the hotel to the entry point.</p>
      <p>The Metropolitan Airports Commission met with TSA Administrator David Pekoske on Thursday and agreed to reimburse the agency for related costs. The agreement will be reviewed within 12 to 18 months to determine whether traffic has increased enough for the TSA to again pick up the screening costs.</p>
      <p>The checkpoint will open from 4:45 a.m. to 10 a.m. daily.</p>
