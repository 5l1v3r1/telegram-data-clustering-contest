      <p>Management of indigenous oil firm and operator of the Ubima Marginal Field in Rivers State, All Grace Energy Limited, have assured that the company’s operation would benefit its host communities and all other stakeholders in the area.</p>
      <p>The company gave the assurance at the flag-off of production from the oil field, located in OML 17 in Ikwerre local government area of Rivers state.</p>
      <p>In a statement made available to The Nation in Port Harcourt, Rivers state, the company stated that Early Well Test (EWT) commenced last Thursday, following approval from the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR).</p>
      <p>It expressed joy at the landmark achievement, and promised that the company would strive to achieve “the work program approved by the Joint Operation Committee (JOC) of the Joint Venture partners.”</p>
      <p>“More wells will be drilled and more efficient evacuation system will be put in place in the coming year,” the statement stated.</p>
      <p>The Chief Executive Officer assured that all stakeholders, including its host Ubima Community, River State and Nigeria would benefit from the re-opening and restart of production from the marginal field.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Leslie Ikem, HSE personnel, explained that AGEL was a joint venture with Wester-Ord (technical partners), explaining that the facility was drilled in 1964 but re-entry activities commenced in 2014.</p>
      <p>“But today (Friday) the well was opened and now the oil is flowing. This is an achievement for the JV partners.”</p>

      <p>The Project Engineer, Mr. Abiodun Demilade Awoponle, confirmed that first oil had been achieved from the well, but explained that due to limited storage capacity in Ubima, the company would be trucking crude to the nearby Otakikpo Marginal Field facility for export.</p>
      <p>“First oil has been achieved; basically there is limited storage on the Ubima miginal field so we are going to be trucking to (Otakikpo Marginal) Andoni LGA, operated by our sister field Green Energy.”</p>
      <p>“After trucking there storage and exportation will be done from there. It is a very big milestone and production per day is about 1,000barels and from there progress will continue. We have the drive, the personnel and (are) willing and able people to push it forward making Nigeria economy and market better.</p>
      <p>Nsika Umoren, who gave the orientation speech on the facility and HSE procedure on site, disclosed that the guiding principles on the facility is tagged ‘100’, which translates to One (1) family, zero (0) harm to people and zero (0) leaks to the environment).</p>
