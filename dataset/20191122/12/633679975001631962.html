      <p>Ten people charged in connection with a R600m toilet tender scam in the Eastern Cape were granted bail ranging from R10 000 to R40 000 in the East London Magistrate's Court on Friday.</p>
      <p>They were arrested in four provinces by the Hawks on Thursday on charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering.</p>
      <p>Among those arrested were former Amathole District Municipality Municipal Manager, Chris Magwaqana, ADM chief financial officer, Nkosinathi Soga, and the bosses of the Siyenza Group, which was awarded the toilet tender, Bongani Mpaluza, and Vuyani Gaga.</p>
      <p>In an earlier statement, the Hawks said that the arrests were made during intelligence-driven operations in the Eastern Cape, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and Kwazulu Natal by a multi-disciplinary team early on Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson, Colonel Katlego Mogale, said the operation was the culmination of an investigation into a complaint from National Treasury that the suspects had allegedly colluded to flout procurement processes to obtain a massive tender from the Amathole District Municipality for the provision of toilets in the Eastern Cape.</p>
      <p>"The Hawksâ€™ preliminary investigation discovered that over R600 million was to be awarded for the contract, of which R286 million had already be paid to the suspects," Mogale said.</p>
      <p>She said the outstanding collaboration with the office of the Director Public Prosecutions in the Eastern Cape made it possible for the case to proceed.</p>
      <p>Magistrate Annamarrie Elliot postponed the matter to 5 February 2020.</p>
