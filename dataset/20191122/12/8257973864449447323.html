      <p>Nov. 22 (UPI) -- British police said Friday authorities have arrested a 23-year-old Northern Ireland man in connection with the deaths of 39 Vietnamese nationals who were found dead in a truck in Essex last month.</p>
      <p>Essex Police <a href="https://www.essex.police.uk/news/essex/news/news/2019/october/murder-investigation-launched-after-39-people-found-dead-in-lorry-container/">said Friday</a> the unidentified man was arrested on suspicion of human trafficking and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Immigration_Reform/?tps=1">immigration</a> charges. He is one of several suspects from Northern Ireland who have been apprehended in the case. He was detained in Beaconsfield by Thames Valley Police, officials said.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/10/26/Trailer-driver-charged-with-manslaughter-in-39-deaths/7791572112659/">Oct. 23</a> discovery at the Waterglade Industrial Park sparked a large-scale investigation and increased attention to human trafficking in Britain.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors have charged the driver of the truck, Northern Ireland citizen Maurice Robinson, with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy and money laundering. He is scheduled to make his <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/essex-lorry-deaths-man-arrested-in-northern-ireland-over-39-dead-vietnamese-nationals-11867010">next court appearance</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>Police previously arrested Eamonn Harrison, also from Northern Ireland, and he is awaiting extradition in Dublin.</p>
      <p>Authorities have also arrested a 38-year-old man, 46-year-old man and 38-year-old woman in connection with the case. They have all been released on bail.</p>
      <p>Police said they're looking for two others -- brothers Ronan and Christopher Hughes, from County Armagh in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>Vietnamese authorities said they have also made several arrests in the case.</p>
      <p>The 39 dead were initially believed to be Chinese, but the 31 men and eight women were later determined to have come from Vietnam.</p>
