      <p>Earlier today, Huawei announced that it will hold a new product launch conference in Shanghai on November 25. And at this event, the manufacturer will release the Huawei MatePad tablet and Sound X audio product. However, it turns out there will be another product as well, the new Huawei MateBook D.</p>

      <p>The original Huawei MateBook D is an entry-level notebook product. Although the mold has not been replaced, there are hardware updates done <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2017/12/25/huawei-matebook-d-latest-intel-core-processors-announced/">almost every year</a>. But so far, Huawei has not updated any product to the 10th generation Core processor. We mean there is every reason to think the new MateBook D will use the latest processor of Intel.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it’s quite possible that this MateBook D will a full-screen design like the previously exposed MateBook 15. But the screen ratio will still be 16:9. This notebook should also come with a rich interface set. There will be three USB Type-A ports and one Type-C port, and a full-size HDMI interface.</p>
      <p>Apart from this, we learned about interesting news as well. One of the bloggers revealed that Huawei will launch a gaming laptop next year. This product will sport the latest Super series graphics cards from NVIDIA.</p>
      <p>If you are not aware, Intel will launch the 10 generations Core mobile standard-voltage processor in 2020. The i5 will be upgraded to 6 cores and 12 threads, while the i7 will be upgraded to 8 cores and 16 threads. In addition, Nvidia will also launch the Super version of the Mobile GTX graphics card next year. So there is every reason to think Huawei’s gaming laptop will sport both.</p>
