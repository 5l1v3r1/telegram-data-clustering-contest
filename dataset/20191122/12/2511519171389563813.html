      <h1>Liverpool: Joe Gomez ‘better than good’ after Raheem Sterling row, claims Jurgen Klopp</h1>
      <h2>Gomez and Sterling clashed while on international duty with England </h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool</a> manager <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Jurgen_Klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> says <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/joe-gomez">Joe Gomez</a> is “better than good” after his altercation with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Raheem_Sterling">Raheem Sterling</a> earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Manchester City forward Sterling initially clashed with Reds defender Gomez towards the end of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/PremierLeague">Premier League</a> match between the sides on November 10 at Anfield.</p>
      <p>The pair were then involved in a fracas the following day on England duty after meeting up at St George’s Park, with Sterling later apologising at a team meeting and on social media.</p>
      <p>Sterling subsequently sat out England’s <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Euro_2020">Euro 2020</a> qualifier against Montenegro as punishment but returned to the starting line-up in the 4-0 victory over Kosovo on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Klopp insists Gomez, who was left with a scratch on his face following the clash, has not been affected by the incident and the German has no issues with how the situation was handled.</p>
      <p>“He is good, better than good,” said Klopp. “The people involved were fine pretty quick. Things like this happen in football. Absolutely nothing to say about it.</p>
      <p>“The FA dealt with it how they saw right and I cannot judge that as I was not aware of the circumstances.”</p>
