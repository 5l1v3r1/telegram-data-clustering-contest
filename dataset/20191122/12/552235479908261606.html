      <h2>Auchterarder-based couple's bingo nights for local causes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:46:31+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:46</time> by <a rel="author">Robbie Chalmers</a></address>
      <p>A Perthshire couple have started up charity evenings to support local causes after being inspired by a cancer fundraiser during their retirement in Cyprus.</p>
      <p>Auchterarder-based Margaret and Greg Keenan returned to the town from the Mediterranean last December and have now set up bingo nights every second Tuesday in the Glendevon Hotel to raise funds for local enterprises, such as residential homes.</p>
      <p>The Keenans held their first bingo night five weeks ago with their most recent being held on November 19 in aid of Glencairn House assisted living facility.</p>
      <p>The couple are former owners of Perth-based Taybank Taverns and Taybank Group Ltd, running almost 20 pubs and small hotels in Perth, Dundee and Angus, including the former Thistle Tavern and the Robert Burns Lounge in the Fair City.</p>
      <p>However, after selling up to Belhaven in 2004, they headed out to Cyprus where they befriended local fundraiser Mike Alahan, who supported a local cancer charity.</p>
      <p>Husband Greg said: “We sold out to Belhaven and went to live in Cyprus where we owned a small hotel for a time.</p>
      <p>“While there Margaret helped out Mike Alahan who ran weekly bingo events for the North Cyprus Cancer Charity Trust.”</p>
      <p>However, Mike sadly passed away in 2014, with Margaret then picking up the mantle.</p>
      <p>“Margaret took it over and expanded it to another couple of venues, also raising money for the British Expat Cemetery Funds and Kyrenia Animal Rescue,” Greg added.</p>
      <p>“She donated fairly large sums on a regular basis to all of the chosen charities and was well known among the locals and expats for her charity work.</p>
      <p>“We returned to Scotland in December and we thought that it would be a good idea to continue the charity work Mike had started.</p>
      <p>“We had lots of spare time being retired and we had all the equipment.</p>
      <p>“Margaret got in touch with one of our ex-employees Claire Murray, who lives in Auchterarder, and together they came up with the idea to support local groups like Brownies, Cubs and residential homes among others. The owner of the Glendevon Hotel in Auchterarder agreed to host the event every second Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“The groups to benefit from the first two bingo nights were Auchterarder Brownies and Rainbows, and Parkdale Residents Comfort Fund.</p>
      <p>“The more money we get, the more the jackpot goes up and the more people will come along. We have around 30 every bingo night at the moment but we would like that to go up to 50.”</p>
      <p>The pair are organising a Christmas draw for two hampers and many other prizes donated by local businesses and residents which will take place before the bingo night on December 17.</p>
      <p>Tickets for the hamper draw are on sale at Nosh, The Niblick and Glendevon Hotel, all in Auchterarder. Any group looking to be included in future bingo events or for more information, call Margaret Keenan on 07934 168713.</p>
