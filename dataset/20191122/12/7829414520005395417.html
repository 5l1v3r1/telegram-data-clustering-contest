      <p>China and the US, as two responsible nations, should work together to build an inclusive and open platform supporting innovation and global economic development, Huai Jinpeng, executive vice president of the China Association for Science and Technology, said at the New Economy Forum held in Beijing on Friday.<br/><br/>The world's science community should call for borderless innovation and limitless exchanges, he said.<br/><br/>"Faced with asymmetrical information and various other problems, we need both scientific governance and technological development. In this regard, all countries should work together, be open and cooperative to increase the fluidity of technologies," Huai said.<br/><br/>"It's believed that technological innovation will boost economic growth as well as the advancement of society," he said, noting that technological innovation is needed to tackle challenges like disease, poverty and environment issues.<br/><br/>Global Times<br/><b>RELATED ARTICLES:</b></p>
