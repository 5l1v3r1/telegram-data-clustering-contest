      <p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-10-30-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-grosses-usd600m-in-opening-weekend">Record-breaking Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a> has been knocked off the top spot after just one week, and currently sits at No. 4.</p>
      <p>FIFA 20 still enjoys a solid position in the charts over a month since launch, ranking at No. 5 while Death Stranding has fallen from an opening week position of No. 2 to No. 6 this week.</p>
