      <p>Last week (November 13) <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/yungblud-teases-release-emotive-new-single-tongue-tied-2567527#ohOqU7Kd6WcBstDo.9">Marshmello shared a new single and music video which featured Yungblud alongside Blackbear. </a></p>
      <p>The skulking, angsty pop song, ‘Tongue Tied’, which carries a message of unity and empowerment in the face of poor mental health, comes with a dystopian video that sees a resistant youth stand up to oppressive forces.</p>
      <p>Actress Joey King from Hulu’s true crime series <i>The Act </i>plays a rebel at the heart of the revolt in the video, with Yungblud, Marshmello and Blackbear portraying themselves as members of the resistance.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/yungblud-grim-new-music-video-die-a-little-2563357#QZlXuSkMGwyhOUZ4.99">Earlier this month Yungblud unveiled a chilling new music video for ‘Die A Little’,</a> his contribution to the soundtrack of the third season of <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/netflix">Netflix</a>’s teen drama <i>13 Reasons Why</i>.</p>
      <p>The clip, according to Yungblud in a press release, is a “call out to take mental health seriously.” It was shot in Bulgaria and directed by Andrew Sandler, who previously worked on the singer’s ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/yungblud-announces-new-ep-unveils-stirring-video-hope-underrated-youth-2551030">Hope For The Underrated Youth’ visual</a>, the lead single from his latest EP of the same name.</p>
      <p>The six-track record is “sharply written and filled with bold, unapologetic political statements”, <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/yungblud-underrated-youth-ep-review"><i>NME’</i>s Hannah Mylrea wrote in a four-star review</a>.</p>
