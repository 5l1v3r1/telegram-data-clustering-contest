      <h1>Jose Mourinho keen to ‘do a Mauricio’ with five-year stay at Tottenham</h1>

        <b>Tottenham gave Jose Mourinho a three-and-a-half-year contract and he would like to stay longer in what he expects to be a final English job.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho knows Tottenham is probably his last major club job in English football and would love to emulate the length of Mauricio Pochettino’s stay in north London.</p>
      <p>Spurs sacked Pochettino after five-and-a-half years at the helm on Tuesday, moving swiftly to secure former Chelsea, Real Madrid and Manchester United boss Mourinho as his replacement.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old has penned terms until the end of the 2022-23 season and spoke glowingly of the squad, facilities and wider project he has inherited in north London when facing the media for the first time in his new role.</p>
      <p>As such, he has designs on staying in charge even longer and matching Pochettino’s longevity.</p>
      <p>“I would love to stay many years,” he said. “When I say many years, I know realistically how football is.</p>
      <p>“If I could do a Mauricio, five-and-a-half years, it would be amazing.”</p>
      <p>A three-time Premier League winner across two spells at Chelsea, Mourinho suggested he has 10 years left in the game when pondering his long-term future.</p>
      <p>That means, if all goes to plan at Spurs, this job will conclude his time in a division with which he will be forever associated.</p>
      <p>Other potential stops sketched out for his final years could be boyhood club Vitoria Setubal back in Portugal and his national team,</p>
      <p>“So, I’m 56, 61 [after five years at Tottenham],” he added.</p>
      <p>“Ten more years – Vitoria Setubal, Portugal. It’s maybe the last [job in England], yeah.”</p>
      <p>The immediate item on the agenda for Mourinho is a trip to face old foe Manuel Pellegrini and a West Ham side enduring a similarly underwhelming campaign to Spurs.</p>
      <p>Tottenham are winless in the Premier League since the end of September, with a return of three draws from their past five matches.</p>
      <p>They lie 14th – two places and a point better off than West Ham, who last won six games ago at home to Mourinho’s old employers from Old Trafford.</p>
