      <h1>Jurgen Klopp gives Joe Gomez update following Raheem Sterling altercation</h1>
      <h2>The Liverpool defender clashed with the Manchester City winger while they were on international duty following the Reds' 3-1 victory over City at Anfield</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:07:24+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:07</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has insisted Joe Gomez has not been affected by the clash with Raheem Sterling which saw the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> man dropped from England's game against Montenegro.</p>
      <p>The pair were involved in an altercation in the team canteen, with Sterling taking issue with Gomez's conduct during Liverpool's 3-1 win over City.</p>
      <p>Gomez appeared to be left with a scratch and he was also booed by some England fans when he came on as a second-half substitute in the 7-0 thrashing of Montenegro.</p>
      <p>Despite his eventful time of it during the international break, Klopp says Gomez is fine, and added that he had no issues with how the FA dealt with the incident.</p>

      <p>"He is good, better than good," Klopp said. "The people involved were fine pretty quick. Things like this happen in football. Absolutely nothing to say about it.</p>
      <p>"The FA dealt with it how they saw right and I cannot judge that as I was not aware of the circumstances."</p>
      <p>Gomez could be in line to appear for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in their game against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> on Saturday after overcoming a knock to his knee while away which England, an injury which kept him out of the 4-0 victory over Kosovo on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Klopp has other injury worries, however, with Mo Salah, Andy Robertson and Joel Matip all expected to miss the clash with the Eagles, although Virgil van Dijk is expected to play after withdrawing from the Netherlands squad for personal reasons.</p>

      <p>“In the moment, yes, Virgil is 100 per cent available," Klopp added. "But it’s the time of the year when players get out of the squad overnight, unfortunately, with some other things – getting sick or ill or whatever.</p>
      <p>“From the others, I cannot say 100 per cent, I don’t know 100 per cent. Today is a very important session to judge that, especially with the players who came back late."</p>
