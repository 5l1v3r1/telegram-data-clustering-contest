      <p>If you've been on the lookout for Surface Pro 7 deals since the laptop-tablet hybrid's release in October 2019 you can't have had much luck. That all changes today, however. Microsoft has listed various configurations of their Surface Pro 7 devices with Type Cover keyboards for as little as £699 this weekend, potentially saving you an amazing £375 on some of the higher-end models all before <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a>. </p>
      <p>The Surface Pro 7 is the latest in Microsoft's lineup of 2-in-1 computers - boasting incredible processing speeds thanks to Intel's new 10-nanometer processors installed in even the cheapest specs you'll find on sale here. While the design and general feature set hasn't changed much beyond the previous Pro 6, you're getting a massive boost in raw power from the later model. The battery life doesn't match that of less powerful computers, but you're going to want to take this 2-in-1 for a spin, and you can always fast-charge on the go. Ultra-thin and amazingly portable, the Surface Pro range is ready for anything, with the Surface Pen and an incredibly light footprint. </p>
      <p>This Surface Pro 7 deal comes with the Type Cover keyboards included, so you're getting a far cheaper price on the tablet by itself and the otherwise pricey accessory included. We've built the bundles below using the standard £124.99 Surface Pro Type Cover, but you can also upgrade to the Signature or Special Editions for an extra premium. </p>
      <p>If you're looking for something with even more power, you'll want to take a look at this <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/this-surface-book-2-deal-cuts-an-incredible-pound630-off-the-asking-price">Surface Book 2 deal</a>. For just <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/config/Surface-Book-2/8MCPZJJCC98C?">£919</a> you can pick up a 13.5-inch Surface Book 2 with 8GB of RAM, a 7th gen i5 processor and a 128GB SSD - saving you £500! You can play with the exact specifications you're after and build your own perfect device, with that £500 saving transferring across each build. </p>
