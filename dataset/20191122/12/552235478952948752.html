      <h1>Man in court after importing deadly set of knuckledusters</h1>
      <h2>Case believed to be the first of its kind to come before Perth Sheriff Court</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:07:56+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:07</time> by <a rel="author">Perthshire Advertiser, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/perthshire-advertiser/</a></address>
      <p>A Perthshire man who illegally imported a variety of knuckledusters, some from China, to add to his bizarre collection of the deadly weapons dodged a jail term this week.</p>
      <p>Instead, 44-year-old Mark Campbell, of Harriet Row, Blairgowrie, will have to complete 120 hours of unpaid work within the next nine months.</p>
      <p>In what is believed to be the first case of its kind to come before Perth Sheriff Court, a total of 23 knuckledusters were ordered to be forfeited.</p>
      <p>They included four knuckleduster lock knives, two Zombie knife dusters, one spike duster and a ring duster.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Keith O’Mahony said: “I have never encountered an offence of this type before, that being the importation of knuckledusters.”</p>
      <p>He accepted, however, that Campbell had done that “on the basis of being a collector.”</p>
      <p>But he pointed out: “It’s also clear if they had fallen into the wrong hands they could have been used offensively.”</p>
      <p>Solicitor Steve Lafferty said that he hadn’t “come across” the legislation either.</p>
      <p>He added: “The accused accepted his culpability from the word go. His folly was that he didn’t accept an earlier warning from police.”</p>
      <p>Along with his father, who had since passed away, he had been collecting the items as a hobby.</p>
      <p>The accused, however, had been taking alcohol to excess and had been ordering the knuckledusters off the internet.</p>
      <p>He also had “significant mental health problems.”</p>
      <p>The accused had pointed out to officers that the items could take up to three months to arrive, some from places like China. Some of the items were worth as little as £2.</p>
      <p>Campbell admitted that between February 2 and April 16, 2019, at his home, he imported the prohibited or restricted items, contrary to the 1979 Customs and Excise Management Act and the 1988 Criminal Justice Act.</p>
      <p>In view of Campbell’s poor health, Sheriff O’Mahony extended the time allowed to complete the unpaid work from six to nine months.</p>
      <p>But he said: “I emphasise this is a direct alternative to a custodial sentence.”</p>
