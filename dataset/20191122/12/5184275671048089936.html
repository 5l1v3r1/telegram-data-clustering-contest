      <p>“I passed my written drivers test. My recipe for success was taking 20 back-to-back online tests and reading the entire California Driver Handbook slowly. #grind #yay.”</p>
      <p>Mindy is no stranger to reaping the fruits of her labour, as demonstrated by her exponential career success.</p>
      <p>“I think shooting (Late Night), three months after I had my first baby was something that made me proud of doing, and then just, I think my work on ‘The Office’ – I wrote 24 episodes of that show, and I worked so hard.I kind of essentially gave over my 20s and my love life and my friend life to that show,” she had earlier said.</p>
