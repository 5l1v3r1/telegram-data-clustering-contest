      <p>LONDON, Nov 22 — Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said today that defender Joe Gomez was “better than good” after his altercation with England teammate Raheem Sterling earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Manchester City forward Sterling initially clashed with Reds defender Gomez towards the end of the Premier League match between the sides on November 10 at Anfield.</p>
      <p>The pair were then involved in a fracas the following day on England duty, with Sterling later apologising at a team meeting and on social media.</p>
      <p>Sterling then sat out England’s Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro as punishment but returned to the starting line-up in the 4-0 victory over Kosovo on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Klopp said Gomez, who was left with a scratch on his face following the clash, had not been affected by the incident and the German had no issues with how the situation was handled.</p>
      <p>“He is good, better than good,” said Klopp. “The people involved were fine pretty quick. Things like this happen in football. Absolutely nothing to say about it.</p>
      <p>“The FA (Football Association) dealt with it how they saw right and I cannot judge that as I was not aware of the circumstances.” — Reuters</p>
