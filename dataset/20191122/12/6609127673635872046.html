      <p>The offence was committed on various occasions between May 2 and June 16, last year, when he was aged between three weeks and nine weeks old at addresses in the Falkirk area.</p>
      <p>The High Court in Glasgow heard that the baby suffered multiple rib fractures, bleeding on the brain,a broken right wrist, fractures to the base of both big toes and a detached retina.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Kath Harper said: "The accused told the police the injuries may have been caused when she dropped the baby and said some of the injuries could have been caused by a two-year-old child.</p>
      <p>Ms Harper told the court: "This is inconsistent with the medical findings.</p>
      <p>"It is the opinion of consultant paediatrician Rosemart Grattan that any injury causing bleeding on the brain has the potential to endanger life.”</p>
      <p>The court was told the injuries to the baby's feet are suggestive of an impact or crush injury and the injuries to the wrist and the ribs were consistents with a squeezing injury.</p>
      <p>The rib fractures required excessive force.</p>
      <p>Consultant ophthalmologist Jennifer Ann Gillen examined the baby's eyes and confirmed he had a detached retina. She said she had never seen this type of injury in a young baby and such an injury would require some form of blunt force trauma.</p>
      <p>The little boy who is now 19 months old cannot speak and is unable to walk, although he can crawl. Doctors say any assessment of long-term cannot be made until he is older.</p>
      <p>The court heard that on one occasion when Thomson was looking after the baby a neighbour heard the baby crying and the accused shouting: "Shut up you f***ing little bastard."</p>
      <p>Another neighbour said he heard the baby crying and Thomson screaming: "Would you shut the f*** up."</p>
      <p>Thomson denied shouting and swearing at the baby.</p>
      <p>When she was charged with assaulting the boy Thomson told police: "I would never hurt a baby."</p>
      <p>Judge Lady Rae told Thomson: "These were appalling injuries caused to a newborn. This is a very serious matter."</p>
      <p>She remanded Thomson in custody and deferred sentence until next month.</p>
      <p>Defence QC Bert Kerrigan will give his plea in mitigation then.</p>
