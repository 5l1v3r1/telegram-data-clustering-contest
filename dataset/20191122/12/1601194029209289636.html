      <p>After the group stages of the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/european-qualifiers">European Qualifiers</a> concluded after the most recent international break, the draw for the play-offs have also been revealed for the teams who cannot seal automatic qualification to tournament.</p>
      <p>20 teams have already qualified for <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a>, including holders <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/portugal-football">Portugal</a> and most of the usual suspects have also made it through, unlike the case in recent editions of a major tournament. <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/italy-football">Italy</a> and the Netherlands negotiated the qualifying stage comfortably, after missing out on the last two tournaments and Belgium also did so with an impeccable record in the qualifying stages.</p>
      <p>With regard to the playoffs, Scotland have been drawn against Israel as they aim to reach their first major tournament in 22 years. Steve Clarke's side will face one of Norway or Serbia in the semi-finals if they manage to get the better of Israel.</p>

      <p>Similarly, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland have been drawn against Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina and Slovakia respectively and the four play-off winners will join the 20 sides in England and Wales for the finals of Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>The play-off semi-finals will be played on March 26 and all games are one-off ties rather than two-legged affairs which are played home and away. The group stage draw for the tournament will be held on November 30, as teams eagerly wait to figure who they'll be drawn against.</p>
