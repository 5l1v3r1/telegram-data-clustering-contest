      <p>South Australian Premier Steven Marshall may have revealed a bit more than expected on his recent visit to the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/mortal-kombat/"><i>Mortal Kombat</i></a> set.</p>
      <p>The politician shared set photos from the upcoming adaptation of the popular video game franchise, which is filming at South Australia's Adelaide Studios. However, while the photos were meant to display the preparation that the stunt performers were putting in, one of the images reveals concept art for Reptile, Reiko, Goro and Kabal -- four characters who had not been previously announced for inclusion in the film. So far, the only characters announced have been Sub-Zero, Jax, Raiden, Mileena, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/mortal-kombat-liu-kang-training-video/">Liu Kang</a>, Kano, Sonya Blade, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/mortal-kombat-reboot-shang-tsung-scorpion/">Shang Tsung, Scorpion</a>, Kung Lao and <a href="https://screenrant.com/mortal-kombat-movie-reboot-nitara-cast/">Nitara</a>.</p>

      <p>While that is certainly an extensive list, fans of the fighting game series know there's a large wealth of characters to choose from, as each game revolves around a fighting tournament.</p>
      <p>The fantasy game series, created in 1992, currently consists of 11 main titles and multiple spinoffs. In 1995, the franchise received its first film adaptation, titled <i>Mortal Kombat</i>, which has since become a cult classic. However, that film received a 1997 sequel, <i>Mortal Kombat: Annihilation</i>, which was derided by both critics and fans.</p>
      <p>Attempts at a film reboot have been numerous since then, including a highly publicized unofficial film <i>Mortal Kombat: Rebirth</i>, until <i>The Conjuring </i>director James Wan signed on to officially produce a new adaptation. Australian commercial director Simon McQuoid was hired to direct the film and Greg Russo was hired to write the script.</p>

      <p>While video game adaptations are notoriously panned by critics, Russo's passion for the franchise and Wan's vow to not rush the production bodes well for the new production.</p>
      <p>Produced by James Wan, featuring the directorial debut of Simon McQuoid and starring Ludi Lin, Chin Han, Jessica McNamee, Hiroyuki Sanada, Joe Taslim, Mehcad Brooks, Josh Lawson, Sisi Stringer Elissa Cadwell and Tadanobu Asano, <i>Mortal Kombat</i> is expected to be in theaters March 5, 2021.</p>
