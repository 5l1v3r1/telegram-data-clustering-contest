      <p>The police arrested a man at an airport in New Delhi on Monday who they accused of dressing up as an airline pilot in an attempt to get preferential treatment.</p>
      <p>Rajan Mahbubani was detained while attempting to board an AirAsia flight at New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/india-fake-lufthansa-pilot-arrest/index.html">according to a report from CNN</a>.</p>
      <p>He was dressed in the uniform of a pilot for Germany’s flag carrier airline, Lufthansa.</p>
      <p>According to CNN, Mahbubani told authorities he had frequently dressed up as a pilot to secure perks like upgraded seats and access to crew-only lines at security and passport control.</p>
      <p>Mahbubani even had a fake Lufthansa pilots ID, the police said.</p>
      <p>Staff from the AirAsia flight he was trying to board, however, called Lufthansa to confirm his identity. He was arrested at the gate before getting on the flight to Kolkata.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/21/indian-businessman-wore-pilot-disguise-get-upgrades-special/">According to The Daily Telegraph</a>, the police accused Mahbubani of impersonating various uniformed professions in the past.</p>
      <p>The outlet quoted a Delhi airport police official named Sanjay Bhatia, who said Mahbubani had also posted videos on TikTok wearing different uniforms.</p>
      <p>“He had traveled on various occasions using the same modus operandi,” Bhatia said. “The travel history of the passenger is being scanned.”</p>
      <p>Mahbubani’s case has been compared to a less successful version of the movie “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71rDQ7z4eFg">Catch Me If You Can</a>,” which told the story of Frank Abagnale, who conned people out of millions of dollars in the 1960s using various disguises including that of a pilot.</p>
      <p>The Telegraph said the police also found pictures on Mahbubani’s phone of him dressed as an army colonel.</p>
      <p>An official for AirAsia acknowledged the arrest, saying in a statement reported by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/con-man-boards-over-15-flights-as-pilot-held/articleshow/72122446.cms">The Times of India</a>: “He was handed over to the airport police and an investigation has been ordered.”</p>
      <p>The incident is the second involving elaborate disguises to emerge from Delhi in recent months. In September, 32-year-old Jayesh Patel was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/indian-man-old-man-disguise-fake-passport-2019-9?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">arrested after authorities said he dressed up as an old man,</a> including dying his hair white, to try to get on a plane to the US.</p>
      <p>Patel tried to board a flight to New York using a passport with the fake name of Amrik Singh, an 81-year-old born in Delhi in February 1938, the Central Industrial Security Force said.</p>
