      <p>Inter manager <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/antonio-conte/">Antonio Conte</a> has revealed that he advises his players to have sex ‘with the minimum of effort’ during the season.</p>
      <p>The issue of players having sex before matches has been raised before with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/11/15/how-guardiolas-bizarre-sex-ban-helped-messi-at-barcelona-6258539/">Samir Nasri claiming that </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/11/15/how-guardiolas-bizarre-sex-ban-helped-messi-at-barcelona-6258539/"> manager </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/pep-guardiola/">Pep Guardiola</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/11/15/how-guardiolas-bizarre-sex-ban-helped-messi-at-barcelona-6258539/"> had banned his squad from intercourse during the evening before a match</a>.</p>
      <p>The topic has not only limited to football as several boxers have adopted similar tactics, including former world super-middleweight world champion Carl Froch who underwent a self-imposed three-month spell of abstinence before his fight against George Groves in 2014.</p>
      <p>But while Conte does not ban his players from having sex, the former Chelsea manager admits he urges his squad to keep it short and let their partners do the work.</p>

      <p>‘During the season, I advise my players to have sex for short periods and with the minimum of effort, and better use positions where they are under their partners,’ Conte said in an interview with L’Equipe.</p>
      <p>‘And preferably, with their wives, because if with others, well, that needs extra action.’</p>
      <p>Conte, who won the Premier League title with Chelsea in 2017 and three Serie A titles during his time as manager of Juventus, became Inter boss earlier this summer.</p>
