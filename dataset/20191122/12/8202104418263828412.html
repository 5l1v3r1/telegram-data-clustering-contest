      <h3>Article by article, the story of this province’s need for addictions services has come together over 2019.</h3>
      <p>Just in the past few days, the pages of The StarPhoenix and Leader-Post have carried pieces that outline the importance of this issue.</p>
      <p>The family of <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/crime/man-denied-in-patient-addictions-treatment-months-before-killing-28-year-old-man-family-says">Tyrone Nontell, who was convicted of killing 28-year-old Tyrell Bird in Prince Albert</a>, says the crime may never have taken place if the perpetrator was able to access the in-patient treatment he needed for a cocaine addiction.</p>
      <p>His sister, Shelly Laliberte, told Postmedia that Nontell had wanted to get into treatment, but was only able to access outpatient assistance.</p>
      <p>“He was completely willing to get help. He knew he needed help and he knew he couldn’t do it by himself. And I really do think all this could have been prevented by that,” she said.</p>
      <p>The number of people who are using drugs and may need treatment is clearly challenging. This was illustrated as a study in the American Journal of Public Heath reported <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/sask-needle-distribution-is-triple-the-national-average-study">Saskatchewan gives out more needles per capita than any other Canadian province</a>. Based on research by Université de Montréal, the article states seven needles for every resident of Saskatchewan, or 711 for every person who injected drugs that year, were distributed. This is more than three times the national average. In all, 5,276,496 needles and syringes were distributed in 2016 to combat Saskatchewan’s crisis of blood-borne illnesses, particularly HIV and Hepatitis C.</p>
      <p>Intravenous drug use is considered the largest contributing factor to Saskatchewan’s dismal record on HIV transmission, and addressing addiction would mean also tackling this health crisis. And of course, many drug users need programs that tackle the root causes of their addictions — in addition to having access to clean needles.</p>
      <p>In the midst of these concerning reports, there are also signs of the <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/addition-of-in-patient-beds-reducing-wait-times-at-calder-centre">difference that increased beds and funding can make</a> to the lives of Saskatchewan people fighting addiction. In June, six beds were added to the Calder Centre in Saskatoon, which offers four-week in-patient care and outpatient addictions treatment. The wait time, which once hovered around 12 weeks, is now down to two weeks.</p>
      <p>Around the province, families are anxiously waiting for access to treatment, hoping their loved ones can avoid the fate of Tyrone Nontell. They want a different ending to their story.</p>
      <p>Throwing money at a problem — including government money — is a simplistic way to approach a complicated issue like addictions. But there is proof that a well-considered, well-resourced plan can save lives. More stories like those out of the Calder Centre can build a new, more hopeful narrative.</p>
