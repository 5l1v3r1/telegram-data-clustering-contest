      <h1>EU chief Juncker leaves hospital</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:30:12+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Outgoing European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has returned home to Luxembourg after stomach surgery that kept him hospitalised for more than a week, a spokeswoman said Friday.</p>
      <p>The 64-year-old head of the EU's executive is at the end of his five-year mandate and is expected to hand over the reins to Ursula von der Leyen, Germany's former defence minister, at the end of next week.</p>
      <p>His November 11 surgery, to treat an aortic aneurysm in his abdomen, and subsequent convalescence in a German hospital meant he was unable to appear as a witness in a Luxembourg trial dealing with a case back from 2007 when Juncker was Luxembourg's premier.</p>
      <p>The trial was meant to be held in November 2017 but was delayed because of Juncker's packed agenda as Brussels' top EU official.</p>
      <p>Twelve hearings had been set aside for the case, in which three agents of Luxembourg's SREL intelligence agency are accused of using illegal wiretaps.</p>
      <p>Fall-out from that scandal triggered an election that saw Juncker pushed from power after 18 years at Luxembourg's helm.</p>
      <p>Von der Leyen is expected to become the new European Commission president from December 1.</p>
      <p>EU ambassadors in Brussels were holding a meeting Friday to approve the list of her commissioners.</p>
      <p>That team has been drawn from all EU member states -- except Brexit-bound Britain, which has refused to nominate a commissioner because it is in a campaign period leading up to December 12 elections.</p>
      <p>The European Commission has started legal action against London for breaching that obligation.</p>
      <p>Britain has a final deadline of midnight Friday (2300 GMT) to offer up a name, but is considered unlikely to do so.</p>
      <p>With Britain scheduled to leave the EU at the end of January, the Commission's move is a legal gambit to head off any future challenge to decisions made without a full roster of commissioners from all current member states.</p>
