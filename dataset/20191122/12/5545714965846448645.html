      <p>Bandai Namco has released a lengthy gameplay video of Ace Combat 7's upcoming DLC Ten Million Relief Plan. The near ten-minute video features a mission briefing and some high-flying, dog-fighting action, set against a golden sunset.<br/><br/><i>Ten Million Relief Plan</i> will be the final piece of the DLC "trilogy" that began in September with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../ace-combat-7-trailer-sees-unexpected-visitor-dlc-take-flight-568032.phtml"><i>Unexpected Visitor</i></a>, and was then followed up in October with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../ace-combat-7-plot-heavy-trailer-precedes-anchorhead-raid-dlc-569890.phtml">Anchorhead Raid.</a> Ten Million Relief Plan will bring an end to the arc of The Alicorn, an immensely powerful submarine that is posing a devastating nuclear threat to the world.<br/><br/>It's your outfit's duty to plant sonar receivers to ascertain the location of the Alicorn, before pinpointing its exact coordinates, relay this information to base, and then prepare for a strike against this dangerous vessel. It's all hands on deck for this mission, as the consequences of failure would be absolutely devastating.</p>
