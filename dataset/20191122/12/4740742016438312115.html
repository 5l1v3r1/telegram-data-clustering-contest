      <p>The new rugby season is well underway but with injuries beginning to mount up and with one eye on next season directors of rugby up and down the land are turning their attention to rugby transfer market.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rugby">Bristol Bears</a> in their second season back at the top table of European rugby, playing in the Gallagher Premiership and European Challenge Cup, we take a look at all the latest transfer news and rumours from them and their rivals.</p>
      <p>Here is all the latest.</p>

      <h3>Quins win race to keep Dombrandt </h3>
      <p>Harlequins have reportedly fought off interest from Northampton Saints and Bath Rugby to keep hold of breakout back row star Alex Dombrandt. </p>
      <p>The powerful 22-year-old number eight is out of contract at The Twickenham Stoop at the end of the season and big things are expected of him having been called up to train as part of England’s preliminary Rugby World Cup training squad. </p>
      <p>He missed the cut for the 31-man squad for Japan but there is an obvious vacancy for a back-up number eight in the England squad behind Saracens star Billy Vunipola, and Dombrandt, along with Bath’s Zach Mercer, Bristol Bears’ Nathan Hughes and Exeter Chiefs’ Sam Simmomds are all leading contenders for the job </p>
      <p>The Rugby Paper reports Quins have secured Dombrandt, who they signed as an amateur from Cardiff Met University, on a three year contract.</p>

      <h3>Leicester Tigers given Manu Tuilagi boost amongst rugby league rumours</h3>
      <p>England star centre Manu Tuilagi says he is planning to see out his current contract at Leicester Tigers despite a potential huge money offer to join newly promoted Super League club Toronto Wolfpack.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old centre, who was a key part of England's run to the World Cup final after final overcoming injury problems which have plagued much of his career, signed a new deal with Tigers in March.</p>
      <p>Speaking about his plans, Tuilagi said: "At the moment, I don't want to look to the future too far ahead,"</p>
      <p>Before signing a new contract with Leicester Tuilagi rejected an offer from Paris-based Top-14 side Racing 92.</p>
      <p>"You have to focus on the now, and for me, I've two years at Tigers," Tuilagi added.</p>
      <p>Toronto Wolfpack have confirmed they have spoken to Tuilagi's representatives and it is widely known that his agents will at least have a discussion with any club willing to make an offer.</p>
      <p>Speaking to The Rugby Paper, Toronto coach Brian McDermott said: “I know David [Argyle, the Toronto Wolfpack owner] is talking to Manu’s people.</p>
      <p>“He hasn’t spoken to Manu but with his representatives and it’s where it was with Sonny [Bill Williams, who has signed a two-year deal worth a reported £5m] to start with. It’s not a no.</p>
      <p>Tuilagi reportedly discussed switching to Rugby League earlier this year, holding talks with Warrington Wolves before agreeing a new deal with Leicester, keeping him at Welford Road until 2021.</p>
      <p>However Toronto are reportedly willing to pay off the rest of Tuilagi’s contract to immediately land the rugby union superstar.</p>
      <p>Super League clubs are able to spend huge sums on players outside of their salary cap if they have never played professional rugby league before, which is how Wolfpack would be able to go after Tuilagi.</p>

      <h3>Sale Sharks on the hunt for second row reinforcements</h3>
      <p>Sale Sharks director of rugby Steve Diamond is looking for some midseason reinforcements in the second row after two serious injuries to key men in his squad. </p>
      <p>Josh Beaumont (knee) and South African World Champion Lood de Jäger have both suffered long-term injuries, with the Springbok expected to miss six months with his shoulder injury. </p>
      <p>Diamond is now looking to add additional recruits reports The Rugby Paper.</p>

      <h3>Bristol Bears sign kiwi flanker</h3>
      <p>Bristol Bears have signed highly rated New Zealand U20s back rower Adrian Choat as injury cover until the end of season.</p>
      <p>With Sam Jeffries taking a break from the professional game, Choat – who is English qualified through a grandparent – makes the switch to the West Country in November.</p>
      <p>A versatile loose forward who can play across the back row, the 21-year-old represented New Zealand U20s in the 2017 Junior World Championship and played for Auckland in the 2019 Mitre 10 Cup.</p>
      <p>Director of Rugby Pat Lam said: “We were eager to bring in somebody of Adrian’s attitude and ability to give us cover in a key area for the season ahead.</p>
      <p>“With Sam Jeffries unavailable to play and Jordan Crane and Sam Graham returning to fitness, Adrian [Choat] comes in to bolster our back-row options, alongside Luke Hamilton, who arrived earlier this month.</p>
      <p>“Adrian is English qualified with a good pedigree, so we look forward to welcoming him to the Bears.”</p>
      <p>Choat will return to Auckland at the end of Bristol Bears’ 2019/20 campaign.</p>

      <h3>Leicester Tigers boss says Ellis Genge wants to stay</h3>
      <p>England prop Ellis Genge's club future appears to still be up in the air despite the latest reassurances from Geordan Murphy</p>
      <p>Last week <a href="https://www.therugbypaper.co.uk/features/34191/ellis-genge-set-to-snub-bristol-and-stay-a-leicester-tiger/">The Rugby Paper</a> reported Genge's former club <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rugby">Bristol Bears</a> had made an offer for the Leicester Tigers loosehead to return to Ashton Gate next season but it fell short of expectations.</p>
      <p>The publication reports he is close to signing a new three-year deal at Welford Road.</p>
      <p>Genge, who now has 14 caps for England, left Bristol for Leicester Tigers midway through the 2015/16 season, following a series of problems both on the field, and off it.</p>
      <p>However Bears director of rugby Pat Lam, who arrived after the frontrower had moved on, has made no secret of the fact that he is a big admirer of the prop and would like to bring him back to the West Country.</p>
      <p>Speaking back in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/we-would-love-bring-ellis-2874503">May as a guest on BT Sport's Rugby Tonight</a> , Lam said: “Would we like Ellis Genge to come home? Of course we would.”</p>
      <p>In the past Genge has also expressed his desire to one day return to Bristol.</p>
      <p>Bristol currently have four senior loosehead props at the club in Samoan international brothers James, 25, and Jordan Lay, 27, Yann Thomas, 29 and Jake Woolmore, 28.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday Leicester Tigers director of rugby Geordan Murphy confirmed contract negotiations with Genge are "ongoing" with the Midlands club keen to keep hold of one of their stand-out stars.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/leicester-tigers-winger-jonny-could-3554323">Leicester Mercury</a> , Murphy said: "We have been in contract negotiations with Ellis since before the World Cup, as with some of the other guys who there has been huge speculation about.</p>
      <p>"When the guys were away we stepped down our chat in order to let them focus on the World Cup.</p>
      <p>"Ellis has come back and has been very vocal about telling us he wants to re-sign and contract negotiations are ongoing."</p>
      <p>However the situation has been confused further by regular social media user Genge's tweet to BBC Radio Leicester journalist Adam Whitty.</p>

      <p>The saga certainly doesn't seem to be over just yet.</p>

      <h3>Forwards coach Toby Booth joins Harlequins</h3>
      <p>Former Bath Rugby coach Toby Booth has joined Harlequins as an assistant coach, supporting Paul Gustard and his coaching team for the remainder of the 2019/20 season.</p>
      <p>Booth served as first team coach at Bath from 2012 until June 2019 when he left as part of a coaching shake-up which saw Stuart Hooper replace Todd Blackadder as director of rugby of the Blue, Black and Whites.</p>
      <p>Bath play Harlequins on Saturday evening in their second game of the Heineken Champions Cup, with both sides essentially needing victory to keep their hopes of progressing out of the group alive having lost to Ulster and Clermont respectively last weekend.</p>

      <h3>Bath linked with Wales and Lions scrum half</h3>
      <p>Bath Rugby have former Wales and Lions scrum half Rhys Webb on their radar according to the latest reports.</p>
      <p>Webb, 30, is under contract to Toulon for another 18 months but his fiancé and three children returned to Wales earlier in the year after failing to settle on the Cote D’Azur and <a href="https://www.therugbypaper.co.uk/">The Rugby Paper</a> reports Webb has a clause in his contract with the French Top 14 club which allows him to before entering into the final year of his deal.</p>
      <p>However with Webb in the international wilderness after falling below the required 60-caps to be eligible for selection and not play for one of the Welsh regions meaning a return to Wales could be more favourable.</p>
      <p>Bath are also likely to face competition from Exeter Chiefs who are also on the hunt for a world class from half.</p>

      <h3>Exeter Chiefs, Bath and Northampton Saints eye Ross Moriarty</h3>
      <p>Exeter Chiefs are reported to be leading the chase to sign Wales and Dragons number eight Ross Moriarty.</p>
      <p>The former Gloucester backrower only joined the Dragons last season but the chance of big paycheck in the Gallagher Premiership could draw him back according to England according to The Rugby Paper, even though that would make the 41-cap Welsh international ineligible for international selection.</p>
      <p>Toulon, Montpellier and Lyon are also reported to be interested in securing the services of the powerful ball carrier.</p>

      <h3>Welsh backrow star linked with Bristol Bears</h3>
      <p>The Rugby Paper reports 72 cap Welsh international <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/bristol-bears-linked-72-cap-3547008">Justin Tipuric has been handed a £500,000 a season offer from the Bears to switch the Ospreys for Bristol Bears next season.</a></p>
      <p>Tipuric, 30, has spent his entire professional career at Ospreys but is out of contract at the end of the season according to the reports.</p>
      <p>The outstanding flanker, who also has one cap for the British and Irish Lions having been selected for the 2013 and 2017 tours, is also reportedly wanted by French Top 14 heavyweights Clermont Auvergne, Toulon and Toulouse which is potentially why the offer for the flanker is so high, if accurate.</p>
      <p>Bears director of rugby Pat Lam has previously voiced his frustration at Bristol being used as a negotiating tool by agents to drive up the fee for players.</p>
      <p>Justin Tipuric’s representatives have denied a report suggesting the Wales and Ospreys forward is weighing up a £500,000-a-year offer to join Bristol Bears.</p>

      <h3>Tug of war for Saracens star</h3>
      <p>Welsh full-back Liam Williams is a man in demand back in his home country.</p>
      <p>Williams, 28, who has 62 caps for Wales and three for the British and Irish Lions, is expected to leave Saracens at the end of the season and both Ospreys and Scarlets are keen to add him to their ranks.</p>
      <p>Ospreys head coach Allen Clarke said: “If Liam ia interested in coming back to Wales we want to attack that sort of player.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got limited resources in that position with only one recognised full-back so we would be foolish not to consider a player of his quality. Certainly it is an area we wish to recruit in.”</p>

      <h3>Chiefs sign Pumas prop</h3>
      <p>Exeter Chiefs have bolstered their squad with the signing of Argentinian prop Enrique Pieretto until the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Chiefs’ Director of Rugby, Rob Baxter, has moved swiftly to capture the 24-year-old forward following injuries to fellow tight-heads Tomas Francis and Greg Holmes.</p>
      <p>Francis suffered a serious shoulder injury during Wales’ Rugby World Cup semi-final against South Africa in Japan and is now likely to be sidelined for up to four months following surgery.</p>
      <p>Holmes, meanwhile, has been out of action with a troublesome Achilles injury since Exeter’s Premiership Rugby Cup game at Leicester Tigers back in September – and he too is not expected to return until the New Year.</p>
      <p>The double blow is certainly untimely for Baxter, but on the flip side the arrival of Pieretto could not have come at a more opportune time as the Pumas star – who featured at the World Cup – is currently in England and played for the Barbarians in Saturday’s clash against Fiji at Twickenham.</p>
      <h3>England U18s full back joins Sale</h3>
      <p>Sale Sharks have confirmed the singing of England U18 full-back Joe Carpenter from Yorkshire Carnegie on a long-term academy contract.</p>
      <p>Carpenter, 18, put pen to paper on a deal with Sale over the summer after a lack of opportunity for senior academy players at Yorkshire Carnegie forced their management to look for other opportunities for players in their pathway.</p>
      <p>Born in Leeds, Carpenter has been involved in the Yorkshire Carnegie academy set-up since 2016. He is an elusive runner that possess exceptional pace and is widely regarded as one of the most exciting academy prospects in the country.</p>

      <h3>Quins centre pens new deal with includes Super Rugby loan</h3>
      <p>Exciting young centre Joe Marchant has signed a new three-year contract extension with Harlequins.</p>
      <p>However the 23-year-old will also join Super Rugby side the Blues on loan in January for the 2020 season..</p>
      <p>Marchant, who made his England debut against Wales, will remain at the Stoop until 2023.</p>
      <p>Marchant said: "I'm really excited to be given the chance to play Super Rugby," he said.</p>
      <p>"I'm sure I will learn a lot and I can't wait to bring that back to the club in June."</p>
      <h3>Experienced prop signs new deal at Exiles</h3>
      <p>London Irish have announced forward Ollie Hoskins has agreed an extension to his existing contract with the club.</p>
      <p>Hoskins, who has made 75 appearances and scored 16 times for the club, was a key part of the 2018/19 Championship winning squad and has been a prominent member of the starting XV in the early stages of this campaign.</p>
      <p>“We are very happy that Ollie has agreed to extend his contract with us” explained Declan Kidney, director of rugby.</p>
      <p>“Since he joined London Irish in 2016, Ollie has been a fantastic professional on and off the pitch. We are looking forward to Ollie continuing on this journey with us.”</p>
