      <p>Abimbola “Abel” Osundairo one-half of the Nigerian brothers involved the <a href="https://guardian.ng/tag/jussie-smollett/">Jussie Smollett</a> alleged staged <a href="https://guardian.ng/life/jussie-smollett-involved-in-suspected-homophobic-and-racist-attack/">homophobic and racist attack</a> has scored himself a film role.</p>
      <p>Abel will be playing the lead role “Dushon” in an upcoming film titled “Friends, Family &amp; Lovers” TMZ reports.</p>
      <p>The film is directed and co-written by Michael Ballard, who also co-wrote the Master P produced comedy “I Got the Hook Up 2,” and is set to screen this weekend at the University of Chicago.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it appears that Jussie Smollet’s career is on the hold in the meantime as the former “Empire” actor is still battling the city of Chicago.</p>
      <p>Smollett recently filed a countersuit against the City of Chicago claiming malicious prosecution. He accused the city, police and others of causing “substantial economic damages as well as reputational harm, humiliation, mental anguish and extreme emotional distress,” and says he’s seeking compensation.</p>
      <p>In the suit, Smollet also included the Osundairo brothers. The brothers’ lawyers, Gloria Schmidt told TMZ</p>
      <blockquote><i>“This is just another sad attempt by Jussie Smollett to try and falsely smear the Osundario brothers, the City of Chicago and the Chicago Police Department. There is no legal merit to his claims, and could be sanctionable.”<br/></i><br/>Schmidt adds, <i>“The brothers were open and honest with the Chicago Police Department, testified under oath in front of a Grand Jury, and stand ready to do so again, in open court, if and when called upon to do so.”</i></blockquote>
      <p>On January 29, 2019, American actor Jussie Smollett told police that he was attacked in the early morning at the 300 block of East Lower North Water Street in Chicago’s Streeterville by two people he falsely described as white men who physically attacked him after racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unknown chemical substance, possibly bleach, on him and tied a rope around his neck.</p>
      <p>On February 20, 2019, Smollett was indicted for disorderly conduct consisting of allegedly paying two Nigerian-American brothers <a href="https://guardian.ng/life/new-evidence-suggests-jussie-smollett-may-have-staged-his-attack/">to stage a fake hate crime assault on him and filing a false police report</a>. Smollett’s defence team reached a deal with prosecutors on March 26, 2019, in which all charges were dropped in return for Smollett performing community service and forfeiting his $10,000 bond.</p>
