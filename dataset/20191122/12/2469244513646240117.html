      <p>Following its huge success over the last three years, Warrens Bakery has only gone and done it again and announced the return of the extraordinary mince pie and custard pasty.</p>
      <p>Back by popular demand, for a limited time only, the quirky handmade sweet pasty is filled with mincemeat and custard, encased in a cocktail pasty case and sprinkled with sugar.</p>
      <p>It always gets tongues wagging as it's perfect for satisfying both your sweet and savoury festive cravings as well as being an innovative twist on a traditional favourite.</p>

      <p>Jason Jobling, master baker at Warrens Bakery, comments: “The Cornish twist to the traditional mince pie has proven to be a success with our customers in previous years so it makes sense to bring it back for a limited time this year.</p>
      <p>"This pasty is handmade using rough puff pastry and hand filled with specially selected mincemeat and a vanilla custard.</p>
      <p>"It’s crimped by hand in the same way we would a savoury pasty then glazed and topped with a cinnamon and sugar blend for extra crunch.”</p>

      <p>The bakery has also introduced a twist on a popular sweet customer favourite, the Festive Fruit Danish. This is a combination of sweet glazed bread which is layered with raisins, sultanas, glacé cherries and mixed peel, and topped with nibbed sugar.</p>
      <p>The Luxury Star Mince Pie is also tempting - made up of crumbly shortcrust pastry filled with matured mincemeat, topped with an exquisite pastry star and dusted with icing sugar.</p>
