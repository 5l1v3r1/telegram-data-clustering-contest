        <b><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a> was asked few questions about Saturday’s opponents in his pre-match press conference ahead of <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</a> vs. Liverpool.</b>

      <p>Instead, there were questions on <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/joe-gomez/">Joe Gomez</a>‘s mindset after the incident with Raheem Sterling, on Jose Mourinho’s return to the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> and Mauricio Pochettino’s sacking, and on <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/xherdan-shaqiri/">Xherdan Shaqiri</a>‘s return to fitness.</p>
      <p>The Reds’ boss, though, was also asked as to why Palace are a difficult opponent for his side – despite Liverpool having won six of their last seven meetings against the South London side.</p>
      <p>Speaking on injuries, Klopp played it coy over the fitness of <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/mohamed-salah/">Mohamed Salah</a>, admitting that his ankle injury persists to be an issue.</p>
      <p>“It’s not that it got worse, but it’s still there,” said Klopp. “That’s the problem. We have to be sensible”</p>
      <p>There was good news on <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/virgil-van-dijk/">Virgil van Dijk</a>, though, after the Dutchman had been removed from international duty early this week, and no other players return from internationals with any injuries.</p>
      <p>Klopp was asked about the title race but turned the question on its head by saying the only time he thinks about it is when he gets asked about it.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think about this,” he said. “The biggest challenge is facing constantly questions about it.</p>
      <p>“So far it’s a normal season – we try to get as many points as we can. The challenges are the 26 games we have left to play.”</p>
      <p>Asked about the future run of busy games every weekend and mid-week, Klopp again made a veiled dig at reporters by adding that that means press conferences every two or three days also!</p>
      <p>Liverpool play at Selhurst Park on Saturday (3pm), then host Napoli in the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/champions-league">Champions League</a> on Wednesday.</p>
