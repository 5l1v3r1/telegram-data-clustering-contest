        <b>A student from Kibabii University was brutally attacked by an unknown assailant in the wee hours of Friday, November 22 morning ahead of the institution's 4th Graduation ceremony that was presided over by President Uhuru Kenyatta. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The 21-year-old Bachelor of Science (Renewable Energy and Bio-Fuels Technology) student from Kirinyaga County was sexually assaulted and her left arm chopped off in the harrowing incident. </p>
      <p>The victim told <i>NTV </i>reporters that she only recalled being in the company of her friends at around 11 p.m. before the attack that saw her comrades manage to flee to safety. </p>
      <p>“The lady came in bleeding from an area that was cut, the left upper limb completely amputated. She came in having lost a lot of blood. Her state was semi-conscious although she is able to identify herself and give some history,” Dr.Martin Mbati, a doctor at the Bungoma West Hospital told journalists.</p>

      <p>A report by <i>K24 Digital</i> indicated that the assailant chopped off her arm wrapped it in her brassiere and threw it on the roof of a residence near where the student lived at around 5 a.m. with neighbours failing to respond to her cries for help out of fear. </p>
      <p>“Her assailant did not only cut her arm but also raped her. We are taking her to the theatre to manage the injuries,” the doctor is quoted by the publication while confirming the unfortunate news that they were not able to reattach the limb.</p>
      <p>Her condition is reported to be stable after an urgent blood transfusion.</p>
      <p>President Uhuru Kenyatta, who is also the Kibabii University Chancellor, arrived at the institution at around midday on Friday to preside over a graduation ceremony that where a total of 620 degrees and diplomas were conferred.</p>
      <p>Uhuru pledged to allocate Ksh100 million to the university for infrastructural upgrades in a meeting help with the university council and its management. </p>
