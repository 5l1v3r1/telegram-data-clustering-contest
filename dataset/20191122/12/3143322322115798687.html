      <p>MBOMBELA – Yassine Es-Qalli (28) has been exploring Africa on his bicycle for the past 20 months. The Moroccan national arrived in Mbombela last week, where he sought out the company of his fellow countrymen.</p>
      <p>He has been able to rely on such kindnesses for much of his journey so far. The cycling enthusiast started his journey<br/>in Morocco on March 8 last year. He has since traversed the continent’s west coast through Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia and Guinea Bissau, before finally making his way to South Africa.</p>
      <p>“I have always been an avid cyclist and had explored Morocco on my bicycle,” EsQalli said.</p>

      <p>“Then it dawned on me that there was so much more to see in Africa. It has been a privilege to be embraced by my fellow Africans.”</p>
      <p>Contrary to his expectations, the journey was not as perilous as one would think, and Es-Qalli said he was often provided with accommodation and food in whichever village his travels led him to.<br/>His worst experiences were contracting malaria eight times and the numerous checkpoints in some countries.</p>
      <p>“The most exciting and heartwarming aspect was the way in which I was embraced everywhere I arrived. I had no idea about people in other African countries and this experience has opened a whole deeper understanding of the continent.”</p>

      <p>How do you get on a bicycle and start cycling through countries of which you had no knowledge hitherto? For Es-Qalli the answer is simple.</p>
      <p>“I saved up some money, arranged my visa and survived through the generosity of people who took an interest in<br/>what I was attempting.”</p>
      <p>He cites sampling the local cuisine and connecting with locals as energising, and added that this welcoming spirit kept the will to go on alive within him.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, he was at the SPAR Courtside branch of Moroccan Barber and was welcomed by the team who pledged<br/>their assistance as he makes his return journey.<br/><b><br/>ALSO READ: <a href="https://lowvelder.co.za/514659/irr-voices-opposition-proposed-nhi-bill/">The IRR voices its opposition to the proposed NHI Bill</a></b></p>

      <p>“Since arriving here, I crossed the Beitbridge border and cycled through Polokwane and then on to Johannesburg,<br/>Kimberley, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Ficksburg and Ermelo before making my way back to Mbombela.”</p>
      <p>On Monday he will start cycling back home to Morocco through Mozambique and on to the east coast of Africa. After he reaches home, he plans to journey through South America on his bicycle.</p>
      <p>“You need to be resilient, strong and have an independent streak if you are considering hopping on your bike and exploring the world around you,” Es-Qalli added.</p>
