      <h1>Perth and Kinross Council receives 37 complaints a week</h1>
      <h2>2018/19 figure is 141 more than the previous year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:22:46+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:22</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Cargill, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-cargill/</a></address>
      <p>Perth and Kinross Council received over 37 complaints about its services every week in 2018/19.</p>
      <p>The local authority logged a total of 1948 complaints last year - 141 more than it received the year before and 311 more in 2016/17 .</p>
      <p>A report going before a committee next week says 1803 of the complaints PKC got in 2018/19 were “resolved” at the first stage of its Complaints Handling Procedure (CHP).</p>
      <p>It adds 1170 of those complaints were “responded” to within five working days but the other 633 had to be responded to “within [an] extended timescale”.</p>
      <p>And it goes on to say a further 100 complaints “processed” at the first stage of the CHP were then “escalated” to the second stage and another 45 complaints had to be considered at the second stage right away “due to their complexity/sensitivity”.</p>
      <p>Breaking down the complaints it received by service, the report then reveals 736 resolved at the first stage related to “service provision”, 371 were about individual employees, 229 related to “policy and procedure”, 202 were to do with “communication”, five were related to “equality” and 260 were to do with “other” matters.</p>
      <p>And out of the 145 dealt with at the second stage, 66 involved “service provision”, 23 concerned employees, 35 were to do with “policy and procedure”, 14 related to “communication”, three were to do with “equality” and the other four again involved unspecified “other” matters.</p>
      <p>Further down the report it states the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman (SPSO) only issued four decision reports concerning complaints about PKC during 2018/19 but was actually asked to consider a total of 48 during the period.</p>
      <p>It says out of the 44 complaints the SPSO dismissed, seven were “not duly made ... withdrawn or resolved”, six were made “prematurely”, another seven were “outwith the SPSO’s jurisdiction or sought an outcome which was not achievable” and in the 24 other cases “the SPSO considered that it was not proportionate to carry out an investigation”.</p>
      <p>The report concludes: “The council has an appropriate and effective CHP and will work to ensure that revisions are made in line with forthcoming SPSO recommendations. Performance statistics from 2018/19 demonstrate that our complaints handling is acceptable and effective.</p>
      <p>“Performance information and the subject matter of complaints received is considered and monitored to identify any particular trends, issues or service areas which require focussed improvement efforts.</p>
      <p>“No such areas have been identified from CHP information for 2018/19.”</p>
      <p>The council’s scrutiny committee is scheduled to review the report and its appendices next Wednesday afternoon, November 27.</p>
