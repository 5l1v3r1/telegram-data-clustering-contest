      <p>Swedru, Nov. 22, GNA - Government has repackaged and re-awarded contracts on Swedru roads to enhance the quality of life of residents, Mrs. Justina Marigold Assan, Agona West Municipal Chief Executive (MCE), has assured.  </p>
      <p>The MCE said road projects were dear to President Akufo-Addo and that Agona West would benefited from the second phase of the Sinohydro Chinese facility to construct more roads in the Municipality.  </p>
      <p>Mrs. Assan was addressing Meet-the-Press programme organised by Agona West Municipal Assembly at Swedru on her remarkable and unprecedented achievements chalked within three years in office.</p>
      <p>The Meet-the-Press had been instituted by Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development and Ministry of Information to help MMDAs to account the stewardship of the Assemblies’ leadership to local people.   </p>
      <p>Mrs. Assan disclosed that the Assembly had executed a total of 153 infrastructural projects since the NPP took power from the previous government.    </p>
      <p>She assured the Chiefs, the youth groups, taxi and commercial drivers, market women and other identifiable groups in and around Agona Swedru to exercise restraint since the roads would soon be repaired.  </p>
      <p>She said many other remarkable and unprecedented infrastructural achievements had been chalked under the visionary and courageous President Nana Addo-Dankwa Akufo-Addo.</p>
      <p> They include heath, education, roads, sanitation, and provision of portable water, employment, Agriculture, one District One factory programme and others,she said. </p>
      <p>On agriculture, the Assembly had distributed 50,000 hybrid palm oil seedlings free of charge to over 80 farmers in the Agona West under the planting for export and Rural Development.</p>
      <p>The MCE said massive classroom blocks had been built in the Municipality to improve quality teaching and learning, adding that Assembly was also receiving support from the Central government to provide more teaching materials and offer motivation to teachers.</p>
      <p>Mr. Thomas Yaw Adjei Baffoe, Deputy Central Regional Minister, also assured the residents of Swedru that the bad roads would be fixed in the area.</p>
      <p>He said President Akufo-Addo would not disappoint Ghanaians but would fulfil all the promises in the NPP manifesto.  </p>
      <p>He said the government under President Akufo-Addo through prudent economic management, had made Ghana one of fastest growing economies in sub-Sahara Africa and the rest of the World. </p>
      <p>The Deputy Central Regional Minister said if Ghanaians gave President Akufo-Addo another four year term, the country would become one of the best countries that would attract more local and foreign investors.</p>
