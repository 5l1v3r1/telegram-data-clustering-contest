      <h1>TSB says it's fixed its latest glitch after problems left people without wages</h1>
      <h2>The bank has said that everyone should now be seeing the right amount of money in their accounts after issues overnight left people missing cash they were due</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:29:05+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:29</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>TSB has said it has resolved all the issues resulting from its payments glitch today.</p>
      <p>Problems left some customers without wages in their accounts, after overnight payments failed to go through.</p>
      <p>To help, TSB said those affected could contact the bank, by going into branches or by phone. It added customers could use their cards to make payments or withdraw cash.</p>
      <p>A TSB spokesman said: "Some payments into TSB accounts have been delayed overnight and we are working to process these as soon as possible today.</p>
      <p>"We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and will ensure customers are not left out of pocket."</p>
      <p>It is understood the error was caused by a processing delay.</p>

      <p>Gareth Shaw, head of money at consumer group Which?, said: "It's beyond belief that customers have experienced more problems as a result of yet another IT glitch from TSB, hot on the heels of a damning report into the bank's system failure last year.</p>
      <p>"With banks increasingly trying to move customers online, these IT glitches are still far too common across the industry, and it's clear that people need access to cash as a back-up.</p>
      <p>"The next government should intervene with legislation that protects access to cash for as long as it is needed."</p>
      <p>It's the latest glitch to affect TSB, after a major IT meltdown last year left close to two million people locked out of their accounts. The problems also sparked an unprecedented wave of opportunistic fraud attacks on TSB customers.</p>
      <p>The debacle led to former TSB boss Paul Pester stepping down.</p>
      <p>New chief executive Debbie Crosbie is due to update on her strategy overhaul at TSB on November 25.</p>
