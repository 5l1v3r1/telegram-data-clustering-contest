        <b>Why BAPE? What is the connection between Pagani and a streetwear brand?</b>
      </p>
      <p>BAPE is a brand that is a brand that is known all around the world, with a rich history much like Pagani. Both BAPE and Pagani are connected by the pursuit for good aesthetic design and a passion for our respective fields. Most of all we both aim to create something with an “emotion” that connects people. All of these aspects really pushed me to pursue this collaboration.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What is the main goal of this collaboration with BAPE?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pagani is a luxury car manufacturer that makes very very expensive, in one year only 40 or 50 people can become owners of our car. With this collaboration, more people around the world can become part of the Pagani brand.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How did this collaboration with BAPE come about?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I come to Asia two or three times a year, each trip I make sure to stop by Japan at least once. So, I have been aware of BAPE for a while now but only after learning about the history of the brand and the significance of the motifs associated did I become really interested. At first, I thought the BAPE was for a younger generation but meeting some of my clients overseas I noticed in their off time they were wearing BAPE. Finally, when we came together I really noticed a great synergy between our brands despite being in such different fields.</p>
