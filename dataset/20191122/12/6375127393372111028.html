      <h3>THE House Opposition bloc is for a total ban on Philippine Online Gaming Operations (POGO) if the government cannot tax the firms properly.</h3>
      <p>Minority Leader Bienvenido Abante said the government should follow Cambodia which banned  Chinese online gaming activities due to failure to pay the right revenue obligations.</p>
      <p>The House Minority bloc supports the measure passed in the House Committee on Ways and Means taxing the POGOs.</p>
      <p>“Hindi naman po pwede na dito sila mag-ooperate at di natin sila ita-tax o wala tayong kikitain sa pag-operate nila sa  Pilipinas. Render unto the Filipino people that which belongs to the Filipino people, and unto foreign(ers) that which belongs to foreign entities,” Abante said.</p>
      <p>Other members of the opposition — Probinsiyano Ako Jose “Bonito” Singson and Bayan Muna Rep. Carlo Isagani Zarate —  expressed strong support for the proposal of imposing proper taxes on POGOs.</p>
      <p>Singson lamented that out of 61 POGOs in the country, only 10 were given franchise and are being taxed.</p>
      <p>“Hindi properly implemented ang tax charges or baka nga may corruption, we should look into this,” Singson said.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the committee approved the 5 percent franchise tax on gross winnings of POGOs licensed by Philippine Gaming Corp. (PAGCOR). It also approved .25 percent withholding tax with minimum threshold of P600,000 per annum for the Chinese workers.</p>
