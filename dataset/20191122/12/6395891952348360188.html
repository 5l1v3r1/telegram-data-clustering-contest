      <p><b>MADRID (AP)</b> - A Spanish judge is recommending that Syrian ex-Vice President Rifaat Assad, the exiled uncle of Bashar Assad, and 13 others be put on trial i on charges of criminal organization and money laundering.</p>
      <p>Judge José de la Mata alleges that Rifaat Assad and the others, including eight sons, have laundered money taken out of Syria in several European countries since the 1980s.</p>
      <p>The court alleges they laundered around 600 million euros ($664 million) in Spain through real estate purchases. The 14 weren't immediately available for comment.</p>
      <p>The judge in 2017 ordered the seizure of more than 500 properties belonging to Assad and his relatives.</p>
      <p>Rifaat Assad, thought to live in France, fled Syria in 1984.</p>
      <p>De la Mato has asked prosecutors to decide if Spain should proceed with the case.</p>
