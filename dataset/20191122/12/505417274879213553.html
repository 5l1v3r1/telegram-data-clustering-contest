        <b>Alby Mathewson will make his <a href="https://punditarena.com/rugby/kennedymarisa760/larkham-praises-mathewson-munster/">final appearance</a> for Munster from the bench in their second-round Champions Cup clash with Racing 92 in Thomond Park on Saturday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>JJ Hanrahan returns to the side in place of Tyler Bleyendaal who reported stiffness this week and was unavailable for selection.</p>
      <p>He is one of three changes to the Munster side who recorded a bonus-point win over Ospreys last week with Tadhg Beirne and Jack O’Donoghue also named in the starting XV.</p>

      <p>Mike Haley starts at full-back with Andrew Conway and Keith Earls on either flank. Rory Scannell and Chris Farrell continue their centre partnership with Conor Murray and Hanrahan in the half-backs.</p>
      <p>Last week’s Man of the Match Jeremy Loughman, Niall Scannell and John Ryan pack down in the front row.</p>
      <p>Beirne partners Jean Kleyn in the engine room with O’Donoghue named in a back row that also includes captain Peter O’Mahony and CJ Stander.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, former Munster players Simon Zebo and Donnacha Ryan have been named in the Racing 92 side for the trip to Limerick.</p>

      <p>Connacht are boosted by the return of international lock Quinn Roux who will captain the side in the absence of Jarrad Butler. Roux will line up alongside Ultan Dillane in the second row after the latter came through the Montpellier game unscathed following a recent back injury.</p>

      <p>In the back row, the versatile Eoghan Masterson comes in at blindside with Colby Fainga’a at openside and Robin Copeland starting again at number 8.</p>
      <p>There is a reshuffle in the backline, with Matt Healy at full back in a back three that sees Kyle Godwin and John Porch on the wings, while Tom Farrell comes into the midfield alongside Tom Daly.</p>
