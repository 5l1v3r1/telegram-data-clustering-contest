      <p><b>PHILADELPHIAÂ (AP)</b> - A former campus minister at Villanova University who admitted possessing child pornography has been sentenced to nearly seven years in prison.</p>
      <p>Timothy O'Connell must also serve 10 years of supervised release once he's freed from prison. The 52-year-old Drexel Hill resident had pleaded guilty in June to obtaining images that depicted the sexual abuse and exploitation of pre-pubescent children.</p>
      <p>One of the victims was a 2-year-old child identified by the FBI in another investigation.</p>
      <p>O'Connell is the former associate director of campus ministry at Villanova. Federal prosecutors say the case is particularly disturbing because O'Connell was a spiritual leader who was trusted on campus.</p>
      <p>Before receiving a 78-month sentence Thursday, O'Connell told the judge "I'm disgusted by my behavior."</p>
