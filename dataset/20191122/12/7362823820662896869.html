      <p>A 23-year-old man from Northern Ireland has become the latest person to be arrested following the grim <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-police-truck-bodies-england-belgium">discovery of dozens of bodies</a> inside a refrigerated container truck in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom">Britain</a>.</p>
      <p>Essex Police say the man was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/crime">taken into custody</a> Friday along a highway northwest of London on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration.</p>
      <p>The bodies of 31 men and eight women – all from Vietnam -- <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/british-police-formally-identify-all-39-bodies-found-inside-truck">were found</a> Oct. 23 in the English town of Grays. Police said the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/victims-england-truck-vietnam-teenagers">victims were aged 15 to 44</a> and are believed to have paid human traffickers for their clandestine transit into England.</p>
