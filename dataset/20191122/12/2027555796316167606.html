      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:12:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Most shops and other business establishments in Kashmir were closed on Friday, the third consecutive day of a Valley-wide shutdown following a brief semblance of normalcy.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, posters warning shopkeepers and public transport operators appeared at several places in the city and elsewhere in the Valley, officials said.</p>
      <p>Main markets in the city and most other areas in the Valley were shut and shops did not open even for a few hours in the morning as they had been doing for the last few weeks. Public transport was also largely off the roads, officials said.Â </p>
