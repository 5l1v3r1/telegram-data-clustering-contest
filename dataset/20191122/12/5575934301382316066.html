      <p>Travis Kalanick is cashing in from the company he started.</p>
      <p><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/uber-stock">Uber’s</a> cofounder, who no longer works at the company, sold off $US1.5 billion worth of the company’s stock since the post-IPO lockup at the start of the November, and he offloaded over half a billion dollars in just three days, according to SEC filings.</p>
      <p>Between, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000156218019005636/xslF345X03/primarydocument.xml">November 19 and 21</a>, Kalanick sold roughly more than 20.4 million shares at an average of $US28.07 per share, coming to about $US578 million, adding to the series <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/travis-kalanick-sells-another-171-million-of-uber-stock-2019-11-1028701056">of offloads Kalanick made since November 6</a>.</p>
      <p>Kalanick still holds about 45 million shares of Uber still and is worth about $US3.3 billion according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-22/kalanick-sells-almost-1-5-billion-of-uber-in-weeks-after-lockup">Bloomberg</a>.</p>
      <p>“While it is usual to see directors with such a high value holding selling regularly, Kalanick’s sales are unusually high,” Michael Tindale said to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-22/kalanick-sells-almost-1-5-billion-of-uber-in-weeks-after-lockup">Bloomberg</a>, who is the CEO of Smart Insider, a firm that “tracks and analyses share transactions by directors and senior managers.”</p>
      <p>Kalanick’s sales underline the fact the Uber’s co-founder is focusing on other ventures, such as his startup CloudKitchens – a firm that sources rental space to be turned into kitchens for delivery-only restaurants.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/uber-travis-kalanick-saudi-arabia-funding-cloud-kitchens-delivery-2019-11">CloudKitchens got major backing</a> from Saudi Arabia at the start of the year.</p>
      <p>However, while Kalanick is selling off, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/dara-khosrowshahi-spends-7-million-on-shares-amid-kalanick-sales-2019-11-1028709211">Uber’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi is scooping up more stock.</a> SEC filings show that Khosrowshahi spent $US6.7 million on shares of the ride-hailing firm.</p>
      <p>According to analyst Mark Mahaney from RBC, Khosrowshahi is <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/uber-stock-should-be-added-to-fang-group-analyst-says-2019-11-1028705089">making the right move</a>.</p>
      <p>“You get the path to profitability working, this stock, which is dislocated now, can be a dramatic outperformer over the next three to five years,” Mahaney has said.</p>
      <p>Since the going public in May, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/uber-stock">Uber’s stock</a> has fallen 29%.</p>
