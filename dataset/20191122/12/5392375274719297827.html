      <p>OnePlus 7 Pro ‘s Audio Reviewed on DxOMark, Brings a Solid Performance<br/>2.8 (55%) 4 votes</p>
      <p>France-based website renown for its camera ratings – <a href="https://www.dxomark.com/">DxOMark</a> – just released a review of the OnePlus 7 Pro. This time it isn’t about the camera, which had already been<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/?s=oneplus+dxomark"> rated</a> back at launch. Instead, today we’ll be having a look at the audio skills of the handset.</p>
      <h3>OnePlus 7 Pro’s Audio Reviewed on DxOMark, Brings a Solid Performance</h3>

      <p>For those who aren’t aware, “DxOMark Audio tests” are the latest addition to the portfolio of hardware tested by the DxOMark team. The review procedure consists in a variety of objective tests and more than 20 hours of perceptual evaluation under controlled lab conditions. This is all done using the device’s built-in hardware and default apps, both for playback and recording. So no additional hardware or software is present.</p>
      <p>After going through this rating procedure, the OnePlus 7 Pro came out with a score of 65. This is a score in line with other flagship phones currently on the market. These include the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ at 66 points, the Galaxy S10+ at 65 and the latest Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max at 71.</p>

      <p>So, according to DxOMark, the OnePlus 7 Pro behaved very well. More specifically, in the playback tests, the smartphone did well in overall playback performance with relatively few artifacts. Plus the speaker’s smart positioning appears to avoid hand occlusions.</p>
      <p>While on the negative side we have a lack of bass which affects timbre and dynamics. The device also has an asymmetric speaker placement that affects spatial performance; stereo sound won’t be as immersive.</p>

      <p>As far as recording is concerned, the OnePlus 7 Pro showed off a decent recording performance and the ability to record loud sounds without distortion. The handset doesn’t do very good in recording voice though, which seem to have a metallic sound. There’s also a too aggressive compression algorithm that lowers voice quality and, last but not least, there’s too much distortion when recording with a noisy background.</p>
