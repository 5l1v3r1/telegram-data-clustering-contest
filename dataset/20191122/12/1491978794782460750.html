      <h1>Chess: Magnus Carlsen ‘won’t count’ Norway league games in record streak</h1>

        <i>World champion calls them ‘Tivi-esque’ in dig at Sergei Tiviakov, rival claimant to the longest run in classical without defeat</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/magnus-carlsen">Magnus Carlsen</a> is aiming for a record 111-game unbeaten streak but the world champion has just made it harder for himself by announcing that he will exclude his Norwegian league games from his total.</p>
      <p>The No 1 thought he had established a new record when he surpassed Ding Liren’s 100-game mark against elite opposition but then the Russian-Dutch GM Sergei Tiviakov volubly promoted his own 110-game unbeaten run achieved in 2004-05 against weaker opponents. Tiviakov attributes his defensive skills to studying the games of the legendary “Iron Tigran” Petrosian, who rarely lost.</p>
      <p>Carlsen’s manager described Tiviakov as a middleweight fighting a super-heavyweight while Carlsen himself said his <a href="https://lichess.org/JowNtGwQ#0">two Norwegian League wins</a> against opponents rated more than <a href="https://lichess.org/G7mhudfs">500 points lower</a> were“Tivi-esque”. He is a hard self-critic. Both games are impressive and instructive lessons on how to outplay a weaker opponent who defends passively.</p>
      <p>Tiviakov’s opponents included only a handful of sub-2200s, but he was meeting 2500s and 2600s where Carlsen’s diet has been mainly 2700s. Probably fewer than 20% of Tiviakov’s opponents ranked among the world top 100.</p>
      <p>Still Carlsen is now counting his total as 101 rather than 103, so he needs to stay unbeaten in his four classical games in the Grand Tour semi-final and final at London Olympia on 2-8 December and his first six rounds at Tata Steel Wijk aan Zee in January to reach his 111 target. Spectator tickets for Olympia are <a href="https://www.londonchessclassic.com/">available online</a>.</p>
      <p>Carlsen’s three rivals in London will be settled by the results of the Grand Tour Kolkata rapid and blitz from Friday until next Tuesday, which can be watched free and live <a href="https://grandchesstour.org/2019-grand-chess-tour/2019-tour-standings">online</a>.</p>
      <p>Carlsen himself will also be competing in Kolkata, although with less pressure than usual. He is already qualified for the London finals, while speed games do not count towards his classical record. Ding Liren and Levon Aronian are almost sure to qualify, while Vishy Anand needs to finish sixth or better to qualify ahead of Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, who is not playing in Kolkata.</p>
      <p>Carlsen drew in Friday’s opening round, then defeated Russia’s No 1, Ian Nepomniachtchi, <a href="https://www.chessbomb.com/arena/2019-grand-chess-tour-tata-steel/02-Carlsen_Magnus-Nepomniachtchi_Ian">in round two</a> and Aronian, who missed a late draw by 49 Nf4+!, <a href="https://www.chessbomb.com/arena/2019-grand-chess-tour-tata-steel/03-Aronian_Levon-Carlsen_Magnus">in round three</a>. The world champion is the clear leader after the first day with 2.5/3.</p>
      <p>Gawain Jones completed a unique haul of two golds, three silvers and a bronze medal in major competitions during a single year when the Sheffield grandmaster, who turns 32 next month, won both a team gold and an individual board five gold with 5/6 at the European Club Cup in Montenegro.</p>

      <p>Earlier Jones won team and individual silvers for England at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/14/chess-england-win-first-medal-for-22-years">world teams</a> in Kazakhstan and team bronze and individual silver for England at the European teams in Georgia.</p>
      <p>None of the UK’s top 4NCL clubs sent teams to Montenegro, so Jones and Michael Adams both played in the Eurocup as part of a polyglot squad for Padova of Italy, the No 4 seeds.</p>
      <p>Padova won all their seven matches, and beat the top seeds from Macedonia in the final round. Jones’s most <a href="https://www.chessbomb.com/arena/2019-european-club-cup/05-Buksa_Nataliya-Jones_Gawain_C_B">eye-catching win</a> came earlier when his opponent opted for a sortie on move 20 with the queen, which was then trapped just four moves later.</p>
      <p>The odd background to this historic achievement is that overall 2019 has been an uneven year for the Yorkshireman, who struggled to hold his own at the Isle of Man Grand Swiss in October.</p>
      <p>For Adams, though, gold in Montenegro was the climax of a strong recovery after the Cornishman, 48 last Sunday, had dropped down the ratings. Now he has regained both <a href="https://2700chess.com/?per-page=100">a 2700 rating</a> and the England No 1 spot.</p>
