      <h1>Man United without McTominay for ‘a couple of weeks’, Solskjaer confirms</h1>

        <b>Paul Pogba is still on the sidelines, with Nemanja Matic yet to regain full fitness, and Scott McTominay will miss Man United’s next games.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scott McTominay has compounded Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s midfield injury woes as Manchester United prepare to travel to Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>Scotland international McTominay has become a consistent and influential performer for Solskjaer this season, but his manager told a pre-match news conference he will be out for around two more weeks with an ankle problem sustained during the closing stages of the 3-1 Premier League win over Brighton and Hove Albion.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old, who scored in that victory, joins Paul Pogba, the victim of a more serious ankle injury, on the sidelines. Nemanja Matic has only recently stepped up his return to training alongside defensive duo Axel Tuanzebe (hip) and Luke Shaw (hamstring).</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Solskjaer also has a fresh concern in that department, as Marcos Rojo rehabilitates from a muscular issue on a similar timeframe to McTominay.</p>
      <p>“Scotty hurt his ankle so he’ll be out for a couple of weeks I reckon,” the Red Devils boss said.</p>
      <p>“He won’t be ready for this week. We’ve lost Rojo, he’s injured. Paul’s still injured. But we’ve got Axel, Luke and Nemanja back in training.</p>
      <p>“We’re getting numbers back. Maybe not match fit – Axel and Luke have been out for a long time, Nemanja’s been out but numbers-wise in training we’re looking stronger.</p>
      <p>“Rojo got a muscle injury in training that he’s been struggling with. He’s been trying to get back but he’s not ready yet.</p>
      <p>“He had to pull out of the internationals [with Argentina]. He was playing on with some discomfort towards the end of that run [before the international break]. Maybe a couple of weeks.”</p>

      <p>Solskjaer praised McTominay’s emergence this term, grabbing his opportunity as other more illustrious names have underwhelmed.</p>
      <p>“Scotty has performed really well this season. Finally he’s nailed a position down for himself,” he said.</p>
      <p>“He’s played regularly, he’s been a running midfielder before, he’s played centre-back, he’s played everywhere. He was a striker when he was a kid.</p>
      <p>“But now he’s learning the game and his improvement has been great to see. We’re going to miss him – Sheffield United, set plays, balls in the box. Of course, Scotty is going to be a little bit of a miss.”</p>
      <p>Sheffield United are fifth in the table, eight points shy of Manchester City in fourth and one ahead of seventh-placed Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Indeed, four points cover all teams from the Blades down to West Ham in 16th.</p>
      <p>“We’ve still got to keep looking up the table. It’s so close, but a big gap up to the top four,” Solskjaer added.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got City next month. We’ve got a chance to claw some points back. We know we’re getting players back and improving as a team, so hopefully, yeah, we can challenge when it comes towards the end.</p>
      <p>“I’ve seen Marcus [Rashford] talk about it this week, it’s not just about getting into the top four, but that’s a little bit of a goal for us, of course.”</p>
