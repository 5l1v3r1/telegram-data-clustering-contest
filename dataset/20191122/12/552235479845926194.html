      <p>A brute who attacked his partner twice when she was pregnant has been jailed for nearly three years.</p>
      <p>Steffanie Grady was first assaulted by Ian Murphy on New Year’s Day 2008, but she was so scared of him that she didn’t report his violence until ten years later.</p>
      <p>Murphy, 38, of Redwood Crescent, Viewpark, was sentenced at Hamilton Sheriff Court last Thursday.</p>
      <p>He admitted four charges of assaulting Ms Grady between 2008 and 2017.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Guy, prosecuting, said the first attack happened after a Hogmanay celebration.</p>
      <p>Murphy became angry because his partner stayed out later.</p>
      <p>Ms Guy told the court: “As soon as she got home, the accused went mad.</p>
      <p>“It was the first time she had seen him acting like this and she was scared.</p>
      <p>“He kept shouting and bawling at her and slapped her forcefully across the face. He then dragged her into the living room where he continued to strike her to the head.”</p>
      <p>Ms Grady was treated for a perforated eardrum, cuts and bruises, including a black eye.</p>
      <p>At hospital she found out she was pregnant and told Murphy who promised he would never hit her again.</p>
      <p>That promise was broken in August 2008 when she was heavily pregnant.</p>
      <p>Six days before she was due to give birth, Murphy returned home drunk and became aggressive.</p>
      <p>He kicked Ms Grady, causing her to fall head first down the stairs.</p>
      <p>Ms Guy said she had “obvious concerns” for her unborn baby, but hospital staff reassured her the baby was fine.</p>
      <p>Afraid of repercussions from Murphy, she told nurses she had fallen by accident.</p>
      <p>Ms Guy also told the court of an occasion in January 2015 when Murphy lost his temper, pulled his partner from a chair and dragged her across the room “in full view of a witness”.</p>
      <p>Then, in December 2017, Ms Grady went to a work’s Christmas party and when she got home Murphy started shouting at her for staying out late.</p>
      <p>Ms Guy said: “The accused grabbed her by the throat, restricting her breathing.</p>
      <p>“He then shook her and pushed her, causing her to fall back and strike her head off a bannister.</p>
      <p>“This was witnessed by a child.</p>
      <p>“Ms Grady was bleeding profusely from a cut to the back of the head and the accused was shouting about blood on the carpet.</p>
      <p>“He went with her to hospital. Staff asked her if he was responsible for her injury, but she was so scared she said she had simply fallen.</p>
      <p>“The wound required four stitches and will likely result in scarring.”</p>
      <p>Eventually Ms Grady confided to a work colleague that Murphy had attacked her.</p>
      <p>She went to the police in the summer of last year.</p>
      <p>Ms Guy added: “She said she felt in constant fear and had no way to escape. She had been terrified to tell anyone because it would make things worse.</p>
      <p>“At one point she took an overdose but, fortunately, did not require hospital treatment.</p>
      <p>“In March last year Ms Grady told Murphy their relationship was over. He pleaded with her, promising he would change and nothing further would happen.”</p>
      <p>Defence agent Laura Kiernan said Murphy was “ashamed” of his behaviour, but suggested he could be spared a jail sentence.</p>
      <p>She said: “I don’t want to take away from the serious nature of the charges, but a supervision order would allow social workers to get to the crux of his issues.</p>
      <p>“This would benefit him and the wider community.”</p>
      <p>However, Sheriff Thomas Millar said each of the four charges was serious enough on is own to merit a prison sentence.</p>
      <p>He jailed Murphy for a total of 34 months.</p>
