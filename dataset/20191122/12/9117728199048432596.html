        <b>Sam Bird has won the first race of Formula E season six in Saudi Arabia with a terrific drive from fifth on the grid. Mercedes' EQ FE had a superb start to life in the all-electric series as they qualified second and third with Stoffel Vandoorne and Nyck De Vries, with Vandoorne coming home third for a debut podium.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Britain's Alexander Sims was on pole and led from the start, but was pushed wide by Belgian Vandoorne, allowing Bird through to take his ninth Formula E win, keeping up his streak of taking a victory in every season.</p>

      <p>Andre Lotterer came home second on Porsche's debut, ahead of Vandoorne, with his Mercedes teammate De Vries slipping back to sixth. Sims fell down to eighth before the chequered flag.</p>
      <p>It was a nightmare start to the season for reigning two-time champion Jean-Eric Vergne, who was forced to retire from the race.</p>
