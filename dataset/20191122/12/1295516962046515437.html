      <h1>REPORT: Robert Downey Jr. NOT Returning as Iron Man for What If? Series</h1>

      <p>Robert Downey Jr. may not be returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Tony Stark/Iron Man after all.</p>
      <p>Last week <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i> star Jeff Goldblum revealed that <a href="https://www.cbr.com/what-if-goldblum-confirms-robert-downey-iron-man/">Downey would return as the Armored Avenger</a> for a vocal role on the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/what-if-tv/">What If?</a> Disney+ animated series. Now, a source for <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/robert-downey-jr-iron-man-in-what-if/">The Wrap</a> states Goldblum misspoke, and there are no plans for Downey to voice Tony Stark for the upcoming streaming series.</p>

      <p>When Goldblum was asked if he'd return as Grandmaster in <i>Thor: Love and Thunder</i>, the actor revealed that he went to Disney Studios to record for <i>What If...? </i>"This episode included the Grandmaster and Iron Man," Goldblum said. "So Robert Downey [Jr.] will do a voice in that. And Korg, Taika Waititi, had already recorded his voice for that."</p>

      <p>Iron Man sacrificed himself to stop the Mad Titan Thanos in the climactic battle in <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>. While it remains unlikely Downey would return for an acting role in the MCU, many believe a small speaking role in a project like <i>What If?</i> is possible, especially since it's been announced that actors like <a href="https://screenrant.com/zombie-captain-america-winter-soldier-scene-marvel-what-if/">Hayley Atwell</a> will voice their MCU roles (Peggy Carter).</p>
      <p>Marvel Studios' first animated series, <i>What If...?</i>, will take audiences through the Multiverse to show off alternative versions of the MCU's colorful cast of characters. The show will consist of 23 episodes and will be available on Disney+ sometime in 2021.</p>
