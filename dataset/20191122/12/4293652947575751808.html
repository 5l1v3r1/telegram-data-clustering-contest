      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/teams/toronto-raptors/">Toronto Raptors</a> officially unveiled their new 2019-20 OVO City Edition jerseys on Friday.</p>
      <p>Design-wise, the jersey keeps with past OVO styles, incorporating the black-and-gold that is now readily associated with Drake and his accompanying OVO branding.</p>
      <p>This year’s version, however, also incorporates throwback elements from Toronto’s inaugural season.</p>
