      <h1>Klopp welcomes ‘desperate’ Mourinho back with joke about his punditry</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:21:20+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp was immediately asked about Jose Mourinho’s Spurs appointment today – and couldn’t help but make a joke about it!</p>
      <p>In typical style of Liverpool’s manager, Klopp told the listening journalists that <i>‘you could see he was desperate when he was not in work!’</i> in reference to Mourinho’s passionate punditry that went viral so many times over the first few months of the season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dave Maddock of the Mirror tweeted Klopp’s comment as he said it:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Klopp starts press conf with a huge grin when Jose Mourinho is mentioned: "Welcome back Jose…you could see he was desperate when he was not in (work)!" <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LFC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LFC<br/></a>— David Maddock (@MaddockMirror) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaddockMirror/status/1197840026094231554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>We actually loved Mourinho the pundit, as he showed what an intelligent, articulate and analytical person he is.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/2019/11/10/video-mourinho-makes-fool-of-kompany-you-are-the-champions-of-england-but-they-are-the-champions-of-europe/">His shutting down of Vincent Kompany</a> before Liverpool 3-1 Manchester City was legendary, for example.</p>
      <p>But during his last two stints as a manager, at Chelsea the second time and Manchester United – he just seemed bitter, nasty and jealous.</p>
      <p>The atmosphere and manner he left both those clubs in was awful, so it remains to be seen if he’s learned his own lessons and improve Tottenham’s fortunes.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, they’re 20 points behind us in the table – so this season – we wouldn’t even consider Klopp and Mourinho rivals!</p>
