      </p>

      <p>They had downed drinks and enjoyed the festivities but when they returned to Campbell's flat violence erupted after they began 'bickering' on the way home.</p>
      <p>While her back was turned he smashed her head with a glass bottle from behind and then struck her again leaving her bleeding profusely.</p>
      <p>Miss Welsh, 45, fled the flat in East Kilbride, Lanarkshire, fearing for her life and began desperately trying to wake up neighbours in the early hours of Boxing Day last year.</p>
      <p>She was taken to hospital and treated for her injuries and police were called.</p>
      <p>A trial heard one neighbour thought there had been a murder because of the amount of blood in the close of the flats.</p>
      <p>Campbell, of East Kilbride, denied all wrongdoing and went on trial at Hamilton Sheriff Court.</p>
      <p>He told the trial that he had been 'asleep' and that Miss Welsh, who he had been in a relationship with for four years, had drunkenly fallen and injured herself.</p>
      <p>But a jury took less than an hour to find him guilty of assaulting her by majority and he was remanded in custody by Sheriff Daniel Kelly QC.</p>
      <p>Depute fiscal Jennifer McLaren had urged jurors to convict Campbell, who has previous convictions for domestic abuse, of the brutal unprovoked assault in December last year.</p>
      <p>She said: "You will remember the words of Tracey Welsh: 'I thought he was going to come out and finish whatever he had started'.</p>
      <p>"These words after he had smashed a glass bottle into her head, first when her back was turned and then again when she was facing him.</p>
      <p>"There are certain things in society that we refuse to tolerate and domestic abuse is one of those things.</p>
      <p>"In years gone by there was an attitude that what goes on behind closed doors should stay there but society and the criminal justice system has moved on since.</p>
      <p>"Offending is not less serious because it happens behind closed doors but made more serious by it happening behind closed doors with victims unwilling to tell what happened.</p>
      <p>"Miss Welsh told you what happened to her, she told the police and then she came to court and told you.</p>
      <p>"During this attack, Mr Campbell was keen to keep this behind closed doors but what she told you was the truth and you should have no doubt about that.</p>
      <p>"If she had tripped and fallen then why would she phone the police and why would she wake the entire close up if this assault had not taken place?</p>
      <p>"You should have absolutely no reasonable doubt about Mr Campbell's guilt."</p>
      <p>Stephen McQuillan, defending, said his client should be cleared due to lack of evidence against him.</p>
      <p>He added: "Her evidence should leave you with a reasonable doubt. "He does not know what happened to her because he woke up and was looking for her, she was a missing person.</p>
      <p>"When he found her she accused him and he panicked and went away and that is his position.</p>
      <p>"She says she was hit by Mr Campbell and he says he did not, that is what this case comes down to and I say the Crown case does not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty of anything."</p>
      <p>Sheriff Kelly told Campbell: "I'm sure you're under no illusions that it is a serious charge that you face for a serious assault on Miss Welsh.</p>
      <p>"It was not as if you were coming before the court without previous convictions and you have assaulted Miss Welsh and someone else in a domestic setting before."</p>
      <p>Campbell will be sentenced next month.</p>
