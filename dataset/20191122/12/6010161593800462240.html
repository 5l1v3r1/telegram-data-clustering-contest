      <h1>State of Decay 2 is coming to Steam in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:46:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:46</time> by <a rel="author">Sherif Saed</a></address>
      <p>State of Decay 2 is finally coming to Steam, though not until 2020.</p>
      <p><b>State of Decay 2</b> is on its way to Steam, as the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/495420/State_Of_Decay_2/">Steam page is now live</a>. Spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/RobotBrush">lashman</a>, the page strangely has an April 1, 2022 release date.</p>
      <p>As you’ll quickly find, however, this date isn’t actually accurate. In the ‘About This Game’ section on the same page, you can see developer Undead Labs confirms the game is coming to Steam in early 2020.</p>
      <p>Still, though, the weirdly specific release date at the top is amusing. There’s no mention of DLC – and State of Decay 2 has had plenty, so this may not be a complete edition-style version. As with other Xbox Game Studios titles, State of Decay 2 will support cross-play with Xbox One/Windows 10.</p>
      <p>State of Decay 2 was first released in May last year and had <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2018/06/05/state-decay-2-player-numbers/">a fairly successful launch</a> and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2018/05/17/state-of-decay-2-reviews-pc-xbox-one/">a decent critical reception</a>.</p>
