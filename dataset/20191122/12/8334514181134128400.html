      <p>(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/TSLA.O">TSLA.O</a>) debuted its electric pickup truck Cybertruck on Thursday, joining a list of automakers and start-ups that have been working on electrifying pickup trucks - the heart of the Detroit automakers’ profits.</p>

      <p>The Cybertruck, which starts at $39,900, will offer other versions priced at $49,900 and $69,900, with the most expensive offering a range of more than 500 miles.</p>
      <p>The electric pickup, which can accelerate from 0-60 miles an hour in 2.9 seconds, is expected to go in production around late 2021.</p>
      <p>Industry tracking firm HIS Markit estimates the electric truck segment - both full- and mid-sized models - is expected to sell about 75,000 vehicles in 2026, compared with 3 million light trucks overall. Tesla’s truck is not part of that estimate given its uncertain availability.</p>
      <p>Here is a list of upcoming electric pickup trucks from several automakers:</p>
      <p>General Motors Co (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/GM.N">GM.N</a>)</p>
      <p>The No.1 U.S. automaker’s first electric pickup truck model will go on sale in the fall of 2021, the company’s top executive said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The company has so far given few details on its planned line of electric pickup trucks.</p>
      <p>The company has said it plans to invest $8 billion to develop electric and self-driving vehicles and launch 20 new EVs globally by 2023.</p>
      <p>GM plans to build a family of premium electric pickup trucks and SUVs, beginning with an electric pickup - possibly under the Hummer brand.</p>
      <p>Ford Motor Co (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/F.N">F.N</a>)</p>
      <p>Ford’s F-150 pickup was one of the best-selling vehicles in the United States in 2018. The No. 2 U.S. automaker is designing electric pickup trucks based on the F-series and plans to invest $11.5 billion to electrify its vehicles by 2022, including 16 fully electric models.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Reuters in September, Ford Chairman Bill Ford hinted that the truck could have load-carrying space under the hood in addition to the traditional bed in the back. Ford will also launch its electric sports utility vehicle called “Mustang Mach-E” next year, the reservations for which is open with a re-fundable deposit of $500.</p>
      <p>Rivian Automotive LLC</p>
      <p>The Michigan-based manufacturer of electric adventure vehicle has backing from Ford and Amazon.com Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/AMZN.O">AMZN.O</a>), and it is working on an all-electric pickup truck “R1T” with up to 750 horsepower and a range of over 400 miles.</p>
      <p>R1T will have a towing capacity of 11,000 lbs, with a starting price of $69,000. The model is due in fall 2020. The start-up is also working on an all-electric SUV “R1S” with similar specs.</p>
      <p>Ford in April said it will invest $500 million in Rivian and use its “skateboard” - a chassis that bundles electric motor, batteries and controls - to build a new vehicle for North America. The announcement came after Amazon said in February that it would lead a $700 million investment in Rivian.</p>
      <p>Bollinger Motors</p>
      <p>The Detroit-based startup is working on its all-electric pickup truck “Bollinger B2” that will have a 614 horsepower engine and a full aluminum body. The Verge reported last month that the vehicle will have a starting price of $125,000.</p>
      <p>Atlis Motor Vehicles</p>
      <p>The U.S.-based electric vehicle start-up joins the race for electrifying pickup trucks with its “Atlis XT” model, which the company says will charge in 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>Atlis XT will ditch conventional wing mirrors for side cameras and direct the feed to two screens on either side of the steering wheel. The model will start from $45,000 and is expected to roll out in 2020.</p>
      <p>(This story corrects paragraph 2 and table to say Cybertruck’s starting price is $39,900, not $39,000)</p>
