      <p>However, she received an unpleasant shock in return and shared her story on a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ORIGINAL.KRT.MY/posts/543784039677603">Facebook page</a> that was really heart-wrenching. “I have been married for three years and have a five-month-old baby. I was excitedly waiting for my husband to come back from work as I had a surprise for him. I had bought tickets for Malaysia versus Indonesia match for two people.”</p>
      <p>She said that she messaged him asking him to come back early, saying that she had a surprise waiting for him. But he replied to her, saying that he had a lot of work and needed to work overtime. “I didn’t mind, as he was out working to support the family, so I gave the tickets to my brothers. So, I stayed home alone looking after the baby when suddenly, my friend sent me an Instagram direct message. <b>It was a screenshot of a photo of my husband with another woman and both of them were happily watching the football match.”</b></p>

      <p>The poor, betrayed wife stalked the other woman’s Instagram profile and realised that her husband was cheating on her. She said that she even saw the woman, who was her actually her husband’s ex, posting photos of her dates with her husband and one of those times was when he had lied to her that he needed to work overtime.</p>
      <p>“They look very cosy and intimate together on her Instagram photos. <b>I don’t know how long they have been together, but they even checked into a hotel together.</b> I don’t know what have I done wrong that he would cheat on me. Maybe I’m not as pretty as her. But it’s okay my husband, I will defend our marriage as long as I am able to.”</p>

      <p><b>As if it wasn’t enough that her husband was cheating on her, she revealed that she was suffering from stage 3 uterus cancer and dying.</b> <i>Oh no!</i> She added that she knows her husband is on the Facebook page, so he might have seen her confession. “When I’m gone, please take care of our baby. That woman can also become our baby’s stepmother. I only wanted to spend time with you before I’m gone. Thanks for taking care of me.”</p>
      <p>She concluded her post saying that she wrote it not because she wanted sympathy, but she just wanted to advise everyone to treasure the people close to them. She said that one should never cheat as well, as all will be revealed sooner or later. <i>Which is true! </i>Netizens were heartbroken by her story and wished her well, saying that they would pray for her to make a full recovery.</p>
      <p>
        <i>We hope she makes a full recovery so she can take care of her beloved baby!</i>
