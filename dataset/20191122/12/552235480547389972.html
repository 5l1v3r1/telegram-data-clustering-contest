      <h1>Celtic captain Scott Brown is only interested in his ego and not Scotland’s progress- Hotline</h1>
      <h2>Gavin Berry takes your calls as Scott Brown's comments refusing to rule out a Scotland return have brought criticism.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:39:44+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:39</time> by <a rel="author">Sports Hotline, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sports-hotline/</a></address>
      <p>Scott Brown put the cat among the pigeons after refusing to rule out another <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> comeback with the nation just 180 minutes away from qualifying for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>But Hotline callers have told national team boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> in no uncertain terms that the Celtic captain shouldn’t be allowed to return to the squad.</p>
      <p>Brown will celebrate his 35th birthday just a couple of days after <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hampden-park">Hampden</a> hosts its final group game at next summer’s finals and a week before a last-16 tie comes to Glasgow.</p>
      <p>And, if Scotland can get past Israel at Hampden and Norway in Oslo next March, the former captain refused to rule out being a part of the Euro football extravaganza.</p>
      <p>Brown earned 55 caps for his country before calling it quits for a second time under Alex McLeish in February 2018, having initially ended his international career in August 2016 only to U-turn on that decision two months later to help Gordon Strachan.</p>
      <p>His last appearance was a 2-0 win over Malta at Hampden in the failed World Cup 2018 campaign but believes the rest during internatinal breaks has been crucial in maintaining his sparkling club form.</p>
      <p>But James Forsyth, Bellshill, said: “Scott Brown shouldn’t be allowed to come out of internatinal retirment if we qualify for the finals.</p>
      <p>“Where was he when we needed players and were getting thrashed?”</p>
      <p>Kenny Wilson, Moffat, said: “I’m a big Scott Brown fan but there’s absolutely no way he should be allowed back into the Scotland squad if we qualify for the Euros.”</p>

      <p>Alan Milligan emailed: “Scott Brown has no shame. He lets the other players do the spade work and thinks he can come back when there is a chance of a place in the finals. Unbelievable.”</p>
      <p>George Grant, Banff, said: “So Scott Brown is considering coming out of international retirement yet again.</p>
      <p>“He has walked way twice already and is only thinking about a return because we have a chance of reaching the finals.</p>
      <p>“Brown didn’t want to play through the qualifying group so he shouldn’t seen to play in the rest of the games.</p>
      <p>“He’s only interested in his ego and not the national team’s progress.</p>
      <p>“We have managed without him up until now so we don’t need him.”</p>
      <p>Davy Matson emailed: “So Scott Brown says he might return to the Scotland squad if we qualify for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>“We don’t need players who don’t want to play in the earlier games but want all the glory. Stick with the boys who get us there.”</p>
      <p>Jim Kerr, Renfrew, said: “It would be the wrong move for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-brown">Scott Brown</a> to return to the Scotland team.</p>
      <p>“He’s had his time and I’d love him to take the rest of the Celtic players out of the squad as well to give them a break.”</p>
      <p>George Grant, Banff, said: “So Scott Brown is considering coming out of international retirement yet again.</p>
      <p>“He has walked way twice already and is only thinking about a return because we have a chance of reaching the finals.</p>
      <p>“Brown didn’t want to play through the qualifying group so he shouldn’t seen to play in the rest of the games.</p>
      <p>“He’s only interested in his ego and not the national team’s progress.</p>
      <p>“We have managed without him up until now so we don’t need him.”</p>
      <p>Davy Matson emailed: “So Scott Brown says he might return to the Scotland squad if we qualify for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> .</p>
      <p>“We don’t need players who don’t want to play in the earlier games but want all the glory. Stick with the boys who get us there.”</p>
      <p>The picture is clearer for Scotland following the play-off draw in Nyon and Record Sport revealed a group containing France, Portugal and England could await if Clarke’s men are successful.</p>
      <p>But Alfie Mullin, London, said: “Let me ease everyone’s minds by reassuring them that we won’t face that nightmare scenario. “We won’t make it through the play-offs. We haven’t beaten any team of note for years and I don’t see this changing. The only thing like to change is the manager when he fails to negotiate the play-offs successfully.”</p>

      <p>Recent Scotland managers have found it difficult to find international class defenders and Andrew Considine has missed out on a call-up as he prepares to play his 500th game for Aberdeen against St Johnstone on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Arthur Wyllie, Aberdeen, said: “I can’t remember Andrew Considine ever having a poor game for Aberdeen. He is so consistent and usually brilliant.</p>
      <p>“There is only one thing missing - a Scotland cap. Why has such a dependable player never been capped for his country? He must be the best uncapped player in Scotland.</p>
      <p>“Come on Steve Clarke, please give him at least one cap which he thoroughly deserves even if it is in some meaningless friendly.”</p>
