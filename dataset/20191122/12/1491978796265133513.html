      <p>This undated shot of urban Blackburn, by the Guardian photographer Don McPhee, has a caption scrawled at the bottom: “Searching out the Asian vote in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackburn">Blackburn</a>.” In the 1970s, when McPhee joined the paper, community tensions increased and support grew for the far right after the arrival of a large number of Asian immigrants in northern England. McPhee, who was based in Manchester, became known for stories such as this, and his photographs frequently depicted contemporary social and political issues. The lone, slightly out of focus figure in the foreground has her head turned from McPhee’s lens, focusing the shot on the town behind.</p>
