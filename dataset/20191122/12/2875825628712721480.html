      <h2>Influencer James Kavanagh is acting as a designated driver this Christmas</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T12:55:16+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 12:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/edel-hughes/" target="_blank">Edel Hughes</a></address>
      <p>Coca-Cola is offering designated drivers free parking spots and two free Coca-Cola drinks on nights out over Christmas.</p>
      <p>The soft drink giant has teamed up with the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/road-safety-authority">Road Safety Authority</a> to encourage Irish people to stay sober so they can drive themselves and their pals home safely.</p>
      <p>And to make sure they can still enjoy the festive fun, designated drivers can get two free soft drinks from the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/coca-cola">Coca-Cola</a> HBC range throughout the month of December.</p>
      <p>Drivers simply need to make themselves known to bar staff at participating venues to get their free drinks.</p>
      <p>They can choose from a range of drinks including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Zero, Fanta, Sprite, Deep RiverRock, Fruice and Appletiser.</p>

      <p>In addition to this, Coca-Cola will also reward designated drivers by providing three allocated parking spots at the St Stephen’s Green Q-Park in Dublin and Victoria Square in Belfast each weekend in December.</p>
      <p>Designated drivers simply need to present themselves to security hubs at the Q-Park stations to benefit from free parking.</p>
      <p>Well-known influencer and TV presenter James Kavanagh has teamed up with Coca-Cola to promote the campaign.</p>
      <p>James revealed he will be acting as a designated driver for his friends over the Christmas period.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’m thrilled to be on board to help spread the word about the 2019 Coca-Cola Designated Driver campaign.</p>
      <p>"Anyone who knows me, knows that I live for Christmas nights out, but don’t always feel like drinking.</p>
      <p>"Thanks to both my newly acquired full drivers’ licence and Coca-Cola, this Christmas I’ll be able to buzz my mates to and from a night out and get my fave Coca-Cola drinks for free – it’s a no-brainer!”</p>

      <p>Miles Karemacher, Coca-Cola HBC Ireland and Northern Ireland’s General Manager said: “At Coca-Cola HBC, we are passionate about playing a value-adding role in communities across the island.</p>
      <p>"For 15 years, we have taken immense pride in supporting and celebrating designated drivers throughout the Christmas season, and this year will be no different."</p>
      <p>Road Safety Authority CEO Moyagh Murdock said:“Drink driving is still a factor in three-quarters of road deaths between the hours of 10pm and 6am.</p>
      <p>"That’s why, unfortunately, initiatives like Coca-Cola’s Designated Driver campaign are still required.</p>

      <p>"The designated driver campaign celebrates and rewards responsible, sober drivers, but most importantly it reinforces the importance of keeping our roads alcohol-free at this high-risk time of year.</p>
      <p>"Take precautions on the roads this Christmas, and never, ever drink and drive.”<anchor name="m_5331175765890746159__Hlk24708656"/></p>
