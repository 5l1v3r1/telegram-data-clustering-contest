      <p>A bill to remove marijuana from U.S. federal controlled substances lists, expunge federal convictions and arrests, and allocate resources to communities that have suffered under the U.S. government’s <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/10/the-war-on-drugs-is-a-war-on-the-climate">war on drugs</a> passed 24-10 in the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-judiciary-passes-bill-legalize-marijuana-federal-level/story?id=67174950">ABC News reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Passing a bill through committee is just one step on the road towards a piece of legislation becoming law. <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/house-judiciary-commitee-marijuana-legalization-more-act-915369/">Rolling Stone reported</a> that it must pass through several other House committees, and the Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to move on it. But the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2019 (MORE Act) is the first marijuana-legalisation bill to ever pass committee stage in the federal legislature.</p>
      <p>In addition to the aforementioned provisions, the MORE Act would also create a U.S. Cannabis Justice Office and levy a five per cent tax on the sale of marijuana in states which have already legalised the drug. The bill would still leave it <a href="https://gizmodo.com/people-in-red-and-blue-states-may-use-weed-very-differe-1831983454">up to individual states</a> as to whether to remove their own penalties against marijuana—federal authorities have <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/8/20/17938372/marijuana-legalization-federal-prohibition-drug-scheduling-system">already loosened enforcement</a> in those states.</p>
      <p>Polls have shown overwhelming public support for ditching weed prohibition. Gallup <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/267698/support-legal-marijuana-steady-past-year.aspx">recently released a report</a> finding that support for legalization held steady at 66 per cent in 2018 and 2019. Meanwhile, the supposed scientific case for marijuana criminalization, which largely relies on the argument that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/04/26/is-marijuana-a-gateway-drug/marijuana-has-proven-to-be-a-gateway-drug">weed is a “gateway drug”</a> that leads users down the path to riskier drugs like meth or heroin, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/4/29/11528410/cannabis-gateway-drug-theory">is falling apart</a> even as weed convictions have helped <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/opinion/lifers/2019/09/04/pot-weed-war-marijuana-prison-life-sentence-lifers/2057276001/">explode U.S. prison populations</a>.</p>
      <p>Marijuana is currently listed as Schedule I by the U.S. government, which has also <a href="https://thenextweb.com/distract/2019/11/22/these-songs-inspired-by-trumps-handwritten-quid-pro-quo-defense-are-peak-twitter/">restricted scientific research</a> into its effects.</p>
      <p>“States have led the way—and continue to lead the way—but our federal laws have not kept pace with the obvious need for change,” Nadler said in a statement. “We need to catch up because of public support and because it is the right thing to do.”</p>
      <p>One Republican on the committee was more circumspect.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think a majority of the Republicans will support this bill,” GOP Representative Ken Buck, a member of the Judiciary Committee, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/20/house-committee-approves-bill-decriminalizing-marijuana-on-the-federal-level.html">told CNBC</a>. “It is even less likely that the Senate would take it up. Therefore, I would just suggest that we deal with other bills that we can get a much larger bipartisan support from.”</p>
      <p>Virtually all of the leading Democratic candidates for president support marijuana legalization, with former Vice President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/politics/joe-biden-cory-booker-marijuana.html">mocked on the debate stage</a> Wednesday night for expressing his support of the <a href="https://www.theroot.com/ok-boomer-joe-biden-says-marijuana-is-a-gateway-drug-1839924760">gateway drug theory</a> and running on a platform that would keep marijuana <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/21/joe-biden-marijuana-072441">as a Schedule II drug</a>.</p>
      <p>With Pew Research Centre polling <a href="http://pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/11/14/americans-support-marijuana-legalization/">about 78 per cent</a> of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents saying marijuana should be legal, and another <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/the-new-progressive-agenda#marijuana">recent poll</a> by Data for Progress and Civis Analytics finding even a majority of Trump supporters are in favour, Biden seems to have staked out an <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/11/biden-marijuana-legalization-electability.html">extremely unpopular position</a> at a very bad time.</p>
      <p>While the Trump administration <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/marijuana/2019/09/03/president-trump-reiterates-his-administration-will-let-states-legalize-marijuana/q3O3QE1SZLO8o3u3XwoZKN/story.html">has largely refrained</a> from interfering with state-level legalisation initiatives, ABC noted he’s unlikely to sign a legalisation initiative into U.S. law.</p>
      <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement in August that Trump donated part of his 2019 salary to federal promotional campaigns warning about the dangers of marijuana. Former Trump attorney general Jeff Sessions <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-pot-trump-reaction-20180105-story.html">went full <i>Reefer Madness</i></a> on the issue, while successor Bill Barr has indicated that while he would prefer to keep marijuana illegal, he is fine with a <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2019/04/10/william-barr-cory-gardner-marijuana-legalization/">“more federal” approach</a> that would retain federal prohibition but allow individual states to set their own laws.</p>
