      <h1>Germany’s Kramp-Karrenbauer calls to set up digital ministry</h1>
      <h2>Similar ideas had been dropped because of resistance from Chancellor Angela Merkel.</h2>

      <p>LEIPZIG, Germany — Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the leader of Germany's Christian Democrats, said the country should have a digital ministry to make it fit for the digital age.</p>
      <p>“I’ve come to believe there is no way around establishing a ministry for digitalization,” she told a party summit in Leipzig.</p>
      <p>Kramp-Karrenbauer's comments are set to revive <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-digital-ministry-divide/">a discussion</a> that arose ahead of the country's general election in 2017 over whether Berlin needs a dedicated ministry to coordinate digital policy efforts.</p>
      <p>Eventually, such ideas were dropped because of resistance from Chancellor Angela Merkel, who instead appointed a high-ranking official inside her chancellery to coordinate digital efforts.</p>
      <p>Merkel has announced she will not run for chancellor in Germany's next general election in 2021. As CDU chief, Kramp-Karrenbauer is expected to be the party's candidate for the post instead.</p>
