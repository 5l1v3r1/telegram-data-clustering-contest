      <p>nZo (fka <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/enzo-amore">Enzo Amore</a>) discussed a variety of WWE topics during his appearance on Chris Jericho’s <a href="http://www.westwoodonepodcasts.com/pods/talk-is-jericho">Talk Is Jericho</a> podcast, including the time that he was fired by the company for breaking wind during an NXT promo class.</p>
      <p>The former Cruiserweight Champion revealed that he tried to lighten the mood after <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/baron-corbin">Baron Corbin</a> cut a “terrible” promo in front of Dusty Rhodes, but his attempt to entertain everybody else in the room backfired.</p>
      <blockquote>“One time we had a promo class [with] Dusty Rhodes, Baron Corbin was up there cutting a terrible promo. Baron was trying to get help and Dusty was helping him, and I just raised my hand and everybody looked at me, and I just farted, loud as hell. They fined me two hundred and fifty dollars, fired me that night, and then I got back into work the next day and they rehired me.”</blockquote>

      <h4>Enzo Amore’s WWE career highlights</h4>
      <p>After establishing themselves as one of the most popular acts in NXT, Enzo Amore and Big Cass moved to RAW in April 2016 after WrestleMania 32.</p>
      <p>They worked with some of the biggest names in the company during their first year on the Red brand, including John Cena and Chris Jericho, before WWE decided to separate them by turning Cass heel in June 2017.</p>
      <p>Amore has mentioned in past media interviews that one of his career highlights came at WrestleMania 33, where he teamed with Cass in a Fatal 4-Way ladder match against The Bar, The Club and the returning Hardy Boyz.</p>
      <p>Before he was fired by WWE in January 2018, Amore had a four-month run as the main star in the cruiserweight division on RAW and 205 Live.</p>
