      <p>Danielle Armstrong moved her baby-daddy Tom in with her after just two weeks of dating - and found out she was pregnant shortly after.</p>
      <p>The former TOWIE star revealed the 'mystery man' she was papped with on holiday in Spain was in fact her childhood sweetheart who she met at school more than two decades ago.</p>
      <p>And the pair fell head over heels in love after meeting up for drinks and taking their friendship to the next level.</p>
      <p>Launching her new YouTube channel, Danni Keeping It Real, Danielle said: "The last four months have been crazy, I not only met the love of my life, who moved in with me after two weeks of dating - I did know him 22 years...</p>
      <p>"I even want to try and film the birth, Tommy's being a bit funny about it but I do think we can get around it."</p>

      <p>Speaking about their whirlwind relationship, Danielle said: "Basically I met Tom, I moved in with him, then I got pregnant</p>
      <p>"He's been known for the last four months just as 'mystery man'."</p>
      <p>Laughing and touching each other as they snuggled up on the sofa, Danielle and Tom explained how they first met at school.</p>
      <p>"You looked at me and thought, 'gonna have a baby with that girl'," Dan joked.</p>

      <p>"But you were never interested in me," Tom pointed out.</p>
      <p>"No, I weren't, I wasn't actually that interested. I quite liked the older boy at school, we didn't really like going out with boys in our year," Danielle recalled.</p>
      <p>"We did have a little thing at 18 at school, then you weren't interested again. Kept me waiting," explained her beau.</p>
      <p>Looking back over the last few weeks, Danielle said: "Four months, it has gone quite quick, it's like it's meant to be.</p>

      <p>"We had a few drinks, things got a little bit flirty between us. When Tom gets drunk he repeats himself constantly. 'Didn't think you were interested' - he said it 100 times.</p>
      <p>"Then we went on a date and I'll be quite honest, it was one of those moments."</p>
      <p>Giving advice to other people who are thinking of dating a good friend, Danielle suggested it's best to be honest with each other about fears of losing the friendship.</p>
      <p>"And the sex part, you want to make sure it's there - you don't want to think it's like sleeping with a friend," she giggled.</p>

      <p>The couple got together after one date, then Tom took the week off work to help her move office.</p>
      <p>She then invited him out to Spain, where she'd gone on a girls holiday with bestie Ferne McCann and her little girl Sunday.</p>
      <p>"You came out and you asked me to be your girlfriend," Danielle prompted Tom.</p>
      <p>"Yeah - Ferne bullied me into it!" he joked.</p>
