      <p>A case is a great way to keep your device protected, and depending on what you’re looking for you can find one thin enough to fit easily enough in a pocket. But maybe you want your phone to be a bit easier to grasp when you need it. A belt clip case can make that a possibility.</p>
      <p>Luckily there are plenty of options for this style of case for the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/iphone-11/">iPhone 11</a>, <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/iphone-11-pro/">iPhone 11 Pro</a>, and iPhone 11 Pro Max. We’ve put together a nice list of some of the best just below.</p>

      <p>This rugged case from AICase offers a firm belt clip, while also offering a tough case with multiple layers of protection for good measure. Each case is designed specifically to perfectly fit the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, or iPhone 11 Pro Max, and should help protect against not only drops, but keep dirt away from your phone, too.</p>
      <p>Inside is a “solid inner polycarbonate shell”, while the outside is made from soft thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). It features a grip-friendly design, aiming to make the case easy to hold and comfortable to use on a daily basis. There are port covers as well.</p>
      <p>Positive reviews for this case indicate that the case is indeed plenty rugged and offers quite a bit of protection, especially compared to more expensive options out there. Others point out how securely the phone fits inside.</p>
      <p>The AICase belt clip case is available in Stormy Seas Blue/White, Red/Black, Night Purple/Baby Pink, Gray/White/Pink Tree, Grey/White, Black/Blaze Orange/Tree, and Black. It’s priced at $15.99 and available to buy now.</p>

      <p>If you prefer to avoid a case and just want some additional protection for your iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, or iPhone 11 Pro Max while it’s on your hip, then this belt clip holster may be the option for you. This is designed by Monsoon, and it features a genuine leather holster that perfectly fits the newest iPhone models.</p>
      <p>It also fits Apple’s iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max models, depending on the case you choose.</p>
      <p>Monsoon says the leather holster offers enough space to fit single- and dual-layer cases, including Apple’s own leather case and similar options from other companies — up to 0.55″ thickness.</p>
      <p>The belt clip on the back doesn’t rotate, and it’s made from zinc alloy, so it should keep working for quite a while, even with every day usage. Indeed, positive reviews not only note how well-made the holster itself is, and the overall quality, but also the inclusion of the metal belt clip for longevity.</p>
      <p>The Monsoon belt clip holster is available in black and retails for $29.99. It’s available to buy now.</p>

      <p>This is a slim profile case and belt clip combo from Encased, made for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max. The case is made from a flexible TPU material, which Encased says will help protect your device from drops and scratches. All without adding the general bulk of a rugged case.</p>
      <p>The case is built to be easy to use on a daily basis, and features an embedded grip pattern on the back. Meanwhile, the belt clip can rotate, which means you can use the clip both vertically and horizontally.</p>
      <p>The positive marks given for the case include how well it fits on the phone, the slim profile, and the protection it affords despite its relative thin design. Others praise the overall quality for the price.</p>
      <p>Encased’s Thin Armor belt clip case is available only in black, and it retails for $16.99. It’s available now.</p>

      <h3>ZIZO</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>This is a heavy duty rugged case from ZIZO, part of their Bolt series. It features a pretty unique design, but also offers a lot of bang for the buck. That includes the dual-layer protection design, which disperses impact force when the phone is dropped. ZIZO says that the Bolt case for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro case “exceeds 12 Feet Military Grade Drop Test 810.1-G standards.”</p>
      <p>The shock-resistant core is bolstered by the rugged outer shell, and this bundle actually includes not only a lanyard, but also a tempered glass screen protector for good measure. The belt clip on the back features a 360-degree rotating design.</p>
      <p>Owners of the case praise the durable design, the price, the inclusion of a screen protector, and the rotating belt clip. Some negative marks say that the belt clip itself might be too thick for some, so be aware of that.</p>
      <p>The ZIZO Bolt series rugged belt clip case is available now in Black/Black, Black/Red, Blue/Black, Gun Metal Gray/Black, and Red/Black. It’s priced at $18.99.</p>
      <p>

      <h3>Bomea</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The Bomea belt clip holster from PiTau is another full-body holster for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max. However, instead of a vertical setup it offers a horizontal design, along with a strong magnetic closure to make sure the lid stays shut. The holster is designed from high-quality premium leather.</p>
      <p>It can fit each of Apple’s newest iPhones, but also the iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max depending on your case of choice. And if you have one of last year’s iPhones, you can even install a thin case and it will fit in this new belt clip holster. (The listing doesn’t suggest you can also use a case for the iPhone 11 or iPhone 11 Pro lineup.)</p>
      <p>There are actually two ways to wear this leather belt clip holster. The first, and most obvious, is the nylon belt clip, which does not rotate. There is also a belt loop option, which means you can skip the belt clip if you prefer.</p>
      <p>This belt clip holster also provides a built-in pocket at the front of the holster, protected when the lid is closed. That pocket can hold your most important credit card-sized card or piece of identification.</p>
      <p>The majority of positive reviews praise the design and durability of the case itself, as well as the materials used and the belt clip’s sturdiness. There are some negative reviews that claim, after a few months, the case isn’t holding fast to its original quality, but that could be based on usage. Just something to be aware of.</p>
      <p>The Bomea belt clip holster is available now in black leather. It’s priced at $10.99.</p>

      <p>This Scorpio rugged belt clip case from Encased is available for the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro Max (not the iPhone 11 Pro), and it offers heavy duty rugged protection while keeping the design relatively slim. The case features curved buttons with tactile feedback, and the belt clip on the back can swivel and is steel-rivet reinforced.</p>
      <p>The case itself features a matte non-slip finish, and the corners have even more protection to help protect the phone against drops.</p>
      <p>The Scorpio rugged belt clip case from Encased is available now for $17.99.</p>
