          <p>During the first day of the second Test of the ongoing Bangladesh’s tour of India at the Eden Gardens, India captain Virat Kohli was seen calling out for the Indian physio after Bangladesh spinner Nayeem Hasan was hit by a brutal bouncer from India pacer Mohammed Shami.</p>
          <p>It all happened on the first delivery of the 23rd over when Hasan didn’t manage to sway away from a pinpoint bouncer from Shami. With the ball coming into the batsman, it was too good to handle for a lower-order batsman.</p>

                      <p>It is worth mentioning that Shami had previously hit Bangladesh wicket-keeper batsman Liton Das on his helmet. With Das already out due to concussion, the Bangladeshi physio is expected to be catering to Das when Hasan got hit.</p>
                      <p>After the Bangladeshi physio came out to the field to attend to Hasan, it was decided that he would continue to bat. On the penultimate delivery of the 30th over, India pacer Ishant Sharma bowled Hasan (19) to dismiss the ninth Bangladeshi batsman.</p>

                          <p>After Bangladesh captain Mominul Haque won the toss and chose to bat, a shambolic batting performance saw the visitors getting bundling out for 106 in 30.3 overs. With bowling figures of 12-4-22-4, Ishant Sharma was the pick of Indian bowlers.</p>
