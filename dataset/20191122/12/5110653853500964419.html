      <p>The Texans took an importantstep toward claiming an AFC South crown with a 20-17 win over the Colts on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Their offensive lineprotected quarterback Deshaun Watson well and allowed him to pick apart a shaky Indianapolis secondary. Watson threw for 298 yards, two touchdowns and an interception.</p>
      <p>Wideouts Will Fuller (140 receiving yards) and DeAndre Hopkins (94 receiving yards) repeatedly beat single coverage, particularly in the second half when the Colts (6-5) were forced to be aggressive on defense against the Texans (7-4).</p>

      <h3>Colts vs. Texans highlights, analysis</h3>
      <h4>Final: Texans 20, Colts 17</h4>
      <p><b>11:15 p.m. —</b> WOW. Watson lost the football on a run, but the referees determined he was down. There will not be a review, which is pretty odd. Of note: Even if it was ruled a fumble on a review, retroactively determining a change possession would have been difficult.</p>

      <p><b>11:11 p.m. —</b> Fuller makes an 11-yard catch to convert. The Colts have one timeout remaining with 1:52 on the clock.</p>
      <p><b>11:09 p.m. —</b> Two-minute warning. Third down upcoming for the Texans. If they convert, the game is essentially over.</p>
      <p><b>11:07 p.m. —</b> Stopped!<b> </b>Indianapolis goes for it on fourth-and-7 and Brissett's scramble comes up short. Texans ball. Less than three minutes left.</p>

      <p><b>11:04 p.m. —</b> And now the Colts may regret bleeding so much time. It's fourth down near midfield.</p>
      <p><b>11:03 p.m. —</b> Despite playing from behind, the Colts seem content to stick with the ground-and-pound style that has kept them in this one. They've dipped the clock to 3:30.</p>

      <p><b>10:47 p.m. —</b> Hilton comes verrrrrry close to making a huge downfield reception, but the deep ball is broken up and the Colts need to punt.</p>
      <p><b>10:38 p.m. — TOUCHDOWN, Texans.</b> The Colts have been helpless all night against Houston's aerial attack. Hopkins secures a 35-yard TD reception. <b>20-17, Texans.</b></p>

      <p><b>10:37 p.m. —</b> Down four points, the Texans are now in field goal range early in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <h4>End of third quarter: Colts 17, Texans 13</h4>
      <p><b>10:32 p.m. —</b> Houston gets the ball back and immediately goes to Hopkins for a first down. That'll move us to the final period.</p>
      <p><b>10:22 p.m. — FIELD GOAL, Texans.</b> Fairbairn doinks one off the post and in. <b>17-13, Colts.</b></p>
      <p><b>10:19 p.m. —</b> Watson-to-Fuller. Again. Fuller has 122 receiving yards.</p>

      <p><b>10:11 p.m. —</b> Indianapolis keeps grinding with the run, and it's working. Hines charges inside the 20.</p>
      <p><b>10:05 p.m. —</b> The Texans turn it over on downs. They attempted a fourth down on the Indianapolis 34, but Watson's pass fell incomplete.</p>
      <p><b>10:01 p.m. —</b> Fuller makes a fantastic deep grab, holding on as a stumbled forward.</p>

      <p><b>9:50 p.m. —</b> After a dull first quarter, both offenses showed signs of life in the second quarter. Indianapolis has maybe been a bit more on its game plan of setting up Brissett with a strong run game; the Colts already have 70 rushing yards. Houston, though, has done well on third down and Watson is making throws when he needs to.</p>
      <h4>Halftime: Colts 10, Texans 10</h4>
