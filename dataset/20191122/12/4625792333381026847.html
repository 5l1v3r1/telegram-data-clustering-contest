      <p>A new poll shows support for the impeachment of President Trump has declined since public hearings have started.</p>
      <p>The Emerson poll <a href="http://emersonpolling.com/2019/11/21/november-national-poll-support-for-impeachment-declines-biden-and-sanders-lead-democratic-primary/">released</a> Thursday found support for impeachment has dropped from 48% to 43% since October, while opposition to impeachment has risen from 44% to 45%.</p>
      <p>Independents are key in the shift, with 49% opposing impeachment and only 34% supporting impeachment. In October, 48% of independents supported impeachment and 39% opposed.</p>
      <p>The poll also showed Trump's approval rating rising to a net positive. Forty-eight percent approved of the president while 47% disapproved. His approval rating was only 43% a month ago.</p>
      <p>A Morning Consult- <i>Politico poll </i>this week also showed independents are <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/poll-opposition-to-trump-impeachment-jumps-10-among-independents">beginning to oppose impeachment</a> as the second week of public hearings wraps up. The poll found a 10% drop in support from independents since the beginning of public hearings.</p>
