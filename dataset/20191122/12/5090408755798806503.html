      <p>A Brazilian footballer has been given a one match ban by the Ukrainian FA (UAF) for reacting to reported racial abuse directed at him during a match on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Taison, who plays for Shakhtar Donestk, raised his middle finger and kicked the ball at Dynamo Kiev fans in the 77th minute during a match on November 10, before the referee halted the game and took the players off.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old and his teammate Dentinho, who also was targeted, left the field in tears, however upon returning five minutes later, he was shown a red card.</p>

      <p>The UAF confirmed it had upheld Taison’s suspension on Thursday, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50508069">according to the BBC.</a></p>
      <p>Kiev fans, who were warned twice during the game for racist behaviour, will not be allowed to attend their club’s next match, while the club itself was fined $21,000, says the BBC.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50508069">Shakhtar midfielder Marcos Antonio said after the incident:</a> “It’s terrible when such things happen in football. The game needs real fans instead of the people who come to the stadium and behave like that, not respecting the athletes.</p>
      <p>“We need to work on this because such episodes upset us all.”</p>

      <p>FIFPro, the world football players’ union, released a statement on Thursday condemning both the Kiev fans and the UFA.</p>
      <p>“We are very disappointed by the decision of the Ukrainian FA to hand Taison a one-match ban,” it said, <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11866755/shakhtar-donetsks-taison-banned-for-reaction-to-alleged-racism">according to Sky Sports.</a></p>
      <p>“Sanctioning a victim of racial abuse is beyond comprehension and it plays into the hands of those who promote this kind of disgraceful behavior.”</p>
      <p>The UFA did not immediately respond to Business Insider’s request for comment.</p>
