      <p>Police in Ntungamo has confiscated over 40 petition forms drafted by the Forum for Democratic Party (FDC) to drag President Museveni to the International Criminal Court (ICC). </p>
      <p>Police yesterday Thursday grabbed the forms from a shop owned by the Ntungamo municipality FDC chairperson, Denis Mugizi. The police action comes barely days after news started circulating in the area that the chairperson was mobilizing residents to sign the petition. The raid was led by Vian Habineza a crime intelligence officer at Ntungamo police station. </p>
      <p>Mugizi says that he first received calls from Habineza asking him to record a statement but had asked to be given time so that he first consults his lawyers. Ntungamo district FDC chairperson Benon Ntendere says that they are in contact with party lawyers to see that documents confiscated from Mugizi are not used against him. </p>
      <p>Ntendere further reveals that they are disappointed by the actions of the police, saying that the party has the freedom to perform its duties and the police should respect rights instead of resort to raids and intimidating the party members.</p>
      <p>Ntungamo district police commander Damiano Katwesimwe confirmed that the forms were confiscated by did not divulge further details. Last week, the security operatives raided the officials of the home of Kalyatha Bwambale, a renowned FDC supporter in Kisolholho village of Kitholhu sub-county in Kasese.</p>
      <p>Two weeks ago, the 'People’s Government' led Rtd Col Kizza Besigye launched a campaign to collect two million signatures aimed at asking the prosecutor at the ICC, Justice Fatou Bensouda to prosecute Museveni and his implicated officials on alleged crimes against humanity.</p>
      <p>According to Ingrid Turinawe, the FDC secretary for mobilisation, more than 60,000 people have so far appended their signatures on the hard copies of the forms and that more forms were being dispatched to the districts.</p>
      <p>Early this week, unknown thugs broke into FDC party headquarters in Najjanankumbi and stole computers and documents believed to contain the petition forms. Two days ago, about 30 police personnel raided the FDC offices in Kasese and confiscated several documents including ICC petition forms. </p>
