      <p>Friday’s three big stock charts focus on stocks that look a bit wobbly at the moment. That seems fitting because the broad market suddenly looks that way as well.</p>

      <p>It’s not time to panic yet. The <b>S&amp;P 500</b>, for instance, is down half a percentage point for the week after closing Friday at an all-time high. Still, the index has finished in the red for three consecutive sessions, and the same has been true for the <b>Dow Jones Industrial Average</b>.</p>
      <p>In this week’s trading, there’s a case for at least modest caution. The impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives is kicking off a year of political news served to a sharply divided populace. Valuations look stretched in some sectors of the market. Earnings this week have not been impressive, particularly on the retail front. A whiff by <b>Home Depot</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/hd-stock-quote/"><b><u>HD</u></b></a>) raises concerns about the key construction sector, while department stores <b>Kohl’s</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/kss-stock-quote/"><b><u>KSS</u></b></a>) and <b>Macy’s</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/m-stock-quote/"><b><u>M</u></b></a>) declined ahead of <a href="https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/heres-crazy-reason-why-holiday-season-is-6-days-shorter-in-2019.html">a compressed holiday shopping season</a>.</p>
      <p>Again, a sell-off isn’t necessarily imminent, but the market suddenly seems more uncertain than it has at any point in the last few months. Friday’s big stock charts look at stocks in a similar situation. All three have done reasonably well of late. But both technically and fundamentally, there’s a real possibility that all three could pull back.</p>
      <h3>Micron Technology (MU)</h3>

      <p>I wrote this week that <b>Micron Technology</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/mu-stock-quote/"><b><u>MU</u></b></a>) could be <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/micron-stock-mu-stock-headed-fall/">headed for a fall</a>, and the first of Friday’s big stock charts is just one reason why:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The technicals look concerning for several reasons. MU stock has broken out to the downside of both a sideways triangle and a longer-term ascending narrowing wedge. Both moves usually are bearish and signal further weakness ahead. Combined with low volume and the recent dip below the 20- and 50-day moving averages, and MU stock at the moment seems to have a clear path to the 200 DMA closer to $42, about 7% further downside.</li>
        <li>There’s also the fact that the rest of the semiconductor sector mostly has soared. <b>Advanced Micro Devices</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/amd-stock-quote/"><b><u>AMD</u></b></a>) has broken out. <b>Nvidia</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/nvda-stock-quote/"><b><u>NVDA</u></b></a>) has gained over 40% since early August. Meanwhile, Micron stock and fellow memory play <b>Western Digital</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/wdc-stock-quote/"><b><u>WDC</u></b></a>) are moving in the wrong direction. Investors are buying chip stocks — just not memory chip stocks. Indeed, WDC’s bearish chart was <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/3-big-stock-charts-for-thursday-gilead-sciences-docusign-and-western-digital/">highlighted in this space</a> last week, and it’s kept slipping since. MU stock looks like it’s on a similar path.</li>
        <li>Fundamentally, MU stock is cheap enough if earnings are at a bottom. But there’s some indication that memory pricing isn’t set to revert quite as quickly as bulls hope. The recent weakness in Micron stock may be a reflection of that realization, and it might be a harbinger of more disappointment ahead.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>International Paper (IP)</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>There have been quite a few beaten-down potential value names like <b>International Paper</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/ip-stock-quote/"><b><u>IP</u></b></a>) that have rallied of late. <b>AT&amp;T</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/t-stock-quote/"><b><u>T</u></b></a>) might qualify, even if its rally admittedly began in December. <b>IBM</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/ibm-stock-quote/"><b><u>IBM</u></b></a>) has had a few bounces. Kohl’s stock gained nicely before wiping out after earnings this week. <b>Rite Aid</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/rad-stock-quote/"><b><u>RAD</u></b></a>), which had fallen over 90% in three years, has almost doubled from summer lows.</p>
      <p>There are other examples as well that show what looks like a shift <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/10/3-big-stock-charts-wednesday-starbucks-nordstrom-salesforce-com/">from growth to value</a> that began in late August. But many of those names have weakened of late, and the second of our big stock charts suggests IP might be next:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>IP stock stalled out before returning to past highs at $48, creating a narrowing wedge pattern of lower highs. Shares now are below the 20-day moving average, with the 200DMA and 50DMA next up.</li>
        <li>
          <figure>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Moving out to the weekly chart, the same trend seems to hold. IP stock remains in a downtrend that commenced at the beginning of last year.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Fundamentally, IP stock admittedly looks more attractive. The forward price-to-earnings multiple looks cheap at under 12x. A 4.6% dividend yield could draw income investors, particularly with 10-year Treasuries yielding under 2%.</li>
        <li>But these high-dividend value stocks too often have been value traps in this market. IBM and KSS have provided negative total returns over most holding periods. Even AT&amp;T stock has underperformed the market including dividends and the recent rally. It does seem like stocks like IP drew in investors looking for value at the end of the summer — and that those investors may have realized that a cheap multiple and a high dividend alone aren’t enough. There’s some evidence in the chart that IP may resume the downward trend of other potential yield traps.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Electronic Arts (EA)</h3>

      <p>The range keeps narrowing for video game developer <b>Electronic Arts</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/ea-stock-quote/"><b><u>EA</u></b></a>). That usually suggests a breakout in one direction; at the moment, the third of Friday’s big stock charts does lean bullish, but the fundamentals raise some concern:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>EA stock definitely has a setup that could lead to a bullish breakout. A move back above $100 would break the sideways wedge. Unsurprisingly given trading since February, moving averages are tightly grouped, and they could provide support in coming sessions. Low volume is a concern in terms of expecting anything like a parabolic move higher, but EA stock has ground in the right direction since late July and there’s some evidence on that chart to suggest that trend can continue.</li>
        <li>At the same time, however, the technicals highlight a fundamental issue: EA stock <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/why-electronic-arts-stock-desperately-needs-a-catalyst/">desperately needs a catalyst</a>, as I wrote this week. Its core franchises all are long in the tooth. ‘Battle royale’ game “Apex Legends” has disappointed after <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/02/thanks-apex-electronic-arts-stock-back/">an auspicious beginning</a>, and the new “Star Wars” game looks well-reviewed but not big enough to move the needle. The fundamentals too don’t yet suggest a compelling case for EA stock unless and until something changes.</li>
        <li>That said, there are worse plays in this market — and it’s possible that both technically and fundamentally EA stock is in a better position than it might first appear. EA stock is cheap enough to rally. Peers <b>Take-Two Interactive</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/ttwo-stock-quote/"><b><u>TTWO</u></b></a>) and <b>Activision Blizzard</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/atvi-stock-quote/"><b><u>ATVI</u></b></a>) both have had breakouts of their own in 2019; Electronic Arts stock might be ‘due’ to follow. If investors are seeking value in a market just off all-time highs, but worried about weaker names and/or leveraged balance sheets, a stock like EA could be just what they’re looking for, with or without a near-term catalyst.</li>
      </ul>
