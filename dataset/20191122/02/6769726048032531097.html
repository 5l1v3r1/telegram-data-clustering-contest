      <p>THE first stage of one of WA’s biggest urban infill developments project has been completed and will be open to the public tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Northern Parklands in Bentley will officially be opened from 1pm with workshops, performances, activities and food trucks.</p>
      <p>The 12-hectare parklands, a temporary mix of recreational areas for the community, is part of the Bentley 360 development project being constructed at <a href="https://www.communitynews.com.au/canning-times/news/brownlie-towers-no-more-as-work-begins-on-next-step/">the demolished Brownlie Towers site</a>.</p>

      <p>About 32.5 million kilograms of steel, concrete, brick, subgrade and soil, which represented 98 per cent of the debris resulting from the towers’ demolition, was recycled and repurposed.</p>
      <p>Some of the materials were used by contractors Landscape Elements to deliver the Northern Parklands.</p>
      <p>Victoria Park MLA Ben Wyatt said the parklands were designed in close consultation with local schoolchildren.</p>
      <p>“The landscaping plans were developed with the help of students and teachers from Bentley Primary School and Santa Clara Primary School to ensure the community’s wishes were reflected in the design,” he said.</p>
      <p>This included innovative upcycling of hard items for shade structures, seating and basketball hoops, through to the milling of ill-health trees into benches and the re-use of footpath slabs and other heavy infrastructure for kerbing, footpaths and bike track.</p>
      <p>The recreation area, designed to maximise opportunities for people with disability, also includes nature-based play equipment, a running track, public art, community amenities, an outdoor classroom and specialised lighting.</p>
      <p>The facilities will remain in place while the broader Bentley 360 development is delivered over the coming 10 to 15 years.</p>

      <p>Housing Minister Peter Tinley said the Northern Parklands marked the second milestone for the Bentley 360 project, following the demolition of Brownlie Towers in June.</p>
      <p>“The Bentley 360 project will deliver at least 1,500 new homes over a 15 to 20-year time frame,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It is expected to create and support more than 2,200 jobs across the course of development and inject an estimated $1.08 billion into WA’s economy.”</p>
      <p>The main entrance to the parklands for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/440140976700967/">tomorrow’s event</a> is via Taree Street, just off Walpole Street.</p>
