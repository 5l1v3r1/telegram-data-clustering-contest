      <p>Warburg Pincus, Avaloq and the banks declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Avaloq Chief Executive Juerg Hunziger had said this year that the company was preparing for an IPO or sale within the next two to four years.</p>
      <p>Avaloq, founded in 1985 as BZ Informatik, supplies software for financial institutions such as Barclays, BBVA , Deutsche Bank , HSBC Rothschild , Societe Generale and Vontobel . Its software programmes manage US$4.5 trillion in client money.</p>
      <p>In the first half of 2019, Avaloq reported a 5per cent year-on-year increase in revenues as well as core earnings, to 288 million francs in sales and adjusted EBITDA of 38 million.</p>
      <p>Larger and more profitable rival Temenos trades at 25 times its expected core earnings.</p>
