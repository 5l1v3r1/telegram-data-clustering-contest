      <h1>Prince Andrew forced to fire loyal aide by Queen as Her Majesty lays down law</h1>
      <h2>Prince Andrew has fired his most trusted aide Amanda Thirsk over her role in organising his disastrous BBC Newsnight interview where he failed to express regret over his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T02:43:02+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 02:43</time> by <a rel="author">Russell Myers, Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/russell-myers/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>A royal source claims Prince Andrew’s trusted aide Amanda Thirsk was shown the door after her catastrophic decision to allow the Duke of York to appear on Newsnight.</p>
      <p>After being forced to step down from public duties and losing his money from the Sovereign Grant, Andrew was told loyal Ms Thirsk would be sacked from her publicly funded role.</p>
      <p>However, royal sources confirmed than Andrew “vowed to keep her on his staff” and would use his own millionaire funds to pay her wages.</p>
      <p>Ms Thirsk, who is on the board of Andrew’s beloved Pitch@Palace project, was said to be “mortified” at the fall out after the Duke’s car crash interview.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York has cancelled a trip to Bahrain as the fallout over his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein continues, it has been reported.</p>

      <p>The Daily Mail said Ms Thirsk, believed to have been the driving force behind Andrew's catastrophic Newsnight interview, will now run the business mentorship scheme after she was dismissed on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Ms Thirsk will also manage the Duke of York Inspiring Digital Enterprise Award after the duke quit his life as a working royal on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>It has also been reported Buckingham Palace was disturbed by the mention of Andrew's relationship with Epstein in the ITV election debate on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>The Times said senior aides and the Prince of Wales advised the Queen that Andrew should be withdrawn from public life after concerns the scandal was overshadowing the democratic process.</p>
      <p>Despite stepping back from public life, Andrew will be continuing with Pitch@Palace "outside and entirely separate from the palace," a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>It is thought he will not have any involvement with the dozens of other charities, organisations and military units with which he has been associated.</p>
      <p>Pitch will become a private initiative separate from the public work he has relinquished after the backlash following the television interview about his friendship with Epstein, widely viewed as a PR disaster.</p>
      <p>However, several organisations have distanced themselves from the duke in the aftermath of the Queen's second son announcing he would step down from public duties for the "foreseeable future".</p>
      <p>Pressure had been mounting on the duke in the wake of his interview, with a growing number of multimillion-pound businesses, universities and charities distancing themselves from him and Pitch@Palace.</p>

      <p>By Thursday, two organisations had severed ties with him and a sponsor of Pitch@Palace said Andrew's plans to continue leading it were "not tenable".</p>
      <p>The Outward Bound Trust - which Andrew has supported for decades - accepted his resignation as patron and Huddersfield University confirmed the duke would be relinquishing his role as its chancellor.</p>
      <p>A source, speaking for a sponsor of Andrew's Pitch@Palace, said his desire to carry on as normal would not work and if its "reputational" problems continued the backer would end its contract.</p>
