      <h1>Nitro looks to blast apart IPO gloom with $325m float</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T02:25:36+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 02:25</time> by <a rel="author">Colin Kruger</a></address>
      <p>A string of failed ASX listings hasn't deterred productivity software vendor Nitro Software from seeking to raise as much as $110 million via an initial public offering that is expected to result in an ASX launch on December 11, according to a prospectus lodged with the corporate regulator.</p>
      <p>Nitro's listing plans come after the cancellation of six IPOs in October, with PropertyGuru and Boost Juice owner Retail Zoo among the companies failing to make it to market. Last month, the Ahmed Fahour-led consumer finance group Latitude <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p530tr.html">failed to float</a> for the second time in two years.</p>

      <p>Nitro said the offer price will be $1.72 per share, valuing the Melbourne-founded Adobe rival which sells digital document software at $325 million.</p>
      <p>The company is forecasting revenue of $40.5 million for the 2019-20 financial year and a net loss of $7 million.</p>
      <p>Current investors will pocket more than $44 million of the proceeds raised by the IPO. The rest of the money will be used to pay down existing debt and fund future growth, the company said.</p>

      <p>"We founded Nitro nearly 15 years ago with a simple vision to make document productivity easy, powerful, affordable and available to all," said company co-founder and chief executive Sam Chandler.</p>
      <p>"Today we serve millions of users every month and count thousands of businesses, government agencies and educational institutions as our customers," he said.</p>
      <p>"We are currently seeing the adoption of document productivity and eSignature solutions driven by strong global trends," said company chairman Kurt Johnson.</p>

      <p>Mr Chandler started the business in 2005 in response to his own frustrations with Adobe's Acrobat PDF product, which was only reaching a fraction of its potential audience.</p>
      <p>"We discovered that even among some of the Fortune 500 companies, true document collaboration capabilities extended only to five or 10 per cent of the total number of users inside that organisation," he <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-hv1s9.html">told</a> the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> and <i>The Age</i> in 2013.</p>
      <p>"Most companies were just looking at the documents â€“ they wouldn't collaborate on them. It's like giving someone a piece of paper but not a pen to mark it up."</p>
      <p>The offer is being managed and underwritten by Morgan Stanley.</p>
