      <p>REUTERS: U.S. health officials on Thursday reported 2,290 confirmed and probable cases and 5 more deaths from a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, taking the total death toll to 47 so far this year.</p>
      <p>As of Nov. 20, these deaths have been confirmed in 25 states and the District of Columbia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.</p>

      <p>Last week, the agency reported 2,172 cases and 42 deaths from the illness.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, U.S. officials reported the discovery of vitamin E acetate — believed to be used as a cutting agent in illicit vaping products containing marijuana components — in all lung samples from 29 patients who were tested.</p>
      <p>CDC has called vitamin E acetate a "chemical of concern" and recommended that the substance not be added to e-cigarettes, or vaping products, while the investigation is ongoing.</p>
