      <h1>Paul Finebaum On CFB Playoff Chairman Rob Mullens: “I Don’t Trust Him”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T02:28:23+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 02:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this week, the College Football Playoff committee released its rankings following Week 12 of the college football season.</p>
      <p>LSU remained on top, followed by Ohio State, Clemson and Georgia which rounded out the current playoff foursome.</p>
      <p>Just outside, Alabama came in at No. 5 and Oregon came in at No. 6. After the release of the rankings on Tuesday night, committee chairman Rob Mullens spends hours answering questions from reporters.</p>
      <p>The Oregon athletic director does his best to explain why each team holds its respective ranking. Fans obviously have their own opinions about their teams, but there’s a prominent ESPN personality who said he doesn’t trust Mullens.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Paul Finebaum made his thoughts about the committee chairman known during his show on Thursday, via <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/ducks/2019/11/espns-paul-finebaum-questions-credibility-of-oregon-ad-cfp-selection-committee-chair-rob-mullens-i-dont-trust-him-because-hes-not-honest.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=oregoniansports_sf">Oregon Live</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“I frankly don’t know if I trust this guy being in charge. I don’t trust him because he’s not honest, and I just think he has an influence on that committee. Maybe I should save my powder if Oregon gets in, but then it’s going to be too late.”</blockquote>
      <p>It’s a bold take from Finebaum, who later said previously that he was friends with Mullens. However, Finebaum isn’t the only one to question the process.</p>
      <p>Having a standing athletic director help determine which teams should make the playoff will always bring questions – especially when their respective school is in the hunt.</p>
