      <h3> Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja and Osagie Otabor, Benin</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>HUNDREDS of All Progressives Congress (APC) members on Thursday stormed the party’s National Secretariat in protest, calling for National Chairman Adams Oshiomhole’s resignation.</p>
      <p>The protesters, under the aegis of APC Patriotic Stakeholders’ Forum, claimed to have gathered from across the country.</p>
      <p>They alleged that Oshiomhole failed to uphold APC constitution’s tenets, which has led to divisions within the party across the country, especially in his home state, Edo</p>
      <p>But, Chief Press Secretary to the APC National Chairman, Mr Simon Ebegbulem, said the protesters were sponsored by the Edo State government and should be ignored.</p>
      <p>The protesters urged President Muhammadu Buhari; APC stalwart Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; and other leaders and stakeholders of the party to prevail on Oshiomhole to resign.</p>
      <p>Speaking on behalf of the protesters, Iyoha Toni Osaigbovo, from Edo State, said the protest was organised to save the soul of the APC.</p>
      <p>His words: “I’m from Edo State and I am a member of APC Patriotic Stakeholders Forum. We have come to save our party. The person that we gave the mantle to uphold our constitution, we have realised that he is the person attacking the constitution.</p>
      <p>“He swore to protect our great party but so far what we have seen is not what is working. He is the person attacking the constitution. He has created a faction in the party in our state.</p>
      <p>“We are begging Mr President to please save this party because Adams Oshiomhole came to meet this party. There was a national chairman before Oshiomhole. We do not see the reason Adams Oshiomhole will destroy this party.</p>
      <p>“We are begging the President to come to our aid because the person that is supposed to uphold the constitution is destroying the constitution.</p>
      <p>“Our constitution is very clear, the National Working Committee (NWC) has no disciplinary power, but under Oshiomhole, the NWC is usurping the power of NEC.</p>
      <p>“There is nowhere in the constitution that says NWC has disciplinary power. How come under Oshiomhole the issues are now different? So, we are begging the president, it is time for us to start healing, enough of fighting.”</p>
      <p>But, Ebegbulem said the leader of the protest is one of Governor Godwin Obaseki’s appointees.</p>
      <p>“Ignore them, they are people hired by the Edo State government, who in turn went to hire some Hausa people. The so-called protest was led by Obaseki’s Special Adviser (Politics).</p>

      <p>“They are not even APC members. It’s a sponsored protest, sponsored by the Edo State government,” the spokesman said.</p>
      <p>Also yesterday, the Road Transport Employers of Nigeria (RTEAN) in Edo State pledged support for Obaseki.</p>
      <p>It condemned what it termed deliberate attempt by some persons to jeopardise functions of the State House of Assembly and lingering attempts to deny Governor Obaseki and his deputy, Philip Shaibu, a second term.</p>
      <p>State Chairman of RTEAN, Comrade Sunday Erhahon, who spoke at a press briefing in Benin City, said Governor Obaseki has done his best to reposition the state for dividends of democracy to flourish.</p>
      <p>Erhahon asked why Obaseki’s re-election bid has become a subject of debate and political bickering when former Governors in the state had second terms without wrangling.</p>
      <p>Erhahon said RTEAN remained committed to the ideals of democracy, good governance and principles of liberty as enshrined in the nation’s Constitution.</p>
      <p>His words: “It is our conviction that the duo of Governor Obaseki and Shaibu have brought significant changes to Edo State especially in the areas of infrastructural development, human capital development, peace and good governance.</p>
      <p>“There is peace and sanity in the state. Workers and pensioners are being paid their monthly salaries and entitlements as at when due.</p>
      <p>“Communities are living in peace and property developers have been freed from the obnoxious activities of the so-called CDA. Investors are leveraging on the new economic climate in the state and many more good things are happening.</p>
      <p>“We say no to godfatherism; we say no to political bickering; we say no to thuggery and pull him down syndrome.”</p>
