      <h1>Alleged cybercriminal extradited from Ukraine for stealing millions from US financial accounts</h1>

      <p>While Ukraine has dominated <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/impeachment-witnesses-say-foreign-research-on-opponents-not-appropriate/">impeachment talks in Washington</a> this past week, an alleged cybercriminal operating in Ukraine who siphoned off millions from US financial accounts over an 8-year span has been extradited to the US to face federal charges.</p>
      <p>Vytautas Parfionovas, 32, a Lithuanian national, was arraigned in Brooklyn federal court on Thursday on charges of money laundering and aggravated identity theft, the US Attorney’s Office in Brooklyn announced.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say that Parfionovas and co-conspirators who are unnamed in court documents, ran a variety of schemes from 2011 to 2018 that caused some $5.5 million in losses to their victims, including stealing the passwords to brokerage accounts and making trades for their own benefit.</p>
      <p>In another scheme, Parfionovas and the co-defendants got their hands on victims’ email accounts and sent requests to banks for overseas wire transfers — in one instance obtaining $50,000 from US investment accounts.</p>
      <p>“The world has become a much smaller place with the advent of the internet, and with that shrinking globe, the days of cyber criminals thinking because they’re not in our country they can escape justice are over,” FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William Sweeney said in a news release.</p>
      <p>Parfionovas, who was arrested in Ukraine on Oct. 24 and shipped to the US on Nov. 21, has yet to be arraigned on the charges. His lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, declined to comment.</p>
