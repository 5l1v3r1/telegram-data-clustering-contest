      <h1>‘Peace prayer’: Muslim choir from restive Thai south to sing for pope</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T02:52:11+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 02:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/AFP" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Gripped by nervous excitement, young Muslim singers from Thailand’s conflict-plagued south gather for choir practice ahead of a performance of a lifetime — for Pope Francis himself, who is in Bangkok as part of his whirlwind Asia tour.</p>
      <p>Wearing headscarves and school uniforms, students assembled in a university auditorium to practice ballads specially written for the pontiff, who arrived in Bangkok Wednesday for a four-day visit.</p>
      <p>But for some of the singers, the performance was about more than just hitting the right notes.</p>
      <p>It offers a rare chance for them to show a different side of a region that often makes headlines for a conflict that has killed more than 7,000 people, mostly Muslim and Buddhist followers.</p>
      <p>“We’re trying to say that we are not fundamentalists,” said 15-year-old Furkon Tasa.</p>
      <p>He is the student leader of the 31-member Attarkia Islamiah Institute choir from Narathiwat, one of three southernmost provinces where a conflict simmers as shadowy Malay-Muslim militants fight for greater autonomy.</p>
      <p>The clashes are characterised by tit-for-tat attacks that usually target symbols of the Thai state and its security forces.</p>
      <p>Furkon says the songs are a chance to show that people from different faiths can be united.</p>
      <p>“With music, we can sing and communicate with anyone,” he told AFP.</p>
      <p>His choir will perform for the Pope on Friday at Chulalongkorn University, joined by a group of ethnic Christian minorities and the resident concert choir.</p>
      <p>They all held a full rehearsal together for the first time Thursday, singing “Peace Prayer” and “Songs of Freedom”, both composed specifically for Francis.</p>
      <p>The Pope has made religious harmony a main theme of his visit to the Buddhist-majority country, the first papal trip since 1984. He is due to stay in Thailand until Saturday, when he will head to Japan.</p>
      <p>While the students acknowledged a conflict that has worsened over the past 15 years, they also expressed concern it had created an entirely negative picture of their homes.</p>
      <p>“We are Muslims. We are here to spread love,” said Arisa Mamat, 17.</p>
      <p>The idea for the joint performance came after the students, who had previously sung in royal ceremonies, met the Christian singers at a competition.</p>
      <p>Attarkiah school manager Phaisan Toryib said it was also a good chance for the Muslim singers to mingle with Thais from other faiths and express themselves.</p>
      <p>“Now they have a space to show who they are,” he said.</p>
