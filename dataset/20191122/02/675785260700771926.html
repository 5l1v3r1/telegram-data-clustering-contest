      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T02:37:42+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 02:37</time> by <a rel="author">Jilly Beattie, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jilly-beattie/</a></address>
      <p>A taxi driver from Northern Ireland has set off on a 1,700 mile journey to pick up a regular customer - who was injured in Benidorm.</p>
      <p>Phil Hamilton is on his way to the Spanish town after his pal Jim Moore suffered a head injury while on holiday last week.</p>
      <p>Jim, 58, was declared missing for 72 hours after going on a punters' club break, <a href="https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/belfast-news/taxi-leaves-newtownabbey-pick-up-17297040">Belfast Live reports.</a></p>
      <p>Friends set up a search party and social media campaign to try to track him down, and Jim was eventually found in a hospital being treated for a serious head injury following a fall.</p>
      <p>Now Phil, from 365 Taxis out of Newtownabbey, County Antrim, has agreed to turn off his meter in order to get Jim back to Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>And a number of friends and the taxi firm have clubbed together to cover the costs of the journey which is expected to take days.</p>

      <p>Driver/manager Phil said: "It's just the right thing to do. Jim is out of danger but he has been advised by the medical team not to fly for a few months, so this is the best way to get him home.</p>
      <p>"He has spent time in a Spanish hospital on his own separated from friends and family and now we'll get him in the car and we can have a good chat on the way back. I'll be driving myself but the family are keeping me company.</p>
      <p>"It's about 1,700 miles to Benidorm so we've left Newtownabbey and are getting the ferry to Scotland and then we'll drive on down to Benidorm.</p>

      <p>"I might just leave the sign on for a laugh for Jim to see, but the meter is off.</p>
      <p>"It was such a relief to hear that Jim had been found after he'd been missing, and even better news that he's out of danger now.</p>
      <p>"Jim is a regular customer of 365 taxis, and when we heard he was unable to travel by air we decided we'd send a taxi out to Spain to bring him back to Newtownabbey to reunite him with his family and friends.</p>
      <p>"I can't wait until the next fare I get asks me, 'What's the longest taxi journey you have done?', to see their face when I say it was a waiting return from Newtownabbey to Benidorm and back.‚Äù</p>

      <p>A spokesperson for 365 Taxis said: "He can't fly for a few months and he just wants to get home to his family.</p>
      <p>"So we are sending a taxi. It's fair to say here at 365 Taxis we really are more than just a taxi company. Phil should arrive in Benidorm on Saturday or Sunday to pick up his passenger and we wish them all well."</p>
