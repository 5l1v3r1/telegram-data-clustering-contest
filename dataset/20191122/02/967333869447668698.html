      <p>Trump was quick to tout his wealth and “clean” financial record in a Thursday Twitter thread, arguing that the supposed probing of his finances by former special counsel Robert Mueller while Mueller was looking into non-existent Russian collusion backed him up and should also <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911181077343856-us-supreme-court-temporarily-blocks-ruling-requiring-handover-of-trump-tax-records---order/">absolve him of further financial investigations</a>.</p>

      <p>In addition to the Mueller report having made no mention of Trump’s personal finances, Trump’s argument appeared a little off, considering the fact that he repeatedly said that he could only assume Mueller’s team examined his finances back in April.</p>
      <p>While Trump concluded his tax-related tirade with a mention of jobs, the Job Quality Index, which measures “higher-wage/higher-hour jobs versus lower-wage/lower-hour jobs,” currently stands at 80.62%. This means that, despite the low unemployment rate, for every 100 lower-wage/lower-hour jobs, there are approximately 81 jobs on the other end of the spectrum - which probably explains a recent survey that found <a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/201911151077319813-two-thirds-of-americans-struggle-financially-despite-low-unemployment---study/">70% of Americans struggle with financial stability</a>.</p>
