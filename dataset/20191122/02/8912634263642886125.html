      <p>German high-end carmaker has BMW said that it was massively increasing orders of battery cells for electric cars for the coming decade, as it plans dozens of new electrified models.</p>
      <p>The total increase of €6.2 billion ($6.9 billion) will come from a new €2.9-billion contract with Samsung-SDI and an increase from €4 billion to €7.3 billion in orders from China’s CATL, BMW said in a statement.</p>
      <p>German carmakers have been squeezed by years of emissions scandals and imminent tougher greenhouse gas rules in Europe into making big bets on electric mobility.</p>
      <p>BMW said that Thursday’s announcement “secures long-term battery cell needs” for the company, adding that it was itself organizing supplies of raw materials cobalt and lithium to the cell makers.</p>
      <p>“Compliance with environ- mental standards and respect for human rights have the highest priority” in sourcing the vital elements from Australia and Morocco, BMW said.</p>
      <p>By 2023, the group plans to offer 25 “electrified” models including hybrids and full battery-electric vehicles.</p>
      <p>The first all-electric Mini compact cars are to roll off its Oxford, UK line later this year.</p>
      <p>And it expects to double electric sales by 2021, followed by a “steep growth curve” of 30 percent annual expansion until 2025.</p>
      <p>Lithium-ion cells are the building blocks of the massive batteries built into electric and hybrid vehicles.</p>
      <p>But few carmakers have taken the huge financial risk of building up in-house production, as volumes remain low compared with combustion engines and the technology is swiftly developing.</p>
      <p>Rather, they prefer to farm out the battery work to specialist suppliers.</p>
      <p>About two thirds of cell-making capacity is in China, with giant CATL alone accounting for one quarter of global supply.</p>
      <p>Japan’s Panasonic, China’s BYD and Korea’s LG-Chem and Samsung-SDI round out the top five manufacturers.</p>
      <p>Some of the companies are expanding into Europe, with CATL building a factory in Erfurt, capital of the German state of Thuringia, that will initially supply BMW.</p>
      <p>But Paris and Berlin hope government backing can help found an “Airbus of batteries” to take on Asian competitors, with planned investments of between €5 billion and €6 billion — €4 billion to come from the private sector.</p>
