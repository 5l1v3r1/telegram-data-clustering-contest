      <p>Just a couple of hours back, we <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/tesla-cybertruck-launch/">reported</a> that Tesla is finally taking the wraps off its much anticipated Cybertruck. Now, Tesla’s official account has confirmed that the launch is scheduled for 8 PM PT today.</p>
      <p>As usual, the launch of the Cybertruck will be live-streamed online. Unfortunately, neither Tesla nor Elon Musk has shared the live stream details but the official Tesla account confirmed a live stream of the launch. <s>We will be updating the article as soon as the details of the live stream are available.</s></p>

      <p>Elon Musk teased that the Cybertruck will be the official truck for Mars. The same tweet also confirmed that the company will be building a pressurized edition of the truck which will be used on Mars.</p>

      <p>Musk had earlier said the truck will look like an <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/elon-musk-says-their-long-awaited-electric-truck-will-look-like-an-armored-personnel-carrier-from-the-future/">armoured personnel carrier from the future</a>. He has also said it will feature a 400-500 mile range, dual-motor all-wheel-drive drive train and dynamic suspension, and “300,000 lbs of towing capacity,” and will cost less than $50,000 and “be better than a Ford F150.” Musk promised their truck would be “a better sports car than a standard Porsche 911”, as well as a “better truck than a Ford F-150 in terms of truck-like functionality.” Elon Musk has been open about his dream of going to Mars and it looks like Cybertruck is just another step to fulfil his dream.</p>
      <p>The Tesla Cybertruck Launch will be in Los Angeles near the SpaceX rocket factory at 8 PM PT (11 PM ET or 4 AM UTC). We will update the article once the live-stream details have been shared.</p>
      <p><b>Update:</b> Tesla’s Twitter account has posted the link to watch the live stream of the launch. The event will be live-streamed on <a href="https://livestream.tesla.com/">livestream.tesla.com</a>.</p>
