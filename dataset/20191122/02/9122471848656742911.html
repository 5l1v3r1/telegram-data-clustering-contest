      <h1>Video: DeAndre Hopkins Just Made A Ridiculous Sideline Catch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T02:21:05+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 02:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>DeAndre Hopkins has a knack for making ridiculous catches – so much so, he’s starting to make them look normal. Hopkins once again showed off his elite skill-set on Thursday Night Football against the Colts.</p>
      <p>Houston moved the ball to midfield late in the first quarter. On 3rd-and-6, Deshaun Watson slung a bullet to Hopkins towards the sideline. The elite wideout hauled the pass in and attempted to keep both feet in bounds with a toe tap.</p>
      <p>At first glance, it seemed there was no way Hopkins kept both feet in bounds and made the catch for a first down. But sure enough on replay review, Hopkins secured the pass and kept both feet in bounds.</p>
      <p>There’s a reason Hopkins is labeled as one of the top receivers in the NFL.</p>

      <p>Hopkins’s ridiculous catch continued Houston’s drive which led to a field goal to take a 3-0 lead early in the contest. Any points matter in this type of divisional rivalry game.</p>
      <p>The Texans and Colts both hold 6-4 records, but Indianapolis is in first place due to their Week 7 win over Houston. But if Hopkins and the Texans can come away victorious tonight, they’ll take the AFC South Division lead and move to 7-4.</p>
      <p>You can catch the rest of the Texans-Colts game on FOX and NFL Network.</p>
