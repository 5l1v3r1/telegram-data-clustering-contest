      <p>“The minimum objective this season is to improve day by day. We want to win every game. The objective is qualifying for the Champions League,” Zaniolo told Sky Sport Italia.</p>
      <p>“I’m very happy, Roma have given me so much confidence, now I’ll repay it on the pitch. I’m proud to represent these fans, I feel very good here.</p>
      <p>“The things Fonseca has to say, he says to your face. He’s a very direct person and he’s helping me improve.”</p>
      <p>Zaniolo scored a brace in Italy’s 9-1 demolition of Armenia in Euro 2020 qualifying on Monday.</p>
