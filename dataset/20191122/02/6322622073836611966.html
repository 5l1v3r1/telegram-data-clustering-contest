      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 22): The FBM KLCI remained below the 1,600-point level at mid-morning today as domestic investor sentiment stayed edgy.</p>
      <p>At 10am, the FBM KLCI fell 2.25 points to 1,589.94.</p>
      <p>Losers led gainers by 289 to 217, while 299 counters traded unchanged. Volume was 629.1 million shares valued at RM314.99 million.</p>
      <p>The decliners included Nestle (M) Bhd, Hong Leong Bank Bhd, Sarawak Oil Palms Bhd, Genting Plantations Bhd, Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd, Public Bank Bhd and UWC Bhd.</p>
      <p>The actives included Ekovest Bhd, Sapura Energy Bhd, Perdana Petroleum Bhd, Bumi Armada Bhd, Pintaras Jaya Bhd, Daya Materials Bhd, Iskandar Waterfront City Bhd and KNM Group Bhd.</p>
      <p>The gainers included IGB Bhd, Scientex Bhd, MBM Resources Bhd, Teck Guan Perdana Bhd, Mi Technovation Bhd, Batu Kawan Bhd and Petronas Gas Bhd.</p>
      <p><i>Reuters </i>reported that Asian equities rose on Friday, bouncing from a three-week low touched a day earlier, but gains were capped by persistent worries over the status of trade negotiations between China and the United States.</p>
      <p>Early in the Asian trading day, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.12%. The index had fallen as much as 1.41% on Thursday, hitting its lowest level since Oct 30, on concerns that US legislation on Hong Kong threatened to undermine trade talks between the world's two largest economies, it said.</p>
      <p>Hong Leong IB Research said in wake of an overbought market, the Dow is likely to remain event-driven in the near term until an agreement can finally be reached by the US and China.</p>
      <p>"Nevertheless, any pullback is likely to be cushioned near 27,300-27,500 amid recent positive economic data and upbeat US 3Q19 reporting season. Key resistances are located at 28,200-28,500 levels," it said.</p>
      <p>On the local front, the research house said it expects sentiment to remain edgy amid the ongoing November reporting season and the US-China trade deal uncertainty.</p>
      <p>"Following recent breakdown below 1,600 psychological support, KLCI is envisaged to extend its consolidation on technical weakness but traditional window-dressing activities in December [are] likely to lend some support to the KLCI.</p>
      <p>"Key supports are near 1,573-1,585 whilst resistances are located at 1,610-1,633 levels," it said.</p>
