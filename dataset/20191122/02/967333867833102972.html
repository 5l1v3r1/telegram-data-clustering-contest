        <b>US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a short-term spending bill to stop the US government from shutting down, buying the Trump administration more time to negotiate billions of dollars in funding for the US-Mexico border wall.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The short-term spending bill, which is also known as a continuing resolution, was signed by Trump just hours before a deadline that would have caused federal agencies to shut down.</p>
      <blockquote>However, the bill will only allow the government to continue running until December 20, after which the White House and Congress will have to reach a decision regarding government funding for construction of the border wall to avoid a government shutdown.</blockquote>
      <p>Trump's stop-gap spending bill comes after the US House of Representatives passed a <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911201077353551-us-house-votes-to-keep-federal-government-open-until-20-december/">temporary funding measure</a> on Tuesday to keep the US government open for an additional month beyond the November 21 deadline.</p>
      <p>Congress must pass 12 annual appropriations bills to fund US military and federal agencies. However, a partisan divide between Republicans and Democrats in Congress has prevented lawmakers from agreeing on the bills needed to fund the government in Fiscal Year 2020.</p>
