      <h1>Lian Li’s Newest Case, The Lancool II, Is Mid-Tower Case Under $100</h1>

      <p>Lian Li, a well-known case manufacturer, has just announced the <a href="https://fave.co/2OBs7F0">Lancool II</a>, or the LANCOOL II, what's odd about this case is the side panel hinges and design, normally under $100 mid-tower cases are focused more on functionality rather than aesthetics. The Lancool II has both the functionality of other mid-tower cases and is, mostly, aesthetically pleasing.</p>
      <h3>The Lancool II is a mid-tower case with the design of a high-end case for just under $100.</h3>
      <p>The Lancool II is currently on sale at Newegg.com, the color of this white variant is stated as the <a href="http://bit.ly/37sfsga">Alpine White</a> and costs $94.99, the <a href="http://bit.ly/2OyyWqX">Black variant</a> is set at the price of $89.99. The black variant is set to release on December 10th while the white variant is releasing on December 19th. I wouldn't pre-order this case as of yet because of Black Friday deals which might discount some other cases very heavily.</p>
