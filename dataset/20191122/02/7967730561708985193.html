      <h1>Directors of embattled Prospa buy shares ahead of AGM vote</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T02:34:42+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 02:34</time> by <a rel="author">Colin Kruger</a></address>
      <p>The three Prospa non-executive directors facing re-election at next week's annual meeting, including chairman Gail Pemberton, have been buying up shares in the company amid a stock rout triggered by the small business lender's disastrous profit downgrade on Monday.</p>
      <p>With the share price down 46 per cent in four days and close to half its June IPO price, an ASX release on Friday reported that Ms Pemberton had acquired $100,000 worth of shares on Tuesday - the day after the company announced it would miss its prospectus earnings guidance by 60 per cent.</p>
      <p>Fellow board members Fiona Trafford-Walker and Avid Eyal have picked up more than $400,000 worth of shares between them since the downgrade.</p>

      <p>Company founder and co-chief executive Beau Bertoli also dipped in, buying $76,000 worth of shares on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
      <p>The stock, which was trading above the $5 mark in September, jumped 7 per cent higher to $2.15 this afternoon.</p>

      <p>The company remains closely held by foundation investors such as Airtree Ventures and company insiders like co-founder Greg Moshal, and his cousin Martin Moshal who own 63 per cent of the issued shares.</p>
      <p>Following the forecast downgrade Macquarie cut its price target by 35 per cent to $3.40 and UBS slashed its price target from $5.15 to $3.10.</p>
      <p>UBS maintained its "buy" recommendation on the stock, saying “we do not believe the model is broken” but warned Prospa “may need a sustained period of strong operating performance before investor confidence returns.”</p>
      <p>The broker said it was surprising that it took until November to realise that the half-year performance was well behind prospectus forecasts.</p>
      <p>“We believe this downgrade highlights that Prospa has lower earnings visibility than we previously thought.”</p>
