      <p>"Allowing children to get married at a young age can trigger a bigger social problem, which is now being referred to as paedophile crime," the female netizen wrote.<br/><br/>"I do not want to live in a state or country that gives these criminals a chance to commit such crimes."</p>
      <h4>Residents of other states soon followed suit</h4>
      <p>A Twitter user from Negeri Sembilan tweeted to say that she was inspired by the actions of the netizens.﻿<br/><br/>"You inspired me to do the same but if you don’t mind, I copied your words to send an email to the Negeri Sembilan Chief Minister!" a netizen <a href="https://twitter.com/haranimsa/status/1196863390922133504">replied</a> to a tweet.</p>
