      <h1>Why Jackson Browne Overcame His Reluctance to Write Movie Songs for '5B'</h1>
      <h2>TheWrap Oscar magazine: “I found it easier than I thought,” Browne admits of the song he co-wrote for the documentary about the early says of the AIDS epidemic</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T02:32:45+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 02:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/steve-pond/" target="_blank">Steve Pond</a></address>

        <i>A version of this story about Jackson Browne and “5B” first appeared in <a href="https://view.flipdocs.com/?ID=10004691_410902">The Race Begins issue</a> of TheWrap’s Oscar magazine.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Originally, veteran singer-songwriter Jackson Browne turned down the idea of writing a song for “5B,” the documentary by Paul Haggis and Dan Krauss about the nurses and doctors who served in the first AIDS ward in San Francisco in the 1980s.</p>
      <p>“I initially said I didn’t have the time to do this, and normally I don’t willingly sign on to something like this,” he said. “I’ve written songs for movies before, and it can be a very long process for me to get something I like. So I pretty much said no, and he said, ‘Well, I’ll be hoping your time opens up. You’re still my first choice.”</p>
      <p>But Browne found the film very moving — “it fills in so much about our humanity, about each other’s humanity and about the fear that drives the controversy” — and Haggis got around his worries about time when he came back with a demo of a song written by Leslie Mendelson and Steve McEwan and sung by Mendelson. “I liked what I heard, but felt I could add something to it,” Browne said. “So I did. I found it easier than I thought.”</p>

      <p>Throughout his lengthy career, Browne has rarely written with others, and he’s rarely written quickly. “I’m somebody who takes forever, arguing with myself over whether to use this word or that word,” he said. “But this happened really quick, in an hour session together. It was fun to have somebody to talk to, to argue back or to give you feedback.”</p>
      <p>Browne was always conscious of the purpose the somber and beautiful duet would be serving in 5B. “It’s somewhat daunting, to write a song for the end credits of a movie,” he said. “It can’t be a recap of what you’ve seen. It can’t be redundant.”</p>
      <p>But he found that the song, a somber ballad sung as a duet between Mendelson and Browne, resonated with the movie while also working beyond the film. “It has to be about people and it has to travel outside the film,” he said of the song. “I think some of the lines that I added were really not about the film – they were about me, about my own feeling for someone else.</p>

      <p>“Steve and Leslie steered me away from any kind of polemic, anything that seemed vaguely like a tract. I added some stuff that made it really about the relationship between two people.”</p>
      <p>And in the end, he said, he was both surprised by how quickly the song was written and touched by what the process came up with. “I love the line, ‘I say it’s how we’re made,’ which I think really speaks to the whole debate about sexuality,” he said. “And the words ‘Sometimes all anybody needs is a human touch’ are so universal and so true.”</p>

          <figcaption>The new movie "Yesterday" imagines what it would be like if no one had ever heard of The Beatles, and as one woman says in the film, "the world is a worse place without The Beatles music in it." But several great films would also be worse off without the songs of the Fab Four. That said, Beatles songs are expensive, and only so many films have managed to hit that perfect note. And to make this list manageable, we're excluding movies that exclusively use Beatles songs like "Across the Universe," "I Am Sam" as well as The Beatles own movies "A Hard Day's Night," "Help!" and "Yellow Submarine."<cite>Paramount/Universal/Paramount Vantage/EMI</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"<a href="https://youtu.be/TgGqdAAyJSQ">Once Upon a Time in America</a>" (1984) - "Yesterday"<br/></b>In this wistful moment in Sergio Leone's sprawling epic "Once Upon a Time in America," Robert De Niro plays a gangster leaving New York to the sound of an old fashioned, Ennio Morricone score, only to return years later as a now worn old man. As he steps back into 1960s New York to look back on the memories of his former life, Morricone's score blends into a rendition of "Yesterday" that is as forlorn as the movie itself.<cite>Warner Bros.</cite></figcaption>

It's a movie moment and song so fun that it inspires the entire city to spontaneously get up and dance or even cartwheel through the air.<cite>Paramount</cite></figcaption>

"Now youse guys can't leave," Chazz Palminteri's mobster character Sonny says to a biker gang as he locks them in his bar. After one fighter smashes into the jukebox, the song changes and the heavy violence of the scene sinks in.<cite>Universal Pictures</cite></figcaption>

But the smaller in scope orchestration doesn't change the sweeping, inspiring quality of the melody, which fits Anderson's tone beautifully.<cite>Touchstone Pictures</cite></figcaption>

It's a biting, cynical line as David Fincher slowly brings it in before the credits of his millennial masterpiece "The Social Network," with Mark Zuckerberg endlessly refreshing his Facebook page to see if his ex-girlfriend will accept his friend request.<cite>Columbia Pictures</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Not Fade Away" (2012) - "I Want to Hold Your Hand"<br/></b>"The Sopranos" creator David Chase said that with "Not Fade Away" he wanted to make "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/21/movies/not-fade-away-directed-by-david-chase.html">a biopic about nobody</a>," a film that encapsulated the ambitious people you never heard of and that heard the life-changing music of The Beatles and were changed forever, even if their circumstances ultimately didn't. "What is that?" the film's lead plainly says when he hears "I Want to Hold Your Hand" for the first time. Other films have used the Beatles' Ed Sullivan show appearance and given the scene a lot more fanfare, but for Chase, that revelation has a far different feeling. <cite>Paramount Vantage</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Yesterday" (2019) - "Help!"<br/></b>One of the best moments in "Yesterday" comes as the film's protagonist Jack Malik is launching his album to the world with a special rooftop concert. But as he's overwhelmed with stress and pressure from his family, his label and the woman he loves, he takes to the stage and plays a roaring, punk version of John Lennon's "Help." As the song closes, Jack screams "help me" in agony, punctuating Lennon's mournful lyrics on an otherwise upbeat pop-rock song.<cite>Universal Pictures</cite></figcaption>
