      <h1>Megan Thee Stallion And Trey Songz Get Cozy During Night Out After She Denies Dating Tristan Thompson – See The Vid!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T02:19:07+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 02:19</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Markus</a></address>
      <p>After rumors that she and Tristan Thompson were dating, Megan Thee Stallion is now romantically linked to Trey Songz! Apparently, the two were seen out and about and things got pretty flirty between them!</p>
      <p>Their late night outing happened on November 20 and they were getting quite cozy at a club.</p>
      <p>One eyewitness report claims they stayed in front of the DJ booth so they were not hard to notice.</p>
      <p>In a clip captured during that cozy outing, Trey kept his arm around Megan’s waist for quite some time as they would lean in to talk to each other over the loud music.</p>
      <p>And that was not all! Since they were at a club, dancing just had to happen so, at some point, Megan dropped it low in front of Trey who looked like he really enjoyed the show she was putting on for him.</p>

      <p>The dating rumors about them come only a day after she took to her platform of choice, Twitter, to deny speculations that she was dating someone else – Khloe Kardashian’s baby daddy, Tristan Thompson!</p>
      <p>In fact, she sounded pretty baffled as well as upset by the seemingly random rumor.</p>
      <p>‘What In the f**k are you talking about. I wish y’all would stop making s**t up I don’t even know that n***a,’ she tweet responded to a follower suggesting she and the basketball player had spent the night together following his game on November 18.</p>
      <p>Obviously, she was very clear that there was nothing going on between Tristan and her but she did hint at Trey being her new boo.</p>
      <p>In fact, the two of them even spent Halloween together and looked like they had the time of their lives!</p>
      <p>The man appeared on her IG Stories at a party on October 30.</p>
      <p>One clip showed him just lounging on a bed before noticing the camera was on him and turning to flash a smile in its direction.</p>
