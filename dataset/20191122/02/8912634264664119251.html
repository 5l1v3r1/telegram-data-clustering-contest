      <p>MADRID: Novak Djokovic defeated Benoit Paire 6-3, 6-3 to seal Serbia’s victory over top-ranked France in the Davis Cup Finals on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The result gave Serbia an insurmountable 2-0 lead over the French before the doubles match. Filip Krajinovic had defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-5, 7-6 (5) in the first singles to mathematically secure Serbia in the last eight of the revamped<br/>team competition.</p>
      <p>Djokovic had a break in the first set and two in the second to clinch his 14th straight Davis Cup<br/>singles victory.</p>
      <p>“I made some crucial breaks at the right time in both sets,” Djokovic said. “It’s tough to play Benoit, he is a very talented guy, very unpredictable.”</p>
      <p>Serbia secured first place in Group A by winning every tie without dropping a set.</p>
      <p>Group winners advance to the knockout stage along with the two best second-place finishers among the six groups.</p>
      <p>Britain and Kazakhstan were 1-1 after Kyle Edmund defeated Mikhail Kukushkin 6-3, 6-3 and Alexander Bublik evened the match for Kazakhstan by beating Daniel Evans 5-7, 6-4, 6-1.</p>
      <p>The winner will clinch a place in the last eight as the first-placed team in Group E.</p>
      <p>Britain were not playing Andy Murray, who on Wednesday came from behind to win his match against Tallon Griekspoor in<br/>three sets.</p>
      <p>In Group C, Germany were leading Chile 1-0 after Phillip Kohlschreiber defeated Nicolas Jarry 6-4, 6-3.</p>
