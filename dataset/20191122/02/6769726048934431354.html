      <p>Over the coming weeks there will be many offers to launch the Highgate store, including a $1 burger day on Saturday, November 30.</p>
      <p>Owner Zoe Tsagalis said Beaufort Street has had its share of negativity lately but they strongly believed the location and history of the strip would always retain its appeal.</p>
      <p>“We love the neighbourhood and are excited to share the block with Mary Street Bakery, The Queens, El Publico and The Must Wine Bar,” she said.</p>
      <p>“The Huxtaburger brand is synonymous with the Melbourne food culture. Each store has its own personality and becomes part of the local neighbourhood.</p>
      <p>“I have loved the product for a long time and I know that when Dom travels to Melbourne he often drops into the Collingwood store for a burger, so we jumped at the opportunity to join the business.”</p>

      <p>Huxtaburger started in Melbourne by three food lovers, including Master Chef guest Daniel Wilson and Dante Ruaine.</p>
      <p>The brand has expanded with stores across Melbourne, Sydney and Perth.</p>
      <p>Its first WA location opened at Hibernian Place, Perth in April 2018.</p>
