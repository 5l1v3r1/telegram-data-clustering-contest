      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- The <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/New-York-Yankees/?tps=1">New York Yankees</a> released oft-injured <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jacoby_Ellsbury/?tps=1">Jacoby Ellsbury</a> and designated first baseman Greg Bird for assignment.</p>
      <p>The Yankees <a href="https://twitter.com/Yankees/status/1197323593530716161">announced</a> the roster moves Wednesday. Ellsbury had more than $26 million left in his seven-year, $153 million contract that he signed with the club in December 2013.</p>
      <p>The club will owe Ellsbury over $21 million for next season, along with a $5 million buyout of a $21 million team option for 2021.</p>
      <p>Ellsbury, who hasn't played with the Yankees since 2017 due to multiple injuries, was cut to clear a spot on the team's 40-man roster as New York added seven players to protect them from next month's Rule 5 draft.</p>
      <p>Ellsbury, a two-time World Series champion and 2011 All-Star choice, had a .264 batting average with 39 home runs, 198 RBIs and 102 stolen bases in 520 games across four seasons with the Yankees. The 36-year-old outfielder spent his first seven MLB seasons with the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Boston-Red-Sox/?tps=1">Boston Red Sox</a>.</p>
      <p>The Yankees designated Bird, 27, and left-hander Nestor Cortes Jr. for assignment. Bird joined the club in 2015 and finished the season with 11 home runs and 31 RBIs in 46 games.</p>
      <p>Bird then missed the entire 2016 campaign after undergoing surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder. Multiple injuries forced him to sit out large portions of the next three seasons.</p>
      <p>The Yankees added outfielder Estevan Florial to the major league roster, along with right-handed pitchers Deivi Garcia, Luis Gil, Brooks Kriske, Luis Medina, Nick Nelson and Miguel Yajure.</p>
