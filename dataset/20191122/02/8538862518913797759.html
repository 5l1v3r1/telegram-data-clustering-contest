      <p><b>Update:</b> Adding further fuel to the fire, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/resident-evil-3-remake-to-release-in-2020/">VGC</a> has reported that it's been told by a "number of sources" that a Resident Evil 3: Nemesis remake is in production and is scheduled for release next year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-22-sources-resident-evil-3-remake-in-development">Eurogamer</a> then corroborates the news by stating it has also heard word of the project. "Sources close to its development suggest it has been in development for some time".</p>

      <p><b>Original Article:</b> A remake of <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/psone/resident_evil_3_nemesis">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a> has been <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/04/is_capcom_teasing_a_resident_evil_3_remake">rumoured</a> since the successful release of <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/resident_evil_2">Resident Evil 2</a> earlier this year, but it looks like an announcement could be imminent. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksBrLDX8SCM">Spawn Wave</a> – who’s been credited with leaking multiple titles, including <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/elden_ring">Elden Ring</a> – claims that a revival of the PSone survival horror is in-development at Capcom, and is targeting a release next year.</p>
      <p>Assuming that intended 2020 date is accurate, an announcement could be imminent – perhaps as early as at <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/tags/the-game-awards">The Game Awards</a> next month. It’ll be interesting to see which platforms this project is aiming for, because while the PlayStation 4 is almost guaranteed, there’s a strong possibility it may nab a PlayStation 5 version, too. That is dependent on this all turning out to be true, of course.</p>
