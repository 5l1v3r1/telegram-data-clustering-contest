      <p>TEENAGE girls take note: we have some of Australia's best female cricketers set for a derby right in our backyard.</p>
      <p>We are a Renegades city but definitely worth noting Melbourne Stars' boast a wealth of talent, like veteran bat Elyse Villani, set to play at Eastern Oval on Saturday.</p>
      <p>We are once again reminded the harsh reality about nine in 10 Australian teenage girls are not getting enough physical activity each week, thanks to a World Health Organisation report released on Friday. Australia has some of the least active teenagers in Western countries.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Girls, you want some inspiration - here it is.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Women's Big Bash League action is a chance to think bigger. This is a chance to consider sports or recreation activity that may have long been outside the traditional realms accessible to females.</p>
      <p>Even a decade ago, there was female cricket about and there were pathways in the game. But nothing like WBBL and the tone it helping to set in women's sport now.</p>
      <p>Until you get to a game and watch our WBBL athletes up close, it is hard to comprehend how hard these women hit the ball or how frightening fast and accurate they can strike when they bowl.</p>

      <p>Cricket has been a key game working to change culture and opportunities at a grassroots level in Ballarat. Our growing junior girls competition was <a href="https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/5313229/edgy-power-play-to-move-more-ballarat-women-kick-down-stereotypes/">one major reason Sport England's chief Jennie Price put Ballarat on her whirlwind itinerary</a> two years ago.</p>
      <p>Price wanted to gauge barriers to play for women and girls in regional Victoria and was keen to see how Ballarat Cricket Association's competition was smashing these barriers.</p>
      <p>Cricket has been a leading example in Ballarat for offering greater opportunity both in adapting the game, like Social Sixers, and developing junior and senior programs for women.</p>
      <p>Ballarat Bolts is the city's first modern standalone women's cricket club and is set for a Twenty20 final in Melbourne on Sunday in Cricket Victoria Women's Community Cricket Competition. Bolts claimed this title in their division last season.</p>
      <p>Ahead of their second season, starting last month, Bolts coach Jeremy Byrne said the biggest thing blocking women from getting involved in cricket was anxiety of joining a new team or unfamiliar sport - women know the game but might not have had much chance to play it.</p>
      <p>"We've generally found once the girls get down and meet the rest of the party they get fairly comfortable," Byrne told <i>The Courier</i>.</p>

      <p>Sometimes is might be in knowing there is widespread support.</p>
      <p>More than 2,200 people turned out for the Renegades' Eastern Oval clash last season, despite stormy weather conditions. Most did not leave when rain started and covers were pulled.</p>

          <b>OPINION:</b>
          <a href="https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/6213381/pull-back-the-covers-were-ready-renegades-return-bigger-than-sport/"> Pull back the covers, we're ready for Renegades' return. This is bigger than a game | MELANIE WHELAN</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is an awesome response from men and women for the women's game.</p>
      <p>And there is more to come. Renegades and Stars land a fortnight ahead of Bendigo Spirit and Canberra Capitals playing the city's first in-season Women's National Basketball League clash at the new Ballarat Sports and Events Centre.</p>
      <p>Getting out on and supporting these game all helps change culture in women's sport. These matches are pivotal in encouraging girls what can be possible, and, most of all, fun.</p>
