      <p>South Korea media announced that Yoo Sang-chul was reported to have pancreatic cancer on Nov 19. Speaking with the Chosun Ilbo, Park could not hire his sadness.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Yoo Sang-chul is my old player. We worked together in World Cup 2002. Hong Muyng-bo once told about Yoo Sang-chul’s jaundice and adviced him to see doctor. I was shocked to hear about the cancer.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>It is bad. Yoo Sang-chul is too young in his bright coaching career ahead. The reality is grim but I will help him as much as possible. I tried not to cry but I really feel bad about this.”</i>
