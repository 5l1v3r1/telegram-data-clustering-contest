      <p>The Ormeau Christmas Carols has become the latest event on the Gold Coast to cancel their fireworks displays.</p>
      <p>It comes in the wake of the devastating bushfires currently raging in Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
      <p>“Due to the current dry weather conditions and fire bans across the State, the Ormeau Carols event organisers have cancelled the proposed Ormeau Carols fireworks finale on 8 December,” organisers said in a post on Facebook.</p>
      <p>Instead, Director of Ormeau Carols Kristieanne Smith said the carols will be donating to the Red Cross Bushfire Appeal.</p>
      <p>“The Ormeau Carols will be working with the community on the night to raise much needed funds for those affected by the recent fires,” she said.</p>
      <p>Gold Coast Deputy Mayor Donna Gates praised the organisers for their decision.</p>
      <p>“We urge everyone attending to spare a thought for those doing it tough and please give generously as a show of support,” Cr Gates said.</p>
      <p>“I’d also like to congratulate Highway Christian Church because the fireworks supplier will still be paid in full in recognition of great support over many years.”</p>
      <p>Instead of fireworks, special effect snow machines have been added to the show.</p>
      <p>The Ormeau Carols aren’t the first to scrap the fireworks display, with the Mayor’s Christmas Carols in Southport, Pacific Pines Carols and Twin Towns Carols all cancelling their fireworks shows due to the bushfire threat.</p>
      <p>“In recognition of the many Queenslanders and New South Wales residents battling catastrophic bushfires, the Twin Towns Board of Management voted to cancel the NYE fireworks at Jack Evans Boat Harbour and Club Banora,” Twin Towns said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“The Board’s decision took into consideration the dangers posed by fireworks to bush and grassland in the vicinity of the Clubs, as well as their responsibility to ensure life and property are not placed at risk.”</p>
      <p>Chairman Michael Fraser said the Board believes it feels like the right thing to do.</p>
      <p>“Bringing in the New Year without the bang will be a sentiment welcomed by many,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Watching the devastation across the country, and so close to home, made us reflect on how else we could recognise New Year’s Eve this year.</p>
      <p>“Lending a helping hand to victims of this tragedy is firmly on the Board’s agenda for 2020 and the $20,000 allocated for fireworks will instead be donated to bushfire appeals.”</p>
      <p>Families can still head to the border to see the New Year roll in with presentations on the hour, every hour on the big screen and LEDs on the Twin Towns building.</p>
      <p>“It will be like Times Square on the border,” Mr Fraser said.</p>
      <p>Organisers of other events on the Gold Coast, including the New Years Eve Fireworks in Surfers Paradise, are yet to make a call on whether or not they will be going ahead with fireworks.</p>
