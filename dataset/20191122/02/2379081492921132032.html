      <h1>Amid turbulence in the region, Peru places $3 bln worth of bonds - minister</h1>

      <p>LIMA — Peru on Thursday placed two local currency bonds equivalent to almost $3 billion amid a context of political and social turbulence in near-by South American countries, Economy Minister Maria Antonieta Alva told Reuters.</p>
      <p>One of the bonds was for 8,000 million soles ($2,375 billion) and is due in 2040. Another was a reopening of a bond due in 2034 of 2,000 million soles ($595 million), according to data from the ministry.</p>
      <p>The new 2040 bond had a coupon rate of 5.35% and the 2034 bond was reopened with a coupon of 4.95%.</p>
      <p>“We are very satisfied. The support for Peru has been very strong,” Alva said, in a telephone interview while closing the bond placement operation.</p>
      <p>Parts of South America have been rife with unrest for months, from Venezuela, to Ecuador to Chile.</p>
      <p>In neighboring Bolivia, supporters of president Evo Morales marched into the capital La Paz on Thursday carrying coffins of people killed in clashes with the military and police, drawing attention to the human cost of the crisis gripping that nation.</p>
      <p>“As everyone knows, in a deteriorating international context and some social tension in the region, this is a boost for Peru,” she said. (Reporting by Marco Aquino; Writing by Hugh Bronstein; Editing by Sandra Maler)</p>
