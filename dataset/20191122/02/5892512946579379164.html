      <h1>Weili Zhang will finish Joanna Jedrzejczyk early so she wont have to endure long periods of damage</h1>
      <h2>She’s a lethal striker with a kind heart.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T02:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 02:00</time> by <a rel="author">Adam Guillen Jr.</a></address>
      <p>Though not yet official, all signs point toward current Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) women’s Strawweight champion, Weili Zhang, defending her title against ex-division queen, Joanna Jedrzejczyk.</p>
      <p>At least the <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/18/20971281/ufc-weili-zhang-ready-calm-angry-joanna-jedrzejczyk-mma">trash talk has started early.</a></p>
      <p>Known for over-the top trash talk and staredowns, Joanna isn’t shy about being highly-emotional when it comes to hyping up a fight or taking care of business inside the Octagon, For Weili, though, all that’s going to do is get her in trouble once she sees her standing across the cage.</p>
      <p>“I think she sounds very angry all the time, and her emotions will get her in trouble,” Weili told <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/ufc-zhang-weili-explains-why-finish-joanna-jedrzejczyk-early">MMA Junkie</a>. “She is willing to fight me now, but there was a time she didn’t want to fight me, as well. I am ready anytime for battle. Just call my manager Mr. Brian (Butler) and the boss Dana, and we can fight next week.”</p>
      <p>Indeed, Joanna herself admitted to <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/9/18/20872049/ufc-joanna-jedrzejczyk-turned-down-weili-zhang-three-times-she-needed-me-mma">turning down Zhang on several occasions</a>. But now that Joanna has gotten back into the win column, it seems a title fight is next for her, because never mind the fact that there may be another more worthy contender waiting in the wings, such as undefeated (8-0, 5-0) Tatiana Suarez, who oh by the way is <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/19/20972220/latest-ufc-rankings-conor-mcgregor-continues-fade-shogun-rua-dropped-top-15-mma">ranked higher</a> than Jedrzejczyk.</p>
      <p>But since Dana White <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/19/20972747/dana-white-excited-about-very-fun-fight-between-weili-zhang-joanna-jedrzejczyk">seems stoked</a> about a potential title fight between Joanna and Zhang, Suarez will likely have to wait even longer. Should this fight come to pass, Zhang doesn’t envision it going too long, as she will try to take “JJ” out as quickly as possible to avoid having her take unnecessary punishment.</p>
      <p>“I am always looking to finish a fight as soon as I can so my opponent doesn’t have to endure long periods of damage,” Weili added. “I see the fight ending in one or two rounds. I think Joanna possesses great skill with her striking, along with good power, but I believe in my training and team to have me ready to beat her anywhere.”</p>
      <p>And if Joanna comes in with a chip on her shoulder, Zhang will be more than happy to help her with her anger issues. “I think she is very angry and emotional, and I will calm her down.”</p>
