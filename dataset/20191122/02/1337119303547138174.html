      <h1>Valve is bringing its Index VR headset to more countries</h1>
      <h2>Right in time for Half-Life: Alyx</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T02:23:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 02:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sam-byford" target="_blank">Sam Byford</a></address>
      <p>Right after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975423/half-life-alyx-vr-price-release-date-screenshots-trailer-valve-steam">announcing <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i></a>, already one of the most anticipated VR games of all time, Valve has confirmed plans to bring its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102584/valve-index-steamvr-headset-review-shipping-today">Index headset and controllers</a> to other countries, starting with Canada and Japan today. The $999 Index is already available in the US and Europe.</p>
      <p><i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> won’t require a Valve Index, but the company’s own VR headset is likely to provide the most high-end experience available. It’s also unclear to what degree the game might be optimized for Valve’s Index controllers, which offer better individual finger sensing than most competitors.</p>
      <p><i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> will be a free download for all Index owners, while people who buy the headset before the end of the year will get access to in-game cosmetic items and locations that can be explored through Steam VR Destinations.</p>
