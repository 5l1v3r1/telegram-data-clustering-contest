      <p>Earlier this month Bellata and Mallawa students headed off to the big city of Canberra.</p>
      <p>Ten Bellata and seven Mallawa students arrived in Canberra on Monday, November 4 and spent the week sightseeing and visiting the city's top attractions.</p>
      <p>During the excursion students visited old and new Parliament House, The Australian War Memorial, The Dinosaur Museum, The National Australian Museum, Questacon, The Royal Australian Mint, Telstra Towers, the Australian Institute of Sport and Glass Works.</p>

      <p>The students thoroughly enjoyed their week away, experiencing things many of them never had before.</p>
      <p>It was also a nice break for them away from the dusty, dry conditions they are all so used to.</p>
      <p>The excursion was made possible thanks to a Foundation For Rural And Regional Renewal (FRRR) grant.</p>
      <p>The Bellata P and C applied for the grant earlier this year due to the drought and hard times and were granted it in September.</p>
      <p>It helped some of the struggling families as they only had to pay a fraction of the cost, which was a massive relief and very much appreciated.</p>
