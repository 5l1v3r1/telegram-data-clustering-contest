      <p>WASHINGTON — Newly released documents show Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was in contact with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the months before the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was abruptly recalled.</p>
      <p>The State Department released the documents Friday to the group American Oversight, in response to a Freedom of Information lawsuit. They show that Pompeo talked with Giuliani on March 26 and March 29.</p>
      <p>Austin Evers, executive director of American Oversight, says the documents reveal “a clear paper trail from Rudy Giuliani to the Oval Office to Secretary Pompeo to facilitate Giuliani’s smear campaign against a U.S. ambassador.”</p>
      <p>Last week, former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch told House impeachment investigators she felt “kneecapped” by a “smear campaign” Giuliani led against her. She was withdrawn from her post in Ukraine in May.</p>
