      <p>The Benue Police Command on Friday confirmed the discovery of three corpses belonging to one family in their room situated in North-Bank area of Makurdi metropolis, <a href="http://concisenews.global/news">Concise News</a> reports.</p>
      <p>The State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Catherine Anene, who confirmed the bizarre happening to NAN in Makurdi, said investigations were ongoing to unravel the cause of death.</p>
      <p>The PPRO also disclosed that a little girl was found in the room where the dead bodies were discovered completely unhurt but too small to give useful information.</p>
      <p>She said that cause of death was still unknown but added that all dead bodies had no physical injuries to warrant an immediate determination of cause of death.</p>
      <p>She, therefore, appealed to members of the public with useful information on the “sad event” to report to the nearest security agencies for necessary action.</p>
      <p>“The incident was reported today (Friday) and when our men rushed to the scene we discovered three dead bodies: a man, his wife and son all dead, ” she said.</p>
      <p>Some of the neighbours described the deceased family members as ”peaceful” and wondered what could have happened.</p>
      <h3>Benue ANA urges patronage of state’s library</h3>
      <p>In related news, the Benue State chapter of the Association of Nigerian Authors (ANA) has called on the general public to patronise the state’s library.</p>
      <p>Chairman of the association, Dr. Charles Iornumbe, made the call on Thursday when he led other executive members on a familiarisation visit to the state’s library board in Makurdi.</p>
      <p>Iornumbe said though the library was in a deplorable condition, it could boast facilities such as operational computers for electronic library and books that could be useful to students and researchers at all levels of education.</p>
      <p>He expressed the readiness of Benue ANA to establish its presence at the state library like other chapters in the country in the area of book exhibition, promotion and reading.</p>
      <p>According to him, the chapter has received with joy moves by the state government to rehabilitate the library.</p>
      <p>He said the association was in touch with the Commissioner for Information, Culture, and Tourism, Mrs. Ngunan Addingi, for approval to establish its presence at the library, expressing happiness with the warm reception accorded the literary body so far.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the Director, Benue State Library Board, Mrs. Theresa Zamber, had expressed the readiness of the library board to partner ANA to promote books.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Zamber particularly urged ANA members to help the board to sensitise the populace on the need to patronise the library, saying that the state government was aware of the deplorable condition of the facility and was working towards overhauling it for optimal use.</p>
