      <p>SOLO, Indonesia: Three people have been killed by swarms of angry hornets in Indonesia over the past two weeks, a health agency official said on Friday (Nov 22).</p>
      <p>An 11-year-old student died in West Java Wednesday after he and three other pupils tried to destroy a nest of lesser banded hornets - a species notorious for its aggressive behaviour and a sting that can trigger a life-threatening allergic reaction.</p>

      <p>The fatal attack came after two elderly people were killed in hornet attacks this month in Central Java's Klaten city, which has seen a surge in victims.</p>
      <p>Seven people in the area were killed by hornet stings last year and hundreds more have been attacked over the past decade, according to local data.</p>
      <p>Several dozen health clinics across the city are on high alert for more victims, said Cahyo Widodo, head of Klaten's health agency.</p>
      <p>"All the health centres are now prepared to handle hornet attack cases," Widodo said.</p>
      <p>A group of volunteers are also going to locations where the hornets breed to destroy their nests.</p>
      <p>The species has been migrating to the area over the past few years, according to a local rescue agency official.</p>
      <p>Found across Southeast Asia, the multi-coloured hornet can grow up toÂ 30mm.</p>
