      <h1>Prepare for heatwave, LASEPA warns Lagosians</h1>

      <p>The Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency has advised Lagosians to guide against extreme heat by drinking lots of water.</p>
      <p>The General Manager of LASEPA, Dr Adedolapo Fasawe, in a statement on Thursday urged residents to ensure adequate ventilation at homes and offices in order to mitigate the intensity of the prevailing heatwave in the state.</p>
      <p>Fasawe also advised Lagosians to adequately prepare for the heat intensity associated with the dry season which had manifested globally as heatwaves with serious public health implications.</p>
      <p>She said that Lagos, being a highly urbanised city, had a higher risk of increased warming due to the heat.</p>
      <p>According to her, the effect is palpable where there is a high density of dark surfaces (concretes structures, paved roads and buildings) that absorb and emit more heat within a defined area.</p>
      <p>“High rate of fire and flooding incidents are some of the effects of heatwaves, and this underscores the need to desist from burning refuse, being a contributory factor to a high rate of heatwaves.</p>
      <p>“Other factors that contribute to heatwaves include the use of poorly-serviced generators and use of ozone-depleting materials, all of which add to greenhouse gas emissions,” she said.</p>
      <p>Fasawe urged Lagosians to engage in tree planting activities and greenery within their localities and environments, ensure that they were properly hydrated at all times and stay within well-ventilated areas.</p>
