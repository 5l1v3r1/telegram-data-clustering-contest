      <h1>Returning museum objects to former colonies risks 'denying Britain's history'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/patrick-sawer/" target="_blank">Patrick Sawer</a></address>
      <p>Edinburgh University’s decision to return a set of skulls to Sri Lanka has been criticised by historians who fear Britain’s museums risk being stripped of objects which are crucial in explaining to future generations this country’s place in the world.</p>
      <p>Some of the country’s most respected museum curators and antiquarians have expressed their concern over the growing number of artefacts and works of art being returned to countries from which campaigners say they were “stolen”.</p>
      <p>They fear that far from providing a just restitution of objects stolen from their countries of origin, returning works of art paradoxically risks denying <a href="https://chase.telegraph.co.uk/etc/telegraph-author/index.html#edit/2f616985-4c18-11e9-9102-06813a5dfefa">Britain's history as a former imperial power and coloniser.</a></p>
      <p>The writer and broadcaster Tiffany Jenkins, a former visiting fellow at the London School of Economics’s Department of Law and author of <i>Keeping Their Marbles</i>, told <i>The Telegraph</i>: "Museums should not be used for political battles, or for a contemporary culture war. A lot of people seem to think that by returning artifacts they can somehow atone for the past."</p>
      <p>The warnings came as Edinburgh University decided to return a set of nine 200-year-old human skulls to Sri Lanka, from where they were taken more than a century ago.</p>

      <p>The move follows an announcement by Manchester Museum that it is to restore 12 Aboriginal objects taken from Australia more than 100 years ago, including sacred ceremonial artefacts and a garment made with emu feathers.</p>
      <p>Visiting the museum last week Mangubadijarri Yanner, an indigenous leader, said the treasures had been "taken without our permission" by early 20th Century British colonialists.</p>
      <p>"The repatriation of our sacred cultural heritage items is a fundamental part of the healing and reconciliation process," Mr Yanner said.</p>
      <p>Stephen Welsh, curator of Living Cultures at Manchester Museum, described the collection as "a product of empire", originally built on "racial hierarchies, cultural hierarchies, social Darwinism".</p>
      <p>In his new book Who Owns History, the barrister Geoffrey Robertson QC accuses the British Museum of having “become the world’s largest receivers of stolen property,”, much of which is not even on display, and calls on it to return key artefacts, such as the Elgin Marbles.</p>
      <p>But Ms Jenkins said that many demands for the return of objects come not from their original countries but from western campaigners.</p>
      <p> "You need to ask who is doing the claiming and how many claims are actually made,” she said.</p>
      <p>She added:  "This idea of [artefacts] belonging to one culture is quite narrow. The Parthenon in Greece was once a temple, then a mosque. Culture is not ‘fixed’.”</p>
      <p>Ms Jenkins cites the Benin Bronzes, which though arguably stolen by the British when they invaded present day Nigeria, where themselves crafted as a result of the existing slave trade.</p>
      <p>Writing in the BBC’s History Magazine earlier this year she said: “It is not possible to repair that past. The best way to respect the lives of the people who came before us is to research and understand history without such an agenda.</p>
      <p>“We should aim to live in a world where artefacts from other times and places are shared. We should aim to unlock the past, not overturn it. That is what museums are for, and what they do best. That is why they should keep their treasures.”</p>
      <p>Tristram Hunt, the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, said museums should not “automatically bow to calls to return artworks plundered by 19th century colonisers”</p>
      <p>He said: “To decolonise is to decontextualise: the history of empire is embedded in its meaning and collections, and the question is how that is interpreted.”</p>
      <p>The former Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent added: “There remains something essentially valuable about the ability of museums to position objects beyond particular cultural or ethnic identities.”</p>
      <p>The British Museum said: "We believe the strength of the collection is its breadth and depth which allows millions of visitors an understanding of the cultures of the world and how they interconnect– whether through trade, migration, conquest, or peaceful exchange."</p>
      <p>Manchester Museum has received four repatriation requests during the last 10 years, including one for a  skull from Hawaii which an indigenous group asked to be returned in 2010. This will remain at the museum until a clearer provenance can be determined.</p>
      <p>Several European countries, including France and Germany, have said they are committed to handing back objects, with the Rijksmuseum <a href="https://chase.telegraph.co.uk/etc/telegraph-author/index.html#edit/414ba6ed-d6f1-11e9-ae0a-06813a5dfefa">in Amsterdam opening talks with Sri Lanka and Indonesia and describing Holland’s’ failure to return stolen artefacts </a>as a “disgrace”.</p>
      <p>Edinburgh University defended the restitution of the skulls to the Vedda tribespeople.</p>
      <p>Professor Tom Gillingwater, Chair of Anatomy at the University, said: “We are pleased to be able to return these culturally-important artefacts to help ensure the Vedda’s legacy endures for generations to come.”</p>
