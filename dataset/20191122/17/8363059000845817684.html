      <p>The sale starts today with money off games and hardware, but no consoles just yet.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/campaigns/black-friday/">PlayStation's first round of Black Friday deals</a> includes discounted headsets, games - including PlayStation hits - and PS Plus membership.</p>
      <p>The Gold Wireless Headset (Black, Rose Gold, and Fortnite Neo Versa) is £49.99 down from the usual £69.99, while the Platinum Wireless Headset is £99.99 down from £139.99 - although some of the selected retailers are flogging them for even less that the officially discounted price, so keep an eye out for that.</p>
      <p>The library of PlayStation Hits titles has had a few quid knocked off, down from the usual £15.99 to £12.99, while there are other savings to be had on games on the PlayStation Store, including the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Grand Theft Auto V Premium Online Edition - £7.99</li>
        <li>FIFA 20 - £39.99</li>
        <li>Borderlands 3 - £34.99</li>
        <li>Days Gone - £34.99</li>
        <li>NBA 2K20 - £29.99</li>
        <li>Marvel’s Spider-Man - £15.99</li>
        <li>Blood &amp; Truth - £15.99</li>
        <li>Resident Evil 2 - £15.99</li>
        <li>Battlefield V - £15.99</li>
        <li>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled - £22.74</li>
        <li>Devil May Cry 5 - £15.99</li>
        <li>Monster Hunter: World - £12.99</li>
        <li>Red Dead Redemption 2: Ultimate Edition – £29.99</li>
        <li>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice: £38.99</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And if your PS Plus membership is up for renewal in the next week or so, you can pick up 12 months for 25 per cent off from either the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/IP9102-NPIA90006_01-PSPLUSSUBS12MDIS">PS Store</a> or an <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/campaigns/black-friday/_jcr_content/content_par/section_1111950569_c_1581006870/page-section-par/columnsystem/cell-1/cell-par/buttonrow_copy_copy_.retailers/">online retailer</a>. That'll bring the cost down from £49.99 to £34.99, saving you £15.</p>
      <p>PlayStation's Black Friday sale runs up until midnight on December 2, so there's plenty of time to peruse, with potentially more deals dropping next week.
