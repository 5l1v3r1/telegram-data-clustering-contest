      <p>The first Edinburgh derby of 2020 has also been moved on the request of BT Sport as they will screen the match from Easter Road on Tuesday 3 March.</p>
      <p>Champions Celtic will be shown six times from January to March. Along with the Rangers clash, they'll find their away trips to Kilmarnock, Hamilton, Motherwell, Aberdeen and Livingston all broadcast live on either Sky or BT.</p>
      <p>Rangers are on the box five times. The other four games are the away fixtures with Hearts, Kilmarnock, St Johnstone and Ross County.</p>
      <p>In addition to the all-Edinburgh clash there are six games set to be broadcast that don't involve either half of the Glasgow divide.</p>
      <p>Aberdeen are involved in three of those as Dons fans will get the chance to see their team in action without making the trip to St Mirren, Hamilton and Motherwell.</p>
