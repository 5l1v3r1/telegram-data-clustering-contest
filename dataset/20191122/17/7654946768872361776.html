      <p>Self-help guru Tony Robbins was accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl at an elite California summer camp in 1985, according to a new report.</p>
      <p>Robbins, then 25, was hired as a “star speaker” at SuperCamp in Oceanside, and, after his session, allegedly pinned the underage girl’s arms behind her back before kissing her and groping her breasts, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katiejmbaker/tony-robbins-accused-sexual-assault-teenager-supercamp">BuzzFeed News reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The article is the sixth in a series by BuzzFeed on sexual misconduct allegations against Robbins. He’s also <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/19/tony-robbins-accused-of-groping-harassing-more-women/">been accused of groping and harassing fans</a> and staffers and berating rape victims. He has denied the allegations.</p>
      <p>Shortly after Friday’s article was published, Robbins <a href="https://medium.com/@TonyRobbins/who-is-watching-the-watchdogs-126f59da378">wrote in a Medium blog post</a> that he was suing BuzzFeed for “following a premeditated and malicious campaign against me and my life’s work.”</p>
      <p>The alleged victim in the report, who is not named and whose exact age wasn’t revealed, provided the website with a 2,400-word statement through her lawyer describing the “prolonged sexual assault.”</p>

      <p>She said she’d finished a session with Robbins when he asked her to take a walk in the woods with him, during which he forced himself on her.</p>
      <p>At the time, Robbins, now 59, was already making a living as a popular motivational speaker.</p>
      <p>The article cites witnesses to the alleged assault, including one then-15-year-old, Steffanie Scott, who said she saw Robbins pinning the girl.</p>
      <p>“He was going for her, his whole body was pressed up against her,” Scott said. “I wouldn’t want to be pinned. Not like that.”</p>
      <p>Robbins’ attorneys denied the allegation, telling the website: “No sexual assault happened. Period.”</p>
