      <p>One year ago, a tabloid came up with an insane story about <b>Roseanne Barr</b> creating a new <i>Roseanne</i> spinoff after getting fired from the rebooted version show on ABC. <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted the story last year. Time has shown our reporting to be correct.</p>
      <p>On November 22, 2018, the <i>National Enquirer</i> wrote a bizarre story claiming Barr was creating a new <i>Roseanne</i> spinoff after getting dismissed from the reboot over racist tweets. Barr, known for her over-the-top political takes, was supposedly pitching a show where the rest of the <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/roseanne-new-show-spinoff-conners-killed/">Conner family “would die at the hands of illegals.”</a> The story was a blatant attempt to connect the controversial comedienne to contentious politics with the sole motivation of selling more papers.</p>
      <p>Barr was fired from the successful reboot after posting a controversial tweet about Valerie Jarrett, an advisor to President Obama. The incident drew major news coverage, especially after Barr blamed the tweet on the effects of the sleeping drug, Ambien. ABC reacted by canceling the revived show, then a few weeks later announced the rest of the cast would be returning for a new show called <i>The Conners</i>, which wouldn’t feature Barr. The tabloid’s outlandish take on the situation was clearly a way to stir controversy, rather than report facts.</p>
      <p>At the time, <b>Gossip Cop</b> highlighted that the piece was woefully lacking in detail, usually a sure sign that a tabloid is spinning more fiction than fact. The article also mentioned that Barr no longer owned the rights to the character she made famous on the show. That too, was incorrect, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/roseanne-spinoff-conners-officially-a-go-at-abc-1117397">as the <i>Hollywood Reporter</i> explained</a>. There were no details as to who Barr was pitching the show to, nor who else was involved. Finally, <b>Gossip Cop</b> checked with actress’ rep, who told us there was “no truth” to the story.</p>
      <p>The <i>National Enquirer</i> seems to have it out for Barr. Last month, the tabloid ran a false report claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/roseanne-barr-comedy-tour-stage-fright/">Barr’s stage fright was threatening to derail her comedy tour</a> with fellow controversial comedian, Andrew Dice Clay. Nothing could have been further from the truth, as the shows went off without a hitch and the comedienne has more dates lined up next spring. And as one can see, Barr has gotten back into standup comedy over the past year as opposed to making a spinoff show.</p>
      <p>The <i>Enquirer</i> is not the only gossip outlet to jump on the <i>Roseanne</i> controversy. In July 2018, the <i>Enquirer’s</i> online counterpart, RadarOnline, posted a phony report alleging <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/roseanne-beg-jerry-seinfeld-career-comeback-not-true/">Barr was begging Jerry Seinfeld to help her with a comeback</a>. The story quoted a purported insider as saying that Seinfeld has a “soft spot for cursed comedians,” and now she’s “begging him to help her out of her current mess.” Like the bogus spinoff story, this was just an attempt to draw eyeballs to the site with an outrageous story with no facts.</p>
