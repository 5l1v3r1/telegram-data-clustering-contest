      <h1>I'm A Celebrity fans baffled as Jacqueline Jossa doesn't recognise Cliff Parisi</h1>
      <h2>I'm A Celebrity 2019 contestants Cliff Parisi and Jacqueline Jossa both appeared on BBC soap EastEnders</h2>

      <p>I'm A Celebrity aired the arrival of new campmate Cliff Parisi on Thursday, with him joined by Coronation Street's Kirk Sutherland actor Andrew Whyment.</p>
      <p>Former EastEnders star Cliff, who played lovable Minty on the BBC soap, has yet to enter the main camp.</p>
      <p>Over in the camp, the original line-up learned about the new jungle stars and received a wanted poster with both Cliff and Andy's faces on.</p>
      <p>US star Caitlyn Jenner isn't familiar with British soaps, and was left asking her campmates if any of them knew who the two men were.</p>
      <p>Everyone was quick to point out Andy played Kirk in Corrie, but no one seemed to recognise Cliff.</p>

      <p>This baffled viewers given one of the campmates is former EastEnders actress Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
      <p>She played Lauren Branning on the soap, so fans were a little confused as to why she didn't recognise her fellow Walford star.</p>
      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , one fan said: "How did Jacqueline not recognise Cliff? They were in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Eastenders?src=hashtag_click">#Eastenders</a> briefly together after all. Or is it just cos it was nearly 10 years ago?"</p>

      <p>Another agreed: "How does Jacqueline not know who cliff is?!??"</p>
      <p>A third said: "loooool as if Jacqueline didnâ€™t know who Cliff was, she literally turned up in Walford the week he left, was there not a Christmas party?!"</p>
      <p>The scene was pretty quick and most likely edited, so perhaps Jacqueline did voice who Cliff was and it just did not air.</p>

      <p>Saying that, the pair didn't actually appear on-screen together with Minty departing Walford on 21st September 2010 - having joined in 2002.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it was just six days later that Jacqueline Jossa had replaced Madeline Duggan in the role of Lauren Branning.</p>
      <p>So the characters may not have crossed paths, but with there usually being around six weeks between filming and transmission they may have met on set.</p>
