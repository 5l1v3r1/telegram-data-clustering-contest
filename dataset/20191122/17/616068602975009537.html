        <b>UPDATE: 5:15 p.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A house fire on the 1200 block of 38th Avenue in Vernon Friday afternoon was contained to one room.</p>
      <p>A tenant of the home reported flames and heavy smoke in the basement. Upon arriving, firefighters confirmed the fire was located in the utility room and suppressed the fire quickly.</p>
      <p>“The fire was contained to a single room,” says Deputy Chief Dwight Seymour. “There is minimal fire and water damage to the house, but a fair bit of smoke damage, so the tenants of the home will need to stay out of the house for at least one night.”</p>
      <p>Emergency Social Services was on scene to assist the tenants. RCMP and BC Ambulance Service also attended the scene, but no injuries were reported.</p>
      <p>Seymour said the fire does not appear to be suspicious.</p>
