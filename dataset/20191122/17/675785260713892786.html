      <p>Ant McPartlin mocked his own sobriety on Thursday night's I'm A Celebrity: Extra Camp. </p>
      <p>The I'm A Celeb co-host made an appearance on the jungle spin-off with Dec Donnelly to chat about new campmate Andy Whyment.</p>
      <p>Emily Atack, who hosts Extra Camp quizzed the Geordie duo if they would like to enjoy a pint with the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> star.</p>
      <p>In response, Ant exclaimed: "I can't!"</p>
      <p>Dec seemed caught off-guard by the comment and was silent for a moment before laughing.</p>

      <p>Fans of the ITV show will recall that last year Ant took a break from hosting the hit series and was replaced by TV sweetheart Holly Willoughby - as a result of being charged with drink-driving and spending time in rehab.</p>
      <p>In April 2018, Ant admitted drink-driving and told a court that he was "ashamed and mortified" by a three-car crash that sent a four-year-old girl in hospital.</p>
      <p>It emerged that he was twice the legal limit when he crashed with his mother Christine Woodhall in his car on March 18.</p>
      <p>McPartlin - who earns £130,000 a week - was fined £86,000 and banned from driving for 20 months.</p>

      <p>Prosecutor Katie Sinnett-Jones told Wimbledon Magistrates' Court that the incident happened at around 3.50pm when McPartlin drove his Mini around a "sharp bend and lost control" then ended up on the wrong side of the road.</p>
      <p>He collided with another Mini Cooper before driving "straight into the front of an oncoming car".</p>
      <p>McPartlin's vehicle "came to a halt and was no longer driveable due to the damage caused", Ms Sinnett-Jones said. Members of the public called the police.</p>
      <p>In a statement to police, Ant apologised for his behaviour, admitting, "I'm very sorry I did this. I'm ashamed and mortified that this happened."</p>

      <p>And his defence barrister Liam Walker told the court Ant had suffered a 'brief relapse' which was 'unbenknowst' to his mum, who moved into his rented Chiswick home following his split from wife Lisa Armstrong.</p>
      <p>"Anthony McPartlin is sorry. He is doing everything he can so this never happens again. He hopes that in time he can make himself better and he might be forgiven by all the people he feels he has let down so terribly," Mr Walker continued.</p>
      <p>He added that Ant had been struggling to come to terms with the collapse of his marriage and has been getting treatment for "alcohol and emotional issues".</p>
      <p>"Through me, Mr McPartlin wishes to express both sorrow and regret over his actions," Mr Walker continued.</p>

      <p>"He is sorry, but not sorry because he is here. He knows it is right that he's here and he hopes that which has led him here will eventually help him. But for good fortune the consequences could have been worse. He feels the guilt that is reflected in his plea."</p>
      <p>Mr Walker spoke of McPartlin's "exemplary" character and charitable work, especially focusing on organisations that help children.</p>
      <p>"Mr McPartlin is lucky to have both family and long-time friends to support him," he added.</p>
      <p>District Judge Barbara Barnes told McPartlin "you are a well-known and successful entertainer," whose weekly income is around £130,000 a week.</p>
      <p>Sentencing him, she said: "At the time when it happened you were struggling with various personal problems and also alcohol issues for some months.</p>

      <p>"This incident happened, sadly, when it seems you suffered a brief relapse."</p>
      <p>The judge described McPartlin's previous "exemplary character" adding: "I think it will have quite an impact on you to know you're no longer a man of good character."</p>
      <p>Fining him, she said: "Because of the seriousness of this offence, the financial pain must be imposed on you as on any other offender."</p>
      <p>McPartlin was also told to pay £255 in costs.</p>
      <p>He was arrested and interviewed by police for 10 hours on March 18 following the three car smash in Mortlake, South West London.</p>
      <p>Three days after the smash, Ant was charged and then entered rehab for a second time.</p>
      <p>Following his arrest, Ant cancelled all work commitments for the 'foreseeable' future, including Saturday Night Takeaway and Britain's Got Talent.</p>
