      <h1>Rangers vs Celtic TV details revealed as SPFL release latest batch of fixtures</h1>
      <h2>There are a host of Premiership games to look forward to after the winter break.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:02:18+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:02</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>The last pre-split <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> v Celtic derby of the season will go ahead with a noon kick-off on Sunday, March 15, SPFL chiefs have revealed.</p>
      <p>The Ibrox clash - the third league meeting of the sides this season - will be beamed out live on Sky Sports as the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> title race enters the final straight.</p>
      <p>League bosses confirmed the latest raft of rearranged fixtures for after the winter break right up to the week before the split.</p>
      <p>But they have left the weekend of March 21/22 blank with Scotland’s crucial Euro 2020 play-off against Israel following just days later.</p>
      <p>SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell has written to SPFL secretary Iain Blair to formally request that no Scottish Premiership fixtures from the March 21 card are pushed back 24 hours to give Steve Clarke ample time to work with his players for the key fixture.</p>
      <p>However, if <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> or Rangers reach the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> last-16 then their games - at home to St Johnstone and away to St Mirren respectively - will have to be switched to the Sunday.</p>
      <p>Here are all the games that will be televised.</p>
