      <h1>Penn State Dealt Unfortunate Injury News Before Ohio State Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:22:31+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>When Penn State takes the field this Saturday against Ohio State, the offense will be missing a key starter. Redshirt junior offensive lineman Michal Menet will not be available to play this weekend.</p>
      <p>Menet has been the starting center for the Nittany Lions every game this season. Before his junior campaign even began he was named to the preseason Rimington Trophy Watch List</p>
      <p>Penn State will replace Menet with redshirt sophomore Mike Miranda, who typically plays offensive guard. Nonetheless, he’s second on the depth chart at center.</p>
      <p>FOX43 Sports first broke the news about Menet being inactive for this weekend with an undisclosed injury.</p>

      <p>As a result of this injury, freshman Blake Zalar and redshirt junior Hunter Kelly will most likely move up on the depth chart.</p>
      <p>To make matters worse for Penn State, the offensive line <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/ohio-state-buckeyes/chase-young-return-ohio-state-penn-state-instagram-message">will have to block Chase Young</a>. He’s ready to make a statement after missing the last two games due to a suspension.</p>
      <p>Since the Nittany Lions will be without Menet this weekend, the pressure is on the rest of the offensive line to step up.</p>
      <p>Kickoff for this game is at 12 p.m. ET from Ohio Stadium. The winner of this game would be in first place in the Big Ten East.</p>
