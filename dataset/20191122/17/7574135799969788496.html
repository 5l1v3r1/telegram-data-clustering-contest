      <p>The Church of Scientology has many famous (and infamous) members, Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Kirstie Alley, and Juliette Lewis among them. <b>Beck</b> has long been considered a member as well; he admitted to it in a June 2005 interview with the <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100915054237/http://www.tribune.ie/article/2005/jun/12/a-sort-of-homecoming/">Irish Sunday Tribune</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Yeah, I’m a Scientologist, ” Beck resumes once she has left. “My father has been a Scientologist for about 35 years, so I grew up in and around it and stuff.”</blockquote>
      <p>An October 2017 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/28/beck-colors-sunniest-album-felt-good">article in The Guardian</a> also brings up his church membership:</p>
      <blockquote>He’s a Scientologist, something I’ve been forbidden to ask about. (When Beck has spoken about his religion in the past, he’s described it as “something personal”, inherited from his father.)</blockquote>
      <p>However, as <i><a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2065897/beck-says-hes-not-a-scientologist/news/">Stereogum</a></i> points out, the topic came up in a new <i><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/culture/music/workaholic-beck-i-feel-a-little-guilty-if-something-s-too-easy-20191118-p53bnh.html">The Sydney Morning Herald</a></i> profile (were they allowed to ask about it?), where Beck says he actually isn’t a Scientologist:</p>
      <blockquote>I think there’s a misconception that I am a Scientologist. I’m not a Scientologist. I don’t have any connection or affiliation with it. My father has been a Scientologist for a long time, but I’ve pretty much just focused on my music and my work for most of my life, and tended to do my own thing … I think it’s just something people ran with.</blockquote>
      <p>Beck’s new album, <i><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/leonard-cohen-blood-incantation-obsequiae-tinashe-coldplay-beck-billy-corgan-reviews/">Hyperspace</a></i>, came out today.</p>
