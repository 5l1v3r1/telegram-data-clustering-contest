      <p>Louder has joined forces with with image editing software <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/">Affinity Photo</a> to find the best new rock photographers of 2020. Last month's heat was about live music photography and won by <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-first-winner-of-the-affinity-photo-new-rock-photographer-2020-is">a stunning shot of Damian Wilson crowd-surfing</a>.</p>
      <p>Challenge #2 is <b>Crowd &amp; Venue Scenes</b>. We are looking for new, original unpublished live shots of audiences – they could be taken at your local, at festivals or indoor live shows – but they should be shots that capture audience reactions, enthusiasm, as well as the scale of the audience,  or the attitude, style and fashion of the fans.</p>
      <p>Here are some shots from <i>Classic Rock</i> photographer and judge <a href="https://www.knixon.co.uk/">Kevin Nixon</a> to give you some inspiration:</p>

      <p>Affinity Photo picture-editing software is about speed, power and precision - and so is the best rock music. This photo competition is about finding new photographers who capture the spirit of rock’n’roll and helping them to get the best from their photographs.</p>
      <p>The competition will run over the next six months with a series of monthly challenges based around different aspects of music photography: live shots, portraits, shooting in black and white etc. The competition is free to enter and there are monthly prizes for the winners of each category. At the end of the six months, the judges will choose one overall winner who will receive:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>iPad Pro 11” + Apple Pencil + Affinity Photo for iPad</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The opportunity to go on assignment with Louder/Classic Rock/Metal Hammer/Prog photographer Kevin Nixon (OR - if geography makes that impossible - doing a Skype/online workshop with Kevin).</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The winning pictures will be published online on Louder and in our sister magazines (Classic Rock, Metal Hammer and Prog).</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally, all entrants will be able to buy the award-winning photo editing software Affinity Photo, on PC or Mac, for less than half price - £23.99 instead of the usual £48.99.</p>
      <p>Affinity’s John Atkin says: “Even the best photographers adjust their images before publication, and Affinity Photo is perfect whether you want to make quick corrections or complex, multi-layered edits.</p>
      <p>“The low one-off price and no monthly subscription means it’s ideal for photographers on a budget, or who might not be using it all the time, while still delivering all of the editing capabilities the top pros require. And it’s all backed up with a whole load of free, easy-to-follow video tutorials that can help make you a better photographer.”</p>
