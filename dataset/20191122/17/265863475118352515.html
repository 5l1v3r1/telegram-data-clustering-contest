      <h1>Diddy Sets Some Things Straight Regarding Himself And His Network, Revolt</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:11:25+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author">Ron Collins</a></address>
      <p>Diddy wanted to get some things off his chest about himself and his network, Revolt. Check out the message that he shared on his social media account.</p>
      <p>‘My name and my network, REVOLT, have been mentioned recently by Comcast in reference to the Comcast/Byron Allen US Supreme Court case as an example of Comcast’s inclusive practices with respect to African American owned cable networks,’ Diddy began.</p>
      <p>He continued and said: ‘While it is true that we are in business with Comcast, it is not accurate to use my name or my network as an example of inclusion. I do not want my name to be used inaccurately, so I must speak my truth. I also want to make clear that this case is now about much more than cable distribution. It’s about the civil rights of millions of African Americans and other minorities.⁣⁣’<br/>⁣<br/>Diddy went on and wrote that  ‘First, it’s important that people really understand what’s at stake. In its efforts to get the lawsuit filed by Byron Allen dismissed, Comcast has taken a legal approach that could weaken fundamental civil rights protections. I have a problem with this. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 section 1981 was designed to ensure Black people are able to do business in this country and not be denied because of race.’</p>

      <p>Diddy also added that Comcast is arguing that this law ‘only applies if racial discrimination is the only factor that leads to a refusal to do business, which would be extremely hard to prove. If they are successful, it will become much harder for any victim of discrimination to seek justice in court. By taking this stance in the Supreme Court, Comcast has put its legal tactics ahead of the rights of millions of Americans to be heard. This is not OK.⁣⁣’</p>
      <p>As expected Diddy triggered a debate in the comments, but most followers support him as expected.</p>
      <p>Someone said: ‘What can we do to help… Boycott? Ready for the next move. 💪🏽✊🏽’ and another follower posted this: ‘BLESS YOU SEAN !!!! 💙@diddy #byronallen fighting a good fight. May the Supreme Court decide what the other two courts have already decided.”</p>
      <p>In other news, not too long ago, Diddy remembered his late ex, Kim Porter, once again on social media, this time on the anniversary of her death.</p>
      <p>The rapper posted a picture and the<a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/diddy-honors-the-late-kim-porter-on-the-anniversary-of-her-death-check-out-his-heartbreaking-post-340932/"> emotional post</a> was really devastating and true fans understood.</p>
