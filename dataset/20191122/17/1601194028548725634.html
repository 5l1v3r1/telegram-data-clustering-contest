      <p>Considered by many fans to be the highlight of the 2018 WWE Survivor Series PPV was <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/charlotte-flair">Charlotte Flair</a>'s shocking and violent heel turn.</p>
      <p>Flair faced <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/ronda-rousey">Ronda Rousey</a> in a Champion vs Champion RAW vs SmackDown match, and after the bout was over, Flair would unleash a brutal attack on Rousey, the likes of which fans had not yet seen since Rousey began her WWE career.</p>
      <p>The brutal beatdown from Flair would eventually lead to the Triple Threat match which headlined this year's WrestleMania, and pitted Ronda Rousey against Becky Lynch against Charlotte Flair, with both the RAW and SmackDown Women's titles up for grabs.</p>
