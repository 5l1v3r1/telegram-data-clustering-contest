        <b>Taskmaster will move from UKTV channel Dave to Channel 4 in a new six-series deal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The entertainment show, hosted by Greg Davies, which sees comedians compete in a series of strange and surreal challenges, has run for nine series on Dave.</p>

      <p>The six series will air across three years, starting on Channel 4 in late 2020.</p>
      <p>Alex Horne, the show's creator and Davies's on-screen assistant, said: "We've had an amazing nine series on Dave and I'd like to thank UKTV for letting us do such ridiculous things for so long.</p>

      <p>"It seems like the right time to move to a channel with a broader audience and I can reassure people who like the show that it won't be changing one bit and I'll still be forced to do things no one should ever have to do."</p>
      <p>Davies added: "For the first time in our working relationship I agree with little Alex Horne.</p>
      <p>"The nine series on UKTV have been a joy and I would echo his thanks to all involved.</p>
      <p>"I do take issue with the notion that the show will remain exactly the same however as I have made it my personal mission to break his spirit.</p>
      <p>"I will remain even handed with contestants of course, but it really is going to get unpleasant for him. Peace."</p>
      <p>Taskmaster first started as a live show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe before being developed for television, initially with Channel 4.</p>
      <p>It was later commissioned by UKTV for Dave.</p>
      <p>The new series will air on Channel 4 before being repeated on E4.</p>
      <p>Ian Katz, director of programmes at Channel 4, said: "Taskmaster is anarchic, original and a brilliant springboard for new comic talent.</p>
      <p>"It's everything we look for in a Channel 4 show and like millions of others I'm a massive fan so I'm delighted it will soon be taking its place in our unrivalled slate of scripted and studio comedy."</p>
