      <h2>How do I register to vote, and how to get a postal vote?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:15:38+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Walker, https://www.facebook.com/JonWalkerPolitics?pnref=story</a></address>
      <p>The general election is on Thursday December 12  - but you have just days to apply for a vote, as the deadline to register is Tuesday 26 November.</p>
      <p>You  can check whether you are already registered with your local electoral registration office. That will be a department of your local council, so give the council a call or look on their website for information.</p>
      <p>If you live in the Birmingham City Council area, you can find out whether you are registered to vote by calling 0121 303 2731 or e-mailing electionsoffice@birmingham.gov.uk.</p>
      <h3>How do I register to vote?</h3>
      <p>You can register online by visiting <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote">gov.uk/register-to-vote</a> and answering a small number of questions.</p>
      <p>They include your name, address and National Insurance number. However, note that you can register even if you don't know your National Insurance number.</p>
      <h3>How long does it take?</h3>
      <p>About 5 minutes if you're not too speedy on a computer. Less if you have a quick mouse hand. It doesn't take long.</p>
      <h3>When is the deadline?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>You must register to vote by midnight on Tuesday 26 November.</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you want a <b>postal vote,</b> you must apply by <b>5pm on <b>Tuesday 26 November</b> .</b></p>
      <p>If you want a <b>proxy vote</b> (where you appoint someone to vote for you), you must apply by <b>Wednesday 4 December.</b></p>
      <p>For an <b>emergency proxy vote,</b> for example if you end up in hospital, it's <b>5pm on the day of the election, on December 12.</b></p>
      <h3>How does postal voting work?</h3>
      <p>If you can't get to your polling station, you can apply for a postal vote (although if you never get round to putting your completed ballot paper in the post, you can actually deliver it to the polling station on the day).</p>
      <p>A ballot paper will be sent out to any address you choose.</p>
      <p>You just need to fill it in, choose which way you want to vote and send it back so it arrives before 10pm on the day of the election.</p>
      <p>All the instructions are on the ballot paper.</p>
      <p>To apply for a postal vote, you need to download a form which you can find here: <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/voter/voting-person-post-or-proxy/voting-post">https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/voter/voting-person-post-or-proxy/voting-post</a></p>
      <p>The form must be printed out and completed, and signed.</p>
      <p>You then need to send the form to your local electoral registration office. As we said before, that's a department of your local council, so contact your council or look at their website to find out exactly where you need to take the form.</p>
      <p>If you are not sure who your local council is then the <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/voter/voting-person-post-or-proxy/voting-post">Electoral Commission website</a> will tell you.</p>
      <p>If Birmingham is your local council then the form can be handed in to council's offices in Victoria Square; posted; sent by fax on 0121 212 1065, or scanned and then emailed in PDF form to <a href="mailto:absentvotes@birmingham.gov.uk">absentvotes@birmingham.gov.uk</a> . There are more details on the council website at <a href="https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/info/20097/elections_and_voting/699/voting_by_post/3">https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/info/20097/elections_and_voting/699/voting_by_post/3</a> .</p>
      <p>However if Birmingham is not your local council then you must check with your council to find out where the form needs to go.</p>
      <h3>What about proxy voting?</h3>
      <p>This means if you're unable to go to the polling station for reasons such as going on holiday or having a disability then you can have somebody else vote on your behalf.</p>
      <p>The deadline to apply for a proxy vote in the UK Parliamentary general election is 5pm on 4 December.</p>
      <p>If you need an emergency proxy vote then you can apply for one up to 5pm on polling day. But this is only possible if you have a problem preventing you from going to the polling station that you didn't know about before December 4.</p>
      <h3>How do I vote by proxy?</h3>
      <p>You must give a reason why you need to vote by proxy and may need a qualified person to sign your application.</p>
      <p>You may be able to deliver the form by hand or send a scan of the completed and signed form via email to your local authority.</p>
      <p>The person you nominate must then vote in person for you.</p>
      <h3>Who can vote for me?</h3>
      <p>Any person you appoint if they are 18 or over and are registered individually.</p>
      <p>A person cannot be a proxy for more than two people at one election, unless they are a close relative.</p>
      <p>Close relatives are the spouse, civil partner, parent, grandparent, brother, sister, child or grandchild of the applicant.</p>
