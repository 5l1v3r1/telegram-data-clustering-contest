      <h2>Flick was put in temporary charge of the German giants after Niko Kovac was sacked</h2>

      <p>Bayern Munich interim boss Hansi Flick has insisted he will not be distracted by speculation surrounding the club's next manager as Mauricio Pochettino continues to be linked to the Bundesliga giants.</p>
      <p>Flick has been Bayern's caretaker manager since the German champions parted company with Niko Kovac at the start of November after a poor run of form.</p>
      <p>Former Spurs boss Pochettino, who was sacked by the Premier League club earlier this week, is considered to be one of the leading candidates to land the permanent job at the Allianz Arena.</p>
      <p>Despite the rumours surrounding the Argentinian, Flick says he is not in any position to comment on potential appointments and is concentrating on getting the best out of his team.</p>

      <p>"It is not my job to analyse coaching colleagues," he said ahead of Bayern's trip to Fortuna Dusseldorf on Saturday (via <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/pochettino-to-bayern-munich-one-of-several-options-admits/1m747az5kyv76182640f8yk4ln">Goal</a> ).</p>
      <p>"The club now has all the options to look for the future, whatever they want.</p>
      <p>"I'm doing my job now and trying to be successful with the team.</p>
      <p>"Football is a day-to-day business, it can be different tomorrow than yesterday.</p>

      <p>"We'll wait until the winter break, then we'll sit down together."</p>
      <p>Bayern chose to sack Kovac after a disappointing start to their Bundesliga campaign which saw them win just three of their opening six and suffer a heavy 5-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Flick's first two matches in charge saw the German giants secure back-to-back wins against Olympiakos and Borussia Dortmund - with the latter a dominant 4-0 victory.</p>

      <p>Although it was initially believed that Bayern would look to appoint Kovac's successor during the international break, the club have since indicated that Flick will remain in charge until at least Christmas.</p>
      <p>"We prepare just as before," added Flick on the current situation. "I am completely satisfied with the solution.</p>
      <p>"It is crucial that the club has time to think about what is right for the future."</p>
