      <p>Media heiress Abigail Disney is affirming her support for millennials’ use of the viral phrase “OK, Boomer” to criticize her own generation.</p>
      <p>“If (millennials) are angry I don’t blame them,” Disney, 59, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/disney-heiress-reaffirms-her-support-for-millennials-and-ok-boomer.html">told CNBC</a> anchor Karen Tso at the Women’s Forum in Paris on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Millennials and Generation Z-ers use the phrase to sarcastically taunt Baby Boomers whom they view as out of touch with the economic and social struggles of younger generations. Some older people have called it a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/02/millennials-extreme-hatred-for-baby-boomers-is-totally-unjustified/">disrespectful jab</a> — but the backlash hasn’t deterred Fox Media from wanting to potentially <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/gen-zs-ok-boomer-meme-may-become-a-tv-show/">turn it into a TV show</a>.</p>
      <p>Disney — the granddaughter of Walt Disney Company co-founder Roy O. Disney — first issued a staunch defense of the slogan in a Nov. 10 <a href="https://twitter.com/abigaildisney/status/1193659964503547909">Twitter thread</a>, asking when members of her generation got “so easily triggered.”</p>
      <p>“Oh, and does anyone remember not trusting anyone over 30??? Good lord I bet half of the nudniks complaining about youth disrespecting them were all over that freight train of prejudice and bad judgment,” <a href="https://twitter.com/abigaildisney/status/1193659990302711808">she tweeted.</a> “How about you guys sit the f— down and let the kids drive.”</p>
      <p>Disney admitted she was “a little angry” at herself for weighing in on the debate “because you can’t make generalizations about generations.” But she told CNBC that she gets why millennials are irritated.</p>
      <p>“(Millennials are) coming out of college with massive amounts of debt, some of them can never hope to pay it off,” Disney said, according to CNBC. “So they’re taking jobs they otherwise wouldn’t have taken. They’re not taking risks, they otherwise would have taken.”</p>
