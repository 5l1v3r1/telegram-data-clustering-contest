      <p>A mother discovered she was a victim of the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/leaked-documents-reveal-nhss-worst-ever-maternity-scandal-time/">Shrewsbury maternity scandal</a> following media coverage - 15 years after the death of her baby son. </p>
      <p>Kamaljit Uppal, 50, was at home watching TV when the scandal-hit Trust was featured on the news following calls for a wider probe into deaths at a hospital's maternity unit. </p>
      <p>The Government had been investigating Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals Trust after former health secretary Jeremy Hunt ordered an independent inquiry in 2017 into seven deaths at the unit.</p>
      <p>Mrs Uppal’s son, who she named Manpreet, died on the 17th April 2003 at Shrewsbury Hospital after he became trapped during delivery and was starved of oxygen.</p>
      <p>But it wasn’t until last year that Mrs Uppal realised her son’s death may have been part of wider failings by the Trust. </p>
      <p>Mrs Uppal, from Telford, said: “When it all came out on the TV, I was gobsmacked.</p>
      <p>“I was sitting at home and the news came on and I was like it’s happening again, it’s happening to so many people.” </p>
      <p>Mrs Uppal had asked doctors and midwives multiple times for a caesarean section after her baby was confirmed to be breech at her five month scan but was denied. </p>
      <p>Further complications arose during the birth, including when a foot was presented, but the decision was made to continue with a vaginal birth. </p>
      <p>It wasn’t until her baby became trapped at his shoulders that a crash caesarean section was performed. </p>
      <p>Baby Manpreet was born at 9.20am but died two and a half hours later. </p>
      <p>Following a post-mortem it was confirmed that he had died of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, meaning the oxygen supply to his brain was cut off. </p>
      <p>Mrs Uppal attended a six week review in 2003 where she was told that had her child been delivered earlier he would have “lived an ordinary life”. </p>
      <p>She said the 2003 review left her feeling “hurt” and “weak” and that she had “nobody to turn to''. </p>
      <p>The mother-of-three said she was never given an explanation for the circumstances that led to her son’s death. </p>
      <p>Emotional, Mrs Uppal told the Telegraph: “I haven’t had closure. My son hasn’t had justice. It was all shoved under the carpet.” </p>
      <p>She added that life without Manpreet is “not the same”. </p>
      <p>“He’ll always be in my heart. My kids are growing and he’s missing and it does hurt.”   </p>
      <p>Medical records obtained by Mrs Uppal’s legal team at Shoosmiths show a letter from her consultant obstetrician from the time that reads: “I am slightly at a loss to explain why she had such difficulty particularly as the baby was not excessively large and she had two successful deliveries in the past, all with smaller babies.” </p>
      <p>Mrs Uppal’s solicitor Kashmir Uppal a Partner at Shoosmiths medical negligence team said the letter was “startling.'' </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/20/nhs-chiefs-said-families-seeking-answers-baby-deaths-acting/">This week more families have come forward </a>to say they suffered at the hands of the Trust when a leaked interim report revealed that a “toxic” culture saw the death of 45 mothers and babies. </p>
      <p>It showed that more than 50 children also suffered brain damage linked to alleged failings in care. </p>
      <p>The NHS revealed more than 326 new cases of concern, with the review, which is being led by maternity expert Donna Ockenden, going back as far back as 1979. It includes Mrs Uppal’s case.</p>
      <p>The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust's current interim chief executive, Paula Clark, said on Tuesday that she wished to “apologise unreservedly to the families who have been affected.”</p>
