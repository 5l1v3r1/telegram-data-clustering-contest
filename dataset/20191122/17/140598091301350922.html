      <h1>Adam Peaty praises new International Swimming League ahead of its UK debut in London</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:36:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/jeremy-wilson/" target="_blank">Jeremy Wilson</a></address>
      <p>Olympic champion Adam Peaty believes that fans at the sold-out London Aquatics Centre will witness a new era for the sport when the International Swimming League makes its UK debut on Saturday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/swimming/2019/03/06/olympic-champion-adam-peaty-defies-fina-become-ambassador-revolutionary/">Peaty has been a long-time critic of the failure of Fina </a>- world swimming’s governing body - to evolve more rapidly and is one of the figureheads behind the revolutionary new ISL series, which will culminate next month at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>The rapid-fire format involves early evening sessions lasting only two hours on Saturday and Sunday, but still packing in 38 races across the weekend. There are 12 men and 12 women in each of the eight <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/swimming/2019/10/05/us-star-natalie-coughlin-reveals-new-international-swimming/">competing teams </a>(four from Europe and four from the United States of America), who are prohibited from selecting any athlete with a past anti-doping violation.</p>
      <p>"We have been doing it wrong for 25-30 years,” said Peaty. “The same format has been happening since before I was even born. It has taken the ISL to wake up Fina to prove that we need something else, a different stimulus, a different format and not racing for yourself and racing for your country. I love the crowd and I love showboating. It's not going to replace the Olympics or the World Championships but it will compliment it as the years go by."</p>
      <p>Peaty, who earlier this year became the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/swimming/2019/07/21/adam-peaty-becomes-first-man-swim-57-seconds-100m-breaststroke/">first swimmer to go under 57 seconds in the 100m breastroke,</a> will race in the London Roar team alongside British swimmers Duncan Scott and Siobhan Marie O’Connor, as well as Olympic champion Bronte Campbell.</p>

      <p>Katinka Hosszú, Sarah Sjöström and Chad le Clos are among the other leading international swimmers in London this weekend. O’Connor said that the ISL was “like nothing else I’ve ever seen in swimming before”, with each evening culminating in relay and skins races - back-to-back races, operating on a knock-out basis, which carry double points.</p>
      <p>The organisers of the ISL, which has been backed by a £17 million investment, intend already to extend the format from the seven dates this year to make it an annual event running between September or October and December.</p>
      <p>“Every sport needs to capture the imagination of the public and future generations,” said Rob Woodhouse, the general manager of the London Roar team. “This will hopefully inspire a lot of kids to get into the sport and stay in the sport.</p>
