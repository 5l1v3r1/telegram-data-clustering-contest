      <h1>Tesla’s Cybertruck is available for preorder with a $100 deposit</h1>
      <h2>Production doesn’t start until late 2021</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:08:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-j-hawkins" target="_blank">Andrew J. Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>Tesla’s newly revealed Cybertruck is now available for preorder at <a href="http://tesla.com/cybertruck">tesla.com/cybertruck</a>. The company is currently taking $100 deposits to reserve the truck. But as Tesla CEO Elon Musk noted during an event in Los Angeles on Thursday night, deliveries are still a ways off.</p>
      <p>There are three versions of the truck available:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Single motor rear-wheel drive with 250 miles of range, 7,500-pound towing capacity, and 0–60 mph capabilities in under 6.5 seconds, for $39,900</li>
        <li>Dual motor all-wheel drive with 300 miles of range, 10,000-pound towing capacity, and 0–60 mph in under 4.5 seconds for $49,900</li>
        <li>Triple motor all-wheel drive with 500 miles of range, 14,000-pound towing capacity, and 0–60 mph in under 2.9 seconds for $69,900 (though this version won’t start production until late 2022)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Autopilot comes standard, but like Tesla’s other vehicles, “full self-driving” capabilities will cost an extra $7,000.</p>
      <p>The $100 deposits are fully refundable, Tesla says. Customers can finish configuring their vehicles as production nears in late 2021.</p>
