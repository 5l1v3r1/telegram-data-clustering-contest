      <p>The song originally featured on The Doors’ debut self-titled album (1967), which famously soundtracks the opening scene of Francis Ford Coppola’s seminal 1979 film <i>Apocalypse Now</i>.</p>

      <p>‘The End’ is one of a handful of covers Manson has released in his career including 2001’s ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/track/reviews-nme-6164">Tainted Love</a>‘ (originally sung by Gloria Jones and later reworked by Soft Cell) and his recent rendition of the traditional folk tune ‘God’s Gonna Cut You Down’.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/11/marilyn-manson-the-doors-the-end/?fbclid=IwAR0y3DkZxMqeVp8EPgAjVQ0WQmyqumf80Eye4ES7-b3hgUj28gJviITDQC0"><i>Consequence of Sound</i></a> reports, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/marilyn-manson-cast-in-stephen-king-the-stand-tv-series-2525960">the singer previously announced he was recording a cover of ‘The End’ for the Stephen King miniseries <i>The Stand,</i> in which he’ll also star</a>.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Manson has been working on his new album. <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/marilyn-manson-provides-update-new-album-2526264">Over the summer the ‘Antichrist Superstar’ artist said he planned for the record to be released by the end of 2019</a>.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s the album that should be called <i>Marilyn Manson</i>,” he said at the time. “I’m in a mode in life where I wanted to tell stories with this record, and it’s sort of like a wax museum of my thoughts, a study of the chamber of horrors in my head.</p>
      <p>“All the romance and hope you can have in the world, here in the End Times where it can be a different kind of apocalypse for each person listening to the record.”</p>
      <p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-marilyn-manson-joint-us-tour-tickets-2568201">Manson will join Ozzy Osbourne a joint US tour, which kicks off in May 2020</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s not known at this stage if Manson’s cover of ‘The End’ will feature on his upcoming as-yet-untitled eleventh album, which will be the follow-up to 2017’s <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/marilyn-manson-heaven-upside-down-review-2147183">‘Heaven Upside Down’</a>.</p>
