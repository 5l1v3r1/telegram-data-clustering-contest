      <h1>I'm A Celebrity's Jacqueline Jossa 'to do every Bushtucker Trial' this series</h1>
      <h2>Jacqueline Jossa was left in tears on I'm A Celebrity as she was voted to do the latest Bushtucker Trial by viewers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:38:07+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:38</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity viewers think former EastEnders star Jacqueline Jossa will be up for plenty of Bushtucker Trials this series.</p>
      <p>A usual format on the ITV jungle show, hosted by Ant and Dec, could mean the Lauren Branning actress does several challenges.</p>
      <p>After spotting a pattern in previous series, and given her reaction to the news she'd be doing the next trial, fans now think she will be the next serial trial doer.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline is super squeamish, and in both challenges she has done so far she's been left in tears by even the thought of doing them.</p>

      <p>On Thursday night, she was left visibly distressed when Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly told her the news.</p>
      <p>Fans immediately took to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , and tipped her to be voted again and again for the rest of the series.</p>
      <p>In the past viewers have seen those campmates who visibly struggle with jungle life forced to do task after task by the public.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/katie-price">Katie Price</a> , Natalie Appleton and Helen Flanagan have all been jungle stars who have done numerous challenges, often back-to-back.</p>
      <p>There's always one person facing the most amount of trials, and if fans are correct this year it will be Jacqueline.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter, fans shared their theory as others admitted they hoped it wasn't going to be the case.</p>

      <p>One fan said: "I kinda get the feeling Jacqueline will face most (if not all) bushtucker trials!"</p>
      <p>Another tweeted: "Jacqueline crying has just cemented the public voting her for every bush tucker trial from here on out."</p>
      <p>A third added: "I hope the public donâ€™t vote Jacqueline Jossa to do all the bad trials."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a fourth viewer commented: "That'll be Jacqueline doing every trial then."</p>
