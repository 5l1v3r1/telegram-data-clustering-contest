      <p>Dubai - <b>Mike Lorenzo-Vera</b> fired a second-round 69 to widen his lead to three strokes at the half-way stage of the DP World Tour Championship on Friday.</p>
      <p>But he was left lamenting a triple-putt bogey on the final hole that denied him the chance to rewrite the record books.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman's 12-under par 132 matched the lowest 36-hole score in the 11-year history of the European Tour's season-ending championship.</p>
      <p>England's Tommy Fleetwood and Spain's Jon Rahm, two players who can overtake current Race to Dubai leader Bernd Wiesberger and become the European number one, were tied for second at nine-under par 135.</p>
      <p>Fleetwood, looking for a second straight win in two weeks after his Nedbank Challenge triumph, shot a 68, while Rahm eagled the 18th hole in his 69.</p>
      <p>Wiesberger was nine shots behind the leader at three-under after a 71. If the results stand as of Sunday, Fleetwood will be crowned the Race to Dubai champion for the second time.</p>
      <p>World number two McIlroy, who could do no wrong in his opening-round 64, struggled throughout the day and came home in 74 to slip to tied fifth place at 138.</p>
      <p>England's Tom Lewis (70) was in fourth position at 137.</p>
      <p>At one stage, Lorenzo-Vera, who led overnight by one stroke, had moved to five-under par and enjoyed a six-shot advantage. But he dropped a shot on the 15th and then came unstuck on the last hole.</p>
      <p>"I think a three-shot lead is much better than being three behind," said the Frenchman, who is yet to win on the European Tour in 277 starts.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old was candid enough to admit that the $3 million winner's cheque, the biggest in the history of professional golf, was on his mind.</p>
      <p>"Last night, I just sat down and tried to forget about it, but I could not. So I just embraced it. I went online and tried to find out ways I could spend it. I have already looked at some cars that I'd want to buy if I win."</p>
      <p>Fleetwood made three bogeys on a day when the swirling wind in the afternoon posed problems but seven birdies ensured a round of 68.</p>
      <p>"It was a good day. Played really well and stayed very patient," he said.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't easy today. The wind really picked up. I think anything under par would have been really solid, so 4-under... I'm happy."</p>
      <p>As for his position in the race to become the European No 1, the 28-year-old from Southport added: "There's a lot of different scenarios and players in the mix," he said.</p>
      <p>"You have to be more internally focused just stay in your bubble. It will just be a great challenge going into the weekend trying to do that."</p>
      <p>Rahm was two-over after eight holes but finished strongly on three-under.</p>
      <p>"I felt odd all day. I missed quite a few short putts early on," said the world number five.</p>
      <p>In the battle for the Rookie of the Year title, Scotland's Robert MacIntyre seemed to be opening a significant gap over the USA's Kurt Kitayama, but a double bogey on the 17th hole ensured they were separated by just one shot.</p>
      <p>MacIntyre, ranked 11th in the Race to Dubai, shot a 74 and was on 145 while, Kitayama, 12th in the race,added a 75 to his overnight 71.</p>
