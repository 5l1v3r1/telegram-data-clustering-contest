      <h1>Real estate market specifics can feel much different than the overall data might indicate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:59:28+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:59</time> by <a rel="author">Joel Schlesinger, for the Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Home resales have been on the rise in Calgary, pointing to a stabilized market. But the view from the trenches can offer a different perspective, realtors says.</p>
      <p>Sales for the city, for instance, increased by almost 10 per cent last month compared with the October 2018, the fourth consecutive month of rising year over year sales, Calgary Real Estate Board data show.</p>
      <p>Yet Bryan Morrow, an asset recovery (foreclosure) specialist with Real Estate Professionals Inc., notes stability in the market is uneven.</p>
      <p>“Let me put it this way… the numbers … don’t always speak to the reality on the ground,” he says.</p>
      <p>He argues prices, based on his experience, have declined by about 20 per cent from the peak in 2014.</p>
      <p>“I’m out there selling them and it’s 20 per cent, more or less, (for single-detached homes) and for condos, you can add another 10 per cent to make it 30 per cent-plus.”</p>
      <p>By contrast, CREB data show detached home prices are down seven per cent, and the condo market is down about 17 per cent from 2014.</p>
      <p>“It is reasonable to assume some homes have declined by more than the city-wide average, just as some homes have declined by less than the city-wide average,” says Ann-Marie Lurie, chief economist with CREB.</p>
      <p>“However, all we can do is speak to the general trend and price declines across the city.”</p>
      <p>Morrow, working as a realtor since the late 1970s, says the weakness is most pronounced in the upper-middle segment.</p>
      <p>“If you take a house five years ago that would have sold for $800,000… it would be selling for probably $600,000 today,” he says.</p>
      <p>He points to a single-detached home on the market in Pump Hill since May 2018, first listed at about $680,000. Today it lists for $535,000.</p>
      <p>Lurie notes the neighbourhood has seen prices for single-detached homes fall by 17 per cent from 2014.</p>
      <p>And “year-to-date prices have declined this year by nearly eight per cent.”</p>
      <p>Real estate broker and owner of Re/Max Prime Tim Jones says the higher priced homes have been slow to move because of the high number of white-collar energy job losses in the downtown area, which helped drive the segment just a few years ago.</p>
      <p>The upside is “if you’re doing a move-up from under a $500,000 home (to above), you’re in really good shape.”</p>
      <p>Deals can be found in the lower priced segments, too, Morrow says, pointing to a condo he had listed at $138,000.</p>
      <p>“That is the cheapest condo in the northeast,” he says.</p>
      <p>Lurie notes prices are down about 16 per cent from 2014 in that part of the city.</p>
      <p>Despite the challenges, Morrow says foreclosures have not spiked. As of the end of October, he says about 160 homes are in foreclosure in Calgary. “I thought by 2016 and 2017 that we’d be flooded with foreclosures, but it hasn’t happened.”</p>
      <p>What has surged, however, is the percentage of new and vacant homes on the market, Jones says.</p>
      <p>Roughly half of current listings are vacant or new (47 per cent for single-family, 50 per cent for apartments and 45 per cent for attached), he says.</p>
      <p>But it’s not all gloom and doom.</p>
      <p>“It’s not great, but it’s not horrible either,” Jones says.</p>
      <p>“There are some great opportunities for buyers.”</p>
