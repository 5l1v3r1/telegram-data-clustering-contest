      <p>
        <b>Nugget off to New Zealand with Pivac</b>
      </p>
      <p>As reported by WalesOnline, the Welsh Rugby Union have today confirmed that former flanker <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/martyn-williams-key-wales-job-17298105">Martyn Williams will be their new senior team manager.</a></p>
      <p>Williams takes over from Alan Phillips, who has been in the job for 18 years and now moves on to a role with the British and Irish Lions.</p>
      <p>The ex-flanker will be thrown right in and is set to fly around the world with new head coach Wayne Pivac for a recce in New Zealand ahead of next year's summer tour.</p>
      <p>"Martyn will spend a few days with us next week as part of the Barbarians match preparations and will be in New Zealand with me next month as part of the planning recce ahead of next summer’s tour and then will begin the role full-time in January," said Pivac.</p>
      <p>"I’m really looking forward to working with him."</p>
      <p>Part of the team manager's role is to scope out the hotels and training grounds for the team to use when they arrive. As such, Williams' job will involve plenty of trips abroad to scope out the facilities well in advance.</p>

        <b>Dragons play in empty stadium</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Dragons were out in Russia this evening playing the European Challenge Cup against Enisei-STM.</p>
      <p>The game was taking place in Krasnodar, just under 5,000km away from where Enisei-STM are based in Krasnoyarsk. This is because the weather in Krasnoyarsk at this time of year makes their pitch unplayable.</p>
      <p>As such, the game is moved across the country and Krasnodar is actually closer to Newport than it is Enisei's home.</p>
      <p>It's resulted in an empty stadium and virtually no fans turning up to the 35,000-seater Kuban Stadium.</p>
      <p>

        <b>World Cup finalists back to face the Ospreys</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Ospreys are back in European action this weekend and face a daunting trip to defending English and European Champions Saracens.</p>
      <p>Mark McCall's side have faced their fair share of turmoil in recent weeks, in light of their punishment for breaching the Gallagher Premiership salary cap.</p>
      <p>Last weekend, they sent a weakened side out to Paris to face Racing 92, appearing to place an emphasis on the Premiership this season.</p>
      <p>But, for the visit of the Ospreys, they are bolstered by the return of World Cup finalists Elliot Daly, Mako Vunipola and George Kruis.</p>
      <p>It makes the Welsh region's task that much more difficult.</p>

        <b>England star facing spell on sidelines</b>
      </p>
      <p>Joe Cokanisiga is facing some time out after returning from the Rugby World Cup with a knee injury.</p>
      <p>His club side, Bath, have released a statement insisting that their medical department will enlist the help of 'world-leading' specialists.</p>
      <p>“Joe is a phenomenal talent and a powerful athlete, and we must manage him very carefully in the coming months to allow for the issues he has come back from Japan with to begin to be resolved," said Director of Rugby Stuart Hooper.</p>
