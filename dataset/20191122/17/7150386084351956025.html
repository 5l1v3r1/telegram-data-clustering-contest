      <p><b>New Delhi: </b>In the backdrop of increased surveillance by Chinese and Pakistani online espionage agents, the Indian Army has directed its 13-lakh personnel to refrain from using WhatsApp and other social media platforms, stated a report. As per the advisory, army personnel holding ‘sensitive appointments’ were asked to delete their Facebook accounts.</p>
      <p>These advisories have been issued as a precautionary measure as there is a constant hunt by secret agents to obtain sensitive data about the Indian armed forces, stated a report.</p>
      <p>Recently, the mobile number of an Indian army officer who was posted under the Sukna-based 33 Corps in the Eastern Command was automatically added to a WhatsApp group by a suspected Pakistani mobile number, stated a report by Times of India.</p>
