        <b>Marco Silva has said that he is delighted that his friend Jose Mourinho is back in the Premier League, but if he had any doubts about his own managerial position he certainly wasn’t showing it at Finch Farm on Friday.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/marco-silva"><b>The Everton boss</b></a> cut a relaxed and composed figure as he spoke at his pre-match press conference ahead of the Premier League visit of rock-bottom Norwich City on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Of course, for Mourinho to take the reins at White Hart Lane, Mauricio Pochettino had to be relieved of his duties, prompting one reporter to ask if Silva had to seek assurances about his own future.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese manager was not interested in taking the bait, saying: “It’s crazy. The situation is the situation. We don’t have to look at the other clubs to try to think for ourselves what is happening.</p>
      <p>“We as a club need to look for ourselves and look at what we want to do and what we want to do together. Nothing more.”</p>
      <p>Silva is under big pressure, from supporters at least, to move <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/everton"><b>Everton</b></a> higher up the table and create a team that can compete for a European place.</p>
      <p>But his record in his first 50 Premier League matches as Goodison Park chief shows that he has gathered more wins, more points, more goals and 11 less goals conceded than the 50 Everton league games that preceded him.</p>
      <p>“It will be a surprise to some people who were unaware about Everton’s last 50 games before I came. What I can tell you [is] I want more. The next 50 I want to improve these numbers. We want to keep improving,” he said.</p>
      <p>“About pressure, you have been asking me about this since the day I arrived and for sure it will be the same until the end. For me it is a privilege to have pressure because I choose this job. I love this job.</p>
      <p>“Pressure means we want to win and that is everything that I want in my career,” he added.</p>

      <p>That pressure will no doubt morph itself into expectation on Saturday when Everton’s loyal supporters will demand nothing less than a victory against rock-bottom Norwich City.</p>
      <p>The formbook suggests that they are well-placed to deliver on it, with the Blues suffering only one contentious defeat against Brighton in the last five matches in all competitions, while the Canaries have not registered a league win since sensationally upsetting Manchester City on 14 September.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Silva warned against taking Norwich lightly, pointing to their well-organized structure and attractive style of play.</p>
      <p>“It will be up to us to create problems by being aggressive,” he said. “If that pressure valve is to be released a little on the Everton boss then three points at Goodison Park on Saturday is the minimum requirement.”</p>
