      <p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/google-stadia/">Google Stadia</a> is here and the experience isn’t quite what was promised. <a href="https://wccftech.com/stadia-destiny-2-1080p-medium-rdr2-1440p/">As we’ve reported</a>, the “4K” version of Destiny 2 you get with Stadia Pro is actually 1080p upscaled, while the Pro stream of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/red-dead-redemption-2/">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> is native 1440p at 30fps. Well, now the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9PBzalIcEQCsiIkq36PyUA">tech heads at Digital Foundry</a> have delved even deeper to find out what kind of visual quality you can expect from the Stadia Pro stream of Red Dead Redemption 2, and it’s a pretty mixed bag. Check out the full video below, if you’ve got 20 minutes to spare.</p>

      <p>If you want to absolute best-looking version of Red Dead Redemption 2, it definitely seems like Stadia is not the way to go. Ah, but where things really get interesting is input latency – you’d expect Xbox One X and PC to blow Stadia away here, but that actually isn’t the case. Digital Foundry recorded input latency of 385 milliseconds on Stadia, 355 milliseconds on PC, and a surprising 435 milliseconds on Xbox One X. So yeah, if you don’t mind the Old West looking just a little bit grubby, Red Dead Redemption 2 actually plays pretty well on Stadia.</p>
      <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is available now on PC, Xbox One, PS4, and Google Stadia. For those who watched the video – what do you think? Could you see yourself playing RDR2 on Stadia?</p>
