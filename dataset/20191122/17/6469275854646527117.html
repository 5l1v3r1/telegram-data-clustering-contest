        <b>Plans to create a community hub in Broughton have the green light.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The empty Toll Bar Cottage in Garstang Road is now set for a new lease of life as the nod from Preston City Council means it will be transformed into a community cafe.</p>
      <p>Pat Hastings, chairman of Broughton Parish Council, wants to set up cycle racks at the site so that people on the Guild Wheel will be able to enjoy a break at the cafe.</p>
      <p>She said: “People can come in and have a brew and a chat.</p>
      <p>“There will be police drop in surgeries, health promotion and decent Internet.</p>
      <p>“It’s all about getting it going.”</p>
