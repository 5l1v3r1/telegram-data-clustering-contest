      <p>Two CRPF jawans sustained injuries in a grenade attack near Manipur Legislative Assemblyâ€™s western gate, Imphal West, on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>The blast comes a day after militants attacked a camp of the Assam Rifles in Chandel district.</p>
      <p>The police said the grenade exploded around 5.25 pm when the two jawans were on duty near the Assembly. The injured personnel have been admitted to Regional Institute of Medical Sciences, Lamphel. They are reported to be out of danger.</p>
      <p>The injured were identified as a 40-year-old G C Raba, a resident of Assam and 37-year-old Yadav Munna, a resident of West Bengal. The jawans who are originally posted in Jiribam, were currently deployed in Imphal owing to the unrest prevailing in the wake of the yet-to-be signed Indo-Naga peace deal.</p>
      <p>The police have recovered a lever of the bomb near the blast site. Local residents of the area strongly denounced the attack near residential areas that could put the life of civilians at risk.</p>
      <p>They also drew the attention of the government seeking to not deploy security personnel in residential areas to avoid civilian casualties. While it is yet to be ascertained who is behind the attack, the police have registered an FIR in connection with the incident.</p>
