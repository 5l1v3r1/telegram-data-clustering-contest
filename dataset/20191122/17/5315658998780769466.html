      </p>
      <p>Police are appealing for witnesses to an incident this morning where a woman suffered injuries while driving along the North-Western Motorway.</p>
      <p>The woman had been traveling East, in the left hand lane, and passing underneath the Royal Road overbridge.</p>
      <p>At around 9.38am, a projectile has come through the vehicle’s windscreen and struck her in the face.</p>
      <p>“Our enquiries so far have determined the projectile has come from a high powered rifle in the nearby area,” says Acting Detective Senior Sergeant Nick Salter.</p>
      <p>“However, we would like to reassure the public that we do not believe the vehicle was specifically targeted.</p>
      <p>Analysis suggests the bullet has ricocheted through the windscreen.”</p>
      <p>The driver was initially taken to Auckland City Hospital with serious injuries, but is now in a stable condition.</p>
      <p>Her injuries are not life threatening.</p>
      <p>Police have been conducting a number of enquiries since this morning’s incident, including area enquiries around the Royal Road area.</p>
      <p>The woman’s vehicle has also been forensically examined as part of those enquiries.</p>
      <p>Acting Detective Senior Sergeant Salter says Police would like anyone with information to come forward.</p>
      <p>“There were a number of vehicles travelling on the motorway at that time and we would like to hear from any drivers that witnessed the incident.</p>
      <p>“We would also like to hear from anyone who on the eastern side of State Highway 16 and in the Royal Road area who may have heard a loud bang or noise around the time of this incident.</p>
      <p>“Anyone who also witnessed any suspicious behaviour in this area should get in touch with Henderson Police by phoning the 105 number.”</p>
      <p>Information can be passed to Police anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
