        <b>Talks to end a row between speed camera van operators and their employers GoSafe have adjourned with 'no resolution forthcoming'.</b>
      </p>
      <p>GoSafe staff <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/gosafe-speed-camera-operators-stage-72-hour-strike-918666">have held a number of stoppages</a></b> in recent months as part of a dispute centered around union recognition and working conditions.</p>
      <p>Staff have previously claimed they are confined to their vans for up to 11 hours at a time without proper toilet facilities.</p>
      <p>Following talks, both sides failed to reach agreement at the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) earlier - with GoSafe saying "no resolution was forthcoming".</p>
      <p>However, the company said it's still open to finding a solution.</p>
      <p>In a statement, GoSafe said: "We remain available to explore how the current staff representative body and SIPTU could work together for those employees that each represent.</p>
      <p>"GoSafe plays a vital role in road safety and that is down to the professionalism and commitment of our full team. Road safety must take precedence. We remain ready and open to play our part in bringing about a conclusion to this matter."</p>
      <p>SIPTU previouslyÂ suspended planned industrial action by GoSafe staff to allow for the WRC talks.</p>
