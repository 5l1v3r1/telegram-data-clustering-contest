      <p>Over the years, we've posted about (but sadly never had the opportunity to try) the <a href="https://downtownhotel.ca/sourtoe-cocktail/">Sourtoe Cocktail</a>, the infamous drink containing preserved human toes that's served at the Downtown Hotel in Canada's Yukon territory. Now we must report that "Captain" Dick Stevenson, the bartender who first served the Sourtoe Cocktail, has died at age of 89. It turns out though that Stevenson, truly a generous soul, had bequeathed all ten of his toes to the bar for future use in the curious cocktail. From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/18/sour-toe-cocktail-canadian-bartender-captain-dick-dying-wish">The Guardian</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Dad is a publicity hound and he just said he was going to be more famous after he’s dead,” Dixie Stevenson told the Canadian Press as she prepared to take her father’s ashes – and toes – to the Downtown Hotel in Dawson City, where the infamous drink was first served. <br/><br/>The drink consists of a mummified human toe at the bottom of a whiskey shot, and patrons at the hotel must let the tip of the toe touch their lips in order to qualify as having successfully consumed the cocktail.<br/><br/>While Stevenson initially believed no more than a few people would try his concoction, the Sourtoe Cocktail Club now has nearly 100,000 inductees. <br/><br/>A toe-shaped urn, containing Stevenson’s ashes, will go on display at the hotel.</blockquote>
