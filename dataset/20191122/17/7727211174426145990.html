      <h1>Cowboy roofer slapped with community order after conning family</h1>
      <h2>William Ball, 62, pleaded guilty to three charges after lying about works he intended to carry out</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:57:15+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/kate-lally/" target="_blank">Kate Lally</a></address>
      <p>A dishonest workman was slapped with a community order after deceiving customers about the work he intended to do on their roof.</p>
      <p>A court heard William Ball's pitch to customers led them to make a ‘transactional decision’ they would not otherwise have agreed to.</p>
      <p>Ball, 62, of Longton Drive, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/formby">Formby</a> , pleaded guilty to three charges of being a trader engaged in a commercial practice and misleading customers with false information on October 30.</p>
      <p>The charges, brought by <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/sefton-council">Sefton Council</a> , related to roofing work he carried out at a home on Woodside Avenue in Ainsdale.</p>

      <p>Each charge states Ball's presentation to the customer ‘deceived or was likely to deceive them’, and caused or was likely to have caused them to take a transactional decision they would not otherwise have taken.</p>

      <p>The first charge said in May 2018 he sent a text to the occupant saying all his roofing felt was badly worn and could do with being replaced along with wooden batons that have corroded due to age - when he intended to only replace felt and batons on part of the original roof.</p>
      <p>The second said Ball told the customer that he could replace all roofing felt and batons at the property and reuse the old tiles - when he intended to only re-felt and baton a portion of the original roof.</p>
      <p>And the third said that, in June 2018, Ball had undertaken works that were not as had been described to the customer, namely that he had replaced felt and batons on part of the roof and not the full roof.</p>
      <p>District Judge Shaw sentenced Ball to 100 hours unpaid work at Liverpool Magistrates Court yesterday (Thursday).</p>
