      <p>Accra, Nov. 22, GNA - An Accra Circuit Court has remanded a 25-year-old man for allegedly defiling a ten-year old mentally retarded girl.</p>
      <p>The plea of Mugis Karim was not taken and he will make his next appearance on December 15.</p>
      <p>Police Detective Sergeant Opoku Aniagyei told the Court presided over by Mrs Rita Abrokwa Doko that the complainant in the case is the head teacher of the victim’s school.</p>
      <p>The prosecution said Karim is unemployed and a resident of Agbogbloshie in Accra.</p>
      <p> He said on November 19, this year, at about 1200 hours whilst the school was on break, the girl went to a refused dump, ten metres away from her school, close to the big Odorna gutter to ease herself.</p>
      <p>Prosecution said she met the accused also collecting things from the dumping site where he lured her into a nearby wooden structure.</p>
      <p>The prosecution said he made her removed her panties, bent her down and had sex with her from behind.</p>
      <p>He said after the act, Karim gave the girl GH¢2.00 and left the place, unknown to him some artisans opposite the gutter were watching them.</p>
      <p>The prosecution said they then caused the arrest of Karim, beat him up and later handed him over to the school’s authorities together with the victim.</p>
      <p>Prosecution said a formal complaint was lodged with the Domestic Violence and Victim’s Support Unit of the Ghana Police Service.</p>
      <p>He said the victim was issued with a medical report form for the school authorities to send her to the hospital for examination, treatment and report.</p>
