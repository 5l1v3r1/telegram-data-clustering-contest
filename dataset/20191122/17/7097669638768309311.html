      <h1>Dog 'drives' car in reverse for an hour after being left alone</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:23:37+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Chelsea Ritschel</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/dog">dog</a> left alone in a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/car">car</a> circled a cul-de-sac in reverse during an hour-long ride.</p>
      <p>According to neighbours in Port St Lucie, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Florida">Florida</a>, at first glance it appeared that there was no-one in the car which was moving in reverse around their circular block.</p>
      <p>However, once police arrived and stopped the car they realised that there was a passenger - a black Labrador who had accidentally shifted the vehicle into reverse when his owner stepped out.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, the dog was unharmed, although he did manage to cause some minor property damage during his ride, according to <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/region-st-lucie-county/canine-joyride-port-st-lucie-dog-hits-car-into-reverse-drives-in-circles-for-nearly-an-hour">WPTV</a>.</p>
      <p>In addition to moving some bricks in front of a neighbour’s home, he also hit a neighbour’s mailbox and a trash can, which the dog’s owner has reportedly promised to replace.</p>

      <p>“He was doing pretty good until he hit the mailbox,” neighbour Anna Sabol told the outlet. “He went around for about an hour without hitting anything at all.”</p>
      <p>Police were able to stop the dog’s journey by opening the driver’s side door with the passcode - at which point the pooch jumped out.</p>
      <p>According to witnesses, the pup seemed happy about its experience.</p>
      <p>“I saw the dog jump out of the car, wagging his tail,” Sabol said, adding that she thinks the dog deserves a driving license. “I was like: ‘Okay, good driving!’”</p>
