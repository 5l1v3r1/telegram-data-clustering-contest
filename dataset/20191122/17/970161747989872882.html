      <p>The Nintendo eShop has started a Black Friday sale with 30% off Breath Of The Wild and Mario Odyssey, as well as over 150 other deals.</p>
      <p>Everyone knows that Nintendo products are rarely ever discounted, as unlike most other games their demand remains steady for years after release.</p>
      <p>There is the odd exception though and Nintendo does make at least a bit of an effort during Black Friday, as you can see from the discounted eShop titles below and the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Nintendo-eShop/Nintendo-eShop-Sale/Nintendo-eShop-Sale-1460557.html">full list here</a>.</p>
      <p>In typical Nintendo fashion they’re not calling it a Black Friday deal, even though that’s what it is, since it runs from Friday, 22 November at 2pm till Sunday, 1 December at 11.59pm.</p>
      <h3>Best Nintendo Switch Black Friday eShop deals</h3>
      <p>Super Mario Odyssey – £34.99<br/>The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild – £41.99<br/>Cadence Of Hyrule: Crypt of the NecroDancer – £15.74<br/>Xenoblade Chronicles 2 – £34.99<br/>New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe – £34.99<br/>Dragon Quest Builders 2 – £34.99<br/>Dark Souls Remastered – £20.99<br/>Dragon Ball FighterZ – £14.99<br/>FIFA 20 Legacy Edition – £31.49<br/>Sid Meier’s Civilization 6 – £22.49<br/>Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate – £22.49</p>
      <p>When it comes to console bundles though there’s very little to get excited about so far, and this deal for a <a href="https://fave.co/2NQGPsD">Nintendo Switch and Pokémon Sword for £299 at Currys PC World</a> is about the best there is. It’s only a saving of £25 but you might be able to do better than that when GAME’s deals go live on Monday.</p>

      <p>It’s not exactly sexy but the best hardware deal at the moment is probably for SanDisk micro SD cards, which are expensive but essential given the very finite amount of storage space on the Switch itself.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://amzn.to/2Oa4Ivu">SanDisk Ultra 128GB micro SD card for £12.99</a>
        <br/>
        <a href="https://amzn.to/34csLiP">SanDisk Ultra 200GB micro SD card for £18.99</a>
        <br/>
        <a href="https://amzn.to/2QHsCA7">SanDisk Ultra 512GB micro SD card for £64.99</a>
      </p>
      <p>One extra bonus though is that the <a href="https://mynintendostore.nintendo.co.uk/nintendo-entertainment-system-controllers.html">replica NES controllers</a> are currently 20% off on Nintendo’s website – making them £39.99 for a pair – although you still have to be a member of Nintendo Switch Online to buy them.</p>
