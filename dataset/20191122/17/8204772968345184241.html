      <h2>Tusla grateful such a large number of people have got in touch</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:58:54+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/ronan-mcgreevy-7.1837400" target="_blank">Ronan McGreevy</a></address>
      <p>A public appeal for potential foster parents to come forward has resulted in 350 inquiries from interested people.</p>
      <p>It followed Tusla’s first National Fostering Week recently which sought to increase public awareness about fostering and recruit new foster carers.</p>
      <p>Tusla’s service director Patricia Finlay said the child protection agency was “deeply grateful that such a large number of people have got in touch with Tusla requesting information on how to become a foster carer”.</p>
      <p>There are currently 4,254 foster carers in the Republic of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news">Ireland</a>, but there are shortages in many places, particularly in the greater Dublin area.</p>
      <p>Tusla has made it easier for potential foster parents by providing insurance cover from the State to cover their role. It is also now providing an emergency out-of-hours phone line to support foster carers.</p>
      <p>Foster parents are paid €325 a week for children under 12 and €352 for children aged between 12 and 18 and they also receive child benefit entitlements. Each child in foster care will have their own medical card.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Ms+Finlay">Ms Finlay</a> added: “ Tusla is very keen to ensure that existing, and a new generation of foster carers feel rewarded and valued for the hugely important and positive influence they have on the lives of children in their care.</p>
      <p>“It is essential that we provide them with optimum support, guidance, training and encouragement in the course of their family life.”</p>
      <p>Members of the public wishing to contact Tusla about fostering can call freephone 1800 226 771, email tusla.fostering@tusla.ie or visit fostering.ie.</p>
