        <b>President Uhuru Kenyatta by the powers vested in him by the Constitution has the mandate to appoint chancellors to all public universities in the country.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since taking over power in 2013, Uhuru has appointed a number of chancellors notably billionaire Narendra Raval (Egerton University) and Joseph Mathu (<a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46645-juja-police-spot-after-another-jkuat-student-stabbed-death">Jkuat</a>) but reserved one for himself, the Kibabii University Chancellor.</p>
      <p>He has held the position from the time he chartered the university on November 14, 2015, and never missed any but one graduation ceremony where he has <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46703-graduands-brutal-attack-hours-uhurus-visit">always given hundreds of millions</a> for the upgrade of the institution's facilities.  </p>
      <p>Kibabii University, was initiallyset up as Kibabii Teachers’ Training College but with recommendations from community leaders it was trabsformed into a university college with all trainee teachers being transferred to Eregi Teachers' Training College in Kakamega.</p>

      <p>On September 19, 2007, President Mwai Kibaki presided over a groundbreaking ceremony at the proposed site of the long-awaited Kibabii Teachers Training College in Bungoma South District.</p>
      <p>Due to a request by the leaders from Bungoma County, Kibaki declared that the newly constructed facilities for Kibabii Diploma Teachers’ College be converted to Kibabii University College, a constituent College of the Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology.</p>
      <p> The university was granted it's Charter by President Kenyatta in November 2015 where he also allocated Ksh 100 million for development of facilities.</p>
      <p>In 2016 he presided over the university's first graduation ceremony where he conferred 742 graduates with various degrees.</p>
      <p>During the same ceremony, he also announced an allocation of Ksh300 million to improve the university’s teaching facilities.</p>
      <p>The only graduation ceremony that president Kenyatta missed war the institutions 3rd ceremony but he was represented by the then CS for Education Ambassador Amina Mohammed on November 23 2018.</p>
      <p>In 2018 the president invited the university's management to a meeting at State House Nairobi and gave the institution Ksh100 million to equip laboratories and improve water supply to the university. The council chairman, Ernest Mwangi, and the vice-chancellor, Isaac Odeo, led the delegation.</p>
      <p>By him taking up the position as the chancellor to the university, President Kenyatta revived the memory of former President Daniel Arap Moi who was the chancellor to all public universities, a position shunned by Mwai Kibaki.</p>
