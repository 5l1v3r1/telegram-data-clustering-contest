      <h1>Stormzy Taps Ed Sheeran &amp; Burna Boy for New Visual &amp; Single, "Own It"</h1>
      <h2>Our latest preview of his ‘Heavy Is The Head’ LP.</h2>

      <p>Earlier this week, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/stormzy">Stormzy</a> fully detailed his second full-length album <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/stormzy-heavy-is-the-head-new-album-tracklist-release-date-songs"><i>Heavy Is The Head</i></a>. The follow-up to 2017’s <i>Gang Signs &amp; Prayer</i>, <i>Heavy Is The Head</i> is on course to give fans 16 new songs to digest, including collaborations with Ed Sheeran, Burna Boy, H.E.R., Headie One, Tiana Major9, YEBBA and Aitch. Continuing to support his forthcoming LP, Stormzy is swiftly following up the aforementioned news by introducing a Nathan James Tettey-directed music video for <i>Heavy Is The Head</i>‘s latest major single, the <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/ed-sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a>- and <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/burna-boy">Burna Boy</a>-assisted “Own It.”</p>
      <p>“Every single line, every melody, lyric and sample has a purpose,” Stormzy explained to <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/men-of-the-year/article/stormzy-interview-2019"><i>GQ</i></a> last month, sharing some insight into the creative direction of Heavy Is The Head. “This is phase two. You know when people say that some rappers have filler songs or filler lyrics? There won’t be any of that. When I sit in the car with the mandem and listen back to it, all of it has a purpose.”</p>
      <p>You can take a look at the new music video for Stormzy, Ed Sheeran and Burna Boy’s collaborative single “Own It” above. Stormzy’s sophomore studio album <i>Heavy Is The Head</i> will hit streaming services and similar platforms on December 13 via #MERKY and Atlantic Records.</p>
