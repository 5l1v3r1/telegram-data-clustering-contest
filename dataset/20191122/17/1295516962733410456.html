      <h1>Spider-Man Concept Art Offers Hi-Res Look at Night Monkey's Mask</h1>

      <p>Marvel Studios' Head of Visual Development and concept artist for <a href="http://cbr.com/tag/spider-man-far-from-home"><i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i></a>, Ryan Meinerding, has offered a close-up look at Peter Parker's "Night Monkey" mask (aka, the Stealth Suit).</p>
      <p>The artist initially <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ryan_meinerding_art/?utm_source=ig_embed">posted the images on his Instagram</a> stating, "Stealth suit mask design! These were images illustrating [Jon Watts]' wonderful idea of the flip up lenses." Aside from revealing that Jon Watts (director of<a href="http://cbr.com/tag/spider-man-homecoming"><i> Spider-Man: Homecoming</i></a> and <i>Far From Home</i>) initially pitched the idea for the suit's lenses to flip up and down, the art also puts into perspective the incredible attention to detail bestowed by the artists of Marvel Studios.</p>

      <p>Debuting in <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i>, the name<i> </i>"Night Monkey" was given to the webhead shortly after donning the Stealth Suit and battling the fire-wielding Elemental (which was later discovered to actually be one of Mysterio's tricky illusions). Since Peter decided to leave behind his classic red and blue suit for his class trip to Europe, Nick Fury gifted Peter the Stealth Suit so the globe-trotting web-slinger could fight bad guys while still concealing his identity.</p>
      <p>Helmed by Jon Watts, <i>Spider-Man: Far from Home</i> stars Tom Holland, Samuel L. Jackson, Zendaya, Cobie Smulders, Jon Favreau, J.B. Smoove, Jacob Batalon and Martin Starr, with Marisa Tomei and Jake Gyllenhaal. The film is available now on Digital and 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray and DVD.</p>
