      </p>
      <p>The estate of <i>Nightmare On Elm Street</i> creator Wes Craven are looking into a new movie and TV show based on the horror classic.</p>
      <p>Craven’s estate reclaimed the rights to the film earlier this year. Now, according to <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/exclusives/3594940/wes-cravens-estate-begins-taking-nightmare-elm-street-pitches-exclusive/"><i>Bloody Disgusting</i></a>, after the acquisition they’re looking at pitches for both a movie remake and a TV show likely to air on streaming service HBO Max.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Since the original film introduced the world to Freddie Krueger in 1984, and with the rights taken away from Craven, the franchise has seen six sequels, a crossover and a 2010 remake before Craven passed away in 2015.</p>

      <p>The new development follows a recent pledge from <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/lord-of-the-rings"><i>Lord Of The Rings</i></a> star <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/elijah-wood-says-wants-remake-nightmare-elm-street-2565326">Elijah Wood, who wants to produce a new reboot of <i>Nightmare On Elm Street</i></a> with his production company SpectreVision.</p>
      <p>“It definitely has that aspect of pie in the sky, of getting to play in a certain sandbox, you know?” Wood said of the potential to make a new film in the franchise.</p>
      <p>“It’s a universe and a character and an idea that would be a fun sandbox to play in. It’s trying to do something different.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/the-movies-blog/horror-villains-michael-myers-pinhead-leatherface-2563155"><i>NME</i> recently named Freddie Krueger one of the scariest horror villains of all time</a>.</p>
