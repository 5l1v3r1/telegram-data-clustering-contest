      <p>While the peculiar-looking <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/tesla/cybertruck">Tesla Cybertruck</a> is currently stealing all the spotlight, it wasn't the only electric off-roader that debuted this week.</p>
      <p>At the 2019 LA Auto Show, US startup company Bollinger showcased the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/meet-the-worlds-most-capable-ev-pickup-truck-and-suv">B1 and B2 electric off-roaders</a> to the public for the first time, and they look extremely rugged in the metal thanks to riveted aluminum panels and massive off-road tires. The B1 is a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/hummer-set-to-return-as-all-electric-truck">Hummer-style electric SUV</a>, while the B2 takes the form of an electric pickup with a 5.9-inch longer cargo bed.</p>

      <p>On paper, the specifications are very impressive. Both models use a 120-kWh battery pack that powers two electric motors, with one on each axle to create a four-wheel-drive system. This setup produces a total of 614 horsepower and 668 lb-ft of torque, enabling the rugged off-roaders to do 0-62 mph in 4.5 seconds and achieve a top speed of 100 mph. On a single charge, both models will last 200 miles.</p>

      <p>Don't expect many creature comforts inside, because the Bollinger B1 and B2 were built to be capable off-roaders rather than luxury SUVs. Standard equipment includes 17-inch alloy wheels, air-conditioning, and Bluetooth connectivity, with heated seats, glass roof panels, and a winch also available as optional extras.</p>
      <p>Off-road, the Bollinger B1 and B2 boast impressive capability, with a 52 approach angle and 43 departure angle, as well as 15 inches of ground clearance. Both models also have payloads of 5,201 pounds and towing capacities of 7,500 pounds. There is a downside, however, and that's the price. The Bolling B1 and B2 start at a whopping $125,000, making them more expensive than their rivals. For comparison, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-has-400-mile-range-and-mind-blowing-performance">Rivian R1T</a> starts at $69,000 and the Tesla Cybertruck starts at $39,900.</p>
