      <h1>Fiona Hill Calls ‘Globalist’ Description “Anti-Semitic” Despite Writing For a Media Outlet Called ‘The Globalist’</h1>
      <h2>Well, this is awkward.</h2>

        <b>During her testimony in the impeachment hearings this week, Fiona Hill dismissed charges she was a “globalist” by referring to the term as an “anti-Semitic” conspiracy theory, despite the fact that she writes for a publication literally called ‘The Globalist’.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hill was responding to a question by Democratic Representative for Illinois Raja Krishnamoorthi, who quoted Hill’s earlier deposition in which she complained about Roger Stone labeling her “the globalist leftist [George] Soros insider.”</p>
      <p>Hill claimed that “a conspiracy” had been launched against her and that ‘globalist’ was an anti-Semitic trope, while admitting that she was a “leftist maybe,” but implying she was not a globalist.</p>
      <p>“This is the longest-running anti-Semitic trope that we have in history, and a trope against Mr. Soros was also created for political purposes, and this is the new Protocols of The Elders of Zion,” Hill said.</p>

      <p>This statement is somewhat at odds with Hill literally being a <a href="https://www.theglobalist.com/contributors/fiona-hill/">contributing writer</a> for a publication called ‘The Globalist’.</p>
      <p>Stone also previously asserted that Hill was serving as George Soros’ “mole” under the supervision of former NSA adviser H.R. McMaster.</p>

      <p>Hill is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, which is considered to be one of the pre-eminent globalist institutions in the United States.</p>
