      <p>Big sales day is coming once again with the emergence of Black Friday in a week, but most of the e-shops and manufacturers are already prepared for the big day in advance. And the famous laptop and tablet makers <a href="http://www.gizchina.com/tag/chuwi">CHUWI</a> are of course no exception and will be offering quite a sizable discounts for most of their product portfolio. The price slashes can go as high as $76 so it’s certainly worth checking out their Black Friday offers.</p>
      <p>Most of the CHUWI’s major sales deals will kick off directly on Black Friday on November 28th and will last until December 2nd. So you will have few days to fully decide about the best deals out there, but it’s still recommended to scout the deals in advance so you know what to aim for. Full details are of course available on <a href="https://promotion.chuwi.com/chuwi-blackfriday/">their official website</a>, so make sure to visit that too. And now for the comprehensive table of the available CHUWI products on sale, you will see Mini PC models sprinkled there too in between the usual laptop and tablet pieces.</p>

      <p>Probably the most appealing category of CHUWI products are the laptop models and most of them are in the $200-$400 price range. So we can easily divide them into simple recommendations : if you want a cheap durable one with good price/performance ratio and under $200 then go for the HeroBook model. Under $300 section will give you LapBook Pro with better specs and design, but the pinacle will be reached with under $400 with the great looking AeroBook sporting the Core M processor. HappyBlack Friday hunting !</p>
