      <p>After the massive success of their <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/zeds-dead/">Zeds Dead</a> collaboration "Lift Me Up" and the release of their second studio album <i>Only In Dreams, </i>bass dons <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/delta-heavy">Delta Heavy</a> continue the onslaught by dropping the visuals for single "Take Me Home."<br/><br/>This song just so happens to be the final track on the album, and it definitely leaves you with a good feeling once all is said and done. The visuals carry the same vibe, showing the story of two toy dolls living and falling in love inside an arcade claw machine. Written and directed by Kun-I Chang and Shih-Wen Lin, the stunning visuals serve up a gripping narrative from its central characters.<br/><br/>Itâ€™s the ideal way for Delta Heavy to round off another mammoth year as they prepare to welcome in 2020.
