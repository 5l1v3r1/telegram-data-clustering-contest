      <p>Ricky Gervais will be making a triumphant return to the Beverly Hilton Hotel to host the 2020 edition of the Golden Globe Awards, a topic that came up when star-co-creator of “The Office” paid a visit to “The Graham Norton Show” on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Gervais, 58, has hosted the Golden Globes four times — in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2016 — and earned a reputation for jabbing celebs a little too hard with jokes that hit too close to home (in particular he took heat for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CT53xvOFY">a joke about Caitlyn Jenner</a>) “showing great bravery in breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes,” while pointing out that she “didn’t do a lot for women drivers,” referencing her involvement in a 2015 car crash in which the other driver was killed.</p>
      <p>While there are some who believe he may have gone too far, Gervais pointed out that if that were the case, he wouldn’t have been invited back, and told Norton that he never rehearses what he’s going to say so producers don’t have the opportunity to censor any of his jokes.</p>

      <p>“When I do it, I’m going to say what I want. I don’t have to rehearse. And they say that’s fine,” Gervais explained, although he did admit, “I do have to tell a lawyer it just before I go on.”</p>
      <p>However, Gervais was proud to report that he’d never been successfully sued for anything he’s said. “Because I know the law. I know what I can get away with. I know what I can say,” he explained.</p>
      <p>“I don’t libel anyone,” he added. “And I’ve never had a complaint upheld. See? I know what I’m doing.”</p>
      <p>Quipped Gervais: “People say, ‘Why do you go through so much trouble to offend people?’ And I say, ‘It’s no trouble.'”</p>
