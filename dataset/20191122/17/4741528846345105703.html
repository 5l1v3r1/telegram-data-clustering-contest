      <p><b>Possible reasons for Madavo’s resignation</b>: Madavo’s resignation could be linked to a function of bad press which might have damaged his <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-za/money/news/pic-exec-fidelis-madavo-suspended-inquiry-told/ar-BBSzSR0">reputation with the Dangote Cement Board</a>. In January, Madavo was suspended by the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) in South Africa with regards to the Ayo transaction, a R4.3 billion payment to fund the technology company which was flagged as controversial.</p>
      <p>Madavo’s suspension followed an internal audit and ongoing investigation by the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) which President Cyril Ramaphosa signed off on last year after reports of alleged impropriety and dubious investments at the PIC. Fidelis Madavo was suspended with immediate effect even before giving his testimony.</p>
