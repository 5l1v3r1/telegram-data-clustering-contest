      <h1>Why Downs Star Wants To Change Positions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:31:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:31</time> by <a rel="author">Mazola Molefe</a></address>
      <p>Rivaldo Coetzee has officially made up his mind about his best position, revealing that he has no real intentions to return to playing as a centre back.  </p>
      <p>Even his Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has publicly argued that the only way the 23-year-old can attract interest abroad is if he switches to defensive midfield.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Mosimane began experimenting with Coetzee late last season and the Bafana Bafana international, whose dream of moving to Scottish Premier League outfit Celtic two years ago collapsed after he failed a medical, collected a few Man of the Match awards along the way and received rave reviews from fans, media and pundits.   </p>
      <p>“If it’s up to me, then yes I would like to play there,” said Coetzee.</p>
      <p>“I think I can contribute a lot to the team in that position, especially now that I am training in that position almost every day and that helps me to improve on it. There’s obviously a few things I need to work on myself, which the coaching staff is helping me with.”</p>
      <p>‘Riva’ said he doesn’t mind the competition – alongside captain Hlompho Kekana, Tiyani Mabunda, Andile Jali and Sammy Seabi.</p>
      <p>“I am really enjoying playing there. The competition is always good for the team because that’s how I can improve. I don’t really want to go back to playing centre back. I want to be further forward,” he added. </p>
