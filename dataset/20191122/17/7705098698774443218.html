      <h1>Colin Trevorrow Reveals Which Scene in The Last Jedi Was His Idea</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:28:59+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:28</time> by <a rel="author">Tudor Leonte</a></address>
      <p>After his work on 2015’s <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/jurassic-world"><b>Jurassic World</b></a>, Colin Trevorrow came really close to becoming part of the <b><a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-wars">Star Wars</a> </b>franchise. But though he ultimately left the helm of <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker"><b>The Rise of Skywalker</b></a> due to creative differences, some of his ideas influenced the final outcome of the two last installments in the <b>Star Wars </b>original saga. In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/colin-trevorrow-star-wars-rise-skywalker-last-jedi/">Empire</a>, Trevorrow revealed the suggestion he gave to <b><a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-the-last-jedi">The Last Jedi</a> </b>director Rian Johnson.</p>
      <p>“I just asked Rian if he could include a little moment where Rey and Poe meet for the first time,” he said. “They’re such beloved characters, it felt right for them to have some history in the next movie. I thought the way he did it was perfect.”</p>
      <p>Eventually, Johnson accepted Trevorrow’s idea and made Rey and Poe meet right at the very end of <b>The Last</b> <b>Jedi, </b>when they introduce themselves.</p>

      <p>Trevorrow was also asked to reveal more about his ideas which ended up being included in the upcoming <b>The Rise Of Skywalker</b>, but the director chose not to go into details as he felt it was not his place. Even though he was replaced by J.J. Abrams, Trevorrow will get a story credit as an acknowledgment for his work. But he let something slip about the upcoming movie.</p>
      <p>“Bringing back the Emperor was an idea JJ brought to the table when he came on board,” Trevorrow added. “It’s honestly something I never considered. I commend him for it. This was a tough story to unlock, and he found the key.”</p>
      <p><b>Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker </b>is out on December 19th. What do you think about Colin Trevorrow’s suggestion for <b>The Last Jedi</b>? Let us know your impression in the comments section below.</p>
