      <p>A boy has been injured in an accident involving a van in a busy Burton street.</p>
      <p>The incident happened earlier this evening in Shobnall Street, Burton, with police and ambulance crews called to the scene.</p>
      <p>Emergency services confirmed a boy had been being treated for injuries.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Staffordshire Police, said: "We were called at 3.50pm to reports of a collision on Shobnall Street in Burton.</p>
      <p>"It was between a van and a pedestrian. The pedestrian was injured."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: "We were called at 3.47pm to reports of a road traffic collision involving a pedestrian and a van."</p>
      <p>He said one ambulance crew treated the boy for non-serious injuries at the scene.</p>
      <p>The accident was also causing delays for commuters as the evening rush-hour got under way. Shobnall Street was partially blocked in both directions from Dallow Street to Saw Mill Way while the crash was dealt with.</p>
      <p>A resident who did not want to be named said: "I didn't see anything happen but I heard the sirens from the ambulance and police.</p>
      <p>"I looked through the window and could see the blue lights and them all stood near a van and I think it had its hazards on. I didn't want to just stare though because I wouldn't like it if I were in an accident."</p>
