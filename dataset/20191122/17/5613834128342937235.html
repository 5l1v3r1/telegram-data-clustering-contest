      <h1>Kathy Bates Praises Lizzy Caplan’s Performance in “Castle Rock”; “She IS Annie Wilkes”</h1>

      <p>If there’s one standout highlight of this season of Hulu’s<b> “Castle Rock”</b> it’s unquestionably the performance we’ve been getting from <b>Lizzy Caplan</b>, who has absolutely transformed into <i>Misery</i> villain Annie Wilkes. Caplan has been tasked with playing a much more nuanced and even sympathetic version of the character, and if her performance doesn’t at least land her an Emmy nomination next year, well, let’s just say it’d be further confirmation that the negative bias towards the horror genre is very real. But that’s a conversation for another day.</p>
      <p>Caplan was needless to say stepping into big shoes when she signed on for “Castle Rock,” as<b> Kathy Bates</b> won an Oscar for playing Annie Wilkes back in the 90s. So what does Bates think of Caplan’s small screen performance as the character she made famous?</p>
      <p>Bates took to Twitter last night to rave about Caplan’s take on Annie Wilkes.</p>
      <blockquote>“Lizzy Caplan hits it out of the park,” Bates tweeted. “She IS Annie Wilkes. Terrifying and human. Sometimes she makes me feel all oogie!”</blockquote>
      <p>You and us both, Kathy. You and us both.</p>
      <p>New episodes of “Castle Rock” bring misery to Hulu on Wednesdays.</p>
