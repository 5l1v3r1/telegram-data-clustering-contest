      <p>CELTIC HAVE BEEN fined €15,000 by Uefa for obscene chanting and displaying an “illicit banner” in their Europa League win against Lazio at Celtic Park last month.</p>
      <p>Home supporters unveiled several banners ahead of the game, including one depicting former Italian prime minister Benito Mussolini hanging upside down.</p>
      <p>Another contained a message in Italian that translated to “f*** off”.</p>
      <p>Uefa’s control, ethics and disciplinary body has also fined Lazio €10,000 for “illicit chanting” during the meeting on 23 October, which Celtic won 2-1.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Club Brugge have been fined €14,000 for breaching safety regulations by blocking the stairways during their home Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain a month ago.</p>
      <p>Ligue 1 champions PSG have been told to pay €50,000 and threatened with a one-match away ban for supporters if they offend again in the next 12 months after setting off fireworks in the same match.</p>
