      <h1>FCC bans Chinese telecoms Huawei and ZTE from access to federal broadband subsidies</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:04:15+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author">Jerry Dunleavy</a></address>
      <p>The Federal Communications Commission banned wireless providers from using federal subsidies to purchase any equipment or services from Chinese technology companies Huawei and ZTE on Friday.</p>
      <p>The agency’s unanimous 5-0 <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/events/2019/11/november-2019-open-commission-meeting">vote</a> concluded the two Chinese telecom giants companies pose a threat to national security and blocked them from receiving any money from the U.S. government’s $8.5 billion <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/universal-service-fund">Universal Service Fund</a>. The fund subsidizes building broadband infrastructure to increase internet access across the United States in underserved areas. Only 65% of residents in rural areas and 60% on tribal lands <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/about-fcc/fcc-initiatives/bridging-digital-divide-all-americans">have</a> high-speed service, compared with 97% in urban areas.</p>
      <p>Chairman Ajit Pai pointed to the close ties Huawei and ZTE have to the Chinese Communist government, as the agency prepares for wider use of the fifth generation of wireless networks, known as “5G.”</p>
      <p>“We know the hidden backdoors to our networks, routers, switches, and other network equipment can allow a hostile adversary to inject versus and other malware, steal private data of Americans, spy on U.S. companies and more,” Pai said. “If the Chinese government is willing to use its leverage over things like professional basketball and Taiwanese flag emojis, imagine what could happen if we allowed Chinese company equipment into our 5G networks.”</p>
      <p>Other commissioners agreed the agency has more work to do. Jessica Rosenworcel said the U.S. needs a national plan for dealing with these threats and worried the Trump administration might reverse this progress in a trade deal with China. Geoffrey Starks called for an FCC national security taskforce and noted Huawei and ZTE equipment was already embedded in broadband infrastructure, especially in rural areas, and the FCC needs to help wireless carriers transition from Chinese technology.</p>
      <p><a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/11130351518674/Attorney%20General%20Letter%20FCC%20Docket%2018-89.pdf">The DOJ has backed the FCC’s proposal</a> to replace any broadband equipment already in place that uses the two Chinese companies, pointing to pointed to criminal proceedings involving both companies.</p>
      <p>But the FCC’s bold move against Huawei highlights the Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/trumps-surprise-huawei-u-turn-stirs-unease-amid-5g-fears">contradictory policy</a> toward the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lindsey-graham-no-way-in-hell-us-allies-should-use-chinese-5g-technology">Chinese telecom</a>. On Monday, the Commerce Department granted another 90-day extension on allowing the granting of licenses which allow companies to sell goods to Huawei, even though the U.S. government placed the company on an “entity list” — essentially a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-neuters-huawei">black list</a> — in May amid claims Huawei is “engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests.” The U.S. has granted repeated reprieves to Huawei since then.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross <a href="https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/6106349226001/#sp=show-clips">defended</a> the Trump administration's decision, saying nothing the U.S. had done would help Huawei’s 5G abilities, and noted the agency had received "290-something requests for specific licenses." As of Wednesday, the Commerce Department had processed half the requests it received and half of the processed requests <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-huawei/microsoft-granted-license-to-export-mass-market-software-to-huawei-idUSKBN1XV2LE">were approved</a>. The others were denied. And Microsoft said on Thursday the Commerce Department granted its request for a license to export mass-market software to Huawei.</p>
      <p>The ability of Microsoft and other large companies to begin selling products to Huawei again will be a relief to a company which had been feeling a squeeze from the U.S.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/business/huawei-us-ban.html">considering</a> banning other federal agencies from doing business with Huawei, but Trump has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/trump-roils-markets-with-comments-on-china-trade-huawei-idUSKCN1UZ1LK">shown an openness</a> to using Huawei as a bargaining chip in trade talks with China.</p>
      <p>The DOJ and U.S. intelligence agencies believe that Huawei and ZTE are working hand-in-hand with the Chinese government, potentially giving China's surveillance state access to hardware and networks around the world. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2019/05/291564.htm">repeatedly warned</a> European allies against using Huawei's 5G technology.</p>
      <p>DOJ has <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-tries-to-disqualify-ex-obama-official-from-defending-chinas-huawei">increased its scrutiny</a> of China’s activities in recent years, charging an increased number of people in China-related espionage cases, cracking down on China-based hacking schemes, prosecuting Chinese efforts to steal trade secrets, and more. Despite Barr’s trip to the United Kingdom in late July, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/barr-and-five-eyes-pledge-unity-on-emerging-threats-but-questions-on-huawei-and-isis-remain">disagreements</a> over the use of Huawei technology remain between the U.S. and its closest intelligence allies.</p>
      <p>The U.S. government is also seeking the extradition from Canada of Huawei’s chief financial officer Wanzhou Meng, who faces federal charges for an alleged scheme to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran. James Cole, former deputy attorney general under the Obama administration, represents Huawei in that criminal case, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-tries-to-disqualify-ex-obama-official-from-defending-chinas-huawei">despite efforts from the DOJ</a> to have him removed.</p>
      <p>And Samir Jain, former senior director for cybersecurity policy for the National Security Council under the Obama administration, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/top-obama-officials-aid-chinese-firm-targeted-by-trump-order">registered as Huawei’s lobbyist</a> this year.</p>
