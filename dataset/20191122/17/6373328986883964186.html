        <b>God of Rock, thank you for this chance for Jack Black to kick ass, he wants to play The Thing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The Tenacious D frontman is currently doing the rounds promoting <i>Jumanji: The Next Level</i>, the sequel to the hit 2016 follow-up starring Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview, when quizzed about which superhero he’d love to play in the future, The Thing emerged as a favourite.</p>

      <p>The Thing is part of the Fantastic Four, Marvel’s classic comicbook team. Made from rocks and insanely strong, he’s always a bit more lighthearted and hammy (he’d be a good pairing with Smart Hulk after <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>).</p>
      <p>When asked if there was any character he’d particularly like to play in the MCU, Black told <a href="https://screenrant.com/jack-black-marvel-movies-cast-kingpin-thing/?utm_source=SR-FB-P&amp;utm_medium=Social-Distribution&amp;utm_campaign=SR-FB-P"><i>Screen Rant</i></a> in a recent interview that The Thing would be a fun role, or perhaps even Kingpin.</p>

        <b>Black said: </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>No. No one’s coming to mind. Oh, it’d be fun to play like an evil dude, like the Kingpin. Yeah. I don’t know. Maybe The Thing? It’d be rad to be that rock dude from the Fantastic Four.</blockquote>
      <p>The Thing isn’t a stranger to the big screen. In <i>Fantastic Four </i>and <i>Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer</i>, Michael Chiklis played the larger-than-life hero. It wasn’t until 10 years later when Jamie Bell took on the role in a rebooted <i>Fantastic Four</i> – which was critically slaughtered.</p>
      <p>Kingpin (aka Wilson Fisk), on the other hand, is most revered for his TV appearances. Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile) played the villain in the maligned 2003 flick <i>Daredevil</i>, but when a series based on the same hero hit Netflix that people really fell in love with the character.</p>

      <p>That’s solely down to Vincent D’Onofrio and his absolutely chilling portrayal. Would Jack Black suit the role? Obviously, there’s no way of knowing until it actually happened – but fans would likely rather D’Onofrio got the big screen treatment instead.</p>
      <p>As for The Thing, Black would be a brilliant candidate – throughout his career, the actor has brought a roster of hilarious films to life with his infectious energy. Balancing that comedic talent with his serious chops could give way to the best Thing yet.</p>

      <p>Following Disney’s purchase of Fox, the Fantastic Four are in development for entering the MCU, however we just don’t when or who will play the characters.</p>
      <p>Get John Krasinski and Emily Blunt aboard as Reed Richards and Sue Storm, and you’ve got yourself a cracking start.</p>
