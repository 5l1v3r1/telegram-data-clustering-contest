      <h1>Wirral Council’s street light shame as years of inaction anger locals</h1>
      <h2>In Wallasey, hundreds of lights are out and locals say many of these have not been fixed for years</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:57:20+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/george-morgan/" target="_blank">George Morgan</a></address>
      <p>People are scared, angry and confused about <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wirral">Wirral’s</a> ongoing street light nightmare.</p>
      <p>Despite vows to solve the problem from senior councillors over many years, locals feel more unsafe than ever as the nights draw in.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wallasey">Wallasey</a> , hundreds of lights are out and with people saying many of these have not been fixed for years.</p>
      <p>Speaking about an alleyway in Seaview Road, Jan Stockham said: “I won’t go out in the dark as my property is over half way down and it’s pitch back, I feel there is a very high risk of assault so I avoid it in the dark.</p>

      <p>“Five neighbours have rang the council over this light, as it's the only one in the entry.</p>
      <p>“There are eight flats along the entry and we have to walk down in the dark with risk every day. The dentist at 3 Hose Side Road has installed sensor lights so they can see but they shouldn't have to!”</p>
      <p>Rita Krummins is deeply upset about the broken lights on her street, Elleray Park Road, in Wallasey.</p>
      <p>She said: “You can see the old style street light on the residential side which is not working and the last one looking up the street.</p>

      <p>“So there are two lights on either side of the road at the top and the bottom and nothing in the middle.</p>
      <p>“We had drug dealing in the park a while ago and personally I would like to see street lights along the path in the park too.”</p>
      <p>As winter arrives, these issues are only going to have more of an impact on people in the borough.</p>
      <p>Helen Clinch, of Silverlea Avenue, Wallasey, said: “Unfortunately I leave home for work in the dark and return in the dark.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/wirral-mans-6000-complaints-broken-17225469">the ECHO reported the story of one man who went to extraordinary lengths to record the extent of the problem</a> .</p>
      <p>Over almost four years, he recorded the details of hundreds of broken street lights, taking photos of each one and annotating them meticulously.</p>
      <p>The darkness they create can have serious consequences.</p>

      <p>Last week, a coroner was told broken street lights <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/young-dad-killed-driver-who-17265086">played a significant role in the death of a young dad</a> hit by a car in Birkenhead.</p>
      <p>An inquest into the death of Wallasey man John Barker, 30, heard three out of four street lights covering the junction of Oxton Road and Exmouth Street, Birkenhead , were out when he was fatally injured on February 20 last year.</p>
      <p>Daniel Davies, whose Rockpoint Leisure enterprise is <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/how-new-brighton-being-transformed-17035088">investing huge sums of money</a> to regenerate New Brighton, told the BBC broken street lights could harm his plans.</p>
      <p>He said providing lighting was one of the most basic things a council can do.</p>

      <p>He also tweeted: “Light makes people feel safer, they are less likely to trip over and anti-social behaviour decreases.”</p>
      <p>The issue exists across Wirral and is by no means just a Wallasey problem.</p>
      <p>Commenting on Facebook, EJ Grainger said a number of street lights were broken where she lived in West Kirby.</p>
      <p>The ECHO had reports of broken street lights from every corner of the borough, but the problem appears to be most concentrated in East Wirral, around Wallasey and Birkenhead.</p>
      <p>It is a long-running saga.</p>
      <h3>Wirral Council’s many pledges</h3>
      <p>The issue of broken street lights moved up the political agenda in February 2015, after a Liberal Democrat councillor branded <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wirral-council">Wirral Council</a> a ‘disgrace’ for their slow response on the issue.</p>
      <p>The cabinet member responsible at the time, Labour councillor Stuart Whittingham, said: “We are currently investing in replacing our most inefficient and expensive street lights with new LED units.”</p>
      <p>Exactly a year later, Cllr Whittingham apologised for not dealing with the problem sooner and said the council will deal with it.</p>

      <p>Later that year, Wirral Council announced it had used a special type of interest free loan (called Salix) to address the issue.</p>
      <p>With the loan it replaced 7,000 of the borough’s worst energy performing lights with modern LED lamps.</p>
      <p>Then, in October 2017, an article appeared on the council’s Wirral View website, stating a further 600 street lights were to be replaced with new LED lamps as part of an ongoing programme to modernise the borough’s street lights.</p>
      <p>280 lighting columns would also be replaced as part of the work.</p>

      <p>Again, the council admitted it had issues with how it manages the volume of reports about faulty street lights and the backlog of repairs.</p>
      <p>Another year, another promise. In January 2018, Wirral Council said work to replace all 27,000 of its street lights will begin within weeks.</p>
      <p>Cllr Whittingham proclaimed: “It is a huge commitment and one which I know residents will welcome.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>That commitment was bolstered a few months later in April, when the council’s then leader Phil Davies, said: “I will also be proposing to cabinet that we deploy £6m from our capital funds to take the opportunity to replace broken and damaged lamp-post columns at the same time.</p>
      <p>“[I will also] make a further £750,000 available to repair bollards, damaged signs and other safety features.”</p>
      <p>But that did not seem to do the trick either.</p>
      <p>In a response to an ECHO article on this issue earlier in the month, Wirral Council said their two-year LED streetlight upgrade programme is currently in its second phase - <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/council-accused-leaving-borough-darkness-16872791">aiming to replace 28,000 streetlights</a> with LED bulbs by autumn 2021.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson for the council, added: “We have [now] successfully bid for over £10 million of funding, which allowed us to start replacing 9,200 full streetlight columns in September.”</p>
      <p>The spokesperson said that means more than 60 street lights are being repaired each day in Wirral.</p>
      <p>Time will only tell if this latest pledge can ease the anguish of worried, frustrated locals, who have waited a long time for their concerns to be addressed.</p>
