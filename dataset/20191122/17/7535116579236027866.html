      <p>Malaysia has always been known to be the land of rempits, snatch thieves and animal abusers. But there’s a new criminal trend that’s taking over our country. Scammers.</p>
      <p>But you know what’s worse than scammers? Racist scammers.</p>
      <p>Netizen <a href="https://twitter.com/SathishSarma">Sathish Sarma (@SathishSarma)</a> took to his Twitter page to <a href="https://twitter.com/SathishSarma/status/1197045315766874112">showcase</a> how he had received a call from a scammer, only to be rejected from being scammed because the scammer found out that he was Indian. <i>Wait, what?</i></p>

      <p>Sathish wrote, “Just received a scam call to my house phone.</p>
      <p>Me: Who are you? What do you mean by I have a court notice?</p>
      <p>Scammer: You’re Indian? Sorry, we don’t cheat Indians. We only scam Malays and Chinese.</p>
      <p>What the heck? Scammers also can be racist ah?”</p>

      <p>Though he took the incident with quite a sense of humour, adding in his thread, “Avoiding Scammers in Malaysia 101, Lesson 1: Introduce yourself as Indian and the scammers will go ‘Sorry, wrong number’.”</p>
      <p>He also added one very important piece of advice when it comes to dealing with scammers. Just ignore them, unless you wanna try trolling them by pretending to be Indian, as most of these scammers don’t actually have much information on you besides what you provide them with over the conversation.</p>
      <p>Sathish’s posting has since garnered over 15,500 retweets.</p>

        <i>As an Indian myself, I see this as a victory. Now, I’ll probably never get scammed. </i>
