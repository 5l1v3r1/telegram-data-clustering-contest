      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:42:24+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:42</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Reade, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/brian-reade/</a></address>
      <p>IF you’re anything like me, your first reaction on hearing the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrew-forced-fire-loyal-20933491">Grand Old Joke Of York</a> was finished doing royal work was “when did he start?”</p>
      <p>Whereas some of us take a gap year, this freeloading lump of self-entitlement seems to have been on a gap life since leaving the Navy – circumnavigating the globe in first class with his golf clubs in the hold, demanding to be treated like a ­medieval monarch wherever he lands.</p>
      <p>When news broke, in 2015, that he’d been named in an American civil case against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> as having sex on three occasions with 17-year-old <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/virginia-roberts">Virginia Roberts</a> (which he denies), his Dukeship was holidaying in an ­exclusive, fully staffed, Verbier ski chalet, which he’d bought for £13million.</p>
      <p>Yet few of those outraged at his haughty arrogance during that hara-kiri BBC interview, ask themselves how a man on a £20,000 Naval pension, and £259,000-a-year grant from his mum in return for putting his name on charity letterheads, could afford a £13million ski chalet, not to mention a £200,000 Bentley, a Windsor mansion, the non-stop foreign golf trips and private yacht holidays.</p>
      <p>Mind you, few of us asked how the most ­work-shy resident of Royal Benefits Street, Princess Margaret, was worth £20million when she died, so why start now?</p>
      <p>And when his Royal Dukeness was in that chalet with his family in 2015, there were five protection officers around him, paid for by the British taxpayer, and he flew home by <br/>private jet. Mind you, this was the man who demanded round-the-clock protection for his daughters, so no change there.</p>
      <p>I’m permanently ­bewildered that our nation keeps funding this embarrassing feudal anachronism called the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/royal-family">Royal Family</a> , allowing them to keep vast estates we could put to better use when so many of our ­citizens don’t have homes. Especially when as much as 47% of the UK’s land is owned by hereditary aristocratic families.</p>
      <p>If I were an MP, I’d like to debate that in the Commons, but I wouldn’t be able to as Parliament is barred from ­scrutinising the Royal Family’s affairs.</p>
      <p>Although I’d struggle to sit in the Commons, due to the 1868 Promissory Oaths Act which requires all who do to swear they’ll bear “true allegiance to the monarch and all her heirs and successors”. How could you bear anything but ill will to someone like Andrew, who’s still in with a shout of succeeding her?</p>
      <p>The Times wrote in an editorial on the latest royal scandal this week: “If monarchies did not exist today few would invent them.”</p>
      <p>Which brings me to the most insulting aspect of that car-crash TV interview. Not Andrew’s lack of empathy for Epstein’s victims, his reference to the human begging bowl he divorced 23 years ago as “The Duchess” or his genuine belief he could take us all for mugs by talking down to us for an hour.</p>
      <p>It was the knowledge that, once again, a nation currently venting outrage at a senior royal for taking the regal pee out of us for decades, will soon forget it.</p>
      <p>Come the next Buckingham Palace balcony shot, cute royal baby snap or photos of Andrew’s Princess daughter’s fairy-tale wedding, their cheerleaders will swoon and say we’d be lost without our precious monarchy.</p>
      <p>And like nodding plastic poodles, the majority of us will agree and ask Gawd to bless ’em.</p>
