      <h1>China's new envoy to Canada delivers familiar message on justice, rights</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:39:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:39</time> by <a rel="author">The Canadian Press, Staff</a></address>
      <p>OTTAWA - Beijing has a new representative in Canada, but the stern message to Ottawa remains the same.</p>
      <p>Chinese ambassador Cong Peiwu is reiterating his country's call for Canada to release Meng Wanzhou, an executive with Huawei Technologies arrested nearly a year ago.</p>
      <p>Relations between Ottawa and Beijing have been fractious since early last December, when Canadian authorities in Vancouver took Meng into custody following a request from the United States over allegations of violating sanctions on Iran.</p>
      <p>Cong said in a roundtable interview in Ottawa today that Meng's arrest and pending extradition to the U.S. amount to arbitrary detention.</p>
      <p>Soon after Meng was arrested, Beijing detained two Canadians, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, on allegations of undermining national security.</p>
      <p>The developments are widely seen in Canada as retaliation for the detention of Meng, whose extradition hearing begins in January.</p>
