      <h3>Samsung Odyssey Mixed Reality Headset is on sale</h3>
      <p>Microsoft’s official eBay store offers the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/21/samsung-hmd-odyssey-headset-deal/">Samsung Hmd Odyssey+ Windows Mixed Reality Headset Bundle for <b>$249</b></a>. Typically selling for $499, today’s offer is good for a 50% discount, is $30 under our previous mention, and a new all-time low. This matched the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/01/microsoft-black-friday-sneak-peek/">expected Black Friday pricing</a>. Samsung’s Hmd Odyssey+ headset comes bundled with two motion-activated controllers. It immerses you in mixed reality experiences by pairing with a PC. Notable specs include built-in AKG headphones with 360-degree spatial sound and a high-resolution AMOLED display. Plus, it improves on the previous generation version with Anti-Screen Door Effect technology and 1,233 PPI displays. </p>
      <h3>Get 512GB of speedy SanDisk microSD storage</h3>
      <p>Amazon currently offers the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/22/sandisk-512gb-extreme-microsdxc-card/">SanDisk 512GB Extreme microSDXC Card for <b>$110</b></a>. Having dropped from $150, today’s offer is good for an over 26% discount, matches the Amazon all-time low, and is only the second time we’ve seen it under $130. For comparison, you’ll still pay the full price of $200 at Best Buy. SanDisk’s microSD card is a notable buy whether you’re in search of some extra storage for a drone, Android smartphone or tablet, action camera, or even a Nintendo Switch. It offers upwards of 160MB/s read and write speeds, meaning you’ll be able to enjoy speedy transfers when it comes to moving photos and other content over to your computer. You’re also looking at a lifetime warranty.</p>
      <h3>Black Friday pricing arrives for Amazon’s Kindle E-readers</h3>
      <p>Amazon’s Black Friday pricing on its <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/22/amazon-kindle-black-friday-sale/">Kindle E-readers is now live</a> with free shipping for all. The latest <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/22/amazon-kindle-black-friday-sale/">entry-level Kindle drops to <b>$60</b></a>. You’d typically pay $90 for the E-reader alone. Today’s deal is a new Amazon all-time low as well. The latest Kindle features a 167ppi glare-free display, which is designed to read like real paper instead of a traditional electronic display.
