      <p>167hp, 221Nm monster to be unveiled as part of Triumph India's sixth anniversary celebrations.</p>
      <p>Triumph will showcase the 2020 Rocket 3 in India on December 5, 2019. The new Rocket 3 was unveiled globally a few months ago and this is the first time that the motorcycle will be showcased in India. The showcase also coincides with Triumph's sixth anniversary in India and the motorcycle will be unveiled at a special event in Goa – just a day before the Indian Bike Week kicks-off on December 6, 2019.</p>
      <p>The new Triumph Rocket 3 is based on a brand-new platform and is available in international markets in two variants – Rocket 3 R and Rocket 3 GT. The latter is the more touring-focused motorcycle. As of now, it's unclear if Triumph will showcase one or both variants.</p>
      <p>The Rocket 3's biggest highlight, literally, is the new 2,500cc, liquid-cooled engine: Triumph says is the largest engine fitted to a mass-produced motorcycle. The motor produces 167hp at 6,000rpm and a stomach churning 221Nm at 4,000rpm.</p>
      <p>The new engine is also significantly lighter (by 18kg) thanks to a new crank case assembly, lubrication system and balancer shaft. In fact, the new Rocket 3 is over 40kg lighter overall than its predecessor.</p>
      <p>As expected, the Rocket 3 is loaded with top-spec electronics to keep everything in check.</p>
      <p>The new Rocket 3 bikes have a new, all-aluminium frame with the engine as a stressed member. Suspension duties are taken care of by 47mm, compression and rebound adjustable, Showa USD forks (with 120mm travel) at the front and a monoshock at the rear with a Showa piggyback reservoir and remote adjuster (with 107mm travel).</p>
      <p>The brakes are another highlight – twin 320mm discs at the front with superbike-spec Brembo Stylema four-piston monobloc calipers (the same ones seen on the Ducati Panigale V4) and a 300mm disc at the rear with Brembo M4.32, four-piston calipers.</p>
      <p>The new Triumph Rocket 3 is expected to go on sale in India soon after it is unveiled. Stay tuned for more.</p>
