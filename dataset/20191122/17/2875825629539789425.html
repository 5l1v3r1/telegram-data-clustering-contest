      <h1>Slaven Bilic explains how banning UB40 helped him get win over Liverpool</h1>
      <h2>The West Brom boss has clear guidelines on what pre-match music is allowed in his dressing rooms, and discussed life with the Baggies with Mirror Football's Mike Walters</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>When <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/slaven-bilic">Slaven Bilic</a> walked in the dressing room and found his players swaying to UB40's Red Red Wine on the ghetto blaster, they were getting away with Merlot.</p>
      <p>Although he has never interfered again with the musical soundtrack before a big game, Bilic drew the line at getting reggae to rumble.</p>
      <p>He hijacked the sound system, replaced the lilt about red wine with a raunchier number about whisky – and his drop of the hard stuff worked a treat.</p>
      <p>“It was Roy Keane who said you can't play Abba before a game, and I agree with that,” said the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Brom</a> manager, enjoying his view from the Championship summit.</p>
      <p>“When I went to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> in my first season as the manager, it was 50 years since we had beaten them at Anfield.</p>

      <p>“Before the game, we are all in the small away dressing room before the players go out and they have got Red Red Wine from UB40 playing in there.</p>
      <p>“I'm like, 'Red Red Wine? That's for a romantic dinner, it's not a war song!' So I said 'Sorry, lads' and I put on Whisky In The Jar – the Metallica version – and we won 3-0. After that, I didn't interrupt.</p>
      <p>“You have got to be in the zone, allow music to lift you up. When they are promoting Liverpool v Man City on Sky or whatever, it's always power guitars and pumped up. It's never Beethoven.”</p>

      <p>If Bilic was scarred by his love affair with West Ham ending abruptly, two years ago almost to the day, he has rebounded in style – with matching bionic hip replacements.</p>
      <p>The Baggies have rediscovered their boing-boing, and he said: “When I came here, it was like I didn't need to wake them up. They are good players, they are motivated.</p>
      <p>“It's a big club but a newish team. We lost 11 players, including Dwight Gayle and Jay Rodriguez – that is 46 goals from last season – but we were lucky enough to be good at transfers and they have clicked straight away.</p>
      <p>“The guys who were here were not big-time Charlies, noses in the air, but when a new manager brings in fresh ideas during the first week of pre-season, they all believe in it – but deep in their minds they need proof that it will work... and there is no better proof than results.”</p>

      <p>It's 12 years since Bilic sent English football into a painful round of introspection after Croatia's 3-2 win at Wembley cost Steve McClaren the Three Lions job and 'Wally with the brolly' became a part of our lexicon.</p>
      <p>So why is a manager of international repute, now 51, scuffling below stairs in England?</p>
      <p>“I'm not saying the Championship is a dream for every manager, but it is very tempting,”said Bilic. “If you go to Europe, everyone knows about this division.</p>
      <p>“And I'm not saying the Championship is better, but it is unique. First, you have 46 games minimum – unbelievable. And second is the amount of big clubs: not clubs who were big 50 years ago, but maybe 10 years ago.</p>

      <p>“Right now in Germany, you have Hamburg and Stuttgart in Bundesliga 2, two massive clubs that have dropped. I told one of my friends from Germany, 'Can you imagine a league with 10 clubs like that?'</p>
      <p>“That was one of my motives to come here. I'm also a realistic guy – I knew what sort of clubs would want me and this looked like a good opportunity from both sides.”</p>
      <p>It was also Bilic's first choice – after he compiled a shopping list of potential clubs at 35,000ft.</p>
      <p>His intuition served him well.</p>

        <figcaption>Bilic is still as passionate as ever<cite>(Image: PA)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“It was in April last season, when I was flying from Split to Manchester (as a TV pundit at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> v West Ham) and I had time on the plane to compile a list of places where I would like to work.</p>
      <p>“First I put England, Germany, Turkey – those countries where I have a name and it would be easier for me to get a job.</p>
      <p>“Under England, OK – I didn't put <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> on the list, and I didn't put West Ham! But there were three English teams, and the first one was West Brom.</p>
      <p>“After signing the contract here, when I came home and I was clearing out my backpack, I found that piece of paper.</p>
      <p>“I like it here. Birmingham is half the size of Croatia's entire population, but I've lived in London, Moscow, Istanbul, Jeddah, all massive cities, this is the first time that everywhere is just 15 minutes away.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people told me, 'Birmingham is this, Birmingham is that, it is not nice' – but I have been shocked in a positive way. I couldn't find an apartment in the city centre that was big enough for my family (wife and five children), but we found a place in Sutton Coldfield. It is top, top, top.</p>
      <p>“And the Brummie accent is no problem. Don't forget, I played for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> and lived on Merseyside. And when Walter Smith was the manager, there were eight to 10 Scots in the dressing room, so this place is a piece of cake.”</p>

        <figcaption>He still keeps an eye out for his old club West Ham's results<cite>(Image: Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Whisper it gently, or shout it from the rooftops if you must, but West Brom and freefalling West Ham could yet be trading places next season.</p>
      <p>Yet beneath his ample greying beard, there is no lingering bitterness.</p>
      <p>“Of course I still look out for West Ham's results. I played there, I managed there. They started well, but now it's not so good.</p>
      <p>“The players are good, but it's a very difficult club to manage. You always have that thing about London. For teams like West Ham and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> , you have a feeling they are only performing when they are struggling and they have to win.”</p>
      <p>And the million-dollar question remains unsolved: If he goes back to the London Stadium as a visiting manager and he is offered a drop of red wine for a post-match drink, will Bilic ask for something stronger – like a nip of whisky?</p>
