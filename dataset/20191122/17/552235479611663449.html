      <h1>West Dunbartonshire social workers extend threat of industrial action</h1>
      <h2>Unison have confirmed action has been suspended for another six months following concerns over a “lack of progress”.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:03:30+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:03</time> by <a rel="author">Jenny Foulds, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jenny-foulds/</a></address>
      <p>Social workers have extended their threat of industrial action for a further six months following concerns over a “lack of progress”.</p>
      <p>Fed-up staff in the children and families were on the brink of striking earlier this year and filed a collective grievance over “excessive workloads, inappropriate working environments and health and safety issues”.</p>
      <p>In May, action was suspended until November 27 following talks with council bosses, who pledged to take action to resolve the dispute.</p>
      <p>But last week, Unison revealed the possibility of strikes has now been extended until May next year.</p>
      <p>Last week, members unanimously agreed to make the extension, saying it is needed to ensure improvements are made.</p>
      <p>Addressing a West Dunbartonshire Health and Social Care Partnership (WDHSCP) board meeting on Wednesday last week, Peter O’Neill, of Unison, said staff were “frustrated” over a lack of progress.</p>
      <p>He said: “The threat of industrial action expires on November 27. There was a meeting yesterday and they have unanimously decided to extend the mandate for a further six months.</p>
      <p>“The feeling was that members are so frustrated by the lack of progress and any progress made is because of the threat of industrial action.</p>
      <p>“There has been an extension of the order to ensure progress.”</p>
      <p>Social staff filed the collective grievance after saying they couldn’t cope with the demand on the service following the closure of the Alexandria office last year,</p>
      <p>Council bosses later struck a deal with staff to move them to a temporary office in Bridge Street in Dumbarton and recruit the equivalent of 12 and a half extra workers but Val says they are still waiting to find out what the arrangement will be on a permanent basis.</p>
      <p>Last week, the WDHSCP meeting heard that work is going on behind the scenes to resolve the issues.</p>
      <p>Progress has been made with the recruitment of additional staff members in order to clear the backlog of cases, with the council continuing to advertise for social workers through their social media channels.</p>
      <p>Allan Macleod, chair, said there needed to be “an element of reality” over the time it will take to work through the actions promised.</p>
      <p>He said: “The reality is that the individual elements are difficult to resolve very quickly in terms of recruitment, for example.</p>
      <p>“It’s not for want of trying and we will continue to enseavour to recruit more staff,</p>
      <p>“There’s an element of reality that needs to be there between staff and management.”</p>
      <p>HSCP chief officer Beth Culshaw said: “While progress has not been as quick as people like, there is considerable effort going into this.</p>
      <p>“It’s fair to say we have progressed.”</p>
      <p>Speaking afterwards, Val Jennings, of West Dunbartonshire’s Unison branch, said: “Unison members within the children and families section of WDHSCP remain dismayed and dissatisfied at the slow progress made to fully address what they feel are alarming issues.</p>
      <p>“Unison members believe that the progress that has been made has be achieved due to the overwhelming mandate we have to take industrial action if necessary.</p>
      <p>“Unison members now wish to renew that mandate to maintain the pressure to see matters progress to a full resolution.</p>
      <p>“Unison will continue to campaign, taking required action if necessary, on behalf of the community, service users and staff for quality and sufficient resources that meet the demands of West Dunbartonshire.”</p>
