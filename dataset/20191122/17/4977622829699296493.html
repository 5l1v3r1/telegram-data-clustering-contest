      <h1>BJP Activist Files Plea In SC Against ‘Unholy’ Post-Poll Alliance Of Shiv Sena, NCP And Congress</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:15:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author">IANS</a></address>
      <p>A BJP activist from Maharashtra has filed a plea in the Supreme Court against the post poll alliance of the NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress in the state calling it an "unholy" one, even as the three parties were in a final huddle on Friday to cobble together the numbers.</p>
      <p>Surendra Bahadur Singh in his plea contended that voters had given a clear mandate to the BJP-Sena alliance. "The present petition seeks to stop the unholy alliance between three political parties which have all fought against each other but is trying to form a government by joining hands thereby defeating the electoral mandate," said the plea.</p>
      <p>The petitioner seeks the apex court orders to restrain the Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari from inviting the NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress to form a government in against mandate.</p>
      <p>As an alternative, if a government is formed against the mandate of the people, it can be declared as unconstitutional, void ab initio and therefore liable to be dismissed.</p>
      <p>Singh contended that Shiv Sena and Bhatiya Janata Party contested the polls against the political parties National Congress Party and the Congress.</p>
      <p>"If a coalition of Shiv Sena with the political parties against which it contested the election is allowed to form a Government, the same will result in dilution of the mandate of the public and is against constitutional ethos," said the plea.</p>
      <p>Singh said that there is a larger question before the court: "Whether the expression includes a group of parties that contested against each other and fought election expressly against each other in terms of ideology, policies, propaganda and manifesto?"</p>
