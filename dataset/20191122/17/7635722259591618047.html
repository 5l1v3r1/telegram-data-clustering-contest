        <b>Some 11,000 buildings in Dublin city centre briefly lost power on Friday afternoon.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A fault on a power line at Heuston Station affected people on both sides of the River Liffey.</p>
      <p>These were mostly in the Stoneybatter and Kilmainham areas of the city.</p>
      <p>Other areas such as St Stephen's Green and Rialto were also affected.</p>
      <p>ESB crews put a temporary fix in place within five minutes.</p>
      <p>They are now working to find a permanent solution.</p>
      <p>The ESB has apologised for the loss of supply.</p>
      <p>While Irish Rail services appear to be unaffected.</p>
