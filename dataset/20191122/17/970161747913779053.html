      <p>Divina DiCampo has revealed how <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michelle-visage/">Michelle Visage</a> almost made her quit RuPaul’s Drag Race after the judges tore her make-up and outfit to shreds.</p>
      <p>The runner-up explained the reason why she was crying so much in week two – and that TV bosses didn’t show the real reason of why she was visibly upset.</p>
      <p>She also told how the audience didn’t see parts of the show and revealed how it made her look like a ‘crazy person’ – which made her question her position in the competition.</p>
      <p>‘Week two where I’m crying,’ she began.</p>
      <p>‘I nearly left that week, I nearly went home. I just thought I don’t need to put myself through this, I already have a good career, I already have a really good fanbase.</p>
      <p>‘What you didn’t get to see was when Michelle [Visage] said to Scaredy Kat, “Are we always going to see this make-up on you?” she then said, “Because you have these incredible make-up artists around you, why don’t you ask Blu [Hydrangea] or Cheryl [Hole] or Crystal for some advice?”</p>

      <p>The final three were put through their paces in the last mega challenge, which saw them learn dance routines from Strictly’s AJ Pritchard and Love Island brother Curtis Pritchard, as well as appear on RuPaul and Michelle Visage’s podcast, What’s The Tee?</p>

      <p>Finally they had to come up with their own lyrics to RuPaul’s Rock It [To The Moon].</p>

      <p>‘The Vivienne has it all, she can serve a look, deliver a line, she is without doubt a terrific drag queen, drag act,’ Graham Norton said in the final deliberations.</p>
      <p>Alan Carr agreed and said: She’s got that trademark wit. When she was Trump, oh my God, it was the best Trump I’ve ever seen. It was a comedy masterclass.’</p>
      <p>Then RuPaul herself declared: ‘The Viv is a perfect example of a 21<sup>st</sup> century British Queen. I think she is a great representative of what this competition can turn out.’</p>
