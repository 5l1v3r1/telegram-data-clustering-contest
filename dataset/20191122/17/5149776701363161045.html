      <p>A Nottinghamshire Post Office has been put up for sale - and a new retailer is wanted to take it on.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/stapleford">Stapleford</a> Post Office's current Post Master is resigning from the position and the branch will continue to trade until April.</p>
      <p>If a replacement permanent Post Master is not found before April, the Post Office will look at other ways to try to maintain services in the area.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/stapleford">Derby Road</a> site takes an estimated £20,500 to £25,600 in fees per year.</p>
      <p>Retailers running a Post Office do not have to pay franchise fees and equipment is paid and staff will be trained.</p>
      <p>A Post Office spokesperson said: "We would like to reassure customers that we are committed to providing a Post Office in Stapleford.</p>
      <p>"We have recently received a resignation from the operator for Stapleford Post Office. The branch will continue to trade until April.</p>
      <p>“We understand how important a Post Office is to a community.                    </p>
      <p>“Any retailer or small <a href="https://www.business-live.co.uk/all-about/east-midlands">business</a> owner interested in running the Post Office and incorporating it into their business should visit www.runapostoffice.co.uk email ND.enquiries@postoffice.co.uk or phone 0333 345 5560, then select option 2. The vacancy is on our Run A Post Office website.”</p>
