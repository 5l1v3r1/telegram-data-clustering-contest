      <p>A Bristol musician has been nominated for four gongs at one of the music industry's most prestigious award ceremonies.</p>
      <p>The Grammys was launched 60 years ago and honours the very best in music across the world, recognising the artists who have had standout years.</p>
      <p>Nominees for the 2020 Grammys were revealed on Wednesday (November 20) and include the likes of Lizzo, Billy Eilish, The 1975 and Ariana Grande.</p>
      <p>Also among the potential winners at the coveted award ceremony is Bristol-born singer Yola - who is in the running to walk away with a staggering four awards.</p>

      <p>Aged 35, Yola (real name Yola Carter) has had an on-off career in music for over a decade.</p>
      <p>Even if you’ve never heard the name, you may well have heard the voice, as Yola’s powerhouse vocals - and songwriting talent - have featured on tracks from the likes of Iggy Azalea, Massive Attack, Katy Perry, Will Young and the Chemical Brothers, among others.</p>
      <p>After years in London Yola moved back to Bristol following an eviction, which left her temporarily living on the streets of the capital.</p>
      <p>Incredibly, it was a house fire in 2015 that put her solo career back on track, she told <i>Bristol Live's</i> Matthew Jenkins.</p>
      <p>It led her to pick up the guitar again and her debut album, <i>Walk Through Fire</i>, was then recorded in Nashville with acclaimed producer Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys.</p>
      <p>The LP, which features break-up songs and sun-soaked tales of new opportunities which already sound like they’ve been around for years, was released in February and widely praised.</p>
      <h3>What has she been nominated for?</h3>
