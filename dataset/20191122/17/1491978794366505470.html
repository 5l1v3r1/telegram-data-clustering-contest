      <p>Not all of us are in Kafr Aqab because we are star-crossed lovers, but it is true that we live here because we are forced to (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/nov/10/kafr-aqab-jerusalem-love-neighbourhood-palestinians">Love island: The walled enclave where residents of West Bank and Jerusalem can live together</a>, 11 November). To understand what’s happening in Kafr Aqab, you need to understand what’s happening to Palestinians living in East Jerusalem under Israeli military law.</p>
      <p>In a nutshell, it’s not easy. <a href="https://www.btselem.org/topic/jerusalem">According to B’tselem</a>, “Immediately after occupying the area in 1967, Israel unlawfully annexed thousands of hectares in and around Jerusalem. Ever since, it has instituted policies designed to drive Palestinians out of the city and to create a demographic and geographic reality that would frustrate any challenge to Israeli sovereignty there. The policies, which disrupt every aspect of life, include isolating East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank and deliberate underdevelopment and underservicing that result in overcrowding, poverty and substandard infrastructure.”</p>
      <p>The “centre of life” policy is just one of those making life impossible for Palestinian Jerusalemites. It only applies to Palestinians with Jerusalem IDs (not Israelis in Jerusalem) and forces them to only exist within the borders of the municipality – that’s how Kafr Aqab came to the “rescue”. Kafr Aqab is within the Jerusalem municipality’s borders; hence those living there can maintain their “centre of life” in Jerusalem. But the apartheid wall cuts it off from East Jerusalem, turning it into a lawless limbo with no services provided, no clear legal jurisdiction or proper planning authority, a horrible sewage system, unmaintainable phone lines.</p>
      <p>There is no room for love between spending two hours at a checkpoint, having no running water, and endless frustrations while losing the ability to live in your original place of residence without hassle from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>.<br/><b>Waed M Abbas</b><br/><i>Jerusalem</i></p>
