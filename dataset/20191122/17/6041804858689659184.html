      <p>Here comes the ‘mass’ that Superstar <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/movienews/mahesh-babu-inspires-naga-chaitanya-samantha-akkineni/">Mahesh Babu </a>fans have been waiting for a long time. The teaser of Sarileru Neekevvaru is out, and it shows a glimpse of Mass-MB as the makers are rightly promoting.</p>
      <p>All the various details and promotional pictures from sets that have come so far are put to the right use. We are still almost fifty days away from the release, but the video is practically a full-blown trailer. The central characters and core plot are revealed.</p>
      <p>In a way, revealing everything has been the strategy of director Anil Ravipudi. He gives away the story in the trailer or the first fifteen minutes of the movie. It is the fact that he manages to engage even after showing all the cards is what makes him so successful right. The dialogues as seen here are proof of that. They are an instant winner for the fans and time perfectly with the Sankranthi festival. Given that the movie also comes in competition, it works in other ways, as well.</p>
      <p>Also, while the ‘mass’ is showcased in the teaser, nothing from the entertainment is made part of it. There is a lot of comedy, and makers too have highlighted it several times. That will be reserved for the time when the final trailer arrives. Then there is music by Devi Sri Prasad. So, a lot is coming up for the fans in the coming days.</p>
      <p>Check out the trailer below. Rashmika Mandanna is the heroine opposite Mahesh Babu. The commercial entertainer is all set to hit the screens worldwide in a record number of theatres on January 11th, 2020.</p>
