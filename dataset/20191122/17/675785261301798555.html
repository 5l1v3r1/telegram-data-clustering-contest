      <h2>Natalie Wood's accomplices planned to sell a 'kiss and tell' story to the press but the athlete leaped out of the window and the court heard she had been manipulated, Bristol Crown Court heard</h2>

      <p>A woman who was filmed in bed with a cheating Premier League footballer has been sentenced for attempting to blackmail him.</p>
      <p>Natalie Wood, 28, had previously met the high-profile player on two occasions after he contacted her on social media.</p>
      <p>Bristol Crown Court heard he blocked Wood from messaging him when she asked if he was in a relationship.</p>
      <p>The sportsman, who has lifelong anonymity, later unblocked her and requested that she send him sexual videos, before arranging to meet her in a hotel.</p>
      <p>A plan was hatched for two men to burst in and film that liaison, then sell the footage as a kiss and tell story.</p>
      <p>Footage shows the footballer, clad only in his underwear, jumping out of the hotel room window after the men enter.</p>

      <p>He later received a message from Wood threatening to expose him to the media if he did not respond within 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Judge Martin Picton jailed Wood for 14 months but suspended the sentence for 12 months due to "exceptional" circumstances.</p>
      <p>"Blackmail is always a very wicked crime and has the power to do great harm to others but I have no doubt that whatever your thoughts about it, you were subjected to significant manipulation," he told Wood.</p>

      <p>"Those that were manipulating you did not have an intention to extract money directly from the intended victim.</p>
      <p>"Having listened to some of the voicemail messages and some of the text messages, their attitude towards you is plain.</p>
      <p>"You have been deeply foolish and allowed the attraction of celebrity to put you in the position where you have made some horrible mistakes in your life.</p>
      <p>"I make it clear that I am dealing with you in respect of the text message that was sent albeit you misunderstood the motives behind it."</p>
      <p>Wood previously admitted conspiring to blackmail the footballer with three men, who were later cleared of the charge after a three-week trial in October.</p>

      <p>Her plea to that charge was dropped following the jury's verdict and on Friday she admitted a charge of attempting to blackmail the star.</p>
      <p>Jurors were told Wood, former Take Me Out contestant Tyrone Coleman, his brother Nathan and Prince Rowe, planned to film the player in bed with her.</p>
      <p>The Coleman brothers and Rowe insisted the footage was to be sold to the press.</p>
      <p>Judge Picton said Wood mistakenly believed the plan was to extract money directly from the footballer and sent him the text message with that in mind.</p>
      <p>The message read: "I don't really want to expose you to the media but if you don't respond within 24 hours then you leave me no choice."</p>

      <p>Prosecuting, Simon Jones said Wood volunteered to co-operate with police following her initial guilty plea and gave evidence during the trial.</p>
      <p>The court heard Wood has since written a letter of apology to the footballer.</p>
      <p>Peter Asteris, representing Wood, said: "Miss Wood has been something of a victim herself. She has been manipulated."</p>
      <p>He said his client had been stalked online, with abusive messages sent to her and her family.</p>
      <p>The judge remarked: "The celebrity that attracted her to others has consequences."</p>
      <p>Prince Rowe, 38, was jailed for 16 months for stealing the footballer's Rolex watch and designer tracksuit after he fled the hotel room.</p>
      <p>He was one of two men who burst into the hotel room, using a room key that had been provided by Wood, to film the player.</p>
      <p>Rowe, of Birmingham, was wearing the tracksuit when he was arrested while waiting to board a flight to Dubai.</p>
      <p>The judge told him: "You took the opportunity of bursting into the hotel room to get footage you wanted to sell to get your hands on his watch."</p>
      <p>The watch, worth Â£23,000, and the designer tracksuit were returned to the footballer after Rowe's arrest.</p>
