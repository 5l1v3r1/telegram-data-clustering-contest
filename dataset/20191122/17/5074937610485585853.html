      <p>Nyinahin (Ash), Nov. 22, GNA - Vice-President, Alhaji Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, has cut the sod for work to commence on the Sinohydro road projects within the areas of Nyinahin in the Ashanti and Sefwi-Wiawso, in the Western Regions.</p>
      <p>In all, about 69.51 kilometres of roads are to be constructed in those areas under the ‘Sinohydro Master Project Support Agreement’ between China and Ghana.</p>
      <p>Messrs. Sinohydro Corporation Limited, is the contractor for the project, which will among others, enhance the production and transportation of bauxite and related commercial activities in the area, to improve the livelihoods of people living along the corridors of those selected roads.</p>
      <p>“Bauxite production has supported the nation’s economy dating back to the colonial era to date.</p>
      <p>It is against this backdrop that the President Akufo-Addo-led Administration has decided to revive bauxite mining activities by awarding the road network in this area for upgrading works,” Alhaji Dr. Bawumia said.</p>
      <p>He was addressing a durbar of the chiefs and people of Nyinahin in the Ashanti Region on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Vice-President indicated that the Agreement with the Chinese government, was to help Ghana to work on some selected roads across the country to boost economic activities.</p>
      <p>Alhaji Dr. Bawumia explained that the project would be executed in two phases – ‘Phase One’ and ‘Phase Two’, and was being administered under the Ministry of Roads and Highways.</p>
      <p>The Department of Feeder Roads under the Ministry would provide technical services in the supervision and monitoring of the project.</p>
      <p>The Vice-President assured that the government would not relent in ensuring judicious use of state resources for the benefit of all.</p>
      <p>Mr Simon Osei-Mensah, the Regional Minister, said the government would do due diligence in the execution of the project to promote socio-economic activities in the beneficiary communities.</p>
