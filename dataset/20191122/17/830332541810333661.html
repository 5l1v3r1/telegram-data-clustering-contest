      <p>MILWAUKEE - A man has been arrested after sheriff's deputies found an underground bunker and a stash of weapons in a secluded, wooded area along a river in Milwaukee.</p>
      <p>WTMJ-TV video shows debris over a large area in the woods and a bunker with a cloth partially covering the opening. The Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office says guns and ammunition was recovered from the site along the Milwaukee River. A WTMJ-TV reporter also saw a bow and arrows removed from the location.</p>
      <p>The man was arrested after law enforcement officers responded to a report of shots fired Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Milwaukee Area Technical College owns the land. MATC officials say students do not use the land and there was no threat to the campus community. The Milwaukee County sheriff plans a news conference Friday morning.</p>
