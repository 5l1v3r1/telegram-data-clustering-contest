      <p>What was supposed to be a prayer meeting in Dr JS Moroka Local Municipality council chambers in Mpumalanga, quickly descended into chaos on Thursday when panga-carrying men and women stormed into the room.</p>
      <p>Two men have since been arrested.</p>
      <p>Recalling the moment, Mayor Thulare Madileng told News24 he feared for his life when the group moved towards him.</p>
      <p>He said he was saved by his security detail who whisked him away from the irate mob.</p>
      <p>“They wanted to harm me while we were praying for peace with pastors,” said Madileng.</p>
      <p>“They also insulted my late mother by mentioning her private parts. I live in fear of my life but I always believe that God is great. I was saved by my protectors and the police also arrived later. I will continue working as a mayor and deliver services to our people. I have to upgrade my security and that of my family.”</p>
      <p>He said the crowd also used their pangas to puncture the tyres of his official vehicle and those on the bakkie of one of his protectors.</p>
      <p>The two vehicles were parked on the premises of the municipality when the incident occurred, Madileng said.</p>
      <p>Madileng believes his alleged attackers are supporters of a senior municipality employee whose name is known to News24.</p>
      <p>Madileng was deployed by the ANC and appointed mayor in September 2017.</p>
      <p>The ANC could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
      <p>Mpumalanga provincial police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed the incidents.</p>
      <p>He said two men were arrested in connection with the incident and charged with malicious damage to property.</p>
