      <h1>Liverpool fan has temporary ban lifted after offensive Divock Origi banner</h1>
      <h2>The supporter took the banner to Liverpool's Champions League group match with Genk and unfurled it at the stadium, before it was removed and destroyed by officials</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:19:58+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:19</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, Carl Markham, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> fan whose offensive banner of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/divock-origi">Divock Origi</a> prompted a police and club investigation has had his temporary ban lifted.</p>
      <p>The supporter is now free from suspension from all matches involving the Reds after agreeing to undergo an education course with football's equality and inclusion organisation Kick It Out.</p>
      <p>He will also attend a session within the club's community programme as part of the resolution.</p>
      <p>Liverpool had condemned the Photoshopped banner of Origi for "perpetuating a racial stereotype" when they became aware of its presence prior to the Champions League match at Genk last month.</p>
      <p>However, the incident was not logged with UEFA's match delegate and therefore cannot be subject to disciplinary proceedings by European football's governing body.</p>

      <p>Liverpool fans were seen unfurling an obscene banner, depicting a mocked-up naked Origi with an abnormally large penis, next to the Champions League trophy.</p>
      <p>Chants referencing the size of the manhood of black footballer's have been used for the likes of Romelu Lukaku and Aston Villa midfielder Marvelous Nakamba in the past.</p>
      <p>A Liverpool spokesperson said at the time: "Liverpool Football Club condemns the offensive banner displayed in our section of the ground, prior to kick-off.</p>

      <p>"To be clear, the image used perpetuated a racist stereotype. This is completely unacceptable.</p>
      <p>"We acted swiftly to have the banner removed and we are now working with the local authorities and stadium team in Genk to identify those responsible.</p>
      <p>"Any subsequent action will be taken in keeping with our sanctions process."</p>
      <p>There have been a number of racist-related incidents in football this year, most notably the treatment of black England players in Bulgaria, and social media abuse aimed at Tammy Abraham and Paul Pogba after they missed penalties for their respective clubs.</p>
      <p>Speaking about racist incidents in football last season, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said: "It’s disgusting, another example of something which absolutely should not happen.</p>
      <p>“It’s still only a few people doing it, but the stronger the reaction is from all of us, the more it will help to avoid things like this in the future.</p>
      <p>"If you do something like that, you should not be able to enter a stadium again, in my point of view, in your life."</p>
