        <b>A second man has died following a collision in Lancashire.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The incident happened at around 4am on Wednesday (November 20) when a white Audi S1 collided with a wall, a telegraph pole and then a second wall on Moss Lane, Burscough, near Ormskirk.</p>
      <p>The driver, now named as Conner Stevens, 24, from Sefton, died at the scene. The front seat passenger, Luke Peaurt-Moran, 18, also from Sefton, was taken to Aintree Hospital but has also died.</p>
      <p>Lancashire Police say the Audi, along with a red Fiat 500 Abarth, were stolen during a burglary prior to the collision at an address in the Towngate area of Eccleston.</p>
      <p>The Fiat Abarth was later recovered on Valley Close in Crosby, Merseyside. Officers are keen to trace anyone who may have seen the cars, any other vehicles, or indeed the collision.</p>
      <p>Det Ch Insp Richard McCutcheon, who is leading the investigation, said: “My thoughts and sympathies are with the family of Conner and Luke. Specially trained officers will continue to support them through this extremely sad time.</p>
      <p>“Two young men have lost their lives and so we are determined to find out exactly what has happened.</p>
      <p>“This very much includes the potential route the Audi and the Fiat Abarth have taken and whether they were travelling together. If you saw either of these cars, or indeed any other vehicle that may have been travelling with them, between Towngate in Eccleston, the crash site on Moss Lane and then where the Fiat Abarth was traced on Valley Close in Crosby, we need to speak to you immediately.</p>
      <p>“Similarly, if you have any dash cam footage of the cars or the crash itself, please make contact with us.</p>
      <p>“Lastly, I would urge anyone who was on board the Fiat Abarth or any other vehicle that may be linked to this incident to search their conscience, do the right thing and come forward. There are two families that deserve answers and you may have vital information.”</p>
      <p>Police can be contacted on 101 or Crimestoppers 0800 555 111.</p>
