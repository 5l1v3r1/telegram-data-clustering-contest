      <p>For many of us, we'll be focussing on channelling our hard earned cash into Christmas presents for others this time of year. But as always, I say that there should always be a little left over to spend on ourselves on some <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/5-new-hair-make-up-skincare-products-out-this-week-19354908">new beauty products</a> that are dropping left right and centre. From skincare to hair, body care to candles, here are some of the best bits to hit the shops this week.</p>
      <p>This week I'm most excited about Victoria Beckham's very first skincare product, which has been created alongside scientist and skincare expert Dr Augustinus Bader. <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/victoria-beckhams-first-skincare-product-was-made-with-the-help-of-dr-augustinus-bader-19362526">I wrote up a piece about the cream</a> earlier in the week to express my glee, and luckily have been able to try it since. With a lightweight yet ultra-hydrating formula that leaves skin with a noticeable glow, I'm sold on this one and can sense it is going to be my next (rather pricey) obsession.</p>
      <p>Also out this week is a shampoo by Living Proof that is perfect to counteract damage done by hard water and pollution, particularly if you live in the city. Then there's the Body Serum I can't stop using, along with a limited edition deodorant that has a meaningful campaign behind it.</p>
      <p>Last up is a candle by my favourite candle brand, that's a great alternative if you're not into traditional piney Christmas scents. Keep scrolling to read more about these five new goodies.</p>
