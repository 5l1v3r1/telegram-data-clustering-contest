        <li>In a Friday morning interview on “Fox &amp; Friends,” President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4">Donald Trump</a> admitted to doing the key act driving the House’s current impeachment inquiry of his presidency.</li>
        <li>Specifically, he admitted to holding up military aid to pressure Ukraine’s government to investigate a baseless conspiracy that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election.</li>
        <li>Trump referenced a completely discredited conspiracy theory that CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm he falsely claimed was owned by Ukrainians, got its hands on a Democratic National Committee server.</li>
        <li>Trump added, “We’re looking for corruption, there’s tremendous corruption, and why should we be giving hundreds of millions of dollars to countries where there’s this kind of corruption?”</li>
        <li>In the clip shown below, Trump admits that he withheld military aid appropriated by Congress as leverage to compel a foreign government to launch a politically-motivated investigation.</li>
