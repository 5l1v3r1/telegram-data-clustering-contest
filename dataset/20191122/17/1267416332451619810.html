      <h1>Apple expected to double AirPods shipments to 60 million in 2019</h1>
      <h2>With major competitors out of the way until 2020, Apple is dominating the wireless earbud market</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:38:33+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/jonathan-lamont" target="_blank">Jonathan Lamont</a></address>
      <p>Apple is expected to ship even more AirPods in 2019, according to a <i><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-22/apple-airpods-shipments-are-said-to-double-to-60-million-in-2019">Bloomberg</a> </i>report. The publication says AirPods shipments will double to 60 million units in 2019.</p>
      <p>The numbers come from sources familiar with the Cupertino, California-based company’s production plans. “Much higher” than expected demand for the more expensive AirPods Pro caused the increased shipments.</p>
      <p>Apple released the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/06/airpods-pro-review/">AirPods Pro in the fall</a>. The true wireless earbuds retail for $329 in Canada and offer noise cancellation and water resistance, among other features.</p>
      <p>However, all the demand is pushing Apple’s manufacturing partners to the limits, according to <i>Bloomberg</i>. Multiple suppliers are competing for the business of manufacturing the AirPods Pro, but many still need to build up the technical proficiency.</p>
      <p>Currently, there’s a two to three week wait for the AirPods Pro on <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/MWP22/airpods-pro">Apple’s website in Canada</a>. <i>Bloomberg</i> reports a similar wait time for the U.S.</p>
      <p>Along with the AirPods Pro, the launch of the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/04/10/apple-airpods-2019-review/">$269 AirPods with Wireless Charging Case</a> in March helped stir demand. These AirPods were an iteration on the original AirPods, with little difference save the inclusion of wireless charging, a new H1 chip and “Hey Siri” functionality. Original AirPods are still available as well for $219. <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2016/09/19/airpods-review-canada/">AirPods released in 2016</a>.</p>
      <h3>Biggest competition out of the picture until 2020</h3>
      <p>Further, <i>Bloomberg </i>notes that there’s little in the way of competition at the moment. Microsoft <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/21/microsoft-surface-earbuds-delayed-spring-2020-us/">recently delayed</a> its truly wireless <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/10/02/surface-earbuds-hands-on/">Surface Buds</a> until spring 2020 (although we weren’t going to get them in Canada until next year anyway). Google also plans to <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/10/15/google-truly-wireless-headphone-wireless-pixel-buds/">launch its Pixel Buds in 2020</a>. Finally, Amazon’s Echo buds are <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/06/amazon-echo-buds-fitness-tracking-feature/">available in the U.S.</a> but haven’t made their way to Canada yet.</p>
      <p>Samsung also has its <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/02/21/samsung-galaxy-buds-hands-on/">Galaxy Buds</a>, but <i>Bloomberg </i>reports that Apple ranked as the preferred brand in the U.S. Sony recently launched <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/10/14/sony-wf-1000xm3-review/">excellent true wireless earbuds</a> as well.</p>
      <p>On top of this, Apple owns Beats, and its Powerbeats Pro are also among the top 10 sellers for true wireless headphones.</p>
      <p><i>Bloomberg </i>predicts Apple will keep its 50 percent share of the true wireless market should it resolve the manufacturing troubled and hit its 60 million shipments in 2019.</p>
      <p>It’s good news for Apple as the company tries to adapt to slowing iPhone demand. While the company <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/11/02/apple-iphone-ipad-mac-sales-figures/">no longer shares sales figures</a> for its smartphone products, in the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/10/30/apple-64-billion-revenue-q4-2019/">past quarter</a> the iPhone’s sales shrunk to $33.4 billion USD (about $44.4 billion CAD).</p>
      <p>However, the Wearables, Home and Accessories segment, which consists of the Apple Watch, AirPods, Beats, HomePod and Apple TV groups, generated $6.5 billion USD (approximately $8.6 billion CAD), a growth of 54 percent.</p>
