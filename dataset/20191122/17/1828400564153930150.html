      <h1>Plans unveiled for food and drink hub at former police station in Poulton</h1>
      <h2>Poulton residents are to get a look at ambitious plans to develop the town’s old police station into an artisan food hall.</h2>

      <p>The site was bought by Choice Hotels in February and the company aims to create Bobby’s Yard, offering top local, independent food and drink.</p>

      <p>A public consultation event will be held at the building on Tuesday from 10am to 4.30pm to let people see the plans in detail.</p>
      <p>A team from Choice Hotels will be on hand to talk through designs, answer questions and receive comments on the new proposals.</p>
      <p>The existing station building and its historic features are to be retained.</p>
      <p>Business space for independent delis, cafes or food and beverage retailers will be created at the front of the building with outdoor seating overlooking market square.</p>

      <p>Entrance to the food hall will be through the prominent station archway and the owners say the existing street scene will remain largely unchanged.</p>
      <p>The remainder of the station is to be refurbished and external ancillary buildings at the rear of the station are to be demolished to make way for a 120 cover dining courtyard.</p>
      <p>Set around the courtyard will be several ‘market stalls’ for food and beverage operators and a first-floor mezzanine will offer additional seating and stalls. A spokesman for Choice Hotels said “Poulton is a place where we have been looking to invest for some time, however finding the right property was key.</p>
      <p>“The former police station is an exciting site at the heart of Poulton’s town centre and will allow us to be fully immersed in the Poulton community.”</p>
      <p>Plans come from Stanton Andrews who designed the award-winning Bowland Food Hall at Holmes Mill, Clitheroe.</p>
