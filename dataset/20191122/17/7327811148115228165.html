      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- Eyewitness News has learned that a sweeping rulebook slowdown affected multiple bus lines in Brooklyn during the morning rush hour.</p>
      <p>Buses on the B1, B4, B8, B9, B11, B16, B35, B35-LTD, B37, B43, B61, B63, B67, B68, B69, and B70 routes were unable to leave the yards after drivers requested safety inspections. MTA managers were forced to have each bus inspected before it could be road certified.</p>
      <p>The buses were due to leave from the Jackie Gleason Depot in Sunset Park, Brooklyn at dawn Friday morning when they were stopped for emergency inspections.</p>

      <p>One MTA source told Eyewitness News, "This is a classic TWU rulebook slowdown. Thousands of morning rush hour commuters were affected." The greatest impact was on the B35 bus, which carries the largest number of daily riders in South Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>Tony Utano, President of Transport Workers Union Local 100, released a statement saying,</p>
      <p>"It's all about safety. These are routine inspections. We want to make sure the buses are absolutely safe for our Bus Operators and passengers. These are similar to the spot inspections the DOT did at East New York earlier this week. Defects discovered include faulty emergency window exits."</p>
      <p>Transit Authority President Andy Byford responded saying that these inspections were not supposed to occur during rush hour: "Any action by TWU Local 100 that slows down bus service for riders in Brooklyn or anywhere in NYC is not acceptable. These were routine inspections not directed to occur during rush hour by NYC Transit management. Delaying dozens of buses this morning was unnecessary, inconveniencing New Yorkers just trying to get to work, school, doctors, and hospitals."</p>
