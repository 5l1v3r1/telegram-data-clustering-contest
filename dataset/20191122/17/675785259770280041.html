      <h2>The worst-off 10 per cent of households have lost 7% of their income since 2010, they say – rising to 18% among those families with children. While the retired have largely benefited from the policies</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:43:03+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:43</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Bartlett, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nicola-bartlett/</a></address>
      <p>The poor have been hit almost twice as hard as the rich by tax-and-benefit changes since the Tories came to power, independent experts say.</p>
      <p>Low income households have lost out most from these changes overall -  especially those with children.</p>
      <p>The poorest 10% of households have seen losses of 7% of their income (£800 per year) as a direct result of these reforms; among those with children the figure rises to 18% (£3,800).</p>
      <p>In contrast, the highest-earning 10% of the population have seen their incomes fall by only 4% since the austerity programme was introduced.</p>

      <p>Pensioners have been “broadly protected” since 2010 with above-inflation increases in the state pension– while working-age benefits have been cut sharply in real terms.</p>
      <p>The over 65s have seen on average a 1-2% gain as a consequence of tax and benefit policies.</p>
      <p>Although income tax has been cut due to a rise in the threshold at which it is paid those changes have mostly benefited those on a higher income.</p>
      <p>But the IFS experts said the reforms had strengthened the incentive to work, with workers in poorer households in particular keeping more of an extra pound of earnings.</p>
      <p>Pascale Bourquin, a Research Economist at IFS said: "The tax and benefit system has been subject to a large number of changes since April 2010, including large cuts to working-age benefits, state pension increases and direct tax cuts.</p>

      <p>"But not everyone has reaped the gains or borne the burden of these reforms to the same extent.</p>
      <p>"On average, those in the upper middle of the income distribution have benefited the most from personal tax and benefit reforms and the poorest households have experienced the biggest proportional loss.</p>
      <p>"While pensioners have on average been little affected by these reforms, working-age households with children have lost out – especially low income ones, with the poorest 10% losing £3,800 per year on average."</p>
