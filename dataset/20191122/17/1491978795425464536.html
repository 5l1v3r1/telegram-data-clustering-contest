        <i>Judge gives Natalie Wood suspended jail sentence after ‘deeply foolish’ behaviour</i>
      </p>
      <p>A woman has been given a suspended jail sentence for trying to blackmail a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague">Premier League</a> footballer who jumped out of a hotel window in his underwear after being caught in bed with her.</p>
      <p>Natalie Wood, 28, met the high-profile player on social media but claimed she decided to expose him as a “love rat” after discovering he was in a relationship with another woman.</p>
      <p>Wood previously admitted conspiring to blackmail the footballer with three men, who were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/03/three-men-cleared-of-plot-to-blackmail-footballer">cleared of the charge after a three-week trial in October.</a> Her plea to that charge was dropped following the jury’s verdict and on Friday she admitted an alternative charge of attempting to blackmail the star.</p>
      <p>Judge Martin Picton jailed Wood for 14 months at Bristol crown court but suspended the sentence for 12 months owing to exceptional circumstances.</p>
      <p>He told Wood: “Blackmail is always a very wicked crime and has the power to do great harm to others but I have no doubt that whatever your thoughts about it, you were subjected to significant manipulation.</p>
      <p>“You have been deeply foolish and allowed the attraction of celebrity to put you in the position where you have made some horrible mistakes in your life.”</p>
      <p>The court heard Wood, who is from Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, has since written a letter of apology to the footballer. Peter Asteris, representing Wood, said: “Miss Wood has been something of a victim herself.” He said his client had been stalked online, with abusive messages sent to her and her family.</p>
      <p>During the trial the prosecution alleged a plan was hatched between Wood, Tyrone Coleman, a former contestant on the television programme Take Me Out, his brother Nathan and a friend, Prince Rowe, to film her with the footballer and blackmail him by threatening to sell a “kiss and tell” story to a tabloid.</p>
      <p>The jury was told that Nathan Coleman and Rowe burst in on Wood and the footballer as they were in a hotel room bed and used a phone to film the couple.</p>
      <p>The sportsman, who has lifelong anonymity, fled by jumping from the window in his underwear, ran down a fire escape and took shelter in a nearby restaurant before calling the police.</p>
      <p>Jurors were told the player received a message from Wood threatening to expose him to the media if he did not respond within 24 hours.</p>
      <p>The Coleman brothers and Rowe were acquitted of conspiracy to blackmail. Rowe, 38, from Birmingham, was convicted of two counts of theft, relating to a designer tracksuit worth £1,000 and a £23,000 Rolex watch the footballer left in the hotel room. He was jailed for 16 months for theft. <br/>The judge told him: “It remains the case that you and the others set him up and did so with careful planning and some degree of determination.”</p>
