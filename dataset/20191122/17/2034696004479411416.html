      <p>Edward Norton has recalled the time he saved Leonardo DiCaprio’s life on a diving trip.</p>
      <p>The pair were on an expedition together in the Galapagos Islands when, as Norton recalls, DiCaprio dove off to chase a pack of eagle rays without enough oxygen in his tank.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The director told the story while appearing on <i>The Jonathan Ross</i> show, saying there was “some truth” to the story that he saved DiCaprio’s life, adding: “It has been pumped up a bit more than it deserves.”</p>
      <p>“We were in the Galapagos Islands,” Norton went on. “We were scuba diving with Sylvia Earle, the great oceanographer. I’ve known Leo a long time and he loses his mind around animals. He really has a childlike passion for them. This flight of 100 spotted eagle rays went by below us and I saw the look on his face.”</p>

      <p>Norton continued: “I saw him charging off with this camera that he had and I have been diving since I was 16 years old. I reflectively looked at my watch and was like, ‘We’re very close to the end.’</p>
      <p>“I saw him going off and down and I knew that wasn’t a good thing, so I followed him because I thought to myself, ‘He’s chasing these things, he’s going to run out of air’ — and he did.”</p>
      <p>Edward Norton’s new film <i>Motherless Brooklyn</i> comes out on December 6, and features <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-thom-yorke-give-flea-collaboration-daily-battles-live-debut-2562894">a Thom Yorke and Flea collaboration called ‘Daily Battles’</a>.</p>
