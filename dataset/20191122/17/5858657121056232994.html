      <p>SALT LAKE CITY — Minutes after the end of an NBA game, the Utah Jazz’s home arena has been evacuated because of a suspicious package.</p>
      <p>Most fans had already left the building Friday night when players, coaches and reporters were instructed to leave Vivint Smart Home Arena following Utah’s 113-109 victory over the Golden State Warriors.</p>
      <p>Not long after both coaches finished answering postgame questions from the media, a spokesman for the Jazz told reporters to head outside because of a suspicious package. Outside the arena, reporters were instructed by security to leave the premises.</p>
      <p>Players immediately headed for the exits to get in their cars, or the Warriors’ team bus. Jazz centre Rudy Gobert was still in his uniform as he left.</p>
