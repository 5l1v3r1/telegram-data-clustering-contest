      <h1>Nebraska at Maryland: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>

      <p>Two Big Ten Teams desperate for a win face off on Saturday as 4-6 Nebraska takes on 3-7 Maryland.</p>
      <p>To say that the Huskers have fallen short of expectations might be an understatement at this point. They’re ranked sixth in the Big Ten West – behind the likes of Illinois and Purdue – thanks in large part to a porous defense. Nebraska has not won a game since early-October, and despite scoring at least 21 points in their last three games. One of the Huskers’ top playmakers, Wan’Dale Robinson, <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/nebraska-cornhuskers/update-for-injured-nebraska-rb-wandale-robinson">is nursing an injury</a>, which has to be a concern for the team heading into game day.</p>
      <p>Maryland will try to exploit the Huskers defense if they can. But considering that their defense is combined by an anemic offense, that’s easier said than done. The Terps have scored 20 or more points only four times this year. They’ve also allowed at least 34 points in five straight games.</p>
      <p>Entering the year, most would’ve expected Nebraska to be a giant favorite in this one, but the line has settled in at less than a touchdown.</p>
      <p>Here are the details for the Nebraska vs. Maryland game:</p>

      <p>Will 2019 be a repeat?</p>
