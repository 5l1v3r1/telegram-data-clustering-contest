      <p>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has barred Karvy Stock Broking (KSBL) from taking new clients over alleged misuse of client funds. Further, the NSE has appointed a forensic auditor to examine in detail the alleged cases of misuse of client funds by the broking entity.</p>
      <p>“The Depositories and Stock Exchanges shall initiate appropriate disciplinary regulatory proceedings against [KSBL] for misuse of clients’ funds and securities,” SEBI added.</p>
      <p>The SEBI order said the broking firm credited funds generated by pledging client securities in its own account. Further, an amount of ₹1,096 crore was transferred from the firm to its group entity Karvy Realty between April 2016 and October 2019.</p>
