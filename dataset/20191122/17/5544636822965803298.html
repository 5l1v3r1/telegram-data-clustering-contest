      <p>Anti-graft agency, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), is set to arraign Instagram celebrity, Ismaila Mustapha aka <a href="http://concisenews.global/entertainment/">Mompha</a> before a Federal High Court, Lagos on Monday, November 25, 2019.</p>
      <p>This comes after <a href="http://concisenews.global/entertainment/">Mompha</a> filed a <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/22/mompha-sues-efcc-demands-n5-million-compensation/">suit against EFCC</a> alleging unlawful detention and violation of his rights.</p>
      <p>Mompha asked the court to award N5m against the EFCC for detaining him beyond the constitutionally-allowed period without being charged to court.</p>
      <p>A 14- count criminal charge bordering on money laundering has been filed and served on the suspect who is currently in the custody of the Commission.</p>
      <p>The Bureau De Change operator is to be arraigned alongside his company, Ismalob Investments Limited, the firm through which he allegedly laundered N14 billion.</p>
      <p>The social media celebrity was arrested based on actionable intelligence linking him to fraud and money laundering on Friday, October 18, 2019.</p>
      <p>Mompha who allegedly perpetrate his fraudulent activities under the guise of being a Bureau de Change operator used the BDC business he jointly owns with his siblings, as a decoy to launder his proceeds of crime.</p>
      <p>In a related development, Kayode Philip and Hamza Koudeih, high valued targets in Organized Cyber Syndicate Network (OCSN) will also be arraigned during the week.</p>
      <p>They have been duly served with a 24-count charge bordering on conspiracy and money laundering.</p>
      <p>Hamza allegedly operates two firms namely THK Services Limited and CHK Properties Limited through which he allegedly laundered about N19billion.</p>
