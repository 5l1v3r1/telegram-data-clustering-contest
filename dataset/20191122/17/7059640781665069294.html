      <h1>Nordstrom Rings Up Earnings Surprises</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:46:34+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/author/1757735/stephen-guilfoyle/all.html" target="_blank">STEPHEN GUILFOYLE</a></address>
      <p>... And the winner is Edward Yruma, retail analyst over at KeyBanc who on Aug. 22 slapped a Buy rating -- and a $48 price target -- on Nordstrom ( <a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/quote/JWN.html">JWN</a>)  in response to a mixed second-quarter earnings report. Yruma, like a salmon swimming upstream, saw potential for better margins for this firm, while the rest of the analyst community was less optimistic. By the way, the shares did not take and hold the $30 level until Sept. 5. </p>
      <h3>The Quarter: Off-Price Sells</h3>
      <p>One thing investors have come to understand as Q3 earnings season comes to its completion is that for retailers, e-commerce rules, off-price is cool, and full-price is well...  just not very cool. Nordstrom reported Q3 earnings per share of 81 cents, 21% year-over-year growth after two successive quarters of earnings contraction.   By the way, no hocus-pocus here, these are earnings according to the generally accepted accounting principles. FactSet reports that 20 of the 30 names in the Dow Jones Industrial Average reported adjusted earnings. There are many solid reasons for this, and the point is really neither here nor there for investors, but this investor does notice these things.    Revenue generation tells an interesting story here. At $3.67 billion, the headline number beats expectations, but lands -2.1% from the same quarter last year. This is Nordstrom's fourth consecutive quarter where the firm posted declining sales. The numbers within that number tell a familiar story. Digital grew by 7%, and now accounts for 34% of all sales. Full-Price hit the tape at a 4.1% loss, but Off-Price showed growth of 1.2%.    Gross margin expanded to 34.3% vs. 33.3% last year. The firm notes an ability to increase earnings before interest and taxes margin through inventory discipline, and mentions $170 million in expense savings year-to-date. Nordstrom also makes mention of growing margin across Full-Price, despite declining sales growth. As far as growing margin is concerned, co-president Erik Nordstrom made note that half of all digital sales were driven through in-store pick-up, two-thirds in the Los Angeles area. We already know from the Target ( <a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/quote/TGT.html">TGT</a>) earnings call that at least for that firm, this reduces overhead quite considerably. </p>
      <h3>Operating on a Higher Level, but Is There a Higher Need?</h3>
      <p>There is no doubt that Nordstrom is facing down the same challenges that are the rest of retail in general as well as the department store sub-industry more specifically. Do I want to jump on board just yet? I am not convinced, but I can recognize that this firm is executing on a higher level than it has been in its recent past, and probably more so than the direct competition. The question is simply one of need. Think about it: How well does the best blacksmith in your town do? Does your town have a blacksmith? </p>
      <h3>Hot Off the Chart</h3>
      <p>Well look at that. The shares are hot Friday morning. The key is that level in between $38 and $39. Not only is $38.80 a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the year to date sell-off, the spot has also served a stiff resistance in both October and November.   </p>

      <p>  In essence, those of you who bought these shares for a trade, already have your trade. Investors, though, would have to contend with nearly immediate headwinds if initiating at this time. I don't know everything, but if flat the name, and I am, I would rather wait for a pull-back to $33/$34, or buy on momentum above $38.80 than buy the name just below that spot.     </p>
