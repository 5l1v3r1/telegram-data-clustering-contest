      <p>The barristers of two students who raped a woman so severely she may not be able to have children, have argued in court that they should be given lighter sentences because they’re Italian.</p>
      <p>Ferdinando Orlando, 25, and Lorenzo Costanzo, 26, have been jailed for seven-and-a-half years each, after raping the schoolteacher at the Toy Room Club in Soho, central London.</p>
      <p>They were seen on CCTV high-fiving and hugging each other after they repeatedly raped the 23-year-old over the course of 16 ‘intense’ minutes and filmed the attack on February 25, 2017.</p>
      <p>The pair were then seen holding up her limp body, rearranging her dress and leaving their victim alone in the toilets in extreme pain.</p>
      <p>The victim, who suffers with PTSD, was left needing surgery after the attack and said she could not understand how her vicious attackers saw her rape ‘like a badge of honour’.</p>

      <p>But their barristers told Isleworth Crown Court the pair simply had a ‘naive view of consent’ and deserve lighter sentences because they come from a ‘different cultural background’.</p>

      <p>Prosecutor Allison Hunter told the court: ‘The injury [the victim] sustained was so significant it caused her to be admitted for emergency surgery within hours of its discovery, and who knows what the lasting impact of that surgery will be.</p>
      <p>‘She stayed in the hospital receiving medical treatment for seven days after. It may have impacted her ability to have a family in the future.</p>
      <p>‘That’s not something that’s factored in but clearly contributed to the psychological harm experienced by her’.</p>
      <p>But the defence argued the pair had shown ‘exemplary behaviour’ prior to the attack and were ‘family’ men, while Orlando said in a statement that he ‘acted like an immature kid’.</p>
      <p>The students – who had girlfriends at the time – claimed the victim consented but the jury found she was too intoxicated to agree.</p>
      <p>Sarah Elliott, for Orlando, told the court in defence: ‘There are very significant differences between Italian young men and their cultural background to those in England’.</p>
      <p>Orlando and Costanzo were each found guilty of two counts of rape by a jury at Isleworth Crown Court. Judge Giles Curtis-Raleigh sentenced them to seven-and-a-half years in prison each on Friday.</p>

      <p>Police said the two men had escaped justice for more than a year after the attack, by returning to Italy, but were eventually caught after Costanzo returned to the UK to watch an Arsenal versus Milan football match.</p>

      <p>Costanzo was arrested at Heathrow Airport in March, 2018, while Orlando later contacted police and returned to the UK by appointment where he was arrested.</p>
      <p>Orlando was studying a postgraduate degree in International Law, while his friend was taking a postgraduate masters degree in Business and Management.</p>
      <p>CCTV footage showed the men taking it in turns to kiss the visibly drunk victim who was unsteady on her feet and plying her with shots.</p>
      <p>Just eight minutes after they met, they lead her into the club’s maintenance room and raped her.</p>
      <p>They are seen afterwards graphically re-enacting the attack, before watching back footage of the attack on a mobile phone, which they show to another person.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the victim, who had no recollection of what had happened, remembers being in ‘incredible pain’ and barely able to walk after club staff found her an hour later.</p>

      <p>She was helped home by a French couple and a housemate called an ambulance who alerted the police.</p>
      <p>Costanzo left the UK just hours after the attack, with Orlando returning home about a week later.</p>
      <p>In an impact statement, the victim said the rape has left her in ‘constant fear’ and unable to relax or enjoy evenings out with her friends.</p>
      <p>The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, added: ‘When I found out more than one man was involved I felt violently ill with the thought that two men did something this horrible … to me.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>After discovering her attackers had filmed the rape, she said she felt ‘so angry’ it ‘made me want to vomit’.</p>
      <p>She added: ‘I truly struggle with how two humans could behave like such animals to another person and think of that as funny and like a badge of honour.</p>
      <p>‘I did not consent to having sex with either or both of these people that night or at any other time.’</p>
      <p>Detective Sergeant Rebecca Woodsford, from the Metropolitan Police, said: ‘Both men put the victim through a traumatic ordeal.</p>
      <p>‘She has been left with severe psychological injuries and was injured that night, which caused her and police to suspect she had been a victim of assault, she was not aware until the defence put their case to her in court, the full extent of what had happened in that maintenance room.’</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Toy Room nightclub said: ‘We’re appalled by this incident, and our thoughts go out to the victim.</p>
      <p>‘The safety of our guests is our top priority, and we’ve done everything we can to co-operate fully with the police, to help them bring this case to trial and ensure a conviction.’</p>
