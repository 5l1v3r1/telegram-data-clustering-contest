      <p>Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy, the other day, went on to say that Andhra Pradesh does not have huge financial resources to build huge projects like Amaravati and the capital should grow naturally. He also added that Amaravati has not come from heaven and it is not an immediate priority for the government.</p>
      <p>Sources in the Government say that it is almost certain that Amaravati will be scrapped as the Capital and at the same time, the Government may not spend any money on any other capital. “In the name of Decentralization, we will shift the High Court to Rayalaseema and some other Government Departments to other districts. That is the best this Government can do,” a source in the Government said.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/politics/jagan-gives-yet-another-friday-a-miss/">Jagan </a>sent a message to the officials. “Our priorities are clear. Navaratnalu implementation is our priority. We already made it clear to the people. They voted us to Power with a sensational majority after seeing the manifesto. So do not stress yourself about the other projects,” the Chief Minister said.</p>
      <p>Experts warn that too much focus on freebies without wealth creation will ensure that Andhra Pradesh goes bankrupt.</p>
