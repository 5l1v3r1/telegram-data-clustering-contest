      <p>Terrifying video footage showed the moment a trans-oceanic flight’s engine exploded over the Pacific, as loud gunshot-like bangs filled its cabin.</p>
      <p>The Philippine Airlines flight to Manila experienced a total engine failure shortly after take-off from Los Angeles International Airport Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>Video footage shot from inside the cabin shows huge orange flames shooting from one of the jet’s engines, with the Pacific visible below.</p>
      <p>Passenger Adam Taylor from Long Beach also captured the flames illuminating toddler daughter Maddie’s face.</p>
      <p>He began filming to capture Maddie’s reaction to the plane taking off, but ended up recording something far more sinister.</p>

      <p>The plane declared an emergency and returned to LAX within an hour of taking off, with no serious injuries reported.</p>
      <p>Passengers on the ground filmed it coming in to land, with flames and black smoke seen pouring out of its faulty engine.</p>
      <p>One passenger told CBSLA As soon as it lifted off the ground, we heard four large bangs.</p>
