      <p>Those unsatisfied by the everyday gift can peruse a peculiar mix of artisan products at the <a href="https://thismonkeysgonetoheaven.vendecommerce.com/pages/2019-weirdos-holiday-market">Weirdos Holiday Market</a> on December 14 and 15 at The Hall at the Holy Trinity Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral.</p>
      <p>Curated by Rachel Zottenberg, owner of Betamax Gallery and oddities shop This Monkey’s Gone to Heaven, the market features a mix of items geared to shoppers looking for gifts that are “decidedly left-of-centre.”</p>
      <p>To give you an idea, there will be deconstructed plastic dolls transformed into wacky planters, strange jewellery created from real forest-foraged fungi, unusual but totally usable pottery pieces and Ukrainian Easter eggs.</p>
      <p>This year, there will be 35 individual vendors, as well as a large cooperative table featuring products from 10 additional artisans.</p>
      <p>One of Vancouver’s most famous weirdos, Jaik Puppyteeth, will also return with his cynical and hilarious prints and T-shirts that make people laugh while also making them uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>Plus, you can also take home your very own weird Santa photo.</p>
      <p>On top of finding the strangest Christmas gift ever, there will also be Tarot card readings, sword-swallowing, drag queens, a hot-dog buffet like no other and seasonal drinks on offer from Parallel 49 Brewing Company, along with more adult and kid-friendly beverage options.</p>
