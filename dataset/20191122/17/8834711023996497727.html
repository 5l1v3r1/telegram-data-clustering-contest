      <h1>SAA To Restore Full Flight Schedule This Weekend</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:03:13+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/suzziegitau/" target="_blank">SG Editor</a></address>
      <p>With a wage deal finally signed to end the strike, South African Airways (SAA) has announced it will restore its full flight schedule in stages over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The eight-day strike by National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) and the South African Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) has cost the airline about R50 million a day and has left thousands of travellers frustrated.</p>
      <p>SAA said the unions had agreed to a 5.9% wage hike retrospective from 1 April this year. The increases will be paid in February 2020.</p>
      <p>However, the salary increases and back pay will be subject to funds being secured by the airline.</p>
      <p>The mood among SAA workers who were on strike was jovial on Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>It’s understood a task team has been set up that will consist of Numsa and Sacca leadership. Their work will be to fight corruption, among other things.</p>
