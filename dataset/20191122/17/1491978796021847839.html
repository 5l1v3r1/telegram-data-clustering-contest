        <i><b>Prof John Denham </b>argues that to be English is, for many, not wanting to be ignored, <b>Jim Grozier </b>thinks it is time for someone to come up with new, ‘neutral’ names for the various parts of England, while <b>Rev Ray Skinner </b>debates devolution</i>

      <p>Alex Niven (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/20/englishness-union-radical-vision-nationalisms">‘Englishness’ was never enough to build a nation on</a>, Journal, 20 November) makes the reasonable point that English identity as it now exists is unlikely to become the single unifying national identity of England. Britishness faces the same problem. But like too many on the left, his desire to dismiss the English prevents him from asking who they are and what they want.</p>
      <p>While there is not a single monolithic Englishness, those who emphasise their English identity, and who were more likely to vote leave, do not, by and large, share Boris Johnson’s Anglocentric British nationalism. They are, very largely, not the people in power in England, whether in corporate business, the media, politics or academia. They are more likely to live in places that have been on the losing side of social, economic and political change for 30 years, outside the liberal cultures of the metropolitan city centres. To be English is, for many at least, not wanting to be ignored any longer, to want to be heard or – to coin a phrase – to “take back control”. There is no successful future for England, or the union, that does not involve bringing the English back into the national conversation. Denying they exist or slamming the door in their face is not a good way to start.<br/><b>Prof John Denham</b><br/><i>Centre for English Identity and Politics, University of Southampton</i></p>
      <p>• I heartily agree with Alex Niven that “building up the English regions” is a much more practical solution to the current identity crisis of the UK than “the quest for an artificial, unitary Englishness”. Who can honestly say that they identify with a region stretching from Land’s End to Berwick, defined largely by geography, and encompassing such huge disparities in wealth and opportunity on the way? Perhaps it is time for someone to come up with new, “neutral” names for the various parts of England, independent of past affiliations and rivalries, as was done during the major upheaval in local government in the 1970s, and to consign the name “England” to the waste bin of history.<br/><b>Jim Grozier</b><br/><i>Brighton, East Sussex</i></p>
      <p>• Alex Niven suggests that there should be a revival of the movement for regional devolution, following the campaign to defeat the yes vote in the 2004 north-east England devolution referendum. I called for devolution of north-east government in my parish magazine in a mining village near Sunderland back in the 1970s. Unless we soon have a government capable of uniting our once United Kingdom, I call for that again, from my current home-in-exile.<br/><b>Rev</b><b> Ray Skinner</b><br/><i>Bidborough, Tunbridge Wells</i></p>
