      <h1>More Blackpool parents are teaching their children at home</h1>
      <h2>Around 300 children in Blackpool are now being taught at home - which is more than twice the national average.</h2>

      <p>The figure was given to a meeting of Blackpool Council's Audit Committee during a discussion about levels of educational attainment in the town.</p>
      <p>It is an increase on the same time last year, when the number of home-schooled pupils was given out as 187.</p>
      <p>The meeting was told taking GCSE exams was not a mandatory part of home learning, with parents only being obliged to provide 'a suitable education'.</p>
      <p>Minutes from the September 12 meeting of the committee say parents had to fund exams themselves if their children had lessons at home, and "the associated costs were a significant barrier to low income families."</p>
      <p>Councillors were also told one of the most significant barriers to learning in the town was parenting skills.</p>
      <p>However more support was being offered to families to encourage them to engage more with their children's education, including through a Literacy Strategy aimed at improving reading and writing abilities within households.</p>
      <p>An Inclusion Plan has also been introduced to improve attendance at schools among pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND).</p>
      <p>It is hoped this would tackle exclusion rates among these pupils which had increased because "many young people with SEND exhibited behavioural issues which impacted on exclusion rates."</p>
      <p>Best practice is also being shared among schools, while a scheme called Teach Blackpool was being used to improve teaching standards in the town.</p>
      <p>Better teacher recruitment methods were also being introduced next year, while a nurturing programme had been successfully introduced at St George's School which had helped with skills development.</p>
