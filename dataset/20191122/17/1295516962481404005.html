      <h1>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker Poster Showcases the Light and Dark Sides</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:11:41+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Conner</a></address>
      <p>The new <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-episode-ix/">Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</a></i> international poster from Germany sees both the light and dark sides of the Force on display, with Rey in the center to divide the image while blue and red tints either side.</p>
      <p>With droids to her left and the First Order to her right, Rey stands confidently as she hoists the former Skywalker lightsaber high above her head. To her left is Chewbacca, with Finn, still with a blue tint, to her right, both of whom are firing crimson-red bolts -- Finn from his blaster and Chewie from his iconic bowcaster.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, an unmasked Kylo Ren appears just beneath Rey, with his reforged helmet above. Notably, he's abutted by both the red and the blue tints, possibly signaling hope for those banking on a Ben Solo redemption.</p>
