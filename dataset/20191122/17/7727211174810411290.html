      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:19:36+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/lottie-gibbons/" target="_blank">Lottie Gibbons</a></address>
      <p>Two serious crashes <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/north-wales">on the A55</a> have caused <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/traffic-and-travel">significant delays as emergency services</a> deal with the situation.</p>
      <p>Only one lane on the eastbound carriageway of the A55 at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/north-wales">Bodelwyddan has reopened.</a></p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/live-lane-closed-a55-bodelwyddan-17300834">North Wales Live</a> , there is still some oil on the road causing the "nearside lane" to close.</p>
      <p>Police confirmed the lane is closed as a result of the crash between the Three-ways Garage and the turnoff for Bodelwyddan.</p>

      <p>It is understood that one HGV had overturned and one other vehicle involved. The driver was out of vehicle and crews made the vehicle electrically safe.</p>
      <p>The spokeswoman added that they believe a structural engineer is still on scene assessing the bridge and lanes will be reopened soon once the HGV is moved.</p>
      <p>Traffic is said to be very slow eastbound with queues around seven miles long.Â </p>
