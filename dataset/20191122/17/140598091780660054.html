      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:12:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/phoebe-southworth/" target="_blank">Phoebe Southworth</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/paul-mccartney/">Paul McCartney</a> feared playing Glastonbury would endorse the "'mass killing of badgers", Brian May has revealed.</p>
      <p>The Beatles star is said to have rang up the Queen guitarist for advice ahead of his headline performance at the world famous venue next year.</p>
      <p>May, 72, had refused his own invitation to perform after clashing with organiser Michael Eavis over the morality of badger culls. </p>
      <p>Eavis had branded May's opposition a<b> </b>"danger to farming",<b> </b>prompting calls from activists for performers to boycott the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/glastonbury-festival/">festival at Worthy Farm in June 2020</a>.</p>
      <p>Sir Paul, 77, was apparently concerned that by accepting the invite, it would suggest he supported killing the wild animals.</p>
      <p>May wrote on social media: "Paul was kind enough to phone me about this before he accepted the invitation.</p>
      <p>"He was concerned that he might be thought to be endorsing the current mass killing of badgers.</p>
      <p>"Paul, a great campaigner on behalf of animals, is firmly against the Badger Cull.</p>
      <p>"I told him he should not feel any obligations - that my reluctance to play was based on the personal comments Michael Eavis has made about me."</p>
      <p>May previously called the practice  a "tragedy and unnecessary crime against wildlife", and claimed he was "frequently insulted" by Eavis because of his views.</p>
      <p>Sir Paul eventually decided to accept the invite and May wished him luck with his performance.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "I work daily with people who disagree with me in matters like this - it's necessary in order to move forward.</p>
      <p>"But I don't have to work with people who insult me who are ignorant of the work I do.</p>
      <p>"People can change, and I'm always open to that. In the meantime I wish Paul and his band a great gig."</p>
      <p>Badgers are culled in an attempt to reduce the spread of bovine tuberculosis.</p>
