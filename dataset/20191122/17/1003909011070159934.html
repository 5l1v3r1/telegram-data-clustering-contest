      <h1>East Village welcomes M2 to the neighbourhood</h1>

      <p>East Village’s latest building is getting ready for its new tenants, who will enjoy four floors of unparalleled views of the Bow River and Riverwalk.</p>
      <p>M2 is a four-floor building built by local firm XYC Design + Development that emcompasses retail on the ground level with office space on the second and third floors, topped with a very special residence on the top floor.<br/>Its urban black and white design fits neatly against one neighbour, Alt Hotel, while its modernity is grounded by the red brick of the historic Simmons Building next door.</p>

      <p>XYC Design + Development’s president Kate MacGregor is the mind behind the new building — and it’s her first development. XYC, incidentally, is a combination of her hometown YYC, Calgary’s airport code, and NYC, for New York City, where she lived while attending Columbia University for a master’s degree in architecture, following her degree in civil engineering at University of Calgary.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there could have been a better project on this site,” says Kate Thompson, vice-president development for Calgary Municipal Land Corp., the developer of East Village. MacGregor’s pitch during the request for proposals for the spot hit all the right notes for the community.</p>
      <p>The design of the building was a unique combination that challenged MacGregor’s creativity from both her civil engineering training as well as her architectural side. The site has a unique shape, being long through the middle and bookended with both a wide and a narrow end. The Calgary rule that the building can’t cast a shadow on the Bow River dictates a stepped-back shape as it gets taller. The building also has no “back” side to it, as it’s accessible on all sides and doesn’t have a back alley.</p>
      <p>M2 was designed by Brooklyn-based nArchitects, where some of MacGregor’s architecture professors and she worked for two years.</p>
      <p>The main floor of M2 features 7,500 square feet of space that will be home to a bike store by Bow Cycle and a restaurant by the Concorde Group, with operations starting in 2020.</p>
      <p>MacGregor, who grew up in Bowness, remembers her parents buying her first bicycle at age 5 at Bow Cycle.<br/>“Bowness made a similar transition as East Village, and Bow Cycle was an important part of that transformative effect,” says MacGregor.</p>
      <p>The bike store will activate the RiverWalk side of the building, with the business able to expand onto the patio when weather permits. It will focus on e-bike sales and rentals.</p>
      <p>The Concorde Entertainment Group — the company behind such restaurants as Model Milk and Anju — will host a restaurant with 2,000 square feet of patio spilling out onto RiverWalk Plaza.</p>
      <p>“In 2008 I left for New York and that was real transformation in the restaurant and entertainment industry in Calgary. When I came back, I went to Model Milk, and I couldn’t believe it — I could have been in New York,” MacGregor says.</p>
      <p>M2’s second floor will be home to Harvest, a prairies-based venture group that helps start-ups with disruptive ideas and helps develop them into globally competitive companies. Behind Harvest is one of the founders of SkipTheDishes.</p>
      <p>The third floor will be shared by North West Capital, a Calgary venture investment firm specializing in the energy industry, a cleantech startup called Quebe Technologies Inc., and the new offices of XYC Design + Development.</p>
      <p>The fourth floor completes the building’s live-work-play mission — a private live-work home with about 1,800 square feet, two bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms and a private deck that enjoys the flowing views of the Bow River and people on RiverWalk.</p>
      <p>The home’s long and unique shape lends to tall ceilings in the great room and kitchen at one end, and tapers to a more intimate eight feet in the master bedroom at the other end of the home.</p>
      <p>There are thoughtful design elements in the home — a nesting spot for pet dogs to curl up beside the linear fireplace, a chandelier that references the shape of Bloom, an art installation by Michel de Broin on St. Patrick’s Island that is part of the view from the living room, and a jewel of a half-bathroom off the kitchen.</p>
