      <p>As we approach 2020 and the end of the 2010s, <b>Billboard </b>decided to look back on the 100 songs that defined the decade. Three K-pop artists were listed on <a href="https://www.billboard.com/100-songs-that-defined-the-2010s">Billboard's 'The 100 Songs that Defined the Decade' list</a>:<b> BTS</b>, <b>Psy</b>, and <b>Girls' Generation</b>.</p>
      <p>BTS's <b>"I Need U"</b>, Girls' Generation's <b>"I Got A Boy"</b>, and Psy's <b>"Gangnam Style" </b>were included in the list alongside hits such as<b> "Let It Go"</b> by <b>Idina Menzel </b>and <b>"Uptown Funk"</b> by <b>Bruno Mars.</b> </p>
      <p>BTS's "I Need U" was lauded for its storytelling and emotional arrangement, while Girls' Generation's "I Got A Boy" was praised for its unique use of sounds and genre-bending nature. Psy's "Gangnam Style" obviously made the cut as its viral popularity became a part of meme culture and broke global YouTube records with its music video, becoming the first video on the platform to reach 1 Billion views.</p>
      <p>Congratulations to all three artists!</p>
