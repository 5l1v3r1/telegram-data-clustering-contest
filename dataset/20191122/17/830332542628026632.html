      <p>Yanya Thao rents the home and said he had just gotten into bed when the crash happened.</p>
      <p>"I heard some police sirens and a car start screeching. Then there was a really loud bang, into the house and then the whole house started shaking," Thao said.</p>
      <p>The car and the house suffered significant damage, according to the report.</p>
      <p>"It literally knocked the whole bed to the door in the room, and you couldn't open the door," Thao said. </p>
