      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/avengers/">Avengers</a>: Endgame could have had another huge battle scene featuring Thanos’ army, but had to be cut – because, you know, the film was already three hours long.</p>
      <p>In the new artbook for the movie, concept illustrator Josh Nizzi spoke about the prospect of squeezing in another fight.</p>
      <p>Alongside a string of drawings, he explained how it was hoped the purple one would be seen going up against a military alien race, reports <a href="https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/11/22/avengers-endgame-thanos-army-cut-a-huge-battle-with/">Comicbook.com</a>.</p>
      <p>However, it didn’t come to fruition.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Marvel wanted to show how powerful Thanos was even before he had any of the Stones.</p>

      <p>‘There was going to be a huge battle sequence where he fights a military alien race. The aliens actually did show up in the film but only for a few seconds before being killed by Gamora and Nebula.’</p>

      <p>Not quite the epic battle scene originally thought out, then.</p>
      <p>Jerad Marantz, costume concept artist, described the army and called coming up with the design ‘challenging’.</p>
      <p>‘After looking at the source material, I wanted them to have a biomechanics quality to them,’ he said.</p>

      <p>‘There was concern that the Outriders may look too much like a Venom symbiote, and the challenge was to ensure they had a unique look.</p>
      <p>‘To achieve that, I decided to go biomechanical with them and incorporate the same shapes that are used in Thanos’ armor and Proxima Midnight’s and Corvus Glaive’s.’</p>
      <p>This isn’t the only scene that had been cut out of the epic superhero flick, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/avengers-endgames-deleted-katherine-langford-scene-shows-tony-starks-heartbreaking-goodbye-daughter-11083681/">as Katherine Langford was set to appear as the grown-up version of Tony Stark’s (Robert Downey Jr) daughter Morgan, who was played by Lexi Rabe in the movie.</a></p>
      <p>The deleted scene, revealed by Disney+, shows Tony encountering the adult version of his daughter, saying: ‘Guess it worked.’</p>

      <p>Morgan goes on to tell him: ‘Yeah, it worked for me. I got to live, grow up. For you, I can’t answer.’</p>
      <p>Then, as if we weren’t sobbing enough, she tells her dad: ‘I love you’, with him (of course) answering: ‘I love you 3000’.</p>
