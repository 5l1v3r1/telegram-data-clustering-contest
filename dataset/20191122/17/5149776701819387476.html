      <p>A cancer survivor faces jail for helping to smuggle 2.6 million cigarettes hidden inside 46 washing machines.</p>
      <p>The operation was uncovered by a HM revenues team which raided a storage unit on the Trent South Industrial Park in the city.</p>
      <p>Some cigarettes had been removed from the washing machines, which had been specially hollowed out. Other packs were still inside but were to be stacked into cardboard boxes.</p>
      <p>Company owner Rafal Szczepanik, 42, denied being involved in a conspiracy to evade Â£756,422 excise duty. But he was found guilty by a jury at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/courts">Nottingham Crown Court</a>.</p>
      <p>Szczepanik of Leeway Road, Southwell, was remanded in custody. He has been held in prison since the raid in June.</p>
      <p>Four other men have pleaded guilty to the charge. All five will be sentenced when a date is fixed, probably before <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a>.</p>
      <p>At the trial, Szczepanik said he was unaware of the contents of the washing machines. He had a four-year lease on the unit as part of his business.</p>
      <p>He said that he had received cancer treatment three times. This left him needing to take 13 tablets every morning.</p>
      <p>When asked about false number plates found in his possession, he said these were used so lorries could evade queues at the Polish border. He said trucks could be stuck for nine days.</p>
      <p>He accepted that he used false documents to get a lease for the Nottingham storage units. But he said this was because of problems he had with a similar unit in London.</p>
      <p>Gareth Weetman, prosecuting, asked: "Do you tell lies if it would help your business?"</p>
      <p>He replied: "I think everybody lies in business."</p>
      <p>He told QC Mark Cotter, defending, that he was unaware of the cigarettes before he was arrested outside the unit.</p>
      <p>He said that he owns a bonded warehouse near his Polish home, which is six miles from the Ukrainian border.</p>
      <p>His customers include people from Russia and the Ukraine. He said: "They buy goods around the whole of Europe and the world. They send them to us in containers and lorries."</p>
      <p>The cigarettes were two brands which are illegal in the UK, 2,662,240 Minsk cigarettes and 8,460 carrying the Pect name.</p>
