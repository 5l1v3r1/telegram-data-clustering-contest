      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> is back after a seemingly never-ending international break and there’s no doubt where the majority of the focus will be following <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a>’s shock appointment at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a>.</p>
      <p>Spurs travel to West Ham for what is likely to be a typically feisty London derby in what will be Mourinho’s first match in charge since replacing Mauricio Pochettino. Liverpool, meanwhile, will hope to maintain their advantage at the top with Jurgen Klopp’s table toppers facing a trip to Crystal Palace, while rapidly improving Chelsea face Manchester City.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/football/competition/10932509">Betfair</a> Ambassador Dimitar Bebatov reviews the action exclusively for Metro.co.uk…</p>
      <h3>West Ham vs Spurs</h3>
      <p>All the eyes are going to be on this game and all the photographers will be queuing up to get that picture of Mourinho in the Spurs dugout. The players are going to want to show him how good they are but for me time is a little bit short to get a big reaction from them straight away so I can see them having a few difficulties at West Ham.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/football/market/1.164635460">Dimitar’s prediction</a>: 2-2</p>
      <h3>Betfair Exchange Odds</h3>
      <p>West Ham 7/2, Draw 7/2, Spurs: 4/5</p>
      <h3>Arsenal vs Southampton</h3>
      <p>For me Arsenal need the win for sure. It is the same story with them, they play good football, they keep the ball but in the end no trophies. Last year they didn’t manage to get in the top four and if they want to get there this season these are the games that they need to get results from and build some consistency.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/football/market/1.164636225">Dimitar’s prediction</a>: 2-1</p>
      <h3>Betfair Exchange Odds</h3>
      <p>Arsenal 8/15, Draw 4/1, Southampton: 6/1</p>
      <h3>Bournemouth vs Wolves</h3>
      <p>Bournemouth are playing well but I like Wolves as well – they are playing good football and putting themselves about in the Europa League. Honestly, I think this one will be close but in the end I think home advantage will see Bournemouth nick this one.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/football/market/1.164636378">Dimitar’s prediction</a>: 1-0</p>
      <h3>Betfair Exchange Odds</h3>
      <p>Bournemouth: 2/1, Draw: 12/5, Wolves: 7/4</p>
      <h3>Brighton vs Leicester</h3>
      <p>Leicester are flying! It’s unbelievable, Jamie Vardy is scoring for fun. I want them to continue their great form because in the end I want them to be up there in the top four, I can’t see anything but another convincing display from Brendan Rodger’s side.</p>
      <p>Dimitar’s prediction: 0-3</p>
      <h3>Betfair Exchange Odds</h3>
      <p>Brighton: 3/1, Draw: 11/4, Leicester: 11/10</p>
      <h3>Crystal Palace vs Liverpool</h3>
      <p>This is an obvious one, the way Liverpool are playing what can go against them? You expect at some point that someone will beat them but I don’t think this will be the case this weekend, despite a number of their players returning from the international break. They are so good at the moment and their manager knows how to get the best out of all his players.</p>

      <h3>Betfair Exchange Odds</h3>
      <p>Crystal Palace: 7/1, Draw: 4/1, Liverpool: 40/85</p>
      <h3>Everton vs Norwich</h3>
      <p>Norwich are struggling, and they haven’t won since they beat City, they have only scored two goals in the Premier League in two months. Something needs to pick up there before it’s too late. I can see Everton, who also need the points, capitalising on how poor Norwich have been.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/football/market/1.164635001">Dimitar’s prediction</a>: 2-0</p>
      <h3>Betfair Exchange Odds</h3>
      <p>Everton: 2/5, Draw: 9/2, Norwich: 8/1</p>
      <h3>Watford vs Burnley</h3>
      <p>Watford are having the best of times at the moment, but they did get the win last time out before the break. Burnley have been hit and miss this season but they are comfortably mid table. I think coming back from the break these teams will be refreshed so I think it will be a draw.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/football/market/1.164635613">Dimitar’s prediction</a>: 1-1</p>
      <h3>Betfair Exchange Odds</h3>
      <p>Watford: 6/4, Draw: 12/5, Burnley: 9/4</p>
      <h3>Man City vs Chelsea</h3>
      <p>City need to bounce back, they are now nine points behind Liverpool and if they lose this one, Chelsea will become title contenders. Frank Lampard’s side are on a great run and they can cause City problems. But saying that, Guardiola will prepare his team to the maximum and they can’t afford any more slip ups whilst Liverpool are flying. They need the win and I think they will get it at the Etihad.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/football/market/1.164635154">Dimitar’s prediction</a>: 3-2</p>
      <h3>Betfair Exchange Odds</h3>
      <p>Man City: 40/85, Draw: 4/1, Chelsea: 6/1</p>
      <h3>Sheffield United vs Man United</h3>
      <p>What the **** are Sheffield United doing in fifth place in the Premier League, can someone explain that to me!? Joking aside, they are playing some really good football, their 3-5-2 formation is slick, going to five at the back when someone is attacking them is so effective, they are a solid team and for me they are one of the surprises of the season. Of course I want United to win, but sometimes you have to look at things from the perspective of how things are, it will be a tough game and I think both teams will get a point.</p>

      <h3>Betfair Exchange Odds</h3>
      <p>Sheffield United: 14/5, Draw: 5/2, Man United: 6/5</p>
      <h3>Aston Villa vs Newcastle</h3>
      <p>Aston Villa have have had some good results recently against teams around them and so have Newcastle. Aston Villa will want to create some more breathing space between them and the relegation zone and these are the games that they need to get points from. I think they will have enough at home to get past Newcastle.</p>
