      <h1>Santa Clarita Shooter's Gun Lacked Serial Number Despite CA Law</h1>
      <h2>The Santa Clarita shooter’s gun was allegedly a homemade gun that had no serial number, despite California requirements that a serial number be affixed to homemade firearms.</h2>

      <p>The suspect used the gun November 14 to wound five people, two fatally, and to take his own life.</p>
      <p>Fox News <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-high-school-shooter-used-untraceable-ghost-gun-sheriff-says">reports</a> Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva indicated the pistol was “an unregistered, untraceable ‘ghost gun’ assembled by hand from various parts.”</p>
      <p>Villanueva did not say whether the attacker had assembled the gun himself or acquired it from someone else.</p>
      <p>The Officer of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/consumer-alert.pdf">notes</a> that state law requires a serial number to be affixed to homemade guns. The serial number makes the gun traceable to the person who assembled it. But Villanueva <a href="https://twitter.com/LASDHQ/status/1197546848082247680">told</a> ABC7 the gun was “assembled from parts” and “had no serial number.”</p>
      <p>In addition to requiring a serial number for homemade guns, California has universal background checks, an “assault weapons” ban, a 10-day waiting period for gun purchases, a requirement that would-be gun buyers get a certificate from the state showing they understand firearm safety, a limit on the number of handguns a person can purchase, and a 21-year-old minimum purchase age for handguns and long guns.</p>
