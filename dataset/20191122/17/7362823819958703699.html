      <h1>Will Ferrell says Christopher Walken is annoyed by 'SNL' cowbell sketch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T17:20:04+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 17:20</time> by <a rel="author">Eric Hegedus</a></address>
      <p>Christopher Walken would really prefer less cowbell.</p>
      <p>The 76-year-old cult film icon apparently feels scarred from a popular “Saturday Night Live” skit he was part of during the 25th season of the late-night NBC show in 2000.</p>
      <p>In it, the guest host played Blue Oyster Cult producer Bruce Dickinson, who instructs fictional band member Gene Frenkle — portrayed by then-cast member Will Ferrell — to use “more cowbell” on the group’s landmark hit “Don’t Fear the Reaper.”</p>

      <p>The skit also featured Chris Kattan, Chris Parnell, Horatio Sanz and Jimmy Fallon (who has a hard time keeping himself from laughing throughout the sketch).</p>
      <p>“Guess what? I got a fever, and the only prescription is more cowbell!” Walken implores before the group records the track during the nearly six-minute-long skit.</p>

      <p>Ferrell, 52, who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/will-ferrell-set-to-host-saturday-night-live-for-fifth-time/">returns to host</a> the show for the fifth time this Saturday, shared Walken’s feelings Thursday during a visit to “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.” He said he visited Walken backstage at a theater performance many years after the sketch aired and the actor told him, “You know, you’ve ruined my life.”</p>
      <p>Walken — who won a 1979 Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for “The Deer Hunter” — reportedly told Ferrell that his fans are a bit overzealous about the sketch.</p>

      <p>“‘People during the curtain call bring cowbells and ring them. The other day I went for an Italian food lunch and the waiter asked if I wanted more cowbell with my pasta bolognese,'” Ferrell said Walken told him backstage. “And I think he was really mad at me. He had a little smile, but …”</p>
      <p>Ferrell, who said he will spend Thanksgiving with family in Boston this year, suggested that Walken’s career only has three high points.</p>

      <p>“From ‘The Deer Hunter’ to ‘Pulp Fiction’ to ‘More Cowbell’ — that’s all he gets,” Ferrell said. “What are ya gonna do?”</p>
      <p>Let’s hope Harry Styles — who hosted “SNL” last weekend — doesn’t have a similar reaction to a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/sara-lee-reacts-to-harry-styles-raunchy-snl-sketch/">now-infamous sketch</a> he did involving Sara Lee cakes.</p>
