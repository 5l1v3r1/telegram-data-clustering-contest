      <p>Reuters reports the latest headlines, citing that China has reportedly asked its big banks to increase loans to the manufacturing sector.</p>
      <p>This effort to ramp up the country’s slowing economic growth comes after a couple of rate cuts by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC).</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, USD/CNY remains on the front foot near 7.0315, as the Chinese yuan remains pressured by the US-China trade confusion.</p>
