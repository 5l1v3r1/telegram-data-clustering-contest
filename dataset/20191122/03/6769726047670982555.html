      <h1>Court fines man for dumping household items in Jandabup</h1>

      <p>A MAN who dumped unwanted household items in State Forest in Perth’s north has been ordered to pay more than $1500 in littering fines and court costs.</p>
      <p>Liam Tristram was charged following covert surveillance by investigators from the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER) and Keep Australia Beautiful Council (KABC) at a known hotspot for littering and illegal dumping.</p>
      <p>Joondalup Magistrate’s Court heard Mr Tristram entered State Forest 65 on Warbrook Road, Jandabup on October 3, 2018 in a blue Nissan Navara with a load of waste in the rear of the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Inspectors who checked the site found a discarded washing machine, barbecue and other household items.</p>
      <p>Magistrate Linda Keane accepted that while Mr Tristram was remorseful for his actions, the penalty imposed had to reflect the need to deter people from similar behaviour.</p>
      <p>He was fined $800 and ordered to pay more than $750 in court costs after being convicted of littering.</p>

      <p>Illegal dumping can be reported to the <a href="https://www.der.wa.gov.au/your-environment/51-reporting-pollution/117-reporting-pollution-to-land-including-waste-and-litter">Pollution Watch Hotline</a> on 1300 784 782 or to <a href="mailto:pollutionwatch@dwer.wa.gov.au">pollutionwatch@dwer.wa.gov.au</a>.</p>
      <p>KABC also runs a <a href="https://www.kabc.wa.gov.au/report-littering">litter reporter scheme</a>, which has more than 15,300 registered reporters and has already issued more than 660 litter infringements this year.</p>
      <p>Chairman Michael Aspinall said KABC issued almost 2300 infringements for littering last financial year, and more than 660 have been issued since July.</p>
      <p>“People littering and illegally dumping may think they are saving money, but they are showing contempt for WA’s environment and it will ultimately cost them much more when they are caught and convicted by the courts,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The DWER inspectors have developed a significant investigative network and it will continue to work with the KABC to do everything it can to track down those responsible for littering in WA.”</p>
