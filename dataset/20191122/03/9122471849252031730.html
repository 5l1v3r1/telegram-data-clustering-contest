      <h1>Urban Meyer Has Hilarious Response To Minnesota’s Loss To Iowa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T03:10:09+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 03:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Former Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer left the sideline for the broadcast booth following the 2018 college football season.</p>
      <p>Meyer is a standout analyst for FOX Sports and frequently makes visits on the Big Ten Network to break down games from the previous weekend.</p>
      <p>Arguably the game of most consequence last weekend in the Big Ten occurred at Kinnick Stadium as the Iowa Hakweyes handed the Minnesota Gophers their first loss of the season.</p>
      <p>P.J. Fleck’s team had dreams of a potential College Football Playoff berth, but the loss to Iowa makes that dream much more difficult.</p>
      <p>Meyer is familiar with heartbreaking losses at Kinnick Stadium with a playoff berth on the line – and he’s very aware of that.</p>
      <p>When asked about Minnesota’s loss, Meyer said he knows Iowa well.</p>
      <p>“They played a good team. We all know Iowa. Shoot, I know Iowa,” Meyer said about the Hawkeyes this week.</p>

      <p>Meyer and the Buckeyes had dreams of a College Football Playoff berth during the 2017 season. However, a trip to Kinnick Stadium resulted in a 55-24 loss for Ohio State – which ultimately cost the team a shot at the playoff.</p>
      <p>Meyer has to be happy with where the Buckeyes stand now, though.</p>
