      <h1>Bauchi ex-governor denies misappropriating N47b Paris Club largesse</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T03:39:11+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 03:39</time> by <a rel="author">Adamu Abuh, Abuja</a></address>
      <p>Former Governor Muhammed Abubakar has faulted claims that he frittered away over N47.3 billion Paris Club refund to Bauchi State.</p>
      <p>He maintained that the allegations were falsehoods peddled by the Bauchi State Funds and Assets Recovery Committee “working in cahoots” with his successor, Governor Bala Mohammed.</p>
      <p>Abubakar, who spoke yesterday in Abuja through Umar Mohammed, his ex-Housing Commissioner, vowed to sue his successor to clear his name.</p>
      <p>Accusing the committee of embarking on a witch-hunt, he said the Paris Club largesse and the bailout funds from the Federal Government were used to offset backlog of workers’ salaries.</p>
