      <p>Students protesting the appointment of a Muslim professor in Banaras Hindu University's Sanskrit department will end their demonstration today.</p>
      <p>They reached their decision after meeting BHU Vice-Chancellor Rakesh Bhatnagar, who they say pledged corrective measures within 10 days.</p>
      <p>BHU's Chancellor, Giridhar Malviya (the grandson of BHU founder Madan Mohan Malviya), and a number of senior politicians have defended the professor, Firoze Khan.</p>
      <p>Sanskrit "has vastness", Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"The Constitution of our country has vastness. Any teacher can teach Sanskrit in a university," she said.</p>
      <p>The protesters, on the other hand, say only a Hindu can do so.</p>
      <p>But on Wednesday, some students marched on campus in support of Firoze Khan, who has so far been unable to take classes.</p>
