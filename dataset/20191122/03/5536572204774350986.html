      <h1>REPORT: New England Patriots Will Not Be Re-Signing Antonio Brown</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T03:56:34+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 03:56</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>On Thursday, there was a report that suggested the Patriots had “kicked the tires” on a reunion with Antonio Brown with internal discussions about the Pro Bowler.</p>
      <p>It was enough to make Patriots fans get extremely excited since the team is really lacking at the WR position and could use a boost.</p>
      <p>As it turned out, the rumors were just rumors because <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/sources-patriots-not-interested-bringing-back-antonio-brown">Tom E. Curran of NBC Sports Boston</a> and Jeff Howe of The Athletic reported that the Patriots are not interested in bringing back Brown.</p>

      <blockquote>“Two sources with knowledge of the Patriots thinking scoffed at the idea Antonio Brown would rejoin the Patriots this season,” Curran wrote. “When one source was asked if there was a chance the wideout – who was with the Patriots for less than two tumultuous weeks in September – might have a chance at rejoining the team, this was the two-word response. ‘What’s changed?'”</blockquote>
      <p>Curran stated hurt feelings from Brown’s Twitter posts are not the reason they don’t want him back, but more so the team’s fear of more issues “cropping up down the road.”</p>
      <p>Brown played one game for the franchise, catching 4 passes for 56 yards and one touchdown.</p>
