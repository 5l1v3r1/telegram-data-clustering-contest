      <h2>As Dynamos and CAPS United were winding preparations for Sunday’s Harare Derby yesterday, workers were also busy setting up the stage at the National Sports Stadium for a church service.</h2>

      <p>The giant stadium, which is set to host one of the country’s biggest fixtures, has been booked for a church service which is set to end tomorrow.</p>
      <p>The stadium is run by the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing.<br/>The service is likely to worsen the pathetic state of the turf at the stadium, which has not been maintained to expectations, and has become bumpy.</p>

      <p>Some Warriors have said it’s the worst condition of the surface they have played on at the stadium they use for their home matches.</p>
      <p>With the rains that have been pounding Harare this week, there are fears the playing surface could be in its worst condition for the Derby.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, as CAPS United were busy putting together the final preparations for the Harare Derby at the National Stadium B arena, workmen were also installing the stage for the church service inside the stadium.</p>
      <p>There are concerns from some stakeholders that football, which regularly pays levies to the stadium authorities throughout the year, was not being given a priority.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time the Harare Derby has been overshadowed by religious events.<br/>Two years ago, the PSL were forced to postpone the tie after the facility was booked by Nigerian Pastor Chris Oyakhilome for a special service of his Christ Embassy Ministries.</p>
      <p>CAPS United, however, paid little attention to what was happening behind them at the giant stadium yesterday with midfielder Ronald Chitiyo said they are focusing on the derby.</p>
      <p>“Obviously, this is going to be a very difficult game. But one thing that I know for sure is that it’s not about the results of the past weeks,’’ said Chitiyo.</p>
      <p>“It’s about how you are going to play on match day.<br/>“Even if Dynamos are number 15 and CAPS United number 16 on the log standings, this game will always be a difficult match.</p>
      <p>“So, this is a very difficult game for both teams because it’s a Derby. In our situation, at CAPS United, we want to win the league and we do not want to drop points, more so against Dynamos.</p>
      <p>“But Dynamos are playing for pride and a possible top four finish. It’s more difficult for us but Dynamos always have the pressure from their fans who do not want to lose to CAPS United.</p>
      <p>“We are ready however, to handle it.’’<br/>CAPS United go into the Derby on top of the log standings after going two points clear of nearest rivals Chicken Inn and FC Platinum with three games to go.<br/>They have 55 points.</p>
      <p>Dynamos are fifth, 11 points behind but they have a chance to push for a top four finish.<br/>The Green Machine have been handicapped by the suspension of striker John Zhuwawu, who has amassed three yellow cards ahead of this assignment.</p>
      <p>In their last game against Yadah, CAPS were also advised another striker, Newman Sianchali, was ineligible because of suspension.</p>
      <p>Goalkeeper Tonderai Mateyaunga, who picked up a groin injury last week, is set to undergo fitness tests to ascertain whether he makes the team.</p>
      <p>His replacement, Prosper Chigumba, was blamed for the first goal Yadah scored as they came back from two goals down to force a draw.</p>
      <p>“We had a tough talk on our first day of training. We sat down as a team, we discussed our shortcomings in the Yadah game,’’ said CAPS United coach Darlington Dodo.</p>
      <p>“The players appreciated and they were the ones who were actually telling each other the truth, that we did not do the right things in that game.</p>
      <p>“When you have a team that can score within 25 minutes two goals, and then you concede within a very short space of time, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it was the defence which was not doing well. “It was the whole team.</p>
      <p>“We all agreed that there were some things that we did not do right, defensively as a team, and there were some individuals who did not apply themselves.</p>
      <p>“When I make a mistake, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the ball should just go (towards goal) and we concede.</p>
      <p>“As players, it must be in us that If I make a mistake, you also cover for me. That’s team work and that is what we lacked in some instances.” <a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/nss-to-host-church-service-ahead-of-derby/"><b>The Herald</b></a></p>
