      <h1>McLaughlin tops opening Newcastle 500 practice despite hairy Turn 11 moment</h1>

      <h3>Scott McLaughlin topped the timesheets in opening practice at the Coates Hire Newcastle 500 – but it wasn’t without a moment of pants-on-the-end-of-your-seat action for the champion-elect.</h3>
      <p>McLaughlin’s session-best 1:10.6092s lap was just 0.0122s faster than David Reynolds (#9 Penrite Racing ZB Commodore) with Jamie Whincup (#88 Red Bull Holden Racing Team ZB Commodore) a further 0.0905s behind.</p>
      <p>The 30-minute session featured a key moment for McLaughlin at the re-profiled Turn 11 hairpin midway through the session, with the #17 Shell V-Power Racing Team Mustang bowling a big wide after he locked the left-front heading into the corner.</p>

      <p>With the wide expanses of Newcastle Harbour all drivers can see heading into the corner, you could have forgiven McLaughlin for clenching as he approached the turn, only to release the brake and slowly take to the run-off area.</p>
      <p>However, there was no such luck for Nick Percat, who was trailing McLaughlin earlier in the lap and nosed the #8 Timken ZB Commodore into the Turn 7 barriers.</p>
      <p>Andre Heimgartner was first on the scene and had to take to the run-off to avoid Percat’s stricken car.</p>
      <p>Percat managed to return to the lane with superficial damage, but ended the session 23rd after completing just eight laps in the session.</p>
