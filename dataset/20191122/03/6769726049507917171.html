      <h1>Wanneroo Council not to review childcare centre decision following petition</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T03:59:30+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 03:59</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Jarvis</a></address>
      <p>WANNEROO Council has rejected a request from residents to review a decision to approve a childcare centre in Banksia Grove.</p>
      <p>Nearby residents submitted a 203-signature petition in September asking the council to review its <a href="https://www.communitynews.com.au/wanneroo-times/news/banksia-grove-childcare-approved-after-sat-appeal/">May decision</a> to approve Atlantis Group’s plans for a childcare centre at 10 Harbour Elbow, now 103 Greenvale Place, following a State Administrative Tribunal appeal.</p>
      <p>Mariginiup resident Constance O’Brien said the scale of the development did not comply with planning regulations for the special residential block and Banksia Grove resident Karun Cowper said residents felt “let down by the council in this matter”.</p>
      <p>Mrs O’Brien said a District Planning Scheme 2 provision only allowed a single dwelling to be built on special residential blocks and asked the council to seek independent legal advice.</p>
      <p>However, the council heeded its internal legal advice at the November 12 meeting, which said a childcare centre was a discretionary use and therefore capable of being approved.</p>
      <p>Residents had raised concerns about the impact a childcare centre would have on the amenity of the rural area, including increased traffic and safety of horse riders on Greenvale Place.</p>
      <p>A separate report tabled at the same council meeting reviewed the local planning policy for childcare centres and submissions received regarding proposed changes.</p>
      <p>The council agreed to proceed with a revised policy that would guide assessment of development applications for childcare centres.</p>
      <p>The policy aims to ensure childcare centres are located in “accessible and convenient” locations, ideally beside non-residential uses.</p>
      <p>The City had also been <a href="https://www.communitynews.com.au/wanneroo-times/news/council-moves-to-ban-childcare-use-in-special-residential-areas/">reviewing uses permitted in special residential areas</a> and is running public consultation on a change to not allow childcare centres, catteries and consulting rooms in those zones.</p>
