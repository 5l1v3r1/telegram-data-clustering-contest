      <p>Nokia 9.1 PureView, the successor to Nokia 9 PureView may be the next big smartphone offering from HMD. Now a known tipster has sent us some images of what looks like the Nokia 9.1 PureView dummy wearing a case.</p>
      <p>The images reveal a wider smartphone than Nokia 9 PureView but with the similar Penta-camera module. Design wise also the Nokia 9.1 looks a bit different from Nokia 9 PureView if one notices the back and side profiles.</p>
