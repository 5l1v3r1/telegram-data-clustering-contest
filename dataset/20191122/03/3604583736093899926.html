      <p>BELOVED AFL identity Danny Frawley will be remembered with a test of grit in Ballarat Cycle Classic, an event he has been pedalling from its start line.</p>
      <p>The SPUD100 is a new 160-kilometre (100-mile) endurance ride taking riders up the notorious Mount Buninyong nationals climb, through the potato farms of Danny "Spud" Frawley's home district Bungaree and through the picturesque Mollonghip and Dean back to Lake Wendouree.</p>
      <p>All to help fight cancer with research.</p>

      <p>Frawley has been Cycle Classic ambassador since the inaugural event in 2008, proud to do what he could using his name and profile to boost Fiona Elsey Cancer Research Institute's major fundraiser.</p>
      <p>He once quipped he had to make sure to <a href="https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/4445863/frawley-gets-behind-the-cycle-classic/">"lose a bit of that Christmas pudding"</a> before tackling Mount Buninyong.</p>
      <p>Frawley died in a single-car crash near Wallace in September.</p>

      <p>Cycle Classic committee member Rob McClure said the SPUD100 was a fitting way to pay tribute to a long-time, big supporter of the event.</p>
      <p>"Danny had a huge heart and was an active part of our team," Mr McClure said.</p>
      <p>"He will be immensely missed at the Classic and we'd like to remember him and his contribution to cancer research in a way that might encourage others to give generously."</p>

      <p>FECRI has set an ambitious $300,000 target for next year's Cycle Classic to help establish a breast cancer research program in Ballarat. This will build on an initial donation from Melbourne philanthropist Mary-Paula Williamson that will allow the Institute to recruit an internationally recognised senior researcher, specialising in breast cancer, by early next year.</p>
      <p>AFL identities Michael Roberts and<a href="https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/6391091/farewell-danny-frawley-he-was-generous-in-his-time-and-energy-for-cancer-research/"> Michael Malthouse are among event ambassadors</a> with three-time world 24-hour mountain bike champion and cancer survivor Jess Douglas will also be a face of the event.</p>
      <p>Fellow Cycle Classic ambassador and Ballarat Olympian Steve Moneghetti said it was great to have a ride named in tribute to Frawley, who had always been on his bike in some form for the event.</p>
      <p>Moneghetti said it was great to have the extra personal challenge for those who were ready to step up their distance.</p>
      <p>A runner by trade, Moneghetti enjoys the chance to ride for a change and get out of his comfort zone.</p>
      <p>"I intended to ride the 80-K last year and ended up doing the 100 so I might commit to the hundred now and if I get a bit silly I might ride the 160 - but you've got to respect the distance," Moneghetti said.</p>
      <p>"I love the challenge of getting out and seeing some country roads. I run on roads closer to Ballarat so for me to train and participate in this event I get outside my comfort zone to regions I don't see with other riders."</p>
      <p>Ballarat Cycle Classic is on February 16. Registrations are open. For details on all events, <b>visit <a href="https://ballaratcycleclassic.com.au/">ballaratcycleclassic.com.au</a>.</b></p>
