      <h1>US calls for Iran crackdown videos, internet slowly returns</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T03:37:33+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 03:37</time> by <a rel="author">The Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — As the internet slowly is being revived across Iran after a dayslong, government-imposed shutdown amid demonstrations, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is calling on Iranians to send the U.S. videos “documenting the regime’s crackdown on protestors.”</p>
      <p>Pompeo’s tweet early Friday comes as pockets of Iran saw internet over landlines restored.</p>
      <p>He wrote: “The U.S. will expose and sanction the abuses.”</p>
      <p>Authorities have said the internet may be entirely restored soon, suggesting Iran’s government put down the demonstrations that began Nov. 15 over government-set gasoline prices rising.</p>
      <p>Amnesty International says protest unrest and a subsequent security crackdown killed at least 106 people. Iran disputes that figure without offering its own. A U.N. office earlier said it feared the unrest may have killed “a significant number of people.”</p>
