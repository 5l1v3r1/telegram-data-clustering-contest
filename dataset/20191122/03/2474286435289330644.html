      <p>This week year nine students from Moree Secondary College have been out in the town getting a feel of the work place.</p>
      <p>Over this past week, Tarley Page has been working at Fairview Retirement Village and has been really enjoying it so far.</p>
      <p>Tarley said she chose to work at Fairview, because she is really interested at working at a hospital in the future and thought she could get the feel of it in the similar environment of Fairview.</p>
      <p>Whilst on work experience Tarley has been involved in many aspects of the facility.</p>
      <p>"I have been in the activities room helping them [the elderly] do stuff," Tarley said.</p>
      <p>"We do painting, play games and set up for church.</p>
      <p>"I also walk around with them."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Bella McGowen another MSC year nine student has been doing her work experience at the Moree Veterinary Hospital.</p>
      <p>She said she chose to do her first week of work experience at the vets because she likes to work with animals and thought it would be interesting.</p>
      <p>During her work experience, Bella has been involved in many areas of the clinic.</p>
      <p>She has been watching surgeries, learning how to properly care for animals, petting and playing with the animals and helping the surgeons by passing them tools during the surgery.</p>
      <p>"[The highlights of my week have been] playing with dogs and watching surgeries on dogs," Bella said.</p>
      <p>Bella said she is now very much considering a career in the veterinary industry "because it is interesting, fun and I like working with animals".</p>
      <p>Year nine work experience will continue next week.</p>
