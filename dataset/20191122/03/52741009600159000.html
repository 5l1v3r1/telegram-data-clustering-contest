      <p>TORONTO — An Ontario court has struck down a provincial government order that made some post-secondary student fees optional.</p>
      <p>Last December, Premier Doug Ford's cabinet approved the order and later put it into effect in what it called the "Student Choice Initiative."</p>
      <p>The Canadian Federation of Students and York Federation of Students filed a legal challenge, arguing the move was a politically motivated attack on student unions and services that threatened university independence.</p>
      <p>The groups said the change was arbitrary and threatened student-led programs such as clubs, campus newspapers, food banks and other support services, and part-time jobs.</p>
      <p>The government contended that students should have more choice as to which campus services they support.</p>
      <p>In its unanimous ruling, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice Divisional Court said the government's decision to enact the policy was beyond its legislative authority.</p>
      <p>"Requiring that universities allow students to opt out of student association fees and other "non-essential" services is inconsistent with the universities' autonomous governance," a panel of justices said in the ruling released on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Canadian Federation of Students and the York Federation of Students said they would hold a joint news conference Friday to respond to the ruling.</p>
      <p>"Today the Ontario Divisional Court has confirmed what students already knew: The Student Choice Initiative is unlawful, and the Ford government acted beyond their authority," Kayla Weiler, a CFS representative, said in a release.</p>
      <p>"Doug Ford's attempt to wipe out students' unions under the guise of giving students 'choice' has been exposed for what it really was: an attempt to silence his opposition."</p>
      <p>Jenessa Crognali, press secretary for Attorney General Doug Downey's office, said the ruling is being reviewed.</p>
      <p>"As this matter is in the appeal period, it would be inappropriate to comment," she wrote in an email. </p>
      <p>Full-time students in Ontario pay about $300 in fees each year, none of which goes to the institutions themselves.</p>
      <p>Last month, York University estimated that 60 per cent of such fees — about $1.25 million — were made optional.</p>
      <p>The government had threatened to claw back operating grants to schools that didn't abide by its directives.</p>
