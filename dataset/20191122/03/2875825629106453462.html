      <p>Anthony Joshua will go into his rematch against Andy Ruiz Jr £10,000 lighter after losing a bet with training-camp team member Jonathan Constant.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/anthony-joshua">Joshua</a> will bid to win back his back his WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles when he meets Ruiz Jr for a second time in Saudi Arabia on December 7.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/andy-ruiz-jr">Ruiz Jr</a> pulled off one of the biggest shocks in boxing history when he stopped Joshua back in June after knocking the Brit down four times.</p>
      <p>But Joshua's team looked in relaxed mood in a video posted from their training camp, which showed Constant trying to complete 25 wide-grip pull-ups in response to a challenge from the former Olympic boxing champ.</p>
      <p>According to a tweet posted by TalkSport's online boxing editor Michael Benson, Joshua didn't believe that his friend and backroom team member Constant could complete the quarter-century of pull-ups - and bet him £10,000 he couldn't rise to the challenge.</p>

      <p>The video shows Constant sail through the pull-ups at first, before tiring and then putting in a herculean effort to complete the 25th rep with the massive cash prize at stake.</p>
      <p>After successfully completing the challenge, he can be seen being congratulated by team members while Joshua laughs, with cheers heard in the background.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> users responded to the video saying the camp looked in happy and confident mood ahead of next week's huge rematch.</p>

      <p>And Joshua himself is <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/anthony-joshua-wants-world-bow-20926599">feeling confident</a> ahead of the bout.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11865835/ruiz-jr-vs-joshua-2-anthony-joshua-says-i-want-everybody-to-bow-to-me">Sky Sports</a> : "Apparently I'm fighting the quickest hands and the best fighter in the division. So once I beat him I want everybody to bow to me.</p>
      <p>"I'm confident that I know what I need to do now, and I've prepared to the best of my capability to go out and perform. Performance leads to the win."</p>
