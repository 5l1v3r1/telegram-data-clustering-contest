      <p>According to a report from EntertainmentTonight.com, Lindsie Chrisley recently got candid regarding a tragedy she suffered a few years ago. During an episode of <i>Coffee Convos Podcast With Kail Lowry and Lindsie Chrisley</i>, the reality star shared that she miscarried following the birth of her 6-year-old son, Jackson, whom she had with Will Campbell.</p>
      <p>Chrisley never knew the sex of the baby, however, Ten-Kate suggested it may have been a girl. While trying to make her feel better, Ten-Kate stated that she was probably up in heaven calling down to her 6-year-old.</p>
      <p>As it was previously reported, in May of this year, Chrisley explained on her Instagram that people are always asking her whether or not she wants to have another child with her man. The reality star said that people ask her repeatedly: “are you going to have another baby?”</p>
      <p>The reality star shared that the short answer was “maybe,” however, it has been over six years since she had Jackson. The star admitted she frequently wonders what it would be like to have another child. Chrisley’s latest revelation comes after the news of her father’s legal problems with his wife, Julie.</p>
