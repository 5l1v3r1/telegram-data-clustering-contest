      <h1>In City of Joy, Viswanathan Anand eyes Magnus Carlsen's number</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T03:52:58+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 03:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Archiman-Bhaduri-15921.cms" target="_blank">Archiman Bhaduri</a></address>
      <p>KOLKATA: It cannot get bigger than this. The penultimate leg of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Grand-Chess-Tour">Grand Chess Tour</a> (GCT), a rapid and blitz meet, begins at the Bhasha Bhawan auditorium of the iconic National Library on Friday with eight of the world's top 15 Grandmasters in the fray.</p>
      <p>In terms of quality and pedigree, India hasn't staged a finer global <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/chess">chess</a> event. In a way, it was long overdue. India as a chessplaying nation has grown in leaps and bounds over the years. But while Indian youngsters have continued to amaze the chess world by their sheer talent, big chess events missed the country.</p>
      <p>English GM Nigel Short welcomed the development. "I am delighted that such an important event will take place in Kolkata. Indeed, I would like to see India host more events of this magnitude, given the immense strength and depth of chess in the country,” he told ToI.</p>
      <p>Three world champions — two current and one former — will showcase their skills over the next five days. Leading the pack is none other than World champion <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/magnus-carlsen">Magnus Carlsen</a>, who will be challenged by India No. 1 and five-time former World champ <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/viswanathan-anand">Viswanathan Anand</a> and world Random Fischer winner Wesley So.</p>
      <p>The other GMs who will be vying for honours are China's Ding Liren, Russian Ian Nepomniachtchi, Armenia's Levon Aronian, Anish Giri of the Netherlands and Hikaru Nakamura of USA, along with two wild-card entrants — India No. 2 Pentala Harikrishna and No. 3 Vidit Gujrathi.</p>
      <p>The GCT, inspired by the legendary Garry Kasparov and launched in 2015, comprises of two classical and five rapid and blitz tournaments, followed by a grand finale which will feature the top four players from the previous seven legs played across four continents (Africa, Asia, Europe and America).</p>
      <p>Kolkata is hosting the crucial seventh leg, which will finalize the four qualifiers for the London finale (from December 2).</p>
      <p>Going by the current standings, Carlsen has already booked his London ticket, as he sits on top of the table way above the rest with 54.5 points. Chinese No. 1 Liren lies second with 37.8 points and has all but made the cut. Although Levon Aronian is tied fourth with Russian Sergey Karjakin on 36.5 each and behind Maxime Vachier-Lagrave of France</p>
      <p>(36.8), the Armenian GM is likely to secure a berth since both Karjakin and Vachier-Lagrave have already featured in five legs — maximum a player can compete in.</p>
      <p>Anand (32) is in the reckoning to earn the fourth berth. India's first GM will look to make a good start in the event — which will see nine rounds of rapid over the first three days and then 18 rounds of blitz in two days — and get into the groove early.</p>
      <p>Anand had won the blitz tournament held in the city last year and has done reasonably well in this year's GCT legs, finishing second in Paris and third in Romania. He will also look to get the record straight against Carlsen in his own country after having lost the World championship match to the Norwegian in Chennai in 2013.</p>
