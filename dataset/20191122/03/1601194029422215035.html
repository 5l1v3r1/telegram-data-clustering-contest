      <p>Former WWE Divas, The Bella Twins turned 36 yesterday, November 21. WWE Chairman <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/vince-mcmahon">Vince McMahon</a> posted a tweet wishing the former Divas well, heaping praise on the duo.</p>
      <p>The Bella Twins were once an integral part of the WWE's Women's division. The twins made their debut way back in 2008 and were WWE mainstays for the next several years, minus a brief split in 2012-13. Both made several WrestleMania appearances, with the most notable one being their outing against AJ Lee &amp; Paige in a tag team match at WrestleMania 31 in a losing effort.</p>
