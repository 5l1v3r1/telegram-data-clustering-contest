      <p>Speaking yesterday to journalists at his office, the Arusha Region Tanesco manager Herini Mhina said all problems encountered by the wananchi after they are connected to power by the ‘vishoka’ will be history as they are well mobilized to put them out of the criminal business.</p>
      <p>He said they have put in place various strategies against the breed including registration of all electrical contractors within the EWURA system and whoever is not registered will not be allowed to do electrical work.</p>
      <p>He said: “We will deal with all electrical contractors who sign customers’ forms outside Tanesco offices because that is not allowed, because that has to be done inside our offices within the laid down procedure and there will be no bureaucracy.”</p>
      <p>He said they will ensure all electrical contractors who do wiring work are registered by EWURA so as to eradicate bureaucracy and misunderstandings encountered by the wananchi in the region, stressing that they will make a close follow-up of this to eliminate unregistered electrical contractors.</p>
      <p>EWURA manager for Northern Zone, eng Lorivii Long'idu said the procedure for electrical contractors is clear and also in accordance with the law hence they have mobilised to ensure their registration is sustainable so that power customers get consummate service.</p>
      <p>He said in so doing last month EWURA met with all electrical contractors in the region for discussions on how to solve the challenges they faced so that they offer better services to customers.</p>
      <p>He also asked the wananchi to send their complaints on energy and water services to EWURA.</p>
      <p>He also said they found out that many electrical contractors were not registered in the areas they operate in the region; hence EWURA has planned to deal with this shortcoming.</p>
      <p>The plan to eradicate ‘vishoka’ is a result of complaints from power users of unscheduled powercuts and when power suddenly returns it destroys their electrical appliances.</p>
