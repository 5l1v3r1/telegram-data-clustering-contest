      <h1>Patriots Insider Has The Latest On Potential Antonio Brown Signing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T03:32:28+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 03:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Earlier Thursday, a report suggested the New England Patriots were considering re-signing wide receiver Antonio Brown.</p>
      <p>The report came after Brown issued a public apology to Patriots owner Robert Kraft.</p>
      <p>“Mr.Kraft I apologize sincerely to you and your organization! All I wanted to be was an asset to the organization; sorry for the bad media and the drama! Thank you sincerely AB,” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5DZe7jBKcg/">Brown said on Instagram</a>.</p>
      <p>According to a report from former Patriots tight end and current New England analyst Christian Fauria, the Patriots <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-east/new-england-patriots/report-patriots-considering-bringing-antonio-brown-back">“kicked the tires”</a> on adding Antonio Brown.</p>
      <p>Well, that report was short-lived.</p>
      <p>Another Patriots insider weighed in and made it clear the Patriots are NOT re-signing the former All-Pro wide receiver.</p>
      <p>
        <span dir="auto">“The Patriots will not be re-signing Antonio Brown, according to a source. Those rumors can be put to rest,” Patriots insider Jeff Howe said.</span>

      <p>Brown played in one game for the Patriots earlier this season. He showed immediate chemistry with Brady, connecting for four receptions for 56 yards and a touchdown.</p>
      <p>The Patriots have struggled on offense this season, though those struggles have been masked by the best defense in the NFL. Adding Antonio Brown would certainly help, but it looks like that won’t happen after all.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest.</p>
