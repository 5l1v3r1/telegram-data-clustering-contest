      <p>Soap star Andrew Whyment is the new favourite to win I'm A Celebrity following his hilarious first Bushtucker trial entrance.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> sensation, 38, entered the Jungle tonight alongside Cliff Parisi - who played Minty in EastEnders.</p>
      <p>But the pair were thrown right in at the deep end with a Bushtucker trial before they could meet campmates.</p>
      <p>They arrived in Snake Rock which had been transformed into a Jungle jail.</p>
      <p>It was extremely basic with ground sheets on the floor.</p>

      <p>"Me and Cliff walked in and it was very basic. I've probably stayed in better hostels," Andy joked.</p>
      <p>And in response, Cliff said: "I'm on the floor.</p>
      <p>"I've only just got into the Jungle and I mean there's creepy crawlies and stuff and I've just had to deal with that and now I'm going to have to deal with them all night," he explained, referring to his new sleeping arrangements.</p>
      <p>They swept the groundsheets in an attempt to make the camp more habitable.</p>
      <p>Andy and Cliff were delighted that they had managed to find eight stars. </p>
      <p>"I think the camp will eat well so hopefully they'll like us for that," hopeful actor Andy said.</p>
