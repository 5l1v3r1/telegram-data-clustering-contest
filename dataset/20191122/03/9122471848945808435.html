      <h1>Nick Saban Reveals Plan For Taulia Tagovailoa After Brother’s Injury</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T03:14:29+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 03:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Tua’s season might be done, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be a Tagovailoa taking snaps for Alabama this weekend. Younger brother Taulia Tagovailoa is now the Crimson Tide’s backup quarterback.</p>
      <p>A true freshman, Taulia has played in four games so far this season. Originally, the plan was for him to appear in no more than four contests so he could retain a redshirt year under the NCAA’s new rule.</p>
      <p>Not anymore. With backup Mac Jones now the starter, Taulia is one snap away from having to be “the” guy. Tonight, <a href="https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/alabama-football/nick-saban-shares-how-alabama-will-handle-taulia-tagovailoas-playing-time/">Nick Saban revealed</a> he intends to play his new second-stringer this weekend, officially burning his redshirt.</p>
      <p>Here’s <a href="https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1MnxnEgEYYEJO">what Saban had to say</a> on his weekly radio show, <a href="https://www.al.com/alabamafootball/2019/11/alabama-no-longer-plans-to-redshirt-taulia-tagovailoa.html">via AL.com</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“We’re gonna play him this week in this game some kind of way regardless of how the game goes to try to get him some experience, some playing time and hopefully some confidence,” head coach Nick Saban said. “When we had the unfortunate injury last week to Tua, that kind of negated the opportunity to be able tor redshirt to Taulia.”<br/><br/>[ .. ]<br/><br/>“With him being now the backup quarterback, we thought we needed to play him,” Saban said, “because if something happens to this quarterback, Mac Jones, he’s going to be the guy that’s got to go in the game and try to win the game for us.”</blockquote>
      <p>Taulia Tagovailoa is 7-of-9 passing for 65 yards this season. He saw his most extended action against Arkansas, completing 6-of-8 attempts for 45 yards.</p>
      <p>Alabama hosts Western Carolina and will close out the regular season against Auburn on November 30.</p>
      <p>Rated fifth in the most recent College Football Playoff rankings, Alabama likely has no opportunity to win the SEC title. Therefore, they will be at the mercy of the committee when it comes time to select the four-team field.</p>
