      <p>After he made his shocking appearance on WWE Backstage last week, CM Punk appeared on the show as a special contributor and analyst on this week's edition. The Straight Edge Superstar gave his opinion on Seth Rollins' challenge, and the blue Universal title, among other things.</p>

      <p>Steve Austin <a href="https://wrestlingnews.co/wwe-news/steve-austin-gives-his-thoughts-on-cm-punk-working-on-wwe-backstage">discussed </a>Punk's return and shared his views on Punk working for the FS1 show. Austin isn't sure whether this is going to lead to an in-ring return, but he loves the fact that Punk is finally back after splitting with WWE on bad terms.</p>
      <blockquote>"I don’t know if it leads to anything more, I guess speculation, to be determined, we’ll find out. Just the fact that he’s returned to be doing business with WWE, I love, because I don’t know, they split up on bad terms, and now they’re back in business together.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"It’s a breath of fresh air because the guy brings a great perspective, great insight, and great opinion on all things sports entertainment.”</blockquote>
