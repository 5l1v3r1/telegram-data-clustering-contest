      <h1>Apple Quietly Removes Customer Ratings And Reviews From Its Online Store</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T03:41:22+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 03:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/heirul/" target="_blank">Heirul Kamel</a></address>
      <p>Customer ratings and reviews were quietly removed from Apple’s online store sometime around 17 November. Prior to this, you’ll be able to locate “Ratings &amp; Reviews” after the “Compatibility” section in an Apple product page, but now it has been removed entirely.</p>
      <p>According to AppleInsider, the customer review section was removed from the United States, United Kingdom, and Australian Apple online stores, which suggests that it was an intentional decision made by the company. We’ve also checked the Malaysian online store and can confirm that the section has been removed as well.</p>
      <p>By using Wayback Machine for reference, you’ll be able to notice that “Reviews &amp; Ratings” section was still present in the archived 16 November <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191116152732/https://www.apple.com/my/shop/product/MK0C2ZA/A/apple-pencil-1st-generation">Apple Pencil page</a> on the Malaysian Apple online store, while it is no longer to be found if you refer to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/my/shop/product/MK0C2ZA/A/apple-pencil-1st-generation">same page</a> (screenshot also provided below) at this current time.</p>

      <p>Previously, Apple had been known for keeping negative customer reviews and ratings on all of its product pages, which reflects on transparency and integrity to its users. With no announcements made, Apple has not disclosed any information as to why the section was removed.</p>
      <p>That said, it’s currently unknown if the removal of customer reviews and ratings is temporary or a permanent change to its online store, at least until Apple actually releases a statement regarding this.</p>
