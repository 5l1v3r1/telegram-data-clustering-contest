      <p>WWE Survivor Series is already an event that's caused a great deal of buzz with RAW, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/smackdown">SmackDown</a> and NXT at war in the battle for brand supremacy. While we have seen a great number of surprises already, I do believe that there will be a lot more, as the event draws nearer.</p>
      <p>In this article, I will illustrate 5 possible surprises that we could see at the show. Please let me know if you agree or disagree with me in the comments below and be sure to add your own surprises to the list as well because we at Sportskeeda Wrestling are always all ears for what you guys have to say.</p>

      <p>With that said, here are 5 surprises that could happen at <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">Survivor Series</a> this year...</p>

      <p>It is very clear that Seth Rollins is gunning for a match against CM Punk, possibly at WrestleMania 36. If that were to happen, I'm almost certain that Seth Rollins will have to turn heel but that's another story for another slide, I suppose. The most important thing that you have to remember is that Survivor Series this year is happening in Chicago, and CM stands for (among a million other terms) 'Chicago Made'.</p>
      <p>CM Punk does not have to get into the ring. He just needs to show up for the arena to explode and for Seth Rollins to be pinned by Team NXT or Team SmackDown in the middle of the ring. It would kick-start the hottest feud of the year and maybe, the decade!</p>
