      <h3>Ethereum Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In the weekly forecast, we discussed the chances of a breakdown in Ethereum if it trades below the $180 support against the US Dollar. ETH price did settle below the $180 support and 100 hourly simple moving average, resulting in a sharp decline.</p>
      <p>The price broke <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/21/ethereum-eth-medium-term-trend-turns-negative-bears-eye-160/">many supports near $172 and $166</a>. Moreover, it is down close to 8% today and it recently tested the $154-$155 support area (the final possible target for the bears this month).</p>
      <p>A new monthly low was formed near $156 and the price is currently correcting higher. It traded above the $160 level. Besides, there was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $177 high to $156 low.</p>
      <p>At the outset, there is a short term contracting triangle forming with resistance near $165 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Above the triangle resistance, the $166 level could also act as a strong hurdle for the bulls.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $177 high to $156 low is near the $166 level. Therefore, Ethereum price is likely to face a strong selling interest near the $165 and $166 levels.</p>
      <p>Once the current corrective wave is complete, the price might decline below $160. However, there are chances of ranging moves above the $155 support area for some time before the next major move.</p>
      <p>If there is a downside break below the $154-$155 support area, the chances of a decent recovery in the near term will most likely fade. The next key support is seen near the $142 level.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/">chart</a>, Ethereum price is clearly struggling below the $166 and $172 level. The current wave is likely to complete near $166 or $172 before the bears take back control. Only a close above $172 could decrease the current bearish pressure.</p>
