      <p>Statik Selektah has made albums with Termanology, Kxng Crooked, Bun B, and Bumpy Knuckles, just to name a few. One of the busiest producers/DJs/radio hosts in Hip-Hop has just announced another collaborative project—arguably with an unlikely partner. On November 28, Statik and Houston, Texas veteran Paul Wall are releasing <i>Give Thanks</i>. The LP involves Termanology, NEMS, and Pro Era member CJ Fly.</p>
      <p><i>Give Thanks</i> also features Benny The Butcher. Lead single “Overcame” shows the depth in the former Swishahouse MC’s bars, alongside one of Griselda’s sharp lyricists. Statik hooks up a beat that extracts some street sounds out of a Gospel record. Rooted in that early 2000s Kanye West and Heatmakerz vibe (with some ShowOff drums), the chorus is about overcoming the odds.</p>

      </p>
      <p>That sentiment is echoed by the two MCs. “<i>I used to think dope was my calling, that’s small business / Now I might open up a grocery store, and put jobs in it / If y’all ni**as wanna be popular, that’s y’all business / ‘Cause the Feds puttin’ all the big names in small prisons / What you know about them traps and them stoves? / Them halves and them wholes? / Young ni**as catch what I throw ’em, like Patrick Mahomes / A ni**a really dapped it with Cole and patched in with Hov / I left my house young, and came back with the throne,</i>” raps the artist who participated in the Grammy-nominated Dreamville sessions and inked a management deal with Roc Nation. The Buffalo native turned a life outside the law into a place among the best rappers of 2019.</p>

      <p>Paul Wall plays cleanup on his song. “<i>They say everything happens for a purpose / But 30 years is quite extreme for just a purchase,</i>” he begins, referring to unfair drug laws. “<i>Look, it gotta rain before you can see where all the leaks are at / Loyalty’s a rare trait, can we speak to that? / Tweet the facts, he too busy try’na tweak the stats / Where speakin’ back will get ya stomped like feet-to-mat,</i>” raps the MC. The song is a fine showing for all three artists.</p>
