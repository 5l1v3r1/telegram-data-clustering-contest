      <p>The Esperance Community Arts team has been busy planning for upcoming community projects with a range of partner organisations - including two new murals, the 2020 Esperance Wildflower Festival, the One and All Community Program, the Edge of the Bay event, and the Christmas Pageant.</p>
      <p>We have continued our Be Connected Tea &amp; Technology program for people over 55, our Act-Belong-Commit Art for Mindfulness workshops and exhibition, and our Act-Belong-Commit Kaddatji Nyungar Boodja Plants and Culture sessions in partnership with Esperance Tjlatjraak Native Title Aboriginal Corporation and Esperance Wildflower Society.</p>

      <p>The Senior Citizens Centre hosted Meredith Waters from the Esperance Drumming Group with 12 people trying out the Djembe drums, many for the first time.</p>
      <p>The Hobby Painters group presented an exhibition; and took part in soap-making workshop.</p>
      <p>One hundred people took up the opportunity of a $5 movie, thanks to the generosity of the Seniors Recreation Council Esperance Branch.</p>
      <p>The Seniors Preview of Robin Hood and the Babes in the Wood received very positive responses. Morning Melodies at the Esperance Civic Centre on Thursday was the perfect way to end a week.</p>
