      <h1>Naseem Shah deprived of maiden Test wicket after no ball check gives David Warner second chance</h1>
      <h2>Naseem Shah had bowled a couple of no balls early in the day. The wicket-taking delivery was a clear no-ball, unlike the one Pat Cummins bowled to get Mohammad Rizwan's wicket on Day 1 which led to a big controversy.</h2>

      <p>Naseem Shah almost got rewarded for sweating it out in the Brisbane sun but overstepping the line proved costly for him and the team. Shah got the wicket of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/david-warner/">David Warner</a> forcing him to play a delivery away from his body leading to an outside edge on Day 2 of the first Test on Friday. The Pakistan side were celebrating and congratulating the 16-year-old for his debut Test wicket and a crucial breakthrough but the decision was reversed soon enough as it was a no-ball.</p>

      <p>Warner got a second life in the 27th over of Australia’s first innings. The Australian opener was batting on 56 when it happened.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Shah bowled with good rhythm with his speed clocking in high 140s. He got hit for a few boundaries by Warner but caused few problems with short-pitched deliveries bowling round the wicket.</p>

      <p>On Thursday, Shah played his debut Test innings scoring seven runs from 12 balls including a boundary off Mitchell Starc.</p>
      <p>Naseem Shah got emotional when he got his Test cap from Pakistan’s bowling coach Waqar Younis. Shah had lost his mother during the tour but chose not to fly home after consulting his family.</p>
