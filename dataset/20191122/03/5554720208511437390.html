      <p>Bollywood megastar and the host of Sony TV’s quiz show<i> Kaun Banega Crorepati,</i> Amitabh Bachchan, on Thursday showered praises on Kangana Ranaut by calling her the number one actress of the film industry. Kangana, who has been in the news for taking on Karan Johar accusing him of promoting nepotism, featured on KBC as Bachchan asked one of his contestants to identify the voice of an actress. Bachchan’s daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai too has been a leading actress of the film industry for several years.</p>

      <p>Bachchan asked, “Which actress’s voice is this?” The options were Ameesha Patel, Kangana Ranaut, Preity Zinta and Kriti Sanon. The correct answer was Kangana Ranaut, who was heard saying in the audio, “I’ve received offers from so many parties. Even my grandfather was a big politician. But I have willingly not accepted (those offers) because I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to be a politician. I want to be a filmmaker. And that’s my primary goal right now.”</p>
      <p>Bachchan later said, “Kangana Ranaut ji is a very beautiful, number one and famous artist. She has won many awards including National Awards and Filmfare Awards.”</p>

      <p>The KBC show on Thursday night also saw Bachchan welcome a contestant from West Bengal’s Malda district. As expected, the contestant struggled to speak Hindi properly while getting the gender horribly wrong. Bachchan comforted her by reminding her that he was married to a Bengali himself and knew about Bengalis’ struggle with Hindi. He said, “You don’t worry. I have a special relationship with Bengal, you must be aware. So, you rest assured. I accept the way you speak.”</p>
      <p>Earlier, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan had featured on several occasions during this season of KBC. On one occasion, a contestant had praised the eyes of Bachchan’s daughter-in-law prompting the Bollywood megastar to complain why the contestant was not praising his eyes.</p>
