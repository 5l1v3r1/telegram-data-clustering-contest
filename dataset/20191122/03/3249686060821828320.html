We began filming in early summer and wrapped up when we could feel the first signs of winter. I learned so much during that time, and felt that I should work harder as an actress. I feel that I will always think of this production whenever summer rolls around again. Thank you to the viewers who loved 'Extraordinary You' and Dan Oh."</i></p>

      <p>Additionally, through his label <b>FNC Entertainment</b>, Rowoon commented, <i>"</i><i>When I first started filming, I was very anxious and not very confident in myself, because the character was difficult. However, as the episodes went on, I was so happy to see myself acting and speaking more like Haru. I began to dress, talk, and act like Haru, reading the script like Haru, and he began to form concrete shape. It was a production where I put in so much effort to become the real Haru. I'm thankful that viewers saw this effort kindly... I hope that this drama will linger as a lasting impression in the hearts of viewers, as much as it will linger with me. I was so happy to live as Haru, and thank you so much to those who loved him." </i></p>
