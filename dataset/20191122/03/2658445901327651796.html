      <h3>John Ofikhenua, Abuja</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>TO achieve increased oil production with a cordial relationship, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva on Thursday urged local and International Oil Companies (IOCs) to take to Corporate Social Responsibility (CRS)- give back to the communities they operate.</p>
      <p>He made the call at the  grand finale of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, (NNPC) 2019 National Quiz Competition.</p>
      <p>According to him,  it had become crucial that oil and gas companies build a sustainable and harmonious relationship with their host communities, as this is critical to increased crude oil production.</p>
      <p>His words: “In the oil and gas industry, giving back to the communities is imperative to get the support of the local community and guarantee smooth exploration and production activities.</p>
      <p>“Giving the degradation of the environment usually occasioned by exploration and production activities in the oil and gas industries, oil and gas companies across the country are duty-bound to alleviate the impact of the exploitation on their respective communities.</p>
      <p>“I note the various CSR activities being undertaken by many other companies across the Niger Delta. My position, however, is that their respective efforts can never be too much in order to bring relief to the people.”</p>

      <p>He noted that these experts would be expected to churn out innovative solutions and drive Nigeria’s quest towards industrialization and global competitiveness.</p>
      <p>He said, “As the world moves ever increasingly into the period of the fourth industrial revolution, we in emerging economies would need scientists and technicians who can think outside of the box in the quest to find solutions to our unique challenges.</p>
      <p>“This ability of intellect is part of the skills that these young people in this competition have honed over the period of the competition.”</p>
      <p>At the grand finale of the quiz competition, where 18 states were represented, Master Ojo Oluwatobi Samuel, of Apt Scholars Universal College, Ota, representing Ogun State, emerged the winner; while Mbazu Justice Chinoso of CSMT Staff Secondary School, Abakaliki, representing Ebonyi State, came second.</p>
