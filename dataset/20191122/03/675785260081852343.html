      <h2>WARNING, DISGUSTING CONTENT: Pimple popping enthusiasts were delighted by the video after it was shared on Instagram - although some suggested the woman visit her doctor</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T03:33:51+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 03:33</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>A woman burst a huge cyst in a disgusting video shared online.</p>
      <p>In the footage she can be seen squeezing a thick stream of puss out of the spot.</p>
      <p>The growth under her armpit explodes after she pinches it while holding a tissue.</p>
      <p>The clip was uploaded to the Pimple Popping Videos <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> page.</p>
      <p>Some compared the spot to a cow's udder, while others demanded to see a longer version of the video.</p>
      <p>Queenbeee666 said 'where’s the rest of this vid', while Mikedillon64 added 'there needs to be a part two to this one!'</p>

      <p>Others reiterated that the woman needed to see a doctor.</p>
      <p>Blackheads, cysts, boils and zits aren’t the first things that come to mind when thinking about what’s popular on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/youtube">YouTube</a> .</p>
      <p>But there is an entire sub-genre dedicated to the science of skin extractions – and they aren’t being made by professional vloggers.</p>
      <p>Dr Sandra Lee, known as 'Dr Pimple Popper', is an American <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dr-pimple-popper">dermatologist</a> working in California.</p>

      <p>She started uploading videos of her practise on YouTube in 2010 but began amassing a large following after posting her first skin extraction video in 2014.</p>
      <p>With her patients’ written permission she continued to post videos of her treatment and she now posts several videos on her channel a week.</p>
      <p>Her regular videos became so well known that she was even offered her own reality TV show on TLC in 2018 which followed her patient’s lives before and after treatment.</p>

      <p>Many of the participants on the show have severe skin conditions and the results are often life changing experiences for them.</p>
      <p>Dr Abigail Cline explained why some people receive satisfaction from watching other people self-extract.</p>
      <p>“Others might enjoy the grotesque aspect of extractions and feel a bit of bizarre fascination when they see the outburst of pus.”</p>
      <p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/07/20/the-grossest-show-on-tv-stars-a-dermatologist-known-as-dr-pimple-popper-heres-why-people-like-it/">Washington Post</a> , Heather Berlin, a neuroscientist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York said, "evolutionarily speaking, it's normal behaviour to want to remove bumps from your skin.”</p>
