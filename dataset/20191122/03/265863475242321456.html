      <h1>Fetty Wap And His Wife Leandra Gonzalez Are Getting Divorced Already</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T03:12:54+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 03:12</time> by <a rel="author">Todd Malm</a></address>
      <p>According to a report from BET.com, Fetty Wap’s new wife, whom he married four months ago, Leandra Gonzalez, is already looking to get a divorce. It was reported earlier this week that Masika Kalysha, the reality star, was furious that the singer/rapper brought their daughter, Khari Barbie, around Fetty’s new wife.</p>
      <p>The “1738” singer married the Instagram model back in August. Earlier this week, it was reported by multiple outlets that Masika took to her Instagram to say, “tell the wh*re you called a mistake, I’m not the f*cking one to play with!”</p>
      <p>The Love and Hip-Hop alum went on to say she would go to “jail or h*ll” in defense of the right thing for her child. Masika claimed in her post that Fetty Wap once told her she would never have their child around random women.</p>
      <p>Reportedly, the feud between Fetty Wap, Masika Kalysha, and Leandra intensified when Leandra posted a photo of Khari to her Instagram Story. Afterward, when a fan asked the IG model about what happened, she responded by stating they were in the process of separating already.</p>

      <p>Masika is a “whole groupie,” one fan wrote, stating that no dude she has ever claimed to have, said the same of her in return. The anonymous commenter went on to argue that she was his wife, and Masika had no choice but to deal with it.</p>
      <p>In response to the fan, Leandra clarified that she and Fetty Wap were technically married, legally, but they weren’t actually in a relationship. She added that she didn’t know anything about Kalysha, and didn’t pass judgment on anyone.</p>
      <p>Reported earlier this year by multiple outlets, Fetty Wap and the IG model got married back in October of 2019. Coincidentally, they had already got married already in Toronto, which was Leandra’s hometown, during the summer months.</p>
      <p>Currently, Fetty Wap has 7 children. BET reported last year that the rapper admitted having more than half-a-dozen kids. Although, he flexed by stating he had 22 million in the bank as well.</p>
