      <p>In the campaign, dubbed; ‘auction to auction’, TCRA is working in collaboration with mobile phone network operators, police through cybercrime department, the National Identification Authority (NIDA) and immigration department.</p>
      <p>Head of TCRA in central zone, Anthony Mayanda said that since its commencement, the campaign has reached 18 regions in the country thus enabling people to recognise the importance of the biometric registration.</p>
      <p>According to him, the campaign is now in Singida Region educating and helping residents to register to get national ID as well as register their sim-cards biometrically.</p>
      <p>Mayanda said that the authority is well prepared to ensure that it reaches all owners of sim cards while capacitating them with essential communication education and addressing various challenges facing consumers.</p>
      <p>Mabel Masasi, TCRA senior communication officer said that the campaign also aims to strengthen communication services in the country.</p>
      <p>In May, this year, the government through Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA) directed all Subscriber Identification Module (Sim) cards to be biometrically registered by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>In March, TCRA launched a pilot project to register Sim cards using the technology in Zanzibar and in the regions of Dodoma, Dar es Salaam, Coast Region, Singida, Tanga and Iringa.</p>
      <p>According to the regulator, the move was meant to get rid of dishonest Sim card users and registration agents who have malicious intentions, including committing crimes.</p>
