      <p>He made the call shortly after he was conferred with an honorary doctorate degree (honoris causa) in recognition of his outstanding leadership at the University of Dodoma’s tenth graduation ceremony.</p>
      <p>UDOM Chancellor and former president Benjamin Mkapa conferred the degree on President Magufuli.</p>
      <p>President Magufuli urged academic and other research institutions to prioritize funding for research activities to ensure research agendas are locally driven.</p>
      <p>The Head of State was concerned that currently most researches are driven by donors.</p>
      <p>“Most of our research findings are driven by donors’ agenda because they are key financers.</p>
      <p>This is not good for the country,” he said, expressing dismay over the tendency of public entities not using research findings from local institutions.</p>
      <p>He said that the government has been relying on locally funded researches in implementing the ruling CCM 2015/2020 election manifesto.</p>
      <p>He cited the Tanzania Revenues Authority (TRA) as one of public institutions that had failed to utilize local technology, as an application developed by Ardhi University to increase revenue collections was left idle.</p>
      <p>Ardhi University developed an application which allows the taxman to trace the location of houses across the country, but it has not been utilized, despite that with the use of the tool, TRA could improve property tax collections.</p>
      <p>President Magufuli said he received the honorary degree on behalf of Tanzanians, including farmers, fishermen and livestock keepers who have in one way or the other contributed toward achievements made by his gpvernment.</p>
      <p>He commended previous governments led by presidents Julius Nyerere, Ali Hassan Mwinyi, Benjamin Mkapa and Jakaya Kikwete for the roles they played in transforming the country's economy.</p>
      <p>Dr Magufuli, who took office on November 5, 2015 listed a catalogue of measures that he took in order to boost revenue that was used to implement development projects.</p>
      <p>He explained the measures as closing loopholes in tax collection, suspending foreign travels by public servants, removing 20,000 ghost public workers and 14,000 public workers with inferior academic credentials, along with fighting corruption.</p>
      <p>The money saved from these measures was spent in providing free education, increasing higher education loans and improving education infrastructure like construction of classrooms and laboratories across the country.</p>
      <p>During his four-year tenure the government has implemented flagship projects including the Julius Nyerere hydropower project in the Rufiji basin, the standard gauge railway (SGR), port expansion, construction of road networks and purchase of planes leased to the country's airline.</p>
      <p>He said under his government over 4,000 new industrial units had come up as part of efforts toward making Tanzania a middle-income country by 2025.</p>
      <p>UDOM vice-chancellor Professor Faustine Bee said the university decided to confer the degree on President Magufuli in recognition of his efforts in improving the country's economy through his industrialization drive.</p>
      <p>Other recipients of the honorary degree conferred by UDOM include former President Jakaya Kikwete and former Prime Minister Rashid Kawawa (deceased) who were awarded in 2010 for their exceptional leadership.</p>
