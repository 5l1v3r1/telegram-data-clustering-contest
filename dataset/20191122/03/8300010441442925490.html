      <p>LEIMERT PARK, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- The gun that a 5-year-old boy found and fired at himself may have been legally owned by an adult in the household who worked as a security guard, according to a frequent visitor at the Leimert Park home.<br/><br/>The child died of a self-inflicted wound in what the Los Angeles Police Department is investigating as an unintentional shooting.<br/><br/>According to friends and family members, the 5-year-old named Justice was under county Department of Children and Family Services supervision, as were his four siblings.<br/><br/>All have lived at the home since they were babies because their birth mother was unable to care for them.<br/><br/>The children's guardian, a friend of the birth mother described as "the mother of the neighborhood," has been trying to adopt the children.<br/><br/>The guardian's boyfriend tells Eyewitness News that his adult son is a security guard who is licensed to carry a weapon. Malcom Burdette says that the gun had been stowed on a closet shelf and that detectives have interviewed him.<br/><br/>LAPD has not confirmed that the security guard's weapon was the one found by the boy.<br/><br/>"We're still putting pieces of the puzzle together, " said LAPD spokesman Josh Rubenstein.<br/><br/>The death comes as gun safety advocates have stepped up measures to inform adults about securing weapons to prevent deaths and injuries of children.<br/><br/>"It is so, so preventable. It is 100% preventable," says Loren Lieb with Women Against Gun Violence, which has pushed schools to get involved in a safety campaign.<br/><br/>The LAUSD school board responded. This year students were sent home with paperwork that explained gun storage laws and required a parent or guardian's confirmation that they read it.<br/><br/>City Attorney Mike Feuer has prosecuted 43 cases in which a gun owner failed to lock up a weapon.<br/><br/>The county Department of Children and Family Services says that a guardian may keep a gun in the household but it must be shown to be locked with the ammunition stored in a separate location.<br/><br/>Porsha Neal, whose 3-year old son played with Justice, fought tears as she tried to explain the death.<br/><br/>"It was just sad yesterday to see my son over here and I can't explain to my 3-year-old son that his buddy isn't here anymore."</p>
