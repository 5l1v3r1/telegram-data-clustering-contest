      <p>Members of Centre for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the public to investigate the fake police officers that overpowered the 66,241 personnel deployed in polling units during the governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states.</p>
      <p>Its Executive director, David Anyaele, claimed that there was a serious security challenge in most of the local government areas observed during the governorship elections.</p>
      <p>He lamented that money in politics particularly on Election Day had become a serious issue in Nigeria as votes were “usually bought.”</p>
      <p>Anyaele urged the government to deploy stratified security agents during polling in the country, so as to reduce electoral violence and to encourage even participation of citizens especially those with disabilities.</p>
      <p>He added that the prevailing issues of insecurity had hindered the PWDs from exercising franchise in some of the affected polling units.</p>
