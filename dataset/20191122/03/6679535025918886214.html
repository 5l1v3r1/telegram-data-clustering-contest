      <p>Three-month-old Prince Rajbhar, <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kem-hospital-fire-babys-arm-amputated-due-to-burn-injuries/article29948504.ece">who lost his arm in a fire</a> at KEM hospital’s Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, passed away at 2.45 a.m. on Friday. The baby went into cardiac arrest.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/baby-prince-critical-on-ventilator-support/article30031418.ece">He was critical</a> and on maximum ventilator support. His condition deteriorated on Thursday night”, said dean Hemant Deshmukh.</p>
      <p>Born in Mau district of Uttar Pradesh with a congenital heart disease, the baby was brought to Mumbai for better treatment. On November 7, an ECG cable caught fire, causing severe burn injuries to the baby, leading to the amputation of his left arm. While he was already serious, the burn injuries and amputation worsened his condition.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bmc-reluctant-to-pay-compensation/article30001726.ece">civic body had initially offered ₹5 lakh compensation</a> to the parents, which they refused. The amount was later increased to ₹10 lakh.</p>
