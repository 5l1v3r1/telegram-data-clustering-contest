      <p>For years, Betsy Braddock was trapped in the body of Kwannon, a mutant assassin. But in the Dawn of X, Betsy is the new Captain Britain while Kwannon is once again in her own body. Kwannon has also taken the name Psylocke for herself, even as she questions her place among the mutant nation of Krakoa. However, <b>Fallen Angels</b> has given Kwannon a new purpose in life.</p>
      <p>During the first issue of <b>Fallen Angels</b>, Psylocke received a vision about Apoth, a deadly new adversary. Apoth has already struck at Psylocke through her long-lost daughter. But now, Psylocke has some backup: X-23 and Cable. Even Sinister is backing these Fallen Angels. However, Sinister has yet to disclose the full price of his allegiance.</p>
      <p>In Superhero Hype’s exclusive preview from <b>Fallen Angels</b> #2, writer Bryan Michael Hill and artist Szymon Kudranski prepare the new team for battle. Along the way, X-23 makes a personal request from Psylocke. As for Cable, he may have come across new intel about Apoth’s designer drug.</p>
