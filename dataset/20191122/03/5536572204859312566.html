      <h1>Adam Schefter Explains Why The Los Angeles Chargers Should Move To Mexico (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>The Los Angeles Chargers are in their third season playing in the Los Angeles area and they still haven’t found a fan base to come out and fill every seat at a soccer stadium. They are currently the only team in the league that plays 16 away games as opposing fans come in and take over every home game.</p>
      <p>The Chargers do not belong in Los Angeles, but one NFL insider believes he knows just the place they can go.</p>
      <p>This past Monday night, the Chargers took on the Kansas City Chiefs in Mexico City and it was shocking to see how many Chargers supports were in attendance out of the states compared to how many we actually see in the states.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Adam Schefter also noticed this, so he took to ‘Get Up’ on Thursday and explained why the Chargers need to move to Mexico City.</p>

      <p>I think all of Los Angeles would be just fine with this. Move back to San Diego or go to Mexico.</p>
