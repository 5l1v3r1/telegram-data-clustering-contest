      <p><b>New Delhi</b><b>:</b> The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear a plea seeking identification and deportation of all illegal immigrants from the country, including of Bangladeshi nationals and Rohingyas.</p>
      <p>BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay made the plea before a bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde, stating that the matter is very crucial and the court should hear it.</p>
      <p>“The illegal Rohingya and Bangladeshi immigrants are actually taking away the bread and butter of many citizens in the country” Upadhyay submitted before the bench.</p>
      <p>After his brief submission, the court listed for hearing after four weeks.</p>
      <p>“List it for hearing after four weeks,” said the bench, which also included Justices Surya Kant and Sanjiv Khanna.</p>
      <p>The plea said that a large influx of illegal migrants, particularly from Myanmar and Bangladesh, is a matter of concern, which has threatened the demographic structure of bordering districts. The illegal migration has also seriously impaired security and national integration, and they can be viewed as a potential threat.</p>
      <p>In his plea, Upadhyaya has supported the Centre’s stand to screen and deport 40,000 illegal Rohingya Muslim, who have sought shelter India, to Myanmar.</p>
      <p>The plea seeks directions to Centre and state governments to identify, detain and deport all illegal immigrants and infiltrators.</p>
      <p>The plea alleged that large-scale movement of immigrants from Myanmar into the country is a nexus involving agents and touts who facilitate Rohingyas’ entry.</p>
      <p>The points of illegal entry into India are through Benapole-Haridaspur and Hilli (West Bengal), Sonamora (Tripura), Kolkata and Guwahati which has created a very serious situation, the plea submitted. (IANS)</p>
