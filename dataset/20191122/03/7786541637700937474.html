      <p>Vernitta Love, who served in the Air Force and Air Force Reserve for 25 years was nominated by her son, Aaron Love for <a href="https://corporate.homedepot.com/foundation">the Home Depot Foundation</a>'s Operation Surprise, according to Home Depot Foundation spokeswoman Morgan Salmon. </p>
      <p>"My mom is retired and she is always helping other veterans and homeless vets that are in need, often when she needs help herself," Aaron Love <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local/marietta-veteran-gets-50k-for-home-repairs-from-home-depot-foundation/aHmUA3gw1i3uJ9j9vT8A4K/">said</a>. "Her house is a home but behind the scenes, it's a wreck."</p>
      <p>Operation Surprise was a contest in which people could nominate a veteran they thought was deserving of a $25,000 grant for home repairs, Salmon <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local/marietta-veteran-gets-50k-for-home-repairs-from-home-depot-foundation/aHmUA3gw1i3uJ9j9vT8A4K/">said</a>. Love was chosen from 2,516 nominations. </p>
      <p>Love, who was clearly emotional after receiving the news, was also told during the show the grant was doubled to $50,000. </p>

      <p>"She is a patriot to our family and the community. We love her," her son <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local/marietta-veteran-gets-50k-for-home-repairs-from-home-depot-foundation/aHmUA3gw1i3uJ9j9vT8A4K/">said</a>. </p>
