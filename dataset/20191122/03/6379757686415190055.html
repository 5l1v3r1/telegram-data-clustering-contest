      <p>He gave the directives yesterday in Igunga District when speaking to farmers cultivating various crops including cotton accompanied by extension officers from district councils in Tabora Region.</p>
      <p>Mwanri said basically leaves are public servants right, but he has to issue a caution because farmers activities depend on directives from them for a more productive farming.</p>
      <p>"The rains have started and already farmers have started cultivation…you have to go to them to educate them on better farming techniques…and it is forbidden for an extension officer to travel outside his work station, unless it is an emergency,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said if farmers cannot be assisted they will continue to use poor, old fashioned farming methods and end up farming for subsistence instead of boosting crop production for raw materials for the envisaged industrial development.</p>
      <p>He said during the rainy season, an extension officer is the same as a teacher during class – he also cannot go on leave when schools are not yet closed.</p>
      <p>He said soon after farming activities end the officials will be allowed to take their leaves.</p>
