      <p><b>BRISBANE, Australia —</b> Pakistan were left to rue a basic error from 16-year-old debutant Naseem Shah as Australia opener David Warner plundered the visitors' attack with a brilliant 151 not out on the second day of the first Test at the Gabba on Friday.<br/><br/>Australia finished the day on 312 for the loss of just one wicket, 72 runs ahead of Pakistan's first innings total of 240 and already in the driving seat.<br/><br/>Marnus Labuschagne was alongside Warner on 55, with the only wicket to fall that of Joe Burns, who made 97 before sweeping a Yasir Shah (1-101) delivery onto his stumps.<br/><br/>Warner scored his first Test century since a year-long ban for ball-tampering, but only after a huge let-off when he was caught behind off a Naseem no-ball.<br/><br/>The mercurial opener was on 56 at the time, and he then survived a near run-out on 93 before ending a century drought stretching back nearly two years.<br/><br/>The 33-year-old, who managed just 95 runs in 10 innings during this year's Ashes series against England, reached his 22nd Test ton when he turned Yasir around the corner for a single in the second over after tea.<br/><br/>Before the Ashes, he spent a year in the wilderness over the ball-tampering scandal and there were questions as to whether his days as an automatic choice at the top of the order were over.<br/><br/>However, in home conditions and against an attack that struggled for sideways movement, Warner was in imperious form as he brought up his fourth Test century at the Gabba.<br/><br/>"For me it's about going out there and backing my ability," he said, insisting he never felt any pressure about his place in the side.<br/><br/>"At the end of the day you get selected or you don't get selected and you've just got to accept that."<br/><br/>In the second last over of the day, Warner had another close shave when he was beaten by an Imran Khan delivery that brushed the off stump without disturbing the bails.<br/><br/>"Today I was on the receiving end of a bit of luck, which is what you need in a game — over there (in England) I didn't get any luck at all," he said.<br/><br/>Naseem looked impressive on debut and regularly bowled at over 145 kilometers (90 miles) per hour, but he was guilty of overstepping the mark on a number of occasions, despite not being called by the umpire.<br/><br/>In the second over after lunch, he enticed an expansive drive from Warner, who nicked the ball to wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan.<br/><br/>But Warner had barely left the crease when he was called back after TV umpire Michael Gough picked up that Naseem had again misplaced his front foot.<br/><br/>Naseem looked like he belonged on the big stage with a number of bristling spells before leaving the field late in the day with an apparent leg injury.<br/><br/>"He won't get a harder Test debut, bowling at the Gabba," Warner said.<br/><br/>"He kept his speed up the whole day — he charged in all day, there's a (future) superstar there."<br/><br/>The lack of movement meant Warner and Burns were able to play Naseem with relative ease, although he smashed Burns on the elbow two balls before the lunch break.<br/><br/><b>Scoreboard<br/><br/>Pakistan 1st innings</b> 240<br/><br/><b>Australia 1st innings</b><br/><br/>David Warner not out 151<br/><br/>Joe Burns b Yasir 97<br/><br/>Marnus Labuschagne not out 55<br/><br/>Extras (b2, lb4, nb3) 9<br/><br/>Total (for 1 wicket, 87 overs) 312<br/><br/>Fall of wickets: 1-222 (Burns)<br/><br/>To bat: Steve Smith, Travis Head, Matthew Wade, Tim Paine, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Josh Hazlewood<br/><br/>Bowling: Afridi 18-5-44-0 (2nb), Khan 12-1-43-0, Naseem 16-0-65-0 (1nb), Iftikhar 6-0-26-0, Yasir 28-1-101-1, Sohail 7-0-27-0. — AFP</p>
