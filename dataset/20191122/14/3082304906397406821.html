        <b>Inter have made a good start under Antonio Conte, who admitted he has given advise to his players on how to have sex during the season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Antonio Conte has revealed he advises his Inter players on how to have sex during the football season in order to maximise their on-field performance.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old, who won the Premier League title with Chelsea in 2017 and three Serie A titles with Juventus, took over as Inter boss in May.</p>
      <p>Inter have made an impressive start to the campaign, winning 10 of their opening 12 league matches to leave themselves a point adrift of leaders Juventus.</p>
      <p>A part of their success could be down to the bizarre off-field demands of Conte, the Italian coach admitting he urges his players not to over-exert themselves in the bedroom.</p>
      <p>“During the season, I advise my players to have sex for short periods and with the minimum of effort,” he told L’Equipe.</p>

      <p>“And preferably with their wives, because if with others, well, that needs extra action.”</p>
      <p>Inter are back in action on Saturday after a two-week break with a trip to Torino, who ended a six-game winless run last time out.</p>
      <p>Conte confirmed at Friday’s pre-match news conference that Stefano Sensi, Roberto Gagliardini and Kwadwo Asamoah are still injured, but Danilo D’Ambrosio is back in contention.</p>
      <p>“When there is a break it is difficult to prepare for games,” he told reporters. “Yesterday I welcomed back all the players who were away with their national teams.</p>
      <p>“Sensi, Gagliardini and Asamoah are unavailable. Sensi missed last month and has had a few problems. We are trying to get him back to his best condition so that he can help the group when back.</p>

      <p>“D’Ambrosio has recovered and must now get back to his best. He is a very versatile player, a joker in the pack that can be used in the centre and out wide. It’s very important to have players like him to count on.”</p>
      <p>Lukaku is expected to lead the line for Inter in Turin and Conte is happy with the Belgium international, despite him firing blanks in back-to-back games before the two-week break.</p>
      <p>“He is very important to us, as is Lautaro [Martinez],” Conte added. “Both players are doing very well – there is little else more to say.</p>
      <p>“They are both doing great work for the team and I am very happy. I hope they can continue in the same way.”</p>
