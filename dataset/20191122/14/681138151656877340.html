        <b>A man has been jailed for eight years for a rape he committed in 2016 after the victim decided to pursue a prosecution two years later.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rhys Street, 28, was found guilty on Monday November 18 at Chelmsford Crown Court of raping a young woman in her 20s after pretending to take care of her when she fell unwell.</p>
      <p>Street, of Rembrandt Way in Colchester, had denied rape, sexual assault and two counts of assault by penetration.</p>
      <p>His Honour Judge Turner told Street his conduct was inexcusable: "You took shameful disadvantage of this girl.</p>
      <p>"More importantly, you took advantage when she was plainly unwell, you did so nauseatingly under the impression of looking after her.</p>
      <p>"Rape is a grave offence, it's difficult to think of a more distressing assault.</p>
      <p>"This sort of offence frequently leaves a destructive psychology legacy that will haunt someone for years to come."</p>
      <p>As well as his eight year sentence, Street was put on the sex offenders register for life.</p>
      <p>Essex Police did not reveal details of the offence but investigating officer Detective Constable Kelly Blackwell said: "This was a disgusting assault where Street used this woman's clear vulnerability to his advantage of her.</p>
      <p>"The victim was brave enough to contact us and make a report, but, at the time, didn't wish to progress the investigation any further.</p>
      <p>"We gathered the necessary evidence so that when, and if, she felt ready, we were able to take action against the perpetrator.</p>
      <p>"Two years on and having made the decision to support a prosecution, we began criminal proceedings against Street.</p>
      <p>"Thanks to this woman's bravery, she has not only helped to put Street behind bars but also ensured that he will be a registered sex offender for life, helping to protect other potential victims."</p>
