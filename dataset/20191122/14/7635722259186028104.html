      <h1>RTÉ staff call on management to slash "indefensible" salaries</h1>

        <b>A number of RTÉ staff members have called on the State broadcaster to cut the salaries of its top presenters and managers immediately.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Members of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) working there have called on management to slash fees and salaries.</p>
      <p>It is part of a resolution backed overwhelming at an on-campus NUJ meeting held on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Journalists at the organisation said current levels were now "indefensible".</p>
      <p>The resolution said: "The RTÉ sub-branch notes the gravity of the current financial crisis that has enveloped the organisation.</p>
      <p>"It notes that RTÉ has referred to the crisis as an 'existential' one, and it accepts this description.</p>
      <p>"In light of the existential nature of this crisis we believe that it is now more than ever indefensible that RTÉ continues to pay exorbitant salaries of up to close to half a million euro to a small number of people in this organisation.</p>
      <p>"We understand the public anger at this and believe that that anger is justified."</p>
      <h3>Public sector pay reform</h3>
      <p>It also said that the Netherlands has introduced a law that prohibits anyone working in the public or semi-public sector from earning more than €187,000.</p>
      <p>This is done by pegging all top salaries to that of the country's prime minister.</p>
      <p>This measure, which includes those working at the Dutch public broadcaster, was introduced as a result of growing social outrage at high salaries.</p>
      <p>The NUJ members say: "We believe that the RTÉ proposal to cut 15% off payments to its top contracted presenters does not go far enough.</p>
      <p>"We are calling on RTÉ management to immediately move to reduce the fees of the top presenters so that no one in the organisation is earning more than the top civil service salary, that of Secretary-General.</p>
      <blockquote>"We believe this would be an important first step towards addressing the valid concerns felt by the public who we serve."</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier this month,<b> <a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/rte-cut-200-jobs-close-operations-part-cost-cutting-922368">the broadcaster announced</a></b> plans to cut some 200 jobs as part of plans to reduce projected costs by €60m over three years.</p>
      <p>It is also to close or sell a number of assets.</p>
      <p>The<i> RTÉ Guide</i> is to be sold while it will also shut its current studio in Limerick in 2020.</p>
      <p>Production of RTÉ Lyric FM will be moved to Cork and Dublin.</p>
      <p>The broadcaster is also closing its digital radio stations - such as 2XM, RTÉ Pulse and RTÉ Gold.</p>
      <p>While the teletext service RTÉ Aertel is also ceasing operation.</p>
      <p>Following the announcement, <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/rte-unions-warning-923340">trade unions warned</a></b> they will ballot members for industrial action if the broadcaster tries to force pay cuts and mandatory redundancies on staff.</p>
      <p>Graham Macken, industrial official with SIPTU, suggested striking remains an option - but they are still talking with management about the proposed changes.</p>
      <p>He said: "There's a lot of negotiations and discussions to take place between now and then.</p>
      <p>"To be very, very clear: we have stated that in the event that RTÉ attempt to impose pay cuts... we certainly at this point can't rule out a ballot of industrial action."</p>
