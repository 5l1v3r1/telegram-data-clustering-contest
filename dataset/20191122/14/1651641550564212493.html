      <h1>Samsung Galaxy S11+ may still feature a radical design</h1>

      <p>We have heard recently from reliable leaker Ice Universe that the Samsung Galaxy S11 will feature a Note 10-like near borderless design, but <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-galaxy-s11-specifications-leaked-online-here-is-everything-that-you-need-to-know/">be otherwise relatively conventional</a>.</p>
      <p>This news is rather disappointing when other Asian OEMs are pushing the envelope with waterfall screens and under-screen cameras.</p>
      <p>Now <a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce">Ice Universe</a> has thrown us a bit of a rope, as he revealed the Samsung Galaxy S11+ will, in fact, have a different design to the S11.</p>

      <p>What this design will be is still unknown (though there have been rumours of <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-galaxy-one-s11-replacement-may-feature-a-4-sided-waterfall-screen/">waterfall screens</a> and under-screen cameras), but we hope this is the handset Samsung uses to show they can keep up with their Chinese competitors.</p>
