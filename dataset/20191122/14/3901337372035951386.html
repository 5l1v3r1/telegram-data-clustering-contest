      <p>Ronaldo was replaced by Paul Dybala in Juve's 1-0 win over AC Milan before the international break, and was not impressed, walking off the pitch and straight down the tunnel.</p>
      <p>Reports suggested that <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/messi-ronaldo-neymar-watch-1/frustrated-cristiano-ronaldo-storms-off-pitch-leaves-stadium-maurizio-sarri-responds/667218">he even left the stadium early</a> afterwards, but his manager Sarri has once again downplayed the incident.</p>
      <p>"There is no need for clarification with Cristiano," he said, as quoted by the club’s official Twitter account.</p>
      <p>"At certain times, the players must be left to recover and cool down."</p>

      <p>While both Sarri and Ronaldo claimed he was not 100% fit, the Portugal captain did play in both of his country's 2020 UEFA European Championship qualifiers in the latest international break, scoring four goals.</p>
      <p>The Bianconeri superstar missed just seven minutes of action in those two games, but the Italian tactician has revealed that the forward has returned to Turin with an injury niggle that will keep him sidelined for Saturday's clash against Atalanta.</p>
      <p>"The problem is that on Tuesday he told us that he is still not well," Sarri added.</p>
      <p>"The goal is to have him back for the UEFA Champions League."</p>
