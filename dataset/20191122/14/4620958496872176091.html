      <p>“Dripping with the blood of six million Jews,” is how a member of Richmond’s Jewish community describes Nazi memorabilia up for auction at Maynards in Richmond Saturday.</p>
      <p>The items should not be sold for profit, Michael Sachs, the past-president of Bayit Synagogue in Richmond, told the Richmond News.</p>
      <p>Rather they belong in a museum or educational institute where they can be displayed with the right context, he added.</p>
      <p>“(Maynards) should know better than to play in such a volatile part of history and allow someone to make a profit of it,” Sachs said. “These items are literally dripping with the blood of six million Jews – I know it sound extreme, but it’s true.”</p>
      <p>The auction is called the “Firearms &amp; Militaria Auction” and includes a large collection of guns as well as military paraphernalia from around the world, for example, a 19th century Japanese ivory-cased sworda Burmese silver/bone mounted dagger.</p>
      <p>But there are also several items in the online catalogue from Nazi Germany including a German Luftwaffe officer’s dagger, a German fireman’s helmet, a Second World War German flag and a brass wall plaque, all emblazoned with swastikas.</p>
      <p>Hugh Bulmer, vice-president with Maynards, however, said history can’t be swept under the rug and the stories around these items need to be kept alive.</p>
      <p>“It’s part of history,” he said, adding there are also British items and American items from the time of slavery.</p>
      <p>Condemnation was also widespread on Facebook from Richmond’s municipal and provincial politicians with the mayor, Malcolm Brodie, calling the auction “inappropriate in the City of Richmond for so many reasons.”</p>
      <p>Richmond-Queensborough MLA Jas Johal asked Maynards on Facebook to remove the Nazi material from the auction, saying that Maynards “must do better.” He added that “An auction that sells Nazi memorabilia is not acceptable in any community, never mind one as diverse and caring as Richmond.</p>
      <p>Coun. Chak Au said in his Facebook post that the sale of these items was “disgusting.”</p>
      <p>“I propose that the City contact the auctioneer and express our disapproval and demand it to be removed from the list of auction items,” Au said on Facebook.</p>
      <p>Sachs said that if even one item from Nazi Germany is sold in a legitimate auction, they will start popping up everywhere.</p>
      <p>However, Bulmer said the collectors who come to Maynard’s auction are collectors and dealers, both local and international, and they include people of all ages and ethnic groups including Jewish collectors.</p>
      <p>“We deal with people who are regular collectors of arms and armour,” Bulmer said. “There’s no thought that we had any right-wing interest here.”</p>
      <p>Bulmer said instead of getting rid of items from conflict, he wants the “the stories kept alive so people know what happened during these conflicts.”</p>
