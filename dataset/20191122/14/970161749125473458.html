      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> poked fun at his sobriety during last night’s I’m A Celebrity: Extra Camp after Emily Atack cracked a joke about going for a drink with newcomer Andy Whyment.</p>
      <p>Andy was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-new-campmates-andy-whyment-and-cliff-parisi-pose-with-aussie-wildlife-ahead-of-jungle-debut-11183275/">joined by fellow soap star and former EastEnders actor Cliff Parisi</a> last night and won us all over <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebrity-viewers-cant-stop-laughing-andrew-whyment-fangirls-show-like-im-watching-telly-11197987/">as a die hard superfan of the show.</a></p>

      <p>The presenter was famously absent from last year’s I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/29/holly-willoughby-is-confirmed-as-ant-mcpartlins-im-a-celebrity-replacement-7892130/">replaced by Holly Willoughby</a> after he was charged with drink-driving in March 2018.</p>
      <p>Ant subsequently pulled out of all TV duties for the remainder of the year.</p>
      <p>However, the 44-year-old is now even making light of the disaster live on air during the ITV2 spin-off show.</p>
      <p>When The Inbetweeners actress explained she’d love ‘to go for a pint’ with Andy, Ant reminded the 29-year-old that he can’t.</p>

      <p>Fans have been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/fans-loving-ant-mcpartlin-back-im-celebrity-miss-holly-willoughby-11172667/">delighted to have Ant and Dec back together</a> in the jungle, although ideally they’d love to see two become three and have Holly back on the series too after she not only made the perfect stand-in, the This Morning host actually boosted I’m A Celebrity viewing figures to record heights.</p>
      <p>But the real star of the series has to be Caitlyn Jenner, who has been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/im-a-celebrity-recap-caitlyn-jenner-learns-girls-aloud-dance-as-she-apologises-for-insulting-soap-stars-11196763/">leaning all the Girls Aloud dance moves</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-face-huge-fines-exposing-kardashian-family-secrets-11194080/">spilling the Kardashians tea</a> and even <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-apologises-throws-shade-soap-stars-andy-whyment-cliff-parisi-11198083/">having a pop at soap stars</a> when she’s currently living with three of them.</p>
