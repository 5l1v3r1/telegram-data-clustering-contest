      <h1>Alan Moore's Daughter Shares Heartfelt Explanation of His Superhero Aversion</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:11:24+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:11</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Cronin</a></address>
      <p>Leah Moore, a writer and the daughter of comic book icon, Alan Moore, took to Twitter on Thursday to defend her father against criticisms over <a href="https://screenrant.com/watchmen-writer-alan-moore-superhero-movie-opinion/">his current anti-superhero views</a>.</p>
      <p>Her father recently made an earnest plea for people to vote in next month's British General Election, but Moore believed that her father's message was derailed a bit by the discussion that has popped up in recent days about her father's superhero critiques (critiques that the writer actually made a few years ago, but blew up recently due to the recent Martin Scorsese controversy about superhero movies). So she wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/leahmoore/status/1197450019072356353">a beautiful tribute</a> about how her father's love for superhero has been ruined.</p>

      <p>Moore opened her tribute by noting that she does feel sad that her father doesn't get to enjoy modern comics that she feels that he likely would enjoy or watch "any of the rather enjoyable comics based movies, or experienced any of the joy, support or inspiration they bring to millions of people. He hasn't sat next to a ten year old girl watching Captain Marvel or Wonder Woman for the first time." However, she believes people are losing track of <i>why</i> that is. After all, her father loved superhero comics so much that "he tried to make them into something that provoked thought and feelings, that addressed issues, that spoke to people the way superheroes had always spoken to him. That seems crazy to me. I have his collection of Marvel comics, dogeared from reading, from love. I heard so many times about his excitement at finding a stash of second hand Marvel comics in a junkshop, in a box, or buying them off the spinners in Great Yarmouth on holiday. He could not love superhero comics more if he tried. Jack Kirby was his idol, Ditko was his idol."</p>

      <p>However, Moore's love for superhero comics were tainted by his belief that "the medium he adored was ruled by corrupt despots, that the people who made that magic were abused, that their contribution was not valued, that it was stolen from them. He already hated that before Watchmen. He already knew Kirby had been shafted. So when it happened to him, and then again, and then again, it wasn't just a business deal gone awry, or a bit of bad luck, it broke him. The thing he loved most, the thing he poured *all* his time and energy into for his whole entire life, he couldn't do it anymore."</p>
      <p>So it pains her, then, when people try to dismiss her father as a cranky old man when so much of the current comic book industry owes itself to his past work and he only came to this point because he was let down so much by the business side of comic books. As she so nicely concluded, "Can you imagine if he hadn't been fucked over? If instead of being Grumpy Alan Moore Shouting From His Cave he had spent the past 40 years putting out book after book for DC and the rest? Creating vast worlds full of the superheroes he loves? Enjoying comics? Its a damn shame."</p>
      <p>In other words, she wishes her father still loved superhero comics, but she is shocked that people can't understand his well-earned reasons for having such a stance.</p>
