      <h1>40 Years Ago: How Tobe Hooper Tackled Stephen King’s Vampires in ‘Salem’s Lot’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:14:22+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:14</time> by <a rel="author">Tyler Sage</a></address>
      <p>Tobe Hooper, of <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre/"><i>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</i></a> and <i>Poltergeist</i> fame, tried bringing Stephen King's vampire novel <i>Salem's Lot</i> to TV in November 1979. The result was a two-episode miniseries that does some things poorly and yet manages to capture a great deal of King's sense of anxiety and strange other-worldly menace.</p>
      <p>Part of the problem is that King's novels and stories are notoriously hard to make into movies. They tend to be long and interweave a large number of storylines and character arcs, making it almost impossible to condense them without losing important elements.</p>
      <p>But the difficulty also lies in the way King scares you with his words: He likes to create a slow, creeping, enveloping psychological dread that can't always be translated from the page. Many directors have tried their hands at this: Hooper joined <a href="https://screencrush.com/tags/brian-depalma/">Brian DePalma</a>, <a href="https://screencrush.com/tags/stanley-kubrick/">Stanley Kubrick</a>, <a href="https://screencrush.com/tags/rob-reiner/">Rob Reiner</a>, <a href="https://screencrush.com/tags/frank-darabont/">Frank Darabont</a>, <a href="https://screencrush.com/tags/john-carpenter/">John Carpenter</a> and others. All had varying degrees of success.</p>
      <p><i>Salem's Lot</i> opens in Mexico, with a man named Ben Mears (David Soul, just off his four-year run as Hutch in <i>Starsky and Hutch</i>) and a teenager named Mark Petrie (Lance Kerwin) taking refuge in a church, filling vials with holy water, afraid that some unnamed hazard is closing in on them.</p>
      <p>From there, we cut to two years earlier. We're in the town of Salem's Lot, Maine, the state where King famously sets many of his stories. Ben, who grew up in the town, has come back to write a book about the Marsten House: an old, derelict and perhaps even haunted mansion on a hill. This house has coincidentally just been purchased by a pair of men who intend to open an antiques shop in town. One of these men, Richard Straker (James Mason), has established himself in the house; the other, Kurt Barlow (Reggie Nalder), has never been seen.</p>
      <p>As Ben researches his book, he meets and falls in love with a local girl named Susan (Bonnie Bedelia). At the same time, strange events begin to consume the town.</p>
      <p>Two men deliver a huge supernaturally cold crate to the Marsten House; one disappears and the other develops a strange sickness, growing pale and uninterested in the world. A local boy vanishes, only to begin visiting his brother at night, levitating outside a bedroom window and pleading to be let in. More and more people begin to fall sick and vanish – including both of Mark's parents – and eventually Ben figures out what's going on. The unseen man in the Marsten House, Kurt Barlow, is an ancient vampire who's come to take over Salem's Lot.</p>
      <p>In the climactic scene, Ben, Susan and Mark journey into the Marsten House, battle the supernaturally strong Richard Straker and manage to find the vampire in his coffin. Ben drives a stake through his heart but this does not seem to dispel the evil entirely. A fire consumes the house and sweeps down toward the town. Susan vanishes.</p>
      <p>Ben and Mark make a run for it and we find them again back where we started, two years later in Mexico, still being hunted by the vampires from Kurt Barlow's clan. Susan is among them, and in the end Ben is forced to choose between giving in to the love he still feels and killing her.</p>

      <p>These proceedings have a distinctly made-for-TV feel to them. The budget is small and there's and relatively low level of gore and violence, as the series aired on CBS. Despite his skills as a filmmaker, Hooper struggles for the most part to elevate the material, and much of it feels like it could have been directed by any network hack.</p>
      <p>Despite this, there is something effective here. The cast features a number of talented actors who bring a high level of commitment to their parts. James Mason was in his heyday a major British star, and he shines as the vampire's evil protector Richard Straker. <a href="https://screencrush.com/tags/fred-willard/">Fred Willard</a> – known for his roles in <a href="https://screencrush.com/tags/christopher-guest/">Christopher Guest</a>'s mockumentaries – makes an appearance, as do veteran character actors George Dzundza, Geoffrey Lewis and Kenneth McMillan (maybe best remembered for his astounding turn as the floating, insane Vladimir Harkonnen in <a href="https://screencrush.com/tags/david-lynch/">David Lynch</a>'s <i>Dune</i>).</p>
      <p>It's also a treat to see Marie Windsor, who cut her teeth playing femme fatales in some of the great film noirs of the '50s, and Elisha Cook Jr., who appeared in everything from the 1941 version of <i>The Maltese Falcon</i> to Kubrick's <i>The Killing</i> and <i>Rosemary's Baby.</i></p>
      <p>To his credit, Hooper does reference several wonderful vampire tropes. Kurt Barlow is a direct homage to the famous vampire played by Max Schreck in F.W. Murnau's <i>Nosferatu</i> (1922), with the same bald, narrow-faced inhuman appearance. It's a creepy and effective approach and the makeup artists on the film, Jack Young and Ben Lane, were nominated for an Emmy for their work. Hooper also came up with the idea of having vampires levitate outside the second story windows of their victims in a swirl of fog, a wonderful touch that <a href="https://screencrush.com/tags/joel-schumacher/">Joel Schumacher</a> then paid homage to in his 1987 vampire flick <i>The Lost Boys</i>.</p>
      <p>But where the miniseries best succeeds is in its evocation of the slow descent of a group of people from normalcy into a nightmare world. It is this gradual submersion in horror that King excels at, and it's usually aided in his work by the feeling of how closely the evil is connected to the heroes' own histories and the roots of the society that produced them.</p>
      <p>Stephen King does not think particularly well about women and their dilemmas, as his books and most of the movies made from them so often attest, but he is unmatched when dealing with men and their terrors. They are plagued by past transgressions, childhood traumas and duties unfulfilled. The vampire story in <i>Salem's Lot</i>, focusing on a man coming back to the town where he grew up and forging a friendship with an orphaned teenager to target an evil menace, works as a perfect vehicle.</p>
      <p>A good deal of this comes through in the series. In the end, <i>Salem's Lot</i> may not be as good as the novel of the same name, but it does manage to capture a lot of what makes King great.</p>

      <p>Initially set to star David Bowie as the amusingly named Count Downe, the lead role in ‘Son of Dracula’ would instead go to Harry Nilsson, whose songs also make up the soundtrack. The movie, a campy mix of gothic horror and rock music, was produced by Ringo Starr, who also plays Merlin the Magician. Keith Moon, John Bonham, Peter Frampton, Leon Russell and Rolling Stones horn players Jim Rice and Bobby Keys round out the movie's rock 'n' roll band, the Count Downes.</p>

      <p>Roger Daltrey already had appeared in two movies directed by Ken Russell before ‘The Legacy’: ‘Tommy’ (1975), and ‘Lisztomania’ (1977). Daltrey ended up in the movie after offering his mansion as one of ‘The Legacy’’s filming locations, but only if they put him in the film. Daltrey plays Clive Jackson, a super-obnoxious music-industry type. Daltrey meets his end in an all-too-believable scene where he chokes on a chicken bone during dinner (though he had ham) and dies after an attempted tracheotomy.</p>

      <p>In 'Wolfen,' Tom Waits does what he does best: playing the piano while crooning out one of his songs, "Jitterbug Boy," from his 1976 album 'Small Change.' Waits is credited in the film as a "Drunken Bar Owner," Sadly, his short but memorable performance was cut from future physical releases of the film, as rights for its inclusion in video and DVD distribution was not able to be resolved. Lucky for us, the clip can still be viewed on YouTube, where you can see actor Albert Finney enjoying a whiskey while Waits plays in the barroom. 'Wolfen' was directed by Michael Wadleigh, the man responsible for the Academy Award-winning documentary/concert film 'Woodstock.'</p>

In addition to performing "Gangster Rock," Felony contributed two other songs to the soundtrack, reportedly for free. Singer Jeffrey Spry was also a part of the brief band the New Order with Ron Asheton (from the Stooges) and MC5 drummer Dennis "Machine Gun" Thompson. In 1986, Felony's jam "I'm No Animal" made it to the soundtrack for 'Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives.'</p>

      <p>Ontario band Teenage Head started out playing Kiss and Aerosmith covers and would become one of Canada's greatest punk rock triumphs. The band is featured, albeit briefly, in 'Class of 1984' performing their song "Ain't Got No Sense" at a punk club. The soundtrack also features other tracks by the band, as well as by Alice Cooper and Los Angeles punks Fear.</p>

      <h4>Cherrie Currie: 'Parasite' (1982)</h4>
      <p>In 'Parasite,' former Runaways singer Cherie Currie plays Dana, a member of a gang. Best described as a solid B-movie, 'Parasite' also stars a young Demi Moore as a lemon farmer. Currie, whose mother, Marie Harmon, was an actress during the Golden Age of Hollywood, scored roles in 'Rock and Roll High School' (1979) and 'Foxes' (1980) after the breakup of the Runaways. In an interview with 'Fangoria' in 2010, Currie revealed she did not want to do the movie "at all" but was won over by producer Irwin Yablans. Currie also has the distinction of getting to do a gory scene with one of FX master Stan Winston's first movie monsters. She would also experience an accident on the set, which resulted in a severe injury to her spine.</p>

      <h4>Cherie Currie: 'Twilight Zone: The Movie' (1983)</h4>
      <p>Currie would return to film in 1983 for a role in 'Twilight Zone: The Movie' as Sara in the segment "It's a Good Life." The segment is based on the original 1961 'Twilight Zone' episode of the same name starring Billy Mumy as the terrifying six-year-old Anthony Fremont who can do anything, good or evil, with his mind. Coincidentally, Mumy has a cameo in the episode with Currie - an excellent Easter egg for fans of the original series.</p>

      <p>During their heyday in the '80s, D.C.'s 4 Out of 5 Doctors opened shows for the Clash, the Cars, and Ritchie Blackmore. Before their actual appearance in the 1983 slasher pic 'The House on Sorority Row,' they provided a few songs for another horror film, 'The Boogey Man' (1980). In 'The House on Sorority Row' (a favorite of director Quentin Tarantino), 4 Out of 5 Doctors kick out the jams at a sorority house party.</p>

      <h4>David Bowie: 'The Hunger' (1983)</h4>
      <p>The appearance of a rapidly aging David Bowie is one of many remarkable visions in Tony Scott's (the brother of 'Alien' director Ridley) 'The Hunger,' which Roger Ebert described as an "agonizingly bad vampire movie.” Bowie would actually learn to play the cello for the role of 300-year-old vampire John. Goth pioneers Bauhaus were added after Scott was hipped to the band upon seeing Peter Murphy's image in a television ad for Maxell Tapes. It's also rumored Scott saw them live in London before inviting them to appear in the film. Their scene, where Murphy lip-synchs a portion of "Bela Lugosi's Dead" during the film's opening credits, is one of the movies most arresting moments.</p>

      <h4>Deborah Harry: 'Videodrome' (1983)</h4>
      <p>Known to generations of horror fans for its famous mantra "Long Live the New Flesh," 'Videodrome' marks Debbie Harry's first credited acting role. Selected for the film by director David Cronenberg himself, Harry is entirely in charge of her role as Nicki Brand, a new kind of hallucinatory femme fatale who controls her victims with calm, corrosive ease. Harry, a big fan of Cronenberg, accepted the role after reading the script he sent, which at the time had yet to be completed.</p>

      <h4>Alice Cooper: 'Monster Dog' (1984)</h4>
      <p>In 'Monster Dog,' Alice Cooper plays the part of Vincent, one of the biggest rock stars in the world who heads back to his hometown to shoot a video. Filmed in and around Spain, 'Monster Dog' was one of many horror films directed by Claudio Fragasso, a longtime member of Italian cinema and collaborator of the iconic Lucho Fulci. Like Cooper, Fragasso loves to shock his audiences, and his films are exploitive and often fall into the realm of B-movies with better gore. Is Alice Cooper playing himself in 'Monster Dog'?' Yeah, sort of, and when you add werewolves to the equation, you now have a snapshot of how truly glorious horror films in the '80s could be.</p>

      <p>Los Angeles band Sorcery became the fictional Headmistress in 'Rocktober Blood.' Sorcery also recorded a few songs for the slasher flick's soundtrack, "Killer on the Loose," I'm Back," "Rainbow Eyes" and "Watching You." Onetime Mott the Hoople singer Nigel Benjamin also appears in the film as Chris Keane and provided the vocals for three of Sorcery's songs.</p>

      <p>Police singer and solo artist Sting (born Gordon Matthew Sumner) is Dr. Baron Charles Frankenstein in this remake of 1935's 'Bride of Frankenstein.' Directed by Franc Roddam ('Quadrophenia') Sting brings Eva (played by Jennifer Beals from 'Flashdance') back to life. In real life, actor Quentin Crisp (Dr. Zahyus), is a distant relative of Boris Karloff, who most famously portrayed the Frankenstein monster in three films from the '30s, including the classic 'Bride of Frankenstein.'</p>

      <h4>W.A.S.P.: 'The Dungeonmaster' (1985)</h4>
      <p>Blackie Lawless and the rest of W.A.S.P. show up in 'The Dungeonmaster' as villains. The film is essentially an interwoven series of seven stories, each helmed by a different director. W.A.S.P.'s big moment came in a segment called "Heavy Metal," directed by Charles Band, who also directed Cherie Currie in 'Parasite'. Lawless is prominently featured in the segment, which was filmed in two days at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, where the band played itself. They also portrayed demons from the beyond.</p>

      <p>Noted in the book 'The Making of George A. Romero's Day of the Dead' by Lee Karr and effects master Greg Nicotero, the members of NRBQ drove nonstop from Massachusetts after a gig to the Wampum Industrial Facility in Pennsylvania (approximately 600 miles) to be extras in the film. Founding member Terry Adams and horn player Keith Spring made it into the final cut in a blink-and-you-missed-it-moment.</p>

      <p>Stockholm glam band Easy Action appears in the Swedish horror flick 'Blood Tracks' as Solid Gold, a band shooting a new video at an abandoned factory. The group also provided two songs for the movie, "Blood Tracks" and "In the Middle of Nowhere," which were not released with the film. According to director Mats Helge Olsson, the members of Easy Action were incredibly nervous about appearing in the movie, and to help with that, Olsson kept the beer flowing on the set. For most of their time onscreen, Easy Action were drunk.</p>

      <p>'Trick or Treat' comes complete with brief appearances by Ozzy Osbourne as Rev. Aaron Gilstrom and Gene Simmons as radio DJ Nuke, as well as a soundtrack composed by Fastway members "Fast" Eddie Clark and singer Dave King. Simmons was originally offered the role of Sammi Curr, the unfortunate rock star who, despite burning to death suspiciously, continues to communicate with one of his biggest fans from beyond the grave. Blackie Lawless was also up for the role on the condition that W.A.S.P. provide the soundtrack. Lawless' demands didn't go over well with then-director Charles Martin Smith, and Lawless walked away from the project rather than lip-synch Fastway's music.</p>

      <p>Burbank band White Sister (named after a Toto song from their 1979 album 'Hydra') was part of the Sunset Strip hair-metal revolution. In 'Killer Party,' they're featured in a sequence set at a drive-in concession stand, performing "April," which plays out like a music video inside of the film itself. If you watch the scene closely, White Sister guitarist Rick Chadock almost falls off the stage but quickly recovers. Songs by White Sister also show up in two other horror films: "Save Me Tonight" ('Fright Night,' 1985), and "Dancin' on Midnight" ('Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers,' 1989).</p>

      <p>The immutable Grace Jones is the star of the vampire flick 'Vamp,' though Tina Turner had also been considered for the role. Pop artist Keith Haring was enlisted to paint Jones' face and body with elaborate designs for her role as Katrina, the Queen of the Vampires in the film. Katrina had no dialogue throughout the movie, so Jones had to rely entirely on body language.</p>

      <p>'The Lost Boys' makes it into this list thanks to a performance by Tina Turner's former saxophone player Tim Cappello. Cappello was also once a member of Peter Gabriel's band in the late '70s and was pals in high school with Alice Cooper guitarist Kane Roberts. Cappello's scene, where he performs a cover of the Call's "I Still Believe," is about only two minutes long.</p>

      <p>Born Herbert Khaury, Tiny Tim wore his own clown suit for his role as mentally disturbed clown the Magnificent Mervo in 'Blood Harvest' (aka 'Nightmare'). Though known as Tiny Tim, Khaury was actually pretty big, standing around six feet. And, when in full costume and makeup as the Magnificent Mervo, he cut an intimidating figure, adding to the already off-putting role.</p>

      <p>Alice Cooper and director John Carpenter first met at Wrestlemania III in 1987 while Carpenter was working on 'Prince of Darkness.' Cooper apparently expressed interest in appearing in the movie, and the two would continue to communicate through Cooper's longtime manager, Shep Gordon, who would become one of the film's executive producers. Cooper was cast as the leader of the zombie "street-people." After seeing Cooper impale a member of his crew with a microphone stand during a live gig, Carpenter would craft a scene featuring Cooper thrusting part of a bicycle through actor Thom Bray, whose character of Etchinson happened to be listening to Cooper's jam "Prince of Darkness" when Cooper moved in for the kill.</p>

      <p>'Zombie Nightmare' is Thor's (John Mikl Thor) first appearance in a Canuxploitation horror film, appearing along with Adam West of 'Batman' fame. It is so bad it was featured on a 1999 episode of cult TV series 'Mystery Science Theater 3000.' The soundtrack features tracks from Girlschool ("Future Flash" and "C'mon Let Go"), Motörhead ("Ace of Spades"), New York band Virgin Steele ("We Rule the Night") and, of course, Thor, who plays the zombie in the film. Thor, with his Thorkestra, also composed the movie's score.</p>

      <p>'Black Roses' is yet another heavy metal-themed '80s horror film on par with the cheesy excellence of 'Trick or Treat.' Vanilla Fudge drummer and brother of Vinnie Appice, Carmine Appice plays Vinnie Apache, a clear riff on his brother's name. As the drummer of the demonic metal band the Black Roses, Appice's role in the film wasn't a stretch either. 'Black Roses' also features the first movie appearance of actor Vincent Pastore, best known for his role as Big Pussy on 'The Sopranos,' as the father of trouble-making high school student Tony Ames.</p>

      <p>Thor's second Canuxploitation horror film, 'Rock 'n' Roll Nightmare,' is a benchmark of awful goodness shot in just seven days. It is the brainchild of its star, bodybuilding enthusiast, metal legend and native Canadian John Mikl Thor. The film is essentially a vehicle for Thor's musical career; he portrays John Triton, the leader of the band Tritonz. You can thank Thor for everything in this movie, from the script to the score - even the financing for the film came out of Thor's wallet. The only thing Thor seemingly didn't do in this film is direct it; that honor belongs to Canadian director John Fasano, who also directed Carmine Appice in 'Black Roses.'</p>

Twisted Sister also referenced Captain Howdy on their 1984 album 'Stay Hungry' on the track "Horror=Teria (The Beginning): a: Captain Howdy b: Street Justice." The film's soundtrack is as metal as Snider, and features music by Megadeth, Anthrax, Pantera and, of course, Twisted Sister.

Interestingly, the band sent a demo version of "Scream!" over to another horror movie legend, Wes Craven, in the hope he would use it in his movie 'Scream 2.' Craven would pass on the offer, and "Scream!" would join "Descending Angel," "Fiend Without a Face" and "Bruiser" on Romero's soundtrack. The band's love for Romero goes way back. In 1979, they released the single "Night of the Living Dead" on Halloween. The song is not only named for Romero's 1968 film, but it also alludes to the movie's plot with its lyrics.</p>

      <h4>Bruce Dickinson: 'Chemical Wedding' (2008)</h4>
      <p>Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson is a true heavy metal Renaissance man. In 2008, he and Julian Doyle ('Monty Python and the Holy Grail,' 'Brazil,' 'Time Bandits') would write 'Chemical Wedding,' an occult horror movie that was reportedly originally titled 'Number of the Beast.' The film's storyline is based on the "wickedest man in the world," Aleister Crowley -- it was released in the U.S. as 'Crowley' -- and his fictional resurrection 43 years after his death. In addition to writing the movie, Dickinson has a small role as Crowley's blind landlord. Dickinson also released a soundtrack containing songs by Iron Maiden ("Can I Play With Madness") as well as solo material by himself ("Man of Sorrows" 1997).</p>

      <h4>Alice Cooper, Henry Rollins, Iggy Pop, Alex Lifeson: ‘Suck’ (2009)</h4>
      <p>One of the most amusing moments in 'Suck' involves a scene with Alex Lifeson. In the movie, the Rush guitarist plays a border guard who interrogates the fictional band the Winners as they try to enter the U.S. Lifeson's scene is more than three minutes long, during which he cracks a joke about how he "used to be in a band." Alice Cooper plays a weirdo bartender, Rollins is Rockin' Roger, a DJ who loves to shock his listeners every time he opens his mouth, and Iggy Pop plays Victor, a producer whose neck ends up on the wrong side of a knife. The soundtrack to 'Suck' includes songs by both Cooper and Pop, as well as the Velvet Underground, the Rolling Stones, Robert Johnson and the Stooges.</p>

      <h4>Chester Bennington: ‘Saw 3D: The Final Chapter’ (2010)</h4>
      <p>In an interview following the release of the seventh 'Saw' film, Chester Bennington praised the original 2004 movie, calling it the "greatest horror film of all time." The producer of the franchise, Mark Burg, happened to be a neighbor of one of Bennington's Linkin Park bandmates, and when Burg learned about Bennington's love of 'Saw,' he cast him in 'The Final Chapter.' In the film, Bennington plays Evan, one of four neo-Nazi gang members who fall victim to Jigsaw (played by Tobin Bell).</p>

      <h4>Corey Taylor: ‘Fear Clinic’ (2014)</h4>
      <p>'Fear Clinic' was initially developed as a web series in 2009. Later it was adapted into a feature-length movie starring Robert Englund and Kane Hodder, who played Jason Voorhees in five of the 'Friday the 13th' flicks. In the film version of 'Fear Clinic,' Slipknot's Corey Taylor plays Bauer, an employee at Englund's clinic, but he was not director Rob Hall's first choice. Originally Hall offered the part to Robert Trujillo of Metallica, but he turned it down due to other commitments. Trujillo suggested Hall get a hold of Taylor and, a week later, Taylor was on the set in Medina, Ohio. Taylor's other band, Stone Sour, contributed a cover of Metal Church's 1986 jam "The Dark" to the soundtrack.</p>

      <p>In 2012, Henry Rollins got a call from an employee, who, according to Rollins, "runs all his stuff." She had just read the script for 'He Never Died' and told Rollins to read it immediately, which he did. Producer Zach Hagan and director Jason Krawczyk wanted Rollins to do the role so badly they informed him he would not need to audition for the part of anti-hero Jack, an immortal who needs to eat human flesh to survive.</p>

      <h4>Dave Mustaine: ‘Halloween Pussy Trap Kill Kill’ (2017)</h4>
      <p>Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine never appears in 'Halloween Pussy Trap Kill Kill,' but you can hear him as the voice of the maniacal villain Mastermind. The role is in the spirit of Jigsaw from the 'Saw' films, as Mastermind's "mind" is completely deranged. Los Angeles all-girl band Kill Pussy Kill also play themselves in the film. The film's title and Kill Pussy Kill are both homages to director Russ Meyer and his 1965 film 'Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!'</p>

      <h4>Iggy Pop and Tom Waits: ‘The Dead Won't Die’ (2019)</h4>
      <p>Jim Jarmusch wrote and directed 'The Dead Don't Die,' a zombie horror and comedy movie based in the fictional town of Centerville, Penn. Jarmusch penned what may be the best backstory ever for a character for his pal Iggy Pop, who plays a coffee-seeking zombie. It was based in part on a real-life incident involving Pop and his girlfriend, who were in a motorcycle accident after leaving a Blue Oyster Cult gig in 1973. Jarmusch was undoubtedly inspired by the fact Iggy played a show with Blue Oyster Cult and Kiss on New Year's Eve in 1973. Another of Jarmusch's past collaborators, Tom Waits, plays Hermit Bob, a resident of Centerville who lives off the grid in the woods. And, in addition to his role as a store clerk and later a guitar-playing zombie, Americana singer-songwriter Sturgill Simpson wrote and recorded the movie's title song.</p>
