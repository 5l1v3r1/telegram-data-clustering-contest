      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> has become the talk of the internet once more, but this time it’s for having six toes on each foot.</p>
      <p>The reality star, 39, has got fans everywhere freaking out over the fact it appears she’s got an extra digit on each of her feet after fans spotted it in recent photos.</p>
      <p>While Kim has never addressed the rumours, fans can’t work out whether the toe they’re seeing is actually there or whether it’s a trick of the light.</p>
      <p>The sixth toe debate comes up every now and again, as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/21/kim-kardashian-6-toes-fans-demand-answers-amid-photoshop-fail-10605439/">the mysterious digit pops up in her red carpet photos as well as adverts for her product launches</a>.</p>
      <p>The latest being this week’s red carpet photos from the American Influencer Awards, where the pesky toe was visible in her red and Perspex heels.</p>
      <p>It gained so much attention that nobody was looking at her stunning high-necked red dress with a thigh split and sleek, pulled-back hairdo.</p>

      <p>Though on closer observation, it doesn’t actually look like an extra appendage but rather the side of her foot tricking the eye, some fans are convinced it’s there.</p>

      <p>They tweeted: ‘Is nobody gonna talk about why Kim Kardashian has 6 toes or???’ and: ‘Just seen a picture of kim kardashian with 6 toes my friday is now ruined’.</p>
      <p>Another added: ‘Hear me out. Kim Kardashian has 6 toes. She’s been strategically hiding this for years with shoes that cover the little guy or hiding that foot in pictures. She didn’t have it removed because they were waiting for a quiet moment to use it for some quick publicity.’</p>
      <p>One of Kim’s reps debunked the extra toe controversy in the summer, after it popped up in her perfume ad, telling Page Six: ‘The confusing illusion is the result not of Photoshop, but of the sideways angle of the star’s foot.’</p>
      <p>Mystery = solved.</p>
