      <p>Transferwise, a breakout Fintech hit, has added Malaysia to its list of countries where it offers its currency transfer services. According to a blog post, last year, Malaysia’s international money transfers grew 23.3%, to RM 41 billion (USD $9.9 billion). But most of these transfers are using traditional banks which tend to gouge customers by charging hidden fees and not using the “real exchange rate.”</p>
      <p>This is Transferwise’s fourth Asian country where it has launched it services. Alongside Malaysia, Transferwise is available in Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore.</p>
      <p>Transferwise <a href="https://transferwise.com/sg/blog/transferwise-launches-malaysia">reports</a>:</p>
      <p>
        <i>TransferWise is the building the best way to move money around the world. 6 million people are already transferring over RM 20 billion every month. That’s a saving of over RM 6 billion every year compared to if they used a bank.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Transferwise claims to be four times less expensive than a traditional bank.</p>
      <p>Transferwise is also preparing its multi-currency account and debit card for Malaysia as well. In reality, Transferwise is a stealth bank providing bank-like services without calling themselves a bank. The one missing piece of the puzzle is an interest-bearing account. Prediction: Transferwise will start rolling out savings accounts in 2020. Another nail in the coffin of traditional banks.</p>
