      <p>The Chairperson of the Governance and Administration Committee has opened public submissions on the Public Service Legislation Bill.</p>
      <p>The Public Service Legislation Bill proposes a modern legislative framework for achieving a more adaptive and collaborative Public Service by expanding the types of agencies that comprise the Public Service, unified by a common purpose, ethos, and strengthened leadership arrangements.</p>
      <p>The Public Service Legislation Bill would repeal the State Sector Act 1988 to replace it with a new Public Service Act, and make a small number of related amendments to the Public Finance Act 1989. In doing this, it aims to:<br/>• establish the purpose, principles, and values of an apolitical public service:<br/>• recognise the role of the public service to support the Crown in its commitment to its relationships with Māori:<br/>• provide a more flexible set of options for organisational arrangements to support the public service in better responding to priorities and joining up more effectively:<br/>• strengthen leadership across the public service, and provides for system- and future-focused leadership.<br/>The Chair is keen to hear your submission on this bill. You can make a submission on the Parliament website.<br/><b>Tell the Governance and Administration Committee what you think</b><br/><a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/make-a-submission/document/52SCGA_SCF_BILL_93134/public-service-legislation-bill">Make a submission</a> on the bill by midnight on Friday, 31 January 2020.<br/><b>For more details about the bill:</b><br/>• <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2019/0189/latest/d795037e2.html">Read the full content of the bill</a><br/>• <a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_93134/public-service-legislation-bill">Get more details about the bill/petition</a><br/>• <a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_93134/tab/video">What’s been said in Parliament about the bill?</a><br/>• <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GASCNZ/">Follow the committee’s Facebook page for updates</a></p>
