      <p>Jazz the giraffe arrived at The Rhino Orphanage in Limpopo province just days after birth. A farmer found him in the wild, weak and dehydrated, and called the centre for help.</p>
      <p>Resident watchdog Hunter quickly began to care for the newcomer, and orphanage caretaker Janie Van Heerden said the pair bonded immediately.</p>
