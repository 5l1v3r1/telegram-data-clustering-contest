      <p>David Walliams’s foray into writing books for children has proved to be extremely lucrative – he’s made over £100million from his novels.</p>
      <p>The actor, comedian and Britain’s Got Talent judge, 48, wrote his first book in 2008 after signing a deal with HarperCollins, and in just 11 years has become one of the UK’s highest-earning authors.</p>
      <p>Although it’s estimated around £10million of the £100million earnings go to David, it still puts him in an exclusive club with the likes of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-potter/">Harry Potter</a> creator JK Rowling, Gruffalo writer Julia Donaldson and Tracy Beaker writer Jacqueline Wilson.</p>
      <p>The Bookseller magazine claims he made £17million in the last year alone, and has written 13 children’s story books, four collections of short stories and seven picture books.</p>
      <p>Some of his titles, including Gangsta Granny and Mr Stink have also been made into films for the BBC, too.</p>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/15/david-walliams-married-many-children-happened-lara-stone-10576152/">David shares his son Alfred with ex-wife Lara Stone,</a> and told The Sun: ‘I love being a dad. It is the best thing of all and totally life-changing.</p>

      <p>‘You feel there is finally some meaning to your life. Everything you do after they come along is for them or relates to them.’</p>
      <p>While reading is a big part of their lives, David likes to vary what his son reads: ‘I don’t push my books on to him. I don’t want him to grow up and feel like, “We never read any books other than my dad’s”.</p>
      <p>‘But reading with my son is one of the best parts of being a father. It is a pleasure to share the stories I loved as a child, like the [Roald] Dahl and Dr Seuss books, and discover new ones.</p>
      <p>‘I’d urge all parents to make time to read with their children, as it is a joy for both of you. What could be better than firing their imagination just before they drift off to sleep?’</p>
