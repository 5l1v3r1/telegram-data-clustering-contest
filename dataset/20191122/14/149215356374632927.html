      <h1>Trump gets doubly misogynistic with Fox &amp; Friends attacks on Marie Yovanovitch and Kellyanne Conway</h1>

      <p>President Trump had <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/655770/61-things-donald-trump-said-about-women">a few more things to say about women</a> this morning.</p>
      <p>Trump called into <i>Fox &amp; Friends</i> on Friday for his regular bout of "stress relief," as host Brian Kilmeade <a href="https://twitter.com/CillizzaCNN/status/1197876647489417216">called it</a>, launching into a rant about ousted U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/878716/trump-blows-republicans-entire-yovanovitch-hearing-strategy-single-tweet">testified</a> in a public impeachment hearing last week. It was Trump who did that ousting more than six months ago, and yet he still had some complaints about how Yovanovitch apparently decorated the embassy during her tenure.</p>
      <p>In multiple sentences, Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1197878059938013184?s=20">explained</a> how Yovanovitch apparently refused to hang up his picture at the embassy in Ukraine. "She said bad things about me, she refused to defend me," Trump complained. "This was not an angel, this woman." Then, stopping himself before saying "she wouldn't hang" his picture again, Trump relayed his interpretation of a conversation with a GOP lawmaker who interviewed Yovanovitch at her hearing. "Why are you being so kind?" Trump apparently asked. "'Well, sir, she's a woman. We have to be nice,'" he claims they responded.</p>

      <p>Next up, Trump went after one of the women who's firmly on his side: White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. Conway's husband George Conway is one of Trump's <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/878150/george-conway-mocks-republicans-ridiculous-impeachment-arguments-rare-cable-news-appearance">top antagonists</a>, and Trump on Friday blamed Kellyanne for that, <a href="https://twitter.com/ToluseO/status/1197875268850982912">saying</a> "She must've done some bad things to him, because that man's crazy."</p>
