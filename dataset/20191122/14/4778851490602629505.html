        <b>Celtic have been hit with a €15,000 (around £13,000) fine by UEFA as punishment for the banners unveiled in the Europa League clash with Lazio at Celtic Park last month.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Hoops have also been sanctioned for "offensive chanting" while the Serie A side have also copped a €10,000 fine for the latter charge.</p>
      <p>Celtic recorded a 2-1 victory over the Italians but the game was nearly overshadowed by events off the pitch, with Lazio fans marching through Glasgow giving fascist salutes and chanting a song popular with the Italian far-right en route to the game.</p>
      <p>Inside the stadium, Celtic supporters group the Green Brigade displayed several banners including one inviting their opponents to "**** off" in Italian as well as one depicting Benito Mussolini hanging with the slogan "Follow Your Leader."</p>
      <p>UEFA's response was to charge Celtic with displaying "illicit banners and chanting" while European football's governing body also sanctioned Lazio over offensive chanting.</p>
      <p>The fine is the latest in a long line of punishments dished out to the Scottish champions by UEFA.</p>
      <p>It is the 19th time that Celtic have incurred the wrath of European football's governing body since 2007, and their third charge of the 2019/20 campaign.</p>
      <p>UEFA's control, ethics and disciplinary body fined Celtic more than £10,000 after supporters set off flares in a Europa League match with Romanian side CFR Cluj, while the Scottish Premiership side had to pay a similar fine after travelling fans were found to have used flares and thrown objects in the second leg of their Europa League play-off with AIK in Stockholm in August.</p>
      <p>The Hoops could also face further charges, and subsequent fines, with UEFA still to scrutinise Celtic's 2-1 win over Lazio in Rome earlier this month.</p>
