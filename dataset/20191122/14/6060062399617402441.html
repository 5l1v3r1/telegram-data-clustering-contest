      <p>Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4">President Donald Trump</a>'s staunchest allies, praised former <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-joe-biden-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3?r=US&amp;IR=T">Vice President Joe Biden</a> in the highest terms in a 2015 interview that resurfaced this week.</p>
      <p>In the clip from <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-joe-biden_n_7714708?1435860129=">a Huffington Post interview</a>, Graham gets emotional while calling Biden "as good a man as God ever created."</p>
      <p>The South Carolina Republican said he called Biden after the vice president's son, Beau, died from cancer in 2015. The two had a "long" talk about the future of Biden's family. </p>
      <p>"We don't agree on much, but I think he's been dealt a really gut blow," Graham said. "His heart's been ripped out but he's going to make sure the other members of his family are well taken care of."</p>
      <p>"He came to my ceremony and said some of the most incredibly heartfelt things that anybody could ever say to me," Graham said. "And he's the nicest person I think I've ever met in politics." </p>
      <p>Biden and Graham have long been close, despite their opposing politics. In 2013, <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/joe-biden-to-lindsey-graham-i-will-rip-your-skin-off-and-i-expect-a-thank-you-note/">Biden told Graham</a> he would do whatever it took to get Graham reelected.</p>
      <p>But Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/graham-launches-probe-into-bidens-burisma-and-ukraine/2019/11/21/5a5675b4-0ca5-11ea-97ac-a7ccc8dd1ebc_story.html">launched an inquiry</a> this week into Biden's communications with Ukrainian officials, including any conversations Biden may have had about the Ukrainian gas company his son Hunter was on the board of. The move is part of the Republican Party's attempts to push back on the House impeachment probe.</p>
