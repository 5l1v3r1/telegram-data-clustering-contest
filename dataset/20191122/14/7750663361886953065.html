      <p>Steve Clarke's side have been drawn to host Israel in the semi-finals of the Euro 2020 play-offs next March, with the winner facing a trip to either Norway or Serbia in the final.</p>
      <p>The Israel clash takes place on March 26, five days after Gers are scheduled to face St Mirren in Paisley, although that fixture could yet be moved for TV purposes.</p>
      <p>Clarke has already urged Scottish Professional Football League chiefs to "do all they can" to help the Scots by ensuring there are no Sunday fixtures before their vital semi-final Hampden showdown.</p>
      <p>And Gerrard said: "I represent this club in this country so for me I give it the support I need to give it. I certainly won't be standing in the way.</p>
      <p>"But we don't make those decisions. Ultimately it will be down to the SFA and stuff.</p>
      <p>"We'll go with the flow and if it means us skipping a game or adjusting a game we'll do everything we can to support (Scotland). That's what you've got to do."</p>
      <p>And Gerrard reckons Gers midfielder Ryan Jack could yet be a key figure for Scotland next year after impressing on his return to the international fold last week against Cyprus and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>He said: "I watched both games and I thought against Cyprus he was finding his way back into the international set up and getting used to the players around him.</p>
      <p>"It was his first start under Steve Clarke and I think Ryan's performance looked like he was adapting to everyone around him.</p>
      <p>"But in the second game he was outstanding. He showed the form that he's been in for us for an awful long time.</p>
      <p>"I'm sure he's given Steve Clarke something to think about because I think that midfield three – just to prove I'm not biased – of (Celtic's Callum) McGregor, Jack and John McGinn were outstanding as a threesome."</p>
