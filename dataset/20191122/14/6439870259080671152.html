      <p>STAFFORD, Conn. (WTIC/CNN) - A car that burst into flames at a Connecticut intersection could have killed the driver, but a passerby's quick action saved his life.</p>
      <p>The whole thing was caught on video by a traffic camera.</p>
      <p>Glenwood Little was driving down Main Street when his vehicle erupted in a ball of fire.</p>
      <p>Video shows that within seconds, a car going by pulls over. Edward Cyr jumps out and rushes to help.</p>
      <p>"I noticed there was a man in the car, there was someone in the driver's seat, so I told my husband, I said, 'You need to pull over and do something,'" said Sandra Cyr, Edward Cyr's wife.</p>
      <p>Edward Cyr runs across the road in an attempt to save the person behind the wheel.</p>
      <p>"I pushed him kind of into the back, reached down to the seat belt and unbuckled him and then pulled him out," he said. "Then I realized his jacket was melting on him and his bonnet."</p>
      <p>Stafford fire officials said Little was carrying two gas cans in the backseat when his car exploded Nov. 1.</p>
      <p>Little suffering minor burns, thanks to the Cyrs.</p>
      <p>"I didn't really think about the danger; I was thinking about the gentleman in the car," Edward Cyr said.</p>
      <p>The car was completely engulfed by the time fire crews arrived on scene</p>
      <p>"I don't know if it tipped over, was leaking or what, and there was smoking materials involved," said Stafford Fire Chief David Lucia.</p>
      <p>The Town of Stafford presented Edward Cyr an award for his act of heroism Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"I mean, when I look at the word 'hero' in the dictionary, it's Ed," Lucia said.</p>
      <p>The hero also was reunited with the man he rescued.</p>
      <p>"I shook his hand and he said thank you to me," Edward Cyr said. "I just didn't have the words, no words. I'm going to get emotional now."</p>
