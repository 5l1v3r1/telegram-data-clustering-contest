      <p>Democrat sources have revealed that Santa Claus is on his way to the Marshes Shopping Centre in Dundalk on Friday, November 29 at 5pm. </p>
      <p>To mark the occasion of his arrival from the North Pole there will be a light show, choirs and Christmas music from LMFM. </p>
      <p>This year, Santa’s grotto at Marshes is bigger and better than ever, and of course, Santa’s little helpers will be around to give him a hand.</p>
      <p>Mr. Claus will be at Marshes every day until Christmas Eve, giving children the chance to visit the grotto and create unforgettable festive memories.</p>
      <p>“I am very pleased to be coming back to beautiful Dundalk to meet all the girls and boys, and hear what they want for Christmas,” said Santa, taking a break from Christmas preparations at the North Pole, </p>
      <p>“The boys and girls must let me know whether they have been naughty or nice and whether they will be in bed early on Christmas Eve.”</p>
      <p>One of Santa’s elves will also be acting as a photographer to capture every child’s meeting with Santa.</p>
      <p>On the following day, Saturday, November 30, Frozen 2 will be the theme for November’s Little Monsters Kids Club at Marshes Food Court between 12 - 4pm.</p>
      <p>December’s Little Monsters will take place on Saturday, December 28 between 12 pm-4 pm when children will prepare for New Year’s Eve with balloon modeling, party hat decorating face painting and New Year wishes.</p>
      <p>Marshes Christmas Wishes has returned this year. Visitors to Marshes can pick up an entry form in the Centre and drop it into the gift entry box beside Customer Services.</p>
      <p>One wish will be granted each week between now and Christmas. </p>
