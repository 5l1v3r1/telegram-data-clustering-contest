      <h3>The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen …</h3>
      <p>Victoria Wood and Julie Walters: <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04zcmt2">The Waitress sketch</a>. The simplicity of it is amazing. One great idea, one great performer and the rest sorts itself out. Perfect.</p>
      <h3>The funniest film I’ve ever seen …</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFFYIECEPag">Airplane! by Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker</a>. I love their editing discipline. A joke that didn’t get a laugh at previews was automatically cut out.</p>
      <h3>The funniest person I know …</h3>
      <p>[Comic and Delaney’s wife] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngwhN0w0T-g">Sarah Millican</a>. And I’d still say that even if I didn’t have to.</p>
      <h3>The funniest heckle I’ve ever had …</h3>
      <p>Sunny afternoon gig in a tent for bikers: one slips round the back for a sneaky wee, inadvertently creating a very graphic shadow puppet behind me on the stage. Like a Hells Angel <a href="https://www.brussels.be/manneken-pis">Manneken Pis</a>.</p>
      <h3>The funniest meal I’ve ever eaten …</h3>
      <p>Frogs’ legs. It’s hard to eat without looking like you’re graphically “performing a sex act”, as the tabloids say.</p>
      <h3>The funniest dream …</h3>
      <p>The Beach Boys were driving around Solihull in tanks trying to kill me, and I had to find a swimming pool to hide in. Terrifying at the time.</p>
      <h3>The funniest thing that shouldn’t be funny …</h3>
      <p>Children falling over. I’d watch a whole show of this. With a voiceover by Harry Hill. Oh, hang on, I’ve just invented You’ve Been Framed!.</p>
      <h3>The funniest joke I’ve ever heard …</h3>
      <p>A cyclops and a unicorn – now that’s an accident waiting to happen. By Rohan Agalawatta.</p>
