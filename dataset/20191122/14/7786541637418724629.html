      <p><b>MOKOPANE, South AfricaÂ (AP)</b> - A dog in South Africa has befriended a baby giraffe that was abandoned at birth, rescued and taken to a local orphanage.</p>
      <p>Jazz the giraffe arrived at The Rhino Orphanage just days after birth. A farmer found him in the wild, weak and dehydrated, and called the center for help.</p>
      <p>Resident watchdog Hunter quickly began to care for the newcomer.</p>
      <p>Caretaker Janie Van Heerden says they bonded immediately.</p>
      <p>She says the baby giraffe had been given IV fluids and is doing much better. He is being fed milk and is trying to eat leaves.</p>
      <p>"Possibly soon he will be able to go home," she said Friday.</p>
