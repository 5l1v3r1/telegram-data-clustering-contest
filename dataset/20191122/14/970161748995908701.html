      <p>A bitter ex-girlfriend become one of the first women to be convicted of sharing revenge porn after sharing intimate photos of her former partner.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline Doyle, 55, used a fake Facebook profile to send pictures of her victim’s genitals to his boss and daughter.</p>
      <p>She also complained to one of her partner’s senior managers to say her ex-boyfriend had taken the images himself, Plymouth Crown Court heard.</p>
      <p>This is one of very few cases brought under new revenge porn legislation, and one of the first where the perpetrator was a woman.</p>
      <p>Doyle, of Plympton, Devon, pleaded guilty to two counts of disclosing private sexual photographs without consent with the intention of causing distress on June 8 and June 10.</p>
      <p>The court heard how the defendant broke up with her partner, with whom she lived, in June last year.</p>

      <p>To her horror she opened the message and saw one picture of her father’s face and another of his genitalia.</p>
      <p>She forwarded it to her dad who confirmed that the photos were taken while he was in a relationship.</p>
      <p>Judge James Townsend said: ‘It is particularly unpleasant after you involved a member of the victim’s family.’</p>
      <p>The Crown Prosecution Service’s Nick Lewin said told the court how Doyle emailed the same pictures to her partner’s senior manager at work.</p>
      <p>Acting as if she was an aggrieved customer, she said: ‘I am not happy with your staff. One of them sent these to my wife.’</p>
      <p>Mr Lewin added: ‘I am glad to say that the company kept things under wraps and the only other people who know are that manager and the victim’s direct line manager.’</p>
      <p>The court heard how the victim has since kept in touch with Doyle, who has ‘expressed a high level of remorse’.</p>
      <p>Michael Green, defending, said drinking alcohol ‘seemed to be the build-up to this level of offending’.</p>

      <p>Doyle, who has no previous convictions, was handed a 12 month community order and a two month home curfew.</p>
      <p>She was also told to pay an £85 victim surcharge and must undertake rehabilitation activity.</p>
      <p>The judge declined to pass a restraining order to keep Doyle away from the victim.</p>
      <p>It became a specific criminal offence to disclose private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress in April 2015.</p>
      <p>But the number of prosecutions and convictions resulting from the new law are still low.</p>
      <p>A support service for victims said the low numbers were ‘no surprise’ as victims often fear going through the legal process would be too traumatic.</p>
      <p>Local news site Plymouth Live succeeded in removing a court order which effectively prevented media reporting Doyle’s identity.</p>
