      <h1>What to watch on Netflix Canada in December 2019</h1>
      <h2>NOW critics pick the best TV shows and movies coming to Netflix Canada, including Marriage Story, The Witcher, Tiffany Haddish: Black Mitzvah and You season 2</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:36:57+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:36</time> by <a rel="author">NOW Staff</a></address>
      <h3>WHAT WE CAN’T WAIT TO WATCH</h3>
      <p>
        <b>The Witcher</b>
      </p>
      <p>As the world searches for the next Game Of Thrones, Netflix throws down this lavish sword-and-sorcery series – based on the work of Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski – starring Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia, a golden-eyed, white-haired monster hunter who travels the mystical kingdom of The Continent slaying beasts – while also starting to wonder whose will he truly serves. The streaming service is so committed to the show that it has already ordered a second season, and it’s rolling out the episodes of season one weekly, for that extra prestige feel. <i>December 20</i></p>
      <p>
        <b>Tiffany Haddish: Black Mitzvah</b>
      </p>
      <p>Typically, Jewish girls and boys have their bat mitzvahs and bar mitzvahs when they turn 13. But Tiffany Haddish is celebrating her coming of age on her 40th birthday. The comedian recently learned about her Jewish heritage – her dad was an Eritrean Jew – and wanted to get in touch with her roots. In this stand-up special, Haddish reflects on her life, from being homeless and raising herself, to the time Beyoncé gave her a jumpsuit. No doubt, Haddish’s got chutzpah. <i>December 3</i></p>
      <p>
        <b>6 Underground</b>
      </p>
      <p>What happens when self-aware action hero Ryan Reynolds teams up with decidedly un-self-aware action director Michael Bay? We’re about to find out in 6 Underground, which appears to be an international explosions-and-shooting picture revolving around an elite team of super-awesome crime fighters who operate with impunity because they’re all dead. We assume it’s just a technical thing, like that they’ve been declared dead to keep their families safe, but if it turns out they’re ghosts or zombies fighting crime, that could be even cooler. <i>December 13</i></p>
      <p>
        <b>John Mulaney And The Sack Lunch Bunch</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not content with being one of the best regarded stand-ups in America, a delightful voice actor (in Big Mouth and Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse) and the wild card that makes his episodes of Documentary Now! really pop, John Mulaney decided he wanted to make a contemporary version of those empowering TV specials he watched as a kid, like Free To Be... You And Me. So Netflix let him, and now it’s here: a sketches-and-songs variety show with Mulaney, children and celebrity guest stars like David Byrne, Natasha Lyonne, Annaleigh Ashford, Richard Kind, André De Shields, Shereen Pimentel and Mysterio himself, Jake Gyllenhaal. We’re listening. <i>December 24</i></p>
      <p>
        <b>Lost In Space (season 2)</b>
      </p>
      <p>You may recall that the first season of Netflix’s expensive upgrade of the fondly remembered 60s sci-fi series ended with our heroes finally getting lost in space – drawn into a wormhole, specifically, to meet the alien species that created that mysterious Robot. What happens now? More thrilling interstellar adventures, which our codependent family (Toby Stephens, Molly Parker, Taylor Russell, Mina Sundwall and Maxwell Jenkins) will presumably survive by the skin of their collective teeth, while Ignacio Serricchio’s ace pilot Don West tries to help and Parker Posey’s Dr. Smith does her chaotic-neutral thing. It’s what the people want. Read our season 1 review <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/movies/tv-and-streaming/review-lost-in-space-netflix/">here</a>. <i>December 24</i></p>
      <p>
        <b>You (season 2)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Just in time for prime bingeing time – i.e. the days before and after Christmas when everyone is permanently in pajamas and robes – the second season of psychological thriller You is back. In the second season, Joe is laying low in California, dealing with his past and searching for love. Although high-brow TV watchers might write this series off as romanticizing stalking, as our reviewer said of the first season, it’s actually a smart satire that skewers modern culture.

      <h3>SOLID BETS</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Marriage Story</b>
      </p>
      <p>After ripping people’s hearts out during its all-too-brief theatrical release at the TIFF Bell Lightbox, Noah Baumbach’s devastating study of a dissolving couple may not be as powerful when viewers are able to pause it and go for a walk to shake off the emotional weight. But Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson’s fully committed performances will pull you along just the same, and the streaming format allows us to immediately revisit key scenes, and marvel at the incredible work Julie Hagerty, Merritt Wever, Ray Liotta, Alan Alda and a never-better Laura Dern are doing in the margins.

      <p>
        <b>The Shape Of Water</b>
      </p>
      <p>Guillermo del Toro’s lyrical Cold War monster movie plays like a cross between Amélie and Creature From The Black Lagoon, as a mute cleaner (Sally Hawkins) working in a secret government facility befriends an amphibious biped (Doug Jones) and decides to spring him from captivity. There aren’t many filmmakers operating at this scale who put as much trust in their audience as del Toro does – and this time, that trust was rewarded with four Oscars, including best picture and best director. And even though it’s playing Baltimore, Toronto’s never looked so good. Read our review <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/movies/reviews/the-shape-of-water-guillermo-del-toro/">here</a>. <i>December 1</i></p>
      <p>
        <b>Titanic</b>
      </p>
      <p>If the last time you watched Titanic was on VHS, when it was split over two tapes, you’re in luck: it’s finally coming to Netflix. During your re-watch, gush over young Leo and Kate, giggle at the nude drawing scene (“Draw me like one of your French girls”), get overly angry that Rose didn’t move over a couple inches on that damn floating door and then sing along to My Heart Will Go On. <i>December 1</i></p>
