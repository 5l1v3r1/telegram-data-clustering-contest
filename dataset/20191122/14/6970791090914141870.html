      <p>New York rapper <b>French Montana</b> might be on the road to recovery. New reports claim the hip-hop artist received medical treatment this week in California.</p>
      <p>According to reports, <a href="https://people.com/music/french-montana-hospitalized-medical-call/">Montana was hospitalized</a> Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <blockquote>A Public Information Officer with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department confirms to PEOPLE that deputies responded to the rapper’s Calabasas home just before 1:30 p.m. for a medical call. After arriving at the scene, French, 35, was transported to a hospital, but the LACSD officer could not disclose what he was treated for or where he was taken. (People)</blockquote>
      <p>French is <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1096016/french-montana-rushed-to-hospital-over-cardiac-issues">reportedly on the road to recovery</a> following the medical scare.</p>
      <blockquote>Despite the alarming hospitalization, we’re told French is awake and alert. He is currently undergoing treatment and is expected to be released sometime later Thursday. (E! News)</blockquote>
      <p>Some media outlets speculate <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/21/french-montana-hospitalized-heart-rate-elevated-stomach-pain/">what could have ultimately</a> caused the hospitalization.</p>
      <blockquote>Our sources say French has been traveling a lot over the last couple of weeks — including trips to the Middle East and Europe. We’re told some around him suspect he could have been exposed to contaminated food. (TMZ)</blockquote>
