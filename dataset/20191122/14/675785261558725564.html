      <h2>Barack Obama has explained why he sometimes prefers a Hampton hotel stay compared to the lavish suites where he has stayed in his career</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:20:34+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:20</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, https://www.facebook.com/juliedjourno</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/barack-obama">Barack Obama</a> has no doubt stayed in some pretty incredible hotel suites throughout his career.</p>
      <p>After all, during his time as US President he travelled all over the world, which included stays in some of the world's swankiest hotels.</p>
      <p>Then when his eight years in office came to an end, he enjoyed a getaway on Richard Branson's luxurious <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/caribbean/gallery/inside-sir-richard-bransons-private-20826040">private island Necker Island</a> .</p>
      <p>No doubt Obama still has access to lavish suites and swish hotel stays, but it turns out that sometimes he favours a room without all of the frills and just wants the basics for a good night's sleep.</p>
      <p>In fact, the former US President has admitted that he's partial to a stay at Hampton by Hilton hotels.</p>
      <p>So, what do these hotels have that the opulent presidential suites don't offer? Well... an easier layout.</p>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2019/11/20/obama-appreciates-hampton-inn-much-next-business-dad/">Washington Post</a> , Obama explained during a conference in Atlanta: "Before I go to bed, [I] go from room to room to turn off all the lights, and there are a bunch of different lamps, and sometimes they hide where the light switches are because they want to make them look really cool.</p>
      <p>"And it might take me 15 minutes to shut down, where if I was just in the Hampton Inn, there’s like one light switch, one bathroom door, and the bed, and the TV remote; I’m good."</p>
      <p>It's not just the light switches which can be problematic, but also the sheer size of some of the accommodation offerings.</p>
      <p>He later quipped: "These presidential suites - there are so many rooms and I get lost".</p>

      <p>That doesn't mean that he will be turning down stays at luxury hotels - he himself admits thats some of the rooms can be pretty spectacular and offer unrivalled views of the destinations where they're located.</p>
      <p>It just seems that given the choice he prefers a more modest setting when staying somewhere overnight.</p>
      <p>The good news is that, if you're feeling inspired to follow in his footsteps there are plenty of <a href="https://www.hilton.com/en/hampton/">Hampton by Hilton hotels</a> around the world; in fact, there are 29 in the UK alone.</p>
