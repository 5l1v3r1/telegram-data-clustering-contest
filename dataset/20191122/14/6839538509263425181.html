      <p>NASA scientists have been shocked by the 'extremely abnormal' medical test results returned by astronauts on the International Space Station.</p>
      <p>NASA has observed a bizarre effect of human spaceflight: blood going backwards in astronauts' veins.</p>
      <p>The strange phenomenon also resulted in blood clotting for one astronaut, sparking a panic among NASA doctors, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/10399465/nasa-blood-clot-backwards-jugular-vein-astronauts-iss/"><i>The Sun</i></a> reports.</p>
      <p>An unnamed astronaut on the International Space Station was carrying out an ultrasound on their body – guided by experts on the ground.</p>
      <p>Similar tests before the astronaut went to space came back normal.</p>
      <p>But the scan taken in space revealed a clump of clotted blood, shocking NASA doctors.</p>
      <p>"We were not expecting this. This has never been reported before," said NASA scientist Karina Marshall-Goebel, speaking to <i>The Atlantic.</i></p>
      <p>The astronaut didn't have any clot-related symptoms, but was given blood-thinning drugs for the rest of their time in orbit.</p>
      <p>This clotting was declared a new risk for humans in spaceflight – but the mysterious phenomenon didn't stop there.</p>
      <p>Nasa researchers observed the jugular veins of 11 astronauts on the ISS using ultrasounds.</p>
      <p>And in five of those 11 astronauts, blood flow in the jugular vein had stalled.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes it was sloshing back and forth a bit, but there was no net-forward movement," Ms Marshall-Goebel explained.</p>
      <p>The jugular vein is one of the most important parts of the body.</p>
      <p>It runs between the heart and the head, draining deoxygenated blood from the brain.</p>
      <p>This "draining" process is essential to reduce pressure in the brain.</p>
      <p>Stalled blood flow in veins is really rare, and is typically only seen in legs – often after long plane flights.</p>
      <p>Stagnant blood is a major concern because it can lead to clotting, which can cause more serious problems like damage to the lungs. Serious clotting can be fatal.</p>
      <p>Even more bizarrely, the blood in the jugular vein began moving in the opposite direction (from the heart towards the head) for two astronauts.</p>
      <p>NASA scientists described this as "extremely abnormal", and said that the blood may have switched directions due to a blockage.</p>
      <p>A similar phenomenon has been observed on Earth for patients with tumours that force blood to find a different route to the heart.</p>
      <p>"It's almost like a detour," explained Ms Marshall-Goebel.</p>
      <p>"When you're in your car and you sometimes have to go down the wrong street to get to where you need to go."</p>
      <p>This strange condition vanished when the astronauts returned to Earth.</p>
      <p>"None of the crew members actually had any negative clinical outcomes. I think it was probably scary for everybody.</p>
      <p>"But I think the fact that we found this now is really, really good news, because if you know this is a risk factor of spaceflight, it's something that you can monitor and prevent," concluded Ms Marshall-Goebel.</p>
      <p>A NASA spokesperson said the ISS "is equipped with appropriate treatments in the medical kit available to crew members".</p>
