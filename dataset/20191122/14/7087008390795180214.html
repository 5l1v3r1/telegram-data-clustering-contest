      <h1>Litecoin Price Analysis: LTC Fell Below $50, is $40 Next?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:54:08+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:54</time> by <a rel="author">Yaz Sheikh</a></address>
      <p>Litecoin saw a sharp price decline of around 12% over the past 24 hours and it currently trades at $46.34. LTC is now down by a total of 21% over the past week which is largely a result of Bitcoin dropping by 10% in a day. </p>
      <p>LTC remains the sixth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $2.96 billion.</p>
      <h3>Looking at the LTC/USD 1-Day Chart:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>LTC has plummetted pretty aggressively over the past 24 hours as it dropped below the support at $50 to reach the current support at $46.41. Litecoin has been on a bearish trend since late June as the cryptocurrency made fresh 9-month lows.</li>
        <li>From above: The nearest level of resistance lies at $50. Above this, resistance is located at $54 and $60. Higher resistance is expected at $64 (100-days EMA) and $70.80 (200-days EMA).</li>
        <li>From below: The nearest level of support lies at $44.31. Beneath this, support is found at $40 and $38.56 (downside 1.618 Fib Extension). The final level of support to highlight is located at $32.24.</li>
        <li>The trading volume remains pretty low, beneath the average for the year.</li>
        <li>The Stochastic RSI is in oversold conditions as we wait for a bullish crossover signal to send the market higher. For a sign that the selling pressure is fading, we will look for the RSI to start to climb higher toward the 50 level.</li>
      </ul>
