      <p>Mi Note 10 could launch soon in India, as per a report<br/>3.2 (64%) 5 votes</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Xiaomi launched the Mi CC9 Pro as the world’s first 108MP camera smartphone. The phone was also unveiled the very next day in Europe as Mi Note 10. And now, the company is planning to bring the device to India according to  a latest <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/mi-note-10-108mp-phone-india-launch-plans-exclusive/">report</a> by 91Mobiles. The handset is supposed to <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/21/mi-note-10-pro-heading-to-malaysia/">launch</a> in Malaysia next month. </p>
      <p>India is one of the key markets for Xiaomi since the company landed in the country. There have been many instances where the brand has launched products ‘Designed for India like the newly announced Mi Smart Band 3i. The firm never misses a chance to bring their best products to the country and therefore, why would they not launch the world’s first 108MP camera in the country where they lead in smartphones, smart TVs and wearables?</p>

      <p>According to 91Mobiles’ source, the top executives of Xiaomi are considering a launch of the standard Mi Note 10 in India. However, nothing assured can be said about the Pro variant. Previously, it was reported the phone will land in India alongside the all-screen Mi Mix Alpha in December. But that does not seem to be the case anymore as the launch may be delayed. Nevertheless, we can still expect the Mi Mix Alpha in limited quantities in India next month.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Manu Kumar Jain, Indian CEO and global VP of Xioami also teased a 100W fast-charging phone for 2020 launch. All we can say is exciting products are being lined up to land in India from different manufacturers starting early next year.</p>
