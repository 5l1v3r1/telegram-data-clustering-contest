      <p>A new supermarket has opened its doors in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/south-gloucestershire">South Gloucestershire</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/sainsburys">Sainsbury's</a> opened to the public in Lyde Green this morning and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/sainsburys-lyde-green-bristol-opening-3564002">will offer residents a range of grocery products and fresh foods</a>.</p>
      <p>The 4,024 sq ft convenience store has created 24 new jobs and will play an active role in the local community, according to a spokesperson.</p>
      <p>It offers a wide range of fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy products, an in-store bakery and other convenience products.</p>
      <p>It also has its own car park for customers to use.</p>
      <p>Local residents only had a small bakery in the village to buy their food items from before the launch, however nearby Emerson's Green is home to a huge Sainsbury's superstore.</p>
