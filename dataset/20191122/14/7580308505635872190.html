      <h1>Polio immunisation: Kano targets over 3m children -Commissioner</h1>

      <p>Kano state Commissioner for Health, Dr Aminu Tsanyawa, says the government has concluded arrangements to immunise more than N3 million children for the November round of Immunisation Plus Days.</p>
      <p>Tsanyawa made this known at a news briefing on Friday urging parents and guardians to ensure that their children were immunised so as to protect them from the Wild Polio Virus (WPV).</p>
      <p>He said the present administration had expended about N9 million in areas of mobilisation, training of personnel and other logistics to ensure the success of the exercise.</p>
      <p>“I am happy that Kano has not isolated any Wild Polio Virus (WPV) since 2014, and that was achieved because of the Polio Eradication Initiative over the years.</p>
      <p>“However, the state is at risk of infection from the neighboring states for long stretch borders with Jigawa and Katsina, high Population dynamics and seasonal migration,” the commissioner said.</p>
      <p>He lauded the Ganduje administration, development partners, the Emirate Councils, religious leaders and the media for their immense support towards polio eradication in the state.</p>
      <p>NAN reports that the November round of the Immunisation Plus Days would take off in 44 local government areas of the state on Nov. 23 and end on Nov. 26 simultaneously.</p>
