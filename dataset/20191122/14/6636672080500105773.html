        <b>Perhaps the most successful VC partnership in Silicon Valley was that between Eugene Kleiner and Tom Perkins to found what became Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Perkins describes in his book Valley Boy his first meeting with Kleiner which had been arranged by a mutual friend Sandy Robertson.</p>
      <p>“Gene admitted to me later that he was just as reluctant to meet as I had been to meet him,” writes Perkins, “our breakfast at Ricky’s Hyatt House El Camino in Palo Alto was arranged simply as a courtesy to Sandy, and neither of us expected the meeting to last more than thirty minutes.”</p>
      <p>”In appearance and temperament we couldn’t have been less similar. I have been characterized as being able to radiate tension by just walking into a room; this is among the kinder things said about my personality.”</p>
      <p>”Gene, on the other hand, was soothing and calm, portly but elegant in demeanor with a cultivated manner of speech. I often thought his would be the tone Sigmund Freud would have used with a patient on the couch.”</p>
      <p>“After Gene and I shared backgrounds over breakfast, we discussed our ideas for venture capital,” continued Perkins, “to our surprise, we discove that we were thinking along identical lines.”</p>
      <p>“The breakfast carried on through lunch and then to meetings at our respective homes. At the end of two days we decided that we complemented each other and that we should team up.”</p>
      <p>”With Gene’s assistance I wrote a prospectus for Kleiner &amp; Perkins. In rereading it now, some three decades later I am amazed at how clearly we foresaw our future and how closely we followed our formula.”</p>
      <p>”Our emphasis was on management of ven- tures, and we had a chapter called “Making It Happen,” detailing the differences between our approach and our competitors’. Another innovation was our “Investor’s Bill of Rights.” </p>
      <p>“Under our bill no profits, ever, could accrue to us, the general partners, until the investor’s capital had been returned in full.”</p>
      <p>”Further, all profits would be returned to the investors as they were achieved and not be reinvested in new opportunities.”</p>
      <p>”Thus the partnership would automatically run out of cash and would have to be renewed with a new partnership if the business was to continue.”</p>
      <p>”In this way the investors could see an end, and not be locked in for the indefinite future, and good money would not be invested after bad.”</p>
      <p>”To emphasize that aspect, we put a specific limit (eight years) on the life of the pool, so that it had to be wound up.”</p>
      <p>”Additionally, and this was both unique and very important, Gene and I were to be specifically proscribed from putting partnership money into anything in which we, personally, had an invest- ment, or an inside track.”</p>
      <p>”This corrected the practice, which we thought unethical, of putting investors into stocks for dollars per share that had already been purchased for pennies per share by the managing partners (this abuse was not uncommon at the time).”</p>
      <p>”Beyond this, we would invest in the partnership as limited partners, thereby putting us on exactly the same basis as all the investors.”</p>
      <p>”We would not, thus, cherry-pick for ourselves among any of the prospective ventures.”</p>
      <p>”And finally, we would not invest in anything whatso- ever that was within the remit of the partnership.”</p>
      <p>”In other words, we could not use the partnership as a sort of lighthouse to attract ventures that we then might take for ourselves.”</p>
