      <h2>Dele Alli exploded onto the scene at Tottenham, but his progress has stalled and he's lost his England place - now Jose Mourinho must get him back to his best</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p>When <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mauricio-pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino’s</a> sacking was announced on Tuesday night, the first <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> player to publicly offer thanks to the Argentine was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dele-alli">Dele Alli.</a></p>
      <p>The 23 year-old took to social media to pay tribute to the outgoing coach, to state: “I can’t thank this man enough.</p>
      <p>"He’s taught me so much and I’m so grateful for everything he’s done for me.</p>
      <p>“Good luck and hope to see you again my friend.”</p>
      <p>Alli joined Spurs in 2015 from MK Dons, having shone in League One for successive seasons. When other managers would have sent him out on loan, either to the Championship or a lower-tier Premier League side, Pochettino immediately counted on the then-teenager, something Alli clearly never forgot.</p>
      <p>That decision paid off handsomely, Alli growing, maturing and scoring 10 times that season, ending the campaign in England’s Euro 2016 squad.</p>
      <p>He was named PFA Young Player of the Year, doing so again in 2016-17, the season where he exploded, scoring 22 times in 50 games as Pochettino pushed him closer to the opposing goal.</p>

      <p>"In the box, he looks like a striker," said Pochettino declared. "And outside the box, he plays like a midfielder."</p>
      <p>In the last two seasons, gradually Pochettino pushed Alli towards the latter role, partly due to the increased output by Son Heung-min, partly out of the needs of the side as Mousa Dembele was slowed through injuries and then made his exit.</p>
      <p>Last term, Alli was often asked to sacrifice himself, operating deeper amid formation and personnel changes.</p>
      <p>He was hitting the penalty area, less and, while a mid-season thigh injury didn’t help, he ended the campaign with just seven goals in 38 games, with only five goals in the Premier League - by far his worst total.</p>
      <p>In three successive Premier League seasons, Alli's expected goals (xG) output, has progressively worsened: <i>12.39</i> (2016-17), <i>9.29</i> (17-18), <i>5.48</i> (18-19).</p>

      <p>Last term it was noticeable that he didn’t score in eight Champions League appearances, with Spurs’ run to the final owing more to the explosive performances of Son and Lucas Moura, who scored a semi-final hat-trick in Amsterdam to KO Ajax.</p>
      <p>Yes he has sacrificed, but you can't hide from the fact that the narrative has been one of underperformance. Perhaps you would expect more assists, but his expected assists (xA) in the Premier League last term was just 1.84; it was 7.25 the previous year.</p>
      <p>Again Alli began this season injured, and he is yet to play in a winning Spurs side, if you take out the thrashings of Red Star Belgrade.</p>
      <p>Overall he’s made 10 appearances, for just 747 minutes, scoring twice. In his 32 appearances for club and country in 2019, he has scored just three goals.</p>

      <p>With Alli also losing his England place, his career appears to have hit something of a wall and there are still questions over precisely what Alli is and where he should operate. That is a question to which Jose Mourinho must now find the answer.</p>
      <p>When the Portuguese took over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> in 2004, he immediately sought out Frank Lampard, telling him: “You are the best player in the world.”</p>
      <p>That boosted Lampard to the extent that he shone at Euro 2004 - scoring against France, Croatia and Portugal - before being the Blues’ top scorer with 19 in Mourinho’s title-winning debut season, as Mourinho adapted a system designed to get the best out of the now-Chelsea manager.</p>
      <p>With Harry Kane around, Mourinho doesn’t need Alli to be his main marksman, he just needs him to be the best version of himself, back to being the player capable of deciding big games, providing killer moments.</p>

      <p>Alli has proven himself to be tactically astute during his young career - even going back to playing as an anchorman in MK Dons’ three-man midfield at 16.</p>
      <p>He boasts an eye for goal and the kind of willingness to press that made Mourinho such a fan of not only Lampard, but also Oscar, the Brazilian who ousted Juan Mata during his second spell at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>There’s also a certain penchant for the dark arts that Alli and his new boss share. As Pochettino once put it: “Dele Alli is Dele Alli because he’s a little bit naughty."</p>
      <p>But now he needs more defined parameters, to get him back to doing what he did best, for his own good as much as that of his team.</p>
      <p>When Mourinho spoke to his new charges this week for the first time, he declared that he would "be your father, friend, girlfriend, whatever you want".</p>
      <p>He has already gone public about how highly he rates his current squad, and the faith he has in those he now finds at his disposal. Alli, despite the struggles of the last 12 months, is front and centre in that respect, and the pair have already spoken privately.</p>
      <p>If Mourinho can get Alli back to something like his old self it will help Spurs mount a top four challenge - they're currently 11 points back - not to mention Alli’s own hopes of reclaiming a Three Lions spot ahead of next summer’s Euros.</p>
