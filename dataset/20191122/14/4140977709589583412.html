            <b>CCC Vs JAM Dream11 : Jamaica look to challenge for a spot in the annuls of the points tally with a convincing win against Combined Colleges and Campuses today.</b>
          </p>
          <p>Combined Colleges and Campuses will just be wishing that the ongoing edition of the Super50 Cup comes to an end and with it helps them wrench out of their ordeal, something the side have failed to do on their own. Match after match, it’s been the same sordid story for the outfit with the team languishing and failing to string together even the two meaningful results till now to find themselves firmly planted in the deaths of Group A.</p>
          <p>Having won just the lone match in the six matches they have played in till now, the side come into today’s contest having lost four matches in succession. The 9 wicket win against Leeward Islands the last time around perfectly epitomised the peril of the side as they were not only ripped into but saw their gameplan being torn apart and thrown out of the window as they were comprehensively decimated and destroyed in that match.</p>

              <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146">
                <p>With the side being curbed for a mere 190 while batting first, their bowling performance was equally dire as Leeward Islands cantered their way to the score at hand with 9 overs in hand. And when they meet Jamaica today, their stinker of a form refuse to seize with the side up against an imperious and formidable opponent.</p>
                <p>Where CCC have lost four successive matches, Jamaica on the other hand come into the clash having not lost a match in their last four outings. The side have done extremely well for themselves to recover from what looked to be a fallout after losing their opening couple of matches with the team defeating Barbados by 26 runs as they defended their 331 to lay down a real marker. </p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>Chasing under the lights is a tricky task on this wicket with the wicket set to unravel as the match scrimmages, leading the team winning the toss opting to step out and bat first over here. The conditions in the first part of the clash are completely conducive for the bats, something the team winning the toss will be looking to capitalise on.</p>

                            <h3>CCC Vs JAM Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>With 142 runs in 5 matches for his side, Romaine Morrison has been in pristine touch for a Combined Colleges and Campuses side which has seen little go its way this season. If the side are to have any chance of making things jittery for their opponents in this one, he’ll need to resonate the same pulsating dsplays, something we entrust him to do in this clash.</p>
                            <h3>CCC Vs JAM Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>With 278 runs in 6 matches which include the one 100 and 50 to his name Assad Fudadin come in to find an immediate place in our Dream 11 setup of the day. The player has been in flawless and dependable touch, a player who has taken outright onus to come up with match wining knocks for his side to amass a flurry of runs.</p>
                            <p>He’s been accompanied perfectly by Nkrumah Bonner who leads the side when it comes to run scoring at the moment with the 338 runs in 6 matches to see him partner up Fudadin for the day with Jermaine Blackwood selected as well from the side to complete our picks for this segment.</p>
                            <h3>CCC Vs JAM Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>The 296 runs in 6 matches mean Jamaica’s Rovman Powell was always going to be the first name in this docket of our side. The player has feasted us to some stellar, quirky, vibrant and enigmatic knocks with the bat and with him set to get some time out with the ball as well, he makes for just the ideal all-rounder we go traversing for.</p>
                            <p>Dennis Bulli comes in as well from the unit whilst from Combined Colleges and Campuses we have selected Jarlarnie Seales for this one. The all-rounder is one of the safer picks from the side given his affinity to encapsulate his skill set with both the bat and ball and show fortitude in the face of adversary. </p>
                            <h3>CCC Vs JAM Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>Up infront of such a staunch and stalwart batting unit, if Combined Colleges and Campuses are going to have any chance of emerging as winners from this encounter, they’ll be requiring their spearhead Akeem Jordan to reverberate the same rousing displays he’s roped in till now. The bowler has stood tall amongst his counterparts with his 21 wickets in 8 matches seeing him wage a lone for the side.</p>
                            <p>Akshay Persaud comes in more so due to his cameos with the ball which have seen him rescue his side with some integral contributions down the lower middle-order to pick up 137 runs till now. From Jamaica meanwhile we have opted for the two players as well with Derval Green and Jami Merchant bringing an end to our Dream 11 side for the day.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Bonner comes in to captain our side while his counterpart Fudadin is being made the vice-captain.</p>
