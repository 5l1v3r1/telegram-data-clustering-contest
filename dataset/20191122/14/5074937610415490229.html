      <p>The amendment of the 243(1) which would be decided in the upcoming referendum by the electorate would mean that power to appoint MMDCEs would be taken from the president and given to the electorate based on Universal Adult Suffrage.</p>
      <p>Mr Akuffo said this referendum was  a platform to exhibit the spirit of patriotism and oneness among the beloved people of the Country.</p>

      <p>Mrs Asante-Obeng added that it was also to facilitate development through the implementation of key projects and programmes in the medium term development plans.</p>
      <p>“Let’s us all come out in our numbers to vote and approve the Article 55(3) of the amendment law”, she said.</p>
      <p>Mr Eric Ampadu Pabi, District Electoral Officer said it was a civic responsibility to go to the polls and vote come December 17.</p>
      <p>He said mostly electorate were not interested in District Level Elections, forgetting that it was the place by-laws were made.</p>
      <p>“If you feel to vote then you are not committed to your electoral area and unit”, he said.</p>
      <p>He cautioned the public that at the polls no verification, no vote would work and urged the public to take advantage of this year’s polls to vote positively come December 17.</p>
      <p>Citizens would also be required to vote either “YES”to support the participation of political party in the election of MMDCEs or “NO” to hold back the existing system.</p>
