      <p>It's been 17 days since Paul Lambert's men won 1-0 at Rochdale, with the majority of the team that played at Spotland having sat out subsequent cup ties against Lincoln (twice in the FA Cup) and Colchester (EFL Trophy).</p>
      <p>The hope is that key men return to action looking rested rather than rusty for two big home games in the space of four days - fifth-place Blackpool the visitors tomorrow afternoon, followed by new League One leaders Wycombe on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>"I feel like I haven't played in months! I can't wait to get back out there," said Downes, who was suspended for the win at Rochdale, then started the first match against Lincoln before playing twice for England Under-20s during the recent international break.</p>

      <p>"I played the full 90 against Portugal and then 20 minutes against Iceland, but that's a bit different to club football.</p>
      <p>"It's not as physical. When you're playing in the league you're playing against 30-year-old big geezers, but when you're playing for England it's against people your own age. It's more technical I'd say and obviously the atmosphere is a bit different."</p>

      <p>With Luke Chambers, Luke Woolfenden, Luke Garbutt, Cole Skuse, Jon Nolan, Kayden Jackson and James Norwood among those to have been rested for three straight knockout matches, Downes added: "We're ready to. We're raring to go. We'll be back at it again. From what I hear the boys have been training hard. We'll be good.</p>
      <p>"Me personally, I'm feeling good. I've been saying it for a while now that I need to add goals to my game and I feel like one is coming. I need that feeling again!"</p>

      <p>Asked if he wanted to have started the initial FA Cup clash with Lincoln two weeks ago, Downes replied: "Of course I would. I want to play every game. If the gaffer picks me for the next one (at Coventry) I'll be happy."</p>
      <p>And when quizzed as to whether the Blues can compete on three fronts this season, an EFL Trophy first round clash at Peterborough coming up, Downes said: "Yeah, why not? We've just got to take each game as it comes. Whether it's league or cup we've just got to go out there and try and get the wins.</p>
      <p>"These next two games are against two title challengers so it will be a big week."</p>
