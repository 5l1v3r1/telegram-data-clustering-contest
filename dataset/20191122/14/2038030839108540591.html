      <p>Cape Town - Growing up, we all had that one class we hated attending – and well, so did Queen Elizabeth!  </p>
      <p>While the 93-year-old is good at keeping herself well-composed publicly, when she was younger she disliked taking French lessons so much that one day she had an outburst, <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1205772/royal-family-news-queen-elizabeth-ii-queen-mother-buckingham-palace-david-cameron"><b>Express</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>According to a memoir written by the monarch’s late governess and educator, Marion Crawford, when the Queen was younger she could no longer contain her frustration with learning the language after she was forced to write an endless list of verbs.</p>
      <p>And while Queen Elizabeth is fluent in speaking French, during the strenuous exercise she decided to tip an inkpot over her head while no one was watching, according to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/22/the-royal-family-and-foreign-languages---in-60-seconds/"><b>The Telegraph</b></a>.</p>
      <p>"...Goaded by her boredom to violent measures, [she] had picked up a big ornamental silver inkpot and, without saying anything, tipped it over her own head," Marion recalled in the memoir.</p>
      <p>"There she sat, with ink trickling down her face and dyeing her golden curls blue."</p>
