      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:11:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/Mark%20Elibert" target="_blank">Mark Elibert</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53015/title.siriusxm-launches-wu-tang-the-saga-continues-podcast">Wu-Tang Clan</a> has been having a major year celebrating the 25th anniversary of their iconic debut album <i>Enter The Wu-Tang (36th</i> Chamber). To go along with the string of concerts and the Hulu series <i>Wu-Tang: An American Saga</i>, the legendary collective is making even bigger moves with a proposed Wu-Tang Clan theme park possibly on the way.</p>
      <p>In a feature for <a href="https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/11/from-his-worcester-storefront-jimmy-kang-is-helping-plan-a-wu-tang-theme-park-in-korea-while-working-as-vp-of-wu-tang-management.html">MassLive</a>, Vice President of Wu-Tang Management Jimmy Kang revealed he is in negotiations with officials out in Seoul, South Korea to construct a Wu-Tang Clan theme park.</p>
      <p>There’s no word on when the project will begin.</p>

      <p>Kang grew up in Worcester, MA and worked his way around the music industry owning a few clubs and starting his own label STR8UP Entertainment and Records. He landed his position with the Wu-Tang Clan after he met the RZA, Freedom, Divine, and other members of the Clan in 2010. According to Kang, the theme park holds a special place in his heart as his family emigrated from South Korea when he was a child.</p>
      <p>The iconic rap group’s influence has hit every corner of the globe and with this proposed theme park their influence will get stronger.</p>
