        <b>Our Weekend Best Bets podcast returns with selections and analysis covering horse racing, football, golf and snooker.</b>
      </p>
      <p>First up it's a weekend of head-to-heads in racing, as Altior and Cyrname clash at Ascot while Bristol De Mai takes on Lostintranslation at Haydock.</p>
      <p>Ben Linfoot and Matt Brocklebank sit on opposite sides of both fences, but it's reputations rather than readies on the line with both advising listeners to sit back and watch a pair of mouthwatering races.</p>
      <p>Worry not, however, as <i>LinBank </i>do expand the search to reveal their best racing bets before George Pitts takes you through the pick of Saturday's action in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Finally, Ben Coley finds one golfer hard to overlook in Dubai, while Richard Mann can barely hide his excitement ahead of snooker's UK Championship.</p>
