      <p>The Board of Trustee of the Peoples Democratic Party has set up a committee to look into concerns of its members in Edo, Lagos, Kano and other States.</p>
      <p>PDP BoT Chairman, Senator Walid Jibrin disclosed this while speaking with newsmen on Friday in Abuja on the outcome of the board Thursday’s meeting.</p>
      <p>Jibrin said that the BoT also formed various committees to assist in running the activities of the board.</p>
      <p>“We have instructed various committees to go into action especially the Committee on Peace and Conflict. We noted that there were so many complains in Edo, Kano, Lagos, and so on.</p>
      <p>“After the committee goes into action in finding out the true situation, we will now recommend and look at the matter solemnly before 2020,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>Jubrin said that the BoT also recommended to the National Working Committee to set up a committee to investigate what happened during Saturday’s governorship election in Kogi and Bayelsa States.</p>
      <p>“We viewed the accusations and counter-accusations among our members on the behaviours of some of our members in Kogi and Bayelsa States, especially those in Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>“We will not jump the gun. We have to make a thorough research before we come to the conclusion of who did what and suggest remedies.</p>
      <p>“Therefore we recommended to the NWC that a very serious investigation must take place,’’ he said.</p>
