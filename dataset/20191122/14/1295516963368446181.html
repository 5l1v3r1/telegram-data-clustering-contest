      <p>A variant cover for <i>X-Men/Fantastic Four </i>from Marvel's February 2020 solicitations showing Doctor Doom grabbing flowers in his fists hints that the Fantastic Four archenemy may have a major clash with the X-Men's new home, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/krakoa-the-x-men-living-island-base-plotting-takeover/">the sentient island Krakoa</a>. The <a href="https://www.cbr.com/x-men-fantastic-four-franklin-richards-mutant-agenda/">upcoming mini-series </a>will focus on what the ramifications of mutantkind leaving the human world for Krakoa in <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/powers-house-of-x-good-starting-point-for-new-x-men-readers/">Powers of X </a></i>and <i>House of X </i>have for Reed and Sue Richards' son, Franklin, an Omega-level mutant with the ability to warp reality.</p>
      <p><i>House of X #1 </i>and solicitations for <i>X-Men/Fantastic Four #1 </i>teased a confrontation between the X-Men and the Fantastic Four over the future of Franklin Richards, who as a mutant has birthright citizenship on Krakoa. However, the solicitations for <i>X-Men/Fantastic Four #2 </i>also suggested Dr. Doom will intervene in events, stating, "The world has been re-shaped by the X-MEN. But you can’t reshape a world without encountering its true master...DOOM."</p>

      <p>The vibrant flowers on the cover are likely <a href="https://www.cbr.com/x-men-fans-know-flowers-of-krakoa/">the flowers of Krakoa</a>. These plants have actually played an important role in writer Jonathan Hickman's new take on <i><a href="http://cbr.com/tag/x-men">X-Men</a>. </i>Not only do Krakoa's flowers have incredible medicinal properties, they can be used to create new physical landscapes on Krakoa. These properties make the flowers a natural target for Doctor Doom, although what role he will play in <i>X-Men/Fantastic Four </i>has yet to be shown.</p>
      <p><i>X-Men/Fantastic Four </i>is written by Chip Zdarsky (<i>Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man, Marvel Two-in-One</i>) with art by long-time <i>X-Men </i>artists, Terry and Rachel Dodson<i>.</i></p>
