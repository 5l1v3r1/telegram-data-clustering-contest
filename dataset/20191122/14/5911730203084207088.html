      <blockquote>This is our way of saying ‘thank you’ to Polk County citizens for their support of our deputies. In some communities around the country, you can find tension and mistrust between law enforcement and residents. Not here. We work hard with our communities to keep our neighborhoods, families, and children safe. We are honored to get so much support from so many people. Building relationships and connections in our neighborhoods is what we are all about. We literally could not have the success in fighting crime that we have without our communities' support. So, we know that there are families out there who are struggling financially and we want to do our small part to help out this Thanksgiving.</blockquote>
      <p>Sheriff Grady Judd</p>
      <p>The turkeys will be distributed one per family, one per vehicle on a first-come first-serve basis while supplies lasts.</p>
      <p>There will be no identification or pre-qualification to receive a turkey.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Judd said if there are any left over turkeys, they will donate them to the jail for the inmates.</p>
