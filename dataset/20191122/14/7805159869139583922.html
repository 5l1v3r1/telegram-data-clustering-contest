      <h1>OnePlus says some customers’ personal data may have been exposed in data breach</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:25:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/joefedewa/" target="_blank">Joe Fedewa</a></address>
      <p>Earlier today, OnePlus <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxWinebach/status/1197936274373525504">sent out emails</a> to inform customers of a security breach in the OnePlus Store. The email explains that payment information, passwords, and accounts are safe, however, names, contact numbers, email addresses, and shipping addresses may have been exposed. The company has now released a statement on its forums about the situation.</p>
      <p>OnePlus’ statement says “we have discovered that some of our users’ order information was accessed by an unauthorized party.” The company claims they took immediate steps to stop the intruder and notified users before making it public. They are currently “working with the relevant authorities to further investigate this incident.”</p>
      <p>If you have purchased something from the OnePlus Store in the past and you did not receive the email, your information is safe. Unfortunately, that means those who did receive the email may have had information exposed. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened to the company, either. Back in January of 2018, there was <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-investigating-credit-card-fraud/">credit card fraud</a> involving the Store’s payment portal.</p>
      <blockquote>We’ve inspected our website thoroughly to ensure that there are no similar security flaws. We are continually upgrading our security program – we are partnering with a world-renowned security platform next month, and will launch an official bug bounty program by the end of December.</blockquote>
