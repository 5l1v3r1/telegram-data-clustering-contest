      <p>Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson is expecting Premier League leaders Liverpool to be at full strength for Saturday’s match at Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp has injury concerns over full-back Andrew Robertson and Mo Salah prior to the clash in the capital, but the Eagles boss predicts the duo will feature.</p>
      <p>“We are counting on them playing so until such time when I pick up the team sheet and they are not playing, then I’ll think about it, but I think both will be fit to play,” Hodgson said.</p>
      <p>“I am presuming we will face what Jurgen Klopp has seen as his strongest team in recent weeks because I believe he has enough respect for us and what we are capable of doing not to make unnecessary changes if it is not forced upon him through injury.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool lead the table by eight points and are nine ahead of Manchester City after a 3-1 win over Pep Guardiola’s side two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>It resulted in some pundits suggesting the title race is over, but former Reds manager Hodgson is sure that is not the case.</p>
      <p>He added: “I think they’re in a great position and they must be very happy to be eight points clear after 12 games.</p>
      <p>“I believe it is 29 league games unbeaten so they’re on a fantastic run and I understand people tipping them to win the league to break a long duck.</p>
      <p>“They will understand there are a lot of games to go and I am certainly very anxious that we will make it very difficult for them. We aren’t going to sit back and help them win the title; we want to win the game.</p>
      <p>“We are fully prepared and fully ready for that and if we lose, it will be because they have played exceptionally well and we were unable to match them.”</p>
      <p>Hodgson has failed to beat Liverpool since taking over at Palace, although did push Klopp’s men close on two occasions last season.</p>
      <p>This match ends a horror set of fixtures which captain Luka Milivojevic described as a “mini-Champions League” run.</p>
      <p>While the south Londoners have only picked up one point from the games against City, Arsenal, Leicester and Chelsea, they are hoping to conclude it on a high point.</p>
      <p>“It is another tough game in what Luka has described as a ‘mini-Champions League’ and it’s been a tough run,” Hodgson admitted.</p>
      <p>“It’s unusual, I don’t think I can remember a time where I’ve actually played consecutively against all the top teams in the country, but that’s what the fixture list threw up.</p>
      <p>“We’re embracing the challenge of it all and up to now I can’t say we’ve done well in terms of the points we’ve collected, but I do think we’ve done reasonably well in terms of performances.”</p>
      <p>Palace will be boosted by a fully-fit squad ahead of facing Liverpool, with Joel Ward available after a groin injury suffered in the defeat at Chelsea and Wilfried Zaha able to shake off a foot problem.</p>
