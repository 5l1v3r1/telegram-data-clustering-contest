      <p>Graham Norton has landed a huge new gig as host of the <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/derry-girls-nicola-coughlan-baftas-dress-326507"><i>BAFTA</i></a> Film Awards next year.</p>
      <p>The TV chat show host will take over duties from Joanna Lumley for the 2020 ceremony on February 2, having overseen the event semi-regularly for the past 15 years.</p>
      <p>Lumley has hosted for the past two years after taking over from regular presenter Stephen Fry in 2018.</p>

      <p>"I'm delighted to be taking the helm of the biggest night in British Film, the audience at the Royal Albert Hall will be the biggest sofa I've ever faced," Graham told <a href="http://www.bafta.org/media-centre/press-releases/graham-norton-announced-as-host-for-ee-british-academy-film-awards-in"><i>Bafta.org</i></a>. "I'm honoured to be following in the fabulous footsteps of Stephen Fry and Joanna Lumley."</p>
      <p>Chief Executive of <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/revealed-2018-bafta-nominations-268232"><i>BAFTA</i></a>, Amanda Berry, added: "I am absolutely delighted that Graham Norton will host the EE British Academy Film Awards on Sunday February 2, 2020.</p>
      <p>"He will bring his brilliance and unique brand of humour to the role. The Film Awards is transmitted around the world, and those audiences know him too."</p>

      <p>Amanda added: "With Graham as our host I have no doubt we will deliver a very special celebration of the very best in film, and pay tribute to the most talented and creative people both in front of and behind the camera."</p>
      <p>Graham is, of course, best known for his BBC One chat show, though admitted ahead of the latest season that he still had doubts about himself.</p>
      <p>"I always get excited about returning to the chat show," he said. "Each time there's a slight sense of, 'Ooh can I still do this?' But then you see people on the sofa and the 600 people in the audience all geed up and you think, 'Actually, I don't suck at this job. There's a reason I've been doing it so long'. It's good to remind yourself of that occasionally."</p>
