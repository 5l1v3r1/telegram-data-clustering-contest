      <p>Nov. 22 (UPI) -- Hoda Kotb is sharing the secret behind her happy and active lifestyle.</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old television personality credited her daughters, Haley Joy, 2, and Hope Catherine, 7 months, with giving her energy during Thursday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuK1hc8VA3E">episode</a> of <i>Watch What Happens Live</i>.</p>
      <p>"Having kids at this phase of my life just made me excited about getting up and getting into it. I literally want to be healthy for the kids," Kotb said. "I get up, I do my thing. I think exercise in the middle of the day gives me more juice, so I try to do that."</p>
      <p>"I just think, 'Look, I get to go home. Haley can jump 5 feet, 9 inches, because she jumps into my arms,'" she added. "I hold her and I think, 'You know, what? Forget it. I don't even care about being tired. I slept for 54 years. Enough with the sleeping.' It's the best time of my life."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2019/08/20/Hoda-Kotb-to-return-to-Today-on-Sept-3-Im-so-excited/2361566308612/">Kotb returned</a> to <i>Today</i> in September after adopting Hope in April. She urged people to take full maternity leave if possible in an interview with People.</p>
      <p>"Work is incredibly important, but I do understand what my North Stars are now," the star said. "We can't take all the time we want. I get it. But I feel like if you can, and if you're at a point where you feel like you can do it, you should do it."</p>

      <p>On <i>WWHL</i>, Kotb also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuK1hc8VA3E">discussed</a> <i>Today</i>'s annual Halloween costumes. She said the cast doesn't get a say in what they wear, and said her and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kathie_Lee_Gifford/?tps=1">Kathie Lee Gifford</a>'s Snoopy and Woodstock costumes were the worst she's had.</p>
      <p>"That was the worst year we've ever had. That was the worst ever," the star said. "I had a big beagle [head]."</p>
      <p>"I feel like I'm always a man or something hideous. I was Yoda one year. I'm usually a man. I don't know why they keep picking me to do those things," she added.</p>
