      <p>Mumps is a contagious viral illness that is largely preventable via vaccination. Typically, it begins with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and loss of appetite, followed by swelling of the facial glands; the illness usually resolves on its own. Mumps is highly infectious and is transmitted by respiratory droplets and direct contact. The highest rate of infectivity is present immediately before the onset of the facial gland swelling.</p>
      <p>There is no specific antiviral therapy for treatment of mumps, however mumps can be prevented with adequate immunization.</p>
      <p>Students that have received 2 previous MMR vaccines can still be at risk for contracting mumps. So, for students that have come in contact with an individual with or suspected mumps, a 3rd MMR vaccine may be indicated to help prevent the spread of mumps.</p>
      <p>Students who wish to receive the MMR vaccine or would like additional information should contact the Drexel Student Health Center. Students that believe they may have been exposed or are having symptoms consistent with mumps should come to the Student Health Center for further evaluation. Students that have been seen by another physician and told they may have mumps should call 215.220.4700 to report.</p>
