      <h1>Morgana, arguably the best Persona 5 character, rips in Persona 5 Scramble</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:30</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Carter</a></address>
      <p>The <i>Persona </i>series has such a rich tapestry of characters that you could probably argue all day over who your own individual favorites are, but as a cat owner at heart, Morgana really hit home in <i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-persona-5-424076.phtml">Persona 5</a></i>. The fact that he can transform into all sorts of wacky configurations is just the cherry on top.</p>
      <p>Morgana is bringing that madness into <i>Persona 5 Scramble</i>, the new <i>Musou</i>-like game arriving in Japan this February on PS4 and Switch. I say "<i>Musou</i>-like" because it really looks like it's shaking up the formula with a bit of <i>Persona</i> madness, especially with characters like Morgana and the titular Personas. His trademark humor also made it in, baka!</p>
      <p>Call me crazy, but <i>Scramble </i>even seems import worthy, which will be super easy to do on the PS4 and Switch, which are both region-free. I don't know if I want to wait for a localization announcement and the eventual release!</p>
      <p>Now that I think about it: let's do this. Throw down on your favorite <i>Persona 5</i> party member below.</p>
