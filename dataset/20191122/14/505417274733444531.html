      <p>Two set-piece first-half goals from central defenders plus a late strike helped capture the Irish Universities Harding Cup, the first year’s main cup, for UCD with a hard-earned 3-0 win over Maynooth University in the final at Queen’s University Belfast.</p>

      <p>After surviving strong Maynooth pressure in the opening period, with good effort from Abdulrasaq Alamu-Tajudeen and Eoin O’Neill  both kept out by Cormac Henry’s excellent saves, Harvey O’Brien turned in a well-delivered Ciaran Behan corner on 35 minutes.</p>
      <p>Minutes later, his centre half partner Tom O’Connor headed home another fine Behan corner for a 2-0 interval lead.</p>
      <p>Prior to the second goal, UCD lost influential winger Liam Kerrigan to a nasty injury in a badly mistimed tackle and after a lengthy period of treatment, he was replaced by Joe Carmody.</p>
      <p>Maynooth looked to get back into the game after the break and a strong second half-performance saw shots from O’Neill and Leon Kennedy both denied by top-class saves from the UCD keeper.</p>
      <p>The win was finally wrapped up in the closing minutes with top scorer Colm Whelan’s brilliant finish beating Malachy Doyle following a neat one-two with Behan.</p>
      <p>It’s the twentieth Harding Cup win for UCD in the 30-year history of the competition and their first since 2016.</p>
      <p>UCC Soccer were crowned Spillane Cup winners.</p>
