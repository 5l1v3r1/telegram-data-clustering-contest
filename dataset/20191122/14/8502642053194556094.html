      <p>CHICAGO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Following are U.S. trade expectations for the opening of grain and soy complex trading at the Chicago Board of Trade at 8:30 a.m. CST (1430 GMT) on Friday.</p>
      <p>WHEAT - Up 2 cents to 3 cents per bushel</p>
      <p>* End-of-week short-covering bounce expected after most active CBOT soft red winter wheat contract fell 1.3% on Thursday.</p>
      <p>* Benchmark CBOT December soft red winter wheat contract rose above its 20-day moving average but hit resistance at its 30-day moving average during the overnight trading session.</p>
      <p>* Most-active wheat contract has risen 2.2% so far this week. It has posted weekly losses in the four previous weeks.</p>
      <p>* CBOT December soft red winter wheat last traded up 2-1/2 cents at $5.11-1/2 per bushel. K.C. December hard red winter wheat was last up 2 cents at $4.23, and MGEX December spring wheat was last up 1/4 cent at $4.95-1/2.</p>
      <p>CORN - Down 1 to 2 cents per bushel</p>
      <p>* Choppy, range bound trade expected. Strength in wheat supportive but signs of weakness in the cash market, demand concerns add pressure.</p>
      <p>* Most-active corn futures contract has fallen 1.0% so far this week, on track for third straight weekly loss and the fifth in the last six weeks.</p>
      <p>* CBOT December corn last traded down 1 cent at $3.67-1/2 per bushel.</p>
      <p>SOYBEANS - Down 1 cent to 2 cents per bushel</p>
      <p>* Soybeans under pressure from concerns about potential trade deal between the United States and China. Most-active soybean futures contract slipped to lowest on a continuous basis since Sept. 30 during overnight trading.</p>
      <p>* China wants to work out an initial trade pact with the United States and has been trying to avoid a trade war, President Xi Jinping said on Friday, but is not afraid to retaliate when necessary.</p>
      <p>* Traders watching to see if benchmark CBOT January soybean futures contract can hold support above the low end of 20-day Bollinger range overnight.</p>
      <p>* Most-active contract on track for a weekly loss of 2.0%, which would be its third weekly decline in a row and its biggest in three months.</p>
      <p>* CBOT January soybeans last traded down 1 cent at $9.00 per bushel. (Reporting by Mark Weinraub; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)</p>
