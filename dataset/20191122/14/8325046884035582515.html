      <p>In a galaxy not so far away, Porsche has debuted the first product from its foray into the fully electric sports car market.</p>
      <p>The German luxury car maker’s four-door Taycan was unveiled – with the help of Stormtroopers, no less – for the first time in Asia Pacific at Singapore’s The Float @ Marina Bay on Thursday (Nov 22) night.</p>
      <p>Slated for launch in August 2020, three variants of the Taycan have already been announced so far. Prices excluding COE are expected to start from around S$500,000 for the Taycan 4S, <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/hub/bt-motoring/porsche-taycan-takes-its-singapore-bow">The Business Times (BT)</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The Taycan Turbo will cost roughly S$650,000, while the prime Taycan Turbo S will start at around S$750,000, BT added.</p>
      <p>The automobile giant’s landmark battery-electric vehicle (BEV) is the first production vehicle to have a system voltage of 800 volts, instead of the typical 400 volts for electric cars.</p>
      <p>Its battery can reach a range of up to 100 km with a single charge of just over five minutes on a high-power charging network, Porsche said. It will take just 22.5 minutes of charge time for a Taycan battery on 5 per cent state-of-charge (SoC) to reach up to 80 per cent SoC under “ideal conditions”.</p>
      <p>Both the Turbo and Turbo S come with Porsche’s 93.4 kWh capacity Performance Battery Plus, will also be available on the 4S – which comes with a 79.2kWh battery pack – as an option.</p>

      <p>The Taycan Turbo S boasts a 761 horsepower (hp), enabling it to accelerate from 0-100km/h in 2.8 seconds, while the more basic Taycan Turbo has a 680hp that does the same in 3.2 seconds.</p>
      <p>On a full charge, the Taycan Turbo S can travel up to 412km, while the Taycan Turbo has a range of up to 450km, nearly as far as many petrol cars can travel.</p>
      <p>Additionally, both Turbo models have electric machines placed on both the front and rear axles, and can reach a top speed of 260 km/h.</p>

        <b>From electric cars to Starships?</b>
      </p>
      <p>At the same event, Porsche also revealed sketches of the newest Starship designed for the upcoming movie, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.</p>
      <p>A collaboration with Lucasfilm, the new Starship was designed by designers on both teams.</p>

      <p>“The basic challenge of the design brief was to design a Starship that would both be true to the Star Wars universe and Porsche design DNA,” Doug Chiang, Lucasfilm’s vice president executive creative director, said.</p>
