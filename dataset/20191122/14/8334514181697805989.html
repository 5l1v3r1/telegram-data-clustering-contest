      <p>The protesters say the situation in the home results from years of corruption and nepotism that have plagued Bosnia since a 1992-5 war left the former Yugoslav republic split into two autonomous parts with layers of ethnically-based government.</p>
      <p>Police on Friday raided the home, which had been under scrutiny for months over suspected historic financial misconduct, a day after the Sarajevo cantonal prosecutor’s office opened a case relating to the alleged abuses.</p>
      <p>The government of the Bosniak-Croat Federation, which makes up Bosnia along with a Serb republic, said it had ordered the dismissal of the home’s general manager and managing and supervisory board and their replacement by professionals.</p>
      <p>“As a minister, I am shocked by facts and allegations that have been presented, especially because they relate to the children with mental problems, a vulnerable category that must have special protection,” Federation Labour and Social Policy Minister Vesko Drljaca told a news conference.</p>
      <p>The government also ordered health and labor ministries to tackle systemic flaws in the running of the region’s care homes.</p>
      <p>Cudic, of the Nasa Stranka party, had told the Bosniak-Croat parliament 27 out of 149 employees at the home were economists rather than trained carers, and only one person covered night shifts, often without medical training.</p>
      <p>She described conditions at the home as “modern-day slavery”, saying she had evidence some workers and patients were forced to work for the previous manager at his private home.</p>
      <p>That manager has not commented publicly on the allegations. His successor denied any wrongdoing and the minister, Drljaca said: “All information needs to be thoroughly examined and measures taken to determine the real truth.”</p>
      <p>The protesters vowed to continue their action next week to press for a better social care network with tighter supervision.</p>
      <p>“Professionals rather than party affiliates should deal with our children,” said Edo Celebic from an association of parents of children with special needs.</p>
      <p>Bosnia’s ombudsmen said the sector badly needed attention.</p>
      <p>“It is super-urgent to address the problems of inadequate staffing and accommodation, of supervision of employees and insufficient financial means,” lead ombudsman Nives Jukic told a news conference in the town of Banja Luka on Friday.</p>
