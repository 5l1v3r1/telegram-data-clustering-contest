      <p>Businesses in Zimbabwe were left in a fix on Friday after <a href="https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL8N2822QY">Government announced a policy to force importers to declare sources of their foreign currency</a> when declaring their goods for customs duty. Failure to prove you obtained your money from the bank will result in the State forfeiting your goods.</p>

      <p>The shock Policy was announced on Friday by Deputy Finance Minister Clemence Chiduwa and was justified as a means to tame the black market for United States Dollars. Companies have been blamed for the high demand for forex and driving the exchange rate to over ZWL20+ to the dollar at the time of publication. Forex has been in short supply from banks in Zimbabwe leading to businesses turning to the black market when they need to restock.<a href="https://iharare.com/watch-rbz-addresses-allegations-that-it-is-supplying-black-market-in-exclusive-conference/"> According to Chiduwa, the practice of indexing prices to the US Dollar was driving inflation</a>.</p>
      <p>“In the event that you are not able to declare the official source of foreign currency, you forfeit whatever you have to the state. So this will deal with black market operations,”</p>
      <p>Only time will tell if the new policy shift will curb demand for Greenbacks.</p>
