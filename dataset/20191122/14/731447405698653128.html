      <p>A new film about the 2018 Georgian <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/news/41730">club raids</a> and ensuing <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/news/41732">protest raves</a> will screen next week at the <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/club.aspx?id=3875">Tate Modern</a> in London. <br/><br/>Stephan Polivanov's first-ever feature film, <i>Raving Riot</i>, explores the so-called "raveolution" "beyond the <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/news/41804">news</a> and beautiful pictures," he says. He'll participate in a discussion and Q&amp;A session following the screening on Friday, November 29th, at 7 PM, as part of the November edition of Tate Lates. (Find more details about the event <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/film/stepan-polivanov-raving-riot">here</a>.) <br/><br/>"We decided to make a movie... explor[ing] the generation that made that protest possible," Polivanov says. "This is a coming-of-age story of people who have become aware of themselves being a political force and having a voice, but do not yet understand what to do with it." <br/><br/>Watch the trailer for <i>Raving Riot</i>.</p>
