      <p>The small planet in the galaxy far far away, was spotted by a hawk-eyed Reddit user on an official Star Wars galaxy map.</p>
      <p>Phooka12 on Reddit said in a post, "Meanwhile in a galaxy far away", with a photo of the Star Wars Universe and an arrow pointing at Drogheda.</p>
      <p>The secret planet can be found in the 'Teraab' section of the universe around the Mid Rim in grid Q11.</p>
      <p>Surrounding planets include Pesmenben, Dica, and the more commonly known Ruusan where the Sith Lords were created.</p>
      <p>The planet is described as having a "moderately warm" climate covered in forests and mountains, according to fan made website 'Wookieepedia'.</p>
