      <p>Controversial blogger Kemi Olunloyo has alleged that former BBNaija housemate <a href="http://concisenews.global/entertainment/">Tacha</a> Akide described her as ‘ex-convict who needs therapy’ in a message on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Olunloyo claimed she was able to detect that Tacha sent her the message because her (Tacha) location was turned on.</p>
      <p>According to her, she was able to track Tacha the same way Instagram tracked the newstip that sent her to prison.</p>
      <p>The message sent to her read: “All you couldn’t achieve for over 50years on Earth, Tacha has achieved it at just 23, so yes, you need to be mad. Ex convict you need therapy. I care about you Mrs ex convict that’s why I’m telling you. You are so jobless with no shame at all.”</p>
      <p>In her reaction, Olunloyo said: “Remember IG is a phone app. Tacha has BLOCKED ME on Instagram and Twitter on orders of her manager @teebillz323. I’m really crying my eyes out now that I can’t comment on her post. The fact remains that Industry people are waiting for her to FAIL woefully with Tunji.</p>

      <p>“I never wish bad luck on anyone but sources inside Akide’s camp said they did not like how I was skooling her up and down about drunk driving, endorsement versus partnership advert yesterday. Tunji is not enlightened on these things and it’s making her look bad.</p>
      <p>“You are not making money, you should be! People around you are making YOUR money. Why haven’t I seen you on a single TV appearance or MSM???</p>
      <p>“Look how long it took Tunji to unravel your partnership with Ciroc. Look at Mercy’s video produced by Elo in a bar scene. Alcohol delivered to your door in a nightie versus Classy Mercy walking into a bar. I love you both. Only interested in taking you both International.</p>
      <p>“Go ask Naira Marley’s team on how you they got FREE PR tips from me. See him everywhere now. Finally clear your TOXIC fans and tell them love speaks love leads.”</p>
