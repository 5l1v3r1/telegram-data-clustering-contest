      <p>Now he's confirmed he's going to be flying Down Under to support Jacqueline and so he can see her as soon as she gets out.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10400532/dan-osborne-flying-australia-jacqueline-jossa-tearful-meltdown/">The Sun Online</a> : "I'll be going out there though, not to go into the jungle but to support Jac."</p>
      <p>As well as looking after the couple's two daughters, Ella and Mia, while the actress is away, Dan has also been doing some DIY.</p>
      <p>He's been busy turning the couple's garage into a gym where he can work out and hopes to have it finished by the time she gets home.</p>

      <p>Earlier this week, Dan revealed he's been surviving on takeaways since his wife left for Australia.</p>
      <p>He confessed he's not been eating well since Jacqueline left and has been making do with takeaway dinners.</p>
      <p>During a video posted on Wednesday night, he said: "Tonight's meal is an Indian so as you can see from the last few days my diet is terrible.</p>
      <p>"We're getting a curry."</p>
      <p>Dan has been watching the show every night and posting his reactions on social media.</p>
      <p>However, this could leave him red-faced if his own antics get brought up on TV.</p>

      <p>There's growing speculation that Dan's alleged affair with Love Island star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a> is going to be mentioned in camp.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline is in there with Myles Stephenson, who dated Gabby after she was rumoured to have grown close to Dan backin 2018.</p>
      <p>Reports suggest the campmates are going to end up chatting about their love lives - with Dan and Gabby likely to be brought up.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-dan-osborne-towie-fame-13054898">Dan</a> and Jacqueline married in 2017 - but in April the year after, he was spotted getting close to Gabby while they were filming a TV show in Spain.</p>
      <p>Both parties denied anything happened, but Jacqueline was furious and even texted Gabby: "Did you sleep with my husband?"</p>
      <p>Now it's thought that Myles and Jacqueline will have a talk in camp - and he'll be willing to spill the beans on what Gabby told him.</p>
