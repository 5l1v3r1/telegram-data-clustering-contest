      <p>The Regional District of Okanagan Similkameen has batted the ball back into the Agricultural Land Commission’s field and will submit an application to legalize the Keogan baseball diamonds in Okanagan Falls. </p>
      <p>The ALC issued the RDOS<a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/270651/baseball-diamond-on-move"> a notice of breach</a> in July after inspectors visited the fields, which are on ALR land, in response to complaints from a neighbour over foul balls and “disrespectful” users.</p>
      <p>When the ALC approved the ball fields in 2004, it set out criteria for their orientation to avoid conflict with neighbours, a criteria that was not utilized. It also required a site plan be provided to the ALC before construction in 2007, something that never happened. </p>
      <p>On Thursday, the RDOS board voted to submit a non-farm-use application to have the fields legalized. The application was one of four options provided to the RDOS by the ALC in the July breach notice. The alternatives were field re-orientation, removal or the installation of nets. </p>
      <p>OK Falls RDOS director Ron Obirek told Castanet the issue has sparked major angst in the community, resulting in some “pretty harsh” letters to the regional district by voters. </p>
      <p>Obirek said residents should not be upset with the neighbour that lodged the complaints about the foul balls. </p>
      <p>“Her concern is fair. Very reasonable, very legitimate,” he said. “She’s afraid that if a ball hits one of her children or somebody else, it could do harm.”</p>
      <p>Obirek said its not clear how the ALC will respond to the non-farm-use application, but it will provide the RDOS a more clear picture of the next steps required. </p>
      <p>“Bottom line… there is a mistake, and there is going to be a cost of attending to it.”</p>
      <p>The draft 2020 Okanagan Falls Parks and Recreation budget has a $12,000 line for removal or mitigation measures at Centennial Field, although Obirek said that's a placeholder and very rough staff estimate.</p>
      <p>Obirek suggested residents outraged by the situation consider how little the ball fields have been utilized in recent years, pointing to declining enrollment at the local elementary school </p>
      <p>“We don’t have a lot of kids playing ball,” he said. “People became angry about the baseball diamond not getting used because someone complained. Well if they didn’t complain, it's still not getting used.”</p>
      <p>Obirek added a reorientation of the fields could be used an opportunity to upgrade them to standards that would allow the South Okanagan Minor Baseball Association, which is always looking for field space, to use them.</p>
      <p>That would bring people to OK Falls, he said, and in the case of a tournament they may stay for a full weekend.</p>
