      <h2>LFC Stories: The latest instalment of our Red Letters series as the duo discuss the romance of watching Liverpool and Crystal Palace</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:18:56+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:18</time> by <a rel="author">Michael MacCambridge, Neil Atkinson</a></address>
      <p>Welcome to Red Letters.</p>
      <p>Football, soccer, is a truly global game. It is also a game which means so much more than 22 players on the pitch and the two managers in the dugout. For 90 minutes at a time, this is what matters most, but surrounding that is culture, identity, and relationships.</p>
      <p>To be a part of a club can often mean to be part of a family, a kinship, which only a small percentage in this world can experience. On the field, the collective and the individual combine to bring success. The same happens with supporters. It is a true collective game, where it is easy to feel as one with thousands of others; it is also individual, where the emotions you feel are your emotions, the experiences you feel are your experiences, and nobody else can understand.</p>
      <p>Over the course of the 2019/20 season, two Liverpool fans, friends, will write to each other about those emotions and experiences. Michael MacCambridge, born, raised and living in the United States, is a best-selling author and journalist. Most importantly, he is a Liverpool fan, and can often be found watching the games at his local supporters' club.</p>
      <p>His friend Neil Atkinson, born, raised and living in Liverpool, is the host of worldwide podcast phenomenon The Anfield Wrap. He, too, supports Liverpool, and has been a season ticket holder for 20 years.</p>
      <p>Separated by the Atlantic Ocean, but brought together by a passion much stronger, this is their correspondence throughout the campaign, as they share their highs, lows, hopes and fears around Liverpool FC on a regular basis, as well as what it is to simply be part of their community following Jurgen Klopp and his side. </p>
      <p>We are fortunate enough to have access to everything they write. We hope you enjoy.</p>
      <p>Best,</p>

        <b>21 November 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dear Neil,</p>
      <p>I was delighted to receive your dispatch from Tokyo. Brockle’s logic, however counterintuitive, is once again irrefutable.</p>
      <p>It was the rare relaxing autumn weekend here. No Liverpool game, no Chiefs game (they didn’t play until Monday night, in Mexico City), so I saw <i>Ford v. Ferrari</i>, played tennis, attended my monthly poker game, did some research on a new book idea, made peanut-butter cookies with my son, listened to a lot of <i>Wes Montgomery </i>- <i>Complete Live in Paris 1965, </i>and started reading Susan Orlean’s <i>The Library Book</i>, which is brilliant.</p>
      <p>But even when there aren’t games, the Reds are never far from my mind (is Joe’s knee okay?; are Mo and Andy’s ankles healing?; is everything all right with Big Virg and his ‘personal reasons’?).</p>
      <p>The tale of your Japanese exploits and middle-of-the-night viewing got me thinking, once again, about the level of our collective obsession, and about a trip I took 25 years ago this month, before I fell in love with Liverpool FC…</p>
      <p>•</p>
      <p>In the summer of 1994, I got engaged. I was 31 years old, and working as the film critic at the daily newspaper in Austin. My fiancée was a few years older, a composed, cultured woman who enjoyed music and movies, and had exquisite taste in interiors — we’d been cohabiting for a year by then, and our living room looked like a Pottery Barn showroom.</p>
      <p>That year, a couple of friends invited us along on a trip to Italy in November. When the topic was first brought up, I explained that while I would love to see Italy, and would love to travel with my fiancée and our friends, such a trip would violate my longtime opposition to leaving the country during football season. Which is when Danica suggested, with a vaguely exasperated look, that perhaps it was now time for me to be an adult and concede that the football season could proceed without my direct supervision.</p>
      <p>So we compromised. I agreed to take the trip in mid-November, but only if we could go from Wednesday to Wednesday, so I’d miss just a single weekend of games.</p>
      <p>Then I began to make preparations (much more complicated in the un-wired, pre-streaming ‘90s). I couldn’t simply set my VCR to record the big showdown between the Chiefs and the division-leading Chargers, because it wouldn’t be telecast locally in Austin. I called my high school friend, Greg, in Kansas City, and he agreed to tape the telecast that Sunday, then FedEx the videocassette to me on Monday, for Tuesday delivery. The NFL was still an unknown entity throughout Italy, much less rural Umbria, so I wouldn’t have to worry about reading about the game in an Italian newspaper (which I wouldn’t be able to read at any rate). The plan was simply that I’d “stay dark” throughout the week, assiduously avoid the <i>International Herald Tribune </i>during our time in Italy, ignore all the newsstands during our return layover in Chicago, and watch the game on Wednesday evening, as soon as I arrived home. With that elaborate plan in place, I knew I could spend a week in Italy secure in the knowledge that my game would be waiting for me when I got home.</p>
      <p>That sorted, off we went. We landed in Florence, and stayed in southern Umbria, in a modest cottage a few miles outside of a village called Spedalicchio. It was a sublime time: beautiful days, chilly nights, long walks, endless delicious food and drink. That Sunday, we went spent the day in Siena, and I bought some rich, luscious Italian stationery. We had the sort of immense, multi-course dinner for which Italy is justly famous, where the men theatrically loosen their belts a notch or two as they get up from the table. Then we started back on the 90-minute drive to our cottage, with plans to open a bottle of wine and have a nightcap by the fireplace.</p>
      <p>In my memory, it was about 10 o’clock when we got on the road. My friend, Robert, was driving and I was riding shotgun, the women were in the back. While Robert negotiated the dark patches, spotty signage, and switchback turns of the Italian countryside, he asked me to find something on the radio. As I was working my way through the dog’s breakfast of competing signals, trying to find anything intelligible, I switched between what sounded like a German economic program and a bad Europop song, and then overheard the faint sound of a crowd, and distinctly American voices. Then, as I delicately moved the dial into the best spot to pick up the static-filled signal, I heard: “<i>Montana, hands to Allen, up the middle for three yards</i>.”</p>
      <p>It was a game.</p>
      <p>It was an American football game.</p>
      <p>It was <i>my</i> football game.</p>
      <p>There, in the middle of the Italian countryside, we had — entirely by happenstance — stumbled upon the Armed Forces Network broadcast of the Mutual Radio Game of the Week, between the San Diego Chargers and the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>
      <p>I hadn’t been looking for it. It had never occurred to me to hope to find it, because I never knew such a thing existed. But here, as if by divine providence, was my game. I looked around the car with wide eyes. <i>Wasn’t this amazing? </i>(I seem to recall that at least one of the other people in the car rolled their eyes.)</p>
      <p>The news only got better. The Chiefs were up 13-0 in the second half. By the time we got back to the cottage, the third quarter was almost over. I assumed that everyone knew — and understood, and accepted, and supported — that I was going to be late to the fireplace for the nightcap. Barb laughed, Robert smiled, my fiancée sighed, and they all went inside while I sat in the little Fiat, on a hill in rural Italy, listening to the rest of the game.</p>
      <p>The Chiefs had stopped the Chargers, forcing a punt. We were about to get the ball, and a 13-point lead, at home, late in the third quarter, with the immortal Joe Montana at quarterback. I won’t punish you with all the gruesome details, but the Chiefs committed a rare roughing-the-punter penalty, allowing San Diego to keep possession, and the Chargers scored on a deep pass one play later. Suddenly it was 13-7.</p>
      <p>The fourth quarter was forty-five minutes of slow death. The signal faded in and out, so it felt like I missed the details of every other play. The Chiefs gave up another touchdown to fall behind by a point. On this day, Montana wasn’t able to rally the team, and the game ended with the Chargers winning, 14-13. Instead of the Chiefs being tied for the division lead, now the Chargers stood two games ahead, owning the tiebreaker, poised to sew up the division, which they would do a few weeks later.</p>
      <p>Only one team can win the championship, which means that each season, there is a game that presents fans of almost every other team with the incontrovertible evidence that, “This is not going to be our year.” For Chiefs’ fans, this was that game.</p>
      <p>Sitting in the Fiat, I sagged, and rested my head for a minute on the steering wheel. I turned the car off, took the keys, and trudged toward the cottage. The rest of the group was by the fireplace, well into the wine, laughing and telling stories. I stopped at the doorway to the living room, a crestfallen look on my face; I apologized again for missing out, gave the final score as though delivering the news of a relative’s death, and said I thought it would be best if I went upstairs and retired for the evening.</p>
      <p>But that wasn’t the most difficult part.</p>
      <p>That came later, when my fiancée joined me upstairs, clearly disappointed in my going missing for the remainder of the evening. In the spirit of mutual understanding, I tried to explain that though the result sent me into a funk, and though I realized my insistence on listening to the game marred the end of the evening for my friends — and while I was genuinely sorry about all of that — I was still <i>grateful</i> to have suddenly had the opportunity to listen to the game live. That there was something magical in that hour, in that unexpected sense of connection, and the surreal act of listening to an NFL game on the top of a hill in rural Italy.</p>
      <p>I was met with a blank stare, at which point the thought occurred to me that this had probably not been the ideal time to deliver that explanation.</p>
      <p>That was 25 years ago, and I look back on that entire occasion somewhat sheepishly. I’m happy to report that I am in many ways more mature now, and as the divorced father of two young adults, I have a greater sense of perspective, a better grasp on the things that are really important. I hope that, when the inevitable happens at some point, and I have to next miss a game, I will handle that with equanimity. But it’s also true that there are now <i>two</i> teams whose games I’ll go to great lengths to avoid missing, if humanly possible, and that this can be a complicating factor in the lives of my friends and family.</p>
      <p>We have both made the point, in past missives, about remembering that our obsessions are actually a choice. But at the time back in ’94, listening to the game in the Fiat didn’t feel like a choice so much as an expression of devotion — it was part of my identity. I felt like I <i>had</i> to stay in the car, because I couldn’t bear to be the sort of fan who, when gifted with a surprise live broadcast of his team’s game 5,725 miles away, ignored it and went in from a nice glass of Tempranillo.</p>
      <p>This, of course, raises all sorts of vexing questions, such as: Were my priorities completely out of whack? Was I more devoted to my team than my fiancée and my friends?</p>
      <p>The answer seems patently obvious. It wasn’t that my team was more important than my friends (I was in Italy with them, after all). But my team was playing <i>then, </i>and in that moment, the chance to hear the game live seemed like a rare gift.</p>
      <p>The thought has occurred, more than once over the past 25 years: what if the same circumstances were to occur again today? If I’m being honest, I think I would be out in the Fiat again, listening to the end of the game. But then, after absorbing that heartbreaking loss, I’m pretty sure I would persevere, maybe stop in the bathroom to splash cold water on my face, then join my loved ones for a drink by the fireplace.</p>
      <p>I think that’s called progress.</p>
      <p>I bring this all up for two reasons. Firstly, it’s worth remembering how much has changed in a generation, and that NFL fans in Europe and Premier League fans in the US now take pretty much for granted the ability to watch whatever games they want, whenever they’re taking place and wherever they might be.</p>
      <p>Secondly, because I have admired your ability to be relatively sanguine about having to miss the occasional game, I wonder: Has your view on the value of being there in the moment evolved at all over the years? Or, to put it another way, did you ever even consider <i>not </i>being up in the middle of the night in Tokyo to watch LFC?</p>
      <p>•</p>
      <p>Back to the present. Now we turn our attention to the brutal stretch ahead. By my count, Liverpool have 17 games in the next 50 days — which works out to a game every 2.94 days over a seven-week period. Even if you send out the academy kids for the domestic cup competitions, and start a load of squad players in the opener of the Club World Cup, it’s still a punishing stretch.</p>
      <p>And I would submit to you that we won’t <i>really </i>know how we’ve endured it all until a month or two later, once we get through the rest of January and February. And so: One game at a time. It was ever thus.</p>
      <p>I want to hear all about Seoul. I read with interest your note about South Korea having the highest rate of hard-alcohol consumption in the world. Do you have a theory, besides the obvious one (neighbor to the north seems a bit of a lunatic) as to why they hit it so hard there?</p>
      <p>Also: Do you have a sense yet of how the Korean Reds are different than the Japanese Reds? In St. Louis in 2014, I watched a South Korea-Algeria World Cup game with a group of avid Korea fans — most of them students, who’d come to the States for college. I think it was the politest, most orderly expression of sporting enthusiasm I’ve ever seen.</p>
      <p>Finally, where shall you be watching Crystal Palace? A whiskey bar in Seoul? A plane traversing the globe? Jet-lagged back on Merseyside?</p>
      <p>As ever,</p>

        <b>22 November 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hi Michael,</p>
      <p>I just love that story. I can imagine the transmission coming and going, the miles metaphorically walked in the car. The radio is something remarkable for live commentary, something we shouldn’t take for granted just because we have the ubiquitous images. And there will always be something about it cranking out across oceans which offers just that bit more magic. I used to love when on 5Live (or before it Radio 2) they would announce they were sharing commentary with the World Service. I’d imagine wirelesses across the globe crackling into life to the sound of Mike Ingham at Villa Park. Indeed, one of the most excited I’ve been for any broadcast I have ever done was with the World Service because of this back in early 2008 at the start of the heightened opposition to Hicks and Gillett.</p>
      <p>It’s here that I think we find what your friends and your fiance missed in that moment is the sheer romance of it all. Because that is what that story is. Romantic with a tragic twist at the end. What your friends may have perceived as a boorish obsessed man indulging himself was in fact someone who had a sudden, unlikely snatched call with a lover.</p>
      <p>They ought to have won for you, those bastards. They have possibly never let the side down more. In the timeline were they win you wander in and are the absolute life and soul. That they don’t win makes the telling all the sweeter now but that they didn’t in the moment broke the romance. These moments are now rarer because to be on the verge of being out of touch is so, so difficult. It’s easy to become nostalgic in a sense about that sort of thing but what constitutes romance changes, shifts. One state isn’t better than the others.</p>
      <p>And we can go further; one of the reasons there are fewer rom-coms these days, and fewer again good ones, is mobile phone technology. Essentially if everyone is broadly contactable in some way or another then it is harder to have the disconnections and perpetual misunderstandings that make up the romantic comedy. Imagine “I Know Where I Am Going” by Powell and Pressburger where Joan can just call Sir Robert. How does “When Harry Met Sally” work in a mobile age? Woody Allen never goes to Los Angeles in Annie Hall to see how Annie is doing in 2019. He checks out her Insta and she’s flying, having a great time and he goes back to bed, depressed, diminished.</p>
      <p>Younger people will solve this, indeed they have already started. The excellent “To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “The Big Sick” and “Sleeping With Other People” haven’t had the public praise they deserve, not least because there is a gendered bias about taking these sorts of films seriously which deepens as years go on and a multiplex full of Marvel films for them to have to break through. Regardless we move on; romance moves on, becomes different and no more or less complicated. Modernity is never anything to be scared of.</p>
      <p>•</p>
      <p>We do take the ubiquity for granted. There was a time when attendance was the only thing that ensured you could see every game. The last game that I think I wanted to see but couldn’t because it was just impossible was Oldham Athletic in the FA Cup in January 2014. We won 2-0. I have just had a scroll through LFChistory.net and whether through fair means or foul, if I have had the time free to watch the game then since then, I think I have managed it.</p>
      <p>What I think you shouldn’t become is tyrannized by the absolute need to watch it or the need to be there at the match. Liverpool - and football in general - is something worth making time for. Something worth impressing upon your loved ones that you will always try and accommodate but not something you can expect the whole world to click around. And in some seasons as we get closer and closer to glory, there is a need to be ever-increasing in flexibility. It is one thing to miss an early season clash against a bottom six side, another to miss Manchester United at home in March when three points clear at the top. So this season when I couldn’t do Norwich at home on the Friday night, well it was my friend’s wedding. That I wanted to go to. The decision was made and when the fixtures came in the joke wasn’t whether I would go but the joke was the gods conspiring against me because the decision had already been made. It would be the wedding.</p>
      <p>The next part of this is that if you aren’t attending or able to watch properly you should throw yourself into whatever the impediment is in good spirits. Switch the phone off - let it go. Don’t be that guy, that man who acts as though he is under duress. In general, in life, doing the thing in front of you with as much gusto and commitment as possible is as good a philosophy as any.</p>
      <p>I’m not sanguine as such. The game against City had to be watched and indeed, any game in those circumstances had to be watched. I love watching Liverpool overseas, love seeing the bars and the people. It makes me think of all the hearts and minds focussed on The Reds when I am next in Anfield. I met Yumiko Tamaru of the Tokyo Supporters Club when in Japan and she gave me one of their scarves and I shall wear it for Napoli at home, both memento and representation. Romance changes, shifts.</p>
      <p>Next Saturday is a really good example of one where I am very much not sanguine because I will be in the air as the game kicks off and I have to be honest with you - I have not taken that well. Quietly. In that way I refuse to process inconvenient facts at times, I repeatedly stated we were landing around 10am on Saturday despite the fact it is 10pm and I have been told that again and again. Now though the reality opens up. I may see if there is that new wi-fi they have on planes and see if I can conjure a stream somehow. I would pay hard cash now equivalent to my match ticket for a guarantee of 90 minutes of live commentary from Conor McNamara and Pat Nevin through my headphones. In fact nothing could make me happier.</p>
      <p>There is nothing to throw yourself into with gusto on a plane. The whole process is at best mildly entertained waiting. Waiting to be away, on tour; waiting to be on business, working; waiting to be home, finally. There is nothing to get your teeth into. Knowing I am disconnected, knowing there is a game happening is going to kill me in these circumstances. I will squirm and twitch.</p>
      <p>And it is a game I am worried about. They are both due a result in general and due a result in their gaff against us. The Hodgson algorithm for this season states he wins one of the next three and they have no wins in four. He currently, wonderfully, sits on having managed 300 Premier League games and picked up 104 wins in that period. Presuming he manages Crystal Palace’s next 21 league games I would love him to only pick up 3 wins. Really nail that ratio.</p>
      <p>For all the talk of Palace’s status as a tough team for Liverpool they haven’t beaten us at their place since Klopp arrived. They have the two landmark wins at Anfield since Jurgen arrived. The first prompting Klopp to wonder about being all alone and the second being the last time anyone has beaten us at Anfield. I think there is something that flatters to deceive about Selhurst Park - they perhaps suffer from the idea that the bigger sides take it very seriously indeed and so are very determined not to be stung.</p>
      <p>Still, being stung is possible and being stung still includes a draw despite Chelsea and Manchester City facing one another. This really isn’t the time to lose momentum - indeed the run between now and the Club World Cup is crucial. We will miss a game then but we can make that work for us and it is worth bearing in mind that weekend Manchester City and Leicester City face each other. I’m still not sure how seriously we need to take Leicester; there is surely a ceiling on their likely points haul this season - we just don’t yet have a sense on exactly where it is.</p>
      <p>I agree with you about not really getting a sense of how punished we have been until February, but oddly feel we know more about that now than we have before, that Qatar could well not be a bad thing because I doubt either game Liverpool play will be as intense as Premier League football and the temperatures are kind and that we have the focus in terms of what is at stake. Being 8 clear of Chelsea and Leicester and 9 clear of City makes this the best chance this side may well ever have of claiming this elusive Premier League title with 26 games to go. It will still need to be relentless but right now - as opposed to this time last season - it is crystal clear what the goal is and what we are capable of achieving. It was this time last season when we were still worried about keeping pace with City, feeling as though it may well just be too much before we kicked on.</p>
      <p>But we paid for the kicking on second half of January and start of February and so I take the general point. Ironically, I think the odd short-term injury given chance to be shaken off is no bad thing. This group of players will want to play through the pain barrier and want to play every minute to make sure. There being small knocks here and there to extend rest periods with enforced absences may well mean legs and brains are in better shape for longer. These are the “iffyest” of ifs though and will be little comfort if Liverpool are blunted in the absence of Mo Salah and defeated by the Hodgson Algorithm on Saturday.</p>
      <p>•</p>
      <p>Seoul and Tokyo are markedly different as places. Seoul is a really rather quartered city. In Tokyo everything was on top of everything else; every little bit was its own odd, strange fevered metropolis. Seoul though appears to have been quite consciously divided up. I have seen very few suits on my travails and that is a shame - I think thrown together cities are the best ones and cities where the planners have held just too much sway lose that sense of cross pollination which makes the public square so special. I think quarters stunt rather than breed creativity. I especially hate talk of the creative quarter, the idea that we need those people over there and that businesses have to show no creativity whatsoever or even engage with it.</p>
      <p>So I haven’t met with any Seoul Reds - there has been no game unfortunately - the flight comes both too late and too early! I am though in the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Seoul as I type this. Which has an excellent exhibition on public spaces.</p>
      <p>The drinking is fascinating to be honest. I think a massive part of it is because of the type of drinks. Seoul has quite the array of drinks that appear to be rather unique to Korea along with everything we have. And I reckon here lies the answer about why they put the most alcohol away per capita. Soju is just the tip of the iceburg and is drank with and in beer. And runs at 19 - 25%. Then there is Bokbunja which is like wine but made from blackberries. This runs at 15-19%. Maeshilju is made from apples. Like cider. But has the taste of dessert wine. 14% that. Dongdongju finds itself being sipping gear. A session offering. 6% to 8%. Call me Sherlock Holmes but I think we could have our answer.</p>
      <p>It is perhaps for the best I haven’t met the Seoul Reds. It could all prove too much, especially of Saturday gets emotional.</p>
      <p>Instead it will be the plane and it will be fraught. But anyway, we should always in some way shape or form be in the Fiat. Because if we aren’t what’s the point of the whole enterprise?</p>
