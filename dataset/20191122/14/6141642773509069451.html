      <p>People without a home are being offered help in registering to vote by staff at a city centre cafe in Bristol.</p>
      <p>Workers at the Arnolfini Cafe Bar are offering help printing out, filling in and sending off the necessary form to rough sleepers or anyone else without a permanent address – as well as a free hot drink while they do it.</p>
      <p>Domhnaill Barnes, head of operations at the cafe’s owners the Bristol Beer Factory, told PA: “This is a completely apolitical process, we’re not advising people how to vote, we’re just trying to assist people into voting.”</p>

      <p>According to the Electoral Commission, those without a fixed address can register using an address “where you spend a lot of your time or have some connection”.</p>
      <p>Bristol City Council said the move was perfectly legal, and that it supported the cafe’s initiative, while Bristol East MP Kerry McCarthy tweeted: “Great initiative from Arnolfini – no-one should lose their right to vote because they don’t have a place to live.”</p>

      <p>As of Friday morning, Mr Barnes said “about half a dozen” people had taken the cafe up on their offer, and he was expecting more as word of the initiative continues to spread.</p>
      <p>“It’s a tragedy that their voices wouldn’t be heard,” he said. “Often these are people on the margins of society and so I think just allowing us to do one small thing to bring them back into the social discourse, the political discussion is a valuable thing for us to be doing.”</p>
      <p>Mr Barnes said other organisations around the country had been in touch expressing an interest in setting up similar schemes.</p>

      <p>Crisis, the national charity for homeless people, said many homeless people believe they are ineligible to vote.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Jon Sparkes said: “We can all agree no-one should be excluded from voting simply because they don’t have a permanent address. But for many people across the country, this remains a huge barrier.</p>
      <p>“Without a safe and secure home of their own, many people experiencing homelessness think they are not eligible to vote but this is simply not the case.</p>
      <p>“Registering under a past address, where you are staying temporarily or an address nearest to where you are rough sleeping are all available options.”</p>
