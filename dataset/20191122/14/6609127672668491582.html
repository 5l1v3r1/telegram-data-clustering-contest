        <b>CELTIC have learned their disciplinary fate from Uefa after being charged for offences during the home 2-1 win over Lazio last month.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> have been fined £13K by European football's governing body.</p>

      <p>The charges were for 'illicit banners' and 'illicit chants' from their supporters as Neil Lennon's men recorded a famous win over the Italian giants.</p>
      <p>The section of Parkhead which hosts the Green Brigade <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10210270/celtic-lazio-uefa-banners/">displayed a series of controversial banners throughout the match</a>.</p>
      <p>They displayed a "Brigate Verde" tifo which bore a striking resemblance to Italian left-wing organisation Brigate Rosse.</p>
      <p>A flag depicting former dictator Mussolini's hanging was also unveiled with the words "follow your leader" <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10223473/celtic-slam-mussolini-granddaughter-f-off/">which led to the former Italian prime minister's granddaughter hitting out at Celts supporters.</a></p>

      <p>There were also messages which translated to "f*** Lazio" and <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4876017/celtic-lazio-europa-league-green-brigade/">"Laziale Parto Anale" which roughly translates to "Lazio fans are birthed anally"</a>.</p>
      <p>The Serie A club were also found guilty by Uefa of 'illicit chants' during the match in October.</p>
      <p>They were fined £8.5K.</p>
      <p>The hearing was held yesterday by the Disciplinary Panel at Uefa headquarters.</p>

      <p>It's the third time that the Celts have been charged after Europa League this season.</p>
      <p>The Parkhead club were fined £11,000 after fans set off flares and threw objects during their 4-1 win over AIK in Stockholm.</p>
      <p>They were then fined £10,400 for setting off more pyrotechnics during their pre-match display on the night they beat Cluj 2-0.</p>
      <p>Celtic won the Group E clash 2-1 despite Lazio taking a first-half lead.</p>
      <p>Ryan Christie and Christopher Jullien netted late on to put the Glasgow giants top of the standings after three games.</p>
