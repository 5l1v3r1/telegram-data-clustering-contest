      <p>The new store, which is part of Aldi's investment in local communities across the UK, has created a raft of new job opportunities. The retailer aims to have 1,200 stores by 2025.</p>
      <p>The new Aldi store is also calling on local charities and food banks in West Bromwich, to register with Neighbourly, a community engagement platform that links businesses to charitable organisations in their community to receive regular donations of surplus food from the supermarket.</p>
      <p>Any charities in the area that would like to partner up with the West Bromwich store, can email aldi@neighbourly.com.</p>
