      <p>These lovely pieces of concept art for The Last of Us: Part 2 would look perfect hanging in your nerd room, or anywhere else in your humble abode.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cookandbecker.com/en/artgallery/2794/the-last-of-us-part-ii-fine-art-print-collection.html">Art dealership Cook &amp; Becker</a> is offering the collection of artwork in cooperation with Naughty Dog for <b>The Last of Us: Part 2</b>.</p>
