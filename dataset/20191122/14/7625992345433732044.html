      <p>"I received an email saying flight was changed to call 801-401-9005, I can't through just busy signal," one traveler wrote on Twitter. "When I look in the frontier app flight has not changed? Can someone help me."</p>
      <p>Frontier on Friday advised passengers tp check their trips by entering their confirmation numbers on its website.</p>
      <p>Thanksgiving is among the busiest travel periods of the year. Next week, about 4.5 million Americans will fly to visit family and friends, up almost 5% from a year ago, <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/tag/thanksgiving-travel-forecast/">according</a> to AAA. </p>

      <p>Consumers weren't impressed with Frontier's handling of the glitch. Others noted that it took hours for Frontier to respond to questions about the wayward email.</p>
