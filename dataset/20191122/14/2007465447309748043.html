      <h1>2020 Mitsubishi Mirage is coming to PH, but when?</h1>
      <h2>Excited for the 2020 Mitsubishi Mirage? You'll have to wait a little longer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:49:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/anton-andres.html" target="_blank">Anton Andres</a></address>
      <p>Last week, the 2020 Mitsubishi Mirage made its debut in Thailand. Judging from the comments, feedback has been (mostly) positive regarding the changes made to the subcompact car. Of course, we also wondered when it will sold in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Turns out, it won't be right after its debut in Thailand. A source close to the matter told us that it may actually take a while. One thing is for certain though: it will be sold here. Now you're probably wondering now why we won't get it right away. Well,it has something to do with the fact that the Mirage hatch and Mirage G4 sedan are assembled here in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Why is this a factor, you ask? At the moment, the production hub in Santa Rosa, Laguna has the stampings and moldings needed for the current body. As there is a fair amount of panels changed to the both body styles of the car, the plant will have to re-tool and that takes time. On top of that, it costs a lot to re-tool a plant for it to be able to produce the new parts. It may be a facelift for the Mirage and Mirage G4 (albeit a major one), but getting these cars rolling off production line isn't as simple as merely changing some tools; it's a major investment.</p>

      <p>Is there an estimated time of launch, then? Sadly, there isn't one. Again, these production factors are what dictates the car's debut in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>What about the next-gen Mirage then? Well, as it turns out, this model is the transition before we get the fully redesigned one. But don't expect it to come out in a few years. Given that facelifts would typically (but not always) run for about three years, the all-new Mirage could come out in the mid-2020s.</p>
      <p>Mitsubishi's former chief operating officer Trevor Mann has confirmed that it will be based on the Renault-Nissan (and now, Mitsubishi) Common Module Family platform. In the case of the future Mirage, it will be the CMF-B with the 'B' standing for B-segment or subcompact class. It's also the same one used on the 2020 Nissan Almera and Renault Clio so expect the Mitsubishi grow in size by the time the all-new Mirage and Mirage G4 come out.</p>
