      <p>There are some tragedies that leave families torn apart for life, especially, when such events have to do with the lives of their children.</p>
      <p>Some of these events are forgivable, however, when it is in close relationship with carelessness, it breaks the whole being of the parents involved.</p>
      <p>In two unrelated events, two young boys have lost their lives due to burns from falling in cooking pot.</p>
      <p>In a report from CNN, a three-year-old boy was playing when he fell into a pot of sambhar at a party thrown by his family to celebrate the opening of a shop on November 18 in Shabad, Telangana state, said G. Narsaiah, an inspector with Shabad police.</p>
      <p>Sambhar is a spicy lentil-based vegetable stew that is popular in southern India.</p>
      <p>The boy accidentally moved the lid covering the pot and fell in, he was rushed to the hospital but died of burn injuries.</p>
      <p>In the same vein, two people, including a school principal, are being investigated by police for negligence resulting in death over a similar, but unconnected, incident on November 13 where a six-year-old kindergarten student named Behlapuram Reddy died after falling into a pot of sambhar at a school in Panyam village, in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh state.</p>
      <p>Reddy rushed with his classmates into the dining hall at the start of the school’s lunch hour. In a statement by R.M. Basha, assistant sub-inspector of Panyam police:</p>
      <p>“When the boy ran in, he fell into the sambhar bowl. No school authorities were available. Some local workers pulled him out and took him to the hospital.”</p>
      <p>In India, school lunches are cooked in large pots that can be up to four feet (1.2 meters) in diameter.</p>
      <p>The child was treated for burns at the local hospital but died because of the burns.</p>
      <p>Reddy’s father registered a case at the Panyam police station later that evening and police are now investigating. The two people under investigation were being held on judicial remand.</p>
      <p>Also, the father of the six-year-old kindergarten kid has filed a complaint with police but no arrests have been made.</p>
