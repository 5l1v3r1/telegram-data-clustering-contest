      <p>It’s been announced that <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/50-years-of-floyd-david-gilmour-exclusive-interview">David Gilmour</a> will give his only interview about the upcoming <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/pink-floyd-their-best-albums">Pink Floyd</a> box set <i>The Later Years</i> on a new podcast.</p>
      <p>It’s titled <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1KjzZRNw6MPlg4cViSMZVb?si=HqWxH9BQSS2PEsAXM0Ax8A"><i>The Lost Art Of Conversation</i>, with the weekly four-part series getting underway on November 25</a>.</p>
      <p>The guitarist has given exclusive access to BBC Radio’s Matt Everett to chat about the 16-disc collection, which brings together Floyd’s albums from 1987 onwards, along with live cuts and previously unreleased tracks. It’ll be released on December 13.</p>
      <p>Gilmour will talk about the tracks that would go on to appear on <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/pink-floyd-the-endless-river"><i>The Endless River</i></a>, look back at Pink Floyd in the late 80s, delve into the band’s creative output, discuss the ideas behind their striking artwork and reflect on their live performances.</p>
      <p>Speaking about Floyd’s 1987 return for <i>A Momentary Lapse Of Reason</i>, Gilmour says: “It’s quite a big thing to carry on Pink Floyd with <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/top-10-best-pink-floyd-roger-waters-songs">Roger Waters</a> having gone. He is a big, big part of it obviously, a major talent and our primary lyricist, so it was difficult.”</p>
      <p>He adds: “I was so glad to have Rick Wright there with his ideas and playing the way he did. And Nick Mason is the perfect drummer for Pink Floyd. It all felt so right on those sessions.”</p>
      <p>Along with the albums, <i>The Later Years</i> will also include two 7-inch vinyl singles in new picture sleeves, featuring <i>Arnold Layne</i> performed live by Pink Floyd at the Syd Barrett Tribute concert in 2007, and <i>Lost For Words</i> from the <i>Pulse</i> tour rehearsals at Earl’s Court.</p>
      <p>A 60-page hardback book of photos designed by Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis and Peter Curzon of StormStudios will also feature, including many previously unseen images.</p>
      <p>There will also be a set of newly-created set of reproduction tour programmes from Pink Floyd World Tour 1987/1988, Pink Floyd Live 1989, Pink Floyd European Tour 1994 – plus a new lyric book.</p>
      <p>A collection of memorabilia including tour passes, stickers and posters, all printed to replicate the originals, and contained in a prestige card envelope, will also be in the collection.</p>
