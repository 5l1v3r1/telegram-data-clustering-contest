      <p><b>Amaravati</b>: Taking one more significant step towards enforcing total prohibition in the next four years, the YS Jaganmohan Reddy government on Friday withdrew the licences of all 830 bars in Andhra Pradesh. <br/><br/>A new policy on bars with stringent conditions will come into effect from January 1. The new policy will reduce the number of bars by 40 per cent (to nearly 500 bars) besides jacking up the fee and reducing the service timings. <br/><br/>The government announced that it would refund the licence fee and non-refundable registration charge amounts for the remaining period, calculating it on a monthly proportionate basis. The government also claimed that it is implementing Article 47 of the Constitution of India that stipulates that state should endeavor to bring about prohibition of the consumption of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to health, except for medicinal purposes. <br/><br/>"In compliance with the Constitutional obligations, the government has taken a policy decision to implement prohibition in a phased manner," said special chief secretary to government, D Sambasiva Rao while issuing the orders canceling licences. <br/><br/>It may be mentioned that the retail liquor shops had already been brought under government control and the number of shops were drastically reduced. This resulted in the fall in the revenue to Rs 3,683.25 crore till October this financial year from the Rs 4043.72 crore last year. <br/><br/><b>Bar owners threaten to challenge premature closure order<br/></b><br/>However, the governmentâ€™s move may hit a legal block as the bar owners are gearing up to challenge the decision in court. They contend that they had paid licence fees till June 30, 2020. <br/><br/>"We have paid the renewal fee for the period of July 2019 to June 2020 last week, after the new government took over. Mid-term decision will push us into crisis," said a representative of the bar owners. <br/><br/><br/>"We were given licences till June 2022 only after we had furnished the lease agreements for the premises. The owners collected huge amounts from us. Will the government arrange for return of those deposit amounts too? We pay advances to the cooks and other staff. We cannot recover the amounts from them unless we continue their services for a few months," he said. "After throwing us out of the business, the government will issue fresh licenses for 500 bars. This is unfair," he contended.</p>
