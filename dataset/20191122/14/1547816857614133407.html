        <b>Bigg Boss 13 Weekend Ka Vaar episode is currently being shot with Salman Khan and looks like we can expect a lot of fireworks this weekend. The inside Khabri just said that Salman has lost his cool over Sidharth Shukla's violent actions.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Every weekend Salman Khan takes the stage for the special episode of Bigg Boss. <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/tags/bigg-boss-13">Bigg Boss 13</a> Weekend Ka Vaar is being shot as we speak with Salman in Filmcity, Mumbai and twitter account The Khabri has some inside dope regarding what's happening between Salman and the housemates. If you are the one who follows Bigg Boss religiously would be aware of a massive showdown between Sidharth Shukla and Asim Riaz. Both who were buddies first suddenly have turned into worst enemies compelling their fans to show their support and love in the form of trending hashtags. Every day for one week we are witnessing hashtags like #StayStrongSidharthShukla and #NationWithAsimRiaz.<br/><br/>Now that Bhai has taken the stage and it is his turn to give his two bits we have it from The Khabri's twitter account that Salman is not mincing words when it comes to bashing Sidharth Shukla and his violent behaviour. So much so that Khan also told him 'Tujhe industry main kaam karna hai ya nahi?'. The tweet reads, "#EXCLUSIVE #WeekendKaVaar. Salman Khan bashed #SidharthShukla like never before, Even warned him, Tune industry me kaam karna ha ya nahi. Still Bashing #NationWithAsim" Also Read: <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-weekend-ka-vaar-salman-khan-unleashes-his-ugly-side-asim-riaz-and-sidharth-shukla-on-his-target/5dd7e9e50cada251e9c31160">Bigg Boss 13 Weekend Ka Vaar: Salman Khan Unleashes His Ugly Side; Asim Riaz And Sidharth Shukla On His Target</a></p>

      <p>This is definitely going to make all Asim Riaz fans happy as Sidharth Shukla playing the religion card is a big NO on national TV. Sometimes back we also told you that<a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-weekend-ka-vaar-salman-khan-unleashes-his-ugly-side-asim-riaz-and-sidharth-shukla-on-his-target/5dd7e9e50cada251e9c31160"> #NationWithAsim is trending on the number 1 position which means it will help Asim win that many votes, putting him in the safe spot. </a></p>

      <p>There are many Sidharth Shukla fans too who tried to trend #ThrowOutAsimRiaz but looks like Asim is definitely winning the trending game on the social media. </p>
