      <h2>State-owned Russian bank sends promotional code using phrase 'kill Jews', client says.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:59:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:59</time> by <a rel="author">Cnaan Liphshiz, JTA</a></address>
      <p>A Russian state-owned bank sent to one of its clients a promotional code that contained the phrase “Kill Jews.”</p>
      <p>Artem Chapaev, a former creative consultant at Amnesty International from Moscow, on Wednesday posted on Twitter a screen shot of the password, which he received as a text to his smartphone from Sberbank.</p>
      <p>The code was in Russian but the Latin alphabet letters that comprised the code were: “CRYVKILLJEWS.”</p>
      <p>As his tweet began being shared, Sberbank, which is 51 percent owned by the Central Bank of Russia, claimed the image was doctored and not authentic.</p>
      <p>“The screenshot clearly shows that the password has been edited. So someone obviously wants to set us up,” the person handling the bank’s Twitter feed wrote.</p>
      <p>But after a short while, Sberbank recognized the image’s authenticity and said it was the result of random code generation, <i>Jewish.ru</i> reported. The report did not say whether Chapaev was Jewish.</p>
      <p>“This is really no Photoshop. We are surprised ourselves, but this situation is pure coincidence. Our code generator didn’t mean to offend anyone,” the bank wrote.</p>
      <p>The incident coincided with the publication of an Anti-Defamation League survey of 9,000 people in Europe and beyond that suggested that the prevalence of anti-Semitic sentiment in Eastern Europe, including Russia, has risen significantly since 2015.</p>
      <p>Whereas that year only 23 percent of respondents in Russia agreed with anti-Semitic statements presented to them in the poll, this year the figure was 31 percent.</p>
