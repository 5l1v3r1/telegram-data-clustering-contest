      <p>A bank robber dressed in a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> T-Shirt hit out at a teller he targeted for giving him too much cash, police say.</p>
      <p>Sandy Hawkins, 73, reportedly held-up the Wells Fargo bank in Boca Raton, Florida, on Tuesday after passing a note saying ‘Give me $1,100 now.’</p>
      <p>The worried teller passed him $2,000, only for Hawkins – who was also wearing a ‘Make America Great Again Hat,’ to again demand he be given $1,100.</p>
      <p>Bizarrely, retired air conditioning worker Hawkins’ note is said to have added: ‘No alarms. Hope to get caught.’</p>
      <p>And his wish came true shortly after, when deputies from Boca Raton County Sheriff’s Office arrested him and charged him with robbery.</p>
      <p>He visited a branch where staff recognized him as a regular customer, making it much easier for police to arrest him.</p>
      <p>Staff initially believed he was asking for a regular withdrawal, and requested Hawkins debit card, it is alleged.</p>

      <p>But he told them ‘This is a robbery. I have a weapon.’ and reached into the waistband of his pants.</p>
      <p>Sheriff’s have since said that Hawkins was unarmed.</p>
      <p>Hawkins’ ex-landlord Scott Vail painted a sympathetic picture of the alleged robber, saying he’d been left devastated by the death of his wife from cancer in 2013.</p>
      <p>He told the <a href="https://www.newsherald.com/news/20191122/florida-robber-told-bank-teller-you-gave-me-too-much">Panama City News-Herald</a>: ‘I knew it was pretty devastating.</p>
      <p>‘He was just an affable kind of person. He probably reached some kind of breaking point.’</p>
      <p>Hawkins confirmed he was the man who had robbed the bank when he was arrested at his home shortly afterwards, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>No motive for the bizarre crime has been given.</p>
      <p>Hawkins has been charged with robbery without a weapon, and is being held in Palm Beach County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bond.</p>
