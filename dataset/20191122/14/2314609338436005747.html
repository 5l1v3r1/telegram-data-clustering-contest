      <h1>At U2's Sydney concert, the highlights might not be what you expect</h1>

      <p>Australia, count your blessings. Not just because the world’s biggest rock band are touring but because U2 are here with their <i>Joshua Tree</i> show.</p>
      <p>That album’s actual 30th-anniversary year was 2017 but after the original celebration tour then, the Irish four-piece hit the road anew last year in support of their twin longplayers <i>Songs of Innocence</i> (notoriously yours on iTunes in 2014, whether you wanted it or not) and <i>Songs of Experience</i> (for which you had to pay to own but wisely probably didn’t).</p>

      <p>Mercifully, then, we didn’t get the <i>Innocence + Experience</i> tour and its surplus of inferior newer material. Rather, we got U2 revisiting a truly classic album between two mini-sets of revitalised greatest hits.</p>
      <p>(As it happens, we also got something similar from Noel Gallagher earlier – he started his support slot with his more challenging but sometimes wonderful High Flying Birds material, before knocking us out with a handful of mighty Oasis tunes. But back to the main event.)</p>
      <p>U2’s first smart move was to open the show with all four members performing on a runway deep into the crowd, without using the enormous screen behind them – so we were at first made to watch the band rather than the spectacle.</p>

      <p>Here’s Larry Mullen jnr, pounding out the righteous march of <i>Sunday Bloody Sunday</i>. There’s Adam Clayton with the first of many simple but iconic bass lines (<i>New Year’s Day</i>). And then <i>Bad</i>, with its aching heart given added poignancy as singer Bono points out this day was the anniversary of his friend Michael Hutchence’s death, and so tries to fit INXS’s <i>Never Tear Us Apart</i> to its melody.</p>
      <p>The spectacle soon followed, inevitably, with <i>The Joshua Tree</i> beautifully mounted with Anton Corbijn’s evocative visuals providing the backdrop as the band played it in order in its entirety.</p>
      <p>The highlights might not be what you expected. While The Edge showed he can still be a thrillingly creative guitarist on the likes of <i>Bullet the Blue Sky</i> and <i>In God’s Country</i>, Bono refused to sing <i>With or Without You</i> properly, despite the fact he proved throughout the night he could still hit the high notes.</p>

      <p>At least he pleasantly surprised us with a blast of his harmonica on <i>Running to Standstill</i>, which most of us didn’t expect to hear until (a sublime) <i>Trip Through Your Wires</i>.</p>

      <p>The shadow of Hutchence reappeared when we got to the last rush of career highlights via a chorus from INXS’s <i>Devil Inside</i> during <i>Vertigo</i>, and U2’s own affecting tribute <i>Stuck in a Moment You Can’t Get Out Of</i>.</p>
      <p>But it was three songs from 1991’s <i>Achtung Baby</i> album that ultimately confirmed this show’s main point. <i>Even Better Than the Real Thing</i> set to a disco beat with yet more Edge heroics, <i>Ultraviolet</i>’s celebration of womanhood and an inevitably powerful and emotional <i>One</i> all showed that despite the occasional earlier flaw, U2 remain the world’s reigning kings of stadium rock.</p>
