      <p>A 66-year-old Sakubva granny was dragged to court after being found with 228kgs of mbanje</p>
      <p>Anna Mudauriwo <a href="https://www.manicapost.co.zw/granny-in-court-over-228kg-of-dagga/">was charged with unlawfully possessing dag_ga as defined in Section 157(1) (A) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act Chapter 9:23.</a></p>
      <p>Mudauriwo denied the charges and was remanded out of custody to November 28 after paying $150 bail.</p>
      <p>Prosecuting, Mr Nyasha Mukonyora said:</p>
      <aside>“On November 11 at around midnight police received information concerning the accused person. Acting on that tip-off, a team of detectives was formed and it reacted to the supplied information. They proceeded to the suspect’s homestead and conducted a search,” said Mr Mukonyora.<br/>During the search, the cops observed that one room was locked. The detectives requested for the room to be opened but Mudauriwo did not comply. She said the room was occupied by her tenant who had gone out. That is when the detectives force-opened the door and gained entry into the room. In that room, they found 10 bags of dagga wrapped with black plastics.</aside>
      <p>The recovered mbanje was taken to Zimpost Mutare where it was weighed and it produced a weight of 228kg</p>
