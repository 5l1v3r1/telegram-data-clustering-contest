      <h1>Kalidasa Kannada Meshtru movie review: This Kannada film is at the higher end of entertainment and lower end of a serious debate</h1>

      <p>The Supreme Court judgement on the medium of education must have settled the dispute between mother tongues and English. The developments in the last few years have just proved otherwise even as mother tongues fight an existential battle. Kaviraj picks this debate that rages on and off in the media, elevates the problem to the education system based on rote learning, adds Jaggesh to the mix and whips up a sentimental appeal to stem the rot. <br/><br/>Nothing wrong if Kaviraj wants to put across his vision in a movie but is this not something that would be better off in something alike of a Michael Moore documentary? That would be another debate. Here in the film, there is ample Jaggesh-isms to provide entertainment. <br/><br/>At one level the film is a domestic drama about a nouveau girl who has ended up marrying a Kannada 'meshtru' who cannot save his life reciting Twinkle twinkle little star. It is also the story of the Kannada teacher who is fighting a losing battle against the private English-medium schools. And finally the film is about all the kids who find themselves imprisoned in schools every day. There are also other narratives to choose your pick. That is also one of the drawbacks of the film; there is excessive digression of the point-of-view. <br/><br/>There is no dearth of entertainment if that is the sole criteria. The discussion on the 'education system' however is convoluted. The meshtru's demands could have been simple. The limitation of also making the film entertaining and appeal to Jaggesh's fans prevents a nuanced exploration of the issues involved. The appeal from the kids' point of view is more straightforward and appealing. Two brilliant songs convey the children's position and have excellent music by Gurukiran. <br/><br/>Kalidasa Kannada Meshtru is at the higher end of entertainment and lower end of a serious debate. This is what perhaps the markets demand. Not a bad proposition at all as this is one of the few films with an 'U' appeal (certificate from the Censor).</p>
