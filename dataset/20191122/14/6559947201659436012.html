      <p> <b>$20.00</b></p>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <p>Inexpensive; free version available. Supports 4K editing and output. Decent PiP, chroma-key, and transparency tools. Lots of file format support. Small install size.</p>
      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <p>Awkward interface. Can't play preview in the timeline editor. No multi-cam, motion tracking, or 3D support. No Help feature. Occasionally unstable in testing.</p>
      <h4>Bottom Line</h4>
      <p>If you really don't want to pay much for video editing software, VSDC Video Editor can do a decent amount with your clips, but top products are far easier to use, more stable, and more powerful.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>You may have video-editing needs that don't warrant spending close to $100 for an enthusiast-level application like CyberLink's PowerDirector. VSDC Video Editor Pro costs just $19.99 and includes some fairly advanced <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/video-editing/16182/the-best-video-editing-software">video editing</a> tools. Though VSDC has improved significantly since our last review, it's still hard to recommend over the admittedly pricier competition like PowerDirector, which is both more powerful and easier to use.</p>
      <h3>Pricing and Starting Up</h3>
      <p>VSDC is available at two levels: Free and the $19.99 Pro edition—still far cheaper than most capable video editing software, and the version I review here. The paid version adds support for more media types, advanced settings, hardware acceleration, sub-pixel resolution, and audio waveform editing. It also adds premium support and extra masking and chroma-keying capabilities. You can upgrade at any time, entering a license key into the program; after a restart, you'll be in Pro.</p>
      <p>The program runs on Windows XP SP3 through Windows 10 (though no one should be running old, unsupported operating systems!). The installer weighs in at 70 MB—svelte, compared with most video editors, which often top the scales at over a gigabyte. After installation, the program takes up 284MB on the hard drive. When you first run the program, a dialog box offers help with getting started. The choices include Open a New Project, Start Editing, and Export a Project. These are actually links to web help pages.</p>

      <h3>Interface</h3>
      <p>As you might expect from such an inexpensive program, VSDC's interface lacks some of the polish of, say, <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/video-editing/8460/cyberlink-powerdirector">CyberLink PowerDirector</a>. You often find yourself searching for a feature that's buried behind a Properties panel accessed by a right-click. The center of the program's startup interface shows five square buttons under the Start Project Now group and eight round ones under Get to Know Top Features.</p>
      <p>The interface is now pleasingly dark, and the top menu switches the toolbar ribbon among Projects, Scenes, Edit, View, Editor, Export, Tools, and Activation modes. You can minimize the ribbon to show just the smaller editing toolbars. As in Office apps, you can customize the small Quick Access toolbar at the very top, with the standard New, Open, and Save options, but also a Preview button.</p>
      <p>Startup choices include Blank Project, Slideshow, Import Content, Video Capture, and Screen Capture. Features include effects such as color correction and filters, 4K editing, blending, masking, chroma-keying, waveforms, 3D charts, and combining multimedia.</p>
      <p>One thing I could not find in any of these many toolbars was a Help button. That would have come in useful. One case of that is when choosing to start with a blank project, since there's no Import media button. I finally figured out that the little green play button icon opens an import File Explorer window for video clips. Another issue is the aforementioned fact that many capabilities live within the arcana of Properties menus.</p>
      <p>The interface is very customizable, with a big preview panel at top center, Resources and Effects on the right, and Objects Explorer on the left. You can move the panels around, undock them, and select which buttons you want to appear in the various toolbars.</p>
      <p>A big improvement since the last time I reviewed VSDC is that you can now actually preview your project without having to open Windows Media Player. You can even start playback with the spacebar. As you preview, the insertion point on the timeline now keeps sync with what you're watching. But playback isn't as smooth as in competing programs, because it doesn't use proxy files. Most apps use those in editing rather that the full-size video, to speed up working in the timeline.</p>
      <p>The separate Cutting and Splitting window also lets you preview a clip while cutting regions. But that is awkward to use, making even basic trimming a challenge.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>The timeline track heads are still problematic, since, spreadsheet-style, some information cells are hidden. I was unable to enlarge some of the cells to see what they contained. Luckily, hover-over tooltips indicate their function, but it's still not great interface design.</p>
      <p>Making the interface even more cluttered, along the immediate left side and top of the preview window are Photoshop-like toolbars for things like adding and aligning shapes and text.</p>
      <h3>Basic Video Editing</h3>
      <p>If you choose Import Content from the starting screen, you can only add one file at a time, but once you're in a project, you can add multiple files at once. You can't add multiple video clips directly to the timeline, but only through the File sequence wizard, which inserts transitions. These are added to the timeline as a single Sprite, which initially shows up as one track on the timeline, but double-clicking this expands to the full number of component tracks.</p>
      <p>Drag-and-drop now works within the timeline; you can drag clips onto the video preview window and move them from track to track. You can also slide clips back and forth within their tracks.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/670699-vsdc-video-editor.png?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>When you create a new project, you can specify the author, resolution, frame rate, and audio format. Next, you see the File's sequence wizard window, which lists transitions for your movie's clips. It also helpfully lets you rotate clips—I still see upside-down iPhone clips in some software, including VSDC. In the same window, you can add multiple clips. But when I did this, the transitions weren't applied in the main timeline.</p>
      <p>Adding a video clip prompts a confusing object position settings dialog and adds a layer to the timeline, rather than just a horizontal clip entry. If you drag a clip from the Resources window, you avoid these issues and can drag the clip to the position you want, just like in most video editing software.</p>
      <p>The auto-contrast and auto-levels options didn't greatly affect my video's image, but Auto-gamma is quite effective. There's no dehaze tool like that in <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/video-editing/8296/adobe-premiere-elements">Adobe Premiere Elements</a>. For manual adjustment, you tap the ellipsis […] next to a setting in a right-side panel. When you do this, a full-screen-width adjustment line appears, which you can add keyframes to gradually increase or decrease the level. Yes, it works, but it takes some sleuthing to figure out. Worse, it reliably prompted a program crash in my testing.</p>
      <h3>Fancy Video Effects</h3>
      <p>Cropping, rotating, transparency, and creating picture-in-picture video effects are quite easy in VSDC. You simply drag the borders where you want for cropping and PiP, and a rotate button makes quick work of turning your video over.</p>
      <p>VSDC's Instagram style filters and old-film styles are also welcome effects, as is the workable chroma-keying. The latter did let me remove a green background, but the results weren't as impressive as with other software like <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/video-editing/2457/corel-videostudio-ultimate">Corel VideoStudio</a> or CyberLink PowerDirector.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>New for the 2019 version is support for VirtualDub plugins; there are a multitude of these open source effects available for download. You can find a good selection at <a href="http://www.infognition.com/VirtualDubFilters/">Infognition</a>. You'll find basic adjustments and effects such as cartoon, vintage, and grain among these plug-ins. A halftone VirtualDub filter I tried completely covered my clip, but the LuminanceBand one worked like a charm.</p>
      <p>A few advanced video techniques that you won't find support for in VSDC include multi-cam and motion tracking. In its favor, VSDC now lets you edit 360 VR content, 4K, and HEVC video content without any complaints. It also lets you create shape masks, which you can even use to pixelate areas in the video and follow motion paths, but the program doesn't automate it or even make it easy.</p>
      <p>The text tool is actually WYSIWYG, letting you type over the screen image. A good selection of fonts and colors are at your disposal, but you don't get the more advanced text options found in other software, such as 3D, rotation, and transparent cutout text.</p>
      <p>You can do a freeze-frame effect simply by inserting a still snapshot into the timeline. Speed slowdown and speedup are also possible from a clip's Properties menu. Backwards playback is yet another option.</p>
      <p>The software also includes a separate Converter tool that offers a large selection of output options for popular devices and online uses, including FLV, MKV, and SWF.</p>

      <h3>Color Grading in VSCO</h3>
      <p>New for the latest major update of VSCO is color-wheel based color grading. This pro-level capability has been showing up in more and more prosumer editing apps over the past year or so. You access it from the Basic Effects panel's Hue Saturation curves section.</p>
      <p>There are six preset color dots (red, yellow, green, etc.), which, when clicked, add control points on the wheel. You can also use a dropper to isolate an exact color in your video. It's a powerful tool that lets you perform interesting effects like color pop, or just enhancing a sky. In addition to using the wheel, you can adjust colors with Photoshop-like RGB Curves and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV">YUV</a> curves. The program also supports LUT (look up table) presets, which can produce lighting effects like day-for-night and candlelight. Like the VirtualDub filters, you import these from the main button menu's Templates option.</p>
      <h3>Audio</h3>
      <p>You can add a soundtrack and apply several audio effects such as fade, chorus, delays, and low-pass filters. There's even a pitch change effect. I got into trouble, however, when I tried adding more than one effect to the audio, and sometimes I just heard silence. You can show audio waveforms on the timeline, but those are not adjustable. A Properties option lets you split audio from video.</p>
      <h3>Performance</h3>
      <p>VSDC offers good hardware rendering options, letting you specify Nvida and Intel architectures. I tested VSDC's rendering time by creating a movie consisting of five clips of mixed types (some 1080p, some SD, some 4K) with a standard set of transitions and rendered it to 1080p30 MPEG-4 at 15Mbps, H.264 High Profile. Audio was MPEG AAC Audio: 192 Kbps. I tested on the Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC running 64-bit Windows 10 Home (and sporting a 4K touch display), 16GB RAM, a quad-core Intel Core i7-6700T CPU, and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M discrete graphics card.</p>
      <p>The test movie (that played for just under 5 minutes) took 3:37 (min:sec) for VSDC Video Editor to render. That compares with just 1:34 for speed-leader PowerDirector and 1:39 for <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/video-editing/17620/pinnacle-studio-ultimate">Pinnacle Studio</a>. VSDC did beat Ashampoo Movie Studio Pro's 5:34 and Vegas Movie Studio's 6:19 handily, however.</p>
      <h3>360 Video</h3>
      <p>VSDC's 360-degree (aka VR) video editing capabilities are extremely rudimentary: You can convert (rather imperfectly, in my testing) from 360 to 2D format. You can't choose the point of view by dragging the mouse around the preview window, as you can in pretty much every other 360-supporting editor. You need to open the Properties panel and enter numbers for X angle and Y angle. VSDC's 3D video support is similarly limited, though that tech has fallen out of favor.</p>
      <h3>Sharing and Output</h3>
      <p>The number of output file options is impressive. VSDC even supports the relatively new H.265 codec, and an illustrated dropdown lets you choose popular devices to target with your output. Motion JPEG and animated GIFs are also options, but Blu-ray and even AVCHD are not options. There's a DVD-burning tool, but you get no help with creating menus or chapters. New for the 2019 version are options for iOS and Android video output.</p>
      <h3>Cheap, Powerful, Obtuse</h3>
      <p>If you really don't want to pay for a more-established video-editing program and don't mind digging into its less intuitive interface, VSDC Video Editor Pro can do some powerful things with your digital media. Features that worked well include picture-in-picture, transparency, and the effect filters. The app was still unstable in my testing, making it hard to recommend, despite how cheap it is. For both more ease of use and power, check out our Editors' Choice video editing software, Corel VideoStudio and CyberLink PowerDirector on the PC and <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/video-editing/19465/apple-final-cut-pro-x">Final Cut Pro X</a> on the Mac.</p>
