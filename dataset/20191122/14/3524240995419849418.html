      <h1>Pharmacists urge Nigerians to handle antibiotics with care</h1>

      <p>Some pharmacists have advised Nigerians to handle antibiotics with care by completing their prescribed dosage and avoid ingesting antibiotics without appropriate testing and prescription.</p>
      <p>According to them, this will help to guard against antibiotics resistance and associated health conditions that may arise from the indiscriminate consumption of antibiotics.</p>
      <p>They spoke on Friday at an event organised by the ST. RACHEAL’S Pharmaceutical Nigeria Ltd. to mark the 2019 World Antibiotics Awareness Week in Lagos.</p>
      <p>The <i>News Agency of Nigeria</i> reports that the 2019 WAAW is from November 18 to November 25.</p>
      <p>Commenting, Prof. Oyinlola Oduyebo of the Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, College of Medicine, University of Lagos (UNILAG), said “There is an urgent need for people to handle antibiotics with care.</p>
      <p>“Also, do not take leftover antibiotics; ensure you finish your antibiotics prescription instead of remaining and using it another time.</p>
      <p>“Many people have the habit of using what remains of the antibiotics they had used earlier; it is dangerous.’’</p>
      <p>According to her, when antibiotics are prescribed, its aim is to tackle a particular organism, hence, one needs to run a laboratory test to determine which organism is causing the ailment before taking any antibiotic.</p>
      <p>“So, when antibiotics meant to be taken for five days are taken for three days, it is dangerous; also, if one feels better after three days, that means the diagnosis for making prescriptions for that particular drug was not so accurate.</p>
      <p>“It also means that the antibiotics were not needed in the first instance.</p>
      <p>“The proper thing to do in treating infection is to target the organism causing that infection and this is first by subjecting the patient to clinical diagnosis through a laboratory test to find out what is causing it.’’</p>
      <p>She said that other reasons why drugs should be handled with care include avoiding drug resistance and adverse body reactions.</p>
      <p>“Indiscriminate consumption of antibiotics without an accurate diagnosis, strict adherence to prescriptions can cause drug resistance and even damage vital organs in the body.</p>
      <p>“You may take the antibiotics that may not be suitable for the condition, your body type, drugs combination or dosage and this can cause adverse reactions</p>
      <p>“Such adverse conditions may include organs failure and even death,’’ Oduyebo said.</p>
      <p>Also, Mr Akinjide Adeosun, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, ST. RACHEAL’S Pharmaceuticals Nigeria Ltd., urged Nigerians to preserve the longevity of the array of antibiotics.</p>
      <p>“The fundamental human right can be breached if we do not preserve the potency of the antibiotics we have today.</p>
      <p>“The 1946 WHO’s Constitution defines the right to health as the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health.</p>
      <p>“Consequently, there is a need to increase global awareness of antibiotic resistance and to raise awareness about the fatality of preventable and treatable respiratory tract infections.’’</p>
      <p>Adeosun, who is a Licenced Pharmacist, said that the effectiveness of antibiotics and the elimination of resistance could be encouraged by the right diagnosis and application of antibiotics.</p>
      <p>According to him, good hygiene, sanitation, correct dosing of antibiotics, renewed fight against counterfeit and substandard antibiotics as well as stoppage of self-medication of antibiotics can help improve the effectiveness of antibiotics and eliminate resistance.</p>
      <p>“Also, we will be helping the world in fighting the war against antibiotic resistance, thereby improving clinical outcomes and the life expectancy of antibiotics,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>Adeosun urged Nigerians to stop self-medication and take the full dose of high-quality antibiotics when prescribed by doctors and dispensed by pharmacists.</p>
      <p>He also urged governments to increase budgetary allocation to health.</p>
