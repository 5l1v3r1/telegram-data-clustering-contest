      <p>Lawrence Cedarhurst Fire Department Chief Edward Koehler said firefighters received a call from police at 2:49 a.m. Friday reporting smoke coming from the building.</p>
      <p>"We arrived in a couple minutes, found heavy fire conditions in the basement," said Koehler. "The building is an old building, believe it or not, and has a common basement with numerous partitions, storage. So (firefighters) met a lot of resistance at the very beginning."</p>
      <p>The fire spread through the basement to all the stores.</p>
      <p>Five stores, a restaurant, pizzeria, ice cream shop, pharmacy and cleaners, all sustained heavy fire and smoke damage.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, no injuries were reported.</p>
      <p>Koehler said the structure itself is safe, but for now the building is uninhabitable because firefighters had to cut a hole in the floor to get to the flames.</p>
      <p>The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p>
      <p>Central Avenue was closed in the area of Maple Avenue for fire department activity.</p>
