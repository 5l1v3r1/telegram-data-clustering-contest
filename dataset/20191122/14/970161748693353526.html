      <p>Nigel Farage has rejected the traditional manifesto and instead launched the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> Party’s ‘contract with the people.’</p>
      <p>The group has made a ‘clean-break Brexit’ one of their key ideas along with an immigration cap and a 50% cut in the foreign aid budget.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage acknowledged they were not seeking election as the next government after they pledged not to stand in Conservative-held constituencies.</p>
      <p>Instead, he claimed they were committed to achieving Brexit to give the UK ‘the freedom to shape our future.’</p>

      <p>The leader said: ‘A clean-break Brexit can shape the future of our economy and society.</p>
      <p>‘It will give us the freedom to shape our future by taking immediate control of our own laws, borders, money, fishing and defence.</p>

      <p>He added: ‘We need the Brexit Party to hold Boris Johnson to his word.</p>
      <p>‘We need the Brexit Party voice there in the House of Commons or we’re not going to get anything like what we voted for three-and-a-half years ago.’</p>

      <h3>Brexit Party’s policy document</h3>
      <p>Scrapping the BBC licence fee</p>
      <p>Allowing citizens to call referendums if five million people agree</p>
      <p>Abolishing inheritance tax</p>
      <p>Investing £2.5 billion in fishing and coastal communities</p>
      <p>Scrapping the House of Lords</p>

      <p>Mr Farage said their plans could be paid for by £200 billion of savings by cutting the foreign aid budget, ceasing EU payments and scrapping the HS2 high-speed rail link.</p>
      <p>On immigration, he said the UK was facing a ‘population crisis’ as a result of the policies which had been adopted in the 1990s.</p>

      <p>He said the numbers allowed to settle in the country should be capped at ‘about 50,000’ a year and he called for firm action to deter illegal immigrants trying to enter the country.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘We would very much want to get immigration numbers down to what for 60 years were very acceptable and very workable post-war levels.</p>
      <p>‘We think a strong message that says if you come here illegally across the Channel or in the back of a container that you wouldn’t be allowed to stay will prevent further human tragedy, and it’s the right thing to do.’</p>
