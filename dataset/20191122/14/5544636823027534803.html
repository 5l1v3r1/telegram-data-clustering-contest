      <p>Controversial rapper Raphael Omolayo better known as <a href="http://concisenews.global/entertainment/">Zlatan</a> has revealed that reality star, Tacha blocked him on social media platform, Twitter.</p>
      <p>Zlatan made this known while he stated that the last trouble he caused was ‘Kilorun’ audio he released in which he stylishly shaded Tacha.</p>
      <p>He however stated that it was time to cause another with the video he would release soon.</p>
      <p>The ‘Zanku’ crooner wrote” That Kilorun was the last trouble I caused, time to cause another one with a video I’m about to drop”</p>
      <p>In another tweet, Zlatan revealed that Tacha blocked her on the platform as the announcement of the video did not go well with her.</p>
      <p>“Seems Tacha blocked me, na only her I sabi for the house sha before she comot” the singer added.</p>
      <p>Recall that shortly after Tacha’s disqualification from the pepper dem edition of the show, <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/09/28/bbnaija-2019-zlatan-ibile-makes-mockery-of-tacha-in-new-song-video/">Zlatan released a diss track</a> for mocking the Instagram queen over ‘body odour’ claims.</p>
      <p>The rapper shared a footage on his Instagram handle, where he is seen spraying perfumes and saying “ki lo n run, Tacha ti wole” meaning “what is smelling, is Tacha in”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile,<a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/10/28/zlatan-ibile-publicly-declares-his-love-for-tacha/"> Tacha had reacted to the claims</a>, saying she loves Zlatan Ibile despite the singer mocking her with a diss track about ‘body odour.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Cool FM, Tacha said “I didn’t see it as anything, I like #Zlatan and I love his music, it’s all love,” she said.</p>
