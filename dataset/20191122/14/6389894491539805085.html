      <h1>Marks &amp; Spencer hires ex-Tesco exec to fix struggling clothing division</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:03:05+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:03</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Marks &amp; Spencer has named a new clothing boss to replace its ousted former head of the struggling division.</p>
      <p>Tesco’s former F&amp;F clothing chief Richard Price will join as M&amp;S’s new managing director of clothing home after Jill McDonald left the role in July.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Marks &amp; Spencer chief executive Steve Rowe criticised the unit for availability problems at the time.</p>
      <p>Rowe said today: “Richard’s career spans some of the UK’s top clothing brands and he has a proven track record of delivering growth through stylish, great value product. We are building a team of world class talent in clothing and home and, with Richard coming on board, I am confident that the speed and scale of the transformation of the business will accelerate.”</p>
      <p>The CEO took control of the embattled unit after McDonald’s departure to focus on turning it around.</p>
      <p>However, poor clothing sales still knocked Marks &amp; Spencer’s profit down 17 per cent in its latest half-year results earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Price previously worked at M&amp;S for seven years until he left in 2012 to become the managing director of failed department store chain BHS.</p>
      <p>During his previous stint at the company he oversaw a partnership with Savile Row tailor Richard James and was promoted to lead its menswear unit in 2008.</p>
      <p>“Marks &amp; Spencer Clothing &amp; Home is a great business which still has strong brand affection and huge potential,” Price said today.</p>

      <p>“I left the business because I felt it was drifting in the wrong direction but now feel we have a real chance to make it special again. The new team has already started to improve product and value and I am looking forward to working with them.”</p>
      <p>Price will not start until next year, with a start date yet to be set.</p>
      <p>Marks &amp; Spencer’s share price lifted 1.5 per cent to 189.7p following the announcement.</p>
