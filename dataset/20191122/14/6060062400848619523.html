        <li> "I know exactly who it is," said the president, describing the official as a "political operative." </li>
        <li>The hosts were keen to stress that they did not have confirmation of the identity of the whistleblower, whose identity is shielded under federal laws. </li>
        <li>"You don't need verification. You know exactly who it is," Trump replied.</li>

      <p>President Donald Trump in a lengthy and rambling interview on Fox News Friday accused the hosts of lying when they said they did not know the identity of the Ukraine whistleblower. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBwoDReTflI">In the interview on "Fox and Friends" Friday morning Trump attacked</a> Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who has led the impeachment probe sparked by the whistleblower's complaint.  </p>
      <p>"I want to see Adam Schiff testify about the whistleblower, who is a fake whistleblower," he said. "I know exactly who it is," and went on to call the official a "political operative." </p>
      <p>Hosts Steve Doocy, Brian Kilmeade, and Ainsley Earhardt then said they did not know the whistleblower's name, to which Trump replied: "I don't believe you."</p>
      <p>You can read the full exchange below: </p>
      <p><b>Steve Doocy:</b> "You said we know the name of the whistleblower, but we have no idea."</p>
      <p><b>Donald Trump:</b> "I don't believe you."</p>
      <p><b>Brian Kilmeade:</b> "OK."</p>
      <p><b>Doocy:</b> "We've seen names online but we have no verification."</p>
      <p><b>Trump:</b> "You don't need verification. You know exactly who it is."</p>
      <p>The president went on to accuse the hosts of lying as he sought to pressure them to conceding they knew the name of the alleged whistleblower.</p>
      <p>"I don't think Steve has ever told a lie, but that one? Come on," Trump said.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, conservative activists and media outlets have published the name of an official who they claim is the whistleblower in a bid to breach federal laws providing anonymity to whistleblower's. The whistleblower's attorneys say that exposing the individual's identity would put their life at risk. </p>
      <p>The president has attacked the official as a partisan operative and called on the media to name the person, but has so far backed away from doing so himself. </p>
      <p>Fox News has banned employees from using the name of the alleged whistleblower on air.</p>
      <p>Business Insider has been unable to verify the identity of the whistleblower, so is not publishing the name of the official alleged to be that person.</p>
      <p>In the interview, Trump also alleged that the impeachment probe is a partisan plot, and said that the results of an investigation into the origins of the Mueller probe would be "historic." </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-says-wants-always-corruption-in-fox-interview-2019-11?r=US&amp;IR=T">He also said "I do want corruption, always,"</a> in an apparent slip of the tongue when discussing unfounded allegations of corruption against Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden.</p>
