      <p>LOS ANGELES: The big reveal of <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/tesla-unveils-first-ever-electric-pickup-truck-12116836">Tesla's electric pick-up</a> went embarrassingly wrong when the supposedly impact-proof windows smashed, leaving a flustered Elon Musk to flounder through the rest of his presentation in front of a badly damaged vehicle.</p>
      <p>The Tesla co-founder unveiled the all-electric battery-powered Tesla Cybertruck in California on Thursday (Nov 21), daring staff to hit the vehicle with sledgehammers and showing a video of it withstanding bullets shot from a 9mm gun.</p>

      <p>But the demonstration of the vehicle's indestructible windows didn't appear to go entirely to plan after one assistant threw a steel ball bearing at the truck - only to see the armoured glass smash.</p>
      <p>An expletive could be heard at the Tesla Design Centre and as his assistant laughed nervously, Musk said: "Well, maybe that was a little too hard."</p>
      <p>A second attempt fared little better however, and another window was left badly damaged.</p>
      <p>"It didn't go through," said a clearly uncomfortable Musk, who was forced to push on through the remainder of the chaotic launch with the two smashed windows in full view.</p>
      <p>The industrial-looking Cybertruck is covered in the same steel alloy Musk plans to use for his SpaceX rocket and will be able to go from 0 to 100 km per hour in about three seconds, the Tesla chief executive claimed.</p>
      <p>He said the entry-level model will have a starting price of US$39,900 and a 400-km range, while a deluxe option will be able to travel twice the distance and will sell for US$69,900.</p>
      <p>No date has been given for its release but analysts said it would not be ready before the end of 2021 at the earliest.</p>

        <b>'ROOM FOR GROWTH'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tesla dominates the global electric car market and has an especially firm grip on the United States, where pick-ups are particularly popular.</p>
      <p>The California-based firm is hoping to edge in on domestic demand for larger car types such as pick-ups and sports utility vehicles, the margins for which have allowed manufacturers to cope with rising steel and aluminium costs.</p>
      <p>A lack of models in the pick-up class left "plenty of room for growth and for automakers to carve out new niches", said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of automotive website Edmunds.</p>
      <p>Caldwell suggested before the Cybertruck was unveiled that its design was likely to be "somewhat polarizing."</p>
      <p>"Tesla's built its brand around striking design and doing things differently, so they can't just trot out a truck that looks like a version of something else," she said.</p>
      <p>Musk said the vehicle's design had been inspired by the "cyberpunk" science fiction genre, including director Ridley Scott's classic 1982 film "Blade Runner".</p>
      <p>He had promised before the launch that Tesla's latest offering would cost less than US$50,000 - the average US price for pick-up vehicles - and that it would outperform the Ford F-150, the country's top-selling vehicle in the class.</p>
