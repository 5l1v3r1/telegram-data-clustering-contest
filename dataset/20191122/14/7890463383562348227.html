      <h1>Half-Life 3 “a terrifyingly daunting prospect,” says Valve</h1>

        <b>Valve might be re-awakening the Half-Life series with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-alyx/">Half-Life: Alyx</a> (and <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-alyx/new-half-life-games">possibly some other titles</a>) on the way, but it looks like the prospect of a Half-Life 3 is still a pretty scary one for Valve. That’s according to Valve designer Robin Walker, who has called Half-Life 3 “a terrifyingly daunting prospect”</b>
      </p>
      <p>In an interview with journalist Geoff Keighley (which you can check out below), Walker is asked why the upcoming Half-Life: Alyx, a full-length VR prequel to Half-Life 2, isn’t Half-Life 3. Valve dev Robin Walker replies: “In all honesty, back in 2016 when we started this, Half-Life was just terrifying. Half-Life 3 [was] a terrifyingly daunting prospect, and I think to some extent, VR was a way we could fool ourselves into believing we had a way to do this.</p>
      <p>“By starting with VR and then trying to think about Half-Life and how that worked with it, and playtesting those, you’re immediately in a space where we have something we understand well: Half-Life’s core gameplay, and a new platform with new prospects and new possibilities, and we can do that translation, and then we can watch people play it,” Walker continued.</p>
      <p>“It was really easy to not try and think about the big picture of like, ‘are we making Half-Life 3?’, and just focus on, let’s figure out what people enjoy in this and let’s make forward progress.” Walker explains that in some respects VR acted in a similar way to Half-Life 2’s gravity gun – that is, like a “tentpole” they could “wrap so much around.” But with “Half-Life 3, if it’s like, ‘hey, tomorrow you’re working on Half-Life 3,’ you’re like, ‘Oh god.’ Terrifying!”</p>

      <p>Despite it seeming “daunting” for its devs, Valve has said that it would “love to continue pushing forward” with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-alyx/new-half-life-games">Half-Life games</a>, so perhaps we will see a full <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-3/half-life-3-release-date-story-gameplay-art">Half-Life 3</a> arrive one day.</p>
      <p>In the meantime the <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-alyx/release-date">Half-Life: Alyx release date</a> is set for March 2020, so it won’t be too long before fans can jump back into Gordon Freeman’s universe once again.</p>
