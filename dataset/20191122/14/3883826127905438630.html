        <b>Liverpool defender Joe Gomez is "better than good" after a clash with England team-mate Raheem Sterling on international duty, says Jurgen Klopp.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Manchester City forward Sterling was dropped for the Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro on 14 November after "a disturbance in a private team area".</p>
      <p>But he returned for the qualifier in Kosovo three days later.</p>
      <p>"The people involved were fine pretty quick. Things like this happen in football," Liverpool boss Klopp said.</p>
      <p>"The FA dealt with it; I can't judge that. The players are absolutely OK."</p>
      <p>Sterling and Gomez had been involved in an on-field argument during Liverpool's 3-1 Premier League victory over City at Anfield on 10 November, just before the international break.</p>
      <p>City, fourth in the Premier League, are eight points behind leaders Liverpool, who can extend that advantage with a win <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50443051">at Crystal Palace</a> on Saturday (15:00 GMT).</p>
      <p>Sterling, who admitted <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50383693">"emotions got the better of me"</a> and apologised to Gomez and the rest of the England squad, is expected to play for City at home to Chelsea later in the day (17:30).</p>
      <p>City manager Pep Guardiola said: "We are good. I spoke with him and he's fine. He's an excellent guy.</p>
      <p>"He says Joe is an excellent guy and they have a good relationship."</p>
