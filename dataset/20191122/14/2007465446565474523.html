      <h1>All-new Chevrolet Trailblazer is now a crossover...in the US</h1>
      <h2>Your first look at the 2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer ACTIV</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:46:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/mikko-juangco.html" target="_blank">Mikko Juangco</a></address>
      <p>The Chevrolet Trailblazer has been a staple on our roads for a long time now. In more recent years, though, it hasn’t exactly blazed the trail design- and features-wise. Locally, it’s even been dubbed the clone of another SUV made in Japan (read mu-X). Chevy’s out to change that notion the world over, though.</p>
      <p>Here you see the 2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer ACTIV.</p>

      <p>Let’s admit it, this looks so much more current, and so much better than its current iteration. To some who may have seen our previous item, the front takes on the same appearance as its bigger midsize brother, the Blazer. For this specific variant, it features a new interpretation of the signature dual-port grill, which now has a larger opening to make it look more rugged. The accent bar is likewise integrated with the headlights, making the Trailblazer look a lot wider.</p>
      <p>The sides also take on wider panels with a few angular creases. Those along with its sleek roofline and clamshell design hood give it a bolder look and at the same time younger character.</p>

      <p>Inside, we also see a redesign into a more driver-centric dual cockpit design. Across the Trailblazer range, Chevy made use of high-quality materials complimented by contrast stitching all around – all different depending on variant.</p>
      <p>The Trailblazer’s center stack also features integrated controls for both air conditioning and entertainment. The latter being it now comes with Chevy’s latest infotainment system. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto now come standard, plus the ability to connect two phones via Bluetooth, hands-free telephony, and SiriusXM with 360L which delivers both a satellite and streaming listening experience with more SiriusXM channels than ever before.</p>

      <p>Most noteworthy is the fact that Chevy seems to have done away with the third row of seats. By the looks of it, the Trailblazer will now be a five-seater compared to the 7-seater configuration of older models.</p>
      <p>The middle row features a 60:40 split, making it easy to accommodate cargo of up to 8.5 feet long; it also ups the cargo space to 1540 liters. A hands-free tailgate is also equipped to provide ease of loading and unloading of cargo.</p>

      <p>It’s also interesting how Chevrolet is changing up the power plants for the new Trailblazer. As of writing, only a 1.2 turbo or 1.3 turbo exist as engine options – delivering up to 155 horsepower. Both engines are mated to a standard CVT, but the 1.3-powered version has a 9-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive available as options.</p>
      <p>The Trailblazer is available with Chevy’s selectable AWD, also found in the Blazer and Traverse. Selectable AWD allows drivers to decide whether to activate their AWD system in off-road or inclement weather situations, or to deactivate when AWD performance is not required, to achieve improved fuel economy.</p>
      <p>Details on specific variants and their pricing have yet to be released by Chevrolet.</p>
      <p>The all-new Chevrolet Trailblazer is expected to hit US showrooms in 2020. If the bowtie brand is looking at perhaps strengthening its hold in the ASEAN market and even in the Philippines, perhaps this gives them a fighting chance in the SUV segment.</p>
