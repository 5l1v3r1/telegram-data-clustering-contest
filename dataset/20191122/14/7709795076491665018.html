      <h3>TRENDS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>9/10 WINNERS – 7 or less hurdles starts</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>9/10 WINNERS – Aged 5 or 6</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>8/10 WINNERS – Started at single-figure odds</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>7/10 WINNERS – Finished 1st, 2nd or 3rd last-time-out</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>BETTRENDS SELECTION: LISNAGAR OSCAR</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is a race which favours a young and up-and-coming, lightly-raced hurdler and there are plenty towards the head of the market that fit the profile. However, the one who matches all four key trends is <b>LISNAGAR OSCAR</b>, who reverts back to hurdles after a disappointing run at Stratford. He still managed to finish third on that occasion and won over course-and-distance in February, when he had several of Saturday’s opponents in behind.</p>
      <p>This looks a really competitive renewal – as you would expect for the money – and <b>Umbrigado </b>is another to take very seriously. He bids to provide David Pipe with a fourth win in the race since 2010 and like six of the past 10 winners, he will be having his first start at the trip.</p>
