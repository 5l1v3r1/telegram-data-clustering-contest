      <p><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest">Tesla</a> is cracking under pressure, much like the windows on its electric truck.</p>
      <p>Shares of the electric-vehicle company fell as much as 4.1% in early trading Friday after it revealed its electric truck, called the Cybertruck, in a live event Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>The truck has long been <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/230487450882019328">hyped</a> by CEO Elon Musk for its futuristic design, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-pickup-truck-cybertruck-reveal-how-to-watch-details-2019-11-1028708616">inspired by the movie “Blade Runner.”</a> During the live demonstration, however, things took an unexpected turn when Tesla’s lead designer Franz von Holzhausen threw a metal ball at <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/video-tesla-cybertruck-launch-blooper-armour-windows-smashed-oops-2019-11">not one but two of the truck’s “armor glass” windows, smashing them</a>.</p>
      <p>Musk was caught off guard and uttered an expletive before saying the ball “didn’t go through – that’s a plus side,” and telling the audience that Tesla would fix the problem “in post.”</p>
      <p>The unveiling of the Tesla Cybertruck comes as competition in electric vehicles heats up. Recently, Ford <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/ford-mustang-electric-vehicle-suv-reveal-la-auto-show-2019-10-1028629109?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest">unveiled its own mustang-inspired electric SUV</a>, called the <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2019/11/14/ford-mustang-mach-e-newest-member-of-mustang-family.html">Mach-E,</a> which analysts at Credit Suisse said <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/credit-suisse-ford-mach-e-could-pose-threat-to-tesla-2019-11-1028690751">could threaten Tesla’s position as the top EV maker in the US</a>.</p>
      <p>In addition, General Motors CEO Mary Barra announced Thursday that the company’s electric pickup truck <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/general-motors-to-sell-electric-pickup-truck-in-2021-2019-11">will launch in 2021, Reuters reported</a>. That’s around the same time that Tesla’s Cybertruck will hit the market, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Tesla has gained about <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest">6% year-to-date through Thursday’s close</a>.</p>
