      <p>Moukoko has been impressive for the German football league academy after showing the quality he was made of last season.</p>
      <p>According to Sport Bible, the forward made his U17 debut at the age of 12, and currently averages at least a goal in every 54 minutes in this Bundesliga U19 season.</p>

      <p>Although Lionel Messi is Moukoko's idol, the forward has replicated Cristiano Ronaldo's celebration when he scores.</p>
