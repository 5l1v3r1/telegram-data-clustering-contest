      <h1>Jose Mourinho strolls through Chelsea in full Tottenham kit after Premier League return</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho has been spotted walking around Chelsea for the first time since his shock appointment as the new Tottenham manager, replacing Mauricio Pochettino</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:33:12+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:33</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>New Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho has been pictured strolling around London for the first time since securing his Premier League return.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was unveiled as the new Spurs boss on Wednesday morning, less than 24 hours after the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>He took his first training session on Wednesday afternoon and held his first press conference on Friday.</p>
      <p>Now, he has been seen strolling down the street in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> area where he lives, donning a full Spurs tracksuit complete with navy gilet as he carried a small suitcase in his left hand.</p>
      <p>Mourinho's appointment has not gone down well with Chelsea fans after he had previously said he would never manage their rivals.</p>
      <p>But he had no qualms with walking around the area in the gear of his new club after a whirlwind few days as he took time out to sign a shirt for a fan.</p>

      <p>Four years ago, Mourinho said: ‘I would not take the job because I love Chelsea supporters too much.’</p>
      <p>But he addressed those comments directly in his first press conference, claiming things changed due to his second sacking at Stamford Bridge.</p>

      <p>"Four years ago when you were at Chelsea you were asked whether you would come to Spurs and you said: 'Never, I love the Chelsea fans too much'. What’s changed?" he was asked.</p>
      <p>With a smirk on his face, Mourinho replied: "[That was] before I was sacked!"</p>

      <p>Mourinho also appeared to aim a subtle dig at Chelsea and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> in an introductory video released by Spurs.</p>
      <p>Discussing his desire to bring through young players - something he has been accused of not doing enough of in the past - he said: "There is not one manager in the world that doesn't like to play young players and to help young players to develop - not one.</p>

      <p>"The problem is that sometimes you get into clubs where the work that is below you is not good enough to produce these players.</p>
      <p>"So I look to our history and you see that the academy is always giving talents the first team need. Of course I always look forward to working with that profile."</p>
