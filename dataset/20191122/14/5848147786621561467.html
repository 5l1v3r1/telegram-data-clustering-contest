      <h1>Millman left devastated after Canada loss</h1>

      <p>A devastated John Millman has shouldered the blame for Australia’s Davis Cup quarter-final defeat following his singles rubber defeat to Vasek Pospisil.</p>
      <p>The Queenslander was a late addition to the side to face the Canadians after Nick Kyrgios pulled out of the match due to a collarbone injury an hour before the start of the tie.</p>
      <p>Millman began well but squandered a break and then two set points in a tense first-set tiebreak on his way to a 7-6 (9-7) 6-4 defeat as Canada got off to the perfect start.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old was inconsolable after leaving the Centre Court at the Caja Magica in Madrid and sat with a towel over his head for several minutes as he tried to take in the defeat.</p>
      <p>“I had a few hours to prepare, but there’s no excuses from my end,” Millman said.</p>
      <p>“That performance is on me. I couldn’t have been better prepared from Lleyton and the coaching staff. Yeah, that’s on me.</p>
      <p>“There were a few points in it but In the best-of-three set format, that can happen.</p>
      <p>“Obviously, it’s a little more disappointing when you have those chances and you don’t take them but this one just hurt a lot.”</p>
      <p>Alex de Minaur produced yet another brilliant display to underline his credentials once more as one of the world’s most exciting players with victory over fellow young gun Denis Shapovalov.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old Australian No.1 came from a set down to win 3-6 6-4 7-5 to level the tie at 1-1 and spark wild celebrations from the Australian bench.</p>
      <p>However, it proved to be short lived and John Peers and Jordan Thompson lost the doubles to Shapovalov and Vasek Pospisil in straight sets to hand Canada a 2-1 victory.</p>

      <p>De Minaur, who has now won 41 matches in 2019 said the win gave him mixed feelings as it was in a losing cause.</p>
      <p>“I was going to do everything in my power to try to give myself chances and fight till the end, and, you know, that’s what I did,” de Minaur said.</p>
      <p>“It ended up going my way and it was good to turn that one around but the team winning is the most important thing.”</p>
