      <h2>As part of our End of the Decade series, we pay tribute to the late Cheick Tiote who made quite an impact at Newcastle United between 2010 and 2017</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:38:46+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:38</time> by <a rel="author">Ciaran Kelly</a></address>
      <p>Moving to Newcastle United was an easy decision for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/cheick-tiote">Cheick Tiote</a> . Didier Drogba was among those who advised his friend to test himself at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/st-james-park">St James' Park</a> and the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> legend rightly predicted his compatriot would relish the cut and thrust of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Tiote could have stayed put at Twente, playing in the Champions League, but he wanted to follow in the footsteps of his idol, Michael Essien, and play in England week in week out. And he quickly made an impact following his £3.5m move to the Magpies in 2010.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/joey-barton">Joey Barton</a> never forgot that first day, that first crunching tackle from Tiote at Benton, and it set the tone for the midfielder's time at the club; Tiote played with the same intensity and hunger, whether it was a training session or a competitive game.</p>
      <p>Tiote relished the combative nature of the Premier League and while new signings often need time to adjust to playing in England, the midfielder immediately hit the ground running with a fine debut against Everton.</p>

      <p>A soft-spoken individual, Tiote turned into something very different when he put on his boots and crossed the white line as Jean Musampa, his agent of five years, recalled.</p>
      <p>"Cheick, what can I say about him? A very good guy, a very good character," he told ChronicleLive. "He always gave 100%, in games, in training. That was Cheick. He was a fighter. Newcastle was a big club, a big step, so when he came to the building, he just wanted to sign.</p>
      <p>"He would really care about you. He would call you two or three times a day just to say hello and check everything was OK with you. He had a good heart.</p>
      <p>"He was somebody who would share everything. When Cheick had money, he would share it with people around him. I think that is what I will remember about him. He was not greedy. He was somebody if he could help you, he <i>would </i> help you."</p>
      <p>Tiote's first season at St James' Park was arguably his best at the club. It was in that maiden campaign that Tiote scored *that* goal against Arsenal, which forever secured his place in Geordies' hearts <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/history/newcastle-united-memories-four-years-8589483">following the Magpies' astonishing comeback from 4-0 down</a> .</p>

        <figcaption>A moment Newcastle United fans will never forget</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Everyone can still recall that moment, that celebration, as Tiote scored what proved to be his only goal in 156 appearances in black-and-white. A 25-yard volley with three minutes to go? That was some way to do it.</p>
      <p>After Andy Carroll completed his British record move to Liverpool the previous month, Alan Pardew told Mike Ashley and Derek Llambias that Tiote was the club's most important player and tying him down to a new contract would be a statement in itself. Newcastle's top brass listened.</p>
      <p>Tiote spent another six years on Tyneside, going on to captain the club on occasion, and continued to send money to his family back home.</p>
      <p>Indeed, one of the reasons Tiote eventually moved to China in 2017 was to fulfil a dream and look after his extended family so they were secure for life.</p>
      <p>Tragically, just five months after completing his switch to Beijing Enterprises, Tiote suffered a fatal heart attack while training with his new club. The football world was united in shock. How could this happen to such a fit young man, a 30-year-old with his whole life ahead of him?</p>

      <p>Tiote's family, friends and team-mates, past and present, somehow steeled themselves to say goodbye as a memorial service and funeral were held in China and the Ivory Coast respectively.</p>
      <p>A recurring word, warrior, fittingly cropped up in tributes from across the globe and while Tiote is no longer with us, those he touched will never forget him.</p>
      <p>"When he passed away, I went to the Ivory Coast to his last house for the funeral," Musampa added. "Even though we were not working together anymore, that was something I had to do at the time because of all the memories we had together, because he was a very important person for me.</p>
      <p>"I still have a lot of pictures in my office of him. I haven't taken them down so Cheick is still present in my life."</p>
