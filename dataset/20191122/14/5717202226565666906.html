      <h1>Leeds fans react as club linked with a move for Burnley striker Matej Vydra</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:15:41+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Leeds United are reportedly looking to bring Burnley striker Matej Vydra to Elland Road in the January transfer window after being previously linked with the Czech Republic international in the summer of 2018 – and Leeds fans have reacted on Twitter.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/">The Daily Mirror have claimed</a> in their paper edition on November 22 (page 74) that Leeds are eying a cut-price move for the ex-Watford and Derby striker. Burnley bought Vydra for £11million, but are willing to sell him for £7.5million.</p>
      <p>Leeds tried to sign Vydra from Derby during Marcelo Bielsa’s first summer at the club, after he had scored 22 goals in 44 league and cup appearances during the 2017-18 campaign. But his wage demands prevented Leeds from landing the striker.</p>

      <p>Instead, Leeds opted to sign Patrick Bamford from Middlesbrough and the ex-Chelsea ace has since impressed – albeit with lengthy spells on the sidelines through injury and a recent goal drought. He is thought of highly by Leeds supporters.</p>
      <p>Vydra, meanwhile, realised his Premier League dream with a move to Sean Dyche’s Burnley. However, he has managed just three Premier League starts since his move – scoring only one goal.</p>
      <p>Leeds fans reacted to the reported news that their club are interested in landing Vydra in the January window despite already boasting both Bamford and Nketiah – and some Whites fans believe Vydra would be a superb signing, while others do not.</p>
