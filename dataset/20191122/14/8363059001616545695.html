      <p>Black Friday season is in full swing right now, with deals popping up all over the place. Those deals also include Lego, though so far most of the discounts have been pretty samey and not all that interesting. That said, John Lewis has bundled some stuff together, <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/browse/baby-child/construction-toys/lego/_/N-44gfZ1z140g1?sortBy=priceHigh">and that has got our attention.</a></p>
      <p>The bundles seem to be a case of buying a big set full price, and then getting an extra set thrown in absolutely free. Usually it's small set that's somehow related to that theme, but a free set is a free set, right? Bundles include:</p>
