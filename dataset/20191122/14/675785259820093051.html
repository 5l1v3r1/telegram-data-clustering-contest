      <h2>The Portuguese star reacted furiously after being substituted in the 1-0 win over AC Milan earlier this month and reportedly left the stadium before the final whistle</h2>

      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo will not play any part in Juventus' game against Atalanta on Saturday after he was left out of Maurizio Sarri's squad for the match.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old scored a hat-trick against Lithuania and one goal against Luxembourg while on international duty with Portugal to move him to 99 goals for his country.</p>
      <p>But prior to international duty he was substituted in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> ' wins against Lokomotiv Moscow and AC Milan, appearing angry both times he was replaced, and it later transpired he was frustrated at a niggling injury.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo recently admitted that he has been playing with the injury for both club and country, saying: "I tried to help Juventus even playing injured. Nobody likes to be substituted, but I understand the substitutions because I wasn't fit.</p>

      <p>"As well as in the last two games for Portugal, I wasn't 100 per cent. When it's needed to sacrifice myself for my club and the national team, I do full of pride. I knew there were many things involved in these games."</p>
      <p>Even though Ronaldo appears desperate to play through his injury, Sarri has decided to rest him for the game against Atalanta, and seemed to suggest the five time Ballon d'Or winner was in need of a break.</p>
      <p>"There's no need to clarify anything with Ronaldo. Certain players need to be left to cool off," Sarri said.</p>

      <p>"The problem is that, on Tuesday, he told us that he was still not feeling good. Our objective is to have him back for the Champions League. I'm 99 percent sure he won't make it tomorrow."</p>
      <p>Juventus currently lead Inter Milan by a point at the top of Serie A, and they also have a crucial Champions League game against Atletico Madrid on Tuesday, which Ronaldo could return for.</p>
