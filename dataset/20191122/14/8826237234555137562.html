First, it must be constructed from 172 pieces, including gears, motors, and sound sensors. A colorful manual alongside a comic-book story will guide you through the process. But building it is only half the fun. Once you’re done, the bionic hedgehog responds to sound commands. Different patterns of claps make it bristle, tumble, spin, and more.<br/>(Ages 7+) <b>Buy Now: </b><a href="https://amzn.to/2pvMLxZ">My Robotic Pet—Tumbling Hedgehog</a></p>
