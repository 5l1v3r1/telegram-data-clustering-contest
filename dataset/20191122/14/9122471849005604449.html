      <h1>NFL Insider Offers Injury Update For Steelers RB James Conner</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:55:18+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Last Thursday night, the Cleveland Browns hosted the Pittsburgh Steelers in a pivotal match-up between AFC North foes. All of the attention after the game was focused on the incident between Myles Garrett and Mason Rudolph.</p>
      <p>While that held significant consequences for both teams, there were three key injuries to the Steelers offense that were overlooked.</p>
      <p>Star running back James Conner, wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster and fellow wide receiver Diontae Johnson all left the game with injuries.</p>
      <p>Conner, who suffered a shoulder injury four weeks ago against the Miami Dolphins, re-injured the shoulder. Smith-Schuster and Johnson also both left the game with concussions.</p>
      <p>NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport has some bad news for Steelers fans about their star offensive players.</p>
      <p>Rapoport suggested Conner will NOT play this weekend and it doesnâ€™t look good for JuJu either.</p>

      <p>Conner and Smith-Schuster have not practiced at all this week. However, the rookie wide receiver has been at practice this week. Johnson still needs to pass the concussion protocol before he can take the field this weekend.</p>
      <p>The good news for the Steelers is they play a horrific Cincinnati Bengals team searching for its first win.</p>
      <p>Can the Steelers overcome their injuries and get the win? Stay tuned.</p>
