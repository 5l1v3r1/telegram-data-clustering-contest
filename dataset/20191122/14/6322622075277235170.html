      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 22): China-based footwear manufacturer Xidelang Holdings Ltd’s net profit for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 (3QFY19) rose 39.3% to RMB8.33 million (RM4.94 million) from RMB5.98 million a year ago, on higher average unit selling prices.</p>
      <p>Its earnings per share improved to 0.46 sen from 0.34 sen for 3QFY18, according to the company’s filing with Bursa Malaysia.</p>
      <p>Revenue was flat at RMB121.39 million from RMB120.26 million.</p>
      <p>For its nine-month period (9MFY19), its net profit climbed nearly 30% to RMB21.2 million from RMB16.35 million. While revenue inched up 2.75% to RMB347.74 million from RMB338.42 million.</p>
      <p>On prospects, the company said the industry’s outlook for the near term is anticipated to experience some volatility due to economic uncertainties arising from the on-going trade dispute between the US and China.</p>
      <p>However, the group is cautiously optimistic that China's sportswear industry in the mid and long term will remain resilient and achieve stable and healthy development.</p>
      <p>Xidelang’s shares closed unchanged at eight sen, bringing it a market capitalisation of RM144.39 million. The counter saw some 4.85 million shares done.</p>
