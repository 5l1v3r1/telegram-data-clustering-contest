      <h1>These stores will be closed on Thanksgiving</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:43:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:43</time> by <a rel="author">Jenn Savedge</a></address>
      <p>Several years ago, big-box giant Walmart surprised the country by announcing its <a href="https://www.mnn.com/money/sustainable-business-practices/blogs/the-walmart-black-friday-sale-starts-thursday">Black Friday sales would start on Thanksgiving night</a>. Die-hard Black Friday shoppers cheered the decision, while die-hard turkey day enthusiasts claimed the move destroyed the meaning of the Thanksgiving holiday and forced both employees and customers to abandon their families.</p>
      <p>The two sides have battled ever since, as more and more stores have jumped on the early-sales game. But the tide might finally be turning. In recent years, a number of stores have announced they will be closed on Thanksgiving Day. And at least one is taking things even further, remaining closed for Black Friday, too.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://bestblackfriday.com/blog/stores-closed-on-thanksgiving-2019/">Bestblackfriday.com</a> and <a href="https://www.theblackfriday.com/stores-closed-on-thanksgiving-day.php">TheBlackFriday.com</a>, these stores will keep their doors closed on Thanksgiving Day 2019:</p>

      <h3>Family time (and online shopping) rule</h3>

      <p>Many companies have offered similar explanations for keeping stores closed on Thanksgiving Day. Store managers want their employees and customers to have time to spend with their families, time that's not interrupted because an employee has to go to work or because a shopper doesn't want to miss out on holiday sales. That's a message many shoppers will likely reward when stores do open on Black Friday.</p>
      <p>In 2015, outdoor retailer REI bucked the holiday shopping trend even further by announcing all of its stores would be closed on Thanksgiving and also on Black Friday. Instead, REI encouraged its employees and customers to <a href="https://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/blogs/reis-black-friday-shuttering-expands-welcome-retail-trend">#OptOutside</a>, for a weekend connected with family and nature. That move resulted in 1 million new memberships for the store.</p>
      <p>According to a poll conducted by BestBlackFriday.com, almost 72% of shoppers think stores should be closed on Thanksgiving Day. This coincides with a <a href="https://www.shoppertrak.com/media/press-release/retail-traffic-thanksgiving-day-black-friday-levels/">report</a> released several years ago that found shopping at brick-and-mortar stores had decreased on both Black Friday and Thanksgiving Day.</p>
      <p>With Americans reluctant to give up their post-turkey family time in search of the best deals, and with many stores now offering "doorbuster" sales online, it's no wonder cybershopping has become the name of the game for the holiday season. While foot traffic decreased at many stores on Black Friday in past years, <a href="http://news.adobe.com/press-release/marketing-cloud/media-alert-adobe-data-shows-black-friday-breaks-online-sales-record-3">Adobe reported</a> that online Black Friday sales brought in $6.2 billion in online sales in 2018, a growth of 23.6% from 2017.</p>
      <p>The trend to lure shoppers in early by kicking off Black Friday sales on Thanksgiving Day may finally be turning, as more shoppers are skipping the crowds and doing their shopping — no matter the day — from home.</p>
