      <p>Prince Andrew and the Queen have been pictured riding horses - in their first public appearance together since the Duke stepped down from royal duties.</p>
      <p>Andrew, 59, and his mother, 93, were suitable attired in waterproof clothing as they rode on the animals through the Windsor Castle estate this morning.</p>
      <p>The pair were joined by two others.</p>
      <p>Their outing comes days after the Duke of York announced he would be stepping down from public duties "for the foreseeable future" following the furore over his BBC Newsnight interview.</p>
      <p>The Queen was reported to be "disappointed" and "unhappy" with how the TV appearance unfolded.</p>

      <p>During the grilling, by host Emily Maitlis, he discussed his friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, and denied allegations he slept with a teen trafficking victim.</p>
      <p>"I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever," he said.</p>
      <p>Andrew was also snapped last night looking <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-prince-andrew-looks-shell-20932207">shell-shocked</a> as he drove away from the palace following a 'crisis summit'.</p>
      <p>Wearing a suit and tie, he was seen driving away from the palace with a serious expression on his face.</p>

      <p>When he left his family home to head to the palace earlier in the day, he smiled and waved from behind the wheel of his car.</p>
      <p>Andrew quit his life as a working royal on Wednesday evening over his association with Epstein.</p>
      <p>In the bombshell statement he said: "It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family's work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support.</p>
      <p>"Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission.</p>

      <p>"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>"His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.</p>
      <p>"I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, asked if the Duke of York was right to step back from public life, Prime Minister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> told reporters on a visit to Bedfordshire: "All I can say is that it is very important that all the victims of Jeffrey Epstein get justice and the law must be done and must be seen to be done."</p>
      <p>Following Saturday night's Newsnight interview, Andrew was criticised for showing a lack of empathy towards Epstein's alleged victims and a lack of remorse over his friendship with the pervert, who killed himself in a New York prison while facing child sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>Andrew has repeatedly denied claims that he had sex with Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre (nee Roberts) on three occasions when she was a teen.</p>
      <p>Mrs Giuffre, now 36 and living in Australia, claims she was groomed and forced to have sex with Epstein and his friends.</p>
      <p>Andrew claims an alleged encounter in 2001 did not happen, as he spent the day with his daughter, Princess Beatrice, taking her to Pizza Express in Woking for a party.</p>
