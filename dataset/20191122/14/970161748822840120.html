      <p>A restaurant was shut down after health inspectors found 60 live cockroaches inside a microwave in its kitchen.</p>
      <p>Parallel China Express in Kansas City, Kansas was temporarily closed by the Kansas Department of Agriculture after two failed inspections in late October and early November found an apparent cockroach infestation.</p>
      <p>The inspector found six ‘priority’ violations when they visited the restaurant on October 29, noting five live roaches in the dish area and 30 live roaches on the cooks’ line, on the wall and in equipment.</p>
      <p>Roaches were also found in holes in the ceiling and wall, behind the steam table and in reach of the cooler. The restaurant’s latest pest invoice did not indicate any roach activity, according to <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/business/biz-columns-blogs/cityscape/article237246579.html">the Kansas City Star.</a></p>
      <p>The restaurant had a reopening inspection on the next day, but the inspector found about a dozen live roaches, although the restaurant’s manager provided a pest control invoice for October 29.</p>

      <p>The microwave was taken outside and pest control was contacted.</p>
      <p>According to the inspector, a ‘deep cleaning of the establishment has taken place.’</p>
      <p>The restaurant reportedly had no violations during a November 3 reopening inspection. It was allowed to open but will be inspected later this month.</p>
