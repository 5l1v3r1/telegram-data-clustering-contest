      <h1>Klopp sweating on Salah fitness ahead of Palace trip</h1>

      <p>Liverpool manager, Juergen Klopp, faces an anxious wait over the fitness of forward Mohamed Salah as the Premier League leaders prepare for a trip to Crystal Palace on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Egyptian forward Salah has been struggling with an ankle injury since a heavy challenge from Leicester City’s Hamza Choudhury during Liverpool’s 2-1 win early last month.</p>
      <p>He was ruled out of Egypt’s matches against Kenya and Comoros and was pictured wearing a protective boot on his left ankle last week.</p>
      <p>“Yesterday he trained. He has been training the things we want him to do. It’s not that he has got worse, it’s just that the injury is there still.</p>
      <p>“We have to be sensible. I have to see the session today before I make a decision,” Klopp told a news conference on Friday.</p>
      <p>Virgil van Dijk is available for selection after he pulled out of the Netherlands squad for the match against Estonia in midweek.</p>
      <p>But Klopp is yet to assess the fitness of other key players who have returned from international duty.</p>
      <p>“Virgil is 100% available. I cannot say 100% for the others.</p>
      <p>“Today is an important session with the players who came back late – Bobby (Roberto Firmino), Fabinho, Gini Wijnaldum. You have to wait until the last second to make a decision but nobody came back injured,” the coach added.</p>
      <p>Swiss playmaker Xherdan Shaqiri has returned to first-team training after missing over a month due to a recurring calf issue.</p>
      <p>Shaqiri has featured for around 25 minutes for Liverpool this season and has made only one start since January but Klopp is convinced the player still has a future at Anfield and will play a key role in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>“When I am with him he is fine here, speculation is speculation and nothing we can change.</p>
      <p>“I have no idea what I can say about it. He absolutely has a future here. This season, he is a very, very important player for us. He needs to be fit for the impact he can give us and that is all we are focused on,” Klopp said.</p>
