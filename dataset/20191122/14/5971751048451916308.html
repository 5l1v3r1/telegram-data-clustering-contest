      <p>Nokia Mobile just teased that the new member of Nokia phones is coming on December 5th.</p>
      <p>They shared a video that could suggest a device that will be intended for joggers, or folks that like trail races. The video could also suggest that the device will be able to endure a lot or have the energy to last for more than two days.</p>

      <p>Anyway, in the past few weeks, we saw many TA- model numbers passing various certification processes, so whatever it is, in two weeks weâ€™ll know everything. The only thing I found out about this event is that it will be organized in Cairo, Egypt. For more info weâ€™ll have to stay tuned ðŸ™‚</p>
      <p>Here is the same teaser video but shared over YouTube.</p>
