      <p>Dylan Harrison, who is challenging The Wrekin seat for Labour, was outside Telford College's Haybridge campus in Wellington speaking to students as they headed into their lectures.</p>
      <p>"It was great to meet with students at Telford College this morning," he said.</p>
      <p>"I am trying to meet as many people across the constituency as possible during the campaign.</p>
      <p>"We had a good reception from students and encouraged as many as possible to register to vote.</p>
      <p>"Students are concerned about their future employment and about the impact of climate change."</p>
      <p>Mr Harrison will be challenging Conservative Mark Pritchard, who has held the seat since 2005.</p>
      <p>Mr Pritchard will be defending a majority of 9,564. Also standing will be Liberal Democrat Thomas Janke.</p>
