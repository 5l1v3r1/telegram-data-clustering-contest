      <p><i>“Our message is clear and simple, Oshiomhole must leave. Enough is enough, he must go. He has not been using his diplomacy to solve the problems in the party. This has cost us to lose a lot of states such as Oyo State, <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/zamfara-state-news-today.html">Zamfara State</a>, Bauchi State, and other states,”</i> Abubakar Alihu, who described himself as a member of the party and one of the leaders.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“What happened in Zamfara really hurt us because we won the election initially but the court gave the verdict to the PDP due to the fact that APC chairman messed up in some aspects and failed to tackle those aspects.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>The protesters were later countered by thugs coming from the street where the APC secretariat is located.</p>
      <p>The thugs reportedly threw stones and sticks to disperse the demonstrators.</p>

      <p>Oshiomhole, a former governor of Edo, has been in a running political battle with his successor, Godwin Obaseki, with analysts warning that this may result in the APC losing the state in the 2020 governorship election.</p>
      <p>The Nation reports that the Edo caucus of the National Assembly passed the vote of confidence shortly after the APC national leadership appointed Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano to head a five-man committee on the crisis.</p>
