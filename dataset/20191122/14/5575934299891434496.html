      <p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren came out swinging at Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and President Donald Trump in a tweet on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“Amid antitrust scrutiny, Facebook is going on a charm offensive with Republican lawmakers. And now, Mark Zuckerberg and one of Facebook’s board members – a major Trump donor – had a secret dinner with Trump,” <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1197516769285615616">she said</a>. “This is corruption, plain and simple.”</p>
      <p>Warren’s criticism comes in response to news that Zuckerberg and Trump <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-had-undisclosed-dinner-donald-trump-2019-11">met for a private dinner</a> while the Facebook CEO was in Washington D.C. last month.</p>
      <p>“This is how the government keeps working for giant corporations and the wealthy and well-connected,” she said. “It’s no wonder that companies like Facebook have been allowed to consolidate economic and political power without any real accountability.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-hosted-zuckerberg-undisclosed-dinner-white-house-october-n1087986">NBC News reported on Thursday</a> that Trump and Zuckerberg had dinner in October, which was previously unknown. Facebook confirmed the report.</p>
      <p>In addition to Trump and Zuckerberg, Facebook board member and controversial investor and entrepreneur Peter Thiel was also part of the dinner.</p>
      <p>Thiel cofounded PayPal and Palantir, and more recently, was behind the lawsuit that shut down Gawker. He’s been a longtime Facebook board member, and was an early investor in the company. He’s also an outspoken Libertarian and Trump supporter.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time Zuckerberg and Trump have privately met – the two <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zuckerberg-held-an-unannounced-meeting-with-trump-during-dc-visit-2019-9">had a surprise meeting in September 2018</a> when Zuckerberg was in D.C. meeting with lawmakers on behalf of Facebook.</p>
      <p>It’s unlikely to be the last time they will meet, as Facebook faces scrutiny from government regulators for a variety of things: Controversy around political ads on its social media services, the introduction of a new currency named Libra, and various antitrust concerns.</p>
