      <h1>G-Shock expands elite MR-G range with Bluetooth support for uber-precise timekeeping</h1>
      <h2>Right on time</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T14:13:37+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 14:13</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kerr</a></address>
      <p>G-Shock has updated its elite MR-G range of premium watches with a new bluetooth connected model that promises to combine "extreme toughness with sophisticated design." Although it could probably use a catchier name, the new <a href="https://g-shock.co.uk/mrg-b1000d-1adr">MRG-B1000D-1AER (Â£2,200</a>) impresses elsewhere, and manages to squash all the original technology of its predecessors into a new miniaturised case structure that's compact and sleek. It's also a bit of a looker in monocrome set against subtle pops of colour. By far the standout feature, however, is its ability to receive time calibration signals via a bluetooth connection to maintain an impeccably precise time setting. It's a neat touch that should mean you're never late again - assuming you possess the inhuman ability to actually roll out of bed on time.</p>
