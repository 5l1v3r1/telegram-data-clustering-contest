        <b>Ipswich Town boss Paul Lambert is holding his pre-match press conference ahead of the game with Blackpool.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Blues are back in League One action following a long lay-off since the 1-0 victory at Rochdale on November 5.</p>
      <p>Since then the Blues have progressed in the FA Cup, following last-gasp victory over Lincoln in the two sides' replay on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>They also lost to Colchester in the EFL Trophy.</p>
      <p>Lambert has rested many of his frontline players during that spell, but the likes of Luke Chambers, James Norwood and Cole Skuse will all return this weekend.</p>
      <p>You can watch Lambert's press conference live, right here.</p>
