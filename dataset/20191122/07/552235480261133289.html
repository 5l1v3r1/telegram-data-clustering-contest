      <h1>Steve Bruce makes John McGinn to Manchester United declaration and reveals golf trips that helped trump Celtic</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa midfielder has been rated as high as £50million and has attracted interest from Old Trafford.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:42:22+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:42</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Bird</a></address>
      <p>John McGinn has been told he’s Manchester United quality – by the boss who signed him for a bargain.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> midfielder is a £50million-rated buy and being monitored by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>But ex-Villa boss Steve Bruce has revealed how he lured <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/john-mcginn">McGinn</a> to the Midlands from Hibs in 2018 for £2m thanks to some rounds of golf at a former Ryder Cup venue.</p>
      <p>He said: “We nearly didn’t sign him because we couldn’t afford £2m. But we whipped him away from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> just at the right time. I always knew he’d be very good but he’s surpassed expectations.</p>
      <p>“How we kept him away from Celtic I don’t know because his grandfather was the chairman.</p>

      <p>“It took a couple of games of golf at The Belfry with his dad until we could muster the money together. I am delighted for the kid because he is a smashing lad.”</p>
      <p>Bruce rates him as one of his best cut-price signings. High praise indeed given he landed Liverpool’s Andy Robertson for £2.85m at Hull.</p>
      <p>Bruce said: “He has to be one of my best-ever signings because he has a determination to do well.</p>
      <p>“It took him a minute to win over the supporters at Villa when I was manager because he crashed into a tackle, sprayed a 50-yard pass and had a shot in his first few minutes.”</p>
      <p>Villa say it would take an eye- watering sum to lure him away mid-season but Bruce added: “Man United? From what he has done in 12 months, he can only improve. He is that level, yeah.”</p>
