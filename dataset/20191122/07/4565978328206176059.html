        <b>Bolivian doctors trained in Cuba and who study their specialties in Las Tunas reiterated their condemnation of the coup against President Evo Morales, while insisting on the need for the constitutional order to return to his country.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Las Tunas - From the headquarters of the Cuban Institute of Friendship with the Peoples (ICAP) in this province of eastern Cuba, the physicians expressed their concern for the fate of their relatives, friends and, in general, for their compatriots whose lives are in danger for opposing the de-facto authorities that assaulted power in the South American nation. Most of them come from the original peoples that are being repressed and discriminated against by the coup plotters, so that they underlined their disagreement with such acts that violate human rights.</p>
      <p>A total of 18 Bolivian doctors study at the Medical University of Las Tunas the specialties of Orthopedics, Surgery, Neurosurgery, Pediatrics and others, thanks to the agreements established between the Cuban government and the Movement to Socialism (MAS), overthrown on November 11 when military commanders forced the resignation of President Evo Morales.</p>
      <p>The representatives of the Ministry of Public Health, of the political and youth organizations in the territory, expressed their support and disposition so that, above all, they remain aware of their families and can continue their studies in Cuba without difficulties.</p>
