      <p>Servicing the nation’s external debt gulped $1.66bn in one year, from July 2018 to June 2019, an analysis of data obtained from the Debt Management Office has shown.</p>
      <p>Our correspondent reports that within the one-year period, the country’s external debt rose from $21.59bn to $27.16bn.</p>
      <p>This means that the external indebtedness of the country rose by $5.57bn within the one-year period. This shows an increase of 25.8 per cent.</p>
      <p>A breakdown of the debt servicing expenditure shows that the country spent $194.44m in the third quarter of 2018.</p>
      <p>In the fourth quarter of 2018, a total of $849.97m was spent on external debt servicing.</p>
      <p>In the first quarter of this year, a total of $367.26m was spent on external debt servicing while in the second quarter, a total of $252.3m was spent on it.</p>
      <p>The external debt stock as of September 2018 stood at $21.59bn. It rose to $25.27bn as of December 2018.</p>
      <p>By March 2019, it moved marginally to $25.61 and moved more significantly to $27.16 in June 2019.</p>
      <p>Both the Federal Government and state governments have been ramping on up foreign debts in recent times in a bid to cut down on domestic debt servicing.</p>
      <p>Although interests on foreign loans are considered low compared to local loans, the increase in foreign debt commitment has also resulted in increasing foreign debt commitment.</p>
      <p>DMO statistics showed that the country paid $293,003,540 for external debt services in 2012. In 2013, the payment amounted to $297,329,300.</p>
      <p>In 2014, a total of $346,723,290 was paid to service external debt.</p>
      <p>It came down slightly in 2015 when $331,059,850 was spent and moved up a bit with the payment of $353,093,540 in 2016.</p>
      <p>In 2017, the country paid $464.05m in external debt servicing while in 2018, a total of $1.47bn was paid.</p>
      <p>The rise in the domestic debt profile of the country has caused increasing concern within and outside government circles because of the high interest rate payable especially on domestic loans.</p>
      <p>The International Monetary Fund, for instance, had recently said that the government was spending more than 50 per cent of its resources on debt servicing.</p>
      <p>The African Development Bank also raised a similar concern in its 2019 Economic Outlook for West Africa.</p>
      <p>However, the Federal Government insists that the country does not have a debt problem but a revenue challenge.</p>
      <p>To tackle the challenge, it has put up a number of measures aimed at increasing the nation’s revenue profile.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Such measures include the bill to increase the Value Added Tax from five per cent to 7.5 per cent which was passed by the Senate on Thursday.</i>
