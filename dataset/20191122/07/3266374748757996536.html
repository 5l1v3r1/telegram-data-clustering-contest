      <h1>Transfer News: Manchester United dealt a blow in pursuit of Leicester City star James Maddison</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:54:34+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/author/rags8293/" target="_blank">Raghavendra Goudar</a></address>
      <h3>Manchester United have reportedly been dealt a blow in their pursuit of Leicester City’s James Maddison, as he is considering signing a new deal with the Foxes.</h3>
      <p>As per a report from the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-transfer-james-maddison-17279744?_ga=2.108798144.374705875.1574392861-1055341119.1569816716">Manchester Evening News</a>, Leicester City superstar James Maddison is considering penning a new deal with the club, handing a blow to Manchester United’s hopes of signing him.</p>
      <p>Maddison has been on Manchester United’s radar for quite some time now. Having signed for Leicester in the summer of 2018, the Englishman made a solid impression in his debut Premier League campaign and has carried on this term from where he left off last time out.</p>
      <p>So far in the 2019-20 campaign, the 22-year-old has found the back of the net on six occasions and has set up two more goals in 13 matches across all competitions, playing a key role Leicester’s ascent to the second spot in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Manchester United have struggled with a lack of creativity in the final third of the pitch this season and with someone like Maddison playing in the No. 10 role, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side would definitely stand to benefit in a great way. To that end, <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/08/27/transfer-rumour-manchester-united-to-prioritise-james-maddison-pursuit/">the Red Devils were reported to be prioritising a move for the Leicester star</a>, either in January or the next summer window.</p>

      <p>However, their hopes of signing Maddison have been dealt a major blow, as the 22-year-old, who made his England debut last week, is considering penning a new long-term contract with Leicester City. The former Norwich City midfielder is believed to be very happy at the King Power Stadium, given that the Foxes look good for a Champions League berth for next season.</p>
      <p>Maddison’s current contract with Leicester runs till the summer of 2023 and in a bid to stave off any interest from his suitors, Leicester are understood to have tabled a new contract offer for the England international. And as per the report, the 22-year-old is considering putting pen to the new deal, although he is unlikely to make a decision until the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Leicester City are currently ten points above Manchester United in the Premier League table. Should Brendan Rodgers’s men go on to qualify for the Champions League, it is highly unlikely that Maddison will want to move away from the King Power Stadium, which will come as a major blow for Solskjaer and United.</p>
      <p>Recent reports have claimed that <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/11/19/transfer-rumour-manchester-united-weighing-up-65-million-january-move-for-bruno-fernandes/">Manchester United are looking to launch a £65 million bid for Portuguese midfielder Bruno Fernandes in January</a>, which would go a long way in addressing their issues in the final third of the pitch. But, a move for Leicester’s Maddison in the immediate future seems like a distant possibility.</p>
