      <h1>BBC Question Time man thinks his £80k salary is average in bizarre rant</h1>
      <h2>The man claimed he was nowhere near the top 50% of earners in the country - despite his very healthy annual income. A clip of his rant on the BBC show quickly went viral last night.</h2>

      <p>A Question Time audience member went on a bizarre rant slamming tax increases - despite earning £80,000 a year. </p>
      <p>The man criticised Labour's plans to tax the top 5% of earners in the country - insisting his healthy annual income was "nowhere near even the top 50%" of earners in the country.</p>
      <p>He was later revealed to be an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/bbc-question-time-man-who-20935155">IT consultant</a> and champion professional motorcycle racer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> MP Richard Burgon and host Fiona Bruce went on to attempt to explain how those earning £80,000 are in fact in the top 5% of earners.</p>
      <p>According to the most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics, an income of £75,300 places an earner in the top 5 per cent.</p>
      <p>Under Labour's plan for a 45p rate on earnings over £80,000, he would pay an extra £4.81 per week if he earned £85,000 per year.</p>
      <p>However, he continues his rant, saying: "I would like to call Labour out as liars.</p>

      <p>"I am one of them people he will tax more and I am nowhere near in the top five so I am calling you a liar.</p>
      <p>"That 5% is a lie, I am nowhere near that and you are going to tax me as an employee.</p>
      <p>"You are not going after the billionaires, you are going after the employees because it's easy money and I have no choice because its PAYE."</p>
      <p>Burgon goes to say: "You are mistaken - we are not going to raise income tax apart from those in the top 5%.</p>
      <p>"And thats why were not going to increase your income tax."</p>

      <p>If the man earned £80,000 a year before tax, it would put him in the highest-earning 5% of taxpayers in the country - according to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/percentile-points-from-1-to-99-for-total-income-before-and-after-tax">official government figures</a> from 2016/17.</p>
      <p>Under Labour, the man would have to pay roughly an extra £50 for every £1,000 he earns over £80,000 per year - excluding any other changes to the system.</p>
      <p>However, the audience member continued his 'misjudged' rant - saying: "You are - I have read your policy and it's above £80,000."</p>
      <p>"I am nowhere near the top 5% - I'm not even in the top 50%."</p>

      <p>Fiona Bruce then interjected for clarification asking the man to confirm his income, to which she replies: "I think that is in the top 5%."</p>
      <p>The audience member goes on to say the "top 5% don't even work because they're rich" - calling out "doctors" and "solicitors" as those who should be taxed more.</p>
      <p>Question Time viewers took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> calling out the audience member.</p>
      <p>Josie Hall said: "God I would love to earn £80,000 a year!</p>
      <p>"My husband and I run a 2 man business, work hard and earn not a fraction of that! Yet every year we pay Corporation tax and happy and willing to pay more so we are all secure! I just don't understand."</p>
      <p>Tom Joad said: "The beauty of a manifesto that only raises taxes for those earning over £80,000 a year is that it only highlights the greed of those affected when they shout about it like this idiot did."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> vowed yesterday to raise more than £80bn a year for his programme without raising Income Tax, VAT or National Insurance on 95% of people.</p>
      <p>IFS think tank director Paul Johnson said it was "not credible" to say other earners would not be affected at all. He said: "You cannot raise that kind of money in our tax system without affecting individuals.”</p>
      <p>But Mr Corbyn said the manifesto was fully costed - and stuffed with policies "the political establishment has blocked for a generation".</p>
