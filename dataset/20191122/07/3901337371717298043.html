      </p>
      <p>Gabriel Nyoni, who joined the Team of Choice at the start of the 2019/20 season, played his part in helping his new club get into the semifinals of this year’s Telkom Knockout competition, and he’ll now be hoping to go one better and reach the final of the competition.</p>
      <p>The Zimbabwean is still waiting for his first goal in Maritzburg colours following his move from CAPS United, and would no doubt love to change that this weekend against an Amakhosi outfit that are flying high with their best season in years.</p>
      <p>Maritzburg, who are on a seven-game unbeaten run of their own, will need to be at their very best if they’re going to get a result, and Nyoni told their official website, “The international break gave us time to at least prepare for Kaizer Chiefs… We know that Chiefs have been playing very well, and the international break gave us chance to work on our belief system.</p>
      <p>“What will make us beat Kaizer Chiefs is belief and hard work, so it gave us time to work on that.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, regarding his time in South Africa so far, the attacker said that he’s very happy to be in the Absa Premiership, saying, To come here to South Africa and play for Maritzburg United means a lot, it’s a dream come true. In the first few months here we’re in the semifinals of the Telkom Knockout, which is great for me - it’s an honour for me and my family.”</p>
