      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:35:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Three men have been charged by Gardaí investigating a number of threats to kill and cause serious harm on social media.</p>
      <p>One man in his 40s and two in their 20s are due before Mullingar District Court this morning at 10:30am.</p>
      <p>It comes after a 13-year-old girl was seriously injured in an attack at her home in County Fermanagh last weekend.</p>
      <p>She suffered stab wounds after a group of men armed with machetes entered the house at Trasna Way in Lisnaskea on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>A 41-year-old woman was also injured in the attack. A baby who was also in the house was not harmed in the incident.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Gardaí said they were investigating a number of threatening videos posted on social media they believe may be connected to the Fermanagh attack.</p>
      <p>They carried out searches in the Athlone area in a bid to uncover weapons displayed in the videos and the devices used to post them online.</p>
      <p>They seized a number of weapons and electronic devices and arrested three men.</p>
      <p>They are due in court this morning.</p>
      <p>The PSNI investigation into the Fermanagh attack is ongoing.</p>
