      <p>The <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/duchess-of-sussex">Duchess of Sussex</a> has been named the most influential celebrity dresser of the year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/lyst">Lyst</a>, the global <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/fashion">fashion</a> search platform, has released its annual “<a href="https://www.lyst.com/year-in-fashion-2019/">Year in Fashion</a>” report, detailing the sartorial trends, patterns and movement that defined 2019.</p>
      <p>The report outlines which celebrities proved to be the most powerful dressers of the year, leading to surges of online searches for particular items, styles and brands.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a> has topped this year’s list, having placed third behind <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/KimKardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Kylie_Jenner">Kylie Jenner</a> in <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=44681X1458326&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lyst.co.uk%2Fyear-in-fashion-2018%2F&amp;sref=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/meghan-markle-fashion-style-powerful-celebrity-2019-timothee-chalamet-kylie-jenner-a9213196.html">2018</a>.</p>
      <p>Lyst states that on average, the duchess’ fashion choices over the past 12 months caused a 216 per cent increase in searches for similar garments.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the royal’s affinity for shirt dresses during her recent <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/meghan-markle-royal-tour-outfits-fashion-prince-harry-archie-south-africa-a9117841.html">royal tour</a> with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/PrinceHarry">Prince Harry</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/archie-harrison-mountbatten-windsor">Archie</a> to South Africa led to a 45 per cent increase in searches in that category of clothing.</p>
      <p>After Meghan met Archbishop Desmond Tutu wearing a blue and white silk Club Monaco dress, the item sold out in under 24 hours and led to a 570 per cent spike in searches.</p>
