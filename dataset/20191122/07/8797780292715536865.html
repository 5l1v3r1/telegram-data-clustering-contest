      <p>It’s not Half-Life 3. Valve’s mythical third chapter to a game about worlds being torn apart, weird men in suits watching your every move and how they totes give you the cold shoulder even when you noclip into their vicinity, is never going to be made. What <i>is </i>coming though, is Half-Life: Alyx! It may not be Half-Life 3, but Valve says that Half-Life: Alyx will still be a “full” Half-Life game that has been “designed from the ground up for virtual reality,” according to press materials.</p>
      <p>Here’s the first trailer for it:</p>

      <blockquote>The loss of the Seven-Hour War is still fresh. In the shadow of a rising Combine fortress known as the Citadel, residents of City 17 learn to live under the rule of their invaders. But among this scattered population are two of Earth’s most resourceful scientists: Dr. Eli Vance and his daughter Alyx, the founders of a fledgling resistance.<br/><br/>You and your father were relocated to City 17. In the years since, you’ve continued your clandestine scientific activity—performing critical research, and building invaluable tools for the few humans brave enough to defy the Combine.<br/>Every day you learn more about your enemy, and every day you work toward finding a weakness.</blockquote>
      <p>Valve say that they they want Half-Life: Alyx deodorant to make the most of the VR format that it’ll be presented in, which will include gameplay segments such as being able to “lean around a broken wall and under a barnacle to make an impossible shot,” and other stuff to sel ypu on the immersive game they’re looking to tempt you with:</p>

      <blockquote>Rummage through shelves to find a healing syringe and some shotgun shells. Manipulate tools to hack alien interfaces. Tear a headcrab off your face and throw it out the window. VR was built for the kind of gameplay that sits at the heart of Half-Life.</blockquote>
      <p>Half-Life: Alyx will be out in March.</p>
