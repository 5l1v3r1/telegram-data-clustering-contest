      <p>Perhaps you’re feeling cute right now. But don’t get used to it, because time, gravity and all your bad habits are already ganging up to wreak havoc on your beautiful face.</p>
      <p>Now Snapchat has designed a new lens which will reveal how you will look in the future.</p>
      <p>The lens is called Time Machine and can be used to make your face appear decades older or younger.</p>
      <p>Lenses were introduced in 2015 and are ‘augmented reality’ filters which can change your face in various ways.</p>
      <p>Notable lenses include the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/12/14/snapchat-lens-studio-new-app-lets-people-create-their-own-personal-and-diverse-lenses-7159985/">hotdog filter</a> and, erm, the dog lens – which turn you into a meaty snack or a cute pooch.</p>
      <p>In the past year, Snap has released several lenses powered by artificial intelligence and Time Machine is perhaps the most powerful yet.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Load the app and open the ‘Lenses Carousel’ by pressing the smiley button or tapping on the screen.</li>
        <li>Find the Time Machine icon and then select which direction you want the camera to shoot using the rotating arrows. Time Machine works using the front-facing and rear-facing cameras.</li>
        <li>Once you’ve centred your face in either the front-facing or rear-facing camera, tap on your screen to bring up the lens carousel.</li>
        <li>Swipe left until you reach the Time Machine lens</li>
        <li>Adjust the slider left to wind back the clock, and slide right to make yourself look older.</li>
        <li>Tap or hold the button to capture the Snap.</li>
      </ul>
