      <p>Jones came on for Steven Gerrard's side in the last quarter of the 2-0 Old Firm loss and was given his marching orders for a reckless challenge on the Stoke City loanee in the closing minutes.</p>
      <p>He was then spotted leaving Ibrox on crutches as a result of the injury.</p>
      <p>But Jones has given a positive report on his return to fitness on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Alongside some snaps at the training ground he wrote: "Long hard 12 weeks out but buzzing to be back training today🙌🏼🇬🇧❤️"</p>

      <p>The horror tackle was lambasted by boss Gerrard after the match.</p>
      <p>He said: "Listen, without a shadow of a doubt he got that one bang on.</p>
      <p>"It was a red card. I think Jordan's been trying to appease the fans there.</p>

      <p>"That's not how you appease Rangers fans. You create goals and score goals if you're a wide man.</p>
      <p>"That's how you get fans on your side - not kicking people in the boards ten yards away.</p>
      <p>"He deserves the red card, he deserves the ban and he's got everything to do now to get back into my team.</p>
      <p>"In terms of the officials I thought in the main, I'm not going to point any fingers at them.</p>
      <p>"But I thought they let a little bit too much go early on. But we're not going to look for excuses and stuff.</p>
      <p>"The reason we lost the Old Firm today was because we were not good enough across the board."</p>
