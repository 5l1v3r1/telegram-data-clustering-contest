      <h2>The FIA has played down suggestions <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/ferrari/"><b>Ferrari</b></a>'s fuel system has been "confiscated" amid suspicions of cheating.</h2>

      <p>Amid questions surrounding the legality of Ferrari's 2019 power unit, a third technical directive has now been issued by the sport's governing body.</p>
      <p>It means that from 2020, a new sensor will be added to monitor whether teams are not breaching the rules about maximum fuel flow.</p>
      <p>But it seems that the issue is not solely about Ferrari.</p>
      <p>Germany's RTL claims that along with Ferrari's, the fuel systems of a Ferrari-powered <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/haas/"><b>Haas</b></a> and a Red Bull-Honda were also seized by the FIA in Brazil.</p>
      <p>And a spokesperson for the FIA told the German broadcaster that it is not right to say the fuel system was "confiscated". Instead, it is a routine "check".</p>
