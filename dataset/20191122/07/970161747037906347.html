      <p>‘Sharing can be hard, but once you share, it feels a little more real and then once it’s more real, you can heal…</p>
      <p>‘It also made me feel not alone.’</p>

      <p>‘We are very sad to share that today we learned that our baby passed away at 4 months,’ she captioned an emotional video of herself and Carmen.</p>
      <p>‘We also want you to know that even though we are not okay right now, we will be.</p>
      <p>‘We are so lucky with our four healthy babies—and we will never lose sight of this. I told Carmen and took this so I could send it to Alec.</p>
      <p>‘I guess this is a good way to share it with you too. I told her that this baby isn’t going to come after all…but we will try very hard to give her a little sister another time.</p>

      <p>‘I’m really devastated right now…I was not expecting this when I went to my scan today. I don’t know what else to say.</p>
      <p>‘I’m still in shock and don’t have this all quite clear. Please no paparazzi…that’s all I ask.’</p>
