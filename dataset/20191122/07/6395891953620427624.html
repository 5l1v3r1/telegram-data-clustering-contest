      <p><b>XENIA, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - A man accused of the stabbing death of a man whose body was found in a nature preserve in Ohio has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and felonious assault.</p>
      <p>Twenty-six-year-old Zyrian Atha-Arnett pleaded not guilty Thursday in a Greene County court. Atha-Arnett, of Enon, is charged in the death of 26-year-old Leonid Clark, who went missing in January. The Yellow Springs man's body was found April 12 along the Little Miami River in the Glen Helen Nature Preserve in western Ohio.</p>
      <p>Greene County sheriff's detectives say Atha-Arnett stabbed Clark multiple times. A message seeking comment was left for Atha-Arnett's attorney.</p>
      <p>Investigators haven't commented on a potential motive. They say phone records show the men exchanged several text messages and calls prior to the slaying.</p>
