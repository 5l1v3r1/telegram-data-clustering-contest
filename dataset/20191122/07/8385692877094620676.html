      <p>Amazon has the iRobot Roomba e5 robot vacuum <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">on sale</a> right now for just $279. Good for $100 off of its regular price. And it is also $20 cheaper than it will be on Black Friday. So that makes this the perfect time to pick one up, instead of waiting until Black Friday, next week.</p>
      <p>The iRobot Roomba e5 is a pretty good robot vacuum from the company. It's an inexpensive model, but not a bad one. It still has plenty of suction to get up all of the dirt and dust from your home.</p>
      <p>It has five times the suction power of most other robot vacuums. And that makes this perfect for those with pets. As it's going to be able to get up all of that pet hair with ease.</p>

      <p>The e5 still sports iRobot's popular three-stage cleaning system. This system is able to clean up the dirt and dust you see and the allergens that you don't see. In fact, you might be surprised at how much dirt it picks up that you don't see.</p>
      <p>The iRobot Roomba e5 works with the iRobot app. This allows you to set up a schedule and see its map of your home. This is going to also show you where it has already cleaned. The app works for navigating the Roomba to a specific spot to start cleaning as well.</p>
      <p>Of course, we can't forget the fact that the iRobot Roomba e5 works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. This is going to allow you to use your voice to control your Roomba, and tell it to clean up your home, without having to open the app or even have your phone nearby. That's a really good feature, especially for those that are big on the smart home.</p>
