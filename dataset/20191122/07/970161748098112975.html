      <p>French Montana has reportedly been rushed to hospital after suffering ‘cardiac issues’ at his home in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>The rapper, 35, had been visited by police after they were called out to a possible robbery at his home in Calabasas, and the officers had to call him an ambulance while they were there.</p>
      <p>TMZ reports that French Montana – real name Karim Kharbouch – was suffering ‘scary cardiac issues and intense nausea’.</p>
      <p>When officers arrived at his house at around 1.30pm on Thursday, they discovered the robbery was a false alarm but noticed French acting out of character.</p>
      <p>They said he ‘seemed out of it’ and was suffering severe stomach pains, nausea and an elevated heart rate, which needed checking out in hospital.</p>
      <p>French was taken to a nearby hospital and TMZ reports that he is ‘awake and alert’ and receiving treatment including IV fluids, and is expected to be released today.</p>

      <p>The cause of his issues is suspected to be contaminated food, after sources close to the rapper revealed he has been travelling around Europe and the Middle East in the past few weeks.</p>

      <p>French, who previously dated Khloe Kardashian in 2013 and 2014, had been back in his native Morocco visiting family and had recently returned to his home in LA.</p>
      <p>He was born and raised in Morocco and made the trip back there to celebrate his birthday with his mum and dad.</p>
      <p>Despite the couple not working out, he recently told Haute Living: ‘We are always going to be friends, and the family still remains close.</p>
      <p>‘I feel like we had a real dope relationship. There was no bad blood, nobody did something to somebody that we couldn’t come back from. The love was real.’</p>
      <p>French is also set to release his third studio album, Montana, this month which will feature collaborations with Post Malone, Cardi B and others.</p>
