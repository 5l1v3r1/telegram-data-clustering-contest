      <p>A manhunt is underway after a bus driver was attacked by a passenger following an argument.</p>
      <p>The attacker flew into a rage and ripped off a piece of perspex from the driver’s booth.</p>
      <p>He then made a stabbing motion with it, before throwing it at the booth and continued to hurl abuse.</p>
      <p>He then left the bus and picked up a bike that used it as a battering ram on the number 48 bus in Bishopsgate, City of London.</p>

      <p>PC Sam Lowe said: ‘This was a terrifying and violent incident which happened in the middle of the day, with many witnesses around.</p>
      <p>‘Thankfully, the bus driver was physically unhurt, but it was obviously traumatic for someone to be subjected to this level of abuse and violence while at work.</p>
      <p>‘We would encourage anyone who saw this incident, or who has information about the identity of this dangerous individual, to get in touch with us.’</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is being urged to contact City of London Police.</p>
