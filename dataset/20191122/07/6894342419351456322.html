      <h1>Samsung’s FCC Filing Confirms Rumoured Galaxy S10 Lite</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:00:58+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/bryanlim/" target="_blank">Bryan Lim</a></address>
      <p>A few months ago, it was rumoured that Samsung is planning to make another toned-down “lite” version of Galaxy S10. Recently, Samsung has filed a device with a model number of “SM-G770F” for certifications under the US’ Federal Communications Commission (FCC).</p>
      <p>SamMobile has previously referred to the “SM-G770F” model as the Galaxy S10 Lite. Hence, the appearance of the exact model number in the FCC filings has confirmed the existence of the smartphone. That said, it doesn’t necessarily confirm the name.</p>
      <p>Currently, the exact specifications or designs of the Galaxy S10 Lite are still not known. However, XDA mentioned that the smartphone is rumoured to sport a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 SoC with 8GB RAM and 128GB of storage.</p>

      <p>Additionally, it’s also mentioned that it comes with a triple camera set up, which includes 48MP, 12MP and 5MP sensors. There is also a 32MP front camera, a 4500 mAh battery with 45W charging and a 6.7-inch Full HD+ display.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, it does feel rather odd for Samsung to release a Lite version of the Galaxy S10, given that Samsung has already released the Galaxy S10e prior to this. Also, there is also a <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/195066/samsung-could-be-working-on-a-lite-version-of-the-galaxy-note10/">rumour</a> that Samsung is making a Lite version of the Galaxy Note 10. As for now, we will have to wait for Samsung to make the official reveal.</p>
