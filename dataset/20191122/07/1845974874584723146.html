      <h4>England recently celebrated their 1000th game with a 7-0 thumping against Montenegro. What are some of Chelsea’s big 1000 moments from history?</h4>
      <p>England’s 1000th game was a great victory and a somewhat minor celebration. It is rare for any team or player to hit a milestone that matches up with that first four digit number, but Chelsea has several of their own. What was the 1000th Premier League game for Chelsea? The 1000th Premier League goal? The Blues do in fact have a few of these moments in history.</p>
      <h3>Chelsea players in England’s 1000th game</h3>
      <p>Okay, this is a bit of a cop out. It has been rare to have so many Chelsea players in the English national team in recent years so when <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/england-vs-montenegro/403402"><b>two showed up in the 1000th match</b></a>, it was noteworthy.</p>
      <p>Mason Mount started the match and Tammy Abraham came on late as a substitute. Neither player could particularly be called an English starter (yet) but both have very much laid down a marker at Chelsea this season.</p>
      <p>Along with Fikayo Tomori, Reece James, and Callum Hudson-Odoi, those two are leading the charge for a generation of academy players finding their way into the Chelsea first team and consequentially the English national team.</p>
      <p>They were involved in England’s big achievement, but that is really just the start. These players could potentially go on to be huge parts of club and country for the next decade. As such, they have plenty of time to start breaking their own 1000 records as individuals and cumulatively. It is a new era at Chelsea where everything seems possible.</p>
