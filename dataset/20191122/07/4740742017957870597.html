      <h2>Warning: Evidence can include graphic details that some readers may find upsetting</h2>

      <p>A music star accused of raping, abusing, assaulting and imprisoning four different women told one of them he’d raped her, a court in Bristol has heard.</p>
      <p>Andy Anokye, who faces 31 different charges, filmed much of the alleged abuse and even filmed a conversation in which he admitted he’d raped a woman, a jury was told.</p>
      <p>The music artist, better known as Solo 45, was arrested after he moved to Bristol and attacked a woman here, the jury heard.</p>
      <p>Anokye is charged with 22 counts of rape, five counts of false imprisonment, two counts of assault by penetration and two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old denies all the charges, which relate to a period in 2015, 2016 and 2017, and a trial at Bristol Crown Court began on Thursday, November 21.</p>
      <p>On <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/solo-45-rape-trial-court-3562300">the first morning of the trial</a>, prosecution counsel Christopher Quinlan described Anokye as a ‘violent and controlling narcissist and a bully’.</p>
      <p>“He is a sadist who derives satisfaction and sexual pleasure from inflicting pain and suffering on his victims,” said Mr Quinlan, in his opening statement to a jury of seven women and five men.</p>
      <p>“He physically assaulted and falsely imprisoned them, held them against their will and he raped each of them repeatedly,” he added.</p>
      <p>Mr Quinlan told the jury that the case rests on the question of consent - that the prosecution will show that the women did not consent to what happened to them, and that Anokye did not have reason to believe they did.</p>

      <p>Mr Quinlan told the jury that rape was all about consent, and it did not matter that the women knew Anokye.</p>
      <p>He told the jury Anokye’s defence was that the women did consent, and that everything the jury would be shown was part of consensual ‘rough sex’ games and role play.</p>
      <p>In the afternoon session, Mr Quinlan began the task of going through each of the 31 charges, and summarising them, warning the jury to expect to see graphic video footage of Anokye allegedly raping and abusing four different women.</p>
      <p>Mr Quinlan described one video clip as a conversation between Anokye and the second of the four complainants, which took place in a car.</p>
      <p>“Anokye says: ‘My sex is on the verge of rape. I f*** you when you don’t want to be f***ed. That is technically rape’,” Mr Quinlan said.</p>
      <p>The woman, Mr Quinlan said, replied: “I don’t like it.”</p>
      <p>Mr Quinlan told the jury that Mr Anokye replied in the video clip: “Which means I’ve raped you three or four times... Forced... when you didn’t want it.”</p>
      <p>Mr Quinlan then paraphrased the conversation. “He asked her if that was a problem. She replied I don’t know.</p>
      <p>“‘Are you aware I’ve raped you?’ Anokye asked her and the woman replied: ‘I don’t think it’s that is it? It would be rape if it was a stranger’,” Mr Quinlan added.</p>
      <p>“He (Anokye) told her it makes no difference if it’s with someone she knows,” the prosecutor added.</p>
      <p>“This goes back to what I said at the start of the opening statement,” Mr Quinlan told the jury. “The part about rape not having to be with a stranger.</p>
      <p>“In summary she was confused at the time,” he told the jury.</p>
      <p>“She did what he told her to do. ‘Whatever he told me to do that’s what I’d do, whether I wanted to or not’ was what she told the police later.</p>
      <p>“You’re here to assess what amounts to rape, and you’re satisfied if it has been proved in the case of this defendant,” said Mr Quinlan.</p>
      <p>“He had, as he put it, raped her before.”</p>
      <p>Mr Quinlan summarised other charges against Anokye by describing video clips featuring two different women at different times, both of whom Anokye filmed while allegedly raping them, both who are filmed crying.</p>
      <p>“You will need to watch the video of this, and you will look at the faces of the two people involved, they are both facing the camera,” Mr Quinlan told the jury.</p>
      <p>“She is crying, and crying out in pain. He is laughing, and is triumphant,” he added.</p>
      <p>The first day of the trial ended with Mr Quinlan having summarised the first 20 of the 31 charges.</p>
      <p>Anokye, of Millennium Promenade in Bristol, denies all 31 charges.</p>
      <p>The case continues.</p>
