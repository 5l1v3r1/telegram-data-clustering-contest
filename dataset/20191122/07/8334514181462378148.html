      <p>SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha will visit Japan on Friday for a meeting of the Group of 20 big economies, a diplomatic source said, as the neighbors’ pact to share intelligence is set to end over a diplomatic and trade dispute.</p>
      <p>Saturday is the pact’s deadline, and Kang is traveling regardless of a final decision by South Korea, which is still being discussed, the source said on condition of anonymity, because of the sensitivity of the discussions.</p>
      <p>South Korea’s move to let its GSOMIA pact with Tokyo lapse defies mounting U.S. pressure to maintain a key element of security cooperation among the three.</p>
