      <h1>Transfer News: Manchester United and Arsenal target Dejan Kulusevski not thinking about transfer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:58:44+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/author/rags8293/" target="_blank">Raghavendra Goudar</a></address>
      <h3>On-loan Parma midfielder Dejan Kulusevski, who is being scouted by Arsenal and Manchester United, has insisted he is not thinking about a transfer at the moment.</h3>
      <p>As reported by the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/man-utd-arsenal-target-dejan-kulusevski-speaks-transfer-speculation-11189884/">Metro</a>, Arsenal and Manchester United transfer target Dejan Kulusevski, who plies his trade for Serie A outfit Parma, has claimed that he is focusing on the current season and not mulling over his future ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old Kulusevski started out in his homeland Sweden with IF Bromma, before making the switch to the youth setup of Italian outfit Atalanta back in 2016. The midfielder joined Parma on a season-long loan this past summer and has made a great impression in his first ever Serie A campaign.</p>
      <p>Kulusevski has contributed with 2 goals and 5 assists from 12 league games, helping his temporary club to eighth place in the table. And naturally, his performances have caught the eyes of other clubs, most notably Premier League heavyweights Arsenal and Manchester United. Fellow Premier League outfits Southampton and Wolves are also interested.</p>
      <p>Arsenal, as per the report, first noticed the 19-year-old two years ago, during his time at Atalanta and have continued to keep tabs on his progress. The teenage midfielder caught the eyes of the Manchester United scouts earlier this season, when they were watching Chris Smalling as Parma went on to defeat AS Roma 2-0.</p>

      <p>And responding to the transfer speculations linking him with two of the biggest clubs in Europe, Kulusevski said, “I’m fine at Parma, I’m happy to be here, I’ve found the perfect club. The market? I’m playing well, so it’s normal to write about other clubs, but I don’t think about (a January move) because I have an annual deal with Parma.”</p>
      <p>Both Arsenal and Manchester United have had difficult starts to the season. The Gunners have lacked a creative presence on the field owing to manager <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/opinion/unai-emery-not-the-right-man-to-take-arsenal-forward">Unai Emery’s insistence on not using Mesut Ozil regularly</a>, while Manchester United have also faced the same problem, more so with Paul Pogba spending so much time out on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>And Kulusevski, who can play anywhere in the final third, be it as a No. 10 or on either flanks, or even as a forward, could be a viable solution, especially for Manchester United, who lack depth on the right flank and the centre-forward department.</p>
      <p>Kulusevski has made a strong start to the campaign, that earned him his first international cap with Sweden during the most recent international break. However, a move to either Manchester United or Arsenal in the January transfer window seems a highly unlikely prospect at the moment. For now, he is set to continue his development with Parma.</p>
