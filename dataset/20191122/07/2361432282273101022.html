      <h1>Republican National Committee Spent $94,800 for Copies of Donald Trump Jr's Book 'Triggered'</h1>
      <h2>The book has topped the New York Times best-seller list for two weeks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:58:45+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/j-clara-chan/" target="_blank">J. Clara Chan</a></address>
      <p>The Republican National Committee spent $94,800 on copies of Donald Trump Jr.’s book, “Triggered,” according to <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/307/201911209165951307/201911209165951307.pdf">new filings with the Federal Elections Commission</a>.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 29, a week before the release of Trump Jr.’s book, the RNC paid that amount to the bookseller website Books A Million. The expenditure was listed as being for “donor mementos,” according to the FEC filing. Representatives for the RNC did not respond to a request for comment from The Wrap, but a spokesperson <a href="https://twitter.com/nickconfessore/status/1197599033503756288">confirmed to the New York Times’ Nick Confessore</a> that the $94,800 was spent to promote Trump Jr.’s book.</p>

      <p>Since its publication, “Triggered” has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/hardcover-nonfiction/">topped the New York Times’ nonfiction best-seller list</a> for two weeks. The caveat, however, is that a significant portion of the book’s sales were driven by “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/methodology/">institutional, special interest, group or bulk purchases</a>.”</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, on the day of the book’s release, the <a href="https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/1191850257161826304">RNC launched a fundraising campaign</a> to give out signed copies of Trump Jr.’s book to anyone who donated $50 or more to the committee.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/14/donald-trump-jr-may-have-bulk-purchased-his-own-book-to-juice-sales/">statement to Page Six last week</a>, an RNC spokesperson denied that it made “a large bulk purchase” and was instead “ordering copies to keep up with demand.” The RNC also announced on Tuesday that it had <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/19/exclusive-rnc-raises-more-than-half-million-dollars-off-donald-trump-jr-triggered-book/">raised more than $500,000</a> from the campaign.</p>
      <p>As of Thursday, “Triggered” is on sale via Books A Million for $23.09. At that price, the RNC would’ve been able to purchase about 4,105 copies of Trump Jr.’s book. To get on the NYT best-seller list, a book <a href="https://scribewriting.com/get-best-seller-list/">must sell at least 5,000 copies in a week</a>, according to the book marketing and consulting company Scribe.</p>
