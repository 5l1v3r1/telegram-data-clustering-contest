      <p>A FOUR-STOREY apartment building in Innaloo has been approved despite opposition from the City of Stirling and councillors.</p>
      <p>The Metro North-West Development Assessment Panel at its November 7 meeting reconsidered company Precious Iron’s application for a 28-unit development fronting Geneff Street and Hertha Road, <a href="https://www.communitynews.com.au/stirling-times/news/height-and-parking-issues-see-innaloo-apartments-knocked-back/">after it was previously refused in May</a> and they appealed to the State Administrative Tribunal.</p>
      <p>In a report to the panel, the City reiterated its objection to the proposal despite one storey being removed and a slight reduction in the number and extent of variations to the planning framework.</p>
      <p>It said it was inconsistent with the expectation of what the local development plan would deliver for the area, which was developed with a high level of community consultation.</p>
      <p>“While a storey of the development has been removed, the proposed wall height, bulk, scale, and impacts in terms of visual privacy and overshadowing remain<br/>excessive,” it said.</p>
      <p>Panel members and Stirling councillors Elizabeth Re and David Boothman agreed but were outvoted by the three Department of Planning members, who found with conditions the development was “generally in accordance with the intent” of the local development plan and the variations were reasonable.</p>
      <p>The complex will be four storeys on Hertha Road and three storeys on Geneff Street, with a partially sunken basement carpark comprising 41 car and two motorbike parking bays.</p>
