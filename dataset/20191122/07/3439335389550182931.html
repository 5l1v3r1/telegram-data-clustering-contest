      <p>Authorities arrested a second woman for aiding a 48-year-old fugitive on Kauai.</p>
      <p>U.S. Marshals and Honolulu police arrested Leona Boggs-Kaui, 41, of Kauai at the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport Wednesday night on a federal warrant for harboring and concealing <a href="https://808ne.ws/335SWGM">Orlando </a><a href="https://808ne.ws/335SWGM">Manguchei</a>, who law enforcement nabbed Monday following a 7-day manhunt.</p>
      <p>Authorities located Boggs-Kaui at the airport as she was trying to board a flight, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. She is scheduled to appear in federal court Friday.</p>
      <p>Boggs-Kaui has a criminal history that includes arrests and convictions for narcotics, theft of a firearm, criminal contempt of court and violating terms of parole and probation.</p>
      <p>Law enforcement arrested another woman, Alicia Kilpatrick, 35, at a residence in Kalaheo Tuesday on a federal arrest warrant for aiding Manguchei.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Manguchei was convicted in federal court on three counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm and/or ammunition. He was sentenced to a 46-month prison term and three years of supervised release, according to a U.S. Marshals Service news release.</p>
      <p>After Manguchei completed his prison term in September, authorities issued a federal warrant against him for violating terms of his supervised release.</p>
      <p>Law enforcement located him in the wooded area above Wailua Monday after a 7-day manhunt.</p>
