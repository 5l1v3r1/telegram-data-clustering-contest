        <b>The Panesar clan arrived in EastEnders several weeks back, and — upon their arrival — they were <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/29/eastenders-star-gurlaine-kaur-garcha-promises-more-huge-shocks-after-major-ash-panesar-twist-11006837/">determined to track down their sister, Ash</a> (Guraline Kaur Garcha). However, Jags (Amar Adatia) soon found himself distracted from his mission when he set his sights upon Chantelle (Jessica Plummer) in a scene which <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/29/eastenders-spoilers-jags-panesar-to-save-chantelle-atkins-from-domestic-abuser-gray-11004763/">implied that he recognised the young woman</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A conversation with Kheerat (Jaz Deol) later clarified matters for the viewers, as it was revealed that Jags had previously went to school with Chantelle — and that he’d once went out on a date with her.</p>
      <p>In the coming episodes, Jags decides it’s time that he speak to Chantelle, and thus he approaches her and strikes up a conversation.</p>

      <p>It doesn’t take long for Chantelle to remember who he is, and they begin to fondly reminisce about old times.</p>
      <p>Later in the week, Chantelle bumps into Jags once more — only this time he’s with Kheerat, and she’s with Gray (Toby-Alexander Smith). Of course, Gray wastes little time in making his presence known.</p>

      <p>With Gray having demonstrated how controlling he is in the past; he’ll no doubt feel threatened by having one of Chantelle’s exes living on the Square.</p>
      <p>As a result, could he set about doing something about it?</p>
      <p>Is Jags <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/01/eastenders-spoilers-violent-gray-atkins-to-commit-murder-as-jags-panesar-discovers-his-abuse-of-chantelle-11019853/">in danger from the solicitor</a>?</p>
      <p>If his past behaviour is anything to go by, then it’s certainly a possibility.</p>
      <p>Mind you, the Panesar clan have proven that you don’t want to mess with them, so perhaps Gray could’ve met his match?</p>
