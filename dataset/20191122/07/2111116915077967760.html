      <h3>Samsung Galaxy A71 leaks point to an Infinity-O display and quad-cameras</h3>

      <p>The next wave of Samsung mid-rangers is upon us, which started with <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/news/samsung-galaxy-a51-to-sport-a-48mp-quad-camera-setup">the Galaxy A51</a>, and now it’s the Galaxy A71, which has been fully leaked and rendered.</p>
      <p>Samsung brought a new naming scheme to its A series of mid-rangers, earlier this year. Their minor updates added an “s” suffix, and the bigger updates add a unit to the final name. The Samsung Galaxy A71 succeeds <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/reviews/samsung-galaxy-a70-india">the A70 and the A70s</a>, bringing a new design to the front and adding a camera to the rear.</p>

      <p>These renders were shared by @<a href="https://cashkaro.com/blog/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-a71-images/114933">OnLeaks</a>, the reputed leakster, and give us a good idea about what to expect from the Samsung Galaxy A71. The most noticeable change comes with the display, as it sports a center-placed punch-hole Infinity-O display, making it one of the first devices <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-10-review-and-specs">after the Note10</a> to do so. Its predecessors had a conventional Infinity-U waterdrop notch.</p>

      <p>This allows the display to attain a higher screen-to-body ratio. Coming in at 6.7-inches, the Galaxy A71 is one of the biggest displays on a non-flagship Samsung device. An optical in-display fingerprint scanner is also likely to be present here.</p>
      <p>The other significant change comes with the cameras. The A70s <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/news/samsung-galaxy-a70s-rumored-to-include-worlds-first-64mp-phone-camera">brought a 64MP camera</a> to Samsung’s mid-rangers, and the Galaxy A71 will add one more camera to the mix, bringing the total up to four. It will follow a design similar to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/reviews/samsung-galaxy-m30s">the M30s</a> with a big camera island, with the sensors arranged in an L-formation. The renders also suggest a camera bump.</p>

      <p>The bottom has a loudspeaker grille, a USB Type-C port, and a headphone jack, while all the buttons are on the right side. Internal specifications powering the Samsung Galaxy A71 have not been detailed, but it should at least <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/news/samsung-galaxy-a70s-rumored-to-include-worlds-first-64mp-phone-camera">match the A70s</a>, if not improve upon them.</p>
      <p>For reference, the Galaxy A70s was powered by the Snapdragon 675 chipset with 6GB of RAM, housed a big 4,500mAh battery with support for 25W fast charging, and was one of the first Samsung smartphones with a 64MP primary camera, followed by an ultrawide and a depth sensor.</p>
