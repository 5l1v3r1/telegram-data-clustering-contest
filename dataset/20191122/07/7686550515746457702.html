      <h1>The rugby morning headlines as Joe Marler's bizarre interview goes global and Welsh region battle to keep star man</h1>
      <h2>The latest rugby news from around Wales and the world</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:18:01+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:18</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Doel</a></address>
      <p>Here are your latest rugby headlines on the morning of Friday, November 22.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Joe Marler goes global</b>
      </p>
      <p>England prop Joe Marler has become something of a global star after his brilliantly bizarre interview went viral.</p>
      <p>Marler's antics during the hilarious interview with Harlequins' in-house media team, which included him imitating a horse, have proved a huge hit on social media.</p>
      <p>And the story has even reached Australia, New Zealand and America, with NBC and the Washington Post reporting on the video. The Post's headline reads: "A rugby player talks about horses in hilarious interview. We don't know what it means, either."</p>
      <p>Marler's interview starts off in seemingly normal fashion, initially using the old sporting cliche of "getting back on the horse" after a heavy defeat against Clermont last weekend.</p>
      <p>But things soon take a bit of a strange turn...</p>

        <b>The battle for Tipuric</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Ospreys know they have a battle on their hands to keep Justin Tipuric.</p>
      <p>The Wales star is out of contract this summer and is a wanted man.</p>
      <p>Media reports have suggested the Wales openside has received a £500,000-a-year offer from Bristol Bears, though his representatives deny any such approach.</p>
      <p>Top 14 clubs Clermont Auvergne, Toulouse, Lyon and Toulon have also been linked. Tipuric can choose to play wherever he wants and is not captured by Wales' 60-cap rule.</p>
      <p>“It is no secret that I am a tremendous admirer,” said Ospreys coach Allen Clarke of the 30-year-old, who has won 72 Wales caps.</p>
      <p>“He’s as good a rugby player as I have ever been involved with.</p>
      <p>“He is a brilliant person and iconic, up there with Alun Wyn Jones in terms of what the Ospreys are about.</p>
      <p>“For us and for me as head coach it’s important we retain players like Justin Tipuric because it shows our level of ambition.</p>
      <p>“What we need to do is put a squad together that realises his ambitions.</p>
      <p>“He is interested in being at a club that can win trophies and that’s where we want to be in the near future.”</p>

        <b>Welsh regions in European action</b>
      </p>
      <p>The four Welsh regions are back in European action this weekend, with the Dragons and Scarlets playing tonight.</p>
      <p>New Wales squad member Taine Basham starts for the Dragons in Russia as they play Enisei-STM in the Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p>The Scarlets have Aaron Shingler back in their team as they face a daunting trip to Toulon in the same competition. More team news <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/wales-international-plays-first-game-17292670">can be found here.</a></p>

        <b>The game that finished 0-0</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's a score you almost never see in rugby, but two Midlands-based teams managed to pull it off.</p>
      <p>Pinley and Sutton Coldfield played out a 0-0 draw, with those who were there left scratching their heads as to how on earth it happened.</p>
      <p>There were six missed penalties, one from right in front of the sticks, a knock-on five metres from the line and a sin-binning.</p>
      <p>Pinley president Gary Marks was still struggling to explain it when he spoke to BBC Coventry &amp; Warwickshire's weekly Rugby Show</p>
      <p>He said: "The game had everything except points. We had a yellow card, all those missed penalties and one hit the post.</p>
      <p>"The conditions weren't actually that bad. It was cold but the rain held off and our pitch held up well. It was just that the two defences won the day.</p>
      <p>"The people on social media saying it was dull obviously weren't there.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't a bad game at all. But, if they'd played on for another 30 minutes, nobody would have scored. It was that kind of day."</p>

        <b>Tongan team placed in quarantine</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Tongan women's rugby team have been placed in quarantine following a measles outbreak.</p>
      <p>Tonga were hoping to compete at the Oceania Championship in Fiji - a route to qualify for 2021 World Cup - but are now out of the tournament.</p>
      <p>They were scheduled to play Australia A on Monday and Samoa on Friday.</p>
      <p>A Fiji health ministry official said Tonga's participation could have spread the disease internationally.</p>
      <p>"There's a risk that the teams they play against and any other people they come into contact with during the infectious period of the disease could be exposed and develop the disease," said Dr Aalisha Sahukan.</p>
      <p>"And those who potentially develop the disease could spread it to other people in Fiji, and overseas when the national teams return home."</p>
      <p>Tonga's health ministry last week reported 251 confirmed or suspected cases in the country but there have been new cases reported across the region affecting Samoa, Tonga, Australia, New Zealand and now Fiji.</p>
