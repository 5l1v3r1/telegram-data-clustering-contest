      <h1>Ray Dalio says global economy heading for 'great sag'</h1>
      <h2>Hedge fund founder concerned about wealth gap</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:36:52+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:36</time> by <a rel="author">Jill Disis, CNN Business</a></address>
      <p>BEIJING - Ray Dalio doesn't want to use the word <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/05/economy/mary-daly-fed-recession-boss-files/index.html">"recession"</a> when talking about the <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/15/economy/imf-world-economic-outlook/index.html">global economy</a>. Buthe does believe it is headed for what he dubbed the "Great Sag."</p>
      <p>The billionaire hedge fund founder told CNN Business on Thursday that the world is dealing withfinancial challenges on a scale not seen since the 1930s, when economies were deep in the throes of the Great Depression.</p>
      <p><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/21/investing/pensions-crisis-negative-rates/index.html">Pension</a> and health care debts are piling up faster than they can be funded, he said. And with <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/20/economy/china-economy-rate-cut-pboc/index.html">interest rates</a> as low as they are around the world, Dalio said he doubts that further action from <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/24/economy/ecb-mario-draghi-christine-lagarde/index.html">central banks</a> will do much to help.</p>
      <p>"The impetuses for growth that began in 2008 and 2009 are largely behind us," Dalio said on the sidelines of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Beijing.</p>
      <p>That lack ofpolicy effectiveness creates other problems, Dalio added. By buying up government debt and encouraging more lending, central banks are just putting more money in the hands of investors â€” exacerbating <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/14/business/elizabeth-warren-billionaire-wealth-tax/index.html">the divide between the rich and poor</a>.</p>
      <p>"The world is awash in liquidity," Dalio said. "But it doesn't resolve the wealth gap."</p>
      <p>That kind of inequality has fueled unrest in places like <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/15/economy/hong-kong-economy-recession-protests/index.html">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/04/opinions/chiles-elites-arent-listening-to-the-protestors-garratt/index.html">Chile</a>, Dalio said, adding that tension in those areas "is a reflection of that increased populism."</p>
      <p>Dalio is famous for predicting the 2008 financial crisis. And he worries now that capitalism is broken for most people. In a recent LinkedIn post, he wrote that the world is "approaching a big paradigm shift."</p>
      <p>On Thursday, he suggested that he's bracing himself for turbulent times by diversifying the assets of his fund, Bridgewater Associates. But when it comes to solving the "sag," he's not optimistic.</p>
      <p>The only way to respond is to rise above it, he added, "and say what is good for the whole."</p>
