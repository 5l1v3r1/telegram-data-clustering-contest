      <p>THREE MEN ARE due to appear in court this morning in relation to an ongoing investigation into social media threats to kill and cause serious harm to people.</p>
      <p>The men, one aged in his 40s and two in their 20s, were arrested in Athlone yesterday morning.</p>
      <p>They were questioned by gardaí and later charged.</p>
      <p>The three men are due to appear before Mullingar District Court at 10.30am. Investigations are ongoing.</p>
      <p>It’s believed the arrests are connected to <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/fermanagh-serious-assault-4894919-Nov2019/">last weekend’s machete attack</a> carried out at a house in Co Fermanagh. </p>
      <p>A 13-year-old girl sustained serious stab wounds in the attack and was taken to hospital. A 41-year-old woman was also treated for stab wounds.</p>
      <p>A baby was present at the scene but was unharmed in the incident. On Monday, a relative said the girl was protecting her 11-month-old nephew when the attack happened. </p>
