      <p>Having discovered that cheating love rat Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill) has been living a double life with his pregnant fiancee Vicky Jeffries (Kerri Quinn), his other bride-to-be Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) has been biding her time and is prepared to take him for everything she has got in order to have the ultimate revenge.</p>
      <p>With both Michelle and Robert set to exit Coronation Street in dramatic fashion at the end of the year, the stakes have never been higher and fans are keen to see Robert pay the price for his betrayals. It was always bound to come back and bite him but right now, he is oblivious to the fact that Michelle is plotting payback – and that’s how she wants it to stay for now.</p>
      <p>As Ray tells Michelle that he is dropping his case against her, he follows it up with a dangerous threat – she had better watch her back. With this on her mind, Adam Barlow (Sam Robertson) advises her to ditch her plan to take the bistro from Robert but she isn’t prepared to let Robert get away with what he has done.</p>

      <p>When Robert lets slip that Vicky knows about her ordeal with losing Ruari, Michelle is disgusted and furious and this only serves to convince her further that she wants Robert to suffer. As Robert suggests to Michelle that they gather their loved ones together to talk about the upcoming wedding, Michelle paints on a false smile and agrees.</p>
      <p>With Robert having bought her a necklace, Michelle tells Carla (Alison King) that if he thinks he can buy her affections, he can think again. With her revenge very much still on the agenda, she plans to take him for every penny.</p>

      <p>Recently, the stars filmed wedding scenes and this seems to be a likely venue for Robert to be exposed.</p>
      <p>But with rumours that things will get even darker and Robert will be killed in a Christmas siege, is he about to pay an even bigger price than Michelle planned?</p>
