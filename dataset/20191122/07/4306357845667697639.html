      <h1>Pundit tells Jose Mourinho to make ‘dream’ Tottenham signing</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham Hotspur boss Jose Mourinho should consider a swoop to sign Zlatan Ibrahimovic, according to Danny Mills</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thesportreview.com/topics/football-transfers/" target="_blank">Transfer Agent</a></address>
      <h3>Jose Mourinho should look to bring Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Tottenham Hotspur, according to pundit Danny Mills.</h3>
      <p>Tottenham appointed Mourinho as their new manager on Wednesday morning less than 12 hours after Mauricio Pochettino’s dismissal.</p>
      <p>Mourinho’s arrival heralds a new era at the north London side after Pochettino had steered Spurs to a their first-ever Champions League final last term.</p>
      <p>The former Real Madrid manager has inherited a Tottenham side in 14th position in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic became a free agent earlier this month after the former FC Barcelona striker ended his spell at Major League Soccer outfit LA Galaxy.</p>
      <p>The Swedish striker has been linked with a return to the Premier League amid reports Manchester United could re-sign the prolific goal-scorer.</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic has worked with Mourinho at Manchester United and Inter Milan.</p>
      <p>However, former Manchester City defender Mills believes Mourinho should consider a swoop to sign the 38-year-old striker.</p>
      <p>“How about Zlatan to Tottenham? Who’s the backup striker to Harry Kane? They haven’t got one,” Mills told <i>Football Insider</i>, as quoted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/zlatan-ibrahimovic-dream-signing-jose-mourinhos-tottenham-says-danny-mills-11191081/">Metro</a>.</p>
      <p>“He’s unattached, he’s left the MLS, he’s a free agent and as ludicrous as it sounds, think of the experience that he’s got and everybody talks about when he went to Manchester United, what he added to the dressing room, the work ethic that he’s got.</p>
      <p>“I’m not saying he’s going to go in and replace Harry Kane, but he would be one hell of an option as almost a player-coach role type scenario.</p>
      <p>“He’s obviously revered all over the world, I think he’s got enough confidence to pull it off.</p>
      <p>“From Tottenham’s point of view he’s a marketing dream, he’s going to sell a lot of shirts very, very quickly, he loves Mourinho to bits.</p>
      <p>“You just start to think, is it a possibility to bring a player like that in to give them a bit of a boost?”</p>
      <p>Tottenham are in 14th position in the Premier League table and 11 points behind fourth-placed Manchester City in the race to secure a Champions League spot.</p>
      <p>Spurs have only managed to win one of their last six Premier League games, losing twice and drawing three times.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has a proven record in the Premier League after winning three titles as well as FA Cup and League Cup crowns during two spells at Chelsea FC.</p>
