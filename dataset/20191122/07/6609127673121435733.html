        <b>DUNDEE UNITED star Lawrence Shankland faces weeks out injured, according to reports.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Arabs hitman has been in sensational form at club level this season, following on from two great seasons at Ayr.</p>

      <p>The striker also made his Scotland debut against Russia last month, and even scored versus San Marino to bag his first for his country.</p>
      <p>However, according to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/lawrence-shankland-injury-update-dundee-20931820">Daily Record</a>, the 24-year-old is now set for a spell on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>They say that he's torn a thigh muscle while away on Scotland duty with Steve Clarke's men.</p>
      <p>It's a huge blow for Robbie Neilson at United, with the bagsman netting 17 times already this term.</p>

      <p>He picked up the injury during the warm-up ahead of Saturday's 2-1 win over Cyprus.</p>
      <p>Scans have now revealed that the attacker has suffered a small tear on his upper leg.</p>
      <p>Shankland subsequently pulled out of the squad and was replaced by <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14919/kilmarnock/">Kilmarnock's</a> Eamonn Brophy.</p>
      <p>It is believed he will be out for at least two weeks, depending on how treatment goes for the injury.</p>
      <p>It means he will miss games against Morton and Alloa.</p>
      <p>The good thing for United head coach Robbie Neilson is that his team managed to see off Queen of the South without Shankland at the weekend.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Scott Brown <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4981689/celtic-fc-news-scotland-scott-brown/">has refused to rule out a sensational Scotland return at the Euros</a>.</p>
      <p>The Celtic skipper quit the international scene for a second time in February 2018.</p>
      <p>But Brown, 34, has left the door open to pulling on the national shirt again if Steve Clarke’s side make it through March’s play-offs.</p>
      <p>Asked if Clarke was to sound him out, Brown said: “They still have two games to get through but you never say never.</p>
      <p>“It would be phenomenal to get to a finals after 22 years. Football’s a funny game and you never know.</p>
      <p>“I’m in a good place fitness-wise in terms of my body and I make sure I keep myself ticking over."</p>
