      <p>2019 has been a year of vintage and retro timepieces: from <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/3/bulova-70s-computron-led-watch-2019-release">Bulova</a> to <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/7/seiko-revives-world-first-quartz-diver-watch-1978">Seiko</a> to <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/timex-q-falcon-eye-reissue-release-info">Timex</a>, brands across the globe have reissued many of their classic models. Now, to wrap up the year, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/hodinkee">HODINKEE</a> has followed suit, bringing us back to 1986 with its latest collaboration with <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/swatch">Swatch</a>.</p>
      <p>Named the SWATCH SISTEM51 HODINKEE GENERATION 1986, the playful yet understated timepiece is inspired by the Swatch Emerald Diver released 33 years ago. While the new modern version retains certain design elements found on its predecessors, such as the mixture of red and yellow hour markings and overall rounded silhouette, HODINKEE has decided to opt out the vibrant greens and reds for a more subtle black colorway “to make it more applicable as a daily-wear option.” The case has also been increased in size to a more contemporary 42mm, fit for the 21st century.</p>
      <p>Of course, its aesthetics is not the only modernized aspect of the watch. As its name suggests, the original movement of the ’80s design has been replaced with an automatic SISTEM51 movement, a design hailed by the New York-based watch authority as “one of the most interesting mechanical developments in the watchmaking world this past decade.” Consisting of just 51 parts, the SISTEM51 is entirely built in Switzerland with no hand assembly required, and can hold a power reserve of up to 90 hours.</p>
      <p>For the watch collectors out there, the SWATCH SISTEM 51 HODINKEE GENERATION 1986 is now available over the <a href="https://shop.hodinkee.com/products/swatch-sistem51-hodinkee-generation-1986?variant=31104585924683">HODINKEE’s online store</a>, for $17o USD.</p>
