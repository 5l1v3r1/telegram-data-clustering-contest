      <p>In a Facebook update on Thursday, PUB said the water supply had fully resumed at 9.30pm and water samples tested safe for drinking and consumption.</p>
      <p>The national water agency was notified of the incident at 7.30am on Wednesday and its officers went on site to carry out "flushing" of the water network.</p>
      <p>"PUB officers carried out overnight operations and have completed the flushing of the water mains serving the internal service pipes for all camps," said the agency on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"PUB worked with BMTC to carry out flushing of the camp’s service system and the water in the BMTC main pipes is now clear."</p>
