      <h1>Club will 'listen to offers' for Nottingham Forest reported target as Leeds star is chased by Liverpool and Man United - Championship rumours</h1>
      <h2>With just over a month until the January window opens we will keep you up to date with all of the latest rumours coming from Championship</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:27:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:27</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband</a></address>
      <p>The January transfer window may still feel like a few months away but it will soon be here as teams look to add to their squads again.</p>
      <p>Trading will resume in the New Year with plenty of major transfers expected as Championship sides look to prepare for the business end of the season.</p>
      <p>And below is the latest gossip from around the division.</p>
      <h4>Gayle playing the waiting game</h4>
      <p>Newcastle United will “listen to offers” for reported <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> target Dwight Gayle in January.</p>
      <p>The Reds were said to be keen on the striker in the summer, and it has been claimed they <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/dwight-gayle-nottingham-forest-newcastle-3449184">could reignite their interest</a> when the window opens in a few weeks.</p>

      <p>Gayle has featured just twice for the Magpies under Steve Bruce this season, coming off the bench against both Chelsea and Wolves last month.</p>
      <p>And though boss Bruce has previously said the 29-year-old will get his chance, it has been suggested United will be willing to let him leave midway through the campaign.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Chronicle Live</a> report: “They’ll be listening to offers for Dwight Gayle - although don’t expect that to be advertised publicly - and if he leaves, a replacement would be possible.”</p>

      <h4>In the race</h4>
      <p>Lawrence Shankland continues to be linked with a potential January move to Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>The Scotland international striker is reportedly interesting several clubs ahead of the transfer window reopening in the new year, including Celtic and Rangers.</p>

      <p>A remarkable 17 goals in 13 Scottish Championship appearances for Dundee United so far this season has caught the eye - and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> could yet consider a January bid for the 24-year-old, following reported summer interest from the City Ground.</p>
      <h4>Putting the rumours to rest</h4>
      <p>Joe Worrall has been a key player for Lamouchi this season, following his loan spell at Rangers last term.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old was the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-make-transfer-decision-3132425">subject of some transfer speculation</a> in the summer, with the Reds understood to have turned down more than one bid.</p>
      <p>Hull City and Wigan Athletic were both believed to have shown an interest, though it is unclear whether either club were involved in making an offer.</p>
      <p>Worrall, however, has made clear his love for Forest as they prepare to return to action after the international break with a trip to Bristol City on Saturday.</p>

      <p>“Of course there’s always speculation. You see it all the time on Twitter,” said the Nigel Doughty Academy product.</p>
      <p>“But at the end of the day I’m playing for Forest - the team I love. I love wearing the red shirt.</p>
      <p>“It’s something that I’m focused on for the next game.</p>

      <h4>White in demand</h4>
      <p>Leeds defender Ben White has attracted the interest of both Liverpool and Manchester United after impressing on loan at Elland Road.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old moved north from Brighton for the season in July and has become an integral part of Marcelo Bielsa's defence.</p>

      <p>So much so that two of the Premier League big boys are weighing up a move reports the <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1384972/2019/11/20/a-white-wall-how-bielsa-built-the-football-leagues-meanest-defence-around-a-22-year-old-who-is-tempting-liverpool/">Athletic</a> .</p>
      <p>Liverpool have a real interest in the central defender while United have scouted White as they continue their recruitment policy that places an emphasis on young homegrown talent.</p>

      <h4>Clarets out of the race for Phillips</h4>
      <p>Burnley are not expected to reignite their interest in Leeds United midfielder Kalvin Phillips.</p>

      <p>Sean Dyche’s side were strongly linked with a move for the Leeds academy graduate and were believed to have made a bid for him.</p>
      <p>A number of top flight clubs were linked with the 23-year-old, with Aston Villa, Wolves and Bournemouth all credited with an interest.</p>
      <p>Phillips did sign a new deal at Elland Road in the summer in order to fend off interest and that looks to have done the trick at Turf Moor, with<a href="https://www.lancs.live/sport/football/transfer-news/every-player-linked-january-move-17262761"> reports</a> now claiming they won’t try and sign him in January.</p>
