      <p>LONDON — The physical crude oil market and</p>
      <p>the structure of the oil futures curve have rarely been more</p>
      <p>aligned over the past few years than in recent weeks, and they</p>
      <p>tell a counterintuitive story of a tight oil market next year.</p>
      <p>While OPEC and the International Energy Agency point to a</p>
      <p>swelling oil glut next year due to booming non-OPEC supplies</p>
      <p>including in the United States, the physical market offers a</p>
      <p>different story.</p>
      <p>Traders are prepared to pay near-record premiums for sweeter</p>
      <p>barrels as new marine fuel regulations from 2020 encourage</p>
      <p>refiners to switch to crude grades that produce smaller</p>
      <p>quantities of high-sulfur fuel oil.</p>
      <p>However, premiums for heavier grades, which produce more</p>
      <p>fuel oil, also continue to rally due to a deficit created by</p>
      <p>U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.</p>
      <p>In addition, the structure of the oil futures market shows</p>
      <p>that premiums of front months to later dates – known as</p>
      <p>backwardation – have narrowed in recent weeks, also suggesting</p>
      <p>the market’s expectations of a glut are diminishing somewhat.</p>
      <p>To be sure, benchmark oil futures do not necessarily follow</p>
      <p>the physical market and could still decline next year if global</p>
      <p>oil demand falls because of the U.S.-China trade dispute or if</p>
      <p>U.S. oil output surprises again on the upside.</p>
      <p>Soaring physical crude prices are also negatively impacting</p>
      <p>refining margins, often prompting refiners to cut processing.</p>
      <p>New marine fuel rules have created a rally in certain crude</p>
      <p>oil grades. From January 2020, the United Nations’ International</p>
      <p>Maritime Organization (IMO) will ban ships from using fuels with</p>
      <p>a sulfur content above 0.5%, compared with 3.5% now, unless</p>
      <p>they have sulfur-cleaning kits called scrubbers.</p>
      <p>Nigeria’s biggest crude stream, Qua Iboe , is</p>
      <p>valued at a premium of $3.30 a barrel, the highest since 2013,</p>
      <p>Refinitiv Eikon data shows. Azeri Light, or BTC , has a</p>
      <p>premium of $5.10 to the benchmark, its highest since 2013.</p>
      <p>Both crudes are valued especially highly by simple</p>
      <p>refineries as they are ideal for producing IMO-compliant bunker</p>
      <p>fuel oil, said Eugene Lindell, an analyst at JBC Energy in</p>
      <p>Vienna.</p>
      <p>“The focus now is on not producing high-sulfur fuel oil at</p>
      <p>all costs. If you are a simple refinery, it comes down to</p>
      <p>choosing the right crude,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The end result is a lot of people are going to be seeking</p>
      <p>these grades and that boosts the price. They will remain strong</p>
      <p>and may increase further.”</p>
      <p>While the rally in those two light, sweet grades stands out,</p>
      <p>sour crudes such as Russian Urals have been supported by other</p>
      <p>factors. Urals in northwest Europe is trading at a</p>
      <p>premium of $1 a barrel to dated Brent, a record high.</p>
      <p>“The strength in sour crudes, despite IMO 2020, is due to</p>
      <p>the loss of sour crude supplies from Venezuela and Iran and high</p>
      <p>demand for heavy molecules to feed the conversion units of more</p>
      <p>complex refineries,” analysts at Energy Aspects wrote.</p>
      <p>U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela have forced the two</p>
      <p>OPEC members to cut oil exports sharply, tightening the market</p>
      <p>for sour crude.</p>
      <p>Voluntary OPEC cuts due to a supply pact that producers are</p>
      <p>expected to renew in December have also curbed output.</p>
      <p>Expectations of a growth slowdown in U.S. shale could also</p>
      <p>tighten the market further.</p>
      <p>North Sea crude grades, which underpin the Brent futures</p>
      <p>contract, are also rallying. Ekofisk, one of the five grades</p>
      <p>that can set the value of dated Brent, jumped to its highest</p>
      <p>since 2013 on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The rally in physical crude is being reflected in</p>
      <p>strengthening time spreads in the Brent futures market, even</p>
      <p>though the outright price at $62 a barrel is well below</p>
      <p>this year’s high of $75.</p>
      <p>The first-month Brent contract is trading at a premium to</p>
      <p>the second month , indicating current tight supply.</p>
      <p>Backwardation persists for future months, although it becomes</p>
      <p>shallower next year.</p>
      <p>“We expect Brent oil prices to continue trading around our</p>
      <p>$60-a-barrel forecast with backwardation likely to persist as</p>
      <p>the ongoing OPEC cuts and slowing shale activity offset rising</p>
      <p>other non-OPEC supply and moderate demand growth,” Goldman Sachs</p>
      <p>said in a report this month.</p>
