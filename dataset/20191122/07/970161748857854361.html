      <p>We have already seen the third clash of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>…Get Me Out Of Here – and we are praying there’s more to come.</p>
      <p>When we thought it couldn’t get any better – TV bosses throw another two celebs in – and they have won the nation’s hearts already (we love you Cliff and Andy).</p>
      <p>Thursday night’s episode was probably one of the best ever and it’s safe to say <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> was on fire.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-a-celebritys-nadine-coyle-teaches-caitlyn-jenner-girls-aloud-dance-moves-and-its-pure-comedy-gold-11197437/">Not only did she learn the dance to Girls Aloud’s The Promise</a> (which was pure comedy gold) but she accidentally insulted newcomers <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-apologises-throws-shade-soap-stars-andy-whyment-cliff-parisi-11198083/">Andy Whyment and Cliff Parisi </a>for not knowing who they were as she questioned ‘Who are these ‘f***ing soap people?’</p>
      <p>And just in case you were wondering,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-a-celebritys-ian-wright-and-andrew-maxwell-make-up-after-crocodile-feet-row-as-the-comedian-clashes-with-jacqueline-jossa-11197129/"> Ian Wright and Andrew Maxwell have made up after they had a clash over crocodile feet (phew).</a></p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>So if you missed the jam-packed show last night, don’t panic as we have the low-down for you. But you’ll be gutted to have missed Caitlyn Jenner dancing to Girls Aloud.</p>
      <p>Here were the highlights of Thursday night’s I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here!</p>
      <h3>Ian and Andrew kiss and make up…awww!</h3>
      <p>The pair clashed over the crocodile foot (which looked like a chicken wing), after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a> Roberts and Roman Kemp won the camp a luxury meal for collecting 10 stars during the bushtucker trial.</p>
      <p>It all began when Jacqueline Jossa offered Ian an extra bit of ‘chicken’ and the comedian couldn’t help but intervene.</p>
      <p>‘Ian everyone has had some there’s two there, go,’ Andrew added.</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘Come on seriously Ian.’</p>
      <p>It was when Andrew exclaimed: ‘Jesus the drama’ when Ian got a bit snappy (see what I did there) as he raged: ‘I said I don’t want no more f***ing crocodile.’</p>

      </figure>
      <p>However, after having a good night’s sleep (well kind of) Ian and Andrew resolved their disagreement in the most manly way possible.</p>
      <p>As they relaxed in the camp Ian asked:  ‘Is everything okay because we had a moment with dinner? We cool?’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Andrew responded: ‘From my perspective, I was cool at the time, 100%, zero bother my end.’</p>
      <p>Afterwards the former footballer exclaimed: ‘Good news man, I don’t want people to have a bad day because of something I’ve said. If you know you’re wrong, say it and move on, don’t let things fester.’</p>
      <h3>Nadine Coyle teaches Caitlyn Jenner Girls Aloud dance moves – and it is the best thing EVER</h3>
      <p>Nadine Coyle taught Caitlyn Jenner how to dance to a Girls Aloud song and was the best thing to have happened so far.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline Jossa started dancing to The Promise by the girl band, and as she did Nadine taught her some of the moves.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn then asked if Nadine had danced on stage and Nadine said yes, Caitlyn smiled and said ‘I love that.’</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Caitlyn, Nadine, Adele and Jacqueline all stood up to form their own girl band and Nadine taught them the moves to the song.</p>
      <p>Talking in the hut afterwards Nadine explained: ‘I taught the girls a little bit of The Promise routine, Jacqueline and Adele knew most of it already.</p>
      <p>‘Caitlyn just threw herself into it, we’ll teach her Sound of the Underground next.’</p>
      <h3>Jacqueline and Andrew have the third clash of the series</h3>
      <p>Tonight we also saw new campmates Coronation Street star Andy Whyment and actor Cliff Parisi enter the jungle, although they were immediately sent to the jailhouse after winning the camp eight stars for dinner.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Although in another twist the celebs at the main camp could choose to share their luxury meals with the duo, who were stuck in the jail, but it meant two of the campmates would have to join them in jail.</p>

      <p>Kate Garraway and Ian Wright both agreed to go, but Roman decided the best way to agree fairly would be to draw named water bottles.</p>
      <p>The discussion then got rather heated between Jacqueline and Andrew as the mum-of-two admitted she ‘didn’t want to go’</p>
      <p>Andrew exclaimed:  ‘I think it has to be everyone in, I don’t think it’s fair to count yourself out.’</p>
      <p>James Haskell responded: ‘If she doesn’t want to do it, don’t do it.’</p>

      <p>Andrew continued: ‘It’s an ordeal that has to be shared.  It’s not back to Snake Rock, it could be anything.’</p>
      <p>Adele the added: ‘I think it’s just anybody that’s up for it. If anyone wants to stay they should be allowed.’</p>
      <p>Andrew didn’t understand why Nadine and Jacqueline wouldn’t put themselves up like everyone else.</p>
      <h3>Caitlyn Jenner opens up about being a father</h3>
      <p>Caitlyn Jenner has opened up about being a father to her children <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-a-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-opens-up-about-being-a-father-and-reveals-her-kids-still-call-her-dad-ill-be-your-dad-till-the-day-i-die-11197359/">Kylie and Kendall Jenner and revealed they still call her ‘dad’.</a></p>
      <p>The 70-year-old – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/04/11/caitlyn-jenner-liberated-after-gender-reassignment-surgery-and-admits-she-was-tired-of-tucking-it-in-all-the-time-6566938/">who had gender reassignment surgery in 2017</a> discussed with her fellow campmates about being a parent, when Kate Garraway candidly asked her what her children called her.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn responded: ‘My kids all call me dad, Kendall asked me first and I said “dad”, I’m your dad and I’ll always be your dad till the day I die.</p>

      <p>‘But what they’re really good at which shocks me all the time is when they’re talking about me, my Dad she and it’s tough to change the pronoun in the middle of it.’</p>
      <p>Kate asked if Caitlyn felt like their father, Caitlyn continued: ‘Bruce raised them and Caitlyn is enjoying their life with them.’</p>
