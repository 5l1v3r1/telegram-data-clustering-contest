      <p><b>Puducherry</b>: Puducherry is facing problems because of its unique position of being a Union territory with a legislature, said Chief Minister V Narayanasamy, urging the Centre to find a solution soon.</p>
      <p>"The government of India whenever it suits them, treats us as per their convenience as a state or a Union territory. We are neither here nor there. This is our position," Narayanasamy said at an event sponsored by the Puducherry on Thursday.</p>

      <p>The Congress leader added that the problems being faced by the Puducherry administration are similar to those of Delhi.</p>
      <p>"Both Puducherry and Delhi are in a difficult position because they are Union territories with the legislature," he said.</p>
      <p>Explaining the problems with the unique position of the state, Narayanasamy said, "Like in the case of GST, we are treated as a state and they take our money. But when it comes to the question of implementation of various schemes they treat us as a union territory."</p>
