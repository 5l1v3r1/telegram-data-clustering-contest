      <p>When a person is very committed to their goal, no challenge is big enough. Alexandra Adams, a 25-year-old medical student in her fourth year, is about to become the first deafblind medical doctor.</p>
      <p>Daily Mail reports that the 25-year-old student was registered blind as she employs the use of cane and ear aid to cope with walking and hearing.</p>
      <p>She said though the reactions from many patients have been motivating, her colleagues have great reservations about her abilities.</p>
      <p>Alexander recalled how she was sent home from her very first hospital placement because the senior doctor believed no one would want the attention of a disabled doctor.</p>

        <i>“It was on my first day of placement, a senior doctor came up to me and said 'Imagine you're a patient, would you want a disabled doctor treating you? Absolutely not'</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“And then they sent me home, sent me home on my first day. It's meant to be the most exciting day of medical school, but it was my most disappointing,” </i>she said.</p>
      <p>Alexandra said she would not allow what others think about her discourage her or make her cry as that would not do anything to help her.</p>
      <p>She said that though she is not going to be a neurosurgeon because of her sight, she can function in many areas that require more than dr*gs, blood tests and scans.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I'm obviously not going to be a neurosurgeon, I'm registered blind. But there are so many things I can do</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“Because I've had a lot of emotional challenges, I can see the perspective of life and it's so much more than the dr*gs and the blood tests and the scans,” </i>she said.</p>

      <p>The 25-year-old who has been into intensive care six different times said her experience about hospital has built her emotional intelligence, a rarity she said it is among most doctors.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <b>Legit.ng</b> earlier reported that two sisters Tara Howard and Tori Drinkard, nurses at the Piedmont Athens Regional Medical Centre, contributed <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1268925-tara-drinkard-tara-howard-identical-twin-nurses-helped-deliver-identical-twins.html">greatly to humanity as they helped deliver a set of twins</a>.</p>
      <p>An amazing thing about the two sisters is that they were born in the same hospital 26 years ago.</p>
