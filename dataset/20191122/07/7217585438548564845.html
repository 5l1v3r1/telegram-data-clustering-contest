      <h1>Google bans political advertising just before the UK general election</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:00:18+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shereesa Moodley</a></address>
      <p>Following Twitter’s recent <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/11/twitter-officially-implements-its-political-advertising-ban/">ban on political advertising</a>, Google on Wednesday announced updates to its own policies surrounding the matter.</p>
      <p>According to the updates, Google will now restrict political entities from targeting ads on its platforms in an attempt to “improve voters’ confidence in the political ads they may see”.</p>
      <p>“That’s why we’re limiting election ads audience targeting to the following general categories: age, gender, and general location,” the company explained on its <a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/ads/update-our-political-ads-policy/">website</a>.</p>
      <p>This means that political ads on Google can only be targeted to audiences according to how old they are and where they are from.</p>
      <p>“This will align our approach to election ads with long-established practices in media such as TV, radio, and print, and result in election ads being more widely seen and available for public discussion,” Google continued.</p>
      <p>Additionally, however, the company also noted that political advertisers will still be able to target “contextual” ads based on the content users read about often.</p>
      <p>Google will begin implementing the new rules ahead of the UK’s upcoming General Election.</p>
      <p>The policies will affect advertisers globally by 6 January 2020.</p>
