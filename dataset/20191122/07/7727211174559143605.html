      <p>Imelda Staunton is set to replace Olivia Coleman as The Queen in The Crown.</p>
      <p>Olivia has been stunning audiences in series three of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/casting-company-hunt-scousers-new-17279279">the Netflix show,</a> but she is rumoured to be replaced for series five and six.</p>
      <p>Imelda, 63, is due to take over to play the later years of the Queen's life, with Olivia resuming the role for series four.</p>
      <p>Claire Foy played the young monarch in the first two series.</p>
      <p>Imelda was approached by senior producers and casting directors to play the Queen from her mid-60s on - <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7712637/Imelda-Staunton-Claire-Foy-Olivia-Colman-Crown.html">reports the Daily Mail.</a></p>

      <p>Next August, she will appear in the West End in the lead role in Hello, Dolly! But in 2021 and 2022 – and possibly even into 2023 – she will be busy filming 20 episodes of The Crown.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/liverpool-stars-war-worlds-crown-17254790">The show’s</a> creator Peter Morgan and his team are currently researching the storylines that will occupy the on-screen Royal Household.</p>
      <p>One likely to be featured is the Queen’s ‘annus horribilis’ – Her Majesty’s description of 1992.</p>
      <p>In that year, the Royal Family was rocked by the separation of Prince Andrew from Sarah, Duchess of York, the fire at Windsor Castle and Princess Anne’s divorce from Captain Mark Phillips.</p>

      <p>In addition, Diana: A True Story – Andrew Morton’s warts-and-all biography of the Princess of Wales – was published which revealed details of the Prince of Wales’s affair with Camilla Parker Bowles.</p>
      <p>Other episodes are likely to deal with Diana’s death in 1997 and those of Princess Margaret and the Queen Mother within weeks of each other in early 2002. There is talk that Nelson Mandela’s visit to London in 1996 could be explored, as well as the Queen’s historic visit to Russia in 1994.</p>
      <p>Prime ministers John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are likely to be portrayed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/amazing-pictures-show-liverpool-uks-15570725">Netflix</a> made it clear before they started filming The Crown, several years ago, that they would hire new actors to take over the major roles once the incumbents completed their 20-episode stint.</p>
