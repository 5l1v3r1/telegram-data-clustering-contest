      <p>With Orlando Pirates still to be without their captain Happy Jele for their upcoming match, another defender will be going into the fixture walking a suspension tightrope.  </p>
      <p>Jele, who missed Pirates’ match against Kaizer Chiefs before the international break, will sit out the second of his two-match suspension for the red card he received against Maritzburg United.  </p>

      <p>Ntsikelelo Nyauza wore the captain’s armband against Chiefs, as was the case against Stellenbosch FC earlier in an earlier fixture, when Jele had also been suspended. </p>
      <p>However, Nyauza himself is now on a suspension tightrope, after picking up his third yellow card of the campaign, against Chiefs. </p>

      <p>Should he play against Polokwane City in Pirates’ next match on Tuesday and recieve one more yellow card, the centre-back will be suspended for the next match against Baroka FC.      </p>
      <p>In their last three matches of the year, the Buccaneers will face all three Limpopo top-flight teams in Rise and Shine, Bakgaga and Black Leopards.         </p>
