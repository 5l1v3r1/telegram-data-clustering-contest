      <p>Chris Brown has become a father again, after his ex-girlfriend Ammika Harris gave birth to their child on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The singer, 30, appeared to confirm the news on Instagram, posting a photo of him looking down adoringly at something just out of shot, with the caption: ’11-20-2019’.</p>
      <p>He also hinted at the arrival by posting a photo of him wearing a hoody, with the word ‘born’ clearly visible in large letters on the hood right after.</p>
      <p>Ammika also posted about the new baby on her Instagram story, telling her followers: ‘I was in love, when I first saw you’.</p>
      <p>Neither have spoken out with any more details about the baby as of yet, but <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/25/chris-brown-ex-girlfriend-ammika-harris-expecting-baby-boy-split-10628107/">TMZ reported back in August that the former couple were expecting a baby boy.</a></p>
      <p>Chris already has a daughter, five-year-old Royalty, with his ex Nia Guzman, and he and Ammika are reportedly on very good terms despite not being together.</p>

      <p>The pair split mid-way through the pregnancy, but Chris was said to be giving Ammika financial, medical and emotional support throughout.</p>

      <p>He had started seeing new girlfriend Indyamarie during the pregnancy, but reportedly split because of it.</p>
      <p>Although Chris and Ammika never officially confirmed the pregnancy on social media, rumours they were expecting started back in May, when he commented on a photo of her, saying ‘BM [baby mama] BAD’.</p>

      <p>Chris and Ammika were first romantically linked in 2015, and the pair confirmed their relationship when she supported him through the rape allegations earlier this year.</p>
      <p>In February, the R&amp;B singer was accused of raping a woman in a hotel room in Paris but, after being arrested, was released without charge days later.</p>
      <p>While Ammika stood by Chris during the ordeal, it’s claimed they split shortly after.</p>
      <p>There’s no news yet of the baby’s name, weight or official confirmation of whether it’s a boy or girl, but all eyes are on Chris and Ammika’s upcoming posts.</p>
