      <h1>Halle Berry Injured On Set While Filming New Movie Bruised</h1>

      <p>According to a report from FoxNews.com, Halle Berry isn’t permitting her recent injury stop her from working. Reportedly, the award-winning actress was found herself injured following an on-set mishap for her new film, <i>Bruised. </i></p>
      <p>Responding to the reports, the 53-year-old actress claims she was “just getting started.” The <i>Monster’s Ball</i> alum subsequently went on her Instagram to share her condition with fans. Ever since the star shared the news of her injury with her social media followers, many of them have shown support.</p>

      <p>Berry captioned one photo with a positive “thank you” message for all those who showed her some love. The <i>Monster’s Ball</i> alum stated that getting injured on set was a normal thing to happen for those who do their own stunts. The Oscar winner joked she was “wide awake.”</p>
      <p>After the incident went down on Monday, a representative for the film stated that the <i>Catwoman</i> alum got hurt during a fight. She was tired and needed a break, so production was expected to resume on Friday of this week.</p>

      <p>As fans of the actress know, this movie marks the first time Halle has ever sat in the director’s chair. In the film, she stars as a disgraced MMA fighter whose six-year-old child, whom she abandoned, finds his way back into her life.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Halle showed off that she had been training vociferously by sporting her abs on Instagram. Berry urged her followers to share their goals in the comment section and hold themselves to it no matter what.</p>
      <p>Berry said that it wouldn’t be easy, but the pay-off would be completely worth it. Berry isn’t the only Hollywood star to perform their own stunts. Tom Cruise is notorious for doing it all himself in movies and has even been injured several times in the past.</p>
      <p>During the filming of the latest <i>Mission Impossible</i> film in 2017, production was delayed for a few months on account of Tom suffering an ankle injury. Sources who spoke with Variety claimed the actor broke his ankle and also did some damage to his hip.</p>
