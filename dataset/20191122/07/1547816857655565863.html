      <p>Bigg Boss 13, with its endless drama, arguments and fights, is at its most interesting point right now. Sidharth Shukla is the one making the most noise in the house and he has a huge fan following outside that supports him. Recently, Asim Riaz and Sidharth Shukla and Asim Riaz got in a huge fight that turned aggressive and violent. After this, several ex-contestants of Bigg Boss and even stars who follow the show came out and expressed their opinions. Now, television actress Sanaya Irani, who shot to fame with her role in Miley Jab Hum Tum, has opened up about the contestants.</p>
      <p>Sanaya Irani, in a recent interview on Red FM India with RJ Akriti, was asked whether she would want to be locked inside the BB house, to which she said no. But she did mention that she wants to go inside and school them for what they are doing. Talking about Sidharth Shukla, she feels that he is a very rude person and doesn’t know how to talk to people and that she is very disappointed in him. She said, “I believe that the best form of entertainment is not fighting. Siddharth unnecessarily pin-points Rashami and she tries to avoid any sort of interactions with him. Sidharth is not at all playing a good game.” Sanaya Irani also does not like Asim Riaz and says, “Asim is an idiot, he is stupid. He is not mature enough to handle things and maybe that is what is going wrong with him." <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-eviction-khesari-lal-yadav-shown-the-exit-door-exclusive/5dd786c30cada251e9c310b8">ALSO READ: Bigg Boss 13 Latest Eviction: Khesari Lal Yadav Shown The Exit Door- EXCLUSIVE</a></p>

      <p>She further adds that Sidharth Shukla and Asim are both trying to overpower everyone in the house and just keep screaming and shouting. She thinks they both need to grow up. She also mentioned that she likes Rashami Desai and also Hindustani Bhau since he is adding a lot of fun. She was all praise for Paras Chhabra too and said that he is playing well and is also trying to entertain people.</p>
