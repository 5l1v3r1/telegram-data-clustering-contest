        <b>Oooft, talk about getting masterful and dominating Callum, our brows are sweating. No, we kid, believe it or not, this isn’t the Walford couple experimenting but actually Ben Mitchell (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/max-bowden/">Max Bowden</a>) showing his support for Callum Highway (Tony Clay) by helping him train for his police assessments in EastEnders.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Callum has made his ambition to join the police force clear and viewers recently breathed a sigh of relief when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/eastenders-spoilers-ben-mitchell-gives-up-his-dodgy-dealings-for-boyfriend-callum-highway-11197245/">Ben decided to go legit and support the man he loved in his chosen career</a>. Last night saw Ben and Callumembrace as Ben pledged to turn his back on his life of crime and now he is set to do what he can to help Callum join the beat.</p>
      <p>Ahead of Callum’s first tests to join the force, Ben play acts as someone Callum needs to apprehend – and comes at him with a banana (behave) which is meant to represent a gun. It’s Callum’s job to tackle Ben and disarm him.</p>

      <p>While we never thought we’d see Ben fighting for the right side of the law after his recent actions, but he steps in to help Callum practise his much needed moves to pass the first stages of the assessment.</p>

      <p>As the couple get a bit rough and ready, Callum seems to appreciate Ben’s support and dedication to helping him reach his goal. But judging by the faces on the lads here, it looks like they might have been caught in the act and have some explaining to do.</p>

      <p>We must say, Ben makes a very believable perp – it’s almost like he’s been arrested before.</p>
      <p>Ben’s decision to turn his back on crime is surely a relief to Martin Fowler (James Bye) too but any joy will be short lived as tonight, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/eastenders-spoilers-martin-stacey-returning-lacey-turner-left-11195323/">Martin gets the shock of his life when bad news reaches him about Stacey (Lacey Turner).</a></p>
