      <h1>Polarizer, QDEF supply capacity in China insufficient</h1>

      <p>Taiwan's suppliers of polarizers and quantum dot enhancement films (QDEF) still have opportunity to make gains in China where the supply capacity for these two optical products is still insufficient despite the fast expansion of its flat panel industry, according to industry sources.</p>
      <p>The global polarizer market is currently dominated by major suppliers in Korea and Japan, with the top-three vendors - LG Chem, Nitto Denko and Sumitomo Chemical - accounting for 65% of global supply. Korea's Samsung SDI ranked fourth with a 9% share.</p>
      <p>Taiwan's suppliers, including Cheng Mei Materials Technology, BenQ Materials, Optimax Technology and Wah Hong Industrial, together make up a 15%. Major makers in China, including Sheng Wave Optoelectronic, Sunnypol Optoelectronics and Win Polarizer Optoelectronics, contribute about 8%, the sources indicated.</p>
      <p>Among Taiwan's makers, Wah Hong has tapped into the small- to medium-size polarizer market in China focusing on automotive and industrial-control applications, revealed the sources, adding that polarizer shipments now account for 20% of Wah Hong's total sales.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Wah Hong and another Taiwan-based company Efun Technology have also begun enhancing their deployments in China's QDEF market where only Beijing-based Nano Top Electronic Technology is currently being regarded as a significant supplier for QDEF products, said the sources.</p>
