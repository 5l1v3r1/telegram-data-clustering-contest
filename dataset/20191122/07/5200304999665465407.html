      <p>Roshan has not revealed what he charges for a film, but according to a source the increase is substantial, <i>Deccan Chronicle</i> reported. The change applies to all filmmakers including Yash Raj Films, who will now have to pay Roshan the higher fee if they decide to bring him back for a sequel to ‘War’ (2019).</p>
