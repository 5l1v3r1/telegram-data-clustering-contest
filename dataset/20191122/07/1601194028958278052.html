      <p>With an aim of registering their first victory of the season, the defending champions of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/mzansi-super-league">Mzansi Super League</a>, Jozi Stars will lock horns with the Paarl Rocks in the 13th match of the tournament. While the Stars are at the bottom position in the standings, the Paarl-based franchise holds the fourth rank with seven points in three matches.</p>
      <p>The Stars and the Rocks have met thrice in the history of the league and the head-to-head record does not favour any of the two sides. Jozi Stars had defeated Paarl in their first meeting but the Rocks conquered them in the succeeding match. Their previous match had been abandoned due to rain.</p>
      <p>This year, the Paarl Rocks will start as the favourites because they had trounced Cape Town Blitz by 86 runs in their season opener. However, Jozi Rocks had <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/mzansi-super-league-2019-jozi-stars-appoint-neil-mckenzie-as-mentor-and-consultant">recently appointed</a> the former South African batting coach Neil McKenzie as their new mentor and consultant so, they will enter the field with a fresh mindset.</p>

      <h4>Predicted XIs</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Paarl Rocks</b>
      </p>

        <figcaption>Faf du Plessis will lead the Paarl Rocks</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Despite the defeat against Tshwane Spartans in their previous match, Paarl Rocks may not alter their match squad for the match against Jozi Stars. Skipper Faf du Plessis will expect his men to pull off a better show this time around</p>
      <p>
        <i>Predicted XI: Henry Davids, Cameron Delport, James Vince, Faf du Plessis (c), Dwaine Pretorious, Mangaliso Mosehle, Isuru Udana, Hardus Viljoen, Bjorn Fortuin, Tabraiz Shamsi, Kerwin Mungroo</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Jozi Stars</b>

        <figcaption>Can Chris Gayle return to form?</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The fans of Jozi Stars will hope that Chris Gayle returns to form soon because he has scored only 46 runs in the first four matches. Also, his strike rate of 100.00 would be worrying the fans. However, the West Indian stalwart can be backed to come off good in this match. Since the Stars' bench strength is not that strong, there should be no changes in the playing XI.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Predicted XI : Chris Gayle, Reeza Hendricks, Temba Bavuma (c), Rassie van der Dussen, Sinethemba Qeshile, Daniel Christian, Simon Harmer, Gerald Coetzee, Kagiso Rabada, Aaron Phangiso, Duanne Olivier.</i>

      <p>Reeza Hendricks and captain Temba Bavuma will have to shoulder the responsibility of Jozi Stars' batting department while Aaron Phangiso will be the player to watch out for from their bowling attack.</p>
      <p>From the Rocks, Henry Davids will have to continue his fine form with the bat whereas Tabraiz Shamsi will hold the key to Paarl's success with the ball.</p>
