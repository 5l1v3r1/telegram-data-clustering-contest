      <p>Goodness and Mercy Ministries (GMM) founder, Prophet T Freddy, has caused a massive stir after he was spotted in the Avenues area at night recently. The Prophet was spotted in the part of the Avenues area which is notorious for being one of the city’s foremost red-light districts where thigh vendors ply their trade.</p>
      <p>iHarare received the exclusive photos from an anonymous who was shocked after spotting the popular prophet in the area.</p>
      <p>Below are some of the photos,</p>

      <p>However, iHarare has noted that of late, popular musicians have been releasing pictures of themselves in apparently controversial or compromising situations, as a marketing gimmick.</p>
      <p>A few days after the controversial photos circulate, the musicians will then releasee a music video, which contains the controversial scenes. This marketing style has been used to great success by <b><a href="https://iharare.com/misred-finally-breaks-silence-_-after-jah-prayzah-affair-rumours/">Jah Prayzah and MisRed</a></b> in the past.  Trevor Dongo also recently released a <b><a href="https://iharare.com/trevor-dongo-defends-controversial-semi-nude-pic-with/">highly controversial nu_de picture with one of Jah Prayzah’s singers</a></b> as he promotes his <b><a href="https://youtu.be/2zCLIv3Otg4">latest music video</a></b>.</p>
      <p>At the time of publishing, iHarare has been unable to reach the Prophet who may have been on a mission to pray for and to make the suspected ladies of the night realise the error of their ways so that they could repent and be saved.</p>
      <p>We will update the article once we get in touch with the Prophet.</p>
