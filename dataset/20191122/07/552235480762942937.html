      <h2>The striker has been out of action since July with a serious knee injury.</h2>

      <p>St Mirren striker Cody Cooke could make his long-awaited return to action against the Staggies.</p>
      <p>The confident frontman has been working hard in training over the last few weeks as his comeback from a serious knee injury in July is all but behind him.</p>
      <p>And while Saints manager Jim Goodwin feels it would be harsh to drop Danny Mullen and Jon Obika after they both found the net against Hearts, he has backed Cody to make the most of his return when he gets his chance.</p>
      <p>“Cody will be in the squad for Saturday,” Goodwin said.</p>
      <p>“Danny and Jon have developed a half decent partnership recently and they both scored against Hearts. I don’t think it would take too much to figure out they will start.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“It is good Cody is back among the squad. He is a fantastic boy and a good pro who has worked hard to get back. He is a good option to have.</p>
      <p>“The fans here appreciate hard working players and he gives them that. You can’t have enough boys like that.</p>
      <p>“He will have to be patient and if he gets the opportunity he has to grasp it.”</p>
