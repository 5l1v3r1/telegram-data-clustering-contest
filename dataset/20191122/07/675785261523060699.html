      <h1>Jeremy Corbyn and Piers Morgan agree on something - you have to register to vote</h1>
      <h2>Millions of young people are still missing from the electoral register - and everyone from Jeremy Corbyn to Piers Morgan is demanding you sign up before the midnight deadline on Tuesday 26 November</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:27:33+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:27</time> by <a rel="author">Jason Beattie, https://www.facebook.com/Jason-Beattie-148163672552769/</a></address>
      <p>Millions could miss out on the chance to shape the country’s future unless they register to vote – and the majority are young people with 33% of them not signed up.</p>
      <p>These young voters could prove key to deciding the outcome of the election.</p>
      <p>As many as nine million people in all have yet to register or are registered at the wrong address, the elections watchdog has warned.</p>
      <p>Regardless of party loyalty, politicians, TV stars and celebrities called for people to make sure they are on the electoral roll before the November 26 deadline.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> said ahead of today’s National Voter Registration Day: “Register to vote. And if you are registered get your friends and family registered too.”</p>

      <p>Since the election was called more than two million people have applied for a vote. But the Electoral Commission says between 8.3million and 9.4million people – 17% of the electorate – have not registered or are not registered at their current address.</p>
      <p>TV presenter Piers Morgan said: “It is vitally important everyone exercises their right to vote. If you don’t, you can’t complain if you get the Government you didn’t want. So register, then get out and vote.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> and Love Island’s No Love Lost added: “It’s so important to make your voice heard for the future.”</p>
      <p>Comedian Jason Manford said: “This is a great campaign by the Mirror. Register to vote, you only have until November 26. Do it today.”</p>

      <p>Operation Black Vote said one in four black and minority ethnic people are not registered – four times higher than the national average. Only 74% of those aged 25-34 are correctly registered, falling to 68% among those aged 20-24 and 66% among those aged 18-19.</p>
      <p>By contrast 94% of the over 65s have registered.</p>
      <p>Operation Black Vote co-founder, Ashok Viswanathan said: “If we want our politicians to look like us and talk like us, we need to use our voice.”</p>
      <p>Craig Westwood of the Electoral Commission said: “It only takes five minutes to register to vote online – time that you might otherwise spend waiting for the kettle to boil or for a gym class to start.”</p>

      <p>Electoral Commission figures also reveal that 91% of home owners are registered to vote compared with 58% of people in rental accommodation.</p>
      <p>A study by the BBC found non-voters could have changed the result in 551 of the 650 Westminster constituencies if they had taken part in the 2017 election.</p>
      <p>This includes Prime Minister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> ’s Uxbridge seat where the number of non-voters, 22,798, was more than four times his majority of 5,034.</p>
      <p>Darren Hughes of the Electoral Reform Society said the missing millions of voters “makes our democracy unfair and we need to put that right through moving to universal voter registration.”</p>
