      <h1>Australia must exit coal by 2030: report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:56:24+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:56</time> by <a rel="author">Finbar O'Mallon</a></address>
      <p>AUSTRALIA needs to stop burning coal by 2030 if it wants to help limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, a new report warns.</p>
      <p>Climate Analytics says the government needed a national plan to phase out remaining coal-fired plants, and needed to take them offline faster than the existing timetable.</p>
      <p>Such a plan would help provide the energy sector with certainty, the report released on Thursday said.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Bill Hare pointed to the current bushfires in New South Wales and Queensland as a sign the country needed to curb emissions rapidly.</p>
      <p>“The realisation that climate change poses an existential threat to Australia is certainly hitting home right now,” Mr Hare said.</p>
      <p>“Australia must play its part in fighting climate change, and it could start by switching from coal to renewables in its own electricity system.”</p>
      <p>The report, using data from the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says phasing coal out completely by 2030 would allow Australia to do its bit.</p>
      <p>It warns just half a degree more warming above 1.5C would see the death of nearly all of Australia’s coral reefs.</p>
      <p>It also warned that Australia faced longer bushfire seasons, less rain and more drought due to climate change.</p>
      <p>The report stated that at the slow rate coal-fired plants were being shut down across the country, Australia would still emit twice more than what it was allowed to under the Paris Agreement.</p>
      <p>The report said 10 plants had closed since 2012 with the 19 remaining plants feeding 60 per cent of Australia’s electricity.</p>
      <p>This made it the only OECD country in the G20 that relied on coal for more than half of its energy supply.</p>
      <p>In a decade, half of these plants – which the report said were already technically obsolete – would be 40 to 60 years old.</p>
      <p>The report says Australia has natural advantage when it comes to renewable energy resources and should jump on this to move to a carbon-free energy system.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison said if Australia had cut its emissions it would still be facing its current bushfire season.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Neil Mitchell on 3AW on Friday, he said higher emissions targets would destroy regional jobs.</p>
      <p>Asked if the number and intensity of the fires was the new normal, Mr Morrison said it was certainly the advice he’d been receiving.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, climate protesters picketed a meeting of state and territory energy ministers in Perth demanding stronger government action to address climate change.</p>
