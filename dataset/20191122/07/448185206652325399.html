      <p>A CORRESPONDENT</p>
      <p><b>LAKHIMPUR:</b> Hundreds of Mising people, led by three community organizations- Takam Mising Porin Kebang (TMPK), Mising Mime Kebang (MMK) and Takam Mising Mimag Kebang (TMMK) – staged massive protest in Dhakuakhana on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The protest was initiated in order to protest against the alleged harassment caused by police and paramilitary force upon innocent people in the name of arresting accused persons involved in a case of attacking two newly-joined local BJP leaders that took place at Nepali Basti under Kherkota Gaon Panchayat on November 3. The current development was also alleged to be the outcome of the attempt of colouring an ordinary beating and flogging case as a political issue by the local MLA of the ruling party. A section of Mising community and organizations have found the alleged harassment by police and paramilitary force unbearable and initiated the programme to protest against alleged issues.</p>
      <p>Expressing vehement resentment, though the protesters who came to Dhakuakhana subdivisional headquarter after taking out rallies from different parts of the subdivision, attempted to demonstrate in front of the Dhakuakhana Police Station, they were blocked by police and paramilitary force at Dhakuakhana town Tiniali. There they rocked the environment by shouting various slogans against the BJP-led State Government and local MLA Naba Kumar Doley. They also shouted slogans demanding end to the harassment on innocent people by police, to stop the alleged use of police by the local MLA in order to make innocent people as accused in the case, not to make an ordinary beating and flogging case a political issue, to mitigate the flood and erosion problem caused by the Brahmaputra at Matmora, Kherkota and Pub Dhakuakhana gaon panchayats.</p>
      <p>Notably, confrontation between police security personnel took place while the protesters attempted to proceed further collapsing the security measures. It resulted in the promulgation of 144 CrPC by the subdivisional administration across the town to manage law and order.</p>
