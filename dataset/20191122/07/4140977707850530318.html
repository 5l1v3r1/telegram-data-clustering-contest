                      <p>The short and long of it is yes… At least according to the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/21/tottenham-linked-veteran-forward-zlatan-ibrahimovic-following/?awc=15609_1574370851_7c10bfe1b5fd6530166267ea6eba27a7&amp;WT.mc_id=tmgoff_poth-inbaff_tra_hotels&amp;utm_source=78888&amp;utm_medium=AWIN&amp;utm_content=tra_hotels&amp;utm_campaign=www.skimlinks.com"><b>Telegraph</b></a>, who believe that Mourinho is trying to hijack AC Milan’s attempts to ­re-sign Zlatan Ibrahimovic and bring him to Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
                      <h3>Mourinho will not push for Zlatan Ibrahimovic</h3>
                      <p>With Harry Kane the sole out and out striker in the side, Mourinho plans to bring the Swede as his back up striker. The only problem could be Ibrahimovic’s wage demands. However, the report suggests that Mourinho’s arrival could see them make an exception for him.</p>

                          <p>Although, Mourinho will not push for the transfer should Daniel Levy choose to change his mind. If the signing does go through, it will only be a short-term contract.  The Spurs defence will be another area that Mourinho will look to improve.</p>

                            <p>In his press conference yesterday though, Mourinho uncharacteristically stated that he didn’t want to purchase any new players.</p>
                            <p>“I don’t want to make big changes. I want to respect the base and the base is the work they did for 5½ years [under Mauricio Pochettino],” he said.</p>
                            <p>It looks like we will have to wait until January to see what Mourinho’s transfer tactics at North London will be.</p>
