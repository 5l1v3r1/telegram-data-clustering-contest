      <h3>Arsenal have entered the race to sign Erling Haaland after the teenager’s father visited their London Colney training ground, according to a report in Germany.</h3>
      <p>German media outlet <i>Sport Bild</i>, as quoted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/arsenal-step-erling-haaland-interest-strikers-father-visits-training-ground-11188483/">Metro</a>, is reporting that Alfe Inge Haaland went to visit Arsenal’s facilities this week ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The same article states that Arsenal are prepared to rival Manchester United’s interest after the 19-year-old father made a trip to Carrington earlier this week.</p>
      <p>According to the same story, Alfe Inge is advising his son to move to a Bundesliga team before the prolific striker completes a switch to the Premier League or La Liga.</p>
      <p>The report goes on to add that Arsenal and Manchester United will face competition for La Liga’s Real Madrid, Serie A’s Juventus and German club Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>The article suggests Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s previous experience of working with Haaland could give Manchester United the edge over Arsenal in the race to sign the striker.</p>
      <p>Haaland has made a prolific start to the season after a return of 15 goals in 12 games in the Austrian top flight.</p>
      <p>The teenager has also netted seven times in four Champions League fixtures this term.</p>
      <p>Arsenal signed six players in the summer transfer window but the Gunners have still struggled to piece together a sustained top-four challenge this term.</p>
