      <h1>IFFI makes an IFFY ‘goof-up’: Credits lyricist Gulzar as filmmaker Satyajit Ray</h1>

      <p>International Film Festival of India is currently going on in Goa and while they celebrate cinema and laud artists, here’s an iffy goof-up made by the team. A social media user pointed out that the website of the festival, who is in its 50th year, has a picture of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> lyricist <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gulzar">Gulzar</a> showcasing in the credit space for celebrated filmmaker <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Satyajit-Ray">Satyajit Ray</a>.</p>

      <p>In its homage section, IFFI has included Bengali film ‘Ganashatru’, which was directed by Satyajit Ray. While the credits describe him as an Indian filmmaker, screenwriter, music composer, graphic artist, lyricist and author, widely regarded as one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, the picture says otherwise. But then to err is human!</p>
