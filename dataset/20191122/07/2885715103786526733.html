      <h1>Out of Love actor Rasika Dugal: It was a challenge to be in almost every frame</h1>
      <h2>Actors Rasika Duggal and Purab Kohli on Hotstar Special's latest offering Out of Love, infidelity and more.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:22:47+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/sana-farzeen/" target="_blank">Sana Farzeen</a></address>
      <p>Hotstar Special’s latest offering Out of Love is an adaptation of popular British show Dr. Foster. Starring Rasika Duggal and Purab Kohli in the lead roles, the five-episode thriller has been directed by Tigmanshu Dhulia and Aijaz Khan.</p>
      <p>The story revolves around Dr. Meera Kapoor (Duggal), whose perfect marriage and life crumbles after she realises her husband has been cheating on her. The medical practitioner then makes some drastic life choices, confused whether to forgive, forget or fight her philander partner.</p>
      <p>Recently, the lead pair of Out of Love sat down for an exclusive conversation with <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a>. They talked about the show, infidelity and more.</p>
      <p>Excerpts from the conversation:</p>
      <p>
        <b>What is Out of Love about?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Purab: It’s the journey of Dr Meera Kapoor, who is trying to find out if her husband is cheating. And then how she deals with the reality and what stand she takes. It’s going to be an exciting journey.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tell us more about your characters and its challenges.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rasika: I was really keen to get an opportunity to do a part that was driving the narrative. So I was really happy, but the challenging part was to be in almost every frame. Thankfully, the script took care of it, and since Meera goes through an arch, it was exciting for me. She does some really unpredictable things. It would now be the audience’s call if they find me engaging enough.</p>
      <p>Purab: The difficulty was to relate to Akarsh, who is very different from who I am. Every actor tries to find common ground with their characters so that you can relate to it. But it was so hard for me as I couldn’t find anything common between us.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you feel there are more expectations around adaptations? You will also be judged and compared to the original show.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rasika: I actually didn’t think about that. You have given me a new fear (laughs).</p>
      <p>Purab: Well I don’t think there are too many people here who have seen Dr. Foster. Also, I don’t think it should come as a problem. We are confident of the talent we have on the show. They have given the best to their part. It’s a completely new audience and we have kept their sensibilities in mind while making this show. I am sure they will like it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How was it to work together after POW: Prisoner of War?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rasika: We did not have too many scenes in POW but we have known each other for a while now. So that comfort was always there. Also, it’s always wonderful to have a good co-star as you can do nothing without them.</p>

      <p>
        <b>The show also has two directors- Tigmanshu Dhulia and Aijaz Khan. Doesn’t it get difficult to follow different commands?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Purab: It is really hard, and I did feel the difference. I shot with them on different days, but it was more difficult for Rasika as she shot with both on the same day. I am not saying one is good or bad, but they both did have different vision, approach to characters and sometimes as a team, it would get tough to get on the same page.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rasika, do you think the web has been giving you more unique roles?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Absolutely, the medium has changed my life. I am so thrilled by the different shows that are being made. Also, it goes on to show that the audiences have been waiting for different content. We can always give them something run of the mill. Also, people finally realise that content is the new formula. It has also helped me reach a wider audience and play some really different characters.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Have you ever been cheated in love? How does one deal with it?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Purab: Well, we have all been cheated on in different aspects of our relationships. But I think the point is to address the bigger issue and find out what’s the reason for the friction between partners.</p>
      <p>Rasika: I haven’t ever been cheated upon. Also, I don’t think I am anyone to give tips. It’s a very personal thing. But it should be talked about and also professional help should be sought if needed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Forgive, forget or fight – what would be your choice?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Purab: It all depends on the situation.</p>
      <p>Rasika: I don’t want to pick one and then do something else later (laughs). But I too think it all depends on the moment.</p>
