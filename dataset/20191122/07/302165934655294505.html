      <p>IPOH, Nov 22 — The proclamation of Pangkor Island as a duty-free island in January next year, will not affect the mainland, said Perak Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Ahmad Faizal Azumu.</p>
      <p>He said the matter had been discussed with the Ministry of Finance.</p>
      <p>“Rumours that the mainland would also be declared tax free are mere talks and that will not happen.</p>
      <p>“I personally headed the discussion with the Ministry of Finance and there was nothing said about making the mainland area tax-free,” he said during a debate on the 2020 Perak Budget at the Perak Darul Ridzuan Building here today.</p>
      <p>Ahmad Faizal (PH-Chenderiang) said this in reply to Datuk Dr Zambry Abdul Kadir (BN-Pangkor) who intervened during the winding-up session to raise that there were objections to the proposal to extend the duty-free zone to areas outside Pangkor.</p>
      <p>On the sale of liquor in Pangkor Island when the island is declared duty-free, Ahmad Faizal said special areas would be provided for the purpose.</p>
      <p>Pangkor is an island off the coast of Lumut in Manjung district and is situated some 90 kilometres from here. — Bernama</p>
