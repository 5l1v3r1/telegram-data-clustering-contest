      <p>ZCC Mebo hitmaker Obert Chari is under fire after fellow congregant accused him of using his fame to seduce and try to bed his wife</p>
      <p>Chari’s affair with fellow churchmate Kudakwashe Muzanhi’s wife Yeukai Muzinda was exposed when Muzanhi stumbled upon a string of  inappropriate and steamy WhatsApp messages in his wife’s phone</p>
      <p>After being confronted, Muzinda confessed to her husband claiming the popular gospel artiste was the one who had been allegedly pestering her for se_x.</p>
      <p>A devastated Muzanhi confirmed the affair to <a href="https://www.bmetro.co.zw/do-as-i-say-gospel-artiste-in-messy-love-triangle/">B-Metro</a></p>
      <aside>“It’s been devastating,” he said.<br/>“What happened is that Chari as a singer from our church I have been supporting him a lot until the day I discovered that he was dating my wife. They met sometime this year in Chegutu during a church conference when my wife approached him wanting to buy his CDs.</aside>
      <p>Added Muzanhi:</p>
      <aside>“When I contacted him with a different number, he annoyed me when he bragged that he was fond of bedding married women adding that I was a bit lucky that he didn’t get enough time to be with my wife otherwise he would have slept with her.”</aside>
      <p>Muzinda could not be reached for comment but she confirmed her illicit affair with Chari.</p>
      <p>She even threatened to reveal “intimate” details of their illicit relationship if Chari refused to apologise to her husband.</p>
      <p>She further warned that if Chari remained adamant, she was prepared to “dump” her husband and elope to him.</p>
      <p>When reached for comment Chari strongly denied that there was anything untoward that had been going on between him and Muzinda.</p>
