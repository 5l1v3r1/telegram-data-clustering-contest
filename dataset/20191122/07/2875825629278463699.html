      <h1>Weekend betting tips: Four bets that could make a fortune</h1>
      <h2>Horse racing and football bets for Saturday and Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:51:43+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/robert-hynes/" target="_blank">Robert Hynes</a></address>
      <p>The Premier League returns this weekend after the international break with Manchester City's clash with Chelsea the standout fixture.</p>
      <p>There's tonnes of quality horse racing also taking place on both Saturday and Sunday as Altior and Cyrname clash at Ascot.</p>
      <p>Just over 24 hours later the Troytown goes to post at Navan which is always a fascinating contest.</p>
      <p>Here's our best bets for the weekend:</p>
      <h3>Spurs to beat West Ham 12.30pm Saturday 8/11</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho's</a> managerial reign at Spurs begins away to West Ham in the early kick-off on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Surely his arrival will see a bounce from the side currently 14h in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> are two places behind them and  haven't won a game since September. Back Spurs to have a winning start under Mourinho.</p>
      <h3>Altior 2.05pm Saturday Ascot 4/6</h3>

      <p>The two top rated chasers in the UK clash in the hugely anticipated Christy 1965 Chase at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ascot-racecourse">Ascot</a> on Saturday as Altior faces Cyrname.</p>
      <p>It will be intriguing to see Altior stepping up in trip, but I think he is such a freak of a horse that he will emerge victorious.</p>
      <p>The big question is will he stay this longer distance, but I'm going to hope he can and go on to have a crack at the King George and maybe even the Gold Cup.</p>
      <h3>Eight And Bob 2.25pm Saturday Haydock 12/1</h3>

      <p>Eight And Bob is an interesting runner for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/willie-mullins">Willie Mullins</a> in the Betfair Best Odds On ITV Races Stayers' Handicap Hurdle with Robbie Power on board at Haydock.</p>
      <p>The six-year-old, who is owned by the Act D Wagg Syndicate which includes Ruby Walsh's wife Gillian and David Casey's wife Aine, scored at Gowran Park last month and is very consistent.</p>
      <p>He looks a decent each-way price to go close for the Irish Champion Trainer.</p>
      <h3>Discorama 2.30pm Navan Sunday 15/2</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>I fancy Discorama to land the Ladbrokes Troytown Handicap Chase at Navan under top weight on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Paul Nolan's star hasn't won a race in over a year, but was only narrowly beaten in the National Hunt Chase at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/cheltenham-festival">the Cheltenham Festival</a> before finishing second to two high class Gigginstown runners in Delta Work and Champagne Classic in his two runs since.</p>
      <p>Back in a handicap, he should go very close at an each-way price.</p>
