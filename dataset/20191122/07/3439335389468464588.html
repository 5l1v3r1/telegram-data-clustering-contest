      <p>LAS VEGAS &gt;&gt; Las Vegas police shot an intruder who fought with officers before dawn today on the tarmac outside a terminal at McCarran International Airport, including an officer who was knocked unconscious, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The wounded intruder and the injured officer were hospitalized after the struggle at about 4 a.m. in a restricted baggage-handling area outside the boarding gates of the main terminal serving domestic airlines, police Capt. Nichole Splinter said.</p>
      <p>The names of the wounded man and the officers were not immediately made public. The injured officer was treated and released, said Officer Aden OcampoGomez, a police department spokesman.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear if the intruder was a passenger, but airport spokesman Chris Jones said he did not work for the airport or any of its concessionaires.</p>
      <p>Police encountered the man outside Terminal 1 about 20 minutes after officers investigated an alarm indicating that someone went through a security door at a separate passenger building, Terminal 3, Splinter said. Officers did not find anyone near Terminal 3 but then located the man near Terminal 1, she said.</p>
      <p>The man attacked the officers while he was being escorted in custody to a public area of the airport, Splinter said in video statement provided by police.</p>
      <p>One officer was knocked unconscious, and one officer tried using a less-than-lethal method to subdue the man before the third officer fired twice, Splinter said. Police did not immediately disclose whether the officer used physical means, a stun gun, baton or other device before shots were fired.</p>
      <p>Splinter said the wounded man underwent surgery at the hospital.</p>
      <p>Cellphone video taken by person who was apparently in Terminal 1, aired by KVVU-TV in Las Vegas, shows three police officers around a man sitting handcuffed on the well-lit tarmac. It does not show a struggle or shooting.</p>
      <p>OcampoGomez said police believe the man who was apprehended was the same person who entered the secure area at Terminal 3. It did not appear he had a weapon, and it was not immediately clear if he was a traveler, OcampoGomez said.</p>
      <p>The officers were equipped with body-worn cameras. The details of the struggle will be made public along with the names of the officers and the wounded man in coming days, OcampoGomez said.</p>
      <p>Airport operations and flights were not affected, Jones said.</p>
      <p>Terminal 3 primarily serves international flights and would have been quiet at the time, Jones said.</p>
      <p>A paved causeway over a sunken airport access road connects the terminals, serving as a taxiway and connector for baggage carts and airport vehicles. The route passes by the Federal Aviation Administration’s airport traffic control tower.</p>
      <p>FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said the investigation was being handled by local authorities.</p>
      <p>Police did not know how the man got between the two buildings, OcampoGomez said.</p>
      <p>McCarran is one of the 10 busiest airports in the U.S., based on passenger count. It handled just under 50 million passengers in 2018.</p>
