      <p>For being the second Nigerian to be elected UNGA President in 30 years and how this reflects on the nation, Muhammad-Bande advised that Nigerians continue to do the things that endears us to the international community and make our nation proud.</p>
      <p>“I think that we should continue to do the kinds of things that makes us acceptable to others by doing our bit in the international community and doing also great things for our country,” he added.</p>

      <p>“I’m happy that the support of all colleagues has gotten us to a good start”, he said.</p>
      <p>NAN reports that Muhammad-Bande is in Nigeria to attend a Regional Expert Conference on the Human Rights Situation of Older Persons in Africa as an Inter-sessional Event of the United Nations General Assembly Open-ended Working Group on Ageing.</p>

      <p>Muhammad-Bande’s election, was the second time that Nigeria has produced the president of UNGA in three decades and since joining the UN as its 99th member in 1960.</p>
      <p>The first was in 1989, during the tenure of late Gen. Joseph Garba, which was usually described as a flamboyant era.</p>
