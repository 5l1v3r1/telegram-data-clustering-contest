      <p>Unai Emery has revealed that Granit Xhaka will have 'a long future' with Arsenal following talks with the<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc"> Newcastle United </a>target.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/newcastle-united-arsenal-granit-xhaka-17279945">ChronicleLive previously revealed </a>that Emery planned to sit down with the 27-year-old following his return from international duty with Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Xhaka has not played for Arsenal since an angry confrontation with the club's supporters after he was substituted in the 2-2 draw against Crystal Palace last month.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has since been stripped of the captaincy but Emery believes there is a way back for Xhaka at the Emirates following Thursday's talks.</p>
      <p>"His mindset is better to help us and to be closer to playing when we need him. I spoke to him this morning and we had a very good conversation," he said. "He was training very well before the international break and he trained very well today.</p>
      <p>“My objective hasn't changed. I want him to come back, with him helping us and also convincing every supporter of his commitment to us and his performances are going to be better and we are going to be proud of him in an Arsenal shirt. He will have a long future with us - that is my objective - and I am going to work for that.</p>
      <p>“He feels better and he feels that Arsenal are his team now. He wants to come back, to have the confidence of our supporters and we are going to decide when, but I think little by little we can help him to come back and to connect again with us and with our supporters.</p>
      <p>“I want to give him confidence, ensure that he is comfortable and, also, when we can connect with our supporters with good moments, good performances and being strong with them."</p>
      <p>Steve Bruce recognises January is a difficult window to do business in, but the Newcastle head coach is on the lookout for a midfielder who could improve his side and rates Xhaka.</p>
      <p>Xhaka, who is settled in London, still has three-and-a-half years to run on a lucrative contract at the Emirates and wants a resolution sooner rather than later.</p>
      <p>"'I have a clear idea as to how things should proceed and Arsenal know this as well," he previously told SRF. "Although I still have a contract with them, I will be glad to return to the club - so we can finally sort matters out.</p>
      <p>"There will surely be a solution - as I can't accept what has happened with me."</p>
      <p>Xhaka is friends with compatriot Fabian Schar and the Switzerland players regularly talk to each other about their club situations. Indeed, Xhaka helped convince Stephan Lichtsteiner to move to Arsenal last year.</p>
