      <h1>Man City v Chelsea Preview – Team news, possible XI and betting tips</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:00:30+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Bridges</a></address>
      <p>The cracks in the almost flawless Man City side of the previous season are beginning to show. Sides have been able to identify Pep Guardiola’s Achilles Heel with some frequency. First it was minions Norwich City, followed by the Wolves at the Etihad and last week it was the current arch enemy, Liverpool. </p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s men were able to cut off the Citizen’s oxygen, which is their counterattacking. The Reds’ defensive formation afforded little space for the likes of Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva to manoeuvre. </p>
      <p>No doubt, the absence of Aymeric Laporte and Oleksandr Zinchenko has hurt them badly at the back, but folks like Jon Stones, Kyle Walker, Benjamin Mendy and Nicolas Otamendi are no babes in the woods either. </p>
      <p>Frank Lampard has concerns too, what with his best from the past couple of weeks, Christian Pulisic nursing a hip injury. The 21-year-old American has been in transformative form and a far cry from the player who was struggling for form under Maurizio Sarri. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>With five goals already notched up this season, Chelsea won’t want to be without Pulisic on the 23rd. Besides Pulisic, the Blues will be without long-time absentees Ross Barkley and Antonio Rudiger.</p>
      <p>Even with their somewhat clumsy defence and a disjointed attack, the hosts could be a handful. Raheem Sterling is back from a very successful Euro qualifiers campaign for England and a striker of Kun Aguero’s class will not be expected to repeat the missed opportunities of last week at Anfield. </p>
      <p>Which is why the odds of 41/100 (general odds) are on a City win. </p>
      <p>
        <b>The chances of the points being shared are much more worthwhile to wager on. You can get odds of around 39/10 quoted by </b>

        <b> on this outcome. </b>
      </p>
      <p>For the visitors it’s general  odds of 33/5 for a win which the more adventurous can go for.</p>
      <h3>Predicted Line Ups</h3>
      <p><b>Man City probable starting XI:<br/></b>Bravo (goal); Walker. Stones, Fernandinho, Mendy; David Silva, Rodri, De Bruyne; Jesus, Sterling, Aguero</p>
      <p><b>Chelsea probable starting XI</b>:<br/>Kepa (goal); Azpilicueta, Zouma, Tomori, Emerson; Kovacic, Jorginho, Kante; Mount, Abraham, Pulisic</p>
      <h3>Bookmaker odds</h3>
      <p>Both teams to score: 61/100</p>
      <p>No home clean sheet: 13/25</p>
      <p>Correct score: 2-2 12/1</p>
      <p>The Blues have only won once in the last 6 outings against their weekend opponents. But under Frank Lampard, the South West London are on a different plane currently and can be expected to make things pretty tight for Guardiola &amp; co.</p>
