      <p>Instagram big boy and Bureau De’ Change operator, Ismaila Mustapha aka <a href="http://concisenews.global/entertainment/">Mompha</a> has filed a suit against anti-graft agency, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) alleging unlawful detention and violation of his rights.</p>
      <p><a href="http://concisenews.global/">Concise News</a> reports that EFCC arrested Mompha on October 19, in Abuja, over alleged cyber-crime and money laundering.</p>
      <p>Mompha has now filed a fundamental rights enforcement suit, asking the court to award N5m against the EFCC for detaining him beyond the constitutionally-allowed period without being charged to court.</p>
      <p>He prayed the court to order the EFCC to either immediately charge him to court or release him if it was not ready to charge him to court.</p>
      <p>The Instagram big boy’s lawyer, Mr Gboyega Oyewole (SAN), says his client, as a Nigerian, was entitled to the protection of his fundamental rights under sections 34, 35 and 36 of the 1999 constitution.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the acting chairman EFFC, Ibrahim <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/01/arrest-of-mompha-koudeih-is-landmark-achievement-efcc-boss/">Magu had described the arrest of the Bureau De Change operator as a testimony</a> in fight against internet related fraud.</p>
      <p>“Investigation has also revealed that <a href="http://concisenews.global/entertainment/">Mompha</a> operates 51 bank accounts in Nigeria with which he acquires properties in Dubai and had laundered about N14billion through a firm known as Ismalob Global Investments Limited.” he said</p>
      <p>Mompha, is renowned for his luxurious lifestyle which is well portrayed in his flagrant display of expensive cars, wristwatches, and bewildering landscapes and properties on Instagram.</p>
