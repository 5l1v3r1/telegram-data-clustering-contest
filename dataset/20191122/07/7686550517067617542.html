        <figcaption>I'm A Celeb fight erupts among entire camp as <b>Jacqueline and Nadine</b> spark row</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The I'm A Celebrity camp descended into chaos after two contestants refused to be sent to the Jungle Jailhouse.</p>
      <p>Two of the campmates, Jacqueline Jossa and Nadine Coyle, refused to go which sparked a massive fight across the entire camp.</p>
      <p>After getting eight stars in their bushtucker trial, new campmates Cliff Parisi and Andy Whyment became outlaws and were sent to the jailhouse.</p>

      <p>Tempers started to flare when the main camp were then presented with two choices.</p>
      <p>They had the opportunity to be "good, bad or downright ugly" - and either keep all the food themselves, or choose to feed the outlaws with their share of food.</p>
      <p>The twist with the second option was that two campmates would have to join the outlaws in the jailhouse.</p>

      <p>Andrew Maxwell and James Haskell both agreed they were happy to go to the jailhouse, while Kate Garraway and Ian Wright also said they would sacrifice themselves.</p>
      <p>Former footballer Ian suggested they should draw straws, so the group picked out named water bottles to decide who would go.</p>
      <p>However, Jacqueline said it was "scary" and admitted she did not want to leave the main camp.</p>
      <p>Kate asked if she would rather not go, while Ian said she didn't have to, but Jacqueline confessed: "Yeah but it’s not very heroic."</p>

      <p>Comedian Andrew Maxwell did not see the funny side and insisted everyone should be in the hat.</p>
      <p>He said: "I think it has to be everyone in, I don’t think it’s fair to count yourself out."</p>
      <p>Rugby star James said Jacqueline should not be forced to go, but Andrew argued: "It’s an ordeal that has to be shared."</p>
      <p>Andrew turned to the former EastEnders star and said: "It’s not back to Snake Rock, it could be anything."</p>

        <figcaption>Nadine also said she wanted to stay at main camp<cite>(Image: ITV/REX)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Giving her opinion, Adele Roberts added: "I think it’s just anybody that’s up for it. If anyone wants to stay they should be allowed."</p>
      <p>Tensions quickly began to rise in camp as Jacqueline and Nadine both expressed they did not want to take part and would prefer to remain in Main Camp.</p>
      <p>Talking in the Bush Telegraph, Andrew said: "Jacqueline and Nadine said they didn’t want to go and erm…that’s the end of that…"</p>
      <p>The comedian could not understand why Nadine and Jacqueline wouldn’t put themselves up like everyone else.</p>

      <p>Eventually, the campmates picked their named water bottles out of a bag and it was decided that Kate and Andrew would go to the Jailhouse.</p>
      <p>But that was not the end of the drama, as Jacqueline said James didn't mind going if Kate wanted to stay.</p>
      <p>However, they all agreed to stick to the original plan so Kate and Andrew left camp to join Andy and Cliff at the Jungle Jailhouse.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn asked the rest of the campmates if they knew who Andy or Cliff were, so Roman Kemp explained who Kirk from Coronation Street was.</p>
