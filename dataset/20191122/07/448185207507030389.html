      <p><b>DHUBRI:</b> The Assam Linguistic Minorities Development Board distributed cheques among beneficiaries to carry out trade, business and to start small production units, at a function presided over by former Principal of Bholanath College, Prof (Rtd) Girindra Nath Goswami at Dhubri District Library Auditorium on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Besides the cheques of Rs. 20,000 as one-time grant-in-aid, sewing machines and solar home light set under schemes for 2018-19 were also distributed among the 136 beneficiaries.</p>
      <p>Speaking in the meeting, vice-chairman of Assam Linguistic Minorities Development Board, Ram Krishna Ghose said the board had wanted to give away more amount of financial assistance to the linguistic minorities but that could not be possible due to some technical problems.</p>
      <p>“This time we are giving Rs 20,000 each of the beneficiaries selected maintaining strict guidelines and norms laid down by the board. But next time onwards, the amount will be increased to Rs 1 lakh,” Ghose added.</p>
      <p>Ghose also alleged that this board was there when the Congress was in power in the State and fund was also available, but it did not bother to distribute financial aid among the linguistic minority communities.</p>
      <p>“Linguistic minority communities need not worry about NRC or politics of opposing the Citizenship Amendment Bill as Chief Minister Sarbanand Sonowal has assured to protect their socio-economic and political rights,” Ghose said.</p>
      <p>The meeting was also addressed by Dhubri District Development Commissioner Banashree Nath, Executive Officer of Dhubri Zila Parishad, Purabi Konwar, and District Information and Public Relation Officer Jiten Das.</p>
