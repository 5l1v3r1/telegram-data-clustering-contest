      <h1>Jim Goodwin urges fans to stay positive as St Mirren finally return to action in Paisley</h1>
      <h2>The Saints gaffer believes the fan backing at home so far this campaign has given his players an "extra lift".</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Ramage</a></address>
      <p>Tomorrow will mark five long weeks since <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> stepped out on their own patch, where they have only lost once this season.</p>
      <p>And St Mirren manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jim-goodwin">Jim Goodwin</a> can’t wait to get back to business in Paisley when they return to the Simple Digital Arena to take on Ross County.</p>
      <p>He told Express Sport: “It’s been weeks since we’ve been back on our home soil so we’re looking forward to it.</p>
      <p>“There’s no place like home, as people say. The players love the surroundings here and hopefully we can get two really positive results going into the really difficult games coming after that.</p>
      <p>“We’re in a really good frame of mind going into the game on Saturday. The home form has been excellent. We’ve only conceded one goal and that was from a free-kick against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a>. That gives us confidence.</p>
      <p>“It is important anyone coming to Paisley knows they won’t have an easy afternoon. We have to make sure we get in their faces and are hard to beat and horrible to play against.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Goodwin believes the fans continual backing has played a huge part in the Buddies’ successful run in Paisley.</p>
      <p>He feels their positivity is reflecting back in the players’ performances.</p>
      <p>He said: “The players really enjoy playing at home at the moment and the fans play a huge part in that.</p>
      <p>“They generate a really positive atmosphere and that reflects on the players on the park.</p>
      <p>“That positive mindset comes from the stands onto the pitch and gives the players an extra lift.”</p>
      <p>The Buddies were forced to train at the stadium early this week due to the harsh frost at Ralston.</p>
      <p>Goodwin tries to minimise the amount of time the Saints spend on the pitch to protect it. But with the gap between the last home game, a 2-0 win over St Johnstone on October 19, and tomorrow’s clash being so long, he hopes that might have helped them visualise a win on their overdue return.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “It’s definitely a good idea to train at home. I’d like to try and protect the pitch as best we can.</p>
      <p>“I don’t like getting on it too often because I don’t want to wreck it, but it’s great for the players to be able to visualise being back there again on Saturday and scoring some goals in training. Hopefully that will benefit us.”</p>
      <p>Despite coming up into the Scottish Premiership, Ross County have punched above their weight so far this campaign and currently sit sixth in the table.</p>
      <p>While Goodwin isn’t one for revenge after the Staggies sucker-punched their way to a win against St Mirren in Dingwall, he appreciates the importance a win tomorrow.</p>
      <p>He said: “Ross County are a difficult team. We did well against them in September and should have taken something. We lost out to a last-minute winner.</p>
      <p>“I watched them against Hamilton a few weeks ago and they were decent.</p>
      <p>“It’s a huge game for both teams. If we play to the levels we’re capable of then we have got more than enough to win the game.”</p>
      <p>We’ve got some very good players and can cause them problems.”</p>
