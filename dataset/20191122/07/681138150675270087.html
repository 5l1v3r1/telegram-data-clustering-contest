        <b>The medical director at the region's mental health trust is stepping down from his position.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bohdan Solomka, who was appointed in 2015, will no longer serve on the Norfolk and Suffolk Foundation Trust's board.</p>
      <p>No reason has been given for his stepping down, but he will continue to work at the trust in a clinical position.</p>
      <p>Announcing the news, NSFT chair Marie Gabriel said he may be stepping down from the board - but the trust "isn't losing him altogether".</p>
      <p>Chief executive Jonathan Warren paid tribute to his colleague, and added: "(Bohdan) has been a joy to have around during my short tenure here of seven to eight months.</p>
      <p>"At times he has been the voice of reason, and he is a kind, decent and honourable man.</p>
      <p>"I am so pleased that he is staying on and patients will benefit from his clinical practice."</p>
