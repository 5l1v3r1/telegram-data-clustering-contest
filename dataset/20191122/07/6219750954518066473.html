      <p>Architecture theorist, historian, and curator <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/beatriz-colomina">Beatriz Colomina</a> talks about our discipline and its difficulty to accept the work as the result of a collaborative effort. When asked about sexism and <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/gender">gender</a> issues within architecture, Colomina broadens the discussion and tackles the historical myth of architecture as the product of one single, brilliant - and always masculine - mind. A fiction that has obscured the role of a number of women, and whole teams, committed to the design process.</p>
      <p>Founding director of the Program in Media and Modernity at Princeton University, Colomina visited <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/country/brazil">Brazil</a> for the opening of the <a href="https://www.archdaily.com.br/br/tag/12a-bienal-internacional-de-arquitetura-de-sao-paulo">12th São Paulo International Architecture Biennial</a>, where she presented her work on the relation between social media and public spaces. In a world where many youngsters are <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/926957/the-robin-evans-lecture-2019-beatriz-colomina">working from their beds</a>, she argues that architecture needs to review the role of such private space and rethink its relation to the urban realm.</p>
