In fact it was Wagon Wheel-y good. <br/>Cliff Parisi and Andy Whyment (can you not have less tricky names to spell, gents?) brought some much needed silliness onto our screens.<br/>They took part in the Bushtucker Trial – and Andy couldn't stop laughing as he watched from his sofa (or behind the window).<br/>After getting 8 stars for camp, it was off to jail for them both.<br/>Another spat in Main Camp erupted and Kate Garraway and Andrew found themselves trotting off to jail with their tail between their legs.<br/>Twitter went mad as Jacqueline and Nadine threw their toys out the pram and said they didn't even want to offer to go to prison. <br/>They didn't even bother to pretend. Which is why Jacqueline then got voted to do tomorrow's Bushtucker Trial by viewers. <br/>But who's worse? Jac for telling the truth and saying she didn't want to go – or Kate for lying to be nice and saying she 'didn't mind'.<br/>Oh, the British stiff upper lip.<br/>“It's OK. I'll take the bullet. As long as I look like a nice person.”<br/>Nadine taught Caitlyn, Jac and Adele the routine to The Promise from Girls Aloud. It was hard to tell the difference. At one point I thought I was watching The Brits. <br/>Meanwhile, the camp was treated to a thimble of Wagon Wheel after a successful Dingo Dollar challenge which left the team in tears. <br/>They were besides themselves. Maybe it was stale. <br/>See you tomorrow for more Jungle juicing. </li>
