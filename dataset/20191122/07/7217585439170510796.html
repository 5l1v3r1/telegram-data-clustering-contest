      <h1>Meet Showmax Mobile: a R49pm mobile-only streaming service for Africa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:11:39+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:11</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Walker</a></address>
      <p>Understanding the <a href="http://memeburn.com/2019/11/africa-5g-huawei-paul-scanlan-africacom-2019/">challenges of the African data landscape</a>, Showmax on Friday announced the debut of a new low-cost <a href="https://www.showmax.com/eng/welcome/za">mobile-only streaming plan</a> called Showmax Mobile.</p>
      <p>The new tier is the company’s play to bridge the gap to mobile-only users.</p>
      <p>“This is all about an African service developing a solution that meets the needs of African consumers,” said Niclas Ekdahl, CEO of Multichoice’s connected video division.</p>
      <p>Showmax noted that streaming video services require vast amounts of data delivered at swift speeds, something that the majority of the continent is still without.</p>
      <p>“The model relies on consumers being comfortable with transacting online and having ready access to credit cards. None of these conditions are present for the majority of people in Africa,” the company added.</p>
      <h3>What is Showmax Mobile?</h3>
      <p>Showmax Mobile offers users single-stream viewing on a mobile device at SD quality (480p).</p>
      <p>This differs from the Standard offering, which allows for up to 1080p resolution and two concurrent streams.</p>
      <p>Users can’t watch Showmax Mobile on their TVs, but tablets are also accepted according to documentation.</p>
      <p>In terms of content, the company is focusing on providing live sport streaming with seven Premier League, Serie A and La Liga football matches all lined up to stream before month’s end.</p>
      <p>It also promises “hit African content, first and exclusive international series, [and] the best kids’ shows”.</p>
      <h3>How much is Showmax Mobile?</h3>
      <p>The Standard offering is priced at R99 at present, but Showmax Mobile comes in at R49 per month.</p>
      <p>For Nigeria, that’s N1450 and Kenya KSh 375.</p>
      <p>The company notes that it’s working with Vodacom in these two countries to offer add-to-bill payments to skirt the need for credit cards.</p>
      <h4>Revised apps now rolling out</h4>
      <p>The streaming company on Friday also announced the rollout or “revised apps” including profile management, parental functionality, a new kids’ section and “improved” My Lists.</p>
      <p>These revisions are currently rolling “out to about 5%” of the user base at present.</p>
