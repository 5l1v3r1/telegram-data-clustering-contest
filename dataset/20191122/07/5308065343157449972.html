      <p>MCU’s Avengers: Endgame success this year cemented its status as an iconic pop culture phenomenon.</p>
      <p>The end of the Avengers phase was a bittersweet moment for fans after it impacted their lives for over a decade.</p>
      <p>Some of you may have heard about the theories of alternate endings in Avengers:Endgame.</p>
      <p>Marvel has released several deleted scenes throughout the franchise exclusively on the newly-launched Disney+ so you can put the rumours and theories to rest.</p>

      <p>One of the scenes that garnered the attention of fans features Iron Man (Tony Stark) meeting his grown-up daughter Morgan, played by 13 Reasons Why star Katherine Langford.</p>

      <p>Just like how Thanos met the younger version of Gamora in Infinity War, Tony supposedly meets Morgan after the snap.</p>
      <p>Morgan tells Tony that she got to live and got to grow up but she couldn’t answer what happened to her dad.</p>
      <p>After talking, they hugged and Tony said the famous line, “I love you 3000.”</p>
      <p>Two other scenes went viral on Twitter recently.</p>

      <p>The first scene shows when Black Widow and Hawkeye were attacked by Thanos’ men on Vormir as they were choosing who should jump off the cliff.</p>
      <p>The next scene was when the whole Avengers gang strategised on how to get rid of the Infinity Gauntlet and attack Thanos.</p>
      <p>These scenes with alternate endings are on Twitter.</p>
      <p>We hope to have Disney+ available soon so we can watch all the deleted scenes.</p>
      <p>In other news, Disney announced five new untitled Marvel movie release dates. They run through to 2023 and we are having a look at the upcoming releases of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
