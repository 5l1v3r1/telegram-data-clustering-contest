      <p>A <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/arrests-ordered-in-philippines-vaping-ban-263361">Philippine</a> Airlines flight bound for Manila suffered an apparent engine failure on Thursday shortly after takeoff from Los Angeles and made an emergency landing, authorities said.</p>
      <p>All 347 passengers and 18 crew aboard Flight 113, a Boeing Co 777 widebody, are safe, an airline spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>Pilots of flight 113 declared an emergency and reported a possible engine failure, Los Angeles International Airport said. A witness on the ground described "bursts of flames" coming out of an engine.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said the plane returned and landed safely. Television station ABC-7 in Los Angeles aired video of the aircraft after takeoff that showed flames and smoke coming out of the right engine.</p>
      <p>The plane landed around noon local time and was met by the Los Angeles Fire Department, the airport said. The emergency landing did not affect other flights.</p>
      <p>Although the cause of the apparent engine failure was not immediately clear, it comes as Boeing faces intense scrutiny over twin deadly crashes involving its 737 MAX single-aisle jetliner. The 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide since March.</p>
      <p>GE Aviation, a subsidiary of General Electric, which makes the GE90 engine for the 777 twin-aisle jetliners, said it was aware of the incident and was "working with the airline to determine the cause of the event and to promptly return the aircraft to service."</p>
      <p>Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
      <p>"You saw bursts of flames, little flames shooting out from the engine," said Andrew Ames, a 36-year-old fitness professional in Los Angeles, who watched as the 777 ascended over the ocean after takeoff. "It almost looked like backfire flames from a motorcycle or car."</p>
      <p>"I had never seen a plane spew flames repeatedly. Then it stopped. As soon as it stopped, I saw the plane bank left, like it was heading back to the airport," Ames said.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/want-to-ban-toxic-vaping-philippines-president-duterte-263244">Philippine</a> Airlines spokeswoman said the flight crew noticed smoke in the plane's second engine, declared an emergency and returned safely to the airport.</p>
      <p>"All passengers are safe and sound," spokeswoman Cielo Villaluna said. "They are all being assisted to another flight."</p>
