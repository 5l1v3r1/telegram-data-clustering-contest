      <h1>Formula E now plan B for F1 drivers - Massa</h1>
      <h2>Formula E is fast becoming the obvious 'plan B' for Formula 1 drivers.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:01:03+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:01</time> by <a rel="author">GMM F1</a></address>
      <p>That is the view of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/felipe-massa/"><b>Felipe Massa</b></a>, the former 11-time grand prix winner for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/ferrari/"><b>Ferrari</b></a> who now drives in the increasingly popular all-electric series.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/mercedes/"><b>Mercedes</b></a> and Porsche have signed up for the new Formula E season, which kicks off this weekend in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>Other former F1 drivers on the grid are <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/brendon-hartley/"><b>Brendon Hartley</b></a>, Pascal Wehrlein, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/stoffel-vandoorne/"><b>Stoffel Vandoorne</b></a> and others, while the new Formula 2 champion <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nyck-de-vries/"><b>Nyck de Vries</b></a> is racing for the new works Mercedes team.</p>
      <p>And while Formula 1 features only four carmakers, in Formula E there are six, also including Audi, BMW, Nissan and Jaguar.</p>
      <p>"Formula E is doing exactly what needs to be done. It is growing," 38-year-old Massa told the Mirror.</p>
      <p>"When a championship is growing and getting bigger and bigger, all the big names are interested. It was the only championship I was looking to come and race after Formula 1."</p>
      <p>Formula E aside, there are still multiple premier racing categories for professional drivers to consider, like Indycar, Super Formula, WEC and DTM.</p>
      <p>Massa said: "I concentrate on Formula E, because I believe in the future of Formula E more than I believe in the future of the other championship.</p>
      <p>"I am sure that any driver that does not have the possibility to stay in Formula 1, they will try and come to Formula E. I am 100 per cent sure.</p>
      <p>"Every driver here can race in Formula 1 and everyone here can be successful in Formula 1 in the end," added the Brazilian.</p>
