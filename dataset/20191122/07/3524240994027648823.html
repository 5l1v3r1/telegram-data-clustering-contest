      <p>The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, has deployed 1000 policemen to assist traffic personnel in tackling the gridlock that has made commuting unbearable in the state.</p>
      <p>The state Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, said in a statement that Odumosu, who called an emergency meeting at the command headquarters to review the traffic situation in the state, said the policemen would also curb the menace of traffic robbers.</p>
      <p>He stated that Odumosu also reviewed the time schedule of traffic wardens to run between 10am and 10pm, while the second shift would run from 10pm to 10am to provide 24 hours coverage.</p>
      <p>“They will all operate in their usual reflective jackets. The measure will help in ensuring free flow of traffic and will also curb the menace of traffic robbery,” Elkana added in the statement.</p>
      <p>Odumosu was said to have asked Lagosians to accord the police officers maximum cooperation while discharging their duties.</p>
      <p>In attendance at the meeting were Deputy Commissioners of Police, Department of Finance and Administration, Department of Operations, Criminal Investigation Department and Rapid Response Squad.</p>
      <p>Also in attendance were Area F Commanders, Area Operations Officers, State Traffic Officer, Divisional Traffic Officers and the Chairman, Lagos State Task Force on Environmental and Special Offences, among others.</p>
