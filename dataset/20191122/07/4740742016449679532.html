      <h1>Aldi has a 'bargain hour' when items are reduced by 50% - and it could save you a fortune</h1>
      <h2>This is definitely worth knowing...</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Pugh, Emma Grimshaw</a></address>
      <p>Anyone who shops in Aldi already knows the supermarket is filled with bargains.</p>
      <p>From cheap bottles of award-winning wines, to the store's famous Specialbuys, there are lots of reasons to nip into your local store.</p>
      <p>However, what you may not know is that the shop has a 'bargain hour', when it reduces the food which is about to expire by a massive 50 per cent.</p>
      <p>And interestingly these discounts are not always offered at the end of the day, reports <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/when-aldi-reduces-food-items-17291065">Manchester Evening News.</a></p>
      <p>Several shoppers have reported finding items with 50 per cent off labels at opening time - which is 8am for many stores across Bristol.</p>
      <p>To be absolutely sure you don't miss out on a bargain, you're best contacting your local branch to find out what time they put out their stickered items.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the reduction hour, a spokesperson for Aldi said: "All items are reduced to 50 per cent of the recommend sales price before stores open on their best before or use by dates."</p>
      <p>So if you want to grab yourself a bargain, get to Aldi bright and early!</p>
