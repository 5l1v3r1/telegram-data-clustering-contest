          <b>A JUNIOR doctor may not be the job you'd expect from a beauty queen, but Miss World's British contestants are on a mission to change the 'airhead' stereotype.</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Some 120 girls from across the globe landed in London on Wednesday, to take part in the 69th annual pageant - with the final on December 14.</p>

      <p>Fabulous Digital spoke exclusively to Miss England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, to find out how they've been preparing for the three-week competition.</p>
      <p>From working out five times-a-week to extensive beauty regimes and pre-show rivalry, here's what they revealed...</p>
      <h3>Miss England - Dr Bhasha Mukherjee, 24, from Derby</h3>
      <p>Bhasha may have two degrees and work as a junior doctor, but she says no-one blinks an eyelid about her side job as a beauty queen.</p>
      <p>Miss Scotland - Keryn Matthew, 24, from Midlothian</p>

      <p>Keryn, who has a degree in Ancient History and used to work in PR and communications, put her career on hold for Miss World - but insists she doesn't think of herself as a model.</p>
      <p>She said: "I love it when people judge the competition because I can explain it's completely different to that.</p>
      <p>"There’s no bikini competition anymore, which I don’t really have anything against, but it’s not the style of Miss World.</p>
      <p>"I love telling people it's evolved and is very modern, I like to think of myself as an ambassador for my country rather than anything pageanty.</p>
      <p>"I'm not a model, I'm only 5ft 4ins, but when I was younger I used to love Miss Scotland, I remember seeing this gorgeous girl with a tiara in the newspaper."</p>

      <p>As well as the standard workouts, Keryn's been using electric muscle stimulation to stay in shape - a £350 technique which promises six pack abs without any sit-ups.</p>
      <p>She said: "I've been keeping really fit, working out four to five times-a-week.</p>
      <p>"It's not the most pleasant feeling but it's definitely fun."</p>

      <p>With a three-week stint in London ahead of them, preparations weren't just about tweaking their looks.</p>
      <p>Keryn joked: "I’ve got all my bags lined up. I think my mum is so happy to see the back of me and all my preparations.</p>
      <p>"We're away for a month and I know it's only London and I'm in Scotland, but I'm trying to plan what I'm going to wear every day."</p>

      <p>Although there's no group chat yet, Keryn says the contestants have been keen to get to know each other.</p>
      <p>She said: "We're all on social media and I've been following every girl I've managed to find so far.</p>
      <p>"I've been feeling the same support back, we will comment on one another's Instagrams and I've had a few direct messages saying 'I can't wait to meet you'.</p>
      <p>"There's more of a community rather than rivalry. I think it's going to be a real sisterhood."</p>

        <figcaption>Miss England is Bhasha Mukherjee, 24, a junior doctor from DerbyCredit: bhasha05/Instagram</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>She told us: "I think it's misunderstood, every single medic I know is really good at something they do on the side, it's important to give yourself a break and take yourself away from the stresses of the job.</p>
      <p>"I do feel pageants are viewed negatively but it’s surprising when I meet people in real life, because they are a lot more positive about it when they get to know me.</p>
      <p>"It’s a question of getting to know the girls that are doing the pageants, rather than judging pageants as a whole.</p>
      <p>"I think the people that are around us are all that matters. The rest of the world’s opinions really matter to me personally."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Bhasha, who has Indian heritage, was first signed up for pageants by her mum - but it wasn't Miss England she had in mind.</p>
      <p>She said: "I was in the modelling industry for about seven years before Miss England came along.</p>
      <p>"A few years ago my mum really wanted me to do pageants, she actually signed me up for Miss India.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't really practical because I was in the middle of medical school, I would have had to drop everything and go over there, but with Miss England I could just carry on.</p>
      <p>"It was still hard, but a lot more feasible."</p>
      <blockquote>I just see pageants as a job interview<cite>Dr Bhasha MukherjeeMiss England</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Bhasha says there can be some rivalry in the run-up to the event, but insists that all fades away once the girls get backstage.</p>
      <p>She said: "The rivalry is always beforehand. You have been seeing these people through social media, you don't get to see the real person.</p>
      <p>"I think the rivalry is pretty limited to that, when you meet these girls it becomes a journey everyone is going through.</p>
      <p>"You've got to do your thing but at the same time you are supporting each other, it's a bit of both.</p>
      <p>"Backstage it's a lot of waiting around and that can feel quite nerve-wracking, you are in a constant stage of adrenaline which is quite draining and exhausting.</p>
      <p>"In Miss England I opened the show for the talent round and I was shivering when I came off stage from all the nerves.</p>
      <p>"I remember someone gave me a hug and I needed that. Everyone does stick up for each other because you're all feeling it."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In the past, pageants have been criticised for their focus on looks and the infamous bikini round, which was canned in Miss World over a decade ago.</p>
      <p>The girls are all stunning but Bhasha insists the competition is not skin deep - with all 120 contestants backing a charity they're passionate about, as part of Beauty With a Purpose.</p>
      <p>She said: "I have never felt that I’m being judged on my looks in any pageant that I’ve done.</p>
      <p>"I just see pageants as a job interview, you dress up, you do your make-up -how you present yourself and the confidence you walk with is easily judged in a job interview.</p>
      <p>"The resume counts so much, how much charity work you've done, what you do as a job, all these factors play a part."</p>
      <blockquote>I’m not just representing England, I'm representing the NHS<cite>Dr Bhasha MukherjeeMiss England</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Bhasha has been working out five times-a-week with a trainer, but says she'd never want to be a size zero.</p>
      <p>She said: "I have been training a lot. I'm a self-proclaimed non-sporty girl, but I enjoy boxing so I've been moving with an MMA trainer.</p>
      <p>"Whenever I'm in Derby, I train four or five times-a-week. I wanted to learn self-defence and aim for a strong body, rather than a skinny body.</p>
      <p>"Working as a junior doctor, it's not practical for me to be a size zero. I wasn't trying to lose weight but gain muscle.</p>
      <p>"I feel like I’m not just representing England. My NHS colleagues have been very supportive of this and I feel more honoured to representing the NHS."</p>
      <h3>Miss Northern Ireland - Lauren Leckey, 21, from Stoneyford</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Lauren works for her family concrete business. It was set up by her dad, who was left paralysed by a motorbike crash over a decade ago.</p>
      <p>She said: "I'd never modelled before entering Miss Ireland. When I tell people I'm a beauty queen, they're normally surprised as it's not something you hear all the time.</p>
      <p>"Some people think it's just about how you look but from doing the competition I know it's about your personality and what you have to give.</p>
      <p>"When I was doing Miss Ireland, I was one of the only ones who never went to university."</p>
      <blockquote>I'm bringing five long dresses, a few jumpsuits and cocktail dresses, probably eight or so<cite>Lauren LeckeyMiss Northern Ireland</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Lauren insists there's no rivalry between the girls, and says she was messaging everyone on Instagram ahead of the event.</p>
      <p>She said: "When I did Miss Ireland we got on so well. I'm still in a group chat with 23 other girls, most are a similar age to me.</p>
      <p>"I was a bit worried going into it, not knowing what to expect, but all the girls were really nice.</p>
      <p>"You're having a good crack, you nearly forget you're there for a competition."</p>

      <p>When it comes to pre-show rituals, Lauren admits it can be time-consuming - and says she starts a couple of days before.</p>
      <p>She said: "Normally I'll put my curlers in overnight, that would take me 45 minutes to wash, dry and pin it.</p>
      <p>"I tan the night before and shower it off in the morning, and I'll get my nails done as well.</p>
      <p>"Most of my prep is the night before and then make-up would take an hour. Getting your dress on takes a few minutes as well.</p>

        <figcaption>Lauren still has a group chat with all her Miss Ireland competitors</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"I've got lots of dresses for London. I'm bringing five long dresses, a few jumpsuits and cocktail dresses, probably eight or so.</p>
      <p>"But normally for work I'll just wear some BB cream and a pair of jeans and a shirt with trainers or boots.</p>
      <p>"I don't like wearing loads of make-up or tan and I wouldn't curl my hair for work, but I would if I was going shopping on the weekend."</p>
      <h3>Miss Wales - Gabriella Jukes, 23, from Port Talbort</h3>

      <p>Gabriella is a full-time model and says she's spent the last five years preparing for this competition.</p>
      <p>She said: "When I was 17, I thought 'I'm just going to enter Miss World and see how it goes'.</p>
      <p>"I fell in love with everything the platform stood for, I haven't really looked back.</p>
      <p>"I feel like I've been preparing for this for five years.</p>
      <p>"I've been an ambassador for Thrive Women's Aid and worked so hard on my modelling for five years, so it's been a long time coming."</p>
      <blockquote>Of course you have to look good, but it's more about what you bring as a person to the role of Miss World<cite>Gabriella JukesMiss Wales</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Gabriella, who has a degree in sport and exercise science, insists there's more to Miss World than beauty.</p>
      <p>She said: "I'm really looking forward to the fitness round, because of my background in sport.</p>
      <p>"I see it as a kind of Olympics, which I would have loved to do when I was in athletics.</p>
      <p>"I've never really experienced any negativity towards doing pageants.</p>
      <p>"My family have all really supported it and see how much Miss Wales has helped me personally, I used to be quite a shy girl.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>"I don't really care what other people's opinions are, if there is any negativity I'll take it on the chin.</p>
      <p>"I'm quite thick-skinned and every girl I've met at Miss World is very intelligent.</p>
      <p>"It's a platform to use our voices and show other girls they can achieve anything in life.</p>
      <p>"Of course you have to look good, but it's more about what you bring as a person to the role of Miss World.</p>
      <p>"You've got to look after yourself but I don't really feel a pressure (from the judges) to do it. It's about eating healthily, exercising, just looking after yourself.</p>
      <p>"Miss World is more about natural beauty, there's no need for women to have work done.</p>
      <p>"You're a role model to young girls, it's about showing them it's OK to be you."</p>
