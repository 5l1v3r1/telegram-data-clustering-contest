        <i>Here are all the latest transfer rumours...</i>
      </p>
      <h4>Gaitan linked with Villa move</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> are one of three Premier League clubs battling over the signing of free-agent Nicolas Gaitan, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old will be available on a free transfer in January, with his contract expiring at MLS club Chicago Fire in December.</p>
      <p>Gaitan has enjoyed a good spell in the States, netting four times and creating 11 more. A run of form that has reportedly turned heads of suitors in England’s top flight.</p>
      <p>According to the Guardian, Villa, West Ham and Sheffield United are all keen on the former Benfica winger.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Austria hot-shot tipped for transfer</h4>
      <p>Villa are keen on Austria Wien striker Christoph Monschein, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old, who has 13 goals in 18 appearances for club and country this season, is Wien’s most saleable asset and his sale could help to alleviate some financial concerns.</p>
      <p>Sport 24 (via Sport Witness ) have suggested that Villa are interested in the striker, but have been put off by his high asking price.</p>
      <p>The report claims that his club are looking for €5m, for the player described as their ‘super striker’.</p>

      <h4>Bruce tips McGinn for United</h4>
      <p>Former Villa manager <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a> says <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/john-mcginn">John McGinn</a> has the ability to play for Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Bruce is preparing to bring his Newcastle United side to Villa Park on Monday night (8pm) and has been recalling some of his final acts as Villa boss before he was sacked in October last year.</p>
      <p>Dean Smith replaced him and led Villa to promotion back to the Premier League via the Championship's play-offs with McGinn netting his ninth goal of the season in a 2-1 defeat of Derby County at Wembley.</p>
      <p>But it was Bruce who brought McGinn to B6 in the summer of last year and what a signing it has turned out to be with his impressive start to life in the Premier League seeing him touted with a move to Manchester United.</p>

      <h4>Mourinho gives Spurs transfer wishlist</h4>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has reportedly already given Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy a three-man transfer wishlist after replacing Mauricio Pochettino as the club's new manager.</p>
      <p>Mourinho gave his first press conference as Tottenham manager on Thursday after being appointed on Wednesday - 12 hours after the club sacked previous boss Pochettino.</p>
      <p>But while 'The Special One' faced the media, behind the scenes he has been hard at work identifying transfer targets who can restore Tottenham to the form that saw them reach last season's Champions League final.</p>
      <p>One of Mourinho's top priorities will be to convince contract rebels Christian Eriksen, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld their future lies with Tottenham.</p>

      <h4>Brighton boss addresses Liverpool and Man United speculation</h4>
      <p>Liverpool and Manchester United have been warned Ben White is not for sale after the Brighton defender's impressive displays on loan at Leeds United.</p>
      <p>White has become an integral part of Marcelo Bielsa's defence at Leeds, sparking reports that Liverpool and Manchester United are weighing up January moves for the centre-back.</p>
      <p>But Brighton manager Graham Potter says White's future is with the Seagulls - and says the south coast club are not interested in selling him.</p>
      <p>“There’s all sorts of talk as we know, but the reality is he’s our player and has a future here," Potter said of White, ahead of Brighton's Premier League clash at home to high-flying Leicester on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Manchester United are said to have been quoted a £75million fee to land Haaland, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer keen to push for a move.</p>
      <p>But Salzburg share the same owners as RB Leipzig, with reports in Germany claiming they will be offered the chance to sign him for just £25.7m.</p>
