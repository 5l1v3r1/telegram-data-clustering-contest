      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T07:18:27+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 07:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-web-desk/" target="_blank">Express Web Desk</a></address>
      <p>Come December 1, traffic across India’s various toll plazas are expected to reduce drastically as the government will implement the FASTag programme. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has made it mandatory for all vehicle owners, both private as well as commercial, to have FASTags installed in their vehicles. The move is aimed at reducing long queues across toll plazas by digitising toll collection across all the highways of the country.</p>
      <h3>What exactly is a FASTag and how will it help?</h3>
      <p>For beginners, FASTag is a digital tag which is based on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. The tag is stuck on windscreen of vehicles. Vehicles having the FASTag will not require to stop near the toll counters because the toll tax will automatically get deducted from the prepaid or bank account linked to the vehicle owner, all of this while the car is in motion. The transaction will be done in a cashless manner under the National Electronic Toll Collection (NETC) programme.</p>

      <h3>Which banks provide FASTag?</h3>
      <p>A FASTag can be bought at select bank branches of any of the 23 certified banks under the NETC programme (npci.org.in/netc-live-members). Some of the key banks include HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Yes Bank, State Bank of India (SBI) and Punjab National Bank (PNB). If you have a bank account in the listed certified banks, you can easily avail a FASTag and even have an option to link it to your bank account.</p>
      <p>Here is how you can purchase a FASTag from banks:</p>
      <h3>HDFC Bank</h3>
      <p>HDFC Bank, the country’s biggest private sector lender by market value, is allowing the customers to apply for a FASTag on its website. The account holders just need to sign in on the bank’s <a href="https://getprepaidcard.hdfcbank.com/fastag/index.aspx">dedicated FASTag page</a>, after which they will be required to fill in the details of their vehicle including registration number, owner name, vehicle class etc.</p>
      <p>After this step, they will be required to upload a soft copy of their supporting documents and then they will be asked to review the application before proceeding to payment. the FASTag card will be delivered on the customer’s doorstep.</p>
      <h3>ICICI Bank</h3>
      <p>ICICI Bank, another major private sector bank of the country, is allowing interested customers to apply for FASTag on its <a href="https://www.icicibank.com/Personal-Banking/cards/prepaid/fastag/index.page">dedicated web page</a>. On clicking ‘<a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/apple/">apple</a> now’ the customers will be taken to the application page where they would have to fill in their personal details including name, date of birth email, mobile number and then at the bottom of the page, they will need to select a preferred ID proof.</p>
      <p>On clicking next, the bank will ask the customer for their address details and then the vehicle details. Finally, it will ask the customers to confirm their application and will be asked to pay. thereafter the customers will get their new FASTag delivered at their address.</p>
      <h3>State Bank of India</h3>
      <p>The country’s largest lender does not have any portal for online application of FASTag, however, SBI’s website notifies a customer care number 1800-11-0018, where the bank’s executives will guide the callers to the nearest point-of-sale (PoS) location. After the customer reaches the POS, they will be able to apply for the FASTag on the location.</p>
      <h3>Punjab National Bank</h3>
      <p>PNB, which is one of the top public sector banks in the country, too lets the customers apply for a FASTag from its website. Just like ICICI Bank, here too, the customers will need to provide their details and the details of their vehicle with supporting soft copies of the documents before proceeding for payment.</p>
