      <h1>Rocks leave Stars defence hanging by a thread</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Firdose Moonda</a></address>
      <p>Jozi Stars' title defence hopes are hanging by a thread after losing a fifth successive match in the Mzansi Super League (MSL). Although mathematically it is still possible for them to make the playoffs, they will need more than just their own results to go their way. Despite shuffling their batting line-up, the Stars did not manage to score enough runs and their 129 for 3 was never going to be enough against a strong Paarl Rocks side. <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/296597.html">James Vince</a> picked up from his undefeated 86 against the Spartans last Sunday, scoring 43 to ensure the Rocks successfully chased down their target inside 17 overs. They move to third on the table, four points behind leaders, the Nelson Mandela Bay Giants.</p>

        <b>Will Chris Gayle play his 400th T20 in South Africa?</b>
      </p>
      <p>In his 399th T20 game, <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/51880.html">Chris Gayle</a> was dropped down the order to No.3 after a poor start, with 46 runs in five innings so far. At first, the move seemed successful. Ryan Rickelton and Reeza Hendricks opened the Stars' innings with a strong stand of 64 in 9.4 overs before Rickelton was dismissed for 40. That brought Gayle to the crease with enough of a foundation to get going immediately. But Gayle only managed a single before he was struck on the pad by Hardus Viljoen and given out. Replays showed the ball had pitched outside leg but with no DRS, Gayle would not have even been able to review. He is now in danger of leaving the tournament without making much of an impression or completing a personal milestone. Gayle is available for one more match in this tournament when the Stars play the Tshwane Spartans on Sunday. If he plays, it will be his 400th, but the Stars have already hinted they made need to make significant changes to their side.</p>

        <b>Magic tricks</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/southafrica/content/player/379145.html">Tabraiz Shamsi</a> has packed his phone away for this season and is now showing off his skills as a magician in the making. Shamsi keeps a handkerchief in his pocket which turns into a wand, and when he takes a wicket, he brings it out in celebration. The contraption made its first appearance in this edition of the MSL when he had Hendricks caught at long-off. None of Shamsi's team-mates went too close to him when the catch was taken, perhaps knowing he needed some space, and allowed the Paarl crowd to see their very own Harry Potter at work.</p>

        <b>KG on the comeback trail</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/southafrica/content/player/550215.html">Kagiso Rabada</a> has not looked his usual sprightly self since the tour of India, until his first ball at Boland Park. It wasn't the first ball of the innings, as it might ordinarily have been. Rabada was used as first-change after Gayle was given the new ball, and he quickly showed what he is capable of. He fired in a full delivery outside off, and Henry Davids, who was caught on the back foot trying to cut, inside-edged onto leg-stump, which went cartwheeling away. Rabada returned in the 15th over, with the cause all but lost and managed to have something of a last say when he caught Mangaliso Mosehle off his own bowling. A lengthy check for a no-ball showed that Rabada was just on the line and Mosehle had to go. Rabada could have had a third off the next ball but Gayle dropped an Isuru Udana skier at point.</p>

        <b>Olivier's over</b>
      </p>
      <p>The match was tensely poised with the Paarl Rocks on 64 for 4 halfway through their chase, still needing 66 runs off the final 10 overs when Duanne Olivier released the pressure with an over that cost 15. Vince was the beneficiary of Olivier's misdirected line down leg and the vacant third man area, where he sent three, successive boundaries. The required run-rate dipped under six an over after that, and dipped to four when Simon Harmer's second over cost 17. There was no stopping the Rocks from there.</p>
