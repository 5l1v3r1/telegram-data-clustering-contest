      <p>Manny Pacquiao’s camp has welcomed back Floyd Mayweather after he revealed his plans to come out of retirement in 2020.</p>
      <p>Mayweather has announced that he will be ending his retirement next year to work alongside <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ufc/">UFC</a> president Dana White in what could be another exhibition fight.</p>
      <p>Last year, Mayweather earned $9 million (£7m) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/12/31/floyd-mayweather-destroys-tenshin-nasukawa-swift-ko-first-round-8295937/">for his exhibition contest against Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa, who he beat inside three minutes</a>.</p>
      <p>Mayweather has not yet revealed what his next move will be but it appears the prospect of a rematch against Manny Pacquiao is off the table.</p>

      <p>Responding to Mayweather’s latest plan to come out of retirement next year, Pacquiao’s manager Sean Gibbons told The Athletic: ‘Viva Floyd !! Let’s Go Champ.’</p>
      <p>Mayweather beat Pacquiao in their highly anticipated fight in May 2015 and a rematch has been touted ever since that event.</p>
      <p>But speaking earlier this week, Mayweather was adamant that he would not be returning to boxing.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve got calls to get back into the ring, but my health is my wealth,’ he told Reuters.</p>

      <p>‘Boxing is a very, very brutal sport. In the last few years a lot of fighters have died inside that squared circle.</p>
      <p>‘You have got to know when to hang it up. I had a great career.</p>
      <p>‘I’ll still travel and do exhibitions. I make great money doing exhibitions; between $10 and $30 million.</p>
      <p>‘I think I make more doing that than most fighters make fighting.’</p>
