      <p>THE MOTHER OF a 21-year-old Longford man who died after being punched in New York last year has said “there are no winners” in the case as a Dublin man pleaded guilty to the assault.  </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/2019/1121/1094401-new-york-assault-guilty-plea/">RTÉ has reported</a> that 26-year-old Steven O’Brien yesterday pleaded guilty in a New York court to assaulting Danny McGee, who died after being punched outside a pub in Queens last year. </p>
      <p>O’Brien will now serve six months in prison for the offence. His sentence was agreed in a plea deal at Queens County Criminal Court yesterday. </p>

      <p>McGee (21) was found lying unresponsive on the ground outside the pub in Queens in the early hours of the morning on 22 November last year. </p>
      <p>He was later pronounced dead in hospital, with the cause of death being determined as a blunt impact injury to the head.</p>
      <p>Speaking to RTÉ outside the court, defence lawyer Matthew Gartenberg, on behalf of O’Brien, said “it’s a very sad day for everyone”. </p>
      <p>“[O'Brien] is remorseful, very apologetic, and he’s very sad about the whole thing. It’s been a very tough year and it’s a life altering experience, which hopefully no one ever has to go through or experience,” Gartenberg said. </p>
      <p>A number of members from the McKee family travelled to New York from Ireland for yesterday’s hearing. </p>
      <p>McGee’s mother Colleen spoke to reporters outside the court. </p>
      <p>“There really are no winners here today. Regardless of what happened, Danny will never come back,” she said. </p>
      <blockquote>We miss him every second of every day, and that’s how it’s going to be. </blockquote>
      <p>When asked if six months was enough, she said she didn’t think anything would make her happy and that “there’s nothing that’s going to bring Danny back”. </p>
      <p>“Whether he went for six months, six years, it’s not going to make a change in my life going forward,” she said. </p>
      <p>Colleen McGee described her son as a “wonderful, wonderful kid” who had his “whole life ahead of him”. </p>
      <p>“He was a friend to everyone, young and old. He was caring, he was funny. He was a great kid, and everyone misses him,” she said. </p>
      <p>RTÉ has reported that O’Brien was released on continuing bail and will return to court on 8 January for sentencing. </p>
