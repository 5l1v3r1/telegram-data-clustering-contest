      <p>President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani accepted President Donald Trump’s invitation to visit the United States, the ARG Presidential Palace said.</p>
      <p>Presidential spokesperson Sediq Sediqqi said President Ghani and President Trump spoke on the phone on Thursday evening in which the two leaders had detailed discussion about peace process and the important progress the Afghan forces have made on the battlefield.</p>
      <p>“President Trump thanked President Ghani for his efforts and support in ensuring the release of the two American University professors from the Taliban’s captivity”, Sediqqi said, adding that the two leaders also praised the efforts of Afghan security forces in defeating the Daesh in Nangarhar province.</p>
      <p>According to Sediqqi, the two leaders also discussed the Afghan government’s 7-point peace plan. “In response, President Trump insisted on a ceasefire as precondition before negotiations.”</p>
      <p>President Trump also stated that for any process to succeed, the Afghan government’s inclusion in the talks and their ownership and leadership of the process from the outset is imperative, which must begin immediately, Sediqqi added.</p>
      <p>He also added “Finally, the U.S. president extended an invitation to President Ghani to visit the White House, which the president accepted.”</p>
