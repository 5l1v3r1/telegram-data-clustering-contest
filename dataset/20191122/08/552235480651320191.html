      <p>Motorists could be delayed for around an hour after a two-car crash led to the closure of the A82 at Dumbarton this morning.</p>
      <p>The route was shut southbound but a contraflow is now operating with traffic allowed to pass on one line in each direction.</p>
      <p>This has had a knock-on effect on drivers heading northbound as a result of the collision at Milton.</p>
      <p>Inspector Mo Boyle of Dumbarton Police Office told the Lennox Herald: “This will have a significant impact on traffic during rush hour this morning.</p>
      <p>“We will work to clear the roads as quickly as possible but ask everyone to be patient.”</p>
      <p>Traffic Scotland confirmed drivers heading southbound should expect a delay of approximately one hour and those heading northbound could be held up for around 45 minutes as a result.</p>
      <p>West Dunbartonshire Council confirmed that school transport may be affected and advised pick up and arrival times could be impacted.</p>
      <p>First Bus confirmed there will be delays on services 1, 1A, 1B and 1E due to the incident.</p>

      <p>Their school buses have also been impacted and they have confirmed potential delays to MyBus.</p>
      <p>A statement from the Dumbarton firm said: “We have various members of staff also stuck in traffic. We will update as soon as possible.”</p>
