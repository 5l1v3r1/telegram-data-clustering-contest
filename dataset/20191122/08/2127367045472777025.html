"There is a lot of excitement for the day-night Test. The good part is it is happening for the first time in India. It will be interesting to see how the SG pink ball behaves. I hope it will be a good game and Bangladesh would be able to compete," Gambhir told ANI.</p>
      <p>India and Bangladesh are playing the second Test of the series at Eden Gardens in Kolkata. The visitors' won the toss and elected to bat.</p>
      <p>When asked about the challenges with the pink ball he said it will be challenging for batsman initially but once they get their eyes set, it will get easier.</p>
      <p>"You won't get an experience of pink-ball unless you play with it. It is a matter of about 15-20 minutes while you are batting then you get used to it. In bowling, it will not bring any change. There can be issues while fielding in catching the ball. The biggest factor will be the dew and how they handle it," Gambhir said.</p>
