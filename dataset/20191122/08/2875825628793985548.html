      <p>Miley, 26, and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liam-hemsworth">Liam Hemsworth</a> , 29 - Chris' brother - announced they were calling it quits on their marriage back in August.</p>
      <p>They'd tied the knot just eight months before, with the pair on/off dating for a decade previously.</p>
      <p>Now, Spanish model Elsa Pataky has broken her silence and struck out at the pop star for her handling of the break up, saying Liam "deserves much better."</p>
      <p>"My brother-in-law," the blond beauty told <a href="https://us.hola.com/celebrities/2019112130208/chris-hemsworth-elsa-pataky-liam-miley-cyrus-breakup/">Hola! magazine</a> , "Well...after a relationship that you've dedicated ten years to, he's a little bit down but he's coping well.</p>

      <p>She added that the support of brother Chris has been a huge help for Liam.</p>
      <p>Elsa continued: "You always find support in your family, and he's joined at the hip with his brother, who's been there to give all the strength he needed."</p>

      <p>She was referring to the time Liam spent kicking back at Chris and Elsa's Byron Bay mansion in Australia following his split from Miley.</p>
      <p>Elsa and Miley were firm mates - and even got matching tattoos three years ago as a symbol of the strength of their friendship.</p>
      <p>Back in August, a representative for Miley told <a href="https://people.com/music/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-split/">People magazine</a> : "Liam and Miley have agreed to separate at this time. Ever-evolving, changing as partners and individuals, they have decided this is what's best while they focus on themselves and careers.</p>

      <p>"They still remain dedicated parents to all the animals they share while lovingly taking this time apart. Please respect their process and privacy."</p>
      <p>Miley dated Kaitlynn Carter for a time, before moving on with Aussie singer Cody Simpson - though the pair are now surrounded by split rumours.</p>
      <p>When they first went public, Miley's manager dished that he reckoned she and Cody go well together because they've moved on from their wilder, hard-partying days.</p>
      <p>Liam, meanwhile, was snapped out on dates with model Maddison Brown.</p>
      <p>He was reportedly taking the blossoming relationship slowly, with a source telling <a href="https://www.who.com.au/">WHO</a> : "[The relationship is] very new. Liam is taking it slow but he's definitely interested in her."</p>
