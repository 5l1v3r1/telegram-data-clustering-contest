      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- Troopers say a fatal hit-and-run crash caused roadblock on State Road 82 in Lehigh Acres Friday morning.</p>
      <p>According to Florida Highway Patrol, the crash happened a little after 7 a.m. on S.R. 82 at Gregory Avenue.</p>
      <p>The Lee County Sheriff's Office is also on scene, reporting that all westbound lanes of S.R. 82 are closed, and that drivers should seek alternate routes if possible.</p>
      <p>FHP tells Fox 4 that two fatalities are involved. They say that two vehicles were stopped on the roadside to repair a flat tire when a pickup truck crashed into both vehicles and left the scene.</p>
      <p>The road is expected to remain closed until approximately 11 a.m.</p>
