      <p>Neymar, who has been sidelined with a hamstring injury since October, upset PSG officials during the international break when he made an unscheduled visit to Madrid, Spain, after being invited to the Davis Cup by former FC Barcelona teammate Gerard Pique. </p>
      <p>PSG manager Tuchel has since revealed that he is upset about the Brazil international's actions, but added that his and the team's priority remain focused on their upcoming fixtures, in which Neymar could make his return.</p>
      <p>"What can I do? I'm not his father. I'm not the police. I'm the coach," Tuchel said, as reported by <i>Sky Sports.</i> </p>
      <p>"As a coach, am I happy with this trip? No, not at all, it's clear. Is this the time to get mad? No, no, it's not the moment. He was very professional here for two weeks. He did more than the others.</p>

      <p>"He has trained with the group, he has individual work. And if everything goes well, he can play tomorrow (Friday). We have to decide if he will start the game or be a substitute.</p>
      <p>"He will bring his quality and be decisive. If he plays for us, we are more dangerous in front of goal and he is a decisive player. He gives this for the team and it's necessary if we want to keep winning."</p>
      <p>Neymar has been a controversial figure in Paris since arriving from Barca in 2017 for a world record fee of €222 million (R3.6 billion), and alienated him from sections of the fanbase after publicly courting a return to the LaLiga giants at the start of the season. </p>
