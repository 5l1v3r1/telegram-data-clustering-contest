      <p>She chose not to make anything other than a short statement in response to questions shortly after <a href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/politics/alex-salmond/1026266/in-full-alex-salmond-denies-rape-two-indecent-assaults-and-11-sexual-assaults/">Alex Salmond had appeared at the court in Edinburgh</a>.</p>

      <p>Salmond, of Strichen, Aberdeenshire, appeared for a preliminary hearing before Lady Dorrian, where he faced 14 charges alleged to have taken place over a six-year period.</p>
      <p>According to The Herald newspaper, the SNP leader said: “The only thing I would say, as first minister, and as an ordinary citizen, is that my only interest is in seeing justice done, whatever that may be, but that of course is a matter for the courts with all due process.”</p>
      <p>Ms Sturgeon was asked whether the case would impact on the upcoming election.</p>
      <p>She replied. “No, I don’t.</p>
      <p>“But I’m not going to comment any further on that.</p>
      <p>“You appreciate anything at all I say about or around this issue has the potential to lead to coverage and headlines that would not be helpful in terms of ensuring due process and a fair trial.</p>
      <p>“So I am going to respect the court process here because I think that is in the overriding interests of everybody involved.”</p>
      <p>Ms Sturgeon now lives in the first minister’s Bute House residence where many of the alleged sexual offences are claimed to have taken place.</p>
      <p>She took over from Alex Salmond as first minister after he stepped down in the wake of the failed Scottish independence referendum, through which he led the nationalists, in 2014.</p>
