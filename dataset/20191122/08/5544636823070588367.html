      <p>Jose Mourinho has said his predecessor Mauricio Pochettino is free to come back to the club to see the players and staff whenever he misses them.</p>
      <p>Concise News understands that <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/19/epl-tottenham-sack-manager-pochettino/">Pochettino was sacked on Tuesday</a> with <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/20/tottenham-appoints-jose-mourinho-as-head-coach/">Mourinho taking over</a> from him on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>Speaking in his first press conference as the club manager on Thursday, Mourinho expressed optimism that he (Pochettino) will find happiness again.</p>
      <p>“He can come when he wants,” Mourinho said. “When he miss the players, when he miss the people he works with. The door is always open for him.”</p>
      <p>Also, the 56-year Portuguese gaffer said he has always been humble, admitting that he had made mistakes in the past but have learned his lessons.</p>
      <p>“I think so. You are what you are but I had time to think about many things,” he said when asked if he is now a better manager than he was when<a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2018/12/18/manchester-united-sack-jose-mourinho/"> Manchester United sacked him</a>.</p>
      <p>“I realised that during my career, I made mistakes and I’m not going to make the same mistakes. I’m going to make new mistakes.</p>
      <p>“I am humble. I am humble enough to try to analyse my career. Not just the last year but the problems and the solutions. The principle of my analysis was not to blame anyone else.</p>
      <p>“I’m nobody to advise people but to have a break was very positive for me. Having the first summer where I didn’t work was not good for me.</p>
      <p>“I was a bit lost. But it was good for me. I even learned how to be a pundit.”</p>
      <p>He added: “I was always humble. The problem was that you didn’t understand that. I was always humble but it was in my way.”</p>
