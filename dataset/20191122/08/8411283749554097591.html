      <p>The memory market market is expected to recover next year, but suppliers remain cautious about expanding output. Samsung's bit growth for <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191121PD215.html">NAND flash output</a> reportedly may drop to as low as 25%. In the foundry sector, China-based Wuhan Hongxin Semiconductor Manufacturing (HSMC) is aspiring to become the country's most advanced constract chipmaker. <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191121PD214.html">HSMC</a> is gearing efforts advancing to 14nm and 7nm manufacturing nodes. Chinese firms have been ambitious about advancing their technologies and expanding tgheir market presence, in line with the country's bid to raise self-sufficiency. Now China has set up a new fund to promote the development of <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191122PD202.html">new materials</a> for industrial upgrades.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191121PD215.html">Samsung NAND flash bit supply growth to drop below 30% in 2020</a>: Samsung Electronics' NAND flash bit supply growth is expected to drop below 30% and even 25% in 2020, down from 35-40% this year, according to industry sources.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191121PD214.html">Chinese foundry HSMC gearing up for 14nm, 7nm chip production</a>: Wuhan Hongxin Semiconductor Manufacturing (HSMC), a logic IC foundry founded in late 2017, is gearing up for 14nm and 7nm process manufacturing eyeing to be China's most advanced contract chipmaker.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191122PD202.html">China sets up fund for industrial upgrades with focus on new materials</a>: China has set up a CNY147.2 billion (US$20.94 billion) national fund aimed at spurring transformations and upgrades at its manufacturing industries to turn the country into a smart production center, according to industry sources.</p>
