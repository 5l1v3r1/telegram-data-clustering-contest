      <h1>Ronaldo ready to make amends as injury-hit Juve take on Atalanta</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:08:12+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>MILAN: </b>Cristiano Ronaldo conceded he is not ‘100 percent’ despite his goal spree for Portugal but always ready to play as injury-hit Juventus head to Atalanta on Saturday looking to extend their unbeaten run this season to stay top of Serie A.</p>
      <p>Juventus visit fifth-placed Atalanta before hosting Atletico Madrid in the Champions League next week.</p>
      <p>Maurizio Sarri’s side are just one point ahead of Antonio Conte’s Inter Milan after 12 matches, with Lazio and Cagliari eight points adrift of the leaders in joint third.</p>
      <p>Atalanta have gone three league games without a win and will be eager to get back into the Champions League berths, as they sit two points off fourth place, before next week’s trip to Shakhtar Donetsk.</p>
      <p>Atalanta’s fortunes have slipped following the thigh injury suffered to Colombian star Duvan Zapata, who scored six goals in six Serie A matches before being sidelined for their last five league games.</p>

      <p>As Atalanta sweat on Zapata’s return, Juventus will be without full-back Alex Sandro, who picked up a thigh problem playing for Brazil, with Blaise Matuidi recovering from a rib injury.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo had said he was not be at his best physical form, with Sarri saying the Portuguese star has a “little knee problem”.</p>
      <p>But the 34-year-old wants to make amends after storming off when he was substituted in Juventus’s last game against AC Milan.</p>
      <p>“In the last three weeks, I have played at a slightly reduced capacity,” Ronaldo conceded after his goal spree for Portugal.</p>
      <p>“I don’t like to be replaced, no one does,” added Ronaldo. “I tried to help Juve even when injured.”</p>
      <p>Full-back Danilo, who scored his first goal for Brazil during the international break, warned: “The games after the international break are never easy, let alone against Atalanta, a team who are doing well.</p>
      <p>“We can’t make mistakes or underestimate them.”</p>

      <p>Inter will be looking to make it a perfect seven league games on the road this season as they travel to Torino, before their European trip to Slavia Prague.</p>
      <p>Conte’s side face a tough task against the Andrea Belotti-powered Torino, who ended their six-match winless run against Brescia last time out, and are in 11th position.</p>
      <p>Serie A runners-up Napoli are in crisis, having slipped to seventh, and desperately need a result at 14th-placed AC Milan, who are themselves floundering.</p>
      <p>Cagliari and Lazio will look to continue their strong form at lowly Lecce and Sassuolo respectively.</p>
      <p>Roma have a chance to move into the Champions League places as the look to bounce back from last week’s defeat to Parma at home against tailenders Brescia.</p>
      <p>Carlo Ancelotti’s Serie A runners-up last season head for AC Milan amid reports he has two games left to save his job.</p>
      <p>Napoli have gone four games without a win in Serie A to sit seventh.</p>
      <p>The southerners have 19 points — 13 behind leaders Juventus — their worst tally after 12 games since the 2011-2012 season when they finished fifth.</p>
      <p>After being held 1-1 by Salzburg in the Champions League, they travel to Liverpool next week in a key game for the former Chelsea, AC Milan and Real Madrid boss.</p>
