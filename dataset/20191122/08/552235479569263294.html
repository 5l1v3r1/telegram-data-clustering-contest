      <h1>Lanark and Lesmahagow move up to West League 1 title contention spots</h1>
      <h2>Good wins at the weekend put both Lanarkshire sides level on points with leaders Shettleston.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Andy McGilvray, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/andy-mcgilvray/</a></address>
      <p>Lanark United and Lesmahagow both climbed four places in West League 1 with good away wins.</p>
      <p>That tucks United and ’Gow in second and third spot, respectively, on 25 points with leaders Shettleston, though the Glasgow side have FOUR games in hand over both.</p>
      <p>United beat Ardrossan Winton Rovers 4-1, while ’Gow returned from Stonehouse with a 2-0 win over Royal Albert.</p>
      <p>Bellshill Athletic fell down three places to fifth after losing 3-0 at Kello Rovers, and Larkhall Thistle moved down two spots to seventh, as Girvan ran out 3-2 winners.</p>
      <p>Albert’s defeat dropped them down to bottom of the pile, while Carluke Rovers bizarrely moved up a place on goal-difference, despite their match at Maryhill being postponed.</p>
      <p>Wishaw fell down a place after their match at home to Port Glasgow also fell foul of the weather.</p>
      <p>Lanark goalkeeper Gareth Hallford kept the scores level with a big save early on, and Joshua Gracie gave them the lead in 12 minutes, cutting into the box and beating three defenders before firing an unstoppable shot into the net.</p>
      <p>A minute later, good work from Kieran Brannan allowed him to set James Martin free on the left and he cut inside his marker before curling a shot past Ardrossan keeper Blair Lochhead for a 2-0 lead.</p>
      <p>Lanark stretched their lead to 3-0 in 30 minutes when Hugh Kerr found Brannan in the penalty area and his deft flick put the ball into the path of Gracie, who again beat his marker before firing home.</p>
      <p>Ardrossan started the second half well and pulled a goal back in 58 minutes when a long throw-in was headed out by Scott Nicol, but only as far as Rory Campbell, who blasted in a shot from the edge of the box.</p>
      <p>The hosts kept pushing for a second goal and it took a good block from Kerr after a corner to stop them.</p>
      <p>However, Lanark found their way back into the game and a ball down the right from Cammy Lawson found Brannan and he got into the box, but his shot was blocked for a corner.</p>
      <p>When the set-piece came in, the referee spotted an infringement and pointed to the spot, with Kerr sending the keeper the wrong way in 70 minutes.</p>
      <p>Kerr and Ian Watt were denied further goals for Lanark, but Hallford made the save of the game inside stoppage time, stopping a thunderous shot from Del Kennedy.</p>
      <p>Lesmahagow scored at either end of the game to clock up a 2-0 win at Royal Albert.</p>
      <p>Jason Thomson was the architect of the win, darting into the box and being fouled for a sixth-minute penalty that was scored by Kris Jarvie.</p>
      <p>Thomson then got the goal his play merited with five minutes left, with Albert finishing the game with 10 men late on.</p>
      <p>Two goals inside a minute weren’t enough for Larkhall Thistle to rescue a point, at home to Girvan.</p>
      <p>Girvan’s Kieran Balfour hit the post in four minutes, before Jack Currie had a shot blocked at the other end.</p>
      <p>The visitors took the lead in 11 minutes when a defensive blunder allowed Steven Currie the time and space to pick his spot.</p>
      <p>Thistle’s Shaun Gallagher had a shot blocked, and when the rebound fell to Scott Cowan, his shot was cleared off the line.</p>
      <p>At the other end Currie danced across the Larkhall defence before firing a shot just over.</p>
      <p>Larkhall started the second half well as they chased an equaliser, and Adam Boyle rattled the bar with a header early on.</p>
      <p>However, Girvan stepped things up and captain Craig Harvey forced two brilliant saves from Ryan Cooper, but netted at the third attempt in 68 minutes, curling an unstoppable shot into the top corner.</p>
      <p>More Girvan pressure followed, and Cooper made a good save from Harvey as the visitors threatened to run riot.</p>
      <p>Failure to take their chances came back to bite them, though, as Thistle staged a remarkable two-minute recovery.</p>
      <p>Jack Currie slipped his marker and got in behind the defence, picking out sub Taylor Scott, who rolled the ball into the corner.</p>
      <p>A minute later Taylor Scott played the ball down the left to Bartosz Mackiewicz, who drove the ball low into the box, and when it came back out, Mark Cuthbertson hit a fierce drive high into the net.</p>
      <p>Just as it looked like Thistle would earn a point, however, Girvan went on the attack again, with Cooper forced into a couple of good saves, before Currie tapped the ball in from close range after a shot had been blocked. It got worse for Jags as Dom Chiedu was sent off for a second booking just before the final whistle.</p>
