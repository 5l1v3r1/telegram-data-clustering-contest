      <h1>Tesco shoppers have compelling theory as to how Sainsbury's juice ended up on wrong store shelf</h1>
      <h2>The gaffe was spotted in a bargain hunters Facebook group</h2>

      <p>A Tesco shopper spotted a huge blunder in a store, as rival supermarket Sainsbury’s squash was spotted on the shelves.</p>
      <p>The error was spotted in a store in Lichfield by Demi Boonham, who posted a picture of the blunder in a popular bargain hunters' Facebook group.</p>
      <p>She posted the image with the caption “spot the error”.</p>
      <p>It is not clear how the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/22-things-tesco-sainsburys-staff-17112952">Sainsbury’s</a> own brand product came to be on the shelves at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/tesco-prices-through-roof-say-17266859">Britain's biggest grocer</a> - <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/huge-tesco-blunder-sainsburys-squash-17291142">reports Birmingham Live.</a></p>

      <p>But some eagle-eyed shoppers think the error proves that supermarkets stock identical products - with the manufacturer simply changing the label.</p>
      <p>One commenter said: “Just goes to show that some brands are actually the same.”</p>
      <p>Another said: "Can't wait to show my husband this, he swears he only likes the Tesco brand, brilliant haha,"</p>
      <p>A third said: "It took me way to long to see what was wrong in this picture."</p>
      <p>And a fourth wrote: "Awww. The poor lonely <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/sainsburys-praised-not-selling-fireworks-17104405">Sainsbury's</a> bottle."</p>
      <p>Another shopper wrote: “I got broccoli with a Sainsbury’s label on in Tesco the other day and the cashier thought I'd planted it.”</p>
      <p>While someone else said: "I got Morrison’s gluten free sausages in my Tesco delivery once."</p>
      <p>And another wrote: “I bought Sainsbury's milk in Aldi once before.”</p>
