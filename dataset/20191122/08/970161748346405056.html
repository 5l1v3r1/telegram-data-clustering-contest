      <h1>Yungblud review: Anthemic hits smash though Brixton Academy</h1>

      <p>Yungblud has managed to shoot to the forefront of rock music over the past 18 months with the kind of force that wouldn’t be unexpected from a juggernaut.</p>
      <p>As the singer’s UK tour hits London’s iconic Brixton Academy, it becomes evidently clear why – Dominic Harrison has a kind of relentless, infectious energy you can’t ignore even if you wanted to.</p>
      <p>In the space of an album and his newly released EP, he’s managed to create anthem after anthem, and they’re all on full display as he heads to the stage waving a flag as smudged lipstick covers a beaming grin.</p>
      <p>Kicking off with 21st Century Liability, Yungblud careers through his tracks as the audience belts along to every word.</p>
      <p>At one point, he could have easily left the stage and the song could have carried on regardless as he storms through Parents and I Love You, Will You Marry Me, with each track varying through emo, to rock, to ska and back again.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>There’s a lot of care that goes into Yungblud’s unique relationship to his fans and the world he’s created around him. Perhaps this is most evident before his set even begins, with supporting act Saint Phnx stopping the entire show in its tracks as a member of the crowd passes out in the heat.</p>

      <p>The message is clear before they even say it: ‘Take care of each other and help each other out.’ It’s repeated throughout the entire show.</p>
      <p>Halfway through the set, the star risks heading into the middle of the audience, smack bang in the middle of the moshpit, with a guitar and a microphone, to perform Kill Somebody – and then trusts that they won’t tear him apart.</p>
      <p>They don’t. They’re not here for that.</p>
      <p>It’s a bit of a testament to him that he manages to turn the 5000 capacity venue from feeling like a tiny record store gig to something worthy of a stadium from one song to the next, heading back onto the stage for his anthemic I Think I’m OKAY, which despite the absence of Machine Gun Kelly, still works.</p>

      <p>In another, he tells everyone to hug the people beside him, and declares the event as a display of whoever they want to be – which is literal music to an angst-ridden era’s ears when everything else they’re told seems to be negative.</p>

      <p>Then he later segues into Brexit and Boris Johnson (who was offered a ticket on Twitter but for some strange reason didn’t turn up).</p>
      <p>In the blink of an eye, the show’s set has not only finished, but overrun, and Dominic, still managing to seem like a kid who’s just been given a hell of a lot of e-numbers, then sticks around to meet anyone who wants to meet him.</p>

      <p>It takes some stamina but you can tell he’s enjoying every part of the monumental moment.</p>
      <p>It’s derivative cliche to say that Yungblud is the voice of a generation, but the implications are there as an audience full of p***ed off people break away to feel like they’re a united force for something greater.</p>
      <p>…So let’s just say here may be hope for the underrated youth just yet.</p>
