        <b>CSB Bank IPO: CSB Bank Outlook and Valuations:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The bank is its first phase of performance has done reasonably well. It has reduced the influence of unions and religious institution, rationalizing branches/employees and turning it from a capital-starved bank into a capital-excess bank after onboarding investor-cum-promoter Fairfax, <i>NDTV</i> quoted Mumbai-based brokerage firm Emkay as saying.</p>
      <p>The second phase of the journey is being said to be challenging.</p>
