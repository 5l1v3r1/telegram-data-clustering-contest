        <b>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has arrived in Kolkata to watch the first day-night Test match between India and Bangladesh at the invitation of her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A special flight of Biman Bangladesh Airlines carrying the prime minister and her entourage took off from Shahjalal International Airport at 10:15 am on Friday.</p>
      <p>It landed at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport Kolkata at 10:25 am (Indian time).</p>
      <p>Mayor of Kolkata Firhad Hakim, Bangladeshi High Commissioner in India Syed Muazzem Ali and president of India's cricket board Sourav Ganguly received her at the airport.</p>
      <p>After the ceremonial events at the airport, Hasina will go to Hotel Taj Bengal Kolkata where she will be staying during her brief visit.</p>
      <p>The pink-ball Test is scheduled to start at 1:30 pm at the iconic Eden Gardens stadium.</p>
      <p>The Bangladesh leader along with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is set to ring the bell to start the Test match around 12:30pm (local time). However, Modi will not be able to attend the event due to a prior commitment.</p>
      <p>After watching the first session of the second and final Test of the series, the prime minister will return to her hotel.</p>
      <p>At the end of the first day's play, she will attend a cultural event organised by the Cricket Association of Bengal at the stadium ground.</p>
      <p>Hasina will leave Kolkata by a special Biman flight at 10pm (local time) and land at the Dhaka airport at 11:30pm (Bangladesh time).</p>
      <p>Bangladesh are currently trailing 1-0 in the two-Test series -- their first on Indian soil -- after a crushing defeat to the hosts in Indore.</p>
