        <b>Harry Cobden is feeling positive ahead of Cyrname’s monster clash with Altior in the Christy 1965 Chase at Ascot on Saturday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The two highest rated chasers go head to head in what will be their first run of the season.</p>
      <p>Cobden, who is an ambassador for Great British Racing, said: “The build-up has been brilliant. The much talked about clash between the two highest-rated chasers in the business has materialised and I really can't wait for Saturday.</p>
      <p>"I've been lucky enough to be involved in a few big races in my short career but this one is right up there.”</p>

      <p>Discussing Cyrname’s form, the 21-year-old said: “For Cyrname it's another day at the office and he seems in great form at home and ready to get on with the job. I schooled him two weeks ago and his regular work rider couldn't be happier with him. Everything is good our end, we're ready. It's our first run of the season and I’m obviously really excited for it.</p>
      <p>"In terms of tactics, I’d say we'd be silly to change anything. His style is very much to make the running, he tries to gallop his rivals into the ground. If someone wants to go fast, we’ll let them but looking at the race I don’t think anything will take us on.</p>
      <p>"I suppose Altior will just sit behind us and have a go at us in the straight. Cyrname is very good around Ascot having won his last two races over the same distance as the Christy Chase so that's a good sign for us. He's a great jumper and he showed that ability last time out in the Ascot Chase."</p>
      <p>Altior is searching for his 20th successive victory after becoming the first horse to win 19 consecutive jump races when securing the bet365 Celebration Chase at Sandown in April.</p>
      <p>On Altior, Cobden said: “You can’t take anything away from Altior, he’s been very good for a long time. I’ve followed him round in quite a few of his starts now. People say Altior might jump slightly left which probably isn't ideal for the right-handed Ascot, but when he did jump left round Ascot, he was doing all the work himself from the front, I’d say he'll jump fairly straight.</p>
      <p>"Altior, over two miles, is the best I’ve ever seen in my short career.</p>
      <p>"He’s stepping up to two and a half miles so they obviously think he will improve for the trip. If he does improve, he’ll be really difficult to beat. Both horses will be going there in top form and I’m just looking forward to it.</p>
      <p>"Looking at the weather, there might be some rain which is a good sign. Soft ground is ideal for us but to be honest he acts on anything. I think Altior is in the same boat too so there'll be no excuses about the ground."</p>
      <p>Cobden, who has secured 36 wins so far this season and sits eighth in the 2019/20 Jump Jockeys’ Championship, could have a difficult choice on his hands if Cyrname was to be victorious on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He said: “If Cyrname wins on Saturday, he'll go straight to the Ladbrokes King George VI Chase and Clan Des Obeaux will go there as well. I’ll then have a tough decision on what horse I’m going to ride! Not a bad position to be in so I'll worry about that if it happens.”</p>
      <p>The Somerset based jockey continued: “To be involved in a big battle between two top horses is very exciting. When I was growing up I remember watching battles between Kauto Star and Denman thinking one day it would be great to involved in something like that.</p>
      <p>"Denman and Kauto Star were involved in some of the best races that we’ll ever have to see. I was a big Ruby and Kauto fan as a kid. When Kauto Star's second Gold Cup victory will live long in the memory.</p>
      <p>"An unbelievable horse trained so masterfully by the boss Paul Nicholls. I suppose Cyrname and Altior will probably be one of the biggest races we’ll see this year. To be honest I’m delighted to be part of it.</p>
      <p>"I'm extremely grateful to be in the position to ride one of the best horses in the country on a big day at Ascot - Roll on Saturday."</p>
