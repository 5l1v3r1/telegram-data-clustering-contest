      <h1>Mnangagwa spites Robert and Grace Mugabe</h1>

      <p>MDC Youth official Discent Collins Bajila says President Emmerson Mnangagwa used the renaming of the roads around Zimbabwe to mock the memory of the President Robert Mugabe and his widow Grace Ntombizodwa Mugabe. <br/><br/>Said Bajila, "Those of us who herded cattle will remember some competition of showing off whose urine can shoot the longest. We stood in single file and shot urine. Whoever shot the longest was the winner. There was no prize though. Just a show of meaningless force.  This is the game behind renaming of streets. We all know that in terms of transport infrastructure, the renaming has no meaningful effect. What was needed was revamping not renaming."<br/><br/>Bajila said Mnangagwa's cabinet has named the road that passes in front on Mugabe's home with his own name and renamed Harare hospital in honour of the late First Lady Sally Mugabe to spite the Mugabes. <br/><br/>"The spiteful politics behind this act is as follows; <br/><br/>1) to spite the Mugabes for refusing with Robert Mugabe's corpse, Chinhoyi-Chegutu Road has been named Emerson Mnangagwa Road. This road drives past Mugabes Murombedzi rural area. <br/><br/>2) to spite Grace Mugabe personally, Harare Hospital has been renamed Sally Mugabe. <br/><br/>3) to spite the Street Naming Committees of various Local Authorities, whose mandate is to rename streets, their duty has been illegally usurped paving way for disputes between local and national government. This dispute is set to be a serious side show which will divert attention from economic debates to names debates. Without proper tact from Local Authorities, July Moyo will be ready to dissolve and fire. It's an interesting game of chess which need proper thought not knee-jerk reactions."<br/><br/> There has been a public outcry from people of Bulawayo over the naming of 6th Avenue after Mnangagwa.</p>
