      <p>Two-time Olympic bronze medallist Paddy Barnes has hung up his gloves by announcing his retirement from boxing with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>The North Belfast fighter has called time on his professional career, following three defeats in his last four fights.</p>
      <p>His last face off in October saw a crushing defeat at the hands of Welshman Jay Harris. Barnes failed to win in a flyweight bout at the Ulster Hall.</p>
      <p>The boxer had a distinguished career as an amateur, representing Ireland at three Olympic Games, winning medals at light-flyweight in Beijing and London.</p>
      <p>He won gold medals during the 2010 and 2014 Commonwealth Games, while competing for Northern Ireland.</p>

      <p>The 32-year-old announced his retirement on Twitter and retires with a professional record of six wins and three defeats throughout the time span of his career.</p>
      <p>In a statement Barnes said:</p>
      <p>"After taking some time I've came to a decision to retire. I've had a great career and achieved so much.</p>
      <p>"I have loved every minute of boxing, it has been my life for the past 21 years. I have achieved my dream of becoming an Olympian and getting to carry the Irish flag at the Olympic Games opening ceremony. Those moments were the proudest of my career.</p>
      <p>"Professional boxing was never a dream of mine but I tried and threw myself into the deep end straight away. It didn't work out but I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
      <p>"I'd like to thank my family for supporting me throughout my entire career, my wife Mari for keeping my feet firmly on the ground and helping me towards my goals.</p>
      <p>"I want to thank my parents Jimmy Linden, Gerry Storey, Seamy McCann and everyone at the Holy Family boxing club.</p>
      <p>"Also the HP coaches John Conlan, Zauri Antia, Billy Walsh and Eddie Bolger. I would also like to thank my professional coach Danny Vaughan who has been great to me."</p>
