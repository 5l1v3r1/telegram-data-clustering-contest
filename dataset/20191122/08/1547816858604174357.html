      <p>First, the 64-million dollar question: What was going on? Second, the million-dollar question: Did the producers (T-Series and Anand Pandit) not realise at any point that what was being made needed to be stopped? What a waste of time, money and resources-actually, quite a distinct feature in almost every sphere of life with the kind of mediocrity that has set in around us. </p>

      <p>All the blame to Anees Bazmee who seems to make repititive stuff but one that is declining in quality with most films after Ready. Play on your strengths sir,  but don't become a victim of ditching quality for quantity. I can't understand why Anil Kapoor of all the people had to say 'yes' to you for this one. Mr India, who s loved by almost one and all, is such an intelligent man that I refuse to believe that the film you've made is exactly the one that you spelt out to him. </p>

      <p>John Abraham has come so much into his own nowadays that even his films which haven't created a big buzz before release have had people respecting him and his work. I am not ready to buy the line  that the actor in question wanted to do something different and hence committed a harakiri with you, Anees sir. </p>

      <p>Bazmee sir, please explain what you have made. God knows, what Abracadabra you did while rolling it out for them on the narration table that Anil snd John both got trapped in this.</p>
      <p>And now for the packaged lovers Kriti Kharbanda and Pulkit Samrat. Absolutely no chemistry, terribly awkward- and mind you, I am modestly saying that.</p>

      <p>Ileana D'cruz is definitely one role that was not even required, she's there perhaps to let Abraham have a heroine opposite him.</p>

      <p>And uff, just in case you have got disconnected-waise there's nothing to hold your attention-getting in comes a bhutni wearing the shortest of shorts and desperate to kiss Arshad Warsi, for whom my heart bleeds when I see that one of the better actors like him has been reduced to making faces in a jhund in most films he does.</p>

      <p>And decipher this as I leave you: Gates closing, crackers flying, Saurav Shukla ducking for cover, Papa Saurav telling Kriti she told him she has kissed Pulkit 4000 times and after 2 hours, Kriti not letting Pulkit kiss saying Papa told her that a kiss will make you pregnant. Did you? I didn't. </p>

      <p>And the icing on the cake: Virat Kohli 99 pe khel raha tha aur Raj Kishore (Abraham's name in the mess) ke aane se woh out ho gaya! I am not bad at cricket but I would have certainly got out for a FIRST BALL DUCK if I had seen this ruckus, mess, whatever, few hours before taking strike.</p>
