      <p>India’s banking sector may witness a turnaround, after recent rule changes put <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/finance-news-banks-1030101.htm">banks </a>in a better position to get their money back from insolvent companies, according to Ridham Desai, managing director at <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/morgan-stanley">Morgan Stanley </a>India Co.</p>
      <p>A Supreme Court ruling last week not only paved the way for ArcelorMittal’s purchase of Essar Steel India Ltd., an Indian steel mill, but also allowed <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/finance-news-banks-1030101.htm">banks </a>to set the terms of the distribution of sale proceeds among creditors. The move to empower <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/finance-news-banks-1030101.htm">banks </a>“has settled several disputes” around India’s bankruptcy law introduced in 2016, Desai said at a conference in Singapore on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“Last week’s judgment may well prove to be an inflection point for the sector,” Desai said, adding that banks previously were not well-placed to recover loans. “I would be fairly optimistic of the banking sector in India.”</p>
      <p>Indian lenders, which are saddled with some of the world’s worst bad-loan ratios, are expected to get a boost from increased regulatory oversight of the shadow banking sector as well, he added. The government last week introduced rules to help creditors recover loans due from large shadow lenders.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, authorities have also stepped up surveillance of non-banking financial companies of late, seizing control of another institution, Dewan Housing <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/finance">Finance </a>Corp., which has total debt of about $12.5 billion.</p>
      <p>The Mumbai-based analyst is overweight financials by two percentage points versus the MSCI India Index, with a preference for seven financial firms including HDFC Bank Ltd. and ICICI Bank Ltd. The NSE Nifty Bank Index, a gauge of the most liquid and large-cap banking stocks in the country, has risen 15% this year and is near a record high.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the government’s planned capital injection into public sector banks, which account for 65% of the industry, is “the biggest cyclical fix” that will support the sector, according to Desai. In August, the Indian government announced a series of state-bank mergers and a capital injection of 552.5 billion rupees ($7.7 billion) -- its most sweeping bank overhaul in decades -- in a bid to revive the economy.</p>
      <p>“You should see signs of a new credit cycle in the next 12 months,” Desai said.</p>
