      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/lili-reinhart">Lili Reinhart</a> has defended comments she made during an appearance on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/the-tonight-show-starring-jimmy-fallon"><i>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i></a> about having <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/">obsessive compulsive disorder</a> (OCD) – a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/MentalHealth">mental health</a> condition in which a person has obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours.</p>
      <p>Last week, the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/riverdale"><i>Riverdale</i></a> actor appeared on the chat show and discussed scenes from the film <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/hustlers"><i>Hustlers</i></a>, in which her character reacts to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Stress">stress</a> by vomiting.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old spoke about how the scenes came to life and revealed that the vomit was actually a mixture of animal crackers and Sprite.  </p>
      <p>“I thought I was going to have a problem here because I have this really, like, OCD thing with floaters in water and drinks,” Reinhart said.</p>
      <p>“Like, if my drink has a little floater in it, I’m like [gags], get it out. That’s when I want to throw up! </p>
      <p>“So, having basically a cup of something that looked like ‘floaters’ in water was like my worst nightmare.”</p>
      <p>The actor was later criticised on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/SocialMedia">social media</a> for mentioning OCD, with some <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Twitter">Twitter</a> users accusing her of exploiting the stereotypes associated with the condition.</p>
      <p>“People never take my ocd seriously. That’s because everyone claims to have it,” one person wrote.</p>
      <p>Following the backlash, Reinhart has now defended her comments and confirmed that she does really have OCD.</p>
      <p>“I just want to put out there re: my Fallon interview— I actually do suffer from OCD, it wasn’t just a little quip I made on a talk show,” she tweeted.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had OCD since I was in elementary school. So, yes. I do have the right to talk about it. Thanks.”</p>
      <p>In response to her tweet, a number of fans have praised the star for being so honest and helping to shine a spotlight on the condition. </p>
      <p>“I’ve had OCD my entire life. I’ve even been hospitalised for it. The fact that you feel comfortable talking about it is inspiring for me. Thank you for being you!” one person commented.</p>
      <p>Another added: “Mental illnesses are an endless struggle, I appreciate you talking about them SO MUCH. You’re an absolute legend.”</p>
      <p>A third person wrote: “You are one brave, honest and naturally beautiful person. </p>
      <p>“I have heard you speak on body dysmorphia, mental illness and now OCD. You are my hero. Keep talking, people are listening. Thank you for speaking for those of us without the platform to make an impact.”</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time Reinhart has spoken publicly about her personal struggles. </p>
      <p>In February, the actor shared that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/lili-reinhart-therapy-mental-health-ashamed-instagram-a8784451.html">she was starting therapy again</a> for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Anxiety">anxiety</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/depression">depression</a>, which she was diagnosed with at age 14.</p>
      <p>“Friendly reminder for anyone who needs to hear it: Therapy is never something to feel ashamed of,” she posted on her Instagram Story. </p>
