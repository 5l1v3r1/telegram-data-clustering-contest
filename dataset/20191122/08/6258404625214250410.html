      <p>Well, this is definitely... <i>interesting</i>. Tesla CEO Elon Musk finally pulled the wraps off the <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/elon-musk-blade-runner-cybertruck-tesla-electric-pickup-nov-21">highly anticipated Cybertruck EV</a>, and it's definitely a different look for the pickup segment. While the <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/rivian-r1t-all-electric-pickup-boasts-750-horsepower-400-mile-range">Rivian R1T</a> takes a [mostly] conventional approach with its looks, the Cybertruck looks like no other truck on the road with its wedge shape.</p>
      <p><a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a> said that inspiration came from the classic Lotus Esprit mid-engine sports car, and we definitely get that vibe. The looks are definitely polarizing and owe nothing to the more organically-shaped <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/model-s">Model S</a>, <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/model-x">Model X</a>, and <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/model-3">Model 3</a> that came before it. Despite its looks, the <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/cybertruck">Cybertruck</a> is roughly the same size as the best-selling <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/ford">Ford</a> F-150 and can seat up to six people. It has a 6.5-foot bed, will carry a load of up to 3,500 pounds, and has ground clearance of up to 16 inches.</p>

      <p>Getting down to the all-important details surrounding the powertrain, there are three versions that will be made available. The base configuration includes a single rear motor, 250+ mile range, can run 0-60 in 6.5 seconds, and has a towing capacity of 7,500+ pounds. The mid-level configuration includes dual motors (AWD), a 300+ mile range, can hit 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, and features a towing capacity of 10,000+ pounds.</p>

      <p>The most potent version, however, throws in triple motors and will be able to sprint from a standstill to 60 mph in less than 2.9 seconds. This configuration also of course includes AWD, will go 500+ miles per charge, and can tow 14,000+ pounds.</p>

      <p>Surprisingly, the Cybertruck, which features a unibody construction unlike most other trucks on the road (with the only other exception being the Honda Ridgeline), will have a base price of just $39,990 for the RWD model. The dual-motor configuration bumps that price to $49,990, while the top-level triple-motor spec will start at $69,990. Considering how expensive full-size trucks are these days (trying pricing a flagship F-150 King Ranch), those prices seem to be quite competitive.</p>
      <p><a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/tesla">Tesla</a> says that production of the Cybertruck will commence in late 2021, and the company is currently accepting preorders with a $100 refundable deposit.</p>
