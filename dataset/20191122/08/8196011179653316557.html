      <p>Plans are being drawn up for new Direct Provision centres with space for 5,500 asylum seekers.</p>
      <p>The Government is promising to engage with local communities about the proposed accommodation.</p>
      <p>So far this year, more than 3,700 people have applied for asylum in Ireland, the highest number in over a decade which has put pressure on the Government to find enough accommodation for them.</p>
      <p>According to the Irish Times, the Department of Justice is looking for providers to operate the new Direct Provision centres.</p>
      <p>They will be located in eight regions and cost at least â‚¬320m.</p>
      <p>Kildare, Wicklow, Meath and Louth will be expected to house 1,200 people followed by 750 in Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan and Sligo.</p>
      <p>There will be accommodation for 620 people in Dublin and 617 in Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.</p>
      <p>The department is also promising to engage with locals following recent protests against plans for Direct Provision facilities.</p>
