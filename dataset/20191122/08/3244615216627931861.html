"The new [Swift-focused] <a href="https://www.apple.com/education/teaching-code/">Everyone Can Code curriculum</a>," explains the Apple Newsroom, "integrates Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/education/everyone-can-create/">Everyone Can Create</a> project guides to help students express what they learn through drawing, music, video and photos." And it appears that Tim Cook may no longer be content with waiting until kids are in 4th grade before <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/16/05/28/1945217/apple-ceo-tim-cook-id-require-all-children-to-start-coding-in-4th-grade">requiring them to start coding</a>. From the press release: "Preschool-age kids can try creative pre-coding activities in the new Coding Lab with <a href="https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/19/04/06/2259235/apple-tv-includes-a-muppet-who-codes">the Helpsters</a>, a team of vibrant monsters who love to solve problems and are featured in the new live-action preschool series, available now on Apple TV+, from the makers of Sesame Street." <a href="https://www.apple.com/today/event/coding-lab-helpsters-092919/">Today at Apple adds</a>: "Kids aged 3 to 5 will get hands-on with iPad and Apple Pencil to learn fun precoding activities that teach them how to solve everyday problems like finding a shoe or helping their parents."</i></p>
