      <p>A woman has transformed her sofa and revealed how she made it look completely new.</p>
      <p>The woman said her 'shabby' sofa was worn and diffcult to clean but decided to sew a new cover for the sofa and cushions.</p>
      <p>She gave the sofa a new lease of life, she decided to replace the brown leather look with grey material she bought for Â£19.99 a metre.</p>
      <p>Sharing before and after pictures on the Facebook group ' <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/498790373919777/?ref=group_header">We Love Mrs Hinch</a> ', others loved the 'fab' transformation.</p>
      <p>She explained she began by deconstructing the sofa, removing the cushions to find all the seams and work out how it was originally made, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/mrs-hinch-fan-shares-how-20924391">reports the Mirror.</a></p>

      <p>Next, she made a paper pattern for each section of the covers, measuring them to size and recreating the shape out of the new material.</p>
      <p>The shapes were then pinned onto the sofa to ensure it fully covered each surface and fit together.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "Ensure you have a seam allowance. Cut out, draw around the line where you need to sew.</p>
      <p>"Pin together. Sew with running stitch on machine."</p>
      <p>She made the covers for the arms first, before tackling the cushions, using a thin later of wadding underneath to hide the lines of the old leather.</p>
      <p>Cheaper fabric was used for the underside of the cushions and she referred to a YouTube tutorial to help her perfect the pipping.</p>
      <p>The end result was stunning, with one person replying: "As a fellow sewer I want to say that is flipping amazing!! You must be so chuffed with it."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Wow what a difference. It looks like a completely new sofa. Well done you. Looks fab."</p>
