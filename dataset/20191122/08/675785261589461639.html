      <h1>'Thousands' of TSB Bank customers not paid wages forcing bank to issue emergency funds</h1>
      <h2>A TSB banking error has meant customers have been locked out of their wages - with one reader left heartbroken after waking up to find out she cannot pay for the deposit on her flat</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:47:30+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:47</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Munbodh, https://www.facebook.com/EmmaMunbodh</a></address>
      <p>Thousands of TSB customers have been left without access to their wages, after the bank's systems crashed overnight.</p>
      <p>Customers have taken to social media to claim they have not been paid - with earnings, benefits, pensions and other payments still outstanding.</p>
      <p>Mirror reader Kerry Louise said she's been unable to pay for a deposit on a flat this morning, waking up to "nothing" on the day her £900 payment is due.</p>
      <p>"I was expecting my wages this morning and woke up with nothing. I have an appointment before work to put a deposit down for a flat and now cannot do this.</p>
      <p>"TSB have ruined everything. I am heartbroken. There's been no explanation, no time limit or anything. This is happening too often and I will be changing banks after this. I cannot believe it," the customer explained.</p>
      <p>Another reader told us his wages haven't appeared, despite being issued by his employer, causing an "absolute nightmare".</p>
      <p>It comes just days after a damning report by law firm Slaughter and May criticised TSB's board for lacking "common sense" in the lead-up to last year's IT calamity after a systems upgrade went spectacularly wrong.</p>

      <p>A TSB statement on Friday, said the bank is experiencing some "delays".</p>
      <p>"Some payments into TSB accounts have been delayed overnight and we are working to process these as soon as possible today.</p>
      <p>"We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and will ensure customers are not left out of pocket."</p>
      <p>If you've incurred any extra costs due to today's outage, keep hold of any receipts, call logs and invoices which you can use to make a claim once the issue has been resolved.</p>

      <p>The bank said that customers' cards are still working for payments and withdrawals, and that those who need emergency cash can get in touch using the number on the back of their cards.</p>
      <p>"If TSB customers need emergency cash or have any questions they can visit us in branch or contact us via the number on the back of their card," a statement added.</p>
      <p>"Customers can still use their cards to make payments or withdraw cash."</p>

      <p>The latest error follows the lender's IT meltdown last April which left 1.9 million people unable to access their money - some for weeks.</p>
      <p>In the months that followed, customers flocked away from the bank which lost 10 customers for every one gained.</p>
      <p>The outage first occurred when TSB's systems were due to be transferred over from Lloyds computers to a new TSB database.</p>
      <p>The bank had said that some of its services, including online banking, making payments or transferring money, would be down for the April weekend.</p>
      <p>However the problems persisted for six weeks - and went well beyond those predicted.</p>
      <p>It later transpired that some people had been given access to other customers' accounts - with at least one person seeing an available balance of more than £20,000 and another reportedly being credited with £13,000 after logging back in.</p>
      <p>Shortly after, the bank's boss, Paul Pester, gave up his £2million bonus in front of a committee of MPs, and resigned.</p>
      <p>TSB later said it suffered a statutory pre-tax loss of £105.4 million in 2018 on the back of the blunder.</p>
      <p>The bank said the disastrous meltdown of its IT system resulted in £330.2million of costs, linked to customer compensation, additional resources and fraud.</p>
      <p>In total, 80,000 customers switched their bank account away from TSB in 2018 - 30,000 more than 2017.</p>
      <p>The bank's new chief executive Debbie Crosbie is due to update on her strategy overhaul at TSB on November 25.</p>
