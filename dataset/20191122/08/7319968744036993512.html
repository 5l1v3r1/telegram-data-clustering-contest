        <b>Eccentric Kerry politician Michael Healy-Rae told a tale of Tom Cruise in 1991 when he almost got into a real-life fight for stepping over the line in a local pub.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was a long, long time ago that Tom Cruise descended on County Kerry with his then-wife Nicole Kidman to make their “Irish” movie "Far and Away" – 1991 to be exact – and the locals are still yapping away about it.</p>
      <p>Well, at least one person is – the Kerry politician <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/news/politics/irish-politician-people-who-dont-eat-meat-have-never-worked-hard">Michael Healy-Rae</a>, who told the Irish radio show hosted by Pat Kenny on Tuesday that Cruise’s on-screen fisticuffs nearly came to real-life during one incident in a local pub, the Loo Bridge Bar outside of Kilgarvan, not far from where the film was shooting.</p>
      <p>According to Healy-Rae, some local named Ger the Manny – yep, Ger the Manny! – didn’t take kindly to TC reaching over the bar to grab some extra ice for his Diet Coke.</p>

      </p>
      <p>We’ll let him take it from there: "He was an elderly man and he had his stick up on the counter and he was sipping away at a little glass of Guinness.</p>
      <p>"Ger jumped up off his stool, he caught his stick and drew a belt at yer man’s hand trying to hit him across the hand.  But he just missed and there was a big bang down on the counter right near the Yank’s hand. </p>
      <p>“Cruise shouted, ‘My goodness I was just leaning in to get a bit more ice.’</p>
      <p>"Ger the Manny shouted out, ‘You b*****d you were trying to steal Matt’s fags.’”</p>
      <p>Fags, of course, are cigarettes in Irish slang.  And not surprisingly, Tom and Nicole finished their drinks pretty quickly and scattered!</p>
