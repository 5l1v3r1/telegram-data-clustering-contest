      <p>Ahmad Lawan has said the Senate does not have any request to confirm the acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Ibrahim Magu.</p>
      <p>Concise News understands that the 8th Senate on March 15, 2017, turned down the nomination of Ibrahim Magu as the substantive chairman of the EFCC over security reports against him.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Thursday when the Chairman, Presidential Advisory Committee on Anti-Corruption (PACAC) Itse Sagay visited him at the National Assembly Complex, Abuja, Lawan noted that there should be a new request for Magu’s confirmation.</p>
      <p>“I want to assure you that any request that comes from Mr President is a request that will make Nigeria a better place in terms of appointments or legislation,” he said.</p>
      <p>“And the Senate will act expeditiously to ensure that we play our part in the confirmation or passing of legislation appropriately.</p>
      <p>“You have talked about the passage of anti-corruption bills, you have come to the right place but you will also do your work.</p>
      <p>“This is a new Senate. Going by our rules and I believe that goes for the House of Representatives too, any issue that was not concluded in the last National Assembly will have to start all over again.</p>
      <p>“So, as far as we are concerned, those bills will have to come again and start to go through the process from the very beginning.</p>
      <p>“We are ready, in fact, we are in haste if those bills are ready for us to start working on them.”</p>
      <p>On his part, Sagay said Magu had done well and deserves to be made the substantive chairman of the anti-corruption body.</p>
      <p>“We also want to bring before the Senate, some of the criticisms of the public in the area of oversight,” he added.</p>
      <p>“There is this constant complaint that members of committees demand some form of gratification before they would visit a place or write anything favourable about the ministries, departments and agencies.</p>
      <p>“We appeal to the leadership to look into it and ensure that the oversight work of the Senate does not involve anything that will be described as extortion.”</p>
