      <p>Crooner Jose Mari Chan and his undying ballad “Christmas In Our Hearts” song are two holiday staples that this country <a href="https://coconuts.co/manila/news/jose-mari-chan-trending-ph/">knows <i>all</i><i> too well.</i></a></p>
      <p>So well, in fact, that Spotify has just dropped a reboot of Chan’s other Christmas classic “A Perfect Christmas,” this time as an all-star seven-act extravaganza that is being touted as the first Asian-made holiday single.</p>

      <p>The reboot of Chan’s 1990 Christmas classic features a nearly <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/1aifvRID8WVENI4KDyCx27">five-minute track</a> featuring an all-Filipino line-up with Chan, the groups Ben &amp; Ben, December Avenue, and I Belong to the Zoo, and the singers Julie Anne San Jose and Moira Dela Torre.</p>
      <p>The ballad picks up with Chan lyrically describing his idea of a perfect Christmas, with Dela Torre jumping to sing the succeeding verses in smooth trills, before the rest of the group piles on, one on top of the other, in a blissful, Christmas-y harmony.</p>
      <p>The single is the first track on Spotify’s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWU0rV6Im72pA?si=f7qEXAl-RlSfa-XtpthDxw">“Paskong Pinoy”</a> playlist.</p>
      <p>“When I recorded the track back in the ’90s, I never dreamed that it would become the quintessential Christmas song it is today; that it would be listened to year after year and loved by generations,” Chan said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“To me, the spirit of Christmas is being able to give and share your love and Christmas isn’t ‘perfect’ without someone special, someone you love.”</p>
      <p>Dela Torre added, “The song is close to my heart. It has always been one of my favorite Christmas songs and now it feels even more special to me.”</p>

      <p>Singer-songwriter (and businessman) Chan’s almost three-decade-old album <i>Christmas In Our Hearts </i>was released in 1990 and became <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/10/30/12/jose-mari-chan-launch-2nd-christmas-album">one of the biggest-selling-albums</a> in the Philippines. The 16-track album featured several original singles, including “A Perfect Christmas,” plus reinterpretations of Christmas classics.</p>
