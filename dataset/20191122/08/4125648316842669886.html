      <p>BEIRUT, LEBANON (11:40 A.M.) – The Russian Federation could supply the Islamic Republic of Iran with their S-400 air defense system as early as next year, the Russian publication Nezavisimaya Gazeta said in a report this week.</p>
      <p>“The Russian Federation and China can become the main exporters of advanced weapons to Iran after the country leaves the arms embargo,” Nezavisimaya Gazeta began.</p>
      <p>“The Pentagon shares many concerns. Experts draw attention to the difficulties that Iran may face in acquiring the latest technology. Iran, as the US military notes, is interested in Su-30 multipurpose fighters, Yak-130 combat trainers and T-90 tanks. S-400 systems, as well as Bastion coastal missile systems, may become an acquisition,” they added.</p>
      <p>According to the Russian publication <a href="http://avia.pro/news/rossiya-nachnyot-postavku-iranu-s-400-uzhe-v-sleduyushchem-godu">Avia.Pro</a>, as soon as the UN sanctions are lifted from Iran, a corresponding agreement will be concluded between Russia and Iran, and within a couple of weeks, such weapons will be transferred to the army of the Islamic Republic, and, obviously, this is precisely what the U.S. fears.</p>
      <p>Neither Iran nor Russia has recently commented on this claim, but if true, this would be a major boost to Iran’s air defenses, as they currently have the Russian-made S-300.</p>
