      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/u2">U2</a> have teamed up with AR Rahman on new track ‘Ahimsa’, ahead of playing their first ever show in India.</p>
      <p>The track is the first new offering from the Irish rock icons since 2017’s ‘Songs of Innocence’ and it sees the band heading in an increasingly spiritual direction.</p>
      <p><i>“This is an invitation/to a high location/For someone who wants to belong,”</i> Bono sings on the track. <i>“This is a meditation/On your radio station/If you like it you can sing along/Ahimsa.”</i></p>
      <p>In an interview with<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/u2-ahimsa-song-lyric-video-916356/"> Rolling Stone</a>, Jai Ho composer Rahman explained that the track was all about the eponymous concept of non-violence.</p>

      <p>“The concept of ‘ahimsa’ or non-violence — it’s Indian, it’s South Asian, it’s Buddhist… and sometimes we have to remind people about love, about ahimsa,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It takes a lot of courage to be non-violent. It takes a lot of power. It’s not a weakness, it’s more power than showing might; it’s going beyond that, believing in something else which is not present… something that’s only in your spirit.”</p>
      <p>It comes as U2 continue their New Zealand ‘Joshua Tree’ tour – which sees the band performing their seminal 1987 album in full.</p>
      <p>In July, U2 fans also unearthed <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/u2-fans-discover-oldest-known-recording-of-band-2523457">what is believed to be the oldest recording from one of the band’s earliest live shows.</a></p>
