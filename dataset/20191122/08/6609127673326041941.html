      <h4>Our tips for finding the best deals this Black Friday</h4>
      <p>
        <b>IT might be tempting to dive in and snap up LOADS of items on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but here’s how you can guarantee you’re getting a good deal.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>PREPARE</b> Research the items you want to buy and find out the cheapest price. Websites like PriceSpy, PriceHistory and CamelCamelCamel will give you historical data on prices so you can see how much you should pay.</p>
      <p><b>GET FOLLOWING </b>Follow your favourite shops on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and sign up to its deals newsletter to get the latest on any offers. We post the best deals in our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheSunMoney/">Sun Money FB group</a> too.</p>
      <p><b>EARN CASHBACK</b> Check websites like Quidco and TopCashback BEFORE you place your order. Cashback websites PAY you to shop. All you have to do is click through their links and the money is added to your online account, usually within 14 days.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for other offers, check out our Black Friday page, where you'll be able to find the key areas likely to feature in the event.</p>
      <p>Shoppers can also get in early as some high street shops have already launched their sales, with up to 60 per cent off goods.</p>
