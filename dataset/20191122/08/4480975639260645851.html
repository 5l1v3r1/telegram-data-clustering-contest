      <p>The German manufacturing sector contraction slowed in November, the preliminary manufacturing activity report from IHS/Markit research showed this Friday.</p>
      <p>The German Manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) arrived at 43.8 versus 42.9 expected and 42.1 previous, hitting five-month highs.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, services <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">PMI</a> hit a 38-month low level of 51.3 as against previous months reading of 52.0 and 51.6 anticipated.</p>
      <p>The IHS Markit Flash Germany Composite Output Index came in at three-month highs of 49.2 in November vs. October’s 48.9 and 49.4 expectations. </p>
      <h3>Key comments from Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit:</h3>
      <p>“Beneath the subdued headline numbers the data show another slight convergence between the more domestically-focussed service sector and export-led manufacturing.”</p>
      <p>“While still showing a degree of resilience, the service sector is growing only modestly and at its slowest rate for over three years. By contrast, manufacturing remains firmly in contraction, but many of the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> here are at least moving in the right direction and it would seem the worst of the downturn is over barring any shocks.”</p>
      <p>On mixed German PMI numbers, the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">EUR/USD</a> pair popped to 1.1085 highs before reverting to the familiar region around 1.1070 levels.</p>
