      <h1>Warframe Rising Tide Update is coming soon to the PC, key features detailed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:24:14+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:24</time> by <a rel="author">John Papadopoulos</a></address>
      <p>Digital Extremes has announced that the newest Warframe Rising Tide update will be coming soon to PC. As such, Tenno will embark on an epic quest to ready their personal Railjack battleship for harrowing, cooperative space combat when Empyrean launches later this year.</p>
      <p>Players can work with their clan members – or as a clan of one – to build the Dry Dock; an all-in-one workshop and garage for the Railjack. After Tenno assembles the Dry Dock, they will have to recruit the reluctant help of A.I., Cephalon Cy, to scour the Origin System for lost Railjack technology to construct the ultimate battleship. And once Empyrean launches, the Railjack can be customized in between missions with new weapons, parts and mods.</p>
      <p>This update also features the first steps to the Liset that will prepare it for Empyrean. The Rising Tide update will overhaul select visual aspects of your personal landing craft, adding in updated machines and enhanced lighting. It will also add a new “moonroof”, perfect for basking in the majesty of Origin System starlight.</p>
      <p>The Rising Tide Update will also bring new weapons, armor and cosmetics. The Cumulus Collection, an ethereal assortment of weapons, armor and cosmetics. Additionally new Equinox Antonym Collection offers Warframe’s master of day and night a new Antonym Skin. This skin transforms when Equinox shifts forms, as well Equinox’s signature Circadian Syandana and signature Astreos Sword and Shield Skin.</p>
      <p>Players can use resources obtained for free in-game in order to build the Dry Dock and Railjack. The Cumulus Collection and Equinox Antonym Collection can also be obtained through the Warframe Marketplace.</p>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>
