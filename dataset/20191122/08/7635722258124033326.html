        <b>Two-time Olympic medalist Paddy Barnes has announced his retirement from boxing after 21 years in the sport.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 32-year-old from Belfast won Olympic bronze in Beijing in 2008 and also won bronze four years later in London.</p>
      <p>In doing so, he became only the second Irish athlete to medal at successive Olympic Games.</p>
      <p>Barnes also won a gold medal at the 2010 European Championships and silver in 2013.</p>
      <p>The light-flyweight claimed gold medals at the Commonwealth Games in 2010 and 2014.</p>
      <p>Barnes didn't have the same success in the pro ranks but he did win a European title in June 2017 when he beat Silviu Olteanu in Belfast.</p>
      <p>He fought for a world title in his sixth pro bout but was stopped in the fourth round by Cristofer Rosales at Windsor Park.</p>
      <p>The last fight for Barnes was a fourth-round stoppage defeat to Welshman Jay Harris in October of this year.</p>
      <p>Barnes said "I have loved every minute of boxing, it has been my life for the past 21 years. I have achieved my dream of becoming an Olympian and getting to carry the Irish flag at the Olympic Games opening ceremony. Those moments were the proudest of my career.</p>
      <p>"Professional boxing was never a dream of mine but I tried and threw myself into the deep end straight away. It didn't work out but I wouldn't have it any other way."</p>

      <p>Barnes also thanked all the people that helped him achieve so much in the sport.</p>
      <p>"I'd like to thank my family for supporting me throughout my entire career, my wife Mari for keeping my feet firmly on the ground and helping me towards my goals.</p>
      <p>"I want to thank my parents Jimmy Linden, Gerry Storey, Seamy McCann and everyone at the Holy Family boxing club.</p>
      <p>"Also the HP coaches John Conlan, Zauri Antia, Billy Walsh and Eddie Bolger. I would also like to thank my professional coach Danny Vaughan who has been great to me."</p>
