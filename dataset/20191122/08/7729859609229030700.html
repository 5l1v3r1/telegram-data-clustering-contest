          </b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Who's in the play-offs?</h3>
      <p>Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are among the 16 nations who have secured a second chance of qualifying for Euro 2020 via next March's play-offs.</p>
      <p>The 16 teams will be divided into four play-off paths, as seen below (teams in <b>bold </b>are guaranteed in path)</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Path A: Iceland</b>, Bulgaria/Israel/Hungary/Romania*</li>
        <li><b>Path B:</b> <b>Bosnia and Herzegovina</b>, <b>Slovakia</b>, <b>Republic of Ireland</b>, <b>Northern Ireland</b></li>
        <li><b>Path C:</b> <b>Scotland</b>, <b>Norway</b>, <b>Serbia</b>, Bulgaria/Israel/Hungary/Romania*</li>
        <li><b>Path D:</b> <b>Georgia</b>, <b>North Macedonia</b>, <b>Kosovo</b>, <b>Belarus</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <i>*A draw will decide which of Bulgaria, Israel, Hungary or Romania would fill the empty slot in Path C, and which three would go into Path A.</i>
      </p>
      <h3>What's the play-off format?</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://e0.365dm.com/19/11/768x432/skysports-euro-2020-troph-trophy_4835039.jpg?20191113090145"/>
      </figure>
      <p>In a similar format to the EFL play-offs, the highest-ranked team in each path will host the fourth-ranked team in one semi-final, with the second-ranked nation hosting the third-ranked nation in the other. The host for the final in each play-off path will be drawn in advance by UEFA on Friday, November 22, 2019.</p>
      <p>The play-offs are played in single-leg knockout matches. The winners of the two semi-finals will meet in a one-off final where the winner will qualify for Euro 2020. If the matches are level after 90 minutes, extra time and penalties will be used to determine a winner.</p>
      <h3>Right, so who's playing who?</h3>
      <p>Things have become a lot clearer following the completion of the European Qualifiers campaign and the subsequent allocation of the 16 nations into the four play-off paths. Here's how things stand...</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Path A</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Semi-final 1:</b> Iceland vs fourth best-ranked team</li>
        <li><b>Semi-final 2:</b> Second best-ranked team vs third best-ranked team</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Path B</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Semi-final 1:</b> Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina vs <b>Northern Ireland</b></li>
        <li><b>Semi-final 2: </b>Slovakia vs <b>Republic of Ireland</b></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Path C</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Semi-final 1:</b> <b>Scotland </b>vs Bulgaria/Israel/Hungary/Romania</li>
        <li><b>Semi-final 2: </b>Norway vs Serbia</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Path D</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Semi-final 1: </b>Georgia vs Belarus</li>
        <li><b>Semi-final 2: </b>North Macedonia vs Kosovo</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>All-Irish final?</h3>

      <p><b>Northern Ireland</b> and the<b> Republic of Ireland </b>have had their routes confirmed, with the Republic travelling Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina and Northern Ireland away in Slovakia in the semi-finals in Path B.</p>
      <p>It means if both navigate their semi-final assignments, the two Irish nations will compete in a final for a place at next summer's tournament.</p>
      <h3>Scots yet to learn fate</h3>

        <figcaption>Scotland have the insurance of a Euro 2020 play-off after finishing top of their Nations League group above Israel and Albania last year</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Scotland</b>'s place in a home play-off semi-final was guaranteed before the conclusion of the European Qualifiers by virtue of topping their Nations League group, though they await the result of a UEFA draw to see which of Bulgaria/Israel/Hungary/Romania they are paired with in Path C.</p>
      <p>One of the four aforementioned nations will be paired with Scotland on November 22, with the other three filling the vacant slots in Path A.</p>
      <p>While Scotland remain in the dark over their semi-final opponents, what is certain is that they face a tough assignment against either Norway or Serbia in the Path C final, though their bid to reach a first major tournament finals since 1998 would be boosted if they were drawn to host the final.</p>
      <h3>When will the play-offs take place?</h3>
      <p>The Euro 2020 play-off semi-finals will be held on March 26, 2020 (7.45pm GMT), with the play-off finals taking place on March 31 (7.45pm BST). All of the matches are live on <i>Sky Sports</i>.</p>
      <h3>What's the prize for the Path winners?</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The four play-off Path winners will secure the final four places at Euro 2020. Each nation will be placed into Pot 4 in the draw for next summer's tournament finals on November 30, meaning nations participating will know who they will face at Euro 2020 four months before they try to navigate the play-offs.</p>
