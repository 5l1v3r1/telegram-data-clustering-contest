      <p>The Centre will introduce the Special Protection Group (Amendment) Bill, 2019 in Parliament next week, Union Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal told the Lok Sabha on Friday. </p>
      <p>The move comes days after the government withdrew the SPG security cover given to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her children, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.</p>
      <p>According to official sources, the amendments approved by the Union Cabinet exclude family members of former Prime Ministers from SPG protection.</p>
      <p>The SPG, an elite protection force, was set up in 1985 after the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Under the SPG Act, the force provides security to the Prime Minister and the members of his immediate family. In the case of a former Prime Minister and immediate family, the SPG cover will be on for one year from the date he or she ceases to hold office and beyond one year based on the level of threat.</p>
      <p>Mr. Meghwal also announced that the Centre would introduce a Bill to merge the two Union Territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Daman and Diu. </p>
      <p>A few other Bills feature on the list of business to be transacted next week in the winter session of Parliament. They include the International Financial Services Centres Authority Bill, 2019; the Recycling of Ships Bill, 2019; the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Recognition of Property Rights of Residents in Unauthorised Colonies) Bill, 2019 and the Industrial Relations Code Bill, 2019.</p>
