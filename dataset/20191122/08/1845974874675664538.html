      <h4>Chelsea and Manchester City went into the international break on very different notes, but will have similar motivations in the first game back. Here are few aspects on which the game may turn.</h4>
      <p>Manchester City took a loss at Liverpool into the international break, leaving Premier League fans wondering who can and will stop Liverpool. Chelsea have a more immediate concern: stopping Manchester City.</p>
      <h3>1. Can Chelsea corral Kevin De Bruyne?</h3>
      <p>While 3-1 the scoreline suggests Manchester City were summarily beaten down by Liverpool two weekends ago, the result itself doesn’t show just how dominant City were for large stretches of the match. Unsurprisingly, most of Manchester City’s best moments came from excellent play by Kevin De Bruyne.</p>
      <p>De Bruyne is arguably the best player in the Premier League this season, and is on pace to break Thierry Henry’s league record of 20 assists in a season. Had it not been for Sergio Aguero’s chronic inability to score at Anfield, he could already be in double digits.</p>
      <p>Shutting down De Bruyne is every team’s first directive when playing City, but it’s easier said than done. Chelsea, however, have perhaps the one player capable of accomplishing just that. N’golo Kante is the <a href="https://theprideoflondon.com/2019/11/21/chelsea-manchester-city-combined-xi-ngolo-kante-kevin-de-bruyne/"><b>perfect foil for someone like De Bruyne</b></a>: he’s quick, smart, aggressive, and he doesn’t foul too much. That last part is key.</p>
      <p>Avoiding fouls in the defensive third will need to be a huge part of Chelsea’s game plan, given how good De Bruyne is in dead ball situations. You only have to watch the first 15 minutes of the Liverpool match to see him nearly create two goals from opposites sides of the pitch.</p>
      <p>Chelsea have been far too charitable when defending set pieces this season. If they give away too many chances, City is bound to capitalize on at least one.</p>
      <p>Even when we’re talking about Kante, though, stopping De Bruyne isn’t a one man job. Both fullbacks, whoever they may be, will need to be on high alert to prevent any early balls into the box. If things are congested in the middle, De Bruyne can drift out toward either touchline and send in early crosses. The variety of ways in which he can pick apart opposing defenses makes him so incredibly dangerous.</p>
      <p>If Chelsea actually manage to take him out of the game, it will be the result of a perfectly orchestrated full-team effort. Otherwise, he’ll be the one orchestrating Chelsea’s demise.</p>
      <p>Ugh, just imagine him in this current Chelsea squad. Thanks for nothing, Jose Mourinho.</p>
