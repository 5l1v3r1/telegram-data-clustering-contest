      <p>The 6th edition of the Simply Nigerian Fair will take place on Sunday, November 24th at the Garden Fusion Centre, 10 Adekunle Lawal street, Ikoyi.</p>
      <p>The Simply Nigerian Fair (SNF) promotes home-grown businesses by providing them an affordable platform through which to showcase their products, increase their market, broaden their networks and add value to their businesses.</p>
      <p>The Simply Nigerian Fair typically attracts more than 1200 shoppers keen to sample the different products and services on display, from food and drinks to hair and beauty, home and lifestyle, plants and flowers, fabrics and footwear and fresh produce.</p>
      <p>The upcoming 6th edition of SNF is the perfect place to discover new Nigerian brands and buy high-quality gifts for Christmas.</p>
      <p>Temi Shenjobi, who runs the event with her fellow co-director, Linda Okome, Penelope Gobir and Nkiru Asika says:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“People look forward to SNF because it has a completely different vibe from any other Fair. We’re in a lush garden setting in the heart of Ikoyi and we showcase proudly Nigerian businesses. It’s a perfect way to spend a Sunday afternoon – eating, drinking, shopping, catching up with friends and supporting local entrepreneurs at the same time.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>As part of their commitment to supporting home-grown businesses, the SNF team also organizes capacity building workshops for all Vendors before each Fair.</p>
      <p>This edition, the Vendors will benefit from presentations by human resource strategist Samuel Omole, John-Bede Antonio export consultant and business owners Theresa Onwuka of The Needle Point, Kehinde Daniel of Kots Catering and Sola Mogaji aka Schullzz.</p>
      <p>SNF has become a powerful platform for the local retail ecosystem as well as a favourite for savvy shoppers in Lagos.</p>
