      <h1>Samsung Galaxy S11 Receives Certification; May Include 5G Connectivity, 25W Fast Charging And More</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:43:53+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/bryanlim/" target="_blank">Bryan Lim</a></address>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy S11 series is not expected to launch for several more months, but that isn’t stopping rumours of the device finding their way to the internet. Recently, a certification listing filed by Samsung with the China Compulsory Certificate office shed some light over some of the featured that allegedly belong to the upcoming flagship.</p>
      <p>Based on the listing, the device – listed as SM-G9860 – will supposedly be a “5G digital mobile telephone set”, alluding to the possibility that the supposed Galaxy S11 will bear 5G connectivity. On top of that, the phone will also feature support for 25W fast-charging.</p>
      <p>Prior to this report, serial leakster, Ice Universe (@UniverseIce) had previously leaked a screenshot of Samsung’s One UI 2.0 beta running on the Galaxy Note9. With the option to switch the refresh rate between 60Hz and 120Hz. The fact that the feature is being tested out on One UI 2.0 beta hints at the likelihood of the Galaxy S11 shipping out with a 120Hz refresh rate display.</p>

      <p>And while the listing doesn’t speak of it, let’s not forget about the possibility of the upcoming Galaxy S11’s main camera module utilising either of Samsung’s 64MP or <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/198821/samsung-galaxy-s11-series-heres-what-we-know-so-far/">108MP</a> camera sensors, as well as Samsung’s next-generation <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/197257/samsung-announces-exynos-990-soc-and-5g-exynos-modem-5123/">Exynos 990 chipset</a> as well. Oh, and the possibility of the Galaxy S11 using Samsung’s new <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/198694/samsung-patents-samoled-display-name-may-appear-on-galaxy-s11-series/">SAMOLED display</a> technology.</p>
      <p>As the time of writing, Samsung has not made any official announcements about the Galaxy S11, neither has it confirmed or denied the filing being in reference to the alleged flagship. So, do take this news with a liberal sprinkling of salt until then.</p>
