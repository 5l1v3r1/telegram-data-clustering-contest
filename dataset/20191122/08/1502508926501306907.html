      <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday constituted a three-member advisory committee to assist DHFL's administrator in discharge of his duties.</p>
      <p>The three-member advisory committee would comprise of Rajiv Lall, non-executive chairman, IDFC First Bank Ltd, N S Kannan, managing director and CEO, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd, and NS Venkatesh, chief executive, Association of Mutual Funds in India.</p>
      <p>The appointment is in line with Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code rules that provide for the concerned financial sector regulator appointing a committee of advisors to advise the administrator in the operations of the financial service provider during the insolvency resolution process.</p>
      <p>The RBI on Wednesday had appointed R Subramaniakumar, former managing director and chief executive of Indian Overseas Bank, as the administrator of DHFL, to run the affairs of the entity which was once controlled by the Wadhawan family.</p>
      <p>Banking sources said the size of DHFLâ€™s debt on book is large (about Rs 94,000 crore) and its administrator will need assistance in creating a resolution plan. The administrator will also finalise the timetable for financial performance review.</p>
      <p>Lenders are already working at a new plan for resolution after the IBC proceedings against <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/dhfl">DHFL </a>are admitted in the NCLT. Under this, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/finance-news-banks-1030101.htm">banks </a>might convert a part of their loans to equity. Lenders also plan to get private equity investors for fresh capital.</p>
