      <h1>Netflix denies casting Imelda Staunton to replace Olivia Colman in The Crown</h1>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> has denied that it has cast British actress Imelda Staunton as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/olivia-colman/">Olivia Colman</a>’s replacement for future seasons of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-crown/">The Crown</a>.</p>
      <p>The concept of the show sees the core cast replaced by older actors after every two seasons, seeing the characters of the Royal Family ‘age up’ without the need for special effects.</p>
      <p>Oscar-winner Colman replaced Claire Foy after two seasons, and The Favourite star is currently filming for her second and final stint in the role for season four of the show.</p>
      <p>It was first reported by the Daily Mail that the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-potter/">Harry Potter</a> actress was ”approached by senior producers and casting directors to play the Queen from her mid-60s on,’ portraying Queen Elizabeth II for seasons five and six of the historical drama.</p>
      <p>But now, Netflix have denied the rumours, stating that any casting news is just ‘pure speculation’.</p>

      <p>The streaming service said in a statement: ‘We are currently filming season 4 of The Crown but have not commissioned any further seasons as yet.</p>
      <p>‘Therefore any news on casting remains pure speculation.’</p>

      <p>If indeed commissioned, series five and six of the opulent drama would most likely follow the Queen from the 1990s into the early 00s. That’s a pretty tightly-packed period of history for the Queen too.</p>
      <p>We’d have her infamous ‘annus horribilus’ to look forward to; the year where two of her children – Prince Andrew and Princess Anne – separated from their partners and Windsor Castle was badly damaged in a fire.</p>
      <p>Of course, we’d also see the much-touted adaptation of the tragic death of Diana, Princess of Wales. The iconic princess is currently being played by Emma Corrin in the fourth series.</p>
      <p>Pictures of the actress alongside co-star Josh O’Connor reveal that Corrin is indeed<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/08/the-crown-season-4-photos-floor-fans-as-emma-corrin-is-identical-to-princess-diana-10880225/"> the spitting image of the people’s princess</a>.</p>
      <p>Another new arrival for the upcoming fourth season will be Margaret Thatcher, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/07/gillian-anderson-confirmed-play-margaret-thatcher-crown-series-4-10702740/">who will be played by The Fall star Gillian Anderson</a>.</p>
      <p>Peter Morgan, the creator and writer of the show, revealed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/the-crown-boss-teases-paradigm-shift-arrival-of-gillian-andersons-margaret-thatcher-in-season-4-11195670/">that the show will experience a ‘paradigm shift’ with the arrival of the Iron Lady</a>.</p>

      <p>‘[Thatcher] is a twin. They were born just six months apart. They’ve got an awful lot in common, not least their gender.’</p>
