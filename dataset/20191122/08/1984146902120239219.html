      <p>A convicted sex offender went "under the radar" of police for 18 months - during which time he had regular access to three young girls.</p>
      <p>Lewis Geary was supposed to be being monitored in the community after he was given a sexual offences prevention order for indecent images offences.</p>
      <p>The order prohibited him from having unsupervised contacted with girls under 16 unless it was inadvertent or the parents of the youngsters were aware of his conviction.</p>
      <p>But he moved into his girlfriend's family home, without telling police, and while there he came into regular contact with three young girls - and had a video of one of them dancing on his phone.</p>
      <p>Although he did not do anything to the youngsters, their parents were horrified to find out he was a sex offender and said they would never have let him near their children if they had known.</p>
      <p>Newcastle Crown Court heard he had also been employed by Pizza Hut, despite them knowing of his conviction, although that employment has since been terminated.</p>
      <p>Now the 24-year-old, of Wenlock Road, South Shields, has been jailed for 32 months for breaching the sexual harm prevention order and failing to comply with his sex offender registration requirements.</p>
      <p>Judge Stephen Earl said it was the "worst breach without any new offending that I have seen" as he sentenced him.</p>
      <p>He told Geary: "You were under the radar, the police did not know where you were living and to whom you had access.</p>
      <p>"The parents did not know you, a sex offender, had access to their children.</p>
      <p>"It's not about whether you were doing anything to the children, it's about the risk you posed as a sex offender."</p>
      <p>The court heard Geary had been given a five-year sexual offences prevention order in October 2014 as part of a three year community order for making and possessing indecent images of children.</p>
      <p>But by the time police caught up with him, he had moved out of the address he was supposed to live at and had been with his girlfriend's family for 18 months.</p>
      <p>Judge Earl said: "A third of the order was spend with you actively in breach of the order.</p>
      <p>"You were, frankly, under the management compliance regime's radar.</p>
      <p>"The whole purpose of having the notification requirement is so they can track you.</p>
      <p>"These are the checks and balances you flouted as a result of the fact you were under the radar."</p>
      <p>It was in June this year that a risk management officer went to Geary's home to check on him.</p>
      <p>When his phone was looked at their was a video of a fully clothed 13-year-old girl dancing and there had been calls and texts between him and her.</p>
      <p>He was asked about any other internet enabled devices and at his girlfriend's home police found a Playstation he had not disclosed, which was another breach.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the mother of the 13-year-old was spoken to and she confirmed the youngster would stay over at Geary's girlfriend's home and spend time with him and her.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Neil Pallister said: "Police disclosed the defendant's criminal history to her and obviously, it goes without saying, she was very shocked and distressed to learn about his past offending behaviour.</p>
      <p>"She said in no uncertain terms, he as a sex offender, she would not have allowed her daughter to have any contact at all with the defendant."</p>
      <p>The 13-year-old confirmed there were occasions when she had been alone with Geary when his girlfriend had left the room.</p>
      <p>The court heard a five-year-old girl had also stayed overnight at the family home of Geary's girlfriend and he and her had taken the child out, including to the park.</p>
      <p>When told of Geary's history, the girl's dad said he would not have allowed him to have contact with her had he known.</p>
      <p>Geary's partner had also looked after a two-year-old girl, babysitting on a regular basis while Geary was present.</p>
      <p>The mother of the child also said she would not have allowed Geary to have contact with the girl if she knew of his conviction.</p>
      <p>Geary pleaded guilty to breaching his sexual harm prevention order by having unsupervised contact with the girls and not providing the Playstation to police for inspection and failing to comply with his sex offender notification requirements by failing to notify a change of address.</p>
      <p>As well as the prison sentence, he was made subject to a sexual harm prevention order and must sign the sex offender register, the previous requirements having now lapsed.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Coxon, defending, said Geary was naive and embarrassed about his convictions.</p>
      <p>She added: "He accepts when he moved in with her parents and he had contact with various children he didn't tell the parents, or the children's parents, about his convictions."</p>
      <p>Miss Coxon said Geary had been welcomed into the family with "open arms" but had not been honest in return, although he had told his girlfriend about his conviction.</p>
      <p>She said Geary had been "socially isolated" at the time of the original offences and had low self esteem which led to excessive drinking.</p>
      <p>Miss Coxon told the court: "He wanted to live a normal life but, unfortunately, went about it the wrong way."</p>
      <p>Of his previous employment, she added: "He worked at Pizza Hut. He disclosed his conviction to them.</p>
      <p>"Pizza Hut had difficulty managing his own risk in the workplace and they terminated his contract."</p>
