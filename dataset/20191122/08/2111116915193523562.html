      <p>Yes, with a full week to go before <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a>, many stores just couldn't wait any longer and have launched loads of deals already. Naturally, the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/amazon-black-friday-deals-2019">Amazon Black Friday deals</a> are running front and centre today and the camera-enabled Ring doorbells are among some of our favourite items so far.</p>
      <p>Our runaway pick of the bunch is the bundle with a Ring Video Doorbell Pro and an Amazon Echo Show 5 that saves you as mighty £159.99. The smart speaker with a screen lets you see who is at the door and even allows you to speak to them (or ignore them if they have a clipboard) without opening the door. And the smart screen has plenty of other uses too such as video calls, music and video playback and the Alexa smart assistant.</p>
      <p>If you don't fancy the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/amazon-echo-show-5">Echo Show 5</a>, then you can always use your phone, tablet or PC to see who is at the door – you don't even have to be at home. There are two options for picking up a discounted Ring Doorbell on its own too, one of which is particularly useful if you rent your home and don't want to mess about with wires and drills.</p>
