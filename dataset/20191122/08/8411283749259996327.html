      <h1>EIH to ship colored e-book reader solutions in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:13:14+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:13</time> by <a rel="author">Rebecca Kuo, Tainan; Steve Shen, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>E-paper solution provider E Ink Holdings (EIH) is currently undergoing design-in processes for colored e-paper solutions for the next-generation e-book readers with shipments of related products to kick off in 2020, according to company acting chairman Johnson Lee.</p>
      <p>The global e-book reader ecosystem is set for significant change when EIH's clients in Europe and China launch colored e-book readers in 2020, Lee said at the company's latest investors meeting.</p>
      <p>The development of colored e-paper solutions has been positive in 2019 and will continue in 2020, resulting in expanded revenues for EIH, Lee said, adding that contribution from colored e-paper solutions is still not significant in 2019 but will expand meaningfully in 2020.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, EIH will see its shipments of electronic shelf label (ESL) solutions grow 20-30% on year in 2019 and continue to expand at a similar pace in the coming year, Lee added.</p>
      <p>The company also plans to develop colored e-notebook solutions targeting educational and professional applications in China and Japan.</p>
      <p>EIH posted net profit of NT$1.15 billion (US$37.67 million) for the third quarter of 2019, up 30% on quarter and 36.9% on year. For the first three quarters of 2019, net profit totaled NT$2.47 billion, increasing 42% from a year earlier.</p>
