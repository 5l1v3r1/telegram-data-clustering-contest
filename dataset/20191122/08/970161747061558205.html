      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-simpsons/">The Simpsons</a> may have waned in quality over the past 20 years or so, but let’s face it – you still wouldn’t turn down the chance to have your voice heard in Springfield.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/charlie-brooker/">Charlie Brooker</a> certainly didn’t want to pass on that kind of opportunity, and the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/black-mirror/">Black Mirror</a> creator has now announced that he’ll be making a special guest appearance in this weekend’s Thanksgiving-themed episode.</p>
      <p>Simpsons executive producer Matt Selman first invited Brooker to provide a guest voice on ‘a Black Mirror-ish episode’ back in August, owing to the fact that the long-running cartoon’s production team were ‘super fans’ of the dystopian <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> series.</p>

      <p>Thanksgiving of Horror – a three-stories-in-one episode much like the Halloween-themed Treehouse of Horror series – will air in the US this Sunday (24 November) ahead of next week’s Thanksgiving celebrations.</p>
      <p>Brooker says that not only is the forthcoming episode ‘bloody GREAT’, there’s also ‘a bunch of Black Mirror Easter eggs in it’.</p>
      <p>A must-watch for Black Mirror and Simpsons fans alike, then – although the current season of The Simpsons (its 31st season, no less) isn’t expected to hit UK screens until 2020.</p>

      <p>UK Simpsons fans will be looking forward to the arrival of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/disney/">Disney+</a> in the UK in March – although the arrival of the subscription service in North America has already drawn complaints about how they’ve chosen to screen the show.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/simpsons-fans-livid-disney-streaming-service-really-messes-accidentally-cut-iconic-jokes-11089828/">Disney+’s decision to keep the cropped 16:9 format</a> for its Simpsons re-runs – which had already caused consternation back on FX in 2014 – means that a number of visual gags from the originals can’t be seen on the streaming service.</p>
      <p>Here’s hoping they sort that out by the time Disney+ arrives on these shores – otherwise how are we going to find all those Black Mirror Easter eggs?</p>
