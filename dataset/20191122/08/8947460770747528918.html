      <p>The Rolls-Royce Bespoke Design division brings customers’ dreams to life. The Falcon Wraith, the latest creation in a long list of masterpieces involved minute craftmanship and dedication to achieve an unmatched performance: embroidery on leather upholstery. The Rolls-Royce Falcon Wraith is the newest one-off mastered by Bespoke Design, based on the luxury Grand Tourer of the brand. The centerpiece of this motoring piece of art was the peregrine falcon, the fastest bird in the world, which is renowned for its power and speed.</p>

      <p>The intricate embroidery, which is exposed on the headlining of the Falcon Wraith, took over a month to complete. Before starting the complex task, artists from the Bespoke Design division dedicated their time to closely study the bird of prey in nature as to visually understand the magnitude of this project.</p>

      <p>Every shade, every muscularity feature, the way the feathers are disposed, the various angles and proportions of the falcon’s body, every single detail was taken care of  and examined methodically as to achieve a maximum level of genuineness.</p>
      <p>Josh Liles, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Bespoke Embroidery Specialist, comments on this new bespoke project: “The Falcon embroidery became a labour of love. Technically, it is exceptionally difficult to embroider this density of stitches onto leather. Embroidery puts stress and tension on leather causing a physical wave in the material, which naturally, is unacceptable in a Rolls-Royce.”</p>

      <p>The intricate embroidery puts the peregrine falcon in its natural habitat: the sky. The background of the headlining is finished in pale blue color. As well, the exterior of the car is adorned in Bala Blue and Andalusian White colors. The graphic motif of falcon’s wing is artistically painted between the two rear seats and on the car’s exterior white-painted coachline.</p>
