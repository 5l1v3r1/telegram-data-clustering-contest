      <p>Erika Renner was attacked, drugged and mutilated by her former lover in March 2013.</p>
      <p>The criminal procedure dragged on for six years and the young Hungarian told Euronews it was an ordeal.</p>
      <p>"They treated me like... scenery, I was an object in my own case ... I only had duties, an obligation to testify, to tell the truth... and meanwhile the legal system was not at all interested in me as a human being," she said.</p>
      <p>Eventually, her ex-partner was sentenced to 11 years in prison.</p>

      <p>Renner is not an isolated case. Every fifth Hungarian woman lives in a physically abusive relationship, according to 2018 data compiled by Women for Women against Violence, an NGO.</p>
      <p>Women's rights groups have repeatedly demanded their government take urgent action against domestic violence - starting with the ratification of the <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/istanbul-convention/home?">Istanbul Convention Action against violence against women and domestic violence</a>.</p>
      <p>According to Judit Wirth, head of NAN, a women rights group, one key problem is that Hungarian police and justice staff are not sufficiently prepared to deal with domestic violence cases.</p>
      <p>"The fight against violence on women is a profession in itself, the people working in these fields do not receive any training in it - you can clearly see the result in everyday practice," she told Euronews.</p>
      <p>In recent years, the Conservative government has been reluctant to work with women NGOs, claiming their ideology is against the interests of the Hungarian state</p>
