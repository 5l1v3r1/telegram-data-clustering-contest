      <p>Kate Garraway's husband Derek Draper has admitted that he was desperate to jet to I'm A Celebrity after noticing a heartbreaking moment that many may have missed.</p>
      <p>Appearing on Good Morning Britain today with their two children Bill and Darcey, Derek said that he was incredibly proud of Kate.</p>
      <p>After suggesting that she could win the show, he joked about Kate saying that she missed her children but hadn't said anything about him.</p>
      <p>But Derek also said that Kate is struggling more than she had let on.</p>
      <p>"The bit that I thought really upset for her was something people might not have noticed," he said. "There was some good news delivered about the food or wagon wheels.</p>

      <p>"Everyone was jumping and hugging and she turned to hug someone but everyone was hugging someone. And I wanted to dive into the television and give her a big hug.</p>
      <p>"So it is hard seeing her struggle with things but at the same time I know she likes a challenge."</p>
      <p>Questioned about the rumours she has smuggled make-up in, Derek said: "I think it’s probably harder to smuggle gold out of Fort Knox than make-up into I’m A Celeb. For sure she’s not. But I said, she never looks better than first thing in the morning.”</p>

      <p>He added: "We want her back but it is a bit tidier without her."</p>
      <p>Asked whether she would wear a bikini in the jungle shower, he said: "She’s got some bikinis that cover her up a little bit. At the bottom of the case, she’s got a few skimpier ones.</p>
      <p>"She said ‘I don’t think I’ll wear these’. I of course think she looks amazing and said, ‘Wear them if you want to’. We’ll see, we’ll see which bikini comes out."</p>
