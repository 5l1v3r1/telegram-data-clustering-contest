      <p>More than a year after a Panchkula resident’s death, the consumer forum has directed his mother, the beneficiary of his insurance policy, to share the money with his widow and minor son.</p>
      <p>The forum also asked the mother and the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) to jointly pay her son’s widow and latter’s child Rs 20,000 as compensation and Rs 10,000 as cost of litigation.</p>
      <p>Deepika Dahiya of Panchkula along with her two-year-old son, Navdeep Singh, had moved the Consumer Forum against the LIC after her husband Amardeep Singh died on January 4, 2018. Prior to his marriage, Amardeep had bought three life insurance policies from LIC’s Sector 17 <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a> branch. In the policies, Amardeep had named his mother Kamla Devi as nominee.</p>
      <p>Even after his marriage, Amardeep failed to change the nominee. After his death, Deepika came to know about the nomination and wrote to LIC asking it not to disburse the sum assured to Kamla Devi. She said that as his widow, she and her minor son were the legal heirs of Amardeep. However, LIC disbursed the amount totalling Rs 15,09,180 to Kamla Devi, following which Deepika filed a formal case at the forum on November 13, 2018.</p>
      <p>The LIC submitted in the forum that as per provisions of the relevant Act, the amount was disbursed to the policy holder’s nominee. It accepted having received the communication from Deepika, but added that the request was not acceded to as the nomination could not have been changed after the death of the assured while no succession certificate was produced.</p>
      <p>Kamla Devi also filed a separate reply stating that since she happens to be the nominee, she is entitled to the payout.</p>
      <p>The forum, after hearing the arguments, held that “…mere nomination made under Section 39 of the Insurance Act does not confer beneficial interest on the nominee under the life insurance policy on the death of the assured. The said amount can be claimed by the heirs of the assured in accordance with the law of succession governing them…Admittedly, the complainants and OP-2 (Kamla Devi) are his first class legal heirs as per Hindu succession Act, 1956 as the deceased had died intestate and they were entitled to succeed to the sum assured to the extent of 1/3rd share each as in the capacity of a nominee the amount is disbursed or taken or received subject to claim of all the legal heirs as he had not willed away his property…”</p>
      <p>The forum stated that keeping in view the factual and legal position, the sum assured of three policies was to be apportioned amongst Deepika Dahiya, her son and Kamla Devi proportionately in equal shares. As such, LIC has also committed deficiency in service and liability of LIC would be joint as well as several as it tantamounts to deficiency in service and unfair trade practice.</p>
      <p>The forum thus directed Kamla Devi to refund an amount of Rs 5,03,060 each to Deepika and her son, which is 1/3rd share each of the total disbursed amount, alongwith interest at 9 per cent per annum from the date of disbursal which is May 9, 2018. It also directed the mother and the LIC to pay Rs 20,000 as compensation and Rs 10,000 as cost of litigation.</p>
