      <p>Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford has made it clear that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the right manager for the Red Devils after the club was linked with Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino was linked with the job at Manchester United before Solskjaer was given the full-time job by Red Devils' chiefs.</p>
      <p>And after the Argentine football manager was sacked at Tottenham, there have been talks that he could be heading to Manchester United as a replacement for Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>But according to the report on UK Sun, Marcus Rashford has offered his support for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer claiming he deserves to go on with Manchester United.</p>
