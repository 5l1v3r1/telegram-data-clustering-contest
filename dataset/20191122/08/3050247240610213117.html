      <h1>China: Shenzhen Identifies 39 Crypto Exchanges Defying Trading Ban</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:11:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:11</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrency-exchange">Cryptocurrency exchanges</a> operating illegally in one city in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/china">China</a> will face the wrath of a joint government effort to oust them, reports claim.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 22, authorities in Shenzhen have identified a total of 39 exchanges falling foul of China’s cryptocurrency trading ban, according to local news outlet <a href="https://m.sohu.com/a/355351861_100117963/?pvid=000115_3w_a">Sanyan Finance</a>. </p>
      <h3>PBoC highlights Bitcoin and Ethereum in probe</h3>
      <p>The operation reportedly included participation from China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the Economic Investigation Bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Communications Administration. </p>
      <p>It remains unknown what consequences the exchanges will face, with Sanyan highlighting a desire to crack down on liquidity.</p>
      <p>A rough translation states the measures involve a three-pronged approach:</p>
      <blockquote>“It is reported that the action will focus on three activities: first, providing virtual currency trading services or opening virtual currency trading places in China; second, providing service channels for overseas virtual currency trading places, including services such as drainage and agency trading; Sell ​​tokens in various names, raise funds for investors or virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.”</blockquote>
      <p>Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-tech-capital-shenzhen-issues-warning-against-crypto-activities">previously noted</a> the existence of the Shenzhen plans, which also target entities beyond the exchange sector.</p>
      <h3>No police raids took place, says Binance</h3>
      <p>As Cointelegraph reported, China continues to present a varied stance on cryptocurrency. After publicly <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-blockchain-is-the-future-but-keep-it-rational-avoid-aircoins">voicing support</a> for <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain">blockchain</a> technology last month, Chinese media <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-warns-against-cryptocurrency-speculation-amid-blockchain-hype">issued warnings</a> not to confuse the policy for endorsement of phenomena such as Bitcoin. </p>
      <p>This week, meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/binance">Binance</a> denied rumors police had <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-denies-police-raids-very-existence-of-shanghai-offices">raided its office</a> in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/shanghai">Shanghai</a>. Shortly afterward, fellow exchange <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bithumb">Bithumb</a> similarly <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bithumb-quashes-shanghai-office-closure-rumors-after-binance-denial">rejected</a> the idea it planned to close its Shanghai outpost, while Huobi stated likewise.</p>
      <p>“We have heard of this from some media reports. However, we have not received any specific instructions at this point,” a Huobi representative said.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the Shenzhen move, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhang praised what he saw as an effort to remove bad actors.</p>
      <p>“This is actually a very good thing to happen, cleaning up the industry of scammers and fraudsters,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1197776692372103168">wrote</a> in response to PrimitiveCrypto’s founding partner, Dovey Wan.</p>
      <p>Wan had <a href="https://twitter.com/DoveyWan/status/1197769362901364736">claimed</a> that the targets of the shutdown were “most likely are ponzi and crypto frauds as Shenzhen is known for being the hub of those.”</p>
