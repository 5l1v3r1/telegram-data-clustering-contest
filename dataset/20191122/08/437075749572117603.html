      <h1>Why Chiefs is not ready for a women’s team yet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:10:56+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:10</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Mothowagae</a></address>
      <p>As much as Kaizer Chiefs is considered a trendsetter, the premier league brand is not in a hurry to establish a women’s football team.</p>
      <p>This is despite high expectations from the brand that, in 2012, founded a sevens rugby team – the only local football club with such diversity.</p>
      <p>Expectations were that Amakhosi would have formed a women’s football club in a year that saw Banyana Banyana make their maiden World Cup appearance, as well as the South African Football Association finally launching a national women’s league – albeit not yet fully professional.</p>
      <p>Chiefs marketing director Jessica Motaung explained that there were a number of things to consider.</p>
      <p>“Yes, people have bantered about us starting a team. It’s something that you don’t do lightly,” said Motaung, who gave the same response at the CAF Women’s football strategy task force workshop in Cairo, Egypt, during the just-concluded Fifa international break.</p>
      <p>The 46 year old was invited to the two-day event as part of the first task force to work out a strategy for women’s football in Africa.</p>
      <p>Motaung said a lot of research was being done behind the scenes before Chiefs would consider following the likes of Mamelodi Sundowns and Bloemfontein Celtic, who are the only two clubs in the women’s national league that are linked to the PSL clubs.</p>
      <p>“Girls and women have different needs and, for me, it’s important to do a complete analysis. I have been doing case studies about what other clubs have done and it’s something you want to do properly with the right systems. In fact, I am putting together a task force with people who have been in the game,” said Motaung, adding that she was observing the Safa national women’s league.</p>
      <p>How can we build women’s football and do it in a way that it’s going to enhance the game – not in way that is going to compete with men’s football but rather be complementaryJessica Motaung</p>
      <p>“It’s important to [learn from others]. At some point I do believe it’s critical that we do have a professional women’s league.</p>
      <p>“But I think it starts from a country strategy. The continent is looking at us to play a key role.”</p>
      <p>Motaung, who represents Chiefs on the PSL’s board of governors, missed the premier league’s annual general meeting last week to honour the CAF invite.</p>
      <p>“It was a great opportunity to engage with a number of women from different areas and disciplines. It was lovely to share ideas. We were asked to come with a different view of how we can build women’s football and do it in a way that it’s going to enhance the game – not in way that is going to compete with men’s football but rather be complementary.”</p>
