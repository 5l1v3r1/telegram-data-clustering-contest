      <p><b>LES MUREAUX, FranceÂ (AP)</b> - Activists say more than 130 women have died from domestic violence this year alone in France.</p>
      <p>European Union studies show France has a higher rate of domestic violence than most of its European peers. Frustrated activists are now drawing national attention to a problem President Emmanuel Macron has called "France's shame."</p>
      <p>They have glued posters with the names of the dead to French city walls. By the hundreds, they have walked silently through city streets after each new death.</p>
      <p>Two years after Macron made a campaign pledge to tackle the problem, the government has begun to act.</p>
      <p>The government will announce measures Monday that are expected to include seizing firearms from suspects, prioritizing police training and formally recognizing "psychological violence" as a form of domestic violence.</p>
