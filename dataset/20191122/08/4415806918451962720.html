      <h1>Olympic medallist Paddy Barnes retires after 21 years in boxing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:09:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Paddy Barnes has retired from boxing.</p>
      <p>The Belfast native won bronze medals in the light flyweight division at the Beijing and London Olympics before carrying the Irish flag at the Rio Olympics.</p>
      <p>He also won a gold medal at the 2010 European Championships and in the Commonwealth Games before claiming silver in 2013 at the European Championships and another Commonwealth in 2014.</p>
      <p>He then turned professional in 2016 which saw him win the vacant vacant WBO European flyweight title against Silviu Olteanu of Romania.</p>
      <p>After 21 years in the sport, he announced his decision on Twitter saying: "After taking some time I've came to a decision to retire. I've had a great career and achieved so much.</p>
      <p>"I have loved every minute of boxing, it has been my life for the past 21 years. I have achieved my dream of becoming an Olympian and getting to carry the Irish flag at the Olympic Games opening ceremony. Those moments were the proudest of my career.</p>
      <p>"Professional boxing was never a dream of mine but I tried and threw myself into the deep end straight away. It didn't work out but I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>

      <p>"I'd like to thank my family for supporting me throughout my entire career, my wife Mari for keeping my feet firmly on the ground and helping me towards my goals.</p>
      <p>"I want to thank my parents Jimmy Linden, Gerry Storey, Seamy McCann and everyone at the Holy Family boxing club.</p>
      <p>"Also the HP coaches John Conlan, Zauri Antia, Billy Walsh and Eddie Bolger. I would also like to thank my professional coach Danny Vaughan who has been great to me."</p>
      <p>He made his professional debut with a win over Stefan Slavchev in November 2016.</p>
      <p>Barnesâ€™ first defeat came with a knock-out loss to Cristofer Rosales at Windsor Park in August last year, and he was beaten by Oscar Mojica at Madison Square Garden in March.</p>
      <p>Barnes had said he was considering his future after losing to Jay Harris in Belfast in October.</p>
