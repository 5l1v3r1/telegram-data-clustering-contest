      <h1>West Brom v Sheffield Wednesday: Slaven Bilic to plug cracks in his foundations</h1>
      <h2>Decisions, decisions... Slaven Bilic has plenty of them to make ahead of tomorrow’s game.</h2>

      <p>In what has been a stellar start to his career as Albion head coach, Bilic has proved adept as both a man-manager as well as a tactician.</p>
      <p>Bringing in the likes of attacking duo Grady Diangana and Matheus Pereira – and getting the best out of them – has proved a masterstroke by the Croatian.</p>
      <p>Their form has helped Albion rocket to the summit of the Championship.</p>
      <p>But like any rocket, forward momentum has to come from a solid base – and it is in that respect that Bilic must make the most of his tactical nous.</p>
      <p>That’s because he will be without two of his most influential men in midfield pairing Jake Livermore and Romaine Sawyers.</p>
      <p>In Albion’s early-season surge, that duo has provided the base from which Baggies have built upon.</p>
      <p>However, they will both sit out the game against the Owls having both picked up their fifth yellow cards of the season in the victory over Hull.</p>
      <p>Nathan Ferguson will also be able to get in some early Christmas shopping as he serves the final game of his three-match suspension following his red card against Charlton.</p>
      <p>But it is the midfield engine room that will be at the forefront of Bilic’s mind.</p>
      <p>On the upside, Bilic has strength in depth in terms of midfielders in his squad.</p>
      <p>Gareth Barry is available for selection having finally recovered from his career-threatening knee injury.</p>
      <p>The veteran stated this week that he is ‘ready to go’ if called upon, but the former Villa man has only a couple of reserve games under his belt.</p>
      <p>Bilic may feel this game, against eighth-placed Wednesday, could be a little too soon to thrust him back into the starting line-up.</p>
      <p>It is unlikely Rekeem Harper will start, with the boss appearing distrustful of the youngster’s positional discipline.</p>
      <p>Bilic could move Semi Ajayi forward from centre-half to play the enforcer role in front of Kyle Bartley and a returning Ahmed Hegazi, but Ajayi has been performing well in defence.</p>
      <p>That leaves a potential defensive midfield pairing of Filip Krovinic and Chris Brunt, perhaps the closest to like-for-like replacements – though without the legs of Livermore and Sawyers.</p>
      <p>Whatever formation Bilic opts for though, the boss will know it will have a huge impact on whether Baggies remain in front of, or become part of, the chasing pack by tomorrow evening.</p>
      <p>And Wednesday boss Garry Monk believes Albion deserve to be at the summit.</p>
      <p>“There’s no denying that they’re the best team in the league so far,” said the former Blues boss. “They’ve got huge quality throughout their squad, their threats are huge.</p>
      <p>“They have an array of talent in the squad and the manager has come in and done a fantastic job. He’s had a great start with them.</p>
      <p>“Any away game is difficult, particularly against the top of the league, but these are the challenges. We’re looking forward to it, the players are looking forward to it.</p>
      <p>“Judging by the way they’ve been for the two weeks we’ve been together, we want to show that. It’s going to be a really good test for us, they’re going to test every part of our physicality, mentality, how far we’ve come.</p>
      <p>“It’s not just about Saturday, it’s about the next two or three months, but it starts on Saturday and we look forward to it.”</p>
