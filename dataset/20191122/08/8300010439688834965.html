      <p>ORANGE, Calif. (KABC) -- A Southern California family is fighting for their child's life and at the same time trying to protect their credit information.<br/><br/>Their son has been diagnosed with leukemia, but when the family tried to move closer to the hospital for his treatments, they were scammed.<br/><br/>From his playfulness, it might be hard to tell 14-month-old Marq Jones is sick.<br/><br/>"He's doing good," said the child's mother JoAnna Jones. "Every day, he's getting a little better and a little stronger."<br/><br/>Marq, known as Baby Q to his family, has spent more than a month at Children's Hospital of Orange County undergoing chemotherapy after being diagnosed with leukemia.<br/><br/>"This is six to nine months at least minimum of chemo because it can come back at any time," said JoAnna. "You never know if it's gone."<br/><br/>His mother and his father Marc wanted to find a new home after the diagnosis.<br/><br/>They say their apartment in San Pedro - undergoing retrofitting - is no longer suitable for Baby Q, who has a weakened immune system. It's also too far away from the hospital.<br/><br/>"If he gets sick even remotely, it's an automatic emergency room," JoAnna said.<br/><br/>They say they thought they found their dream home in Long Beach after seeing an ad on Craigslist -- a 3 bedroom/2 bath home for $2,230 a month.<br/><br/>"I told my wife, 'OK, go for it. Let's send in the information,'" Marc Jones said.<br/><br/>They say they provided their financial information on the application.<br/><br/>Marc and their 4-year-old daughter even visited the place, but then a friend started looking into it.<br/><br/>"And the realtor was like, 'No, this house is in escrow. These people have nothing to do with this house at all," JoAnna said.<br/><br/>The Jones say they quickly froze their accounts to try to protect themselves against identity fraud. Now they're back to square one.<br/><br/>Their friends and family set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/baby-q-amp-family-fight-leukemia?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet">GoFundMe page</a> to try to raise enough money to move into a suitable home - all for Baby Q.<br/><br/>Marc and JoAnna say they need to find a home in the next three weeks. That's when Baby Q is expected to be released from the hospital.</p>
