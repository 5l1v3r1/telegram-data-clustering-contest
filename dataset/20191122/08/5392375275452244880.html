      <p>A lot of popular Android apps are filled with dangerous security holes<br/>4 (80%) 4 votes</p>
      <p>Popular Android apps, like Facebook and Instagram are full of serious security holes, CheckPoint reveals. According to the researchers, these applications available on the Google Play Store contain vulnerabilities that are several years old and have never been corrected. The firm accuses the developers of negligence.</p>
      <p>An obsolete code has been discovered in 19 popular and regularly updated <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Android">Android</a> apps on the Google Play Store, report Check Point’s cybersecurity experts. The developers of these applications have not deleted that code even years after the discovery of these vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p>By exploiting these breaches, a hacker would theoretically be able to execute malicious commands without the knowledge of the users. “Three security vulnerabilities, discovered more than two years ago, make hundreds of applications potentially vulnerable to remote code execution,” said Slava Makkaveev, IT security expert at <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2019/long-known-vulnerabilities-in-high-profile-android-applications/">Check Point</a>. “The user can not do much to protect his smartphone” regrets the expert.</p>
