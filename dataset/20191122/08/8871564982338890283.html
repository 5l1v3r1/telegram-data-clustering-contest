      <h1>Indonesian artisanal chocolate brand Krakakoa opens second store in Ubud</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:39:09+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bali" target="_blank">Coconuts Bali</a></address>
      <p>Indonesian artisanal chocolate brand Krakakoa, which was founded in 2013, is expanding its portfolio with a new shop in Ubud. Following its store debut in Seminyak last year, now the company hopes to introduce its range of cocoa products to visitors in one of Bali’s latest tourist hotspots. </p>
      <p>Did you know that Indonesia is the third largest producer of cocoa beans? As a company, Krakakoa prides itself for its work in empowering farmers, promoting sustainability and creating world-class quality products – rooted in the belief, it seems, that some of the best quality products in the world can indeed be produced right here in the archipelago. </p>
      <p>When it was first established in 2013 in Lampung, Sumatra, the brand was initially known as Kakoa. It rebranded itself in 2016, with “Krakakoa” being a play on the historic volcano, Krakatoa, as part of its aim to become known as a global Indonesian brand.  </p>
      <p>Today, that mission is ever-present in its chocolate bars, barks and cacao nibs, which are just a few of the items you can find in their stores. </p>

      <p>For its second location, located just steps away from the famous Ubud Monkey Forest, Krakakoa also offers daily fresh-made chocolate-based desserts, including brownies, chocolate chip cookies and chocolate cheesecakes. There’s a coffee bar available on site offering Indonesian specialty beans, which means you can get your morning caffeine fix or afternoon pick-me-up right here in the store. </p>
      <p>There’s also a mini-factory separated by a glass window in the Ubud shop, where you can take a peek at how Krakakoa chocolate is made from bean to bar. Those wishing for a more hands-on experience can also request for an interactive chocolate-making workshop, we’ve been told. </p>
