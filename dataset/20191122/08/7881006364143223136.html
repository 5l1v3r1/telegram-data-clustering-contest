      <p><b>New Delhi</b>: A Shiv Sena MLA on Thursday threatened to ‘smash the head’ of anybody who tried to poach his fellow representatives through bribery or blackmail, reported <i>News18</i>. The statement came amid finalisation of the alliance between Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena ahead of government formation in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>MLA Abdul Sattar, who represents the Sillod assembly constituency in Aurangabad district, warned former ally BJP against poaching or purchasing the elected representatives.</p>

      <p>“Our party is not some retail shop to buy MLAs from. If anybody tries to poach our MLAs, we will smash his head and break his legs too. However, the Sena will also summon an ambulance for the person and arrange for his medical treatment," he was quoted as saying by the <i>ANI</i>.</p>
      <p>The Congress and the NCP will hold talks with the Sena in Mumbai on Friday. On late Thursday night, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and his MLA-son Aaditya met Sharad Pawar in Mumbai after the NCP chief returned from Delhi. The meeting took place at Pawar's residence 'Silver Oak' in South Mumbai.</p>
