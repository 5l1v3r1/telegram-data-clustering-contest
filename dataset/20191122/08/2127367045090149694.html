      <p>Bangladesh skipper Mominul Haque won the toss and elected to bat in front of a sell-out Kolkata crowd for the first day-night Test in India on Friday. Both teams are playing their first pink-ball Test, four years after the innovation made its debut in Adelaide in 2015 to draw bigger crowds and TV audiences. Tickets are sold out for the first four days at Eden Gardens, in contrast to the sparse crowds that often watch day-time Tests in India. Monuments around Kolkata were lit up in pink for the occasion while a giant pink ball hovered over the 67,000-capacity stadium in the eastern Indian metropolis. The tourists have made two changes as they bid to bounce back from their drubbing in the opening Test of the two-match series. Al-Amin Hossain and Nayeem Hasan come into the side in place of Taijul Islam and Mehidy Hasan. Virat Kohli's India have made no changes to the XI that won the Indore Test inside three days.Â (<a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/live-scorecard/india-vs-bangladesh-2nd-test-kolkata-inba11222019190933">LIVE SCORECARD</a>)</p>
