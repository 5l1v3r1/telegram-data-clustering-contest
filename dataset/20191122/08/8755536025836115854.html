      <p>Rosanna Davison has shared some sweet new photos of her baby girl.</p>
      <p>The former Miss World and her husband Wes Quirke welcomed their first child via gestational surrogate on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Rosanna announced their baby’s arrival in a touching post on social media, and she’s since shared more photos of little Sophia.</p>
      <p>On her Instagram Story, the new mum shared a photo of Wes cradling their baby’s tiny legs.</p>

      <p>Rosanna also shared a boomerang of her cuddling her baby at 4am.</p>

      <p>Rosanna and Wes flew to an unknown country to welcome their daughter earlier this month.</p>
      <p><a href="http://goss.ie/showbiz/rosanna-davison-reveals-her-baby-is-due-today-190769">Their baby was originally due on November 15th</a>, but at the time, the couple said they felt they could be waiting a bit longer to meet their “little miracle.”</p>
      <p>Rosanna and Wes opted for surrogacy, after the model suffered multiple miscarriages.</p>

      <p>The former Miss World <a href="http://goss.ie/showbiz/rosanna-davison-reveals-she-blamed-herself-for-not-being-able-to-give-birth-190305">felt that she must be doing something wrong</a>, before she was diagnosed with an immune system disorder which explained why she had suffered miscarriages in the past.</p>
      <p>“Following medical advice, gestational surrogacy abroad became our only viable option for a biological child &amp; we’re so thankful for the wonders of modern medicine &amp; reproductive science,” she said.</p>
      <p>The couple will stay abroad with their little one for a few weeks, as they adjust to life as a family.</p>

      <p>During a recent interview with the Irish Mirror, Rosanna said: “We will stay there a few weeks I think, just because she will be brand new and we have to get her emergency passport and get various papers organised as well.”</p>
      <p>“But the nice thing is on her birth cert she is immediately ours, there is no mention of surrogacy, she’s an Irish citizen immediately so it has all worked out very well.”</p>
      <p>Congratulations to the happy couple!</p>
