      <p>A man has been found guilty of the murder of British backpacker <b>Grace Millane</b>, who disappeared a year ago in Auckland.</p>
      <p>A 27-year-old man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found guilty of strangling Grace to death in a hotel room on 1 December last year, <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/world/grace-millane-world-news-millane-killer-found-guilty-of-murder/3ea21c89-3ed9-45c2-936f-e27fc9800db0">9News</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Grace had matched with the accused on a dating app and had agreed to meet him on the night before her 22nd birthday.</p>
      <p>Her body was later found stuffed in a suitcase in bushland on the outskirts of Auckland.</p>
      <p>The accused will be sentenced on 21 February next year.</p>
      <p>“The verdict of murder today will be welcomed by every member of the Millane family and friends of Grace,” her father <b>David Millane </b>told reporters outside Auckland’s high court.</p>
      <p>“It will not reduce the pain and suffering we have had to endure over the past year.</p>
      <p>“Grace was taken in the most brutal fashion a year ago and our lives have been ripped apart.</p>
      <p>“Grace was our sunshine and she will be missed forever. She did not deserve to be murdered in such a barbaric way in her OE [gap] year.”</p>
      <p>He also thanked the NZ police, Detective Inspector <b>Scott Beard</b>, the Crown prosecution team, and the media.</p>
      <p>“Finally we want to thank the people of New Zealand. I can’t thank you enough for your kindness and for opening your hearts to us.”</p>
