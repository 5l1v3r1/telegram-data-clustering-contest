      <p><pic src="https://www.guru3d.com/news_teaserimage/14734"/>Radeon RX 5500 is to replace the RX-500 series and could become a price proposition that is interesting as for Full HD gaming, it's quite fast and likely well at a 150 USD marker.</p>
      <p>Website Heise from Germany had their hands on an OEM Radeon RX 5500 which you cannot buy. The video card in the test computer has 4 GB of video memory and corresponds to AMD's reference design. The Navi 14 based product uses the new RDNA architecture and is manufactured in 7 nm structure width. The GPU contains 1408 shaders, 32 rasterization and 88 texture units. The 4 or 8 GB GDDR6 (optional) memory runs at 1750 MHz and manages 224 GB/s over its 128-bit bus. In addition, Navi 14 offers PCIe 4.0 compatibility but is limited towards eight instead of 16 PCIe lanes.</p>

        <i>Test results from Heise</i>
      </p>
      <p>3DMark Fire Strike reached 12,111 points, while a factory-overclocked Sapphire RX 580 Nitro + scores 12,744 points. Close to the Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1660 OC from Nvidia at 12,525 points. Similarly, the numbers in Far Cry 5 look like where it goes from 72 fps (RX 5500) to 75 fps (RX 580 Nitro +) to 85 fps (GTX 1660 OC). As you can see, power consumption dropped dramatically as well. The Radeon RX 5500 seems to be able to keep up with Radeon RX 580, and at this price level that's not a bad thing. Pricing, however, remains trivial, you can pick up an RX 570 for under 150 USD these days.</p>
