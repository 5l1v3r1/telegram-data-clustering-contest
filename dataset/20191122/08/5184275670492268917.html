      </p>
      <p>Gaurang Chauhan: @TheJohnAbraham, @ArshadWarsi and @PulkitSamrat complement each other quite perfectly. @AnilKapoor is a scene stealer, @saurabhshukla_s is damn funny, @kriti_official surprises in an interesting role., @Ileana_Official is good and @UrvashiRautela is fine</p>

      <p>Shreyash Jain: Interval ! #Pagalpanti starts illogically but then makes you laugh smoothly, especially Arshad Warsi. The only problem is lengthy runtime which makes you bore after several laugh riots. Anees Bazmee is always a good director even in worst case he is decent. #PagalpantiReview</p>

      <p>Kabir Dev: #PagalpantiReview A brainless entertainer with a relevant message regarding big crony capitalists who run away after defaulting on loans with government compliance and support. Ahem even the name in the move of the defaulter is modi lol. #ChowkidarChorHai</p>
      <p>Sachin: Given that you judge a funny movie on basis of comedy, this movie had broken all its limits of @BazmeeAnees movies.Really enjoyed every part of film</p>
