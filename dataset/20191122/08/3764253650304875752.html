      <p>New Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho has ruled out his own club from much success this season in his very first media interaction since his appointment.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was in attendance at a press conference on Thursday, November 21, ahead of Tottenham’s trip to the London Stadium to take on Westham on Saturday, November 23.</p>

      <p>In an interaction that was highly anticipated by fans across the world, the Special One did not disappoint as he openly discussed a wide range of subjects, including what people should expect from the club this season.</p>
      <p>Spurs are currently in 14th place, a staggering 11 points from Manchester City in fourth, and Mourinho was quick to admit their title chances this season was pretty much none existent.</p>

      <p><i>“We will not fight for the title this year. But next season we will definitely try,” </i>he explained.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese also spoke on his previous stints where he was quick to admit that he might have made some mistakes in the way he handled problems and players.</p>
      <p>He, however, vowed to do things a bit differently at the Tottenham, saying he was ready to make “new mistakes”.</p>

        <i>"I realized I made mistakes and I'm not going to make the same mistakes.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“I'll make new mistakes - but not the same,"</i> he said.</p>
      <p>Efforts from journalists to get him to break down the mistakes he was talking about were fruitless.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was appointed new Spurs manager barely hours after the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Pochettino’s sacking, the new Spurs manager attempted to show some respect by saying the club will always be the Argentine’s home.</p>
      <p><i>"I have to congratulate him (Pochettino) on the incredible job he did. I share with you what we shared inside. This club will always be his home, this training ground his training ground. He is always welcome here," </i>he said.</p>
      <p>One interesting fact about Mourinho is that he has never managed a club for more than four years, in what fans have come to refer as the “Third Season Syndrome”.</p>
      <p>On whether joining Spurs was the right move, he tried to be politically correct by insisting he had joined a big football club with loads of quality and “structure”.</p>
      <p><i>“Deep inside, I’m very very happy and I know that my option is correct. I’m enjoying a big football club with great structure and organization. I’m really just focused on my job and players and not with everything that surrounds me,”</i> he said.</p>
      <p>Journalists would not let Mourinho leave without bringing up some of his old viral sentiments and the most popular one was his brutal words in 2015 where he dismissed the possibility of ever managing Spurs.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese in 2015 said he would never manage Tottenham because he had too much love for Chelsea but when asked what had changed in the years, he simply said, “I was sacked”.</p>
      <p>Mourinho also gave Spurs fans a reminder of his credentials by responding to a question about Tottenham losing the Champions League final last season with: <i>"I don't know because I never lost a Champions League final."</i></p>
