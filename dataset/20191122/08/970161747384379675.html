      <h1>TSB customers left without wages after latest IT glitch</h1>

      <p>Outraged TSB customers were deprived of their wages this morning after an IT outage at the bank delayed transfers into accounts.</p>
      <p>The bank announced on social media that ‘some payments’ had been held up overnight and said it is working to process them ‘as soon as possible today’.</p>
      <p>Customers can still make payments and withdraw money using their cards and can contact the bank directly if they need emergency cash.</p>
      <p>TSB tweeted: ‘We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and will ensure customers are not left out-of-pocket’.</p>
      <p>It comes after an investigation into an IT meltdown at TSB last year in which 2 million people were locked out of their accounts.</p>

      <p>The probe concluded the bank’s board of directors failed to show ‘common sense’ in the run up to a botched systems upgrade.</p>
      <p>But TSB’s former chief executive Paul Pester criticised the investigation’s ‘scattergun’ approach but conceded it showed its Spanish parent company Sabadell had ‘cut corners’ with IT testing.</p>
