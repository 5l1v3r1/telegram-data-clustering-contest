      <h1>Neil Harris may be the right manager at the wrong time for Cardiff City</h1>
      <h2>Our Bluebirds columnist has his say on Harris' appointment</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:52:46+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:52</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Johnson</a></address>
      <p>When Cardiff City clashed with Millwall during their promotion campaign, the match was billed as some sort of prehistoric encounter. Both sides were the opposite of the status quo, as more refined teams like Wolves and Fulham were passing the opposition to death.</p>
      <p>Cardiff and Millwall’s possession stats were instead amongst the lowest in the league, along with Bolton and Burton, who were both eventually relegated. They were the quickest at getting the ball forward with the fewest number of passes and also right up there in terms of offensive headers won.</p>
      <p>The subsequent game ended in a 1-1 draw and was a pulsating, intense affair, between two sides with formidable defences. The sorcerer failed to outwit his apprentice in either of their two games, as they also drew earlier in the season.</p>
      <p>Fast forward 18 months and Neil Warnock has stepped aside with Neil Harris chosen as his heir apparent. Whether or not he fits the bill probably depends on your criteria.</p>
      <p>Mehmet Dalman recently stated that Vincent Tan "wants somebody younger, an offensive-type of manager". If that was the remit, then it is hard to see how Harris meets it.</p>
      <p>Harris, like Warnock, often felt the need to defend his side’s style of play, once conceding: "We play like a Millwall team. Millwall fans do not want 30 or 40 passes in their own half, they want the ball forward in the opponents’ half." Does that sound like anyone you know?</p>
      <p>If Cardiff were looking for a Warnock replacement, then they nailed it.</p>
      <p>Harris was keen to stress that he is no Warnock clone at his unveiling, but if he wasn’t in the same vein, would he have got the job?</p>
      <p>Reports over the weekend claimed that Tony Pulis had turned down the post, pinning his hopes on a Premier League vacancy popping up in the coming weeks. I don’t fancy his chances, but if there is truth to the link, it further emphasises that an offensive manager was not really the focus of the search.</p>
      <p>I guess the obvious question is; if you’re going to hire someone so similar to Warnock, does he represent an upgrade? Are Cardiff more likely to challenge for promotion under Harris than they were under Warnock? We just don’t know yet, but there certainly appears to be some doubts amongst supporters.</p>

      <p>Everyone would admit that things had gone a bit stale under Warnock, but he may have turned things around in time. The hope now is that the introduction of Harris will have a galvanising effect and reboot Cardiff’s flagging fortunes. He certainly talked a good game in his first press conference.</p>
      <p>You sense that Harris appreciates what a great opportunity this is for him and is determined to succeed. He also gave the impression that he sets very high standards, which was good to hear because Cardiff are a bit softer these days than they once were.</p>
      <p>The difficulty lies in the fact that Harris is seen as a budget option. A modern Russell Slade. This is very harsh, but within the context of the other available options, there is at least a kernel of truth in the suggestion.</p>
      <p>The problem in these situations is that if you asked 10 people who they would like to see take charge, you would get a variety of answers, so you can’t please everyone. Having said that, not many were touting Harris and therein lies the problem.</p>
      <p>Craig Bellamy was the people's champion, as some were all too keen to forgive his baggage and past misdemeanours, but his recent history with the club made that virtually impossible.</p>
      <p>While people differed on the various options, most people seemed to be in agreement that an evolution in style was needed and the fear is that may not happen under Harris and that Cardiff will be left behind.</p>

      <p>You can go too far with that, as Cardiff have in the past, going from the functional style of Malky Mackay, to the cavalier Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, then back to basics with Slade. Revolution is rarely achievable, but evolution will be needed at some stage.</p>
      <p>For what it’s worth, I was hoping to see Chris Hughton, who has twice been promoted from the Championship and would represent a happy medium in terms of style of play, but despite an early link, he never really seemed to be in the running.</p>
      <p>Maybe they spoke to Hughton though, and your choice too, but they didn’t fancy it, or maybe the budget didn’t extend that far. You tend to get what you pay for though and if you glance up the table, you will find Slaven Bilic and Marcelo Bielsa in two of the top three spots. Proven winners usually win.</p>
      <p>The challenge now for Harris, on top of reviving Cardiff’s flagging fortunes and replacing a man that is nigh on irreplaceable, is shedding the stigma that he was the budget option. It feels like the club misjudged the mood to some extent, but the mood is already starting to shift.</p>
      <p>I admit that I was a little bit underwhelmed initially too, but I’m warming to the idea with every passing day. Harris is, after all, very much your typical Cardiff manager. He’s blood and guts, tough as old boots and expects the same from his players, as do the supporters.</p>
      <p>Harris is one of us now and will have the full backing of everyone. There may be scepticism though, but that is aimed at the club rather than him as there is a lot riding on them making the right decision. I’m rooting for him like everyone else, but, all things considered, I still wonder if he may be the right man at the wrong time.</p>
