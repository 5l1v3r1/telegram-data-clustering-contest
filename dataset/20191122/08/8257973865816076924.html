      <p>Nov. 22 (UPI) -- A New Zealand jury on Friday found a 27-year-old man guilty of killing a British backpacker who disappeared a year ago while on a Tinder date in Aukland.</p>
      <p>The jury deliberated for more than five hours before returning the unanimous<a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/117624172/grace-millane-trial-tinder-date-found-guilty-of-murdering-of-british-backpacker"> guilty verdict</a> as the man convicted of killing Grace Millane stood with his hands by his side. The accused, who cannot be named by court order, is to be sentenced Feb. 21.</p>
      <p>Millane's body <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2018/12/09/Body-found-in-search-for-British-backpacker-in-New-Zealand/2771544384319/?upi_ss=%22Grace+Millane%22">was found</a> Dec. 9 in a bush area of Waitakere nearly a week after she went missing following a date with the accused on Dec. 1, the eve of her 22nd birthday.</p>
      <p>The prosecution argued during the three-week trial that Millane was strangled to death while the accused said she died of a tragic accident, the product of rough sex at his apartment.</p>
      <p>Millane's parents, David and Gillian Millane, wept following the verdict.</p>
      <p>"The verdict of murder today will be welcomed by the members of the Millane family and friends of Grace," David <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/117650526/grace-millanes-family-welcomes-guilty-verdict-in-high-court-trial-of-her-killer">told reporters</a> while fighting back tears. "It will not reduce the pain, the suffering we've had to endure for over the past year."</p>
      <p>He said Millane was "a beautiful, talented, loving daughter."</p>
      <p>"Grace was our sunshine and she will be missed forever," he said. "She did not deserve to be murdered in such a barbaric way in her [overseas experience] year."</p>
      <p>Millane, 21, traveled to New Zealand last November from South America as part of a year-long trip around the world following college graduation. She was last seen with the accused in CCTV footage walking arm in arm into his apartment building.</p>
      <p>Her body was found over a week later stuffed into a suitcase and buried in a shallow grave.</p>
