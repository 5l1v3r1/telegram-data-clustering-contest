      <p>Google spinoff Waymo is trying to educate emergency responders on how to deal with its autonomous vehicles.</p>
      <p>Waymo released a training video on YouTube Thursday geared toward guiding public safety officials responding to incidents involving their self-driving cars.</p>
      <p>The 14-minute instructional video advises how to put a car in <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/manual+mode/">manual mode</a> and what precautions firefighters should take.</p>
      <p>The video was done in conjunction with Waymo engineers and suburban Phoenix police and firefighters.</p>
      <p>Waymo is among several companies that has been testing autonomous vehicle programs in Arizona.</p>
      <p>The video comes two days after the National Transportation Safety Board found a distracted human safety driver caused a fatal crash of an autonomous Uber car.</p>
      <p>The NTSB also condemned a lack of state and federal regulation of testing on <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/public+roads/">public roads</a>.</p>
