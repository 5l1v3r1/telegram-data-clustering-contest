      <p>A Derby school is closed today due to drainage issues caused by heavy rain.</p>
      <p>Grampian Primary Academy, in <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/sinfin">Grampian Way, Sinfin</a>, closed yesterday afternoon and will remain shut today.</p>
      <p>The school posted on Facebook yesterday asking parents to pick their children up "as quickly as possible" due to "great difficulty" with drainage after the heavy rainfall.</p>
      <p>They said: "Despite our efforts, we have a significant issue with the drains which means that we have had to close the main toilet block.</p>
      <p>"This difficulty is now extending throughout the other toilets in school."</p>
      <p>They later announced that the school and nursery would also be closed today , as they had been "unable to resolve the problem to a satisfactory standard".</p>
      <p>They said: "We apologise for the inconvenience we know this causes for our families. The decision to remain closed has not been an easy one."</p>
