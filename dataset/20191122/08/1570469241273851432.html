      <p>The teenager who gunned down two classmates at a <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/police-look-for-motive-behind-california-school-shooting-262348">California school</a> last week before shooting himself used a "kit gun" that is untraceable, authorities said Thursday.</p>
      <p>In a tweet, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said the so-called "ghost gun" used by <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/gunman-who-killed-fellow-classmates-in-california-dies-as-police-look-for-motive-262482">Nathaniel Berhow</a> was assembled from parts that do not have serial numbers.</p>
      <p>He said kit guns also are known as "80 per cent guns" - are sold at gun shows or can be purchased online, allowing owners to skirt California's gun laws.</p>
      <p>Ghost guns "are sold as a kit, and you can legally buy it, assemble the weapon yourself and you have a gun that is not registered and no one knows that you have it, it's very dangerous," Villanueva told ABC7.</p>
      <p>The sheriff added in a statement that it was unclear who assembled the .45-caliber pistol used by Berhow last Thursday during his rampage at Saugus High School, a short commute from <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/california-firefighters-tackle-blazes-in-suburbs-of-los-angeles-258238">Los Angeles</a>.</p>
      <p>Two fellow students were killed and several others were injured before Berhow, who had turned 16 that day, shot himself in the head. He died a day later.</p>
      <p>Authorities are still trying to piece together what prompted the shooting, especially as Berhow had no history of troubling behaviour.</p>
      <p>Villanueva said Berhow's father had six registered guns that were lawfully removed from the home and subsequently destroyed. A later search turned up the "kit gun."</p>
      <p>The sheriff said investigators are looking at Berhow's electronic communication in the hope it will shed light on his motive.</p>
