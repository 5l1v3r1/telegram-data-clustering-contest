      <p>Former footballer Ian told how he owed £2million in tax and he was "at the mercy" of HMRC in 2016.</p>
      <p>The former Arsenal striker is rumoured to be taking home £400,000 from ITV for starring on the reality show.</p>
      <p>In Ian Wright, A Life In Football: My Autobiography, he wrote: “The only serious clouds in those skies is the income tax issues that have been with me for a while now.”</p>
      <p>Harry Redknapp's BFF blamed the “wave of financial advisers” which appeared in the 1990s for landing a “whole generation of footballers” in trouble over tax.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’m not a tax fraud, I am not a tax cheat, but at the moment I am at the complete mercy of the HM Revenue &amp; Customs because of things that happened back then.</p>
      <p>“The fact that it was bad advice and probably some financial skulduggery is not their concern; they want to get paid and my name is on the bill.”</p>
      <p>Wright claimed he owned eight or nine properties at one stage but due to his tax issues he is now left with just one, which he first bought for his mum.</p>
      <p>He added: “One after another, the taxmen were coming for me over my former properties because of something called ‘deferred tax’, which, essentially, means it hasn’t been paid.</p>
      <p>"I put my trust in people who for 20-odd years didn’t give me the advice I should have got. I’ll be paying for that for a long time.”</p>
      <p>Several accountants advised him to declare himself bankrupt but he refused as he believed it would end his pundit career.</p>

      <p>Cliff said upfront the reason he was doing I'm A Celeb was because he had an unexpected lump sum money from the tax man to pay off.</p>
      <p>Ahead of his jungle stint, he didn't share how much the cash he owed.</p>
      <p>The EastEnders actor dropped the bombshell he did a huge U-turn after originally refusing to go on the reality show.</p>
      <p>It is not known how much Cliff is being paid to participate in I'm A Celeb.</p>
      <p>Asked why he was going on the show, he told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/">The Sun</a> : "The taxman. Yeah, I have got a bill I need to pay. Like everyone at this time of year you go, 'Oh no! Again. I thought I paid that.</p>
      <p>"I had a meeting about this earlier on in the year and I thought about it long and hard and said no and then as it crept along to September and I got an estimate for my tax I phoned them up and said 'is it too late to say yes?' So here I am.</p>
      <p>"I give myself a bit of a talking to, and then I spoke to the accountant and he made my mind up."</p>
