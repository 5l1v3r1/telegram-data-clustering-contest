      <p>Below, a look at Phil Lynott, the frontman of Thin Lizzy, and his fascinating life.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Where was Phil Lynott born?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Philip Parris Lynott was born to <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/culture/entertainment/thin-lizzy-phil-lynott-mother-died">Philomena Lynott</a>, a white Irish Catholic, and Cecil Parris, a Brazilian, in West Bromwich, near Birmingham, in the United Kingdom on August 20, 1949.</p>
      <p>As a child, Lynott lived in Moss Side in Manchester before moving to live with his grandparents in Crumlin, Dublin while he was still in school. Later, Lynott lived in Clontarf as an adult.</p>
      <p>Though he was born in the UK, Lynott is remembered as a proud Irish man. In a 2013 interview, Thin Lizzy guitarist Scott Gorham told <a href="https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/life-after-lizzy-29817116.html">The Irish Independent</a>: "Phil was so proud of being Irish. No matter where he went in the world, if we were talking to a journalist and they got something wrong about Ireland, he'd give the guy a history lesson. It meant a lot to him."</p>

        <b>How was Thin Lizzy formed?</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the Thin Lizzy <a href="http://www.thinlizzy.org/phil.html">website</a>, Phil Lynott joined the group The Black Eagles as the lead vocalist when he was a teen living in Dublin. Brian Downey, whom Lynott was friends with at the Christian Brothers School in Crumlin, played drums for the band.</p>
      <p>After The Black Eagles, Lynott joined up with Skid Row, who was headed by Brush Sheils. Around that time, Lynott first began to learn how to play the bass. In 1968, Belfast native Gary Moore replaced the guitarist in Skid Row and later that year the band released their first independent single “New Faces, Old Places.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Sheils opted to reform Skid Row as a three-piece group, which led Lynott to exit and form his own band Orphanage which featured Brian Downey on the drums, Pat Quigley on bass, and Joe Staunton on guitar. The group wrote and performed original material. Downey later said: “Quite a few of the melodies that ended up on the first Lizzy album were being thrown around in Orphanage.”</p>
      <p>In the later part of 1969, Orphanage was approached by guitarist Eric Bell who suggested the formation of a new band with Lynott, Downey again on drums, and Eric Wrixon on keyboards. This gave way to the first configuration of Thin Lizzy. Wrixon exited the band later in 1970, followed by Bell in 1973. In the following years, the roster changed.</p>

        <b>Did Phil Lynott have children?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Phil Lynott had two daughters with his wife Caroline Crowther: Sarah, born in 1978, and Cathleen, born in 1980. Phil and Caroline’s marriage fell apart after only about four years due to his escalated drug use.</p>
      <p>In 1968, Lynott gave up his first son for adoption. In 2003, Galway-based sculptor Macdaragh Lambe came forward claiming to be Lynott’s son, which Lynott’s mother Philomena later <a href="https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/lynott-sons-joy-as-phils-family-recognise-him-26666547.html">confirmed to be true in 2010</a>.</p>

        <b>What books did Phil Lynott write?</b>

      <p>In 1977, the second volume of Lynott’s poetry was published entitled simply “Philip.” </p>
      <p>In 1997, the two initial volumes of Lynott’s poetry were printed as one edition, again entitled “Songs for While I’m Away."</p>
