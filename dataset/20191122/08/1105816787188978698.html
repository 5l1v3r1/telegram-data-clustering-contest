      <p><b>WASHINGTON: </b>A Chinese national and former Monsanto employee has been charged with industrial espionage and stealing trade secrets, US officials said.</p>
      <p>Haitao Xiang was arrested in June 2017 at an airport with a one-way ticket to China and in possession of software developed by the American agribusiness giant to help farmers improve crop yields, the Department of Justice said on Thursday in a statement.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old had worked at Monsanto and its subsidiary The Climate Corporation for nearly 10 years.</p>
      <p>The indictment alleges another instance of the Chinese government encouraging “employees to steal intellectual property from their US employers”, Assistant Attorney General John Demers said.</p>
      <p>Xiang faces up to 15 years in jail and a $5 million fine for each of the three counts of espionage against him, along with hefty jail terms and fines for three counts of theft of trade secrets.</p>
