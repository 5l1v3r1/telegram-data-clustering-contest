      <p>As reported in the past months, the Buccaneers were showing keen interest in the services of the Bidvest Wits defender.</p>

      <p>However, according to the player, when he was heavily linked to the Soweto side, there was never really any negotiations which took place between the parties concerned.</p>
      <p>“In a nutshell, it was only a verbal approach and there was never something concrete whereby they have placed a price and (held) negotiations and so on,” the 29-year-old defender said.</p>
      <p>“They never made an approach to us that is worth it. And, yes, I could see how much Wits value me and I value them as a team and they approached me to add another year to my contract. I could see on social media how much the Pirates fans want me, but up there they never made any approach,” he added.</p>
