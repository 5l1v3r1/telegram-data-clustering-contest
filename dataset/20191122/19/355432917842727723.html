      <h1>Trump says drug importation plan coming 'soon'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:46:09+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/nathaniel-weixel" target="_blank">Nathaniel Weixel</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> on Friday said he will “soon” be releasing a plan to allow the U.S. to import prescription drugs from abroad.</p>
      <p>“[Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar] and I will soon release a plan to let Florida and other States import prescription drugs that are MUCH CHEAPER than what we have now! Hard-working Americans don’t deserve to pay such high prices for the drugs they need. We are fighting DAILY to make sure this HAPPENS,” Trump tweeted.</p>

      <p>Trump did not offer any details, and the Department of Health and Human Services declined to comment. A final rule that would allow states to import certain drugs from Canada has been under regulatory review at the White House Office of Management and Budget since Nov. 1.</p>
      <p>The rule would allow pharmacists and wholesalers to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the U.S. if they meet conditions designed to ensure that the importation poses no additional risk to safety, and will save money.</p>
      <p>The administration’s blessing could pave the way for states such as Vermont, Florida, Colorado and Maine to begin drug importation. All of those states have passed laws that would allow the importation of prescription drugs from across the northern border.</p>
      <p>Prescription drugs are cheaper in Canada, as in most other countries, because the government can directly negotiate the price with drug companies.</p>
      <p>“While we had the first prescription drug price decrease in 50 years, Americans still pay far too much for drugs — other countries pay far less — that is WRONG! We will soon be putting more options on the table,” Trump tweeted.</p>

      <p>Trump has made lowering drug prices a priority, and if an importation plan is successful, he could cite it as a major policy victory in a key battleground state going into the 2020 presidential election.</p>
      <p>But even with the White House on board, the states will need to overcome hurdles, starting with the massive lobbying effort by the drug industry.</p>
      <p>To date, almost every administrative effort on drug pricing has been blocked in court or been withdrawn in the face of opposition.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Trump on Friday tweeted opposition to sweeping drug pricing legislation in the House from Speaker <a href="https://thehill.com/people/nancy-pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a> (D-Calif.) that would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices.</p>
      <p>Trump expressed support for drug pricing efforts by House Republicans, but there is currently no comprehensive House GOP plan. </p>
      <p>Instead, members support measures like the Creates Act, a smaller bipartisan bill aimed at lowering drug prices by cracking down on delay tactics that drug companies use to fend off competition from cheaper generic drugs.</p>
      <p>A White House spokesman has previously said Trump supports a bipartisan Senate bill from Sens. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/chuck-grassley">Chuck Grassley</a> (R-Iowa) and <a href="https://thehill.com/people/ron-wyden">Ron Wyden</a> (D-Ore.). But it’s unlikely to see floor action before the end of the year, as many Republicans still oppose it. Majority Leader <a href="https://thehill.com/people/mitch-mcconnell">Mitch McConnell</a> (R-Ky.) has also declined to support it. </p>
