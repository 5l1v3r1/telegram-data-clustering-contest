      <h1>Schumer backs Working Families Party in shot at Cuomo</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:58:35+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:58</time> by <a rel="author">Bernadette Hogan and Carl Campanile</a></address>
      <p>Powerful Sen. Chuck Schumer threw a brushback pitch Friday at Gov. Andrew Cuomo and his close ally — state Democratic Party chairman Jay Jacobs — for pushing new rules that could kill off the Working Families Party.</p>
      <p>“The Public Financing Commission should focus on the worthy goal of reducing BIG money in politics, not ending fusion voting and the@NYWFP,” Schumer <a href="https://twitter.com/chuckschumer/status/1197896141393801217">said in a tweet</a>.</p>
      <p>“The WFP helps Democrats in tight seats win races, especially in the House. I’ve worked with the WFP for progressive policies like increased minimum wage, family leave, and passing the groundbreaking Climate and Community Protection Act in New York.”</p>
      <p>Currently, minor parties must obtain 50,000 votes every four years in the governor’s race to maintain ballot status or go out of business.</p>
      <p>Jacobs — a Cuomo appointee on the panel — has proposed tripling the threshold for ballot status to nearly 150,000 votes, which could kill off the WFP.</p>
      <p>The proposal <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/29/warren-slams-cuomo-ally-state-dems-for-efforts-to-take-down-third-parties/">drew condemnation</a> from presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, who is backed by the WFP.</p>
      <p>Schumer’s salvo reveals a rare public rift between the two most powerful Democrats in Albany and Washington.</p>
      <p>The top Democrat in the U.S. Senate rarely ventures into Albany’s machinations, where Cuomo reigns — and has long battled the WFP.</p>
      <p>But that contentious relationship didn’t stop Cuomo and Lt. Kathy Hochul from taking the WFP line in November 2018 election, which netted them 114,478 votes.</p>
      <p>The progressive party was created by lefty activists and labor union leaders in 1998.</p>
      <p>It typically backs Democratic candidates in the general election but earned Cuomo’s ire for supporting insurgent candidates in Democratic primaries.</p>
      <p>In 2014, the WFP threatened to backed little known lefty lawyer activist Zephyr Teachout, who challenged Cuomo in the Democratic primary.</p>
      <p>Cuomo <a href="https://nypost.com/2014/06/13/working-families-party-urging-liberals-to-support-cuomo/">prevailed and got the WFP nomination</a> after arm-twisting on his behalf by Mayor Bill de Blasio and labor leaders who help bankroll the party.</p>
      <p>The relationship hit the rocks last year when the <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/04/13/cuomo-campaign-gives-up-on-winning-working-families-party-endorsement/">WFP endorsed Cynthia Nixon</a> in the Democratic primary race.</p>
      <p>After Cuomo won the primary, the WFP begrudgingly <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/10/05/cuomo-agrees-to-run-on-working-families-party-line/">offered Cuomo its ballot line in the generation election</a> — in what amounted to a shotgun wedding.</p>
      <p>Cuomo frequently denies that he’s out for the WFP or fusion voting, noting he’s run on the WFP, the Independence Party and other lines for all his elections.</p>
      <p>His office referred The Post to prior answers the governor has given on the WFP and fusion voting, steered questions about Schumer’s broadside to Jacobs, his appointee on the public campaign financing commission.</p>
      <p>“Well, I’ve run on fusion voting in every election. So if I didn’t support it, I couldn’t do it,” Cuomo said earlier this month.</p>
      <p>“Let’s see what the commission comes up with. I wouldn’t advocate ending it because I have done it continually as a practice. If I didn’t believe in it, I wouldn’t have done it,” Cuomo added. “It would be like you saying you don’t support journalism. It would be hard for you to say that now.”</p>
      <p>Jacobs said he’s not surprised that Schumer is defending the WFP as have many other elected Democrats because of the influence the minor party has. But that precisely proves his point, Jacobs said.</p>
      <p>“It’s the tail wagging the dog,” Jacobs said.</p>
      <p>He also said he wants to make sure “taxpayer dollars are not being misspent” in a new public campaign financing system. The commission is considering proposals to provide public matching funds for candidates who agree to accept smaller contributions from individual donors.</p>
