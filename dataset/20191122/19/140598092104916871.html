      <h1>Ascot hosts clash of the decade between Altior and Cyrname</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:23:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/marcus-armytage/" target="_blank">Marcus Armytage</a></address>
      <p>Since Queen Anne noticed a clearing in Windsor Great Park and decided it would be a good spot for a racecourse, just over 300 years ago, Ascot has been the scene some of the best races ever run on the Flat.</p>
      <p>But rarely has it hosted a jump race as eagerly anticipated as <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/racing/2019/11/18/altior-andcyrname-face-ascot-saturday-christy-1965-chase/">Saturday’s Christy 1965 Chase</a>, in which Altior and Cyrname, the two top-rated chasers in Britain, go head-to-head in arguably the biggest heavyweight clash the winter game has witnessed since Denman and Kauto Star lined up in the 2008 Gold Cup.</p>
      <p>It is fitting that they meet in the race which celebrates the year jump racing was introduced to Ascot, and if it lives up to the hype it has the potential to be one of the best staged here. Indeed, even if it is only half as good as the 1989 Victor Chandler Chase, when Desert Orchid beat Panto Prince on the line, it will still be a classic.</p>
      <p>But ever since Cyrname affronted Altior fans by posting a higher rating when beating Waiting Patiently 17 lengths over course and distance last February; and trainer Nicky Henderson announced his intention to step up Altior (unbeaten in 19 starts over obstacles) in trip this season; this meeting has been the match racing has been waiting for.</p>
      <p>Altior, with form which looks like someone fell asleep on the “1” button of their keyboard, the thick end of £1.25 million in the bank, the bigger following and the most to lose, is likely to be sent off a narrow favourite ahead of Cyrname.</p>

      <p>But, while my heart says Altior, my head is telling me Cyrname, which gets the trip, will seek to exploit any stamina issues in the champion two-miler, and will be fit to run for his life first time out.</p>
      <p>At the back of Henderson’s mind will be the rest of Altior’s season. In thoroughbreds, as in human athletes, there is a simple equation – more speed equals less stamina and vice versa – and the clear worry for Henderson is that if Altior has been showing such a turn of foot, when push comes to shove he may not quite have the stamina.</p>
      <p>“It’ll sort one thing out, which is the top-rated horse,” Henderson said. “It’s a fascinating clash. It’s a big ask because of the step up in trip. If you saw his work last Friday he doesn’t look like a horse who’ll stay, but Nico [de Boinville] has always been adamant he’ll stay. I hope he relaxes and let’s hope it lives up to its billing.”</p>
      <p>Cyrname’s trainer, Paul Nicholls, more bullish by nature, has no such worries. “I’m looking forward to it,” he said. “It’s always been the target, he had a great prep, we took him to Wincanton for a gallop, which we’ve never been able to do before, and he was awesome.”</p>
      <p>He puts Cyrname’s sudden improvement half way through last season down to maturity. “He was not breathing in his races and I think he was trying to do it all on one breath,” he said.</p>
      <p>“A year ago we wouldn’t have been able to take him to Wincanton, but after his first two runs something suddenly clicked. I’m confident those last two starts weren’t flashes in the pan. I see the difference in him at home although, of course, it is in the back of your mind he has to go and do it again, but I’m confident he’s in serious order.” The third runner, the 66-1 shot Solomon Grey, is better than his last but not good enough to trouble either of these.</p>
      <p>Despite having to play second fiddle to Ascot’s clash of the titans, the Betfair Chase at Haydock is equally fascinating in its own way.</p>
      <p>Colin Tizzard’s Lostintranslation is the rave horse for the Gold Cup, but it would be no disgrace to lose to course specialist Bristol De Mai, who goes for a third Betfair today.</p>
      <p>However, it is no two-horse contest, with Frodon also a serious player after a nice pipe-opener earlier this month, while Charlie Hall winner Ballyoptic is not out of it.</p>
