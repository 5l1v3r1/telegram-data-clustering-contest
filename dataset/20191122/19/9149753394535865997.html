      <p>This Friday is not Black Friday, which is next Friday, but apparently this Friday is close enough for the gang at the Epic Games Store, which kicked off its <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/collection/november-2019-sale">Black Friday Sale</a> today with discounts of up to 75 percent, and decent deals on some big names including Red Dead Redemption, The Outer Worlds, Borderlands 3, and a pile of others.</p>
      <p>I was a little surprised yesterday when RDR2 was given a 20 percent cut in the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/red-dead-redemption-2-and-the-outer-worlds-are-on-sale-in-the-humble-store-fall-sale/">Humble Fall Sale</a> because it's a mega-hit game that's only been on PC for a couple of weeks, but the same discount applies on the Epic Store—$48 for the <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/red-dead-redemption-2/home">standard edition</a>, or slightly more for the Special and Ultimate editions. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/the-outer-worlds/home">The Outer Worlds</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/borderlands-3/home">Borderlands 3</a> are also marked down, to $45 (25 percent) and $40 (33 percent) respectively, and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/ancestors/home">Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey</a>, the evolution RPG from Assassin's Creed co-creator Patrice Désilets that came out in August, is already down to half price—$20—which I'm sorry to say <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ancestors-the-humankind-odyssey-review/">doesn't surprise me</a> much at all.</p>
      <p>A few other Deals As Chosen By Me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/metro-exodus/home">Metro Exodus</a> - $20 (50 percent off)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/what-the-golf/home">What the Golf?</a> - $13 (35 percent off)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/stories-untold/home">Stories Untold</a> - $2.50 (75 percent off)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/world-of-goo/home">World of Goo</a> - $4 (75 percent off)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/surviving-mars/home">Surviving Mars</a> - $10 (66 percent off)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It's a relatively small sale, at least compared to the typical Steam behemoths (we expect the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/steam-sale-dates/">Steam Fall Sale</a> to start next week, by the way), but EGS is a relatively small store, and obviously there's quite a bit more to see and throw money at—all the Jackbox Party Packs are on sale, for instance, from $12 to $22. And honestly, 20 bucks for Metro Exodus is a pretty sweet deal.</p>
      <p>The Epic Games Store Black Friday Sale runs until December 2. For a deep assortment of other cool stuff to throw your money at, keep your eyes on our running list of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday deals</a> for 2019.</p>
