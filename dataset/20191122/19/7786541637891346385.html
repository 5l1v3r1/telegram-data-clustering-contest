      <p><b>BELLEFONTE, Pa.Â (AP)</b> - The Latest on the resentencing of former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky (all times local):</p>
      <p>2:45 p.m.</p>
      <p>Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky has been given the same penalty at his resentencing as before: 30 to 60 years in prison.</p>
      <p>Centre County Judge Maureen Skerda sentenced the 75-year-old Sandusky on Friday at the courthouse in Bellefonte (BEL'-fahnt).</p>
      <p>Sandusky was convicted of 45 counts of child sexual abuse in 2012 and sentenced to 30 to 60 years.</p>
      <p>An appeals court said laws mandating sentence minimums in place at the time of his October 2012 sentencing had since changed.</p>
      <p>Sandusky again asserted his innocence Friday. He choked up twice in brief remarks to the judge and told his supporters he loves them.</p>

      <p>Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky has arrived at a Pennsylvania courthouse to be resentenced.</p>
      <p>The 75-year-old Sandusky smiled as he was escorted into Centre County Court on Friday in Bellefonte (BELL'-font) with his hands handcuffed in front of him and carrying papers.</p>
      <p>When a reporter asked him whether he maintains his innocence, he responded with, "absolutely."</p>
      <p>Sandusky was convicted of 45 counts of child sexual abuse in 2012 and sentenced to 30 to 60 years.</p>
      <p>An appeals court said mandatory minimum sentences had been improperly applied against him.</p>
      <p>Court filings in recent weeks indicate that there may be arguments about Sandusky's designation as a sexually violent predator.</p>

      <p>Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky is expected in a Pennsylvania courtroom to be resentenced after an appeals court said mandatory minimum sentences had been improperly applied against him.</p>
      <p>The 75-year-old Sandusky will be resentenced Friday by Judge Maureen Skerda at the county courthouse in Bellefonte.</p>
      <p>State Superior Court in February rejected many of Sandusky's arguments but determined the sentencing was flawed.</p>
      <p>Sandusky was convicted of 45 counts of child sexual abuse in 2012 and sentenced to 30 to 60 years. It's unclear whether Skerda will issue a significantly different sentence.</p>
      <p>Court filings in recent week indicate that there may also be argument about Sandusky's designation as a sexually violent predator.</p>
