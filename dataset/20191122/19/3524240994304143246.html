      <h1>Vice Chancellors not against IPPIS —FUAM’s VC, Kimbir</h1>

      <p>The Vice Chancellor, Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi, Prof. Richard Kimbir, has denied that vice chancellors were against the enrollment of staff on the Integrated Payroll and Personal Information System.</p>
      <p>Kimbir stated this on Friday in Makurdi in a news briefing to mark his second anniversary in office.</p>
      <p>He said it was staff unions, especially Association of University Unions that were against the enrollment.</p>
      <p>He said VC’s were not in control of university funds.</p>
      <p>“It is not correct that vice chancellors are against IPPIS. It is the unions especially ASUU that are against it and they have given reasons as to why they don’t want it.</p>
      <p>“They are talking of some peculiarities that may not go down well if we join IPPIS and I think the Accountant General of the Federation is discussing the issue with them.</p>
      <p>“It is also not correct that VCs are employing new staff to cover their wage bill as a result of the IPPIS issue. For you to employ now, you need permission from the Federal Character Commission and other processes. The money is not with us but CBN. We don’t control university monies now,” he said.</p>
