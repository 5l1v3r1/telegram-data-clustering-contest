      <p>Christmas food is one of the best things about the festive season.</p>
      <p>You can't have a dinner without pigs in blankets and it's not <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> without a mince pie.</p>
      <p>But what about having them deep fried in batter?</p>
      <p>It might sound like a fishy idea, but that's exactly what Copperfish in Mumbles Pier in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea">Swansea</a> has just started doing.</p>
      <p>Mumbles Pier general manager Hannah Hunter reckons you can batter any food.</p>
      <p>"We had battered Creme eggs at Easter and they went down well which is why we decided to sell mince pies and pigs in blankets," she said.</p>
      <p>"We started selling the battered mince pies last Sunday and people have been divided. There's been a mixed reaction. A lot of people want them but some people will say that they can't put that in their mouth.</p>
      <p>The battered mince pies cost £1.10 and the pigs in blanket cost £1.70. Both are dipped in flour and batter before being deep fried.</p>
      <p>But what do they really taste like? I tried them both out to find out.</p>

      <h3>The verdict</h3>
      <p>My first impression of a battered mince pie was that it would, quite frankly, be disgusting. The thought of eating the sweet festive treat covered in batter made me feel slightly sick at first.</p>
      <p>It felt wrong mixing the batter with a mince pie and cream, which is served on the side but, after taking my first bite, I was pleasantly surprised.</p>
      <p>The coating was fresh and crispy and enveloped the warm pie which had a generous filling but after a couple of bites I couldn't eat any more.</p>

      <p>Was it the best thing I have ever tasted? No. Would I order it again? No. But I was prepared for it to taste a lot worse than what it actually did. That being said though, while I wasn't a fan, my photographer definitely was - who had gobbled his battered mince pie faster than you could say "cheese".</p>
      <p>However, the chippy's festive version of pigs in blankets, definitely sounded more appealing. I mean, after all, a battered sausage at a chippy is always a good idea.</p>
      <p>The pork sausage came wrapped in rashers of streaky bacon and was then coated in the signature batter and was served with gravy and cranberry sauce - the perfect combo.</p>
      <p>I definitely preferred this to the mince pie.</p>
