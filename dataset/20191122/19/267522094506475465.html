      <p>What will you be looking for in the <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/best-black-friday-cyber-monday-uk-deals-update-nov-20">Black Friday deals</a> this year? If you're planning to get a new electrical item – perhaps a coffee machine, a 4K TV or even a dishwasher or fridge – then AO.com is a retailer you should keep an eye on.</p>
      <p>Black Friday lands on November 29 this year but AO.com doesn't wait until then to start bringing out the bargains. Read on to discover our pick of the AO.com Black Friday deals.</p>
      <h3>When is the AO.com Black Friday sale?</h3>
      <p>The AO.com Black Friday sale is on NOW. It kicked off on Wednesday 13 November and while we don't have an official end date for the sale, we assume it will run right the way through until AO.com's <a href="https://ao.com/help-and-advice/upcoming-events/what-is-cyber-monday">Cyber Monday deals</a>, which will run on 2 December 2019, and probably beyond as AO.com says "Here at AO.com, we like to be generous, so we’ll be offering deals before and after Black Friday, too. Just in time to grab a Christmas bargain!"</p>
      <p>In 2018 AO.com started its Black Friday sale a whole two weeks of Black Friday so this year's Black Friday sale follows a similar pattern.</p>

      <h3>How can you get the best AO.com Black Friday deals</h3>
      <p>AO.com has supplied four tips to help you get the best Black Friday deals. These tips don't just apply to AO.com, though, they apply to all retailers. Here they are:</p>
      <p><b>1: Do your research.</b> To ensure you get the best possible deal on the day, make a list of the items you’d ideally like to buy, prioritise them and stick to your list. This means you won’t overspend but you can still purchase everything you need.</p>
      <p><b>2: Sign up. </b>Register for online accounts with retailers ahead of the event so you can be the first to know about the best deals around. Most retailers offer a sign-up service so that you can enter your email address and be notified when the Black Friday deals go live.</p>
      <p><b>3: Get on the retailer’s apps and social media. </b>Follow the retailers you want to hear about for their upcoming discounts and offers during Black Friday. Also, download their app and set up a notification so you are aware of any new deals that launch. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/ao">follow AO.com on Twitter</a>, and download the <a href="https://ao.com/my-ao-app">My AO app</a> for iOS and Android.</p>
      <p><b>4: Timing is everything. </b>Due to the large volume of visitors some websites crashed before customers could grab their bargain last year. Be ahead of the game and shop at times that would be typically quieter to avoid this risk.</p>
