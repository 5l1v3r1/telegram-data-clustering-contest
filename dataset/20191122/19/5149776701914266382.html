      <h1>Derby County boss Phillip Cocu has his say on Feyenoord links</h1>
      <h2>The Rams head coach has only been in place since July after replacing Frank Lampard and has suffered consecutive derby defeats at Forest so far this term</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Derby County manager Phillip Cocu has refuted claims he could be set to leave Pride Park and return to his native Holland.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/could-nottingham-forests-arch-rivals-3547231">Cocu has been linked with a move to Feyenoord</a> at the end of the season replacing former Rangers boss Dick Advocaat who will depart De Kuip in the summer at the age of 72.</p>
      <p>Frank Arnesen, formerly of Chelsea has been appointed as the club’s new sporting director and worked with <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/deserved-more-phillip-cocu-reflects-3520743">Cocu</a> at PSV Eindhoven, a relationship which has seen Dutch media suggest the Rams boss could be on his way just a year into his four-year deal to link up with Arnesen.</p>
      <p>"I read it myself, but it is typical rumours in football,” Cocu said <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-phillip-cocu-feyenoord-3563410">when quizzed on the reports</a> at his pre-match press conference.</p>
      <p>"It is, for me, no discussion.</p>

      <p>"I am happy here and I have a contract here, so it is just a rumour from one side, but not from my side.</p>
      <p>“I will stay here."</p>
      <p>The Rams are currently 16th in the Championship after losing 1-0 at fierce rivals Nottingham Forest before the international break, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-boss-philip-cocu-3256772">their second defeat at the City Ground this season</a>.</p>
      <p>This weekend, Cocu will hope his Rams side make it five straight wins at home by seeing off high-flying Preston.</p>
