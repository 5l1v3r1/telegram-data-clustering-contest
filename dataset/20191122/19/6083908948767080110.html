      <h1>Lindsey Graham Sends Official Request for Biden and Burisma-Related Documents</h1>

      <p>You may have forgotten, what with the Democrats' obsession over the supposed quid-pro-quo, bribery and extortion on the part of President Trump, but Joe and Hunter Biden have some shady ties to corrupt Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings. On the phone call that launched the inquiry against him, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens because Hunter sat on the board of Burisma and reportedly took in millions of dollars. Worse, the former vice president appears to have asked for the removal of Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin in a series of phone calls with former President Petro Poroshenko, who was investigating Burisma at the time. Democrats cried foul that Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Biden because he happens to be one of Trump's political rivals. But Trump insists it was all about rooting out corruption.</p>
      <p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is concerned about the same thing, so he's asked for a few relevant documents from the State Department.</p>

      <p>"Dear Secretary Pompeo," Sen. Graham <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/LG%20to%20MP%20re%20Biden%20and%20Ukraine.pdf">writes</a>, "to assist in answering questions regarding allegations that Vice President Biden played a role in the termination of Prosecutor General Shokin in an effort to end the investigation of the company employing his son, I request the following:</p>
      <p>"1. All documents and communications, including call transcripts or summaries, related to the Vice President's phone calls with President Poroshenko on February 11, 18, and 19 and March 22 of 2016, especially with respect to whether Vice President Biden mentioned the Prosecutor General's investigation into Burisma."</p>
      <p>"2. All documents and communications between the Vice President and his office and President Poroshenko and his office after the raid on Mr. Zlochevsky's home on February 2, 2016 until the dismissal of the Prosecutor General on March 29, 2016.</p>
      <p>"3. All documents and communications related to a meeting between Devon Archer, a business partner of Hunter Biden, and Secretary of State John Kerry on March 2, 2016."</p>
      <p>Mykola Zlochevsky, for reference, is the founder of Burisma Holdings.</p>
      <p>The Biden scandal came up once or twice during the public impeachment inquiry hearings, usually at the urging of Republicans. But when they did bring up the Bidens' shady connection to Burisma, the witnesses agreed that it was awfully fishy.</p>
      <p>"Clearly, it's an appearance of a conflict [of interest]," U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland admitted on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Yet, as lawmakers like Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) have noted, House Intel Chairman Adam Schiff won't allow the panel to question the Bidens.</p>
