      <h1>Pete Buttigieg’s Supporters &amp; Detractors Adopt Panic! At The Disco’s “High Hopes” As New Dance Anthem</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:47:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:47</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Mench</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/Panic-at-the-disco-high-hopes-lyrics">“High Hopes”</a> brought <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Panic-at-the-disco">Panic! at the Disco</a> back into the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the first time in a decade, and now it’s finding a second life thanks to South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>His supporters have adapted the song into a sort of spirit dance, with videos of their performances going viral on social media:</p>

      <p>The song’s average daily pageviews on Genius have nearly doubled in the past few days, rising from less than 600 on Nov. 15 to more than 900 on Nov. 21, driven by overall conversation around the song. But it’s not only Buttigieg’s supporters who are getting in on the trend. His detractors have also used it to mock his more centrist political positions, primarily through TikTok videos:</p>

      <p>Others have noted that the song’s first verse includes the phrase “Manifest Destiny”:</p>
      <blockquote>Mama said, fulfill the prophecy<br/>Be something greater, go make a legacy<br/>Manifest Destiny, back in the days<br/>We wanted everything, wanted everything</blockquote>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/westward-expansion/manifest-destiny">concept of Manifest Destiny</a> was the ideological underpinning behind the westward expansion of the United States, and was used as justification for the forced removal of Native Americans from their ancestral homelands and the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/mexican-american-war/mexican-american-war">Mexican-American War</a>.</p>
      <p>Although Buttigieg is polling well in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire (both of which skew heavily white), he’s had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/politics/pete-buttigieg-black-voters.html">well-publicized struggles</a> attracting meaningful support from the black community and other minority groups. <a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/22179/why-high-hopes-is-the-perfect-dance-song-for-the-pete-buttigieg-campaign">Some have argued</a> that the song’s lyrics feel tone deaf in light of these issues.</p>
      <p>Panic!’s primary member, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Brendon-urie">Brendon Urie</a>, has yet to comment on the use of his song by supporters of Buttigieg. Musicians have often objected to the use of their music in political campaigns, although primarily by Republicans and conservative politicians. It’s also unclear if the mayor’s campaign is officially promoting the dance or if it plans to license the song in any way. No matter what, the trend seems likely to continue boosting streams and pageviews for Panic!’s career-best hit in the coming weeks.</p>
