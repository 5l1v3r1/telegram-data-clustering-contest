      <p>WEST SIDE, Manhattan (WABC) -- The FDNY responded to a fire at Hudson Yards early Friday morning.</p>
      <p>A fire department spokesman says smoke on the fourth floor of the mall was reported shortly after 5:30 a.m. Friday.</p>
      <p>Tenth Avenue near 33rd Street was shut down to accommodate the firefighting activity.</p>
      <p>The fire was under control about an hour later, and no injuries were reported.</p>
      <p>The mall opened last March as part of the massive Hudson Yards development built over rail yards on Manhattan's west side.</p>
      <p>The shopping center features high-end stores and restaurants anchored by Neiman Marcus.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Hudson Yards developer Related Cos. says the mall will be open during its regularly scheduled hours Friday.</p>
      <p>The spokeswoman, Kathleen Anne Corless, says mall operators are working to ensure "a seamless experience" for employees and visitors.</p>
