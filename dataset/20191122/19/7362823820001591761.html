      <h1>Bloomberg launching ‘massive’ coast-to-coast ad buy</h1>

      <p>In the latest sign that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bloomberg-shelling-out-100-million-for-anti-trump-on-line-ads-in-key-battleground-states">Mike Bloomberg i</a>s moving toward a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election">run for the White House</a> and is willing to spend huge sums of money to try and topple President Trump, the billionaire business and media mogul is making a massive TV ad buy, which kicks off Monday.</p>
      <p>According to the television ad tracking firm Advertising Analytics, the former three-term New York City mayor is spending at least $12.2 million on an ad buy in TV markets across the country. The firm says it appears the commercials will run for a week.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Ben Taber, an account executive with the firm, tells Fox News it’s “a massive ad buy and it’s still growing.”</p>
      <p>Asked by Fox News, senior Bloomberg advisers would neither confirm nor deny reports of the ad buy.</p>
      <p>The move by the likely Democratic presidential candidate comes a week after he went up with a separate <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bloomberg-shelling-out-100-million-for-anti-trump-on-line-ads-in-key-battleground-states">$100 million digital ad buy</a> to run on-line ads that target Trump through the primaries in key general election battleground states.</p>
      <p>Advertising Analytics said one of the first ad buys spotted was in the West Palm Beach, Fla., TV media market, which is home to president’s winter White House, Mar-a-Lago. The president is expected to spend the Thanksgiving holiday next week at Mar-a-Lago.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg on Thursday filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run for president.</p>

      <p>But Bloomberg aides told Fox News the move was not an announcement that he’s running for president -- but merely another step in the process.</p>
      <p>A Bloomberg adviser told Fox News “when we filed a petition to get on the ballot in Alabama on November 8, it started a process where we had to file with the FEC within 15 days. This is another step towards running, but it's not an announcement nor indicative of a final decision.”</p>
      <p>Bloomberg has now filed to place his name on the presidential primary ballots in Alabama, Arkansas, Michigan, Georgia, and Texas.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg – the former Republican-turned-independent during his three consecutive terms as New York City mayor – changed his voter registration to Democrat last year. He flirted with a presidential bid early this year but ruled out a run in March.</p>
      <p>But his top advisers said earlier this month that Bloomberg changed his mind because he worried the current crop of 2020 Democratic White House contenders were not “well-positioned” to beat Trump next November.</p>
