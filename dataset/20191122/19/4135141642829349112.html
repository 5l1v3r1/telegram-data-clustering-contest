      <p>DeForest rolled the dice in head coach Mike Minick’s final game at the helm.</p>
      <p>It payed off.</p>
      <p>The Norskies went for two after scoring their first touchdown of the day in the final minute of the WIAA Division 3 championship game, converting and holding on for an 8-7 win over Menasha and their first title since 2007.</p>
      <p>Quarterback Trey Schroeder hit Gabe Finley on a 13-yard touchdown pass with 32 seconds remaining to get DeForest on the board, before floating a jump pass to Nolan Hawk for the two-point conversion.</p>
      <p>Schroeder completed three passes on the Norskies’ go-ahead drive, hitting Logan Bierman for 28 yards and Hawk for 11 yards before finding Finley for the score.</p>
      <p>For a while, it appeared that Menasha’s first-quarter touchdown would hold up as the game-winner.</p>
      <p>Davontre Smith punched in a nine-yard rushing touchdown on the game’s opening drive, a lead that lasted until the final minute of the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>The Bluejays’ defense made plays throughout, piling up seven tackles for loss, five sacks and two interceptions, while recovering a pair of fumbles.</p>
