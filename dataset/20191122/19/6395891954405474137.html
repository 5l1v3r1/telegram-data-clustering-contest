      <p>Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has sent a message to Pete Buttigieg (BOO'-tuh-juhj) with three endorsements from black Indiana leaders, including one from the South Bend mayor's hometown.</p>
      <p>The moves on Thursday underscore the mayor's trouble connecting with black voters even as he's surged to the top of polls in the first-caucus state of overwhelmingly white Iowa.</p>
      <p>Biden's new endorsers include South Bend Council officer Oliver Davis Jr. and two state representatives from metro Indianapolis.</p>
      <p>Davis said in a statement that the 77-year-old former vice president is "an experienced leader who has been through the diverse storms of life."</p>
      <p>Davis ran to succeed Buttigieg as mayor but finished fifth in a Democratic primary. Buttigieg's chief of staff, James Mueller, ultimately won the seat and will take office in January.</p>
