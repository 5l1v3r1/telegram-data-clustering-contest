      <p>It comes after years of speculation over his sexuality, with many fans believing he had a secret relationship with ex band mate Louis Tomlinson.</p>
      <p>And his tumultuous love life has also grabbed headlines, following high profile flings with the likes of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a> and Caroline Flack.</p>

      <p>"Honestly, I’d say I try and think about it as little as possible, because it’s a very strange, dynamic thing", he added.</p>
      <p>“It’s also like a weird thing to think of about yourself.</p>
      <p>“I guess the thing with like sex, in general, is like, it used to feel so much more taboo for me.</p>
      <p>“Even like when we were in the band, the thought of people thinking that I had sex was like, oh no, that’s crazy. What if they know?”</p>
      <p>He added that he finds it hard when his relationship break ups are reported in the press.</p>

      <p>"I think a lot of the time, when there’s tabloid stuff, for example, of people breaking up, I think people forget that there’s a person who’s also broken up with someone, which is sad", he said.</p>
      <p>"You get sad when you break up with someone.”</p>
      <p>Also during the interview, Harry admitted he" experimented" with illegal substances after quitting the band, saying that he bit the end of his tongue off in Malibu while high on mushrooms during the recording of his new album, Fine Line.</p>
      <p>Since leaving the band in 2016, Harry said that he then felt safe enough to experiment.</p>
      <p>He told Lowe: "When I was in the band, it was like, to me it felt like it was so much bigger than any of us that I kind of felt like, I'm not going to be the one who f***** it up.</p>

      <p>"So I was like, now is the time in my life when you probably go out and experiment and do this and you take this and you do that and that's what you do with your friends.</p>
      <p>"And I was like, I'm not going to be the guy who messes it up. So I was like, I'm not going to do any of that stuff."</p>
      <p>He also faced the wrath of former band mate Zayn Malik's fans after a cheeky joke he made while hosting Saturday Night Live.</p>

      <p>Mentioning the group which made him famous, Harry said he thought of the lads as his family, before teasing the audience about them being there on the show.</p>
      <p>s he reeled off their names Harry appeared to struggle over Zayn, who parted ways with the band before they officially announced their split.</p>
      <p>"I love those guys, they're my brothers. Niall, Liam, Louis... Uh.. Ringo! Yeah, that's it."</p>
      <p>Ringo Starr famously left The Beatles back in 1968, he quit the band for five months while they were recording their self-titled album, he later returned before they split for good in 1970.</p>
