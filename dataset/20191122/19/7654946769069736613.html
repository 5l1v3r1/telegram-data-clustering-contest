      <h1>Citi Bike say e-bikes are returning to NYC this winter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:05:22+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:05</time> by <a rel="author">Natalie Musumeci</a></address>
      <p>Bike lovers, rejoice!</p>
      <p>Citi Bike is bringing back its electric pedal-assist rides this winter <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/04/14/citi-bike-shuts-down-e-bike-fleet-over-brakes-issues/">after pulling them from service</a> across the Big Apple in April due to brake issues.</p>
      <p>Lyft, which owns Citi Bike, once hoped to have the e-bikes back this fall, but said the company is “taking extra time to make sure they’re safe and ready to go for New York City streets.”</p>
      <p>The pedal-assist bikes were yanked from service earlier this year after some riders “experienced stronger-than-expected braking force” on the front wheel, the company said.</p>
      <p>Battery problems then struck similar e-bikes in San Francisco, which forced the company to find a new battery supplier as it reworked the bike’s troublesome brake setup.</p>
      <p>“It’s taken longer than anticipated to get all the necessary components for the new bikes and complete safety testing, but we’re making progress,” Lyft said.</p>
      <p>Citi Bike plans to initially launch several hundred e-bikes this winter “and will gradually ramp up to a larger fleet.”</p>
      <p>The company is also ditching its previous plan to charge $2 fee for every e-bike ride, opting to charge 10 cents per minute for annual Citi Bike members and 15 cents per minute for non-members.</p>
      <p>“We’ve done the math, and the majority of riders will pay less for e-bike rides with per-minute pricing,” the company claimed. “When e-bikes were in service, 80 percent of member e-bike rides were under 20 minutes.”</p>
      <p>Citi Bike will also cap e-bike charges at $2 for member rides that begin and/or end outside of Manhattan and will remove the two-minute wait period between rides.</p>
      <p>Additionally, starting Jan. 15, Citi Bike will cut its extra time fees on its classic bikes.</p>
      <p>Members will now pay 15 cents per minute after the included 45 minutes, instead of $2.50 every 15 minutes. Riders with a single ride pass will also pay 15 cents per minute after the included 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>“These changes will eliminate a point of frustration and save riders money by only charging them for the time they use,” said the company.</p>
