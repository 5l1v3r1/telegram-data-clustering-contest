        <b>Mauricio Pochettino is supposedly ‘confident’ his Tottenham Hotspur replacement Jose Mourinho will not be a success.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mourinho took over from Pochettino in the space of just 11 hours , after Spurs chief Daniel Levy chose to part ways with the Argentinian.</p>
      <p>Tottenham had enjoyed a hugely successful time under Pochettino, establishing themselves as genuine Premier League title challengers and reaching last season’s Champions League final.</p>
      <p>However, it all seemed to go wrong this season, with the club languishing in 14th when Levy decided to wield the axe.</p>
      <p>In a shock move, former Chelsea and Manchester United boss Mourinho has been appointed as Spurs’ new head coach in a bid to turn their fortunes around.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese tactician ended his time at Old Trafford on a sour note, facing suggestions he had lost his mojo.</p>
      <p>It has now emerged that Pochettino seems to think along the same lines, with <i>ESPN</i> reporting that he is banking on Mourinho’s failure.</p>
      <p>According to their sources, Pochettino was not prepared to resign or leave via mutual consent.</p>
      <p>Instead, he was only willing to leave if another side approached him or he was sacked.</p>
      <p>Had he left the club any other way, Pochettino thinks it would have appeared as though he had failed and would have discouraged other elite sides from offering him a job.</p>
      <p>He supposedly believes Mourinho will fail in the role and has gambled on this belief coming true.</p>
      <p>If that becomes the case then no blame will fall at Pochettino’s door, with Levy getting the brunt of the criticism for giving up on the manager too soon.</p>
      <p>What is for sure now is that the former Southampton boss will be in the frame for every single top managerial job going.</p>
      <p>It has already been suggested that he could end up at Manchester United , while a move to Bayern Munich and a shock switch to Arsenal have also been mooted.</p>
