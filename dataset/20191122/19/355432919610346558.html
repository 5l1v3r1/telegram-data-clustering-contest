      <p>Billionaire <a href="https://thehill.com/people/michael-bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a> launched a multimillion-dollar ad buy across a number of states and markets Friday, as he prepares a potential presidential run.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/mike-bloomberg-launches-5-million-ad-blitz-as-he-prepares-2020-bid.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;par=sharebar">CNBC first reported</a> the news, citing data compiled from ad tracking firm Advertising Analytics.</p>
      <p>Advertising Analytics told The Hill that Bloomberg's ad buy had totaled $19.4 million over 90 local markets as of 2:40 p.m. ET. The firm also said that it expects the total number of markets to increase to 100 by the end of the day.</p>
      <p>The minute-long ads will start airing Monday and run through Dec. 2.</p>
      <p>The most expensive ad buys were in New York City, with $1.6 million, and Los Angeles, with $1.4 million. Other markets targeted include those in Florida, Texas, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg is considering jumping into the race for the Democratic nomination and has filed paperwork to run in a handful of states. On Thursday, the 77-year-old filed federal paperwork to run for president, but Bloomberg's camp has said that the move was only "procedural" and that it wasn't an official announcement of his candidacy </p>
