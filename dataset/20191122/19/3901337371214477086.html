      <p>“I am very fit and oozing with confidence right now. We are playing against Mikhado tomorrow (Saturday) in Venda and I am looking forward to it. The support I have been getting from everyone here since I arrived at the club is amazing and encouraging. I’m getting the support from the chairman, technical team, players and everyone associated with the club, and that’s pushing me to do well. The confidence is back and my aim is to move a step up in January to either an NFD (GladAfrica Championship) club or straight to the PSL (Absa Premiership). The confidence and fitness is what I want to tell you about, and as for the skill, you and everyone know,” Khanye boasts. </p>
