      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:24:43+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:24</time> by <a rel="author">FOX Sports Indiana</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/indiana-pacers-team">Pacers</a>, who have been beset by injuries all season, are hoping to get two players back Saturday.</p>
      <p>The team announced Friday on Twitter that guard/forward <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/jeremy-lamb-player-stats">Jeremy Lamb</a> and guard <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/tj-mcconnell-player-stats">T.J. McConnell</a> are probable for Saturday’s game against the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/orlando-magic-team">Magic</a>.</p>
      <p>Guard <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/malcolm-brogdon-player-stats">Malcolm Brogdon</a> (sore back) was listed as doubtful, while guard <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/edmond-sumner-player-stats">Edmond Sumner</a> (right hand), forward <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/jakarr-sampson-player-stats">JaKarr Sampson</a> (sore back) and, of course, All-Star guard <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/victor-oladipo-player-stats">Victor Oladipo</a> (knee) are out.</p>
      <p>Lamb has missed the Pacers’ last seven games with a left ankle injury. He has played in only five games this season, but when active he has produced, averaging 17.0 points per game.</p>
      <p>McConnell, whose playing time increased as other players went down, sat out Indiana’s last two games with a sore right groin. Prior to the injury he had scored in double digits in three of his last four games while averaging 6.8 assists.</p>
      <p>The Pacers (8-6) open a four-game homestand Saturday night.</p>
