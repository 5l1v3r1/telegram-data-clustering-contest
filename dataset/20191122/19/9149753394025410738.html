      <h1>This refurbished HP gaming PC with a GTX 1060 6GB is just $600 right now</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday</a> is still a week away, but if you're hoping to snag a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-pc/">gaming PC</a> on sale, you might not have to wait. HP is selling <a href="https://computers.woot.com/plus/gaming-laptops-desktops-23?ref=w_cnt_odet_w_crum_2_wp">a bunch of refurbished HP desktops and laptops</a> right now, and the best bang-for-your-buck appears to be an Omen PC with a GTX 1060 6GB for $599.99 from Amazon-owned Woot.</p>
      <p>The full specifications include an AMD Ryzen 5 2600 processor, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB graphics card, 8GB of 2666MHz RAM, a 256GB NVMe SSD, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth 4.2. WIndows 10 Home is pre-installed, and a keyboard and mouse are included.</p>
      <p>Most <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=100897449&amp;LeftPriceRange=500%20650">new gaming desktops around this price</a> have either an RX 580 3GB or 1060 3GB graphics cardâ€”both of which are slower than the mid-range 1060 6GB in this model. The GTX 1060 is getting a bit old at this point, but it can still handle pretty much every game you throw at it, though more demanding titles like Red Dead Redemption 2 might require turning down some settings. You can get an idea for its performance from <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/geforce-gtx-1060-review/">our original review</a>.</p>
      <p>We usually don't recommend refurbished products here at PC Gamer, since most of them are sold by third-parties with less-than-ideal quality control. However, this PC has been refurbished by HP itself, and the company is selling it with a 90-day warranty.</p>
