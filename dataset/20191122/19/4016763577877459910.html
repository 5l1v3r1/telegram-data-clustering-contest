      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/stormzy">Stormzy</a>’s rollout for his upcoming album, <i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Stormzy/Heavy-is-the-head">Heavy Is the Head</a></i>, is underway, and he just linked up with <a href="https://genius.com/artists/ed-sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/burna-boy">Burna Boy</a> on <a href="https://genius.com/Stormzy-own-it-lyrics">“Own It.”</a></p>
      <p>This pre-release single finds the unlikely trio flirting with their love interest, as Stormzy spits:</p>
      <blockquote>Pulled up in the party, when you saw me, I was lightin' up my J'<br/>So go ahead and brighten up my day<br/>Lighters in the air when you lighting up the rave<br/>And it’s feelin' like I met you here before (‘Fore)<br/>Girl, I felt your presence when they let you through the door</blockquote>
      <p>Sheeran’s verse is dedicated to chilling with his girl:</p>
      <blockquote>You love the sick vibe, I wanted more than one<br/>Up to nothing, nobody knew where I was comin' from<br/>But we got the same mind, so I don’t wanna waste time<br/>Bring it to me, come by, that’s what I need<br/>That’s right, kissin' your cheek, one time</blockquote>
      <p>This isn’t the first time Stormzy and Sheeran joined forces on a track. Earlier this year, they teamed up on <a href="https://genius.com/Ed-sheeran-take-me-back-to-london-lyrics">“Take Me Back To London.”</a> Back in 2017, the British rapper hopped on a <a href="https://genius.com/Ed-sheeran-shape-of-you-stormzy-remix-lyrics">remix of “Shape of You.”</a></p>
