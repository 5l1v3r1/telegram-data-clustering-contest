      <h1>Probe into Austrian far-right party finds gold hidden in Alpine hotel</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:20:23+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:20</time> by <a rel="author">Alastair Jamieson </a></address>
      <p>Investigators probing Austria’s far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) found a stash of gold bars hidden at a guesthouse in the Tyrolean Alps.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors and police raided the picturesque <a href="http://pensionenzian.at/galerie/">Pension Enzian</a> in St. Jakob, near the Italian border, as part of an inquiry into disgraced former leader Heinz-Christian Strache, who was the country’s Vice-Chancellor in an ill-fated coalition that collapsed in May.</p>
      <p>FPÖ says it bought the gold as an investment in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, but Austria’s second-largest party, SPO, is demanding answers.</p>
      <p>“The possible suspicion of money-laundering must be fully investigated,” SPO leader Pamela Rendi-Wagner told Euronews. “We will use the necessary parliamentary instruments.”</p>
      <p>The current FPÖ leadership needs to provide an explanation, she said.</p>

      <p>However, the far-right party is <a href="https://www.fpoe-wien.at/news-detail/artikel/empoerung-rund-um-ruecklagen-der-fpoe-wien-ist-sturm-im-wasserglas/">dismissing the discovery as “a storm in a glass of water”</a> and claims that investing in gold is “a sensible and economically comprehensible” investment during the banking crisis.</p>
      <p>“I guess it would have been better to invest in a savings account with a collapsing bank, in falling shares or Greek bonds,” FPÖ secretary-general Christian Hafenecker joked on Twitter. "Journalists, are you really so bored?"</p>
      <p>The FPÖ formed a 2017 coalition with the centre-right OVP, led by Sebastien Kurz. At the time, it was the only government in western Europe to include a far-right party.</p>
      <p>However, Strache quit in May after a video emerged of him in Ibiza with a woman posing as a Russian oligarch’s niece, apparently offering to fix state contracts and explaining how to dodge party financing laws.</p>
      <p>After the collapse of the coalition, a September election saw Kurz return as Chancellor while support for the FPÖ slumped.</p>
      <p>Weekly magazine <a href="https://www.profil.at/oesterreich/goldschatz-fpoe-11225876">Profil, which first reported the gold discovery</a>, said Pension Enzian is the registered address of an organisation called the "Freedom Education Institute" which was bought in 2012 by a consortium linked to FPÖ lawmakers in Vienna. The 3-star hotel <a href="http://pensionenzian.at/galerie/">promises on its website</a> that guests “will be enchanted.”</p>
