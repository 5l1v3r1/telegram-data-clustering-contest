      <h1>Man filmed spewing anti-Semitic abuse at dad and little boy on London Tube train</h1>
      <h2>Footage shows the man reading from the bible while harassing a Jewish father and son before bystanders intervene only to get a mouthful of abuse and threats of violence</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:54:17+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:54</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>An horrific video shows a man spewing "anti-Semitic abuse" at a Jewish father and his little boy and reading from what appears to be a Bible on the London Underground.</p>
      <p>The video, posted on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>, shows a man standing next to the father and young son and reading from a book.</p>
      <p>He leans into the dad and son, who are sat down and wearing Jewish skull caps, making it clear he is reading to them.</p>
      <p>He reacts angrily and aggressively towards other passengers who intervene to try to stop him, threatening to assault one and swearing repeatedly.</p>
      <p>And when a woman in a head scarf steps in to defend the father and his young son, he tells her she should not be wearing trousers and spends the remainder of the footage arguing with her and repeating anti-Semitic ideas.</p>

      <p>British Transport Police (BTP) said they were "aware of a video circulating on Twitter which shows passengers being harassed and being targeted with anti-Semitic abuse on a Northern Line train".</p>
      <p>The man, who is black, reads a passage from Revelation 3:9 - in the final book of the New Testament - which contains references to the "synagogue of Satan" and people who "claim to be Jews but are not".</p>
      <p>He then spews various anti-Semitic slurs which Mirror Online has chosen not to repeat.</p>

      <p>Throughout the video the father and son remain seated and calm, refusing to respond to the abuse. The father speaks to his bewildered boy and appears to be reassuring him.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for BTP said: "We are aware of a video circulating on Twitter which shows passengers being harassed and being targeted with anti-Semitic abuse on a Northern Line train.</p>
      <p>"Enquiries are being made in relation to this footage.</p>
      <p>"Anyone who witnessed what happened, or who has any information, is asked to contact BTP by sending a text to 61016 or by calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 357 of 22/11.”</p>

      <p>Metropolitan Police said: "BTP are dealing with this incident as it happened on the tube."</p>
      <p>Chris Atkins, who posted the clip, said: "Around noon I witnessed appalling anti Semitic abuse towards this Jewish Family on the northern line.</p>
      <p>"Fair play to other passengers who stood up to him. If you recognise the guy please report to Met Police."</p>
      <p>Responses to the video from outraged Twitter users include: "How dare he wave his fingers in that child’s face."</p>

      <p>Another wrote: "My heart goes out to that Dad. Trying to keep it normal for his family. What a disgusting thing to do."</p>
      <p>And the actions of the woman in the headscarf came in for praise, with one writing: "Disgraceful behaviour by that ghastly man.</p>
      <p>"On the positive side fellow passengers stood up to him, especially a kindly Muslim lady."</p>
      <p>"This is disgraceful. Why is he harassing a child!" wrote another.</p>

      <p>"Thank you to that man off camera and that lady for intervening. She was right to ask him politely not to use that language in front of young children," they added.</p>
      <p>One Twitter user even said they "take a real positive from this."</p>
      <p>They wrote: "That guy - what an ar******, but the lady who challenged him... I’d give her a medal. The country is okay when there’s still people like her in it."</p>
      <p>Another expressed sympathy for the small child, writing: "That poor guy - a father - sitting there with his arm around his son, trying to calmly explain to him why a random stranger is hurling a load of anti Semitic abuse at them.</p>
      <p>"Appalling and deeply upsetting. I hope they find this guy."</p>
