      <p>With Apple TV Plus and <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyplus.bn5x.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F705874%2F9358%3FsubId1%3DUUwpUdUnU72094YYw%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.disneyplus.com%252F&amp;token=jWk1Lqqc">Disney Plus</a> finally launching in living rooms and across all of our mobile phones, tablets, computers, and anywhere else you can watch, you might be wondering how to earn the most rewards now that you are adding yet another subscription to your ever-growing list.</p>
      <p>While Apple will no doubt recommend Apple Card's 3% Daily Cash for Apple TV+ and other card companies market their partnerships or rewards with Disney+, there is one card out there that earns consistently higher than almost anyone. Even better, it not only earns more for Apple TV+ and Disney+ but for almost every streaming subscription you have. That card is the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express, which earns cardholders an unbeatable 6% cash back on streaming subscriptions.</p>
      <h3>The Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express</h3>

Streaming services join transit and grocery shopping at 6% cash back which is practically triple what most other cards offer in these categories. Pair that with its other rewards and perks and this card is a no brainer for anyone looking to earn the most on their most common purchases. So, if you are a new subscriber to Apple TV+, Disney+, or any of the other twenty-four streaming services that are currently covered, start rewarding yourself with every watch.</p>
