      <p>A heavyweight showdown between submission specialist <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2636/alexey-oleinik">Aleksei Oleinik</a> and former Ultimate Fighter contender <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4688/maurice-greene">Maurice Greene</a> is currently in the works for the first UFC pay-per-view of 2020.</p>
      <p>Multiple sources confirmed to MMA Fighting that verbal agreements are in place for the fight expected to take place at <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1086/ufc-246">UFC 246</a> on Jan. 18 in Las Vegas. News of the fight was first reported by <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/aleksei-oleinik-vs-maurice-greene-ufc-246-january-las-vegas">MMAJunkie</a>.</p>
      <p>Oleinik will look to right the ship when he returns in January after suffering back-to-back knockout losses to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/32/alistair-overeem">Alistair Overeem</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1436/walter-walt-harris">Walt Harris</a>. Prior to those setbacks, the Russian grappler haad picked up impressive wins over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/139/mark-hunt">Mark Hunt</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4090/junior-albini">Junior Albini</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Greene will also try to bounce back from his first loss in the UFC when he fell to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/5155/sergei-pavlovich">Sergei Pavlovich</a> by first round TKO in October.</p>
      <p>Greene is currently 3-1 overall in the UFC including wins over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4689/michel-batista">Michel Batista</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4762/jeff-hughes">Jeff Hughes</a>.</p>
      <p>Oleinik vs. Greene is the latest addition to the UFC 246 card that is expected to be headlined by former two-division champion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1859/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> in his first return to action since 2018.</p>
