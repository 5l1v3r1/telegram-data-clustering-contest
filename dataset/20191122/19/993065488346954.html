      <p>Strictly Come Dancing’s Saffron Barker has quipped that training for the famously tough samba had her “nearly screaming with agony”.</p>
      <p>The social media star, 19, survived a dance-off against RuPaul’s Drag Race judge Michelle Visage, 51, at Blackpool’s famous Tower Ballroom last week.</p>
      <p>Barker is hoping to improve her fortunes this week with a samba to Walking On Sunshine by Take Me To Rio Collective.</p>

      <p>Appearing on Strictly spin-off It Takes Two, Barker said the “bouncing” involved in the samba style had been tough on her calf muscles.</p>
      <p>She said: “Oh the feet and the calves. The calves are the worst they have been.</p>
      <p>“One day this week we did have to finish early because I was trying to do it and I was literally nearly screaming with agony.</p>
      <p>“And they said: ‘You literally need to go to bed.’”</p>
      <p>Pritchard added: “I just want to clarify that finishing early is still nine hours straight.”</p>
      <p>“At least,” Barker added.</p>

      <p>Six couples remain in the competition with Kelvin Fletcher and Karim Zeroual tipped as frontrunners.</p>
      <p>Barker described the situation as “scary,” adding: “It’s really serious now.”</p>
      <p>Pritchard agreed, saying: “The competition is definitely heating up but we are just going to go out there and have fun, and everyone will enjoy our routine.”</p>
      <p>The episode also saw the cast of the show wish It Takes Two co-host Zoe Ball a happy 49th birthday, with Amy Dowden congratulating her in Welsh and Janette Manrara doing the same in Spanish.</p>
      <p>Strictly Come Dancing continues on BBC One.</p>
