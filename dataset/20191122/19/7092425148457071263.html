      <p>A source told <i>The Sun Online</i>: "Katie says she’s not watching the show, but when Emily Atack mentioned her on Extra Camp all her friends told her what she said.</p>
      <p>"Loads of fans were messaging her on social media too – and Katie was furious.</p>
      <p>"She was telling people that she can’t believe Emily would say something so snide and if she ‘wants a problem, I’ll give her a problem’."</p>
      <p>Price even considered flying over to confront Atack, and asked her pals for the former Inbetweeners star's number.</p>
      <p>The source added: “At one point Katie was saying she’d fly out to Australia and confront her.</p>
      <p>"She’s not going to, obviously, but she was asking around to see if anyone had Emily’s number.</p>
      <p>"She thinks she wouldn’t be so brave to say it to her face.</p>
      <p>“Katie reckons she’s due a public apology from Emily. She’s never had any issue with Emily so she’s really shocked by her joke.”</p>
