      <p><b>LOS ANGELES (AP) — </b>A 13-year-old boy was arrested and a rifle was seized after the teen threatened to shoot other students and staff at his Los Angeles-area middle school, authorities said Friday.</p>
      <p>Deputies serving a search warrant at the boy’s home Thursday discovered an AR-15-style gun, 100 rounds of ammunition, a list of names and a drawing of the school, said Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva.</p>
      <p>The boy said he would carry out the shooting Friday at Animo Mae Jemison Charter Middle School in Willowbrook, Villanueva said at a news conference.</p>
      <p>The boy was arrested without incident at his home on suspicion of making criminal threats, the sheriff said.</p>
      <p>Investigators were trying to determine where he got the gun. In an earlier tweet, Undersheriff Tim Murakami made reference to a “ghost gun” being seized but Villanueva clarified the weapon in the threat case has a serial number.</p>
      <p>Multiple students overheard the alleged threats and alerted teachers. School officials immediately notified the sheriff’s department.</p>
      <p>Villanueva also disclosed another arrest of a juvenile had taken place in a separate case in Palmdale, north of Los Angeles. He said a high school student was taken into custody after making threats on social media after a campus fight that led to school suspensions. The sheriff said he did not believe a weapon was recovered.</p>
      <p>Last week a 16-year-old boy used a ghost gun to fatally shoot two classmates and himself at Saugus High School in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita.</p>
      <p>Villanueva said Thursday that Nathaniel Berhow’s .45 caliber, 1911-model replica semi-automatic pistol was assembled from gun parts and did not have a serial number.</p>
      <p>Police don’t yet know where and when Berhow got the handgun or what his motive was for the shooting at Saugus High.</p>
