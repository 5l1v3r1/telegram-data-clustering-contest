      <p>Sid Meier’s Civilization VI Expansion Bundle is available now on the Nintendo Switch and to celebrate the launch of the downloadable content, Nintendo of America has put together a launch trailer giving a glimpse of what players can expect from the bundled Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions. You can view that below.</p>
      <blockquote>Sid Meier’s Civilization VI Expansion Bundle, which combines both Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions, takes the turn-based strategy classic to new heights, and is now available for Nintendo Switch! With sixteen new civilizations, eighteen new leaders, and major enhancements to gameplay such as Great Ages and an active planet where geology and climatology present unique new challenges, the pursuit of building the greatest empire becomes as exciting as it has ever been in the Civilization franchise.</blockquote>
