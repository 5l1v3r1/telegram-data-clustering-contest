      <p>Col. Hameed Ali (rtd), the Comptroller-General of Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) says he will sack any officer who cannot live within his or her remuneration and involve in illicit ways to acquire wealth.</p>
      <p>Ali gave the warning while decorating some newly promoted officers of the service in Abuja on Friday.</p>
      <p>News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the service recently promoted 2,508 officers to various ranks and appointed three as members of its management.</p>
      <p>The customs boss warned that no officer in the service should live above his or her earnings if they desire to remain in service.</p>
      <p>According to him, every officer could survive within the remuneration package of the service, if well managed.</p>
      <p>“I will show the way out to any officer who thinks he can not survive with his remuneration but involve in illicit ways to acquire wealth.</p>
      <p>“I know the service gives you enough that you can survive with, it is just a question of prudence.</p>
      <p>“You can never have everything you that you desire to acquire</p>
      <p>“You must prioritise your needs and by the time you do that, you will meet your needs,” he advised.</p>
      <p>Ali charged the newly promoted officers to be more committed and dedicated to their duties.</p>
      <p>He advised them to take their jobs seriously, be fair and firm in ther decisions and actions.</p>
      <p>Ali enjoined the promoted officers to uphold the change mantra in the service and be part of the reform being carried out.</p>
      <p>Mr David Chikan, Deputy Comptroller-General who spoke on behalf of the promoted officers thanked the management for their elevations.</p>
      <p>Chikan assured that they would justify the confidence reposed in them.</p>
