      <p>Jeremy Corbyn says he will adopt a ‘neutral stance’ in a second Brexit referendum.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader was the first to be grilled by voters during a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/jeremy-corbyn-reveals-hell-remain-neutral-second-brexit-referendum-11204179/">special episode of BBC’s Question Time</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn was quizzed over fears for businesses, anti-Semitism, misogyny, freedom of speech and his support of ousted Bolivia president Evo.</p>
      <p>When asked how he would campaign if he wins next month’s election, he said he would start by negotiating a ‘credible’ Leave deal before he was interrupted by groans from sections of the audience.</p>

      <p>However, making his clearest comments to date on the issue, he continued: ‘My role and the role of our government will be to ensure that that referendum is held in a fair atmosphere and we will abide by the result of it.</p>
      <p>‘And I will adopt, as prime minister, if I am at the time, a neutral stance so that I can credibly carry out the results of that to bring communities and country together rather than continuing an endless debate about the EU and Brexit.’</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn began his slot on the defensive, asked whether businesses ‘should be frightened of an incoming Labour government’.</p>
      <p>But he argued only the ‘biggest businesses will be asked to pay a little more’ in corporation tax, but added the level will be lower than that in 2010.</p>
      <p>He also fended off an angry audience member who declared ‘freedom would be completely eroded’ if he got the keys to Number 10.</p>
      <p>‘I have spent my life getting into hot water for defending people because I believed their human rights should not be violated and that’s the kind of government that I intend to lead,’ Mr Corbyn said.</p>

      <p>Another confronted him about sexism and anti-Semitism faced by his MPs – in particular Ruth Smeeth, who is Jewish – saying he does not ‘buy this nice old grandpa’ image.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Nobody should suffer any abuse in public life or privately,’ he replied.</p>
      <p>‘Many women Labour MPs, Ruth Smeeth included and others, have suffered the most unbelievable levels of abuse.’</p>
      <p>He then reminded the audience ‘it was a Labour MP, Jo Cox, who was murdered because she stood up in public life’.</p>
      <p>‘I simply say to you that bad behaviour, misogynism, racism in any form is absolutely not acceptable in any form whatsoever in my party or in society,’ Mr Corbyn added.</p>
