      <p>“People close to Justin and Chrishell are completely shocked by Justin filing for divorce,” a source told <a href="https://www.etonline.com/justin-hartley-files-for-divorce-from-wife-chrishell-stause-after-2-years-of-marriage-136929"><i>ET</i></a>. “The couple has always been incredible with no signs of things being on the rocks.”</p>
      <p>“Friends are speculating this was an impulse on Justin’s side due to something that happened,” the source continued. “And are hopeful the couple can work things out.”.</p>
