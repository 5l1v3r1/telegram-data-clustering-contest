      <p><b>MOSCOW (AP)</b> - The governing body for track and field will consider expelling Russia from membership following new charges that senior officials faked medical records.</p>
      <p>Russia has been suspended by World Athletics, formerly known as the IAAF, over widespread doping since 2015. There will be a review of whether vetted Russians should still be allowed to compete in international events as neutrals.</p>
      <p>"We need to deal with renegade factions like this," World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said Friday in Monaco.</p>
      <p>World Athletics has frozen talks about lifting the long-running suspension and asked its Russia task force for recommendations on expelling the country's track federation.</p>
      <p>"It's not symbolic," said Coe, who said the charges and suspensions against Russian officials were so wide-ranging that they left the task force with almost no one left to talk to.</p>
      <p>One route could be to close the Russian track federation and set up a new national governing body. Russia's sports minister said he had referred the federation to a commission which oversees such matters.</p>
      <p>Federation president Dmitry Shlyakhtin and four other senior officials are accused of obstructing the investigation into 2017 world championship silver medalist Danil Lysenko, who was accused last year of failing to make himself available for drug testing.</p>
      <p>Lysenko allegedly provided fake medical documents as an alibi with help from the officials. He and his coach have also been suspended by the Athletics Integrity Unit pending full disciplinary hearings.</p>
      <p>Also Friday, the three-time world high jump champion Mariya Lasitskene assailed Russian track leaders after they were charged Thursday, saying they have made a "doping nightmare" even worse.</p>
      <p>Lasitskene called for swift and radical reforms, and the removal of officials appointed by Shlyakhtin.</p>
      <p>Shlyakhtin took office shortly after the federation was suspended from international competition for widespread doping. The suspension remains in place four years later.</p>
      <p>"The new team, whose task was to take us out of this doping nightmare, has turned out no better than the old one. And in some ways worse," Lasitskene wrote on Instagram.</p>
      <p>"Shlyakhtin and his team must quit their posts immediately and never come back. And I will make sure this happens."</p>
      <p>Lasitskene has won two of her three world titles as a neutral athlete as a result of Russia's suspension, which also caused her to miss the 2016 Olympics.</p>
      <p>"Our track and field is in its death throes and we can't procrastinate anymore," she wrote. "We've lost four years already. Clean athletes are still defenseless and not sure they'll be able to compete tomorrow."</p>
      <p>Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov expressed concern about the "emergency situation" and referred the federation to a ministry commission which could officially withdraw its government recognition.</p>
      <p>"The future fate of the track and field federation will be examined," Kolobkov said Friday in a video statement. "For us now, the main thing is that the training process isn't interrupted. That means all of the athletes will get the help they need to continue the training and competition process."</p>
      <p>Earlier, the Kremlin said the charges against Shlyakhtin and others won't derail the country's preparations to compete in next year's Olympics.</p>
      <p>"Undoubtedly, this (situation) requires attention from the sports authorities, and I'm sure they're dealing with it," said Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin. "But I don't see a direct connection with Russia's participation in the Olympics here."</p>
      <p>With Shlyakhtin suspended, the federation is set to select an interim president at a board meeting on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Russia is also facing a World Anti-Doping Agency ruling next month on whether it manipulated data from a lab in Moscow.</p>
