      <p>‘Like everyone at this time of year you go, “Oh no! Again. I thought I paid that”.</p>
      <p>‘I had a meeting about this earlier on in the year and I thought about it long and hard and said no and then as it crept along to September and I got an estimate for my tax I phoned them up and said “is it too late to say yes?” So here I am.</p>
      <p>‘I give myself a bit of a talking to, and then I spoke to the accountant and he made my mind up.’</p>
