      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/emily-atack/">Emily Atack</a> had a heart to heart with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adam-thomas/">Adam Thomas</a> as the two took some time away from their presenting duties for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>: Extra Camp.</p>
      <p>And the 29-year-old didn’t seem to have a care in the world as the duo took a break from the jungle – and it seems like her feud with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/katie-price/">Katie Price</a> was the last thing on her mind as she enjoyed some down time.</p>
      <p>Emily donned a jungle-appropriate camouflage dress, complete with sunglasses, while Adam opted for a cool but casual grey sleeveless t-shirt.</p>
      <p>As she sipped on her drink, she and Adam appeared to be very busy in conversation.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/im-a-celebrity-extra-camp-2019-swaps-scarlett-moffat-and-joe-swash-for-emily-atack-and-adam-thomas-10890255/">two are new presenters</a> for the spin-off series to I’m A Celebrity, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/20/scarlett-moffatt-joins-joe-swash-in-quitting-im-a-celeb-extra-camp-after-three-years-10432048/">both replacing Scarlett Moffatt and Joe Swash respectively</a>, after they previously quit their roles earlier in the year.</p>

      <p>Earlier in the week, Emily <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-celebs-emily-atack-makes-dig-katie-price-peter-andres-former-relationship-11182002/">threw some shade towards former I’m A Celeb contestants Katie Price and Peter Andre</a>, who famously fell in love with each other when they competed on the show together in 2004.</p>
      <p>During Tuesday night’s edition of Extra Camp, while watching Adam and fellow co-host Joel Dommett take a dip in the jungle’s iconic lake, they were all reminded of when Katie and Peter famously smooched in the water.</p>
      <p>‘This is where Katie Price and Peter Andre had fondles,’ Joel boasted.</p>

      <p>‘I hope you boys went to the clinic after being in that pool,’ Emily replied.</p>
      <p>And Katie has not been left very impressed by what the former Inbetweeners star had to say.</p>

      <p>‘Katie says she’s not watching the show, but when Emily Atack mentioned her on Extra Camp all her friends told her what she said,’ a source shared to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10378563/katie-price-threatens-australia-extra-camp-stds/">The Sun.</a></p>
      <p>‘She was telling people that she can’t believe Emily would say something so snide and if she “wants a problem, I’ll give her a problem.”’</p>

      <p>The former glamour model has since made a personal attack on Emily in a video shared to her Instagram story, as she claimed she was heading to the jungle to confront her in person.</p>

      <p>‘So Emily Atack you think it’s clever do you to slag me of? Who are you anyway?’ she said. ‘Looks like I’m coming for you.</p>
      <p>‘Because if you’ve got something to say don’t say it behind my back on telly, say it to me.’</p>
