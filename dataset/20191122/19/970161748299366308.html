      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/paul-mccartney/">Paul McCartney</a> made sure he got Brian May’s blessing before accepting his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/glastonbury/">Glastonbury</a> gig.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the infamous guitarist revealed Queen would not play the festival after his dispute with Michael Eavis over badger culling.</p>
      <p>But while the 72-year-old is putting his foot down, the former Beatles star is getting ready to take to the stage next summer.</p>
      <p>And it turns out he phoned up his pal before confirming the date.</p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram, Brian spoke about the singer, as he shared a newspaper clipping with the headline: ‘Sir Paul to headline 50th Glastonbury.’</p>

      <p>He wrote: ‘Paul to play Glastonbury ! Yes – some people have been commenting to me about this, relative to my recent comments about my unwillingness to play this festival.</p>

      <p>‘Well, to set the record straight, Paul was kind enough to phone me about this before he accepted the invitation.’</p>
      <p>The star added: ‘He was concerned that he might be thought to be endorsing the current mass killing of badgers. Paul, a great campaigner on behalf of animals, is firmly against the badger cull.</p>
      <p>‘I told him he should not feel any obligations – that my reluctance to play was based on the personal comments Michael Eavis has made about me. It’s true.’</p>

      <p>He continued: ‘I work daily with people who disagree with me in matters like this – it’s necessary in order to move forward.</p>
      <p>‘But I don’t have to work with people who insult me who are ignorant of the work I do. And … in the end the book is never closed … people can change, and I’m always open to that.’</p>
      <p>Wrapping up his post, the musician said: ‘In the meantime I wish Paul and his band a great gig. Bri.’</p>
      <p>Emily Eavis announced the news that Paul would be taking to the Pyramid Stage for the 50th anniversary celebrations at Worthy Farm.</p>
      <p>‘IT’S REAL!! So excited.. Having Paul McCartney coming back to headline the Pyramid next year is an absolute dream come true,’ she wrote on Instagram.</p>
