        <b>Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said he feels no extra pressure with highly rated Mauricio Pochettino on the market following the Argentine's shock exit from Tottenham.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Old Trafford hierarchy have been long-term admirers of Pochettino, who followed a promising stint at Southampton with an impressive reign in north London that peaked with June’s Champions League final.<br/><br/>Pochettino was sacked this week following a disappointing start to the season, with Solskjaer’s predecessor Jose Mourinho swiftly appointed by the north Londoners.<br/><br/>The United boss welcomed Mourinho’s return to the English Premier League and said he was unruffled by Pochettino’s availability.<br/><br/>“Sorry to disappoint, but it’s not going to be about Jose or Mauricio,” Solskjaer said at the start of his press conference on Friday (Nov 22).<br/><br/>“I can start with it’s good to have Jose back definitely – especially for you guys, maybe for me because you can talk and write about everything else.”</p>
      <p>The Norwegian added: “And for Mauricio, it’s always sad when one of your colleagues, a good man, you lose your job before Christmas. It’s never nice to see, so I just wish him all the best.<br/><br/>“In football, you can never be surprised at anything, or you can’t be shocked at anything. For me, I’ve just got to focus on us.”</p>
      <p>Asked if United's link to Pochettino brings pressure, Solskjaer added: “No, it doesn’t bother me at all. I’ve got the best job in the world and I am sure if you’re in a job or if you’re out of a job and you’re a manager, you’d want this job.<br/><br/>“So, it doesn’t really matter, whatever happens around it. I’ve got to focus on my job at Man United, do it as well as we can.”</p>
      <p>Solskjaer takes his side to Sheffield United on Monday morning (Singapore time), following the international break.<br/><br/>The United boss said Paul Pogba was stepping up his recovery and his injured ankle was out of a cast but the French World Cup winner would still be out “for a few weeks”. – <i>AFP</i></p>
