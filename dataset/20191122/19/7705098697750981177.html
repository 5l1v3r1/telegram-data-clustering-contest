      <p>For the second year in a row, <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/doctor-who"><b>Doctor Who</b></a> will not have a Christmas special, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/no-doctor-who-special-christmas-20917725">according to The Mirror</a>. Instead, the 12th season of the hit series will ring in 2020 with a two-part special, kicking off on New Year’s Day.  The second part of the premiere will air three days later, on January 4. The rest of the 10-episode season will play out in weekly episodes later in 2020.</p>
      <p>A source within BBC explained this could be one of the biggest events yet for the series. “It’s going to be huge. The scale is just epic. No one will be disappointed.”</p>
      <p>The story behind the premiere is tightly under wraps. However, according to the Mirror, this season will mark the return of several fan favorite villains, including the Cybermen.</p>

      <p>Jodie Whitaker will once again return to the role of  the Doctor. Also joining her is Bradley Walsh as Graham O’Brien, Tosin Cole as Ryan Sinclair, and Mandip Gill as Yashim Khan.</p>
      <p>Last season was a big hit for the Doctor and her friends. Approximately 8.6 million viewers tuned in for the Doctor’s adventures, the show’s biggest numbers in over a decade.</p>
      <p>The Mirror’s report also hints that a special holiday-themed episode with the Daleks may have already been filmed. But it likely won’t air until Christmas 2020.</p>
