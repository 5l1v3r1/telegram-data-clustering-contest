      <h1>GQ had to issue a hilarious correction when it screwed up how Alexander Vindman got his Purple Heart</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:03:30+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/ellen-ioanes" target="_blank">Ellen Ioanes</a></address>

        <li>A GQ story from Oct. 29 said that Lt. Col. Alexander VIndman, a key witness in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, originally ran with a line saying that Vindman was awarded the Purple Heart after being injured by an IUD. </li>
        <li>Nearly a month later, a screenshot of the correction began circulating on Twitter, noting that Vindman was injured by an IED — an improvised explosive device — and not an IUD, a method of birth control.</li>
        <li>Vindman left Ukraine for the United States when he was 3, and now serves in the National Security Council as an expert on Ukraine.</li>
        <li>He has testified in the impeachment inquiry about overhearing a July 25 phone call between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump asked Zelensky to invesitgate Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for president. </li>

      <p>An Oct. 29 <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/vindman-gop-attacking-vets">GQ story</a> about Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and how President Donald Trump regularly dismisses and disparages military veterans originally ran with a small — but glaring — mistake, stating that Vindman was awarded a Purple Heart after being wounded by an IUD while on tour in Iraq.</p>
      <p>A correction to the story noted that Vindman was actually injured by an IED, or an improvised explosive device, a common weapon deployed in combat zones. An IUD, or intrauterine device, is <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud/what-are-the-disadvantages-of-iuds">a very effective birth control method</a> that can cause some pain and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5683155/">complications</a>, but rarely kills or maims.</p>
      <p>Screenshots of the correction started making their way around Twitter on Friday.</p>

      <p>Vindman testified during impeachment inquiries this week. He is a combat veteran who served multiple tours of duty, including a 2003 tour in Iraq, where he was injured by the IED and was awarded the Purple Heart, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/us/politics/who-is-alexander-vindman.html?module=inline">The New York Times. </a></p>
      <p>Vindman and his family immigrated to the US when he was 3 from Ukraine. In his service in the Trump administration's National Security Council, Vindman listened in on the July 25 phone call between Trump and the newly-elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and became alarmed that Trump was asking the leader of a foreign country to investigate a political rival. </p>
      <p>"I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/28/us/politics/Alexander-Vindman-trump-impeachment.html">he told House impeachment investigators</a>, "and I was worried about the implications for the US government's support of Ukraine."</p>
