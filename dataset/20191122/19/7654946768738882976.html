      <h1>Tiger-Cats vs. Blue Bombers prediction, line: Take the Over</h1>

      <p>The 107th edition of the CFL Grey Cup is Sunday at McMahon Stadium in Calgary as the East Division champion Hamilton Tiger-Cats face the West Division champion Winnipeg Blue Bombers (6 p.m., ESPN2).</p>
      <p>These teams have suffered through the longest Grey Cup title droughts. Hamilton’s last Grey Cup victory came in 1999, Winnipeg’s 1990.</p>
      <p>The forecast is for clear skies, light wind and a high in the mid-40s — not as cold as it could be at this time of year.</p>
      <p>The Tiger-Cats had the league’s best record at 15-3 and have a complete team. It has been terrific on offense, with QB Dane Evans and a slew of weapons led by WR Brandon Banks. The Ticats also have an elite offensive line.</p>
      <p>The Blue Bombers enjoyed a late-season offensive uptick after they acquired veteran QB Zach Collaros in a trade, giving them an answer for their passing game after a season-ending injury to Week 1 starter Matt Nichols.</p>
      <p><b>The play:</b> Over 52. Both teams have strong offenses and have shown the ability to score on defense and special teams.</p>
