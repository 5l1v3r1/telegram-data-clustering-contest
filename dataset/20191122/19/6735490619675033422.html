      <p>Caitlyn Jenner’s mother just doesn’t get “Keeping Up with the Kardashians”.</p>

      <p>“I wasn’t fond of that program,” she said. “There was no plot, and why it was such a hit I’ll never know … and I guess it still is!”</p>
      <p>Esther also added that she can’t bring herself to actually watch the show due to Kris Jenner’s treatment of Caitlyn before her transition.</p>
      <p>“She made him look like a milquetoast man,” Esther said.</p>

      <p>She added that she is very supportive of Caitlyn’s transition, adding that being trans “is nothing she asked for, it’s a condition and it starts in the mother’s womb.”</p>
      <p>Many took Esther’s words as a sign that Caitlyn and Kris were not on good terms but Caitlyn’s rep has denied any hard feelings.</p>
      <p>“Caitlyn’s team adamantly denies her mother’s statements as they do not represent Caitlyn’s sentiments or feelings towards the show or Kris Jenner,” a statement provided to <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/caitlyn-jenner-is-on-great-terms-with-ex-kris-jenner/"><i>US Weekly</i> </a>read. “Caitlyn has time and time again said that the show is the best thing that has happened to their family, and is on great terms with Kris. Her team was shocked – and never consulted – to hear of Esther speaking to press.”</p>
