        <b>Members of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) working in RTÉ have called on the state broadcaster to cut the salaries of its top presenters and managers immediately.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's part of a resolution which was backed at an on-campus NUJ meeting held on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Journalists in the organisation said current salary levels were "indefensible".</p>
      <p>The resolution said "The RTÉ sub-branch notes the gravity of the current financial crisis that has enveloped the organisation.</p>
      <p>"It notes that RTÉ has referred to the crisis as an 'existential' one, and it accepts this description.</p>
      <p>"In light of the existential nature of this crisis we believe that it is now more than ever indefensible that RTÉ continues to pay exorbitant salaries of up to close to half a million euro to a small number of people in this organisation.</p>
      <p>"We understand the public anger at this and believe that that anger is justified."</p>
      <p>It also cited a new law in the Netherlands which prevents anyone working in the public or semi-public sector from earning more than €187,000.</p>
      <p>This is done by comparing all top salaries to that of the country's prime minister.</p>
      <p>NUJ members added: "We believe that the RTÉ proposal to cut 15% off payments to its top contracted presenters does not go far enough.</p>
      <p>"We are calling on RTÉ management to immediately move to reduce the fees of the top presenters so that no one in the organisation is earning more than the top civil service salary, that of Secretary-General.</p>
      <p>"We believe this would be an important first step towards addressing the valid concerns felt by the public we serve."</p>
      <p>Earlier on this month, RTÉ <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/news/rte-200-jobs-pay-top-presenters-342322"><i>announced plans</i></a> to cut some 200 jobs as a part of plans to reduce projected costs by €60 million over three years.</p>
      <p>The RTÉ Guide will also be sold while the Limerick studio will be closed by 2020.</p>
