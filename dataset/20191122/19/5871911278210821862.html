      <h1>Listen: Audio leaks of Robert Kraft calling President Donald Trump 'divisive and horrible'</h1>

      <p>It’s known that Patriots owner Robert Kraft has been an avid Donald Trump supporter, but he apparently wasn’t always that way, according to some audio that recently leaked out.</p>
      <p>Kraft was heard speaking to a colleague at a league meeting back in 2017, in audio that was obtained by TMZ Sports. In it, Kraft criticizes POTUS, calling Trump both “divisive and horrible.”</p>
      <p>“I must tell you, I think these dialogues are great,” Kraft said. “But the elephant in the room now, in my opinion, is this kneeling, which every player has a right to do if they feel it’s right. The problem we have is, we have a president that will use that as fodder to do his mission that I don’t feel is in the best interest of the matter.</p>
      <p>“It’s divisive, and it’s horrible. And it’s actually the opposite of what you all are trying to do.”</p>

      <p>Looks like Kraft may be attempting to play both sides here; but you can’t please everyone.</p>
