      <p>Original 08/27/2019 11:15am:</p>
      <p>The mother of DeMarcus Cousins' son has filed a police report in Alabama, claiming that the famed athlete threatened to put a "bullet in [her] f**king head" if she didn't allow their son to attend his August 24 wedding. Cousins' ex, Christy West, provided alleged audio of the athlete threatening her over the phone. West claims Cousins made the threat on August 23, one day before he was set to marry Morgan Lang in Atlanta. </p>
      <p>A man, alleged to be Cousins, can be heard saying on the call, "I'm gonna ask you this one more time before I take it to another level. Can I have my son here, please?" West says, "No," and the man responded by saying, "I'm gonna make sure I put a bullet in your f**king head."</p>
      <p>West has requested a restraining order against Cousins, who she claims also told her that he would kill her "even if he didn't have to get his hands dirty doing it." She added that she would be open to Cousins having supervised visits with his son. </p>
