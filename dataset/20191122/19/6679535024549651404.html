      <p>They can only hear the world around them but their insight and their determination brought them lots of cheers at the District School Arts Festival on Friday.</p>
      <p>Hari Mohan and Mohammed Fayin, both visually challenged, left the audience impressed with their skills in the Mimicry event.</p>
      <p>Hari, a Plus One student at SMV Model HSS, Thampanoor, seized the first spot in the higher secondary category in mimicry while Mohammed secured A grade.</p>
      <p>Hari’s presentation was all about the happenings in a single day.</p>
      <p>Sounds from his immediate environment, be it the chirping of the birds, a journey in a bus, a crying child, trip to a beach, a temple festival, and Shaiju Damodaran’s football commentary on TV were all linked together by Hari in a script that was prepared by him.</p>
      <p>Though Hari has topped in mimicry in the Special School Kalotsavam four times, he is glad of his win in his first appearance at the District School Arts Festival.</p>
      <p>Mohammed, a student of Sivagiri higher secondary school, Varkala, too gave an impressive demonstration of his talents.</p>
      <p>He too made it to the festival on the strength of his determination.</p>
