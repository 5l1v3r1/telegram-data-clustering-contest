      <p>"It's really not worth it," to hug or kiss a baby if you're feeling ill, pediatrician Dr. Claudia Vicetti <a href="https://kwwl.com/news/waterloo-news/2019/11/21/local-pediatrician-warns-against-kissing-babies-during-flu-season/">told KWWL</a>. "In the wintertime, especially the older adults and older children, you may not feel sick right away or sick at all."</p>
      <p>An estimated 57,000 children under the age of 5 are hospitalized each year due to RSV infections, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infections often cause a mild illness with symptoms similar to the common cold, but it can also cause severe illnesses such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia.</p>
      <p>"Respiratory syncytial virus just causes a lot more inflammation and secretions in the airway than some of the other typical viruses," Dr. Tiffany Hill, a pediatrician at UT Health East Texas, <a href="https://www.cbs19.tv/article/news/local/doctors-warn-people-not-to-kiss-babies-if-they-feel-sick/501-617f8179-93d9-4025-badf-f4193bb107b8">told KYTX</a>. "In younger children, it can be more serious and cause a lot of issues and even hospitalizations."</p>
      <p>Each year, one or two infants out of every 100 who are fighting RSV infections and under 6 months of age require hospitalization due to the severity of their illness, CDC officials said. The hospital stays sometimes require intubation or mechanical ventilation to help a child breathe.</p>
      <p>"RSV creates lots and lots of mucus and their airwaves are tiny," pediatrician Stephanie Shults <a href="https://www.wbir.com/article/news/health/dont-kiss-babies-rsv-nearing-peak-season-in-east-tennessee/51-99f083a1-a9dc-4342-a862-e8a36fc45f2a">told WBIR</a>. "They don't know how to cough, they don't know how to blow their (noses)."</p>
      <p>Symptoms of RSV infections in infants include irritability, decreased activity, decreased appetite and apnea, according to the CDC.</p>
      <p>"You're looking more for respiratory effort," Shults <a href="https://www.wbir.com/article/news/health/dont-kiss-babies-rsv-nearing-peak-season-in-east-tennessee/51-99f083a1-a9dc-4342-a862-e8a36fc45f2a">told WBIR</a>. "If the child's breathing more than once a second, which is 60 times a minute, they're not drinking well (and) they're not urinating as much as normal."</p>
      <p>In adults, symptoms typically include a runny nose, a decrease in appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing. However, health officials said symptoms don't always surface in infected adults.</p>
      <p>Vicetti <a href="https://kwwl.com/news/waterloo-news/2019/11/21/local-pediatrician-warns-against-kissing-babies-during-flu-season/">told KWWL</a> that parents should take precautions and make sure people wash their hands before touching or holding their babies.</p>
      <p>"If you have a younger infant, you're really the stopping point for the illness," Hill <a href="https://www.cbs19.tv/article/news/local/doctors-warn-people-not-to-kiss-babies-if-they-feel-sick/501-617f8179-93d9-4025-badf-f4193bb107b8">told KYTX</a>. She recommended parents and caregivers get vaccinated and that they keep people who feel sick from making physical contact with their children.</p>
      <p>"It really is better for the baby," she said, <a href="https://www.cbs19.tv/article/news/local/doctors-warn-people-not-to-kiss-babies-if-they-feel-sick/501-617f8179-93d9-4025-badf-f4193bb107b8">according to KYTX</a>.</p>
