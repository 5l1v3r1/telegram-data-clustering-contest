      <p>The election of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State was on Friday upheld by the Court of Appeal sitting in Kaduna.</p>
      <p>In a unanimous ruling by the five-man panel of Appeal Court Judges led by Justice Tijjani Abubakar, the court said that the appeal filed by Abba Kabiru Yusuf and his party, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) lacks merit.</p>
      <p>Consequently, they dismissed the appeal in its entirety and affirmed that Governor Ganduje was elected by the majority of Kano voters.</p>
      <p>But counsel to the appellants, the PDP and Abba Kabiru Yusuf, Bashir Yusuf Muhammad said they will appeal the judgement.</p>
      <p>He said the reasons for the decisions arrived in the judgement had not been given.</p>
      <p>He further said, “We will get the full judgement to know the basis of the judgement before proceeding to the Supreme Court.”</p>
