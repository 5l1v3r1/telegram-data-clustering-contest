        <b>Donald Trump’s infamous childish handwriting is now a free font anyone can download, thanks to Mark Davis, a graphic designer at BuzzFeed and Font Bureau.</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are three interesting facts about Donald Trump: his incessant tweeting, he does not use computers (outside of his iPhone) and has the worse/funniest handwriting you would have ever seen.</p>
      <p>Now thanks to the success of a recent satirical article on BuzzFeed, the company decided to task <a href="https://twitter.com/markfonts">Mark Davis,</a> one of their graphic designers who also work for Font Bureau, to recreate Donald’s handwriting as a custom font. It is called Tiny Hand (!).</p>

      <p>What will you create?</p>
