      <p>(Reuters) - Bridgewater Associates’ Ray Dalio said on Friday his hedge fund does not have a net bet that the stock market will fall, taking issue with a story published earlier in the Wall Street Journal.</p>
      <p>The hedge fund has bet more than $1 billion that stock markets around the world will drop by March, the WSJ said in its report on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. (<a href="https://on.wsj.com/2pGbT53">on.wsj.com/2pGbT53</a>)</p>
      <p>The bet, assembled over a span of months and executed by a handful of Wall Street firms, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/GS.N">GS.N</a>) and Morgan Stanley (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/MS.N">MS.N</a>), would pay off for the world's biggest hedge fund if either the S&amp;P 500 <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.SPX">.SPX</a> or the Euro Stoxx 50 <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.STOXX50E">.STOXX50E</a> — or both — declines, the report had said.</p>
      <p>The bet is made up of put options, contracts that give investors the right to sell stocks at a specific price by a certain date. The options expire in March and currently represent one of the largest bearish bets against the market, the report added.</p>
      <p>“To convey us having a bearish view of the stock market would be misleading,” Dalio said in a statement.</p>
      <p>However, Dow Jones, the publisher of Wall Street Journal, said the article is based on interviews with multiple sources.</p>
      <p>“The article does not report, as Mr. Dalio says, that Bridgewater has a ‘net’ bearish position on the stock market,” a spokesman for Dow Jones said.</p>
      <p>“The article made clear that the trade could be a hedge for the firm’s significant long exposure to equity markets, among other possibilities.”</p>
