      <h1>Failure at Tottenham could leave Jose Mourinho with the baggage of yesterday's man</h1>
      <h2>The Portuguese manager brings great theatre but he is not the right fit for Tottenham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> doesn’t look like a match made in heaven.</p>
      <p>And the majority view seems to be that, like his previous jobs in England, it will end in tears.</p>
      <p>Whatever you say about the football his teams play – and he will be judged at Spurs on style as well as results – the Premier League is always a more fascinating landscape when Mourinho is at large.</p>
      <p>Talk is cheap, and after winning 20 major trophies in his managerial career Mourinho deserves the courtesy of analysis based on facts – so here goes.</p>
      <p>Take a look at his last 10 signings for Manchester United and judge for yourselves if they were good value:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lee Grant £1.5 million</li>
        <li>Diogo Dalot £19.8m</li>
        <li>Alexis Sanchez £30.6m (net value in swap deal)</li>
        <li>Victor Lindelof £31.5m</li>
        <li>Eric Bailly £34.2m</li>
        <li>Henrikh Mkhitaryan £37.8m</li>
        <li>Nemanja Matic £40.2m</li>
        <li>Fred £53.1m</li>
        <li>Romelu Lukaku £76.2m</li>
        <li>Paul Pogba £94.5m</li>
      </ul>

      <p>That’s £419.4 million in total – of those 10 signings, how many have been a success at Old Trafford?</p>
      <p>Hardly any – you can make a case for Lukaku being decent for one season, and maybe that Lindelof has won some people over, but even Pogba’s best moment has been winning the World Cup with France.</p>
      <p>The fact remains, however, that since he won the Champions League with Porto in 2004, Mourinho has spent big wherever he has worked – an eye-watering £1.4 billion in total.</p>
      <p>Look at the numbers: Porto £19.7m, Chelsea (2004-07) £334m, Inter Milan £140m, Real Madrid £168m, Chelsea (2013-15) £319m, United £419.4m.</p>
      <p>Set that expensive spending habit against Mauricio Pochettino leading Tottenham to the Champions League final without spending a penny in two transfer windows and you can see the gap Mourinho will have to bridge at Spurs.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The bottom line, for Pochettino, is that he didn’t win a trophy in five-and-a-half years and a top-four finish this year looks highly unlikely because Tottenham have slipped 11 points beyond the dotted line after 12 games already.</p>
      <p>I thought Pochettino did an outstanding job, changing a whole club’s mindset, overseeing the move into a £1 billion new stadium without money to spend and bringing young players like Harry Winks into first-team prominence.</p>
      <p>Four consecutive top-four finishes is no mean feat.</p>
      <p>And there will be a few managers, both in England and abroad, who will be feeling less secure in their jobs knowing Pochettino is out there and available.</p>
      <p>Without jumping on the bandwagon, I just don’t see Mourinho as the right fit for Tottenham.</p>

      <p>They are proud of their tradition for flair and expansive football at Spurs. With respect, United were laboured and shocking in the four months leading up to his exit from Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Yes, United finished runners-up to Manchester City in 2018 – a distant 19 points behind the champions... yet Pochettino got much closer to the title the year before, finishing seven points behind Chelsea.</p>
      <p>Mourinho’s record as a winner speaks for itself, and you don’t win three Premier League titles at Chelsea or the Champions League with two different clubs (Porto and Inter) if you don’t know football.</p>
      <p>But I was around the training ground at Carrington during Mourinho’s time at United, and there were people at the club who were not sorry to see the back of him.</p>
      <p>At Tottenham, he is allegedly going to be on £88,000-a-week more than any of the players. If that is the case, Harry Kane should be going straight in to see the chairman on Monday morning to ask for a pay rise.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And younger players, like Winks and Ryan Sessegnon, are entitled to fear for their chances of regular places in the starting XI because Mourinho’s record of investing in youth is patchy at best.</p>
      <p>Is his appointment a better bet than leaving Pochettino in place?</p>
      <p>Only, in my opinion, if Mourinho finishes in the top four and wins a trophy.</p>
      <p>Pochettino turned Spurs into a top-four club, so the only way Mourinho can improve on that is to keep qualifying for the Champions League and win trophies.</p>
      <p>But Spurs are not going to win the title or the Champions League while Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola are calling the tune at Liverpool and Manchester City.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Klopp and Guardiola are the special ones now – not Mourinho.</p>
      <p>That leaves the FA Cup – somehow, Spurs managed to get knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Colchester – and if the big guns play their strongest hands, I don’t see Tottenham winning that competition, either.</p>
      <p>So will Jose be hailed as a success if he wins the Carabao Cup?</p>
      <p>If his appointment has the look of short-termism – win football matches now, worry about the style later – Mourinho’s best hope is to make an immediate impact.</p>
      <p>But even there, at face value his powers of instant transformation appear to be waning. Look at his record over the first 20 league games at his previous clubs at judge for yourself.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Porto: P20 W15 D3 L2</li>
        <li>Chelsea P20 W15 D4 L1</li>
        <li>Inter P20 W14 D4 L2</li>
        <li>Real Madrid P20 W16 D3 L1</li>
        <li>Chelsea P20 W13 D4 L3</li>
        <li>United P20 W11 D6 L3</li>
      </ul>

      <p>And the goals are not as plentiful, either: At Real Madrid, Mourinho’s team scored 48 goals in his first 20 games, at Chelsea it was 38 and at United it was down to 31.</p>
      <p>This has the air of Mourinho’s last stand at a big club.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard at Chelsea and Brendan Rodgers at Leicester are the Premier League’s most exciting shows after Liverpool and City.</p>
      <p>As ever, Mourinho will be great theatre, always worth a listen and it’s great to have him back.</p>
      <p>He wasn’t bigger than Real Madrid or Manchester United, but is he bigger than Tottenham? Are Spurs a bigger club now because they have landed Mourinho as their manager?</p>
      <p>He was quick to remind the media that he has never lost a Champions League final – which is true enough. But he has lost six semi-finals.</p>
      <p>On the night Tottenham beat his United side 3-0 at Old Trafford 15 months ago, Spurs fans were serenading Jose with the taunt: “You’re not special any more.”</p>
      <p>We’re about to find out if that’s true. If Mourinho cannot lift Tottenham’s fortunes, he will have the baggage of yesterday’s man.</p>
