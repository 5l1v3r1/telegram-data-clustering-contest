      <p>Sylvester Stallone (<i>Rocky</i>) teamed up with Oscar-winning director Deirdre Fenton (<i>30 for 30</i>) to relive <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/6/1/18649109/anthony-joshua-vs-andy-ruiz-jr-upset-win-boxing-news">Anthony Joshua vs. Andy Ruiz</a> in the DAZN documentary <i>ONE NIGHT: JOSHUA vs RUIZ</i>.</p>
      <p>The documentary includes interviews with Ruiz, Joshua, Stallone, Michael Strahan, “Sugar” Ray Leonard, Evander Holyfield, Gerry Cooney and Hans “Dolph” Lundgren. Perhaps most interesting, the film also boasts interviews with two men who were involved in another historic heavyweight upset: Mike Tyson and Buster Douglas.</p>
