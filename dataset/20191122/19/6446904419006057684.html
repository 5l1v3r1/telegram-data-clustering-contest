      <p>JEREMY CORBYN PLEDGED to adopt a “neutral stance” in another EU referendum under Labour as he came under fire from voters during a televised grilling.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader was questioned over fears for businesses, anti-Semitism, misogyny, freedom of speech and his support of ousted Bolivia president Evo Morales during a special episode of BBC’s Question Time tonight.</p>
      <p>As they try to tip the balance in the campaign for the December 12 General Election, each leader was being quizzed for half-an-hour during the show hosted by Fiona Bruce in Sheffield.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn, who plans to re-nationalise key utilities and increase corporation tax, went first and faced a barrage of tough questioning and groans.</p>
      <p>He made his clearest comment to date over how he would act in another referendum, which Labour plans to hold between a new deal and the option to Remain within six months of taking power.</p>
      <p>Having been asked how anyone could vote Labour without knowing what outcome he would campaign for, Mr Corbyn said that he would start by negotiating a “credible” Leave deal before he was interrupted by laughing.</p>
      <p>“My role and the role of our government will be to ensure that that referendum is held in a fair atmosphere and we will abide by the result of it,” he continued.</p>
      <p>“And I will adopt, as prime minister, if I am at the time, a neutral stance so that I can credibly carry out the results of that to bring communities and country together rather than continuing an endless debate about the EU and Brexit.”</p>
