      <h1>Teen employee at Utah’s Zion National Park falls to her death</h1>

      <p>A Maine teen who worked at Utah’s Zion National Park was found dead at the base of a 1,488-foot-tall rock tower in the park, according to authorities and a new report.</p>
      <p>The body of Savannah McTague, 19, who worked as a Xanterra concession employee in the Zion Lodge, was discovered Thursday morning beneath the rock formation known as Angel’s Landing in Zion National Park, officials said, <a href="https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2019/11/21/rmw-body-of-missing-hiker-found-below-angels-landing/#.XdgmSOhKiUk">according to local outlet St. George News</a>.</p>
      <p>McTague had been hiking with two co-workers late Wednesday afternoon when her colleagues frantically notified park authorities around 5:30 p.m. that she was missing and that they suspected she’d fallen, the outlet reported.</p>
      <p>Zion National Park rangers notified the Washington County Sheriff’s Office around 7:40 p.m. about a report of someone falling from the trail, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WCSOUT/photos/a.10150639881030471/10162669987830471/?type=3&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBGQ9-RaQSTGbkoEu4LXZ7nYkuBEQ1dmGzc8oOIapxvZtNZQRstFIwjUUw1RMZJrkgkyEkY1h5tWcjNbUTOQCwchyQYhPhSlVf8ewjEq9PAggfaa3uQ8FyMrwbwVgU0wtk6cOA3m8ni-VNNZYfASntgav9IQLy-3AVKusZdc3Q7FMVD0mFDSCHLtPzZjRdbNTG61OPTIUMsjlgVC7nLVfpcZRA2LjU4l4ce1l_Sk-4sR8e6SdlPkwZx9O__qEEws1vHUHvXvPvvFrE4GfkocdpvTbpUpBUt9Wfsmn-n1SFwVrnj2sfUEJ5aCN7FM5yKN0N7NahvY17JidTxcHyE&amp;__tn__=-R">according to a Facebook post</a>.</p>
      <p>“Our deepest condolences go out to the McTague family and friends,” park superintendent Jeff Bradybaugh said in a press release obtained by St. George News. “Savannah was part of the Zion family. This fatality has been especially hard on Zion Lodge and park staff.”</p>
      <p>The national park and the sheriff’s office are continuing to investigate.</p>
      <p>The trail had just reopened Tuesday after being closed for several days following a rockfall. Park officials urged hikers to be careful, as a winter storm was rolling in.</p>
      <p>Two hikers have died on the trail over the past two years.</p>
