      <p>A young McDonald’s worker was viciously assaulted by four boys with a brick for refusing to give them free food, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>Charm Sullivan, 17, was left with a badly-swollen face that required hospital treatment after the attack at a McDonald’s near Hunting Park in Philadelphia on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Charm’s cousin Khadijah Lovett said: ‘She’s hurt,” Lovett said. “The only thing she keeps saying is she doesn’t know. Why her. Why her?</p>
      <p>‘They assaulted her several times.</p>
      <p>‘They hit her with a brick in front of McDonald’s.</p>

      <p>Charm says she was serving behind the counter when the boys started pestering her, and that they jumped her when she went to use the bathroom.</p>
      <p>The assault continued outside, and ended with the teenager laying unconscious between two parked cars, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>Charm suffered swollen lips and a busted right eye in the attack, and has now vowed never to return to the McDonald’s where she was assaulted.</p>
