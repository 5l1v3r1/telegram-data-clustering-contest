      <p><b>DIRIYAH —</b> Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman, deputy premier and minister of defense, witnessed on Friday the second round of ABB FIA Formula E Championship for Electric Cars at Diriyah City.<br/><br/>The event is being organized by the International Automobile Federation and has sparked the start of events of the Diriyah Season Festival, Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said Friday.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Audi-powered Briton Sam Bird clinched the first win in the Kingdom, leading Posche and Mercedes as the battle of the German powerhouses continues after a spectacular season opener in Saudi Arabia.<br/><br/>Envision Virgin Racing's Bird scooped the first win of the season, leading TAG Heuer Porsche's Andre Lotterer and Mercedes-Benz EQ's Stoffel Vandoorne in third. Starting on Pole, BMW i Andretti Motorsport's Alex Sims pulled away as the lights went out on the season opener, leaving both Mercedes-Benz EQ drivers Vandoorne and Nyck de Vries in second and third.<br/><br/>Just five minutes into the race, disaster struck for Nissan e.dams' Sebastien Buemi, who stopped on track while the grid passed by. Unable to restart his car, the Swiss driver retired from the race.<br/><br/>After a number of attempts from Bird to pass Rokit Venturi Racing's Edoardo Mortara and move towards a podium finish, the Brit passed the Swiss driver with 30 minutes left on the clock.<br/><br/>Moving up from 16, Audi Sport Abt Schaeffler's Daniel Abt passed NIO 333's Oliver Turvey in a bid to improve the German manufacturers start to the season. Moments later, Mahindra Racing's Pascal Wehrlein (in 12th) clocked the fastest lap.<br/><br/>Still locked into 11th, reigning champion and DS Techeetah driver Jean-Eric Vergne showed no sign of making his way into the points. With two titles to his name, the pressure is on for the Frenchman as he looks to clinch a third at the end of the 2019/20 season.<br/><br/>Leading the way, Sims kept the two Mercedes drivers at bay in his BWM as the German powerhouses battled for the win. Close behind was Bird, followed by Andre Lotterer in fifth. With 17 minutes left of the race, reigning champ Vergne retired, returning to the pits with damage to the front wheel of his car.<br/><br/>Coming off the start/finish straight, a patient Vandoorne made his move on race leader Sims, taking the lead through Turn 18 and 19. At the same time, Bird attacked, passing Sims to move into second. Dropping back further still, Lotterer moved into third, knocking Sims off a potential podium finish.<br/><br/>Not content with a second place finish, Bird attacked Vandoorne with ten minutes remaining. Taking the lead in his Audi-powered car, the Brit handed it to new entrants Mercedes and Porsche as Lotterer remained in third.<br/><br/>After working his way up the grid, Nissan e.dams' Oliver Rowland advanced on Sims in fourth, passing the BMW driver with six minutes to spare. Coming into Turn 5, Audi's Daniel Abt failed to stop his car after a collision with Antonio Felix da Costa (BMW) and was left stranded after colliding with the wall.<br/><br/>Bird, maintaining his lead, held out to collect the first win of the season after a spectacular race. Trailing the Brit was Lotterer in second, followed by Vandoorne in third. — SPA/SG</p>
