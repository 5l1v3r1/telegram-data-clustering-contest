      <p>My 16-year-old introduced me to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boomershumor/">r/boomershumor</a>, a subreddit dedicated the the kinds of cartoons boomers enjoy sending as attachments in emails (usually address to dozens of people because they don't know about the bcc: field). The jokes are usually about fear of technology, getting drunk on wine, decrepitude, creepy sex humor, “I hate my wife” jokes, and tiresome misogyny/homophobia/transphobia (the last two categories were identified by <a href="https://bbs.boingboing.net/t/my-new-favorite-subreddit-is-r-boomershumor/155862/5?u=markfrauenfelder">DonatellaNobody</a>).</p>
