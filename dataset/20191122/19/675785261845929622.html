      <h1>Worrying about paying for cancer treatment must never be an option - vote Labour</h1>
      <h2>Author, mum and cancer fighter Roisin Pelan is urging everyone to protect our NHS</h2>

      <p>The majority of us have lived knowing no other way.</p>
      <p>The NHS is something we naturally take for granted.</p>
      <p>When I was diagnosed, a lot of things crossed my mind….my daughter, my partner, my friends and family, but never…what if I can’t afford chemotherapy?</p>
      <p>Or an oncologist or surgery, recovery, medicine etc that was all handed to me, no questions asked.</p>
      <p>Just imagine for a moment, you’re given this diagnosis.</p>
      <p>You’re told you have cancer, you think of your children at home and how on earth they will cope and the next thing that pops into your head is …s***, how the hell am I going to afford to stay alive?</p>

      <p>It feels so far away from our reality because it’s never been an issue. It’s hard to picture.</p>
      <p>Yet there’s people from other countries screaming out, warning us…do not let your NHS go, people who live with a private healthcare system/business and they would do anything to have what we have.</p>
      <p>Americans cannot believe we get this service with no fee whatsoever!</p>
      <p>I’m in a breast cancer forum where the majority of members are living in the US. I’ve heard stories of bankruptcy because people cannot afford to just stay alive.</p>
      <p>A woman this week told me she couldn’t go for her follow up treatment because she didn’t have the money and she HAD insurance.</p>

      <p>Another lady told me that she was thousands upon thousands in debt and the money had now gone to a debt collectors. She’ll probably lose her home.</p>
      <p>I am absolutely terrified of this general election. I along with millions of us in the UK would be UNINSURABLE.</p>
      <p>I do not know how I will stay alive. The pharmaceutical companies are inhumane.</p>
      <p>The cost of drugs is a crime. Finding a new lifesaving drug is treasure for the rich and misery for the poor who can't afford them.</p>
      <p>It isn’t fair and it is not right. The massive majority of the press are screaming out about the Labour party.</p>
      <p>They’re terrified of Jeremy Corbyn because of absolutely everything he has ever stood for.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>All we hear is “he’s dangerous” (he’s not) or “he’s friends with the IRA” (he had meetings with them just as the Conservatives did BUT he was trying to secure talks towards a peaceful agreement) or “he’s an anti-semite” (he’s the least racist politician I’ve ever known).</p>
      <p> A lot of Farage, Johnson and Robinson fans have that as the main reason they don’t like/trust him.</p>
      <p>Most people who preach this rubbish only believe it because they read it.</p>
      <p>I’ve found that getting stressed and frankly pissed off at these people just does no-one any good.</p>
      <p>They don’t want to be convinced that there’s a better choice than another Tory government. They’d rather believe that JC is really a ‘baddy’.</p>
      <p>There really is no point in me rhyming off facts and figures to people who just don’t want to listen but I hope with all my heart that people will look at the bigger picture.</p>

      <p>Do you truly believe another Tory government is going to be good for you?</p>
      <p>For your parents, your children, YOUR NHS? Do you think it’s going to get better if the Tories win the election?</p>
      <p>How do you think it will get worse if Corbyn gets in?</p>
      <p>I keep hearing, “I would vote for Labour if Jeremy Corbyn wasn’t the leader.”</p>
      <p>Firstly that’s b*******….</p>
      <p>Anyone with the same morals and hopes as JC are always going to be hounded by the press.</p>
      <p>Secondly, are you willing to watch the NHS crumble completely or for your children to have a second class education or for your parents to be stuck without any access to social care as they age?</p>
      <p>Or for the planet to self implode whilst our precious children are alive?</p>
      <p>THIS IS NOT A DRILL. It’s not the end of the world to change your mind or to admit that maybe, just maybe you’ve been sold an absolute pack of lies.</p>
      <p>Please…VOTE LABOUR.</p>
