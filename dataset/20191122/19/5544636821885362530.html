      <p>Convener of #RevolutionNow Movement, <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/news">Omoyele Sowore</a>, has filed a suit against the Department of State Services (DSS) challenging his detention.</p>
      <p>The human rights activist asked a federal high court to award N500 million in his favour as cost against the secret police for the violation of his rights.</p>
      <p>The suit marked FHC/ABJ /CS/1409/2019 is dated November 20.</p>
      <p>The reliefs sought by Sowore are: “A declaration that the detention of the applicant from November 7, 2019 till date in violation of the order for his release made on November 6, 2019 is illegal as it violates his fundamental right to liberty guaranteed by Section 35 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and Article 6 of African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (Ratification and Enforcement Act (CAP A10) laws of the federation of Nigeria 2004.</p>
      <p>”An order of this court compelling the respondents to pay to the applicant the sum of N500,000, 000, 00 ( five hundred million naira) as general and aggravated damages for the illegal violation of the applicant’s fundamental right to life, dignity of his person, fair hearing, health, freedom of movement and freedom of association.</p>
      <p>“An order of perpetual injunction restraining the respondents from further violating the applicant’s fundamental rights in any manner whatsoever and however without lawful justification.”</p>
      <p>The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, was joined in the suit.</p>
      <p>Since being arrested in August over his planned protest, Sowore has been in detention.</p>
      <p>The DSS has refused to release him despite a court order.</p>
