        <figcaption>A woman was attacked on a pathway in Livingston this morning</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>She was walking to work along a pathway beside Craigswood Sports Centre at the Houston Industrial Estate when the thug struck.</p>
      <p>He leapt out at her and attacked her but fled in the direction of the playing fields after she began to fight him off.</p>
      <p>The woman was terrified by the shock attack and left with some minor injuries.</p>
      <p>The man is described as 5ft8in and had a strong body odour.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Nick Brookfield said: “This was an unprovoked attack, and although the woman received only minor injuries, she is badly shaken.</p>
      <p>"These kinds of attacks will not be tolerated and we are conducting extensive enquiries to find who is responsible.</p>
      <p>“The area near to where this attack took place would have been busy early in the morning and I would appeal to anyone who may have been driving around the time of the assault to look and see if they have any dash-cam footage.</p>
      <p>“We would also like to speak to anyone else in the area before and after the attack to get in touch if they saw something suspicious on the road, along the path and near the playing fields and sports centre.</p>
      <p>“Anyone with information should call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 0556 of Friday, 22 November. Or make a call anonymously to the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”</p>
