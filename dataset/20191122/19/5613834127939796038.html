      <p>Last year, a man by the name of <b>Steven Newland</b> turned four (fake) Christmas trees into “<b>TreeZilla</b>,” a towering holiday monstrosity shaped like the King of the Monsters. Wrapped up in lights and equipped with glowing red eyes and the ability to breathe fog machine smoke, “TreeZilla” features plastic teeth and paper claws, his head adorned with a Santa hat.</p>
      <p>The badass custom Christmas tree, which Newland originally shared through a YouTube video last December, is now up for auction through the New Zealand-based site Trade Me!</p>
      <p>At the time of writing this article, “TreeZilla” has passed the reserve amount with a current top bid of $305, and the auction is set to run until November 27th at 7:30pm.</p>
      <p>The tree measures approximately 6-feet tall (1.8m), and Newland notes that the winning bidder will also become the new owner of a set of adorable Godzilla stockings.</p>
