      <h1>Buhari rules out seeking third term</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:28:03+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:28</time> by <a rel="author">Timileyin Omilana</a></address>
      <p>Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari Friday said he has no intention to seek a third term as the leader of Africa’s largest economy.</p>
      <p>Nigerian constitution permits a maximum of two terms for governors and president. But rumours were rife that Buhari, who once led the country as a general, may seek another term.</p>
      <p>For him to do that, the constitution will need to be amended. But the president ultimately ruled that out on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>“I said you should read the Constitution because I am not going to make a mistake,” Buhari said at the meeting of the National Executive Council of the ruling All Progressives Congress.</p>
      <p>“Besides the age, I am not going to contest for third term because I will go by the Constitution. The Constitution says two-terms. I’m going to be frank here because I won’t be needing anybody’s vote.”</p>
