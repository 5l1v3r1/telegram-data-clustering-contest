      <p>A mum has shared pictures of herself weeping 'tears of blood' after allegedly being beaten by a barmaid.</p>
      <p>Anja Housden-Brooks, 40, suffered a broken nose, shattered cheekbones and a split tear duct in the attack on Saturday.</p>
      <p>She says she was battered 'out of the blue' by a member of staff at a bar in Southend, Essex, after having drinks with pals.</p>
      <p>The bar's owner refused to comment today, but Essex Police confirmed they are investigating an allegation of assault.</p>
      <p>Anja, 40, said: "I was left concussed and in total shock, with blood streaming from my damaged tear duct.</p>
      <p>"I've been sleeping like the dead all week, my front teeth are all caved in and my dentist thinks I'll lose at least one."</p>

      <p>Mum-of-three Anja said she was running errands in Southend on Saturday evening when she bumped into a friend by chance.</p>
      <p>She joined the pal who was meeting a group of friends at The Venue Bar and drank two gin and tonics.</p>
      <p>"There was a wider group of about ten of us. We were laughing a joking and maybe being a bit loud - but no more than any other town centre bar on a Saturday evening," said Anja.</p>
      <p>"A woman working behind the bar came over a couple of times and kept telling us to keep the noise down.</p>
      <p>"In the end she singled me out and told me I would have to leave because I was being too noisy.</p>

      <p>"I told her I'd done nothing wrong and stood my ground. She didn't like it all and kept giving me evil looks from behind the bar, but I just ignored her."</p>
      <p>Anja says she left about 15 minutes later to return home.</p>
      <p>"I admit that I did have a couple of choice words for her as I left," she says.</p>
      <p>"As I reached the door of the bar, my face exploded in pain. This bar worker was raining punches on me.</p>

      <p>"I begged her to stop, but she just kept hitting me. It was over in minutes, but felt like a lifetime."</p>
      <p>Anja says she staggered into the street where a motorist took pity on her and drove her home.</p>
      <p>She said: "This guy saw me slumped in a heap against the wall. I'm so grateful to him. He said I should go to hospital but I just wanted to be with my family."</p>
      <p>Anja attended Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford the next day.</p>
      <p>X-rays revealed fractures to her nose and one cheekbone.</p>

      <p>At a follow up appointment, doctors discovered that in fact both cheekbones had been broken.</p>
      <p>Anja stated: "They had to glue my tear duct back together to stop the bleeding.</p>
      <p>"I've been to see my dentist, too, and the nerve's been damaged in one tooth. It's very wobbly and I've been warned to expect it to fall out any time."</p>
