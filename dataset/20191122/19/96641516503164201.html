      <p>It's been a rough month for customers who care about their privacy, with data breaches affecting businesses as diverse as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/19/macys-card-skimming-hack/">high-end department stores</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/03/camgirl-sites-exposed-data-for-millions-of-users/">camgirl websites</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/31/hackers-breached-some-of-the-webs-most-popular-domain-registrar/">online domain registrars</a>. Yet another cybersecurity issue has allowed hackers to access data about prepaid customers of popular US and European telecom brand <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/07/t-mobile-teases-15-5g-prepaid-plan/">T-Mobile</a>, as revealed by blog <a href="https://www.tmonews.com/2019/11/t-mobile-data-breach-prepaid-customers/"><i>TmoNews</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Affected customers in the US are being notified via a text message which directs them to <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/customers/6305378822">a page</a> on T-Mobile's website. "Our Cybersecurity team discovered and shut down malicious, unauthorized access to some information related to your T-Mobile prepaid wireless account," the page reads.</p>
      <p>Hackers were able to access data including names and billing addresses, phone numbers, account numbers and information about what plans and features that customers chose. However, T-Mobile assures customers that no financial data such as credit card information, social security numbers or passwords were compromised.</p>
      <p>The company says it has reported the breach to the authorities and that it has "a number of safeguards in place to protect your personal information from unauthorized access."</p>
      <p><i>TmoNews </i>reached out to the company to find out how many customers' information was compromised. T-Mobile reportedly responded that a "very small single digit percentage" of users were affected.</p>
