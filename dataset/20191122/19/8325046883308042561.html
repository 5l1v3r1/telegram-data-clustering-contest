      <p>Jeffree Star is defending his brand after people said eye-shadow palettes from the Shane Dawson x Jeffree Star Cosmetics collaboration contained hair-like fibers.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the beauty mogul took to social media with a statement regarding his brand. On Twitter, he said a “few dozen people” out of 1.1 million received eye shadows with ribbon fibers from a factory machine embedded inside. Star also shared a similar sentiment on Instagram.</p>
      <p>“Hey everyone, it’s come to our attention that a few dozen people out of 1.1 million palettes produced, have a few ribbon fibers embedded in their products,” Star wrote. “The lab has done a full investigation &amp; we found the issue. I pride myself on quality and fully apologize for this error.”</p>

      <h3>Jeffree Star shared more details about the fibers in his eye-shadow palettes on Instagram</h3>
      <p>In an Instagram story posted on Friday, Star addressed videos – which show people pulling hair-like fibers out of their eye-shadow palettes – that have recently been posted on Twitter. The YouTuber said he aimed to be “fully transparent” with his customers.</p>
      <p>“Now over the last few days, I have been investigating these claims with my lab and I have a full answer and I am excited to share it with you guys so everyone can see what exactly happened,” Star said.</p>
      <p>“35 palettes out of 1.1 million have had issues,” Star said. “That is 0.000%.”</p>

      <h3>In his Instagram video, Star said it’s ‘not fair’ to compare his makeup to products made by Jaclyn Hill</h3>
      <p>In June, beauty YouTuber Jaclyn Hill released a line of lipsticks, which many people said <a href="https://www.insider.com/jaclyn-hill-cosmetics-broken-lipstick-accusations-2019-6">arrived damaged</a> and caused <a href="https://www.insider.com/people-say-had-reactions-to-jaclyn-cosmetics-lipstick-2019-6">swelling on the lips</a>. People also said the makeup contained small beads, fibers, and other strange materials.</p>
      <p>Now, some people are comparing the fibers found in Star’s eye-shadow palettes to Hill’s previous launch. Star doesn’t think the comparisons are fair, and says “a lot of people are trying to come for” himself and Dawson.</p>
      <p>“Guys, I heard about this a week ago,” Star said. “I am fully investigating everything and a lot of people are trying to put this next to the Jaclyn Hill lipstick launch. You guys, stop.”</p>
      <p>“I address everything fully,” he continued. “I’m not blocking anyone, I’m not deleting my social-media account, and that’s no shade, but that’s not how I handle things. I am always fully transparent. So to compare my situation to someone else’s, it just is not fair.”</p>
      <p>Representatives for Jaclyn Hill did not immediately respond to Insider’s request for comment.</p>

      <h3>To confirm that his palettes are safe to use, Star shared a video taken inside his makeup lab</h3>
      <p>The video shows a factory worker pressing a red button, which drops a metal press down onto eye-shadow pans. In between the makeup and machine is a white sheet made from fibers.</p>
      <p>“So when they are pressing the eye shadows with all the pans, they put a piece of ribbon and material in between the metal and the eye shadows and they are pressing it in between,” Star explained.</p>

      <p>He continued to say that if the sheet “is not changed out enough,” there can “be a little fraying.”</p>
      <p>“Now, it’s not toxic, it’s completely safe, but it’s still disgusting,” Star said. “It does not represent my brand. So anyone that has had that issue, please of course email customer care and anyone that already has, full refund, brand new palette – it’s just that easy.”</p>
      <p>Star also shared the clip on Twitter, writing: “Here is a clip from the lab of how we press the eyeshadows. Moving forward my manufacturer will make sure this never happens again and have put in place several precautions and steps to avoid the ribbon issue. You all know how serious I take my company, thank you for listening.”</p>

      <h3>The makeup mogul has not yet addressed people who say they’ve received broken palettes</h3>
      <p>In addition to videos that show fibers in Star’s eye-shadow palettes, some people also say their products <a href="https://www.insider.com/jeffree-star-shane-dawson-broken-makeup-2019-11">have arrived broken in pieces</a>.</p>
      <p>On Twitter, people have shared photos and videos that show what their palettes looked like after opening them for the first time, with multiple people saying that the shade Sleep Paralysis arrived broken.</p>
      <p>Many of those who said they received broken palettes appear to have ordered the products from Beauty Bay, a UK retailer that sells Jeffree Star Cosmetics.</p>
