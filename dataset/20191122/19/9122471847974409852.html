      <h1>USC vs. UCLA: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:09:19+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>USC head coach Clay Helton’s seat is burning hot right now. The Trojans’ 3-3 start to the season didn’t do him any favors. But USC is 4-1 over its last five games and up to No. 23 in the latest <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-12">College Football Playoff top 25</a>. Helton and the Trojans will look to build that momentum on Saturday against UCLA.</p>
      <p>This hasn’t been the season most Trojans fans were hoping for. But the team has a chance to finish the regular season with eight wins, a feat which didn’t seem possible at the halfway point of the season. UCLA hopes to spoil USC’s day at the Coliseum on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Chip Kelly experiment has shown signs of promise this year. But the Bruins sit at 4-6 and must win their final two games to become bowl game eligible. The USC-UCLA rivalry always brings surprises, and Kelly will most surely have a few tricks up his sleeve against the Trojans.</p>
