      <p>For a surfer, the search for the perfect wave is never over.</p>
      <p>But surfing enthusiasts in Berlin no longer have to fly to far-flung beaches: they can find the wave of their dreams right on their doorstep.</p>
      <p>The German capital's first artificial surfing wave opens for business on Friday (November 22).</p>
      <p>A converted warehouse in the district of Lichtenberg is now home to "Wellenwerk", or "wave factory" in English.</p>
      <p>The wave is generated through water pressure as running water meets stagnant water. As co-founder Julius Niehus explains, it can be adjusted to any height up to 1.6 metres.</p>
      <p>The flow rate can also be specified, meaning the wave can be adapted to the needs of beginners, children and professionals alike.</p>
