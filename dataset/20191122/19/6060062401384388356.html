      <p>T-Mobile suffered a data breach earlier this month in which hackers accessed people's personal information, the company <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/customers/6305378822">confirmed</a> Friday.</p>
      <p>A malicious third party gained access to users' account information, including names, addresses, phone numbers, account numbers, and the type of cell phone plan they're on, according to T-Mobile's announcement.</p>
      <p>Financial information like credit card numbers were not compromised, and neither were social security number, the company said.</p>
      <p>A T-Mobile spokesperson told Business Insider that the breach affected T-Mobile prepaid accounts, and less than 1.5% of T-Mobile customers were impacted. </p>
      <h3>Am I affected by the T-Mobile data breach?</h3>
      <p>Only T-Mobile customers were affected, so if you use a different carrier, you're safe.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/cpni-breach-reporting-facility">FCC rules</a> require that T-Mobile notify people who were affected by the breach, and T-Mobile said it will notify all affected users "shortly." However, just because you didn't receive a notification doesn't mean you're safe — T-Mobile notes that it may not have notified you if it doesn't have your up-to-date contact information.</p>
      <p>If you're unsure whether you were affected, you can call 1-800-T-MOBILE to reach customer service.</p>
