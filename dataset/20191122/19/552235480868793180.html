      <h1>End of an era as Ian Cashmore cash's in his chips in juniors - Loony Joons</h1>
      <h2>Kilwinning Rangers legend is walking away from the grade after almost two goal-laden decades.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Twitter can be a strange place. Forgive me for stating the bleeding obvious.</p>
      <p>But in one of its friendlier eccentricities the social media platform does manage to create fraternities of people to the point where you can feel like eternal pals … without ever having actually met each other.</p>
      <p>Case in point Ian Cashmore - modern day junior football legend and man of many teams.</p>
      <p>There’s apparently a saying in American sports circles that Jack Nicklaus has had more clubs than Ian Cashmore.</p>
      <p>But while The Golden Bear enjoyed great success in tearing up Ayrshire’s finest golf courses he can have nothing on the successes enjoyed in those parts by the ‘Goalden Bear’ of Kilwinning, Ardrossan, Dalry, Cumnock, Girvan, Glenafton, Ayr United …</p>

      <p>... the list goes on.</p>
      <p>So it was with a huge sense of sadness that this week Cashy - who I eventually met in person as he was sticking a goal past me in a friendly down in Kilwinning - has announced his retirement from the junior game.</p>
      <p>The flame-haired frontman has torn up his ties with his hundred-and-somethingth club Ardrossan and taken a plunge into the amateur ranks with Dirrans FC where his big pal Ross Stewart has badgered him for years to help out.</p>
      <p>Cue Twitter meltdown with scores and scores of comments paying homage to the man dubbed the Cash Converter after he struck his 100th goal for Kilwinning Rangers a couple of years ago.</p>
      <p>Ardrossan’s post itself perfectly summed up the 36-year-old and his on-field legend.</p>
      <p>It said: “After 18 long years the referees of the Scottish juniors can take their ear plugs out on a Saturday. Top moaner in Scotland. Mair gold medals than Tom Daley for diving. But what a goalscorer.”</p>

      <p>What a striker indeed. In total he struck 118 times for the Buffs in three spells over five years. His junior total will be close to double that.</p>
      <p>But explaining his decision on the phone this week - I still don’t think he’d recognise me in the flesh despite that goal - Cashmore said: “I’m 36 and need to play games which wasn’t happening enough this season.</p>
      <p>“I had offers from the juniors but my mate Ross has been on at me for years to go and help Dirrans so now’s the right time.</p>
      <p>“I’ll miss the banter from the fans in the juniors. It can be pretty impressive.</p>
      <p>"I always got branded a diver! I've not got a clue what they are on about ... I was just right good at winning fouls!</p>
      <p>"I’ll miss the competitiveness too. But it’s time to try something different.”</p>
      <p>Ardrossan begin life without Cashy at Greenock tomorrow afternoon.</p>
      <p>But it’s Junior Cup Fourth Round for those lucky enough to be left in the competition and top ties this afternoon include Irvine Meadow v Glenafton, Pollok v Troon, Petershill v Glencairn and Dundee North End v Rob Roy.</p>
      <p>In the West Premiership Kilbirnie host Kilwinning and Clydebank head to Cumnock.</p>
