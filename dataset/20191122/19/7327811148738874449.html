      <p>CEDARHURST, Nassau County (WABC) -- Several small business owners are trying to figure out what's next after fire heavily damaged a row of stores on Long Island early Friday.</p>
      <p>The fire started burned through the stores comprising the Cedarhurst Shoppes on Central Avenue in Cedarhurst just before 3 a.m.</p>
      <p>Lawrence Cedarhurst Fire Department Chief Edward Koehler said firefighters received a call from police at 2:49 a.m. reporting smoke coming from the building.</p>
      <p>"We arrived in a couple minutes, found heavy fire conditions in the basement," Koehler said. "The building is an old building, believe it or not, and has a common basement with numerous partitions, storage. So (firefighters) met a lot of resistance at the very beginning."</p>

      <p>Firefighters broke windows as smoke billowed from the row of stores. The fire, which eventually went to four alarms, broke out in the basement and spread to all the stores.</p>
      <p>A restaurant, a pizzeria, an ice cream shop, a cleaners and a pharmacy - all locally owned - were heavily damaged.</p>
      <p>"It's terrible, a lot of people losing a lot of business," said Moshe Lazar, of Brick Oven Pizza. "It's devastating to a lot of people. I mean, this is their livelihood: the burger place, the pizza store, the pharmacy. These are all people who make their living day to day."</p>
      <p>Fortunately, no injuries were reported.</p>
      <p>Koehler said the structure itself is safe, but for now the building is uninhabitable because firefighters had to cut a hole in the floor to get to the flames.</p>
      <p>The fire marshal is now working to determine how the fire started.</p>
