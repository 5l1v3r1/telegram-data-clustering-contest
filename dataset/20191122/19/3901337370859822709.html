      <h1>Lakay: Obviously We Want Chiefs, But…</h1>

      <p>According to Lyle Lakay, the Mamelodi Sundowns players have been criticised for getting ahead of themselves when it comes to the Telkom Knockout final.</p>
      <p>Football fans have argued – and quite rightly so, that the Brazilians must first overcome the hurdle that is Golden Arrows in the semi-finals at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium tomorrow afternoon to set up another meet with Kaizer Chiefs, who must also beat Maritzburg United a day later at the Mbombela Stadium.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Downs players are hurting after two back-to-back defeats to Amakhosi, first in a mid-season friendly and then again in the Absa Premiership recently.</p>
      <p>“I did an interview last week and I was asked about Chiefs, and people were asking why Sundowns players are focusing on Chiefs so much,” said Lakay.</p>
      <p>“But the reality is that it’s the journalists who are asking about Chiefs and I had to answer. If I had to pick a team to face in the final, I would say Maritzburg. Obviously we want Chiefs, but whoever we get, we are in the competition to win it.”</p>
      <p>A Chiefs and Sundowns fixture would be a replay of the 2015 Telkom Knockout cup final the Brazilians won 3-1 in Durban. It was a sponsors dream, which Lakay understands.</p>
      <p>But he is cautious.</p>
      <p>“I won’t say we want revenge, but we would want to win against Arrows and get Chiefs in the final. But it doesn’t matter if it’s them or Maritzburg – if we go to the final. People are going to talk about us getting Chiefs because of what has happened and that will be exciting because of the rivalry. But all we want is to do is go to the final,” said Lakay.    </p>
