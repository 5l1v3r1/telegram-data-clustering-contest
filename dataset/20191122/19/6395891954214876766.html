      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - Rhode Island is behind schedule when it comes to putting up gantries on state highways for the state's truck tolling system.</p>
      <p>WPRI-TV reports that the state Department of Transportation has missed multiple self-imposed deadlines to get more gantries up and running, raising doubts about whether the program will bring in the $25 million projected in this year's budget.</p>
      <p>The department had hoped to have seven of the 13 gantry locations up and running by this week, but only four are in operation. A fifth on Interstate 295 in Cumberland is about three months behind schedule.</p>
      <p>An agency spokeswoman says the delays were caused by severe flooding in the Midwest where a steel fabricator is located.</p>
      <p>The four tolling locations now operating collected $2.8 million between July 1 and Oct. 31.</p>
