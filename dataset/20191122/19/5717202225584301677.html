      <p>Former Tottenham Hotspur manager Andre Villas-Boas has given his opinion about Jose Mourinho becoming the new Spurs boss.</p>

      <p>Arguably, it’s been the biggest story of the season so far and many fans and pundits have had an opinion about the decision.</p>
      <p>One man who is well placed to give his take is Villas-Boas who, like Mourinho, had managed Chelsea before rocking up at Spurs.</p>
      <p>The current Marseille manager believes there could well be fireworks between The Special One and Levy.</p>

      <p>He said <a href="https://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/football/tottenham-villas-boas-y-croit-pour-mourinho-mais-tacle-le-president-1811219.html">in an interview with RMC Sport</a>: “I am very happy for Jose.</p>
      <p>“He’s coming back to a club that I know well, the owner too, it’s an unusual marriage, I know both of them.</p>
      <p>“These are two characters, I do not think not that it will work very well (laughs) but they have reached an agreement so good…”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – The big concern</h3>
      <p>Spurs fans who did not want Mourinho voiced their concerns about how he would work together with Levy, who is known for his stubborn ways and tight pursestrings when it comes to transfers.</p>

      <p>AVB’s comments may not make those fans feel much better, but perhaps the chairman’s ways will change with one of the biggest spending managers in the history of football Mourinho now at the helm.</p>
      <p>There could well be clashes, but maybe the relationship just might surprise a few people.</p>
