      <p>Stories of bravery, determination, and courage, as well as of kind heartedness and generosity were heard at the 2019 Meath Garda Youth Awards at the Headfort Arms Hotel, Kells.  The Youth Awards, sponsored by Centra, celebrate outstanding young people living in Meath between the ages of 13 and 21 years.</p>
      <p>An Garda Siochana and Centra recognise that a considerable amount of positive work is being done by young people throughout communities across Meath.  These young people who make a positive contribution to their community, helping to make it a better place to live. The award categories include a Special Achievement award for a young person who has overcome difficult circumstance and whose bravery sets them apart.  The Adult/Mentor award recognises that many young people get invaluable help along the way from an adult, be it in their capacity as mentors, coaches, or group leaders. This vital and often unheralded work helps to develop a sense of self-worth in young people.<br/>The first National Garda Youth Awards Scheme was held earlier this year and one winner in four of the categories will go forward to represent Meath at the National Garda Youth Awards.  There is also a new category this year for Community Safety which is for young people who through a crime prevention or safety initiative have made their community a safer place to live.</p>
