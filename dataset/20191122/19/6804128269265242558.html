      <h2>The latest in our end of decade series on football.london looks back at the night it all fell apart for Spurs in the Battle of the Bridge with Chelsea</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Warlow</a></address>
      <p>It was a night that Tottenham fans will want to forget, but one that any Leicester City supporter will always remember as Eden Hazard handed the Foxes the Premier League title after an epic battle at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Spurs</a> visited west London knowing that they had to win to keep their Premier League title hopes alive in what had become an unlikely two-horse race between Mauricio Pochettino's men and Claudio Ranieri's unlikely lads from Leicester City.</p>
      <p>But while Leicester's players were all at Jamie Vardy's house awaiting a possible party, Tottenham had to battle it out with different rivals wearing blue on a Monday night in early May, with Chelsea standing in their way in SW6.</p>
      <p>We look back on the game below as part of our end of decade series on <b>football.london</b>.</p>
      <p>As the Mirror's chief football writer John Cross wrote in his report of the game, the belting out of Blue is the Colour at Stamford Bridge at the final whistle was entirely appropriate, with the celebrations beginning in the east Midlands after Eden Hazard's superb strike left Spurs' title hopes in tatters.</p>

      <p>As Cross noted: "It was the blue of Leicester rather than that of Chelsea celebrating the title this time in the greatest upset the Premier League has ever seen.</p>
      <p>But, he continued: "No club will be toasting City's success as much as Chelsea, because they killed off Tottenham's hope of winning the title."</p>
      <p>It was a bruising battle between the two rivals in a heated London derby, with both sides facing FA charges in the wake of a game that descended into chaos, with players from both sides clashing in the tunnel amid a mass brawl, while Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink was knocked over in the melee.</p>

      <p>In total, 12 yellow cards were shown on a night when tempers rose to boiling point, with the brawl at the final whistle appearing to have been sparked by former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas taunting distraught Spurs players, as reported by the Mirror's Darren Lewis in the aftermath of the bitter contest.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the game, in which a record nine Spurs players were booked, Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino said: "Emotion is normal in a game like this.</p>
      <p>"Fighting on the pitch, however, is not a good example for either team."</p>

      <p>As Cross reported, the brutal tone for the game was set in the seventh minute in a flare-up between John Obi Mikel and Mousa Dembele, which was let go by referee Mark Clattenburg on a night that eventually got out of control.</p>
      <p>But it had all started so well in terms of the score for Pochettino's men on a night when they simply had to win to keep the title race alive.</p>
      <p>Harry Kane gave Spurs a 35th minute lead after he rounded Asmir Begovic for his 14th goal in 15 games, before Son Heung-min doubled the visitors' advantage just before the break with a low shot.</p>

      <p>This gave Spurs fans hope of a first win at Chelsea for 26 years, and better still, looked to have kept their title dreams alive.</p>
      <p>But that all changed in the second half as players lost their heads and Chelsea staged a dramatic fightback.</p>
      <p>The Blues had not had much to cheer amid a miserable season that had started with Jose Mourinho in charge, before Guus Hiddink took over on an interim basis.</p>
      <p>However, the Stamford Bridge faithful were delighted with the fight shown by their side in the second half, quite literally at times.</p>
      <p>Eden Hazard proved to be a catalyst for the sea change in the outcome, with the Belgian introduced at half time.</p>
      <p>Gary Cahill got the first goal to halve the deficit as Spurs failed to deal with a Willian corner, before Hazard himself stepped up to strike the decisive blow, exchanging passes with Diego Costa before curling into the top corner past Hugo Lloris.</p>

      <p>It was a goal worthy of winning any game, but in this case it was one that won a title for another team.</p>
      <p>The sad thing was it also contributed to some of the ugliest scenes that have been seen in the Premier League in recent years at the full time whistle as players clashed with emotions running high.</p>

      <p>For Chelsea, it was to be a highlight in a largely forgettable season, while for Spurs, it was undoubtedly the low point of a season that had promised so much, only to end in disappointment.</p>
      <p>That Spurs ended up finishing third behind north London rivals was a real bitter pill to swallow for the Lilywhites supporters, who were once again subjected to taunts from their rivals as the Gunners got to celebrate St Totteringham's Day once more.</p>
