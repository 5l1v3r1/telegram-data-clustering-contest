      <h1>Watch These Movies Before ’21 Bridges’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:30:54+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/jminor/" target="_blank">Jordan Minor</a></address>
      <p><i>21 Bridges</i> was originally scheduled to come to theaters a few months ago. But maybe the Russo Brothers, who produced this movie, didn’t want it to conflict with that other little movie they made with Chadwick Boseman. Or maybe they figured a gritty cop action movie would be good counter-programming for <i>Frozen 2</i>. That’s a pretty funny Endgame.</p>

      <h3>The Dark Knight Rises</h3>
      <p>The bridges in <i>21 Bridges</i> refers to all the ways to get in and out of Manhattan. As part of a city-wide manhunt, all of the bridges are closed and the island is contained. Since Chadwick Boseman and the Russos naturally make us think of superheroes, this premises reminds us of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Knight-Rises-Christian-Bale/dp/B009LREA1S/"><i>The Dark Knight Rises</i></a> where Gotham is similarly isolated because of Bane’s terrorism.</p>

      <h3>Die Hard</h3>
      <p>I would rather be stuck in a whole bustling city rather than a single building, but still any cop action movie that traps the characters in a confined location owes a debt to <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Die-Hard-Bruce-Willis/dp/B009EEQO08/">Die Hard</a>.</i></p>

      <h3>Message from the King</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80155475"><i>Message from the King</i></a> is a movie where Chadwick Boseman plays a proud African defending his family’s honor through conflict that isn’t <i>Black Panther</i>. King is just his last name, not a title. That definitely did this on purpose, right?</p>
