      <p>White Rock RCMP, with support of the City of White Rock, has launched an initiative aimed at increasing safety for the LGBTQ2S+ community.</p>
      <p>According to a news release, the ‘Safe Place’ program offers individuals “shelter if they are feeling unsafe, and a place where they will be welcomed and can call police and wait until officers arrive.”</p>
      <p>“Businesses, schools, or other institutions may apply to join the program. By placing a decal in their window, they will be clearly identifying the premise as a safe haven and ally for members of the LGBTQ2S+ community,” the release states.</p>
      <p>White Rock Mayor Darryl Walker said the detachment “reflects our community values.”</p>
      <p>“The Safe Place program gives individuals from the LGBTQ2S+ community shelter when they need it most. Thank you to White Rock RCMP for this initiative,” Walker said in the release.</p>
