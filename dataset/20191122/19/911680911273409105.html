      <p>SEDONA, AZ — A man was arrested for making bomb threats at a Chase Bank, in the Village of Oak Creek, Sedona, Arizona.</p>
      <p>Deputies responded to a call at 12:20 p.m. on November 21, at Chase Bank located at 6666 State Route 179 concerning a man yelling he had a bomb.</p>
      <p>The Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office reported that Michael Chase, 48, walked into the bank demanding that his account be closed and threatened that he had a bomb in his vehicle parked outside.</p>
      <p>Deputies say that bank employees set off an alarm and people were evacuated from the building. Within minutes, deputies arrived and informed nearby businesses to evacuate.</p>
      <p>When law enforcement entered the building, Chase had already reportedly broken a bank window with an unknown object. They then used pepper spray which had little effect on the suspect.</p>
      <p>Deputies were eventually able to handcuff the suspect after using a taser gun.</p>
      <p>A bomb squad assessed the scene and no bombs were found.</p>
      <p>Chase was charged with misconduct regarding a simulated explosive device, terrorist threats, and false reporting and vandalism.</p>
