      <p>An Edmonton youth has been arrested and faces 17 charges from Wetaskiwin RCMP ranging from theft, possession of stolen property and weapons offenses.</p>
      <p>According to Wetaskiwin RCMP spokesperson Cst. Shaun Marchand, “On November 21st, 2019 at least two suspects entered the garage of a residence in Edmonton and stole two vehicles from the home. A short time later one of the vehicles was located in Wetaskiwin by the Wetaskiwin RCMP.</p>
      <p>“An attempt was made to stop the vehicle where it then struck a police vehicle. The vehicle fled from police but quickly entered a drainage ditch and suffered significant damage.</p>
      <p>“A 16-year-old youth was arrested a short distance away. With the assistance of the Wetaskiwin Crime Reduction Unit and the Edmonton Police Service the investigation determined that the 16-year-old was one of the individuals who committed the break and enter. The youth also entered another vehicle in Edmonton where he stole a credit card which was later used in Wetaskiwin.</p>
      <p>“The youth that was arrested was found to be a prolific offender in the Edmonton area and had been responsible for two other motor vehicle thefts in November alone for which he had already been charged.</p>
      <p>“As a result of the investigation, a 16-year-old youth of Edmonton, Alberta has been charged with:</p>
      <p>· Breaking and entering and committing theft</p>
      <p>· Theft of a sport utility vehicle</p>
      <p>· Operation while prohibited</p>
      <p>· Possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose</p>
      <p>· Failure to stop after accident</p>
      <p>· Possession of property obtained by crime over $5,000</p>
      <p>· Flight from a peace officer</p>
      <p>· Dangerous operation of a motor vehicle</p>
      <p>· Failure to comply with undertaking/recognizance x5</p>
      <p>· Unauthorised use of a credit card</p>
      <p>· Theft of a credit card</p>
      <p>· Drive uninsured motor vehicle</p>
      <p>· Fail to obey traffic control device</p>
      <p>“The youth was brought before a Justice of a Peace and is being held in custody until court on November 22, 2019.</p>
