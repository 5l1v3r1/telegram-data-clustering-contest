      <h1>Man United and Tottenham among clubs to have ‘made enquiries’ for young midfielder – Cheap release clause</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:06:21+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/tom-coast/" target="_blank">Tom Coast</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United and Lorenzo Pellegrini is a love story that has gone on for quite some time, and one that remains very one sided for now.</p>
      <p>Dating back to the early days of the José Mourinho tenure, the interest out of Old Trafford has never really faded, although it has been a bit less prominent of late.</p>
      <p>Tottenham were also suitors this summer,<a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/confirmation-tottenham-interest-22-year-old-spurs-met-youngsters-agent/"> with Il Tempo going as far as saying Spurs ‘met with the youngster’s agent’</a>, but nothing ever happened as the player seemingly decided he wanted to stay in Rome.</p>
      <p>In an article on Friday, <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/inter-non-tramonta-l-idea-pellegrini-71676">Calciomercato</a> claim both Manchester United and the London club have continued their pursuit of the player as they are two of four clubs (Milan and Juventus the others) who have ‘made enquiries over the months’.</p>
      <p>This comes after Inter and Antonio Conte have come knocking once again too, and with a release clause of €30m in his contract, it’s no wonder teams are circling.</p>
      <p>At the end of the day, the midfielder has the last word, and no matter what his clause is, he can turn down offers made to him.</p>
      <p>That appears to be what he has been doing all this time.</p>
