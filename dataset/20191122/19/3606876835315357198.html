        <b>If you've watched the movie The Game Changers, you're also likely aware of <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a29067926/the-game-changers-movie-fact-check/">the controversy surrounding the film </a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The continued debate has encircled doctors, dietitians, bodybuilders, <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a29613285/the-mountain-vegan-diet/">The Mountain himself </a>, and, now, Joe Rogan.</p>
      <p>The Game Changers, at its core, argues that eating animal productseven in small amountscan mess with your heart, sexual function, athletic performance, and eventually lead to an early death.</p>
      <p>And that sexual function part proves especially sticky for Rogan.</p>
      <p><a href="https://chriskresser.com/about/">Chris Kresser </a>recently appeared on the <a href="http://podcasts.joerogan.net/">Joe Rogan Experience podcast </a>, and the duo talked about the movie at length, with a specific focus on the experiment within the movie that focused on the role meat plays in sexual function.</p>
      <p>In The Game Changers, urologist Aaron Spitz, M.D., conducts an experiment measuring three sexual health of three athletes. The test includes assessing the strength of nocturnal erections, once after eating a steak burrito, and once after eating a burrito with plant-based protein. The test results came out in favor of plant-based eating.</p>
      <p>"So what can we conclude from this experiment? Absolutely nothing," Kresser explains. "It was not peer-reviewed, it was not scientific at all."</p>
      <p>In defense of The Game Changers, Spitz himself clarifies in the movie that the experiment is not a study. And Kresser is not a medical expert. He's the author of publications promoting a Paleo (read: meat-heavy) diet.</p>
      <p>But the questions Kresser and Rogan raiseparticularly if the athletes tested in the experiment had sex or masturbated before or after eating the burritoare pertinent to the debate.</p>
      <p>Men's Health previously <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a29067926/the-game-changers-movie-fact-check/">fact-checked The </a><a href="https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a29067926/the-game-changers-movie-fact-check/"> Game Changers </a>, and pointed out that the erection experiment also didn't consider, "variables like sleep, muscle fatigue, stress, training, hydration, history of tobacco use, weekly alcohol consumption, prior medical history, mental clarity, emotional state, andHERES A BIG ONEgenetic predispositions."</p>
