      <h1>Samsung Galaxy S11 renders show off a phone that looks similar to the Note 10</h1>
      <h2>Information about Samsung's upcoming flagship smartphone line is starting to leak</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T19:37:55+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 19:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/dean-daley" target="_blank">Dean Daley</a></address>
      <p>The<a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/12/samsung-galaxy-s11-hole-punch-display/"> Samsung Galaxy S11 series</a> is expected to release in three sizes.</p>
      <p>The leak, which comes from<a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s11-render-design-exclusive"> @OnLeaks and 91Mobiles</a>, shows that the phone will feature a centred Infinity-O display with screen sizes between 6.3 and 6.7-inches, along with curves on the sides. This makes the device look sort of like a <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/08/23/samsung-galaxy-note-10-review/">Note 10</a> with more curved angles.</p>

      <p>The volume keys and power buttons are on the right side, while the left edge of the phone has no keys at all. There is also a USB-C port flanked by speakers on the bottom.</p>
      <p>The rear of the phone features as many as five sensors — three are cameras, one is likely a time of flight sensor, but what the last sensor does remains unclear. While the primary camera reportedly sports a 108-megapixel sensor, there’s also rumoured to be a 5x optical zoom lens featured in the phone as well.</p>
      <p>In Canada, all three models will reportedly sport a Snapdragon 865 processor. Other rumoured S11 features include Android 10-based One UI 2.0 and a display that features a 120Hz refresh rate. Finally, the S11e and the S11 will reportedly come in both 4G and 5G variants, while the S11+ will only launch in a 5G version.</p>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy S11 series will likely be released in February of 2020.</p>
