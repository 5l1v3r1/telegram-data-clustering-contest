      <p>What a way to celebrate Diabetes Awareness Month.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/airlines">Westjet</a> passenger’s flight quickly went south after flight attendants served him two different potato preparations after he requested a “diabetic-friendly meal.” He recounted his flightmare on social media, where it quickly went viral.</p>

      <p>British music producer James Boyle, better known as DJ Breakage, says he’d asked for a “diabetic-friendly” meal on a Westjet flight from Canada to the UK, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/westjet-diabetic-passengers-potatoes-inflight-meal-carbohydrates-sugar-a9212011.html">the Independent reported</a>. What he got instead was a very non-diabetic-friendly helping of both boiled and mashed potatoes.</p>
      <p>Suffice it to say, Boyle was not happy with the carbohydrate “speedball.” He <a href="https://twitter.com/Breakage/status/1196525546227879938">tweeted at</a> the Canada-based airline Monday, saying “Dear WestJet, I’m not one for being a diva, but when I have a diabetic meal request, the last thing I expect is this.”</p>

      <p>He added that the meals were “solely based on carbohydrates and sugar, which are the two most dangerous foods to a diabetic.”</p>
      <p>Specifically, they can cause “coma, amputation, blindness and even death,” according to a subsequent tweet by Boyle, who revealed that he was a Type 1 diabetic, reports the Independent. Although, <a href="https://twitter.com/Breakage/status/1196526039561883649">he added</a>, “even not being diabetic, how is that a meal?”</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the diabetic DJ’s complaints appear to have fallen on deaf ears.</p>

      <p>Adding insult to potential diabetic coma, <a href="https://twitter.com/WestJet/status/1196526700772888577">Westjet tweeted</a> that they’d yet “to see the food served on board be a real point of concern for our guests, who are traveling for reasons beyond that.”</p>

      <p>The seemingly flippant response didn’t sit well with the social media masses.</p>
      <p>“This is one of the rudest customer responses I’ve seen ever!” <a href="https://twitter.com/CHIMPOMCR/status/1196571986299957249">exclaimed one</a> sympathizer. Another <a href="https://twitter.com/LogisticsDNB/status/1196588576047325184">chimed in</a>, “so many people have allergies and specific dietary requirements these days. How are you so oblivious to this?”</p>
      <p>Westjet has since been shamed into a 180 on their previous responses. “We missed the mark earlier and we’d love the opportunity to look into this further,” <a href="https://twitter.com/WestJet/status/1196824024199946240">tweeted the airline</a>.</p>
      <p>An <a href="https://twitter.com/Breakage/status/1196841242572795904">unimpressed Boyle replied</a>, “No. But how about an actual apology? Accept responsibility for your dangerous &amp; thoughtless actions, learn from them and change accordingly.”</p>
