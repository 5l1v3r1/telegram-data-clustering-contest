      <h1>‘Disgraceful’: Funeral giant InvoCare accused of ‘profiteering’ from grieving families</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:35:22+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/newdaily/" target="_blank">The New Daily</a></address>
      <p>An investigation by a leading consumer advocacy group has found funeral giant InvoCare, which includes brands such as White Lady Funerals and Simplicity Funerals, has allegedly been profiteering with misleading invoices and hidden fees.</p>
      <p>The listed company has been challenged over its practice of adding an “unnecessary” late fee of $352 by default to its bills.</p>
      <p>“This practice is absolutely disgraceful,” CHOICE Director of Campaigns Erin Turner said in a statement on Friday.</p>
      <p>Following a tip-off from an industry insider, CHOICE conducted an investigation into the billing practices of the funeral giant.</p>
      <p>It found the invoices allegedly showed InvoCare funeral homes incorporating the late fee into the total figure of all invoices. And if families pay before or on the due date, the fee is supposed to be deducted.</p>
      <p>Speaking on condition of anonymity, the industry insider told CHOICE: “It is a straight out revenue grab from unsuspecting, vulnerable customers … it is a complete gouge of customers.”</p>
      <p>“These fees are incredibly misleading and are akin to fees for no service and pay-on-time discounts,” Ms Turner said.</p>
      <p>CHOICE said its investigators also found the charge appeared on bills as an “administration fee” when it’s clearly not.</p>
      <p>Ms Turner accused InvoCare of “profiteering from grieving families” and called on the company to scrap the practice.</p>
      <p>CHOICE has now lodged a complaint with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</p>
      <p>“InvoCare must scrap this disgraceful practice and be fair to grieving families. CHOICE has made a complaint to the ACCC, but InvoCare shouldn’t wait, they have an ethical duty to stop this disgraceful practice now,” Ms Turner said.</p>
      <p><i>The New Daily</i> has contacted InvoCare for comment.</p>
      <p>InvoCare, which also operates a pet cremation business, posted a net profit of more than $40 million for the half-year ended June 30.</p>
