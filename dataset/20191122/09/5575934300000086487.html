        <li>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-truck-pictures-info-details-price-2019-11">reveal of Tesla’s new Cybertruck</a> hit a snag Thursday when its “armour glass” windows got smashed during a demonstration.</li>
        <li>CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/tesla-pickup-truck-cybertruck-reveal-how-to-watch-details-2019-11">unveiled the $US39,900 truck</a> in Los Angeles and got Tesla’s lead designer, Franz von Holzhausen, to test the windows with a metal ball.</li>
        <li>Von Holzhausen threw the ball and smashed both the front and read side windows with ease. Musk reacted: “Oh my f—ing God. Well, maybe that was a little too hard.”</li>

      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-truck-pictures-info-details-price-2019-11">Tesla’s new Cybertruck reveal</a> didn’t go quite as smoothly as expected after its “armour glass” windows got smashed during a live test.</p>
      <p>CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-truck-pictures-info-details-price-2019-11">unveiled the $US39,900 truck in Los Angeles on Thursday</a>, and he got Tesla’s lead designer, Franz von Holzhausen, to test the left-side windows by throwing a silver metal ball at them.</p>
      <p>After von Holzhausen smashed the front-left window with ease, Musk exclaimed: “Oh my f—ng God. Well, maybe that was a little too hard.”</p>

      <p>“It didn’t go through – that’s a plus side,” he said.</p>
      <p>Von Halzhausen then tested the back-left window, which also smashed. “Room for improvement,” Musk joked.</p>
      <p>“We threw wrenches, we threw literally the kitchen sink at the glass and it didn’t break. For some reason it broke now … I don’t know why.”</p>

      <p>Before the hiccup, in his opening remarks, Musk said trucks had “been the same for a very long time,” while images of conventional trucks flashed on a screen behind him.</p>
      <p>A caption on the screen said “100 years of the same.”</p>

      <p>The Cybertruck is made of a heavy-duty exterior shell made from “ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled stainless steel” and armoured glass, according to Tesla.</p>
      <p>Musk took pains to show the Cybertruck as being <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/tesla-pickup-truck-cybertruck-reveal-how-to-watch-details-2019-11">unlike any other production passenger truck on the road</a>, punctuated by a 100-cubic-foot cargo area and up to 14,000 pounds of towing capacity.</p>
      <p>The premier Cybertruck variant can reach 60 mph in 2.9 seconds, according to Tesla.</p>
