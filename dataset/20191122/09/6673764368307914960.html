      <p><b>KOBE – </b>A labor standards office has concluded that the suicide in 2017 of an employee at a unit of Mitsubishi Electric Corp. was work-related, recognizing that he did more than 100 hours of overtime per month while in a supervisory position, company officials said Friday.</p>
      <p>The Oct. 4 certification regarding the death of the engineer, who was in his 40s, at Melco Semiconductor Engineering Corp. in Fukuoka Prefecture came as labor authorities step up monitoring, after finding that a slew of firms have promoted workers to supervisory positions in order to make them work longer hours.</p>
      <p>Japanese labor law limits the working hours of regular employees, but the restrictions do not apply to workers in supervisory positions.</p>
      <p>The worker was on loan to another Mitsubishi Electric unit from April 2013, and his mental health was affected after he was assigned a heavy workload at a plant in Toyooka in Hyogo Prefecture.</p>
      <p>He killed himself in December 2017 after being transferred to work in Fukuoka Prefecture, and his family filed to have his death certified as work-related in July of last year.</p>
      <p>In his role in Fukuoka he was subject to the discretionary labor system, which rewards workers based on predetermined number of overtime hours instead of the actual hours worked.</p>
      <p>“We take seriously the fact that a worker at a related company has died,” Mitsubishi Electric said in a statement. “We will work on thoroughly implementing appropriate labor control.”</p>
      <p>The labor authorities awarded workers’ compensation to five employees at Mitsubishi Electric between 2014 and 2017, two of whom had killed themselves.</p>
