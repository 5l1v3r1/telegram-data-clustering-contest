      <p>Since releasing its first film in 2008, Marvel Studios has established a reputation as one of Hollywood's more secretive studios. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, writers who have been making contributions to the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/marvel-cinematic-universe/">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> since their work on <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i>, recently revealed some behind the scenes details on the studios' unique production process.</p>
      <p>While discussing <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> with <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/avengers-endgame-writers-alternate-storylines">Vanity Fair</a>, McFeely spilled on how the film's creative team chose and kept track of each character, "On one wall is Movie One, and one wall is Movie Two, and the third wall has baseball cards of all the Marvel characters, and we could move them around… They’re all in my dresser. I think I’ll hold on to them for a while."</p>

      <p>McFeely went on to disclose the creation of the cards stating, "Marvel makes them. Yeah. Some intern in-house makes them. They have a magnet on the back. They get dog-eared and bent and stuff. [Each one] says if we have them or not for this movie. And there was a little rating. We didn’t know how much [money] each actor made, but it had either one dollar sign or up to five dollar signs."</p>
      <p>Directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> stars Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Brie Larson as Captain Marvel, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, Don Cheadle as War Machine, Karen Gillan as Nebula, Danai Gurira as Okoye and Bradley Cooper as Rocket, with Gwyneth Paltrow Pepper Potts, Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan, Benedict Wong as Wong, Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie and Josh Brolin as Thanos.
