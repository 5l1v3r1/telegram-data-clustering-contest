      <p>Bear Grylls unveiled an interesting new look on Good Morning Britain – the adventurer is rocking a serious moustache while doing his bit for Movember.</p>
      <p>Viewers couldn’t deal with the ‘70s porn star’ ‘tache, which the survival expert has been growing for the whole of November in honour of Men’s Health Awareness Week.</p>
      <p>The money raised by Movember goes to help tackle prostate cancer, testicular cancer, mental health and suicide prevention – so it’s worth Bear looking a bit silly for a few weeks.</p>

      <p>Fans posted about his new look on Twitter, writing: ‘So Bear Grylls has a got a 70s pornstar moustache to go with his 70s pornstar name’.</p>
      <p>Others added: ‘Why does @BearGrylls look like your standard movie villain with that moustache?!’ and ‘Bear Grylls with a Zoro tash?’</p>
      <p>Viewers were glad there was a reason behind his new face fuzz, commenting: ‘I hope that Tash is for #Movember and not for real’ and ‘WTF is that on Bear Grylls face?’</p>

      <p>He revealed how the ‘tache came about to Ben Shephard and Charlotte Hawkins: ‘[I shaved the beard off] and left the moustache, then I went home and my wife went “urgh, ooh”.</p>
      <p>‘I start our new Netflix series next week so I’m going to get rid of it for that but I thought, it’s Movember and why not?’</p>

      <p>Bear will be filming for a new interactive Netflix survival show You vs Wild, in a similar style to Black Mirror’s Bandersnatch.</p>
      <p>He said on Twitter: ‘This is going to be a journey unlike any I’ve EVER embarked on before. I need YOU to think ahead, choose wisely, and most importantly, never give up.’</p>
