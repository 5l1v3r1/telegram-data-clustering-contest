      <p>As <i>Absolute Carnage</i> hurtles towards its conclusion, the symbiote villain's crimson tendrils keep spreading from one hero's story to another's. Most recently, the threat of the now god-like Carnage came to the doorstep of Carol "Captain Marvel" Danvers and claimed a crucial member of her supporting cast: <a href="https://www.cbr.com/captain-marvel-cat-carnage/">her cat Chewie</a>.</p>
      <p>While Chewie has been increasingly bigger part of Captain Marvel's world since the hero's Marvel Cinematic Universe debut last year, Carol's "cat" is not actually a cat. Much like the MCU's Goose, Chewie is really an alien with fangs and tentacles nested within one another that sprout out of her mouth like a Cthulu monstrosity. At the very center of the alien is her very own pocket dimension, which means there's seldom any returning from the fang-filled mouths once they gobble you up.</p>

      <p>While Carol thought Chewie was just a normal cat at first, she eventually discovered that sheis actually an alien called a Flerken, a rare species that's feared throughout the galaxy. She may be a cute put that Carol tenderly takes care of, but she knows just how deadly he can be if one of her nine lives is threatened.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Carol has to deal with a symbiote-infected Chewie in <i>Absolute Carnage: Captain Marvel</i> #1. In his quest to collect the genetic codices imprinted in the spines of all former symbiote hosts, Carnage spied on Carol and those around her for weeks before making his move. Carol previously became a host for the Venom symbiote in <i>Siege: Spider-Man</i>, which put her squarely in Carnage's sights. Knowing that Carol was too powerful to go for directly, and that she has displayed immunity to symbiotes in the past, Carnage instead targeted Chewie.</p>

      <p>Surprised to find her house cat turned into a deadly monster upon her arrival home, Carol immediately entered combat with one of the most fearsome species in the galaxy now inhabited by <i>another</i> deadly alien. What's worse, Carnage played up on Carol's concern for her cat throughout the fight, knowing that if she did not pull her punches she would injure one of her dearest companions.</p>
      <p>After she was and plunged into Chewie's stomach pocket-dimension , Captain Marvel wrestled with the symbiote before releasing an outburst of power. She managed to escape, separate the symbiote from her cat, and fly off into space.</p>
      <p>When the symbiote tried to take over Captain Marvel, she let out a burst of Binary energy that tore it apart in Earth's upper atmosphere. After that, Carol promptly jumped back into the fray against the symbiotes on Earth. However, she made sure that Chewie sat out the rest of this adventure and left her in the care of Spider-Woman.</p>
