      <p>FOLLOWING a nationwide search, Ireland’s most Inspirational people were announced at the inaugural Gala Retail/Sunday Independent Inspiration Awards, which took place in The Marker Hotel, Dublin.</p>
      <p>Fifteen-year-old Sophia Shally from Westport scooped one of the top awards and was named as Ireland’s Inspirational Young Person.</p>
      <p>Nominated by her mum, Sophia was presented with the Inspirational Young Person accolade in recognition of the strength and positivity she has, and continues to, display.</p>
      <p>At just seven months, a devastating fire left her with life-changing burns across her face, hands and scalp. In spite of the painful treatment, which is ongoing, onerous travel and long periods of time away from her friends and family, Sophia finds the strength to stay positive.</p>
      <p>A gifted musician, Sophia uses her talents to give back to the community and recently created a CD with her mother which helped raise €10,000 for the Kevin Bell Repatriation trust.</p>
      <p>Sophia has experienced so much suffering and pain but continues to love her life and inspire everyone around her.</p>
      <p>Inspirational people from all across Ireland were nominated for the first-ever Sunday Independent/Gala Retail Inspiration Awards, with the final winners being selected by a judging panel including Sunday Independent Life magazine wellness columnist Alison Canavan; RTÉ’s Marty Morrissey; Special Olympics Ireland’s CEO Matt English; Gala Retail’s CEO Gary Desmond and Head of News at the Sunday Independent, Paul Sheridan.</p>
      <p>“Sophia and the fellow winners are true examples of people who are making Ireland a better place for us all. My fellow judges and I were incredibly impressed by the strength and positivity displayed by Sophia despite all the pain and treatments she has gone through and continues to go through. Sophia is a worthy winner and our Inspirational Young Person,” commented Gary Desmond, CEO of Gala Retail.</p>
