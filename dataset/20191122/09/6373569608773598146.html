      <h1>Niall Canavan: Plymouth Argyle starting to repay Green Army after Devon Derby drubbing</h1>
      <h2>The Pilgrims have bounced back from a 4-0 defeat at Exeter with back-to-back 1-0 away wins</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:42:27+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:42</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Defender Niall Canavan believes Plymouth Argyle have begun to repay the Green Army after the 4-0 Devon Derby drubbing by Exeter City last month.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">The Pilgrims</a> have bounced back from the debacle at St James Parek with back-to-back 1-0 away wins.</p>
      <p>First, they defeated Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup first round, and then Argyle went to League Two leaders Forest Green Rovers and also beat them.</p>
      <p>Next up for the Pilgrims is the visit of third-placed Bradford City to Home Park on Saturday.</p>
      <p>That will be another test of the Pilgrims’ credentials to make a serious promotion push over the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>The mood around Home Park has improved considerably since losing so emphatically to Exeter.</p>
      <p>Canavan said: “We were all hurting after the game. We knew we were going to get booed by the fans.</p>
      <p>“You are well aware of what has happened and what is going to come.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to go and try to applaud them because you know really that they don’t want you to do it.</p>
      <p>“But we are thankful for the support we have had everywhere.</p>
      <p>“We have said from there we need to repay them and the two good defensive displays away from home are hopefully the start of doing that.”</p>
      <p>Argyle have had their issues defensively this season, particularly when defending set pieces in their own penalty area.</p>

      <p>However, they have kept three clean sheets in their last four league games with Exeter the notable exception.</p>
      <p>Canavan said: “It’s hard work on the training ground and pointing out a few principles that we maybe let slip at certain times in games.</p>
      <p>“Or there is games that we have maybe lost control of when we have not been at our best.</p>
      <p>“We have got a good record for clean sheets this season and in some games there has been a glut of goals at times that have hurt us, and that’s something we have got to address.</p>
      <p>“We have worked on things on the training ground, we have had meetings and we all understand our roles and what’s expected of us.</p>
      <p>“The last two results in particular away from home we have really dug in and got the gritty bit done.”</p>
      <p>Manager Ryan Lowe has settled on a defensive trio in ther last couple of matches which has seen Canavan in the centre of defence, with Scott Wootton and Gary Sawyer either side of him.</p>
      <p>Canavan said: “Obviously, we know each other from last season but didn’t play as a three.</p>
      <p>“It is something that the more work you do the more you build on those relationships and you get familiar with what people tend to do in certain situations.</p>
      <p>“You get to pick up on little bits and we spend a lot of time here (at Home Park) together. That will just continue to build the more we play together.”</p>
      <p>The visit of Bradford to Home Park will see Leeds-born Canavan line up against the club which released him at the age of 12.</p>
      <p>Canavan said: “It’s a club I spent a bit of time at and knew some good people there.</p>
      <p>“They are a big team up there. They are well supported and I’m sure they will be coming down in good numbers so it should make it a good game.”</p>
      <p>After being released by Bradford, Canavan played for local ataeur side Leeds City before being spotted by Scunthorpe United and signed up.</p>

      <p>Canavan said: “I was only 12 so nobody (at Bradford) knows who I am. I had a grudge for about three years until I ended up moving to Scunthorpe.</p>
      <p>“Even then, when I played them at youth level, a lot of the lads I played with were still there, so I had a bit of a grudge then, but I’m a grown man now.</p>
      <p>“It’s not really at the forefront of my mind. I’m not thinking anyone there is bothered about it, other than a few friends from school who will text me because they are Bradford fans.”</p>
      <p>He added: “It worked out for me so, in many ways, it was a blessing in disguise.”</p>
