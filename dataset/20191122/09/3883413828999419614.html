      <p>British children whose parents have died in Syria are to be brought back to the UK, according to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.</p>
      <p>The Save the Children charity has praised the decision to repatriate a number of the orphans caught up in the <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/what-happening-syria">Middle Eastern conflict</a>.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Mr Raab said: "These innocent, orphaned children should never have been subjected to the horrors of war.</p>
      <p>"We have facilitated their return home because it was the right thing to do.</p>

      <p>"Now they must be allowed the privacy and given the support to return to a normal life."</p>
      <p>The Foreign Office has not released any further details at this stage, but the group is expected to return to the UK within the next few days.</p>
      <p>The repatriation follows a visit by the UK's Special Envoy to Syria to the region, Martin Longden.</p>
      <p>Dr Abdulkarim Omar, the de facto foreign minister of the self-styled Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, announced that three children were handed over to the UK.</p>

      <p>Mr Raab told MPs last month that, as long as there was "no security threat", children rescued from the <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/president-trump-syria-ceasefire-permanent">fighting in northern Syria</a> could be allowed to return home.</p>
      <p>Former Brexit Secretary David Davis warned in a Commons debate in October that vulnerable British children risked "turning into terrorists" if they were not brought back.</p>

      <p>It is believed that approximately 60 children are being held in Syria by West-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurdish militia-led group that <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/syria-kurdish-forces-evacuate-contested-border-town-during-ceasefire">came under Turkish attack for most of October</a>.</p>
      <p>Former Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt praised the government's action, but urged the UK not to "forget our obligations to all British children in that terrible situation, orphans or not".</p>
      <p>Save the Children's head of humanitarian campaigns, Alison Griffin, labelled the move a "triumph of compassion in the face of cruelty".</p>
