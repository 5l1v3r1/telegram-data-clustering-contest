      <h1>Graham Norton to host 2020 Baftas ceremony</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/graham-norton">Graham Norton</a> will host next year’s Baftas ceremony, taking over the role from Joanna Lumley, who hosted for two years following the departure of longtime emcee Stephen Fry.</p>
      <p>Norton, 56, is best known as the host of the UK’s leading late-night chatshow, broadcast on Friday nights, which regularly features a starry lineup of guests. He hosted the TV Baftas 15 years ago, but this will be his first appearance introducing the film awards.</p>
      <p>“I’m delighted to be taking the helm of the biggest night in British film. The audience at the Royal Albert Hall will be the biggest sofa I’ve ever faced,” said Norton. “I’m honoured to be following in the fabulous footsteps of Stephen Fry and Joanna Lumley.”</p>
      <p>Fry hosted for six years at the start of the 21st century, before Jonathan Ross – then presenter of the BBC’s flagship film reviews show – took over for five. Fry then returned for another six years before Lumley replaced him in 2018.</p>
      <p>While many felt that Fry’s time in front of the podium had come to a protracted end, Lumley’s tenure <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/11/baftas-award-ceremony">dismayed audiences</a> both inside and outside the Royal Albert Hall.</p>
      <p>The appointment of Norton will likely prove popular with home viewers and film academy members. Norton’s easy manner with A-listers on his show – who, in a break from the US tradition, share the sofa simultaneously – has won him much praise and respect.</p>
      <p>TV ratings for the Baftas ceremony fell again in 2019, a drop blamed on increasing viewer apathy to critically acclaimed cinema and to Bafta’s decision to continue broadcasting the ceremony with an almost two-hour delay, meaning anyone with access to social media would already know the results.</p>
      <p>This year’s Oscars were a hostless affair following the departure of Kevin Hart after a series of homophobic tweets were unearthed. That ceremony was perceived to be one of the strongest in years and it is expected the US Academy will repeat the format in 2020.</p>
      <p>The Bafta nominations will be announced on 7 January 2020 before the awards ceremony on 2 February. The Oscars take place a week later, on 9 February.</p>
