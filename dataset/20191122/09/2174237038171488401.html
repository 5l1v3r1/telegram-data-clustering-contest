      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/ozzy-osbourne-solo-albums-ranked-from-worst-to-best">Ozzy Osbourne</a> has released his new single <i>Straight To Hell</i>, which features a guest appearance from <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/bikers-fire-hoses-and-looting-the-story-of-the-guns-n-roses-fan-riot-in-st-louis">Guns N’ Roses</a> guitarist <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/slash-interview-rejoining-guns-n-roses-lemmys-last-days-and-the-metoo-minefield">Slash</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s the second track taken from Ozzy’s upcoming album <i>Ordinary Man</i> and follows <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/ozzy-announces-new-album-ordinary-man-listen-to-first-single-under-the-graveyard"><i>Under The Graveyard</i></a> which arrived earlier this month. Check it out below.</p>
      <p>The follow-up to 2010’s <i>Scream</i> is expected to be released in January through Epic Records, with Ozzy joined on the album by Slash's GNR bandmate bassist Duff McKagan, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/buyers-guide-how-to-buy-the-best-of-red-hot-chili-peppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>’ drummer Chad Smith and former California Breed man Andrew Watt on guitar.</p>
      <p>It was confirmed earlier this week that <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/ozzy-osbourne-will-make-his-live-comeback-in-november">Ozzy would take to the stage at the American Music Awards</a> at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on November 24, where he’ll perform <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/listen-to-ozzy-osbournes-post-malone-collaboration-take-what-you-want"><i>Take What You Want</i></a> with Post Malone, Travis Scott and Andrew Watt. </p>
      <p>It was expected to be Ozzy’s return to live action after he was forced to postpone all of his 2019 touring plans. </p>
      <p>However, at The Forum in Los Angeles last night, the former <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/black-sabbath-a-guide-to-their-best-albums">Black Sabbath</a> frontman surprised fans at Post Malone’s show by appearing onstage to sing the track along with Travis Scott.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/ozzy-osbourne-announces-rescheduled-no-more-tours-2-uk-and-european-dates">Ozzy's postponed 2019 tour dates have been rescheduled for 2020</a>, while the official video for <i>Straight To Hell</i> will be released soon.</p>
