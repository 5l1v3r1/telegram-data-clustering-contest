      <p>Tesla has unveiled its first electric pickup truck, known as CyberTruck.</p>
      <p>The futuristic-looking vehicle will be released at the end of 2021, and with a range of up to 500 miles.</p>
      <p>Tesla says the vehicle has “more utility than a truck, with more performance than a sports car”, while company boss Elon Musk attempted to show its ruggedness during a live demonstration at the launch event in Los Angeles.</p>

      <p>In a bizarre series of demos, Mr Musk first had Tesla head of design Franz von Holzhausen hit the door of the truck repeatedly with a sledgehammer, before suggesting it was nearly bulletproof.</p>
      <p>However, when attempting to show off the CyberTruck’s supposedly shatterproof armoured glass by having Mr von Holzhausen throw a metal ball at it, the glass broke.</p>
      <p>This led a clearly sheepish Mr Musk to say “at least it didn’t go through” and that there was “room for improvement”.</p>
      <p>Tesla also said the top of the range, triple electric motor version of the CyberTruck would be capable of going from zero to 60 miles an hour in 2.9 seconds – comparable with many sports cars.</p>
      <p>The truck will start at 39,900 dollars (£31,000) for the single motor version and can be pre-ordered now, Mr Musk said.</p>
      <p>He had teased the idea of creating a truck for some time, first tweeting about building a truck in 2012, before including the idea in his so-called “master plan” for the company, published in 2016.</p>
      <p>Mr Musk also referenced the unusual design of the CyberTruck last year, saying in an interview with Recode that the vehicle had taken on a “futuristic-like cyberpunk, ‘Blade Runner'” design.</p>
      <p>As part of the announcement, Mr Musk also unveiled a quad bike built by the company, which can fit into the back of the CyberTruck and also be charged once there.</p>
