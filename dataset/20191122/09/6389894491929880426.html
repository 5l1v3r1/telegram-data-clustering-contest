      <h1>UK private sector output suffers worst fall in over three years</h1>

      <p>The UK’s private sector suffered its sharpest fall in output since July 2016, according to new survey data, as activity in the services sector fell, confounding expectations.</p>
      <p>Respondents to the survey by data firm IHS Markit said a lack of clarity over Brexit as well as fresh uncertainty due to the General Election weighed on growth.</p>
      <p>The private sector purchasing managers’ index (PMI) – a closely-watched gauge of activity – fell significantly to 48.5 in November, down from 50 in October. A score of under 50 indicates contraction.</p>
      <p>Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, said: “With an upcoming general election adding to Brexit-related uncertainty about the outlook, it’s no surprise to see UK businesses reporting falling output and orders in November.”</p>
      <p>“The weak survey data puts the economy on course for a 0.2% drop in GDP in the fourth quarter.”</p>
