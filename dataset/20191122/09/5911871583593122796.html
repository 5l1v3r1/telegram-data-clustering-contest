      <p>PartyNextDoor is one of the few artists on Drake’s OVO Sound label who has become a successful entity in his own right, who can legitimately be called a peer and not just an underling. It’s easy to forget what a significant presence Party became this decade because he hasn’t released anything as a lead artist since the <i>Seven Days</i> EP in 2017, and he hasn’t appeared on any songs at all since Calvin Harris’ “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1982334/calvin-harris-nuh-ready-nuh-ready-feat-partynextdoor-video/video/">Nuh Ready Nuh Ready</a>” way back in February of 2018. That’s a long hibernation period by the standards of today’s hip-hop and R&amp;B landscape, but he’s finally emerging today with two songs that mark the beginning of the lead-up to a new album called <i>Club Atlantis</i>.</p>
      <p>Party’s first two songs of 2019 are called “Loyal” and “The News.” Produced by Dregotjuice, OG Parker, and 40, the former is a floaty dancehall dreamscape that will probably garner more attention because it’s a Drake collaboration. But the latter, a Hoskins and Bizness Boi production, is by far the superior track — partially because it sounds like an early Drake record, with all the impeccable drowsy atmospherics and sleek melodic cooing that entails.</p>
