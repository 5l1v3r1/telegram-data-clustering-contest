      <p><b>New Delhi: </b>The Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH) led by Maulana Mahmood Madani on Thursday decided not to file a review petition on Supreme Court's verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case.</p>
      <p>The JUH working committee met on Thursday and adopted a resolution describing the judgement as 'the darkest spot in history of free India,' but decided not to go in for a review petition,<i> The Indian Express</i> reported.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The JUH which is led by senior Deoband teacher Maulana Arshad Madani and the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) had earlier this week said that they would file a review petition within the 30-day period.</p>
      <p>The Madani faction of the Jamiat said that it was not against the other parties filing a petition, but did not want to indulge in filing a review itself as it would only cause further damage.</p>
      <p>The Jamiat resolution adopted on Thursday reads: “The working committee of Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH) holds the recent Supreme Court verdict on Babri mosque unjust and overwhelmingly one-sided. It has confirmed that the mosque was not built after demolishing any temple but there existed a mosque for several hundred years which was demolished and now the court has paved the way for construction of a temple over its site. As such the judgment is the darkest spot in the history of free India. In such a situation we cannot expect any better award from the concerned judges. Rather, there is possibility of further damage. Therefore, the working committee considers that filing a review petition will not be fruitful.”</p>
