      <h2>The mum of eight has an amazing attitude about the situation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:21:30+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/authors/blathin-de-paor/" target="_blank">Blathin de Paor</a></address>
      <p>Miriam O’Callaghan has admitted she will willingly take a pay cut if it comes to it.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month RTE confirmed they are planning a major restructure which will involve job losses and pay cuts as they plan to address the key issues facing the organisation.</p>
      <p>The statement confirmed the station would be seeking 200 job cuts as well as cutting their top presenters pay.</p>
      <p>And the presenter revealed she willl happily take the cut to help the broadcaster out.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the An Post Irish Book awards on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/miriam-o-callaghan">Miriam</a> told the Irish Mirror: “I haven’t had any meetings yet but of course I will not be found wanting.</p>
      <p>“What I mean by that is of course if <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/rte">RTÉ</a> is in trouble and the Director General asks me for a cut, well then obviously I will be willing to take that cut.</p>
      <p>“Honestly I don’t do stress. I couldn’t be bothered. We’re in this life for too short of a time. I don’t do stress. I love, love, love my job.</p>
      <p>“I’m grateful for it everyday, so happy. I love RTÉ. I’m passionate about the place. I’m passionate about public service broadcasting.”</p>
      <p>She added: “I’m one of life’s glass half full people. I’m a very positive person so I live my life waking up every morning grateful that I am alive and my children are healthy.</p>

      <p>“And I’m going to work and I love my job. Obviously like different places at different times, RTÉ is going through it’s own major problems but all I ever say is what we need to do is what I did last night on air is go out and do a rocking good prime time and a rocking good radio show.</p>
      <p>“At the end of the day I’m not a manager, I don’t control the place, I am not in charge of its overall destiny. All I can is for the listeners and viewers of Ireland is to provide them with good shows and that is what I try to do.</p>
      <p>While recently Ryan Tubridy also revealed he was hopeful RTE would survive the current financial difficulty the station had found itself in.</p>
      <p>Speaking to TV Now magazine, <a href="https://ww.rsvplive.ie/all-about/latelateshow">The Late Late Show</a> host revealed: "I think we're going to survive. We're in a strange place but the omens are good because the country needs public service broadcasting and we do that and we do it really well.</p>
      <p>"I think that if people reflect on what we do for news and for entertainment and for things lke the way we had a national wake for Gay, or the Toy Show coming up, they are things that people like and want to enjoy and have as event TV, but also they are national moments when we come together" he continued.</p>
      <p>"I think RTE is deemed really important and there are difficult times financially but they are working on it and there will be a bit of pain to get there and we have to reassess and that is what's been happening."</p>
