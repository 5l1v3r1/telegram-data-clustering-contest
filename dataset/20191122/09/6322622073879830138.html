      <p>LONDON (Nov 22): Euro zone business growth almost ground to a halt this month as activity in the bloc's dominant services industry increased at a much weaker pace than expected and among manufacturers it contracted again, a survey showed on Friday.</p>
      <p>IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a reliable guide to economic health, was 50.3, down from October's 50.6 and moving towards the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.</p>
      <p>That was below all expectations in a <i>Reuters </i>poll which had predicted 50.9 and only just shy of a more than six-year low reading in September.</p>
      <p>November's PMI points to GDP growth of 0.1% this quarter, IHS Markit said, slower than the 0.2% last quarter and the 0.2% prediction in a <i>Reuters </i>poll last week.</p>
      <p>Worryingly for policymakers at the European Central Bank, who have so far failed to stoke demand and inflation, new business fell for a third month. The sub-index was 49.7, albeit just above October's 49.6.</p>
      <p>A PMI for the bloc's dominant service industry dropped to a 10-month low of 51.5 from 52.2. That was also below all expectations in a <i>Reuters </i>poll in which the median forecast was for 52.5.</p>
      <p>Manufacturers produced slightly more positive news, but their PMI showed activity contracted for a 10th month. The factory PMI rose to 46.6 from 45.9, above the median forecast for 46.4.</p>
      <p>An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, rose to 47.1 from 46.6. That contraction was despite factories cutting the prices of their goods for a fifth month.</p>
      <p>Once more, with demand falling a chunk of that production was derived from completing backlogs of work and factories again reduced headcount and cut back on purchases of raw materials.</p>
      <p>Also probably of concern for policymakers, services firms likewise filled old orders faster than new ones came in and curtailed hiring, suggesting there won't be a turnaround anytime soon.</p>
      <p>That meant optimism dwindled to its lowest since mid-2013. The services business expectations index dropped to 57.0 from 57.4.</p>
