      <p>When caring for a loved one at home, full time, it’s important to take the opportunity to have a rest and recharge your batteries.</p>
      <p>Part of Sanctuary Care, Sherwood Forest Residential and Nursing Home in Normanton provides short-term respite care breaks to give you this deserved time, whilst assuring you that your loved one will be well cared for.</p>
      <p>Based on Village Street, the home offers respite care for anything from one to six weeks, enabling carers to take a holiday or simply a break of their own, safe in the knowledge that their loved one is being cared for by the team.</p>

      <p>One carer, Elsie looks after her husband Jack, who has Parkinson’s disease, and books regular respite breaks with Sanctuary Care for Jack, so that she can have a couple of weeks to herself, with the peace of mind that her husband is safe and happy.</p>
      <p>Elsie said, "Respite care is a blessing and the freedom it gives me is remarkable. It is a wonderful care home, the team are lovely and Jack is happy there."</p>
