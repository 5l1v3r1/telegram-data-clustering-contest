      <p>Consumer confidence in Singapore has sunk to a two-year low according to Conference Board Global Consumer Confidence Survey, in collaboration with global data firm Nielsen, as concerns swirl over job security and the economy.</p>
      <p>In their report on Thursday (21 November), Nielsen said Singaporeans are most worried about health, work-life balance and increasing food prices as well.</p>
      <p>In a poll of 500 people, the report found that 37% of respondents were concerned about the economy in the third quarter of 2019, up from 32% in the second quarter. Additionally, in this third quarter of the year, the number of people concerned about job security stayed level at 32%. Even so, about 34% said they were optimistic about job prospects, but that is a sharp decline from 42% just the previous quarter.</p>
      <p>In terms of the broader economy, about 56% of respondents believe that Singapore is in a recession, again up 42% from the previous quarter.</p>
      <p>This concern is not entirely unsupported as the latest data shows Singapore’s economic growth slowing to 0.1% in the third quarter, only narrowly avoiding a technical recession.</p>
      <p>Given these concerns, it’s also no surprise that the respondents seem slightly less willing to spend this quarter than they did before with 37% saying they were willing to spend on wants and needs, compared to 38% in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>There was also a 1% dip in people saying they would still spend on travel for their holidays, from 46% in the second quarter to 45% in the third quarter; and those who are willing to spend on new tech gadgets, from 17% to 16%. A bigger decline was the percentage of respondents willing to spend on new clothes, going from 22% to 19%.</p>
      <p>The report also found that savings continue to be a top priority for consumers given economic uncertainties. About 62% said they would put their money into savings while 33% said they would invest in retirement funds.</p>
      <p>About 28% said they would invest in shares or mutual funds, a slight increase from 27% in the previous quarter.</p>
      <p>A year ago in the third quarter of 2018, consumer confidence was at 98%. A year before that in 2017, it was 89% – same as it is now in the third quarter of 2019. However, just before that in the second quarter of 2017, consumer confidence was at 86%.</p>
