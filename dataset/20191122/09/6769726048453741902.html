      <p>Ms Hart said the awards had a significant number of entries again in 2019, despite challenging market conditions.</p>
      <p>“The designs and workmanship detail to come out of this year’s winners is a true example of what our members are capable of delivering in Western Australia,’’ she said.</p>
      <p>“All of the winners and finalists winners have really showcased their commitment and dedication to their clients and the residential housing industry’’.</p>
      <p>WA Housing Minister Peter Tinley also attended the 2019 HIA CSR Western Australian Housing Awards with an audience of 250 HIA members and industry professionals to celebrate the success of WA’s best residential builders.</p>
      <p>Ms Hart said the award finalists were made up of winners from the Great Southern, Mid West, South West and Perth HIA regional housing awards.</p>
