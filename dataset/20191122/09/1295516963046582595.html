      <p>Though <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/arrow/">Arrow</a> is coming to an end soon, the legacy of Oliver Queen will continue through his adult daughter from the future, Mia -- who has come to the past with her half-brother William and possible love interest Connor Hawke, the adopted son of John Diggle.</p>
      <p>However, complicating that potential romance is the presence of Connor's evil brother, John "JJ" Diggle Jr., the leader of the Deathstroke Gang whom Mia had some romantic intrigue with in the Season 8 premiere before he revealed his true identity. According to Mia's actor Katherine McNamara, the series will continue to tease the love triangle between the three.</p>

      <p>While speaking with <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/18/arrow-katherine-mcnamara-russia-season-8-episode-5-preview/">Entertainment Weekly</a>, McNamara was asked if future episodes would explore the love triangle, and what was going with it.</p>
      <p>"Let me put it this way: The Queen family and the Diggle family are always connected," she answered. "We’ve seen the bromance with Oliver and John, and there’s definitely something going on with Mia and the Diggle brothers as we move forward, but I can’t really get into that now."</p>
      <p>Airing Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on The CW, <i>Arrow</i>'s final season stars Stephen Amell as Oliver Queen, David Ramsey as John Diggle, Rick Gonzalez as Wild Dog, Juliana Harkavy as Black Canary, Katie Cassidy as <a href="https://screenrant.com/arrow-black-siren-laurel-hero/">Black Siren</a>, Katherine McNamara as Mia Smoak, Joseph David-Jones as Connor Hawke and Ben Lewis as William Clayton-Queen.</p>
