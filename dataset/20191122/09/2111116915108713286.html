      <p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/amazon-black-friday-deals-2019">Amazon's Black Friday sale</a> has started early, and there are huge savings to be had on Amazon's own devices, including Fire TV Sticks. These are a super affordable way to stream TV shows, videos and movies straight to any TV, and with £20 they're even more tempting.</p>
      <p>There are two Fire TV Sticks included in the Black Friday sale: the regular version, which streams at 1080p, and the 4K model, which is perfect if your TV has a higher resolution. Both come with an Alexa-enabled remote, so you can simply speak to search for what you want to watch (no fiddly typing).</p>
      <p>Whichever one you choose, just plug it into your TV, connect its power cable, and you're ready to start watching.</p>
      <p>These are the best prices we've seen for this pair of streaming sticks (other retailers are still selling them for full price), so move quickly to snap one up.</p>
