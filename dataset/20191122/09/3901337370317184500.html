      <p>
        <b>Option 1: Luis Figo (2000-2005)</b>
      </p>
      <p>After a successful stint with FC Barcelona, Luis Figo became Real Madrid's top transfer target. The former Portugal international moved to the Spanish capital for a then-world record fee of £37 million (R703 million) from the Catalan club. Exceptionally strong, powerful, and a great crosser of the ball, Figo was a winger supreme. In his five years at Los Blancos, he made 245 appearances, scoring 56 goals and assisting a further 93 strikes. The 47-year-old also won the UEFA Champions League, two LaLiga titles, one UEFA Super Cup, and four Spanish Super Cups with Los Blancos.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Option 2: David Beckham (2003-2007)</b>
      </p>
      <p>David Beckham became a Galactico in 2003, after his move from Manchester United. Known for his accurate range of passing, his deadly crosses, and bending free-kicks, he fit into the squad of stars like a glove. At the Santiago Bernabeu, he established himself as one of the leaders in the team and was loved by the Los Blancos faithful. Over his four-year stay at the club, he made 115 appearances, scoring 20 goals and assisting a further 48 strikes. He capped his time at the club by winning one LaLiga title in addition to a Spanish Super Cup.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Option 3: Gareth Bale (2013-present)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Blessed with exceptional pace and a wand of a left foot, Wales captain Gareth Bale joined Real in 2013, costing a mammoth fee of £85.3 million (R1.6 billion). Despite the issues Bale has had with current manager Zinedine Zidane, few can question his place in the club's history books. His sensational goal in the 2017/18 UEFA Champions League final against Liverpool in Ukraine is one of the many highlights of his Los Blancos career. To date, the right-winger has won four UEFA Champions League titles, three UEFA Super Cups, four FIFA Club World Cups, one Spanish Super Cup, and one LaLiga title with the Madrid club.  </p>
