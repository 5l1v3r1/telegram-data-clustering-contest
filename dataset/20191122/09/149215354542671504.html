      <p>Tesla has the world's top-selling electric car, the Model 3, but while it is taking aim at Detroit's rich truck market, "Ford and GM are also gearing up to challenge Tesla more directly with new offerings like the Ford Mustang Mach E electric SUV as well as electric pickups," <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-pickup/teslas-electric-pickup-truck-flouts-convention-with-angular-design-and-armored-glass-idUSKBN1XW0BT"><i>Reuters</i> notes</a>. Musk has said the Cybertruck's polarizing design was inspired by the Lotus Esprit used by James Bond in <i>The Spy Who Loved Me</i> and also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18055158/elon-musk-tesla-pickup-truck-bladerunner-futuristic">referred to it</a> a "futuristic-like cyberpunk, <i>Blade Runner</i>" design.
