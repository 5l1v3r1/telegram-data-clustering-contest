      <h1>SAA Scrambling To Secure Funds For Day-to-Day Operations</h1>

      <p>JOHANNESBURG – South African Airways (SAA) is scrambling to secure funding to run day-to-day operations and also pay salaries for the month.</p>
      <p>On day eight of the crippling strike, it is hoped that workers will accept management’s latest offer, which is set to be presented to them on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Members of trade unions Sacca and Numsa are demanding an 8% salary increase and a halt to restructuring plans.</p>
      <p>SAA has advised workers to make arrangements with their banks because it is not guaranteed that they will be paid.</p>
      <p>The airline’s Tlali Tlali: “The airline has yet to finalise the process of raising R2 billion in the form of working capital to fund its day-to-day operations and these extend to and include the payment of salaries. The airline remains optimistic that the issue will soon be resolved.”</p>
      <p>The South African Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) said it is not surprised that SAA would not be able to pay salaries on time this month amid a crippling strike.</p>
      <p>Workers at the airline have been on strike for exactly a week now, demanding a pay hike.</p>
      <p>It is estimated that SAA has been losing R50 million a day during the strike, which began last Friday.</p>
      <p>They are also opposed to SAA’s restructuring plans that could result in job losses.</p>
      <p>The embattled airline, which has tried in vain to negotiate with unions, said it continued to try to secure the required funding to meet its financial obligations.</p>
      <p>Sacca president Zazi Sibanyoni-Mugambi said: “This is not the first time this has happened. It happened earlier on this year. Salaries were delayed, it’s not that much of a shock and had to explain this to members and we’ve done the same this time.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>CALLING FOR FAIR SALARY OFFER</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sacca said it was taking what it called a fair salary offer back to members on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa and Sacca are demanding that the cash-strapped airline stop with its restructuring plans, which could result in job losses.</p>
      <p>The embattled airline which has tried in vain to negotiate with unions said it continues to try to secure required funding to meet its financial obligations.</p>
      <p>Sacca president Zazi Sibanyoni-Mugambi said: “Once our members give us a thumbs up, the strike might be over but it’s up to the members that mandated us.”</p>
