      <h1>Jose Mourinho 'to earn £2m bonus if Tottenham Hotspur make top four'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a> will reportedly earn an additional £2m on top of his current salary should he manage to lead <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> to a top-four finish this season.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:51:06+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:51</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Law</a></address>
      <p>The Portuguese, who replaced <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a> as head coach earlier this week, has signed a contract at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium until the end of the 2022-23 campaign.</p>
      <p>Spurs are currently 14th in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">Premier League table</a>, some 11 points off fourth-placed Manchester City ahead of Saturday's clash with bitter rivals West Ham United.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>The Sun</i>, Mourinho will be paid a £2m bonus should he turn the team's form around and lead them into a Champions League spot come the end of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Pochettino led Spurs to last season's European Cup final but a poor start to the new campaign saw the Argentine relieved of his duties during the international break.</p>
      <p>Both Barcelona and Bayern Munich <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/news/barca-join-bayern-in-battle-for-pochettino_380137.html">are believed</a> to be interested in appointing the 47-year-old as their new head coach, who would have previously cost a sizeable sum due to his contract in London.</p>
