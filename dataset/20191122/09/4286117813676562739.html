      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Sarpanch attempts to stop anti-encroachment drive</li>
        <li>Hangs on to JCB machine, ignoring cries of alarm</li>
        <li>Incident took place on Thursday, November 21</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rekha Devi hung tight when the loader's bright, yellow arm jerked as if to goad her into disembarking.</p>
      <p>She clung on -- drawing her legs closer for strength, ignoring the cries piercing the air-- as the machine retreated across the unpaved ground, its driver steering frantically.</p>
      <p>She still had a hand on the loader when it rose to seek refuge in height. A turbaned villager who had stayed behind her wisely helped her down.</p>
      <p>This was an anti-encroachment drive: one about which Rekha Devi, the sarpach of Mandawala village (Jalore) in Rajasthan, obviously had strong feelings.</p>
      <p>Back on terra firma, she was still pointing in the direction of the JCB machine as it fell back further.</p>
      <p>Then it suddenly braked. Its front end rose and crashed with a thunderous peal, almost sounding furious for having been thwarted.</p>
      <p>You can watch the extraordinary video, filmed on November 21, right here.</p>

      <p>This isn't the first time in recent months that an anti-encroachment drive in Rajasthan has run into controversy.</p>
      <p>In August, a JCB operator suffered injuries in a clash between villagers and police in Taausar, located in Nagaur district.</p>
