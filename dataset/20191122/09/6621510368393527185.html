      <p><b>ISLAMABAD:</b> Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Friday said that Indian minorities particularly Muslims were living at the mercy of Hindutva ideologues.</p>
      <p>Qureshi said that the atmosphere has been persistently tense in the neighboring country after the Babri mosque verdict which attracted controversy at home and abroad.</p>
      <p>“Attacks are taking place on Muslims in India, Hindutva poses serious threats to sane Indians and the minorities alike,” Qureshi continued.</p>
      <p>He urged the international community to wake up from their slumber and take action on the unilateral oppression India has been imposing on innocent Kashmiris.</p>
      <p>“They should show maturity and fulfill their obligations, feel a sense of responsibility, India has put the region’s peace and stability on stake due to its hegemonic ambitions.”</p>
      <p>Unprecedented military siege and communications clampdown continue on the 110th consecutive day on Friday (today), in Indian occupied Kashmir.</p>
