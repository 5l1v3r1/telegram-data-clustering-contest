      <p>There's nothing that says <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> quite like the scent you smell walking into a room where there's a real Christmas tree.</p>
      <p>Not only does a real Christmas tree smell divine, it looks great, and choosing the perfect one should be as much a part of the festive tradition as pulling crackers and singing carols.</p>
      <p>Here's your chance to win a real Christmas tree, that you can pick yourself, courtesy of Edelweiss Christmas Tree Company.</p>
