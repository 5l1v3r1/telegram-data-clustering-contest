      <h1>Captaincy has not affected Jason Kerr’s St Johnstone form</h1>
      <h2>The St Johnstone captaincy hasn’t been a burden this season, Jason Kerr insisted.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/ericnicolson/" target="_blank">Eric Nicolson</a></address>
      <p>And the centre-back certainly isn’t searching for excuses for his “up and down” form.</p>
      <p>“Being captain hasn’t weighed heavily on me,” said Kerr, who succeeded Joe Shaughnessy as McDiarmid Park skipper in the summer. “It hasn’t affected me.</p>
      <p>“It’s obviously a bit different when you’re captain but that’s mainly off the pitch.</p>
      <p>“On the pitch it hasn’t changed the way I play or anything like that.</p>
      <p>“I have just made more mistakes that I have made before. That’s what it’s been down to.</p>
      <p>“I am not making any excuses because I know I have been up and down this season.</p>
      <p>“It’s easy to look at being made captain and think that I have been doing everything different.</p>
      <p>“But it hasn’t affected me on the field at all. I feel the same as I did before I was made captain.</p>
      <p>“It’s just down to making too many mistakes.”</p>
      <p>Kerr added: “We are an inexperienced back four and that’s what’s going to happen at times.</p>
      <p>“We just have to work hard as a group to make sure we can cut them out as much as possible.</p>
      <p>“Against Hearts I felt I was back to my best, but in the Hibs game it was my mistake that let them score.</p>
      <p>“That kind of summed up the season so far.</p>
      <p>“All you can do is work hard, keep learning and then hopefully things will turn for you.”</p>
      <p>The two Edinburgh sides brought out the Jekyll and Hyde of this St Johnstone team recently.</p>
      <p>“We were happy to get a clean sheet against Hearts so to then lose a goal so early against Hibs was really frustrating,” Kerr reflected.</p>
      <p>“We thought we’d turned the corner a bit in that Hearts game but the goal we lost was a bad one and the performance afterwards wasn’t good enough.</p>
      <p>“The international break came at the wrong time because we wanted to get out there playing again to put it right.</p>
      <p>“It was individual mistakes again and I was to blame against Kamberi at the start.</p>
      <p>“We have been making far too many errors. The gaffer has been over it with us because we need to nip it in the bud.</p>
      <p>“If we can stop it then we can go on and have a good season but we need to eradicate it quickly.”</p>
      <p>Aberdeen are Saints’ next opponents on Sunday and their main attacking threat needs no underlining.</p>
      <p>Kerr said: “We had a good performance against Aberdeen last time up there at Pittodrie.</p>
      <p>“I thought we were solid for most of the game up there, but they always pose a threat to you.</p>
      <p>“Sam Cosgrove is a good striker. He’s big, strong and has good movement so you have to be on your game to keep him quiet.</p>
      <p>“I felt I did well against Ikpeazu at Hearts along with Wallace Duffy. We figured out early what he was going to do and stopped him from doing it.</p>
      <p>“Cosgrove is bigger and better in the air than he is, so while it’s a sort of similar test they are different players.</p>
      <p>“It’s not just about a physical game with him, he’s smart and his goals record just shows how much he can punish you.”</p>
      <p>Kerr is hoping that the script is written for Stevie May to be the Perth hero against his old club.</p>
      <p>“It was good for Stevie to get a goal against Hibs and that will do his confidence a world of good,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully this weekend he’ll be able to get another one and scoring in back-to-back games would be great.”</p>
