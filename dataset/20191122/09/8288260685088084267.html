      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:38:29+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:38</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Suart, https://www.facebook.com/West-Brom-reporter-Paul-Suart-1706553162899720/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Batsman Adam Hose hopes there’s more silverware to come in Warwickshire colours after signing a two-year contract extension. Hose, who joined the club from Somerset in 2017, has penned a new deal tying him to the Bears until the end of the 2022 season after flourishing in all forms of the game.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old was part of the teams who reached the Vitality Blast final in 2017 and won Division Two of the County Championship in 2018. Hose said: “It’s a special club and I’m very proud to be a Bear until at least 2022.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The management have shown great faith in me by extending my contract and I want to reward them by contributing more match-winning innings. “We demonstrated that this young squad has character and could fight when the chips were down last season.</p>
      <p>“With so many young players in the squad, we’re going to be much stronger from the 2019 experience and, if we can keep developing, we have every chance of being in a position to challenge for trophies again soon.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Hose has become a regular fixture across all three formats at Edgbaston, having made 15 first class, seven List A and 32 T20 appearances to date. His impressive credentials in T20 cricket saw him recruited by Wellington Firebirds in the 2018/19 Super Smash in New Zealand. He has also been drafted by Birmingham Phoenix for the inaugural season of The Hundred.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I absolutely love playing for this club and with all the lads,’’ said Hose. “Ever since my very first game for the Bears I have felt really at home. “I think it helped that I arrived at a time when other lads were coming in and just settling in and we came through together. There is a great spirit here and I am just proud to be part of the squad.”</p>
      <p>Hose’s powerful batting has proved an effective weapon in the white-balls formats, however, he was not as productive as hoped for in red-ball cricket last season and high on his agenda for this winter is a lot of hard work to rectify that.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>2020 campaign will bring added dimension for Hose</h3>
      <p>“The championship season wasn’t easy for me,” he said. “Really, I just had the one innings, the century at home to Nottinghamshire, where I felt comfortable. “I am working on a few technical issues. I’m having a couple of batting sessions a week and will be working hard on a few things over the winter.</p>
      <p>“A lot of the lads are back in now and there is a really good buzz about the place. I know some people might not agree with this, but I think, in hindsight, we can take a lot from last season in the championship.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We had lost some senior players from the previous season and then to get hammered by injuries made it really tough, but it was brilliant to see the likes of Dom Sibley, Will Rhodes, Olly Hannon-Dalby and Henry Brookes really step up.</p>
      <p>“Considering that, at one stage, every seamer on the staff was injured, the lads did really well. Now we have got some big players coming back to fitness again and I think we could really challenge next season.” The 2020 campaign will bring an added dimension for Hose as a Phoenix player in The Hundred.</p>
      <p>“It’s a really exciting prospect,” he said. “Just looking at the eight teams, every squad has world-class players in it and, as a professional, these are the people you want to be playing with and against,</p>
      <p>“I’m just looking forward to sharing a dressing room with the likes of Kane Williamson and seeing the way he goes about his work and learning from him.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/warwickshire-ccc">Warwickshire sport director</a> Paul Farbrace added: “Adam is a tremendously talented cricketer who has the ability to become a star of the white-ball game, not just in the UK but in premier tournaments around the world.</p>
      <p>“However, we also see Adam as an important part of our long-term plans in all three formats and his challenge now is to refine his red-ball game. “We know he is very motivated by this opportunity and have every confidence that Adam can continue developing to make more match-winning contributions.”</p>
