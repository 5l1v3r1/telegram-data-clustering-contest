        <b>John Ameh, Abuja</b>
      </p>
      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari and All Progressives Congress leaders are set for the party’s National Executive Committee meeting to be held today.</p>
      <p>On Thursday night, the President, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, the National Chairman of the party, Mr. Adams Oshiomhole, the leadership of the National Assembly, state governors and ministers held a caucus meeting at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, preparatory for today’s NEC meeting.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the meeting had ended, Oshiomhole said the caucus meeting was like the “elders’ council,” where issues affecting the party in recent times were reviewed.</p>
      <p>He said one of the issues was the performance of the party in the general elections held earlier in the year.</p>
      <p>Oshiomhole also said next year’s budget and some disciplinary issues in the party were discussed.</p>
      <p>“You know it’s a meeting of national caucus. Basically, it is just to review the performance in the last elections, current issues, next year’s budget, and disciplinary issues.</p>
      <p>“You know caucus is like an elders’ council to speak on a lot of things that we will discuss at NEC on Friday.</p>
      <p>He dismissed reports of being under pressure to convene the NEC meeting, saying that the date was fixed two months ago.</p>
      <p>“There is no pressure. NEC meeting was scheduled like two months ago. We are just waiting for the day to come. It was fixed two months ago. And it is taking place on Friday. Are you not aware of that?</p>
      <p>“You are talking of what Mr. Salihu Lukman (Director-General of Progressives Governors’ Forum) said. That is his opinion. Even before he said that, this meeting has been fixed.</p>
      <p>“It is normal to hold a meeting. We have a NEC meeting to look at our financial statements for previous year, budget for next year, issues that arose during and after the elections, and current outcomes of various cases that went to court — the ones we won and the ones we lost; going forward; issues in some states where we have disagreements and how to resolve the disagreements.</p>
      <p>“I think that is it. And it went very well. And you can see the president sat all through the meeting.”</p>
