      <p>HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global private equity group KKR &amp; Co (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/KKR.N">KKR.N</a>) has raised $1.5 billion for its first Asia-focused infrastructure fund, roughly half the total targeted, one person with direct knowledge said. KKR began to target Asia’s infrastructure sector with a series of hires beginning about a year ago and launched its fundraising in 2019.</p>
      <p>The source declined to be named because the information was not public. KKR declined to comment.</p>
      <p>The fundraising comes as private equity firms globally shift from focusing purely on buyouts towards becoming all-round investment houses with a series of alternative assets, such as infrastructure, real estate, hedge funds and credit.</p>
      <p>KKR has about a dozen people in the region focused on infrastructure, according to the person. It made its first investment in the sector with a $400 million deal taking control of India Grid Trust (IndiGrid).</p>
      <p>Separately, the firm has begun raising its fourth Asian private equity fund, aiming to raise $15 billion, Reuters reported this month.</p>
      <p>The firm has also been raising a real estate fund for Asia,targeting $1.5 billion, Reuters reported in March.</p>
