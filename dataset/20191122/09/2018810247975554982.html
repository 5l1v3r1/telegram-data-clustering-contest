      <p><i>Borderlands 3</i> got a big update today that, among a bunch of other additions, makes the game’s menus system less hellishly slow.</p>
      <p>When Gearbox’s loot shooter came out in September, it had a lot of <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/09/six-hours-in-borderlands-3-just-feels-like-more-borderlands-and-its-kinda-busted">performance issues</a>. Split-screen was a mess, the frame-rate frequently dropped, the inventory system would occasionally eat people’s gear, and most surprisingly, the menus felt really, really laggy. Thanks to <a href="https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-11-21-borderlands-3-patch-hotfixes-nov-21/">today’s patch</a>, though, those stuttery menus are no more. At least for the most part.</p>
      <p>The improvements were instantly noticeable on PS4 when I dipped back into the game today. While I did see one list of guns still waiting to fully populate as I rapidly swapped around my inventory, the game no longer comes to a creaking halt when you try to pull up the map or bring up the skill tree to allocate points.</p>

      <p>It’s not perfect, and Gearbox said in the patch notes that it’s still planning on implementing additional menu fixes down the road. Still, simple things like picking up a new gun, deciding what to swap out, and then checking how far I am from the objective marker on the map no longer take me out of the regular flow of the game.</p>
      <p>The update also added a new endgame activity called “Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite,” as well as a fourth level of Mayhem, additional bank space for loot, dedicated loot pools for bosses, and a bunch more vending machine locations so you’re not constantly having to throw away loot to make room for new stuff instead of selling it.</p>
