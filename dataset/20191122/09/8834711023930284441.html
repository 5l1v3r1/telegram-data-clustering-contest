      <p>CAPE TOWN – A man accused of killing and dismembering Bellville resident Lynette Volschenk is due back in the dock next month.</p>
      <p>Kyle Ruiters made a brief appearance in the Bellville Magistrates Court on Thursday.</p>
      <p>He was arrested shortly after the 32-year-old woman’s remains were found in her flat in August.</p>
      <p>The court has heard the State has wrapped up its investigation but time was needed to complete one last aspect.</p>
      <p>Evidence from a laptop had not yet been disclosed to defence lawyer Edward McCullum.</p>
      <p>The matter was postponed to 11 December.</p>
      <p>At a previous appearance, Ruiters opted to abandon his bail application.</p>
      <p>Lynette Volschenk’s colleagues found her dismembered body packed in bags in her Loevenstein flat on 22 August.</p>
      <p>They went to check up on her after she failed to arrive at work that morning.</p>
      <p>The motive for Volschenk’s murder remains unknown.</p>
