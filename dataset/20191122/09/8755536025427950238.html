      <h2>The music manager has spoken out about their public dispute</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:01:33+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://goss.ie/author/kendra" target="_blank">Kendra Becker</a></address>
      <p>Scooter Braun has finally addressed Taylor Swift’s comments about him, his company and her former record label.</p>
      <p>Their public feud erupted back in May, after Scooter’s company Ithaca Holdings bought Big Machine Label Group – which owns the rights to Taylor’s back catalogue.</p>
      <p>Speaking on stage at The Hollywood Chamber’s 2019 State of the Entertainment Industry Conference, the music manager said: “I haven’t talked about this in six months, not once… and that’s hard.”</p>
      <p>“It’s hard because when there’s a lot of things being said, and a lot of different opinions, yet the principals haven’t had a chance to speak to each other, there’s a lot of confusion.”</p>

      <p>“The only good thing for me is that when you get knocked down on some stuff, you get to find out who your real friends are real quick,” he continued.</p>
      <p>“And watching some people in the industry who, you know, might smile in your face and then suddenly you’ve got a little dent in the armour and they come try to kick it in even more. It doesn’t bother me, but it just lets me know where I stand.”</p>
      <p>Scooter declined to go into further detail, but said: “I just think we live in a time of toxic division and people thinking that social media is the appropriate place to air out each other and not have conversations.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t like politicians doing it; I don’t like anybody doing it. And if that means that I’ve got to be the bad guy longer, I’ll be the bad guy longer, but I’m not going to participate.”</p>

      <p>“What I’ll say is I think people need to communicate and when people are able to communicate, I think they work things out.”</p>
      <p>“I think that these problems that are being discussed can be discussed behind closed doors and figured out pretty easily. It’s something I’ve wanted to do for six months,” he said. “I just think it’s gotten out of hand.”</p>
      <p>“I think people need to come together and have a conversation because that’s not what this is about. It’s not what we got in this industry for,” he added.</p>
      <p>The singer branded the music manager a “bully” back in May, after his company Ithaca Holdings bought Big Machine Label Group.</p>

      <p>Taylor had been signed to Big Machine from 2006 – 2017, and the label owns the rights to her first six albums.</p>
      <p>Last week, Taylor reignited their feud once again when <a href="http://goss.ie/la-showbiz/taylor-swift-blocked-from-performing-her-own-music-amid-master-recording-battle-190738">she claimed that Scooter and the company denied her request to play some of her early songs at the upcoming American Music Awards.</a></p>
      <p>But Big Machine Records denied her allegations, and in a statement they said: “Taylor, the narrative you have created does not exist. All we ask is to have a direct and honest conversation.”</p>
      <p>“When that happens, you will see there is nothing but respect, kindness and support waiting for you on the other side. We share the collective goal of giving your fans the entertainment they both want and deserve.”</p>
