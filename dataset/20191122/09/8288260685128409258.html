      <h1>Dido is coming to Arena Birmingham - here's how to get tickets</h1>
      <h2>Her date at Arena Birmingham will be opening night of UK tour</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:39:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:39</time> by <a rel="author">Graham Young, David Bentley, https://www.facebook.com/grahamyoungfilm?ref=hl, https://www.facebook.com/davidbentleybm/</a></address>
      <p>Oscar-nominated singer-songwriter Dido has announced a Birmingham concert date.</p>
      <p>The news comes just as the No Angel star releases her new album, Still on my Mind.</p>
      <p>Last year her first tour for 15 years was announced but included just three UK dates.</p>
      <p>But a new gig at the Arena Birmingham - formerly the Barclaycard Arena and before that the National Indoor Arena - has now been confirmed for Thursday, November 28, 2019.</p>
      <p>And it will be the opening night of a seven-date UK tour.</p>

      <p>The London-born star - real name Florian Cloud de Bounevialle Armstrong but known as Dido since childhood - burst on to the scene with her debut album No Angel (1999), which has sold more than 21 million copies.</p>
      <p>Follow-up album Life for Rent (2003) included the singles White Flag and Life for Rent.</p>
      <p>Other albums followed - Safe Trip Home (2008) and Girl Who Got Away (2013).</p>
      <p>Her song Thank You was sampled on Eminem's No 1 single Stan, which brought her to the attention of US audiences.</p>
      <p>She has also been a regular contributor to Faithless, an electronica band whose members include her brother, Rollo.</p>
      <p>Her song If I Rise, performed with co-writer A R Rahman, was Oscar-nominated after featuring in the Danny Boyle film, 127 Hours - the category was won by Randy Newman's We Belong Together from Toy Story 3.</p>
