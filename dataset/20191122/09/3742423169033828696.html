      <h1>Use These Transcriptionists Instead Of Rev</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/author/nick-douglas" target="_blank">Nick Douglas</a></address>
      <p>Like <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/wework-reportedly-knew-about-its-toxic-phone-booths-for-months">WeWork</a>, <a href="https://jalopnik.com/uber-employees-use-secret-tools-to-target-drivers-and-u-1793495814">Uber</a>, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-worrying-number-of-amazon-s-warehouse-workers-are-rep-1825387691">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/09/youtube-faces-angry-mob-again-ceo-promises-to-rethink-new-verification-policy">YouTube</a>, and every tech platform you rely on to live in the 21st century, the transcription service Rev recently screwed over the people who do the actual work. They <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/transcription-platform-rev-slashes-minimum-pay-for-workers">dropped the minimum rate</a> for their contracted transcriptionists by 33 per cent, to effectively <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/there-is-a-point-where-a-person-cant-do-anymore">less than $7 an hour</a>. Luckily, there are ways to find and hire a human transcriptionist directly, without paying more money.</p>
      <p>I love the Rev platform, and <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/03/which-transcription-service-to-use-for-every-job">I’ve recommended it on this site</a>. But it feels ridiculous to hand $150 to a platform that pays a transcriptionist as little as $45. Plus I didn’t like learning that when I submit audio, it’s <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/rev-a-transcription-service-used-by-police-and-journalists-leaves-customer-data-out-in-the-open-81fff9f16669">available to thousands of people</a> until someone accepts the job transcribing it. So I looked for ways to hire transcriptionists directly.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1abewY-1yfw-43iJyF9VDAMxoVpsSVmXIndVEINYYW14/edit#gid=1800275329">Study Hall Transcribers</a>: The media newsletter and community lists over 50 transcriptionists, with base rates starting at $1/minute. To email them all, you can send a job description to studyhall-transcription@googlegroups.com. Or pick someone and email directly.</li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QSjce8hT4LjL1FWotdEpviWF_2xjGXvW1yqoe0m9cxA/edit#gid=1897526474">Resource for Podcasters</a> (Accessibility tab): Podcasting journalist Wil Williams lists a dozen transcriptionists and automated services (see more below), with email and Twitter contact info.</li>
        <li><a href="https://transcription.network/">Transcription Network</a>: A transcriptionist who <a href="https://twitter.com/thricedotted/status/1193928787857039362">wrote about Rev’s pay cut</a> is building a database of transcriptionists for hire. Sign up to get an email when it goes live.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sometimes you only need a rough transcription for internal use. These automated services are more error-prone than human transcribers, especially if your recording quality isn’t great. But they’re very helpful for taking automatic notes.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2018/06/create-searchable-audio-transcriptions-in-real-time-with-otter">Otter Voice Meeting Notes</a>: 10 hours/month free; up to 100 hours/month for $15/month. Includes extra features like keyword tracking and team sharing.</li>
        <li><a href="https://cheaptranscription.io/">Cheap Transcription</a>: 15 cents/minute</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.temi.com/">Temi</a>: 15 cents/minute</li>
        <li><a href="https://trint.com/">Trint</a>: $70/month and up</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unhappy Rev customers are also <a href="https://www.coworker.org/petitions/support-from-customers-for-fair-wages-for-rev-com-workers">signing a petition</a> to ask Rev to raise wages.</p>
