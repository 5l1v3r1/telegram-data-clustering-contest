      <p>It has been revealed that the free-scoring frontman tore a thigh muscle while on Scotland duty.</p>
      <p>When their player pulled out of Steve Clarke’s squad after the game in Cyprus, the Tangerines originally stated that there was nothing to worry about because the injury was only “slight.”</p>
      <p>The hope was that he would be able to play against Morton a week tomorrow but manager Robbie Neilson has since revealed that Shankland will be sidelined for some time.</p>
      <p>Neilson said: “He had a wee thigh problem so we got it scanned a couple of days ago.</p>
      <p>“It looks like he’ll be out for the Morton game and we hope he’ll be back the following week.”</p>
