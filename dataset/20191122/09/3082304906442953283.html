        <b>Real Madrid star Eden Hazard has opened up on his slow start to life in the Spanish capital, admitting he arrived at the club overweight.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Eden Hazard has confessed he arrived at Real Madrid overweight and struggled to adapt in his first couple of months at the club.</p>
      <p>The Belgium international joined Madrid from Chelsea in a reported €100million deal in June, ending months of speculation over his future.</p>
      <p>Hazard’s competitive debut was delayed by several weeks due to a muscle injury sustained in pre-season and he did not get off the mark with his first goal until early October.</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger recently suggested Hazard’s weight gain was to blame for his slow start and the 28-year-old has now admitted as much.</p>

      <p>“It’s true,” Hazard told L’Equipe. “I’m not going to hide it. When I’m on vacation, I’m on vacation. I had put on five kilos, but I’m the type of person who can lose it quickly if I’m careful.</p>
      <p>“When I was 18 at Lille, I was 72 or 73 kilograms. My muscle mass was 75kg, on a bad day 77kg. I was 80kg this summer, but I lost it in 10 days.”</p>
      <p>Hazard, who has one goal and two assists in his first 11 appearances for Madrid, claimed his performances are improving over time.</p>
      <p>“I was not good enough,” he said of his start to life in the Spanish capital. “I told myself to start playing well.</p>
      <p>“The first two months were not good enough. I thought, ‘I can do better’. I’ve felt better for a month now – I dribble, accelerate and try to make others play better.</p>
      <p>“The first couple of months I reminded myself that I’m new and had to play simple. There were too many passes and people were waiting for me to dribble.”</p>
