      <h1>Spoilers: David kicks Jacob out in Emmerdale</h1>

      <p>He has been through a lot due to the grooming and abuse from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/maya-stepney/">Maya Stepney</a> (Louisa Clein) but <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacob-gallagher/">Jacob Gallagher</a>’s (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/joe-warren-plant/">Joe-Warren Plant</a>) recent behaviour is set to push David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfended) and Leyla Harding (Roxy Shahidi) to take drastic action in Emmerdale tonight.</p>
      <p>In the wake of Jacob’s aggressive behaviour and his heartless and cruel treatment of Leanna Cavanagh (Mimi Slinger), everyone is turning their backs on him including mates like Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele).</p>
      <p>Jacob disgusted everyone, including fans, by expressing a callous attitude to sex and claiming that he didn’t want Leanna but she was asking for it. Liam (Jonny McPherson) was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/emmerdale-spoilers-dr-liam-cavanagh-is-arrested-as-he-punches-jacob-gallagher-11197177/">infuriated by the way that Jacob was talking about his daughter and snapped before punching him.</a></p>
      <p>And after his actions got Liam arrested and put his job at risk, Leanna can’t bear to look at Jacob. When Jacob arrives back at the shop, David and Leyla are cold with him and an angry Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell) gives him a piece of his mind, telling him he can’t keep behaving this way to people.</p>

      <p>Jacob hits back defiantly but he doesn’t expect what is coming next when David and Leyla tell him that enough is enough – they want him out.</p>
      <p>As the consequences of his actions hit Jacob, his stomach jolts as he realises he is being kicked out. Will this provide him with a wake up call or is he set to be out on his ear?</p>
      <p>It was recently revealed that his abuser <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/emmerdale-spoilers-paedophile-maya-stepney-pregnant-jacob-gallaghers-baby-11184198/">Maya had been released and she is pregnant</a> – although there is no confirmation on who the father of her child is as she had sexual relationships with both David and Jacob.</p>
      <p>Emmerdale went on to confirm that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/emmerdale-spoilers-no-return-planned-for-maya-stepney-amid-pregnancy-twist-11184975/">there are no current plans for Maya to return.</a></p>
