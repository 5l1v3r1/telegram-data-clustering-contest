      <p>LINGERIE BRAND VICTORIA’S Secret is cancelling its annual fashion show, after recent poor television ratings and criticism of the show as sexist and outdated.</p>
      <p>The show first started in 1995 and has featured the world’s top supermodels such as Heidi Klum and Miranda Kerr, drawing millions of viewers at its height.</p>
      <p>However, the brand’s owners L Brands have said it’s time to “evolve” its marketing strategy in an earnings call with investors this week, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50512414">BBC has reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“We’re figuring out how to advance the positioning of the brand and best communicate that to customers,” its chief financial officer Stuart Durgdoerfer.</p>
      <p>L Brands has been hit with poor sales over the past few years, recording a net loss of $252 million in the last quarter.</p>
      <p>The Victoria’s Secret brand has also faced criticism in recent years for the annual show, provoking ire in the US for its use of slender models at a time when rival lingerie brands are becoming increasingly diverse and promoting all shapes and sizes.  </p>
      <p>Its marketing director Ed Razek provoked uproar on social media last year for telling Vogue that there was no need for transgender or plus-size models in the annual fashion show.</p>
      <p>“No, I don’t think we should. Well, why not? Because the show is a fantasy. It’s a 42-minute entertainment special,” he said.</p>
      <p>Heidi Zak, co-CEO of one such rival brand, ThirdLove, published an open letter in The New York Times saying she was “appalled” by Razek’s “demeaning comments.”</p>
      <p>“You market to men, and sell a male fantasy to women,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Women wear bras in real life as they go to work, breastfeed their children, play sports, care for ailing parents and serve their country,” she wrote.</p>
      <p>“Haven’t we moved beyond outdated ideas of femininity and gender roles? It’s time to stop telling women what makes them sexy — let us decide.”</p>
      <p>The company has also faced criticism for its billionaire founder Les Wexner’s friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. Wexner has said he cut ties with the disgraced financier back in 2007.</p>
