      <h1>Fashion Council calls for fresh start</h1>

      <p>FASHION Council WA says it is time for a “fresh start” after Perth Fashion Festival put itself into administration while reportedly owing close to $1 million to creditors.</p>
      <p>About 104 creditors and suppliers to WA’s premier fashion event are still owed $819,000 in unpaid invoices.</p>
      <p>Administrator Hall Chadwick was called in this week to assess the financial position of Perth Fashion Festival Pty Ltd after company directors Mariella Harvey-Hanrahan and Tony Sage placed PFF into voluntary administration.</p>
      <p>“As joint directors of the Perth Fashion Festival Pty Ltd, we have been trying to secure a repayment agreement with all PFF creditors for some time,” they said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, this has not been achievable as a small number of creditors were not prepared to enter into a payment agreement and funds that are owed to PFF by a major debtor have, as yet, not been received.”</p>

      <p>FCWA responded with a statement, saying the council was disappointed that Perth Fashion Festival Pty Ltd has put itself into administration and understands the consequences this will have for suppliers the company owes money to.</p>
      <p>“In the council’s view, it is now time for a fresh start,” FCWA said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Going forward, FCWA will operate independently of Perth Fashion Festival Pty Ltd. FCWA will not be using the PFF or Swim + Resort brands.</p>
      <p>“FCWA recognises the importance of major events for designers and creatives and the WA fashion industry.</p>
      <p>“Industry consultation will now take place to determine exactly what designers, retailers and other fashion stakeholders want from future FCWA run events.”</p>
