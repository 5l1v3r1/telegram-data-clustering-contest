      <p><b>GRAND JUNCTION, Colo.</b> - A Colorado school system <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/virus-colorado-schools-close.html?searchResultPosition=1">shuttered nearly four dozen schools</a> Thursday amid a suspected norovirus outbreak that has <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colorado-school-district-shuts-down-amid-possible-norovirus-outbreak-2019-11-21/">sickened hundreds</a> of students, teachers and staff in the past week.</p>

      <p>The unprecedented step of closing the entire Mesa County Valley School District 51 was taken while district officials work feverishly to eradicate the highly-contagious stomach bug, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colorado-school-district-shuts-down-amid-possible-norovirus-outbreak-2019-11-21/">CBS News</a> reported.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.d51schools.org/news/what_s_new/all_district_51_schools_closed_nov__21-22?fbclid=IwAR0mpfESWYkzYvMxXfduKvUQ9zmjIZ5bEykZc5BCm5u5-7rbuhaBfq7UqRk">In a statement issued Wednesday</a>, Tanya Marvin, the school system’s nursing coordinator, said the “highly unusual action” is being taken because of the outbreak’s rapid spread among the district’s roughly 22,000 students. </p>
      <p>“In addition, it appears that there is now a second, related virus that is affecting students, some of whom have already been ill in recent weeks. The combination of the two has created an unprecedented spread of illness,” Marvin said <a href="https://www.d51schools.org/news/what_s_new/all_district_51_schools_closed_nov__21-22?fbclid=IwAR0mpfESWYkzYvMxXfduKvUQ9zmjIZ5bEykZc5BCm5u5-7rbuhaBfq7UqRk">in the statement</a>.</p>
      <p>Although public health officials have not identified the illness officially as a norovirus, Jeff Kuhr, the executive director of Mesa County Public Health, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/virus-colorado-schools-close.html?searchResultPosition=1">The New York Times</a>, reported symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea usually lasting between 12 and 24 hours are consistent with that diagnosis.</p>
      <p>In addition, district spokeswoman Emily Shockley <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/virus-colorado-schools-close.html?searchResultPosition=1">told the Times</a> that every school that reported more than a 10 percent absentee rate prior to the announced closure ha been wiped down, bleached and sprayed with disinfectant. </p>
      <p>Students are expected to return to school following the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
