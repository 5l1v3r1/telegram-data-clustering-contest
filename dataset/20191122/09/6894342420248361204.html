      <h1>Resident Evil 3 Remake May Be In The Works</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:07:14+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/ian/" target="_blank">Ian Chee</a></address>
      <p>Capcom previously said that it will be <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/196984/capcom-bring-back-dormant-ips/">bringing back older titles</a> following the success of Resident Evil 2 Remake (RE2R) and Devil May Cry 5. It looks like the candidate the company has in mind is another Resident Evil title. Specifically, rumours indicate that Capcom has Resident Evil 3 Remake in the works.</p>
      <p>YouTube channel Spawn Wave first broke the rumour, which was then corroborated by sources to Video Games Chronicle. It will likely be able to reuse assets, mechanics and egnine from RE2R. For now it’s still unclear if, or when, Capcom intends to announce the title. As for its release, it’s also rumoured to be out in 2020, without any exact date or general window.</p>

      <p>If these rumours are true, then it’s likely that Capcom is leveraging the success of RE2R. With the game being a fair number of nominations for The Game Awards 2019, it’s not surprising that the company wants to repeat the strategy for next year.</p>
      <p>At any rate, The Game Awards 2019 is the next big gaming event that’s coming up. If the rumours are true and Capcom intends to announce the game within the year, that sounds like when we will be likely to hear more about Resident Evil 3 Remake.</p>
