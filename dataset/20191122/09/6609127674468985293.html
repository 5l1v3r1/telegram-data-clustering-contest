      <p>She was seen in the area of Strathdon Place in Broughty Ferry, walking in the direction of Dawson Road.</p>
      <p>Police say they are “concerned” for her as she was wearing a jumper described as not being appropriate for the cold weather.</p>
      <p>And they have now made an appeal to the public in a bid to find her.</p>
      <p>Inspector Ahmad said: “We are concerned for the female as she was described as approximately 70 to 80 years old, frail, and wearing a light purple jumper which was not appropriate for the weather conditions.</p>
      <p>“If anyone saw the female at the time, or knows who she is, please contact Police quoting incident 3914-on November 21, 2019.”</p>
      <p>We told yesterday how <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4979371/midlothian-school-brothers-missing-search/">a desperate search was launched</a> for two young brothers who disappeared after being dropped off at school in Midlothian.</p>
      <p>But Michael O'Brien, 9, and brother Jamie, 6, were traced safe and well.</p>
      <p>And police also <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4978674/pensioner-missing-thomas-mckie-newton-stewart-car-found/">traced a pensioner who went missing</a> in Dumfries and Galloway.</p>
      <p>Thomas McKie, 71, had disappeared from Newton Stewart.</p>
      <p>But cops later confirmed that he was found safe and well.</p>
