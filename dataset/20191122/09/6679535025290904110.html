      <h2>As per the government’s estimate, the Indian Railways require about ₹50 lakh crore in the next 12 years.</h2>

      <p>The government does not plan to privatise the Railways, but will outsource the commercial and on-board services of a few trains to improve service delivery, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal informed Parliament.</p>
      <p>Answering a question whether the government had planned to privatise railway operations in phases, including platform maintenance, he said, “No, sir. There is no proposal to privatise the operations.” But there was a proposal to outsource the commercial and on-board services of a few trains and to permit private players to induct modern rakes to run trains on select routes so as to improve services, he said.</p>
      <p>“The responsibility of train operations and safety certification rests with the Railways,” Mr. Goyal said, adding, that outsourcing of certain services — such as station cleaning, pay and use toilets, retiring rooms, parking and platforms maintenance — was being done based on needs to improve cleanliness.</p>
      <p>The Ministry constituted an empowered group of secretaries in October to work out a road map for the development of 50 stations and handing over the operation of 150 trains to private operators. </p>
      <p>The move followed NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant’s letter to Railway Board Chairman V.K. Yadav recommended that a committee be set up to “drive the process in a time-bound manner”. </p>
