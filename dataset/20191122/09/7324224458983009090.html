      <p>Striker Famara Diedhiou returns to the Bristol City squad ahead of their Sky Bet Championship clash with Nottingham Forest at Ashton Gate.</p>
      <p>Diedhiou is available after serving a three-match ban following his straight red card in the 2-1 victory at home to Charlton on October 23, in which he scored the equalising goal.</p>
      <p>Defensive midfielder Korey Smith is close to a comeback after seven months out recovering from a broken bone in his foot and ligament damage, while full-back Jack Hunt is poised to return from a hamstring problem.</p>
      <p>Defender Jay DaSilva and striker Benik Afobe remain sidelined as they fight their way back to full fitness from fracturing a tibia and anterior cruciate ligament injuries respectively.</p>
      <p>Forest head coach Sabri Lamouchi expects to have experienced defender Michael Dawson available for the trip to Ashton Gate.</p>
      <p>Dawson has been sidelined with a calf injury since the end of September but is set to return to the squad.</p>
      <p>Carl Jenkinson is also close to a comeback following an ankle injury which has kept him out since the end of August.</p>
      <p>Yohan Benalouane and Alfa Semedo have returned to training following hip and back problems respectively but Saturdayâ€™s game has come too soon for the pair.</p>
