      </p>
      <p>Sure, the holidays are drawing near too, but this infamous day of discounts is a whole event in itself.</p>
      <p>As we wait to hear of more offers in store for us in 2019, here’s what you need to know about what time <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/black-friday-2019-uk-deals-start-11066225/">Black Friday starts</a> and when it will be this year.</p>
      <h3>What time does Black Friday 2019 begin?</h3>
      <p>Many retailers have already started offering Black Friday sales, with the likes of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/sky-black-friday-deals-existing-customers-11193344/">Sky</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/early-black-friday-deals-now-tv-2019-11188384/">NOW TV</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/amazon-black-friday-deals-live-as-echo-kindle-and-alexa-gadgets-get-discounts-11195617/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/currys-carphone-warehouse-black-friday-deals-2019-11162655/">Currys, Carphone Warehouse</a> and more cutting prices on products in the run-up to the notorious shopping day.</p>

      <p>Some deals will also begin to be offered online from the second the clock strikes midnight on Friday morning.</p>

      <p>The tradition of offering discounts on Black Friday originated in America, and it always falls on the Friday after Thanksgiving.</p>

      <p>Another day of deals coming soon is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/26/what-is-cyber-monday-8178519/">Cyber Monday</a>, which falls the Monday after Black Friday and will be on 2 December this year.</p>
      <p>Cyber Monday does what it says on the tin in that the deals offered that day are only available online rather than the high street, so you won’t have to wade through crowds of people to bag a bargain.</p>
