      <p>Alison Barnes joined her local Slimming World group with her mum two and half years ago and dropped from 17st 10.5lb to 11st 3lb.</p>
      <p>Now she’s trained as a consultant for Slimming World, the UK’s largest group-based weight loss organisation, at its national training academy in Derbyshire. Members at the group are getting ready to welcome Alison as their new consultant when she takes over on Thursday 21st November 2019.</p>
      <p>She says: “When I first joined Slimming World as a member, I never dreamed I would end up helping other people to lose weight but now I just can’t wait to get started.</p>
      <p>“After losing six and half stone and completing my training, it’s a privilege for me to be able to pass on the experience, insight and understanding that helped me, so that I can give my members the support they need to get to target.</p>
      <p>“Support is really the most important thing. It all starts with feeling that you’re not alone. I couldn’t have lost six and half stone without the weekly help, encouragement and understanding of my own consultant and group.</p>
      <p>“As someone who has lost weight myself, I know the challenges people can face, which is why, along with the group, I will be there to support every one of my members all the way to their chosen target weight. Setting targets, sharing recipes and working together as a group to overcome challenges. That’s why, at my Slimming World group, there’ll be tons of support, encouragement and fun.</p>
      <p>“Like a lot of slimmer’s, I had tried to lose weight so many times before by following numerous diets but they were never sustainable because I’d always get tired of restricting what I ate. I felt miserable, unhappy and thought I was destined to struggle with my weight for the rest of my life, but when I joined Slimming World it was different.</p>
      <p>“I never felt like I was on a diet. The eating plan encourages you to eat lots of tasty, filling foods such as pasta, rice, potatoes and lean meat and fish, you are never hungry and no foods are banned so there’s no deprivation. I couldn’t believe I’d found a way to lose weight without starving myself.</p>
      <p>“Slimming World isn’t just about changing what you eat. Becoming more active is important too. Our Body Magic programme takes the threat out of activity by showing people how they can build activities into their daily routine without having to take up traditional forms of exercise. I love gardening and walking to get my Body Magic.”</p>
      <p>Like Alison, Slimming World consultants are all former members who have lost weight themselves and groups are set up as micro businesses in the heart of local communities.</p>
      <p>Alison can’t wait for the new challenges running her own business will bring: “For me becoming a self-employed franchisee was a great option. I wanted a job that I loved doing and wanted to avoid a regular ‘nine-to-five’ routine, so launching my own Slimming World group was an ideal option – I feel like I’ve got a brand-new career and I can’t wait for my new groups to run now!”</p>
      <p>Debbie Dickson, who runs Slimming World’s Kinross group and manages Alison as a Team Developer, says: “Slimming World Consultants are chosen for their positive outlook and because they genuinely care about the health and happiness of others.</p>
      <p>“With Alison’s experience of being a successful Slimming World member and her kind and warm personality, I just know that she’ll be an amazing support to members, cheering them all the way to their target weight.”</p>
      <p>Alison’s Slimming World group will be held at Forth Street Hall, 6a Forth Street, Leven every Thursday at 5.30pm and 7.30pm from 21st November 2019.</p>
      <p>For more information or to join Alison’s group either pop along on 21st November or call her on 07874375901.</p>
