      <p>You do not even need specialist equipment. The most important to remember is to take comfortable clothes and avoid bright colours. Earthy hues are best – beige, brown and green. It can get chilly on the back of the safari vehicle, so layers are good.</p>
      <p><b>Binoculars.</b> ( Both for in your own vehicle or on the back of a game viewing vehicle) Roof prism binoculars are recommended because they are smaller, more compact, hardier and they let in more light. </p>

      <p><b>Sunscreen (even if it is winter).</b> Hats for the sun and beanies for winter mornings. This might be Africa, but the winter months are cold, even if the days are sunny. You are likely to get a sunburn even in the middle of winter.</p>

      <p><b>A good pair of trainers or hiking shoes. T</b>here is no need to pack bulky, heavy duty hiking boots. You might also like to pack a pair of sandals for around the lodge or pool.</p>

      <p><b>If you’re into birding, definitely download an app like <a href="http://www.robertsbirds.co.za/">Roberts Birds</a>, or take a birding book along, so you can tick off lots of new sightings. </b>Most guides have a solid knowledge of birds, so even if you aren’t into birding, it’s interesting when they stop and point out unique birds or behaviours.</p>

      <p><b>Lip balm. </b>Especially in winter, when the cold air will make them very dry.</p>
      <p><b>Swimsuit.</b> Even winter days can be surprisingly warm and almost all the lodges and camps have amazing swimming pools.</p>
