      <p>Humans have been on a “dizzying spending spree for centuries” with the planet’s resources and we are facing a “climate and biodiversity emergency”, the Prince of Wales said.</p>
      <p>Charles was addressing an audience at Lincoln University during his tour of New Zealand and said humanity was at “a tipping point” with only a small window left before the planet’s fate would be out of our hands.</p>
      <p>The prince also appeared to allude to the movement started by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, saying that children were “demanding immediate action and not just words”.</p>
      <p>Charles delivered a keynote address on environmental issues in which he said: “If we were to think about nature and her assets as humanity’s own bank account, it is clear that we have been on a dizzying spending spree for centuries.</p>
      <blockquote>For the past 40-50 years, I have been driven by an overwhelming desire not to be confronted by my grandchildren demanding to know why I didn’t do anything to prevent them being bequeathed a poisoned and destroyed planet<cite>Prince of Wales</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“We now find ourselves dangerously overdrawn and urgently need to figure out how we are going to repay the mounting debt.</p>
      <p>“And, if we were to think of this planet as a patient, any self-respecting doctor would long ago have made a precautionary intervention on the basis of the symptoms displayed.”</p>
      <p>The prince added that the world had to start acting in the interests of future generations.</p>
      <p>He said: “For the past 40-50 years, I have been driven by an overwhelming desire not to be confronted by my grandchildren demanding to know why I didn’t do anything to prevent them being bequeathed a poisoned and destroyed planet.</p>
      <p>“Now, of course, we are indeed being confronted by these very children, demanding immediate action and not just words. How much longer therefore can we dither and delay?</p>

      <p>“We have, I’m afraid, reached a defining moment in our human history, a tipping point, at which we still have the ability to change course, but really only in the next 10 years, so a very small window, after which there may be no going back.”</p>
