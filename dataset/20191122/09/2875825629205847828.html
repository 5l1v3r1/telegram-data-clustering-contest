      <p>The pop star, 45, battled booze and drugs for years, before finally admitting his troublesome addictions and getting help at rehab.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/take-that-1">Take That</a> frontman has now revealed he has Elton to thank for getting him on the straight and narrow after one drunken night too many.</p>

      <p>He said: "When I was first getting sober, there was a week until I had to go to rehab and I had two vocals to do on my first album.</p>
      <p>"Elton invited me to his house to listen to the work."</p>
      <p>Robbie then admits a dangerous game he used to play, where he would "stop at every pub I saw and have half a pint."</p>

      <p>This risky drinking disaster led the Brit A-lister to have sunk "10 half pints" before getting to the studio.</p>
      <p>The Let Me Entertain You hitmaker says the Rocketman singer helped him turn his life around following this all-day bender.</p>
      <p>He adds: "I ended up under the mixing desk, had a bit of red wine then I had to get to Elton's.</p>
      <p>"It was a big moment being in Elton John’s kitchen...thinking ‘How am I going to get myself out of this mess?’"</p>

      <p>Robbie said Elton insisted he went to rehab straight away, but Robbie refused and told the pop icon he was going the following week.</p>
      <p>However, according to Robbie, Elton refused to take no for an answer and forced the drunk star to stay at his house in Windsor and set up arrangements for rehab.</p>
      <p>Robbie describes: "I wake up but I haven't opened my eyes and there's a knock on my shoulder and I look and there's Elton and David Furnish and a doctor and a psychiatrist and they are here to take me away."</p>
      <p>The singer - who has children Teddy, seven, Charlie, five, and Coco, 14 months, with wife <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ayda-field">Ayda Field</a> , 40 - infamously checked into rehab in 2007 after taking speed, acid, heroin, cocaine and 'heart-stopping' amounts of prescription drugs.</p>

      <p>The Take That sensation has now been successfully sober for many years.</p>
      <p>However, in a 2016 interview the father-of-three said drugs still played on his mind, saying he would still “think about ecstasy”.</p>
      <p>Robbie has a busy month coming up with the release of his Christmas album 'The Christmas Present', featuring an unusual collaboration with boxer <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> .</p>
