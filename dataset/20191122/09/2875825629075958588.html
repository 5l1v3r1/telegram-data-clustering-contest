      <h2>Troubled pop star Aaron Carter say he's having to move house to get away from obsessed fans who turn up on his doorstep</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:33:42+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:33</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/aaron-carter">Aaron Carter</a> has declared he's being forced to sell off his £450,000 mansion because he's being hounded by Backstreet Boys fans.</p>
      <p>The troubled pop star, 31, who is the younger brother of BSB star Nick Carter, has shared CCTV footage from his home in California showing strangers lurking outside his house.</p>
      <p>The black and white film shows two young women standing on his front drive taking pictrues.</p>
      <p>One of the pair turns to the camera to blow a kiss before walking away.</p>
      <p>Aaron tweeted: "I’m being stalked by BSB gang stalkers and this is why I have to move."</p>
      <p>The former child star has been living in the house for less than a year after buying it in 2018 for around £332,000.</p>

      <p>It's now on the market for around £463,000, which would net Aaron a healthy profit.</p>
      <p>The house boasts three bedrooms, three bathrooms and a stunning pool in the back yard.</p>
      <p>The move comes at a particularly turbulent time for Aaron as his long-running feud with his pop star brother Nick has gone to court.</p>
      <p>A judge has granted a restraining order to keep Aaron away from Nick amid allegations he had threatened to kill Nick's pregnant wife.</p>

      <p>Aaron has also been banned from contacting his twin sister Angel and ordered to hand his guns to authorities following claims he threatened her with violence and showed off his weapons on social media.</p>
      <p>TMZ.com reported Aaron screamed at the judge in court over the ruling.</p>
      <p>After careful consideration, my sister Angel and I regret that we were required to seek a restraining order against our brother Aaron today.</p>
      <p>Nick previously explained the legal wraingling in a statememt, saying: "In light of Aaron's increasingly alarming behaviour and his recent confessions that he harbours thoughts and intentions of killing my pregnant wife and unborn child, we were left with no choice but to take every measure possible to protect ourselves and our family."</p>
