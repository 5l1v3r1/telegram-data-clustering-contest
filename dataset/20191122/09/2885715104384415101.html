      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:15:44+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/maulshree-seth/" target="_blank">Maulshree Seth</a></address>
      <p>The disciplinary committee of the state Congress unit on Thursday served show-cause notice to 11 senior Congress leaders, including octogenarian Ram Krishna Dwivedi, who was the former chairman of the disciplinary committee on charges of unnecessary holding a meeting against the decision of All India Congress Committee.</p>
      <p>These leaders had recently held a meeting in Lucknow at the residence of former MP and AICC member Santosh Singh where they had discussed how leaders, especially those above 60 years, were being sidelined, whereas those who have recently joined the party were being given organisational responsibilities.</p>
      <p>The notice was served by former MLA from Varanasi and member of Uttar Pradesh Congress Disciplinary Committee, Ajay Rai.</p>
      <p>A section of senior leaders had decided to seek time from Congress president <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sonia-gandhi">Sonia Gandhi</a> to express their concerns over the changes made in the state unit organisation and also hold a “sammelan” of such leaders from all across the state in Noida.</p>
      <p>The state unit of the Congress was revamped last month with young leaders in the age group of 40 to 45 years being given responsibilities. The central party leadership had also chosen a rather young and grassroots leader Ajay Kumar Lallu, an MLA from Kushinagar, as the new president of the state unit. However, since then, senior leaders, most of whom were made members of the advisory committee to AICC general secretary <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/priyanka-gandhi/">Priyanka Gandhi</a> Vadra had been complaining of being completely sidelined in the new scheme.</p>
      <p>In order to give it a collective voice, some of the veteran leaders, who have also been office bearers at different intervals had held a meeting in Lucknow earlier this month.</p>
      <p>“Disciplinary Committee of Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee has taken cognizance of the reports, which talked about how you all have been holding unnecessary meetings without any reason to oppose the decisions taken by All India Congress Committee (AICC). Such meetings and statements in media have affected the image of the party,” read the notice served to the veteran leaders on Thursday.</p>
      <p>It further read, “Such a thing is not expected from senior leaders like you and such behaviour of yours is against the policies of the party and its decisions. This act of yours comes under the indiscipline.”</p>
      <p>These leaders have been given just 24 hours to reply to the notices that why a disciplinary action be not taken against them.</p>
      <p>“These leaders have been served notice and have been asked to give their explanation within next 24 hours to a member of disciplinary committee Ajay Rai for indiscipline on the directions of AICC general secretary incharge Priyanka Gandhi and Congress state president Ajay Kumar Lallu,” said Rajiv Tyagi, media in-charge of Congress.</p>
      <p>The leaders, who have been served notice include Santosh Singh former MP and member of AICC, Siraj Mehndi, former MLC and member of Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee, Ram Krishna Dwivedi, former Home Minister in UP and former chairman of UPCC disciplinary committee, Satyadev Tripathi, former Minister and former chief of UPCC communication department, Rajendra Singh Solanki, member UPCC. Former MLAs, including BN Mishra, Hafiz Mohd, Vinod Chaudhary, Nek Chandra Pandey. As well as former president of Youth Congress SP Goswami and former district chief of Gorakhpur unit Sanjeev Singh.</p>
      <p>Asked about the notice, one of the veteran leaders, Vinod Chaudhary, who have been served “otice said, “Ideally, we should have been served notice first before making it public. We are Congressmen and would remain so all our lives, and all we wanted was to strengthen the party. Sonia Gandhi is our leader and would remain so. But we are shocked and surprised by such a narrow mindset and would soon decide our future line of action.”</p>
      <p>Veteran leader Ram Krishna Dwivedi said, “I fail to understand that what is wrong in thinking about strengthening the party or deciding, to take up the issues with our leader, Sonia Gandhi. There are leaders, who have worked with <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/indira-gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a> as well and would remain Congressmen all their life. But if such a step is taken it is unfortunate.”</p>
