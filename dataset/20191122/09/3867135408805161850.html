      <p>SPOKANE â€” Amazon founder Jeff Bezos will donate $5 million to help create housing for homeless families in Spokane.</p>
      <p>The Spokesman-Review says Bezos will donate the money to Catholic Charities of Eastern Washington. The money comes from the Bezos Day One Families Fund.</p>
      <p>Most of it is destined for the planned Gonzaga Family Haven complex in northeast Spokane, which is intended to provide housing and social services for more than 70 families.</p>
      <p>The project is a partnership among Catholic Charities, Gonzaga University and Gonzaga Prep High School, which is located next to the planned complex.</p>
      <p>Officials say the grant is not enough to fund the entire project, but it will allow better services than originally planned.</p>
      <p>Spokane is grappling with major homelessness issues, especially in the downtown core.</p>
