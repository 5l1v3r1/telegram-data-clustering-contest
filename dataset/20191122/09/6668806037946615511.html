      <p>Manish Malhotra is one of the very few designers who the celebrities trust blindly when it comes to their outfits. The designer recently lost his father, late Suraj Malhotra, who was in his early nineties and had been ill for a while. Ever since the news broke out, several celebrities started flooding the designer’s residence to offer condolences and even attended the prayer meet held a few days back. </p>
      <p>Last night, we spotted Manish’s close friend and global icon Priyanka Chopra at his residence who came in to check up on him and offer condolences. Dharma Productions’ spearhead Karan Johar was also spotted at the designer’s house last night. Check out the pictures below. </p>
