      <p>STOCKHOLM - <b>ASSA ABLOY Global Solutions</b> has announced the successful implementation of its advanced security access platforms at the <b>Courtyard Bucharest Floreasca</b>. A recently opened hotel located within the business area of Bucharest, Courtyard Bucharest Floreasca is able to provide each guest with both seamless and secure access to their guestrooms using <b>VingCard Signature RFID</b> and <b>VingCard Flex </b>door locks equipped with <b>Mobile Access</b> functionality. <b>Courtyard Bucharest Floreasca</b> has also further ensured a secure and convenient environment throughout the property with the inclusion of panic bars, door retainers and <b>Elsafe Zenith </b>Electronic safes.</p>
      <p>By implementing VingCard RFID locks, Courtyard Bucharest Floreasca was able to ensure guest safety through advanced data encryption protocols while adhering to hotel brand requirements for providing guests with digital key access abilities. As more guests come to expect the instant convenience that digital key functionality provides and as more hotel brands mandate the technology's availability as a result, VingCard's Mobile Access compatibility ensures that properties are able to activate the feature at any moment without the need for additional hardware purchases. Guests now staying at the Courtyard Bucharest Floreasca can use personal devices as a convenient digital key that instantly allows them to access their guestroom, sidestepping the need to first wait in front desk lines and providing them with the ability to immediately begin enjoying their hotel stay experience.</p>
      <p>"Guest expectations are rising each year as they become more familiar with the benefits that new technology provides, and it is therefore critical to work with a reputable provider that has the abilities and expertise needed for hoteliers to keep pace with the latest demands," says <b>Adrian Adam</b>, General Manager at Courtyard Bucharest Floreasca. "<i>ASSA ABLOY Global Solutions stands apart in this regard, with innovations such as Mobile Access that provide guests with an ability to personalize their experience in a way that fits their growing expectation for instant service. Yet at the same time, we remain committed to our priority of keeping guests safe at all times and ASSA ABLOY Global Solutions is simultaneously able to maximize security and convenience throughout our property with its advanced platforms.</i>"</p>
      <p>While recognized for its convenience-enhancing abilities, Mobile Access utilizes the latest in data encryption to ensure that only authorized users can ever gain room access. Leveraging ASSA ABLOY's Seos technology, Mobile Access first encrypts digital key and room number information before being transmitted to guest devices using a secure communications channel. Once present on a guest device, the information is then stored inside a digital vault within the hotel's mobile app. When a guest presents their device to the appropriate door lock, digital key data is again transmitted using a secure communication channel to prevent any risk of data theft.</p>
      <p>With the additional implementation of panic bars and door retainers, ASSA ABLOY Global Solutions has also further enhanced security throughout Courtyard Bucharest Floreasca while providing guests with a seamless means of escape should an emergency arise. With Elsafe Zenith safes included in each guestroom, those staying at the property can also securely store personal belongings using a solution equipped with the latest in anti-tamper technology.</p>
