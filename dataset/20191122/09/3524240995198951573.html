      <p>The Nigeria Police Force in Ondo State have called on the public to give useful information to the command that could lead to the rescue of a one-year-old boy, Kolawole Gold, who went missing in a church in Akure.</p>
      <p>Mr Femi Joseph, the Police Public Relations Officer made the call in a statement on Thursday in Akure.</p>
      <p>“The Ondo State Police Command wishes to inform the general public, especially the good people of Ondo State, about the sudden and unfortunate disappearance of a little boy by name Kolawole Gold.</p>
      <p>“Gold was last seen in a church programme holding at Sotitobire Church, Oshinle Quarters Akure with his parents, Mr and Mrs Kolawole, on November 10 at around 11.30 a.m.</p>
      <p>“The boy, who is one-year-old and light-skinned, can speak and understand Yoruba and English languages,’’ Joseph stated.</p>
      <p>According to the PPRO, the command has since launched an investigation into the incident.</p>
