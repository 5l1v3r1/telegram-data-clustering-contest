      <h1>Inverness illness won’t be factor in Dundee’s Highland trip, says boss James McPake</h1>
      <h2>Dundee manager James McPake does not think the virus that has hit Inverness Caley Thistle will have an impact on their match.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/ianroache/" target="_blank">Ian Roache</a></address>
      <p>The Dark Blues head to the Highlands tomorrow for a crucial third versus fourth encounter with ICT, who have been laid low by illness.</p>
      <p>Boss John Robertson and his assistant Scott Kellacher both missed their side’s Tunnock’s Caramel Wafer Cup penalty shootout win over Clyde last Saturday because of the bug.</p>
      <p>However, McPake is continuing to plan for the Championship clash as if every player will be available for the opposition.</p>
      <p>The Dens gaffer said: “I was unaware of that until today and obviously I’m not sure how serious it actually is.</p>
      <p>“But it’s irrelevant.</p>
      <p>“You hear about this and then you go up and find that the team comes flying out the blocks, and they look all right after all.</p>
      <p>“We are not looking into it at all.</p>
      <p>“It is all about us and what we do.</p>
      <p>“It is always a tough game up there because they are a decent side.</p>
      <p>“We have already had two real tough games against them at Dens this season (a 1-0 win in the Betfred Cup 1-0 in July  and goalless draw in the league in August).</p>
      <p>“I thought we were much better as a team in the Betfred game here.</p>
      <p>“Then, in the league match that followed, I thought they edged it and were the better side in that 0-0 draw.”</p>
      <p>McPake stressed that it is difficult to tell which ICT team will show up.</p>
      <p>He added: “On the two occasions they have been here this season, two different Inverness teams have turned up.</p>
      <p>“They were very direct the first time and then the next time they came here and got the ball down and played.</p>
      <p>“So they have a lot of tools which can cause teams problems.</p>
      <p>“But it’s down to us to do what we’re capable of and hopefully we can go up there and get a positive result.”</p>
      <p>Dundee continue to get players fit and available, with Jamie Ness, Jordan Marshall and Josh Meekings all ready if required against ICT.</p>
      <p>McPake said: “We have a full squad barring the goalkeeper (Jack Hamilton), which is an illness opposed to an injury.</p>
      <p>“So that is good and we are as strong as we can be.</p>
      <p>“Having all the lads back to fitness, it gives me some good decisions to make.”</p>
      <p>The Dark Blues may be going into the match on the back of a disappointing derby defeat to league leaders Dundee United but they should be encouraged by some excellent away form.</p>
      <p>McPake said: “Our last two away games have brought good results against Ayr United and Alloa.</p>
      <p>“Inverness falls into exactly the same category as another tough away game and I think teams know what they’re going to get up there.</p>
      <p>“You need to roll the sleeves up and get into the game first and foremost.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Dundee are continuing their partnership with SSAFA (the Armed Forces charity) and the Black Watch Association.</p>
      <p>This connection will be represented by the team’s red third kit for this season.</p>
      <p>The shirt includes a special Black Watch badge, imprints of servicemen on the front and the Black Watch Castle in Perth on the lower back.</p>
      <p>The Latin motto Nemo Me Impune Lacessit (No One Provokes Me With Impunity) is also displayed at the top of the back of the shirt.</p>
      <p>SSAFA is the United Kingdom’s oldest military charity, which provides lifelong support those currently serving, veterans and their families at the time of need.</p>
      <p>It provides financial, practical and emotional support to the Armed Forces community through its network of volunteers across the UK, including the Dundee and Angus SSAFA branch.</p>
      <p>Dundee will wear the kit for the first time against Ayr United at Dens on January 11.</p>
