      <h1>Half-Life: Alyx is a slick-looking VR-based prequel coming March 2020</h1>
      <h2>'Wake up Ms Vance'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:48:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theinquirer.net/author/profile/3180/roland-moore-colyer" target="_blank">Roland Moore-Colyer</a></address>
      <p><b>WE WEREN'T EXPECTING</b> to see <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3084049/half-life-alyx">a <i>Half-Life</i> game announced the week</a>, or indeed ever, but Valve teased and then took the covers off <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i>.</p>
      <p>So that was surprising. The fact that its a virtual reality game isn't so mind-blowing <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3073423/valve-vr-headset-official">given Valve's work in VR</a>. But on Thursday, the company dropped a short trailer for <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i>, and surprised us once again, as the game is a prequel rather than a sequel to <i>Half-Life 2: Episode Two</i>.</p>
      <p>We weren't expecting <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> to basically be <i>Half-Life 3</i>, but we didn't expect it to go down the prequel route either.</p>
      <p>But it does, and we know that as takes place in City 17, which *spoiler alert* at the end of <i>Half-Life 2</i> and the start of <i>Half-Life 2: Episode One</i>, gets turned into Borksville after protagonist Gordon Freeman wrecks the city's Citadel's dark fusion reactor when trying to stop antagonist Dr Wallace Breen's attempt to teleport away from a citizen uprising.</p>
      <p>The trailer for <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> shows City 17 in working order and filled with alien nasties, like the irritating and rather disgusting Facehugger-like headcrabs and human-alien Combine forces.</p>
      <p>And in the city, Alyx appears to be on a mission to find some form of weapon to relieve the Combine's choke-hold over Cty 17 with the assistance of a clumsy, semi wise-cracking bloke from New Zealand (we think).</p>
      <p>All you get to see of Alyx is her hands though, as being a VR game the entire viewpoint is first-person, with Alyx's hands being controlled courtesy of motion-sensing controllers, such as those of <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3074902/valve-index-vr-official-uk">Valve's own Index VR</a> set or <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3071531/htc-unveils-the-vive-focus-plus">the HTC Vive</a> and <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3072925/oculus-rift-s-official">Oculus Rift</a>.</p>
      <p>Alyx's hands come clad in the "Gravity Gloves", which like <i>Half-Life 2</i>'s Gravity Gun allow for objects to be pulled towards Alyx or blasted away from here, allowing for all manner of physics-based combat, puzzle-solving and foolery.</p>
      <p>The game looks to be a neat blend of movement-tracking VR shooting and problem-solving by interacting with the environment around you.</p>
      <p>This harks back to <i>Half-Life 2</i>, but it's likely to be a lot more immersive this time around, especially as everything is rendered in the Source 2 engine and looks pretty damn good, with hefty dollops of the dank and lived-in world of <i>Half-Life 2</i> but with a modern graphical paint job.</p>
      <p>"Half-Life: Alyx was designed from the ground up for virtual reality and features all of the hallmarks of a classic Half-Life game: world exploration, puzzle-solving, visceral combat, and an intricately woven story that connects it all with the characters iconic to the Half-Life universe," Valve said.</p>
      <p>We won't bleat on anymore about what's in the trailer as you'll want to see that for yourself; just watch to the end for a neat fan-serving surprise.</p>

      <p>While <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> isn't likely to be the game <i>Half-Life</i> fans have been waiting for, Valve suggested that if it's well-received, the game giant could crank out some more high-fidelity VR games. And the work it's doing in VR should equip other developers with the tools and inspiration to see what they can do in VR using the Source 2 engine.</p>
      <p>Steam Workshop support is also set to come with the game, which will allow people with the technical skills to create mods for the game; such modes in the past have resulted in full-fledged games, so this could be a step towards creating a richer vein of VR games.</p>
      <p><i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> is set to arrive March 2020 and will be supported by a suite of major VR headsets compatible with the SteamVR platform. Those who buy an Index headset can get the game for free, but that bit of VR kit ain't cheap.</p>
      <p>You'll not only need a VR headset but also a PC with a decent spec to run the game. Minimum specs demand a machine with a quad-core Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 1600 CPU or better, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 or Radeon RX 580 or better sporting 6GB of video memory, and 12GB of system RAM.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Three remains the magic number</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> will be with us reasonably soon, so where does that leave <i>Half-Life 3</i>? Well still in limbo by all accounts.</p>
      <p>The Game Awards' Geoff Keighley spoke to Valve developers David Speyrer, Dario Casali and Robin Walker to understand why Valve went with a VR <i>Half-Life</i> game and not a game that resolves the cliffhanger of <i>Half-Life: Episode 2</i>.</p>
      <p>"In all honesty, back in 2016 when we started this, Half-Life 3 was a terrifyingly daunting prospect," Walker explained. "I think to some extent, VR was a way we could fool ourselves into believing we had a way to do this. By starting with VR and then trying to think about Half-Life and how that worked with it, and playtesting those, you're immediately in a space where we have something we understand well: Half-Life's core gameplay."</p>

      <p>With <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i>, Valve set out to make a VR game, not a <i>Half-Life</i> game; that simply ended up happening.</p>
      <p>Walker noted that is was "really easy" to effectively not think about making <i>Half-Life 3</i> and focus on what people enjoyed the games and how the developers can "make forward progress".</p>
      <p>"In some ways, VR was a little bit like the way the gravity gun helped us in <i>Half-Life 2</i> where it just became the tentpole where you could wrap so much around," Walker said. "VR became this thing we could wrap everything around."</p>
      <p>"Whereas <i>Half-Life 3</i>, if tomorrow they're like, hey you're working on <i>Half-Life 3</i>, it's like, ‘Ohhh god.' Terrifying!"</p>
      <p>Aside from that, there was no mention of <i>Half-Life 3</i>, which means it remains consigned to the fevered dreams of <i>Half-Life</i> fans.</p>
      <p>That might be a good thing, as while Valve pretty much struck gold on all the <i>Half-Life</i> games, first-person shooters have evolved a lot, arguably beyond the spectre of the <i>Half-Life</i> games. So Valve would need to pull out something very special for a more traditional <i>Half-Life</i> game to have the same impact as its predecessors, which could be one heck of an ask.</p>
      <p>However, the fact that there is a new <i>Half-Life</i> game is promising, and that might mean there's still a glimmer of hope that a groundbreaking third chapter in the <i>Half-Life</i> story could be revealed. Just don't hold your breath. µ</p>
