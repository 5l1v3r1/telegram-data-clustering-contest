        <b>Miguna, Raila Jnr in brutal war of words</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kenyans on Twitter were on Friday treated to a brutal of words pitting exiled Kenyan lawyer Miguna Miguna and the son of ODM Leader Raila Odinga - Raila Odinga Junior.</p>
      <p>Trouble started after Miguna responded to an old tweet where Junior opined that Nairobi city should not have been a county but a Metropolis.</p>
      <p>"<i>Now in my opinion NAIROBI should never have been a County but rather it should be a Metropolis and Lavington-Kileleshwa, Westlands Langata, Eastleigh, Dagoreti N/S among others should be different boroughs it’s about the best means of distributing services to the communities </i><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BBi?src=hashtag_click"><i>#BBi</i></a>," the young Odinga had tweeted two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>On Friday at around 1am in the morning, Miguna responded to the tweet - criticizing Junior and attacking his credibility.</p>
      <p>"<i>You are as confused as your con-man "father." Services are NOT distributed by changing the name from "county" to "borough." Your castrated, cowardly father used public money to take you to the USA for studies and you only returned with the word BOROUGH. Go to sleep. </i><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RejectBBI?src=hashtag_click"><i>#RejectBBI</i></a>," Miguna tweeted.</p>
      <p>The use of quotes was in line with Miguna's unproven allegation that Odinga had not sired his son Junior.</p>
      <p>The comment did not sit well with Junior who responded by correcting Miguna on where he had gone to school and appeared to make fun of Miguna's allegations about being sired by another man.</p>
      <p>"<i>I thought Joe Ager was my father, how did he sire me if he was castrated. I was actually asleep when you tweeted, well me being in Kenya and you in baridii lands. I went to school in Wales and I believe the MSc In finance I have differs from your assertions,</i>" Junior hit back.</p>
      <p>The younger Odinga went further to dismiss Miguna as technologically illiterate - claiming he had helped Miguna recover his Facebook after forgetting his password.</p>
      <p>"<i>Fact: Miguna pretends to be so intellectual, he couldn’t even log in to his Facebook account on his computer, we literally had to show him how to retrieve a password nonsense fellow Nkt Fuo ka chieth</i>," he tweeted.</p>
      <p>Miguna dismissed Junior as a "spoilt brat".</p>
      <p>"<i>Those spoilt brats feel entitled like their con-men parents and they must be put in their places constantly. Last week it was Despot Kenyatta's functionally illiterate daughter trying to lecture the Kenyan youth about "empowerment" and now The Con-Man's "son" is vomiting on us</i>," the Canada-based activist stated.</p>
      <p>The war of words was still ongoing as at the time of publishing this story.</p>
