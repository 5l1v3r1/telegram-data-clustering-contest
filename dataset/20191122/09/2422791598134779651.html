      <p>VANCOUVER -- A pioneering study of seven belugas in Canada's remote Arctic waters has found microplastics in the innards of every single whale.</p>
      <p>Researchers from <a href="https://ocean.org/">Ocean Wise</a> worked with hunters from the Inuvialuit community of Tuktoyaktuk, N.W.T., to collect samples from whales they harvested between 2017 and 2018.</p>
      <p>They found an average of nearly 10 microplastics, or particles less than five millimetres in size, in the gastrointestinal tracts of each beluga.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025326X19308793">The study</a> was published last week in the Marine Pollution Bulletin and conducted in partnership with Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Simon Fraser University.</p>
      <p>Ocean Wise says it is the first study of microplastics in a marine mammal in Canada.</p>
      <p>Lead author Rhiannon Moore says she wasn't expecting to see so many microplastics so far north.</p>
      <p>"It actually surprised me at first. I thought, this is a far-north top predator in the Arctic in a fairly remote place," Moore says in an interview.</p>
      <p>It demonstrated just how far microplastics can travel and how they've penetrated even the most remote environments, she says.</p>
      <p>"It definitely tells us they're ubiquitous, they're ending up everywhere," she says. "It's a global problem, it's not a contained local problem, so it's going to take a lot of different actors -- government, industries and consumers -- to try to limit the flow."</p>
      <p>Nine different types of plastic polymers were identified in the animals, with polyester being the most common.</p>
      <p>While Moore says she believes they would have passed through the whales' digestive tracts without any immediate consequences, there's still very little known about the potential long-term health effects of prolonged exposure.</p>
      <p>It's also unknown how the microplastics entered the whales, but Moore says she thinks they most likely ate fish that had already ingested the plastic.</p>
      <p>Her next study will focus on microplastics in beluga prey.</p>
      <p>Moore says the community of about 900 people, who live on the shores of the Eastern Beaufort Sea north of the Arctic Circle, was a key partner in the project. The whales are an important source of nutrition and are closely monitored for contaminants.</p>
      <p>It gave the researchers the advantage of studying healthy specimens, compared with studies in other parts of the world that have looked at microplastics in whales found dead.</p>
      <p>"There have been some European studies on whales that have essentially washed up and that's another reason why this study is unique -- these whales, they didn't wash up on a beach so there's not really that bias where they're already sick or injured. They are a healthy population," Moore says.</p>
      <p>Moore says she suspects marine mammals closer to populated areas are likely to ingest even more microplastics than the Arctic belugas.</p>
      <p>"It does raise questions about what other whales might be exposed to," she says. "I definitely think about that, that's a question that keeps me up at night a little bit."</p>
