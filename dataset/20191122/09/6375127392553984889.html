      <h3>IN the Philippines, where many people still live below the so-called poverty line, the availability of cheap but quality medicines is a must for the survival of poor patients across the country.</h3>
      <p>Unfortunately, however, several pharmaceutical companies are reportedly blocking moves to bring down the prices of medicines, particularly the 120 drugs for common diseases.</p>
      <p>They include cancer, diabetes, heart disease and asthma, said Sen. Risa Hontiveros during last Tuesday’s plenary deliberation on the 2020 budget of the Department of Health (DoH).</p>
      <p>The said firms are reportedly against the proposed use of government’s regulatory powers under the Cheaper Medicines Act to lower the “unfair and anti-poor prices of medicines.”</p>
      <p>Hontiveros called on the health department to identify the said pharmaceutical companies and question them why they are opposing the initiatives to lower the prices of medicines.</p>
      <p>“Nananawagan ako sa DoH na pangalanan ang mga pharmaceutical company na mas inuuna pa ang kanilang malalaking tubo at kita kaysa sa buhay at kalusugan ng mamamayan,” she added.</p>
      <p>The lady senator lamented that the prices of medicines in this impoverished Southeast Asian country remain high and beyond the reach of majority of the Filipino.</p>
      <p>A study commissioned by the DoH showed that on average, the prices of medicines in impoverished Philippines are still significantly higher than the international reference prices.</p>
      <p>Bringing down the prices of medicines is one way of giving flesh to the pro-poor program of Duterte’s six-year presidency, which started in June 2016 and ends at 12 noon on June 30, 2022.</p>
      <p>Everybody ought to help unburden the Filipino people from the problem of expensive medicines.</p>
