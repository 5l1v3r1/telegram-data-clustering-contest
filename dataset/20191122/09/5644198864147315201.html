      <p>Canada's tennis revolution continued as they claimed their first Davis Cup victory over Australia to reach the semi-finals on Thursday with 150th-ranked Vasek Pospisil the hero once again.</p>
      <p>MADRID: Canada's tennis revolution continued as they claimed their first Davis Cup victory over Australia to reach the semi-finals on Thursday with 150th-ranked Vasek Pospisil the hero once again.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old recorded his third successive singles win in the revamped Finals at Madrid's La Caja Magica, beating John Millman 7-6(7) 6-4, but Alex De Minaur levelled the tie when he recovered from a set down to beat Denis Shapovalov.</p>

      <p>Pospisil and Shapovalov joined forces in the deciding doubles rubber against Jordan Thompson and John Peers, winning 6-4 6-4 in front of several hundred delirious Canadian fans.</p>
      <p>Canada will face either Serbia or Russia in the semi-finals on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Pospisil and Shapovalov have played in every rubber so far with captain Frank Dancevic short of options.</p>
      <p>"It's been a pretty surreal week," he said. "I'm so proud of these guys. I mean, these two guys playing all week.</p>
      <p>"Now that we're here, we're going to try to go all the way."</p>
      <p>Australia, who won the last of their 28 Davis Cup crowns in 2003, were surprisingly without Nick Kyrgios, who won both his singles matches in the group-stage wins over Colombia and Belgium, and he was sorely missed.</p>
      <p>Kyrgios, who banged down 22 aces against Belgian Steve Darcic on Wednesday, was sidelined with a collarbone injury.</p>
      <p>Canada's tennis fortunes have soared recently and Bianca Andreescu won the U.S. Open women's title this year.</p>
      <p>They are now in only their third Davis Cup semi-final despite arriving in Spain without injured Milos Raonic and with fast-rising teenager Felix Auger-Aliassime in the squad but having played no part so far.</p>
      <p>Canada beat the United States in the group phase on Tuesday, their first victory over their neighbours in 16 attempts.</p>
      <p>Their record against Australia was almost as bad, losing all 10 of the Davis Cup ties between the two countries.</p>
      <p>But the big-serving Pospisil has been a man on a mission since arriving in the Spanish capital and gave his side a superb start as he beat 48th-ranked Millman.</p>
      <p>Pospisil was in early trouble and trailed 4-1 but he battled back to force a tiebreak in which he saved two set points before taking the opener.</p>
      <p>The second set went with serve until Pospisil found two stunning forehands when Millman served at 4-5 to claim the win.</p>
      <p>Shapovalov played superbly in the opening set to overpower fellow 20-year-old De Minaur but he could not sustain his level and the wily Australian, ranked 18th, hit back.</p>
      <p>Shapovalov gathered himself, though, and threatened to break in the eighth game of the decider before saving three break points at 4-4 from 0-40.</p>
      <p>De Minaur did break at 5-5 and held serve to take the tie into a doubles decider but Canada would not be denied and it was appropriate that Pospisil, the player of the week, sealed the victory with a commanding last service game.</p>
