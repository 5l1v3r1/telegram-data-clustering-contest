      <p>The Ring Peephole Cam is getting its first <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">discount</a> today, dropping down to just $149. That's $50 off of its regular price.</p>
      <p>This doorbell from Ring is designed for those that live in apartments and can't install a video doorbell outside of their door. Instead, this one attaches to the peephole outside your door. And will still do everything that a regular Ring Doorbell is able to do.</p>
      <p>This includes showing you video of who is at your door, on the Ring app or on an Echo Show device. It will notify you if someone presses the button on the Ring Peephole Cam, or if they don't. So if someone is attempting to steal a package from in front of your door, you'll know. And you'll also see exactly who it is.</p>

      <p>The video on the Ring Peephole Cam is a wide-angle camera, so it is able to get the entire hallway, from the floor to the ceiling. It outputs video in 1080p, which isn't too bad, but it's also not all that great. It's good enough to see what's happening. Luckily, in an apartment, you won't need to zoom in to get someone's face, since they will be right in front of the camera.</p>
      <p>Ring also says that if your Peephole Cam gets stolen, they will replace it for free. Since it isn't screwed into the door like the regular Ring Video Doorbell would be, it can be stolen somewhat easily. Which would suck, but you would know when someone takes it down â€“ as you'll get a notification that someone is at the door. So at least there's that.</p>
      <p>You can pick up the Ring Peephole Cam on discount now from Amazon <a href="https://geni.us/hfrtdo">by clicking here</a>. This price isn't going to last very long, so you'll want to grab it before it's gone.</p>
