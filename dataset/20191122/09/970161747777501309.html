      <p>Anti-Brexit campaigners who bought thebrexitparty.com are hoping to make a handsome profit at the expense of Nigel Farage.</p>
      <p>Led by Donkeys are offering to sell it to him for over a million pounds and said the fee, which will increase by £50,000 each day, would be donated to the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI)</p>
      <p>It comes after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> Party lawyers demanded the activist group remove their logo from the site, launched in May during the European Parliament elections.</p>
      <p>But Led by Donkeys are refusing to transfer the domain name, which is similar to the party’s thebrexitparty.org.</p>
      <p>The spoof website features a rising total of the cost and an ‘election advent calendar’ – offering examples of ‘lies, lunacy and hypocrisy’ of the the party as well as the Tories.</p>

        <figcaption>The website now features a Christmas advent calendar containing warnings about the Brexit Party, Nigel Farage and the Tories (Picture: PA)</figcaption>

      <p>Behind the first door is a video of the Brexit Party leader saying ‘we’re going to have to move to an insurance-based system of healthcare’.</p>

      <p>Led by Donkeys co-founder Oliver Knowles said: ‘When Farage and his millionaire backers set up the Brexit Party they didn’t have the foresight to buy up all of the websites with their own name – and we did.</p>
      <p>‘With the advent calendar, we are telling the story of the Brexit Party and the Tory Party who are now election partners – and the threat they represent to the country.’</p>
      <p>He said he thought donating to the JCWI would be a ‘good and just cause’ given Farage peddling an ‘ideology of hatred and division’.</p>

      <p>Led by Donkeys ridiculed the recent approach from Brexit Party lawyers and said their eight-page legal letter cites European Union law five times as justification of its claim.</p>
      <p>The group tweeted: ‘Who knew Nigel Farage was such a fan of European law?’</p>
      <p>All Brexit Party materials and logos have been removed from the current version of the website following the cease and desist letter issued by lawyers Wedlake Bell.</p>
      <p>But a party spokesman said Led by Donkeys are ‘so far refusing to transfer the domain name’.</p>
      <p>The pro-remain campaigners made a name for itself with large displays and billboards in public spaces designed to make Brexiteer’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/17/past-top-brexiteers-comes-back-haunt-massive-billboards-8354027/">pasts come back to haunt them. </a></p>
