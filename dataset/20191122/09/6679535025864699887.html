      <h1>Davis Cup Finals narrows down to final 8</h1>
      <h2>Canada's tennis revolution continues.</h2>

      <p>The Davis Cup Finals has been narrowed down to a star-studded group of eight teams following the conclusion of the round-robin action at tennis’ premier international team competition.</p>
      <p>The squads that secured their place in the quarter-finals from the six round-robin groups include Serbia and host Spain — led by Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, respectively — as well as Great Britain, who almost certainly will require the heroics of three-time Grand Slam singles champion Andy Murray to win the title, reports Efe news.</p>
      <p>Three of the other five remaining teams feature players who are not household names yet but have very bright futures.</p>
      <p>Denis Shapovalov, 20, is leading the way for Canada, while Alex De Minaur, also aged 20, and Nick Kyrgios head up a deep Australian side.</p>
      <p>Karen Khachanov, 23, and Andrey Rublev, 22, meanwhile are part of promising generation of Russian players.</p>
      <p>Yet another very talented young player, 19-year-old Felix Auger-Aliassime, also is on Canada’s roster but has not seen any action due to an ankle issue and to the strong play of his replacement, Vasek Pospisil.</p>
      <p>The quarterfinal line-up is rounded out by Germany and Argentina, who will hope their veteran players can pull off an upset.</p>
      <p>The first match of the final eight kicked off on Thursday night, with Group F winner Canada taking on Group D winner Australia.</p>
      <p>The other three quarterfinal ties will be played on Friday: Group A winner Serbia versus Group B runner-up Russia, Group B winner Spain against Group C runner-up Argentina and Group E winner Great Britain vs Group C winner Germany.</p>
      <p>For decades, different Davis Cup rounds were played throughout the season, with one team playing host to another squad up to and including the final.</p>
