      <p>Cape Town – Lori Loughlin pleaded not guilty to new charges in the college admissions scandal on Tuesday and waived her right to appear in court over the allegations, reports <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/lori-loughlin-pleads-not-guilty-new-charges-college-admission-scandal-n1087156"><b>NBC</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for the Full House actress and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, submitted their pleas for "conspiracy to commit federal program bribery", according to People. This is on top of accusations that the couple allegedly paid $500 000 to admissions consultant and mastermind of the scandal, William "Rick" Singer, to help falsify that Loughlin and Giannulli's daughters were recruits for sports they hardly played to get them special admission consideration.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/11/lori-loughlin-felicity-huffman-community-service"><b>Vanity Fair's explainer</b></a>, the couple could get a significantly longer sentence than Felicity Huffman, who pleaded guilty and had fewer indictments as well – the <i>Desperate Housewives</i> actress <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/News/actress-huffman-gets-14-days-jail-in-us-college-admissions-scandal-20190913"><b>served her 14-day sentence in October</b></a> and now reportedly plans on <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/19/felicity-huffman-wants-to-help-female-inmates-after-spending-time-in-prison/"><b>spending time helping female inmates</b></a> after seeing the "harsh" conditions of those women.</p>
      <p>Lori Loughlin may not be as lucky due to their plea and the nature of their case.</p>
      <p>The actress and her husband could get a minimum of two to three years in prison if found guilty legal analyst, Dan Abrams, told <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/dan-abrams-judge-in-lori-loughlin-case-is-most-critical-factor-we-now-know-exactly-what-hes-thinking/"><b>Good Morning America</b></a>.</p>
