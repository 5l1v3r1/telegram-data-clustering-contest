      <p>BOSTON (AP) — A former Boston College student charged with involuntary manslaughter for allegedly encouraging her boyfriend to take his life is being arraigned.</p>
      <p>Twenty-one-year-old Inyoung You is in court Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say she sent Alexander Urtula, of Cedar Grove, New Jersey, more than 47,000 text messages in the last two months of the relationship, including many urging him to “go kill yourself.”</p>
      <p>Urtula died in Boston on May 20, the day of his Boston College graduation.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week You, through a public relations firm, released text messages suggesting she tried to stop Urtula and alerted Urtula’s brother in the moments before his death.</p>
      <p>When You was indicted in October, prosecutors said she was in South Korea.</p>
