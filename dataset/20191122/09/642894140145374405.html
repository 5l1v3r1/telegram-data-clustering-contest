      <p>“Nutanix’s DNA is rooted in disruptive innovation on behalf of its customers. I am delighted to partner with Dheeraj and the executive team to accelerate Nutanix’s position as a leader in enterprise cloud computing,” said Maner. “Nutanix has accomplished so much over the past 10 years, but there’s so much potential to go even further. I am excited to charge ahead and play a critical role in helping realise Nutanix’s vision of making computing invisible, anywhere.”</p>
      <p>Maner’s responsibilities will include leading critical hybrid cloud-focused strategy and product teams, including Nutanix’s core virtualisation platform (AHV), software-defined networking, and some of the key hybrid cloud services: End-user computing (Xi Frame), database as a service (Era), DR as a service (Xi Leap), Xi Partner Network (XPN), and solutions engineering.</p>
      <p>Maner brings more than 25 years of experience as an executive at disruptive technology companies in the IT infrastructure space. Most recently, he served as Chairman and CEO at Nexenta Systems, leading the organisation from its open source focus through its acquisition by DataDirect Networks (DDN) in May 2019. Prior to Nexenta, he was the President and CEO at Wyse Technology, one of the virtual desktop computing pioneers acquired by Dell in 2012. He also held executive roles at Dell, CA Technologies, IBM and Sterling Software. Maner served on the boards of several organisations, including Teradici, CloudCheckr, Wheels, and leading non-profit organisations in Silicon Valley.</p>
      <p>“Tarkan brings an entrepreneurial mindset and an acute awareness of the computing landscape to lead Nutanix in its second decade,” said Dheeraj Pandey, Chairman, Founder and CEO at Nutanix. “His authentic leadership style, a clear bias for action, and a broad industry network have helped him create high-energy companies, as I’ve observed him from afar. Given his deep sense of commitment to company-building, I look forward to this new partnership to build Nutanix into a hybrid cloud powerhouse.”</p>
