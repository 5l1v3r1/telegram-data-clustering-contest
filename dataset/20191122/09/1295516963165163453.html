      <h1>Why Alan Moore is Voting for the First Time in 40 Years</h1>

      <p>Alan Moore, legendary writer of <a href="https://cbr.com/tag/watchmen">Watchmen</a>, <i>Swamp Thing</i> and <i>V for Vendetta</i>, is famously an anarchist (it was obviously a major plot point in <i>V for Vendetta</i>). However, he has broken from his over 40-year history of not voting to explain why he is voting in next month's General Election in Britain.</p>
      <p>Moore's daughters Amber and Leah Moore <a href="https://twitter.com/leahmoore/status/1197225301815771136">shared the writer's words on their social media accounts</a>, as the icon explains the importance of this particular election and why he exhorts others in Great Britain to follow his lead.</p>

      <p><a href="https://screenrant.com/alan-moore-retiring-writing-comic-books/">Moore</a> has previously come out in support of Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, but has consistently declined to vote in elections because he believes in "direct political action." However, the upcoming General Election has forced him to change his position.</p>
      <p>“Here’s something you don’t see every day, an internet-averse anarchist announcing on social media that he’ll be voting Labour in the December elections. But these are unprecedented times. I’ve voted only once in my life, more than 40 years ago, being convinced that leaders are mostly of benefit to no one save themselves. That said, some leaders are so unbelievably malevolent and catastrophic that they must be strenuously opposed by any means available."</p>

      <p>Those statements make it clear that Moore's stance is more about his specific opposition to Boris Johnson and the Conservative Party rather than his support for Corbyn and Labour, but Moore does note that he <i>has</i> been very impressed by Corbyn's proposals. Still, his disgust with Johnson is the driving force of his position. He adds, “Though these are immensely complicated times and we are all uncertain as to which course we should take, I’d say the one that steers us furthest from the glaringly apparent iceberg is the safest bet.”</p>
      <p>Moore concludes by imploring his fans to vote, as well. "If my work has meant anything to you over the years, if the way that modern life is going makes you fear for all the things you value, then please get out there on polling day and make your voice heard with a vote against this heartless trampling of everybody's safety, dignity and dreams. A world we love is counting on us."</p>
      <p>The British General Election is on December 12th.</p>
