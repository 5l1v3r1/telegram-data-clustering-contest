      <p>JOHANNESBURG – United States (US) Ambassador to South Africa Lana Marks on Thursday said that President Donald Trump has been misunderstood.</p>
      <p>Marks, a South African-born handbag designer, was sworn in as ambassador last month after she was confirmed in the US Senate.</p>
      <p>She spoke to Radio702 about her goals and priorities.</p>
      <p>Trump has said some controversial things about South Africa, including that it was just waiting to explode and that it was “a total and dangerous mess”.</p>
      <p>Marks was asked what South Africans should make of this: “I think there’s a misunderstanding on President Trump. So, what he’s really saying, he’s talking about the negatives, which we need to address and what President Ramaphosa is addressing.”</p>
      <p>The ambassador also spoke about concerns that Trump would cut humanitarian aid to Africa, reprioritising that money to the military.</p>
      <p>“I am confident in saying the opposite is what’s going to happen.”</p>
      <p>When asked about the impeachment proceedings currently under way against the US president, she said: “For two years we’ve heard about collusion. In the end, there was nothing.”</p>
      <p>She said Trump loved and supported South Africa and hoped to visit the country soon.</p>
