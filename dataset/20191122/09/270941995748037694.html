      <h1>Munich 'no longer most expensive city for renting' in Germany</h1>

        <b>Munich is no longer the most expensive city for renting in Germany, a new study has revealed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.f-und-b.de/beitrag/fb-mietspiegelindex-2019-veroeffentlicht.html">Research and Consulting Company for Housing, Real Estate and the Environment (F+B)</a>, the Bavarian capital has been overtaken by Stuttgart.</p>
      <p>Tenants have to pay significantly more to rent an apartment in the Baden-Württemberg city, where the average net cold rent (before extra costs such as for heating and insurance) is now €10.41 per square metre.</p>
      <p>This makes Stuttgart the most expensive city for tenants in Germany for the first time since F+B started compiling their research in 1996, pushing Munich into second place.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Overall, the study found rents in Germany are continuing to rise, although not as strongly as in previous years.</p>
      <p>In 2019, rents climbed by 1.8 percent, 0.4 percentage points less than in 2018.</p>
      <p>Tenants in Germany have to pay on average €7.04 per square metre. According to the study, local comparative rents are most reasonable in the likes of Erfurt, eastern Berlin, Potsdam, Dresden and Schwerin.</p>
      <p>"Stuttgart residents pay an average of €10.41 per square metre of net rent for their apartments, 48 percent above the €7.04 per square metre paid on average in cities," said F+B managing director Dr. Bernd Leutner.</p>
      <p>Munich is ranked sixth and tenants pay an average of €9.74 per square metre for net cold rent, according to the study.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Berlin becomes more expensive – but not for everyone</b>
      </p>
      <p>Prices in Hamburg, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt am Main and Cologne are also far above the overall average – in Berlin, on the other hand, they are only slightly above the average at €7.32 per square metre.</p>
      <p>According to F+B, tenants with old leases in Berlin have a much better deal compared to newcomers.</p>
      <p>Although existing rents in old and new flats have recently risen at an above-average rate, long-term tenants can still live relatively cheaply in the capital.</p>

        <b>Suburbs becoming more expensive than cities</b>
      </p>
      <p>The most expensive municipality for tenants is Karlsfeld in the district of Dachau in the neighbourhood of Munich, F+B reported. The average net cold rent here reaches €10.86 per square metre. The cities of Germering and Dachau, where there are also very high rent costs, are also in Bavaria.</p>

      <p>"This shows that the old rule that anyone who wants to live more cheaply must move to the surrounding area no longer applies in the same way," F+B explained.</p>
      <p>The high cost of renting an apartment in German cities has led to more demand for homes in the surrounding area and suburbs, which in turn pushes up prices there.</p>
      <p>Overall, the top 10 most expensive cities for tenants are located in southern Germany, the most prosperous part of the country.</p>

      <p>F+B annually compares rent overviews and the development of the housing costs to find out what Germany's tenants have to pay on average.</p>
      <p>The company examines the net cold rents of typical 65 square metre flats in municipalities and cities with at least 20,000 people to produce a rent index. In 2019 there were 351 cities in the index.</p>
