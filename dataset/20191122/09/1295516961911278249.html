      <h1>The Flash's Latest Casting Points To a Female Mirror Master</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:11:11+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:11</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Arvedon</a></address>
      <p>Season 6 of The CW's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-flash-tv/"><i>The Flash</i></a> is expanding its cast with the addition of Efrat Dor, who'll join Season 6 as a series regular following "Crisis on Infinite Earths."</p>
      <p>According to <i><a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/21/the-flash-efrat-dor-eva-mcculloch-iris/">EW</a></i>, Dor will play Eva McCulloch, whose character description is as follows: "A quantum engineer and co-founder of McCulloch Technologies, Eva McCulloch is a scientific genius who works on the bleeding edge. Eva has been away from Central City for many years. But a chance meeting with Iris West-Allen results in a surprising alliance that pushes the boundaries of sanity, while also uncovering a vast conspiracy to take down Team Flash and its allies."</p>

      <p>While it isn't explicitly stated, it's believed Dor's character will be a female version of Mirror Master as the name "Eva McCulloch" is strikingly similar to "<i>Evan</i> McCulloch," the Mirror Master of the Arrowverse's <a href="https://screenrant.com/arrow-earth-2-destroyed-crisis-infinite-earths/">recently destroyed Earth-2</a>.</p>
      <p>Created by Grant Morrison and Chaz Truong, the comic book version of Evan McCulloch debuted in 1989's <i>Animal Man</i> #8. After the death of his parents, he was contacted by the FBI and gifted with the former Mirror Master Sam Scudder's equipment, including his Mirror Gun, and he eventually joined the Rogues in their neverending feud with The Flash.</p>
