      </p>
      <p>Mourinho was officially unveiled as Spurs' new manager on Thursday, charming the press with a refreshed and honest style.</p>
      <p>Among many topics discussed, he also elaborated on choosing his third team to manage in England.</p>
      <p>"This is modern football. In relation to players, the Bosman law changed everything. In relation to us coaches, because of you (the media), we lost that stability," he said, as quoted by the <i>Daily Express</i>.</p>
      <p>"The relationships are fast. Players can get tired of each other, they can get tired of the manager. Everything is faster.</p>

      <p>"When I went to Manchester United with a free mind, with a free heart. Manchester United occupied my heart even with things I did not enjoy too much.</p>
      <p>"But I loved so many things there, the fans, the people that worked at the club. But now it is about Spurs and I just hope I can be really, really happy here and make people happy, and try and make sure there is not a bigger fan than myself.</p>
      <p>"If there is one person in the world who wants Spurs to win and be successful – there is not one person that wants it more than me, maybe the same but not more.</p>
      <p>"Chelsea is the past. A great past, two periods of titles, a great past, but it is the past."</p>
