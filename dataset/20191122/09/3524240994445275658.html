      <h1>Boy, 9, spends 9 months studying electrical engineering, rated three times smarter</h1>

      <p>A nine-year-old boy who is studying electrical engineering at the University of Technology in Eindhoven, The Netherlands, is set to be the youngest ever graduate after nine months.</p>
      <p>His university is saying that he is three times smarter than any student they’ve ever had.</p>
      <p>According to<a href="https://uk.yahoo.com/news/boy-graduate-aged-nine-university-says-hes-three-151700481.html"> Sky News</a>, Laurent Simons, who is inspired by inventor Nikola Tesla, spent just nine months to complete a degree that would normally take three years to do.</p>
      <p>Laurent is rated to possess an IQ of 145, and will graduate in December.</p>
      <p>He has reportedly expressed his plans to start a PhD and to also “study a little medicine.”</p>

      <p>He says he wants to research artificial organs and develop a Terminator-style artificial body.</p>
      <p>As an undergraduate at Eindhoven, he has been working on a research project involving “placing neurons and making connections” to test the effects of different medication on the brain.</p>
      <p>It is not all about learning for Laurent, though, as he spends his free time playing Fortnite and Minecraft, while he also looks after his nine-week-old puppy named Sammy, and also entertains almost 40,000 followers on Instagram.</p>
      <p>The university has been amazed by his progress, having joined after completing high school in a single year,<i> Sky News</i> notes.</p>
      <p>Programme director Sjoerd Hulshof said: “Every professor is really enthusiastic about having Laurent and for us, it’s a unique situation of course because he’s the youngest student we’ve ever had.</p>
      <p>“The speed of his mind — we cannot imagine what is happening in his head. He’s maybe three times smarter than the smartest student we’ve ever had.”</p>
      <p>Laurent will comfortably be the youngest person in history to obtain a university degree, beating the previous record by more than a year.</p>
      <p>According to the Guinness Book of World Records, American Michael Kearney was aged 10 years and four months when he graduated in June 1994.</p>
      <p>Laurent could also end up in the US for his PhD, but his parents are not putting him under any pressure to make a decision.</p>
      <p>Father Alexander said: “What he’s doing now is playing with education, just playing around, and that’s fine with us.”</p>
