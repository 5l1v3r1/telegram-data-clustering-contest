      <p>KAMPALA - <b>A record 25,000 kits have been bought for this year’s MTN Kampala Marathon. MTN Uganda Chief Executive Wim Vanhelleputte announced yesterday that the kit had sold out. Vanhelleputte had paid a courtesy call to the Speaker of Parliament Rebecca Kadaga to hand over 200 pieces of the kit for the legislators. </b></p>
      <p>The marathon has in recent years according to organisers consistently attracted over 20,000 participants. This is, however, the first time that MTN officially comes out to state that 25,000 kits have been sold.<br/><br/>This is a huge improvement from 1500 entrants in the inaugural edition of the annual event.<br/><br/>Proceeds from this year’s marathon will go towards the improvement of maternal health. The marathon is today Uganda’s biggest social event. Vision Group, Stanbic, Huawei, Rwenzori, Uganda Athletics Federation, and Uganda Police are some of the marathon key partners. <br/><br/>World and Olympic champion Stephen Kiprotich and double Commonwealth and African champion Moses Kipsiro are some of the big names that have featured in the annual race.<br/><br/>The race also attracts a big international entry. Prominent amongst these are the Kenyans who have dominated the podium. There will be five, 10, 21, 42 kilometer and wheelchair races</p>
