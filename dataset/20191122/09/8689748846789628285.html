      <h1>No more airtime top-up deductions starting November 26 – Vodafone CEO</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:14:01+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/adu/" target="_blank">Adu Sarpeah</a></address>
      <p>Chief Executive Officer of Vodafone Ghana has revealed that her company will from November 26 halt the upfront deduction of Communication Service Tax (CST) from airtime top-up.</p>
      <p>Patricia Obo-Nai stated that customers will henceforth receive the exact amount of airtime they purchase, unlike how their top-up balance currently reflects a deduction of the CST.</p>
      <p>“In the past when you recharge ¢1, I will take ¢0.70 pesewas and give it to government,” she told Daniel Dadzie host of Joy FM’s Super Morning Show, Thursday.</p>
      <p>It could be recalled that the Communications Ministry made Ghanaians privy to their willingness to punish Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) for defying directives in reference to Communications Services Tax (CST). This was in a bid to stop telecommunications companies from giving their customers less airtime than they purchased.</p>

      </p>
      <p>As a reminder, the implementation of the CST has been a controversial topic, as customers say they are being cheated by the telecommunication companies. So, as it stands, Vodafone subscribers will no longer see deductions starting November 26.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, the remaining telecommunication companies in Ghana will follow suit accordingly.</p>
