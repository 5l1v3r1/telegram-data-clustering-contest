      <p>A nasty stomach bug is 'dropping people like dominoes' across the South West recently.</p>
      <p>Dozens of reports are coming in of an outbreak in a nasty illness that is very similar to the highly contagious norovirus throughout November and into December.</p>
      <p>Cases have been reported across the UK, including at a huge lego event here in Bristol.</p>
      <p>
        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p>In response Public Health England and the NHS advise people who believe they are ill to contain themselves and follow strict hygiene procedures.</p>
      <p>People have reported projectile vomiting, diarrhea, and suffering aches, pains and headaches.</p>

      <p>Vanessa Kirby from Reading said she and her husband had been struck down by the condition including vomiting, high temperatures and stomach cramps.</p>
      <p>One man, who got sick along with his two-year-old daughter, told them: "I thought it was food poisoning to start with, but then other friends of the family started to feel sick.</p>
      <p>"Then another friend, who I hadn't seen for a while, got ill as did her husband.</p>
      <p>"She was told by doctors that there was a bad bug going around at the moment.</p>
      <p>"Six people I know have got poorly in recent days. Luckily, mine cleared up in less than 24 hours."</p>

      <p>Sally Ball from Derbyshire said she had never felt so ill in her life.</p>
      <p>"My son, daughter and granddaughters from Derbyshire caught it last week. Now myself and my partner have been suffering with it, I have an auto immune disease so I have had it now for 4 days," she said.</p>
      <p>"It is dreadful never felt so ill in my life why are people not being informed about it as it is obviously spread across the country quite quickly, if people are aware they can put procedures in place to help prevent the spread."</p>
      <h3>NHS advice for stomach bugs like norovirus:</h3>
      <p>Try to avoid going to your GP, as norovirus can spread to others very easily. Call your GP or NHS 111 if you’re concerned or need any advice.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Symptoms</b>
      </p>
      <p>You’re likely to have norovirus if you experience: suddenly feeling sick, projectile vomiting, watery diarrhoea.</p>
      <p>Some people also have a slight fever, headaches, painful stomach cramps and aching limbs.</p>
      <p>The symptoms appear one to two days after you become infected and typically last for up to two or three days.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What to do if you have norovirus:</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Stay at home until you’re feeling better. </b>There’s no cure for norovirus, so you have to let it run its course.</li>
        <li><b>You don’t usually need to get medical advice</b> unless there’s a risk of a more serious problem.</li>
        <li><b>Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration</b>. You need to drink more than usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea – as well as water, adults could also try fruit juice and soup. Avoid giving fizzy drinks or fruit juice to children as it can make their diarrhoea worse. Babies should continue to feed as usual, either with breast milk or other milk feeds.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Take paracetamol for any fever or aches and pains.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Get plenty of rest</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>If you feel like eating, <b>eat plain foods such as soup, rice, pasta and bread</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Use special rehydration drinks</b> made from sachets bought from pharmacies if you have signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth or dark urine.</li>
        <li><b>Adults can take antidiarrhoeal and anti-emetic (anti-vomiting) medication</b> – these aren’t suitable for everyone though, so you should check the medicine leaflet or ask or your pharmacist or GP for advice before trying them.</li>
        <li><b>Babies and young children,</b> especially if they’re less than a year old, have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated.</li>
        <li>Norovirus can spread very easily, so you should wash your hands regularly while you’re ill and stay off work or school until <b>at least 48 hours after the symptoms have cleared</b> to reduce the risk of passing it on.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>When to get medical advice:</b>
      </p>
      <p>You don’t normally need to see your GP if you think you or your child has norovirus, as there’s no specific treatment for it. Antibiotics won’t help because it’s caused by a virus.</p>
      <p>Visiting your GP surgery with norovirus can put others at risk, so it’s best to call your GP or NHS 111 if you’re concerned or feel you need advice.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Get medical advice if:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your baby or child has passed 6 or more watery stools in the past 24 hours, or has vomited 3 times or more in the past 24 hours</li>
        <li>Your baby or child is less responsive, feverish, or has pale or mottled skin</li>
        <li>You or your child has symptoms of severe dehydration, such as persistent dizziness, only passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all, or reduced consciousness – babies and elderly people have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated</li>
        <li>You have bloody diarrhoea</li>
        <li>Your symptoms haven’t started to improve after a few days</li>
        <li>You or your child have a serious underlying condition, such as kidney disease, and have diarrhoea and vomiting</li>
        <li>Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your stool to a laboratory to confirm whether you have norovirus or another infection.</li>
      </ul>
