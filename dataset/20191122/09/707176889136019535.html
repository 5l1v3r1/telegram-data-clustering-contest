      <h1>Tesla unveils bold design for ‘Cybertruck’</h1>
      <h2>Elon Musk hopes Bond-inspired electric vehicle will be a hit with pick-up drivers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:01:25+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:01</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Waters</a></address>
      <p>Elon Musk has taken the wraps off a new vehicle designed to put a dent in one of Detroit’s most profitable markets, unveiling an angular wedge-shaped Tesla electric pick-up truck.</p>
      <p>Called the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a379bd08-0d47-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">Cybertruck, the latest model from Tesla</a> takes aim at a market currently dominated by Ford and General Motors and accounting for the three best selling vehicles in the US this year.</p>
      <p>Mr Musk surprised an invited audience at Tesla’s design studio in Los Angeles on Thursday evening by disclosing an entry price for the hotly anticipated vehicle that was $10,000 below expectations, with three versions that have base prices ranging from $39,900-$69,000.</p>
      <p>This marks a departure from the company’s normal tactic of breaking into a market with high-priced models and racing to force prices down as production volumes rise. But putting it within reach of most pick-up truck buyers also raises the spectre of renewed pressure on margins, at a time when Tesla is enjoying a rare respite from Wall Street unhappiness over flagging profitability.</p>
      <p>The pick-up market presents a new test of Mr Musk’s ability to generate buzz and break the mould. With its entrenched brands, conservative buyers and a high proportion of fleet sales, Tesla will be forced to focus either on a narrow niche or find a way of expanding the market by drawing new buyers to the category, analysts said.</p>

      <p>“Especially in the US, people who buy larger trucks aren’t prepared to make the leap, they want the tried and the true,” said Alyssa Altman, a transportation consultant at Publicis Sapient. “It’s very hard to shift someone who is brand-loyal to a truck.”</p>
      <p>Mr Musk is betting on the combination of an electric drivetrain and eye-catching design to shatter expectations. He could be helped by the fact that pick-ups are moving into the mainstream, much as SUVs did before them, according to Jessica Caldwell at Edmunds, an automobile research firm. As suburban buyers with little need for the vehicles’ rugged performance jump in, demand for pick-ups has grown steadily to reach 18 per cent of new vehicle sales in the US in the first 10 months of this year, according to Edmunds.</p>

      <p>An electric pick-up truck has been a personal passion of Mr Musk’s for years, and he warned in advance that its drastic new design would not be for everyone. That prompted many analysts to warn that Tesla was likely to alienate many existing truck buyers, even as it set itself apart from the herd. Mr Musk pointed to a Lotus Esprit that figured in the James Bond film <i>The Spy Who Loved Me</i>, from 1977, as one inspiration for the vehicle’s design.</p>
      <p>The truck’s body is made from the same steel used in SpaceX’s Starship rocket and can withstand a 9mm bullet, Mr Musk said. But a demonstration intended to show off the vehicle’s toughness backfired when the truck’s windows — said to be made of “transparent metal glass” — cracked under a battering from a heavy steel ball.</p>
      <p>If the angular steel skin and lower starting price are the vehicle’s main selling points, performance details released on Thursday suggested that, under the hood, it could be more than a match for its main rivals. The Cybertruck will be able to tow 14,000lbs — less than half the amount Mr Musk appeared to promise earlier this year, but still more than its conventional rivals.</p>

      <p>Tesla showed videos of its truck winning a tug of war against the top-selling Ford F-150 while also outracing a Porsche 911, with claimed acceleration of 0-60mph in 2.9 seconds. The Cybertruck’s three versions range from a single-motor truck with a range of 250 miles, up to a top-of-the-line three motor version capable of doing 500 miles on a charge.</p>
      <p>“It’s a wow factor in terms of design and the price point is eye-popping,” said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. “They needed to have a game-changer product. This is the way to go.”</p>

      <p>Tesla’s attack on the pick-up truck market stands in stark contrast to electric truck <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb382c38-6699-11e9-9adc-98bf1d35a056">start-up Rivian</a>, which jumped ahead of the market a year ago when it unveiled the R1T, aimed at the top end of the market and starting at $69,000. The Detroit-based company, which earlier this year received a $500m investment from Ford and also has the backing of Amazon, is counting on a traditional design aimed squarely at existing truck buyers.</p>

      <p>Rivian also looks set to have a considerable head start on Tesla, with shipments due to start late next year. Mr Musk did not announce a launch date for the Cybertruck, though Wall Street has been expecting production in 2021.</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck’s arrival coincides with a new phase of competition in the EV market. Ford this week unveiled its most ambitious battery electric vehicle to date, an SUV called <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b0cf2378-0705-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd">the Mach-E</a> that draws on the Mustang brand.</p>
      <p>The Mach-E shows that Detroit’s incumbents have been learning from Tesla and others in the market, and suggests that they will be formidable rivals in electric pick-ups, said Ms Altman. GM plans to launch an electric pick-up next year, while Ford has a hybrid version of its F-150 in the works and is planning an all-electric model.</p>
      <p>“They’re going to watch what Tesla does, watch the mistakes it makes. They’re going to figure it out,” said Ms Altman.</p>
