      <p>Jacob Gallagher has finally gone too far for his dad on Emmerdale, which results in him being him out of the house in an explosive twist tonight.</p>
      <p>The teen, who has descended into a downward spiral ever since he began being groomed by teacher Maya Stepney.</p>
      <p>And things got even worst when Maya was jailed and Jacob struggled to deal with the fact that he was groomed.</p>
      <p>After hearing that Maya had been released from prison, Jacob's bad behaviour began escalating again and led him to sleep with Leanna.</p>

      <p>Following this, Jacob acted coldly towards her and left her upset. Her dad Dr Liam Cavanagh discovered what had happened and punched Jacob in a fit of anger.</p>
      <p>Tonight, Jacob is confronted by his dad, granddad and mum, but he doesn't take it well.</p>
      <p>"We can't go on like this," David tells his son in a clip from tonight's episode.</p>
      <p>Jacob snaps: "I don't need another lecture."</p>

      <p>However his granddad shouts: "Just shut up for once, will you?!"</p>
      <p>"You've hurt too many people," David tells him. "And we love you but we just can't cope with you.</p>
      <p>"I want you to leave."</p>
      <p>This comes just after revelation that Maya is pregnant, which no one in the village currently knows about.</p>
      <p>Will Jacob and David find out about the baby when their relationship is at its lowest point?</p>
