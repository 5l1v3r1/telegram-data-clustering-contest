      <p>Is temporary crossing possible?</p>
      <p>Recently, in the dark, my bus let me off on Broadway by the YWCA. There was a police crime scene across the street and about 11 police vehicles all along Broadway. Since the crosswalk at the light was not an option, I went a block away to cross. This was worrisome, due to my knowledge of two church members hit on Broadway, one in the dark early morning hours, and another at a light!</p>
      <p>I want the police to provide a temporary crosswalk across Broadway and any other four- to six-lane street when the normal crosswalk at a light is barred due to police activity. People are distracted from safe driving when the police are present, and it is risky to cross, but I had no other way to get home!</p>
