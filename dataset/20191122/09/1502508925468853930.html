      <p>Amid various speculations over government formation in Maharashtra, Union Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nitin-gadkari">Nitin Gadkari </a>on Friday said that the ideological differences between Congress, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>and NCP will lead to instability of their government even if it is formed.</p>
      <p>"There are ideological differences among Congress, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>and NCP. The government will not go much ahead even if it is formed", Gadkari said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile a Congress Legislative party meet is underway at Vidhan Bhavan in Mumbai.</p>
      <p>Earlier NCP and Congress leaders met with leaders of other allies to hold discussions over the political situation of the state.</p>
      <p>NCP, Congress and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>are holding hectic deliberations and talks and are inching closer towards government formation in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a meeting of NCP-Congress-Shiv Sena meeting is scheduled at 4 pm today.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra came under President's Rule on November 12 after all the parties failed to form a government in the state. The BJP, which emerged as the single largest party, could not stake claim to form a government as its ally Shiv Sena remained firm on rotating the Chief Minister's post and equal sharing of Cabinet berths.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena parted its ways with BJP to explore ways to form a government. It, however, failed to prove the support of the required number of MLAs in the time given by state Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari.The Governor had then invited NCP, the third-largest party, to prove its ability to form the government failing which President's Rule was imposed in the state.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena is now in talks with the Congress and NCP to form a government in Maharashtra.The BJP won 105 seats in the 288-member assembly followed by Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44.</p>
