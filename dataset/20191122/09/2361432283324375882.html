      <h1>Pharrell Williams Wrote a Song About a Music Legend He'd Never Even Met for 'The Black Godfather'</h1>
      <h2>TheWrap Oscar magazine: “All these people that he opened doors for talked about his immense power, his business acumen and the energy he brought to a room,” Williams says of Clarence Avant</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:15:14+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/steve-pond/" target="_blank">Steve Pond</a></address>

        <i>A version of this story about Pharrell Williams and “The Black Godfather” first appeared in <a href="https://view.flipdocs.com/?ID=10004691_410902">The Race Begins issue</a> of TheWrap’s Oscar magazine.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Music-business executive Clarence Avant may have helped launch or sustain the careers of a long list of luminaries, including Quincy Jones, Bill Withers and athletes like Muhammad Ali and Hank Aaron, but his reach only extended to Pharrell Williams secondhand.</p>
      <p>“I know a lot of people that he was responsible for bringing into the industry, people who have directly affected my life and given me entrée into the industry,” said Williams, who co-wrote and performed the song “Letter to My Godfather” for the documentary about Avant, “The Black Godfather.”</p>
      <p>“But I didn’t meet him until later. I had always just heard his name — all these people that he opened doors for talked about his immense power, his business acumen and the energy he brought to a room.”</p>

      <p>Williams came to do the song, he said, when director Reginald Hudlin reached out to him. “He asked me to take a look at the documentary, and I just thought, ‘OK, cool,'” he said. “I thought it would be a typical music doc and give you the history. But when you realize all the backstory — where he came from, how he became the person he became, why he made the decisions he made — it painted a completely different picture for me.”</p>
      <p>And that picture, he said, went straight into the song, an unapologetic tribute to Avant. “When I started working on the music,” he said, “I tried to pretty much paint what I experienced for the first time in the movie.”</p>
      <p>“It came right out,” Pharrell said of writing the song. “I just knew it needed to have a choir in it, and I felt like the choir needed to do something staccato, which is the <i>ooos</i>. It needed open space so I could say what I really wanted to say, who he was and why he needs this now. And the song pretty much flowed.”</p>
