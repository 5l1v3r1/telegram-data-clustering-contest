        <b>FRANKFURT AM MAIN, Germany, Nov 22 – Christine Lagarde on Friday urged European countries to “innovate and invest” more to support growth at a time of global uncertainty, in her first major policy speech as president of the European Central Bank.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The ECB’s ultra-loose monetary policy would “achieve its goal faster and with fewer side effects” if euro area governments supported it with fiscal policy, Lagarde told a banking conference in Frankfurt.</b>
      </p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>The eurozone economy is expected to grow just 1.1 percent this year, she said, “much lower than previously forecast” as “trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties” take their toll.</p>
      <p>“Europe needs to innovate and invest to respond to these challenges and preserve its competitiveness in the longer run,” said Lagarde, the former head of the International Monetary Fund.</p>
      <p>She called for an investment drive across the 19-nation currency bloc that should be “more productive, more digital and greener”.</p>
      <p>The speech by Lagarde, who took on her new role as the ECB’s first female chief at the start of the month, was highly anticipated by markets keen for a hint of her future policy stance.</p>
      <p>She has previously suggested she would stick close to predecessor Mario Draghi’s accommodative monetary policy mix of cheap credit, record-low interest rates and massive bond purchases to stimulate the economy and drive up stubbornly low inflation.</p>
      <p>But she has also pledged to make her mark with a push for more action on climate change, gender equality and making the ECB’s language more jargon-free.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Lagarde said she would launch “a strategic review” of the bank’s monetary policies.</p>
