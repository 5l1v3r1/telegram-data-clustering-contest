      <h3>Android Security Rewards Program</h3>
      <p>Google launched the ASR program in 2015 to reward people who find and report security issues on Android OS. Over the years, this program has helped Google fix thousands of issues across the Android ecosystem. The company has awarded over 1,800 reports and paid out over four million dollars in the last four years.</p>
      <p>The web giant is now willing to pay $1 million for a "full chain remote code execution exploit with persistence" which compromises the Titan M security chip. Introduced in 2018 with the Pixel 3, the <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2018/10/google-pixel-3-most-secure-phone.html">Titan M security chip</a> offers multi-layer security of Pixel phones. Titan M is integrated into Verified Boot, Google's secure boot process, to protect devices from outside tampering. The chip also offers lock screen protection, on-device disk encryption, secure transactions in third-party apps, and more.</p>
