      <h1>'You have to feel the pressure': Inside the 'juggernaut' of Doctor Who series 12</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:15:15+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://metro.co.uk/author/emma-kelly/" target="_blank">Emma Kelly</a></address>
      <p>Each regeneration of the Time Lord on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a> comes with its own pressure.</p>
      <p>Christopher Eccleston carried the weight of a reboot on his shoulder. David Tennant marked the first big regeneration of the new era. Matt Smith was plagued with criticism he’d be too young. Peter Capaldi was plagued with criticism he’d be too old.</p>
      <p>But series 11 and the Thirteenth Doctor had an extra burden to bear, as Jodie Whittaker became the first woman to take on the role of the Doctor… a character that is an alien with two hearts that has already had 12 forms.</p>
      <p>Throw in a brand new showrunner, in the form of Broadchurch writer Chris Chibnall replacing Steven Moffatt, and not one, not two, but three new companions – Mandip Gill’s Yaz, Tosin Cole’s Ryan and Bradley Walsh’s Graham – and it was basically a three-tiered chocolate cake for the haters to get stuck into.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>However, the ten episode series, plus the New Year’s special, were positively received and the series opened with over 10 million people tuning in to watch Jodie as The Doctor.</p>
      <p>But if you think the pressure is off now that any teething problems have gone away, think again.</p>
      <p>‘If you think there’s less pressure, you’re probably not concentrating very well,’ Jodie told Metro.co.uk at BBC studios in Cardiff.</p>

      <p>‘We are the leads in a massive show that has a huge audience and that comes with a huge amount of responsibility, in a brilliant sense. You have to feel that, but it’s not debilitating. It’s probably the adrenaline we all run on anyway because we’ve picked a job where people clap you at the end of the day. We do probably thrive on pressure.’</p>
      <p>‘It’s a different type of pressure though,’ Tosin added.</p>
      <p>‘Last season it was more because it was a new show – not a new show but a new showrunner, a new Doctor, a new way of approaching the show, so you have all of that. Now it’s the pressure of building on what we’ve got and keeping the audience entertained and engaged with the show.’</p>
      <p>And that pressure to keep the audience is engaged means that Chris Chibnall and team are throwing everything but the kitchen sink – although that could be possessed by an alien too – at series 12.</p>

      <p>Chibnall explained: ‘We are on a journey with this Doctor and these characters so we want to do big, emotional, action-packed, scary, funny stories and we want to go up a level from last year. Last year was a recruitment year for the show, for the Doctor, getting everybody in. It’s always a stepping on point with a new Doctor, and also bringing that existing audience as well.</p>
      <p>‘This year, we’re saying to those people – “OK, here is the amazing world of Doctor Who, here’s lots of treats, here’s lots of new stuff, some old stuff, let’s see what you make of this”. But also for ourselves, the ambition is go up a level. And I think we’ve done that.’</p>

      <p>With what? Well, with the biggest premiere episode the show has ever done, plus a sprinkling of old monsters to excite diehard fans, including the Intergalactic Police, the Judoon.</p>
      <p>‘It was always the plan,’ Chris said of bringing back beloved monsters.</p>
      <p>‘This year it’s like, look at everything we’ve got in the toybox of Doctor Who. It was always the plan to have more old monsters. There’s a lovely balance, we’ve got some quite scary new monsters, because you want the people whether they’re five or 25 or 55 who joined us last year and hadn’t watched the show before, to show them all the treats Doctor Who can provide.’</p>

      <p>It’s not just viewers who’ll be smiling at familiar rhino horn-studded faces, as the cast were just as delighted to have the Judoon on set – although they presented a challenge to Jodie.</p>
      <p>‘It’s like having rock stars on set,’ Jodie said, before revealing that the prosthetics caused some rather awkward moments.</p>
      <p>‘We had rehearsed without the Judoon in full kit to get the movement and to make sure everyone knows where they’re standing, and then the full attire goes on, and all of a sudden the person in front of you isn’t speaking and I didn’t know that. Someone else who controls the Judoon’s movements is the voice, but they hadn’t been the voice in rehearsals. The actor opposite you is the person you’re acting with.</p>

      <p>‘In the take, I just felt like I’d never been on set before. “Why has noone noticed that guy over there is just shouting totally across this?” Even then when I got used to it, I still did that [looking towards the other actor] when someone was talking. It really threw me. It might not be a secret but it is a secret when noone tells you before you go.’</p>
      <p>The backstage crew in charge of costumes, props, makeup and prosthetics is truly unrivalled, with the Cardiff studios featuring an exhibit with some of series 11’s most intricate costumes, and every one of the Doctors’ sonic screwdrivers to show the craft that goes into each episode. And the attention to detail can transform even a close friend into a stranger.</p>

      <p>‘We worked on an episode – I won’t give anything away – the actress was in complete prosthetics and came onto the set,’ Bradley said.</p>
      <p>‘I had walked onto the set and everyone was talking to this actress. And I went, “oh, hi, you’ll have to reintroduce yourself later because I won’t know you without all that”. This person, I actually knew really well. I went “hi, I’m Brad”. “Yeah, I know.” It wasn’t until Mandip pointed it out and said “you worked with her on…” I went up to her and said “I’m ever so sorry”. I had no idea it was them. It’s extraordinary.’</p>
      <p>But all that detail to transport viewers to many, many other worlds also means a lot of time and lot of hard work. Filming for the upcoming series 12 of Doctor Who began in January 2019 and wrapped at the end of October, with 10 months of filming spanning South Africa, Wales, Tenerife and Gloucester. And with most scenes involving Jodie, Mandip, Tosin and Bradley running and fighting aliens, it’s no walk in the park.</p>
      <p>‘People have this misconception that actors show up and learn their lines and they sit about and people get them tea. However, Jodie especially, the lines are relentless,’</p>
      <p>Bradley said: ‘For all intents and purposes, it is gobbledegook. But the Whovian language you have to know inside out, which is extraordinary, Jodie has to learn that, and we’re a massive part of that too. The days are long, it’s not a 9 to 5 gig.</p>

      <p>‘Things change, the sands are always shifting. This is an ambitious shoot, it’s the most ambitious shoot I’ve ever taken part in – with the stunts, the set builds, everything has to be rowing in the same direction. It’s like a juggernaut. Get sleep, make sure you’re conditioned to do this gig, because it’s not an easy gig.</p>
      <p>‘I’m not being disrespectful to myself, but I’m in my 60th year and it’s tough, it’s hard, it’s relentless. It really is. It’s enjoyable, we have great fun doing it and the end product is nothing but extraordinary. You see where the money is spent and you see the expertise we have on the show and how well it is done. But you must get rest and look after yourself, or you will come unstuck, because it’s 10 months of ramming speed.’</p>
      <p>Jodie agrees when it comes to the extensive scripts she has to learn as the 13th Time Lord. ‘I would say the amount of torture it is maintaining the lines, I now know it is just torture maintaining the lines. Block one of episode one, I was like “I’m never gonna be able to learn this, it’s so hard”. But actually, it is just really hard. Go with that and be OK with that.’</p>
      <p>But while Jodie and Bradley have fatigue and brain drain to contend with, Mandip’s struggles were a bit more akin to Phoebe Buffay’s, as she revealed when asked what advice she would give to herself looking back.</p>
      <p>‘Learn how to run. I had to change my run because I watched it last year and I was like, “why am I chaffing, why is she running like that”? So this year I just keep my legs apart. I think I look better.</p>
      <p>‘Practise the hero run. From episode 10 in the last series to this one, I think I’ve smashed it.’</p>
