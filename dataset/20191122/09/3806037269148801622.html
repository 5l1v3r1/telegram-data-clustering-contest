      <p><b>Original Story(July 12, 2019):</b> <a href="https://hypebeast.com/people/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> has been shining a light on his expansive <a href="https://hypebeast.com/brands/yeezy">YEEZY</a> collection as of late, having been spotted earlier this week in what many believe to be the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/7/kanye-west-adidas-originals-yeezy-boost-350-v3-first-look">YEEZY BOOST 350 V3</a> as well as sitting down with <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/7/kanye-west-forbes-cover-story-interview"><i>Forbes</i></a> and showcasing his massive range of over 1000 adidas YEEZY prototypes.</p>
      <p>This time around West stepped out with his wife Kim Kardashian in Los Angeles sporting a new BOOST iteration. Taking on similar design cues as the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/adidas-YEEZY-BOOST-700">YEEZY BOOST 700</a> and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/adidas-YEEZY-BOOST-700-v2">700 V2</a>, many believe this to be the forthcoming 700 V3. The updated look incorporates an inner bootie system placed within a semi-translucent cage. This all then sits atop a more streamlined midsole compared to the silhouette’s prior chunky look. Additionally, a new graphic print takes over the upper, here seen in a cream and grey colorway.</p>
