      <h2>Move will lead to the creation of 200 additional jobs to the town over five years</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/charlie-taylor-7.3745954" target="_blank">Charlie Taylor</a></address>
      <p>Chinese biopharmaceutical company WuXi Biologics, which is building a €325 million plant in Dundalk, has doubled down on its investment with plans to build a $240 million (€216 million) vaccine production facility on the new campus.</p>
      <p>The move will lead to the creation of 200 additional jobs to the town over five years.</p>
      <p>A planning application for the new investment by the Hong Kong-listed group’s Wuxi Vaccines subsidiary was submitted to Louth Country Council recently.</p>
      <p>The additional investment, which is supported by <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=IDA+Ireland">IDA Ireland</a>, will bring the group’s investment locally to over €500 million and total employment on the campus to 600 by 2024.</p>
      <p>WuXi Vaccines is a joint venture between WuXi Biologics and Hile Bio-pharmaceutical. The company has entered into the strategic partnership with a global vaccine leader under which WuXi Vaccines will build a dedicated facility to exclusively supply a commercial product for the global market.</p>
      <p>Construction of the flagship WuXi Biologics contract manufacturing facility, which was announced last April, is currently underway with commercial production scheduled to start in 2021.</p>
      <p>The plant, which will employ 400 people when up and running, has been designed to be the world’s largest biologics contract manufacturing facility using single-use and flexible scale-out production technology.</p>
      <p>“We believe our ‘co-located’ WuXi Biologics and WuXi Vaccines businesses will work well together and contribute substantially to the further future growth of the WuXi Biologics Campus in Dundalk,” said chief executive Dr <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Chris+Chen">Chris Chen</a>.</p>
      <p>“This new project to exclusively manufacture a vaccine for the global market is among the first of its kind in the industry and is a further testimony to the technical strengths and premier quality which WuXi Biologics will bring to Dundalk,” he added.</p>
      <p>Minister for Business, Enterprise &amp; Innovation Heather Humphreys described the news as “a great win for the North-East and a huge vote of confidence in the local workforce”.</p>
