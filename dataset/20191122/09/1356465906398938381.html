      <h1>Hello Darkness Recap: the old friends and new at our pre-Slush networking event</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T09:03:38+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 09:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tech.eu/author/annelise-musgrove/" target="_blank">Annie Musgrove</a></address>
      <p>On Wednesday night, we kicked off Slush 2019 at <a href="https://weareepicenter.com/helsinki/">Epicenter Helsinki</a> with a great pair of partners, <a href="https://joinlafrench.tech/">La French Tech</a> and <a href="https://arcticstartup.com/">Arctic Startup</a>. Huge thanks to our speakers, everyone who came out to the event, and the Epicenter staff for a lovely evening!</p>
      <p>Before two days of <a href="https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/">Slush</a> excitement (and madness), we brought together people across the European ecosystem to mingle, listen to a few short-but-sweet talks and panels, eat some tasty Nordic bites, and raise a glass.</p>

      <p>The evening began with <b>Jean-Eric Paquet</b>, the European Commission’s director-general for research and innovation, who welcomed the crowd and gave some encouraging words about the power and potential of European tech. One of his goals at the Commission is to support entrepreneurs as they scale up from Europe. The new <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/eic/index.cfm">European Innovation Council</a>, currently in pilot mode, is proof that.</p>

      <p>Finally, a panel of three young entrepreneurs represented the energy and variety of mission-led sustainable tech in Europe.</p>

      <p><b>Marija Rucevska</b> explained the philosophy behind her startup <a href="https://kora.app/">Kora</a>, a new currency that rewards sustainable action and eco-friendly behavior. Her belief is that if we change collectively, and change how society is incentivized, then we can save the environment.</p>
      <p><b>Gaston Gyrst</b> represented <a href="https://ecotree.fr/en/">EcoTree</a>, a company that allows everyday people to invest in forestry, in tree planting and rehabilitating poorly-kept forests. Investors would own trees and be paid out eventually with logging revenues. The forest ecosystem would be healthier, and protecting the environment would be financially rewarding.</p>
      <p><b>Valentina Milanova Founder</b>, CEO of <a href="https://yourdaye.com/">Daye</a>, explained how her company has developed the first sustainable tampon. Created with cottonized hemp, which is more eco-friendly than actual cotton and contains zero plastic fibre, the Daye tampon is also infused with hemp extract (CBD) to aid pain relief.</p>
      <p>Then we all got to hang out, meet, greet, connect, share stories, make plans. Again, thanks to everyone who joined and made it possible, and hope everyone is having a happy Slush 2019.</p>
