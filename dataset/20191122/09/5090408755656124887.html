        <li>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-truck-pictures-info-details-price-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">launch of Tesla’s new Cybertruck</a> hit a speedbump on Thursday when its “armor glass” windows got smashed during a demo.</li>
        <li>CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-pickup-truck-cybertruck-reveal-how-to-watch-details-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">unveiled the $39,900 truck</a> in Los Angeles and got lead designer Franz von Holzhausen to test the windows with a metal ball.</li>
        <li>Von Holzhausen threw the ball and smashed both the front and read side windows with ease. Musk reacted: “Oh my f—–g God. Well, maybe that was a little too hard.”</li>

      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-truck-pictures-info-details-price-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">Tesla’s new Cybertruck launch</a> didn’t go quite as smoothly as expected after its “armor glass” windows got smashed during a live test.</p>
      <p>CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-truck-pictures-info-details-price-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">unveiled the $39,900 truck in Los Angeles on Thursday</a>, and got lead designer Franz von Holzhausen to test the left-side windows by throwing a silver metal ball at them.</p>
      <p>After von Holzhausen smashed the front-left window with ease, Musk exclaimed: “Oh my f—–g God. Well, maybe that was a little too hard.”</p>

      <p>“It didn’t go through, that’s a plus side,” he said.</p>
      <p>Von Halzhausen then tested the back-left window, which also smashed. “Room for improvement,” Musk joked.</p>
      <p>“We threw wrenches, we threw literally the kitchen sink at the glass and it didn’t break. For some reason it broke now… I don’t know why.”</p>

      <p>Before the hiccup, in his opening remarks Musk said: “Trucks have been the same for a very long time,” while images of conventional trucks flashed on a screen behind him.</p>
      <p>A caption on the screen read: “100 years of the same.”</p>

      <p>The Cybertruck is made of a heavy-duty exterior shell made from “ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled stainless steel” and armored glass, according to Tesla.</p>
      <p>Musk took pains to show the Cybertruck as being <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-pickup-truck-cybertruck-reveal-how-to-watch-details-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">unlike any other production passenger truck on the road</a>, punctuated by a 100-cubic-foot cargo area, and up to 14,000 pounds of towing capacity.</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck can reach 60 miles per hour in 2.9 seconds, according to Musk.</p>
