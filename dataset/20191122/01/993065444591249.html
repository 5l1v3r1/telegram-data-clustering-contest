      <p>THE chef behind Belfast's Howard Street restaurant Marty Murphy has opened a new eatery in the city centre.</p>
      <p>Ora Restaurant has opened on Great Victoria Street following a £170,000 investment, creating four new jobs. The 46-seat venue, which overlooks the Grand Opera House, features a menu influenced by global favours and food concepts.</p>
      <p>Marty Murphy said he adopted the name of his new restaurant from the Mauri word for ‘life'.</p>
      <p>“Ora was born from my love of the food experiences I encountered on my travels from Vietnam and South Africa, to Amsterdam and New Zealand,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to create an entirely new eating concept for Belfast, so the menu is packed with carefully created flavour profiles and combinations in a tapas style format with distinctive wine pairings to try.</p>
      <p>“Customers are responding really well to Ora's cosmopolitan menu and cosy setting and we are delighted to have taken bookings for over 7,000 people between both restaurants for Christmas this year.”</p>
      <p>Philip Green from First Trust Bank, which has backed the venture, said: Ora reflects Marty's passion for food and culture, and we were delighted to help bring his latest culinary vision to life. The restaurant serves a unique gap in the market, appealing to the pre-theatre crowd and also those searching for fine dining and a broad wine selection. I have supported Marty and his team for six years, from the inception of Howard St, and am delighted to now support him with this new venture.”</p>
