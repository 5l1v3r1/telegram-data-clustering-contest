      <h3>North Melbourne forward Mason Wood has made a statement early in the pre-season after being put on the trade table last month.</h3>
      <p>The 26-year-old was linked to a move to Fremantle and Sydney during the trade period, but remained on the Kangaroos’ list when the trade deadline closed.</p>
      <p>Wood returned from a trip to Vietnam on Sunday and reported back to pre-season training on Monday morning, before taking out the 2km time-trial at Arden Street on Friday.</p>

      <p>Midfielder Trent Dumont built a massive lead early in the run before Wood picked off the South Australian with 200m to go, with former Port Adelaide half-back Jasper Pittard rounding out the top three.</p>
      <p>Despite being dropped late last season, Wood played 18 games in 2019 – five more than his previous best – and kicked 21 goals, including an equal career-high four majors against eventual premiers Richmond.</p>
      <p>Wood said the trade speculation has forced him to reconsider the way he approaches his preparation. And for the endurance machine, that has been the way he structures his days.</p>

      <p>"It was very strange initially, but after the first couple of days you realise this is footy and you have to take it for what it is and see what the best options are for me and work that out," Wood told reporters at Arden Street on Friday.</p>
      <p>"That was to stay here, so I'm very happy to be here. It maybe makes you question where you're at and maybe change a few things up that you do.</p>
      <p>“That was probably the biggest thing for me. Just how I set up my day and being a little more run to schedule and really blocking out times for things I find are important, instead of just saying I'll get to them at the end of the day and maybe doing them a bit half-arsed. “</p>

      <p>Time management has been a theme of the pre-season so far under new coach Rhyce Shaw, who took over the reins from Brad Scott midway through last season before landing the role on a permanent basis at the start of August.</p>
      <p>An electronic screen sits above the ground counting down the minutes before the session starts. Anyone who is late is not allowed to train. While a similar rule has been introduced with all meetings. Tardiness won’t be tolerated under Shaw.</p>
      <p>“Rhyce is big on the little things and how they all add up. That starts with the clock and a few other things,” Wood said.</p>
      <p>“We have (done those things in the past) but now there is an absolute policy on all that kind of stuff. Make it easy when you’ve got a clock telling you how long you’ve got.”</p>

      <p>While Wood didn’t find his way to another club during the trade period, the Kangaroos acquired former first-round pick Aiden Bonar from Greater Western Sydney in the final moments of the trade period.</p>
      <p>Despite having two years to run on a contract at the Giants, the opportunity starved midfielder found his way to Arden Street, along with a future fourth-round pick in exchange for a future third-round pick, which could prove to be a steal.</p>
      <p>Wood said the senior group has been impressed by the way the Dandenong Stingrays product – who managed only six games in two seasons at the Giants – has turned up for pre-season.</p>
      <p>“Just looking at him, he is such a physical specimen. We’re really excited to see what he can do going into next year,” he said.</p>
      <p>“He is really good mates with Luke Davies-Uniacke. They are already starting to jell and they’re in each other’s pocket, which is good.”</p>
