      <p>China Stats Bureau revises 2018 GDP higher by 2.1%.</p>
      <h3>Key note</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The revision will not have any major impact on 2019 GDP growth.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>China routinely revises its annual GDP data, typically making a final revision at the end of the calendar year. While the revisions typically have no immediate bearing on policy, some analysts see other implications for longer-term economic targets if past estimates are revised higher. "Analysts expect GDP growth to slow to 6.2% this year as domestic demand softened and a Sino-U.S. trade war persisted," - Reuters.Â  USD/CNY is unchanged on the news, -0.03%</p>
