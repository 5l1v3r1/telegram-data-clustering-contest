      <h1>The Mandalorian’s Dave Filoni Endorses “Baby Yoda” Name</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:33:59+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:33</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>By now,  it’s clear that there’s a new breakout <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars"><b>Star Wars</b></a> character in Disney+’s <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-mandalorian"><b>The Mandalorian </b></a>— “Baby Yoda.” It’s definitely not confirmed whether this small creature has any relation to the Jedi master. But he have a similar appearance, and that led to his instantly meme-worthy moniker. </p>
      <p>Dave Filoni, who directed the debut episode of the series, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt4H_7ZCqZs&amp;feature=emb_title">recently spoke to Entertainment Tonight</a> about <b>The Mandalorian</b>. He also believes it’s “very clear” why fans consider this character “Baby Yoda.”</p>
      <p>“They don’t know yet, that’s fine,” said Filoni. He added that the baby’s backstory was “all part of the mystery.”</p>

      <p>At this point in the series (two episodes in), Baby Yoda doesn’t have a name. Or we simply haven’t learned his name yet. That may throw a few fans off considering the baby is 50 years old, as noted in the first episode. </p>
      <p>The third episode of <b>The Mandalorian</b> will hit Disney+ after midnight tonight. Based on a <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tv/471385-disney-sets-the-mandalorians-release-dates-and-episode-synopses">previously posted synopsis</a>, the lead character will collect a reward for his bounty. The first season will continue with new episodes premiering each Friday through December.</p>
