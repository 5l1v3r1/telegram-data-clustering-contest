      <h1>FBI official under investigation for allegedly altering document in Russia probe: report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:07:23+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rachel-frazin" target="_blank">Rachel Frazin</a></address>
      <p>An FBI official is being investigated after allegedly altering a document connected to surveillance of a 2016 Trump campaign aide, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/politics/fbi-fisa-russia-investigation/index.html">CNN reported</a> Thursday, citing people briefed on the matter. </p>
      <p>The alleged altering was reportedly discovered as part of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's probe into whether the FBI followed the law and its own policies while applying for a warrant to surveil a former Trump campaign official Carter Page during the 2016 election. </p>
      <p>Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/lindsey-graham">Lindsey Graham</a> (R-S.C.) said this week that a report of Horowitz's findings was <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/471431-graham-doj-watchdog-report-on-alleged-surveillance-abuse-in-2016-to-be">expected to be released Dec. 9</a>. </p>
      <p>CNN reported that Horowitz gave the allegedly changed document to <a href="https://thehill.com/people/john-durham">John Durham</a>, who is leading an investigation into the origins of the government's Russia probe. The document is one focus of Durham's criminal investigation, according to the news network. </p>
      <p>Sources told CNN that a witness admitted to the change after being confronted by Horowitz's team about the document. Whether the FBI employee still works for the bureau and the person's rank and identity are reportedly unknown. </p>
      <p>It is also reportedly unknown whether the document in question played a significant role in the investigation of Page. </p>
      <p>The inspector general's office in March 2018 announced that it would review the FBI's compliance with surveillance requirements amid Republican claims that there was an abuse of power relating to the monitoring of <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a>’s 2016 campaign.</p>
      <p>The Hill has reached out to the Justice Department and FBI for comment. </p>
