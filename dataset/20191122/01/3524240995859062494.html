      <h1>Podolski to open Kebab business in Poland</h1>

      <p><b>Lukas Podolski </b>is edging closer to fulfilling his long-held promise to play for Polish side Gornik Zabrze, the club he supported as a child.</p>
      <p>The 2014 German World Cup winner is said to be in talks over a return to his birth place in January once his contract with Japanese side Vissel Kobe expires.</p>
      <p>Podolski was born in the town of Gliwice, which is located next to Zabrze, and has regularly spoke about ending his career with the club.</p>
      <p>According to Polish newspaper Przeglad Sportowy, Podolski is now in negotiations with Gornik Zabrze over a move in January.</p>
      <p>Podolski has a contract with Vissel Kobe until January 31, 2020 and will then be available to make an emotional return to Poland.</p>
      <p>However, speaking about a possible move to Poland last year, Podolski remained coy on the matter.</p>
      <p>He said, ‘I don’t say no, but many factors have to happen here.’</p>
      <p>It is claimed Gornik Zabrze are aware this could be their best chance to lure Podolski to the club with his contract in Japan winding down.</p>
      <p>Podolski left Poland for Germany at the age of two, going on to win 130 caps for Die Mannschaft. He still has strong ties to Poland though and is said to regularly visit family there.</p>
      <p>As well as bringing sporting benefits to the city, Podolski is also reportedly planning on bringing his successful food businesses to Zabrze too.</p>
