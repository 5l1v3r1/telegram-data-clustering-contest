      <h1>UEFA charge Belgium over Boyata, Batshuayi mixup</h1>

      <p><b>Belgium</b> have been charged by UEFA after Dedryck Boyata wore Michy Batshuayi’s shirt for part of their European Qualifier against Russia on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Boyata, who was officially named on the team sheet as No 4, appeared for the second half with the correctly numbered shorts but combined with Batshuayi’s No 23 top.</p>
      <p>Players sometimes change into a fresh shirt at half-time and <i>Sky Sports News</i> has been told that Boyata mistakenly picked up the wrong one in the changing room.</p>
      <p>The error was not spotted by Belgium’s backroom staff until some time after the teams kicked off and the former Celtic and Manchester City defender only switched back to his assigned number in the 57th minute.</p>
      <p>The Belgian FA has been charged under article 43 (1) of the competition regulations which state: ‘Before each match, each team shall indicate in the relevant match sheet the numbers, full names, dates of birth and, if applicable, shirt names of the 23 players in the squad’.</p>
      <p>Belgium have also been handed a ‘delayed kick-off’ charge relating to the same game but there is no confirmation whether this is related to the shirt error.</p>
