        <b>Gareth Bale’s actions after Wales qualified for Euro 2020 caused uproar in Spain, and the Real Madrid forward’s agent responded.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gareth Bale’s agent Jonathan Barnett said the Real Madrid star’s “WALES. GOLF. MADRID… IN THAT ORDER” flag celebration was “meant for the media” amid backlash.</p>
      <p>Bale caused a stir in Cardiff on Tuesday, when he was pictured laughing and celebrating in front of a fan-made banner after Wales qualified for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Tipped to leave Madrid and criticised for his priorities amid his love for golf, Wales fans have adopted the chant, “Wales, golf, Madrid”, which was heard during the international break.</p>
      <p>Spanish newspaper Marca’s frontpage on Thursday read: “DISRESPECTFUL. WRONG. UNGRATEFUL. IN THAT ORDER”.</p>
      <p>But speaking to ESPN, Barnett insisted there were “no worries” for Bale ahead of his return to Madrid.</p>
      <p>Bale, who has not featured for Madrid since October, is set to appear for the club’s LaLiga meeting against Real Sociedad at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old has scored two goals in seven appearances across all competitions this season.</p>
