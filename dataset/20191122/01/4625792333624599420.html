      <p><b>ATLANTA, Georgia —</b> The speech, which Elizabeth Warren's campaign took great pains to tease the legacy of black female domestic workers in the United States, was almost drowned out by a group of mostly black protesters.</p>
      <p>"There are fighters who were here before, fighters we can learn from, and the fighters I want to talk about tonight are black women," the Massachusetts senator and front-runner for the 2020 presidential nomination said before pro-school choice demonstrators interrupted her for a sustained period of time.</p>
      <p>The protesters, wearing shirts with the phrase, "Powerful Parents Network," chanted, "Our children, our choice!" and, “We want to be heard!" Their shouts were met with counter chants of, "Warren!" and, "Let her speak!"</p>
      <p>Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley, who introduced Warren at historically black institution Clark Atlanta University, came back on stage to help placate the group, inviting to meet with them after the rally to listen to their concerns.</p>
      <p>"No one is here to quiet you, least of all this black woman," the congresswoman said. "The senator is here to talk about the contribution fighters like you have made in history."</p>
      <p>Warren's address recounted how black washerwomen went on strike in 1881 to advocate for domestic worker rights. It came as she tries to appeal to the important Democratic voting bloc, a constituency she has struggled to connect with so far this primary race.</p>
      <p>"The lessons of history will live in every part of my presidency — and I will ask you to hold me accountable to those lessons every single day," she said.</p>
      <p>Her speech echoes her retelling of <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/warren-trump-is-corruption-in-the-flesh">Frances Perkins' response to the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire</a> during a rally in New York City in September.</p>
