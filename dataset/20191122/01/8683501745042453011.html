      <p>Whatever your feelings are about <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485270/reactions-to-the-new-cats-trailer-are-just-as-classic-this-time-around">the fever dream that is the upcoming <i>Cats</i> movie</a>, you might have assumed that it cost a pretty penny to make its starring actors <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483795/ian-mckellen-defends-cats-viral-cgi">look like freakish humanoid feline hybrids</a> and create those unusual sets. According to a new report, not only would you be correct with that assessment, you probably undershot the total cost, as allegedly <i>Cats</i>’ budget nearly reached $300 million.</p>
      <p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/21/film-trailer-cats-ts-eliot">The Guardian</a>, <i>Cats</i> is estimated of having a budget of around £230 million, which converts to approximately $297 million. Now keep in mind, this number is by no means official, so don’t go touting it as such just yet. It’s usually after a movie comes out that its budget is unveiled, though there’s no guarantee that’ll happen with <i>Cats</i>.</p>
      <p>But if this is correct, Universal certainly spared no expense with its <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485125/new-cats-trailer-just-dropped-bring-on-the-wild-internet-cgi-comments">cinematic adaptation of the popular Andrew Lloyd Webber musical</a>, which in turn was inspired by the 1939 poetry collection <i>Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats</i> by T.S. Eliot. Interestingly enough, it still wouldn’t rank as the most expensive movie ever made.</p>
      <p>Thus far the movie that’s come with the biggest price tag is 2011’s <i>Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides</i>, with the adjusted total adding up to around $378.5 million. If <i>Cats</i> did indeed cost around $297 million to make, that would rank it at sixth place on the adjusted for inflation list, trailing behind 2007’s <i>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End</i> and <i>Justice League</i>, both of which cost around $300 million, and 2018’s <i>Solo: A Star Wars Story</i>, which cost somewhere between $275 million, and that’s not even accounting for post-production work.</p>
      <p>Needless to say that Universal took a big risk if it dropped that much money on <i>Cats</i>. For one thing, while it’s been a Broadway mainstay for decades, <i>Cats</i> isn’t necessarily an incredibly popular property to the general public. Even more important, it’s opening the same day as <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485403/jj-abrams-reveals-why-the-rise-of-skywalker-really-felt-like-the-end-of-star-wars"><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i></a>, which we can logically assume will draw in a lot of people and likely be crowned the box office king that weekend.</p>
      <p>Again, we don’t know for sure if $297 million is <i>Cats</i>’ finalized budget, but even if it’s more in $200-$250 million territory, it’ll be an uphill battle for Universal to break even on this one, let alone make a profit. Still, <i>Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle</i> opened opposite <i>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</i> two years ago and it <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2314292/jumanji-welcome-to-the-jungle-just-passed-a-huge-milestone">became a surprise commercial hit</a>. Maybe <i>Cats</i> will end up following suit.</p>
      <p>Directed by Tom Hooper, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Lee Hall, <i>Cats</i> follows a tribe of felines called the Jellicles over the course of a single night as they decide which among them will ascend to the Heavenside Layer and be reborn. Its all-star cast includes James Corden, Judi Dench, Idris Elba, Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellen, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484934/hear-taylor-swifts-new-song-from-cats">Taylor Swift</a>, Jason Derulo, Rebel Wilson and newcomer Francesca Hayward.</p>
      <p><i>Cats</i> opens in theaters on December 20, and if you’re curious about what other movies are coming out before the year is over, look through our <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2456842/new-movie-releases-2019-movie-release-date-schedule">2019 release schedule</a>.</p>
