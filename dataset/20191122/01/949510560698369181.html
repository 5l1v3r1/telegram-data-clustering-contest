      <p>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — A former CIA officer who pleaded guilty to an espionage conspiracy with China could be facing more than two decades in prison.</p>
      <p>Fifty-five-year-old Jerry Chun Shing Lee is scheduled for sentencing Friday in federal court in Alexandria.</p>
      <p>He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage, but prosecutors and defense lawyers disagree about the extent of the crime.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say Chinese intelligence officers gave Lee more than $840,000 and that Lee likely gave them all the information he had from a 13-year career as a CIA case officer. They are seeking a prison term of more than 20 years.</p>
      <p>Defense lawyers say the government never proved that the money came from China or that Lee ever carried out any plans to deliver government secrets. They’re asking for a 10-year sentence.</p>
