      <p>Softbank, fresh from its $9 billion bail-out of WeWork, which followed a $10 billion investment in the company, is  reported to be seeking a $2.76 billion loan from three Japanese banks.</p>
      <p>The banks –  Mizuho, Mitsubishi and Sumitomo Mitsui  – are, reportedly, concerned about lending to Softbank because some have lent to Softbank before and the banks have  also invested in Softbank’s Vision Fund which took a hit in value from WeWork’s aborted IPO.</p>
      <p>Softbank is  said to have a $100 billion stake in Alibaba – but doubts have been raised about how potentially liquid that  investment might be.</p>
      <p>The last time Softbank sold Alibaba stock was in 2016 to fund the acquisition of Arm. It was another three years,  in June 2019, before the cash from the sale was booked as a profit in Softbank’s accounts.</p>
      <p>The Alibaba share sale was done in a curiously piecemeal way. $5-6 billion was by a private placement, $2 billion was raised from selling shares back to Alibaba, $400 million was raised by selling shares to Alibaba execs and $500 million came from a sale to an unidentified sovereign wealth fund.</p>
      <p>The complexity of the deal, and the time it took to do it, suggests that liquidating its Alibaba share stake is not entirely straightforward.</p>
      <p>It is the Alibaba stake that has underpinned Softbank’s ability to borrow massively to fund its investment programme.</p>
      <p>The last time Softbank  looked for a loan was in May this year when it tried to raise $4 billion from Goldman Sachs among others secured against part of its investment portfolio.</p>
      <p>Last week Softbank reported a $6.4 billion loss largely due to downwards revaluations of its investments.</p>
