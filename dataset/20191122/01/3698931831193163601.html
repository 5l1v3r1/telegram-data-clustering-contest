      <h1>Honor MagicBook laptops are coming to Malaysia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:28:20+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/alexwnl/" target="_blank">Alexander Wong</a></address>
      <p>Honor actually makes more than just smartphones and fitness bands. In China, they have a wide variety of products including <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/09/26/huawei-honor-vision-pro-harmony-os-smart-tv-iot/">Smart TVs</a>, <a href="https://www.honor.cn/productsearch/home-internet-media/">Smart Home devices</a> and even Laptops. To expand its portfolio, Honor Malaysia will be introducing its range of MagicBook laptops in our market very soon.</p>

      <p>During the launch of the Honor 9X, we managed to get a quick look at the new MagicBook. In terms of design, it looks very similar to Huawei’s <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/my/laptops/matebook-d-14/">MateBook D 14</a> but they have added some touches to make it uniquely different. On the cover, you get a nice “HONOR” logo in blue while the chamfered edges are coloured blue as well.</p>

      <p>Honor hasn’t revealed its full specs just yet but we can tell that this is a 14″ laptop that runs on an AMD Ryzen 5 series. Strangely, we can’t seem to find this exact model on Honor China’s <a href="https://www.honor.cn/productsearch/tablets/">website</a>.</p>
      <p>It comes with a well spaced-out chiclet keyboard and a fairly large trackpad at the bottom. There’s also a hidden pop-up webcam placed between the F6 and F7 key. Also included is HonorLink which allows you to transfer files by simply tapping your phone on the NFC sticker. This is similar to Huawei Share OneHop feature.</p>
      <p>The overall build is quite solid and it feels quite heavy at around 1.3-1.6kg. The MagicBook charges via USB-C and it also comes with 2 USB-A ports, an HDMI port and a headphone jack.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Honor Malaysia has not revealed any availability details for the MagicBook and we think it should be arriving sometime in 2020.</p>
