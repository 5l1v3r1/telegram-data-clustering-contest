      <h1>Undefeated Champion Boxer Floyd Mayweather Announces He’s Retiring</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:26:25+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:26</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Floyd Mayweather, who can be argued as one of the best pound for pound boxers who has ever lived, has seemingly retired from the sport yet again.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mayweather-says-done-brutal-sport-180324911.html">Reuters</a>, the undefeated fighter with a record of 50-0, stated that he is more concerned about his health than getting back into the ring.</p>
      <blockquote>“I’ve got calls to get back into the ring, but my health is my wealth,” Mayweather said to Reuters. “Boxing is a very, very brutal sport. In the last few years a lot of fighters have died inside that squared circle.”</blockquote>
      <p>Mayweather is likely talking about the rash of boxers who have died just in 2019 alone to ring related injuries, with Patrick Day being one of the latest last month.</p>
      <blockquote>“You have got to know when to hang it up. I had a great career,” he shared with the news outlet.<br/><br/>“I’ll still travel and do exhibitions. I make great money doing exhibitions — between $10 [million] and $30 million,” he said. “I think I make more doing that than most fighters make fighting.”</blockquote>
      <p>Mayweather last fought in the United States against Conor McGregor, with earned him a reported $300 million.</p>
      <p>On New Year’s Eve, he had a 3-round exhibition against a professional kickboxer that didn’t last very long.</p>
      <blockquote>“Eventually I will move on to build my brand in MMA, but for right now I’m in boxing and boxing will always be at the top as long as I’m involved,” Mayweather said.<br/><br/>“My career went great,” he said. “I’m happy with how everything played out.”</blockquote>
