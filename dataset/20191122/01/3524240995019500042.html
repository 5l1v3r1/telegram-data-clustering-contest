      <h1>Bayern to appoint Pochettino in January</h1>

      <p><b>Bayern Munich</b> will reportedly appoint Mauricio Pochettino as the club’s permanent coach over the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The Argentine, who spent five years at Tottenham Hotspur, was sacked by the North London club on Wednesday following a poor start to the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
      <p>It was announced soon after that Jose Mourinho had become the new Spurs boss, with the Portuguese taking his first training session on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>According to <i>AS</i>, Pochettino’s removal has piqued the interest of Bayern, who view the manager as a top target.</p>
      <p>Bayern are on the search for a new permanent boss after the club dispensed with Niko Kovac earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The Bundesliga champions have already confirmed that interim coach Hansi Flick will remain in charge at the Allianz Arena until Christmas at least.</p>
