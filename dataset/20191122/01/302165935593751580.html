      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 22 — The ringgit opened marginally higher against the US dollar today driven by a more optimistic sentiment on the US-China trade negotiation, making the ringgit slightly more appealing to investors, dealers said.</p>
      <p>At 9am, the ringgit was trading at 4.1670/1700 against the greenback from yesterday’s close of 4.1680/1710.</p>
      <p>Axi Trader Asia-Pacific market strategist Stephen Innes said confidence on the US-China trade deal was tapering over gloomy regional economic data, especially from China.</p>
      <p>“The shift on trade deal confidence may have turned currency focus back to the economic realities, and without a domestic growth, trade deal optimism alone is not enough to carry the day.</p>
      <p>“While short term price action will like trade biased to trade war euphoria for the longer-term views, it is back to the basics around the economic data,” Innes said in a note.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the local note also fared better against other major currencies.</p>
      <p>The ringgit went up against the Singapore dollar at 3.0577/0610 from 3.0607/0633 yesterday and appreciated against the yen to 3.8349/8387 from 3.8404/8435.</p>
      <p>The local note rose against the euro to 4.6091/6141 from 4.6202/6252 and gained vis-a-vis the British pound to 5.3813/3864 from 5.3946/3002. — Bernama</p>
