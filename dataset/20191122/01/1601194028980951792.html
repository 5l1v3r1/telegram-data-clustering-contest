      <p>This past Wednesday's episode of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">NXT</a> was an exciting, hard-hitting affair- definitely wheting fans' appetites for action before this weekend's PPV events. That intense performing came at a price, however, as two high-profile tag team Superstars from the Black &amp; Gold brand suffered injuries.</p>
      <p>These reports come to us from WWE's NXT Injury Report on YouTube, hosted by Matt Camp, which you can watch below (<a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/wwe-announces-injuries-to-bobby-fish-and-wesley-blake-662501">h/t to Wrestling Inc.</a>).</p>

      <h4>Not the face! Not the face!</h4>
      <p>NXT Tag Team Champion Bobby Fish, of the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/undisputed-era">Undisputed Era</a>, was reported to have suffered nose and facial lacerations during their extremely intense match against The Revival. According to reports, Fish will meet with a plastic surgeon for a consultation, but he'll still be participating in both PPV events this weekend.</p>
      <p>Another individual who took some damage to the front side of their head was Forgotten Sons member and a former NXT Tag Team Champion himself, Wesley Blake. He also suffered facial lacerations during the Sons' match with RAW Tag Team Champions The Viking Raiders, and will <i>also</i> follow up with a doctor to get those taken care of. However, it also looks like he won't be on the shelf at all, either.</p>
      <p>Sportskeeda wishes a speedy recovery to both of these gentlemen.</p>
