      <h1>Wellington Turman gained ‘many followers’ after beating ‘The Joker’ at UFC Sao Paulo</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author">Guilherme Cruz, https://facebook.com/guicruzmma/</a></address>
      <p>SAO PAULO, Brazil — <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4280/markus-perez">Markus Perez</a> dressed up as “The Joker” and became the biggest star of the <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1055/ufc-fight-night-sao-paulo">UFC Sao Paulo</a> ceremonial weigh-ins on Friday, but <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/5004/wellington-turman">Wellington Turman</a> got the last laugh on fight night.</p>
      <p>Turman was looking for his first UFC win after dropping a split decision to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4183/karl-roberson">Karl Roberson</a> in his debut, and he defeated Perez via unanimous decision in an entertaining affair in Perez’s hometown.</p>
      <p>“What he did (Friday) was funny,” Turman said after the win. “It was amazing because he gave me many followers and brought more attention to my name. People were talking a lot about him on Friday, but tonight they will talk about me because I went there and showed all that was for nothing [laughs]. Turman has arrived to save Gotham.</p>
      <p>“Pick a character that wins next time… Good always beats evil.”</p>

      <p>During the fight, Turman says he told Perez to “hit harder.”</p>
      <p>“I was talking some trash at him because he did all that show on Friday, so I had to do my part tonight.</p>
      <p>“He landed many unexpected strikes on me, but I have a hard chin and I can take it. I spar with (UFC fighter <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2252/augusto-sakai">Augusto) Sakai</a>, who’s a heavyweight. That won’t affect me. But I think I had the control of the fight, I was able to land the better strikes, I was able to take him down and dominate. He definitely wasn’t smiling tonight [laughs].”</p>
      <p>Turman also revealed what he told Perez during the face-off at the ceremonial weigh-ins.</p>
      <p>“He looked at me and said, ‘Why so serious?’” Turman said. “I looked at him and said, ‘I’m Batman and I’m going to beat you [laughs].’ He picked a character that is a loser. It was really funny when he showed up with that (at the weigh-ins), and that gave me a lot of media, but I was already prepared to say (the Joker always loses) in the end.”</p>
