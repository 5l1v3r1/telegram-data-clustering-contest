      <p>Material possessions, such as cars and clothing decrease in value soon after buying them, but as first impressions count, it can be important to invest in looking good.</p>
      <p>Living in New Zealand no longer limits access to fashion as online shopping options continue to increase. High competition allows people to shop around - and that includes looking at second-hand clothing to help both the environment and the back pocket.</p>
      <p>Newshub spoke to a style consultant and the manager of Recycle Boutique for tips on how to look good for less.</p>

      <p>For people wanting to curb their spending on clothes, Jackie O'Fee, owner of Signature Style, said there's never been a better time.</p>
      <p>"My top tip for looking stylish on a budget is to buy less and wear clothing more.   </p>
      <p>"Shops such as BooHoo, ASOS, BNKR and Topshop have current season looks at great prices."</p>
      <p>Although the challenge is finding quality clothing at good prices, many online retailers have upped their game on returns.</p>
      <p>O'Fee says that people should head straight to the 'sale' tab on designer websites - or pound the pavement and visit sale racks for bargains.</p>
      <p>"The Global Financial Crisis changed the way we shop and the way retail works, as retail chains [usually] have some form of offer.</p>
      <p>"Garments on sale racks are often unsold as they have no 'hanger appeal', but as clothes are made for bodies - they come to life when worn.</p>
      <p>"Try them on," O'Fee urges.</p>
      <h3>Buying in second-hand stores</h3>
      <p>As a society, we're slowly coming around to supporting the environment and local second hand clothing stores are an ideal place to go.</p>
      <p>"[From second-hand stores], people can create a unique look that's carefully curated, rather than purchased in stores the same as their peers," O'Fee said.</p>
      <p>Mark Cowie, general manager at the Recycle Boutique, said that now, people are much more in tune with sustainable fashion, which is fuelling demand for second-hand items and causing people to re-evaluate how they buy.  </p>
      <p>"Statistics show that second-hand clothing will be larger than fast fashion within ten years," Cowie said.</p>
      <p>"[Within the Recycle Boutique], American vintage is a popular section  and we [regularly stock labels such as] Karen Walker, Ruby, Ralph Lauren, Moochi, Sass and Bide and Tommy Hilfiger," Cowie added. </p>
      <p>In addition to helping the environment by reducing landfill, the draw-card to buying second-hand are the huge savings on retail costs.</p>
      <p>"At Recycle, [clothing is] generally a third of the retail price. </p>
      <p>"It's better for the environment and [shoppers are] supporting the local community of recyclers. </p>
      <p>"We encourage a circular fashion economy: if [people] buy something, [we suggest they] make way for it in their wardrobe by selling something else," Cowie suggested.</p>
      <h3>Figure-flattering style tips</h3>
      <p>As every piece of clothing is unique and doesn't suit every body, O'Fee suggests that people dress with this in mind.</p>
      <p>"Print [styles] hide figure challenges, [the material] stays cleaner longer and is more interesting.</p>
      <p>"Wear a print that suits you: if you're petite, wear a smaller print or curvy figures can go larger," O'Fee advised.</p>
      <p>Another style tip when adding colour is to go lighter or place prints to draw the eye to certain areas. </p>
      <p>"[To balance] larger thighs [for example], wear print on top and keep the bottom half simple."</p>
      <p>People who lack in waist definition should avoid large tight belts and choose clothing that creates shape through the torso.</p>
      <p>"Tailored blazers, fit and flare dresses are examples of [good choices]," O'Fee added.</p>
      <p>The modern workplace is ditching the suit and tie in favour of 'smart casual' - however, there's a subtle difference to the type of clothing people typically wear out with friends.</p>
      <p>"Choose work clothes with a degree of formality," O'Fee suggests.</p>
      <p>"[Choose] more formal jackets, tailored trousers and slightly longer skirts."</p>
      <p>When putting the total look together, the small things shouldn't be forgotten.</p>
      <p>"Don't forget the finishing touches, such as jewellery and the right shoe: don't undermine a great outfit by neglecting these," O'Fee advised.</p>
      <p>Environmentally-conscious people having a wardrobe cleanout ahead of summer are advised to mend, upcycle, give clothing away - or use the material to make something new.</p>
      <p>As online shopping and second-hand clothing provide the option to try out different looks, whilst comparing prices and spending less, for people wanting to look stylish for less, there's never been a better time.</p>
