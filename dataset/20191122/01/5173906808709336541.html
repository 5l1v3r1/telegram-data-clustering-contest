        <b>Portugal’s National Republican Guard (GNR) reported 41,868 elderly people living alone or isolated throughout the country in October as part of the “Senior Census” operation.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a statement, the GNR said it had reported 215 situations of greater vulnerability to the competent authorities, especially social support.<br/>Another 4,274 elderly people received support from other institutions, which are not specified by GNR.</p>
      <p>According to the data, the largest number of identified elderly living alone or isolated was in the district of Vila Real (4,736), followed by Guarda (4,183), Faro (3,272), Viseu (3,201), Portalegre (3,147) and Bragança (3,142).</p>
      <p>In Lisbon, 626 elderly people were identified living alone or isolated and in Porto, 1,026.</p>
      <p>In the operation “Senior Census 2019”, carried out in October, the GNR reported elderly who live alone and/or isolated or in a vulnerable situation due to their physical, psychological or other condition that may put their safety at risk.</p>
      <p>During the operation, the military gave priority to personal contact and the carrying out of actions, to raise awareness among this target audience so that they do not adopt risky behaviours, preventing them from becoming victims of crimes, such as theft, robbery or scams.</p>
      <p>The first “Operation Senior Census” took place in 2011 and, since then, GNR has been building a geographic database to provide better support to the elderly population.</p>
      <p>In October 2018, the GNR had flagged 45,563 elderly people living alone or isolated throughout the country.</p>
