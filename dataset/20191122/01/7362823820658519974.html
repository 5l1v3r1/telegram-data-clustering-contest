      <p>“The cause of the crash is under investigation, however preliminary reports do not indicate it was caused by enemy fire,” the statement read.</p>
      <p>However, A<a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/11/21/pentagon-ids-two-soldiers-killed-in-afghanistan-helicopter-crash/">rmy Times</a> reported the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/taliban-deal-dead-what-comes-next-for-the-u-s-in-afghanistan">Taliban</a> claimed it had shot down a helicopter in Logar Province.</p>
      <p>Both men deployed to the region last month. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Thursday in an unannounced visit to watch the flagged-draped caskets with the two soldiers arrive in the United States.</p>

      <p>Knadle joined the Army in April 2013. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, Air Medal and Army Achievement Medal. Fuchigami also earned awards including the Bronze Star Medal, Air Medal and the National Defense Service Medal and joined the Army in May 2017.</p>
      <p>Camarano said the pair will “always be remembered as a part of the heroic legacy of the 1st Cavalry Division; forged by the sacrifices of brave Cavalry Troopers who have laid down their lives in defense of freedom.”</p>
