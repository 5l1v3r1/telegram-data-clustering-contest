      <h1>Here’s Myles Garrett Hinting Mason Rudolph Said A Racial Slur To Him During Postgame Interview After TNF Brawl (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>Myles Garrett’s violent response to Mason Rudolph during their incident had people thinking something else may have went on besides emotions getting out of control. ESPN’s Josina Anderson took to Twitter and stated that Garrett would probably say Mason Rudolph said something egregious to him, but would later delete that tweet.</p>
      <p>After it came out that the Cleveland Browns defensive end accused Rudolph of calling him a racial slur, most people wondered why it would take so long for him to say something if that’s in fact what happened.</p>
      <p>As it turned out, Garrett was actually asked after the game if Rudolph said something to cause this, and his response tells you somebody told him to keep quiet about it, but there was definitely something said there.</p>
      <p>“Did Mason say something, is that what started things?” he was asked.</p>
      <p>“They just gotta go look at it, and I’m not going to comment on it,” Garrett said.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, there were no players mic’d up for this game, so this will just fall under the category of who you choose to believe in this scenario.</p>
