      <h1>This New Netflix Show Is Like The Reality TV Version Of 'Crazy Rich Asians'</h1>

      <p>With <i>Crazy Rich Asians </i>becoming the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/crazy-rich-asians-box-office-rom-com-record_n_5ba932afe4b0375f8f9f8ce4">highest grossing romantic film</a> in a decade, it was only a matter of time before other studios tried to replicate its success. Netflix's offering of Singaporean glitz and glamour comes in the form of <i>Singapore Social</i>, a reality TV show about a group of affluent young Singaporeans. However, if <a href="https://sg.asiatatler.com/society/netflix-new-reality-show-singapore-social-cast-members"><i>Singapore Social </i>wants to<i><u> </u></i>return for Season 2</a> or even come close to matching the phenomenon of <i>CRA</i>, it will need to win over fans — and early detractors.</p>
      <p><i>Singapore Social </i>is like <i>Keeping Up with the Kardashians </i>mixed with <i>The Hills</i> and <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>, featuring romance, family drama, and the clash between Asian traditions and modernity. It boasts a relatively high-profile and multiracial cast, following creatives such as burlesque dancer Sukki Singapora, actor Paul Foster, and singer Tabita Nauser as they move through their respective ultra-glam spheres.</p>
      <p>While Netflix boasts an impressive library of Asian dramas and Asian reality TV shows, <i>Singapore Social </i>is one of the first series to feel like it's aimed at a predominantly English-speaking audience, as <i>Crazy Rich Asians </i>ultimately was. That saddles <i>Singapore Social </i>with a host of unique issues when it comes to representation; before Season 1 aired, the show was already being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxLzDjZ5HFI&amp;t=22s">downvoted on YouTube</a> by Singaporeans who felt that this privileged group of people did little to reflect the reality of living in Singapore.</p>

      <p>"A show about Singaporeans where nobody actually lives as a normal Singaporean," YouTube commenter Jamilah Lim critiqued. Another user agreed, writing that the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxLzDjZ5HFI">leads of <i>Singapore Social</i></a><i> </i>are essentially the one percent and don't "represent the majority of Singaporeans living here."</p>
      <p>To put it in perspective, <i>Time </i>magazine reports that one in 34 people in <a href="https://time.com/5360699/crazy-rich-asians-singapore-economy/">Singapore are millionaires</a>, and Singapore is the sixth most millionaire-dense country in the world. The answer for why it's the home to the ultra rich is essentially British colonization: in 1819, the British arrived and negotiated a treaty with the local tribes to create a new major trading port. By 1867, the British crown had taken control of Singapore entirely, and many wealthy immigrants from Europe and China flocked to the city-state that boasted the best trading in the world.</p>
      <p>It's understandable, then, that some native Singaporeans feel that <i>Singapore Social </i>doesn't capture their lived experiences, as cities with concentrated wealth often also have issues of income inequality. Singapore is "a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/singapore/568567/">largely middle-class country</a> where most people live in public housing (Singapore's solution to the housing-cost problem that blights San Francisco)," writes Kwame Anthony Appiah for <i>The Atlantic.</i> This is why portrayals of Singapore as <i>only </i>home to the wealthy <a href="https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/8/17/17715124/crazy-rich-asians-movie-singapore">draws criticism from those who live there</a>, and why <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/21/where-are-the-brown-people-crazy-rich-asians-draws-tepid-response-in-singapore"><i>Crazy Rich Asians </i>didn't perform well in Singapore</a>.</p>
      <p>That's not to say that it's impossible for <i>Singapore Social </i>to find a dedicated fanbase on Netflix: it's not far off from all the frothy American reality TV shows centered around the lives of rich celebs. And when it comes to representation in America, <i>Singapore Social </i>does add diversity to the <a href="https://socialsciences.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/UCLA-Hollywood-Diversity-Report-2019-2-21-2019.pdf">reality TV genre, which is still predominantly white</a>. But if <i>Singapore Social </i>wants to win over native Singaporeans, it may have to feature characters who aren't just, you know, crazy rich.</p>
