      <p>A PRIEST honoured by President Michael D Higgins yesterday for his charity work is facing a lawsuit alleging he sexually abused an American teenager 40 years ago.</p>
      <p>Fr Bernard Lynch, who grew up in Ennis, Co Clare, was due to collect his Distinguished Service Award yesterday as news of the accusation broke in the US.</p>
      <p>Now a psychotherapist living in London, he became the first Catholic priest in the world to have a civil partnership in 2006 - marrying in 2017 - and has been celebrated for his work supporting LGBT and Aids causes.</p>
      <p>He is still a priest but it is understood he lost membership of the Society of African Missions in 2011.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit was filed anonymously by a 57-year-old in Manhattan Supreme Court on Wednesday and alleges, as a 16-year-old, the campus chaplain Bernard J. Lynch sexually abused him after Christian Club meetings at Mount St. Michael Academy in the Bronx in 1978 and 1979.</p>
      <p>The alleged victim's suit comes after the Child Victims Act became law in August, allowing people abused as children to bring claims that have exceeded the normal statute of limitations.</p>
      <p>Fr Lynch (72) was acquitted in Bronx court in 1989 of sexually abusing a different teenager at the same school.</p>
      <p>The boy recanted on the courtroom steps and revealed pressure had been put on him to come up with the allegation, leading to the case making international headlines.</p>
      <p>He spent a decade volunteering on a New York HIV/AIDS task force and was the only Catholic priest to testify to city council before the body passed LGBT civil rights legislation in 1986.</p>
