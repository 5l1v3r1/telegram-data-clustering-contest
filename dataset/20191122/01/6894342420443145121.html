      <h1>Joker 2: Todd Phillips Clarifies News About Sequel</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:58:28+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/dashran/" target="_blank">Dashran Yohan</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/199798/joker-2-sequel-is-in-the-works-with-todd-phillips-back-as-the-director/">Two days ago, we reported that a sequel to <i><b>Joker </b></i>is all but confirmed</a>. THR broke the news, stating that sources told them that Todd Phillips was currently in talks with Warner Bros to reprise his role as director for a second Joker outing and will likely reteam with Joaquin Phoenix once again. It sounded like it was only a matter of putting pen to paper, especially given the film’s phenomenal run at the box office.</p>
      <p>What was also interesting about the THR report is that apparently, Todd Phillips approached Warner Bros Pictures Group chairman Toby Emmerich on October 7 (after the film’s successful opening weekend haul) and proposed to develop a bunch of origin stories for a plethora of DC characters. Emmerich refused. Perhaps because he was still unconvinced of the film’s financial potential at the time.</p>
      <p>Now, Joker director Todd Phillips himself has come out to shed some light on the news that certainly put a smile on the faces of most DC fans. In an interview with <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/todd-phillips-disputes-joker-sequel-rumors-no-contract-1202191289/"><b>IndieWire</b></a>, Phillips said that he hasn’t even been offered a contract by Warner Bros just yet.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>Here’s the real truth about a sequel. While Joaquin and I have talked about it, and while touring the world with Warner Bros executives — going to Toronto, and Venice, and other places — of course, we’re sitting at dinner and they’re saying, ‘So, have you thought about…?’ But, talking about contracts, there’s not a contract for us to even write a sequel, we’ve never approached Joaquin to be in a sequel. Will that happen? Again, I just think the article was anticipatory at best.</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Now, this does not mean that a sequel will not happen at all, but nothing is set in stone just yet.</p>

      <p>Phillips also completely refuted THR’s report that a meeting took place on October 7 between him and Toby Emmerich.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>I can honestly say to you there was no meeting that ever happened on October 7 where I marched in. First of all, if you know me and my career, that’s not my style. I made a huge comedy at Warner Bros., ‘The Hangover,’ and I didn’t suddenly become a comedy factory producer, like, oh, let’s just churn out movies. Bradley [Cooper] and I have a production company at Warners. I’ve been at Warners for 15, 16 years. We have two things in development at all times, not 40 things like some people. I’m not the kind of guy who goes marching in saying I want these 40 titles. I just don’t have the energy.</b>
