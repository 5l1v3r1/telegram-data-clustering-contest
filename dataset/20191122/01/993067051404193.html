      <p>THE biggest surprise about writer-director Kasi Lemmons' biopic of crusading abolitionist Harriet Tubman is that it has taken Hollywood so long to immortalise the 19th century African-American trailblazer.</p>
      <p>Born into slavery in Maryland as Araminta Ross, Tubman wriggled free from the clutches of her masters and became a conductor on a secret network of safe houses known as the Underground Railroad.</p>
      <p>She personally shepherded fellow slaves across the border to safety, served as a spy for the Union Army and remains one of the only women to lead an armed expedition on American soil.</p>
      <p>Scripted by Lemmons and co-writer Gregory Allen Howard, Harriet romanticises the lead character on a pristine surface level, relying on a barnstorming lead performance from London-born Cynthia Erivo to atone for a sinful lack of character development.</p>
      <p>The film's most intriguing, psychologically complex relationship, between Harriet and her owner's son, evades deep and satisfying consideration.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, supporting players are reduced to historical footnotes, portrayed vividly by an esteemed ensemble cast including Tony Award-winning Hamilton star Leslie Odom Jr, Janelle Monae and Clarke Peters.</p>
      <p>By contrast, composer Terence Blanchard's score is bombastic overkill.</p>
      <p>In 1849 Dorchester County, Araminta Ross (Erivo) and most of her family are slaves owned by Edward Brodess (Mike Marunde), who coldly refuses to acknowledge the clan's claim to freedom.</p>
      <p>Minty's husband John Tubman (Zackary Momoh) and father Ben (Peters), both free men, are powerless to intervene.</p>
      <p>"You, your momma, your brothers and your sisters belong to me for life," Brodess snarls at a distraught Araminta, who suffers regular fainting fits, which she contends are prescient visions from God.</p>
      <p>Minty prays aloud for Brodess to pay dearly for his heartless transgression and, on cue, he dies.</p>
      <p>Widow Eliza Brodess (Jennifer Nettles) and venomous son Gideon (Joe Alwyn) assume control of the plantation.</p>
      <p>They advertise troublemaker Minty for sale.</p>
      <p>In response, she escapes with the help of Reverend Green (Vondie Curtis-Hall) and finds her way to fervent abolitionist William Still (Odom Jr) in Philadelphia, where she assumes the name Harriet Tubman.</p>
      <p>"By some miraculous means, you have made it 100 miles to freedom!" he gushes in awe.</p>
      <p>Landlady Marie Buchanon (Monae) offers Harriet safe sanctuary but a life of freedom without loved ones weighs heavily on the escapee.</p>
      <p>She defies William's stern advice and returns to Maryland to liberate family and neighbours until the "monster called slavery is dead".</p>
      <p>Harriet is a worthy but formulaic history lesson energised by an emotionally raw performance from Erivo.</p>
      <p>She delivers the script's sermons - "God don't mean people to own people!" - with the sincerity and fury they deserve.</p>
      <p>Tears course down her cheeks more readily than ours.</p>
