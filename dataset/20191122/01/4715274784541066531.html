      <p>The contingents and resources were presented Thursday during the Send-Off Ceremony here in Calamba City graced by the Functional Area Director for Games Security and Safety-PHISGOC retired AFP General Gregorio Pio Catapang.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano on Thursday slammed former president Benigno Aquino III for the latter’s criticism against the P55-million worth of cauldron that will be used for the 2019 Southeast Asian Games.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Cayetano accused the opposition of politicizing the SEAGAMES issue as it is preparing for the 2022 national elections. </p>
      <p>Cayetano said Aquino also used to beg the Senate not to criticize the P10-billion budget for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Leaders’ Meeting in 2015.</p>
      <p>Brig. Gen. Vicente D Danao Jr., as the Commander of Task Group Southern Luzon, presented the forces and resources and was acknowledged by the Special Task Force 30th SEA Games Commander Police Brigadier General Rey Lyndon Lawas.</p>
      <p>The Southeast Asian Games is a biennial regional multi-sport event that the country will be hosting starting on Nov. 30 to Dec. 11, 2019. A total of 9,840 athletes who will compete in 529 events in 56 sports make this edition the largest Southeast Asian Games in terms of sports and events contested.</p>
      <p>The event will have competition venues spread across 23 cities across the country, divided into four clusters. </p>
      <p>Catapang commended Danao for the excellent security preparations. He encouraged the contingents to play their important roles in securing not only the athletes and the delegates from the eleven participating countries but also the spectators who will flock at the sports venues to witness the events.</p>
      <p>Danao said the contingents from PNP CALABARZON already knew their primary functions while on the field. </p>
      <p>Permit to Carry Firearms Outside of Residence in Region 3, 4A, NCR and the entire province of La Union were suspended until Dec. 14 to ensure the safety and security of all participants and the populace. <b>With Maricel V. Cruz</b></p>
