        <b>Portimão City Council has approved a €1.5 million grant to support the return of the MotoGP World Championship at the Algarve International Autodrome (AIA).</b>
      </p>
      <p>“The House unanimously approved a proposal for financial support for international MotoGP events, totalling €1.5 million for three years, or €500,000 per year for each Grand Prix,” said the Mayor Isilda Gomes.</p>
      <p>According to the mayor, the document acknowledges the high interest of the championship, “for the economic impact and the image projection capacity of the Algarve and Portugal around the world”.</p>
      <p>“We consider that a race of this category will bring a huge projection for the region and of Portugal, in terms of tourism, in view of its global dimension,” she said.</p>
      <p>The document guarantees payment of €1.5 million over a period of three years to Dorna, the holder of the rights to hold the MotoGP World Championship, if the event is held at the Algarve International Race Track.</p>
      <p>The president of the International Motorcycling Federation (FIM) said that the MotoGP World Championship could return to Portugal in 2022, and the Portuguese Government has already expressed its willingness to find a solution for the race.</p>
      <p>Portugal has been removed from the elite of motorcycling since 2012, when the Estoril racetrack received the last Grand Prix of Portugal, after 13 consecutive years on the calendar.</p>
