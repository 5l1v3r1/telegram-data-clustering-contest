      <p>A yacht confiscated by police after it was allegedly used in an attempt to import almost one tonne of illegal drugs into Australia is up for sale.</p>
      <p>While the 17-metre vessel costs about $560,000 new, this one struck a reef on approach to Western Australia earlier this year, sparking a sea search that ended with authorities uncovering about 40 bags of illicit drugs.</p>
      <p>It now has a minimum price tag of $95,000 and will be sold by online auction, with bidding closing on December 10.</p>

      <p>WA Police seized the vessel in September after an investigation found it was involved in the transportation of around 900 kilograms of cocaine, MDMA and methamphetamine.</p>

      <p>At the time, police praised the help of the local fishing community in tracking down the men allegedly involved after a tip-off from the public about the stricken yacht near Stick Island, part of the Abrolhos Islands group.</p>
      <p>Fishers reported the "unusual" movements of its crew.</p>
      <p>"The fishing community of Geraldton played a significant role in this detection and seizure and maintained regular contact with police as this matter unfolded," WA Police Commissioner Chris Dawson said at the time.</p>
      <p>It was estimated the drugs found would be worth "in the order of one billion [dollars]", he said at a later press conference.</p>
      <p>AFP criminal assets confiscation taskforce national co-ordinator Detective Superintendent Kate Ferry said while the yacht may not be in "pristine condition" it would give the new owner an interesting tale to tell.</p>
      <p>WA Police State Crime Commander Allan Adams said seizing assets linked to the distribution of illegal drugs was as important as seizing the drugs themselves.</p>
      <p>“Targeting assets held and used by established criminal networks, in particular those that could be used in future illicit drug trafficking activities, assists with the continual detection and disruption activities being undertaken by state and Commonwealth law enforcement agencies," he said.</p>

      <p>Five men were arrested as part of the investigation and will appear in Perth Magistrates Court in January. They are facing a variety of charges, with penalties ranging from 20 years in prison to life.</p>
