        <b>Portugal’s Troia Resort has been voted the country’s best course by National Club Golfer (NCG) in its ‘Top 100 Golf Courses in Continental Europe 2019’ rankings.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The resort has further established itself among Europe’s elite venues by appearing in yet another top 10 ranking – this time rated number seven by NCG.</p>
      <p>The news caps off an impressive year for the stunning Trent Jones Senior links – which also made a sensational nine-place climb up to number eight in Golf World’s prestigious top 100 rankings.</p>
      <p>Rated five places above its nearest Portuguese rival, the ranking reaffirms that golfers and industry experts are finally taking notice of the resort after, perhaps, being underappreciated due to the exceptional standard of golf courses across the country.</p>
      <p>Assessed over nine different categories – design, condition, consistency, setting, playability, challenge, variety, routing and charm – Troia scored an impressive 79 points out of a possible 100, with the magazine’s judging panel scoring the course highly in all criteria.</p>
      <p>The par-72 layout stretches 6,317m along the beach, offering panoramic views of the Atlantic Ocean and Arrábida mountain range throughout the 18 holes.</p>
      <p>When announcing its top 100 rankings, the National Club Golfer judging panel remarked: “Troia offers the feel and look of a classic links and the routing is superb – never losing sight of the sea. And, while it is very difficult, our panel loved the Trent Jones classic. Portugal’s number one.”</p>
      <p>Alexandre Barroso, Troia’s golf director, said: “Troia really is a golfing experience like no other and we’re delighted that it’s finally being recognised and rewarded for its special and unique characteristics.</p>
      <p>“To appear in our second European top 10 and, of course, be voted the best course in Portugal is a dream come true for everyone involved with the resort, as we all know this is where it deserves to be.</p>
      <p>“We invite any golfer from across the world to come and experience it for themselves and discover everything the course and resort has to offer – you won’t be disappointed!”</p>
