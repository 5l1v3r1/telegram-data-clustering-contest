      <p>Faced with a 3rd-down, the Houston Texans were looking to be on their way to punt the ball away to the Indianapolis Colts until DeAndre Hopkins had his number called.</p>
      <p>While scrambling in the pocket, the shifty WR caught a pass near the sidelines that was ruled out, but a ref came in to change his mind, because Hopkins pulled off an unreal toe-drag to complete that catch.</p>
