      <p>All the Euro 2020 group games have been completed and we have some familiar Countries that have confirmed their participation in this tournament. We are expecting to see some great games in 2020. To top it off, this is also the 60th anniversary of the <b><a href="https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro-2020/">UEFA Euro Cup</a> </b>and add to the excitement the games will be hosted in several Countries across Europe. Football is still one of the most popular sports in Europe, and we expect many to follow the matches next year. It comes as no surprise to see Spain, Belgium, Germany, England, France and Portugal which has some outstanding players that will hopefully take  their Country to the lead. </p>
