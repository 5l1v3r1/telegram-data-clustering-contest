      <p>OPERATING theatres at three out of Northern Ireland's five health trusts are lying unused or at under-capacity due to a shortage of skilled staff.</p>
      <p>Belfast, Southern and Western trusts have all had to reduce the number of non-emergency operations, the BBC reported.</p>
      <p>In Belfast, the issue is a lack of perioperative nurses - those caring for patients before and after surgery - rather than theatre staff, leading to "2.5 operating theatres per week not providing their routine service... across all surgical specialities".</p>
      <p>In Craigavon, one theatre is not in use and another in Daisy Hill is at reduced capacity due to a "shortage of theatre nurses", although "emergency, red flag and urgent surgery is continuing as normal".</p>
      <p>It is understood that the number of operations at both hospitals are also at lower `winter levels' in anticipation of the annual pressures associated with the season.</p>
      <p>"Theatre staffing shortages" in Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry have left "an average of ten theatres sessions per week... currently not providing their routine service".</p>
      <p>Emergency theatres, trauma theatre and labour ward are not affected and both South West Acute Hospital and Omagh Hospital and Primary Care Complex are unaffected.</p>
      <p>All three trusts refused to say how long the staff shortages have been forcing a drop in the number of operations, so it is unclear whether the effects are already being seen in the north's "unacceptable" hospital waiting lists, or if they will cause a further spike.</p>
      <p>The trusts said they are continuing to try to recruit staff to fill the vacancies and are unable to say when they expect theatres to be back at capacity.</p>
