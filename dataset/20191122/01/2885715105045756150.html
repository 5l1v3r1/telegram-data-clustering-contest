      <p>TWO DAYS after a 10-year-old girl died after a cement block fell on her while she was entering a Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) building in Chembur, the police are looking into two aspects of the incident — safety and security norms that the builder should have followed during construction and the spot from where the cement block fell on the girl.</p>
      <p>Pratibha Shingare had gone to buy milk at 10.30 am Monday. While returning to her house in the SRA building in Panchsheel Nagar, a cement block fell on her. She sustained serious injuries and was rushed to Rajawadi hospital in Ghatkopar. When her condition did not improve, she was shifted to KEM hospital, where she passed away Tuesday.</p>
      <p>After protests by the residents of the 15-storey SRA building, the police registered a case under Section 304 (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code against the builder.</p>
      <p>Senior Inspector of Tilak Nagar police, S Kamble, said some parts of the building were still under construction. “Work was taking place slowly. We are checking with SRA if residents are allowed to stay in an underconstruction building and the measures that the builder should have taken. Certain provisions, like a safety net, were missing, so an FIR was registered,” Kamble said.</p>
      <p>He said another police team is investigating from where the cement block had fallen on the girl. “The building’s first two and last two floors are unoccupied. We are checking with residents of other floors that had windows on the side the girl was passing from.”</p>
      <p>“We have found that people keep stones over clothes to dry them so that they did not fly away. Most of the floors have a common gallery where clothes are dried. We are talking to residents to find out from where the slab fell,” the officer said.</p>
