      <h1>Key! Hazily Raps Over Acoustic Melodies on Working On Dying-Produced "Kirkwood Freestyle"</h1>
      <h2>“I’m Beyoncé and I’m Hova / This a Demon, not a Cobra.”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:03:51+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:03</time> by <a rel="author">Patrick Montes</a></address>
      <p>Towards the end of June, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/key">Key!</a> served up his latest full-length project, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/6/key-so-emotional-mixtape-stream"><i>So Emotional</i></a>. The follow-up to last year’s collaborative tape with Kenny Beats, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2018/5/key-kenny-beats-777-album-stream"><i>777</i></a>, <i>So Emotional</i> provided us with eight new songs. With 2019 coming to a close, the influential Atlanta rapper introduces “Kirkwood Freestyle,” a new single produced by Dro Fe, Purple K and the Working On Dying crew.</p>
      <p>“My bitch don’t wear Fashion Nova / I’m a dog, can’t roll me over / Remember that shit like I was sober / When I was down, she still bent over,” Key! hazily croons during the chorus of “Kirkwood Freestyle.” “I’m Beyoncé and I’m Hova / This a Demon, not a Cobra / This a Glock and it don’t jam / You more thirsty than your girlfriend / Money coming in a whirlwind / And we gon’ pour this like the world’s ending.”</p>
      <p>“The whole point for me is to conquer everything I hear or comes to my mind, so I never tried to limit myself on it,” Key! shared with during an exchange for a July 2018 edition of our <i>MIC/LINE</i> podcast. “I like discovering new things and try to attack it. I don’t feel anybody who makes music will have the same experience, so this should be an instrument. I’m the saxophone and this saxophone needs to go everywhere… I don’t think about it as staying new or nothing, I just don’t want to make the same song twice.”</p>
