      <p>Myles Garrett has been taking a bunch of heat for his actions on Thursday Night Football that had him ripping off Mason Rudolph’s helmet and beating him over the head with it. Those actions got him suspended for the remainder of the season.</p>
      <p>Browns fans are standing by their guy no matter what, so much so, that many of them decided to fight back against Mason Rudolph, who many believe escalated the fight to begin with.</p>
      <p>Browns fans have <a href="https://bustedcoverage.com/2019/11/20/browns-fans-bags-of-dicks-mason-rudolph/">reportedly</a> been sending Rudolph sending <a href="https://dicksbymail.com/">Bags of Dicks</a> and gummy penises straight to the Steeelrs facility for him to chew on.</p>
