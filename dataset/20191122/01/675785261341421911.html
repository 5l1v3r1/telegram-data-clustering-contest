      <h1>General election: Tories to target foreign residents who buy homes in UK</h1>
      <h2>The Conservatives say they would use the money raised to help more Britons get on the housing ladder and to tackle the scandal of rough sleeping. But critics say they are just rehashing an old policy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:34:27+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:34</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Bartlett, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nicola-bartlett/</a></address>
      <p>The Tories would force foreign nationals buying property in the UK to pay more stamp duty under Conservative proposals to help more Britons get on the housing ladder.</p>
      <p>Buyers who are not tax resident in the UK will be made to pay a higher rate of stamp duty land tax if the Tories win a majority at the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election</a> .</p>
      <p>The surcharge will be levied on top of all other stamp duty payable and charged at 3%.</p>
      <p>This means foreign-based buyers would have to pay up to 18% in stamp duty. </p>
      <p>The party estimates the measure will raise up to £120 million a year, which would be directed at programmes to tackle rough sleeping.</p>
      <p>Currently, foreign individuals and companies can buy homes as easily as UK residents.</p>
      <p>But critics say the policy is not new and merely builds on plans announced by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/theresa-may">Theresa May</a> at the Conservative Party conference in 2018.</p>
      <p>The Tories say the plan will help more Britons get on the housing ladder, as well as fund efforts to tackle rough sleeping.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak said: "The Conservative Party is levelling up opportunities across the country, helping millions of people into home ownership.</p>
      <p>"Evidence shows that by adding significant amounts of demand to limited housing supply, purchases by non-residents inflate house prices.</p>
      <p>"That is why we are introducing a higher rate of stamp duty for non-UK residents that will help to address this issue and could raise up to £120 million."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said Britain would "always be open to people coming to live, work, and build a life in this great country," adding: "The steps we are taking will ensure that more people have the opportunity of a great place to live and build a family.</p>

      <p>"House-building is already at its highest level for 30 years, with over 240,000 homes delivered last year.</p>
      <p>"A vote for the Conservatives will allow us to get on with implementing our ambitious domestic agenda, instead of a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> government spending 2020 distracted by another two chaotic referendums rather than focusing on people's priorities."</p>
