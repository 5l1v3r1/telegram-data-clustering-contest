      <p>Sir, – I completely agree with Brian Falter (<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/football-s-carbon-footprint-1.4089858">Letters, November 21st</a>) about the environmental impact of international football.</p>
      <p>Sadly, judging by the Irish Times article, “<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/international/slovakia-v-ireland-cheap-routes-ticket-info-and-the-price-of-a-pint-1.4089802">Slovakia v Ireland: Cheap routes, ticket info and the price of a pint</a>”, our breath is being wasted. Nowhere in this article does it mention the serious carbon footprint from flying.</p>
      <p>Can I suggest The Irish Times might in future call attention to the environmental impact of options when recommending ways of getting to international sporting events?</p>
      <p>I am sure the best fans in the world will be only too delighted to see the climate crisis not having to be decided on penalties for once. – Yours, etc,</p>
