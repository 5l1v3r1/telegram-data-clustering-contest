      <p>NEW DELHI: State-run entities will stay off when the government puts India’s second-largest public sector oil refiner and fuel retailer Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) on the block, a move that is expected to make the offering attractive for foreign majors.</p>
      <p>“Since 2014, we have a clear vision that the government has no business to be in business ... Nitty gritty and details of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/disinvestment">disinvestment</a> process will have to be worked out but when I say the government has no business to be in business, it is indicative of possible future course of action,” oil and steel minister <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Dharmendra-Pradhan">Dharmendra Pradhan</a> said on the sidelines of an industry function on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The cabinet on Wednesday cleared the proposal to privatise BPCL by selling the government’s 53.3% stake with management control to a strategic investor. This will be the first privatisation of an oil company by the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Narendra-Modi">Narendra Modi</a> government. BPCL will give the buyer access to 14% of India’s oil refining capacity and about a fourth of the fuel marketing infrastructure in the world’s fastest-growing energy market.</p>

      <p>On Thursday, the decision to sell BPCL drew flak from Congress member and former oil minister <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Veerappa-Moily">Veerappa Moily</a> who described it as “an attempt to sell away an important soul of the public sector”. There is no reason to sell a profitable company managed by excellent professionals, he said in a statement demanding a rollback. Pradhan pointed out that private competition in telecom and aviation sectors led to customers benefiting from price cuts, efficiency and better service.</p>
