      <p>“Editors, journalists and Nigerian media practitioners generally deserve strong commendation for their service to our nation despite the challenging environment they operate in.</p>
      <p>“However, beyond the accolades, this historic project of commemorating 160 years of Nigerian journalism is to further inspire the media as the fourth estate of the realm, to do a better job of advocating good governance for the betterment of all citizens while also consistently holding public officials to account for their stewardship,” Kolawole said.</p>
      <p>He added that all featured editors will receive the Special Posterity Media Gatekeepers Award for their patriotic contributions to Journalism and Development in Nigeria.</p>
