      <p>Shares of marijuana companies rose on Thursday after a U.S. congressional committee passed a legislation to decriminalize cannabis, taking it a step closer to being approved by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Shares of marijuana companies rose on Thursday after a U.S. congressional committee passed a legislation to decriminalize cannabis, taking it a step closer to being approved by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.</p>
      <p>The bill, which was passed 24 to 10 in the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, sent shares of Canopy Growth , Aurora Cannabis , Aphria Inc and Tilray Inc up between 8per cent and 15per cent.</p>

      <p>"We think federal legalization would be a big positive for investor sentiment surrounding cannabis equities, which have been battered by oversupply and a steep price decline for the underlying commodity since becoming legal in Canada," said Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research.</p>
      <p>The approval comes two months after the House passed a bill to advance legislation that would allow banks to provide services to cannabis companies in states where it is legal.</p>
      <p>The latest bill, which has more than 50 co-sponsors, enables states to set their own policies while allowing to expunge federal marijuana convictions and arrests.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the bill will authorize a 5per cent federal sales tax on marijuana products that are manufactured in or imported into the United States.</p>
      <p>However, analysts were skeptical about the future of the bill.</p>
      <p>"It's such an early step in a long process that there are no near-term implications for cannabis stocks. The Senate isn't likely to approve it, even if the House were to do so," said Alan Brochstein, managing partner at New Cannabis Ventures.</p>
      <p>Shares in the sector are down more than 25per cent this year, according to the alternative harvest ETF , which tracks cannabis-related stocks, taking a blow from a slow roll out of retail stores and oversupply in Canada, as well as uncertainties related to U.S. regulations.</p>
      <p>Weed companies have been spending heavily to expand and strike partnerships in the United States, banking on more states legalizing cannabis for both recreational and medical use.</p>
      <p>Currently, 11 U.S. states have legalized marijuana for recreational use, while 33 states have approved it for medical purposes.</p>
