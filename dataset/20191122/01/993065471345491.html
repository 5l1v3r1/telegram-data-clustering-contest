      <p>News that a number of hospitals are cutting back on operations due to staff shortages is a further sign of the deepening crisis in our health service.</p>
      <p>The Belfast, southern and western trusts have all confirmed they are experiencing difficulties in providing a full surgical service with recruitment of skilled theatre nurses a particular problem.</p>
      <p>This is the last thing that patients who are already on unacceptably long waiting lists in Northern Ireland want to hear.</p>
      <p>Altnagelvin is losing an average of ten theatre sessions a week although emergencies, trauma and labour theatres are not affected.</p>
      <p>The southern trust has reduced sessions in Craigavon Area Hospital and Daisy Hill Hospital while stressing that `emergency, red flag and urgent surgery is continuing as normal.'</p>
      <p>The Belfast trust says approximately 2.5 operating theatres per week are not providing their routine service and this is across all medical specialties.</p>
      <p>It is not clear how many patients will have their procedures delayed as a result of this nurse shortage but obviously this is a worrying situation as we head into the crucial winter period when demand increases.</p>
      <p>From the limited information provided, it is also not apparent how long this reduced service will be in place or when we can expect staffing levels to return to the appropriate level.</p>
      <p>This development comes at a time when the Department of Health is under pressure to resolve a dispute with nursing unions over pay and conditions.</p>
      <p>For the first time in its 103-year history, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has voted for strike action, with a walkout due to take place on December 18.</p>
      <p>Potentially, this could coincide with industrial action by healthcare staff belonging to Unison, which is planning a work to rule from next week.</p>
      <p>The implications for patient care and wider services as a result of protracted industrial action could be enormous, and many patients will be concerned about how it will directly impact on them.</p>
      <p>Even without the threat of disruption to services, patients are already being affected as the announcement of surgical reductions and the already long waiting times demonstrate.</p>
      <p>We know the health budget is under pressure and the lack of a minister is a major issue.</p>
      <p>But it also has to be recognised that staffing gaps and increased workloads are a problem that needs to be addressed.</p>
