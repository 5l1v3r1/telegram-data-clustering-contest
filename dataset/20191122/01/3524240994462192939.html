      <p>The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, Adebunmi Adekanye, has urged intending pilgrims to the holy land of Israel to be good ambassadors of the state.</p>
      <p>Adekanye stated this at the service of dedication for the November/December batch at the Chapel of Christ The Light, Alausa, with the theme, ‘In His Presence.’</p>
      <p>The senior government official, who also represented the Commissioner for Home Affairs, Uzamat Akinbile-Yusuf, urged the pilgrims to see the journey as a spiritual retreat.</p>
      <p>She said, “We have been in preparation for this for some time now; we have done medical and administrative screening and we are ready to go.</p>
      <p>“This service of dedication is themed ‘In His Presence’ because we believe we are going to the Lord’s presence to intercede for our country, families and we believe that we shall come back full of testimonies.</p>
      <p>“We advise you to comport yourself as good ambassadors of the Christendom and Lagos State. I advise everybody to shun any intention to abscond; we should all go for the purpose for which we are sent and come back to continue our life in a better way.”</p>
      <p>The Board Secretary, Christian Pilgrims Welfare Board, Yetunde Gbafe, while educating the intending pilgrims on some expectations of the government of Israel, added that the state government had put machineries in place to apprehend those who might want to use the opportunity to abscond to other countries.</p>
      <p>Gbafe, however, assured the intending pilgrims of the state government’s welfare packages that would sustain them on their journey.</p>
      <p>According to her, over 900 intending pilgrims are ready to be airlifted to Israel.</p>
