      <h1>Mighty Celt Tyrone McKenna determined to show no quarter in Golden Contract opener</h1>

      <p>TYRONE McKenna intends to make a definitive statement in front of his light-welterweight rivals tonight in the quarter-finals of the lucrative Golden Contract tournament, live on Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>The brash Belfast fighter who ‘can talk the talk and walk the walk' takes on England's Mikey Sakyi at London's York Hall in the third of the quarter-finals with the eventual winner of the competition landing a two-year, five-fight deal with six-figure purses for each fight guaranteed.</p>
      <p>Luckless former McKenna opponent Lewis Benson withdrew from the competition this week after the BBBofC raised concerns over an eye test meaning that England's Jeff Ofori has been drafted in as a late replacement.</p>
      <p>Rangy southpaw McKenna won the WBO International title with a unanimous decision win over Darragh Foley in June. The ‘Mighty Celt' has all the attributes required to be a hit-and-move boxer but he is also happy to plant his feet and trade punches.</p>
      <p>“I've seen a bit of Mikey Sakyi fight on YouTube,” said McKenna ahead of the 10-rounder.</p>
      <p>“I saw him beat Siar Ozgul and it seems he has a bit of power but there's nothing too concerning.</p>
      <p>“He's good on the back foot too but I believe I'm better in most if not every department.</p>
      <p>“The fact he can hit doesn't concern me. Most fighters I've fought have power and I spar Sam Maxwell, who is one of the hardest hitters in the division around here.</p>
      <p>“He said he picks me because he wants his first TV fight to be exciting and everyone knows that I always bring entertainment. If he's coming for a war, so am I so it should be a beautiful night.</p>
      <p>“On Friday, I'm putting on a performance that will show I'm going to win this competition. I have no doubt in my mind and after Friday, I don't think anyone else will.”</p>
      <p>First up tonight at 7.30pm is Kieran Gething v Jeff Ofori then Mohamed Mimoune v Darren Surtees, McKenna v Sakyi and Logan Yoon versus Ohara Davies.</p>
