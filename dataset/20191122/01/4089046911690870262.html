      <p><b>KNOX COUNTY, Tenn. (WVLT) --</b> Knox County prosecutors said a man was sentenced to 12 years in prison after multiple DUI convictions.</p>
      <p>Dennis William Bunch, 52, pleaded guilty to driving under the influence sixth or subsequent offense, the District Attorney's office said.</p>
      <p>Officials said on June 22, 2017 Bunch tried to flee the scene of a single-vehicle wreck with the help of a walker on East Beaver Creek. Passengers in the car said Bunch was the driver, and he was taken into custody shortly after.</p>
      <p>Investigators said Bunch admitted to drinking six beers but wouldn't perform field sobriety tests.</p>
      <p>The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said a crime lab analysis of Bunch's blood showed the BAC to be twice the legal limit.</p>
      <p>Bunch had multiple DUI convictions in Knox, Loudon and Grainger Counties, officials said, as well as prior felony convictions that included Voluntary Manslaughter.</p>
