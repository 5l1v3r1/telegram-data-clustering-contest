      <h1>Remains in Nevada identified as Pennsylvania woman allegedly lured to desert by boyfriend</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:10:28+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:10</time> by <a rel="author">Morgan Phillips</a></address>
      <p>Officials said Thursday they'd found the body of Jaime Feden, who was allegedly lured into the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/nevada">Nevada</a> desert by her married boyfriend and killed.</p>
      <p>A detective contacted the Clark County, Nevada, Coroners Office to tell officials there he'd found a dead, unidentified woman on Oct. 5. The coroner confirmed the identity of the body as Feden through dental records.</p>
      <p>Feden, 33, was last seen in Pittsburgh on Sept. 15. John Matthew Chapman, referred to as Feden’s boyfriend, reportedly confessed to killing her when he was arrested last Friday.</p>
      <p>Chapman convinced Feden to<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/pennsylvania-man-arrested-confessing-murder-girlfriend-las-vegas-police"> take a cross-country trip</a> with him from Pennsylvania to Las Vegas to look at homes in late September, according to reports. He then lured Feden into the desert for a “photoshoot.”</p>

      <p>He allegedly told police he used zip ties to bind Feden’s hands and feet and tied her to a pole before covering her mouth and nose with duct tape and suffocating her.</p>

      <p>He then removed the ties and tape along with Feden’s clothing before leaving her body on the ground near the signpost and driving back to Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>Feden was just over 4 feet tall and weighed 75 pounds, police said. She reportedly suffered from VATER syndrome, a rare congenital condition. The letters stand for vertebrae, anus, trachea, esophagus and renal (or kidneys), which are the areas of the body that are affected.</p>
      <p>After Chapman was taken into custody he called his wife, Maureen, and said, “I killed her because I had to,” Maureen told WPXI. She said her husband was living a “double life” and had told his family he was going to Las Vegas on a work trip.</p>

      <p>Chapman will be extradited to Nevada if he is charged with homicide.</p>
