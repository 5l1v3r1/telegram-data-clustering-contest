      <h1>AUD/JPY: Flashing marginal gains, 100-day MA is key support</h1>

      <p>AUD/JPY is reporting marginal gains at press time, having defended key support for a third straight day on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The currency pair is currently trading at 73.83, representing a 0.15% gain on the day.</p>
      <p>The bid tone around the anti-risk Japanese Yen has likely weakened, possibly due to the uptick in the US index futures. Currently, the S&amp;P 500 futures are adding 0.15% on the day.</p>
      <p>China's commerce ministry on Thursday dismissed reports stating that the trade talks between the US and China are in trouble and reiterated that the world's second-largest economy will work with the US side on the basis of equality and mutual respect in addressing the core concerns.</p>
      <p>Even so, the US equity markets dipped Thursday. For instance, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.20%. The risk <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a>, however, is looking to stabilize in Asia. The AUD/JPY pair may extend gains if the risk reset gathers pace.  </p>
      <p>That said, investors may be wary of initiating bullish bets on stocks, courtesy of optimism and pessimism seesaw. Both sides have a history of mentioning the change of interim deal only to backtrack in the same sentence.</p>
      <p>Therefore, big gains in AUD/JPY look unlikely - more so, due to the downbeat <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/audusd">Aussie</a> PMI released earlier today. The headline <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">Manufacturing PMI</a> came in above 49.8 forecasts to 49.9 but slipped beneath 50.1 prior while Services PMI declined to 49.5 versus 53.5 expected and 50.1 earlier.</p>
      <h3>Technical levels</h3>
      <p>The 100-day MA, currently at 73.59, has been restricting downside since Nov. 19. Therefore, a break below that level, if confirmed, could embolden sellers, leading to a quick drop to 73.00.</p>
