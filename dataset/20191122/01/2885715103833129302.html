      <p>A MALE tiger in captivity at the Gorewada Wildlife Rescue Centre here will soon be shifted to the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sanjay-gandhi">Sanjay Gandhi</a> National Park (SGNP) in Mumbai to solve the problem of tiger breeding there, officials said.</p>
      <p>Called Sultan, the tiger, now four years old, was captured from Brahmapuri forest in Chandrapur district last year after it killed two persons.</p>
      <p>“SGNP authorities had asked us for a male tiger since they are facing a breeding problem. So, with permission from Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife) Nitin Kakodkar and the Central Zoo Authority (CZA), we will hand over the tiger to SGNP authorities at the earliest,” said Rambabu, Managing Director of Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM), which runs the Gorewada centre. “But Sultan will be in SGNP only for breeding purpose, not for exhibition,” he added.</p>
      <p>“SGNP currently has four female and a male tiger. One male tiger called Yash died of cancer in May this year. The other, called Anand, aged about 10 years, is an offspring of the oldest female tiger, Basanti, about 17 years of age, and sibling of Laxmi. So breeding is not possible among them. Anand has been found incapable of copulating with the other two female tigers, Bijli and Mastani, who were procured from Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR) two years ago. Even Yash was unable to copulate with the two tigresses. So we needed a male for breeding,” said SGNP veterinarian Shailesh Pethe.</p>
      <p>Bijli and Mastani, aged eight years, were brought to SGNP from PTR two years ago after the forest department’s attempt to release them in the wild failed. They were rescued as orphan cubs from Chandrapur district.</p>
      <p>SGNP Chief Conservator of Forest Anwar Ahmed said, “We will bring Sultan to SGNP in the first week of December.”</p>
