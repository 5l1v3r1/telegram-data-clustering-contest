      <p>A fundraiser to help support Jessie Simpson will take place at a Kamloops nightclub tomorrow.</p>
      <p>The fundraiser is being organized by the Hi, Society for Simpson who was left with <a href="https://infotel.ca/newsitem/breaking-teichrieb-facing-seven-years-in-jail-for-bat-assault-on-kamloops-teen/it56723">catastrophic injuries after a violent bat assault in 2016.</a></p>
      <p>Simpson was left bedridden and is dependent on caregivers.</p>
      <p>His mother, Susanna, says tomorrow night’s fundraiser at Cactus Jacks nightclub was organized by Jessie’s friends at Hi, Society where Jessie used to volunteer.</p>
      <p>Proceeds from the event will go towards various needs for Jessie. Susana says her son is currently waiting for a call to head to a rehab centre in Ponoka, Alberta. He is currently living at a care facility.</p>
      <p>“Jessie has a lot of needs so we are just going to keep fundraising,” Susanna says, adding she hasn’t been able to work while she supports her son.</p>
      <p>Donations will be used for food, gas and insurance as well as providing an overall better quality of life for Jessie, she says.</p>
      <p>“I want to make this Christmas his best one. A boy passed away in the home where he is and it really makes you think that… if there is something we can do for him to make his life better, then that’s wonderful,” she says.</p>
      <p>The event will take place tomorrow, Nov. 22, at Cactus Jacks from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. There will be a silent auction and raffle, local and international DJs.</p>
      <p>Participants must be 19 years or older to attend. Tickets will be available at the door for a minimum donation of $10.</p>
