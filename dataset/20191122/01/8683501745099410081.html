      <p>It’s been a little over a week since the new streaming service Disney+ launched. Just checking in, are we all okay? The ability to stream all this content can be overwhelming – especially between <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2485314/lets-talk-about-baby-yodas-age-in-the-mandalorian"><i>The Mandalorian</i>’s Baby Yoda</a> filling our hearts or the beauty of throwback hits like <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2484472/disney-has-boy-meets-world-and-darkwing-duck-trending-on-twitter-right-now"><i>Darkwing Duck</i> and <i>Boy Meets World</i> binge watches</a>. And let's not forget Marvel hits such as <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> having a new spot on the service.</p>
      <p>But sadly, it sounds like the big stars you can watch on the service don’t get a complimentary Disney+ account from the studio. You know, the one that has the top six grossing movies of 2019 – each earning over $1 billion worldwide, including <i>Endgame</i>’s $2.79 billion gross (the highest of any movie ever)! Brie Larson recently joked about it. In her words:</p>
      <blockquote>Waiting for my Disney+ comped account. I’ve got multiple pieces of art on your streaming service – including one of my first and best roles I’ve ever done, which was a film called <i>Right On Track</i>. It was a Disney Channel original movie.</blockquote>
      <p>The <i>Captain Marvel</i> actress was being congratulated during an interview on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FK1GvP8kSCE"><i>The Ellen Show</i></a> for the record-breaking success of <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>. The comedian asked Brie Larson if she received any of the loads of cash the movie earned, when she said “I don’t even have a Disney+ account!” Larson then took the “opportunity” to make her case to the studio, even giving a shout out to a role from her early career, Disney Channel’s <i>Right on Track</i>. Take a look:</p>

      <p>See her? That's Larson on the right! It was one of her first roles ever. The actress recalls being around 11 on the set of the Disney Channel movie about a pair of sisters who become involved in a car race drag competition. The movie is one of the many Disney Channel <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485191/12-big-movies-youll-still-have-to-wait-for-on-disney-and-when-theyll-arrive">gems available</a> on the streaming service, along with <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485079/yes-some-upcoming-marvel-movies-should-be-exclusive-to-disney"><i>Captain Marvel</i> and <i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a> also being present on Disney+, the latter including <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485206/the-russo-brothers-explain-why-they-cut-the-tony-stark-endgame-scene-thats-on-disney">an exclusive deleted scene with Tony Stark and his adult daughter</a>.</p>
      <p>Now, you would think big Marvel stars such as Brie Larson would get automatic access to Disney+ as some kind of perk for working for the Mouse! But, as the <i>Captain Marvel</i> star confirms, this is not something the company offers. Or perhaps it got lost in her email somewhere? Now that she’s made her case, she must have one now! Right?</p>
      <p>The streaming service has been a massive success so far, earning 10 million subscribers in its first day of launch. That’s a lot of cash for the first 24 hours, and more are undoubtedly coming down the line. Although <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2485165/how-disneys-launch-affected-netflix-usage">Netflix is apparently not so far impacted by the existence of Disney+</a>.</p>
