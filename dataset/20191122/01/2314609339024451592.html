      <p>Police have seized 700 kilograms of crystalline MDMA with the potential to make 7 million ecstasy pills that was believed to be bound for Queensland ahead of the summer music festival season.</p>
      <p>The first batch of drugs was uncovered in August, as part of an international investigation into a Dutch-based organised-crime syndicate.</p>

      <p>Following the first raid at Rotterdam, a further 15 search warrants were conducted in the Netherlands and Belgium this month that saw 11 people charged.</p>
      <p>"These search warrants uncovered concealed laboratories and 50 tonnes of precursor chemicals for the production of MDMA," an Australian Border Force statment read.</p>
      <p>Queensland Police Deputy Commissioner Tracy Linford said the drugs destined for Australian communities would "be diluted with other contaminants and then falsely pedalled as a safe drug".</p>

      <p>"They are anything but this; in fact, they are made by unsophisticated and unqualified people in clandestine conditions whose priority is not the authenticity of their product but profit," she said.</p>
      <p>The raids uncovered enough MDMA crystals and oils to produce 15 million pills.</p>
      <p>Two alleged ringleaders were arrested in the Netherlands and Belgium, a 58-year-old and a 37-year-old man. The arrested Dutch nationals have been charged by Dutch authorities and are awaiting trial in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>A 48-year-old woman from Bass Hill in NSW was arrested in Sydney on November 11 and has been extradited to Brisbane.</p>
      <p>She was charged with an attempt to possess a commercial quantity of border controlled drugs, an offence that carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.</p>
      <p>She was next due to appear in Brisbane Magistrates Court on November 29.</p>
