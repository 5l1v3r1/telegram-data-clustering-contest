      <h1>White Ribbon goes west as Perth service buys brand</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:16:18+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:16</time> by <a rel="author">Chip Le Grand</a></address>
      <p>White Ribbon, the ubiquitous symbol for ending men's violence against women, has been sold to Communicare, a Perth-based organisation which has provided domestic violence services for more than 20 years.</p>
      <p>The liquidators of White Ribbon Australia, the high-profile charity which collapsed last month after accumulating losses of about $1.3 million over the previous two financial years, today announced that Communicare had bought the failed company's intellectual property and remaining assets.</p>

      <p>The sale was welcomed by the founder of the global White Ribbon movement, White Ribbon Canada, which had previously expressed "serious reservations" about any plan to sell any intellectual property associated with the movement.</p>
      <p>“It is reassuring that Communicare, whose values and commitment align so well with the White Ribbon movement, will provide substantial experience and strong governance to the important work of White Ribbon Australia,'' White Ribbon Canada executive director Humberto Carolo said.</p>
      <p>"We look forward to collaborating with Communicare, together with local community stakeholders including womens' organisations, to challenge and support men and boys to realise their potential to be part of the solution in ending all forms of gender-based violence."</p>
      <p>The transfer of the White Ribbon brand to the West Australian organisation, which has branches across Perth and in the city of Geraldton, will also help repair the relationship between the White Ribbon movement and the broader, anti-violence sector.</p>
      <p>Prior to its collapse, White Ribbon Australia was criticised by other service providers and anti-violence campaigners for its high-cost, corporate model, tokenistic approach towards advocacy and failure to accept gender inequity as a driver of violence against women.</p>
      <p>White Ribbon Australia was also hampered in recent years by a churn of chief executives and board chairs.</p>
      <p>Communicare chief executive Melissa Perry said her organisation would provide White Ribbon, a movement which operates in 60 countries, a secure future in Australia.</p>
      <p>"We couldn’t imagine Australia without a White Ribbon campaign,'' she said. "White Ribbon Australia aligns with our values and reflects our long-standing commitment to eliminating violence against women and children.</p>
      <p>“As a White Ribbon-accredited organisation and school, we’ve seen first-hand how accreditation provides tools to strengthen a culture of respect, accountability and gender equality at all levels of the organisation."</p>
      <p>Worrells Solvency and Forensic Accountants partner Aaron Lucan, the Sydney-based liquidator handling the wind-up of White Ribbon of Australia, said that since the charity shut its doors, there had been strong interest in reviving the White Ribbon brand.</p>

      <p>"It's not often that a liquidator can work toward an outcome of benefit to the wider community as well as to creditors, so on a personal level this is a very pleasing result," he said.</p>
      <p>Despite the assets sale, tax payers will foot the bill for entitlements owed by White Ribbon Australia to its 28 former employees, which have been referred to the federal government's Fair Entitlements Guarantee Scheme.</p>
      <p>The liquidators are also examining whether the company traded while insolvent.</p>
