      <h2>Hollywood actor and director has spoken out about the moment that he realised Leonardo DiCaprio was in grave danger during a diving expedition at the Galapagos Islands</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:06:36+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:06</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Edward Norton has spoken about the moment that he realised Leonardo DiCaprio was in grave danger and what he did to save his life during a diving expedition.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old Hollywood actor and director was with DiCarprio, 45, near the end of a trip with marine biologist Sylvia Earle in the Galapagos Islands.</p>
      <p>DiCaprio had dived back into the water to chase after a group of rays, when Norton, who is an experienced diver, realised the actor did not have enough oxygen to complete the dive and followed him.</p>
      <p>Speaking on The Jonathan Ross Show, Norton decided to set the record straight, saying there was "some truth to this story".</p>
      <p>"It has been pumped up a bit more than it deserves," he said.</p>

      <p>"We were in the Galapagos Islands. We were scuba diving with Sylvia Earle, the great oceanographer.</p>
      <p>"I've known Leo a long time and he loses his mind around animals. He really has a childlike passion for them.</p>
      <p>"This flight of 100 spotted eagle rays went by below us and I saw the look on his face.</p>
      <p>"I saw him charging off with this camera that he had and I have been diving since I was 16 years old. I reflectively looked at my watch and was like: 'We're very close to the end.'</p>
      <p>"I saw him going off and down and I knew that wasn't a good thing so I followed him because I thought to myself, he's chasing these things, he's going to run out of air - and he did."</p>

      <p>Norton appeared on the sofa with Robbie Williams, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/david-walliams">David Walliams</a> and the stars of Charlie's Angels. <br/>Norton also recalled acting in 2001's crime thriller The Score alongside Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro.</p>
      <p>He said: "That's one you do just because of the poster... Some things you do just for the story and for the experience."</p>
