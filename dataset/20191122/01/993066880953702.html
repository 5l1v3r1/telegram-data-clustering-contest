        <b>November 22 2009: Delaney bites back at Roy Keane</b>
      </p>
      <p>Football Association of Ireland chief executive John Delaney has described Roy Keane’s outburst against Ireland on Friday as “sad” and urged the former Republic of Ireland captain to “move on”.</p>
      <p>Ipswich Town manager Keane had little sympathy for the FAI’s campaign to have their controversial World Cup play-off against France replayed following Thierry Henry’s handball and said “what goes around comes around”.</p>
      <p>Keane’s antipathy towards the FAI stems back to the Pacific island of Saipan seven years ago, when he left the team’s pre-World Cup training camp, complaining that the facilities were sub-standard.</p>
      <p>“People seem to forget what was going on in that World Cup, and that man (FAI chief executive John Delaney) didn’t have the courtesy to ring me,” the former Sunderland manager said last week.</p>
      <p>However, Delaney hit back today saying that Keane should move on from the affair: “It’s just a side-show,” he said. “We’ve all moved on from Saipan.’’</p>
