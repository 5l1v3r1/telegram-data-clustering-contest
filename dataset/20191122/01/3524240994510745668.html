      <p><b>Inter</b> <b>coach </b>Antonio Conte received a letter threatening his daughter, but also staff member and former Juventus fitness coach Antonio Pintus.</p>
      <p>The letter, which has reportedly been traced back to Florence, contained a rifle cartridge and a threatening letter directed at the former Juventus coach with the text “we know where you live and who your daughter is.”</p>
      <p><i>La Stampa </i>reports that the local police in Milan has been in touch with Conte and he doesn’t recognise the writing, nor the content particularly reminding him of anyone. letter contained an eight-gauge cartridge, mainly used for hunting, and could be tracked back to Florence by the authorities.</p>
      <p>There’s a possible supporter of an opposing team, who is annoyed by the Inter side and their good performances this term, but also one from the Nerazzurri who doesn’t approve of his past in Turin.</p>
      <p>The letter contained writing in black, listing the names of his family members and the text, “We know where you live… We know who your daughter is.”</p>
      <p>However, the letter was sent to the Inter HQ and not directly to Conte’s home, which suggests the information about his address is incorrect.</p>
      <p>The police are investigating and will be analysing the document for fingerprints.</p>
      <p>Il Giorno reports that the first investigations aren’t connecting it to the world of the ultras, but rather a</p>
      <p>disgruntled individual seeking attention.</p>
