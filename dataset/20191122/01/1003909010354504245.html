      <h1>Nenshi sits down with PM, says there's 'willingness' to improve C-69</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:51:08+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:51</time> by <a rel="author">Meghan Potkins, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Calgary’s mayor says he had a “frank” conversation with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday about the frustrations of western Canadians, and came away hopeful that there could be a new willingness in Ottawa to improve legislation viewed as hostile to Alberta’s energy industry.</p>
      <p>“What I certainly heard is there was a willingness to make bill C-69 and C-48 better,” Nenshi told Postmedia following the meeting.</p>
      <p>“I think that the government really understands the challenges that are in front of them and the very real risk we have when it comes to western alienation, and that was really my goal.”</p>
      <p>Nenshi said Thursday’s meeting in the capital also touched on megaprojects including the Springbank Dam and Calgary’s Green Line LRT.</p>
      <p>The mayor also sat down with Manitoba MP Jim Carr, who was named this week as the prime minister’s special representative for the Prairies, and Chrystia Freeland, now deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs; as well as the newly appointed ministers of infrastructure and environment.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t walk away with any commitments, but I certainly heard a desire to move toward the exact same things that people like myself and Premier (Jason) Kenney have been advocating for,” said Nenshi.</p>
      <p>“The proof is in the pudding, but I felt that there was an opening there.”</p>

      <p>Nenshi’s discussions with Trudeau on C-69 — the federal Impact Assessment Act that critics have said would be a major obstacle to building new pipelines in Canada — followed a meeting the prime minister had last week with Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, where Trudeau first signalled his willingness to address the legislation.</p>
      <p>But while Nenshi, and others, would like to see it amended, that’s unlikely. The Liberals intend to try to tackle proposed changes via regulation and how the bill’s provisions are eventually implemented.</p>
      <p>Nenshi told reporters in Ottawa that he could live with that.</p>
      <p>“If there are things that can be done through regulation that achieve the same thing, I’m not going to get hung up on the parliamentary procedure,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I’m hung up on the results.”</p>
      <p>The mayor said he also received promising signals in response to Calgary’s plea to Ottawa for assistance on the Green Line.</p>
      <p>The city has asked the federal government to be more “flexible” on disbursement of its portion of the bill for the $4.9-billion project to <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/city-turns-to-ottawa-as-uncertainty-swirls-around-green-line-funding">compensate for significant funding delays at the provincial level</a>.</p>
      <p>“We talked a lot about the Green Line and how there is a win here to get that thing continuing on in its current trajectory — but it would require that the province and the federal government work together to find that win,” said Nenshi. “And that was actually very well received.”</p>

      <p>The meeting also included discussion of the <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/if-delays-persist-alternative-to-springbank-dam-possible-says-kenney">Springbank Dam</a>, a key flood mitigation project for Calgary that has been stalled at the environmental approval stage for years. Nenshi said Thursday that Bill C-69 won’t just hurt the energy industry, but could further delay critical infrastructure projects such as the dam.</p>
      <p>“The new legislation needs to be focused on getting to a decision more quickly, while respecting the needs to do environmental assessment and listening to the needs of Indigenous people in an authentic and consultative way,” said Nenshi.</p>
      <p>Trudeau and Calgary’s mayor also discussed issues surrounding western alienation.</p>
      <p>Nenshi emphasized that real concerns underpin the rhetoric coming from the West and warned about the “fragility” of national unity.</p>
      <p>“I’m not interested in raising the temperature, I’m not interested in being angry but I am interested in figuring out how we fix these very real problems.”</p>
