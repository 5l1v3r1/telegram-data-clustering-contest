      <p>Shifting of venues for competitions over lack of facilities continued on the third day of the Kozhikode district school arts festival on Thursday. If it was the rain on Wednesday that forced the organisers to change some of the venues, protests over lack of facilities by students, teachers, and parents were the reason in some others.</p>
      <p>The festival will conclude on Friday. Minister for Labour and Excise T.P. Ramakrishnan will open the valedictory ceremony at BEM Girls Higher Secondary School.</p>
      <p>The events scheduled to be held at the Mahila Mall ground had to be shifted to the Zamorin’s Higher Secondary School premises. Those planned at the Government Ganapath Boys High School were shifted to the auditorium at the Zamorin’s HSS and vice-versa. Bandmelam competition was shifted to St. Michael’s Higher Secondary School from Government Ganapath High School. Some events were shifted to the KSTA hall. The Kuchipudi competition scheduled at the Zamorin’s HSS had to be shifted to the Government Achuthan Girls Higher Secondary School after parents raised a hue and cry. Puddles were seen still seen next to the judges’ seats at some other venues.
