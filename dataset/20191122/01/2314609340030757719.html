      <h1>'Paramedics of homelessness': Suzanne's 14-day-plan to help families</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T01:29:23+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 01:29</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Koehn</a></address>
      <p>Watching the terror of a five-year-old girl from a homeless family made Suzanne Hopman decide Australia needed a new approach to accommodation for those without a home.</p>
      <p>"They had just checked into a really dingy hotel, it was like something out of a horror movie. I was taking small breaths so I didn’t breathe in the smell of the room," the chief executive of Sydney social enterprise Dignity told a crowd at the Telstra National Business Awards on Thursday evening.</p>

      <p>The small girl sat on the end of the bed, "so quietly, no tears, but a look in her eyes of pure terror I will never forget," Ms Hopman said.</p>
      <p>With two decades' experience in the not-for-profit and homelessness sector, Ms Hopman decided to develop a housing solution with a startup approach, with homes that were well-designed for short-term stays to offer an alternative to those bleak hotel rooms.</p>
      <p>Pledging to find families stable accommodation within 14 days of becoming homeless, Ms Hopman and co-founder Michelle Mulvihill launched a business focused on expanding corporate partnerships and involving the community to help achieve that.</p>
      <p>Over the past year Dignity has been able to move people into more stable situations within eight days, on average, Ms Hopman said.</p>

      <p>The founders leveraged corporate partnerships, philanthropy donations and government contracts to fund 25 crisis accommodation guest homes. Deals with other social enterprises like food waste prevention business OzHarvest have been used to supply ingredients for volunteer home cooks to deliver meals to the homes.</p>
      <p>Four years on from its launch, and having helped 50,000 homeless Australians, Dignity took out the top prize of Business of the Year at Telstra's annual national business awards this week.</p>
      <p>'"We are the paramedics of homelessness. The way we’ve approached it is from a very innovative mindset – harnessing all the modern technologies to throw at the problem. Social change is not for governments alone," Ms Hopman told <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i> and <i>The Age.</i></p>
      <h3>'It can happen to anyone'</h3>
      <p>The startup's accommodation and services are based in New South Wales, though the business is focused on breaking down incorrect assumptions about homelessness across the nation.</p>
      <p>"Homelessness does not discriminate: it can happen to anyone," Ms Hopman said.</p>
      <p>Dignity generated close to $1.5 million in income in 2018, according to its filings to the national charities register. It accepts donations, but the majority of its revenue comes from income related to its accommodation sites.</p>
      <p>The startup does not apply for government grants but instead has deals with government departments to provide and pilot new ideas for crisis accommodation.</p>
      <blockquote>We are the paramedics of homelessness. The way we’ve approached it is from a very innovative mindset.</blockquote>
      <p>It's one of a number of Australian businesses in recent months to <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5386h.html">highlight the importance of having strong companies that can use their profits to achieve social change.</a></p>
      <p>The company is a registered not-for-profit but operates like a traditional business, feeding any excess profits back into its projects.</p>
      <p>"It does require the business know-how. We approach it as though we want to be the absolute best and most efficient business that we can be," Ms Hopman said.</p>
      <p>"Every time we see someone in their new home is a time for celebration."</p>
