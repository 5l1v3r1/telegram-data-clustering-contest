      <p>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Norwegian officials say they have for a second time found the remains of what could be a Viking ship by using geo-radar techniques, adding it is likely more than 1,000 years old.</p>
      <p>Knut Paasche, an archaeologist with Norway’s Institute for Cultural Heritage Research, says a 13-meter (43-foot) long keel was spotted in September in a field that used to be a burial mound on the island of Edoeya about 110 kilometers (70 miles) west of Trondheim.</p>
      <p>Paasche said Friday that the ship could be up to 17 meters (56 feet) long. There are no immediate plans to unearth it.</p>
      <p>The Viking era was approximately 793-1066.</p>
      <p>In March, a ship was found buried west of Oslo using geo-radar — a geophysical method that uses radar pulses to image the subsurface.</p>
