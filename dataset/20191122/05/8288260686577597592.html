      <p>West Midlands Mayor Andy Street says there must be a public inquiry into the Birmingham pub bombings.</p>
      <p> Speaking at last night’s memorial service, he said:  “We come together with the victims’ families, many of whom are here today, but also with the people of Birmingham. Our city remains wounded by what happened on that fateful night.</p>
      <p>“I know that’s still the case as since I’ve been Mayor I have joined the families on this day every year, and each year the sadness and anger grows that justice has still not yet been served.</p>

      <p>I remember well, as a youngster in Birmingham in 1974, that my mum was called into work that evening at East Birmingham Hospital. And over the following months there were community tensions and a feeling of unease, sadness and horror that this could possibly have happened here.</p>
      <p>“Those who lost their lives were all younger than I am now. With so much to look forward to, their dreams and aspirations were snatched away in an instant.</p>
      <p>“45 years on, and this remains the largest unsolved murder in the United Kingdom’s recent history. As far as we know, the perpetrators of this heinous crime are left free to live their lives. The 21 killed when the bombs went off at the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town are not.</p>
      <p>“Nothing we say or do can bring those innocent victims back, but we can still try to achieve justice for their families, and for a city that has many unanswered questions.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Of course we had the coroner’s inquest earlier this year which was unable to provide answers as to who the perpetrators were – despite ruling that the 21 were killed unlawfully. An active police investigation remains open.</p>
      <p>“But we face another anniversary where we are still without closure for the families, a situation I have discussed with the last three Home Secretaries.</p>
      <p>“Against that background I have now come to the conclusion that the time is right for a panel-led, open public inquiry into the pub bombings.</p>
      <p>“I am determined that, after the General Election, I will resume the conversation with whoever becomes the Home Secretary. I have already explained this to Priti Patel. As with the Hillsborough tragedy, it looks likely that only a public inquiry will provide the answers that the families deserve.</p>

      <p>“The pub bombings remain the darkest night in Birmingham’s recent history, and, despite a huge reconciliation effort, we now need full closure, especially for the bereaved’s families and everyone affected. It is with them and with the spirit of reconciliation we stand in solidarity tonight.</p>
      <h3>he pub bombings</h3>
      <p>On November 21, 1974, IRA bombers blew up two city centre bars within 50 yards of each other.</p>
      <p>The Mulberry Bush, at the base of The Rotunda, and The Tavern In The Town were destroyed in the explosions which left 21 people dead.</p>
      <p>Another 200 people were wounded, some with life-changing injuries.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, a full inquest was finally held after a long battle by the Justice4the21 campaign group, supported by the Birmingham Mail.</p>
      <p>* The inquest jury determined that the victims were unlawfully killed.</p>
      <p>A flawed investigation by West Midlands Police led to the 1975 wrongful convictions of the Birmingham Six, but their convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal in 1991.</p>
      <p>No-one has since been bought to justice.</p>
