      <p>In its bid to attract global influence to Caribbean shores, TechBeach Retreat has successfully landed a headline sponsorship with global tech giant Google for the upcoming staging in Montego Bay at Iberostar from December 5 to 7.</p>
      <p>Google, one of the world’s largest tech companies and the world’s foremost search engine, is seeking to expand the reach of its products and invite Caribbean nationals and more diverse ­audiences to build on the company’s infrastructure, yielding new products and enterprises.</p>
      <p>The company will be represented by a large contingent of executives during TechBeach Retreat. One of the key representatives who will speak on behalf of the tech company is Annie Jean-Baptiste, Google’s head of product-inclusion, research, and activation. Jean-Baptiste leads product ­inclusion strategy across the company, ­including consultation, communications, scale, and research.</p>
      <p>With a passion for diversity and equity, Jean-Baptiste then transitioned to the global diversity and inclusion team and works to make Google a place where everyone is championed for their differences.</p>
      <p>She currently leads strategy and execution of the building inclusive products for all users, a marriage of her business and diversity backgrounds. Jean-Baptiste also leads the strategy around expansion for the ‘business case for inclusion’ by leading the end to end engagement strategy for Google’s senior most leaders.</p>
      <p>Leveraging her key relationships with teams across Google, she creates and oversees the end-to-end product inclusion consultation/implementation strategies in areas such as user research, PM, design, marketing, and more, and helps those teams embed these practices into their core business planning.</p>
      <p>Jean-Baptiste will be joined by Alan Tetley, director of software engineering at Google. Tetley leads a team of engineers that deliver the search experience on Android. The session is titled ‘Build for Everyone’ and will be a fireside chat hosted by Suezette Yasmin Robotham, diversity, equity, and inclusion programme manager, Google Search and Assistant.</p>
