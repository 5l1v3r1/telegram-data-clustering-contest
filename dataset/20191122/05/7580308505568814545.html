        <b>– Matthijs De Ligt hits back at Kluivert</b>
      </p>
      <p>Juventus defender Matthijs de Ligt has hit back at claims from Holland legend Patrick Kluivert that he regrets leaving Ajax for Serie A giants Juventus.</p>
      <p>De Ligt has played all but three Serie A matches this season but came in for criticism after Juve’s draw with Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, while the Italian press has also been quick to suggest he has not recaptured last season’s Ajax form.</p>
      <p>But the 20-year-old De Ligt insists he is happy with his start to life in Italy.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t regret the fact that I have moved to Juventus,’ the 21-year-old told Voetbal Primeur. ‘They are saying and writing a lot of stuff.</p>
      <p>‘If a person like Kluivert says something like that, it might seem true, but it really is just his assumption.’</p>
      <p>Barcelona academy director Kluivert, speaking to Mundo Deportivo, had said about his compatriot: ‘I didn’t personally try to convince him about joining Barcelona.</p>
      <p>‘I only told him about the positive aspects of Barcelona as a club and city.</p>
      <p>‘We are obviously talking about a great defender and in the end he made a choice. I think he slightly regrets it now, but that’s the way it is.</p>
      <p>‘In life, you must make choices, sometimes good ones and sometimes bad. You have to learn from your decisions.’</p>
      <p>De Ligt decided to join Juventus ahead of the likes of Barcelona, Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain last summer after his stock had risen at Ajax.</p>
      <p>His former team-mate and close friend Frenkie de Jong took up Barcelona’s offer but De Ligt turned down the opportunity to follow.</p>
      <p>The young defender has made 12 competitive appearances for the Old Lady since his £67.8million move from his native Holland.</p>
      <p>Juventus are unbeaten in 12 Serie A matches so far this season and resume domestic action against Atalanta tomorrow.</p>
