      <h1>Samoa climate change resilience challenges Western perceptions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">University of Otago</a></address>
      <p>The resilience of Samoan communities in the face of climate change is providing a blueprint for other nations to follow, according to Samoa and Otago researchers.</p>
      <p>It is one of the first studies to examine Samoa's grassroots ability to adapt to climate change, and its authors warn officials risk ignoring village expertise at their peril.</p>
      <p>The newly-released paper is co-authored by Dr Anita Latai-Niusulu from the National University of Samoa, and University of Otago Professors Tony Binns and Etienne Nel, both from the School of Geography.</p>
      <p>The study, based on Dr Latai-Niusulu's PhD thesis, interviewed 165 residents in villages across Samoa's main islands Upolu and Savaii, including in coastal, inland, urban and rural areas.</p>
      <p>More than 70 per cent of Samoa's population lives in 330 rural villages across Upolu and Savaii, and most of the country's infrastructure, population and development is near the coastline.</p>
      <p>The researchers found villagers had a heightened awareness of climate change and noticed hotter days and longer dry spells, shorter periods of rainfall, stronger damaging winds, and sea level rise.</p>
      <p>However rather than despairing at the prospect, villagers have developed a pragmatic and positive approach to impending climate changes.</p>
      <p>Past natural disasters such as Cyclones Ofa and Val in the 1990s had a devastating effect on many communities, but the recovery period also brought opportunities for developing tighter social connections, new food supplies and infrastructural development and, in some cases, village relocation.</p>
      <p>Professor Binns says the Samoan approach challenges general Western perceptions about Pacific nations' ability to respond to climate change.</p>
      <p>He says exposure to serious environmental challenges has not made villagers 'fatalistic' or 'helpless', but instead has given them a more optimistic outlook on life.</p>
      <p>The close-knit Samoan village structure, with a village council (fono) made up of chiefly title holders (matai) from extended family units throughout the village, means that each villager has a voice at the local decision table.</p>
      <p>Communities also regularly meet together at evening prayers to share information and strengthen social networks.</p>
      <p>This, along with the fact that more than 80 per cent of Samoa's land and resources are still collectively owned, means Samoans can engage in collaborative action against climate change.</p>
      <p>Common strategies in all villages include diversifying food and water sources, being geographically mobile, having more than one place to live, and developing mental and spiritual strength.</p>
      <p>"Such diverse livelihood portfolios and close community collaboration have generated an impressive level of resilience which communities elsewhere in the Pacific and beyond could well emulate," Professor Binns says.</p>
      <p>However, the study found climate change decisions in Samoa are primarily occurring at a national level, and are dominated by the views of government workers, consultancy firms and civil society workers.</p>
      <p>Officials need to listen to community expertise and develop a more nuanced understanding of each village's key concerns - which vary according each village's unique geographical challenges, Professor Binns says.</p>
      <p>"Governments need to carefully reconsider their expenditure in relation to climate change adaptation, with perhaps less spending directed towards building seawalls and coastal roads.</p>
      <p>"More support should be given to other climate change adaptation initiatives such as village, church and family activities that strengthen social networks and build social memory."</p>
