      <p>Grace Millane's parents have paid tribute to their 'talented and beautiful' girl after a 27-year-old man was convicted of her murder.</p>
      <p>Her dad David Millane delivered an heartbreaking speech to reporters outside Auckland High Court, following the unanimous verdict.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the media as he stood next to his wife, Gillian, Mr Millane described his 22-year-old daughter as their 'sunshine' and said she did not deserve to be murdered in such a 'barbaric' way.</p>
      <p>The British backpacker's parents have sat in court for the past three weeks listening to the harrowing details of their daughter's case.</p>
      <p>They both broke down in tears - along with members of the jury - when the guilty verdict was announced today.</p>

      <p>Speaking outside the court, David said: "The verdict of murder today will be welcomed by every member of the Millane family and friends of Grace.</p>
      <p>"It will not reduce the pain and suffering we have had to endure over the past year. Grace was taken in the most brutal fashion a year ago and our lives have been ripped apart.</p>
      <p>"This will be with us for the rest of our lives. Grace was a beautiful, talented, loving daughter. Grace was our sunshine and she will be missed forever. She did not deserve to be murdered in such a barbaric way on her gap year.</p>
      <p>"We must return home and try and pick up the pieces of our lives... without our beloved Grace."</p>

      <p>He thanked the people of New Zealand for 'opening their hearts' to Grace and her family.</p>
      <p>Grace was killed when she returned to her murderer's hotel room in Auckland, New Zealand, last December.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claimed he deliberately strangled her, although he argued that Grace had died accidentally during rough sex.</p>
      <p>Auckland High Court heard how the man Googled 'flesh-eating birds' and 'are there vultures in New Zealand' as he researched how to dispose of her body.</p>

      <p>He then bought two suitcases and stuffed her body into one of them, before burying it in a shallow grave outside Auckland.</p>
      <p>The defendant also arranged another Tinder date while Grace lay dead in his hotel room.</p>
      <p>His defence team said he panicked after finding Grace dead in his room and buried her body because he did not think anyone would believe he was innocent of murder.</p>
      <p>The jury at Auckland High Court pronounced their verdict after little more than five hours deliberations at the end of a three week trial.</p>
      <p>At 5.45pm local time, they filed into the jury box.</p>
      <p>The killer, whose identity remains protected, remained impassive before he was led away to the cells.</p>
      <p>He was then brought back to the dock, wearing a dark suit and black open necked shirt, to be told by Judge Simon Moore that he would be sentenced on February 21 next year.</p>
      <p>Graceâ€™s mother Gill broke into silent sobs as the verdict was read but recovered her composure to be comforted by her husband David, a property developer from Wickford, Essex.</p>
      <p>Members of the jury also broke down in tears, according to <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/117069680/grace-millane-murder-trial-latest-updates?cid=app-iPhone">Stuff</a> .</p>
      <p>The New Zealand news site reported that the killer showed no emotions as the verdict was delivered.</p>
