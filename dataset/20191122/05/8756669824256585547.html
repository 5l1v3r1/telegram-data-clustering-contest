      <h1>Hyundai i30 N to gain eight-speed dual-clutch gearbox ... and more power!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:32:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.carmag.co.za/author/ryanbubear/" target="_blank">Ryan Bubear</a></address>
      <p>A high-ranking Hyundai executive has confirmed the <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/new-models/new-hyundai-i30-n-hot-hatch-revealed-with-202-kw/">i30 N</a> will gain an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission and “a little bit more power” when it is facelifted in 2020.</p>
      <p>The current model – which is finally set to arrive in <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/hyundai-i30-n-for-south-africa-more-details-emerge-ahead-of-launch/">South Africa</a> in limited numbers towards the end of January 2020 – is powered by a 2,0-litre turbocharged engine worth up to 202 kW (with the Performance Package specified) and 353 N.m. Drive is directed to the front wheels via a six-speed manual gearbox as standard.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/809426/hyundai-i30n-automatic/"><i>CarAdvice</i></a>, Albert Biermann, head of global research and development for Hyundai Motor Company, suggested the hot hatch was in line for a mid-cycle update at some point next year, with the <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/hyundai-i30-n-eight-speed-dual-clutch-confirmed/">long-awaited</a> self-shifting gearbox arriving at the same time.</p>
      <p>“When the eight-speed wet double-clutch comes, we will crank a little bit more power out of it,” Biermann told the publication.</p>
      <p>“When we add the double-clutch transmission that will have a strong impact on the i30 N, because it is not a normal automatic transmission; this is something really special,” he added.</p>
      <p>Biermann went on to suggest he didn’t think there was “a need to do anything to the chassis” for the facelift, before confirming the Korean firm was already working on the next-generation version.</p>
      <p>“Of course there will be a next i30 N. I cannot tell you when and what it will be, but of course we are working on it, on concepts already.”</p>
