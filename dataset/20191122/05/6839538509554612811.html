      <p>A man who left a five-week-old baby blind and paralysed after shaking it has now been charged with manslaughter after the boy died in October.</p>
      <p>Brandon Lee Harris, 23, was <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/93549189b220b44146e60ec1b48d3557">jailed for four years</a>, with a non-parole period of 18 months, for shaking the child, leaving the five-week-old with critical injuries.</p>
      <p>The baby died in August this year after being kept alive on life support.</p>
      <p>Police have charged Harris with manslaughter.</p>
      <p>Harris took the baby to Wallaroo Hospital in May 2018, telling doctors that the child had hit his head on the arm of a chair during a feed.</p>
      <p>A doctor noted that the child “looked unwell” and had dilated pupils, irregular breathing and a bruise on his wrist.</p>
      <p>The child was later treated at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital where a paediatrician found that the baby had suffered a “significant neurological impairment” and required resuscitation as a result of the heard trauma.</p>
      <p>The doctor concluded that the injuries, which included haemorrhaging, swelling and bleeding on the brain, were likely caused by forceful shaking.</p>
      <p>Harris admitted that he had twice shaken the baby because he would not settle at night.</p>
      <p>He also said he had shoved a bottle into the baby’s mouth in frustration, possibly causing an injury to his tongue and lip as well as his collarbone.</p>
      <p>The child was diagnosed with quadriplegia, epilepsy and clinical blindness as a result of the shaking and was kept alive on life support.</p>
      <p>Harris was sentenced in July after pleading guilty to aggravated recklessly causing serious harm.</p>
      <p>He was charged with manslaughter shortly after the child died in August.</p>
      <p>He will face court in the new year.</p>
