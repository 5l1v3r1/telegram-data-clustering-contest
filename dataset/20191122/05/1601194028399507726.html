      <p>A member of The Elite could be coming home to <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/all-elite-wrestling">AEW</a>. According to <a href="https://wrestletalk.com/news/rumor-marty-scurll-to-wwe-not-likely">WrestleTalk</a>, Dave Meltzer of <a href="https://www.f4wonline.com/">WON</a> is reporting that <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/marty-scrull">Marty Scurll</a> is deciding between two promotions and neither of them is WWE. AEW or NJPW will be the likely destinations with All Elite Wrestling being the most likely choice.</p>
      <p>For a long time, Marty Scurll made frequent appearances on Being The Elite and still featured in the opening credits of the show on YouTube. When AEW started, Scurll was on a different contract than the rest of his Elite brethren, who all went to AEW.</p>
      <p>They even made a sketch on Being The Elite about it, when neither Cody or The Young Bucks came to Scurll's new years party and he got intoxicated by himself.</p>

      <p>In interviews since then, Marty Scurll has made references to AEW, in some cases saying he's never heard of the company and in others, he says that his friends are all dead. In an interview with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/wrestling/marty-scurll-everyone-agrees-should-20307575">The Mirror</a> (H/T <a href="https://411mania.com/wrestling/marty-scurll-everyone-agrees-i-should-have-won-the-roh-title">411 Mania</a>), he reiterated that sentiment.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>"All my friends are dead. What the **** is AEW?‚Äù</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>He even ran into Joey Janela at an independent show, trying to recruit him to join Villain Enterprises, only to see Janela turn him down.</p>

      <p>While the bread crumbs have been laid over the course of the year, there is still a possibility that he could still sign with NJPW, as there is still interest in working with them. On the WWE question, while Scurll does live in Florida and that he would be the top star in NXT, it's the least likely that this could happen.</p>
      <p>It should also be noted that Scurll does own the Villain Enterprises trademark and would bring that with him to AEW if he does sign with them.</p>
      <p>There's an already inbuilt storyline of Scurll wanting revenge on his former friends leaving him behind. It may not happen right away, but it's something to think about.</p>
