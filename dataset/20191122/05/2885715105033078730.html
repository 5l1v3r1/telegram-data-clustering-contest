      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:35:33+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/ajay-jadhav/" target="_blank">Ajay Jadhav</a></address>
      <p>The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to develop a separate facility at the civic-run Vaikunth crematorium complex, to allow more people to attend the last rites of prominent personalities.</p>
      <p>“The Standing Committee gave its consent to a proposal for development work at Vaikunth crematorium with MLA area development fund,” said Sunil Kamble, chairperson of the PMC Standing Committee.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, the PMC is planning to develop infrastructure in an open space at Vaikunth crematorium, which will have three open facilities for cremation and a space with sitting facility.</p>
      <p>“With the new infrastructure, more people will be able to attend the last rites of prominent personalities in the open facility… it will allow local residents to watch the cremation easily…,” it said.</p>
      <p>The new construction will have a built-up area of 3,625 sq metre and include a platform for cremation, a pathway and a sitting gallery. Former MLA Girish Bapat, who is now the city MP, had allocated Rs 50 lakh for the project.</p>
      <p>The crematorium falls in the jurisdiction of Kasba seat, which Bapat had represented in the state Assembly for a long time.</p>
      <p>The PMC had renovated Vaikunth crematorium, located on a 17-acre piece of land near Mutha river, at a cost of Rs 1.87 crore a few years ago.</p>
      <p>The facility currently has three electric crematoriums, one gas crematorium, 26 platforms with a shade and 10 open platforms for cremations.</p>
      <p>“The facilities in Vaikunth crematorium complex are better compared to other crematoriums… it is also located in the heart of the city,” said a civic official.</p>
