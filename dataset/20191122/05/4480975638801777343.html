      <p>Westpac’s Bill Evans keeps his view of a rate cut in February intact while also looking forward to the next week’s speech by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe’s speech.</p>
      <h3>Key quotes</h3>
      <p>"The minutes of the November <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">monetary policy</a> meeting of the Reserve Bank Board give us no significant reason to change our view that the next rate cut will occur in February."</p>
      <p>"While some forecasters have been promoting the idea of a move in December, the minutes provided the flavour of a Board that is in no hurry to make the next cut."</p>
      <p>"Nevertheless, the minutes do not want to leave the reader in any doubt that the Board continues to have a clear easing bias."</p>
      <p>"Some commentaries interpreted the latter remark as indicating that the Board was close to cutting rates at the meeting. However, my view is that it was used to emphasise a strong easing bias, particularly aimed at containing any upward drift in the AUD rather than any serious risk of an unexpected move in November."</p>
