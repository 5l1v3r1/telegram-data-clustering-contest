      <p>The chargesheet filed by the CBI against lawyer Sanjeev Punalekar and Sanatan Sanstha member Vikram Bhave in the Narendra Dabholkar murder case is devoid of any logical basis and is not supported by evidence, according to their defence lawyer, advocate Virendra Ichalkaranjikar.</p>
      <p>The CBI had on Wednesday filed a supplementary chargesheet against two of the accused in the case — Punalekar and his aide Bhave — who were arrested in May this year for allegedly being part of the conspiracy to kill the 67-year-old anti-superstition activist in August 2013.</p>
      <p>Punalekar has also been accused by the CBI of advising Sharad Kalaskar, one of the two alleged shooters of Dabholkar, to destroy four firearms, including those used in the murder of Dabholkar and the 2017 murder of journalist <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/who-is/gauri-lankesh-senior-journalist-bengaluru-lankesh-patrike-4830415/">Gauri Lankesh</a> in Bengaluru.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a></i> has reported that among other points, the CBI’s case relies on Kalaskar’s confessional statement to Karnataka Police in the Lankesh murder case and the Forensic Psychological Assessment of some of the accused in the case, including Punalekar.<br/>Ichalkaranjikar, who is representing both Punalekar and Bhave, is the president of the Hindu Vidhidnya Parishad, a lawyers’ body of which Punalekar is the national secretary.</p>
      <p>According to the CBI chargesheet, both Punalekar and Bhave are members of Sanatan Sanstha.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>The Indian Express</i>, Ichalkaranjikar said on Thursday, “While a statement by an accused cannot be a strong point to base the case on, even if we consider Kalaskar’s statement as put forward by the CBI to be true for the sake of argument, it is rife with missing links. It does not explain how a weapon allegedly used in 2013 suddenly resurfaces in 2018. There is no independent third witness that corroborates Kalaskar’s meeting with Punalekar. These charges are devoid of logical basis.”</p>
      <p>On the Forensic Psychological Assessment, Ichalkaranjikar said, “In the case of Selvi Vs State of Karnataka, the honourable Supreme Court has ruled that such tests cannot be used as evidence. This Forensic Psychological Assessment is nothing but a psychiatrist asking some questions to the subject and then giving an opinion on it. These opinions are very subjective.”</p>
      <p>The CBI, in its chargesheet, refers to a letter Punalekar had written to Dabholkar in 2012, opposing the activist’s views on Ganesh idol visarjan leading to water pollution.</p>
      <p>Ichalkaranjikar said, “In that letter, Punalekar had written to Dabholkar that the latter was speaking about pollution caused by one particular religion. But the practices from other religions also lead to pollution. Punalekar had expressed his wish to work with Dabholkar on pollution caused by religious practices. How can such a letter be a basis for motive? These things are not supported by evidence.”</p>
      <p>Ichalkaranjikar claimed that the agency didn’t have any concrete proof against Bhave, who allegedly played a key role in the conspiracy by facilitating the reconnaissance and escape of the shooters. Bhave is also a convict in the 2008 Thane bomb blasts case and was released on bail in 2013. He had been assisting Punalekar in his legal work.</p>
      <p>Before his arrest, Punalekar had legally represented several Sanatan Sanstha members and Hindutva activists accused in other cases. He had not only appeared for some of the accused in the Dabholkar murder case but also defended all of them in the media.</p>
      <h3>What is Hindu Vidhidnya Parishad?</h3>
      <p>Hindu Vidhidnya Parishad is a body of lawyers that has given legal representation to members of many Hindu outfits in the past. Punalekar, the national secretary of the organisation, has represented the accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case, the accused in the 2014 Mohsin Shaikh murder case and even the accused in the Dabholkar murder case.</p>
      <p>The web page of the organisation, on the website of Hindu Janajagruti Samiti, states, “The Hindu Vidhidnya Parishad was formed in the first Hindu Summit organised by Hindus held at Goa in 2012, with a vow to help the Hindu cause and Hindutva activists in the best manner possible. Unfortunately, advocates strive for their individual growth and practice, but not for the society. Hindu activism needs many lawyers who will fight for the cause of dharma. Their participation is required as activist lawyers and not only as lawyers. The Hindu Vidhidnya Parishad is an organisation of such activist lawyers who want to support the cause of dharma and the Hindu activists who are selflessly working for Hindutva.”</p>
      <p>The web page adds, “We can’t stop our legal battles fought using the current legal structures (rather situation of chaos) till we establish Hindu rashtra and create a legal system of our own based on spiritual science. The Hindu Vidhidnya Parishad wants to establish the laws formulated by experimenting with the eternal science of spirituality which are embedded in Sanatan Hindu Dharma. This can’t be done unless constitutional battles are fought in the courts and legal agitations on legal points are made on the roads. Hindu Vidhidnya Parishad is for both.”</p>
