      <p>The girls’ team has Sukurat Aiyelabegan, Rofiat Jimoh, Iyanuoluwa Falana and Vivian Oku and they will be joined in the tournament by the Egyptian team led by 11-year-old Hana Goda who recently won the cadet title at the Portugal Open.</p>
      <p>According to the boys’ singles seeding list released by the world table tennis ruling body, Nigeria’s Solanke is the best rated African player seeded 35th among the 80 players in the seeding list.</p>
      <p>Solanke who was part of the Nigerian team to the 2019 Team World Cup in Tokyo, Japan, believes the experience of playing alongside Aruna Quadri would be handy for him in Thailand.</p>
      <p>“I leant a lot from being part of the team to Tokyo. Even though I did not play but watching the likes of</p>
      <p>Quadri playing against the best in the world has improved my knowledge of the sport and also boosted</p>
      <p>my confidence going to the world juniors,” Solanke said.</p>
