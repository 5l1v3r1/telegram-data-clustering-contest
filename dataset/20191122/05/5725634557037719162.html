          <b>Foreword</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>To quote a comment from a reader of August's high-yield, low-priced dividend dog list, this is "dangerous advice." Hence it is to be used at your own risk.</p>
      <p>I have always advised that high dividends are a sure sign of high risk. Combine that signal with a low-price offer and you have the stuff of legends and horror stories. Especially in light of Y Charts declaration that YCharts allows a dividend yield to persist for 365 days after the most recent reported dividend if a dividend is cut. Therefore, a few line items you see calculated here could be inaccurate.</p>
      <p>This November list has pared down to half the size of October's by rejecting stocks reporting annual returns lower than -25% and any with yields greater than 30% were removed as unsustainable.</p>
      <p>Happy hunting but beware of the numbers put up by the top ten by yield on this list of 43. In short, this is risky business. These are Dogs of the Low, not of the Dow.</p>
      <p>
        <b><b>Actionable Conclusions (1-10): Brokers Calculated 28.37% To 89.96% Net Gains For Ten</b> <b>&gt;10%Yield@&lt;$10 Priced</b><b> Stocks By November 20, 2020</b></b>
      </p>
      <p>One of ten top yield &gt;10%Yield@&lt;$10 Priced dogs were among the top ten gainers for the coming year (based on analyst 1-year targets). So, this forecast, as graded by Wall St. Brokers, was 10% accurate.</p>
      <p>Projections based on dividends from $1000 invested in the highest yielding stocks and aggregate one-year analyst median target prices of those stocks, as reported by YCharts, created the 2020 data points. Note: one-year target prices from single analysts were not applied (n/a). Ten projected profit-generating trades to November 20, 2020, were:</p>

          <b>The Dividend Dogs Rule</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Stocks earned the "dog" moniker by exhibiting three traits: (1) paying reliable, repeating dividends, (2) their prices fell to where (3) yield (dividend/price) grew higher than their peers. Thus, the highest yielding stocks in any collection became known as "dogs." More precisely, these are, in fact, best called, "underdogs."</p>

      <p>Top ten &gt;10%Yield@&lt;$10 Priced dogs selected 11/20/19 by yield represented six of eleven Morningstar sectors.</p>

      <p>To quantify top yield rankings, analyst median price target estimates provided a "market sentiment" gauge of upside potential. Added to the simple high-yield metrics, analyst mean price target estimates became another tool to dig out bargains.</p>

The eighth lowest priced &gt;10%Yield@&lt;$10 Priced dog, CONSOL Coal Resources LP, was projected by analysts to deliver the best net gain of 96.16%.</p>

      <p>The five lowest-priced top &gt;10%Yield@&lt;$10 Priced dogs as of November 20 were: Yanzhou Coal Mining Co Ltd.; Medical Facilities Corp.; Oxford Square Capital Corp.; MV Oil Trust; Shougang Concord International Enterprises Co. Ltd. (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCGEY">OTCPK:SCGEY</a>), with prices ranging from $1.02 to $5.48.</p>
      <p>Five higher-priced &gt;10%Yield@&lt;$10 Priced dogs from November 20 were: Surgutneftegas PJSC; CESP - Cia Energetica de Sao Paulo; CONSOL Coal Resources LP; Cia de Transmissao de Energia Eletrica Paulista (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTPTY">OTCPK:CTPTY</a>); USD Partners LP, whose prices ranged from $5.87 to $9.50.</p>
      <p>The distinction between five low-priced dividend dogs and the general field of ten reflected Michael B. O'Higgins' "basic method" for beating the Dow. The scale of projected gains based on analyst targets added a unique element of "market sentiment" gauging upside potential. It provided a here-and-now equivalent of waiting a year to find out what might happen in the market. Caution is advised, since analysts are historically only 20% to 80% accurate on the direction of change and just 0% to 20% accurate on the degree of change.</p>
      <p>The net gain/loss estimates above did not factor in any foreign or domestic tax problems resulting from distributions. Consult your tax advisor regarding the source and consequences of "dividends" from any investment.</p>

Here is their dividend yield statement: "2) We allow a dividend yield to persist for 365 days after the most recent reported dividend if a dividend is cut.

For true historical testing purposes, one would need the date the company announced a cut or increase in the dividend to get the proper expected dividend yield as of a given date."<br/><br/>"The forward yield won't catch changes as there is not an automated method for turning those announcements into that kind of data. A specific use case would require additional over-site after the screening had taken place to catch these instances. I wish there was an easier way, and I will submit feedback, but as of yet this has been how we've always done things for lack of a better method."</p>
