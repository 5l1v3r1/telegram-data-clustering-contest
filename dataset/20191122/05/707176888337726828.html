      <h1>Hargreaves hit by transfer backlog in wake of Neil Woodford crisis</h1>
      <h2>Rival platforms report longer than usual waiting times to switch</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:00:53+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Siobhan Riding</a></address>
      <p>Hargreaves Lansdown customers aggrieved by the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2f077ae2-f19e-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901">Woodford crisis </a>are being forced to wait up to two months to transfer their assets to rival platforms, as the UK’s largest fund supermarket struggles through a backlog of requests.</p>
      <p>Three of the platform’s closest rivals — Interactive Investor, AJ Bell and Bestinvest, — have all independently told FT Money that wait times for customers transferring investments to their platforms from Hargreaves have dramatically increased since the summer.</p>
      <p>In some cases, transfers are taking six weeks longer than usual. In October, Hargreaves informed one of the rival platforms that it had a backlog dating back to the end of August, leaving affected customers waiting for more than a month before their requests were even looked at.</p>
      <p>Richard Wilson, chief executive of Interactive Investor, the UK’s second-largest DIY investment platform, said: “We have noticed a backlog in transfers from Hargreaves in the past few months. It is taking Hargreaves on average 8.8 weeks — or 44 working days — which is two and a half times slower than other platforms.”</p>
      <p>AJ Bell, the UK’s fifth-largest DIY investment platform, said: “Transfers from Hargreaves Lansdown are taking longer than normal. The main issue seems to be around the transfer of shares via self invested personal pensions (Sipps), and individual savings accounts (Isas). We are doing everything we can to speed these up for customers but obviously we are only one half of the equation.”</p>
      <p>Bestinvest also said that transfers from Hargreaves customers were taking longer due to a backlog “of a few weeks”.</p>
      <p>In response, Hargreaves said that it did not have a backlog across the board, but that there had been “a few case studies where there are specific complexities which have delayed transfer times”. It added that it had not experienced an increase in customers requesting to switch over the past six months.</p>
      <p>Reports of delays come after Hargreaves was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b51a209e-f646-46e3-b123-0b1924f887b6">drawn into </a>the crisis engulfing former star stockpicker Neil Woodford after almost 300,000 of its customers were trapped in his collapsed funds.</p>
      <p>The fund supermarket drew <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/92cf6a08-f02c-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901">intense criticism</a> from customers and policymakers for continuing to promote Mr Woodford’s flagship Equity Income fund until the day it was suspended this summer due to liquidity concerns, trapping £3bn of investors’ money.</p>
      <p>Several rival platforms say they have since seen an uptick in transfer requests from Hargreaves customers as disillusioned Woodford investors, who are expected to lose at least <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a025e93a-0601-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd">one-third of their savings</a> according to a recent estimate, look for a new home.</p>
      <p>Interactive Investor’s Mr Wilson warned that long waiting times for transfers could cause further problems. If investors embarked on a cash transfer — meaning they cashed out of their investments and bought them again when the money landed at their new provider — there would be an opportunity cost of spending so many weeks out of the market.</p>
      <p>He added that some investors may even be prompted to cancel their switch in frustration at the delays, undermining competition and consumer choice.</p>
      <p>The complaints against Hargreaves come as pressure builds on the investment industry to reduce barriers that may be <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/77722d5c-7a36-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560">preventing investors from transferring</a> to get a better deal.</p>
      <p>Consumers switching a bank account are protected by the “seven-day switching guarantee”, but there is no set time limit for investment platforms to facilitate transfers. HM Revenue &amp; Customs says cash Isas should take no longer than 15 days to transfer while stocks and shares Isas should take no longer than 30 working days. According to the Financial Conduct Authority, pension and Isa switches should generally take about two weeks.</p>
      <p>In its <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/00fb064c-8902-11e8-b18d-0181731a0340">interim report</a> into the investment platform industry last year, the Financial Conduct Authority said it wanted platforms to speed up transfer times and tackle <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b91c0eba-462b-11e9-a965-23d669740bfb">high exit fees</a>. In March, the regulator threatened to act against platforms if they failed to improve by 2020.</p>
      <p>Hargreaves has responded to some of the criticisms recently by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e166529a-db90-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17">scrapping exit fees</a> and resolving a share-class restriction that initially <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ea3af2f0-a241-11e9-a282-2df48f366f7d">blocked</a> investors in the suspended Woodford fund from transferring their holdings to rival platforms.</p>
      <p>Despite this, critics say little progress has been made on the speed of transfers between platforms and argue that the FCA should force companies to reveal data on transfer times. The regulator has so far declined to intervene, instead calling on the industry to regulate itself via a not-for-profit joint venture known as <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-acts-improve-competition-investment-platforms-market">Star</a> aimed at agreeing uniform standards on transfer times and processes.</p>
      <p>Many of the largest platforms, including Hargreaves, Interactive Investor and AJ Bell, have signed up to Star and its guidelines. However, Mr Wilson said there had been “no tangible outcomes” from Star so far, which he blamed on the voluntary nature of the initiative and that it “lacked teeth”.</p>
