      <h1>Yuan set for 2 straight weeks of decline as trade caution prevails</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:14:06+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:14</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>SHANGHAI — China’s yuan eased on Friday</p>
      <p>and is set for its second straight weekly loss as investors grew</p>
      <p>increasingly cautious about developments in the negotiations</p>
      <p>between the world’s two largest economies.</p>
      <p>The currency’s movements in recent months have mostly been</p>
      <p>driven by the twists and turns in bilateral talks between China</p>
      <p>and the United States and are now shrouded by doubts over</p>
      <p>whether the sides can strike a preliminary agreement any time</p>
      <p>soon.</p>
      <p>However, negotiations could now become more complicated with</p>
      <p>U.S. President Donald Trump expected to sign into law two bills</p>
      <p>backing protesters in Hong Kong, traders said.</p>
      <p>“The Hong Kong human rights bill remains a wild card for the</p>
      <p>market, which may also complicate the trade talks,” OCBC Bank</p>
      <p>said in a note. “It is almost inevitable that the bill will</p>
      <p>become law within the next 10 days. There are no detailed</p>
      <p>retaliation plans from Chinese side yet.”</p>
      <p>Prior to market opening on Friday, the People’s Bank of</p>
      <p>China (PBOC) set its midpoint rate at a fresh</p>
      <p>2-1/2-week low of 7.0306 per dollar, 89 pips or 0.13% weaker</p>
      <p>than the previous fix of 7.0217.</p>
      <p>In the spot market, onshore yuan opened at 7.0266</p>
      <p>per dollar and was changing hands at 7.0323 at midday, 36 pips</p>
      <p>weaker than the previous late session close.</p>
      <p>If the onshore yuan finishes the late night session at its</p>
      <p>midday level, it would mark the second straight weekly loss for</p>
      <p>the currency.</p>
      <p>Several FX strategists said their forecasts for the yuan’s</p>
      <p>level at the end of the year and into the 2020 will depend on</p>
      <p>whether Washington adds fresh tariffs on Chinese goods on Dec.</p>
      <p>15, as originally threatened.</p>
      <p>Such concerns were also reflected in options market trading.</p>
      <p>The one-month contract of the implied volatility,</p>
      <p>which gauges investors’ expectations for swings in the dollar</p>
      <p>against the yuan in a month’s time, rose to the highest level</p>
      <p>since Oct. 11.</p>
      <p>China has invited top U.S. trade negotiators for a new round</p>
      <p>of face-to-face talks in Beijing amid continued efforts to</p>
      <p>strike at least a limited deal, the Wall Street Journal reported</p>
      <p>on Thursday citing unnamed sources.</p>
      <p>The global dollar index fell to 97.958 at midday from</p>
      <p>the previous close of 97.993.</p>
      <p>The offshore yuan was trading at 7.0334 per dollar</p>
      <p>as of midday.</p>
