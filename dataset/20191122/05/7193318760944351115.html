      <p>Cloud migration is the process of moving data, applications and other business elements to a cloud computing environment. There are various types of cloud migrations a business can perform; one common model for most small businesses is the transfer of data and applications from a local, on-premise data center to the public cloud.</p>
      <p>Companies move to the cloud for a number a reasons, including cost effectiveness, simplification of IT systems, scalability, and security. And while migration to the cloud can bring tremendous benefits to your business, there are also some challenges. Here are five things to keep in mind as you migrate your business to the cloud.</p>
      <p><b>1.</b> <b>Establish a Baseline</b></p>
      <p>As with any big change, the first step is to know what you’re already doing. Make sure you have a firm understanding of all your current business operations and the types of systems already in play. Before you make a change, you need to know what for the base for your current business “as is.” Once you have a good idea of how your day-to-day operations intersect with your technology, you an analyze specific areas where moving to the cloud could better support your business and improve on what you’re already doing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Evaluate All Options and Look Closely at Security</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are lots of options when it comes to moving to the cloud, and you need to feel confident you’re making the best choice for your business. One tip: it’s not just about the price. You need to evaluate a managed cloud provider’s experience, especially if you’re a small business or startup that plans to grow. The extra up-front investment will be worth it in the long run if it means you’re working with a partner who has experience with scalable solutions.</p>
      <p>In addition, experts predict that 2020 will continue to see an increased focus from cyber attackers on infiltrating the cloud. Beyond the toll on your time and the expense of downtime, a data breach can be damaging to your brand and your customer relationships. When you’re looking ab business cloud solutions, it’s a good practice to be exacting in terms of your security requirements, and how you expect a potential partner to safeguard your data.</p>
      <p>To that end, your partnership with a cloud host is only as good as the service level agreements (SLAs) you’ve put in place. When you look at your contract, make sure you pay special attention to the SLAs and the ways in which those reflect the level of service and support you expect to receive from your vendor.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Manage Identities</b>
      </p>
      <p>While cloud migration promises a lot in terms of increased scalability and flexibility, the specifics of “who has access to what, and when” can be tricky. Identity and access management relates to how you deal with onboard, offboarding, and everything in between. While it can be complicated to create a comprehensive access list, the alternative could be new employees who utilize the the tools they need to get work done, or former employees who can still get into company data.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Enable Remote Working</b>
      </p>
      <p>More and more, the workplace is shifting to enable employees to work wherever and whenever they choose. As remote works becomes acceptable and commonplace, businesses are expected to keep up. As you migrate to the cloud, it’s important to consider how you can enable your team to work efficiently and effectively, even if they are not in the office.</p>
      <p>Using web-based project management tools (such as Asana or Basecamp) puts everything in one place, to make sure your employees have what they need no matter where they are. Moving key data and documents to the cloud ensures they’ll be able to get things done from anywhere.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. Plan for Worst-Case Scenarios</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the biggest benefits of moving to the cloud is the increased resilience you’ll have in the event of a business calamity. Because your data isn’t stored exclusively on-site, you’ll still have access to it even if your physical location is inaccessible. Keep in mind disasters don’t have to be a physical misfortune, such as a fire or tornado. Things like data breeches or a network virus can cause costly havoc as well; having your technology infrastructure in the cloud can help keep your business operating as usual while things get back to normal.</p>
      <p>Cloud migration can take some work, but it can also pay big dividends. As you begin to assess the migration process, remember to evaluate what you’re already doing and document your business process; carefully consider your vendors and focus on SLAs; and make a network and data security a priority.</p>
