      <p>The man who strangled <a href="https://nypost.com/search/Grace+Millane/">British backpacker Grace Millane</a> in what his defense attorney said was a case of “rough sex” taken too far was found guilty of her murder on Friday, a report said.</p>
      <p>The killer, who was not identified, was unanimously convicted by a jury of five men and seven women after the three-week trial in Auckland, New Zealand, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/22/grace-millane-murder-trial-guilty-new-zealand-man-british-backpacker">the Guardian reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors alleged during the trial that 21-year-old Millane, from Essex, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/grisly-details-emerge-in-case-of-slain-backpacker-grace-millane/">met her killer on Tinder on Dec. 1, 2018</a> while she was on an around-the-world backpacking trip, according to the report.</p>
      <p>The two spent hours drinking cocktails then went back to his hotel room, where he strangled her to death during consensual sex, prosecutors alleged.</p>
      <p>He then shoved her body into a suitcase and dumped it into the woods, according to prosecutors. She was found by rangers in a mountain region weeks later,<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-50512163"> the BBC reported.</a></p>
      <p>The killer argued in his defense that she was killed during rough sex, but a forensic pathologist said it would have taken up to 10 minutes for him to strangle her to death.</p>
      <p>“You can’t consent to your own murder,” one of the prosecutors said during the trial, according to the Guardian.</p>
      <p>“This isn’t a little bit of sex gone wrong,” he added.</p>
      <p>Defense attorneys argued that he disposed of her body because he feared he couldn’t explain how she died during the sex romp.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors blew holes in that theory when they revealed he “sexualized” the killing by searching for pornography and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/grace-millanes-accused-killer-took-trophy-photos-of-her-naked-body-prosecutors/">taking photos of her dead body</a>, the BBC reported.</p>
      <p>Millane’s parents sobbed in the courtroom as her killer was convicted. He’s scheduled to be sentenced in February.</p>
