      <h2>Arsenal defender Rob Holding says he is not worried by Jose Mourinho taking over at Tottenham Hotspur</h2>

      <h3>Arsenal defender Rob Holding has insisted that he is not worried about Jose Mourinho’s appointment as Tottenham’s new manager.</h3>
      <p>The Portuguese coach has been brought in as Mauricio Pochettino’s successor at the north London club after Spurs opted to part company with the Argentine on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was swiftly confirmed as the club’s new manager on Wednesday morning and the Portuguese coach will now turn his attentions towards preparing his team for their trip to West Ham United on Saturday lunchtime.</p>
      <p>Spurs have made a stuttering start to the new season and they currently find themselves down in 14th place in the Premier League table after having won just three of their opening 12 games.</p>
      <p>Arsenal defender Holding insists that he is not concerned about Mourinho’s appointment.</p>
      <p>Asked if Mourinho’s appointment concerns him, Holding told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11670/11865746/arsenal-not-at-crisis-point-says-rob-holding">Sky Sports</a>: “Not one bit. My focus is on Arsenal and that’s all we need to worry about.”</p>
      <p>The defender did admit that he was somewhat surprised by Tottenham’s decision to part company with Pochettino.</p>
      <p>He continued: “When I heard they’d sacked Pochettino I was shocked, but I’m not involved in that.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t affect me and it doesn’t affect Arsenal and what we need to do. We just need to concentrate on ourselves.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never spoken to [Pochettino] personally but obviously Tottenham are big rivals for us, he had them playing well and he got them to the Champions League final last year. They had a good spell under him, but football moves on quickly and things change.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal will return to Premier League action on Saturday afternoon when they take on Southampton at The Emirates.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are currently in sixth place and eight points adrift of the top four.</p>
