      <p>The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure is working with a new contractor in the South Okanagan this year, and they're gearing up to deal with winter conditions when the weather turns. </p>
      <p>Jeff Wiseman, MoTI operations manager, told the Regional District of Okanagan Similkameen board that AIM Roads is busy gathering equipment from around the country, as far away as Quebec. </p>
      <p>"Is it all here yet? Not yet. It’s going to be just in time,” Wiseman said. “We have been very fortunate so far it’s been a normal winter."</p>
      <p>Wiseman told the directors he understands winter can be a difficult time, fielding calls from their constituents complaining about snow accumulation on roads that MoTI maintains.</p>
      <p>"We have a lot of people that are interested in what is and isn’t happening on their roads, and more often it’s what isn’t happening that people are concerned about," he said. </p>
      <p>"But during the winter, there will be snow on the roads and they will be slippery ... you can’t have equipment everywhere all the time, that’s why roads are prioritized.”</p>
      <p>Roads are classified from A to F, with A roads being high-traffic areas like highways and those at ski resorts, and F being roads that are not maintained at all in the winter. </p>
      <p>Class A roads have a cap at four centimetres of snow accumulation before crews are at work.</p>
      <p>Some directors voiced concerns. </p>
      <p>"Residents are getting nervous … they are concerned we’re not ready again. I’m getting calls about that," said Area I Apex/Kaleden director Subrina Monteith, to which Wiseman expressed confidence they would be. </p>
      <p>Bob Coyne of rural Princeton had questions about new contractors AIM Roads and the subcontractors they use, saying he hears from his public that they aren't sure who to turn to for information. </p>
      <p>"If they have questions…who are the subcontractors responsible to? AIM, or to you?" he asked. "People are like, who do they get mad at?”</p>
      <p>Wiseman replied to laughter: "Simple answer to that: Get mad at AIM."</p>
      <p>Penticton mayor John Vassilaki asked about the brine mixture used as an anti-icing measure on roadways. </p>
      <p>"As you know, we have a big deer problem in Penticton," he said, asking whether the salt attracts deer to roadways.</p>
      <p>Wiseman explained that in some areas where bighorn sheep are common, like Olalla, salt licks are placed above the highway to discourage the animals from heading to the road, but he could not speak to deer. </p>
      <p>Overall, Wiseman appeared confident about service this winter, explaining that things like AIM's increased equipment inventory, new MoTI rules that Class A roads must be plowed bare within 24 hours when the pavement is -9 C or warmer and a new AIM Roads call centre located in Penticton should help improve service. </p>
