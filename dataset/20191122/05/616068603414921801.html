      <p>Despite living through one of the most damaging winter storm seasons in 2018, a new BC Hydro report finds many British Columbians remain unprepared for storm-related power outages.</p>
      <p>The report looks at the operational challenges faced by BC Hydro due to an increase in the frequency and severity of weather events in our province.</p>
      <p>In 2018, British Columbians experienced a record number of power outages as a result of adverse weather causing trees and vegetation to come into contact with power lines and transformers.</p>
      <p>Hydro says 30 per cent of outages in the province can be attributed to storm damage.</p>
      <p>One storm in December of 2018 – the largest in BC Hydro history –  caused unprecedented damage and left over 750,000 customers without power. Of those, seven per cent remained without heat and lights for more than 72 hours.</p>
      <p>The study indicates that despite those numbers, a full 60 per cent of British Columbians have not taken steps to be more prepared for storm-related power outages, and more than half do not have an emergency kit.</p>
      <p>With winter right around the corner, you're advised to prepare for storm-related power outages, including  a well-stocked emergency kit with supplies for each member of the household for at least 72 hours. An emergency kit should include basic supplies, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A flashlight and extra batteries</li>
        <li>First aid kit</li>
        <li>Required medications</li>
        <li>Non-perishable food and bottled water</li>
      </ul>
      <p>BC Hydro is also reminding British Columbians that if they come across a down or damaged power line, it should be considered live and dangerous and be reported to 911.</p>
