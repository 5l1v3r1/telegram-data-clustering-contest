      <p>India will become the last major cricketing nation to enter the pink-ball Test era on Friday after initially resisting innovations to the five-day format. The second Test against Bangladesh in Kolkata will be a day-night affair -- partly played under floodlights, and with a pink ball rather than red for better visibility.</p>
      <p>Day-night Tests, aimed at increasing crowds and TV audiences for the five-day games, were successfully introduced in 2015 but India has balked at joining the party.</p>
