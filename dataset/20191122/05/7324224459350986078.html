      <p>Vinnie Jones has said he speaks to his late wife every day as he comes to terms with her death.</p>
      <p>Tanya Jones, the footballer-turned-actor’s wife of 25 years, was 53 when she died in July following a years-long battle with cancer.</p>
      <p>In an interview with The Sun, Jones, who is taking part in The X Factor: Celebrity in order to pay tribute to Tanya, revealed how he copes with her loss.</p>

      <p>He told the newspaper: “I talk to her all of the time. Constantly, every day.</p>
      <p>“We have a little chat when I’m making my bed. This morning I went, ‘There you go babe, look’, and it wasn’t my best bed making, so I re-did it.”</p>
      <p>Tanya died at the family home in July after being diagnosed with melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, in 2013.</p>
      <p>Jones had also been diagnosed with the illness but later got the all-clear.</p>
      <p>Following his wife’s death, Jones has sold their LA home, saying it would be too difficult to live there without Tanya.</p>
      <p>He has now bought the property next door, where 32-year-old Kayley, Tanya’s daughter from a previous relationship, lives.</p>
      <p>Jones, who famously had a reputation as a hard man while playing for  Wimbledon during his football career, also revealed Tanya’s dog had recently died.</p>
      <p>“Tanya’s little dog Gypsy passed away last week,” he said. “Kayley phoned me at 3am to tell me.</p>
      <p>“That dog never left her side. He was about 10. But we take a positive view — he’s with Tanya now. It’s incredible how he died so close to her.”</p>
