      <h3>Scott Pye has been ruled out of Friday’s second practice session at the Coates Hire Newcastle 500 after he was hospitalised due to illness.</h3>
      <p>The 29-year-old was hit with a bout of gastro overnight, but he managed to get through the opening practice session. However, his condition deteriorated following the morning’s 30-minute hitout.</p>
      <p>He was replaced in the #2 Walkinshaw Andretti United ZB Commodore by co-driver Warren Luff for the second practice session, which commenced over three hours after Practice 1 ended.</p>

      <p>Luff was on standby for Friday’s running as Pye suffered with the illness, and took over the #2 duties once Pye was sent to hospital for further checks.</p>
      <p>However, speaking after Practice 1 prior to his hospitalisation, Pye suggested he should be fine to continue for the remainder of the weekend.</p>
      <p>Pye’s hospitalisation means Luff undertook double duties on Friday, in line with his Toyota 86 drive.</p>
