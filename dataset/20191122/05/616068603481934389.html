      <p>Two years ago, a fundraising campaign<a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/208393/a-home-away-from-home"> kicked off</a> with the dream of building a home away from home for out-of-town families of patients at Kelowna General Hospital. Thursday night, that dream officially became a reality, when the the public was welcomed into JoeAnna's House.</p>
      <p>The nearly 14,000-square-foot home can sleep more than 70 people, with 20 hotel-style rooms, along with a large shared kitchen and living space. Anyone from out of town who has a loved one staying at KGH can stay at JoeAnna's House for just $25 per night.</p>
      <p>“It doesn't have to be a child, it could be anybody,” said Darlene Haslock, manager of operations at JoeAnna's House. “We've had a lot of calls from seniors who have a spouse possibly coming into town for back surgery, or heart surgery, and the wife or the husband would like to be close to their spouse obviously.</p>
      <p>“(They're) concerned about the winter roads, driving from Penticton or Nelson or Trail, so if they're here, they're able to walk over, they're able to have a parking spot, which is huge around here, and of course a warm bed and a place to stay each night.”</p>
      <p>JoeAnna's House is named after the late Joe and Anna Huber, the former owners of Kelowna's Prestige Hotel. Joe Jr., their son and now CEO of their hotel chain, wanted to honour his parents' legacy of giving with the much-needed accommodation at KGH, and he partnered with the KGH Foundation to make it happen.</p>
      <p>Over the past two years, more than 4,000 people donated to the campaign, raising more than $10 million, blowing their goal of $8 million out of the water. The KGH foundation will continue to fundraise in perpetuity though, as running JoeAnna's House is expected to cost $500,000 annually.</p>
      <p>About a year ago, JoeAnna's House was just <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/239982/joeannas-house-begins">an empty parking lot</a>, but construction ended up wrapping up two months early, and under budget.</p>
      <p>“We have had trades that have offered services (for free), drywall, all the TVs came in for free, all the beds,” Haslock said. “The generosity from this community has been absolutely amazing.”</p>
      <p>Penticton's Christina Palmer knows all too well about the challenges of travelling for medical procedures as a young family. She describes her four-year-old daughter as “medically complex,” and as such, Christina, her husband Rob and their six-year-old son have spent many holidays and birthdays in hospitals across the province.</p>
      <p>“Being in the hospital adds a huge amount of emotional and financial stress to a family, with barely having enough energy just to survive at times,” Christina said, speaking at the unveiling of JoeAnna's House Thursday. “What truly always matters is having family together.”</p>
      <p>JoeAnna's House will be open to the public Friday from 2-6 p.m., before officially opening to those who need it on Monday.</p>
