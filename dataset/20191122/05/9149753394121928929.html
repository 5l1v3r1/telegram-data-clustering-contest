      <h1>Grab the WD Black 2TB SSD for it's lowest ever price of just £300 right now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:00:14+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>NVMe SSDs are no longer the ultra-premium storage drives they once were, as they have slowly fallen in price over the past year, to the point where some models don't cost much more than comparable SATA drives. In this early <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday PC gaming deals</a>, you can get a 2TB WD Black SSD for <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07M9VXSXG">just £299.99</a>, a savings of £165 from the previous price. This also appears to be the lowest price ever, at least on Amazon.</p>
      <p>This drive from Western Digital is advertised with "speeds up to 3400MB/s." <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/13760/the-western-digital-wd-black-sn750-ssd-review">Real-world testing from ANandTech</a> rated sequential reads at around 3400 MB/s, and sequential writes at 2900 MB/s, making this one of the fastest commercially-available NVMe drives.</p>
      <p>This 2TB comes without the heatsink but the option to add that is in the listing too. And adding an SSD is oen of the easiest ways to boost your PCs performance, getting you boosted speeds in loads and boot times without having to do major work or rebuilding to your rig.</p>
      <p>You can grab this SSD from the link below. Just make sure your PC has a spare NVMe slot before buying—if not, check out the SATA drives in our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/best-ssd-deals-today/">cheap SSD deals</a> roundup and also scour our hub for some cracking sales period deals as we compile the best <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/black-friday-SSD-deals-2019/">Black Friday SSD</a> deals.</p>
