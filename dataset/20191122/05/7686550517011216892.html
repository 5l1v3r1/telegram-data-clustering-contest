      <p>Women from a small village in Devon have been shedding their clothes for their annual charity calender.</p>
      <p>Known as The Whimple Wonders, the collection of women having been baring all in festive surroundings for the past three years.</p>
      <p>The first year saw the group pose for Christmas calendar, the following year, when the snow hit in March 2018, they were inspired to make Christmas cards instead.</p>
      <p>This year’s photo shoot looked a tad less chilly, with the women, whose ages range from 23 to 73, posing in the warmth next to a roaring fire, <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/nude-antics-group-women-quiet-3550684">reports Devon Live.</a></p>

      <p>Among them was Julia Green, 62, who has been involved since the start, and last year was joined by her 19-year-old goddaughter.</p>
      <p>She said: “It’s a solidarity thing and we’re like role models who can set an example.</p>
      <p>“I am confident in my own skin and I think it gives out a huge message in this day and age with image issues, particularly for young people.</p>
      <p>“I was not apprehensive about doing it because I’m quite up for anything. The way it’s done is very professional and sensitive, therefore everybody feels comfortable and there were no issues.</p>
      <p>“People are really positive about what we do and say ‘go for it girls’. What it has done is almost bond the ladies of the village together which is really nice.”</p>
