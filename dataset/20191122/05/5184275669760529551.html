      <p>Actor Gulshan Devaiah, who plays a negative lead in the forthcoming film “<i>Commando 3</i>“, reveals he was approached to play villain in the earlier films of the “<i>Commando</i>” series, too. He added that he picked <i>Commando</i> <i>3</i> because he felt the role was suitable for him.</p>
      <p>“I really liked the concept of <i>‘Commando</i> <i>3</i>‘. Vipul (Shah) sir earlier approached me for ‘Commando’ and <i>‘Commando</i> <i>2</i>‘ as well but I was not able to be a part of those films. But I felt that <i>‘Commando</i> <i>3</i>‘ is a suitable film for me and I am fan of Vidyut (Jammwal). I wanted to do something exciting and out-and-out commercial. They gave me freedom to enact role as per my interpretation. Apart from that, when the film was being shot in London, one had a chance to roam around in London, so it was fun,” Gulshan said</p>

      <p>“Before distancing myself from villainous roles, I wanted to do an out-and-out commercial film because I am tired of playing negative roles in films. Whichever role I have played, people have tagged me as villain. During ‘<i>Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota</i>‘, my character was promoted as psychotic villain, so what can I do about that?” the actor added, while interacting with the media at a special screening of Tamil film “KD”.</p>
      <p>Gulshan has earlier played negative roles in films like<i> “Hate Story”, “Goliyon Ki Raasleela: Ram-Leela” </i>and <i>“Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota”</i>.</p>
      <p><i>“Commando</i> <i>3</i>” stars Vidyut Jamwal, Adah Sharma and Gulshan Devaiah and marks the Bollywood debut of Angira Dhar. The film is a sequel to the 2017 film “<i>Commando 2: The Black Money Trail</i>“. The action thriller is directed by Aditya Datt, and produced by Reliance Entertainment, Motion Picture Capital and Vipul Amrutlal Shah.</p>
      <p>Asked if he feels that the film industry will typecast him in negative roles, Gulshan said: “I am a bit conscious because you have to think about your career. Since the trailer of ‘<i>Commando 3</i>‘ released, I am getting at least three to four calls from filmmakers to play negative characters in their films. I have been doing theatre since I was five. I have done every kind of roles — be it comedy, tragedy or romantic. I feel I am a versatile actor and I have visualised a diverse career path for myself. I want to showcase my talent beyond villain roles. You have to go slowly and steadily, so I have decided I will not play the bad guy for some time. I want to try something else. Let’s see if I get success.”</p>
      <p>“<i>Commando 3</i>” is slated to release on November 29.</p>
