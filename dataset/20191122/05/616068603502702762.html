      <p>The Canadian National Railway dispute has brought with itÂ concerns that it could negatively impact the economy and communities with ties to the railroad.</p>
      <p>On Oct 19, over 3,000 unionized CN workers walked off the job, leaving a ripple effect of issues along the way. It has slowed the shipment of canola oil and chemicals nationwide, and North Okanagan companies are worried they won't be able to ship their products either.</p>
      <p>"Those of us who aren't on the main line are still impacted," said mayor Victor Cumming. He also told MP Mel Arnold that a solution to this dispute needs to happen very quickly.</p>
      <p>The CN Railway tracks run from Kamloops to Lumby, and through Vernon and Coldstream.</p>
