      <p>The eight-series first debuted in France back in October. Gilles Coulier directed the first four episodes with Richard Clark helming episodes five to eight. Julian Murphy and Johnny Capps serve as executive producers for Urban Myth Films.</p>
      <p>“Cinematic, with all the mystery, intrigue and action of the best science fiction, this fresh interpretation is a character drama that considers the myriad fears of today’s world and how potential threats may only be overcome by harnessing our own humanity,” Murphy and Capps said.</p>
      <p>The series is produced by Urban Myth Films, in partnership with CANAL+, Fox Networks Group (FNG) Europe &amp; Africa and AGC Television. The deal with Epix was brokered by CAA on behalf of AGC Television.</p>
