      <p>FANS have continued to flood social media with congratulatory messages following Afro-fusion star, Damini Ogulu, aka Burna Boy’s Grammy nomination.</p>
      <p>News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Burna Boy’s inclusion in the prestigious Grammy nomination list broke the internet when it was announced on Wednesday evening.</p>
      <p>He was nominated in the ‘Best World Music Album’ category for his album ‘African Giant’ which also featured Angelique Kidjo who was nominated in the same category.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the nominations, Burna Boy via his twitter handle @Burnaboy, “African Giant is Grammy Nominated! Its been a crazy day, so Grateful.</p>
      <p>“Special shout-out to everyone on the album from the producers to co-producers to featured Artists to Engineers.</p>
      <p>“I appreciate all your input to making the album. We should all be very proud. #grammys  #GRAMMYNoms.’’</p>
      <p>@IvieAni said: “Burna Boy deserves this Grammy nomination. We saw it coming from miles away. The Grammy still having a World Music category is still questionable though.’’</p>
