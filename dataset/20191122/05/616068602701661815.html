      <p>The British Columbia government has announced changes to the building code that expand options for secondary suites in multi-family buildings.</p>
      <p>The change will give local governments the choice to allow secondary suites in side-by-side multi-family buildings such as duplexes, townhouses and row housing.</p>
      <p>The changes do not apply to apartment-style buildings where units are above or below each other.</p>
      <p>Housing Minister Selina Robinson says the changes will help create more affordable housing, while ensuring buildings in B.C. meet health, safety and energy-efficiency standards.</p>
      <p>Size restrictions for secondary suites are also being removed from the provincial building code, which applies throughout B.C. except for some federal lands and the City of Vancouver.</p>
      <p>The provincial code does not set a minimum size, which means local governments may set their own restrictions for secondary suites.</p>
      <p>David Hutniak, chief executive officer of LandlordBC, says he supports the move because those secondary suites represent about two-thirds of all rental housing.</p>
      <p>"We need more homes, more rental homes, and we're not building tonnes of purpose-built rental, which is really what we would like to see more of," he said.</p>
      <p>It will be up to municipalities to decide whether to embrace the changes and amend zoning and development bylaws to allow the secondary suites.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the province also announced it was changing the building code to allow 12-storey wood buildings, up from the previous limit of six storeys.</p>
      <p>Mass timber construction refers to buildings in which the primary load-bearing structure is made of solid or engineered wood. It has a reduced carbon footprint when the wood is sourced from sustainably managed forests, and these buildings can be one-fifth the weight of comparable concrete structures, the ministry says.</p>
      <p>The province has also introduced new requirements for public-sector buildings as part of its energy step code, a voluntary standard for energy efficiency that local governments and builders can opt in to. Rather than specifying how to construct a building, the energy step code identifies an efficiency target and allows the builder to decide how to meet it.</p>
      <p>There are now energy step code requirements for hospitals, schools, community centres and university classrooms, in part of an effort to make new buildings in B.C. net-zero energy ready by 2032, the province says</p>
      <p>The changes to the B.C. building code are set to apply to building permit applications on or after Dec. 12.</p>
