        <b>Nearly 200 complaints of workplace bullying have been made to the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) over the past four years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A total of 37 have been made so far this year.</p>
      <p>The majority of complaints of workplace bullying are made to employers, but they can also be made to the HSA.</p>
      <p>It considers the matter a health and safety issue, which can be hazardous and dangerous.</p>
      <p>Details released under the Freedom of Information Act show 189 complaints of workplace bullying have been made to the HSA since 2016 - including 41 last year and 37 so far this year.</p>
      <p>Angela Mazzone is from the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre in Dublin City University (DCU).</p>
      <p>She says people who witness this type of behavior also have a key role to play in addressing it.</p>
      <p>"Bullying is a very complex phenomenon, so when addressing this phenomenon we need to target the individuals and the organisation.</p>
      <p>"When we think about workplace bullying, we just focus on the target and on the perpetrator.</p>
      <p>"But actually when bullying happens, there are other people who might witness, for instance, an episode of verbal abuse"</p>
      <p>Separately, there have also been 39 complaints of workplace bullying within the Garda√≠ in the same time frame.</p>
      <p>There were also two reports of workplace sexual harassment last year - both of which were forwarded for investigation.</p>
