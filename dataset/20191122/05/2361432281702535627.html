      <h1>When Does 'Star Wars: The Mandalorian' Take Place?</h1>
      <h2>There’s not a lot of context in the first couple episodes of the first ever live-action “Star Wars” show</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:48:03+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/phil-owen/" target="_blank">Phil Owen</a></address>

        <i>(This post contains a minor spoiler for “Star Wars: The Mandalorian”)</i>
      </p>
      <p>With “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” next month, the age of the numbered “Star Wars” main saga will come to a close, and the films will take a few years off so Lucasfilm can creatively regroup after churning out so many movies so quickly. But with “The Mandalorian” on Disney Plus, Disney is simultaneously ushering in a new era of live-action TV shows based on the biggest IP in the world.</p>
      <p>The new streaming service launched with just a single 39-minute episode of “The Mandalorian,” followed by the second last Friday, as Disney Plus defies the binge-watching trend that Netflix started to go with a week-to-week model. The rest of the eight-episode run will come each Friday through the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The episode itself inspires a lot of questions, because it’s very vague on a lot of details. It just kinda drops viewers into this story of a bounty hunter (Pedro Pascal) — a Mandalorian like Boba Fett and Jango Fett before him — as he gets tangled up with some bad folks and takes on a job that looks like it’s gonna put him in some deep water.</p>

      <p>But I’m not gonna get much into <i>those</i> details, because this post isn’t about those spoiler-type details. What it <i>is</i> about is when “The Mandalorian” takes place in relation to the movies and other pieces of “Star Wars” media. And if you just turn on the show and watch it without reading up on it and all that then you don’t have a lot of clues to work with.</p>
      <p>The answer, by the way, is that “The Mandalorian” is set a few years after “Return of the Jedi.” This is not a secret, as Jon Favreau and co. have said numerous times that it’s set between the Original Trilogy and the new Disney trilogy — which take place 30 years apart. But it’s important to note that it’s much closer to “Return of the Jedi” than it is to “The Force Awakens.”</p>
      <p>Where we are in “The Mandalorian” is just a bit after the “Aftermath” novels, which detailed the collapse of the Empire’s power after the second Death Star was destroyed and the Emperor defeated. The Empire’s collapse is a recent state of affairs in the show, as we see when the Mandalorian’s client (Carl Weathers) tries to pay him with Imperial credits, which the bounty scoffs at because “the Empire’s gone.”</p>

      <p>I should note that the Empire is not <i>completely</i> gone at this point — after the war ended, the Empire still had some territory left, with the remaining leaders choosing to sit back and casually re-build and re-arm before starting another war decades later as the First Order. And we see a few Imperials still shuffling about on the show. But the Empire was still <i>mostly</i> gone, and certainly no longer the government in whatever part of the galaxy the Bounty Hunter’s Guild has set up shop.</p>
      <p>It’s a bit interesting that “The Mandalorian” doesn’t really play up the greater situation in the “Star Wars” galaxy at all given another detail that we’ve gotten during the run-up to the Disney Plus launch: that “The Mandalorian”<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/the-mandalorian-will-explore-the-early-days-of-the-first-order/"> will provide some info about how the Empire made the transition into the First Order</a>. Clearly, the situation that this bounty hunter finds himself in at the end of the episode will lead us into some big-picture worldbuilding. But we’ll see how long it takes to get there.</p>

          <figcaption>The "Star Wars" franchise -- now 40 years young -- is full of secret cameos, soon-to-be-famous actors in small bit parts, and well-known faces behind alien masks and makeup.

          <figcaption><b>John Ratzenberger ("The Empire Strikes Back")<br/></b>Ratzenberger is best remembered as know-it-all postman Cliff Clavin from "Cheers," or maybe his numerous voice roles in Pixar movies. In "The Empire Strikes Back," Ratzenberger is one of the Rebel officers hanging around Echo Base on Hoth with Princess Leia and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels).<cite>Lucasfilm</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Treat Williams ("The Empire Strikes Back") <br/></b>When you're Treat Williams, you can wander onto the set of "The Empire Strikes Back" and find yourself in the movie. Williams reportedly dropped by England's Elstree Studios set, where the movie was being filmed, to visit Carrie Fisher. Apparently one thing led to another, and now Williams plays one of the Rebel troops running around Echo Base on Hoth.<cite>Lucasfilm</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Julian Glover ("The Empire Strikes Back")  <br/></b>Julian Glover's General Veers is probably the most competent officer available to Darth Vader as wanders the galaxy looking for the Rebels and Luke Skywalker. He'd be decidedly less competent as Grand Maester Pycelle on "Game of Thrones," but decidedly more evil as Nazi collaborator Walter Donovan in "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" (you know -- the guy who ages super fast after drinking from the wrong grail).<cite>Lucasfilm</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Tony Cox ("Return of the Jedi")  <br/></b>In an Ewok suit, you'd never know Tony Cox appeared in "Return of the Jedi." He wouldn't really show off his acting chops until later when he was stealing scenes all over comedies like "Bad Santa," where he was Billy Bob Thornton's much-smarter mall-robbing accomplice/Christmas elf, and "Me, Myself and Irene."<cite>Lucasfilm</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Deep Roy ("Return of the Jedi")  <br/></b>It's easiest to remember Deep Roy in the Johnny Depp-starring "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," since Roy played every orange oompa-loompa in that movie. In "Return of the Jedi," he was both an Ewok and the puffy alien band member Droopy McCool in Jabba's Palace. Deep Roy also worked on "The Empire Strikes Back," acting as a stand-in for the muppet Yoda.<cite>Lucasfilm</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Keira Knightley (“The Phantom Menace”)  <br/></b>Knightley wasn’t just any handmaiden in “The Phantom Menace” — she was the handmaiden. Serving as the decoy for the real queen, Knightley was the actress people thought was Amidala for half the movie, before Natalie Portman’s Padmé revealed her true identity.<cite>Lucasfilm</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Peter Serafinowicz ("The Phantom Menace")  <br/></b>Marvel Cinematic Universe fans will recognize Peter Seafinowicz for his turn as untrusting Nova Corps officer Garthan Saal in "Guardians of the Galaxy." He didn't appear in "The Phantom Menace," but provided the gravely, frightening voice of Darth Maul (the rest of whom was played by Ray Park), as well as for a gungan warrior and a battle droid.<cite>Lucasfilm</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Dominic West ("The Phantom Menace")  <br/></b>The prequel trilogy was filled with actors who would go on to do great things, but who were mostly filling small or background roles in the "Star Wars" universe. Dominic West's character in "The Phantom Menace" was an otherwise nondescript member of Queen Amidala's palace guard -- nothing so interesting as his later turn as Jimmy McNulty on HBO's "The Wire."<cite>Lucasfilm</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Sofia Coppola (“The Phantom Menace”)  <br/></b>There really were a mess of these handmaidens. Before she was a full-time director, Sofia Coppola picked up a few small acting gigs, including the handmaiden Saché in “The Phantom Menace.” Just a few years after the 1999 movie, in 2003, Coppola would pick up a Best Director Academy Award nomination for “Lost in Translation.”<cite>Lucasfilm</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Sally Hawkins ("The Phantom Menace") <br/></b>Before she was an Academy Award-nominated actress for her role in "Blue Jasmine," Sally Hawkins was an extra in the giant celebration scene in "The Phantom Menace." She admitted in an interview with Conan O'Brien that she'd never actually seen the movie, despite being in it.<cite>Team Coco/Lucasfilm</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Richard Armitage ("The Phantom Menace")<br/></b>Blink and you'd miss Richard Armitage's small background role (second from the right in the background) among the guards on Naboo. Although, it's tough to recognize him without the lustrous locks Armitage sported in "The Hobbit" as Thorin Oakenshield, or the creepy teeth from his turn as killer Francis Dolarhyde in "Hannibal" Season 3 on NBC.<cite>Lucasfilm</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Rose Byrne (“Attack of the Clones”)  <br/></b>Before she was a mainstay of the “Insidious” movies alongside Patrick Wilson or had joined the “X-Men” franchise as CIA Agent Moira MacTaggert, Rose Byrne was one of the handmaidens serving Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) in the “Star Wars” prequels. Specifically, she was Dormé, who accompanied Padmé to Coruscant to do government things.<cite>Lucasfilm</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Martin Csokas ("Attack of the Clones") <br/></b>The "Star Wars" movies have slipped a few notable actors into the voice roles of aliens. Martin Csokas is one -- he provided the voice of the Geonosian alien Poggle the Lesser in "Attack of the Clones." Fantasy fans probably know him better as the elf Celeborn, husband to Cate Blanchett's Galadriel in "The Lord of the Rings."<br/>For more features and deep dives into the world of "Star Wars" and the culture surrounding it, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.imdb.com/star-wars/">IMDb's "Star Wars" hub</a>.<cite>Lucasfilm</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Joel Edgerton (“Attack of the Clones,” “Revenge of the Sith”)  <br/></b>Luke’s moisture-farming, humorless uncle Owen Lars was young once, but he was never not a guy who stood around a crappy homestead on Tatooine.

          <figcaption><b>Bai Ling ("Revenge of the Sith")  <br/></b>Bai Ling actually doesn't appear in "Revenge of the Sith," but she was supposed to. Her scene as Senator Bana Breemu was cut from the film.

          <figcaption><b>Simon Pegg (“The Force Awakens”)  <br/></b>Another secret cameo, Pegg is covered in alien costume work as the junk dealer Unkar Plutt on Jakku. He’s the guy who gives Rei less than what her salvage is probably worth.<cite>Lucasfilm</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Bill Hader and Ben Schwartz (“The Force Awakens”)  <br/></b>You’d think the last thing a droid like BB-8 would require is a voice, given that he’s a robot and speaks in bleeps and bloops. But to get the sound and personality just right, director J.J. Abrams enlisted comedians Bill Hader (formerly of “SNL”) and Ben Schwartz (well-known for playing Jean-Ralphio on “Parks and Rec”).<cite>Lucasfilm</cite></figcaption>

His scene (which also featured Princes William and Harry) was deleted, unfortunately, but it finds him in an elevator with an incognito Finn, Rose and DJ as they sneak around the First Order ship midway through the movie. Hardy's trooper recognizes Finn and congratulates him on the promotion his uniform suggests, even giving him a supportive smack on the butt.</figcaption>
