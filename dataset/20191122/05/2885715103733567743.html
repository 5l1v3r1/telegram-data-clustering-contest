      <p>Chief Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mamata-banerjee">Mamata Banerjee</a> and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will hold a brief one-on-one meeting on the sidelines of India-Bangladesh cricket test match here on Friday.</p>
      <p>Banerjee told reporters in Murshidabad as well as Kolkata Thursday that there will be a courtesy meeting between Hasina and her at 6 pm at the hotel where she will be staying. “Tomorrow (Friday) Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina will be coming to the city to watch the India-Bangladesh cricket test match. I will meet Hasina twice at Eden Gardens, first in the afternoon and later in the evening during a cultural programme. Besides, there will be a courtesy meeting between us at 6 pm in Taj Bengal,” Banerjee said.</p>
      <p>Union Home Minister Amit Shah is also likely to attend the match.</p>
      <p>Hasina and Banerjee share a very cordial relation and have mutual respect for each other, sources at the Bangladesh Prime Minister’s Office said.</p>
      <p>“The Bangladesh premier will watch the day and night cricket test match between India and Bangladesh in Kolkata on Friday,” the Ministry of External Affairs also confirmed on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The agenda of the meeting, however, was not disclosed neither by the Chief Minister’s Office nor Bangladesh Prime Minister’s Office, even as sources in the state secretariat said issues such as Teesta water sharing might come up.</p>
