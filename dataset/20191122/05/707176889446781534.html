      <h1>Saudi Aramco looks for patriotic IPO support close to home</h1>
      <h2>Local banks, citizens and even the kingdom’s clerics seek stake in national champion</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:00:29+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Anjli Raval</a></address>
      <p>Saudi Aramco rarely advertises locally but in recent weeks the state oil company has commandeered almost every advertising billboard in Saudi Arabia’s big cities.</p>
      <p>“Soon on Tadawul,” the ads read, in a reference to the stock exchange in the capital Riyadh where the oil company plans to list as soon as next month.</p>
      <p>The kingdom had always planned to market some Saudi Aramco shares to local retail investors. But the domestic market is now vital, after a lukewarm foreign reception led the company this week to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a83add8a-09ec-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">abandon its plans </a>to market shares to investors outside of Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours.</p>
      <p>Following the setback, the pared-down local listing has become a high-risk test of the economic programme of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader had initially sought to raise as much as $100bn and to open up the kingdom to foreign investment. Instead, he must rely largely on domestic investors to raise $25bn from the sale of a reduced 1.5 per cent stake in the company.</p>
      <p>Local enthusiasm for the initial public offering is widespread with even religious leaders encouraging citizens to take part. “Participation is <i>halal</i> [permissible] and it is a pillar of the economy in Saudi Arabia,” said Sheikh Saleh al-Mutlaq, a member of the Senior Ulema Council. “Participation in it is a good thing and even clerics will do it.”</p>
      <p>Saudi banks are offering loans with zero interest for up to three months and the company is promising a bonus share for every 10 shares to individuals who hold their listing allocation for a minimum of 180 days.</p>

      <p>For many Saudis, investing in Saudi Aramco is a matter of national pride. The oil company has stood for decades as a symbol of the country’s success, touted as evidence that Saudis, when given a chance, can run a world class business. </p>
      <p>“We should all be very proud. This [IPO] is something really huge. We’ve done so much work,” said a person involved in preparing the listing. “You can’t imagine the amount of sleepless nights and exhaustion and all the young people working on this.”</p>
      <p>The subscription period, which will last until November 28, started on Sunday and banks have made it as easy as possible for their customers to invest at branches or online. “The biggest IPO in history is available, you can subscribe through the app with ease,” reads a message that greets customers when they log in to their bank accounts.</p>
      <p>Many young professionals have taken advantage of the easy process, in what is being described as a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity”. </p>

      <p>“A friend of mine pointed out that the oil business is very harmful to the environment,” said Taghreed al-Madani, a 28-year-old woman working in the culture sector. “But I already bought 50 shares. It is a long-term investment and I could use the money down the road.”</p>
      <p>Some Saudis have been more cautious even if they hope to participate eventually. “We are a bit afraid but we may end up subscribing anyway,” said a private sector employee as he described his deliberations with family and friends. “We will probably wait until next week in the hope of getting more clarity.”</p>
      <p>Mohammed al-Omrani, a branch manager for a local bank in Dammam, said many customers were intimidated by a prospectus document that ran to more than 680 pages.</p>
      <p>“A large section of customers do not have a financial background and their fears were based on what they saw as an opaque process,” he said. “Once we explained it to them they were very eager, especially that financing options are pretty enticing.”</p>
      <p>Saudi owned Al Arabiya media network reported on Thursday that 14bn Saudi riyals ($3.73bn) in retail orders had been received in addition to 73bn riyals from institutional investors, citing the chief executive of a local bank <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/996c56c6-0ba9-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">co-ordinating the sale</a>.</p>

      <p>For Prince Mohammed the IPO is now as much about winning political support as it is about raising funds. Saudi rulers have often used the privatisation of government assets to distribute wealth to citizens through the stock market, and with property prices down, equity ownership is one of the few options for those who want to invest.</p>
      <p>But it has become a high-risk strategy. In private, critics highlight that there has been no domestic debate around the merits of the IPO and questions are now being raised about the implications of relying on local investors, rather than foreign money as initially envisioned.</p>
      <p>As foreign appetite has faded, the kingdom has pressured some wealthy merchant families to invest and if Saudi Aramco equity is widely held across the country after the IPO, any dip in performance could have profound social and economic effects.</p>
      <p>For now though, appetite and optimism is high among middle-class Saudis, even as some, like Mustapha Hussein, an academic counsellor from the Eastern Province, questioned whether they could afford to participate.</p>
      <p>“Aramco is the crown jewel of this country,” he said.</p>
