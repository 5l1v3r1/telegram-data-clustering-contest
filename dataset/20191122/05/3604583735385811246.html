      <p>SUPPORTING refugees, asylum seekers and vulnerable people in the community will be the focus of a garden party to be hosted this weekend.</p>
      <p>Ballarat's House of Welcome will host the second of its two major fundraisers to bolster its work in advocating for and supporting vulnerable people in the community.</p>
      <p>Stemming from visiting detention centres, the group, including convener Carmel Kavanagh, has established a name for itself as a well-known advocacy and support group.</p>
      <p>Without financial support from the government when they leave detention, many refugees and asylum seekers find themselves homeless and without funds to support themselves so it is groups like the House of Welcome which support them.</p>
      <p>Ms Kavanagh said the fundraising was about providing the things that everyday Australians take for granted but other people don't receive when they arrive in the country.</p>
      <p>The group continues to visit and advocate on behalf of those in detention centres but also assists with short term emergency accommodation when people enter communities, with employment and immigration processes, material aid, financial assistance, access to education, medical care and linkage to the community.</p>
      <p>The group does not receive funds to support its work and relies on donations.</p>
      <p>"The money we raise assists people who for whatever reason came to this country by plane or by boat and who are in the community without any financial support from the government," Ms Kavanagh said.</p>
      <p>"So we help to pay utility bills, school fees, rent if they can't get work, transport to get to job interviews, to appointments at the hospital or to open a bank account. Or even just to buy food."</p>

      <p>The Ballarat Regional Multicultural Council supports the event.</p>
      <p>Founder Sundram Sivamalai created it as a place for ethnic communities in the region to gather and celebrate their cultures.</p>
      <p>He said multicultural Ballarat was continuing to grow, while the organisation which was formed with volunteers now has 11 staff and project officers.</p>
      <p>The event will include an afternoon tea, cake and plant stalls and other entertainment.</p>
      <p>Nay Htoo - an Anglican Minister in Ballarat - and his wife Newnew, from Myanmar (Burma) will sing on the day while Susan, from Nepal, will dance.</p>
      <p>The Ballarat U3A celtic band will also perform.</p>
      <p>Cakes and volunteers are still needed to support the event. The garden party will be hosted on Sunday, November 24 at 2pm at 30 Waller Ave, Newington. Entry is $20.</p>
