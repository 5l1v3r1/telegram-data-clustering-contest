      <h1>West Brom v Sheffield Wednesday: Inside track on the Owls</h1>
      <h2>West Brom return to Championship action this weekend against Sheffield Wednesday - get to know the Owls here.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:58:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/luke-hatfield/" target="_blank">Luke Hatfield</a></address>
      <p>We spoke with <b>Alex Miller</b>, Sheffield Wednesday writer at the Sheffield Star, to get a proper look at Garry Monk's side.</p>
      <p>See what he had to say here...</p>
      <h3>How's the season gone so far for Wednesday? They obviously had a very turbulent Summer given the controversy surrounding Steve Bruce's exit.</h3>
      <p>All things considered, the season is going very well.</p>
      <p>After Bruce's impact last season, the sense of optimism throughout the summer was massive and the feeling was that a promotion push was achievable again.</p>

      <p>But Bruce left with less than three weeks to go to the season and Lee Bullen did a great job as caretaker boss, steering the side fairly seamlessly into the Monk era.</p>
      <p>They're just outside the play-offs after a rough couple of weeks leading into the international break and should be happy enough.</p>
      <h3>What have you made of Garry Monk so far? Does he seem like the right appointment?</h3>
      <p>What was clear is that Monk was not the club's first choice.</p>
      <p>He was available throughout the process and Bullen held the reins for six weeks while high-profile advances for Chris Hughton and the Cowley brothers came and went.</p>
      <p>But Monk has done a fine job, making true on his promises to shore up the defence and instil a more competitive mentality in a squad battle-scarred from previous campaigns.</p>
      <p>He has the support of the fans and the feeling is that if he sticks around - something he is yet to do in a five-year management career - he has the potential to build something at Hillsborough.</p>

      <h3>What would you say the expectations are at Hillsborough this season and why?</h3>
      <p>The ambition at Sheffield Wednesday will always be promotion to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>A club of Wednesday's size should not go 19 years without top tier football and there's pressure building every year for the Owls to make the leap.</p>
      <p>And for all the transfer embargoes, managerial departures and EFL charges, the feeling is that a play-off place is well within reach - notwithstanding the potential points deduction hanging over the club.</p>
      <h3>Who are the big threats in Wednesday's ranks?</h3>
      <p>Wednesday haven't exactly been devastating going forward this season, but in Steven Fletcher they have a forward who knows his way around the division better than most.</p>
      <p>He's gone six without a goal now but has hit the woodwork in the last three - it feels like a goal is all he needs to get going again.</p>
      <p>Barry Bannan is well-known throughout the league and has a Premier League delivery on his day, and left-winger Kadeem Harris has torn teams apart this season with his pace.</p>

      <h3>Are there any injury issues going on at the moment with the Owls?</h3>
      <p>Skipper Tom Lees returned from a ten-week spell on the sidelines just before the international break, replacing Julian Borner, who missed out with a virus.</p>
      <p>Massimo Luongo, a real bright spark in the middle of midfield, could miss out with what was initially believed to be a minor ankle knock almost a month ago.</p>
      <p>Aside from that - and as far as we know - the first team squad is in a clean bill of health.</p>
      <h3>What's your predicted XI?</h3>
      <p>Monk has chopped and changed a few times this season and a lot depends on Luongo's fitness.</p>
      <p>I'll plump he goes for a 4-5-1 formation with Westwood in goal, Palmer, Borner, Iorfa and Fox at the back, Hutchinson, Bannan and Lee in a midfielder three with Harris and Reach supporting Fletcher.</p>
      <h3>What have you made of West Brom from afar? Do you think they have what it takes to gain promotion to the Premier League?</h3>
      <p>West Brom lost goals over the summer and in all honesty it's been a surprise to see how well they've shaken that off.</p>

      <p>No team really looks like running away with it this season but it seems like it will be the Baggies and Leeds that battle it out for the title - why not?</p>
      <h3>Your match prediction?</h3>
      <p>Wednesday have had their hiccups on the road this season and West Brom is about as tough as they could have got after the international break.</p>
      <p>A draw would be a good result, you feel and with that in mind I'll go for a 0-0 thriller.</p>
