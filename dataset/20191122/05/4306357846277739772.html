      <h2>Rob Holding is confident that Arsenal can turn around their stuttering form in the coming weeks</h2>

      <h3>Rob Holding has insisted that Arsenal can turn their stuttering form around as they look to try and get their top-four bid back on track.</h3>
      <p>The Gunners have struggled to find consistent form in the Premier League so far this season and they have only won four of their opening 12 games in the top flight.</p>
      <p>Arsenal suffered a 2-0 loss to Leicester City at the King Power Stadium last time out to leave them down in sixth place in the Premier League table and eight points adrift of the top four.</p>
      <p>The north London side will aim to put things right when they host Southampton in the Premier League at The Emirates on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Arsenal’s stuttering form has inevitably placed pressure on Gunners boss Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>However, Gunners defender Holding is confident that the north London side can bounce back and put things right in the coming weeks and months.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11670/11865746/arsenal-not-at-crisis-point-says-rob-holding">Sky Sports</a>, Holding said: “We just need to string a couple of wins together and I think that will lift the confidence again and hopefully set us off on a run.</p>
      <p>“We just need to stay calm and stay positive. We’re sixth, we’re not a million miles off it.</p>
      <p>“We’re going into a busy Christmas period now where there’s going to be three Premier League games a week.</p>
      <p>“We’re eight points off the top four but if we have three wins in a week we’re back up within touching distance so it’s not crisis point by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
      <p>“We need to keep calm, keep positive and keep working on what we need to improve on.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal are aiming to try and break back into the top four this season after they finished in fifth place in the Premier League table under Emery last term.</p>
      <p>The Gunners reached the Europa League final last season but ended up losing to Chelsea FC.</p>
