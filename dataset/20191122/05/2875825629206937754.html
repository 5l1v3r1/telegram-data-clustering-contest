      <p>Ant and Dec have admitted that the current crop of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> campmates are among the smelliest they have had in the jungle.</p>
      <p>Show hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly were speaking on I'm A Celebrity spin-off show Extra Camp with former campmates Emily Atack, Joel Dommett and Adam Thomas.</p>
      <p>The Geordie duo revealed that with a gas stove replacing the real fire in the camp, there was no disguising the smell of body odour that was the backdrop to the camp.</p>
      <p>Ant, 44, started off by saying that it wasn't so bad this year before changing his mind after listening to comedian Joel Dommett having his say.</p>

      <p>Ant said: "The difference this year is that we have the gas stoves in there, no smoke. They don’t stink as much."</p>
      <p>Joel interjected: "They smell of B.O. instead because they are all smelling themselves and they stink but you don’t normally smell yourself because you have the fire on the whole time."</p>
      <p>Ant agreed with this and went on to say that a Bushtucker Trial with Roman Kemp and Adele Roberts was particularly notable for the campmates odour.</p>
      <p>He revealed: “At the trial with Roman and Adele, whoo, I am not saying what one but one of them honked."</p>
      <p>Dec then chimed in, saying: “One of them has got the nickname cheese fruit."</p>
      <p>While a cheese fruit is not something that many in the UK get to smell, reports online suggest that the taste is like "rotten cheese."</p>

      <p>It changes as the fruit ripens, going from a almost palatable "spicy and grassy, with hints of horseradish and parmesan," to its ripened state, when it takes on the taste of "sharp cheese, lemon and vomit."</p>
      <p>After discussing the smell in camp, talk turned to the new arrivals, actors Andy Whyment and Cliff Parisi.</p>
      <p>Ant caught his TV partner out by referencing that he took time away from the spotlight to get sober, leaving Dec momentarily speechless.</p>

      <p>The Extra Camp hosts were discussing with Ant and Dec what impact the new arrivals will have and Emily suggested that <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> star Andy was "like all of my mates."</p>
      <p>She went on to suggest that she would "like to have a pint with him," to which Ant quickly replied in: 'Or a coke!'</p>
      <p>Dec was halted mid-sentence at Ant's canny nod to his drink driving arrest and the stint in rehab that followed.</p>
      <p>After laughing at Ant's comment, Dec was able to regather his thoughts and carry on with his thread.</p>
