      <p>SYDNEY, Nov 22 — A jury in New Zealand convicted a 27-year old man today of murdering a British woman backpacker, media reported, ending a case that has shocked the Pacific nation.</p>
      <p>Grace Millane, 22, who was travelling after finishing university, went missing in Auckland on December 1 last year. Police found her body on December 9 in bushland just a few metres from a scenic drive in Auckland’s Waitakere Ranges.</p>
      <p>The man, whose name has been suppressed by the court, met Millane on the evening of December 1 through dating app Tinder, the jury heard. He pleaded not guilty to murder, arguing she died accidentally during consensual sex.</p>
      <p>The jury rejected the argument, convicting the man just hours after beginning deliberations, Television New Zealand reported. — Reuters</p>
