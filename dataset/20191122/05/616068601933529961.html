      <p>New ICBC statistics reveal the worst intersections for crashes in the Okanagan.</p>
      <p>The notorious intersection Harvey Avenue And Spall Road in Kelowna saw 107 accidents in 2017, which was not only the most in Kelowna, but the entire Southern Interior.</p>
      <p>Of the 107 accidents there, 40 resulted in casualties, which is defined as either involving a personal injury or death. The remaining 67 were classified as personal property damages with no injuries or fatalities.</p>
      <p>ICBC released data from 2013 to 2017, and not surprisingly Harvey and Spall topped the list in all five years – but it has seen a decrease for the first time.</p>
      <p>The intersection saw 95 crashes in 2013, 101 in 2014, 114 in 2015, 141 in 2016 and 107 in 2017 - that’s 34 fewer incidents in one calendar year.</p>
      <p>Kelowna's Benvoulin and Springfield intersection, along with Dilworth and Harvey weren’t too far behind, with 96 and 90 crashes, respectively.</p>
      <p>West Kelowna’s Westlake Road And Highway 97 saw 58 crashes in 2017, while Boucherie Road and Highway 97 had just two fewer with 56 accidents.</p>
      <p>Penticton saw a lot fewer crashes, but Channel Parkway and Fairview Road had the most in that city, with 28. Just under 40% of the crashes recorded resulted in a casualty.</p>
      <p>Vernon’s 27th Street and 48th Avenue saw 47 incidents, the most in the North Okanagan, with 17 of those resulting in casualties.</p>
      <p>The most dangerous section in the Okanagan looks to be the Benvoulin and Springfield Intersection in Kelowna, where 44% of crashes resulted in a casualty.</p>
