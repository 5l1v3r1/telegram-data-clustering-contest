        <figcaption>The Daily Mail brands the plans a "tax robbery". It says Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's "Marxist" manifesto "declares war on marriage, inheritance and business" and would result in a "crippling cost" for families. Experts warn tax rises would not be enough to fund the plans, it reports.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>In a similar vein, the Daily Express tells readers that Labour's plans amount to a "crippling tax raid on households". It is one of several papers to include a warning from the Institute for Fiscal studies that the plan to pay for spending by raising taxes for the well-off is "simply not credible".</figcaption>

        <figcaption>But Daily Mirror readers are told the Labour Party is "on your side". The paper says the proposals will "rebuild a country ravaged by nine years of crippling Tory austerity". It also reports that theatre producer John Gore has given £1m to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's campaign.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Financial Times reports that Labour's plans to raise taxes and "unleash a huge public spending drive" are "sparking fears across corporate Britain" about state intervention. One fund manager tells the paper that "the UK investment landscape will be time-warped back to the dark days of the 1970s" under the plans.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Times reports that spending as a proportion of the economy would rise to 45.1% by 2024 - a level "briefly topped" during the post-war recessions. "Mr Corbyn's plan by contrast is to increase the size of the state as a deliberate and sustained policy," it says.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The i newspaper describes the plans in Labour's manifesto as an "unprecedented public spending spree". It notes that the party has three weeks to "overturn a 10-point gap in the polls".</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Another day, another Duke of York pun on the Metro's front page. The paper says it was "business as usual" for Prince Andrew as he went to visit the Queen ahead of a trip to Bahrain. It features a picture of his ex-wife the Duchess of York - who, it says, visited "to give her support".</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Sun, however, claims Prince Andrew was on his way to tell his private secretary "she was being sacked" and says he "has been forced to cancel" his Bahrain trip. It also reports that Sarah Ferguson "angered Palace staff by laughing as she arrived".</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Telegraph leads on the announcement that the UK will repatriate orphaned British children living in Syria. The paper says it is "unclear if any more Britons will be repatriated", but adds it has been told the government "would be likely to first assess" the cases of three women and their 10 children.</figcaption>

        <b>The launch of Labour's election manifesto is the lead for most of today's papers.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1207686/Labour-Party-manifesto-jeremy-corbyn-tax">The Express</a> headline describes it as an "£80bn raid on your wallets", while, for <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7712805/Labour-party-manifesto-contains-litany-spending-splurges-financed-slew-tax-hikes.html">the Daily Mail</a>, it amounts to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's "£83bn tax robbery".</p>
      <p>The front page of the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/067c164a-0c43-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67">Financial Times</a> print edition reads: "Corbyn's tax and spend manifesto stirs spectre of 1970s for business". Labour's plans are a "recipe for decline", it warns.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/labour-manifesto-policies-full-confirmed-20896520">the Mirror says</a> Mr Corbyn aims to rebuild a country "ravaged" by nine years of Tory austerity.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/jeremy-corbyn-urges-public-to-vote-for-his-manifesto-of-hope-labour-tax-spend-plans">According to the Guardian</a>, with Labour still significantly behind the Tories in the polls, party strategists hope the manifesto "will help to tempt wavering voters".</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/21/labour-manifesto-election-corbyn">Polly Toynbee argues</a> that the manifesto offers a "vision of a country that can begin to put to rights the dilapidation and dysfunction that has been the deliberate policy of the past decade". It "goes right to the heart of longstanding fault lines in how the country is run, and for whom".</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-labours-manifesto-explained/">Politico says</a> that at the last election, the Labour manifesto was a "major turning point in the campaign, with a number of popular policies boosting the party's performance".</p>
      <p><a href="https://inews.co.uk/opinion/editor/labour-manifesto-general-election-2019-voters-initiative-pay-rise-public-sector-1319433">The i newspaper says</a> says there's "plenty to admire". It thinks the measures on employment, for example, "are not rabid socialism but a meaningful contribution to addressing the changing nature of the workplace". <a href="https://inews.co.uk/opinion/labour-manifesto-2019-corbyn-blairite-1319093">Ayesha Hazarika describes it as</a> "full-fat Corbynism" - the political equivalent of Black Friday.</p>

"This election will test to destruction the idea that the UK is ready for 21st Century socialism," it declares.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10397488/prince-andrew-aide-fired-queen/">The Sun leads</a> with a claim that the Duke of York's private secretary, Amanda Thirsk, has been told that she is to lose her job. A friend of Prince Andrew tells the paper there's a "genuine fury because she was the driving force behind the Newsnight interview and the person that arranged for it to be filmed at Buckingham Palace". The paper adds that the duke is to employ her privately in another role.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7712625/Royal-Family-step-force-Prince-Andrew-cancel-junket-Bahrain.html">According to the Daily Mail</a>, Prince Andrew has been forced to pull out of a business trip to Bahrain this weekend after being persuaded by his family it was "not a good idea" following the events of the past week. The paper says he had planned to fly to the Gulf to attend an event connected with his Pitch@Palace initiative. "Does the duke still not get it?" the paper asks.</p>

      <h3>Oxbridge in the news</h3>
      <p>A former Oxford college master has called for the Oxford Union to be shut down, following the manhandling of a blind, black student out of the debating chamber. Mark Damazer - until recently the head of St Peter's College - writes <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/oxford-deserves-a-better-debating-society-than-this-g8r83w8xg">in the Times</a> that the union is "palpably in disgrace".</p>
      <p>He says the episode "exposes the weirdness" of the private club, which charges £170 to join. He suggests the university and colleges should run a debating society for all students and staff, and for free. "The celebs would still turn up, probably in greater numbers," he adds.</p>
      <p>Over at Cambridge University, a 17th Century oil painting has been removed from the dining room of Hughes Hall because it was "putting non-meat-eaters off their food". <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/21/cambridge-university-students-cry-fowl-17th-century-painting/">The Telegraph explains</a> that the painting - The Fowl Market, from the studio of a Flemish artist - features a collection of dead animals bound for the dinner table. The painting will now go on display at the university's Fitzwilliam Museum.</p>
