      <p>Sanju Samson was excluded from India’s T20I squad announced on Thursday for upcoming home series against West Indies starting December 6. Samson took to Twitter on Friday and posted a ‘smiley face’ instead of any text reacting to his exclusion. The 25-year-old did not get to play a single game in the recently-concluded three-T20I series against Bangladesh.</p>

      <p>With <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/virat-kohli/">Virat Kohli</a> coming back to the side, Samson has been excluded. Manish Pandey gets a longer run in the T20I side. The selectors backed Rishabh Pant despite dismal performances in recent past.</p>
      <p>Samson’s fans criticised selectors for not giving him a chance:</p>
