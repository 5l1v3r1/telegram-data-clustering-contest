      <p>New Delhi: Ahead of his trip to India on November 29, the new Sri Lankan President <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Gotabaya-Rajapaksa">Gotabaya Rajapaksa</a> has allowed a Russian Navy ship to visit the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Hambantota-Port">Hambantota Port</a>. India is likely to welcome this decision since it has been concerned over the use of the strategically located port by the Chinese Navy and has been desirous of Russia expanding its presence in the Indo-Pacific region to make it more inclusive.</p>
      <p>India hopes that the new dispensation in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Colombo">Colombo</a> will disallow any foreign military assets and submarines in its territorial waters that are detrimental to India’s interests. Rajapaksa’s elder brother and former president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, had irked India by allowing Chinese submarines to berth in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Sri-Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> twice without informing it. India had raised the matter at the highest level twice in 2014.</p>
      <p>Hambantota Port, built with Chinese loans, is of special interest to India. In December 2017, the Sri Lankan government leased the port to China for a period of 99 years after failing to show commitment to pay loans of billions of dollars.</p>
      <p>During his meeting with President Rajapaksa on Tuesday, India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar had conveyed India’s expectation that the Sri Lankan government would take forward the process of national reconciliation to arrive at a solution that meets the aspirations of the Tamil community for equality, justice, peace and dignity.</p>
      <p>Russian Navy ship Perekop of the Baltic Fleet is docked in Hambantota Port this week. The 138-metre long and 17-metre wide ship has a displacement of 6,900 tonnes and is commanded by Commander Roman Pakhomov. Perekop, whose crew includes 399 naval personnel, is equipped with modern radio-technical and navigational equipment as well as combat armament.</p>
      <p>During the three-day visit, the crew members of the ship will take part in sporting events as well as cultural programmes organised by the Sri Lankan navy.</p>
