      <h1>Esperance council discusses jetty investigation behind closed doors</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Dietsch</a></address>
      <p>Council went behind closed doors to discuss a motion calling for <a href="https://www.esperanceexpress.com.au/story/6495322/motion-to-hear-about-investigation-and-delay-jetty/">a lawyer to investigate decisions surrounding the Esperance Tanker Jetty</a>.</p>
      <p>The motion was going to be debated in public on Tuesday, November 19, but Cr Shelley Payne, who moved the motion, wanted to seek further advice as the motion dealt with legal inquiries and contracts.</p>
      <p>Shire president Ian Mickel initially wanted it discussed openly to show council was 'transparent'. Cr Mickel said council had previously been seen to be "hiding things".</p>
      <p>However, after a private conversation with Cr Payne during a brief adjournment, he agreed to go behind closed doors.</p>
      <p>Cr Mickel said it would be debated publicly on Tuesday, November 26.</p>
      <p>Council is also expected to vote on the matter at that meeting.</p>
      <p>Cr Payne's motion calls for council to engage the law firm, Hotchkin Hanly, to provide legal advice following an investigation into council's decisions to demolish the jetty.</p>
      <p>According to the motion, the investigation examined whether the decision complied with the Heritage Council's request to consider reconstruction of the Jetty.</p>
      <p>"Council resolved that it was not feasible or prudent to reconstruct the jetty whilst at the same time rejecting a study into this feasibility," Cr Payne wrote in her reasoning.</p>
      <p>The investigation also challenges whether the shire had the ability to make decisions on the jetty or whether it was the Port Authority's role.</p>
      <p>Cr Payne wrote that the <a href="https://www.esperanceexpress.com.au/story/6415235/council-awards-68-million-tender-for-jetty-construction/">contract to construct the jetty</a> was awarded to Maritime Constructions "during the Local Government election period", with <a href="https://www.esperanceexpress.com.au/story/6447047/esperance-2019-council-election-results/">five of the seven councillors supporting the decision no longer on council</a>.</p>
      <p>The motion would see chief executive officer Matthew Scott directed to cooperate with the lawyer's investigation and provide documents, including confidential papers, as requested.</p>
      <p>If passed, the motion would have council instruct Mr Scott to take no further action to progress demolition until the legal advice had been received and considered.</p>
      <p>Council will spend up to $30,000 on the lawyer, if the motion succeeds without amendment.</p>
      <p>Cr Payne wrote the investigation should not delay the project as construction was expected to begin no sooner than March, 2020.</p>
      <p>In public question time on the 19<sup>th</sup>, community member Christiane Smith said when Cr Payne <a href="https://www.esperanceexpress.com.au/story/6451411/councillors-sworn-in-as-mickel-and-parker-form-leadership-duo/">ran for deputy president</a> she promised she would bring 'unity' when the new council was sworn in.</p>
      <p>"How is this motion bringing unity to the council and community?," Ms Smith asked.</p>
      <p>"This feels like it's being brought up again and many people are just saying 'what the heck, I thought this was finished'."</p>
      <p>Cr Payne said she was limited in her response because she believed the motion should've been confidential.</p>
      <p>However, she said the motion was about 'due diligence' and 'good governance'.</p>
      <p>The councillor said she wanted the five newly elected members to be fully informed.</p>
      <p>Shire deputy Basil Parker has moved an apparent counter-motion for council to continue to support the current process. Council is also expected to vote on Cr Parker's motion on November 26.</p>
