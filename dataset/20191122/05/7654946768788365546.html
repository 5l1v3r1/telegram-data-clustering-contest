      <p>The 26-year-old man <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/23/suspect-in-fatal-queens-bar-fight-turns-himself-in/">who fatally punched</a> a former Gaelic football player from Ireland outside a Queens bar last Thanksgiving pleaded guilty on Thursday to third-degree assault for the offense, the DA’s office said.</p>
      <p>Steve O’Brien, who also moved from Ireland to Queens, will be sentenced on Jan. 8 for cold cocking John “Danny” McGee, 21,  during an early morning fight outside of The Gaslight in Sunnyside.</p>
      <p>McGee crumpled to the ground from the hit, suffered a cardiac episode and died at the hospital.</p>
      <p>O’Brien initially fled, but turned himself into police the next day and was charged with assault. He initially pleaded not guilty to the assault charge.</p>
      <p>But instead of the possibility of a year in prison if found guilty, he reversed his plea and is expected to face six months in the slammer, <a href="https://pix11.com/2019/11/21/grieving-family-flies-over-from-ireland-packs-queens-court-for-one-punch-death-guilty-plea/">WPIX reported</a>.</p>
      <p>McGee, who was originally from Drumlish, a village in County Longford, had been a popular member of the Father Manning Gaels football club.</p>
