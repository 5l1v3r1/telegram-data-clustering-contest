      <h1>China’s Pres. Xi: Wants to work out phase one trade deal with US, but not afraid of a trade war</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:48:25+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>Further comments are crossing the wires from the Chinese President Xi Jinping, via Reuters, as he now speaks on the US-China trade issue.</p>
      <blockquote>China did not start trade dispute with the US.<br/><br/>Not afraid of a trade war, will not flinch from such a fight.<br/><br/>Wants to work out phase one agreement on trade with the US on basis of mutual respect and equality.<br/><br/>When necessary we will fight back, but we have been working actively to try to not have a trade war.</blockquote>
      <p>Markets pay little attention to Xi’s comments on trade, as most majors remain in a wait-and-see mode, awaiting fresh cues on trade talks.</p>
