        <b>A man has been ordered to pay compensation after drunkenly assaulting a mother and son who had given him a place to stay.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Suffolk Magistrates' Court heard how Philip Harper, 46, of Addington Road, Trimley St Mary, had been living with the mother and her 18-year-old son at their home for around three weeks when the incident happened.</p>
      <p>Harper, a former neighbour of the duo, was living at the address in Manwick Road, Felixstowe, "out of a goodwill gesture" as he needed a place to stay, Wayne Ablett, prosecutor, said.</p>
      <p>The court heard how the mother and son returned home on September 5 to find Harper smelling of alcohol and stumbling around the house, and he became angry for no reason.</p>
      <p>He approached the son and asked, "Do you think you're hard?" before shoving him to the shoulder and throwing a punch at him.</p>
      <p>The son managed to evade the punch and Harper then fell over the kitchen table, magistrates heard.</p>
      <p>The son then ran to his bedroom and Harper grabbed the mother's wrists.</p>
      <p>Harper then went into the son's bedroom, swearing at him as the 18-year-old climbed out of the window to get into the garden.</p>
      <p>He then fled to his neighbour's house for safety, the court heard.</p>
      <p>After Harper was arrested by police, the mother and son went back into the home and found a wooden chair, worth around £20, had been damaged.</p>
      <p>An LG television in the son's bedroom, worth £200, had also been damaged.</p>
      <p>The court heard that Harper appeared to be angry with the son and in his drunken state he grabbed the mother by the wrist to reason with her.</p>
      <p>Harper, who has seven previous convictions, appeared before magistrates on Thursday charged with two counts of assault by beating and two offences of criminal damage.</p>
      <p>He previously pleaded guilty to all charges at the same court on October 29.</p>
      <p>Magistrates ordered Harper to pay the mother and son £50 each in compensation, and £225 for the television and chair.</p>
      <p>He was also handed a 12-month community order and must not attend the Manwick Road home.</p>
      <p>Harper was also ordered to pay a £90 victim surcharge and to complete up to 35 Rehabilitation Activity (RA) days.</p>
