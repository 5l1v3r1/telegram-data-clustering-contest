      <h1>Met police probe Burford Capital sex tape row</h1>
      <h2>People who appeared in video attended interviews in London this week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:00:42+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tabby Kinder</a></address>
      <p>The Metropolitan Police are looking into an incident in which a director at Burford Capital acquired and distributed a sex tape as part of his work for the UK litigation financing firm.</p>
      <p>The two people who appeared in the explicit video — Harry Sargeant III, a Miami oil billionaire, and an anonymous American businesswoman — flew to Britain this week to attend interviews with Met police officers in Stratford, east London, said two people with knowledge of the situation.</p>
      <p>The pair have complained that Daniel Hall, co-head of Burford’s global corporate intelligence, asset tracing enforcement business, shared the private materials without their consent, the people said.</p>
      <p>Mr Hall is a high-powered debt collector who chases assets belonging to wealthy individuals who are late on payments from financial obligations, such as court judgments or arbitration awards.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a0519614-c431-11e9-a8e9-296ca66511c9">acquired the sex tape</a> while attempting to enforce a $28.8m judgment on Mr Sargeant, a former fighter pilot, who supplied jet fuel to the US military during the Iraq War and belongs to the wealthy family behind Sargeant Marine, a large asphalt trading company.</p>
      <p>According to court documents filed in a separate legal battle in the London High Court, Mr Hall was given the video by Mr Sargeant’s brother in exchange for financial records relating to a third party.</p>
      <p>The handover of the material in Miami in October 2016 has sparked a legal battle on both sides of the Atlantic and led to scrutiny of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bf126d7e-ce60-11e9-99a4-b5ded7a7fe3f">Burford’s enforcement division</a>.</p>
      <p>Burford Capital has said the video was “never deployed in any fashion nor distributed externally”, however, it was revealed in court filings in the US that Mr Hall sent the video to colleagues at Burford.</p>
      <p>The legal documents revealed that Mr Hall sent an email in 2016 to three colleagues with an attachment called “HS3 [Harry Sargeant III] couple.jpg”. Mr Hall wrote: “Look what I have . . . Ho ho ho. A ‘viewing’ is probably worth having back in London.”</p>
      <p>Since “revenge porn” laws were introduced in 2015, it has been a criminal offence in England to share intimate or sexual images of another person without their consent with the intention of causing that individual distress. The offence carries a maximum sentence of two years’ imprisonment.</p>
      <p>Mr Hall has denied breaching English law and has previously said that as part of his work recovering assets owed by Mr Sargeant he “lawfully obtained a cache of 168,000 Sargeant emails from his former employer, of which a very small fraction contained salacious material. The video in question was never deployed in any fashion nor distributed externally and steps were taken during subsequent litigation to anonymise the other party involved. The US courts have dismissed a complaint against my conduct and our malicious prosecution claim against Sargeant is set for trial later this year.” </p>
      <p>Burford Capital said: “We have not been contacted about and are not aware of any criminal complaint concerning a police investigation into Dan Hall. Harry Sargeant III has sought to pursue claims in the US in respect of this matter. The US court has twice rejected those claims.</p>
      <p>“If any compliant has been made, it would appear to be an attempt to circumvent the US proceedings in which his claims have twice been unsuccessful.”</p>
      <p>Mr Sargeant declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police did not provide a comment.</p>
      <p>Any additional proceedings in England could heap further pressure on Burford, whose £4bn valuation had made it the biggest stock on the UK’s Aim market until a recent dispute with short-seller Muddy Waters sent its shares plunging. Burford and Mr Hall are also being pursued for up to $91m in the High Court in London by Novoship, a Russian shipping group. Novoship has accused Mr Hall of unlawfully trading confidential documents for the sex tape. Burford and Mr Hall have denied wrongdoing in the case.</p>
