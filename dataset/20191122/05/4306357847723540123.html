      <h1>Harry Redknapp backs Jose Mourinho to bring 30-year-old to Tottenham</h1>
      <h2>Former Spurs manager Harry Redknapp is predicting that Jose Mourinho will lure Gareth Bale to Tottenham Hotspur</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thesportreview.com/topics/football-transfers/" target="_blank">Transfer Agent</a></address>
      <h3>Harry Redknapp believes the Tottenham Hotspur supporters would quickly warm to Jose Mourinho immediately if the Spurs manager is able to re-sign Gareth Bale.</h3>
      <p>The new Tottenham boss has already been <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6501288-exclusive-jose-mourinho-offered-gareth-bale-deal-as-daniel-levy-backs-new-tottenham-boss">linked</a> with a potential swoop to sign the Real Madrid forward in the January transfer window following Mourinho’s appointment on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has been tasked with reviving Tottenham’s fortunes, with the north London side in 14th place in the Premier League table after 12 games this term.</p>
      <p>Bale was regularly linked with a move to Manchester United during Mourinho’s two-and-a-half year stint at the 20-time English champions but a deal failed to materialise.</p>
      <p>The Welsh winger is out of favour at Real Madrid under their current manager Zinedine Zidane despite contributing to their success under the Frenchman since his arrival in 2013.</p>
      <p>Bale upset Real Madrid supporters by <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7706051/Gareth-Bale-flying-flag-laughing-Real-Madrid-infuriated-fans.html">holding a controversial banner</a> after Wales qualified for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Former Spurs boss Redknapp believes the signing of Bale would be a great way for Mourinho to secure the support of Tottenham fans.</p>
      <p>“What a signing he’d be for the club. What a signing,” Redknapp told <i>talkSPORT</i>. “That would get him on side straight away, the fans would love that.</p>
      <p>“That would be an amazing move for him.”</p>
      <p>Bale moved to Real Madrid from Tottenham in a £85.7m deal in the 2013 summer transfer window.</p>
      <p>The Wales international scored 55 times in 203 games in all competitions for Spurs.</p>
      <p>Bale has won the La Liga crown as well as three Champions League titles at Real Madrid.</p>
