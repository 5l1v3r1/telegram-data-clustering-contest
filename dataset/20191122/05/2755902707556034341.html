      <p>A 45 year old Chipinge man stole a 2 500-litre JoJo plastic water tank, painstakingly dug a deep hole in his garden and concealed the loot for the next two years.</p>
      <p>The owner of the stolen tank and the investigation detectives were desperately trying to recover it but their efforts where in vain until a whistle blower tipped them off  that Maxwell Chaita, who stole the tank had hid it underground in his garden.</p>
      <p>Chipinge CID spokesman Detective Assistant <a href="https://www.manicapost.co.zw/cops-dig-up-stolen-water-tank/">Inspector Daniel Mhini confirmed the case</a></p>
      <aside>“On November 15, detectives received information that the suspect was the culprit who stole the JoJo tank and concealed it underground in his field about 50 metres from his homestead,” he said.<br/>“Detectives swiftly reacted to the information and pounced at Chaita’s homestead and demanded a search in his field. Guided by the informative description of the homestead, the detectives examined the environment of the homestead and discovered a spot of red subsoil surrounded by black top soil.<br/>The cops became suspicious and asked for help from nearby villagers who quickly offered to assist,” said the detective</aside>
      <p>After conducting a dig up, they soon discovered the tank at the 15cm mark and they went on to arrest Chaita who confessed to stealing the water tank after interrogation.</p>
      <p>He claimed that he wanted to set it up at his rural home in Birchenough Bridge and that he intended to transport it after 10 years when residents would have all but forgotten about the theft.</p>
