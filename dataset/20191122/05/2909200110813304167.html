      <p>The Board and Management of Student Loan Trust Fund (SLTF) has taken a decision to release the full list of defaulters of the Government of Ghana Student Loan Trust Fund scheme before going to court to retrieve the money, <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a> has learnt.</p>

      <p>MyNewsGH.com is reliably informed the list has more than 20,000 former students on it and their names and pictures will be published one after the other in the Daily Graphic.</p>

        <b>Unemployment</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the persons whose names appeared in the first batch told MyNewsGH since his completion of school in 2011, he has never been in any form of permanent employment. He said he has being engaged as casual labour during EC registration exercises and other NGO data collection jobs so he has been unable to pay the loan.</p>
      <p>According to him, he currently lives “hand-to-mouth, jokingly adding that he is also indebted to MTN Quick loan but they have not published his image anywhere to tarnish his reputation.</p>
      <p>“I can’t even have enough to eat and they keep sending me text messages to worry me. If I get a job, I will pay. I don’t like pressure. I am already under pressure.”</p>

        <b>About the SLTF</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Students Loan Trust Fund gives loans to Ghanaian tertiary students who are pursuing accredited programmes in accredited tertiary institutions. These students must have gained admission to pursue undergraduate programmes only and meet the requirements. <br/>In order to apply you must register at any SSNIT office for a social security number, have a personal e-mail address provide  one guarantor and register for an e-zwich card through which the loan will be paid.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Guarantors and Guarantee</b>
      </p>
      <p>SLTF asks for a guarantor, someone who will back up the loan and assist the Trust Fund to trace the borrower when repayment is due. In the event of death or incapacitation of borrower, guarantor is absolved from loan repayment. Guarantor will be required to pay back any outstanding loan due as a last resort, only when the borrower cannot be traced.</p>
