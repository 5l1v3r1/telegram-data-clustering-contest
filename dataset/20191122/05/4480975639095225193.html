      <h1>EUR/USD locked in tight range, upside looks more appealing – Confluence Detector</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:17:45+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/yohay-elam" target="_blank">Yohay Elam</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">EUR/USD</a> has returned to range after failing to rise above 1.11. Is it set to fall? Not so fast. The charts marginally favor the upside.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">Technical Confluences Indicator</a> is showing that EUR/USD faces resistance at <b>1.1075</b>, which is a cluster of lines including the Simple Moving Average 200-15m, the SMA 50-1h, the SMA 100-1h, the SMA 10-4h, the Bollinger Band 4h-Middle, and the BB one-day Middle.</p>
      <p>Looking down, support is stronger. At <b>1.1047</b>, we find fewer but stronger lines. These include the Fibonacci 23.6% one-week, the SMA 10-1d, the SMA 50-1d, the SMA 200-1h, and the SMA 50-4h. </p>
      <p>Below, euro/dollar has support at <b>1.0966</b>, which is where the Pivot Point one-month Support 1 and the PP 1w-S2. </p>
      <p>Above, the target is <b>1.1179</b>, which is the confluence of the previous monthly high and the SMA 200-one-day. </p>
      <p>Here is how it looks on the tool:</p>

      <h3>Confluence Detector</h3>
      <p>The Confluence Detector finds exciting opportunities using Technical Confluences. The TC is a tool to locate and point out those price levels where there is a <b>congestion of indicators,</b> moving averages, <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci levels</a>, Pivot Points, etc. Knowing where these congestion points are located is very useful for the trader, and can be used as a basis for different strategies.</p>
      <p>This tool assigns a certain amount of “weight” to each indicator, and this “weight” can influence adjacents price levels. These weightings mean that one <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin">price level without any indicator</a> or moving average but under the influence of two “strongly weighted” levels accumulate more resistance than their neighbors. In these cases, the tool signals resistance in apparently empty areas.</p>
