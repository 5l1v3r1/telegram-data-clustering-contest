        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 22 – National Assembly Lands Committee Thursday announced it will be investigating a tussle over a Sh2.8bn land parcel between Kenya Defence Forces (KDF), a group of squatters in Roysambu and Jewel Complex Company.</b>
      </p>
      <p>While appearing before the Committee led by Racheal Nyamai (Kitui South) Jewel Managing Director Boniface Maina told the committee members the firm had paid Sh330mn for the 2-acre piece of land as deposit but when they were processing the documents for the land, KDF and officers from the General Service Unit (GSU) had already occupied it.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>In a petition to the National Assembly’s land committee, Jewel states that they developed an interest in certain parcels of land LR No: 5875 and LR No: 23393 but later discovered that the same land belonged to Kasarani Mall Limited which turned out to be a subsidiary of Uchumi Supermarkets Limited.</p>
      <p>Uchumi accepted the offer by Jewel for purchase of the land at Sh2.8bn subject to the various terms and conditions.</p>
      <p>In a letter dated April 27, 2018 Uchumi placed a condition that the purchaser should be willing to complete the process of extending the lease agreement.</p>
      <p>“We are in the process of completing the extension of lease for the LR No: 23393 unless a reliable assurance is provided that the extension of lease will be completed or a condition given that the purchaser shall complete the process,” reads part of Uchumi’s letter to Jewel.</p>
      <p>The letter signed by Uchumi’s Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Mohamed had also put it a condition that the purchaser (Jewel) must be able to pay 20 per cent deposit in their account and provide proof of its ability to complete the sale.</p>
      <p>However, during subsequent discussions and deliberations it emerged that Uchumi Supermarkets Limited had initiated merger process for the two properties and that a new LR No: 25544 had been issued for the two titles now consolidated and an agreement sale was entered between Kasarani Mall Limited and Jewel Complex Limited on September 20, 2018.</p>
      <p>“Jewel is an interested party in this matter as purchaser of LR No.5875/2 and 23393 as consolidated into LR No: 25544 and any determination of the issue before the committee touching on the aforesaid land will directly impact on its rights to property having committed a substantial amount of money by way of deposit,” Maina said.</p>
      <p>Jewel paid the deposit to Messrs Hamilton Harrison and Mathews Advocates to hold on the same as stakeholders pending completion of the sale.</p>
      <p>The Sh.330mn was financed by Equity Bank.</p>
      <p>Maina further revealed that Jewel had inquired from the Ministry of Lands and Housing why the Military had taken over the land it was buying and had already entered an agreement but were informed that the matter was before parliament.</p>
      <p>Maina who was accompanied by Lawyer Cecil Miller now wants the National Assembly to adopt that the land which they had already paid Sh330mn deposit be declared their property.</p>
      <p>“My plea to this committee is that you stop the KDF from invading to our land because we have already paid the deposit and we are in the process of paying the balance. That land is legally ours,” Maina pleaded.</p>
