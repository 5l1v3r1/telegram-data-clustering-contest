      <h1>Tesla’s first electric truck is here and it costs roughly $50,000 in Canada</h1>
      <h2>According to Musk, a 9mm handgun can't even shoot through its shell</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:25:43+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/brad-bennett" target="_blank">Brad Bennett</a></address>
      <p>At long last Elon Musk and Tesla have revealed a very futuristic looking all-electric pickup truck, the aptly named Cybertruck.</p>
      <p>The truck starts at roughly $50,000 CAD and is slated to be available in either late 2021 or early 2022, depending on the spec you purchase.</p>
      <p>You can currently put a $150 deposit down on the pickup in Canada on <a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck">Tesla’s Cybertruck website. </a></p>
      <h3>Let’s unpack all the news from Tesla’s latest livestream</h3>

      <p>Just like the yet to be released <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/03/15/teslas-model-y-annoncement-canada/">Model Y</a>, Tesla is rolling out the varying trims of the truck in stages. The single motor RWD and the dual-motor AWD trims are set to begin production in late 2021. The high-end tri-motor AWD version is going to start in late 2022.</p>
      <p>The truck is also packing four-inch adaptive air suspension, so it can maintain a level stance even when the back is packed full of gear. To show this off, Musk brought out the company’s newly announced ATV and drove it into the back. The truck adjusted itself to stay level, even with the added weight.</p>
      <p>The air suspension also allows the truck to have a built-in air compressor.</p>
      <h3>Is this the look of the future?</h3>

      <p>Musk has been teasing a very <i>Blade Runner-inspired </i>design for a long time now, but I don’t think anyone expected Tesla’s first electric truck to look like this.</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck features a matte grey stainless steel finish and sharp angles all over the place. Its headlights are even a single strip along the nose of the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Tesla’s website says the metal is made out of ultra-hard 30x cold-rolled stainless steel, and that makes it much tougher than a traditional truck. To demonstrate this the truck’s designer, Franz von Holzhausen, came out and hit the side of the truck with a mallet and it didn’t leave a dent.</p>
      <p>This super-strong exoskeleton should also help protect passengers in a crash. Speaking of passengers, the Cybertruck can seak six people.</p>

      <p>On the inside, the truck features a massive 17-inch touchscreen and a non-traditional steering wheel that looks more like something out of a sports car than a truck.</p>
      <p>Overall, the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/11/26/rivian-r1t-future-electric-pickup-truck-tesla/">Rivian R1T, </a>which is supposed to come to market next year, looks like a more appealing electric truck.</p>
      <h3>How much will it cost you?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Single Motor RWD – $39,000 USD (roughly, $50,980 CAD) – 402 km estimated range</li>
        <li>Dual Motor AWD – $49,900 USD (roughly, $64,052 CAD) – 482 km estimated range</li>
        <li>Tri Motor AWD – $69,900 USD (roughly, $90,196 CAD) – 804 km estimated range</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The full self-driving add-on package in Canada costs $9,200.</p>
      <p>The automaker has yet to release specific Canadian pricing and specs. These numbers are the American values converted to Canadian dollars and kilometres. This means they could change slightly.</p>
      <p>As always, <i>MobileSyrup </i>will update this post with Canadian information when it’s available.</p>
      <h3>How does it stack up against a traditional truck?</h3>

      <p>Musk took no time taking shots at other manufacturers at the event.</p>
      <p>After showing off the steel siding, he had an employee drop a metal weight onto a sheet of glass, and it didn’t break. Then, when they threw the weight at the truck’s actual window, it did break.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>After that, it did a tug of war contest with a Ford F-150. The Cybertruck pulled the gas-powered truck with no problem.</p>
      <p>Musk wasn’t done there. He also showed a video of the truck racing against a Porshe 911 and it seemed to beat the vehicle in a drag race.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Single Motor RWD – 7,500 lbs of towing capacity – 0 to 60 in 6.5 seconds</li>
        <li>Dual Motor AWD – 10,000 lbs towing capacity – 0 to 60 in 4.5 seconds</li>
        <li>Tri Motor AWD – 14,000 lbs of towing capacity – 0 to 60 in 2.9 seconds</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Cybertruck is also packing a few onboard power outlets so you can plug things in and even use power tools.</p>
      <p>When the tailgate is down, users can drag a ramp out of it to make it easy to drive smaller vehicles like ATVs and dirt bikes into the truck’s bed.</p>
