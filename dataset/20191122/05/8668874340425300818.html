      <h1>Tony Brown's rejection of All Blacks role solidifies future with Highlanders</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T05:14:08+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 05:14</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a>’ loss of Tony Brown as a potential coaching candidate has become the Highlanders’ gain.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> assistant coach was considered one of a few frontrunners who were in contention to replace Steve Hansen as All Blacks head coach following New Zealand’s World Cup semi-final exit, alongside the likes of long-term coaching partner Jamie Joseph, Ian Foster, Scott Robertson, Dave Rennie and Warren Gatland.</p>
      <p>His decision to join Joseph in re-committing himself to the Brave Blossoms through to the 2023 World Cup in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/france">France</a> following their maiden appearance in the tournament’s quarter-finals last month, though, has ruled the pair out of the running to become Hansen’s successor, which is good news for the Highlanders.</p>

      <p>The Dunedin-based <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> franchise signed Brown as an assistant coach to Aaron Mauger on a three-year deal in May, but murmurings of the 44-year-old’s potential involvement with the All Blacks sparked concerns that that could have confined his agreement with the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/highlanders">Highlanders</a> to just one season.</p>
      <p>However, his contract extension with Japan means he is fully available to stay with the Highlanders – the club of which he played for 91 times over 10 seasons and coached in various roles between 2014 and 2017 – through until 2022.</p>
      <p>“It is a massive coup for us. Everybody wants him – the All Blacks wanted him and now we have got him for the next three years,” Highlanders chief executive Roger Clark <a href="https://www.odt.co.nz/sport/rugby/highlanders/brown-highlanders-three-seasons">told the <i>Otago Daily Times</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“It’s incredibly exciting for our fans.”</p>

      <p>Clark said the acquisition of Brown, who played in 18 tests for the All Blacks as a first-five between 1999 and 2001, would be a significant boost for the side’s young players given his renowned ability as an attack coach.</p>
      <p>It is in that role where Brown will be utilised during his second coaching stint with the franchise, while he will also be in charge of the team’s game plan.</p>
      <p>His dual roles with Japan and the Highlanders will make his coaching schedule a challenging one over the next three years, but Clark said it would be manageable thanks to the contrasting international rugby and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> calendars.</p>

      <p>The revamped 2020 <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> season will begin in January and conclude in June, while the test rugby windows are in July and November.</p>
      <p>From 2021, when the competition reverts to a round-robin format following as a result of the expulsion of the Sunwolves, Super Rugby will start in mid-February and finish in June.</p>
      <p>After having previously juggled coaching roles with the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/sunwolves">Sunwolves</a> and Japan, Clark told the <i>ODT</i> that he was confident that Brown will be capable of carrying out his duties with both the Highlanders and the Brave Blossoms simultaneously.</p>
