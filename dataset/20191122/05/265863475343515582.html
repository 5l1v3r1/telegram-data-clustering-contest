      <h1>Pete Davidson Says He Treats All His Girlfriends Like A ‘Princess’</h1>

      <p>According to a report from PageSix.com, Pete Davidson has a very special way of keeping his girlfriends happy. The Saturday Night Live star, during an interview in Paper Magazine’s latest issue, stated that he treats every girl he’s dating as if she’s a “princess.”</p>
      <p>The actor/stand-up comedian stated that treating the other person as if they’re special is just what you’re supposed to do. As it was previously reported, Pete has been dating the 18-year-old model, Kaia Gerber, who is the daughter of Rande Gerber and Cindy.</p>
      <p>In New York this past week, the pair were spotted getting cozy and intimate, and she also went to a <i>Saturday Night Live</i> after-party with him over the weekend as well. The comedian added that he has learned a lot over the years in terms of relationships.</p>
      <p>One lesson is that it’s important not to put so much pressure on the other person. The star added that he learned that from his last relationship, and while it hurts to learn it in person at the time, he ultimately became a better person afterward.</p>

      <p>Last year, Davidson broke up with Cazzie David, the daughter of Larry David. And in June of the same year, he proposed to Ariana Grande after they were in a relationship for just a few weeks. Last fall, the pair ended their engagement.</p>
      <p>Following their split, Pete started dating Kate Beckinsale, the <i>Underworld</i> alum. They were seen flirting with each other while at a Golden Globes party, however, they split in April, and he subsequently moved on to Margaret Qualley in August.</p>
      <p>That relationship didn’t last long either, as they reportedly stopped speaking to each other last month. While Pete’s romance with Ariana Grande was definitely the most reported on, his short fling with Kate Beckinsale was the talk of the media tabloids for many months.</p>
      <p>In one interview, Kate explained that she was surprised to see that the public, as well as the media, were so interested in it.</p>
