      <p>"No. 1's where everybody wants to be. You want to be the guy they're chasing."</p>

      <h3>Maple Creek’s Jared Parsonage headed into Friday’s PBR Monster Energy Canadian Finals with a lead.</h3>
      <p>Not much of a lead, mind you, but a lead all the same.</p>
      <p>A handful of riders have a chance to pass him this weekend in Saskatoon and capture a Professional Bull Riders Canadian title, but Parsonage — who led much of the summer and regained it in late October — has the edge, starting with a 32.49-point bump over current runner-up Dakota Buttar.</p>

      <p>Parsonage has shown steady improvement season over season, with his Canadian and world rankings consistently trending higher. A spirited 2019 run culminates this weekend in Saskatoon.</p>
      <p>Friday’s running was still underway at press time; the second and final show goes Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at SaskTel Centre.</p>
      <p>We sat down with Parsonage this week for a five-question Q and A.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: What’s the attraction of bull riding? We know the downside — it’s a pretty painful sport — so why do you do it?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A</b>: It’s the thrill. It’s the sense of accomplishment. It’s the rush. And it’s a pretty neat way to make a living, going to all these cool places all over North America, and the world sometimes, and make a living at it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: You’re a patient guy, and every year you seem to get better. Is that how we’d summarize your trajectory in bull riding?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A</b>: Yeah, I guess you could. My opinion on all athletes, no matter what sport it is: if you are never striving to get better, why are you doing it? Every year, you should try and be better than the year before — keep improving and working to improve, or else you’re kind of defeating the purpose of what you’re doing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: How about the race for the top this weekend? It’s very tight. You have the lead, but you’ll have to work hard to maintain it.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A</b>: It’s going to be exciting. Another Saskatchewan guy, Dakota Buttar, is right there, and the top five are really close. It’s just going to be a riding contest here, and I think it’ll be pretty darned good watching.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: Is it good to be No. 1, or would you rather be chasing No. 1 when you’re coming into a weekend like this?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A</b>: No. 1’s where everybody wants to be. You want to be the guy they’re chasing. That means you’re doing the most winning.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: You’re here in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan … does it mean anything to you that you’re going for the title in your home province?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A</b>: Yeah — growing up in small-town Saskatchewan, we love riding in our home province, in front of our home-province fans. No matter where you are in Saskatchewan, it kind of feels like you’re at home. People are inviting, and they really support it and cheer you on. It’s good, being from Saskatchewan.</p>
