      <p>I'm A Celebrity Extra Camp presenters Emily Atack and Adam Thomas appear to be getting on well.</p>
      <p>The pair, who host the jungle spin-off show, alongside longtime host Joel Dommett, were spotted soaking up the Australian sunshine together as they sipped on rosé and ate food at a rooftop bar in photos taken during their downtime on Friday.</p>
      <p>Married man Adam, 31, appeared engrossed in his conversation with single Emily, 29, as he placed his hand on his colleagues shoulder during their chat.</p>
      <p>The bubbly Inbetweeners star and former soap actor shared a few laughs before finishing their beverages and heading off.</p>
      <p>Emily looked like she was right at home in the heat as she dressed her curves in a satin camouflage printed dress and shaded her eyes with sunglasses.</p>

      <p>Cheeky chappy Adam kept it casual in a vest and shorts.</p>
      <p>It comes after Adam was accused by viewers of being 'inappropriate' with a crew member on-screen.</p>
      <p>The first-time host came under fire for his on-screen 'flirting' with an I'm A Celeb production staff member on Extra Camp.</p>

      <p>The former Emmerdale actor was giving TV watchers a tour of the set of the upcoming Bush Tucker trial named Just Desserts when he was joined on-screen with a crew member named Molly.</p>
      <p>Introducing the behind-the-scenes worker, Adam exclaimed: "I'm here with the one, the only, the beautiful, the gorgeous - sorry what's your name again? - It's Molly! I knew that!"</p>

      <p>He continued: "Molly just told me how nervous she is and I'm really nervous so if we get through this without messing up it's gonna be a miracle. Let's do it! We're a team ok?".</p>
      <p>The Manchester native then caused a stir by asking Molly: "Right, first things first. What's your number?".</p>
      <p>He then blurted out: "Joking!"</p>
      <p>Adam's behaviour did not go unnoticed by fans who called it 'creepy' and 'inappropriate' who took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to hit out at him.</p>
      <p>A viewer watching blogged: "Adam Thomas hitting on the Trial woman and his whole encounter with her was just creepy #ImACelebExtraCamp #ImACeleb."</p>

      <p>"Omg I didnt even know he was married! And he just openly and creepily hit on a woman on live TV! Not okay #extracamp," typed another.</p>
      <p>An uncomfortable TV watched added: "Adam Thomas! Bit inappropriate at the trial thing."</p>
      <p>Some berated him, as they asked: "How’s adam Thomas pure flirting on live tv with his wife and kids sat at home," and "Why was Adam Thomas flirting with a member of @ImACelebrity's production team when he has a wife and child? That's a big no-no."</p>
