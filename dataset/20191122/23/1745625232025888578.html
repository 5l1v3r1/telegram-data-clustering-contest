      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/lindsey-pelas/">Lindsey Pelas</a> shared a new lingerie pic a couple of days ago with her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5Gr_avAcUG/">Instagram</a> fans, and it was all about her lace bodysuit. The ensemble was see-through, which meant that she left little to the imagination in the shot. It hugged all of her curves and featured a low neckline with scalloped edges on top. Her cleavage was on full display. The piece also included a matching choker necklace. The stunner wore a shiny, white robe on top, although it fell down her shoulders.</p>
      <p>The model wore a full face of makeup, which included pink lipstick with dark lip liner, along with foundation. Her lashes were extra-long and popped in the shot. Plus, Lindsey wore her hair down in a middle part with soft waves. She pulled some of her locks in front of her right shoulder, as she pursed her lips and gave a flirty look. She appeared to go without jewelry for the most part, although a ring could be seen on her left hand.</p>
      <p>The bombshell posed against a light gray column, with a bright green couch and colorful artwork on the wall behind her. Plus, there was a bright yellow circle on the right side of the frame, which appeared to be a reflection of a light source.</p>
      <p>It also looked like the model was posing outdoors, thanks to the bright lighting of the shot. She placed her right hand below her belly button, as she sported a light pink manicure. Lindsey placed her left hand on the sides of her thighs.</p>
      <p>Fans poured in with their various messages in the comments section.</p>
      <p>“So darn prettyful, I can’t even talk right,” joked a follower.</p>
      <p>“Forever blessing our timelines in a Major way,” gushed a fan.</p>
      <p>“Lindsey your more beautiful every day,” declared an admirer.</p>
      <p>“Stunning always comes to mind when I see you Lindsey,” wrote a fourth Instagram user.</p>

      <p>And although there were plenty of compliments, there were also a handful of people complaining about her makeup. In particular, many people didn’t seem to like her lip liner.</p>

      <p>In addition, the blond recently shared another update where she rocked a <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5733246/playboy-lindsey-pelas-ripped-jeans/">see-through top</a>. This time, she was spotted posing while sitting down. The top featured sheer fabric and black lace accents. She appeared to be wearing pasties or a bra, as she managed to censor her chest. She paired it with a heavily ripped pair of light denim pants, as she propped up her left leg.</p>
