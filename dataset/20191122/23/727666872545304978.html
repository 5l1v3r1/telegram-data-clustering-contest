      <p>Damon Dash will have to pay up over an angry deposition over a movie he claims has been stolen from him.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>Damon Dash was just smacked with sanctions by a court in New York, over a wild deposition he gave yesterday (November 21st.)</p>
      <p>Dame was at the law firm of Shukat Arrow Hafer Weber &amp; Herbsman, LLP to answer questions over a lawsuit relating to a film "Dear Frank."</p>
      <p>I<a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/film-director-at-war-with-dame-dash-says-mogul-s-comments-cost-him-7-million-UkMhcRxsN0mBUqhds2Z4eQ/">n January, filmmaker Josh Webber and his Muddy Water Pictures accused Dame Dash of hijacking the film "Dear Frank," which stars Claudia Jordan, Brian White, Columbus Short, Lil Durk, and Torrei Hart.</a></p>
      <p>The legal drama between Damon Dash and Josh Webber started after the Roc-A-Fella founder began marketing his own version of "Dear Frank" under the title "The List."</p>
      <p>Webber says Damon was originally backing the production of "Dear Frank," but he was quickly fired in 2018, for showing up to work high and acting erratically on the set.</p>
      <p>During the deposition over the lawsuit, Damon Dash let almost everyone have it.</p>
      <p>So much so, that someone in the office panicked and called 911 during a "melee" between Dash and his rival lawyers.</p>
      <p>No one was arrested because Damon had left the office by the time the cops showed up.</p>
      <p>"The Court hereby issues sanctions against Defendant Damon Anthony Dash in light of Defendant’s repeated disregard of court orders and highly inappropriate conduct," Judge Robert Lehrburger wrote.</p>
      <p>Part of the inappropriate conduct included at least twenty (20) different personal attacks on Plaintiff’s counsel Christopher Brown, in a span of 52 minutes.</p>
      <p>Damon was also chastised for bringing an attorney who wasn't representing him in this particular case, as well as his assistant Nicolette Durham and their dog.</p>
      <p>Damon was also over 30 minutes late for his deposition, while the judge blasted Durham for answering questions for him during the deposition, which is illegal.</p>
      <p>"At no time before November 21, 2019, did the Defendants ever discuss or mention the possible attendance of Attorney Howard, Durham or Dash’s dog," snapped Josh Webber's lawyer Christopher L. Brown.</p>
      <p>The judge is ordering Damon to pay all of the costs and fees incurred by Webber in connection with the November 21, 2019.</p>
      <p>The judge also shot down Dame"s request to amend his countersuit claiming it was untimely, unduly prejudicial, and futile.</p>
