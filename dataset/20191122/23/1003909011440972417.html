      <h1>Braid: Quebec offers surprise olive branch to Alberta</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:26:11+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:26</time> by <a rel="author">Don Braid, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Unexpected relief from post-election funk comes in a column by Quebec Finance Minister Eric Girard, published Friday morning in the Financial Post.</p>
      <p>It is friendly, respectful, conciliatory and supportive of western energy and prosperity. It’s also a welcome repudiation of the hostile rhetoric from Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet.</p>
      <p>The column also contains significant news — Quebec now supports Alberta’s drive to change fiscal stabilization, the federal program that is supposed to pay provinces that suffer major economic loss.</p>
      <p>Alberta officials were delighted but surprised. They immediately called the Quebec premier’s office and confirmed that it’s true.</p>
      <p>Because the feds put a $60 per capita limit on this plan, Alberta received only $251 million after economic losses of $6.9 billion.</p>
      <p>The province is now demanding a further $1 billion for subsequent losses.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/eric-girard-quebec-is-a-partner-of-western-canada-and-wants-it-to-prosper/wcm/85f595be-ccc2-4974-928f-25dad0c2d087">Quebec minister’s column</a> says:</p>
      <p>“This program is not adapted to today’s reality, however, and must be reviewed.</p>
      <p>“For example, transfers from the program have been capped at $60 per capita since 1987.</p>
      <p>“Québec supports Alberta’s proposal that the federal government make the necessary improvements to this program.</p>
      <p>“Indeed, Québec wants Alberta, Saskatchewan, and all Canadian provinces to prosper.”</p>
      <p>Some places Girard’s column does not go; there’s no pull-back on comments about “dirty oil,” for instance. An oil pipeline is not on, and Quebec doesn’t want changes to equalization.</p>
      <p>And it doesn’t mention the severe propane shortage cause by the CN Rail strike, a problem Premier Jason Kenney says would be solved by a pipeline.</p>
      <p>But this column is clearly intended to defuse tensions and ease western anger. It falls back to Quebec’s traditional posture of co-operating with other provinces on issues of common interest.</p>
      <p>“Quebec understands the current difficulties of the energy-producing provinces and wants them to prosper,” Girard says.</p>
      <p>“Our government shares their concerns about the economic challenges they are facing, and the hardships experienced by families living there.”</p>
      <p>Many will suspect those are just fine words.</p>
      <p>But there’s more, including support for Alberta’s opposition to Bill C-69, the stabilization shift and a vow to eliminate Quebec’s need for equalization money over time.</p>
      <p>Just as important is the tacit rejection of Blanchet, who recently said western separatism is inevitable because Canada is not a coherent or relevant country.</p>

      <p>He calls Canada a “petro-state” that Quebec wants no part of. He proposes “green equalization” that would tax Alberta directly and pay Quebec.</p>
      <p>Since his party won 32 federal seats in Quebec, Blanchet has been so noisy and divisive that for many westerners he was becoming the voice of the province.</p>
      <p>No Quebec separatist leader in a long line — from Rene Levesque to Lucien Bouchard, Jacques Parizeau, Gilles Duceppe and beyond — has been so hostile to the rest of Canada.</p>
      <p>Blanchet has further inflamed anger and separatist feeling. That seems to be his whole point.</p>
      <p>The Québec provincial government was making it worse by failing to respond for many weeks.</p>
      <p>There was a dawning worry — absolutely horrible if true — that Coalition Avenir Premier Francois Legault was endorsing Blanchet through silence.</p>
      <p>The letter eliminates that concern. It could also have an impact on how the Trudeau Liberals behave.</p>
      <p>They will be much more inclined to revise <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/alberta-launches-court-challenge-to-federal-bill-c-69/wcm/57632788-e67f-4c4d-a0d2-748aa50120e5">Bill C-69</a>, for instance, with Quebec pushing back in alignment with Alberta, Saskatchewan and other provinces.</p>
      <p>Girard doesn’t back away from Quebec’s unilateral oil pipeline ban, but notes that a proposed liquid natural gas project would link into a 750-kilometre pipeline for Alberta natural gas.</p>

      <p>The minister defends equalization but adds this:</p>
      <p>“The Quebec government intends to continue its efforts to accelerate Quebec’s economic development and create wealth.</p>
      <p>“It is determined to increase the potential of its economy and its fiscal autonomy.</p>
      <p>“Someday, Quebec will no longer receive equalization payments, and this will be a great day for Québec and Canada.”</p>
      <p>The dollars will still keep flowing for a long time, of course. As a small comfort, at least, Girard offers support on fiscal stabilization.</p>
      <p>Whatever else people think of the column, Legault and his minister deserve credit for offering a calming hand across the land.</p>
      <p>On today’s dismal Alberta scene, it almost looks like the Magna Carta.</p>
