        <b>Scott Parker’s Fulham are up to fourth in the Championship table after a 2-1 home win against west London rivals Queens Park Rangers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aboubakar Kamara scored both goals as Fulham won 2-1 at home to west London rivals Queens Park Rangers to move up to fourth in the Championship table.</p>
      <p>Scott Parker’s side had to come from behind at Craven Cottage after Jordan Hugill scored from close range in just the third minute of Friday’s derby clash.</p>
      <p>Tim Ream almost scored an own goal to make it 2-0 to QPR, his attempted clearance coming back off the post, before Kamara headed in Denis Odoi’s cross to equalise.</p>
      <p>Kamara proved a more-than-capable deputy for Fulham’s absent striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, the league’s top scorer, by netting the winner in the 64th minute.</p>
