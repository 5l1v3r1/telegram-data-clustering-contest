      <h1>‘Honey Boy’ Trailer: Shia LaBeouf’s Powerful, Cinematic Therapy Session</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:30:42+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/ben-pearson/" target="_blank">Ben Pearson</a></address>
      <p>At some point over the past few years, you’ve probably rolled your eyes at something <b>Shia LaBeouf</b> has said or done. Whether it was attention-grabbing art projects like <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/see-creepy-video-from-inside-iamsorry-with-shia-labeouf/">#IAMSORRY</a> or the <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/shia-labeouf-movie-marathon/">live-streamed marathon of him watching his own movies</a> that spun out of him <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/in-short-howardcantour-com-shia-labeouf-dissects-the-film-critic/">getting caught plagiarizing artist Daniel Clowes</a>, or the off-screen drunken escapades that were fodder for tabloids, it’s been clear for a long time that LaBeouf was going through some things.</p>
      <p>But his new autobiographical movie, <i><b>Honey Boy</b></i> – while not serving as an excuse for his sometimes-questionable behavior – at least provides some insight into some of the personal demons he’s had to battle in his life. It might even make you see the actor in a whole new light. Check out the latest trailer below.</p>

      <p>LaBeouf wrote the screenplay and plays his own abusive father in the film, which must have been quite a cathartic experience for him. And while he’s rightfully earning high praise for his performance here, I want to make sure that <b>Noah Jupe</b>‘s work doesn’t get lost in the shuffle. He plays a young version of LaBeouf from the <i>Even Stevens</i> era (you may recognize Jupe from <i>A Quiet Place</i>), and he’s tremendous in this movie as a kid who’s forced to grow up much faster than anyone his age should. It’s the best performance of his young career so far – he’s also in this year’s excellent <i>Ford v. Ferrari</i> – and has cemented himself as an actor who could easily become “the next big thing” in the coming years. Underestimate this kid at your own peril.</p>

      <p>Here’s the movie’s official description:</p>
      <blockquote>From a screenplay by Shia LaBeouf, based on his own experiences, award-winning filmmaker Alma Har’el brings to life a young actor’s stormy childhood and early adult years as he struggles to reconcile with his father through cinema and dreams. Fictionalizing his childhood’s ascent to stardom, and subsequent adult crash-landing into rehab and recovery, Har’el casts Noah Jupe and Lucas Hedges as Otis Lort, navigating different stages in a frenetic career. LaBeouf takes on the daring and therapeutic challenge of playing a version of his own father, an ex-rodeo clown and a felon. Artist and musician FKA twigs makes her feature-film debut, playing neighbor and kindred spirit to the younger Otis in their garden-court motel home. Har’el’s feature narrative debut is a one-of-a-kind collaboration between filmmaker and subject, exploring art as therapy and imagination as hope.</blockquote>
      <p><i>Honey Boy</i> is out in limited release right now, and expands to theaters nationwide on <b>December 6, 2019</b>.</p>
