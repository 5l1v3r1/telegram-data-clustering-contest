      <p>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — A new trial date has been set for a woman accused of dressing as a clown and fatally shooting her lover’s wife in Florida in 1990.</p>
      <p>News outlets report that a Palm Beach County circuit judge on Friday scheduled jury selection to begin May 29 for the first-degree murder trial of 56-year-old Sheila Keen-Warren. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.</p>
      <p>The trial had been set to begin in January, but defence attorneys previously told the court that because the case is so old, there’ve been issues with witnesses and evidence.</p>
      <p>Keen-Warren was arrested in 2017 and extradited from Virginia, where she lived with husband Michael Warren.</p>
      <p>Officials say Warren’s then-wife, Marlene Warren, was shot in the face in May 1990 by a clown delivering carnations and balloons. Investigators say new DNA testing led to Keen-Warren’s arrest.</p>
