      <p>Dillon Hamaliuk continued to remind the Seattle Thunderbirds, and their fans, what they lost when he was dealt to the Kelowna Rockets in the summer.</p>
      <p>Hamaliuk, who came to Kelowna in a four-player deal during the WHL bantam draft, scored twice Friday, including the game winner, as the Rockets edged Seattle 3-2 in the Washington city.</p>
      <p>In two games against the T-Birds, both in Seattle, Hamaliuk has scored three times and added an assist.</p>
      <p>He has 11 points 5g, 6a) in the other 20 games.</p>
      <p>Dallon Wilton, who got into just his fifth game of the season, also scored for the Rockets.</p>
      <p>Wilson, who replaced Kyle Crosbie in the ,lineup Friday, opened the scoring 12 minutes in. Seattle goaltender Roddy Ross gave the puck away to Ethan Ernst behind the net.</p>
      <p>Ernst threw it in front, where Wilton was waiting to bang it into the net as Ross tried to dive back in time.</p>
      <p>Hamaliuk hammered home a wrist shot on a power play four minutes later to double the lead.</p>
      <p>But, the T-Birds battled back.</p>
      <p>Former Rocket Connor Bruggen-Cate with his fourth of the year and Payton Mount on a power play scored 32 seconds apart near the midway point of the second to tie it.</p>
      <p>Hamaliuk secured the win when he deflected Liam Kindree's centering pass past Ross.</p>
      <p>Cole Schwebius, also involved in the trade with Hamaliuk, turned away 37 shots to earn the victory.</p>
      <p>The other former T-Bird involved in the deal to Kelowna, Jake Lee, was involved in a late third period fight with rookie Lucas Ciona.</p>
      <p>The Rockets, winners of three in a row, wrap up this brief two-game road swing Saturday in Tri-City.</p>
