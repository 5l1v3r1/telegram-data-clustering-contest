      <p>Now that Marshawn Lynch is retired, he has time to let his hair down and enjoy himself a bit.</p>
      <p>Lynch has put together a number of sports-related community events since calling it quits, and he’s still also managed to remain relevant — participating in some games.</p>
      <p>He recently did just that, playing in a charity soccer game, and raising hell during it, in true Beast Mode fashion. Lynch did it all — getting a red card, and also scoring a goal during the game.</p>

      <p>It’s great to see Lynch is still the same exciting, entertainment guy he’s always been. Always fun to watch him on the field.</p>
