      <p>The Catalan, now in his fourth season at the Etihad, finds himself under pressure following a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/live-commentary/live-commentary-liverpool-vs-man-city_377421.html">3-1 defeat</a> to Liverpool prior to the international break - a result that left City <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">nine points</a> behind <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jurgen-klopp/"><b>Jurgen Klopp</b></a>'s side.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/transfer-talk/news/bayern-lining-up-return-for-guardiola_378849.html">Reports have suggested</a> that Guardiola could be set for a return to Bayern Munich, who <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/bayern-munich/sack-race/news/bayern-munich-sack-niko-kovac-after-frankfurt-humbling_377355.html">sacked</a> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/niko-kovac/"><b>Niko Kovac</b></a> earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the subject of a potential return to Bavaria, Guardiola told <i>Sky Sports News</i>: "When these things appear, is it the media or the club? We don't know. It could be one guy [starting a rumour] and then people take it.</p>
      <p>"I like the people from Bayern a lot. I was incredibly happy there, but they know I'm a guy that respects what I sign.</p>
      <p>"In football, when you are not getting results you can be sacked but in this case if the club [Manchester City] wants me, I want to stay here."</p>

      <p>The Bundesliga champions have confirmed that interim boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/hansi-flick/"><b>Hansi Flick</b></a> will remain in charge until January at least.</p>
