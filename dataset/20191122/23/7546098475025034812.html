      <h1>3 reasons why Altium is a buy at this share price</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:00:41+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/trist/" target="_blank">Tristan Harrison</a></address>
      <p><b>Altium Limited</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Altium+Limited/?ticker=ASX-ALU">(ASX: ALU)</a> is one of the best businesses on the ASX in my opinion.</p>
      <p>But, one of the main things that people say about Altium is that it is too expensive. It’s true, it certainly isn’t cheap at 58x FY19’s earnings.</p>
      <p>However, I think it could still be a buy for these three reasons:</p>
      <h3>Free cash flow</h3>
      <p>In FY19 the company generated US$63.9 million of free cash flow compared to net profit after tax (NPAT) of US$52.9 million. In FY18 it generated free cashflow of US$44.9 million compared to NPAT of US$37.5 million.</p>
      <p>If you value Altium against its free cash flow it doesn’t look quite as expensive, particularly when you value other growth shares against their free cashflow rather than their reported earnings.</p>
      <p>I think this metric always shows how wonderfully profitable Altium is. It’s also building a large cash pile. During FY19 it added almost US$30 million to its cash balance to end at US$80.5 million.</p>
      <h3>Strong growth</h3>
      <p>If one business grows profit by 3% a year and the other grows by 25% a year it’s obvious you’d pay more for the faster growing business.</p>
      <p>Altium grew its NPAT by 41% during FY19, it grew 33% in FY18 and it grew 22% in FY17. Not only is Altium growing quickly but it’s accelerating.</p>
      <p>I’m certainly not expecting growth of 33% or more every year for the next decade, but the company expects to grow revenue to US$500 million by 2025 thanks to the rapid growth of the Internet of Things, so there could be a lot more profit growth to come.</p>
      <h3>Worth paying for quality</h3>
      <p>Australian interest rates have been pushed down by the RBA to a record low of 0.75%. All assets are priced higher when interest rates are low, particularly really good ones.</p>
      <p>In this environment I think Altium is worth its high price, although it would have been better to buy shares earlier in the month when the share price was under $32.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Foolish takeaway</b>
      </p>
      <p>Altium is trading at 40x FY21’s estimated earnings. I think this is just about the most I’d want to pay for Altium shares, but I think it can go on to quite handily beat the market over the next few years.</p>
