      <p>Alberta Energy Minister Sonya Savage said Friday she was encouraged by her first meeting with newly appointed federal Minister of Natural Resources Seamus O’Regan, though she cautioned only time will tell whether the new minister will be able to address Albertans’ concerns with real action.</p>
      <p>O’Regan, appointed to the critical portfolio this week, replaces Amarjeet Sohi, the Edmonton MP who lost his bid for re-election in October. O’Regan made his first official visit to Alberta within 72 hours of being sworn into cabinet.</p>
      <p>Though O’Regan, a Liberal MP from Newfoundland and Labrador, did not speak to media, he issued a statement saying his goal at this time is to “listen and fully understand the challenges faced by this industry, and the impact those challenges are having on workers and their families.”</p>
      <p>The statement said the federal government remains fully committed to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and is also committed to making sure good projects move forward in the right way.</p>
      <p>“I look forward to ongoing conversations about how best to implement our new project review process,” O’Regan said.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters in Calgary, Savage described her initial meeting with her federal counterpart as “very productive.”</p>
      <p>“He listened, he heard, he understood. I was very encouraged with the tone and the direction,” Savage said.</p>

      <p>Savage said she thinks O’Regan understands where Albertans are coming from and fully grasps the level of frustration that exists in the west over things like stalled pipelines and the federal Bill C-69 and Bill C-48.</p>
      <p>She said O’Regan also understands the necessity of a quick conclusion to this week’s CN rail strike, which is preventing 170,000 barrels per day of oil from being moved out of Alberta.</p>
      <p>“I got the impression that it (the rail strike) is top of the agenda for the entire federal government right now. We’ll see if they’re prepared to recall the House early or if they’ll be able to negotiate some sort of agreement between the parties to go back into arbitration, but it is top of mind,” Savage said.</p>
      <p>Savage said the next several months will provide the proof of whether the Trudeau government is truly willing to make changes to address the growing threat of Western alienation. But she said recent comments from Prime Minister Trudeau signalling the government might be willing to take another look at Bill C-69 are encouraging.</p>

      <p>“There’s still a lot of work ahead. But I think what we’ve heard for the first time is that the government is acknowledging that Alberta has concerns … that there are problems with that piece of legislation,” she said. “Because we were not hearing that back in June when they passed it.”</p>
      <p>Gary Mar, president and CEO of the Petroleum Services Association of Canada, said he commends the new minister for coming to Alberta so quickly after assuming his new portfolio.</p>
      <p>“I think it sends a strong signal that there might be some co-operation on issues that could really help the energy sector get back on its feet,” Mar said.</p>
      <p>Mar added last year was a difficult one for the drilling sector, and this year is on track to be even more challenging.</p>
      <p>“Last year, we had layoffs even before the spring breakup … and it’s not going to be 5,000 wells like last year, it’s going to be 4,500 wells drilled in all of Canada in 2020 — a significant decrease, obviously,” he said. “So a very tough time.”</p>
