      <p>Foreign secretary Dominic Raab and Labour MP Andy McDonald had an angry clash in the media room of the BBC Question Time debate when cameras were still rolling.</p>
      <p>The pair were caught scrapping over Islamophobia and anti-semitism during a live TV interview on Sky News.</p>
      <p>What started as a disagreement over <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> deal descended into a heated argument over racism in both parties.</p>
      <p>As cameras prepared to cut away but the pair could be heard continuing their argument in the background – drawing attention to them both.</p>
      <p>Mr McDonald accused the Conservatives of ‘kicking it into the long grass’ over racism in the party.</p>
      <p>The Shadow Transport Secretary said the Tories should be having an independent inquiry into Islamophobia, telling Raab ‘Listen to Baroness Warsi’.</p>

      <p>Ms Warsi, a senior Muslim Tory peer, has repeatedly criticised her own party for failing to get to grips with Islamophobia.</p>
      <p>But Mr Raab hit back, saying: ‘Two parties in this country’s history have been investigated by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission – Labour under Corbyn and the BNP.’</p>
      <p>The heated exchange ended with Mr McDonald jabbing his finger towards the Tory minister, repeating: ‘You should be doing it. You should be doing it.’</p>
      <p>He fumed ‘You should be following Baroness Warsi and you should have your commission.’</p>
      <p>Mr Raab walked off before cameras cut.</p>

      <p>The tense exchange followed a two hour special that saw the four main parties leaders face a grilling from a BBC Question Time audience.</p>
      <p>Both Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson faced questions about racism in their parties during the special debate.</p>
      <p>Corbyn was asked about his failure to intervene at a press conference to protect the Jewish <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> MP Ruth Smeeth from a heckler who was later kicked out of the party.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader said he’d had many discussions with his colleague on the matter since then, adding: ‘Nobody should suffer any abuse in public life or privately’.</p>
      <p>He continued to be grilled on his failure to tackle antisemitism by the same audience member, who asked how he felt about an investigation  by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission into his party’s process for handling antisemitism complaints.</p>

      <p>Corybn said he ‘welcomed the investigation’ and said the party had  ‘placed ourselves completely open’.</p>

      <p>The Labour leader’s record on fighting racism was later defended during Jo Swinson’s ‘car crash’ interview, where she faced criticism for attacking Labour rather than focusing on her own policies.</p>

      <p>An audience member criticised the Lib Dem leader for branding Corbyn anti-Semitic, and told her: ‘Jeremy Corbyn has been fighting racism since before you were born’.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has faced criticism for once again refusing to apolgosie for notorious comments comparing Muslim women to letterboxes.</p>
      <p>He defended his ‘right to speak out’ and said he was making a liberal case for women being able to wear what they want.</p>
