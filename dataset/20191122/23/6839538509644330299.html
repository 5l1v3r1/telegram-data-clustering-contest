      <p>A US woman who killed her twin sister amid reports that she was jealous of her being the “prettier one” has sobbed as her family supported her in court.</p>
      <p>“This hurts me deeply, but I need her to help me cope,” Bianca Medina, 16, pleaded in Camden County Superior Court as her sister Amanda Ramirez was sentenced for killing twin Anna, according to NJ.com.</p>

      <p>The<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/woman-who-killed-twin-sister-sobs-in-court-gets-6-years-behind-bars/"><i> New York Post </i></a>reports that Bianca insisted the 27-year-old twins had an “unbreakable” bond before Amanda stabbed Anna once in the chest after a heavy night drinking in Camden on June 22.</p>
      <p>She told Judge Edward McBride that the family was grieving two losses — one to death and the other in prison, according to the report.</p>
      <p>“You hold my sister’s life in your hands, so please be gentle,” she pleaded during the sentencing, NJ.com said.</p>

      <p>Another sister, Monica Medina, 19, also addressed the court, pointing out the added heartache for the twins’ children, with Amanda having a two-year-old daughter and Anna three kids. “I’m hoping you can see her in a different light,” the older Medina said as she also asked for leniency, according to the report.</p>

      <p>Ramirez’s lawyer, Jordan Zeitz, said it was a desire shared by the whole family, the report said.</p>
      <p>“The sentence you are going to impose is going to pale in comparison to the life sentence she’s already serving,” said Zeitz, who blamed post-partum depression for his client’s out-of-character attack.</p>
      <p>“We would ask that you follow what the family wants – to get her back to them so they can heal quicker.”</p>

      <p>Even prosecutor Peter Gallagher noted the “extraordinary set of circumstances” in the case, the report said.</p>
      <p>“The person who took Anna’s life is the person who by all accounts was closer to her than anyone on this planet,” Mr Gallagher told the court.</p>
      <p>Initial reports suggested that Ramierez was jealous of her twin because she was the “prettier one”.</p>

      <p>Ramirez had pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter in September, claiming she does not remember what sparked the fight that ended with her stabbing her sister in the chest.</p>
      <p>She broke down in tears as she addressed the court before her sentencing, further begging for her family’s forgiveness.</p>

      <p>“I know there’s nothing I can say to justify what I did,” she sobbed.</p>
      <p>“I just want to make it clear that I never had intentions of taking my twin sister’s life. If I could take back what I did I would in a heartbeat.</p>
      <p>“There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think about my twin. And having to live with the fact that she’s no longer alive is devastating,” she said, with tears running down her face.</p>
      <p>“I just want to apologise to my family for putting them through this. I hope that they all can forgive me.”</p>

      <p>Judge McBride told the court he believed the killing was an “aberration” for Ramirez — but also noted she had initially lied to police, saying she found her sister stabbed.</p>
      <p>She later said her sister died as they struggled over a knife the dead woman brought out, the report said.</p>
      <p>His sentence of six years’ prison was higher than the family called for, but at the lower end of the five- to ten-year sentencing range for the second-degree crime.</p>
      <p>Ramirez will have to serve five years and one month before being eligible for parole, NJ.com said.</p>
