      <h1>Bristol ease to bonus point Challenge Cup victory over Brive</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:41:14+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:41</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Bristol secured their second-consecutive bonus-point win as they thrashed European Challenge Cup rivals Brive.</p>
      <p>Having already started their Pool 4 campaign with a resounding victory over Zebre, the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership">Gallagher Premiership</a> side made light work of their French opposition with a 36-0 win at the Stade Amedee-Domenech.</p>
      <p>Toby Fricker, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bristol/players/harry-randall/">Harry Randall</a>, Piers O’Conor, Will Capon and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bristol/players/ed-holmes/">Ed Holmes</a> all ran over a try apiece with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bristol/players/callum-sheedy/">Callum Sheedy</a> converting all-but one of them to seal a convincing result for the Bears.</p>

      <p>Scarlets experienced a much closer-fought battle as they slipped to a last-gasp 17-16 defeat at <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulon">Toulon</a> in Pool 2.</p>
      <p>Toulon have now won their last 10 Challenge Cup games at the Stade Mayol but left it late as Liam Messam’s 88th-minute try secured the points.</p>
      <p>Johnny McNicholl had earlier cancelled out Gervais Cordin’s early try for the hosts and a drop-goal from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/scarlets/players/dan-jones/">Dan Jones</a> had <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/scarlets">Scarlets</a> ahead until Messam’s late heroics.</p>
      <p>Edinburgh and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> Begles had both won their previous respective Pool 3 clashes but could not be separated at Murrayfield as they had to settle for a 16-16 draw.</p>
      <p>Blair Kinghorn’s try gave the hosts the lead but <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/bordeaux/players/semi-radradra/">Semi Radradra</a> ran over in the second half and, with Jaco Van Der Walt and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/bordeaux/players/matthieu-jalibert/">Matthieu Jalibert</a> both kicking three of their four penalties, there was nothing to split the sides.</p>
      <p>Dragons also made it two wins from two with a comfortable victory against Enisei STM in Krasnodar.</p>
      <p>The 49-22 success was enough to seal a bonus point as Arwel Robson’s perfect kicking helped the visitors along.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile in Pool 5, Paul bounced back from an opening-round defeat to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester">Leicester</a> to thrash Calvisano 61-10 as they ran over an impressive nine tries.</p>
