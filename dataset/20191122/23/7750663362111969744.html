      <h1>Jose Mourinho: Tottenham Hotspur selling Harry Kane is "impossible"</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a> has insisted that the idea of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/harry-kane/"><b>Harry Kane</b></a> leaving <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> over the next year is simply "impossible".</h2>

      <p>The 56-year-old was announced as the new Spurs manager on Wednesday following the club's decision to sack <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Kane, who has scored 169 goals for the North London club since the start of the 2014-15 season, has been <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/transfer-talk/news/kane-to-real-madrid-for-gbp45m-plus-bale_374364.html">linked with a move to Real Madrid.</a></p>
      <p>Speaking on the subject of the Spurs striker, Mourinho told the <i>Independent</i>: "I think as managers we must have also this feeling of what is possible, what is not possible. And I think when you try to buy Kane it's just an impossible mission.</p>
      <p>"He's one of the best strikers in the world, no doubt, no doubt. He just needs his team, with him, if his team is England or if his team is Tottenham, he just needs his team to bring him, or to go with him to the next level. And what is the next level? Titles.</p>
      <p>"I think he needs to win, with us, with England, he needs to bring something to highlight the quality that he has as a player. The goals he scores, what he brings to the team. Top striker. And you're right, I've worked with some of the top ones."</p>
      <p>Many pundits such as <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/graeme-souness/"><b>Graeme Souness</b></a> have <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/news/souness-kane-should-join-real-madrid_318050.html">encouraged Kane to seek pastures new</a> due to the club's failure to win any trophies under Pochettino.</p>
