      <p><b>New Delhi: </b>The Congress on Friday launched a scathing attack on the BJP, accusing it of receiving donation from a company accused of buying properties from a Dawood Ibrahim aide.</p>
      <p>Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala cited a media report claiming that the saffron party took a large donation from a firm currently under investigation by the ED for carrying out transactions with and buying properties from the late Iqbal Mirchi, an accused in the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts and a close aide of Dawood.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Surjewala tweeted, “BJP’s donation saga gets murkier — #Electoral Bond Scam to donations from accused of ‘terror funding’! Why did BJP receive crores in donation from a Co. accused of buying properties of Iqbal Mirchi, a Dawood Ibrahim aide? Is this not ‘treason’ Amit Shah?”</p>
      <p>A report on a news website claimed that the BJP took a large sum of money from RKW Developers Ltd, the company which the ED is probing for its alleged connection with Mirchi.</p>
      <p>The report has cited the BJP’s filings with the EC as the source of this information.</p>
      <p>It said the RKW donated Rs 10 crore to the saffron party in 2014-15. The report also said that a company, Sunblink Real Estate, facing the ED charges of buying Mirchi’s properties, is linked via a common directorship to another company, which made Rs 2-crore donation to the BJP.</p>
