      <h3>A northern Saskatchewan RCMP officer has been given a 12-month conditional discharge after pleading guilty to an off-duty assault.</h3>
      <p>Cpl. Luay Toma, 30, <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/rcmp-officer-in-northern-saskatchewan-charged-with-assault">was charged on May 30 with assaulting someone in a home in Wollaston Lake</a> on May 20. The case was proceeding through the northern community’s circuit court but was waived to Saskatoon on Oct. 22, court documents show.</p>
      <p>A publication ban issued during Toma’s first court appearance prevents the reporting of any information that could identify the victim, including details of the assault.</p>
      <p>While on probation, Toma must report to a probation officer in Saskatoon and cannot possess or consume alcohol, cannabis or non-prescribed drugs or be in any place that sells alcohol or cannabis.</p>
      <p>He is also ordered to take any personal counselling or programs for alternatives to violence and anger management as required by his probation officer.</p>
      <p>Toma’s conditional discharge means he will not have a criminal record if he abides by his conditions for 12 months.</p>
      <p>The RCMP officer remains suspended with pay pending the conclusion of an internal code of conduct investigation, RCMP spokesman Rob King confirmed.</p>
      <p>Wollaston Lake is a remote community located approximately 700 kilometres northeast of Prince Albert.</p>
