      <h3>Supercars is in the process of reiterating its social media policy to teams and drivers following a very public Instagram spat between series champion Scott McLaughlin and Scott Pye.</h3>
      <p>McLaughlin has been at the centre of controversy after his team was subject to dual controversies in his Bathurst win, with a team orders scandal and subsequent engine breach casting a pall over the 26-year-old’s Mount Panorama breakthrough last month alongside Alex Premat.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, McLaughlin was caught up in a war of words with Pye after the latter responded to an article via his Instagram story.</p>

      <p>McLaughlin told media on Thursday morning that <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/supercars/scott-mclaughlin-supercars-newcastle-newcastle-500-supercars-news-2019/news-story/a755ae68f79a63f98b2d3c0c8d3666b5">he “can’t control what other people say, what they do, what they judge us on, whatever”</a>. Later, Pye claimed McLaughlin’s championship season will “forever be tainted” before likening the Shell V-Power Racing driver to disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong.</p>
      <p>“Tired of seeing this rubbish. As one of his ‘peers’ I’ve never spoken to Scotty about this or been critical of the team,” said Pye on his Instagram story.</p>
      <p>“But you must understand that some people are going to be pissed off that a car and team that’s been constantly found to be illegal continues to get meaningless penalties.</p>
      <p>“Not saying you wouldn’t have won, clearly doing a great job but who knows. It will forever be tainted.”</p>
      <p>McLaughlin responded: “We were found once of a technical infringement in one qualifying out of 325 times being scrutineered. So now you understand why I believe this is how our title hasn’t been tainted.”</p>
      <p>Pye fired back: “Even if it was once that’s enough to being everything into question. Lance Armstrong (most tested athlete) was caught once, but it ruined his whole career.”</p>

      <p>Earlier in the week, Steven Johnson said on The Driver’s Seat radio show that Pye’s Walkinshaw Andretti United team co-owner Ryan Walkinshaw sent a “cheat” text message to McLaughlin.</p>
      <p>After Friday’s running at the Coates Hire Newcastle 500, Tickford driver Cameron Waters came to McLaughlin’s aid, saying the social media story has crossed the line.</p>
      <p>“For everything that’s happened, it’s not Scotty’s fault,” Waters said.</p>
      <p>“He has nothing to do with any of that. It kind of is what it is, what’s happened.</p>
      <p>“The things that have happened with the engine stuff, it was pretty minute, it’s happened, move on.</p>
      <p>“That’s what’s a bit poor I guess from those guys, saying that kind of s**t.</p>
      <p>“I love banter, but that’s s**t. There’s no more to be said, it shouldn’t be said.”</p>
