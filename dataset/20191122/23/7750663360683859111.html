      <p>Torreira, who joined <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/"><b>Arsenal</b></a> last summer, enjoyed a decent opening campaign at the Emirates but has been reduced to just four Premier League starts so far this term.</p>
      <p>The player's agent <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/transfer-talk/news/agent-torreira-unhappy-with-emery_379658.html">recently confirmed</a> that Torreira was unhappy with Emery's decision to deploy him in a more advanced midfield position.</p>
      <p>When asked about the conflict over Torreira's best role, Emery told <i>Football London</i>: "But what is a defensive midfielder? We need that position for the capacity to build up, it's a big responsibility.</p>
      <p>"He can play as a defensive midfielder but we need a defensive midfielder [to be] offensive because the build up for us is very important. At the moment he is in that process. He can learn and improve but needs time, and at the moment to give him that responsibility as a defensive midfielder but building up and creating a lot of combinations with our team, he needs more time.</p>
      <p>"At the moment for his position on the pitch he's helping us with two midfielders because the pressure he deposits was the best of our midfielders and his capacity to get in the box, to get opportunities to score, is very good for the team."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/transfer-talk/news/milan-napoli-lining-up-january-move-for-torreira_380132.html">Reports have suggested</a> that the Uruguay international, unhappy with his role at Arsenal, will seek a return to Serie A in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Emery finds himself under pressure after only managing to win one of his last six games as Gunners boss.</p>
