      <p>Lille, France:  French police investigating the death of a pregnant woman mauled to death by dogs while walking in the woods have carried out DNA tests on 67 dogs to try identify those that attacked her, investigators said Thursday.</p>
      <p>Elisa Pilarski, 29, was found dead on Saturday in Retz forest about 90 kilometres (55 miles) northeast of Paris.</p>
      <p>A post-mortem showed that she died of bleeding after several dog bites to the upper and lower limbs and the head.</p>
      <p>Her death caused shock in France, sparking intense speculation about what might have happened.</p>
      <p>A deer hunt with hounds was underway in the forest where Pilarski, a dog lover, was walking her own American Staffordshire terrier.</p>
      <p>Frederic Trinh, the public prosecutor leading the investigation into her death, said Thursday that DNA tests had been carried out on 67 dogs -- 62 from the hunting club and five belonging to Pilarski and her partner.</p>
      <p>But France's main hunting federation said that none of the tested hounds bore bite marks, a fact it said proved their innocence.</p>
      <p>Antoine Gallon, the federation's communications director, argued that Pilarski's dog Curtis would have put up a fight if its owner was under attack, leaving marks on its adversaries.</p>
      <p>The time of Pilarksi's death -- between 1 and 1.30 pm -- also put the hounds in the clear, he claimed, saying the hunt only began at 1.30 pm.</p>
      <p>The police have launched an investigation against persons unknown -- a common procedure in France when no suspect has been identified -- for manslaughter due to carelessness or negligence.</p>
      <p>Trinh said that police still had no main line of inquiry.</p>
      <p>He confirmed that Pilarski had phoned her partner, who was at work, before the attack to tell him that she had come across "threatening dogs".</p>
      <p>In a Facebook message she also wrote that a German shepherd was on the prowl but police had yet to identify that dog, Trinh said.</p>
      <p>Pilarski's partner Christophe told France's BFM news channel that when he arrived on the scene around 45 minutes later he came across hunting hounds and a rider.</p>
      <p>He then saw a pack of "around 30" dogs near a ravine where he found her body as well as the couple's own dog, whom he said had been bitten on the head.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Conditioned to kill'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sobbing during the interview, he told BFM that what he initially mistook for a log turned out to be Pilarski's bare stomach.</p>
      <p>She was "entirely undressed" and had been "bitten all over," he said.</p>
      <p>"It can only be the hunt," he said, allegations the hunting associations have vigorously rejected.</p>
      <p>France has more than 30,000 hunting hounds, grouped in 390 packs, according to the national hunting federation.</p>
      <p>"These dogs are trained to hunt a particular animal and obey man in all circumstances," the federation said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Eric Tramson, a dog trainer specialising in aggressive dogs, told AFP that packs of hounds are "conditioned to kill and can be dangerous."</p>
      <p>But he said a dog could also turn on its own owner if attacked while on a leash.</p>
