      <h1>Carved rock could be world's oldest chess piece</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:44:16+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:44</time> by <a rel="author">Christopher Carbone</a></address>
      <p>A small object that was discovered in what's now southern Jordan seems to be the world's oldest known chess piece.</p>
      <p>The retangular piece of rock with two horn-shaped points on top looks like rooks, or castles, that have been found at other Islamic sites nearby.</p>
      <p>John Oleson, an archaeologist at the University of Victoria in Canada, discussed <a href="http://www.asor.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-Abstract-Book_posted_10-28-19.pdf">his analysis</a> of the rock on Thursday at a meeting of the American Schools of Oriental Research.</p>
      <p>“Chess became very popular in the early Islamic world,” Oleson <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/carved-rock-found-jordan-may-be-oldest-known-chess-piece">told Science News</a>.</p>

      <p>Surviving written accounts show that chess originated in India at least 1,400 years ago, according to the science outlet.</p>
      <p>The game also reportedly brought people from diverse backgrounds together, with ancient Islamic texts showing chess matches between Muslims and Christians, as well as the rich and poor.</p>
      <p>The potentially record-setting rook is being stored in the basement of Oleson's house in Canada,</p>
