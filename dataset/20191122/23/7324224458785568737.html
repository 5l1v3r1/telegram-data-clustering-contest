      <p>Apple has delayed the theatrical release of its first original film, The Banker, amid misconduct allegations against one of the film’s co-producers.</p>
      <p>The film’s December 6 release is being delayed days after Apple cancelled the film’s premiere at the AFI Film Festival in Los Angeles, citing unspecified concerns about the movie and saying it needed time to review them.</p>
      <p>The Hollywood Reporter published a story that said the premiere was cancelled after two relatives of Bernard Garrett Jr, who is a co-producer on the film, accused him of molesting them when they were girls.</p>

      <p>The film is based on the life of Mr Garrett’s father, Bernard, who in the 1950s and 1960s recruited a white man to pose as the face of his expansive property and banking business. Bernard Garrett, who is played by Anthony Mackie in the film, was convicted of misusing bank funds in 1968.</p>
      <p>The Banker also stars Samuel L Jackson, Nia Long and Nicholas Hoult.</p>
      <p>Apple said: “We purchased The Banker earlier this year as we were moved by the film’s entertaining and educational story about social change and financial literacy.</p>
      <p>“Last week some concerns surrounding the film were brought to our attention. We, along with the filmmakers, need some time to look into these matters and determine the best next steps.”</p>
      <p>The film had been slated to appear on the new Apple TV Plus streaming service after its theatrical release, but no details on those plans have been released.</p>
