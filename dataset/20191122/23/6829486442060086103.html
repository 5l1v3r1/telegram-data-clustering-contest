      <h1>Manny Jacinto Of ‘The Good Place’ Protested Climate Inaction While Looking Extremely Hot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:30:10+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:30</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>Over the last few months, actress and activist Jane Fonda has used her public profile to protest the U.S. government’s inaction on climate change.</p>
      <p>Fonda, who has been an active participant in leftist movements since her days campaigning against the Vietnam War, has even been arrested for her actions. She has refused to budge in the face of police and has even rallied her famous friends around her for support, drawing more and more attention to an extremely pressing issue.</p>
      <p>A few weeks ago, <a href="https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/celebrities-gone-bad/jane-fonda-and-ted-danson-have-been-arrested-at-a-washington-protest/news-story/0d79e157bef54af76c86b2d0bff87517">Fonda brought along Ted Danson for the ride.</a> Now, she’s brought along another <a href="https://junkee.com/tag/the-good-place"><i>The Good Place</i></a> star — Manny Jacinto.</p>
      <p>Jacinto is best known for three things — portraying the sweet and bumbling Jason Mendoza on the show, being kind and respectful in interviews, and for being extremely hot.</p>
      <p>I mean, just look at him:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Indeed, his hotness made him an extremely important addition to the protest. After all, there’s nothing the internet loves more than a very attractive person revealing that they are also sensitive, intelligent and kind, and Jacinto being there has the internet in a total hubbub.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>I mean, who can blame any of us for getting ourselves so worked up over a man that looks like that? Let alone a man who uses said looks to draw attention to environmental degradation and the need to properly implement green policies?</p>
