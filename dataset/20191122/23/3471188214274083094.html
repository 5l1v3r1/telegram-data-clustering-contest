      <h1>Google Photos will soon let you draw on your photos like Snapchat</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:48:05+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:48</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Rowland</a></address>
      <p>Google likes to work on its favourite products, and Photos is definitely on that list, with new features coming every so often to make the experience better and better still. A new feature coming soon could be an image annotation tool, and I’ve been waiting for this for a while.</p>
      <p>The new feature was <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/21/google-photos-is-getting-a-markup-tool-in-the-image-editor/">reported by <i>Android Police</i> earlier this week</a>, and it looks as if the update will allow users to draw over images like Snapchat does – draw with coloured pens and line types.</p>
      <p>The feature will not be unfamiliar, as most Android smartphones offer a similar tool in their built-in Gallery apps; Huawei and Samsung definitely offer features like this in their photo management tools, but Google has been a notable absence in the space.</p>
      <p>Once the feature becomes more widely available, it will appear in the bottom of the editing UI – readily accessible for when you need to draw over a photo to highlight a feature, for example.</p>

      <p>The feature appears to be fairly simple, and so it should be; it’s not intended to be a mobile Photoshop – there are plenty of other apps for that. This is just a simple tool to let you mark up a photo/document/screenshot before sharing it to illustrate something quick and easily.</p>
      <p>We’ve not seen the feature in Australia yet, but if the screenshots are anything to go by, it probably won’t be too far away.</p>
