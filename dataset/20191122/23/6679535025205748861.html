      <p>A former CIA case agent has been sentenced to 19 years in prison for an espionage conspiracy with China.</p>
      <p>Fifty-five-year-old Jerry Chun Shing Lee was sentenced Friday in federal court in Alexandria after his guilty plea earlier this year.</p>
      <p>He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage, but prosecutors and defence lawyers disagreed about the extent of the crime.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say Chinese intelligence officers gave Lee more than USD 8,40,000 and that Lee likely gave them all the information he had from a 13-year career as a CIA case officer. They sought a prison term of more than 20 years.</p>
      <p>Defence lawyers say the government never proved that the money came from China or that Lee ever carried out any plans to deliver government secrets. They asked for a 10-year sentence.</p>
