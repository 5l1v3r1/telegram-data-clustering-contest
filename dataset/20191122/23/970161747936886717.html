      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/gogglebox/">Gogglebox</a> viewers were treated to a slice of politics on Friday night as the on-screen families watched a sponsored party election broadcast from the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/liberal-democrats/">Liberal Democrats</a>.</p>
      <p>With party leader <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jo-swinson/">Jo Swinson</a> fronting the campaign, the Gogglebox clan were not impressed by the trailer, which tried to play on Jo’s reliability.</p>
      <p>With the opening shot showing Jo going out for a run (in a rather fluorescent orange top), the families were having none of the political leader’s antics, asking how she was managing to ‘smile and run’ at the same time.</p>
      <p>In the next scene, Jo is seen tidying her home while telling the audience that they can create a brighter future: ‘For my children, for your children and for the country we love.’</p>
      <p>However, the families were skeptical, with Siddiqui sibling Baasit asking: ‘Has the fact that’s in her house and that setting made her more relatable, though?’</p>

      <p>‘Not really, I always knew Jo Swinson had a house,’ brother Umar hilariously replied, ‘And that she wore shoes… and did things. It’s no surprise to me.’</p>

      <p>With a following shot seeing Jo travel on a train, there was a considerable amount of cynicism from the eye rolling Michael family, with son Louis sarcastically saying: ‘Oh, she gets the train, just like everyone else.’</p>
      <p>As Jo went on to mention ‘saving the planet’, Louis continued: ‘They’re going to cure all diseases, they’re going to end poverty, they’re going to discover alien life.’</p>
      <p>However, it was Jo’s closing words of ‘join us’ that seemed to rub the TV personalities up the wrong way, with zombie-style impersonations cries of ‘joooiiin us’ echoing across the show.</p>
      <p>‘She’s not even saying vote, she’s saying join the Liberal Democrats,’ Umar repeated. ‘Can you join a party and then vote for another party?’</p>
      <p>Ah well Jo, better luck next time.</p>
