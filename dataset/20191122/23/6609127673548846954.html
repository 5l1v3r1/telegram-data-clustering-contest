      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a>, under former Reds great Alex McLeish, tried to sign Considine Jr in 2003.</p>
      <p>But the move ultimately jolted the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14898/aberdeen/">Pittodrie outfit</a> into ensuring the academy graduate stayed put.</p>
      <p>The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
      <p>Considine Sr told <i>SunSport</i>: “It’s true, Rangers tried to sign Andrew while he was a youth player at Aberdeen and still waiting for his breakthrough.</p>

      <p>“George Adams was head of youth at Rangers and someone I knew well from my time at Aberdeen and he was a big fan of Andrew’s.</p>
      <p>"As a family we have a high regard for George and we knew he would look after him if he’d gone to Glasgow.</p>
      <p>“Andrew was 16 and I thought he was doing quite well at Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>“But very few actually get signed up. In fact, I’m not sure if there was anyone else signed from Andrew’s year.</p>
      <p>“At one point, we thought he could leave. We didn’t know which way it would go. Aberdeen were playing their cards close to their chest.</p>
      <p>“All the 16-year-olds at the time were waiting to hear of their fate. Then Rangers made known their interest in signing Andrew.</p>
      <p>“After that it didn’t take long for the phone call to come from Aberdeen to go back in and talk.</p>

      <p>“Andrew signed and it was great for him and all of the family. We were all very proud.</p>
      <p>“But, honestly, I didn’t think he would be with Aberdeen all his life. It’s remarkable how things have worked out.</p>
      <p>“It’s great credit to Andrew for his dedication, professionalism and ability to have consistently proved himself over 15 years for various managers.”</p>
      <p>Considine Jr is under contract until 2021 and there’s every chance the 32-year-old will see out his career with the Dons.</p>
      <p>Doug, a member of the 1980 Premier League-winning squad, said: “Aberdeen’s one of the biggest clubs in the country and he should be very proud of himself for what he’s done so far.</p>
      <p>“I see no reason why he can’t carry on for a good bit yet. Playing for Aberdeen means so much to him.</p>
      <p>“I still feel emotional every time watching him come out the tunnel with the Aberdeen strip on. It’s a club that will always be close to my heart.”</p>
      <p>Asked how he feels things would have worked out for his boy if he had signed for Rangers, Considine Sr added: “It’s very hard to tell.</p>
      <p>“I like to think he’d have still gone on to be a success for Rangers or anywhere else he would have gone.</p>
      <p>“Andrew has a very good football brain and he uses it well. He’s shown that by the number of games he’s managed to play for Aberdeen.”</p>
