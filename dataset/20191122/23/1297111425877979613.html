      <p>The University of Regina Rams’ Greg Nesbitt is the 2019 recipient of Football Canada’s Geno Fracas Award.</p>
      <p>The award recognizes a U Sports assistant coach who works tirelessly for the players’ benefit while supporting his fellow coaches.</p>
      <p>Nesbitt received the award Thursday at the U Sports All-Canadian Gala in Quebec City.</p>
      <p>A retired social worker, Nesbitt recently completed his 16th season as a Rams assistant. He has been a defensive line coach and scout team co-ordinator during that time.</p>
      <p>Nesbitt was a defensive lineman with the junior Rams from 1976 to 1980. He helped the team win two Canadian Junior Football League championships.</p>

      <p>He has also been a guest coach at three Saskatchewan Roughriders training camps.</p>
      <p>“Greg takes pride in his work and has made a difference in the lives of the players he’s instructed throughout the years while earning the respect of the coaches in our football program, the league and nation,” Rams head coach Steve Bryce said in a media release.</p>
