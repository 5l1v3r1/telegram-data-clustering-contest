      <p>The 56-year-old was <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/news/tottenham-confirm-jose-mourinho-as-new-manager_379969.html">announced as the club's new manager</a> on Wednesday following the sacking of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a> the night before.</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic, who left <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/la-galaxy/"><b>Los Angeles Galaxy</b></a> earlier this month, is said to be <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/transfer-talk/news/mourinho-interested-in-bringing-ibrahimovic-to-spurs_380165.html">on Mourinho's radar</a> ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>According to <i>La Repubblica</i>, Mourinho personally contacted Ibrahimovic to see if he wanted another spell in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Mourinho brought Ibrahimovic to Manchester United in July 2016 on a free transfer that proved highly successful, with the Swede netting 28 goals in all competitions during his debut campaign at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/ibrahimovic-open-to-serie-a-return_375659.html">Reports have suggested</a> that a return to Serie A was the most likely option for the 38-year-old, who has previously enjoyed spells at Juventus, Inter Milan and AC Milan.</p>
