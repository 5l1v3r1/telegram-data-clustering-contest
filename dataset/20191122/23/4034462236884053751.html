      <h1>The Sky Really Is The Limit When Ordering A New Rolls-Royce</h1>
      <h2>Just look at the custom embroidery inside this one-off Wraith.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:30:33+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:30</time> by <a rel="author">Noah Joseph</a></address>
      <p>The popularity of Rolls-Royce's Bespoke Design services are such that few new vehicles ever leave the automaker's factory at Goodwood without <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/almost-every-rolls-royce-made-is-unique">some measure or another of customization</a>. That ranges from custom paint-jobs to unique interior appointments – like embroidery, for example. And this is the most intricate such project the luxury automaker's personalization department has ever undertaken.</p>
      <p>One client, evidently not satisfied with the stunning <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/unique-rolls-royce-wraith-features-over-800-stars-in-the-headline">Starlight Headliner</a> option, commissioned the Rolls-Royce Bespoke Collective to intricately embroider on the ceiling of his <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/rolls-royce/wraith">Wraith</a> fastback the image of a peregrine falcon – one of the fastest animals in the world.</p>

      <p>The product of over a month's work, the image consists of some 250,000 individual stitches. But it wasn't just a matter of embroidering the image. "The design required hours of observation of a Peregrine Falcon – we needed to understand the musculature, the movement, the shading of the feathers," said Rolls-Royce's embroidery specialist Josh Lilies. "The Falcon embroidery became a labour of love. Technically, it is exceptionally difficult to embroider this density of stitches onto leather. Embroidery puts stress and tension on leather causing a physical wave in the material, which naturally, is unacceptable in a Rolls-Royce."</p>

      <p>Aside from the embroidered falcon, the unique commission also entailed painting the vehicle in a unique shade of Bala Blue and Andalusian White, with a hand-painted Arctic White coachline in a motif that continues inside the Charles Blue leather interior on the piano-finish fascia and between the rear seats.</p>
      <p>We might hazard a guess at where this unique ride's commissioning customer may be from, given the popularity of both Rolls-Royces and the sport of <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/mulliner-builds-unimaginably-useless-bentayga-for-world-s-most-obscure-sport">falconry</a> in a certain part of the world. But location aside, we could hardly think of a more suitable canvas for the work.</p>
