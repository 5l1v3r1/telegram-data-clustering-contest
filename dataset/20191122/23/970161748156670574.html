      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kristen-bell/">Kristen Bell</a> has revealed that she felt ‘no spark’ with husband <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dax-shepard/">Dax Shepard</a> when they first met back in 2007.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-good-place/">The Good Place</a> star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/07/25/kristen-bell-breaks-down-in-tears-as-she-remembers-her-109-wedding-to-dax-shepard-6027371/">tied the knot with Dax in 2013</a>, with the couple having <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/11/kristen-bell-sounds-off-on-six-year-old-daughters-decision-to-shave-her-head-10899822/">two young children together</a>.</p>
      <p>However, telling the story of their first meeting, 39-year-old Kristen revealed that the pair didn’t get off to the best start.</p>
      <p>‘The producer of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Shauna Robertson, who’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/judd-apatow/">Judd Apatow</a>‘s previous producing partner, had a birthday dinner, like 10 people, at a sushi restaurant,’ she recalled to Sunday TODAY with Willie Geist.</p>
      <p>‘I had just gotten out of a long term relationship two months prior… he had just gotten out of a long relationship.</p>
      <p>‘We were sitting at a table,’ she continued. ‘The only thing I remember is that he talked so much. This guy can talk.’</p>

      <p>Even more embarrassingly, Kristen had no idea who Dax was, thinking that she’d recognised the Punk’d star from Jackass instead.</p>

      <p>‘I didn’t know who he was,’ Kristen admitted. ‘I’m like, “Is that one of the guys from Jackass or something?” Then we left. There were no sparks whatsoever.’</p>
      <p>It wasn’t until they ran into each other a second time that Bell saw the potential of a romantic connection.</p>
      <p>Luckily, the pair’s joint love of hockey brought them together, with Dax flirting with the Veronica Mars star at a game a couple of weeks later.</p>
      <p>‘[The] day after that I get a text that says, “Hi, my name is Dax. I violated your privacy and got your number from Shauna. How do you feel about that?” And I was like, “Excuse me? You sound stimulating.”’</p>
      <p>A move like that might not work on everyone, but it definitely worked for Kristen.</p>
      <p>She beamed: ‘He’s so bold and that was my kind of person. I was like, okay, starting it off with a really good joke that makes me feel butterflies. I fell in love with him way before he fell in love with me.’</p>
