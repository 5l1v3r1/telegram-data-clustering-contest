      <p>Police officers in the city’s subway system slapped the street artist behind the popular ‘Post-it Note’ wall with a summons Thursday, sparking a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/09/arrest-of-brooklyn-churro-vendor-sparks-outrage-on-twitter/">new round of outrage</a> over the controversial ‘quality of life’ crackdown underground.</p>

      <p>The NYPD issued the ticket after the MTA called and complained that some posters left behind profane messages on the installation, which lived on the tiled wall of a tunnel that links 6th and 7th Avenue stations on 14th Street.</p>
      <p>Artist Matthew Chavez was hit with a $25 citation — his first — for posting signage in city subway stations.</p>
      <p>The cops “told me they were asked to write a citation by the MTA,” Chavez told The Post in an email on Friday. “An MTA employee was going to clean the wall of the station, and the sticky notes were in the way of that.”</p>
      <p>MTA spokesman Tim Minton said in a statement to The Post that station staff “became aware that among Post-it Notes on a subway passage wall were some that contained lewd, offensive, and profane language.”</p>
      <p>“The individual involved with the project was cooperative in removing messages, and we appreciate New Yorkers’ desire to express themselves, but it must follow the rules,” Minton said.</p>
      <p>The MTA provided a photo to The Post of specific notes that contained messages it deemed “offensive,” which included notes that read “I’m so hard,” “high af,” “stressed tf out,” and “f—ked up in the head.”</p>
      <p>WNYC’s Gothamist site <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/mta-hiring-500-new-cops-fix-quality-life-issues-subway-system">first broke the news</a> of Chavez’s ticket.</p>
      <p>The policing crackdown in the subways has come under intense scrutiny after a series of arrests were caught on tape, including <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/churro-vendor-emotionally-recounts-being-arrested-by-cops-in-subway/">the firestorm that followed the arrest</a> of a churro vendor at a subway station in Queens.</p>
      <p>Chavez <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/11/10/emotional-election-post-its-cover-subway-station/">created the Post-it wall</a> in the wake of the 2016 election of President Trump as a way for straphangers to vent.</p>
      <p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who controls the MTA, <a href="https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/798334412882636800">joined the crowds leaving messages</a> and put up a Post-it Note that quoted the Statue of Liberty’s inscription.</p>
      <p>The project evolved in the months that followed as more than 50,000 people from all over the world left messages, according to Chavez’ website.</p>
      <p>After the ticket incident, Chavez said he “removed all the notes,” and added that it’s something he “would have done even if I hadn’t received the citation.”</p>
      <p>“These installations are meant to be ephemeral, and I don’t want them to turn into trash, or become the MTA’s responsibility to remove,” Chavez said.</p>
      <p>Chavez said in the past, the MTA “has been nice about” his “Subway Therapy” project.</p>
      <p>“They always let me take the notes down and keep them, which is incredibly important to the project,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I always put the notes up in the middle of the day, and take them down in the evening anyway, but being asked to leave comes with the territory of not asking for permission in the first place,” he said.</p>
