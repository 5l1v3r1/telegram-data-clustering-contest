      <h3>TOP STORY: Juve interested in Emerson</h3>
      <p>Juventus are interested in signing Chelsea left-back <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/159051/Emerson-Palmieri">Emerson Palmieri</a></b>, <a href="https://www.corrieredellosport.it/calcio/">Corriere dello Sport</a> reports.</p>
      <p>The Old Lady have been struggling to find the right combination at the back since the start of the season, with Maurizio Sarri making it clear that he wanted to go into the market in January to try to mix things up. Now, it appears as if he could get his wish.</p>
      <p>With <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/125514/Alex-Sandro">Alex Sandro</a> being the only left-back on the books, Emerson is a primary target for Juve as they attempt to strengthen their grip on the Serie A title race.</p>

      <h3>Juve to make contact over Eriksen</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.corrieredellosport.it/calcio/">Corriere dello Sport</a> writes that Juventus could make contact with Tottenham Hotspur over the potential signing of <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/144130/Christian-Eriksen">Christian Eriksen</a></b>.</p>
      <p>The Denmark international was strongly linked with a move away from North London last summer, with Real Madrid the most club most consistently credited with interest, however it didn't quite come to fruition.</p>
      <p>Eriksen's contract with Tottenham is set to expire in June, opening the door for him to explore his options away from the club.</p>
      <h3>Fraser's options open amid Liverpool interest</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/liverpool-fc-transfer-news-latest-ryan-fraser-bournemouth-eddie-howe-a9214031.html">The Independent</a> reports that Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe has confirmed that <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/153012/Ryan-Fraser">Ryan Fraser</a></b> is keeping his options open ahead of the January transfer window, with Liverpool being interested in making a deal happen. When asked about Fraser's future, Howe had the following to say:</p>
      <p>"We've had conversations with Ryan to try and persuade him to stay but, at the moment, he's keeping his options open."</p>
      <p>With Fraser not yet putting pen to paper on any sort of deal, the Cherries will be keeping a close eye on proceedings as we get closer and closer to the winter window opening.</p>
      <h3>Tap-ins</h3>
      <p>- Juventus winger <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/187956/Marko-Pjaca">Marko Pjaca</a></b> could be set for another loan away from the club, <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/juve-il-futuro-di-pjaca-65535">Calciomercato</a> reports. The Croatia international has failed to live up to the hype that his reputation demanded, and after spending time with Schalke and Fiorentina, Pjaca looks to be on his way out once again with Juve aiming to ship him off in January.</p>
      <p>- Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson has said he isn't considering the possibility of allowing <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/106957/Christian-Benteke">Christian Benteke</a></b> to leave the club, <a href="https://www.football.london/crystal-palace-fc/roy-hodgson-outlines-crystal-palace-17303912">Football.London</a> reports. The Belgian was said to be contemplating the possibility of leaving Selhurst Park during the international break, but Hodgson wants to give him more time to shine in the first team.</p>
