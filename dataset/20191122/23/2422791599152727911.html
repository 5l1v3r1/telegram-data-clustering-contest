      <h1>John Bolton returns to Twitter after claim of White House freeze</h1>

      <p>WASHINGTON - Former national security adviser John Bolton says he's regained control of his personal Twitter account, asserting the White House refused to provide access to it after he resigned, a charge U.S. President Donald Trump rejected.</p>
      <p>Bolton's actions and words are being closely followed in the House impeachment inquiry. He has declined to testify unless a federal judge determines he can be compelled to testify against the White House's wishes.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/AmbJohnBolton/status/1197982064945094657">Bolton issued a series of tweets</a> that began with him saying he was glad to be back on Twitter and to "stay tuned."</p>
      <p>A third tweet accused the White House of refusing to return access to the account, asking, "Out of fear of what I may say?"</p>
      <p>Finally, Bolton thanked Twitter for "standing by their community standards" and "rightfully returning control."</p>
