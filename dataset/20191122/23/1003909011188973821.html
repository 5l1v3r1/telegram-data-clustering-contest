      <h1>Bashed by a hurricane, Bahamas back open for business</h1>

      <p>Known for its warm hospitality, the Bahamas had one unwanted guest stay far too long this fall.</p>
      <p>On Sept. 1, Hurricane Dorian swept in and refused to leave for 48 hours days, packing with it 295 km/h winds and delivering a devastating blow to parts of the country. The northern Abaco islands were flattened and the east end of Grand Bahama sustained damage. But the rest of the Caribbean country escaped mostly unscathed.</p>
      <p>That message, that the Bahamas is open and ready for tourists, is being urgently repeated by tourism officials on a cross-country tour of Canada this week.</p>
      <p>“There is no better time to go to the Bahamas than now. After all, the best way to help the Bahamas is to visit the Bahamas,” said Dionisio D’Aguilar, minister of tourism and aviation.</p>
      <p>“Hurricane Dorian and the destruction it wrought on Abaco and Freeport has dominated the news cycle and will probably be the most urgent and influential story about the Bahamas for some time to come. At least as urgent, if not more so however, is the story that the Bahamas is still standing.”</p>
      <p>D’Aguilar noted that the Bahamas is a collection of 700 islands and 2,500 cays that span almost 1,000 kilometres and the hurricane only hit the two northernmost islands.</p>
      <p>“Thankfully it left the rest of the country completely unscathed, untouched, and not in any way impacted.”</p>
      <p>Prior to the hurricane, the Bahamas was having a record year in tourism. Stopover arrivals in the eight months prior were up 13 per cent, with arrivals from Canada up another 10 per cent. After Dorian, arrivals from Canada declined by 15 per cent in September and are predicted to be down another five per cent in October.</p>
      <p>D’Aguilar said they are “profoundly grateful” for the outpouring of support, from equipment and expertise to donations that came following the hurricane. But the biggest driver of their economy is tourism and it’s crucial for the country to regain its foothold as a premium destination.</p>
      <p>“That is why this mission is truly so important,” added Joy Jibrilu, director general of the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism. “Tourism is the cornerstone of the Bahamian economy. Fifty per cent of the Bahamian economy is derived from tourism, two out of every three jobs, the annual GDP is approximately $12 billion.</p>
      <p>“The best way that the world can help us is by continuing to come and visit those islands that were not impacted.”</p>
      <p>To that end, the Bahamas has called on one of its best-known residents to act as ambassador for the beleaguered country. American rocker Lenny Kravitz, whose mother was Bahamian, is front and centre in a new brand campaign along with his Grammy Award-winning song Fly Away.</p>
