      <h3>Days after Carlton star Charlie Curnow underwent more knee surgery, the Blues have suffered another setback with Harry McKay sidelined until after Christmas.</h3>
      <p>The young key forward has been dealing with a groin problem since Carlton’s season ended in August and the issue flared up again early in the pre-season, following a period of rest over the off-season.</p>
      <p>McKay, who Carlton selected at Pick 10 in the 2015 National draft, produced his best season yet in 2019, finishing with 26.30 from 20 games – both career-high numbers.</p>

      <p>The 21-year-old will complete a modified training program away from the main group until the Blues return in the New Year.</p>
      <p>"We gave Harry a short period of rest and his groins settled down really well. As we built him up slowly, his groins got a little bit sore," high performance boss Andrew Russell said.</p>
      <p>"We've had to pull him back a little bit and restrengthen that area.</p>
      <p>"We'll progress him back into ball work in the new year."</p>
      <p>While McKay’s setback isn’t likely to delay his start to next season, Curnow is set to be sidelined for up to four months and may not be fit in time to face Richmond on the opening night of the 2020 season.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has endured a nightmare run with his knee this year, injuring it twice during the season – costing him 10 games – before dislocating his kneecap playing basketball last month.</p>

      <p>Curnow suffered his latest knee injury when he slipped on tiles while walking upstairs on Wednesday, before undergoing surgery on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Blues are confident Curnow will return to his best in 2020, but the young gun is now facing a frustrating summer ahead.</p>
      <p>"It’s a new injury: it’s not exactly the same as the one he had," Russell said.</p>
      <p>"We’re really confident that Charlie is going to be back and in good shape.</p>
      <p>"The program that we put in place will be a really solid and robust program so that when you see him again, he’s going to be moving extremely well."</p>
