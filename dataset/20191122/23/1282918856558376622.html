      <h3>Poll strategist Prashant Kishor has been considered the braindchild behind the mega alliance of Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP forming government in Maharashtra.</h3>

      <p>In a massive development, poll strategist Prashant Kishor has been considered the brainchild behind the mega alliance of Shiv Sena, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) forming the government in Maharashtra. The development takes place after the stalemate between the 'Mahayuti' alliance of Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the post of the Chief Minister prevailed for almost a month after the declaration of results. Although, it was reported that Kishor was appointed to reestablish Shiv Sena as the leading National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ally, he became instrumental in the government formation in the state for Shiv Sena. Speculations are that Kishor started working on it almost a year ago. </p>
