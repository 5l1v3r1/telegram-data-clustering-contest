      <p>He is believed to have left his dad's house in the Ardler area around 11.45am.</p>
      <p>Connor was then caught on camera around 1pm at a Morrisons store near Pitkerro Road in the north-east of Dundee.</p>
      <p>He is described as 5ft6in tall, with a stocky build and short, dark hair.</p>
      <p>Connor - who has a one-year-old son - was wearing his work clothes when he went missing: a grey hoodie, black trousers and a pair of beige boots.</p>
      <p>His brother Jordan launched a social media plea to try and trace his younger sibling following his disappearance.</p>
      <p>He shared pictures of Connor and asked for anyone with information to get in touch.</p>
      <p>His mum Laura also took to Facebook to appeal for help from locals.</p>
      <p>She also said she was "extremely worried" about her son.</p>
      <p>Anyone with any information about Connor is urged to contact police on 101 quoting incident number 1698 or speak to an officer in the area.</p>
