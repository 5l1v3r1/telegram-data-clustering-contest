      <h1>C.D.C. Issues E. Coli Warning on Romaine Lettuce Ahead of Thanksgiving</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:16:46+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:16</time> by <a rel="author">Aimee Ortiz</a></address>
      <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned consumers on Friday not to eat any romaine lettuce from Salinas, Calif., after <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2019/o157h7-11-19/index.html">at least 40 cases of E. coli infection nationwide</a> were linked to contaminated products from that region.</p>
      <p>In a statement detailing the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2019/o157h7-11-19/map.html">E. coli outbreak, which has affected 16 states and left at least 28 people hospitalized</a>, the C.D.C. also advised retailers not to sell any lettuce harvested in Salinas.</p>
      <p>No deaths have been reported, but at least five people developed a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome, the agency said.</p>
      <p>The strain behind the outbreak, E. coli O157:H7, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/general/index.html">produces a Shiga toxin</a> that can cause painful cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting. Roughly 5 to 10 percent of the people who fall sick from that type of E. coli develop <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/ecoli-symptoms.html">hemolytic uremic syndrome</a>, a potentially life-threatening complication that occurs most commonly in young children under 5 years, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems, according to the agency.</p>
      <p>People began to get sick from Sept. 24 to Nov. 10, the agency said.</p>
      <p>The strain behind this year’s outbreak is the same as that in other E. coli outbreaks linked to romaine lettuce and leafy greens in the past two years, the C.D.C. said.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-brief/fda-brief-fda-warns-consumers-not-eat-romaine-lettuce-grown-salinas-california">Food and Drug Administration said in a statement Friday</a> that it was sending investigators to farms in Salinas, Calif., to look for the source of contamination.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the United States Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2019/recall-115-2019-release">issued a recall of more than 75,000 pounds of prepackaged salads from the New Jersey-based company Missa Bay</a> as the lettuce is possibly contaminated with E. coli.</p>
      <p>The recalled products have “use by” dates ranging from Oct. 29 to Nov. 2, according to the C.D.C.</p>
      <p>“The products identified are already significantly past their use-by dates, so this voluntary recall most likely does not affect any product currently on store shelves,” <a href="https://www.readypac.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/E.-Coli-Illnesses-Statement-112019.pdf">Ready Pac Foods said in a statement</a> on Thursday. “We are working with our retailers to help ensure that this is the case.” Missa Bay produced the recalled products for Ready Pac Foods, the company said.</p>
      <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the outbreak includes all types of romaine lettuce that were harvested from the Salinas growing region of California, including prepackaged salads, whole heads of romaine, and romaine hearts.</p>
      <p>The salads, which were shipped to more than 20 states, have the number “EST. 18502B” inside the Agriculture Department mark of inspection. Consumers should look for that number to know if their product was subject to recall, according to the department.</p>
      <p>The C.D.C. suggested consumers throw out any lettuce packaged with the word “Salinas” on the label or if they are unsure of where the lettuce was grown or if a salad mix has romaine lettuce in it. Washing and sanitizing the drawer where the lettuce was kept <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181123050611/https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/communication/clean-refrigerator-steps.html">is also recommended</a>.</p>
