      <h1>UK citizens at risk of death penalty or Guantanamo Bay under new deal with US, parliamentary inquiry warns</h1>
      <h2><b>Exclusive:</b> Extraditions set to rise with fast-track data-sharing – but investigation pours scorn on claim that UK can secure ‘credible assurances’ to prevent executions</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:08:18+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:08</time> by <a rel="author">Rob Merrick</a></address>
      <p>UK citizens are at risk of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DeathPenalty">death penalty</a> in the US – or of being sent to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/GuantanamoBay">Guantanamo Bay</a> – under a fast-track data-sharing deal struck by <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/priti-patel">Priti Patel</a>, a parliamentary inquiry is warning.</p>
      <p>The home secretary also comes under fire for keeping the details of the agreement reached with Washington under wraps <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-data-agreement-privacy-a9142066.html">when it was announced as a breakthrough</a> last month.</p>
      <p>The deal will give police and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/intelligence-services">intelligence agencies</a> speedy access to electronic communications sent by terrorists, serious crime gangs and white-collar criminals.</p>
      <p>But the investigation, by a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/HouseOfLords">House of Lords</a> committee, has poured scorn on a claim that the UK will be able to contain “credible assurances” that extradited suspects will not be put to death.</p>
      <p>It also strongly criticises the “asymmetric” nature of the arrangement – which will give the US far greater powers to target UK citizens than vice-versa.</p>
      <p>Robin Hodgson, a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/conservative">Conservative</a> peer and former MP, told <i>The Independent</i>: “What does that mean? What is a credible assurance?</p>
      <p>“Where there is separation of powers, how does a politician give a credible assurance that a court will not impose the death penalty, or – if it does impose it – carry it out?</p>
      <p>“As a result of this agreement, someone could be sent to the US, sentenced to death and live on death row forever – or put to death, unless that credible assurance works.”</p>
      <p>Lord Hodgson, who chairs the Lords’ Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee, also pointed to the vastly different powers the agreement will hand to London and Washington.</p>
      <p>The UK would only be allowed to obtain data on its own citizens – while the US would be able to demand it from a UK citizen travelling abroad, or an EU citizen living in the UK but abroad.</p>

      <p>“We are making it clear that that the next parliament should ask ministers to explain that asymmetry and that extraordinary wording about obtaining credible assurances,” Lord Hodgson added.</p>
      <p>The committee’s report, published as parliament was dissolved for the general election, also criticised the “alarming” risk of the handover of data leading to a UK citizen’s transfer to Guantanamo Bay.</p>
      <p>The notorious US camp, on the island of Cuba, remains open with around 40 prisoners, despite international condemnation of the indefinite detention and torture of terror suspects.</p>
      <p>In evidence to the peers, the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Home_Office">Home Office</a> argued the risk of a UK citizen being extradited and sent to Guantanamo Bay was “very limited” but “theoretically possible”.</p>
      <p>But their report concluded: “While these assurances are helpful, given the gravity of the matter, we take the view that even a theoretical possibility is alarming.”</p>
      <p>The controversy comes after strong criticism of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sajid-javid">Sajid Javid</a>, the then-home secretary, for paving the way for two notorious British <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/isis">Isis</a> fighters <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/uk-isis-beatles-death-penalty-sajid-javid-us-extradition-james-foley-jeff-sessions-a8459556.html">to be sent to the US, despite the risk of execution</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/alexanda-kotey">Alexanda Kotey</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/el-shafee-elsheikh">El Shafee Elsheikh</a>, from the so-called “Beatles” cell, were transferred from detention in Syria into US custody in Iraq last month and are expected to be flown to the US to face the death penalty.</p>
      <p>Now the new data-sharing agreement is poised to trigger more such cases by replacing the current, cumbersome “mutual legal assistance” treaty with fast-track arrangements.</p>
      <p>It currently takes police and security services between six months and two years to request and obtain electronic data, the government says.</p>
      <p>The new deal will compel <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Google">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Twitter">Twitter</a> to hand over the content of emails, texts and direct messages – and require the same of UK companies holding information sought by US investigators.</p>
      <p>Ms Patel last month hailed the historic agreement as the way to “dramatically speed up investigations, allowing our law enforcement agencies to protect the public”.</p>
      <p>However, it had not approved by parliament before dissolution, ensuring it will be a controversy when the new crop of MPs gathers after the election on 12 December.</p>
      <p>The Home Office declined to respond to the criticisms, but pointed out that the US would not be permitted to target people while they were in the UK.</p>
