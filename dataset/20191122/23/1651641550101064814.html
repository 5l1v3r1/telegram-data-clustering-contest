      <p>OnePlus today reported a security breach that led to a third-party accessing customer data without due authorisation.</p>
      <p>“While monitoring our systems, our security team discovered that some of our users’ order information was accessed by an unauthorized party. We can confirm that all payment information, passwords and accounts are safe, but the name, contact number, email and shipping address in certain orders may have been exposed,” the OnePlus security team <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/security-notification.1144088/">said on Friday. </a></p>
      <p>The firm says that all impacted users have been contacted and the relevant authorities have been notified. For users involved, there’s no action to be taken, it’s all on OnePlus’s end. In the end, all firms have security breaches. Whether big or small, it’s an inevitability. The most important things to watch for are their transparency and mitigation.</p>
      <p>OnePlus says that it has already taken steps to make sure there aren’t any similar vulnerabilities on-site, so that’s good for some peace of mind.</p>
