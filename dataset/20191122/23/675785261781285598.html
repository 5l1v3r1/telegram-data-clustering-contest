      <p>Diego Maradona has returned to his position as manager of Argentine club Gimnasia y Esgrima - just two days after quitting the role.</p>
      <p>The Argentina legend, who is widely considered one of the greatest footballers of all time, made the announcement on social media.</p>
      <p>“I am very happy to say that I am still the technical director of Gimnasia y Esgrima," the 59-year-old said in an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5JRmRale-V/">Instagram post</a> on Friday.</p>
      <p>“I want to thank the fans and the players, because among all of us, we finally achieved political unity at the club.</p>
      <p>"I hope they deliver everything they promised me.</p>

      <p>"Thank you for your messages, for the support, for yesterday’s demonstration in 50-degree heat.”</p>
      <p>Maradona, who helped Argentina to win the 1986 World Cup under controversial circumstances, initially took charge of the club at the start of September under the condition that club president Gabriel Pellegrino stayed in his role.</p>
      <p>However, the 59-year-old suddenly announced his departure from the club - based in La Plata, near Buenos Aires - on Tuesday, prompting an emotional reaction from fans.</p>
      <p>At the time, he said he made the decision after learning that Pelllegrino would not run for election after an agreement between candidates fell through.</p>

      <p>However, <i>Reuters</i> reports that Maradona's lawyer Matias Morla told a news conference that the retired forward changed his mind after the candidates for the position agreed to put their differences aside.</p>
      <p>Maradona took charge of Gimnasia with the task of keeping them in Argentina's top division.</p>
      <p>The team were bottom of the 24-team league upon his arrival and, despite losing his first three games in charge, he has won three of the five that have followed to move them up to 22nd.</p>
      <p>It is his first coaching job in his homeland since 2010 - when he left his position as head coach of the national team following the World Cup in South Africa.</p>
