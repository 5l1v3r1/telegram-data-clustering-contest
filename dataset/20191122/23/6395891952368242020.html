      <p><b>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP)</b> - Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren has named U.S. Reps. Deb Haaland, Ayanna Pressley and Katie Porter as her campaign co-chairs.</p>
      <p>Warren made the announcement Friday on social media with a video of the congresswomen at her campaign rallies.</p>
      <p>Haaland of Albuquerque is one of the first Native American women elected to the U.S. House.</p>
      <p>Pressley was elected to her Boston-area seat after defeating a Democratic incumbent in a primary last year. She is the first black woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts.</p>
      <p>Porter represents a district south of Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear what role the co-chairs will play in the campaign.</p>
