      <p>Myles Stephenson joked that he nearly killed Andrew Maxwell with his cooking after the Irish comedian choked on a piece of camel.</p>
      <p>Friday night’s episode of I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! saw the outlaws joined by Jacqueline Jossa and Rak-Su star Stephenson.</p>
      <p>The pair brought with them a six-star meal won during the day’s Bushtucker Trial.</p>

      <p>Stephenson began cooking a meal of camel, purple congos, karkalia and asparagus shoots with bananas for dessert.</p>
      <p>But a hungry Maxwell set upon his food too quickly and in moments had started to choke.</p>
      <p>Kate Garraway and Andy Whyment repeatedly hit his back as he knelt down, eventually dislodging the meat.</p>
      <p>“Chew your food, mate – you scared us,” said Stephenson.</p>
      <p>Garraway added: “You went bright red. I was like: ‘Oh my god.”</p>

      <p>Whyment added: “Please don’t do that again, Andrew.”</p>
      <p>And Garraway added: “I can chew your meat anytime you need.”</p>
      <p>The camp burst out laughing before she added: “I didn’t mean it like that.”</p>
      <p>A worried Stephenson said: “I can’t believe I nearly killed Andrew Maxwell.”</p>

      <p>Later Maxwell stepped into the sunlight, raised his arms out and said: “Not today Lord, not today, thank you for the second chance.”</p>
