      <p>The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday conducted searches at the residence of senior Congress leader and former Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh in connection with a case of alleged corruption it registered on Wednesday against him and three former chief secretaries of the state.</p>

      <p>Other accused are retired IAS officers DS Poonia, P C Lawmuknga and O Nabakishore Singh, then project director Y Ningthem Singh, and the society’s administrative officer S Ranjit Singh.</p>
      <p>The agency carried out searches in nine locations across Aizawl, Imphal and Gurugram and officials said they seized Rs 15.47 lakh in cash and demonetised currency with a face value of Rs 36.49 lakh.</p>
