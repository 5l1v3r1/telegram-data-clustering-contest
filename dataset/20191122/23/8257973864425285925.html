      <p>Nov. 22 (UPI) -- Russian scientists killed in a nuclear explosion at a secret military testing site in August were working on "unparalleled" weapons, Russian President Vladimir Putin said.</p>
      <p>"We're talking about the most advanced and unparalleled technical ideas and solutions, about weapons designed to ensure Russia's sovereignty and security for decades to come," <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/11/22/putin-says-unparalleled-weapons-tested-at-deadly-nuclear-accident-site-a68274">Putin said</a> during a ceremony at the Kremlin on Thursday honoring the victims of the mysterious accident.</p>
      <p>The Aug. 8 explosion of a liquid propulsion system in Nyonoksa killed five scientists and two defense ministry officials and led to international concern about a brief spike in radiation levels reported by the Russian meteorological agency Rosgidomet.</p>
      <p>Information about the incident will remain "strictly classified," Kremlin spokesman <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Dmitry-Peskov/?tps=1">Dmitry Peskov</a> said Friday, according to Russian <a href="https://tass.com/politics/1091791">news agency TASS</a>.</p>
      <p>"Tests of new weapon systems were involved. For this reason it is only natural that the investigation being carried out in this connection cannot be public," Peskov said.</p>
      <p>U.S. officials previously said they believed the incident involved a nuclear-powered cruise missile Putin said was under development last year.</p>
      <p>Putin presented posthumous orders of courage awards Thursday to the widows of the scientists killed in the blast.</p>
      <p>"They were working on a very difficult, important and critical assignment," <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/474030-putin-explosion-radiation-weapon-russia/">Putin said</a> at the ceremony. "We're talking about the most advanced and cutting-edge technical ideas and solutions, unequaled anywhere in the world; the weapon that is entitled to ensure sovereignty, security of Russia for decades to come."</p>
