      <p>According to Mark Lowcock, United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, over half of the population in Syria - almost 12 million people - are in dire need of humanitarian assistance. The United Nations conducted over 5,500 delivery missions in Syria between January and September, with a record 1.1 million people provided with some food in October through cross-border deliveries.</p>
      <p>Russia, as one of the guarantors of the ceasefire in the country, carries out regular humanitarian operations across Syria.</p>
