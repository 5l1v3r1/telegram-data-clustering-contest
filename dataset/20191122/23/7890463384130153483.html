      <h1>The Witcher Netflix series reveals all episode titles, and a creepy poem</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T23:42:31+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 23:42</time> by <a rel="author">Chris J Capel</a></address>
      <p>
        <b>We’ve just a month to go before the launch of The Witcher TV series on Netflix, which is down for December 20, and we’ve already got a major piece of information about the show – every episode title from all eight “chapters” of The Witcher have been revealed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>These episode titles were all <a href="https://twitter.com/witchernetflix/status/1197877217218433027">tweeted out</a> by the official The Witcher Netflix channel – and are mostly nonsensical, at least until we get their final context. Perhaps more interesting are the hints that accompany each tweet, which seem to point to various different scenarios – including many that fans of the original books will be familiar with.</p>
      <p>Terms such as “The Law of Surprise” – where someone saved by another has to offer their saviour a boon, usually the firstborn child – and mentions of a dragon, ‘The Witcher family’, and an apparent origin story for Yennefer feature. The fifth episode seems to be the one the introduces Jaskier, a.k.a. Dandelion the bard, one of the most popular recurring characters in both the books and games – played here by Knightfall’s Joey Batey.</p>
      <p>Even more fun is that these hints, when put together, seem to take the form of a poem: “A monster slain, a butcher named. We look at a sorceress’s earlier days. A picky eater, a family shamed. The Law of Surprise is how one repays. A fateful meeting, a bard is maimed. The hunt for a dragon is underway. A return to before a kingdom is flamed. The Witcher Family, as you all like to say.”</p>

      <p>Here are all eight episode titles in order:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The End’s Beginning</li>
        <li>Four Marks</li>
        <li>Betrayer Moon</li>
        <li>Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials</li>
        <li>Bottled Appetites</li>
        <li>Rare Species</li>
        <li>Before a Fall</li>
        <li>Much More</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Witcher series will launch on Netflix on December 20 with all eight of these episodes. The show <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/netflix-witcher-season-2-release-date">has already been renewed for a second season</a>, and showrunner Lauren Hissrich says she’s mapped out seven whole seasons already – whether it makes it that far is entirely down to how many people stream it next month, of course.</p>
