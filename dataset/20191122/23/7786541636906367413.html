      <p><b>LOS ANGELESÂ (AP)</b> - Deputies arrested a 13-year-old boy and seized a semi-automatic rifle after he threatened to shoot other students and staff at a Los Angeles-area middle school, authorities said Friday.</p>
      <p>In a separate case, a boy at another school was taken into custody involving a planned shooting.</p>
      <p>The arrests came barely a week after deputies were frantically summoned to a high school in Santa Clarita, where a 16-year-old boy killed two fellow students and took his own life.</p>
      <p>Since then, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has investigated at least 30 school threats, spokesman Sgt. Bob Boese said.</p>
      <p>The incidents that resulted in the arrests were the only ones deemed credible.</p>
      <p>At Animo Mae Jemison Charter Middle School in Willowbrook, just south of downtown Los Angeles, multiple students overheard the 13-year-old say Thursday that he would carry out the shooting on campus the following day, Sheriff Alex Villanueva said.</p>
      <p>The students alerted teachers and police were notified.</p>
      <p>Deputies searched the boy's home and discovered an AR-15-style rifle, 100 rounds of ammunition, a list of names and a drawing of the school, Villanueva said.</p>
      <p>The boy was arrested without incident on suspicion of making criminal threats. A 19-year-old male relative also was arrested on suspicion of possessing an unregistered firearm, Boese said. The man, who was not identified, was held on $35,000 bail, he said.</p>
      <p>Investigators were trying to determine who owns the gun that authorities initially called a ghost gun - a weapon without a serial number made from parts from other guns. Villanueva later clarified the weapon has a serial number.</p>
      <p>Villanueva praised school officials for quickly notifying authorities about the threat.</p>
      <p>"The fact that people stepped forward and said what they had heard led us to prevent a tragedy today," he said.</p>
      <p>The other boy was arrested Thursday in Palmdale, north of Los Angeles. Villanueva said the student at Knight High School made threats on social media following a campus fight.</p>
      <p>The sheriff said the boy acknowledged posting threats along with pictures of a teen with a gun. No weapon was recovered in the case.</p>
      <p>The sheriff's department still hasn't determined a motive for the deadly Nov. 14 shooting at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita.</p>
      <p>Villanueva said the semi-automatic pistol used by gunman Nathaniel Berhow was assembled from gun parts and did not have a serial number. Police have not determined where and when Berhow got the gun.</p>
