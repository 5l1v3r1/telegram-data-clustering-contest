      <p>Batman protects Gotham City from all kinds of criminals, whether they’re of the conventional variety or colorful freaks. Some of the latter folks who Robert Pattinson’s Caped Crusader will go up against in <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Batman-Solo-Movie-Everything-We-Know-So-Far-133317.html"><i>The Batman</i></a> include The Riddler and The Penguin, but now word’s come in straight from director Matt Reeves himself that John Turturro has been added as notorious Gotham crime boss Carmine Falcone. Here’s what the filmmaker posted:</p>

      <p>Matt Reeves has <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484802/the-batman-director-matt-reeves-is-having-too-much-fun-confirming-his-cast">been having fun lately</a> confirming castings for <i>The Batman</i> on his <a href="https://twitter.com/mattreevesLA">Twitter account</a>, and now we can officially add John Turturro’s name to the mix. Best known for movies like <i>Barton Fink</i>, <i>Quiz Show</i>, <i>The Big Lebowski</i> and <i>O Brother, Where Are Thou?</i>, this will be Turturro’s first time working on a comic book movie, though he has previous franchise experience with his work <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1653589/why-john-turturro-decided-to-join-the-transformers-movies">on the <i>Transformers</i></a> and <i>Cars</i> movies.</p>
      <p>Introduced in 1987’s <i>Batman: Year One</i> storyline, Carmine Falcone is a powerful Mafia leader, nicknamed “The Roman,” who Bruce Wayne tangles with during the early years of his vigilante career. He played an especially prominent role <a href="https://comixology.sjv.io/9aZYj">in <i>Batman: The Long Halloween</i></a>, which saw members of his family and criminal organization being gunned down by a serial killer named Holiday.</p>
      <p>Outside of the comics, Carmine Falcone was played by Tom Wilkinson in <i>Batman Begins</i> and John Doman in <i>Gotham</i>, and he’s also been featured in the animated <i>Batman: Year One</i> movie, <i>Justice League Action</i> and various video games. While not an origin story, <i>The Batman</i> will chronicle the eponymous protagonist as he’s still figuring out the Bat-ropes, so it makes sense to include Carmine Falcone, especially given the movie’s noir tone.</p>
      <p>With plot details for <i>The Batman</i> still being kept under wraps, it’s hard to say how specifically Carmine Falcone will factor into the movie, though one could easily imagine Batman tossing with some of Falcone’s goons. However, it’s been rumored that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480592/why-robert-pattinsons-batman-movie-should-definitely-adapt-the-long-halloween-comic-books"><i>The Batman</i> will be an adaptation of <i>The Long Halloween</i></a>, and the addition of Falcone lends more credence to that claim. If <i>The Long Halloween</i> is indeed being translated for the big screen, then John Turturro’s Falcone will soon find his organization slowly being dismantled.</p>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, Riddler and Penguin were already set to cause trouble in <i>The Batman</i>, with Paul Dano playing the former foe and Colin Farrell in talks to play the latter adversary. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482506/the-batman-an-updated-cast-list"><i>The Batman</i>’s cast</a> also includes Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman, Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon, Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth and Jayme Lawson as Bella. It’s also been rumored that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475025/all-the-batman-villains-rumored-to-show-up-in-matt-reeves-dc-movie">Harvey Dent, Firefly and Mad Hatter could show up</a>.</p>
      <p>Behind the scenes, in addition to directing, Matt Reeves also co-wrote the script with Mattson Tomlin. Other contributors include <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477089/the-batman-just-added-some-rogue-one-talent">Greig Fraser as cinematographer</a>, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482268/the-batman-grabs-a-four-time-oscar-winner-to-make-sure-its-vfx-look-amazing">Dan Lemmon as VFX supervisor</a> and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482675/the-batman-now-has-a-composer-watch-matt-reeves-awkward-music-proposal">Michael Giacchino as composer</a>.</p>
