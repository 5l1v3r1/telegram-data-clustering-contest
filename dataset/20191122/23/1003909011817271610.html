      <h1>Darren Reynes receives a kidney — and new lease on life — from his soulmate</h1>

      <p>Darren Reynes didn’t know that he was meeting someone who would be his partner for life — and much more — when he ran into an old high school classmate at an Edmonton Bar during his university years.</p>
      <p>He and Michelle, now his wife, had attended East Glen High School together, but had never spoken to each other much in those teenaged years. As adults, however, they hit it off and years later during their marriage, they discovered that in addition to being a perfect pair, they were also a perfect match.</p>
      <p>Over the years, it became apparent Reynes — who had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes as a child — desperately needed a kidney transplant. They eventually found out that Michelle’s blood work revealed she could be his living donor.</p>
      <p>“It gives me goose bumps because that’s literally one-in-a-million kind of chances,” said Reynes, now 48.</p>
      <p>Reynes had initially planned to receive a kidney from his older brother, but his brother died in a car accident in the midst of final testing in early 2002 before a match could occur. So, Reynes continued with dialysis, hoping there’d be a deceased donor in the future who would be a match for him.</p>
      <p>His health, however, worsened. After three years in total on dialysis, Reynes told his wife that he was ready to stop fighting. He had experienced nearly every complication of the treatment imaginable, and didn’t think life was worth living as he awaited a transplant he felt would never come.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t have a life,” said Reynes, noting that grieving his brother compounded his medical struggles. “It felt like I was spiralling down a rabbit hole.”</p>
      <p>But his wife wouldn’t give up on him, and she encouraged him to swim each day to feel free and unencumbered —anything, really — and to explore more options for finding a donor.</p>
      <p>“We followed any glimmer of hope,” said Reynes, and that included looking for a living donor.</p>
      <p>The two found one when Michelle’s testing came back as a match in late 2003. The transplant in January 2004 went smoothly, and Reynes has had no rejections in almost 16 years.</p>
      <p>However, the underlying cause of Reynes’ kidney failure — a secondary complication of diabetes — would also require a pancreas transplant.</p>
      <p>The call for that transplant came just days after the birth of their second daughter in 2008. After multiple infections and more than a year of recovery, Reynes came through the other side of transplant surgery for a second time.</p>
      <p>“If I had to redo it all over again, I would — step by step, moment by moment to get to where I am today,” said Reynes.</p>
      <p>Now, he and his wife speak at pre-habilitation sessions and support other families considering living donation whenever they can. Patience, Reynes said, is often the hardest part of the process, but also the most rewarding.</p>
      <p>“Hope becomes invisible,” he said. “But if you can find it, and you have that support, those are probably the two most important things you can have.”</p>
