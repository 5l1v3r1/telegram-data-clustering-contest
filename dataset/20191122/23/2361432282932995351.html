      <h1>Elon Musk Unveils Tesla Cybertruck; It Didn't Go As Planned</h1>
      <h2>“Is this a prank?” asks confused Twitter user</h2>

      <p>Elon Musk hosted another high-profile Tesla unveiling on Thursday night — but it didn’t go exactly as planned.</p>
      <p>Musk, holding court at the company’s Tesla’s plant in Fremont, California, showed off the steel electric Cybertruck the company will start pumping out in 2022. Yet when it came to showing off how durable the truck is, things went a bit sideways: Instead of holding firm, the driver’s side window had a huge crack in it after Musk summoned someone on stage to throw a metal ball at it.</p>
      <p>“Oh my f—ing God,” Musk said. “Well, maybe that was a little too hard.”</p>

      <p>The second attempt didn’t go much better, leaving another huge gash in the left-side passenger window.</p>
      <p>“It didn’t go through,” Musk said, while chuckling. The crowd let out some uneasy laughs as well.</p>
      <p>It was that kind of night. Tesla, Musk and especially the triangular, “Blade Runner”-inspired Cybertruck — expected to cost nearly $40,000 on the low end when it debuts — were ridiculed immediately on Twitter.</p>
      <p>References to Homer Simpson’s failed car design from Season 2 of “The Simpsons” and Musk’s weed puff on Joe Rogan’s show last year were mentioned.</p>

      <p>Wall Street wasn’t that forgiving, either. Tesla’s stock price dropped more than 6% in early-morning trading on Friday, hitting $330.67 per share. On the year, the company is still up about 20 points.</p>
