      <p>A conjunction has no function in “Wheel of Fortune.”</p>
      <p>One poor contestant on Thursday night’s show ended up losing the game over a technicality when she made a minor mistake solving the crossword puzzle challenge. Kristen Shaw solved the puzzle, but added the word “and” when listing the words in the solution.</p>
      <p>“Right, football, left and Sally,” she answered, using the conjunction “and” as part of her answer, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/wheel-of-fortune-fans-call-for-rule-change-after-technicality-costs-contestant-a-win/ar-BBX9hwY">reports Yahoo</a>.</p>
      <p>The correct answer? “Right,” “football,” “left,” “Sally.”</p>
      <p>“Most times I caution people not to add anything, and you maybe didn’t even hear yourself say it but you threw an ‘and’ in there with the last thing and we have to go by the rules,” <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/08/pat-sajak-has-emergency-surgery-vanna-white-to-host-wheel-of-fortune-in-his-absence/">host Pat Sajak</a> explained.</p>
      <p>Shaw’s tiny mistake ended up being a big loss: She was denied her $1,950 in winnings as well as an $8,000 trip to Nashville. Another contestant, Bryan Idler, ended up winning.</p>
      <p>“Our long-standing rule is that in order to have a correct puzzle solve, a contestant must say only what is on the board without adding words,” a spokesperson for the show <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/wheel-of-fortune-rule-change">told Fox News</a>. “Contestants are thoroughly briefed prior to the show, and Pat often reminds them of this rule when solving a puzzle in this particular category.”</p>
      <p>However, “Wheel of Fortune” fans are calling for the show to ditch the technicality.</p>
      <p>“Utterly ridiculous that you didn’t give credit to Kristen for the ___ field puzzle because she said ‘and’ before the last word of the list. Functionally no different from the pauses you allow. You know she knew the puzzle @WheelofFortune Not cool,” <a href="https://twitter.com/NeuroVixen/status/1197668748762767362">one fan tweeted</a>.</p>
      <p>“They can easily change the rule to allow ‘and’ as part of your verbal answer. Conjunctions are natural parts of speech [and] should be ok for crosswords,” <a href="https://twitter.com/drewbreess/status/1197679287089926145">chimed in another</a>.</p>
