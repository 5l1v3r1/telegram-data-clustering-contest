      <p>Could <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michael-jackson/">Michael Jackson</a> be the latest musician whose career gets turned into a movie?</p>
      <p>It looks like this might just be happening, as Bohemian Rhapsody producer Graham King has reportedly secured the rights to make a biopic about the life of the late singer.</p>
      <p>The singer’s estate is said to have given Graham the green light to produce the film, according to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/michael-jackson-movie-bohemian-rhapsody-producer-john-logan-graham-king-1202792922/">Deadline</a>, with Oscar-nominated writer John Logan also reportedly set to write the project.</p>
      <p>The biopic will reportedly take a look at the life and rise to stardom of the King Of Pop, from becoming a child star in the Jackson Five, to his death in June 2009.</p>
      <p>As well as looking at the successes of his career, the biopic is also said to take a look at the controversy Michael faced throughout his life, and even in his death.</p>

      <p>The film will reportedly address the allegations of child sexual abuse that Michael faced, his subsequent trial and acquittal in 2005, and the more recent allegations made in HBO’s Leaving Neverland documentary earlier this year.</p>

      <p>As of April 2019, the film has made nearly $1 billion (£760 million) and has taken in box office receipts of over $900 (£687 million) around the world.</p>
      <p>The film also won a total of four Oscars at the 91<sup>st</sup> Academy Awards, including <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/02/25/rami-malek-publicly-declares-love-lucy-boyton-wins-best-actor-oscar-bohemian-rhapsody-8729439/">Best Actor for the film’s leading star, Rami Malek</a>, who portrayed Queen frontman Freddie Mercury.</p>
