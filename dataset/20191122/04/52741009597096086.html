      <p>OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau seems open to a proposal from Vancouver to provide millions of dollars in funding for a safe supply of opioids to reduce overdose deaths, Mayor Kennedy Stewart said after meeting Trudeau on Parliament Hill on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The city's health agency has applied for $6 million from Health Canada to allow for the safe distribution of diamorphine — a narcotic painkiller more commonly known as heroin.</p>
      <p>Stewart said he found it encouraging that Trudeau didn't shut the door to the idea when the two met.</p>
      <p>"(Trudeau said) that he wants to work together ... and open to having a conversation and then looking to us to lead, with health-care professionals, to try and figure out the best solutions to these problems," he said after the meeting wrapped up. "So I'm very encouraged by that and grateful."</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister's Office echoed that sentiment in a statement Thursday, saying all three levels of government are working together "to help save lives."</p>
      <p>Stewart said, one average, one person dies every day from an opioid overdose in Vancouver, where residents are calling for more urgent action.</p>
      <p>The mayor said he was also pleased to learn Patty Hajdu is the new health minister, because she has experience with harm-reduction strategies. The Liberal MP spent years working on drug awareness in her hometown of Thunder Bay, Ont., and was executive director of an emergency shelter there.</p>
      <p>Hajdu said later that while she has not yet seen Vancouver's proposal, she looks forward to sitting down with Stewart Friday.</p>
      <p>"I think it's really important that we work with local and municipal leaders on solutions that really make sense for their communities," she said.</p>
      <p>"I'm looking for good solutions on the opiate crisis," she said.</p>
      <p>Vancouver was the first jurisdiction in Canada to open a legally sanctioned supervised injection site in the early 2000s and Stewart says he wants to keep exploring other innovative ways to solve its deadly opioid crisis.</p>
      <p>"We're in a minority-government situation and there's windows to co-operate, come together, build things that Canadians want," said Stewart, who was a New Democrat MP until he resigned to run for mayor last year.</p>
      <p>"I want to make sure this window doesn't close before we deliver on these key priorities."</p>
