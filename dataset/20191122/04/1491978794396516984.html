      <p>Australia and Melbourne Renegades all-rounder Sophie Molineux is the latest cricketer to take a break from the sport to focus on her mental health. The Renegades announced on Friday that Molineux would miss this weekend’s WBBL derby clash with the Melbourne Stars in Ballarat.</p>
      <p>Elite men’s players <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/31/glenn-maxwell-to-take-break-from-cricket-due-to-mental-health-issues">Glenn Maxwell</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/14/will-pucovski-pulls-out-of-test-contention-and-requests-mental-wellbeing-break">Will Pucovski</a> and Nic Maddinson have also recently stepped away from the sport for mental health reasons. Renegades coach Tim Coyle said Molineux, 21, had the club’s full support.</p>
      <p>“Sophie knows her teammates and the Renegades coaches and support staff are always there for her,” Coyle said. “We’ll give Sophie the time, space and any support she needs.”</p>
      <p>Molineux made her Test debut this year in Australia’s victorious Ashes campaign in England. She will also continue working with Pip Inge, the Australia women’s team doctor.</p>
      <p>“Sophie has made the decision to take a break from cricket and we are providing her with the support she needs,” Inge said. “The welfare of our players is a priority and we are proud of the brave decision by Sophie to step away from the game.”</p>
      <p>Makinley Blows has been brought into the Renegades squad for this weekend’s match. The Renegades currently sit fifth on the WBBL table with four matches of the regular season remaining.</p>
