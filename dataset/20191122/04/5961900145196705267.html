      <h1>Holy Shit, Dolly Parton Says She Recently Ran Into *The* Jolene</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:28:33+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:28</time> by <a rel="author">By David Adams</a></address>
      <p><b>Dolly Parton</b> destroyed a woman’s life in 1974. In two minutes and forty two seconds, <i>Jolene</i> turned an entire generation of music fans against a husband-stealing jezebel, and the tune’s enduring power proves you should never, <i>ever</i> cross one of the 20th century’s most capable songwriters.</p>
      <p>That’s a roundabout way of saying that Parton <i>won, </i>in the long-run. There was no reason for her to ever reference Jolene outside of song ever again, given the fact she and husband <b>Carl Dean</b> are still together.</p>
      <p>But nearly fifty years after first committing Jolene to record, Parton decided to unleash one last insult, a final “suck my ass!” to the most famous romantic enemy in pop music history.</p>
      <p>Taking to<i> The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</i>, Parton said she actually saw the real-world Jolene not long ago, and claimed “she’s not so hot now.”</p>

      <p>At this point, it doesn’t even matter if the anecdote is true – and there’s very little chance Parton, a world-famous star, would cross paths with her former bank teller. All that matters is Jolene was, is, and will always be our enemy.</p>
