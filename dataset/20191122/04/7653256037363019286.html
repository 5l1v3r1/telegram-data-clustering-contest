      <p>New Delhi: With the Supreme Court paving the way for a Ram temple in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ayodhya">Ayodhya</a>, the Uttar Pradesh government is working overtime on several related projects that it aims to put in place before the temple comes up by 2023.</p>
      <p>A 100-acre ‘Eye Theme Park’ is being built with a symbolic <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ram-Setu">Ram Setu</a> or bridge to take visitors across a man-made lake from ‘Shabri Garden’ to ‘Ashok Vatika’, an international museum on Lord Ram’s life is set to be unveiled, nearly Rs 640 crore has been released to fast-track an airport and Lord Ram’s statue and Rs 600 crore is being spent on cleaning the Saryu river as part of the ongoing revamp of the holy city.</p>
      <p>“We are aiming for the first commercial flight to land at Sri Ram Airport in Ayodhya next year. Out of the Rs 640 crore earmarked for the land acquisition for the project, Rs 526 crore has already been released,” a senior Uttar Pradesh government official told ET.</p>
      <p>He said another Rs 227 crore has been released out of the estimated Rs 647 crore land acquisition and technical study cost of the 251-metre tall Ram statue project. “We are aiming for foundation laying ceremony of the statue on Ram Navami (April 2, 2020),” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>The statue project will get a corporate social responsibility (CSR) account to make it easier to get funds for construction.</p>
      <p>Another big-ticket project that will offer a simulated view of the Ramayana is the country’s biggest theme park coming up in Ayodhya over 100 acres and could be opened to public in 2020. Here, visuals of both Ayodhya and Lanka will be visible with a <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Shabri-Garden">Shabri Garden</a> coming up on one side with ber trees to depict a well-known chapter in the Ramayana when Lord Ram ate fruits offered by a tribal woman.</p>
      <p>Alongside, a mythical Ram Setu will be built upon a man-made lake with an <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ashok-Vatika">Ashok Vatika</a> on the other side, where Sita was kept hostage by Ravana in Lanka. This Eye Theme Park will have four zones, as per officials. It will be complemented by an International Ram Katha museum featuring depictions from Lord Ram’s life – both the projects will open in 2020.</p>
      <p>Another big-ticket project nearing completion is the Bhajan Sandhya Sthal for holding prayers and religious events in Ayodhya and expansion of the existing Ram Katha Park. A Ram Lila academy is also being conceptualised along with online streaming of Ram Lila held in Ayodhya. Officials also speak of the recently-opened Raja Dashratha Medical College in Ayodhya in the name of Lord Ram’s father.</p>
      <p>A digital museum and an interpretation centre is planned to be housed underneath the giant Ram statue planned in Ayodhya. A lesser-known but significant project being implemented in and around Ayodhya is the Saryu River National Programme at a cost of Rs 1,385 crore to clean the holy river. The UP government released Rs 600 crore for this project too on October 4.</p>
      <p>Besides, the ‘Ayodhya Dham’ railway station, revamped at a cost of Rs 100 crore, will be unveiled early next year. Its entry gate has been shaped like a temple.</p>
