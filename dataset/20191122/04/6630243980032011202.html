      <p>Police in South Africa on Thursday arrested and charged a senior lawmaker from the country’s ruling African National Congress party, over corruption.</p>
      <p>Bongani Bongo, a former state security minister under former president Jacob Zuma, is accused of interfering with an inquiry into corruption at state power utility Eskom, police spokesman Hangwani Mulaudzi told Reuters.</p>
      <p>Bongo allegedly asked the inquiry’s evidence leader to go on sick leave in 2017 to frustrate its progress, Mulaudzi said.</p>
      <p>Bongo, who was not immediately available for comment, chairs parliament’s portfolio committee on home affairs.</p>
      <p>He appeared in court in Cape Town and was released on bail of 5,000 rand ($338.70), Mulaudzi said, adding Bongo was due back in court on Jan. 31.</p>
      <p>Should this high-profile trial lead to a conviction, it might lend credence to president Cyril Ramaphosa’s fight against corruption.</p>
