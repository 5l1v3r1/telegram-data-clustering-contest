      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Record Reporter</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sex-crime">serial rapist</a> has been jailed for the vile treatment of two women who suffered “horrendous behaviour” at the hands of the brute.</p>
      <p>Gerard Porteous, 59, was locked up for a minimum of six years after his brave victims came forward to report him.</p>
      <p>One of the women endured sustained attacks for six years.</p>
      <p>Porteous, from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paisley">Paisley</a>, has a shameful list of convictions for abuse carried out over more than three decades.</p>
      <p>In 2016 he was sentenced to 12 years in prison for sexual offences involving three women in Airdrie and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/airdrie">Paisley</a> between 1994 and 2013.</p>
      <p>He was convicted of rape, assault and indecent assault in 2018 for repeatedly abusing two women in the 80s and 90s.</p>
      <p>Yesterday he was sentenced at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">High Court in Glasgow</a> where he was told he will only be released from prison on license as he was given an Order for Lifelong Restriction.</p>
      <p>This means Porteous could be kept in jail for the rest of his life if it is determined that he still poses a high risk to the public.</p>

      <p>Police Scotland praised the courage of his victims who they said would be “deeply affected” for the rest of their lives.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Iain Renfrew from Police Scotland's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">Domestic Abuse Task Force</a> said: “Gerard Porteous carried out a six year campaign of abuse towards two woman, which will have no doubt left them deeply affected by the experience for the rest of their lives.</p>
      <p>“I must thank these women for having the strength to come forward and report the abuse they endured, and for the courage they have shown throughout the investigation.</p>
      <p>“I hope today’s outcome gives them some sort of closure and sends a clear message to anyone who thinks it is acceptable to treat people in this way. </p>

      <p>“Gerard Porteous is a serial domestic abuser whose offending behaviour spans 32 years. He must now face the consequences of his horrendous behaviour for the rest of his life.</p>
      <p>“Police Scotland is committed to tackling domestic abuse and no one should ever feel they are alone or in a position of fear.</p>
      <p>“I would encourage anyone to report domestic abuse in any form, as all reports will be thoroughly investigated. We will continue to work with partner agencies to ensure victims of domestic abuse are supported and to ensure their safety and wellbeing.”</p>
