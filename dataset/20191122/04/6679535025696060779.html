      <h1>Two lynched in West Bengal over suspicion of cattle theft, 13 arrested</h1>

      <p>Thirteen persons have been arrested in West Bengal’s  Cooch Behar district for their alleged involvement in the lynching of two youths, police said on November 22. The victims were accused of stealing cattle.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred in the early hours of November 21 when the deceased — identified as Bablu Das and Rabiul Islam — were intercepted by a group of locals at in Ketarhat of Putimary-Phuleshwari gram panchayat area under Cooch Behar 1 administrative block. The two were dragged out of their vehicle and were beaten up. The vehicle was also set on fire. The accused were produced before a city court which remanded them to a five-day police custody. Raids are on to arrest more people involved in the crime, police said. </p>
      <p>“The police reached the spot in half an hour and rescued the two. They were taken to Cooch Behar Medical College and Hospital where they succumbed to the injuries on Thursday (November 21) afternoon,”  Cooch Behar police superintendent Santosh Nimbalkar told <i>The Hindu</i> over telephone.</p>
      <p>The SP said that the vehicle the two victims were travelling had no number plate and they were carrying two cows. Mr. Nimbalkar said both the victims had been involved in cases of theft in the past and one of them was released from prison a few months ago.</p>
      <p>Alina Yasmin, pradhan of the Putimary-Phuleshwari gram panchayat, said that she came to know about the incident in the early hours of  November 21. “I cannot say who are involved because I wasn’t there. But I have heard that some local people have been arrested.  I would urge the police to spare the innocent,” Ms. Yasmin said. Both the victims are from Mathbhanga in the same district. Cooch Behar borders with Bangladesh and there have been instances of smuggling cattle from India into Bangladesh. </p>
      <p>Over the past two days the markets and shops near the place have remained closed and many people have fled  their home fearing police action.</p>
      <p>Over the past few years incidents of lynching over cattle theft have been reported in different parts of the State, both in north Bengal and the south.  The West Bengal Legislative Assembly in August 2019 passed The <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/west-bengal-passes-bill-against-lynching/article29302545.ece">West Bengal (Prevention of Lynching) Bill, 2019</a> which has maximum punishment of death sentence for those convicted. The legislation which is awaiting assent of the Governor also has provisions of appointment of “nodal officers” who shall “monitor and coordinate prevention of lynching”.</p>
