      <h1>Plea In Madras HC Seeks CBI Investigation In IIT-Madras Student Suicide Case</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:45:47+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:45</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The Tamil Nadu National Students' Union of India filed a petition in the Madras High Court on Thursday seeking transfer of investigation into the suicide of a girl student of IIT-Madras to the CBI.</p>
      <p>The prestigious institute has been rocked by protests after <b>Fathima Lathee</b>f, a first year humanities student, committed suicide in its hostel on November 9. Her Kerala-based family has allege a senior faculty was responsible for her taking the extreme step.</p>
      <p>Noting that the investigation was transferred to Central Crime Branch, the petitioner claimed that since April 2018 till November 2019, in total five students committed suicide in the college campus.</p>
      <p>Alleging that the institution has not taken any effective redressal steps despite multiple incidents of suicide by students, the petitioner said it has become a mystery and the students wing has no faith in the state police.</p>
      <p>Hence, it was necessary to transfer the case to the CBI, it said.</p>
      <p>The petitioner said that though a special team appointed by the police was conducting proper investigation, it would lack credibility since the issue has raised several doubts among the public.</p>
      <p>Until an independent agency like the CBI investigates the matter, the truth would never come out, it added.</p>
