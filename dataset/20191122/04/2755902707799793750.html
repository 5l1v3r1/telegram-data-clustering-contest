      <p>The cabinet has explained that they approved the renaming of roads, places and Government buildings in Harare, Bulawayo and other towns across the country, as way to try and foster unity, while reflecting on the country’s history and identity.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/new-names-for-streets-buildings/">This was said by Acting Minister of Information,</a> Publicity and Broadcasting Services, Mangaliso Ndlovu, while addressing journalists after yesterday’s Cabinet meeting.</p>
      <aside>“Cabinet noted that through the process of naming, every community or society defines its identity and culture, tells its history, and espouses its values, beliefs, norms and world-view,” he said.<br/>“Naming is also a social engagement tool that fosters understanding, peace and unity in diversity.”</aside>
      <p>Enterprise Road was <a href="https://iharare.com/latestharare-roads-renamed/">notably named after President Emmerson Mnangagwa.</a></p>
