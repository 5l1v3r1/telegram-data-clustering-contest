      <p>THE Executive Director of Jaiz Charity and Development Foundation, Dr Abdullahi Shuaib, has urged students to excel in their studies.</p>
      <p>He said excelling in their academic would open further opportunities for them.</p>
      <p>Dr Shuaib spoke at the disbursement of N4 million Zakat funds to 108 beneficiaries in Lagos.</p>
      <p>At the event in Beleke Smith Memorial Mosque Hall, Surulere, students of higher institutions in Lagos went home with cheques.</p>
      <p>The Jaiz foundation’s chief said education support got the highest percentage of the Zakat funds.</p>
      <p>Shuaib said education was the best legacy to bequeath to youths, especially those from homes struggling to meet their academic financial demands.</p>
      <p>The foundation, he said, was ready to assist students that excel to further their studies.</p>
      <p>“Allah has solved one of their challenges by providing this unique opportunity for them. So, they should dedicate their time to study hard and come out with good grades. This will earn them further opportunities,” he said.</p>
      <p>According to him, 54 per cent of the beneficiaries fell under the category of education support, 32 per cent for economic empowerment, while those with health challenges took the remaining 14 per cent.</p>
      <p>He said: “From our studies over the years, more than 50 per cent of people that benefitted from the health challenge funds diverted the money for sustenance, believing that God will take care of their health…</p>
      <p>“This happens because the foundation has little control over the monitoring aspect but at the point of doing the assessment, we do realise that the money giving out to take care of their health was diverted to other things.</p>
      <p>“Likewise on economic empowerment, the foundation has placed emphasis on buying equipment for beneficiaries and reducing the number of beneficiaries that access cash. We believe the equipment will generate income for them.”</p>
      <p>Grand Mufti of Conference of Islamic Organisations (CIO) Sheikh Dhikrullah Shafi’i said Zakat was an essential component of Islamic economic system, which could eradicate poverty, if properly administered.</p>
      <p>He said government’s participation in Zakat collection would make impact in the society.</p>
      <p>“The reason why some Muslims are still enmeshed in poverty despite high proceeds of Zakat is due to non-involvement of the government…’’ the cleric said.</p>
      <p>Chief Imam of Adangba Central Mosque Sheikh Abdurahman Adangba advised that a template be put in place to prevent Zakat beneficiaries collecting from more than one organisation.</p>
      <p>“This globally accepted template will serve as a medium to disburse and collect Zakat. If we start using the template, it will resist the situation whereby people collect Zakat from different organizations,” he said.</p>
