      <p>THE Lagos State government has urged residents of Ojodu Local Council Development (LCDA) to desilt drains to prevent flooding and other hazards.</p>
      <p>During a visit to Adebowale Street in Ojodu LCDA to evacuate silt from drains, Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs Mrs. Yetunde Arobieke monitored the evacuation.</p>
      <p>She urged residents to support the government in tackling flooding and other environmental hazards.</p>
      <p>According to the her, the visit was part of efforts to increase awareness on the policy on environment.</p>
      <p>While sensitising residents on how to manage waste and keep their environment neat, the commissioner urged them to always keep their environment clean</p>
      <p>“Water and asphalt are enemies; each time the drainage gets filled with refuse, flood extends to the main road, thereby washing off the asphalt and weakening the road.</p>

      <p>‘’Since good roads are essential amenity, which we all can’t do without, it has become important for you and I to play our part. I urge the people, traders and residents generally, to clear their surrounding and desilt the drainage close to them as at when due. When the refuse is properly packed, you should then call on the local council to cart it away,” Arobieke said.</p>
      <p>According to her, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has ordered clearing of primary and secondary drains.</p>
      <p>She urged residents to properly dispose their refuse, adding that plastic bottles, nylon, glass bottles, cans and perishable items should be bagged separately.</p>
      <p>A trader, Peter Ebirin hailed government for the initiative and promise to always desilt the drain.</p>
      <p>“I thank Ojodu LCDA for what they are doing. It shows the administration is working. Henceforth, I will ensure we desilt our drainage,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Ola Adebowale promised to always keep the drainage clean and promise to encourage other neighbours to desilt their drains.</p>
      <p>“I really appreciate what the government is doing to ensure we have a safe environment. I will follow the instruction given to us and …disseminate the information to other residents to ensure our environment is always clean.”</p>
