      <p>These are exciting times for Niamh Mulcahy.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, she collected a Liberty Insurance Camogie All-Star — her first after 15 years of breaking scoring records with Limerick.</p>
      <p>That award, in turn, has led to this week’s trip to New York where she will play alongside the best and brightest talents the sport has to offer.</p>
      <p>The celebrations won’t end there, with Mulcahy set to marry Clare football legend Gary Brennan next month.</p>
      <p>Mulcahy though is keen to share the glory of that All-Star statuette: “Getting the All-Star has probably made other people a lot more happy than it has made me.</p>
      <p>“My parents are delighted, club managers and trainers over the years, coaches and managers with Limerick over the years from underage through to senior, “ said Mulcahy who was Young Player of the Year in 2007.</p>
      <p>But Mulcahy admits that there is one bonus of being an All-Star winner this weekend.</p>
      <p>“I was fortunate enough to get to go to Madrid two years ago when there were a lot of double All-Stars with Cork and Kilkenny.</p>
      <blockquote>It’s probably a bit nicer this year, having an award, you don’t feel as much as a fraud going!</blockquote>
      <p>“It’s brilliant and Gaelic Park is synonymous with GAA outside of Ireland. I’ve relations in New York that are involved and they’re looking forward to the game as well.”</p>
      <p>Another member of the travelling party, Kilkenny’s Edwina Keane got married last weekend. And Mulcahy admits she is relishing her own big day.</p>
      <p>“Once Gary is there to meet me at the altar, it’s all done now,” she says with a smile.</p>
