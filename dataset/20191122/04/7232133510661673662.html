      <p>The long awaited IPO from Chinese Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer Canaan Inc kicked off yesterday. The $90 million public offering was a little underwhelming considering previous valuations and the firm ended its first day trading flat.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Mining Shares Back at $9</h3>
      <p>This week Chinese mining giant Canaan Inc. completed its initial public offering in the US for $90 million. The figure sounds impressive for the first time a Chinese company based on Bitcoin has been listed, however it is way less than the original valuation of $400 million in October.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg reported that the mining hardware manufacturer sold 10 million American Depository Shares (ADS) for $9 apiece on Wednesday. An ADS is a USD denominated equity share of a foreign-based company available for purchase on an American stock exchange.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/66013/Crypto-mining-company-Canaan-sets-terms-for-%24100-million-US-IPO">official announcement</a> last week, the Hangzhou based firm planned to raise $100 million by offering 10 million shares which were offered between $9 and $11 according to filings with the SEC.</p>
      <p>Canaan also lost its lead underwriter, Credit Suisse Group, before the IPO was launched leaving Citi, China Renaissance, and CMB International Capital to run the books.</p>
      <p>Three Arrows Capital CEO Su Zhu reported that the shares actually opened at $13 but fell back to $9 by the end of trading.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-21/bitcoin-mining-company-canaan-raises-90-million-in-u-s-ipo">Bloomberg</a> added that the stock ended the day flat at a penny under, trading at $8.99. It added that there was a spike of around 44% which would have pumped prices to $13 initially. There was also a dip with the intraday low hitting $8.21 according to the Nasdaq. Friday’s trading will be interesting to watch, especially considering what is happening to Bitcoin prices at the moment.</p>

      <h3>Bearish Crypto Sentiment</h3>
      <p>The lackluster first day’s trading could be a signal of fading interest in Bitcoin in general. So far this week the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/21/bitcoin-on-life-support-as-analysts-target-move-to-sub-7000/">digital asset has dumped</a> 11% as crypto markets shed billions.</p>
      <p>The bears are back in play and general sentiment has entered the red zone with analysts now eyeing a short term bottom of around $6,000.</p>
      <p>Even <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/21/bitcoin-twitter-engagement-tumbles-to-two-year-lows-as-sentiment-turns-bearish/">twitter engagement has fallen</a> off as the number of Bitcoin related tweets hits a two year low. There has also been a lot of talk of miner capitulation so the timing of Canaan’s listing could not have been worse.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing BTC had collapsed to $7,650 marking a loss of 4.5% on the day. Total market capitalization has shrunk by over $10 billion in 24 hours and is plunging towards the psychological $200 billion barrier. A fall through this could see a return to crypto winter levels at the end of last year as all this year’s gains get wiped out.</p>
      <p>It will be interesting to follow Friday trading for CAN which is likely also to mimic crypto sentiment and turn south, below its opening price.</p>
