      <p>WA Police are investigating another burglary on a Perth gun store, which was described as “well-planned” and “extensively researched”.</p>
      <p>Police say they believe about 100 weapons, consisting primarily of handguns and some long-barrelled firearms, were stolen overnight from Claremont Firearms, on Erceg Road in Yangebup.</p>
      <p>Just after 11.30pm last night, the owner of the store became aware of an alarm activation.</p>
      <p>Police discovered the offenders had gained access by cutting through the wall of a neighbouring premises on Cutting Way.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Peter Foley said the culprits have been well-organised.</p>
      <p>“All the firearms were contained in the strong or the safe room,” he said.</p>
      <p>“They’ve taken extreme measures.</p>
      <p>“It’s taken some time to do the cutting, they would have been there for some time.”</p>

      <p>Detectives are also seeking information on a stolen white Toyota Hilux, registration 1GPM 241.</p>
      <p>The car was stolen from Cockburn Central on Monday, November 11 and was located burnt out in North Lake, about 7km from the store, earlier today.</p>

      <p>Detectives would like to hear from anyone who saw this vehicle, or who noticed a vehicle of similar description attend any neighbouring residences since 11 November.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information or dash-cam vision regarding this burglary, or who saw or heard anything suspicious in the Erceg Road and Cutting Way area between Wednesday and the early hours of this morning, are asked to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or report the information online at <a href="https://www.crimestopperswa.com.au/">crimestopperswa.com.au.</a></p>
      <p>Police have also released CCTV footage near the burglary.</p>

      <p>Det-Insp Foley said they had committed “very extensive” resources towards the investigation, including around 80-100 officers.</p>
      <p>“We don’t know how many or who has committed this offence,” he said.</p>
      <p>“This investigation commenced at about midnight last night and has been continuous since then.</p>
      <p>“The recovery of the stolen firearms is a major priority of WA Police Force.</p>
      <p>“Firearms, particularly handguns, present a real risk to the community, and it is fair to say the intended destination of the stolen firearms is the black market, and into the hands of criminals.”</p>
      <p>It is the second case of theft from a gun store this year, after Barry &amp; Sons Firearms in Beckenham was robbed in September.</p>
      <p>It was the second time Barry &amp; Sons had been hit by thieves, following another robbery in 2017.</p>
      <p>Det-Insp Foley quashed links between this burglary and the similar incident at Barry &amp; Sons Firearms.</p>
      <p>“We cannot link the two offences and the method is very different,” he said.</p>
      <p>A 23-year-old man was charged over this year’s theft from Barry &amp; Sons, and pleaded guilty to the theft last month.</p>
      <p>Claremont Firearms describes itself online as Perth’s ‘firearm superstore’, and stocks handguns, sniper rifles and shotguns.</p>
