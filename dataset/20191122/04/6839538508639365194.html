      <p>A tip off from Australian authorities has resulted in one of the biggest seizures of MDMA across two countries, worth more than $300 million.</p>
      <p>Australian police contacted their Dutch counterparts in January, sparking a joint operation that has led to the breakdown of a drug syndicate believed to have supplied the global market.</p>
      <p>It also prevented 700kg of crystalline MDMA from reaching Brisbane and potentially ending up in the bellies of high school leavers on the Gold Coast.</p>
      <p>Australian Federal Police and Queensland police worked with officers in The Netherlands and Belgium to intercept the huge haul in the Dutch city of Rotterdam in late August.</p>
      <p>Raids were carried out by Dutch authorities at 15 locations in those two countries earlier this month, uncovering drug labs disguised to look like barns from the outside.</p>
      <p>Concealed within fake walls, floors and ceilings inside were hundreds of kilos of hard and liquid drugs and other drug paraphernalia.</p>
      <p>In all, 850kg of crystalline MDMA was seized, along with 548 litres of MDMA oil and 400 litres of precursor chemicals.</p>
      <p>That's enough to make 15 million MDMA pills with a street value of more than $300 million.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Australia is a primary market in the global drug trade because Australians are willing to pay a high price for substances that cost a mere fraction elsewhere.</p>
      <p>An MDMA pill that costs 20 cents in Amsterdam will fetch $20 on Australian streets.</p>
      <p>Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has praised the efforts of Australian and Dutch authorities, saying their results would be a relief to parents whose kids could well have taken the drugs had they not been seized.</p>
      <p>"Those people who tell you that we are losing the fight and the war against drugs don't know what they are talking about," he told reporters in Brisbane on Friday.</p>
      <p>"We are pushing back on the scourge of serious and organised crime, and as we know the bikies in this country are the biggest distributors, importers, manufacturers of drugs."</p>
      <p>Andy Kraag, the assistant commissioner of the Dutch National Criminal Investigation Division, said the two countries took their time to set a trap to catch individuals involved in the supply and demand.</p>
      <p>"We want to target the complete chain, that's why it took us up a to a year," he said.</p>
      <p>It brought down a major criminal network Mr Kraag says has previously supplied the global market.</p>
      <p>"The joint operation allowed us to close down on these criminals and fully expose and break down this network," he added.</p>
      <p>Police have charged 11 people including a 48-year-old woman from Bass Hill in Sydney.</p>
      <p>She has been extradited to Brisbane accused of possessing a commercial quantity of border controlled drugs - a charge that could see her jailed for life.</p>
      <p>The arrests also include two Dutch men alleged to be key players in the drug ring, a 58-year-old arrested in Belgium and a 37-year-old nabbed in The Netherlands.</p>
      <p>The investigation by Dutch authorities is ongoing.</p>
