      <h1>Labour manifesto offers hope but is leader Corbyn party's Achilles' heel?</h1>
      <h2>Ambitious plans have 'social justice stamped on every page'.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:30:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Record View, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/record-view/</a></address>
      <p>After Labour’s manifesto launch yesterday no one can be left in any doubt about where the party stands in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/gordon-brown-says-only-labour-20923791">political landscape</a>.</p>
      <p>A £10 living wage, the end of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/over-4000-east-kilbride-residents-20922492">Universal Credit</a>, the reform of welfare, the rebuilding of the NHS, a massive house-building programme, all these and more are policy pledges we would expect and welcome from the Labour party.</p>
      <p>The UK is on its knees after <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/opinion/appalling-legacy-austerity-should-make-20884686">a decade of Tory and, let’s not forget, Lib Dem austerity</a>. A Labour government in Westminster would provide the spark that would lift people out of poverty.</p>

      <p>But Jeremy Corbyn’s bus does not stop in the middle ground. His government would go further with mass re-nationalisation, a reversal of the Thatcher revolution.</p>
      <p>Plans like nationalising broadband aren’t harum scarum ideas, though they are bold.</p>
      <p>When the £146 million contract to provide superfast broadband to the Scottish Highlands was issued there was only one bidder left - BT. Two out of three regional contracts for broadband provision in Scotland have only one bidder, guess who?</p>
      <p>Why allow a virtual private monopoly when the state could provide an essential service.</p>
      <p>Making the polluters pay for a green economy that must come is radical too, and matches the wildfire passion of the school strikers and the demands of a sick environment.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/john-mcdonnell-backtracks-saying-labour-20563643">John McDonnell</a> has it right, this is not a tax on Aberdeen, it is a tax for Aberdeen and to transition away from big oil and the multinationals that have cleaned out the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/40-years-of-north-sea-oil-1072080">North Sea</a> and made massive profits in the process.</p>
      <p>On the big questions, Brexit and Scottish independence, Corbyn is isolated in the middle, trying to appease both sides of the divide. That, and his own leadership abilities, are Labour’s weakness.</p>
      <p>But Labour is a movement, not one man, and its manifesto has big strengths, big ambitions, and has social justice stamped on every page. When the alternative is a bleak, Etonian Brexit, this is lightning bolt of hope.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-tennis-star-andy-murray-20870174">Andy Murray</a>’s popularity is as much to do with his off court conduct as it is from his world class game.</p>
      <p>His staunch support for women’s rights has been an inspiration, as is his charitable work.</p>
      <p>A new documentary will shed new light on this extraordinary athlete by charting his path back to fitness from career-theatening hip operations.</p>
      <p>It will show how Andy’s injury nightmare put a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/andy-murray-reveals-marriage-suffered-20931199">strain on his relationship with his loved ones</a>.</p>
      <p>In an interview, he has also said his spell on the sidelines has helped him understand his priorities in life.</p>
      <p>When Andy retires - hopefully not for a number of years - we are certain his new life will be as successful as his tennis playing days.</p>
