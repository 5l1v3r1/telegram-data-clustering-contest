      <p>Moree Toastmasters are punching above their weight with local members taking out the area contest for all four speech competitions this year.</p>
      <p>Vice president education <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/4228327/annettes-public-speaking-success/">Annette Hadley</a> won the evaluation contest, while Wendy Baldwin took out all three other contests - table topics, humorous and international.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Annette was not able to attend the next level of competition due to her AFL commitments.</p>
      <p>However, at the district contest (covering the whole North West and New England) Moree's Wendy Baldwin went on to win the 'table topics' competition and the coveted international speech competition.</p>
      <p>"This is a great achievement for our small club and it proves that what we lack in size we make up for in quality," immediate past president Lila Fisher said.</p>

      <p>Wendy followed up her area win with a third place in the district level contest in Sydney for the International Speech Competition.</p>
      <p>"This is a mighty effort as the speakers at the district level are vying for a trip to the world competition, and Wendy was competing with some professional speakers who use Toastmasters to practice their skills," Ms Fisher said.</p>
      <p>"Wendy's Speech was focused on the hardships and trials of living with a prolonged drought and was an eye opener to many of the city audience who didn't realise that the drought was still going.</p>
      <p>"While on stage, Wendy had the opportunity to promote Moree. She encouraged everyone to come here and see what the real country is like. She did this with enthusiasm and passion that resulted in her working as a travel agent while at the Toastmasters conference."</p>
      <p>Ms Fisher said Wendy's success highlights the unique quality of all Toastmasters clubs, which cater for both good speakers who want to become great orators and those who want to learn the skills, tricks and tips to becoming confident, capable speakers.</p>
      <p>Toastmasters International has proven methods to encourage and improve everyone's public speaking skills - a wonderful skill for work, job seeking, weddings and social functions and other such events.</p>
      <p>Toastmasters knows that not everyone has the confidence to speak to a group but everyone has a story to tell. Toastmaster members learn to become confident speakers through a series of simple speeches and personal feedback.</p>
      <p>"The Moree Toastmaster's other great asset is our relaxed friendly atmosphere, which is the envy of our neighbours," Ms Fisher said.</p>
      <p>"Moree Toastmasters is one of the best places to learn and grow your public speaking skills as you are learning amongst friends.</p>
      <p>"If you are already a confident speaker, like our contest winners then Toastmasters allows you the opportunity to enhance and polish your speaking skills."</p>
      <p>Toastmasters Moree meets on the second and fourth Wednesday of the month at the upstairs section of the Wesley Court, on the corner of Frome and Heber streets.
