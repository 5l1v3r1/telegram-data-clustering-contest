      <p>Google has announced that <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/165238-google-releases-cloud-print-app-for-android/">Cloud Print</a> will be sailing into the sunset beginning in 2020. Honestly, this probably isn’t a big deal, since I doubt many people use it, enterprise customers never adopted it, and other pieces of Google’s ecosystem will pick up the slack. But <i>come on</i>, Google, <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345449-google-pixel-4-4k60fps/">this looks </a><i><a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345449-google-pixel-4-4k60fps/">terrible</a></i>.</p>
      <p>After a year of <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/338209-allo-goodbye-download-your-allo-chats-before-google-shuts-it-down-today/">slaughtering services</a> left and <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/338792-spark-email-launches-on-android-just-in-time-to-replace-google-inbox/">right</a>, and tons of apprehension over how long Google will <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/338867-google-play-music-proves-why-google-stadia-is-going-to-fail/">actually support Stadia</a>, the last thing they needed to do was announce anything at all getting removed from their portfolio. Stadia can’t even get out of the gate in a functional matter, so it really doesn’t need any help to make the whole situation look worse.</p>
      <p>Since Cloud Print is going to be supported until 2020 anyway, why wouldn’t you wait until the end of the year to make this announcement? Give Stadia a little bit of time to stand on its own before you recommit to filling your graveyard.</p>
      <p>Killing Cloud Print is fine, but the timing could not have been worse. Get a better PR department, Google.</p>
