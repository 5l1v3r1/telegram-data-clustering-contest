      <h1>Steam Remote Play Together Goes Live; Lets You Invite Friends On iOS and Android Devices</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:25:29+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/john/" target="_blank">John Law</a></address>
      <p>Steam Remote Play Together has officially exited its beta phase and is now a full-fledged feature on Valve’s digital gaming platform. Announced nearly a month ago, the feature provides online support for local multiplayer games, but more importantly, the official release also brings support for iOS and Android devices as well.</p>
      <p>As to how the feature works, Valve explains on its Steam platform that you’ll first need to launch your game (obviously). Once launched, simply access the platform’s Friends List, right-click and chose the “Remote Play Together” option in the tabs. Once the friend in question accepts the invite, you should, in effect, be able to start playing together.</p>

      <p>At the time of writing, we’ve not been able to test Remote Play Together on either iOS and Android, and as such, it’s difficult to ascertain what sort of network latency we would be getting.</p>
      <p>On another note, Steam’s currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/together">having a sale</a> on a plethora of local multiplayer titles. The list includes Towerfall Ascension, Overcooked 2, and Cuphead, to name a few.</p>
