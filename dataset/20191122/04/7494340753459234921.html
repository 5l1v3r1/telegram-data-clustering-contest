      <h1>Facebook Built a Facial Recognition App That Let Employees Identify People By Pointing a Phone at Them</h1>

      <p>Facebook once built an internal app that let employees <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-built-internal-facial-recognition-camera-app-2019-11">identify people using facial recognition and their phone cameras</a>, <i>Business Insider</i> reported Friday. From the report:<i> The app, which was developed between 2015 and 2016, utilised Facebook's vast collection of user identities to automatically recognise the person at whom the phone's camera was pointed. The app was not released publicly, and Facebook tells Business Insider that it only worked on company employees and any of their friends who opted in to the social network's facial recognition system. "As a way to learn about new technologies, our teams regularly build apps to use internally. The apps described here were only available to Facebook employees, and could only recognize employees and their friends who had face recognition enabled," said a Facebook spokesperson. The existence of the app illustrates how Facebook has been quick to experiment with technology that could have significant societal implications.</i></p>
