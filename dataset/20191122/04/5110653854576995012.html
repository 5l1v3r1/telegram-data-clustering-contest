      <h1>Calgary Flames set embarrassing franchise record in sixth consecutive loss</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:12:59+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:12</time> by <a rel="author">Tommy McArdle</a></address>
      <p>It's not the kind of record the Calgary Flames wanted to set.</p>
      <p>Not only did the team's 5-0 loss to the St. Louis Blues on Thursday extended their losing streak to six games, but it marked an entirely separate low: the Flames haven't even held the lead in nearly that entire timeframe.</p>

      <p>The last time Bill Peters' team held any sort of lead was during their <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/boxscores/201911070CGY.html">5-2 victory over the New Jersey Devils</a>on Nov. 7, when Sean Monahan scored a go-ahead goal halfway through the second period.</p>
      <p>Since then? Six consecutive losses. Calgary has been outscored 23-5 in those games. They have notplayed even with the score tied since a <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/boxscores/201911090CGY.html">Nov. 9 game against St. Louis</a> went to overtime (the Flames lost 3-2). The Flameshavebeen <a href="https://twitter.com/SNstats/status/1197719540395888640">shut out in three straight road games</a> for the first time in franchise history.</p>
      <p>Calgary playersreportedly held their <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanNPike/status/1197722541860671494">second closed-door meeting</a> in the locker room in just eight games after the latest beating, in which team captain <a href="https://twitter.com/SNryanleslie/status/1197723576020934656">Mark Giordano told reporters</a> they offered "just a lot of honesty" to one another.</p>
      <p>Head coach <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/calgary-flames-bill-peters-speaks-candidly-on-teams-struggles-we-need-more/fatczxhvacbzjdq67p2k4ib">Peters told reporters on Nov. 5</a> that the Flames "need more out of some veteran guys"amid theirugly downward trajectory, disappointing for a groupthat expected to contend as the Western Conference's<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/why-the-calgary-flames-will-win-the-western-conference-again-and-why-they-wont/pqx45mupifnu1l7f88lst570z">team to beat again this season</a>.</p>
      <p>The team will need to find that "more" soon or face season-defining consequences.After all, a certainteam east of Alberta just recently went<a href="https://twitter.com/SNstats/status/1197008433909829633">400 minutes without holding a lead</a>, and their coach was fired.</p>
