      <h1>Goldmans Sachs thinks Medibank shares are a sell</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:46:36+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/tmfdelboy/" target="_blank">Tom Richardson</a></address>
      <p>It could be time to sell your <b>Medibank Private Ltd</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Medibank+Private+Ltd/?ticker=ASX-MPL">(ASX: MPL)</a> shares if the analysts at Goldman Sachs are on the money. According to a November 19 research note out of the Goldman’s desk Medibank’s 12-month share price target is just $2.68.</p>
      <p>Goldman’s is bearish on both Medibank and <b>NIB Holdings Limited</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/NIB+Holdings+Limited/?ticker=ASX-NHF">(ASX: NHF)</a> on the back of September quarter data out of APRA on the private health insurance industry.</p>
      <p>According to Goldman’s the data points to rising claims costs and lower policy take ups.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Goldman’s is worried that claims inflation will outpace the level of premium increases (estimated at &lt;3%) the government will permit in 2020.</p>
      <p>This suggests gross margins are set to come under pressure and “seems at odds with current c.20x PEs (price-to-earnings multiples) for MPL/NHF.”</p>
      <p>If Goldman’s analysis is on the money Medibank shares cloud slide around 14% in less than 12 months.</p>
