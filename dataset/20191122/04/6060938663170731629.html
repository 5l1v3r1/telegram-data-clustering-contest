      <h1>Shilpa Shetty Kundra takes time off to celebrate her 10th wedding anniversary</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:03:34+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:03</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>One of Bollywood’s fittest and finest actresses, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shilpa-Shetty">Shilpa Shetty</a> Kundra tied the knot with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Raj-Kundra">Raj Kundra</a> on 22nd November 2009. And this year, her <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/wedding">wedding</a> anniversary is more special as the couple completes a decade of togetherness today. Both Shilpa and Raj have chosen to keep the anniversary, a low-key affair, rather than having a grand celebration.</p>
      <p>The multi-talented actress, who had been juggling several professional commitments, planned to hit pause and take a break from work. However, Raj whisked off Shilpa to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Japan">Japan</a> for a three-day-trip. According to a source, Shilpa had been working around the clock and took a break from her choc-o-bloc shoot schedule for bringing in the special day with her better half.</p>
      <p>Talking about the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/anniversary">anniversary</a> Shilpa says, “Our journey so far has been beautiful and I have loved every part of it. These 10 years have definitely been very memorable and while a decade is a milestone for any marriage, I wanted a break from work and keep the celebrations modest. A trip to Japan was Raj's idea.”</p>
      <p>Shilpa is awaiting the release of her movie 'Nikamma', which is on floors currently. The actress has been an inspiration to many, especially for the way she manages both her family and work while being a fitness icon.</p>
