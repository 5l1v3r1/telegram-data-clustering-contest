      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:57:07+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Security concerns meant the Cricket Association of Bengal canceled its plan to have Army paratroopers flying into the Eden Gardens to hand over a pink ball each to the captains before the toss of the day-night Test.</p>
      <p>According to sources at CAB, the security clearance did not come a day ahead of the historic match between India and Bangladesh here.</p>
      <p>Union Home Minister Amit Shah won’t be in attendance as per the final programme list sent by the CAB. Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and West Bengal Chief Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mamata-banerjee">Mamata Banerjee</a> will inaugurate India’s first-ever D/N Test by ringing the customary Eden Bell just before the start of play.</p>
      <p>With the match taking place in winter, there is also a change in the conventional pink ball Test timing, where tea break is followed by a lengthy 40-minute supper. The Eden Test will have the usual lunch break after the first session, at 3pm, while the last break would be tea, spanning 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>As per the ICC norm, playing conditions can be altered by mutual consent of both the countries.</p>
