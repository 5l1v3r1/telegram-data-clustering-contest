      <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled the electric-car company’s newest vehicle, the Cybertruck, on Thursday night,</p>
      <p>It’s the company’s first passenger truck.</p>
      <p>“Trucks have been the same for a very long time,” Musk said in his opening remarks, while images of a variety of conventional passenger trucks flashed by on a screen behind him. A caption on the screen read: “100 years of the same.”</p>
      <p>Soon, the Cybertruck rolled onto the stage, boasting an angular industrial shape, a single headlight that runs the width of the front end, and a matching tail light out back.</p>

      <p>The Cybertruck is made of a heavy-duty exterior shell made from “ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled stainless steel” and armored glass, according to Tesla. Musk took pains to show the Cybertruck as being unlike any other production passenger truck on the road, punctuated by a 100-cubic-foot cargo area, and up to 14,000 pounds of towing capacity.</p>
      <p>Notably, Musk said, the Cybertruck employs the same alloy metal used in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-starship-nasa-saturn-v-sls-moon-rockets-comparison-2019-7">Starship, the stainless-steel rocket SpaceX is developing</a> to be used for travel to Mars.</p>
      <p>But it still comes with some conventional features like two rows of seats that can fit up to six passengers, an adaptive air suspension, and Tesla’s Autopilot semi-self-driving technology.</p>
      <p>Musk says the Cybertruck will be available in three different range varieties: 250 miles, 300 miles, and 500 miles. It starts at $39,990.</p>
