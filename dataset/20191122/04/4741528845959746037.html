      <p>Counterfeit currency notes worth N2.5 million have been impounded by the Ogun Area 1 Command of the <b>Nigeria Customs Service</b>, as reported by <a href="https://punchng.com/customs-intercept-n2-5m-fake-currency/">Punch</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Michael Agbara</b>, the command’s Controller explained that the counterfeit notes were seized due to diligence on the part of the command.</p>
      <p><b>The Details</b>: The fake notes were found in the possession of Samson Odejiba, a palm wine tapper who was promised N5,000 as a reward for the job.</p>

      <p><b>Confessing to the crime</b>, Odejiba said an Alfa contracted him to transport the money from Idiroko to Owode.</p>
      <p><b>In addition to this</b>, 40 drums of ethanol were also seized by the command. Agbara noted that the suspects carrying industrial product would be persecuted while the products would be confiscated.</p>
      <p>“<i>These 40 drums contain industrial alcohol known as ethanol. This is strictly stamped by the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control for industrial use but the criminals sold it to the public who mix it with water and take it as alcoholic drinks.</i></p>
      <p><i>“This is harmful to the health of the people. It is a criminal activity for anyone to convert it to domestic use,</i>” Agbara said.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>Also, an illegal petrol bunker</b> used to smuggle Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) was uncovered by the command. About 160 jerry cans of 25 litres were recovered by the command.</p>
      <p>“<i>The smugglers hid the tanker in the bush and used other vehicles to shield it from public view. From the bush, a pipe was constructed and fuel is siphoned from the tankers and fed into jerry cans</i>,” Agbara said.</p>
      <p><b>As reported by <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2019/11/11/nigeria-customs-service-records-n1-002trn-revenue-in-9-months/">Nairametrics</a>,</b> N1.002 trillion was generated between January and September 2019 by the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS). This is according to data from the Department of Research and Statistics.</p>
      <p><b>The data</b>, which was also confirmed by the NCS’s Public Relations Office, indicated that the revenue was generated from 32 commands.</p>
      <p><b>The statistics showed that</b> the Apapa Area Command generated the highest revenue of N313.5 billion within the period under review. It also indicated that immediately after the partial closure of borders, the service recorded N115.6 billion in September, with about N6.1 billion more than what was realized in August before borders were closed.</p>
