      <p><b>Q: Why do you have Ohio State over LSU right now? </b><br/>A: Ohio State is the most balanced team in the country. It is certainly close, but Ohio State has the No. 1 scoring offense and scoring defense in the country. They have elite-level talent. When you look at next year’s draft, it is going to be littered with Ohio State players. … LSU has shown some weakness on the defensive side, namely giving up over 400 yards rushing to Ole Miss.</p>
      <p><b>Q: Where does Ryan Day deserve the most credit after taking over for Urban Meyer? </b><br/>A: He has allowed the players to motivate themselves. This is a group that is highly motivated on the defensive side. So, what Ryan did was revamp the defensive staff and I think he brought in the right combination of coaches that would not only motivate the players, but put control of the team back into the locker room.</p>
      <p><b>Q: You gave an impassioned defense of Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh last week. Did he need to win the Notre Dame game this year to keep his job? </b><br/>A: I still don’t believe he was going to get pushed out. Having said that, there is truth that he has not measured up in rivalry games. The biggest one of all is next week. They don’t care if they win the division, the conference, go to the Rose Bowl — they just want to beat Ohio State. They want to beat them so bad. Next week he has a chance to turn the entire narrative of his tenure around if he can beat the strongest Ohio State team I can remember. But I think they are on the right track and have been much better than they have been in past years. That’s where my “defense” of him came from. I am not particularly close with Harbaugh. I am not a shill for the program.</p>
      <p><b>Q: What was going through your head when you heard about the Tua injury? </b><br/>A: I am devastated, heartbroken. My producer told me in my ear before we were about to go to a game break, “Tua’s down, it looks really serious, it’s not the ankle.” My heart sank. I pray that this is not a career-threatening injury. There’s an anxiousness and anxiety that comes with an injury like this, if you remember what happened to Bo Jackson.<br/><b><br/>Q: How does his injury change the playoffs? </b><br/>A: This is exactly why he have a committee of 13 people instead of computers. It is my belief they should and would penalize Alabama, particularly if they show they are a weaker team without Tua. People will point to [Ohio State’s] Cardale Jones [replacing an injured R.J. Barrett], but they beat Wisconsin 59-0 and showed they might even be better with Cardale. So, now it is incumbent on Alabama and Mac Jones to beat Auburn handily to show they are the same or better without Tua.</p>
