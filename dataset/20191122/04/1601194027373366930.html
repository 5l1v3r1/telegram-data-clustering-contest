      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/jon-jones">Jon Jones</a> now has three potential challengers lined up for him - <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/dominick-reyes">Dominick Reyes</a>, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/corey-anderson">Corey Anderson</a>, and Jan Blachowicz, all of whom are coming off multi-fight win streaks. While the former two have a better claim to a title shot, the champion has chosen Reyes to be his next challenger, considering him to be a bigger challenge.</p>
      <p>He hasn't been all too impressed with Reyes either, but it seems as though he finds Anderson to be a bit of an underwhelming challenge. Corey Anderson, on the other hand, has been demanding a title shot and following a win over the much-hyped Johnny Walker, feels that he has earned the right to face Jones, even going as far as to tell the UFC that if they don't give him a title shot next, they might as well release him.</p>
      <p>Jones is now completely focused on Reyes and took to Twitter to justify his decision to face the rising Light Heavyweight.</p>

      <p>He used a bit of "MMA Math" to justify his decision to face Reyes. It's quite simple. Jones dominated Ovince Saint Preux to a dominant decision victory in his comeback fight 3 years ago and OSP subsequently finished Corey Anderson but was dominated by Reyes.</p>
      <p>That should logically state that Reyes is the toughest match-up for him, but we know that MMA math doesn't always work that way. For one, it would be unfair to Anderson as he learned a lot from that fight and has come leaps and bounds since then. While Reyes is a worthy challenger, he hasn't faced the level of adversity that Anderson has and come back from it.</p>
      <p>To add to that, fans bring up Reyes' fight against Volkan Oezdemir, where the majority believe that Oezdemir was robbed of a decision win. With that said, Reyes still presents a big challenge to Jones, but not as big as Thiago Santos was earlier this year.</p>
