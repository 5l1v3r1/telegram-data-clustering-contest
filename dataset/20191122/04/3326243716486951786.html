      <p>We all know that we do a lot more with our phones than make calls. We send text messages and emails, search for stuff on the web, and take notes. So having your iPhone keyboard settings the way you want them is important for these types of things.</p>
      <p>If you’re new to iPhone, you can customize your keyboard right off the bat so it’s ready to use when you need it. This tutorial shows you how to do that.</p>
      <h3>Access your iPhone Keyboard settings</h3>
      <p>First things first, you need to access the settings for your keyboard. Open your <b>Settings</b> and select <b>General</b>. Then scroll down and tap <b>Keyboard</b>.</p>

      <p>You can also access these settings directly from your keyboard. With the keyboard open, tap and hold the <b>smiley face </b>or<b> globe icon</b> and select <b>Keyboard Settings</b>.</p>

      <h4>Keyboards</h4>
      <p>At the very top of the next screen, you’ll see <b>Keyboards</b>. You can tap this to <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2017/05/29/how-to-change-iphone-keyboard-layout/">choose your keyboard layout</a> like QWERY, AZERTY, or QWERTZ. This is also where you can add more keyboards like those in other languages or third-party keyboard apps that you install.</p>

      <h4>Shortcuts</h4>
      <p>Back to the Keyboards screen, you’ll next see <b>Text Replacement</b> and <b>One Handed Keyboard</b> options.</p>
      <p>If you tap <b>Text Replacement</b>, you can <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2018/05/18/text-replacements-iphone-keyboard/">set up keyboard shortcuts</a>. This lets you enter the keys you want to use as a shortcut and the entire phrase or sentence that will pop in. For instance, you can set up a shortcut for when you type “tyt” it displays as “Thank you for your time!”.</p>

      <p>If you tap <b>One Handed Keyboard</b>, you can choose from Left or Right depending on your prominent hand. This will <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2017/07/18/how-to-use-one-handed-iphone-keyboard/">shift the keyboard slightly</a> in the direction you need to type with one hand.</p>

      <h4>Options</h4>
      <p>The final section on the Keyboards screen is for all of your keyboard options. You can enable or disable each one using the toggle.</p>

      <p>Here you can enable features like auto-correction, spell-check, predictive text, and <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/08/16/iphone-swipe-keyboard-tutorial/">slide to type</a>. Each of these features is helpful in its own way. However, we do know the risks of auto-correction (wink), so use the features at your discretion.</p>
      <h3>Wrapping it up</h3>
      <p>As a new iPhone user, these keyboard settings can help you type faster, more accurately, or in another dialect when needed. So get your keyboard set up for the ways you’ll use it most right from the start.</p>
