      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/michael-jordan">Michael Jordan</a> laced up the first pair of Air Jordan 4s at the 1989 NBA All-Star break and it’s been one of the most appreciated Jordans ever since. Celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Air Jordan 4, Jordan Brand is bringing the shoe full circle by delivering a retro design mash-up of three of the most notable Jordan 4 colorways, culminating in the <a href="https://stockx.com/air-jordan-4-retro-what-the?utm_source=Hypebeast&amp;utm_medium=editorial&amp;utm_campaign=Jordan_4_What_The">Air Jordan 4 “What The”</a>. Currently available <a href="https://stockx.com/?utm_source=Hypebeast&amp;utm_medium=editorial&amp;utm_campaign=Jordan_4_What_The">on StockX</a>, the sneaker has already amassed an average price of $242 USD and sold 652 pairs.</p>
      <p>The Jordan 4 “What The” combines four signature colorways, including “<a href="https://stockx.com/jordan-4-retro-white-cement-2016?utm_source=Hypebeast&amp;utm_medium=editorial&amp;utm_campaign=Jordan_4_What_The">White Cement</a>,” “<a href="https://stockx.com/jordan-4-retro-military-blue-2012?utm_source=Hypebeast&amp;utm_medium=editorial&amp;utm_campaign=Jordan_4_What_The">Military Blue</a>,” and “<a href="https://stockx.com/jordan-4-retro-fire-red-2012?utm_source=Hypebeast&amp;utm_medium=editorial&amp;utm_campaign=Jordan_4_What_The">Fire Red</a>“  to create a modern amalgamation of the silhouette. With a crisp white leather base, this Jordan 4 provides a clean canvas for the vibrant red and blue accents to shine alongside the cement midsoles. Somewhat hidden, the shoe’s most unique detail finds itself encoded on the lace tips, featuring a series of numbers, which is actually the original Air Jordan 4 product code from 30 years ago. And finally, the mismatched Jumpman fabric patch tongues, inversed insoles with Nike Air logos, branded heel labels and contrasting outsoles allow for the blending of these classic Jordan colorblocking sensibilities to achieve the perfect reconstructed balance of iconic OG features and new innovative touches.</p>
