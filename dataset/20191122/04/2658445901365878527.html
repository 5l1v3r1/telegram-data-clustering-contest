      <p>THE Regional Head, Southwest 1 at Fidelity Bank Plc, Mr. Adebayo Adeyinka, has decried the rate at which youths commit suicide following failure in exams.</p>
      <p>He spoke on Thursday at the 2019 National Pre-University Conference in Badagry, Lagos State.</p>
      <p>It was organised by CityMood Communications.</p>
      <p>Adeyinka said: “Youths are committing suicide because of academic failure, not knowing that failure is part of life.</p>
      <p>“Suicide is not the next thing in life. If you fail the first time, prepare and do it again.</p>
      <p>“Nothing can stop you, not even lack of resource can stop you from achieving your dreams. It is only you that can stop you in life.”</p>
      <p>He urged students who did not get admission to institutions of their choice after several attempts to work hard and prepare to do it again, saying nothing good comes easily.</p>

      <p>A confidence coach, Ms Chizobam Ofoegbu, enjoined students to be careful about the type of groups they associate with in higher institutions.</p>
      <p>She said peer pressure was the No. 1 killer of youths.</p>
      <p>Ofoegbu advised them to associate with people of the same character and value.</p>
      <p>An author and youth leadership expert, Mr. Folaranmi Oyediran, urged students seeking admission to know the purpose of going to the university.</p>
      <p>Executive Director of Equip Africa Opeyemi Oke advised students with talents to utilise them.</p>
      <p>He implored parents to allow their children explore their talents, and enjoined students to search for their talents and develop them.</p>
