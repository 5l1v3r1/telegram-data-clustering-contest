      <h3>David Luiz is backing Gabriel Martinelli to be a big success at Arsenal in the years to come.</h3>
      <p>The teenage Brazilian forward has been getting used to life at Arsenal after having signed for the Gunners from Ituano in July of this year.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old has scored three goals and made one assist in three Europa League games for Arsenal so far this season, and he has also made four appearances from the bench in the Premier League for Unai Emery’s men.</p>
      <p>Martinelli will be hoping to hold down more of a regular spot in the starting line-up at Arsenal in the coming weeks and months as he looks to try and help the Gunners climb the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Fellow Brazilian David Luiz has been impressed by what he has seen from his compatriot and he is expecting big things from him in the coming seasons.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with Arsenal’s <a href="https://www.arsenal.com/news/martinelli-just-has-something-different">website</a>, David Luiz said: “I began admiring him for his work, mentality, his football, and his desire to learn every day.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had the chance to meet many players, many young talents from several different countries, and Gabi has something different.</p>
      <p>“If he keeps it up, he will experience great things in football. I think that is what has surprised me so far.</p>
      <p>“I met his parents, it’s not a coincidence that he has been successful. His upbringing had education, purpose, and it’s a great pleasure to be here with Gabriel.</p>
      <p>“He welcomed me here, he was here before me. We try to have the best possible relationship, we help each other out.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal will return to Premier League action on Saturday afternoon when they host Southampton in the top flight.</p>
      <p>They are aiming to return to winning ways in the top flight after the disappointment of their 2-0 loss to Leicester City last time out.</p>
