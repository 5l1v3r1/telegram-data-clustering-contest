      <h1>Tesla Cybertruck pickup: ultra hard stainless steel, 0-60 in 2.9 secs, 14k lbs towing capacity, and $40k base price</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:57:17+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:57</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Alvarez</a></address>
      <p>Tesla has revealed its highly-anticipated pickup truck to the public, and it is every bit the monster that CEO Elon Musk has made it out to be. With its aggressive stance, high ground clearance, and massive frame, the Tesla’s CYBRTRK is quite a sight to behold. It also shows that while Tesla has pretty much created stunning city cars until today, the company is every bit as capable of creating a daunting machine that can perform just as well on paved roads as it does on rough terrain. </p>
      <h3>Design </h3>
      <p>The Tesla Cybertruck does not look like a traditional pickup. True to Elon Musk’s words, the vehicle does look like a futuristic armored personnel carrier that stepped out of the set of <i>Blade Runner</i>. Its straight sloping roof give the pickup a streamlined yet very unique look. As the Tesla CEO has stated in the past, the Cybertruck won’t look like any other pickup on the road today. </p>
      <p>That being said, there are several key design aspects that are notable about the Cybertruck. These include its extremely angular body, its large bed, and its high ground clearance. The Cybertruck also has a thick stainless steel body, which Tesla demonstrated by having a sledgehammer hit the pickup’s door panel. The vehicle is also fitted with Tesla’s Armor Glass, which unfortunately cracked after a large steel ball was thrown at it onstage. The metal ball didn’t go through the glass though, which is a plus.</p>

      <h3>Specs</h3>
      <p>Tesla has pretty much mastered the art of keeping the specs of its upcoming vehicles’ secret. As it turns out, the <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-pickup-truck-6-seats-300k-towing-capacity/">Cybertruck’s performance figures</a> are definitely worth the secrecy, as they are flat-out insane. The vehicle is equipped with a standard single motor and can be upgraded to dual and tri-motors. Just as Musk said, the Cybertruck, despite its size, is quite nimble, thanks to its instant torque and adaptive air suspension that can adjust height to meet the vehicle’s intended purpose. These ultimately allow the Cybertruck to hit 60 mph in just 2.9 seconds, with handling comparable to a Porsche.</p>
      <p>Here are other notable specs of the Tesla Cybertruck: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>250+, 300+, and 500+ miles of range</li>
        <li>3500 lbs payload</li>
        <li>Towing rating between 7.5k to 14k lbs</li>
        <li>250 kW charging</li>
        <li>Off-road performance with 35 degrees approach angle, up to 16″ clearance, and 28 degrees departure angle</li>
        <li>100 cubic feet of exterior storage</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Special Features</h3>
      <p>Pickups are utility vehicles by nature, and as such, they are used primarily for work on locations such as farms or construction sites. Luxury pickups exist that prioritize comfort over utility, but <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-tesla-pickup-truck-features-wish-list/">Tesla’s monster pickup</a> has chosen to do both. The interior of the Cybertruck is classic Tesla in the way that it’s minimalist and airy, with plush seats and a massive touchscreen that’s optimized for work and even entertainment. This, however, is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the pickup truck’s notable features. Others include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>110v/220v onboard outlets</li>
        <li>Full Self-Driving features</li>
        <li>Autopilot as standard</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Price</h3>
      <p>Earlier this year, Elon Musk has mentioned that the Tesla Cybertruck would <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-pickup-truck-price-elon-musk/">start at $49,000 at the highest</a>. Tesla has stayed true to its CEO’s words, pricing the futuristic pickup truck very aggressively compared to other EV trucks and ICE-powered luxury pickups. Tesla’s Cybertruck does have a number of higher-priced trims, and these cost substantially more, while offering significantly more. </p>
      <p>Here’s the complete pricing of Tesla’s Cybertruck depending on its trim. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Single Motor RWD – $39,900 before options</li>
        <li>Dual Motor AWD – $49,900 before options</li>
        <li>Tri-Motor AWD – $69,900 before options</li>
      </ul>
