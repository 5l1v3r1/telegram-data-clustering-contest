      <p>Huawei Mate X 5G foldable phone sells out for the third time<br/>5 (100%) 2 votes</p>
      <p>A couple of weeks ago, the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/huawei-mate-x">Huawei Mate X</a> 5G foldable phone officially hit the market. Since then, it has been on sale three times. The third official sale took place today and this 16,999 ($2416) machine sold out swiftly again. Since we don’t have the official number of units that hit the store, we cant not be sure about the market acceptance of this device. Certainly, 500 units will not be a challenge to sell. Nevertheless, the user rating of this device on Huawei’s official mall exceeds 200 for now. Giving that only a small fraction of buyers come back to give ratings, it seems that this device is quite popular. The fourth round of sales will take place at 10:08 on November 29.</p>
