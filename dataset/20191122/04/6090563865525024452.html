      <p>Posting on Twitter, Moyo said:</p>
      <blockquote>The Police Support Unit is currently conducting <i>#CrowdControl </i>training at 2 Brigade, Cranbone, bringing together the Army, Police &amp; CIO. The vicious “cops” that unleashed yesterday’s gratuitous violence on MDC supporters, bystanders &amp; passersbys came from the 2 Brigade Unit!</blockquote>

      <p>Moyo’s theory concurrs with that of Team Pachedu who suggested that the sjamboks which were used to beat protesters are used by soldiers and not the police.</p>
