      <h3>Sadio Mane has described Jurgen Klopp as the best manager in the world following the success he has brought to Liverpool FC.</h3>
      <p>Klopp has been earning lots of praise for the impact he has had at Anfield after having taken over from Brendan Rodgers back in October 2015.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC are currently flying high at the top of the table after having won 11 of their 12 Premier League games this season under Klopp.</p>
      <p>The Merseyside outfit also enjoyed their first taste of major silverware under Klopp last season as they won the Champions League trophy in style.</p>
      <p>Mane has been thriving under Klopp in recent seasons and the Senegal international has already scored seven goals and made two assists in 12 Premier League games so far this term.</p>
      <p>Now, the 27-year-old attacker has underlined just how important Klopp has been to Liverpool FC’s recent success.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1207270/Sadio-Mane-Liverpool-Jurgen-Klopp">Daily Express</a>, Mane said: “I would struggle to describe just how successful he has been for Liverpool.</p>
      <p>“Everybody can see what he has done for this club, for this city and the quality he has as a manager.</p>
      <p>“There are a lot of good managers in Europe but what I can say is that our manager always has the right words and the right things to manage his team, especially knowing how to deal with his team.</p>
      <p>“I would always trust his influence on the team.</p>
      <p>“He is a winner and I would say he is the best in the world.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC will return to Premier League action on Saturday afternoon when they take on Crystal Palace away from home.</p>
      <p>They managed to pull eight points clear at the top of the table thanks to a 3-1 win over Manchester City at Anfield last time out.</p>
