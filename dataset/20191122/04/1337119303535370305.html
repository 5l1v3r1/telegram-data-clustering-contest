      <h1>Tesla made an ATV to complement its futuristic Cybertruck</h1>
      <h2>‘One more thing’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:39:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-j-hawkins" target="_blank">Andrew J. Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>At the Tesla Cybertruck event in Los Angeles on Thursday, Elon Musk said three words most of the tech world is familiar with: “One more thing.” That turned out to be an electric all-terrain vehicle. The ATV can charge from the bed of the Cybertruck, naturally.</p>
      <p>The Tesla ATV’s aesthetic is still very much in the <i>Blade Runner </i>motif that Musk touted in the run-up to the event. We’ll have more details about the ATV as we get them from Tesla, so stay tuned.</p>

      <p><i><b>Update November 22nd, 3:56PM ET: </b></i>Over 12 hours after the event, Tesla has yet to release any specs related to the ATV. But we do have a few more details.</p>
      <p>First, the ATV is called the Tesla Cyberquad. Second, Musk tweeted earlier today that it will be first be made available as an option with the Cybertruck. So that means it won’t be sold as a stand-alone vehicle — at least not initially. The CEO also confirmed that the ATV will be a two-seater.</p>
      <p>During the event, Musk also demonstrated a cool feature that helps explain why both vehicles are being offered as a package. The ATV can be charged from the bed of the Cybertruck by plugging into the truck’s outlet.</p>
