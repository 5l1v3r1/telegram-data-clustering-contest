      <h1>Tiny Harrisâ€™ Daughter Heiress Sings Backup For Her Mom And Sheâ€™s A Natural â€“ Check Out The Adorable Video!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:57:32+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:57</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Mitchell</a></address>
      <p>Sheâ€™s only three years old but her mom can already count on her to save the day! Little Heiress Harris was quick to replace one of Tinyâ€™s backup singers when they couldnâ€™t make it!</p>
      <p>The whole situation made for an adorable video that showed the child being an absolute natural on stage, just like her mom!</p>
      <p>Heiress looks like she has a great future in the music industry judging by her latest performance as Tinyâ€™s backup singer as she took command of the mic, even stealing some of the spotlight from her mother!</p>
      <p>Either way, it was a great thing that she took on the job, helping Tiny out after one of her original backup singers could not be at a rehearsal for her R&amp;B Rewind Concert Series show set to take place in a couple of days.</p>
      <p>The tot did not deal with any stage fright and confidently sang into the mic alongside her mommyâ€™s professional backup singers while she was rehearsing her brand new single titled I F**kin &lt;3 you.</p>
      <p>Tiny took to social media to share one of the videos they shot of the run-down and at some point, the mom and daughter even became more of a duo since she knelt down beside Heiress, singing together side by side.</p>

      <p>In the caption, the proud mother wrote: â€˜So this happen today!! First day of rehearsal for my next show Nov. 24 and one of my background singers didnâ€™t make it so Lil Miss Heiress decided she was gone fill in. She was so serious!! What yâ€™all think? Should I add me another singerðŸ¤ª ðŸ‘‘ðŸ’œ.â€™</p>
      <p>Is that even a question? Heiress should definitely join in for the actual show as well!</p>
      <p>After all, she already knows all the words to the song as proven by the clip Tiny shared with her many followers.</p>
