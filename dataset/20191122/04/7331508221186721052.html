      <h1>Colts' division title -- and playoff -- hopes take a significant hit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T04:34:35+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 04:34</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Wells</a></address>
      <p>HOUSTON -- The <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts">Indianapolis Colts</a> went from being in control of the AFC South to needing to take care of their business and get help from others after a 20-17 loss to the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/hou/houston-texans">Houston Texans</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>A victory would have given the Colts a season sweep of the Texans and sole possession of the division lead. The Colts (6-5) went from having a 74% chance to win the division with a win to seeing those odds reduced to 19% with the defeat.</p>
      <p>Colts defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus' unit went from being a bend-but-don't-break group to one that couldn't stop Houston's offense from getting chunk plays.</p>
      <p>The Colts gave up four pass plays of at least 30 yards, with two of them being touchdowns to Houston receiver <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15795/deandre-hopkins">DeAndre Hopkins</a>.</p>
      <p>The Colts have only one game left against a team that currently has a winning record -- at New Orleans -- but the Texans, who now have a one-game lead over Indianapolis in the division, also have a favorable schedule down the stretch.</p>
      <p>In its final five games, Houston plays only one team -- New England -- that currently has a winning record. The Texans still have two games left against the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ten/tennessee-titans">Tennessee Titans</a>, who are 5-5.</p>

      <p>The Colts blew their chance at trying to send Thursday's game into overtime when quarterback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2578570/jacoby-brissett">Jacoby Brissett</a>, not able to find anybody open down the field in Texans territory, came up a yard short of a first down on his fourth-down run with less than three minutes left in the game.</p>
      <p>A wild-card spot might end up being the Colts' best chance to make the playoffs based on Houston's schedule, and even then that might be tough to accomplish because Pittsburgh (5-5) and Oakland (6-4) -- who have both already beaten the Colts this season -- are also in the thick of the hunt.</p>
      <p><b>Buy a breakout performance:</b> Running back <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2980077/jonathan-williams">Jonathan Williams</a> didn't hurt the Colts in the ground game in <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139605/marlon-mack">Marlon Mack</a>'s absence. Williams, starting because Mack is out because of a fractured left hand, had 26 carries for 104 yards, including a 13-yard touchdown run. The 104-yard outing followed the career-high 116 yards Williams rushed for against Jacksonville in Week 11 -- after running for a total of one yard this season before playing the Jaguars.</p>
      <p><b>Pivotal play(s):</b> Receiver <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14924/ty-hilton">T.Y. Hilton</a> returned to the lineup after missing the previous three games because of a calf injury. The time off -- just one light practice during the three weeks he missed -- affected Hilton's performance. He finished with three receptions on six targets for 18 yards while playing on a snap count -- and had two of the biggest drops of the game on third down on back-to-back drives in the fourth quarter. That's a drastic drop-off from Hilton's previous trips to Houston. He entered Thursday averaging 133.3 yards per game against the Texans in his career in games at Houston.</p>
