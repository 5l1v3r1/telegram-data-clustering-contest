      <p>In 2017 at <a href="https://people.com/bodies/jennifer-lawrence-told-to-lose-weight/">Elle’s Women in Hollywood</a> event, Jennifer Lawrence spoke out about the “humiliating” and “degrading” ways the film industry approaches body image.</p>
      <p>“When I was much younger and starting out, I was told by producers of a film to lose 15 pounds in two weeks,” she said. “During this time a female producer had me do a nude line-up with about five women who were much, much thinner than me.”</p>
      <p>“We all stood side-by-side with only tape on covering our privates … the female producer told me I should use the naked photos of myself as inspiration for my diet,” she added.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/all-of-jennifer-lawrences-movies-ranked-from-worst-to-best-2019-8">She went on to say</a> that the experience made her feel “trapped” and that she now continuously reminds herself that she deserves to be treated with respect.</p>

      <p>On an emotional episode of the 2012 MTV series “<a href="https://ew.com/article/2012/11/16/amber-riley-this-is-how-i-made-it-video/">This Is How I Made It</a>,” actress Amber Riley explained that many industry professionals have told her she needed to “lose a little weight.”</p>
      <p>She added that many of the roles she has been offered were based on harmful, negative stereotypes related to her size, like “the girl who wanted to commit suicide ’cause she was fat” or the girl who sits and eats all day.</p>
      <p>And for the <a href="https://www.insider.com/first-and-last-character-outfits-glee-2019-8">“Glee” star</a>, these situations and expectations have made Hollywood “a very hard place to be in” and she has never understood why casting directors can’t just accept her for who she is.</p>

      <h3>Richard Madden said women aren’t the only ones who are told to lose weight in Hollywood.</h3>

      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/richard-madden-james-bond">British Vogue</a>, “Game of Thrones” star <a href="https://www.insider.com/worst-movies-actors-from-game-of-thrones-are-in-2019-7">Richard Madden</a> said he has had his “fat rolls” pinched and has been put in corset-like costumes because studios wanted him to look slim.</p>
      <p>“I’ve done numerous jobs where you’re told to lose weight and get to the gym,” Madden told the publication. “It doesn’t just happen to women, it happens to men all the time as well.”</p>
      <p>He acknowledged that trying to look thin on TV and in films projects “a very unrealistic body image,” but admitted that he and other actors continue to do it anyway.</p>

      <h3>Amber Tamblyn said her agent didn’t believe she’d become a star unless she lost weight.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Shortly after her success in “The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” series, actress Amber Tamblyn said her agent told her she could only be a star if she lost some weight.</p>
      <p>“I think at that point I was 128 pounds and I’m 5’7″. I remember my agent saying to me … ‘You have a real choice here. You can either be Nicole Kidman or you can be a character actress,'” Tamblyn recalled in a conversation with the <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/947475/amber-tamblyn-recalls-being-told-to-lose-weight-after-sisterhood-of-the-traveling-pants-2-it-does-something-to-you">New York Times.</a></p>
      <p>She said the experience shaped her sense of self-worth for years and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/opinion/sunday/amber-tamblyn-golden-globes-metoo.html">made</a> her feel “violated,” like she had to look a specific way or she was doomed for failure.</p>

      <h3>Sam Claflin said male actors are put under a lot of pressure to lose weight but it is “never talked about.”</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>In 2017, actor Sam Claflin told <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/sam-claflin-the-english-heartthrob-who-is-not-nicholas-hoult-or-eddie-redmayne-20170526-gwe8jv.html">The Sydney Morning Herald</a> that he has really struggled with body image and self-confidence while working in the film industry.</p>
      <p>“I remember doing one job when they literally made me pull my shirt up and were grabbing my fat and going, ‘You need to lose a bit of weight.’ This other time they were slapping me. I felt like a piece of meat,” Claflin said.</p>
      <p>“I’m not saying it’s anywhere near as bad as what women go through but I, as an actor approaching each job, am insecure – especially when I have to take my top off in it … I get really worked up to the point where I spend hours and hours in the gym and not eating for weeks to achieve what I think they’re going for,” he added.</p>
      <p>He went on to say that this pressure to be muscular and trim presents an unrealistic body image that’s “anything but normal.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.insider.com/jennifer-lopez-movies-ranked-2019-1">Jennifer Lopez told InStyle</a> that, early in her career, a lot of people in the industry told her she should lose weight. But instead of trying to change her appearance, she embraced her body type.</p>
      <p>“They didn’t bother me at all but I got a lot of flak for it from people in the industry. They’d say, ‘You should lose a few pounds,’ or ‘You should do this or do that.’ It finally got to the point that I was like, ‘This is who I am. I’m shaped like this,'” <a href="http://www.instyle.com/beauty/makeup/jennifer-lopez-inglot-beauty-routine">Lopez</a> told the publication.</p>
      <p>“Everybody I grew up with looked like that, and they were all beautiful to me. I didn’t see anything wrong with it. I still don’t,” she added.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Although she had a lot of creative control over her 2015 film “Trainwreck,” Amy Schumer still had to deal with people telling her to lose weight for the lead role.</p>
      <p>In an interview on “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGwG7_Xauk0">The Jonathan Ross Show,”</a> Schumer jokingly described the experience by saying, ” … It was explained to me before I did that movie that if you weigh over 140 pounds as a woman in Hollywood, if you’re on the screen it will hurt people’s eyes.”</p>
      <p>“So I lost some weight to do that, but never again,” she added.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Tyra Banks previously told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPw72q8x-kE">Business Insider</a> that she’s faced a lot of difficulties related to body image and unrealistic weight expectations while working in the modeling industry.</p>
      <p>In an interview, she recalled that when she a young model at the height of her high-fashion career, designers at Milan Fashion Week called her “too big.”</p>
      <p>“‘Her butt is getting too big and you need to go tell her to lose some weight,'” they told her mother Carolyn London, per Banks. She said she also got a list of designers who no longer wanted to work with her.</p>
      <p>“I started crying and I was like, ‘Mom, OK, what do I do. Should I diet? Should I work out twice a day? Should I just have salads for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?'” she told Business Insider.</p>
      <p>But Banks recalled her mom shutting down those ideas immediately, saying she’d “be damned” if her child “starved” for the modeling industry.</p>

      <p>In 2017, Ashley Graham told the <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/celebrity/ashley-graham-debuts-lingerie-line-at-las-vegas-macys/">Las Vegas Review Journal</a> that she has always experienced fat-shaming and bullying – but she didn’t realize how much this pressure to be thin impacted her until she began pursuing a modeling career.</p>
      <p>In the interview, she looked back on a time when a talent agent at a mall suggested she lose some weight so she could become a model.</p>
      <p>“The really hard moment was when my dad said, ‘Honey, if an agent is telling you to lose weight, then maybe you should lose weight.’ I was 15, standing in our living room having a moment I will never forget. I never had a parent tell me to lose weight and it hurt,” she recalled.</p>
      <p>But Graham said she doesn’t blame her father for his words – she blames the modeling industry’s unrealistic standards.</p>
      <p>“He was thinking like a businessman,” she said. “It’s not that my father didn’t love me. He wanted me to succeed.”</p>

      <p>But Cavill said he was following a poor diet at the time and, overall, the director’s comment made him rethink his physical health and how he eats.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know how to train or diet,” he told the publication. “And I’m glad Martin said something because I respond well to truth. It helps me get better.”</p>

      <p>Harbour went to the audition anyway and jokingly showed his stomach to the director saying, “I’ve got your Blob right here.”</p>
      <p>After the audition, Harbour said the director expressed “concerns” about his weight.</p>
      <p>“He was like, ‘David, look, you’re wonderful, we really think you’re just a great actor, we’re just concerned … we’re really concerned … it’s just, you lifted up your shirt and … we’re just a little worried about your health,'” Harbour told The Wrap. “I was like, ‘Wait a minute. You are telling me I’m too fat to play The Blob?'”</p>
