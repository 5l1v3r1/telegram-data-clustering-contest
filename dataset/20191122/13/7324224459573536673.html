      <h1>JAILED: Drugs gang dealt cocaine across Wolverhampton from pub base</h1>
      <h2>A pub-based drug dealing gang who supplied cocaine across Wolverhampton have been locked up for a combined 20 years</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:38:32+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/thomas-parkes/" target="_blank">Thomas Parkes</a></address>
      <p>The gang operated out of the now-shutdown Talisman pub in the Scotlands estate, where they conducted deals worth up to £10,000 and ferried drugs to other parts of the city.</p>
      <p>Six of the group have now been convicted of conspiracy to supply cocaine, with four of them locked up for a total of 21 years and seven months.</p>
      <p>The five men and one woman, all from Wolverhampton, were arrested in November last year on suspicion of supplying Class A drugs since July 2017.</p>

      <p>A further search of the pub, <a href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/crime/2019/09/28/wolverhampton-pub-which-had-licence-revoked-over-crime-could-be-demolished/">which has been earmarked for housing</a>, uncovered a raft of stolen power tools which were being sold by 52-year-old gang member Duncan McGregor.</p>
      <p>McGregor was among four men, who all lived within half a mile of the pub, who are now in prison after pleading guilty to supplying the drugs at Birmingham Crown Court.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jack Carrier, 29, of Highfield Avenue, Underhill, was jailed for five years and seven months</li>
        <li>McGregor, 52, of Westcroft Avenue, Underhill, was jailed for five years and four months</li>
        <li>Gary Manderson, 36, of Underhill Lane, Underhill, was jailed for five years and four months</li>
        <li>Jake Simpson, 26, of Blackwood Avenue in Wood Hayes, was jailed for four years and eight months</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The other two gang members – 38-year-old John Dixon and 24-year-old Alex Simpkiss – denied the charge but were convicted after a trial.</p>
      <p>Dixon, of Carisbrooke Road, and Simpkiss, of Blackwood Avenue, were both handed 18-month suspended prison sentences by the judge.</p>

      <p>The pub in Wildtree Avenue was shut down in December last year in the aftermath of the police raids.</p>
      <p>It had <a href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2016/04/01/talisman-raid-troubled-wolverhampton-pub-set-to-reopen/">previously been forced to close in 2016</a> when it was owned by Punch Taverns and crack cocaine, digital scales and cannabis were found in the bar and toilets.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2016/03/15/wolverhamptons-talisman-watch-protest-at-drug-raid-pubs-unfair-closure/">Following a protest from neighbours and customers, </a>the pub was allowed to reopen under certain conditions and was bought by Star Pubs &amp; Bars in March last year.</p>
      <p>However an undercover police operation again found evidence of gangs operating from the pub.</p>
      <p>At the licence hearing in December, Star Pubs &amp; Bars argued The Talisman was a community asset but <a href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/crime/2018/12/31/talisman-closed-after-organised-crime-gang-operated-from-wolverhampton-pub/">police said an organised crime gang in its third generation was operating from the pub</a> and its licence was revoked.</p>

      <p>Supt Tom Chisholm, from Wolverhampton Police, said: "The pub was at the heart of the illegal trade of Class A drugs which were flooding onto the streets of Wolverhampton.</p>
      <p>"Drugs can cost lives and cause other crimes which further impact on our communities as users try to fund their habits.</p>
      <p>"Through our covert operation we were able to expose this illegal business along with recovering a range of stolen items from the site.</p>
      <p>"We cut off a significant source of drugs in the city and we won’t relent in our drive to put anyone who thinks they can trade illegal substances in our city behind bars."</p>
