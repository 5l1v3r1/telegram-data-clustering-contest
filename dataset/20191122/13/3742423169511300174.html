      <h4>Is your Disney Plus freezing?</h4>
      <p>Having used the service myself, I haven't had <i>too</i> many issues. The other day, however, as I was watching <i>The Mandalorian</i>'s second episode, I noticed a few glitches. I was eating dinner so I was half-watching the intro but when I looked up, I'd noticed the screen had frozen while the audio continued. After a quick pause and play, it continued on fine for the rest of the episode. Frustratingly, I did have to switch off the subtitles because they were a full second or two in front of the footage.</p>
      <p>While it might not fix <i>every</i> issue you encounter, we've consulted <a href="https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_index">Disney+'s troubleshooting page</a> so you don't have to.</p>

      <h3>My Disney Plus still isn't working. How do I fix it?</h3>
      <p>If none of Disney's tips are fixing your issues, you've still got a few options. The first one is really simple, test out other services you have. Check Netflix or Stan if you have subscriptions with those and if not, load up YouTube. If it's still buffering, then the issue is your internet, which means it might not be able to keep up with your data needs or there could be an ISP or modem issue.</p>
      <p>Once you've tested other devices to confirm it's not your internet, it's time to bring Disney in. Take screenshots or photos for proof, log the issues and when they occurred and take all the evidence to <a href="https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_index">Disney's Help Desk</a>. There's a live chat option otherwise you'll be call the support team or ping them on social media. It's open seven days a week from 8am to midnight, according to the site.</p>
      <p>Good luck and may The Force be with you.</p>
