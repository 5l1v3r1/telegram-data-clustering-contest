      <h1>Uddhav Thackeray is top choice for Maharashtra CM’s post as govt-formation enters last lap</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:50:45+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:50</time> by <a rel="author">Our Bureau</a></address>
      <p>Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) President Sharad Pawar on Friday said that the Congress, the Shiv Sena and the NCP had reached a consensus on Uddhav Thackeray for the Maharashtra Chief Minister’s post.</p>
      <p>“There are no two (different) views on the issue of (post of) CM. There is consensus (among the parties) that the government must function under the leadership of Uddhav Thackeray. This (who should be CM) is not an issue (now). Leadership issue is not pending. I am telling again and again… there is a consensus among us on Udhav Thackeray’s leadership. Discussions are on about the other details/programmes (Common minimum programme). Tomorrow, there will be a press conference to announce all details,” Pawar told reporters in Mumbai.</p>
      <p>Pawar, along with senior Congress leaders and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, held discussions for over 40 minutes in Mumbai.</p>
      <p>Thackeray told the media that leaders of the three parties will together on Saturday answer all the questions. Asked who will lead the government, Uddhav said details will be out soon.</p>
      <p>Pawar and Congress leaders have been insisting that Uddhav take over the reins as Chief Minister if the government is to complete its five-year term. Names of Shiv Sena leaders, including Eknath Shinde, Subhash Desai and Sanjay Raut, were making the rounds for CM’s post. However, according to sources, the Congress and the NCP leadership insisted on Uddhav.</p>
      <p>Post-poll drama</p>
      <p>After the election results, Uddhav insisted that BJP National President Amit Shah fulfil his promise of sharing the CM’s post with the Sena. Shah and State BJP leaders claimed that no such promise was made and that there was no question of sharing the CM’s post. This led to a face-off between the pre-poll allies, with the BJP, the single largest party, opting out of the race.</p>
      <p>President’s rule was imposed in Maharashtra on November 12 with no party or alliance able to form the government.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena leadership then started talks with the NCP and the Congress, and this effort concluded today.</p>
