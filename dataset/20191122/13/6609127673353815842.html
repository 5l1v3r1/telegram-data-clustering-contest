      <p>Those who were lucky enough to get their hands on tickets are starting to sell them on sites like Viagogo.</p>
      <p>And some are going for almost £600.</p>
      <p>Tickets officially went on sale this morning at 9am, priced £60.50 - but are being re-sold for much more.</p>

      <p>Posting on Twitter, Mrs Broony Said: "Can someone tell me why this is allowed? Blatantly ripping off fans.</p>
      <p>"So many genuine fans like myself desperate to get tickets to see the killers in Falkirk stadium only for it to be sold out in seconds &amp; reselling for triple the price on sites like</p>
      <p>viagogo worse than touts".</p>
      <p>Some people have also expressed outrage at being held in queues for more then 15 minutes only to find tickets had sold out.</p>
      <p>Another said: "Gutted not to get tickets for Killers for Falkirk or Bristol - was on ticket master before 9am - how did it end up like this!</p>
      <p>"Will have to console myself with an armchair disco tonight blastin Killer’s tunes".</p>
      <p>We've contacted Ticketmaster and Viagogo for comment.</p>
