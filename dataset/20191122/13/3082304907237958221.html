        <b>Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane has asked fans to continue backing Gareth Bale, despite the latter’s controversial flag celebration after Wales qualified to the UEFA Euro Cup 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“There is a lot of noise because of Bale’s gestures but in the end, the most important thing is football,” Zidane said in the pre-match press conference on Friday, ahead of Real Madrid’s La Liga fixture against Real Sociedad on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Regarding Bale, I am just going to look at the sporting side, not what happens outside.”</p>
      <p>“He is a part of our team. You don’t have to look at anything else. People have to be with Bale because he is with us. He is fine and has trained normally.”</p>
      <p>“Bale said he was more comfortable with Wales just because of the language. He is comfortable in the locker room.”</p>
      <p>“‘I saw Bale very happy after the goal in the Champions League final, and he did it with Madrid,” the Frenchman further added, before concluding:</p>
      <p>“He can be a decisive player again and he’s going to prove it. I just think about that.”</p>
      <p>“Bale does not like us to talk about him like that. He thinks it is too much.”</p>
