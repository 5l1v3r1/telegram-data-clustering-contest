      <h2>Cristiano worries Mairead when he starts panicking over a small accident</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:07:53+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:07</time> by <a rel="author">Michelle Townsend</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fair-city">Fair City</a> fans were shocked last night as Will turned even nastier and punished Cristiano for making Mairead uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>The drama starts when Cristiano makes a huge effort for Mairead, but Will twists it for his own agenda.</p>
      <p>Will rewards Cristiano for his compliant behaviour, however Cristiano remains uneasy over his relentless nastiness towards Damien, <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/news/tv-film/punishes-cristiano-making-mairead-uncomfortable-20924111">RSVP Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Cristiano worries Mairead when he starts panicking over a small accident - and Will is thrown off when Mairead suggests Cristiano was afraid of him and how he would react.</p>

      <p>This sadly only makes things worse for Cristiano, as Will punishes him for making Mairead question him.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere on Fair City, Ray is completely taken aback when Doug tells him he is moving to Galway permanently.</p>
      <p>Emotions run high as Ray gives Doug a final piece of advice as they share a fond farewell - and it’s not long before the lads start to miss him.</p>
      <p>All of that, plus Hughie is disappointed in Bob and Renee’s lack of faith in him and Hayley shares a tender moment with Sharon.</p>
