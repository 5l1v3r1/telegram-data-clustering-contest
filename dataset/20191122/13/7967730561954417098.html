      <h1>Airbnb and Airtasker popular with criminals 'to create an air of legitimacy'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sally Rawsthorne and Nigel Gladstone</a></address>
      <p>Criminals are increasingly using tools such as Airbnb rentals, Airtasker and Gumtree to camouflage drug dealing as legitimate businesses.</p>
      <p>Three recent NSW Crime Commission investigations involved courier companies delivering drugs to Sydney Airbnb rentals with separate lock-up garages for the storage of drugs, according to the organisation's latest annual report.</p>

      <p>Mexican national Norma Zuniga Frias, 26, was sentenced in July to at least four-and-a-half years' jail for attempting to import more than 15 kilograms of ice hidden in Sony speakers. She was charged along with her then girlfriend, Bondi woman Rose Thomas.</p>
      <p>Zuniga Frias booked multiple Airbnb rentals for the delivery of the ice, which was ultimately intercepted by the Australian Federal Police and replaced by an inert substance.</p>
      <p>After the package was delivered to an Airbnb rental, Zuniga Frias was arrested, charged with attempting to import a commercial amount of ice and sent to prison, where she will remain until at least December 2022.</p>
      <p>She was to be paid $15,000 for her role in importing drugs to Australia – the cost of a partner visa she needed to stay in Australia.</p>

      <p>Thomas, the daughter of publishing mogul Jackie Maxted, was spared prison and instead sentenced to a two-year intensive corrective order for her limited role in the attempted import of $13.9 million worth of ice.</p>
      <p>In another instance cited by the Crime Commission, a syndicate rented a rural property to create a clandestine laboratory.</p>
      <p>"The property was known to be used for Airbnb, so nearby residents did not consider the attendance of unknown persons and vehicles to be out of the ordinary," the report said.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, a meth lab was allegedly set up in an Adelaide Airbnb rental 24 hours after check-in.</p>
      <p>South Australian police arrested Andreas Panas and Ross Linke when the property, which had been rented for five days, caught fire.</p>
      <p>The men remain before the courts.</p>
      <p>An Airbnb spokesperson said the company has zero tolerance for criminal activity and has banned anyone “found to be affiliated with a dangerous association” from the platform.</p>
      <p>“We will always act decisively to support authorities to ensure those who break the law are held to account.”</p>
      <p>As well as using short-term rentals, criminal groups are increasingly acting like legitimate operations and using business mainstays such as serviced offices, parcel pick-up lockers and telephone forwarding services, the report said.</p>
      <p>They are also using fake identities to open bank accounts, rent storage units, generate ABNs and create companies "to create an air of legitimacy", as well as mixing contraband deliveries in with legitimate ones and moving a high volume of stock between locations to make finding drug deliveries more difficult.</p>
