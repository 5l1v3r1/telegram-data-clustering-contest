      <p>To be the very best, it helps to have powerful Pokémon with powerful attacks. Some of the best moves in the game have to be taught to your Pokémon. The best way to do that is to acquire a Technical Machine (TM). There are 86 TMs total in Pokémon Sword and Shield. Some of these can be purchased while others are hidden all throughout the Galar region. Here are all of the TMs in Pokémon Sword and Shield along with where you'll find them.</p>
