          <b>Warning: spoilers ahead for the finale of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK.</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>The Vivienne had her fair share of run-ins with the other queens as she battled to be crowned winner of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK.</p>
      <p>But it turns out she had some pretty sweet moments that we never got to see.</p>
      <p>The Drag Race UK winner has revealed she was the one to suggest that Cheryl Hole stick a piece of toilet paper to her heel while emulating the stereotypical Essex girl on the runway.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Metro.co.uk after the final, The Vivienne claimed that she helped out the queens a lot, but none of it made it into the edit.</p>

      <p>The 27-year-old said: ‘If you say something bitchy, you said something bitchy and that’s what’s going to be on TV. But we didn’t get to see the softer side of me. I did so much for the other queens that never got shown or even mentioned by the other queens, but hey-ho… I’m gonna say it. On episode one, when Cheryl got all the praise for putting the toilet roll on her shoe as the Essex girl, I told her to do that before she went out on the runway.</p>

      <p>‘I styled Blu’s hair, I styled Cheryl’s hair, I gave Crystal the big orbs for the sewing challenge. I did so much which never got shown, which was a shame, but at least I kind of came round on the last few episodes and showed I’m not a complete cold-hearted b****.’</p>
      <p>But unlike many queens before her, Viv isn’t blaming the edit for her portrayal.</p>

      <p>The Scouser said: ‘I’d never say blame the edit. I said everything I said. Sometimes a couple of laughs or winks were cut off things I said which maybe changed it a little bit, but we’re drag queens for god’s sake. And I think compared to the US show, we were very tame, we were nice.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/drag-race-uk-winner-rupaul-vivienne-baga-chipz-divina-dicampo-11197257/">The Vivienne was crowned the first ever winner of Drag Race UK</a>, beating Divina De Campo and Baga Chipz to the title.</p>
      <p>And as multiple endings are filmed for the final, to avoid the result being leaked, she found out she had won along with the rest of us.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘No, I didn’t know until we sat down and watched it. It was me, Divina and Baga watching it with Alan [Carr], Michelle [Visage] and family. Once you see that reaction clip, it’s pretty evident that we didn’t have a clue.’</p>

      <p>While the US series offers a $100,000 cash prize, The Vivienne has won the chance to create her own digital series in Hollywood.</p>
      <p>When asked if she’s a bit disappointed that she’s not £100k richer, Viv laughed: ‘I mean, of course. But you know, we’ll make that in a couple of months. It’s all about the opportunities afterwards.</p>
      <p>‘It would have been nice to hit Vivienne Westwood this morning, but never mind.’</p>
