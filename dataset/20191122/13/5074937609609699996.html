      <h1>Decent jobs key to fighting poverty - Dr Gubalo</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:39:28+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:39</time> by <a rel="author">Hafsa Obeng, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov 22, GNA – Dr Madina Guloba, Senior Research Fellow, Economic Policy Research Centre, Uganda has said that the creation of decent jobs in the context of an industrialised, green economy was a key foundation for the fight against poverty and the creation of equitable societies in Africa.</p>
      <p>She said in spite of the sound macroeconomic performance (economic growth) of African economies, real structural transformation and decent jobs were not realised and this did not translate into development and poverty alleviation.</p>
      <p>Dr Guloba made the observation when she delivered a communique at the end of the regional conference on economic transformation, decent work and green economy held in Accra to commemorate the African Industrialisation day, 2019.</p>
      <p>The three day conference was organised by the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change (AYICC), the Trades Union Congress (TUC-Ghana) and the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES-Ghana).</p>
      <p>The conference which draws its participants from all regions in Africa, was aimed at stimulating debates on the impacts of industrialization on the global and African environment, discussing how green transformation could secure and promote decent work for all and discussing the impact of green policies on the African labour market.</p>
      <p>She said economic transformation was a key potential for addressing the key socio-economic challenges of the African continent, youth unemployment, poverty, inequality, poor revenue collection, rising public debt, high and growing trade deficits.</p>
      <p>“Africa is well-endowed with varied forms of resources that could be tapped to transform the continent and also create decent jobs for the teeming youth and other jobseekers.”</p>
      <p>Dr Guloba said the industrial sector, especially manufacturing, was on the decline in many African countries and if the situation was not addressed and tackled, the future looked  bleak.</p>
      <p>“It is estimated that by 2050, Africa will have 362 million young people between the ages of 15 and 24 years old translating to the continent having the highest young people, thus the resultant effect is a growing population of more educated and urbanised youth struggling for few existing jobs.”</p>
      <p>She noted that the global economy was fast changing and required that African must industrialise and their economies, transformed if they wanted to be relevant in the global value and wealth chains.</p>
      <p>She said it was not too late for economic transformation of African economies to occur, but the modern dynamics were different and therefore required modern approaches that were inclusive, and environmentally friendly and sustainable.</p>
      <p>“The rationale is that the process of economic transformation today (21st century) could not be the same as the 19th century in the midst of the phenomenon of climatic change and its impacts on the environment and human life.”</p>
      <p>“We need an economic transformation that is reflective of the limits of the earth and what it can provide for us and for future generations and this by necessity must be just.  Such an approach should transform the economic structures, be inclusive, and preserve the environment for the generations unborn.”</p>
      <p>Dr Guloba said the conference recommended that globally, a just transition must be at the locus of economic transformation in the global economy.</p>
      <p>“Decent work is central to the transformation process. The only way economic transformation can reflect positively in the lives of people globally is when it leads to creation of decent jobs. All work is dignified work, must be respected, and recognised. It must not be based on a minimum wage, but a living wage.”</p>
      <p>She said Africa needed economic transformation that was premised on industrialisation, especially manufacturing of goods that are locally produced and consumed. Industrial trajectories must critically examine the possibility of moving away from extractivism and exploring the alternative options of industrialisation.</p>
      <p>“There is an urgent need for review of existing tariff and tax systems that will favour the development and growth of local industries.</p>
      <p>Nationally, she noted that economic transformation must be driven by a strong state participation, state institutions must be strengthened through government support and adequate resources especially labour market and related institutions.</p>
      <p>“There is the need to harmonise laws and policies to promote economic transformation and a just transition in African economies. Governments across the African continent must find ways to promote youth digital innovation using green approaches.”</p>
