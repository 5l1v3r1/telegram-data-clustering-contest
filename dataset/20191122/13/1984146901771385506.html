      <p>He's proved to be a hugely popular contestant on this year's Strictly Come Dancing and Chris Ramsey earned some new fans last week after eagle eyed viewers were drawn to something other than his fancy footwork.</p>
      <p>South Shields comedian <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/chris-ramsey">Chris</a> is definitely one of the most improved celebs on the new series of the hit BBC show and, together with pro partner Karen Hauer, has been delighting viewers with routines including a Charleston to Take That and a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/chris-ramsey-lets-get-rhumble-17191618">Couple's Choice to PJ &amp; Duncan</a> - which will live long in our memories!</p>
      <p>Last Saturday, Chris &amp; Karen opened Strictly's Blackpool spectacular with a Salsa to Uptown Funk and while Chris' dancing was mightily impressive, earning him a 33/40, there was something else that sparked a bit of a frenzy.</p>
      <p>After the dust had settled on what was a spectacular night of dancing, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly</a> fans were talking about something else...namely Chris' bulge, with one tweeting "Completely distracted by Chris's crotch."</p>
      <p>His wife Rosie even got on the act. Uploading a zoomed in screen grab of Chris in some VERY tight pink trousers, she joked "You guys didn’t think I married him for his personality did you?!?! . Oh you did?? .. That’s embarrassing."</p>
      <p>Rosie was actually referenced in another fan tweet, with someone posting "Rosie is a lucky woman."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/strictly-chris-ramsey-bulge-twitter-17276209">The bulge even has it's own Twitter account.</a> Called Chris Ramsey's Bulge, with the handle @BulgeChris, the account's bio reads "I am the monster which lurks inside the undergarments of Chris ‘The Package’ Ramsey and I am a grower."</p>

      <p>And speaking to Chroniclelive ahead of Saturday night's Strictly live show, a very modest Chris shed some light on the picture that caused a social media storm.</p>
      <p>"The whole day I'd been telling everyone that the trousers were extremely tight, I even said to someone 'if I sit down in these I'll ruin my chances of having another kid!'</p>
      <p>"So the team put an extra bit of fabric in the trousers to make it more comfortable for me. I can only think that it bunched up during the dance.</p>
      <p>"Rosie had a field day with it; she knows I get so embarrassed about that kind of thing. I can't believe it even got it's own Twitter account!"</p>
