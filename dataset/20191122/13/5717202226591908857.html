      <p><a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/11866959/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-unmoved-by-mauricio-pochettino-availability">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been quoted by Sky Sports</a> as saying that Nemanja Matic has a sense of humour after the Manchester United man was caught commenting on a post that suggested he could join Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <p>Matic, 31, is in the final year of his contract at Old Trafford after being signed by Mourinho at both Chelsea and then at Manchester United. The Serbia international cost United a whopping £40million (<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/07/30/manchester-united-verge-announcing-40m-nemanja-matic-signing/">Telegraph</a>) in 2017.</p>
      <p>With Mourinho joining Tottenham, fans immediately suggested that the Portuguese gaffer would turn to Matic for a third time – especially with the ex-Benfica star’s £120,000-a-week (<a href="https://www.spotrac.com/epl/manchester-united-f.c/payroll/">Spotrac</a>) contract set to expire at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Renowned football account Benchwarmers uploaded a jokey post suggesting that Mourinho is waiting to target Matic in January, and the United midfielder responded – immediately suggesting that their is a chance of a reunion at Spurs.</p>

      <p>Spurs have plenty of options in midfield – especially after completing the signing of Tanguy Ndombele from Lyon in the summer. Eric Dier, Harry Winks and Moussa Sissoko are also able to play, while Victor Wanyama is on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>Manchester United manager Solskjaer was asked about any potential truth behind a Spurs move for Matic in the January window, but the Norwegian played his comment down – claiming that the Serbian had a sense of humour.</p>
      <p>“When it’s like this, you like Jose coming back. It’s going to be a spectacle and a circus and Nemanja has a sense of humour,” Solskjaer said. It looks as though Matic is staying put, for now.</p>
