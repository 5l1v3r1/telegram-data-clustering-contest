      <p>Google's <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2893364/chrome-os/is-chrome-os-right-for-you.html">Chrome OS</a> platform sure has come a long way.</p>
      <p>From the early days, when Chrome OS was little more than an experimental "<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2469895/windows-pcs/google-s-chrome-os-notebook--my-first-impressions.html">browser in a box</a>," to today — with the platform powering first-class hardware and supporting a diverse range of productivity applications — Google's once-crazy-seeming project has turned into one of the world's most intriguing and rapidly expanding technological forces.</p>
      <p>I've been covering Chrome OS closely since the start. I lived with the first Chromebook prototype, the Cr-48, and have used Chromebooks as part of my own personal computing setup in varying capacities ever since. I write about the field not only as someone who's studied it professionally from day 1 but also as someone who has used it personally that entire time, up through today.</p>
      <p>So whether you're relatively new to the realm of Chrome OS or are a Chromebook veteran yourself, I'm happy to join you on your journey and act as your guide. On this page, you'll find all my latest Chrome OS coverage — the original analysis, the tips 'n' tricks, and everything in between. I'll be updating it regularly as new subjects come up, so check back often and stay ahead of the curve with your Chromebook knowledge.</p>
