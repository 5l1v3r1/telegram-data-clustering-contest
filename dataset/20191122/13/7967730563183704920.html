      <h1>Australian love story at the heart of Bougainville's push for independence</h1>

      <p><b>Arawa:</b> “Box 2, Box 2!” they shout, honking horns as open-backed trucks laden with villagers rumble along dusty roads leading into the old capital Arawa. Flags adorn car aerials and are waved by exuberant young men out of car windows in the days leading up to today’s referendum vote.</p>
      <p>They are referring to “box 2” on the ballot cards which signifies a vote for independence for Bougainville. Box 1 is a vote for “greater autonomy” within Papua New Guinea.</p>

      <p>Rain had not dampened the enthusiasm for a large “sing sing” and final rally at the main oval in Arawa yesterday, with fiery speeches given by former BRA commanders Ishmael Torama and Chris Uma calling on people to “don’t be Judas” and “vote for your future, vote box 2”.</p>
      <p>Today many of Bougainville’s 206,000 eligible voters are moving towards one of 800 polling stations across the territory on its first day of voting. The two-week ballot period ends on December 7 with results expected before December 20.</p>
      <p>It marks the culmination of a nine-year war (1988-1997) which cost 20,000 lives and a 20 year peace process leading to this day when locals can peacefully vote. The referendum is non-binding and requires a “negotiated outcome” between the Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG) and central government in Port Moresby.</p>

      <p>Although it is expected a clear majority will opt for independence, there are some who are still unsure how they will vote on the day. One of them is Raymond, a taxi driver in the northern town of Buka, who spoke to <i>The Herald</i> and <i>The Age</i> outside the main market earlier this week.</p>
      <p>“Some of us in Buka have bad memories from the war and the BRAs (pro-independence guerrillas) who came up here. I’m still deciding which way to vote because I’m worried about having basic services here if we vote for independence.”</p>
      <p>One of those also voting in Buka today has no doubt which way she will vote: box 2 for independence. Marilyn Havini, nee Miller, grew up in Sydney in the 1960s but ended up meeting her future husband Moses Havini when both attended a Christian conference at Monash university in Melbourne in 1967. Like many revolutions, theirs is a love story at its heart.</p>

      <p>Moses was a handsome chief from Australian-administered Buka, north of Bougainville, who was editing a student newspaper while studying law at the university of PNG. Marilyn was a Queens Guide and Sea Ranger selected by her church to also attend the conference.</p>
      <p>“He asked me for art work and material for his newsletter and that’s how it all began” she says with a smile. “We were both attracted to each other immediately”.</p>
      <p>Now 72, Marilyn wasn’t to know then the years of struggle ahead; from being shunned by those with colonial-era attitudes at a time mixed-marriages were frowned upon, to the bitter war years and exile in Australia, where Moses became the main international representative for Bougainville’s pro-independence government.</p>
      <p>“We were lucky we both had the support of our parents and families and over time we came to be accepted by both communities”.</p>

      <p>It was Moses I first met in 1994, who helped organise my own trip into rebel Bougainville, running the naval blockade via the “backdoor” of the Solomon Islands to report on what was then the most intense conflict in the south Pacific since WWII.</p>

      <p>In 1974, Marilyn, then a high school art teacher in Arawa, won a national competition to design a Bougainville flag. This was not long before Bougainville attempted to pre-empt rule from Port Moresby with its first declaration of independence two weeks before PNG became independent from Australia in September 1975. This first UDI went unrecognised but her flag remains the flag of Bougainville today.</p>
      <p>“Actually I helped with the final design only after consulting the kastom chiefs to make sure it was culturally appropriate and inclusive of everyone in the region, since it couldn’t reflect just one of our cultures,” she explains. At its centre is Bougainville’s most recognisable symbol: an “Upe" hat, traditionally worn by young men as they emerge from their initiation ceremonies.</p>
      <p>Although her husband Moses passed away in 2015 before he had a chance to vote for independence in today’s referendum, Mrs Havini believes he will be remembered as one of Bougainville’s pioneering leaders and a founding father.</p>
      <p>“He was a statesman, not a politician, always looking to serve the cause of his people rather than seek power” she reflects today. “His models were Nelson Mandela and Gandhi”. The family had four children, including Taloi, now an internationally-recognised artist with an upcoming solo show as part of the 2020 Sydney Festival.</p>
      <p>Also voting today is the ABG’s current President John Momis, a former Catholic priest and PNG ambassador who has also been part of Bougainville’s long road to nationhood. He might be the only man in history considered a founding father of two nations - he helped write PNG’s constitution and served that nation for many decades before deciding as Bougainville president that it was time Bougainville also join the family of nations.</p>

      <p>Observer teams from various organisations including the UN and Pacific Islands Forum, along with several MPs from Australia led by Jane Prentice, are on the ground monitoring what is so far being deemed a “free and fair” referendum in a peaceful atmosphere of celebration.</p>
      <p>Bougainville’s next challenge is whether the expected result for independence gets ratified by the PNG Parliament.</p>
