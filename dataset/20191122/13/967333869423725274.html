      <p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201911171077328831-victorias-secret-angels-might-dissolved-soon/">Victoria's Secret has scrapped its annual fashion show</a>, L Brands Chief Financial Officer Stuart Burgdoerfer stated during an earnings call on Thursday.</p>
      <blockquote>"We're figuring out how to advance the positioning of the brand and best communicate that to customers", he explained, adding that the show was "an important aspect of the brand and a remarkable marketing achievement".</blockquote>
      <p>The statement comes after L Brands recently reported a net loss of $252mln in third-quarter results. At the same time, the lingerie brand is facing several controversies,<a href="https://sputniknews.com/photo/201911181077339423/"> including possible cancellation of the Angels</a> - its most elite group of contracted models, which has included Tyra Banks, Heidi Klum, and Miranda Kerr.</p>

      <p>The traditional annual fashion event was launched by the brand in 1995, featuring top supermodels wearing various outfits. The show, however, has lost many viewers over the past decades – according to ABC, only 3.3 million Americans watched it last December (compared with 12 million in 2001, when it was first broadcast in the US).</p>
