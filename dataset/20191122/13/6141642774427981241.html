      <p>Plaid Cymru has made a multi-billion investment programme its key pledge in its General Election manifesto following its launch on Friday.</p>
      <p>The party say it will create tens of thousands of new jobs across Wales with a £20 billion investment into renewable energy, digital technology and transport infrastructure, with the added aim of making the country carbon and single-use plastic free by 2030.</p>
      <p>Projects include the electrification of all mainline rail lines and Valleys railways, a metro system, the construction of tidal lagoons in Swansea Bay, Cardiff, and Colwyn Bay, an offshore windfarm near Ynys Mon, a barrage on the River Usk, and the construction of 20,000 green social houses.</p>

      <p>The party has also prioritised social care, promising free care for the elderly and vulnerable people through a National Health and Social Care Service.</p>
      <p>It says an additional 1,000 new doctors, 5,000 new nurses, and 100 new NHS dentists would offer “seamless access to health and care for everyone throughout Wales.”</p>
      <p>A “fair deal for families” would offer universal free childcare for 40 hours a week, and a £35 a week payment for every child in a low income household, which they say will lift 50,000 children out of poverty.</p>

      <p>Plaid has also pledged to combat crime, with the creation of a Welsh justice system, policing devolved to Wales, and a crime prevention fund to recruit 1,600 new police officers and at least two for every community.</p>
      <p>Other key points of the manifesto include having a “final say referendum” on EU membership, a Welsh migration advisory service to plug skills gaps with migrants, devolution of the welfare system, cancelling plans for the £5 billion restoration of the Palace of Westminster, and a decision of going to war requiring support of all four nations of the UK.</p>
