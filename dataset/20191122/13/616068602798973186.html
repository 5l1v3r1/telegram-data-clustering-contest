      <p>Tolko Industries announced more job losses Friday.</p>
      <p>Castanet was sent a message from Brad Thorlakson, president and CEO of Tolko Industries, to employees stating more jobs are being cut.</p>
      <p>“Today we announce the elimination of 44 positions within woodlands, operations and the Vernon office,” Thorlakson said in the message.</p>
      <p>“The decision was made after a long and careful review of the options, realizing that many good people would be affected.”</p>
      <p>Market conditions were cited as the reason for the cuts.</p>
      <p>“It is a tough day, but we believe we have right-sized the organization,” said Thorlakson. “We may still have short-term adjustments, but long term we now have the resources to match our footprint in B.C.”</p>
      <p>The cuts are the latest blow to the besieged forestry giant that has been struggling with high costs and a poor market.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Tolko announced the <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/270094/tolko-shutdown-permanent">closure of its Kelowna operation</a>, putting close to 200 people out of work.</p>
      <p>Tolko also <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Vernon/270512/more-bad-news-from-tolko">announced slow downs</a> at all of its BC operations Dec. 21 to Jan. 6.</p>
      <p>Castanet was also told the CN Rail strike is making it difficult for Tolko to ship its product.</p>
      <p>When contacted by Castanet, a spokesperson for the company refused to comment on the situation.</p>
