      <h1>How to address a history of short-term jobs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:01:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:01</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Munro</a></address>
      <p>Need to explain a history of short-term roles on your resume?</p>
      <p>Well, first, you’ll need to have an idea about what a short-term job actually looks like. While some people might think of "short term" as a two or three-month contract, others might see it as being two or three years.</p>

      <p>The good news is that the average time employers consider "short-tenure" is seven months. And with 80 per cent of Australians employed in their current role for over a year, the idea that anything less than 12 months is short-term probably stacks up.</p>
      <p>It’s also important to understand how many jobs are too many and why you should address this when applying for a role.</p>
      <p>Three short-term jobs might qualify someone as a "job-hopper", and – unfortunately – 76 per cent of employers decide not to interview a candidate they consider to be a job-hopper, according to research conducted on behalf of Indeed.</p>
      <p>So, if you have more than three short-term jobs on your resume, you may have some explaining to do to turn an employer’s perceptions around.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, there are many positive reasons for moving around in your career, such as exposure to<br/>different projects, industries, and learning new ways of working. It’s possible to gain a broad<br/>base of core skills including adaptability, strong communication and the ability to learn quickly as a result of multiple jobs in a short time-frame.</p>
      <p>It’s important to address your short-term jobs in a positive light as this will be key to helping you<br/>secure a new role. It’s also worth identifying which jobs, if any, were contract roles. The popularity<br/>of contract positions in today’s workplace means your recruiter might be more aware of the benefits<br/>of these short-term roles compared to ones you’ve left by choice.</p>
      <p>When applying for a new job, include a cover letter that explains your motivations for having multiple short-term roles and how these experiences have equipped you for the position advertised.</p>
      <p>Being proactive at the beginning of the search will help you overcome the challenges you may<br/>face getting an interview. Call the employer a day or two after submitting your application to positively explain your history of short tenures while addressing any concerns they might have.</p>
      <p>If you secure an interview, go the extra mile by following up the next day to thank them for their<br/>time and summarise all the key attributes you could bring to their organisation. If you’ve come this<br/>far, you’ve probably done enough to address your history of short-term jobs, so switch the focus to<br/>your unique skills and suitability for the role.</p>
      <p>While it’s important to address your history of short-term jobs, don’t dwell on it too much. Instead,<br/>throughout the application process, use your past experiences to demonstrate what you’ve gained<br/>from those roles and how you’ll apply your learnings in the new role.</p>
