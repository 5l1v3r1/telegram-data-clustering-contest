      <p>The Sixers partner also gave six figures to #Change4Change.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>The hosts of <i>The Breakfast Club</i> held their annual #Change4Change fundraiser on November 21. Angela Yee, DJ Envy, and Charlamagne Tha God collected more than $670,000 for HBCU scholarships through the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.</p>
      <p>Philadelphia 76ers partner Michael Rubin was among the many celebrities to donate to #Change4Change. He actually announced his $125,000 contribution during a recent appearance on <i>The Breakfast Club</i>.</p>
      <p>Rubin initially pledged $100,000. The Kynetic founder later offered to raise it to $125K if Envy and Charlamagne agreed to wear a Sixers jersey once a week on the Power 105.1 radio and Revolt television show.</p>
      <p>While appearing on the program, Rubin also revealed that he and Philadelphia rapper Robert "Meek Mill" Williams were committed to giving "millions of dollars" to Pennsylvania schools in 2019. The two friends also serve as Co-Chairs of the REFORM Alliance. The nonprofit organization's mission is to fight to change the laws, policies, and practices that perpetuate injustice in America. </p>
      <p>Additionally, Rubin and Williams recently <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/meek-mill-sixers-partner-michael-rubin-visit-man-imprisoned-for-being-poor-5x1vvwDKqESYM3BSiP5avg/">met with Maurice Hudson in a Pennsylvania prison</a>. Hudson was sentenced to 1½ to 3 years because he was unable to pay $1,941 in outstanding court costs. According to Rubin, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted Hudson his release this week.</p>
