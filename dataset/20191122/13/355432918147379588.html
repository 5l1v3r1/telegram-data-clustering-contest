      <h1>Army taking security assessment of TikTok after Schumer warning</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:26:16+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rachel-frazin" target="_blank">Rachel Frazin</a></address>
      <p>The Army is taking a security assessment of the social media app TikTok after Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-army/army-examines-tiktok-security-concerns-after-schumers-data-warning-idUSKBN1XV2N6">raised concerns about</a> the Chinese company. </p>
      <p>Army Secretary <a href="https://thehill.com/people/ryan-mccarthy">Ryan McCarthy</a> told reporters Thursday that he ordered the assessment after Schumer asked him to probe potential risks associated with the video-sharing app, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-army/army-examines-tiktok-security-concerns-after-schumers-data-warning-idUSKBN1XV2N6">Reuters</a>. </p>
      <p>Schumer recently wrote to McCarthy, particularly expressing concern about Army personnel use of the app, including as a tactic to recruit new soldiers. </p>
      <p>"While I recognize that the Army must adapt its recruiting techniques in order to attract young Americans to serve, I urge you to assess the potential national security risks posed by China-owned technology companies before choosing to utilize certain platforms," the senator wrote.</p>
      <p>The top Democrat and others have also previously expressed concerns about the social media platform. </p>
      <p>Last month, Schumer and Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/tom-cotton">Tom Cotton</a> (R-Ark.) asked intelligence officials to look into whether TikTok poses <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/467280-schumer-cotton-request-tiktok-security-assessment">"national security risks.”</a></p>
      <p>"Security experts have voiced concerns that China’s vague patchwork of intelligence, national security, and cybersecurity laws compel Chinese companies to support and cooperate with intelligence work controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," the lawmakers wrote to acting Director of National Intelligence <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joseph-maguire">Joseph Maguire</a>.</p>
      <p>TikTok is an immensely popular app among young people in the U.S. and worldwide. The Hill has reached out to the platform for comment. </p>
