      <h1>GSMA hails WRC-19 5G spectrum agreement</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:30:07+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#chrisdonkin" target="_blank">Chris Donkin</a></address>
      <p>The GSMA lauded an international treaty identifying spectrum needed to deliver ultra-high speed and low latency 5G services agreed at the ITU’s World Radiocommuncation Conference 2019 (WRC-19) in Egypt.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the industry group welcomed the decision at WRC-19 to define several mmWave frequencies for use in deploying 5G networks, explaining it would help open “game changing” 5G applications across the globe.</p>
      <p>The decision to identify 26GHz, 40GHz and 66GHz ranges for 5G was confirmed by the ITU at the climax of the four-week long WRC-19 conference, held in Sharm El-Sheikh between 28 October and today (22 November).</p>
      <p>5G use cases expected to be delivered over the identified frequencies include virtual and augmented reality applications, remote control of industrial robots, autonomous vehicles and consumer entertainment services.</p>
      <p>GSMA director general Mats Granryd said: “Countries struck the right balance in opening up groundbreaking possibilities for 5G while protecting existing radio services worldwide.</p>
      <p>“The mobile industry’s goal going into WRC-19 was to identify enough 5G spectrum to deliver long-lasting socio-economic benefits. WRC-19 delivered on this goal, and also secured a pathway to 5G’s future success in the agenda for WRC-23 [the next edition of the conference].”</p>
