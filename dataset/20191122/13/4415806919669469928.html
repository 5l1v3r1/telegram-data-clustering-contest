      <h1>A quarter of people in Northern Ireland not registered to vote, Electoral Commission says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:17:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>One in four people in Northern Ireland are not registered to vote, the Electoral Commission said.</p>
      <p>The body said 26% of all those eligible to vote in the region have not registered.</p>
      <p>Research from the commission also indicates that young people and those who have recently moved house are most likely to be incorrectly registered.</p>
      <p>The final deadline to register to vote before the December 12 General Election is next Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Cahir Hughes, head of the Electoral Commission, Northern Ireland, has encouraged those not registered to vote to do so.</p>
      <p>“As we get closer to the election, it is vital that everyone in Northern Ireland is able to have their say, and they must be registered by Tuesday (November 26),” he said.</p>
      <p>“It only takes five minutes to register to vote online – time that you might otherwise spend waiting for the kettle to boil or for a bus to arrive. So if you want to make sure your voice is heard and you’re not already registered, go online and register now.”</p>
      <p>A person can register to vote in December’s General Election if they are aged 18 or over on polling day and a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizen resident in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>Anyone wanting to vote must be registered by November 26.</p>
