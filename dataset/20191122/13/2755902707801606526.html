      <p>The National Day of Prayer is the brainchild of the First Lady, and the inaugural event was launched on October 21, 2019.</p>

      <p>Just like at the <a href="https://iharare.com/pics-first-lady-breaks-down-sheds-tears-over-sanctions-during-prayer/">previous iteration of the National Day of Prayer at the State House, the First Lady Auxilia Mnangagwa broke down in tears</a>, apparently, after she was touched by the plight of Zimbabwe and its citizens.</p>
      <p>During today’s event, the First Lady announced that from January 2020 onwards, the National Day of Prayer will be held in the country’s provinces to allow people to participate at the provincial level.</p>
