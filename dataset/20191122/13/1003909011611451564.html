      <h1>Preview: On and off the stage, Last Christmas about family ties</h1>

      <p>Neil Fleming would like to make two things very clear about his play, Last Christmas, which runs at Lunchbox Theatre until Dec. 21.</p>
      <p>It does not feature a soundtrack of George Michael tunes as is the case with the holiday romance movie of the same title currently playing in theatres and, most emphatically, this is not his family on stage.</p>
      <p>“My family members are all still alive so I worked very hard not to portray them in any of the characters. I don’t want to alienate them or have them sue me, so I want to make it clear this is very much not my family,” says Fleming, who wrote Last Christmas in 2010 on commission from Pamela Halstead, who was the company’s artistic director at the time.</p>
      <p>“Pamela asked me to write a Christmas show so I pitched her the idea of Christmas with a dysfunctional family. My first draft was really weird so Pamela asked me to tone it down a little,” says Fleming, who adds one of the inspirations for the family dynamic came from a friend in Vancouver who worked at a medical marijuana dispensary.</p>
      <p>“She said it felt so weird having to teach seniors how to role a joint so I wanted that to be part of my show. That’s why I made Grandpa terminally ill so this will be his last Christmas, hence the title of the show. His condition is the reason his two daughters, who do not get along, are home for Christmas.”</p>
      <p>While the siblings quarrel, Grandpa and his grandson Riley share a couple of joints.</p>
      <p>In its original incarnation at Lunchbox, Fleming’s Last Christmas was a major hit, which is why the company’s current artistic director, Shari Wattling, brought it back and why she is directing it.</p>
      <p>None of the original cast has returned for the new production but there is a connection. Back in 2011, Karen Johnson-Diamond played one of the feuding sisters. Now, her son Griffin Cork plays the grandson Riley.</p>
      <p>“Karen and I are longtime friends. I would visit her often and I can still remember Griffin as a 10-year-old doing standup comedy at one of Karen’s birthdays,” said Fleming. “He’s perfect (as) Riley, who is also pretty unconventional.”</p>
      <p>Last Christmas was so popular with audiences that Halstead encouraged Fleming to flesh it out into a two-act comedy.</p>
      <p>“That extended version has never played in Calgary, but it has played in Saskatchewan, Newfoundland, and in my home town of Sault St. Marie. I flew down to see their version with my family members.”</p>
      <p>Fleming says theatre is in his blood.</p>
      <p>“My parents were members of a musical theatre company for more than 50 years. My dad is turning 80 and he’s playing Gus the Theatre Cat in that theatre company’s production of Cats.”</p>
      <p>Fleming says his original foray into theatre in high school was working on the technical side such as lighting and sound and getting props.</p>
      <p>“My dad recruited me to be a chorus member in the musicals, so I did a big stint on stage but the technical aspect of theatre has always been my real passion.”</p>
      <p>Fleming has just been hired as resident technical director at Lunchbox Theatre and his first duty was designing the set and lights for Last Christmas. He will be running lights and sound for the production’s run.</p>
      <p>Last Christmas opens Nov. 23 at 7:30 p.m. in Lunchbox’s theatre at the base of the Calgary Tower and runs Mondays through Saturdays at noon and on Thursdays and Fridays at 6 p.m. until Dec. 21.</p>
