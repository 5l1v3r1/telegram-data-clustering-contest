      <p>It is said there was tension between supporters of both teams and this has caused both of them to throw bottles at each other. This action was then repeated when Mr. Safawi Rashid scored a goal for Harimau Malaya at the 30-minute mark.</p>

      <p>The secretary of the Indonesian Sports Ministry, Gatot S Dewa Broto said,</p>
      <blockquote>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never received any phone calls or letters from the Malaysian Sports Ministry concerning the incident that happened that day. At least give us an explanation and apologise la.‚Äù<br/>‚ÄúNo matter if the¬†incident is big or small, the Malaysian Sports Ministry needs to send a letter to us.‚Äù</blockquote>
      <p>Mr. Gatot also said that he has received a few reports from the Indonesian supporters that were present that day saying that they had been involuntarily dragged into the chaos and have asked the ministry to do something about it.</p>
      <p>The Indonesian Sports Ministry is now considering lodging an official complaint with world football regulatory body FIFA.</p>
