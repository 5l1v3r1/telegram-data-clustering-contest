      <h2>Aston Villa v Newcastle United | Jack Grealish has missed his side's past three matches in all competitions with Monday's night's clash with Newcastle United looming</h2>

        <sup>Aston Villa head coach Dean Smith has offered an injury update on Jack Grealish ahead of Monday night's Premier League clash with Newcastle United (8pm).</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jack-grealish">Grealish</a> has missed the past three matches in all competitions for Villa after suffering a calf injury in the 3-0 defeat to Manchester City in October.</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup>He sat out a Carabao Cup win over <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> and Premier League losses to Wolves and Liverpool.</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup>Before he picked up his injury he was in fine form, netting in back-to-back wins over Norwich City and Brighton and Hove Albion.</sup>
      </p>
      <p>He has been a big miss for Smith and his <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> side, who have lacked his creative flair in midfield.</p>
      <p>It's no coincidence that his side have lost two straight games without him.</p>
      <p>"Jack's been training with us, but I am a bit ill-at-ease to say he's been available because I've said it the last couple of weeks and he's not played, such has been his calf injury," <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Smith</a> said.</p>
      <p>"But he's trained with us for the last week so I have no doubts he will be there and in his happy place at Villa Park playing in front of the fans."</p>
