      <p>Nov. 22 (UPI) -- Tesla Motors showed off its electric "Cybertruck" late Thursday -- a radically styled pickup with "unbreakable" windows, which appeared at its unveiling to be a bit more fragile than advertised.</p>
      <p>Tesla CEO <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Elon_Musk/?tps=1">Elon Musk</a> revealed the Cybertruck at a promotional event in Los Angeles. The pickup is notable for its sharply futurist design and is expected to compete with market leaders Ford, General Motors and Dodge in the full-size pickup truck class.</p>
      <p>The vehicle is Tesla's first pickup and will sell starting at just under $40,000. Tesla said it can travel 250 miles on a single charge for the base model. A dual-motor, four-wheel-drive version -- for an extra $10,000 -- increases the range to 300 miles.</p>
      <p>The top-end version of the Cybertruck, with a tri-motor and four-wheel-drive, will sell for just under $70,000. A self-driving option is available for another $7,000.</p>
      <p>"Cybertruck is built with an exterior shell made for ultimate durability and passenger protection," Tesla states on the Cybertruck website. "Starting with a nearly impenetrable exoskeleton, every component is designed for superior strength and endurance, from Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless-steel structural skin to Tesla armor glass."</p>
      <p>Thursday's demo didn't go quite to plan when Tesla designer Franz Holzhausen took a metal ball to demonstrate the truck's shatter-proof windows, and heavily damaged the glass -- to the great surprise of a startled Musk.</p>
      <p>"Oh my [expletive] God! Well, maybe that was a little too hard," Tesla's chief executive answered.</p>
      <p>Tesla said production of the Cybertruck will begin in 2021.</p>
      <p>Matt DeLorenzo, senior executive editor at <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kelley_Blue_Book/?tps=1">Kelley Blue Book</a>, said the Cybertruck will likely have only a limited impact on the truck market.</p>
      <p>"It will be a niche product at best and poses no threat in the pickup market as we know it today," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/11/22/business/22reuters-tesla-pickup.html">he said</a>. "The other downside is that this truck will have no federal tax credits by the time it comes out."</p>
