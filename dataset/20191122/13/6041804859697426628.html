      <p>Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy evaded the Court Appearance on one more Friday. The CBI Court today heard the arguments in the Obulapuram Mining Case. Jagan did not attend the court and filed a petition to exempt from the Court appearance and the Court agreed.</p>
      <p>In his petition,<a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/politics/jagan-assures-all-necessary-help-to-lakshmi-parvathi/"> Jagan</a> went on to say that he can not attend the court since he is touring East Godavari due to World Fisheries Day and will be launching the YSR Matsyakara Nestham. It is known to our readers that the Chief Minister is evading the court for one reason or the other ever since he came to power.</p>
      <p>Jagan tried to get the complete exemption citing several grounds but the court refused it. It has to be seen how CBI which alleged Jagan trying to influence the witnesses, will react to these actions which amount to an intentional delay of court proceedings.</p>
