      <p>Nollywood screen diva, <a href="http://concisenews.global/entertainment/">Adesua Etomi</a> has expressed her worries that Nigerian leaders neglect issues affecting the country but rather focusing on regulating social media.</p>
      <p>Concise News reports that the Nigerian Senate has read for the second time a <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/21/social-media-bill-passes-second-reading-at-senate/">bill seeking to regulate social media.</a></p>
      <p>The bill entitled, ‘Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation 2019’, passed second reading after Sani Musa, senator representing Niger east and its sponsor, moved a motion for a debate on the proposed law.</p>
      <p>While leading the debate on the bill, Musa said the proposed law is not an attempt to stifle free speech, but an attempt to check the growing threats which if left unchecked can cause “serious damage” in society.</p>
      <p>“While the internet has democratised information, the fact remains that it has also been a weapon in the process which is why governments across the world trying to mitigate the risks associated with information transmission via internet by monitoring abuse and deliberate misconduct,” he said.</p>
      <p>In her reaction on Twitter, the stunning actress slammed the Nigerian government while highlighting the basic problems the country is faced with.</p>
      <p>Adesua wrote “Millions of children out of school, infant and maternal mortality rates at an all time high, insecurity, poverty, lack of job opportunities…</p>
      <p>“But our leaders are looking to pass a Social Media Bill. This bill will be a big problem. I’m worried for us.”</p>
