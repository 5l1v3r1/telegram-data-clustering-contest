      <h1>Analyst Predicts Two Consecutive Years of Box Office Drops, Cuts Exhibitor Stocks Price Targets</h1>
      <h2>B. Riley FBR's Eric Wold says that will "pressure" film theater stock valuations until mid-2020 before the group “begins to see some love” from investors.</h2>

      <p>With <i>Frozen 2</i> ringing in the all-important final stretch of the box-office year, Hollywood's eyes are on whether year-end tentpole releases can help make up the 6 percent domestic revenue decline the industry has recorded year-to-date compared with 2018.</p>
      <p>B. Riley FBR analyst Eric Wold in a Friday report lowered his fourth-quarter and 2020 forecasts for the exhibition sector. He now predicts a 4 percent box-office decline for 2019, followed by another drop in 2020. As a result, he reduced his price targets on all exhibition stocks and even downgraded shares of Cinemark to "neutral."<br/><br/>"Consecutive Annual Box Office Declines Could Pressure Valuations Into Mid-2020," he said in the title of his report. <br/><br/>"We are revisiting our exhibitor coverage as we approach the most important stretch of the fourth-quarter 2019 film slate, which will bring <i>Frozen II</i>, <i>Jumanji: The Next Level</i>, and <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> to screens. However, with quarter-to-date box office down 14.7 percent after weak results from <i>Doctor Sleep</i>, <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i>, and <i>Charlie's Angels</i>, we now believe fourth-quarter box office could be relatively flattish year-ver-year versus consensus expectations for a mid-single-digit increase ... This could lead to a full-year 2019 box office decline of around 4.0 percent."</p>
      <p>Since Disney completed the acquisition of Fox and moved <i>Avatar 2</i> from 2020 to 2021, he has also been projecting a low- to mid-single-digit box office decline for 2020. "However, with a high number of 'untitled' TBD placeholders on the calendar, we are taking a more conservative approach and bumping our assumed decline to mid-single-digits until we get more visibility into the quality of the film slate," Wold wrote. "This takes our 2020 exhibitor estimates well below current consensus expectations."</p>
      <p>The analyst predicts that film theater investors will be cautious over the near-term. "We increasingly believe that investors may choose to avoid the exhibitor group, at a maximum, or put a lid on valuation multiples, at a minimum, until well into mid-2020 given the diminished outlook for the film slate — and that it may not be until mid-2020 when investors begin to shift their focus to the 2021 slate before the exhibitor group begins to see some love," he said.</p>
      <p>Wold explained his Cinemark downgrade from "buy" to "neutral" this way: "While we have become increasingly optimistic around improving results for the Latin American circuit after years of attendance declines, we believe that short-term domestic box office movements are more likely to influence valuation decisions over the next 6-12 months." He cut his price target on the stock from $46.50 to $37.</p>
      <p>Wold maintained his "buy" rating on Imax's stock, but reduced his price target from $34 to $30, calling it "a standout within the group due to the about 70 percent of box office generated from international markets, the four-year backlog visibility and near double-digit screen growth projections."</p>
      <p>He also continues to rate AMC Entertainment shares at "buy" while cutting his price target from $19 to $15. "Even with an expected 2020 box office decline, we remain confident in the ability of AMC's Stubs A-List subscription program to (profitably) take and market share in the coming years," Wold wrote. "Coupled with self-help driven free cash flow improvements, we expect this to provide valuation support for the shares."</p>
      <p>Despite his lower box-office forecasts, Wold also emphasized that "we remain positive on the long-term outlook for the exhibition sector and believe that most investor/media concerns around increasing streaming competition have been misplaced and recognize that there are often strings of successes and failures in the box office."</p>
