      <p>A Tatar Muslim man serving a prison term for being a member of an Islamic group banned in Russia has gone on a hunger strike to protest prison conditions and what his mother called "pressure" imposed by the prison's administration.<br/><br/>Gulnara Karimova told RFE/RL on November 22 that her son, Airat Shakirov, who is in a penal colony in the northwestern region of Vologda, has been on a hunger strike since November 8.<br/><br/>According to Karimova, her son is refusing to eat any kind of solid food and is only accepting water.<br/><br/>Karimova also said that Shakirov is being sent periodically and unjustly to solitary confinement, the so-called Unified Premises Of Cell Type (EPKT), a facility used by prison guards in Russia to punish inmates who break the internal regulations of correctional institutions.<br/><br/>"They want to break him, to force him to join the so-called "reds" [inmates who agree to cooperate with prison guards and are despised by other inmates as they are considered informants]," she said.<br/><br/>"Because he refuses to collaborate with the prison administration, they retaliate and put him in solitary confinement on a regular basis," Karimova said, adding that prison officials had refused to give her documents explaining why her son was being kept in a solitary confinement when she visited him earlier in November.<br/><br/>The administration of the Correctional Colony No.12 in the Sheksna district, where Shakirov is serving his term, was not immediately available for comments.<br/><br/>The Violga Regional Court in the city of Samara sentenced Shakirov to 18 years in prison in 2017 after finding him guilty of being a member of the Hizb ut-Tahrir Islamic group, which was banned in Russia and whose supporters were branded by Moscow as "extremists" in 2003.<br/><br/>Hizb ut-Tahrir is a global organization based in London that seeks to unite all Muslim countries into an Islamic caliphate. Its members insist the group is peaceful.<br/><br/>Violations of inmates' rights in Russia, including torture, have been raised by right defenders for years.</p>
