        <b>Xherdan Shaqiri has been told he has a future at Liverpool, but Reds boss <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/managers/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> was far from happy answering questions about the attacker.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shaqiri has hardly featured this term, but he is now back in training following a calf problem that has blighted his opportunity to break into the side.</p>
      <p>The Swiss international had voiced dissatisfaction with his manager earlier in the season, but with the Reds still involved in five competitions, including the World Club Championship, the chance to shine is surely coming.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/klopp-shocked-by-pochettino-axe-says-mourinho-was-desperate"><b>Klopp, who has said Jose Mourinho was “desperate” to get back into the Premier League,</b> </a>confirmed the 28-year-old’s time will come, but he was irked by a question concerning transfer speculation resurfacing about Shaqiri.</p>
      <p>Klopp, who visibly irked, said: “Why should I talk about something that has no interest to us? That’s just the world outside.</p>
      <p>“He didn’t have exactly the amount of games he wanted to but that’s it pretty much. I am with him, he is completely happy here. Speculation is speculation.</p>
      <p>“Of course, he has a future here. We only talk about this season and this season he is a very important player for us.”</p>
      <p>But with Liverpool embarking on a hectic run of fixtures over the next two months – starting with the Premier League trip to Crystal Palace on Saturday – Klopp thinks Shaqiri will be given opportunities in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>“He has been really long injured, I think five weeks, so to get the match fitness again that takes time,” said Klopp</p>

      <p>“He trained this week and we gave him some different things to do but that’s it, apart from that he should be completely fine.</p>
      <p>“There is no reason to rush it but it’s nice to have him back. We saw a lot of really nice things in training this week but it is intense for him and he needs to get used to the intensity again and everything will be fine.</p>
      <p>“He just has to train, no other reason. To get the match fitness takes time. He trained this week. Apart from that, he should be completely fine.</p>
      <p>“Yes, he offers an option in attack, but he needs to be fit for that.</p>
      <p>“That is all we are concerned about at the moment. He was out long and he trained and was really good in moments and in other moments it was different to the rehab stuff he did before.</p>
      <p>“All good, the most intense period is coming so he will be ready for that hopefully if nothing happens again and you will see him on the pitch, 100%.”</p>
