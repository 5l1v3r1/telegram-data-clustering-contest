      <h1>B2B FinTechs Diversify Funding Strategies With M&amp;A, IPOs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:00:07+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>Talk of a decelerating FinTech venture capital market continued to mount this week with reports that digital banking startup <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/fintech-investments/2019/celebrity-backed-digital-bank-aspiration-battling-for-new-funds/">Aspiration</a> is struggling to raise money.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/dicaprio-backed-digital-bank-aspiration-has-run-into-funding-issue.html">CNBC reports</a>, the company has recently laid off staff as it works to close another round of funding despite high-profile backing from celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and Orlando Bloom, a challenge the publication said is “a potential sign that investors are cooling on risky startups after the <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/debt/2019/wework-reveals-90-day-plan-turn-company-around/">WeWork</a> debacle.”</p>
      <p>Indeed, WeWork’s recent troubles have shaken confidence in the tech startup funding environment. However recent analysis from <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/b2b-unicorns-need-50-less-funds-than-b2c/articleshow/72100141.cms">Iron Pillar</a>, as reported recently in the Times of India, suggests that such a slowdown may not be detrimental to the B2B FinTech startup arena.</p>
      <p>According to Iron Pillar’s report, B2B startups need 50 percent less capital than startups providing consumer-facing products and services if they wish to achieve a $1 billion valuation (unicorn status).</p>
      <p>Further, this week’s B2B Venture Capital roundup finds VC funding isn’t the only investment strategy for B2B FinTechs, with (mergers and acquisitions) M&amp;A activity seeking a spike, as well as some high-profile plans by industry players to go public.</p>

        <b>Venture Capital Funding</b>

      <p>In the largest funding round of the week, alternative small business lender <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/bluevine-adds-checking-accounts-cards-for-small-firms/">BlueVine</a> Capital <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/bluevine-secures-funding-build-small-business-banking-services/">announced</a> $102.5 million in funding led by ION Crossover Partners. Lightspeed Venture Partners, Menlo Ventures, 83North, SVB Capital, Nationwide, Citi Ventures, M12 and private investors also participated in the Series F round, which reflects B2B FinTech investors’ focus on later-stage startups.

      <p>In the small business insurtech space, professional services company Aon <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/partnerships-acquisitions/2019/aon-acquires-digital-smb-insurance-platform-coverwallet/">announced</a> the takeover of <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/coverwallet-digital-insurance-smb/">CoverWallet</a> in a deal that will connect Aon to the $200 billion digital insurance market.

      <p>The most high-profile M&amp;A deal in B2B FinTech this week was the completion of the takeover of Sage Pay, for which Elavon paid $300 million. The <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/partnerships-acquisitions/2019/elavon-spends-300m-for-sage-pay/">acquisition</a> follows Sage Group’s announcement that it was seeking “strategic alternatives for the payments business” as it shifts its focus on accounting and payroll software.
