      <h1>Amazon May Announce Its Cloud Gaming Service In 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:00:30+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/bryanlim/" target="_blank">Bryan Lim</a></address>
      <p>A recent report suggests that Amazon might be joining the cloud gaming industry in 2020. It was also revealed that Amazon was in talks with game publishers to be onboard its service.</p>
      <p>According to CNET, the e-commerce site has been recruiting people from other companies to help with the service’s development. One  of the companies was Microsoft, which makes sense, as Microsoft has its own <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/180076/microsoft-gives-public-first-look-of-project-xcloud-game-streaming-service/">xCloud</a> cloud gaming project as a start. Amazon is also planning to reveal the service next year.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the report mentioned that industry insiders believed Amazon is shifting its focus towards cloud gaming after struggles with its game development studio. Also, it is said that Amazon could tie in the service with its Amazon Prime subscription.</p>

      <p>Before it happens, though, Amazon might have a few things to learn from the the rocky launch of <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/199693/google-stadia-common-consensus-your-mileage-may-vary/">Google Stadia</a>. The latter had cases where people who pre-ordered the Stadia controller only received their registration code a few days after its launch. Furthermore, there is also noticeable input delays which can disrupt your gaming experience, especially for shooters.</p>
      <p>Currently, details of games and pricing of Amazon’s cloud gaming service are still not known. Even though Stadia had a headstart in the industry, we’ll see how Amazon will compete with Google when it is announced in the future.</p>
