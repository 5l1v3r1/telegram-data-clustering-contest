      <p>The story of how Mike Tod discovered Alberta’s Romaniuk Family may not be quite as fascinating as the story of how the Romaniuk Family discovered the Carter Family eight decades earlier.</p>
      <p>But there is a common thread.</p>
      <p>As devoted fans of old-timey music already know, the Carter Family’s pioneering traditional folk had turned them into bonafide celebrities by the late 1930s. In the twilight years of A.P. and Sara Carter’s marriage, the family was reaching a massive North American audience thanks to a million-watt Mexican radio station run by a charlatan named Dr. Brinkley. Among those listening was a coal-mining family in Edson, Alta., who would gather around the radio to hear the Carters. Ed Romaniuk, the family patriarch, became so taken by the sounds he was hearing that he turned his own family into a Canuck replica of sorts, concentrating mostly on Carter Family repertoire. Eventually, the two families would meet.</p>
      <p>Tod, on the other hand, discovered the Romaniuk Family in a far more traditional manner. A friend unearthed an obscure CD at Recordland in Inglewood that featured recordings from the family.</p>
      <p>But where these stories of discovery overlap is in musical obsession, something both Tod and Ed Romaniuk share.</p>
      <p>“I’ve known about that story, and thought about the story and listened to the recordings of the Romaniuk Family for about six years,” says Tod, a Calgary ethnomusicologist, musician and creator of the 13-episode podcast, The Folk.</p>
      <p>Not long after hearing the recordings, Tod began reading Will You Miss Me When I’m Gone, a biography of the Carter Family by Mark Zwonitzer. Tucked into the often soap-operaish details of the Carters’ story and legacy were two references to the Romaniuk Family.</p>
      <p>“They are only one paragraph each out of an entire book, but it’s those two paragraphs that I used as a springboard and dove into that story,” he says. “Who were those people? Where did they come from and how did they have a relationship with one of the greatest musical families of the 20th century?”</p>
      <p>The tales of these two families became the heart of <a href="https://www.thefolkpodcast.com/episodes/tf003-alberta-a-tale-of-two-families">A Tale of Two Families</a>, Tod’s Oct. 31 episode of The Folk. Since mid-October, he has been releasing a podcast every Thursday. Each one covers a different region of Canada, shining a light on the often unknown histories of those instrumental in forming Canada’s early musical landscape when it comes to folk and old-timey music.</p>
      <p>While this might sound like it falls into acquired-taste territory, Tod’s playful narration, encyclopedic knowledge, occasionally strange segues and obsessive attention to detail has helped turned The Folk into an unlikely hit, reaching Apple’s Canadian Top 30 of music-focused podcasts.</p>
      <p>It’s a nice bit of vindication for the musician and scholar, who spent eight months tirelessly researching, developing and writing the podcasts. Season 1 takes listeners from the fiddle players of Cape Breton, to early bluegrass players of New Brunswick, to the even earlier folk music of Prince Edward Island, circa the 1800s. Along the way we meet a number of intriguing characters, including “The First Lady of the Accordion” Minnie White, Nunavut “jokester” and country-folk legend Charlie Panigoniak of Nunavut and twenty-something Yukon fiddler Sarah Hamilton, who is giving new life to old-timey music in the north.</p>
      <p>Information about these characters, and the musical histories of the regions they come from, is out there, Tod insists. It’s just a matter of taking the time to find it.</p>
      <p>“The thing is, it’s in pieces,” he says.  “Part of my job is to be almost like a puzzler, I put these pieces that exist in small segments here and there — whether it’s a journal article, newspaper clipping, family members sharing stories, friends sharing stories — and I put all these pieces together to make an episode. I’ve calculated (that) about 100 hours goes into one hour of audio, one episode. Essentially, I think what I’ve done is attempted to write a book and then record that book within the span of an eight-month window.”</p>
      <p>Obsessive? Absolutely.</p>
      <p>“It was just something I was driven to do, I thought it had to be done,” he says. “It was just a lot of stuff that had been twirling around and peculating in my mind for some time. Some of the stories, some of the episodes, I’ve been thinking about for a long, long time.”</p>
      <p>Part of the charm is Tod’s singular style. While his master’s degree in ethnomusicology from York University certainly provides a certain scholarly rigour to The Folk, these are not dry academic accounts. In the Romaniuk episode, Tod tells the story of how the families crossed paths but also takes some off-road excursions into the Big Bang theory, creeping determinism and even the Kardashians. He is also a folk musician himself who says his interest in the genre’s history is as passionate as it is academic.</p>
      <p>“To me, folk music is a living, breathing organism that is a part of my life,” he says. “Each episode is sort of this brain dump of everything that takes place in my mind when I listen to the music. There’s a definite narrative: a beginning, middle, and end and generally there’s a problem or issue being introduced. So there is a structure in that way. But I go all over the place because my mind wanders and drifts into these wild locations when I’m listening to this music.”</p>
      <p>The eight-month process of researching and writing the podcasts was supported by a grant by the Alberta Foundation for the Arts, but much of the funding beyond that has come from Tod’s own pocket. He has set up a Patreon fund in the hope fans will financially support a second season.</p>
      <p>The success of the podcast’s first season suggests there is an audience open to in-depth and entertaining studies of our country’s often overlooked musical legacies.</p>
      <p>“There seems to be a new wave of interest in old music, in old-time and traditional folk music,” Tod says. “I point to the Ken Burns documentary that just came out on PBS, Country Music. It’s gotten people talking about this style of music and also the stories of the people who played it. Whereas Ken Burns is totally focused on American music and that’s fantastic, my series is an attempt to do something similar but up in the north.”</p>
      <p>Mike Tod will perform music and discuss The Folk on Sunday, Nov. 24 at the Central Public Library at 7 p.m. Visit  <a href="https://www.thefolkpodcast.com/">thefolkpodcast.com </a></p>
