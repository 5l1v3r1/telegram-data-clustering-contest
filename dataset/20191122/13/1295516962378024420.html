      <h1>Vic Mignogna Claims Defamation Lawsuits Were a Last Resort, Not Vengeance</h1>

      <p>Last month, a Dallas court dismissed all of the claims that <i>Dragon Ball Super: Broly</i> voice actor Vic Mignogna filed against Funimation, the anime dubbing and distribution company, along with two other voice actors (Monica Rial and Jamie Marchi) and the fiancee of Rial, Ronald Toye, who all made public statements regarding sexual harassment allegations against Mignogna.</p>
      <p>While Mignogna is appealing the dismissals of his claims (which accused Funimation, Rial, Marchi and Toye of defamation, tortious interference of existing contracts and tortious interference of business relations), he was also back in court determining whether he would have to pay the legal fees of Funimation and the others, along with possible sanctions.</p>

      <p>Mignogna is defending himself against counter-claims of Funimation and the others that were filed as part of the Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA), which is a Texas state law designed to combat so-called "SLAPP" lawsuits. SLAPP stands for Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation. It refers to lawsuits designed specifically to silence critics of an individual or an organization by forcing the critics to go to court to defend their actions. SLAPP suits are not typically meant to be won, per se, but rather to keep critics busy with lawyers and court fees and also to intimidate any other critics from stepping forward, for fear that they will be sued as well. A number of states, such as Texas, have come up with specific laws to combat these types of lawsuits.</p>
      <p>Mignogna has to prove that his lawsuits were not SLAPP suits. The legal fees in these cases are roughly $800,000, so a lot is at stake for Mignogna to demonstrate that he was not using the courts simply to silence and/or punish his critics.</p>

      <p>Witnesses in the courtroom were impressed by how well Mignogna did in explaining his motives for filing the lawsuits. The actor explained, “I was really scared, but I felt like I had to do something. I had seen this all spiraling so badly over a couple of months that I decided I had no other recourse to save whatever career or reputation I had left.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://screenrant.com/funimation-vic-mignogna-defamation-lawsuit/">Mignogna</a> claims that he had actually planned to turn to Rial for advice on what to do before she, too, posted online about the allegations against Mignogna. When the defense's lawyer asked Mignogna if the intent of his suit was to silence his critics, the actor replied, “No sir, they had been speaking out for months. There was no shutting anyone up.”</p>
      <p>One of the defense's key points in court was to tie Mignogna to Nick Rekieta, the Minnesota lawyer who created a GoFundMe page for Mignogna's legal funds and who has been very aggressive on YouTube towards the defendants, including stating, “I think they’re terrible people and I want to see them ground into dust.” Mignogna distanced himself from Rekieta, “I just assume he does whatever he wants to do. I’m not responsible for what Rekieta says.”</p>
      <p>District Judge John Chupp might rule on whether Mignogna's suits were SLAPP suits as early as today.</p>
