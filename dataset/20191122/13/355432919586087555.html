      <h1>Trump says people went easy on Yovanovitch because she's a woman</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:50:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/brett-samuels" target="_blank">Brett Samuels</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> on Friday ripped former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine <a href="https://thehill.com/people/marie-yovanovitch">Marie Yovanovitch</a>, a key witness in the impeachment inquiry, suggesting that people were going easy on her because she's a woman and asserting that she "was not an angel."</p>
      <p>"I said, ‘Why are you being so kind?’ ‘Well, sir, she’s a woman. We have to be nice,' " Trump said. "She’s very tough. I heard bad things."</p>
      <p>Trump, in a phone interview on “Fox &amp; Friends,” went on to say Yovanovitch would not put up his portrait in the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine and dismissively described her as "an Obama person."</p>
      <p>He questioned why his allies hadn't been tougher on her before, suggesting it was related to her gender.</p>
      <p>"This was not an angel, this woman, OK?" Trump said during the interview.</p>
      <p>"And there was a lot of things that she did that I didn’t like, and we'll talk about that at some point, but I just want to let you know this was not a baby that we’re dealing with," he added.</p>
      <p>Trump has said previously that he does not know Yovanovitch very well.</p>
      <p>Yovanovitch <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/470750-yovanovitch-impeachment-testimony-gives-burst-of-momentum-to-democrats">testified before the House Intelligence Committee</a> last week in the impeachment inquiry into Trump that is largely centered around his conduct in Ukraine. She described what she called a smear campaign by the president's allies, including his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, to paint her as anti-Trump and get her out of the job.</p>
      <p>Multiple other witnesses expressed frustration with the treatment of Yovanovitch, describing her as a State Department employee with a long track record of good work.</p>
      <p>The president and his allies have noted that Trump has a right to recall ambassadors.</p>
      <p>“I obviously don't dispute that the president has the right to withdraw an ambassador at any time for any reason, but I do wonder why it was necessary to smear my reputation also,” Yovanovitch said during her testimony.</p>
