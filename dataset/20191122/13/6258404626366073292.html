      <p>The ink is barely dry on the release announcement for the <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-amd-ryzen-power-surface-pro-7-intel-ice-lake">Surface Laptop 3</a>, but Microsoft is already piling on the discounts for the ultra-portable. In this case, Microsoft is providing a big discount on the 256GB SKU of the 13.5-inch Surface Laptop 3.</p>
      <p>The Surface Laptop 3 typically starts at $999 for 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The next step up includes a 256GB SSD and is priced at $1,299. However, with this latest discount, Microsoft is knocking $300 off the price, making the 256GB version the same price as the entry-level model. The discount applies to all five available colors: Sandstone, Black, Cobalt Blue (w/Alcantara palm rest), Platinum, and Platinum (w/Alcantara palm rest).</p>
      <p><a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s 13.5-inch <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/surface-laptop-3">Surface Laptop 3</a> in this configuration comes with an Intel Core i5-1035G7 processor, which is based on 10nm <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/ice-lake">Ice Lake</a> architecture. It also uses Gen11 Iris Plus integrated graphics.</p>

      <p>The Surface Laptop 3 has a 13.5-inch 2256x1504 PixelSense Display, support for the <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/surface-pen">Surface Pen</a>, and weighs just 2.84 pounds. Microsoft rates the deviceâ€™s runtime at up to 11.5 hours with "typical use". If the 256GB configuration isn't enough, there are also 512GB and 1TB SKUs available along with up to 16GB of LPDDR4x RAM (at an added cost, of course).</p>
      <p>You can purchase the 13.5-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/configure/Surface-Laptop-3/8VFGGH1R94TM?crosssellid=drawer2&amp;selectedColor=CBB1A0&amp;preview=&amp;previewModes=">clicking the following link</a>.</p>
      <p>For those needing a bigger screen and little more muscle under the hood, you can always upgrade to the <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/microsoft-surface-pro-7-surface-pro-x-surface-laptop-3-hands-on">15-inch version of the Surface Laptop 3</a> which rocks custom AMD Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7 3000 processors and Radeon Vega graphics. That laptop, however, is priced from $1,199.</p>
