      <p>Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress have finalised the name of Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray as the next chief minister of Maharashtra. The alliance, which hopes to stake a claim at the power in Maharashtra soon, met for a crucial final meeting on Friday to hammer out last details of their power-sharing formula and common minimum programme.</p>
      <p>NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who was first to leave the meeting being held at Nehru Centre in Mumbai, told the press that the alliance has finalised the name of Uddhav as the CM.</p>
      <p>"Detailed discussion has taken place. The drafting process is going on. As far as CM post is concerned, there is no difference of opinion about that. Everybody has agreed that the government should be formed under the leadership of Uddhav Thackeray. Discussion on the rest of the programmes is going on. We will take a detailed press conference tomorrow and inform everyone," Sharad Pawar said.</p>
      <p>Moments later, Uddhav Thackeray also came out and said that discussions were still underway and were going in the right direction.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut later confirmed that Uddhav Thackeray has agreed to accept the post of the CM.</p>
      <p>After the meeting ended, NCP and Congress held a press conference where they informed the media that while most of the issues have resolved, talks will continue on Saturday. "All issues were discussed and almost decided, everything will be clear tomorrow," Prithviraj Chavan said.</p>
      <p>The joint press conference of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, which was scheduled for Friday, is now expected to be held on Saturday after another round of talks.</p>
      <p>Top sources have told India Today TV that all three parties have agreed to the power-sharing formula, i.e. Shiv Sena to get CM + 15 ministerial births, NCP 14 and Congress 12.</p>
      <p>Sources said that the Speaker's post is a likely point of contention between NCP and Congress. Both want the post. Sources also said that Congress wants Prithviraj Chavan as the Speaker, while NCP is against it. Additionally, the NCP also wants to make sure that there are two deputy CMs to ensure equal accountability between NCP and Congress.</p>
      <p>These issues are likely to be taken up during the meeting on Saturday. If all is sorted, the leaders of the three parties are expected to meet, issue a joint statement and approach the governor on the same day.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra has been stuck in a political logjam since October 24, when the results of the assembly elections were declared. Even as the pre-poll alliance between Shiv Sena and BJP won with a clear mandate, the state awaits formation of the government.</p>
      <p>The limbo started after Sena accused the BJP of breaking the pre-poll promise of rotational CM. When the negotiations between allies failed, Sena turned to ideological opposite Congress and NCP. Negotiations have been underway for past 10 days as the state remains under the President's Rule in the absence of an elected government. Will the limbo end on Saturday, we will have to wait and watch.</p>
