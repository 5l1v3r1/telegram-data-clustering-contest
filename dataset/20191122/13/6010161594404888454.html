      <p>Starting from today, you’ll be able to take part in the <b>Fishing Frenzy </b>angling contest in Fortnite. The event runs until 8 pm ET/ 5 pm PT on November 24, which is 1 am GMT on November 25 and all you’ll need to take part is a<b> Fishing Rod.</b></p>

      <h3>How to take part in the Fishing Frenzy competition</h3>
