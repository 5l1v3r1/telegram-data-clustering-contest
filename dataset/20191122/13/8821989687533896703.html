      <h1>The Who Discuss 1979 Cincinnati Concert Tragedy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:51:29+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Kielty</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/pete-townshend/">Pete Townshend </a>and <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/roger-daltrey/">Roger Daltrey</a> are remembering the tragedy in which 11 <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/the-who/">Who</a> fans died 40 years ago in Cincinnati.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/who-cincinnati-11-die-1979/">crowd stampede</a> ahead of a concert on Dec. 3, 1979 at the Riverfront Coliseum resulted in the deaths of people aged between 15 and 27, along with eight other serious injuries. In order to avoid the risk of a riot, the show was allowed to go ahead, but the Who were not told what happened until after the main set was over.</p>
      <p>“You know, I’m still traumatized by it,” Townshend told WCPO in a new documentary called <i>The Who: The Night That Changed Rock</i>. “It’s a weird thing to have in your autobiography that, you know, 11 kids died at one of your concerts. It’s a strange, disturbing, heavy load to carry.”</p>
      <p>Daltrey added: “That dreadful night of the third of December became one of the worst dreams I’ve had in my life.” Band manager Bill Curbishley, who made the decision to proceed with the show, said: “Despite everything, I still feel inadequate. I don’t know about the guys, but for me, I left a little bit of my soul in Cincinnati.”</p>
      <p>The documentary was created by broadcaster Tanya O’Rourke, who grew up in an area where three of the victims came from. She explored the effect the tragedy had on the survivors, and how concert arrangements across the country were changed to keep a similar event from happening again.</p>
      <p>“I'm proud of our team's work in commemorating those who were lost that night,” WCPO executive Mike Canan said. “I’m equally proud of Tanya and our team's empathy for the victims and those who have dealt with loss and guilt from this incident for 40 years."</p>
      <p><i>The Who: The Night That Changed Rock</i> airs at 8 p.m. ET on Dec. 3, and will stream live on the <a href="https://www.wcpo.com/">WCPO website</a>.<br/> <br/> </p>
      <h3>Music's Worst Concert Accidents and Tragedies</h3>

      <h4>The Rolling Stones at Altamont</h4>
      <p>When the Rolling Stones headlined a free festival at Altamont on Dec. 6, 1969, it was supposed to be a celebratory wrap-up for their successful U.S. tour. In retrospect, hiring members of the Hells Angels as security was a deadly mistake. Fighting in the crowd led to injuries and one audience member was killed after a scuffle with a member of the motorcycle club.</p>

      <h4>The Who in Cincinnati</h4>
      <p>On Dec. 3, 1979, 11 people were killed when an impatient crowd of 8,000 fans, who had been waiting outside for hours for a show by The Who, turned into a panicked stampede upon being allowed into the venue. The band were not told of the deaths until after the show, and they were collectively heartbroken. Roger Daltrey wanted to cancel the rest of the tour, but Pete Townshend urged the group to push forward, saying that “if we don't play tomorrow, we'll never play again.”</p>

      <h4>Metallica and Guns 'N' Roses in Montreal</h4>
      <p>After Metallica was forced to cut their half of a co-headlining concert with Guns 'N' Roses short when frontman James Hetfield was severely burned in an incident with pyrotechnics, Axl Rose further disappointed the audience by showing up late and then leaving an hour into the set due to reported vocal issues. The crowd of over 50,000 people began rioting, smashing stadium windows and setting fires. The incidents on Aug. 8, 1992 caused area police to chase the rioters through the streets, eventually using tear gas to regain control.</p>

      <h4>Woodstock '99</h4>
      <p>Hot temperatures, long lines for expensive water and general poor planning allowed destruction and violence to run rampant as Woodstock '99 was held on July 23-25, 1999. In the end, the event retained very little of the free-spirited peace and love vibes of the original Woodstock festival. Limp Bizkit's set saw fans tearing apart the walls erected to prevent gate-crashers and several rapes were reported. The next night, a bonfire was lit during the Red Hot Chili Peppers' closing slot.</p>

      <h4>Pearl Jam at the Roskilde Festival</h4>
      <p>Tragic events during Pearl Jam's set at the Roskilde Festival on June 30, 2000, in Denmark left nine people dead, many of them killed as fans rushed the stage. The always safety-conscious Pearl Jam stopped the show as soon as they learned of the events, but it was already too late. The band have stayed in touch with the families of the victims, referencing the lost in the lyrics of 'Love Boat Captain': “Nine friends we'll never know...two years ago today.”</p>

      <h4>The Great White Fire</h4>
      <p>One of the most preventable tragedies in recent rock history happened on Feb. 20, 2003, when pyrotechnics ignited soundproof insulation, causing a fire that killed 100 people at a Great White concert in West Warwick, R.I., including the band's guitarist, Ty Longley. More than 200 additional concert goers suffered smoke inhalation, burns and other injuries. Great White tour manager Daniel Biechele was sentenced to 10 years for involuntary manslaughter, and eventually paroled in 2008. The club ownership faced additional criminal charges, and the band, particularly lead singer Jack Russell, were deeply affected by the horrific events of that night.</p>

      <h4>Dimebag Darrell Killed Onstage</h4>
      <p>A fan with a history of mental illness named Nathan Gale climbed on stage and shot former Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell multiple times in the head during a concert on Dec. 8, 2004 in Columbus, Ohio by his new band, Damageplan. Three others were killed before Gale was brought down by a police officer's gunshot.</p>

      <h4>Love Parade</h4>
      <p>More than 500 people were injured and 21 people died on July 24, 2010 at an annual electronic music festival in Duisberg, Germany, which drew more than 1 million people to an area that had capacity for roughly 250,000. Passage to the area was mainly through tunnels which quickly became overcrowded with people trying to get to the show. Even though the tunnels were eventually closed, it did little to quell the deadly issues with capacity. As a result of the these tragedies, all future Love Parade events have been canceled.</p>

      <h4>The 2011 Indiana State Fair</h4>
      <p>Seven people died as a result of a weather-induced collapse of the stage prior to Sugarland's scheduled performance on Aug. 13, 2011 at the Indiana State Fair. Sugarland themselves were “stunned and heartbroken” by the events, calling them “tragic” and saying that there were “no words” to describe what had happened. State fairs and other similar events of a temporary nature are currently under intense pressure to put new safety measures in place in the future.</p>

      <h4>Pukkelpop Music Festival in Belgium</h4>
      <p>Severe storms in Belgium caused multiple stages to collapse on Aug. 18, 2011 at the Pukkelpop Festival, where a diverse lineup of acts were scheduled to perform, including the Offspring and the Foo Fighters. After the weather-related events left four people dead, the remainder of the festival was canceled. Local officials said that the intensity of the weather had not been predicted by local meteorologists, calling the storm “unprecedented” in comparison to previous tropical weather events.</p>

      <h4>Paris Concert Terrorist Attack</h4>
      <p>On Nov. 13, 2015, terrorists attacked a busy Paris nightlife scene, which left more than 100 people dead and many more injured. A concert by Eagles of Death Metal was hit the hardest, where more than 80 people were killed by the terrorists. Authorities had the situation under control within hours, but the tragedy marked one of the deadliest attacks on the Western world since 9/11.</p>

      <p>A terrorist attack at a May 22, 2017 concert by pop star Ariana Grande in Manchester, U.K., took the lives of more than 20 people – a number of whom were children. An additional 59 people were injured, some gravely. The suicide nail-bombing, which happened as concertgoers left following the show, was the deadliest terror attack on British soil since the 2005 London bombings.</p>
