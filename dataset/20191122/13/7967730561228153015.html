      <h1>Frozen in the glare of endless options</h1>

      <p>Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was once reported to have decreed that all shoes must be brown. Given the preponderance of young men in cheap blue suits, his wish appears to have come true, at least around racetracks and beer barns.</p>
      <p>This loathsome murderer, who in 1978 reportedly* provoked the Queen to hide behind a bush in the Buckingham Palace Gardens to avoid him, may, for once, have been on to something. Eliminate choice. It is the first rule in the dictator's playbook.</p>
      <p>Perhaps I would make a good downtrodden member of a dictatorship. I would pay cash money for someone to take away some of my choices. I am simply overburdened and overwhelmed by them.</p>

      <p>This is a long-standing problem. At university, there were two very lovely young women called Charlotte and Lucy who were besties. I made myself physically ill with worry trying to decide which to ask out on a date. Imagine, how relieved I was, when it became apparent that neither would in a million years go out with a sad little loser like me! The choice was made for me. One happy loser!</p>
      <p>I have the same problem in fast food restaurants. I avoid them not because I am concerned about my diet, but rather that I cannot get my head around the zillion zinger combo packs. And when you have finally made the choice, the helpful staff hit you up with further choices about upsizing, cookies, drinks, and for all I know, timeshare opportunities on the Gold Coast.</p>
      <p>John Howard in his prime faced no such dilemmas when on holiday. Hawks Nest annually for almost two decades.</p>
      <p>A trip to the bottle shop used to be simple – about four varieties of beer, red or white plonk, and Gordon’s Gin. Gin! How did Gin suddenly turn into Heinz with 57 varieties? Have you ever stood behind someone in a busy bar while they ponder Manly Gin vs Four Pillars, and Fevertree Indian versus Mediterranean tonic. And don’t think it is over then, oh no. Then you have the choice of lemon, orange, grapefruit, basil, thyme, or leaves of the Peruvian Chinchona tree.</p>
      <p>Choice slows us down. It requires thought and effort. We stick with banks charging us more than we need to be paying for our loans, because changing seems too hard, and who do we change too? Same with mobile phones, power companies and careers.</p>

      <p>There is a lot to be said for improvisation, in the sense of making do with what we have. It can help us get over the fear of missing out. To choose is to consciously elect to miss out on alternatives.</p>
      <p>However, choosing not to choose, also means we miss out. We need to manage this fear of missing out, by choosing to care about choice for things that really matter, and not worrying about the rest that are mere distractions.</p>
      <p>If hiding in a regal bush is important in your career, then make that choice and stop worrying.</p>
