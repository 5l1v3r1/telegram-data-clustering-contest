      <p>Lu Weibing: Xiaomi Working Hard to Overcome Screen Camera Technology<br/>3.9 (78.75%) 16 votes</p>
      <p>Probably, you know that Xiaomi Group Vice President, Redmi brand general manager Lu Weibing is very active on Weibo. <a href="https://m.ithome.com/html/458651.htm">Today</a>, one of his followers asked: ‘Which technology do you most expect to adopt on future smartphones?’ And he revealed that Xiaomi is working hard to overcome the screen camera technology. This is a clear hint that this innovative technology will appear on the coming Xiaomi phone soon.</p>
      <p>In fact, in June this year, Xiaomi announced its own front-view camera technology, which Xiaomi called ‘hidden screen technology’.</p>
      <p>According to the official introduction, when using the front camera, the screen on the camera will become transparent, allowing the light to fully enter and providing imaging. At the same time, it also said that this is a new technology of Xiaomi’s independent intellectual property rights. The front camera is placed under a specially customized screen. The latter has the characteristics of low reflection and high light transmission. It does not have any difference from the normal screen when not taking pictures. Other information is displayed normally.</p>
      <p>However, Xiaomi is not the first or the only one that works hard on the screen camera technology. Previously, we have heard <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/17/samsung-to-launch-a-smartphone-with-an-in-screen-camera-in-2020/">Samsung</a> will release an in-screen camera handset as soon as in 2020. Apart from this, another Chinese brand, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/06/26/oppo-unveils-under-screen-camera-technology/">OPPO</a> has already uncovered its own under-screen camera technology. But the company said the first generation of this technology won’t bring a mind-blowing quality.</p>
      <p>As you see, all top smartphone makers are working on this technology. But the question ‘<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/06/03/which-brand-will-launch-the-first-phone-with-under-screen-camera/">which brand will launch the screen camera handset firs?</a>’ still remains actual.</p>
