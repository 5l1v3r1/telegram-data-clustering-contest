      <p>Iceland has restocked its shelves with Greggs Festive Bakes and the Christmas pastries are being sold in store for way less than at Greggs.</p>
      <p>The frozen Festive Bakes usually cost £2 for two – meaning they're normally just £1 each.</p>
      <p>If you head into a Greggs store you can expect to pay £1.55 per slice.</p>

      <p>Admittedly you do have to bake the frozen treats at home, but for fans of the pastry it's no doubt good news ahead of the pricey festive season.</p>
      <aside>Buying the frozen Greggs Festive Bakes from Iceland a few weeks back was an excellent decision on my part.</aside>
      <p>The offer ends on December 3, so be quick, savvy shoppers!</p>
      <p>Some have even said they stocked up weeks ago.</p>

      <p>Others admitted: "That's not just a bake. It's the best thing on the Greggs menu."</p>
      <p>The bake is made up of chicken breast, sage and onion stuffing and bacon in a creamy sage and cranberry sauce, wrapped in puff pastry.</p>

      <p>The frozen pastries are almost identical to the fresh ones you can find at Greggs, but as well as a lower price point, in more good news they contain slightly fewer calories.</p>
      <p>The Iceland version has 450 calories, while at Greggs they contain 453.</p>

      <p>Greggs recently hit the headlines with the introduction of its "diet doughnuts" which made <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/piers-morgan/piers-morgan-rages-at-greggs-over-diet-doughnuts/">Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan fly into a rage</a>.</p>
