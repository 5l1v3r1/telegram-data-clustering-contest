      <h1>Zinedine Zidane hopes Real Madrid fans will support Gareth Bale following flag controversy</h1>
      <h2>The Spanish media reacted with fury after Bale held up a flag with the message 'Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order' folllowing his country's win over Hungary</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:10:13+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:10</time> by <a rel="author">Neil McLeman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/neil-mcleman/</a></address>
      <p>Zinedine Zidane has appealed to Real Madrid fans to back Gareth Bale after the Welshman caused a storm in Spain this week with the flag: "Wales, Golf, Madrid – In That Order.”</p>
      <p>Marca yesterday splashed with headline: “Disrespectful. Misguided. Ungrateful” while Diario AS <br/>said the £85m Galactico "was in a hole".</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Madrid</a> host Real Sociedad on Saturday but Zidane's pre-match press conference was dominated by Bale – and he was asked nine different questions on the Welshman.</p>
      <p>But the World Cup winner refused to condemn Bale – and said Real should support him if he returns at the Bernabeu Stadium tomorrow.</p>

      <p>Zidane said: “If you look at what he has done for this club and those who really support the club, and those who come to the stadium, they know he is a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> player. You shouldn’t look at what goes on elsewhere.</p>
      <p>"They have to support the team, the players, they have to get behind the side. And I will always support my players. Things might go on outside of the Real Madrid environment. But here, we are in this together.”</p>
      <p>Asked if Bale had shown “respect” to the 13-times Champions League winners, the Frenchman added: “I am not going to share my views. It’s not really anything to do with me. Gareth Bale is my player. I am the Real Madrid manager. They have always got their point of view and they are entitled to that point of view.</p>

      <p>“I think sometimes people go over the top with this topic. Everyone has got their point of view. We are here to focus on football. I think now it’s almost the snowball effect. I mean he fit and could play with the national team. He is here, back, and is available and we are delighted.</p>
      <p>"He has done a lot for this club. I am only concerned with the sporting side. I am not here to value the rest of it. To be honest, I am not that interested. I know a lot of people are interested, but not me.”</p>
      <p>Bale, who has been suffering with a calf injury, trained with Real Madrid for the first time in 47 days yesterday and could make his first appearance since October 5.</p>

      <p>Zidane reported he was fit and ready to go. But when asked if the Welshman was a guaranteed starter, the Real coach said: “I am not going to answer that. We know what Gareth can bring to the side, we have a lot of games coming up soon.</p>
      <p>"There are many of us here, we have lots of games coming up. All the players have an important part to play. We know what Gareth can bring to the side.”</p>
