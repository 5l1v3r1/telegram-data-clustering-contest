      <p>U.S. President Donald Trump predicted on Friday that a government watchdog report on the origins of the Russia probe that engulfed two years of his presidency will be historic - he also said he "wants a trial" in the Senate. </p>
      <p>Trump, in a bombastic interview with Fox News Channel's "Fox &amp; Friends", was commenting on an upcoming Justice Department watchdog report on the FBI's adherence to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requirements during the 2016 campaign.</p>
      <p>"The word is it's historic," said Trump, who declined to say how he knew. "That's what I hear. If it's historic, you're going to see something."</p>
      <p>While discussing a potential impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate, Trump said he would like Congressman Adam Schiff to testify after calling him a "sick puppy" who made the whole thing up. </p>

      <p>Trump continued promoting a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, a day after a former White House security adviser called it a “fictional narrative.”</p>
      <p>Trump said he was trying to root out corruption in the Eastern European nation when he withheld aid over the summer. Trump’s July 25 call with Ukraine’s president is at the center of the House impeachment probe, which is looking into Trump’s pressure on Ukraine to investigate political rivals as he held back nearly $400 million.</p>
      <p>Trump said, “There was no quid pro quo,” contradicting testimony by impeachment witnesses.</p>
