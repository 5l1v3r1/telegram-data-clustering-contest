      <p>I’m A Celebrity alum Stanley Johnson has made a huge dig at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebritys-jacqueline-jossa-breaks-tears-wakes-jungle-homesick-11197585/"> and Kate Garraway for getting emotional</a> in the jungle.</p>
      <p>During Thursday night’s instalment, the pair were seen tearing up as they discussed how much they were missing their children, four days after the show started.</p>
      <p>And Boris Johnson’s dad is having absolutely none of it.</p>
      <p>During an appearance on Loose Women, he told the panel: ‘I do wonder about the question of people getting teary when they’re missing their children. Women seem to do it…</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘You signed up to go off to the jungle for four or five weeks…’</p>
      <p>When Jane Moore reminded him that he became visibly emotional when receiving a poem from his wife, he added: ‘I teared up for half a second.’</p>
      <p>Stanley’s words come after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/im-a-celebrity-recap-caitlyn-jenner-learns-girls-aloud-dance-as-she-apologises-for-insulting-soap-stars-11196763/">Jacqueline broke down in tears on Thursday</a>, admitting she was homesick and missing daughters Ella and Mia, as well as husband Dan Osborne.</p>

      <p>Heading to the bush telegraph, she said: ‘I just woke up feeling a bit like “mmmm” when you’re just looking up at pure Jungle and you think, “wow, I’m so far away from home.”</p>
      <p>‘The thing is, everyone is missing their families, I just feel like it’s too soon to be crying missing your family…and we all smell so bad, we just stink, I stink.</p>
      <p>‘The smelliest I’ve ever been in my life.’</p>
      <p>It was up to Ian Wright to comfort the EastEnders actress, reassuring her that everything was okay.</p>
      <p>‘She misses her kids which is natural, she misses her husband, everything like that,’ he told the camera afterwards.</p>

      <p>Kate Garraway later explained she was also missing her family, getting emotional as she could no longer ‘remember what their heads smelled like’.</p>
      <p>They were then joined by Caitlyn Jenner, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-a-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-opens-up-about-being-a-father-and-reveals-her-kids-still-call-her-dad-ill-be-your-dad-till-the-day-i-die-11197359/">who opened up about life with her famous family</a>.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘My kids all call me dad, Kendall asked me first and I said, “dad”,’ she explained.</p>
      <p>‘I’m your dad and I’ll always be your dad till the day I die.</p>
      <p>‘But what they’re really good at which shocks me all the time is when they’re talking about me, [they say] “my dad, she”, and it’s tough to change the pronoun in the middle of it.</p>
      <p>‘Bruce raised them and Caitlyn is enjoying their life with them.’</p>
