      <p>Rangers boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> insists he'd be happy for fixtures to be moved or postponed if it means Scotland get to Euro 2020.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke's</a> national side have been drawn to face Israel in the playoff semi-final for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> before a game against Norway or Serbia in the final.</p>
      <p>The SFA have already written to the SPFL in a bid to stop games being moved for TV the weekend before.</p>
      <p>The Israel clash takes place on March 26, five days after Gers are scheduled to face St Mirren at home, although that fixture could yet be moved for TV purposes.</p>
      <p>And Gerrard said: "I represent this club in this country so for me I give it the support I need to give it. I certainly won't be standing in the way.</p>
      <p>"But we don't make those decisions. Ultimately it will be down to the SFA and stuff.</p>

      <p>"We'll go with the flow and if it means us skipping a game or adjusting a game we'll do everything we can to support (Scotland). That's what you've got to do."</p>
      <p>And Gerrard reckons Gers midfielder <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ryan-jack">Ryan Jack</a> could yet be a key figure for Scotland next year after impressing on his return to the international fold last week against Cyprus and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>He said: "I watched both games and I thought against Cyprus he was finding his way back into the international set up and getting used to the players around him.</p>
      <p>"It was his first start under Steve Clarke and I think Ryan's performance looked like he was adapting to everyone around him.</p>
      <p>"But in the second game he was outstanding. He showed the form that he's been in for us for an awful long time.</p>
      <p>"I'm sure he's given Steve Clarke something to think about because I think that midfield three - just to prove I'm not biased - of (Celtic's Callum) McGregor, Jack and John McGinn were outstanding as a threesome."</p>
