      <p>Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has played down a social-media video of Paul Pogba playing basketball only days after the midfielder had a cast removed from his ankle.</p>
      <p>Pogba is weeks away from a first-team return, having not played for United since the 1-1 draw with Arsenal on Sept 30, and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/10/27/paul-pogba-expected-sidelined-december-man-utd-saysole-gunnar/">faces a battle to be fit for the packed Christmas programme</a>. United have nine matches in December.</p>
      <p>The France international sparked alarm among some fans after posted on Instagram videos of himself playing basketball with NBA player Jimmy Butler, of Miami Heat.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer seemed unconcerned by the footage but admitted the player is not ready to begin training again.</p>
      <p>“We don’t play basketball,” Solskjaer said. “I don’t see many basketball players, tackling, twisting and turning their ankles and training with studs on.</p>
      <p>“He’s not ready to train. He had another scan at the start of the international break and his ankle has not healed up yet.</p>
      <p>“He is stepping up the recovery so he doesn’t have to have the cast on. When you are out for six or seven weeks, you do lose loads of muscle.</p>
      <p>“Now he is gradually stepping up walking on the treadmill and biking, so it will still be a few weeks. But we hope to see him in 2019.”</p>
      <p>Pogba's fellow midfielder Scott McTominay, one of United’s best players this season, will also miss <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/sheffield-united-vs-manchester-united-premier-league-time-kick/">the trip to Sheffield United on Sunday</a> as the 22-year-old has not recovered from the ankle knock suffered against Brighton two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer admits that McTominay’s presence at Bramall Lane will be missed but, as the long winter stretch begins, the manager is still looking at narrowing the nine-point distance to the top four. “There is a clear gap,” he says. “But it’s about consistency, and getting as many points on board as we can. But we think we have turned a corner results and performance wise.”</p>
