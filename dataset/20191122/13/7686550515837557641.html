      <h1>How woman used pizza to tell police about domestic violence</h1>
      <h2>She was in urgent need of help</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:35:26+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:35</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Shaw</a></address>
      <p>A woman managed to alert police about ongoing domestic violence by making a call about pizza.</p>
      <p>The woman managed to get the message across that her mother was being attacked, without arousing the suspicions of the attacker.</p>
      <p>The idea of someone calling police and talking about pizza to secretly ask for help is one that has circulated on social media for years - but there are few if any examples of it actually being put to use.</p>
      <p>Now Oregon City police in Ohio have revealed how one of their call handlers has dealt with just such a call.</p>
      <p>Dispatcher Tim Teneyck told 13 ABC news that at first he didn't realise what was going on - until he remembered seeing social media posts.</p>
      <p>He said: "You see it on Facebook, but it's not something that anybody has ever been trained for. Other dispatchers that I've talked to would not have picked up on this. They've told me they wouldn't have picked up on this."</p>
      <p>
        <b>This is an extract from the call:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Mr Teneyck:</b> Oregon 911</p>
      <p><b>Caller:</b> I would like to order a pizza at [address redacted].</p>
      <p><b>Mr Teneyck:</b> You called 911 to order a pizza?</p>
      <p><b>Caller:</b> Uh, yeah. Apartment [redacted].</p>
      <p><b>Mr Teneyck:</b> This is the wrong number to call for a pizza...</p>
      <p><b>Caller:</b> No, no, no. You're not understanding.</p>
      <p><b>Mr Teneyck:</b> I'm getting you now.</p>
      <p><b>Mr Teneyck:</b> Is the other guy still there?</p>
      <p><b>Caller:</b> Yep, I need a large pizza.</p>
      <p><b>Mr Teneyck: </b>Alright. How about medical, do you need medical?</p>
      <p><b>Caller: </b>No. With pepperoni.</p>
      <p>A similar tactic was promoted in a campaign by the Norwegian Women's Shelter Association in 2010, then in 2014 a 911 operator posted on Reddit claiming they had had a similar call.</p>
      <p>The basis of that call was used as an advert about domestic abuse during the Super Bowl in 2015.</p>
      <p>According to the BBC and Associated Press Christopher Carver, dispatch centre operations director for the National Emergency Number Association in the US, says police are not trained to listen out for any specific code words or scenarios.</p>
      <p>In the UK people who cannot talk sometimes dial 999 and remain silent - keying in 55 when the call is answered to let call handlers know your situation is real and serious.</p>
      <p>Leaving the phone off the hook will mean they may be able to hear what is going on.</p>
      <p>It is important to note this won't always mean police are sent to help, or even that they know where you are.</p>
      <p>
        <b>This is from fact checking site fullfact.org:</b>
      </p>
      <p>We asked the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), which deals with police matters across the UK’s police forces, and it told us that when someone calls 999 and doesn’t speak, the BT operators who initially pick up “will try to establish if the call received is genuine by asking questions”.</p>
      <p>It told us that if no one speaks, but the operator hears “suspicious noises or a disturbance”, the call will be forwarded to the police, who will establish if officers are required.</p>
      <p>But if no noise is heard, the BT operator will forward the call to an automated service that will ask the caller to dial 55 which will also route the call to the police. This service is called ‘Silent Solutions’ and has been in use since 2001. Then police call handlers will try and establish if there’s an emergency by asking questions that can be answered by tapping the handset, or with yes or no responses.</p>
      <p>The NPCC told us that dialling 55 at any point in the call (even before prompted) is likely to alert the operator that the caller needs to be put through to the police, as would doing something like tapping the handset to make a noise.</p>
      <h3>There’s no guarantee that typing 55 will get a caller’s location tracked</h3>
      <p>On location tracking, the NPCC told us that calls from landlines can be linked to an address, but calls from mobile phones will only show a general location at the time of the call. The NPCC told us that the police “can’t get exact locations from mobile phone calls because of things like tower blocks or densely populated areas”.</p>
      <p>It added that the police don’t always send officers to silent calls “so it is important for callers to try and provide as much information as they can—in any way they can”. Police will use other information, such as previous calls, to inform their decision on whether to send officers.</p>
      <h3>It’s an ‘urban myth’ that silent calls will always get a response</h3>
      <p>In 2014, Karen Catherall was murdered by a man she had met on a dating site. A silent 999 call lasting 12 seconds was made from her mobile the night she was attacked, but the call wasn’t forwarded to any emergency service.</p>
      <p>A report into her death published in 2018 said that it was an “urban myth” that silent 999 calls always produce an emergency response. The report added that “The volume of silent calls... means that any plan to trace them is not sustainable within the resources likely to be needed.”</p>
      <p>“The other point to make is that whereas a landline can be traced to an address, a mobile would only be traceable to an area covered by a mobile phone...for safety’s sake it is important that the message is given nationally that silent 999 calls, especially from mobiles, are not guaranteed to bring help.”</p>
