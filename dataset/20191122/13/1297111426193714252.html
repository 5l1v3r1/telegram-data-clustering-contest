      <h1>Rob Vanstone: Saskatchewan Roughriders quarterback Cody Fajardo didn't let anyone down</h1>
      <h2>Riders quarterback Cody Fajardo's post-game apology on Sunday was admirable, but unnecessary, considering his contributions to the team.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/football-comes-first-for-the-family-of-saskatchewan-roughriders-quarterback-cody-fajardo">Cody Fajardo</a> experienced the thrill of victory and agony of the tweet.</p>
      <p>During an eventful debut season as a CFL starting quarterback, Fajardo helped <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-clinch-first-place-in-cfl-west-division">the Saskatchewan Roughriders post a 13-5 record and finish first in the West Division</a>.</p>
      <p>But then came Sunday, when <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-poor-play-calling-was-the-saskatchewan-roughriders-undoing">the Green and White lost a 20-13 heartbreaker to the visiting Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the West final.</a></p>
      <p>Shortly thereafter, Fajardo reached out to the fans via Twitter.</p>
      <p>“Thank you #Riderville for accepting me as one of your own,” he wrote on @CodyFajardo17. “We were counted out from the start of the season, &amp; you all stuck with us.</p>
      <p>“I am sorry I let you down tonight. Even though I want to look forward to next year I can’t help but think about how wonderful this year was.”</p>

      <p>I was raised too well to disagree with an exceptional person such as Fajardo, but one sentence, in particular, warrants commentary.</p>
      <p>Fajardo did not let anyone down.</p>
      <p>In fact, he let everyone in — giving fans and media types a chance to get to know someone who is largely an open book.</p>
      <p>Fajardo introduced people to his family members — such as his father (Tim) and wife (Laura) — while answering questions candidly and expansively.</p>
      <p>Rare is the quarterback who will openly discuss the tendencies of rival defences, for example, but Fajardo seldom hesitated to offer a sprinkling of insight into the intricacies of the game — making them digestible for organisms such as yours truly.</p>
      <p>And rare is the Roughrider who is up for CFL most-outstanding-player honours.</p>

      <p>Since the MOP award was introduced in 1953, a Saskatchewan player has been the West’s nominee just 11 times.</p>
      <p>Fajardo is part of an elite group that includes <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/13-facts-about-george-reed-robs-green-time-machine">George Reed</a> (1965, 1968 and 1969), <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/ron-lancasters-legendary-last-game-robs-green-time-machine">Ron Lancaster</a> (1966, 1970, 1976), Ken Carpenter (1955), Robert Mimbs (1996), Corey Holmes (2005) and <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/plaza-of-honour-induction-caps-kerry-josephs-career-with-saskatchewan-roughriders">Kerry Joseph</a> (2007).</p>
      <p>Lancaster won the league’s most prestigious individual award in 1970 and 1976. Reed (1965) and Joseph (2007) were each honoured once.</p>
      <p>Fajardo’s name was not called Thursday night, when the Hamilton Tiger-Cats’ Brandon Banks was decorated as the MOP.</p>

      <p>Overall, the Roughriders were 0-for-3 at the CFL awards presentations. Hamilton’s Orlondo Steinauer got the nod over <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-head-coach-craig-dickenson-moving-on-after-west-division-final-loss">Craig Dickenson</a> for coach of the year. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/shaq-evans-charleston-hughes-naaman-roosevelt-top-lengthy-list-of-saskatchewan-roughriders-pending-free-agents">Cameron Judge</a> was the runner-up to fellow linebacker Henoc Muamba (Montreal Alouettes) in voting for most outstanding Canadian.</p>
      <p>The fact that Saskatchewan had three awards finalists is a reflection of the team’s excellence.</p>
      <p>But how would the season have unfolded if not for the unexpected emergence of Fajardo as a star?</p>
      <p>Just three plays into the 2019 campaign, the Roughriders were already in next-man-up territory at quarterback — due to a concussion suffered by <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/simoni-lawrence-zach-collaros-is-still-my-dude-i-still-like-him-i-still-care-for-him/wcm/c8148399-0ea9-4681-9849-6c09a9615bb2">Zach Collaros.</a></p>
      <p>Fajardo couldn’t save the day — Saskatchewan lost 23-17 to the host Tiger-Cats in the opener — but he did salvage the season … and then some.</p>
      <p>As a first-year starter, he became the first person to quarterback Saskatchewan to at least 12 victories in a season since 1970, when Lancaster was 13-2. (Gary Lane was the quarterback of record in one Saskatchewan victory in 1970. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-ride-rookie-passer-isaac-harker-to-victory">Isaac Harker</a> was the triumphant pivot in the 2019 regular-season finale.)</p>
      <p>Lancaster was named the league’s MOP even though he battled a sore arm in 1970. There were times when he could not practise, but he was nonetheless the league’s premier player.</p>
      <p>Most recently, Fajardo threw for 366 yards on Sunday despite playing with two torn oblique muscles.</p>
      <p>So there isn’t any reason for him to say sorry, or to feel like he let anyone down.</p>
      <p>It is admirable that he would express those thoughts, which demonstrate the degree to which he has embraced the team and its fans.</p>

      <p>Fellow West all-star <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-safety-mike-edem-makes-up-for-late-start-as-football-player">Mike Edem</a> — another exemplary leader — was of a comparable mindset after Sunday’s game.</p>
      <p>“I’m getting too old for the season to be ending like this,” the Roughriders’ 30-year-old safety told reporters at Mosaic Stadium. “It’s going to be a tough one.</p>
      <p>“This one might hurt more than anyone maybe because we had first place, we had a week off, and we didn’t pull through for the fans.</p>
      <p>“Riderville, I’m sorry.”</p>
      <p>Edem’s apology was sincere and honourable, but unnecessary. The same can be said of the heartfelt words that Fajardo disseminated via Twitter.</p>
      <p>If not for their franchise quarterback, especially, the Roughriders truly would have been in a sorry state.</p>
