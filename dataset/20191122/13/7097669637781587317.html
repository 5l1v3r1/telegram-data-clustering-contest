      <h1>Otto Warmbier’s Parents Will Work to Have North Korean Assets Seized</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:48:02+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.nationalreview.com/" target="_blank">Zachary Evans</a></address>
      <p>The parents of former U.S. hostage Otto Warmbier, who died in 2017 after being released from North Korea in a coma, have announced they will attempt to seize North Korean business assets around the world to punish the country’s government over its human-rights abuses.</p>
      <p>Otto Warmbier was convicted in a North Korean court after he tried to steal a propaganda poster from his hotel. He was released to the U.S. in a vegetative state a year later.</p>
      <p>Otto’s parents have alleged he was tortured. North Korea has denied the allegations, asserting it was the “biggest victim” in Otto’s death and, without evidence, attributing Warmbier’s death to botulism.</p>
      <p>“My mission would be to hold North Korea responsible, to recover and discover their assets around the world,” Fred Warmbier said at a Friday press <a href="https://apnews.com/8caa106ec9344c598b4ec9030a16c7a2">conference</a> in Seoul, South Korea, according to the Associated Press. Fred and his wife Cindy had been invited to speak at a forum for a group representing South Korean families whose members were abducted by North Korea over the course of the 1950-53 Korean War.</p>
      <p>“We feel that if you force North Korea to engage the world in a legal standpoint, then they will have to ultimately have a dialogue,” he continued. “They are not going to come and have a dialogue with us any other way.”</p>
      <p>The Warmbiers plan to pressure European governments to close hostels run by North Korea. They are already pursuing legal action against a hostel on the grounds of North Korea’s embassy in Berlin.</p>
      <p>“We cannot give up, we can’t give them a pass. We have to fight with all of our power,” Cindy Warmbier said at the conference.</p>
      <p>President Trump has <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/north-korea-announces-new-nuclear-talks-with-us/">repeatedly</a> sought to negotiate the removal of nuclear weapons from North Korea, and became the first American president to meet with a North Korean leader during negotiations. Those negotiations are currently <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/05/north-korea-summit-cancelled-good-riddance/">stalled</a>.</p>
