      <p>Reprieve has come the way of detained National Security Adviser (NSA), Colonel Mohammed Dasuki (retired) as the Court of Appeal in Abuja acceded on Friday to his request for a variation in the terms attached to the bail earlier granted him.</p>
      <p>In a unanimous judgement, three-man panel of the court expunged the requirement that Dasuki produced a Level 16 civil servant who must own a property worth N100 million within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).</p>
      <p>Justice Stephen Adah, in the lead judgment, said it was wrong for courts to require civil servants to stand as surety when bail is granted.</p>
