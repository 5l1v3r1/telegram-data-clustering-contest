      <p>The HRD ministry-appointed panel reached the JNU campus on Friday to hold talks with the students regarding their disputes with the administration on the hostel fee hike issue.</p>
      <p>The panel members entered the university from another gate as students had formed a human chain inside the varsity campus to demand complete rollback of fee hike, ahead of the visit.</p>
      <p>“Students are standing here to welcome the high powered committee. The students want to tell them about the issues arising due to fee hike, former students’ union president N Sai Balaji had said ahead of the panel’s visit.</p>
      <p>The HRD Ministry had formed the three-member committee on Monday to recommend ways to restore normal functioning of the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/jawaharlal-nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> University and mediate between the administration and students who have been protesting for over three weeks over the hostel fee hike.</p>
      <p>The first meeting of the panel with JNU Students Union (JNUSU) office-bearers, student counsellors and hostel presidents took place on Wednesday at HRD Ministry. The panel has also met JNU Teachers Association (JNUTA) members and Deans of all schools.</p>
