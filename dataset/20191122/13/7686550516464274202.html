      <h2>Mum-of-three upcycled a chest of drawers from Ikea and used paint instead of wallpaper to keep costs low</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:19:50+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:19</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, Nisha Mal</a></address>
      <p>A mum-of-three transformed her dino-crazy son's bedroom into a real life Jurassic Park using bargains she got from Primark, Wilko and Argos.</p>
      <p>Stacey Jones, from Manchester, wanted to create a dinosaur-themed bedroom for her little boy, but with a tight budget she knew she had to get creative.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old made over her son's room by painting mountains on the walls and upcycling a chest of drawers from Ikea.</p>
      <p>"His bedroom is only small so painting mountains on the wall instead of using wallpaper kept the cost low and the room feeling light even though I’ve used green tones which could easily have made the room feel smaller," Stacey told money-saving site <a href="https://latestdeals.co.uk/">LatestDeals.co.uk.</a></p>

      <p>"All the DIY was done by myself including the upcycle of the Ikea chest of drawers; I painted those in the same shades as the mountains on the wall and added plastic toy dinosaurs as the handles."</p>
      <p>Stacey also went to Primark for dinosaur bedding for £9, and bought a dino cuddly toy for Argos for £2.25.</p>
      <p>She was also keen to not over-do things, "I wanted a lot of natural tones and fabrics to compliment so the use of jute and wicker and the natural pine bed really stands out against the green," she said.</p>
      <p>"Foliage and lights were added to the teepee bed and the dino feet stickers on the floor add to the dino jungle theme."</p>
      <p>And Stacey has some advice for people looking to pull off a similar make over.</p>

      <p>“My tips would be to use the same paint used on the walls to up cycle the drawers to keep costs low, and also to keep everything matching," she said.</p>
      <p>"Don’t buy expensive drawer handles - I'd seen dinosaur ones for around £30 to £40 and I managed to make my own for £6.</p>
      <p>"Source cheap artificial plants that you can cut up and use as the foliage on the bed frame as it works out much cheaper than buying the longs strands of faux ivy and so on.</p>
      <p>"I feel so proud of what I managed to achieve on a small budget and best of all I got the seal of approval from Huey who tells me he loves his dinosaur bedroom every day!” Stacey said.</p>
