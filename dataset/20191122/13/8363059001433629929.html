      <p>You'd think today was Black Friday, by the way all the retailers are pushing their deals onto us so quickly. Sadly we still have a week to go before the day itself arrives, though that doesn't mean we can't have a gander and see how much money we could save on things we may or may not need.</p>
      <p>The latest to send through some new offers if Carphone Warehouse, <a href="https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/">as part of its Black Tag event.</a> Because saying Black Friday is too uncool, I assume.
