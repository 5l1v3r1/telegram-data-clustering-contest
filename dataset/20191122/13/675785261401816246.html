      <p>The warehouse bargains online are made up of returned, warehouse-damaged, used, or refurbished products that are in good condition but do not meet the required standards to be sold as "new" by the online retail giant.</p>
      <p>It's an ideal option for anyone who is looking for a high-priced tech or electrical items for a fraction of the normal retail price and who doesn't mind picking up a 'like new' version.</p>
