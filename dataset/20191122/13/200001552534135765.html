      <h1>Mourinho ‘has called’ striker to ‘convince him to return to the PL’ – Potential golden opportunity for January</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:16:08+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/tom-coast/" target="_blank">Tom Coast</a></address>
      <p>When the Italian and the English press agree on something, it’s worth paying attention to it, which is currently the case regarding Zlatan Ibrahimovic and a move to Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Nothing concrete appears to be happening just yet, as the Swede and his agent Mino Raiola weigh up all their options for the time being, but José Mourinho’s arrival at Spurs has set a wheel in motion few could have imagined turning just a week ago.</p>
      <p>With no backup for Harry Kane and Ibrahimovic now 38, the pairing could be ideal for the rest of the season, and perhaps a bit longer depending on how he does.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.repubblica.it/index.html?refresh_ce">La Repubblica</a> in Italy state ‘the Special one has called Zlatan to convince him to return to the Premier League’, which a step further than what the English media are reporting.</p>

      <p>There will undoubtedly be plenty of question marks at Tottenham regarding this deal, as we all know the former Manchester United striker will not be demanding low wages, regardless of his age, fully confident in his ability to succeed, as always.</p>
      <p>We’ll have to wait on this one, as it’s been reported no transfer activity will take place in January on the Spurs side of things, but if a golden opportunity does arise, it might be too good to turn down.</p>
