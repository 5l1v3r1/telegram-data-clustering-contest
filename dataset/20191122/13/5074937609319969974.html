      <p>Yendi (NR) Nov. 22, GNA - Alhaji Hammed Abubakari Yussuf, the Yendi Municipal Chief Executive (MCE) has applauded the Ghana Catholic Bishops Conference for taking steps to launch and sensitise the citizenry on Government policies.</p>
      <p>He said the move was a mark of good leadership and civic responsibility to the state and must be emulated by other institutions.</p>
      <p>Alhaji Abubakari gave the commendation in an address read on his behalf during the launch of a sensitisation  programme on the upcoming referendum and District level elections organised by the Bishops Conference in collaboration with Catholic Diocese of Yendi in the Northern Region.</p>
      <p>He said the theme: “Participating of Political Parties and citizenry in the District Level Elections” was appropriately selected because the foundation of democracy was citizens’ participation in the decision making process of the country.</p>
      <p>The MCE said in view of their contributions, the NCCE was making conscious efforts to sensitise the public on the referendum and other related issues and reminded them that it was important to appreciate that peace as wealth, of it which everyone must recognize.</p>
      <p>The Most Vincent sowah Boi-Na, Catholic Bishop of  the Yendi Diocese indicated that the 1992 Constitution of Ghana requirement was essential as it offered the voting population the right to decide on persons who offered themselves for leaderships to be elected.</p>
      <p>He said the Catholic Church was part of Ghana’s socio-economic development agenda in various forms.</p>
      <p>He mentioned some of the areas as the Justice and Peace Commission (JPC) of National Catholic Secretariat of the Ghana Catholic Bishops’ Conference.</p>
      <p>He said the Catholic Social Teachings hold the view that political agenda must never lose sight of creating social structures that would guarantee the political participation of all the citizenry for responsibility.</p>
      <p>He said in line with the concept of local governance, the Catholic Social Teaching advocates principles of participation and subsidiarity.</p>
      <p>Bishop Boi-Nai therefore called on Ghanaians to come out on 17th December 2019 to vote during the referendum .</p>
      <p>Mr. Peter Atia, the Secretary of Yendi Peace Centre said 100 participants were drawn from Yendi, Tatale, Gushegu, Saboba, Zabzugu, Bimbilla, Wulensi, Chamba, Sanbuli and Sang Parishes.</p>
      <p>The rest, he said were Gnani, Bincheratanga and Sang Parishes attended the launching ceremony.</p>
