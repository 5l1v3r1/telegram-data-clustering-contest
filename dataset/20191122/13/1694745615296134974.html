      <p>Your <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/family/When-Does-Elf-Shelf-Come-Back-45432164">Elf on the Shelf may not have made its first appearance</a> yet this year, but tell your kids they'll still want to make sure they're on the nice list — IHOP is going to have an <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Elf-on-the-Shelf">Elf on the Shelf</a>-themed menu filled with delicious items for your whole crew. From fluffy green Jolly Cakes topped with cream-cheese icing to a delectable hot chocolate topped with marshmallow syrup, whipped cream, and "elf sprinkles," everything on this menu is a serious treat. A bonus? Kids under 12 eat free through the holiday season with the purchase of an adult entrée between the hours of 4 and 10 p.m.</p>
      <p>Ahead, get a peek at the menu, which is available now through Jan. 1, 2020, at participating IHOP locations.</p>
