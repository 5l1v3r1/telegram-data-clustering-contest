      <p><b>India vs Bangladesh 2nd Test, Day 1 Live Score Update:</b> Indian pace trio of Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav and Mohammad Shami rattled Bangladesh batting order in the first innings of historic day/night Test match at Kolkata’s Eden Gardens on Friday. Electing to bat first after winning the toss, none of the Bangladeshi batsmen looked comfortable against the pace and bounce of the Indian fast bowlers and the whole team bundled out for a paltry 106 runs. Ishant Sharma took five wickets giving away just 22 runs in 12 overs. Umesh Yadav took three while Shami picked one.</p>
      <p>For Bangladesh, only opener Shadman Islam provided some resistance scoring 29 runs before Yadav made him to nick one behind the stumps. Liton Das played well for his 24 hitting five fours before being retired hurt after he was hit by bouncer by Mohammad Shami. Wicketkeeper Das was replaced by  Mehidy Hasan as concussion substitute. Hasan, an off-spinner will, however, won’t be allowed to bowl in the match as per the new substitute rule.</p>

Kolkata has virtually turned pink for the match with the local man and BCCI president Sourav Ganguly supervising all the preparations. The build-up to the match has been enormous as tickets for the first four days have already been sold out.</p>
