      <p>FORT MYERS, Fla. -- The holidays are a tough time for children who are coping with the loss of a loved one, and that's why a local organization is trying to raise awareness about children's grief.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.valerieshouseswfl.org/">Valerie's House</a> had a grief support group Thursday night, so they could talk about the holidays.</p>
      <p>The kids created memory boxes for the loved ones they have lost.</p>
      <p>1 in 14 Florida children will experience the death of a parent or a sibling by the time they're 18 years old.</p>
      <p>“It's important, grieving is important. And being able to do it the right way and not thinking you're alone, it's the best thing,” says Josselin Calderon, teen ambassador at Valerie’s House.</p>
      <p>The center says without support and learning how to cope, kids are at a higher risk for emotional and behavioral issues down the road.</p>
      <p>The group is building a facility in Fort Myers to help reach even more families.</p>
