      <p>The Scottish SPCA is appealing for information after an abandoned puppy was found in Hamilton.</p>
      <p>A member of the public discovered the dog huddling in a box on Monday, November 18.</p>
      <p>The animal rescue charity say that the pooch, who they have called Beans, is lucky to be alive.</p>
      <p>Animal rescue officer Sarah Parker said, “The dog was found in a cardboard box, lined with a blanket, at a local park near to Quarry Street.</p>
      <p>“The young dog, which we believe is a Jack Russell terrier cross, is male and is around eight weeks old.</p>
      <p>“We are grateful to the member of the public who took him in and kept him safe overnight.</p>

      <p>“He is friendly so we suspect he is used to human contact.</p>
      <p>“One of our animal rescue and rehoming centres is providing the care he needs.</p>
      <p>“The team have affectionately named him Beans.</p>
      <p>“The night in question was the coldest so far this year and temperatures were below freezing. Had he not been found, Beans would have almost certainly died so we are keen to find out the circumstances surrounding how he came to be in the park.</p>
      <p>“If anyone has any information, we would urge them to call our confidential animal helpline on 03000 999 999.”</p>
      <p>Abandoning an animal is an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006. Anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or life.</p>
