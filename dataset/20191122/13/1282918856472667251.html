      <p>Samson took to Twitter on Friday to respond to his exclusion and posted a ‘smiley face’ without any text. The right-hander who was in stellar form in the recently concluded Vijay Hazare Trophy did not get to play a single game in the three-T20I series against Bangladesh.</p>
      <h3>Here's a look at Samson's Tweet</h3>

      <p>With Virat Kohli's return to the side, Samson has been left out. Manish Pandey gets a longer run in the T20I side. The selectors have once again shown faith in Rishabh Pant despite his dismal performances in the recent past. </p>
      <p>He has scored 112 runs from four games he played for Kerala in the ongoing Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2019. The Rajasthan Royals star batsman last played a T20I in 2015 against Zimbabwe batting at No.7 and scoring 19 runs from 24 deliveries.</p>
      <p>His fans tried to guess what he might be implying through his Tweet and came to support the Kerala wicket-keeper. Let us have a look at a few Tweets.</p>
