      <h1>French Montana in hospital after cops visited house and saw him acting strange</h1>
      <h2>French has been admitted to an LA hospital for reportedly suffering stomach pains, nausea and an elevated heart rate after police called him an ambulance</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:06:48+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:06</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/french-montana">French Montana</a> is reportedly is hospital after cops called him an ambulance.</p>
      <p>Officers in the Calabasas area, where French lives, are said to have responded to a call about a possible robbery at the rapper's home.</p>
      <p>It was a false alarm - but it's reported the officers noticed something wasn't right.</p>
      <p>French - real name Karim Kharbouch - is said to have been acting abnormally, with sources close to French telling <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/21/french-montana-hospitalized-heart-rate-elevated-stomach-pain/">TMZ</a> that he'd been experiencing stomach pains, nausea and an elevated heart rate.</p>
      <p>A source also told the website that he was admitted to San Fernando Valley Hospital, and that close pals reckon he may have been exposed to contaminated food.</p>

      <p>The rapper's internationally renowned and respected, and his latest bout of travelling saw him jetting all over Europe and the Middle East.</p>
      <p>French is known for a huge range of songs including Famous and No Stylist, in which he raps alongside Drake.</p>
      <p>He's also noted for his dating past, which includes none other than <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/khloe-kardashian">Khloe Kardashian</a> .</p>
      <p>It was thought that earlier this year, Khloe turned to her ex following her split from NBA player and father of her child, Tristan Thompson.</p>
      <p>A source told Hollywood Life: "Khloe has been leaning on her ex French in the last few months.</p>
      <p>"French is someone that Khloe has always been able to trust and talk about things."</p>

      <p>They added: "Khloe always felt that French had her best interests at heart and will forever respect him and what he has to say.</p>
      <p>"It's too soon to see if sparks will ever fly again between the two as it isn't out of the realm of possibility, but Khloe needs him more as a friend right now and they are both OK with that."</p>
      <p>The rapper made some serious waves when he claimed he could have saved the life of Mac Miller, a fellow rapper who was found dead at his home last year from a drug overdose.</p>
      <p>He said: "I feel like I have people that if I do something like that, like how I was to him, like a big brother, more like, 'You bugging me out', he didn't have that around him.</p>
      <p>"So if I did it that night, if I'd been around him a couple more nights, I would've made him stop, but he didn't have nobody who was doing that."</p>
