      <h1>Eden Hazard's final flourish at Chelsea as his Real Madrid dream became a reality</h1>
      <h2>The latest in football.london's end of decade series looks back at the day Eden Hazard left Chelsea to join Real Madrid</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:00:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Warlow</a></address>
      <p>It was a day that no Chelsea fan wanted to come, but the transfer saga that was Eden Hazard’s move to Real Madrid finally came to an end on June 7 this year.</p>
      <p>The Belgium international brought his seven-year spell with <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> to a close, joining boyhood hero Zinedine Zidane at Real Madrid as he signed a long-term deal until 2024.</p>
      <p>And in the latest of our end of decade series on <b>football.london</b>, we look back at Hazard's farewell from Chelsea and what it meant for the club.</p>
      <p>When the day finally came for Hazard to leave Chelsea, it could hardly be described as unexpected.</p>
      <p>After all, the Spanish giants had been courting his services for a long time, with constant speculation that the Belgian would be leaving to join Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Hazard himself admitted that he had stayed one more year at Chelsea.</p>
      <p>“It is true that everything began last year, after the World Cup,” he said after completing his move.</p>
      <p>“But I stayed one more year at Chelsea. I think things went very well personally, and also with the team, winning the Europa League. This is the perfect time to join Real Madrid.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/eden-hazard">Hazard</a>, who joined Chelsea from Lille in 2012 in a deal worth around £32million, bowed out in style in the Europa League final by scoring a brace in a 4-1 victory over London rivals Arsenal in Baku, lifting a final trophy with the <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/">Blues</a>, after also winning the Premier League twice, both the FA Cup and EFL Cup once and the Europa League back in 2013 as well.</p>

      <p>He tormented the Arsenal defenders in the final - as he had done before in a Chelsea shirt - helping to guide Chelsea to victory and in the process, wreck Arsenal's dream of a return to the Champions League.</p>
      <p>But that final flourish in Baku did not make his departure any easier for Blues fans though, amid a FIFA-imposed transfer ban that left Chelsea unable to enter the market for a replacement.</p>
      <p>Chelsea did receive a sizeable fee as part of the deal, which was worth around £88.5million, before add-ons and bonuses, with the overall transfer worth up to €150 million.</p>
      <p>Hazard joined Madrid on the back of an impressive campaign for the west London outfit, having scored 16 goals in the Premier League and 21 in all competitions, along with 15 assists.</p>
      <p>His highest goal contribution in a single Premier League campaign wasn't enough to earn him a place in the PFA Premier League Team of the Season, but the forward did make history at the Chelsea end of season awards.</p>
      <p>Named Player of the Year as well as Players’ Player of the Year and also won Goal of the Season award for his stunning goal against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup - the first Blues player to collect all three awards in the same year.</p>

      <p>He was also named in Uefa's Europa League squad of the season and signed off by inspiring the Blues to Europa League glory, six years after achieving the same feat at the end of his first season with the club.</p>
      <p>In total, he scored 110 goals in 352 appearances for the Blues, firmly establishing himself as a hero for the fans as he dazzled with his skill, creativity and clinical finishing in front of goal.</p>
      <p>But when he was presented in front of 50,000 Real Madrid fans at the Bernabeu six days after his move was completed, Hazard admitted that he had always wanted to play for the La Liga giants, while he also kissed the badge on his new shirt to leave some Chelsea fans heartbroken.</p>

      <p>There was no denying that this was his dream move though, as he stated himself at his presentation in Madrid.</p>
      <p>“I look forward to putting on the shirt and defending this club,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Since I was a child, it was a dream to play for this club.</p>
      <p>“I was a kid playing football in the garden with my brothers when I began to be a Real Madrid fan.</p>
      <p>“I believe everyone knows that Zidane was my idol since I was a kid. That he is now Real Madrid coach was an important factor, but not just that. I already wanted to play here.</p>

      <p>“I don’t think it is too late, I am 28 years old, the top moment for a player. I have had various stages in my career, Lille, Chelsea, now I felt the time was right to join the best club in the world.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Real Madrid president Florentino Perez shared a stage with the Belgian superstar, hailing the 28-year-old after his big-money move.</p>
      <p>“Eden, you are where you wanted to be. This was your dream, your dream has come true and you are here to defend the shirt,” he said.</p>
      <p>But while Hazard was unquestionably one of the best players to play for Chelsea in recent times, he said himself that he still had plenty to prove at one of the biggest clubs in the world.</p>
      <p>“I will try to be [part of] the best team in the world, not just best player. It is a different level," he said.</p>
      <p>“I had a lot of success with Chelsea, I want to win a lot as well with Madrid. Just to be here is a new challenge, but I am ready for that.</p>
      <p>“I’m not a Galactico, not yet. I hope I will be one day. Despite everything I have done in the past, it will be like beginning from zero. I’m not a Galactico, just a very good player.”</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for the Belgian, it hasn't worked out just yet in Madrid, with injuries hampering him at the start of the season.</p>
      <p>He has since played 11 times in all competitions for Zidane's side, but has only scored one goal, and as yet, has not been able to replicate the form he showed in his seven years in west London.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, his former team-mates have flourished under the guidance of Frank Lampard, with Chelsea currently sat third in the Premier League after 12 games, with young players such as Mason Mount, Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori starring for the Blues.</p>
      <p>Experienced players like Willian, Jorginho and Cesar Azpilicueta have played their part too, and Chelsea do not look to be missing Hazard, despite him being the talisman for the side in recent seasons.</p>
      <p>Chelsea fans will only hope that trend continues after a fine start to the Lampard era at Stamford Bridge.</p>
