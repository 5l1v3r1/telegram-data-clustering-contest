      <p>The question of the banking union in the European Union has to be tackled now, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz argued on Friday. "We have 2 or 3 years to negotiate and then 2 more years to formulate the legal text," Scholz explained. </p>
      <p>Scholz refrained from commenting on Germany's economic outlook and his remarks were largely ignored by the market participants.</p>
