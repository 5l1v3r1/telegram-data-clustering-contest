        <li>
          <b>It has had a powerful role in defining what sexy is in the modern day via its racy lingerie and annual runway shows.</b>
        </li>
        <li>But after achieving explosive success in the late 1990s and 2000s, the brand has struggled in more recent years and has been accused of losing relevance.</li>

      <p>You’d be hard-pressed to find anyone in the US who hasn’t come into contact with Victoria’s Secret in one way or another. Since the late 1990s, Victoria’s Secret has been one of the best-known and most talked-about brands in the country – <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/victorias-secret-rough-2018-what-went-wrong-2018-12?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">increasingly,</a> not in ways that it might hope for.</p>
      <p>But it has had a powerful role in defining what sexy is in the modern day via its racy lingerie and annual runway shows and in its heyday, these enabled the company to achieve blockbuster sales and reach global status.</p>
      <p>Increasingly, the tide seems to be turning. Sales have slipped, customers are complaining that quality has dropped, and analysts are becoming more skeptical about the brand’s future if it refuses to adapt in the era of #MeToo.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the company faced a new challenge after it was caught up in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. Victoria’s Secret is owned by a retail company called L Brands, and Epstein previously managed the money of L Brands CEO and founder, Les Wexner. The two were <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jeffrey-epstein-les-wexner-art-lawsuit-family-portrait-2019-7?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">reportedly</a> once <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/victorias-secret-employees-what-les-wexner-is-like-as-boss-2019-8">close friends</a>. Epstein also reportedly tried to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/epstein-flourished-as-he-forged-bond-with-retail-billionaire-11562975711?mod=article_inline">meddle in Victoria’s Secret’s business,</a> offering input on which women should be models and <a href="https://nypost.com/2007/10/18/i-was-teen-prey-of-pervert-tycoon/?source=post_page---------------------------">using his connection to Victoria’s Secret</a> to coerce them into sexual acts.</p>
      <p>Among the chaos, there have been some <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/victorias-secret-makes-changes-to-image-2019-8?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T#it-reportedly-hired-its-first-transgender-model-3">potentially positive changes this year</a>, however – Victoria’s Secret <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/victorias-secret-hires-first-transgender-model-valentina-sampaio-2019-8?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">hired its first-ever openly</a> transgender model, its longtime marketing chief stepped down. On Thursday, the company <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/victorias-secret-cancels-fashion-show-its-official-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">confirmed</a> that it had officially canceled its runway show this year.</p>

      <h3>Victoria’s Secret was founded in 1977 by American businessman Roy Raymond.</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Inspired by an uncomfortable trip to a department store to buy underwear for his wife, Raymond set out to create a place where men would feel comfortable shopping for lingerie. He wanted to create a women’s underwear shop that was targeted at men.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>He named the brand after the Victorian era in England, wanting to evoke the refinement of this period in his lingerie.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2016/04/04/57028c4d91058422008ba710.jpg"/>

      <p>His vision was summed up by <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/when_big_businesses_were_small/2013/10/victoria_s_secret_founding_roy_raymond_had_a_great_idea_but_les_wexner_was.2.html">Slate’s Naomi Barr</a> in 2013: “Raymond imagined a Victorian boudoir, replete with dark wood, oriental rugs, and silk drapery. He chose the name ‘Victoria’ to evoke the propriety and respectability associated with the Victorian era; outwardly refined, Victoria’s ‘secrets’ were hidden beneath.”</p>
      <p>He went on to open a handful of Victoria’s Secret stores and launched its famous catalog.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>By 1982, the company was making more than $4 million in annual sales, but according to reports, it was nearing bankruptcy at the time. It was at this point that Les Wexner swooped in.</h3>

      </p>
      <p>Wexner, who founded L Brands (formerly Limited Brands) was already making a name for himself in the retail world as he gradually built up an impressive empire.</p>
      <p>By June 1982, Limited – which had previously acquired Express and Lane Bryant – was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. <a href="https://www.lb.com/our-company/about-us">One month later</a>, under Wexner’s leadership, the company acquired Victoria’s Secret’s six stores and its catalog for $1 million.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Wexner turned Raymond’s vision on its head, creating a store that was focused on women rather than men.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>He was closely following the European lingerie market of that time and wanted to bring this aesthetic to the US. So, he set out to create a more affordable version of European upscale brand “La Perla” – lingerie that looked luxurious and expensive but was affordable.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>And it worked. By the early 1990s, Victoria’s Secret had become the largest lingerie retailer in the US, with 350 stores nationally and sales topping $1 billion.</h3>

      </p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The brand began to cement its image over the next few years. In 1995, its famous annual Fashion Show was born.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.sg/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The show, which was run by Ed Razek (now chief marketing officer of L Brands), became an iconic part of the brand’s image.</p>
      <p>Razek and his team were responsible for hand-picking the models to walk the show. Because of this, he became one of the most important people in the modeling world, helping to launch the careers of Gisele Bündchen, Tyra Banks, and Heidi Klum.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>In 1999, the show aired for the first time online. Time described it as the ‘internet-breaking moment’ of this era after 1.5 million viewers tried to tune in and crashed the site.</h3>

      <h3>Meanwhile, the brand was also launching some of its best-known and most successful products, including its heavily padded Miracle Bra and Body by Victoria.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Body by Victoria was a “blockbuster success” and more than doubled the sales volume of any other bra that Victoria’s Secret had previously launched, Michael Silverstein wrote in his book, “Trading Up.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Around this time (1997), the idea of the Victoria’s Secret ‘Angel’ came into play after a commercial featuring Helena Christensen, Karen Mulder, Daniela Peštová, Stephanie Seymour, and Tyra Banks ran to promote its “Angels” underwear collection.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>From then on, the term “Angel” become synonymous with the brand.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Throughout the ’90s and early 2000s, its commercials featured heavily made-up and scantily dressed Angels.</h3>

      <hr/>
      <h3>The runway shows became more lavish. In 2000, model Gisele Bündchen walked the runway in what was then the most expensive item of lingerie ever created, a $15 million diamond-and-ruby-encrusted ‘Fantasy Bra.’</h3>

      <hr/>
      <h3>She became CEO of the whole brand in 2006. Under her nine-year tenure, the company thrived; sales increased by 70% to $7.7 billion.</h3>

      <p>Wexner made a series of quick and fast changes: killing the catalog, swimwear, and apparel to focus solely on lingerie, the core part of its business.</p>
      <p>He also split the brand <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/victorias-secret-announces-restructuring-and-layoffs-2016-4">into three</a> – Victoria’s Secret Lingerie, Victoria’s Secret Beauty, and Pink – and recruited a CEO for each division.</p>

      <h3>Singer was replaced by John Mehas, who took over the role at the start of 2019.</h3>

        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.sg/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Mehas had his work cut out for him. Same-store sales at Victoria’s Secret were down 3% in 2018, and was gradually losing market share to new companies.</p>
      <p>Plus, he had angry shareholders to deal with. In March, activist shareholder Barington Capital sent a letter to Wexner, laying out recommendations to improve growth at <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/victorias-secret">Victoria’s Secret</a> in order to “unlock substantial value.”</p>
      <p>In the letter, Barington’s CEO, James A. Mitarotonda, called out the company’s brand image as being “outdated.”</p>
      <p>“Victoria’s Secret’s brand image is starting to appear to many as being outdated and even a bit ‘tone deaf’ by failing to be aligned with women’s evolving attitudes towards beauty, diversity, and inclusion,” he wrote.</p>

      </p>

      <p>It seems Victoria’s Secret has taken this criticism on board. After acknowledging the letter in a statement, it appointed two new female board directors – Sarah E. Nash and Anne Sheehan – and made steps to address the comments about the brand image being outdated.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>It hired a more body-inclusive model.</h3>

      <blockquote><i>SO LONG PARTNERS <br/></i><i> </i><i>With the exception of Les, I’ve been with L Brands longer than anyone. I’ve loved every minute of it, and every one of you. I’ve appreciated your partnership, your energy, your teamwork, and your enthusiasm. You are, every one of you, a joy to work with, and a joy to be with. The best partners anyone could ever hope for. And I’ve loved coming to work here, every single day, for many, many years. </i><i/> <i>But all good things must and do, inevitably, come to an end. </i><i/> <i>A few weeks ago, I shared with Les my desire to retire sometime around mid August. It was a tough conversation to have because, as some of you must know, we have shared so much together for so many years. Including a deep love of this business. Still, it’s time.</i><i> </i><i>I want to thank all of you for the smiles, the hellos, the laughs, the mission. I could not be more lucky than to have been with all of you at this extraordinary and quite singular organization. I truly hope you know, deep in your hearts, how very special this place is. I do – more than ever. </i><i/> <i>Much love and respect to you all. <br/></i><i>Ed Razek</i></blockquote>

      <h3>And on November 21, the company confirmed that it has officially canceled its runway fashion show this year.</h3>

      <p>During a call with analysts after reporting its third-quarter earnings results, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/victorias-secret-cancels-fashion-show-its-official-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">L Brands CFO Stuart Burgdoerfer responded to a question about whether the fashion show</a> would run this holiday season.</p>
      <p>“We will be communicating to customers, but nothing similar in magnitude to the fashion show,” he said.</p>
      <p>Wexner previously told employees in May that the Victoria’s Secret was “rethinking” the show. And <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/victorias-secret-model-says-fashion-show-cancelled-report-2019-7?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">Victoria’s Secret model</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/victorias-secret-model-says-fashion-show-cancelled-report-2019-7?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">Shanina Shaik</a> – who has walked in several of its fashion shows – told The Daily Telegraph in Australia in July that the annual show was off this year.</p>

      <h3>While these may be potentially positive changes, the brand has found itself caught up in a new challenge: its CEO and the company being linked to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</h3>

      <p>Epstein managed the money of Wexner for several years, and former company executives told The Wall Street Journal that he tried to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/epstein-flourished-as-he-forged-bond-with-retail-billionaire-11562975711?mod=article_inline">meddle in Victoria’s Secret’s business,</a> offering input on which women should be models.</p>
      <p>Some of Epstein’s victims have also come forward saying that he <a href="https://nypost.com/2007/10/18/i-was-teen-prey-of-pervert-tycoon/?source=post_page---------------------------">used his connection to Victoria’s Secret</a> to coerce them into sexual acts.</p>
      <p>L Brands’ board of directors <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/victorias-secret-board-investigates-jeffrey-epstein-connection-2019-7">hired an outside law firm to review its relationship</a> with Epstein. In September, Wexner addressed his ties to Epstein at L Brands’ investor meeting.</p>
      <p>“At some point in your life we are all betrayed by friends,” Wexner said. “Being taken advantage of by someone who was so sick, so cunning, so depraved, is something that I’m embarrassed I was even close to. But that is in the past.”</p>
