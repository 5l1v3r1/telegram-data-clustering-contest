      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/"><b>Barcelona</b></a> sporting director <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eric-abidal/"><b>Eric Abidal</b></a> is reportedly keen to bring <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/"><b>Chelsea</b></a> centre-back <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andreas-christensen/"><b>Andreas Christensen</b></a> to the club in next summer's transfer window.</h2>

      <p>The Spanish side are short of first-team options in central defence with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/samuel-umtiti/"><b>Samuel Umtiti</b></a> struggling to overcome a knee problem and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jean-clair-todibo/"><b>Jean-Clair Todibo</b></a> finding it difficult to settle at the club.</p>
      <p>As a result, head coach <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ernesto-valverde/"><b>Ernesto Valverde</b></a> has not been given much of an opportunity to rest first-choice pairing <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gerard-pique/"><b>Gerard Pique</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/clement-lenglet/"><b>Clement Lenglet</b></a> during the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Mundo Deportivo</i>, Christensen has emerged as a target for the Catalan giants, who will also look to sign a new full-back and striker ahead of the 2020-21 season.</p>
      <p>Christensen has not turned out for Chelsea in the Premier League since the end of September due to injury, although he did make the bench against Crystal Palace before the international break.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old will see his current deal at Stamford Bridge expire in the summer of 2022.</p>
