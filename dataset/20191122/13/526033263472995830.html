      <p>Ten men found alive inside a truck trailer outside London have been arrested on suspicion of committing immigration offenses.</p>
      <p>At around 6:10 pm on Thursday, the Essex police were called to a section of highway near the town of Waltham Abbey, about 16 miles north of London. They received reports of people inside the truck trailer, police told ABC News in a statement.</p>
      <p>The police found 10 men in the rear of the trailer. One man was taken to a hospital for medical treatment and all were arrested on suspicion of immigration offenses. They will be referred to Immigration Enforcement, the Essex police said.</p>
      <p>The driver of the truck has also been arrested, although police said he had been released under supervision. The Essex Police will continue to investigate the case, they said.</p>

      <p>This incident is the latest in a series of recent cases of people being allegedly smuggled across Europe in tractor-trailers.</p>
      <p>In a separate incident, the Irish police reported that 16 men were found in the back of a truck trailer on a ferry traveling to Ireland from France on the same day as the London discovery. The Gardaí (Irish police) said in a <a href="https://www.garda.ie/en/about-us/our-departments/office-of-corporate-communications/press-releases/2019/november/update-investigation-into-immigration-offences-in-rosslare-wexford-on-the-21-11-19.html">statement</a> that they “believe that all the men are of Middle Eastern origin and are adults, but Gardaí continue to confirm the age of one man who may be a juvenile,” and have launched an investigation. They said it had been a traumatic experience for the men, and "they are being treated with sympathy and compassion."</p>
      <p>Last month, the U.K. was shocked by a case of 39 Vietnamese people found dead in a tractor-trailer at an industrial park in the town of Grays in Essex, about 20 miles east of London. The Essex police <a href="https://www.essex.police.uk/news/essex/news/news/2019/october/murder-investigation-launched-after-39-people-found-dead-in-lorry-container/">called it</a> the “largest murder investigation in our force’s history.”</p>
      <p>A week after the 39 victims were found in Essex, on Oct. 30, the Belgian police found 12 men in the back of a fruit and vegetable truck, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/30/belgian-police-find-12-people-safe-and-well-in-refrigerated-lorry">according to the Guardian</a>.</p>
      <p>Separately, on Nov. 6, police stopped a truck on the highway 90 miles outside London and found <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2FInternational%2F15-men-found-alive-back-truck-suspected-entering%2Fstory%3Fid%3D66815780&amp;data=02%7C01%7CWilliam.M.Mansell%40disney.com%7C9ac5b3e922aa4e701c7608d76f77288a%7C56b731a8a2ac4c32bf6b616810e913c6%7C1%7C0%7C637100429874769187&amp;sdata=qgyR6dttDOu8mn%2FXuO86oQQO2g%2FWtbmg5SVBKZn13gE%3D&amp;reserved=0">15 men in the back</a>. On Nov. 19, <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2311161-25-verstekelingen-in-koelcontainer-op-veerboot-vlaardingen.html">Dutch media</a> reported that 25 stowaways had been discovered in a refrigerated container in a ferry on its way to the UK from the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>At the end of October, the U.K. government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-review-will-enhance-response-to-serious-and-organised-crime">announced</a> a new drive to crack down on serious organized crime, including trafficking.</p>
