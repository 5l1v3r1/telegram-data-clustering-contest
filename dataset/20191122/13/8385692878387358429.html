      <p>Amazon has a <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">great discount</a> on a yearly subscription to PlayStation Plus right now. Allowing you to save $15. It's now just $44.99. It's not often that we see it drop this low, so now's a good time to re-up your subscription.</p>
      <p>If you already have PlayStation Plus and it doesn't expire for a bit, don't worry. You can still grab another year and add it to your account right now. You can add up to 10 years of PlayStation Plus subscriptions to your account. This way you are paying for it when its on sale and cheap, rather than paying for the full 12 months.</p>
      <p>Now if you have someone on your list this year that is a big gamer, and games on PlayStation, this is going to be a great gift to pick up.</p>

      <p>With PlayStation Plus, you are able to play online against your friends and other people. You also get discounted games, and media that you can consume.</p>
      <p>However, the best part of PlayStation Plus is the fact that you get free games every single month. Now these aren't big games that were just released and are now $60. These are usually India games or slightly older games (like last month, MLB 19 The Show was free, and MLB 20 The Show came out back in April, so it was quite old at this point). But it's still free.</p>
      <p>PlayStation Plus is definitely worth the $60 per year that you would normally pay. Heck, that's just $5, you pay more for Netflix every month. But now that it's $44.99, that makes it an even better deal, coming in at just $3.75 per month.</p>
