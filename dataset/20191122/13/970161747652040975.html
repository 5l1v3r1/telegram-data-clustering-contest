      <h1>Pokémon Center store to reopen in London – but it’s still not permanent</h1>
      <address>

      <p>A new pop-up Pokémon Center will be coming to London next summer as part of the 2020 Pokémon World Championships.</p>
      <p>It seems the success of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/18/pokemon-center-london-store-open-now-10940567/">Pokémon Center London</a> has not gone unnoticed and there are already plans to set up a new store on the same site during the 2020 Pokémon World Championships.</p>
      <p>The Championships, which cover both the video games and the trading cards, don’t have a specific date or venue yet but they’re expected to be sometime around August.</p>
      <p>There’s no more information than that, so it’s unclear whether the store will have the same stock or new items, considering the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/london-city-pikachu-plush-will-sold-forever-sunday-london-pokemon-center-11038472/">London City Pikachu plush sold out</a> several days before the first store closed.</p>

      <p>The original store shut the day of the release of Pokémon Sword and Shield, which always seemed a bit weird, and featured surprisingly little merchandise based on the new games, but presumably more will be available by next year.</p>

      <p>According to The Pokémon Company more than 30,000 people visited the original store during its four weeks of existence, with fans <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/25/pokemon-center-london-cuts-opening-hours-limits-purchases-10985495/">camping out overnight</a> just to get in and opening hours having to be cut when stock ran out.</p>
      <p>The news of the reopening comes just days after a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/get-load-exclusive-merch-new-nintendo-tokyo-store-11183658/">new Nintendo Store</a> – only the second in the world – was announced in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Fans immediately began wondering whether Nintendo would open something similar in the UK, whether for Nintendo in general or just Pokémon. Either way it’d make a lot more sense than that stupid M&amp;M’s World in Leicester Square.</p>
