      <p>Two Bangladesh batsmen, Liton Das and Nayeem Hasan, were retired hurt from the Day/Night Test against India on Friday, forcing the visitors to bring in as concussion substitutes players who had been dropped from the team.</p>
      <p>Some Indian commentators, including Sunil Gavaskar and Murali Kartik, said on air that teams are misusing the substitution provision these days.</p>
      <p>Both Das and Nayeem were hit by <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mohammed-shami/">Mohammed Shami</a> snorters and were replaced by Mehidy Hasan and Taijul Islam at the Eden Gardens.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh wicketkeeper-batsman Das was taken to a city hospital for a scan before another Shami delivery hit Nayeem, who was interestingly attended to by Indian team physio Nitin Patel.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh, thus, became the first team to make two concussion substitutes in a Test match.</p>
      <p>Mehidy came in as concussion substitute after Das was hit. However, Mehidy, an off-spinner, will not be allowed to bowl as per the concussion substitute rule.</p>
      <p>The physio rushed in, conducted a test and he continued batting, responding with a boundary in the next delivery. Das hit another boundary in the next over off Ishant and added nine runs before complaining of discomfort. He was next seen walking off the field after a long conversation with the umpire, forcing the end of the first session with the score reading 73 for six.</p>
      <p>Das’ like-for-like substitute Saif Hassan is down with a (split webbing) injury, forcing the visitors to opt for Mehidy as concussion substitute.</p>
      <p>Taijul Islam came on as a substitute fielder for Nayeem, who was also hit on the helmet by a Shami bouncer. He is allowed to bowl as he replaced an outfield fielder.</p>
      <p>According to the protocol, a proper medical report has to be submitted to the match referee for a concussion substitute.</p>
