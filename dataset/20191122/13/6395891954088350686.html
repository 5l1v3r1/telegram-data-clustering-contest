      <p><b>NEWPORT, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - A Rhode Island dentist has pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting a young boy over a period of years.</p>
      <p>Maria Asciolla was released on $50,000 bail after her arraignment Thursday on four counts of first-degree child molestation.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say the 57-year-old Asciolla engaged in sexual acts with a male victim under the age of 14 on various dates between Nov. 24, 2016 and Sept. 29, 2018.</p>
      <p>Asciolla lived in Jamestown and had a dental practice in East Greenwich. According to broadcast reports, her name is no longer on the dental office's sign and she is no longer practicing.</p>
      <p>Her attorney did not comment on the specifics of the case but objected to some of the conditions of her release, including a no-contact order with the alleged victim.</p>
