      <h2>Even as it enters its dotage the Skoda Octavia still sells well – buyers drawn in by its value, comfort and enormous interior space.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:54:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/jackmckeown/" target="_blank">Jack McKeown</a></address>
      <p>So the fourth generation model, which Skoda unveiled this week, is expected to be a huge success story for the Volkswagen-owned Czech firm.</p>
      <p>The latest version offers a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) version for the first time, plus mild hybrid, diesel and petrol versions.</p>
      <p>It also manages to wring even more practicality out of what is already the most spacious car in its class, increasing boot size by 10 litres to an even 600.</p>
      <p>Skoda has tried hard to make the new Octavia feel more upmarket than the last car, with soft-touch plastics, padded trim finishes and thickly stuffed seats for extra comfort. Pay more and you can have them heated, cooled and with a massage function, too.</p>
      <p>There are plenty of clever touches including netted storage in the boot, pockets on the side of the front seats to hold your smartphone and an umbrella integrated into the front door.</p>
      <p>The car is available with a choice of three petrol engines. Both the 110hp 1.0-litre petrol three-cylinder and the 150hp 1.5-litre four-cylinder petrols come with a six-speed manual gearbox with the option to upgrade to a seven-speed automatic.</p>
      <p>Choose the auto and you’ll also get a 48V mild-hybrid system which allows the car to coast on the motorway to save fuel.</p>
      <p>There are also three diesel engines, all 2.0 litre in displacement and all capable of returning 60mpg.</p>
      <p>The plug-in hybrid, meanwhile, couples a 1.4 litre petrol engine with a battery and electric motor. They produce a combined 204bhp and the PHEV can do around 35 miles on electric power alone.</p>
      <p>The fourth generation Skoda Octavia goes on sale in the middle of next year, with a starting price of around £19,000, which will go up to £30,000 for a top spec diesel estate.</p>
