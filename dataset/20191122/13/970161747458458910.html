      <h1>Meghan Markle's best royal outfits</h1>

      <p>Let’s face it, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/meghan-markle/">Meghan Markle</a> has always had a great sense of style.</p>
      <p>That being said, she stepped up her game when she started dating <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-harry/">Prince Harry</a> – and since becoming the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan has become as much of a royal fashion icon as her husband’s late mother, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/diana/">Princess Diana</a>.</p>
      <p>It then comes as no surprise that she has nabbed the top spot in the ranking for most influential celebrity dresser in the annual Lyst ‘Year in Fashion’ report for 2019.</p>
      <p>We hear you, Lyst and we agree.</p>
      <p>To celebrate the Duchess’ fabulous fashion choices, here are some of her best looks since she became a part of the royal family.</p>
      <h3>The wedding reception outfit</h3>

      <p>On her special day in May 2018, Meghan wore a silk gown designed by British fashion designer Claire Waight Keller, the artistic director at Givenchy.</p>

      <p>However, while it was admittedly a beautiful wedding dress, the real stunner of the day was this bespoke high-neck gown by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/stella-mccartney/">Stella McCartney</a> made from silk crepe.</p>
      <p>It screamed old school glamour, and Meghan looked fantastic in it.</p>
      <h3>The Cape Town outfit</h3>

      <p>On their tour of Cape Town, Meghan sported laid-back looks.</p>
      <p>One of our favourites is this flowing sky blue dress by Veronica Beard, paired with the same Castañer espadrilles that she wore during her Royal Tour in Australia.</p>
      <p>We love a recycled royal shoe.</p>
      <h3>The other Cape Town outfit</h3>

      <p>The Veronica Beard dress wasn’t the only stunning fashion choice that the Duchess made during her Cape Town visit.</p>
      <p>For her meeting with female entrepreneurs in technology, she rocked a long black jumpsuit from Everlane.</p>
      <p>She added some glitz by pairing it with round gold earrings from GAS Bijoux.</p>
      <h3>The big baby moment outfit</h3>

      <p>On 8 May, the British public finally got to meet Meghan and Harry’s son – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/archie-harrison/">Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor</a>.</p>
      <p>He was undoubtedly captivating, but so was his mother in her sleeveless trench dress by Grace Wales Bonner.</p>
      <p>But with that new-mum glow, she could have been wearing an old t-shirt and jeans, and she would still have looked fantastic.</p>
      <h3>The Wimbledon outfit</h3>

      <p>Meghan isn’t just an expert on how to dress up, she’s also great at dressing down.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>When she attended a Wimbledon tennis match, the Duchess wore jeans with a black shirt and a striped blazer.</p>
      <p>Her Panama-style hat from Madewell x Biltmore was the big hit though – and it was super affordable, too (that is, until it sold out straight after Meg wore it).</p>
      <h3>The laid-back outfit</h3>

      <p>If you thought Meghan hasn’t adjusted to the rainy British weather, you’d be wrong.</p>
      <p>Once again proving that she’s the queen of chic casual wear, she donned a black ankle-length pantsuit from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/alexander-mcqueen/">Alexander McQueen</a> for the Endeavour Fund Awards’ Ceremony in 2018.</p>
      <p>And she paired it with pointed stilettos, her signature shoe style.</p>

      <p>We don’t often see the Duchess in print, but she treated us to this gem on International Women’s Day.</p>
      <p>The 70s style mini dress is Azzura by the high street brand, Reiss, and the black blazer if by Alexander McQueen.</p>
      <p>As for her accessories, Meghan went with Manolo Blahnik pumps and earrings from Jessica McCormack.</p>
      <h3>The Morocco trip outfit</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1132499550.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C839&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>In February, Meghan and Harry paid a visit to King Mohammed VI of Morocco (Picture: Pool/Samir Hussein/WireImage)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>On the third day of the royal couple’s trip to Morocco, where they visited King Mohammed VI, the Duchess wore this incredible Carolina Herrera gown.</p>
      <p>If you fancy picking up the blue, patterned dress for yourself, it’ll cost you £3,222.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Or maybe just get something similar from a high street shop, and spend the rest of the money on a holiday in Morocco.</p>
      <h3>The nod to Suits outfit</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1044998692.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C810&amp;ssl=1"/>

      </figure>
      <p>When she stepped out at the Chichester Enginering and Digital Technology Park in Bognor Regis, we got throwback feels to Meghan’s actor days.</p>
      <p>Her moss green leather pencil skirt from Hugo Boss looked very much like something that her character on Suits, Rachel, would buy.</p>
      <p>She paired it with a matching green shirt from &amp; Other Stories (the chain owned by H&amp;M) and a nude Armani coat.</p>
      <h3>The Commonwealth Youth Challenge outfit</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-992359340.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C819&amp;ssl=1"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Meghan wore this Brandon Maxwell dress for the Commonwealth Youth Challenge last year.</p>
      <p>It was an unusual choice for the Duchess, who doesn’t usually favour strong colours but this pop of yellow suited her perfectly.</p>
      <p>And the understated nude pumps just made the outfit that much better.</p>
      <h3>The Edinburgh visit outfit</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-917843176.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C1010&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>For her trip to Scotland, she went with tartan (Picture: Samir Hussein/WireImage)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>During a visit to Edinburgh in 2018, Meghan wore a gorgeous double-faced tartan coat from Burberry – an excellent choice for a trip to Scotland.</p>
      <p>She’s not the only royal to favour this design.</p>
      <p>Her sister-in-law, Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, wore a tartan dress by Alexander McQueen when she visited Dundee with Prince William.</p>

      <h3>The engagement announcement outfit</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Last but not least, it’s the outfit that will forever be remembered as the look of a new royal being born.</p>
      <p>For her engagement day, Meghan chose a white belted coat by the Canadian brand Line The Label.</p>
      <p>Let’s face it though, we were all too busy looking at the ring on her finger to really notice the outfit – the sapphire diamond that once belonged to the late Princess of Wales, Diana.</p>
