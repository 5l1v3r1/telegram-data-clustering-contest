      <h1>Mourinho: Every Manager Wants To Play Young Players If The Potential Is There</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:28:45+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:28</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Redmond</a></address>

        <b>Jose Mourinho has said that he will give young players a chance at Tottenham Hotspur if he feels they are good enough.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Spurs announced Mourinho as Mauricio Pochettino’s replacement on Wednesday morning following the surprise sacking of the Argentine. On paper, it doesn’t look like a natural fit between the former Manchester United manager and Spurs.</p>
      <p>The north London club have been prudent in the transfer market and with player contracts, keeping a lid on spending as they funded the redeveloped White Hart Lane. Spurs’ reluctance to renew their squad appears to have been the final straw for Pochettino and what sparked his exit after months of frustration.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mourinho has often waged war with his board if he has not felt their support in the transfer market.</p>

      <p>The Portuguese coach also doesn’t have a strong track record of promoting young players, preferring experienced stars – something bound to concern Irish football fans who have been keenly following <b>Troy Parrott’s</b> progress.</p>
      <p>However, upon being appointed, <a href="https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2019/november/jose-mourinho-appointed-new-head-coach/">Mourinho</a> stated that he was “excited” by the “quality in both the squad and the academy”, which suggests he may have changed his stance on promoting youngsters.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1197832405626900481">BT Sports interview</a> ahead of his first match as Spurs coach, away to West Ham United on Saturday, Jose expanded on his comments. The former Real Madrid manager said his mention of the academy being part of his plans reflects the difference between Man United and Spurs, rather than any personal change he has experienced.</p>
      <p>Basically, he didn’t feel the young players at United were good enough, but that may change at Tottenham.</p>

      <p>“There are clubs that are better than others in creating conditions for the young players,” he said.</p>
      <blockquote>“I’ll give you an example, when I arrived at Manchester United, the Under-23 team, they were relegated. When a team is relegated, it is because the quality was not there. Where was the quality? In the younger ones.</blockquote>
      <p>“So, it was the younger ones that we started developing by bringing them to the first-team, by bringing them to pre-season, by playing them in pre-season matches in the US – even against top teams like Real Madrid, Liverpool, AC Milan. And this is the generation that has more potential than the other.</p>
      <blockquote>“But every manager wants to play young players, everyone wants. So, if the potential is there, you are very happy to help the young guys develop.”</blockquote>
      <p>Of course, actions will speak louder than words, but Mourinho’s comments suggest <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/oisinmcqueirns2758/bayern-munich-troy-parrott/">Parrott</a> may be given an opportunity. The 17-year-old Dubliner has been scoring regularly for Spurs’ Under-23 side and has already represented Ireland at senior level. He is regarded as one of the brightest prospects in British football.</p>

      <p>However, even if Parrott doesn’t get a chance under Mourinho, he still has a long way to go in his career and his time with the first-team will surely come eventually.</p>
