        <b>Thomas Tuchel has had to cope without Kylian Mbappe and Neymar for chunks of the season but both men are in the squad to take on Lille.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Neymar and Kylian Mbappe are back in the Paris Saint-Germain squad to face Lille in Ligue 1 on Friday.</p>
      <p>Both of Thomas Tuchel’s star forwards have endured injury interrupted campaigns so far.</p>
      <p>Neymar missed the start of the season as he completed his rehabilitation from ankle ligament damage but returned in style with four goals in five Ligue 1 outings.</p>
      <p>A hamstring injury sustained while on duty with Brazil last month left him back on the sidelines but Tuchel told reporters on Thursday the world’s most expensive footballer had resumed training.</p>
      <p>Mbappe has nine goals in 11 games across all competitions in 2019-20 despite being compromised by hamstring, thigh and adductor problems, before illness placed his participation in the game at the Parc des Princes in doubt.</p>
      <p>The attacking duo return in time for a pivotal week, with trips to Real Madrid and Monaco on the horizon.</p>

      <p>PSG are eight points clear of Marseille at the top of Ligue 1 table and they are five points better off than Madrid thanks to a perfect record from four Champions League group matches to date.</p>
      <p>Right-back Thomas Meunier is back from a hamstring injury but midfielders Marco Verratti (knee) and Ander Herrera (thigh) remain among the absentees.</p>
