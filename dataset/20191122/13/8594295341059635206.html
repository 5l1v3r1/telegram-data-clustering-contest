      <blockquote>Hi Sajeev,<br/><br/>I don’t know if this is strictly within your purview or not, but here goes. I am a dual citizen (U.S. and Canada) currently living in Canada. I will be retiring and moving back to the U.S. within the next (hopefully) few months. My current car (Mercedes B250) is 5 years old, is a model that isn’t/wasn’t sold in the U.S., and has exclusively metric instrumentation, so I plan to sell it in Canada and buy new in the U.S.<br/><br/>The last time I bought a new car in the U.S. was in 1995, and I gather that the world has changed since then. In particular, I understand there are internet-based resources that available to vehicle buyers that help arm them for the “dealer engagement” process. From reading TTAC, I also understand that one pioneer in this area (TrueCar) has gone over to the Dark Side. So, I’m left to wonder what sources I should be consulting for information on how to avoid getting totally shafted.<br/><br/>I also see that companies and groups like Costco and AARP have vehicle buying programs for their members, and wonder how useful these programs actually are.<br/><br/>I’d appreciate your thoughts on the subject, and of course any that the B&amp;B have to offer.</blockquote>

      <p>I’ll give it a shot, but consume a big grain of salt since my full time job is in that “Dark Side” of the car business: <b><i>read the following knowing it’s only my personal opinion</i></b> and not those of any of my taskmasters.</p>
      <p>TrueCar and other Third Party <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sales-lead.asp">Lead</a> Sources (TPLS) make life easier, just don’t expect the best price with their help. Overall <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/add-on-services-emerge-as-car-dealers-profit-generator-11554634800">new car margins</a> aren’t what they used to be in 1995, so “getting totally shafted” is somewhat tough <b>if</b> you understand <a href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/personal-finance-basics/">personal finance basics</a> with modest market research from almost any resource on the Internet. <i>More on the second part later.</i></p>
      <p>After hundreds of conversations (and countless online nuggets of customer feedback), I understand everyone’s application of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp">time value of money</a> is different: some are thrilled to push a few buttons and get a lower-than-MSRP price from a friendly voice/email, while others must get in the weeds for the biggest discounts.</p>
      <p>But hey, <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2017/07/buying-truecar-really-helped-pay-truck/">don’t take my word</a> for it.</p>
      <p>That said, dealers must be all things to all online shoppers: TPLS’ are great, and they are one reason why larger dealer groups are getting into the online buying game (<a href="https://autonationdrive.com/autonation-express/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.penskecars.com/preferred-purchase.aspx">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.group1auto.com/acceleride/">here</a> for reference). A TPLS vs. Native Dealer Website dichotomy could percolate to most automotive retailers nationwide: a future Piston Slap where yours truly pontificates the merits of TPLS vs. A Future Foretold by <a href="https://www.carvana.com/how-it-works">Carvana</a> isn’t as stupid as it sounds. (Probably.)</p>
      <p>Here’s the deal: less effort equals more cost for a new car. (Used cars are a far tougher nut to crack.) And let’s not forget Google is a TPLS worth your consideration, as I just used it for the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/getting-good-car-deal/">How to negotiate</a> with dealerships.</li>
        <li>The latest customer incentives, either at the manufacturer or on <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-incentives/">3PL sites</a>.</li>
        <li>Find your <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+my+credit+score">credit score</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ACYBGNR-5gJK2gBPrWy7y7k6VA0lM2jE8g%3A1574127839931&amp;ei=30jTXd-zOISuswXntZso&amp;q=car+loan+rates&amp;oq=car+loan+rates&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l5j0i20i263j0l4.9801.11476..11814...0.2..0.62.392.7......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j35i39j0i67.l1ZCIhDBaBE&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifn-uVk_XlAhUE16wKHefaBgUQ4dUDCAs&amp;uact=5">loan rates</a> from popular banks.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=toyota+dealer+me&amp;oq=toyota+dealer+me">Searching</a> on Google Maps for all applicable dealers in your area. (or within a 3-5 city area, depending on how serious you wanna get!)</li>
        <li>Contacting Internet sales departments within each store in #4.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Not all Internet sales departments are created equal, not all dealer inventories are the same, so the prices <s>can</s> will vary. But I reckon a few hours doing your homework on Google and crafting a templated letter to each Internet Sales Department might be worth your while. Or maybe a bit more time reading each dealer’s reviews and finding a salesperson you’d want to work with, then email them directly!</p>
      <p>But if that’s a waste of your time, I know plenty of people who love TPLS and nobody’s gonna argue with their happiness.</p>
      <p>Bring it home for us, Best and Brightest!</p>
