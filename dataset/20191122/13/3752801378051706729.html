      <h1>Toilet tender: 10 accused in Amathole municipality corruption case get bail</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:45:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:45</time> by <a rel="author">Azarrah Karrim</a></address>
      <p>Nine people arrested in connection with a tender awarded for the accelerated sanitation programme dubbed "Siyenza" have each been granted R40 000 bail.</p>
      <p>The second accused in the case was granted R10 000 bail. </p>
      <p>The 10 accused appeared in the East London Magistrate’s Court on Friday on charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/hawks-arrest-top-cogta-ceo-20191121">News24</a> confirmed on Thursday that CEO of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs’ (Cogta) Municipal Infrastructure Support Agent (MISA), Goodman Ntandazo Vimba, was among the group. </p>
      <p>According to National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Luxolo Tyali,  the "condition [around bail] is that they must hand over their travelling documents and request approval from the investigating officer if they intend to leave the country".</p>
      <p>The group will return to court on February 5, 2020.</p>
      <p>The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (the Hawks) arrested the 10 on Thursday, in a sweeping crackdown across the country, in the Eastern Cape, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal.</p>
      <p>In a statement following the arrests, Hawks spokesperson Colonel Katlego Mogale said: "The operation follows a complaint by the National Treasury after it transpired that the suspects allegedly colluded in accessing the Amathole District Municipality funds through the flaunting of procurement processes. Afterwards, they were awarded a contract for ventilated, improved toilets in the Eastern Cape.</p>
      <p>"The Hawks' preliminary investigation discovered that over R600m was to be awarded for the contract, of which R286m [was already] paid to the suspects."</p>
