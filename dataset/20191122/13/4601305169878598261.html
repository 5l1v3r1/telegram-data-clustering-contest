      <h1>Tesla just announced a... DeLorean Monster Truck?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:23:38+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/rob_beschizza" target="_blank">Rob Beschizza</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://jalopnik.com/tesla-cybertruck-this-is-it-1839984174">Tesla truck is here</a>. Its stainless steel hide can withstand sledgehammer blows, but its windows are not quite so impervious to enemy action. It's not clear how long it takes to go from 0-88 MPH, but I'm certain we'll find out. Jalopnik:</p>
      <blockquote>Tesla chose to unveil this here and now because Musk loves Blade Runner. And to date, he’s made some wild claims about what it can do: out-truck a Ford F-150, outperform a Porsche 911, be “literally bulletproof” and ideally start under $50,000. It’s also “the official truck of Mars.”<br/><br/>The man’s a lot of things, but modest isn’t one of them. ...<br/><br/>a 14,000-pound tow claim, a 3,500-pound payload claim, three ranges (200 miles, 300 miles and 500 miles), adaptive air suspension and a base price of $39,900 for the rear-wheel drive single-motor version. The max range version, with all-wheel drive and three electric motors, is said to be $69,900.<br/><br/>Production is said to be coming in late 2021, and the tri-motor version is happening in 2022, Musk said.</blockquote>
      <p>This is absolutely a survivalist fantasy vehicle. Magical.</p>
