      <h1>Joe Swash feared he'd sexually harassed Stacey Solomon with awkward first kiss</h1>
      <h2>Joe Swash admitted he'd lunged at Stacey Solomon during her time in Australia - and worried his boss would punish him for harassing her</h2>

      <p>Joe Swash was so worried about the way he first kissed Stacey Solomon that he thought he might get fired.</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders star made an ill-advised lunge at his now-girlfriend while they were both out in Australia for the 2015 series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, where Joe was presenting the spin-off show.</p>
      <p>And while the pair had known each other for a few years, Joe wasn't sure his flirting attempts were going down well with her.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Kate Thornton on the Yahoo podcast White Wine Question Time, Joe confessed how badly he'd misjudged their first kiss.</p>

      <p>"Stacey was only there (in Australia) for four days. So I was thinking: 'I've got four days. I've only got four days'. And we got to the last day, nothing, she hadn't given me the scent or anything…" he recalled.</p>
      <p>"I thought, 'Right!' It was her last night in the apartment before she went, so I thought I'd knock on the door and I thought, 'I've seen it on films before, I'm just going to go in and kiss her'. It weren't like that, it were nothing like that."</p>
      <p>Stacey, laughing, said: "It was nothing like in the films, Kate. I almost felt like I was being attacked. He said bye, and I said bye, then I shut the door and he knocked again, so I opened the door and he literally went…" [Mimes sudden head movement forward.]"</p>

      <p>Joe went on: "So basically I was just kissing teeth, as I was doing this I was just thinking, 'I've really misread this situation'.</p>
      <p>"Then she went home and I got a text from her. I can't remember what the text said, but I think it was like: 'Sorry I didn't kiss you back. It was really nice.'</p>
      <p>"I was expecting a call from my boss saying, 'Have you been sexually harassing Stacey Solomon?' And I thought, 'Aw, I've got a problem here, Joe.'"</p>
      <p>Once they'd established Stacey was happy to be kissed, the pair's friendship quickly flourished into romance - after she'd spelled out exactly what she wanted.</p>

      <p>"I didn't want to be too available!" Stacey went on.</p>
      <p>"When you've got kids, you feel the need to set it out so like, I have two kids, a cat, a dog and a really big mortgage, do you still want to go out with me.</p>
      <p>"You've got to be upfront. 'Here's my Ts&amp;Cs - let me know if you fancy it'."</p>
      <p>The couple moved in together last year, bringing their blended family - Joe's 12-year-old son and Stacey's boys Leighton and Zachary - under one roof.</p>
      <p>And they welcomed their baby son Rex into the world earlier this summer.</p>
      <p>Cheeky Joe even asked for a puff of Stacey's gas and air while she was busy pushing.</p>
      <p>"Every time I got it she growled, 'don't you put your germs on there'," he said sheepishly.</p>
