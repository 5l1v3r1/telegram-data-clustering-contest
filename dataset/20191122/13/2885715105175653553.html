      <p>A policeman in Tripura was killed after he was allegedly hit by three speeding vehicles late on Thursday night. Two vehicles have been seized by the police so far, Director General of Tripura Police Akhil Kumar Shukla said.</p>
      <p>The incident took place along the Sonamura-Kamalnagar road when Sub-Inspector Durga Kumar Hrangkhawl tried to spot three private vehicles travelling at high speed close to midnight. The cop sustained grievous wounds after he was hit by the vehicles who then fled the spot.</p>
      <p>The sub-inspector was rushed to Boxanagar Primary Health Centre (PHC), and was later referred to Tripura Medical College and further to state-run Govind Ballabh Pant (GBP) Hospital where he succumbed to injuries this morning.</p>
      <p>The deceased cop was honoured with a gun salute and floral tributes at Arundhatinagar Police Grounds this afternoon. Law Minister Ratan Lal Nath said the state government has announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the victim’s family.</p>
      <p>“This is very painful. Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb and Deputy Chief Minister Jishnu Devvarma is out of town now. I have come here on behalf of the state government. This officer was a very honest officer. I am deeply saddened by his demise,” Nath said. The minister cried foul play into the incident and said the vehicles deliberately hit the cop.</p>
      <p>DGP Shukla said, “It is not an accidental death. It is a case of murder. These vehicles were not involved in simple actions. All options are open, including the possibility of smuggling. A probe is underway. No one has been arrested yet. But we shall take all the necessary steps.”</p>
      <p>The deceased police officer is survived by his son, daughter and wife.</p>
