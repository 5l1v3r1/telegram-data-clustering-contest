        <b>Kirill Tereshin, known as Russian 'Popoye', who recently underwent surgery is recovering well after the procedure.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 23-year-old MMA fighter known for his huge biceps was said to have taken out about six liters of Vaseline during operation.</p>
      <p>Pictures of the MMA fighter went viral across most social media around the world after injecting the substance into his veins as reported by Sport Bible.</p>
      <p>Afterward, his biceps became too big that people likened him to one of the old popular cartoon characters 'Popoye'.</p>

      <p>The effect of the Vaseline caused his arms to deteriorate and eventually got paralyzed. It was then he decided to listen to the doctors.</p>

      <p>Tereshin released a video on his social media page about the surgery after the volume of vaseline had been taken out of his hands.</p>
      <p>He even jokingly put that he might sell some of the chunks from his body; "<i>These are my treasures...Get yourself a piece, it's 'sale' time</i>."</p>
