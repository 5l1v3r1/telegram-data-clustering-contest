      <h1>What Tone Vays Hates Most About Ripple’s XRP Token</h1>

        <b>If you’ve been following veteran cryptocurrency trader and analyst, <a href="http://ToneVays.com/">Tone Vays</a>, on <a href="https://twitter.com/ToneVays">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://youtube.com/tonevays">Youtube</a> for the past six months, it’s possible that you might have noticed a hint of negative sentiment from him towards XRP and Ripple. In an exclusive interview with <i>Bitcoinist, </i>we tried to get to the bottom of what he dislikes the most about the project.</b>

      <p>The battle against the ‘XRP army of the brain dead’ begins. Take it away, Tone…</p>

      <h3>1. XRP is just a security masquerading as a cryptocurrency</h3>
      <blockquote>$XRP is a token created &amp; controlled by Ripple Labs (aka Ripple the Corporation). They have tried to dissociate from $XRP but smart people know better. I believe $XRP has always been an unlicensed/unregistered/uncompliant security of Ripple Labs.</blockquote>
      <p>A devastating first blow. To be fair, it is hard to swallow Ripple’s protestations that it has no control over XRP, when it regularly <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-unlocks-1-billion-xrp-ahead-of-swell-conference/">dumps a billion more of them</a> on the market. The ongoing lawsuit is expected to continue on December 4th, when Ripple will have to respond to the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/433524568/XRP-Plaintiff-Response-to-Ripple-s-Motion-to-Dismiss#from_embed">new filing</a> put forward by the claimant that argues the monthly escrow release of XRP makes it an ongoing securities sale.</p>
      <h3>2. XRP has no real utility</h3>
      <blockquote>The utility of $XRP is completely fictional. There is absolutely no need to have a volatile currency and/or security in the middle of sending data within the company or even sending data between two companies. In addition this volatility is created by speculation &amp; trading on non-compliant exchanges.</blockquote>
      <p>Vays most recently questioned the utility of XRP when Ripple announced a partnership with BitPay to enable XRP for payments. Was it positioning itself as a Libra competitor, or trying to take over as a global reserve currency?</p>

      <h3>3. XRP is not Decentralized</h3>
      <blockquote>The claim that anything related to Ripple Labs or the $XRP token technology &amp; its nodes being decentralized is totally laughable. If $XRP is discovered to be used in illicit markets it would be shut down over night with a phone call from US Authorities to the Ripple CEO.</blockquote>
      <p>Back in May, Vays <a href="https://twitter.com/tonevays/status/1132682944139735040">tweeted</a> that XRP is ‘NOT decentralized or trustless’ and ‘NOT even a Blockchain’. Some argued that the XRP ledger would continue to exist if Ripple was shut down, hence it was decentralized, but in a later post Vays quashed this idea also.</p>
      <p>He highlighted that when Iran turned to Bitcoin last year to avoid US sanctions, as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/iran-first-country-forced-use-bitcoin/">reported</a> by <i>Bitcoinist, </i>there was nothing any Government was able to do about it. Vays argued that had it been XRP that Iran used instead of Bitcoin, Ripple would’ve been coerced by Government officials to use of XRP. This, he says, is what defines the difference between Bitcoin, and centralized shitcoins.</p>

      <h3>4. Ripple’s Business Plan is Dishonest</h3>
      <blockquote>The only reason for $XRP to exist is for a few people to get super rich and have competitive advantage over their more honest competition that chose not to print their own money, or create unregistered securities providing the same service. With this money, they are able to buy influence with government officials, hire former SEC heads as their lawyers, promote with former US Presidents, and buy into failing companies like MoneyGram to pump $XRP.</blockquote>
      <p>A tweet back in August set out Vays’ understanding of Ripple’s business plan. Certainly the MoneyGram tie-up <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-spikes-10-on-ripple-moneygram-partnership-news/">pumped XRP a good 15%</a> back in June, so arguably the plan has worked in the past. More recently, XRP price has been having a somewhat worse time of it though, even <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-down-16-since-swell-can-price-recover/">after its highly anticipated Swell</a> conference.</p>

      <p>This is by no means the first time Tone Vays has spoken out about his concerns regarding Ripple and its native currency, XRP. Back in 2017, Vays spoke with Bitcoin developer, Peter Todd, on an episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQKxSVLLfAk&amp;list=PLQBwZ2xry6ebYoZktlQeeKDGeJaMP5EJ1&amp;index=8">Cryptoscam podcast</a> about Ripple’s suspect founder, Jed Mcaleb, and the project’s questionable value proposition. In the end, it was concluded that, “the Ripple system doesn’t have a clear need for XRP”.</p>
      <h3>The Smoke Clears</h3>
      <p>Aside from labelling the XRP army as ‘brain dead’, Vays has moved into the event organising game. Last month saw his <a href="http://thefinancialsummit.com/">Financial Summit</a> event launch in Bali, and back in April he hosted the <a href="http://UnderstandingBTC.com/">Understanding Bitcoin</a> conference in Malta.</p>
      <p>Perhaps most exciting, is the upcoming <a href="https://twitter.com/Unconfiscatable">Unconfiscatable</a> event next February in Vegas. A Bitcoin conference, poker tournament and unashamedly carnivore dinner rolled up in one. Vays certainly knows what makes Bitcoiners tick.</p>
