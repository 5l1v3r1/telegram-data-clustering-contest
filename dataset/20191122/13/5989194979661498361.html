        <b>Nya Journalistpriset (The New Journalism Award) is handed out to journalists who write about Sweden and help promote constructive debate about integration in a language other than Swedish.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Local and its journalists Emma Löfgren and Catherine Edwards <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20191025/the-locals-journalists-nominated-for-swedish-foreign-language-media-award">were nominated in two categories for the award</a>, which was handed out by job-matching firm Lernia and Swedish news magazine Fokus on Thursday, but lost out in a tough field to Mahmoud Agha and KB Mosaik. </p>
      <p>Mahmoud Agha won the prize for best non-Swedish journalistic contribution in Sweden, "for his commitment and journalistic work on raising social issues, such as integration, for the Arabic-speaking parts of the population" as founder and editor-in-chief of <a href="https://alkompis.se/sv/">Al Kompis</a>, Sweden's largest independent newssite in Arabic.</p>
      <p>The prefix <i>Al </i>means 'the' in Arabic and <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20191118/swedish-word-of-the-day-kompis"><i>kompis </i>is the Swedish word for 'friend'</a>. Their audience is mainly Arabic-speakers in Sweden, but they also publish articles in Swedish, Farsi, Somali and Tigrinya. </p>
      <p>"We work a lot with social media and want to be close to our readers and followers. Like a friend," Agha said as he received the award on stage at the Wetterling Gallery in Stockholm.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.kristianstadsbladet.se/om/kb+mosaik/">KB Mosaik</a>, a monthly newspaper in Arabic, English and simple Swedish, took home the award for best medium or platform that discusses integration in a constructive way.</p>
      <p>It is published by regional newspaper Kristianstadsbladet and is handed out to, among others, libraries and Swedish for Immigrants schools in southern Swedish region Skåne.</p>
      <p>It was "nominated for having facilitated the integration of immigrants in Skåne through informative journalism on the web, in print and through gatherings".</p>
      <p>Congratulations to Mahmoud Agha and KB Mosaik from The Local, and a special thank you to our readers and Members, both those reading from home and those who came to celebrate with us last night.</p>
