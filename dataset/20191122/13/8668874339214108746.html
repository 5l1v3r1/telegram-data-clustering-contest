      <p>Saracens are set to ramp up their Heineken Champions Cup title defence after including <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/saracens-players-vetoing-the-six-nations-would-be-positive-for-england/">four of England’s World Cup final players</a> in their squad to face <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ospreys">Ospreys</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The defending champions were humbled 10-30 in the opening round last Sunday at Racing, but they have brought in some of their big names to get their campaign up and running at the second attempt.</p>
      <p>Three players who featured in the final in Yokohama against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> on November 2 are in the starting XV. They included the debut-making <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/wasps/players/elliot-daly/">Elliot Daly</a>, who slots in at full-back after making the summer switch from Wasps.</p>
      <p>Mako Vunipola lines up at loosehead, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/george-kruis/">George Kruis</a> is chosen at second row while hooker <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/jamie-george/">Jamie George</a> makes the bench for the Allianz Park clash which is Saracens’ 100th match in the Champions Cup.</p>
      <p>In total, Mark McCall has changed seven of his starting side following the defeat in Paris in a week where <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens">Saracens</a> decided not to appeal their 35-point deduction and £5.3million fine for breaching the Premiership salary cap.   </p>

      <p>Scrum-half <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/tom-whiteley/">Tom Whiteley</a> makes his maiden European start and winger <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/alex-lewington/">Alex Lewington</a> returns to the back three with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/rotimi-segun/">Rotimi Segun</a> switching to the right flank.</p>
      <p>There is a fresh look to the front row replacements as George, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/richard-barrington/">Richard Barrington</a> and Josh Ibuanokpe are selected following international duty, injury and suspension respectively while academy back row <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/wellington/players/andy-christie/">Andy Christie</a> could earn a debut run out in European club rugby’s blue-riband competition.</p>
