      <p>Steve Clarke's men learned their Nations League play-off fate this afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Dark Blues will take on Israel at Hampden in the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>If they come through that, then it will be a one-off away trip to either Norway or Serbia to battle it out for a spot at the major tournament.</p>
      <p>It would be a first in 21 years if Scotland were to make it, and Gerrard is happy to help out Steve Clarke.</p>

      <p>Speaking ahead of their clash with <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14917/hamilton/">Hamilton</a>, he said: "I certainly won't be standing in the way.</p>
      <p>"I represent this club in this country so for me I give it the support I need to give it. But we don't make those decisions. Ultimately it will be down to the SFA and stuff.</p>
      <p>"We'll go with the flow and if it means us skipping a game or adjusting a game we'll do everything we can to support (Scotland). That's what you've got to do."</p>
      <p>It comes after ex-<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14919/kilmarnock/">Kilmarnock</a> boss Clarke has urged Scottish football's governing bodies to do all that they can to ensure the national team is helped.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Stevie G admits he still has to "pinch himself" every time he thinks about how cheap Rangers bought Glen Kamara for.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old was initially snapped up on a pre-contract agreement last January from Dundee, along with Jordan Jones at Killie.</p>
      <p>However, unlike with Jones, the Light Blues opted to bring Kamara in early - signing him for a mere £50,000.</p>
      <p>Gerrard said: "We haven't heard of any interest down south, we've read tons about it though.</p>
      <p>"But I wouldn't be surprised if there was interest in Glen Kamara because he's been outstanding since he walked in the door.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes I still have to pinch myself for how we got him and what we got him for.</p>
      <p>"He got a real strong contract when he came here from Dundee.</p>
      <p>"The message for Glen and the other players is we always reward our players for consistent performances over a long period of time. Glen will be treated no different."</p>
