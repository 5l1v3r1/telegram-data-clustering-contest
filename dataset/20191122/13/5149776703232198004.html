      <h2>Landlords warn tenants that rents will rise as a result of the controversial scheme</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:17:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:17</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Jarram</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham City Council has doubled the amount landlords will have to pay to join a controversial licensing scheme.</p>
      <p>A decision to hike up the price for landlords was made on November 19 by the council's executive board.</p>
      <p>This has outraged landlords, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/landlords-warn-tenants-rents-soar-3547276">who believe the cost will have to fall onto their tenants</a>, with higher rent rises and concerns that more landlords will leave the city.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/politics">Nottingham City Council</a> launched selective licensing in August 2018 to crack down on bad landlords who leave properties in poor or unsafe conditions.</p>
      <p>Around 32,000 properties in the city need a licence to ensure their properties are meeting the criteria, with fines of up to £30,000 for those who fail to join the scheme.</p>
      <p>The council has received just over half.</p>
      <p>To obtain a licence, accredited landlords must pay £480 per property, while non-accredited pay £780.</p>
      <p>This will now rise to £670 (accredited) and £890 (non-accredited) in March 2020.</p>
      <p>Major concerns have been raised that good landlords are being penalised, and already meet the criteria set out by the council.</p>
      <p>Last week, Giles Inman, business development manager at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/property/">East Midlands Property Owners Group </a>based in Lenton, which represents around 600 landlords, said the hike is "another nail in the coffin."</p>
      <p>A Nottingham City Council spokeswoman said: "We are increasing fees for individual house licences.</p>
      <p>"The scheme is self-funding and the council has reviewed the licensing process and found it wasn’t recovering all of the costs, so fees have to increase to reflect that – but it remains the case that we are not allowed to make a profit from licence fees.</p>
      <p>"Over 18,000 landlords have already applied at the lower rate and we will work to engage with landlords who are not registered for the scheme - we would urge any of them to apply before the price rise at the end of March."</p>
