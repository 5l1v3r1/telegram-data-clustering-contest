      <h2>McCarthy was handed the draw he didn't want at the UEFA ceremony in Nyon this morning - two difficult away ties in the space of five days</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:00:50+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Chilled out Mick McCarthy insists Ireland will "fancy their chances" of winning an away Euro 2020 play-off if they succeed in beating Slovakia away in the semi-final.</p>
      <p>Republic boss McCarthy was handed the draw he didn't want at the UEFA ceremony in Nyon this morning - two difficult away ties in the space of five days at the end of March to qualify for the finals</p>
      <p>The 60-year-old claimed he wasn't worried about the path that lies ahead.</p>
      <p>But it means that if Ireland do prevail in Slovakia then they will face Northern Ireland or Bosnia-Herzegovina in the play-off decider. So a trip to Windsor Park in Belfast, or one of several venues in Bosnia - most likely Zenica.</p>
      <p>McCarthy quipped: “It’s par for the course isn’t it? It is, but I’m not worried about it.</p>
      <p>"If I start worrying about it now, what is the point?</p>
      <p>"We’ll hopefully have two games to play and, if we win the first in Slovakia, we’ll fancy our chances of going anywhere and getting a result." </p>

      <p>Inwardly, McCarthy won't be overly pleased with the outcome.</p>
      <p>But it also spells bad news for Ireland fans, who will have to scramble for limited tickets for the final in Belfast or Zenica if the Republic beat Slovakia.</p>
      <p>According to UEFA protocol, the home side must provide at least five percent of capacity to away fans.</p>
      <p>The FAI would receive just 1,100 tickets for a Belfast final - and 750 tickets for a decider in Zenica.</p>
      <p>Speaking earlier to FAI TV about facing Slovakia first up, McCarthy said: "It will be a difficult game, I have no doubt.</p>
      <p>"They were in Wales' group so I am sure I will be able to get info on them, though we can get it anyway from our analysts.</p>
      <p>"It's a tough game. People have said to me, 'You'll be playing one of the poorer sides, one of the third teams in the group' and I said, 'Yes, exactly like us, that's what we were', it's a level playing field except that they have the home tie."</p>
      <p>McCarthy admitted that home advantage is definitely a factor.</p>
      <p>"That has an impact on it, the venue, the crowd getting behind them, the fact that they feel happier at home and don't have to travel, that does has an impact and influence," he stated.</p>

      <p>"Whether it has such a big influence, we will see.</p>
      <p>"I'd like to take that performance (Denmark) into the game. We played well in that game, probably our best performance.</p>
      <p>"it was always going to be a tight game and I did anticipate that if it was 0-0 with 20 minutes to go we could have a go at it, a real go, as if you go at Denmark too early you get punished.</p>
      <p>"I get asked by the press about momentum, the disappointment of not winning, if that carries on. I don't think either carries on,.</p>
      <p>"We play on March 26th. The players might have another 20 games for their clubs before we meet up again."</p>
      <p>As for the carrot of making it to a Euro finals that includes matches taking place in the Aviva Stadium, McCarthy commented: "It's no more motivation that if we were playing in Timbuktu because I want to be in the Euro finals, I want to take the team there, the players want to get there.</p>
      <p>"There is more pressure, on me and the staff, that we have these games in Dublin, that keeps the pressure on.</p>
      <p>"But nothing extra would make me want to win a game of football, though.</p>
      <p>"That’s for me personally. But for the nation, for Ireland, it does mean a lot more, of course".</p>
