      <h1>US Pres. Trump: We have a deal with China, “potentially very close”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:53:52+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/eren-%C5%9Fengezer" target="_blank">Eren Sengezer</a></address>
      <p>During an interview with Fox News on Friday, US President said that they have a deal with China. "Potentially very close," Trump added while noting "this can't be an even deal," he told his Chinese counterpart Xi.</p>
      <p>These comments provided a modest boost to the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">market sentiment</a>, helping the US stocks futures turn positive on the day and the 10-year US Treasury pull away from daily lows. As of writing, the 10-year T-bond yield was still down 1.1% on the day.</p>
      <p>"We have to stand with Hong Kong but I'm also standing with President Xi," Trump told Fox News.</p>
