        <b>A Vietnamese businessman has been revealed as the owner of the world's most valuable whisky collection.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mr Viet Nguyen Dinh Tuan's collection was estimated to have an auction hammer price of nearly £10.8m by valuation experts at Rare Whisky 101 (RW101).</p>
      <p>The Ho Chi Minh City resident's collection comprises 535 of the world's rarest, oldest and finest bottles of Scotch and Japanese whisky.</p>
      <p>The record <a href="https://guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/546487-most-valuable-whisky-whiskey-collection">was confirmed by Guinness World Records</a>.</p>

      <p>The collection includes one of the world's only complete Macallan Fine and Rare collections, including the iconic 1926 "Fine and Rare".</p>
      <p>Only 40 bottles of the Macallan 1926 were ever released. Mr Viet owns three.</p>
      <p>A bottle of The Macallan 1926 <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-50170555">sold recently for nearly £1.5m</a>, including buyer's premium.</p>
      <p>Mr Viet's collection includes one of only 12 bottles of the oldest Bowmore ever released. A similar bottle fetched £300,000 at auction recently.</p>
      <p>He also owns one of only 24 bottles of the 1919 vintage Springbank.</p>

      <p>Mr Viet has been collecting rare and vintage bottles of whisky for more than 20 years.</p>
      <p>Having amassed more than 500 bottles, which are locked securely in a bespoke whisky lounge at his home, Mr Viet said he would continue to build on his collection.</p>
      <p>He said: "For me, whisky collecting has been my life's passion. Every spare I moment I get, I'm searching auction sites and trading websites to find famous and rare whiskies from around the world.</p>
      <p>"As for my collection, I have no intention of selling any of it. Not one bottle. In fact, I'll continue to hunt for more old and rare bottles and add to and enrich it."</p>

      <p>RW101 arrived at the collection's valuation by determining what it could realistically be expected to fetch if sold at auction in the UK in the current market.</p>
      <p>The valuation was subsequently submitted to Guinness World Records, who confirmed the feat by certification.</p>
      <p>RW101 co-founder Andy Simpson said: "We were somewhat gobsmacked, not to mention a little envious, when we realised the breadth and depth of Mr Viet's collection.</p>
      <p>"It's a truly stunning example of one person's 20-year passion and desire to seek out the finest, rarest bottles of whisky in the world."</p>
