        <b>Bahlul Mustafazade, the Azerbaijan international defender linked with Celtic and Sunderland over the past 12 months, has again reiterated his desire to play overseas.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 22-year-old, who was <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/celtic/scottish-football-live-celtic-target-tipped-to-become-star-hibs-duo-sign-deals-griffiths-brother-slams-rangers-fans-tierney-s-season-over-centre-back-eyes-ibrox-berth-1-4912608">first linked with the Hoops back in April</a> after impressing for Gabala, was expected to come to Scotland for a trial period, which never materialised.</p>
      <p>Instead, he moved to Gabala's rivals Sabah in June 2019, signing a three-year deal.</p>
      <p>Mustafazade made his international debut in September, and earlier this month was linked with Sunderland.</p>
      <p>The defender was asked about Sunderland's interest in the wake of Azerbaijan's 2-0 defeat to Wales in Euro 2020 qualifying.</p>
      <p>Post-match, he was <a href="https://www.azerisport.com/football/20191117110008997.html">asked</a>: "In the last gew international matches you have performed well. Would you like to move to a foreign league?"</p>
      <p>He replied: "Of course. I really want to [play abroad].</p>
      <p>"Recently, Sunderland were said to be interested, I canâ€™t name any club specifically.</p>
      <p>"[But] they did not say anything to me, there was no official proposal.</p>
      <p>"For my development, it will be necessary to move abroad - I am aware of this, and if the opportunity arises, then I will definitely consider it."</p>
      <p>Celtic are well-stocked in defence, with Christopher Jullien and Kristoffer Ajer linking up well to provide a formidable central partnership, while the likes of Hatem Abd Elhamed, Moritz Bauer, Jeremie Frimpong, Boli Bolingoli and Jonny Hayes in the full-back areas.</p>
      <p>Jozo Simunovic is stepping up his return from injury while Nir Bitton and Jack Hendry can also operate at the back.</p>
      <p>Mustafazade is unlikely to be a primary target for Celtic but given his desire to play abroad, he could</p>
