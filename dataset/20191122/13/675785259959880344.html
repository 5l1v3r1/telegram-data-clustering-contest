      <h1>Man Utd 'monitor Richarlison' as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer eyes shock transfer move</h1>
      <h2>The Everton forward has scored five goals and created two assists for the Toffees so far this season and United are keeping a close eye on the Brazilian international</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:51:20+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United are reportedly lining up a surprise move for Everton's Richarlison as they look to add some firepower to their forward line in January.</p>
      <p>United have been linked with a whole host of attacking options recently, with Bournemouth's Callum Wilson and Mario Mandzukic of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> among them.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/man-utd-still-plotting-january-striker-swoop-despite-anthony-martial-form-saving-their-season-a4293061.html?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574357041">Standard</a> , however, Richarlison has emerged as a shock target, with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said to be a big fan of the player.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> would allow their star man to leave, with the 22-year-old their joint top scorer last year along with Gylfi Sigurdsson after bagging 13 Premier League goals.</p>

      <p>Although Anthony Martial has recently returned from injury to ease the burden on United's Marcus Rashford, the club are keen to add another forward, with Romelu Lukaku's goals still proving hard to replace following his transfer to Inter Milan over the summer.</p>
      <p>United have only scored 16 goals in 12 Premier League matches- a huge 19 behind the league's current top scorers <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p>And they believe Richarlison could go some way towards helping them provide more of a threat going forward.</p>
      <p>Richarlison first arrived in England when he joined <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> in 2017, and he immediately took the league by storm, scoring five goals in his first 12 games.</p>

      <p>He then followed Marco Silva to Everton the following summer in a Â£35m move and has impressed during his time at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>United should have another chance to watch Richarlison in action when the Toffees host Norwich on Saturday, with Silva's side aiming to build on their 2-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> last time out, in which Richarlison scored the winner.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer's team, meanwhile, face a tricky-looking trip to surprise package Sheffield United on Sunday.</p>
