      <p>SOUTH AFRICA: Exiled former Zanu PF political heavyweight Saviour Kasukuwere has said that freedom was nigh for Zimbabwe. Kasukuwere who is believed to be the leader of Generation 40 (G40) party that was decimated following Chiwenga’s November 2017 coup, skipped the country’s borders in haste after the demise of the late former president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe.</p>
      <p>His remarks come when there are reports suggesting that he plans to come and takeover ZANU PF leadership. It is believed that there are some G40 remnants in the ruling party who have been championing the agenda of dislodging President Emmerson Mnangagwa from power. William Gerald Mutumanje who is popularly known as Ace Lumumba posted on Twitter suggesting that Kasukuwere intended to come and dislodge Mnangagwa from being the ZANU PF leader.</p>
