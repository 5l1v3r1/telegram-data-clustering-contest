      </p>

      <p>76 per cent of its students boasted five or more Highers, and more than 70 per cent of pupils from the school go on to study at university.</p>
      <p>Six current S6 pupils have applied to Oxford and Cambridge, while on aims to travel across the Atlantic to study at Harvard.</p>
      <p>This is the second time the educational institution has scooped the award – after first picking up the huge prize in 2005.</p>
      <p>It finished <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4020266/scotland-secondary-schools-results-chart-worst-best-glasgow-edinburgh/#comments">behind Glasgow’s Jordanhill School</a>, which saw over 80 per cent of its students leave with five or more Highers.</p>
      <p>Stuart MacKay, who has been the headteacher of Dunblane High School since 2016, said: “For us it is about giving the young people the skills and the values which then allows them to access and take the opportunities that are available to them in what is an ever-changing world.”</p>
      <p>“We want our young people to leave Dunblane High School with the best possible set of examinations results as we possibly can.</p>
      <p>“But, more importantly, that they leave with the values and principles which will allow them to go out into the world and make a significant impact in the community.”</p>

      <p>Alastair McCall, editor of The Sunday Times Schools Guide, Parent Power, said: “Many school records were broken when the examination results were opened at Dunblane High last summer.</p>
      <p>“More children went on to university than ever before, and a stellar set of results at Advanced Higher, Higher and National 5 have lifted the school to second place in our state school rankings.</p>
      <p>“Children achieve at the top end of expectations in an atmosphere where excellence is encouraged, but also where achievement and hard work is recognised, both inside the classroom and out.</p>
      <p>“This second success for Dunblane High as Sunday Times Scottish State Secondary School of the Year is thoroughly deserved and recognises the outstanding efforts of staff and students alike.”</p>
      <p>Dunblane narrowly beat out Mearns Castle High School and St Ninian's High School in the overall rankings.</p>
      <p>Both East Renfrewshire schools saw 75 per cent of their pupils leave with five or more Higher qualifications.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Aberdeen’s St Margaret’s School for Girls has won The Sunday Times Scottish Independent Secondary School of the Year award.</p>
      <p>It outperformed rivals to become the highest achieving private school at Higher and Advanced Higher level.</p>
      <p>Anna Tomlinson, headteacher of St Margaret’s School for Girls since 2014, said: “It’s about individuals doing as well as they can and us finding out the best way to support them to do that.</p>
      <p>“We have a super team of staff here who are really dedicated. I just can’t stress that enough.</p>
      <p>“It is people being willing to go above and beyond and who really care about these girls. We are focused on creating an environment where they find their voice and gain in confidence.</p>
      <p>“But it is not just because we are a girls’ school, it is because we are a very good school.”</p>
