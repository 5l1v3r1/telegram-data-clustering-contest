      <p>Those were the results of a draw conducted in Nyon on Friday morning as UEFA determined the pairings of the 16 teams in the hunt for the four remaining places at next summer's finals.</p>
      <p>Steve Clarke's Scotland got a home draw against Israel, the side that finished fifth in Group G during regular qualifying. Scotland lost 2-1 away to Israel inÂ  October 2018 but won the Hampden rematch 3-2 the following month.</p>

      <p>Should Scotland win that, they will travel to the winner of the other Path C semi-final between Norway and Serbia five days later.</p>
      <p>Clarke said: "We played them in the Nations League group stage and hopefully we can get a positive start. I think they were two close games.</p>
      <p>"It'd be nice to repeat the win at Hampden. Every game will come with its own level of pressure and that's something we have to embrace."</p>
      <p>Asked whether the postponement of Ladbrokes Premiership games would help his team's cause, Clarke added on Sky Sports News: "The longer you get to prepare your team, the better for everyone.</p>
      <p>"There are hurdles to overcome, we will keep an open mind."</p>

      <p>It was already known that Northern Ireland will travel to Bosnia and Herzegovina while the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/republic-of-ireland/"><b>Republic of Ireland</b></a> are away to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/slovakia/"><b>Slovakia</b></a> but Friday's draw determined the location of the final in Path B.</p>
      <p>And the news offered a carrot to O'Neill. The 50-year-old, appointed Stoke boss earlier this month, plans to remain in charge of Northern Ireland for the play-offs but thought he may well have been in charge in Belfast for the final time in last weekend's goalless draw with Holland.</p>
      <p>However, either Northern Ireland or Bosnia will host the final, setting up the possibility of a match against the Republic at Windsor Park.</p>

      <p>In Path A, Hungary will travel to Bulgaria, with the winner hosting either Iceland or Romania in the final.</p>
      <p>In Group D, it was determined that the winner of the semi-final between Georgia and Belarus will host the final against either North Macedonia or Kosovo.</p>
      <p>The semi-finals will take place on March 26, with the finals on March 31.</p>
