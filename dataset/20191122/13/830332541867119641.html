      <p>(CNN) - <a href="https://cnn.com/2013/06/04/showbiz/elton-john-fast-facts/index.html">Elton John </a>fans will be able to snap up a piece of songwriting history when a rare collection of original handwritten lyrics goes on sale at <a href="https://cnn.com/style/article/switzerland-supercar-auction-teodoro-nguema-obiang-mangue-intl-scli/index.html">Bonhams</a> next month.</p>
      <p>The London-based auction house is selling a collection of six song lyrics handwritten for John by Bernie Taupin, the lyricist behind most of his greatest hits.</p>
      <p>The collection comprises original handwritten lyrics for "Your Song," "Bennie and the Jets," "Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road," "Candle in the Wind," "Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting" and<i> "</i>The Border Song," which features rare annotations by Elton John.</p>
      <p>Bonhams said the collection reveals Taupin's "careful wordcraft and his famously inconsistent spelling."</p>
      <p>Fans will need to dig deep to buy the memorabilia when it comes up for sale in Los Angeles on Dec. 9, however -- individual items have estimates of between $30,000 and $250,000.</p>
      <p>The lyrics are being sold from the collection of Bernie Taupin's ex-wife, Maxine Taupin -- who was the inspiration for the song "Tiny Dancer" and was privy to her former husband's creative writing process, Bonhams said.</p>
      <p>"When Bernie had completed an album's worth of lyrics, we would pay Elton a visit," she said.</p>
      <p>"I was always amazed how prolific they were. When I heard the finished songs, I was instantly transported to that magical place these two creative forces have been taking us all for so many years."</p>
