      <p>A mother who was a suspect in the case of her missing 5-year-old daughter tried to kill herself shortly after the girl’s body was believed to be found.</p>
      <p>Brianna Williams, 27, was rushed to a hospital after overdosing on unidentified pills on the same day authorities found remains while searching for her daughter, Taylor Williams, on November 12 in a wooded area in Alabama.</p>
      <p>Family members said Williams was on life-support after the incident, while investigators said she was in a medically-induced coma, but she has since recovered and was charged with two counts of child neglect while hospitalized. She was also charged with giving false information to police.</p>
      <p>Authorities said they believe the body they found is Taylor, but have yet to positively identify her. They are also still working to determine a time and cause of death.</p>

      <p>Brianna Williams was transferred to the Duval County jail in Jacksonville, Florida after spending nine days in the hospital, police said Thursday.</p>

      <p>Williams, a petty officer in the US Navy, reported her daughter missing from her home in Jacksonville on November 6, but she stopped cooperating with police once they questioned ‘inconsistencies’ in her story, police said.</p>
      <p>She originally told investigators that Taylor was gone when she awoke on the morning of November 6, but family members and several others told police that they have not seen the girl for a while.</p>
      <p>Williams also told investigators that the child had been staying with her grandmother, Brianna’s mother, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama throughout October – but her mother denied having the girl that month.</p>
      <p>Both maternal and paternal grandparents told police that they had not seen Taylor for more than a year. Records show the last time Taylor attended daycare on the naval base they lived on was April 29. An arrest warrant for Williams said Taylor was last seen in May.</p>

      <p>Forensic Expert Michael Knox told <a href="https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/crime/new-details-in-investigation-of-child-remains-found-near-brianna-williams-hometown/77-ffd37638-6bec-4a68-b54a-76e486b477d9">First Coast News</a> that the ‘last seen in May’ designation on Williams’ arrest report is a ‘telltale sign’ of foul play.</p>
      <p>Tonisha Williams, Brianna’s sister, said Brianna did not answer texts from her family for months leading up to the day her daughter was reported missing.</p>
      <p>‘The coroner’s position would be if, in fact, it’s clear to them that this child was dead long before the time that she was supposedly last seen by the mother,’ Knox said.</p>

      <p>‘That would be enough to show that the mother is doing something wrong here, that would tend to indicate some foul play.’</p>
      <p>Williams is due to be arraigned in December.</p>
