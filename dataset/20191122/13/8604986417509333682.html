      <p>As a business traveler, moving around the country or the globe eventually becomes second nature. When you're accustomed to jumping on flights for work, you may stop thinking about <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-discala/how-to-be-a-more-eco-conscious-business-traveler.html">the impact your traveling has</a> on each destination. However, business travelers can contribute to issues like overtourism just as much as those traveling for leisure.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, being aware of your travels and <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-discala/4-ways-to-better-plan-your-business-trips.html">planning ahead</a> can help business travelers be more aware of the problems that come with overtourism and even the <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-discala/the-flight-shaming-phenomenon-is-here-business-travelers-should-first-consider-these-4-factors-before-flying.html">flight shame</a> that may come with it. </p>
      <h3>What is overtourism?</h3>
      <p>Overtourism occurs when there are too many tourists in a given area. This is a very general term, as it is difficult to define what constitutes "too many" tourists. That said, when excessive tourism leads to negative changes in a particular destination, it can be classified as overtourism.</p>
      <p>Potential negative changes include congestion of roads and walkways, increased waiting times for various services, increased crime (like petty theft or pick pocketing), and even clashes with local residents. </p>
      <p>If a destination draws large crowds, overtourism can be difficult to avoid. Local governments or organizations can institute rules to mitigate tourist-related problems, including limiting the type of vehicles on certain roadways, imposing more fees for hotels, and limiting the marketing for popular attractions.</p>
      <p>However, there are also several changes that individuals, including business travelers, can make in order to combat overtourism.</p>
      <p>Naturally, the only way to completely avoid contributing to overtourism is to stay home. However, this is not a useful option for a business traveler. You may be able to form relationships digitally, but this is not always an option.</p>
      <p>Here are some ways business travelers can avoid contributing to overtourism.</p>
      <h3>Limit your time at high-profile attractions. </h3>
      <p>If you're traveling to Paris on business, you'll probably want to take in a few sights in your free time. While the Eiffel Tower and Louvre might be at the top of your list, they're also at the top of most other people's lists. However, this doesn't mean you have to completely avoid all high-profile attractions.</p>
      <p>If you really want to visit a popular destination, try not to linger. Simply enjoy the view, take a few pictures, and move on. If possible, visit major attractions early in the day. </p>
      <h3>Take the path less traveled. </h3>
      <p>Even when trying to avoid high-profile tourist attractions, you'll want to see what your destination has to offer. To do this, you will need to conduct research on some local attractions that are off the beaten path. Often times, visiting less-traveled places can be even more rewarding, as you do not need to battle large crowds or vendors.</p>
      <p>Plus, you may just find a unique networking opportunity that you wouldn't have known had you did what everyone else was doing.</p>
      <h3>Learn about the local culture.</h3>
      <p>Going to a new destination uninformed can lead to uncomfortable situations. For example, if you're traveling to Singapore, you will want to study up on local customs and ordinances. Singapore prides itself on being one of the cleanest cities in the world, which means that littering is strictly forbidden. </p>
      <p>Even spitting your gum out on the sidewalk can lead to a tongue-lashing from the locals, and potentially a fine. As a result, you should always learn about the culture in your destination to avoid negative interactions with the local residents or authorities.</p>
      <h3>Support local businesses.</h3>
      <p>A major consequence of overtourism is a consolidation of profits. As tourism grows in a given destination, larger companies move in, effectively pushing out many smaller, locally-owned businesses.</p>
      <p>To combat this, you can stay at family-owned hotels and inns, eat at local (non-chain) restaurants, and buy souvenirs or gifts from local vendors, rather than corporate-owned gift shops. Aim to support as many local businesses as possible. Rating them on social media and recommending them to colleagues can also be helpful. </p>
      <p>Try to stay near the place where you'll be working. Ideally, you'll be able to walk to your workplace.</p>
      <h3>Schedule your trip during the off-season. </h3>
      <p>While you won't always have complete control over your travel schedule, you may be able to rearrange a trip if it coincides with the peak tourist season. One less person traveling to a given destination during peak travel season doesn't sound like much, but every bit helps.</p>
      <p>If possible, avoid contributing to rush hour. If you can, carpool or head to work later. You can also use some of the <a href="https://www.johnnyjet.com/best-travel-credit-cards/">best travel credit card</a> perks, like lounge access or upgrades, to make the most of your trip. </p>
      <p>At the end of the day, the goal is to recognize and respect the people that live in that destination. As more people <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-discala/a-guide-to-booking-sustainable-accommodations-during-business-travel.html">engage in sustainable tourism</a> and conscious business travel, overtourism may become less of a problem.</p>
