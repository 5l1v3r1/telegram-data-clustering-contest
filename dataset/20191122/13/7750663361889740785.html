      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> have reportedly turned down the chance to sign <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/"><b>Chelsea</b></a> attacker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/willian/"><b>Willian</b></a> on a free transfer.</h2>

      <p>The Blues are <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/transfer-talk/news/willian-in-talks-over-new-chelsea-contract_379828.html">allegedly in negotiations</a> with the Brazil international over a new deal, but as it stands, the 31-year-old will be out of contract at the end of the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
      <p>Willian would be free to agree a pre-contract with a foreign club at the start of 2020 if he failed to sign an extension with Chelsea, and Barcelona have been <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/transfer-talk/news/barcelona-to-open-willian-talks-in-january_378827.html">strongly linked</a> with a swoop.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Defensa Central</i>, the South American has also been offered to Madrid, but <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/zinedine-zidane/"><b>Zinedine Zidane</b></a>'s side signalled that they would not be interested in signing him on a free transfer.</p>
      <p>The report claims that Los Blancos are not in the market for a new wide attacker due to the presence of Brazilian youngsters <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/vinicius-junior/"><b>Vinicius Junior</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rodrygo-goes/"><b>Rodrygo Goes</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Willian has contributed three goals and three assists in 15 appearances for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/frank-lampard/"><b>Frank Lampard</b></a>'s side this season.</p>
