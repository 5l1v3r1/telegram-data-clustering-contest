      <p>The Satmar Rebbe distributed $5 million to 150 anti-Zionist institutions</p>
      <p>Zalman Teitelbaum was in Israel to present the heads of the institutions with checks made out in shekels, <i>The Jerusalem Post</i> reported. The checks were distributed on Thursday night in the Satmar stronghold of Beit Shemesh.</p>
      <p>The ceremony to distribute the checks is called Pure Shekel.</p>
      <p>Satmar ideology holds that there should not be a Jewish state and the Jews should remain in exile until the redemption, or coming of the Messiah.</p>
      <p>Teitelbaum is in Israel for a 10-day visit to distribute the money and meet with his followers of his Hasidic movement.</p>
