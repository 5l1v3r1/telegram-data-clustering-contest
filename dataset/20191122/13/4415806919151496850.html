      <p>11-year-old Hailey Golden from Co. Mayo, looks after her three younger brothers who have special needs.</p>
      <p>Hailey said: "I would have been two or three when Conor was born and I didn't know anything was wrong with him until I was around five and that's when I started to help out, because my Mam and Dad would be under a lot of stress.</p>
      <p>"So I'd be there helping them and if they wanted a break I'd fill in helping him get fed and helping him get dressed."</p>
