      <h1>Jakarta ex-governor Ahok tapped for job at state energy firm Pertamina: reports</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:33:25+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/AFP" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Jakarta’s ex-governor, who was jailed for nearly two years on controversial blasphemy charges, was tapped Friday to <a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/pertahok-former-jakarta-governor-in-contention-to-lead-state-owned-enterprise-has-jokowis-backing/">oversee executives at Indonesian energy firm Pertamina</a>, media reports said, after it was hit by graft scandals.</p>
      <p>Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, better known as Ahok, will reportedly serve as head of state-owned Pertamina’s six-member board of commissioners.</p>
      <p>The appointment comes two months after a former managing director of the company was named a suspect in a corruption case, while its ex-CEO was jailed for eight years on graft charges this summer.</p>
      <p>“President Joko Widodo has decided that (Purnama) will be the new Pertamina president commissioner,” State-Owned Enterprises minister Erick Thohir was quoted by local media as saying Friday.</p>
      <p>Purnama, a political ally of Widodo, was Jakarta’s first non-Muslim governor in half a century and its first ethnic Chinese leader.</p>
      <p>He had been a popular politician who won praise for trying to clean up the traffic-clogged megacity and clamp down on rampant corruption.</p>
      <p>But his downfall came quickly after comments he made on the campaign trail during a re-election bid saw him accused of insulting Islam.</p>
      <p>The filmed remarks, which went viral online, sparked mass protests in Jakarta, spearheaded by conservative groups opposed to a non-Muslim leader and encouraged by his political rivals.</p>
      <p>In 2017, he was sentenced to two years’ jail, having lost the election to a Muslim challenger.</p>
