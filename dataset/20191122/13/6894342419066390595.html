      <h1>US Government Allows Microsoft To Trade With Huawei Once Again</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:55:04+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/heirul/" target="_blank">Heirul Kamel</a></address>
      <p>The US Department of Commerce has granted Microsoft a <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/198110/trade-licenses-with-huawei-will-soon-be-granted-to-us-companies/">license</a> to export mass-market software to Huawei on 20 November. The grant was issued following the <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/191954/huawei-90-days-license-extension-united-states/">US government’s decision</a> to extend a temporary license which allowed US companies to trade with the Chinese tech giant earlier this week for an additional 90 days.</p>
      <p>To date, Microsoft is part of a number of US companies that are allowed to supply goods to Huawei again. Prior to the ban, Microsoft had supplied the Chinese company with its Windows and Office licenses to be used in Huawei’s Windows-powered laptops. The Verge also reported that Microsoft briefly stopped selling Huawei laptops at its stores during the Trump administration’s crackdown on the Chinese company, but was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20977446/microsoft-huawei-us-export-license-windows-office-software">brought back again</a> in order to sell its remaining inventory of Huawei laptops.</p>

      <p>With this new license granted by the US Department of Commerce, Huawei will be able to continue to include the Windows operating system and other Microsoft software in their current and upcoming MateBook laptops. While things may be looking up for Huawei’s laptop production, not the same can be said in regards to its smartphones for the time being.</p>
      <p>Google’s application for the trade license has yet to be granted the US government. Once approved, Google may finally be able to reinstate its mobile services and apps into all Huawei’s current and future devices including its tablets and smartphones.</p>
