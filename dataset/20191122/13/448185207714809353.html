      <p><b>New Delhi</b><b>: </b>Rating agency ICRA expects India’s growth rate to further slowdown to 4.7 percent in Q2 FY2020, due to weak industrial output.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, the rating agency expects further deterioration in the growth rate of India’s GDP and the gross value added (GVA) at basic prices in year-on-year terms to 4.7 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively, in Q2 FY2020, from 5 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively, in Q1 FY2020.</p>
      <p>However, sectors such as agriculture and services may be able to “maintain the growth rate recorded in Q1 FY2020”.</p>
      <p>“With subdued domestic demand, investment activity, and non-oil merchandise exports weighing upon volume expansion, manufacturing growth is expected to decelerate further from the marginal 0.6 percent in Q1 FY2020,” said ICRA’s Principal Economist Aditi Nayar.</p>
      <p>“To some extent, lower raw material costs would bolster earnings, and may prevent manufacturing GVA from slipping into a YoY contraction in Q2 FY2020.” (IANS)</p>
