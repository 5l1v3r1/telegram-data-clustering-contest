And as shallow as it may seem, physical attributes are what attracts the bees to the honey. On this show, however, people only get to see their dates on the day they meet. In the meantime, they meet the family of the potential partner and the most impressive family wins a date for their single girl. This season kicks off with Edgar Ledwaba, a 34-year-old bachelor from Pretoria who wants a lady with a great charm but an even better body.</p>
