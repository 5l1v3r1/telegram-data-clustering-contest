        <p>2) Sofia is Joe's one and only. This moment is clearly posed, says Orbuch, but she's still buying into it. Here's why: "Joe is seriously looking at Sofia. His face is intense and serious," she says, which means his focus is all on her. And the body language that makes her extra positive about this? The angle of Joe's feet. They're pointing toward Sofiaa sign that he's actually thinking about her and not just posing as if he is. And then there's Joe's posture: "He's standing tall and confidently," Orbuch says, meaning he's sure about the love he shares with Sofia. Axelle/Bauer-Griffin</p>

          <p>3) Sofia wants to be wherever Joe is. "Sofia is behind Joe again, with her hands on his shoulders againalmost as if she saw his photo being taken and just had to come up behind him," says Orbuch. This move is significant, not because Sofia's trying to play it up for the cameras, but because she wants to be involved in everything that involves her partnereven if it's just a quick photo. She values togetherness, and the content look on Joe's face says he's all about having her along for the ride, too. In fact, Orbuch's confident he wouldn't have it any other way.

            <p>4) Joe is Sofia's rock when she needs one. Once again, Sofia's leaning on Joe, only this time she's <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/relationships/a19937594/10-ways-to-build-trust-in-your-relationship/">communicating her trust </a>in him. If and when she needs someone to have her back, she knows she can rely on himthe way she's pressed up against him is a clear sign. And Joe, sitting tall and upright, takes pride in being Sofia's support system when things get tough. Despite smiling for the camera, the angle of Sofia and Joe's kneespointing toward each otherreveal how mutually devoted they are. Even when their focuses are elsewhere, they've always got each other on the brain. Kevin Mazur/MTV1415</p>

              <p>5) They have similar goals. Walking in step is a sign that Sofia and Joe are "headed in the same direction" toward a joint future, says Orbuch. It also helps that Joe's hand is in his pocket. Surprised? It's body language that proves he's relaxed and confident when he's planning for a future with Sofia. This is all mega-positive body language, but Orbuch also notices that Joe is walking ahead of Sofia. That could mean he often takes the lead in the relationship (not a bad thing, if you're into that). But then again, Sofia is wearing heels, so she might just be catching up. Alessio Botticelli</p>

                <p>6) Joe adores Sofia and is so proud of her accomplishments. Here, it's obvious that Joe is proud of Sofia for receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (go, girl!). What you might have missed, though, is the way he's pulled her in close so their bodies could be pressed up against each otherit's how Orbuch knows there's a ton of love behind that forehead smooch. And then there's Sofia's closed eyes and genuine smilean expression of pure happinesswhich proves how much she appreciates having Joe as one of her biggest fans. Steve Granitz</p>
