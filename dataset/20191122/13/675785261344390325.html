      <p>A young mum has revealed how she transformed her entire kitchen into a dream family room, using just £60.</p>
      <p>Hannah Williams, 25, from Grays, Essex, decided to bite the bullet and decorate her kitchen after being fed up of looking at her dull, brown cupboard doors.</p>
      <p>Hannah, a junior project manager, said: "My partner Jordan, 28, and I moved into our flat in February 2018 and from day one I really wanted to redecorate the kitchen.</p>
      <p>"I kept nagging Jordan about it but he kept pushing it back so, when he was away in Ireland one weekend, I decided to just do it myself as I was tired of it looking so dull.</p>

      <p>"I'd seen articles online about people doing up their kitchens on a budget, so thought I'd give it a go.</p>
      <p>"I did the majority of it by myself over the May bank holiday weekend - my dad helped a little bit here and there too."</p>
      <p>Hannah, who was pregnant at the time, made the kitchen look completely different in just four days and kept the renovation cheap by getting items from places like Amazon, B&amp;Q, and Wilko's.</p>
      <p>The now mum of one added: "I didn't realise you could just paint over the cupboard doors, I thought you had to get new ones completely.</p>
      <p>"Once I realised, I went to B&amp;Q and bought some of their GoodHome multi surface paint for cupboard doors for just £20 - a hell of a lot cheaper than getting them refitted!"</p>
