        <b>Carlos Sainz says that he is looking forward to the continuity of being at McLaren for a second consecutive season, saying that he is excited by the chance to work with a team for a second consecutive season. Sainz has performed terrifically for McLaren this season, scoring his first podium finish at the recent Brazilian Grand Prix from 20th on the grid.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Spaniard has been on the move a lot in recent seasons, switching Toro Rosso for Renault for the last few races of 2017, before jumping from the French team to McLaren for the start of this season.</p>

      <p>Sainz told Autosport: <i>"I'm a strong believer that the more time a driver spends in one team, the faster that driver becomes with that car.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"That's a rule that you can see pretty much in every team. You can see it with Max [Verstappen] in Red Bull, that for the longer he's been in Red Bull he's just been stronger and stronger, Lewis [Hamilton] with Mercedes he's been stronger and stronger every year.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"I was looking forward to having this in McLaren, and we are already working on the simulator on next year's car, already developing every weekend and giving ideas to the factory to what do we need for next year's car.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Hopefully that will have an impact on next year, the way we drive the car and what we need is very simple. It makes sense as a driver to develop a car for a couple of years."</i>
