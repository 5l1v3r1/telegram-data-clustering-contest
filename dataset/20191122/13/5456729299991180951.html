      <h1>Appeal Court upholds Tambuwal's re-election as Sokoto governor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:39:21+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/nwest/364616-appeal-court-upholds-tambuwals-re-election-as-sokoto-governor.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The Court of Appeal in Sokoto on Friday upheld the re-election of Governor Aminu Tambuwal as Sokoto governor.</p>
      <p>The four-member panel in a unanimous decision upheld Mr Tambuwalâ€™s election after dismissing the appeal filed by the governorship candidate of the <a href="https://www.allprogressivescongress.org/">All Progressives Congress</a>(APC), Ahmed Aliyu, for lacking in merit.</p>
      <p>Delivering judgment, Justice Hussein Mukhtar held that the judgment of the lower tribunal was in order and that the petitioners had failed to establish their claims to non-compliance with the Electoral Act and the issue of over-voting.</p>
      <p>Mr Aliyu challenged the tribunal judgment that affirmed the election of Mr Tambuwal of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the 2019 governorship election in the state.</p>

      <p>The governorship election held on March 9 was declared inconclusive following the cancellation of 75,403 votes which were higher than the 3,413 votes margin between the leading candidates.</p>
      <p>The re-run was then conducted on March 23 and led to the victory of Mr Tambuwal who won with a slim margin of 342 votes.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the Governorship Election Tribunal, on October 2, in Abuja affirmed the election of Mr Tambuwal.</p>
      <p>The three-member tribunal led by Justice Abbas Bawale dismissed the petition of the APC and its governorship candidate, Mr Aliyu, for lacking in merit.</p>
      <p>Unsatisfied with the tribunal judgment, Mr Aliyu on October 16, filed a notice of appeal challenging the judgment of the lower court, asking the court to set aside the tribunal judgment and declare him as the winner of the election.</p>
