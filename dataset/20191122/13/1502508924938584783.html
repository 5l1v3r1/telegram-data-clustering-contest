      <p>CasaOne, a furniture rental company, on Friday said it has raised $16 million (about Rs 114 crore) in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/funding">funding </a>led by Accel.</p>
      <p>The series B round also saw participation from existing investors JLL Spark, Freestyle Capital, NextWorld Capital and Array Ventures, a statement said.</p>
      <p>New investors include Quiet Capital, HNI and WeWork and a few prominent angel investors including Lydia Jett from Softbank's Vision Fund, it added.</p>
      <p>"This round of financing will help CasaOne expand to new geographies, further invest in hiring technology and engineering talent and expand into adjacent product categories," it said.</p>
      <p>CasaOne launched its furniture rental solution in 2017. With increased demand from businesses, BureauOne was launched in May 2019 to cater to fast-growing companies, mid-market firms and enterprises to convert their FF&amp;E (furniture, fixtures and equipment) into a utility.</p>
      <p>CasaOne operates out of six markets - Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p>"At CasaOne and BureauOne, we are building technology for real-time inventory, supply chain and large format logistics for the old school furniture and logistics industries," Shashank P S, founder and CEO of CasaOne, said.</p>
      <p>With the new raise, the company plans to further double down on engineering and market expansion, he added.</p>
