      <p>STOWE, Vt. (AP) — Snowboarders are taking turns down a Vermont mountain on the opening day of the season as a tribute to a pioneer in the sport who died this week.</p>
      <p>Jake Burton Carpenter died Wednesday of cancer complications. He had founded Burton Snowboards in Vermont.</p>
      <p>Employees boarded a chairlift Friday at Snow Mountain Resort in the rain to ride to the top for a ceremony. They then took turns down the mountain.</p>
      <p>Resort employee Jeff Wise said it was an emotional first day.</p>
      <p>Carpenter brought the snowboard to the masses and helped turn the sport into a billion-dollar business.</p>
      <p>He quit his job in New York in 1977 to form his company with a goal of advancing the rudimentary snowboard.</p>
      <p>It had been invented by Sherman Poppen and was called a Snurfer at the time.</p>
