      <h1>Barcelona’s key target closes in on Real Madrid move</h1>

      <h3>Barca have scouted Inter Milan Defender, Milan Skriniar, as their long term replacement for aging Gerard Pique. The defender’s representative, however, claims that rivals Real Madrid are closing in on the move.</h3>
      <p>The Slovakia international has been highly impressive for the Serie A side this season and is currently wanted by many European giants including Real Madrid and Barcelona.</p>
      <p>Amidst interests from English clubs like Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City, the two Spanish giants have <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7705751/Real-Madrid-beating-Barcelona-race-Milan-Skriniar-agent.html"><b>reportedly</b></a> claimed to be willing to make significant bids for the defender.</p>
      <p>Mithat Halis, an executive at Star and Friends [Agency that represents Skriniar], has valued the player at 100 million Euros and also stated that Real Madrid are the club that are closing in on the player’s move.</p>
      <blockquote>“Skriniar is worth €100million. Real Madrid and Barcelona are competing for his signing for the last two years, Now Real Madrid are closer to reaching an agreement with Inter Milan because they want and they need him much more than Barcelona,”  he told <a href="https://en.as.com/en/2019/11/19/football/1574183525_901463.html"><b>AS</b></a>.</blockquote>
      <p>The 24-year-old joined Internazionale in 2017 from Sampdoria for a fee of roughly 28 million euros.<a href="https://en.as.com/en/2019/11/19/football/1574183525_901463.html"><b> Reports</b></a> claim that Manchester City offered 55 million euros just after six months but the request was turned down. Inter Milan made the right choice as the defender is currently valued around €100m and has a promising future ahead of him.</p>
      <p>The Slovakian’s current contract runs until 2023 and is a vital part of Antonio Conte’s squad this season, having made 16 appearances across Serie A and Champions League.</p>
      <p>A move in January is unlikely due to the player’s status as the top defender in the Italian League and thus Milan would be reluctant to lose such a talent However a move next summer seems evident as many European giants line up to bid for the Slovakian.</p>
      <p>Would Milan Skriniar be a good fit for Barca?</p>
