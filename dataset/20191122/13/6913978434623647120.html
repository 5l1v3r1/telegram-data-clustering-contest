      <p><b>COLOMBO — </b>Sri Lanka's new president said Friday that he will call a snap parliamentary election in March following his sweeping victory at the weekend.<br/><br/>Gotabaya Rajapaksa is hoping to ride a wave of popularity by calling an election six months before the current parliament's five-year term expires on March 1.<br/><br/>"I will consult the people at the earliest opportunity I get under the constitution," he said, after swearing-in a new Cabinet headed by his brother Mahinda, a former president who will now serve as premier and finance minister.<br/><br/>The brothers are credited with brutally defeating Tamil separatist militants in 2009 to end Sri Lanka's bloody civil war, making them adored among the majority Sinhalese-Buddhist majority.<br/><br/>For the same reason they are feared by many Tamils, and also among the Muslim minority who have seen increased hostility since extremist attacks killed 269 people in April.<br/><br/>Currently the Rajapaksas and their allies have just 96 lawmakers in the 225-seat parliament, making it hard for them to pass legislation.<br/><br/>The opposition of outgoing premier Ranil Wickremesinghe is also six MPs short of a majority.<br/><br/>The new 16-member Cabinet also includes another Rajapaksa brother, Chamal, who was made minister of agriculture and irrigation in addition to trade.<br/><br/>Foreign affairs was given to Dinsesh Gunawardena, 70, a leader of a small Sinhala nationalist party in coalition with the ruling party.<br/><br/>The only female in the cabinet, Pavitra Wanniarachchi, will take on women's affairs and health.<br/><br/>Nobody was named to the defense or law and order portfolios.<br/><br/>The International Monetary Fund said earlier this month that Sri Lanka's economy was slowly recovering from the devastating effects of the April 21 attacks.<br/><br/>But the international credit rating agency Fitch warned Thursday that the new president's pledges to increase social spending, public-sector wages and pensions could damage Sri Lanka's public finances.<br/><br/>During Mahinda's 2005-15 presidency, Sri Lanka borrowed almost $7 billion from China for infrastructure projects — many of which turned into white elephants mired in corruption — pushing up Sri Lanka's debts.<br/><br/>In a possible sign that he intends to avoid a repeat of Sri Lanka's strategic drift towards Beijing under his brother, Gotabaya's first official trip abroad will be to India next week. — AFP</p>
