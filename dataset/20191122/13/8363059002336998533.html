      <h1>Microsoft Does Black Friday Too, Slashes Price of the Surface Pro 7 and Surface Book 2</h1>

      <p>Everyone does Black Friday, and the more expensive the device is normally the better the sale price seems to be. Microsoft's Surface devices are pretty pricey at the best of times - even if they are cheaper than Macbooks. Still dropping that much money isn't fun, and Black Friday discounts like this make buying a fancy new tablet or laptop much more appealing.</p>
      <p>The first one is a saving of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/surface-pro-7-type-cover-bundle/8w7mjmxs0s4k?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">up to £379 on the Surface Pro 7 bundled with the Type Cover.</a> Prices start at £700 if you buy the cheapest Surface (i3, 4GB Ram, 128GB SSD) and the standard Type Cover, though naturally picking a more expensive tablet and opting for the Signature Type Cover is going to increase the price a bit.</p>
      <p>You can also save <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/surface-pro-7/8n17j0m5zzqs">£225 on the Surface Pro 7 on its own</a>, with prices starting at £719, plus <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/surface-book-2/8mcpzjjcc98c?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab">up to £630 off the Surface Book 2 laptop</a> (starting at £919). Naturally, with all the different hardware configurations available, those prices will increase if you decide to opt for a better machine.</p>
      <p>There's nothing on other Microsoft products yet, like the Xbox and its associated games, but with Black Friday still a week away there's plenty of time for them to appear.</p>
