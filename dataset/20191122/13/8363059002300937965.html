      <h1>Bristol Lego Event Suspected of Triggering Mass Vomiting Outbreak</h1>

      <p>As many as 40 people have spent several days pointing both ways at a toilet in the Bristol area, after a suspected outbreak of norovirus struck among attendees at a shared Lego building and selling experience in Bristol.</p>
      <p>The affected visitors were at the Bristol Brick Show in the Action Indoor Sports Centre last weekend, where interlocking plastic brick enthusiasts gathered to show off their collections and sell off unwanted sets. That was fun but the aftermath wasn't, as Bristol City Council says it's now investigating a city-wide vomiting outbreak experienced by the event's visitors.</p>
      <p>The organiser says it wasn't to blame as mass groups of people touching the same objects and breathing the same air is a health disaster waiting to happen anyway, and said: "Unfortunately there were no reports of sickness made during the duration of the show therefore we had no way of warning anyone nor identifying a source at the time."</p>
      <p>The fans don't seem to mind, though, as Lego enthusiasts are generally understanding. Maybe next year there may be more aggressive laminated reminders on site telling guests to wash their hands, though. [<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/norovirus-outbreak-at-lego-brick-show-being-investigated-11866270">Sky News</a>]</p>
