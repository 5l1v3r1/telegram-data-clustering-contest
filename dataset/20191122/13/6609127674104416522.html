      <p>Mekala has spent months in intensive care in a hospital in Hoi An, Da Nang.</p>
      <p>Mum Yvonne and stepdad Jimmy McAulay, 64, both jetted out to be at her side.</p>
      <p>And it emerged Mekala, from Wallyford, East Lothian, was to be transported to Singapore “as a matter of urgency”.</p>
      <p>Now it's understood that she will finally fly back to the UK this weekend, after months in hospital abroad.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-50513545?ns_linkname=scotland&amp;ns_source=twitter&amp;ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_campaign=bbc_scotland_news">BBC</a> reports that her condition deteriorated so badly her family was told she had a 5% chance of survival.</p>
      <p>And that she's now been moved onto a portable ventilator and is well enough to come home.</p>
      <p>Jimmy said: " It has taken a long time to get her well enough to travel and cope with the cabin pressure.</p>
      <p>"When she gets back she is likely to be in intensive care for two weeks.</p>
      <p>"She will need intense physio due to muscle wastage.<br/>"They say it will be a year before she is back to full health."</p>
      <p>Well-wishers have raised over £12,000 to help support Mekala's family with the costs of travel and treatment.</p>
