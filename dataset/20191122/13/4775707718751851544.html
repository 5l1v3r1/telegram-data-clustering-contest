      <p>Reports are surfacing that Capcom are going to release a remake of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis in 2020. No official sources or exact release dates have been confirmed, but thanks to the runaway success of the remade <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Resident-Evil-2/achievements">Resident Evil 2</a> back in January, we expect that Capcom are already hard at work on development to make the most of the hype.</p>
      <p>The news first surfaced via YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksBrLDX8SCM&amp;feature=youtu.be">SpawnWave</a>, with no real verification to back it up – but now a few journalists including folks at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-22-sources-resident-evil-3-remake-in-development">Eurogamer</a> are claiming to have heard the same news from their own inside sources. It's also worth noting that SpawnWave broke news about the From Software and George R.R. Martin collaboration Elden Ring ahead of its official reveal at E3.</p>
      <p>The timing of the release will be interesting. Not everyone was happy to hear about Capcom's Left 4 Dead style spin-off <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n38950/project-resistance-mr-x">Project Resistance</a>, hoping instead for news of a full single-player Resident Evil 8 or further remakes of the older canon. Perhaps this is Capcom's reaction to that blowback and the large revenues generated by Resident Evil 2 by the end of the last financial quarter. What remains to be seen is whether Nemesis will turn up ahead of Resistance to keep the hype alive, or if it will be out later in the year as a safety net if Resistance doesn't work out. Regardless, Resident Evil fans are pretty excited, or possibly terrified, to see Nemesis get the same upscaling as Mr. X in Resident Evil 2.</p>
      <p>If you're not sure what the fuss is all about, maybe you should take advantage of the fact that Resident Evil 2 Remake is in the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39784/xbox-black-friday-sale-2019-xbox-one-and-windows-games-bundles-and-dlc">Xbox Black Friday Sale</a> – check your local prices below.</p>
