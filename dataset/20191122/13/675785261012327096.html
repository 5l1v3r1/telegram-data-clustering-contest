      <h1>Beyoncé and Jay Z 'uncoupling' tweet tricks thousands - but for very good cause</h1>
      <h2>A tweet claiming Beyoncé and Jay Z have decided to 'consciously uncouple' has gone viral on social media, but before you panic, it isn't what it seems</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T13:30:07+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, https://www.facebook.com/courtneypochinmirror/?modal=admin_todo_tour</a></address>
      <p>If you've been on Twitter today, you might have seen a post claiming everyone's favourite power couple <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/beyonce">Beyoncé</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jay-z">Jay Z</a> have decided to 'consciously uncouple'.</p>
      <p>But before you start sobbing and declaring that love is officially dead, let me reassure you that it's not true.</p>
      <p>The post is actually a very sneaky trick to encourage people to register to vote in the upcoming UK <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> on December 12.</p>
      <p>A man named Marvyn Harrison is responsible for the tweet, which has been liked and retweeted thousands of times.</p>
      <p>It reads: "Beyoncé and her 'rapper' husband Jay Z confirm their 'conscious uncoupling' via @BBCBreaking."</p>

        <figcaption>The link takes people to the register to vote page on Gov.uk</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Alongside this, there is a link which many thought was a BBC news article, but when clicked, it actually directs to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote">register to vote page</a> at Gov.uk.</p>
      <p>Marvyn, a communications strategist from London said he shared the tweet in the hopes all voices will be heard at the polls.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/">Mirror Online,</a> he explained: "I know people are suffering political and voting exhaustion but all voices are needed to be heard so I wanted to put it in an interesting way."</p>
      <p>He continued to say the response to the tweet has been "amazing" and that it has clearly made some people feel "an element of guilt" for not registering sooner.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> users have taken the time to comment on the post, with many congratulating him on the "brilliant" idea and some saying it had served its purpose and pushed them to finally register.</p>
      <p>One person wrote: "Under any other circumstances I would have been P***ED that this was fake. But this is for a noble reason."</p>
      <p>Another replied that it was an example of "how to use click-bait for the greater good".</p>
      <p>A third added: "I was like Yass! She finally binned him, then I was Yass! Register to vote."</p>
      <p>However not everyone was quite so impressed, a different user said: "I was genuinely worried."</p>
      <p>Someone else responded: "You're a bad, bad guy."</p>
      <p>To those unhappy with his post, Marvyn does want to say he's sorry.</p>
      <p>"Apologies to all who were misled and to Beyoncé and Jay Z for using their marriage as bait, I hope they stay united for many years to come."</p>
      <p>He added: "Please vote."</p>
