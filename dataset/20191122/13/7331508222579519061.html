      <h4><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/car/carolina-panthers">Carolina Panthers</a> at <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-saints">New Orleans Saints</a> (-9.5, 47)</h4>
      <p><b>Bearman:</b> With their pasting of the Buccaneers last week, the Saints proved the Week 10 loss to Atlanta was an aberration. After struggling to come up with any offense in the loss to the Falcons, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2580/drew-brees">Drew Brees</a> and company had no issues in Tampa, jumping out to a 20-0 lead 25 minutes into the game. In all, the Saints have covered seven of the past eight games, and their past three wins were by double figures.</p>
