      <p><b>Updated November 22, 2019:</b> Civilization VI appears to be running at 60 frames per second on Xbox One X. The resolution is also very high, but due to some "shimmering" around the edges of various textures, we believe it's 1800p instead of 4K. It looks absolutely glorious on the 4K display and the controller support is perfect.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/long-awaited-civilization-vi-rise-and-fall-expansion-out-now-pc">Civilization VI</a> is the latest installment in the acclaimed franchise. Civilization was originally created by legendary designer Sid Meier back in 1991. The series consists of many turn-based strategy games in which you attempt to build an empire to stand the test of time. You must lead a civilization from the Stone Age to the Information Age while dealing with all of the challenges that accompany advancement.</p>
      <p>A few months ago, 2K Games announced that Civilization VI was coming to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-one-s">Xbox One</a> and PlayStation 4. It's already available on PC and Nintendo Switch. You can now purchase the game for $60 through the Microsoft Store. There's also an <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.msafflnk.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F433017%2F7593%3FsubId1%3DUUwpUdUnU72067YYw%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.microsoft.com%252Fen-us%252Fp%252Fcivilization-vi-expansion-bundle%252F9nv0w0fx5hss%253Fcid%253Dmsft_web_chart%2526activetab%253Dpivot%25253Aoverviewtab&amp;token=53182663">Expansion Bundle</a> available for $50.

      <p>Civilization VI features <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-one-x">Xbox One X</a> enhancements and should look great on the system. It's unclear what the resolution is at the moment, but in our early testing, it appears to be running at a higher resolution on the console.</p>
      <p>In Windows Central's <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/civilization-vi-xbox-one-review">review</a>, Jez Corden wrote, "If you've been enjoying almost any type of strategy game on Xbox One, such as Stellaris, Surviving Mars, or even more action-oriented games like XCOM, Halo Wars, or Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden, Civilization VI combines the best of several types of strategy gameplay styles at a pace almost anyone can enjoy."</p>
