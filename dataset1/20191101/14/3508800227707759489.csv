小說《擺渡人》：妳不是唯一從那列火車逃出來的人，妳是唯一沒逃生的
01 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是「我當時是在等妳。」她的眉毛困惑地皺在一起，可是她仍沒說話......「妳不是唯一一個從那列火車逃出來的人，荻倫。」他的聲音低到只剩下耳語，彷彿他正在調降音量好減小爆炸的力道。「妳是唯一沒逃生的。」



文：克萊兒．麥克福爾
「荻倫，我之前是在騙妳的，」他開始說。
他看見她的瞳孔微微擴張，但沒有其他反應。他明白了，她早就知道他在說謊。但她不確定是哪些事。
「我不在那列火車上。」
他頓住，估量她的反應。他原本預期會被她一連串問題打斷，或者盤問，或者指控，但都沒有，她只是等待著，像一尊石像。她的眼睛宛如盛滿恐懼與不安的水潭；她害怕他即將要說出的，但儘管如此，她仍然決心要聽完它。
「我是……」崔斯坦的聲音微顫，停頓。該怎麼說呢？「我當時是在等妳。」
她的眉毛困惑地皺在一起，可是她仍沒說話，這讓他很欣慰。對崔斯坦來說，沒聽見她的聲音比較容易把話說出口。但他也不希望沒看著她的眼睛就說出傷害她的話。
「妳不是唯一一個從那列火車逃出來的人，荻倫。」他的聲音低到只剩下耳語，彷彿他正在調降音量好減小爆炸的力道。「妳是唯一沒逃生的。」
這句話說得清楚明白，可是那些字漂浮在荻倫腦海中，拒絕組成意義。她調開視線不去看他，轉而凝視地板上的一片破磁磚，以便好好思考他剛才所說的意思。
在她身旁的崔斯坦不自在地蠕動身體，等待她的回應。一分鐘過去了，又一分鐘。她動也沒動。只有偶爾顫抖的嘴脣，讓她看起來不像個雕像。
「我很抱歉，荻倫。」他補了一句，不像是隨意說說的，而是真心誠意。雖然他不明白為什麼，但他不喜歡造成她的痛苦，如果有也希望能夠收回。但是既定的事實是沒辦無法按鍵取消的。這些事情亙古不變。他沒有能力改變，就算他有，那麼做也是錯的。他不能扮演神的角色。他看著她眨眨眼睛，知道她已經逐漸理解了，隨時就會爆發出激烈的情緒反應。他屏息，不安地等待著。他很怕她會嚎啕大哭。
結果出乎他的意料。
「我死了嗎？」她終於開口問。
他點點頭，不太敢開口。他已經伸出手臂準備好要擁抱傷心大哭的她。然而，她卻出奇地平靜。她點點頭，嘆了口氣，然後自顧自地露出微笑。
「我想，或許我早就知道了，在某個時刻。」
不，這樣說不全然正確，荻倫想。她並不是早就知道……而是在她腦海深處的某個地方，她的潛意識把所有不對勁的事情全都標記了下來，所有不合情理的那些事情。那些太過詭異的事情，奇怪到根本不像真實生活裡會發生的事情。雖然她無法解釋為什麼，但等到她認清了真相，反倒一點也不覺得恐懼。只是鬆了一口氣而已。
她想到再也無法看見瓊或凱蒂，也永遠沒法跟她爸爸相聚，享受他們之間或許能擁有的關係，她又想到永遠不會出社會工作、婚姻、小孩。她感覺到一股憂傷揪住她的心弦，但在這無數的念頭之上，卻有一種內在的安詳壟罩一切。如果這是真的，而且她打從心眼知道這是真的，那麼它就變成現實，無法改變。但她依然在這裡，她依然是她，這是值得感恩的事。
「我在哪裡？」她平靜地問。
「荒原，」崔斯坦回答。她抬頭看他，等著他多說一點。「這是世界與世界之間的陸地。妳必須跨越它。每個人都是。這是每個人獨有的荒野。妳會在這裡發現自己已經死去的事實，然後接受它。」
「那些呢？」荻倫朝窗外作了個手勢，「牠們是什麼？」
雖然嘈雜聲已經消失，但荻倫相信那些奇怪的生物並沒有離去。牠們只是在等待，等待時機，希望得到另一次攻擊的機會。
「惡魔，我猜你們是這樣稱呼牠們。食腐獸。幽靈。當靈魂在跨越荒原時，牠們會伺機攻擊。當我們越靠近另一個世界時，牠們就會越急切，攻擊力道也會越加猛烈。」
「那我們該怎麼辦？」她的聲音宛若呢喃。
崔斯坦聳聳肩，沒有回答。
「告訴我。」她催促。她一定得知道，好做準備。她不想繼續盲目無知。
他嘆氣說，「如果牠們抓到妳，當然牠們是抓不到的，那麼牠們就會把妳拉到地底下去。那些被牠們抓到的靈魂，我們再也沒見過了。」
「你去過底下嗎？」荻倫揚起眉毛問。
「詳細的情況我不是很清楚。」崔斯坦安靜地回答。她皺著眉頭，不太滿意這個答案，不過可以感覺得出他並沒有說謊。「我只知道，當牠們終結了妳以後，妳就會變成牠們的一分子。狠毒，飢渴，瘋狂。有如煙霧一般的惡靈。」
荻倫視而不見地凝望著。一想到變成牠們當中的一分子，她嚇壞了。尖聲厲叫，絕望，暴力；牠們是讓人憎惡的生物。
「我們在這裡安全嗎？」
「安全，」崔斯坦很快地回答，盡力想安撫她。「這些建築物都是安全的處所，牠們沒辦法進來。」
她安靜地接受了，可是崔斯坦知道她還會再問其他問題，更多她必須知道的真相。
他也會告訴她答案，在他能力所及的範圍。至少這是她應得的。
「那你呢？」
她只問了這幾個字，卻影射著千百個問題。他是誰？他要帶領她前往的是什麼樣的生活？在那個世界裡，他扮演著什麼樣角色？其中絕大多數的答案崔斯坦都無權回答，而且說真的他也不全然知道；不過仍然有一些事情是他可以告訴她的，她有權利知道的事。
「我是一個擺渡人，」他開始說。原本他一直在凝視著自己的雙手，這時抬頭迅速瞄了她一眼。只見她一臉疑惑。他深吸一口氣，繼續說：「我引導靈魂跨越過荒原，保護他們不被惡靈侵害。我會讓他們知道他們已經死了，然後，送他們去該去的地方。」
「那是什麼地方？」
關鍵問題。「我不知道。」他悲傷地笑了，「我從來沒進去過。」
這回答讓荻倫不敢置信。「那你怎麼知道那個地方是正確的？你把人送到就走開了？搞不好你所知道的一切，就只是地獄的大門！」
崔斯坦寬容地點點頭，可是他的回答卻很斬釘截鐵。「我就是知道。」
她看起來並沒有被說服，張嘴似乎還想說什麼，不過最後她並沒有咬住這點繼續爭辯。崔斯坦鬆了一口氣。他不想要欺騙她，可是有一些事情不是他能對她說的。
「有多少人了……你曾經……」荻倫問，不太確定她的問題該怎麼措辭才好。「引路過的？」
他抬頭往上看，這一次他的眼睛裡有著明顯的悲傷。「這個我真的沒法說。大概有幾千個或幾百萬個吧。我已經做這個很久了。」
「你多大了？」荻倫問。
這是他可以回答的問題，但他不想說。他覺得，如果她知道真相，如果他知道他已經在這裡徘徊很久了——不像正常人那樣學習、成長、經驗，而只是存在著——那麼，他們之間脆弱的連結就會斷掉。她會把他當成一個老朽，某個奇怪的傢伙和異類，他發現自己不希望她這麼看待他。他試著用玩笑來引開話題。
「我看起來有多大了？」他伸出雙手，讓她檢查。
「十六歲，」她說，「可是你應該不是這年紀。你是在這年紀死掉的嗎？所以你沒辦法變老，對嗎？」
「精確說，我從來沒有真正活過，」他回答，眼底有一絲惆悵。但很快地轉變成戒備的神色。他已經說溜嘴太多他不應該說的事。很慶幸的，她似乎讀懂了他的表情，沒再多問。

The novel ""The Ferryman"": Isn't it the only person who escaped from the train, the only one who didn't escape?
01 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Summary


What we want you to know is ""I was waiting for you."" Her eyebrows wrinkled in confusion, but she still didn't speak... ""Is not the only one who escaped from that train."" , Karen."" His voice was so low that only whispers were left, as if he was lowering the volume to reduce the power of the explosion. ""Hey is the only one who has not escaped.""



Text: Claire. McFall
""Well, I was cheating before,"" he began.
He saw her pupils dilate slightly, but there was no other reaction. He understood that she had known that he was lying. But she is not sure what it is.
""I am not on that train.""
He paused and estimated her reaction. He had expected to be interrupted by her series of questions, or cross-examined, or accused, but none, she just waited, like a stone statue. Her eyes are like a pool of fear and uneasiness; she is afraid of what he is about to say, but despite this, she is determined to listen to it.
""I am..."" Tristan's voice trembled and paused. What should I say? ""I was waiting for you at the time.""
Her eyebrows wrinkled in confusion, but she still didn't speak, which made him very happy. For Tristan, it is easier to speak out without hearing her voice. But he did not want to say anything that hurt her without looking at her eyes.
""Isn't the only one who escaped from that train, Karen."" His voice was so low that only whispers were left, as if he was lowering the volume to reduce the power of the explosion. ""Hey is the only one who has not escaped.""
This sentence is clear and clear, but those words float in the mind of the sin, refuse to form meaning. She turned her eyes away from seeing him and turned to stare at a broken tile on the floor to think about what he said.
Tristan, who was next to her, squirmed uncomfortably and waited for her response. One minute passed, another minute. She didn't move at all. Only the occasional trembling lips made her look like a statue.
""I am very sorry, Karen."" He added that it is not like casual talk, but sincere. Although he did not understand why, he did not like to cause her pain, and if so, hope to recover. However, the established fact is that there is no way to cancel the button. These things have never changed. He has no ability to change, even if he has it, then it is wrong. He can't play the role of God. He looked at her and blinked, knowing that she had gradually understood, and there was a fierce emotional reaction at any time. He held his breath and waited uneasily. He is very afraid that she will cry.
The result was beyond his expectations.
""I am dead?"" she finally asked.
He nodded and didn't dare to speak. He has stretched out his arm and is ready to hug her crying. However, she is surprisingly calm. She nodded and sighed, then smiled herself.
""I think, maybe I already knew it, at some point.""
No, this is not entirely correct, I think. She didn't know it long ago... but somewhere deep in her mind, her subconscious mind marked all the things that weren't right, all the unreasonable things. Those things that are too weird are strangely different from what would happen in real life. Although she could not explain why, but when she recognized the truth, she did not feel fear at all. Just a sigh of relief.
She thought that she could no longer see Joan or Katie, and she could never get together with her father and enjoy the relationship that they might have. She thought that she would never have social work, marriage, or children. She felt a sorrow and smothered her heart, but on this countless thoughts, there was an inner peace and glory. If this is true, and she knows that it is true, then it becomes a reality and cannot be changed. But she is still here, she is still her, this is something to be grateful for.
""Where am I?"" she asked calmly.
""The Waste Land,"" Tristan answered. She looked up at him and waited for him to say a little more. ""This is the land between the world and the world. You must cross it. Everyone is. This is the wilderness that everyone has. You will find the fact that you are dead here and accept it.""
""Those?"" Lun made a gesture outside the window. ""What are they?""
Although the noise has disappeared, Lun believes that those strange creatures have not left. They are just waiting, waiting for the opportunity, and wanting another chance to attack.
""Devil, I guess you call them like this. The scavengers. Ghosts. When the souls cross the wasteland, they will wait for an opportunity to attack. As we get closer to another world, the more eager they will be, the more aggressive the attack will be. violent.""
""What should we do?"" Her voice whispered.
Tristan shrugged and did not answer.
""Tell me."" She urged. She must know, so be prepared. She does not want to continue blindly ignorant.
He sighed and said, ""If they catch cockroaches, of course they can't catch them, then they will pull them down to the bottom of the earth. Those souls caught by them, we have never seen them again.""
""Have you been to the bottom?"" Karen raised his eyebrows and asked.
""I don't know very well about the details."" Tristan answered quietly. She frowned and was not satisfied with the answer, but she could feel that he did not lie. ""I only know that when they end up, they will become a part of them. They are poisonous, hungry, and crazy. It is like a smoke-like evil spirit.""
Lun looked at it blindly. She was frightened when she thought of becoming one of them. Screaming, desperate, and violent; they are abhorrent creatures.
""Are we safe here?""
""Safe,"" Tristan quickly replied, trying to calm her. ""These buildings are safe places and they can't come in.""
She accepted it quietly, but Tristan knew she would ask other questions and more truths she must know.
He will also tell her the answer, within the scope of his ability. At least this is what she deserves.
""how about you?""
She only asked these words, but it reflected thousands of questions. Who is he? What kind of life does he want to lead her to? What role does he play in that world? Most of the answers to Tristan have no right to answer, and he really doesn't know it at all; but there are still things that he can tell her, she has the right to know.
""I am a ferryman,"" he began. Originally, he had been staring at his own hands, then looked up and quickly glanced at her. I saw her face confused. He took a deep breath and continued: ""I guided the soul across the wasteland and protected them from evil spirits. I will let them know that they are dead, and then send them to the place where they should go.""
""Where is that?""
The key issue. ""I don't know."" He smiled sadly. ""I have never been in.""
This answer made Wu Lun unbelievable. ""Then how do you know that the place is right? If you send people away, you will go away? If you don't know everything you know, it is just the door to hell!""
Tristan nodded tolerantly, but his answer was very sloppy. ""I just know it.""
She didn't seem to be convinced, she seemed to want to say something, but in the end she didn't bite this and continued to argue. Tristan breathed a sigh of relief. He doesn't want to deceive her, but there are some things that he can't tell her.
""How many people are there... You used to..."" Karen asked, not sure how to word her words. ""Introduction?""
He looked up and saw that there was a clear sorrow in his eyes. ""I really can't say this. There are thousands or millions of them. I have been doing this for a long time.""
""How old are you?"" asked Karen.
This is a question he can answer, but he does not want to say. He feels that if she knows the truth, if he knows that he has been here for a long time - not like the normal people to learn, grow, experience, but only exist - then the fragile link between them will be broken. She would treat him as an old man, a strange guy and a stranger, and he found that he didn't want her to treat him like this. He tried to use a joke to lead the topic.
""How old is it?"" He extended his hands and asked her to check.
""Sixteen,"" she said. ""But you should not be old. Are you dead at this age? So you can't get old, right?""
""Accurately, I have never really lived,"" he replied, and there was a hint of guilt in his eyes. But quickly turned into a look of alert. He has said that there are too many things he shouldn't say. Fortunately, she seemed to understand his expression and did not ask more.
