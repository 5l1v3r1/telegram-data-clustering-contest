《你最該討好的人是你自己》：如果某個人就是你的全世界，那你的全世界有點小
01 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是女人常犯的錯誤是，總以為自己可以躲在誰的身後享受歲月靜好，一回頭才發現，自己的雙腳已經站在懸崖邊。從喪失經濟獨立的那一刻開始，慢慢地，會接連喪失情感獨立、人格獨立，直到獨立性也全面淪陷。



文：米夏
以前聽到過一句話：做女人比做男人好，進可攻，退可守。
這句話讓人不由得想笑：退，你能退到哪兒去？ 基本上，從你放棄努力、放棄獨立的那一刻開始，就已經種下隱患了。
娛樂圈中曾經有一段很特別的婚姻。36歲的著名音樂才子，喜歡上了十七歲的女孩。女孩在19歲那年嫁給才子，並生下一個女兒。
談及19歲的年齡差，才子曾經說過一段很出名的話：「她跟我在一起的時候還很年輕，甚至還沒進入社會，所以她的基本世界觀都是我塑造的。相比之下，找一個年齡比較大的、被周圍圈子的人塑造出來後你再去改變的妻子，後者多累人啊，而且更容易產生分歧。我老婆對這個世界的看法，甚至聽什麼音樂、看什麼電影，都是受我影響的，所以我們大部分的想法都很一致，我覺得這樣很幸福。」
當大家都在為這段感情紛紛叫好並樂見其成地送上祝福的時候，看到這段話，我卻感到後背發涼。如果一個人被塑造成注滿別人思想的人偶，那麼她自己又在哪裡？這種完全失去自我的生活，豈不是岌岌可危嗎？
果然，6年後，才子提出離婚，理由是「和她在一起生活我感到不快樂，我想要更多的自由和創作空間」。離婚一年後，回顧當時的感受，女孩在社群網站上寫著：「一切猝不及防，我像從童話世界被忽然扔進傾盆大雨中，渾身濕透。」
她承認，她和女兒的溫室堡壘坍塌了。
俗話說，女子本弱，為母則剛。經歷過失婚的痛苦以後，她終於醒悟：「我難道不能憑自己的能力給女兒一個更好的生活嗎，為什麼一定要做別人的附庸？」
好在一切還都不算晚，她才25歲。她找了合夥人，註冊了公司，開創了自己的服裝品牌，咬著牙，卯盡全力，重打鑼鼓重開張。
在最冷的季節，她把自己裹成粽子，去服裝布料市場和攤販老闆討價還價。玫瑰色的幻想破滅之後，如浴火重生般，她對生活的理解突然提升了一個境界：「我在路上塞車，接打無數電話，忽然想起以往睡到日上三竿拎著包逛街的慵懶時光，已經如此遙遠。當我真正直接面對生活的沉重、繁忙，反而活得更加充盈和開闊……以前的我總在尋找別人為自己營造的安全感，後來才明白誰也不能一直給你安全感，只有自己是自己最堅強的後盾。離開以前所認為的全世界，真正的全世界才會活生生地呈現在你眼前。」
除了你自己，沒有誰是你的全世界。
如果你認為一個人或者一個家是你的全世界，那我只能說，你的全世界有點小。
女人常犯的錯誤是，總以為自己可以躲在誰的身後享受歲月靜好，一回頭才發現，自己的雙腳已經站在懸崖邊。從喪失經濟獨立的那一刻開始，慢慢地，會接連喪失情感獨立、人格獨立，直到獨立性也全面淪陷，依賴心大增，不安全感爆棚。仰人鼻息的生活，終將令眼裡的疲憊無處可藏。
有位直男曾經頗為不屑地對我說：「男人喜歡開拓進取，女人喜歡不勞而獲。」
先不說這句話是不是過於偏激，相較於女人，男人確實很少有依附於他人的想法，他們早早地把自己定義為一枚過河卒子，不斷拚命向前，活得清醒、奮進。
西蒙．波娃說：「男人的極大幸運在於，他，不論在成年還是在小時候，必須踏上一條極為艱苦的道路，不過這又是一條最可靠的道路；女人的不幸則在於被幾乎不可抗拒的誘惑包圍著；她不是被要求奮發向上，而是聽說只要滑下去，就可以達到極樂的天堂。當她發覺自己被海市蜃樓愚弄時，已為時太晚；她的力量在失敗的冒險中已被耗盡。」
跟在別人身後走路，眼前只有別人的背影，只有自己用腳步丈量前路，一路披荊斬棘，升級打怪，才能看到更開闊的風景，這個過程固然漫長艱險，但也風光無限。
人生，路漫漫其修遠，獨立才是一條最可靠的路。
希望我們都能摒棄那些看起來很美的幻想，早早走上一條最可靠的路。

你花了大部分的時間做覺得會讓在乎的人開心的事，以為這樣就能被愛。然而過分討好別人，只會損耗自己的人生。
別人說我好，我才會覺得自己好。在意他人對自己的評價，對自己的行為總是小心翼翼，患得患失，最終被外界各種各樣的要求塑造成一個「盜版」的人，離真實的自己越來越遠。
在必須不斷抉擇的人生路口，每個選擇都決定了你的生活樣貌。你是一個用討好別人來獲得關注和愛的人，是一個用強勢氣場讓他人懼怕卻難以接近的人，還是一個在Instagram上過得像公主，私底下卻是灰姑娘的人？做真實的自己，不必唯唯諾諾、不必盛氣凌人，也不必裝模作樣，擁有淡淡的處世風格，照顧好自己的身心，幸福自會不期而至。

""The person you deserve to be good is yourself"": If someone is your world, then your world is a bit small
01 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Summary


What we want you to know is that women often make mistakes. They always think that they can hide behind them and enjoy the years. Only when they look back, they find that their feet are standing on the edge of the cliff. From the moment of loss of economic independence, slowly, emotional independence and personality independence will be lost one after another until independence is completely collapsed.



Text: Mi Xia
I have heard a word before: to be a woman is better than being a man, to enter and attack, to retreat.
This sentence makes people want to laugh: Retreat, where can you go back? Basically, from the moment you give up your efforts and give up independence, you have already planted hidden dangers.
There was a very special marriage in the entertainment industry. A famous music talent of 36 years old, likes a girl of seventeen. The girl married the genius at the age of 19 and gave birth to a daughter.
When talking about the age difference of 19, the talented person once said a very famous saying: ""She was very young when she was with me, and she has not even entered the society, so her basic world view is shaped by me. In contrast. Find a wife who is older and is shaped by people around the circle. You are going to change your wife. The latter is more tiring and more likely to have differences. My wife’s views on the world, even what music, what to watch. The movies are all influenced by me, so most of our ideas are very consistent. I think this is very happy.""
When everyone was applauding for this feeling and they were happy to see the words, I felt the back chill when I saw this passage. If a person is shaped into a doll filled with the thoughts of others, where is she herself? Isn’t this life completely self-defeating precarious?
Sure enough, six years later, the talented man proposed a divorce on the grounds that ""I feel unhappy with her life, I want more freedom and creative space."" One year after the divorce, looking back at the feelings at the time, the girl wrote on the social networking site: ""Everything is too late to prevent, I am suddenly thrown into the downpour rain from the fairy tale world, and I am soaked.""
She admitted that her and her daughter's greenhouse fortress had collapsed.
As the saying goes, the woman is weak, and the mother is just. After experiencing the pain of losing her marriage, she finally realized: ""Can't I give my daughter a better life based on her own ability? Why do I have to be a vassal of others?""
Fortunately, everything is not too late, she is only 25 years old. She found a partner, registered the company, started her own clothing brand, biting her teeth, doing her best, and re-opening the drums.
In the coldest season, she wrapped herself in a scorpion and went to the clothing fabric market to bargain with the vendor. After the disillusionment of the rose color, like the resurgence of the fire, her understanding of life suddenly raised a realm: ""I was on the road, picking up the phone, picking up countless calls, and suddenly remembered the lazy time of sleeping in the past. It’s been so far away. When I really face the heavy and busy life, I live more full and open... I used to look for the security that others created for myself, and later I realized that no one can always give you a sense of security. Only you are your strongest backing. Leaving the world you thought before, the real world will live in front of you.""
No one is your world except yourself.
If you think that a person or a family is your world, then I can only say that your world is a bit small.
The mistake that women often make is that they always think that they can hide behind them and enjoy the years. Only when they look back, they find that their feet are standing on the edge of the cliff. From the moment when economic independence is lost, slowly, emotional independence and personality independence will be lost, until independence is completely collapsed, dependence is greatly increased, and insecurity is bursting. The life of the human breath will eventually make the exhaustion in the eyes nowhere to hide.
A straight man once said to me quite disdainfully: ""Men like to forge ahead, and women like to get something for nothing.""
Let’s not say that this sentence is too extreme. Compared with women, men really have little idea of being attached to others. They define themselves as a pawn, and they are constantly moving forward and living soberly. Endeavor.
Simon. Pova said: ""The great fortune of a man is that he must embark on an extremely difficult road, whether in adulthood or in his childhood, but this is the most reliable road; the misfortune of women lies in the almost irresistible temptation. Surrounded by; she is not asked to work hard, but I heard that as long as I slide down, I can reach the paradise of bliss. When she finds herself fooled by the mirage, it is too late; her strength has been in the adventure of failure. Exhausted.""
Walking behind others, only the backs of others are in front of you. Only you can measure the road ahead with your footsteps. You can see the more open landscapes by upgrading the monsters. This process is long and difficult, but it is also infinite.
In life, the road is long and the road is long, and independence is the most reliable road.
I hope that we can all abandon those illusions that look beautiful and go to the most reliable road early.

You spend most of your time doing things that make people who care about happy, thinking that you can be loved. However, over-praising others will only deplete your life.
When others say that I am good, I will feel good about myself. I care about other people's evaluation of myself, always be cautious about their own behavior, suffer from loss, and eventually become a ""pirated"" person by various external demands, farther and farther away from the real self.
At the intersection of life that must be constantly chosen, each choice determines the look of your life. Are you a person who pleases others to get attention and love, is a person who is afraid of others but is inaccessible with a strong gas field, or a person who looks like a princess on Instagram and is a Cinderella in private? To be a true self, you don't have to be arrogant, you don't have to be arrogant, you don't have to pretend to be a model, you have a faint style of life, take care of your body and mind, and happiness will come unexpectedly.
