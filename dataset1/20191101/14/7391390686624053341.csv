The 10 Best Bralettes On Amazon

01 Nov 2019, 14:36

When it comes to wire-free comfort and style, many shoppers are devoted to the bralette for its versatility. Whether you’re lounging around the house, looking for zero seams under even the clingiest top, or creating a chic layered look, the best bralettes on Amazon have you covered. On my list below, I've even included a sport bralette that offers light-to-medium support and moisture-wicking properties, so you'll be comfortable and supported during workouts without feeling constricted.
While most bralettes tend to only offer minimal support, there are also styles that offer light padding or mesh cups so you still have that unfussy look but with a bit more support. If you have a larger bust or are looking for more support, look for features like fuller cups, an elastic band around the ribs, and wider shoulder straps to provide a more comfortable fit.
The bralettes on this list are made from fabrics like nylon, spandex, rayon, cotton, and elastane to provide stretch and breathability. Some of these bralettes are even machine-washable. And while some of these are all about casual cool, there are also styles that make a louder statement from cutouts to a leopard printed Savage x Fenty pick.
With all that in mind, these are the best bralettes on Amazon in a variety of styles, colors, and sizes. All of them are sure to add wireless comfort to your wardrobe.
1. A Comfy Classic Bralette In Lots Of Colors




Jockey Seamfree Bralette$24|AmazonSee On Amazon

This minimalist seamless bralette with adjustable straps is made from nylon and spandex for stretch and comfort, and it’s available in more than 10 colors. Choose from classics like white or beige, or go for a bright purple or blue. The cups include removable padding for more or less support. Best of all, it’s easy to machine-wash and can even be put in the dryer.
What fans say: ""I like this bra so much that this is the second order. It is so comfortable...hardly notice I’ve got it on.""


Available sizes: S - XL


2. A Classic Bralette For An Athleisure Look




Calvin Klein Modern Cotton Bralette$19|AmazonSee On Amazon

This iconic Calvin Klein bralette is a timeless choice for style and comfort. It’s made from a soft, breathable cotton-modal-elastane blend and features a racerback design and a thick elastic band with the Calvin Klein logo. There’s a wide array of colors and patterns to choose from including classic gray, black, or white, plus florals and stripes, and it’s machine-washable. However, while the look is sporty, reviewers report that it's more focused on comfort than support, so it's likely not the best choice for workouts.
What fans say: ""The material is UNBELIEVABLY soft, it feels like you aren’t wearing a bra at all.""

3. A Lacy Bralette With Lots Of Size Options

The only drawback to this Rihanna-approved style might be that it's hand-wash only.
What fans say: ""I wear a 42DD bra, so I had my doubts about this bralette … This one surprised me! There is not as much support as an actual bra, but I didn't feel like my boobs were just hanging there.""
