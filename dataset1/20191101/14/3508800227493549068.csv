《你最該討好的人是你自己》：你在一段關係裡渴望的是愛，還是「被認可」？
01 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是強撐著強大，以獲取認可的方式來索愛，終有一天會撐不住。人生很長，別對自己苦苦相逼。放鬆一點，以鬆弛和從容的態度來經營親密關係才是長久之計。



文：米夏
你要的不是愛，是被認可
太懂事的人，都活得辛苦，就像在薄冰上走路的人，永遠全身緊繃，走得戰戰兢兢。
一個女性朋友告訴我，她老公最近要被外派到美國工作兩年，臨走之前，老公跟她商量抓緊時間生個二寶，她也同意了，結果她剛剛懷孕兩個月，老公就坐飛機走了。
我問：「老公不在，你是辭職在家養胎，請個阿姨照顧，還是讓婆婆來幫忙？」
她故作輕鬆地說：「不用啊，我照常上班，快到預產期的時候讓他回來就行，婆婆在照顧外孫，走不開。」
我頗感不可思議，一個男人怎麼可以在這種時候提出生二胎？自己跑到大洋彼岸，讓老婆一個人承擔懷胎十月的辛苦的同時，不僅得照顧6歲的大寶，還得照常上班。
她說：「我也習慣了，以前，雖然老公在身邊，大兒子的事他也幾乎沒管過，孩子幼稚園在哪裡，上了幾個才藝班他都不知道。懷孕的時候，每次產檢我都是早早去醫院掛號，檢查完再去上班，有時候也想讓他陪我，但看他睡得那麼香也就不忍心叫醒他了。」
我無語。
我的這位女性朋友確實優秀，大家都公認她又漂亮又能幹，還會教孩子，但她畢竟是個女人，不是女超人。
雖然她獲得了全家上下的一致認可，但把一個孕婦一個人扔在家裡，貌似這家人有點不人道，對她缺了一點關愛和體貼。
英國哲學家培根（Francis Bacon）說：「如果你所愛的人不是同樣地愛著你，那麼就必然是在暗地裡輕蔑著你。」
這話冷酷吧？
可是，認可，不正是建立在愛的基礎上嗎？光說你好，卻不對你好，真的很難讓人相信這個人是愛你的，甚至會讓人覺得，他只是在利用你的傻，樂得自己享受清閒，你越辛勞一分，他的人生就越安逸一分。
有一次出差坐高鐵，鄰座的一個媽媽帶著兩個孩子出門，期間聊起天來，媽媽告訴我，她與丈夫開了一間店，做建材生意。
丈夫像個長不大的孩子，整天只知道坐在櫃檯後面玩手機遊戲，對生意一點也不用心。有時候顧客上門來買一個很小的配件，店裡沒貨，丈夫嫌麻煩，想直接把顧客打發走，她總是留下顧客的聯繫方式，然後一家家地打電話問供應商，甚至騎著車一家家地去找，盡量滿足顧客的需要。
有一次，一個中年人來買一種特殊型號的水龍頭，她費盡力氣終於找到樣品，連忙寄給顧客，沒想到這個顧客是個建築商，立刻下了一張大單，小店當年就盈利了。
丈夫說她天生帶財，運氣好，索性把生意完全交給她打理，自己每天就到處閒晃、打打牌，偶爾幫她跑跑腿、做做雜事。她說，他們那條街上的建材店，通常都是男主外，女主內，老闆出去跑業務，老闆娘在家裡看店，只有她，每天裡裡外外一肩挑。每次她埋怨老公無所作為，老公都會說：「不是每個人都像妳運氣那麼好，妳看我坐在店裡一天冷冷清清，妳一來人氣就旺得很，妳有好運氣，我有妳就行了！」
每次成一筆大單，老公都會對她特別好，端茶倒水把她當老佛爺般的伺候著，可每逢店裡生意冷清，老公對她就好像冷淡許多。所以，為了讓老公多心疼自己，也為了把日子過好，她只好加倍努力，不敢偷一點懶。
「女人啊，想要在家裡的地位高，還是得靠自己。」她感慨。
聽起來她好像是在抱怨，我卻聽出一絲驕傲和自豪的意味。
其實在我看來，所謂的天生帶財，不過是因為她態度熱情，服務周到，有耐心，能吃苦。
丈夫和婆家人對她的那些認可、誇讚，什麼旺夫啊，招財啊，賢慧啊，能幹啊，無非都是吊在兔子鼻子前的那根胡蘿蔔，吸引著她一直不辭辛苦地向前衝，拚命做！
如果一個人在自己的觀念中，將別人的認可當成愛，那他的人生不累才怪呢。
他會為了得到這份認可逼自己更強大、更優秀，變成無所不能的金剛，甚至會麻痺自己，忘記自己也是肉體凡胎，也有脆弱的一面，也有無力的時候，也需要別人的照顧和理解。
在親密關係中，有很多人常常傻傻分不清自己要的到底是愛，還是被認可。如果一個人童年時期在原生家庭裡，沒有得到充足且良好的愛，包括關注、認可、欣賞、讚美等，那麼這個人在成長過程中，內心深處就可能一直有一個空落落的洞，需要大量的愛來填滿。他們會偏執地認為，只有自己足夠完美、足夠優秀，別人才能認可自己，自己才能獲得愛。
在外人看來，這種活法未免用力過猛。他們一往情深又無怨無悔，毫不利己專門利人，愛上誰，就像一塊黏在身上的口香糖一樣不離不棄。
在潛意識中，他們對自己能否得到愛並沒有信心，甚至自己都無法肯定自己，懷疑自己不值得被愛。他們越是這樣想，就越是要證明自己可以擁有愛。因此，當別人給他們一個認可的時候，他們常常會誤認為那就是愛了，於是把自己的渴望和需求全部投射出去。自己稍微做得有些不盡如人意，又會擔憂失去別人的認可，愈發惴惴不安，愈發用力過猛。
在他們無盡的奉獻和付出中，別人常常也會無意識地被拉入這樣一種認知和交往模式中，對他們的強大產生依賴，對他們的付出視而不見。
說起來，他們並沒有錯，只是活得太「懂事」了。太懂事的人，都活得辛苦，就像在薄冰上走路的人，永遠全身緊繃，走得戰戰兢兢。要知道，真正的愛是沒有條件的。我們之所以被父母、家人、愛人愛著，是因為彼此之間有強大的感情連結，儘管我們有缺點、有不擅長之處，有很多做不好、做不到的事，但他們依然溫柔地愛著我們、守護我們，支持和幫助我們。
有一部電視劇叫《女不強大天不容》，先不講劇情如何，光是這個名字就看得我一愣一愣的。女人不強大，天都不容了？強大是女人必備的屬性嗎？是誰給我們套上這副枷鎖？
我一直覺得，女人最好的活法，就是認真生活，好好努力，盡力做最好的自己但不強求完美，承認自己的缺點，與不完美的自己和諧相處。強大的內心來源於自我肯定和自我接受，如果內心深處缺乏這份自信，就會以別人的看法為風向標，活得沒有方向。
強撐著強大，以獲取認可的方式來索愛，終有一天會撐不住。人生很長，別對自己苦苦相逼。放鬆一點，以鬆弛和從容的態度來經營親密關係才是長久之計。

你花了大部分的時間做覺得會讓在乎的人開心的事，以為這樣就能被愛。然而過分討好別人，只會損耗自己的人生。
別人說我好，我才會覺得自己好。在意他人對自己的評價，對自己的行為總是小心翼翼，患得患失，最終被外界各種各樣的要求塑造成一個「盜版」的人，離真實的自己越來越遠。
在必須不斷抉擇的人生路口，每個選擇都決定了你的生活樣貌。你是一個用討好別人來獲得關注和愛的人，是一個用強勢氣場讓他人懼怕卻難以接近的人，還是一個在Instagram上過得像公主，私底下卻是灰姑娘的人？做真實的自己，不必唯唯諾諾、不必盛氣凌人，也不必裝模作樣，擁有淡淡的處世風格，照顧好自己的身心，幸福自會不期而至。

""The person you deserve to be good is yourself"": Are you eager for love in a relationship or ""recognized""?
01 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Summary


What we want you to know is that you are strong and supportive, and you will not be able to support it one day. Life is very long, don't force yourself. Relaxing a little and running intimate relationships with a relaxed and calm attitude is a long-term solution.

What you want is not love, it is recognized
People who are too sensible have lived hard, just like those who walk on thin ice, always tightened and trembled.
A female friend told me that her husband had recently been sent to the United States for two years. Before leaving, her husband discussed with her to seize the time to have a second treasure. She also agreed. As a result, she had just been pregnant for two months and her husband was on the plane. gone.
I asked: ""My husband is not here. You are resigning to raise a baby at home. Please ask an aunt to take care of it, or let your mother-in-law come to help?""
She pretended to say easily: ""No, I go to work as usual, and let him come back when the due date is over. My mother-in-law is taking care of her grandson and can't walk away.""
I am quite unbelievable. How can a man propose a second child at this time? I ran to the other side of the ocean, let my wife bear the hard work of pregnant in October, not only have to take care of the 6-year-old Dabao, but also have to go to work as usual.
She said: ""I am used to it. In the past, although my husband was around, the eldest son had almost nothing to do with him. He was not aware of where the kindergarten was. He didn't know a few talent classes. When he was pregnant, every time he was pregnant. I went to the hospital early to register, went to work after checking, and sometimes wanted him to accompany me, but I couldn't bear to wake him up when he slept so well.""
I'm speechless.
My female friend is really good. Everyone recognizes that she is beautiful and capable. She also teaches children, but she is a woman after all, not a superwoman.
Although she was unanimously recognized by the whole family, it was a bit inhumane to leave a pregnant woman alone at home, and she lacked a little care and consideration for her.
The British philosopher Francis Bacon said: ""If the person you love does not love you the same, then you must be scorning you in the dark.""
Is this cold?
However, is recognition not based on love? It’s hard to say hello, but it’s not good for you. It’s really hard to believe that this person loves you. It even makes people feel that he is just using your stupidity. He is happy to enjoy himself. The harder you work, the more he The more comfortable life is.
I once took a high-speed train on a business trip. A mother from the neighbors took two children out. During the chat, my mother told me that she had opened a shop with her husband to do building materials business.
Husband is like a child who grows up. She only knows that she is sitting behind the counter and playing mobile games. She doesn't care about business. Sometimes customers come to buy a small accessory, the store is out of stock, the husband is too troublesome, want to send the customer directly, she always leaves the customer's contact information, then a family call to ask the supplier, even ride Go to the car and find a place to meet the needs of customers.
Once, a middle-aged man came to buy a special type of faucet. She tried her best to finally find the sample and sent it to the customer. I didn't expect the customer to be a builder. I immediately placed a big order, and the store was profitable that year.
The husband said that she was born with money, and she was lucky. She simply handed over the business to her. She swayed and played cards every day, occasionally helping her run errands and do chores. She said that the building materials shop on that street is usually a male main, the female main, the boss went out to run the business, the proprietress looked at the store at home, only her, picking up every day inside and outside. Every time she blames her husband for doing nothing, her husband will say: ""Not everyone is as good as luck. When I sit in the store, I am cold and clear, and when I come to the market, I am very popular. I have good luck. I have a good luck. Just fine!""
Every time she makes a big order, her husband will be especially good to her. She will serve her as Lafayette, but when her business is deserted, her husband seems to be a lot colder. Therefore, in order to let her husband feel more distressed, but also to make the day too good, she had to redouble her efforts, not dare to steal a little lazy.
""Women, if you want to be at home, you still have to rely on yourself."" She was emotional.
It sounds like she is complaining, but I hear a hint of pride and pride.
In fact, in my opinion, the so-called natural wealth, but because of her enthusiasm, courteous service, patience, can endure hardship.
Husband and her family's recognition and praise for her, what Wangfu, lucky, wise, capable, nothing more than the carrot hanging in front of the rabbit's nose, attracting her has been rushing forward, Do it desperately!
If a person is in his own ideas and regards the recognition of others as love, then his life is not tired.
In order to get this recognition, he will become stronger and better, become a omnipotent King Kong, and even paralyze himself. He forgets that he is also a fleshy child, a fragile side, and when he is powerless, he also needs the care of others. understanding.
In intimate relationships, many people are often stupid to know whether they want love or whether they are recognized. If a person has not received sufficient and good love in his native family during his childhood, including attention, recognition, appreciation, praise, etc., then in the process of growing up, there may always be an empty hole in the depths of the person, which requires a large number of Love to fill up. They will be paranoid that only if they are perfect enough and good enough, others can recognize themselves and they can get love.
In the eyes of outsiders, this kind of living method is too hard to use. They have a deep affection and no regrets, no disadvantages to others, and whoever falls in love is like a piece of chewing gum sticking to the body.
In the subconscious, they have no confidence in whether they can get love, or even they can't be sure of themselves, and they suspect that they are not worthy of being loved. The more they think about it, the more they have to prove that they can have love. Therefore, when others give them a recognition, they often mistakenly believe that it is love, so they project their cravings and needs. I have done something a little bit unsatisfactory, and I am worried that I will lose the recognition of others. I am more and more uneasy and I am getting too hard.
In their endless dedication and dedication, others are often unconsciously drawn into such a pattern of cognition and communication, relying on their power and turning a blind eye to their efforts.
Speaking of it, they are not wrong, just living too ""sensible"". People who are too sensible have lived hard, just like those who walk on thin ice, always tightened and trembled. Be aware that true love is unconditional. The reason why we are loved by our parents, family, and loved ones is because we have strong emotional connections. Although we have shortcomings, some are not good at it, and there are many things that we can’t do or can’t do, they are still gentle. Love us, protect us, support and help us.
There is a TV series called ""The woman is not strong and the day is not tolerable"". I don't want to talk about the plot first. Just because of this name, I can see it one by one. Women are not strong, the day is not allowed? Is power a must-have attribute for women? Who gave us this shackle?
I have always felt that the best way for women to live is to live a serious life, work hard, do their best to do the best, but not to be perfect, to admit their shortcomings, to live in harmony with the imperfect self. A strong heart comes from self-affirmation and self-acceptance. If there is a lack of self-confidence in the heart, it will be based on the views of others and live without direction.
Strong support, to get approval, the way to love, one day will not hold. Life is very long, don't force yourself. Relaxing a little and running intimate relationships with a relaxed and calm attitude is a long-term solution.

You spend most of your time doing things that make people who care about happy, thinking that you can be loved. However, over-praising others will only deplete your life.
When others say that I am good, I will feel good about myself. I care about other people's evaluation of myself, always be cautious about their own behavior, suffer from loss, and eventually become a ""pirated"" person by various external demands, farther and farther away from the real self.
At the intersection of life that must be constantly chosen, each choice determines the look of your life. Are you a person who pleases others to get attention and love, is a person who is afraid of others but is inaccessible with a strong gas field, or a person who looks like a princess on Instagram and is a Cinderella in private? To be a true self, you don't have to be arrogant, you don't have to be arrogant, you don't have to pretend to be a model, you have a faint style of life, take care of your body and mind, and happiness will come unexpectedly.
