Maritime accidents monthly report October 2019
01 Nov 2019, 14:44 by Mikhail Voytenko

SUMMARY

Notice: Principal idea and character of MB Daily is somewhat similar to Ambulance Emergency Service – MB priority is to find out about maritime accidents, involving merchant marine ships, ASAP. MB monitors only some major accidents in their development and outcome, i.e. further development of most part of reported accidents isn’t monitored.
A number of accidents though known to MB, aren’t included – like trivial accidents with ferries, or NUC problems which were fixed by crew and didn’t require towage. Fishery is, generally, monitored, but only major accidents are reported.
