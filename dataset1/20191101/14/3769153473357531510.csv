Hi, I would like to share with you my new tutorial about the Grease Pencil. This tutorial was made for 2D animators and storyboard artists who wants to use grease pencil in Blender as their main tool. It can be followed by non-blender users as I cover the basics again. It covers many techniques such as navigation using a tabel, basic objects manipulation, drawing tools, stroke editing, layers, onion skin, animation, modifiers, VSE scene editing and more... This is my first tutorial in english so I hope it will be clear enough ! Happy Blending !
