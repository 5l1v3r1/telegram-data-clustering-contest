《原生家庭療法》：感情關係中被要求改變時，這四種策略是最常見的反應
01 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是這些反應不會脫離「改變」的背景獨自發生，沒有人是所謂的「好人」或「壞人」，大家都只是想要應對差異所帶來的焦慮，以及處理家庭中對親疏需求的威脅。



文：羅納德．理查森（Ronald W. Richardson）
對一致性的強烈要求（節錄）
誠如前面提過的，在感情關係中，如果有一方因兩人的差異而感到焦慮，他／她通常會試圖改變對方；貝塔試著讓史蒂芬變得跟她一樣，成為健談的人，而史蒂芬則試著讓貝塔變得像他一樣獨來獨往，兩人的關係會因為在異中求同而產生許多壓力。然而，改變別人並不容易，親身試過、有五十年經驗的夫妻也會這樣告訴你。被要求（命令）改變的那一方通常會有以下四種反應，他們可能會：

順從
叛逆
攻擊
斷離

我們會在下面的敘述中詳細討論這四種反應，你可能已經認出家人曾使用以上策略裡的一種或全部，甚至你自己也有過上述的反應。大部分人會同時採用這四種反應，也有人會看情況選擇，不過每個人通常都會有一種最喜歡的應對模式。
不管你是要求對方改變，還是那個必須有所改變的人，最重要的是了解：當改變的要求出現時，這四種策略是最常見的反應方式。這些反應不會脫離「改變」的背景獨自發生，沒有人是所謂的「好人」或「壞人」，大家都只是想要應對差異所帶來的焦慮，以及處理家庭中對親疏需求的威脅。在針對這些策略的討論中，我們的重點會放在配偶身上，不過同樣的情況也會發生在其他人際關係中，無論是親密交往或隨意的（性）關係都適用。
1.「親愛的，我只要你想要的」──順從者
面對相同要求的時候，順從者應對的方式就是假裝兩人之間沒有差別。這在婚姻中最常見，夫妻對外槍口一致，就連親生孩子都不知道父母內心真正的感受為何。
他們避免衝突，因為衝突會凸顯兩人的差異，夫妻團結才是理想境界。這種人可能或多或少會意識到自己需要空間，以及與對方的不同點，可是，他們又認為這種需求是錯的，而且會摧毀感情，於是選擇忽視。
這種夫妻表面上看起來婚姻美滿，因為他們從不吵架。然而，順從者會找出其他方式來表現自己的立場，像是妻子一上床就說頭痛以避免和丈夫親熱的老戲碼，就是順從型妻子發揮力量，堅定個人立場的例子；這麼一來，妻子可以對自己和丈夫否認兩人之間有衝突，同時又能假藉身體不適來保持距離。
案例阿曼達和亞伯帶十六歲的女兒波莉去看心理治療師，他們向治療師表示波莉有性濫交的問題。阿曼達和亞伯否認婚姻有問題，還說兩人在一起非常開心。當治療師問起他們是怎麼跟波莉談論性和性慾這一類的話題，他們的回答是：除了說過性禁忌之外，從來沒有和波莉討論過性的問題；當治療師問起他們怎麼跟彼此討論性事，阿曼達和亞伯承認兩人其實不會討論，事實上他們已經很久沒有親熱了。阿曼達表示自己從來沒有享受過性愛，亞伯說自己從阿曼達的表現看出了這一點，所以不再向她求歡，甚至也不跟她討論這類事情。亞伯順從了阿曼達的意願，他們倆對性的焦慮轉移到女兒身上，波莉的症狀點出了阿曼達與亞伯的婚姻問題。
無論具體模式為何，順從者的基本需求就是「不惜一切代價保持和平」，他們害怕衝突，尤其是衝突之後可能導致兩人分離。這麼看來好像只有一方在避免衝突，但其實雙方都不希望起衝突，於是兩人不知不覺地採取這種手段對應焦慮感。兩人都沒有充分探究對方對某個議題的信仰、原則、看法和感受，取而代之的是忽略彼此的差異性，結果從未真正了解對方與自己；他們一直沒有意識到兩人的差異具有帶來問題解決之道的優勢。
記住，順從者不全然是弱勢無力的一方，看似軟落無力的弱勢者也能擁有許多力量，他們時常表現出犧牲自己成全別人的樣子，然後說：「不用管我啦！你就去做你想做的事情就好。」
這種弱勢者有能力讓他人感到愧疚，而且也很會利用這一點。感情中所謂的「弱者」，通常都會獲得一定的「交換補償」（trade-offs）。弱勢者會在不知不覺中認定：「好吧，我願意讓步，在這件、這件和這件事上妥協，但下次你最好聽我的。」如果對方下一次沒有妥協，弱勢者就會冒著起衝突的風險，大喊：「我為你做了這件和這件事，結果你卻連那件事也不願意替我做！」就算弱勢者這次的手段沒有奏效，他／她還是成功地為下一次增加了對方的罪惡感。
順從者應對缺乏親密感的方式之一，就是積極投入婚姻之外的人際關係。例如，熱心參加教會或社區活動、付出心力照顧老邁的父母、積極培養興趣或全心投入工作。許多身為順從者的母親會過於干涉子女的生活，這通常對母親和孩子都會造成傷害；父母如果以順從方式對待彼此，這樣的孩子大多在將來難以負責自己的一切，因為父母太過投入在孩子身上，一手包辦孩子自己該做的所有事情。父母專注於孩子的一舉一動，可以避免面對和處理兩人之間的差異，以及對親密／疏離的需求。
順從者經常是精神或身體不太健康的一方，他們應對伴侶間差異的掙扎，可能會藉由以下症狀表現出來：頭痛或背痛、輕度憂鬱、酗酒、頻繁失業、罹癌、心臟疾病或嚴重情緒障礙（需進入專業機構接受治療）等。
案例羅貝多曾經酗酒八年。神智清醒的時候，他在婚姻關係裡無法為自己辯護；因為羅貝多的母親極具權威，而他順從妻子就像小時候順從母親那樣。可是只要他一喝醉，情況就完全變了樣；他變得怒氣沖沖，還會對家人口出穢言——羅貝多的家人都知道他在清醒時絕對不可能說出這些話。當羅貝多漸漸學會在婚姻中替自己開口後，他變得更堅定、更有自信，而且酗酒次數也大幅減少。
問題

在你的原生家庭中，誰是順從者？這位順從的成員在哪些不明顯的方面具有強大力量？他／她以順從方式應對而獲得的補償又有哪些？
現在的你會在什麼情況下選擇順從，不願意公開承認自己和某人之間的不同呢？

當然，現在你應該已經猜到了，順從者不只會以生病來表現及解決自身的焦慮，他們的另一半也有同等程度的焦慮感，順從者的「生病」變成了焦點，吸引雙方的注意，藉此忽略兩人對差異的所有憂慮，並使家庭關係保持平衡；如果生病的一方已經康復，他們也會找出其他方式避免面對兩人的差異。
2. 「我行我素」──叛逆者
叛逆者表面上看起來很需要保持距離和獨立性，但那是因為真正全然獨立太嚇人，所以他們還是與人保持夠近的距離，然後表現反叛行為。當A叫B這麼做時，B卻選擇那麼做，就算B聽A的話結果會比較好，B還是會選擇用自己的方式行事。
叛逆者從來學不會到底該怎麼做，才能保障自己的「與眾不同」。叛逆者太過投入反向行事──不照他人的要求做事、不按牌理出牌，結果反而沒辦法決定自己真正想要的是什麼。叛逆者太忙著抵制別人設定的目標，結果反而沒辦法為自己設立目標；對叛逆者來說，獨立的意思就是做和他人期待相反的事。然而，就算這麼做了，叛逆者實際上仍然受控於他人，真正發號施令的還是對方，叛逆者不過就是反向操作而已。
當然，要成為成功的叛逆者，就要有可以反抗的對象。大部分的叛逆者都能輕易找到愛提供意見的「權威人物」，這些人永遠都是對的：「就那樣做，不然你絕對會後悔／受傷／考試不及格／被解僱／發生意外。」這樣一來，當權威人物預言的壞事發生時，權威人物就可以說：「我早就跟你說了，你根本就應該聽我的（或學我那麼做）。」
不過接下來，權威人物通常會介入收拾殘局，不管發生了什麼災難，他們都會替叛逆者承擔責任，因此叛逆者很少承受自己的行為所帶來的後果，因為身邊總是有人幫忙他脫困。
如果家中有同性別的孩子，叛逆者通常都是次子或次女，他們在家中花很多時間、費盡心思要表現出自己與長子或長女的不同，他們要靠自己獲得家人的接受和認可。一般而言，叛逆者的兄弟姊妹往往更循規蹈矩而受到家人認同，身為叛逆者的次子或次女，通常會和另一家的長子或長女結婚，藉此繼續反抗權威；過去負責照顧弟妹的另一半，現在則很樂意用權威管理身為叛逆者的配偶。
一方具有權威，永遠都試著證明自己是對的，另一方則扮演叛逆者的角色，從來都不用為自己的行為負責，某些夫妻可以長期維持這樣的關係。
案例蘇琳是家中的次女，嫁給了身為長男的尼可拉斯。蘇琳習慣依賴，而尼可拉斯願意做主，兩人在許多方面都合得來。可是，蘇琳不喜歡「依附別人」這樣的形象，於是她變得有點「女權主義」，總談論著男人怎麼樣限制女人。然而，她從來沒有採取任何替自己做決定的行動，雖然抱怨尼可拉斯老是替她做主，但她也一直照做。後來，尼可拉斯因為心臟病發作去世，沒有了他，蘇琳竟然不知該怎麼生活。一直以來，尼可拉斯都被蘇琳用來掩飾自己內心的恐懼，其實她一直害怕成為獨立自主的人。蘇琳的反叛只是表面而已。
問題

在你的原生家庭裡，誰是叛逆的那一個？其他人對此如何反應？
在你目前的生活中，表現叛逆的人又是誰？你是屬於權威的一方，還是反抗權威的那一方呢？如果沒有「權威者」和「叛逆者」的對抗，你的生活又會怎麼樣？

與原生家庭和解，才能創造自己想要的人生。

我很愛我的伴侶，就算各自的原生家庭習慣不同，也應該要互相包容、忍受。
你和你的家人如何處理意見分歧？大吵、冷戰？還是雙方坐下來討論？
當你和父母意見衝突時，你會否定自我情緒、滿足父母期望；還是刻意唱反調？

婚姻、親子、工作、友誼……成年後許多的人際關係問題，其實都可以回溯至我們在原生家庭中的經驗，原因在於──大部分的人都沒有學習過在和重要的人親近時，怎樣才能夠繼續做自己。
每個家庭裡都有三角關係：父母、子女（或兄弟姊妹）、其他親戚的各種三角組合，每個家庭裡都有受害者、迫害者、拯救者的角色，也存在著功能過度者與功能不足者，這些角色隨時都在輪替，你是如此，你的父母亦如此……
舉例來說，你始終發誓絕對不會做父母曾經做過的某些事，結果你可能還是去做了那之中的許多事，而你的父母可能也是這樣……
你在家中排行第幾？你有兄弟姊妹嗎？或是獨生子／女？你的伴侶在原生家庭中又是排行第幾？有么妹的長子通常與有兄長的么女最合拍，有弟妹的長女跟獨子或有姊姊的么子最麻吉，可是當長女遇上長男，極有可能隨時上演家庭權力爭奪戰……

透過原生家庭療法，讓你與他人維持親密關係的同時，又能追尋自己想要的東西。

對於每個人來說，在原生家庭的生活是極為強大的體驗，這種經歷會影響的不只有童年；還有我們看待自己的方式、我們看待他人的方式，以及我們看待世界的方式，全都經由原生家庭的背景塑型而成，在原生家庭中發展的觀點會伴隨著我們一生。
人生中最困難的事情之一，就是讓情感從早期家庭環境中分離出來。有一種方法可以處理這種原生家庭力量，那就是原生家庭和解（Family of origin work）。

「原生家庭和解」總共有七個步驟：

第一步──家族譜系：你的家裡有誰？（畫出你的家系圖）第二步──媽，妳好，還記得我嗎？（聯絡家庭成員）第三步──創建家族史（建立涵蓋三代的家族編年史）第四步──筆記本在手，隨時記下想問與探究的問題（調查研究）第五步──你可以再一次回家（探訪家人）第六步──不管你喜不喜歡，這就是我（分化）第七步──再來一次（學會了接納自己與他人）
這套療法能改變你在原生家庭中對自我的體驗，並延伸到目前的人際關係。藉著學習以新方式對待過去的「殘餘物」，讓你開始過更好的生活。如果你能用原生家庭的環境，看待過去「未了」的事情，你就能變得更為正面積極，也更能夠掌握自己的人生，不會被討厭的事件擊倒，並且能創造出自己想要的人生。

""Native Home Therapy"": These four strategies are the most common reactions when asked to change in relationships.
01 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Summary


What we want you to know is that these reactions will not happen independently from the background of ""change"". No one is a so-called ""good guy"" or ""bad guy"". Everyone just wants to cope with the anxiety caused by the difference and deal with the family. The threat to the need for pro-sparing.



Text: Ronald. Ronald W. Richardson
Strong requirements for consistency (excerpts)
As mentioned earlier, in a relationship, if one party feels anxious about the difference between the two, he/she usually tries to change each other; Beta tries to make Stephen become like a talker, and Stephen tried to make Beta become as independent as he is, and the relationship between the two would create a lot of pressure because of the homosexuality. However, it is not easy to change others. Couples who have tried it for 50 years will tell you this. The party that is required to change (command) usually has the following four reactions, they may:

obedience
Rebellious
attack
Break off

We will discuss these four reactions in detail in the following narrative. You may have recognized that your family has used one or all of the above strategies, and even you have had the above reactions. Most people will use these four reactions at the same time, and some will look at the situation, but everyone usually has a favorite coping style.
Whether you ask the other person to change, or the person who must change, the most important thing is to understand that these four strategies are the most common response when change requirements arise. These reactions do not happen independently from the background of ""change"". No one is a so-called ""good guy"" or ""bad guy"". Everyone just wants to cope with the anxiety caused by the difference and to deal with the threat to the family's demand for the family. In the discussion of these strategies, our focus will be on the spouse, but the same situation will occur in other relationships, whether intimate or casual (sexual) relationships apply.
1. ""Dear, I only want what you want"" - Obedient
In the face of the same requirements, the way the followers respond is to pretend that there is no difference between the two. This is most common in marriages. Couples are consistent in their guns, and even their own children do not know what their parents really feel.
They avoid conflicts, because conflicts will highlight the differences between the two, and unity between husband and wife is the ideal state. Such people may be more or less aware of the need for space and the difference between them, but they also think that this demand is wrong, and will destroy the feelings, so choose to ignore.
Such couples seem to have a happy marriage because they never quarrel. However, the followers will find other ways to express their position, such as the old drama that the wife said that she has a headache to avoid being intimate with her husband, that is, the example of a submissive wife who exerts strength and strengthens her personal position; thus, the wife You can deny yourself and your husband that there is a conflict between the two, and at the same time, you can maintain your distance by using physical discomfort.
Cases Amanda and Abel took their 16-year-old daughter, Polly, to see a psychotherapist who told the therapist that Polly had sexual promiscuity. Amanda and Abel denied that there was a problem with marriage and said that they were very happy together. When the therapists asked how they talked about Polly about sex and sexuality, their answer was: In addition to speaking about sexual taboos, they never discussed sexual issues with Polly; when the therapist asked them How to discuss sex with each other, Amanda and Abel admitted that the two would not actually discuss, in fact they have not been intimate for a long time. Amanda said that she has never enjoyed sex. Abel said that she saw this from Amanda's performance, so she no longer asked her for her, nor even discussed such things with her. Abel obeyed Amanda's wishes, and their sexual anxiety shifted to her daughter. Polly's symptoms point out the marriage problem between Amanda and Abel.
Regardless of the specific model, the basic need of the followers is to ""keep peace at all costs."" They are afraid of conflicts, especially after the conflict may lead to separation. It seems that only one party is avoiding conflicts, but in fact, neither side wants to have a conflict, so the two unconsciously adopt this method to respond to anxiety. Neither of them fully explored their beliefs, principles, opinions and feelings about an issue. Instead, they ignored each other's differences and never really understood each other and themselves. They never realized that the difference between the two had brought The advantage of solving the problem.
Remember, the obedient is not a weak and weak side. The seemingly weak and vulnerable can also have a lot of power. They often show the way they sacrifice themselves to fulfill others. Then they say, ""Don't worry about me! You go. Just do what you want to do.""
This kind of vulnerable person has the ability to make others feel embarrassed, and will also take advantage of this. The so-called ""weak"" in the relationship usually gets a certain ""trade-offs"". The weak will unknowingly say: ""Well, I am willing to give in, compromise on this, this and this matter, but next time you better listen to me."" If the other party does not compromise next time, the weak The person will risk the conflict and shout: ""I did this and you for this, but you didn't even want to do it for me!"" Even if the weaker did not work this way, He/she has succeeded in increasing the guilt of the other party for the next time.
One of the ways in which a compliance person responds to a lack of intimacy is to actively engage in relationships outside of marriage. For example, enthusiasm for church or community activities, dedication to care for old parents, active interest or commitment to work. Many mothers who are obedient will interfere too much with their children's lives. This usually hurts both mothers and children. If parents treat each other in a compliance manner, most of these children will be unable to take care of themselves in the future because their parents are too invested. On the child, all the things the child should do. Parents focus on the child's every move, avoiding the need to face and deal with the differences between the two, as well as the need for intimacy / alienation.
Obedients are often mentally or physically unhealthy. Their struggle for differences between partners may be manifested by symptoms such as headache or back pain, mild depression, alcoholism, frequent unemployment, cancer, heart disease or Severe emotional disorder (need to enter a professional institution for treatment).
Case Robedo has been drinking for eight years. When the mind is clear, he can't defend himself in the marriage relationship; because Roberto's mother is very authoritative, and his obedience to his wife is like obeying his mother when he was a child. But as soon as he was drunk, the situation changed completely; he became angry and rumors about his family - Robedo's family knew that he was absolutely impossible to say when he was awake. When Roberto gradually learned to speak for himself in marriage, he became more determined and confident, and the number of alcohol abuses was greatly reduced.
problem

Who is obedient in your native family? What obedient members of this obedient have powerful powers? What are the compensations he/she has received in response to obedience?
Under what circumstances do you choose to obey and are not willing to publicly admit the difference between yourself and someone?

Of course, now you should have guessed that the obedient will not only manifest and solve their own anxiety by ill, but the other half will have the same degree of anxiety. The obedient's ""illness"" becomes the focus, attracting the attention of both parties. This ignores all the worries of the two and makes the family relationship balanced; if the sick side has recovered, they will find other ways to avoid the difference between the two.
2. ""I am doing my own thing"" - the traitor
Rebels seem to need to maintain distance and independence on the surface, but that is because the total independence is too scary, so they are still close enough to people and then show rebellious behavior. When A calls B to do this, B chooses to do so. Even if B listens to A, the result will be better, and B will choose to act in his own way.
Rebels never learn what to do in order to protect themselves from being different. The renegade is too ruined to act in the opposite direction - not doing things according to the requirements of others, not playing cards, but the result is that there is no way to decide what they really want. Rebels are too busy to resist the goals set by others, but instead have no way to set goals for themselves; for the rebels, independence means doing the opposite of what others expect. However, even if this is done, the traitor is actually still controlled by others, and the real dictator is the other party, and the traitor is just the reverse operation.
Of course, to be a successful traitor, there must be objects that can resist. Most of the traitors can easily find the ""authoritative figures"" who love to give advice. These people are always right: ""If you do that, you will definitely regret / hurt / fail the exam / be fired / accident."" In this way, when the bad things predicted by the authority figures happen, the authority figure can say: ""I have told you that you should listen to me (or learn to do that).""
But then, the authority figures usually get involved in cleaning up the mess, no matter what the disaster, they will take responsibility for the rebel, so the traitor rarely suffers the consequences of his actions, because there are always people around him to help him out.
If there are children of the same sex at home, the traitors are usually second or second daughters. They spend a lot of time at home and try their best to show that they are different from their eldest son or eldest daughter. They have to accept and accept their family members. In general, the brothers and sisters of the renegade are often more disciplined and recognized by the family. The second or second daughter of the traitor usually marries another eldest or eldest daughter to continue to resist the authority; in the past, the other responsible for taking care of the younger siblings Half, now I am happy to use authority to manage the spouse who is a traitor.
One party has authority, always tries to prove that it is right, and the other plays the role of a traitor, and never has to be responsible for its own actions. Some couples can maintain such a relationship for a long time.
Case Su Lin is the second daughter in the family, married to Nikolas as a long man. Su Lin is used to relying on it, and Nicholas is willing to be the master. The two are in many ways. However, Su Lin did not like the image of ""attaching others"", so she became a bit ""feminist"" and always talked about how men limit women. However, she has never taken any action to make decisions for herself. Although she complains that Nikolas is always the master of her, she has always done it. Later, Nicholas died of a heart attack, without him, Su Lin did not know how to live. Nicholas has always been used by Su Lin to conceal her inner fears. In fact, she has always been afraid to become an independent person. Su Lin’s rebellion is only superficial.
problem

Who is the rebellious one in your native family? How do others react to this?
Who is the person who shows rebellion in your current life? Are you an authoritative party or a party that resists authority? If there is no confrontation between ""authority"" and ""rebel"", what will happen to your life?

Reconciliation with the original family can create the life you want.

I love my partner very much. Even if my native family has different habits, I should be tolerant and tolerant.
How do you and your family deal with differences of opinion? Big noisy, cold war? Or are the two sides sitting down to discuss?
When you are in conflict with your parents, do you deny your emotions, meet your parents' expectations, or deliberately sing the opposite?

Marriage, parenting, work, friendship... Many interpersonal problems in adulthood can actually be traced back to our experience in the native family, because most people have never learned to be close to important people. How can I continue to be myself.
Each family has a triangular relationship: a triangular combination of parents, children (or brothers and sisters), and other relatives. Each family has the role of victim, persecutor, and savior. There are also over-functioning people and functions. Insufficient, these characters are always on the rotation, you are so, your parents are like this...
For example, you always swear that you will never do something that your parents have done, and you may still be doing a lot of things, and your parents may be like that...
How many are you at home? Do you have brothers and sisters? Or an only child/female? What is your partner's ranking in the original family? The eldest son of a sister is usually the best match with a woman who has a brother. The eldest daughter of a younger brother and the only son or a sly son is the most arrogant, but when the eldest daughter meets a long man, it is very likely that there will be a battle for family power at any time...

Through native family therapy, you can maintain a close relationship with others while pursuing what you want.

For everyone, life in a native family is an extremely powerful experience that affects not only childhood; the way we look at ourselves, the way we look at others, and the way we look at the world, all through The background of the original family is shaped, and the development of the original family will be with us for the rest of our lives.
One of the most difficult things in life is to separate emotions from the early family environment. There is a way to deal with this kind of native family power, which is the Family of origin work.

There are seven steps in the ""Native Family Reconciliation"":

The first step - family pedigree: Who is in your family? (Draw your family diagram) The second step - Mom, oh, remember me? (Contact Family Members) Step 3 - Create a Family History (Building a Family Chronicle Covering Three Generations) Step 4 - Notebook in hand, keep down the questions you want to ask and explore (investigation) Step 5 - You can Going home again (visiting the family) Step 6 - Whether you like it or not, this is the seventh step of my (differentiation) - come again (learn to accept yourself and others)
This set of treatments can change your experience of self in your native family and extend to your current relationships. By learning to treat the past ""residues"" in a new way, let you start a better life. If you can use the environment of a native family and look at the past ""unfinished"" things, you will become more positive and more capable of mastering your own life, not being knocked down by annoying events, and being able to create yourself. The life you want.
