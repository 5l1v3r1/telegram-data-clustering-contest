Kim Kardashian and Her Kids North, Saint, and Chicago Pulled Off the Best Flintstones Halloween Costume
01 Nov 2019, 14:37 by Alyssa Bailey
Kim Kardashian debuted her own solo Elle Woods costume yesterday, which was impressive. But Kardashian outdid herself with her family costume: She dressed up with her children North, Saint, and Chicago as characters from The Flintstones. Kardashian first unveiled the four's look, then two bonus photos featuring Kardashian's husband Kanye West as Dino and baby Psalm as Bamm-Bamm.



Kim was Betty Rubble, North was Wilma Flintstone, Chicago was Pebbles Flintstone, and Saint was Fred Flintstone. Barney Rubble was MIA.









That was not North's only costume: She was also a devil when she went trick-or-treating yesterday. Her mother also teased a second costume for Halloween night and Kendall Jenner's birthday party. Kardashian didn't share the full look yet, but the teaser was very glitzy, dragon-like, and elaborate.

While West may not be a fan of North West wearing makeup for the group Halloween costume, People spoke to a source this week who assured the outlet that all is well with Kimye, and Kardashian respects her husband's beliefs.
“Kim and Kanye are in such a great place right now,” the source said. “Kim doesn’t want to change Kanye. She loves him and supports him.” (West made headlines this week for his controversial ultra-conservative comments about Plan B, Democrats ""brainwashing"" black Americans and ""making us abort our children""...and also his lack of understanding that Plan B is not an abortion pill, it's an emergency contraceptive.)
Kardashian doesn't agree with everything and can't predict some of the stuff her husband will say, but their marriage is okay, People's source said: “Of course, there are going to be times when Kanye says something Kim didn’t know he was going to say, but in general they talk about everything and are usually on the same page.""
A source told People yesterday that actually, there's some stuff that Kardashian wishes West would reconsider his extreme stance on. “Kim always was and continues to be supportive of Kanye. But there are definitely subjects that she wishes that he wasn’t so opinionated about,” the source said.
“She is also aware that when you’re a passionate person, sometimes during interviews you say more than you originally wanted to,” the source added. “This is why she never lectures him about comments. [She] likes that Kanye is truthful and speaks his mind.”
