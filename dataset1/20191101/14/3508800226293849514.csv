01 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是風雨生信心，獲得寶貴造血幹細胞移植機會的阿力斯，受贈康復後，不但活得很健康，人生觀也變得更豁達。「不確定這是不是捐贈者對我的改變，還是這場病讓我更懂得珍惜生命。」

南非來的最敬禮
「黑黃配對我來說是奇蹟，我真的很感激每一位協助我重生的人；能夠在台灣配對又移植成功，說明人類是沒有種族、大小、年紀差別的。在地球上，我們原本就是一家人。」來自南非的印度裔受贈者阿力斯（Amrith Prithrajsing） ，由衷說出他的真實心情。
從南非約翰尼斯堡來到花蓮，整整花了三十六個小時，四十五歲的阿力斯臉上卻沒有絲毫倦容。他的太太就坐在身旁，兩人都是印度裔，有著深遂的雙眸、咖啡色的皮膚。談起從生病到重生的過程，儘管表情始終平靜，但內心澎湃的情緒，卻從言談中一點一點流露出來……
為什麼是我？太太和孩子怎麼辦？
二○○三年，他發現身上出現瘀青，儘管內心起疑，但也很快找個理由讓自己心安，「大概在哪裡撞到吧！」不久，在銀行上班的太太，剛好排定身體健康檢查，陪同的阿力斯隨口問醫師，有關身上瘀青的事。
「先抽血看看。」醫師說。當天晚上檢查報告出爐，醫師告知他罹患了「CML，慢性骨髓性白血病」。「什麼是CML？」在完全不知道這是什麼疾病的情況下，整個家族就已陷入恐慌。他本人更震驚，完全不能接受，不斷想著「為什麼是我？為什麼偏偏是我？」
當時阿力斯三十五歲，太太小他一歲，無論工作、家庭都很平順，還有兩個小孩，一個九歲，一個五歲。「太太和孩子怎麼辦？」他幾次緊閉著雙眼問蒼天，心痛到淚流滿面。
大約有兩週時間，他整個人像失了魂魄似的，彷彿在茫茫大海上漂流。有一天，他想起去世的爸爸，想起自己在十一歲那年的孤單、無助。當爸爸和兩個孩子的身影相互交疊時，阿力斯一下子清醒過來——他決定不讓往事重演。
「治療吧！」他告訴太太。
兩度配對，不知名的台灣給他希望
化療的副作用讓他吃盡苦頭，身體虛弱得連說話的力氣也沒有，有時還會持續幾天的高燒，加上口腔潰爛導致無法進食。九個月後，原本八十八公斤的他，瘦到只剩四十五公斤，被病魔折磨得不成人形。不得已，他決定放棄化療，轉而尋求骨髓配對，但親屬間沒有合適者。
二○○五年二月，他在泰國找到百分之百相合的配對者。這就像天上掉下來的禮物一樣，讓他和家人有了一絲希望；不久後，對方卻突然反悔，上天又把禮物狠狠地從他手上奪走，完全不留一絲情面。醫師安慰他：「再往其他的國家找找看。」這次，他不敢抱太大希望，他沒把握有力氣再承受一次的失望。
六月，當幸運之神再次降臨時，他不敢高興得太早，等到台灣的捐贈者確定願意時，才真正放下心頭上壓著的大石頭。雖然石頭拿開了，但阿力斯還有另一道難題，這次的捐髓者和他只有百分之七十的吻合度。在太太的鼓勵下，夫妻倆決定一起面對、奮鬥下去。
儘管有風險，但他真的累了，也不想再繼續等下去。也許幾年後，會有一個人和他百分之百吻合；也許那個人永遠不會出現。但無論如何，他決定這次要試試，很快就在七月排定要接受造血幹細胞移植。
不過，好事多磨，就算再幸運也都可能遇到無法預期的考驗，來自南非骨髓資料庫的取髓人員，竟遇到一生都沒見過的台灣夏季名產——「颱風」。
颱風環伺，越洋送髓
由世界骨髓捐贈者協會（WMDA, World Marrow Donor Association）整理全世界送髓者遇到的風雨實錄中，有一段關於泰瑞（Terry Schlaphoff）二○○五年七月第一次到台灣取髓的描述，除了是南非與慈濟的第一次合作之外，還是泰瑞遇到人生另一個難題的第一次。
「取髓人員被訓練各種危機處理，但是並沒有想到會面對即將登陸的颱風！然而這卻真實發生在我的台灣取髓之行。」來自南非骨髓資料庫的取髓人員泰瑞回憶當時來台時，是南非與慈濟合作的首例。她自願前來花蓮慈濟醫院取髓，沒想到竟遇上超級強烈颱風海棠。　
她描述，當時慈濟骨髓幹細胞中心安排志工從機場接機到飯店，在路途中，志工淡定地對她說：「颱風要來了，不要害怕！」她說她永遠記得這段對話，但因為在南非從來沒有見識過颱風，所以她回應志工：「我當然很害怕啊！」志工進一步向她說明，會把她安全送到飯店，因為捐贈者已經在醫院準備做造血幹細胞的收集。慈濟志工也向她解說，這個颱風將會在收集造血幹細胞時，通過台灣陸地，應該不會影響泰瑞回程的航班起飛。
很快地，就在泰瑞抵達飯店不久後，超級強烈颱風以每小時超過兩百五十公里的速度登陸。「一整天，飯店都在前後搖晃！」泰瑞只能不斷地祈禱。
好消息是：雖然颱風來襲，但捐贈者已在颱風過境前抵達醫院，所以在風雨吹襲的醫院裡，醫療團隊如期收集了足夠的造血幹細胞。在此同時，南非骨髓庫和慈濟骨髓幹細胞中心的團隊也絞盡腦汁，共同找出一條替代路線，讓泰瑞先從台灣飛到香港轉機，再從香港直飛南非。　
隔天颱風離境，泰瑞順利地從台北抵達花蓮慈濟醫院取髓，緊繃的心情才舒緩下來。「在我離境之前，慈濟骨髓幹細胞中心的創辦人證嚴法師，還特地為我與這個造血幹細胞祝福，這是充滿幸運的一天。」泰瑞就在眾人齊心祝福下，順利完成艱鉅的送髓任務。
走過生死交界，人生更豁達
風雨生信心，獲得寶貴造血幹細胞移植機會的阿力斯，受贈康復後，不但活得很健康，人生觀也變得更豁達。「不確定這是不是捐贈者對我的改變，還是這場病讓我更懂得珍惜生命。」他聳聳肩、露出俏皮的笑容，他說自己過去個性很保守，凡事都要深思熟慮，現在不一樣了，變得很豪爽，嘴邊常說「OK」。
受贈之後的八年間，阿力斯並不知道「台灣」在哪裡，由於英文發音很接近，他還誤以為台灣（Taiwan）是泰國（Thailand）的一部分。直到二○一三年中，南非慈濟志工邀他到台灣參加慈濟舉辦的骨髓相見歡，他們夫妻才真正認識台灣。
穿上傳統服飾，致上最高敬意
二○一三年九月十八日，阿力斯夫妻整整花了三十六個小時，終於飛抵台灣。太太說，從下飛機就看到慈濟人的謙虛與溫暖。在靜思堂，志工導覽南非慈濟人行善的事蹟，當他們看到慈濟在全球的志工組織與足跡，感到非常不可思議。為了要見恩人，阿力斯的太太特別穿著傳統服飾與會，代表他們內心最誠摯的感恩及尊重。
這麼多年來，阿力斯經常假想捐贈者的模樣：大約四十歲，男性，頭髮微捲，身高約一百七十到一百八十公分。相見歡當天下午，謎底揭曉，他看見恩人尹先生長得高又帥，和自己想像的模樣非常接近。他和尹先生緊緊相擁，再虔敬地以雙手合十彎身至地，用右手輕觸尹先生的腳，然後回觸自己的額頭。這是印度傳統對長輩、恩人表達最高敬意的「摸腳禮」。阿力斯說：「黑黃配對我來說是奇蹟，證明我們原來就是一家人。」
阿力斯的太太看著這一幕頻頻拭淚，在丈夫起身後，她接著向捐髓者行摸腳禮。對阿力斯夫妻的感恩大禮，木訥的尹先生直說，他真的只是做了「像捐血」一般的事。不過，這南非與台灣第一次的髓緣，還間接促成了一對佳偶。尹太太在與尹先生交往期間，知道他是一位捐髓者，心想，願意捐髓的人一定是好人。
阿力斯感動地說：「他給我的不只是生命的重生，對我的父母來說，他給了他們一個兒子；對妻子及孩子來說，他給了一位先生和爸爸；對兄弟來說，他給的是一個兄弟；對我的朋友來說，他給的是一位活生生存在的朋友。」這兩天與慈濟人相處之中，讓阿力斯夫妻感動得流了不少眼淚，更留下永生難忘的回憶。阿力斯太太說，回國後要去拜訪當地慈濟志工，一起為社會付出。

作者：慈濟骨髓幹細胞中心

我們在找一個人，那個人可能就是你！

全世界，每三分鐘就有一個人得到血癌；在台灣，每個月平均有三百位病患在等待移植，他可以治療，但需要你的幫助。
罹患血液疾病的病友，往往有極高的生命危險，除了化學治療，許多病友唯有透過骨髓幹細胞移植，才能活下來。然而，骨髓移植必須在茫茫人海中找到合適的配對者——而配對成功的機率，只有二千分之一至一億分之一。
配對成功的捐贈者阿成，原本是位菸酒檳榔不離手，一天都不能沒有酒喝的人。心軟的他，卻在允諾捐贈後，開始擔心受贈病人體衰力微，萬一自己的惡習影響捐贈品質，豈不讓病人受累。於是，捐贈前他狠下心來戒酒兩周，竟讓他從此遠離惡習。
曾獲金馬獎最佳男配角的張書豪，在得知配對成功後，大量攝取蔬菜、均衡飲食，更加強慢跑等運動鍛鍊，讓身體保持最佳狀態。捐贈前碰到寒流來襲，他自行禁足，只為隔離感染流感的可能性，以提供最佳品質的周邊血幹細胞。
本書所敘說的，正是台灣社會大眾無私的愛，讓「慈濟骨髓幹細胞中心」成立25年來，累積超過43萬名志願捐髓者的愛心建檔，提供迫在眉睫的病人查詢；更在捐贈者、志工、醫師、護理人員等與時間賽跑的努力下，將新生命的希望送到了31個國家地區，搶救了超過五千個生命與家庭。
他們從死神手上搶下名單，他們深信「落地為兄弟，何必骨肉親」，他們的大愛讓受盡病苦折磨的血液疾病病人與家屬，得以走出死亡幽谷，重新活出精彩人生。
一本關於病苦與大愛的故事，期待您的參與！只要多一位朋友加入骨髓驗血建檔，這個世界就多一個重生的機會！在這個地球上，我們都是一家人。

""Love, the marrow is all"": ""Black and yellow match"" is a miracle for me - the most salute from South Africa
01 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Summary


What we want you to know is the confidence of the wind and rain, and the opportunity to obtain valuable hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. After receiving the rehabilitation, not only will you live a healthy life, but your outlook on life will become more open-minded. ""Not sure if this is a change to the donor, or whether the disease makes me know how to cherish life.""



Text: Chen Yizhen, Jiang Jingyi, Hu Ruizhu, Liu Wei
The most salute from South Africa
""Black and yellow are miracles for me. I really appreciate everyone who helped me to be born again. I can match and transplant in Taiwan, indicating that human beings are not ethnic, large or old. On earth, we originally It’s a family.” Amrith Prithrajsing, an Indian-born recipient from South Africa, said his true feelings.
It took 36 hours to get to Hualien from Johannesburg, South Africa. The 45-year-old Alice’s face was not tired. His wife sat next to her, both of whom were Indian, with deep sable, brown skin. Talking about the process from illness to rebirth, although the expression is always calm, the inner feelings of the heart are revealed from the speech little by little...
why me? What about my wife and children?
In 2003, he found that his body appeared indigo. Although he was suspicious, he quickly found a reason to make himself feel good. ""Where is it going to hit it!"" Soon, the wife who worked in the bank just scheduled health. Check, accompanied by Aris casually asked the doctor about the youthful things.
""First take a look at the blood,"" the doctor said. The evening's inspection report was released, and the doctor told him that he had suffered from ""CML, chronic myelogenous leukemia."" ""What is CML?"" The family has been in panic without knowing what the disease is. He was even more shocked and totally unacceptable. He kept thinking about ""why is it me? Why is it me?""
At the time, Alice was thirty-five years old. His wife was a year old. He had two children, one was nine years old and one was five years old, regardless of his work and family. ""What should the wife and the child do?"" He closed his eyes and asked the sky several times, and his heartache burst into tears.
For about two weeks, his entire portrait was lost, as if drifting on the sea. One day, he remembered his father who died, remembering his loneliness and helplessness at the age of eleven. When Dad and the two children overlapped each other, Alice suddenly woke up - he decided not to repeat the past.
""Treatment!"" he told his wife.
Two pairs, the unknown Taiwan gave him hope
The side effects of chemotherapy made him suffer, and his body was weak and he did not even have the strength to speak. Sometimes he continued to have a high fever for several days, and the mouth ulceration prevented him from eating. Nine months later, the original eighty-eight kilograms of him, thin to only 45 kilograms, was tortured by the disease to be not adult. As a last resort, he decided to abandon chemotherapy and turned to bone marrow matching, but there was no suitable person among relatives.
In February 2005, he found a 100% match in Thailand. This is like a gift falling from the sky, so that he and his family have a glimmer of hope; soon after, the other party suddenly repented, and God took the gift from his hand, leaving no trace of affection. The doctor comforted him: ""Looking to other countries to look for it."" This time, he did not dare to hold too much hope, he did not have the strength to take another disappointment.
In June, when the lucky god came down again, he did not dare to be too happy. When the donors in Taiwan decided to be willing, they really let go of the big stones that were pressing on their hearts. Although the stone was taken away, there was another problem with Aris. This time, the donors were only 70% identical to him. With the encouragement of the wife, the couple decided to face and struggle together.
Despite the risks, he is really tired and doesn't want to wait any longer. Maybe a few years later, there will be a person who is 100% consistent with him; maybe that person will never appear. But in any case, he decided to try this time, and soon scheduled to accept hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in July.
However, if things are too good, even if they are lucky, they may encounter unpredictable tests. The bone marrow personnel from the South African bone marrow database have encountered Taiwan's summer famous products, ""Typhoon.""
The typhoon circumvents the ocean
In the storms recorded by the World Marrow Donor Association (WMDA, World Marrow Donor Association), there was a paragraph about Terry Schlaphoff’s first visit to Taiwan in July 2005. The description, in addition to the first cooperation between South Africa and Tzu Chi, is the first time that Terry has encountered another problem in life.
""The people who took the marrow were trained in various crises, but they did not expect to face the typhoon that was about to land! However, this happened in my Taiwanese journey."" Terry, a pulper from the South African bone marrow database, recalled When I came to Taiwan, it was the first case of cooperation between South Africa and Tzu Chi. She voluntarily came to Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital to take the marrow, but did not expect to encounter a super strong typhoon Haitang.
She described that at the time, the Tzu Chi Bone Stem Cell Center arranged for volunteers to pick up the plane from the airport to the hotel. On the way, the volunteers said to her calmly: ""The typhoon is coming, don't be afraid!"" She said she always remembers this conversation. But because she had never seen a typhoon in South Africa, she responded to volunteers: ""Of course I am very scared!"" The volunteers further explained to her that she would be safely sent to the hotel because the donor was already in the hospital to prepare hematopoietic stem cells. collect. Tzu Chi volunteers also explained to her that this typhoon will pass through Taiwan's land when collecting hematopoietic stem cells, and it should not affect the flight of Terry's return flight.
Soon, just after Terry arrived at the hotel, the super strong typhoon landed at a speed of more than 250 kilometers per hour. ""All day, the hotel is shaking back and forth!"" Terry can only pray constantly.
The good news is that although the typhoon struck, the donors arrived at the hospital before the typhoon passed, so in the storm-stricken hospital, the medical team collected enough hematopoietic stem cells as scheduled. At the same time, the South African Marrow Bank and the Tzu Chi Bone Stem Cell Center team also racked their brains to find an alternative route, let Teri first fly from Taiwan to Hong Kong, and then fly directly from Hong Kong to South Africa.
The next day the typhoon departed, Terry successfully arrived at the Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital from Taipei to take the marrow, and the tension was relieved. ""Before I left the country, the founder of the Tzu Chi Bone Marrow Stem Cell Center, I also blessed me with this hematopoietic stem cell. This is a day full of luck."" Terry has successfully completed the difficult task with the blessing of all. Send the marrow task.
Walking through the border between life and death, life is more open-minded
After the rain and confidence, Aris, who was given the opportunity of valuable hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, was rewarded with a healthy life and a more open-minded outlook on life. ""I'm not sure if this is a change to the donor, or whether the disease makes me know how to cherish life."" He shrugged and showed a playful smile. He said that his past personality was very conservative, everything was well thought out, and now it is different. It became very bold, and I often said ""OK"".
In the eight years after the donation, Aris did not know where ""Taiwan"" was. Because the English pronunciation was very close, he mistakenly thought that Taiwan was part of Thailand. Until mid-2013, South African Tzu Chi volunteers invited him to Taiwan to participate in the bone marrow meeting in Tzu Chi, and their husband and wife really knew Taiwan.
Put on traditional costumes and pay the highest respect
On September 18, 2013, the couple spent a total of thirty-six hours and finally flew to Taiwan. The wife said that the humility and warmth of the Tzu Chi people were seen from the plane. In Jingsitang, the volunteers guided the deeds of the Tzu Chi people in South Africa. When they saw Tzu Chi’s global organization and footprint, it was incredible. In order to see the benefactor, Mrs. Aris's wife is especially dressed in traditional costumes, representing their most sincere gratitude and respect.
For many years, Alice often imagined the appearance of a donor: about forty years old, male, with a small volume of hair, about one hundred and seventy to eighty-eight centimeters tall. On the afternoon of the meeting, the mystery was revealed. He saw that the benefactor, Mr. Yin, was tall and handsome, and he was very close to what he imagined. He and Mr. Yin hugged each other, and then reverently folded their hands to the ground, touched Mr. Yin's foot with his right hand, and then touched his forehead. This is the ""touching ceremony"" that the Indian tradition expresses the highest respect for the elders and benefactors. Alice said: ""Black and yellow are miraculous to me, proving that we are a family.""
Mrs. Alice’s wife watched the scene and wiped her tears. After her husband got up, she went to the donor’s foot. To the grateful gift of the Alice couple, Mr. Yin, who is a gentleman, said that he really only did something like ""blood donation."" However, the first episode of South Africa and Taiwan has indirectly contributed to a pair of couples. During Mrs. Yin’s interaction with Mr. Yin, he knew that he was a donor, and he thought that those who are willing to donate must be good people.
Alice moved and said: ""He gave me not only the rebirth of life, but to my parents, he gave them a son; for his wife and children, he gave a gentleman and father; to the brothers. In fact, he is giving a brother; for my friend, he is a friend who lives and lives."" These two days with the Tzu Chi people, let the Alice couple moved. Less tears, and more memorable memories. Mrs. Alice said that after returning home, she would visit local Tzu Chi volunteers and pay for the society together.

We are looking for someone, that person may be you!

In the world, one person gets blood cancer every three minutes. In Taiwan, an average of 300 patients are waiting for a transplant every month. He can treat, but needs your help.
Patients suffering from blood diseases often have a very high risk of life. In addition to chemotherapy, many patients can survive only through bone marrow stem cell transplantation. However, bone marrow transplants must find the right match in the vast sea of people – and the chances of successful pairing are only between one in two and one in one billion.
A successful pairing partner, A Cheng, was originally a tobacco and alcohol betel nut who did not leave his hands and could not drink without drinking. The soft-hearted person, after promised to donate, began to worry about the sickness of the recipient, and if his bad habits affected the quality of the donation, he would not let the patient suffer. So, before the donation, he took the time to stop drinking for two weeks, so that he would stay away from bad habits.
After reading the successful matching, Zhang Shuhao, who won the Golden Horse Award for Best Supporting Actor, took a lot of vegetables, balanced diet, and strengthened jogging and other exercise to keep his body in top condition. Before the donation, he encountered a cold spell. He banned himself only to isolate the possibility of contracting the flu to provide the best quality peripheral blood stem cells.
What is described in this book is the selfless love of the Taiwanese public. Let the Tzu Chi Bone Marrow Stem Cell Center accumulate more than 430,000 volunteers to build a file for 25 years, providing urgent patient enquiries; With the efforts of time, volunteers, physicians, and nursing staff, the hope of new life was sent to 31 countries and regions, and more than 5,000 lives and families were saved.
They grabbed the list from the hands of the gods. They are convinced that ""the land is a brother, why bother to be close to each other"". Their great love allows the blood-sick patients and their families who suffer from suffering and suffering to get out of the valley of death and relive their wonderful life.
A story about illness and love, look forward to your participation! As long as more than one friend joins the bone marrow blood test file, the world will have another chance to be born again! On this planet, we are all family.
