《裝睡的人叫不醒，再不清醒窮死你》：怕就怕，你沒有公主命，還一身的公主病
01 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是安全感來自你自身的強大，來自內心的獨立和自足。就像早上拉開窗簾看到的陽光、走在繁華路口看見的紅綠燈、查看銀行戶頭時看到的充裕的餘額、玩手機時上面顯示的滿格電量……



文：老楊的貓頭鷹
謝你不娶之恩
我們常常聽見這樣的示愛宣言：「我願為了你，負了這天下。」「我願為了你，換一種活法。」「我願為了你，什麼都去做，什麼險都去冒。」
「因為是你，做什麼都値得。」「因為是你，所以什麼都願意。」
言外之意是，「我愛你愛得這麼深，你就算不心動，也得感動」。可在我看來，這些話更像是那種一下午能簽三千多張的空頭支票。你無非是想說：「我什麼都沒有，我什麼都不要，但我愛你，你看著辦。」
這哪是示愛，更像是要脅！可你只是他的戀人，又不是恩人。
我們也常常聽見這樣的牢騷：「為了你，我放棄了一流的大學和工作，來到你在的城市。」「為了你，我放棄了大城市的繁華和便捷，隨你去陌生地方重新開始。」「為了你，我選擇與父母分離，陪你到擧目無親的遠方。」
言外之意是，「我付出了那麼多，你就算不感恩戴德，也得時刻記著」。
可在我看來，這些話更像是某個商業合約上的條款，你無非是想說：「我把一切都交給你了，你也該給我一些同等的回報。」
這哪是談戀愛，分明是在簽賣身契。可他只是你的愛人，又不是欠你債的人。
不論是愛或者被愛，都不要讓愛變得沉重，然後背著它，如履薄冰地生活。那些與現實格格不入的愛，一般都不會長久。
愛是恆久忍耐又有恩慈，但不是沒有下限的忍耐；愛是包容、相信、不輕易發怒，但不是低聲下氣的附和。
曾以為，婚戀中講究「門當戶對」是陋習，是人性的弱點，如今看來，它很現實，更符合人心。因為門不當戶不對造成的巨大差異，早晚會發展為愛的鴻溝。
我所謂的現實，是你們互相配得上對方，你們兩個出身的家庭能眞正地接納對方，你們不必為了對方而做出脫胎換骨的痛苦改變，你們也不用為了彰顯愛情的偉大而讓自己變得卑微，甚至放棄自己本該擁有的一切。
我所謂的人心，是指在各種觀念大體相似的基礎上，彼此的興趣可以有所不同，不會基於自己的判斷去干涉對方。
弱弱地問一句，談個戀愛要三天兩頭地掉眼淚，你到底是找了個男朋友，還是找了顆洋蔥？
對女孩而言，好看的妝容，得體的穿戴，有品味的生活，談得來的圈子，充足的物質保證，這些才是對抗這個殘酷又現實的世界最靠譜的鎧甲，遠比男人們忽冷忽熱的問候、忽遠忽近的關懷要有用得多。
別一遇到感情問題，你就噘著嘴巴哭鬧：「你從來都沒有給我安全感！」安全感不是別人給的。就算你一天二十四小時纏著他，就算電話簡訊不間斷，就算你霸占他所有空閒的時間，就算你摸淸他全部的行蹤，你依然得不到安全感。
安全感來自你自身的強大，來自內心的獨立和自足。就像早上拉開窗簾看到的陽光、走在繁華路口看見的紅綠燈、查看銀行戶頭時看到的充裕的餘額、玩手機時上面顯示的滿格電量……
所以，不要再厚著臉皮去懷念那個放棄你的人，也不要眞的跑到他的面前說「謝謝」，他根本沒做什麼讓你成長的事，讓你成長的是你的反思、堅強和努力。
再說了，笑笑就能過去的事，何必把它弄得盡人皆知？
來吧來吧，對那個枉費過你付出眞心的人說最後一句話：「我現在過得好得不得了，耶！」

公主病
一個女孩想要過公主一樣任性的生活，這並沒什麼問題，但前提是，這不應該成為他人的負擔。
如果你生在深宮內院，你大可以要風得風，要雨得雨。倘若哪天對廚子不滿意，就把桌子上的盤子都摔碎了，然後跟你那個有權有勢的老爸吿狀，讓廚子瞬間消失；如果對戀人不滿意，你大可以提著蕾絲連衣裙，踮著腳尖走出大門口，然後坐上你專屬的豪華馬車，絕塵而去。
可如果你只是普羅大眾，如果你連獨立生活的勇氣和資本都沒有，你又哪來的資格胡鬧、刁蠻、任性呢？
怕就怕，你沒有公主命，還一身的公主病：自己長得貌不驚人，還對別人挑三揀四；自己賺的錢都養不活自己，還嫌貧愛富；自己老得都快成「聖女」了，還天天說那些相親對象是奇葩，還動不動就自稱「像我這樣優秀的女生……」
你那麼喜歡童話，想必你也知道，假公主一般都沒有什麼好結局的吧！
別人加班加點地工作，你連一句關心都沒有，自己受了點委屈，就要求別人千里萬里奔赴而來送溫柔體貼；別人忙翻天的時候，你連個吃飯地點都懶得選，自己過生日了，就要求對方能像七十二變的孫猴子那樣變著花樣取悅你；別人公務繁忙，你連家務都懶得做，自己一個人的時候，恨不得連水龍頭都轉不動。
是的，你是女孩，是應該好好愛自己，可是你不能打著愛的名義，把基本的自理、基本的義務都轉嫁給別人啊！
這樣的你，在生活中只會是個糟糕的朋友，在感情中只會是個可怕的累贅！
偶爾任性一下，也許他還覺得你挺可愛的，覺得你「天眞無邪」，但如果你天天如此，他能記住的只是你的無理取鬧，到最後，恐怕他對你最大的心願只會是「哪兒涼快哪兒待著去」。
親愛的女孩，你的命眞的很好，你也有機會遇到一個王子一般的好男人，但是請你別忘了，能二十四小時侍奉公主的，那是奴僕，王子只管風花雪月的那部分！
如果你堅持非要胡鬧，非要任性，一定要試探他的底線，那麼你一定能如願以償地失去他，然後重新回到沒有愛情的生活中去。
也許，愛你的人會哄你，向你道歉，送你禮物，最後掏空心思地把你哄好，但他的內心深處，其實正經歷著一場浩劫。他越是討好式地愛你，這場浩劫越大，他也越疲憊。
別以為你的胡攪蠻纏、肆意妄為是可愛，眞正能稱得上可愛的，不是這些幼稚和不講道理，而是你本性裡留存的、極易耗盡的純眞！
我的建議是，不要像個落難者，吿訴所有人你的落魄和寂寞。總有一天你會明白，難過的事情都要靠自己消化，難忘的人都得靠自己放下。
趁著還年輕就好好照顧自己的臉，努力養肥自己的錢包，而不要逢人就說曾經如何如何得意或者悲傷，以及現在怎樣怎樣灑脫或者失望。眞正能理解你，眞正願意替你化解問題的人沒有幾個，他們多數只是站在他們自己的立場，說冠冕堂皇或言不由衷的便宜話。而你要做的就是把祕密、傷痛都藏起來，然後一步一步地讓自己厲害起來！
變厲害就意味著，曾經因為一點風吹草動的小事就能多愁善感，到如今，即便是翻山越嶺，你單槍匹馬也應付得來。這樣的你，別說扭開瓶蓋了，消防栓都不在話下！

""The person who sleeps is not awake, and you are not awake and dying."": I am afraid, you have no princess, and you are still a princess.
01 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Summary


What we want you to know is that the sense of security comes from your own strength, from the inner independence and self-sufficiency. It's like the sunshine that you see when you open the curtains in the morning, the traffic lights you see at the bustling intersection, the abundance of balances you see when you look at the bank account, and the full amount of power shown on your phone.



Text: Old Yang's Owl
Thank you for your kindness.
We often hear such a declaration of love: ""I will bear this world for you."" ""I will change a living method for you."" ""I will do it for you, and do whatever it takes.""
""Because it is you, you can do whatever you want."" ""Because it is you, I am willing to do anything.""
The implication is that ""I love you so deeply, you have to be touched if you don't feel heart."" In my opinion, these words are more like the kind of empty check that can sign more than 3,000 in an afternoon. You just want to say: ""I have nothing, I don't want anything, but I love you, you look at it.""
This is a show of love, more like a threat! But you are just his lover, not a benefactor.
We often hear such complaints: ""For you, I gave up the first-class university and work and came to your city."" ""For you, I gave up the bustling and convenient city, and started again with you in a strange place."" ""For you, I choose to be separated from my parents and accompany you to the unaccompanied distance.""
The implication is that ""I have paid so much, and you have to remember when you are not grateful to Dade.""
In my opinion, these words are more like the terms of a commercial contract. You just want to say: ""I have given everything to you, and you should give me some equal rewards.""
This is a love affair, it is clearly a signing of a deed. But he is only your lover, not someone who owes you debt.
Whether you love or be loved, don't let love become heavy, then carry it on your bare feet. Those loves that are incompatible with reality will generally not last long.
Love is endurance and kindness, but it is not the endurance without a lower limit; love is tolerance, belief, not easy to anger, but not a low-key reconciliation.
I thought that it is bad habit to pay attention to ""door-to-door"" in marriage and love. It is a weakness of human nature. Now it seems that it is realistic and more in line with people's hearts. Because of the huge difference caused by improper door-to-door, it will develop into a love gap sooner or later.
My so-called reality is that you are worthy of each other. The two families you are born with can accept each other's righteousness. You don't have to make painful changes for the other side. You don't have to change yourself to show the greatness of love. Get humble and even give up everything you should have.
My so-called people's heart means that on the basis of various similarities, the interests of each other can be different, and they will not interfere with each other based on their own judgment.
Weakly ask, talk about a love to tears in three days, are you looking for a boyfriend, or looking for an onion?
For girls, good-looking makeup, decent dressing, tasteful life, talked circles, and sufficient material guarantees, these are the most reliable armor against this cruel and realistic world, far more than men’s Cold and hot greetings, cares that are far and near are much more useful.
When you encounter emotional problems, you will cry with your mouth: ""You never give me a sense of security!"" The sense of security is not given by others. Even if you are pestering him 24 hours a day, even if the phone newsletter is uninterrupted, even if you occupy all his free time, even if you touch all his whereabouts, you still can't feel safe.
The sense of security comes from your own strength, from the inner independence and self-sufficiency. It's like the sunshine that you see when you open the curtains in the morning, the traffic lights you see at the bustling intersection, the abundance of balances you see when you look at the bank account, and the full amount of power shown on your phone.
So, don't be cheeky to miss the one who gave up on you, don't run to him and say ""thank you"". He didn't do anything to make you grow up. What makes you grow is your reflection and strength. And work hard.
Besides, why can you make it happen by laughing and laughing?
Come on, let me say the last sentence to someone who has spent your time worrying: ""I am so good now, yeah!""

Princess disease
A girl wants to live a polite life like a princess. This is fine, but the premise is that this should not be a burden on others.
If you are born in the inner courtyard of the deep palace, you can have a good wind and rain. If you are dissatisfied with the cook one day, break the plate on the table, and then wander with your powerful master, let the cook disappear instantly; if you are not satisfied with the lover, you can carry the lace Dress, walk out of the gate with your toes, then sit on your exclusive luxury carriage and go away.
But if you are just the general public, if you don't have the courage and capital to live independently, where are you qualified, arrogant, and willful?
I am afraid that you will not have a princess life, but also a princess who is sick: he is not astonishing in appearance, but he also picks and chooses others; he can not raise his own money, but he also loves the rich; he is old. Quickly become a ""saint"", and still say that those blind date objects are wonderful, and they still call themselves ""excellent girls like me...""
You like fairy tales so much, you must know that fake princesses generally have no good endings!
When someone works overtime and work harder, you don't even care about one sentence. If you are wronged, you will ask others to go there and send them to be gentle and considerate. When others are busy, you will not even have to choose a place to eat, and you will have a birthday. I ask the other party to change the pattern like the 72-year-old granddaughter to please you; others are busy with business, you are too lazy to do housework, when you are alone, you can't wait for the faucet to turn.
Yes, you are a girl, you should love yourself, but you can not pass on the basic self-care and basic obligations to others in the name of love!
This kind of you, in life will only be a bad friend, in the relationship will only be a terrible burden!
Occasionally, he may feel that you are very cute. I feel that you are ""innocent,"" but if you do it every day, what he can remember is just your unreasonable trouble. In the end, I am afraid that his biggest wish for you will only be It is ""Where is it cool?""
Dear girl, your life is very good, you also have the opportunity to meet a good man like a prince, but please don't forget, you can serve the princess twenty-four hours, that is a slave, the prince only manages the part of the snowy month !
If you insist on having to be arrogant, you must be willful, you must test his bottom line, then you will be able to lose him as you wish, and then return to life without love.
Maybe, someone who loves you will marry you, apologize to you, give you a present, and finally slap you up, but his heart is actually experiencing a catastrophe. The more he likes you, the more he loves you. The bigger the catastrophe, the more exhausted he is.
Don't think that your hustle and hustle is arrogant, and you can be called cute. You can be called cute, not these naive and unreasonable, but the pure cockroaches that you have left in your own nature!
My advice is, don't be like a victim, tell everyone about your despair and loneliness. One day you will understand that sad things must be digested by themselves, and unforgettable people have to let go of themselves.
When you are still young, take care of your face and try to fatten your wallet, instead of saying how to be proud or sad, and how to be free and easy or disappointed. You are able to understand you. There are not many people who are willing to solve problems for you. Most of them are just standing in their own positions, saying that they are honest or insincere. And what you have to do is hide the secrets and hurts, and then make yourself a step by step!
Being awesome means that you have been sentimental because of the little things that have been swaying, and nowadays, even if you are over the mountains, you can handle it alone. This kind of you, let alone twist the bottle cap, the fire hydrant is not in the words!

""Don't choose ease in this struggle"", ""The charming bastard wins respect, the good guys are busy seeking approval"", ""Poverty reduction is more important than taking off the order"" The brainstorming series has sold a total of 150,000 copies! If you have been woken up by Lao Yang's owl, you must have this book!

Dedicated to the soft and ruthless baby who wants to be too beautiful, glass heart, and not enough, to wake up to the shameful head that is satisfied with the small fortunate and daydreaming!

In an unfair world, there must be a heart that does not admit defeat. There is no dream that can't be achieved, only the one who can't wake up!

Lao Yang’s owl said: Don’t try to change the status quo if you want to be awake by a sentence or a book. The laziest way to live is to read the truth and read about life.

Life, life, there is no end to the level, unless you see your ugly and poor, but still set a beautiful filter for life, reluctant to wake up!

You don’t have to look at yourself, but you just don’t have talent. You said that you want to live comfortably and freely. In fact, you are just lazy at the end of the cancer. You admire no one knows how to cherish you, in fact, because you have poor conditions.
From time to time, you complain that life is so difficult, God is not fair, the boss is not small, but also like a giant baby crying all day long. You have to know that the world will not comfort you. It will only give you back all your shackles; you must know that if you are not awake, poverty will bring tragic and regretful, and will not attack you with mercy!
Don't make excuses for your laziness, sentimentality, and glass heart. Don't wait for the noble people who don't exist to wake you up. What you are urging you to change is your uneasiness and dissatisfaction with the status quo. It is your hope for the future. It is you. Not willing to be ordinary!
The old Yang's owl once again presents the most spicy and sour chapter of the ""Wake Up Brain Series"" with a sharp stroke, and opens a new prescription for your intractable disease. You can tear it through the pain points and wake up. you!
