A man will serve at least 26 in jail after murdering a father of four who became the innocent victim of a brutal family feud.
Nabeel Choudhary, 21, from West Bromwich, was part of a group of seven who brutally stabbed Yassir Hussain to death.
Mr Justice Nicol jailed Choudhary for life and ordered he serve a minimum term of 26 years and 37 days.
A Birmingham Crown Court trial heard Mr Hussain tried to flee outside the Golden City takeaway in Lower Gornal on December 4 last year but was trapped and hacked to death.
Mr Hussain's family paid tribute to him as a ""gentle"" man who was an ""innocent"" in a long-running family feud that led to the chilling machete attack.
The court heard how Choudhary had previously threatened his cousin cousin Morrad Hussain, who managed to flee the scene.

Choudhary was sentenced to life in prison for murder but there was no separate sentence for charges of attempted grievous bodily harm and dangerous driving.
Meanwhile, police believe more people were involved in the chilling attack , and the investigation continues into the Central Drive incident.
Choudhary was acquitted of having an imitation firearm and Akarsh Tasleem was acquitted of murder and possessing a bladed article.
The hearing at Birmingham Crown Court heard how Mr Hussain was visiting family in the area from his home in Nelson near Burnley, where he was a shopkeeper.
Yasmin Akhtar, one of three sisters of the victim, said in a statement said the family were “broken and destroyed” and that her brother’s death was “unnecessary and cruel”.
”He was innocent of any of the wrong doings between the families,” she said.
She it was terrible for her brother to die in the way he did.
”He was a kind and gentle man, a family man with four children.”
Miss Akhtar said he is “very much alive” for them.
