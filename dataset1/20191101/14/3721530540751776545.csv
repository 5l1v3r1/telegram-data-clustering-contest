Toby Fox, the developer and composer behind Undertale, has announced that he’s made music for the new Pokémon games. Fox announced on Twitter on Friday morning that he composed a track for Pokémon Sword and Shield.



Fox has composed music for many games and projects in the past, outside of his work on his own game. Early on, Fox composed music for Homestuck, as one of many community composers who helped bring music to the popular webcomic. Fox later composed music for the Homestuck video game, Hiveswap as well.
This isn’t the first time that Fox has worked with Pokémon developer Game Freak either. Earlier this year, Fox composed for the developer’s game, Little Town Hero, which was arranged by Pokémon composer Hitomi Sato.
Fox further explain on Twitter that he didn’t work on the games’ title track, but that he was still excited to be involved.
Pokémon Sword and Shield are set to release later this year on Nov. 15.
