Today's Horoscope: November 1, 2019

01 Nov 2019, 14:04


Here’s your daily horoscope for November 1, 2019, according to 

Mecca Woods

, Bustle’s resident astrologer and creator of 

MyLifeCreated.com

. We’re constantly fascinated by what our zodiac sign says about our lives, whether it's 

which signs are most compatible

 or how each sign handles conflict in relationships. Below, a look at how astrology will affect our lives today.

The Moon remains in pragmatic Capricorn today, putting much of the emphasis on work, productivity, and our ambitions. Considering this lunar placement, we should find ourselves looking to put in the hard work and dedication to achieve success where we want to see success the most in our lives.
The Moon in Capricorn teams up with unconventional Uranus in Taurus at the start of the day which can help us to initiate new projects or take a new approach towards achieving a goal. By the late afternoon, the Moon teams up with the Sun in passionate Scorpio, which can help us to find the determination we need to clear obstacles in our path or overcome a challenge.
Still, the biggest planetary shift of the day occurs later in the afternoon when love planet Venus leaves the depths of Scorpio for happy-go-lucky Sagittarius. With Venus in Sagittarius for the next few weeks, we should find that the people and things that we value most are associated with themes like travel, adventure, generosity, learning and philosophy, and growth.
Read below to see what the stars mean for your sign today, and make sure to check out your November 2019 monthly horoscope.
