Timothée Chalamet & Lily-Rose Depp's Relationship Timeline Revolves Around 'The King'

01 Nov 2019, 14:34

After more than a year together, Timothée Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp are taking their reported relationship from real life to the big screen. Together, they're starring as husband and wife in The King, a Netflix movie based on the life of King Henry V. Since Depp and Chalamet have kept their dating lives pretty private so far, it can be hard to pinpoint where it all started — and where they stand as a couple today. However, this timeline of Depp and Chalamet's relationship should help clear things up a bit.
Although Chalamet has been acting for more than a decade, he's best known for more recent films like Ladybird and Call Me By Your Name, while Depp, the daughter of Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis, is more of a newcomer to the acting scene. As both of their careers have picked up, so has the interest in their relationship... even though neither of them have said much about each other in a romantic context — at least not yet. (Bustle has reached out to their reps for comment on their relationship status, but did not receive an immediate response.)
Here's everything fans need to know about Chalamet and Depp's relationship, from the time rumors first began to present day.
