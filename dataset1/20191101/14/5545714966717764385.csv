Everything that happened at BlizzCon 2019's opening ceremony
Diablo IV! Overwatch 2! Is it enough to forgive?
01 Nov 2019, 14:45 by Chris Carter
I've seen every BlizzCon in the history of the company, and this one has got to be one of the weirdest. After the crowd turned on Blizzard last year over Diablo Immortal, we got Diablo IV in the best way possible: a really good horrific cinematic trailer and actual gameplay.
Following up Blizzard confirmed a few menial announcements, like the fact that all characters are free-to-play in Heroes of the Storm until November 10, and Starcraft II was getting its token commander Arcturus Mengsk. Hearthstone is ending the Year of the Dragon cycle with...dragons, and Sylvanas crushed the Lich King's helmet to set up the events of the new WoW Shadowlands expansion, due in late 2020.
Overwatch 2 capped off the event, with confirmation that all cosmetics would carry over, and all Overwatch 1 players will be able to play on all maps for the PVP component of the game. Ambitious! Let's see if it works out and the userbase isn't too fragmented. After all, a release window and platforms weren't even mentioned.
I'm surprised more wasn't done in terms of making amends (my pipe dream was making Warcraft III Reforged free for all and issuing refunds), but I'm sure a dark Diablo IV was all a lot of people needed.



Blizzard confirms Diablo IV to open up BlizzCon 2019




(Update) Every character in Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm is currently free-to-play




(Update) It's finally time for the Warcraft III: Reforged beta




StarCraft II welcomes the villainous Arcturus Mengsk as next co-op commander




Sylvanas is back for better or worse for the new World of Warcraft expansion




Hearthstone: Descent of Dragons caps off the Year of the Dragon in December




Overwatch 2 confirmed at BlizzCon 2019, Echo is in




Sojourn is the other new arrival for Overwatch 2




All Overwatch progression and cosmetics come forward to Overwatch 2
