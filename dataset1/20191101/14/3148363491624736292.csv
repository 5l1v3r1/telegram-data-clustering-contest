Police are investigating the attack at a home in Orlinda, Calif., about 7 miles east of downtown Oakland. A neighbor told authorities the home was rented for the private party through Airbnb. The neighbor said as many as 50 people attended.
The gunfire injured multiple people, in addition to the four deaths, officials said.
Orlinda police and the Contra Costa County Sheriff’s Office are investigating the attack, but do not yet have a motive.
Orlinda was rated by Forbes magazine in 2012 as the second-most friendly town in the United States, and was formerly home to Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry.
“Orinda is supposed to be like a safe neighborhood. And this is what happened. I guess it is what it is,” the neighbor said.
