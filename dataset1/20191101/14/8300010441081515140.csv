They're amazing children in all kinds of fantastic ways.""Tuesday morning, the bodies of 11-year-old Parrish Auzenne, 9-year-old Eleanor Auzenne, and 7-year-old Lincoln Auzenne were found inside their home in the 1400-block of New Orleans Street.A family member asked police to do a welfare check on the family Tuesday, and that is when officers made the gruesome discovery.Investigators say a gun was found inside the home.The Harris County Medical Examiner's Office ruled Thursday that their deaths were a murder/suicide, with their 39-year-old mother, Ashley Auzenne, as the suspect.Court records show Ashley and Murvin Auzenne Jr. had just finalized their divorce last week.""The family has all rallied around my son, Murvin,"" said the elder Auzenne.
