《愛貓的終末照護》：停止積極治療就等於「見死不救」嗎？
01 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是有些飼主會認為停止積極治療等於「見死不救」，因而產生了罪惡感。然而，貓咪的病情時好時壞，不斷歷經這個過程後走向惡化的個案非常多。先暫停治療，透過安寧緩和療護讓基礎體力恢復之後，再展開治療也是一個方法。

獸醫師專欄：治療方針的抉擇時機

各種極限

即使被宣告寵物來日不多，只要有些微希望便想持續治療，此乃天下飼主心。獸醫師也會使出渾身解數，運用知識與醫術來進行治療。
即便如此，凡事都有極限。藥物的極限、貓咪體力的極限、致命副作用的可能性，以及飼主的體力或氣力、財力的極限等等。世上有多少貓，極限的類型就有多少，必須在某個時間點認清事實。
無法確認當事人（貓）本身意願的動物醫療，最終必須由飼主來做判斷，但這並非易事。
有些飼主會認為停止積極治療等於「見死不救」，因而產生了罪惡感。然而，貓咪的病情時好時壞，不斷歷經這個過程後走向惡化的個案非常多。先暫停治療，透過安寧緩和療護讓基礎體力恢復之後，再展開治療也是一個方法。
上醫院與治療的壓力消失後，貓咪的免疫力上升，進而恢復元氣，這樣的個案也時有所聞。
不要受到一時的情緒影響，應該針對貓咪當時的狀況、體能、疾病惡化速度等，從各種觀點、角度來思考並做出決定，會比較理想。

重視QOL的生活

所謂的QOL（Quality of Life）
是代表「生活品質」的縮寫。在人類的臨終期醫療上是很受重視的觀念，近年來在寵物醫療方面亦備受矚目。
透過安寧緩和療護來減輕病痛或苦楚，讓毛小孩能在安心的環境裡、在家人的陪伴下，順其自然地度過剩下的時間，是這個觀念所倡導的目的。雖然也會進行止瀉、止吐、補給水分、促進食欲等對症治療，不過其他時間大多是在家中安穩度過。
選擇重視QOL的生活以後，接下來便有賴飼主施展本領了。除了溫暖舒適的睡窩、好吃的餐點之外，飼主的雙手或聲音、體溫都能成為巨大的力量，為貓咪帶來撫慰。畢竟世上最了解毛小孩「開心」、「舒服」情緒的就只有飼主而已。不要覺得這項選擇是「見死不救」，請給貓咪滿滿的愛。

能與貓咪互動的時間

居家安寧緩和療護所帶來的不只是貓咪的安全感，還能讓飼主保有盡情與貓咪互動的時間。平時在外忙碌、有工作或家人得照顧等等，每個人都有各自的事情要做，儘管貓咪很可愛，但也不可能成天巴著不放。不過臨終期等同於能跟貓咪互動的最後時光，同時也是做好心理準備、面對分秒逼近之「最後時刻」的時期。
請盡可能多多撫摸貓咪，跟牠說說話，並將牠努力對抗病魔的模樣烙印在腦海裡。相信這將會是一段親密又寶貴的時光。

""End Care for Love Cats"": Stopping active treatment is equivalent to ""seeing death and not saving""?
01 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Summary


What we want you to know is that some owners will think that stopping active treatment is tantamount to ""seeing death and not saving"", thus creating a sense of guilt. However, the condition of the cat is good and bad, and there are many cases of deterioration after going through this process. It is also a method to suspend treatment and then restore the basic physical strength through tranquillity and palliative care.

Veterinary Officer Column: Timing of Treatment Policy

Various limits

Even if the pets are declared to be coming out of the day, as long as there is a slight hope that they want to continue treatment, this is the heart of the world. Veterinarians will also try their best to use knowledge and medicine to treat them.
Even so, everything has limits. The limits of the drug, the limits of the physical strength of the cat, the possibility of fatal side effects, and the physical or mental strength of the owner, the limits of financial resources, and so on. How many cats there are in the world, how many types of limits are there, and the facts must be recognized at some point in time.
It is not easy to determine the animal health care of the person (cat) itself, and ultimately it must be judged by the owner.
Some owners will think that stopping active treatment is equivalent to ""seeing death and not saving"", thus creating a sense of guilt. However, the condition of the cat is good and bad, and there are many cases of deterioration after going through this process. It is also a method to suspend treatment and then restore the basic physical strength through tranquillity and palliative care.
After the pressure on the hospital and treatment disappeared, the immunity of the cat increased and the vitality was restored. Such cases were also heard.
Don't be affected by the emotions of the moment. It should be ideal for thinking and making decisions from various viewpoints and perspectives on the cat's current situation, physical fitness, and the speed of disease deterioration.

Pay attention to the life of QOL

The so-called QOL (Quality of Life)
It is an abbreviation for ""quality of life."" In the end-stage medical treatment of human beings, it is highly valued. In recent years, it has also attracted attention in pet medical care.
It is the purpose advocated by this concept to relieve the pain or suffering through tranquillity and palliative care, so that the child can enjoy the rest of the time in a peaceful environment and accompanied by his family. Although symptomatic treatments such as diarrhea, antiemetics, replenishment of water, and appetite are also carried out, most of the other time is at home.
After choosing to focus on QOL's life, the next step is to rely on the owner to show his skills. In addition to warm and comfortable sleeping nests and delicious meals, the hands of the owner or the sound and body temperature can become a huge force, bringing comfort to the cat. After all, the only thing in the world that knows the ""happy"" and ""comfortable"" feelings of a child is only the owner. Don't think that this choice is ""Seeing death and not saving."" Please give the cat full love.

Time to interact with the cat

The home peace and tranquility treatment brings not only the safety of the cat, but also the time for the owner to interact with the cat. Usually busy outside, have a job or family to take care of, etc., everyone has their own things to do, although the cat is very cute, but it is impossible to stay in the sky. However, the end-of-life period is equivalent to the last time that can interact with the cat, and it is also the period of psychological preparation and the ""last moment"" of close-to-second approach.
Please touch the cat as much as possible, talk to it, and brand it to fight against the disease. I believe this will be an intimate and precious time.

What kind of help can the owner provide when there is little life left in the cat? - The answer lies in the time spent together.
The cat's end-of-life care needs are feed, medicine, sleeping, and... the hands, sounds, and care that have always been with it!
