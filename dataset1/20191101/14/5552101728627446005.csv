01 Nov 2019, 14:16 by 曹以斌
旗下擁有17 Media、Paktor拍拖、HandsUP直播電商等事業的M17集團，在營運轉盈之後，開始大規模向外併購，第一步就選擇了在亞太區經營的直播市場的MeMe直播，雖未透露併購金額，但M17宣布，此收購案一舉讓集團的直播業務在亞洲數國的市占突破60%。
「目前M17集團在亞太區，包括台灣、日本和香港的直播市場市佔率都已是第一名，我們接下來會更持續朝向整合全球直播市場、擴大新市場以及持續創新內容三大策略方向投入，而這次MeMe直播的加入，是讓我們達成目標的重大決定之一。」在宣布併購MeMe直播好消息的同時，M17集團共同創辦人暨執行長潘杰賢說。
為了快速讓集團成長並轉虧為盈，M17集團這兩年快速衝刺海外市場，先後在日本、美國與東南亞等市場落地生根，其中日本市場更是快速壯大，隨著獲利成績單出來之後，M17也決定向外併購擴張，這次吃下MeMe直播就是為了印度市場。
「我們非常高興能加入M17集團，M17在直播市場具有堅實的營運綜效跟內容整合應用，能提供MeMe在台灣、日本跟印度的商業夥伴更全面的服務。」MeMe直播CEO梁俊男說。

被併購的MeMe直播是由中國映客直播和遊戲開發商FunPlus共同創立，在2017年獲得映客與金沙江創投投資2,500萬美元（約新台幣7.5億元）A輪募資。身為「海外版映客」MeMe直播首站落地台灣，就是看上台灣音樂、偶像劇等「內容軟實力」。
雖然雙方興奮地宣佈這則好消息，但對於整個併購金額，以及未來雙方合併後的人員變動等問題都未提出解答，就以目前亞洲區直播業逐漸進入大者恆大的階段來看，M17吃下MeMe直播是否帶動新一波直播業併購潮，相當值得關注。
