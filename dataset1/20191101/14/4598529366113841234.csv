Don Young Nuzzles Camera While Avoiding Questions About Impeachment

01 Nov 2019, 14:36

Rather than answer the question at the center of the House’s impeachment inquiry, Rep. Don Young (R-AK)… nuzzled a videographer’s camera.
“There you go,” the congressman commented to the videographer, smiling.
Until that point, asked several times whether it’s appropriate for the President to ask a foreign government to interfere in American elections, Young just kept walking.
Maybe this is technically considered a “headbutt.” We report, you decide:



Young has a bit of a reputation for this kind of thing. Earlier this year, the congressman shoved Politico’s Melanie Zanona. He “told me to get out of his way ‘damnit’ as I was trying to interview another lawmaker,” Zanona recalled.
And few years ago, Young grabbed a congressional staffer’s arm on video. Then there’s the near folkloric tale of him holding a knife — the blade was closed — to the throat of then-House Speaker John Boehner. (Young tells the story here at 10:18.)
