Garver's tenants will showcase their products and services and offer deals, too. Expect to taste unique combinations such as ""sugar-beet"" flavored ice cream by Calliope Ice Cream and Garver-made NessAlla Kombucha cocktails.
Tenants include an event center, coffee roaster, florist, photography studio, spa, yoga studio, vegan cafe, and a distributor of sustainably-caught salmon.

The evening ends with live music from Gin Mill Hollow from 6-9 p.m.
