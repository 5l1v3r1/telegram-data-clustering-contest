《我要瘦下來》：更年期代謝下降，「一日三餐」的常識反而成為發胖主因
01 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是當代謝不停下降的期間，一天還是照常吃三餐的話，「IN」的部分會過量，也就是會過食，「一日三餐」的常識，可能成為「吃得和過去一樣多，但卻一直發胖」的原因之一。



文：木村容子、西澤實佳
改變飲食習慣，配合代謝下降的身體
即將面臨停經期的女性，要比其他時候更加留意飲食內容和食量，也就是注意「IN」的部分，同時也要注意排便，也就是「OUT」，否則體重會直線上升。
因此，關鍵在於必須質疑45歲之前的生活習慣，無論是飲食、排便或是睡眠，一直以來都深信不疑的「常識」。因為這些習以為常的「常識」，反而可能導致我們變成易胖體質。
當代謝不停下降的期間，一天還是照常吃三餐的話，「IN」的部分會過量，也就是會過食，以致於卡路里過多，有時將導致熱量攝取超標。「一日三餐」的常識，可能成為「吃得和過去一樣多，但卻一直發胖」的原因之一。
到了45歲之後，由於腸胃（脾）的機能會變差，因此會有很多人出現食物無法順利消化的情形。但是為了遵守「一天三餐」的原則，在上一餐食物尚未消化時，仍舊不間斷地將食物送進腸胃，老廢物質就無法順利排出，造成便秘等消化不適的症狀。
感覺餓了，再吃下一餐
江戶時代的知名儒學家，高齡84歲的貝原益軒，依據他的個人經驗以及從文書資料所學知識，將健康相關內容記載於《養生訓》一書中，針對飲食和消化的部分，留有下述這樣一段文字。
「假使早餐尚未消化，就不能吃午餐，也不能額外吃點心之類的零食。如果午餐還沒消化，就不能吃晚餐。當前天晚上的晚餐還滯留在體內，便不能享用早餐。想吃下一餐的時候，應減少一半分量，且須禁酒禁肉。」
總而言之，就是「只吃能夠消化的分量，待消化後再吃下一餐」。
規律的飲食，並不等於就是「一天吃三餐」。假如不知道自己到底有沒有吃太多時，可以先試著把晚餐減半，或是乾脆晚餐斷食，讓「食物不停歇地進入的腸胃」，回到歸零的狀態。
隔天起床後，先喝一杯溫開水，等到早上儀容打理好了之後，再吃早餐，然後確認接下來的排便情形；假如感覺「比平時來得順暢」的話，代表過去幾天的飲食分量，對你來說就是太多了，該試著調整。
「隱性便秘」可能是老化引起的
中醫在診斷身體不適時，視排便為一個重要項目，同時也不容輕忽排便對「中年發胖」的影響力。尤其是更年期前期的女性，隱性便秘恐怕就是中年發福的原因。
經過我多年的診察經驗，經常有45歲之後、面臨停經的女性患者向我反應，她們雖然還是每天都會排便，但是卻感覺排便後，肚子仍然覺得不太舒服，或是感覺腹部脹脹的，甚至於覺得好像有大便沒排乾淨。
這種情形就是因為肝功能失調，「氣」和「血」的循環變差，腹部才會容易覺得脹脹的；這種現象其實也算是一種便秘。由於每天還是會排便，因此我稱之為隱性便秘。有隱性便秘困擾的人，通常身材都是小腹突出的洋梨蘋果型身材，在腹部的周圍囤積了許多內臟脂肪。
更年期前期容易發生隱性便秘，推測有以下原因，對女性而言，最明顯的原因就是這時期女性荷爾蒙會急速減少，一旦女性荷爾蒙分泌量下降，自律神經的運作就會失常；而自律神經失調，也會對腸道蠕動造成影響，腸道蠕動是為了使消化後的食物在腸道內移動，將糞便排出體外，當蠕動狀況不佳，就容易發生便秘。
此外，隨著年齡增加，肌肉量減少，內臟不斷下垂，排便力也會減弱，這一點也是形成隱性便秘的原因之一。
以中醫的角度來說，和自律神經有關的五臟是肝。肝儲存著「血」（血液），且能掌控「氣」（能量）循環、並維持順暢，因此改善肝的機能，就有助於改善隱性便秘。為了提高肝的機能、改善排便，建議各位可以用以下的呼吸法，同時刺激腹部的穴道。

仰躺姿勢，一邊吐氣，一邊用食指、中指與無名指的指腹，依序輕壓中脘、右大巨、右天樞、左天樞、左大巨（見下圖）。
接下來，將雙手重疊放在腹部，用力吸氣，感覺雙手疊放的部位鼓起來。此時用手一邊感覺腹部鼓起來的感覺，一邊稍微用力下壓。
將手的位置，依序從上腹部往下腹部、右腹部、左腹部、肚臍方向移動，同時平均施力。

更年期前期導致隱性便秘的原因，和其他年齡層一樣，可能是出在缺乏食物纖維，或是腸道壞菌比好菌多、腸內環境不理想等因素。想要攝取有效改善便秘的食物纖維，蔬菜是不錯的選擇。
不過，一天當中吃得下的蔬菜分量，畢竟還是有限，其實在糙米和裸麥麵包等食物當中，也富含許多食物纖維，除此之外，豆類、海藻類及蕈菇類等食物，也都能攝取到食物纖維。從各種食物中補充每天足夠的膳食纖維，避免偏食，是每一個年齡都必須注意的。
有助於改善腸道環境的食物，還有優格，如果能和具有活化好菌運作的寡糖和蜂蜜一同食用，效果會更加明顯。
45歲之後，在排便習慣方面，除了「能排便、能規律排便」之外，請大家還要留意「排便後的感覺是否舒暢」。
晚上睡不好的話，改成早上洗澡
進入更年期前期之後，就算日常生活的步調和往常一樣，可是感到容易疲累的時候會漸漸增加。
為了向患者說明常常容易累的原因，我將能量（氣）的總量用球來做比喻，也就是「能量球理論」。簡單來說，容易疲勞的原因，就是隨著年齡增長，能量的總量會減少，而且身體為了調整荷爾蒙平衡，會使用更多的能量，因此每人每天實際可使用的能量也會隨之減少。
但是，我們很難發現體內的能量球變小（總量變少），還有當中的空氣（能量）也減少了。尤其在年輕時不容易感到累、或是稍微休息一下就能恢復元氣的人，更難以發現這點。
對這套理論沒有概念的患者，經常聽到他們反應，在傍晚到晚上的這段時間特別容易覺得累，因此常會在晚餐過後小睡一下，醒來是深夜，接著才去洗澡，然後再繼續睡。
例如，從晚上8點開始睡了2小時，到晚上10點醒來，直到凌晨3點，中間可能看書或上網，洗完澡後發現天還沒亮，於是就回頭去睡，然後在早上7點起床，總計共睡了6小時。
但是這樣斷斷續續的睡眠，無法讓深層睡眠與淺層睡眠順利切換，這樣一來，五臟中的肝機能會運作不順、發生異常，也就是會干擾自律神經的運作。而就如前文所提到的，自律神經失調會讓人更容易發胖。
與連續睡6小時的人相比之下，斷斷續續睡6小時的人睡眠品質較差，結果和熬夜的人一樣，這樣的生活習慣會容易發胖。
洗澡的時候也需要能量，如果能量（氣）不足，不如直接先睡覺來補「氣」吧！感覺很睏的時候就不要洗澡，乾脆直接睡覺、而不要想著小睡一下，然後隔天早一點起床洗澡，這樣才能有一整段完整的睡眠時間，達到「優質睡眠」。
年過45歲之後，要隨著身體的狀況調整過去的生活步調，不要受限於習慣或常識，例如一日要吃三餐，或是要洗完澡才睡覺，隨機應變過生活，才能讓身體達到最好的循環狀態。
45~55歲（更年期前期）的自我保養重點！   •  跳脫「一日三餐」的常識，不覺得餓時，可以少吃一餐。   •  除了定時排便之外，也要注意排便的品質。   •  真的很累的時候，早早睡覺，第二天起來再洗澡。

""I want to slim down"": Metabolic decline in menopause, the common sense of ""three meals a day"" becomes the main cause of fat
01 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Summary


What we want you to know is that when the metabolism continues to drop, if you eat three meals a day, the ""IN"" part will be overdose, that is, it will overeating. The common sense of ""three meals a day"" may become ""eaten."" One of the reasons why there are as many as in the past, but it has always been fat.



Text: Kimura Yoshiko, Nishizawa Shika
Change your eating habits and match your body with decreased metabolism
Women who are about to face menopause should pay more attention to dietary content and food intake than other times, that is, pay attention to the ""IN"" part, and also pay attention to bowel movements, that is, ""OUT"", otherwise the weight will rise linearly.
Therefore, the key is to question the living habits before the age of 45, whether it is diet, defecation or sleep, has always been convinced of ""common sense."" Because of these common ""common senses"", it may lead us to become fat and physique.
When the metabolism continues to decline, if you eat three meals a day, the ""IN"" part will be excessive, that is, it will overeating, so that too many calories will sometimes lead to excessive calorie intake. The common sense of ""three meals a day"" may be one of the reasons why ""eat as much as in the past, but it has always gained weight.""
After the age of 45, because the function of the stomach (spleen) will deteriorate, there will be many people who cannot easily digest food. However, in order to comply with the principle of ""three meals a day"", when the food of the last meal has not been digested, the food is still sent to the stomach without interruption, and the old waste materials cannot be discharged smoothly, causing symptoms such as constipation and digestive discomfort.
Feeling hungry, eat another meal
A well-known Confucian scholar in the Edo period, 84-year-old Bei Yuan Yi Xuan, based on his personal experience and knowledge from the clerical materials, recorded health-related content in the book ""Health Training"", focusing on the diet and digestion. There is a paragraph like this.
""If the breakfast has not been digested, you can't eat lunch, and you can't eat snacks like snacks. If you haven't digested lunch, you can't eat dinner. The dinner at the current night is still in the body, you can't enjoy breakfast. Want to eat When you eat a meal, you should reduce the amount by half, and you must ban the meat and ban meat.""
All in all, it is ""only eat the amount that can be digested, and then eat the next meal after digestion.""
A regular diet does not mean ""three meals a day."" If you don't know if you have eaten too much, you can try to cut the dinner by half, or simply cut off the dinner and let the ""food keep entering the stomach"" and return to the zero state.
After getting up the next day, first drink a cup of warm water, wait until the morning to take care of it, then eat breakfast, and then confirm the next defecation situation; if you feel ""smooth than usual"", it represents the weight of the diet in the past few days, It is too much for you, so try to adjust.
""hidden constipation"" may be caused by aging
In the diagnosis of physical discomfort, Chinese medicine practitioners regard bowel movements as an important item, and at the same time, they should not neglect the influence of defecation on ""middle-age fat."" Especially for women in the early menopause, recessive constipation is probably the reason for the middle-aged blessing.
After many years of experience in my examination, I often responded to women who were menopausal after the age of 45. Although they still defecate every day, they still feel uncomfortable after bowel movements, or feel abdominal swelling. I even felt that there was no stool clean.
This situation is due to liver dysfunction, the cycle of ""qi"" and ""blood"" is worse, the abdomen will easily feel swollen; this phenomenon is actually a constipation. Because I still have bowel movements every day, I call it hidden constipation. People who are troubled by recessive constipation usually have a pear-shaped apple-shaped figure with a small belly and hoarding a lot of visceral fat around the abdomen.
In the early stage of menopause, it is prone to hidden constipation. It is speculated that for the following reasons, the most obvious reason for women is that female hormones will decrease rapidly during this period. Once the female hormone secretion decreases, the operation of autonomic nerves will be abnormal; and autonomic nervous disorders It also affects the intestinal peristalsis. The intestinal peristalsis is to move the digested food in the intestines and excrete the feces. When the peristaltic condition is not good, constipation is prone to occur.
In addition, as the age increases, the muscle mass decreases, the internal organs continue to sag, and the defecation force is also weakened. This is also one of the reasons for the formation of hidden constipation.
From the perspective of Chinese medicine, the five internal organs associated with autonomic nerves are the liver. The liver stores ""blood"" (blood) and can control the circulation of ""qi"" (energy) and maintain smoothness. Therefore, improving liver function can help to improve hidden constipation. In order to improve the function of the liver and improve bowel movements, it is recommended that you use the following breathing methods to stimulate the acupuncture points in the abdomen.

While lying on your back, exhale, while using the index finger, middle finger and ring finger, gently press the middle, right big, right Tianshu, Zuo Tianshu, Zuo Daju (see the picture below).
Next, put your hands on the abdomen, inhale, and feel the parts of your hands bulging. At this time, I feel the feeling of abdomen bulging by hand, and press it with a little force.
Move the position of the hand from the upper abdomen to the lower abdomen, the right abdomen, the left abdomen, and the navel, and apply the force equally.

The causes of latent constipation in the early menopause, like other age groups, may be due to lack of dietary fiber, or poor intestinal bacteria than good bacteria, and unsatisfactory intestinal environment. Vegetables are a good choice if you want to take in dietary fiber that is effective in improving constipation.
However, the amount of vegetables that can be eaten during the day is still limited. In fact, foods such as brown rice and rye bread are also rich in dietary fiber. In addition, foods such as beans, seaweeds and oyster mushrooms are also Both can consume dietary fiber. It is a must to pay attention to every age to supplement enough dietary fiber from various foods to avoid partial eclipse.
Foods that help improve the intestinal environment, as well as Yogurt, will be more effective if they are eaten with oligosaccharides and honey that have activated bacteria.
After the age of 45, in addition to ""can defecate and regular bowel movements"", please pay attention to ""whether the feeling after defecation is comfortable"".
If you can’t sleep well at night, change to a morning bath.
After entering the pre-menopause period, even if the pace of daily life is the same as usual, it will gradually increase when you feel tired.
In order to explain to the patient why it is often easy to get tired, I use the ball as a metaphor for the total amount of energy (gas), which is the ""energy ball theory."" In short, the reason for fatigue is that as you age, the total amount of energy decreases, and the body uses more energy to adjust the hormonal balance, so the actual energy available per person per day is also reduced. .
However, it is difficult to find that the energy sphere in the body becomes smaller (the total amount becomes less), and the air (energy) in it is also reduced. Especially when you are young, you don't feel tired, or you can recover with a little rest. It's even harder to find this.
Patients who have no concept of this theory often hear their reactions. They are particularly tired during the evening to night. Therefore, they often take a nap after dinner, wake up late at night, then take a bath and then continue to sleep.
For example, I slept for 2 hours from 8 pm and woke up at 10 pm until 3 am, and I might read a book or go online. After the shower, I found that the day was still not bright, so I went back to sleep, and then in the morning 7 I got up and slept for a total of 6 hours.
However, such intermittent sleep can not smoothly switch between deep sleep and shallow sleep, so that the liver function in the five internal organs will not work properly and abnormality, that is, it will interfere with the operation of the autonomic nerve. And as mentioned earlier, autonomic nervous disorders make people more likely to gain weight.
Compared with people who sleep for 6 hours in a row, people who sleep 6 hours intermittently have poor sleep quality. As a result, like a person who stays up late, such a habit can easily gain weight.
Energy is also needed when taking a bath. If the energy (gas) is insufficient, it is better to sleep directly to make up the qi! When you feel very sleepy, don't take a bath, just go to sleep directly, instead of thinking about taking a nap, then get up early every morning to take a bath, so that you can have a full sleep time to achieve ""quality sleep.""
After the age of 45, you should adjust your past life pace with your physical condition. Don't be restricted by habits or common sense. For example, if you want to eat three meals a day, or take a shower to sleep, you can adapt your life to the body. Achieve the best cycle state.
Self-maintenance focus of 45~55 years old (pre-menopause)! • Get rid of the common sense of “three meals a day”. If you don’t feel hungry, you can eat less. • In addition to regular bowel movements, pay attention to the quality of bowel movements. • When you are really tired, go to bed early and take a shower the next day.
