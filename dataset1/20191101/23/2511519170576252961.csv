“The JFF must give as much support as we can during this time of bereavement to her mother and close friends.”
The JFF tweeted: “The JFF mourns the loss of Tarania Clarke who was injured and sadly passed away last night having succumbed to her injuries.
“We express our deepest condolences to her family and friends during this very challenging time. Jamaica’s female football suffers a significant loss as she was a very talented player.”
