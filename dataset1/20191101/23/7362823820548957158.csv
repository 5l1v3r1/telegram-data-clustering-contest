He continued: ""It has also been my honor to work with some of the brightest minds in television daytime: Mark Goodson, Merrill Heater, and I would put Harry Friedman in that company as well. He's always pushing the envelope, he's very imaginative, he works hard to stay ahead of the game.""
Friedman first became a producer for ""Fortune"" in 1995, then took the same role on ""Jeopardy!"" in 1997. He has been an executive producer on both shows since 1999.

""I wish I had known sooner that the persistent stomach pain I experienced prior to my diagnosis was a symptom of pancreatic cancer,” he said in the minute-long video. “Other common symptoms can include mid-back pain, unexplained weight loss, new on-set diabetes and the yellowing of the skin or eyes.”
Trebek also recently said that his battle with pancreatic cancer could lead to him leaving ""Jeopardy!"" which he has hosted since 1984.
