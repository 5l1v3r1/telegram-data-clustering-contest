【悠活臺南】金曲歌王謝銘祐　遊翔故鄉　唱人生ㄟ歌
01 Nov 2019, 23:13 by 賴智揚
今年臺灣文博會臺南館，以「文文仔火」溫火慢煮的意涵，貼切形容臺南人看待時間的方式和處事態度，也藉由謝銘祐帶有故事感的嗓音，搭起觀展人與臺南特色文化間的橋梁。看著一疊疊歌詞手稿，彷彿窺見這位歌王如何嘔心瀝血、寫下動人樂章；歌王說，他才是窺探這座城市的人，歌曲都是對所見所聞的紀錄。
8月中旬，南臺灣清晨一場暴雨襲擊，許多機關單位一早就公布停班的消息。這天，謝銘祐的「麵包車樂團」預計到歸仁安養中心義演，原以為也會喊停，沒想到樂團不畏風雨依約前往，照著既定安排，為安養中心的老人們唱了十幾首歌曲，除了開場應景唱了2首和雨有關的歌，接下來的表演全配合長輩們的年代，有思念的、熱鬧的，也有飽含情愫的歌曲，雖看不出台下孱弱的長輩們反應如何，但臺上的謝銘祐和樂團夥伴可是越唱越起勁。


謝銘祐帶有故事感的特殊嗓音，配上一把吉他就能盡情唱他心中的臺南。

　
無償義演　曲中找自我
到醫療院所、老人安養院表演，對謝銘祐的「麵包車樂團」已不是新鮮事，走遍各鄉鎮，唱了1千多場，有些安養院甚至去過好幾回。謝銘祐說，只要收到邀請，他們就會將這些預訂排進行程，而且全是義演，經費就從平時表演募款籌措，所以樂團成員加入的首要條件，就是需有正職工作，得先養活自己，再撥空來演出。


至安養院演出全是義演，經費由平時表演募款籌措，就連代步車輛也是朋友捐贈。

十幾年來持續不斷，只要有時間、有經費，「麵包車樂團」就出門為這些「資深」聽眾唱歌。問他是在做公益事業嗎？他笑稱他們才是獲得最多的人，從這些長者們身上，他們找到了自己的舞台。這些長輩們窮極一生付出努力，卻少有音樂是專門唱給他們聽的，謝銘祐乾脆專注研究那個時代，聽長輩們說故事，還為他們量身訂做歌曲，這大概也是臺灣音樂界的創舉—以「熟齡市場」做為主打聽眾。


4人組成的「麵包車樂團」像是臺南「披頭四樂團」（The Beatles），風靡各大安養院，演出邀約多到排不進行程。

他總是在做和別人不一樣的事，2013年，謝銘祐以臺南為主題，製作了與城市同名的專輯《台南》，內容包含臺南的人文、地景，寫臺南人的生活節奏與習慣，編曲一反過去磅礡大作，沒有聲勢浩大管弦樂，單用一把吉他就盡情唱他心中的臺南，沒想到這張專輯竟讓謝銘祐一舉奪下第24屆金曲獎的「最佳台語專輯」及「最佳男歌手」。

謝銘祐說，臺南是要住下來，才能感受到它的模樣。返鄉13年，他慢慢整理出自己對創作的態度，寫歌記錄自己窺探世界、聽完別人故事後的感受，也用滄桑嗓音，唱出自己對臺南的濃濃情感。
謝銘祐的創作歌曲〈行〉，可說是他對臺南情感的最佳註解，看得出他感情豐沛，寫歌時全心投入，讓自己像專業演員一樣進入角色，也曾因過於投入，一度走不出來。寫〈金小姐〉這首歌時，謝銘祐就想像自己是個女人如何失去自我，愛人卻離去，杳無音訊，太過入戲無力脫身的情緒久久無法平復，相當危險，但寫出的作品也更能打動人心。
行 沿路行 行 慢慢行
經過少年的囝仔伴
嘛經過失戀的亭仔跤
擱行 繼續行
直直的 彎曲的 看無尾的人生
鬧熱的 寂寞的 無閒趕路的面
時間伊 毋捌停
——節錄自歌曲〈行〉，收錄於專輯《台南》
　
走出低潮　為土地發聲
謝銘祐創作的流行歌曲超過2千首，天王、天后的專輯都曾邀他寫歌，90年代的作品更是散見於當紅歌手的專輯中，寫歌成了隨手拈來，照著公式就能產出1首，寫到後來都麻木了，甚至質疑自己是否該繼續創作，陷入低潮的他罹患憂鬱症，生活足不出戶，整整1年不再寫歌。

現在回頭看那段經歷，仍舊感到驚心，不僅高潮迭起、峰迴路轉，再慢慢回歸平穩，這些歷程也讓他更加珍惜返回故鄉重新開始的生活。謝銘祐從在地尋找靈感創作，也到社區大學擔任講師，以安平特有風聲命名舉辦「南吼音樂季」，聚集周邊資源，靠著在廟口說書演唱的「小南吼」，賺取打賞金籌措經費；也在安平與文史工作者們一同推動「風獅爺復育計畫」，無償提供居民挑選適合的風獅爺裝上自家屋頂，在東北季風來臨時能發出呼呼的吼聲，重現故鄉風情。

謝銘祐與文史工作者們在安平推動「風獅爺復育計畫」，由藝術家帶領志工創作捏製造型奇特的風獅爺。


5歲就搬到臺南安平，30歲北漂後返鄉，現在50歲了，他持續賣力為這片土地發聲、辦活動，謝銘祐用自己熱愛的音樂，傳誦對臺南的情感，也讓聽見這些歌聲的人，從飽含在地生活紀錄的詞句中，編織出臺南首府萬象。

[Yuhuai Tainan] Jinqu song Wang Xie Mingyou You Xiang’s hometown singing life songs
01 Nov 2019, 23:13 by Lai Zhiyang
This year, the Taiwanese Cultural Fair’s Tainan Pavilion, with the meaning of “Wen Wen Zi Huo” cooking slowly, describes the way in which Tainan people see time and their attitudes, and also sets up the audience by Xie Mingyou’s voice with a sense of story. A bridge between Tainan's distinctive culture. Looking at a stack of lyrics manuscripts, it seems to glimpse how the song king sighs and writes moving movements; the song king said that he is the person who spies on the city, the songs are records of what you see and hear.
In mid-August, a heavy rainstorm hit southern Taiwan in the early morning, and many government agencies announced the news of the suspension. On this day, Xie Mingyou's ""Vehicle Orchestra"" is expected to go to the Guiren Anyang Center for a charity performance. I thought it would stop. I didn't expect the orchestra to go to the wind and rain, and sang for the old people of the Anyang Center according to the established arrangements. A few songs, in addition to the opening scene, sang two songs related to the rain, the next performances are all in line with the ages of the elders, there are missing, lively, and full of affectionate songs, although they do not see the elders who are weak. How the reaction is, but the Xie Mingyou and the orchestra partner on the stage are more and more singer.


Xie Mingyou has a special voice with a sense of story, and with a guitar, he can sing Tainan in his heart.


Find yourself in the free play
Going to the medical institution and the elderly nursing home, it is not new to Xie Mingyou's ""Baker's Orchestra"". He has traveled to towns and towns and sang more than 1,000 games. Some nursing homes have even been there several times. Xie Mingyou said that as long as they receive the invitation, they will schedule these reservations, and they will all perform the performances. The funds will be raised from the usual performances. Therefore, the first condition for the members of the orchestra to join is to have a full-time job and to support themselves first. Then dial the air to perform.


The performances to the Anyangyuan are all performances. The funds are raised from the usual performances, and even the vehicles are donated by friends.

For more than a decade, as long as there is time and money, the ""Bakery Orchestra"" will go out to sing for these ""senior"" listeners. Asked if he is doing a public welfare undertaking? He laughed and said that they were the most people. From these elders, they found their own stage. These elders worked hard for a lifetime, but few of them sang to them. Xie Mingyou simply focused on studying that era, listening to the elders telling stories, and tailoring songs for them. This is probably the pioneering work of Taiwanese music industry. - Focusing on the ""cooked market"".


The four-person ""Baker's Orchestra"" is like the ""The Beatles"" in Tainan. It is popular in major nursing homes.

He is always doing something different from others. In 2013, Xie Mingyou used the theme of Tainan to produce the album ""Tainan"" with the same name as the city. The content includes the humanities and landscapes of Tainan, and the rhythm and habits of Tainan people. Arranging the music in the past, there is no great orchestral music, just use a guitar to sing his heart Tainan, I did not expect this album to let Xie Mingyou win the 24th Golden Melody Award for ""Best Taiwanese album"" And ""Best Male Singer"".

Xie Mingyou said that Tainan is going to live and feel its appearance. After returning to his hometown for 13 years, he slowly sorted out his attitude towards creation, wrote songs to record his own feelings after prying into the world, listening to other people's stories, and sang his deep affection for Tainan.
Xie Mingyou's song ""Journey"" can be said to be his best annotation of Tainan's emotions. He can see that he has a lot of emotions. When he writes songs, he is fully engaged and let himself enter the role like a professional actor. Can't walk out. When writing the song ""Miss Jin"", Xie Mingyou imagined how he was a woman who lost himself. The lover left, there was no news. The emotion of being too incapable of getting out of the drama could not be calmed for a long time. It was quite dangerous, but the works written were also more Can touch people's hearts.
Line along the road, go slowly
After the juvenile
Well, after the love of the pavilion
Hold on
Straight, curved, looking tailless life
Lonely, lonely, no-going
Time 毋捌 stop
- Excerpted from the song ""Line"", included in the album ""Tainan""

Out of the low tide, vocalize the land
Xie Mingyou has created more than 2,000 popular songs. The albums of Tianwang and Tianhou have invited him to write songs. The works of the 90s are scattered on the albums of popular singers. The songs are written and can be produced according to the formula. One out of the book, after writing it was numb, and even questioned whether he should continue to create, he fell into a low tide, he suffered from depression, lived without leaving home, and did not write songs for a whole year.


In 2013, Xie Mingyou founded the “Nanjing Music Season” under the name of Anping's unique wind. (Provided by Li Yiyang)

Looking back at that experience, I am still shocked. Not only did the climax rise, the peaks and turns, but slowly returned to stability. These experiences also made him cherish the life that he returned to his hometown. Xie Mingyou was looking for inspiration from the local area, and also as a lecturer at the community college. He named the ""Nanxun Music Season"" with the name of Anping. He gathered the surrounding resources and earned a reward for the rewards by relying on the ""Small Nanxun"" sung in the temple. Funding; also promoted the ""Wind Lions Rehabilitation Project"" together with Anthony and the cultural and historical workers, and provided the residents with suitable wind lions to install their own roofs, and the buzzing sounds of the northeast monsoon can be reappeared. Hometown style.

Xie Mingyou and the literary and historical workers promoted the ""Feng Shiye Rehabilitation Project"" in Anping, and the artist led the volunteers to create a unique style of the wind lion.


When I was 5 years old, I moved to Anping, Tainan. After I was 30 years old, I returned to my hometown. Now I am 50 years old. He continues to work hard to make sounds and activities for this land. Xie Mingyou uses his favorite music to convey the feelings of Tainan and let them hear these. The singer of the song, weaving the Vientiane of Tainan’s capital from the words of life record.
