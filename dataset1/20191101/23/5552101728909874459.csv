01 Nov 2019, 23:58 by 莊琇閔, 攝影組
2016年12月，台南市北安路加油站後方樹叢，發現一具套頭女屍，警方根據死者身上的百貨店會員卡及3張發票，查出死者是47歲的魏敏樺，凶手則是大她17歲的男友梁文約。梁不但有家室，也已經當阿公，卻因死者打算結束不倫黃昏戀，盛怒殺人。梁最後遭判刑17年定讞，只能在獄中度過晚年。



台南市北安路加油站後方樹叢少有民眾經過，2016年12月26日下午3時許，1名楊姓男子到附近的宮廟拜拜，路過樹叢時，隱約看到裡面有東西，周邊聚集不少蒼蠅。楊男起初不以為意，但拜拜之後覺得不對勁，再騎腳踏車前往查看，結果瞥見一隻發黑的手，嚇得趕緊報案。
　
兵分南北　調影像緝凶
時任台南市警局第三分局偵查隊長的蔡宗憲回憶，死者是一名中年女子，陳屍在加油站圍牆後方的水溝內，衣著完整，頭部被套上黑色塑膠袋，並以膠帶封口，腿部蓋有一件黑色外套。由於屍體已發黑腫脹，警方研判死亡多日。另外，地上有長長的拖曳痕跡，警方因此懷疑陳屍處不是犯案的第一現場。
警方在死者身上找到一張百貨店的會員卡，與3張6天前在台北市北投區住宿及購物的發票，一方面向發行會員卡的業者查詢申辦人身分，也請北投警方向旅館調閱監視器、調查住宿者。

北投警方根據發票時間，調到前往投宿的一對男女影像與汽車車牌號碼，台南警方也查出會員卡申辦人為魏敏樺。員警前往魏家詢問，家屬表示她一週前與梁姓男友外出後就未回家，沒有任何音訊，最後也確認死者就是魏女。
警方根據魏女家屬提供的資料，前往魏女的男友梁文約位於台南永康的住處，梁男見警方上門，低聲說：「我會配合，請不要打擾我家人。」隨即向妻子表示晚上不會回家，睡前記得將門窗上鎖，就隨同警方到分局接受偵訊。
蔡宗憲說，梁文約看了他與魏敏樺出入旅館的畫面，立即坦承自己殺了魏。梁告訴警方，他與魏在12月20日開車到台北，入住北投的溫泉旅館，隔天又去九份，過了中午才啟程準備返回台南。
途中，魏女以「父親要動手術」為由，要梁文約給她15萬元，梁拒絕，魏則回應：「你若不願意，還有人願意照顧我。」魏揚言分手，2人因而起了口角，梁為了安撫魏，從上衣口袋取出一顆由醫院開立的抗焦慮藥給魏，魏知道該藥有助眠效果，自行吞服，不久後就睡著了。
　
下藥迷昏　查通訊紀錄
梁文約為避免再起口角，趁魏入睡時，將口袋內全部的抗焦慮藥倒入魏的杯裝果汁內。下午3時，梁駕車進入關西服務區上廁所，魏醒來後又在車上喝下三分之二杯果汁。梁返回車內時，發現魏已昏睡，趁機查看魏的手機，結果在LINE聊天室發現魏與另一名男子出遊的證據。



梁男趁魏女昏睡時，察看其手機，發現她與其他異性來往，十分氣憤。



魏女喝下摻有鎮靜劑的果汁，無力反抗，慘遭梁男掐斃。


梁文約自覺被欺騙，憤而以右手勾住魏女頸部，並以左手掐住魏的喉嚨，魏因服下大量藥物，無力反抗，僅伸手抓住梁的左手腕，並發出氣音。梁見狀持續用力，直到魏無聲息後才罷手。隨後，梁取出平時摘草藥用的黑色塑膠袋，套住魏的頭部，再以透明膠帶在其頸部纏繞數圈，並將自己的棒球帽戴在魏頭上，再將她的化妝品、衣服、皮包丟棄於關西服務區的垃圾桶，才啟程前往台南。
梁文約向警方表示，自己殺了魏女後，很後悔也很慌亂，因此駕車回台南後，就想找個不易被人發現的地方棄屍。他下交流道後開車亂繞，看到加油站後方有一片樹叢，認為是個隱密的地點，因此將魏的屍體丟在該處。

外遇慣犯　妻淡然以對
梁文約雖然配合偵訊、承認犯行，但當晚警方要將他關到拘留所時，他卻激動拒絕，員警詢問，他才說出掐死魏女時，被她眼睛突出的模樣嚇到，返家幾天以來，只要一閉上眼睛，腦中就會浮現魏死時的慘狀。警方告知會有員警與他一起留在拘留所內，不會讓他獨處，他才願意入所。

隔天親友看到新聞打電話關心，梁妻才知道丈夫犯下殺人案，因梁文約從年輕時就是外遇慣犯，梁妻接到親友的關心電話，也只淡淡表示：「個人造業個人擔！我不會管他在外頭的事情了。」
當時64歲的梁文約與妻子育有4名子女，不過梁一直有外遇，梁妻的心境也從氣憤轉為淡然。對於丈夫外遇，梁妻曾想找小三理論，但為了孩子，她決定嚥下這口怨氣；大兒子也曾經想要抓姦，最後失敗收場，梁妻和子女討論後，決定從此不理會梁男，沒想到居然會發生命案。

由於梁文約經常不回家，他這次到台北遊玩，妻子完全不以為意，但梁回家後卻沉默寡言，完全不和家人互動，像是變了一個人，還和小兒子討論死後樹葬的問題。
直到警方把梁文約帶走隔天，梁妻接到親友電話關心，才知道丈夫殺死小三，4名子女聞訊也紛紛趕回家安慰母親，但梁妻泰然地說：「我早就看淡了，心裡沒有恨了，哪會擔心？」
　
家人勸分　遭電話恐嚇
至於死者魏敏樺已離婚，帶著一對子女生活，案發前2年，她在按摩店工作認識梁文約，2人進一步交往成為男女朋友。梁一開始表示會給魏生活費，魏也辭去按摩店工作，到檳榔攤上班。
魏女家屬告訴警方，梁文約的占有欲很強，2人交往一年後，魏女家人得知梁已婚，勸她不要再與梁交往，梁還因此多次打電話恐嚇魏女家人，並要魏跟家人斷絕關係，更會檢查魏的通訊內容，以致魏與家人關係疏遠。

魏女的姊姊說，梁文約與魏交往期間，曾允諾每月給生活費，還說要買車、房給她，甚至要幫忙還債，但除了剛開始有給生活費，其他全部跳票，根本是愛情騙子。後來魏因父親罹患重病，返家與父親同住、照料，她離家時正好父親要開刀，手術結束後她還打電話關心，沒想到竟成了最後一通電話。
針對這起命案，法院最後依殺人及遺棄屍體罪，將梁文約判刑17年定讞，此外還須賠償700萬元給魏女的父親及子女。一場不倫黃昏之戀，奪走一條人命，六十多歲的凶手，只能在獄中度過晚年。

In December 2016, the rear of the gas station in Bei'an Road, Tainan City, found a corpse of female corpses. According to the department store membership card and 3 invoices on the deceased, the police found that the deceased was 47-year-old Wei Minhua and the murderer was 17 years old. Boyfriend Liang Wenjo. Liang not only has a family, but also has become a public, but because the deceased intends to end the love of the twilight, anger and murder. Liang was finally sentenced to 17 years in prison and can only spend his late years in prison.



There are few people passing by the bushes at the back of the gas station in Bei'an Road, Tainan City. At 3 pm on December 26, 2016, a man named Yang surnamed the nearby temple to worship. When passing by the trees, he saw something inside and gathered around. A lot of flies. Yang Nan didn't take it for granted at first, but after he got down, he felt that something was wrong. He then took a bicycle to check it. As a result, he saw a black hand and was scared to report the case.

The soldiers are divided into the north and the south.
At the time, Cai Zongxian, the investigative team leader of the Third Branch of the Tainan Police Station, recalled that the deceased was a middle-aged woman.

The cover has a black jacket. The police have been sentenced to death for many days because the body has been black and swollen. In addition, there are long traces of towing on the ground, and the police suspect that the corpse is not the first scene of the crime.
The police found a membership card for the department store on the deceased, and three invoices for accommodation and shopping in Beitou District, Taipei 6 days ago. On the one hand, the applicants who issued the membership card were asked about the identity of the bidder. Access to monitors and survey visitors.


The police found the murderer's car number based on the invoices left on the deceased, and then controlled the driving trajectory. (provided by the police)

According to the invoice time, Beitou police transferred a pair of male and female images and car license plate numbers to the hotel. The Tainan police also found out that the membership card sponsor was Wei Minhua. The police went to the Wei family to inquire. The family said that she did not return home after she went out with her boyfriend Liang, a week ago. There was no news. Finally, the deceased was confirmed to be Wei.
According to the information provided by Wei’s family, the police went to Wei’s boyfriend Liang Wen’s residence in Yongkang, Tainan. Liang Nan saw the police coming to the door and whispered, “I will cooperate, please don’t bother my family.” Then he said to his wife at night. Will not go home, remember to lock the doors and windows before going to bed, and accompany the police to the branch to accept the investigation.
Cai Zongxian said that Liang Weng saw the picture of him and Wei Minhua entering the hotel and immediately admitted that he had killed Wei. Liang told the police that he and Wei drove to Taipei on December 20, stayed at the hot spring hotel in Beitou, and went to Jiufen the next day. After noon, they set off to return to Tainan.
On the way, Wei woman asked Liang Wen to give her 150,000 yuan on the grounds that her father had to operate. Liang refused. Wei responded: ""If you don't want to, someone will take care of me."" Wei Yangyan broke up, 2 people Therefore, in order to appease Wei, Liang took out an anxiolytic medicine opened by the hospital from the jacket pocket to Wei, Wei knew that the drug had a sleep aid effect, swallowed it himself, and soon fell asleep.

Drug fainting
Liang Wen is about to avoid another whistle. When Wei falls asleep, pour all the anti-anxiety medicines in his pocket into Wei's cup of juice. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, Liang drove into the Kansai service area to go to the toilet. After Wei woke up, he drank two-thirds of the juice in the car. When the beam returned to the car, it was found that Wei had fallen asleep and took the opportunity to check Wei’s mobile phone. As a result, evidence of Wei’s travel with another man was found in the LINE chat room.



When Liang Niu Wei Wei was sleeping, she looked at her mobile phone and found that she was very angry with other opposite sex.



Wei female drank the juice mixed with sedatives, unable to resist, and was mourned by Liang.


Liang Wenju was consciously deceived. He was angered and hooked Wei's neck with his right hand. He held Wei's throat with his left hand. Wei took a lot of drugs and couldn't resist. He only reached out and grabbed the left wrist of the beam and made a gas sound. The beam saw the force continue until the Wei did not sound. Subsequently, the beam was taken out of a black plastic bag for picking herbs, wrapped around Wei's head, and then wrapped around a few times with a scotch tape on his neck, and his baseball cap was worn on Wei's head, then her cosmetics and clothes were placed. The bag was discarded in the trash can in the Kansai service area before departing for Tainan.

The next day, relatives and friends saw the news and cared, and Liang’s wife knew that her husband had committed a murder case. Because Liang Wen was a recidivist from a young age, Liang’s wife received a phone call from her relatives and friends, and only said faintly: Oh! I won't take care of him outside.""
At that time, Liang Wenju, 64, had four children with his wife. However, Liang had an affair, and his wife’s mood changed from anger to indifference. For her husband's affair, Liang Qi had wanted to find the theory of Xiaosan, but for the sake of the child, she decided to swallow this grievance; the eldest son also wanted to rape, and finally failed to end. After discussion between Liang and his children, he decided to ignore Liang Nan. I did not expect to have a life case.

Until the police took Liang Wenyu away the next day, Liang wife received a phone call from relatives and friends, only to know that her husband killed Xiaosan, and four children heard the news and rushed home to comfort the mother, but Liang wife said: ""I have long been It’s a bearish, there’s no hate in my heart, how can I worry?”

Family persuasion, phone threatening
As for the deceased, Wei Minhua has been divorced and lived with a pair of children. Two years before the incident, she met Liang Wenji at a massage shop and two people became friends and men. Liang Yi began to express his living expenses for Wei. Wei also resigned from the massage shop and went to work at the betel nut booth.
Wei’s family told the police that Liang Wenji’s possessiveness was very strong. After one year of contact, Wei’s family learned that Liang was married and advised her not to interact with Liang. Liang also called to threaten Wei’s family several times. Wei also wants to sever the relationship with his family, and will also check Wei's communication content, so that Wei and his family are alienated.

Wei’s aunt said that during the period of Liang Wenju’s dealings with Wei, he promised to pay for living expenses every month. He also said that he would buy a car and a house for her, and even help to pay the debts. But in addition to the initial cost of living, all other jump tickets are basically Love liar. Later, Wei Yin’s father was seriously ill and returned home to live with his father and take care of her. When she left home, her father had to open the knife. After the operation, she also called and cared for it. I did not expect it to be the last phone call.
In response to this murder case, the court finally sentenced Liang Wenyue to 17 years in prison for killing and abandoning the body. In addition, he must pay 7 million yuan to the father and children of Wei. A dying love at dusk, taking away a human life, the murderer in his 60s can only spend his old age in prison.
