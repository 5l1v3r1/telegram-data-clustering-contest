Blame for the murder of a boy aged five lies partly with the Government for its failed attempt to privatise probation services, an official report has warned.
Alex Malcolm was beaten to death by his mother’s boyfriend Marvyn Iheanacho, 41, who had been released on licence from prison six months before for assaulting five exes.
An inquest jury last month found a series of errors due to disastrous probation privatisation “contributed to the death”.
Coroner Andrew Harris yesterday said increased workloads and understaffing, plus shortages of approved hostel places for ex-cons, were factors.

He demanded the Government make changes to probation services within 56 days, warning: “There is still a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.”
Alex died when Iheanacho attacked him after he lost a trainer in a park in Catford, South East London, in 2016. The murderer got at least 21 years.
Calling for action, Dr Harris, coroner in Southwark, South London, told the Government: “Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action.”
Alex’s mum Liliya Breha, 32, of Bromley, Kent, said: “The government should definitely take responsibility.”

Privatisation reforms under Chris Grayling cost almost £500million, yet killings by ex-inmates on parole increased 63%. All probation work is now being renationalised.
Harry Fletcher, of the Victims’ Rights Campaign, said: “The government’s own assessment in 2013 warned the probation changes would be very high risk – but they went ahead anyway.”
A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: “The National Probation Service in London has undertaken a huge programme of work to improve standards and better protect the public.”
