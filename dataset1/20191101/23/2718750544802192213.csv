Cuba Gooding Jr. Charged With Third Groping Accusation
01 Nov 2019, 23:57 by Charu Sinha
Cuba Gooding Jr. was accused of groping a third person in his ongoing sexual-misconduct trial on Thursday. An unnamed individual claims that Gooding touched “intimate parts” at a Manhattan nightclub last year. This follows two other accusations of groping against the actor for which he was charged: “grabbing a woman’s breast” at a bar in Times Square and “pinching the buttocks” of a woman at a nightclub, this past June and October of last year, respectively. Gooding was also accused of sexual misconduct by a dozen other women, but he has not been charged for these accusations. It is unclear if Gooding will be charged for these dozen complaints, or if the witnesses will be called to trial. Gooding pleaded not guilty to the third charge of groping. The official charges for the incident are the same as the previous two incidents, forcible touching and third-degree sexual abuse. The maximum penalty for forcible touching is a year in prison. Additional information about the third charge, including the exact time, place, and nature of the incident, has not been released.
