01 Nov 2019, 23:30 by Team XDA
The Honor 9X launched in China earlier this year with impressive specs at an affordable price. Last week, the Honor 9X launched in Russia and will soon be coming to the Netherlands. There’s a lot to still like about this phone now that it’s available in more markets. Joshua Vergara from Pocketnow recently went over 5 of them.



Joshua talks about how there are some things that you can get on the Honor 9X that some more expensive phones still don’t have. First, the cool pattern on the back is a small thing, but it sets the phone apart. Speaking of the back, the Honor 9X still has a fingerprint scanner on the rear, which is faster and more reliable than some of the newer options on the market right now.

Moving around the front, the Honor 9X has a stunning fullscreen display with no notches or hole-punches getting in the way. We’re still seeing a lot of flagship phones launch with those screen obstructions. The Honor 9X has a pop-up camera and the 48MP camera on the back is great, especially if you drop down to 12MP with pixel binning. Lastly, GPU Turbo is a great tool for kicking gaming performance up a notch.
