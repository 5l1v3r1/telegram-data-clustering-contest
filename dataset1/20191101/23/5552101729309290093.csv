【全文】3千名酒駕運將趴趴走　計程車禁業修法爆漏洞
01 Nov 2019, 23:58 by 黃驛淵, 王均峰, 林俊耀, 董孟航, 林煒凱
朝野烏龍修法，計程車禁業條款新制爆大漏洞！立法院今年3月三讀通過《道路交通管理處罰條例》部分條文修正案，新增「禁業條款」限制，6月起，必須12年內未因酒駕犯下公共危險罪或故意重傷前科，才可登記執業。本刊調查，禁業期限該不該溯及既往、從何時起算？已領證的要不要撤銷？條文卻未明定，讓有這2項前科的3,000名駕駛仍在路上趴趴走，爆發乘客安全疑慮，但若撤銷執業登記，卻也剝奪駕駛工作權，法令不明已讓執法出現空窗期。





行政院長蘇貞昌在立院備詢一再重申「酒駕零容忍」，計程車禁業條款修法漏洞如何善後，考驗他的政治智慧。

「我對酒駕的態度是零容忍！」正值立法院開議期，行政院長蘇貞昌15日在立法院答詢時明確宣示反酒駕立場，並表示出任院長後已送出「從嚴法案」、經立院通過。
蘇貞昌口中的從嚴法案，其中一項就是今年3月26日通過的酒駕新制；當時立法院三讀《道路交通管理處罰條例》部分條文修正案，除加重一般駕駛人的酒駕罰則，另針對計程車駕駛，也把酒駕觸犯公共危險罪及故意重傷前科，納入第37條的禁業條款之中，只要12年內曾犯這2項前科，都不得申請執業開計程車。然而朝野無異議通過的計程車禁業條款新制，卻被第一線執法人員發現有大漏洞。
本刊調查，計程車禁業條款新制實施前，計程車駕駛若酒駕犯下公共危險罪（即《刑法》第185條之3）或有故意重傷前科，原可合法申請執業登記，但6月1日新制實施後，因條文未明定「12年內前科」的限制從何時起算，導致第一線的執法人員對有這2項前科的運將到底該不該撤證，出現無所適從的情況，修法至今逾7個月，主管機關仍未給出具體解套方案，更使保護人民安全的新法令出現空窗期。


計程車禁業條款新制經立院三讀、總統頒布，因修法漏洞，政府如今陷入保障乘客安全與運將工作權的拔河。（翻攝畫面）

　
若溯及既往　剝奪工作權
本刊取得警政署內部統計資料，在計程車禁業條款新制實施前，有故意重傷前科或因酒駕犯下公共危險罪、卻已取得執業登記證的有2,570人；而新制施行前，有這2項前科卻完成執業登記報考程序的有542人、另有已完成執業登記測驗及講習共33人。換言之，因修法漏洞可能被撤證、禁考證的達3,145人。
這些可能被撤證、禁考證的司機仍在路上開車載客，無疑增加乘客安全風險。另一方面，若政府認定新制「溯及既往」，那原已合法營業的運將，即便在10年前有酒駕前科，都可能被撤證、面臨失業，工作權遭剝奪。


新制一旦溯及既往，全台超過3,000名原本合法營業的運將，可能面臨撤證的失業危機。

這項修法漏洞衍生2大問題，首先是已取得執業登記證的駕駛，過去犯有酒駕公共危險罪及故意重傷前科高達2,500多人，若是在12年內被判刑確定，不論1年、5年或12年內所犯，該不該撤銷他們的執業登記證？即便已領證的暫不撤，未來遇到補證、查驗、更換執業地點或更改執業登記事項時，要不要准許換證？
其次是「準運將」的考證資格。執法人員告訴本刊，以6月高屏區計程車駕駛人申請執業登記分區測驗為例，5月14日起就已受理報名，並在6月17日辦理測驗，但6月新制上路後，已完成報名程序的人，要不要允許他參加測驗、講習及請領執業登記證？


酒精濃度達每公升0.25毫克即觸犯公共危險罪，根據新規定，只要12年內有前科的人都禁開計程車載客。

「基於法律信賴保護原則，不該溯及既往！」台北市汽車駕駛員職業工會理事長鄭力嘉接受本刊採訪表示，修法前並未把酒駕納入禁業條款，如今卻要撤銷或不准報考、執業，對他們並不公平；旗下近2萬名運將的工會更已接到陳情，一名60歲運將去年酒駕被吊扣，但今年7月期滿想領回卻被交通警察大隊告知，要他等12年後再申請，「但過12年後都超過70歲了！」
　
條文有疑慮　暫允許領證
他表示，修法的過程中，行政、立法機關均未邀團體徵詢、討論，基於大法官釋憲保障計程車司機工作權的精神，不溯及既往才合情合理；而工會也會對內持續宣導「酒駕零容忍」。
「人生有幾個12年？」台灣酒駕防制社會關懷協會祕書長林美娜說，修法會把12年內不得酒駕納入禁業範圍，顯見酒駕已是非常嚴重的社會問題，但是否溯及既往應尊重法律專業，協會沒有特定立場。


官員說，當初修法會把酒駕及故意重傷前科納入禁業條款，正是認為對乘客人身安全有重大危害。

漏洞如何補破網？牽涉部門包括交通部及警政署。本刊掌握，警政署6月及8月2度去函交通部表示遇到問題，並詢問如何處理；在交通部尚未答覆前，警政署現階段不敢執法，已「暫時准許」12年內犯有酒駕公共危險罪及故意重傷前科的司機繼續開計程車或換證，已報考的也暫准參加測驗、領證。
警政署並公文建議，若修法意旨要涵蓋這2罪，交通部必須明確函釋；若本意並不溯及既往，則應該再提修法，把12年禁業起算日期，明確增訂在法條中。

計程車運將禁業條款為何訂12年
交通部「計程車駕駛人執業登記資格限制研究計畫」曾研究蒐集2001與2002年間犯下禁業罪的計程車駕駛再犯率，受緩刑人至第12年再犯的僅1人（占所有緩刑人0.01％），出監人只3人（占出監人0.027％）；絕大多數在第11年後，再犯率均小於1％，少數公共危險第184條及恐嚇取財罪、兒少或性侵、殺人及恐嚇取財罪第11年以後再犯率則為1.0至2.1％不等。其中毒品犯再犯率最高，其次是強盜、搶奪及恐嚇取財等財產暴力犯罪，最低則是懲治走私條例前科者。

　
修法補漏洞　二派互拔河

儘管行政部門尚未拍板後續作法，但本刊掌握，對修法漏洞該如何處理，二派仍在拔河。一派主張應溯及既往、廢止執業登記並認為修法沒問題。
知情官員說，當初修法就是認為這2項前科都對乘客安全有重大危害，且未訂12年條款的起算日，也可解釋成要溯及既往，並可依《行政程序法》「對公益有危害」為由立即廢止執業登記，但警政單位卻不敢執法。不過一旦廢止，運將也可依法主張適當補償。
另一派則認為不該溯及既往；此派主張，新制規定「不得辦理計程車駕駛人執業登記」，依文義解釋，在新法施行前就已取得執業登記證的司機，只要證件還在效期內，就不須再申請，因此當然不必撤證；但因《計程車駕駛人執業登記管理辦法》第14條規定，執業登記證每滿3年換發一次，未來換證時，仍須檢視前科紀錄，一旦12年內曾犯下這2罪，就不得再換證、執業。


計程車禁業新制「12年前科」條款要不要溯及既往，相關部門有二派意見，讓第一線執法人員無所適從。

立意良善的修法，反而讓3,000名酒駕、重傷犯運將「暫時」可執業，相關單位應儘速妥適處理，避免悲劇發生。

交通部回應：正徵詢法制及實務意見
交通部接受本刊採訪回應，當初修法是考量這2項犯行影響計程車乘客人身安全；另依司法院大法官會議第584、749號解釋意旨，並參考交通部委託辦理的計程車駕駛人執業登記資格限制研究計畫結論，除犯妨害性自主與兒童及少年性剝削防制條例等罪維持終身禁業外，其餘各罪的禁業期間都定為12年，以保障乘客人身安全，並適度兼顧計程車駕駛人工作權。
交通部並坦言，立法院修法期間，並未針對新法上路前已取得執業登記、曾犯相關罪刑確定者是否應予以廢止等課題討論、並確認立法意旨；對此，交通部正徵詢相關單位法制及實務意見中。

[Full Text] 3,000 wines will be driven away by taxis
01 Nov 2019, 23:58 by Huang Yiyuan, Wang Junfeng, Lin Junyao, Dong Menghang, Lin Yikai
The ruling of the ruling oxen, the taxi system banned new terms and explosions! The Legislative Yuan passed the amendments to some provisions of the Road Traffic Management and Punishment Ordinance in March this year. It has added a new ""prohibition clause"". From June onwards, it is necessary to sue public drink crimes or intentionally seriously injure the predecessors for 12 years. Can be registered for practice. According to our survey, should the period of prohibition of the industry be retroactive and from when? Have you ever revoked the certificate? The provision has not been clarified, so that 3,000 drivers with these two previous subjects are still on the road, causing passenger safety concerns. However, if the practice registration is revoked, the right to drive is also deprived. The law has caused the law enforcement to have an empty window.





The Chief Executive of the Executive, Su Shichang, repeatedly asked the Liyuan to repeat the ""zero tolerance of drunk driving"". How to repair the loopholes in the taxi ban is a test of his political wisdom.

""My attitude towards drunk driving is zero tolerance!"" During the opening of the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Director Su Shichang clearly declared his anti-drunk driving stance on the 15th in the Legislative Yuan's inquiry. He also said that he had sent the ""Strict Act"" after the appointment of the Dean. The hospital passed.
One of the stricter bills in Su Shichang’s mouth was the new drunk driving system passed on March 26 this year. At that time, the Legislative Yuan read the amendments to the provisions of the “Road Traffic Management Punishment Regulations” in addition to aggravating the driving rules of ordinary drivers and other taxis. Driving, also drunk driving public crimes and intentionally seriously injured the predecessor, included in the prohibition clause of Article 37, as long as they have committed these two previous subjects within 12 years, they are not allowed to apply for a taxi. However, the new system of taxi bans passed by the ruling and opposition parties was found to be flawed by first-line law enforcement officers.
According to the survey, before the new system of taxi operating bans is implemented, if the taxi driver commits a public hazard (ie, Article 185 of the Criminal Law) or has a deliberately serious injury, he may legally apply for practice registration, but June 1 After the implementation of the new system, since the provisions of the provisions of the ""12-year-old pre-existing"" restrictions have not been determined, the law enforcement officers on the first line should not withdraw the evidence for the operation of these two previous subjects, and there is no way to adapt. For more than seven months, the competent authorities have still not given a specific solution, and the new law that protects people's safety has an empty window.


The new system of taxis was banned by the Third Reading of the Legislative Yuan and the President promulgated. Due to loopholes in the law, the government is now in a tug-of-war to protect passenger safety and the right to work. (Rewind screen)


If the past is deprived of the right to work
The journal obtained the internal statistics of the Police Department. Before the implementation of the new scheme for the prohibition of taxis, there were 2,570 persons who had intentionally seriously injured the criminal record or committed a public hazard because of drunk driving, but had obtained a practice registration certificate. Before the implementation of the new system, there was this. There were 542 people who completed the practice registration application procedures in the two previous subjects, and 33 others completed the practice registration test and the class. In other words, 3,145 people may be dismissed and banned due to loopholes in the law.
These drivers who may be dismissed and banned are still driving passengers on the road, which will undoubtedly increase passenger safety risks. On the other hand, if the government determines that the new system is ""backtracking"", then the transport operators who have been legally operating, even if they have drunk driving 10 years ago, may be disqualified, face unemployment, and deprived of their right to work.


Once the new system is retroactive, more than 3,000 operators who are legally operating in Taiwan may face an unemployment crisis.

This practice loophole derives two major problems. The first is the driving that has obtained the practice registration certificate. In the past, there were more than 2,500 people who had committed public drink crimes and deliberately seriously injured. If they were sentenced within 12 years, they were sentenced to 1 or 5 years. Or committed within 12 years, should not revoke their practice registration certificate? Even if the certificate has not been withdrawn, will it be necessary to renew the license in the future when it encounters the re-certification, inspection, replacement of the practice location or change of the practice registration?
The second is the qualification of the ""Quasi-Operation"". Law enforcement officials told this magazine that in June, Gao Ping District taxi drivers applied for the practice registration zone test as an example. Since May 14th, they have accepted the application and conducted the test on June 17, but after the new system was launched in June, Do the people who complete the registration process allow him to take the test, the class, and ask for a practice registration certificate?


The alcohol concentration of 0.25 milligrams per liter is a crime against public danger. According to the new regulations, as long as there are people with a previous record within 12 years, taxi drivers are forbidden.

""Based on the principle of legal trust protection, it should not be retroactive!"" Zheng Lijia, chairman of the Taipei Automobile Drivers Professional Trade Union, said in an interview with the magazine that the drunk driving was not included in the prohibition clause before the amendment, but now it is necessary to cancel or not apply, Practicing, it is unfair to them; the nearly 20,000 trade unions of the company have received Chen Qing, a 60-year-old transporter was drunk in drunk driving last year, but in July this year, he wanted to get back but was informed by the traffic police brigade. I want him to wait 12 years and apply again. ""But after 12 years, they are over 70 years old!""

Provisions have doubts
He said that during the process of practicing the law, the administrative and legislative organs did not invite groups to consult and discuss. Based on the spirit of the judge's interpretation of the constitution to protect the working rights of taxi drivers, it is not reasonable to go back and forth; and the trade unions will continue to publicize the inside. Zero tolerance for drunk driving.""
""Is there a few 12 years in life?"" Lin Meina, secretary-general of the Taiwan Association of Drinking and Driving Social Care, said that the law enforcement will not allow drunk driving to be included in the ban on business for 12 years. It is obvious that drunk driving is a very serious social problem, but it should be retroactive. Respect for the legal profession, the association has no specific position.


Officials said that the original law will include drunk driving and intentional serious injury in the forbidden clause, which is considered to be a major hazard to passengers' personal safety.

How does the vulnerability fill the network? The departments involved include the Ministry of Communications and the Police Department. The Journal is in charge of the Police Department's letter to the Ministry of Communications in June and August 2 that they have encountered problems and asked how to deal with them. Before the Ministry of Communications has yet to reply, the Police Department has not dared to enforce the law at this stage and has been ""temporarily permitted"". During the year, drivers who were guilty of drunk driving public hazards and deliberately seriously injured the previous section continued to drive taxis or renew their licenses. Those who have already applied for the examinations are also temporarily allowed to participate in the test and the certificate.
The Police Department also proposed in the official document that if the purpose of the law is to cover these two crimes, the Ministry of Communications must clearly explain the letter; if the intention is not retroactive, then the law should be amended to set the date for the 12-year ban and clearly added to the law. in.

Taxi transport will be forbidden for 12 years
The Ministry of Communications' ""Study on the Qualifications for the Registration of Taxi Drivers"" has studied the collection of recidivism rates for taxis that committed the crime of imprisonment between 2001 and 2002. Only one person who was reinstated by the probationer in the 12th year (accounting for all probationers) %), only 3 persons were issued (accounting for 0.027% of the supervisor); the vast majority of the recidivism rate was less than 1% after the 11th year, a few public dangers 184 and threats of financial misappropriation, childishness or sex The rate of recidivism after the 11th year of the crime of invading, killing and intimidating fortune is between 1.0 and 2.1%. Among them, drug offenders have the highest rate of recidivism, followed by property violent crimes such as robbers, looting and intimidation of wealth, and the lowest is the punishment of former smuggling regulations.


Repairing the law to fill the loophole


It is not uncommon for drunk driving to cause disasters, so that the society has a high degree of consensus on heavy drunk driving. In recent years, the government has become more and more strict with the penalties and regulations of taxi drivers. (Oriental IC)

Although the administrative department has not yet made a follow-up practice, the journal has mastered how to deal with the loopholes in the revision of the law. The two factions are still tug-of-war. One group advocates that it should go back to the past, abolish the practice registration and think that there is no problem in the revision of the law.
The informed official said that the original practice was that the two pre-existing subjects were seriously harmful to passenger safety, and that the starting date of the 12-year clause could not be interpreted as retroactive and could be based on the Administrative Procedure Act. If there is a hazard, the practice registration will be abolished immediately, but the police unit will not dare to enforce the law. However, once abolished, the operator can also claim appropriate compensation according to law.
The other party thinks that it should not be retroactive; this group advocates that the new system stipulates that ""the registration of taxi drivers must not be registered"", according to Wen Yiyi, the driver who has obtained the practice registration certificate before the implementation of the new law, as long as the documents are still in effect There is no need to apply again, so of course it is not necessary to withdraw the certificate; however, due to the provisions of Article 14 of the “Regulations for the Administration of Taxi Drivers Registration”, the practice registration certificate will be renewed every three years, and the record of the previous record will still be required for future renewal. Once these two crimes have been committed within 12 years, they will not be allowed to change their licenses or practice.


The new ""12 years ago"" clause of the taxi ban should be retroactive, and the relevant departments have two opinions, so that the frontline law enforcement officers are at a loss.

Instead of practicing good law, 3,000 drunk drivers and seriously injured people will be ""temporarily"" practicable, and relevant units should handle them as soon as possible to avoid tragedies.

Ministry of Communications responds: seeking legal and practical advice
The Ministry of Communications accepted the interview and responded to this journal. The original method was to consider the impact of these two crimes on the personal safety of taxi passengers. In addition, the interpretation of the stipulations of the Chief Justices Meeting No. 584 and No. 749, and the qualification of the taxi driver's practice registration entrusted by the Ministry of Communications Limiting the conclusions of the research plan, in addition to the nuisance autonomy and the child and juvenile sexual exploitation prevention regulations and other crimes to maintain a life-long ban, the rest of the crimes are scheduled for 12 years to protect the personal safety of passengers, and moderately Taxi driver's right to work.
The Ministry of Communications also admitted that during the trial of the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Communications was consulting the relevant authorities for the purpose of discussing and confirming the legislative intent of the establishment of the practice registration before the new law, whether the person who has committed the relevant crimes should be abolished, etc. In the practical opinion.
