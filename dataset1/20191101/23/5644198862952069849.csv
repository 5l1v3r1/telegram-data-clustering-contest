""The human, like everyone, feels. Xhaka's issues last week is one issue that needs time. He needs time to recover the normality in him,"" Emery told a news conference on Friday.
""He said sorry, he gave the apology to the supporters and to everybody. Now is the focus on the match.
""We were waiting on Monday and Tuesday (to sort out the captaincy). It is not in my mind that he will play tomorrow.""
