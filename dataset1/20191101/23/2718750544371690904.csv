The Rock To Become a Dramatic Leading Man In Biopic About MMA Fighter Mark Kerr
01 Nov 2019, 23:27 by Jordan Crucchiola
The Rock is diversifying his huge portfolio. Variety reported today that the former professional wrestler will play MMA fighter and UFC champion Mark Kerr. While the biopic will involve work like fighting in arenas for paying audiences, it will also dig into Kerr’s painkiller addiction, his friendships, and his romantic relationships, which the Rock does not have very often across his many, many movies. Pathos! Kerr was also known as The Smashing Machine, which was also the title of a documentary about him from 2002. In addition to starring, The Rock will also executive produce through his Seven Bucks banner, and we’re pretty sure he won’t have any issues getting into MMA fighting shape for the role. That part of the character prep should be totally fine.
