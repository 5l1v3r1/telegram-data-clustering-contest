A massive car collection went up for auction in the U.K. on Saturday, Nov. 2. The collection had been stored on a property that was sold for redevelopment

The auctioneer says the 135 cars were kept in a series of barns across the plot but didn’t provide details about how they came together. They are being sold as-is without documentation or warranty.

The Hustler was designed by Aston Martin designer William Towns. Approximately 500 were sold in various configurations. (NCM Auctioneers)
