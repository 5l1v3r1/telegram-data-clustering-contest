溫斯頓、閃光及其他《鬥陣特攻》的角色將與新世代的英雄齊心協力，在緊張刺激的合作故事任務中一同奮戰。新的全球危機隨著四人任務展開，玩家將親身體驗《鬥陣特攻》故事劇情的下一篇章，扮演不同類型的英雄，保護世界不受零度象限荼毒，並揭開智械之發動攻擊的幕後原因，挺身對抗全球各地新崛起的威脅。



戰鬥將在英雄任務中繼續，被召集的英雄需要突破自身極限，前往世界各地防守遭到機器人侵略的城市，並與精英級的利爪組織特工決一死戰，更要對抗環伺各國的邪惡勢力。在這個百玩不厭的遊戲模式中，玩家可以升級英雄並取得強大的自訂物品，這些物品可以增強英雄技能，讓你更有優勢攻克難關。你可以選擇用萊因哈特的烈焰擊點燃附近的敵人，或是讓火箭鎚揮舞的速度變得奇快無比；你也可以修改小美的冷凍槍，讓被冰凍的敵人承受更多傷害，死亡後還會產生致命的冰塊碎片。
