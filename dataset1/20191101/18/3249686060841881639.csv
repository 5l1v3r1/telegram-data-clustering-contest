01 Nov 2019, 18:23 by newsforkpop



The ubiquitous K-pop band BTS recently concluded their last tour for their Speak Yourself tour in Seoul. It was a phenomenal successas usual, and all the performances were very much appreciated.
One of the solo performances, though, stole the entire show.
""Singularity"" performed by Kim Taehyung aka BTS V was even more dazzling than usual. BTS V's outfit of black feathers coupled with his gorgeous visuals was so ethereal that k-netz gave him the nickname of ""Black Swan"". 
His performance was so eye-catching that KBS new channel said that it was the highlight of Seoul concert.



The entertainment channel said that : ""One of the best performances of the day was a solo performance by a member V. Unlike the previous stages,V wore a costume that reminded us of Black Swan and showed an alluring and seductive sophisticated dance, drawing attention from fans all over the world. When the stage was over, it caused an explosive reaction, ranking 9th in the real-time the U.S social networking services.""Korean portals TheQoo and instiz could not stop talking about his out-of-this world portrayal.

He also gained the nicknames ""Hades"" (of Greek mythology) and ""Howl"" (from Howl's moving Castle)!

With just one performance, BTS V captivated the hearts of millions. His charisma on stage is truly incomparable and his performance in these final stages were filled with not only his usual excellent dancing, but the way he actually infused his dance with his emotions and could bring out the pain that is there in the lyrics and could express that is remarkably astounding.



Kim Taehyung is genuinely one of a kind - he is the whole package a performer should be. We look forward with bated breath to see what new stage he will reveal in the future.
