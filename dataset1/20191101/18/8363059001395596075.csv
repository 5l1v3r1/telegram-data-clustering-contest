Can A Battery Made From 1000 Lemons Start A Car?
01 Nov 2019, 18:30 by Tegan Jones
It's the question that nobody ever asked, and yet it has now been answered.
While lemons (and potatoes) are often turned into mini batteries for school project, we've never heard of anyone combining the power of a thousand to power a car.
Until now.
Garage 54, a YouTube account known for its outlandish motoring experiments, made the attempt in one of its recent videos.
Yes, they really took the time to cut up and hook up that many lemons for this experiment. Respect.
We won't spoil the outcome, but hope you enjoy the ride and ""juice"" jokes.







Gizmodo Australia is gobbling up the news in a different timezone, so check them out if you need another Giz fix.
