Super Rare Games has today revealed that it has partnered up with Image & Form and Thunderful to release a physical edition of SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech on Nintendo Switch.
A physical release has been on the cards since before the game even released, but it's nice to see that the day has finally arrived. Pre-orders for the physical edition will be going live exclusively on Super Rare Games on 7th November.
Strangely enough, the deal with Super Rare took place over a game of chess between company founder George Perkins and CEO of Image & Form, Brjann Sigurgeirsson. In a press release covering the announcement, Perkins says, ""I jokingly mentioned that if I beat him he would have to sign with us to release SteamWorld Quest physically! I got beat very, very badly but luckily we still managed to sign the deal"".
Excitingly, he goes on to say, ""I hope we can bring the rest of the amazing SteamWorld series as a physical release in the near future"". Yes please.



If you need a catch up on what SteamWorld Quest is all about, make sure to check out our full review. We'll leave just a snippet below:
""Remarkably solid and satisfying, SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech is a card battler with an abundance of charm in its art, mechanics and writing. The presentation is slick, the dialogue’s witty and the gameplay’s addictive, although nothing about it feels particularly special – not in the way SteamWorld Dig 2 felt special. It does what it does well, though, and it’s still a thoroughly enjoyable time in that universe.""
