Enter now to win an extremely limited edition Terminator: Dark Fate Xbox One X!
01 Nov 2019, 18:16 by Ash

In celebration of Terminator: Dark Fate, Xbox is giving you the chance to win a one-of-a-kind custom Xbox One X console that’s inspired by the sleek design of the Rev-9 Terminator.

This console is the only one of its kind in the entire world! It features the Rev-9’s black skull emerging from the console with a matching metallic controller.
To make things even cooler, the Rev-9’s eye lights up with an ominous red glow when connected to power.



Along with the Terminator: Dark Fate console, the one lucky winner will also receive the following:

Matching controller
Gears 5 Ultimate Edition
Gears 5 Terminator: Dark Fate Character Pack, featuring Grace and the Rev-9
Gears 5 Terminator: Dark Fate Character Pack, featuring Sarah Connor and the T-800
A second, normal-edition Xbox One X

It should be noted that the Terminator: Dark Fate console is, sadly, a display-only console, which is why the winner also gets a normal Xbox One X console alongside it.
