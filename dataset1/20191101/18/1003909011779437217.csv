'It's either that or you die': Desperate billboard campaign leads to donated kidney — and friend for life
01 Nov 2019, 18:32 by Shawn Logan



When 38 airplanes were diverted to Newfoundland in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks, Tony Timmons’ parents didn’t hesitate in opening their door to strangers in need.
So when the 48-year-old FedEx driver first saw a billboard last year pleading for a live kidney donor to help Calgary teacher Ryan McLennan, the decision to try and assist a perfect stranger came as naturally for him as it did for his parents and the 12,000 or so other residents of Gander, whose warm generosity was made famous in the Tony Award-winning musical Come From Away.
“I was just on the way to work and I see this billboard,” said Timmons, of Airdrie, who on Nov. 28 will mark the one-year anniversary of a successful transplant surgery that gave McLennan a new lease on life.
After seeing the billboard, it prompted Timmons to do some research and soul-searching.
“I just did some Google searching on all the stuff and what it’s all about, and I prayed about it and I said, ‘We’ll see what happens,’” recalled Timmons. “If it were me, what would you do?”
McLennan’s dire plight received significant media attention in February of 2018 when family and friends erected 27 billboards province-wide, along with creating bumper stickers and a social media campaign aimed at unearthing a living donor willing to part with a kidney to give the 44-year-old shop teacher at Father Lacombe high school a shot at returning to a normal life.
He’d already had one of his mother’s kidneys successfully transplanted in 2002, but by the end of 2015 McLennan began experiencing health problems and knew that he would probably need a second kidney to survive.
“In 2018, just a month after I was married, I went on emergency dialysis and that’s when we started this whole journey to try to find someone that could help me,” McLennan said.
“You really pray for a miracle. You keeping thinking, ‘OK something’s going to come up, someone’s going to come forward, like a family member.’ And then when that doesn’t happen, you just keep hoping. And that’s the problem — you’ve got to do more.”

For many people, asking for help can be difficult. But the thought of asking someone to have an organ removed from his or her body can be nearly paralyzing.
“I don’t even know how to describe it,” McLennan said. “It took me eight months to ask my brother. It’s almost easier to get someone else to ask, even though it’s your own life, and you’re like you need to take this action.
“There’s this whole portion that’s constantly going over in your head that something could happen to this person and that’s one of the hardest things,” he said.
Fortunately for McLennan, his wife Shakina wasn’t willing to quietly wait on the sidelines for a functioning kidney to materialize.
Getting inspiration from another billboard campaign she’d seen while travelling to her homeland of Vietnam, Shakina enlisted family and friends to ramp up a public campaign to secure a life-saving kidney transplant for her husband.
“It’s either that, or you die. It’s as simple as that, right?” she said.
“And that’s what I told him. It’s your life, you have to fight for it. To me, it’s more like I would do whatever it takes to get you a kidney.”

And so up went the bright yellow billboards, showing McLennan and his wife along with their beloved Doberman pinscher Athena. “Ryan McLennan needs a living kidney donor. Blood type O,” was all the message read, along with a phone number and name of the campaign’s Facebook page.
Beyond any of their wildest hopes, the message resonated.
According to the McLennans, the campaign generated more than 150 inquiries resulting in about 30 potential donors put on a list for a battery of testing, including medical, surgical and psychological assessments for those willing to spare a kidney.
Patients requiring kidney transplants historically account for nearly eight in 10 people on national organ wait lists, despite the fact the vast majority of humans can live a normal life with just one functioning kidney. The organ serves a critical function in helping filter blood and removing waste materials and extra fluid from the body.
As of 2018, one in 10 Canadians was suffering from kidney disease with millions more at risk. Some 48,000 were suffering from kidney failure, with about 3,500 on the organ transplant list. More than 1,600 kidney transplants were performed last year, though another 350 people died or withdrew from the wait list, primarily because they were no longer healthy enough to be a viable candidate for surgery.
Knowing he was on that knife’s edge compelled McLennan to act, with a healthy push from Shakina, despite his own doubts that someone who didn’t even know him would make that kind of sacrifice.
“I had a couple of really close friends and really close relatives and I kept thinking in my mind that if they are not going to test for me, then why would a stranger?” he recalled. “I thought it was the silliest idea in the world. Because, I’m like, I can’t even convince this friend of 25 years to go for a blood test; why would someone do that for me?”



But as the phone calls began coming in, hope began to grow, and he soon found out through a mutual acquaintance that Timmons was undergoing testing to see if he was a match for McLennan.
Then came the day when he learned Timmons was indeed a match.
“I couldn’t believe it. I just sat down in a chair, my class had started, and I just was in awe,” he said.
A few months later, the two men were lying in separate rooms at Calgary’s Foothills hospital, and the life-saving organ was shuttled from Timmons to McLennan.
When the last surgery staple was administered, McLennan’s world changed almost instantly.
“I actually didn’t go to sleep for two days — I just kept walking. I was just on top of the world,” he said. “I was just up and just felt incredible and the nurses . . . couldn’t believe it. Everyone was kind of in shock I was doing so well.”
A year later, McLennan is a new man. No longer needing dialysis to clean his blood every other day, he’s returned to teaching and is looking forward to enjoying life to its fullest.
And he now has a new best friend to share that with.
“We see each other two or three times a week. I’m beating him at pickle ball,” said Timmons with a wry smile, when asked about their relationship.
For McLennan, that this lifelong connection grew out of a desperate campaign to save his life continues to leave him awestruck.
“It just blows me away to this day,” he said. “The support that I’ve gotten from Tony and Lisa (Timmons’ wife) is a miracle; it’s really a miracle.”
