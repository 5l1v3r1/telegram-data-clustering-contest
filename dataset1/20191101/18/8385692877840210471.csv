This A/V receiver is going to be great for those that are building a pretty large entertainment center. As you can connect everything into this receiver and have it all controlled with a single remote.
The Onkyo TX-RZ630 A/V Receiver has support for Dolby Atmos and DTS:x so you're going to get some really good sound out of this receiver. Especially if your TV and sound bar also support it.

There's a whopping seven HDMI ports on the backside, for connecting everything. There are two that support 4K/60Hz. All of these support HDR10, HLG, Dolby Vision, and HDCP 2.2 pass-through. Onkyo has also included a front-facing HDMI port for convenience.
Those that might have a TV, surround sound system, a few gaming consoles and a cable box, this Onkyo TX-RZ630 A/V Receiver is going to definitely be worth picking up. And according to the Black Friday ad-scans that we have already seen, this isn't going to get any cheaper when Black Friday rolls around in a few weeks. So now is the time to pick one up. A/V equipment and TVs are generally on sale cheaper before Black Friday than on Black Friday itself. So you'll want to get this one today, before it goes back up.
