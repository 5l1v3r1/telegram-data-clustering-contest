Diablo IV officially announced
01 Nov 2019, 18:22 by Ash

Diablo IV was officially announced today, Friday the 1st of November, during BlizzCon 2019.

You can watch the announcement cinematic for the game below. Just be aware that it’s considerably gory.



The cinematic shows several adventurers entering a temple with their sights set on treasure. Instead of treasure, they each come across their various untimely ends – save for one, who it turns out was actually the mastermind behind the whole bloody scheme.
The last adventurer then proceeds to summon the demon known as the ‘Blessed Mother’ or Lilith, who appears to be a female Diablo. Then the adventurer pops his clogs. Success!



You can check out the first official gameplay trailer for Diablo IV below. It shows off three of the game’s character classes: Druid, Sorceress, and Barbarian.



The news isn’t exactly a surprise, especially after Diablo IV was accidentally leaked ahead of BlizzCon 2019, but will be welcome news nonetheless for any Diablo fan.
The game is the latest instalment in the action RPG hack-and-slash dungeon crawler series from Blizzard Entertainment. The Diablo games take place in a fictional world known as Sanctuary, a realm where humans must battle against demons known as the Prime Evils.
Diablo IV will technically be the fifth instalment in the Diablo franchise after the announcement of Diablo Immortal last year. Diablo Immortal is an MMORPG for iOS and Android devices that was met with intense backlash from fans when it was announced at BlizzCon 2018.
Diablo IV will release on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. There’s no current set date, but don’t expect to see it before the end of 2019 – it’ll most likely come out in 2020.
