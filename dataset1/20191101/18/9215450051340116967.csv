【阿里巴巴上市】傳11月上市！抽新股2招必勝法 4點分辨新股質素
01 Nov 2019, 18:21 by 投資
【阿里巴巴上市】最近香港新股市場又熱鬧起來，市傳科網巨擘阿里巴巴集團（美股編號：BABA）最快於11月登陸香港。由阿里巴巴大名鼎鼎，勢可延續抽股熱。投資者如要透過抽新股賺錢，除祈求幸運之神眷顧外，其實亦可花點力氣增加中籤率。是次邀得信誠證券聯席董事張智威教路，傳授買賣新股及半新股必勝法。

2招增加抽新股勝算
顧名思義，抽新股能否中籤與否涉及彩數。撇除運氣這個因素，投資者亦可運用一些小技巧增加中籤率，從而「分到多啲貨」，張智威就分享了兩招常用技巧。第一招是「全家總動員」，靠的是人海戰術，適合只想小試牛刀及不想借孖展的投資者。張智威稱，投資者要動用所有可以用的戶口，以一人一手的人頭政策出擊。
第二招則利用公開發售部分內，A組及B組認購不足額部分回撥機制，以增加分貨數目。這招較適合有一定財力人士，但資金少的投資者亦可透過孖展做得到。張智威解釋，香港公開發售可供認購的發售股份總數基本上分為A組及B組，以500萬元認購金額作為兩組的分界線，500萬元以上的為B組；以下則為A組。
新股於招股書會列明分貨機制（A、B組各佔的分配比例），一般是對開，當B組的認購申請較少，A組較多時，B組的可獲分配股份就會較多。張智威稱，通常人們抽新股都會貼近在A組尾或B組頭認購，希望在比率上博分到最多貨。
「有時A組尾或B組頭認購銀碼可能差唔多，400幾萬同500萬咁樣，但分出嚟嘅貨係可以差好遠嘅。」不過有時各組分貨情況又會倒轉，視乎各組認購數目。譬如近日上市的亞盛醫藥—B（06855），A組尾獲分股份較B組多。「咁就喺呢條線中間跳嚟跳去嘞。」

4點分辨新股質素
辛辛苦苦抽得新股，無非亦為賺錢，故亦要抽得其所，挑選質優靚股來抽才算得上抽得精明。今年「新股王」為傲迪瑪汽車（08418），累升612.5%，被譽為2019年「凍資王」的中手游（00302）開閘即遇滑鐵盧，暗盤價僅得低單位數升幅，借孖展抽的投資客更要蝕息，實令人大跌眼鏡。不過，掛牌翌日（11月1日）股價表現神勇，單日一度急升18.7%。
張智威表示，判別新股質素與上市公司基本相同：

該新股在同業間的市盈率不要太高，處於偏低水平的較理想。
了解新股的賺錢能力及集資目的。企業在過去幾年的盈利基礎如何？有沒有負面消息？要知道有的公司上市集資純為還債，又或是將錢全數用作派息派清光，遂要靠上市來集資。
公司利潤及前景明朗。一間有前景的企業是值得憧憬的，例如啤酒股百威亞太（01876）和體育用品股滔搏（06110），兩者分別具備內需概念，故兩者可獲看高一線。
新股的保薦人亦好重要，具有一定指標性。

小心投機味太濃的股份
保薦人保薦往績很值得參考。有些保薦人保薦的新股一般都有不錯升幅，故被譽為實力比較強的保薦人，自然比較有信心。相反一些保薦人保薦的新股以跌穿招股價收場的，就當然要小心了。成功抽得新股只是搵銀第一步，還要沽得及時有錢落袋才為之勝利。
張智威坦言，實際上並無最佳沽貨策略。所謂價格可升可跌，新股有機會像穿雲箭般直線上升，也可以在上市後股價直插無水花。譬如快餐帝國（01843）在上週三（23日）掛牌當日稍為炒高後就不斷向下跌；又如向中國際（01871）上週四（24日）甫上市即高見1.48元的歷史新高，但近日最低見0.58元。
張智威建議採取分段沽出，穩健地去贏得最佳回報，「新股股價每升些少就沽些少」。他表示，假設手持五或六手，股價每升10%至20%就酌量減持；又或是股價每次一回調，跌夠10%再減持。至於持貨少的散戶，張智威自己一般用股價升30%或50%作為沽貨分界線。他認為，新股市場的定價非亂定，若股份價格較定價升30%或50%，某程度上已屬過分熱炒。
當新股可以升至50%還繼續炒下去的話，其實已經出現「𤓓味」，不宜繼續持有。此亦不禁令人疑惑，難道上市公司的定價是亂定的嗎？這反映炒味太濃。「如果抽到八手至十手，留一至兩手嚟博到最後都可以。但係冇理由全部攞嚟咁博，風險太高，我就唔會選擇咁做啦。」
翻查最近半新股的走勢，較招股價升超過50%的不少，有的更高逾500%。張智威指升幅視乎個股不同，屬『斷隻秤』，而幅度可以好大好波動。而早前當炒的魯大師（03601），股價幾近翻一番。張智威認為涉及數個因素，包括貨乾、受惠母公司三六零（601360）高知名度。
他籲投資者小心，新股在短時間內累積如此大的升幅，故不能用任何基本分析去解構，已完全脫離基本面。在穩定市況中，炒高亞太可能仍不會出事，但若發生貿易戰「傾唔掂數」、恒生指數急回千點等負面因素，市況突然逆轉，這些被炒高的新股就會是首先被拋售的對象，投資者要有心理準備。
張智威寄語：「切忌貪勝不知輸，見好要收。」高位捨得放手，沽錯又有冇得救？想撈返轉頭，張智威稱百威亞太（01876）是值得考慮的好選擇。他分析，難得其股價現在回調至30元以下，而百威更是這麼多隻新股或半新股中，潛力最具憧憬的股份。
張智威續說，百威的市值高近4,000億元，與一眾藍籌股市值比併，百威為10大之內。他估計，百威將來好大機會晉身恒生指數。一旦成事，被動式基金如盈富基金（02800）要買入。除百威這隻重磅新貴，接下來又有一焦點新股攻港。
內地奶粉巨頭中國飛鶴（06186）於週三（30日）至下週二（11月5日）招股， 發行約8.9億股，欲集資最多近90億元。每股招股價介乎7.5元至10元；每手入場費約10,100元。集團管理層透露，是次集資將用於潛在併購、建設廠房、償還離岸債務。張智威稱，飛鶴屬百威後比較大的股份，相信會令市場留意。有意抽新股的你就要開始備戰了。

[Alibaba listed] spread in November! 2 new shares to win new shares, 4 points to distinguish the quality of new shares
01 Nov 2019, 18:21 by Investment
[Alibaba listed] Recently, Hong Kong's new stock market has become bustling. The Alibaba Group (BBA), the city's largest online company, landed in Hong Kong as early as November. Known by Alibaba, it is possible to continue to sell stocks. Investors who want to make money by drawing new shares, in addition to praying for the god of luck, can actually spend some effort to increase the winning rate. This time, Zhang Zhiwei, the co-director of Xincheng Securities, was invited to teach the road to teach the sale of new shares and semi-new shares.

2 strokes to increase the odds of winning new shares
As the name suggests, whether the new shares can be won or not involves the number of colors. In addition to the factor of luck, investors can also use some tips to increase the winning rate, thus ""dividing more goods"", Zhang Zhiwei shared two common techniques. The first move is ""the whole family mobilization"", relying on the human tactics, suitable for investors who only want to try their best and don't want to borrow. Zhang Zhiwei said that investors should use all available accounts and attack with one-person policy.
The second measure uses the partial callback mechanism for the under-subscription of Group A and Group B in the Open Offer to increase the number of shares. This is more suitable for people with certain financial resources, but investors with less capital can also do it through exhibitions. Zhang Zhiwei explained that the total number of Offer Shares available for subscription in the Hong Kong Public Offering is basically divided into Group A and Group B. The subscription amount of 5 million yuan is used as the boundary between the two groups. The group with more than 5 million yuan is Group B; the following is A. group.
The new shares will list the distribution mechanism (the proportion of each of the Group A and Group B) in the prospectus, which is generally open. When the Group B has fewer applications for subscription, when the Group A has more, the Group B will be allocated shares. More. Zhang Zhiwei said that people usually buy new stocks that will be close to the end of Group A or Group B, and hope to score the most in the ratio.
""Sometimes the end of Group A or Group B head subscription silver code may be much different, 400 million and 5 million, but the distribution of generous goods can be far worse."" But sometimes the situation of each component will be Reversal depends on the number of subscriptions in each group. For example, Yasheng Pharmaceuticals B (06855), which was listed recently, has more shares in Group A than Group B. ""Hey, let’s jump in the middle of the line and jump.""

4 points to distinguish new stock quality
It is nothing but money to make new shares. It is also necessary to draw money from it. It is worthwhile to choose a high-quality stock. This year's ""New Shares"" is Ao Dima Automobile (08418), which has risen 612.5%. It is known as the 2019 ""Frozen King"" in the middle of the game (00302). It will encounter Waterloo at the opening, and the price of the dark disk will only be low. The increase, the investors who borrowed from the exhibition, have to be eroded, which is really eye-popping. However, the stock price on the next day (November 1) was brave, and it surged 18.7% in a single day.
Zhang Zhiwei said that the quality of new shares is basically the same as that of listed companies:

The P/E ratio of the new shares in the industry is not too high, and it is ideal at a low level.
Understand the profitability of new shares and the purpose of fund raising. What is the profit base of the company in the past few years? Is there any negative news? It is necessary to know that some companies raise funds for the purpose of repaying debts, or use all the money for the dividend payout, and rely on listing to raise funds.
The company's profit and prospects are clear. A promising company is worthy of embarrassment, such as the beer stocks Budweiser Asia Pacific (01876) and the sporting goods stocks (06110), both of which have a domestic demand concept, so the two can be seen in the first line.
The sponsor of the new stock is also important and has certain indicators.

Be careful with speculative stocks
Sponsor sponsorship is well worthy of reference. Some sponsors recommend new stocks that generally have a good increase, so they are hailed as stronger sponsors, and naturally have more confidence. On the contrary, some sponsors recommend new shares to fall below the offer price, of course, be careful. Successfully drawing new shares is only the first step in silvering, and it is necessary to win the bag in time to win.
Zhang Zhiwei said frankly that there is actually no best stockpile strategy. The so-called price can rise or fall, new shares have the opportunity to rise straight like a cloud arrow, but also can be inserted into the waterless flower after the listing. For example, the fast food empire (01843) continued to fall after a slight increase in the listing on the last Wednesday (23rd); another example, Xiangzhong International (01871) listed on Thursday (24th), which is a record high of 1.48 yuan. However, the lowest price in recent days is 0.58 yuan.
Zhang Zhiwei suggested taking a segmentation and steadily to win the best return. ""The stock price of the new stock will be less if it is less."" He said that assuming five or six hands, the stock price will be reduced by 10% to 20% per liter; or the stock price will be reduced by 10% and then reduced. As for retail investors with less goods, Zhang Zhiwei generally uses the stock price to rise 30% or 50% as the stock boundary. He believes that the pricing of the new stock market is not ambiguous. If the price of the shares rises by 30% or 50% compared with the price, it is already excessively speculative.
When new shares can rise to 50% and continue to speculate, there has actually been a ""smell"" and it is not appropriate to continue holding. This is also puzzling. Is the pricing of listed companies confusing? This reflects that the speculation is too strong. ""If you draw eight to ten hands, you can leave one or two hands to the end of the game. But the reason is all gambling, the risk is too high, I will choose to do it.""
Looking at the trend of the latest semi-new stocks, the stock price has risen by more than 50%, and some are more than 500%. Zhang Zhiwei pointed out that the increase depends on individual stocks. It is a ""breaking scale only"", and the range can be fluctuating. The former Lu Master (03601), who had been speculating earlier, nearly doubled its share price. Zhang Zhiwei believes that there are several factors involved, including the goods and the high value of the parent company's 3,600 (601,360).
He urged investors to be cautious that new shares will accumulate such a large increase in a short period of time, so they cannot be deconstructed with any basic analysis and have completely left the fundamentals. In the stable market situation, the high-profile Asia-Pacific may still not have an accident, but if there is a negative trend such as the trade war ""dumping"" and the Hang Seng Index rushing back thousands of points, the market conditions will suddenly reverse, and these high-priced stocks will be the first. Investors should be mentally prepared to be sold.
Zhang Zhiwei’s message: “Do not succumb to greed and lose, and see if you want to accept it.” The high position is willing to let go, wrong and saved. Wanting to get back, Zhang Zhiwei said that Budweiser Asia Pacific (01876) is a good choice to consider. He analyzed that it is rare that its stock price is now adjusted back below 30 yuan, and Budweiser is the most promising stock among so many new or semi-new stocks.
Zhang Zhiwei continued, Budweiser's market value is nearly 400 billion yuan, compared with the blue-chip stock market value, Budweiser is within 10 big. He estimated that Budweiser will have a good chance to enter the Hang Seng Index in the future. Once things happen, passive funds such as Tracker Fund (02800) have to buy. In addition to Budweiser, this heavy newcomer, and then there is a focus on new stocks to attack Hong Kong.
The mainland milk powder giant China Feihe (06186) offered shares on Wednesday (30th) to next Tuesday (November 5th), issuing about 890 million shares, and wants to raise up to nearly 9 billion yuan. The offer price per share ranges from 7.5 yuan to 10 yuan; the entrance fee per hand is about 10,100 yuan. The management of the group revealed that the fundraising will be used for potential mergers and acquisitions, construction of factories and repayment of offshore debt. Zhang Zhiwei said that Feihe is a relatively large share of Budweiser and believes it will keep the market in mind. If you are interested in pumping new shares, you will start preparing for the war.
