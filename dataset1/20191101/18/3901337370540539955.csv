The centre-back has enjoyed his fair share of player spats over the years, especially with players from Barca's eternal rivals, and especially with their captain Sergio Ramos.

""I get on really well with Nacho, also with Lucas Vazquez,"" he said, according to Sport. 
""I wouldn't say Sergio Ramos and I are friends, but we have a cordial relationship and there's a lot of respect.
""It's the same with Alvaro Morata, who's now not at Real Madrid (he's at Atletico Madrid).
""I have always got on really well with them.""
