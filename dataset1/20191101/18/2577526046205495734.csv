Blizzard Announces Diablo IV
01 Nov 2019, 18:23 by Jason Schreier
Diablo IV is coming, Blizzard said today, finally confirming the much-anticipated sequel after years of speculation.
A new cinematic trailer for the game showed a group of treasure hunters fighting against what could be demons, or private equity executives.



Blizzard says the game takes place “many years after the events of Diablo III, after millions have been slaughtered by the actions of the High Heavens and Burning Hells alike. In the vacuum of power, a legendary name resurfaces.”
On stage at BlizzCon 2019, director Luis Barriga talked about how the game will aim to recreate the series’ “dark roots.” There’s no release date yet, but it’ll be on PC, PS4, and Xbox One. The first three classes showed were the barbarian, the sorceress, and the druid.
This is the fourth mainline entry in the long-running hack-n-loot series, which began in 1996. The most recent entry, Diablo III, came out in May 2012, recovering from a rocky launch to become one of the most popular PC games of all time.
