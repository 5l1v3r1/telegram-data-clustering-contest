Anthony Sir：最近睇你的 Youtube頻道，分享一個位於佐敦的細價樓，見到你的學員以402萬元買到一個約280呎的兩房單位，成功上車。我俾屋企人睇，講極佢哋都唔明，話一係就唔好買，一買就要買大啲，要為將來結婚生仔打算，但又嫌樓價貴喎，買樓上車的心態其實應該係點？我應該點同佢哋講呢？ 讀者Eunege
買樓上車，大有大買，細有細買！
買樓上車，大有大買，細有細買！ 鬼唔知龍頭大屋苑、高尚住宅區、交通方便、樓齡新、裝修靚、會所正、四房一廳、全海景、連埋個大天台，好咩？買得起先得，買得到就唔係上車啦！絕大部份買樓上車的朋友要做的就是，因應自己有限的預算，揀選最值得買的物業。
這就是所謂性價比高
就好似同學買的這個單位，雖然面積不到280呎，但開則靚，可以間到兩間房，可以放四乘六呎床兼且擺個衣櫃。樓齡雖然唔算新，但都唔算舊，30幾年，比附近很多40、50年的舊樓新得多，外觀保養不俗，最重要是足以做到30年按揭。 以質素相若的物業來說，402萬元這個價錢，即使深水埗、土瓜灣這些舊區都買唔到，更何況是鄰近高鐵西九龍站的優質地段呢？地段的價值，其實從市值租金已經可以反映出來。 同學這個單位用作自住，所以用另一位同學在區內的單位作評估，該單位的面積、樓齡都差不多，位置上比較靠近油麻地，算是冇這個單位咁好，都順利以1.4萬元租出，相信這個市場租值都相當實在。



成本低，回報高！普通人只看到的是，單位面積大唔大，間格裝修景觀靚唔靚，表面！投資者卻看到的是，單位可以賺幾多，成本幾多，回報幾多，專業！ 同學在今年新年前買入這個單位，當時按揭政策仍然是沿用舊制，即是只有450萬元以下最多做9成按揭，貸款上限360萬元，450萬至600萬元可以做8成按揭，600萬元以上最多只可以做6成按揭。 近年樓價反覆上升，400萬元以下，可以做盡9成按揭的單位非常搶手，買少見少，在舊制度之下，這個單位首期只需要42萬元，區內質素相若的單位，在2018年高位的時候成交約530萬元。
延伸閱讀：8月租金回報率回升！樓市見底的三大訊號
保守一點，打個折扣，假設持貨3年之後，升25%，以500萬元賣出，潛在賺幅接近100萬元，以42萬元首期計算，潛在回報接近2.5倍！ 同期如果買一個800萬元，普通人眼中覺得面積夠大、間格景觀裝修靚的單位，假設3年之後同樣升25%，但因為當時首期要40%，回報就只有25/40，潛在回報只有62.5%，遠低於同學的單位，你話係咪值得同學高興先？ 細屋變大屋 一間變幾間 這是細單位過去搶手的原因。
新政策之下，800萬元以下的單位都可以做到9成按揭，形勢有所不同，不過買咗都要供嘛，細單位始終LumpSum細，仍有優勢。 千萬不要小看細單位買樓上車就是這樣，以有限的預算，買最有投資價值的單位，幾十萬首期，幾年之後就變過百萬，再幾年之後就變幾百萬，細屋變大屋，一間變幾間，就係咁簡單，如果不能用投資者的眼光睇買樓，往後就只能原地踏步，離財務自由愈來愈遠。

Anthony Sir: I recently smashed your Youtube channel and shared a small price building in Jordan. I saw your student bought a two-bedroom unit of about 280 baht for 4.02 million yuan and successfully got on the bus. I am a squatter in the house, and I am very vocal about the slogan. If you buy it, you will buy it. If you buy it, you will have to buy a big cockroach. You have to plan for a marriage in the future, but you are also worried about the price of the building. Should the mentality be tied? Should I talk to the same channel? Reader Eunege
Buy a car on the upper floor, big buy, fine and fine to buy!
Buy a car on the upper floor, big buy, fine and fine to buy! Ghosts know the leading big house, high-end residential area, convenient transportation, new building age, decoration, clubhouse, four bedrooms and one hall, full sea view, and even a large rooftop, what? You can buy it first, buy it and get on the train! The vast majority of friends who buy a car upstairs have to choose the most worthwhile property in response to their limited budget.
This is the so-called cost-effective
It is like the unit bought by the classmates. Although the area is less than 280 baht, it can be opened to two rooms. It can be placed in four or six beds and a wardrobe. Although the building age is new, it is all old. In the past 30 years, it is much newer than many old buildings in the vicinity of 40 or 50 years. The appearance is good, and the most important thing is to make a 30-year mortgage. For properties with similar quality, the price of $4.02 million is even bought in the old districts of Sham Shui Po and To Kwa Wan. What is the quality of the vicinity of the West Kowloon Station? The value of the lot is actually reflected in the market rent. The classmate used this unit for self-occupation, so I used another classmate to evaluate the unit in the district. The size and age of the unit are similar. The location is relatively close to Yau Ma Tei. It is considered to be a good unit. Yuan rented out, I believe that this market rent value is quite real.



Low cost and high return! What ordinary people only see is that the unit area is large and large, and the decoration is beautiful, the surface! What investors see is that the unit can earn a lot, the cost is a lot, the return is a lot, professional! The classmates bought this unit before the new year. At that time, the mortgage policy was still based on the old system, that is, only up to 4.5 million yuan was used to make up to 90% of the mortgage, the loan limit was 3.6 million yuan, and the price of 4.5 million to 6 million yuan could be 80%. More than 10,000 yuan can only be used to make a mortgage of 60%. In recent years, property prices have risen repeatedly, below 4 million yuan. Units that can do 90% of mortgages are very popular. Buying less is less. Under the old system, this unit only needs 420,000 yuan in the first phase. The units with similar quality in the district, At the high level in 2018, the transaction was about 5.3 million yuan.

Conservative, a discount, assuming 2 years after holding the goods, rose 25%, sold for 5 million yuan, the potential profit is close to 1 million yuan, with a first phase of 420,000 yuan, the potential return is close to 2.5 times! If you buy a 8 million yuan in the same period, the average person thinks that the area is large enough and the room is decorated with a large area. It is assumed that the unit will rise by 25% after 3 years, but because the first period is 40%, the return is only 25/40. The return is only 62.5%, which is far lower than the classmates. Is your class worthy of classmates happy? The small house has become a big house. It has become a few reasons.
Under the new policy, units below 8 million yuan can achieve 90% mortgage, the situation is different, but you have to buy it, the fine unit is always LumpSum fine, there are still advantages. Don't underestimate the small units to buy the upstairs car. This is the case with a limited budget. The unit with the most investment value is hundreds of thousands of initial periods. After a few years, it has changed to a million. In a few years, it will change to a few hundred. 10,000, the thin house becomes a big house, and the change of a room is simple. If you can't buy the building with the eyes of investors, you can only stay in place in the future, and the financial freedom is getting farther and farther.
