研究：麻疹恐使免疫系統失憶 無法對抗其他疾病

（中央社倫敦31日綜合外電報導）參與相關研究的科學家今天表示，麻疹的危險性比醫學界目前普遍所認知為高，因為病毒可造成免疫系統「失憶」，破壞人體對其他疾病的抵抗力。
兩項同時發表的研究結果首度揭露，作為傳染性最強的疾病之一，麻疹如何「重新設定」人體免疫系統，使其恢復到嬰幼兒般的不成熟狀態，對感染僅具有限免疫能力。
此外，相關研究結果有助說明，為何孩童得過麻疹後，往往容易感染其他疾病，也凸顯有些國家日益抗拒幼兒接種疫苗的危險性。
路透社報導，各地民眾對疫苗的信任感降低進而使接種人數減少，已導致麻疹疫情出現，這又可能使得流行性感冒、白喉及結核病等其他危險的疾病重現。
英國維康桑格研究院（Wellcome Sanger Institute）和劍橋大學（Cambridge University）博士後研究員佩特洛娃（Velislava Petrova）是其中一項研究的負責人之一，她指出，麻疹對人體造成的影響包括「免疫失憶」，也就是說，「免疫系統忘了以往如何應對感染」。
美國霍華休斯醫學中心（Howard Hughes Medical Institute）研究員艾勒吉（Stephen Elledge）是另一項研究的負責人之一。他表示，研究結果「非常強有力地證明，麻疹病毒實際上會摧毀人體免疫系統」。
麻疹病毒會引發咳嗽、出疹和高燒，也可能引起具有潛在致命性的肺炎和腦炎等併發症。
有兩劑自1960年代即被使用，且已證實安全有效的疫苗可對抗麻疹，但世界衛生組織（WHO）專家約3週前警告，全球各地有許多未曾接種的民眾，且人數有上升趨勢。
世界衛生組織數據顯示，今年前3個月全球未接種麻疹疫苗的人數是去年同期的4倍。
為了解麻疹對人體免疫系統的影響，兩組科學家在荷蘭觀察研究了一群未接種麻疹疫苗的孩童。
在其中一項研究，科學家給源自26名孩童的抗體作基因測序，時間是在他們感染麻疹病毒前及感染後約40至50天內。研究和驗血結果顯示，感染後，這些孩童先前所擁有對其他疾病的抵抗力消失。
根據另一項研究結果，麻疹足以摧毀存在於孩童體內11%至73%的保護性抗體。（譯者：陳韻聿/核稿：張佑之）1081101

Research: Measles can cause immune system amnesia, unable to fight other diseases
01 Nov 2019, 18:40 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
Scientists involved in the study said today that the risk of measles is higher than that currently recognized by the medical community because the virus can cause the immune system to ""amnesia"" and destroy the body's resistance to other diseases.
Two simultaneous published results revealed for the first time that as one of the most contagious diseases, measles how to “reset” the body's immune system to restore it to an immature state like an infant, and has only limited immunity to infection.
In addition, the results of relevant research help to explain why children are prone to other diseases after having measles, and it is also highlighted that some countries are increasingly resistant to the risk of vaccination for young children.
Reuters reported that people's trust in the vaccine has decreased and the number of vaccinations has decreased, which has led to measles outbreaks, which may reproduce other dangerous diseases such as influenza, diphtheria and tuberculosis.
One of the leaders of the study, one of the directors of the Wellcome Sanger Institute and Cambridge University postdoctoral researcher, Velislava Petrova, pointed out that the impact of measles on the human body includes ""Immune amnesia,"" that is, ""the immune system forgets how to deal with infection in the past.""
Stephen Elledge, a researcher at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in the United States, is one of the directors of another study. He said the findings ""very strongly prove that the measles virus actually destroys the body's immune system.""
The measles virus can cause coughs, rashes and high fever, and can also cause potentially fatal complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis.
Two doses have been used since the 1960s, and safe and effective vaccines have been shown to fight measles, but World Health Organization (WHO) experts warned about three weeks ago that there are many people who have not been vaccinated around the world, and the number is on the rise.
According to World Health Organization data, the number of people who have not been vaccinated against measles worldwide in the first three months of this year is four times that of the same period last year.
To understand the effects of measles on the human immune system, two groups of scientists in the Netherlands observed a group of children who were not vaccinated against measles.
In one of the studies, scientists sequenced antibodies from 26 children in the first 40 to 50 days before they were infected with the measles virus and after infection. Studies and blood tests have shown that these children's previous resistance to other diseases disappeared after infection.
According to another study, measles is sufficient to destroy 11% to 73% of protective antibodies present in children. (Translator: Chen Yunqi / Approved: Zhang Youzhi) 1081101
