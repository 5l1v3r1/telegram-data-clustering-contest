中國「拉達克」被劃入印度直轄區，印度稱中方無權「評論內政」
01 Nov 2019, 06:25 by Abby Huang


我們想讓你知道的是由於中國主張拉達克是中國領土，中國外交部發言人耿爽說，印方通過單方面修改國內法律和行政區劃的方式，挑戰中國主權權益，這一做法是「非法、無效的」。



印巴衝突熱點「喀什米爾」的獨立地位遭廢後，印度政府日前正式將該區劃分為2個中央直轄區，總理莫迪誓言要為血腥的喀什米爾地區帶來「光明未來」，不過領土爭議也讓中國外交部稱此舉「非法而無效」。不過，印度外交部稍後發表聲明，表示這是印度內政，中國無權發表評論。
印度政府在今年8月5日做出重大決定，廢除印度1949年以來賦予查摩與喀什米爾省獨立於《憲法》之外的特殊地位，取消喀什米爾特殊自治權，並進駐數萬名額外部隊封鎖當地，點燃與鄰近的中國、巴基斯坦的緊張關係。


一次槓上巴基斯坦和中國！印度取消「查謨－喀什米爾邦」自治權、實施「全境封鎖」


近3個月後，印度當局昨日（10月31日）正式宣布，將喀什米爾地區劃分成2個中央直轄區，把過去的查摩與喀什米爾省（Jammu and Kashmir）分為「查摩與喀什米爾中央直轄行政區」及「拉達克中央直轄行政區」，直接由首都德里統治，更加強化對當地的控制。
長期以來，喀什米爾地區一直是世界上最危險的爆發點之一，並且是高度軍事化的地區。喀什米爾長期處於分裂狀態，分處印度、巴基斯坦和中國三方的控制：喀什米爾北部由巴基斯坦控制、南部由印度控制，而位於喀什米爾東南部的拉達克地區（Ladakh）東部、緊鄰中國新疆的阿克賽欽（Aksai Chin）區，目前中國聲稱握有主權。

印度政府在8月5日提出了一項法案，將查摩與喀什米爾的行政地位從「邦」改為「中央直轄區」，此法於昨日（10月31日）生效，也任命這2個直轄區的首長。
印度總理莫迪（Narendra Modi）在故鄉古茶拉底省（Gujarat），站在印度獨立運動英雄巴特爾（Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel）巨大雕像旁，誓言為血腥的喀什米爾地區帶來「光明未來」。
與此同時，喀什米爾地方當局部署數萬名政府軍，進入高度警戒，防範叛亂攻擊和反印度示威抗議。配備防彈裝備的警察部隊和準軍事部隊，在首府斯利那加（Srinagar）人口稠密的老城區，及其他喀什米爾谷地（Kashmir valley）動盪地區巡邏。

喀什米爾是誰的「內政」？印、中互稱對方無權
（中央社）印度昨日成立2中央直轄區，中國外交部稱此舉是非法而無效的，印度外交部稍後聲明表示，這是印度內政，中國無權發表評論。
印度外交部發言人庫瑪（Raveesh Kumar）在一份聲明中表示，中國深知印度在此一問題的一貫和明確立場，把過去的查摩與喀什米爾省（Jammu and Kashmir）分為查摩與喀什米爾中央直轄行政區及拉達克中央直轄行政區，完全是印度的內政。
庫瑪說，印度不希望中國等國對印度內部事務發表評論，就像印度拒絕評論他國內部事務一樣。他說，「中國繼續在查摩與喀什米爾中央直轄區及拉達克中央直轄區占領大片土地」，根據所謂的1963年中國與巴基斯坦邊界協定，還從巴基斯坦占領的喀什米爾「非法奪取印度領土」。
由於中國主張拉達克是中國領土，中國外交部發言人耿爽在記者會上答覆媒體提問時說，印方通過單方面修改國內法律和行政區劃的方式，挑戰中國主權權益。這一做法是「非法、無效的」，不會改變有關地區在中國實際控制下的事實，不會產生任何效力。
耿爽說，中方敦促印方切實尊重中方領土主權，恪守雙方達成的有關協定，以實際行動維護中印邊境地區和平與安寧，為兩國妥善解決邊界問題創造有利條件。
拉達克現由中國、印度和巴基斯坦各控制一部分。拉達克王1684年與西藏簽署條約，臣屬西藏達賴喇嘛，拉達克王於清代雍正以後接受中國皇帝冊封，且由清駐藏大臣節制，中華人民共和國因而主張拉達克是中國領土的一部分。
至於巴基斯坦，印度與巴國1947年以後幾次戰爭爭奪喀什米爾主權，之後在聯合國調停下，雙方以所占領的地區畫出控制線，印度在所控制地區設立併入拉達克的查摩與喀什米爾省，巴基斯坦則在所控制區域成立自由喀什米爾政府。
然而，中國所占領的阿克賽欽（Aksai Chin）及巴基斯坦承認是中國領土的喀喇崑崙走廊，印度都主張是喀什米爾的一部分，庫瑪因而指控中國「非法奪取印度領土」。


喀什米爾不僅是印巴角力戰場，還有一旁虎視眈眈的中國


馬來西亞表同情，遭印度網友聯合抵制
《中央廣播電台》報導，位在喜馬拉雅山區的查摩喀什米爾邦，是由穆斯林佔多數的喀什米爾山谷（Kashmir Valley）、印度人為主的查摩地區（Jammu），以及偏遠高地的佛教徒地區拉達克（Ladakh）組成。印度政府自8月宣布廢止《憲法》賦予喀什米爾地區的特殊地位後，隨即全面封鎖當地，包括中斷電話、手機與網路，並實施宵禁，派大軍鎮守，同時印度人也將得以移居喀什米爾，購置產業，並在當地擔任公職。
印度控制的喀什米爾是印度境內唯一以穆斯林人口為主的地區，馬來西亞的人口也以穆斯林佔多數，因而馬哈迪對喀什米爾人民的處境表達了同情。馬來西亞首相馬哈迪（Mahathir Mohamad）更於9月在聯合國大會上，指稱印度「侵略並佔領」喀什米爾，引發印度的強烈反彈，可能重創大馬的棕櫚油生意。報導指出，大批印度人民在社群媒體以「杯葛馬來西亞」（#BoycottMalaysia）的標籤，表達他們的憤怒，並盛傳印度即將對馬來西亞棕櫚油課徵更高的關稅。

After the independence of India-Pakistan conflict hotspot ""Kashmir"" was abolished, the Indian government officially divided the district into two central territories, and Prime Minister Modi vowed to bring a ""bright future"" to the bloody Kashmir region, but the territory The dispute also made the Chinese Foreign Ministry claim that the move was ""illegal and ineffective."" However, the Indian Foreign Ministry issued a statement later saying that this is India's internal affairs and China has no right to comment.

Who is the ""internal government"" of Kashmir? India and China claim that the other party has no right
(Central News Agency) India established 2 Central Territory District yesterday. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said the move was illegal and invalid. The Indian Foreign Ministry stated later that this is India's internal affairs and China has no right to comment.
Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said in a statement that China is well aware of India's consistent and clear position on this issue and divided the past Jammu and Kashmir provinces into Chamo. It is entirely the internal affairs of India with the Central Administrative Region of Kashmir and the Central Administrative Region of Ladakh.
Kumar said that India does not want China and other countries to comment on India's internal affairs, just as India refuses to comment on the internal affairs of other countries. He said, ""China continues to occupy large areas of land in the Chamor and Kashmir Central Territory and the Ladakh Central Territory."" According to the so-called 1963 China-Pakistan border agreement, it also illegally seized Indian territory from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. "".""
Since China advocates that Ladakh is a Chinese territory, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Yan Shuang replied to the media at a press conference and said that the Indian side challenged China's sovereign rights by unilaterally modifying domestic laws and administrative divisions. This practice is ""illegal and ineffective"" and will not change the facts of the relevant region under the actual control of China and will not have any effect.
Yu Shuang said that China urges the Indian side to earnestly respect China's territorial sovereignty, abide by the relevant agreements reached between the two sides, and take concrete actions to safeguard peace and tranquility in the Sino-Indian border region and create favorable conditions for the two countries to properly resolve the border issue.
Ladakh is now controlled by China, India and Pakistan. King Ladakh signed a treaty with Tibet in 1684. The tribe was a Tibetan Dalai Lama. The Ladakh king accepted the canonization of the Chinese emperor after the Qing dynasty, and the Qing dynasty minister tempered. The People’s Republic of China therefore advocated that Ladakh is China. Part of the territory.
As for Pakistan, India and Pakistan competed for Kashmir’s sovereignty in several wars after 1947. After the United Nations mediation, the two sides plotted the control line in the occupied area. India established the Chamo and Ladakh in the controlled area. In the province of Kashmir, Pakistan established the Free Kashmir government in the area under its control.
However, Aksai Chin, which is occupied by China, and Pakistan recognize the Karakorum Corridor of Chinese territory. India claims to be part of Kashmir, and Kumar accuses China of ""illegally capturing Indian territory.""


Kashmir is not only a battlefield between India and Pakistan, but also a China that looks at it.
