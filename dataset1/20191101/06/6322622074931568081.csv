商业环境改善 大马制造业PMI创6个月新高
01 Nov 2019, 06:38 by Cameron Chong
（吉隆坡1日讯）根据IHS Markit，随着商业环境改善，10月大马制造业采购经理人指数（PMI）升至49.3，创下6个月新高水平。
报告指，该指数恢复到与历史平均水平大致上一致的位置，9月为47.9。
IHS Markit首席经济师Chris Williamson说：“PMI生产增长的主要指标已升至一年来的最高水平，大致表明经济年增长率超过5%。”
增长是由新订单和新产量所驱动，两个指标均显示出改善的迹象。
HIS表示，就目前水平而言，调查的产出指数与年产量增长率约5.5%一致。
不过，报导指外围环境在第四季度初变得更具挑战性，导致出口订单连续第二个月下降。
IHS Markit强调，中国和欧洲是造成需求疲软的两个主因。
尽管如此，随着新订单总体指数上升，调查数据表明，内需条件帮助提供了抵消外部需求下滑的主要动力。

Business environment improvement Malaysia's manufacturing PMI hit a six-month high
01 Nov 2019, 06:38 by Cameron Chong
KUALA LUMPUR (Aug. 1) According to IHS Markit, the Malaysian Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 49.3 in October, setting a new six-month high.
According to the report, the index returned to a position that was roughly consistent with the historical average, which was 47.9 in September.
Chris Williamson, chief economist at IHS Markit, said: ""The main indicator of PMI production growth has risen to its highest level in a year, roughly indicating that the annual economic growth rate exceeds 5%.""
Growth is driven by new orders and new production, both indicators showing signs of improvement.
HIS said that at the current level, the output index of the survey is consistent with an annual growth rate of about 5.5%.
However, the report said that the external environment became more challenging at the beginning of the fourth quarter, causing export orders to decline for the second consecutive month.
IHS Markit emphasized that China and Europe are the two main causes of weak demand.
Nonetheless, as the overall index of new orders rises, survey data suggests that domestic demand conditions have helped provide the main driver behind the decline in external demand.
