On-loan midfielder George Cooper tops Plymouth Argyle player ratings for October
He made an excellent return to action after suffering a broken nose and fractured cheekbone
01 Nov 2019, 06:00 by Chris Errington
George Cooper was the Plymouth Argyle player-of-the-month for October, according to the Plymouth Live ratings given after every game.
The loan signing from Peterborough United had suffered a broken nose and a fractured cheekbone in the Pilgrims’ 1-0 win at Mansfield Town at the end of September.
Cooper missed Argyle’s first two matches in October due to those facial injuries.
However, the 22-year-old returned to action only a fortnight afterwards.
Cooper wore a protective mask when he played as a second half substitute in the 1-1 draw away to Swindon Town in League Two.
It was Cooper who provided the assist when Joel Grant scored the Pilgrims’ late equaliser.
Cooper did not need the protective mask any more when he lined up for Argyle in the 2-0 home league win against Carlisle United the following Saturday.
His average Plymouth Live rating for October was 7.00 from five games.
That included a nine out of 10 when the Pilgrims beat Carl Fletcher’s Leyton Orient 4-0 at Home Park.
The runner-up to Cooper was midfielder Antoni Sarcevic, who average 6.57 from seven games.
Sarcevic also finished second in the September ratings, when the top marks went to defender Will Aimson.
There was a nine out of 10 for Sarcevic in Argyle’s 3-0 EFL Trophy win at Swindon on October 8.
In third place, behind Cooper and Sarcevic, was defender Scott Wootton, who averaged 6.50 from six matches.
