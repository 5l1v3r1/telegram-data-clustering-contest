Rant and Rave: Reader may have lost rings, but appreciates the help to find them
01 Nov 2019, 06:00 by Submitted by Seattle Times readers
RAVE to the Washington State Department of Transportation staff who helped me file a report when I realized I lost my rings at a roadside rest stop along I-90. Your kindness and concern helped more than you know, and I was grateful to hear that a maintenance crew member made a special trip to look for the rings. Sadly, the rings may be lost for good, but you all made a rough time easier for me.
RANT to independent caregivers that soon start drumming the patient’s relatives up for more and more money. Best to deal with agencies. There are real vultures out there.
