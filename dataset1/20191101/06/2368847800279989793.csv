台師大教授被囚北京1年 150台灣人在大陸失聯

01 Nov 2019, 06:54

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】台師大國際人力資源發展研究所退休副教授施正屏去年在中國失蹤。現被證實關押在北京，但家屬一直不敢求助。海基會說，已接獲149件台人在大陸失聯案件。專家相信，很多台商面臨此狀況，家屬不敢求援。
據自由時報報導，台師大國際人力資源發展研究所表示，施正屏去年2月已退休。施友人說，施正屏今年56歲，是提早辦理退休，退休後曾在政大EMBA開課，一週一堂，後來也擔任中國國企「華夏集團」首席經濟學家，經常往返兩岸。
友人透露最後一次與施正屏用LINE聯絡，已是去年7月的事，施的臉書也停留在7月底，他問過施太太有關施正屏的動向，但他的太太說「去修行了」。
5、6月，施正屏的女兒在美國的畢業典禮，向來疼愛女兒的施沒有出現，引發懷疑。
報導說，施正屏去年8月在中國失蹤，但家屬擔心變成「李明哲第二」，始終不願透過正式管道向海基會、陸委會求助，官方近日曾去電施家詢問，家屬卻告知，人在中國做研究，一切很好。
友人表示，其實營救施正屏在友人圈也出現兩派意見，不過，基於尊重家屬，大家都保持低調。友人說，他們共同的台商朋友6、7月時曾透過管道詢問，才得知施正屏以國安理由被關押在北京，北京的軍方與國安人員還特別提醒，不要再多問。
在此之前，《中央社》報導，台灣屏東縣枋寮鄉政顧問李孟居8月20日在大陸失聯，中共國台辦發言人馬曉光9月11日在例行記者會上確認，李孟居因「涉嫌從事危害國家安全的犯罪活動」而被拘捕。
李孟居被拘前一直關注香港「反送中」。據運動屏東縣枋寮鄉長陳亞麟說，8月20日，李孟居告訴他「人在香港邊境，想過關深圳」，並傳了一張中共軍隊集結的照片，之後便失聯了。
9月18日，海基會舉行例行新聞背景說明會，對於李孟居入境深圳失聯一事，海基會發言人蔡孟君說，始終未獲中共海峽兩岸關係協會回應；而另一位南台灣兩岸關係協會聯合會主席蔡金樹去年失蹤後，海基會也多次發函海協會，均沒有收到任何訊息。
蔡孟君還表示，自2016年5月20日以來，海基會共受理了149件台灣人在大陸失聯的案件，其中有67人至今仍然毫無音訊。
台北教育大學台灣文化研究所教授李筱峰表示，當這些類似的案子一個一個浮出來之後，他越有理由相信，還有很多台商也是面臨這種狀況，家屬也不敢求援，而李孟居和蔡金樹的案子很可能只是個案。
他批評，中共這種抓人的手法，顯示它們政權的本質，不只專制極權，還很笨，智慧很低，這樣的高壓手法，不會贏得台灣人的心。他建議，蔡英文政府除了努力營救這些人之外，也要把中共的惡行宣揚出來，昭告國人，並告訴全世界。

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 01, 2019] Shi Zhengping, a retired associate professor at the International Human Resources Development Institute of the National Taiwan Normal University, was missing in China last year. He is now confirmed to be detained in Beijing, but his family has been afraid to ask for help. The SEF said that it has received 149 cases of Taiwanese lost in the mainland. Experts believe that many Taiwanese businessmen are facing this situation and their families are afraid to ask for help.
According to the Free Times, the International Human Resources Development Institute of Taishi University said that Shi Zhengping had retired in February last year. Shi Youren said that Shi Zhengping was 56 years old and was retiring early. After retirement, he started his class at the Zhengda EMBA. He also served as the chief economist of the Chinese state-owned ""Huaxia Group"" and often traveled to and from the two sides.
The friend revealed that the last contact with Shi Zhengping was LINE. It was the last July. Shi’s Facebook also stayed at the end of July. He asked Mrs. Shi about Shi Zhengping’s movements, but his wife said, “Go to practice.”
In May and June, Shi Zhengping’s daughter’s graduation ceremony in the United States did not appear to affect her daughter, causing suspicion.
The report said that Shi Zhengping had disappeared in China in August last year, but his family members worried that they would become ""Li Mingzhe's second"". They were always reluctant to seek help from the SEF and the MAC through formal channels. The official recently went to the electricity and asked questions, but the family informed. People do research in China and everything is fine.
Friends said that in fact, Shi Zhengping also had two opinions in the circle of friends. However, based on respect for family members, everyone kept a low profile. Friends said that their common Taiwanese business friends had inquired through the pipeline in June and July that they learned that Shi Zhengping was detained in Beijing on the grounds of national security. The military and national security personnel in Beijing also reminded me not to ask more.
Prior to this, ""Central News Agency"" reported that Taiwan's Pingtung County, the township government adviser Li Mengju lost contact on the mainland on August 20, the spokesman of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Taiwan Affairs Office Ma Xiaoguang confirmed at a regular press conference on September 11 that Li Mengju was ""suspicious"" Arrested while engaging in criminal activities that endanger national security.
Li Mengju has been paying attention to Hong Kong's ""reverse delivery"" before he was detained. According to Chen Yalin, the head of the Pingtung County, the town of Pingtung County, on August 20, Li Mengju told him that ""people are on the border of Hong Kong and want to pass through Shenzhen"" and passed a photo of the CCP's army assembly, and then lost.
On September 18, the SEF held a regular news briefing. For the incident of Li Mengju’s entry into Shenzhen, the SEF spokesperson Cai Mengjun said that he has never been responded to by the Cross-Strait Relations Association; another South-Taiwan relationship After the president of the Association of Associations, Cai Jinshu, disappeared last year, the SEF also sent letters to the ARATS several times and did not receive any message.
Cai Mengjun also said that since May 20, 2016, the SEF has accepted 149 cases of Taiwanese lost in the mainland, and 67 of them still have no news.
Li Yufeng, a professor at the Institute of Taiwanese Culture at Taipei University of Education, said that when these similar cases emerged one by one, the more reason he believes, the more Taiwanese businessmen are facing this situation, and the family members dare not ask for help, while Li Mengju and Cai Jinshu The case is probably just a case.
He criticized that the CCP’s method of arresting people shows the essence of their political power. It is not only authoritarian, but also stupid and low-minded. Such a high-handed approach will not win the hearts of Taiwanese. He suggested that in addition to trying to rescue these people, Tsai’s English government should also publicize the CCP’s evil deeds, tell the people and tell the world.
