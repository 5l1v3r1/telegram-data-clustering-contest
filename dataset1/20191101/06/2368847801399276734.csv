深圳公廁要掃碼付費 超時自動開門惹遊客不滿

01 Nov 2019, 06:45

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】深圳一處風景區近期開通，卻因設置了「智能公廁」，遊客需用手機刷QR碼付費才能使用，給民眾帶來諸多不便，引發民眾爭議。
綜合媒體報導，深圳羅湖區淘金山綠道上月剛開通，卻因設置了4間需經手機刷QR code支付2元後才能使用的智能公廁惹來爭議。
有民眾反映，掃「QR code」收費的過程會耽誤時間，帶來不便，還有遊客質疑收費2元的合理性。
此外，每個公廁每次限時使用20分鐘，如果超時門會自動打開，非常尷尬，令遊客極為不滿。
據公廁管理員透露，因為平時來遊玩的市民都會經過此地，而離這裏最近的免費公廁約為1公里，大家都會就近使用付費的公廁。
一位來淘金山綠道散步的老人表示，他自己會操作掃碼支付，但據他瞭解，與他同齡的不少老人大多不會操作。年輕人都無所謂的，主要是老年人，一些老人拿的是老年機，也不會掃碼，著急進去的時候不太方便。
還有的老人表示，覺得不應該收費，淘金山綠道是一個公園，公園是公共娛樂場所，既然是公共的，應該給人方便，就應該是免費的。而且出門沒有帶手機，著急上廁所怎麼辦？
對此，有網民抱怨稱：「萬一肚子不舒服還沒解決完，門就開了不就曝光了？」
還有人表示：「保潔需要錢，收費是可以理解的，但限時就尷尬了，難道遇到沒解決完還要穿好褲子出來再掃一下QR code嗎？」
據報，近幾年，中國大陸行動支付得到迅速普及，許多人用手機來支付自己房屋的水電費、瓦斯費，當然還包括乘坐的士、購買物品，統統可以用手機一刷了之。像青島這樣的一些大城市中，甚至連路邊的煎餅攤販都會放上QR Code或是二維條碼，因為許多人買煎餅也是刷手機來支付的。目前，中國人使用最普遍的行動支付平臺主要是微信和支付寳。
一位自稱在中國工作了十幾年的臺干在臺灣社交媒體PTT上發貼文稱，手機支付的方式之所以在中國大陸盛行，是因為中國太落後。
這名臺干在帖文中表示：在中國大陸，便利商店和銀行不多，而且便利商店中也不一定會有提款機，往往去取點錢還需要走比較遠的路。再加上中國大陸的提款機質量又很「爛」，銀行卡常常會被機器「吃掉」，取錢很不方便，所以人們不喜歡現金支付。
帖文還指出，中國大陸的跨行提款手續費很高，就算是在同一個城市內的不同銀行之間，都會被收人民幣2至4元（人民幣，下同）不等的手續費；如果是不同的城市不同的銀行手續費收得「更是坑人」，是按照交易額的百分比來收的。
臺干在帖文中透露說，還有一個原因是中國大陸的假鈔非常多，甚至連提款機裡取出來的現金裡都有可能會有拿到假鈔的情形，取點錢還得自備驗鈔筆，實在太麻煩。
帖文表示，由於上述原因，導致行動支付在中國大陸盛行。
事實上早在2017年8月上旬，就曾有日本媒體發文指出，中國大陸行動支付迅速普及化背後的原因是偽鈔太多，導致中國老百姓對現金缺乏信賴感。即使海外輿論界一直有聲音批評中國大陸的行動支
付的交易記錄，很可能會被中共政府機構利用來對民眾進行監視，但在中國大陸偽鈔現象嚴重的背景下，用行動支付就不需要帶現金出門，方便又安心。因此，行動支付能夠在中國大陸迅速盛行起來。

Shenzhen public toilets need to scan the code to pay for the timeout automatically open the door to provoke tourists dissatisfaction

01 Nov 2019, 06:45

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time, November 01, 2019] A scenic spot in Shenzhen was recently opened, but because of the ""smart public toilet"", visitors need to use the mobile phone to brush the QR code to use it, which brings inconvenience to the public and sparks public controversy. .
According to comprehensive media reports, the Taojinshan Greenway in Luohu District, Shenzhen has just opened last month, but it has been controversial because it has set up 4 smart public toilets that need to be paid 2 yuan by mobile phone QR code.
Some people have reported that the process of sweeping the ""QR code"" fee will delay the time and cause inconvenience, and tourists will question the reasonableness of the charge of 2 yuan.
In addition, each public toilet is used for 20 minutes each time. If the time-out door will open automatically, it is very embarrassing and extremely unsatisfactory for tourists.
According to the public toilet administrator, because the people who usually come to play will pass through this place, and the nearest free public toilet is about 1 km, everyone will use the paid public toilet nearby.
An old man who came to the Taojin Mountain Greenway said that he would operate the scan code payment, but according to him, many elderly people of his age would not operate. Young people do not care, mainly the elderly, some old people take the old machine, and will not scan the code, it is not convenient when they are in a hurry.
Some old people said that they should not charge. The Jinjinshan Greenway is a park. The park is a public entertainment place. Since it is public, it should be convenient for people. It should be free. And how do I go out without a mobile phone and go to the toilet?
In response, some netizens complained: ""If the stomach is uncomfortable and has not been resolved, the door will be opened and not exposed?""
Others said: ""Cleaning requires money, the fee is understandable, but it is awkward in a limited time. Is it necessary to wear pants and then scan the QR code if it is not solved?""
It has been reported that in recent years, mobile payment in mainland China has been rapidly spread. Many people use mobile phones to pay for their own water and electricity bills, gas bills, and of course, taxis and purchases, all of which can be swiped by mobile phones. In some big cities like Qingdao, even street-side pancake vendors will put QR Code or 2D barcodes, because many people buy pancakes and pay by mobile phones. At present, the most popular mobile payment platforms used by Chinese are mainly WeChat and Alipay.
A Taiwanese self-proclaimed to work in China for more than a decade has posted on Taiwan's social media PTT that the reason why mobile payment is popular in mainland China is because China is too backward.
The Taiwanese official said in the post: In mainland China, there are not many convenience stores and banks, and there are not necessarily cash machines in convenience stores. It is often necessary to take a long way to get some money. In addition, the quality of ATMs in mainland China is very bad. Bank cards are often ""eaten"" by machines. It is inconvenient to withdraw money, so people do not like cash payments.
The post also pointed out that the cross-bank withdrawal fee in mainland China is very high, even if it is between different banks in the same city, it will be charged a fee of 2 to 4 yuan (RMB, the same below); It is different bank charges for different cities. The income is “more crowded” and is collected according to the percentage of the transaction amount.
Taiwan’s post revealed in the post that there is another reason for the large number of counterfeit banknotes in mainland China. Even the cash taken out from the cash machine may have counterfeit banknotes. It is too much trouble to prepare the banknotes.
According to the post, due to the above reasons, action payments are prevalent in mainland China.
In fact, as early as the beginning of August 2017, there was a Japanese media report saying that the reason behind the rapid popularization of mobile payment in mainland China was that there were too many counterfeit banknotes, which led to the lack of trust of Chinese people in cash. Even overseas public opinion circles have always voiced criticism of China’s action
The transaction records paid are likely to be used by the CCP government agencies to monitor the public. However, in the context of the serious counterfeit banknotes in mainland China, it is not necessary to bring cash out with the action payment, which is convenient and reassuring. Therefore, mobile payments can quickly become popular in mainland China.
