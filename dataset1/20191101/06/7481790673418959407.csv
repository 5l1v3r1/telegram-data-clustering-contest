日経平均終値、７６円安の２万２８５０円…小幅に下落

01 Nov 2019, 06:24

　１日の東京株式市場で日経平均株価（２２５種）は小幅に下落し、終値は前日比７６円２７銭安の２万２８５０円７７銭だった。
　米国と中国の貿易協議を巡り、中国当局の関係者が包括的な合意に疑念を抱いていると報じられたことで対立激化への懸念が再燃した。取引開始直後には前日の米株安を受けて一時、２００円超下落する場面もみられた。午後には一部の値下がりした銘柄が買い戻され、小幅な値動きにとどまった。
　市場では「国内企業の決算内容によって、個別銘柄ごとに注文が分かれやすく、しばらくは小幅な値動きが続く」（大手証券）との見方もある。
