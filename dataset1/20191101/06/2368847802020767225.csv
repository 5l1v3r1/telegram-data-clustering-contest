潘石屹「看事不好」也要跑？網友：絕頂聰明

01 Nov 2019, 06:17

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】潘石屹清倉SOHO中國的消息曝光後，震驚大陸。目前中國經濟現狀堪憂，房地產市場未來可能出現塌方危機。有網友感嘆，「潘石屹絕對是個聰明人，誰能先跑一秒鐘就多一分活下來的希望！」
中國房地產巨頭潘石屹控制的SOHO中國，擬以80億美元將SOHO中國的核心資產，8大辦公樓全部售出，包括北京的望京SOHO。消息爆光後，引起輿論震動，網上有人急呼「不要讓潘石屹跑了!」
大陸《財新網》引述消息人士稱，SOHO中國將以分批打包的方式尋求出售8大資產，計劃所有交易在未來2年內完成，這8個項目總價值為500億∼600億元人民幣。潘石屹計劃清空中國資產，轉向海外投資。
法廣分析說，潘石屹是一個房產開發商，他要把SOHO賣出去，要清倉，應該說也無可非議。然而潘石屹出售SOHO似乎讓人感到不吉祥，許多人突然有了泰坦尼克號船上乘客那樣的感覺。
外界認為，目前美中貿易戰懸而未決，中國經濟現狀堪憂，潘石屹此番大手筆賣樓，釋放出大陸房地產市場未來可能出現危機的信號，房市可能面臨大降溫。
網名「財經太極貓」貼文稱：「講真，潘石屹絕對是個聰明人。這個時候形勢已經非常明朗，哪怕是腰斬哪怕是降價80%都得賣！未來的危機早就已經注定，誰能先跑一秒鐘就多一分活下來的希望！」
陳彼得咖啡屋：「上個世紀90年代，潘石屹從海南房地產泡沫中成功逃頂，回到北京創立SOHO。20多年過去了，潘石屹又在砸鍋賣鐵，一副勝利大逃亡的樣子。前有李嘉誠，後有潘石屹都是曾經的逃頂大師，都是城市的核心地段。大師都走了，中國史詩般的房地產上漲行情可能真的結束了。千萬不要在山頂站崗,投資的房子想賣不好賣，不行就8折7折，一定要走。」
豪華七對調侃說：「富人的選擇是這個社會的風向標」。上林隱者也調侃道：「我也強烈看空，把家裡能賣的房子全賣了。」
張平在「跑得比李嘉誠晚幾年 潘石屹為何要清倉大甩賣？」一文裡寫道：「地產大佬潘石屹賣完了大樓，又要買資產，主要是不看好房地產後市，想早日回籠資金，落袋為安。同時又將把自己企業的高負債率給降下來，以便於企業的轉型。」
「我們認為，在目前國內經濟下行的情況下，拋售資產，選擇現金為王，對房企是很有必要，因為有了現金才能更好的償還債務，才能收購其他中小房企，更好的運作下去。潘石屹此舉做得也是非常明智。」
今日聊城頭條說：「繼李嘉誠大量拋售中國房產後，房地產大佬潘石屹也80億美金拋售物業，而且甚至不惜拋售核心地段物業，看來老潘對未來的經濟是相當的謹慎！」
據報導，潘石屹此次計劃出售的是所謂「八大金剛」，包括北京的望京SOHO、光華路SOHO2期、前門大街、麗澤SOHO，以及上海的外灘SOHO、SOHO復興廣場、古北SOHO和SOHO天山廣場項目。其中，麗澤SOHO目前還處於建設中。
2017年，潘石屹曾表示SOHO中國有永遠不能銷售的兩個項目，「外灘SOHO是一個，位置太重要了；望京SOHO不能銷售，太漂亮了，我很喜歡。裡面住得滿滿的，租金水平很高。最高的時候和CBD的水平差不多，這兩個項目在，我就還是一個開發商。」但如今潘石屹有意清倉，將「八大金剛」全部拋出。
《財新網》引述消息人士稱，黑石集團聯合GIC（Government Invested Company）公司成立買方團，有意收購SOHO中國在北京的光華路SOHO、望京SOHO塔3，以及在上海的SOHO復興廣場。目前第一筆交易已接近最後階段。
SOHO中國目前似乎已處於全面撤退狀態。10月29日，SOHO中國發布公告，宣布以7.61億元的價格，出售位於北京建外SOHO東區、三里屯SOHO、SOHO尚都、朝外SOHO等在內的9個商業項目、共計2,583個地下停車位組成的資產包。
10月22日也有消息稱，SOHO中國旗下的共享辦公品牌SOHO3Q下面的11個項目，已經打包出售賣給筑夢之星，目前已經開始進入合同審批流程。這11個項目位於北京和上海，筑夢之星內部員工證實確有此事。
外界都猜測潘石屹是在效仿香港首富李嘉誠，有數據說，自2013年到2018年間，李嘉誠至少出售港幣2,500億元的大陸和香港資產，中共官媒曾高喊「不要讓李嘉誠跑了」。
香港商界曾有個說法，指李嘉誠辦的事，通常超前一年到兩年，比如香港樓市要崩盤，李嘉誠的長和系大舉賣樓通常在半年至一年半前。
大陸網路上曾流傳一個段子，說中國富豪王健林、馬雲、馬化騰和許家印約李嘉誠一起賽跑，中國富豪們都嘲笑李嘉誠年紀大，腿腳不利索，笑他肯定跑不快，結果最後卻是李嘉誠跑了第一。大家都在奇怪為啥他能得第一，李嘉誠大笑說，「誰叫你們聽到槍聲才跑的！」
除了富豪圈，最近，中國民間也開始對李嘉誠拜服稱頌，其中一個原因是他們發現，中國富豪們也開始跑了，而且是集體在跑。近期，中國商界大佬馬雲退休、馬化騰、柳傳志、李彥宏先後卸任跑路。
另外，自7月份以來，A股上市公司有49家董事長辭職。而微信朋友圈瘋傳的一張上市公司董事長離職圖顯示，今年以來中國已有376家上市公司的386位董事長公告離職，也就是說平均一天至少有一位上市公司董事長離職。以中國A股目前上市公司共3,551家計算，大約每9家上市公司就有一位董事長離職。
這些老闆、董事長因何要跑，原因理由可能都不一樣，只能說簡單一點，他們都想學李嘉誠，「跑得快，好世界」。

Pan Shiyi also wants to run ""I don't see things well""? Netizen: Extremely smart

01 Nov 2019, 06:17

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 01, 2019] Pan Shiyi’s news of clearing SOHO China was shocked by the mainland. At present, the current economic situation in China is worrisome, and the real estate market may have a collapse crisis in the future. Some netizens lamented, ""Pan Shizhen is definitely a smart person. Who can run for one second and hope for more survival!""
SOHO China, controlled by Chinese real estate giant Pan Shiyi, plans to sell SOHO China's core assets and eight office buildings for $8 billion, including Beijing's Wangjing SOHO. After the news broke out, it caused public opinion to shake. Someone on the Internet rushed, ""Don’t let Pan Shiyi run!""
The mainland ""Caixin.com"" quoted sources as saying that SOHO China will seek to sell eight major assets in batches and plan to complete all transactions in the next two years. The total value of these eight projects is 50 billion to 60 billion yuan. . Pan Shiyi plans to empty Chinese assets and turn to overseas investment.
According to law analysis, Pan Shiyi is a real estate developer. He wants to sell SOHO and clear the position. It should be said that there is no objection. However, Pan Shiyi’s sale of SOHO seems to be unlucky, and many people suddenly feel like the passengers on the Titanic.
The outside world believes that the current US-China trade war is unresolved, and the current economic situation in China is worrisome. Pan Shiyi’s big sale of this building has released a signal that the mainland real estate market may be in crisis in the future, and the housing market may face a major cooling.
The net name ""Financial Taiji Cat"" posted: ""To tell the truth, Pan Shiyi is definitely a smart person. At this time, the situation is very clear. Even if it is a waist, even 80% of the price will be sold! The future crisis has already been doomed, who can First run for a second and hope for more survival!""
Chen Peter's Coffee House: ""In the 1990s, Pan Shiyi successfully escaped from the Hainan real estate bubble and returned to Beijing to establish SOHO. After more than 20 years, Pan Shiyi sold iron in the shabu-shabu, and a victory escaped. Li Ka-shing, After Pan Shiyi was once a master of escape, they are the core areas of the city. The masters are gone, and the epic real estate rise in China may really end. Don't stand on the top of the mountain, the investment house wants to sell badly. Sell, if you don't, you will get 20% off and 30% off. You must go.""
The luxury seven pairs of ridicule said: ""The choice of the rich is the vane of this society."" Shang Lin’s recluse also ridiculed: “I also strongly bearish and sell all the houses that my family can sell.”
Zhang Ping wrote in the article ""Why did Pan Shiyi want to clear the sale in the next few years?"" ""The real estate tycoon Pan Shiyi sold out the building and bought assets. The main reason is that he is not optimistic about the real estate market and wants to withdraw funds as soon as possible. The bag will be safe. At the same time, it will lower the high debt ratio of its own company to facilitate the transformation of the company.""
""We believe that in the current downturn of the domestic economy, selling assets and choosing cash as the king is necessary for real estate enterprises. Because of the cash to better repay debts, it is possible to acquire other small and medium-sized housing enterprises. It’s going to work. Pan Shiyi’s move is also very wise.”
Today, Liaocheng headlines said: ""After Li Ka-shing sold a lot of Chinese real estate, the real estate giant Pan Shiyi also sold 8 billion US dollars of property, and even sold the core lot of properties, it seems that Lao Pan is very cautious about the future economy!""
According to reports, Pan Shiyi plans to sell the so-called ""Big King Kong"", including Beijing's Wangjing SOHO, Guanghua Road SOHO2, Qianmen Street, Lize SOHO, Shanghai's Bund SOHO, SOHO Fuxing Square, Gubei SOHO and SOHO Tianshan Square project. Among them, Lize SOHO is still under construction.
In 2017, Pan Shiyi once said that SOHO China has two projects that can never be sold. ""The Bund SOHO is one, the location is too important; Wangjing SOHO can't sell, it's so beautiful, I like it very much. The inside is full, the rent level Very high. The highest level is similar to the level of the CBD. I am still a developer when these two projects are in progress.” But now Pan Shiyi intends to clear the position and throw all the “Big King Kong”.
Caixin.com quoted sources as saying that Blackstone Group and GIC (Government Invested Company) formed a buyer group to acquire SOHO China's Guanghua Road SOHO, Wangjing SOHO Tower 3 in Beijing, and SOHO Fuxing Square in Shanghai. The first transaction is currently nearing the final stage.
SOHO China currently seems to be in a full retreat. On October 29, SOHO China announced that it announced the sale of 9 commercial projects in Beijing, Jianwai SOHO East District, Sanlitun SOHO, SOHO Shangdu, Chaowai SOHO, etc. for a total of 2,583 underground parking spaces at a price of 761 million yuan. The asset package consisting of bits.
On October 22, it was also reported that 11 projects under SOHO China's shared office brand SOHO3Q have been packaged for sale and sold to Dream Star, and have now entered the contract approval process. The 11 projects are located in Beijing and Shanghai, and the employees inside the Dream Star confirmed that this was the case.
The outside world has speculated that Pan Shiyi is emulating Li Ka-shing, the richest man in Hong Kong. According to statistics, from 2013 to 2018, Li Ka-shing sold at least HK$250 billion in mainland and Hong Kong assets. The Chinese Communist Party officials shouted ""Don't let Li Ka-shing run.""
There has been a saying in the Hong Kong business community that Li Ka-shing is usually a year or two. For example, the property market in Hong Kong is going to collapse. Li Ka-shing’s long-term sales are usually half a year to a year and a half ago.
On the mainland network, there was a passage saying that Chinese rich Wang Jianlin, Ma Yun, Ma Huateng and Xu Jiayin raced together with Li Ka-shing. The Chinese rich people laughed at Li Ka-shing’s old age and his legs and legs were unfavorable. He laughed that he must not run fast. The result was that Li Ka-shing ran for the first time. One. Everyone is wondering why he can get the first place. Li Ka-shing laughed and said, ""Who told you to hear the gunshots!""
In addition to the rich circle, recently, the Chinese folks began to pay tribute to Li Ka-shing. One of the reasons was that they found that the Chinese rich have also started running, and they are running collectively. Recently, the Chinese business community Ma Yun retired, Ma Huateng, Liu Chuanzhi, and Li Yanhong have stepped down to run.
In addition, since July, 49 A-share listed companies have resigned. The departure chart of a listed company chairman of the WeChat circle of friends shows that 386 directors of 376 listed companies in China have announced their resignation this year, which means that at least one chairman of a listed company has left the company on average one day. Based on a total of 3,551 Chinese A-share listed companies, about one out of every nine listed companies has left.
The reason why these bosses and the chairman of the board are going to run may be different. They can only be said to be simple. They all want to learn Li Ka-shing, ""Run fast, good world.""
