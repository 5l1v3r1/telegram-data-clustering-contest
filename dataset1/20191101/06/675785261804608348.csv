A three-year-old girl has been hospitalised after taking prescription drugs she found in her bucket of Halloween sweets.
Abby Van Der Spuy suddenly became ill while out trick-or-treating with her mum in the suburbs of Melbourne, Australia.
Abby's mum Tara told the Herald Sun she suddenly noticed her daughter was ""zonked and wobbly on her feet"".
It's believed Abby swallowed a drug called Seroquel, which is used to treat depression and bipolar disorder.

According to local media reports, the little girl found the medicine in a zip-locked bag amongst the sweets in her bucket of treats.
Two neighbours quickly called emergency services just after 8pm.
Paramedics rushed to the scene and ""were urgent about getting her to hospital"".
