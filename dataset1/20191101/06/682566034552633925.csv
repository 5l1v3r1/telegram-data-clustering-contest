Paris - Frenchman Gael Monfils moved to within one victory of securing the last spot at the ATP Tour Finals by fighting back from a set and a break down to beat Moldovan Radu Albot in the Paris Masters third round on Thursday.
The 13th seed, who needs to reach the semi-finals at Bercy to snatch the last ATP Finals spot from Italy's Matteo Berrettini, will face Canadian rising star Denis Shapovalov in the last eight on Friday.
