Thousands of people will be able to claim a discount on their energy bill from today, as the Government’s Cold Weather Payments scheme finally opens for winter.
The benefit, designed to support those ‘at risk’, pays £25 a week to vulnerable households who experience periods of especially freezing weather.
This is defined as zero degrees or less for seven or more consecutive days – and is based on official Met Office readings.
The scheme is run by the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) and is available from November 1 until March 31, every year.
The payments will not affect any other state support you receive and will be paid automatically into the same bank or building society account as the one used to pay your benefits, such as universal credit.
Those eligible will usually receive their money within 14 working days.
There are an estimated 3.8million eligible recipients for Cold Weather Payments in the UK, the DWP said.
