Large boxes tied with a shiny ribbon can be an exciting visual, but as many know, the best gifts come in small packages. Sometimes, they come with tiny price tags, too. From a nice wallet to Bluetooth speakers, there are countless presents that can stir a swell of emotion without breaking the bank. 
Need help sourcing these great presents? Here are some of the best gifts for men under $50.

He’s been delighting (and vexing) fans for 80 years. This tie clip may not work on Batman’s utility belt, but a man’s inner Bruce Wayne will surely appreciate it.

“Too much of anything is bad, but too much good whiskey is barely enough,” Mark Twain once quipped. And many men agree with him, including writer Aaron Goldfarb.

Hacking Whiskey offers tips, tricks and recipes for creating the tastiest whiskey-based cocktails.
