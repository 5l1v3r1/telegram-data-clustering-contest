WWE Stock Tumbles Over Q3 Earnings Reports
01 Nov 2019 by David Bixenspan


LAS VEGAS, NV - JANUARY 08: WWE Chairman and CEO Vince McMahon speaks at a news conference ... [+] announcing the WWE Network at the 2014 International CES at the Encore Theater at Wynn Las Vegas on January 8, 2014 in Las Vegas, Nevada. The network will launch on February 24, 2014 as the first-ever 24/7 streaming network, offering both scheduled programs and video on demand. The USD 9.99 per month subscription will include access to all 12 live WWE pay-per-view events each year. CES, the world's largest annual consumer technology trade show, runs through January 10 and is expected to feature 3,200 exhibitors showing off their latest products and services to about 150,000 attendees.

It shouldn’t matter for too long, but Wall Street was not happy with the numbers in World Wrestling Entertainment’s third quarter report for investors. As a result, company stock tumbled 15.65% by the end of the trading day, falling by $10.40, from $66.44 to $56.04. Specifically, WWE changed their profit guidance for the whole of 2019, and that appears to have led to a bit of a sell-off.“The Company has modified its full year 2019 guidance to an Adjusted OIBDA [Operating income before depreciation and amortization)] range of $180 million to $190 million, which would be an all-time record,” reads the report. “The change is attributable to the delay in completing a previously contemplated agreement in the MENA [Middle East and North Afric] region and the impact of accelerated investment to support content creation. While the Company continues to work toward the completion of a MENA agreement, no assurances can be given in this regard. The Company expects to have clarity on this point in advance of providing guidance for 2020.”
“In the quarter, we accelerated strategic investments to support our content creation,” said WWE co-president George Barrios. “Although we have modified our 2019 guidance of Adjusted OIBDA to a range of $180 million to $190 million, performance in this range would still be an all-time record. We continue to believe in WWE’s global growth potential and remain focused on maximizing future opportunities and shareholder value.”
Things will be much different when we get the Q4 and annual reports, though, because the new domestic television deals kicking in for Monday Night Raw (on USA Network), Friday Night SmackDown (on Fox), and NXT (also on USA Network) all got going at the start of October. Raw now brings in $265 million/year ($66.25 million/quarter), while SmackDown is getting WWE $205 million/year ($51.25 million), bringing the company to record revenue and profitability levels.
