天皇努力成為日本的「象徵」，讓皇室成為人民打從心底尊重的新存在
01 Nov 2019, 00:08 by 鄭仲嵐


我們想讓你知道的是經過調查，在過去的戰後昭和時代中，對天皇「沒什麼特別感覺」的反而最多，再來才是「尊敬」、「有好感」。進入平成時代初期後，「有好感」開始慢慢增加，2008年後「尊敬」開始變多，2018年尊敬占比竟達到41％，反而是在愈近幾年時，皇室愈受到尊崇。



德仁正式即位
「帶著國民的寄託，吾將履行並行使日本國及日本國民統合的象徵而努力。」10月22日，日本的今上天皇德仁，在皇居宮殿的正殿「松之間」舉辦「即位禮正殿之儀」，正式宣讀即位致詞。在當天的細雨綿綿中，包括德仁天皇的弟弟秋篠宮文仁親王、與上皇明仁的弟弟常陸宮正仁親王等都列席在位，以文仁親王妃紀子妃為首的9位女性皇族等在一旁依序站齊，迎接最隆重的時刻。
今上天皇德仁雖然在5月時已經即位並更改元號，但對於日本來說，即位大典才是真正代表著向世界宣告新時代建立，並邀請各國嘉賓觀禮。其中英國的查爾斯王子（Charles, Prince of Wales），更是在明仁與德仁即位時都參加，中國則是由國家副主席王岐山代表，並牽線日本首相安倍晉三與中國國家主席習近平能否在2020春天來個「習安會」。美中不足的是，由於先前的哈吉貝颱風災情慘重，原先預計的即位大遊行將延到11月10日再舉辦。
但或許對比上次的即位遊行，德仁的即位也許情勢緩和許多。回顧29年前，1990年11月12日明仁天皇的即位大典，日本全國就出現40起極端份子的游擊隊抗議事件，單是在東京都內就有34起，明顯是衝著當時明仁天皇而來。在即位的大遊行上，也有14發迫擊砲彈朝皇居發射，但都被攔了下來。當年激進主義份子高舉「天皇即位儀式粉碎」大旗，19天內發動超過70起游擊事件，對於皇室的反對，當時很多人是很敏感的。
皇族繼承將變？
在進入令和時代後，許多人在議論的，也是將來「後令和時期」皇族該如何變化，將來的繼位問題等都被媒體拿出來討論。根據現今的《皇室典範》，皇位繼承的優先順序為德仁天皇的弟弟文仁親王、再來是文仁唯一的兒子悠仁親王、最後才是上皇明仁的弟弟正仁親王。但正仁親王已高齡83歲，就現實點考量而言，秋篠宮家的文仁親王父子，是唯二有資格繼承皇位的人選。
因此，就未來來看，秋篠宮家族是需要被保護的皇室命脈。在今（2019）年8月，文仁親王訪問不丹王國時，文仁親王雖然是一家造訪，但必須分乘兩架飛機，間隔約半小時，先是悠仁親王與母親紀子妃、再來是文仁親王降落後，三人才可以一起行動。這也是因為兩人分別是繼承順位第一與第二位，基於風險考量下的決定，回國時一家也是分乘兩架回日本，這樣的情形在往後只會愈來愈多。
再者，皇室成員的高齡化也是重要問題，目前皇室家族18人中，包含上皇與上皇后在內共有七人超過60歲。30歲以下的皇室成員，扣掉悠仁親王後還有6位皇室未婚女性，一旦結婚後勢必會脫離皇籍成為平民。將來如果等到悠仁繼位，很可能身邊的姊姊們都已不再是皇族，如果悠仁結婚後誕下男兒，那皇室命脈尚能延續。在當今皇室也「少子化」的危機中，悠仁在20歲成年後的成家與女性繼位問題，未來將持續熱議。

天皇政治影響
除此之外，天皇在日本的政治上雖然沒有實權，但是對於民間社會的影響力還是相當巨大。因此，天皇是否可能在未來被「政治利用」，也成為日媒關注的焦點。特別是去（2018）年5月，美國總統川普（Donald Trump）以「令和首位國賓」之姿來到東京，並會見德仁天皇夫婦。當時美日陷入關稅交涉上的泥淖，安倍晉三以「200年來首次的退位」來應邀川普，川普也以「不輸美式足球超級盃」來回應，促成了川普順利訪日。
不過隨後，包括偏左派的《朝日新聞》與左派的《東京新聞》等，都發報導批評這樣有讓天皇「被政治利用的疑慮」。因為根據日本1951年修訂的《憲法》，天皇只能履行「法定國事行為」，雖然政府隨後表示「不含任何政治意味與政治影響」，但內閣是否可以以在法律的空間上跟皇室取得一個明確範疇，一直以來也被很多媒體爭論。2009年時，明仁天皇破格接見當時還是國家副主席的習近平時，也遭批評「政治利用」。
這讓人回想起1992年10月，明仁天皇訪問中國的回憶。當時明仁身為首位訪中的天皇，引起日本朝野很多正反聲浪。除了中國潛藏的安全因素外，再來就是擔憂中方「政治利用」。
先前因為天安門事件，讓中國改革開放的前景矇上很大的國際形象損毀，後來明仁天皇受到當時國家主席江澤民為首隆重接待，但後來前國務院副總理錢其琛也在回憶錄說「明仁天皇訪中，確實是天安門事件後中國對西方世界的突破口」，顯見政治利用上還是有其效用。未來的時代，天皇的象徵意義是否會成為日本政治人物的籌碼，恐怕是另一個重大議題。
從動盪到平穩
當年明仁天皇即位時，世界局勢相當不穩。即位的3個月前，伊拉克攻打科威特，揭開了波灣戰爭的序幕。即位當時，全世界正聚焦美國與多國部隊的「沙漠風暴行動」，或許讓明仁即位受注目度較低。但29年過去後，世界局勢依然是相當詭譎，資訊戰、恐怖主義、天災頻仍、兩極化的獨裁崛起，都是新世代的課題。日本也在天災、特別是颱風與地震上不斷受害，天皇夫婦現身穩定災民的意義更為重大。
一件特別的事是，根據《朝日新聞》報導，日本NHK從1973年起，每隔五年會對日本民眾做一次「日本人意識調查」。其中在過去的戰後昭和時代中，對天皇「沒什麼特別感覺」的反而最多，再來才是「尊敬」、「有好感」。進入平成時代初期後，「有好感」開始慢慢增加，2008年後「尊敬」開始變多，2018年尊敬占比竟達到41％，不算二戰前的歷史，反而是在愈近幾年時，皇室愈受到尊崇。
日本作家赤坂真理，曾出版《箱子中的天皇》一書，她說，如果象徵是一個空箱子，那重點就是，空箱子裡要裝什麼？過去的二次大戰期間，裝的是軍國的至高無上象徵，在戰後時期，逐漸演變成祈願和平的象徵。那在新的時代開始後，令和除了持續訴諸和平理念外，可能更會加強安撫人心的象徵。在近幾十年的潛移默化中，明仁天皇已經塑造其獨有的象徵，讓皇室成為人民打從心底尊重的新存在。
當然，還有很多未來天皇的象徵意義是可以被討論的，什麼樣的天皇象徵能夠更連結當今社會，演變成為新的道統，在即位大典後，對全日本國民來說，不妨是個大家一起思考的新契機。「天皇」在日本現代所賦予的象徵意義，雖然有許多考驗，但終究會隨著時間，找出最佳解答。

The Emperor strives to become the ""symbol"" of Japan, and let the royal family become a new existence that the people respect from the bottom of their hearts.
01 Nov 2019, 00:08 by Zheng Zhongkai


What we want you to know is that after investigation, in the past post-war Showa era, the Emperor had ""there was no particular feeling"" but the most was ""respect"" and ""good feeling"". After entering the early period of the Heisei era, the ""good feelings"" began to increase gradually. After 2008, ""respect"" began to increase. In 2018, the proportion of respect was as high as 41%. On the contrary, the more the royal family became more respected.



Deren officially took the throne
""With the national sustenance, I will work hard to fulfill and exercise the symbol of the integration of the Japanese and Japanese nationals."" On October 22nd, the Japanese Emperor Deren of Japan held the ""Right"" in the main hall of the Imperial Palace. The instrument of the ceremony is officially read out. In the drizzle of the day, including the brother of Deren Emperor’s younger brother Qiu Jingong, and the brother of Emperor Mingren’s younger brother, Mr. Chang Lugong, are present in the position, and the nine female royal families headed by Prince Wen’s prince, Ji Zizi, are standing in the same place. Qi, greet the most solemn moment.
Although Emperor Deren of the present day has already taken the position and changed the yuan in May, for Japan, the impromptu ceremony is truly representative of the establishment of a new era to the world, and invites guests from all over the world to pay tribute. Among them, Prince Charles of the United Kingdom participated in the case of Akihito and Deren, while China was represented by Vice President Wang Qishan and related to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping. In the spring of 2020, I will come to the ""Xi'an Society."" The fly in the ointment is that due to the typhoon disaster in the previous Haji Bay, the original expected parade will be postponed until November 10.
But perhaps compared to the last parade of the throne, Deren’s ascension may have eased the situation a lot. Looking back 29 years ago, on November 12, 1990, Emperor Akihito’s assassination ceremony, there were 40 extremist guerrilla protests across Japan, 34 in Tokyo alone, apparently at the time of Emperor Akihito. Come. In the parade of the throne, 14 mortar shells were fired at the Imperial Palace, but they were all stopped. In the past, radical activists held high the banner of ""The Emperor's Ascension Ceremony"" and launched more than 70 guerrilla incidents in 19 days. Many people were very sensitive to the opposition of the royal family.
Will royal inheritance change?
After the entry order and the times, many people are talking about how the royal family will change in the future, and the future succession issues will be discussed by the media. According to the current ""Royal Model"", the priority order of the succession of the throne is the prince Wenren of Emperor Deren, the only son of Wenren, who is the only son of Wenren, and finally the brother of Emperor Zhongren of Emperor Mingren. However, the Prince of Zhengren is 83 years old. In terms of practical considerations, the Prince of Wenren, the father of the Qiuyi Palace, is the only person who is qualified to inherit the throne.
Therefore, in the future, the Qiuqionggong family is the royal lifeline that needs to be protected. In August (2019), when Prince Wenren visited the Kingdom of Bhutan, although Prince Wenren was a visitor, he had to take two planes, about half an hour apart. First, Prince Yuren and his mother, Ji Zi, and Wen Ren. After the prince falls, the three talents can act together. This is also because the two are inherited the first and second place respectively. Based on the decision under risk considerations, when returning to China, the family also took two trips back to Japan. This situation will only increase in the future.
Moreover, the aging of the royal family members is also an important issue. At present, among the 18 members of the royal family, seven people including the Upper Emperor and the Upper Queen are over 60 years old. The royal family members under the age of 30, after deducting the Prince of Youren, there are also six unmarried women in the royal family. Once married, they are bound to leave the royal family and become civilians. In the future, if we wait for Yuren to succeed, it is very likely that the people around us are no longer royals. If Yuren married and gave birth to a man, the royal lifeline can continue. In today's crisis of the royal family's ""small child"", Yuren's succession in the 20th year of adulthood and female succession will continue to be discussed in the future.

Emperor political influence
In addition, although the Emperor has no real power in Japan's politics, the influence on civil society is still quite large. Therefore, whether the Emperor may be ""politically utilized"" in the future has also become the focus of Japanese media attention. In particular, in May (2018), US President Donald Trump came to Tokyo with the title of ""Order and the first national guest"" and met with the Emperor Deren. At that time, the United States and Japan fell into the mud on the tariff negotiations. Abe was invited to Trump by ""the first abdication in 200 years"", and Trump responded with ""not losing the American Football Super Cup"", which led to Trump's smooth visit to Japan.
However, afterwards, the ""Asahi Shimbun"", including the leftist, and the ""Tokyo News"" of the left, all reported criticisms of the doubts that made the emperor ""politically exploited."" Because according to the Constitution amended by Japan in 1951, the Emperor can only perform ""statutory state affairs"". Although the government subsequently stated that it ""does not contain any political meaning and political influence"", can the cabinet obtain a space with the royal family in the legal space? Clearly defined, it has been debated by many media. In 2009, Emperor Akihito was criticized for ""political use"" when he met with Xi Jinping, then the vice president of the country.
This is reminiscent of the memories of Emperor Akihito's visit to China in October 1992. At that time, Ming Ren was the first emperor to visit China, causing many positive and negative voices in the Japanese ruling and opposition. In addition to China's hidden security factors, it is worrying about China's ""political use.""
Previously, due to the Tiananmen incident, the prospect of China's reform and opening up was tarnished by a great international image. Later, Emperor Akihito was first received by President Jiang Zemin at the time. However, former Vice Premier Qian Qichen also wrote in his memoirs, ""Mr. It is indeed a breakthrough for China in the Western world after the Tiananmen incident. It is obvious that political use still has its effect. In the future, whether the symbolic meaning of the Emperor will become a bargaining chip for Japanese politicians is probably another major issue.
From turmoil to smooth
When Emperor Akihito took the throne, the world situation was quite unstable. Three months before the throne, Iraq attacked Kuwait and opened the prelude to the Gulf War. At the time of the throne, the world was focusing on the ""Desert Storm Operation"" of the United States and the multinational force, which may have made Aomori less noticeable. However, after 29 years, the world situation is still quite embarrassing. Information warfare, terrorism, frequent natural disasters, and the rise of polarized dictatorships are all issues of the new generation. Japan is also suffering from natural disasters, especially typhoons and earthquakes. The significance of the emperor’s presence in stabilizing the victims is even more significant.
A special thing is that according to the Asahi Shimbun, NHK Japan has conducted a ""Japanese Consciousness Survey"" for Japanese people every five years since 1973. Among them, in the past post-war Showa era, the Emperor had ""there was no particular feeling"" but the most was ""respect"" and ""good feeling"". After entering the early period of the Heisei era, the ""good feelings"" began to increase gradually. After 2008, ""respect"" began to increase. In 2018, the proportion of respect was as high as 41%. It is not the history before World War II, but the more recent years. The royal family is more respected.
The Japanese writer Akasaka, who published the book The Emperor in the Box, said that if the symbol is an empty box, the point is, what should be installed in the empty box? During the Second World War, it was the supreme symbol of the military state. In the post-war period, it gradually evolved into a symbol of peace. After the beginning of the new era, and in addition to continuing to resort to the concept of peace, it may strengthen the symbol of appeasement. In the subtle decades of subtlety, Emperor Akihito has shaped its unique symbol, making the royal family a new existence that the people respect from the bottom of their hearts.
Of course, there are still many symbolic meanings of the future emperor that can be discussed. What kind of emperor symbol can be more connected to today's society and evolve into a new Taoist system. After the impromptu grand ceremony, for all Japanese nationals, it may be a matter for everyone to think together. New opportunity. The symbolism of the ""Emperor"" in modern Japan, although there are many tests, will eventually find the best answer with time.
