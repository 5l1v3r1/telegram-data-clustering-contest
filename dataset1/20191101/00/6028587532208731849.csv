The business of porn is continuously expanding. While there will always be free porn at sites like YouPorn and Pornhub, with the proliferation of social media, paying for porn is chic again. Performers are just as chic, and want to connect to their audience in a more personal way while stick maximizing their profits along the way. One of the latest options to take advantage of this business model is APClips (NSFW), a pay-for-porn site designed by content creators for content creators. With over 3k performers/content creators, 70k videos for sale and over 100k registered and active fans, APClips is building a foundation for a solid porn enterprise. Built on a token-based platform, APClips is offering more on the back-end to performers, while still being able to cover its overhead and build its platform. One of the stand out differences between APClips and other clip sites is the site was built and is run by adult industry veterans and content creators. This helps create a solid community that puts its models and performers first.
Based on all the porn stars I follow on Twitter it is apparent that OnlyFans is one of the most popular pay-for-porn-content sites out there. After all, it did have a hand in revolutionizing the power dynamic for sex workers and porn entertainers, but is certainly not the only platform in existence. Naturally, from the perspective of a porn performer it's probably daunting to pick the right platform, or manage multiple ones. But the options exist and that's a good thing.
The point is, since OnlyFans skyrocketed in popularity, the market has expanded for fan-direct adult sites. Sites like IsMyGirl cater to the softcore, classy crowd while APClips is taking a more hard-edged approach. APClips is definitely more edgy, more porny, and more cult-ish with the kinds of performers on the site. It's like the indie version of Onlyfans and ManyVids. If Suicide Girls actually were porn performers, it would be this.
There is more space for more specialized versions of these sites to exist in the current social atmosphere than ever before giving adult performers and fans a wider variety of choice, as well as the option to spread their dollars across numerous platforms.
For a lot of performers, a platform like APClips offers them a freedom in building their fan base they had previously not experienced. In some cases, APClips specifically presents a nature of inclusivity not found on some other clip sites.
""I've only had positive interactions with the audience there [at APClips],"" says Boring Kate, content creator and APClips Brand Ambassador. ""It's really where I first managed to actually find meaningful success doing porn. Like it's what turned porn from a hobby to a career for me. It's wild. I'm a chubby nerdy trans girl that only does solo scenes and I've ended up being the third highest seller of all time on the whole site.""
It's that selling independence that has helped to create a new atmosphere of porn. No longer are porn performers directly subjected to exploitation, they are in control of their own financial destiny. The more work they put in, cultivating their social media engagement and growth, interacting with fans, the more they are rewarded financially. This is the freedom of expression and self we all fight for, and sex workers deserve every opportunity to succeed as any other chosen career.
""Before joining the industry, I was a very shy girl who worked in a salon, making minimum wage part time. I wanted a way to express myself and my sexuality and hopefully build my confidence and I needed a second job so I was drawn to camming and from there started making my own videos,"" says Selina Kyl. ""Regardless of the platform, work doesn't end with uploading a video. You have to get out there and build your own audience through social media. It's a lot of work so I need to feel supported which is why APClips is my favorite platform to work on. Because of their high payouts I feel like I'm able to reap more of what I sow when monetizing my audience. I feel like both my work and I are appreciated.""
Look, it's tough sometimes to write something about these sites that is any different from the last time. APClips on the base level, is a porn clips site so there shouldn't be too much you don't already know just from knowing that much. But just like driving in rush hour in Florida, there is always something that might surprise you. For APClips, it is the personal touch. It's the constant communication and support from the APClips team to the performers who have chosen an oftentimes stressful and harassment-filled career.
""I've been ashamed at points to promote my work on other platforms because of shady behavior or otherwise inappropriate and unacceptable things happening,"" laments Kit Kendal. ""Letting totally unacceptable behavior and content go unpunished while punishing smaller creators for doing nothing wrong, double standards, playing favorites and not applying the same rules and standards to everyone, the list goes on. It made it harder and harder for me to even want to have my content up and sold on other sites. It felt dirty, in a wrong way. I hated supporting the things these other sites were allowing and doing by bringing my traffic and sales there. I finally had enough and took a huge leap of faith and swapped 100+ clips and photosets over to APClips this year and I'm so happy I did. I can’t stress this enough; I’ve had just about more success in my content career since than, then I have in 2-3 years elsewhere.""
As I peruse through this industry, there are important factors that stand out when choosing to write about or even tweet about certain porn sites. Inclusiveness is important. Treating performers like humans is important. Giving performers the opportunities they deserve is important, and having a clean, easily navigable platform is important. This might not entirely set APCLips apart from the rest, but what it does is offer a new alternative that took all these things into account before publishing the damn index page.
From that standpoint, APClips is a shining example of how a porn clips site should be set up. It should put more control over the freedom of sale to the performers. It should provide a safe and harassment free environment for them, as well as giving users a clean interface and simple transactional actions. With its tip-to-vote photo contests, top-sellers contests and Twitter hashtag photo contests, APClips further gives performers and fans more ways to engage and build audiences and by proxy, financial gains.
We (as a society) have this undeserved bias towards sex workers that just shouldn't exist. Porn performers don't deserve the shame placed upon them by a society afraid to embrace its own sexuality. Every time another one of these platforms pop into existence and performers start making money, it's another step toward total acceptance. Someone is paying for these clips, and as these platforms and personal audiences grow, so shall its acceptance in the mainstream. At least, that's the hope.
