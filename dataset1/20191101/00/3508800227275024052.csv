台灣影史上第一部科幻長篇動畫電影《重甲機神Baryon．神降臨》，今（2019）年11月8日，將在全國院線上映。這部電影跟台灣的物理界有莫大關係──它的原始構想，誕生於2007年在中央大學舉行的物理學會年會，由兩個不太專心的物理學家想出來的故事。一個是東海大學應用物理的施奇廷教授（也就是筆者），另一個是中原大學物理系的許經夌教授。

那一年，我有幸得到國家理論科學中心的「年輕理論學者獎」，在這一次的物理年會中受獎，緊接著頒完獎的下一個場次就是「大型研究計畫論壇」。由於不好意思領完獎就溜掉，所以就留下來聽講，這個論壇的內容包括「奈米國家型計畫」、「中子束實驗站」、同步輻射中心」、「高磁場人才培育計畫」、「國家理論科學中心」。
既然是大型研究計畫，當然會講到已經、或者將要建置大型儀器，洋洋灑灑如「中子源」、「先進光源」、「超導磁鐵」、「高功率雷射」、「高解析度X光繞射儀」等等，聽起來都很威的儀器。
這時候不知道是誰起的頭，開始了這樣的討論：「欸，你不覺得這些東西聽起來挺厲害的，有一種超級機器人武器裝備的FU嗎？」「對耶，乾脆把把這些東西組裝起來，變成一台擁有各種把先進物理儀器改裝成超級武器的巨大機器人好了……」就這樣，台上的師長們講的內容被置之腦後，兩個阿宅老師在台下討論起要怎麼把這部作品架構起來。然後「重甲機神Baryon」故事的基本架構就這樣出來了，寫物理論文絕對沒這麼快。
追著科幻夢的少年到物理學家
當然啦，「正常的」物理學家，大概不會在這種場合下去討論這種事。不過如果探究是什麼原因能吸引世界各國的年輕人，投入科學研究行列的話，「小時候看過的科幻作品所帶來的夢想與憧憬」絕對佔有很重要的一席之地。
美國人從小看《星際大戰》（Star Wars）、《星際爭霸戰》（Star Trek）這類科幻作品，讓許多人從小懷抱著太空夢，長大也因此成為太空人或是太空科學家。日本則是在第二次世界大戰後成為動漫畫文化大國，特別是機器人動畫是撐起整個產業的重要支柱。不少目前4、50歲的日本人，都是從小看《無敵鐵金剛》跟《鋼彈》長大的，這些人之中，有不少日後也成為日本機器人工學的中堅分子。


畫出像小時候看的《無敵鐵金剛》般帥氣的超級機器人，是製作團隊一致的夢想。圖片來源：《重甲機神Baryon．神降臨》

台灣的情形又是如何呢？1970年代後期的台灣，電視台引進了《科學小飛俠》、《無敵鐵金剛》、《宇宙戰艦》、《太空突擊隊》這些作品，每天6點在電視上播映，風靡了台灣的小學生。同時期科幻鉅作《星際大戰》，以及《海底城》、《太空城》兩部科幻味十足的007電影接連上映，更讓當時的台灣小朋友成了充滿了對科學的夢想。
當時還是小學生的我們（附帶一提，也是小學同學），就是當年這一群「科學少年」其中的兩個。《科學小飛俠II》中的大反派「辛格萊爵士」是「加州柏克萊大學物理博士，第一名畢業的天才」，他的工作是「每天製造機械鐵獸以征服世界」，我們一看大為震驚：「物理真是太厲害了！念了物理就可以製造鐵獸來征服世界。」於是暗暗立下以後也要念到物理博士的決心。然後真的做到了。
當然，不用念到博士，就知道其實念物理並不能製造鐵獸征服世界，不過我們還是繼續把學位念完了，因為物理真的很有趣。不過大家也都知道，物理還真不好念，但是從小看科學小飛俠、星際大戰，高中看《超時空要塞》跟艾西莫夫的《基地三部曲》（那時候叫做《銀河帝國的興亡》），大學看《鋼彈》與《阿基拉》……科幻作品帶來的夢想與對未來的期待，支撐著我們的物理之路。
大學裡不一樣的科學課
之後進入大學開始教書，倒不是對教學特別有興趣，而是比較像「物理這麼有趣的東西，不能只有我知道！」這種想法。不過很遺憾的，學生之中領情的不多。這時候看到柳田理科雄的《空想科學讀本》與任教於明尼蘇達大學物理系的James Kakalios教授的《The Physics of Superheroes》，覺得「這個有搞頭！」於是我跟許老師一起開發了「空想不科學、科學要空想」的系列演講，以物理學的定量精神，探討動漫畫、電影裡面的情節，是否合乎物理學。
由於兩位老師「宅力」十足，知名的動漫電影場景加上物理專業知識，可說是知識性與娛樂性兼具，所以這個系列的演講還滿受歡迎的。演講後經常聽見的一句話是：「如果當年學校的物理課也是這樣的話，我說不定就會唸物理了。」因此我們真的把這些內容變成「學校裡的物理課」，將它繼續「增殖」成東海大學的「電影中的物理學探究」以及中原大學的「超級英雄的物理學」這兩門通識課。
隨著這個系列演講與課程的擴大，我們也遭遇到一些問題，其中最重要的就是「著作權」，這樣的內容要成立，演講中或是課堂上播放影片片段是必要的。當然這還在「非營利、學術用、長度短」的「合理引用」的範圍之內，不過如果要變成「磨課師」線上課程，或是要出書就麻煩了。於是興起了「要喝牛奶，就自己養條牛吧！」也就是「自己的梗自己生」，拍一部我們自己的科幻動畫電影好了。
「拍部自己的動畫電影」雖然比「製造機械鐵獸來征服世界」容易一點，不過對兩個物理學家來說，也是有如天方夜譚一樣的夢想。不過這裡出現了一個讓夢想成為現實的男人，就是《重甲機神Baryon》的老闆兼導演、人稱Jo-Jo的黃瀛洲老師，他的行動力，是這個企劃案歷經漫長的12年終於能夠完成的最大推力。
我們3個在20年前成立了「傻呼嚕同盟」這個動漫畫與次文化評論組織，寫了不少動漫畫評論書，像是《動漫2000》、《動漫2001》、《日本動畫五天王》，都成為現在日本動漫畫研究碩、博士論文必備的參考文獻。我們2011年在東海大學開了「御宅學」課程，連日本的全國性大報《產經新聞》都來採訪報導，連日本台灣交流協會（實際上就是日本大使館）都派文化室主任來旁聽了3節課。
「Brayon」
回到12年前的物理年會現場，當天晚上我們立刻開始討論將「台灣物理學家用研究儀器，組裝成巨大機器人抵抗來路不明的侵略者」故事化的可行性，結果立刻被Jo-Jo打臉：「壞人要征服世界從紐約開始打，有超人蝙蝠俠鋼鐵人出來抵抗，這很合理；從東京開始打，有無敵鐵金剛頂著，也有說服力。跑來打台灣？觀眾只會認為外星人迷路了吧！」真是尖銳的指責。
傷了一陣腦筋之後，居然也解決了這個問題：侵略者發動奇襲，第一擊就把世界上各大強國全打爆，台灣是殘存國家中的最強者！所以故事就可以名正言順的從台灣開始了，真是有夠硬凹的劇情。
解決了最初的難題之後，就開始細部的設定。首先，是機器人的名字，為什麼叫「Baryon」、「重子」呢？這部機器人不只是由科學儀器組裝而成，而且還是由3個主角分別駕駛3部小機器人，可以變形合體，這是「巨大機器人阿宅的浪漫」。如果這些阿宅還是物理學家的話，「三機合體」首先想到的當然就是「3個夸克組成的重子」了。
3部小機器人分別被命名為「Truth Quark」（Top Quark 的舊稱）、「Charm Quark」、「Strange Quark」，分別由男女主角以及第二男主角駕駛，所以從片名開始，就是滿滿的物理梗了。不過後來因為「儀器拼裝」跟「三機合體」實在太難畫了，所以只好忍痛放棄兩個設定，只留下了「Baryon」這個名字，我的物理魂跟御宅魂同時在哭泣……
既然我們的目的是利用科幻娛樂作品來吸引更多人認識科學的有趣之處，作品裡面當然得要有許多科學的成分，但是又不能多到讓敘事變得拖泥帶水，變成「教學影片」，那就失去原來的意義了。因此我們雖然放了不少的科學設定在裡面，但是並不會有太多說明，以免影響電影的趣味性。科學的部分我們將會進行巡迴講座、系列科普文，以及製作短片來做更深入的探討，敬請期待。

The world's first animated film born from the physical annual meeting: ""Heavy armor god Baryon. God is coming
01 Nov 2019, 00:07 by Physics Bimonthly PSROC


What we want you to know is the first sci-fi long animated film in Taiwan’s film history, ""Heavy Armor Baryon."" The Advent of God will be screened online on November 8th. The original idea of the film was born in 2007 at the Central University of Physics Annual Meeting, a story that was unimagined by two less-focused physicists.



Text: Shi Qiting
The first sci-fi long animated film in the history of Taiwanese film ""Heavy armor God Baryon. God's Advent, today (November 8th, 2019), will be screened in the National Academy. The film has a lot to do with Taiwan's physics community - its original vision, born in 2007 at the Central University of the physics society annual meeting, was written by two less focused physicists. One is Professor Shi Qiting (also the author) of Applied Physics at Tokai University, and the other is Professor Xu Jingwei from the Physics Department of Chung Yuan University.


The mad scientist Si Kongxian in the play is the spokesperson of the two creative teachers. Image source: ""Heavy armor god Baryon. God is coming

That year, I was fortunate to receive the ""Young Theory Scholar Award"" from the National Center for Theoretical Science, and I won the award at this physics conference. The next session of the award was the ""Large Research Project Forum."" I was embarrassed to slip away when I finished the award, so I stayed to listen. The contents of this forum include ""National National Project"", ""Neutral Beam Experimental Station"", Synchrotron Radiation Center, and ""High Magnetic Field Talent Cultivation Program"". ""National Center for Theoretical Science.""
Since it is a large-scale research project, of course, it will be said that large instruments have been or will be built, such as ""neutron source"", ""advanced light source"", ""superconducting magnet"", ""high power laser"", ""high resolution"". X-ray diffractometers, etc., sounds great instruments.
At this time, I don’t know who started it. I started this discussion: ""Hey, don’t you think these things sound very powerful. Is there a FU for super robotic weapons?"" ""Yes, just put these things."" Assembled into a huge robot with all kinds of advanced physical instruments converted into super weapons..."" In this way, the contents of the teachers on the stage were left behind, and the two Azhai teachers discussed in the audience. How do you structure this work? Then the basic structure of the story of ""The Baryon"" is like this. It is definitely not so fast to write physics papers.
A teenager chasing a science fiction dream to a physicist
Of course, ""normal"" physicists probably won't discuss this kind of thing on this occasion. However, if the reason is to attract young people from all over the world and invest in the ranks of scientific research, ""the dreams and embarrassment brought about by the science fiction works that I have seen as a child"" definitely occupy a very important place.
Americans have seen sci-fi works such as Star Wars and Star Trek from a young age, and many people have embraced space dreams from a young age and grew up to become astronauts or space scientists. Japan became a big country in the animation and culture after the Second World War. In particular, robot animation is an important pillar for supporting the entire industry. Many Japanese people, aged 4 or 50, grew up watching ""Invincible Iron King Kong"" and ""Steel Bomb"" from a young age. Many of these people have become the backbone of Japanese robotics in the future.


It is a dream of the production team to draw a super robot like the ""Invincible Iron King"" that I saw when I was a child. Image source: ""Heavy armor god Baryon. God is coming

What is the situation in Taiwan? In Taiwan in the late 1970s, TV stations introduced the works ""Science Peter Pan"", ""Invincible Iron King Kong"", ""Space Battleship"", and ""Space Commando"". They were broadcast on TV at 6 o'clock every day, and they were popular among Taiwanese primary school students. At the same time, the sci-fi masterpiece ""Star Wars"", as well as ""Underwater City"" and ""Space City"" two sci-fi 007 films were released one after another, which made the Taiwanese children at that time full of dreams of science.
At that time, we were still primary school students (with a mention of the primary school students), which was two of the ""scientific teenagers"" of the year. The big villain in Science Pantheon II is ""The Doctor of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley, the first genius to graduate."" His job is to ""manufacture mechanical iron beasts every day to conquer the world."" We were shocked at first sight: ""Physics is really amazing! After reading physics, you can make iron beasts to conquer the world."" So I will read the physics doctor's determination after secretly setting up. Then it really did.
Of course, you don't have to think about a doctor, you know that physics can't make iron beasts to conquer the world, but we still finish the degree, because physics is really interesting. But everyone knows that physics is really bad, but from a young age, Science Peter Pan, Star Wars, High School, ""The Macross"" and Asimov's ""Base Trilogy"" (that was called ""The Milky Way Empire"" The rise and fall of the school), the university sees ""Steel Bomb"" and ""Akira""... The dreams brought by science fiction and the expectation of the future support our physical path.
Different science classes in the university
After entering the university to start teaching, it is not particularly interesting for teaching, but rather the idea of ""physical so interesting things, not only I know!"" But unfortunately, there are not many students who are in love. At this time, I saw Liu Tianke's ""Utopia Science Reader"" and ""The Physics of Superheroes"" taught by Professor James Kakalios of the Department of Physics of the University of Minnesota. I felt that ""this is a head start!"" So I developed a fantasy with Xu. A series of speeches that are unscientific and scientific, and use the quantitative spirit of physics to explore whether the plots in comics and movies are physics.
Because the two teachers are full of ""home power"", well-known anime film scenes plus physics expertise, can be said to be both intellectual and entertaining, so this series of speeches is still very popular. One of the words I often heard after the speech was: ""If the physics class of the school was like this, I might read physics."" So we really turned this into a ""physics class in school"" and continued it. ""Proliferation"" is a general course of ""Physical Exploration in Films"" at Tokai University and ""Physics of Superheroes"" at Chung Yuan University.
With the expansion of this series of lectures and courses, we have also encountered some problems, the most important of which is ""copyright"". It is necessary to set up such content, and to play video clips in lectures or in class. Of course, this is still within the scope of ""reasonable citation"" for ""non-profit, academic use, and short length"". However, if you want to become a ""Mr. Master"" online course, you will have trouble publishing a book. So I raised up, ""I want to drink milk, I will raise a cow myself!"" That is, ""Own stalks are born,"" and take a picture of our own science fiction animated film.
""It’s easier to shoot your own animated film than to make a mechanical iron beast to conquer the world."" But for two physicists, it is also like a fantasy. However, there is a man who makes dreams come true. It is the boss and director of ""Heaven Machine Baryon"" and the teacher of Jo-Jo, who is called Jo-Jo. His action is that this project can finally be completed after 12 years. The maximum thrust.
Three of us established the ""Stupid League"" comic book and subculture commentary organization 20 years ago, and wrote a lot of comic reviews, such as ""Anime 2000"", ""Anime 2001"", ""Japanese Animation Five-Day King"" They have become the necessary reference documents for the research and doctoral thesis of Japanese comic book. In 2011, we opened the ""Otaku School"" course at Tokai University. Even Japan's national newspaper ""Sankei Shimbun"" came to interview and even the Japan Taiwan Exchange Association (actually the Japanese Embassy) sent the director of the Culture Office. I have been listening to 3 lessons.
""Brayon""
Going back to the physical annual meeting 12 years ago, we immediately began to discuss the feasibility of ""Taiwan physicists using research instruments and assembling them into giant robots to resist invaders from unknown sources."" The result was immediately Jo-Jo. Face-to-face: ""The bad guys want to conquer the world from New York. There is Superman Batman Iron Man coming out to resist. This is very reasonable. Starting from Tokyo, there is invincible Iron King, and it is convincing. Run to play Taiwan? The audience will only I think the aliens are lost!"" It is a sharp accusation.
After hurting a brainstorm, it actually solved this problem: the aggressors launched a surprise attack, and the first strike destroyed all the great powers in the world. Taiwan is the strongest among the surviving countries! Therefore, the story can be justified from Taiwan. It is really a rigid plot.
After solving the initial problem, start the detailed settings. First of all, it is the name of the robot. Why is it called ""Baryon"" or ""Heavy""? This robot is not only assembled by scientific instruments, but also drives three small robots from three main characters, which can be deformed and combined. This is the ""romanticity of a huge robot house."" If these amenities are still physicists, the first thing that comes to mind in the ""three-machine combination"" is of course ""the three heavyweights of quarks.""
The three small robots were named ""Truth Quark"" (the old name of Top Quark), ""Charm Quark"" and ""Strange Quark"". They were driven by the male and female protagonists and the second male lead, so they started from the title. The physical stem. However, because ""instrument assembly"" and ""three-machine fit"" were too difficult to draw, I had to give up two settings, leaving only the name ""Baryon"". My physical soul and the otaku soul are crying at the same time...
Since our aim is to use science fiction entertainment to attract more people to understand the interesting aspects of science, there must be many scientific elements in the works, but not so much that the narrative becomes a ""teaching film"". It loses its original meaning. Therefore, although we have put a lot of scientific settings in it, there is not much explanation, so as not to affect the fun of the film. In the scientific part, we will conduct roving lectures, series of popular sciences, and make short films for further discussion. Stay tuned.
