Hey everyone! It's Friday, so you know what that means! Time to check in with the OCR community to see what's going on!
First, we have Shauntele, who is wrapping up a fabulous OCR season with multiple Trifecta medals! We can't wait to see what next season brings.



Next, we have Korey, whose Instagram tagline is “Do what makes you happy.” What makes Corey happy this week is seeing gains, both on and off the course. Keep at it!



Where are your weekend plans? Let us know in the comments!
