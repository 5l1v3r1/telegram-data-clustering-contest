2020 Audi A1 review | Small car review
01 Nov 2019 by Trent Nikolic



While our launch drive was brief, jumping between variants in between shooting video, we learnt pretty quickly that the new 2020 Audi A1 is an impressive premium compact hatch. Styling is subjective, but I think it looks the part – certainly for the intended buyer.
The quality of the fit and finish, and the quality of the drive experience across the three variants we tested, is also right up where it needs to be. I think Audi is onto a winner, and I think if the A1 floats your boat, there’s an option that will fit within your budget.
It might not get Aussies rushing out of compact SUVs and back to compact hatches, but it’s a significant step forward from the model it replaces.
