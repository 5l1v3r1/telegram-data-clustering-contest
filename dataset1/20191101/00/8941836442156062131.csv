Beto O’Rourke’s dashed White House dreams trolled by NRA:
01 Nov 2019 by Douglas Ernst
The National Rifle Association wasted no time on Friday trolling Beto O’Rourke’s failed presidential dreams by referencing his “Hell yes!” response on the idea of AR-15 confiscations.
“Beto O’Rourke has dropped out of the 2020 presidential race. That makes it two failed campaigns in one year!” the NRA tweeted after Mr. O’Rourke ended his campaign. “Let this be a lesson: Running on destroying the Second Amendment and stripping Americans of their firearms is never a good idea. #ByeBeto.”
The gun rights organization’s tweet also included an image that read “Hell yes. Beto Fails,” with the former Texas representative giving a “thumbs up” sign.
Mr. O’Rourke captured national headlines in September when he exclaimed, “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,” on a Texas debate stage with  his fellow presidential hopefuls.
“We’re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore,” the Democrat said.


Mr. O’Rourke’s campaign exit was punctuated by a call to “fearlessly champion the issues and causes that brought us together,” and to end an “epidemic of gun violence” and “structural racism.”
