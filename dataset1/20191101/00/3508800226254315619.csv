《勞基法》小教室：老闆傳簡訊性騷擾，如果被惡意解僱該如何自保？
01 Nov 2019, 00:08 by 法操FOLLAW


我們想讓你知道的是老闆可以隨意解僱員工嗎？如果被惡意解僱該怎麼自保？



根據媒體報導，周姓女員工在上班時，收到老闆「要不要牽我的手和我在一起」的簡訊，卻因拒絕與老闆牽手而被解僱。周女不平，上臉書抱怨誇張的解僱事由。張姓老闆得知後，怒告周女誹謗。但經過檢察官調查，發現周女沒有指名道姓，而且從貼文中也無法辨認張男的身分，所以給予不起訴處分。
但老闆可以隨意解僱員工嗎？如果被惡意解僱該怎麼自保？老闆傳這種簡訊算是性騷擾嗎？
老闆可以想叫你走就叫你走嗎？
老闆叫你「明天不用來上班」，可以分成「解僱」和「資遣」這兩種情形。只有當員工出錯，才能「解僱」員工，既然是員工的錯，那麼老闆也不需要付資遣費，也不需要提前告知員工。但如果是老闆的錯，老闆就需要依法給予員工資遣費，並且須遵守法律規定的預告期間，若不能提前預告，則需加給預告期間之工資。
但老闆也不是想資遣就可以資遣，得先符合勞基法第11條規定的五種情況：公司經營不下去或轉讓；虧損或業務緊縮時；發生不可抗力因素導致停工一個月以上，例如天災；業務轉型，不需要這麼多員工；勞工不能勝任工作等。雖然這些規定，感覺已經提供公司足夠的理由可以合法資遣員工，但碰到本案的情形該怎麼辦呢？
如果真的是因為拒絕與老闆交往而被資遣或解僱，這並不符合勞基法合法解除勞動契約的事由。雖然勞基法並未針對違反第11條訂出罰則，但若老闆非法解除勞動契約，不論老闆有沒有給員工資遣費，員工都可以提起確認僱傭關係存在訴訟。若勝訴，老闆除了必須恢復員工的工作，依據民法第487條規定，還需要將訴訟期間的工資都發給員工。
老闆在什麼情況下，可以叫你捲舖蓋離開，卻不用給你一毛錢？
當符合勞基法第12條的事由，雇主就可以不用預告，也無須給予資遣費就請員工離開。但需要注意，大部分的規定是有時效性的，過了30天後才來秋後算帳是不可以的。

張姓老闆的簡訊，算不算性騷擾？
依據性騷擾防治法第2條規定，性騷擾指的是，性侵害以外，對他人實施違反其意願而與性或性別有關之行為。但什麼叫與性或性別有關的行為，其實一直都是大家討論的議題。摸臉算嗎？擁抱算嗎？搭肩算嗎？親臉頰算嗎？
過去在法院的判決中，的確有認為摸臉算是性騷擾。而在政府的宣導下，大家對於性騷擾養成了基本的概念，只要別人不喜歡，基本上就有可能會構成性騷擾。至於本案要求牽手究竟算不算性騷擾呢？
撇開玩大地遊戲的情況，牽手一般來說應該算是對比較親密的人才會有的行為，以法院過去認為摸臉也算性騷擾的見解，牽手的確有可能構成性騷擾。且張男傳簡訊又解雇的行為完全符合利用權勢性騷擾的行為，構成性騷擾防治法第2條1款「以他人拒絕牽手行為，作為其喪失工作的條件」。
但這些都還需要再進行調查：周女是否有覺得被性騷擾，當下的情境為何等等。如果主管機關判定，張男的確有性騷擾的行為，依性騷擾防治法第20條，張男會被處1萬元10萬元以下罰鍰。另外因為張男是老闆，還可能依同法第21條加重科處罰鍰至二分之一。
之前也曾爆出，美國Google包庇「安卓之父」魯賓（Andy Rubin）性騷擾女員工。但Google執行長皮察伊（Sundar Pichai）回應，過去兩年來，公司已開除48名涉及性騷擾的員工，並沒有給這些員工任何資遣費，並表示Google會嚴厲譴責性騷擾行為，給予員工安全的辦公環境。
因為職場會有上下隸屬關係，所以更容易出現性騷擾的問題。各機關或事業單位，應該提供良好的工作環境，不助長性騷擾風氣，並提供完備的申訴管道，讓社會更為平權。

""Laoji Law"" small classroom: the boss sent a brief message of sexual harassment, how to protect themselves if they are maliciously dismissed?
01 Nov 2019, 00:08 by False FOLLAW


What we want you to know is that the boss can dismiss employees at will? How to protect yourself if you are maliciously dismissed?



According to media reports, when Zhou’s female employee got to work, she received a newsletter from her boss, “Would you like to take my hand with me?” but was dismissed for refusing to hold hands with the boss. Zhou is not fair, and she complains about the exaggerated dismissal. After the boss of Zhang’s name was informed, he angered Zhou’s daughter-in-law. However, after investigation by the prosecutor, it was found that Zhou’s woman did not name her name, and she could not identify Zhang’s identity from the post, so she was not charged.
But can the boss freely dismiss employees? How to protect yourself if you are maliciously dismissed? Is the boss’s newsletter a sexual harassment?
Can the boss ask you to leave and ask you to leave?
The boss called you ""not to work tomorrow"" and can be divided into two situations: ""dismissal"" and ""salment"". Only when the employee makes a mistake can the employee be ""dismissed"". Since it is the employee's fault, the boss does not need to pay the severance fee and does not need to inform the employee in advance. However, if it is the boss's fault, the boss will need to pay the employee's severance fee according to law, and must comply with the notice period prescribed by law. If it is not possible to advance the notice, it will be added to the salary during the notice period.
However, the boss does not want to be able to send a job. It must first meet the five conditions stipulated in Article 11 of the Labor Law: the company cannot operate or transfer; when the loss or business is tightened; the force majeure factor causes the work to stop for more than one month, for example Natural disasters; business transformation, do not need so many employees; workers are not qualified for work. Although these regulations, I feel that I have provided the company with sufficient reasons to legally send employees, what should I do if I encounter this case?
If it is really denied or dismissed because of refusal to interact with the boss, this is not in line with the lawful discharge of the labor contract by the Law on Labour. Although Latifah does not set penalties for violation of Article 11, if the boss illegally terminates the labor contract, regardless of whether the boss has paid the employee a severance payment, the employee can file a lawsuit to confirm the employment relationship. If the case is won, the boss must reinstate the employee's work. According to Article 487 of the Civil Code, the wages during the lawsuit must be distributed to the employees.
Under what circumstances can the boss ask you to roll away and leave without giving you a dime?
When the reasons for Article 12 of the Law on Labour are met, the employer can leave the employee without notice and without the severance payment. However, it should be noted that most of the regulations are time-sensitive. After 30 days, it is not acceptable to settle accounts after the fall.

The newsletter of Zhang’s boss is not sexual harassment?
According to Article 2 of the Sexual Harassment Prevention and Control Act, sexual harassment refers to acts that are sexually or gender-related to others in violation of their will, in addition to sexual assault. But what is sexual or gender-related behavior has always been the subject of discussion. Is it a face? Hug it? Should you sit shoulders? Is your cheek count?
In the past, in the judgment of the court, it was indeed considered that the face was considered sexual harassment. Under the government's propaganda, everyone has developed a basic concept of sexual harassment. As long as others do not like it, it is basically possible to constitute sexual harassment. As for the requirements of this case, is it really sexual harassment?
In the case of playing the game of the earth, holding hands should generally be regarded as behaviors for more intimate people. In the past, the court thought that touching faces were also sexual harassment. It is indeed possible to form sexual harassment. Moreover, the behavior of Zhang Men’s newsletter and dismissal is in full compliance with the use of sexual harassment, and constitutes Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Sexual Harassment Prevention and Control Act “to refuse to hold hands as a condition for loss of work”.
However, these need to be investigated again: Does the woman feel that she is being sexually harassed, what is the current situation, and so on. If the competent authority determines that Zhang Nan does have sexual harassment, according to Article 20 of the Sexual Harassment Prevention Law, Zhang Nan will be fined 10,000 yuan and less than 100,000 yuan. In addition, because Zhang Nan is the boss, he may also be subject to a penalty of one-half of the penalty according to Article 21 of the same law.
It has also been revealed before that Google has harassed female employees with the help of Andy Rubin, the father of Android. But Google CEO Sundar Pichai responded that in the past two years, the company has expelled 48 employees involved in sexual harassment and did not pay any severance fees to these employees, and said that Google would severely condemn sexual harassment and give employees safety. Office environment.
Because the workplace has subordinate affiliation, it is more prone to sexual harassment. All agencies or institutions should provide a good working environment, do not encourage sexual harassment, and provide a complete complaint channel to make society more equal.
