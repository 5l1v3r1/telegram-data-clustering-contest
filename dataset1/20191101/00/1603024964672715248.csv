""Market is slowly marching towards the all-time high supported by quarter earnings and government’s measures to attract equity investments. Additionally, strong economic factors like favourable inflation, interest rate, and benign oil prices will support the market sentiment in the long term,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services Ltd, told Moneycontrol.
“Strengthening rupee along with increasing FIIs inflow is indicating a change in FIIs’ negative stance towards emerging markets.”
