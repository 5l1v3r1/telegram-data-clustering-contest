Monitoring alpha-synuclein aggregation is of great interest for studying the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, a group of neurodegenerative diseases that includes Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). The kit provides a solution to rapidly detect and quantify protein aggregates of human alpha-synuclein in cell culture or brain tissue extracts.
