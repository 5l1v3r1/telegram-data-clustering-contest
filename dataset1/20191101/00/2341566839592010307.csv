（中央社記者楊思瑞台南31日電）台中市曉明女中學生今天晚間在台南市楠西區曾文青年活動中心野炊活動時，疑似卡式瓦斯爐離烤肉火源太近爆炸，導致11名學生受到燒燙傷送醫，其中一名學生傷勢較為嚴重。
台南市政府消防局指出，晚間6時38分接獲報案，指稱有學生在曾文青年活動中心野炊時受傷，緊急派遣6車、11人前往救援，先後將11名學生送往醫院醫治。
救護人員初步檢傷後，發現其中一名學生全身約有10%面積出現1至2度燒燙傷，傷勢較嚴重。其餘大多是臉部及手部灼傷。
救護人員現場初步了解，疑似為卡式瓦斯爐擺放位置距離烤肉火源太近，導致瓦斯罐爆炸所引起，但確切事發原因還有待進一步釐清。（編輯：林沂鋒）1081031
