Neil Patrick Harris’ Family Perfectly Transformed Into Famous Art For Halloween
01 Nov 2019 by Mikelle Leow
Some families are all about Christmas. Neil Patrick Harris, David Burtka and their twins Gideon and Harper, on the other hand, are a Halloween family. Each year, they leave fans speechless with their perfect costumes. This year, the two dads decided to nurture their nine-year-olds to become the cultured people they can be. The whole family came dressed as world-famous artworks for Halloween, and Harris showed off the members’ artsy alter egos by editing their portraits into frames. “Welcome to the 2019 Burtka-Harris Boo-seum of Art,” he captioned his photo on Instagram. “Audio guides are available in the gift shop.” Harris channeled Vincent van Gogh and his self-portrait, complete with a chopped-off ear hanging on one of the frame’s borders. Burtka embodied Salvador Dalí, mimicking the Surrealist painter’s iconic wide-eyed expression. Gideon posed with a camera as a mini Andy Warhol, while a unibrowed Harper pulled off her best Frida Kahlo gaze in resplendent garb. The family previously dressed up as “Hitchhiking Ghosts,” a “Carnival of Curiosities,” Hollywood icons, and Star Wars characters. This year, they’re a walking exhibition. See all their extravagant looks below. Advertisement Advertisement
