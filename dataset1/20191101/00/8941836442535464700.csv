Man pleads not guilty in murder of retired town official

01 Nov 2019

SALEM, Mass. (AP) - A Massachusetts man accused of killing a retired town official has pleaded not guilty.
Leedell Graham, of Haverhill, pleaded not guilty to murder charges Thursday in Salem Superior Court in the beating death of 82-year-old Patsy Schena at his Groveland home on June 21.
The Salem News reports 48-year-old Graham was indicted by a grand jury on the murder charge, as well as counts of home invasion and breaking and entering to commit a felony in October.
Schena was the town’s retired building inspector and police say he and Graham knew each other through “business dealings” unrelated to the town.
Prosecutors asked for Graham to continue being held without bail and his attorney did not object but asked the judge to issue the order without prejudice.



Police say this was the town’s first murder since 1992.
