Online Banking Has Become More Widespread Among Consumers


A new survey from Provident Bank might help explain why bank branches are disappearing. Consumers have gotten into the habit of doing their banking digitally, and they strongly prefer it. Only 20% of the consumers in the survey said they would rather visit a bank location than do their business using digital channels. Consumers appear satisfied with their current financial institutions' digital banking offerings: 66% said their bank or credit union's online services met their needs. Banks' online services are proving to be an effective customer retention tool, with 82% of bank customers mentioning their financial institution's online and mobile platforms as a major reason they haven't switched banks.

Kroger Lifts Ban On Visa Credit Cards At Smith's And Food Co. Stores


Kroger, the nation's largest grocer, is reversing its ban on Visa credit cards that affected a small number of its stores.

It expanded the ban in April to the larger Smith's Food & Drug Store chain. Smith's ban on Visa spanned 142 supermarket and 108 fuel center locations across seven states.

Uber Money Is The Company's Latest Attempt To Expand Into Financial Services


Uber is creating a new division called Uber Money to handle its growing financial services business. The group will oversee everything from the company's credit and debit card offerings, to digital wallets for riders, to products used by drivers to get paid in a timely manner. Typically drivers either wait for weekly payments or cash out using a feature called Instant Pay. Now, drivers and other freelance workers like Uber Eats couriers will have real-time access to their earnings after every trip through the Uber Debit account. This mobile bank account will mean that Uber's 4-million-plus drivers and couriers can get their money instantly after every trip or delivery. [The Verge]

The Uber Credit Card Just Got A Refresh With Improved Bonus Categories


The Uber credit card from Barclays has been a strong cash-back credit card ever since it launched in 2019. One ""quirk"" is that it's offered a higher cash-back rate on dining purchases (4% back) than on Uber spending (2% back), but that's changing now. You'll now earn 5% back on all Uber purchases and 3% back on restaurants, bars, hotels, airfare, and vacation rentals. This means the Uber Visa is now the most rewarding cash-back card for Uber purchases. Instead of earning cash back, the Uber card now earns Uber Cash, which you can only redeem with Uber, not for cash back or gift cards. [Business Insider]
