On October 2nd, U.S. District Judge Gerald McHugh, in a landmark case, ruled in favor of Philadelphia nonprofit, Safehouse, that their proposed plan to open a safe injection site in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia was not in violation of the Controlled Substances Act. The ruling effectively gave the green light to continue development for the US’s first safe (or supervised) injection site and a new degree of harm reduction development nationally, but the battle to develop the United State’s first safe injection site is far from over.The site was proposed as a means to combat the staggering death toll of the opioid epidemic by providing those suffering from opioid addiction with, among other things, a safe place to use drugs with access to medical personnel in the case of an accidental overdose, fentanyl test strips, and clean needles to prevent the spread of diseases such as HIV and Hep C, as well as resources for recovery and treatment for participants.
However, the development of the Safehouse safe injection facility was challenged jointly by Pennsylvania prosecutors and the US Department of Justice almost as soon as developments started. Back in February 2019 prosecutors sued to block the development of the facility after the nonprofit ramped up their fundraising and location scouting effort. William McSwain, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, has been outspoken in his condemnation of the facility calling the facility “in-your-face illegal activity”.
Prior to the suit, in November of 2018, McSwain had written a letter to Safehouse imploring them to stop their development of the facility contending that such a facility would normalize drug use and provide an excuse for people to try drugs because they think it’s safe or even legal at such facilities, concluding, “If you and your clients … choose to move forward immediately, then you will force my hand, and I will have no choice but to take the steps necessary to maintain the status quo.” To date, there is no evidence of McSwain’s assertion that safe use sites encourage or increase drug use in communities.
Safehouse ”respectfully disagreed” with McSwain’s assertion and continued with their developments. Three months later Safehouse found themselves in court.
The DOJ’s case against Safehouse relied on a narrow provision of the Controlled Substanced Act, specifically Act, 21 U.S.C. § 856(a)(2)—colloquially known as the “Crack House” statute, which states: “it shall be unlawful to—manage or control any place, whether permanently or temporarily, either as an owner, lessee, agent, employee, occupant, or mortgagee, and knowingly and intentionally rent, lease, profit from, or make available for use, with or without compensation, the place for the purpose of unlawfully manufacturing, storing, distributing, or using a controlled substance.”
But Judge McHugh disagreed with prosecutors stating: “This narrowness of focus reflects a fundamental underlying reality, which is that no credible argument can be made that facilities such as safe injection sites were within the contemplation of Congress either when it adopted § 856(a) in 1986, or when it amended the statute in 2003... there is no support for the view that Congress meant to criminalize projects such as that proposed by Safehouse.”
The ruling is a huge win (at least for now) for harm reduction in the United States, but the legal battle is still raging behind the scenes. McSwain has stated his plans to appeal the ruling and Safehouse similarly has stated their expressed intention to continue with the development of the facility. Similarly, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen warned in a separate statement that, “Any attempt to open illicit drug injection sites in other jurisdictions while this case is pending will continue to be met with immediate action” in an attempt to cool the heals of other interested organizations.

“The ultimate goal [of Safehouse] is to save lives.” Ronda Goldfein, vice president of Safehouse, stated in an October interview, “And it is important to repeat that you can’t recover if you’re not alive.”
As the case develops there will be many eyes on the legal battle as many cities, including Seattle, Denver and New York City, have considered opening their own safe injection sites to address the epidemic siting such facilities effectiveness in Canada and Europe to curb the spread of disease and overdose death, as well as provide an entry point to treatment and long term addiction recovery. “We are optimistic about getting [development and litigation] done this year,” stated Goldfein (a statement McSwain pushed back against in a letter to Safehouse), “and that with [a final ruling] we will be able to operate.”
