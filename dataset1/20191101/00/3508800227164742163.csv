《食物如何改變人》：紅肉是男人的食物、沙拉是女人的菜？
01 Nov 2019, 00:07 by 書傳媒


我們想讓你知道的是《食物如何改變人》指出，比起基因，文化、環境才是影響我們對食物喜好的關鍵，而這種飲食偏見極有可能導致女性貧血，以及男性營養不均衡、輕忽體重過重等問題。



多數人總認為，女性天生就熱愛甜食，男性則非要大口吃肉、大口喝酒，才叫男子氣概，然而英國知名專欄「廚房裡的思想家」作者碧・威爾森在其新書《食物如何改變人》中卻指出，比起基因，文化、環境才是影響我們對食物喜好的關鍵，而這種飲食偏見極有可能導致女性貧血，以及男性營養不均衡、輕忽體重過重等問題，唯有重新檢視你與食物的關係，改變飲食習慣，身心才有可能更健康、更愉快。
女性不是天生就熱愛巧克力，是電視廣告催眠了妳
碧・威爾森表示，從小女性就不斷被傳輸「女孩與巧克力之間都有特殊關係」的觀念，打開電視，幾乎所有巧克力廣告都是針對女性消費者，千篇一律描寫她們無法抗拒巧克力在口中融化的魅力；當月經來潮的時候，一杯熱可可彷彿就是最大的療癒安慰，這其實是一種典型學習而來的行為，因為一般過去的文化總認為「甜點」就是給女性吃的，男性若喜歡這類食物，反而會被視為娘娘腔。
值得注意的是，雖然巧克力確實含有許多對身體有益的物質，大多數女性渴望的卻是牛奶巧克力，偏偏那些有益物質往往在黑巧克力的含量較多，牛奶巧克力裡有的只是糖、脂肪，這些令我們對巧克力上癮，卻又無益健康的成份。所以當妳迫切渴望吃到巧克力時，也許只是糖份在作祟。
紅肉是男人的食物、沙拉是女人的菜？刻板印象造成健康崩壞
認為應該依照性別來吃東西的社會壓力，其實比我們想像得更嚴重，不僅剝奪了進食的樂趣，更有可能危害我們的健康。碧・威爾森以肉類為例，女性常常被認為應該選擇白肉，紅肉則是男性的食物。偏偏，女性才最需要補充紅肉裡的鐵質──根據世界衛生組織的調查，全球有兩百萬人缺鐵，其中女性的數量遠遠高於男性。
不只女性，男性也是飲食偏見的受害者，隨著逐漸長大，他們的蔬果攝取量往往也會驚人下滑。碧・威爾森以最近一項針對英國兒童的研究為例，四到六歲的男孩有70%會吃蘋果，但是對15到18歲的青少年來說，卻只剩下39%還肯吃蘋果；至於女孩，則是隨著年齡增長，有越來越多的人會開始吃沙拉，「這也許是因為她們認為有些食物是自己必須得吃的。」
碧・威爾森指出，將食物分成「男孩的」、「女孩的」，並認為他／她們就該照著這種想法進食，是有害無益的事。但是也不用因此感到擔心，我們對於食物的喜好，全是靠後天學習形成的，試著學習讓自己吃得好，是一種技能，而且不論年齡，你都可以重新調整與食物的關係。

所謂的「口味」是透過特定食物、後天訓練而得；毫無疑問地，「飲食」正是一種學習行為。本書以科學、歷史、文學、甚至是個人回憶錄的方式，完整說明人與食物的關係。也就是──我們如何學會吃，以及飲食文化背後的力量。
英國名廚傑米．奧利佛（Jamie Oliver）一手推動的「吃得更好」（Feed Me Better）計畫，雖以改善學童飲食為目標，卻受到許多家長及學校反對，歷時十年終以失敗收場。多數人以為貧窮家庭的小孩有得吃就好，吃得健康是「上流社會跟中產階級」才須考量的問題。果真如此嗎？身為人母的碧．威爾森在本書中直指核心地告訴我們：每個人都可以吃得更好、更安全。

How does food change people: red meat is a man's food, salad is a woman's dish?
01 Nov 2019, 00:07 by Book Media


What we want you to know is how ""food changes people"" points out that compared with genes, culture and environment are the key factors that affect our preference for food, and this dietary bias is very likely to lead to female anemia and imbalance of male nutrition. Ignore problems such as overweight.



Most people always think that women are born to love sweets, while men have to eat meat and drink too much, which is called masculinity. However, the author of the famous British column ""The Thinker in the Kitchen"", Bi Weison, in his new book, How Food Changes People also pointed out that compared with genes, culture and environment are the key factors that affect our preference for food. This kind of dietary prejudice is very likely to lead to anemia in women, as well as male nutrition imbalance, overweight and overweight. Checking your relationship with food and changing your eating habits will make your body and mind more healthy and enjoyable.
Women are not born to love chocolate, is a TV commercial hypnosis 妳
Bi Weisen said that young women are constantly being transferred the concept of ""there is a special relationship between girls and chocolates"". Turning on TV, almost all chocolate advertisements are aimed at female consumers, and they are all described as unable to resist the melting of chocolate in the mouth. The charm of the cup; when the menstrual cramps, a cup of hot cocoa seems to be the greatest healing comfort, this is actually a typical learning behavior, because the past culture always thinks that ""desserts"" are for women, if men like This kind of food will be regarded as a sissy.
It is worth noting that although chocolate does contain a lot of substances that are good for the body, most women are eager for milk chocolate. However, those beneficial substances tend to be more in dark chocolate, and milk chocolate is only sugar and fat. An ingredient that makes us addicted to chocolate but not healthy. So when you are eager to eat chocolate, maybe it’s just sugar.
Red meat is a man's food, salad is a woman's dish? Stereotypes cause health collapse
The social pressure to think that we should eat according to gender is actually more serious than we think. It not only deprives us of the pleasure of eating, but is more likely to endanger our health. Bi Weier Wilson takes meat as an example. Women are often considered to choose white meat, while red meat is male food. On the one hand, women need to supplement the iron in red meat most. According to the World Health Organization, there are two million people in the world who are deficient in iron. The number of women is much higher than that of men.
Not only women, but men are also victims of dietary prejudice. As they grow older, their intake of fruits and vegetables tends to decline dramatically. Bi Weiersen used a recent study of children in the United Kingdom. For example, 70% of boys between the ages of four and six will eat apples, but for teenagers aged 15 to 18, only 39% will still eat. Apple; as for girls, as people get older, more and more people will start eating salads. ""This may be because they think that some foods must be eaten by themselves.""
Bi Weier pointed out that it is harmful to divide food into ""boys"" and ""girls"" and think that they should eat according to this idea. But we don't have to worry about it. Our preferences for food are all formed by learning from the day after tomorrow. Trying to learn to eat well is a skill, and you can re-adjust your relationship with food regardless of age.

The so-called ""taste"" is obtained through specific food and acquired training; there is no doubt that ""diet"" is a learning behavior. This book provides a complete picture of the relationship between people and food in the form of science, history, literature, and even personal memoirs. That is—how we learn to eat, and the power behind the food culture.
British chef Jamie. The “Feed Me Better” program promoted by Jamie Oliver, which was aimed at improving the diet of school children, was opposed by many parents and schools and ended in failure for ten years. Most people think that children from poor families have to eat well, and eating healthy is a problem that must be considered by the ""upper society and the middle class."" Is that true? Bi as a mother. In the book, Wilson tells us at the core that everyone can eat better and be safer.
