美中科技戰衝擊，「中國製造2025」大推進式發展半導體產業可行嗎？
01 Nov 2019, 00:08 by 巷仔口社會學


我們想讓你知道的是中國半導體產業根基薄弱，是否可能透過類似的「大推進」趕超策略而建設起來？答案似乎並不樂觀。儘管投資許多大尺寸晶圓廠，購買先端設備，可以衝高產量，但在製程的先進性與品質方面，即便從先進國家挖角人才，仍無確實保證。



文：吳介民（中央研究院社會學研究所）
中國目前正遭遇經濟增長率下滑的趨勢、要素成本價格攀升、內生成長動力也在快速趨緩；外部則遭遇美國對中國執行貿易戰與科技戰，華為等中國高科技看板廠商被美國技術抵制。外資ICT組裝業（最重要的台商與韓商）正在急速脫離中國，以美國為主導的全球供應鏈部分，正在經歷「脫中化」過程。中國則喊出「去美國化」。中國遭逢內外夾擊——內有成長降速，外有全球供應鏈重組以及美國漸進圍堵中國態勢——習近平政權如何渡過這個發展危機？如何持續推動產業升級？本文以半導體製造業為例，說明中國產業政策的機會與挑戰，最後並指出台灣在全球半導體產業鏈中的重要性。
一、「中國製造2025」大推進策略
中國政府目前的產業升級路徑，是採取大推進（big push）發展策略。從過去四十年廣東發展經驗中，我們觀察到中國的國家（包括中央與地方政府）通過「在地鑲嵌治理」（locally-embedded governance），介入全球價值鏈的治理，以稅收和尋租手段汲取經濟剩餘（這個龐大剩餘主要由民工勞動力的投入所貢獻），並通過產業政策強勢主導產業升級，強力整治汙染產業等等，進一步回饋到國家權力的增長。因此，中國政府能夠與資本（包含外資與內資）分享經濟剩餘，也使得國家成為價值鏈中的「價值攫取者」。而具有能動性的「在地體制」（local polity），則挾其國家資本與茁壯中的製造能力，與全球資本（核心國家）展開競爭關係。從這個角度觀察，中國目前的產業升級策略，就是利用其累積的製造能力，急欲從「世界工廠」轉型為「世界市場」，操作「市場換技術」、外資所有權限制、自製率規定、強制技術轉移、甚至「侵犯」或「竊取」外國公司智慧財產權等手段，來推動快速的製造能力升級。
因此，從比較的觀點，中國目前正試圖從資本主義世界體系中的「半邊陲」向「核心」挺進，強力推動「彎道超車」策略，繞過美國等西方資本與技術霸權主導的全球產業鏈，自行建構中國掌控的全球產業鏈，而期待在此產業鏈中攫取更大的利益份額。因此，中國採取類似加強版的韓國路數，即大推進策略，但由於中國的經濟規模、國家性質與國家權力強大，使得中國政府扮演比韓國政府更積極、更強勢的指令角色，一次性投入大量資本，由國家扮演出資與融資角色，並採取多種補貼政策與市場保護策略，推動國家扶植的產業項目。
在此宏大企圖心驅動之下，中國從2011年開始執行的《十二五規劃》強調發展內需市場，並以此為基礎開拓外銷市場，所謂「紅色供應鏈」的說法就是這個階段的產物。2014年，國務院設立扶植本土半導體（集成電路）產業的「大基金」，第一期募資人民幣1300多億元；2018年宣布加碼募資3000億元。2015年國務院進一步發布《中國製造2025》文件，同一年由「國家製造強國建設戰略諮詢委員會」動員「48位院士、400多位專家」討論制定，公布了「《中國製造2025》重點領域技術路線圖」，羅列10項關鍵產業，包含半導體、AI製造與機器人、航空航天、高技術船舶、軌道裝備、新能源汽車、電力裝備、農業裝備、新材料、生醫等產業。這份規劃書可說是一份趕超西方核心國家製造技術的「目錄」，展示了中國實現「創新驅動、轉型升級」的雄心。在此藍圖下，中國廣泛宣傳「中國製造2025」，加緊對外獲取技術，使得這個規劃案舉世矚目。但是這個大戰略的可行性如何呢？它可能遭遇到哪些阻礙？
由於「中國製造2025」牽涉產業範圍廣大，這裏僅就藍圖中的半導體產業做評估。「大基金」設立之後，據報導，中國在2016年業已規劃，將在2018-2020年間將新建26座晶圓廠，其中一些是「大基金」扶植對象。但大基金投資布局涵蓋整體半導體供應鏈，包括晶圓製造、IC設計、封裝測試、設備和零組件、特殊材料等領域。
二、合資、市場換技術、挖角
目前在中國營運和新設立的晶圓廠，大致有三種所有權操作模式：

外資獨資，例如台積電原在上海已經有一座8吋廠，目前在南京投資30億美元建造一座12吋，採用16奈米製程，已經在2018年5月開始出貨。
合資或合作，例如「聯芯」，由台灣聯電與國營企業「大唐電信」合資；「格羅方德」（Global Foundries）與成都市政府合作設廠；「晶合」由台灣力晶與合肥市政府合作，初步投資由合肥官方出資，力晶以參股方式技術合作；「南京德科碼」與以色列塔爾（Tower Jazz）合作，塔爾提供技術專家與營運整合資訊，並取得新設八吋晶圓廠50%產能，擴展中國國內市場。
中資主導，例如「中芯國際」上海廠，2008年中芯國際引入大唐電信作為戰略投資者，第一大股東變為國資。「大基金」將中芯視為國產芯片的龍頭企業進行扶持。2017年6月「大基金」已成為第二大股東，持股比例為15.91%。2015年，中芯與華為、IMEC（比利時微電子研究中心）和高通合組公司，研發14奈米製程。2017年，中芯聘請前台積研發主管梁孟松擔任聯合首席執行長，負責研發部門。2016年，「紫光集團」和「武漢新芯」合併成立「長江存儲」，據報導也挖角原在台灣DRAM大廠的董事長擔任營運長。

從上述營運方式，大致可以看到幾個特色。第一，半導體產業是高度資本密集與技術密集的產業，資金需求非常龐大，因此在原先並無先進半導體製程的中國，政府與國營企業便承擔關鍵推動角色。「大基金」目前在晶圓製造端的投資，包括中芯等六家知名廠商。第二，「以市場換技術」，是中國要求外商合資的主要策略。中國規定半導體產業的自製率，對外商的要求便有政策文件規定，因此中方便要求外商進入中國設廠，或以合資或合作形式做技術轉移，「這樣外商對中國客戶有交代，拿中國訂單壓力就減低一些。」第三，挖角人才是中國經常使用的手段，主要是來自美國、韓國、新加坡與台灣的人員（參見熊瑞梅等人，2017）。在上述案例中，台資與台灣技術人才能見度頗高。第四，中國大量興建新晶圓廠，不論未來產品品質如何，將會在2020年後爆發相當大的產能，對市場結構造成影響。
三、製造文化是中國技術落後台灣的主因
其實中國在半導體產業已經部署多年，但距離世界最先進技術一直存在相當大差距。以「中芯國際」（SMIC）為例，設立於2000年，是中國媒體曝光度最高的8吋廠。目前在中國共投資7家晶圓廠，義大利投資1家，但產品良率一直受到業界質疑。中芯最初是由台灣「出走」的張汝京團隊成立，但設廠不久即遭到台積電控告其侵犯智慧財產權（知識產權）。2009年雙方達成和解協議，中芯賠償台積電2億美元，並授予8%中芯股分給台積電。目前中芯在製程技術方面的進展，根據其財務報告，2018年第一季度在28奈米製程節點的銷售額，只占總銷售額的3.2%，而在40/45奈米節點占21.7%，55/65奈米節點占20.9%，150/180奈米占38.9%。
對照在晶圓代工技術屬於全球領先廠商的台積電，早在2011年即進入28奈米製程量產；估計在2018年6月進入7奈米製程。因此，「中芯與台積電的製程技術的差距至少三代，相差7-10年。」（訪談：FH201806） 而在營業績效方面，台積電2017年營收為320億美元，全球市占率55.9%；中芯為31億美元，全球市占率為5.4%。台積電2018第一季的毛利率為50%，中芯為26.5%，兩者差距相當大。
中國晶圓市場在2015年占世界純晶圓代工市場11%，2016年占12%，由於新設立晶圓廠逐漸投產，2017年估計增加到13%，達到70億美元。其中台積電占中國市場46%，中芯作為中資半導體龍頭只占21%。2018年7月，美國中央處理器（CPU）大廠超微（AMD）證實已與台積電合作試產出第一顆7奈米Rome伺服器處理器，並委託台積電進行量產。這表示台積電在7奈米製程取得全球領先地位，並協助超微在技術上超越英特爾（Intel）。
中芯設立將近二十年，仍然無法拉近與台積電的技術差距，業界一般都指向製造經驗、技術累積、知識產權與「文化」問題。從中芯與台積電的技術能力比較，可以窺知中國趕超核心國家技術的焦慮。中國是否可能在半導體產業，複製之前在電信產業、高鐵產業的成功經驗？過去，中國在與日本和德國合作而獲取高速鐵路技術，利用中國廣闊市場急速建設路網而建構起產業鏈，並開始對外輸出軌道產業。然而，中國半導體產業根基薄弱，是否可能透過類似的「大推進」趕超策略而建設起來？答案似乎並不樂觀。儘管投資許多大尺寸晶圓廠，購買先端設備，可以衝高產量，但在製程的先進性與品質方面，即便從先進國家挖角人才，仍無確實保證。一位業界人士評論：「半導體產業需要的技術深度，與『文化』有關。中國現在的產業文化鼓勵週期短的產品，但IC產業週期長、需要穩紮穩打，跳槽與挖角，不適合IC產業的特性。」（訪談：LM201805）
談到文化，有時更像是製造行為習慣上的差異，半導體廠房的潔淨要求非常高。一位曾經在晶圓廠工作的工程部經理說：「我的老闆曾經在北京參觀一家半導體晶圓廠，親眼看到作業員用推車搬運設備零件，要進入無塵廠房時沒有更換裡面的推車，就這樣推進去，輪子上黏附的灰塵就跟著帶入廠房。在台灣，是一定要將設備搬上廠房內部專屬的推車，也就是要換車，但是中國作業員不知道是疏忽或懶散了，沒有遵照這個SOP，就這樣給它進去了。」（訪談：FH201806）
台灣業界對於中國以人才挖角取得技術的方法，也一直有質疑的聲音。在「中國製造2025」藍圖中，對半導體產業，中國訂定了逐年提升自製率的高目標，例如2020年IC內需市場自製率要達40%，2025年至70%，但是在中國獲取相關技術困難的情況下，能否達成是一大疑問。而且，中國試圖通過挖角台灣與其他先進國家人才達成技術轉移的可行性也不高，因為技術轉移涉及許多智慧財產權與專利問題，中方很難迴避這些專利障礙。中芯侵犯台積電智慧財產權挨告賠款和解，就是一個教訓；梁孟松協助三星電子也曾被台積電控告。目前梁孟松進入中芯擔任領導角色，是否能夠協助趕超台積電製程，一般業界並不看好。
2017年廣州黃埔區政府和廣州開發區管委會，與張汝京合作籌組粵芯半導體公司，是一家12吋晶圓廠。張汝京提出所謂CIDM模式（Commune Integrated Device Manufacturer，協同式整合元件製造廠），這個模式結合芯片（晶片）設計、終端應用企業客戶與芯片製造廠（foundry），由三方共同投資，解決資金籌募問題，共同承擔風險。此種合作模式來自於新加坡的「TECH半導體公司」，在中國是新嘗試，粵芯尚在籌設階段（2017年底舉行項目動工儀式），但共同投資有其操作的複雜性，CIDM模式是否適合中國模仿也受到質疑。根據中國媒體2018年3月報導，粵芯「與廣州方面簽約之後就沒有了下文，此項目可能已流產。」
四、美中科技戰的衝擊
早在2012年美國眾議院情報委員會的調查報告中，便指出華為與中興對美國國家安全造成潛在威脅，因為這兩家公司被認為與中國政府有密切關係。2018年4月，美國商務部以「中興通訊」違反規定提供美國製晶片給伊朗為由，公布對其「禁運」七年。這個制裁措施，使中國第二大電信設備公司中興無法取得關鍵晶片與技術，對其發展5G通訊是重大打擊。6月，中興答應支付高額罰款並撤換高管，換取美國解除部分制裁。中興事件發生在美中貿易戰即將開打的時刻，實非偶然。多年來，華為（中國第一大通訊設備公司）一直打不開美國市場，即使花費大筆資金從事政治遊說，仍然無法緩解美國政府對華為與中國軍方（與政府）關係的疑慮。美國的政府報告多年前就質疑華為產品存在對美國國家安全的威脅。2018年7月，美中貿易戰正式開打，而科技戰已先打了前鋒，美國這回對中國經濟圍堵，劍指「中國製造2025」。
2018年12月1日，華為副董事長兼財務長孟晚舟（華為總裁任正非的女兒）被加拿大逮捕，理由是涉嫌違反美國出口管制向伊朗出售敏感科技，並以假帳掩護。事件發生，中國舉國譁然，中國政府逮捕兩名加拿大人；中國各地發起「挺華為」活動，聲討美國及其盟友的聲浪大起。中國《環球網》發出社評「讓仗勢侵害中國利益的國家付出代價。」中國官方與輿論反應，再次顯露出「重振中華帝國慾望」受挫時悲憤交加的集體情緒。美國持續遊說盟國抵制華為5G網路設備。美國司法部於2019年1月28日宣布起訴孟晚舟。目前孟晚舟的引渡官司尚在加拿大進行。孟晚舟事件對華為在全球佈局5G網路造成極大挑戰，也是美國主導反擊中國之科技戰的最前哨。2019年5月，川普政府出針對華為下重手，將華為與70家相關企業列入「黑名單」，不准美國企業（以及美國科技內容超過25%的外國企業）出口高科技產品給華為，企圖切斷華為核心晶片等組件的供應鏈。
美國抵制中興與華為，揭開了中國科技實力的斷層線，讓我們有機會觀察到中國經濟發展的虛實。在中興事件刺激下，中國掀起一陣「缺芯之痛」輿論熱潮。事件發生不久，習近平到武漢烽火集團考察時，強調「核心技術、關鍵技術、國之重器必須立足於自身。……過去在外部封鎖下，我們自力更生，勒緊褲腰帶、咬緊牙關創造了『兩彈一星』，這是因為我們發揮了社會主義制度優勢——集中力量辦大事。」他在視察武漢「新芯集成電路」，指示要實現「兩個一百年」奮鬥目標，一些重大核心技術必須靠自己攻堅克難，要依賴自主研發，加快芯片技術突破。台灣業界傳言：大陸官方授意當地面板龍頭昌京東方必須有逾五成的驅動IC都採用大陸自製產品，更下達「良率不好沒關係，先用再說」的指令。
中興事件加速了中國本來已經在極力推動的半導體工業。從過去中國官員浮誇吹噓的「放衛星」歷史經驗，目前推動晶圓廠建設的方式充滿風險。爭相投資建設中的晶圓廠，總是攀比技術水平與建廠、投產速度。晶圓廠由於設備昂貴，投資非常鉅大，機器非常「燒錢」，光刻機（極紫外線EUV曝光機）一臺就要1.2億歐元左右。我們從中國官員與企業慣有的尋租行為來預測，購買如此昂貴的機器設備，投機倒把的空間很大。再者，在「放衛星」集體心態驅動下，如果真的是「領導說了算，不顧成本與品質硬上」，放在半導體產業脈絡中，是非常不理性的趕超行為，在與西方科技戰的刺激下，舉國同「芯」並不能快速累積半導體所需的製造文化。
在「中國製造2025」指導下，中國試圖趕超世界先進製造技術，跳躍到全球價值鏈頂端，以此模式推動經濟持續發展。這個產業升級大策略是否確實可行？目前仍是個大問號。
五、台積電的領先地位與挑戰
目前美中對抗大格局下的科技戰，凸顯了台灣在半導體供應鏈上的重要性。華為所屬的海思具有設計高階晶片的能力（例如麒麟行動處理器），但是中國在高階晶片製造上仍須委託台積電執行。台積電雖在全球晶片製造上居於領先，一向相當低調謹慎，但許多分析報導仍不斷證實台積電的關鍵性，包括製造美國國防工業尖端晶片（參見New York Times, Oct. 25, 2019）。台積電是台灣極少數（若非唯一）位居全球價值鏈頂端的公司，其技術創新、規模、與品質皆位列尖端。2019年10月，台積電甚至超越Intel，成為全球半導體產業市值最高的公司。
因此，當中國半導體製造能力仍不足，至少在目前階段，華為在製造先進晶片上仍需依賴台積電。根據前印《紐約時報》報導，美國因為國防安全等考量，希望遊說台積電在美國設廠，但新設先進晶圓廠資金非常龐大（一座動輒150-200億美金），而在美國營運台積電等級晶圓廠成本遠高於台灣，因此台積電甚至跟美國談到了補貼。這件事例凸顯所謂「製造文化」包含著複雜的經濟地理與人文社會結構因素，難以「去鑲嵌地」建造先進晶圓廠。因此，中國想操作「彎道超車」大推進策略來推動「中國製造2025」，例如半導體製造能力大升級，是相當困難。
從台積電退休不久的創辦人張忠謀如此評估：「雖然面對中國半導體企業的來勢洶洶，而且不斷的進步。台積電在這段期間也將會不斷進步，不管是在技術或是在效能上，都會領先對岸競爭對手至少5年，不過這領先的時間應該會在10年左右。中國在10年後將會逐漸地追趕上來，所以大家並不能大意。」張忠謀對台灣半導體產業樂觀但審慎的展望，對映出中國急切的趕超心態。
在美中對抗格局下，中國遭遇美國在晶片供應上的「斷鏈」威脅，亟思尋找出路，提出所謂「去美國化」，並積極拉攏台灣與南韓的相關廠商。在此變動中的國際地緣政治經濟結構，美國恐怕也關心台積電是否與中國走得太近，甚或成為中國競爭半導體技術的助攻手。由此可見，台灣對自己的科技製造能力應該更有信心，也須善用這個能力來保障自己的生存。

The US-China science and technology war has hit, is it possible for the ""Made in China 2025"" large-scale development of the semiconductor industry?
01 Nov 2019, 00:08 by Xiangzikou Sociology


What we want you to know is that the foundation of China's semiconductor industry is weak. Is it possible to build up through a similar ""big push"" catch-up strategy? The answer does not seem to be optimistic. Although investing in many large-scale fabs and purchasing apex equipment can increase production, there is no guarantee in the advancement and quality of the process, even if it is from the advanced countries.



Text: Wu Jiemin (Institute of Sociology, Academia Sinica)
China is currently experiencing a downward trend in economic growth rate, rising factor cost prices, and slowing down internal power generation. The outside is confronted with US trade and technology warfare against China, and Chinese high-tech kanban manufacturers such as Huawei are resisted by US technology. . The foreign-funded ICT assembly industry (the most important Taiwanese and Korean businessmen) is rapidly deviating from China, and the US-led global supply chain is undergoing a “de-neutralization” process. China shouted ""de-Americanization."" China has been caught both inside and outside – there has been a slowdown in growth, a global supply chain restructuring and a gradual blockade of the Chinese situation in the United States – how has the Xi Jinping regime weathered this development crisis? How to continue to promote industrial upgrading? This article takes the semiconductor manufacturing industry as an example to illustrate the opportunities and challenges of China's industrial policy, and finally points out the importance of Taiwan in the global semiconductor industry chain.
I. ""Made in China 2025"" big promotion strategy
The current industrial upgrading path of the Chinese government is to adopt a big push development strategy. From the development experience of Guangdong in the past four decades, we have observed that Chinese countries (including central and local governments) are involved in the governance of global value chains through taxation and rent-seeking through “locally-embedded governance”. Drawing on the economic surplus (this huge surplus is mainly contributed by the input of the labor force of the migrant workers), and through industrial policies to lead the industrial upgrading, strong rectification of the polluting industries, etc., and further feedback to the growth of state power. Therefore, the Chinese government can share economic surplus with capital (including foreign capital and domestic capital), and it also makes the country a “value learner” in the value chain. The dynamic ""local polity"" is a competitive relationship between its state capital and its manufacturing capabilities, and its global capital (core countries). From this perspective, China's current industrial upgrading strategy is to use its accumulated manufacturing capacity, eager to transform from ""world factory"" to ""world market"", operate ""market-for-technology"", foreign ownership restrictions, self-control rate regulations, mandatory Technology transfer, and even ""infringement"" or ""stealing"" the intellectual property rights of foreign companies to promote rapid manufacturing capacity upgrades.
Therefore, from a comparative point of view, China is currently trying to advance from the “half-border” to the “core” in the capitalist world system, strongly promoting the “Curve Overtaking” strategy and bypassing the global capital and technological hegemony dominated by the United States. The industrial chain builds its own global industrial chain under its control and expects to gain a greater share of the benefits in this industrial chain. Therefore, China adopts a similarly enhanced version of South Korea's roads, that is, a big promotion strategy. However, due to China's economic scale, national nature and strong state power, the Chinese government plays a more active and stronger command role than the Korean government. Capital, the state plays a role of financing and financing, and adopts a variety of subsidy policies and market protection strategies to promote the state-supported industrial projects.
Driven by this ambitious attempt, China's 12th Five-Year Plan, which began in 2011, emphasizes the development of the domestic demand market and uses this as a basis to open up the export market. The so-called ""red supply chain"" is the product of this stage. In 2014, the State Council set up a “big fund” to support the local semiconductor (integrated circuit) industry. The first phase raised more than 130 billion yuan; in 2018, it announced an additional fundraising of 300 billion yuan. In 2015, the State Council further issued the ""Made in China 2025"" document. In the same year, the ""National Manufacturing Power Construction Strategy Advisory Committee"" mobilized ""48 academicians, more than 400 experts"" to discuss and formulate the ""China Manufacturing 2025"" key areas of technical routes. The map lists 10 key industries, including semiconductors, AI manufacturing and robotics, aerospace, high-tech ships, track equipment, new energy vehicles, power equipment, agricultural equipment, new materials, and biomedical industries. This plan can be said to be a ""catalog"" that catches up with the manufacturing technology of the core countries in the West, demonstrating China's ambition to achieve ""innovation-driven, transformation and upgrading."" Under this blueprint, China has widely publicized ""Made in China 2025"" and stepped up its access to foreign technology, making this planning project world-famous. But what is the feasibility of this big strategy? What obstacles might it encounter?
Since ""Made in China 2025"" involves a wide range of industries, it is only an evaluation of the semiconductor industry in the blueprint. After the establishment of the ""Big Fund"", it is reported that China has planned in 2016 that 26 new fabs will be built between 2018 and 2020, some of which are the targets of the ""big fund"". But the big fund investment layout covers the entire semiconductor supply chain, including wafer fabrication, IC design, packaging and testing, equipment and components, and special materials.
Second, joint venture, market exchange technology, digging angle
Currently operating in China and newly established fabs, there are roughly three modes of ownership operation:

Foreign-owned sole proprietorship, such as TSMC, already has an 8-inch plant in Shanghai. It is currently investing US$3 billion in Nanjing to build a 12-inch, 16-nanometer process, which has been shipped in May 2018.
Joint venture or cooperation, such as ""Lianxin"", joint venture between Taiwan UMC and state-owned enterprise ""Dantang Telecom""; ""Global Foundries"" (Chengde) set up a factory in cooperation with Chengdu government; ""Crystal"" by Taiwan Powerchip and Hefei Municipal Government cooperated, the initial investment was funded by Hefei officially, and Powerchip cooperated in technology cooperation; “Nanjing Deco Code” cooperated with Tower Jazz of Israel, and Taal provided technical experts and operational integration information and obtained new eight吋 Fab's 50% capacity to expand China's domestic market.
Chinese-funded, such as the ""SMIC"" Shanghai plant, in 2008 SMIC introduced Datang Telecom as a strategic investor, and the largest shareholder became state-owned. The ""Big Fund"" will support SMIC as a leading company in domestic chips. In June 2017, “Big Fund” became the second largest shareholder with a shareholding ratio of 15.91%. In 2015, SMIC and Huawei, IMEC (Belgian Microelectronics Research Center) and Qualcomm Group Corporation developed a 14-nm process. In 2017, SMIC hired Liang Mengsong, the head of R&D at the front desk, as the co-chief executive, responsible for the R&D department. In 2016, ""Ziguang Group"" and ""Wuhan Xinxin"" merged to form ""Yangtze River Storage"". It is reported that the company also served as the chief operating officer of Taiwan's DRAM manufacturer.

From the above operating methods, you can see a few features. First, the semiconductor industry is a highly capital-intensive and technology-intensive industry with huge capital requirements. Therefore, in China, where there is no advanced semiconductor manufacturing process, the government and state-owned enterprises will play a key role. The “big fund” is currently investing in wafer manufacturing, including six well-known manufacturers such as SMIC. Second, ""market-for-technology"" is China's main strategy for foreign-invested joint ventures. China stipulates the self-manufacturing rate of the semiconductor industry. The requirements for foreign merchants are stipulated in the policy documents. Therefore, it is convenient for foreign companies to enter China to set up factories, or to make technology transfer in the form of joint ventures or cooperation. ""This way foreign investors have to explain to Chinese customers and take Chinese orders. The pressure will be reduced. Third, the talents are often used by China, mainly from the United States, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan (see Xiong Ruimei et al., 2017). In the above cases, Taiwanese and Taiwanese technicians are highly visible. Fourth, China has built a large number of new fabs. Regardless of the quality of future products, it will explode considerable capacity after 2020, affecting the market structure.
Third, manufacturing culture is the main reason why Chinese technology is behind Taiwan.
In fact, China has been deployed in the semiconductor industry for many years, but there is still a considerable gap from the world's most advanced technology. Taking SMIC as an example, it was established in 2000 and is the most exposed 8-inch factory in China. Currently investing in seven fabs in China and one in Italy, but the product yield has been questioned by the industry. SMIC was originally established by the Zhang Yijing team of Taiwan's “going away”, but the factory was soon accused by TSMC of infringing intellectual property rights (intellectual property rights). In 2009, the two parties reached a settlement agreement. SMIC compensated TSMC for US$200 million and awarded 8% of the SMIC shares to TSMC. At present, SMIC's progress in process technology, according to its financial report, sales in the 28nm process node in the first quarter of 2018, accounting for only 3.2% of total sales, while 21.7% at 40/45 nm nodes 55/65 nm nodes account for 20.9%, and 150/180 nm accounts for 38.9%.
Compared with TSMC, which is a global leader in foundry technology, it entered the 28nm process mass production as early as 2011; it is estimated to enter the 7nm process in June 2018. Therefore, ""the gap between SMIC and TSMC's process technology is at least three generations, a difference of 7-10 years."" (Interview: FH201806) In terms of business performance, TSMC's 2017 revenue was $32 billion, with a global market share of 55.9%; SMIC is $3.1 billion, with a global market share of 5.4%. The gross profit margin of TSMC 2018 in the first quarter was 50%, and the SMIC was 26.5%. The gap between the two is quite large.
The Chinese wafer market accounted for 11% of the world's pure foundry market in 2015 and 12% in 2016. Due to the gradual commissioning of new wafer fabs, it is estimated to increase to 13% in 2017, reaching US$7 billion. Among them, TSMC accounts for 46% of the Chinese market, and SMIC only accounts for 21% of Chinese semiconductor leaders. In July 2018, AMD, a US central processing unit (CPU), confirmed that it had cooperated with TSMC to produce the first 7-nm Rome server processor and commissioned TSMC for mass production. This indicates that TSMC has achieved global leadership in the 7nm process and assisted AMD in technically surpassing Intel.
For nearly 20 years, SMIC has been unable to close the technological gap with TSMC. The industry generally points to manufacturing experience, technology accumulation, intellectual property and ""culture"" issues. Comparing the technical capabilities of SMIC and TSMC, we can see the anxiety of China's catching up with the technology of the core countries. Is it possible for China to replicate its successful experience in the telecommunications industry and high-speed rail industry in the semiconductor industry? In the past, China cooperated with Japan and Germany to acquire high-speed railway technology, used China's vast market to rapidly build a road network and built an industrial chain, and began to export the rail industry. However, China's semiconductor industry has a weak foundation. Is it possible to build up through a similar ""big push"" catch-up strategy? The answer does not seem to be optimistic. Although investing in many large-scale fabs and purchasing apex equipment can increase production, there is no guarantee in the advancement and quality of the process, even if it is from the advanced countries. An industry source commented: ""The technological depth required by the semiconductor industry is related to ""culture."" China's current industrial culture encourages short-term products, but the IC industry has a long cycle, needs to be stable and stable, and it is not suitable for the characteristics of the IC industry. (Interview: LM201805)
When it comes to culture, it is sometimes more like the difference in manufacturing habits. The cleanliness requirements of semiconductor factories are very high. A manager of the engineering department who once worked at the fab said: ""My boss once visited a semiconductor fab in Beijing. I saw the operator using the cart to carry the parts of the equipment. When I entered the dust-free factory, I did not replace it. The cart is pushed forward in this way, and the dust adhering to the wheels is brought into the factory. In Taiwan, it is necessary to move the equipment to the exclusive cart inside the factory, that is, to change the car, but the Chinese operator does not know that it is negligence. Or lazy, did not follow this SOP, so I entered it."" (Interview: FH201806)
The Taiwanese industry has always had doubts about how China has used its talents to gain technology. In the ""Made in China 2025"" blueprint, for the semiconductor industry, China has set a high goal of increasing the self-made rate year by year. For example, in 2020, the IC domestic demand market will have a self-made rate of 40%, 2025 to 70%, but acquire relevant technologies in China. In difficult circumstances, it is a big question whether it can be achieved. Moreover, China's attempt to achieve technology transfer through Taiwan and other advanced countries is not very feasible. Because technology transfer involves many intellectual property rights and patent issues, it is difficult for China to avoid these patent barriers. SMIC invaded TSMC's intellectual property rights and reported compensation settlements. This is a lesson; Liang Mengsong assisted Samsung Electronics in being accused by TSMC. At present, Liang Mengsong has entered the leadership role of SMIC, and whether he can help catch up with the TSMC process, the general industry is not optimistic.
In 2017, Guangzhou Huangpu District Government and Guangzhou Development Zone Management Committee, together with Zhang Yujing, organized Guangdong Semiconductor Company, a 12-inch wafer fab. Zhang Yujing proposed the so-called CIDM model (Commune Integrated Device Manufacturer), which combines chip (wafer) design, terminal application enterprise customers and chip manufacturers (foundry), and jointly invests in solving the fundraising problem. And share the risks. This cooperation model comes from Singapore's ""TECH Semiconductor Company"", which is a new attempt in China. The Guangdong core is still in the preparatory stage (the project commencement ceremony is held at the end of 2017), but the co-investment has the complexity of its operation, and the CIDM model is suitable. Chinese imitation has also been questioned. According to Chinese media reports in March 2018, Guangdong Core “has no following the contract with Guangzhou, and the project may have been miscarried.”
Fourth, the impact of the US-China science and technology war
As early as the investigation report of the US House Intelligence Committee in 2012, it pointed out that Huawei and ZTE pose a potential threat to US national security because the two companies are considered to have close ties with the Chinese government. In April 2018, the US Department of Commerce announced the ""embargo"" for seven years on the grounds that ""ZTE"" violated the regulations by providing US-made chips to Iran. This sanction has made it impossible for China's second-largest telecom equipment company, ZTE, to acquire key chips and technologies, which is a major blow to its development of 5G communications. In June, ZTE promised to pay a high fine and replace the executives in exchange for the United States to lift some sanctions. It is no accident that the ZTE incident occurred at the moment when the US-China trade war is about to start. For many years, Huawei (China's largest communications equipment company) has been unable to open the US market. Even if it spends a lot of money on political lobbying, it still cannot alleviate the US government's doubts about Huawei's relationship with the Chinese military (and the government). The US government reported many years ago that Huawei products pose a threat to US national security. In July 2018, the US-China trade war was officially launched, and the science and technology war had already hit the striker. The United States has blocked the Chinese economy this time, and the sword refers to ""Made in China 2025.""
On December 1, 2018, Huawei’s vice chairman and chief financial officer Meng Xizhou (the daughter of Huawei’s president Ren Zhengfei) was arrested in Canada on the grounds that it was suspected of violating US export controls to sell sensitive technology to Iran and was covered by false accounts. The incident occurred, China’s national stunned, the Chinese government arrested two Canadians; all over China launched the “Taihua” campaign, denying the United States and its allies a loud voice. China's ""World Wide Web"" issued a social commentary ""to pay the price for the country that has invaded China's interests."" The Chinese official and public opinion reaction once again revealed the collective sentiment of grief and indignation when the ""revitalization of the Chinese Empire's desires"" was frustrated. The United States continues to lobby the allies to boycott Huawei's 5G network equipment. The US Department of Justice announced on January 28, 2019 that it had sued Meng Xiazhou. At present, Meng’s extradition lawsuit is still in Canada. The Meng Xiazhou incident caused great challenges to Huawei's global deployment of 5G networks, and it was also the most outpost of the US's leading scientific and technological war against China. In May 2019, the Trump administration issued a ""blacklist"" for Huawei and 70 related companies, and did not allow US companies (and foreign companies with more than 25% of US technology content) to export high-tech products. Huawei is trying to cut off the supply chain of components such as Huawei's core chips.
The US boycott of ZTE and Huawei unveiled the fault line of China's scientific and technological strength, giving us the opportunity to observe the reality of China's economic development. Stimulated by the ZTE incident, China has set off a wave of public opinion that is ""the pain of lack of core."" Shortly after the incident, Xi Jinping went to Wuhan Fenghuo Group to inspect, emphasizing that ""the core technology, key technologies, and the country's heavy equipment must be based on themselves.... In the past, under the external blockade, we were self-reliant, tightening our belts and clenching our teeth. ""Two bombs and one star"", this is because we have taken advantage of the socialist system - concentrate on doing big things."" He is inspecting Wuhan ""new core integrated circuits"" and instructing to achieve the ""two hundred years"" struggle goal, some Major core technologies must rely on their own to overcome difficulties, rely on independent research and development, and accelerate the breakthrough of chip technology. Taiwanese industry rumors: The mainland officially instructed the local panel leader Changjing Oriental must have more than 50% of the driver ICs to use mainland-made products, and even issued the ""good yield does not matter, first use again"" instructions.
The ZTE incident has accelerated the semiconductor industry that China has been pushing. From the historical experience of ""sending satellites"" that Chinese officials have boasted in the past, the way to promote fab construction is full of risks. The fabs that are competing to invest in construction are always comparing the technical level with the speed of building and commissioning. Because the fab is expensive, the investment is very huge, the machine is very ""burning money"", and the lithography machine (extreme ultraviolet EUV exposure machine) will cost about 120 million euros. We predict from the rent-seeking behavior of Chinese officials and companies that buying such expensive machinery and equipment has a lot of room for speculation. Moreover, under the driving force of the ""single satellite"" collective mentality, if it is really ""leaders have the final say, regardless of cost and quality,"" it is very irrational catch-up behavior in the semiconductor industry. Under the stimulation of the science and technology war, the national core and the ""core"" cannot quickly accumulate the manufacturing culture required for semiconductors.
Under the guidance of ""Made in China 2025"", China has tried to catch up with the world's advanced manufacturing technologies and jump to the top of the global value chain to promote sustainable economic development. Is this industry upgrade strategy really feasible? It is still a big question mark.
V. TSMC's leading position and challenges
The current scientific and technological war under the US-China confrontation pattern highlights Taiwan's importance in the semiconductor supply chain. Huawei's HiSilicon has the ability to design high-end chips (such as the Kirin mobile processor), but China still has to commission TSMC to implement high-end wafer manufacturing. Although TSMC is leading the world in wafer manufacturing, it has always been relatively low-key and cautious, but many analysis reports continue to confirm the criticality of TSMC, including the manufacture of cutting-edge chips for the US defense industry (see New York Times, Oct. 25, 2019). TSMC is one of the few (if not the only) companies in Taiwan that ranks at the top of the global value chain, and its technological innovation, scale, and quality are among the best. In October 2019, TSMC even surpassed Intel to become the company with the highest market value in the global semiconductor industry.
Therefore, when China's semiconductor manufacturing capacity is still insufficient, at least at this stage, Huawei still needs to rely on TSMC in manufacturing advanced chips. According to the pre-printed ""New York Times"" report, the United States hopes to lobby TSMC to set up a factory in the United States because of national security considerations, but the new advanced fab is very expensive (one is about $150-$20 billion), while the US station is rated by the company. The cost of a round factory is much higher than that of Taiwan, so TSMC even talked about subsidies with the United States. This case highlights the so-called ""manufacturing culture"" which involves complex economic geography and humanistic social structural factors, making it difficult to ""de- mosaic"" the construction of advanced fabs. Therefore, it is quite difficult for China to operate the ""Curve Overtaking"" big promotion strategy to promote ""Made in China 2025"", such as the semiconductor manufacturing capacity upgrade.
Zhang Zhongmou, the founder who retired from TSMC, commented: ""Although facing the trend of Chinese semiconductor companies and continuous improvement, TSMC will continue to improve during this period, whether in terms of technology or performance. The competitors on the other side have been at least 5 years, but this lead time should be around 10 years. China will gradually catch up after 10 years, so everyone can't care."" Zhang Zhongmou's optimistic but cautious outlook for Taiwan's semiconductor industry, right Reflecting China’s eagerness to catch up.
Under the US-China confrontation pattern, China has encountered the threat of ""broken chain"" in the supply of wafers in the United States. It is looking for a way out, proposing the so-called ""de-Americanization"" and actively attracting relevant manufacturers from Taiwan and South Korea. In this changing international geopolitical and economic structure, the United States may also be concerned about whether TSMC is too close to China or even become a competitor for China's competitive semiconductor technology. From this we can see that Taiwan should have more confidence in its technological manufacturing capabilities and must use this ability to protect its survival.
