David Byrne’s American Utopia @ Hudson TheatreDavid Byrne has retooled his acclaimed “untethered” 2018 for the Broadway stage and while the setlist and arrangements are much like what they were on his tour, songs are now threaded together with new monologues from Byrne, making for a much more theatrical experience.
The Original Robert Glasper Experiment @ Blue Note (two shows)Robert Glasper is on the final run of shows in his month-long Blue Note Jazz Club residency, which will find him playing with The Original Robert Glasper Experiment (Glasper, Derrick Hodge, Chris Dave, Casey Benjamin) through November 3.

Black Moon @ S.O.B.’sBrooklyn rep vets Black Moon recently returned with their new album Rise of Da Moon, which finds them doing what they do best (guests include Method Man, Smif-N-Wessun, Tek, and more). Tonight’s the hometown NYC release show.
Lee Ranaldo, Leila Bordreuil, Stephan Moore, Asha Sheshadri, The New York Review of Cocksucking @ Issue Project RoomISSUE Project Room calls this “an expansive gathering of NYC artists working across disciplines” and includes Sonic Youth’s Lee Ranaldo collaborating with cellist Leila Bordreuil.
Dave Harrington’s Merry Pranksters @ Nublu 151Darkside’s Dave Harrington brings together a constantly evolving but always supremely talented group of Merry Pranksters. Tonight’s late-night show includes Stuart Bogie, Shahzad Ismaily, Kenny Wollesen, and more…. plus “VERY Special Guests.”
Mike Doughty (plays Soul Coughing’s Ruby Vroom) @ Rough TradeMike Doughty will perform his old band’s classic 1994 debut in full.
Carmen Christopher, Conner O’Malley @ Union HallCarmen Christopher (HBO, Comedy Central) & Conner O’Malley (Late Night with Seth Meyers) bring you “some new goddamn good material.”
