購票網站投資「掃瞄臉部入場」新技術，為何遭到抗議反對？
01 Nov 2019, 00:08 by FORTUNE
文：Dan Reilly譯：劉松宏
去（2018）年，購票網站Ticketmaster宣布投資一項新技術，這項技術可以讓歌迷參加音樂會和其他活動時，無需一一排隊等候驗票。唯一的缺點是什麼？這意味著要對你的臉部進行數位掃描，並且將其上傳到第三方公司Blink Identity。該公司的攝影機會識別你獨特的臉部尺寸，在你走進場館時就可以與門票做配對。
Ticketmaster尚未準備好該系統，但是針對這項功能的擔憂，已使得數位版權倡導組織「為未來而戰」（Fight for the Future）感到震驚，該組織最近發起了「禁止人臉辨識」運動，以打擊這種被認為「不可靠、造成混亂且對基本人權及安全造成威脅」的科技。這種多管齊下的努力，某方面來說得到了公共政策促進倡議組織「前進」（MoveOn.org）、「美國伊斯蘭關係委員會」（CAIR）和綠色和平組織（Greenpeace）等組織的支持，其重點是防止在現場音樂場所中使用這項科技，無論背後是哪間公司在運作。
在副組長伊凡．葛里爾（Evan Greer）的帶領下，這項運動獲得了眾多音樂家的幫助，包含討伐體制樂團（Rage Against the Machine）的Tom Morello、Speedy Ortiz的賽迪．杜普伊斯（Sadie Dupuis）、身兼歌手作曲家的阿曼達．帕爾默（Amanda Palmer）和說唱歌手Atmosphere等人，一起將之推廣到全世界。葛里爾和公司隨後發布了「音樂會報告單」，其中列出了主辦方發誓永不使用這項科技的活動節目。
截至目前為止，Bonnaroo音樂藝術節、Pitchfork音樂節、Governors Ball紐約音樂節和Electric Forest，都表示不會使用這項科技。科切拉音樂節（Coachella）、Lollapalooza音樂節和電子音樂節EDC則尚未表態。（當被《財富》雜誌詢問意見時，科切拉音樂節、Stagecoach鄉村音樂節和Hangout Fest的主辦方Goldenvoice表示：「我們目前不希望在這個報導中討論此內容。」）
Ticketmaster目前尚未使用這項科技，並且已經有許多音樂節也承諾不會使用，那麼為什麼「為未來而戰」還要發起抵制運動？葛里爾告訴《財富》雜誌：「我們現在事先組織起來是很重要的，以防止這種科技迅速流行到各大現場音樂活動中。這項技術變得越來越普遍、也越來越便宜。重要的是要未雨綢繆，一旦生米煮成熟飯後要再復原就會困難很多。現在正是我們站出來制止的時刻。」
即便Ticketmaster就此事發表了聲明：「我們目前尚無計劃在用戶的場所部署人臉辨識技術，請放心，未來任何的考量都將經過嚴格把關，一定會給予粉絲選擇的權力。」仍不足以平息葛里爾的恐懼。她說道：「如果Ticketmaster不打算將人臉辨識用於監視目的，那麼為何不明確地給出承諾呢？即使他們表示會以用戶自願的方式使用該科技來進入活動場合，仍然會引起重大的隱私和公民自由問題。粉絲們仍然需要進行搜身檢查，因此並沒有節省到任何時間。這只是在音樂迷族群中收集大量數據的藉口。」
正是這些數據收集的行為，讓那些反對人臉辨識科技的運動人士感到不安。將《財富》雜誌的評論徵求信轉寄給Ticketmaster的Blink Identity，不僅大力推廣造訪自家網站之便利性，還宣傳了其創始人「花了近十年的時間在中東為美國國防部建造和部署大規模生物識別系統」，以及「其系統讓收集每個人的可用和可共享數據變得可能」的事實。
以其最無害的點來看，該技術可能會參照Walgreens藥妝店和Tesco加油站廣告的方式，來用於針對用戶做廣告，向用戶展示可能感興趣的產品，並收集品牌數據。以其隱藏的危機來看，「為未來而戰」表示，這項科技可能會變成執法機構和政府試圖辨識罪犯或無證移民的工具。
葛里爾說道：「一旦私人企業開始收集生物辨識資訊，並將該資訊儲存在某個地方的數據庫中，執法部門就會希望獲得他們的幫助。」
「我們經常會聽到「這與公共安全有關」。但真實情況是，收集高度敏感的生物特徵資訊並將其儲存在數據庫中，是極其不安全的──如果美國海關及邊境保護局（Customs and Border Protection）透過第三方承包商維護的數據庫之一，遭到駭客入侵，那該怎麼辦？
最經典的例子就是《華盛頓郵報》（Washington Post）的爆炸性新聞：美國移民暨海關執法局（U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement，ICE）一直以來，都在無證移民能夠取得駕駛執照的區域中，使用車輛管理局（DMV）數據庫的人臉辨識搜索系統。你可以輕易地想像一家私營企業在加利福尼亞等大型音樂節上架設人臉辨識系統，而美國移民暨海關執法局要求探訪或獲取該數據。還有另一個明顯的潛在用途，是針對擁有少量毒品的族群。當政府能夠大規模進行自動化監視時，會急劇地增加人們被針對、騷擾或搜索小小違規行為的可能性，這些違規行為在此類型活動中，經常是被認為普遍正常的。」
另一項議題是，除了舊金山、奧克蘭和馬薩諸塞州的薩默維爾市以外，幾乎沒有任何有關完全禁止使用人臉辨識的規定。儘管有證據表明Amazon Rekognition會誤認女性和人種膚色，但該公司仍在向警察和包括美國移民暨海關執法局在內的政府機構，出售其圖像分析系統。該公司目前也正在制定法律，希望政府予以採納。
葛里爾說道：「我們缺少一種有效的方法，來追究這些公司的責任。目前還沒有一項政策要求他們保持資訊透明，因此是時候由音樂表演家和歌迷動員，並要求這些濫用我們所喜愛的音樂活動的公司，提高透明度和負起責任。」
為了達到這個目的，隨著抵制人臉辨識的運動獲得更多的知名度和支持，音樂表演家們拒絕參加採用該技術的場地和音樂節活動，想必也是十分合理的。以消費者的態度而言，該技術也已經被證明不受大眾歡迎，最近皮尤研究中心（Pew）對4000多名美國人進行的一項研究顯示，只有36％的受訪者表示，信任科技公司會負責任地使用人臉辨識，而只有17％的受訪者表示信任廣告業者。
Speedy Ortiz的賽迪．杜普伊斯（Sadie Dupuis）說道：「Speedy Ortiz經常利用我們的表演影響我們歌迷，和世界的議題募款並吸引關注，即使這些議題與音樂本身無關。我認為現在很多樂隊也是如此。」她設立了一支求援專線，以幫助那些在她的演出期間感到沒有安全感的人，並要求在場館內設置性別友善廁所，以及其他保護粉絲的措施。杜普伊斯也提到：「我們將在未來的計劃中，加入我們對於這項人臉辨識議題的立場，我也很高興地注意到我們最喜歡的一些音樂節，已經針對這種侵入性監視持反對立場。」
到目前為止，「為未來而戰」發起的運動在啟動後的3週內，已經取得了令人興奮的成果，並且將會延伸到體育館、購物中心和其他人們聚集的大型場所。
葛里爾說道：「採用人臉辨識和生物識別監控技術的公司，將音樂產業視為潛在的巨大市場。但由於世界上許多最大的音樂節都承諾永不使用這項技術，還有許多音樂家和粉絲的強烈反對，想必會讓他們感到大失所望。我們更廣泛的全國性運動正在如火如荼地發展。如果我們能夠表明立場表示：『我們不希望私人公司在音樂節上對人群進行人臉辨識。』那將非常重要，因為我們可以針對這類型的科技，在自由、開放和民主的社會中究竟扮演什麼樣的角色，有更廣泛的討論。」

Why did the ticket-buying website invest in the ""scanning face admission"" new technology, why was it protested against it?
01 Nov 2019, 00:08 by FORTUNE
Text: Dan Reilly translation: Liu Songhong
In the (2018) year, Ticketmaster, the ticketing site, announced a new technology that would allow fans to participate in concerts and other events without having to wait in line for ticket inspections. What is the only drawback? This means doing a digital scan of your face and uploading it to a third-party company, Blink Identity. The company's photography opportunities identify your unique face size and can be paired with tickets as you walk into the venue.
Ticketmaster is not ready for the system, but concerns about this feature have shocked several copyright advocacy organizations, ""Fight for the Future,"" which recently launched the ""No Face Recognition"" campaign. Fight against such technology that is considered ""unreliable, causing confusion and posing a threat to basic human rights and security."" This multi-pronged effort has, in some respects, been supported by organizations such as MoveOn.org, CAIR and Greenpeace. The focus is on preventing the use of this technology in live music venues, no matter which company is behind the operation.
In the deputy head of the team Ivan. Led by Evan Greer, the sport has been helped by a number of musicians, including Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine and CCID of Speedy Ortiz. Sadie Dupuis, Amanda, a singer composer. Amanda Palmer and rapper Atmosphere and others have promoted it to the world. Greer and the company subsequently released a ""concert report"" that listed the event that the organizer vowed never to use the technology.
To date, the Bonnaroo Music Festival, the Pitchfork Festival, the Governors Ball New York Music Festival and Electric Forest have all said they will not use the technology. Coachella, Lollapalooza and EDC have not yet expressed their views. (When asked by Fortune magazine, the Coachella Music Festival, Stagecoach Country Music Festival and Hangout Fest organizer Goldenvoice said: ""We don't want to discuss this in this report."")
Ticketmaster is not currently using this technology, and there are already many festivals that promise not to be used. So why do you want to fight against the future? Greer told Fortune magazine: ""It is very important that we organize it in advance to prevent this technology from quickly becoming popular in live music events. This technology is becoming more and more common and cheaper. The important thing is to plan ahead. It will be much harder to recover after the raw rice is cooked. Now is the time we stop to stop.""
Even Ticketmaster issued a statement on the matter: ""We have no plans to deploy face recognition technology in the user's place. Please be assured that any consideration in the future will be strictly checked and will give fans the power to choose."" Still not enough to calm down Greer's fear. She said: ""If Ticketmaster does not intend to use face recognition for surveillance purposes, why not give a clear commitment? Even if they say they will use the technology to enter the event in a voluntary way, it will still cause significant privacy. And the issue of civil liberties. Fans still need to conduct a body search, so they don't save any time. This is just an excuse to collect a lot of data in the music fan community.""
It is these data collection behaviors that make those who oppose face recognition technology feel uneasy. Forwarding Fortune’s comment request letter to Ticketmaster’s Blink Identity not only promotes the convenience of visiting its own website, but also advertises that its founder “have spent nearly a decade building and deploying the US Department of Defense in the Middle East. A large-scale biometric system, and the fact that its system makes it possible to collect the available and shareable data for everyone.
At its most harmless point, the technology may use Walgreens drug store and Tesco gas station advertising to advertise to users, show users products that may be of interest, and collect brand data. In the face of its hidden crisis, ""war for the future"" said that this technology could become a tool for law enforcement agencies and governments trying to identify criminals or undocumented immigrants.
Greer said: ""Once private companies start collecting biometric information and store it in a database in one place, law enforcement will want to get their help.""
""We often hear ""this is related to public safety."" But the reality is that collecting highly sensitive biometric information and storing it in a database is extremely insecure—if one of the databases maintained by the US Customs and Border Protection through a third-party contractor What should I do if I am attacked by a hacker?
The most classic example is the explosive news of the Washington Post: US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been used in areas where undocumented immigrants can obtain a driver's license. A face recognition search system for the Vehicle Authority (DMV) database. You can easily imagine a private company setting up a face recognition system at a major music festival such as California, and the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau requires access to or access to the data. There is another obvious potential use for people with a small amount of drugs. When the government is able to conduct automated surveillance on a large scale, it will dramatically increase the likelihood that people will be targeted, harassed or search for minor violations. These violations are often considered to be generally normal in this type of activity. ""
Another issue is that there are few provisions for the complete ban on the use of face recognition except for San Francisco, Oakland and Somerville, Massachusetts. Although there is evidence that Amazon Rekognition will misidentify women and human skin, the company is still selling its image analysis system to police and government agencies, including the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The company is also currently enacting laws that it hopes the government will adopt.
Greer said: ""We lack an effective way to hold these companies accountable. There is no policy to keep them transparent, so it is time for music performers and fans to mobilize and ask for abuse of what we love. The company of music events, to increase transparency and take responsibility.""
In order to achieve this goal, with the popularity and support of the campaign to resist face recognition, music performers refused to participate in the venue and music festival activities using this technology, presumably very reasonable. In terms of consumer attitudes, the technology has also proven to be unpopular. A recent study by Pew Research Center (Pew) on more than 4,000 Americans showed that only 36% of respondents said that trust Technology companies use face recognition responsibly, while only 17% of respondents believe they trust advertisers.
Speedy Ortiz's Sadie. Sadie Dupuis said: ""Speedy Ortiz often uses our performances to influence our fans, raise funds and attract attention to the world's issues, even if these issues are not related to the music itself. I think many bands are now."" A help-seeking line was set up to help those who felt insecure during her performance and asked to set up gender-friendly toilets and other measures to protect the fans. Dupuis also mentioned: ""We will join our position on this face recognition issue in future plans. I am also pleased to note that some of our favorite music festivals have been targeted at this intrusiveness. Surveillance is against the position.""
So far, the campaign ""For the Future"" has achieved exciting results within three weeks of its launch and will extend to stadiums, shopping centers and other large venues where people gather.
Greer said: ""Companies that use face recognition and biometric monitoring technology see the music industry as a potentially huge market. But because many of the world's biggest music festivals promise to never use this technology, there are still many music. The strong opposition of the family and the fans will surely make them feel disappointed. Our wider national campaign is developing in full swing. If we can show our position: ""We don't want private companies to identify people on the festival at the festival. That would be very important because we can have a broader discussion about what kind of technology this type of technology plays in a free, open and democratic society.""
