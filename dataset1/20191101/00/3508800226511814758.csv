為什麼台灣吸引不到香港的高階人才？
01 Nov 2019, 00:08 by 財訊


我們想讓你知道的是台灣曾被英國牛津經濟研究院預測為2021年全球最缺人才區域，台灣本地人才流失始終也是問題，從這次港人未立刻付諸實際行動移居台灣的情況，也再次凸顯台灣從薪資到稅制的結構性問題。

港人移民必備的「良民證」申請，過去4個月多達1.2萬多宗，較去年同期激增近5成。據香港民意研究所調查，港民對台灣政府的好感度近年有持續上升趨勢。移民講座更場場爆滿，台灣相關主題的活動，更是從1個月兩場增加到8場。
然而，根據台灣內政部移民署統計，近4年來，港民居留台灣人口平均約4000人，定居約1000人，總計移居來台人士數量十分穩定，儘管用百分比來看，今年前8個月來台定居人士較同期增長26%，但實則不過增加157人。
根據統計，香港中產階級移民仍首選加拿大、美國、澳洲和英國，資金較少的才選擇台灣或馬來西亞。但台北到香港才1個多小時的飛行距離，消費指數也相對較低，總體而言，台灣與葡萄牙、愛爾蘭，是港人詢問度較高的3大熱門移居地。
香港本地有移民公司稱，諮詢移居意願「爆炸性增長」，真正施行移民計畫者也較2014年雨傘運動時增加一倍，有小孩的家庭更傾向諮詢當天就簽約，但不少人對移居台灣卻只停留在諮詢。
痛點1：薪資水準普遍偏低
「人才不安全感很高，想往外移、很想逃。」1名科技金融領域的人力仲介公司主管說，最近接觸的很多這樣的香港高階人才。這名主管表示，她自2012年開始就接觸不少企業需要金融衍生商品交易員，但始終沒有談下任何1位港人，就算只計算香港本地一流畢業生人才的薪水，年薪至少也要給出270萬台幣，「光這樣就很難。」
畢竟開放港澳人士居留的16個種類條件中，無論是學術、科學、金融等專業技術能力，只要是高階主管，在任何一個國家其實都屬高薪人士。這位人力仲介公司主管指出，台灣的薪水結構和企業文化都影響港人來台意願，加上嫁接香港國際環境的在台外商選擇性少，更降低吸引力。

痛點2：稅制不利吸引高階人才
另外，稅制也是關鍵。以高薪香港居民為例，若年薪新台幣約600萬元，已婚育有1子，孩子12歲，父母年滿70歲並同住，由該居民所撫養。在台灣應稅額度約新台幣107萬元，但在香港應稅額僅新台幣47萬元多。最大差異在於台灣最高稅率為40%，但香港最高超額累進稅率僅17%，可謂收入愈高，繳稅差額愈大。
外籍、外僑人士在台工作，若按在台居住未滿183天，扣繳20%，居住超過183天以上，則視為本國人。台灣個人所得是以家庭為單位，採綜合所得結算申報制。依照級距計算，年薪只要450萬元以上都以40%課稅。金融人士指出，通常公司會將日期鎖定在183天內，避用本國人納稅標準。
香港則以應納所得額為計稅依據，薪俸採用15%的標準或2%~17%，實行4級超額累進稅率。比起台灣稅制，在港扣稅省很多。
為提高港人專業人士來台就業意願，財政部訂定《外籍專業人士租稅優惠之適用範圍》，依規定，公司所支付本人及眷屬的來回旅費、返港度假旅費等，均不計入為收入課稅。這算是小小的優惠，但整體稅制誘因仍不足以吸引港人來台工作。
痛點3：工作前景不如新加坡
香港反送中運動前，香港青年因憂慮「粵港澳大灣區發展」產生的負面影響，有調查顯示，港青認為能在創新科技、金融業和專業服務這3項上占優勢，較願意離港從事相關工作，但港人認為，新加坡比台灣更有機會取代香港。
東吳大學講座教授顏慶章呼籲，「台灣要成為亞太金融重鎮，配備條件很高，現在調整為時已晚」，鼓勵放寬投資移民，吸納港資、人才，有助於未來國家發展。移民署也曾在2014年放寬在台就學生畢業留台定居規定，但港生在台就學人數近年未見提升，教育部國際司與海外聯招會皆認為，在港本地升學和赴大陸進修的優惠措施增加，已對台產生排擠效應。
實際上，兩年前台灣就被英國牛津經濟研究院（Oxford Economics）預測為2021年全球最缺人才區域，台灣本地人才流失始終也是問題。從這次港人未立刻付諸實際行動移居台灣，再次凸顯台灣從薪資到稅制的結構性問題，值得台灣政府思考。

Why is Taiwan not attracting high-level talent from Hong Kong?
01 Nov 2019, 00:08 by Finance


What we want you to know is that Taiwan was once predicted by the Oxford Economic Research Institute as the world's most talented region in 2021. The local brain drain in Taiwan is always a problem. From this time, Hong Kong people did not immediately put into practice to move to Taiwan. Highlight the structural problems of Taiwan from salary to taxation.



Text: Wu Yale
The number of applications for ""good citizen cards"" for Hong Kong immigrants has increased to nearly 12,000 in the past four months, a surge of nearly 50% compared with the same period last year. According to the Hong Kong Institute of Public Opinions, the sentiment of Hong Kong people to the Taiwan government has continued to rise in recent years. The immigration lectures were full and the activities related to Taiwan's related topics increased from two to two in one month.
However, according to the statistics of the Immigration Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China, in the past four years, the average population of Hong Kong residents living in Taiwan has reached 4,000 and settled in about 1,000. The total number of people who have moved to Taiwan has been very stable, although in terms of percentage, the first eight months of this year. Taiwan settlers increased by 26% over the same period, but in reality they increased by 157.
According to statistics, Hong Kong middle-class immigrants still prefer Canada, the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom, and Taiwan or Malaysia is the only one with less capital. However, Taipei has only been flying to Hong Kong for more than one hour, and the consumption index is relatively low. Overall, Taiwan, Portugal and Ireland are the three most popular places for Hong Kong people to ask for more.
Hong Kong local immigration companies said that the willingness to move is ""explosive growth"", and the number of immigrants who actually implement immigration plans has doubled compared with the umbrella movement in 2014. Households with children are more likely to sign contracts on the day of consultation, but many people have moved to Taiwan. But only stayed in the consultation.
Pain point 1: salary level is generally low
""The talent insecurity is very high. I want to move outside and I want to escape."" A head of the human resources agency in the technology finance sector said that many of these high-level talents in Hong Kong have recently been contacted. The director said that she has been in contact with many companies for financial derivatives traders since 2012, but she has never talked about any Hong Kong people. Even if she only calculates the salary of Hong Kong's top local graduates, the annual salary must at least be given. Out of 2.7 million Taiwan dollars, ""It is very difficult to light.""
After all, among the 16 types of conditions for Hong Kong and Macao residents to stay in, whether they are academic, scientific, financial and other professional and technical skills, as long as they are high-level supervisors, they are actually high-paying people in any country. The head of the human resources agency pointed out that Taiwan's salary structure and corporate culture all affect the willingness of Hong Kong people to come to Taiwan, and the non-selectivity of Taiwanese foreigners who grafted Hong Kong's international environment is less attractive.

Pain point 2: The tax system is unfavorable to attract high-level talents
In addition, the tax system is also the key. Take high-paying Hong Kong residents as an example. If the annual salary is NT$6 million, one child is married and the child is 12 years old. The parents are 70 years old and live together and are raised by the residents. The taxable amount in Taiwan is about NT$1.07 million, but the taxable amount in Hong Kong is only NT$470,000. The biggest difference is that Taiwan's highest tax rate is 40%, but Hong Kong's highest excess progressive tax rate is only 17%. The higher the income, the greater the tax difference.
Foreign and foreigners working in Taiwan are considered to be nationals if they have lived in Taiwan for less than 183 days, withholding 20% and living for more than 183 days. Taiwan’s personal income is based on the family, and the comprehensive income settlement system is adopted. According to the calculation of the rank, the annual salary of only 4.5 million yuan or more is subject to 40% taxation. Financial sources pointed out that usually the company will lock the date to 183 days, avoiding the tax standards of the nationals.
In Hong Kong, the amount of income is based on the amount of income, and the salary is 15% or 2% to 17%, and the level 4 is excessively progressive. Compared with the Taiwan tax system, there are many tax deductions in Hong Kong.
In order to enhance the willingness of Hong Kong professionals to come to Taiwan, the Ministry of Finance has set the ""Scope of Application of Tax Allowance for Foreign Professionals"". According to the regulations, the travel expenses of the company and its relatives, the return travel expenses, etc. are not counted. Taxing income. This is a small concession, but the overall tax incentives are still not enough to attract Hong Kong people to work in Taiwan.
Pain point 3: Work prospects are not as good as Singapore
Before the Hong Kong anti-delivery campaign, Hong Kong youths were worried about the negative impact of the development of the Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau Bay Area. Some surveys show that Hong Kong Green believes that it can dominate the three areas of innovation, technology, financial industry and professional services. Leaving Hong Kong for related work, but Hong Kong people believe that Singapore has a better chance of replacing Hong Kong than Taiwan.
Yan Qingzhang, a lecturer at Soochow University, called on ""Taiwan to become a major financial city in the Asia-Pacific region with high standards. It is too late to adjust now."" Encourage the relaxation of investment immigration and attract Hong Kong capital and talents to help the country's future development. In 2014, the Immigration Department also relaxed the rules for the settlement of students in Taiwan. However, the number of students enrolled in Hong Kong has not improved in recent years. The International Department of the Ministry of Education and the Overseas Joint Recruitment Association believe that studying in Hong Kong and going to the mainland for further study. The increase in preferential measures has already had a crowding out effect on Taiwan.
In fact, two years ago, Taiwan was predicted by the Oxford Economics to be the world's most talented region in 2021. The local brain drain in Taiwan was always a problem. From this time, Hong Kong people did not immediately put into practice to move to Taiwan, once again highlighting Taiwan's structural problems from salary to taxation, which deserves the Taiwan government's thinking.
