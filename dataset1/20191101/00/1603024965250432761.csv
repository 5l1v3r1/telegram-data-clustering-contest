Shrikant Vishnu Gadale, the farmer hailing from Wadmauli village, made the request on October 31, in a letter written to Governor Bhagar Singh Koshyar.
Gadale wrote that farmers have suffered heavy losses this season due to the floods that saw several parts of Maharashtra inundated. It left huge amounts of crops destroyed and hence the administration needs to become functional at the soonest to help out the distressed farmers.
CloseIn the letter written in Marathi, he said: “Natural calamities have wreaked havoc on ready-to-harvest crops in Maharashtra. It has left hundreds of farmers in limbo. At a time when the poor peasants are suffering so much, the Shiv Sena and the BJP are not being able to resolve their power tussle.”



“Therefore, until the deadlock is over, the Governor must appoint me as the interim chief minister to solve the problems of the farmers and do them justice.”
