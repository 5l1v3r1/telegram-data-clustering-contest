01 Nov 2019 by Vivienne Decker

The stocking stuffer is one of the best parts of the holiday season. And every family has a different tradition. While some open stockings the night before, as a little prelude to all the excitement to come, my family always opened them after all the presents were unwrapped, to top off the morning. The best stocking stuffers are ones that will excite wonder and curiosity, and beg to be opened right away. Here are my favorite picks for children.
