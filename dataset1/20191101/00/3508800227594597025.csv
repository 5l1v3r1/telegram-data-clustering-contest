馬紹爾群島：被核試爆23次的美麗之國
01 Nov 2019, 00:08 by 田中健人


我們想讓你知道的是馬紹爾群島位於太平洋的中間，最大環礁是瓜加林環礁，這也是世界上最大的環礁。不過瓜加林環礁的主權屬於馬紹爾群島共和國，但治權卻依然是美國的。這故事說來話長，要從二戰開始談起。



從飛機上往下看，馬紹爾群島是一個又一個的環礁，窄細的珊瑚礁島嶼環繞著潟湖，偶而會有地形斷裂造成的孤島。馬紹爾群島的首府馬久羅，就是標準的環礁地形。這裡的道路非常特別，最窄的地方左右兩邊看去都是海，一側是風平浪靜的潟湖，另外一邊則是波濤洶湧的太平洋，潟湖上停著船隻點點，甚是美麗，說是世界上最美麗的國家也不為過。
不過馬紹爾群島經濟落後，過多的人口分佈在不夠居住的房屋，只好輪流住，有些人白天睡覺，有些人晚上睡覺，夜晚的路上也總有人在路邊閒聊，社區裡每個人大概都互相認識，治安當然很好；不過外交官、各國技術團都很怕這些夜不閉戶的當地人，因為所有誰跑去誰家的八卦他們都一清二楚。此外，潟湖看起來風平浪靜，但當地人都知道裡面有致命的海洋弧菌，因此極少看到有人在市區附近下水，只有初來乍到的外國人才會幹這種蠢事。
馬紹爾群島原來是德國的地盤，但德國並沒有積極統治這塊領土，僅作為青島艦隊的停泊點。第一次世界大戰後，國際聯盟將馬紹爾群島交給日本託管，日本人在這裡蓋神社、捕魚，也派遣了密克羅尼西亞地區的管理官員。第二次世界大戰之後，治權又交給美國，美國在這裡建立軍事基地、進行核子試驗，給當地帶來很多困擾。1986年，馬紹爾群島共和國才正式從美國獨立出來。
馬紹爾群島位於太平洋的中間，最大環礁是瓜加林環礁，這也是世界上最大的環礁。不過瓜加林環礁的主權屬於馬紹爾群島共和國，但治權卻依然是美國的。這個故事說來話長，1943年12月，美軍接連攻陷屬吉里巴斯管轄的塔拉瓦和馬金島之後，隨即劍指世界最大環礁瓜加林。由於瓜加林環礁有廣大的潟湖，可供停泊航空母艦，一旦被美軍攻陷，日本的「絕對防衛圈」就會不保，因此日軍也逐步加強固守。
環礁地形的島嶼其實稱不上是「島」，它只是很多礁石的組合，海拔甚至經常不足一、兩公尺。到任的日軍指揮官秋山門造，想要模仿其他島嶼的固守方案，在瓜加林環礁興建碉堡。但受限於地形，壕溝只要往下挖一公尺，海水就會湧出來，所有的掩蔽建物幾乎都沒辦法興築。
1944年2月2日，兩軍正式在瓜加林環礁開打。這裡雖然事關絕對防衛圈陷落與否，卻不在日本的絕對防衛圈內。日本國內此時已經為了應付左右戰線焦頭爛額，實在沒有能力撥用兵力支援瓜加林戰事。秋山要求各隊固守，但三天內瓜加林及馬紹爾群島諸環礁隨即陷落，秋山也在戰事第一天時就被美軍砲彈炸死。
攻陷瓜加林環礁之後，美軍就再也沒有離開過這裡。1960年代起，美軍在這裡建立飛彈測試場，瓜加林這邊原先的居民，就被遷往其他島嶼。取而代之的，是美國每一年給馬紹爾群島每年1800萬美元，必須在瓜加林專款專用的補償金，這些錢一直到獨立之後依然由美國給付，只是看起來並沒有抵達居民手中。今日的瓜加林環礁依然是美軍基地，美軍在這裡蓋房子、開泳池，據說頗有熱帶風情，和周邊落後的經濟條件頗有落差。但這裡就是殖民者的地盤，如果沒有拿到美軍的簽證，連馬紹爾人也無法進入瓜加林島。

馬紹爾群島的悲劇當然不止於此，1946年起，美國選定馬紹爾群島的另一個地方比基尼環礁作為核試爆的地點。從第一次「十字路口行動」（Operation Crossroads）開始，美方一共在太平洋執行過67次核子試爆，比基尼環礁（Bikini Atoll）佔了其中23次。因為核試爆本身震撼力太強，同年法國巴黎推出的兩節式泳裝，便取比基尼作為命名，意指泳裝的性感也將和核彈一樣震撼世界。
並沒有很多人聞問比基尼環礁上的167位居民，當然，美軍有透過各種方法把他們遷走。他們失去了家園，也沒有得到好照顧，直到美國政府終於在輿論壓力下讓他們遷徙到比較適合居住的其他島嶼上重建家園，並接受美軍大量的肉品、蔗糖和罐頭援助，導致嚴重的「三高」問題，這些風波也延燒了不少年。
但這至少還算是有受到照顧的，在比基尼環礁附近，有些人沒有受到應有的警告跟照顧，卻因為科學家們沒把風向算好而倒了大楣。1954年，美國在這裡核試發生意外。當然，核試爆之前，美軍已經在比基尼群島以西畫了1萬4600平方公里的禁航區，但當天的風卻往東邊吹。巨大的蕈狀雲捲起無數的輻射珊瑚礁，灑落在比基尼群島東邊的各環礁島嶼上，而當地人只感到懶散、昏沉而毫無防備，直到美軍發現事態嚴重才將他們集中治療。此事並未公開，一直到看不過去的美軍官兵在休假時向美國媒體揭露，才得到注意。
但這起意外之所以鬧大，其實跟日本有關。核爆當時，日本漁船「第五福龍丸」正在比基尼群島東側作業，船員遭受大量輻射落塵汙染。3月14日，「第五福龍丸」完成捕魚任務，於燒津入港，後續船員陸續被檢測出大量輻射殘留，但是漁獲已經進入市場，引起消費者大恐慌。東京的築地魚市場拍賣中止，鮪魚價格暴跌，政府把「核爆魚」埋在市場的一角，並組成「核爆魚對策本部」天天測量魚市場的核汙染狀況。
六個月後，「第五福龍丸」無線長久保山愛吉死亡，作為世界上唯一曾經遭到大規模核子攻擊的國家，日本對於核汙染議題異常敏感，因此也引起了多次大規模反美抗爭。這些事件和後來的《美日安保條約》抗爭、佐藤榮作首相針對沖繩問題的「非核三原則」都有關係。此外，有名的恐龍電影《哥吉拉》，也是從這起事件延伸而來的靈感，甚至到了最新的「正宗哥吉拉」時，還有一句「不能讓日本成為世界上唯一一個二度遭到核攻擊國家」這類的台詞。
不過在冷戰期間，日本政府需要美國支持，因此這些事情最後也都不了了之。比如1996年東京地鐵大江戶線興建時，據說會挖到當年築地市場埋藏的「核爆魚」地點，但市府最後宣稱「什麼也沒挖到」，就是一件都市奇談。至於事件的受害者「第五福龍丸」本身，因為核爆無法再出任務，被展示在江東區的夢之島公園。
由於輿論不滿，在馬紹爾群島那邊，美國每一年都會提供大量的金錢、物資援助，美國同時也會要求台灣、日本分擔部分的支持。現在馬紹爾群島上，只有美國、日本、台灣三國的使館，並有台日兩國技術援助團，日本負責漁業，協助馬紹爾人建立冷鏈、外銷漁產；台灣則負責農業，在艱困的珊瑚礁地形教當地人怎麼養豬才不會太肥、怎麼在珊瑚礁岩上種植蔬菜。某種程度來說，也是在幫當年美國人闖下的大禍善後。
至於比基尼環礁，因為沒有活動，確實在復育當中。只是要從嚴重的核災害當中復原，確實是漫漫長路。魚會游泳，到底游到太平洋的哪裡，人們並沒有把握。不過科學家確實這裡找到一些受到輻射影響而突變的物種，還好至今為止，還沒發現哥吉拉。

Marshall Islands: a beautiful country that has been bombed 23 times
01 Nov 2019, 00:08 by Tanaka Kenji


What we want you to know is that the Marshall Islands are in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The largest atoll is the Guagarin Atoll, which is also the largest atoll in the world. However, the sovereignty of the Guagarin Atoll belongs to the Republic of the Marshall Islands, but the rule of law remains the United States. This story is a long story, starting from the beginning of World War II.



Looking down from the plane, the Marshall Islands are one after another. The narrow coral reef islands surround the lagoon, and occasionally there are islands caused by terrain breaks. Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands, is the standard atoll. The roads here are very special. The narrowest places are on the left and right sides of the sea. One side is a calm lagoon, and the other side is a rough Pacific Ocean. The lagoon is parked with a little bit of water. It is beautiful, and it is the most in the world. Beautiful countries cannot be overemphasized.
However, the Marshall Islands are backward in economy. The excessive population is distributed in houses that are not enough to live. They have to take turns. Some people sleep during the day. Some people sleep at night. On the road in the evening, there are always people chatting on the roadside. Everyone in the community probably knows each other. Law and order is of course good; but diplomats and national technical groups are very afraid of these locals who are not closed at night, because they are clear about all who go to the gossip. In addition, the lagoon looks calm, but the locals know that there is a deadly marine Vibrio, so it is rare to see someone in the vicinity of the city, only foreigners who have just arrived will do this stupid thing.
The Marshall Islands was originally a German site, but Germany did not actively rule the territory, only as a parking point for the Qingdao fleet. After the First World War, the League of Nations handed over the Marshall Islands to Japan, where the Japanese built shrines, fished, and dispatched management officials from the Micronesia region. After the Second World War, the administration of power was handed over to the United States. The United States established military bases here and conducted nuclear tests, which brought many problems to the local area. In 1986, the Republic of the Marshall Islands officially separated from the United States.
The Marshall Islands are located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and the largest atoll is the Guagarin Atoll, the largest atoll in the world. However, the sovereignty of the Guagarin Atoll belongs to the Republic of the Marshall Islands, but the rule of law remains the United States. This story is long-lived. In December 1943, after the US military successively captured the Tarawa and Makin Island under the jurisdiction of Giribati, it immediately pointed to the world's largest atoll, Guaglin. Because the Guagarin Atoll has a vast lagoon that can be used to park an aircraft carrier, once it is captured by the US military, Japan’s “absolute defense circle” will not be guaranteed, so the Japanese army will gradually strengthen its adherence.
The islands of the atoll are actually not called ""islands"". They are just a combination of many reefs, and the altitude is often less than one or two meters. The incoming Japanese commander Akiyama Gate made a plan to imitate the settlement of other islands and build a bunker on the Guagarin atoll. However, due to the terrain, as long as the trench is dug down a metre, the seawater will come out and almost all the shelters will not be built.
On February 2, 1944, the two armies officially opened in the Guagarin Atoll. Although it is related to the fall of the absolute defense circle, it is not in the absolute defense circle of Japan. At this time in Japan, in order to cope with the smashing of the left and right fronts, there is really no ability to use troops to support the fighting in Guajialin. Qiushan asked the teams to stick to it, but in three days, the atolls of Guajialin and the Marshall Islands immediately fell. Akiyama was also killed by US artillery shells on the first day of the war.
After the attack on the Guagarin Atoll, the US military never left it again. Since the 1960s, the US military has established a missile test site here, and the former residents of Guagalin have been moved to other islands. Instead, the United States gives the Marshall Islands $18 million a year each year to the Marshall Islands. It must be earmarked for compensation in Guajialin. The money is still paid by the United States until independence, but it does not seem to reach the residents. Today's Guagarin Atoll is still a US military base. The US military is building a house and swimming pool here. It is said to have a tropical atmosphere, and there are quite a few economic conditions behind it. But here is the colony's territory. Even if the US military visa is not obtained, even the Marshallese cannot enter Guaglin.

The tragedy of the Marshall Islands certainly does not stop there. Since 1946, the United States has chosen a bikini atoll in another part of the Marshall Islands as a nuclear test site. Since the first Operation Crossroads, the United States has performed 67 nuclear test explosions in the Pacific Ocean, and Bikini Atoll has accounted for 23 of them. Because the nuclear test explosion itself is too strong, in the same year, the two-section swimwear launched in Paris, France, took the bikini as the name, meaning that the sexy swimsuit will also be as shocking as the nuclear bomb.
Not many people have heard about 167 residents on the Bikini Atoll. Of course, the US military has moved them through various methods. They lost their homes and did not get good care until the US government finally allowed them to migrate to other islands that are more suitable for living under the pressure of public opinion, and accepted the US military's large amount of meat, sugar and canned aid, resulting in serious "" The problem of ""three highs"", these storms have also been burned for a long time.
But at least it was considered to be taken care of. In the vicinity of the Bikini Atoll, some people did not receive the warnings and care they deserved, but they fell because the scientists did not calculate the wind. In 1954, the United States had an accident at the nuclear test here. Of course, before the nuclear test, the US military had already painted a restricted area of 14,600 square kilometers west of the Bikini Islands, but the wind of the day was blowing to the east. Huge braided clouds rolled up countless radiant coral reefs on the atolls on the east side of the Bikini Islands, and the locals felt lazy, sullen and unprepared until the US military found it was serious. The matter was not made public, until the US military officers who did not see the past revealed to the US media on vacation, they got attention.
But the reason why this accident happened is actually related to Japan. At the time of the nuclear explosion, the Japanese fishing boat ""Fifth Fulong Pill"" was working on the east side of the Bikini Islands, and the crew suffered a lot of radiation dust pollution. On March 14, ""Five Fulong Pills"" completed the fishing mission and entered the port after the burning of the fire. The follow-up crew members were detected a large amount of radiation residues, but the catch has entered the market, causing consumers to panic. The auction of the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo was suspended, and the price of squid plummeted. The government buried the ""nuclear blasting fish"" in the corner of the market and formed the ""nuclear blasting fish countermeasures headquarters"" to measure the nuclear pollution situation in the fish market every day.
Six months later, ""Five Fulong Pills"" wireless long-lasting Baoshan Aiji died. As the only country in the world that has been attacked by large-scale nuclear attacks, Japan is extremely sensitive to nuclear pollution issues, and it has also caused many large-scale anti-American Fight. These incidents were related to the subsequent ""US-Japan Security Treaty"" and the ""Prime Three Principles"" of the Prime Minister of Sato. In addition, the famous dinosaur movie ""Gorgila"" is also an inspiration from this incident. Even when it comes to the latest ""Authentic Gogilla"", there is a sentence ""Cannot make Japan the only second in the world."" To the nuclear attacking country, such lines.
However, during the Cold War, the Japanese government needed US support, so these things ended up being lost. For example, when the Tokyo Metro Oedo Line was built in 1996, it was said that it would dig into the location of the ""nuclear blasting fish"" buried in the Tsukiji market. However, the city government finally declared that ""nothing has been dug up"", which is an urban wonder. As for the victim of the incident, ""Five Fulong Pills"" itself, because the nuclear explosion could not be re-issued, it was displayed in the Dream Island Park in Koto.
Due to public dissatisfaction, in the Marshall Islands, the United States will provide a large amount of money and material assistance every year. The United States will also ask Taiwan and Japan to share part of the support. At present, there are only embassies of the United States, Japan, and Taiwan in the Marshall Islands, and there are technical assistance groups between Taiwan and Japan. Japan is responsible for fisheries and assists Marshalls in establishing cold chains and exporting fisheries. Taiwan is responsible for agriculture and is in difficult coral reefs. The terrain teaches locals how to raise pigs so that they are not too fat and how to grow vegetables on coral reefs. To a certain extent, it is also helping the Americans to succumb to the disaster.
As for the Bikini Atoll, because there is no activity, it is indeed in reintroduction. It is really a long road to recover from a serious nuclear disaster. The fish will swim, and in the end, there is no way to swim to the Pacific Ocean. However, scientists have indeed found some species that have been affected by radiation and have been mutated. Fortunately, Gigira has not been discovered so far.
