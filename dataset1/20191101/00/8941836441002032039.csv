01 Nov 2019

SINSHEIM, Germany (AP) - Hoffenheim defeated struggling Paderborn 3-0 at home to stretch its winning run in the Bundesliga to four games on Friday.
Robert Skov opened the scoring with a free kick in the second minute and was involved in the buildup as Pavel Kaderabek made it 2-0 in the 15th. Kaderabek then set up Jürgen Locadia for the third in the 28th.
Paderborn made two changes at the break but labored to break through with Hoffenheim content to defend its lead.
