Apple Loop: New iPhone 12 Leaks, iOS 13 Update Rushed Out, Embarrassing iPhone 11 Battery Problems
01 Nov 2019 by Ewan Spence
Taking a look back at another week of news and headlines from Cupertino, this week’s Apple Loop includes the latest iPhone 12 leaks, serious power problems for the iPhone 11, a rushed iOS 13 release, Twitter’s awkward return to MacOS, the Catalina 10.15.1 update, new AirPods Pro released, Tim Cook’s photoshopping skills, Apple’s quarterly results, and where are Apple’s AirTags?Apple Loop is here to remind you of a few of the very many discussions that have happened around Apple over the last seven days (and you can read my weekly digest of Android news here on Forbes).

iPhone 12 Turns Up The 5G Power

As the Android-powered competition launch 5G handsets with the benefits of super fast connectivity, Apple’s iterative update to the iPhone 11 has been left in the slow lane. But supply chain reports suggest that 5G is coming to every iPhone 12 next year, no matter the size. I reported on the impact earlier this week:
With a projected sales target of 80 million 5G iPhones from the 2020 portfolio, that would mean every iPhone will need to carry 5G. Apple taking a different approach than that of its Android-powered rivals. Samsung’s flagship 5G handset was part of the Galaxy S10 family, but was a specific handset - the majority of S10 handsets topped out at 4G connectivity speeds. It’s a similar story with OnePlus and the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G launched this summer.

Your iPhone 11 and iOS 13 Battery Problems

Although iOS 13 has seen a number of public releases since the September launch, it is embarrassing that the Apple cannot get on top of the high battery drain issues . Reported by countless users, the new builds of the OS (which ships by default on the iPhone 11 handsets) is chewing through battery charges. Forbes’ Gordon Kelly reports:
Meanwhile, popular YouTuber iDeviceHelp notes in his iOS 13.1.3 guide: “The one major issue with this software is battery, unfortunately” and he describes it “terrible” on both his test devices. Moreover, of the 259 comments on the video at time of publishing, almost 100 complain about iOS 13.1.3 battery drain impacting their iPhones.All of which means iOS 13 remains in a sorry state, despite four rapid-fire updates and a fifth major upgrade coming soon.
And while it is unconnected, it’s delightful that the iOS 13 code has pre-announced the release of three new iPhone Smart Battery Cases for the respective iPhone 11 handsets:
Apple has accidentally left code and images in its recently released iOS 13.2 update confirming new battery cases for the entire iPhone 11 range. This builds upon a previous error by the company after it hid the code names of these cases in iOS 13.1.While each case is fractionally different (images below) to accommodate the three sizes of iPhone 11, what’s most remarkable is Apple has not improved the hideous hunchback design it has been using for several years now (reviews aren’t great). In fact, the only change is the square-camera cutout for the range’s new cameras.

Apple Rushes Out An iOS Update For HomePod Users

Following the release of iOS 13.2 last week, Apple has released iOS 13.2.1. The reason? Applying an immediate fix for the Apple HomePod, which a small number of users reported as being bricked by the OS update. David Phelan reports:
It’s come about because some users of the HomePod smart speaker, which was released by Apple last year, have reported that updating to iOS 13.2 turned their speakers into elegantly-shaped bricks.That’s because iOS 13.2 had a section within it, specifically for HomePod users. This update is here to deliver the improvements that should have come with iOS 13.2 but which Apple pulled when issues were spotted.
More details on the update here.

Twitter’s Not Quite Sure About Catalyst

One of the big selling points of MacOS Catalina was the potential to run iPadOS apps through Mac Catalyst. One of the big wins for many was the return of a ‘native’ Twitter app to the Mac platform from Twitter. Except there’s a little bit of a twist trying to enter your password. Shaun Nichols runs with the ‘you’re typing it wrong’ line about the Tw:
Twitter says a bug in macOS 10.15.1 aka Catalina stops users of the social network's desktop Mac app from entering certain letters in account password fields.When attempting to type their passwords into the application to log in, some characters are ignored, specifically 'b', 'l', 'm', 'r', and 't'. That would make it impossible to submit passwords using those keys to sign into Twitter accounts; pass phrases can be cut'n'pasted just fine.
More at The Register, and as this may not be a unique instance, keep an eye out for other issues.

MacOS Catalina Updated to v10.15.1

This week saw Apple publicly release the first point update to MacOS Catalina. Version 10.15.1 of the desktop operating system addresses a number of bugs and introduced some new features. I took a look at the changes in the update:
Apple has rolled out the first major update to MacOS Catalina, with version 10.15.1 of the operating system. Included in the update is support for the new Emoji character set introduced previously in iOS, support for the AirPods Pro launched this week, and additional privacy controls for Siri so user requested are not shared with Apple.The update also addresses a number of bug and app issues, including search and viewing options in the Photos app, improved importing of iTunes data and various display issues in the new Music app, and resolves hidden titles in the new TV app.

Listening Through The New AirPods Pro To The Rest Of The World

With the addition of active noise cancellation and silicone tips for a better fit, Apple has announced the third generation of its wireless ear buds. Called the AirPods Pro (thus allowing them to stay on sale against last year’s AirPods 2), there’s a lot to like when the $249 units go on sale. David Phelan notes the noise cancellation feature:
This is big: active noise-cancelation is built in, so you can listen to your music in noisier environments, and at lower volumes. Perfect, then, for the daily commute even if that’s on the New York subway or the London Tube. Apple is promising much more immersive sound than before.A new Transparency Mode means that by tapping on the stem of an AirPod Pro, you can switch from noise-canceling to a mode where you can hear your own voice, and those around you while the music continues to play. In other words, none of that embarrassing shouting over your perceived loud music which nobody else can hear.

Tim Cook’s AirPods

Why won’t Tim Cook pose with the Apple AirPods? Although he tweeted some pictures following the launch, they looked suspiciously like previous PR shots where he was not wearing the wireless peripherals. 9to5’s Chaim Gartenberg has a theory:
I can only draw two possible conclusions here: either someone had to photoshop an AirPod into Tim’s ear for the second picture, or someone had to photoshop an AirPod out of Tim’s ear for the first one
Which leads to a question. Why will Tim Cook not be seen wearing AirPods? Sean Hollister finds more evidence and some suppositions:
What does it mean that, thrice now, the leader of the world’s most powerful tech company couldn’t be bothered to actually stick these gadgets in his ears for a photo op? I’m not going to begin to answer that, because it’s more fun to let you imagine, and definitely not because the actual answer is probably something obvious like “his time is too valuable to run his own Twitter account,” or “Apple is deathly afraid someone will snap a photo at the precise moment one of them accidentally falls out.”
The discussion continues on Twitter. And if you do get time for a selfie with the Apple CEO, hand him some Air Pods first!

Quarterly Results And iPhone Sales

Analysts have been dissecting Apple’s quarterly numbers and comparing these to the projected iPhone sales. As The Register notes, the headline numbers are relatively stark:
Apple's fiscal 2019 full-year financial numbers were out on Wednesday: $55bn profit, down seven per cent year-on-year, off $260bn in sales, down two per cent, in the 12 months to calendar September 28.
The question underlying this is the iPhone. Apple no longer breaks out the sales numbers of its key handset, but reports listening to the call noted how circumspect CEO Tim Cook was around the smartphone. Ben Lovejoy reports:
 Phone revenue was back up above 50% of total income, at $33.36B. And Tim Cook said that iPhone 11 sales were off to “a very, very good start.” But there was one clue that all was not what it seems in what Cook didn’t say.In explaining how Q4 revenue was so high, there was no mention of iPhone… Cook then carefully slipped iPhone into his next sentence, which was about expecting better things ahead.
More at 9to5Mac on the call and the analyst projections.

And Finally…

The expected release of Apple’s physical location tags is… still expected. But a closer look inside the iOS 13.2 code reveals that many of the elements are there, ready for someone to pull the digital trigger. Surely this is the perfect stocking filler for the geekerati? William Gallagher reports:
Changes within the latest iOS 13.2 release include a folder whose name appears to say that Apple will call its forthcoming tracking devices ""AirTags."" The Tile-like devices are intended to help users locate missing items using Apple's Find My app.…The fact that the folder is included in the current release of iOS 13.2 suggests that AirTags could be coming soon, but it is not proof that they will. Back in September, the usually reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believed they would be released imminently.
