福克斯報活摘器官20年噩夢 港人說如夢初醒

01 Nov 2019, 00:35

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】隨著香港民眾反極權運動的進行，港警不斷公布被民眾稱為「被自殺」的案例，一具具身體剛墜樓就散架的屍體，讓港人回想起十多年前在香港銅鑼灣看到「中共活摘法輪功學員器官」的模擬酷刑展，同時也在全球範圍引起關注。
在Facebook、Twitter上，很多人轉載了10月26日上週六，福克斯新聞台（Fox News）發表的「倖存者和受害者關於駭人聽聞的由國家政府批准的中國器官活摘」（Survivors and victims on shocking state-sanctioned organ harvesting in China）。
福克斯重量級報導了一場近20年的噩夢，就是駭人聽聞的器官活摘，中共器官移植賺的錢可堆成山。
報導說，「這是一場噩夢，被掩藏在公眾視線以外，難以證明，被銷聲匿跡近20年。」報導介紹了2019年6月由國際人權機構ETAC發起的「中國強制摘取良心犯器官問題獨立法庭」（China Tribunal）的終審裁決，並採訪了幾位證人。



最後法庭宣布：「活摘人體器官已在中國各地大規模發生多年，法輪功學員是其中一個——而且可能是主要的——人體器官來源。」法庭還認為，中國不斷發展的移植業的產值已經超過10億美元，「中共對法輪功學員和維吾爾人的反人類罪行已無可置疑地得到確認」。
中共（活摘器官）是從1990年代開始的，最初是小規模的，是從死囚犯身上「強行摘取器官」，但在2000年左右規模開始激增，關鍵原因是法輪功（被鎮壓），直到今天也沒有停止。
中國器官活摘研究中心COHRC的研究者們估計，中國器官移植手術的數量每年可能在6萬到10萬例。20年來這一數據非常驚人。
2007年的數據顯示，中國的醫院對腎臟移植手術的收費超過6.5萬美元，對肝移植的收費是13萬美元，對肺或心臟移植的收費超過15萬美元。COHRC表示，中國器官移植賺的錢可以堆成山。
「這是以十分幽默的方式，講述一個非常非常黑暗的笑話。」9月1日，美國著名影星梅麗·史翠普（Meryl Streep）在威尼斯電影節記者會上介紹她主演的新片《洗錢天堂網絡》（The Laundromat，陸譯《自助洗衣店》）時如是說。
9月7日，在第76屆威尼斯電影節上，好萊塢巨制《洗錢天堂網絡》入圍主競賽，從紐約、巴黎到巴拿馬，從大富豪家庭矛盾到離奇謀殺場景，甚至到活生生摘取人體器官交易，影片在黑色幽默中也在傳遞人類這次噩夢。
此前，美國著名動漫《衰仔樂園》（South Park，大陸譯《南方公園》、台灣譯《南方四賤客》），也用嘲諷的口吻披露了此事。
著名媒體的報導，加上法輪功學員在香港每年約5次的大遊行、每天在景點的講真相，加上由中共鎮壓法輪功的特務組織610辦公室在幕後操控的香港青關會的暴力干擾，讓全港都知道活摘器官的事，但不少港人由於太善良、由於對中共的邪惡魔鬼特性不了解，從而拒絕相信法輪功的報導。
陳小姐在香港太子站拜祭疑被警察在8·31打死的抗爭者，她對大紀元記者說，這次反送中抗爭令香港人在親身經歷後看清了中共，回頭再一看法輪功十多年不懈的呼籲，現在終於明白了，法輪功講的全是真的，《大紀元》的報導很客觀。
不少香港市民在社交媒體上留言，為自己以前對法輪功的誤解致歉。


有Facebook介紹了報導，網民留言說，以過去20年，香港人沒有理會法輪功的指證，惡法一個個到來，才知道所有不合理的事，只要和共產黨扯上關係，就會變得合理。（網絡截圖）

Fox reported a 20-year nightmare for organ harvesting. Hong Kong people said that they are waking up like a dream.

01 Nov 2019, 00:35

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 01, 2019] With the anti-totalitarian movement of the Hong Kong people, the Hong Kong police have continuously announced cases that the people have called ""suicide"", a body that has fallen from the building and has fallen apart. People recalled the simulated torture exhibition of ""the CCP's live harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners"" in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong more than a decade ago. It also attracted attention around the world.
On Facebook and Twitter, many people reprinted on Saturday, October 26, Fox News published ""Survivors and Victims on the Appalling Chinese Organs Approved by the National Government"" (Survivors and victims) On shocking state-sanctioned organ harvesting in China).
Fox heavyweight reported a nightmare of nearly 20 years, which is a horrific organ harvest, and the money earned by the CCP organ transplant can be piled up into mountains.
The report said, ""This is a nightmare. It is hidden outside the public eye. It is difficult to prove that it has been disappeared for nearly 20 years."" The report introduced the ""China's mandatory seizure of organs and organs independently initiated by the international human rights institution ETAC in June 2019. The China Tribunal's final ruling and interviewed several witnesses.



Finally, the court announced: ""The live organ harvesting has been happening on a large scale throughout China for many years. Falun Gong practitioners are one of them - and may be the main source of human organs."" The court also believes that the value of China's growing transplant industry has been With more than $1 billion, ""the CCP’s crimes against humanity against Falun Gong practitioners and Uighurs have been unquestionably confirmed.""
The CCP (live organ harvesting) began in the 1990s. It was originally small-scale. It was ""forced to pick up organs"" from death row prisoners. However, the scale began to surge around 2000, and the key reason was Falun Gong (repressed) until It has not stopped today.
Researchers at the China Organ Lives Extract Research Center COHRC estimate that the number of organ transplants in China may range from 60,000 to 100,000 per year. This data has been amazing for 20 years.
According to 2007 data, hospitals in China charge more than $65,000 for kidney transplants, $130,000 for liver transplants, and more than $150,000 for lung or heart transplants. COHRC said that the money earned by Chinese organ transplants can be piled up into mountains.
""This is a very humorous way to tell a very, very dark joke."" On September 1st, the famous American movie star Meryl Streep introduced her new film ""The Money Laundering Paradise Network"" at the Venice Film Festival press conference. (The Laundromat, the land translation ""Laundromat"") said.
On September 7th, at the 76th Venice Film Festival, the Hollywood giant ""Money Laundering Network"" was shortlisted for the main competition, from New York, Paris to Panama, from the contradiction of the rich and the rich family to the scene of bizarre murder, and even to the transaction of human organs. The film also conveys the human nightmare in black humor.
Previously, the famous American anime ""Autumn Park"" (South Park, the mainland translation ""South Park"", Taiwan translation ""Southern Four Hackers""), also revealed the matter in a mocking tone.
The reports of famous media, together with Falun Gong practitioners’ five-day parade in Hong Kong, the truth about the sights every day, and the violent interference of the Hong Kong Youth League, which was controlled by the CCP’s spoiler’s 610 office behind the scenes, let All Hong Kong knows about organ harvesting, but many Hong Kong people refuse to believe Falun Gong’s reports because they are too kind and do not understand the CCP’s evil devil.
Miss Chen was at the Prince Edward Station in Hong Kong to worship the suspects who were killed by the police at 8.31. She told the Epoch Times that the anti-delivery protest made the Hong Kong people see the CCP after their personal experience and turned back to see the Falun Gong. After more than ten years of unremitting appeal, I finally understand that Falun Gong is all true. The report of the Epoch Times is very objective.
Many Hong Kong citizens have commented on social media and apologized for their misunderstanding of Falun Gong.


Some Facebook introduced the report. Netizens said that in the past 20 years, Hong Kong people have ignored the Falun Gong testimony. When the evil laws come one by one, they know that all the unreasonable things will become reasonable as long as they are related to the Communist Party. (web screenshot)
