Topline: Apple entered the streaming wars with much fanfare on Friday, announcing the launch of Apple TV+ as the first “all-original” streaming service, with a slate of high-budget new shows that it hopes can compete with rivals like Amazon, Netflix and Disney.

Apple TV+ launched in over 100 countries and territories on Friday, debuting four new TV series and several other offerings, with new programming to be added each month.
At $4.99 per month, Apple has deliberately priced its service cheaper than other competitors—and anyone who purchased an Apple product after September 10 can get a free one-year subscription.
With its early bet on a few original series, Apple is relying on big star power to attract subscribers: One of its most heavily promoted programs, The Morning Show, stars Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell.
Other content released on Friday includes: For All Mankind, a science fiction drama imagining a world in which the Soviet Union wins the space race; See, a drama set in a dystopian future starring Jason Momoa; and Dickinson, a reimagining of poet Emily Dickinson in her teenage years.
Apple TV+’s lack of library content might put it at a disadvantage, however: Unlike Netflix and the upcoming Disney+, Apple doesn’t have rights to a back catalog of TV shows and movies, making Apple TV+’s offerings slimmer than other online streaming  services.
Apple will need to maximize its original content in order to compete with the wide offerings of rival services like HBO Max—which has rights to classics like Friends and South Park but also new spinoffs like the Game of Thrones prequel, House of the Dragon—and Disney+, with its vast library of popular franchises like Star Wars, Marvel and new spinoffs like The Mandalorian.

Tangent: A recent study of the new streaming landscape found that after Disney+ (88%), Apple TV+ had the highest levels of consumer awareness (63%), followed by HBO Max (37%)—slated for release in Spring 2020, and NBCU’s Peacock (28%)—releasing in April 2020.
Big number: In a recent note, Morgan Stanley analysts see big potential for Apple TV+, estimating that it could generate $9 billion per year in revenue by 2025—and that’s if just one out of every ten Apple users subscribes to the new service.
Crucial quote: “It’s a gift to our users and, from a business point of view, we’re really proud of the content,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said after the company’s third-quarter earnings report on Wednesday. “We’d like as many people as possible to view it. This allows us to focus on maximizing subscribers, particularly in the early going. We think it’s a bold move.”
