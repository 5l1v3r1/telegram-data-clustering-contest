Unexpected Friday Surprise: Marley Natural Bubbler

I’ve never owned a bubbler. Sure I’ve smoked from them a couple times, ok so maybe that’s not entirely true about owning one. I’ve gazed at them on the interwebs and in “head” shops, I did smoke a Marley Natural Bubbler out on the coast and it made quite an impression on me. They are not inexpensive tools, but the best smoking accoutrement rarely are. Simple devices such as the Marley Natural Bubbler make their way into my life and charm me and my lungs. It’s not as overt as a bong, nor as incongruous as a pipe, a bubbler is something in between. This one is handsome in the hand and on the table. It holds water, sort of like a bong, but it also is very efficient with just air as the guide. It’s not too large, not too small but it’s just right in my hand.
My Marley Natural Bubbler is, as a metaphor, easy on my lungs and it gets me really stoned.
A win/win!
