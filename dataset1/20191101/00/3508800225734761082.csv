為中產階級奮戰到底（上）：從不服輸的華倫，能讓美國再次偉大嗎？
01 Nov 2019, 00:08 by 《思想坦克》


我們想讓你知道的是身為越來越有望代表民主黨挑戰川普連任的候選人，華倫到底有什麼改造美國社會的藍圖？基於她多年的實證研究和接觸廣大美國基層中產階級民眾的經驗，她認為當下的美國資本主義過度保護以華爾街為主的大公司，扼殺了公平競爭與讓所得平均分配的機會。



文：趙君朔（有個雲霄飛車式的人生，曾很輕鬆的進了不太好進的美國學校博士班，以為自己會是華文社會科學界的明日之星，又因為一個烏龍，更「輕鬆」的被踢出來，開始闖盪亞洲江湖，到處求人下單，到目前為止的心得是「我32歲以前到底活了什麼？」）
「不論是在80、90年代初期的經濟不景氣、中間的復甦期或是之後的時間，美國家庭收入的中位數，即使考量了通膨，依然原地踏步。」
「所謂的次級借貸（subprime lending），也就是借錢給信用記錄有問題或是債台高築的人，是消費者金融業務中最賺錢也成長最快的部門。」
這兩段引文看起來像是當下探討全球性政治經濟危機之根源的文章中常會出現的敘述。第一段更很容易被誤認為是引用了專研所得分配的兩大法國籍名經濟學家皮凱提（Thomas Piketty）和賽斯（Emmanuel Saez）的研究成果。然而這其實是引自一本2000年就出版的學術著作《脆弱的中產階級》（The Fragile Middle Class），作者是當時還很年輕的三位法學教授，其中一位，就是現在在民主黨總統初選中聲勢扶搖直上的參議員、前哈佛大學法學教授華倫（Elizabeth Warren）。
從這兩段引文便可看出，華倫對於美國社會面臨的問題早已著力甚深，而且是基於紮實、嚴謹的實證研究。這本《脆弱的中產階級》是奠基於美國15個地區法院的申請破產人提供的資料，並輔以統計分析所完成的著作。
在2003年，華倫又和她當時在知名的麥肯錫公司工作的女兒，運用麥肯錫擁有的大量商業數據和美國政府部門的統計資料，合寫了影響力更大的《The Two -Income Trap :Why Middle-Class Parents Are (still) Going Broke》。書中精彩的揭露了為了要讓子女能到有好學校的學區就讀，美國的一般家庭夫妻倆人都開始擁有全職的工作，收入才能用來繳交不斷高漲的房貸與其他生活開支，從而處於因為各種意外（如被裁員、離婚、忽然生重病無法負擔醫藥費、房價大跌使資產變負債等）的打擊而破產的風險中。
華倫在學術生涯中具體而發人深省的研究讓她開始受到矚目，受邀進入政府部門擔任各式各樣的諮詢或是行政工作。先是擔任國會重審破產法委員會的資深顧問、接著在金融風暴後參加國會的紓困監督五人小組，負責監督財政部「問題資產救助計畫」的實施。之後擔任她自己倡議成立的財政部消費者金融保護局的「特別顧問」兼「總統助理」（因為華爾街強烈反對她出任首任局長）。
在這個機構任職的出色表現讓總統歐巴馬（Barack Obama）鼓勵她出馬競選聯邦參議員，她也不負眾望的初試啼聲就跌破眾人眼鏡，靠破紀錄的小額捐款打敗了實力堅強的現任共和黨對手布朗（Scott Brown）。然而更重要的是，華倫在競選過程中更廣泛的接觸到了處於危機中的廣大美國中產階級，對於要如何幫助他們從不斷下滑的困境中掙脫出來也有了更多的洞見，在參議員任上開始積極推動各式反擊大公司的立法。最終決定挑戰2020美國總統的大位，矢志要全面改變問題重重的美式資本主義和失落的美國社會。
而面對執政風格特異但也廣受民眾支持的川普（Donald Trump），可以說是完全站在對立面的華倫究竟有沒有機會一博，成為美國歷史上第一位入主白宮的女總統呢？以下會從華倫不凡的成長歷程與職業生涯、人格特質還有她具體而廣泛的選舉政見來做一些分析、預測。

華倫生長於算是美國偏鄉的奧克拉荷馬州的一個小城，原來小康的家境在父親忽然生病無法保有原來穩定工作後便陷入捉襟見肘的困境，母親被迫以中高齡家庭主婦的身分重新出外求職，但青少年的華倫似乎已經隱約感到自己不會是一個鄉下小城的平凡女孩。
她在自傳中寫到「……我不漂亮，不是全校最好的學生；不擅長運動，不會唱歌，也不會彈奏任何樂器。但是我有一個強項，我很能戰，不是用拳頭，而是唇槍舌劍。我是學校辯論隊的主將。」她在母親反對下，自力申請到獎學金前往喬治・華盛頓大學就讀。然而才讀完大一，華倫高中辯論隊的學長吉姆（Jim Warren）便和她求婚，讓她提早結束了大學生涯，開始了相夫教子的家庭生活。
在華倫的第一個女兒開始上幼稚園後，覺得家庭主婦的生涯似乎不能滿足她（她在家庭生活中的心有旁騖讓她數次差一點燒掉廚房、還讓全家兩次食物中毒），於是誤打誤撞的進了羅格斯大學法學院就讀。隨後因為先生工作調派的緣故，舉家遷往休士頓。在休士頓大學開始兼任教職，處於工作、照顧兩個幼子的兩頭燒生活讓先生失望離去。但她自己的職業生涯，卻在意外接下教授「破產法」這門課後開始有了戲劇性的轉變，同時也主動追求在學校研討會認識的另一位年輕法學助理教授曼恩（Bruce Mann），走入另一段婚姻。
在教授破產法的時候，這領域的世界級大師，提供不少意見給國會修法的里森費爾德（Stefan Riesenfeld）正好到該校訪問，於是華倫請他到課堂上來講幾句話。但華倫卻意外的發現，對於到底是什麼人會陷入申請破產的困境，里森費爾德教授有的只是想當然爾的成見：他認為只有一生都不懂得做選擇的經濟弱勢族群，例如從事臨時工或是幫佣的群體才會淪落到破產法庭。
華倫追問他為什麼他知道是經濟弱勢族群，而且會窮上一輩子，里森費爾德的回答更讓她傻眼。他只是說「喔！這沒有什麼好講的，反正大家都知道！」之後還加上一句「嗯！每個『專家』都知道！」
但一向不服輸的華倫當然不可能善罷甘休，前面一開始就提到的著作就是為了回應這位破產法權威的輕蔑。華倫和另外兩位法學新秀透過對實際破產案例的解讀發現，從一些關鍵的資訊如教育程度和職業來看，處於破產中的人是貨真價實的中產階級。而他們之所以會落入此境地，和美國正在發生的經濟、社會變遷與高度偏袒大銀行的種種法律有關。
這個歷經長時間完成的深入研究，讓華倫對美國社會的危機比其他鑽研抽象社會科學理論的學者有更早也更深刻的認識，也讓她開始和實際政治發生接觸。而最重要的，就是從這短短對她前半生的敘述，已經可以看出：華倫是個面對逆境或是權威從不退縮，而且正如她自己所言，很能全力以赴戰到底的意志堅強女性。
之後華倫因為在國會紓困監督小組的優秀表現，讓她和美國聯邦存款保險公司主席貝爾（Shelia Bair）還有美國證券交易委員會主席沙皮諾（Mary Shapiro）三人，一起成為2010年5月24號出刊的《時代雜誌》專題「華爾街新警長」的封面人物。

現在因為主要對手前副總統拜登（Joe Biden）之子陷入通烏門的貪腐醜聞，領先的幅度已經被華倫大幅拉近（目前各種全國性民調拜登和華倫的平均支持率分別為25％和24％）。另一位對手桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）因為健康問題和過於左傾的政綱而脫離領先群，身為越來越有望代表民主黨挑戰川普連任的候選人，華倫到底有什麼改造美國社會的藍圖？
對華倫來說，基於她多年的實證研究和接觸廣大美國基層中產階級民眾的經驗，她認為當下的美國資本主義過度保護以華爾街為主的大公司或是科技公司，扼殺了公平競爭與讓所得平均分配的機會。因此她提出一連串的具體措施要來改革這些弊病：

對公司帳目（而非法律上可扣稅的）所有超過1億美金的利潤額外課徵7％的稅。
對最富有的2％家庭課徵稅率15％的稅，來添補社會安全支付的潛在赤字。
對資產淨值超過5000萬美金的富人，加徵每年2％的財產稅、淨值超過1億美金的稅率為3％。
推出相當於公有化健康保險（Medicare for All）計畫。
強化她當參議員時推動通過的《停止華爾街掠奪法案》：目前私募基金員工收入的資本利得與投資稅的稅率是23.8％，華倫打算將稅率提升到37％。此外投資於私募基金的合夥人往後在併購公司時，需要為這些公司的現有負債和退休金儲備負責。
重建Glass-Stegall法案中的防火牆：讓銀行吸引存款與從事風險投資的部門分離。
取消現有大型併購：拜耳需要把孟山都賣掉、臉書必須放掉Instagram和Whatsapp。
網購平台全球收益超過250億美金的公司會被以「公用事業平台」的名義監管、之後無法在平台上銷售自己的產品或服務。Google必須售出自己的線上廣告業務、亞馬遜將無法在網站自行銷售產品。

以上所述都是會對目前美國經濟運行產生重大衝擊的新政策，也難怪《經濟學人》雜誌認為如果大部分華倫的構想真的付諸實行，就好比是當年小羅斯福（Franklin D. Roosevelt）的新政（New Deal）。
除了這些針對富人與大企業的措施外，如何讓勞工與一般中產階級從美國看似良好的經濟成長中一樣受益並推動綠能經濟，扭轉惡化的所得分配，以及說明華倫在外交政策上的理念和具體主張是什麼，還有所有這些政策綜合起來和川普的主張有什麼差別，是否能改變美國的經濟與社會，讓美國真正再次偉大，就是下一篇文章所要探討的主題。

Fighting for the middle class (top): Will Warren, who never accepts defeat, make the United States great again?
01 Nov 2019, 00:08 by ""Think Tank""


What we want you to know is that as a candidate who is increasingly expected to represent the Democratic Party to challenge Trump's re-election, what kind of blueprint does Warren have to transform American society? Based on her years of empirical research and experience with the majority of the US middle-class people, she believes that the current American capitalism overprotects large Wall Street-based companies, stifling the opportunity for fair competition and equal distribution of income.



Text: Zhao Junyi (There is a cloud-like life. I have easily entered a doctoral class in an American school that is not so good. I think I will be the star of tomorrow in the Chinese social sciences, and because of an oolong, it is more relaxed. I was kicked out and started to wander through the Asian rivers and lakes. I asked people to place orders everywhere. The experience so far is ""What did I live before I was 32?"")
""Whether in the economic downturn in the early 1980s and early 1990s, during the middle recovery period, or after, the median household income in the United States, even after considering inflation, is still in place.""
""The so-called subprime lending, which means lending money to people with problems with credit records or high debts, is the most profitable and fastest-growing sector in consumer finance.""
These two citations look like the narratives that often appear in the current article exploring the roots of the global political and economic crisis. The first paragraph is more likely to be mistaken for the research results of the two French nationals economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez. However, this is actually quoted from a published academic book, The Fragile Middle Class, published in 2000. The author was a very young three law professor at the time, one of whom is now the Democratic president. The senator, the senator, and former Harvard law professor Elizabeth Warren.
It can be seen from these two quotations that Warren has already been deeply concerned about the problems facing the American society, and is based on solid and rigorous empirical research. This ""fragile middle class"" is based on the information provided by the bankrupts of the 15 district courts in the United States, supplemented by the work done by statistical analysis.
In 2003, Warren and her daughter, who was working at the well-known McKinsey Company, used the large amount of business data owned by McKinsey and the statistics of the US government to co-author the more influential ""The Two -Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Parents Are (still) Going Broke. The book reveals that in order to allow children to attend a school district with a good school, the average family couple in the United States has begun to have full-time jobs, and the income can be used to pay for the rising mortgage and other living expenses. Because of various types of accidents (such as being laid off, divorced, suddenly serious illness can not afford medical expenses, housing prices fell, making assets become liabilities), the risk of bankruptcy.
Warn’s specific and thought-provoking research in her academic career has made her start to be noticed and invited to government departments for a variety of consulting or administrative tasks. First, he served as a senior adviser to the Congressional Review of the Bankruptcy Law Commission, and then participated in the Congressional Debt Supervision Five Team after the financial turmoil, responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Treasury’s “Problem Asset Relief Program”. Later, she served as the ""Special Advisor"" and ""President Assistant"" of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, which she advocated (because Wall Street strongly opposed her appointment as the first director).
The outstanding performance of this agency allowed President Barack Obama to encourage her to run for the Senate. She did not lose sight of the public test and fell below the crowds. She broke the strong incumbent republic with a record-breaking small donation. Party opponent Brown (Scott Brown). More importantly, however, Warren has been more exposed to the mid-crisis American middle class during the campaign and has more insights on how to help them break free from the declining dilemma. At the beginning, we actively promoted various kinds of legislation to counter large companies. In the end, he decided to challenge the 2020 President of the United States and is determined to comprehensively change the problematic American capitalism and the lost American society.
In the face of ruling style-specific but also widely supported by the public, Donald Trump can be said that Warren, who is completely opposite, has a chance to become the first female president in the history of the White House. What? The following will do some analysis and prediction from Warren's extraordinary growth process and career, personality traits and her specific and extensive electoral politics.

Warren grew up in a small town in Oklahoma, a country away from the United States. The original well-off family was in a difficult situation after his father suddenly became ill and could not retain the original stable work. The mother was forced to return to work as a middle-aged housewife. But the youth of Warren seems to have vaguely felt that she would not be an ordinary girl in a small country town.
In her autobiography, she wrote, ""...I am not beautiful, not the best student in the school; I am not good at sports, I can't sing, I can't play any instruments. But I have a strength, I can fight, not with fists. It is a slap in the face. I am the master of the school debate team."" Under the opposition of her mother, she applied for a scholarship to go to George Washington University. However, after finishing her freshman year, Jim Warren, the senior of the Warren High School Debate Team, proposed to marry her, let her end her college career early, and began her family life.
After Warren’s first daughter started kindergarten, she felt that the housewife’s career seemed to be unable to satisfy her (she had a side in her family life that made her almost burn the kitchen several times and poisoned the whole family twice). So, he entered the Rutgers Law School with a mistake. Later, because of the work of the husband, the family moved to Houston. At the University of Houston, he began to serve as a faculty member. He was working and taking care of the two young children. However, her own career, after the accidentally taking the course of teaching the ""Bankruptcy Law"" began a dramatic change, but also actively pursued another young law assistant professor Bruce Mann who met at the school seminar. Go into another marriage.
When teaching the bankruptcy law, world-class masters in this field provided Stefan Riesenfeld, who provided a lot of advice to Congress, to visit the school, so Warren asked him to speak a few words in class. However, Warren unexpectedly discovered that for what kind of people would fall into the predicament of filing for bankruptcy, Professor Rissenfeld only had the prejudice of taking it for granted: he believed that only economically disadvantaged groups who did not know how to choose in their lifetime, such as Groups engaged in temporary workers or domestic help will fall into bankruptcy courts.
Warren asked him why he knew that he was an economically disadvantaged group and would be poor for a lifetime. Risenfeld’s answer made her dumbfounded. He just said, ""Hey! This is nothing to say, everyone knows it anyway!"" Then added a sentence ""Well! Every ""expert"" knows!""
But Warren, who has always refused to admit defeat, certainly can't give up. The work mentioned in the beginning is to respond to the contempt of the bankruptcy authority. Warren and two other law rookies found through the interpretation of the actual bankruptcy case that from the perspective of some key information such as education and career, the bankrupt person is a genuine middle class. And the reason why they fall into this situation is related to the economic and social changes that are taking place in the United States and the laws that are highly biased towards large banks.
This in-depth study, which has been completed for a long time, has made Warren’s crisis in American society earlier and deeper than other scholars who have studied abstract social science theory, and has also begun to make contact with actual politics. The most important thing is that from this short narrative to her first half of life, it can be seen that Warren is a face of adversity or authority never shrinks, and as she said, she can go all out to fight to the end. Strong-willed women.
After Warren’s excellent performance in the Congress, she and the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chairman Shelia Bair and US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Shapiro became together in 2010. On the cover of the magazine ""Time Magazine"" on the 24th of the month, ""The New Sheriff of Wall Street"".

Now because the main opponent's former vice president Joe Biden's son has fallen into Tongwumen's corruption scandal, the lead has been greatly narrowed by Warren (the current national polls Biden and Warren's average support rate respectively) 25% and 24%). Another rival, Bernie Sanders, left the lead group because of health problems and a too left-leaning platform. As a candidate who is increasingly expected to represent the Democratic Party in re-electing Trump, what kind of transformation does Warren have in American society? blueprint?
For Warren, based on her years of empirical research and experience with the majority of the US middle-class people, she believes that the current American capitalism overprotects large companies or technology companies dominated by Wall Street, stifling fair competition and letting The resulting average distribution opportunity. So she proposed a series of specific measures to reform these ills:

A tax of 7% is imposed on all profits of the company's accounts (not legally tax deductible) in excess of $100 million.
A tax of 15% on the richest 2% of households is taxed to add to the potential deficit of social security payments.
For wealthy individuals with a net worth of more than $50 million, a 2% annual property tax and a net value of more than $100 million are imposed on the tax rate of 3%.
Launched the equivalent of the Medicare for All program.
Strengthening the ""Stop the Wall Street Plunder Act"" that she promoted when she was a senator: At present, the capital gains and investment tax rates of private equity employees' income are 23.8%, and Warren intends to raise the tax rate to 37%. In addition, partners investing in private equity funds are responsible for the existing liabilities and pension reserves of these companies when they subsequently acquire companies.
Rebuilding the firewall in the Glass-Stegall Act: Separating banks from deposits with ventures.
Cancel existing large-scale mergers and acquisitions: Bayer needs to sell Monsanto, Facebook must let go of Instagram and Whatsapp.
Companies with an online shopping platform with a global revenue of more than $25 billion will be regulated under the name of a “utility platform” and will not be able to sell their products or services on the platform. Google must sell its online advertising business, and Amazon will not be able to sell its products on the site itself.

All of the above are new policies that will have a major impact on the current US economic operation. It is no wonder that The Economist magazine believes that if most of Warren’s ideas are really implemented, it would be like Franklin D. Roosevelt) New Deal.
In addition to these measures for the rich and the big companies, how to make labor and the general middle class benefit from the seemingly good economic growth of the United States and promote the green energy economy, reverse the deteriorating income distribution, and explain Warren’s foreign policy. What are the ideas and specific claims, and how all these policies are combined with Trump’s claims, whether it can change the US economy and society, and make the United States truly great again, is the subject of the next article.
