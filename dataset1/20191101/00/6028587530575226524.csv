Chinese Shoppers Will Boycott American Brands During Singles’ Day, The World’s Largest Online Shopping Event

Topline: Almost 80% of Chinese shoppers said in a new survey that they will boycott American goods during Singles’ Day—the world’s largest online shopping event—on November 11, as the ongoing U.S.-China trade war increasingly gives rise to nationalistic sentiment that is trickling into the retail industry.

Up to 78% of Chinese shoppers said they would avoid buying American brands and instead opt for Chinese products, according to a recent survey from global consulting firm AlixPartners that was first reported on by the South China Morning Post.
More than half of the 2,000 respondents cited “patriotism” as the main reason for doing so, according to AlixPartners’ survey, showing a rise in nationalistic attitudes amid the backdrop of the U.S.-China trade war.
Singles’ Day, or Double 11, is a 24-hour online shopping festival on Alibaba’s Taobao, Tmall and AliExpress platforms; it is the biggest e-commerce event in the world, larger than Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined.
If shoppers do boycott American goods as expected, that would primarily hurt U.S. consumer brands like Nike, Tapestry Inc., Ralph Lauren, Capri Holdings and Tiffany & Co.
While most respondents said they would pass up American brands, they won’t be discouraged from choosing other foreign brands from places like Europe, Japan and South Korea, according to the survey.
Despite the effects of the trade war, Chinese consumers in big cities are expected to spend 54% more year-over-year on Singles’ Day, according to the survey.

Big numbers: In 2018, Black Friday sales amounted to $6.2 billion, Cyber Monday sales hit $7.9 billion and shoppers spent roughly $4.2 billion on Amazon Prime Day—but none of those come close to the $30.8 billion of transactions (in gross merchandise volume) spent on Alibaba’s Singles’ Day last year.
Crucial quote: “Chinese consumers … prefer local brands, and the recent rise in pro-China feeling has only pushed this further,” AlixPartners’ director Jason Ong said in the South China Morning Post.
