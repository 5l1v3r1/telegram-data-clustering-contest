MADISON, Wis. - Although Thursday was covered in snow and teeming with trick-or-treaters, a Madison radio station was already in the holiday spirit. 



WMHX MIX 105.1 announced on its website and social media Thursday that it has made the seasonal change to ""play Christmas music all the time"" on Halloween. 
On its Twitter account, 105.1 said the reason for the Oct. 31 switch is because the ""snow has got us in the Christmas spirit."" 
Last year, the station switched to holiday music on Nov. 15.
