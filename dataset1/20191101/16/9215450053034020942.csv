按揭借8成定9成好？上車族一間變兩間好機會｜1%Anthony
01 Nov 2019, 16:16 by 1% Anthony
實戰個案，真人真事！朋友上車，儲了2成首期，買了一個近600萬的單位，剛簽了臨約，還未申請按揭，突然林鄭《施政報告》宣佈，800萬以下都可以做9成按揭，朋友問借唔借9成好…

做8成定9成按揭？
朋友： 銀行話我可以申請9成…筆者： 發達啦！朋友： 我諗緊借唔借，定照舊借8成好？筆者： 有得借，點解唔借呢？朋友： 俾多啲首期，供少啲嘛！筆者： 留番啲錢投資，賺得仲多喎！
一般人看到…借多咗，供款多咗，跌一成就變負資產！投資者看到…天掉下來的投資創富機會！上述例子，朋友儲了2成首期…原本要用盡資金，600萬 X 20% = 120 萬元，最新可少付一半，600萬 X 10% = 60 萬元。
當然有代價，月供多了，問題是…供多幾多？以按息2.475%，供30年期計算…原本2成首期，月供18,903元，最新1成首期，月供21,266元，即是每月多付2,363元。頭幾年，供款約一半是本金，即每月實質多付約1,200元，如何抉擇？你要問問自己…60萬在你手，可以每個月多賺1,200元嗎？

用首期再投資
進取派，家人齊心，香港一間變兩間！如果你家裡仍然有人未上車，例如兄弟姐妹，而他又有貸款能力，可以運用這筆資金再買多一間，一家人齊齊又住又賺！保守派就保本為上，賺息差！如果乜都唔做，只放在Mortgage Link戶口，每年收取利息也接近15,000元，沒有損失，萬一失業可以有錢供樓。又或者你可以投資一些保本投資產品，例如保本基金、債券、高息藍籌股等，假如每年回報有5%，就淨賺2.5%！
穩中求勝派就買多間大陸樓，零成本鋸大樹！朋友沒有親人屬首置，見我們買大陸樓買得不亦樂乎，也想參與…例如筆者最近在大灣區某三線城市核心區買的單位，1,000呎才60萬，就當Full Pay唔再借，減低風險，亦可收租2,000元，扣除雜費也可抵銷利息成本有餘。重點是我們發掘的這個地方，現時呎價才500多元，幾年後輕輕升上1,000多元已經賺一倍。
如果供款能力夠，另一個筆者與學員們非常喜歡的某二線城市，1,000呎才140萬，可以借7成按揭，首期約50萬，呎價升3成已經賺一倍，以這個城市的發展，升5、6成不難，賺兩倍了！別忘記還有一層香港樓，兩間一齊升，威力多大！新政策是天掉下來的創富機會！別跟凡人一樣，只看到…借多咗，供多咗，更易負資產~~要有投資者的眼光，看到創富機會！只要衡量好風險就行~~

Mortgage borrowed 80% to be good? One of the two races has changed into a good opportunity | 1% Anthony
01 Nov 2019, 16:16 by 1% Anthony
Actual cases, real people! My friend got on the bus and saved 20% of the first period. I bought a unit of nearly 6 million. I just signed a contract and I have not applied for a mortgage. Suddenly, Lin Zheng’s Policy Address announced that it can make a 90% mortgage under 8 million. Friends asked to borrow 90% good...

Do 80% fixed 90% mortgage?
Friend: I can apply for 90% of the bank... Author: Developed! Friend: I am borrowing from the loan, and I am borrowing 80% from the old one? Author: I have to borrow, what is the solution? Friend: Many of the first period, for the younger! Author: Leave a lot of money to invest, earn a lot of money!
The average person sees... borrowing more, making more contributions, falling one achievement and becoming a negative asset! Investors see... the investment that has fallen in the sky to create wealth! In the above example, the friend saved 20% of the first period... originally had to use up the funds, 6 million X 20% = 1.2 million yuan, the latest can be paid less than half, 6 million X 10% = 600,000 yuan.
Of course, there is a price. The monthly supply is much. The question is... how many more? The interest rate is 2.475% for 30 years... The original is 20% for the first period, and the monthly fee is 18,903 yuan. The latest one is for the first period, and the monthly fee is 21,266 yuan, which is 2,363 yuan per month. In the first few years, about half of the contributions were principal, that is, the actual overpayment of about 1,200 yuan per month. How to choose? You have to ask yourself... 600,000 in your hand, can you earn 1,200 yuan per month?

Reinvest in the first phase
Enterprising, family, and Hong Kong, two rooms! If someone in your family still doesn't get on the bus, such as a brother or sister, and he has the ability to borrow, you can use this money to buy another one. The family will live together and earn! Conservatives are guaranteed to save money and earn interest margins! If you do it all, you only put it in the Mortgage Link account, and the annual interest rate is close to 15,000 yuan. There is no loss. If you are unemployed, you can have money to pay for the building. Or you can invest in some capital-guaranteed investment products, such as capital preservation funds, bonds, high-interest blue-chip stocks, etc. If the annual return is 5%, you will earn a net profit of 2.5%!
Stabilize the winning party and buy more mainland buildings, zero-cost saw trees! Friends don't have relatives for the first time. Seeing that we bought the mainland building, I bought it. I also want to participate... For example, the author recently bought a unit in the core area of a third-tier city in Dawan District, only 1,000 yuan, only 600,000, just as Full Pay唔By borrowing, the risk can be reduced by 2,000 yuan, and the cost of interest can be offset by the miscellaneous fees. The focus is on the place we have explored. The current price is only 500 yuan. After a few years, it has doubled up to 1,000 yuan.
If the contribution capacity is enough, another second-tier city that the author and the students like very much, only 1.4 million in 1,000 baht, can borrow 70% mortgage, the first period is about 500,000, and the price of 呎 has increased by 30%. The development of the city, rising 5, 6 percent is not difficult, earning twice! Don't forget that there is still a layer of Hong Kong building, the two are rising together, how powerful! The new policy is the opportunity to create wealth! Don't just like mortals, just see... borrow more, for more, and more negative assets~~ Have investors' eyes and see opportunities to create wealth! Just measure the risk and you can do it~~
