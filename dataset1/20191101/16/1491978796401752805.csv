Human rights in the tobacco fields of Malawi – in pictures

Photographer David Levene visited Malawi with Sarah Boseley, to document the impact of the tobacco industry on the wellbeing of the local farming communities whose livelihood depends on it. Human rights lawyers Leigh Day are working with Malawian translators and paralegals interviewing potential clients to join the watershed legal action against British American Tobacco


BAT faces landmark legal case over Malawi families’ poverty wages


The children labouring in Malawi’s fields for British American Tobacco





On this farm estate we found a shack where 16 contract-farming families were living together in cramped conditions. Some of them were confined to very small spaces on wooden bunks with different families sleeping in close proximity to one another

A boy, 8, stands next to a trunk from a Jenga tree which is being used as a supporting pole for tobacco drying sheds. A farmer told us that in order to get the right wood for poles to support tobacco drying sheds, the farmers would walk for three-and-a-half hours to the top of the mountains (in the distance in the photograph) which is the last place where this particular type of tree still grows. The wood is tough and perfect for the job. They would spend all day cutting one tree down and then walk back again while carrying the trunk

The young plants need to be watered twice a day with 12 to 20 cans for every strip of planting

Martyn Day speaks to some of the community with human rights lawyer Liberty Bridge. Leigh Day’s lawyers are seeking compensation for more than 350 child labourers and their parents in the high court in London

Many people come to listen find out if they can be part of the legal action. Leigh Day says they anticipate the number of child labourer claimants to rise to as high as 15,000

Martyn Day talks to people in a school. Day, a founding partner and head of Leigh Day said: ‘If it hadn’t been for the Guardian, this case would not be happening’

While BAT claims it has told farmers not to use their children as unpaid labour, the lawyers say the families cannot afford to work their fields otherwise, because they receive so little money for their crop – and so have no choice

At the end of the day coming back into Mzuzu we saw a night market where people light up their stalls with their phones. It is a two-hour journey from here to the fields
