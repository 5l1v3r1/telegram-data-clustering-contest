M√∏tet som ble en vekker for Bendtner: ‚Äì Jeg begynte √• gr√•te
Nicklas Bendtner er aktuell med ny bok. N√• forteller han √•penhjertig om da han som unggutt holdt p√• √• bli kastet ut av Arsenal-akademiet.

Den danske spissen kom til Arsenal allerede som 16-√•ring. Han hadde utvilsomt et stort talent for fotball, men mentaliteten holdt p√• √• sette en stopper for den tidligere Rosenborg-spilleren. Det forteller han √•penhjertig i boken ¬´Begge sider¬ª som slippes 5. november.
The Guardian har f√•tt tilgang til enkelte deler av selvbiografien.
Avisen gjengir et m√∏te dansken hadde med Arsenals akademisjef Liam Brady i 2004. If√∏lge Bendtner mente Brady at han hadde et helt feil fokus. Dansken ble beskyldt for √• ha for store tanker om seg selv.
‚Äì Jeg f√•r en lang tirade om at jeg var en stor fisk i en liten dam i Danmark. At jeg ser p√• fotball som noe jeg er automatisk best i. Jeg fikk h√∏re at jeg ikke burde tenke p√• biler, dyre klokker og modellkj√¶rester. Det er noe man f√•r n√•r man fortjener det, og den eneste veien dit er hardt arbeid, gjengir dansken.
Bendtner skj√∏nte lite av kritikken. P√• denne tiden hadde han v√¶rt i klubben i tre m√•neder. Han hadde nettopp begynt √• trene med f√∏rstelaget under Ars√®ne Wengers ledelse.
‚Äì Jeg forventet ikke at noe var galt, for Wenger hadde allerede rost meg mange ganger mens jeg trente med f√∏rstelaget. Men der tok jeg feil, skriver Bendtner.

T√•rene rant
S√• kom sjokkbeskjeden: Brady fortalte at Bendtner var i fare for √• bli droppet fra akademiet. Holdningene var ikke etter Arsenals standard.
‚Äì Du skal tilbake til K√∏benhavn, sa Brady, if√∏lge boken.
Bendtner svarte direkte tilbake:
‚Äì Nei, det skal jeg ikke.
Men s√• begynte t√•rene √• renne fra danskens kinn. Plutselig inns√• Bendtner hvor mye han √∏nsket √• bli profesjonell fotballspiller. Han skj√∏nte at √• spille for Arsenal var den store dr√∏mmen, og at han var p√• vei til √• √∏delegge for seg selv.
‚Äì Det er f√∏rste gang jeg startet √• gr√•te foran noen andre enn mine egne foreldre, forteller Bendtner.

Skjelt ut av Henry
Videre forteller den n√•v√¶rende K√∏benhavn-spilleren om da han skal ha havnet i en konfrontasjon med lagets store stjerne Thierry Henry.
Den franske VM-vinneren regnes som en av de beste og viktigste Arsenal-spillerne gjennom tidene. I en √•rrekke var han toppscorer i Premier League og noterte seg for totalt 258 kamper og 175 m√•l i ligaen for London-klubben.
Da Henry under en trenings√∏velse brukte tre touch, selv om reglene tilsa at kun to ber√∏ringer var lov, reagerte Bendtner. Svaret han fikk i retur var brutalt.
‚Äì Henry ber meg om √• holde kjeft. Denne gangen med en rekke banneord inkludert, hevder Bendtner i boken.

Dansken svarte med samme mynt. Han sa at det var Henry som burde holde munn. Like etter hadde Bendtner tre ber√∏ringer p√• ballen og ble straffet umiddelbart. Bendtner klaget over at reglene ikke var like for alle.
Etter treningen tok Henry en prat med Bendtner. Den samtalen varte i to timer. If√∏lge boken satte Henry unggutten p√• plass og kom samtidig med gode r√•d.
‚Äì Jeg sugde alt til meg, og det endte med at vi ga hverandre en klem. Jeg trodde at saken var ute av verden. Det var den ikke. Den neste m√•neden fikk jeg ikke trene med f√∏rstelaget, sier dansken.
Til slutt fikk likevel dansken sjansen p√• f√∏rstelaget. Totalt spilte han 108 ligakamper og scoret 24 m√•l i ligaen for storklubben.

The meeting that became an alarm for Bendtner: - I started to cry
Nicklas Bendtner is up to date with a new book. Now he openly talks about when he, as a young boy, was being thrown out of the Arsenal Academy.
01 Nov 2019, 16:33 by Viljam Brodahl
The Danish striker came to Arsenal at the age of 16. He undoubtedly had a great talent for football, but the mentality was putting an end to the former Rosenborg player. He says so openly in the book ""Both sides"" which is released on November 5.
The Guardian has access to some parts of the autobiography.
The newspaper reproduces a meeting the Danish had with Arsenal's academic manager Liam Brady in 2004. According to Bendtner, Brady thought he had a completely wrong focus. The Danes were accused of having excessive thoughts about themselves.
- I get a long tirade that I was a big fish in a small pond in Denmark. That I view football as something that I am automatically the best at. I was told that I should not think about cars, expensive watches and model girlfriends. It is something you get when you deserve it, and the only way to do that is hard work, the Danish replies.
Bendtner understood little of the criticism. By this time he had been at the club for three months. He had just started training with the first team under Ars√®ne Wenger's leadership.
- I didn't expect anything was wrong, because Wenger had already praised me many times while training with the first team. But there I was wrong, writes Bendtner.

Tears ran down
Then came the shock message: Brady told Bendtner he was in danger of being dropped out of the academy. The attitudes were not up to Arsenal's standard.
""You're going back to Copenhagen,"" Brady said, according to the book.
Bendtner replied directly back:
- No I will not.
But then the tears began to flow from the cheeks of the Danish. Suddenly, Bendtner realized how much he wanted to become a professional football player. He realized that playing for Arsenal was the big dream and that he was on the verge of ruining for himself.
- This is the first time I started crying in front of someone other than my own parents, says Bendtner.

Curse of Henry
Furthermore, the current Copenhagen player talks about when he should have ended up in a confrontation with the team's big star Thierry Henry.
The French World Cup winner is considered one of the best and most important Arsenal players of all time. For a number of years he was the top scorer in the Premier League, noting a total of 258 matches and 175 goals in the league for the London club.
When Henry used three touches during a training exercise, even though the rules indicated that only two touches were allowed, Bendtner responded. The response he received in return was brutal.
- Henry asks me to shut up. This time with a number of profanity included, Bendtner claims in the book.

The Danish replied with the same coin. He said it was Henry who should keep his mouth shut. Shortly after, Bendtner had three touches on the ball and was punished immediately. Bendtner complained that the rules were not the same for everyone.
After the training, Henry had a chat with Bendtner. That conversation lasted two hours. According to the book, Henry put the young boy in his place and came with good advice.
- I sucked everything on myself, and we ended up hugging each other. I thought the case was out of the world. It wasn't. The next month I did not train with the first team, says the Danish.
In the end, however, the Danish got the chance at the first team. In total, he played 108 league games and scored 24 goals in the major club league.
