01 Nov 2019, 16:59 by Andrew Sacher



Junglepussy


It has been one hell of a week for hip hop. The surprise new Earl Sweatshirt album arrived today (along with a video for “East,” which you can watch below), and you can read more about that album, the first Gang Starr album in 16 years, and the somewhat hip hop-adjacent Sudan Archives and Michael Kiwanuka albums over in Notable Releases. Plus, we got the announcement that we’re getting a new Wiki album next week (and a new single), a new Vince Staples Show episode/song, a new Buddy album announcement and song, a new Miguel EP announcement and song; and singles from Kamaiyah, Junglepussy, Griselda, Clams Casino, dvsn/Future, Ariana/Nicki, Teyana Taylor/Kehlani, Young Thug/Travis Scott, AJ Tracey/Skepta, 21 Savage, and more. Read on for all the hip hop we posted on BV this week…

EARL SWEATSHIRT – “EAST”

Earl Sweatshirt’s very good new project Feet of Clay is out today (read our review), and along with the release came a video for the accordion-fueled “East.”



—

VINCE STAPLES – “SHEET MUSIC”

Vince Staples returned with the second episode of The Vince Staples Show, along with this accompanying new song, and you can read more about it here.



—

WIKI – “PESTO”

Wiki announced today that he’ll have a new album out next week, and the announcement was accompanied by new single “Pesto,” which you can read more about here.



—

BUDDY – “HOLLYWOOD” (ft. KENT JAMZ)

Compton rapper Buddy is planning to follow his 2018 debut album Harlan & Alondra with a new album in spring 2020, and while most details on that are still TBA, today he released a very promising new single “Hollywood.” Equipped with a hook that pays homage to Cam’ron’s “Oh Boy,” the song is an addictive dose of neo-soul-tinged rap.



—

MIGUEL – “FUNERAL”

Miguel is back with his first proper single in a while, which doubles as the title track of a forthcoming EP. The song goes back and forth between a descending psychedelic melody that sounds like a modern pop twist on late ’60s Beatles, and a slicked-up, bass-heavy verse that sounds like FutureSex/LoveSounds era Justin Timberlake.



—

KAMAIYAH – “BACK TO BASICS”

The great G-Funk revivalist is getting “back to basics” on her new single, which is built around a sample of Michael McDonald’s “I Keep Forgettin’,” the same source material for Warren G’s G-Funk classic “Regulate.” This is Kamaiyah in her comfort zone, and it’s predictably great stuff.



—

JUNGLEPUSSY – “SPIDERS”

Just in time for Halloween, Brooklyn rapper Junglepussy shared the new single “Spiders,” which sounds as creepy as you’d hope, and comes with a well-matched video.



—

WESTSIDE GUNN – “KOOL G” (ft. BENNY THE BUTCHER & CONWAY THE MACHINE)

Another posse cut from the Griselda Records crew has arrived (co-produced by in-house producer Daringer and frequent collaborator The Alchemist), and it delivers exactly what you want from these guys: tough, ’90s New York style bars over a hypnotic, hazy beat.



—

CLAMS CASINO – “RUNE”

Clams Casino, who helped pioneer cloud rap and has produced songs by A$AP Rocky, Lil B, Mac Miller, The Weeknd, Schoolboy Q, and more, has announced his second studio album. It’s called Moon Trip Radio, it’ll be here next week (November 7 via Columbia/Sony), and the first single is the eerie, atmospheric “Rune.”



—

DVSN – “NO CRYIN” (ft. FUTURE)

OVO R&B duo dvsn (aka singer Daniel Daley and frequent Drake producer Nineteen85) and Future have put their heads together for a double dose of melancholic star power on new single “No Cryin.”



—

JUTO – WOOL (EP STREAM)

Juto was the first signee to former Odd Future member Taco’s Re7ax Records, and after releasing his debut EP Velvet earlier this year, he’s back today with a second new EP, Wool. He’s also playing Tyler the Creator’s Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival next weekend, and it’s not hard to see why the Odd Future guys are into Juto. He’s got an R&B/rap/psychedelia blend that fits right in with the world OF created.



—

ARIANA GRANDE, NORMANI & NICKI MINAJ – “BAD TO YOU”

The Ariana Grande-produced Charlie’s Angels soundtrack is out today, and in addition to the previously released Ariana/Miley Cyrus/Lana Del Rey song, it features two other anticipated Ariana collabs. One is this one with Normani and frequent collaborator Nicki Minaj, and if you dig the previous Ariana/Nicki collabs, you’ll probably wanna hear this one too.



—

ARIANA GRANDE & CHAKA KHAN – “NOBODY”

The other anticipated — and less expected — Ariana collab from the Charlie’s Angels soundtrack is this one with the legendary Chaka Khan. The production aims to strike a balance between Chaka’s vintage soul and Ariana’s modern polished pop and it’s… not as well-matched as an Ariana/Nicki song, but A for effort.



—

TEYANA TAYLOR & KEHLANI – “MORNING”

R&B singers Teyana Taylor and Kehlani put their heads — and, as seen in the video, their bodies — together for what Teyana herself calls “da magic for da moanin.” It’s probably technically safe for work… but better suited for the bedroom.



—

AJ TRACEY & SKEPTA – “KISS & TELL”

Fresh off releasing the expanded deluxe edition of his self-titled debut album, rising grime MC AJ Tracey links with veteran grime icon Skepta for this very fun new collab.



—

YOUNG THUG – “HOT” (REMIX ft. TRAVIS SCOTT & GUNNA)

Travis Scott (who dropped off Day N Vegas at the last minute) has hopped on a new remix of “Hot” by Young Thug (who was added to Day N Vegas at the last minute). (And like the album version, Gunna is here too.)



—

21 SAVAGE – “IMMORTAL”

After previewing it in the trailer for Mortal Kombat 11 late last year, 21 Savage has finally officially released his new song “Immortal,” which finds him sounding as threatening as you’d hope for from a song in Mortal Kombat.



—

NORMANI – “MOTIVATION” (21 SAVAGE REMIX)

Need even more Savage? He also remixed Normani’s unstoppable “Motivation” this week.



—

ANGEL HAZE – “BLACK BUTTERFLY”

Angel Haze has a new album on the way, but first she unveiled standalone single “Black Butterfly,” which she says had to be left off the album due to sample clearances, and which is an ode to her mother (and released on her mother’s 50th birthday). “My mom has been an incredible influence over my life and my art and my person consequently. I owe her so much more than a song and an apology,” she says.



—

TROUBLE – “AIN’T MY FAULT” (ft. BOOSIE BADAZZ)

Trouble and Boosie Badazz join forces for this slice of bouncy, trunk-rattling, Southern trap. Tis a slapper.
