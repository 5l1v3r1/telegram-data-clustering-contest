01 Nov 2019, 16:44 by 樓市
香港現受內外經濟下滑影響，預料第三季經濟會錄得負增長，甚至第四季會有更差的表現，市場認為樓市已響起轉差信號，不少投資者都想在這個跌市下找尋入市機會，但一般人難以預測樓市何時見底。不過，置業人士可以留意三個轉跌回升信號。

根據中原城市領先指數（CCL）顯示，樓價指數已連跌近五個月，由6月時的190.48點，跌至最新的180.07點，共累跌5.5%。 脫苦海認為，現時樓市開始轉差，至少仍要一年時間才會見底，但他建議投資者應忍手不買，等待明年農曆新年假期後考慮買入。 政策放寬未致轉勢 置業人士若怕錯失機會，脫苦海指可以參考以下三個訊號。 第一個訊號是政府放鬆政策，買第二層樓仍要支付樓價15%的從價印花稅，舉例如果要買入一間價值約800萬元的物業，置業人士便需付120萬元的從價印花稅。

他認為現時買樓投資需要樓價升30%才可以打和，因此現時沒有理由入市， 不過一旦政府撤銷辣招，投資者便可以考慮入市。 第二個訊號是新產業興起，如果有香港有新產業出現，或可以帶動樓市上升。 如同香港在2003年時，「自由行」帶動經濟增長，雖然未知將來會否有其他新產業，不過最有可能的是香港繼續做資本輸出，如貨幣兌換，成為中國和美國兩大地區的緩衝區。
他笑言，不認同香港在創科方面可以成功，因為香港社會風氣並不鼓勵創業，只會鼓勵投資，所以不要期望創科成為下個帶動樓市的產業。 第三個訊號是租金回報上升至3厘至4厘以上，過去十年香港樓價升幅遠遠大於租金，預期到未來租金跌幅會低於樓價，導致租金回報上升，投資者才可以體現到買樓收租的價值。 參考美聯物業資料顯示，租金回報率開始回升（見下圖）。



不過，扣除差餉、管理費及維修開支的租金回報率可能未必能保得住3厘。脫苦海指租金回報率和按揭息率相差不遠，買樓投資無意思。 他認為過去十年投資者可以「瞌埋眼」來買樓投資等升幅，但現時遊戲規則已經轉變。 投資物業回歸至賺租為本的代， 尤其是當樓價跌20%，導致租金回報率升至3至4厘，始可賺現金流。

01 Nov 2019, 16:44 by the property market
Hong Kong is now affected by the economic downturn between the inside and the outside. It is expected that the economy will record negative growth in the third quarter, and even worse in the fourth quarter. The market believes that the property market has already signaled a slip, and many investors want to find it under this falling market. Entering the market, but it is difficult for the average person to predict when the property market will bottom out. However, home buyers can pay attention to the three signs of a rebound.

According to the Central Plains City Leading Index (CCL), the property price index has fallen for nearly five months, from 190.48 points in June to the latest 180.07 points, a total drop of 5.5%. Desperately believes that the current property market is starting to turn worse, at least it will take a year to bottom out, but he suggests that investors should not afford to buy, waiting to consider buying after the Lunar New Year holiday next year. Policy relaxation has not turned into a trend If homebuyers are afraid of missing opportunities, the Desiccation Sea Index can refer to the following three signals. The first signal is the government's relaxation policy. If you buy a second floor, you still have to pay 15% of the ad valorem stamp duty. For example, if you want to buy a property worth about 8 million yuan, the home buyers will have to pay 1.2 million yuan. Ad valorem stamp duty.

He believes that the current investment in flats requires a 30% increase in property prices to be able to fight. Therefore, there is no reason to enter the market at present. However, once the Government withdraws the hotspot, investors can consider entering the market. The second signal is the rise of new industries. If there are new industries in Hong Kong, it may drive the property market to rise. Just as Hong Kong in 2003, ""free travel"" led to economic growth. Although it is unknown whether there will be other new industries in the future, it is most likely that Hong Kong will continue to do capital export, such as currency exchange, and become a buffer for China and the United States. Area.
He smiled and disagreed that Hong Kong could succeed in creating a science, because Hong Kong's social atmosphere does not encourage entrepreneurship and only encourages investment, so don't expect Shinco to become the next industry to drive the property market. The third signal is that the rental return has risen to 3% to 4%. In the past ten years, Hong Kong property prices have risen far more than rents. It is expected that the rental decline will be lower than the property price in the future, which will lead to an increase in rental returns. The value of buying a building to rent. According to the information of Midland Realty, the rental return rate began to pick up (see the chart below).



However, the rental return rate after deduction of rates, management fees and maintenance expenses may not be able to secure 3%. The rental return rate of the Desalination Sea Index is not far from the mortgage interest rate, and the investment in buying a building is not interesting. He believes that in the past ten years, investors have been able to ""buy their eyes"" to buy housing investment and other increases, but the current rules of the game have changed. Returning investment properties to a rent-based generation, especially when property prices fall by 20%, resulting in a rental return rate of 3 to 4%, which can be used to earn cash flow.
