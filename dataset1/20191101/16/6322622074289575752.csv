In addition, Liew said the Commission proposed would not take over the duties of renewal of the laws from any Ministry or department but functioned in improving and supporting the renewal of the law efforts by numerous quarters.
""In line with the open government concept, the engagement sessions of the stakeholders will be held to obtain feedback from all strata of society on the setting up of the Law Commission and Ombudsman Malaysia,"" he added.
