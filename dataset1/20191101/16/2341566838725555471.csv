（中央社記者余曉涵台北1日電）氣象局表示，東北風明天起減弱，將轉為多雲到晴的天氣型態，不過，下週一（4日）起東北風再度增強，水氣也會增加，中部以北低溫可能探攝氏18度，高溫則在25度上下。
中央氣象局表示，東北風影響，白天水氣仍多，宜蘭、花蓮一帶上半天仍有較顯著降雨，下半天水氣漸減，迎風面降雨才逐漸緩和，雨區縮小，僅東半部地區及北部山區局部降雨，其他地區則是多雲到晴的天氣。
氣象局表示，這波東北風預計明天減弱，各地將轉為多雲到晴的天氣型態，下週一（4日）起東北風會再度增強，水氣也會增多，中部以北低溫恐下探18度到20度，高溫部分則是在25度上下。
不過，氣象局表示，4日起的東北風強度不夠強（台北測站低溫需低於20度），尚未達到東北季風的等級。（編輯：葉俐緯）1081101
