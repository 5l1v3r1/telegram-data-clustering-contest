朋友做傳銷 帶我見「成功人士」 最後搞到要絕交｜藍橘子

正所謂「橋唔怕舊，最緊要受！」層壓式傳銷能夠活存到今時今日，證明他們仍有生存空間，仍不斷有人跳進傳銷圈子內。「其實唔係個個傳銷都係衰人。」這句話是每個傳銷都會說的，在我的人生中，有遇過不下十次被傳銷推銷。但幸好我本來跟他們不熟，很快就拒絕了。

身邊朋友去咗做傳銷
但其中一次，身邊的朋友做傳銷，因而影響到我們的朋友關係。第一次，是一個工作認識的朋友，由於我們住的地方很近，也有玩同樣的手機遊戲，所以幾乎每天下班都一起回家，有時還會一起吃飯。某天，他突然說想請我吃飯，說他最近偷偷的在「建立自己的事業」。
我起初以為他在做生意…下班後他把我帶到「老麥」，還煞有介事說：「今晚請你食老麥，可能你會恥笑我，但兩年之後，我會帶你去一間你成世人都唔捨得去嘅餐廳，請你食飯，開一枝你從未飲過嘅紅酒！」說這句話的他，眼裡綻放出光茫。
接著，他帶我去跟他的生意伙伴們見面。他們所有人都穿著西裝，一邊吃薯條，一邊說某某同事上年環遊世界，只工作了一個月就賺了十多萬。某某同事每次見客戶都開跑車，戴勞力士，反而更多客人相信他了。他們還會鼓勵新加入的同事，全枱人一起鼓掌，被一群開跑車、戴勞力士、環遊世界的成功人士拍掌鼓勵，那種澎湃的成就感正是令我朋友著迷的原因。
當晚，他向我推銷，叫我加入他的下線。他本來是某人的下線，如今他自己開一條線，想跟我「拍住上」。他第一句說跟我說「放心！我們不是層壓式傳銷！」然後慢慢講解他們的架構，就是就上線邀請朋友加入做下線，下線再邀請其他人加入，做上線就會收到佣金。只要趁早加入，站在上線的位置，以後就由其他人來幫你賺錢，而你不用付出任何勞力。
他還跟我說「二八定律」，這社會80%人幫20%人掙錢，只要現在加入，就能成為那20%的人，用其餘80%人幫我們賺錢。天啊！那不就是層壓式推銷嗎？！你這條Team現在只得你和我，哪裡二八了？！我還在你下線，就是說最少要找10個人加入才能二八啊！

想拉朋友離開傳銷圈子
當時我說要考慮一下，但我更想做的，是將他拉出這個傳銷圈子。我朋友說，人生命裡就要跟一班正面、積極、有成就的人混一起，刪除那些負面、消極、沒貢獻的人，這樣就更容易擠進成功行列裡。「你意思係…啱啱成班拍晒手掌，一齊食老麥嘅人就係成功人士？」我問。「係啊！佢哋係公司高層，好少有機會同我哋見面，佢哋真係好好人！」朋友。
曾經有一個做保險的朋友告訴我，做保險、地產、傳銷…千萬不要把身邊的人拉進去。第一：別人會覺得你當他們是傻子。第二：把這班人拉進來，只會綁死你自己。他們根本不會幫你繼續傳銷，保險出問題，他們會要求你盡200%的力量幫他解決，既煩人，又沒效果。
可是，我朋友愈陷愈深，原來他的所有朋友、同事、甚至家人…全都被他推銷過了，大家都開始避開他。而我堅決拒絕他之後，他也將我視為一個「不長進、負面、沒貢獻」的人，從他的生命中刪除了我。

Friends do MLM, take me to see ""successful people"", finally get to the end of the year | blue oranges
01 Nov 2019, 16:27 by blue orange
The so-called ""bridge is afraid of the old, the most important thing!"" Laminated MLM can survive to this day and prove that they still have room to survive, and people continue to jump into the pyramid scheme. ""In fact, all the pyramid schemes are fading."" This sentence is what every pyramid scheme will say. In my life, there have been no more than ten times of pyramid scheme sales. Fortunately, I was not familiar with them and quickly refused.

Friends around to go and do pyramid schemes
But once, the friends around me do pyramid schemes, which affects our friend relationship. For the first time, I was a friend of work. Because we lived in a very close place and played the same mobile games, I went home almost every day after work, sometimes eating together. One day, he suddenly said that he wanted to invite me to dinner, saying that he recently secretly ""established his own business.""
I thought he was doing business at first... After he got off work, he took me to the ""old wheat"" and said, ""I want to eat old wheat tonight, maybe you will laugh at me, but after two years, I will take you to one. Everyone in the world is willing to go to the restaurant, please eat rice, open a branch you have never had a drink of red wine!"" He said this sentence, his eyes bloomed.
Then he took me to meet his business partners. All of them were wearing suits and eating French fries, while saying that a certain colleague traveled around the world last year and earned more than 100,000 for only one month. Every time a colleague sees a customer, he drives a sports car and wears a Rolex. On the contrary, more guests believe him. They will also encourage new colleagues to join, and the whole Taiwan applaud and be applauded by a group of successful people who drive sports cars, wear Rolex, and travel around the world. The kind of awkward sense of accomplishment is what fascinates my friends.
That night, he sold me to me and asked me to join him. He was originally someone's downline, and now he is opening a line himself and wants to ""take a picture with me."" His first sentence said to me, ""Relax! We are not a pyramid scheme!"" Then slowly explain their structure, that is, invite friends to join the line on the line, invite others to join the line, and receive commission on the line. . As long as you join early, stand on the line, and later someone else will help you make money, and you don't have to pay any labor.
He also told me about the ""two-eighth law"". 80% of the people in this society help 20% of the people to earn money. If they join now, they will become the 20%, and the other 80% will help us make money. God! Isn't that a laminate marketing? ! You are the only team you and me now, where is it? ! I am still off the assembly line, that is to say, at least 10 people must be joined to join the 28th!

Want to pull friends out of the MLM circle
At that time, I said that I had to think about it, but what I wanted to do was to pull him out of this pyramid scheme. My friend said that people must be mixed with a group of positive, active, and accomplished people to remove those who are negative, negative, and uncontributed, so that it is easier to squeeze into the ranks of success. ""What do you mean by smashing into a palm of your hand, and eating a good old man is a successful person?"" I asked. ""Department! The department is the top executive of the company. I have a good chance to meet with me. The channel is really good!"" Friends.
I once had a friend who was insured telling me to do insurance, real estate, pyramid schemes... Don't pull people around. First: others will think that you are a fool when they are. Second: Pulling this group in will only tie you up. They will not help you continue to sell pyramids, insurance problems, they will ask you to do 200% of the power to help him solve, both annoying and ineffective.
However, my friend got deeper and deeper. It turned out that all his friends, colleagues, and even his family... all were sold by him, and everyone started to avoid him. After I firmly rejected him, he also regarded me as a person who ""does not grow, negative, and does not contribute"" and removed me from his life.
