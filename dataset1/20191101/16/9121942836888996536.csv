01 Nov 2019, 16:16 by Ryan Divish
With the 2019 Major League Baseball officially season over  — congratulations to the Washington Nationals — the offseason officially started on Thursday.
The Extra Innings podcast returns to wrap an interesting postseason that the Mariners didn’t participate in … again.
