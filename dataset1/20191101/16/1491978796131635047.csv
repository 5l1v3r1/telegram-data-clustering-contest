Cocktail of the week: Bancone’s amaresso martini recipe
01 Nov 2019, 16:00 by Bruno di Martino

Almost as much a boozy dessert as a cocktail, this is the ultimate almond-scented coffee cocktail to sip by the fireside of an autumn evening

If you’ve ever got any espresso left over in the pot after breakfast, don’t pour it down the sink; pour it into a sealed container, save it and use it up in this cosy cocktail when you get home in the evening.
Serves 2
30ml amaretto – we use Disaronno30ml Kahlua 30ml room-temperature espressoA scattering of toasted ground almonds, to garnish
Fill a shaker with ice, pour in the liqueurs and coffee, and shake vigorously for 10-20 seconds – the more you shake, the more froth you’ll create. Strain into two martini glasses, garnish with toasted ground almonds and serve.
