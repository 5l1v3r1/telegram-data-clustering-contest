FC Barcelona trained on Friday ahead of Saturday's league game away against Levante in Valencia. The main news was the presence of Samuel Umtiti, who could return from a knee problem this weekend. Jordi Alba, who ended the game against Real Valladolid with a problem, also took part.
Umtiti has played just once this season, away at Eibar. The Frenchman then injured his knee and missed the trip to Prague for the Champions League game against Slavia. He also missed the win over Real Valladolid in La Liga in midweek. After Friday's session, the club's medical team will decide if he's fit for Levante.
Alba, meanwhile, was taken off against Valladolid with a knock. However, he should be fine for Saturday.
Birthday bumps for Ansu Fati
There was a good atmosphere at the start of the training session as the players performed the traditional tunnel when it's a teammates' birthday. This time it was Ansu Fati celebrating. He turned 17 on Thursday and ran through the gauntlet ahead of the session.
