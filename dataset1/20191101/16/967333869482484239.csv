Indian Girl Seeks Eligible Groom for Widowed Mother, Twitterati Lauds her Liberal Outlook

01 Nov 2019, 16:30


New Delhi (Sputnik): In deeply traditional and conservative India, parents often seek partners for their children in marriage. It is rather unusual for children to seek partners for their widowed mothers or fathers, much less search for them publically.

One young girl has posted a proposal for a groom for her widowed mother on her Twitter handle, inviting many curious responses. Some lauded her liberal intentions, many posted memes and some even directly proposed.
The tweet contained her mother’s photograph with her and the description reads “Looking for a handsome 50 year-old-man for my mother! J Vegetarian, Non-Drinker, Well Established”



​A lot many Twitter users commented on her progressive thought and blessed her, while one user from Pakistan extolled her courage for looking for a partner for her single-parent. All the very best and peace and love from Pakistan.”


















There were even some proposals directly in response and some memes as well.


















The marriage of widows is still a taboo in India, although it was legalised way back in 1856 during British colonial rule. While these thick social chains are breaking in certain societies, it is still not encouraged in rural India.  Many are sent back to their parental homes, to prevent them from claiming the inheritance of the property of their deceased husbands.
In Vrindavan, a town around 200 kilometres south of the national capital New Delhi, one can find thousands of widows, mostly from eastern West Bengal, who were cast out by their families.  They spend the rest of their lives in ashrams or shelters run by religious organizations and often resort to begging near temples.
