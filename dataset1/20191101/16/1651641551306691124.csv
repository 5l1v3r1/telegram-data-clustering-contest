01 Nov 2019, 16:55 by Pradeep





Google Maps today announced that Incognito mode is now rolling out to Android users. When you enable Incognito mode in Google Maps, all the activities you do in Maps like the places you search, directions you searched for and others won’t be saved to your Google Account. When Incognito mode is enabled, Google Maps will not:

Save your browse or search history, or send you notifications
Update your Location History or shared location, if any
Use your personal data to personalize Maps

Following features won’t be available in Incognito mode:

Commute
For You

Location History

Tip: Location History will be paused for your entire device, not just Maps.


Location Sharing
Notifications and messages
Search history
Search completion suggestions
Google Maps Contributions
Google Assistant microphone in Navigation
Offline Maps
Your Places
Media integration

To enable Incognito mode, open the Google Maps app and tap your profile picture, you will find the “Turn on Incognito mode” feature.
