'And the circus continues...' - Stoke City fans react as Nathan Jones is sacked before West Brom clash
West Bromwich Albion latest - The Baggies will be hoping not to fall victim to a new manager bounce when they meet Stoke City on Monday.

Stoke City are in limbo ahead of their clash with West Bromwich Albion early next week.
The two teams are set to do battle at the bet355 Stadium on Monday night, and ahead of the game, the Potters have axed manager Nathan Jones.
Jones has been sacked after an ill-fated seven months in charge, leaving Stoke just one place off the bottom of the table and four points from safety.
The Welshman arrived at Stoke in January, leaving Luton Town to take over from Gary Rowett.
Stoke are now left searching for a new manager ahead of Monday's clash with the league-leading Baggies with second-place Preston's Alex Neil favourite.
