Kelvin Gastelum arouses controversy over UFC 244 weigh-in, appears to lean on coach while making weight
01 Nov 2019, 16:45 by Lewis Mckeever



Kelvin Gastelum has successfully made weight for UFC 244, hitting the scales at 184 lbs. ahead of his highly anticipated middleweight bout with Darren Till at Madison Square Garden.

Not long after making weight, however, accusations of cheating began to arise after video footage appears to show Gastelum leaning on his coach while on the scales.
Check out the video footage below to decide for yourself whether or not Gastelum flouted the rules to give himself an unfair advantage.






“There’s some controversy about Kelvin Gastelum’s weigh-in,” FanSided’s Amy Kaplan reported on Twitter. “It appears as though he’s leaning on his coach for the weigh-in. It’s reminiscent of Daniel Cormier’s #towelgate. Also worth noting that Kelvin did not use the hoop, all other fighters did.”
Given Gastelum has already made weight and likely started rehydrating, it’s highly unlikely the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) will force the former interim middleweight title challenger to weigh in again.
Gastelum is scheduled to take on middleweight newcomer Darren Till in the UFC 244 co-main event tomorrow night at New York’s Madison Square Garden. The pay-per-view extravaganza is headlined by a ‘BMF’ title bout between UFC fan favorites Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz.
