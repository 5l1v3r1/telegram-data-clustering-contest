During the show, Hart and Corden shared a sketch which saw the host playing Sabrina’s cousin, who is visiting her from Washington. He drops in to let her know about a new superpower she possesses. Watch the sketch below.



Hart starred in the sitcom from 1996 to 2003. Last year, a new reboot called The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina came to Netflix, starring Kiernan Shipka in Hart’s old role.
A second series of the show followed earlier this year, with seasons 3 and 4 already in the works.
In a review of the first season of The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, NME’s Hannah Mylrea said the show was “a million miles from the 90s classic, but a wickedly charming watch”.
“Not without it’s flaws, as in Aguirre-Sacasa’s Riverdale it can be outrageously over the top, and a little silly; but in general The Chilling Adventures Of Sabrina is wickedly enticing watch. Move over gory horror films, here’s your Halloween viewing, it’ll definitely be more fun.”
