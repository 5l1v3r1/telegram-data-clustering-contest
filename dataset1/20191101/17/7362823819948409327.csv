Philina Cha visited a Starbucks in Northeast Portland on Nov. 6, 2017, where she ordered a hot coffee and cup of hot water. She claims she was given hot water that did not have a properly secured lid, according to the lawsuit. The water spilled down her leg and into her boot, causing severe burns that required skin grafts and left scarring.

The suit, which was filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court Tuesday, seeks $38,000 for medical bills and $250,000 for pain, suffering and embarrassment from the scarring, the Oregonian reported.

Starbucks has faced lawsuits over its beverage temperatures in the past. In May 2017, the coffee chain paid $100,000 to a Florida customer after a hot coffee left her physically scarred.
In September of that same year, a Denver woman sued Starbucks, claiming the scalding hot tea she was served spilled through an unsecured lid and left her with burns, and killed her dog.
