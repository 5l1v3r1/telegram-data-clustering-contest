90後到日本就醫啟發創業！開「日本醫療中介公司」半年收支平衡
01 Nov 2019, 17:41 by 創業
香港人喜歡購買日本產品，視「Made in Japan」為品質的保證，但卻鮮有聽聞港人到日本就醫或者接受其他治療服務，因普遍覺得當地醫療費用高昂，而且言語不通。兩名90後因曾有家人及親友需要前往日本接受醫療，其後不斷有朋友向他們查詢相關情況，因而萌生成立日本醫療中介公司的念頭，開業短短半年，更已達致收支平衡。秋意漸濃，近期不少港人前往日本賞楓、品嘗美食、浸溫泉及購物；但有沒有想過，可以順道惠顧日本的醫療保健服務？原來現時香港有日本醫療中介公司，可代為預約當地醫療服務，更提供即時的醫療翻譯，這樣便不用擔心言語不通的問題。

質子治療費較美國低75%
日醫JP APEX聯合創辦人兼董事總經理葉梓銘（Victor），於英國倫敦大學學院修讀工商管理學士期間，認識在當地修讀會計及財務的日醫JP APEX聯合創辦人/董事總經理董健浩（Kevin），經常一起玩樂。Victor畢業返港後，隨即到內地的中小型地產公司任職，從事前線銷售員，前後工作了約兩年時間。後來，Victor的親友患上初期肺癌，本地醫院建議進行傳統的治療方法，包括電療及化療，但親友希望找尋第二醫療意見，於是他便幫忙上網搜尋資料，發覺質子治療是另一個可行的方案。

所謂質子治療，其實是放射性治療的一種，但是放射線能夠更加對準腫瘤位置，提升治療成效。香港一直也有討論引入質子治療，但直至2016年養和醫院才斥資30億元，引入本港首部質子治療系統，並計劃於2020年開始投入服務。據悉該院傳統放射治療計劃每療程的費用約10萬至30萬元，預期質子治療費用不會高過傳統療程兩倍。目前美國是全球擁有最多質子治療中心的國家，合共有27間，緊隨其後就是日本，共有14間，在亞洲而言是這方面治療最先進的地區。
Victor說：「在美國接受質子治療的費用約100萬元，上海約需40萬元，日本僅為20至25萬元，而且大有機會比養和醫院日後推出的費用為低。」Victor的親友到日本接受過質子治療療程，需於當地逗留約一個月時間，當地醫院建議另外接受自體免疫細胞療法，這種治療是從患者身上抽取免疫細胞，然後通過培養加工，再注入體內攻擊癌細胞。日本醫生建議患者先接檢測，了解免疫系統內各種細胞的情況，再製定最合適的自體免疫細胞療法，通常採用注射或點滴的方式進行。Victor的親友前後打針六次，每次費用約30,000元；而每隔兩至三個月才打針一次，毋須長期逗留在日本。


日醫JP APEX可安排港人到日本國立國際醫療研究中心接受治療。

提供即時醫療翻譯服務
至於Kevin，在英國完成學業後，於2016年返港，並在會計師樓工作。由於親人不幸患上惡疾，家人擔心不己，不斷找尋各式治療對策。後來Kevin發覺，日本的自體免疫細胞治療法，能夠有效提升免疫力，便安排父親到日本接受檢測及治療，前後打針六次。Kevin和Victor有相同的經歷，發覺日本醫療水平極高，而價錢未必如想像般昂貴，但在港很難找到這方面的資訊。Kevin說：「不斷有其他親友向我們查詢關於日本的醫療服務，甚至要求幫忙安排到當地，令我們發覺市場有一定需求；於是我們去年開始籌備，辭去工作，並於今年4月成立日醫JP APEX。」


日本癌症研究會有明病院是當地著名的治癌機構。

兩人投資六位數字，租用尖沙咀區的共享工作空間，同時另外聘請三名全職員工開業；日本方面，在當地開設政府認可的第三方醫療中介公司合作，為港人提供預約及翻譯服務，醫療機構主要集中於東京。顧客預約諮詢，日醫JP APEX了解情況後，將醫療報告傳送至日本，由當地人員翻譯，再交給有關醫療機構檢視；若認為患者適合進行治療，便可預約服務。


日醫JP APEX聯合創辦人兼董事總經理葉梓銘（Victor）在日本進行高濃度維他命C點滴，作為保健。

顧客飛往日本後，於預約日期及時間到達醫療機構，屆時將有醫療翻譯陪同與醫護人員會面，進行諮詢及接受治療。Victor說：「最初顧客以香港人為主，他們試過後都向親友推介，吸引不少內地顧客，現時兩者各佔整體客源一半。」患者通常由親友陪同，甚至整個家庭出動，除了患者接受治療，親友也會考慮嘗試其他醫療項目，例如體檢或保健方案。日本在癌症診斷、治療方法方面均較先進，其精密防癌體檢可以發現5mm以下的毫米、微米級、近300種早期癌症或超初期癌症。



再生醫學研究領先20年
另外，日本的牙科治療方法亦相當先進，包括以三維CT拍攝口腔情況提高精準度，立即植牙、一天治療多處蛀牙，而且可以在無痛情況下進行，還可以將拔掉的牙齒雪藏，方便日後進行其他再生治療。全球海外醫療需求不斷上升，除了傳統醫療外（包括重症治療、醫療美容、海外體檢及育輔助），還開始走向再生醫學的大趨勢。所謂再生醫學亦可稱為細胞療法，如自體免疫細胞療法和幹細胞療法等；由於日本於20年前已開始發展再生醫學，經驗及技術均較優勝。


日醫JP APEX兩名創辦人近日參觀日本的細胞培養處理設施。

自體免疫細胞療呿是日本厚生勞働省指定的「先進醫療」項目之一，即是使用高端科技的治療方案，現時名錄上共有87種，還有脂肪幹細胞療法、APS/幹細胞療法等，日醫JP APEX可以協助港人在日本找尋合適的治療方案。日醫JP APEX於今年4月正式投入服務，半年內已達到收支平衡，由於不少顧客是多人成行，現正研究與旅行社合作，推出更加全面的服務，包括安排住宿及交通等。


自體免疫細胞療法共有三重，需因應每個人的身體狀況製定方案。

醫療保險包唔包？
CFP認可財務策劃師周榮佳（Wave）說：「絕大部分在香港購買的住院保險計劃，無論在全球哪個地方治療，基本上都會依計劃條文賠償，所以日本也沒有例外。」科技日新月異，不斷出現嶄新的醫療技術，只要是西方醫學其中一種治療方法，基本上一定覆蓋，除非有不保條文（exclusion），沒有寫明的話就要因應條款賠償。以友邦保險為例，旗下所有住院保險計劃，包括高端、一般及自願醫保計劃，全部覆蓋到日本接受先進醫療的治療方案。


患者先接受檢測，了解免疫系統偏各種細胞的情況，再製定最合適的自體免疫細胞療法。

患上癌症的話，除了住院保險可索償外，如有購買危疾保險，符合危疾種類及定義，可獲一筆過賠償；近年流行的癌症保險，除了一筆過賠償，日後的治療費用，亦將因應條文作出賠償。周榮佳表示，索償時並沒有特別需要注意的地方，交齊單據及報告便可；即使報告是日文也無妨，保險公司將自行安排翻譯。

After 90, I went to Japan to seek medical care and start a business! Opened a ""Japanese medical intermediary company"" half-year balance
01 Nov 2019, 17:41 by Entrepreneurship
Hong Kong people like to buy Japanese products and regard ""Made in Japan"" as a guarantee of quality. However, it is rarely heard that Hong Kong people go to Japan for medical treatment or other treatment services because they generally feel that local medical expenses are high and they are not fluent. After the 90s, there were family members and relatives who needed to go to Japan for medical treatment. Since then, friends have been asking them about the situation. As a result, the idea of establishing a Japanese medical intermediary company has been initiated. It has been closed for half a year and has achieved a balance of payments. Autumn is getting stronger. Recently, many Hong Kong people have traveled to Japan to enjoy maple, taste food, soak hot springs and shopping. But have you ever thought about patronizing Japan's health care services? It turns out that there are Japanese medical intermediaries in Hong Kong that can make appointments for local medical services and provide immediate medical translations so that there is no need to worry about speechlessness.

Proton therapy costs 75% lower than in the US
Victor, the co-founder and managing director of JP APEX, studied under the Bachelor of Business Administration at University College London, and met with the Japanese Practitioner JP APEX co-founder/Director Dong Jianhao (Kevin), often have fun together. After returning to Hong Kong, Victor graduated from the small and medium-sized real estate company in the Mainland and worked as a front-line salesman. He worked for about two years. Later, Victor's relatives and friends suffered from initial lung cancer. Local hospitals recommended traditional treatments, including electrotherapy and chemotherapy. But relatives and friends hope to find a second medical opinion, so he helped search the Internet and found that proton therapy is another feasible solution. .


Japanese doctor JP APEX co-founder and managing director Ye Haoming (Victor)

The so-called proton therapy is actually a kind of radiotherapy, but the radiation can be more aligned with the tumor location and improve the treatment effect. Hong Kong has also been discussing the introduction of proton therapy, but it was not until 2016 that Yanghe Hospital spent $3 billion to introduce Hong Kong's first proton therapy system and plans to start service in 2020. It is reported that the cost of the traditional radiotherapy program of the hospital is about 100,000 to 300,000 yuan per treatment. It is expected that the cost of proton therapy will not be more than twice that of the traditional treatment. At present, the United States is the world's largest number of proton therapy centers, with a total of 27, followed by Japan, a total of 14 in Asia, which is the most advanced treatment area in Asia.
Victor said: ""The cost of receiving proton therapy in the United States is about 1 million yuan, Shanghai is about 400,000 yuan, Japan is only 20 to 250,000 yuan, and there is a big chance that it will be lower than the cost of future hospitals."" Victor's relatives and friends I have been treated in Japan for proton therapy and need to stay in the local area for about one month. The local hospital recommends that I receive autologous immune cell therapy. This treatment is to extract immune cells from the patient and then inject them into the body to attack the cancer cells. . Japanese doctors recommend that patients first test to understand the various cells in the immune system, and then develop the most appropriate autoimmune cell therapy, usually by injection or by drip. Victor's relatives and friends had six injections before and after, each time costing about 30,000 yuan; and every two to three months before the injection, there is no need to stay in Japan for a long time.


Japanese doctor JP APEX can arrange for Hong Kong people to go to the National Center for International Medical Research in Japan for treatment.

Provide instant medical translation services
As for Kevin, after completing his studies in the UK, he returned to Hong Kong in 2016 and worked in the accounting firm. Because their loved ones are unfortunately suffering from malaria, their families worry about not being able to find various treatment strategies. Later, Kevin discovered that Japan's autoimmune cell therapy can effectively improve immunity, and then arrange for his father to go to Japan for testing and treatment, six injections before and after. Kevin and Victor have the same experience and found that Japan's medical level is extremely high, and the price may not be as expensive as imagined, but it is difficult to find information in Hong Kong. Kevin said: ""There are always other relatives and friends who ask us about medical services in Japan, and even ask for help to arrange locals. We have found that the market has certain needs; so we started preparations last year, resigned, and established Japanese doctors in April this year. JP APEX.""


The National Cancer Research Institute of Japan is a famous cancer treatment institution.

The two invested in six figures to rent a shared workspace in Tsim Sha Tsui District and hired three full-time employees to open the business. In Japan, a government-approved third-party medical agency was established to provide appointment and translation services for Hong Kong people. The organization is mainly concentrated in Tokyo. After the customer has made an appointment, the Japanese doctor JP APEX will send the medical report to Japan, and the local staff will translate it and submit it to the relevant medical institution for examination. If the patient is considered to be suitable for treatment, the service can be reserved.


Victor, the co-founder and managing director of JP APEX, is a high-concentration vitamin C in Japan for health care.

After the customer flies to Japan, they will arrive at the medical institution on the date and time of the appointment. At that time, a medical interpreter will accompany the medical staff to consult and receive treatment. Victor said: ""Initially the customers were mainly Hong Kong people. After they tried them, they all introduced them to relatives and friends. They attracted many mainland customers. Now they both account for half of the total customer base."" Patients are usually accompanied by relatives and friends, and even the whole family is dispatched, except patients. When treated, family and friends will also consider other medical programs, such as medical examinations or health care programs. Japan is more advanced in cancer diagnosis and treatment methods. Its sophisticated anti-cancer physical examination can detect millimeters, micrometers, and nearly 300 early-stage cancers or super-early cancers below 5 mm.



20 years leading in regenerative medicine research
In addition, Japanese dental treatment methods are also quite advanced, including improving the accuracy of oral cavity conditions by three-dimensional CT, implanting teeth immediately, treating multiple cavities in one day, and doing it in painless conditions, and also removing the extracted teeth. Other regenerative therapies will be carried out later. The global demand for overseas medical care is on the rise. In addition to traditional medicine (including intensive care, medical beauty, overseas medical examination and education assistance), it is also beginning to move toward the trend of regenerative medicine. Regenerative medicine can also be called cell therapy, such as autoimmune cell therapy and stem cell therapy. Since Japan began to develop regenerative medicine 20 years ago, its experience and technology are superior.


The two founders of Japanese doctor JP APEX recently visited the cell culture processing facility in Japan.

Autoimmune Cell Therapy is one of the “Advanced Medical” programs designated by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan. It is a treatment program using high-end technology. There are currently 87 types on the list, as well as adipose stem cell therapy, APS/stem cell therapy, etc. JP APEX can help Hong Kong people find suitable treatment options in Japan. Japanese doctor JP APEX officially put into service in April this year, and has reached break-even within half a year. Since many customers are multi-persons, they are studying cooperation with travel agencies to launch more comprehensive services, including accommodation and transportation.


Autoimmune cell therapy has a total of three, and it is necessary to formulate a plan according to each person's physical condition.

Medical insurance bag?
CFP-accredited financial planner Zhou Rongjia (Wave) said: ""The vast majority of hospitalization insurance plans purchased in Hong Kong, regardless of where in the world, will basically be compensated according to the plan, so there is no exception in Japan."" Technology is changing with each passing day. New medical technology, as long as it is a treatment method in Western medicine, is basically covered. Unless there is an exclusion, if it is not stated, it will be compensated according to the terms. In the case of AIA, all of its hospitalization insurance plans, including high-end, general and voluntary health insurance plans, cover all Japanese treatment programs that receive advanced medical care.


The patient is tested first to understand the immune system's bias in various cells, and then to develop the most appropriate autoimmune cell therapy.

In the case of cancer, in addition to hospital insurance claims, if you purchase critical illness insurance and meet the types and definitions of dangerous diseases, you can get one-off compensation; in recent years, the popular cancer insurance, in addition to one-off compensation, future treatment costs, will also Compensation is provided for the provisions. Zhou Rongjia said that there is no special need to pay attention to the claim, and the documents and reports can be submitted; even if the report is in Japanese, the insurance company will arrange the translation on its own.
