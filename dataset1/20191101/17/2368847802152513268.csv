孟晚舟律師團遇挫 告加警違法欲阻引渡無果

01 Nov 2019, 17:24

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】華為董事長任正非的長女、華為集團財務總監孟晚舟引渡案，目前正處於法庭聆訊階段。孟的律師團隊為中止孟被引渡到美國，攻擊加國警方在最初扣押孟晚舟時的執法行動涉嫌程序違法。但本週四的法庭文件顯示，加國騎警提交了多份宣誓書，斷然否認了辯方的相關指控。
據香港東網報導，在10月31日舉行的法庭聆訊中，加國警方斷然否認了有關警方存在程序違法的指控。而一份法庭文件顯示，加拿大檢方已向法庭提交了多份當事人的宣誓書，力證孟晚舟去年12月在溫哥華被捕之時，警方並沒有將其電子裝置資料與美國聯邦調查局（FBI）分享。報導稱，孟晚舟要求中止引渡到美國的聆訊未有結果。
加國檢察總長的代表律師其後向傳媒公開的法庭文件顯示，辯方指控王家騎警（RCMP）與FBI分享有關情報的說法並無事實根據。
據代表律師介紹，RCMP如果要與FBI人員分享情報，按規矩美方必須先提出司法互助的要求。檢察總長上個月內已向法庭提交了8份由涉事的 RCMP警員撰寫的宣誓書，澄清了事實。
據了解，就孟晚舟提出終止引渡要求，加拿大的卑詩省高等法院從今年9月23日開始開庭聆訊。孟的律師團隊為了向加拿大政府施加壓力，以便阻止孟晚舟被引渡到美國，一直試圖證明孟晚舟的權力受到侵犯，並集中火力攻擊加國警方，指其去年12月初扣留孟時存在程序違法。
孟晚舟的律師團隊堅稱，王家騎警（RCMP）於去年12月4日收繳了孟晚舟的電子產品，包括1部iPad、1部蘋果Mac Book、1部iPhone 7 Plus和1部華為Mate 20手機，將各設備的序號 、手機IMEI號碼及Sim咭號碼拍照後，交給了美國聯邦調查局。
辯方律師並指稱，孟晚舟去年12月1日被過境時，其手機屬飛行模式，但到了12月4日孟發現她的手機和電腦都曾被人開啟過。
但檢察官在法庭上列出了各種證據，力證孟晚舟律師團隊的上述指控屬於主觀臆測，並無事實根據。檢方撇清了加國王家騎警（RCMP）與美國聯邦調查局（FBI）的關係，並強調加拿大邊境服務局一直是按照法律行事，獨立執法。
美國司法機構去年底公開指控孟晚舟違反華盛頓對伊朗禁運經濟制裁，而且還向美國銀行撒謊，因而要求加拿大執法機構配合引渡孟晚舟。孟本人則對這些指控全盤否認。
