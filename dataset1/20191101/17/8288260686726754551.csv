Tim Hortons has released a full statement after a dramatic blaze outside its premises - sparked by an underground electrical fault.
Shoppers 'ran screaming' from the coffee shop after the fire and a number of explosions.
Flames were seen shooting up from the pavement outside the premises, which opened earlier this year.
A cordon is now in place, with police, fire and ambulance now at the scene.

""The restaurant was evacuated immediately, and the fire services are at the scene following an electrical fault being identified underground.
""There have been no reported injuries and a cordon is in place while the fire service carries out their work.""
Taxi driver Shazad Ali said: “My taxi was parked right at front when the explosion happened.

“I was first one there. It happened around 4.30pm. There were two or three electrical explosions coming out the drain cover outside Tim Hortons - I saw fire flames sparks coming out of the ground - really terrifying.
“People inside the store started screaming and running out. It was a good 10 mins before fire engine arrived.
""Five minutes after the explosion police arrived started moving everyone back and told me I had to leave cab because it was too dangerous.”
 
West Midlands Fire Service were contacted just after 4.20pm and crews from Ladywood and Aston are on the scene.
No one is believed to have been hurt.
A West Midlands Fire Service spokeswoman said: ""We were called to Temple Street at 4.22pm this afternoon. We sent two fire engines from Aston and Ladywood to the scene.
""There are currently eight firefighters tackling an underground fire. The incident is ongoing.""
