Vauxhall Bridge was closed in both directions amid reports of a 'suspicious vehicle'.
Pedestrians were being stopped from crossing the major bridge in south London due to a police incident.
A vehicle was found abandoned just before 4pm and has been examined by specialist detectives.
The car was left positioned very close to the MI6 building and had its hazard lights on, My London reports.
A nearby theatre - 'Above The Stag' - has also been evacuated 'due to a suspect package' on the bridge.
South Western Railway said trains were not stopping at Vauxhall due to the incident near the station.
The scene has been described by a witness as ""worrying,"" adding that the area is ""swarming with police"". 
Police have since confirmed the vehicle has been deemed as non-suspicious following their investigation.
