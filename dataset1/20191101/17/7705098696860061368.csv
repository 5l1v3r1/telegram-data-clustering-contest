Emily Bett Rickards Will Return For Arrow Series Finale
01 Nov 2019, 17:37 by Robert Workman
The final season of Arrow is getting a return visit from one of its key stars. Stephen Amell has confirmed that Emily Bett Rickards will reprise her role as Felicity Smoak for the series finale.
On his Twitter account, Amell confirmed the news of her return. He also expressed his preference for fans to learn about the news directly “from us.”  You can see his message below.



RELATED: Stephen Amell Makes Big Promises About Crisis
Beckett first joined the series in its first season on a recurring basis, but she eventually became a series regular. Felicity became a key member of Team Arrow for several seasons, primarily due to her ongoing relationship with Amell’s Oliver Queen. Beckett departed the series following the conclusion of the seventh season. However, her departure with the Monitor gave Felicity a way to potentially return. 
Given the circumstances of Smoak’s departure, we wouldn’t rule out her making an appearance in Crisis On Infinite Earths. But that’s just speculation for now.
The series finale of Arrow will air early in 2020.
Are you glad that Beckett will be back as Felicity? Let us know in the comments below!
