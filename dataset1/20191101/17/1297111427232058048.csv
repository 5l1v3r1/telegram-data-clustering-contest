Riders' Dan Clark doesn't take O-line award for granted

Saskatchewan Roughriders centre Dan Clark prides himself on playing every game like it could be his last.
That sentiment took on a whole new meaning this spring when Clark was involved in a serious car accident that could have brought an end to his CFL career — or worse.
The 31-year-old Regina product was reminded of both scenarios on Wednesday when he was named the Riders’ most outstanding offensive lineman — an award that put the whole ordeal in perspective.
“It means a lot,” Clark said. “(It’s hard) to think I could have not been here playing football at all. This is very important to me (and) very important to my family.”
In fact, it’s important for reasons that transcend football.
“With the accident, I was thinking more along the lines of: ‘Am I going to be able to hug and kiss my wife and see my kids again?’ or ‘Am I going to be able to walk again?’ ” he continued. “Standing in the field that day beside the (wrecked) car and maybe waiting for STARS (Air Ambulance) to show up … a lot goes through your mind. Football was the least important thing in that moment.”
The single-vehicle crash occurred on May 7 while Clark was travelling down a gravel road on the way home from a community appearance in Cudworth. He was ejected from the car, which rolled several times before coming to a stop in an adjacent field.
“I can’t imagine how shook up he must have been afterwards,” said Riders guard Dakoda Shepley. “He showed me the pictures and told me the story. It just doesn’t sound like something you play a full football season after.
“If you’ve seen the pictures of the car after the wreck, it’s a wonder he’s even able to stand or is alive. And to come back and have as successful of a season as he’s had and also be nominated for most outstanding offensive lineman, it’s just incredible. It’s inspiring.”
Riders head coach Craig Dickenson thinks so, too.
“The fact that he was able to come away from it relatively healthy, it was kind of a miracle, to be quite honest with you,” Dickenson said. “And then to come back and play football and play at a high level like he did, I’ve gotta believe this might be his most rewarding year as a player.”
Not only did Clark return to practice less than a month after the accident, he has been one of the few constants on the O-line ever since. The eight-year veteran is the lone member of the unit to start all 17 games so far this season.
“It’s a heck of a story,” Dickenson said. “He was banged up early in camp but when he was ready to go he put the pads back on and got to work. He has had a great year. He’s not just the lineman of the year for us. He’s kind of a glue guy, a locker-room-guy-of-the-year too. He keeps that whole group together. That’s a credit to Dan and really the respect he has garnered year in and year out for the work he does.”
Clark’s perseverance paid off early this season when he played his 100th career CFL game. The milestone meant a little extra given what he went through before the season began, but it wasn’t his first taste of adversity.
“My journey hasn’t been always the easiest,” he said. “I always have that mindset that I can be replaced every single day that I walk in this building and I need to put the best step forward. Having the accident, it was one of those things that wasn’t going to hold me back. Yeah, it took me a little bit of time to get out on the field and show what I could do again, but it’s also that belief that I have in myself and the hard work that was instilled by my parents.
“I’m so appreciative of the chance that I get to come into (work) every day, especially growing up in Regina. I never take for granted being in this building.”
