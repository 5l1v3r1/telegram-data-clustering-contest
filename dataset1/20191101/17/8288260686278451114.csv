Wolverhampton Wanderers' parent company Fosun have bought the name of global travel group Thomas Cook for £11 million.
Fosun , who own tourism company Club Med, have bought the Thomas Cook branding along with the Casa Cook and Cook club names, report the BBC.

Fosun was the largest shareholder in Thomas Cook, whose collapse led to the biggest peacetime repatriation of Britons abroad who had become stranded as a result of the firm going bust.
