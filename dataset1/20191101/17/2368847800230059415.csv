全會公報重複55次 關鍵詞「堅持」映射習近平最大困境

01 Nov 2019, 17:27

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】中共19屆四中全會的公報，沒有重大人事變動和習近平黨內權力受損跡象。但是出現了「堅持社會主義制度」、「堅持黨領導一切」和「堅持公有制主體」等55個「堅持」。輿論認為，越強調「堅持」的東西說明越不穩。
四中全會公報「肯定」了中共政治局的「工作」，並再次強調「習核心」。另外，公報依然強調「推動構建人類命運共同體」和「毫不動搖鞏固和發展公有制經濟」，顯示習近平的所謂「政治路線」得以延續。北京獨立學者查建國對自由亞洲電台表示，公報沒有看到新內容，四中全會只是更加強化了習近平的黨內權威。
不過，公報中也透出了習近平面臨的危機。五千多字的公報中，「堅持馬克思主義基本原理」、「堅持黨的集中統一領導」、「堅持公有制為主體」及「堅持黨對軍隊的絕對領導」等等，「堅持」一詞不斷重複達55次。公報還強調，「堅持和完善中國特色社會主義制度、推進國家治理體系和治理能力現代化，是全黨的一項重大戰略任務」。
外界認為，這些不斷重複的「堅持」，和當局一直強調的「絕不改旗易幟」一樣，顯示中共的政治制度和統治權威已陷入「難以堅持」的空前危機。
時政評論員唐靖遠表示，習近平這次在黨內沒有遇到公開挑戰，但不等於沒有挑戰。同時，社會動盪也是他的最大困境之一，因為中共統治已經進入「越維穩越不穩」的惡性循環。
法廣文章指，公報通篇沒有提到經濟形勢和中美關係惡化，說明習近平正在這些問題上遭遇黨內壓力。中國歷史學者章立凡認為，公報顯示出中共內部存在巨大分歧。他分析，整個公報都在強調加強一黨專政，反映目前形勢存在強大的不安全感和危機，否則在中共內部團結、矛盾不尖銳的情況下，此次全會的主題應該是聚焦經濟。
當前美中貿易戰仍在延續，中國經濟形勢繼續惡化。中共近幾年外匯儲備不斷下降，加上外資大舉撤離，大量工人失業，使得控制社會避免動蕩已成為北京的當務之急。
北京文史學者張先生對自由亞洲分析，四中全會歸根結底是要用強化「黨領導一切」來鞏固其統治權，基本奏響了回歸文革狀態的號角。時評人劉銳紹對BBC表示，所謂「治理能力現代化」，其實是用經濟、政治、監控等手段保證中共執政。他認為，中共在政治上會進一步收緊，強化利用人臉識別和信用管理體系監控民眾。
張先生認為，將來無論是香港還是內地，當局都會採用「新疆模式」進行管控。他說，公報宣稱的所謂「取得巨大成功的治理模式」，可能包括控制國內民眾的「新疆模式」和控制其它國家的「一帶一路模式」。
另外，公報雖然沒有提及經濟和美中關係惡化，但對港澳問題有新的表述，或說明香港危機是這次「黨建」會議無法避開的重點。公報中稱，要依照《憲法》和《基本法》對港澳「實行管治」，並要求「建立健全特別行政區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制」。
章立凡認為，這些說法應該是首次出現，說明中共可能要違背所謂「一國兩制」，把中共的那套所謂「法治」延伸到港澳。香港中文大學客座教授林和立則認為，習近平這次沒有拿出推動香港政治改革的途徑，反而更加強調所謂「國家安全」，說明北京對香港沒有妥協的跡象，港人與北京之間的深層次矛盾將會加劇。

The plenary bulletin was repeated 55 times. Key words ""persistence"" mapping Xi Jinping's biggest dilemma

01 Nov 2019, 17:27

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 01, 2019] The communique of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee did not have major personnel changes and signs of impaired power in Xi Jinping. However, there have been 55 ""persistences"" such as ""adhering to the socialist system"", ""holding on the party to lead everything"" and ""maintaining the main body of public ownership."" Public opinion believes that the more emphasis on ""persistence"", the more unstable it is.
The Fourth Plenary Session of the General Assembly ""affirmed"" the ""work"" of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party and once again emphasized the ""center of learning."" In addition, the communiqué still emphasizes ""promoting the construction of a community of human destiny"" and ""unswervingly consolidating and developing the public sector of the economy"", showing that Xi Jinping's so-called ""political line"" can be continued. Beijing independent scholar Cha Jianguo told Free Asia Radio that the communique did not see new content, and the Fourth Plenary Session only strengthened Xi Jinping’s party authority.
However, the communiqué also revealed the crisis facing Xi Jinping. In the communique of more than 5,000 words, ""adhere to the basic principles of Marxism"", ""adhere to the party's centralized and unified leadership"", ""adhere to the public ownership as the main body"" and ""adhere to the party's absolute leadership over the military"", etc., the word ""persistence"" continues Repeated up to 55 times. The communique also stressed that ""holding and improving the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity is a major strategic task for the entire party.""
The outside world believes that these repeated ""persistences"", like the ""no change of flags"" that the authorities have always emphasized, show that the CCP's political system and ruling authority have fallen into an unprecedented crisis of ""difficult to persist.""
Political commentator Tang Jingyuan said that Xi Jinping did not encounter open challenges in the party this time, but it does not mean that there is no challenge. At the same time, social unrest is also one of his greatest difficulties, because the CCP rule has entered a vicious circle of ""more stability and more instability.""
According to the law, the article does not mention the economic situation and the deterioration of Sino-US relations, indicating that Xi Jinping is experiencing party pressure on these issues. Chinese historical scholar Zhang Lifan believes that the communique shows that there are huge differences within the CCP. He analyzed that the entire communique is emphasizing the strengthening of one-party dictatorship, reflecting the current situation of strong insecurity and crisis. Otherwise, under the circumstance of CCP internal unity and contradictions, the theme of this plenary session should focus on the economy.
The current US-China trade war is still continuing and the Chinese economic situation continues to deteriorate. In recent years, the CCP’s foreign exchange reserves have been declining, and with the large-scale withdrawal of foreign capital, a large number of workers have lost their jobs, making it a top priority for Beijing to control the society to avoid turmoil.
Mr. Zhang, a scholar of Beijing literature and history, analyzed Free Asia. In the final analysis, the Fourth Plenary Session was to strengthen the ""party leadership"" to consolidate its rule, and basically played a clarion call back to the Cultural Revolution. The commentator Liu Ruishao told the BBC that the so-called ""modernization of governance capacity"" actually uses economic, political, and monitoring means to ensure that the CCP is in power. He believes that the CCP will further tighten its politics and strengthen the use of face recognition and credit management systems to monitor the public.
Mr Cheung believes that in the future, both Hong Kong and the Mainland will adopt the ""Xinjiang Model"" for control. He said that the so-called ""great success of the governance model"" claimed by the communique may include controlling the ""Xinjiang model"" of the domestic people and controlling the ""One Belt, One Road Model"" of other countries.
In addition, although the communique did not mention the deterioration of the economy and US-China relations, it has a new expression on the Hong Kong and Macao issue, or that the Hong Kong crisis is the focus that the ""Party Building"" meeting cannot avoid. The communique stated that it is necessary to ""administer governance"" to Hong Kong and Macao in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law, and to ""establish a sound legal system and enforcement mechanism for special administrative regions to safeguard national security.""
Zhang Lifan believes that these statements should be the first to appear, indicating that the CCP may have to violate the so-called ""one country, two systems"" and extend the so-called ""rule of law"" of the CCP to Hong Kong and Macao. Lin Heli, a visiting professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, believes that Xi Jinping did not come up with ways to promote political reform in Hong Kong. Instead, he emphasized the so-called ""national security"", indicating that Beijing has no signs of compromise for Hong Kong, and the deep level between Hong Kong people and Beijing. Contradictions will intensify.
