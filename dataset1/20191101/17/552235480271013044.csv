Cops are appealing for information after two shops were ram-raided within a mile of each other in the early hours of the morning.
A Scotmid store and a Londis/BP filling station on Mearns Road in Clarkston were targeted after a car was driven into them.
Officers from Police Scotland were called at around 5.20am after reports a Peugeot car reversed into the front of the Co-op causing extensive damage.
A short time later the same vehicle backed into the front of the filling station then made off.
