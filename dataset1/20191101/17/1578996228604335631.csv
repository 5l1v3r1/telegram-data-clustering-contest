Ariana Grande's Twilight Zone Halloween Party Had Lizzo, Nicki Minaj, Blackpink's Jennie, and Piggy Smallz

Ariana Grande fully leaned into her Twilight Zone Halloween costume, based off the 1960s series' ""Eye of the Beholder"" episode, and had a Halloween party themed off the show last night. Some incredible company celebrated with her: Lizzo, Nicki Minaj, and Blackpink's Jennie were among the celebs there.
Ariana has collaborated with Lizzo (they just released a remix of ""Good as Hell"") and Nicki Minaj. Ariana hinted in July that she'd love to collaborate with k-pop group Blackpink, and the girls attended her Coachella show earlier this year.
Ariana's brother Frankie shared a shot of him and Ariana together, Ariana channeling The Twilight Zone again and Frankie as the Ambassador of Mars from Mars Attacks!.



Nicki, meanwhile, shared a shot of her and Ariana from the party's photo booth with Justine Peacock and film producer Thembi Banks. Of course there was a photo booth with a personalized party logo; practically every big celeb party has one. Kendall Jenner's Halloween party that same night had one too.



Lizzo was at Ari's fest as a DNA test, and she had a moment checking Ariana's famed pet pig Piggy Smallz's breath. Apparently it smells like syrup, so the pig is thriving:



Jennie appeared at the party dressed as Alice in Wonderland with Ariana's close friend Alexa Luria, who was Rapunzel. (Jennie was also seen at Kendall's party.) Luria posted a colored shot of the party's decor too:

Grande kept all her photos from the party in black and white primarily, since The Twilight Zone was filmed in black and white. She had a scary and not-scary side to her party and also had a live band performing:

Frankie and Victoria (who was dressed as Jessica Rabbit) shared some colored glimpses from the bar and party's scarier rooms.

Kudos to Ariana for outdoing everyone's Halloween parties except for maybe Kylie Jenner's, although that's fully debatable.
