Weekly roast of garbage product design
01 Nov 2019, 17:41 by Mark Frauenfelder
The design website Core77 has a weekly feature called Design Roast, devoted to making fun of bad industrial design. My ""favorite"" this time around is a portable leather chess board with rubber pieces that you are meant to wrap around stones you gather before you can play.
This is a leather chess board that comes with silicone bands delineating the pieces; you're meant to find and gather rocks to tie the bands around, in order to complete the pieces (I'm not kidding). I'd like to see a Checkers variant of this--it would come with the board, a sausage, a zucchini, and a chef's knife.
