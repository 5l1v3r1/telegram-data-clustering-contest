Police in Detroit are on the hunt Friday for a suspect who reportedly shot and killed a father of 10 at a gas station while wearing a clown mask on Halloween night.
The gunman – who has not been identified – was wearing a clown mask with a red nose when he walked into a Citgo station Thursday evening, approached a customer and fired a round into the back of his head, investigators told WJBK.
The shooter and another individual then fled the store. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene.
