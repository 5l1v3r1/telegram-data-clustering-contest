A charity has shared a heartbreaking photo of a little girl in a princess dress queueing for food on Halloween night.
Feed Our Homeless in Dublin, Ireland, posted pictures of people lining up to get a meal at their food station yesterday evening.
Huge queues of homeless people waited in the lashing rain for hot food - as well as support from the charity.
Among those waiting, a young girl was photographed in what appears to be a fancy dress princess gown with a coat over the top.
Next to her stood an even younger boy also looking to be fed.
