But they are, if the report is to be believed, going to soften the blow by sending young winger Nathan Holland to West Brom to take Diangan a's place.
The report claims a West Ham source has described the exchange as a 'live' option.
Holland is a 21-year-old wide man who has been with West Ham since 2017, when he arrived from Everton.
The youngster was also an England under-19 international. He is yet to register a senior appearance in professional football.
