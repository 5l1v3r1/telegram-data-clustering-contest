菲律賓爆小兒麻痺疫情 未滿6個月寶寶別去

（中央社記者張茗喧台北1日電）菲律賓因小兒麻痺疫苗接種率過低，9月間發現有3起幼童遭疫苗裡的病毒感染病例。疾管署呼籲，家有未滿6個月寶寶或還沒接種第3劑疫苗的幼童，暫緩前往菲律賓，避免感染。
衛生福利部疾病管制署今天發布新聞稿指出，菲律賓9月19日發生19年來首例小兒麻痺症病例，至今累計3例，均為「第2型疫苗衍生株小兒麻痺病毒」感染引發急性肢體麻痺，患者均未接種過小兒麻痺疫苗。
疾管署副署長羅一鈞受訪時表示，小兒麻痺疫苗是口服疫苗，過去俗稱沙賓疫苗，疫苗內含減少毒力的活病毒，若整體族群接種率低，活的病毒可能由接種疫苗者感染給其他沒有接種疫苗者，突變後進一步傳播出去，因此稱為「疫苗衍生株小兒麻痺病毒」。
羅一鈞說，由於菲律賓幼兒小兒麻痺疫苗覆蓋率僅66%，加上監測系統不佳、大量海外移工及衛生條件差，才會釀成這次小兒麻痺疫情。
他表示，台灣小兒麻痺疫苗接種率雖達98%以上，但因該疫苗必須接種3劑才具有99%保護力，接種2劑僅有90%保護力，若是家裡有6個月以下寶寶或是還未接種第3劑疫苗的幼童，建議避免帶孩子前往菲律賓，等到打完第3劑至少2週後再前往。
羅一鈞強調，小兒麻痺病毒主要透過糞口途徑傳染，感染者在暴露病毒36小時後可在咽喉分泌物中檢測到病毒，72小時後糞便也開始帶有病毒，病毒在喉部約可存活1週，在糞便中約可存活3至6週或更久。
羅一鈞說，90%以上感染者症狀不明顯或無症狀，少數會有發燒、頭痛、倦怠、噁心、嘔吐等輕微症狀，1至2%的人會出現無菌性腦膜炎，但幼兒是小兒麻痺症重症高危險族群，一旦感染很可能導致肢體癱瘓，不可不慎。（編輯：吳協昌）1081101

Philippine polio plague epidemic
01 Nov 2019, 17:13 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Zhang Wei, Taipei, 1st) The vaccination rate of polio in the Philippines was too low. In September, three young children were found to be infected with the virus in the vaccine. The Department of Diseases has called for a child who has had a baby for less than 6 months or has not been vaccinated with a third dose of vaccine to stay in the Philippines to avoid infection.
The Department of Health and Welfare's Disease Control Agency issued a press release today stating that the first case of polio in 19 years in the Philippines occurred on September 19, and three cases have been accumulated so far, all of which are caused by ""type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus"" infection. None of the patients had been vaccinated against polio.
Luo Yizhen, deputy director of the Department of Disease Control, said that the polio vaccine is an oral vaccine. In the past, it was commonly known as the Sabin vaccine. The vaccine contains a live virus that reduces virulence. If the overall population vaccination rate is low, the live virus may be infected by the vaccinated person. For other people who are not vaccinated, the mutation is further spread out, so it is called ""vaccine-derived poliovirus"".
Luo Yizhen said that because the pediatric polio vaccine coverage rate in the Philippines is only 66%, coupled with poor monitoring system, a large number of overseas migration and poor sanitation, this polio epidemic will be caused.
He said that although the vaccination rate of polio in Taiwan is more than 98%, it is only 99% protective because the vaccine must be inoculated with 3 doses, and only 90% of the vaccination is only 90%. If the baby has less than 6 months at home, Young children who have not been vaccinated with the third dose of vaccine are advised to avoid taking their children to the Philippines and wait until after the third dose has been taken for at least 2 weeks.
Luo Yizhen emphasized that poliovirus is mainly transmitted through the faecal-oral route. The infected person can detect the virus in the throat secretion after 36 hours of exposure to the virus. After 72 hours, the feces also begin to carry the virus, and the virus can survive for about 1 week in the throat. It can survive for about 3 to 6 weeks or more in feces.
Luo Yizhen said that more than 90% of infected people have no obvious symptoms or no symptoms. A few have mild symptoms such as fever, headache, burnout, nausea and vomiting. 1 to 2% of people will develop aseptic meningitis, but young children are polio. Severely high-risk groups, once infected, it is likely to cause paralysis of the limbs, not careless. (Editor: Wu Xiechang) 1081101
