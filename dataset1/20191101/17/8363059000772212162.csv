WhatsApp Has Fingerprint Unlock on Android Phones Now
01 Nov 2019, 17:30 by Tegan Jones
Earlier this year WhatsApp introduced Face ID and fingerprint unlock for iPhone users. Now it has bestowed biometric security on Android as well.
WhatsApp announced the rollout on a blog post overnight, stating that supported Android devices would now allow for Fingerprint ID.
You can toggle it one by going to Settings > Account > Privacy > Fingerprint Lock.
You also have a number of options to choose from when it comes to locking the app - immediately, 1 minute and 30 minutes. After your chosen lock time has passed you'll need to scan your fingerprint again to unlock the app.
There is also an option to show content in notifications.
Fingerprint unlock is available on compatable Android devices from today. It's unclear when Face ID for WhatsApp will be coming to Android devices. [WhatsApp]
