2 of 20Spooky scenesThe event took place, as ever, at London's beloved spit 'n' sawdust venue The Shacklewell Arms, in Dalston.



3 of 20Making up is so very hard to do (but the results are spectacular)This edition had a special Halloween theme, so we named it Ghouls To The Front because we're hilarious like that. It was, it must be said, a strange night.



4 of 20Fresh from the scare farmThe audience really went for it with the costumes. Special props to the person who came dressed as Black Mirror's Ashley O - very apt indeed. Although Poppy - basically the real-life Ashley O - reckons she's never seen it.Image credit: Jenn Five



5 of 20It’s AMA!The first act on was rising London-based R&B star AMA, a recent signing to Dirty Hit, home to last week's NME cover star Beabadoobee, plus The 1975, Wolf Alice and No Rome. Best known for its stable of indie artists, AMA marks the label's first venture into full-blown R&B.Image credit: Jenn Five



6 of 20MoodAMA told us she hates scary stuff, so came as a not-very-terrifying alien instead.



7 of 20Ama performs AMAzinglyAMA just released her debut EP, 'Screenluv', which is named for how she - a self confessed typical Gen Z girl - lives her life through her phone. She and her DJ played each of the EP's tracks in a set that had the entire crowd moving.



8 of 20Poppy arrivesPoppy arrived at 9pm for her PA and DJ set. Now, one thing Poppy fans know is this: you never quite know what to expect from her. Unless you were expecting her to play an hour of banging techno interspersed with dialogue from horror films while casually reading a graphic novel handed to her by a fan.

10 of 20Here’s Poppy turning the lens on her fansThe LA-based artist's latest work has seen her reject the pure pop sound of 2018’s ‘Am I A Girl’ in favour of heavy metal. Recent singles ‘Concrete’ and ‘I Disagree’ have blended crunching riffs with candy-sweet pop choruses and deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply disturbing lyrics. Think: a Nine Inch Nail piercing a pink marshmallow.Image credit: Jenn Five

12 of 20Poppy on the ones and twosPoppy recently told NME her best friend is her hairless cat, whom she lives with in Los Angeles. A fan gifted Poppy a model of a sphinx cat, which she placed atop the DJ booth for the duration of the set. It added a touch of class because - fun fact - NME only spent £24 on the halloween decorations.

14 of 20Poppy’s very own reading festival, part twoAnd here's Poppy, er, reading her book.



15 of 20Poppy’s very own reading festival, part threeAnd here she is reading the book again, which she did for about 20 minutes in total. You know when someone repeats a joke and it's not funny for a bit, then they repeat it again and again and after a while it becomes incredibly funny but you can't really explain why? That's what this was like.



16 of 20What is happening?Remember when we said it was a strange night (in the best possible way)? First up, there was a rumour going round that it wasn't actually Poppy, but someone who looks exactly-the-goddamned-same wearing makeup. Though the DNA test is pending, we can confirm that Poppy herself, hallowed be her name, was on stage at the Shack.



17 of 20Talk about: Pop(py) musicSecondly, the performance sparked a wider debate about the nature of live entertainment. Was it a situationist prank? A satirical comment on celebrity DJ sets? A hint at what a 3am sesh at Poppy's gaff is like? A woman standing on stage in a latex harlequin costume taking a moment to catch up on contemporary literature? All of these things? None of these things? You decide.



18 of 20Top of the PoppiesPoppy's set included dialogue from the film It - the original Tim Curry version, we think. The performer is clearly a fan of the horror genre. Her YouTube videos are often as disturbing as they are mesmerising. Think of her as a pop star invented by Stanley Kubrick and you're halfway there.



19 of 20Poppy and pappyPoppy's new album, ‘I Disagree’, is released early next year. You can read all about it next week in a very special NME feature - so stay tuned.



20 of 20Rock on, PoppyPoppy, we salute you.
