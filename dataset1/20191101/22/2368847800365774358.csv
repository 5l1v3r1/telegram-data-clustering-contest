美前議長:中共是最大威脅 蓬佩奧:必須正面應對

01 Nov 2019, 22:43

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】週二（10月29日），前美國國會眾議院議長金里奇呼籲美國認清中共本質是極權體制，也是美國最大威脅。次日，美國務卿蓬佩奧表示，美國已經認清了中共對美國的敵意，以及美中意識形態的根本對立，將正面迎擊中共。

金里奇：中共本質是極權體制 美國必須認清威脅

當地時間週二下午，金里奇（Newt Gingrich）在南加大舉行了新書演講會，呼籲美國上下應該認清中共政權是「黨在國上」的極權體制，對內使用監控和暴力來維護其獨裁統治，對外則不斷擴張勢力，消滅批評聲音。
他在演講中指出，中共是列寧主義極權政體，信奉的是極權專制，不允許有不一樣的聲音，新疆、西藏和法輪功等有宗教信仰的團體都是中共殘酷迫害的對象。
為了避免極權統治被推翻，中共在國際社會上曾極力掩飾。當初鄧小平的經濟改革給西方社會造成錯覺，讓美國政界誤以為中共會通過經濟改革向民主社會轉型，但上演的卻是農夫與蛇的故事。中共利用西方的幫助獲取了巨大財富，不但得以把極權統治現代化，還在悄無聲息的情況下，一步步對外搶奪地盤，滲透和侵蝕自由世界，特別是中共對信息的過濾和西方社會在中共威逼利誘下的自我審查。
金里奇呼籲美國意識到當前美中角力的重要性，認清中共的極權性質，切莫忽視中共畫皮下的對與美國及整個普世價值的威脅，否則後果將不堪設想。【視頻報導：前國會議長南加大演講：中共是美國最大威脅】

蓬佩奧：美國將與中共意識形態正面對決

次日晚，蓬佩奧（Mike Pompeo）也在華府哈德遜研究所發表了一個重磅演講。這次演講，被視為上週美國副總統彭斯（Mike Pence）的美中關係講話之後，對中共的又一次重擊。蓬佩奧事後遭中共外交部和《人民日報》等機構連番謾罵。
蓬佩奧在演講中說，美國過去曾經容忍中共的威脅，淡化美中意識形態分歧。但如今美國已經認清了中共對美國敵意有多深，以及美中意識形態上的本質對立，美國將正面迎擊中共的挑戰，並呼籲世界共同對抗中共。
蓬佩奧說，美國長期以來珍惜與中國人民的友誼，但中共政府和中國人民並不是一回事。中共想方設法為美國和世界製造難題，全世界必須合力共同對抗這些挑戰。
他提到，美國數十年來不惜犧牲美國的價值觀、西方的民主、安全和正確的判斷力，容忍並鼓勵了中共的崛起。為了所謂「和平解決台灣問題」，美國還降低了對台灣的待遇。當天安門大屠殺和中國其它重大侵犯人權事件發生後，美方也常常迴避直接談論中國的人權問題和美國價值觀，試圖淡化美中之間在意識形態上的分歧。
蓬佩奧說，「今天，我們終於意識到共產黨對美國及美國價值觀懷有多大敵意。」
他表示，中共盜竊知識產權削弱美國製造業；要求美國企業自我審查，威脅美國自由；通過發展不對稱武器威脅美國國家安全，北京還以脅迫作為工具，威脅所有民主國家。此外，中共還通過在南中國海，以及台灣海峽等地區法外領土以及主權認領等方式，威脅自由和開放的國際秩序。
他說，中共一直挑戰美國和世界，川普（特朗普）政府認為必須迎擊中共的挑戰，「我們迎接來自中國（中共）的挑戰，用時代要求的方式」。
他表示，「我們有這樣的認知，都是因為有川普總統的領導。」川普從上任第一天起，就對中共提出警告。忽視中美之間的根本差異以及這些差異對美國國家安全的影響，已經不再現實了。忽略美中政治系統之間的根本差異，以及制度差異對美國國安影響，再也不是實際之舉。
蓬佩奧還說，中共是馬列主義政黨，不但注重「鬥爭」，同時還尋求支配全世界，「我們只需要聽聽中共領導人的講話就能意識到這一點」，而且中共迅速增強的軍力「遠遠超過了自衛的需求」。「北京還將其鄰國和其他國家納入中國國家主導的經濟模式，經常通過賄賂達成交易……經常使許多人陷入債務泥潭，並威脅到他們的主權。」蓬佩奧指的是中共「一帶一路」項目對周邊國家的傷害。
蓬佩奧強調，中國人民不想要共產主義制度。
「中共政府踐踏了中國公民最基本的人權」，蓬佩奧說，我們在香港和新疆都看到了這一點。他還表示，中共政權是一種馬列主義的統治制度，每個人必須按照共產黨上層的意願來思考和行動。這不是中國人民想要的未來，熱愛自由的所有中國民眾都不想要這樣的模式。
蓬佩奧表示，造成當前局面的不僅僅是北京，以前的美國政界也都低估了中共對美國的威脅。他批評自尼克松政府以來的美國政府，一直漠視美中制度的基本差異與奢望中共進行改革，但如今的川普政府會直言指出中共的行為、特別是經濟議題，但也不避諱安全層面。
他說，川普政府從來不畏懼與中共抗衡，「我們並不想這樣，是被中國（中共）所逼」。
他同時也強調，美國並沒有主動尋求與中共對抗，而是希望看到一個透明的、由市場競爭主導的互惠互利體制，而有望即將簽署的美中第一階段貿易協議就是第一步。「對此我表示樂觀，協議是個好東西，說明我們可以相互合作。」
他重申，美國希望中國強大富強，人民真正享有民主和自由。
最後蓬佩奧表示，川普總統闡明，美中關係是美國未來50年到100年的核心關係，政府仍在尋求正確的策略和戰略。
蓬佩奧在講話中還強調，今後幾個月，他還將發表多次演講，談及美中之間的意識形態和價值觀之爭、中共情報機關在全球拓張影響力、北京的不公正經貿政策等議題。【視頻報導：蓬佩奧哈德遜演講：美國正面臨來自中共的挑戰】
蓬佩奧的演講，是川普政府最近一次對中共發表鷹派言論。上週，美國副總統彭斯也曾在哈德遜研究所發表對華政策演講，抨擊了中共在人權、貿易、擴大全球影響力方面的手段。

Former US Speaker: The CCP is the biggest threat. Pompeo: Must respond positively

01 Nov 2019, 22:43

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] On Tuesday (October 29), former US House Speaker Gingrich called on the United States to recognize that the CCP is essentially a totalitarian system and the greatest threat to the United States. The next day, US Secretary of State Pompeo said that the United States has already recognized the CCP’s hostility towards the United States and the fundamental opposition between the US and China’s ideology and will face the CCP positively.

Gingrich: The CCP is essentially a totalitarian system. The United States must recognize the threat.

On Tuesday afternoon local time, Newt Gingrich held a new book speech in South Africa, calling on the United States to recognize that the Chinese Communist regime is a ""party in the country"" totalitarian system, using internal monitoring and violence to maintain Its dictatorship, the external expansion of the forces, to eliminate the voice of criticism.
In his speech, he pointed out that the CCP is a Leninist totalitarian regime and believes in totalitarian autocracy. It does not allow for a different voice. Groups with religious beliefs such as Xinjiang, Tibet, and Falun Gong are the targets of the CCP's cruel persecution.
In order to avoid the overthrow of totalitarian rule, the CCP has tried its best to conceal it in the international community. At the beginning, Deng Xiaoping’s economic reforms caused illusions in Western society, and the American political circles mistakenly thought that the CCP would transform into a democratic society through economic reforms, but the story of farmers and snakes was staged. The CCP has used the help of the West to gain enormous wealth. Not only has it been able to modernize the totalitarian rule, but it has also sneaked into the territory, infiltrating and eroding the free world, especially the CCP’s filtering of information and the Western society in the CCP. Self-censorship under the coercion.
Gingrich called on the United States to realize the importance of the current US-China wrangling, to recognize the CCP’s totalitarian nature, and not to ignore the threat posed by the CCP under the skin of the United States and the entire universal values, or the consequences would be unimaginable.

Pompeo: The United States will confront the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party

The next evening, Mike Pompeo also delivered a keynote speech at the Hudson Institute in Washington. This speech was seen as another blow to the CCP after the speech of US-China relations by US Vice President Mike Pence last week. After the incident, Pompeo was repeatedly beaten by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Chinese Communist Party and the People’s Daily.
In his speech, Pompeo said that the United States used to tolerate the threat of the CCP and dilute the differences between the US and China. But now that the United States has recognized the CCP’s hostility towards the United States and the ideological opposition between the United States and China, the United States will face the challenges of the CCP and call on the world to fight against the CCP.
Pompeo said that the United States has long cherished friendship with the Chinese people, but the Chinese government and the Chinese people are not the same thing. The CCP is trying to create problems for the United States and the world, and the world must work together to confront these challenges.
He mentioned that the United States has tolerated and encouraged the rise of the CCP by sacrificing American values, Western democracy, security and correct judgment for decades. For the so-called ""peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue,"" the United States has also reduced its treatment of Taiwan. After the Anmen massacre and other major human rights violations in China, the US often avoided talking directly about China's human rights issues and American values, trying to dilute the ideological differences between the United States and China.
Pompeo said, ""Today, we finally realized how hostile the Communist Party is to American and American values.""
He said that the CCP’s theft of intellectual property rights weakened US manufacturing; it required US companies to self-censor and threaten US freedom; and by developing asymmetric weapons to threaten US national security, Beijing also used coercion as a tool to threaten all democracies. In addition, the CCP threatens the free and open international order by means of extraterritorial territories in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, as well as sovereign claims.
He said that the CCP has always challenged the United States and the world. The Trump administration believes that it must meet the challenges of the CCP. ""We welcome the challenges from China (the CCP) and use the methods demanded by the times.""
He said, ""We have such a perception because of the leadership of President Trump."" Trump warned the CCP from the first day of his appointment. Neglecting the fundamental differences between China and the United States and the impact of these differences on US national security is no longer a reality. It is no longer a practical matter to ignore the fundamental differences between the US and China political systems and the impact of institutional differences on the US national security.
Pompeo also said that the CCP is a Marxist-Leninist party that not only pays attention to ""struggle"" but also seeks to dominate the world. ""We only need to listen to the speeches of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party to realize this,"" and the CCP's rapidly increasing military strength. ""There is far more demand for self-defense."" ""Beijing has also incorporated its neighbors and other countries into China's state-led economic model, often through bribery to reach deals... often causing many people to fall into debt and threaten their sovereignty."" Pompeo refers to the CCP's All the way to the damage of the surrounding countries.
Pompeo emphasized that the Chinese people do not want the communist system.
""The Chinese government has trampled on the most basic human rights of Chinese citizens."" Pompeo said that we have seen this in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. He also said that the CCP regime is a Marxist-Leninist ruling system, and everyone must think and act in accordance with the will of the upper echelons of the Communist Party. This is not the future that the Chinese people want. All Chinese people who love freedom do not want this model.
Pompeo said that it is not just Beijing that has caused the current situation. The former US political circles also underestimated the CCP’s threat to the United States. He criticized the US government since the Nixon administration, has always ignored the basic differences between the US and China systems and hoped that the CCP will carry out reforms. However, today's Trump administration will bluntly point out the behavior of the CCP, especially economic issues, but it does not avoid the security dimension.
He said that the Trump administration has never feared to compete with the CCP. ""We don't want this, it is forced by China (the CCP).""
He also stressed that the United States did not actively seek confrontation with the CCP, but hoped to see a transparent, market-driven, mutually beneficial system, and the US-China first-phase trade agreement, which is expected to be signed, is the first step. ""I am optimistic about this. The agreement is a good thing, indicating that we can cooperate with each other.""
He reiterated that the United States hopes that China will be strong and strong, and that the people truly enjoy democracy and freedom.
In the end, Pompeo said that President Trump stated that US-China relations are the core relationship of the United States in the next 50 to 100 years, and the government is still seeking the right strategy and strategy.
In his speech, Pompeo also stressed that in the next few months, he will also deliver many speeches on the dispute between ideology and values between the United States and China, the influence of the Chinese intelligence agencies on global expansion, and the injustice in Beijing. Economic and trade policies and other issues. [Video Report: Pompey O'Hadeson's Speech: The United States is Faced with Challenges from the CCP]
Pompeo’s speech was the last time the Trump administration issued a hawkish speech to the CCP. Last week, US Vice President Burns also gave a speech on China policy at the Hudson Institute, criticizing the CCP's means of human rights, trade, and expanding global influence.
