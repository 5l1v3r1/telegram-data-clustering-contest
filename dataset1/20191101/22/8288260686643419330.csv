Aston Villa are back where they belong and in the top flight of English football.
Villa returned to the Premier League with Dean Smith at the helm last season after progressing through the Championship play-offs.
The opening ten league games of the season have seen the Lions rack up 11 points from a possible 30 on offer, and currently lie in 15th place in the table.
After winning two games on the spin, Dean Smith's men were beaten 3-0 at The Etihad Stadium as Manchester City made their second half pressure pay.
 
Liverpool are up next for Villa, who progressed through to the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night beating Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-1.
That defeat at City has altered the market for relegation odds and we've compiled the latest below...
Norwich City - 8/15
Watford - 10/11
Newcastle United - 21/20
Southampton - 2/1

Aston Villa - 12/5

Sheffield United - 10/3
