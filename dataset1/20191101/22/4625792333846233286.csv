‘Oh no’: Trump mocks Beto O’Rourke for dropping out of 2020 race
01 Nov 2019, 22:11 by Madison Dibble
President Trump used Beto O’Rourke’s words from the beginning of his 2020 campaign to mock the end of his presidential bid.
In a celebratory tweet, Trump pointed to O’Rourke’s Vanity Fair campaign launch and scoffed at his campaign-ending announcement.
""Oh no, Beto just dropped out of race for President despite him saying he was 'born for this.' I don’t think so!"" he tweeted Friday.



When O’Rourke announced earlier this year he was running, he claimed he felt he was destined to be president, saying, “Man, I’m just born to be in it.”
He later backtracked on this campaign talking point, saying, “Nobody is born to be president of the United States of America — least of all me.""
He announced the end of his campaign on Friday, saying, ""Thank you for making this campaign possible, and for continuing to believe that we can turn this moment of great peril into a moment of great promise for America and the world.""
