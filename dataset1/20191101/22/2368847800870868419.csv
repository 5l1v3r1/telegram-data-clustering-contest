FBI局長:反情報特別關注中共 大選或受其干擾

01 Nov 2019, 22:37

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】美國聯邦調查局（FBI）局長雷（Christopher Wray）週三（10月30日）在國會作證時表示，FBI在反情報（反間諜）方面特別關注中共，並提醒美國要警惕中共傳播假消息，干擾明年總統大選。
雷當時對美國眾議院國土安全委員會表示，FBI已經調查了一千多起與中國有關的技術盜竊，這不僅僅涉及大城市，也影響到了中心地帶。他還說，中共正在使用一套不斷擴大的「非傳統方法」，使用各種合法和非法的手段，包括資助研究和網絡入侵，來竊取美國的商業秘密，還帶來了各種供應鏈的威脅。
今年4月，雷也曾在智庫美國外交關係委員會表示，來自中共的經濟間諜活動是美國當前最廣泛、最嚴峻的間諜威脅，因為中共率先採用了「全社會的方式」，正通過各種各樣的公司、大學和組織，通過情報機構、國企和私企，通過研究生、學者以及各種為中共工作的人，「儘其所能的盜竊我們的創造」。
美國智庫企業研究所高級研究員庫珀（Zack Cooper）對《美國之音》表示，多年來，中國一直是竊取美國知識產權最多的國家，這讓美國每年損失2,000億到3,000多億美元。過去5年裏，美國一直在努力說服中共領導人停止盜竊，但情況依然沒有改變。
雷還在聽證會上表示，中共可能會通過傳播虛假信息，影響明年的美國大選，美國必須保持警惕。他說，中共、伊朗和朝鮮對惡意影響外國選舉「十分感興趣」。美國國土安全部代理部長麥卡倫南（Kevin McAleenan）也作證說，美國面臨潛在的選舉安全威脅。
9月23日，《華盛頓郵報》發表社論指，美國擔心俄羅斯介入大選，但「經驗更豐富的選手」也不會袖手旁觀。中國龐大的五毛大軍可以證明，中共比俄羅斯更早開始操控網上輿論。香港的民主抗爭和明年1月台灣中華民國大選，都已成為中共在海外操控輿論的對象，北京也可能在美國開闢新戰線。
日前，中共封殺NBA和《南方公園》等一系列操作，已經成為北京「審查」美國國內輿論的明證，也引起了美國朝野的特別警惕。8月，美國推特關閉了攻擊香港反送中民眾的20萬個帳號，並指這些攻擊是「受政府控制」的有組織行動。
去年，美國總統川普（特朗普）也曾指控中共干預美國中期選舉。當時，中共黨媒在美國愛荷華州最大的地方報紙購買版面攻擊川普，為北京干預美國選舉提供了證據。
除了操控輿論，中共多年來對美國進行政治滲透，對美國選舉的影響更為深遠。台媒曾指，操控美國政客和華人團隊進行「反美」活動，早已是中共駐美外交官的「日常工作」。而中共利用經濟利益收買美國政界和商界，培植親共勢力，對美國政治殺傷力更大。
美中貿易戰中，白宮前戰略顧問班農一再指責美國華爾街為北京輸送資金。已成為川普潛在競選對手的前副總統拜登，近期則被揭露其子和中國公司存在利益聯繫。

Director of the FBI: Counter-intelligence pays special attention to or is disturbed by the CCP election

01 Nov 2019, 22:37

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director Christopher Wray said in a testimony on Wednesday (October 30) that the FBI is particularly concerned about counterintelligence (anti-spyware). The CCP also reminded the United States to be alert to the CCP’s dissemination of false news and to interfere with the presidential election next year.
Ray told the US House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee that the FBI had investigated more than a thousand Chinese-related technology thefts, not only in large cities, but also in the central area. He also said that the CCP is using an ever-expanding ""non-traditional approach"" to use a variety of legal and illegal means, including funding research and network intrusion, to steal US trade secrets, and also pose various supply chain threats.
In April this year, Lei also said in the US Foreign Relations Committee of the think tank that the economic espionage from the CCP is the most widespread and serious espionage threat in the United States, because the CCP has taken the lead in adopting the ""system of the whole society"" and is adopting various Companies, universities, and organizations, through intelligence agencies, state-owned enterprises, and private companies, through graduate students, scholars, and people who work for the CCP, ""do everything we can to steal our creation.""
Zack Cooper, a senior researcher at the American Institute of Think Tanks, told VOA that for many years China has been stealing the most intellectual property in the United States, which has cost the United States $200 billion to more than $300 billion a year. In the past five years, the United States has been trying to persuade the CCP leaders to stop theft, but the situation has not changed.
Lei also said at the hearing that the CCP may transmit vigilance by affecting the US elections next year by spreading false information. He said that the CCP, Iran and North Korea are ""very interested"" in maliciously affecting foreign elections. US Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan also testified that the United States faces potential electoral security threats.
On September 23, the ""Washington Post"" published an editorial that the United States is worried that Russia will intervene in the general election, but ""experienced players"" will not stand idly by. China's huge Wu Mao army can prove that the CCP began to manipulate online public opinion earlier than Russia. Hong Kong's democratic struggle and the Republic of China's general election in January next year have become the targets of the CCP's manipulation of public opinion overseas. Beijing may also open up new fronts in the United States.
A few days ago, the CCP’s ban on NBA and South Park has become a testimony to Beijing’s “review” of domestic public opinion in the United States, and it has also aroused special vigilance from the US ruling and opposition parties. In August, US Twitter closed 200,000 accounts that attacked the people in Hong Kong, and said that these attacks were organized actions that were ""controlled by the government.""
Last year, US President Trump (Trump) also accused the Chinese Communists of interfering in the US midterm elections. At that time, the CCP’s party media attacked Trump in the largest local newspaper in Iowa, and provided evidence for Beijing’s intervention in the US election.
In addition to manipulating public opinion, the CCP has infiltrated the United States for many years and has had a far-reaching impact on US elections. Taiwanese media once said that manipulating US politicians and Chinese teams for ""anti-American"" activities has long been the ""daily work"" of the Chinese diplomats in the United States. The CCP uses the economic interests to buy the US political and business circles, cultivate the pro-communist forces, and exert greater lethality on the US.
In the US-China trade war, the former White House strategic adviser Bannon repeatedly accused the US Wall Street of sending funds for Beijing. Former Vice President Biden, who has become a potential opponent of Trump, has recently been exposed to the interests of his son and Chinese companies.
