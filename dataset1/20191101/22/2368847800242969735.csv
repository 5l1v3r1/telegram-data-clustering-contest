01 Nov 2019, 22:39

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】中國大陸因非洲豬瘟和貿易戰的影響，豬肉價格不斷飆升。近日大陸網絡社群中熱傳一張菜單的照片顯示，某餐廳菜譜中的豬肉精品回鍋肉（10片）標價高達400元（人民幣，下同），讓一眾網友驚掉了下巴。店家回應稱，成本高、份量足，只能定這個價。
「一份回鍋肉，10片賣價400元？」 近日，網友在網絡社交平台上曬出的一張《連山回鍋肉創始人代木兒菜譜》被眾網友瘋傳，並引發大批網友的圍觀與熱議。
圖片上的菜譜中可以看到，一份精品晾竿回鍋肉（10片）的菜品，標價高達400元。熱菜第二排的回鍋肉則按照大、中、小份，分別標價為240元、180元和120元。

網絡社群中眾網友熱議紛紛：「什麼肉這麼貴？」 「400元一份，只有不吃了。」「知道在鬧豬瘟，但這個價格也未免太貴了吧？！」 「要是我能點一份，我肯定會吃出牛排的感覺。」
相關消息引起了陸媒的關注。陸媒《封面》聯繫了這家代木兒店鋪，欲求證這張菜譜的真偽。
11月1日，代木兒店鋪的負責人接受陸媒的採訪表示，菜譜是真實的，定高價的原因是「成本上漲太快，導致漲價。」
據這名負責人介紹，「漲價大概是從4、5天之前開始的，之前一份精品肉，我們定價是在240元。」代梅說，他們使用的豬肉，和普通豬肉並不一樣。為了保證菜品質量，豬肉都是由定點提供，現在，每斤豬肉漲價到了58元。
負責人稱，這種精品晾竿回鍋肉，雖然只有10片肉，但是每片生肉重量在4兩多。製作一份10片的菜餚，僅用肉就需要近5斤。由於成本上漲，她們也沒辦法，只能將價格定在400元每份。

當前往店鋪採訪的記者拿到該店提供的菜譜時，發現精品晾竿回鍋肉這個菜品的定價已經被貼上一張紙條遮蔽起來。對此，店家的解釋是：這種精品回鍋肉的原材料很講究，因原材料吃緊已無法製作。
負責人稱： 「我們也一直在關注市場價格，漲價是基於成本考慮，豬肉價格下降了，我們的定價肯定也會下降。」
