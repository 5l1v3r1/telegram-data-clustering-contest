The Sequel Is Confirmed and We Will Go Back Into The Spider-Verse In April of 2022
01 Nov 2019, 22:44 by Jordan Crucchiola
You’ve already waited long enough, but at least you know now exactly how much longer you will have to wait to go back Into the Spider-Verse. Producer Chris Miller tweeted a very short little promo video today (seriously, it’s just the Spider-Man symbol) with the news that a sequel to the Oscar-winning animated film will hit theaters on April 8, 2022. Since the multiverse has been broken open, who knows what wonders will await in the next chapter, but we would very much like to see more Spider-Ham and Spider-Gwen and Jake Johnson’s Peter Parker and, honestly, all the Spiders from the first movie could come back alongside Miles Morales and that would be cool.
