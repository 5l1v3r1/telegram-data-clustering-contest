四中全會拉開文革序幕？學者:新疆模式或普及全國

01 Nov 2019, 22:37

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】中共四中全會繼續強調「習核心」，強化「黨領導一切」。北京學者認為，這等於全面奏響了重回文革狀態的號角，中共未來可能用「新疆模式」統治全國。
中共10月31日發布的四中全會公報中，重複「堅持」一詞多達55次，包括「堅持馬克思主義基本原理」、「堅持黨的集中統一領導」、「堅持公有制為主體」及「堅持黨對軍隊的絕對領導」等等。
北京文史學者張先生對自由亞洲電台表示，他細看公報發現，歸根結底是中共在強化「黨領導一切」，鞏固統治權。他說，「黨領導一切」是四中全會的唯一議題，「黨的領導」將進入經濟、民生、教育、軍事等各個領域，基本上「全面奏響了一個重新進入文革狀態的號角」。
張先生據此分析，在未來一段時間內，當局無論對香港還是內地，都會實現以「新疆模式」進行管控。
他表示，公報稱中共的治理模式「在錯綜複雜的國際國內環境下取得巨大成功」，這種「成功的治理模式」應該包括嚴控新疆和西藏的「新疆模式」和「西藏模式」、打壓港人的「香港模式」，以及控制其它國家的「一帶一路模式」。甚至在對美貿易戰中，中共也可能總結出一套「模式」。
此外，四中全會公報還稱，堅持「公有制為主體、多種所有制經濟共同發展」，並再次強調「毫不動搖鞏固和發展公有制經濟」。而對私營企業，僅提出「引導非公有制經濟發展」。張先生分析說，這可能是逐漸收緊民營經濟的信號。
時評人劉銳紹也對BBC表示，這次全會強調所謂「治理能力現代化」，其實是用經濟、政治、監控等手段保證中共執政。他認為，中共在政治上會進一步收緊，強化利用人臉識別和信用管理體系監控民眾。
另外，全會公報中稱，要依照《憲法》和《基本法》對港澳「實行管治」，並要求「建立健全特別行政區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制」。外界認為，這是中共將對香港收緊管控的信號。
時事評論員林和立對《蘋果日報》表示，中共要借所謂「完善一國兩制」對香港實施嚴刑峻法，繼續深化北京和香港之間的矛盾。而建立所謂「維護國家安全法律制度」，反映重推「23條立法」已經再次提上中共議事日程。

The Fourth Plenary Session kicked off the Cultural Revolution? Scholar: Xinjiang model or popularize the country

01 Nov 2019, 22:37

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] The Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party continued to emphasize the ""center of learning"" and strengthen ""the party leads everything."" Beijing scholars believe that this is equivalent to fully clarifying the clarion call back to the Cultural Revolution. The CCP may rule the country with the ""Xinjiang Model"" in the future.
In the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China issued on October 31, the word ""persistence"" was repeated as many as 55 times, including ""maintaining the basic principles of Marxism"", ""adhering to the party's centralized and unified leadership"", ""maintaining public ownership as the main body"" and "" Adhere to the party’s absolute leadership over the military and so on.
Mr. Zhang, a scholar of Beijing literature and history, told Radio Free Asia that he looked closely at the communique and found that the CCP is strengthening the ""party leadership"" and consolidating the rule. He said that ""the party leads everything"" is the only topic of the Fourth Plenary Session. ""Party leadership"" will enter the economic, people's livelihood, education, military and other fields, basically ""completely playing a clarion call for re-entering the Cultural Revolution.""
According to this analysis, Mr. Zhang will implement the ""Xinjiang Model"" in both Hong Kong and the Mainland for some time to come.
He said that the communique said that the CCP's governance model ""has achieved great success in the complicated international and domestic environment."" This ""successful governance model"" should include strict control of Xinjiang and Tibet's ""Xinjiang model"" and ""Tibet model"" and suppress the port. The ""Hong Kong model"" of people and the ""One Belt, One Road Model"" that controls other countries. Even in the trade war with the United States, the CCP may conclude a set of ""models.""
In addition, the Fourth Plenary Session also stated that it insists on ""public ownership as the mainstay and multi-ownership economy develop together"" and re-emphasizes ""unswervingly consolidating and developing the public-owned economy."" For private enterprises, only ""guide the development of non-public economy"". Mr. Zhang analyzed that this may be a signal to gradually tighten the private economy.
The commentator Liu Rushao also told the BBC that this plenary session emphasized the so-called ""modernization of governance capacity"", which is to use the means of economy, politics, and monitoring to ensure the CCP's governance. He believes that the CCP will further tighten its politics and strengthen the use of face recognition and credit management systems to monitor the public.
In addition, the plenary session stated that it is necessary to ""administer governance"" to Hong Kong and Macao in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law, and to ""establish a sound legal system and enforcement mechanism for special administrative regions to safeguard national security."" The outside world believes that this is a signal that the CCP will tighten control over Hong Kong.
Current affairs commentator Lin Heli told the Apple Daily that the CCP should use the so-called ""one country, two systems"" to impose strict penalties on Hong Kong and continue to deepen the contradiction between Beijing and Hong Kong. The establishment of the so-called ""maintenance of the national security legal system"" reflects the re-introduction of the ""23 legislation"" that has once again been put on the agenda of the CCP.
