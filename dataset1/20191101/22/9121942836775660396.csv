The women’s squad put seven runners in the top 25 and scored 55 points for its best team point total since last winning the Pac-12 meet in 2009. But second-ranked Stanford posted the best team score since the Huskies’ perfect score in 2008, scoring 27 points to win.

Mariners add pitcher
The Mariners’ first official acquisition of the offseason came Friday when the team claimed right-handed pitcher Phillips Valdez off waivers from the Rangers.
Valdez, who turns 28 on Nov. 16, made 11 relief appearances with Texas last season, posting a 0-0 record with a 3.94 earned-run average. In 16 innings he struck out 18 and walked nine. He made his MLB debut on June 8 against the A’s, pitching two scoreless innings while allowing one hit and issuing two walks.
He spent a large portion of the season with Class AAA Nashville, making 14 starts and 12 relief appearances. He’s had more success as a reliever, posting a 3.75 ERA, while tallying a 5.43 ERA as a starter.
Valdez has pitched for 10 seasons in the minors, including stints with the farm systems for Cleveland (2009-10), Washington (2012-18) and Texas (2019).
With the addition of Valdez, the Mariners’ 40-man roster is now at 35 players.
Men’s basketball
Gonzaga’s backcourt depth absorbed a blow when the school announced that freshman guard Brock Ravet is taking an indefinite leave of absence from the program for personal reasons.
Ravet, who led Kittitas High to three straight Class 2B state titles, was expected to see time as a backup guard. He was the state of Washington’s all-time leading scorer with over 3,000 points in his prep career.
Gonzaga beat NAIA Lewis-Clark State 116-61 in an exhibition game Friday night.
