美網安公司報告:中共竊海外手機信息 政要亦中刀

01 Nov 2019, 22:34

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】美國一家知名網絡安全公司週四發布報告，披露了與中共政府有牽連的中國駭客組織，利用一種新的惡意軟件竊取海外手機用戶發送的短訊和通話記錄的內情。據指，不但異議人士、記者容易成為這些駭客監視的目標，甚至一些國家軍政要員的手機通訊也被駭客竊取，而受害者往往不知情。
美國網絡安全公司火眼（FireEye）10月31日在其官方博客上公布的調查報告披露，與中共政府有關聯的中國駭客組織「高級持續性威脅41（簡稱APT41）」，正通過在海外通訊供應商服務器中植入「短訊監聽器」（MESSAGETAP）惡意軟件，利用事先輸入的手機號碼和國際移動用戶識別碼（IMSI），來攔截竊取成千上萬海外手機用戶發送的短訊，包括一些國家的部份政府軍政要員的手機通訊也被APT41所竊取。
火眼公司的報告指出， APT41駭客組織2012年就開始執行受中共政府支持的網絡間諜使命，並入侵金融機構，在過去10年間頻繁從事監視和網絡犯罪行為。而這群中國駭客的部份鎖定對象是「高價值」目標，全部對象都是依據他們的電話號碼和每支手機獨有的「國際移動用戶辨識碼」（IMSI）來挑選。
這份報告未透露受到影響的個人和通訊供應商的姓名和地點，僅表示這些通訊供應商所在的國家通常都是中國的戰略競爭對手，但已知的受害人不包括美國政府官員。
報告引述公司先進活動監督主任斯通（Steve Stone）說，「與間諜有關的竊取和入侵行為已經存在很長時間了，但由於使用這個新的工具（MESSAGETAP惡意軟件），使得此類行為規模擴大，這是最新的情況。」
據斯通主任介紹，MESSAGETAP惡意軟件是通過關鍵詞來撲捉手機短訊通訊的。有成千上萬的手機號碼成為他們監控的目標，其中包括中共政府可能感興趣的一些高級外國人員。他說：「任何短訊（SMS）如果具有事先列出清單中所含的關鍵詞，比如政治領袖姓名，軍事機構和情報機構的名稱，以及與中國政府作對的政治運動的名稱等，都被竊取。」
火眼公司還特別指出，自從香港今年夏天爆發抗議活動後，APT41組織就開始使用MESSAGETAP惡意軟件，對多家海外通訊公司實施網絡入侵，竊取了目標用戶的通話記錄，包括撥打的電話號碼、通話時間和次數等，而且受害者並不知情，因為用戶的手機本身並沒有被（病毒）感染。
報告最後指出，採用終端對終端加密通訊程序和適當的防範措施，可以在一定程度上減輕被駭客竊取訊息的威脅。此外，用戶教育必須講授手機短訊發送敏感信息的危險。
斯通說：「如果你是被鎖定的目標，並不會知道你的短訊被攔截，因為你的手機並未被植入惡意軟件。」火眼還說，這群駭客也竊取特定人士的詳細通話紀錄，以取得和這些人有互動的電話號碼、通話長度和通話時間。
火眼並未指明被駭設備的製造商，也未詳細說明駭客如何入侵電信商的網路。
火眼在報告中披露，他們觀察到APT41今年鎖定4家電信商，以及部份國家的主要旅遊服務單位和醫療機構。但火眼未指明是哪些國家。

01 Nov 2019, 22:34

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] A well-known US Internet security company released a report on Thursday, revealing a Chinese hacker organization linked to the Chinese government, using a new type of malware to steal short messages from overseas mobile phone users. And the inside of the call record. It is said that not only dissidents and journalists are easily targeted by these hackers, but even some mobile communications of military and political officials in some countries have been stolen by hackers, and victims are often unaware of them.
According to a survey released by the US Internet security company FireEye on its official blog on October 31, the Chinese hacker organization ""Advanced Persistent Threat 41 (referred to as APT41)"", which is related to the Chinese government, is communicating through overseas. The MESSAGETAP malware is embedded in the vendor server, using pre-entered mobile phone numbers and International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) to intercept and steal messages sent by thousands of overseas mobile phone users, including The mobile communication of some government military and political figures in some countries was also stolen by APT41.
According to the report of the Fire Eye Company, the APT41 hacker organization began to implement the cyber espionage mission supported by the Chinese government in 2012 and invaded financial institutions, and has frequently engaged in surveillance and cybercrime in the past 10 years. The target of this group of Chinese hackers is the ""high value"" target, all of which are selected based on their phone number and the unique International Mobile Subscriber Identification Number (IMSI) for each mobile phone.
