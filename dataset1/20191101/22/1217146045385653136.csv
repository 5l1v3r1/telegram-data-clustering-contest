The Week in Ransomware - November 1st 2019 - A Mix of Good and Bad
01 Nov 2019, 22:16 by Lawrence Abrams



This week has been a mix of good and bad news. The bad news is that ransomware disrupted legal work and court cases through the TrialWorks infection, schools having to shut down, and new campaigns targeting Italy.
The good news, though, is that we have had two decryptors released that allow Paradise and Ouroboros Ransomware victims to recover their files for free.
Otherwise, its been a mix of new ransomware and new variants of existing ransomware being released.
Contributors and those who provided new ransomware information and stories this week include: @Seifreed, @BleepinComputer, @PolarToffee, @jorntvdw, @LawrenceAbrams, @malwareforme, @fwosar, @struppigel, @demonslay335, @malwrhunterteam, @DanielGallagher, @serghei, @Ionut_Ilascu, @FourOctets, @IntelAdvanced, @emsisoft, @GrujaRS, @JAMESWT_MHT, @JakubKroustek, @thepacketrat, @Renee_Dudley, @fbgwls245, and @Bitdefender
