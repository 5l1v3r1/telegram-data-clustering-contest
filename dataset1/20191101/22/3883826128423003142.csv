Barnsley 2-2 Bristol City: Cauley Woodrow gives Tykes last-gasp draw
01 Nov 2019, 22:25 by Brendon Mitchell


Cauley Woodrow spent the 2017-18 season on loan with Bristol City prior to joining Barnsley


Cauley Woodrow scored with the final kick of the game as struggling Barnsley came from 2-0 down to draw with promotion hopefuls Bristol City.

Woodrow scrambled in from close range deep into stoppage time to lift the Tykes off the bottom of the Championship table and prevent City from moving up to second.
Wales defender Ashley Williams put the Robins in front shortly before half-time, heading Niclas Eliasson's free-kick in at the far post completely unmarked.
Andreas Weimann then doubled Bristol City's lead with 20 minutes remaining when he guided another wicked Eliasson set-piece delivery into the bottom corner.
But Aapo Halme's excellent header gave the hosts late hope and the Tykes, still winless since the opening weekend of the season, snatched a deserved late draw through Woodrow's toe-poked finish.



It was Barnsley's third stalemate in four games under caretaker boss Adam Murray, whose side again showed signs of improvement and were good value for a point on the overall balance of play.
They were unfortunate to find themselves behind in the first half, with Robins goalkeeper Daniel Bentley making two superb saves - first tipping Mallik Wilks' curler around the post and then brilliantly diverting Conor Chaplin's snap shot onto the woodwork.
Barnsley mustered more than 20 attempts on goal across the entire game and, but for two lapses of concentration at set-plays, may well have won the match.
As it is, the Oakwell outfit are now 15 games without a victory in all competitions and on their longest winless run since 1959.
Bristol City's misery was compounded by the loss of captain Josh Brownhill in the first half, who added to their long list of injury woes by limping off with what was later revealed to be a back spasm.
They are already without first-team players such as Jay Dasilva, Adam Nagy and Benik Afobe, although Friday's game did mark the return of club-record signing Tomas Kalas at centre-half.

Barnsley caretaker manager Adam Murray told BBC Radio Sheffield:

""There's a little bit of anger and frustration but to nick a point is always nice.
""At points during the game we could have made more of the chances we had.
""But overall there's a sense of pride at the passion we've shown and it put a lump in my throat at the end of the game.""

Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol:

""I'm disappointed with the lads today for the first time this season - we had 45 seconds to see out for the win.
""We should have had enough at 2-0 up to see the game out.
""The crowd had completely gone at 2-0 but we allowed them a way back into the game.""
