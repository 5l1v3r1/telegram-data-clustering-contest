Johhny Walker can’t help scoring quick KOs: ‘I want to fight, but I hit them and they fall’
01 Nov 2019, 22:00 by Lucas Rezende



Not many fighters would be unsatisfied with scoring three consecutive knockouts before the two-minute mark in their first three UFC showings, but light heavyweight prospect Johnny Walker wants to show that there is more to him than just flashy strikes and raw power.

Paired up against Corey Anderson at UFC 244, the 27-year-old is hoping for a chance to prove that he is more than what he has been able to show so far. Mostly that just means hoping that Anderson won’t fall to the ground quite so fast.

“I don’t plan to get those quick knockouts.” Walker told Combate. “I want to fight, but I hit them and they fall. It’s not my fault.”
In fact, Walker feels so confident in his skills that he says he’s ready to take on the champion himself, Jon Jones. And while he hopes that will come with a win over Anderson, he doesn’t mind climbing the rankings more slowly, if need be.
“I think I’m the new sensation now. I don’t consider myself a promise anymore. Promises don’t come true. I’m true, brother, I’ll be the champion.”
“If I were to (fight Jon Jones after Corey Anderson), I’d be ready.” Walker continued. “If not, I’ll keep climbing step by step, little by little, until I get there. I’ll be trouble for him (Jones)”.
With three fast knockout wins in the Octagon, Johnny Walker (17-3) made quick work of Khalil Rountree, Justin Ledet and most recently, in March, Misha Cirkunov. The Brazilian’s last loss dates back to June 2016, when he was knocked out by Henrique Lopes at Jungle Fight 88.
UFC 244 is scheduled to be headlined by a welterweight bout between Nate Diaz and Jorge Masvidal. Walker vs. Anderson is set for the feature prelim on ESPN 2, just before the start of the PPV portion of the event.
