01 Nov 2019, 22:37 by 陳立妍
32歲的池昌旭歷經2年空白期，退伍後以奇幻喜劇《請融化我》回歸螢光幕。劇情描述他飾演的電視節目製作人，因為參與24小時冷凍人企劃意外沉睡20年，甦醒後除了面對「人生大洗牌」及「新世代生活」，與元真兒、尹世雅更陷入微妙「三角關係」，甚至和大9歲的尹世雅有激烈吻戲，「姐弟戀」成為一大亮點。

推薦給：

等待池昌旭2年的戲迷
喜歡輕鬆愛情喜劇但又帶一點懸疑元素的你


《請融化我》由《秘密花園》《紳士的品格》導演申宇哲，攜手《大力女子都奉順》《有品位的她》編劇白美瓊作家共同打造，故事敘述一對參加24小時冷凍人企劃的男女，卻因為一場神祕陰謀，導致兩人在20年後才甦醒。因為實驗的副作用，他們必須將體溫維持於31.5度，一旦體溫超過33度就會有性命危險，炙熱的愛情對他們而言變成「禁止項目」，宣傳海報上也寫著「你與我最熾熱的瞬間是33度」，預告兩人將有一場虐戀。

池昌旭以《Ｈealer》《The K2》等劇奠定「動作男神」地位，這次他在《請融化我》扮電視台王牌製作人，親自參與一項祕密的冷凍人計畫，沒想到主導及負責該實驗的黃博士竟在他們解凍前發生車禍，導致他與飾演節目班底兼女大生的元真兒在冷凍艙內睡了20年，劇情圍繞於博士周遭的陰謀，以及他們在2019年展開新生活所發生的趣事，此時兩人的舊愛也接連出現攪局，讓他們的生活掀起重重波瀾。

此外，劇中找來不少偶像客串助陣，首集有韓國「第一代偶像H.O.T」成員Tony An客串頒獎嘉賓，FTISLAND主唱李洪基更在前幾集扮演池昌旭的電視台後輩，20年後的同角色改由林元熙接演，從花美男變成大叔，不用多解釋光用畫面就說明了「歲月是一把殺豬刀」，記者會上林元熙也搞笑對李洪基喊話：「我在這裡正式的向李洪基道歉。」
除了Tony An、李洪基，前Secret成員宋枝恩及前B1A4團員Baro也分別客串元真兒的大學好友及男友。

不過，故事以「冷凍人實驗」為開端，顯然不受婆媽觀眾青睞，加上前幾集劇情節奏緩慢，不少網友都表示「因為是池昌旭才有追劇動力」，但撇開冷凍人及懸疑元素，《請融化我》其實就是一齣喜劇，而劇中關於元真兒一家人的親情描寫，也頗賺人熱淚。
《請融化我》另一「嬌點」是在《Sky Castle天空之城》飾演雙胞胎媽媽的美魔女尹世雅，她在劇中飾演新聞台主播，是池昌旭的初戀情人，與池昌旭相隔20年重逢，雖然兩人在外表、人生歷練已有落差，但仍抱有舊情。為挽回舊愛，尹世雅主動出擊，甚至幻想和池昌旭重修舊好在飯店「激吻」，而池昌旭與元真兒也有濕身熱吻的吻戲，可說是艷福不淺。
