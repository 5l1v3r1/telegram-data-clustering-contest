【理財最前線】別讓勞工權益睡著　承攬僱傭保障差很大
01 Nov 2019, 22:59 by 劉以親, 陳俊銘, 鄒保祥
近來美食平台外送員頻發生交通意外，接連幾件死亡車禍，引發社會關注，連帶爆出平台業者與外送員是「承攬關係」而非「僱傭關係」，因此沒有替員工投保勞健保。對此，勞動部認為，與外送員的關係並非業者說了算，為了保障外送員權益，新制預計年底上路，杜絕「假承攬、真僱傭」。民眾要搞懂箇中細節，別讓自己的權益睡著了。
「我白天在外商公司當業務，下班兼職當外送員，正考慮明年全職投入外送員的工作。」25歲的邱先生月薪5萬元，靠著外送兼職每月幫自己加薪約1萬7千元，因為聽到好友全職外送曾月入破10萬元，讓他動心想辭掉業務工作專心跑單。
國慶連假外送員車禍事件頻傳，撞出美食外送平台未替外送員投保勞健保的真相。邱先生自認騎車小心，仍不免擔心起自身權益，「如果轉全職，得要問問公司能提供哪些保障？」

外送員之死　撞出僱傭爭議
針對外送員之死爆出「承攬」與「僱傭」爭議，外送龍頭foodpanda表示，透過平台，零碎的勞力資源得以有效利用，也讓付出勞動者可以彈性賺取報酬，「與外送夥伴為承攬關係，但會持續與主管機關探討最符合平台經濟的商業模式。」
對此「承攬關係」說法，勞動部並不買單，職安署署長鄒子廉表示，從平台業者與外送員訂定的合約來看，包括指定工作時段、工作需穿制服、使用制式品牌圖樣保溫箱、機車黏貼品牌貼紙，以及若無法在工作時段提供服務須24小時內回報等，業者對外送員具有一定程度的指揮監督，也存在組織從屬性，因此認定具僱傭關係，須依《勞基法》在期限內給予罹難者職災補償。
二家龍頭業者foodpanda和Uber Eats雖在第一時間提供罹難家屬優於《勞基法》的撫恤金，但勞動部跟平台業者針對勞務契約仍無共識。10月30日職安署公布目前9家平台業者的專案檢查，經抽查個案認定業者與其外送員是僱傭關係者有5家，包括foodpanda、Uber Eats、lalamove、Cutaway、Quick Pick。


勞保是勞工最基本的社會保險，舉凡生育、傷病、失能、老年、死亡及職災都有給付。

面對勞動部強硬主張，就有外送平台發出「外送夥伴意見調查表」，詢問旗下外送員在「承攬」或「僱傭」的合作條件下，哪一種較適合目前的接單狀態？前者沒有工時上下限，業者不負擔勞健保，而後者有工時規定，但業者會幫外送員投保勞健保，並且提撥6％新制勞工退休金。
「我當然關心自身權益啊！如果公司願意幫我加入勞健保、提撥退休金，這樣福利較好！」但邱先生也擔心，一旦公司增加勞健保及6％勞退，以薪資4萬5800元投保級距為例，每月要為勞工多付8000多元成本，那這行月入10萬元的傳說是不是就會消失，也因此有外送員表示支持承攬關係。
　
若因公罹難　屬承攬沒得賠
到底「承攬」與「僱傭」差異何在？法扶基金會專職律師林靜文分析，僱傭關係受《勞基法》保障，雇主須幫勞工投保勞健保；而「承攬」關係則不適用《勞基法》。當發生職災事故時，《勞基法》規定遭遇職業傷害死亡者，雇主除了要給五個月平均工資的喪葬費之外，還須一次給與遺屬40個月平均工資的死亡補償，但若屬承攬，則一毛錢都拿不到，保障落差相當大。
其實承攬、僱傭的勞務契約糾紛，並非第一次躍上新聞版面，最有名的例子就是爭議多年的南山人壽，部分保險業務員主張自己的勞務契約屬僱傭，但南山人壽卻認定業務員招攬保險以件數、業績計算，雙方關係非僱傭而是承攬，為此爭議司法院大法官還發布第740號解釋，但各界解讀仍不一。

在南山人壽服務十多年的陳先生坦言，自己與資方就是承攬契約，「我的勞健保不在公司，要自掏腰包加在保險業務職業工會底下，只能自己多做點業績，靠獎金補貼勞健保保費。」陳先生語氣無奈。
在公司打拚28年的何先生則表示，至今還是不知道自己跟南山人壽之間是僱傭或承攬，因為公司有幫他投保勞健保，卻沒有幫他提撥6％新制勞工退休金，而且也有同事是這樣。
依規定，雇主幫員工投保勞健保的同時，也要提撥新制勞工退休金，但南山人壽卻遲遲未做，為此勞保局每月開罰50萬元。南山人壽企業工會常務理事施少華氣憤地說：「公司說不是僱傭，而是承攬，不願意給退休金，那我們就爭取真正的承攬權益，包括公司不能考核業績、可以續領保單續期佣金等，但公司又不願意接受。」

司法院大法官釋字第740號解釋文
保險業務員與其所屬保險公司所簽訂之保險招攬勞務契約，是否為《勞動基準法》第2條第6款所稱勞動契約，應視保險業務員能否自由決定勞務給付方式（包括工作時間），並自行負擔業務風險（如按所招攬保險收受的保險費為基礎計算其報酬）以為斷，不得直接以保險業務員管理規則為認定依據。

　
找工會投保　月繳多千餘元
事實上，在現行的勞務契約下，並非每個雇主都有義務幫勞工加保勞健保、提撥退休金，須視契約形式而定，而常見的勞務契約有僱傭、承攬、委任、合夥等四種形式，相關勞工權益各有異同。
勞保局納保組代理組長林秀襄指出，「勞工保險和就業保險是在職保險，以僱傭關係為前提，必須是受僱勞工才可由雇主加保。但如果勞資雙方簽的是承攬契約，那資方就不算是雇主，勞方則屬於自營作業者，可以自行透過職業工會加保勞健保。」


勞保局納保組代理組長林秀襄（右）表示，屬於承攬的自營作業者，可透過職業工會加勞保。

實務上，承攬是當事人約定，一方為他方完成一定的工作，他方在完成工作後給付報酬的合約，例如油漆工承包業務、室內設計師裝修房屋、文字工作者接案撰稿等皆是，這些族群因為沒有固定雇主，所以沒有老闆幫忙投保勞健保，但因為實際從事勞務工作，只要透過職業工會加保，同樣可享有勞健保權益，但保費負擔會高些。
以月薪4萬5800元、勞保費率10％為例，受僱勞工因有雇主幫忙負擔7成、政府補助一成，因此月繳2成，只要916元，但工會勞工需自付6成，即2748元，剩餘4成才由政府補助。

無失業給付　也沒育嬰福利
特別要注意的是，勞保保障包含普通事故、職災事故，另有就業保險，而工會勞工因為沒有固定雇主，無法參加就業保險，因此如果遭遇非自願性失業時，無法申請失業給付，也不能申請育嬰留職停薪津貼，這也是相對於僱傭，承攬關係較無保障的一環。
不僅承攬契約引發議論，委任契約也曾經發生糾紛。2012年，時任鴻海新綠數事業群總經理的謝冠宏，因為祕書填錯假單日期，在飛機上接到董事長郭台銘電話要求下機回公司開會，但當時機艙門已經關閉，郭董一句：「如果沒有回來，就再也不用回來了！」謝冠宏隨即被以曠職解僱。

事後謝冠宏主張，鴻海是非法解僱，求償資遣費、工作獎金及股票，但鴻海否認，並強調謝冠宏是高階經理人，上下班不必打卡，手下有逾萬名的台陸籍員工，雙方是委任關係，不適用《勞基法》。不過，法官認為謝冠宏須服從公司權威，因而認定雙方是僱傭關係，今年4月最高法院判鴻海敗訴，需賠付150萬元資遣費與235張鴻海股票，換算市值超過2000萬元。
相較於僱傭，委任少了哪些權益呢？在勞務形式上，與資方之間屬於委任關係者，通常是高階經理人或分公司負責人，因為擁有較大的自主權，並不屬於《勞基法》所指的勞工，因而不適用加班費、休假、資遣費等權益，公司也沒有義務提撥6％新制退休金。

權益自己顧　定期檢視專戶
在新制勞工退休金制度上路前，曾有香港著名服飾集團台灣分公司負責人，在公司服務了25年退休，控告公司應該支付2800多萬元的舊制退休金，但公司主張雙方是委任關係，最後勞工敗訴。不過，勞保局勞工退休金組專委王昭卿表示，實質上是不是委任關係，還是要看雙方合約跟勞動條件而定。
有鑑於一般民眾不易分辨勞務契約，恐掉入「假委任、真僱傭」或「假承攬、真僱傭」的陷阱，林靜文提醒，面試報到時，除了約定薪資，也要了解工作規則與員工福利，尤其簽署的契約內容若有涉及保密條款、競業禁止規定，就會傾向認定是僱傭關係。
「委任關係通常也有保密條款，那必須再依是否有從屬性做判斷，例如上下班有沒有打卡、對公司需高度服從等。」林靜文表示，除了雇主不幫勞工投保勞健保規避費用負擔的情形，實務上也常見雇主「高薪低報」，因此，勞工最好定期檢視薪資條和新制勞工退休金專戶。


　

　
勞保權益Q&A

Q1：面試時，老闆說沒有勞保福利，要自己去加入職業工會，這樣合法嗎？

A：依《勞保條例》規定，年滿15歲以上、65歲以下的勞工，只要是受僱在有5人以上（含5人）員工的公司行號，雇主都要強制幫勞工投保勞工保險和就業保險，至於員工4人以下的公司，就業保險同樣是強制參加，但勞保部分未強制，雇主可自願幫員工投保。

Q2：參加勞保，不幸發生職災有什麼權益？

A：有職災醫療給付（含門診及住院）、傷病給付、失能給付、死亡給付（含失蹤津貼）、職災勞工保護補助。

Q3：如何知道雇主有確實投保勞保？

A：查詢方式有4種：1.使用自然人憑證登入勞保局e化服務系統（https://edesk.bli.gov.tw/aa/）查詢，並可查詢雇主是否有確實提撥6%新制勞工退休金；2.申請勞動保障卡，至發卡銀行的ATM查詢；3.持郵政金融卡到郵局申請並簽署同意書，則可透過郵局ATM查詢；4.持身分證件至勞保局辦事處臨櫃查詢。


使用自然人憑證可查詢到雇主是否依法給予勞保及新制退休金權益。


Q4：若發現雇主沒有投保勞保或高薪低報怎麼辦？

A：可以書面方式郵寄具體事項及相關資訊到勞保局總局（100台北市中正區羅斯福路一段4號），或至辦事處臨櫃提報檢舉，也可以電話陳情。

Q5：下班的兼職是僱傭關係嗎？如果兼職公司也幫忙投保勞保，會不會被正職公司發現？

A：兼職工作很多情形屬僱傭關係，例如學生兼職工讀，雇主除了要幫工讀生投保勞健保之外，還要按月提撥工資6％的新制退休金。派遣也是僱傭關係，由派遣公司加保勞健保。
投保單位無法查詢到其他投保單位的資料，所以不用擔心被老闆發現，除非原先的勞保是加保在職業工會底下，那麼勞保局會去函職業工會，確認加保身分是否異常重覆。
因正職與兼職而重覆投保勞保，也是有好處的，一來不管在哪個工作崗位都享有保障，二來萬一發生普通事故（非職災導致），如生病或受傷以致不能工作或失能，相關給付可以2個投保薪資併計，例如正職投保薪資3萬300元，兼職投保薪資1萬2,540元，併計就是4萬2,840元（最高不得超過4萬5,800元）。

[The front line of financial management] Don't let the labor rights fall asleep.
01 Nov 2019, 22:59 by Liu Yiqin, Chen Junming, Zou Baoxiang
Recently, there have been frequent traffic accidents in the delivery of food courts. Several consecutive car accidents have caused concern in the community. As a result, the platform operators and the delivery staff have been ""contracted"" rather than ""employed"". Therefore, they have not insured their employees. In this regard, the Ministry of Labor believes that the relationship with the delivery staff is not the industry's final say, in order to protect the rights of the delivery staff, the new system is expected to go on the road at the end of the year, to prevent ""fake contract, real employment."" People should understand the details of the shackles and don't let their rights fall asleep.
""I am a business in a foreign company during the day, and I am a part-time job as a delivery person. I am considering full-time job of the delivery staff next year."" Mr. Qiu, 25, has a monthly salary of 50,000 yuan, and he is helping to raise his salary by paying part-time job each month. 17,000 yuan, because I heard that my friend had a full-time delivery and had a monthly income of 100,000 yuan, which made him want to quit his business and concentrate on running the order.
On the National Day, even the accidental delivery of car accidents was frequently reported, and the truth of the labor insurance was not taken out by the delivery platform. Mr. Qiu is self-confident in cycling and he is still worried about his rights and interests. ""If you turn to full-time, you have to ask what kind of protection the company can provide?""


The delivery staff who ran across the street and the food platform operators did not help them to pay for the truth of labor insurance. (turning over the waste commune)


The death of the deliveryman, the employment dispute
In response to the death of the delivery staff, the ""contract"" and ""employment"" disputes were thrown out. The food leader, Foodpanda, said that through the platform, the fragmented labor resources can be effectively utilized, and the workers can be rewarded with flexibility. In order to undertake the relationship, but will continue to discuss with the competent authorities the business model that best fits the platform economy.""
According to the ""contract relationship"", the Ministry of Labor does not pay the bill. The Director of the Department of Internal Security, Zou Zilian, said that from the contract set by the platform operators and the delivery staff, including the designated working hours, the work required to wear uniforms, and the use of the standard brand pattern incubator The locomotive sticks to the brand sticker, and if it is unable to provide the service within 24 hours during the working hours, the operator has a certain degree of command and supervision for the delivery of the employee, and there is also an organizational subordination. Therefore, it is determined that the employment relationship must be based on the ""Laoji Law"". ""The compensation for the victims of the victims will be given within the time limit.
Although the two leading companies, foodpanda and Uber Eats, provided the first-time pension for their families to be better than the ""Laoji Law"", the Ministry of Labor and the platform industry still have no consensus on the labor contract. On October 30, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration announced the current project inspection of nine platform operators. According to the sample investigation, there were five employers and their delivery staff, including foodpanda, Uber Eats, lalamove, Cutaway, and Quick Pick.


Labor insurance is the most basic social insurance for workers. All births, injuries, disability, old age, death and occupational disasters are paid.

In the face of the tough stance of the Ministry of Labor, there is a delivery platform for the “Delivery Partner Opinion Survey Form” to ask the subcontractors to cooperate under the conditions of “contracting” or “hiring”. Which one is more suitable for the current order status? The former does not have upper and lower working hours, the industry does not bear labor and health insurance, while the latter has working hours regulations, but the industry will help the delivery staff to pay for labor and health insurance, and 6% new labor pension.
""I certainly care about my own rights! If the company is willing to help me join the labor insurance and provide a pension, the benefits are better!"" But Mr. Qiu is also worried that once the company increases labor and health insurance and 6% labor retreat, the salary is 4,500,800. For example, the yuan-guaranteed level of wages is required to pay more than 8,000 yuan per month for labor. If the monthly income of 100,000 yuan is lost, it will be said that the delivery staff will support the contractual relationship.

If it is due to the public, it is not a contract.
What is the difference between ""contract"" and ""employment""? According to Lin Jingwen, a full-time lawyer of the Law Foundation, the employment relationship is protected by the Law of Labor, employers are required to help laborers to pay for labor and health insurance, and the ""contracting"" relationship does not apply to the ""Laoji Law."" In the event of an occupational accident, the ""Laoji Law"" stipulates that those who have suffered occupational injury will be compensated for the 40-month average salary of the surviving family in addition to the funeral expenses of the five-month average salary. If it is contracted, then a dime can not be obtained, and the guarantee gap is quite large.
In fact, the labor contract disputes contracted and hired are not the first time to jump on the news page. The most famous example is Nanshan Life Insurance, which has been controversial for many years. Some insurance salesmen claim that their labor contracts are employment, but Nanshan Life Insurance has identified salesmen as insurance. In terms of the number of pieces and performance, the relationship between the two parties is not hired but contracted. For this reason, the court judge of the Dispute Division also issued the interpretation of No. 740, but the interpretation of the various circles is still different.


Some insurance salesmen of Nanshan Life Insurance have taken to the streets for their labor contracts for many years. (Central News Agency)

Mr. Chen, who has served in Nanshan Life for more than ten years, admits that he and the employer are contracting contracts. ""My labor insurance is not in the company. I have to pay for myself in the insurance industry. I can only do more performance myself. Health insurance premiums."" Mr. Chen was helpless.
Mr. He, who has worked hard for 28 years in the company, said that he still does not know whether he is employed or contracted with Nanshan Life Insurance because the company has helped him to pay for labor insurance, but he did not help him to pay 6% of the new labor pension. Colleagues are like this.
According to the regulations, when employers help employees to pay for labor and health insurance, they also need to pay new labor pensions. However, Nanshan Life Insurance has not done so, and the Labor Insurance Bureau issued a monthly fine of 500,000 yuan. Shi Shaohua, executive director of the Nanshan Life Insurance Enterprise Union, said angrily: ""The company said that it is not employment, but contracting, not willing to give a pension, then we will fight for real contractual rights, including the company can not assess performance, can renew the policy renewal commission, etc. But the company is not willing to accept it.""

Interpretation of the Court of Justice, Interpretation No. 740
Whether the insurance sales contract signed by the insurance salesperson and its insurance company is the labor contract referred to in Article 2, paragraph 6, of the Labor Standards Law, should the insurance salesman be free to determine the labor payment method (including working hours). And to bear the business risk (such as calculating the remuneration based on the insurance premiums received by the insurance), it is considered that the insurance management rules are not directly determined.


Looking for a union to insure, pay more than a thousand yuan a month.
In fact, under the current labor contract, not every employer has the obligation to help workers to protect their health insurance and provide pensions, depending on the form of the contract. The common labor contracts include employment, contracting, appointment, partnership, etc. There are four forms and similar labor rights and interests.
Lin Xiuzhen, acting director of the Insurance Bureau of the Insurance Bureau, pointed out that ""labor insurance and employment insurance are on-the-job insurance, and the employment relationship must be based on the employment relationship. The employer must be insured by the employer. But if the employer and the employee sign the contract, the employer will Not an employer, the laborer is a self-employed operator and can self-pay labor insurance through the professional union.""


Lin Xiuzhen (right), the acting leader of the Insurance Bureau of the Insurance Bureau, said that the self-operated operators who belong to the contract can work through the professional trade unions.

In practice, the contract is a contract stipulated by the parties, and one party completes certain work for the other party. The contract that the other party pays after completing the work, such as the painter contracting business, the interior designer decoration house, the writing of the writing worker, etc. Because the ethnic group does not have a fixed employer, there is no boss to help with the labor and health insurance. However, because of the actual labor service, as long as the professional union is added, the same can enjoy the labor and health insurance rights, but the premium burden will be higher.
Taking the monthly salary of 45,800 yuan and the labor insurance rate of 10% as an example, the employer has 70% of the employer's help and 10% of the government subsidy. Therefore, the monthly payment is 20%, as long as 916 yuan, but the labor union workers need to pay 60%. That is 2748 yuan, the remaining 40% is subsidized by the government.


The self-opening interior designer took over the decoration of the house and had a contractual relationship with the owner.


No unemployment benefits, no parenting benefits
It is important to note that labor insurance covers ordinary accidents, occupational accidents, and employment insurance. Trade union workers cannot participate in employment insurance because they do not have a fixed employer. Therefore, if they encounter involuntary unemployment, they cannot apply for unemployment benefits. Applying for a maternity leave pay allowance is also a relatively insecure part of employment and contracting.
Not only did the contract contract lead to arguments, but the appointment contract also had disputes. In 2012, Xie Guanhong, the then general manager of the Hon Hai new green number business group, received the wrong date from the secretary and received a phone call from the chairman Guo Taiming on the plane to request the next flight back to the company. However, the cabin door was closed. Guo Dong said: If you don't come back, you won't have to come back again!"" Xie Guanhong was immediately dismissed from office.


Xie Guanhong, the general manager of the former Honghai Group's new green number business group, and the company's lawsuit, successfully won their own employment rights. (Reflected from Baidu Encyclopedia)

Afterwards, Xie Guanhong claimed that Hon Hai was illegally dismissed, claiming severance expenses, work bonuses and stocks, but Hon Hai denied, and stressed that Xie Guanhong is a high-ranking manager. He does not have to punch in and out of work, and there are more than 10,000 Taiwanese employees. Relationship, does not apply to the ""Laoji Law."" However, the judge believes that Xie Guanhong must obey the authority of the company, and therefore that the two parties are in an employment relationship. In April this year, the Supreme Court sentenced Hon Hai to lose the case, and it was required to pay 1.5 million yuan for the severance payment and 235 Hon Hai shares, and the market value was more than 20 million yuan.
What are the benefits of appointing compared to hiring? In the form of labor services, the appointee relationship with the employer is usually the senior manager or the head of the branch. Because it has greater autonomy, it does not belong to the labor referred to in the ""Laoji Law"" and therefore does not apply to overtime. The company is also not obligated to pay 6% of new pensions for fees, vacations, and severance pay.


A part-time job is not necessarily a contract. A work-student working at a gas station is an employment relationship with an employer.


Self-rights, regular inspection of the account
In front of the new labor pension system, there was the head of the Hong Kong famous clothing group Taiwan branch. After serving for 25 years, the company sued the company for paying more than 28 million yuan of old pension, but the company claimed that the two sides are appointed. Finally, the labor lost. However, Wang Zhaoqing, a special committee member of the Labor Insurance Bureau of the Labor Insurance Bureau, said that whether it is an appointment relationship or not depends on the contract and labor conditions.
In view of the fact that the general public is not easy to distinguish between labor contracts, fear of falling into the trap of ""false appointment, real employment"" or ""false contract, real employment"", Lin Jingwen reminds that in the interview, in addition to the salary, we must also understand the work rules and employee benefits. In particular, if the content of the contract signed involves confidentiality provisions and non-compete regulations, it will tend to be an employment relationship.
""The appointing relationship usually also has confidentiality clauses. It must be judged according to whether it has any attributes, such as whether there is a punch in the shift or not, and the company needs to be highly obeyed."" Lin Jingwen said that in addition to the employer not helping the workers to pay for labor and health care, avoiding the burden of expenses. In practice, employers are also often referred to as “high-paying under-reports”. Therefore, it is best for workers to regularly review payroll and new labor pension accounts.





Labor Insurance Rights Q&A

Q1: At the time of the interview, the boss said that there is no labor insurance, and it is legal to join the professional trade union.

A: According to the Labor Insurance Regulations, workers who are over 15 years of age and under 65 years of age must be forced to help laborers to apply for labor insurance as long as they are employed by a company with more than 5 employees (including 5 employees). And employment insurance. As for companies with less than 4 employees, employment insurance is also mandatory, but the labor insurance is not mandatory, and employers can volunteer to help employees.


Self-employed workers who participate in labor insurance through professional unions cannot participate in employment insurance because they do not have a fixed employer. (Turning the Taipei City Massage Union Professional Union official website)


Q2: What are the rights and benefits of participating in labor insurance and unfortunately having a job?

A: There are occupational disaster medical benefits (including outpatient and hospitalization), injury payment, disability payment, death payment (including missing allowance), and occupational disaster labor protection subsidy.

Q3: How do I know if my employer is actually insured?

A: There are 4 ways to check: 1. Use the natural person's voucher to log in to the Labor Insurance Bureau e-Service System (https://edesk.bli.gov.tw/aa/) and check if the employer has actually paid 6% of the new system. Labor pension; 2. Apply for labor insurance card, ATM inquiry to the issuing bank; 3. Apply for postal financial card to the post office and sign the consent form, you can check the ATM through the post office; 4. Hold the identity card to the office of the Labor Insurance Bureau. Cabinet inquiry.


The natural person certificate can be used to find out whether the employer has legally granted labor insurance and new pension benefits.


Q4: What if I find that my employer is not insured for labor insurance or high salary and low income?

A: You can post specific matters and relevant information in writing to the General Bureau of Labor Insurance Bureau (100, Section 4, Roosevelt Road, Zhongzheng District, Taipei City), or report to the office for reporting. You can also call the case.

Q5: Is part-time work after work an employment relationship? If a part-time company also helps to insure labor insurance, will it be discovered by the company?

A: Part-time work Many situations are employment relationships. For example, students and employees read. In addition to helping workers and students to pay for labor insurance, they also need to pay a new pension of 6% on a monthly basis. Dispatch is also an employment relationship, and the dispatch company will protect the labor insurance.
The insured unit cannot find out the information of other insured units, so don't worry about being discovered by the boss. Unless the original labor insurance is under the professional trade union, the labor insurance bureau will write to the professional trade union to confirm whether the additional insurance status is abnormally repeated.
It is also beneficial to reinsure labor insurance for both regular and part-time jobs. In the first place, there is protection in the workplace, and in the event of an ordinary accident (caused by non-service disasters), such as illness or injury, it is impossible to work or disable The relevant payment can be paid in two insured wages, for example, the salary of the insured insurance is 3,300 yuan, the salary of the part-time insurance is 12,540 yuan, and the total salary is 42,200 yuan (the maximum is not more than 45,800 yuan).
