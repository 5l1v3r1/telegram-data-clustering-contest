管治香港更嚴？四中後中共提「完善」特首任免制

01 Nov 2019, 22:36

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】剛結束的中共四中全會，首次提出對香港澳門「實行管治」。隨後中共官員又進一步解釋稱，要「完善特區行政長官的任免制度」。外界擔憂，中共可能要與港人要求的「雙普選」背道而馳。
10月31日發布的四中全會公報稱，要依照《憲法》和《基本法》對港澳「實行管治」，並要「建立健全特別行政區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制」。
11月1日，在中共中央宣傳部舉行的四中全會新聞發布會上，港澳基本法委員會主任沈春耀對公報內容做了進一步闡述。他強調，要堅持「以愛國者為主體」的「港人治港」和「澳人治澳」，同時加強對港澳公職人員和青少年的「憲法和基本法教育」和「國情教育」，增強港澳同胞的「國家意識和愛國精神」。
沈春耀還提到，「要完善中央對特別行政區行政長官和主要官員的任免制度和機制」以及「全國人大常委會對基本法的解釋制度」，「行使憲法和基本法賦予中央的各項權力」。還要「建立健全特別行政區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制」，支持特區「強化執法力量」。
目前，香港特首名義上是由1,200人組成的選舉委員會投票產生，但大部份選舉委員都受中共操控，選出的特首也必須獲得北京任命，否則還要從新選舉。如今中共在加強「港澳管治」的同時，還要「完善」特首的「任免制度」，外界擔心將距離港人要求的「雙普選」更為遙遠。
BBC引述一位大陸歷史學者的說法稱，四中全會公報中有關「管治港澳」和「國安立法」等說法，應該是首次出現，說明中共可能要繼續背離所謂「一國兩制」，把中共的那套所謂「法治」延伸到港澳。香港中文大學客座教授林和立則認為，北京當局這次更加強調所謂「國家安全」，說明對香港民眾沒有妥協的跡象，港人與北京之間的深層次矛盾將會加劇。
另外，與中共「完善特首任免制度」直接相關的是，日前英媒傳出北京正考慮明年3月撤換現任港首林鄭月娥，並由前香港金融管理局總裁陳德霖或者前香港政務司長唐英年代理「臨時行政長官」。一些港媒認為，該消息絕非空穴來風。
依照香港《基本法》，如果特首在任期內提前離職，將由現任政務司長署任特首，直到選出新特首。如果北京決意另外指定「臨時行政長官」，自然需要首先「完善特首任免制度」。
值得一提的是，現任香港政務司長張建宗在今年7月21日黑社會血洗元朗事件後，曾經公開代警隊向市民道歉，結果遭警方威脅與他「勢不兩立」。

Governing Hong Kong is more stringent? After the Fourth China and the Middle East, the CCP proposed the ""perfect"" special appointment and dismissal system.

01 Nov 2019, 22:36

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] The Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party, which was just concluded, first proposed ""governance governance"" for Hong Kong and Macao. Later, the CCP officials further explained that they should ""improve the appointment and dismissal system of the Chief Executive of the SAR."" The outside world is worried that the CCP may have to run counter to the ""double suffrage"" demanded by the Hong Kong people.
The Fourth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China issued on October 31 stated that it is necessary to ""administer governance"" to Hong Kong and Macao in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law, and to ""establish a sound legal system and enforcement mechanism for special administrative regions to safeguard national security.""
On November 1st, at the press conference of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, Shen Chunyao, Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Basic Law Committee, further elaborated on the contents of the communique. He stressed that it is necessary to adhere to the ""Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong"" and ""Macao people governing Macao"" with ""Patriots as the mainstay"", and at the same time strengthen the ""Constitution and Basic Law Education"" and ""National Education"" for Hong Kong and Macao public officials and young people, and enhance the Hong Kong and Macao compatriots. ""National consciousness and patriotism.""
Shen Chunyao also mentioned that ""we must improve the central government's system and mechanism for the appointment and removal of chief executives and principal officials of the Special Administrative Region"" and the ""National People's Congress Standing Committee's interpretation system for the Basic Law"" and ""exercise the powers of the Central Committee under the Constitution and the Basic Law."" It is also necessary to ""establish a sound legal system and enforcement mechanism for special administrative regions to safeguard national security"" and support the SAR to ""strengthen law enforcement forces.""
At present, the Hong Kong Chief Executive is nominally elected by an election committee composed of 1,200 people. However, most of the election committee members are controlled by the CCP. The elected chief executive must also be appointed by Beijing, otherwise they will be elected. Nowadays, while strengthening the ""Hong Kong and Macao governance"", the CCP has to ""improve"" the ""appointment and removal system"" of the Chief Executive. The outside world is worried that the ""double suffrage"" demanded by the Hong Kong people will be farther away.
The BBC quoted a mainland historical scholar as saying that the sayings of ""governing Hong Kong and Macao"" and ""national security legislation"" in the Fourth Plenary Session should be the first to show that the CCP may continue to deviate from the so-called ""one country, two systems"" and put the CCP The so-called ""rule of law"" extends to Hong Kong and Macao. Lin Heli, a visiting professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, believes that the Beijing authorities have placed more emphasis on the so-called ""national security"" and that there are no signs of compromise for the people of Hong Kong. The deep-seated contradictions between Hong Kong people and Beijing will intensify.
In addition, directly related to the CCP's ""Performance of the Chief Executive's Appointment and Removal System"", a recent British media report that Beijing is considering the removal of the current Hong Kong Supreme Court, Zheng Yueyue, in March next year, and former Hong Kong Monetary Authority President Chen Delin or former Hong Kong Administrative Director Tang Yingnian ""Interim Chief Executive"". Some Hong Kong media believe that the news is by no means unfounded.
According to the Basic Law of Hong Kong, if the Chief Executive leaves his post early in his term of office, the current Chief Secretary for Administration will act as the Chief Executive until the new Chief Executive is elected. If Beijing decides to appoint another ""interim chief executive"", it is natural to first ""improve the system of appointment and dismissal of the chief executive.""
It is worth mentioning that the current Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Cheung Kin-chung, had publicly apologized to the public after the incident of the triad of the Yuen Long on July 21 this year. As a result, he was threatened by the police and he was ""incompatible"".
