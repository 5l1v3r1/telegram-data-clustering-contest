北京拘留日國立大學教授 中日交流蒙陰影

（中央社記者楊明珠東京1日專電）日本國立北海道大學一位教授9月應中國社會科學院近代史研究所之邀造訪中國，卻遭拘留。東京大學教授高原明生今天投書媒體表示，此事為日本學界及研究機關帶來大衝擊。
高原明生投書「朝日新聞」說，以前有在日本的大學教書的中國學者在中國遭拘留，所屬的學會以理事長名義發出聲明表達憂心。那些被拘留的學者，最長幾個月就被釋放回日本。但近年來，有13名日本籍的男女在中國遭拘留、逮捕、起訴，甚至被判刑。
10月23日，日本首相安倍晉三會晤到東京參加日皇德仁「即位禮正殿之儀」的中華人民共和國副主席王岐山時，要求北京早日釋放遭拘留的日本人。
高原說，目前不知這位北海道大學教授被拘押的理由，但研究歷史的學者在進行研究活動時遭拘留，人身自由長時間被剝奪，將導致中日無法友好交流。此事已讓日本學界感受極大的衝擊。
他說，安倍政府上台之初，中日關係被說成二戰後最嚴峻的時刻，後來也因為兩國領袖的努力而改善到目前的水準，但中日關係有強韌的一面也有脆弱的一面，如果雙方不細心維護，好不容易累積而成的合作小石可能瞬間崩毀。
有關這次日本學者遭拘留一事，高原呼籲有關單位嚴正以對，如果放任此狀態不管，他不知日本能否營造出歡迎中華人民共和國主席習近平明春訪日的氣氛。
高原說，在中國被拘留的案例不限於日本人，也發生在外國人身上。背景是因為中國加強國家安全法制，以前不視為問題的，現在加強取締。曾有日本的研究人員在機場遭拒絕入境或在調查研究的現場遭拘留，但不久後就獲釋。這次情況不同，這是首度有研究中國史的日本學者遭到拘留。
長期研究中國政治的高原說，中日建交至今47年，令人遺憾的是兩國民眾的相互理解並沒太深，這也是造成中日關係不安定的根本原因。為此，中日兩國領袖都同意推展市民層級的交流。不久前媒體報導，在日本訪問的王岐山與前首相福田康夫會晤時，兩人同意要促進學術在內的文化交流。
高原在投書中表示，中國拘留接受中國官方研究所之邀前去交流的日本學者，卻完全不公開相關資訊，再這樣下去，中國被認為是恐怖國家的印象會在日本急速加深。目前取消訪問中國或重新評估中日交流的動向已漸擴大，在中美漸趨對立的情況下，日益重要的中日經濟交流勢必會受影響。（編輯：郭中翰）1081101

Professor of National University of Beijing Detention Day
01 Nov 2019, 22:27 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Yang Mingzhu, Tokyo, 1st) A professor at the National University of Hokkaido in Japan visited China in September at the invitation of the Institute of Modern History of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, but was detained. The University of Tokyo professor Highlander Mingsheng said today that the incident has brought a big impact on Japanese academics and research institutions.
The Asahi Shimbun’s book, Asahi Shimbun, said that Chinese scholars who had previously taught at universities in Japan were detained in China, and the affiliated society issued a statement in the name of the chairman to express concern. Those detained scholars were released back to Japan for the longest months. However, in recent years, 13 Japanese men and women have been detained, arrested, prosecuted and even sentenced in China.
On October 23, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with Tokyo’s Vice-President of the People’s Republic of China, Wang Qishan, who was in Tokyo to participate in the Japanese Emperor Deren’s “Imperial Ceremony of the Emperor’s Court” and asked Beijing to release the detained Japanese at an early date.
The plateau said that the reason why the professor of Hokkaido University was detained is not known, but scholars who study history are detained while conducting research activities. The long-term deprivation of personal freedom will lead to the inability to communicate friendlyly between China and Japan. This matter has already made the Japanese academic community feel a great impact.
He said that at the beginning of the Abe administration, Sino-Japanese relations were described as the most severe moment after World War II. Later, because of the efforts of the leaders of the two countries, they have improved to the current level, but Sino-Japanese relations have a strong side and a fragile side. If the two sides do not carefully maintain, the cooperative small stone that has accumulated so much may collapse in an instant.
Regarding the detention of Japanese scholars this time, the plateau called on the relevant units to be right and right. If left unchecked, he does not know whether Japan can create an atmosphere that welcomes President Xi Jinping’s visit to Japan in the spring.
The plateau said that the cases of detention in China are not limited to Japanese, but also to foreigners. The background is because China has strengthened the national security legal system, which was not regarded as a problem before, and now it is banned. Japanese researchers were denied entry at the airport or were detained at the site of the investigation, but were released shortly afterwards. This time, the situation is different. This is the first time that Japanese scholars who have studied Chinese history have been detained.
The plateau that has long studied Chinese politics said that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan for 47 years, it is regrettable that the mutual understanding between the two peoples is not too deep. This is also the fundamental reason for the instability of Sino-Japanese relations. To this end, the leaders of both China and Japan agreed to promote exchanges at the citizen level. Not long ago, the media reported that when Wang Qishan, who was visiting Japan, met with former Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, the two agreed to promote cultural exchanges such as academics.
The plateau said in the book that the Japanese scholars who were detained in China to accept the invitation of the Chinese official research institute did not disclose relevant information at all. If this continues, the impression that China is considered a terrorist country will rapidly deepen in Japan. The current trend of canceling visits to China or reassessing Sino-Japanese exchanges has gradually expanded. As China and the United States become increasingly antagonistic, the increasingly important Sino-Japanese economic exchanges are bound to be affected. (Editor: Guo Zhonghan) 1081101
