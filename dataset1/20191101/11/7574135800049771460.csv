On Halloween night, Frank Ocean hosted the third edition of his ongoing queer club night PrEP+ at Knockdown Center‚Äôs BASEMENT in Maspeth, Queens. Arca, who played the previous party, was the host, and the lineup included Joey Labeija, Vegyn, Last Japan, and DJ Heather. Since it was Halloween, plenty of guests were in costume, and Frank himself arrived as Sweet Tooth, the clown mascot from the Twisted Metal video game series (seen above).
Aside from celebrating the holiday in style, Frank seemingly previewed even more new music last night. In two different videos uploaded to Reddit, Frank played a trap-leaning new track, which some fans speculated was similar to a snippet heard during one of his Instagram stories last year.
You can watch clips of the new song, and other videos taken at the party, below. The only proper single Frank has released so far this year is the Boys Noize-produced ‚ÄúDHL.‚Äù
