在台南打造台灣人的「迪士尼」，魏德聖「豐盛之城」BOT啟動、2025完工
01 Nov 2019, 11:18 by Abby Huang


我們想讓你知道的是魏德聖當年的《海角七號》、《賽德克巴萊》的電影場景，都吸引不少人氣與觀光收益，這次斥資135億元在台南打造主題樂園，未來成績備受外界期待。



台灣導演魏德聖籌備多年、備受矚目的影城樂園計畫，終於在今（1）日正式底定，魏德聖與台南市長黃偉哲簽約，將與台南市政府合作重現400年前的台江內海樣貌，斥資135億在台南打造「豐盛之城」歷史文化園區，預計2025年完成，場景將永遠保留。
導演魏德聖新片《台灣三部曲》正在籌備中，為了在片中重現400年前荷蘭人初到台灣的景象，劇組將在台南烏樹林糖廠北邊118公頃土地上，挖出一片「台江內海」，搭建永久性場景，並保留轉型為「豐盛之城」歷史文化園區，預計2025年完工。
「台灣三部曲歷史文化園區」於去（2018）年6月獲行政院正式核定為國家重大文化建設計畫，今日正式與台南市政府簽署園區BOT案合約。魏德聖致詞時表達團隊開啟這項計畫的初衷：「我們在這片土地出生、長大、死亡、埋葬，用一百多公頃的土地來紀念臺灣這位大地之母，一點都不浪費。」團隊希望建造一座讓臺灣可以被國際認識、被後代永遠紀念的園區。
「豐盛之城」BOT案為50年，可續約20年，總預算135億，採取分階段籌資，現階段至2020年底的籌資目標為20億，將在2021年開始動土，並鎖定荷蘭人來台400周年的隔年2025年暑假開園。魏德聖在11月1日與台南市政府公開簽約，並正式對外募資，並進行環評、水保以及土地變更等程序。
上百億的壓力往自己身上掛
《自由時報》報導，魏德聖表示，這幾週壓力真的非常大，「很緊張、很猶豫。因為我知道今天這個約一簽下去，就是把上百億的壓力往自己身上掛上了。」不過他也表示，「2024年對我來說是一個很急迫的年份，正好是台灣400年整，是西拉雅族、明朝漢人、以及荷蘭人在這邊匯聚的時間點，這是我們生命源頭的那個年份，特別覺得那個時間點應該被紀念下來」。
《ETtoday》報導，魏德聖透露，在寫完《賽德克巴萊》劇本的最後一天，突然內心想著：「我的歷史呢？」因此開始構思《台灣三部曲》，分別是首部曲《火焚之軀》（講述西拉雅獵鹿勇士沙喃）、二部曲《鯨骨之海》（講述漢人海盜郭懷一）、三部曲《應許之地》（講述荷蘭傳教士楊恩）。三部曲皆以荷蘭侵台開場、鄭成功攻台收尾，用3種不同的觀點說故事，還有延伸動畫片《達娜米》、紀錄片《尋找福爾摩莎》。
依照《台灣三部曲》主要場景規畫的「豐盛之城」，將以台灣400年前為時空背景，打造1片海洋、2座城堡、3種文化、4個主題村，以1比1的規模，重建台江內海、熱蘭遮城、普羅民遮城、大灣市鎮以及赤崁漢人聚落、海盜村以及西拉雅部落。

不讓台灣電影場景只有7天壽命
為何重金也在所不惜，就是要打造17世紀的台南景色？魏德聖表示，他「想要讓全台灣的人看看，我們住的這個地方，它剛出生的樣子，應該是什麼樣子。」
魏德聖日前受訪時表示，拍完《賽德克巴萊》之後，覺得台灣電影產業像是「毛毛蟲」，花了很多時間孵化成為蝴蝶，卻只有短短7天的綻放時間，他不希望變成這樣，而是把夢的餅做大，讓電影拍完可以有東西留下來，還有可以長久放映的地方，也希望因為這3部電影，帶動台灣社會對於藝術、文化的重視，未來包括外國人，都一定要來這裡「感覺一下，什麼是台灣的開始」。



《遠見雜誌》報導，魏德聖當年的《海角七號》，讓「阿嘉的家」遊客紀錄最高一個月達到52萬人次、恆春的產值一年達到40億元，當時還有各種電影套裝行程；而《賽德克巴萊》的霧社街，當年在拆除之前開放了半年，就吸引了38萬人次，光門票收入就高達7500萬元──因此「豐盛之城」的效益，勢必能有非常可觀的成績。
魏德聖認為，在整個亞洲，光迪士尼樂園就遍佈於東京、香港、上海，環球影城也在大阪、新加坡有據點，這密度讓台灣已經「不需要再有相同的遊樂園」。他期盼未來「豐盛之城」完工後，能「不要摩天輪、不要雲霄飛車，我想用更有文化的東西創造歷史，台灣要的不是迪士尼樂園，而是最能代表這塊土地的回憶。」

Taiwanese director Wei Desheng has been preparing for the multi-year and high-profile cinema paradise project. It is finally officially decided today (1) that Wei Desheng signed a contract with Tainan Mayor Huang Weizhe to reproduce the Taijiang inner sea 400 years ago in cooperation with the Tainan Municipal Government. It looks like a total of 13.5 billion yuan to build a ""rich city"" historical and cultural park in Tainan. It is expected to be completed in 2025 and the scene will be preserved forever.
Director Wei Desheng's new film ""Taiwan Trilogy"" is in the process of preparation. In order to reproduce the scene of the Dutchman's first arrival in Taiwan 400 years ago, the crew will dig a piece of ""Taijiang River"" on 118 hectares of land in the north of Tainan Wushu Sugar Factory. Inland Sea, building a permanent scene, and retaining the transformation into a ""rich city"" historical and cultural park, is expected to be completed in 2025.
The ""Taiwan Trilogy History and Culture Park"" was officially approved by the Executive Yuan as a national major cultural construction design painting in June 2018. Today, it officially signed a contract with the Tainan Municipal Government for the BOT case. When Wei Desheng delivered a speech, he expressed the original intention of the team to open the project: ""We were born, raised, died, buried in this land, and used more than 100 hectares of land to commemorate the mother of Taiwan, which is not wasted."" I hope to build a park that allows Taiwan to be recognized by the international community and commemorated forever by future generations.
The ""Buddhist City"" BOT case is 50 years, can be renewed for 20 years, with a total budget of 13.5 billion. It will be funded in stages. At this stage, the fundraising target will be 2 billion by the end of 2020. It will start in 2021 and lock the Dutch. The summer of the 400th anniversary of coming to Taiwan will open in the summer of 2025. Wei Desheng signed a contract with the Tainan Municipal Government on November 1st, and officially raised funds, and carried out procedures such as environmental assessment, water conservation and land change.
Thousands of pressures hang on themselves
""Free Times"" reported that Wei Desheng said that the pressure in these weeks was really very big. ""It is very nervous and hesitant. Because I know that today, when I signed this one, I put the pressure of tens of billions on myself."" However, he also said, ""2024 is a very urgent year for me. It is exactly 400 years in Taiwan. It is the time for the Silaya, the Ming Dynasty, and the Dutch to gather here. This is us. In the year of the source of life, I especially felt that the point in time should be commemorated.""
""ETtoday"" reported that Wei Desheng revealed that on the last day of writing the ""Sidek Bale"" script, he suddenly thought: ""What is my history?"" So I began to conceive the ""Taiwan Trilogy"", which is the first song. The Burning Body (telling the Silaya Deer Warrior Sharan), the second song ""The Whale Bone Sea"" (telling the Chinese pirate Guo Huaiyi), and the trilogy ""The Promised Land"" (telling the Dutch missionary Yang En). The trilogy begins with the Dutch invasion of Taiwan, Zheng Chenggong's attack on the stage, and the story is told in three different perspectives, as well as the extended cartoon ""Danami"" and the documentary ""Looking for Formosa"".
According to the main scene of the ""Taiwan Trilogy"", the ""City of the Rich"" will create a piece of ocean, two castles, three cultures and four theme villages with a 1:1 background. The scale of the reconstruction of the Taijiang inland sea, the hot blue city, the Promenade, the city of Dawan, as well as the Chikan Han people settlement, the pirate village and the Silaya tribe.

Do not let the Taiwanese movie scene only have a 7-day life
Why do you want to build a 17th-century Tainan scenery? Wei Desheng said that he ""wanted to let people all over Taiwan look at the place where we live, what it should be like when we were born.""
Wei Desheng said in a recent interview that after filming ""Sidek Bale"", he felt that the Taiwanese film industry was like a ""caterpillar"" and spent a lot of time incubating into a butterfly, but only a short 7-day bloom time, he did not want Becoming like this, but making the cake of dreams bigger, letting the film be filmed, there are things to stay, and there are places that can be shown for a long time. I hope that because of these three films, Taiwan’s society will pay attention to art and culture, and the future will include Foreigners must come here to ""feel what is the beginning of Taiwan.""



""Vision Magazine"" reported that Wei Desheng's ""Cape No.7"" made the record of ""Ajia's Home"" up to 520,000 people in one month and Hengchun's output value reached 4 billion yuan a year. At that time, there were various movie package trips. The Wushe Street of ""Sidek Bale"", which was opened for half a year before the demolition, attracted 380,000 people, and the ticket sales revenue was as high as 75 million yuan - so the benefits of the ""rich city"" are bound to There are very impressive results.
Wei Desheng believes that throughout Asia, Disneyland is located in Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. Universal Studios also has a stronghold in Osaka and Singapore. This density has made Taiwan ""no need to have the same amusement park."" He hopes that after the completion of the ""City of the Rich City"" in the future, ""I don't want the Ferris wheel, don't fly the sky, I want to create history with more cultural things. What Taiwan wants is not Disneyland, but the memory that best represents this land. .""
