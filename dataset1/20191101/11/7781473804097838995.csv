The body shell and the footwell of the Redi-Go were rated 'unstable'. The head protection for the passenger was good while the head protection for driver was adequate due to the steering wheel displacement. The chest protection for the driver was weak and was marginal for the passenger. It was also brought to notice that the Redi-Go was not equipped with a 3-point seatbelt with automatic retractors for all occupants.



The child occupant protection showed poor results as well. The head of the 18-month-old dummy collided with the front seat and the exposed head of the 3-year-old dummy during the impact was the main reason for low ratings.



The Datsun Redi-GO hatchback is due for an upgrade and is expected to be out before March 2020.

Also, the engine is expected to go under necessary revision considering the deadline to meet the upcoming BSVI norms is closing in.
