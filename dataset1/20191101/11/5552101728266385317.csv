女星扮「安娜貝爾」嚇壞路人　渡過難忘萬聖節
01 Nov 2019, 11:17 by 娛樂組
舒子晨近日推出首張EP《RED ANGEL》，受邀至OMNI TAIPEI和大家共度萬聖節，並化身「RED ANGEL」，讓現場嗨翻天。她演出完，大喊：「感覺我出運了啦！」她透露，出道前半工半讀擔任過舞者，因而此次現場演出完全不怯場，感謝那陣子的訓練。
為了此次萬聖節的演出，舒子晨特地找化妝師討論，並化出「天使的眼淚」眼妝，展現帥氣的一面。她說：「以往幾年也是在工作，算是打工，但這次是『作為歌手的舒子晨』受邀演出，覺得有種『我出運了』的感覺。」
舒子晨回憶六年前大學剛畢業時，和朋友一起為萬聖節扮裝出遊：「其實扮裝很好玩耶，但那次全世界都不想理我。」原來她找了朋友化特殊妝，並扮成當年最火紅的「安娜貝爾」，因效果太過逼真，在路邊攔車卻沒有計程車司機願意停下來載她，她只好待在冷風中半個小時，「當時感覺被台北遺棄了！」
不僅如此，走在人行道上，行人也刻意繞開她而走，最後她乾脆就地坐下安靜演出「安娜貝爾洋娃娃」，有人經過立刻跳起來張牙舞爪，成功嚇壞不少人。舒子晨得意地說：「這應該是我最難忘的萬聖節了，雖然全世界都不想理我，印象超深刻，但很好笑，玩得超開心的！」
