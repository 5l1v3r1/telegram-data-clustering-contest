Former Barcelona player Javier Mascherano is one of the players being targetted by new Major League Soccer franchise Inter Miami, who are owned by David Beckham.
Reports in Argentina this week have suggested that the Argentine midfielder, who left Barça for Hebei Fortune in the Chinese Super League, is now looking for a new challenge with his contract set to expire.
Journalist Cesar Luis Merlo reported that Inter Miami are keen on him and SPORT have been able to confirm that there is an offer on the table.
A source close to Mascherano has said there the American side have made contact and that he is ""close"" to signing a deal with Beckham's franchise, who will join MLS in 2020.
At 35, there's an element of risk to signing Mascherano, who's best days are behind him. However, he offers experience and character to a relatively young team that is being constructed.
So far, Inter Miami have announced five signings but they have not named a coach. It's been speculated that former Real Madrid coach Santiago Solari is an option.
