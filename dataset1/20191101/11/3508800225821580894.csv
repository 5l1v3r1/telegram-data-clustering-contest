印太戰略玩假？川普繼續缺席東協峰會，中國力挺RCEP完成在即
01 Nov 2019, 11:18 by 關鍵評論網 ASEAN：Indochina


我們想讓你知道的是雖然五角大廈今年的戰略報告把印太列為「美國未來最重要的單一地區」，但美國總統川普連續三年未參與東亞峰會。因此在中國對南海的影響力日漸增強心，東協國家對美國的亞太承諾表達憂心。而牛步化頗久的RCEP貿易協定，目前氣氛樂觀。



隨著東協峰會（ASEAN Summit）與東亞峰會（East Asia Summit）將分別在11月2日與4日在泰國曼谷舉行，除了南海主權議題與「區域全面經濟夥伴關係協定」（RCEP）兩大焦點議題外，美國總統川普連續三年缺席、美國派出位階較低的政府代表出席也成為話題。
《中央社》報導，美國降低本週在泰國曼舉辦的「美國－東南亞國家協會峰會」（US-ASEAN Summit）和東亞峰會（East Asia Summit）的代表團層級，勢必會讓擔心中國影響力日形擴大的亞洲盟邦感失望。
此次，川普指派國家安全顧問歐布萊恩（Robert O'Brien）出任兩場峰會的特使，而商務部長羅斯（Wilbur Ross）則是將參加在東亞峰會場邊舉行、集結政府官員和商界主管的印太商務論壇（Indo-Pacific Business Forum），《外交家》報導，於11月3日到8日間，羅斯將率領貿易組織代表團與泰國、印尼與越南相關單位進行磋商。該文同時指出，此次美國送出的代表團層級降低。
美國總統川普原定出席11月中在智利舉行的亞太經濟合作會議（APEC），雖然智利當局基於國內民眾示威的局勢擴大而宣布取消舉辦APEC，但川普不會出席曼谷的會議幾乎成定局。中國總理李克強、日本首相安倍晉三、俄羅斯總理梅德韋傑夫和南韓總統文在寅會出席此次東亞峰會，而川普的缺席將使中國有機會在前線推動東南亞的政策議程。
報導指出，雖然五角大廈今年的戰略報告把印太列為「美國未來最重要的單一地區」，但川普卻不斷降低美國—東南亞國家協會峰會和東亞峰會代表團層級。川普曾在2017年參加在菲律賓馬尼拉舉行的美國－東南亞國家協會峰會，不過東亞峰會川普從未全程參與，而2018年在新加坡舉行的東亞峰會，則是由美國副總統彭斯（Mike Pence）率團。
外交界人士和分析家表示，川普2017年上任後，旋即退出了跨太平洋夥伴協定（TPP），如今缺席在曼谷舉行的東亞峰會，將讓人質疑美國的亞太承諾。而亞洲外交界人士也表達對美國的亞太承諾的擔憂，因為區域國家日益憂心中國影響力的迅速擴大。《日經亞洲週刊》報導，相比於2018年美國是派副總統彭斯出席東亞峰會，今年的代表團的明顯降級，泰國朱拉隆功大學東協中心學術事務主任Piti Srisangnam認為，這意味著東協對美國而言並不重要。
在東亞峰會舉行前的南海局勢進展也印證了區域國家對中國影響力的擔憂。中央社報導，10月28日菲律賓和中國已就南海油氣開發合作取得進展，雙方成功在北京召開「菲中油氣開發合作政府間聯合指導委員會」首次會議後，宣布委員會正式成立，以及宣布同意將於2020年初，在菲律賓舉行油氣開發聯合指導委員會第2次會議。
《日經亞洲週刊》報導，北京方面正在與東協協商南海行為準則，中國已經加入排除該區域以外成員進行干預的字句、企圖阻擋美國涉入。綜合《馬尼拉時報》與《高棉時報》報導，菲律賓總統杜特蒂可望在此次峰會中力促完成延宕多時的南海行為準則，但柬埔寨政府態度則是「想看到準則完成，但會採取中立立場」。
印度總理亮綠燈，RCEP周一宣布初步結果有望
除了南海行為準則外，此次峰會也將試圖完成自2013年就陷入牛步的「區域全面經濟夥伴關係協定」（RCEP）。週五（11/1）以部長級會議起跑，目前已經針對該協定中大多章節已達成協議，但在「關稅」「電子商務」等領域，還存在著鴻溝，特別是印度，擔憂降低關稅將使得該國與中國之間的龐大貿易逆差持續擴大。
印度外交部發言人在週四記者會時表示，有部分關鍵議題仍待解決，「印度依舊參與其中，試圖找到解決方法，我們期待在部長級會議與RCEP高峰會後，能見度會大增。」《NBC》報導，歐亞集團分析師認為這意味著印度總理莫迪終於首肯讓協商代表尋求達成「大幅度結論」。
《曼谷郵報》則是報導，東協經濟共同體理事會於本周四（10/31）開會，會後泰國副總理兼商業部長朱林（Jurin Laksanawisit）表示，東協十國與6個貿易成員國均對完成RCEP抱持樂觀態度，目前20個章節中尚有6個章節有待取得共識，包含貿易競爭規則、減緩副作用的方式等等，若達成共識，週一（11/4）各國領袖則可望共同宣布初步成果。
中國支持的RCEP通常被視為是美國主導的泛太平洋夥伴協議（Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP）之對抗者。若RCEP生效，這個由東協十國與中國、日本、南韓、印度、澳洲與紐西蘭六國共同組成的自由貿易區將囊擴全球近半人口以及近3成的全球貿易量。

Yintai strategic play fake? Trump continues to miss the ASEAN summit, China is steadily completing the RCEP
01 Nov 2019, 11:18 by Key Commentary ASEAN: Indochina


What we want you to know is that although the Pentagon's strategic report this year listed India as ""the most important single region of the United States in the future,"" US President Trump did not participate in the East Asia Summit for three consecutive years. Therefore, China’s influence on the South China Sea is growing, and the ASEAN countries are worried about the US’s Asia-Pacific commitment. The long-awaited RCEP trade agreement is currently optimistic.



ASEAN Summit and East Asia Summit will be held in Bangkok, Thailand on November 2nd and 4th, respectively, in addition to the South China Sea sovereignty issue and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP). In addition to the focus issue, the absence of US President Trump for three consecutive years and the presence of lower government representatives from the United States have also become topics.
""Central News"" reported that the United States lowered the level of the delegation of the ""US-ASEAN Summit"" and the East Asia Summit held this week in Thailand, and it is bound to worry about China's influence. The expanding Asian allies are disappointed.
This time, Trump appointed National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien as the special envoy of the two summits, while Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will participate in the East Asia Summit to gather government officials and business executives. The Indo-Pacific Business Forum, the Diplomat, reported that between November 3 and 8, Ross will lead a trade organization delegation to negotiate with relevant units in Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. The article also pointed out that the level of delegation sent by the United States has decreased.
US President Trump was scheduled to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (APEC) held in Chile in mid-November. Although the Chilean authorities announced the cancellation of the APEC based on the expansion of the domestic demonstrations, Trump’s failure to attend the Bangkok meeting is almost a foregone conclusion. . Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and South Korean President Wen will attend the East Asia Summit, and Trump’s absence will give China the opportunity to promote Southeast Asia’s policy agenda on the front line.
The report pointed out that although the Pentagon's strategic report this year listed India as ""the most important single region of the United States in the future,"" Trump continued to lower the level of the US-Southeast Asian Association Summit and the East Asia Summit. Trump participated in the US-ASEAN Summit in Manila, Philippines in 2017, but the East Asia Summit Trump has never participated in the whole process, and the East Asia Summit in Singapore in 2018 was attended by US Vice President Mike Pence. ) led the group.
Diplomats and analysts said that Trump immediately withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) after taking office in 2017. The absence of the East Asia Summit in Bangkok will raise questions about US Asia-Pacific commitments. Asian diplomats also expressed concern about the US's Asia-Pacific commitment, as regional countries are increasingly worried about the rapid expansion of China's influence. According to Nikkei Asia Weekly, compared with 2018, when the United States sent Vice President Peng Si to attend the East Asia Summit, this year’s delegation was significantly downgraded. Piti Srisangnam, director of academic affairs at the East Asia Center of Chulalongkorn University in Thailand, believes that this means The ASEAN is not important to the United States.
The progress in the South China Sea before the East Asia Summit also confirmed the concerns of regional countries on China's influence. The Central News Agency reported that on October 28, the Philippines and China have made progress in oil and gas development cooperation in the South China Sea. The two sides successfully held the first meeting of the ""Intergovernmental Joint Steering Committee of the Philippines-China Oil and Gas Development Cooperation"" in Beijing, and announced the formal establishment of the committee and announced that it will be At the beginning of 2020, the second meeting of the Joint Steering Committee on Oil and Gas Development was held in the Philippines.
The Nikkei Asia Weekly reported that Beijing is negotiating with the ASEAN on the South China Sea Code of Conduct. China has joined the words that exclude members from outside the region to intervene in an attempt to block US involvement. According to the ""Manila Times"" and the ""Khmer Times"" report, Philippine President Dutti is expected to promote the long-awaited South China Sea Code of Conduct at the summit, but the attitude of the Cambodian government is ""I want to see the completion of the guidelines, but will Take a neutral stance.""
Indian Prime Minister shines green, RCEP announces preliminary results on Monday
In addition to the South China Sea Code of Conduct, the summit will also attempt to complete the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP), which has been in the forefront since 2013. Friday (11/1) started as a ministerial meeting and has already reached an agreement on most of the chapters in the agreement, but there are still gaps in the areas of ""tariffs"" and ""e-commerce"", especially India, worried about lowering tariffs. The huge trade deficit between the country and China continues to expand.
A spokesman for the Indian Foreign Ministry said at a press conference on Thursday that some key issues remain to be resolved. ""India is still involved and trying to find a solution. We expect that visibility will increase after the ministerial meeting and the RCEP summit."" According to NBC, analysts at the Eurasian Group believe that this means that Indian Prime Minister Modi has finally agreed to let the negotiators seek to reach a ""significant conclusion.""
The Bangkok Post reported that the ASEAN Economic Community Council met on Thursday (10/31). After the meeting, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Commerce Julin Laksanawisit said that the ASEAN 10 countries and six trade members The average country is optimistic about the completion of RCEP. There are still 6 chapters in the 20 chapters to be agreed upon, including trade competition rules, ways to mitigate side effects, etc. If consensus is reached, Monday (11/4) leaders of all countries It is expected to jointly announce the initial results.
China-backed RCEPs are often seen as the opponents of the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). If the RCEP takes effect, the free trade zone composed of the 10 ASEAN countries and China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand will expand nearly half of the world's population and nearly 30% of global trade.
