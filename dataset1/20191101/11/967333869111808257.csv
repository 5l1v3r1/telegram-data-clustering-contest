Off With His Head! Thai Princess Heats Up Social Media By Holding Severed Trump Head on Halloween
01 Nov 2019, 11:34 by by Svetlana Ekimenko

68-year-old Princess Ubolratana of Thailand had been posting images of her various Halloween outfits on social media, dressing up as characters ranging from Disney’s Maleficent to a fortune teller, before sharing a controversial image of the US President.

Princess Ubolratana of Thailand unleashed a controversy on social networks on Thursday after an Instagram post showed her to be holding a rubber head resembling that of US President Donald Trump, covered in bloody wounds.
The 68-year-old woman had initially been publishing photos of herself in various Halloween outfits.
The image posted by King Maha Vajiralongkorn's older sister on her private account bore the comment ""Happy Halloween in Sampeng! "", in reference to a market situated in the Chinatown of Bangkok.



Social media reactions to the controversial post ranged from people lambasting it as “disgusting,” and “deranged”…












Others saw it as a hilarious, if pointed, Halloween prank. 






​Some social media fans referenced an incident involving US comedian Kathy Griffin, who found herself in hot water in 2016 after she held a bloodied, disembodied Trump head aloft for a photo stunt.






​​Many commenters suspected the controversial post was in response to the recent US suspension of certain Thai trade preferences.









​Earlier, the Office of the United States Trade Representative announced 25 October it was suspending $1.3 billion in trade preferences for Thailand under the Generalised System of Preferences, or GSP, because of its failure to adequately protect worker rights.
Thailand has faced complaints for years over labour issues, particularly in its fisheries industry.
Keerati Rushchano, acting director-general of the Commerce Ministry’s Foreign Trade Department, said on 28 October that Thailand will try to negotiate the issue before it takes effect in April, as did Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha in separate remarks Monday.
The US Trade Representative’s announcement said the GSP eligibility was open to periodic review.
