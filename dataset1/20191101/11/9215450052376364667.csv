股息投資唔止揀高息股 想成功仲要留意現金流｜關穎嫻

在低息時代，股息投資成為投資者的熱門話題，皆因市場波動劇烈，令投資者難以達至資本增值及取得持續收益。不過，股息投資並不止是單單挑選出高息股，而是要從估值以外的角度思考。許多投資者在挑選優質收息股時，多側重於擁有長期派息紀錄的公司。然而這只是第一步，以下是選股時應納入考慮的因素。管理層一直秉持派息文化的公司，許多必需消費品企業都符合這條件。

部分房託受惠低息環境
可以留意現金流充裕、增長穩健，兼願意增加派息的科技公司。重新重視資本支出紀律的行業，例如鐵礦開採行業已停止增加投入資本，轉而把自由現金流用作派息之用。管理完善的房地產投資信託基金（REITs）。部分 REITs如數據處理中心，利用長期債券為雲端相關的增長融資，能受惠於當前的低息環境。
筆者認為股息投資成功之道，還得深入分析公司的資產負債表。意思是挑選出擁有穩健資產負債表、並無過度借貸，兼能保持增長及收益的公司。分析現金流及資產負債表是很重要的一環，有助投資者更透徹了解公司的整體資本結構。投資者在2007至2008年環球金融危機中上了寶貴一課。當時幾間高度槓桿的公司無法透過借貸進行融資，而依賴短期資金、貨幣市場基金或短期金融工具的公司亦大受影響。於是，許多高槓桿公司要大幅削減派息甚或全面取消派息，令股息投資者大受打擊。
表面上，股息投資就是以息高取勝，事實卻非如此簡單，找出有能力提升派息率的公司同樣重要。研究發現，派息及派息增長率高於市場平均的公司，長線有望跑贏大市。過往，投資者最常在美國及歐洲市場找到「股息增長股」，不過這情況正在改變，愈來愈多亞洲公司更懂得創造現金流，在股東回報及企業管治方面亦有所提升。日本和中國這兩大亞洲市場都進行了改革，鼓勵公司增加派息。
相較於以往，如今日本企業更加著重股東回報及創造現金流，許多日本公司正進行結構性改革，釋放了更多資金與股東共享業務成果。在中國市場亦見到類似的趨勢。有意分散風險及保護本金的股息投資者，可考慮在組合裏加入債券資產，原因是投資級別債券及美國國債跟股市的相關性較低，能有效穩定組合的表現。
長遠而言，雲端計算及第五代流動電話（5G）相關的資本支出料會持續。愈來愈多公司把相關運作外判予雲端服務供應商，從而提升生產力及節省成本。下一代的業務提升如自動化、數據分析及機械學習，將為企業帶來高增值發展，擁有雲端基建的公司昂然踏入收成期。另一方面，全球5G無線服務的發展雖仍處於初期，不過許多電訊公司，正積極投資建設無線發射站及小型基站，為未來發展5G鋪路。未來幾年5G相關的資本投入將出現強勁增長，是投資者應密切注視的大趨勢。

Dividend investment, picking up high-yield stocks, wanting success, paying attention to cash flow | Guan Yingwei
01 Nov 2019, 11:18 by Investment
In the low interest era, dividend investment has become a hot topic for investors. Due to the volatility of the market, it is difficult for investors to achieve capital appreciation and sustainable income. However, dividend investment is not just about picking up high-yielding stocks, but thinking about it from a different perspective. Many investors focus on companies with long-term dividend payouts when selecting high-quality dividend stocks. However, this is only the first step. The following are the factors that should be taken into account when selecting stocks. The management has always been a company with a dividend-paying culture, and many consumer goods companies meet these conditions.

Some housings benefit from a low interest environment
You can pay attention to technology companies with sufficient cash flow, stable growth, and willing to increase dividends. Industries that re-emphasize capital expenditure discipline, such as the iron ore mining industry, have stopped increasing their investment capital and have used free cash flow as a dividend. Well-managed real estate investment trusts (REITs). Some REITs, such as data processing centers, use long-term bonds to finance cloud-related growth and benefit from the current low interest rate environment.
The author believes that the success of dividend investment, but also have to analyze the company's balance sheet. It means picking out companies that have a solid balance sheet and that don't over-borrow and maintain growth and profitability. Analyzing cash flow and balance sheets is an important part of helping investors better understand the company's overall capital structure. Investors took a valuable lesson in the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. At that time, several highly leveraged companies were unable to finance through borrowing, and companies that relied on short-term funds, money market funds or short-term financial instruments were also greatly affected. As a result, many highly leveraged companies have to cut dividends or even cancel dividends altogether, which has hurt dividend investors.
On the surface, dividend investment is to win at a high interest rate. The fact is not so simple. It is equally important to find a company that has the ability to raise the dividend payout ratio. The study found that companies with dividends and dividend payouts higher than the market average are expected to outperform the market. In the past, investors have often found “dividend growth stocks” in the US and European markets, but this is changing. More and more Asian companies are more aware of creating cash flow and improving shareholder returns and corporate governance. The two Asian markets, Japan and China, have undergone reforms to encourage companies to increase dividends.
Compared with the past, Japanese companies are now more focused on shareholder returns and creating cash flow. Many Japanese companies are undergoing structural reforms, releasing more funds to share business results with shareholders. Similar trends have also been seen in the Chinese market. Dividend investors interested in diversifying risk and protecting the principal may consider adding bond assets to the portfolio because investment-grade bonds and US Treasury bonds are less relevant to the stock market and can effectively stabilize the performance of the portfolio.
In the long run, cloud computing and capital expenditures related to fifth-generation mobile phones (5G) are expected to continue. More and more companies outsource related operations to cloud service providers to increase productivity and save costs. The next generation of business enhancements such as automation, data analysis and mechanical learning will bring high value-added development to enterprises, and companies with cloud infrastructure will enter the harvest period. On the other hand, although the development of global 5G wireless services is still in its infancy, many telecommunications companies are actively investing in building wireless transmitting stations and small base stations to pave the way for the future development of 5G. The 5G-related capital investment will show strong growth in the next few years, which is a general trend that investors should pay close attention to.
