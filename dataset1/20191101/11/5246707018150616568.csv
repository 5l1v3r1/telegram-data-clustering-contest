UK indie studio Atomicom has revealed that House of Golf, a brand new arcade-style golf game, is headed exclusively to Nintendo Switch next week.
Boasting full 3D graphics and ""easy pick-up-and-play mechanics"", House of Golf will have players facing a variety of holes across home-based locations. You can see it in action in the trailer above - the whole thing reminds us of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's adorable Ribbon Road race track.
Here's a list of game features and screenshots for you to check out:
House Of Golf features:* Easy to play game mechanics* Real Physics at 60FPS* 135 Levels set across 5 locations* 1-6 Player Couch Play* Large selection of unlockables












The game launches on 8th November, but it'll be going live on the eShop today where you'll be able to make use of a 25% early bird discount. The standard retail price (which will come into effect on launch day) will be £8.99 / $9.99 / €9.99.
