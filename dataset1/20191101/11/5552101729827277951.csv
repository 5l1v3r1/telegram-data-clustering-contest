【Arran威士忌的斜槓思維1】用蘇格蘭最乾淨的水　造出王子的酒
01 Nov 2019, 11:10 by 林亦君, 何宗昇
蘇格蘭人是這樣形容艾倫島的，這個常住居民不到5千人的小島，被高地邊界斷層切割成高地與低地區，島上有山丘、溪流，也有山谷與海岸，簡直就是蘇格蘭的縮影。
英國女王頗眷顧這個小島，不但親自登島為酒廠揭幕，還幫威廉與哈利兩位王子存了酒。我們千里迢迢來到島上，只為了一探島嶼威士忌Arran獨特的斜槓思維。



一路飛行來到蘇格蘭威士忌的最大出口港格拉斯哥，再開車一路往南，1小時後，來到阿德羅森（Ardrossan）渡輪口，連車帶人開上渡輪，沒多久便悠悠晃晃抵達位在蘇格蘭本島和坎培爾鎮中間的艾倫島（Isle of Arran）。
小島上只有一家以島為名的酒廠，若將時空回溯到18世紀，蘇格蘭與英格蘭合併後的政府，開始徵收威士忌稅，在那之前，艾倫島上曾在不同時期擁有50多間非法蒸餾廠。
1820年代，英國政府修改稅法，讓酒廠可以申請合法經營，1825年在島嶼南邊開張的Lagg Distillery即是唯一持有證照的酒廠，可惜後來無法抵擋經營困境，1837年便宣佈關廠。

在Lagg關廠155年之後，起瓦士威士忌（Chivas）的前常務董事Harold Currie和兩個合夥人在1992年發起了在艾倫島上重新創辦酒廠的計畫，1994年選在島嶼西北端的羅赫蘭札（Lochranza）建廠。1995年6月29日下午2點29分，Arran酒廠的蒸餾器開始正式運轉。
雖然是全新酒廠，卻被各界寄予厚望，英國皇室當然是最佳加持者，女王伊莉莎白二世在1997年巡視蘇格蘭西海岸的行程中，特地偷空來到Arran島，為酒廠揭幕，酒廠也送上兩桶威士忌，女王大手一揮，說這兩桶酒不如給兩個孫子喝吧！於是這兩桶酒便被寫上威廉與哈利王子的名字，現在還在酒廠裡沉睡著，等待最好的一天到來。

日本Nikka酒廠創辦人竹鶴威（左二）也曾專程登島拜訪酒廠。

日本威士忌創始者竹鶴政孝的兒子、同時是Nikka酒廠的創辦人竹鶴威也專程來拜訪，同行的還有許多威士忌業界權威人士。而她也不負眾望，2007年就拿下蘇格蘭最佳酒廠的榮譽，各款作品年年摘下國際競賽大獎，讓我們對艾倫島和這個酒廠都充滿好奇。


Arran推出的威士忌曾獲許多國際競賽肯定。

這天一早，Arran亞太區商務總監Rob Gray開車帶我們繞過大半個島來到羅赫蘭札，張開雙臂迎接我們的是Arran酒廠首席調酒師James Mac Taggart，他在2007年加入艾倫，在威士忌業界是個響噹噹的人物，家住在艾雷島，每個星期搭船通勤到艾倫島來上班，只有週末才回家。看似和藹的老先生，年輕時可是一位留長髮、組樂團、彈Keyboard的音樂玩家，現在偶爾也會在音樂祭時彈上幾曲。
一見面，James便驕傲地帶我們走到酒廠旁的小溪，「我們的水源是從Loch Na Davie湖流到這裡，很多年前那是鹿的飲水之處，如果要製作非泥煤風味的威士忌，就會需要非常乾淨的水源，這裡可說是蘇格蘭最優質的水源之一。」他自信地說。


Arran蒸餾廠外觀很樸素，只有頂上的PAGODA洩漏酒廠身份。



這條小溪裡的水，源自Loch Na Davie，許多年，野鹿愛到這個湖裡喝水，因此而得名。



現在艾倫島上仍然隨處可見野鹿。

[Arran whisky slash thinking 1] The prince's wine is made from the cleanest water in Scotland.
01 Nov 2019, 11:10 by Lin Yijun, He Zongsheng
The Scots described Allen Island as a small island with less than 5,000 residents. It was cut into highlands and lowlands by highland boundary faults. The island has hills, streams, valleys and coasts. It is simply the epitome of Scotland.
The Queen of England took care of this small island, not only went to the island to unveil the winery, but also helped William and Harry to drink. We came to the island thousands of miles just to find out the unique slash thinking of the island whisky Arran.



I flew all the way to Glasgow, the largest export port of Scotch whisky, and drove all the way south. One hour later, I arrived at the Ardrossan ferry and drove the ferry to the ferry. It didn't take long before I arrived. Isle of Arran in the middle of the islands of Scotland and Campbell.
There is only one winery on the island named after the island. If the time and space go back to the 18th century, the government of Scotland and England will start to impose a whisky tax. Before that, there were more than 50 illegal distillations on Allen Island at different times. plant.
In the 1820s, the British government amended the tax law to allow wineries to apply for legal business. In 1825, Lagg Distillery, which opened on the south side of the island, was the only winery that had a license. Unfortunately, it was unable to withstand the operational difficulties. In 1837, it was announced to shut down the factory.


Arran founder Harold Currie (middle seater) and his family photo, but the winery has now changed hands.



Arran's staff took a group photo at the brewery in 1996.



On April 5, 1995, the new distiller was moved into the factory.

155 years after Lagg shut down the factory, Harold Currie, former managing director of Chivas, and two partners launched a plan to re-establish the winery on Allen Island in 1992. In 1994, they chose the northwestern tip of the island. Lochranza was built. At 2:29 pm on June 29, 1995, the distiller of the Arran winery began to operate.
Although it is a brand new winery, it has been highly anticipated by all walks of life. The British royal family is of course the best blessing. In the 1997 tour of the west coast of Scotland, Queen Elizabeth II sneaked into Arran Island to unveil the winery. The winery also sent two barrels of whisky. The Queen waved a big hand and said that the two barrels of wine are better for two grandchildren! So the two barrels of wine were written with the name of Prince William and Prince Harry, and now they are still asleep in the winery, waiting for the best day to come.

When Queen Elizabeth II visited the west coast of Scotland in 1997, she went to Arran to host the official opening ceremony.



Arran gave William and Prince Harry's whisky in 1997 and is still sleeping in oak barrels.



Zhu Hewei (second from left), the founder of Nikka Winery in Japan, also made a special trip to visit the winery.

The son of the Japanese whisky founder, Zhu Hezheng Xiao, and the founder of the Nikka winery, Zhu Hewei, also made a special trip to visit, and there are many whisky industry authorities. And she did not live up to expectations. In 2007, she won the honor of the best winery in Scotland. Each of the works won the international competition award every year, which made us curious about Allen Island and this winery.


Arran's whisky has been recognized by many international competitions.

Early this morning, Arran Asia Pacific Commercial Director Rob Gray drove us around half of the island to Rohranza, and opened arms to meet us is the chief bartender of the Arran Winery, James Mac Taggart, who joined Allen in 2007. It is a well-known figure in the whisky industry. I live on the island of Islay. I commute to Allen Island every week to work, and only go home on weekends. The old gentleman who seems to be awkward, when he was young, was a music player who had long hair, a group orchestra, and a keyboard player. Now he occasionally plays a few songs during the music festival.
As soon as I met, James took us to the creek next to the winery. ""Our water is flowing from Loch Na Davie Lake. It was the drinking place of the deer many years ago. If you want to make a non-peat flavor. Whisky, you will need very clean water, which is one of the best water sources in Scotland,"" he said confidently.


The appearance of the Arran Distillation Plant is very simple, with only the top PAGODA leaking winery identity.



The water in this creek is from Loch Na Davie. For many years, the wild deer loved to drink water in this lake, hence the name.



Wild deer are still everywhere on Allen Island.
