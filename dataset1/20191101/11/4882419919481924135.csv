Spain will announce their squad next Friday for games against Malta and Romania, with the U21s naming their squad on the same day for matches against North Macedonia and Israel. It's the final international break of the year and the last until March.
Ansu Fati is set to be included in the U21 squad once again. He made his debut on Oct. 15 against Montenegro, coming on as a substitute aged 16 years, 11 months and 14 days -- he turned 17 on Thursday.
The RFEF plan to keep him with the U21s, even though he's not played much in the last month, before returning to the starting lineup for Tuesday's 5-1 win over Real Valladolid at Camp Nou.
Spain are aware of the talent he has and want to manage his progression carefully given the effort they made in getting his citizenship through in order to be able to call him up.
