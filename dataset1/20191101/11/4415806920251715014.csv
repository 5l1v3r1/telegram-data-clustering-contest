Irish band The Script have announced that they will come to Cork next year as part of their European tour to promote their Sunsets and Full Moons album.
The trio are playing at Musgrave Park on June 23 with tickets going on sale next Friday (November 8).
“I think it’s the most poignant record we’ve ever made,” said lead singer Danny O’Donoghue.
“Our music was always about being together with the audience, and writing about your own feelings, and sharing them.”
Guitarist Mark Sheehan added that the album is the band doing what they do best.
“No frills, no production, just us playing as a band,” he said.
Before playing in Cork in the summer, The Script play in Belfast in March before three shows at Dublin's 3Arena on March 5, 6, and 7.
English singer-songwriter Becky Hill will be the special guest at Musgrave Park.
