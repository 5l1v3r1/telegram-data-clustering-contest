設立教育儲蓄基金，為子女未來到海外升學未雨綢繆？《經濟一週》的專欄作家李振豪於2018年曾如此道：現在愈來愈多的家長考慮讓子女赴海外升學，因為海外國家有完善的教育制度，而且能鍛鍊子女的獨立能力，也能接觸多元的文化，為未來創造更大發展的空間和機會。不過要達成讓子女到海外升學的目標，充裕的財政能力是不可或缺。

子女海外升學
現在很多孩子都是在父母的庇護下成長，出國升學後便必須學會自己打理自己的生活，學會怎樣與人相處，學會一個人面對困難，這一切都有利於培養孩子的獨立能力以及責任感，做好以後承擔責任的準備。
而且，海外教育非常注重實踐和動手能力的培養，學生可以接觸到很多課本之外的東西，開闊視野，為未來升學和工作爭取更多的經驗。
同時海外寄宿有着多姿多彩的生活，參加社交活動和派對，更讓你有機會認識不同國家的人，提升文化素養。再者，要學好一門語言，其語言的環境非常重要。在國外讀書及生活，可令子女在良好的語言環境下成長，而且學校預備了各種綜合性的語言課程，對語言的提升和交流都非常有幫助。

設立教育儲蓄基金
說了一堆海外升學的好處，但最終要達成讓子女到海外升學的目標，充裕的財政能力是不可或缺。事實上，近年海外留學的學費不斷上升，以最熱門的升學國家如英國、美國為例，每年的學費及生活開支動輒要10萬至20萬港元，父母要讓子女成材，必須有長遠的財務安排配合，例如設立教育基金。
財政未雨綢繆
現在市場上有多種的教育儲蓄計劃，有不同的供款年期、累積年期及附加保障，投保人可選擇適合自己的計劃，未雨綢繆，為子女的教育作完善的安排！
以投保儲蓄計劃為例，供款十年而累積期為十年，總繳保費為96萬元，每年以5厘回報複息增加，再加上終期紅利計算，總預期儲蓄保障為240萬元（等如已繳保費總額的2.5倍）。再以十年教育基金儲蓄計劃為例，每月5,000元計，平均增長4.5%，投保人子女在四年大學期間，每年便可有18萬元作讀書及其他如住宿、伙食、交通等開支。
目前市面上的教育基金，除了儲蓄的部分，其實也包括很多自選附加保障，如額外人壽保障及保證保費不變，保額有些最高可達基本計劃保證儲蓄金額的五倍。

提供穩妥財務安排
再者，保單亦有延續保障，一旦受保人身故，保單仍會持續累積供款，累積期完結時會向受益人派發，這樣保證儲蓄的金額，能達至原先儲蓄的目標。而且，受保人身故時有兩種不同的賠償方案給受益人，即以一筆過形式或分期二至十年領取。
如父母擔心子女將一筆過的儲蓄保障胡亂花費，可選擇於累積期完結後的二至十年內，定期派發儲蓄保障予留學海外的子女。分期領取能定期按受益人的需要發放，切合其未來需要，為子女教育提供穩妥的財務安排。
如不幸的事發生，父母於供款期内不幸身故，保單的延續保障亦確保保單繼續生效及延續供款，保證子女將來定時收取儲蓄保障作海外生活費用，令財務安排變得有效及更有規律！

Children's overseas study
Nowadays, many children are growing up under the protection of their parents. After going abroad to study, they must learn to take care of their own lives, learn how to get along with others, and learn to face difficulties. This is all about fostering children's independence and responsibility. Be prepared to take responsibility in the future.
Moreover, overseas education is very focused on the cultivation of practical and practical skills. Students can get in touch with a lot of textbooks, broaden their horizons, and gain more experience for future studies and work.
At the same time, overseas boarding has a colorful life, participation in social activities and parties, and gives you the opportunity to meet people from different countries and enhance cultural literacy. Furthermore, to learn a language, the language environment is very important. Studying and living abroad can help children grow up in a good language environment, and the school has prepared a variety of comprehensive language courses, which are very helpful for language promotion and communication.


Overseas education places great emphasis on the cultivation of practical and hands-on skills. Students can reach out to many textbooks and broaden their horizons.

Education Savings Fund
Speaking of the benefits of overseas study, but ultimately to achieve the goal of letting children go abroad for study, ample financial ability is indispensable. In fact, the tuition fees for studying abroad have been rising in recent years. In the most popular countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, the annual tuition and living expenses are between 100,000 and 200,000 Hong Kong dollars. Parents must have long-term financial resources to make their children. Arrange for cooperation, such as setting up an education fund.
Financial planning
There are a variety of education savings plans on the market, with different contributions, accumulated years and additional guarantees. The insured can choose the plan that suits them, plan ahead and make perfect arrangements for their children's education!
Take the insured savings plan as an example. The contribution period is ten years and the cumulative period is ten years. The total premium paid is 960,000 yuan. The annual interest rate increase is 5%, plus the final dividend calculation. The total expected savings guarantee is 2.4 million yuan. (Equivalent to 2.5 times the total premium paid). Taking the 10-year education fund savings plan as an example, the monthly increase of 4.5% per month is 5,000 yuan. The children of the insured can spend 180,000 yuan a year on reading and other expenses such as accommodation, food, transportation, etc. during the four-year university period. .
At present, the education funds on the market, in addition to the savings, actually include a lot of optional additional protection, such as additional life insurance and guaranteed premiums, some of which can be up to five times the amount guaranteed by the basic plan.


At present, the education fund on the market, in addition to the savings, actually includes a lot of optional additional protection.

Provide sound financial arrangements
In addition, the policy also has a continuation guarantee. Once the insured person dies, the policy will continue to accumulate contributions. The end of the accumulation period will be distributed to the beneficiaries, so as to ensure that the amount of savings can reach the original savings target. Moreover, when the insured person dies, there are two different compensation schemes for the beneficiary, that is, one-off or two- to ten-year collection.
If parents are worried that their children will spend a piece of savings protection indiscriminately, they can choose to distribute savings protection to their children overseas when they are within two to ten years after the end of the accumulation period. The periodical collection can be issued on a regular basis to the beneficiary's needs, in line with its future needs, and provide a sound financial arrangement for the education of the children.
In the event of unfortunate incidents, parents are unfortunately dead in the contributory period. The continuation of the policy also ensures that the policy will continue to be in force and continue to be repaid, ensuring that the child will receive savings protection for overseas living expenses in the future, so that the financial arrangements become effective and more Regular!
