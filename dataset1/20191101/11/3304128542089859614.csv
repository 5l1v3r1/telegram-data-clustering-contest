Jubilee Candidate for Kibra by-election, McDonald Mariga, was on Wednesday hosted by the Deputy President William Ruto’s wife Rachael at the duo’s National Prayer Altar in Karen, Nairobi.
In photos shared by Mama Rachael on her official Twitter handle, Mariga can be seen kneeling down as the DP’s wife and unidentified preacher prayed for him.
“Mcdonald Mariga visited us this Wednesday at the National Prayer Altar during our weekly Prayer and fasting fellowship. We joined together in prayer as we all wished him the best as he runs for the seat of member of parliament for Kibra constituency, she wrote.
She invoked favour upon him as he hopes to clinch the MP seat.
“He’ll answer him from His holy heaven With the saving strength of His right hand. Some trust in chariots & some in horses but we’ll remember the name of the Lord our God. They have bowed down & fallen but we’ve risen & stand upright. Save Lord, May the King answer us when we call, ” she added.

Other candidates in the race are Amani National Congress’ Eliud Owala, ord Kenya’s Eng. Khamisi Butichi and several independent candidates eyeing the seat.
