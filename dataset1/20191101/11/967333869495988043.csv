New Delhi (Sputnik): Pakistani cricketers often find themselves in the middle of controversies, including pacer Shahid Afridi, Mohammad Akram and most recently Imam-ul-Haq. The star cricketer had to issue an apology after landing in hot water over leaked sexist messages he'd written to women on WhatsApp.

Hareem Shah, who has made a name for herself by making videos featuring famous personalities on Tik Tok, has now claimed to have recorded a video of a “famous Pakistani cricketer” allegedly exposing himself to her while he masturbated.
Shah took to her Twitter handle to reveal it while claiming to have recorded the video of the cricketer with his face visible in it.
The Tik tok star seems to be threatening the alleged cricketer with a different kind of negative exposure: on social media. She has withheld the player’s name. 



Her tweet has led to a flurry of reactions with social media users criticising her for stooping to such a level for “cheap publicity” and defaming people.












A Pakistani girl recently took out revenge on Pakistan’s star cricketer Imam-ul-Haq by making their private chats public domain. She accused him of cheating and exploitation.
