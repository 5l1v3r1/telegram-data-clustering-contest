王友群：江澤民取締法輪功的決策是荒謬的

01 Nov 2019, 11:05

今年是中共迫害法輪功20年。這場禍及全球的迫害，從海外來說，已徹底失敗；從中國大陸來說，離開高壓與欺騙，一天也維持不下去了。
追根溯源，當時的中共獨裁者江澤民，1999年「4.25」事件當晚發誓「戰勝法輪功」的基點，就是錯的。從此，一步錯，步步錯，一直錯到今天，變成罪上加罪，血債累累。

江澤民致中共政治局常委的信

1999年4月25日，發生了上萬名法輪功學員到北京中南海和平上訪事件。直接原因是，天津發生了防暴警察毆打、非法抓捕40多名法輪功學員的惡性事件。
深層原因是：中共內部極少數別有用心的人企圖剷除法輪功，突出表現在：（1）1996年7月24日，法輪功學員每天必讀的經典《轉法輪》等，被新聞出版署列為禁書，禁止公開出版發行；
（2）「中國科學院院士」何祚庥等，違反中央對氣功「不宣傳、不批評、不爭論」的政策，在電視、報紙、雜誌上，發表極端不負責任的胡亂批判法輪功的言論；
（3）1998年7月21日，公安部發出《關於對法輪功開展調查的通知》，要求各地公安機關祕密調查法輪功的「違法犯罪」問題。之後，黑龍江、新疆、河北、山東、福建、江蘇省鹽城市、遼寧省朝陽區、遼陽市、凌源市的某些基層公安機關，有的宣布法輪功學員煉功是「非法集會」，強行驅散；有的非法查抄法輪功學員的私有財產；有的對煉功群眾進行非法拘禁、關押、打罵、罰款等。
（4）個別地方下令取締法輪功。遼寧省朝陽市公安局，仿效公安部的《通知》，以「法輪功是公安部明令禁止的非法氣功」為名，向所屬公安部門發出朝公發（1998）37號文件《關於禁止法輪功非法活動的通知》，下令對法輪功「立即予以取締」。
（5）全國各地法輪功學員，本著關心誠意，接連不斷給江澤民等，寫了大量信件，反映法輪功問題，比如，1998年8月底，中紀委副局級官員葛秀蘭等135名法輪功學員，曾聯名致信江澤民。但是，所有這些信，全都沒有回音。
「4.25」到中南海上訪的法輪功學員，雖然人數達1萬多，但從始至終，秩序良好，沒有標語，沒有口號，沒有傳單，沒有演講，沒有大聲喧譁，也沒有影響正常的交通。撤離時，連警察丟在地上菸頭等，都被法輪功學員揀走了，地上沒有留下一片紙屑！僅從外在觀感看，這是1949年中共建政以來發生的最和平理性的一次請願活動。
但是，踏著「六四」學生鮮血登上中共權力最高位的江澤民，突然看到這麼多人聚集在中南海外，他第一念想到的，不是搞清事實真相，而是他的權力可能受到威脅。本來，當天，時任中共政治局常委、國務院總理朱鎔基，請3名法輪功學員到中南海內了解情況，然後作出了立即釋放天津被抓捕的法輪功學員的決定，得知這些情況後，上萬名法輪功學員立即靜悄悄地散去。事件得到初步解決。但是，這一事件令江澤民異常震驚、不安。
當晚，江澤民寫了一封致中共政治局常委的信，其中，最關鍵的一句是：「難道我們共產黨人所具有的馬克思主義理論，所信奉的唯物論、無神論，還戰勝不了『法輪功』所宣揚的那一套東西嗎?」
這句話透露了兩大信息：第一，這是中共黨魁第一次就法輪功問題表態，且對法輪功是持全盤否定態度的；第二，江澤民發誓「戰勝」法輪功。

江澤民的信由中央辦公廳下發傳達

從正常人的思維來說，對「4.25」事件作出正確判斷，必須做到：第一，了解法輪功是什麼？第二，法輪功在全中國和全世界的傳播情況；第三，法輪功學員為什麼上訪？他們的訴求是什麼？第四，香港、台灣是怎麼對待法輪功的？第五，美、英、法等外國是怎麼對待法輪功的？第六，綜合各方面情況後，作出是非、善惡、正邪的判斷。
但是，江澤民沒有這樣做。
「4.25」事件發生前，長達7年的時間裡，作為中共黨魁，江澤民擁有一切便利條件，及時了解，並妥善處理法輪功問題。但是，在如此長的時間內，江澤民從未就法輪功問題作過全面、深入、細緻的調查研究。
然而，就是「4.25」事件發生的當晚，江澤民就匆匆忙忙、慌慌張張作出了「否定法輪功」的判斷，並作出了「戰勝法輪功」的決斷。
江澤民的信，只是他個人當天對上萬名法輪功學員到中南海上訪的看法，沒有經過中央政治局常委會討論通過，沒有經過中央政治局討論通過，更沒有經過中央委員會討論通過。
據了解，江澤民對法輪功問題的表態，當時的7位中共政治局常委中，李鵬、朱鎔基、李瑞環、胡錦濤、尉健行、李嵐清6人都反對。

怎麼辦？

江澤民想了一個辦法，責成時任中央辦公廳主任王剛，將他的信直接下發傳達。1999年4月27日，中央辦公廳發出【1999】中辦發第14號文件「關於印發『江澤民給政治局常委及其他有關領導的信』的通知」。
當時，江澤民的信傳達的範圍很廣。在中紀委監察部機關，不僅向省（部）級及以上官員傳達了，而且向局級官員、處級官員也傳達了。
我當時聽傳達時，有關領導根本沒有要求對外嚴格保密。處級官員都知道了，基本上全黨都知道了。江澤民這麼做，等於通過一個特殊的轉換方式，將他個人對法輪功的錯誤看法，以中央辦公廳文件的形式，強加給全黨了。

對法輪功的所謂調查

1999年6月7日，江澤民在中共政治局會議上作了「關於抓緊處理和解決『法輪功』問題的講話」。江提議成立中央解決法輪功問題領導小組，由任中共政治局常委、國務院副總理李嵐清任組長，時任中共政治局委員、中宣部長丁關銀，時任中共政治局委員、中央政法委書記羅干任副組長；著手在全國範圍內對法輪功問題展開調查。這個領導小組下設一個辦公室，因成立於1999年6月10日，被稱為中央610辦公室。對法輪功的調查，就是由中央610辦公室組織實施的。
因為事先已經有了江澤民「戰勝法輪功」的結論；610辦公室的調查變得非常簡單：按照江澤民的結論，去找證明這個結論正確的「證據」。凡是說法輪功好的，儘管是大量的，普遍的，一概視而不見，充耳不聞；凡是說法輪功不好，儘管全是假的，一概如獲至寶。
經過短短ㄧ個多月，中央610辦公室便完成了對中國31個省、自治區、直轄市的上億法輪功學員的調查，收集來的「證據」證明：江澤民的結論「完全正確」。
1999年7月20日，江澤民動用全部國家機器，以天塌地陷之勢，發動了對法輪功的瘋狂大迫害。

法輪功的真相

法輪功，又稱法輪大法，1992年5月13日，由法輪功創始人李洪志先生從中國東北的長春市傳出。因袪病健身、淨化身心有奇效，迅速傳遍全中國，傳到全世界。
法輪功要求修煉者按照「真、善、忍」做好人，不斷提升自己的道德水準；有五套簡單易學的功法。
1998年5月11日，原來由公安部等9部委共管的氣功，改為由國家體育總局統一管理。
1998年5月15日，時任國家體育總局局長伍紹祖，在長春專門視察法輪功學員在廣場上集體煉功的盛大場面。當晚10點，中央電視台第套一節目和第五套節目報道了這一新聞。
1998年10月，國家體育總局派氣功註冊評審調研組到長春調研，歷時一週，除深入煉功點明察暗訪外，還召開了52名法輪功學員參加的座談會，其中，包括企業家、居委會主任、工人、政府官員、老紅軍、現職軍級幹部，大專院校的教授就有25人。
座談會上，調研組組長邱玉才說：「關於法輪功問題，國家體總委託我和管謙、李志超，到長春對法輪功做一個了解。」「通過調查了解，長春有十幾萬人在煉法輪功，而且層次較高，有十幾所大專院校的教授、博士生導師、高級幹部，還有從工人到知識分子各個層面上的都有，確實功效很顯著。這一方面沒有疑議。」「我們認為法輪功的功法功效都不錯，對於社會的穩定，對於精神文明建設，效果是很顯著的，這個要充分肯定。」
1998年11月24日，上海電視台報導：「到目前為止，包括港、澳、台在內的全國各地都有自發性的群眾煉功組織，並傳遍歐、美、澳、亞四大洲，全世界約有一億人在學法輪大法。」
隨著學煉法輪功的人越來越多，法輪功曾主動要求中共進行監督、管理。
1996年4月，法輪功學員向全國人大民族事務委員會寫報告，申請掛靠在該委員會下，成立一個非宗教的法輪功群眾學術團體，未獲批准。之後，向中央統戰部寫報告，申請掛靠統戰部下，成立一個非宗教的法輪功學術團體，未獲同意。
而在中國大陸以外的國家和地區，如美國、印度、以色列、法國、香港、台灣等，都登記成立了合法的法輪大法學會。

江澤民害人害己

1999年5月7日，我在致江澤民的信《法輪大法於國於民有百利而無一害》中寫道：「可以預言，將來不論有多大的阻力和障礙，還會有更多的人加入法輪大法修煉者的行列之中。」20年後的今天，我的預言成真。
到目前為止，法輪功已洪傳到全世界100多個國家和地區，法輪功的經典著作《轉法輪》已被翻譯成43種外文在中國大陸以外公開出版發行，成為中華五千年文明史上被翻譯成外文最多的中文經典。法輪功創始人李洪志先生，受到超越國界、黨派、種族、語言、性別、年齡、職業、文化背景、宗教信仰的各階層人士發自內心的敬仰和推崇。
江澤民因為迫害法輪功犯下滔天大罪，成為全世界最臭名昭著的人渣敗類。從2000年起，法輪功學員在30多個國家和地區將江澤民告上法庭。從2015年5月起，全世界已有21萬法輪功學員實名向北京最高法院、最高檢察院控告江澤民。這是人類歷史上空前未有的偉大壯舉。
從1999年5月7日我給江澤民寫信講清法輪功真相，到今天，全世界法輪功學員講真相講了整整20年。
2019年10月25日，我在大紀元發表《審判江澤民 邁向新紀元》。其中，我寫道：「當今中國的執政者，誰能拿下『賊王』江澤民，誰就一定能得到神助，獲得天賦神授的真正權柄。」
「香港將恢復往日的寧靜，台海將重歸波平浪靜，中國將重新回到神的懷抱，與神庇佑下的美國及整個世界，共享尊榮與太平。」
跟江澤民算總帳的時間一天一天臨近了。
愛因斯坦是20世紀最偉大的科學家，晚年轉入神學研究。愛因斯坦晚年講過一句意味深長的話：「一切都是被安排好的」。
中共最有權勢的人物毛澤東死後不到一個月，他的老婆、在十年「文革」中害人無數、紅得發紫的江青，被抓捕。1976年10月6日，是江青遭惡報的日子。
江澤民遭惡報的日子，我相信，神早就安排好了！

Wang Youqun: Jiang Zemin’s decision to ban Falun Gong is ridiculous

01 Nov 2019, 11:05

This year is the CCP’s 20 years of persecution of Falun Gong. This persecution and global persecution has completely failed from overseas. From the perspective of mainland China, leaving high pressure and deception will not last for a day.
Tracing back to the source, the then CCP dictator Jiang Zemin, the base of the ""4.25"" incident in 1999, swearing ""to defeat Falun Gong"" was wrong. From then on, one step wrong, step by step wrong, has been wrong until today, turned into sin plus sin, blood debt.

Letter from Jiang Zemin to the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party

On April 25, 1999, tens of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners went to Beijing Zhongnanhai for a peaceful petition. The direct cause is that a violent incident in which riot police beaten and illegally arrested more than 40 Falun Gong practitioners occurred in Tianjin.
The underlying reason is that a small number of people with ulterior motives in the CCP attempt to eradicate Falun Gong. The outstanding performances are as follows: (1) On July 24, 1996, the classic Zhuan Falun, which must be read by Falun Gong practitioners every day, was banned by the Press and Publication Administration. Public publishing is prohibited;
(2) He Wei, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, violated the central government's policy of ""no propaganda, no criticism, no argument"" on Qigong, and published extremely irresponsible and criticized Falun Gong remarks on television, newspapers and magazines;
(3) On July 21, 1998, the Ministry of Public Security issued the ""Notice on Conducting Investigations on Falun Gong"", requiring local public security organs to secretly investigate Falun Gong's ""illegal crimes"". Later, some grassroots public security organs in Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, Hebei, Shandong, Fujian, Jiangsu Province, Yangzhou City, Chaoyang District, Liaoyang City, and Lingyuan City announced that Falun Gong practitioners practiced as ""illegal gatherings"" and forced to disperse. Some illegally seized the private property of Falun Gong practitioners; some illegally detained, imprisoned, beaten, fined, etc.
(4) Individual places ordered the ban on Falun Gong. The Public Security Bureau of Chaoyang City, Liaoning Province, imitating the ""Notice"" of the Ministry of Public Security, in the name of ""Falun Gong is an illegal qigong prohibited by the Ministry of Public Security"", issued a document to the public security department (No. 37, No. 37) on the illegal activities against Falun Gong. The Notice, ordered the ""immediate ban"" of Falun Gong.
(5) Falun Gong practitioners from all over the country, in the interest of sincerity, successively wrote to Jiang Zemin and other letters, reflecting Falun Gong issues. For example, at the end of August 1998, 135 Falun Gong practitioners such as Ge Xiulan, deputy bureaucrat of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, once worked. The joint name sent to Jiang Zemin. However, all these letters have no response.
The ""4.25"" Falun Gong practitioners who visited China and South China Sea had more than 10,000 people, but from the beginning to the end, they were in good order, no slogans, no slogans, no flyers, no speeches, no loud noises, and no normal traffic. When the evacuation, even the police threw the cigarette butts on the ground, and they were all picked up by Falun Gong practitioners. There was no piece of paper on the ground! From the perspective of external perception, this is the most peaceful and rational petition that has taken place since the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party in 1949.
However, Jiang Zemin, who took the blood of the ""June 4th"" students to the top of the CCP's power, suddenly saw so many people gathered in Central and South China. His first thought was not to clarify the truth, but his power may be affected. Threat. Originally, on the same day, Zhu Rongji, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party and Premier of the State Council, asked three Falun Gong practitioners to get to know the situation in Zhongnanhai, and then made a decision to immediately release the Falun Gong practitioners who were arrested in Tianjin. After learning about these situations, tens of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners. The students immediately dispersed quietly. The incident was initially resolved. However, this incident made Jiang Zemin extremely shocked and upset.
On the evening, Jiang Zemin wrote a letter to the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party. The most crucial one is: ""Does the Marxist theory of our Communists, the materialism and atheism that they believe in, cannot defeat the ""Falungong""? What kind of thing is it about?""
This sentence reveals two major messages: First, this is the first time the Communist Party leader has expressed his position on Falun Gong and has a total negative attitude toward Falun Gong. Second, Jiang Zemin vowed to ""compete"" Falun Gong.

Jiang Zemin’s letter was sent by the Central Office

From the perspective of normal people, to make a correct judgment on the ""4.25"" incident, we must do the following: First, what is Falun Gong? Second, the spread of Falun Gong in China and the whole world. Third, why did Falun Gong practitioners petition? What are their demands? Fourth, how do Hong Kong and Taiwan treat Falun Gong? Fifth, how do foreign countries such as the United States, Britain, and France treat Falun Gong? Sixth, after summing up all aspects of the situation, make judgments on right and wrong, good and evil, and righteousness.
However, Jiang Zemin did not do this.
Before the ""4.25"" incident, as a leader of the Chinese Communist Party for seven years, Jiang Zemin had all the convenient conditions to understand and properly handle Falun Gong. However, in such a long period of time, Jiang Zemin has never conducted a comprehensive, in-depth and meticulous investigation and study on Falun Gong.
However, on the night of the ""4.25"" incident, Jiang Zemin made a ""negative Falun Gong"" judgment in a hurry and panic, and made a decision to ""compete Falun Gong.""
Jiang Zemin’s letter is only his personal opinion on the 10,000 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners’ visit to Central and South China Sea. It was not discussed and approved by the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee. It was not discussed and approved by the Central Political Bureau, and it was not discussed and passed by the Central Committee.
It is understood that Jiang Zemin’s position on the Falun Gong issue was opposed by the six members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing.

How to do?

Jiang Zemin thought of a way to instruct Wang Gang, the then director of the Central Office, to send his letter directly. On April 27, 1999, the Central Office issued the ""No. 14 Document"" issued in [1999] on the issuance of the ""Letter from Jiang Zemin to the Politburo Standing Committee and other relevant leaders"".
At that time, Jiang Zemin’s letter was widely distributed. In the supervision department of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, it was not only communicated to officials at the provincial (ministerial) level and above, but also to bureau-level officials and department-level officials.
When I heard the communication, the leaders did not ask for strict confidentiality. Officials at the department level know that basically the whole party knows. Jiang Zemin’s doing this is equivalent to imposing his personal misconceptions about Falun Gong on the entire party in the form of documents from the Central Office through a special conversion method.

The so-called investigation of Falun Gong

On June 7, 1999, Jiang Zemin made a speech on the issue of handling and solving the ""Falungong"" issue at the Political Bureau meeting of the Chinese Communist Party. Jiang proposed to set up a central leadership group to resolve Falun Gong. He was appointed as the leader of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party and Vice Premier Li Lanqing. He was then a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China and Minister of the Central Propaganda Ding Guanyin. He was then a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC and the deputy head of the Central Political and Legal Committee. ; started to investigate Falun Gong issues nationwide. This leading group has an office, which was established on June 10, 1999 and is known as the Central 610 Office. The investigation of Falun Gong was organized and implemented by the Central 610 Office.
Because Jiang Zemin’s conclusion of ""Fighting Falun Gong"" has already been made in advance; the investigation of the 610 office has become very simple: according to Jiang Zemin's conclusion, I have to find the ""evidence"" to prove this conclusion. Anything that says that the round of good work is good, even though it is a large number, universal, and turned a blind eye to it; it is not good to say that all the rounds of work are not good, even though they are all false, they are all treasured.
After just over a month, the Central 610 Office completed an investigation of hundreds of millions of Falun Gong practitioners in 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government. The evidence collected by Jiang Zemin proved that Jiang Zemin’s conclusion was ""completely correct.""
On July 20, 1999, Jiang Zemin used all state machines to launch a violent persecution of Falun Gong.

The truth about Falun Gong

Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, was born on May 13, 1992 by Mr. Li Hongzhi, the founder of Falun Gong, from Changchun City in northeastern China. Because of illness, fitness, and purification of mind and body, it has spread rapidly throughout China and spread to the whole world.
Falun Gong requires practitioners to improve their moral standards in accordance with ""truthfulness, benevolence and tolerance""; there are five sets of simple and easy to learn exercises.
On May 11, 1998, Qigong, which was originally managed by the Ministry of Public Security and other nine ministries, was replaced by the State Sports General Administration.
On May 15, 1998, Wu Shaozu, then director of the State Sports General Administration, in Changchun specially inspected the grand scene of Falun Gong practitioners practicing collectively in the square. At 10 o'clock that night, CCTV reported the news on the first set of programs and the fifth set.
In October 1998, the State General Administration of Sports sent a qigong registration review and investigation team to Changchun for a week. In addition to in-depth visits to the practice sites, 52 symposiums attended by Falun Gong practitioners were held, including entrepreneurs and directors of neighborhood committees. There are 25 professors, government officials, old Red Army, current military-level cadres, and professors in universities and colleges.
At the symposium, Qiu Yucai, head of the research team, said: ""On the Falun Gong issue, the State Body commissioned me and Guan Qian and Li Zhichao to go to Changchun to learn about Falun Gong."" ""According to the investigation, there are more than 100,000 people in Changchun who are practicing Falun Gong. At the higher level, there are more than a dozen college and university professors, doctoral tutors, senior cadres, and all levels of workers and intellectuals. The effectiveness is very significant. There is no doubt in this regard."" We believe that the effectiveness of Falun Gong's exercises is good. For the stability of society and for the construction of spiritual civilization, the effect is very significant. This must be fully affirmed.""
On November 24, 1998, Shanghai TV reported: ""So far, there have been spontaneous mass practice organizations throughout the country, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and spread to Europe, the United States, Australia and Asia. About 100 million people around the world are studying Falun Dafa.""
With the increasing number of people practicing Falun Gong, Falun Gong has taken the initiative to ask the CCP to supervise and manage.
In April 1996, Falun Gong practitioners wrote a report to the National People's Congress National Affairs Commission, and applied for a non-religious Falun Gong mass academic group under the committee, which was not approved. Afterwards, he wrote a report to the Central United Front Work Department and applied for a joint non-religious Falun Gong academic group under the united front of the United Front. He did not agree.
In countries and regions outside mainland China, such as the United States, India, Israel, France, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, the legal Falun Dafa Association has been registered.

Jiang Zemin harms others

On May 7, 1999, I wrote in a letter to Jiang Zemin that ""Falun Dafa is in the country and has no harm in the people."" It can be predicted that there will be more no matter how much resistance and obstacles there will be in the future. People join the ranks of Falun Dafa practitioners."" Today, 20 years later, my predictions come true.
So far, Falun Gong has spread to more than 100 countries and regions around the world. Falun Gong's classic book Zhuan Falun has been translated into 43 foreign languages for publication and publication outside mainland China, and has been translated into the history of China's five thousand years of civilization. The most Chinese classic in foreign languages. Mr. Li Hongzhi, the founder of Falun Gong, has been admired and respected by people of all walks of life who transcend national borders, parties, races, languages, genders, ages, occupations, cultural backgrounds and religious beliefs.
Jiang Zemin became the most notorious scum of the world because he persecuted Falun Gong and committed a great crime. Since 2000, Falun Gong practitioners have taken Jiang Zemin to court in more than 30 countries and regions. Since May 2015, 210,000 Falun Gong practitioners around the world have filed their names with Jiang Zemin at the Beijing Supreme Court and the Supreme Procuratorate. This is a great feat that has never been seen before in human history.
From May 7, 1999, I wrote a letter to Jiang Zemin about the truth about Falun Gong. Today, Falun Gong practitioners all over the world have been telling the truth for 20 years.
On October 25, 2019, I published ""Judge Jiang Zemin's New Era"" in the Epoch Times. Among them, I wrote: ""Where the Chinese governor, who can win the ""thief king"" Jiang Zemin, whoever can get the help of God, gain the true authority of the gods.""
""Hong Kong will restore its former tranquility. The Taiwan Strait will return to the calm and calm. China will return to the embrace of God and share the honor and peace with the United States and the whole world under the blessing of God.""
The time to calculate the general ledger with Jiang Zemin is approaching day by day.
Einstein was the greatest scientist of the 20th century and transferred to theological studies in his later years. Einstein spoke a long time in his old words: ""Everything is arranged.""
Less than a month after the death of Mao Zedong, the most powerful figure of the CCP, his wife, Jiang Qing, who was in the midst of a decade of ""Cultural Revolution"" and was red and purple, was arrested. On October 6, 1976, it was the day when Jiang Qing was badly reported.
When Jiang Zemin was badly reported, I believe that God has already arranged it!
