HALIFAX -- Strong winds pulled down power lines across the Maritimes on Friday.
NB Power, the Crown-owed electric utility in New Brunswick, said more than 48,000 homes and businesses were without power by the early afternoon.
About 15,000 were without electricity in Nova Scotia, as were about 800 in P.E.I. earlier in the day.
Environment Canada issued wind warnings and special weather statements for much of the three provinces and parts of Newfoundland and Labrador.
The forecast called for winds gusting between 90 and 110 kilometres per hour in southern New Brunswick, western and northern Nova Scotia, all of Prince Edward Island and parts of Newfoundland and Labrador.
The night before, Northumberland Ferries Ltd. cancelled all Friday crossings for the ferry that links Wood Islands, P.E.I., with Caribou, N.S.
As for the Confederation Bridge, where the winds were gusting at almost 90 kilometres an hour in the morning, traffic restrictions were imposed on automobiles pulling trailers, motorcycles and high-sided vehicles.
