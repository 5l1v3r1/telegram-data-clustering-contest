Nigel Farage today begged Boris Johnson for a massive ""leave alliance"" which could see Tory and Brexit Party candidates stand down to back each other at the general election .
The seven-time failed Westminster candidate declared he was ""more than willing to compromise"" - if the Tory dumps his ""dreadful"" Brexit deal and pivots to no-deal instead.
That, he claimed, could involve up to 150 Tory candidates stepping aside in seats where they have little hope - in exchange for the Brexit Party not contesting any other Tory seats.
If not, Mr Farage claimed, ""we will contest every single seat in England Scotland and Wales"".
He threatened: ""Please don’t doubt we are ready... Next Monday we have 500 candidates coming to London and they will all be signing their candidate forms on that day.""
Yet a deal looks unlikely after a senior member of Johnson's team told journalists Farage was not a ""fit and proper person"" and ""should never be allowed anywhere near government.""

And Mr Farage stumbled when asked for the details of what a leave alliance would actually mean in practice - and whether candidates would truly pull out.
Asked if it could mean asking Tory candidates to stand aside in 150 seats, Mr Farage said he'd offered the ""upper end"" but it was a negotiation.

He said: ""It could be a non aggression pact. There are lots of different ways this could be done.""
The comments came at a press conference to launch the Brexit Party campaign today.
