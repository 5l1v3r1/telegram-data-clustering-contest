Chippa are finalising their preparations to host Sundowns in their Telkom Knockout quarter-final match at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Sunday, and word coming out of the Eastern Cape outfit’s camp is that Mashaba is struggling with an injury.
Mashaba was instrumental in helping the Chilli Boys overcome Bloemfontein Celtic in the previous round of the competition.

The 30-year-old versatile player had been without a club for almost two years, before he surfaced at Chippa this season, and has looked impressive with his performances. 
Earlier in the season, when Chippa drew 1-1 with Downs in the league, Mashaba didn't play as he was an unused substitute for ex-Chilli Boys' coach Clinton Larsen.   
Meanwhile, it has also been confirmed from the Port Elizabeth club that former Orlando Pirates star Thabo Rakhale has also been struggling with an injury.
Both players missed the team's most recent Absa Premiership match – the 2-0 loss against Highlands Park last weekend.
