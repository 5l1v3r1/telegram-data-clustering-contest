Wisconsin Senate to vote on curbing governor's veto powers

01 Nov 2019, 21:07

MADISON, Wis. (AP) - The state Senate is poised to approve a constitutional amendment next week that would prohibit the governor from using his veto powers to increase spending.
The Senate is set to take up the amendment Tuesday. Approval is almost certain but the amendment's still a long way from ratification. Constitutional amendments must pass both legislative houses in two consecutive sessions as well as a statewide referendum. Tuesday's vote will mark the first time either the full Senate or Assembly has considered the proposal.
Republican lawmakers have been working to weaken Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' powers since he won election last year. He enraged Republicans in July when he used his partial veto powers to rewrite the state budget and give public schools $65 million more than GOP legislators had allocated.
