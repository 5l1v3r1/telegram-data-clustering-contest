保險科技大行其道！三類人才搶住請｜顏耀輝 Fred
01 Nov 2019, 21:07 by 顏耀輝 Fred
不少成功的初創領袖都說，其成功關鍵在於團隊，筆者非常同意。今次就跟大家談談筆者心中理想的金融科技人才是怎樣的。

回想10月下旬某週末，筆者出席了一個就業資訊日，與參加者分享業內的工作及對人才的要求。 當日活動由香港金融發展局舉辦，講者中不乏重量級嘉賓，例如財庫局局長劉怡翔先生及證監會主席雷添良先生等，筆者亦有幸獲邀出席，與一眾業界前輩及來自十大院校的同學們互相交流。 的確，近年金融科技逐漸成為業界的焦點，愈來愈多朋友對虛擬銀行及虛擬保險公司的職位感興趣。金融科技是較新的領域。不少人或想到，剛投身社會的畢業生，在這個「新世界」的競爭力能否與富有經驗的金融業從業員爭一日之長短呢？換句話講，虛擬銀行及虛擬保險公司需要的，究竟是哪一類人才呢？
保險科技工種合80、90後
筆者眼中理想的保險科技人才有以下三類： （1）傳統專業人士：他們擁有專業資格及一定的經驗，是團隊中不可或缺的，例如精算師，風險管理專家、會計師及索償專員等； （2）新世代專才：他們擁有某方面的才能，大多數是80、90後，適應力強，擁有互聯網市場的洞察力，例如UX設計師、系統工程師及市場營銷主任等； （3）金融 + 技術型人才：他們是「屈機」的人才。這類人可以掌握兩個領域的「語言」，了解金融業界的實際操作，同時具備專業技能去迎接科技上的挑戰；例子是擁有精算師資格的系統工程師，或是有核保經驗的註冊醫生等。 不論是哪類型的人才，都要懂得解決問題。要處理難題，必定要有分析力、要有創意、要充份理解工作的內容、要懂得去問對的問題。在傳統大型企業，絕大部份規則和做法都是既定的，甚至有白紙黑字去訂明，因此難以測試一個人真正解決問題的能力。



獨角獸愈來愈多
具體說個例子：筆者曾把同一份全新工作交予兩位實習生處理。懂得解決問題的那位只用了3日便完成；反觀另一位要花上3星期才完成。可見後者是個傳統執行者，卻不懂跳出框框思考及處理問題。 筆者強調解決問題的能力，是因為初創要求的是10倍成長，並不是邊際增長。要真正解決問題、 不只看CV  初創出身有保證 要由零做到一、要針對客戶真正的痛處，才能創造價值。 學歷及背景可作參考，但不是首要條件。筆者在招聘時不會只憑CV「揀卒」，反而期望求職者擁有高度的學習能力，同時要好奇心強。畢竟金融科技或保險科技都是「新世界」，這個世界變化極快，行業生態在5年之間可能已經面目全非。因此，實際上根本沒有所謂的專家，而停止學習的人很快便會被淘汰。
資訊日上，有參加者講到，加入初創工作使他面對來自家人的壓力。的確，不少父母都期望子女能任職傳統大型企業。這個問題就如純網保險一樣，需要時間去待大眾接受。 幸好，香港有愈來愈多獨角獸（Unicorns）公司出現，現時至少有8間，這個數字相對700多萬人口，比例上可謂世界之最。隨着更多初創成功個案出現，筆者相信會有更多人才樂意走進這個「新世界」。 此外，筆者十分認同資訊日上某位嘉賓說的話，在此分享一下：不要故作了解自己想要甚麼，先嘗試，不要太早下定論。

Insurance technology is popular! Three types of talents grabbed | Yan Yaohui Fred
01 Nov 2019, 21:07 by Yan Yaohui Fred
Many successful start-up leaders say that the key to their success lies in the team, and the author agrees very much. This time I will talk to you about the ideal financial technology talents in my heart.
Written by: Yan Yaohui Fred|Photo: iStock
Recalling a weekend in late October, the author attended an employment information day to share the industry's work and talent requirements with participants. The event was organised by the Hong Kong Financial Development Council. Among the speakers, there were many heavyweight guests, such as Mr. Liu Yixiang, the Secretary of the Treasury, and Mr. Lei Tianliang, the Chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission. The author was also fortunate to be invited to attend, with a group of predecessors and top ten from the industry. The students of the colleges communicate with each other. Indeed, in recent years, financial technology has gradually become the focus of the industry, and more and more friends are interested in the positions of virtual banks and virtual insurance companies. Financial technology is a relatively new field. Many people think that the graduates who have just joined the society can compete with the experienced financial industry practitioners for a long time in this ""new world"" competitiveness. In other words, what kind of talent is needed for virtual banks and virtual insurance companies?
Insurance technology jobs 80, 90
The ideal insurance technology talents in the eyes of the author have the following three categories: (1) Traditional professionals: they have professional qualifications and certain experience, which are indispensable in the team, such as actuaries, risk management experts, accountants and claims specialists; (2) New generations of professionals: they have certain talents, most of them are 80, 90, adaptable, and have the insight of the Internet market, such as UX designers, system engineers and marketing directors; (3) Financial + technical talents: They are the talents of the ""model machine."" Such people can master the ""language"" of the two fields, understand the actual operation of the financial industry, and have the professional skills to meet the technical challenges; examples are system engineers with qualifications as actuaries, or registered doctors with experience in underwriting Wait. No matter what type of talent, you must know how to solve the problem. To deal with the problem, you must have analytical power, be creative, fully understand the content of the work, and know how to ask the right questions. In traditional large enterprises, most of the rules and practices are established, and even black and white are prescribed, so it is difficult to test a person's ability to solve problems.



More and more unicorns
Specifically, the author has given the same new job to two interns. It took only three days to complete the problem, and it took another three weeks to complete. It can be seen that the latter is a traditional performer, but does not understand the box to think and deal with the problem. The author emphasizes the ability to solve problems because the requirements for start-ups are 10 times growth, not marginal growth. To really solve the problem, not only to see the CV start-up is guaranteed to be done by zero, to be true to the customer's pain, in order to create value. Education and background can be used as a reference, but not a prerequisite. The author does not rely solely on CV to “take a pawn” when recruiting. Instead, he expects job seekers to have a high level of learning ability and be curious. After all, financial technology or insurance technology is a ""new world"". The world is changing very fast. The industry ecology may have been beyond recognition for five years. Therefore, there is actually no so-called expert at all, and those who stop learning will soon be eliminated.
On the information day, some participants said that joining the start-up work made him face pressure from his family. Indeed, many parents expect their children to serve traditional large enterprises. This problem is just like pure-net insurance, and it takes time to accept it. Fortunately, there are more and more Unicorns companies in Hong Kong. At present, there are at least 8 companies. This number is more than 7 million people, which is the highest in the world. With more successful start-up cases, I believe that more talents will be willing to enter this ""new world."" In addition, the author agrees with what a guest said on the Information Day, and share it here: Don't pretend to know what you want, try it first, don't make it too early.
