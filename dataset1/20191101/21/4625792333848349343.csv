Beto O'Rourke drops out of 2020 presidential race
01 Nov 2019, 21:30 by Joseph Simonson
Beto O'Rourke has ended his bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
The former Texas congressman made the announcement on Friday in a series of tweets, saying, ""I am announcing that my service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee.""









Despite several campaign resets and an impressive fundraising haul of $6.1 million in the first 24 hours following announcing his White House run, the former Texas congressman failed to capture the excitement that surrounded his 2018 Senate race.
While that effort to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz failed, O'Rourke, 46, became a media darling and set the record for receiving the most votes by a Democrat in state history.
O'Rourke's narrow loss to Cruz set the tone for his presidential campaign, where he argued that he could compete in states traditionally held by Republicans. Yet O'Rourke failed to gain significant momentum and consistently polled with 1%-2% in primary polls.
During his presidential campaign, O'Rourke ruled out another Senate run. From 2013 to 2019, O'Rourke served as a congressman for Texas's 16th Congressional District.
