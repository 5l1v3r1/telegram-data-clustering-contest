What We Are Reading Today: Protest! by Liz McQuiston

Andrea del Verrocchio (c. 1435–1488) was one of the most versatile and inventive artists of the Italian Renaissance. He created art across media, from his spectacular sculptures and paintings to his work in goldsmithing, architecture, and engineering. 
His expressive, confident drawings provide a key point of contact between sculpture and painting. He led a vibrant workshop where he taught young artists who later became some of the greatest painters of the period, including Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, Lorenzo di Credi, and Domenico Ghirlandaio. 
This beautifully illustrated book presents a comprehensive survey of Verrocchio’s art, spanning his entire career and featuring some 50 sculptures, paintings, and drawings, in addition to works he created with his students, says a review on the Princeton University Press website. 
Through incisive scholarly essays, in-depth catalog entries, and breathtaking illustrations, this volume draws on the latest research in art history to show why Verrocchio was one of the most innovative and influential of all Florentine artists.
