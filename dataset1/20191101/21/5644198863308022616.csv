Fitbit shares have gained more than 40per cent since Reuters exclusively reported on Monday that Google had made an offer for the maker of the popular colorful fitness trackers.
While Google has joined other major technology companies such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd in developing smart phones, it has yet to develop any wearable offerings.
Qatalyst Partners LLP acted as financial adviser to Fitbit, while Fenwick & West LLP was its legal adviser.
