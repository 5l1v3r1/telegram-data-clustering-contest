Custom figure artist Dau Lau Boc Khoi has been bringing to life awkward Gundam animation in hand-sculpted polymer clay.
Early Gundam animation was not so great and produced some truly awkward, meme-worthy examples of bad animation. Those images now live on as sculptures.
“Quick project for a stressful week,” wrote the artist on Facebook.

Typically, Dau Lau Boc Khoi does kickass commissions like this, so it’s fun to see him let loose with these humorous pieces.
