Pred štirimi leti so ga odkrili v divjini v okolici Canberre: bil je povsem sam, nadvse počasnih gibov, videti je bil nadvse upehan, skorajda obupan. Nič nenavadnega, saj je imel na plečih, no, kar vsepovsod, samo volno: tako zelo izdatno, da so je nazadnje natehtali 41,1 kilograma.
Našli so ga v divjini, ko je bil star šest let.
Čast, da je postrigel obilnega ovna in nagrmadil toliko volne, je doletela svetovnega prvaka na tem področju Iana Elkinsa, ki je odkrito priznal, da česa takšnega še ni doživel v svoji bogati, 35-letni karieri. Ker je bilo delo tako zahtevno, so mu pomagali štirje izurjeni pomočniki, po dolgotrajnem delu pa so bili nagrajeni z vpisom v Guinnessovo knjigo rekordov. Chris, kot so poimenovali ovna, je bil po njihovi oceni star šest let, torej ga toliko let ni nihče obril, kar je nevarno ogrožalo tudi njegovo zdravje. Da se to ne bi več ponovilo, so se za oskrbnike ponudila številna društva za varovanje zapuščenih živali in ovčje farme pa tudi številni posamezniki, ki bi se seveda z veseljem bahali, da je njihov varovanec rekorder zaradi svojega obilnega runa.Dokler ni svet spoznal Chrisa, se je z laskavim nazivom kitila ovca Big Ben, ki so ji leta 2014 odstranili 29 kilogramov volne.Chrisa so nazadnje posvojili na farmi Little Oak Sanctuary, kjer je živel s še 180 nekoč brezdomnimi živalmi, tam pa je veljal za izjemno prijaznega in nežnega varovanca z nadvse prijazno dušo in velikim srcem. Ob smrti je bil star okoli 10 let, ocenjujejo, doživel je dokaj povprečno življenjsko dobo. »A za nas ni bil samo oven, ki je imel največ volne na svetu. Bil je veliko več ... Počivaj v miru, Chris!«


S takšnim bogastvom se je vpisal v Guinnessovo knjigo rekordov.

He said goodbye to the wool recorder
Chris made a whopping 41 pounds of wool four years ago. He lived on a farm with 180 other animals, considered to be kind and gentle.
01 Nov 2019, 21:06 by E.B.
Four years ago, he was discovered in the wilderness of Canberra: he was completely alone, in slow motion, looking haughty, almost desperate. Not unusual, as he had on his shoulders, well, all around, only wool: so rich that they last weighed 41.1 pounds.
He was found in the wild when he was six years old.
The honor of cutting a lot of rams and piling up so much wool has come across world champion Ian Elkins, who has openly admitted that he has never experienced anything like this in his rich, 35-year career. Because the work was so demanding, he was assisted by four trained assistants, and after long work, he was rewarded with an entry in the Guinness Book of Records. Chris, as they were called rams, was six years old, so nobody shaved him for so many years, which also threatened his health. To prevent this from happening again, many caretakers and abandoned sheep farmers were offered caretakers, as well as a number of individuals who would, of course, be glad that their protégé was a record holder because of his abundant runes. Until the world met Chris , with the flattering title of Big Ben Sheep, was removed, removing 29 pounds of wool in 2014. Chris was last adopted at Little Oak Sanctuary, where he lived with 180 once homeless animals, and was considered extremely friendly and gentle a guard with a very kind soul and a big heart. At the time of his death, he was about 10 years old, it is estimated he had a fairly average life expectancy. “But it wasn't just the ram that had the most wool in the world. He was so much more ... Rest in peace, Chris! ""


With such wealth, he enrolled in the Guinness Book of Records.
