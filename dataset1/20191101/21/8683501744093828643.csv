Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse 2’s Official Release Date Has Been Announced

Last year, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse pleased critics and audiences, as well as brought home a very prestigious win for Best Animated Feature at this year’s Academy Awards. So with a movie that beloved, you’d want to know when a sequel was going to happen, right?
Well, as it turns out, that big tease that Sony dropped earlier was leading to just that information. And as you’ll see in the tweet below, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse 2, or whatever the full title of this Spider-Verse sequel may be, will be arriving in theaters on:



With this information now public, a bigger picture starts to form for not only 2022’s release calendar, but also where Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse’s sequel will fit in with the Disney/Marvel release schedule as well. Landing an April 8th, 2022 release date puts the film in the middle of two upcoming Marvel Studios films: an untitled release slated for February 18th, 2022, and Black Panther II’s May 6th, 2022 drop date.
One would assume this announcement happened right about now as a by-product of the recent Spider-Man negotiations that cleared up between Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures. While this isn’t exactly a property that Disney’s half of the aisle would be participating in, as it would clearly be a Sony Pictures Animation project, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse’s follow-up would have either competed with the Marvel Cinematic Universe or cooperated with it.
We have our answer now thanks to the official Spider-Verse Twitter, as this project will be perfectly timed to keep the good times rolling, with both sides of the equation benefitting from the lack of scheduling.
There are some interesting questions to ask following this Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse sequel announcement, especially after the Marvel/Sony bridge has been repaired. For instance, will this film count towards the three to four movie cycle that Marvel Studios is looking to maintain in the near future? Also, does this mean that there’s more or less of a chance for characters from Tom Holland’s Spider-Man franchise to cross over into this animated universe, and vice versa? Most importantly, could we finally see Tobey Maguire and/or Andrew Garfield’s variants of Peter Parker appear, or does the whole MCU connection dampen the mood on that particular 'what if'?
It’s all possible, and may have already been debated in the writer’s room, as a sequel to Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse has been discussed for some time, but now has officially been confirmed. So you’d think there’s already a story and some animation work taking place if we’re going to see this film in a little over two years.
Anything can happen between now and this slated release date, but it just feels good to be able to say that Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse 2 (again, the official title has yet to be revealed), will be in theaters on April 8th, 2022. Should anything change, or any additional information be provided, you can count on CinemaBlend to web up the details and sling them your way!
