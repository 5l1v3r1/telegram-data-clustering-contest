A decorated Army officer who was on Donald Trump's infamous July phone call with the leader of Ukraine says he was instructed by a White House lawyer not to tell anyone about that call, days after he brought forward his concerns about that conversation.
Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a decorated Army officer who was previously the National Security Council director for Ukraine, told Congress during closed-door testimony this week that he had originally gone to White House lawyer John Eisenberg to express concerns about the 25 July phone call, in which Mr Trump appeared to ask Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden in exchange for the release of American security aide for the country.
In response, Mr Vindman told House investigators, records from the phone call were moved onto a top secret server system. Then, days later, Mr Vindman says that Mr Eisenberg approached him and asked him not to tell anyone about the phone call — which concerned him further since his job was to coordinate interagency processes related to Ukraine.
