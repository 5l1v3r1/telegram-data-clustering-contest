從風向看「屯門不明氣體」的來源
01 Nov 2019, 08:10 by 林超英


我們想讓你知道的是凡事必須用常識和道理去分析，才決定應對行動，切要避免先入為主，或者被怨憤和仇恨蒙蔽心思，否則容易做錯事，將來後悔莫及。



10月28日下午三時後，屯門地區陸續有不明氣體報告，受影響的人有不同徵狀，包括流鼻水、咳嗽和嘔吐，有小童皮膚痕癢和出紅疹。
傳媒朋友29日向我查詢時，我查看天文台和環保署的空氣污染紀錄，注意到28日下午屯門吹西北偏北微風，臭氣水平28日中午後飇升超過100水平，一氧化碳超過1000水平，PM10和PM2.5都上升，是典型北風把北面的污染空氣吹到香港境的情況，所以向記者表示也許這是事件的原因。
但是到了30日，見到報章報道事件對人的影響似乎比一般臭氣侵襲大，朋友甚至告訴我相當數目的小竉物死亡，因此我借用報章的細緻內容，嘗試還原28日的情景，首先看大環境。


圖1 屯門、青山一帶立體圖，10月28日下午吹西北偏北風1-6標記不明氣體報告位置（見內文）

10月28日下午屯門一帶吹西北偏西風，從圖1可見，就算靶場有任何氣體產生，都會隨風飄出海，加上青山劏在屯門和靶場之間，靶場可以剔除出可疑名單。
消防署收到不明氣體報告的18個地點（註1），大致在圖中標記1至6的範圍內，1是良景邨，2是寶山邨，3是屯門天主教學校（大興行動中心在附近），4是山景邨，5是永隆中學，6是洪祥路，是今次事件中有報告的最南地點，其中寶山邨沒有消防署報告，是根據其他報章報道加上去的。
為了了解不明氣體的移動情況，分析了各個消防報告的時間，以圖2概栝展示，1和4標記最西界，3和5標記最東界，6是最南的報告。最早十五分鐘的報告全部來自黑圈之內，其後報告的範圍逐步向南擴展。


圖2 不明氣體報告範圍黑色圈：3:30 – 3:45 報告範圍；紅色圈：3:46 – 4:00 增加範圍；藍色圈：4:00 – 4:30 增加範圍。

首先值得注意的是報告局限在一條「走廊」，兩旁的地區似乎不受影響，這個圖像否定了臭氧之類區域性污染的說法，而指向一個規模不太大局部地區性的源頭，其次是氣體逐步向南擴散，走廊的方向與背景的西北偏西風大致吻合，其三是自6再往南沒有報告，即是不明氣體一路走一路稀釋變淡，很快達到人感覺不到的水平，最後一點，不明氣體維持一段時間後就沒有了，顯示源頭是短暫排放，可能是人控制的。
另外有一段值得注意的新聞：位於良景邨以北，寶山邨附近的礦山村，一個動物收容所稱接近四時人和動物都出現咳、流眼淚和鼻水，甚至嘔吐，需要緊急撤離（註2），礦山村的位置標記在圖2。
根據以上材料，我們回答大興行動中心是否今次事件的不明氣體源頭。受影響的礦山村和寶山邨（圖1和圖2標為「2」），都位於大興行動基地的東北方，如果基地有釋放不明氣體，在偏北風控制下，不可能飄到這兩個地方，因此可以否定基地是源頭，此外圖2可見行動中心位於氣體走廊東側而不是正中，是一個它不是氣體源頭的旁證，然則源頭是哪裏？我們可以用立體地形點檢視一下。


圖3 氣體擴散立體地形圖

礦山村位於氣體走廊上游，後面只有山，再沒有其他民居點或工廠區，看來有關部門應該去看一下。
寫到這裏，要為警察喊冤，事發當晚屯門有人在沒有科學調查之下，指是警察秘密放催淚煙，聚眾鬧事，結果搞到真的要放催淚煙驅散，現在梳理資料之後，顯示不明氣體來自他處，當日到街上鬧事的人不知有何感想？
凡事必須用常識和道理去分析，才決定應對行動，切要避免先入為主，或者被怨憤和仇恨蒙蔽心思，否則容易做錯事，將來後悔莫及。

Looking at the source of ""unknown gas of Tuen Mun"" from the wind direction
01 Nov 2019, 08:10 by Lin Chaoying


What we want you to know is that everything must be analyzed with common sense and reason before deciding to respond. It is necessary to avoid preconceptions or to be blinded by grievances and hatred. Otherwise, it is easy to do wrong things and regret it in the future.



After 3 pm on October 28, there were reports of unknown gas in the Tuen Mun area. The affected people had different symptoms, including runny nose, cough and vomiting, and itchy skin and rash.
When the media friends asked me about the air pollution records of the Observatory and the Environmental Protection Agency on the 29th, I noticed that the northwest northwest breeze was blowing in the Tuen Mun on the afternoon of the 28th. The odor level soared over 100 levels after noon on the 28th, and the carbon monoxide exceeded 1000 levels. Both PM10 and PM2.5 are rising. It is the case that the typical north wind blows the polluted air in the north to Hong Kong. So I told reporters that this may be the cause of the incident.
However, on the 30th, I saw that the newspaper reported that the impact on the people seemed to be greater than that of the general stench. My friends even told me that a considerable number of small stolen goods died. Therefore, I borrowed the detailed contents of the newspaper to try to restore the 28th scene. Look at the big environment.


Figure 1 A perspective view of the Tuen Mun and Castle Peak areas. On the afternoon of October 28, the northwest wind northerly winds 1-6 marked unidentified gas reporting position (see text)

On the afternoon of October 28th, the west wind was blowing in the Tuen Mun area. As can be seen from Figure 1, even if there is any gas generated in the shooting range, it will drift out of the sea with the wind, and the Qingshan Mountain will be able to remove the suspicious list between the Tuen Mun and the shooting range.
The Fire Department received 18 locations for unidentified gas reports (Note 1), which are generally within the range of 1 to 6 in the figure. 1 is Liangjing Village, 2 is Baoshan Village, and 3 is Tuen Mun Catholic School (Daxing Action Center is nearby.) ), 4 is a mountain village, 5 is Wing Lung Secondary School, and 6 is Hong Cheung Road. It is the southernmost location reported in this incident. There is no report from the Fire Department in Baoshan Village. It is added according to other newspaper reports.
In order to understand the movement of unknown gas, the time of each fire report was analyzed. It is shown in Figure 2. The 1st and 4th marks are the westernmost, the 3rd and 5th mark are the most eastern, and the 6th is the southernmost report. The first fifteen minutes of the report came from the black circle, and the scope of the subsequent report gradually expanded southward.


Figure 2 Unknown gas report range Black circle: 3:30 – 3:45 Report range; Red circle: 3:46 – 4:00 Increase range; Blue circle: 4:00 – 4:30 Increase range.

First of all, it is worth noting that the report is limited to a “corridor”. The areas on both sides seem to be unaffected. This image denies the idea of regional pollution such as ozone, and points to a source that is not too large in size, followed by The gas gradually spreads southward, and the direction of the corridor is roughly consistent with the west-westerly wind of the background. The third is that there is no report from the 6th to the south, that is, the unknown gas all the way to dilute and fade, and soon reach the level that people can not feel, and finally One point, the unknown gas is not maintained after a period of time, indicating that the source is a short-term discharge, which may be controlled by humans.
There is also a noteworthy news: located in the mine village near Baoshan Village, north of Liangjing Village, an animal shelter said that cough, tears and nasal water, and even vomiting, and emergency evacuation are required near the four o'clock. 2) The location of the mine village is marked in Figure 2.
Based on the above materials, we answered whether the Daxing Action Center is the source of unknown gas for this incident. The affected mine village and Baoshan Village (labeled ""2"" in Figure 1 and Figure 2) are located in the northeast of the Daxing Action Base. If the base has unreleased gas, it is impossible to float to the two under the control of the northerly wind. Place, so it can be denied that the base is the source. In addition, Figure 2 shows that the action center is located on the east side of the gas corridor rather than in the middle. It is a circumstantial evidence that it is not the source of gas. However, where is the source? We can use the stereoscopic point to view it.


Figure 3 Gas diffusion three-dimensional topographic map

The mine village is located in the upper reaches of the gas corridor, and there are only mountains in the back. There are no other residential areas or factory areas. It seems that the relevant departments should look at it.
Written here, to shout for the police, the night of the incident, there is no scientific investigation, it is the police secretly let tears, gather people to make trouble, the result is really to tears to disperse, now comb the information, show Unknown gas comes from other places, people who went to the streets on the same day did not know what to think?
Everything must be analyzed with common sense and reason before deciding to respond to action. It is necessary to avoid preconceptions or to be blinded by grievances and hatred. Otherwise, it is easy to do wrong things and regret it in the future.
