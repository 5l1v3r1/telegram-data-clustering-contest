Hi Everyone,I'm super happy to announce the release of my new course, ""The art of effective rigging in Blender"".It's a 100% Blender rigging course that will fit both beginners and more advanced riggers. I've put a lot of energy in this course and took the time to edit it as well as I could with the help of Tom Murphy and Fin O'Riordan. I will run a special offer until Sunday the 3rd with the course at only 35$ instead of 49$.If you want to know more about the course, just check out the announcement video right here.You will find all the links to buy the course in the video description.Hope you will like it.
