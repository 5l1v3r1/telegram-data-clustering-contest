他們因在馬來西亞讀了國民黨認定的「禁書」，就被警總禁止再入境台灣
01 Nov 2019, 08:30 by 杜晉軒
戒嚴時期的台灣，國民黨當局對人民的結社自由有嚴格的管控，尤其對校園中任何宣揚左翼理念的讀書會戒慎恐懼，當然這以反共之名對校園的控制，是不分本國人或外國人的。
隨著電影《返校》所帶起的熱潮，許多人談論到戒嚴時期有的台灣人因參與了讀書會，而從此「消失」了，也許他們的名字還被人記著，被口述歷史、學者研究給記載了下來，然而更鮮為人知的，還有在戒嚴時期也涉入「讀書會」疑雲的馬來西亞僑生。
根據筆者從國史館所獲得的史料，1969年台灣警總、國安局等情治單位「偵破」了一宗由5名馬國僑生組成的「匪黨」組織，當局稱他們思想左傾，在馬國組過「讀書會」等云云。
筆者要提醒的是，儘管官方已解密了許多戒嚴時期的政治檔案，但諸如偵訊筆錄、自白書等官方檔案，多有可能是當事人在遭受脅迫的情況下而寫的，亦有可能是國民黨當局事後捏造的，因此對於任何政治檔案仍需保持質疑的態度，而以下所引述的檔案內容，亦有可能非事件的全貌。由於當事人仍在世，且不願多談，為保護當事人隱私，故本文將當事人化名做處理。
鎮海專案座談會
1969年1月17日，警總召開一場秘密座談會，探討如何逮捕五名思想左傾的馬國僑生。出席單位包括國民黨中央黨部第三組與第六組、僑委會、知識青年黨部、教育部軍訓處、外交部亞太司、國安局（列席指導）等，當局將該場會議命名為「鎮海專案座談會」。
「鎮海專案座談會」共召開了兩次。首次會議決議由警總領導下進行秘密逮捕行動，而該行動以不在校內和公共場所逮捕對象為原則，並決議扣押後將人押送至軍法處收案，再發由警總保安處偵訊。列席指導的國安局稱「本案可能為匪黨變型之組織，請警備總部徹底澄清….請各支援單位與警總密切協同配合進行，防止意外演變。在外交、僑情及國內反應方面妥為肆應」。
第一波逮捕行動發生於1月20日晚上，被當局視為「組織」領導人的台北文化大學僑生肖南遭扣押帶走，而就讀成大的汪榮和中興大學的曉嵐也在同一晚被帶走。第二波逮捕行動則在2月8日晚上，被帶走的是就讀台大的嚴平和小美。
根據解密的偵訊筆錄記載，涉案的5名馬國僑生在1966年畢業於馬國芙蓉市的某華文中學後，是經同學柳元的兄長柳宗的「誘惑」下，閱讀了《浪花》、《黃黎園罷工特輯》、《毛語錄》、「匪作家」魯迅等人「匪書」才開始思想左傾；具體行動包括在曉嵐家中設立小型圖書館辦「讀書會」，相互研究「匪書」與交換心得，而該「讀書會」1967年6月25日被馬國政治部發覺。調查報告指出，由於曉嵐的二哥是執政黨中人，他們才得以免於牢獄之災。

尋找升學機會
當時中國大陸正值文化大革命，立場左派的馬國華裔學生也難以赴大陸留學，因為馬國未與大陸建交，也禁止人民赴陸，否則可能面臨國籍被撤銷的風險，因此推行僑教政策的台灣成了許多馬國華裔學生的選擇。
鑑於當時國民黨的反共國策，若馬國華裔高中畢業生欲來台升學，得向居住地的保薦人（多為曾經的國民黨人，由於馬國政府禁止國民黨活動，已轉為地下了），或保薦單位（馬國各州的中華大會堂）尋求推薦來台，而這些保薦人在審核申請人時，若查獲他們有思想左傾、參加過學生運動，最終多不獲推薦來台，或被台灣官方拒絕錄取。因此肖南等五名被遣返的學生，當年來台前的被審核情況為何，則不得而知了。
調查報告指控肖南等五人於1967年8月赴台留學前，柳宗「命」他們要堅定政治思想，因為台灣是反動政權、資本主義社會，並期待他們未來返國後跟隨他從事社會主義運動。
肖南等人來台留學後，警總稱他們常在假日聚會，還與柳宗、柳元二人保持通信聯繫，同時柳宗還寄馬國報章剪報與「毛語錄」給他們。然而根據公開的官方檔案，卻未見官方所扣押的任何剪報或「毛語錄」，故尚不得知這情節的真偽。
調查報告記述，在肖南等五人被捕前的兩個月，肖南收到親友的來信，而信上的郵票背面有字跡，寫著柳宗已被馬國政府逮捕等訊息，而肖南再寫信函告知其他人應「沉著應對」。
他們五人被捕後是被分開偵訊的，警總稱五人的口供相當「吻合」。警總的研析結果指出，由於馬國政府實行對「華僑」歧視的政策下，因此他們是透過閱讀「匪書」、收聽「匪播」，又受到友人柳宗影響下，導致思想「傾匪」。
從扣押到遣返
1969年3月，對於要如何處理這五位學生，國民黨當局內部充滿分歧，主因為台灣與馬國關係正處重要的時刻。當時中華民國駐吉隆坡領事館獲馬國政府允准升格為「總領事館」，國民黨深怕任何風吹草動會讓「中馬關係」倒退。
因此3月再召開的「鎮海專案」會議中，就討論如何處置這五位學生，是該讓他們臣服於「祖國」的法威，還是該遣送回「僑居地」。也許顧忌到馬國「僑情」的不良反應，甚至擔心未來會影響招收馬國僑生的「業績」，僑委會表達了該遣返的立場。僑委會的韓繼伍表示，遣返前應告訴學生家人，如果學生家人有不便之處，則應讓5位學生自動請求退學較妥。
然而國民黨知識青年黨部的汪崇仁對此提出異議，他認為採取遣返的做法過於草率，他堅決此事件應以予法辦。不過同為國民黨體系的中央委員會第三組的立場較知識青年黨部緩和，由於該組負責經營海外華僑關係，因此對「僑界」反應較敏感，如該組的萬國柱同意該遣返學生，因為不論法辦或遣返都不失為一種處分。
萬國柱強調，過去蔣介石對於馬國的問題曾有指示：「勿與馬發生誤會，要爭取馬之邦交」。
最終第二次「鎮海專案」會議主席徐人雋少將決議，將遣返五名學生。
1969年4月25日，肖南等5名學生在警總人員監護下搭乘招商局的海亞號郵輪回「僑居地」，而當局在行前除函告學生們的家長將在新加坡上岸外，也將他們的案情資料交給馬國政府，馬國駐台領事館也回函感謝提供反共僑報。學生們被遣返5天後，警總在發給各部會的報告中稱，未來這5位馬國學生將被禁止入境台灣。
最終這幾位被遣返的學長姐的命運為何，筆者透過已退休的馬國中文報記者陳駒騰先生那，聯繫上了肖南與嚴平。雖然他倆不願再多談往事，但嚴平先生仍將部分經歷分享予陳駒騰先生。
嚴平告訴陳駒騰，他們在台灣沒有搞共產活動，他們之所以被抓，與他們在高中時期成立學生社團——華文學會有關，當時他們確實談了一些進步思想的東西，還有讀了巴金、魯迅作品。嚴平也同陳駒騰為肖南平反，他稱肖南並非所謂中心人物，他們當時確實在台讀了左派書籍，由於彼此分散在台灣各大學，為了分享讀書心得，他們只好以「限時掛號」傳閱書籍與讀書心得，最終遭台灣政府查獲而出事⋯⋯
嚴平跟陳駒騰透露，他們被扣押期間沒遭到酷刑，起初國民黨當局確實想讓他們服刑坐牢，但由於台灣得到了在馬成立總領事館的機會，因此在外交因素下才得以被遣返。
以上就是嚴平對陳駒騰的說法。曾經留學台灣政治大學新聞系的陳駒騰感慨地告訴筆者，國民黨就這樣毀了幾個學生的前程，他們被遣返後就沒繼續求學，陳駒騰為他們的境遇深感遺憾…
由此可見，過去國民黨當局對言論自由的管控，不僅不分本國人或外國人（基於大中華主義的意識形態，也不完全視外籍華人為外國人，而是「華僑」），也「溯及既往」，試圖無孔不入地控制僑生群體的思維。

They were forbidden to re-enter Taiwan because they read the ""forbidden book"" recognized by the Kuomintang in Malaysia.
01 Nov 2019, 08:30 by Du Jinxuan
During the martial law period, the Kuomintang authorities had strict control over the freedom of association of the people, especially those who read the left-wing concept on the campus. Of course, this is the control of the campus in the name of anti-communism, regardless of nationals or foreign countries. Human.
With the craze brought by the film ""Back to School"", many people talked about the Taiwanese who participated in the book club during the martial law period, and since then ""disappeared"", perhaps their names are still remembered, dictated by history, Scholars have documented it, but it is even less well known. There are also Malaysian overseas Chinese who are involved in the ""Book Club"" during the martial law.
According to the historical data obtained by the author from the National History Museum, in 1969, the Taiwan Police Chief, the National Security Bureau and other sentiment units ""detected"" a ""squatting party"" composed of five Malaysian overseas Chinese students. The authorities said that they thought left, in the horse. The country group has a ""book club"" and other clouds.
The author should remind that although the official has declassified many political files during the martial law period, official files such as transcripts of transcripts and confession books may be written by the parties under coercion, or may be the Kuomintang. The authorities fabricated it afterwards, so it is still necessary to maintain a questioning attitude towards any political archives. The contents of the archives quoted below may also be non-event. Since the parties are still alive and do not want to talk more, in order to protect the privacy of the parties, this article will treat the party's pseudonym.
Zhenhai project symposium
On January 17, 1969, the police convened a secret symposium to discuss how to arrest five Ma’s overseas students who left the country. The attendees included the third and sixth groups of the Kuomintang Central Party Department, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, the Intellectual Youth Party Department, the Military Training Department of the Ministry of Education, the Asia-Pacific Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the National Security Bureau (in attendance). The authorities named the meeting "" Zhenhai project symposium.""
The ""Zhenhai Project Symposium"" was held twice. The first meeting decided to conduct a secret arrest operation under the leadership of the police chief. The operation was based on the principle of not arresting the object in the school and in public places. After detaining the case, the person was escorted to the Military Law Office and then sent to the police headquarters for investigation. The National Security Bureau, which was instructed to attend, said that ""this case may be a party-type change organization. Please mobilize the headquarters for thorough clarification.... Please support the support units in close coordination with the police chief to prevent accidental evolution. In terms of diplomacy, overseas Chinese and domestic response, Ying Ying.""
The first wave of arrests took place on the evening of January 20th. Xiaonan, a Chinese cultural student of the Taipei Cultural University, regarded by the authorities as the leader of the organization, was detained and taken away, while Wang Rong, who was enrolled in the university, and Xiaoxiao, who was from Zhongxing University, were also in the same Was taken away late. The second wave of arrests was carried out on the evening of February 8. Yan Ping and Xiao Mei, who were taken to Taiwan University.
According to the declassified transcript of the investigation, the five Ma Guoqiao students who were involved in the case graduated from a Chinese-language high school in Furong City, Malaysia in 1966. They read ""The Waves"" under the ""temptation"" of the brother Liu Yuan of the classmate Liu Yuan. The ""Huang Li Yuan strike special edition"", ""Mao Quotations"", ""匪 Writer"" Lu Xun and other ""Sui Shu"" began to think left. The specific actions include setting up a small library to set up a ""Reading Club"" in Xiaolan's home, and studying each other. With the exchange of experience, and the ""Reading Club"" was discovered by the Malaysian Political Department on June 25, 1967. According to the investigation report, since Xiao's second brother is a ruling party, they are saved from prison.

Looking for opportunities for further studies
At that time, the Chinese mainland was in the midst of the Cultural Revolution. It was difficult for the Malaysian students of the left-wing position to study in the mainland. Because Malaysia did not establish diplomatic relations with the mainland, it also prohibited people from going to the land. Otherwise, it may face the risk of the nationality being revoked. Taiwan has become the choice of many Malaysian Chinese students.
In view of the anti-Communist national policy of the Kuomintang at that time, if the Malay Chinese high school graduates wanted to come to Taiwan to study, they would have to go to the sponsor of the place of residence (mostly the Kuomintang, because the Malaysian government banned the Kuomintang activities, it has been turned underground), or The sponsors (the Chinese City Halls in the states of Malaysia) seek to recommend to Taiwan. When these applicants check their applicants, if they find that they have left-leaning and participated in the student movement, they will not be recommended to come to Taiwan or be officially Taiwan. Refuse to accept. Therefore, it is unclear why the five repatriated students, such as Xiao Nan, were audited before the stage.
The investigation report alleged that Xiaonan and other five people went to Taiwan to study in August 1967. Liu Zong ""life"" they must strengthen their political thinking, because Taiwan is a reactionary regime, a capitalist society, and expects them to follow the society after returning to China. Movement.
After Xiaonan and others came to Taiwan to study, the police said that they often met at the holiday, and they also kept in communication with Liu Zong and Liu Yuan. At the same time, Liu Zong also sent the Malaysian newspaper clippings and ""Mao Quotations"" to them. However, according to the official archives of the public, there are no newspaper clippings or ""hair quotations"" that the official has seized. Therefore, the truth of this plot is not known.
According to the investigation report, Xiao Nan received a letter from relatives and friends two months before Xiao Nan and other five people were arrested. The stamp on the letter has a handwriting on the back of the stamp, which reads that Liu Zong has been arrested by the Malaysian government. South wrote a letter to tell others that they should ""sit calmly.""
After the five people were arrested, they were separately investigated. The police chief said that the confession of the five people was quite ""matching."" The results of the police analysis pointed out that because the Malaysian government implemented the policy of discrimination against ""Overseas Chinese"", they read the ""Sui Shu"" and listened to the ""Speech"" and were influenced by the friend Liu Zong. bandit"".
From seizure to repatriation
In March 1969, the Kuomintang authorities were full of disagreements about how to deal with the five students. The main reason is that Taiwan’s relations with Malaysia are at an important moment. At that time, the Consulate of the Republic of China in Kuala Lumpur was approved by the Malaysian government to be upgraded to the ""Consulate General"". The Kuomintang is afraid that any turmoil will make ""China-Malaysia relations"" retrogress.
Therefore, in the ""Zhenhai Project"" meeting held in March, it was discussed whether to dispose of the five students, whether they should surrender to the ""homeland"" of the Fa-Wei, or whether they should be sent back to the ""homes of the country."" Perhaps the scruples of the adverse reactions of the ""nationality"" of Malaysia, and even fear that the future will affect the ""performance"" of recruiting overseas Chinese students, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee expressed its position of repatriation. Han Jiwu of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee said that the family members should be told before the repatriation. If the students and family members have any inconvenience, it should be appropriate for the five students to automatically request the withdrawal.
However, Wang Chongren of the Kuomintang Intellectual Youth Party Department objected to this. He believed that the practice of repatriation was too hasty, and he insisted that the incident should be punished. However, the position of the third group of the Central Committee, which is also the Kuomintang system, is more moderate than that of the Intellectual Youth Party. Because the group is responsible for operating overseas Chinese relations, it is more sensitive to the response of the “Qiao Guo”. If the group’s Wan Guozhu agrees to repatriate the students, Because whether it is law or repatriation is a punishment.
Wan Guozhu stressed that in the past, Chiang Kai-shek had instructed the Malaysian issue: ""Do not misunderstand the horse, and strive to win the diplomatic relations with the horse.""
In the end, the chairman of the second ""Zhenhai Project"" meeting, Major General Xu Renjun, decided to repatriate five students.
On April 25, 1969, Xiaonan and other five students returned to the ""Residential Residence"" by the China Merchants' Haiya Cruise under the supervision of the police officers. Before the trip, the authorities announced that the parents of the students would go ashore in Singapore. They also handed over their case information to the Malaysian government, and the Malaysian Consulate in Taiwan also wrote a letter thanking the anti-communist overseas newspaper. Five days after the students were repatriated, the police chief said in a report to the ministries that the five Malaysian students will be banned from entering Taiwan in the future.
In the end, the fate of these repatriated seniors, the author through the retired Ma Guo Chinese newspaper reporter Chen Yiteng, contacted Xiao Nan and Yan Ping. Although they are not willing to talk more about the past, Mr. Yan Ping still shares some experiences with Mr. Chen Yuteng.
Yan Ping told Chen Ruteng that they did not engage in communist activities in Taiwan. They were arrested and they were related to the establishment of a student association in the high school period, the Chinese Literature Association. At the time, they did talk about some things that were progressive and read. Ba Jin and Lu Xun's works. Yan Ping is also the same as Chen Nanteng for Xiao Nanping. He said that Xiao Nan is not a central figure. They did read the left-wing books in Taiwan. Because they were scattered in Taiwan universities, in order to share their reading experiences, they had to use ""time-limited registration."" Circulating books and reading experiences, and finally being seized by the Taiwan government.
Yan Ping and Chen Ruteng revealed that they were not tortured during their detention. At first, the Kuomintang authorities really wanted them to serve their sentences in prison. However, because Taiwan had the opportunity to establish a consulate in Malaysia, it was able to be repatriated under diplomatic factors.
The above is Yan Ping’s statement to Chen Ruteng. Chen Ruteng, who once studied at the Department of Journalism at the Taiwan University of Political Science, told the author with emotion that the Kuomintang had ruined the future of several students. After they were repatriated, they did not continue to study. Chen Ruteng deeply regrets their situation...
From this we can see that in the past, the Kuomintang authorities’ control over freedom of speech was not only independent of nationals or foreigners (based on the ideology of Greater China, nor the foreign Chinese as foreigners, but “ overseas Chinese”). And the past, trying to control the thinking of the overseas Chinese community without any pervasiveness.
