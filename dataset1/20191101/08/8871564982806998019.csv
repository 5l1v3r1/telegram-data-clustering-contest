Keep Calm and Good Samaritan On: Suspect-stopping ‘uncle’ praised for his cool (Video)
01 Nov 2019, 08:49 by Coconuts Singapore
A seven-minute video showing an alleged thief pleading for mercy from another man who managed to pin him down has been going viral this week. 
Footage shared Tuesday on the All Singapore Stuff page has been watched nearly 200,000 times since it was posted Tuesday. It depicts an unnamed 39-year-old man suspected of stealing a pair of headphones on Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 begging for mercy from his captor. 



The man makes several attempts to escape but was pinned down by the other, older and very stoic  man. 
Giving up, the alleged thief then kneels down and kowtows, begs for leniency, at which point his human wall tells him coolly in Hokkien, “I gave you a chance but you didn’t take it.”
The suspect remained in good citizen-detention until the police came to arrest him. 
Netizens gave big cheers to the so-called “uncle” for being a Good Samaritan, and his cool and calm demeanor throughout. 
“I admire the courage of the older man. Well done uncle!” Tan Hong Boon wrote.
“This Uncle good sia, he kept him restrained without using unnecessary force. He could have given him a few punches when he attempted to escape,” Steve Pang wrote. “And I didn’t noticed this uncle swearing any vulgarity too! He had made this citizen arrest very civilised.”
“There should be more people like him. Managed situations with calm and respect not by calling names and vulgarities to the culprit. Uncle is a gentleman with right attitude and his family should be proud of him,” Neng Ayu AR wrote.
