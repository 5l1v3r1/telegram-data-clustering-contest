恐怖！港男問路 突遭港警胡椒劑噴眼（視頻）

01 Nov 2019, 08:21

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】10月31日是港警血襲太子站兩個月，同時也是萬聖節。網友當晚發起抗議活動，號召港人戴面具遊行集會。港警則如臨大敵全面戒備。期間一名男子向港警詢問警戒線在那，突遭胡椒噴霧噴眼睛。
南華早報記者Chris Lau在推特PO出一則影片顯示，一名年輕男子上前向港警詢問警戒線在那，不料想，港警竟然直接拿起手上的胡椒噴霧器，直接朝男子的眼睛噴射。
該男毫無防備之下，突遭胡椒噴霧噴眼睛，立刻捂住臉逃離，直到男子離開後，港警才放下手中的噴霧器。上述恐怖畫面被全程錄了下來，短短幾小時超過28.2萬名網友點閱，令香港市民群情激憤怒批「黑警」。



當晚，港警除了多次使用胡椒噴劑，清場過程中，還密集發射催淚彈、橡膠子彈及海綿彈。
晚6時許，港鐵太子站外已聚集數百名悼念傷亡者的示威民眾，約一小時後，防暴警察隨即發射首輪催淚彈驅離，整晚下來，港警在太子站與旺角一帶，至少發射5輪催淚彈驅散示威者。
美國之音記者8點在緊靠旺角警署於彌敦道和太子道西交叉口的牆角處，準備作電視連線，記者的同事被警方向行人道上噴洒的藍色胡椒水劑噴中，頭盔和上衣，面部和右胳膊。都有藍色水漬。
8點15分，大批防暴警突然從警署內衝出開始驅散在警署外祭奠的市民。

警方在8點半左右向警署外彌敦道往北方向的行人道上的市民和馬路上的一些示威者發射催淚彈驅散。隨後又反方向向旺角方向追趕市民和示威者。
9點以後，又有許多市民和示威者，陸續返回彌敦道和太子道西的行人道上，呼喊反送中口號，指罵警察「7.21不見人，8.31打死人」。警署內連續用擴音器廣播，要求人群散開，否則用武力驅散。
9點半左右，一些市民再陸續回到太子站外的祭奠處，燒香燒紙，悼念8月31日在太子站內被警察打死的示威者。
在維園，許多示威者頭戴習近平長相的維尼小熊面具、特首林鄭月娥面具、假面超人裝扮，以及常出現的V怪客與電影走紅的「小丑」面具，示威者行至蘭桂坊沿途，與警方爆發零星衝突。

入夜後，對抗局勢再度升級。晚間10時左右，警方又在中環蘭桂坊一帶密集施放多發催淚彈和噴灑胡椒噴霧，並迅速向四處街道推進，進行清場，但民眾持續未散，依舊在中環與上環一帶聚集，期間警方逮捕數名示威者。
至凌晨1時許，部署在旺角的警力開始撤離，而且在搭乘警用巴士離開前，再度發射多枚催淚彈。

許多市民形容8月31日晚的事件為「太子站大屠殺」、「屍殺列車」，7.21元朗黑幫無差別恐怖襲擊的翻版。目擊者则認為，8.31太子站大屠殺比7.21元朗站黑幫更黑暗、更恐怖。也是自香港反送中運動以來，最慘烈、最恐怖的一晚。
網絡上大量視頻顯示，當晚，一批防暴警察及速龍小隊成員，沖入太子站無差別瘋狂地追打年輕人，周圍的乘客驚恐地不知所措。警察恐襲過後，車廂內、月台上滿地是血，到處散亂著背包、衣物、雨傘等大量物品。
大量港民被毆打致頭破血流，還有些年輕人被毆打的雙眼泛白無生理反應，另外有數位被拍攝到的重傷者，至今不知所蹤。
期間，警察還將媒體記者和市民驅趕出地鐵站，關閉太子站祕密執法兩個多小時，之後又祕密將傷者從太子站用列車運到兩站外的荔枝角站，然後轉送醫院。但至今港鐵都不肯也不敢公開當晚太子站的視頻畫面。
醫院管理局稱，8.31當晚有46名傷者送院，送去時並無死亡個案。港警也多次否認太子站打死人。但之後的10天時間之內，香港密集出現40多起可疑自殺案件。港人強烈質疑，這是親共警方掩蓋「8.31」血案的手法。
