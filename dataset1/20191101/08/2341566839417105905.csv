（中央社倫敦31日綜合外電報導）英國下議院議長貝爾考（John Bercow）一躍成為脫歐大戰的核心人物，廣受親歐人士愛戴，今天他下台一鞠躬，結束長達10年的議長生涯。
英國國會3年多來為了辯論脫歐議題，經常激烈交鋒，場面火爆，夾在中間維持秩序的貝爾考成為爭議人物，慘遭脫歐支持者唾棄，但受到反對脫歐者讚揚。
英國下議院第157位議長、56歲的貝爾考擁有強烈個人風格，以牙尖嘴利聞名，任職期間共喊過1萬4000多次「守秩序！守秩序！」。
他的批評者罵他傲慢自負，甚至有一名議員形容他是「道貌岸然的侏儒」，但他的支持者稱讚他捍衛問責政府的後座議員權利。
德國電視新聞節目「每日新聞」（Tagesschau）將貝爾考對鬧哄哄議員大喊「守秩序」的片段剪輯成57秒短片，至今觀看次數超過137萬次，一家比利時報紙稱他是「獨一無二」。

荷蘭「人民日報」（De Volksrant）寫道：「在這些動盪不安的日子中，英國政壇唯一的秩序出自貝爾考之口。」
貝爾考昨天最後一次主持每週例行質詢首相會議時，英國兩大主要政黨領袖都向貝爾考致敬。（譯者：陳昱婷/核稿：劉學源）1081031

10 years of shouting order, 14,000 times, the British lower house speaker, Belle, retired [shadow]

(Central News Agency London 31st comprehensive foreign news report) British House of Commons Speaker John Bercow (John Bercow) became the core of the Brexit, and was widely loved by pro-European people. Today he stepped down and ended his 10-year presidential career.
For more than three years, the British Parliament has debated the issue of Brexit. It has been a fierce confrontation. The scene is hot. The Belkau, which is in the middle of maintaining order, has become a controversial figure. It has been cast aside by the Brexit supporters, but it has been praised by those who oppose the Brexit.
The 157th Speaker of the House of Commons and the 56-year-old Belkau have a strong personal style and are known for their cusp. They have called more than 14,000 ""keeping orders! Keeping order!"" during their tenure.
His critics blame him for being arrogant, and even a member of the parliament described him as a ""dwarf gnome"", but his supporters praised him for defending the rights of the government's backseat.
The German TV news program ""Tagesschau"" clips Belk's screaming ""Stop Order"" to a 57-second short film, which has been viewed more than 1.37 million times. A Belgian newspaper called him ""unique.""

The Dutch ""People's Daily"" (De Volksrant) wrote: ""In these turbulent days, the only order in British politics is from the mouth of Belkow.""
When Belkau last hosted the weekly routine questioning Prime Minister meeting yesterday, the two major political party leaders in the UK paid tribute to Belle. (Translator: Chen Yuting / Approved: Liu Xueyuan) 1081031
