習近平力推區塊鏈 專家：又一個「水變油」騙局

01 Nov 2019, 08:25

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】习近平近日大力提倡区块链，引發輿論高度關注，中國股市中與区块链相關的科技股也一度暴漲，但隨即開始暴跌。有專家對区块链火爆現象進行深度分析，指區塊鏈炒作只不過是又一個「水變油」騙局。
網際網路研發專家程墨，曾服務於摩托羅拉、微軟和雅虎，目前在美國媒體服務公司Hulu擔任架構師，他也是《深入淺出React和Redux》《深入淺出RxJS》的作者，近日他發表了《火爆的區塊鏈炒作只不過是又一個「水變油」騙局》一文，聲稱對區塊鏈進行科普，也揭穿有關區塊鏈的謊言和騙局。以下是原文：
在中國這樣一個民眾科學素養普遍低下的國家，「區塊鏈」一下子火爆了起來。據統計，A股中約有500上市公司直接或間接與區塊鏈相關，相當於A股上市公司總數的七分之一；昨天（2019年10月28日）更是扛起A股上漲的大旗，在全部150多隻漲停股票中，90%以上屬於區塊鏈概念股，其中多數是業績每況愈下、動態市盈率超過50倍以上甚至是虧損的垃圾上市公司，而且預計許多區塊鏈概念股接下來還會連續漲停，很可能創下A股市場有史以來最瘋狂的炒作記錄。
據說，許多去年申報了晶元項目各級財政補償的公司，現在正在夜以繼日地申報區塊鏈項目；除了IT、網際網路服務和通信相關企業外，許多銀行、保險、證券、金融綜合服務、地產、交運、物流、醫療、養老、超市、連鎖餐飲等傳統行業企業，都在投入巨資從區塊鏈中淘金。有人問我怎麼看待區塊鏈如此火爆的現象，我直接了當地回答：這只不過是跟當年「水變油」一樣的一個騙局而已。當年王洪成的「水變油」被眾多權威媒體捧為中國「第五大發明」，有200多位副部級以上領導現場觀摩、視察，20多萬高級知識份子通過信訪渠道上書呼籲重視這項偉大發明，可比現在的區塊鏈熱鬧得多。
許多人都知道，大約十多年前，我寫過一篇長文《想起當年我戳穿「水變油」騙局的那點事》。沒錯，我就是該文的原創作者。有人肯定會講，你或許勉強算一個化學專業人士，所以有能力判斷「水變油」是真是假。可是，區塊鏈是網際網路新技術，你一竅不通，如何下這樣草率的結論？那我們首先一起來學學區塊鏈相關的基本知識。
區塊鏈不是一個新技術，用區塊鏈技術發明的比特幣，差不多就有了10年。肯定沒人否認，比特幣應用的就是區塊鏈技術，因此，區塊鏈技術成熟於比特幣發明之前。
在網際網路新技術發明與應用日新月異的時代，區塊鏈誕生了十年，惟一得到應用的是比特幣或類似的虛擬貨幣，你看到這項技術在其他哪個領域得到廣泛應用？產生了某個或某幾個偉大的高科技公司麼？沒有，一個也沒有！這實在是因為這項技術除了用於虛擬貨幣上，用於其他領域沒有任何技術優勢。
先來給區塊鏈一個科學的定義。區塊鏈是分布式數據存儲、點對點傳輸、共識機制、加密演算法等計算機技術的新型應用模式。它本質上是一個去中心化的資料庫，是一串使用密碼學方法相關聯產生的數據塊，每一個數據塊中包含了一批次比特幣網路交易的信息，用於驗證其信息的有效性（防偽）和生成下一個區塊。
這樣的描述大約多數人看不懂，所以有技術專家打了一個比方：一個男人給自己的心愛的女人各種表白和承諾，這個女人把男人的表白和承諾分享到她的朋友圈、微博、博客和各個社交平臺，並開放給親朋好友共享，將來這個男人就沒法抵賴。這就是區塊鏈。
真正意義上的區塊鏈得包含三個要素：分布式系統（包括記賬和存儲），無法篡改的數據結構，以及共識演算法，三者互為基礎和因果，就像三體世界一樣。這看上去好厲害的樣子，可其實這是一種信息傳播極其低效，除了用於虛擬貨幣這種拿來作為洗錢和詐騙的工具應用起來比較方便，對人類目前的現實生活需求毫無價值的技術。
簡單地說，區塊鏈作為信息傳播的工具效率極其低下，因為要遍歷所有節點，只能做非常輕量級的數據應用，一旦涉及到大量的數據傳輸與更新，區塊鏈就崩了。說白了，區塊鏈其實是對存儲資源和能源的一種極大的浪費。
有人說大數據和5G技術解決了這個問題，這簡直是胡扯。大數據技術是中心化，區塊鏈是去中心化，兩者風馬牛不相及！至於5G只是解決無線傳輸速度問題，跟區塊鏈需要的存儲資源和能源消耗根本就是兩回事。就是這樣邏輯不通的低級別騙局，中國懂的人不說話，不懂的人全相信！
區塊鏈技術不是中國人發明的，而且技術成熟有了十多年時間，如果真的像「水變油」那樣帶來點石成金的經濟效益，日本和西方科技發達國家為何都不推廣應用？這些國家是沒錢，還是沒技術，或者是他們的網際網路管理比中國更嚴格，限制了這項技術的廣泛應用？
一般人根本不需要有任何科學知識，只要知道區塊鏈是一個十年前被國外發明的成熟技術，除了在虛擬貨幣上得到應用，並沒有在任何其他領域得到應用，就知道目前中國炒作的區塊鏈大規模應用，根本就是一個徹頭徹尾的騙局。
一個明顯違背科學常識人為炒作起來的騙局，導致A股七分之一的上市公司競相擁抱，其中上百家上市公司今天大概率還會連續漲停，而作為區塊鏈所謂「龍頭」的一家垃圾公司，到昨天（10月28日）已經有了連續8個漲停板，2-7個連板的區塊鏈概念股已經有幾十家，而且看來還要一直連續漲停下去，可見A股市場上的投資人是多麼不成熟、不理智。這個高額智商稅，很快會讓許多參與其中的人血本無歸。
現在回頭再來具體說說，區塊鏈技術為何可以成功應用於比特幣以及類似的虛擬貨幣，而中國無數企業聲稱的區塊鏈應用的誘人前景是徹頭徹尾的騙局。
區塊鏈所涉及的所有底層技術，不管是分布式資料庫技術，加密技術，還是點對點傳輸技術等，都是早已存在沒什麼秘密可言的成熟技術。比特幣系統最重要的特性是封閉性和自洽性，他不需要去驗證任何系統以外產生的信息的真實性，這才是區塊鏈技術能大顯身手的關鍵所在。
區塊鏈技術除了用於僅用來交易的虛擬貨幣，其他被說得天花亂墜、點石成金的廣闊應用，要麼是脫褲子放屁多此一舉，要麼就根本無法實現，無一例外全是騙人的謊言。不信，就讓我來做一個簡單的分析。
先說央行準備使用區塊鏈推出數字貨幣。在貨幣電子化如此發達，信用卡得到廣泛應用的情況下，任何一個國家貨幣的發行，早就不是依靠傳統印鈔廠印紙幣，而是各種電子化的貨幣發行。應用區塊鏈的數字貨幣，跟現在電子化的貨幣發行有什麼區別？能帶來什麼樣的好處？為何就中國央行想到了這樣的好處，全球各國央行都無動於衷？因為這根本就沒有任何一點點實用價值，跟現在常用的貨幣電子化工具相比，只會成本更高。有人故作高深地對我講，中國央行推出數字貨幣，有更深遠的謀略，那就是打破美元體繫在國際結算貨幣中的壟斷地位。這個我只能呵呵了。我們不需要費腦子，就用屁股想一想：極易管理的人民幣目前都不敢實現自由兌換，從而去挑戰美元的國際貨幣地位，還能把不好管理的數字貨幣國際化？這不是跟幾年前說開通上海石油期貨交易，就能掌控國際原油價格，並打破美國的石油-美元體系一樣幼稚可笑麼？現在哪個目標實現了？
再說媒體和上市公司宣揚的，應用區塊鏈技術，我們的出生證、房產證、婚姻證、畢業證等等都可以在區塊鏈上公證，變成全球都信任的東西，輕鬆證明「我媽是我媽」。首先，中國的出生證、房產證、婚姻證還真沒有聽說哪個國家不承認。其次，如果要將這些官方證明文件上傳網際網路，只需要成立數據中心就可以解決，數據「中心化」比區塊鏈的去中心化，無論是效率還是投資成本都少得多。最主要的是，區塊鏈的去中心化優勢在這裡完全用不上，上傳這些證件這權威渠道只能而且應當是發證機關，這樣效率最高、信息最準確，而絕對不能是個人隨意上傳，然後再一個個由發證機關來驗證。
有媒體和上市公司聲稱，採用區塊鏈技術，建立有時間戳的通用記錄存儲庫，看病換醫院不用反覆檢查，也不用為報銷醫保反覆折騰。這跟上面所說的道理一樣，只需要打通現在一個個數據孤島，就可以實現互聯共享。可是，打通一個孤島，完全不用區塊鏈技術。恰恰相反，使用區塊鏈這種效率極其低下的技術，必須建立海量的數據存儲系統，代價比現在成熟的網際網路技術高出不知道多少倍。至於看病換醫院重複檢查，根本是制度設計問題，與信息互聯互動程度根本就沒有關係，憑什麼認為區塊鏈傳送的信息，比病人及其家屬手中的紙質檢測和診斷結果更權威？因此，這樣的炒作，不是對網際網路技術常識的無知，就是存心想騙人。
有媒體和上市公司稱，利用區塊鏈技術，可知食品「前世今生「，滿足消費者對食品安全的要求。不再重複區塊鏈技術的信息存儲效率極其低效的問題，只說某個食品是否安全，它的原材料是哪裡採購來的，加工過程是怎樣的，化驗了什麼指標，各項指標是否合格，生產日期等等，都由一道道工序人工錄入的，如何保證檢測手段是科學、準確的，錄入的數據是真實、可靠的？區塊鏈能解決這些人為錄入的數據真實性麼？顯然不能。那區塊鏈技術應用又如何讓民眾吃了放心食品？因此，這還是騙。
有媒體和上市公司說，以區塊鏈技術的「交易溯源不可篡改」實現扶貧資金的「透明使用」、「精準投放」和「高效管理」。同樣道理，區塊鏈如何保證各個環節錄入的數據是真實的？當然是沒法保證。實際上，現在機動車違章系統和金稅系統，還有許多政務電子應用系統，都有分級授權管理，完全可以做到任何人無法修改，而任何修改都會留下記錄。區塊鏈在電子政務系統的應用，除了效率極其低下，體現不出任何其他的優勢。
有媒體和上市公司說，區塊鏈技術可低成本實現電子發票的不可作偽、按需開票、全程監控、數據可詢，有效打擊偷漏稅問題。這話國家稅務總局科技司的領導和開發金稅盤的航天信息公司的技術人員聽了，一定會嗤之以鼻——人家早就實現了這個功能，不但電子發票而且開具紙票發票也已經全部聯網，並可通過財務審計數據的自動比對發現企業偷稅漏稅問題。換成區塊鏈技術，除了成本翻幾倍，不但不會帶來任何一點點好處，而且能不能實現目前金稅工程的龐大功能，還要打N個問號。
總結為一句話：除非你相信中國的算盤比計算機、計算器更好使，不要相信被國外棄之不用的區塊鏈技術，可以在中國帶來點石成金的經濟效益——這正如「水變油」的想法是好的，為了趕超世界先進水平，中國也捨得不計成本去投資，但因為這個技術應用根本就是反科學的，到頭來終究是一地雞毛。
從最近半年來區塊鏈的瘋狂炒作，到網路上一邊倒地主張對未成年人犯罪同樣適用於死刑，再到無數人天天在網上公然發泄對教師、醫生和某個特定群體刻骨銘心的仇恨，堅定了我對中國國民性痛入心脾的認識：沒有任何一個民族像我們這樣反科學、反人性，而且表現特別理直氣壯，自以為是。

Xi Jinping pushes the blockchain expert: another ""water-to-oil"" scam

01 Nov 2019, 08:25

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time, November 01, 2019] Xi Jinping recently strongly advocated the blockchain, causing public concern. The technology stocks related to the blockchain in China's stock market also skyrocketed, but then began to plummet. Some experts have conducted an in-depth analysis of the blockchain hot phenomenon, saying that blockchain speculation is just another ""water-to-oil"" scam.
Internet-based R&D expert Cheng Mo, who has worked for Motorola, Microsoft and Yahoo, is currently an architect at Hulu, a US media services company. He is also the author of ""Introduction to React and Redux"" and ""Introduction to RxJS"". Recently he published ""The Hot"" Blockchain hype is just another article on ""water-to-oil"" scams, claiming that science is on the blockchain and also exposes lies and scams about blockchain. The following is the original text:
In a country like China, where the scientific literacy of the people is generally low, the ""blockchain"" has suddenly become popular. According to statistics, about 500 listed companies in the A-shares are directly or indirectly related to the blockchain, which is equivalent to one-seventh of the total number of A-share listed companies; yesterday (October 28, 2019), the A-shares rose. Daqi, in all of the more than 150 daily limit stocks, more than 90% belong to blockchain concept stocks, most of which are junk listed companies whose performance is deteriorating, their dynamic P/E ratio is more than 50 times or even loss, and many blockchain concept stocks are expected. Next, there will be a continuous daily limit, which is likely to set the record of the most insane hype in the history of the A-share market.
It is said that many companies that have applied for financial compensation at all levels of the Jingyuan project last year are now applying for blockchain projects around the clock; in addition to IT, Internet services and communications-related enterprises, many banking, insurance, securities, and financial services, Traditional industries such as real estate, transportation, logistics, medical care, pensions, supermarkets, chain catering, etc. are all investing heavily in gold mining from blockchain. Someone asked me how to think about the blockchain phenomenon so hot. I replied directly to the local: This is just a scam like the ""water to oil"". In the past, Wang Hongcheng’s “water-to-oil” was recognized as the “fifth invention” by many authoritative media. More than 200 deputy ministers and above leaders watched and inspected the scene. More than 200,000 senior intellectuals appealed to the book through letters and visits. The great invention is much more exciting than the current blockchain.
Many people know that about a decade ago, I wrote a long article ""Thinking about the scam that I smashed the ""water to oil"" scam."" That's right, I am the original author of the article. Some people will definitely say that you may be forced to count as a chemical professional, so you have the ability to judge whether water or oil is true or false. However, the blockchain is a new technology in the Internet. If you don't know anything about it, how can you make such a sloppy conclusion? Then let's first learn the basics related to the blockchain.
The blockchain is not a new technology, and bitcoin invented with blockchain technology has been around for 10 years. Certainly no one has denied that bitcoin is based on blockchain technology. Therefore, blockchain technology is mature before Bitcoin's invention.
In the era of new Internet technology inventions and applications, the blockchain has been born for ten years. The only application that has been applied to bitcoin or similar virtual currency, you see which technology is widely used in other fields? Has one or a few great high-tech companies been produced? No, no one! This is really because this technology has no technical advantage in other fields except for virtual currency.
Let's first give a scientific definition of the blockchain. Blockchain is a new application mode of computer technology such as distributed data storage, point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanism, and encryption algorithm. It is essentially a decentralized database, a collection of data blocks generated using cryptographic methods, each of which contains a batch of bitcoin network transactions for verifying its information. Validity (anti-counterfeiting) and generating the next block.
Such a description is probably not understood by most people, so a technical expert has made an analogy: a man gives his beloved woman a variety of confession and commitment, this woman shares the man's confession and commitment to her circle of friends, Weibo, Blogs and various social platforms are open to friends and family, and in the future, this man will not be able to deny it. This is the blockchain.
In the true sense, the blockchain consists of three elements: a distributed system (including accounting and storage), a data structure that cannot be tampered with, and a consensus algorithm. The three are based on each other and cause and effect, just like the three-body world. This looks very powerful, but in fact it is a kind of information communication that is extremely inefficient, except that it is more convenient to use as a tool for money laundering and fraud, and it is worthless to the current real life needs of mankind. technology.
Simply put, the blockchain as a tool for information dissemination is extremely inefficient, because it has to traverse all nodes and can only do very lightweight data applications. Once a large amount of data transmission and update is involved, the blockchain collapses. To put it bluntly, the blockchain is actually a great waste of storage resources and energy.
Some people say that big data and 5G technology solve this problem, which is simply nonsense. Big data technology is centralized, and blockchain is decentralized, and the two are irreconcilable! As for 5G, it only solves the problem of wireless transmission speed. The storage resources and energy consumption required by the blockchain are basically two different things. It is such a low-level scam that is not logical. People who know China don’t talk, people who don’t understand all believe!
Blockchain technology was not invented by the Chinese, and the technology has matured for more than a decade. If it really brings the economic benefits of “water to oil”, why do Japanese and Western technology developed countries not promote the application? ? These countries have no money, no technology, or their Internet management is stricter than China, limiting the widespread use of this technology?
The average person does not need any scientific knowledge at all. As long as he knows that the blockchain is a mature technology invented abroad by a decade ago, in addition to being applied in virtual currency and not being applied in any other field, he knows the current Chinese speculation. The large-scale application of the blockchain is simply a complete scam.
A scam that clearly contradicts the common sense of scientific common sense has led to one-seventh of A-share listed companies competing to embrace each other. Among them, hundreds of listed companies will continue to increase daily limit, and as a blockchain, the so-called ""leading"" of a garbage The company has had 8 consecutive daily limit boards until yesterday (October 28). There are dozens of blockchain concept stocks of 2-7 connected boards, and it seems that it has to continue to rise and fall continuously, showing the A-share market. How immature and irrational the investors are. This high IQ tax will soon leave many people involved in it.
Now let's go back and talk about why blockchain technology can be successfully applied to Bitcoin and similar virtual currencies, and the lucrative prospects of blockchain applications claimed by countless Chinese companies are outright scams.
All the underlying technologies involved in the blockchain, whether it is distributed database technology, encryption technology, or peer-to-peer transmission technology, are mature technologies that have no secrets. The most important feature of the Bitcoin system is its closeness and self-consistency. It does not need to verify the authenticity of the information generated outside of any system. This is the key to the blockchain technology.
In addition to the virtual currency used for trading only, blockchain technology is widely used in the vast array of applications, such as sloppy and fart, or it can not be achieved at all, without exception, it is a lie. . If you don't believe it, let me do a simple analysis.
Let me say that the central bank is ready to use the blockchain to launch digital currency. In the case that electronic money is so developed and credit cards are widely used, the issuance of any national currency has long been not based on traditional banknote printing companies, but various electronic currency issuance. What is the difference between the digital currency of the blockchain and the current electronic currency issue? What kind of benefits can it bring? Why did the central bank think of such a benefit, and the central banks around the world are indifferent? Because this does not have any practical value at all, it will only cost more than the commonly used electronic currency tools. Some people pretend to tell me profoundly that the Chinese central bank has introduced digital currency and has a far-reaching strategy, which is to break the monopoly position of the US dollar system in the international settlement currency. I can only do this. We don't have to worry about it, just think about it with the ass: the extremely manageable renminbi is not willing to realize free exchange, so as to challenge the international currency status of the dollar, and internationalize the badly managed digital currency? Isn't this just as ridiculous as it was to say that opening a Shanghai oil futures transaction a few years ago would be able to control international crude oil prices and break the US oil-dollar system? Which goal is achieved now?
Let's talk about the media and listed companies' promotion, the application of blockchain technology, our birth certificate, real estate license, marriage certificate, diploma, etc. can be notarized in the blockchain, become a global trust, easily prove ""my mother It’s my mother."" First of all, China’s birth certificate, real estate certificate, and marriage certificate have not really heard of which country does not recognize it. Secondly, if you want to upload these official documents to the Internet, you only need to set up a data center to solve them. The data “centralization” is much less than the decentralization of the blockchain, both in terms of efficiency and investment cost. The most important thing is that the decentralization advantage of the blockchain is completely useless here. The authoritative channel for uploading these documents can only be and should be the issuing authority, so that the most efficient and accurate information can not be uploaded by individuals. And then one by one by the issuing authority to verify.
Some media and listed companies claim that the use of blockchain technology, the establishment of a time-stamped general record repository, no need to repeatedly check the hospital for medical treatment, and do not have to reimburse for reimbursement of medical insurance. This is the same as the above, just need to open up the data islands now, you can achieve interconnection and sharing. However, to get through an island, there is no blockchain technology at all. Quite the contrary, the use of blockchain, an extremely inefficient technology, has to build a massive data storage system at a fraction of the cost of today's mature Internet technology. As for the repeated examinations of doctors and hospitals, it is fundamentally a system design problem. There is no relationship with the level of information interconnection. Why do you think that the information transmitted by the blockchain is more authoritative than the paper detection and diagnosis results of patients and their families? Therefore, such hype is not ignorance of the common sense of Internet technology, but is deliberately deceiving.
Some media and listed companies said that using blockchain technology, we can know that food is ""previous and modern"" and meet consumers' requirements for food safety. It is no longer necessary to repeat the problem of information storage efficiency of blockchain technology is extremely inefficient. Whether the food is safe, where is the raw material purchased, what is the processing process, what indicators have been tested, whether the indicators are qualified, the date of production, etc., are manually entered by a series of processes, how to ensure that the detection means is scientific Accurately, the data entered is true and reliable. Can the blockchain solve the authenticity of these human-entered data? Obviously not. How does the blockchain technology application allow people to eat safe food? Therefore, this is still a lie. .
Some media and listed companies said that the ""transaction traceability cannot be falsified"" by blockchain technology to achieve ""transparent use"", ""precise delivery"" and ""efficient management"" of poverty alleviation funds. By the same token, how does the blockchain ensure that the data entered in each link is true? Of course, there is no guarantee. In fact, the motor vehicle violation system and the golden tax system, as well as many government electronic application systems, have hierarchical authorization management, which can be done by anyone without modification, and any modification will leave a record. The application of the blockchain in the e-government system, in addition to the extremely low efficiency, does not show any other advantages.
Some media and listed companies said that blockchain technology can achieve low-cost electronic invoices, on-demand billing, full-time monitoring, and data inquiries, effectively combating tax evasion. In this case, the leaders of the Science and Technology Department of the State Administration of Taxation and the technical personnel of the Aerospace Information Company, which developed the Golden Taxation, will listen to it and will certainly sneer at it - people have already realized this function, not only electronic invoices but also invoices for paper tickets have been fully networked. And through the automatic comparison of financial audit data, the problem of tax evasion and tax evasion can be found. Switching to blockchain technology, in addition to cost several times, will not bring any little benefits, and can not achieve the huge functions of the current Golden Tax Project, but also hit N question marks.
Summarized in one sentence: Unless you believe that China's abacus is better than computers and calculators, don't believe that blockchain technology that has been abandoned by foreign countries can bring economic benefits to China – this is like “ The idea of ""water-to-oil"" is good. In order to catch up with the world's advanced level, China is willing to invest regardless of cost, but because this technology application is fundamentally anti-scientific, it will eventually be a feather.
From the crazy speculation of the blockchain in the last six months, to the one-sided fall on the Internet, the same applies to the crime of juvenile delinquency, and then to countless people on the Internet every day to openly vent their hatred of teachers, doctors and a particular group. It has strengthened my understanding of the Chinese nationality's painful spleen: no nation has anti-science and anti-humanity like ours, and it is particularly straightforward and self-righteous.
