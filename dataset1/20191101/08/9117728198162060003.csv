Max Verstappen worried that the 2021 cars aren't fast enough
01 Nov 2019, 08:43 by Louis Shaw

Max Verstappen is worried that the new 2021 cars will not be fast enough. It is thought that the new design will allow for closer racing but at a slower lap time. Verstappen thinks that Formula 1 has gone too far and that something in between the current cars and new design would be better. 

When Verstappen joined Formula 1 the cars had a lot more downforce which saw slower lap times but the aim was to improve the racing. 



“I didn’t really enjoy driving the cars as much back then as I do now. Of course we have to find a middle way in terms of following and stuff like that, and the cars will improve throughout the season,"" Verstappen said at a press conference in Austin.  




“But we definitely want to be within 2, 3 seconds of what we are doing now because if it’s going to be 4 or 5 it feels a bit too slow. It’s not what we want.”




Formula 1 is the pinnacle of motorsport and if the cars are to be significantly slower then it could take away from the sport. However, if the design leads to better racing then everyone will be happy.
