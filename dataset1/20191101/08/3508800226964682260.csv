印尼華僑林保華：後來才知道，曾同窗的老師學長，都是中共地下組織成員
01 Nov 2019, 08:30 by 精選書摘
革命啟蒙
在我五年級的時候，發生了我人生道路上的重大變化，也就是政治上的「早熟」。我的一位老師黃克忠借給我看美國記者埃德加・斯諾的《西行漫記》，第一次認識了中國共產黨。從此我走上「革命」道路。這些書當時在印尼還是禁書呢。後來還給我看了一部杜埃的《在呂宋平原上》。在江關生所著《中共在香港》一書中說，杜埃是八路軍香港辦事處派到菲律賓的「僑黨」，就是海外的中共地下黨員。
兩本都是歌頌共產黨的，尤其是前者對我影響很大，讓我知道中國有一個共產黨，而且是為窮人謀利益的政黨。對書中的「紅小鬼」很有興趣，因為我也是「小鬼」。先後有9個老婆的朱德會參加革命，也讓我對共產黨充滿好奇。我記得當時是在家裡躺在躺椅上看這本書。黃老師在我的紀念冊上題詞勉勵我做「小魯迅」，這對我後來從事寫作，也有某些激勵因素。可以說，他就是我的「革命啟蒙人」。他回國後改名黃阿玲。
老師為何特別垂青我？除了當時我對閱讀的愛好，更主要是我的身份，因為我的老爸是校長，老媽是老師，在那裡的華人社會有相當高的社會地位。後來當然也明白，這些是中共地下活動的一部分，以我的年紀，本來還不夠班，因為當時才9歲呢，怎麼不算是早熟呢？但是到底我年紀太小，具體情況並不明白。
幾年前，一位早已移居外國的華公學長給我寫了一封信，介紹的是他所知道的當時中共地下活動情況：
「說到把『憤青』叫做『糞青』，令在下回憶起年少時還在印尼上高小的有趣經歷。『太平洋戰爭』爆發時，原來為『荷屬東印度』殖民地的印尼，被日本軍隊占領領長達3年8個月。期間，有一位從三寶壟（Semarang，中爪哇的大城市）來的林華益兄，到我們居住的梭羅（Solo），牽頭組織秘密的讀書會團體『華僑青年學生團』（簡稱『華青』）。一些已讀初中的學兄學姐都失學，便參加讀書會的活動，作為進修；隨後我也被吸收進來。華益兄是三寶壟『華英中學』高中班的學生，該校教學品質高，並以思想進步聞名全爪哇。其校長鄭曼如老師是地下黨的領導成員，對華益兄影響頗深。當時讀書會的秘密活動地點，就在廖國宏學兄家裡。猶記年紀較大的成員有黃阿玲學兄（回國後在中央人民廣播電台對外部長期擔任印尼語組組長）、張春山兄（中僑委資深幹部）、陳永盛兄（曾任上海市委『僑辦』主任）、饒錫榮學兄（梭羅華人『愛國』社團知名領導人）、陳亞瑤學姐（曾任鐵道學院系主任）、林淑敏學姐（資深眼科醫生），還有家兄、堂兄、堂姐等。那時，大家經常在一起讀書，討論國內國際時事，還出版手抄的月刊。印象裡最早讀過的『進步』書籍，其中就有斯諾寫的那本《西行漫記》：接受『革命』思想，十分嚮往『延安』。後來，『華青』許多成員被地下黨納入『民族抗日大同盟』（簡稱『民大』），成為正式的週邊組織。六十多年前，我們在那個年代的表現，其實就很『憤青』了。」
「在日據時期大膽秘密進行這樣的抗日宣傳活動，那是十分危險的；所以家長父兄知道『蛛絲馬跡』後，便告誡不要進行如此活動，免得被日本憲兵隊破獲，不但招來殺身之禍，家屬都要受到連累。但是，我們這些自以為『革命』的一代『憤青』，天不怕，地不怕，還怕什麼『日本鬼子』；是以把前輩們的規勸都當成『耳旁風』。因此，有些大人就罵我們這幫年輕人『幼稚無知』，就會『Cia sai』（閩南話『食屎』，印尼語『makkan tahi』。實際上，就是罵我們是『糞青』。幸虧沒有人告密，也沒有被日本當局發現，平安無事，直到日本投降。當年回國，至今留在國內已經『離休』的那些學長，後來中央組織部都承認他們在日據時期的革命經歷為『抗日幹部』，補辦正式手續，提高了他們的政治待遇。」
以前我寫回憶錄片段時，盡量不把人名寫出來，以免造成相關人的不便。但是時至今日，我要把歷史留下，而相關人，包括我自己，不是已經去世，也快入土，受到的影響很有限了。所以抱歉在這裡把這些人名寫出來。
黃克忠是我的同班同學李全裕的表兄，而且住在一起，就在華公附近，大概兩百公尺的路程。李家開五金店，李父叫做李清波，在梭羅也算有社會地位。全裕後來也回國，但是很早就回到香港，再回到印尼。
1949年那年，就有好幾個我所認識的梭羅學長回國了。在中央人民廣播電台印尼語組的還有林光果，後來也回流香港。最賢、仕賢兄弟倆也是那一年或更早就回國的，他們是梭羅一間百貨公司「土庫榮茂」的少東，沒有繼承家業就回國投身革命，可見其寶貴情操。仕賢後來還參加中國人民志願軍到朝鮮作戰。想想當時這些年輕人比我還「瘋狂」。當時還有一位學長叫吳家裔（後改名志生），他參與進軍西藏，後來在馬列學院任教，再轉到廈門大學的南洋研究所（？）。
當時梭羅一家有名的華人餐館瑪琅酒家（瑪琅是東爪哇一個城市名字）少東，就是信中所說的廖國宏，也是1949年左右回到中國，不過他留在廣東，在中國旅行社工作，大約1970年代初期，派到香港，負責香港中國旅行社的工作。這是我媽當時回到中國看望我時告訴我的。廖後來派駐澳洲悉尼。
還有另一位叫梁英明，他離開梭羅後沒有回國，而是到雅加達巴城中學讀高中，然後留校任教，是我高中二的歷史課老師，我本來對歷史課就很有興趣，看不少參考書，考試成績很好，學期結束的報告單上是一百分。1955年他比我早一班船回國。他是當年巴中回國同學會會長，他推薦我做副秘書長，這是我第一次參與社會工作。梁英明才華出眾，曾經是文革小組寫作班「梁效」的一位成員，但是他加入較晚，側重政論與國際問題（《炎黃春秋》2014年6月號）。2013年，我在台北的秋水堂還買到他的新著《東南亞史》，北京人民出版社出版。那年他正好80歲。2016年華公建校九十週年，他寫了一篇「追憶華公，感念師恩」，主要篇幅寫我爸媽。他是一個傳奇人物，後面我還會提到他。
這些學長中的女性是那封信中提到的陳亞瑤，她也是很早回國，文革結束後不久回到香港，一直與我媽有來往。我們家與她在日惹姐姐亞瓊姐與姐夫尤炳利的家來往密切，我們在香港都有與他們來往。最後一次見到亞瓊姐是2015年，在香港。
這些學長的下一輩後來也因排華（中共的顛覆活動須負相當責任）而大批回國。若干年後，他們兩代人幾乎全倒流會師香港。年紀比我小的學弟、學妹，從中國回流到香港後，也常來探望後來移居香港的我媽。例如在華公附近做布匹生意的劉建義、榮姨夫婦的三位女兒。我們家與他們家成為世交。
在香港期間，阿謨給我帶來黃阿玲署名的《中國印尼關係史簡編》，1987年中國國際廣播出版社內部出版。當時中國進入改革開放時期，人們反思過去，尤其我早就覺得當年在印尼，參加中國地下黨組織的「愛（中）國「活動，簡直就是「粗暴干涉印尼內政」的罪過，但是這本書給我的感覺還停留在舊思維，例如指責當時印尼總統蘇哈托是「反動派」之類。所以雖然黃老師給了我他的名片，然而我想見面也話不投機，甚至還要接受「教育」，加上後來我被禁止進入中國，也就沒有與他見面。阿謨還帶來他的話，要我不要太貼近政治，是他的懺悔，還是因為我的政治是反共政治？
2011年，黃阿玲久病去世，我寫了「我的『革命』啟蒙人」一文。他的晚景淒涼，獨子犯法（據說涉及毒品）在獄中。我聽從學長勸告，當時沒有把這點寫進去。我不會埋怨他當年給我看《西行漫記》；即使沒有那本書，以當時我所處的環境，一樣要淪為「愛國憤青」。何況，我走什麼路，都是我自己的選擇，都由我自己負責。這是我一貫的態度。但作為我們這一代印尼華僑的「革命先輩」，晚景如此，還是令人心酸。

作者：林保華
生涯遍及五國的資深評論員，走過八十一個春夏秋冬的回憶錄。書寫「心史」與「跡史」何謂「賣國」與「愛國」如何「順民」變「刁民」印尼成長、中國學習、香港就業、美國短居、台灣入籍歷經東亞政治局勢動盪時刻，原鄉與異鄉間的輾轉奔波身分認同與人生價值的抉擇，書寫七十餘載的壯闊漂盪雖以「心史」為主，也不乏「跡史」，即可作自傳來看，也可作歷史來讀。由於作者生涯遍及印尼、香港、中國、美國到最後定根台灣，而且敢言人之不敢言，內容豐富多彩自不待言。作者披露了他的「雜種」身份，還是皇親國戚的「賣國」世家；「賣國」表達他具體化中國歷史的若干背景，「雜種」更是對傳統中國史觀的顛覆。這是一本作者由共產黨的「順民」轉變為「刁民」的歷史見證；從史的誤會走向歷史的必然。不但有上當受騙的經歷，也有覺醒反思的過程，更有追尋光明的勇氣與行動。在面對全球民主與獨裁、自由與專制大對決的關鍵時刻，作者對其一生平實的敘述與敏銳的觀察，有其可貴的價值。

Indonesian overseas Chinese Lin Baohua: I later learned that the teachers who had been with the classmates were members of the underground organization of the Communist Party of China.
01 Nov 2019, 08:30 by Featured Summary
Revolutionary enlightenment
In my fifth grade, there was a major change in my life, that is, political precocity. One of my teachers, Huang Kezhong, loaned me to see the American journalist Edgar Snow's ""Westbound Travel"" and first met the Chinese Communist Party. From then on, I embarked on the ""revolutionary"" road. These books were still banned in Indonesia at the time. Later, I showed me a Duane's ""On the Luzon Plain."" In Jiang Guansheng's book, ""The CCP in Hong Kong,"" Duane is the ""Overseas Party"" sent to the Philippines by the Eighth Route Army Hong Kong Office, which is an overseas Chinese Communist Party member.
Both of them are to praise the Communist Party. In particular, the former has a great influence on me. Let me know that China has a Communist Party and is a political party that seeks benefits for the poor. I am very interested in the ""Red Devil"" in the book because I am also a ""little ghost"". Zhu De, who has nine wives, has participated in the revolution and has made me curious about the Communist Party. I remember watching the book on the lounge chair at home. Teacher Huang’s inscription on my commemorative book encourages me to be a “Little Lu Xun”, which has some incentives for me to write later. It can be said that he is my ""revolutionary enlightenment."" After he returned to China, he changed his name to Huang Ailing.
Why is the teacher especially interested in me? In addition to my hobby of reading at the time, it was mainly my identity, because my father is the principal and the mother is the teacher. The Chinese community there has a very high social status. Later, of course, I understand that these are part of the underground activities of the CCP. At my age, I was not enough. Because I was only 9 years old, why not be precocious? But in the end I am too young, the specific situation does not understand.
A few years ago, a Huagong senior who had already moved to a foreign country wrote a letter to me about the underground activities of the CCP that he knew at the time:
""When it comes to ""angry green"" is called ""dung green"", I will recall the interesting experience of Indonesia in the next year when I was young. When the ""Pacific War"" broke out, Indonesia, originally a colony of the Dutch East India, was Japan. The army occupied the leader for 3 years and 8 months. During this period, a Lin Huayi brother from Semarang (the big city of Central Java) went to Solo, where we live, to lead a secret reading group. Overseas Chinese Youth Student Group (referred to as ""Hua Qing""). Some of the schoolmates who have studied junior high school are out of school, and they participate in the activities of the reading club as a training; then I was also absorbed. Hua Yixiong is Semarang The high school class of Yingying Middle School has a high quality teaching and is known for its ideological advancement. Its principal, Zheng Manru, is a leading member of the underground party and has a deep influence on Huayi Brothers. In the home of Liao Guohong’s brothers, the older members of the school are Huang Ailing’s brother (after returning to China, he was the head of the Indonesian language group on the Central People’s Broadcasting Station for a long time) and Zhang Chunshan’s brother (Chinese Overseas Chinese Committee) Deep cadre), Chen Yongsheng (who was the director of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office), Rao Xirong’s brother (a famous leader of the Solo Chinese patriotic society), Chen Yayao’s sister (who was the head of the Institute of Railways), and Lin Shumin’s sister (Senior ophthalmologist), as well as brothers, cousins, cousins, etc. At that time, everyone often read books together to discuss domestic and international current affairs, and also published a monthly magazine of handwriting. The first ""progress"" books read in the impression, among them There is the book ""The Westward Travel"" written by Snow: accepting the ""revolutionary"" thought, and longing for ""Yan'an"". Later, many members of ""Hua Qing"" were included in the ""National Anti-Japanese Alliance"" by the underground party (referred to as ""National University"") ), becoming a formal surrounding organization. More than 60 years ago, our performance in that era was actually very angry.""
""It is very dangerous to boldly carry out such anti-Japanese propaganda activities during the Japanese occupation period. Therefore, after the parents and brothers knew the ""spirits"", they cautioned against such activities so as not to be cracked by the Japanese gendarmerie, not only to murder, but also to murder. Family members are subject to continuous suffering. However, the generations of ""revolutionary"" that we think of as ""revolutionary"" are not afraid of the world, and we are not afraid of it. We are afraid of what ""Japanese devils""; it is to treat the predecessors' precautions as ""early winds"". Some adults will marry our young people with ""naive ignorance"" and they will be ""Cia sai"" (the 屎 话 屎 , , , , , , , , , , , 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 The whistle-blowing was not discovered by the Japanese authorities, and it was safe and sound until Japan surrendered. Those who returned to China and stayed in the country who have been retired since then, the Central Organization Department has admitted that their revolutionary experience in the Japanese occupation period was ""anti-Japanese cadres"". , to complete the formalities and improve their political treatment.""
When I wrote a memoir fragment, I tried not to write the name of the person, so as not to cause inconvenience to the person concerned. But to this day, I want to leave history, and the people involved, including myself, have not died, but are also coming into the soil, and the impact is limited. So sorry to write these names here.
Huang Kezhong is the cousin of my classmate Li Quanyu, and lives together, just around Huagong, about two hundred meters away. Li Jiakai hardware store, Li father called Li Qingbo, also has a social status in Thoreau. Quanyu later returned to China, but returned to Hong Kong very early and returned to Indonesia.
In 1949, there were several Solo scholars I knew who came back to China. In the Indonesian language group of the Central People’s Broadcasting Station, there was also Lin Guanguo, who later returned to Hong Kong. The most sage and the sage brothers returned to the country that year or earlier. They were Shaodong, a department store company in Tuluo, and they returned to China to join the revolution without inheriting their family business. This shows their precious sentiments. Shi Xian later also participated in the Chinese People's Volunteers to fight in North Korea. I think these young people were ""crazy"" than I was at the time. At that time, there was another schoolmaster named Wu Jiayuan (later renamed Zhisheng). He participated in Tibet and later taught at Marxism College and then transferred to the Nanyang Institute of Xiamen University.
At that time, a famous Chinese restaurant in Solo, Malang Restaurant (Malay is a city name in East Java), Shaodong, is the letter mentioned in the letter Liao Guohong, also returned to China around 1949, but he stayed in Guangdong, in China travel agency Work, sent to Hong Kong in the early 1970s, was responsible for the work of the Hong Kong China Travel Service. This was what my mom told me when I came back to China to visit me. Liao was later stationed in Sydney, Australia.
There is another person named Liang Yingming. After he left Solo, he did not return to China. Instead, he went to the high school in Jakarta City, and then stayed at the school. He was a high school teacher of history. I was very interested in history. Look at a lot of reference books, the test scores are very good, and the report on the end of the semester is one hundred percent. In 1955 he returned to China earlier than me. He was the president of the Alumni Association of Bazhong in the past. He recommended me to be the Deputy Secretary-General. This is my first time to participate in social work. Liang Yingming was a talented person. He was a member of the ""Liang Xiao"" writing class of the Cultural Revolution group, but he joined later, focusing on political theory and international issues (""Yanhuang Chunqiu"" June 2014 issue). In 2013, I bought his new book History of Southeast Asia at Qiushuitang in Taipei, published by Beijing People's Publishing House. That year he was exactly 80 years old. In the 90th anniversary of the establishment of Huagong in 2016, he wrote a book entitled ""Reminiscing Huagong, Missing Teacher's Grace"". The main length is written by my parents. He is a legend, and I will mention him later.
The women in these seniors are Chen Yayao mentioned in the letter. She also returned to China very early. She returned to Hong Kong shortly after the Cultural Revolution and has been dealing with my mother. Our family is close to her at Yogyakarta's sister, Yaqiong, and her brother-in-law, You Bingli. We have contacts with them in Hong Kong. The last time I saw Yaqiong was in 2015, in Hong Kong.
The next generation of these seniors also returned to China in large numbers because of the exclusion of Chinese CCP (the CCP’s subversive activities). A few years later, their two generations almost went back to Hong Kong. My younger brother and sister, who are younger than me, have come back to Hong Kong from China and often come to visit my mom who later moved to Hong Kong. For example, Liu Jianyi, who is a cloth business near Huagong, and three daughters of the Rongzheng couple. Our family has become a world with their family.
During his stay in Hong Kong, Auntie brought me the ""Compilation of History of China-Indonesia Relations"" signed by Huang Ailing, published in 1987 by China International Broadcasting Publishing House. At that time, when China entered the period of reform and opening up, people reflected on the past. In particular, I have long felt that in Indonesia, the participation in the ""Love (China)"" activities of the Chinese underground party organization was simply a sin of ""roughly interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs,"" but this book gave My feelings are still stuck in old thinking, such as accusing the Indonesian President Suharto as a ""reactionist."" So although Mr. Huang gave me his business card, I don't want to see if I want to meet, or even accept ""education."" Later, when I was banned from entering China, I didn't meet him. Auntie also brought his words, want me not to be too close to politics, is it his confession, or is it because my politics is anti-communist politics?
In 2011, Huang Ailing died of a long illness, and I wrote the article ""My ""Revolution"" Enlightenment"". His evening scene is bleak, and the only child is illegal (it is said to involve drugs) in prison. I listened to the advice of the seniors and did not write this in at the time. I will not blame him for showing me ""The Westward Journey"" in the past; even if I don't have the book, I would like to be ""patriotic and angry"" in the environment I was in at the time. What's more, what path I take is my own choice, and I am responsible for it. This is my consistent attitude. However, as the ""revolutionary ancestors"" of our generation of Indonesian overseas Chinese, the evening scene is still so sad.
