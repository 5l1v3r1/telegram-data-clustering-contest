Google gives in to pressure again and brings back Google Chrome Close Other Tab option
01 Nov 2019, 08:00 by Surur
Google has been working to simplify the menu options in the Google Chrome browser but has been getting a lot of push back every time they remove menu items.
On the last occasion, Google had to restore the removed the Close Tab To The Right option, and today a new commit on the Chromium Gerrit repository confirms that Google is also returning the Close Other Tabs option, which lets you close all the tabs except the current one.
The commit reads:
Re-add “Close Other Tabs” to tabstrip context menu.
It seems Google is fighting a losing battle against browser power users, and given that regular users probably never right-click on tabs,  we suggest the company may be better off focussing on other elements of the browser.
