從「抗英」到「流亡」：新加坡左翼地下組織的故事
01 Nov 2019, 08:30 by 潘婉明
電影《返校》由電腦遊戲改編，因結合校園、懸疑、歷史、驚悚等元素，在台灣引起很大的回響，但在新加坡及馬來西亞的華語電影圈，尚未受到關注。事實上，新馬兩地在後殖民時期及冷戰格局之下，也曾出現過相當熾熱的左翼運動，然而馬來亞共產黨（以下簡稱馬共）在戰後未及3年的1948年6月發動武裝鬥爭，組織游擊部隊深入雨林戰鬥，導致英國殖民地政府頒佈緊急狀態（Emergency, 1948-1960），全面禁止任何跟共產主義有關的組織和活動，從而迫使新馬地區的左翼團體走向地下化。
新加坡位於馬來半島最南端，與馬來亞是一衣帶水的關係。戰後英國人重返，隨即在憲政和治理上強行使兩地分離。基於政治及地理條件的限制，馬共武裝鬥爭在新加坡沒有開展的空間，惟有透過地下外圍組織對工會、學校和農村進行滲透。1948年9月，「星洲人民抗英同盟」（Singapore People’s Anti British League，以下簡稱「抗盟」）便是在這種氛圍下成立，並積極在學生、工人和青年之間廣泛吸收盟員。
「抗盟」分華語和英語兩個源流，前者以華校背景的中學生為對象，後者則鎖定當時還設址在新加坡的馬來亞大學（University of Malaya）的大學生，以及各族群的知識菁英。戰後學生普遍超齡，加上見證抗日的歷練，使中學生心智相對成熟，對政治與時局也異常關注，因此華僑中學率先於1949年初就在校園裡成立了第一個「抗盟小組」，隔年的1950年才有「抗盟英語組」（SPABL, English Speaking Section）的成立。不過據稱「英語組」成員因思慮不周延、行動不嚴密，很快就引起英國殖民地政府的注意，經過1951年1月的一場大逮捕行動以後，組織嚴重受創，形同瓦解。

相對而言，讓殖民地政府感到更棘手的其實是地下活動力和執行力強大的華校生。以華僑中學為例，「抗盟」學生組織讀書會，閱讀進步書刊和禁書，在夜裡摸進教室，將馬共星洲市委出版的《自由報》及其他革命宣傳塞入同學們的抽屜裡，又在校園的樹上懸掛五星紅旗。學生這些舉動漸漸引起殖民地政府不安，遂使有關當局加大力度對校方施壓，除了密切監視特定學生、加強巡邏校園、搜查宿舍等措施，政治部還派員到校突擊檢查和扣押學生，又勒令學校開除高二班學生數十人，繼而強制該校無限期停課，以及永久關閉寄宿生宿舍。
華僑中學經過一波整頓後獲准復課，校園表面上恢復平靜。同學們回校後也不再在教室裡發傳單、在操場上插紅旗，他們轉而專注辦活動，如籃球錦標賽、跨校野餐會、電影招待會等。華校生擅長以活動的形式進行串聯，他們在大型的野餐活動中透過演出、遊戲和歌唱來傳達信念和訊息，在電影招待會為災民籌款，以行動鼓勵青年學子關懷社會民生、投身公共事務。
然而華校生這類跨校聯繫的活動形式更不見容於殖民地政府。這導致許多活躍於校園地下活動的同學在上課時間被闖入學校的警察逮捕和監禁，許多人因非本地出生遭到遣返，另一些人則自願被驅逐出境而前往中國，那些在校園搜捕過程中及時逃走或因身份曝光不能回校的學生，從此過著四處藏匿的地下生活。換句話說，相較於用「返校」來回望台灣戒嚴時期的白色恐怖歷史，1950年代的新加坡華校生則因懷抱反殖精神、追求進步思想、參與地下組識、閱讀禁書、跨校串聯而輟學，被迫「離校」。
對華校生而言，「抗盟」是他們投身左翼政治而推開的第一柵門，裡頭充斥理想和風險。「抗盟」基於嚴密而不允許橫向發展，以免盟員在被捕或變節時牽連出其他組織關係。然而垂直、單一個人的發展形式卻嚴重限制了它的組織能動性。根據口述歷史，一個地下組織成員惟有通過考驗和試煉才有可能晉身為共產黨員，因此「抗盟」吸收盟員的程序十分繁複：首先鎖定對象，然後提供他書面閱讀材料，如《自由報》或向他介紹革命文學，使之成為「讀者」；經過觀察的「讀者」則以執行簡單的任務作為檢驗，如指派他去發傳單、貼標語或沒收身份證等，若表現沉著將被接受為盟員；在盟員階段，表現好、覺悟高者，就有可能被提拔為黨的同情者，繼而晉身為候補或預備黨員，最後轉正成為正式黨員。
然而這種貌似嚴密、審慎而耗時的招募程序，其實效益不彰，而且對「抗盟」的開展大有妨害。1950年代雖然是學生運動蓬勃的年代，但校園經過反國民服役法【註1】、中學聯【註2】等一連串學運的衝擊，反而使「抗盟」發展盟員的空間受到壓縮。與此同時，馬共的武裝部隊在1953年陸續向馬泰邊區撤出國境，在1955年的華玲會談【註3】（Baling Talks）無功而返，在1957年馬來亞獨立時幾乎失去繼續戰鬥下去的正當性，使遠在新加坡的「抗盟」作為馬共的外圍組織，面向外在局勢丕變不無徬徨。為了配合新加坡的形勢及發展更公開合法的鬥爭形式，馬共遂於1957年解散「抗盟」。
不過，「抗盟」的停擺並沒有瓦解馬共在新加坡的地下佈局，只是馬共的歷史似乎擺脫不了流亡的宿命。新加坡人民行動黨政府在1963年2月2的「冷藏行動」（Operation Cold Store）中逮捕了110名左翼分子，其中包括從行動黨分裂出來的社會主義陣線（Barisan Sosialis Singapura）人士、工會領袖、地下組織成員及共產黨員，使新加坡的泛左派陣營大受打擊。不過馬共方面基於「保（存）幹（部）」原則，早已於1953年部署了一條「秘密航道」，通過新加坡與印尼之間的小島轉運，成功將「抗盟」的重要幹部輸送到印尼首府雅加達，之後再輻射出去其他城鄉或島嶼，使他們在當地從事「上山下海」【註4】的工作，以待時機。
這支流亡隊伍散佈在印尼各地，外部環境困難，內部鬥爭也相當劇烈，其間不斷有成員掉隊、脫離和失聯。儘管如此，他們還是以最基本的組織型態維繫下來，並於1970年代分批經澳門進廣東，輾轉加入馬共在湖南的廣播電台工作，再於1980年代加入馬泰邊區的游擊隊。不過，他們之中許多人，因脫離組織下落不明，或被滯留在印尼終老，成為這場革命的孤兒。
註釋：

1954年，殖民政府頒佈「國民服役法令」（National Service Act），規定在馬來亞及新加坡出生的18到20歲男性需登記入伍。此舉引起華社反彈，華校生（特別是超齡生）以求學為由要求免役，於5月13日前往總督府請願，結果與警方暴發衝突，造成48名學生被捕，約50-60人受傷，是為「五一三事件」。是夜，超過千名學生集合在中正中學，抗議政府對學生施暴。經中華總商會居中協調，學生獲釋，而總商會也限於壓力，宣佈提前放假以解散學生。但學生於6月2日重返校園展開另一波集中，直到教育部恫言關閉學校，整個反對運動才於6月24日宣告結束。
「全國華校中學生聯合會」（Singapore Chinese Middle School Students’ Union）是學生經過「反對國民服役」（或稱「五一三事件」）後，為團結所有華校中學生而成立的自發性組織。
華玲（Baling）是位於馬來西亞半島國境最北的一個小鎮。1955年，馬共曾在這裡和獨立前的馬來亞政府代表進行談判，最後沒有達成任何協議。
所謂「上山下海」指的是上山伐木和下海捕魚。不過這支在印尼的流亡隊伍辦得最成功的事業應該是飼養業。

From ""Anti-British"" to ""Exile"": The Story of Singapore's Left-wing Underground Organization
01 Nov 2019, 08:30 by Pan Yuming
The film ""Back to School"" was adapted from computer games. Due to the combination of campus, suspense, history, and horror, it has caused great repercussions in Taiwan, but it has not received much attention in the Chinese film circles in Singapore and Malaysia. In fact, in the post-colonial period and the Cold War, there were also quite hot left-wing movements in the two places. However, the Communist Party of Malaya (hereinafter referred to as the Communist Party of Malaysia) was less than three years after the war in June 1948. Launching armed struggles and organizing guerrilla units to fight in the rainforest led to the British colonial government issuing a state of emergency (Emergency, 1948-1960), which completely banned any organization and activities related to communism, forcing the left-wing groups in the Xinma area to go underground.
Singapore is located at the southernmost tip of the Malay Peninsula and is associated with Malaya. After the war, the British returned, and then they separated the two places in constitutionalism and governance. Based on political and geographical restrictions, the armed conflict of the Communist Party of China has not carried out space in Singapore, but it has penetrated trade unions, schools and rural areas through underground peripheral organizations. In September 1948, the ""Singapore People's Anti-British League"" (hereinafter referred to as ""the League of Nations"") was established in this atmosphere and actively recruited among the students, workers and youth. .
The ""Anti-Allies"" are divided into two sources: Chinese and English. The former is aimed at high school students in the background of the Chinese school. The latter is aimed at the university students who were also located in the University of Malaya in Singapore, as well as the knowledge of various ethnic groups. English. After the war, the students were over-aged, and witnessed the anti-Japanese experience, which made the middle school students' mentality relatively mature, and also paid great attention to politics and current situation. Therefore, Huaqiao Middle School took the lead in setting up the first ""anti-meeting group"" on campus in early 1949. The establishment of the ""SPABL, English Speaking Section"" was only available in 1950. However, the members of the ""English group"" allegedly caused the attention of the British colonial government because of their unconcerned and unclear actions. After a major arrest in January 1951, the organization was seriously traumatized and disintegrated.

Relatively speaking, what makes the colonial government feel more difficult is actually the underground students and the powerful Chinese students. Take Huaqiao Middle School as an example. The ""Anti-Ministerial"" students organize reading clubs, read progressive books and banned books, touch the classroom at night, and insert the ""Freedom News"" and other revolutionary propaganda published by the Communist Party of China Municipal Committee into the drawers of the students. And hanging a five-star red flag on the tree in the campus. These behaviors of the students gradually caused the colonial government to be uneasy, and the relevant authorities intensified their efforts to exert pressure on the school. In addition to closely monitoring specific students, strengthening patrolling the campus, and searching for dormitory, the Ministry of Political Affairs also sent personnel to the school to conduct surprise inspections and seizure of students. The school was ordered to expel dozens of high school students, which in turn forced the school to suspend classes indefinitely and permanently closed the boarding dormitory.
After a wave of rectification, Huaqiao Middle School was allowed to resume classes, and the campus surface was calm. After returning to school, the students no longer sent flyers in the classroom and red flags on the playground. They turned to focus on activities such as basketball tournaments, cross-school picnics, and movie receptions. Chinese students are good at connecting in the form of activities. They convey their beliefs and messages through performances, games and singing during large-scale picnics. They raise funds for the victims at the film reception to encourage young students to care for the people and the public. .
However, the form of cross-school contact activities such as Chinese school students is even less visible to the colonial government. This led to the arrest and imprisonment of many students who were active in the underground activities of the school during school hours. Many people were repatriated for non-local births, while others were voluntarily deported to China. Those who were on campus during the raids. Students who have escaped in time or who are unable to return to school due to their identity have lived in the underground life. In other words, compared to the white horror history of Taiwan’s martial law during the “back to school” period, Singapore’s Chinese students in the 1950s embraced the anti-colonial spirit, pursued progressive thinking, participated in underground group knowledge, read banned books, and cross schools. Dropping out of school and being forced to ""leave school.""
For Chinese students, the ""anti-alliance"" is the first gate they pushed into the left-wing politics, filled with ideals and risks. The ""anti-alliance"" is based on strictness and does not allow horizontal development, so as to prevent the members from implicating other organizational relationships when they are arrested or disguised. However, the vertical, single-person form of development severely limits its organizational initiative. According to oral history, an underground organization member can only become a member of the Communist Party through trials and trials. Therefore, the process of absorbing the alliance is very complicated: first, lock the object, and then provide his written reading materials, such as ""Freedom."" The newspaper introduces him to revolutionary literature and makes it a ""reader""; the ""reader"" who observes is tested by performing simple tasks, such as assigning him to send flyers, slogans or confiscation of identity cards, etc. Being accepted as a member of the league; at the stage of allies, those who perform well and become enlightened may be promoted to be party sympathizers, and then become alternate or probationary members, and finally become official party members.
However, this seemingly rigorous, prudent and time-consuming recruitment process is actually not effective, and it has a great hindrance to the development of the ""anti-alliance"". Although the 1950s was a period of vigorous student movement, the campus was subjected to a series of student movements such as the Anti-National Service Law [Note 1] and the Middle School Union [Note 2], which in turn reduced the space for the development of the ""Anti-Minister"" development. At the same time, the armed forces of the Communist Party of China successively withdrew from the border area of Matai in 1953. In 1955, the Hualing Talks returned without success. In 1957, when Malayan became independent, almost Losing the legitimacy of continuing to fight has made the ""anti-alliance"" far away in Singapore a peripheral organization of the Communist Party of China, and it is not innocent to face the external situation. In order to cope with the situation in Singapore and develop a more open and legitimate form of struggle, the Communist Party of China dissolved the ""anti-alliance"" in 1957.
However, the ""anti-alliance"" lockout did not disintegrate the Malaysian underground layout in Singapore, but the history of the Communist Party seems to be unable to escape the fate of exile. The Singapore People’s Action Party government arrested 110 left-wingers in the Operation Cold Store on February 2, 1963, including the Socialist Front (Barisan Sosialis Singapura), the union leader, who split from the DAP. Members of the underground organization and Communist Party members have greatly affected the Pan-Left camp in Singapore. However, based on the principle of ""preserving (mainly)"", the Communist Party of China has already deployed a ""secret channel"" in 1953. Through the small island transshipment between Singapore and Indonesia, it has successfully transported important cadres of the ""Anti-Allies"" to Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, will then radiate out to other urban and rural areas or islands, so that they can work in the local area to ""go to the sea"" (Note 4), waiting for the opportunity.
This exiled team is scattered throughout Indonesia. The external environment is difficult and the internal struggles are quite fierce. During this period, members are constantly left behind, separated and lost. Despite this, they were maintained in the most basic organizational form. In the 1970s, they entered Macao in batches through Guangdong, joined the Malaysian radio station in Hunan, and joined the guerrillas in the Matai border area in the 1980s. However, many of them were orphaned by the revolution because they were unclear from the organization or were left behind in Indonesia.
Note:

In 1954, the colonial government issued the National Service Act, which requires 18- to 20-year-old men born in Malaya and Singapore to be enlisted. The move caused the Chinese community to rebound. The Chinese students (especially the over-age students) requested exemption on the grounds of seeking school. They went to the Government House on May 13 to petition. As a result, the police broke out and caused 48 students to be arrested, about 50-60 people. The injury was for the ""5:13 incident."" It was night, and more than a thousand students gathered in Zhongzheng Middle School to protest against the government’s violence against students. After the Central Chamber of Commerce in China coordinated, the students were released, and the Chamber of Commerce was also limited to pressure, announcing early holidays to dissolve the students. However, the students returned to the school on June 2 to start another wave of concentration until the Ministry of Education rumored to close the school. The entire opposition movement ended on June 24.
The ""Singapore Chinese Middle School Students Union"" is a voluntary organization established to unite all Chinese high school students after ""anti-national service"" (or ""five-three events"").
Baling is a northernmost town on the peninsula of Malaysia. In 1955, the Communist Party of Malaysia negotiated with representatives of the Malayan government before independence, and finally did not reach any agreement.
The so-called ""going up the mountain"" refers to mountain logging and fishing in the sea. However, the most successful cause of this exile team in Indonesia should be the breeding industry.
