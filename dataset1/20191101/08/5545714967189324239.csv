Nintendo provides updated Switch software sales, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe soars with over 19 million (!) sold
Next up is Smash Ultimate, which came out less than a year ago
01 Nov 2019, 08:00 by Chris Carter
Due to its recent financial results posting, Nintendo has updated its software sales totals, and the results are nothing but good news for the company.
As usual Mario Kart reigns supreme, with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe pushing over 19.01 million units to date. Arriving fairly early in the system's life cycle (April 2017) it's managed to push this far with staying power, but the more impressive figure is Smash Ultimate; it's now at 15.71 million units sold in under a year.
Next up is Mario Odyssey, which is low key barely-besting Zelda: Breath of the Wild (of course, Wii U Zelda sales aren't counted here). Another surprise: can you believe that New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe sold 4.59 million and is currently the 8th best-selling Switch game of all time? It felt like that one kind of came and went despite me picking it up and doing my ceremonial Luigi U DLC playthrough.
You can find the full list below. Note that Nintendo considers both versions of Let's Go one entry.
