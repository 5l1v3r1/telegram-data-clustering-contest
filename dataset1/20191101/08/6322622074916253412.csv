希盟：官联公司重组并非巩固首相和土团党权力
01 Nov 2019, 08:50 by Arjuna Chandran Shankar
（吉隆坡1日讯）针对一名学者指现任政府对官联公司（GLC）的重组，巩固首相敦马哈迪和土著团结党权力的说法，希望联盟今日作出反驳。
希盟秘书处今日发布文告表示：“一位智库的知名人士发表的声明称，官联公司重组是为了加强首相和土团党权力的说法，显然是误导的。”
民主与经济事务研究所（IDEAS）高级研究员Edmund Terence Gomez博士周三指出，尽管首相敦马哈迪没有正式担任财政部长，但他仍是“实质上”（de-facto）的财长，因为他掌管了主要法定机构和部门。
也是马来西大学经济与管理学院长的Gomez引述IDEAS报告指出，尽管在第14届全国大选（GE14）后不兼任财长，但马哈迪将隶属财政部的国库控股（Khazanah Nasional Bhd）和国民投资机构（PNB）转到首相署。
根据希盟秘书处的说法，大选后进行的官联公司重组涉及所有机构和所有部门。
希盟承认国库控股由财政部转到首相署，但财长机构（MoF Inc）仍是该主权财富基金的最大股东。
至于国投，希盟称该基金在2018年之间已转到首相署。
希盟秘书处还表示，公私伙伴关系小组（UKAS）和几个经济走廊机构一样，从首相署转到财政部和乡区发展部。
希盟澄清，设立经济事务部的目的是接管与经济事项相关的职能，主要是之前在国阵执行期间隶属首相署的经济策划单位（EPU）。
“原先在首相署的联邦土地发展局（FELDA），如今隶属经济事务部，以便缩小首相署的规模，同时将若干经济和财政职能与首相署分开。”
希盟指出，政府目前有56个政府机构和部门，而前朝政府有92个。
文告还指，政府成立国家施政、廉正及反贪中心（GIACC），以确保官联公司和政府关联投资公司更透明和负责。
此外，2019至2023年国家反贪计划概述22项策略和115项举措，包括针对官联公司更有效的行政和廉正提升措施。
