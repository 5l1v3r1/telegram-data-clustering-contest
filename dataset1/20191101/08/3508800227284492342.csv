一位在華文學校參加讀書會的少年，後來成了讓英國頭痛的馬共領導人

今年9月，一部由電腦遊戲劇本改編而成的電影《返校》在臺灣上映。由於故事原型涉及1949年臺灣省立基隆中學《光明報》事件，一度引起熱議。有人認為這部電影反映了「白色恐怖」的「恐怖」之所在，有人則認為作為故事原型的「光明報事件」恰恰證明對鍾浩東的逮捕處置並不冤枉云云。無論如何，《返校》作為一部電影，仍然呈現了一個歷史事實，那就是共產黨以「禁書」讀書會作為一個宣傳與「發展」工作的重要途徑。
受過中高等教育，尤其是大專教育的學生，對「讀書會」這個活動當不陌生。三五好友或學友組成小團體，挑選若干讀物事先看完，在讀書會當天由主持人為與會者做導讀，再相互提問與討論。有的讀書會是敲定主題再挑選讀物，討論的內容有一定的範圍；有的讀書會則從讀物出發，討論內容有時與讀物相距甚遠。至於讀書會的目的，有些是單純的「奇文共欣賞，疑義相與析」，有些則是藉題發揮，向與會者傳達（或灌輸）某些議程。而像後者這類帶有特定目的的「讀書會」，往往也是許多組織吸納新成員的一個重要途徑，例如中國共產黨（下文簡稱中共）。
眾所周知，成立於1921年的中國共產黨，其前身便是當時國內的幾個共產主義研究會，包括在北京大學成立的馬克思學說研究會、四川省的重慶共產主義組織等，其早期成員也以大學師生為主。1921年7月，中國共產黨舉行第一次全國代表大會，與會的13名代表中，學歷最低的鄧恩銘也有中學學歷。由是觀之，早期的中國共產黨可說是一個由高學歷「覺醒青年」組成的政治組織，直至國共合作開始後才開始走向工農群眾。
提及宣傳工作，網路世代想到的就是所謂的網路宣傳戰，稍有年紀的可能會聯想到電視廣播，上了年紀的可能會聯想到群眾演說。但對當時的有志者，尤其是共產黨來說，宣傳工作最好展開的地方其實是學校，而無論是早期的中共還是遠在南洋的馬來亞共產黨（下文簡稱馬共），基本都是以學府為基地，暗中從事革命宣傳工作。之所以如此，一方面教員或校長的身份有利於宣傳工作的展開，一方面學校可以為他們提供場地，有效地把人們集中起來「做工作」。

以馬來亞為例，隨著清廷允許華工出洋，大量華工應募前來，逐漸在馬來亞各地形成一個個大小不一的華人社群。隨著南來華工逐漸定居，社群逐漸擴大，華文教育需求也跟著增加。當時的英殖民政府已有辦學，採英文授課，華社如果想受中文教育，就必須自行解決。一開始是設立私塾，禮聘先生教授童蒙教材與傳統經典，當清末實施新式教育以後，馬來亞華社很快也出現了新式學校。由於師資等因素，這些新式學校一開始只有小學教育，日後才逐步成立中學。當學生高中畢業後，如果還需要升學，就必須負笈海外——即「回唐山」。
教育需求漸增，資源卻有限且不固定，校方所採取的方案不外兩種，亦即降低任教門檻，以及招攬南來文人。前者顧名思義便是降低教員的門檻，小學畢業即可在小學任教，以此類推。馬來西亞已故教育家沈慕羽（1913–2009）早年有一段時間便是早上以學生身份在當地的培風學校中學部上課，下午則以小學教師身份在培風小學授課。後者則是廣泛以南來文人為師，有時連非文人也前來應募，例如淮海戰役兵敗被撤職的劉峙，後來便到印尼教中文，直至1953年才返臺。
這種跡近於龍蛇混雜的教育環境，是早期南來的中共黨員從事宣傳工作的好地方。儘管英殖民政府在1920年頒佈《學校註冊法令》，開始對當時的華文學校進行大整頓，但仍無阻具有共產黨背景的教師進入學校任教。他們取得教職以後，除了在講課中不著痕跡地進行宣傳，有時也會開辦夜校，為白天需要工作的民眾上課，在掃盲的同時也傳佈共產主義思想。在某些民眾接受度較高的區域，相關活動有時甚至還會半公開化，從而得到「小延安」的稱號。
除此之外，這些老師有時也會組織讀書會，挑選一些優秀且具有革命傾向的學生，一起閱讀相關書籍並加以討論。已故馬共總書記陳平（1924–2013）便是在中學時期，與同學兼日後的老戰友應敏欽被學校老師賴來福選中，參加賴來福所召集的讀書會。讀書會中閱讀與討論的讀物，正是《西行漫記》與〈論持久戰〉。賴老師的讀書會，加上對中日戰爭的同仇敵愾，對陳、應兩人日後投身革命起了推波助瀾的作用。當日軍南侵時，陳平與應敏欽便參加了抗日軍，開始了此後近半世紀的革命生涯。
諸如此般的讀書會，在二戰以後仍然在暗中進行，由於英殖民當局與日後的馬來亞政府對革命採取鎮壓態度，這類活動並不為外人所知，也不足為外人道。而隨著馬來亞共產革命走向式微，相關活動隨之停頓或終止，也使這一類讀書會蒙上了又一層面紗。《返校》呈現的或許是對白色恐怖的批判，但若回歸歷史，這種「不自由」有時反而是對「真自由」的一種保護了。

A teenager who attended a reading club at a Chinese school later became a leader of the Communist Party of the United Kingdom.
01 Nov 2019, 08:30 by Nangong Mao Cat
In September this year, a film ""Back to School"" adapted from a computer game script was released in Taiwan. Because the story prototype involved the 1949 Taiwan Provincial Keelung Middle School ""Guangming Bao"" incident, it was once heated. Some people think that this film reflects the ""terror"" of ""white terror"". Some people think that the ""Bright Newspaper"" as the prototype of the story just proves that the arrest and handling of Zhong Haodong is not overwhelming. In any case, ""Back to School"" as a film still presents a historical fact, that is, the Communist Party's ""forbidden book"" reading club as an important way of propaganda and ""development"" work.
Students who have received secondary education, especially tertiary education, are no strangers to the ""Reading Club"" event. Three or five friends or alumni form a small group, select a number of reading materials to read in advance, and the host will guide the participants on the day of the reading session, and then ask and discuss each other. Some reading clubs are finalizing the subject and then selecting the reading materials. The content of the discussion has a certain scope; some reading clubs start from reading materials, and the discussion content is sometimes far from the reading materials. As for the purpose of the reading club, some are simply ""extraordinary appreciation, doubts and analysis"", while others are used to convey and (or instill) certain agendas to the participants. A ""book club"" with a specific purpose, such as the latter, is often an important way for many organizations to absorb new members, such as the Communist Party of China (hereinafter referred to as the CCP).
As we all know, the Communist Party of China, founded in 1921, was the predecessor of several communist research conferences at that time, including the Marxist Theory Research Society established in Peking University and the Chongqing Communist Organization in Sichuan Province. Its early members also used universities. Teachers and students are the mainstay. In July 1921, the Communist Party of China held its first national congress. Of the 13 delegates present, Deng Enming, who has the lowest academic qualification, also had a secondary education. From the point of view, the early Communist Party of China can be said to be a political organization composed of highly educated ""awakening youths"". It was not until the beginning of the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party that it began to move toward the workers and peasants.
When it comes to propaganda work, the Internet generation thinks of the so-called online propaganda warfare. A little older may associate with TV broadcasts, and older people may associate with mass speeches. But for those who are interested in the time, especially the Communist Party, the best place for propaganda work is actually the school, and both the early CCP and the Communist Party of Malaya (hereinafter referred to as the Communist Party of China) in Nanyang are basically The school is the base, secretly engaged in revolutionary propaganda work. The reason for this is that the identity of the instructor or principal is conducive to the development of the propaganda work. On the one hand, the school can provide them with a venue to effectively bring people together to ""work.""

Take Malaya as an example. As the Qing court allowed Chinese workers to go abroad, a large number of Chinese workers were recruited and gradually formed a Chinese community of varying sizes in Malaya. As the Chinese workers gradually settled in the south, the community gradually expanded and the demand for Chinese education increased. At that time, the British colonial government had already run schools and taught in English. If the Chinese community wants to be educated in Chinese, it must solve it on its own. At the beginning, a private school was set up. Mr. Chen taught the children's teaching materials and traditional classics. When the new education was implemented in the late Qing Dynasty, the Malayan Chinese Society soon appeared a new school. Due to factors such as teachers, these new schools only had primary education at the beginning, and they gradually established secondary schools in the future. When a student graduates from high school, if he still needs to go to school, he must be overseas – that is, “back to Tangshan”.
The demand for education is increasing, resources are limited and not fixed. The school has adopted two different programs, namely, lowering the threshold for teaching and recruiting scholars from the South. The former, as the name suggests, is to lower the threshold of the faculty, to teach in elementary school after graduation, and so on. In the early years, the late educator of Singapore, Shen Muyu (1913–2009), was in the morning as a student at the local high school in Peifeng School. In the afternoon, he was taught as a primary school teacher at Peifeng Primary School. The latter is widely used by the literati in the south. Sometimes even non-literati also come to apply for recruitment. For example, Liu Wei, who was dismissed from the Huaihai battle, later went to Indonesia to teach Chinese until he returned to Taiwan in 1953.
This kind of trace is close to the mixed educational environment of dragons and snakes. It is a good place for the Communist Party members in the early South to engage in propaganda work. Although the British colonial government enacted the School Registration Act in 1920 and began to reorganize the Chinese schools at that time, it still has no obstacles for teachers with a Communist background to enter the school. After they got the teaching posts, in addition to propaganda without any traces in the lectures, they sometimes opened evening classes, taught classes for people who needed work during the day, and spread communist ideas while literacy. In some areas where people are more accepting, related activities are sometimes even semi-open, resulting in the title of ""small Yanan"".
In addition, these teachers sometimes organize reading clubs, select some excellent and revolutionary students, read related books and discuss them together. The late General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Chen Ping (1924–2013), was in the middle school period, and his classmate and future comrade-in-arms Ying Minqin was selected by the school teacher Lai Laifu to participate in the reading meeting called by Lai Laifu. The reading and discussion readings in the reading club are the ""Westward Travel Notes"" and ""On the Long-Term War."" Lai’s reading club, together with the same enemy against the Sino-Japanese War, played a role in fueling Chen’s and the future’s commitment to the revolution. When the Japanese invaded the south, Chen Ping and Ying Minqin participated in the anti-Japanese army and began a revolutionary career in the past half century.
Reading clubs such as this were still undercover after World War II. Due to the repression of the revolution by the British colonial authorities and the future Malayan government, such activities are not known to outsiders and are not sufficient for outsiders. With the demise of the Malayan Communist Revolution, the related activities have ceased or terminated, which has also cast a cover for this kind of reading. ""Back to School"" may be a critique of white terror, but if it returns to history, this ""non-freedom"" is sometimes a kind of protection for ""true freedom.""
