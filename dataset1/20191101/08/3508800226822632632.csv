韓國挺港感人留言：「希望你們找回屬於自己的權利」
01 Nov 2019, 08:00 by 鍾樂偉


我們想讓你知道的是韓國國民一直也在網上就香港抗爭表態。最近，在一篇輯錄過去數個月韓國人為香港抗爭者聲援的文章，看到一段感人留言。



正如今天特區政府公佈的訪港旅客數字指出，韓國是眾多國家觀光遊客中，訪港跌幅最顯著的其中一個國家。自己也有一直跟韓國朋友聯絡，據他們說，他們對來香港旅遊卻步的主要原因，雖然是與持續不斷的示威有關，但究其因由，不少人都是擔憂警察無差別地向街上人使用武力鎮壓時，殃及池魚影響旅客的安全，才會放棄選擇來港旅遊。
韓國人尤其明白、理解，甚示多同情示威者的行動，鮮會責怪他們，而這都源於韓國電視台一直派新聞特派員親身來港，實況拍攝香港抗爭真實一面。透過那些片段，大部分韓國市民，都能判斷事件對錯，責任誰屬。
而街頭上呈現的警察濫暴畫面，有曾經歷韓國八十年代軍人獨裁階段的國民，更會聯想至親身經歷，選擇站於抗爭者一方，以理解他們。
韓國國民一直也在網上就香港抗爭表態。最近，在一篇輯錄過去數個月韓國人為香港抗爭者聲援的文章，看到一段感人留言。
留言者說到：「每當看到香港的報導，便會想起八十年代的光州，被感動之餘也因為知道有跟自己同年紀的人，竟然成為前線的抗爭者而感到極為驚嘆。希望港人盡快重新找回屬於自己擁有的權利，能夠過上和平的生活！」
希望香港能夠如這位韓國祝願者所說，成功之日將在不遠處。

South Korea is very touching: ""I hope you can find your own rights.""
01 Nov 2019, 08:00 by Zhong Lewei


What we want you to know is that Korean nationals have been on the Internet to fight against Hong Kong. Recently, I saw a touching message in an article about Koreans who have supported the Hong Kong protesters in the past few months.



As the number of visitors to Hong Kong announced by the SAR Government today, South Korea is one of the most significant visitors to many countries. I have always been in contact with Korean friends. According to them, the main reason for their lack of travel to Hong Kong is related to the ongoing demonstrations. However, many people are worried that the police will indiscriminately go to the streets. When using force to suppress, the fish and pond fish will affect the safety of passengers, and will give up the choice to visit Hong Kong.
The Koreans especially understand and understand that the actions of many sympathetic demonstrators will rarely blame them, and this is due to the fact that Korean TV stations have been sending news commissioners to come to Hong Kong personally to film Hong Kong against the real side. Through those clips, most Korean citizens can judge whether the incident is right or wrong and who is responsible.
The police scenes on the streets, the people who have experienced the dictatorship of the Korean military in the 1980s, will associate themselves with personal experience and choose to stand on the side of the protesters to understand them.
Korean nationals have also been on the Internet to protest against Hong Kong. Recently, I saw a touching message in an article about Koreans who have supported the Hong Kong protesters in the past few months.
The commenter said: ""Whenever I look at the reports in Hong Kong, I will remember Gwangju in the 1980s. I was moved and I was amazed by the fact that I knew that I had the same age as my opponent. Hong Kong people will regain their own rights as soon as possible and be able to live a peaceful life!""
I hope Hong Kong can say that the day of success will not be far away, as the Korean wisher said.
