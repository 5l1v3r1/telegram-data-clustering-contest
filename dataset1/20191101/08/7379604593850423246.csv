A record 300,000 have signed up in just 48 hours – and two thirds of them are under 35. This could prove a critical factor in an already unpredictable race.

She defended the Lib Dems pro-Remain platform and policy of revoking Article 50, saying “for some time now I have argued there should be a confirmatory referendum.” Ms Sandbach added: “I think what is being offered now in the deal is so far from what we were promised that we should go back and check that this is really what Britain wants.”

He stepped down from his Commons role yesterday after ten years as Speaker, but had already been eyeing up his next move, the Daily Mirror reports. An ITV insider told the Mirror the reported fee – which would be the largest in the hit ITV show’s history – had blown Mr Bercow’s chances of appearing.

Patrick Joseph DUGGAN3 hours agoNovember 1, 2019TRUMP BACKS BORIS DONALD Trump sensationally waded in on the first day of the election campaign yesterday. He blasted Jeremy Corbyn's vision for Britain, and demolished his most powerful attack line – his claims the NHS will be up for sale in a trade deal. Mr Trump also praised Boris Johnson as a “fantastic guy” in an interview with Brexit Party boss Nigel Farage on LBC last night. His explosive intervention came after Corbyn repeated claims Boris will sell off the NHS to the president if he gets re-elected at the December 12 general election. Boris has repeatedly said the NHS is “not for sale” in any future trade deal, and recently announcing a £200million funding boost. And Mr Trump rubbished the Labour leader's claims, telling LBC: “We wouldn’t even be involved in it, we’re trying to fix our own health service.“It’s not for us to have anything to do with your health service. We’re just talking about trade”. He also urged Mr Farage and Mr Johnson to join forced in an “unstoppable” election pact. Yesterday the PM kicked off his election campaign with a vow his Brexit deal is “oven ready” and he'll get Britain out of the EU by January. And he promised a spending splurge to revitalise Britain's “forgotten towns”. Mr Corbyn's own campaign launch hit the skids when his boast he would get Brexit done in just six months was branded “laughable”. The leftie leader has vowed to turn the clock back to 2016 by holding another referendum if he becomes PM – but dodged questions on how he would vote. And he was snapped in an awkward yet hilarious pose kissing Emily Thornberry's hand. Meanwhile the Lib Dems had a boost when they picked up their 20th MP with the defection of Tory rebel Antoinette Sandbach. Yesterday was also Speaker Bercow's official last day. He was accused of “defending the indefensible” by not taking action against his pal Keith Vaz over misconduct allegations. And that was just day one! Follow all the action from day two of the campaign here on our live blog throughout the day.
