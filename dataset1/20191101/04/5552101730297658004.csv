2019暴雪嘉年華（BlizzCon）將於台北時間11月2日凌晨於加州安那翰會議中心登場，這是暴雪一年一度最盛大的活動，將公布最新的遊戲內容以及舉辦包括《爐石戰記》《鬥陣特攻》《星海爭霸2》《魔獸世界》等電競比賽及座談、社群活動。


雖然暴雪近來因為爐石的「
聰哥事件
」而有不少負面聲浪，甚至有抗議團體表明將到BlizzCon現場伸援香港抗爭者。而記者在會場發現，開幕前一晚登場的「暗月馬戲團」販賣不少週邊商品，已經吸引不少玩家前來掃貨，出現長長的排隊人龍。

安那翰會議中心週遭晚間氣溫最低大約攝氏12、13度，但會議中心前的噴水池已經聚集許多玩家，不少人扛著大包小包的週邊商品，在為隔天登場的暴雪嘉年華「暖身」。其實當天早上九點就已經出現兌換BlizzCon入場券的排隊人龍（一張票約7000元台幣），以往買票的玩家可獲得驚喜包當作禮物，這次取而代之的是一尊魔獸25週年的紀念模型。除了提早開放的商城，傍晚登場的「暗月馬戲團」也販賣不少週邊商品，玩家入場都得經過安檢，也在會場形成一條排隊人龍。
