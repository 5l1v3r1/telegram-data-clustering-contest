前世哄人錢 今世還債毫釐不爽

01 Nov 2019, 04:17

大清年間，關南有這兩家人，一家是做買賣糧食生意的，另一家是農民，農民靠種地吃飯，剩餘的糧食賣給做生意的一家，而每次賣給這家糧時，這家總是用大秤哄騙他，時日久了便哄多了農民的糧食。
過了好多年這兩人相繼過世，一個轉世關南，一個則轉世關北。有一年關南鬧災荒，一男一女二人領著二個孩子、背著一個孩子來關北逃荒要飯，路過廣靈（山西）殷家莊時，進了一家有錢人家想要點吃的。這戶人家很富有，沒兒女，不等要飯的開口，這家老人說：你帶這三個孩子要飯不方便，能不能賣一個給我？要飯的人家正愁沒飯吃，急忙說：不用買，給點糧換一個便是。於是給了三斗米換了最小的老三。
本來這小孩三、四歲很健康的，說也怪這孩子自從進了這家的門就病的臥病不起，一直五六年也不見好，病的一天比一天厲害，大洋花了差不多跟這孩子一樣高了。這家人也是花的一點也受不了了，便火了，就罵這孩子是要債鬼，要死早點何必花你爺這麼多銀元。小孩一聽也火了，怒目圓睜說道：快了！你還差我一吊五銀元呢！
老人驚奇的問：我因何欠你的？小孩子氣憤的說：你在前世千不該萬不該用秤哄我，現在我要的只剩一吊五了。於是有錢人家的老人說：那你現在死，我用一吊五給你買一口好棺材怎樣？小孩問：不知你說話可算數？老人說「算數」，話一出口，小孩兩眼一翻已經沒氣了。
欠債要還，這世不還，來生還。

The money of the past generations is too bad for the current world.

01 Nov 2019, 04:17

During the Qing Dynasty, there were two families in Guannan. One was to buy and sell grain business, the other was a farmer. Farmers depended on farming to eat, and the rest of the food was sold to a business, and each time they sold the food, This family always used a large scale to swindle him. After a long time, he had more food for the peasants.
After many years, the two men passed away, one was reincarnation and the other was reincarnation. One year in the south of the country, two men and one woman led two children, carrying a child to go to the north to escape the meal, passing through Guangling (Shanxi) Yinjiazhuang, into a wealthy family want to order. This family is very rich, no children, waiting for the opening of the meal, the old man said: You bring these three children to eat is not convenient, can you sell one to me? The people who want to eat are not eating, and hurriedly said: You don’t have to buy it. So I gave the three buckets a change to the youngest third.
Originally, this child was very healthy at the age of three or four. He also said that the child had been sick from the door of the house. He had not been sick for five or six years. The day of illness was worse than the day, and the ocean spent almost the same time. This child is as tall. This family is also a flower that can't stand it anymore. It will be a fire. If you want to die, why should you spend so many silver dollars? The child was also a fire, and he said with anger: Fast! You still have a hang of five silver dollars!
The old man was surprised to ask: Why do I owe you? The child said with anger: You shouldn’t use the scales to slap me in the past, but now I have only one hang. Then the old man of the rich family said: Then you are dying now, how can I buy a good coffin with a hanging five? The child asks: I don't know if you can count. The old man said ""counting"", and when the words were exported, the children’s eyes were gone.
If you owe debts, this world will not return, and you will survive.
