Nintendo’s Mario Kart for mobile phones, Mario Kart Tour, will get its first taste of real-time multiplayer this December. Nintendo will run a beta test before the end of the year, the company said on Twitter, but that multiplayer test will be restricted to players who subscribe to Mario Kart Tour’s Gold Pass.
Mario Kart Tour’s Gold Pass costs $4.99 per month and grants subscribers access to the mobile karting game’s fastest speed class, 200cc, and other cosmetic rewards. Early access to multiplayer is another perk, and a way for Nintendo to keep the multiplayer pool limited for now.
Nintendo released Mario Kart Tour for Android and iOS devices in September, but the mobile game shipped without a proper multiplayer mode, a staple of the franchise. Instead, players race against computer-controlled opponents in Mario Kart Tour’s stripped-down take on the 27-year-old franchise.
Mario Kart Tour is currently in the middle of a Halloween-themed event, which includes new racers Luigi, Waluigi, and King Boo, as well as a witch costume for Rosalina, and new tracks, including Luigi’s Mansion.
