大家好，歡迎收看《新聞拍案驚奇》，我是大宇。
今天是10月31號，香港的萬聖節，並不意外地伴隨著催淚煙霧度過；在當天入夜前，從北京發出的中共第19屆四中全會的報告，給一直不平靜的香港街頭，又注入了一絲不安的氣氛。同一天，不知道當局是不是在配合四中全會有關港澳部分的公告內容，香港高等法院頒布臨時禁制令，對香港人的網上言論，開始插手管制。

Hello everyone, welcome to the ""News Surprise"", I am Daewoo.
Today is October 31st, Hong Kong's Halloween, not accidentally accompanied by tears of smoke; before the night of the day, the report of the 19th Fourth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China issued from Beijing, to the streets of Hong Kong that have been unsettled, Inject a touch of restlessness. On the same day, I do not know whether the Administration is cooperating with the announcement of the Hong Kong and Macao part of the Fourth Plenary Session. The Hong Kong High Court has issued an interim injunction to introduce controls on Hong Kong people's online speech.
