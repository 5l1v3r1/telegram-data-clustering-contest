01 Nov 2019, 04:47 by msmash
Microsoft has been slowly dismantling its MSDN and TechNet blogging platforms for the past year-plus. This week, Microsoft introduced something meant to replace the MSDN and TechNet forums: A preview of Microsoft Q&A. From a report: Microsoft officials said they are making the switch because its MSDN and TechNet forums are outdated, according to a Frequently Asked Questions page about the new Q&A site. The new Q&A experience is part of the larger docs.microsoft.com platform. It is designed to offer ""relevant and timely answers to your technical problems from a community of experts and Microsoft engineers."" The new service will allow users to follow posts, tags or people to get information; provide suggested answers as users type their questions; and the ability to bookmark content for future reference. Q&A uses the same user authentication as Microsoft Docs and Learn. Experts will earn Reputation Points for answers they provide.
