评级目标价因特许权遭调降 发马续跌
01 Nov 2019, 04:18 by Wong Swee May
（吉隆坡1日讯）发马（Pharmaniaga Bhd）今日继续遭到抛售，这是由于向政府医院分销医疗产品的特许经营权将于11月30日结束，分析员因而下修评级和目标价。
媒体引述卫生部长拿督斯里祖基菲里的话报道，将不再为医疗用品的物流和配送服务提供特许经营权，取而代之的是公开招标制度。
发马盘中一度跌10仙或4.52%，至2.11令吉。截至11时55分，报2.14令吉，共61万7600股易手。
该股昨日挫29仙或11.6%，以2.21令吉挂收。
丰隆投资银行和银河-联昌证券等研究机构下调了发马的目标价。
不过，这两家研究机构维持对发马的盈利预测，等待政府对医疗用品供应公开招标的更明朗消息。
丰隆投行将该股的“买入”评级调降至“守住”，目标价也从3.45令吉，下砍至2.14令吉。
银河-联昌证券分析员Walter Aw在报告中写道，该机构维持发马的“守住”评级，但目标价调低至2.22令吉，早前为2.50令吉，以反映特许协议不获延长的盈利风险。
他指出，发马的特许协议上一次续约是在2009年，为期10年，将于2019年11月杪届满。“这个消息对我们来说是负面惊喜。”
他说，银河-联昌证券估计，该特许协议在2018年的销售总额为11亿令吉。
丰隆投行警告，在竞争的情况下，发马的赚幅下降是不可避免的。
“尽管我们认为近期收益不会受到影响，但一旦公开招标模式落实，不确定性就会上升，这一事实不容忽视。虽然我们认为发马可以通过公开招标的方式保留服务，但随着竞争加剧，赚幅下降是不可避免的。简而言之，新模式（相比现有的特许方式）的收益清晰度降低，促使我们对估值采取更为悲观的立场。”
“当公开招标，我们相信发马将占上风，因为该公司在冷链医药物流和配送方面的专业，因而具有竞争优势。该公司在过去25年为148所政府医院和1300间城郊政府医药中心供应药品和医疗用品。”
银河-联昌证券的Aw表示，发马在拟议的公开招标制度中仍具竞争优势。
“鉴于其竞争优势，在新的公开招标制度下，该公司仍可赢得物流与配送合约的一大部分。”

The target price of the rating was lowered due to the concession.
01 Nov 2019, 04:18 by Wong Swee May
KUALA LUMPUR (April 1): Pharmaniaga Bhd continues to be sold today as the franchise for distributing medical products to government hospitals will end on November 30, and analysts will downgrade their ratings and target prices.
The media quoted Health Minister Datuk Seri Zuffiri as saying that it would no longer provide franchise for logistics and distribution services for medical supplies, instead it would be a public bidding system.
In the horse, the price fell by 10 sen or 4.52% to RM2.11. As of 11:55, it reported RM2.14, a total of 617,600 shares changed hands.
The stock fell 29 sen or 11.6% yesterday and closed at RM 2.21.
Research institutions such as Hong Leong Investment Bank and Galaxy-Lianchang Securities have lowered their target prices.
However, the two research institutes maintain their earnings forecasts for the launch of Malaysia and wait for the government to make more informed information about the public bidding for medical supplies.
Hong Leong Investment Bank lowered the ""buy"" rating of the stock to ""hold"" and the target price was also cut from RM3.45 to RM2.14.
Galaxy-Lianchang Securities analyst Walter Aw wrote in the report that the agency maintained the “hold” rating of the company, but the target price was lowered to RM2.22, earlier at RM2.50 to reflect the unexpired profit of the franchise agreement. risk.
He pointed out that the last renewal of the franchise agreement was issued in 2009 for a period of 10 years and will expire in November 2019. ""This news is a negative surprise for us.""
He said that Galaxy-Lianchang Securities estimates that the total sales of the franchise agreement in 2018 is RM1.1 billion.
Hong Leong Investment Bank warned that in the case of competition, the decline in the profit of the horse is inevitable.
“Although we believe that the recent gains will not be affected, the uncertainty will rise once the open tendering model is implemented. This fact cannot be ignored. Although we believe that Malaysia can retain services through open tendering, as competition increases The decline in earnings is inevitable. In short, the reduced clarity of the new model (compared to the existing franchise) has prompted us to take a more pessimistic stance on valuation.""
“When open tendering, we believe that Malaysia will have the upper hand because of its competitive edge in cold chain pharmaceutical logistics and distribution. The company has 148 government hospitals and 1,300 suburban government medical centers in the past 25 years. Supply medicines and medical supplies.""
Aw of Galaxy-Lianchang Securities said that the company still has a competitive advantage in the proposed open tendering system.
“Given its competitive advantage, the company can still win a large portion of logistics and distribution contracts under the new open tendering system.”
