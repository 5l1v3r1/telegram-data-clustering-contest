BRIDGEPORT, Calif. — Authorities say two women were killed while climbing an icy canyon on California's Red Slate Mountain.
The Mono County Sheriff's Office says a helicopter crew spotted the bodies Monday at an elevation of about 12,000 feet. Because of high winds and steep terrain recovery efforts were delayed until the following day.
