韓國瑜拋「政府全額補助學貸利息」　教育部：恐有套利風險

國民黨總統參選人韓國瑜昨（31日）走訪桃園再拋新政見，表示政府應協助青年將學貸利息降到最低，甚至不收任何利息，由政府來補貼，不過教育部卻認為，若全免息恐有「套利」風險。
韓國瑜昨（31日）在桃園華勳鄉親見面會上再開青年政策支票，他表示政府花再多錢投資年輕人都是值得的，政府投資年輕人就是投資未來，繼先前「大學生、碩士生出國交換一年免費」外，再拋出「政府全額補助學貸利息」，令在場民眾大聲叫好。
對此，教育部高教司長朱俊彰回應，目前有88萬人在揹學貸，政府每年投入23億元預算，如果全部補貼免息，預估要再增加16億元。除了預算問題，朱俊彰也提醒，若本來沒有需求的人也來借學貸拿去做其他投資，恐有套利風險。
朱俊彰表示，近年教育部跟銀行協調，將學貸利率從1.62％降到1.15％，若政府要補貼全利息，預算的籌措和風險評估都需謹慎思考。

The government’s investment in young people is to invest in the future, following the previous “college students and master students”.

In response, Zhu Junzhang, director of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, responded that there are currently 880,000 people who are studying loans. The government has invested 2.3 billion yuan in budget every year. If all subsidies are interest-free, it is estimated to increase by 1.6 billion yuan. In addition to the budgetary issue, Zhu Junzhang also reminded that if there is no need for people to borrow money to make other investments, there may be arbitrage risks.
Zhu Junzhang said that in recent years, the Ministry of Education has coordinated with the bank to reduce the interest rate of learning loans from 1.62% to 1.15%. If the government wants to subsidize full interest, budget financing and risk assessment should be carefully considered.
