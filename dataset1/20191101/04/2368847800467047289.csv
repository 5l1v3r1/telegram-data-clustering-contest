四中全會公報泄密？分析：習受到了問責

01 Nov 2019, 04:21

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】中共四中全會閉幕後，官方發表的公報中，鋪天蓋地歌頌其黨的領導，似乎在宣示習近平仍大權在握。但有專家分析認為，習至少在兩個問題上面臨黨內壓力。也有不多的觀察者認為，習在全會上受到了問責。
為期4天的中共第十九屆四中全會，是在中美貿易戰以及香港危機持續嚴重的背景下召開的，全會前多方觀點認為，習近平目前面臨中共黨內「左右派」都不滿的局面，四中全會將對習過去幾年的路線和政策有所問責和反思，因此，此次全會或成反習派逼習下台的務虛會。
但從四中全會公報看不到有這樣的痕跡，公報全文鋪天蓋地歌頌堅持其黨的集中統一領導，把其黨領導落實到政、軍、民、學等各個環節。公報似乎在宣示，習近平大權在握，在中共黨內地位依然非常穩固。
公報中通篇也沒有提及美中貿易戰以及中美關係惡化、經濟和形勢惡化的問題。對於外界關注的另一重大問題，即如何應對持續的「香港民眾抗爭行動」，公報有所回應。
公報中還繼續將不搭界的馬列毛思想、鄧理論、三個代表、科學發展觀、習思想共同作為指導思想，在美化中共的歷史和成就的同時，突出強調了中共國家制度和國家治理體系上的所謂優勢，比如「一黨制」，堅持「黨指揮槍」等。
時事評論員林和立表示，公報反映習大權在握，看不到他受到壓力。但習至少在兩個問題上面臨黨內壓力：一是中美關係，二是民營經濟。
林和立說，公報提及鼓勵、支持、引導非公有制經濟發展，或反映中共第二代領導人鄧小平的支持者向習施壓；此外，黨內非「習家軍」或就中美關係向習發炮，所以公報少提及中美關係，避免在受壓議題上著墨太多。

大紀元評論員周曉輝說，可以肯定公報並未如實反映會議討論的內容，外界關注的對「大題目」、「重大決策」的討論很少涉及，簡而言之，公報不過是又一篇官樣垃圾文章，謊話連篇，但即便如此，也多少可以從中看出一些端倪。
公報中的強調就是繼續堅持中共的一黨專政，絕不給中國人民自由和民主，而這背後折射的就是中共對失去政權的深深的恐懼。因為一旦採用西方式民主選舉，中共和其領導人將毫無疑問地被拋棄。
周曉輝分析，從中共四中全會前的雜音不斷，到會議期間的肅殺，再到公報透露的信息，一個明顯的結論就是，中共依舊無力應對中美貿易戰，無力應對美國的施壓，即便如此，中共依舊決心將死路走到底。
法廣說公報通篇沒有提經濟形勢惡化和中美關係惡化的問題，符合中共一貫的做法，除非中共黨內發生重大鬥爭，否則不會對領導人造成的重大惡果直接在全會上討論。
這種情況曾在毛時代發生過一次，58年大躍進，引發三年大飢餓，數千萬中國人餓死。62年召開7000人大會，當時的中共國家主席劉少奇在會上提出了承責的問題，迫使毛澤東作檢討，以退為進。這為毛發動文革打倒劉少奇埋下了伏筆。
報導說，習近平雖然不是毛澤東，中共黨內目前似乎也找不到劉少奇這樣的人物。
從這樣一種角度去看，四中全會的結果似乎意味著習近平的地位照舊穩固。但公報似乎沒強調習近平的一尊地位，習的權威似乎有所削弱。
報導引述學者分析說，整個公報強調加強其黨的領導，進一步加強一黨專政，反映這次全會主題是黨建、黨治，目前形勢下存在強大不安全感和危機等，否則在內部團結、矛盾並不尖銳的情況下，全會的主題應該是聚焦經濟。
一名中國學者對BBC表示，四中公報通篇講的也是加強黨的領導——東西南北中，黨政軍民學，黨是領導一切的。經濟上的舉措基本上沒有談——基本上是在談黨建和以黨治國。是凡出現這樣的情況，一般都是有很多事情擺不平。
不少的觀察者認為習在四中受到了問責。
作者草祭評論：公報如果沒有對現任總書記進行大肆吹捧，基本就等於是一種批評。這顯然說明習在會中受到了問責和挑戰。會前傳言常委的變動並沒出現，習的親信陳敏爾也沒成為接班人，說明習企圖進一步集權的努力失敗。
四中全會召開前，海外媒體報導，本次全會上，59歲的陳敏爾和56歲的中共國務院副總理胡春華，將調北京晉升常委，然後再向未來的接班人角色過渡。但全會公報中找不到任何痕跡。
一些了解中共政治制度的專家說，中共不可能在全會上討論重大人事，人事一般都是在中共黨代會上討論。但也有分析人士認為，中共人事問題向來很詭祕，很難以全會公報的形式披露出來，除非十分有把握，鐵板釘釘。
法廣說，四中公布沒有透露出任何這方面的信息，並不意味著不存在背後的運作，但同時也意味著高層在人事問題上可能分歧不小。
北京紅二代披露，習近平面臨來自黨內非常大的壓力，因為美中關係和香港問題搞成現在這個樣子，是明顯的失敗。失敗就要有人負責，這也給習近平帶來很大的壓力而習首先要解決眼前的難題——來自中共中央委員會的壓力。
台媒也認為，習近平的最大挑戰是黨內反對勢力。香港、台灣和美國的困難局面可慢慢拆解，但黨內反對勢力如果擺不平，習近平會有翻船的危險。

The Fourth Plenary Session was leaked? Analysis: Xi was accountable

01 Nov 2019, 04:21

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 01, 2019] After the conclusion of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party, the official communique published a singular praise to the leadership of the party. It seems that Xi Jinping is still in power. However, some experts believe that Xi is facing party pressure on at least two issues. There are also a few observers who believe that Xi was held accountable at the plenary session.
The four-day Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee was held against the background of the Sino-US trade war and the continued serious crisis in Hong Kong. Before the plenary session, many people held that Xi Jinping is currently facing a dissatisfaction with the ""left and right factions"" within the Chinese Communist Party. The Fourth Plenary Session will be accountable and reflective of the lines and policies of the past few years. Therefore, this plenary session or the anti-study school is obsessed with the retreat of stepping down.
However, there is no such trace from the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session. The full text of the communique sings in the past, insists on the centralized and unified leadership of the party, and implements its party leadership in all aspects of politics, military, people, and learning. The communique seems to be announcing that Xi Jinping is in power and is still very stable in the CCP.
Nor did the communique mention the US-China trade war and the deterioration of Sino-US relations, the deterioration of the economy and the situation. The communique responded to another major issue of concern to the outside world, namely, how to deal with the ongoing ""Hong Kong people's protests.""
The communique also continued to use the Malay Mao Thought, Deng Theory, the Three Represents, the Scientific Outlook on Development, and the Xi Thoughts as the guiding ideology. In the beautification of the history and achievements of the CCP, the CCP’s national system and national governance system were highlighted. The so-called advantages, such as the ""one-party system"", adhere to the ""party command gun"" and so on.
Current affairs commentator Lin Heli said that the communique reflected that Xi Daquan was in the grip and could not see that he was under pressure. However, Xi faces pressure within the party on at least two issues: first, Sino-US relations, and second, the private economy.
Lin Heli said that the communique mentioned encouraging, supporting and guiding the development of the non-public economy, or reflecting that the supporters of the second generation of the Chinese Communist Party leader Deng Xiaoping put pressure on Xi; in addition, the party is not a ""legal army"" or a Sino-US relationship. Shooting, so the communique rarely mentions Sino-US relations and avoids too much ink on the subject of pressure.

Epoch Times commentator Zhou Xiaohui said that it can be confirmed that the communique did not accurately reflect the content of the discussion at the meeting. The discussion of ""big problems"" and ""major decision-making"" that the outside world is concerned about rarely involves. In short, the communique is just another official. A kind of junk article, a lie, but even so, how can you see some clues.
The emphasis in the communique is to continue to adhere to the CCP's one-party dictatorship and never give the Chinese people freedom and democracy. This is reflected in the CCP's deep fear of losing power. Because once Western-style democratic elections are adopted, the CCP and its leaders will undoubtedly be abandoned.
Zhou Xiaohui analyzed that from the murmurs before the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party, to the murder during the meeting, to the information disclosed in the communique, an obvious conclusion is that the CCP is still unable to cope with the Sino-US trade war, unable to cope with the pressure from the United States, even so The CCP is still determined to take the dead end to the end.
Law Guang’s statement does not mention the deterioration of the economic situation and the deterioration of Sino-US relations. It is consistent with the CCP’s consistent practice. Unless there is a major struggle within the CCP, the major evils caused by the leaders will not be discussed directly in the plenary.
This situation happened once in the Mao era, a 58-year leap forward, causing three years of great hunger, and tens of millions of Chinese starved to death. At the meeting of 7000 people in 62 years, Liu Shaoqi, the president of the Chinese Communist Party at that time, raised the issue of responsibility at the meeting, forcing Mao Zedong to make a review and retreat. This laid down the foreshadowing of Liu Shaoqi.
The report said that although Xi Jinping is not Mao Zedong, it seems that the Chinese Communist Party cannot find such a character as Liu Shaoqi.
From such a perspective, the results of the Fourth Plenary Session seem to imply that Xi Jinping’s status is still solid. However, the communique does not seem to emphasize Xi Jinping’s status, and the authority of Xi seems to have weakened.
According to the report, the scholars stressed that the entire communique emphasizes strengthening the leadership of the party and further strengthening the one-party dictatorship. It reflects that the theme of this plenary session is party building and party governance. There is a strong sense of insecurity and crisis in the current situation. Otherwise, internal unity and contradictions are In the case of not sharp, the theme of the plenary session should be to focus on the economy.
A Chinese scholar told the BBC that the Fourth China Communiqué is also to strengthen the leadership of the party - East, West, North and South, Party, Government, Military and People's Studies, and the party is leading everything. The economic measures are basically not talked about - basically talking about party building and partying the country. In the case of such a situation, there are generally many things that are not even.
Many observers believe that Xi was accountable in the fourth.
The author's comment on the grass festival: If the communique does not tout the current general secretary, the basic is equal to a criticism. This clearly shows that Xi was held accountable and challenged in the meeting. Before the meeting, the changes in the Standing Committee did not appear. The confidant Chen Miner did not become a successor, indicating that the attempt to further centralize the power of the attempt failed.
Before the Fourth Plenary Session, overseas media reported that at the plenary session, 59-year-old Chen Miner and 56-year-old Vice Premier of the State Council Hu Chunhua will transfer Beijing to the Standing Committee and then transition to the future successor role. However, no traces were found in the plenary bulletin.
Some experts who understand the political system of the Chinese Communist Party say that it is impossible for the CCP to discuss major personnel in the plenary session. Personnel are generally discussed at the party congress of the Chinese Communist Party. However, some analysts believe that the CCP personnel issue has always been very secretive and it is difficult to disclose it in the form of a plenary bulletin, unless it is very sure.
Fa Guang said that the announcement of the Fourth China did not reveal any information in this regard. It does not mean that there is no operation behind it, but it also means that the top management may have different opinions on personnel issues.
The Beijing Red II revealed that Xi Jinping faced great pressure from the party, because the US-China relationship and the Hong Kong issue have become like this, and it is an obvious failure. Some people are responsible for the failure, which also brings a lot of pressure on Xi Jinping. The first thing to solve is the immediate problem - the pressure from the CPC Central Committee.
Taiwan media also believes that Xi Jinping’s biggest challenge is the opposition within the party. The difficult situation in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the United States can be slowly dismantled. However, if the opposition forces within the party are not flat, Xi Jinping will be in danger of overturning.
