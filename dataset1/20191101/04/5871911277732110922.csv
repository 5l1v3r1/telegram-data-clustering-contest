Look: Nationals have already damaged World Series trophy while partying
01 Nov 2019, 04:02 by TSD Staff
The Nationals won their first World Series in franchise history, and the team has sure been enjoying the 24 hours since winning Game 7 in Houston.
Washington fought back from a 2-0 deficit in the seventh inning of Wednesday’s game, coming back to score seven runs off Houston’s bullpen. They became the first-ever team to win four consecutive road games in a playoff series, a feat that may never happen again.
And they’ve been partying hard to celebrate the big win — so much so that they apparently damaged the World Series trophy. Sean Doolittle posted a photo of the trophy, and it appears a few of the flags are bent, while others are missing.



We wonder how the beer tasted.
