A reality TV star has been charged with 'extorting and assaulting' her Tinder date after luring him into a home.
Suzi Taylor, 49, was refused bail for holding the man against his will in a property in Brisbane, Australia, reports say.
She demanded the victim hand over money after he arrived at the home shortly after midnight on Wednesday, a court heard.
When he refused to give her any cash, another man reportedly walked into the room and attacked him.
