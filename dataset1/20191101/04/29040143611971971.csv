01 Nov 2019, 04:00

Dell's not wasting any time this year when it comes to Black Friday shopping. Though its ad for the major shopping holiday was just released today, there are already deals live right now to browse and even more to prepare to snag in the next few weeks as the big day approaches.
Deals worth considering
Desktop computers, laptops, essential office accessories, home theater equipment, and more are all going on sale during Dell's Black Friday sale, with select discounts available right now! That makes Dell one of the first to get in on the Black Friday festivities this year, though that doesn't mean it will have the best deals. Below we shout out a few of our favorite deals in its ad this year to keep in mind while you're shopping this month.
