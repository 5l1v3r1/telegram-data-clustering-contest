【圖輯】不只《南方四賤客》再酸習近平，《禁蒙面法》下的香港如何度過萬聖節？
01 Nov 2019, 04:08 by Abby Huang


我們想讓你知道的是昨日除了萬聖節，更適逢831太子站事發後2個月。傍晚開始大批市民聚集在太子站一帶，要求港鐵、警方清楚交代831事件，與持盾牌的警方對峙。



昨日（10月31日）是萬聖節，美國諷刺卡通《南方四賤客》（South Park，港譯《衰仔樂園》）因應扮裝傳統，在最新播出的萬聖節特輯片頭，讓劇中角色戴著中國國家領導人習近平的面具跳舞，再次挑戰北京審查底線。而昨日在香港，是港府頒布《禁蒙面法》後的第一個萬聖節，不少香港民眾戴著面具至蘭桂坊慶祝佳節，最終遭警方無差別發射催淚彈驅離。
（中央社）《南方四賤客》10月初播出的第23季第2集大肆嘲諷中國，觸及人權、內容審查等敏感議題，更以小熊維尼影射習近平，觸怒北京當局。節目遭禁播後，創作人崔帕克（Trey Parker）與麥特史東（Matt Stone）並未低頭，反而發表酸味十足的「道歉文」。


「Band in China」：三層嘲諷的反覆迴旋，《南方四賤客》經典敘事代表作


時隔近一個月，《南方四賤客》再拿中國開玩笑。美東時間30日播出的萬聖節特輯中，屎蛋（Stan）父親蘭迪（Randy Marsh）在片頭主題曲橋段戴上習近平面具跳舞。



惹毛北京當局那集，蘭迪為拓展大麻生意，將腦筋動到中國市場，沒想到因攜帶大麻入境中國而遭關押，見識到勞動、再教育等慘況，並在獄中遇到因長得像領導人而被監禁的小熊維尼。這段內容被普遍解讀為諷刺習近平與新疆再教育營。
《南方四賤客》遭中國全面封殺時，正值中共慶祝建政70週年，美國職籃NBA休士頓火箭隊總經理摩瑞（Daryl Morey）推特發文力挺香港民主抗爭而掀起風波。


火箭隊總經理「撐香港」但球星哈登卻道歉，NBA總裁：支持言論自由


《南方四賤客》創作人崔帕克與麥特史東當時仿效著眼龐大市場而向中國低頭的國際企業發文：「如同NBA，我們歡迎中國審查單位入戶、入心。我們同樣愛錢，勝過自由與民主。習（近平）一點都不像小熊維尼啦。」這篇在推特發表的「道歉文」最後寫道：「偉大的中國共產黨萬歲！祝今秋高粱大豐收！我們現在和好了吧，中國？」



《南方四賤客》最新一集再拿習近平開玩笑，顯示製播單位無意為中國政府與收視群而修改自身言論尺度。這部卡通雖遭北京當局封殺，卻受到香港示威者擁戴，部分抗爭者近期在示威活動中戴起劇中角色面具，使「南方四賤客」成為抗中符號之一。
《禁蒙面法》頒布後，香港的第一個萬聖節
昨晚是帶有變裝傳統的萬聖節，香港每逢此時都有許多民眾戴面具、畫鬼妝到蘭桂坊夜店熱烈慶祝，不過今年是港府頒布《禁蒙面法》後的第一個萬聖節，也讓這個節日更為緊張。
萬聖節當日，香港警方發表口頭警告，表示容許民眾戴面具與稍作打扮，但警方有權在公眾地方要求任何人除下面罩、蒙面物或抹去臉上彩繪，以核實身分；若不服從，有權作出拘捕。
不過禁令仍止不住民眾的參與。昨日在港島的維園，成為一場嘲諷中國國家領導人習近平與港府官員的變裝秀。有市民頭戴習近平長相的維尼小熊面具、特首林鄭月娥面具、假面超人裝扮，以及常出現的V怪客與電影走紅的「小丑」臉繪；然而，逛街至蘭桂坊。

831太子事件滿2個月，民眾要求交出真相
而昨日除了萬聖節，更適逢831太子站事發後2個月。傍晚開始大批市民聚集在太子站一帶，要求港鐵、警方清楚交代831事件，與持盾牌的警方對峙，稍後也爆發警民衝突。


【8.31衝突】警察闖港鐵車廂搜捕示威者引恐慌，63人被捕


旺角警署及太子站一帶遭到示威者堵路縱火，警方清場期間，突然衝向一批在行人路的市民，一名社工被警員用警棍打到頭破血流。
昨日也有《香港電台》記者在蘭桂坊附近採訪期間，被警員用盾牌推撞及用電筒照射。記者向警員提出質疑，其後兩度被警員噴胡椒水，需要送院治理。



《中央社》報導，昨晚中環的蘭桂坊周邊地區，是示威者與港警對峙最久的戰場。港警採發射催淚彈、噴灑胡椒噴劑等方式，將示威者往上環方向驅離，但民眾持續未散，依舊在中環與上環一帶聚集，期間警方曾逮捕數名示威者。
由於警方封鎖蘭桂坊周邊街區，管制點常出現市民或外國人與防暴警察的口角爭執場面；或許是擔心延燒成外交事件，港警對外國人相較客氣，不像對付穿黑衣的示威者或現場記者，無差別地狂噴胡椒水、提棍就打、懷疑就抓。
整晚下來，港警在太子站與旺角一帶，至少發射5輪催淚彈驅散示威者。

[Photos] Not only ""Southern Four Hackers"" but also acid Xi Jinping, how does Hong Kong spend Halloween under the ""Forbidden Mask Method""?
01 Nov 2019, 04:08 by Abby Huang


What we want you to know is yesterday, except for Halloween, which is more than two months after the 831 Prince Edward incident. In the evening, a large number of citizens gathered in the vicinity of Prince Edward Station and asked the MTR and the police to clearly explain the 831 incident and confront the police holding the shield.



Yesterday (October 31) is Halloween, the American satirical cartoon ""South Park"" (South Park, ""Day Aberdeen Paradise"") in response to the costume tradition, in the latest broadcast of the special Halloween title, let the characters wear Chinese national leader Xi Jinping’s mask danced and challenged Beijing’s bottom line again. Yesterday in Hong Kong, the first Halloween after the Hong Kong Government enacted the ""Forbidden Mask Method"", many Hong Kong people wore masks to Lan Kwai Fong to celebrate the festive season, and were eventually driven away by the police without tears.
(Central News Agency) ""Southern Four Hackers"" The second episode of the 23rd season, which was aired in early October, ridiculed China, touched on sensitive issues such as human rights and content censorship, and even shot Xi Jinping with Winnie the Pooh, angering the Beijing authorities. After the show was banned, the creators of Trey Parker and Matt Stone did not bow, but instead published a sour ""apology.""


""Band in China"": The reversal of the three layers of ridicule, the classic narrative masterpiece of ""The Southern Four Hackers""


After a lapse of nearly a month, ""Southern Four Hackers"" made another joke in China. In the Halloween specials broadcast on the 30th of the East, Stan's father, Randy Marsh, danced on the near-themed bridge.



In the episode of the Beijing authorities, Randy moved to the Chinese market to expand the marijuana business. He did not expect to be imprisoned for carrying marijuana into China. He saw labor, re-education and other misery, and he encountered problems in prison. Winnie the Pooh who was imprisoned like a leader. This content is generally interpreted as satirical Xi Jinping and Xinjiang Re-education Camp.
When the ""Southern Four Hackers"" was completely blocked by China, it was at the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. Daryl Morey, the general manager of the NBA Houston Rockets, pushed the slogan to fight against the democratic struggle in Hong Kong.


Rockets general manager ""supports Hong Kong"" but star Harden apologizes, NBA president: support freedom of speech


""Southern Four Hackers"" creators, Cui Parker and Matt Stone, wrote to the Chinese companies that bowed their heads in the eyes of the huge market: ""Like the NBA, we welcome Chinese censors to enter the home and enter the heart. We also love money, win. Freedom and democracy. Xi (nearly flat) is not like Winnie the Pooh."" This ""apology"" published on Twitter finally wrote: ""Long live the great Chinese Communist Party! I wish this autumn a high harvest! We are now and Ok, China?""



The latest episode of ""Southern Four Hackers"" is then joking with Xi Jinping, showing that the broadcasters have no intention of modifying their own speech scales for the Chinese government and audience groups. Although the cartoon was banned by the Beijing authorities, it was embraced by Hong Kong demonstrators. Some of the protesters recently wore masks in the drama during the demonstrations, making the ""Southern Four Hackers"" one of the anti-Chinese symbols.
Hong Kong’s first Halloween after the promulgation of the Masking Law
Last night was a Halloween with a dressing tradition. Every time in Hong Kong, many people wear masks and make ghost makeup to the Lan Kwai Fong Nightclub to celebrate, but this year is the first time since the Hong Kong Government issued the ""Forbidden Mask Method"". Halloween, it also makes this festival even more tense.
On the day of Halloween, the Hong Kong police issued a verbal warning that the people were allowed to wear masks and dress up slightly, but the police have the right to ask anyone in the public place to remove the mask, mask or erase the face to verify identity; if not obey Have the right to make arrests.
However, the ban still cannot stop the participation of the people. Yesterday, on Victoria Park on Hong Kong Island, it became a dress-up show that mocked Chinese national leader Xi Jinping and Hong Kong officials. Some people wear Xi Jinping's face, the Pooh bear mask, the chief executive Lin Zhengyue mask, the masked superman dress, and the often-appeared V-folk and the movie's popular ""clown"" face painting; however, shopping to Lan Kwai Fong.

The 831 Prince’s incident lasted for 2 months, and the people demanded to surrender the truth.
Yesterday, in addition to Halloween, it is more than two months after the 831 Prince Edward incident. In the evening, a large number of citizens gathered in the vicinity of Prince Edward Station and asked the MTR and the police to clearly explain the 831 incident. They confronted the police with shields and later broke out.


[8.31 Conflict] The police arrested the demonstrators in the MTR railway car and panicked, 63 people were arrested


The Mong Kok Police Station and the Prince's Station were arsoned by demonstrators. During the police clearance, the police suddenly rushed to a group of people on the footpath. A social worker was beaten by police officers with a baton.
Yesterday, there was also a reporter from Radio Television Hong Kong during the interview near Lan Kwai Fong. The police officers used shields to push and use flashlights. The reporter questioned the police officers. Afterwards, the police officers sprayed pepper water twice and needed to be sent to the hospital for treatment.



""Central News Agency"" reported that the area around Lan Kwai Fong in Central last night was the longest battlefield between demonstrators and the Hong Kong police. The Hong Kong police used tear gas bombs and sprayed pepper spray to drive the demonstrators away from the ring. However, the people continued to scatter and still gathered in Central and Sheung Wan. During the police, several demonstrators were arrested.
As the police blocked the neighborhoods around Lan Kwai Fong, there were frequent disputes between citizens or foreigners and riot police. Perhaps they were worried about the burning of diplomatic incidents. The Hong Kong police were more polite to foreigners than the demonstrators wearing black. Or on-site reporters, indiscriminately squirting pepper water, hitting the stick, and suspicion.
All night, the Hong Kong police in the Prince Edward Station and Mong Kok area, at least 5 rounds of tear gas to disperse the demonstrators.
