【現場直擊】全世界只有一只的陀飛輪三問！ROGER DUBUIS的頂級作戰策略
01 Nov 2019, 04:35 by 王偲宸Amanda Wang
在眾人的掌聲簇擁之下，品牌執行長Nicola動作俐落地站上舞台，對著台下觀眾侃侃而談介紹起新錶。少了一般活動還要透過公開翻譯的程序，單槍匹馬開始論述在氣勢上就佔了不少贏面。這幾年的ROGER DUBUIS的確養成這樣的霸氣，普及不是宗旨，頂級才是目標。


ROGER DUBUIS上海EXCESS之夜，現場投射的燈光光束彷彿是Excalibur Blacklight紫外光概念的呼應。

出發前收到ROGER DUBUIS慎重其事寄來的邀請卡，空白的紙卡一看就別有玄機，拿起盒子裡的紫外光手電筒一照，這次活動主題「excess之夜」，才在光源下現了形。雖然現場要發表什麼新錶仍然保密到家，但透過這個暗示，隱約可以猜到紫外光應該是個解鎖新錶的關鍵密碼。到了上海活動當天，終於揭曉這是為Excalibur Blacklight亞洲限定版暖身的暗示。這次活動的另外一個重點聚焦在Excalibur Spider Unique Series身上，三問加上陀飛輪的頂級複雜功能組合，全球限量一只的專賣店獨家款，也透露出品牌未來想著眼的方向。


Excalibur Blacklight鏤空自動上鍊腕錶，錶徑42mm、18K白金材質、NT$ 3,872,000（亞洲限定版，限量28只）。

這次發表的兩款新錶中，Excalibur Blacklight其實在五月底就已經推出過鏤空時計三部曲，玫瑰金、白金和鈦金屬三種材質，因應不同材質，面盤上的微型藍寶石水晶管束，在正常光的情況下，搭配的顏色也都不一樣，只有在紫外光照射的時候，它們才會呈現螢光綠的狀態。這次的亞洲限定版特別之處，在於將原本單一顏色的微型藍寶石水晶管束，加入彩虹般的彩色呈現，結合ROGER DUBUIS招牌的星辰鏤空，看起來有種夢幻般的漂浮感。


Excalibur Blacklight的展示空間，以白色織繩圈構出的區塊，紫外光間隔式的照射，也讓Excalibur Blacklight面盤上的藍寶石水晶管束展現視覺效果。

至於全球只有這一只的Excalibur Spider Unique Series，是以三問加上飛行陀飛輪的複雜功能組合，ROGER DUBUIS將近年來運用得很有心得的碳纖維材質，用在錶殼和錶圈上，根據他們的實測，碳纖維可以讓三問報時聲的傳導效果達到最大效益。另外在功能上也加入創新，像是可以確認當下報時聲是進行到小時、刻鐘、還是分鐘狀態的「鳴聲顯示器」，還有類似三問啟動保護裝置的ALL OR NOTHING等等。全世界只有這一枚的專賣店限定操作，也驗證了Unique Series獨一無二的定位。


Excalibur Spider Unique Series，ROGER DUBUIS這次採用讓報時聲更響亮的碳纖維做為材質，能指示當下報時狀態的鳴聲顯示器等功能，也是別開生面的呈現。

回頭來看這幾年ROGER DUBUIS的新款，很明顯幾乎絕大部分都出在Excalibur系列，錶款的限量支數也越來越少，像是他們今年和倍耐力、藍寶堅尼聯名，僅有一只的Excalibur One-Off是例子，這次在上海發表的Excalibur Spider Unique Series，也是全世界只有一個人能擁有的限定操作。這樣一路看下來，將其他的支線逐漸整合在單一系列、加上鎖定頂級複雜功能的聚焦，還有專賣店限定和全球唯一一枚這類的限量策略，都是更強化ROGER DUBUIS深耕頂級運動錶市場的關鍵。


這次的活動也特別為Excalibur Spider Unique Series規劃出一個展間，以牆上的吸音棉打造出錄音室氛圍，旁邊也放著耳機可以聽到三問報時聲。

品牌執行長Nicola Andreatta在專訪中也驗證了這個說法，他提到由於ROGER DUBUIS的產品一直以來都著重在頂級複雜功能，生產數量本來就稀少，所以ROGER DUBUIS向來只為認同他們品牌理念的少數客群製錶，大量販售一直都不是他們的策略，因此品牌未來也會更專攻頂級消費族群的高價位帶，入門款現階段不會是他們鎖定的範疇。

既然產品方向和品牌定位都如此明確，也不禁令人好奇，行銷策略目前除了和藍寶堅尼合作關係的鞏固之外，會不會有代言人這類的模式操作。關於這點Nicola笑了笑回答說，ROGER DUBUIS過去的確沒有出現過品牌代言人，因為對ROGER DUBUIS的客層來說，他們本身就已經是社會地位崇高的大人物了，不太需要靠代言人去引導他們的消費行為。清楚知道為什麼不用某種方式行銷，也是一種成功的行銷，ROGER DUBUIS真的開始找到他們的方向了。

[On-site direct hit] There is only one tourbillon in the world! ROGER DUBUIS's top operational strategy
01 Nov 2019, 04:35 by Wang Hao Amanda Wang
Under the crowd's applause, the CEO of the brand, Nicola, stood on the stage and introduced a new watch to the audience. Less general activities have to go through the process of public translation, and single-handedly began to discuss a lot of wins in the momentum. In the past few years, ROGER DUBUIS has developed such domineering. Popularization is not an end, and top is the goal.


ROGER DUBUIS Shanghai EXCESS night, the light beam projected on the scene seems to echo the Excalibur Blacklight concept.

Before the departure, I received the invitation card sent by ROGER DUBUIS carefully. The blank paper card will have a mystery when I look at it. I pick up the ultraviolet flashlight in the box and the theme of the event is ""excess night"". It is now shaped. Although the new table to be published on the scene is still confidential, but through this suggestion, it can be vaguely guessed that the ultraviolet light should be a key password to unlock the new watch. On the day of the Shanghai event, it was finally revealed that this was a hint for warming up the Excalibur Blacklight Asia Limited Edition. Another highlight of the event focused on the Excalibur Spider Unique Series, the three-question plus the top complex combination of the tourbillon, the exclusive limited edition of a global specialty store, also revealed the future direction of the brand.


Excalibur Blacklight automatic winding watch with diameter of 42mm, 18K white gold, NT$ 3,872,000 (Asian limited edition, limited edition of 28).

In the two new watches released this time, Excalibur Blacklight actually launched the hollow timepiece trilogy at the end of May. It is made of rose gold, white gold and titanium. According to different materials, the miniature sapphire crystal tube bundle on the dial is normal. In the case of light, the colors of the matching are also different, and only when the ultraviolet light is irradiated, they will show a fluorescent green state. What is special about this Asian limited edition is the addition of the original single-color miniature sapphire crystal tube bundle to the rainbow-like color, combined with the starry hollow of the ROGER DUBUIS sign, which looks like a dreamy floating feeling.


Excalibur Blacklight's display space, a block of white woven rope loops, and UV-split illumination also give the sapphire crystal tube bundle on the Excalibur Blacklight panel a visual effect.

As for the only Excalibur Spider Unique Series in the world, it is a complex combination of three questions and flying tourbillons. ROGER DUBUIS has used carbon fiber materials that have been used in recent years for the case and bezel. The actual measurement, carbon fiber can make the maximum effect of the three-question sound transmission effect. In addition, innovations are added to the function, such as the ""sound display"" that can be confirmed when the time is reported to the hour, the quarter clock, or the minute state, as well as the ALL OR NOTHING similar to the three-question start protection device. Only one of the world's specialty stores has limited operations and verified the unique positioning of the Unique Series.


Excalibur Spider Unique Series, ROGER DUBUIS this time uses a carbon fiber that makes the sound of the time to be louder as a material, which can indicate the function of the sound display in the current state of time, and it is also a presentation.

Looking back at the new ROGER DUBUIS in recent years, it is obvious that almost all of them are in the Excalibur series. The limited number of watches is also less and less, like they have a joint name with Pirelli and Lamborghini this year. The Excalibur One-Off is just an example. The Excalibur Spider Unique Series, which was released in Shanghai this time, is also a limited operation that only one person in the world can have. In this way, the other branches will be gradually integrated into a single series, with the focus on locking the top complex functions, as well as the limited store and the only limited strategy in the world, which is to strengthen the ROGER DUBUIS. The key to the table market.


This event also specially designed an exhibition room for the Excalibur Spider Unique Series. The sound-absorbing cotton on the wall creates a studio atmosphere, and the headphones can be heard by the headphones.

Brand CEO Nicola Andreatta also verified this in an interview. He mentioned that since ROGER DUBUIS products have always focused on top complex functions, the production quantity is inherently rare, so ROGER DUBUIS has always been only a few customers who agree with their brand concept. Group watchmaking, mass sales have not been their strategy, so the brand will be more specialized in the high-priced band of the top consumer groups in the future, the entry level will not be the scope of their entry.


ROGER DUBUIS CEO Nicola Andreatta and the Chinese male star Dou Yu who participated in the Shanghai event. Although there is no brand spokesperson's strategy, the brand's friends of regional activities are also full of grounded operations.

Since the product direction and brand positioning are so clear, it is also curious to know that the marketing strategy will not have a mode operation like the spokesperson except for the consolidation of the cooperation relationship with Sapphire. On this point, Nicola smiled and replied that ROGER DUBUIS did not have a brand spokesperson in the past, because for the customer layer of ROGER DUBUIS, they themselves are already the lofty figures of social status, and it is not necessary to rely on spokesperson to guide them. consuming behavior. Knowing clearly why not marketing in a certain way is also a successful marketing, ROGER DUBUIS really began to find their direction.
