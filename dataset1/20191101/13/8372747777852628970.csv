LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- A Port Charlotte man will spend 10 years in prison for a deadly hit-and-run crash from 2016.
In November 2016, Ronald Bray was driving recklessly in the southbound lanes of Interstate 75 at mile marker 135. That's the Colonial Boulevard exit.
Bray swerved into the path of Brooke Fenton , causing her to swerve off the road and crash into a parked tractor trailer parked at the shoulder.
Bray then took off.
He was convicted for vehicular homicide, leaving the scene involving death, and reckless driving.
He will also serve five years of probation and pay restitution to Fenton's family. He must also do 100 hours of community service at a trauma center or a facility that deals with victims of car crashes.
