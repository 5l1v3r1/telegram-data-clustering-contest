Trent Alexander-Arnold has named Marcus Rashford his hardest opponent, saying he underestimated the Manchester United forward.
The Liverpool right-back is widely considered to be one of the best defenders in the world, and has demonstrated his class on a world stage, notably against Barcelona .
Manchester United away is the biggest game of Liverpool's domestic season, and in March 2018 Alexander-Arnold made up a Reds back four at Old Trafford.
But the defender quickly found himself up against it, with Rashford netting twice and getting the better of the young England international.
Looking back on the fixture, which United won 2-1, Alexander-Arnold has labelled his exchange with Rashford his toughest to date.

Alexander-Arnold told The Athletic: ""Yeah, the toughest in terms of a direct opponent and someone getting on top of me in professional football.
""I'd say I underestimated him. It was a massive learning curve for me.

""It was something that I hated happening.
""As a Liverpool player it's probably the worst game of the season to perform like that. But when things like that happen you have to learn from them.""
