01 Nov 2019, 13:18 by EndPlay
BOSTON (AP) - High winds and rains on Halloween night knocked out power to tens of thousands of customers, brought down trees and forced some school districts across southern New England to cancel classes.
Although winds were subsiding and skies were clearing Friday, Connecticut's two major electric utilities were still reporting about 80,000 customers without power.
In Rhode Island, National Grid was reporting about 35,000 customers without power.
National Grid and Eversource combined say they had about 25,000 customers without electricity in Massachusetts.
Many schools in Rhode Island were without power, forcing administrators to cancel classes for the day. Other school districts had delayed openings.
The National Weather Service reported a wind gust of 59 mph at T.F. Green Airport, Warwick, Rhode Island on Friday, and several gusts of more than 60 mph in Massachusetts.
