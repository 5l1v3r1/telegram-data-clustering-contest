Arsenal v Wolves: match preview
01 Nov 2019, 13:12 by Guardian Staff
Unai Emery’s team selection will be under scrutiny against Wolves. Will Mesut Özil start after showing his worth against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup? It feels like a no-brainer. Emery’s side have been crying out for his ability to create something from nothing to feed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette. One decision that has been made is that Granit Xhaka will play no part in proceedings. Nuno Espírito Santo will hope the drama in north London continues so his side can go for six unbeaten after a rocky start. Graham Searles
