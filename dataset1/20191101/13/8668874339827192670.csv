Another Premiership player allowed to skip a match to watch a brother in the RWC final
01 Nov 2019, 13:11 by Josh Raisey
Marcus Watson has flown out to Japan to watch his brother Anthony play for England in the World Cup final on Saturday against South Africa after another successful social media campaign.
Following on from the success of the #GetBenToJapan campaign for Sale Sharks’ Ben Curry to go and watch his twin Tom, another hashtag #WatsonToWorldCup built momentum for Wasps’ Watson and he will now also be in Yokohama.
The Olympic sevens silver medalist took to Twitter to thank both Wasps and Dai Young for letting him go as it will mean he will miss his club’s Gallagher Premiership visit from Bath on Saturday.



Meanwhile, Ben Youngs’ brother, former England international Tom, ruled out the possibility of going to Japan, claiming on Twitter that he “has a job to do this weekend here in Leicester”.
The Tigers sit at the bottom of the Premiership following two defeats. They host Gloucester on Saturday and their captain will be playing. He sent this message on social media.



Anthony Watson s starting on the wing against the Springboks, while World Rugby player of the year nominee Tom Curry will be starting at blindside flanker.
With Eddie Jones’ side entering the match as favourites, this was surely an opportunity that the likes of Marcus Watson and Ben Curry could not turn down. Wasps and Sale – to their credit – seem to have understood that.
