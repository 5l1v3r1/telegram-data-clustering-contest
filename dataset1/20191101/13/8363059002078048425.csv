Apple TV+ is Available Now With a 7-Day Free Trial
01 Nov 2019, 13:30 by Gavin Whenman
The long-awaited Apple TV+ is finally here and you can grab it for a seven-day trial absolutely free.
The new video streaming service launched today in 100 countries, including the UK, and it can be accessed on an iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV or any other supporting device with the Apple TV app installed, such as Amazon's Fire TV devices and most Rokus.
After the week-long trial ends, it will cost UK viewers £4.99 a month to keep, although there are only eight TV series and two movies available on the service at the moment and three of the series are for kids. Unlike the upcoming Disney+, Apple doesn't have a huge library of content, or indeed any pre-existing library of content, to pour into the service. If you were lucky enough to purchase a new Apple device after 10th September you're eligible for a whole year's worth of Apple TV+ for free.
The Morning Show starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Steve Carell is the launch title that has been getting the headlines, although critical responses have been mixed, with the gorgeous-looking For All Mankind from Battlestar Galactica's Ronald D Moore, an alternate-history sci-fi drama in which the space race never ended, drawing warmer reviews.
The service is Apple's attempt to compete with the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ and, no giggling at the back, BBC iPlayer and you can sign up, as well as find out more, on the Apple TV+ website.
