01 Nov 2019, 13:02 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, 中央通訊社
（中央社記者梁珮綺台北1日電）台北市勞動局領先全國，今天公告「台北市外送平台業者管理自治條例（草案）」，外送平台業者應替外送員投保意外險、颱風天應停止外送、發生職災應通報勞動檢查機關等，僱傭或承攬皆適用。
美食平台外送員車禍頻傳，勞動權益沒保障，台北市長柯文哲日前在市議會允諾成立「外送員權益保護專案小組」，勞動局今天召開「台北市外送平台業者管理自治條例（草案）」記者會，公告草案內容，預計11月底送台北市議會審議。
勞動局長賴香伶表示，自治條例共有15條，雖無法面面俱到，但台北市願意率先面對問題，盼中央政府與其他縣市也訂定法則形成保護網；勞動局職業安全衛生科長康水順說，自治條例主要是補足現有法規不足部分。
他舉例，以業者未於8小時內通報職災為例，若依職業安全法最高可罰新台幣30萬元；若依自治條例最高罰10萬元，當業者同時違反自治條例與職安法時，將優先使用罰則較重的法律。
而自治條例除強制業者為外送員投保一定額度的意外險、颱風天應停止外送、發生職災應通報勞動檢查機關外，也囊括食品安全、交通安全與消費爭議。如相關資料保存、備查、落實食安衛生管理、對新加入外送員進行教育訓練、應於平台明確揭示商品價格、取消訂單退費機制等，並明定違反規定罰責。
康水順補充，颱風天應停止上班，所以業者有責評估外送員在颱風天外送的風險，若外送員在颱風天外送且死亡，依自治條例可罰3至9萬元。
賴香伶表示，6大外送平台在台北市都有設公司或事務所，上網登記為外送員者，雙北市共有3萬5000人，而自治條例不僅讓執法機關有法的依據，也擴大對外送員的保護。（編輯：方沛清）1081101
