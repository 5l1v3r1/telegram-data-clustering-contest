Asilimia, a Kenyan technological startup, will on  Thursday, November 7 be among top ten startups from around Africa that will be showcasing their solutions to some of the biggest challenges affecting the continent at the Startupbootcamp (SBC) AfriTech 2019 Demo Day.
Asilimia makes mobile money cheaper and easier to use for informal traders whilst rechanneling the transaction fees saved into critical services and products they couldn’t previously afford and access such as insurance.
Other startups showing off their solutions, which span financial services, retail, agriculture, property, big data, commerce and more, include:

Cinnamon Clubs (Uganda) is helping the treasurers of savings and investment clubs to automate the bookkeeping of the transactions from members to and from the club. Additionally, Cinnamon Clubs offers a distribution channel for financial service providers to offer value-added services to the savings clubs.
Curacel Systems (Nigeria) is the first health claims switch in Nigeria. Powered by an AI fraud detection solution that increases the efficiency of processing claims, it digitalises claims at hospitals and sends them directly to the health insurer. Curacel saves companies up to 15% of erroneous and fraudulent claims.
Databotics(South Africa) opens up the power of robotic process automation to the SME market. From automating lead generation to submitting tax, DataBotics is able to remove mundane and repetitive administrative tasks that plague almost any company across every industry.

Survey54 (United Kingdom) is a survey intelligence platform making market research easier within Africa and emerging markets.
Yobante Express (Senegal) is a web and mobile platform that connects e-commerce retailers, businesses and individuals with independent and casual couriers, that will handle deliveries from point to point.

YouFarm (Zimbabwe) provides farmers with access to collateral-free finance by getting people to invest in crops and livestock and share the profits with the farmers when the produce goes to market.

This cohort was drawn from almost 2,000 applications from 60 countries.
During the programme, Yobante Express completed its first cross-border delivery from Harare to South Africa. Snapslip won second place at the inaugural Prosperity Games, a virtual investment experiment hosted by the UK SA Tech Hub.
The prize includes a trip to the UK to explore how this solution could be implemented abroad. Asilimia won the Africa Cup at the SA Innovation Summit which included a R5 million investment offer from the Unicorn Group.
