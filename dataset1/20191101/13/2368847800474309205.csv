傳谷歌母公司洽談收購Fitbit 專家不看好

01 Nov 2019, 13:07

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】近日媒體報導說，谷歌母公司Alphabet有收購穿戴式裝置大廠Fitbit的意願，雙方正在洽談。消息傳出後，10月28日Fitbit股價上漲最高逾30%，使公司市值達14億美元。不過，專家認為收購Fitbit並不能改變谷歌的劣勢，在軟件和硬件上都沒有太大收益。
Fitbit於2009年開始推出流行、便宜和簡單的智能手錶、健身手環等產品，受到不少消費者青睞。然而穿戴式產品價格趨向兩極化，蘋果、三星在高價的智能手錶市場占優勢，中國的小米、華為則以低價手環與手錶搶攻市占率，使位居中間價位帶的Fitbit面臨龐大壓力。
隨著蘋果越來越重視智能穿戴市場，Fitbit的收入連續三年下降是不足為奇的，因為該公司在中國的低端市場和蘋果的高端市場都受到擠壓，市場已有出售公司的傳聞。
此外，受到美中貿易戰衝擊，Fitbit已宣布自2020年1月起，包括智能手錶等所有產品生產線撤出中國。
Fitbit的收購將是谷歌在可穿戴設備領域的第二筆收購。今年早些時候，谷歌花了4,000萬美元從Fossil Group手中購買了一個尚未上市的神秘智能手錶技術。目前，谷歌的可穿戴設備系統Wear OS一直在掙扎，蘋果的Apple Watch和三星自家的Tizen的市占率都高於谷歌。

谷歌的可穿戴設備系統Wear OS採用率偏低，主要原因是硬件領域，谷歌缺乏自己專屬的優質系統芯片（SoC）。蘋果和三星都有自己的芯片設計部門，可生產智能手錶專屬的SoC讓它們的智能手錶均具有出色的性能和電池壽命優勢。蘋果和三星也在加大力度投資智能手錶硬件領域，並且這種硬件每年都在進步。而反觀谷歌沒有什麼優質專屬芯片可選，目前只有高通公司在2014年推出的Snapdragon 400可用，Android Wear整體性能與蘋果和三星的產品差距越來越大。
專家認為，在可穿戴設備市場，谷歌面臨著核心供應鏈問題，收購Fitbit並不能改變谷歌的劣勢，在軟件和硬件上都沒有太大收益。目前尚不清楚，谷歌收購案有多少的可行性和必要性。

Passing Google parent company to negotiate the acquisition of Fitbit experts are not optimistic

01 Nov 2019, 13:07

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 01, 2019] Recently, the media reported that Google's parent company Alphabet has the willingness to acquire Fitbit, a wearable device manufacturer, and the two sides are negotiating. After the news came out, on October 28th, Fitbit's share price rose by more than 30%, bringing the company's market value to $1.4 billion. However, experts believe that the acquisition of Fitbit does not change Google's disadvantages, and there is not much benefit in software and hardware.
In 2009, Fitbit began to introduce popular, cheap and simple smart watches, fitness bracelets and other products, which are favored by many consumers. However, the price of wearable products tends to be polarized. Apple and Samsung dominate the high-priced smart watch market. China's Xiaomi and Huawei are rushing to the market with low-priced bracelets and watches, making Fitbit facing the middle price belt huge. pressure.
As Apple pays more and more attention to the smart wear market, it is not surprising that Fitbit’s revenue has fallen for three consecutive years, as the company’s low-end market in China and Apple’s high-end market have been squeezed, and the market has been rumored to sell the company. .
In addition, affected by the US-China trade war, Fitbit has announced that since January 2020, all production lines including smart watches have been withdrawn from China.
Fitbit's acquisition will be Google's second acquisition in the field of wearables. Earlier this year, Google spent $40 million to buy a mysterious smartwatch technology from the Fossil Group that was not yet on the market. At present, Google's wearable device system Wear OS has been struggling, Apple's Apple Watch and Samsung's own Tizen market share is higher than Google.

Google's wearable device system Wear OS adoption rate is low, mainly due to hardware, Google lacks its own proprietary system chip (SoC). Both Apple and Samsung have their own chip design divisions that produce smart watch-specific SoCs that give their smart watches superior performance and battery life. Apple and Samsung are also investing heavily in smartwatch hardware, and this hardware is improving every year. In contrast, Google does not have any high-quality proprietary chips. Currently, only Snapdragon 400, which was launched by Qualcomm in 2014, is available. The overall performance of Android Wear is growing wider than that of Apple and Samsung.
Experts believe that in the wearable device market, Google is facing a core supply chain problem. The acquisition of Fitbit does not change Google's disadvantages, and there is not much benefit in software and hardware. It is not clear how much the feasibility and necessity of the Google acquisition is.
