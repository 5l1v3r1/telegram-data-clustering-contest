If you've yet to become the proud owner of a Nintendo Switch, a new sale at Target will see the portable console drop to just $379.
The Switch usually retails for $469.95 on the Nintendo Store and retailers don't usually drop it below $400 but a little sales hack means you can knock around $90 off the regular retail price. Target's dropped the price of the neon console to $429, but it's also got a clearance sale going at the moment to bring that down further. From now until the end of Sunday, Target will give you $50 off when you spend more than $200 in-store or online, which means you'll be able to get a Switch for just $379.
While the original Switch stock has most likely ran out at your local Target, try to make sure you get the newer Switch with battery life. You can tell by the model numbers but the box designs are more easily determined. The newer version has a completely red background on the box design.
If you've already got a Switch, you could use the deal to gift it to someone for Christmas or use the voucher for literally anything else available at Target. You've just gotta get to it before the sale ends at 11.59pm on Sunday, November 3.
