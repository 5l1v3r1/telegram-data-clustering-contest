2020 CAMS Australian Endurance Championship31 October, 2019

Australian GT have confirmed the date and venue for the final event of the 2020 CAMS Australian Endurance Championship, with the legendary Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit - the host of some of the most incredible GT battles of recent years - the scene of the third round of the new season in mid-August.
As part of the new-look Australian GT program for 2020, a dedicated GT Sportscar Festival will be introduced at the Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit in late March, the host of the second event of the Endurance Championship, before returning to Phillip Island in August - the calendar providing teams access to arguably the two best circuits in the country in addition to the season-opening Bathurst 12-Hour in February.
The GT Sportscar Festival in March will see the Australian GT teams and cars sit centre-stage with dedicated events for the CAMS Australian Endurance Championship, the GT4 Championship and Trophy Series cars combined with Trofeo Challenge and Invited cars.
The support act is being finalised and will be revealed in the coming weeks, with Australian GT management keen to ensure the event showcases the best of GT and sportscar racing in Australia, with the highlight being the 4-hour endurance event set for Sunday, March 22.
The August event will follow a similar format, with the CAMS Australian Endurance Championship taking centre stage once more, whilst GT4 and the combined Trophy Series, Trofeo Challenge and Invited cars will all enjoy their own ‘Sprint’ events.
“After so many seasons of following a similar format, we needed to ensure the 2020 calendar was in line with what teams were looking for, but also flexible enough that we could enjoy significant track time, and ensure our teams took centre stage,” Australian GT Category Manager David Vervaart explained.
“Starting at the Bathurst 12 Hour - where registered CAMS Australian Endurance Championship entrants will achieve points based on their respective finishing positions - was a logical choice given it was an event that many of the teams were attending. From Australia’s most iconic circuit, heading to arguably Australia’s second most popular venue provided an opportunity for teams to turn laps on two of the country’s best circuits, and that has been very well received.
“With the 2020 CAMS Australian GT Championship calendar already receiving excellent reviews, and a pending GT4 Championship calendar due for release in coming days, the 2020 program looks to be one of the best ever delivered, and we’re focussed on ensuring that for the teams and the drivers, that it’s the racing that takes centre stage,” Vervaart concluded.
