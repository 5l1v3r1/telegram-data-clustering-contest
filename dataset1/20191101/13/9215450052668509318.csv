按揭保險兩大誤解！置業人士小心免中伏
01 Nov 2019, 13:14 by 樓市
政府放寬首置人士申請九成按揭保險的樓價上限，無疑助供得起但無首期的市民上車。惟置業人士對新修訂存在誤解。恐防樓市泡沬爆破、湧現負資產潮前，準業主已先變苦主，上會不成焗撻訂，最終樓錢兩失，蝕住退場。

放寬按揭保險樓價上限
按證公司放寬申請九成樓按的按保樓價上限，從400萬上調至800萬元。上車客首期由320萬元急降至80萬元。樓按專家黎家良指出，《施政報告》公布前，即使入職起薪高的專業人士如醫生、高級公務員等，入息足以通過壓力測試。奈何，因未儲夠首期以致望門輕嘆。
即使買800萬元的住宅，在可以敘造九成按揭下，首期僅80萬，已可盡快上車。新修訂後，買家亦不需單靠向發展商造二按，才借到錢付首期。上車客要注意每月供款金額急升，在未放寬樓價上限前，每月供款19,300元，惟以一成首期上車， 供款額急升近50%，這是現時市況買樓前要注意的事項。

當然以往買樓可以向銀行借入按保保費，然後連同貸款分開若干年攤還。按證公司修訂新例後，這個做法暫無改變。根據按保公司發出的有關按揭保險計劃修訂的新聞稿第四點指出，放寬按揭保險樓價上限後，仍要符合不高於供款入息比率（Debt Servicing Ratio，DSR）50%的上限，並須符合銀行壓力測試。
不過同一點指出，首置客如未能符合壓力測試，仍可申請最高八成或九成按揭，其保費會因應風險因素作額外調整。故近日有評論指，新修訂變相免除首置人士的壓力測試。然而，作為樓按專家的黎家良糾正，這是很多人的誤解，事實上並未免除壓力測試。黎家良解釋，買家申請貸款時先要過兩關。第一關是供款入息比率不得高於50％。
第二關才到壓力測試，即假設現有按揭利率額外加上升3厘後的供款額，仍然低於供款入息上限的60%。而政府所謂即使壓力測試「肥佬」，仍可靠調高按保讓首置人士申請到最成數按揭，實際執行起來其實存在不確定性。日前已有傳媒就上述修訂向銀行查詢，銀行接受訪時均以不予置評或視乎個案而定。由此推測，似乎銀行對於會否批出按揭予壓測「肥佬」的申請人態度曖昧。
黎家良指出，置業人士提交按保申請其實是要經銀行處理，銀行會先進行按揭審批。未能通過壓力測試的準業主分分鐘在此階段已「截住咗」不會獲批。亦即是說，如果銀行在這關已落閘，已再沒有申請按保需要。因此，新政策之修訂名義上可行，「但（潛台詞）是壓測唔過的話， 申請無機會交上按證公司畀佢加保費。」而據行內人士向銀行的按揭部門了解，銀行並不會跟從上述修訂。故保費因應風險因素作額外調整亦是空口講白話。
小心過不到壓力測試
新修訂上星期出台，不少買家陸續向銀行申請按揭貸款。若屢被不同銀行拒批，「試咗幾間都唔得嘅，仲唔打去報紙嘈？」黎家良預料，將來會出現準業主未能通過壓力測試，以致「上唔到會」要「撻訂」，上車客以苦主身分現身說法的報道。
按保公司修訂按保計劃後，放寬申請八成樓按的按保樓價上限至1,000萬元。由於早前普遍的三房單位叫價接近1,000萬元，故換樓客也受惠按保計劃修訂。不過，從中衍生另一個誤解，不少人以為，可透過申請八成按揭的按保而加按套現。
因為在未放寬樓按樓價上限前，買800萬元樓要支付四成首期，即320萬元。而最新措施為可以支付兩成首期「上車」，是否可以利用按保計劃套現？黎家良表示按保公司不容許這樣加按套現。不過，業主可透過進行新買賣交易或透過財務公司加按套現。
話說回來，現時換樓的方法為「先賣後買」，而非「先買後賣」。黎家良指出：「換樓客買唔到樓可以租樓先，唔會死。惟買了新樓又不能及時沽出舊樓，新樓成交唔到會死，因為無錢畀新樓尾樓，就要撻訂。故現時換樓策略為先賣後買比較保險。」
另外，有些人收入不足以申請樓按，故想方法透過自動轉賬每月過數或請第三方開支票給自己，以證明自己有足夠收入。黎家良指此路不通，根據他多年從事銀行業經驗，按保公司最相信稅單上的收入。即使按保公司沒有明確列出，如果不能提交稅單，就一定不批准該宗的按保申請。他奉勸置業者要將所以收入報稅，以增加獲批按保的勝算。

Mortgage insurance two major misunderstandings! Home buyers are careful to avoid
01 Nov 2019, 13:14 by the property market
The Government has relaxed the upper limit of the maximum price of the 90% mortgage insurance for the first-time applicants. This will undoubtedly help the public who have no first-time mortgage to get on the train. However, home buyers have misunderstood the new revision. Fear of the property market bubble blasting, the emergence of negative assets before the tide, the prospective owners have become bitter, the top will not be set, the final loss of money, eclipse exit.

Relaxation of mortgage insurance property ceiling
According to the company's relaxation, the maximum price of the mortgage-paying property that was applied for 90% of the building was raised from 4 million to 8 million yuan. The first phase of the passengers dropped from 3.2 million yuan to 800,000 yuan. According to the expert Li Jialiang, before the announcement of the ""Policy Report"", even if the professionals with high starting salary, such as doctors and senior civil servants, are able to pass the stress test. Why, because the first period was not saved, the door was sighed.
Even if you buy a house of 8 million yuan, you can make a 90% mortgage, and the first phase is only 800,000. You can get on the train as soon as possible. After the new amendment, the buyer does not need to make a second mortgage to the developer alone. The passengers should pay attention to the monthly increase in the amount of contributions. Before the ceiling of the property price has been relaxed, the monthly contribution will be 19,300 yuan. However, the first time I get on the train, the contribution will rise by nearly 50%. This is the current market condition. Things to pay attention to in front of the building.

Of course, in the past, you can borrow a premium from a bank and then amortize it separately with the loan for several years. After the revision of the new case by the company, this practice has not changed. According to the fourth point of the press release issued by the company, the mortgage insurance property price ceiling is still subject to a ceiling of 50% below the Debt Servicing Ratio (DSR). It must also comply with the bank stress test.
However, the same point indicates that if the first customer fails to meet the stress test, they can still apply for a maximum of 80% or 90% of the mortgage, and their premiums will be adjusted for additional risk factors. Therefore, some recent comments pointed out that the new revision disguised the first-person pressure test. However, as Li Jialiang, an expert on the floor, corrected this, this is a misunderstanding of many people. In fact, it has not been exempted from stress testing. Li Jialiang explained that buyers must first pass two levels when applying for a loan. The first level is that the contribution income ratio must not exceed 50%.
The second level is the stress test, which assumes that the existing mortgage interest rate will increase by an additional 3%, which is still less than 60% of the contribution income ceiling. The Government's so-called stress test ""fat"" is still a reliable increase. In order to ensure that the first-time applicants apply for the most numerous mortgages, there is actually uncertainty in the actual implementation. Recently, the media has inquired about the above amendments. The banks are not allowed to comment or depending on the case. It is speculated that it seems that the bank is not satisfied with the applicants who will grant mortgages to the ""fertilizer"".
Li Jialiang pointed out that the application for insurance by the home buyers is actually subject to bank processing, and the bank will first conduct mortgage approval. Quasi-owners who fail to pass the stress test will be ""blocked"" at this stage in minutes and will not be approved. That is to say, if the bank has already closed at this level, it has no longer applied for insurance. Therefore, the amendment of the new policy is nominally feasible. ""But (subtext) is a pressure test, and the application has no opportunity to pay the premium to the certificate company."" According to the insider's mortgage department, the bank Will not follow the above amendments. Therefore, the premium adjustment for the risk factor is also an empty talk.
Be careful not to stress test
The new amendment was introduced last week, and many buyers have applied to the bank for mortgage loans. If it has been repeatedly disapproved by different banks, ""A few trials have won a lot of money. Does Zhongkai hit the newspapers?"" Li Jialiang expects that in the future, prospective owners will fail to pass the stress test, so that ""the captain will come to the meeting"" to ""挞""Settings"", the report of the passengers on the bus.
After the insurance company revised the insurance plan, the maximum price of the mortgage-paying property of 80% of the building was reduced to 10 million yuan. Since the prevailing price of the three-bedroom unit was close to $10 million, the change-off customers also benefited from the insurance plan. However, another misunderstanding has been derived from it. Many people think that it can be cashed in by applying for a mortgage of 80%.
Because before the maximum price of the building is not relaxed, the purchase of 8 million yuan will pay 40% of the first period, that is, 3.2 million yuan. The latest measure is to pay 20% of the first phase of ""getting on the train"". Can it be cashed out using the insurance plan? Li Jialiang said that the company does not allow such an increase in cash. However, the landlord can make a new transaction or through a financial company.
In other words, the current method of changing flats is to ""sell first and then buy"" instead of ""buy and sell first"". Li Jialiang pointed out: ""If you change the floor to buy a building, you can rent the building first, and you will die. But if you buy a new building, you can't get out the old building in time. The new building will be destroyed, because there is no money for the new building. It is necessary to make a decision. Therefore, the current strategy for changing flats is to buy and buy more insurance.""
In addition, some people do not have enough income to apply for a flat, so they would like to use the automatic transfer to pass the monthly number or ask a third party to write a check to prove that they have sufficient income. Li Jialiang pointed out that this road is unreasonable. According to his years of experience in the banking industry, the company is most convinced of the income on the tax bill. Even if the insurance company does not explicitly list it, if the tax bill cannot be submitted, the insurance application will not be approved. He advised home buyers to file their income tax returns in order to increase the chances of winning the insurance.
