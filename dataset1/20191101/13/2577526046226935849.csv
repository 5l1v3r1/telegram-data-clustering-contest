Tub Geralt Takes Centre Stage in Netflix's Official Witcher Trailer
01 Nov 2019, 13:15 by Alistair Jones
The showrunners behind Netflix’s Witcher series have made clear that they’re drawing from the fantasy book series rather than CDPR’s RPG trilogy. For my money, that’s the right idea, offering a far more grounded way in to Geralt’s adventures than his amnesia-riddled romp through The Witcher 1 and 2. However, the new trailer for the series, which dropped last night, does raise a question: If Netflix is focusing on the books, where did that tub Geralt scene come from, hmm?
Yesterday’s trailer, which debuted at Lucca Comics 2019, is a whistle stop tour of the short stories that help set up the world of the Witcher. The biggest narrative thread it offers would appear to be the First War with Nilfgaard, culminating in what looks like the southern empire’s conquering of Cintra.



There are a number of cameos from characters like Cahir, Jaskier (Dandelion), and Princess Renfri, but unsurprisingly, Yennefer, Ciri, and Geralt dominate proceedings, with the latter showing off some fancy swordplay throughout. The witcher fights Nilfgaardians, peasants, knights, foglets, and pretty much anything else he can get within a sword’s length of.
The trailer also confirms that the series will release on December 20. That’s a couple of days later than previous leaks have suggested, but very much in-line with Netflix’s late-2019 predictions. More importantly, however, it should give me plenty of time to re-read those short stories.
