Trump announced Thursday night that he and first lady Melania will leave New York City and make their permanent home in Florida.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also signaled that he is happy to see Trump go.
“Good riddance,” he wrote on Twitter. “He’s all yours, Florida”:



By moving to Palm Beach, Florida, the Trumps will escape the combined New York State and New York City income tax of 12.7 percent. Their assets will also be free of a 16 percent New York estate tax on assets more than $5.75 million, according to Forbes.
