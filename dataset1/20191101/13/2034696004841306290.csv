The ‘New Rules’ pop star signalled her “new era” at the beginning of the month by posting an image of herself sporting a new blonde look. “Thank you for your patience. See you soon,” she told fans, who have been eagerly awaiting the follow-up to her 2017 self-titled debut.
Lipa described the new song ‘Don’t Start Now’ as a “pure adrenalin fuelled, feel good dance floor anthem of positivity and self-empowerment.”
“I chose to put this song out first so I could close one chapter of my life and start another,” she said. “Into a new era with a new sound! It’s about moving on and not allowing anyone to get in the way of that. It also felt like a natural first song choice as I made it with the brilliant same crew I made ‘New Rules’ with.”
On the infectious single, Lipa sings, “Don’t show up/ Don’t come out/ Don’t start caring about me now/ Walk away/ You know how.”

This first taste of LP2 comes after Lipa revealed that the project would have a “disco influence“ and be “more mature” compared to her first studio effort. The star also confirmed that she had spent time in the studio with disco icon Nile Rodgers.
“My new record is still pop and it is really fun, but it is definitely more conceptual. I had the album title and went from that,” she explained.
“It would prob­a­bly be risky if I wasn’t risky with the next record. ​I don’t think it would be as fun if I tried to recre­ate the first record. As an artist, you con­stant­ly want to grow and change your per­spec­tive and try some­thing new.”
Dua Lipa has previously cited the likes of Prince, OutKast, “old Gwen Stefani” and No Doubt as inspiration for her upcoming new album.
