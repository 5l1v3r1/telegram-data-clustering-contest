Guide: Pokémon Sword And Shield - All Gen 8 Pokémon Announced For The Galar Region
All the new Generation 8 Pokémon revealed for Sword and Shield so far
01 Nov 2019, 13:30 by Gavin Lane



We're getting very close to the launch of Pokémon Sword and Shield, the latest in the mainline Pokémon series and our introduction to a new generation of Pocket Monsters. Gen 8 will feature an entirely new roster of Pokémon and we've collected the entire list of the announced Gen 8 Pokémon below for your viewing pleasure.
We'll update this list as more Pokémon and details are revealed (with Pokédex numbers, version exclusivity, etc). Here we're concentrating on the completely brand-spanking new Pokémon confirmed to be coming to Pokémon Sword and Shield, but there's a hefty number of past Pokémon returning to the Galar Pokédex, too (including regional versions like Galarian Ponyta). Some of those are exclusive to either Pokémon Sword or Shield - check out our version-exclusive list to find out which old favourites are available in which game.
Let's have a look at all the brand new faces below...
