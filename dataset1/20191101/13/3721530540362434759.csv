Registeel is not the most sought after Pokémon in Pokémon Go, but it’s a necessary part for those participating in the Colossal Discovery event, as well as those who are just trying to complete their Pokédex.
Registeel is weak against fire-, ground- and fighting-type moves, so it should go down fairly easily. Try using the following against it:

Moltres with Fire Spin and Overheat/Flamethrower
Entei with Fire Spin/Fire Fang and Overheat
Charizard with Fire Spin and Blast Burn
Machamp with Counter/Karate Chop and Dynamic Punch

You can also use Pokémon like Groudon with Mud Shot and Earthquake. Just don’t use ice-, rock- or fairy-type Pokémon in this matchup.
Lucky players may encounter a Shiny Registeel. Do note that if you do see a Shiny, it will catch on the first ball you hit it with, so use a Pinap Berry to score some extra candy.

Once you nab your Registeel, make sure it knows the moves Metal Claw and Flash Cannon for it to make the most of its steel-typing, but do note that Registeel is not that great of an attacker.
Registeel will leave raids with its siblings on Nov. 4 at 4 p.m. ET.
