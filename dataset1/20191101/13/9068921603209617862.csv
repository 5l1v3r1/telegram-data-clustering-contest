MacRumors and Mophie have partnered up again to offer our readers a chance to get 20 percent off sitewide on Zagg.com, which includes Zagg itself, Mophie, Braven, Invisible Shield, iFrogz, Gear4, and Halo. With this deal, you can save money on portable batteries, battery cases, charging cables, and more.

Here you can enter the promo code RUMORS20 and click apply to see the 20 percent discount taken off the most expensive item in your cart. This discount can be applied across all of Zagg's brands, and it can be used twice per customer. You'll have until December 31, 2019 to use the code, so it should be a great way to save some money during your holiday shopping this season.
