KRA Commissioner of Intelligence Tera Saidimu said the 21 vehicles, among them Range Rovers, Mercedes Benz, BWMs were nabbed between month of March and September.
Saidimu told the press that KRA was keen to deliver on President Uhuru Kenyatta’s commitment to root out illicit trade in the country, particularly in ports of entry.
“In returning these vehicles, we wish to send a strong message to criminal network in East Africa and beyond that the port of Mombasa will not be used as a conduit for illicit trade,” said Saidimu.
