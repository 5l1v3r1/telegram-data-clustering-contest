Bournemouth v Manchester United: match preview
01 Nov 2019, 13:35 by Guardian Staff
Manchester United are targeting a fourth consecutive win in all competitions after an encouraging upturn in results, with Ole Gunnar Solskjær stating the October international break reinvigorated his squad after a tricky start to the season. Marcus Rashford, who scored a sublime free-kick in midweek, is touch-and-go owing to injury, while the defenders Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelöf are also doubts. Bournemouth, who failed to register a single goal last month, could welcome back the midfielder Dan Gosling following a hip injury. Ben Fisher
