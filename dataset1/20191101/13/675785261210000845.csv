The online retail giant is rolling out price cuts on top branded versions from Rituals, Nivea, Lynx and Dove.
The Rituals 2D Christmas Tree advent calendar , normally costs 59.90 and contains items worth £118.45. But Amazon shoppers can save £10 off and get it for £49.90 instead - the cheapest price we have found online.

Shoppers can pick one up for £28.99 and get free delivery too.



 
The retailer has also slashed the price of its own beauty advent calendar too .
The £50 calendar is filled with make up and skincare goodies worth a whopping £220 but in the sale is £10 cheaper - a saving of 20% off for shoppers looking to bag one before December arrives.
