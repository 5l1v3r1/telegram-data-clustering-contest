Google新手機上市 Pixel新舊機評比

01 Nov 2019, 13:04

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】Google在今年10月份推出新機Pixel 4和4 XL，讓Google智能手機的陣容又增添了兩名性能優秀的選手，得以與其他科技大廠分庭抗禮。
隨著新機上市，Pixel智能手機目前已有3a、3、4，以及對應的XL機種可選擇（XL幾乎只有螢幕大小與電池容量的差異），起價從399美元到899美元不等。Google至今部署了中階至頂級機種完整的產品線，標示著其在智能手機市場一打江山的決心。

自從2016年Google第一次推出「Made by Google」手機「Pixel」以來，Google就展現其衝刺手機高端市場的野心。但智能手機市場異常激烈，儘管Google財力雄厚，作為硬體新手，仍需逐步試誤，完善供應鏈，造成前些年慘淡經營的窘境。差強人意的成績單也讓許多人懷疑Google是否會繼續朝手機戰場的核心推進？
今年分別推出的Pixel 3a與Pixel 4，就是Google給我們的答案。
從2015年以來，以搜尋引擎起家的Google，一直想改善過度依賴廣告收入的問題。經過幾年的調整，廣告收入的佔比已從90%逐步下降到83%。在增加多元營收的計劃裡，重中之重就是Pixel的產品線，Google不僅投入大量資源研發，更花了11億美金購買HTC的許多專利與人才。
2019年第二季的財報終於得到了佳音。Google的CEO桑達‧皮查伊（Sundar Pichai）宣布，得Pixel 3a之助，Google智能手機的銷量，對比去年同期成長為2倍。10月份，Google又再度推出Pixel 4，加強了拍攝功能、安全晶片、動作感應雷達等，希望跟iPhone與三星的高階手機分庭抗禮。對消費者來說，則又多了一個具有特色的選擇。
以下，我們將就Pixel 3a、3、4做簡要的評析，協助讀者認識各產品的差異點，了解Google為適應市場做出了什麼努力。

Pixel 3a：中階手機極佳拍攝效果

Pixel 3a和Pixel 3a XL是Google Pixel手機系列中的平價款，它也是Pixel智能手機系列的入門機種。為了因應市場需要，Google取消了Pixel 3的一些功能，以低成本的方式，設計了Pixel 3a這支平價手機。
相較於早先推出的Pixel 3，Pixel 3a和Pixel 3a XL沒有無線充電的功能，螢幕尺寸也略為縮小，硬體部份使用的是中階的硬體規格，手機的整體速度會比Pixel 3稍慢。
然而，Google沒有打算讓Pixel 3a低階化。從外觀上看，Pixel 3a具有高階手機般的質感，且Pixel 3a也是一支照相功能極佳的手機，它使用了與Pixel 3完全相同的後置單鏡頭，鏡頭像素高達1220萬，光圈大小F1.8，可錄製最高4K、30Hz的影片。
Google也替Pixel 3a的用戶準備了無限的相片儲存空間，可儲存高質量的圖片和影片（圖片上限1600萬像素，影片上限1080p）。對於喜愛拍照並紀錄生活的人來說，無限量的網路儲存空間非常方便。
在價格方面，配備5.6英寸螢幕、3,000 mAh電池和64 GB存儲空間的Pixel 3a起價為399美元。配備6英寸螢幕、3700mAh電池和64 GB存儲空間的Pixel 3a XL，售價為479美元。
整體而言，Pixel 3a適合經濟能力有限，但又想要嘗試高階手機的消費者。另外，如果你對手機速度沒有特別要求，但想擁有Pixel的高品質相機和照片，那Pixel 3a是很好的選擇。

Pixel 3：無限制原圖備份超優惠

Pixel 3這款手機其實比Pixel 3a舊， Google於2018年10月首次發布了Pixel 3，隨後於2019年5月發布了Pixel 3a。
與其他Pixel系列手機一樣，Pixel 3也有兩種尺寸。 Pixel 3的螢幕為5.5英寸，而Pixel 3 XL則為6.3英寸。兩種型號採用的都是高通的Snapdragon 845處理器，消費者購買時可選擇64 GB或128 GB兩種空間大小。
在手機的電池部分，Pixel 3用的是2,915mAh電池，而Pixel 3 XL則是用3,430mAh電池，兩款手機都可以進行無線充電。
Pixel 3配置單一主鏡頭，前置鏡頭則有兩顆，能讓人拍出廣角的自拍照和影片。Pixel 3 XL螢幕頂部的攝像頭切口（又稱瀏海螢幕），卻造成許多用戶的抱怨，很多使用者認為這個設計很難看，甚至還出現了可以讓人隱藏這個切口的App。

目前隨著Pixel 4的推出，Pixel 3也推出折價活動。目前官網上兩款手機都提供了減價300美金優惠，Pixel 3起價為499美元，Pixel 3 XL起價為599美元。如果是學生，還提供了額外再減價100美金的超低優惠。
Pixel 3、3 XL是目前全系列中，唯二提供無限制照片、影片「原檔備份」的手機。如果在意Google雲端影像備份的畫質，Pixel 3將很適合您，畢竟即使已推出一年的時間，Pixel 3和Pixel 3 XL仍是性能穩定，且有高品質相機功能的手機。

Pixel 4：人臉辨識、90Hz螢幕、雷達手勢操作、拍攝更提升

今年10月15日，Google推出了Pixel系列中最新的手機Pixel 4和Pixel 4 XL。如果你喜愛嘗試一些最新的科技功能，那Pixel 4可能是你的最佳選擇。
Pixel 4和Pixel 4 XL皆使用高通的Snapdragon 855處理器，手機速度比以往的Pixel系列手機還要快。這款手機的特點在於前鏡頭Soli雷達感應技術（Motion Sense），這項技術可以讓用戶透過手勢播放音樂或者暫停鬧鐘，未來會有更多APP可以支援應用。
在推出這款手機時，Google用「3D 臉部解鎖功能」（Face Unlock）取代了「指紋辨識功能」。Pixel 4設有紅外線照射器、紅外線微點投影器以及紅外線相機，因此可偵測使用者的臉部 3D 曲線，完全不用碰觸手機就能安全解鎖。
然而，近日有人發現，人臉解鎖在眼睛閉著時也可完成，可能造成使用者睡著時，手機能被其他人打開，Google表示將全力解決這個問題。
Pixel 4的螢幕使用支援90Hz顯示的OLED面板。傳統手機螢幕皆是60Hz，今年三星首先將螢幕換成90Hz的螢幕，流暢性大幅提升，並降低屏閃對人眼的損害。Pixel 4也同樣使用90Hz螢幕，並會自動判斷功能是否需要開始，節省大量的電力。
讓消費者期待的還有Pixel 4的雙鏡頭設計，Pixel 4背後除了1220萬畫素f/1.7鏡頭外，還增加了1600萬畫素f/2.4的望遠鏡頭。雙鏡頭設計可達到2倍光學變焦、8倍數位變焦，較前一代5倍數位變焦提升許多。
Pixel 4和Pixel 3都有夜拍模式，但歸功於Google強大的演算法，Pixel 4的夜拍能力又大幅增強，增加了「星空攝影」的功能，在漆黑的夜空中都可以拍出銀河的美麗蹤跡。
除此之外，雙重曝光控制與Live HDR+也是重要的提升。Pixel 3拍照時只能調整亮部光線，但Pixel 4可同時調整亮部光線與陰影強度。Live HDR+方面，除了比過往更極限的高反差照片外，預覽的影像也與拍攝結果相當，可以直觀拍攝結果。
但比較可惜的是，Pixel 4取消了無限存儲原始照片和影片的功能，這部分的調整也讓一些消費者感到遺憾。

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time, November 01, 2019] Google launched the new Pixel 4 and 4 XL in October this year, which added two high-performance players to the lineup of Google smartphones, and was able to compete with other technology giants.
With the launch of the new machine, Pixel smartphones are currently available in 3a, 3, 4, and the corresponding XL models (XL has almost the difference between screen size and battery capacity), starting at $399 to $899.

Since Google launched the ""Made by Google"" mobile phone ""Pixel"" for the first time in 2016, Google has demonstrated its ambition to sprint the high-end market. However, the smartphone market is extremely fierce. Although Google has strong financial resources, as a newcomer to hardware, it still needs to gradually try and correct, and improve the supply chain, resulting in a dilemma in the past few years. The poor transcripts also made many people wonder if Google will continue to push towards the core of the mobile battlefield.
Pixel 3a and Pixel 4, which were launched this year, are the answers Google gave us.
Since 2015, Google, which started with a search engine, has been trying to improve the problem of over-reliance on advertising revenue. After several years of adjustment, the proportion of advertising revenue has gradually dropped from 90% to 83%. In the plan to increase multi-revenue, the top priority is Pixel's product line. Google not only invested a lot of resources in research and development, but also spent more than 1.1 billion US dollars to purchase many patents and talents of HTC.
The financial report for the second quarter of 2019 finally got good news. Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that with the help of Pixel 3a, sales of Google smartphones have doubled compared to the same period last year. In October, Google re-launched Pixel 4, enhanced its shooting capabilities, security chips, motion-sensing radar, etc., and hoped to compete with the iPhone and Samsung's high-end mobile phones.

Overall, Pixel 3a is suitable for consumers who have limited economic capabilities but want to try high-end phones. In addition, if you have no special requirements for mobile phone speed, but want to have Pixel's high quality cameras and photos, then Pixel 3a is a good choice.

Pixel 3 is actually older than Pixel 3a. Google first released Pixel 3 in October 2018, followed by Pixel 3a in May 2019.
Like other Pixel series phones, the Pixel 3 comes in two sizes. The Pixel 3 has a 5.5-inch screen and the Pixel 3 XL has a 6.3-inch screen. Both models use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 845 processor, which can be purchased at 64 GB or 128 GB.
In the battery part of the phone, the Pixel 3 uses a 2,915 mAh battery, while the Pixel 3 XL uses a 3,430 mAh battery, both of which can be wirelessly charged.
The Pixel 3 features a single main lens and two front-facing lenses that allow for wide-angle selfies and movies.

If you care about the quality of Google Cloud Image Backup, Pixel 3 will be perfect for you. After a year, Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL are still stable and have high quality camera features.

Pixel 4: face recognition, 90Hz screen, radar gesture operation, shooting improvement

On October 15 this year, Google launched the latest mobile phones Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL in the Pixel series. If you love to try some of the latest technology features, then Pixel 4 may be your best choice.
Both Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 processor, which is faster than previous Pixel phones. The phone features a front lens Soli radar sensing technology (Motion Sense), which allows users to play music or pause alarms through gestures, and more apps will support the app in the future.
In the launch of this phone, Google replaced the ""fingerprint recognition function"" with ""3D Face Unlock"" (Face Unlock). The Pixel 4 features an infrared illuminator, an infrared micro-point projector, and an infrared camera, so it can detect the user's face 3D curve and unlock it safely without touching the phone.
However, some people have recently discovered that the face can be unlocked when the eyes are closed, which may cause the phone to be opened by others when the user is asleep. Google said that it will solve the problem.
The Pixel 4 screen uses an OLED panel that supports 90Hz display. The traditional mobile phone screens are all 60Hz. This year, Samsung first changed the screen to a 90Hz screen, which greatly improved the fluency and reduced the damage of the screen flash to the human eye. Pixel 4 also uses a 90Hz screen and automatically determines if the function needs to start, saving a lot of power.
Consumers are also looking forward to the Pixel 4's dual lens design. In addition to the 12.2 million pixel f/1.7 lens, the Pixel 4 adds 16 million pixel f/2.4 telescope heads. The dual lens design achieves 2x optical zoom and 8x digital zoom, which is much better than the previous generation 5x digital zoom.
Both Pixel 4 and Pixel 3 have a night shot mode, but thanks to Google's powerful algorithm, Pixel 4's night shot capability has been greatly enhanced, adding the ""Starry Sky Photography"" feature, which can be used to shoot Galaxy in the dark night sky. Beautiful trails.
In addition, dual exposure control and Live HDR+ are also important enhancements. Pixel 3 can only adjust the highlight light when taking pictures, but Pixel 4 can adjust the highlight light and shadow intensity at the same time. In terms of Live HDR+, in addition to the high-contrast photos that are more extreme than in the past, the previewed images are also comparable to the results, and the results can be captured intuitively.
But it is a pity that Pixel 4 cancels the unlimited storage of original photos and videos, and this part of the adjustment has also made some consumers regret.
