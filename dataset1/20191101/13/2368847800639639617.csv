微軟文件洩露Windows 10X 將登陸其平板電腦

01 Nov 2019, 13:08

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】微軟（Microsoft）意外地發布了其即將推出的Windows 10X作業系統的內部設計文檔，隨即由WalkingCat捕獲，該文檔日前於網上一閃即逝，但也披漏出Windows 10X計畫的一些細節。
這家軟體巨頭最初推出Windows 10X為操作系統，為公司新Surface Neo平板電腦供電，但也將在類似的雙屏設備上運行。
微軟迄今只正式確認Windows 10X將在可折疊和雙屏設備上推出，對傳統「啟動」功能表和任務欄都做了調整，但很明顯，公司現在雄心勃勃要將這些變化引入傳統的翻蓋筆記本電腦硬件。
洩露文件中說，Windows 10X把啟動功能表叫做啟動器，更強調本地搜索：與網站搜索結合的天衣無縫，其上還有各種程序、和特定檔案等。並根據你最常用的程序、檔案和網站，做內容動態更新。Windows 10X還將改進Windows Hello面部識別身分驗證。
微軟還提到一個「現代檔資管理器」。長期以來，微軟一直在研究傳統檔資源管理器的現代版，看來其最終將與Windows 10X一起亮相。它可能是觸摸友好型的，並易於訪問存儲在Office 365、OneDrive和其它雲服務中的文檔。
Windows 10X中的操作中心（通知中心）也得以簡化，可快速設置快速進入。並優先顯示重要設置（如電池壽命）。它也將支持自設，但Wi-Fi、儲存格資料、藍牙、飛安模式、旋轉鎖定和投影都是預設的快速設置。
