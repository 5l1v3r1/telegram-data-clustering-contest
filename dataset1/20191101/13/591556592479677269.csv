The company says that over half of Chinese companies are now customers of Alibaba Cloud.




Alibaba reported strong second-quarter financial results on Friday, beating analyst expectations and revealing strong growth in the firm's cloud business.  In Q2 2019 (statement), Alibaba reported revenue growth of 40 percent year-over-year, reaching 119 billion yuan ($16.7 billion) and earnings per share of $3.85, or non-GAAP EPS of $1.83, an increase of 36 percent year-over-year. 
Analysts expected revenue of 116.8 billion yuan, as reported by Reuters.

Alibaba's cloud computing revenue grew by 64 percent year-over-year to 9,291 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) during Q2. The vendor says that demand has been primarily driven by an increase in average revenue per customer, and as of August this year, 59 percent of all registered companies in China are customers of Alibaba Cloud.  Alibaba says that the Chinese market, in both the public sector and traditional industries, is poised for the ""transformation of business models and processes through digitization of customer insight, inventory, workflow, resource planning, and other aspects.""
""As an Internet technology company that has pioneered digital transformation, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to maintain our leadership in providing cloud services that are not only cost-effective but also enable businesses to operate more intelligently,"" the company added.

We will continue to invest in the user experience and innovative technology to create new value for consumers, as well as the millions of enterprises undergoing digital transformation in the new digital economy."" TechRepublic: The worldwide cloud market grew 37% in Q3, reached $27.5B In related news, last month Alibaba acquired NetEase's Kaola import e-commerce platform in a deal worth $2 billion.
