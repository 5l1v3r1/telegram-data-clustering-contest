Hundreds of families in Eaglesham turned out in force at the weekend to battle off evil spirits.
Filled with community togetherness and guised in colourful and scary outfits, their united front was no match for any would-be evils.
Wishing to mark their territory, they lined the common land with their own specially carved pumpkins as part of the second annual Jack in the Orry event, organised by Tracey White.

Over 300 pumpkins were carved as part of the spooktacular event as locals welcomed back their pal Jack.
That saw local residents, groups, clubs and the artistic among the community carve a pumpkin for Hallowe’en and line the path of the Orry.

The result was a fantastic offering of spooky, eerie and colourful squashes of all shapes and sizes lining the centre of the historic village.
And there was plenty of surprises in store, not least a hidden Grufallo trail, with fantastic artwork and carved pumpkins in keeping with Julia Donaldson’s classic novel.

Volunteers collected for the local food bank appeal at the event, helping to add to the brilliant community spirit.
Our snapper Dom Cocozza popped on his brave suit and headed along to help tackle all things scary and spooky.
