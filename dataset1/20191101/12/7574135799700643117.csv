William Patrick (Billy) Corgan releasing new double LP ‘Cotillions’ this month
01 Nov 2019, 12:50 by Jeremy Nifras



The Smashing Pumpkins’ Billy Corgan has announced a new 17-track, double album titled Cotillions which is out November 22 on his own Martha’s Music label. Like on 2017’s Ogilala, he’s releasing under his full name, William Patrick Corgan. He announced the album on his socials, saying fans should hear it for themselves “before others tell you what my songs are or aren’t”:
COTILLIONS: NOV 22, this double album, a true labor of love, is available on all digital platforms. All you have to do is pre-subscribe so you can see the song titles and have it waiting for you the moment it comes out. Don’t miss the chance to hear it for yourself before others tell you what my songs are or aren’t. There is a reason I trust you, the people who support me day in and day out, to decide whether or not my efforts are worthy. We live in a different world now, where an artist can speak directly to you without the filter of mass media shaping your heart and opinions before you’ve even had a chance to decide whether this music speaks to you. And this is absolutely an album from my heart. […] I can’t thank you enough for the support I’ve been given to make moments like this possible.
Billy went on to say that a new Smashing Pumpkins album “will be out soon enough.” The band’s last album, Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1 / LP: No Past. No Future. No Sun., was released last year, and saw the return of original drummer Jimmy Chamberlin and guitarist James Iha.
You can read Billy’s announcement, and view the LP’s tracklist, below. Billy also kicks off a US solo tour next week, with a three-night run at NYC’s Gramercy Theatre on November 18, 19, and 20 (tickets).
