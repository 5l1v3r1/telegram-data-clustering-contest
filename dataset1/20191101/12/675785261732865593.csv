Halloween may have only just finished a few hours ago, but Costa is wasting no time getting in the Christmas spirit, having just announced that their festive cups for 2019 are now officially in stores.
Announced on their Twitter page today (Friday 1st November), the new cups feature adorable reindeer, penguin and Father Christmas designs, which are launching alongside the coffee chain's new limited edition winter menu, which includes all the obligatory festive-flavoured lattes.
For anyone that usually brings a reusable mug but wants to treat themselves to a one-off festive design instead, you can still recycle Costa's special edition versions, just make sure you bring the old cup back to your local store and they make sure they're taken to the correct recycling depot.


Christmas has officially arrived at Costa

 
Thankfully, the early launch means you have a full two months to try out all the flavours, with all the classic favourites making a comeback for 2019 - and you can choose whether you want them in coffee or hot chocolate form.
Costa Coffee’s famous Gingerbread Latte is back, giving a festive twist to the classic latte with the addition of gingerbread syrup and a cheeky, mini gingerbread man placed atop of the drink ready for his close-up on Instagram , setting you back £3.30, or £3.35 if you opt for hot chocolate.


Which is your favourite?

For those looking for something smooth and nutty, the Hazelnut Praline Latte has also returned for a second year, featuring coffee poured over a layer of chocolate and blended with rich hazelnut syrup, before being topped with cream and sprinkled with a chocolate toffee crumb, also £3.30 for the coffee version and £3.35 as a hot chocolate.
A Black Forest and Cream hot chocolate also joins the line-up, where indulgent, creamy chocolate meets sweet, tart cherry sauce for a matchmade in festive heaven, for £3.35.
