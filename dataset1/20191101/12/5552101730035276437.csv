民進黨青年競總成立　蔡英文籲年輕人都要投票
01 Nov 2019, 12:42 by 黃揚明, 林煒凱
民進黨今（1日）晚舉行明年大選青年競選總部開幕儀式活動，以「給台灣的一封信」為活動主題，總統蔡英文也到場「催票」，她強調，這次選舉的重點是「你要去投票」，因為很多人說年輕人不可靠，投票率不高，希望年輕人都要去投票，以行動把聲音撐大，讓國際社會知道台灣人選擇了民主與自由。
蔡英文說，很多人在笑民進黨，現在看起來好像很多年輕人支持，但年輕人不可靠，到時候可能睡過頭、懶惰，或要考試就不投票。他立刻問現場青年朋友：「所以這次做個可靠的年輕人，可以嗎？」現場群眾高喊：「可以！」
蔡英文說，年輕人在民進黨扮演重要角色，每個世代最關鍵的時刻出現的總是年輕人，年輕人出現時，也會在不知不覺中改變了民進黨與台灣。
蔡英文回憶，去年11月24日地方選後，很多人失望、不滿意，但現在發生了一件很重要的事，就是「年輕人站出來了」。她去拜廟時發現原本現場都是年紀大的群眾，但慢慢有年輕人出現，且越來越多，而民進黨有很多改變，動力就來自於年輕人站出來。
蔡英文說，台灣的選擇是民主自由，而沒有主權的民主、自由是沒保障的，香港的狀況一直倒退，就是因為沒有主權，民主、自由不是別人給，一定要握在自己的手上，就是2,300萬人共同擁有的主權，這就是2020年1月11日要講給全世界聽的「台灣人的選擇和價值」。
蔡英文坦言：「我今天其實是來催票的。」她介紹現場立委候選人時強調：「他們當選，我一定當選的啦！」她還說，在關鍵時刻改變國家命運的都是年輕人，「只要你覺得年輕，你就是改變台灣的關鍵所在。」
而蔡英文也展現冷笑話實力，她說：「你問我將來4年要做什麼？我將來4年要做總統啊！」她也認真地說，這4年她堅持改革，被很多人以很不堪的言語攻擊，但這是一個改革者必須承擔的。她也表示，包括婚姻平權、轉型正義、能源轉型、年金改革都做了，司法改革也已經進行，相信給她4年加上4年，會有一個台灣人可以信賴的司法。
民進黨副秘書長林飛帆朗讀他給台灣的一封信時提及，「台灣很美好，有人唱衰你，但我們不會，有人說你要發大財，但實際上你很富足，有人說他想要挖石油，但我們都知道，我們不要再挖山、也不要再挖海。」暗諷國民黨總統候選人韓國瑜意味濃厚。
林飛帆還說，現在是守護台灣最關鍵的時刻，「我們不會相信藍色，不會相信淡藍色，也不相信「白裡透紅」的不知道該怎麼說...」，但我們會堅定地踩在這塊綠色的土地上，幫助蔡英文守住國會、保護台灣。
民進黨祕書長羅文嘉說：「台灣，我們共同的母親，你不會孤單，因為會有一代又一代、一棒接一棒的年輕人站出來守護著你。」

民進黨主席卓榮泰主席朗讀前幽默表示，他和羅文嘉「介於年輕跟不年輕之間」，而這塊空地原本夜晚是黑暗的，前陣子因為搭帳棚開始有燈光，今天因為青年朋友到來更加明亮，希望這個明亮能一直持續到明年勝選那一天。
卓榮泰說，台灣短短400年歷史，記載許多外族人入侵的故事，也有無數前輩為了自由捨身奮鬥的故事，一直到30多年前才真正民主化，面臨邁向2020的十字路口，環境雖然艱困，但民進黨不會退縮，現在更將肩負重擔，成立青年競總，證明民進黨重視青年。
他也強調，這3年多來，台灣走在穩定改革的道路上，包括推動婚姻平權、年金改革等，民進黨承諾會給生活在這塊土地上的人們更大的幸福，民進黨會繼續成為台灣民主最堅定的捍衛者，無畏任何困難、打壓，勇往向前。

民進黨青年競選總部位於台北市杭州北路空地，民進黨中央黨部及蔡英文總統競選辦公室都在附近。青年競總搭建3個帳棚區域，分別是「進步號」、「世代共玩堂」、「民主大帳棚」，帳棚外廣場則搭建一個立法院議場的場景，象徵力拚國會過半。
除了蔡英文，這場活動也邀請台北市、新北市、桃園市以及新竹縣等地的民進黨青年立委候選人高嘉瑜、吳怡農、謝佩芬、許淑華、張銘祐、蔡沐霖、賴品妤、彭俊豪、周江杰、鄭朝方以及各縣市青年議員代表。包括卓榮泰在內的黨公職、青年參選人還與民主進步青年一同舞動，炒熱現場氣氛。

The Democratic Progressive Party’s Youth Competition was established. Cai Yingyu’s young people had to vote.
01 Nov 2019, 12:42 by Huang Yangming, Lin Yikai
The DPP held the opening ceremony of the Youth Election Campaign Headquarters next year on the 1st night. The theme of ""A Letter to Taiwan"" was held. President Tsai Ing-wen also attended the ""Reminder"". She emphasized that the focus of this election. It is ""you have to go to the polls"" because many people say that young people are unreliable and the voter turnout rate is not high. I hope that young people will go to vote and use their actions to expand their voices so that the international community knows that Taiwanese have chosen democracy and freedom.
Tsai Ing-wen said that many people are laughing at the DPP. It seems that many young people support it now, but young people are unreliable. They may overslept, be lazy, or not vote for the exam. He immediately asked the young friends on the scene: ""So this time, be a reliable young man, can you?"" The crowd shouted: ""Yes!""
Tsai Ing said that young people play an important role in the DPP. Young people appear at the most critical moments of every generation. When young people appear, they will unwittingly change the DPP and Taiwan.
Tsai Ing-wen recalled that after the local election on November 24 last year, many people were disappointed and dissatisfied, but now a very important thing happened, that is, ""the young people stood up."" When she went to worship the temple, she found that the original scene was old people, but slowly young people appeared and more and more, and the DPP had many changes, and the motivation came from the young people standing up.
Tsai Ing-wen said that Taiwan’s choice is democracy and freedom, and that there is no guarantee of sovereignty and freedom without sovereignty. The situation in Hong Kong has been retrogressive. It is because there is no sovereignty. Democracy and freedom are not given by others. They must be held in their own hands. It is the sovereignty of 23 million people. This is the ""Taiwanese choice and value"" to be heard to the world on January 11, 2020.
Tsai Ing said frankly: ""I actually came to the reminder today."" When she introduced the candidates for the legislators, she stressed: ""They are elected, I must be elected!"" She also said that it is young to change the fate of the country at a critical moment. People, ""As long as you feel young, you are the key to changing Taiwan.""
Tsai Ing-wen also showed the strength of the cold joke. She said, ""What do you want me to do in the next 4 years? I will be the president in the next 4 years!"" She also said seriously that she insisted on reforms for the past four years and was Very unspeakable speech attack, but this is a reformer must bear. She also said that including marriage equality, transformational justice, energy transformation, and annuity reform have been done, and judicial reform has been carried out. I believe that giving her four years plus four years will have a judicial system that Taiwanese can trust.
Lin Feifan, deputy secretary general of the DPP, read a letter to Taiwan and said, ""Taiwan is very beautiful. Some people sing you, but we don't. Some people say that you want to make a fortune, but in fact you are very rich. He said that he wants to dig oil, but we all know that we should not dig the mountain or dig the sea again."" The insinuation of the KMT’s presidential candidate, South Korea, is very meaningful.
Lin Feifan also said that now is the most crucial moment to protect Taiwan. ""We will not believe in blue, we will not believe in light blue, and we will not believe that ""white is red"". I don't know what to say..."", but we Will firmly step on this green land to help Tsai Ing-wen defend the Congress and protect Taiwan.
Luo Wenjia, secretary-general of the DPP, said: ""Taiwan, our common mother, you will not be alone, because there will be generations of young people who will stand up and guard you.""


Zhuo Rongtai, chairman of the DPP, danced with the young people of democracy and progress.

The chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party, Chairman Zhuo Rongtai, read aloud before he read that he and Luo Wenjia were ""between young and young"", and the empty space was dark in the night, and because of the tents, there was a light, today because The arrival of young friends is brighter, and I hope that this brightness will continue until the day of the election.
Zhuo Rongtai said that Taiwan’s short 400-year history records the stories of many foreigners’ invasions, and there are countless stories of predecessors fighting for freedom. They have only been democratized more than 30 years ago, facing a crossroads at 2020, although the environment Difficult, but the DPP will not back down, and now it will shoulder the burden, set up a youth competition, and prove that the DPP attaches importance to youth.
He also stressed that over the past three years, Taiwan has been on the road of stable reform, including promoting equal rights in marriage and annuity reform. The DPP has promised to give greater happiness to people living on this land. It will continue to be the most determined defender of Taiwan’s democracy, fearless of any difficulties, pressure, and move forward.


President Tsai Ing-wen attended the opening ceremony of the DPP Youth Competition and took photos with the guests and the young people attending the meeting.

The DPP Youth Campaign Headquarters is located in the open space of Hangzhou North Road in Taipei. The DPP Central Party Office and the Tsai In English Presidential Campaign Office are all nearby. The Youth Competition has set up three tented areas, namely, ""Progress"", ""Generation Play"" and ""Democratic Big Tent"". The square outside the tent is a scene of the Legislative Yuan, which symbolizes more than half of the Congress.
In addition to Tsai Ing-wen, the event also invited candidates from the Democratic Progressive Party Youth Committee of Taipei City, New Taipei City, Taoyuan City and Hsinchu County, Gao Jiayu, Wu Yinong, Xie Peifen, Xu Shuhua, Zhang Mingyou, Cai Mulin, Lai Pinzhen, Peng Junhao, Zhou Jiangjie. Zheng Chaofang and representatives of young city councilors from various counties and cities. Party public and youth candidates, including Zhuo Rongtai, also danced with the young people of democracy and progress, and sizzled the atmosphere.
