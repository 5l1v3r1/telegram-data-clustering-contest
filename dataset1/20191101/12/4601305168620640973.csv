There's nothing like snuggling up under a good blanket, especially when that blanket can snuggle you back. As the popularity of the Gravity Blanket testifies, there's more to a good bedcover than just soft material. These blankets incorporate subtle weights to create a swaddling effect that can ease you to sleep, and they're all on deep discount.

Gravity Travel Blanket: Gravity On-the-Go




There are tiny glass beads woven into the fabric of this innovative covering, making it dangerously easy to fall asleep under. And while its 66"" x 42"" dimensions make it more than big enough to bunk up under, the included travel bag makes it super portable.

MSRP: $185


Sale Price: $125


The Calm Embrace Weighted Blanket




Strategically-sized pockets on the Calm Embrace keep its glass nanobeads evenly distributed, which makes for a subtle, comforting fit. And the breathable cotton/polyester duvet cover gives it an extra dose of coziness.

MSRP: $249


Sale Price: $139


Bibb Home 10 Lb Weighted Blanket & Mink Cover




This versatile blanket features a mink cover that you can remove during hot summer nights and add back on for the winter chill. The well-distributed layer of non-toxic weighted beads makes this one suitable for sleepers between 100 and 140 pounds.
MSRP: $139
Sale Price: $95

BlanQuil™ Chill Cooling Weighted Blanket with Removable Cover




A lot went into the design of this one, from the baffling and weight distribution that delivers Deep Touch Stimulation therapy to the shift-resistant ties for the duvet cover. What's more, the special cotton-polyester blend disperses body heat to keep your temperature even throughout the night. Take your pick of packages and duvet colors.

MSRP: $209


Sale Price: $172


Home Collection Navy Weighted Blanket




Anyone would want to crawl into this mink blanket after a long day. But the lightweight added inside (8 lb.) makes it especially appealing if you need a little more comfort around bedtime. Take your pick of several colors, all 15% off the list price.
