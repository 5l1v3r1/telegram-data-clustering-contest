As if surprise new Earl Sweatshirt wasn’t exciting enough, we’re getting a new Wiki album next week. It’s called OOFIE and it comes out November 8 via Wiki’s own Wikset Enterprise, and along with the announcement Wiki released the new Tony Seltzer-produced single “Pesto.” It follows a string of great Wiki singles that began last year, and it’s on par with the best of them. No word if OOFIE will include any or all of those singles (like the Madlib-produced “Eggs”), but you’ll only have to wait seven days to find out. Stay tuned and watch the Matt Seger and Dexter Brierley-directed “Pesto” video below.
As mentioned, Wiki plays a hometown show this Saturday (11/2) at The Sultan Room, and he’ll be joined by Mr. Muthafuckin’ eXquire and Lansky Jones of World’s Fair. Tickets are still available. Wiki is also promising to announce an all ages hometown show after this.
