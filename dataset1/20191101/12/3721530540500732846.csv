BlizzCon 2019 kicks off Friday, Nov. 1 at 11 a.m. PT / 2 p.m. ET with the fan gathering’s opening ceremony. Blizzard Entertainment is expected to make major reveals such as Overwatch 2, Diablo 4, and World of Warcraft: Shadowlands, all of which have leaked in various forms. You can watch BlizzCon 2019’s opening ceremony live, right here, via YouTube.
The opening ceremony for BlizzCon 2019 will also stream on Blizzard’s Twitch channel, and if you want to watch more of the show from afar, you’ll need to purchase a BlizzCon Virtual Ticket. That all-access pass costs $49.99 and includes a variety of in-game goods for Overwatch, StarCraft 2, World of Warcraft, and other Blizzard games.
Beyond new game reveals, we should also expect some updates to Blizzard’s other games, such as Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm, and hopefully an update on last year’s most contentious game reveal, Diablo: Immortal. Perhaps we’ll hear more about some of Blizzard’s other projects, like the rumored Diablo animated series, a potential Diablo 2 remaster, and the future of the Overwatch League.
It’s sure to be one of the biggest, most interesting BlizzCon events ever — for a variety of reasons.
For a rundown of the BlizzCon 2019 schedule, you can find that at Blizzard’s official website.
