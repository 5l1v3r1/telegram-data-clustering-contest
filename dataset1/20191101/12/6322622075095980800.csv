首要媒体：受重组影响的员工将获公平补偿
01 Nov 2019, 12:49 by Ahmad Naqib Idris
（吉隆坡1日讯）首要媒体（Media Prima Bhd）将开始下一阶段的商业转型活动，所有受影响的员工将获得公平与公正的补偿方案。
这证实了TheEdgeMarkets今日稍早的报导，指该公司正在考虑新一轮的裁员。
首要媒体在文告中表示：“这包括改变商业模式和内部重组，以在不确定的宏观经济状况以及全球和本地媒体领域颠覆性变化的情况下，使集团适应未来发展和可持续发展。”
首要媒体预计，将于2020年首季完成重组活动，并指将依据所有法律要求，全额支付给受影响的员工。它还将向员工提供支持，包括工作安置服务和职业咨询。
“全球媒体格局继续以迅速的步伐和规模迅速变化，要求媒体公司审查并颠覆自身的商业模式，以保持可持续性和成功。”
“展望未来，集团将继续致力于为员工、客户、股东和利益相关者带来价值。
这意味着首要媒体进行第二轮裁员。
去年11月，首要媒体旗下经营免费电视台TV3的Sistem Televisyen Malaysia Bhd向190名职员发出3个月的裁员通知，同时向另外43名职员提供互惠离职方案（MSS）。
随着与商业大亨丹斯里赛莫达相关的Aurora Mulia私人有限公司，于今年9月收购该媒体集团的8829万股或7.9%股权后，首要媒体进行业务合理化。
Aurora于10月8日增持750万股，使持股权达到31.898%。
该投资工具还收购了Dilof私人有限公司的70%股权，后者在马来前锋报（Utusan Melayu (M) Bhd）关闭后，拥有《Utusan Malaysia》及《Kosmo!》的出版准证和档案。Dilof之后改名为Media Mulia私人有限公司。
截至今年6月杪第二季（2019财年第二季），首要媒体净亏883万令吉，为连续第二个季度蒙亏，归因于传统业务如出版和电视网络的贡献走低。
该集团自2016财年第三季以来，除了2016财年末季、2018财年次季和2018财年末季之外，均出现季度亏损。
闭市时，首要媒体跌1仙或2.74%，至35.5仙，写下5个月新低记录，市值为3亿9377万令吉。

Primary media: employees affected by the restructuring will receive fair compensation
01 Nov 2019, 12:49 by Ahmad Naqib Idris
(Kuala Lumpur, 1st) The Media Prima Bhd will begin the next phase of business transformation, and all affected employees will receive a fair and equitable compensation package.
This confirms that TheEdgeMarkets reported earlier today that the company is considering a new round of layoffs.
The premier media said in the statement: “This includes changing business models and internal restructuring to adapt the group to future growth and sustainable development in the face of uncertain macroeconomic conditions and disruptive changes in global and local media.”
The premier media expects to complete the restructuring activities in the first quarter of 2020, and will pay the full amount to the affected employees in accordance with all legal requirements. It will also provide support to employees, including job placement services and career counseling.
“The global media landscape continues to change rapidly at a rapid pace and scale, requiring media companies to review and subvert their business models to remain sustainable and successful.”
“Looking ahead, the Group will continue to focus on bringing value to employees, customers, shareholders and stakeholders.
This means that the primary media will make a second round of layoffs.
In November last year, Sistem Televisyen Malaysia Bhd, the chief media operator of free TV station TV3, issued a three-month notice of layoffs to 190 employees and a reciprocal resignation program (MSS) to another 43 employees.
Aurora Mulia Sdn Bhd, which is related to commercial tycoon Tan Sri Semoda, after the acquisition of 88.29 million shares or 7.9% of the media group in September this year, the primary media to rationalize the business.
Aurora increased its holdings of 7.5 million shares on October 8, bringing the shareholding to 31.898%.
The investment vehicle also acquired a 70% stake in Dilof Sdn Bhd, which has a publishing permit and file for Utusan Malaysia and Kosmo! after the closure of Utusan Melayu (M) Bhd. Dilof was later renamed Media Mulia Sdn Bhd.
As of the second quarter of June this year (second quarter of FY 2019), the primary media had a net loss of RM8.83 million, which was the second consecutive quarter of losses, due to lower contributions from traditional businesses such as publishing and television networks.
Since the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the group has suffered quarterly losses in addition to the 2016 fiscal year ending quarter, the 2018 fiscal year second quarter and the end of the 2018 financial year.
At the close of the market, the primary media fell 1 sen or 2.74% to 35.5 sen, writing a five-month low record with a market capitalization of RM 937.37 million.
