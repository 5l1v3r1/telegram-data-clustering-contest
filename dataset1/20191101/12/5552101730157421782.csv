135億打造台版環球影城　魏德聖重現400年前台灣樣貌
01 Nov 2019, 12:56 by 熊景玉
《海角七号》、《賽德克巴萊》導演魏德聖及其團隊籌備多年的「臺灣三部曲歷史文化園區BOT案」，今（11/1）日正式於臺南市政府民治市政中心1樓大廳舉辦簽約記者會，記者會現場釋出多張園區概念氛圍圖及幕後影片，讓期盼已久的影迷們一睹為快。
魏德聖計畫將他策畫多年的《臺灣三部曲》電影與立化園區結合，「臺灣三部曲歷史文化園區」則將座落於台南市後壁區烏樹林，緊鄰臺灣蘭花生物科技園區，廣達118公頃的園區範圍，將規劃一片海洋（台江內海）、二座城堡（熱蘭遮城、普羅民遮城）、三種文化（西拉雅人、漢人、荷蘭人）、四個主題村（熱蘭遮海陸市鎮、赤崁漢人移墾聚落、海盜村、西拉雅原住民部落），在此並將完成五部影片。其中策畫多年的《臺灣三部曲》，將以3個共時故事同步拍攝出3部電影，分別以西拉雅獵人、漢人海盜與荷蘭傳教士的角度開展，透過不同觀點的詮釋，構成一組史詩鉅作。目前電影前製作業正如火如荼進行中，預計在2021年下半年正式開鏡。
由於3部電影將會同時拍攝，這也是魏德聖導演首次嘗試主場景「邊蓋邊拍」的拍攝模式。負責場景設計的日本美術團隊表示，故事背景的時代久遠，能夠參考的歷史資料相當有限，再加上這次的「搭景」是需要被留存作為園區的永久性建築，這樣的計畫在日本也是前所未見，挑戰性十足。配合劇本需求，許多場景都需採實景拍攝，因此除了臺灣本島外，場景範圍將擴大至金門、澎湖，甚至還會到日本沖繩諸島及歐洲的荷蘭，規模相當浩大。

魏德聖更大的野心則在於打造「臺灣三部曲歷史文化園區」，目前設計已同步在進行。結合電影主題，園區將分別規劃出歐式風情的熱蘭遮海陸市鎮，讓遊客重溫「臺灣第一城」的風貌，體驗東、西文化的撞擊；自然原始的西拉雅原住民村落，集結南島語族海洋文化，搭配展現自然生態的親水體驗，適合熱愛挑戰的大小朋友；充滿庶民文化的赤崁漢人聚落，除讓外國遊客一覽最具「異國風情」的傳統民俗活動外，重新還原建造的普羅民遮城（今赤崁樓前身），也是一大亮點；展現古代海盜工藝技術的海盜村，遊客除了能近距離欣賞職人們的專業技術，還可以親自打造出專屬的工藝品。

園區內也將規劃獨特主題的表演秀，結合科技藝術與五感技術，帶領遊客身歷其境走進電影故事裡，搖身一變成17世紀的人物角色。4個主題鮮明的區域，加上運用最新技術的設施與表演，將開創旅遊產業的新格局，打造出世界獨一無二的主題公園。
魏德聖導演在記者會上表示，拍電影最擔心的是土地的問題，「市府在這方面給了很大的幫助，讓我們在土地上很多條件都比其他案子來得好，再加上行政院去年把案子核定為政府重大建設，也讓投資人更有信心參與。」本案總投資規模預估將高達新臺幣135億元，是《賽德克・巴萊》的數十倍之多。

對此魏導表示，這一次要做的不是短期的電影場景，而是「回到『世界走進臺灣、臺灣迎向世界』的開端」，將400年前臺灣的樣貌重現，並且讓其能永遠存留在這塊土地，成為一座永續經營的主題公園，因此成本確實不能同日而語。他期待這座因為臺灣故事與文化而誕生的主題公園，能讓海內外的遊客以不同的方式認識臺灣。
魏德聖說：「與其他的開發案和主題遊樂園不同，我們就像嘉南平原的農民一樣，這次我們種下的是歷史文化的種子，這顆種子來自400年前的臺灣，希望能夠跟著臺灣的世世代代越來越豐富精彩。」

Among them, the ""Taiwan Trilogy"", which has been planned for many years, will simultaneously shoot three movies in three synchronic stories, which are carried out by the perspective of the Silaya hunters, the Han pirates and the Dutch missionaries, and through the interpretation of different viewpoints. Group epic masterpieces. At present, the pre-production of the film is in full swing and is expected to officially open in the second half of 2021.
Since the three films will be filmed at the same time, this is the first time that Director Wei Desheng has tried the shooting mode of the main scene ""Blade and Shoot"". The Japanese art team responsible for the scene design said that the age of the story background is long and the historical materials that can be referenced are quite limited. In addition, this ""landscape"" is a permanent building that needs to be retained as a park. Such a plan is also in Japan. Unprecedented and challenging. In line with the needs of the script, many scenes need to be photographed in real time. Therefore, in addition to Taiwan's main island, the scene will be extended to Kinmen and Wuhu, and even to the Okinawa Islands in Japan and the Netherlands in Europe.

In combination with the theme of the film, the park will separately plan the European-style hotland to cover the land of the city, allowing visitors to relive the ""Taiwan's first city"" style and experience the impact of Eastern and Western culture; the natural original Silaya indigenous village, It is a combination of the South Island language marine culture and the hydrophilic experience of natural ecology. It is suitable for friends who love challenges. The Akasaka Han people who are full of people's culture are re-constructed in addition to the traditional “exotic” traditional folk activities. The Promenade of the Promenade (now the predecessor of Akasaka House) is also a highlight; the pirate village that displays the ancient pirate craftsmanship, in addition to being able to appreciate the professional skills of the staff, can also personally create exclusive crafts.

The four distinctive areas, combined with the latest technology facilities and performances, will create a new landscape of the tourism industry and create a unique theme park in the world.
Director Wei Desheng said at the press conference that the biggest concern about making movies is the problem of land. ""The city has given a lot of help in this respect. Let us have many conditions on the land better than other cases, plus the Executive Yuan. Last year, the case was approved as a major government construction, and investors were more confident to participate. The total investment scale of this case is estimated to be as high as NT$13.5 billion, which is dozens of times more than “Sidek Bale”.

He is looking forward to this theme park, which was born because of Taiwan's story and culture, and allows visitors at home and abroad to know Taiwan in different ways.
Wei Desheng said: ""Unlike other developments and theme parks, we are like farmers in the Canaan Plain. This time we planted the seeds of history and culture. This seed comes from Taiwan 400 years ago and hopes to follow Taiwan. The generations have become more and more exciting.""
