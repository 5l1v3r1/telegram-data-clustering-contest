BOSTON (AP) - A high-ranking member of the Outlaws Motorcycle Club from Massachusetts has been charged with illegal possession of a gun.
Federal prosecutors say 48-year-old Bruce Sartwell was held after his initial court appearance Wednesday pending a detention hearing scheduled for Friday.
Sartwell, who according to authorities is the regional president of the Brockton/East Bridgewater Chapter of the Outlaws, was arrested after authorities say they found an AR-15 style ""ghost gun"" at his East Bridgewater home. A ""ghost gun"" is a firearm without any manufacturing or serial numbers.
As a previously convicted felon, he is not allowed to possess guns.
According to a Department of Homeland Security affidavit, the Outlaws are currently involved in a ""violent feud"" with the Hells Angels.
Sartwell's public defender declined comment.
