01 Nov 2019, 12:39

Cape Town – Put on your bok jersey and support the boys in their bid to bring home the Web Ellis Cup.
But there isn’t only sport to entertain you this weekend on the small and big screens.
We have your viewing sorted with our handy guide – here are our top recommendations.

1) Sanditon


Friday, 1 November

20:00 - BBC First (DStv 119)
This historical period drama was adapted from an unfinished manuscript by Jane Austen. The original work sets the scene in the first episode, then the story takes on a life of its own. It follows Charlotte Heywood, who comes to stay as a guest in the Parker household in the fishing village of Sanditon. She soon discovers that the inhabitants of the town behave in curious and unpredictable ways. Spirited and unconventional, Charlotte is keen to experience everything the town has to offer.




2) Rugby World Cup Final


Saturday, 2 November

09:15 – SuperSport (DStv 201)
Boks target third RWC triumph! The nerves are at an ultimate high as South Africans brace for an epic 2019 Rugby World Cup Final that sees coach Rassie Erasmus’ Springboks take on England at the Yokohama International Stadium. Captain Siya Kolisi will lead his troops on Saturday while also bagging a milestone 50th test cap in the Green and Gold. 




3) The College Admissions Scandal


Saturday, 2 November

19:20 - Lifetime (DStv 131)
A ripped from the headlines feature. The film centres on the scheme in which up to 50 wealthy parents allegedly bribed college coaches and other insiders to get their children into some of the nation's most selective schools. Two wealthy mothers share an obsession with getting their teenagers into the best possible college.




4) The Deuce



Showmax


Bringing the Emmy-winning series to a conclusion, the third season takes us back to 1985. VHS has become the primary medium for pornography, and the AIDS epidemic has changed the industry. With the party of the 1970s winding down, barkeeps, prostitutes, pimps, police, mobsters, porn actors and producers take us on a gripping journey into the sleaziest corners of Times Square. The series stars James Franco, Maggie Gyllenhaal and David Simon.




5) Prank Encounters



Netflix


Hosted by Gaten Matarazzo (Stranger Things), each episode of this terrifying and hilarious prank show takes two complete strangers on the surprise ride of a lifetime. It's business as usual until their paths collide and their one-day assignments turn into supernatural surprises. Where fear meets funny, Prank Encounters is the most elaborate hidden camera prank show ever devised.




NOW SHOWING IN CINEMAS

A quarter century since Sarah Conner and the T-800 saved the world from Skynet in Terminator 2: Judgement Day, another young woman, Dani Ramos, holds the key to the future fight against the machines. (READ OUR REVIEW HERE)
