「國際復康日」合資格人士及1位同行照顧者可免費搭巴士
被網民稱為「黨鐵」的港鐵，近日頻頻更改服務時間，不時提早收車、「飛站」或暫停服務，今日（11月1日）港鐵各線（機場快線除外）、輕鐵及港鐵巴士服務，將於晚上11時結束，近期要出外的話，搭巴士似乎是個更好選擇。九巴及龍運巴士宣布將在2019年 11月10日（星期日）由香港社會服務聯會主辦的「國際復康日」，為合資格人士及其一位同行照顧者提供免費乘車優惠。
凡持有「殘疾人士登記證」或使用註有「殘疾人士身分」個人八達通卡的人士，及一位與持證人士同行的照顧者，可免費乘搭任何九巴及龍運路線（包括機場路線）。「殘疾人士登記證」持有人上車時只需出示該證件，而使用註有「殘疾人士身分」個人八達通卡的人士則必須拍卡，當日該八達通卡所扣除的車資將設定為$0。
