沃爾瑪2019黑五促銷提前開始了？

01 Nov 2019, 12:44

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】你在尋找黑色星期五打折甩賣嗎？第一個參與其中的最大零售商沃爾瑪（Walmart）已經啟動了，很難將其看真正的黑五交易，因其已於為10月下旬推出。不過，這些交易不錯，從中能夠看出接下來黑五的價格跡象。
目前最好的價格包括：蘋果手錶系列3（GPS + LTE，38mm）、Xbox One S遊戲機、第六代iPad，以及其它。
蘋果手錶系列3（GPS + LTE，38毫米）是229美元，這與亞馬遜目前的價格相當，但沃爾瑪還包括一個免費的Motile 5，200mAh電源，可以為智能手錶無線充電。
沃爾瑪的蘋果手錶系列4（GPS + LTE，44mm）價格是429美元，比系列3高出200美元。但如果你更喜歡這些功能的話，還是值得考慮的：系列4更大、更快、並有跌倒檢測和支持EKG，並且是蘋果的新設計（類似於今年的5系列機型）。
還有一個，就是1TB的微軟Xbox One S，售價249美元，還附送遊戲《使命召喚：現代戰爭》（Call of Duty: Modern Warfare）。沃爾瑪還有幾種不同的主控台捆綁包可選擇，除了一個免費的COD副本之外，還包含不同的免費遊戲（如NBA 2K20、戰爭齒輪5，或戰場V）。
擁有128GB內部存儲空間的第六代iPad目前售價為299美元，這比過去的價格下降大約30美元，包括去年的黑五。與最新的第七代iPad相比，這款打折機型的螢幕更小（9.7英寸對10.2英寸），而且缺少一個智能鍵盤連接器。不過，六代iPad採用了相同的A10處理器，也支援蘋果鉛筆。與七代iPad相比，便宜了100美元，而且存儲空間足夠大，還是很划算。

Wal-Mart 2019 Black Five Promotion started ahead of schedule?

01 Nov 2019, 12:44

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 01, 2019] Are you looking for a black Friday discount sale? Walmart, the first major retailer to participate in it, has already started, and it is difficult to see it as a real Black Friday deal, as it was launched in late October. However, these transactions are good, from which we can see the price signs of the next black five.
The best prices currently include: Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS + LTE, 38mm), Xbox One S, Sixth Generation iPad, and more.
The Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS + LTE, 38mm) is $229, which is comparable to Amazon's current price, but Wal-Mart also includes a free Motile 5, 200mAh power supply that can wirelessly charge smart watches.
Wal-Mart's Apple Watch Series 4 (GPS + LTE, 44mm) is priced at $429, which is $200 higher than Series 3. But if you prefer these features, it's worth considering: Series 4 is bigger, faster, has fall detection and support for EKG, and is Apple's new design (similar to this year's 5 series models).
There is also a 1TB Microsoft Xbox One S, priced at $ 249, with the game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Wal-Mart also has several different console bundles to choose from, in addition to a free COD copy, it also includes different free games (such as NBA 2K20, War Gear 5, or Battlefield V).
The sixth-generation iPad with 128GB of internal storage is currently priced at $299, which is about $30 less than the previous price, including last year's Black Five. Compared to the latest seventh-generation iPad, this discounted model has a smaller screen (9.7 inches vs. 10.2 inches) and lacks a smart keyboard connector. However, the six-generation iPad uses the same A10 processor and also supports Apple Pencil. Compared with the 7th generation iPad, it is 100 dollars cheaper, and the storage space is large enough, it is still very cost-effective.
