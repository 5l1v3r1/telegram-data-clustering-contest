【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】魏德聖導演31日出席公益活動，分享8月前往緬甸甘蔗（Kyangin）田計劃區關懷兒童人權，讓憧憬當飛行員的小男孩體驗玩空拍機，吸引所有同學看，「孩子的夢要讓他親身體驗，才會知道需要具備什麼樣的知識。」接著笑說：「反正不是我的（器材），但是攝影師一直冒冷汗」。

當地生活貧困、設施堪憂，但魏德聖仍表示感動與收穫，「孩子們在這裡快樂地學習，對未來帶著龐大的夢，然而這樣的環境難以提供它們足夠的養分。夢很漂亮，聽在大人的耳裡卻有些心酸。」他在夢想樹上，許下「願所有孩子的夢都成真。」
魏導在學齡前幼兒中心化身幼教老師，為孩子們上了一堂「認識台灣」，他一筆畫出台灣的輪廓，一個小男孩舉手笑說：「好像雞腿！」他說：「台灣是一座島，長得像地瓜，被水圍繞，也像一名母親抱著一個孩子，所以台灣是一個愛孩子的媽媽的島。」

觀賞戲劇表演後，魏導與青少年對談，發現除了受保護，也需要提升孩子的參與權，免於打黑工、遭受家暴，「孩子對未來有夢，是一個村落、一個國家最大的希望。」
