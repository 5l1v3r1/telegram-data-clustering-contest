All-female spacewalk crew make history
01 Nov 2019, 13:24 by Louise Miner



Euronews space correspondent and European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Luca Parmitano has sent the latest installment of Space Chronicles, a series in which he documents his experiences on the International Space Station (ISS) over a six-month period.
Luca Parmitano, European Space Agency (ESA) Astronaut said, ""What a week to be the commander of the International Space Station!""
""My two amazing colleagues, Christina and Jessica, made history by performing a contingency EVA (Extravehicular Activity) with an all-female crew for the first time. In just a few days my colleagues and I received instructions from the ground on how to perform an unplanned EVA.""
""Drew was the main IV, I was the assistant. Jessica and Christina were the EVS (Earth (Science) Venture Class Sub-orbital projects), going outside, and then I was the operator number 1 for the robotic arm. A new experience for me as well where I was moving Christina on the arm from one part of the Space Station to another.""
A very delicate role for all of us, so we are very happy and satisfied that everything went well, the Space Station is back in a good configuration, and we are ready to keep going for Mission Beyond, Expedition 61, the great science, technology and exploration that awaits us.""

In collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA).
