Kendall Jenner had her first birthday celebration last night, putting on a major Halloween costume party for her friends. The model will turn 24 on November 3 and teased that she was ""keeping the halloween birthday party alive for mom,"" before the party on her Instagram.
Kendall shared several Instagrams of her A-list guests partying with her and revealed their costumes. Kacey Musgraves, Gigi and Bella Hadid, Hailey Baldwin, Emily Ratajkowski, and Kylie Jenner were among the company. Emily Ratajkowski also attended, along with Caitlyn Jenner, who dressed up as a vampire.
What was Kendall for this party? She had very fancy gold fairy vibes going on:

Gigi Hadid did her best take on Jim Carrey's The Mask character, and it was a very good take:

Bella Hadid was Catwoman:

Hailey Baldwin was a real throwback: Lola Bunny from Space Jam:

Kourtney Kardashian was a cow girl while Kacey Musgraves was a Dallas Cowboy cheerleader:






Instagram


Emily Ratajkowski and her husband Sebastian Bear-Mcclard channeled characters from The Sopranos. Emrata was Carmela:



Instagram


Jaden Smith was also there as Tyler the Creator, and fans are convinced Blackpink's Jennie was hanging right alongside him, channeling Alice from Alice in Wonderland:






Kendall's party had all the Kardashian-Jenner birthday party staples, including a personalized photo booth for Kenny's 24th.



There was also cake and servers dressed up like Kendall in her Versace Met Gala 2019 dress. Because if there's any occasion it's appropriate to ask the world to dress like you, it's your birthday.
