Preview
The Highlanders are coming after a hard-fought draw against champions Bengaluru FC away from home and a win against ISL new entrants Odisha FC. Meanwhile, the Gaurs are marching into Guwahati with the same four points as the Highlanders. The in-from Goan side has thrashed Chennaiyin FC in their first match and drew with Bengaluru, but they have injuries to their key foreign players. It will be a match of equal powers and NorthEast United have a slight advantage with its home support and an injury-less side.
Key Players
NEUFC’s striker Asamoah Gyan is one of the best players in this ISL. He has scored against Odisha FC and has struck the woodwork in the previous game. The Ghanian all-time top scorer is supported by Indian midfielder Redeem Thang, who scored a quick goal against Odisha.
Foreigners Panagiotis Triadis is also a crucial player for NorthEast at the midfield and he has been ably supported by captain Jose Leudo, who will be crucial in marking Coro. 
For the Gaurs, undoubtedly, Coro will be the man to lead the attacks. The all-time ISL top scorer will be supported by Indians Len Doungel and Jackichand Singh at the wings. Goalkeeper Muhammed Nawaz is also in good form for the Goan side. Foreign defenders Mourtada Fall and Carlos Pena will coordinate the defensive duties.
Team News
Robert Jarni has a fit squad to choose from, a luxury other ISL teams hardly have.  However, Uruguayan midfielder Federico Gallego is injured and ruled out, which has been a huge loss.
On the other side, Goa has injuries to their key foreign players  Edu Bedia and Hugo Boumous is still doubtful for the match, although Spanish coach Lobera didn’t seem worried.
Head to Head
Both teams faced 10 times and FC Goa have won more with 4 wins. NorthEast United could only manage two wins and the rest four went to draw.
Form Guide
NorthEast United FC: W D L W D
FC Goa: D W L L W
Predicted Eleven
