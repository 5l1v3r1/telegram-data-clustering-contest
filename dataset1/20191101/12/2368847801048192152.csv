【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】韓國人氣男團MONSTA X所屬經紀公司STARSHIP娛樂昨天宣布，近日因各種傳聞陷入爭議的元虎（Wonho，李虎錫）與公司商議後決定即日起退出MONSTA X。今天（1日），公司又宣布本日與元虎解除合約。
近日元虎遭網紅鄭多恩指控行竊與欠錢未還，今日韓媒「Dispatch（俗稱D社）」又報導鄭多恩透露曾於2013年與元虎吸食非法藥物。報導稱，MONSTA X在9月結束德國演出回到韓國之際，警方曾在仁川機場取得元虎的毛髮進行毒品檢測。
今日下午，STARSHIP娛樂回應此報導內容，表示元虎當時確實在機場接受了隨身行李檢查和身體檢查，但只是海關檢查的一部分，並未被告知有調查其他內容，而公司對於元虎2013年疑似涉及使用違法藥物一事、以及與此相關的調查毫不知情。
STARSHIP娛樂表示，由於本次的相關事件，已無法與元虎維持合約關係，因此公司與元虎於2019年11月1日解除合約。聲明也表示，對於本次事件讓眾人擔心，公司感到責任重大，將會誠實面對調查，努力將義務盡到最後，同時也向喜愛MONSTA X的粉絲致歉。
