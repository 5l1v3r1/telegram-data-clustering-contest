NBA庫里左手骨折 缺戰時間未明

01 Nov 2019, 12:38

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】NBA金州勇士31日對戰鳳凰城太陽，勇士主將庫里（Stephen Curry）驚傳左手骨折，據隨隊記者向勇士總管麥爾斯（Bob Myers）求證，麥爾斯指出，會再藉由斷層掃描決定庫里是否需動手術，目前尚無法得知庫里會缺賽多久。

勇士一開賽便遭太陽火力攻擊，第一節結束太陽以43：14大幅領先；第二節勇士頻頻追分，半場結束仍由太陽以72：46握有優勢。賽事進行到第三節，庫里上籃造成中鋒拜恩斯（Aron Baynes）犯規，隨後拜恩斯倒下壓到庫里左手，庫里隨即退場接受檢查，確定為左手骨折。
雖然終場勇士以110：121不敵太陽，差距僅有11分，但在湯普森（Klay Thompson）、魯尼（Kevon Looney）、庫里皆受傷的情況下，戰力可說是極為不妙。
