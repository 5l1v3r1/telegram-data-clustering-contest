01 Nov 2019, 12:24 by 鞠豪傑 Jet Chu, 游銘元
第46屆東京車展（Tokyo Motor Show 2019，TMS 2019，10/25~11/04雖然與其他國際大型車展一樣，面臨著參展廠商不斷抽腿的窘境，但在主辦單位JAMA日本汽車製造商協會的努力、以及地主隊日系車廠的力挺之下，此次東京車展是史上規模最大！而在此次車展中亦全球首發了多種全新量產與原型車款，動力方式涵蓋了純油、油電與純電，其中更有多款極有可能引進台灣銷售，有興趣嗎？請看我們的現場直擊報導！
有人問我現在資訊以光速傳達，新車資訊在布幕揭起的同時，網路就即刻同步公開，為何還要大費周章的跑去日本？我說，你看到的只是一堆資訊和冷冰冰的影像，但當我置身於2019年東京車展的現場時，感受到的不只是汽車大國的文化底蘊，還有那紮根於每個人、對於車輛的愛情與熱情！

小鴨變悍鴨　
TOYOTA Yaris 大改款


全新大改款Yaris意外的沒在TOYOTA展館現身，但在隔壁的百貨公司卻幸運的可以見到其本尊。

或許是豐田章男社長在公開賽道測試新 Corolla 的影片中不小心「官洩」，TOYOTA只好趕在東京車展前搶先發佈了新一代大改款Yaris的全貌及規格數據。新一代Yaris採用了TNGA家族中最新的GA-B 小型車模組化平台，其訴求為高剛性、輕量化與低重心，整體車重更較上一代車款減輕了50公斤。尺寸上新一代Yaris與現行款相比，長寬高為3,940mm（-5mm） x 1,695mm（+50mm） x 1,500mm（-40mm），但軸距卻反而增加50mm來到了2,560mm，帶來的是更好的乘坐舒適性與動態表現。


3D立體構造的車尾燈組。

以「B-Dash！」為概念的全新造型設計，讓新一代Yaris更為凶悍，銳利的頭燈與Two Tone的車頭與車頂，整體的躍動感及活力感大增，加上3D立體構造的車尾燈組，早已非之前的都會通勤乖乖車樣貌。


銳利的頭燈與Two Tone的車頭與車頂，整體的躍動感及活力感大增。

動力上新一代Yaris亦全面更新！共有1.5 升直列三缸 Dynamic 自然進氣引擎、1.0 升直列三缸自然進氣引擎、新一代1.5 升油電系統三種配置。其中1.5 升三缸 Dynamic自然進氣引擎採用了豐田的最新科技，具備缸內直噴、高速燃燒技術、長衝程與更大的氣門角度，擁有大馬力及低油耗的特點，匹配同樣也是新技術的Direct Shift-CVT變速箱，在駕馭樂趣上肯定是跨越世代的全新感受！新一代Yaris日規版本預計 2020 年 2 月會於日本上市，台灣引進的時程則未定。

TOYOTA展館充滿了簡約的未來感。

RAV4舍弟
DAIHATSU 新款小型SUV


DAIHATSU 新款小型SUV外型乍看之下竟與TOYOTA五代RAV4神似！

TOYOTA 旗下的DAIHATSU自創立以來就以小車專家自居，除了在日本國內的K-Car市場有著極高的市佔率之外，經典的Terios「小悍馬」更是許多四驅車玩家的首選。全新的DAIHATSU 新款小型SUV採用衍生自TNGA平台的「DNGA」平台，外型乍看之下與TOYOTA的五代RAV4甚至還頗為神似！但從其高聳的離地高與大量使用的防刮材質，可以看出其傳承了Terios的優異越野能力。車身尺寸為長3,995mm、寬 1,695mm、高 1,620mm，軸距 2,525mm，讓人驚異的是其車重僅 980 公斤，所以駕馭起來應該十分輕巧。


車尾設計還算中規中矩。



內裝設計也很像五代RAV4。

動力部分則採用了同集團的1.0升 三缸渦輪增壓引擎，搭配CVT 變速箱，可輸出98匹馬力與14.3 kgm扭力。話說雖然DAIHATSU目前幾乎已不製造左駕車款，不過老大哥TOYOTA卻以此車為藍本推出雙生車Raize，預定11月5日正式在日本發表，之後出左駕海外版的機率大增！而有鑑於NISSAN Kicks與HONDA HR-V在台灣的熱銷，和泰汽車引進的機率應該不算太低，但會是進口或是國產則還要再觀察。

全方位攻略
HONDA Fit大改款


第四代Fit依然不脫其溫良恭儉讓的內斂風格，甚至還有幾分Honda e的影子。

作為HONDA暢銷全球的主力小車，第四代Fit的動向在展前一直受到全球本田粉矚目，所以在東京車展正式發表時現場幾乎被全球媒體擠爆！全新四代Fit也沒辜負大家的期待，共發表了多達五種車型，從入門款標配15吋胎圈的 Basic、然後就是全部標配16吋胎圈的 Home、Ness、Crosstar 與 Luxe Trim，動力單元從傳統燃油引擎到油電動力都有。詳細的動力配置雖然尚未公布，但預計可能是日規現行版的1.5升Earth Dream缸內直噴汽油引擎、與最新一代名為「e:HEV」的油電混和動力系統。


尾燈採用立體式設計，此車為Crosstar跨界版本。

外觀上第四代Fit依然不脫其溫良恭儉讓的內斂風格，圓潤與方正線條交互使用，車頭與大燈甚至還有幾分Honda e的影子，符合其新一代家族Look。個人覺得新一代Fit的整體感看起來更為中性，也符合其通用型掀背車的大眾化需求。不過我的本田鐵粉朋友倒是個個哀號，似乎不太能接受帶一點「萌」感的第四代Fit外觀。

更為科技與人性化的駕駛介面也是第四代Fit的重點。液晶儀表板與大型中控液晶觸控螢幕讓車上幾乎找不到傳統儀表，空調外的所有設定都經由方向盤兩側按鍵與中控液晶螢幕來操作，也因此整個駕駛介面更為簡潔，不過傳統的排檔桿則獲得了保留，手煞車也改為EPB 電子手煞車（但傳出有瑕疵所以可能會影響上市時程）。更細的A柱與更大的前檔側三角窗消彌大部分轉向死角，然後雨刷也完全隱藏在前檔的下緣，讓駕駛的視野更為寬闊。另外除了Honda Sensing智慧安全主動防護系統之外，最新的 Honda Connect 車載智慧行動裝置也將全面標配。第四代Fit預計將於2020年2月於日本正式銷售，台灣引進時機則尚不明朗。


四代Fit首次採用雙翼式方向盤。



HONDA展館同時展示汽車與機車。

純電入魂　
MAZDA MX-30


MX-30採用了新一代Kodo 魂動設計，家族化風格明確。

謠傳已久的MAZDA純電車款終於在本屆東京車展現身！就如同眾多媒體的預測般，這款純電車是一款CUV跨界休旅車，而且還被MAZDA賦予了「MX-30」款式名稱，雖然此舉讓MX-5的車主們一片哀嘆，但也顯示了MAZDA對於此純電車款的明確定位。MX-30在尺寸上與剛在台灣上市的CX-30幾乎一樣，長4,395mm、寬1,795mm、高1,570mm、軸距 2,655mm，僅車高增加了30mm，設計上也與CX-30相同採用了新一代Kodo 魂動設計，家族化風格明確。不過在視覺上最為搶眼的，則是其自C柱之後下拉至車尾的斜背式設計、2 Tone雙色車頂，以及與停產的招牌轉子引擎跑車RX-8相 同的半對開式後車門（RX-8車主表示崩潰）。


與停產的招牌轉子引擎跑車RX-8相 同的半對開式後車門。

動力上採用名為e-Skyactiv的純電動力系統，其鋰電池組具有35.5kWh容量，但具體的續航里程則尚未公布。支援已普遍化的 DC 直流快充與家用 6.6kW 交流電充電，而如果使用50Kw高壓充電樁，可於 40 分鐘內充到 80%的電量，數據與現行純電車標準差不多。不過純電車的瞬間加速度與扭力輸出都比內燃機高上許多，所以MAZDA自傲的GVC＋G 力導引系統在MX-30上就升級成e-GVC＋版本，以對應不同的動力輸出。MX-30預計2020年開始在日本交車，之後可能會再推出搭載轉子增程引擎的版本。


視覺上最為搶眼的，則是其自C柱之後下拉至車尾的斜背式設計。

銳氣滿滿
SUBARU Levorg大改款Protype


第二代Levorg應用了SUBARU最新的 Dynamic x Solid 設計語彙。

第二代Levorg應用了SUBARU最新的 Dynamic x Solid 設計語彙，更為銳利的車頭線條與頭尾燈設計，加上微微外擴的肌肉感線條，讓原本就有最帥Station Wagon稱號的Levorg更為動感。動力上原廠僅透露採用了全新設計的 1.8 升渦輪增壓水平對臥引擎，動力、排廢與能源效率都有所提昇。科技方面則導入了最新一代的EyeSight 主動安全系統，車身搭載了四具攝影機與雷達可完整偵測周邊狀態，並接收天頂衛星系統的信號搭配高精度圖資，預先偵測前方路況與交通狀態。Levorg大改款預計2020年下半年於日本推出。

[On-site direct hit] TMS 2019 Tokyo Auto Show I--production car and prototype car
01 Nov 2019, 12:24 by 鞠豪杰 Jet Chu, You Mingyuan
The 46th Tokyo Motor Show (Tokyo Motor Show 2019, TMS 2019, 10/25~11/04, like other large international auto shows, faces the dilemma of exhibitors constantly pulling their legs, but at the organizer JAMA Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association Efforts and the strength of the local team's Japanese car factory, the Tokyo Motor Show is the largest in history! In this auto show, the world also launched a variety of new mass production and prototype models, the power system covers pure oil, oil and electricity With pure electricity, there are many more likely to introduce Taiwan sales, are you interested? Please see our on-site direct report!
Someone asked me that the information is now transmitted at the speed of light. At the same time that the new car information is unveiled, the Internet will be simultaneously publicized. Why do you have to go to Japan with great expense? I said, what you see is just a bunch of information and cold images, but when I was at the Tokyo Motor Show in 2019, I felt not only the cultural heritage of the big car country, but also the roots of everyone, for the vehicle. Love and enthusiasm!


A look at the Tokyo Motor Show - NISSAN.

TOYOTA Yaris big change


The new big change Yaris accident did not appear in the TOYOTA pavilion, but the department store next door was lucky to see its deity.

Perhaps President Toyoda Zhang’s film was accidentally “official” in the test of the new Corolla on the open circuit. TOYOTA had to pre-empt the release of the new look and specifications of the new generation of Yaris before the Tokyo Motor Show. The new generation of Yaris adopts the latest GA-B compact car modular platform in the TNGA family. Its appeal is high rigidity, light weight and low center of gravity. The overall weight is 50 kg less than the previous generation. The new generation of Yaris is 3,940mm (-5mm) x 1,695mm (+50mm) x 1,500mm (-40mm) compared to the current model, but the wheelbase is increased by 50mm to 2,560mm. It is better ride comfort and dynamic performance.


3D stereo structure of the rear light group.

The new design with the concept of ""B-Dash!"" makes the new generation of Yaris more fierce, sharp headlights and the head and roof of Two Tone, the overall sense of movement and vitality is greatly increased, plus 3D stereo structure The rear light group has long been a commuter.


Sharp headlights and Two Tone's front and roof, the overall sense of movement and vitality increased.

The new generation of Yaris is also fully updated! A total of 1.5 liters of inline three-cylinder Dynamic natural intake engine, 1.0-liter inline three-cylinder natural intake engine, and a new generation of 1.5-liter oil-electric system. The 1.5-litre three-cylinder Dynamic natural intake engine uses Toyota's latest technology, with in-cylinder direct injection, high-speed combustion technology, long stroke and larger valve angle. It features high horsepower and low fuel consumption. Matching is also a new technology. The Direct Shift-CVT gearbox is sure to be a new experience across generations! The new generation of Yaris's Japanese version is expected to be available in Japan in February 2020, and the timetable for Taiwan's introduction is undecided.

The TOYOTA pavilion is full of simple futuristic.

RAV4
DAIHATSU new small SUV


DAIHATSU new small SUV appearance at first glance looks like the TOYOTA five-generation RAV4!

Since its inception, TOYOTA's DAIHATSU has been a car expert. In addition to its high market share in the K-Car market in Japan, the classic Terios ""Little Hummer"" is the first choice for many 4WD players. The new DAIHATSU new small SUV uses the ""DNGA"" platform derived from the TNGA platform. At the moment, it looks like the five-generation RAV4 of TOYOTA. However, from its towering ground height and the use of a large number of scratch-resistant materials, it can be seen that it inherits the excellent off-road capability of Terios. The body measures 3,995mm in length, 1,695mm in width, 1,620mm in height and 2,525mm in wheelbase. The amazing thing is that the car weighs only 980kg, so it should be very light.


The rear design is quite satisfactory.



The interior design is also very similar to the five generations of RAV4.

The power section uses the same group of 1.0-liter three-cylinder turbocharged engine with a CVT gearbox that delivers 98 horsepower and 14.3 kgm of torque. It is said that although DAIHATSU has almost no left-hand drive models, the big brother TOYOTA has launched a dual-car Raize with this car as the blueprint. It is scheduled to be officially released in Japan on November 5, and the chances of leaving the overseas version will increase greatly! In view of the hot sales of NISSAN Kicks and HONDA HR-V in Taiwan, the probability of the introduction of Hetai Automobile should not be too low, but it will be imported or domestically.

The DAIHATSU pavilion is full of Out Door style.

Omni-directional strategy
HONDA Fit big change


The fourth generation of Fit still does not deviate from the introverted style of its warm and kind, and even the shadow of Honda e.

As the main car of HONDA's best-selling global car, the trend of the fourth-generation Fit has been attracting attention from Honda in the world before the show, so when the Tokyo Auto Show was officially released, the scene was almost smashed by the global media! The new four-generation Fit has not lived up to everyone's expectations. A total of five models have been released. The Basic is equipped with a 15-inch bead, and then all Home, Ness, Crosstar and Luxe Trim with 16-inch bezels. The power unit has everything from traditional fuel engines to oil and electric power. Although the detailed power configuration has not yet been announced, it is expected to be the current 1.5-liter Earth Dream in-cylinder direct-injection gasoline engine and the latest generation of oil-electric hybrid power system called ""e:HEV"".


The taillights are designed in a three-dimensional design and the car is a cross-version version of the Crosstar.



The new four-generation Fit has published up to five models, starting with the standard 15-inch bead Basic, then all the 16-lap beaded Home, Ness, Crosstar and Luxe Trim, power unit from the traditional fuel engine To the oil and electricity power.

The appearance of the fourth-generation Fit still does not deviate from its introverted style of gentleness and respect, the mellow and square lines interact with each other, the front and headlights even have a few Honda e shadows, in line with its new generation family Look. Personally feel that the overall sense of the new generation of Fit looks more neutral, and also meets the popular needs of its universal hatchback. However, my Honda iron powder friend is a wailing, it seems that I can not accept the fourth-generation Fit appearance with a little ""meng"" feeling.


The shooting car is equipped with the latest generation of hybrid electric power system called ""e:HEV"".

A more technological and user-friendly driving interface is also the focus of the fourth generation of Fit. The LCD instrument panel and the large central control LCD touch screen make it almost impossible to find traditional instruments on the car. All the settings outside the air conditioner are operated via the buttons on both sides of the steering wheel and the central control LCD screen, so the entire driving interface is more compact, but the whole driving interface is simpler. The traditional gearshift lever has been retained, and the handcart car has been changed to the EPB electronic handcart car (but there are flaws that may affect the time-to-market). The thinner A-pillar and the larger front-side triangular window eliminate most of the steering dead angle, and then the wiper is completely hidden in the lower edge of the front gear, making the driving field wider. In addition to the Honda Sensing Smart Safety Active Protection System, the latest Honda Connect car smart mobile devices will also be fully standard. The fourth-generation Fit is expected to be officially sold in Japan in February 2020, and the timing of Taiwan's introduction is still unclear.


For the first time, the four-generation Fit uses a two-wing steering wheel.



The HONDA pavilion also displays cars and locomotives.

Pure electricity into the soul
MAZDA MX-30


The MX-30 features a new generation of Kodo's soul-driven design with a clear family style.

The rumored MAZDA pure electric car model finally showed up in this Tokyo car! As predicted by many media, this pure electric car is a CUV crossover SUV, and it has been given the name of “MX-30” by MAZDA, although this move makes the owners of MX-5 lament, but It also shows the clear positioning of MAZDA for this pure electric car model. The MX-30 is almost the same size as the CX-30 just listed in Taiwan. It is 4,395mm long, 1,795mm wide, 1,570mm high, and has a wheelbase of 2,655mm. The car height is increased by 30mm and the design is the same as the CX-30. With a new generation of Kodo soul design, the family style is clear. However, the most eye-catching visually is the hatchback design that pulls down from the C-pillar to the rear of the car, the 2 Tone two-color roof, and the same half-open rear door as the discontinued signature rotor engine RX-8 ( The RX-8 owner expressed a crash).


The same half-open rear door as the discontinued signature rotor engine sports car RX-8.

Powered by a pure electric power system called e-Skyactiv, its lithium battery pack has a capacity of 35.5kWh, but the specific cruising range has not been announced. Supports the popular DC DC fast charge and household 6.6kW AC charging, and if you use 50Kw high voltage charging pile, it can charge 80% of electricity in 40 minutes, the data is similar to the current pure electric car standard. However, the instantaneous acceleration and torque output of pure electric vehicles are much higher than those of internal combustion engines, so MAZDA's proud GVC+G force guidance system is upgraded to e-GVC+ version on MX-30 to correspond to different power output. The MX-30 is expected to begin delivery in Japan in 2020, and a version with a rotor range-up engine may be introduced.


The most eye-catching visual is the hatched back design that pulls down from the C-pillar to the rear of the car.



The MAZDA pavilion presents a typical Japanese elegance.

Full of anger
SUBARU Levorg big change Protype


The second generation of Levorg applied SUBARU's latest Dynamic x Solid design vocabulary.

The second generation of Levorg uses SUBARU's latest Dynamic x Solid design vocabulary. The sharper front line and headlight design, combined with the slightly exserted muscle lines, make Levorg, which has the most handsome Station Wagon title, more dynamic. . On the power, the original factory only revealed that the newly designed 1.8-liter turbocharged level-to-horizon engine has improved power, waste and energy efficiency. In science and technology, the latest generation of EyeSight active safety system is introduced. The camera is equipped with four cameras and radars to completely detect the surrounding state, and receive signals from the Zenith satellite system with high-precision maps to detect the road conditions and traffic status in advance. The Levorg big change is expected to be launched in Japan in the second half of 2020.


The sharper taillight design makes the original Levorg more dynamic.



The competition in the SUBARU pavilion is quite strong.
