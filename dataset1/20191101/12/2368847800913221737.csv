採區塊鏈發貨幣 中共想搶第一 恐致金融大亂

01 Nov 2019, 12:47

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】區塊鏈技術可以被運用到很多領域，如果不在法律和道德的框架下運行，就將損害民眾利益。中共央行若發行數字貨幣，存在很多隱憂。
最近「區塊鏈」被習近平提到國家戰略發展層面。10月24日習近平帶領政治局上了一堂區塊鏈專題課，課上發表講話，強調區塊鏈技術的集成應用在新的技術革新和產業變革中起著重要作用。講話發表之後，中、美股市中的區塊鏈概念股集體暴漲，A股市場更有500家宣布了自己和區塊鏈有關。而原本低迷的比特幣一度漲破1萬美元。
中共國務院於2016年12月末的《「十三五」國家資訊化規劃》中將區塊鏈技術列入國家級資訊化規劃內容。2014年央行成立法定數字貨幣專門研究小組。2017年1月，央行成立數字貨幣研究所。2019年8月，中央發文在深圳開展數字貨幣研究和移動支付試點。很多地方一級政府也出臺了區塊鏈政策。
而在一篇報導中共政法委聲稱：在區塊鏈的競賽中，中國的目標就是第一。
國際上作為區塊鏈技術的成熟應用以比特幣為代表的加密幣的發行和交易為主，其顯著特徵為去中心化和匿名性。由民間發行，可以匿名交易。
首先加密幣發行無任何主權政府的背書。美國總統川普(特朗普)曾在推特上表示，比特幣和其它加密貨幣「不是貨幣」，而是作為一種交易資產被納入證券交易委員會(SEC)等各個部門的監管。因此若沒有監管而任由其發行的話，完全可以成為一種「割韮菜」的騙子公司。2018年，美國證券交易委員會緊急叫停一項高達6億美元的ICO（首次代幣發行）籌集到的資金。美國財政部長姆努欽表示，不希望加密貨幣被用於非法活動。
數字貨幣分析師肖磊指出：「美國ICO發展非常緩慢，而且公開的項目很少，有一些是通過私募的形式定向邀請，這是被允許的，但不能向公眾發行，美國在這方面監管非常嚴格。」
濫發人民幣後 中共再一輪加密幣「割韮菜」？!中共央行如果發行數字貨幣，由誰來監控呢？怎樣能保證不濫發呢？而現任中國國際經濟交流中心副理事長黃奇帆在公開講話中提到「中國央行很可能是全球第一個推出數字貨幣DCEP的央行」並提到數字貨幣要能夠與主權的信用相掛鈎，與國家GDP、財政收入、黃金儲備建立適當的比例關係。
人民幣由於超發和濫發，在民間已經失去信用，老百姓被迫買入房產和其它資產來保值。缺乏監控之下，央行一旦進行數字貨幣的發行，不知會給民眾帶來怎樣的後果。
實際上中共發行數字貨幣，就相當於剝奪了民間發行加密幣的權利，而由央行來「割韮菜」。
同時中共對內發行數字貨幣進一步加緊對民眾的金融監控。黃奇帆談到：DCEP將採用雙層運營體系，即人民銀行先把DCEP兌換給銀行或者是其它金融機構，再由這些機構兌換給公眾。當公眾使用時，DCEP可以實現貨幣創造、記帳、流動等數據的即時採集，也就是說在公眾所有的交易資訊都將被記載和掌握。
在國際上加密幣的匿名性使得擁有者在交易時無監管。因此一些研究認為，比特幣的成功背後很有可能是犯罪組織的推動，包括洗錢和購買非法商品以及躲避政府監管向海外轉移鉅資的工具。如恐怖組織「伊斯蘭國」在購買武器時也會使用比特幣，而中共官員的大量的不法資產也可以通過比特幣向海外進行轉移。
擬去「中心化」 逃避美國制裁？而中共對外發行數字貨幣可以和受到美國制裁的俄羅斯、土耳其、以及伊朗等國進行「加密交易」，去除美國這個「中心」，避開國際制裁。若通過現有的國際結算系統，非法交易很容易被發現。如孟晚舟涉嫌利用滙豐銀行帳戶，逃避美國對伊朗的制裁行動，結果被美國發現。因此中共很想繞開SWIFT和CHIPS全球支付體系。並為此引入了人民幣跨境支付系統(CIPS)，其客戶包括被美國的制裁對象如俄羅斯、土耳其。中共昆侖銀行和伊朗之間甚至為了避免制裁進行記帳式「易貨貿易」。
CHIPS系統即紐約清算所銀行間支付系統，世界90%以上的外匯交易都是通過CHIPS完成。SWIFT為世界200多個國家和地區的9,700多家銀行、證券機構、企業與客戶提供交易服務，世界各國幾乎每個金融機構都通過它進行金融交易。結算額中四成使用美元結算。截至2019年3月，人民幣在SWIFT的資金結算額中所占比例僅為1.89%。
習近平在講話提出要加強區塊鏈標準化研究，提升國際話語權和規則制定權。黃奇帆也提到通過區塊鏈試水跨境支付，用實際行動繞開SWIFT和CHIPS全球支付體系。
中共一直在努力促進人民幣的國際化。但是人民幣國際化需要強大的市場經濟基礎和法制為後盾。
所以很可能試圖通過發行數字貨幣，換個「馬夾」來實現人民幣的國際化。如與參與「一帶一路」的國家、受到美國制裁的國家之間進行國際化交易。
無法律、道德規範 恐致金融秩序大亂技術需要在法律和道德的框架下運行，如被無良之輩運用，將可能造成災難。
區塊鏈作為一項技術，在美國等國家，均以公司為主體來進行研發和推廣，並在法律、相關制度甚至是道德框架的下運行。比如臉書欲在全球發行其數字貨幣，法國經濟部長布魯諾•勒梅爾（Bruno Le Maire）對此代表西方七國發表聲明：「沒有建立起相應的法律、管理以及避險機制之前，任何全球性的穩定幣系統都不應開始運營。」
而按照中共以往對高新技術的運用推測，中共在區塊鏈技術的研發和推廣中可能會給現有的國內外金融秩序造成混亂。
例如克隆技術，克隆羊多利出生於1996年7月5日，這意味著克隆技術的成功。但是因為克隆人涉及嚴重的倫理、法律和社會問題，所以並沒有被進一步應用到人類身上。而中國深圳生物學者賀建奎於2018年11月26日宣布一對名為露露和娜娜的基因編輯嬰兒在中國健康誕生。通過修改基因，這對新生雙胞胎嬰兒擁有天然抵抗愛滋病能力。賀的這一舉動引發了國內外的軒然大波。
又如人體器官移植技術，最近中共被國際媒體廣泛報導活體摘取法輪功、新疆維吾爾族等人體器官，甚至形成產業鏈。
還有監控和刷臉技術，考慮到人的隱私權，在國際上並沒有得到廣泛的運用。而在中國，因為新疆維吾爾集中營事件而受到美國制裁的海康威視，之前是一個默默無聞的小公司，因中共監視民眾需求而搖身一變成為全球最大監視器製造商。

The blockchain chain sends money. The CCP wants to grab the first.

01 Nov 2019, 12:47

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 01, 2019] Blockchain technology can be applied to many fields. If it is not operated under the legal and ethical framework, it will harm the interests of the people. If the central bank of the Communist Party issues digital currency, there are many hidden concerns.
Recently, the “blockchain” was mentioned by Xi Jinping as a national strategic development level. On October 24, Xi Jinping led the Politburo to a blockchain topic class, and delivered a speech in class, emphasizing that the integration and application of blockchain technology plays an important role in new technological innovation and industrial transformation. After the speech was published, the blockchain concept stocks in the Chinese and American stock markets soared collectively, and 500 of the A-share market announced that they were related to the blockchain. The originally depressed Bitcoin once broke through $10,000.
The State Council of the Communist Party of China included blockchain technology in the national informationization planning content in the ""13th Five-Year National Informationization Plan"" at the end of December 2016. In 2014, the central bank established a special research group on legal digital currency. In January 2017, the central bank established the Digital Currency Institute. In August 2019, the central government issued a digital currency research and mobile payment pilot in Shenzhen. Many local governments have also introduced blockchain policies.
In a report, the Political and Legal Committee claimed that China’s goal is the first in the blockchain competition.
As a mature application of blockchain technology in the world, the distribution and trading of cryptocurrency represented by Bitcoin is the main feature, which is characterized by decentralization and anonymity. Issued by the private sector, it can be traded anonymously.
First, the cryptocurrency is issued without any endorsement by the sovereign government. US President Trump (Trump) once said on Twitter that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are ""not money,"" but are regulated as a trading asset in various departments such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Therefore, if you do not have supervision and let it be issued, you can become a liar company that cuts the leek. In 2018, the US Securities and Exchange Commission urgently suspended funds raised by a $600 million ICO (first-time token issue). US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that he does not want cryptocurrencies to be used for illegal activities.
Xiao Lei, a digital currency analyst, pointed out: ""The development of ICO in the United States is very slow, and there are few public projects. Some of them are invited through private placement. This is allowed, but it cannot be issued to the public. The United States is very regulated in this regard. strict.""
After the indiscriminate issue of the renminbi, the CCP has another round of cryptocurrency ""cutting leeks""? If the Central Bank of China issues digital currency, who will monitor it? How can we guarantee that it will not be spammed? Huang Qifan, the current vice chairman of the China International Economic Exchange Center, mentioned in his public speech that ""the Chinese central bank is probably the first central bank to introduce the digital currency DCEP in the world"" and mentioned that the digital currency should be linked to the sovereign credit. GDP, fiscal revenue, and gold reserves establish an appropriate proportional relationship.
Due to over-issuance and spamming, the renminbi has lost credit in the private sector, and the people are forced to buy real estate and other assets to preserve their value. Under the lack of supervision, once the central bank issues digital currency, it will not know what consequences it will bring to the people.
In fact, the CCP’s issuance of digital currency is equivalent to depriving the private sector of the right to issue cryptocurrencies, and the central bank will “cut the leeks”.
At the same time, the CCP’s inward issuance of digital currency has further tightened financial monitoring of the public. Huang Qifan said: DCEP will adopt a two-tier operating system, that is, the People's Bank will first convert DCEP to banks or other financial institutions, and then convert them to the public. When used by the public, DCEP can realize the real-time collection of data such as currency creation, billing, and flow, that is, all the transaction information in the public will be recorded and mastered.
The anonymity of cryptocurrency internationally makes the owner unregulated at the time of the transaction. Therefore, some studies believe that the success of Bitcoin is likely to be driven by criminal organizations, including money laundering and the purchase of illegal goods, and the evasion of government regulation to transfer huge amounts of money overseas. For example, the terrorist organization ""Islamic State"" also uses Bitcoin when purchasing weapons, and a large number of illegal assets of CCP officials can also be transferred overseas through Bitcoin.
Is it going to ""centralize"" to evade US sanctions? The CCP’s issuance of digital currency can be “encrypted transactions” with countries such as Russia, Turkey, and Iran that have been sanctioned by the United States, removing the “center” of the United States and avoiding international sanctions. Illegal transactions are easily detected if they pass the existing international settlement system. For example, Meng Zhouzhou was suspected of using the HSBC bank account to evade US sanctions against Iran. The result was discovered by the United States. Therefore, the CCP is keen to circumvent the SWIFT and CHIPS global payment systems. The introduction of the RMB cross-border payment system (CIPS) for this purpose, its clients include sanctions by the United States such as Russia, Turkey. The book-based ""barter trade"" between the Kunlun Bank of the Communist Party of China and Iran even to avoid sanctions.
The CHIPS system is the interbank payment system of the New York Clearing House. More than 90% of the world's foreign exchange transactions are completed through CHIPS. SWIFT provides trading services to more than 9,700 banks, securities institutions, companies and clients in more than 200 countries and regions around the world. Nearly every financial institution in the world conducts financial transactions. 40% of the settlement amount is settled in US dollars. As of March 2019, the proportion of RMB in SWIFT's fund settlement was only 1.89%.
In his speech, Xi Jinping proposed to strengthen the research on blockchain standardization and enhance the right to speak and rule. Huang Qifan also mentioned cross-border payment through the blockchain test, bypassing SWIFT and CHIPS global payment system with practical actions.
The CCP has been working hard to promote the internationalization of the renminbi. But the internationalization of the renminbi requires a strong market economy base and the legal system as the backing.
So it is very likely that we will try to realize the internationalization of the renminbi by issuing digital currency and changing the ""vest"". Such as international transactions with countries participating in the “Belt and Road” and countries subject to US sanctions.
No law, no morality. It is feared that the financial order chaos technology needs to operate under the framework of law and morality. If it is used by unscrupulous people, it will cause disaster.
As a technology, blockchain is developed and promoted in the United States and other countries, and operates under laws, related systems, and even ethical frameworks. For example, Facebook wants to issue its digital currency globally. French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire issued a statement on behalf of the seven western countries: ""After no legal, management and hedging mechanisms have been established, any global Sexual stable currency systems should not be operational.""
According to the CCP's previous use of high technology, the CCP may cause confusion in the existing domestic and international financial order in the development and promotion of blockchain technology.
For example, the cloning technique, cloned sheep Dolly was born on July 5, 1996, which means the success of cloning technology. But because clones involve serious ethical, legal, and social problems, they have not been further applied to humans. On November 26, 2018, the Chinese biologist He Jiankui announced that a pair of genetically edited babies named Lulu and Nana were born in China. By modifying the genes, this has a natural resistance to AIDS for newborn twin babies. He’s move triggered an uproar at home and abroad.
Another example is human organ transplantation technology. Recently, the Chinese Communist Party has been widely reported by the international media to extract human organs such as Falun Gong and Xinjiang Uygur, and even form an industrial chain.
There are also monitoring and brushing techniques that take into account the privacy of people and are not widely used internationally. In China, Hikvision, which was sanctioned by the United States because of the Xinjiang Uyghur concentration camp incident, was previously a small, unknown company. The CCP has become the world's largest monitor manufacturer because it monitors the needs of the people.
