01 Nov 2019, 12:32

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】NBA休斯頓火箭隊的威斯布魯克（Russell Westbrook）和哈登（James Harden）10月31日再度成功連線，威斯布魯克17分、12助攻、10籃板，繳出「大三元」成績，哈登單場砍進59分，並且在最後2.4秒罰進關鍵一球，兩大後場帶領球隊以159：158氣走華盛頓奇才，勇奪三連勝。
這場兩隊火力全開，防不勝防，前三節奇才117：111取得6分優勢。到了決勝節，奇才依舊手感火燙，讀秒前4分27秒，布萊恩（Thomas Bryant）「三分打」幫助巫師147：136將差距拉大到雙位數。前面才拿7分的威斯布魯克這時用大號三分，為火箭吹起反攻號角，哈登三分球跟進，火箭開始縮小落後。

比爾（Bradley Beal）罰進2球，終止奇才得分荒，威斯布魯克馬上用拿手個人切入為火箭追加2分，火箭步步逼近，在戈登（Eric Gordon）三分外線下，以153：152反超前，這時比爾一波攻勢再要回領先，不過威斯布魯克也以火力回敬，塔克（PJ Tucker）罰進2球後，在三分線外犯比爾一規，比爾三罰全進，剩下7.7秒，分數來到158：158，比賽重回原點。
這時哈登吸引對手犯規，最後2.4秒站上罰球線，兩罰中一，奇才最後想做攻擊，可惜時間不等人，終場以1分之差惜敗。
