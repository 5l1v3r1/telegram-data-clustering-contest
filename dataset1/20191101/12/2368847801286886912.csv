宣傳新片《再見UFO》徐天佑抨擊港府亂港

01 Nov 2019, 12:15

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】由徐天佑等主演的港產片《再見UFO》，日前被遴選為第16屆「香港亞洲電影節」的開幕影片。受訪時被問及港府因強推「逃犯條例」而引發的香港亂局是否比UFO更難以置信，徐天佑脫口而出：「沒有最荒謬，只有更荒謬！」言語中透露出對港府亂港的不滿和香港未來的擔憂。
港產片《再見UFO》被選為10月29日開鑼的「香港亞洲電影節」（HKAFF）的開幕片，影片由梁栢堅導演，徐天佑、黃又南和蔡卓妍主演。電影講述，1980年代三人在華富村曾目擊UFO低飛經過的都市傳說，令他們一直深信世界上存在UFO和外星人，不過在歲月漸長、生活無奈以及時代變遷中，眾人離夢想愈來愈遠。影片提出了夢想和現實究竟哪一樣更重要這一發人深省的問題。
一直力挺香港「反送中」運動的徐天佑，近日接受「香港01」的專訪。被問及他有沒有覺得香港今年發生的事比UFO更難以置信時，他憤然表示：「沒有最荒謬，只有更荒謬！今次這部戲其實是在說我們的夢想，現在的社會……」
徐天佑在片中飾演的角色，本來是一位很努力向上的打工仔。打幾份工都不嫌辛苦的他，只希望有朝一日銀行戶頭夠錢移民，但在後來經歷香港經濟起飛，他轉型炒股才是惡夢的開始，最後血本無歸，極度頹廢，終日在家借酒消愁。
現實中的徐天佑與片中的角色有巨大反差。徐天佑透露，自己剛出來工作時就很幸運，除了唱歌，還拍了不少廣告，掙的錢比很多同齡人多，順風順水讓他特別知足。
徐天佑以歌唱組合SHINE出道，現在演歌雙棲。幾個月來，他為社會議題頻頻發聲，導致歌唱組合被中共列入黑名單。被問及將來是否還會以SHINE的形式在大陸辦演唱會時，他在Facebook回應網民：「不再有SHINE（NO MORE SHINE）。」
至於已有一陣子沒與組合的另一成員黃又南聯絡，徐天佑表示：「聯絡是少了，但沒理由不再是朋友。」雖然經紀人否認兩人拆夥，但10月29日，兩人現身主演的電影《再見UFO》首映禮時是零交流，不少樂迷慨嘆兩人分道揚鑣甚可惜。
6月12日，港警向「反送中」市民發射了150枚催淚瓦斯、20發布袋彈及數發橡膠子彈，徐天佑當天在社交網站譴責警方，並為抗爭的年輕人打氣。
7月21日晚，警黑勾結的白衣人血洗元朗，恐怖事件發生後，徐天佑在facebook以黑底白字控訴：「無法無天！人神共憤！」並呼籲「大家振作」。
7月31日，他在facebook宣布，已經向劇組成功申請了8月5日不排戲，以實際行動支持全港大罷工。當有網民贊他是「藝人榜樣」時，他回應「是本分」。
一名年輕男子在元朗看到大批市民遇襲，故對香港的未來感到心灰意冷，甚至萌生輕生念頭，在Facebook留下遺言後下落不明，徐天佑得知後馬上在facebook發文：「後生仔，我撐你，你們是最好的！你知道嗎？我也不是很老的人。」還通過發帖參與尋人，呼籲「一個都不能少」，最後，他在Facebook宣布，成功尋回該名男子。
勇於發聲的徐天佑，因將facebook頭像轉為黑色表達對社會紛爭的心情，結果引來中共小粉紅們留言挑釁。不過，他從沒因此退縮，認為自己有發聲的權利。
被問及是否因為年輕人發聲而招致黑幫威脅，徐天佑表示：「我不怕，因為我知道我做的是正義的事情。年輕人是我們的下一代，香港的未來就靠他們，大家齊上齊落。」
此次接受「香港01」專訪時，徐天佑被問及是否擔心因表達立場影響工作、當初內心有沒有掙扎，他坦然表示，自己第一次觸及「敏感話題」時，其實完全沒有多作考慮。他說，「將自己看到的事講出來，表達內心感受，這是一個人的權利。」
訪問中，徐天佑預告，自己接下來會發表新專輯。至於內容會否關乎香港時事，他點頭回應：「我會看一下。因為自己寫出來的歌詞不知道別人有何感受，但這絕對是一件好事，是一種啟發，有時想法有好多，又不能用三言兩語去講完，所以音樂是不錯的選擇。」
他還表示，「因為現在至少暫時不會以組合SHINE的形式作音樂，因此很自由，也很有動力，預算很清楚。即便因政治立場工作受影響，但我都不會計較。」
