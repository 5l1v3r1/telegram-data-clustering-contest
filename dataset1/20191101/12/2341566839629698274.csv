（中央社華盛頓31日綜合外電報導）美國總統川普今天說，他將把佛羅里達州棕櫚灘列為他的永久住所，而非他位於紐約市的川普大樓（Trump Tower）。
路透社報導，川普是自1985年起擁有位於棕櫚灘（Palm Beach）的海湖俱樂部（Mar-a-Lago），在他擔任總統期間，他待在海湖俱樂部時間比在位於紐約第5大道（Fifth Avenue）的豪華大廈還長。
川普在推特發文說：「我的家人與我將把佛羅里達州棕櫚灘列為我們的永久住所。」
他寫道：「儘管我每年繳了數以百萬計美元的市政、州與地方稅，紐約市與紐約州的政治領導人還是對我非常糟。」



川普從小到大都住在紐約，他是在紐約市皇后區長大，之後搬到曼哈頓。川普大樓是他的住所，也是他的房地產公司川普集團（Trump Organization）的總部。
川普說：「身為總統，我會一直在那裡協助紐約與很棒的紐約人。紐約在我心中總是有個特殊的位置！」
共和黨籍的川普與民主黨籍的紐約市長白思豪（Bill de Blasio）和紐約州長古莫（Andrew Cuomo）不和。
古莫在推特發文說：「終於擺脫他了…他現在是你們的人了，佛羅里達州。」白思豪在推特說：「要走快走，沒人擋你。」






「紐約時報」報導，川普是於9月底在棕櫚灘郡巡迴法院申請變更主要居住地。
川普將在明年11月競選連任，如果勝選，他將把白宮當作住所直到2025年1月。（譯者：張曉雯/核稿：盧映孜）1081101

Trump approved the mayor of New York to be too bad for him. Permanent residence changed to Florida
01 Nov 2019, 12:47 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency, Washington, 31st, comprehensive foreign news report) US President Trump said today that he will list Palm Beach, Florida as his permanent residence, not his Trump Tower in New York City.
Reuters reported that Trump had owned the Sea-Lake Club (Mar-a-Lago) in Palm Beach since 1985. During his presidency, he stayed at the Sea Lake Club for 5 times in New York. The luxury building on Fifth Avenue is still long.
Trump issued a message on Twitter: ""My family and I will list Palm Beach, Florida as our permanent residence.""
He wrote: ""Although I pay millions of dollars in municipal, state and local taxes every year, the political leaders in New York City and New York are still very bad for me.""



Trump lived in New York from small to large. He grew up in Queens, New York City, and moved to Manhattan. Trump Tower is his residence and the headquarters of his real estate company Trump Organization.
Trump said: ""As a president, I will always be there to assist New York with great New Yorkers. New York always has a special place in my heart!""
Republican Trump is not in harmony with the Democratic New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.
Gumo wrote on Twitter: ""I finally got rid of him... He is yours now, Florida."" Bai Sihao said on Twitter: ""If you want to go, no one will stop you.""






The New York Times reported that Trump applied for a change of primary residence at the Palm Beach County Circuit Court at the end of September.
Trump will run for re-election in November next year. If he wins, he will use the White House as a residence until January 2025. (Translator: Zhang Xiaowen / Nuclear Release: Lu Yingwei) 1081101
