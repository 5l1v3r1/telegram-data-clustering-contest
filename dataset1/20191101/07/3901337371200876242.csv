Upon the Frenchman's big-money arrival at the Camp Nou at the beginning of the season, many Spanish publications claimed Messi was not entirely happy he was brought into the squad.
Before the 28-year-old had signed for the Catalan giants, the Argentine caused a stir when he refused to answer questions about the former Atletico Madrid forward in an interview, perhaps due to the way Griezmann had snubbed the club a season earlier.

""Leo and Grizi get along, the same as Leo and (Ousmane) Dembele get along, or Leo with Pedro or (David) Villa.

""Just because he doesn't get along (with Griezmann) like he does with Luis doesn't mean they get along badly.""
