Thembi Kgatlana’s goal against Spain will go down in history as South Africa’s first goal at a WWC, and the team left France with their heads held high after having been pitted in what many had dubbed the group of death.
Now, with SAFA looking to try and take Banyana to the next level, they have decided to design a logo for the team that is separate to that of their male counterparts.
On Banyana’s official Twitter account yesterday they stated, “SAFA today launched the Banyana Banyana logo in Johannesburg… Acting CEO, Russell Paul, said it was important that Banyana also have their own identity just like Bafana.”



Meanwhile, Ellis’ full team for the upcoming encounter Japan is as follows:
Goalkeepers:Andile Dlamini, Kaylin Swart, Jessica Williams.
Defenders:Lebogang Ramalepe, Bambanani Mbane, Nothando Vilakazi, Tiisetso Makhubela, Noko Matlou, Ongeziwe Ndlangisa. 
Midfielders:Leandra Smeda, Mamello Makhabane, Busisiwe Ndimeni, Refiloe Jane, Kholosa Biyana, Linda Motlhalo, Robyn Moodaly, Noxolo Cesane, Nomvula Kgoale.
Forwards:Jermaine Seoposenwe, Rhoda Mulaudzi, Thembi Kgatlana, Lelona Daweti.
