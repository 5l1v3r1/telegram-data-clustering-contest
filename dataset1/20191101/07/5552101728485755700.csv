涉襲胸男客不起訴還囂張留負評　麵店公布影像網友全怒了

一名蔡姓男客，到苗栗後龍一家人氣麵店用餐，涉嫌對女員工襲胸，老闆挺員工提告，但檢察官認為有摸奶，但可能不是故意，對蔡男作出不起訴處分，而蔡男得了便宜還賣乖，到該店家臉書留負評，嗆說：「請你們越南員工不要一直告人，來你們家吃麵還一直被告」，老闆痛斥蔡男「吃人夠夠」！憤而公布摸奶影片，請網友評評理。
襲胸事件發生在6月19日上午，越南籍的楊姓女員工說，當時她正要走進煮麵區時，蔡姓男子將點菜單遞給她時，「故意、順勢」觸摸到了她的右胸，整個過程短短不到1秒，她嚇呆了，不知怎麼反應，事後才告訴老闆。
黃姓老闆說，楊女係來自越南的新住民，到他麵店工作5年多，相當賣力，當他知道自己的員工遭受性騷擾，力挺她討回公道，並陪著報案，警方根據監視器，「以車追人」找到蔡男，依涉嫌性騷擾防治法函送苗栗地檢署偵辦。
檢方認為，雖有摸到胸部，但不能確定是故意的，犯罪事實不足，裁定不起訴；而楊女上訴，被台中高分院駁回，但告訴人若認為有疑義，可向法院聲請交付審判。

打贏了官司，蔡姓男客很故意的到該麵店臉書留言：「本人與內人今年6月19日到該店吃麵，在遞菜單給越南籍女服務員時，不慎觸碰該員身體，於10天後被該員提起性騷擾告訴，經苗栗地檢署判決（編按：應為認定）非故意之行為，處分不起訴，但該員一再提告遭駁回，其行徑不知為何？請諸位紳士大德到此用餐要注意自己動作，以免吃上官司，阿彌陀佛！」
黃姓老闆氣不過，昨在臉書不公開社團《爆料公社二社》發文，將蔡男疑似襲胸的影片po上網，讓網友評評理，他質疑：「是故意還是不小心？已提告檢察官不起訴，得了便宜還賣乖，讓人生氣！」
影片公布後，不少客人在店家臉書留言說「加油！告倒那個色鬼！太噁心了！」「嚴懲色狼！支持店家！」「提再議，如再不起訴就請律師交付審判！一定要讓那性騷擾的狗雜碎被判刑！」也有網友說：「那個手太故意」「擺明要吃豆腐，裝什麼無辜」「不小心摸到都會說聲抱歉吧，摸了就走裝沒事分明故意」「正常人給完菜單，手會留在那嗎？」

A male surnamed Cai, who went to the Miaoli Houlong family's popular noodle shop, was suspected of attacking the female employee's chest. The boss told the staff to report it, but the prosecutor thought that there was milking, but it may not be intentional. And Cai Man got the bargain and sold it, and went to the store's Facebook to leave a comment.

Huang’s boss said that Yang’s newcomer from Vietnam had worked in his noodle shop for more than five years and was quite hard.

In the case of ""chasing people by car"", I found Cai Nan, and sent it to the Miaoli Land Inspection Office for investigation on the law of sexual harassment.
The prosecution believes that although it touched the chest, it was not certain that it was intentional. The criminal facts were insufficient and the ruling was not prosecuted.

According to the judgment of the Miaoli District Procuratorate (Editor's note: it should be confirmed), the unintentional act did not sue, but the member repeatedly refused to sue, and his behavior was unknown. Why? Please go to the gentleman Dade to pay attention to his actions, so as not to eat the lawsuit, Amitabha!""

""Reassure, if you don't sue, ask the lawyer to deliver the trial! Be sure to Let the sexually harassed dog chopped up and sentenced!"" Some netizens said, ""That hand is too deliberate."" ""When you want to eat tofu, what is innocent?"" ""If you accidentally touch it, you will say sorry, if you touch it, you will be clear and deliberate."" ""A normal person gives the menu, will the hand stay there?""
