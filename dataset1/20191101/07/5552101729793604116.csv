【星宇K董點子王】張國煒忙不停　回國兩天親自驗收貨運辦公室
01 Nov 2019, 07:03 by 徐珍翔
隨著星宇航空開航日子逼近，星宇人從上到下可說是忙不停，繼8月機場地勤進駐桃機、日前董事長張國煒親赴德國接機後，在永儲公司內的貨運作業辦公室也緊接著成立，預計明（2020）年1月開航後，就要正式對外營運。
像個閒不下來的大小孩，張國煒回國不到短短兩天，10月30日又率領星宇航空總經理翟建華等人前往永儲公司，親自驗收剛完工的CARGO貨運作業辦公室，並與第一線的同仁開心合影。
「貨運作業辦公室堪稱國際貨物的票務櫃台，負責處理進出口文件簽辦、進儲貨物、整備裝機，……K董今早一視同仁，同樣以新機驗收的高標準，逐一檢視作業安全、硬體設備和員工需求，未來貨運集散中心就在『永儲』提供完善航空運輸服務。」星宇航空日前在臉書粉絲團放上一系列照片，再度引起話題。

星宇航空宣布，隨著貨運作業辦公室就定位，相關服務也即將上線，「星宇航空貨運業務預計於明年1月開航後正式對外營運，承載貨運完成短距離航線的運送任務，珍惜所託、誠如親送。」
近年電子商務蓬勃發展，全球貨運運能大增，成長率已逐漸凌駕客運，因此也成為兵家必爭之地；目前長榮航空的貨運業務占營收比重僅20％不到，仍低於中華航空的25％以上水準，因此正打算進一步擴大，如今遇上星宇航空挾帶著高人氣加入戰局，恐怕面臨變數。
據悉，星宇航空預計今年底再引進兩架A321neo客機，到明年開航時，一共有3架新機上線服務，即便是明年的交機數量，也不過3、4架左右，以每架腹艙空間可裝載4噸貨物來看（含旅客行李），短期內運能有限；不過，到了2021年，一年報到的新機將高達12架左右，往後機隊更是逐年擴增，屆時可望出現爆炸性成長。

[Xingyu K Dongzizi Wang] Zhang Guofan is busy, returning to China for two days to personally check the cargo office
01 Nov 2019, 07:03 by Xu Zhenxiang
With the approaching days of Xingyu Airlines approaching, Xingyu people can be said to be busy from top to bottom. Following the arrival of the airport grounds in August in August, the former chairman Zhang Guofan went to Germany to pick up the plane, in the Yongshang company. The freight operation office was also established immediately. It is expected that after the start of the flight in January 2020, it will be officially operated.
Like a big child who can't afford to go, Zhang Guofan returned to China for less than two days. On October 30, he led the general manager of Xingyu Airlines, Jianhua Jian, and others to the Yongkang Company to personally accept the newly completed CARGO Freight Operations Office. The first line of colleagues happy photo.
""The freight operation office is called the ticket counter for international goods. It is responsible for handling the import and export documents, loading and unloading goods, and preparing for the loading and unloading. ...K Dong will treat everyone this morning, and also check the safety of the work one by one with the high standards of new machine acceptance. The equipment and staff demand, the future cargo distribution center will provide perfect air transportation services in the ""Yongshang""."" Xingyu Airlines recently put a series of photos on the Facebook fan group, and once again caused a topic.

Xingyu Airlines announced that with the positioning of the freight operation office, the related services will be launched soon. ""Xingyu air cargo business is expected to be officially operated after sailing in January next year, carrying cargo to complete the short-distance route transportation tasks, cherish the trust, Sincerely, I will send it.""
In recent years, e-commerce has flourished, global freight transportation capacity has increased greatly, and the growth rate has gradually surpassed passenger transportation. Therefore, it has become a battleground for military strategists; at present, EVA Air’s cargo business accounts for less than 20% of revenue, still lower than China Airlines. More than 25% of the level, so is planning to further expand, and now encounters Xingyu Airlines, with high popularity to join the battle, I am afraid to face variables.
It is reported that Xingyu Airlines expects to introduce two A321neo passenger aircrafts by the end of this year. When sailing next year, there will be three new machines on-line service. Even if the number of flights next year is about 3 or 4, each belly compartment will be used. The space can be loaded with 4 tons of cargo (including passenger luggage), and the transportation capacity is limited in a short period of time; however, by 2021, the number of new machines reported in one year will be as high as 12, and the fleet will be expanded year by year. Hope for explosive growth.
