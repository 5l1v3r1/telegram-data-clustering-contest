According to Chief of Conner Police Capt. Manuel Canipas Jr., the truck's engine suddenly stopped while the vehicle was climbing up an uphill road in Barangay Karikitan. With the engine dead, the truck swiftly went backward and slid down into a 20-metre deep ravine. He added that, according to an initial investigation, the truck carried too many passengers which along with its weight caused the tragic accident.

The reports added that the majority of those killed were elderly people. They were on their way to the village of Lattut from the Kalinga province where they received financial support and seeds from the government.
Eleven of the injured people have been taken to Conner District Hospital and 11 others are being treated at Cagayan Valley Medical Center.
An investigation into the accident is underway.
The last similar incident took place in December 2017 when a bus crashed into another car, which claimed the lives of 20 of the 29 passengers.
