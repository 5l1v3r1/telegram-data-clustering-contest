為何越南人、中國人和大馬華人都到英國打黑工：僑匯是改變家鄉命運的希望
01 Nov 2019, 07:06 by 杜晉軒


我們想讓你知道的是為何越南人不到發達省份工作，也要冒險偷渡到海外工作呢？因為高回酬的僑民是改變家鄉命運的希望，加上越南護照在國際不通用，只能鋌而走險。



「突然BBC的新聞出來，發現58具屍體，懷疑都是中國人，那時候很震撼，我還記得我在學校圖書館，那一幕我記得很清楚，我整個背脊都涼了⋯⋯」
2000年的英國多佛港慘案，給當時在英國留學的唐南發留下難以磨滅的記憶。
唐南發是馬來西亞人，目前是國際勞工組織駐馬來西亞辦事處國家項目協調員，曾在聯合國難民署的曼谷、吉隆坡、雅加達辦公室任職，長期關注國際難民、移工議題。
也許是時代的巧合，唐南發在英國留學期間，打工生活中認識了不少來自中國的非法移民。唐南發記得，由於多佛港慘案的死者多來自中國福州，因此身邊的中國朋友都很震撼，尤其倫敦的福州社群感受更深，因為有的死者就是家鄉的親友。
至今，還是有不少的中國、越南人為申請難民身份而偷渡到英國，無論最終能否「成為難民」，在英國政府的審核、打官司過程期間，都能讓他們留在當地打工，賺取高於原居地的英鎊收入，以「僑匯」的方向回鄉改變家族的命運，這也是為何仍有許多中國、越南的貧困家庭，願意四處借貸讓家中成員遠赴海外打工，即使知道這是相當高風險的賭注。（編按：僑匯為旅居海外的該國居民或僑民匯入故鄉國的款項。）
除了來自中國、越南的亞洲非法移民，其實在英國也有不少馬來西亞的非法移民，只是他們的移動途徑更「安全」。

馬來西亞的「跳飛機」潮

馬來西亞曾是全球重要的錫礦出口國，然而錫價在八〇年代末崩盤後，造成了大批原從事錫礦業的華人城鎮陷入經濟發展困境，尤其當中教育程度較低的華人受到的失業衝擊最大，為改變生活，他們只好「跳飛機」。
所謂「跳飛機」，是指這些欲前往已開發國家，如英國、澳洲、日本打黑工的華人，多購買飛機票進入當地後，就在當地逾期逗留非法工作的俗稱。雖然這些年大馬的經濟也有成長，但仍有少部分人在澳洲跳飛機，甚至尋求難民庇護。根據澳洲政府2018年的統計，該年度尋求庇護者申請簽證覆核的三大來源國分別是：馬來西亞（5858人）、中國（1561人）、越南（465人）。
唐南發表示，大馬並非很窮的國家，經濟發展勉強，不過大馬公民比越南人幸運的是，大馬的護照在許多國家是免簽的，加上又是英聯邦國家，因此大馬公民可以此入境澳洲後，再申請難民，而他當年在英國所見到「跳飛機」而來的大馬人也是如此。
曾經馬來半島的霹靂州、森美蘭州是錫礦的重要產地，因此錫礦業垮後，到英國跳飛機的華人也多來自這兩州，尤其是霹靂州。唐南發解釋，多數大馬華人到歐洲跳飛機的終點站之所以只有英國，乃因在英國的華人社群主要是廣東人和福州人，而霹靂州的華人祖籍又多為廣府人，也有些福州人，因此在倫敦打工有語言相通的便利性，許多倫敦的香港餐廳老闆也樂於聘僱懂粵語的霹靂州華人；至於在歐陸國家，如意大利的華人社群，則多是江浙人，祖籍來源地多為中國南方省份的大馬華人因不通江浙方言，因此多不選擇到歐陸國家跳飛機。（編按：廣府人係以粵語為母語、來自中國嶺南地區的族群。）
唐南發自我調侃說，雖然他常在馬國國內政治課題上批評首相馬哈迪，但他還是肯定馬哈迪在90年代初，很努力地向歐洲各國爭取免簽證待遇，再加上大馬屬於英聯邦國家，因此大馬護照含金量相當高。唐南發記得，他曾在捷克的福州人市場被問是否能出售個人護照，對方開價高達幾萬元馬幣，而他當然拒絕了。
唐南發進一步指出，相比越南人、中國人是透過人蛇集團集體偷渡的情況，欲跳飛機的大馬華人多在旅行社安排下，先以團體落地歐洲大陸旅遊幾天，再進入英國「觀光」，最終以「走丟」的形式離開。唐南發表示，有的旅行社甚至會居中協助跳飛機者聯繫在英國的接頭人（多為大馬人），以順利在當地找工作。
2019年的亨氏護照指數排行榜（Henley Passport Index）顯示，大馬護照在全球免簽通行榜中排第13，中國排名第74，越南排名第95。與越南同一排名的還有寮國、埃及、約旦、安哥拉和海地，至今越南護照在國際通用程度相當低。

海外越南裔社群對原鄉越南人的吸引力

近年來在台灣所看到的越南新聞，除台商工廠在當地製造環境污染、發生罷工的負面新聞外，還有越南經濟起飛、中美貿易戰帶來的轉單效應讓越南得利等正面新聞，因此越南在看似發展前景佳的趨勢下，為何還會發生英國艾塞克斯郡（Essex）冷凍貨櫃39死慘案？
「你說他（越南人）窮，但也不是真的窮到沒飯吃，如果他還能借到兩三萬（英）磅，來冒這個險，就表示這個省工作機會變少了，」唐南發說。
英國電視台CHANNEL 4報導，疑似親人就是在冷凍貨櫃39死慘案中身亡的越南家庭，多來自中部的沿海省份，當地漁民因海洋污染，漁獲減少，生計受影響下，許多人只好鋌而走險到英國打黑工。CHANNEL 4的新聞片段中也提到2016年時，越南群眾爆發抗議台灣企業污染海洋﹐扼殺他們生計的事件。2016年4月，台塑越南河靜鋼鐵廠因排放廢水造成越南海岸汙染，事後台塑支付越南政府5億美元補償金，不過今年6月有近百位越南人跨海來台，替7875位原告控告台塑鋼鐵廠24位股東及董事應賠償新台幣1.4億餘元。《自由時報》報導，7875位原告大多為越南中部河靜、廣平、廣治、義安等4個省的漁船船主、產鹽業者、漁業相關工作者、潛水夫等。
因此對於為何不到本國其它經濟發達的城市或工業區工作，唐南發認為，有的人會想即使在經濟發達胡志明市打工，但得工作多少年才能在家鄉蓋一棟房子？而有的在海外打工的同鄉，在給家鄉的僑匯幫助下蓋了房子，進而形塑了原鄉當地人對海外打工的美好想像，認為在海外打工是值得的，而社交媒體的發達更鞏固了這印象。因此有的越南人寧願到海外偷渡，也不願意到其他省工作。


《不漏洞拉：越南船民的故事》作者黃雋慧Photo Credit：杜晉軒

黃雋慧是位針對發生在上世紀七〇年代越南難民潮的民間研究者，著有《不漏洞拉：越南船民的故事》一書。黃雋慧跟《關鍵評論網》表示，南北越統一後爆發的難民潮，使得越南人在海外散枝開葉，在歐洲、美國、加拿大等地區形成許多越南裔社群。她指出，儘管越南經濟有在發展，不過農村仍並未真正受惠，出國打工賺取外匯的現象依舊普遍；雖然歐洲比台灣﹑香港﹑日本等越南公民可合法打工的亞洲地區遠，但由於英國﹑德國﹑法國，甚至一些前華沙公約國，都各有相當完整的離散越南社群，故無論合法與否，到當地後總會找到人投靠，有機會被安排到美甲店打工，或到非法的大麻種植場工作。
黃雋慧記得，二十多年前加拿大仍未合法化大麻種植﹐加國政府曾大力打擊大麻種植場。由於種植者多在租房內種植﹐因此俗稱「大麻屋」﹐這些租戶的用電量異乎尋常的大﹐因此成了加國政府追查的線索﹐而當年就有不少越南裔在種植大麻。
對於上述僑匯造福家鄉的情況，唐南發稱這和以前跳飛機的大馬人是一樣的。無論在倫敦、東京如何辛苦打工，他們都不會告訴家人在海外打工的辛酸，多是報喜不報憂，如稱在英國可每週賺到三、四百英鎊，但實情可能並非如此，被家鄉的人聽了，自然心生嚮往，而人蛇集團自然也看準了這心態。
唐南發強調，越南人即使成功借錢偷渡到海外，但在負債累累的情況下，往往被迫成了「現代奴隸」，被迫在海外從事低薪危險的工作，女性也有被迫賣淫的風險，而且他們無法逃跑，因為人蛇集團知道他們來自哪個鄉，可能會給家人帶來危險。唐南發以英國非政府組織Anti-Slaver的報告數據為例，從2009年至2018年間，有多達3,187名越南公民被確認為人口販運的可能受害者，且當中包括數百名孩童 。
另一方面，由於越南人欲申請往海外工作需要透過層層關係處理，因此有的地方的共產黨領導也身兼仲介。唐南發以他處理過的個案為例，有個越南人因為家鄉地方領導與仲介勾結，雖然成功把他帶到大馬工作，但卻被仲介詐騙、欠薪，最終他逃走後輾轉回到越南找那領導算賬，結果那領導反找警察來打他。
最後，唐南發提醒，英國的政局變化也是影響亞洲非法移民湧入與否的因素。在英國決定脫歐的這幾年來，由於原在英國從事低層勞動工作的東歐移工眼看形勢不對，紛紛離開英國，因此形成了龐大的人力缺口，更需要亞洲的勞動力填補。唐南發認為，英國不僅是全歐洲最依賴外來勞動移民的國家，同時也是最排擠他們的國家。

Why do Vietnamese, Chinese and Malaysian Chinese go to the UK to work as a black worker: remittances are a hope to change the destiny of their hometown
01 Nov 2019, 07:06 by Du Jinxuan


What we want you to know is why Vietnamese people do not work in developed provinces, but also risk smuggling to work overseas. Because the high-return diaspora is the hope of changing the fate of his hometown, and the Vietnamese passport is not universal in the international arena, he can only take risks.



""Suddenly, the news of the BBC came out and found 58 bodies. I suspected that they were all Chinese. It was very shocking at that time. I still remember that I was in the school library. I remember very clearly in that scene. My entire back was cold.""
In 2000, the tragedy in Dover, England, left an indelible memory for Donnan, who was studying in the UK.
Tang Nanfa is a Malaysian. He is currently the National Project Coordinator of the ILO's Malaysia Office. He has served in the UNHCR's offices in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta, and has long been concerned about international refugees and migrant workers.
Perhaps it is the coincidence of the times. During his studies in the UK, Tang Nanfa met many illegal immigrants from China during his working life. Tang Nanfa remembers that since the deceased in the Dover port tragedy came from Fuzhou, China, the Chinese friends around him were very shocked. Especially the Fuzhou community in London felt deeper, because some of the deceased were relatives and friends in their hometown.
So far, there are still many Chinese and Vietnamese who have sneaked into the UK to apply for refugee status. Whether they can eventually become refugees, they can stay in the local government during the review and lawsuit process of the British government. Higher than the sterling income of the original place of residence, returning to the hometown in the direction of ""remittances"" to change the family's destiny, which is why there are still many poor families in China and Vietnam who are willing to borrow money to let their family members go overseas to work, even if they know that this is A fairly high risk bet. (Editor's note: Remittances are remitted to the home country by residents or expatriates living abroad.)
In addition to illegal immigrants from China and Vietnam, there are actually many illegal immigrants from Malaysia in the UK, but their mobility is more ""safe.""

Malaysia's ""jumping plane"" tide

Malaysia was once an important exporter of tin mines in the world. However, after the collapse of tin prices in the late 1980s, a large number of Chinese towns that were originally engaged in tin mining were caught in economic difficulties. In particular, Chinese with lower education levels suffered the most from unemployment. In order to change their lives, they had to ""jump the plane.""
The so-called ""jumping plane"" refers to the common name for those Chinese who want to go to developed countries, such as the British, Australian, and Japanese black-skinned workers, to purchase illegal airline tickets and enter the local area. Although Malaysia’s economy has grown in recent years, a small number of people are also flying in Australia and even seeking refugee shelter. According to the Australian government's statistics in 2018, the three major countries of origin for asylum seekers in the year are: Malaysia (5858), China (1561), and Vietnam (465).
Tang Nanfa said that Malaysia is not a very poor country and its economic development is barely strong. However, Malaysian citizens are more fortunate than Vietnamese. Malaysia’s passport is visa-free in many countries, and it is also a Commonwealth country. Therefore, Malaysian citizens It is possible to apply for refugees after entering Australia, and the same is true of the Malaysians who saw the ""jumping plane"" in the United Kingdom.
Once in the Malay Peninsula, Ganzhou and Negeri Sembilan were important producers of tin mines. Therefore, after the tin mining industry, the Chinese who jumped to the UK also came from these two states, especially Ganzhou. Tang Nanfa explained that the reason why most Malaysian Chinese people jumped to Europe at the terminal was only in the UK, because the Chinese community in the UK is mainly Cantonese and Fuzhou, and the Chinese in Zhangzhou are mostly Guangfu, and some Fuzhou people, so working in London has the convenience of language communication. Many Hong Kong restaurant owners in London are also happy to hire Luzhou Chinese who know Cantonese. As for the Chinese community in Europe, such as Italy, most of them are from Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Most of the Malaysian Chinese in the southern provinces of China are not allowed to jump in the European countries because of the lack of dialects in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. (Editor's note: The Guangfu people are native speakers of Cantonese and from the Lingnan region of China.)
Tang Nanfa said that although he often criticized Prime Minister Mahathir on the domestic political issues of Malaysia, he still affirmed Mahathir’s efforts in the early 1990s to seek visa-free treatment for European countries, plus Malaysia’s The Commonwealth countries, therefore, the gold content of Malaysian passports is quite high. Tang Nanfa remembers that he was asked whether he could sell a personal passport in the Fuzhou market in the Czech Republic. The other party offered a price of tens of thousands of RM, and he certainly refused.
Tang Nanfa further pointed out that compared with the situation of Vietnamese and Chinese people who sneaked through the Snake Group collectively, the Malaysian Chinese who want to fly the plane are mostly arranged by the travel agency to travel to the European continent for a few days before entering the British ""sightseeing"". Eventually left in the form of ""lost."" Tang Nanfa said that some travel agencies would even help the plane-journey to contact the connector people in the UK (mostly Malaysians) to find a job in the local area.
The Henry Passport Index for 2019 shows that Malaysian passports rank 13th in the global visa-free list, China ranks 74th, and Vietnam ranks 95th. The same rankings as Vietnam are also in Laos, Egypt, Jordan, Angola and Haiti. Vietnamese passports have been relatively low internationally.

The attraction of overseas Vietnamese communities to native Vietnamese

In recent years, the Vietnamese news that has been seen in Taiwan, in addition to the negative news of local environmental pollution and strikes in Taiwanese factories, as well as the economic take-off of Vietnam and the transfer of effects brought about by the Sino-US trade war have made Vietnam profitable. News, so why does Vietnam still have a 39-year-old Essex frozen container crash in the seemingly promising trend?
""You said that he (Vietnamese) is poor, but he is not really poor enough to eat. If he can borrow two or three thousand pounds to take the risk, it means that there are fewer job opportunities in the province. Tang Nanfa said.
British television station CHANNEL 4 reported that suspected relatives were Vietnamese families killed in the dead container of the frozen container 39. Most of them came from the coastal provinces in the central part. The local fishermen suffered from marine pollution, the fishing was reduced, and the livelihood was affected. Many people had to take the risk to the UK to work as a blacksmith. . The news piece of CHANNEL 4 also mentioned that in 2016, Vietnamese people broke out in protest against Taiwanese enterprises polluting the oceans and killing their livelihoods. In April 2016, Formosa Plastics Vietnam’s Hejing Iron and Steel Plant caused pollution of the Vietnamese coast due to the discharge of wastewater. The company’s payment of 500 million US dollars in compensation from the Vietnamese government, but in June this year, nearly 100 Vietnamese people came to Taiwan for the 7875. The plaintiff sued 24 shareholders and directors of Formosa Steel Plant for compensation of NT$140 million. The Free Times reported that most of the 7875 plaintiffs were fishing boat owners, salt producers, fishery-related workers, and divers in four provinces including Hejing, Guangping, Guangzhi and Yi'an in central Vietnam.
Therefore, Tang Nanfa believes that some people will think that even if they work in the economically developed Ho Chi Minh City, how many years can they work to build a house in their hometown? Some of the fellow villagers who work overseas have built a house with the help of remittances from their hometowns, which has shaped the imagination of local natives to work overseas. They believe that working overseas is worthwhile, and the development of social media is more consolidated. This impression. Therefore, some Vietnamese prefer to sneak overseas and are not willing to work in other provinces.


""No Vulnerability: The Story of Vietnamese Boat People"" by Huang Weihui Photo Credit: Du Jinxuan

Huang Yuhui is a folk researcher who has been involved in the Vietnamese refugees in the 1970s. He is the author of ""No Vulnerability: The Story of Vietnamese Boat People."" Huang Yuhui and the ""Key Review Network"" said that the tide of refugees erupted after the reunification of the North and South, caused the Vietnamese to scatter abroad and form many Vietnamese communities in Europe, the United States, Canada and other regions. She pointed out that although the Vietnamese economy is developing, the rural areas have not really benefited. The phenomenon of working abroad to earn foreign exchange is still widespread. Although Europe is farther away from the Asian regions where Vietnamese citizens such as Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan can legally work, Britain, Germany, France, and even some former Warsaw Convention countries have quite complete discrete Vietnamese communities. Therefore, whether they are legal or not, they will always find someone to go to the local area and have the opportunity to be assigned to a nail shop to work, or to Illegal cannabis plantation work.
Huang Huihui remembers that Canada has not legalized cannabis cultivation more than 20 years ago, and the Canadian government has vigorously cracked down on cannabis plantations. Since growers are mostly planted in rented houses, they are commonly known as ""marijuana houses"". These tenants use unusually large amounts of electricity, which has become a clue to the Canadian government's tracing. In the past, many Vietnamese were planting cannabis.
In the case of the above-mentioned remittances for the benefit of their hometown, Tang Nanfa said that this is the same as the Malaysian who had previously fled the plane. No matter how hard they work in London or Tokyo, they will not tell their families about the bitterness of working overseas. Most of them are not happy with their reports. If they say they can earn three or four hundred pounds a week in the UK, this may not be the case. The people in my hometown listened, and naturally hoped for it, and the human snake group naturally saw this mentality.
Tang Nanfa stressed that even if Vietnamese people successfully borrowed money to sneak into overseas, they were forced to become ""modern slaves"" when they were heavily in debt, forced to work at low wages overseas, and women were at risk of being forced into prostitution. And they can't run away, because the Snake Group knows which town they come from, and it can be dangerous for their families. Tang Nanfa cited the data of the British NGO Anti-Slaver as an example. From 2009 to 2018, as many as 3,187 Vietnamese citizens were identified as potential victims of human trafficking, including hundreds of children.
On the other hand, because Vietnamese people want to apply for overseas work, they need to be dealt with through layers of relations. Therefore, some local Communist leaders are also agents. Tang Nanfa used the case he had dealt with. For example, a Vietnamese person colluded with Zhongshang because of his local leadership. Although he successfully brought him to work in Malaysia, he was defrauded and owed by the intermediary. Finally he fled and returned to Vietnam to find The leader settled the account and the leader turned to the police to beat him.
Finally, Tang Nanfa reminded that political changes in the UK are also factors that affect the influx of illegal immigrants in Asia. In the past few years when Britain decided to leave the European Union, the shifting jobs in Eastern Europe, which were originally engaged in low-level labor in the UK, have left the UK. This has created a huge manpower gap and needs Asian labor to fill it. Tang Nanfa believes that Britain is not only the country that relies most on foreign labor migration in Europe, but also the country that excludes them the most.
