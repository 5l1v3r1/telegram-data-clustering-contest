Allie, 42 and Brian Anderson, 50, allegedly did not call 911 to report the overdose until more than an hour after she was dead on the night of October 21, 2017.
Delaware County Sheriff Harlan Moore told local station KOTV Allie Anderson had told police she had been friends with Vermillion since they were eight years old.
Police reportedly suspect the couple wanted Vermillion dead so she couldn't testify agaist them in a drug trafficking case.
Moore said police recovered a video camera that police alleged was used to record Vermillion's death scene.
The couple had been suspects in the case since Vermillion's death two years ago but it wasn't until a confidential informant came forward that authorities were able to lay charges.
Neither of the Andersons have entered a plea.
