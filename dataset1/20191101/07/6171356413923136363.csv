ASUS shares list of 120fps games for the ROG Phone II (Update: New games)

 Update 2: 2019/11/01 12:38am PDTMore new games

ASUS announced the ROG Phone II earlier this year, and it is truly a beast of a smartphone, featuring up to 1TB of storage, a Snapdragon 855 Plus, 12GB of RAM, and a 120Hz display. With the September launch date inching closer, the company is sharing which games will support the high-refresh-rate screen, plus a couple more that barely surpass 60fps.
While the vast majority of games only support regular displays capable of outputting a maximum of 60fps, ASUS and other manufacturers could convince quite a few developers to adjust their products for faster screens. It's great to see classics like Alto's Adventure, Riptide GP, Plague Inc, Don't Starve, and even Temple Run 2 on the list, supporting the full 120fps. We have to call out ASUS for including Heart Star with 65fps and three more games with 70fps, though – that barely qualifies as high-frame-rate gaming.
Many of the games included in the list can also be found through the ROG Phone's own Armoury Crate app.

Update 1: 2019/09/27 1:10pm PDT by Manuel Vonau


New games and a removal

ASUS just updated the list of games and added a disclaimer saying support for high fps gaming ""can break at any given time if/when the game developer makes changes to their game - and we are not in control over this."" Sure enough, Sky Force Reloaded has been removed from the overview while three new games have been added:

Minecraft Earth - 120fps
BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! - 120fps
Into Mirror - 120fps

We've updated the original list above accordingly.
End of Update
