The Morning After: Apple TV+ has arrived
And a peek inside the AirPods Pro.
01 Nov 2019, 07:15 by Richard Lawler
Hey, good morning! You look fabulous.
Halloween is over, and Apple TV+ is here. It's November, and before we fall back this weekend -- yes, it's that time of year in the US -- we have a name for Fisker's fantastical new SUV and a chance to peek inside Apple's professional AirPods.


Deliveries are anticipated in 2022.


Fisker's affordable all-electric SUV is called Ocean




Now Fisker is back, it's building a sub-$40,000 electric SUV, and that vehicle has a name: Ocean. Fisker will forego building a show car and debut what it says is ""a fully running production-intent prototype sitting on the actual, completely engineered platform"" on January 4th, 2020. That's after the company releases a mobile app that people can use to manage its leases, which will not have a long-term contract. Oh, and the Ocean has a full-length solar roof to go along with its 80 kWh battery pack.


Someone needed another streaming service.


Apple TV+ shows and movies premiere today




Now it's November, we've reached the release date of Apple's streaming video service, Apple TV+. The Apple TV+ service will cost $4.99 per month, but there's a seven-day free trial available to everyone, and if you purchase new hardware -- iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV or Mac -- then there's a free year waiting. At launch, viewers can choose between new episodes of For All Mankind, The Morning Show, See, Helpsters, Dickinson, Ghostwriter, Snoopy in Space and Oprah's Book Club.


Creepy.


Instagram is trying to shut down Like Patrol




Like Patrol sends notifications to users whenever their target likes or comments on an Instagram post, and it provides analytics, such as gender and even attractiveness, about who they're interacting with. Originally, Like Patrol referenced data from Instagram's own creepy Following tab, which showed who a user interacted with, their conversations and more. When Instagram discontinued the Following tab, Like Patrol developed its own scraping algorithms to track interactions -- now the social network has sent out a cease-and-desist order.


They're no easier to repair than the originals.


AirPods Pro have replaceable components but aren't repairable




Early adopters are already testing out Apple's newest wireless buds (review incoming), but don't expect them to last a lifetime. While the AirPods Pro pack more conventional components -- especially the batteries -- iFixit found that they're no more repairable than the OG AirPods, thanks to a lot of glue in their construction. Those new silicone tips? If you need more, you'll have to get them from Apple. Existing third-party ones won't fit.


With the chin you'd expect.


Motorola's foldable display RAZR leaks in first official-looking images




A more official-looking leaked image of the reinvented RAZR, a Motorola flip phone with a foldable display, has surfaced. It has a chunky lip at the base for the top half to fold into, flush. In general, it looks more like the RAZR of old than you might have expected, though other rumors suggest a more contemporary spec sheet, including a Snapdragon 710 processor and 256 gigs of storage. We're expecting official confirmation of the new foldable on November 13th.


You'll have to enable the feature and confirm your fingerprint first.


WhatsApp's fingerprint unlock feature finally arrives on Android




Earlier this year, WhatsApp added an extra layer of privacy for iOS users when it enabled support for Touch ID and Face ID on iPhones and iPads. Now Android has caught up. WhatsApp users can unlock the app with their fingerprint once it's enabled in settings. The messaging company hasn't said whether it would bring face unlock capabilities for Android phones with the feature.
But wait, there's more...


Tipping point: The gig economy hits delivery drivers in their wallets


Apple Card users get 24-month interest-free financing on iPhones


Aaron Sorkin rails on Zuckerberg in open letter


Toronto is reining in Sidewalk Labs' smart city dream


Hackers breached some of the web's most popular domain registrars


Is the iPad Air the 'just right' tablet for most people?


Face Darth Vader himself in the final episode of his Oculus VR saga
