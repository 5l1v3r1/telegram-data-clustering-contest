區塊鏈概念股一天半即閃崩 權貴割韭菜無視習近平面子

01 Nov 2019, 07:46

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】上週日，中共官媒報導了習近平要大力發展區塊鏈技術應用的講話後，次日中國股市有關區塊鏈概念股一度出現百股暴漲，但熱度僅維持一天半即出現大範圍閃崩。專家學者稱，中共權貴借勢「割韭菜」，都懶得再顧及習近平的面子，倒霉的還是普通散戶股民。
中共中央政治局本月24日舉行了有關區塊鏈技術發展現狀和趨勢的專題學習，習近平在這次集體學習會上講話時，力捧區塊鏈技術的應用，把加緊發展區塊鏈形容為「未來國家發展方向的重要核心」之一，並暗示將會投入國家力量全力支持發展區塊鏈。中共官媒27日報導了上述消息後，第二天（28日）的中國股市上便出現了區塊鏈概念股集體暴漲的現象，一度有近百股漲停。比特幣的市場價格也一路走高，一度暴升40%，高見10,332美元。
不過好景不長，中國區塊鏈概念股的這次爆漲熱度僅維持了1天半，到29日下午即出現大多數涉區塊鏈概念的股票陡然暴跌的現象。
據自由亞洲電台報導，領跌的古鰲科技、新晨科技、東方網力、華美控股等個股資料顯示，數十支區塊鏈相關股票的股價暴跌的原因，是機構主力資金大規模抽離，而廣大普通散戶則再次成為了中共權貴們「割韭菜」的對象。
報導表示，過去在習近平講話的帶動下，雄安新區、國產晶片概念股也曾一度暴漲後又暴跌，但當時的熱度一般都維持了7到10天的週期，但這次的區塊鏈熱度卻只維持了一天半，創下了習近平捧場熱度的最短紀錄。
針對這種情形，華為大資料原工程師金淳在接受自由亞洲電台採訪時驚嘆，如今中共權貴們「割韭菜」的速度之快，甚至都懶得顧及習近平的面子。
金淳說：「國內的資本市場，其實都是被控制的，就是說，它沒有能力托這個盤了唄。都是既得利益群體，大部份都是權貴家族了。等於是說他們互相之間攪局，他們打習近平的耳光，也很正常啊。習近平他講個話，既得利益階層第一天可能會給個面子，然後幫他炒作一下，順便騙一下其他人。第二天就要拋掉了。」
金淳還強調，中國官方重視區塊鏈，並不是欣賞區塊鏈的去中心化的精髓，而是試圖尋找到一種可以控制區塊鏈及其關聯產品的技術。比如，如果掌握了區塊鏈話語權後，其可以像任意操控國內金融和股市一下，既是裁判又是運動員，並以此掌控更大的國際政治經濟話語權。
據公開的資訊，區塊鏈的特性之一是數據不可篡改且可追溯，這項技術的本身是一個去中心化的分布式帳本數據庫，也就是一串使用密碼學相關聯所產生的數據塊，每一個數據塊中包含了多次交易有效確認的信息，可以在確保網絡隱私、辨別假冒商品，以及保存記錄等領域發揮重要作用。
不過，有專家指出，再先進的科學技術，一旦到了中共手裏都會變質，就像互聯網在中國就變成了大局域網一樣，區塊鏈也不例外。
中共國務院發展研究中心助理研究員吳桐曾公開揚言，中國發展的區塊鏈不會成為監管外之物，而會成為「監管的牙齒」和「新的治理工具」。不僅不會去中心化，還會通過資訊集成化等管道來提高政府的調控能力。
而中國經濟觀察人士秦鵬對大紀元表示，中共現在要大力提倡區塊鏈，並提高到國家戰略高度，要搶占先機，主要出於監控、爭奪金融霸權以及擴張實現人類命運共同體三個目的。

The blockchain concept stocks are flashing in a day and a half.

01 Nov 2019, 07:46

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 01, 2019] On Sunday, the Chinese Communist Party officially reported that Xi Jinping should vigorously develop the application of blockchain technology. The next day, the stock market chain stocks in China’s stock market once skyrocketed. However, the heat only lasted for one and a half days, and a large range of flash collapse occurred. Experts and scholars said that the CCP’s privilege to take advantage of the trend of “cutting leeks” is too lazy to take into account the face of Xi Jinping, and the unlucky ones are ordinary retail investors.
The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a special study on the status quo and trends of blockchain technology development on the 24th of this month. When Xi Jinping spoke at this collective study meeting, he advocated the application of blockchain technology and described the intensified development blockchain as One of the ""important cores of the future development of the country"", and hinted that it will invest in the national power to fully support the development blockchain. After the CCP’s official media reported the above news on the 27th, the second day (28th) of the Chinese stock market, there was a phenomenon of blockchain stocks rising collectively. At one time, there were nearly one hundred daily limit. The market price of Bitcoin also rose all the way, once rising 40%, and seeing a high of $10,332.
However, the good times did not last long. The Chinese blockchain concept stocks only lasted for one and a half days. By the afternoon of the 29th, most of the stocks involved in the blockchain concept suddenly fell sharply.
According to Free Asia Radio, the leading stocks of Gushun Technology, Xinchen Technology, Dongfang Netpower, Huamei Holdings and other stocks show that the stock price of dozens of blockchain-related stocks plummeted because of the large-scale withdrawal of the main funds of the institutions. However, the majority of ordinary retail investors have once again become the object of the CCP’s dignitaries.
According to the report, in the past, driven by Xi Jinping's speech, Xiong'an New District and domestic wafer concept stocks once plunged and then plummeted, but the heat at that time generally lasted for 7 to 10 days, but this time the blockchain heat Only lasted for one and a half days, setting the shortest record of Xi Jinping's popularity.
In response to this situation, Jin Hao, the original engineer of Huawei's big data, was amazed by the interview with Radio Free Asia. Nowadays, the CCP's dignitaries are “cutting the leeks” at a fast pace, and even lazy to take into account Xi Jinping's face.
Kim Min said: ""The domestic capital market is actually controlled. That is to say, it does not have the ability to support this. It is a vested interest group, most of which are powerful families. It is equal to say that they are each other. It’s normal to play Xi Jinping’s slap in the face. Xi Jinping said a word, the vested interests may give a face on the first day, then help him speculate, and fool others. By the next day, he will throw Lost.""
Kim Min also stressed that the Chinese government attaches importance to the blockchain, not to appreciate the essence of the decentralization of the blockchain, but to try to find a technology that can control the blockchain and its related products. For example, if you master the right of blockchain, you can control domestic finance and stock market as you like, and it is both a referee and an athlete, and thus control the greater international political and economic discourse power.
According to published information, one of the characteristics of the blockchain is that the data cannot be tampered and traceable. The technology itself is a decentralized distributed ledger database, which is a string of data generated using cryptography. Blocks, each of which contains information for valid confirmation of multiple transactions, can play an important role in ensuring network privacy, identifying counterfeit goods, and keeping records.
However, some experts pointed out that once advanced science and technology will deteriorate in the hands of the CCP, just as the Internet has become a large local area network in China, the blockchain is no exception.
Wu Tong, an assistant researcher at the Development Research Center of the State Council, has publicly threatened that China's development of blockchain will not become a matter of regulation, but will become a ""regulatory tooth"" and a ""new governance tool."" Not only will it not be decentralized, but it will also improve the government's ability to regulate and control through channels such as information integration.
Qin Peng, a Chinese economic observer, told the Epoch Times that the CCP should now vigorously promote the blockchain and raise it to the national strategic level, and must seize the opportunity, mainly for monitoring, competing for financial hegemony and expanding the realization of the community of human destiny. .
