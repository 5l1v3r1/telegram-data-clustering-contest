""With England touring the country during the same period, this will make for an exciting sequence of events in Sri Lanka and, as one of the best cricketing destinations in the world, it will be a wonderful occasion for all involved. I am looking forward to playing for and indeed captaining the MCC team, which will be full of exciting young talent ready to challenge the County Champions,"" Sangakkara added.
Sri Lanka Cricket Cheif Shami Silva has acknowledged this announcement from MCC and has thanked them for showing faith in Sri Lankan Cricket. He is extremely pleased to host this event and believes that it will bring more audiences and provide greater exposure to cricket in the island nation.
""Sri Lanka Cricket wishes to thank MCC for choosing Sri Lanka as its venue to play the MCC Champion County Match in 2020, which we consider as an honour and a privilege bestowed upon the cricket-loving public of our country,"" Silva said.
""We are happy to be the host of this historic encounter, which marks the curtain-raiser to the new English domestic season. It is also very fitting that this team is led by none other than our own Kumar Sangakkara, who has recently become the first non-British MCC President,"" he concluded.
