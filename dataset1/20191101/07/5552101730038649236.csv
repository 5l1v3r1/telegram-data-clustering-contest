01 Nov 2019, 07:20 by 徐珍翔
日前，星宇航空董事長張國煒親自駕駛國內首架A321neo客機抵台，緊接著由星宇機隊接棒，展開為期一週的北、高往返訓練飛行，星宇航空臉書粉絲團則同步公告「照飛機」活動，祭出首獎「不限航點單人商務艙來回機票」，邀請粉絲一起捕捉新機的身影，成功延續話題熱度，也凝聚粉絲向心力。
有別於老牌航空公司，星宇航空自成立以來，始終在「空戰」上掌握先機，為凝聚粉絲向心力，並延續話題熱度，日前在臉書粉絲團祭出重賞，邀請網友一起「照飛機」。
星宇航空的粉絲以年輕族群為主，臉書也相當幽默，日前還將A321neo客機擬人化，趁著南北試飛的空檔接受小編訪問，「第一次回家的感動超乎預期，由衷感謝台灣民眾在試飛期間給予了滿滿滿的注目禮，確實有些Shining like stars的錯覺。」
貼文更偷渡徵稿訊息：「高雄小港機場其它機型老大哥也熱情地和我分享，這些天沙塵隨東北風南下影響台灣，從高空看下一片灰濛濛，期待落塵狀況穩定後，還有機會能讓航空迷拍到我和湛藍天空的完美作品。」
星宇航空指出，此次「照飛機」活動將持續至11月30日，民眾只要將攝影作品上傳到Facebook或Instagram，打上標籤「星宇照飛機」、「STARtracker」、「使用器材」，將分享權限設定為公開，就可以參加評選，首獎為「不限航點單人商務艙來回機票」一名，二獎一名也有「不限航點單人經濟艙來回機票」，目前搜尋關鍵字已可看見不少作品。

[Xingyu K Dongzizi Wang] K Dong has a set of air combat, invites fans to ""take the plane"" first prize to send tickets
01 Nov 2019, 07:20 by Xu Zhenxiang
A few days ago, Zhang Guofan, the chairman of Xingyu Airlines, personally drove the first A321neo passenger plane in China, and then the star-studded fleet took over and launched a week-long round-trip training flight. The Xingyu Aviation Facebook fan group announced simultaneously. ""According to the aircraft"" event, the first prize ""no-round single business class round-trip ticket"" was offered, and fans were invited to capture the new machine, successfully continuing the topic, and also concentrating the fans.
Different from the old airlines, since its establishment, Xingyu Airlines has always grasped the opportunities in the ""air battle"", in order to unite the fans, and continue the topic of heat, recently in the Facebook fan group to pay a reward, invite netizens to ""photo aircraft"".
The fans of Xingyu Airlines are mainly young people, and Facebook is quite humorous. Recently, the A321neo passenger plane was anthropomorphized, and the interview with the North-South test flight was accepted by Xiaobian. ""The first time I went home, I was moved beyond expectations. I am grateful to the people of Taiwan for their full attention during the flight test. There are indeed some illusions of Shining like stars.""
Posts sneaked over the message: ""The other big brothers at Kaohsiung Xiaogang Airport also enthusiastically shared with me. These days, the sand dust affects Taiwan with the northeast wind, and it looks gray from a high altitude. After expecting a stable dust situation, there is still a chance. The perfect work that allows aviation fans to capture me and the blue sky.""
Xingyu Airlines pointed out that the ""Let's Plane"" campaign will last until November 30th. People will upload photos to Facebook or Instagram and tag them ""Xingyu Photo Aircraft"", ""STARtracker"" and ""Use Equipment"". If the sharing authority is set to be public, you can participate in the selection. The first prize is one of the ""no-one-way single business class round-trip ticket"", and the second prize also has ""no-one-way single-economy round-trip ticket"". Many works have been seen in the word.
