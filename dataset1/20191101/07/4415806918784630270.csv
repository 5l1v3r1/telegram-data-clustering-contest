What the papers say
Crystal Palace are interested in securing Liverpool forward Rhian Brewster on loan in the January window, The Sun reports. The 19-year-old forward is also being watched by Bristol City and Swansea and some German sides if he is made available on a short-term contract. Brewster gained the Golden Boot after he helped England win their maiden Under-17 World Cup in 2017.
The 21-year-old Czech midfielder Alex Kral could be leaving Spartak Moscow for the Premier League, according to the Norwich Evening News. The young player’s role in the stunning 2-1 Euro 2020 defeat of England in October has marked him as a target for Norwich, Everton and Newcastle.
