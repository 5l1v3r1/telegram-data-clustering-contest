女星林予晞在TVBS《天堂的微笑》與資深實力派演員李璇扮演婆媳，先前李璇以「太后」之姿出場，氣勢凌人，引起廣大觀眾朋友討論。不過林予晞卻爆料李璇其實私底下個性相當溫柔，演出婆媳衝突戲後，李璇還特地向她道歉，反差之大讓林予晞感到意外。
《天堂的微笑》前兩集播出後，由李璇所飾演的「孫媽」梁如真令網友印象深刻，對於孫媽帶著「求子偏方」到公司要媳婦趙承舒（林予晞　飾）喝下，網友一度激動留言「這根本就是惡婆婆」、「讓人喘不過氣」。談到與李璇對戲的過程，林予晞說：「璇姊本人非常溫柔，是小女人的那種溫柔，所以演衝突戲的時候都覺得好為難她。」

即將登場的第三集，李璇與林予晞婆媳倆為了孩子教養問題正面槓上，林予晞說：「吵架戲一喊卡，璇姊就會跑來跟大家道歉，說自己好凶、好不應該，她真的好萌。」林予晞透露身邊也有與「孫媽」相似個性的長輩，「我奶奶基本上就是這樣類型的長輩，小時候很怕跟她相處，因為她對我們的言行品性、生活習慣要求非常嚴格，很少看到她笑。」
修杰楷在劇中夾在媽媽與老婆之間，他說：「孫又翔雖然是媽媽單獨帶大，但他真的不是『媽寶』，不會什麼事都聽媽媽的話，該替老婆說話的時候也一定會跳出來。」至於現實生活中他則透露從未碰過婆媳問題，飾演孫又翔讓他有了全新的人生體驗。

The actress Lin Yuxi plays the mother-in-law in the TVBS ""Smile of Heaven"" and the senior power actor Li Wei. Previously, Li Wei appeared in the ""Taiwan"" posture, and the momentum was astounding, causing the audience to discuss. However, Lin Yuxi broke the news that Li Wei was actually very gentle in private. After the performance of the conflict between the mother and daughter, Li Wei also specifically apologized to her. The contrast was so surprised that Lin Yuzhen was surprised.
After the first two episodes of ""Smile of Heaven"", the ""Sun Mama"" Liang Ruzhen, played by Li Wei, impressed the netizens. For the mother, she took the ""seeking remedies"" to the company to marry Zhao Chengshu (Lin Yuxi). Netizens were excited to leave a message ""This is simply a bad mother-in-law"" and ""a breathless person."" When talking about the process of playing against Li Wei, Lin Yuxi said: ""I am very gentle, it is the gentleness of a small woman, so when I play a conflict, I feel that it is difficult for her.""

In the third episode to be debuted, Li Wei and Lin Yuxi and her wife are on the front of the problem of raising their children. Lin Yuxi said: ""A quarrel will be called, and you will come to apologize to everyone, saying that you are so fierce, good or not, she It’s really cute.” Lin Yuxi revealed that there are also elders with similar personalities to “Sun Ma”. “My grandmother is basically such a type of elder. When I was young, I was afraid to get along with her because she asked us about their character and habits. Very strict, rarely seeing her laughing.""
In the play, Xiu Jieyu was sandwiched between his mother and his wife. He said: ""Although Sun Youxiang is a mother who is alone, but he is really not a ""mother"", he will not listen to his mother's words, and he will also talk to his wife. It will definitely jump out."" As for real life, he revealed that he had never touched the issue of mother-in-law, and played Sun Youxiang to give him a new life experience.
