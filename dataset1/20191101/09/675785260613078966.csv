How to turn some of the capital in your home into tax-free cash
If you are looking to generate some extra spending money in retirement, equity release is a safe and increasingly popular way of raising the money you need

Equity release is available to those aged 55 or over, with a UK property worth at least £70,000.
It allows you to unlock some of the capital sitting idle in your home and turn it into tax-free cash that you can spend on doing up your home, easing financial worries, taking a holiday or helping your family.
A big attraction is that you do not have to sell your home or make any debt repayments while you are alive. Instead the total debt is usually cleared from the sale of your property after you die or go into long-term care. Until then, you and your partner have a guaranteed right to continue living in your home for the rest of your lives.
Your home is almost certainly your biggest asset, and that means you want to be certain that you are doing the right thing.
One of the most important features to look out for is something called a no-negative equity guarantee. This pledges that when your property is sold, following your death or when you move into long-term care, neither you nor your loved ones will owe more than your home is worth. The guarantee applies regardless of what happens to house prices in the years ahead.
Safeguards like these are boosting confidence in equity release , and the number of customers is steadily rising.
