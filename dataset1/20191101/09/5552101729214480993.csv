01 Nov 2019, 09:03 by 蔡世偉
伊甸基金會無障礙生活節活動邁入第6屆，今年以「微老小鎮」為主題打造關卡，從2日到4日連續3天在台北松山文創園區一號倉庫，邀民眾親自來體驗變老的感覺，更特別請來甫敲響金鐘的公益大使溫昇豪，希望透過他的親身體驗，邀民眾一起換位思考。
今年榮獲金鐘獎戲劇節目男配角獎的溫昇豪近日受邀擔任伊甸基金會無障礙生活節公益大使，除了拍攝宣傳主視覺及公益影片外，也特別出席參與今（1日）舉行的無障礙生活節活動。而在與爺爺奶奶的拍攝過程中，風趣幽默的溫昇豪總能打破長輩的心防和緊張，即使在嚴肅緊湊的工作現場，也讓素人奶奶能放鬆拍攝，呈現最動人可愛的畫面。

這次親自體驗「微老小鎮」，溫昇豪表示，青壯年時大家生活節奏都快，總是趕著工作、忙著生活，但隨著視覺、聽覺甚至行動上的功能退化，真的會感到很無助，就像原先也很難想像當眼睛看不見時，生活會有許多不便，連想看幾點都很吃力；更不用說輪椅體驗的時候，平常隨意就能跨過的落差都變成高牆似的，要是再加上其他身體功能退化，真的會連出門都有點怕怕的。
溫昇豪深刻了解到對於長輩來說「陪伴」才是最重要的，希望藉由公益站台及無障礙生活節的參與，號召民眾關注老人議題，邀請民眾一起陪伴多一點、讓愛再多一點點，關懷同理你我生活週遭的老寶貝，讓他們的生活不會只有漫漫無期的等待與孤獨，能夠與溫暖關懷一起笑開來。

Wen Shenghao hangs on the eve of the night, and calls on the elders to accompany the most important

The Eden Foundation Accessible Life Festival is in its sixth year. This year, the theme of the ""Micro-Old Town"" will be built. From the 2nd to the 4th, it will be held in Taipei No. 1 warehouse in Songshan Wenchuang Park for 3 consecutive days. To experience the feeling of getting older, I would like to invite Wen Shenghao, the charity ambassador who is ringing the Admiralty, to hope that through his personal experience, the people will be invited to exchange ideas.
Wen Shenghao, who won the Golden Jubilee Drama Show Supporting Actor Award this year, was recently invited to serve as the public welfare ambassador for the Eden Foundation's Accessible Life Festival. In addition to filming the main visual and public interest videos, he also attended the participation barrier today (1st). Life festival activities. In the process of shooting with grandparents, the humorous Wen Shenghao can always break the heart and defense of the elders. Even in the serious and compact work scene, the aunt can relax and shoot, showing the most attractive and lovely picture.

This time, I personally experienced the ""small old town"". Wen Shenghao said that when young and old, everyone has a fast pace of life, always rushing to work and busy life, but with the deterioration of function in vision, hearing and even action, I really feel very Helpless, just as it was originally difficult to imagine, when the eyes are invisible, life will have a lot of inconvenience, even if you want to see a few points, it is very difficult; not to mention the wheelchair experience, the gap that you usually cross can be turned into a high wall. It seems that if other physical functions are degraded, it will be a little scary to go out.
Wen Shenghao deeply understands that ""companion"" is the most important thing for the elders. I hope that through the participation of the public welfare platform and the accessible life festival, people will be called upon to pay attention to the issue of the elderly, invite the people to accompany them more, and let the love be a little bit more. Caring for the old babies around you and my life, so that their lives will not only have long waiting and loneliness, can laugh with warm care.
