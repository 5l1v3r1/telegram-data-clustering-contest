魏德聖史詩格局三級跳　135億打造「臺灣三部曲文化園區」
01 Nov 2019, 09:29 by 項貽斐
導演魏德聖心心念念的史詩電影《臺灣三部曲》又往前邁進一步！因應該片規劃的「臺灣三部曲歷史文化園區BOT案」於今（1）日舉辦簽約記者會，該案由台南市政府委託魏德聖團隊規劃，片中17世紀台灣西拉雅人、漢人、荷蘭人的生活世界將在台南市後壁區搭建並保留再改造擴增為「豐盛之城」（Formosa Wonderland）多功能文化園區。
對台灣歷史有深厚興趣的魏德聖，繼《賽德克‧巴萊》《KANO》後，挑戰更大規模的史詩電影《臺灣三部曲》，透過3部電影重現17世紀的台灣。3部電影都將以荷蘭人來了、鄭成功來了為開場及結束，並分別以西拉雅獵人、漢人海盜與荷蘭傳教士的角度講述不同觀點的歷史故事。
魏德聖企圖藉《臺灣三部曲》重現「17世紀大航海時代台灣在世界舞台初登場」的樣貌，格局遠超過之前的電影，因此他希望影片的拍攝場景可以保存、永續利用。為此在魏德聖領軍下，規劃「臺灣三部曲歷史文化園區」，幾經尋覓接洽，終於確定落腳台南，並以BOT案方式與台南市府合作。

「臺灣三部曲歷史文化園區」位於台南市後壁區烏樹林，緊鄰台灣蘭花生物科技園區，面積達118公頃，園區內將規劃一片海洋（台江內海）、2座城堡（熱蘭遮城、普羅民遮城）、3種文化（西拉雅人、漢人、荷蘭人）、4個主題村（熱蘭遮海陸市鎮、赤崁漢人移墾聚落、海盜村、西拉雅原住民部落），並將完成包括《臺灣三部曲》與1部動畫電影、1部紀錄片等5部影片。其中《臺灣三部曲》預計在2021年下半年開鏡，2023年正式開拍、2025年配合園區開幕同時上映。
魏德聖導演《臺灣三部曲》將首次嘗試主場景「邊蓋邊拍」的拍攝模式，3部電影也將同時拍攝。負責場景設計的日本美術團隊表示，故事背景時代久遠，參考歷史資料有限、加上「搭景」將留存為園區永久性建築，挑戰難度很高。《臺灣三部曲》除在臺灣本島拍攝，場景範圍還擴及金門、澎湖，甚至日本沖繩諸島及歐洲的荷蘭，規模龐大。
因電影應運而生、將永久保存的「臺灣三部曲歷史文化園區」設計也同步進行，園區結合電影主題，將分別規劃歐式風情的熱蘭遮海陸市鎮，讓遊客體驗東、西文化撞擊；自然原始的西拉雅原住民村落，集結南島語族海洋文化，搭配展現生態親水體驗；充滿庶民文化的赤崁漢人聚落，除可一覽傳統民俗活動，還原建造普羅民遮城（今赤崁樓前身）也是一大亮點；展現古代海盜工藝技術的海盜村，能欣賞職人專業技術，還可親自打造工藝品。
園區內也將規劃獨特主題的表演秀，結合科技藝術與五感技術，帶領遊客身歷其境走進電影故事裡，搖身一變成17世紀的人物角色。4個主題鮮明的區域，加上運用最新技術的設施與表演，將開創旅遊產業的新格局。
「臺灣三部曲歷史文化園區」總投資規模預估高達135億元，是《賽德克・巴萊》的數十倍之多。魏德聖形容：「就像嘉南平原的農民一樣，這次我們種下的是文化的種子！」他也透露，拍攝電影與園區興建初步階段的預算為20億，目前募集2億多資金，希望各界共襄盛舉。

Wei Desheng's epic pattern triple jump 13.5 billion to create ""Taiwan Trilogy Culture Park""
01 Nov 2019, 09:29 by Xiang Fei
The epic film ""Taiwan Trilogy"" directed by Wei Desheng is going further! The ""Taiwan Trilogy History and Culture Park BOT Case"", which was planned by the film, was held today (1) to sign a press conference. The case was commissioned by the Tainan Municipal Government to be planned by the Wei Desheng team. In the 17th century Taiwanese Silaya, Han Chinese and Dutch The Living World will be built in the back wall area of Tainan City and will be rebuilt and expanded into a multi-purpose cultural park in Formosa Wonderland.
Wei Desheng, who has a deep interest in Taiwan's history, succeeded the larger epic film ""Taiwan Trilogy"" after ""Sidek Bale"" and ""KANO"", recreating Taiwan in the 17th century through three films. All three films will come with the Dutch, Zheng Chenggong as the opening and ending, and tell the historical stories of different viewpoints from the perspective of Silaya hunters, Han pirates and Dutch missionaries.
Wei Desheng attempted to reproduce the appearance of ""Taiwan's world stage in the 17th century voyage"" by using the ""Taiwan Trilogy"". The pattern is far more than the previous film, so he hopes that the film's shooting scene can be preserved and used forever. To this end, under the leadership of Wei Desheng, the ""Taiwan Trilogy History and Culture Park"" was planned. After several investigations, it was finally decided to settle in Tainan and cooperate with the Tainan City Government in the BOT case.

The ""Taiwan Trilogy History and Culture Park"" is located in Wushu, Houbi District, Tainan City. It is adjacent to the Taiwan Orchid Biotechnology Park and covers an area of 118 hectares. The park will plan a sea (Taiwan inner sea) and two castles (Herran City, Promenade, 3 cultures (Syrah, Han, Dutch), 4 theme villages (Renlan, Hailu Town, Chishao Hanren, Pirate Village, Silaya, Aboriginal tribe) ), and will complete five films including the Taiwan Trilogy, an animated film, and a documentary. Among them, the ""Taiwan Trilogy"" is expected to open in the second half of 2021, officially started in 2023, and will be released in conjunction with the opening of the park in 2025.
Director Wei Desheng's ""Taiwan Trilogy"" will try the shooting mode of the main scene ""Blade and Shoot"" for the first time, and three movies will be shot at the same time. The Japanese art team responsible for the scene design said that the background of the story is a long time, and the reference historical data is limited, and the ""mountain scenery"" will remain as a permanent building in the park. The challenge is very difficult. In addition to being filmed on the island of Taiwan, the Taiwan Trilogy has expanded to include Kinmen, Penghu, and even the Japanese islands of Okinawa and Europe in Europe.
The design of the ""Taiwan Trilogy History and Culture Park"", which was created by the film and will be preserved forever, will also be carried out simultaneously. The park will combine the theme of the film, and will plan the European-style hot land to cover the land of the city, so that visitors can experience the impact of the East and West cultures. Naturally original Silaya indigenous villages, which combine the marine culture of the South Island language group to show the ecological and hydrophilic experience; the Chihkan Han people who are full of the culture of the people, in addition to the traditional folk activities, restore the construction of the Promenade (now Chihkan Tower) The predecessor is also a highlight; the pirate village that displays the ancient pirate craftsmanship can appreciate the professional skills of the staff and personally create crafts.
The park will also plan a unique theme show, combining technology and five senses technology to lead visitors into the movie story and transform into a 17th century character. The four distinctive themes, combined with the latest technology facilities and performances, will create a new landscape for the tourism industry.
The total investment scale of the ""Taiwan Trilogy History and Culture Park"" is estimated to be as high as 13.5 billion yuan, which is dozens of times more than ""Sidek Bale"". Wei Desheng described: ""Like the farmers in the Canaan Plain, this time we planted the seeds of culture!"" He also revealed that the budget for filming and the initial stage of the park construction is 2 billion. Currently, more than 200 million funds are raised. A total of grand celebrations.
