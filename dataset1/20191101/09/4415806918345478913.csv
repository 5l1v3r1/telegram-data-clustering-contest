Many of the victims were members of an Islamic preaching group.
The blaze was caused by a cooking gas stove that passengers were using on board to prepare their food, something that poor Pakistanis often do although it is against safety regulations.
The train was travelling from the port city of Karachi to the city of Rawalpindi, with 857 passengers on board, when it caught fire.
