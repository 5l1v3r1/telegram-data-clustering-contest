“Having just returned from visiting Pakistan, we were horrified and deeply saddened to hear about the tragic fire on the Tezgam train near Rahim Yar Khan,” said a statement issued by the Kensington Palace.
At least 74 lives were snuffed out when a blaze ignited reportedly by a cooking gas cylinder blast swept through a passenger train which was en route to Rawalpindi from Karachi on Thursday.
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in their message to President Alvi added, “Our thoughts and prayers are with all the people and families affected by this heart-breaking disaster.”



During their visit, William and Kate had spent five days in Islamabad, Lahore and Chitral.
In her first-ever television news interview about her visit, Kate had termed the royal visit to Pakistan, with Prince William, as “really special”.
