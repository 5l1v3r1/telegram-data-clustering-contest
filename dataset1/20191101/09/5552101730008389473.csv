01 Nov 2019, 09:23 by 黃雅琪
香港民眾昨（31日）萬聖節晚上再次走上街頭，市民「扮鬼」從維園遊行至蘭桂坊，以抗議《禁蒙面法》，另外適逢831太子站事件2個月，大批市民在太子站外聚集；警方在多處使用催淚彈驅散人群，不過在過程中一名社工遭警察打破頭，當場血濺一地，還有一名男子才問「警戒線在哪？」就被警方直接朝臉部噴灑胡椒噴霧。
綜合香港媒體報導，香港昨晚街頭維園、太子站、中環等地都聚集人潮，在太子站外參與悼念的人群一度占領馬路，警方在多次舉旗警告發射催淚彈驅趕人潮；警方依《禁蒙面法》要求民眾立刻脫下面罩，現場有市民透告大聲公向警方表示，面罩是在催淚彈下保護自己的裝備，希望警方勿斷章取義，另外以現場不少居民與長者，呼籲警方別「大開殺戒」。



晚間10時左右，警方與社工陳虹秀發生口角，警方斥責陳虹秀放走示威者，近10名鎮暴警察突然衝上前，毆打在場的市民及社工，1名社工因此頭破血流。接著警方再多次使用胡椒噴霧，有市民不適倒地，陳虹秀批評警方行動毫無理由，要求交待，反遭胡椒噴霧噴射。
受傷社工事後受訪稱，他和陳虹秀晚間到場勸警不要開槍，以及注意周遭長者安全，當時他見一名長者在警察推進中被員警抓住，於是上前了解卻直接被一名員警從背後擊打頭部，之後有員警前來了解他的傷勢，他表明身分後，員警稱當時拘捕的目標不是他，而是要拘捕另一個人。不過他感嘆，社工無犯法卻遭到襲擊，「今次受傷的不只是他，亦是社工的尊嚴。」



南華早報記者Chris Lau在推特po一則影片，一名男子上前詢問警察「警戒線在哪」，沒想到警察便直接拿起手中的胡椒噴霧器，往該名男子臉部噴灑，他立即不適地摀住眼睛往旁邊移動，警察才將拿著噴霧器的手放下，驚人的畫面已超過30.9萬人觀看過，不少港人怒批「黑警」。
此外，港警除了多次使用胡椒噴霧，清場過程中還發射催淚彈、橡膠子彈及海綿彈，據悉，最後約有10名示威者遭警逮捕，包含一名政務司長辦公室助理文書主任被依涉嫌在旺角區參與非法集會為由給逮捕。

01 Nov 2019, 09:23 by Huang Yaqi
The Hong Kong people took to the streets again on Halloween night (31st). The public ""gave ghosts"" marched from Victoria Park to Lan Kwai Fong to protest against the ""Forbidden Mask Method"". In addition, it coincided with the 831 Prince Edward incident for two months. Gathered outside the Prince's Station; the police used tear gas to disperse the crowd in various places. However, in the process, a social worker was broken by the police. On the spot, a man was asked to ask, ""Where is the warning line?"" Spray a pepper spray on your face.
According to a comprehensive Hong Kong media report, Hong Kong last night gathered in the Victoria Park, Princes Station, Central and other places. The crowds who participated in the mourning outside the Prince’s Station once occupied the road. The police repeatedly raised the flag to launch a tear gas bomb to drive the crowd. The Masked Law requires the public to take off the cover immediately. Some members of the public told the police loudly that the mask was under the tear gas to protect their equipment. I hope that the police will not take it out of context, and that many residents and elders on the scene will appeal to the police. ""Open the killing.""



At around 10 o'clock in the evening, the police and social worker Chen Hongxiu had a squabble. The police rebuked Chen Hongxiu for letting go of the demonstrators. Nearly 10 riot police officers rushed to the front and beat the citizens and social workers present. One social worker broke his blood. Then the police used the pepper spray several times. Some people were uncomfortable. Chen Hongxiu criticized the police for no reason. He asked for confession and was sprayed with pepper spray.
The injured social worker was interviewed afterwards and said that he and Chen Hongxiu were present at night to persuade the police not to shoot, and to pay attention to the safety of the elderly around them. At that time, he saw an elderly person being caught by the police during the police advancement, so he went directly to understand but was directly The policeman hit the head from behind, and then a police officer came to understand his injury. After he showed his identity, the policeman said that the target of the arrest was not him, but to arrest another person. However, he lamented that the social workers were attacked without breaking the law. ""It is not only him who is injured this time, but also the dignity of social workers.""



South China Morning Post reporter Chris Lau was in a video of Twitter, a man came forward to ask the police ""Where is the cordon?"" I didn't expect the police to pick up the pepper sprayer in his hand and spray it on the man's face. He immediately discomforted. Holding his eyes and moving to the side, the police put down the hand holding the sprayer. The amazing picture has been watched by more than 309,000 people. Many Hong Kong people have angered the ""black police.""
In addition, in addition to the repeated use of pepper spray, the Hong Kong Police also fired tear gas, rubber bullets and sponge bombs during the clearance process. It is reported that about 10 demonstrators were arrested by the police, including an assistant clerical officer of the Office of the Chief Secretary for Administration. Arrested in the Mong Kok District for illegal assembly.
