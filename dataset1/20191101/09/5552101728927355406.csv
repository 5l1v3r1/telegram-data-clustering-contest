由金馬影帝張家輝主演、斥資3億台幣拍攝的《催眠・裁決》11月1日發佈正式預告與首支幕後花絮。張家輝飾演催眠專家，因捲入一樁命案的審判，必須在90分鐘內催眠4位陪審員來影響判決結果，才能救出被綁架的女兒。張家輝運用懷錶、原子筆、燈光、杯子，甚至用微波爐來作為催眠的媒介，搭配魔幻般的特效設計和動作爆破場面，讓網友看了驚呼：「就像融合《出神入化》與《全面啟動》，兩種享受一次滿足。」



劇組請來香港催眠大師林豐展擔任顧問，他說：「片中有很多不同的催眠元素，帶人進入精神放鬆的狀態，意識水平下降而接受心理暗示。」同台對手戲不乏硬底子演員們如鄭則仕、金燕玲等，笑言演完常常分不清自己是在演戲，還是真的被張家輝催眠了。
《催眠．裁決》由香港知名導演爾冬陞監製，黎兆鈞、施柏林、劉永泰共同編劇及執導，曾在2016年與票房與口碑雙贏的話題強片《我不是藥神》，一同獲得香港電影節亞洲電影投資會劇本獎，歷經3年改稿15次終於拍成電影。

張家輝從影生涯首度挑戰演出催眠師，他表示拍攝前並沒有學習催眠，都是現場與催眠專家現學現演，卻讓每個對手演員都感覺被他催眠，彷彿解鎖了張家輝的「催眠天分」，但他笑言：「我不是很敢接觸催眠，怕自己被催眠後會把銀行戶頭給別人，醒來後會忍不住做傻事。」張家輝坦承最大的挑戰是要從催眠陪審團成員的過程中，帶出驚心動魄的緊張氛圍，他說：「在催眠陪審團的同時，還得想辦法營救女兒，計中計的心理戰演起來與動作戲真的完全不同，特別困難。」
故事大綱描述，曾經揚名國際的催眠專家許立生（張家輝飾），是轟動香港的凶殺案陪審團成員之一。審判最後一天，當陪審團準備退庭商議時，許立生突然收到女兒茵茵被綁架的消息。綁匪要求他在90分鐘內催眠至少4個陪審團成員來操控審判結果，否則將殺害他的女兒。為了解救被綁架的女兒，許立生只能答應，並在暗中聯手曾是特種部隊的楊凱（張翰飾）展開分秒必爭的救援行動。將於11月15日在台上映。

With magical special effects design and action blasting scenes, the netizens looked and exclaimed: ""Like the integration of ""God into the Spirit"" and ""Full Start"" Two kinds of enjoyment once satisfied.""



The crew invited Hong Kong hypnosis master Lin Fengzhan to serve as a consultant. He said: ""There are many different hypnotic elements in the film, bringing people into a state of mental relaxation, and the level of consciousness is declining and accepting psychological hints."" The same audience played with hard-line actors. Such as Zheng Zeshi, Jin Yanling, etc., after the laughter is often unable to tell whether he is acting, or is really hypnotized by Zhang Jiahui.
Hypnosis. The ruling was produced by the well-known Hong Kong director Er Dongsheng. Li Zhaoxuan, Shi Bolin and Liu Yongtai co-edited and directed. In 2016, with the box office and word of mouth win-win topic, ""I am not a drug god"", I won the Hong Kong Film Festival Asian Film.
