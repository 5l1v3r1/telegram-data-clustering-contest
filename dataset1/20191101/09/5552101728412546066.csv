宥勝前進南極曝如廁很「蛋疼」　尿袋變不可缺的床伴
01 Nov 2019, 09:43 by 娛樂組, 陳仁萱
經過2年的籌備，以2個月的時間完成台灣第一支南極長征隊，越野滑雪的方式抵達南極點。然而背後的長征各種祕辛，像是隊員都被食物所打敗等，全被紀錄片導演楊力洲所拍下。經過了一年的後製，完成了《前進南極點》，在11月4日晚間10點在Discovery頻道向大眾揭露。
南極長征隊這次的冒險過程中，遇到了天氣惡劣路線更改、糧食補給等各種人為及非人為的問題，這些阻礙讓挑戰的難度超出大家預期。擁有多次極地挑戰經驗的教練陳彥博提到：「在險峻的環境中，思鄉的情緒是可以讓人崩潰的！」
他回想起長征南極的旅程中印象最深刻的，竟然是來自台灣的家鄉食物，「補給糧食困在智利海關非常多天，隊員們整整1個月都吃不到真正的食物，所以當帶著濃厚台味的肉乾送到面前時，有種重獲救贖的感覺，還有人激動到眼淚都掉下來了！肉乾不僅是蛋白質的補充來源，更是一解相思的最佳好味道！」聽完陳彥博的分享，一旁的南極長征隊大夢青年吳昇儒也激動點頭補充：「在往南極點前進的路上吃的都是太空食物，後來吃到台灣肉乾時，也是激動到不行，感動到忘記一路的艱辛！」
擔任南極長征隊夢想導師的宥勝，招認冒險途中最讓人崩潰的事情，就是上廁所。他提到「方便不方便」，讓人非常崩潰，由於氣候嚴峻、冷風逼人，上廁所時甚至要注意風向，讓起初不在意生活細節的他，直呼：「經歷了人生最蛋疼的時刻！」他更提到在這場南極挑戰中最不可或缺的「床伴」，就是自己幾乎每晚都抱著的「尿袋」！他解釋，因為晚上帳篷外實在太冷，無法出去上廁所，但尿袋就算放在帳棚內也會結冰，所以大家都抱著尿袋睡覺。曾經有一次忘記把尿袋放入睡袋，讓半夜想上廁所的他面對結冰的尿袋不知所措。

整個旅程中最囉嗦的人竟是領隊劉柏園，但也因為他的堅持忍受腰痛，讓大家更有毅力往下走。在一片白雪皚皚的世界裡，可能出現幻覺及恐懼。再加上天氣惡劣臨時改變路線為難度較高的高原路線，對所有人來說都是更艱鉅的挑戰。全隊唯一的女生語萱以不斷為自己加油打氣，靠著錄有親友祝福的音檔讓自己撐下去。擔任極地教練的陳彥博說：「以前比賽都是自己一個人，只要調整好自己就好，這次擔任教練，除了調整自己外也要顧到其他隊員。我要負責當開心果，帶大家從虛幻的心情中抽離，帶大家成功完成目標，把大家平安帶回家。」
「惡劣的天氣、團隊的磨合和器材的保護，都是很大的挑戰。」 負責拍下冒險全程的導演楊力州說：「攝影器材準備非常完整，最擔心的是電池的電力問題，所以準備了很多之外，到極地氣溫很低，電池都貼在身上，是很特別的經驗，也幸好有準備太陽能電池，原本擔心的部分就沒有問題了。」 他也提到說：「團隊彼此扶持、互相鼓勵很重要，那份在每個人心中追求夢想與冒險的熱情也非常重要，這些就是支撐我們完成夢想的最大動力。」
除了在電視節目《前進南極點》公開珍貴的冒險影像紀錄，另外也會在松山文創園區四號倉庫舉辦《去你的南極Go！Go！South Pole》特展，從11月30日至12月8日，展出南極長征隊的專業裝備，還有互動體驗空間。

Yu Sheng’s progress in the Antarctic’s exposure to the toilet is very “egg pain”.
01 Nov 2019, 09:43 by Entertainment Group, Chen Renxuan
After two years of preparation, the first Antarctic Long March team in Taiwan was completed in two months, and the cross-country skiing method arrived at the South Pole. However, all kinds of secrets behind the Long March, such as the fact that the players were defeated by food, were all photographed by the documentary film director Yang Lizhou. After a year of post-production, the ""Advance South Pole"" was completed and was revealed to the public on the Discovery channel at 10:00 on the evening of November 4.
During the adventure of the Antarctic Long March, various man-made and non-human problems such as bad weather changes and food supplies were encountered. These obstacles made the challenge more difficult than expected. Chen Yanbo, a coach with many polar challenges, said: ""In a precarious environment, homesickness can make people collapse!""
He recalled the most impressive journey on the Long March's Antarctic journey. It turned out to be the food from Taiwan's hometown. ""The food supply is trapped in the Chilean customs for many days. The players can't eat real food for a whole month, so when they take When the thick Taiwanese meat is delivered to the front, there is a feeling of redemption, and some people are excited to tears down! The meat is not only a supplemental source of protein, but also the best taste of Acacia!"" After listening to Chen Yanbo’s sharing, the Antarctic Long March team’s big dream youth Wu Shengru also excitedly nodded and added: “On the way to the South Pole, I ate all the space food. Later, when I was eating Taiwanese meat, I was too excited to move. To forget the hardships along the way!""
As the dream instructor of the Antarctic Long March team, the most devastating thing in the adventure is to go to the toilet. He mentioned that ""convenient and inconvenient"" makes people very collapsed. Because of the severe weather and cold winds, he even pays attention to the wind when he goes to the toilet. He said that he didn't care about the details of life at first, he said: ""I experienced the most painful life. Moment!” He also mentioned that the most indispensable “bed companion” in this Antarctic challenge is the “week bag” that he holds almost every night! He explained that because it was too cold outside the tent at night, it was impossible to go out to the toilet, but the urine bag would freeze in the tent, so everyone went to sleep with a urine bag. Once I forgot to put my urine bag into my sleeping bag, and let him go to the toilet in the middle of the night, he was overwhelmed by the frozen urine bag.

The most embarrassing person in the whole journey was actually the leader of Liu Baiyuan, but because of his persistence to endure low back pain, let everyone go more with perseverance. In a snowy world, there may be hallucinations and fears. Coupled with the bad weather, temporarily changing the route to the more difficult plateau route is a more difficult challenge for everyone. The only female language of the whole team is to constantly cheer for themselves, relying on the sound files of friends and relatives to keep themselves. Chen Yanbo, a polar coach, said: ""The previous game was a one-on-one. Just adjust yourself. This time, as a coach, you must take care of other players in addition to adjusting yourself. I am responsible for being a pistachio and taking everyone from the illusory I was separated from my mood and took everyone to successfully complete the goal and bring everyone home safely.""
""Severe weather, team running-in and equipment protection are all big challenges."" Yang Lizhou, the director responsible for taking the whole adventure, said: ""The photographic equipment is very complete, and the most worrying is the battery power problem, so I prepared. A lot of things, the temperature is very low in the polar regions, the battery is attached to the body, it is a very special experience, but fortunately there are solar cells, the original part of the worry is no problem."" He also said: ""The team supports each other, Mutual encouragement is very important. The enthusiasm for pursuing dreams and adventures in everyone's mind is also very important. These are the biggest motivations that support us in fulfilling our dreams.""
In addition to the precious adventure video records on the TV show ""Advance South Pole"", it will also be held in the No. 4 warehouse of Songshan Wenchuang Park. Go to your Antarctic Go! Go! South Pole special exhibition, from November 30th to December 8th, exhibits the professional equipment of the Antarctic Long March team, as well as the interactive experience space.
