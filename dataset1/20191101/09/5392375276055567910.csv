Chinese manufacturing giant, Huawei, has been at loggerheads with the US on multiple issues. The US has always told its allies to desist from Huawei’s 5G. It believes that Huawei’s 5G is not safe and has backdoors. Some weeks ago, reports out of Germany claims that the German government will allow Huawei to participate in its 5G construction. In response to the reports, the US said that if Germany allows Huawei to participate in its 5G network construction, it will reassess its intelligence sharing with Germany. Now, a recent report claims that the German intelligence agency (BND) expresses concerns over Huawei’s 5G.



According to BND, there should be a clear political assessment of the possible risks for the development of 5G. German intelligence agency (BND) accuses Huawei of having direct contact with the Chinese government. It even believes that the company may have a state ownership status. Therefore, one could not trust Huawei. This recent development is putting a dent on Huawei’s hopes in Germany. However, the Chinese manufacturer was quick to defend itself
Huawei’s defense
Contrary to what the BND President claims, Huawei Technologies is not a state-owned company, but a purely private, wholly-owned company. Huawei Technologies is neither dependent on the Chinese Communist Party nor on the Chinese security apparatus. There is no factual evidence for these allegations and we strongly reject them.For more than 30 years, our technology has connected more than three billion people around the world. This covers more than 170 countries. We have an excellent safety record, also and especially in the provision of 4G technology. As a member of several global 5G standardization organizations, Huawei has been deeply involved in 5G network security issues from the beginning, ensuring that cybersecurity is integrated into its technology development and delivery.The path proposed by the Federal Government, which sets higher and uniform safety standards for all providers, is the right one in our view. Using advanced statements and process-oriented testing, all technology providers are equally invited to participate fairly in the competition for the provision of 5G technology if they meet the security requirements. This fact-based and standards-based approach is of exemplary importance for addressing global cyber security challenges. Of course, software updates can and will also be subject to constant audits by network operators, auditors, and IT security authorities, and will not constitute uncontrollable cyber security risk gateways.
