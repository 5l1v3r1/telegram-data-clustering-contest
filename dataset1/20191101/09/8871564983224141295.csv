Police hunt 4 grinning men seen carrying unconscious woman into Bangkok condo (Video)
01 Nov 2019, 09:21 by Coconuts Bangkok
One of four men seen in chilling security camera footage carrying an unconscious 18-year-old woman into her Bangkok condominium and possibly raping her was detained by police today. 
The arrest came after Thai police issued warrants for the four young men seen carrying the accuser to her residence in Bangkok’s Din Daeng district and potentially assault her in footage hauntingly familiar to another high-profile, recent case of a woman drugged and abused.

In final hours, Bangkok model left trail of clues (Interactive Timeline)

The incident occurred early Wednesday morning.
The girlfriend of the woman’s brother told police this morning that the woman was drinking with friends at a bar on the night in question before getting on the phone with one of the men that appears in the CCTV footage.
The source, who also remained unidentified, said the man then picked up the alleged victim to go drink some more at another bar near the Victory Monument. She believes the man was hitting on her. 
Just before 3am – as indicated in the CCTV – the men took the accuser to an apartment in Din Daeng. 
Calls to the Din Daeng Police Station did not go through Friday afternoon, and the investigator in charge of the case could not be reached as of publication time.
Disturbing footage from her condo shows two men supporting the woman into the apartment as two more trail behind. All appear to be grinning. The woman, barely conscious, hangs her head low and needs help walking. 



The same woman told police she and the woman’s brother were trying to reach her all night until they went to her apartment at about 4am but were unable to enter her locked room. Through a tiny gap in the door, the woman said she saw a man taking a shirt off – although she could not make out if he was taking the woman’s shirt off or his own, according to multiple media reports.
Panicked, she left to find friends to help but when she got back to the room the four men were gone, and they got the impression someone had tried to hastily cover up evidence of an assault.
The first thing friends and family saw upon entering the room, the woman recounted, was the woman lying on the bed unconscious, foaming from the mouth. Her clothes her messily thrown together; her bra was not clasped and she was not wearing underwear though she had shorts on.
Confident that there had been foul play, the woman called another friend to help get the unconscious woman to the hospital.
She said her boyfriend, the brother, contacted the four men, who maintained their innocence.
The disturbing scene of a woman being dragged by a potential male attacker – four, in this case – comes just weeks after a popular promotional model died under strikingly similar circumstances. Police have arrested seven people in their investigation into the death of Thitim “Bell” Noraphanpiphat, in an investigation that has yet to conclude.

Unsatisfied by answers, family of model ‘Lunlabelle’ demand 2nd autopsy

All four men and their potential victim did not appear as requested at the Din Daeng Police Station and have reportedly become unreachable.
The man detained today was the first, while police continue to search for the other three.
