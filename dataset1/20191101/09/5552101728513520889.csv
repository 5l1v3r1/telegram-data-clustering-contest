小王激吻人妻10萬和解仍往來 「損害配偶權」再判賠20萬

2016年A男抓到張姓小王與其妻在床上激情擁吻，雙方以10萬元和解，2018年7月，A妻擅自離家獨居，A男監控妻子，拍攝到小王三度進入妻子租屋處，停留整夜，A男提告求償，老婆辯稱係同事聚餐而邀張男，並未發生性行為。但法官認為，小王已介入他人婚姻及賠償和解在先，又繼續出現不當親密往來，一直在破壞A男婚姻幸福，判准賠償20萬元。
台中簡易庭指出，A男與妻子於2011年元月結婚，婚後育有2名子女，2016年底夫妻感情生變，A妻以工作忙碌為藉口，早出晚歸，而A男透過友人到處打聽，終於在張姓小王住處，逮到他與妻子在床上擁吻，雙方事後和解，張男寫下和解書賠償10萬元了事。
和解後，兩人感情越來越差，2018年7月，A妻未告知丈夫擅自搬離，獨自在外租屋，這對夫妻實質分居，但A男持續監控妻子，同年8月6日及8月14日、9月20日，他拍到張男進入妻子租住處的畫面，且張男停留整夜，隔天才離去，顯然兩人姦情還持續著，A男向法院訴請侵權行為損害賠償，要求小王賠償他精神慰問金30萬元。
A妻與小王均否認有姦情，A妻辯稱，因為她與同事合租公寓，上述那幾天是同事聚餐，張男才會一起過來吃飯，兩人沒有發生關係。
不過，法官認為，張男已自承介入A妻婚姻生活，自願賠償10萬元和解在先，有和解書為證，又不懂節制，持續徹夜與A妻獨處或在一起，出現親密行為，即使如他們所言，並未發生性關係，但也逾越朋友正常交往分際，已有不正常往來情節，A男主張破壞他的婚姻生活，傷害其配偶權，請求損害賠償有理，審酌雙方財力30萬元太高，賠償20萬元為適當。
