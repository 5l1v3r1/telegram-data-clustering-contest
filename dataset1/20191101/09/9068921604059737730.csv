Apple Watch Competition to Grow as Google Plans Its Own Wearables Following Fitbit Acquisition
01 Nov 2019, 09:48 by Joe Rossignol



Google today announced it plans to release its own ""Made by Google"" wearables following its $2.1 billion acquisition of fitness tracker maker Fitbit. The deal is expected to close in 2020 pending regulatory approvals.
Over the years, Google has made progress with partners in this space with Wear OS and Google Fit, but we see an opportunity to invest even more in Wear OS as well as introduce Made by Google wearable devices into the market. Fitbit has been a true pioneer in the industry and has created engaging products, experiences and a vibrant community of users. By working closely with Fitbit's team of experts, and bringing together the best AI, software and hardware, we can help spur innovation in wearables and build products to benefit even more people around the world.
Fitbit confirmed that it will continue to support both Android and iOS, and that Fitbit health data will not be used for Google ads.
