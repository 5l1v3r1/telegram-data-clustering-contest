PROUD sa achievements ng kanyang nakababatang kapatid na si Sanya Lopez ang Kapuso actor na si Jak Roberto.
Sina Jak (25) at Sanya (23) ay parehong nagsimula sa  now-defunct  late night program ng GMA, ang “Walang Tulugan with the Master Showman” ng yumaong star builder at Master Showman na si German `Kuya Germs’ Moreno. Si Jak ang mas naunang naging miyembro ng “Walang Tulugan….”  at smunod lamang si Sanya sa kanya nang ito’y maispatan ng yumaong TV host.
Si Jak ay masaya ngayon sa kanyang buhay pag-ibig dahil nobya nito ang Kapuso young star na si Barbie Imperial habang loveless pa rin umano hanggang ngayon si Sanya.
Speaking of Sanya, hindi nito ikinakaila na talagang pinaghandaan umano niya nang husto ang kanyang pagiging calendar girl dahil bukod sa regular na pagbisita sa gym ay nag-diet umano siya para ma-achieve ang kanyang katawan ngayon.
Ang magkapatid na Jak at Sanya ay parehong nasa pangangalaga ngayon ng GMA Artists Management.
Sanya’s real name is Shaira Lenn Osuna Roberto.
