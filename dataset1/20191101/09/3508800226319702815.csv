台北市率先訂「外送員自治條例」：沒替司機保險、颱風天還送餐都開罰
01 Nov 2019, 09:08 by Abby Huang


我們想讓你知道的是雙北市共有3萬5000名外送員，台北市開出第一槍，將要求業者與外送員簽定契約後24小時內完成納保，若無做到可處以10萬元以下的罰責。



美食平台外送員日前發生車禍身亡意外，外界關心外送員的勞動權益。台北市政府勞動局今（1）日率先公告「外送平台業者管理自治條例」草案，要求平台業者應替外送員投保意外險、颱風天應停止外送等保護方式，且無論雇傭或承攬皆適用，預計11月底送於市議會審議。
國慶連假知名外送平台foodpanda、Uber Eats接連發生外送員死亡意外，暴露平台業者以承攬關係規避勞保和相關責任險，台北市議員要求市府設立自治條例規範相關權益，台北市長柯文哲日前在市議會允諾成立「外送員權益保護專案小組」，北市勞動局也於今日召開「台北市外送平台業者管理自治條例（草案）」記者會，公告草案內容。


2位外送員之死後，勞動部認定foodpanda、Uber Eats「假承攬真雇傭」將依法開罰


全台11家外送平台，誰屬於「僱傭」？誰沒遵守《勞基法》？


該自治條例共條列15條文，主要內容包括：

強制外送平台業者為外送員投保意外險
颱風天應停止外送
職災發生應通報勞檢機關
相關食安管理
職安教育訓練

業者需替外送員投保意外險，簽約後24小時內「強制納保」
台北市副市長蔡炳坤表示，無論外送平台業者和外送員是承攬或僱傭關係，都適用該條例。在強制為外送員投保意外險方面，包含因意外傷害致失能或死亡之保險不得低於200萬元；意外傷害之醫療險，實支實付者不得低於3萬元，日額支付者不得低於每日1000元。
勞動局局長賴香伶表示，強制納保部分將要求業者與外送員簽定契約後24小時內完成，若無做到，將依《地方制度法》規定處以10萬元以下的罰責。
未投保、職災未通報、颱風天出勤死亡，業者都要受罰
《聯合報》報導，若發生職災事故，平台業者必須在8小時內完成通報，若未完成通報、或未替外送員投保一定額度保險，將可罰5萬到10萬元。另外天然災害如颱風期間未停止外送服務，導致外送員服務過程死亡，則將罰3萬到9萬元。
《中央社》報導，賴香伶表示，6大外送平台在台北市都有設公司或事務所，上網登記為外送員者，雙北市共有3萬5000人，而自治條例不僅讓執法機關有法的依據，也擴大對外送員的保護。
另外食安部分，運送服務應符合食品安全衛生管理規定，經通知限期改善未改善罰3至9萬；交通安全部分將按季公布外送員事故資料。消費者保障部分，要求明確揭示商品價格、服務費等，且要求業者保存相關電磁紀錄，限期未改善者罰3至6萬元。

《中國時報》報導，北市勞動局職業安全衛生科長康水順強調，因礙於「地方自治法規定」，自治條例的罰則最高只能訂在10萬元，條例的目的是為彌補中央「食物外送作業安全指引」的不足，讓不肖業者無法用「承攬」就想撇清關係。勞動局長賴香伶則表示，北市率先訂定自治條例，雖然無法預防業者的不肖行為，但希望能帶動其他縣市一同推進。
《自由時報》報導，對此Uber Eats表示，現在台灣13營運縣市合作外送員，其合作的汽車貨運業者，都有提供外送員雇主補償險，意外身損就會啟動保險機制，日後若再新開營運縣市，合作的貨運業者也會幫外送員加保雇主補償險；foodpanda表示，目前尚未收到相關正式公文，法規也尚未上路，後續收到正式資訊會再做討論。

Taipei City is the first to book the ""Transfer Autonomous Regulations"": no insurance for drivers, typhoon days, and meals
01 Nov 2019, 09:08 by Abby Huang


We want you to know that there are 35,000 deliverers in Shuangbei City. The first shot in Taipei City will require the operator to complete the guarantee within 24 hours after signing the contract with the delivery staff. If not, Penalties of less than 100,000 yuan.



The food delivery station's delivery staff had a car accident in the past, and the outside world was concerned about the labor rights of the delivery staff. The Taipei Municipal Government Labor Bureau took the lead in promulgating the draft of the Regulations on the Administration of the Delivery of Platform Operators on the 1st (1) day, requiring the platform operators to protect the accidental insurance for the delivery staff and stop the delivery of typhoon days, regardless of employment or contract. Both are applicable and are expected to be submitted to the City Council for consideration at the end of November.
On the National Day, even the well-known delivery platforms foodpanda and Uber Eats successively suffered from the death of the delivery personnel. The exposed platform operators used the contracting relationship to evade labor insurance and related liability insurance. The Taipei City Councillors asked the municipal government to establish autonomous regulations to regulate the relevant rights. Taipei Mayor Ke Wenzhe recently The City Council promised to set up a ""Sports Equity Protection Task Force"". The North City Labor Bureau also held a press conference on the ""Taipei City Delivery Platform Management Autonomous Regulations (Draft)"" today to announce the draft contents.


After the death of two deliverymen, the Ministry of Labor determined that foodpanda and Uber Eats will be punished according to law.


11 Taiwanese delivery platforms, who is ""employed""? Who did not comply with the ""Laoji Law""?


The autonomous regulations have a total of 15 articles, the main contents of which include:

Forced delivery platform operators to insure accident insurance for the delivery staff
Typhoon days should stop sending
The occupational disaster should be notified to the labor inspection agency
Related food safety management
Vocational education training

The operator needs to take out accident insurance for the delivery staff, and ""compulsory insurance"" within 24 hours after signing the contract.
Cai Bingkun, deputy mayor of Taipei, said that the regulations apply regardless of whether the delivery platform and the delivery staff are contracting or hiring relationships. In the case of forcing the accidental insurance for the delivery personnel, the insurance including the disability or death due to accidental injury shall not be less than 2 million yuan; the medical insurance for accidental injury shall not be less than 30,000 yuan for the actual payment, and the daily payment shall be made. It must not be less than 1,000 yuan per day.
The Director of the Labor Bureau, Lai Xiangxi, said that the compulsory insurance component will require the operator to complete the contract within 24 hours after signing the contract with the delivery staff. If it is not done, it will impose a penalty of less than 100,000 yuan in accordance with the Local System Law.
Uninsured, unreported after the disaster, dying in the typhoon, the operator will be punished
The United Daily News reported that in the event of a disaster, the platform operator must complete the notification within 8 hours. If the notification is not completed, or if the insurance is not insured for a certain amount of insurance, it will be fined 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. In addition, natural disasters such as typhoon did not stop the delivery of services during the typhoon, resulting in the death of the delivery service, will be fined 30,000 to 90,000 yuan.
According to ""Central News Agency"", Lai Xiangxi said that the six major delivery platforms have companies or offices in Taipei, and registered as Internet workers. There are 35,000 people in Shuangbei City, and the autonomous regulations not only allow law enforcement agencies to have laws. Based on the same, it also expands the protection of the delivery staff.
In addition, in the food safety section, the transportation service should comply with the food safety and hygiene management regulations. After the notice, the improvement will not be improved by 30,000 to 90,000 yuan; the traffic safety section will announce the delivery personnel accident data on a quarterly basis. The consumer protection section requires a clear disclosure of commodity prices, service fees, etc., and requires the industry to keep relevant electromagnetic records. Those who have not improved within the deadline will be fined 30,000 to 60,000 yuan.

The China Times reported that Kang Shunshun, head of the Occupational Safety and Health Section of the North City Labor Bureau, stressed that due to the ""Regulations of the Local Autonomy Law,"" the penalty for the autonomous regulations can only be set at a maximum of 100,000 yuan. The purpose of the Ordinance is to make up for the central food. The shortcomings of the Safety Guidelines for Sending Jobs make it impossible for unscrupulous people to use the ""contract"" to clear up the relationship. Labor Secretary Lai Xiangxi said that the North City took the lead in setting autonomous regulations, although it could not prevent the unscrupulous behavior of the industry, but hoped to promote other counties and cities to promote together.
""Free Times"" reported that Uber Eats said that now Taiwan's 13 operating county and city cooperative delivery staff, its co-operating car freight operators, have provided expatriate employer compensation insurance, accidental damage will start the insurance mechanism, in the future If the county or city is newly opened, the cooperative freight forwarders will also help the delivery staff to protect the employer's compensation insurance; foodpanda said that the relevant official documents have not yet been received, and the regulations have not yet been put on the road, and subsequent formal information will be discussed.
Extended reading:


The delivery staff has to do more than just send food, and the car accident has to face the ""mystery"" insurance regulations.


The ""employment system"" has labor and health insurance, and the pension is also applicable to the ""Laoji Law"". Why do the foreigners support ""contracting""?
