Salman Khan was scheduled to begin shooting for his cop drama ‘Radhe’ from today and shared a glimpse of the cast from the film's muhurat schedule held in Filmcity Studios today. Disha Patni has joined Salman Khan in this venture, after having romanced the actor in ‘Bharat’, which released earlier this year. ‘Radhe’ will feature Randeep Hooda as the villain and Jackie Shroff has also joined the cast. Directed by Prabhudeva, the film is produced by Sohail Khan and Atul Agnihotri. Salman Khan made the grand announcement on social media.



Ayananka Bose, who is the DOP for the film, had earlier posed a picture of the clapboard. ‘Radhe’ team is planning to start the film’s shoot with a song and a month long schedule is planned at Mumbai’s Mehboob Studios. Salman Khan is planning to wrap one schedule of ‘Radhe’ before he begins with the promotions of ‘Dabangg 3’, which is set to hit the screens in December. The actor is also planning to shoot a song at an exotic international location.



'Radhe' will mark the third collaboration of Salman and Prabhudheva after 'Wanted' and 'Dabangg 3'.
