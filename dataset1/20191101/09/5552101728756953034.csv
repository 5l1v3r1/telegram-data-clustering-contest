01 Nov 2019, 09:16 by 娛樂組
繼2014年的《午夜劇院》，王若琳（Joanna）睽違5年再推全新翻唱專輯《愛的呼喚》。王若琳表示，每次聆聽60至80年代經典情歌，都可強烈感受到歌曲裡女性角色戲劇化的愛恨情緒，於是重新探索鄧麗君、美空雲雀、翁倩玉等歌手的經典作品，集結不同女性角色的專輯概念油然而生。
Joanna說：「當年的詞曲作者賦予歌曲裡的女主角非常強烈而鮮明的個性與情緒，可能是沒有愛不能活、即使當小三也無法離開這段感情，或是止不住心中對愛情的幻想與渴望，很多歌詞從現在來看依然很前衛，我對這些歌曲感到非常著迷！」
Joanna首次在同張專輯中，挑戰中、粵、日三種語言，她表示，「語言對我來說，是表達歌曲裡不同角色的方式，像鄧麗君的日文歌讓我聯想到委婉、淒美的女性，粵語則多了瀟灑和滄桑感。」精通英語的Joanna認為，英文歌較好掌握，唱中文老歌需注意發音，錄製日文歌最難，必須小心謹慎。

專輯名稱《愛的呼喚》（Love Is Calling Me）概念來自翁倩玉的日文歌《魅せられて》（“愛的迷戀”日文版），這首歌詞描述一位無法抑制內心的幻想與想要戀愛的女人，時時刻刻感受到愛的呼喚。Joanna覺得「愛的呼喚Love Is Calling Me」這個名字非常浪漫，也符合專輯渴望愛、呼喚愛的主題，於是決定將專輯取名為《愛的呼喚》。
新專輯於美國波特蘭SinBin的Halfling Studios製作，SinBin是已故Nike全球設計副總裁Sandy Bodecker所創立的藝術村，製作專輯期間，Joanna也在SinBin藝術村住了五個星期，是一個相當特別的體驗。Joanna說，《愛的呼喚》在製作技術上是她參與過最訝異與驚喜的一張專輯，對她來說每一首歌都是一個故事所構成的世界。
而專輯封面是由美國插畫家Brandon Graham所繪製，Joanna穿著太空裝站在一群外星生物之中看著前方，彷彿感受到愛的呼喚。實體CD與黑膠內頁則集結插畫師為MV所繪製的外星生物、有機太空船、怪獸、機器人、分鏡圖等設計圖，有如設定集般呈現《愛的呼喚》追尋愛的科幻宇宙歷程縮影，也為這張新專輯增添獨樹一格的時空感及未來感。《愛的呼喚》將於11/5實體及數位全面發行。

Following the 2014 Midnight Theater, Joanna slammed the new cover album ""The Call of Love"" for five years. Wang Ruolin said that every time I listen to the classic love songs of the 60s and 80s, I can feel the dramatic love and hate of female characters in the songs, so I will re-explore the classic works of singers such as Teresa Teng, the beautiful skylark, Weng Qianyu, and the albums of different female characters. The concept is born.
Joanna said: ""The songwriters of the year gave the heroine in the song a very strong and distinct personality and emotion. It may be that there is no love and can't live, even if Xiaosan can't leave this relationship, or can't stop the fantasy of love in her heart. And eager, a lot of lyrics are still very avant-garde from now on, I am very fascinated by these songs!""
For the first time, Joanna challenged Chinese, Cantonese and Japanese in the same album. She said, ""Language is a way for me to express different roles in the song. For example, Teresa Teng's Japanese song reminds me of euphemistic and beautiful women. Cantonese is more chic and vicissitudes."" Joanna, who is proficient in English, believes that English songs are better mastered. Singing Chinese old songs requires attention to pronunciation. Recording Japanese songs is the most difficult and must be done with caution.

The album's name ""Love Is Calling Me"" comes from Weng Qianyu's Japanese song ""Magic"" (""Love's Fascination"" Japanese version).

Joanna felt that the name ""Love Is Calling Me"" was very romantic, and it also met the theme of the album's desire to love and call for love, so she decided to name the album ""Call of Love.""
The new album was produced at Halfling Studios in SinBin, Portland, USA. SinBin is the art village founded by Sandy Bodecker, the late vice president of global design at Nike. During the production of the album, Joanna also lived in the SinBin Art Village for five weeks, which is quite special. Experience. Joanna said that ""The Call of Love"" is the most amazing and surprising album she has ever produced. For her, each song is a world of stories.
The cover of the album was drawn by American illustrator Brandon Graham, who was standing in a group of alien creatures in space and looking forward, as if he felt the call of love. The physical CD and the vinyl inside page are assembled with the illustrator's design drawings of alien creatures, organic spacecraft, monsters, robots, and sub-mirrors drawn by the MV. The set of ""Call of Love"" is like a set of episodes. The epitome of the process also adds a unique sense of time and space to the new album. ""Call of Love"" will be fully released in 11/5 entities and digital.
