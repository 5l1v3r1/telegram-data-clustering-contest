【星宇K董點子王】離星宇開航日不到3個月　「點子王」張國煒出招成焦點
01 Nov 2019, 09:31 by 徐珍翔, 王均峰
從長榮航空時代，張國煒就被外界稱作「點子王」，不過，二十多年的包袱難免礙事，哪怕想天馬行空一番，往往也高度有限；如今他自立為王，身上再無枷鎖，一連串的「空戰」只會打得更高、更絕，近期一連串的臉書粉絲團操作也教其他老牌航空公司不敢小覷。
距離星宇航空開航日只剩3個月不到，隨著首架A321neo客機抵台，張國煒醞釀兩年多的能量終於爆發，從遠赴德國接機，到回台驗收貨運辦公室、開賣限量悠遊卡，以及邀請粉絲照飛機等等，種種「空戰」策略都讓星宇航空在網路上的話題不斷，勢頭不減，足見當年的點子王寶刀未老。
當年長榮航空加入星空聯盟、啟用金城武為形象代言人，以及大幅更新內裝設備等，都是張國煒任內的主張，看在一些老牌公司的眼中或許多餘，但最後結果總證實他的想法不差。如今，他成立自己的星宇航空，凡事自己說了算，每每出手都能奪下眾人目光。
事實上，星宇航空能獲得一票粉絲的死忠支持，主要還是歸功於張國煒的人格特質。他不拘謹，說起話來甚至像你我身邊的友人，常常口不擇言，但也因為如此，讓人多了幾分親切感；至於他對飛機的著迷程度，也間接說服了眾人──星宇航空必非凡品。
一個人著了魔，常常是吹毛求疵的。曾跟張國煒共事的長榮員工透露，張國煒的行事作風其實一絲不苟，「有一次，在巡視公司時，他看到一幅畫歪了並指出，當下其他同仁都不相信，最後是K董叫人拿尺來量，才發現真的歪了幾毫米。」
對此，去年接受本刊專訪時，張國煒曾解釋：「這就是服務，代表We Care（我們在乎），對客人把視野放大，對自己把標準看細，……」
「未來星宇不管大小飛機、全艙等，我們都會朝著讓客人免費上網的方向努力。……飛機底定後，後續包括座椅、空中廚房、壁紙、天花板、地毯等配置，只要是客人看得到的，我一定親自處理，因為這都會直接影響客人的感受。」他說。
習慣從天上俯視機場的張國煒，對飛機的許多想像也因此被拉得更遠。比方說，星宇航空的英文名是「STARLUX」，其中的LUX是期許星宇航空能超越其他航空公司，至於前面的STAR則有另一段故事：「原先是想採用SKY，但後來考量到，航空業未來可能進展到太空運輸，以STAR取代SKY才能保留發展更寬廣的道路。」

[Xingyu K Dongzizi Wang] Less than 3 months from the start of Xingyu's sailing day ""Zhongzi Wang"" Zhang Guofan out of focus
01 Nov 2019, 09:31 by Xu Zhenxiang, Wang Junfeng
From the era of Evergreen Airlines, Zhang Guofan was called ""the king of ideas"" by the outside world. However, the burden of more than 20 years is inevitable. Even if he wants to spend a lot of time, he is often highly limited. Now he is self-reliant and has no shackles. The ""air battle"" will only play higher and more absolute. Recently, a series of Facebook fan group operations have also taught other established airlines not to be underestimated.
There are only three months left before the start of Xingyu Airlines. With the arrival of the first A321neo airliner, Zhang Guo’s energy for more than two years has finally erupted. From the time of pick-up to Germany, to the return of the cargo inspection office, the sale limit The leisure card, as well as inviting fans to take photos, etc., all kinds of ""air combat"" strategies have made Xingyu Airlines's topic on the Internet constant, and the momentum is not diminished, which shows that Wang Bodao is not old.
When EVA Air joined the Star Alliance, opened Jincheng Wu as the image spokesperson, and greatly updated the interior equipment, etc., it was Zhang Guojun’s position within the office. It may be redundant in the eyes of some established companies, but the final result always confirmed that his ideas were not bad. Nowadays, he set up his own Xingyu Airlines, and he has the final say in his own affairs. Every shot can win everyone's attention.
In fact, Xingyu Airlines can get the support of a fan of fans, mainly thanks to Zhang Guofan's personality traits. He is not arrogant, talking about even friends like you and me, often speaking, but because of this, people are more intimate; as for his fascination with the aircraft, he indirectly persuaded everyone- ─ Xingyu Airlines must be extraordinary.
A person is enchanted, often nitpicking. The Evergreen employee who worked with Zhang Guofan revealed that Zhang Guofan’s acting style is actually meticulous. ""On one occasion, when he visited the company, he saw a painting and pointed out that the other colleagues did not believe it. Finally, K Dong called for someone to take it. After measuring the amount, I found that it was really a few millimeters.""
In response to this interview last year, Zhang Guofan explained: ""This is the service, on behalf of We Care (we care), to enlarge the horizons of the guests, to see the standards themselves, ...""
""Future Stars, regardless of the size of the aircraft, the whole cabin, etc., we will work towards free Internet access. ... After the aircraft is finalized, the following includes seats, air kitchen, wallpaper, ceiling, carpet, etc., as long as the guests I can see it personally, because it will directly affect the feelings of the guests,"" he said.
Zhang Guofan, who is used to overlooking the airport from the sky, has been drawn farther into the imagination of the plane. For example, Xingyu Aviation's English name is ""STARLUX"". The LUX is expected to surpass other airlines. As for the previous STAR, there is another story: ""I originally wanted to use SKY, but later I thought about it. The aviation industry may move to space transportation in the future, and STAR will replace SKY to retain a broader road.""
