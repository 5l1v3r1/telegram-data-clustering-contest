Haas to test new front wing at the United States Grand Prix
01 Nov 2019, 09:33 by Louis Shaw

Guenther Steiner has admitted that Haas have got the design of their front wing wrong this season. The team are trying some changes this weekend at the United States Grand Prix and will hope this improves their performance. 

“It’s not like an update it’s just like testing some variant,” Steiner said to RaceFans. 




“With this new front wing, it was a big change in the regulations,” he said. “As little as it seems, it really was something different the new front wing, and we went the wrong direction.





“The rest of the car, we didn’t get it wrong because I mean we still qualify maybe seven, eight races with two cars in Q3. So we didn’t do that wrong. Now as I said, we found out what we did wrong and therefore I’ve got full confidence we can get back there.”




The team will hope that the front wing change radically improves their performance and that they can end the season with a run of good results.
