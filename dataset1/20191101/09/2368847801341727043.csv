日本琉球王宮殿大火 康熙手書曾懸掛於宮中

01 Nov 2019, 09:31

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】10月31日凌晨，位於日本沖繩的世界文化遺產首裡城琉球王國宮殿的大部分建築遭大火燒燬。琉球曾是清朝屬國，康熙皇帝賜於琉球王的手書「中山世土」，被製成匾額懸掛於琉球王宮殿正殿中的王座之上，目前尚不清楚是否在大火中被損毀。
沖繩那霸市的琉球王國都城遺址首裡城31日凌晨失火，消防人員連夜救火，直到快中午時才控制火場，但琉球王國宮殿的正殿、北殿和南殿都已盡毀。
首裡城是1429年至1879年的琉球王國都城和王宮的所在地，至今已有500多年的歷史，1933年列為日本國寳。
在1945年3月的沖繩戰役中，美國海軍飛機及戰列艦多次轟擊首裡城，3月29日，美國密西西比號戰列艦的炮轟令首裡城盡毀。1992年的首裡城重建恢復原貌，2000年獲聯合國教科文組織列為世界遺產。

如今一把大火，再次將這座王宮燒燬殆盡，目前失火原因尚未公布。琉球大學的教授高良倉吉對日本廣播協會NHK說，大火不僅燒燬了建築物，也毀掉了許多無價珍寳，比如琉球王國曾使用的工具。他說：「我無法接受這個現實。」
「作為負責管理文化遺產的前任大臣，我無言以對，」日本前文部科學大臣柴山昌彥在推特上寫道，「巴黎聖母院大火後，我們剛剛開始審視文化資產的火災對策。」
歷史上，琉球王國最初分為北山、南山、中山三國，明朝年間中山一統三國建立琉球，明永樂帝賜中山王尚姓，成為明朝屬國，清代明後又成為清朝屬國。因此康熙稱之為「中山」。
康熙皇帝手書的「中山世土」原本一直懸掛於首裡城琉球王王宮正殿中的王座之上，雍正手書「輯瑞球陽」匾額與乾隆手書「永祚瀛壖」匾額也懸掛於正殿中。

據康熙起居注記載，康熙二十一年即1682年，琉球新王繼位，按照慣例需要宗主國清朝履行冊封手續才算合法，因而上奏康熙帝要求冊封。康熙帝感念琉球作為屬國的忠誠，在派遣使者前往琉球冊封的同時，手書「中山世土」賜予琉球。「琉球世為外臣，今奏請嗣爵，故將特遣使冊封。朕書『中山世土』四大字，命使臣賚賜。」
琉球王則將康熙手書製作成匾額，懸掛在琉球王宮正殿王座上，以視對康熙帝賞賜的感恩。匾額上還有漢字「康熙御筆」，並蓋有滿漢文的「康熙之寳」印章。
雍正二年（1724年），雍正皇帝又賜予琉球王尚敬御筆匾額「輯瑞球陽」，意為祈禱琉球王國幸福吉祥。
乾隆皇帝在位時曾兩次賜予琉球匾額，一次是乾隆四年（1739年）賜予「永祚瀛濡」，意為祈禱大海彼岸的琉球王國永遠太平，一次是乾隆晚年賜予的「海邦濟美」，意為希望琉球國王將王國發揚光大。
嘉慶四年（1799年），翰林院編修李鼎元擔任冊封副使，與正使嘉慶元年狀元、翰林院修撰趙文楷前往琉球冊封新王時，發現中山世土、輯瑞球陽、永祚瀛濡三塊匾額都懸掛在琉球王宮正殿之中。
「殿上為御書，樓高敞壯麗，巨梯當楹立，正中懸奉聖祖仁皇帝御書中山世土匾額，左奉世宗憲皇帝御書輯瑞球陽匾額，右奉高宗純皇帝御書永祚瀛壖匾額。」
清朝除順治帝外每位帝王都賜予了琉球御筆匾額，1799年，嘉慶在派使冊封琉球新王時，賜予「海表恭番」匾額，道光帝賜「屏翰東南」，咸豐帝賜「同文式化」，同治帝賜「瀛嶠屏藩」。
在琉球王宮正殿中還展出了清朝賜予琉球王的駝鈕銀印，印文為滿漢雙語「琉球國王之印」。新王繼位後，由清朝使者賜予王印後才能稱之為琉球王。
據中國史書記載，琉球王宮展出的王印，應為清朝入住中原後第一位皇帝順治於1654年賜予。目前尚不清楚清朝皇帝賜予的匾額與這枚琉球王印是否在火災中倖存。

The Ryukyu Palace Palace in Japan, the Kangxi handwritten book was hung in the palace.

01 Nov 2019, 09:31

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 01, 2019] In the early morning of October 31, most of the buildings of the World Cultural Heritage Shuri Castle Kingdom Palace in Okinawa, Japan, were destroyed by fire. Ryukyu was once a country of the Qing Dynasty. Emperor Kangxi gave the book ""Zhongshan Shitu"", the handwritten book of the Ryukyu King. It was made to hang on the throne in the main hall of the Ryukyu Palace. It is not clear whether it was damaged in the fire.
Okinawa City’s Ryukyu City’s Ryukyu Kingdom’s capital city, Shuri Castle, caught fire in the early morning of the 31st. Firefighters fired the fire overnight until the noon, but the main hall, the North Hall and the South Hall of the Ryukyu Kingdom Palace were destroyed.
Shuri Castle was the seat of the Ryukyu Kingdom capital and the royal palace from 1429 to 1879. It has a history of more than 500 years and was listed as a national treasure in Japan in 1933.
In the Battle of Okinawa in March 1945, the US Navy aircraft and battleships repeatedly bombarded Shuri Castle. On March 29, the bombardment of the US Mississippi battleship destroyed the Shuri Castle. The reconstruction of Shuri Castle in 1992 was restored to its original form and was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000.

Now that a big fire has burned the palace again, the cause of the fire has not yet been announced. Takahashi Katsuyoshi, a professor at the University of the Ryukyus, told the NHK, that the fire not only burned down buildings, but also ruined many priceless treasures, such as the tools used by the Ryukyu Kingdom. He said: ""I can't accept this reality.""
""As a former minister responsible for managing cultural heritage, I am speechless,"" said Chai Shan, a former Japanese Minister of Education and Culture, on Twitter. ""After the fire at Notre Dame, we have just begun to examine the fire countermeasures for cultural assets.""
In history, the Ryukyu Kingdom was originally divided into Beishan, Nanshan, and Zhongshan. During the Ming Dynasty, the Three Kingdoms of the Three Kingdoms established the Ryukyu Islands, and the Ming Dynasty Emperor of the Ming Dynasty gave the name of Zhongshan Wang Shang, becoming a country of the Ming Dynasty, and became a Qing Dynasty after the Qing Dynasty. Therefore, Kangxi called it ""Zhongshan.""
The ""Zhongshan Shitu"" of Emperor Kangxi’s handbook was originally hoisted on the throne in the main hall of the Shueiwangwang Palace in Shuri City. The 雍 手 「 「 辑 辑 辑 辑 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾 乾In the main hall.

According to Kangxi's living note, Kangxi twenty-one year, in 1682, the new king of Ryukyu succeeded to the throne. According to the usual practice, the Qing Dynasty fulfilled the canonization procedure of the sovereign state, which was considered legal. Emperor Kangxi thought of Ryukyu as a loyalty to the country. At the same time as sending the messenger to the Ryukyu Book, the handwritten book ""Zhongshan Shitu"" was given to Ryukyu. ""The Ryukyu World is a foreign minister. I am going to ask the lord for the present, so I will make a special envoy. The four characters of the book ""Zhongshan Shitu"" are ordered by the court.""
The Ryukyu King made the Kangxi handwritten book into a plaque and hung it on the throne of the main hall of the Ryukyu Palace to see the gratitude of the Emperor Kangxi. There is also the Chinese character ""Kangxi Royal Pen"" on the plaque, and it is stamped with the ""Kangxi Treasure"" seal in Manchu.
In the second year of Yongzheng (1724), Emperor Yongzheng also gave the ball to the king of the ball, Shang Shangjing, and the amount of the pen, ""Ji Rui Qiu Yang"", meaning to pray for the happiness and good fortune of the Ryukyu Kingdom.
During the reign of Emperor Qianlong, he gave the Ryukyu plaque twice. One time was given to ""Yong 祚瀛濡"" in the four years of Emperor Qianlong (1739), meaning that the Ryukyu Kingdom on the other side of the sea would always be peaceful, and once it was the ""Bangbang Jimei"" given by Qianlong in his later years. ""I hope that the Ryukyu King will carry forward the kingdom.""
In the fourth year of Jiaqing (1799), Li Dingyuan, the editor of the Hanlin Academy, served as the deputy ambassador of the canon, and when he was the first champion of Jiaqing and the editor of Zhao Linyi of the Hanlin Academy, he went to the new book of the Ryukyu Book, and discovered the earthly earth of the mountains, the ball of the ball, and the eternal The three plaques are hung in the main hall of the Ryukyu Palace.
""The temple is a royal book, the building is open and magnificent, and the giant ladder stands tall. The center of the ancestral emperor's royal family, the book of the earth, is in the middle of the sacred ancestral dynasty. Forever.""
In the Qing Dynasty, every emperor of the Shunzhi emperor gave the Ryukyu royal plaque. In 1799, when Jia Qing sent a new book to the Ryukyu New King, he gave the sacred tribute to the ""Haiban Gongfan"". With the same text, ""Tong Ping"" was given by Emperor Tongzhi.
In the main hall of the Ryukyu Palace, the gold-colored camel button that was given to the Ryukyu King by the Qing Dynasty was also displayed. After the new king succeeded to the throne, the Qing Dynasty emissary gave Wang Yin to be called the Ryukyu King.
According to Chinese history books, Wang Yin, exhibited at the Ryukyu Palace, was given in 1654 by the first Emperor Shunzhi after the Qing Dynasty stayed in the Central Plains. It is unclear whether the plaque given by the Qing emperor and the Ryukyu Wangyin survived the fire.
