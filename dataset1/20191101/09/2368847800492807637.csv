英39屍案的背後秘密 中國成偷渡轉運站

01 Nov 2019, 09:16

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】英國埃塞克斯郡貨櫃車慘案，震驚國際。英國警方最初稱，39名死者全為中國人，後來又有消息稱大部分來自越南，目前死者國籍仍在鑑定中。據稱20名死者身上被查出假中國護照，有研究員稱，中國成偷渡客的轉運站且是跨國人口販賣罪案溫床。
英國警方日前在一輛貨櫃車內發現39具屍體，一共31男8女，其中一名為女童。初步調查相信他們匿藏於冷凍貨櫃內在-25℃環境下凍死。
英國警方最初確認死者都是中國公民。但很快有消息稱，大部分來自越南，目前死者確實國籍仍在鑑定中。在此敏感時間，福建福州卻下發通知，限制海外媒體採訪。引發外界質疑。
據英體報導，39人死者路線不同，分別經法國、德國、俄羅斯或東歐等輾轉到比利時，有死者是由越南經中國前往歐洲，再輾轉登上從比利時海運往英國的冷藏貨櫃。

英國《每日郵報》稱，慘案幕後主腦可能是來自中國福建、有「蛇頭之母」之稱的「萍姐」鄭翠萍，出生於福州市亭江鎮。1981年移民美國紐約，暗中組織人蛇集團，協助中國人偷渡至世界各地牟利。
她2000年在香港被捕，其後引渡至美國受審，2006年被紐約法院判監35年，2014年死於獄中，「萍姐」死後其集團依舊運作。

中國成跨國人口販賣罪案溫床

據報，越南警方目前已鎖定當地一個偷渡集團的頭目，認定一名張姓男子是這起慘案的幕後策劃者。有越南死者家屬對英媒稱，其家人前往歐洲前曾先到中國短暫逗留數天。
英媒報導，有20名死者身上持有偽造中國護照，令人質疑是否曾有中國蛇頭牽涉其中。
國際特赦組織中國研究員潘嘉偉對《蘋果日報》说，中共政府在本慘劇發生後，第一時間質問英國政府「為什麼沒有保護中國人」，但中國多年來在禁止跨國販賣人口工作透明度非常不足。
他說，就這次慘劇來說，中共應立即調查是否有中國公民參與偽造護照。根據中共《刑法》，以勞務輸出等名義騙取護照、簽證，為組織他人偷越國（邊）境者，僅處3年以下監禁，情節嚴重者判10年以內，刑罰較輕很難起阻嚇作用。
潘嘉偉質疑，是否有不法的中共公安，配合人口販賣，從中獲利呢？與越南相鄰的廣西玉林市已經多名公安高官涉黑被查處。

中國偷渡客只公開冰山一角

英國國家打擊犯罪調查局（National Crime Agency）的數據顯示，越南和中國分別位列2018年來自外國「現代奴隸」（偷渡客）來源國的第2和第3位，人數分別為702人和451人，僅次於首位阿爾巴尼亞947人。
而這些數字可能只是偷渡客數量的冰山一角。2018年在英國涉及現代奴隸和人口販運的罪犯，越南籍和中國籍分佔第4和第5位。

福建村民：當地人偷渡成風

福建是中國最多人偷渡出國的省份，閩南泉州市下轄的晉江、石獅，70年代是偷渡重災區，到80年代中期重災區移至福州地區，90年代末達頂峯。
10月29日，福州村民向新唐人透露，直到現在當地人仍偷渡成風，因為在中國沒有生存空間，很多人不得已才偷渡到國外謀生。
福州市羅源縣村民陳女士說，她們附近幾個村的土地都被當地政府強行徵收，村民沒有獲得賠償，維權都被打壓，跟鄰縣長樂一樣，很多人離鄉背井偷渡到國外謀生。
陳女士說，有門路的話，她也想偷渡到國外，沒錢地又被政府佔了，沒有辦法生存了，她丈夫去上訪被政府抓進去，到現在沒有放出來。
福州簽證代辦業者透露，福建偷渡成風，尤其是福州周圍的三個縣：長樂、連江、福清，導致福建人出國簽證很難辦成，只好高價尋求其他管道出國，而通常到歐美國家打工，三年就能回本。
他還表示，大陸敏感地區的人或被限制出境的敏感人物，以正常管道是出不了國的，不得已才採取偷渡的方式，花大錢又沒有保障。
福州簽證代辦陳先生說，不僅福建偷渡到海外，像東三省、新疆、西藏，都有一些黑仲介、黑勞務公司，他們有這種渠道，花幾十萬，然後冒生命危險，偷渡出去。

福建人偷渡曾發生多起轟動世界的悲劇。
1993年，釀10名福建人蛇死亡的美國「金色冒險號」事件。
1999年裝載599名中國難民的6艘船，停靠在加國西海岸，震驚了加拿大。作家盛雪說，一個小陳告訴她，船上有一個婦女30多歲，因為感冒咳嗽發燒，被船上負責偷渡的人丟到海里了，當時她的兒子還在船上。
2000年英國多佛港一輛貨車集裝箱上發現58具中國人的屍體，僅兩人倖存，這60人都來自福建。
2004年，23名福建黑工在英格蘭蘭開夏郡拾貝時遇溺身亡等。
盛雪說，這麼多年以來，中國人寧願冒生命危險逃離中國，根本原因是中共的專制制度。為什麼美國人沒有偷渡？日本人沒有偷渡？因為中共治下限制了所有人的自由的權利，人的尊嚴的權利，人的基本的生存的權利。

The secret behind the English 39 corpse

01 Nov 2019, 09:16

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 01, 2019] The British Essex container truck tragedy shocked the international. The British police initially claimed that the 39 deceased were all Chinese, and later news that most of them were from Vietnam, and the nationality of the deceased is still being identified. It is said that 20 deceased persons were found to have fake Chinese passports. Some researchers said that China’s transit station for illegal immigrants is a hotbed of crimes for transnational human trafficking.
The British police recently found 39 bodies in a container truck, a total of 31 men and 8 women, one of whom was a girl. Initial investigations believed that they were frozen in a frozen container and frozen at -25 °C.
The British police initially confirmed that the deceased were Chinese citizens. But it is soon reported that most of them are from Vietnam, and the current nationality of the deceased is still being identified. At this sensitive time, Fuzhou, Fujian Province issued a notice to restrict interviews with overseas media. Raised the outside world.
According to British reports, 39 people have different routes, and they have been transferred to Belgium via France, Germany, Russia or Eastern Europe. The deceased went from Vietnam to Europe via China, and then boarded the refrigerated containers from Belgium to the UK.

The British ""Daily Mail"" said that the main brain behind the tragedy may be Zheng Cuiping, a ""Ping Jie"" from Fujian, China, who is known as the ""mother of the snakehead"". He was born in Tingjiang Town, Fuzhou City. Immigrated to New York in 1981, secretly organized the Snake Group to help Chinese people sneak into the world to profit.
She was arrested in Hong Kong in 2000 and then extradited to the United States for trial. In 2006, she was sentenced to 35 years in New York courts. She died in prison in 2014. After her death, her group still operates.

China becomes a hotbed of transnational human trafficking crimes

According to reports, the Vietnamese police have now locked in the head of a local smuggling group and found a man surnamed Zhang to be the mastermind behind the tragedy. The families of the deceased in Vietnam told the British media that their family had recently stayed in China for a few days before heading to Europe.
British media reported that 20 deceased persons possessed forged Chinese passports, raising questions about whether there were Chinese snake heads involved.
Pantheon, a Chinese researcher at Amnesty International, told Apple Daily that after the tragedy, the Chinese government questioned the British government ""why did not protect the Chinese."" However, China’s transparency in prohibiting cross-border trafficking has been insufficient for many years.
He said that in the case of this tragedy, the CCP should immediately investigate whether Chinese citizens are involved in the forgery of passports. According to the ""Criminal Law"" of the Chinese Communist Party, fraudulently obtaining passports and visas in the name of labor export, etc., for those who organize others to steal the country (side), they are only imprisoned for up to three years. If the circumstances are serious, they will be sentenced within 10 years. Scared.
Pan Jiawei questioned whether there is an illegal CCP public security that cooperates with human trafficking and profits from it. A number of public security officials in the Yulin City of Guangxi, which is adjacent to Vietnam, have been investigated and dealt with.

Chinese smugglers only open the tip of the iceberg

According to data from the National Crime Agency, Vietnam and China are ranked 2nd and 3rd respectively from the source countries of foreign “modern slaves” (smugglers) in 2018, with 702 people and 451 respectively. People, second only to the first 947 Albania.
And these numbers may be just the tip of the iceberg. In the United Kingdom, criminals involved in modern slavery and human trafficking in the United Kingdom in 2018, the Vietnamese and Chinese nationality occupied the 4th and 5th.

Fujian villagers: locals sneak into the wind

Fujian is the most smuggled province in China. Jinjiang and Shishi, under the jurisdiction of Quanzhou City in southern Anhui Province, were the hardest hit areas in the 1970s. They moved to the Fuzhou area in the mid-1980s and reached the peak in the late 1990s.
On October 29, Fuzhou villagers revealed to the New Tang Dynasty that until now the locals still sneak into the wind, because there is no living space in China, many people have to sneak into the country to earn a living.
Ms. Chen, a villager from Luoyuan County, Fuzhou City, said that the land in several villages nearby was forcibly collected by the local government. The villagers did not receive compensation, and the rights were all suppressed. Like the neighboring county Changle, many people left the country to sneak into the country to make a living.
Ms. Chen said that if she had a way, she would also like to sneak into the country. If she had no money, she would be occupied by the government. There was no way to survive. Her husband went to petition and was arrested by the government. It has not been released yet.
Fuzhou visa agent revealed that Fujian sneaked into the wind, especially the three counties around Fuzhou: Changle, Lianjiang, Fuqing, which made it difficult for Fujian people to go abroad to apply for a visa. They had to seek other channels to go abroad at a high price, and usually went to work in Europe and the United States. It will be able to return to this in three years.
He also said that people in sensitive areas of the mainland or sensitive people who are restricted from leaving the country can not go out of the country with normal channels. They have to resort to smuggling in the long run, and there is no guarantee of spending big money.
Fuzhou visa agent Chen said that not only Fujian sneaked overseas, like the three provinces, Xinjiang, Tibet, there are some black media, black labor companies, they have this channel, spend hundreds of thousands, and then risk their lives, sneak out.

There have been many tragedies in the world of smuggling in Fujian.
In 1993, the ""Golden Adventure"" event of the death of 10 Fujian snakes.
In 1999, six ships carrying 599 Chinese refugees, docked on the west coast of Canada, shocked Canada. Writer Sheng Xue said that a young Chen told her that there was a woman in her 30s who had a cold, cough and fever, and was thrown into the sea by the person on board who was responsible for the smuggling. Her son was still on board.
In 2000, the body of 58 Chinese people was found on a truck container in Dover, England. Only two people survived. These 60 people are from Fujian.
In 2004, 23 Fujian black workers died while they were picking up shellfish in Lancashire, England.
Sheng Xue said that for so many years, the Chinese people would rather risk their lives to flee China. The root cause is the dictatorship of the CCP. Why are Americans not sneaking? Did the Japanese not sneak? Because the CCP ruled down the right to freedom for all, the right to human dignity, and the basic right to human existence.
