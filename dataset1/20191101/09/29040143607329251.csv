Hot off the press this morning is eBay's announcement of its ""Black Friday Drops"" promotion, offering new deals every Friday through early December with popular products like the iPhone 11, Nintendo Switch Lite, coffee machines, and more being discounted in limited quantity.

Shoppers can check eBay every Friday at 12pm ET / 9am PT to grab the drop of the day. Exact prices will be unveiled on the day of each drop with many items being limited in supply. Shipping is free.
