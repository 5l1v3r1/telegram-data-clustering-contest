韓團Monsta X前成員元虎被爆曾經進過少年感化院，還積欠房租等債務不還，金額多達韓幣3,000萬元（約28.5萬元新台幣），昨（10月31日）元虎以親筆信承認出道前曾經做出不成熟的行為，宣布退出Monsta X。
而今韓媒再爆他涉嫌在2013年呼麻，今年9月在機場還被驗毛髮，雖然檢測結果未公布，但Starship娛樂宣布，「本司無法再繼續與元虎合作，自11月1日起解約。」
因為吸食毒品被韓警方拘留的勝利夜店Burning Sun理事趙某，向警方表示他曾在2013年聽到元虎與當時室友鄭多恩在呼麻，而鄭多恩也承認元虎帶了大麻回家一起抽，問他從哪得到的，他說：「這是祕密」。

今年9月Monsta X從澳洲返韓，警方在機場對元虎進行毛髮毒品殘留檢測，Starship娛樂表示公司對此事完全不知情，原先尊重元虎不願意因個人私事影響團體形象退團的決定，經考量後已無法再與他合作，宣布合約在11月1日正式終止。
數數2019年到現在，因為個人不當行為或是涉及不名譽的事件，作出退團決定或被解約的韓團男偶像，除了元虎之外，還有水晶男孩的姜成勛、BIGBANG勝利、FTIsland崔鍾訓、HighLight龍俊亨、JYJ朴有天、iKON的B.I、Super Junior強仁與CNBLUE李宗泫等。

而BIGBANG另一成員T.O.P因涉嫌呼麻被判10個月有期徒刑、2年緩刑與罰鍰，他在今年7月順利退伍，有網友在他IG嗆：「別想復出！」他親自回應：「我也不想」，雖然之後刪除了該留言，但外界認為T.O.P再回到BIGBANG的機率渺茫。

The former member of the Korean group Monsta X was smashed into the juvenile reformatory school, and the debts such as rents were not repaid. The amount was as much as 30 million yuan (about 285,000 yuan). Yesterday (October 31) Yuan Hu was written by himself. The letter admitted to making immature behavior before the debut and announced the withdrawal of Monsta X.
Now the Korean media has exploded and he is suspected of being numb in 2013. He was also tested at the airport in September this year. Although the test results were not announced, Starship Entertainment announced that ""the company can no longer continue to cooperate with Yuanhu since November 1st. Get off the contract.""
Because Zhao, a director of Burning Sun, who was detained by the Korean police and was detained by the Korean police, told the police that he had heard Yuan Hu and Zheng Duen, a roommate at the time, in 2013, and Zheng Duoen admitted that Yuan Hu brought marijuana home. I smoked together and asked where he got it. He said, ""This is a secret.""

In September of this year, Monsta X returned to Australia from Australia. The police conducted a hair drug residue test at Yuanhu at the airport. Starship Entertainment said that the company was completely ignorant of the matter and originally respected Yuanhu’s decision not to be willing to retreat from the group due to personal personal affairs. After consideration, it was no longer possible to cooperate with him and announced that the contract was officially terminated on November 1.
Counting from 2019 to the present, because of personal misconduct or incidents involving disrespect, the Korean group idols who made the withdrawal decision or were dismissed, in addition to Yuanhu, there are Crystal Boys’ Jiang Chengxun, BIGBANG victory, FTIsland Cui Zhongxun, HighLight. Long Junheng, JYJ Park Youtian, iKON BI, Super Junior Qiangren and CNBLUE Li Zongxi.

Another member of BIGBANG was sentenced to 10 months in prison, 2 years probation and fines for alleged numbness. He successfully retired in July this year. Some netizens said in his IG: ""Don't want to come back!"" He personally responded: ""I don't want to."" Although the message was deleted afterwards, the outside world thinks that TOP is back to BIGBANG.


T.O.P has recently updated personal IG frequently, and it is also laughable by netizens. (Review T.O.P IG)
