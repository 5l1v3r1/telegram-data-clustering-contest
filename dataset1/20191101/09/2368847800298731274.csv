同情示威者 香港政務司官員參與集會被捕

01 Nov 2019, 09:54

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】自香港反送中運動以來，屢屢曝出香港警察以及公職人員因同情示威者參與反送中。10月31日晚，多家港媒報導「香港政務司司長辦公室一名男助理文書主任，於當晚在旺角涉嫌參與集會而遭警方拘捕。
10月31日是港警血襲太子站兩個月，同時也是萬聖節。香港網民發起萬聖夜活動，號召在這一天戴著面具從銅鑼灣維多利亞公園起步，一路遊行至中環蘭桂坊。
當晚，港警如臨大敵全面戒備。除了在多區使用胡椒噴劑，清場外，還密集發射催淚彈、橡膠子彈及海綿彈鎮壓示威者。
晚6時許，港鐵太子站外已聚集數百名悼念傷亡者的示威民眾，約一小時後，防暴警察隨即發射首輪催淚彈驅離，整晚下來，港警在太子站與旺角一帶，至少發射5輪催淚彈驅散示威者。
入夜後，抗爭局勢再度升級。晚間10時左右，警方又在中環蘭桂坊一帶密集施放多發催淚彈和噴灑胡椒噴霧，並迅速向四處街道推進，進行清場，但民眾持續未散，依舊在中環與上環一帶聚集，期間警方逮捕數名示威者。

自香港反送中示威運動爆發以來，香港警察以及公職人員因同情示威者，而參與其中。
9月14日，有示威者在香港淘大商場等地區與參加「國歌快閃」活動。期間，一名中年男子因摘掉黑衣人面罩而遭圍毆。據報，被摘掉面罩的年輕黑衣男子是25歲的香港海關關員林熾輝。但林熾輝卻遭香港海關於9月16日停職。
香港反送中持續近5個月，港警暴力不斷升級，多方消息稱，中共武警已混入香港警隊，目前有兩支人馬暴力「執法」。
而台灣智庫諮詢委員董立文接受大紀元採訪時透露，不少港警是同情示威者的，許多警察暴打示威者的關鍵視頻，都是由港警祕密流出的，而且不少港警還會悄悄參加在週末舉行的抗議活動。
日前有港警在網上曝料，一到大規模示威活動，自己和同事就被勒令交出肩章警號並放假，而且發現很多蒙面「同事」在洗手間用普通話交流。這名港警懷疑自己和同事的身分，被混入警隊的中共武警盜用。
還有港警匿名接受訪問，說現在週末的抗議活動，有很多警察悄悄去參加，每週末的抗議人群中都有很多港警。
在反送中運動爆發後不久，「警察隊員佐級協會」主席林志偉曾公開譴責港府，令警方與市民發生對峙，讓警隊做了政府的磨心，呼籲「政治問題應該政治解決」。
隨後，香港網路電台「D100」節目中，有自稱警察家屬的李姓女子說，林志偉的聲明意義等同「求救訊號」。當權者的確想要在警民對峙中鬧出人命。她呼籲，前線港警不要忘記保護市民的初心，更不要變成一具屍體被人踩著上位。
董立文認為，「這位香港警眷說的話，其實就是代表香港警察的立場，以及想講的話，只是港警不方便出面，甚至直指有些長官下的命令是不合理的。」
他認為，種種跡象表明，那些暴打反送中抗議者的多是暗中到香港的中共武警所做出的獨立行動。

Since the outbreak of the demonstration campaign in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong police and public officials have participated in the protesters because they are sympathetic to the demonstrators.
On September 14th, demonstrators participated in the ""International Anthem Flash"" event in areas such as Amoy Shopping Mall in Hong Kong. During the period, a middle-aged man was encircled for removing the black man's mask. According to reports, the young black man who was removed from the mask was Lin Chihui, a 25-year-old Hong Kong Customs officer. However, Lin Chihui was suspended from the Hong Kong Sea on September 16.
In the past five months of Hong Kong's counter-delivery, the violence of the Hong Kong police has escalated. According to various sources, the Chinese armed police have been mixed into the Hong Kong Police Force. At present, there are two people who are violently ""enforced"".
In an interview with the Epoch Times, Taiwan’s think tank advisory board member Dong Liwen revealed that many Hong Kong police officers are sympathetic to the demonstrators. The key videos of many police officers who beat the demonstrators were secretly flowed out by the Hong Kong police, and many Hong Kong police officers will quietly participate in the weekend. Protests.
A few days ago, the Hong Kong Police revealed on the Internet that upon the large-scale demonstrations, they and their colleagues were ordered to hand over the badges and holiday, and found that many masked ""colleagues"" communicated in the toilet in Mandarin. The Hong Kong Police suspected that the identity of himself and his colleagues had been misappropriated by the CCP's armed police.
The Hong Kong police also anonymously accepted the visit, saying that there are many police officers quietly going to participate in the weekend's protests. There are many Hong Kong police officers in the protest crowd every weekend.
Shortly after the outbreak of the anti-delivery campaign, the Chairman of the ""Police Team Association"", Mr Lam Chi-wai, publicly condemned the Hong Kong Government for confrontation with the public. The Police Force made a government ambition and called for ""political issues should be resolved politically.""
Later, on the Hong Kong Internet Radio ""D100"" program, a woman surnamed Li, who claimed to be a police family member, said that Lin Zhiwei’s statement was equivalent to ""salvation signal"". The authorities in power do want to make a life in the confrontation between the police and the people. She appealed to the frontline Hong Kong police not to forget to protect the public's initial heart, and not to become a body to be stepped on.
Dong Liwen believes that ""this Hong Kong vigilant statement is actually a representative of the Hong Kong police, and what I want to say is that the Hong Kong police are not convenient to come forward, and even pointing to the orders of some officers is unreasonable.""
He believes that there are indications that the majority of the protesters who slammed the counter-offers were the independent actions of the Chinese armed police who secretly went to Hong Kong.
