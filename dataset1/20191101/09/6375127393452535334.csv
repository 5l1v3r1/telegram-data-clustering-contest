KAARAWAN naman kahapon, November 1, ng “Ang Pronbinsyano” star-director na si Coco Martin at ang isang maagang bumati through his social medial account ay ang napapabalitang kasintahan niyang si Julia Montes.
Isang taon na ring mahigit na wala sa sirkulasyon si Julia matapos itong huling mapanood sa kanyang huling afternoon TV series sa Kapamilya network, ang “Asintado” na nagtapos sa ere nung October 5, 2018.
May mga lumabas na balita na kesyo nagtungo ito ng Germany to spend more time with her biological dad and his family.  Umugong din ang balita na nagsilang umano ito ng kanyang first baby  last part of March or early April this year na ang itinurong ama ay si Coco.  Up to this writing ay wala pa ring pag-amin na nagmumula kina Julia at Coco hinggil dito.  Nananatili pa ring tahimik ang dalawa hanggang ngayon. But in time, aamin din ang dalawa sa publiko tungkol sa estado ng kanilang relasyon at maging sa napapabalitang anak umano nila.
Samantala, marami na rin ang sabik na muling mapanood si Julia sa isang bagong serye sa telebisyon.
