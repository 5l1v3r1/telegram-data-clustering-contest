打著慈善名義兜售餐券牟利！　1張3萬元讓「黑豹」怒了
01 Nov 2019, 09:18 by 陳立妍
以漫威電影《黑豹》走紅全球的性格男星查德維克博斯曼，在新片《暴走曼哈頓》化身英勇警探，為追捕殺警歹徒，不論飛車、槍戰或近身肉搏樣樣來，查德維克也撂話：「結局保證讓觀眾大吃一驚！」
查德維克透露：「與《黑豹》不同的是，《暴走曼哈頓》有很多懸疑劇情，究竟一個看似簡單的販毒殺警案，背後的陰謀佈局到底是什麼？讓警探不惜封鎖曼哈頓聯外的21座橋，誓言一夜之內緝凶，結局一定會讓觀眾大吃一驚。」
英雄電影讓「黑豹」查德維克博斯曼一夕成名，但成名後也為他帶來許多困擾。近日某基金會以慈善為名，打著查德維克的名號出售單張價值1,000美元（約台幣3萬元）的「慈善餐券」籌募善款，疑似涉嫌詐欺，此舉讓查德維克憤怒不已，在得知業者不肖行為後即刻憤而離席。

電影《暴走曼哈頓》不只由查德維克博斯曼擔任主角，更由《復仇者聯盟：終局之戰》兄弟檔導演安東尼羅素、喬羅素擔綱製片。羅素兄弟日前接受訪問時表示：「在《復仇者聯盟：終局之戰》後我們休息了一段時間，常常想，相較於這些漫威英雄，現實生活中的真英雄又該是怎麼樣的角色，一位正義，但絕不墨守成規的警察，於是《暴走曼哈頓》的拍攝想法就這樣成型，我保證電影中的佈局、飛車與槍戰絕對讓觀眾看到爽。」
《暴走曼哈頓》描述警探安德烈（查德維克博斯曼 飾）的父親從警時因公慘遭殺害，因此他誓言將所有殺警凶手繩之以法。為了偵破一樁8名警察慘遭奪命的駭人搶劫案，他必須在時限內抓到凶手，於是不擇手段展開緝凶行動，封鎖曼哈頓全境21座橋，並關閉所有交通系統。但就在追尋正義的同時，卻也揭開意想不到的黑幕；電影將於11月29日在台上映。

The movie ""Runaway Manhattan"" is not only dominated by Chadwick Bosman, but also by the ""Avengers: The Final Battle"" brothers director Anthony Russell and Joe Russell. Russell Brothers said in a recent interview: ""We have been resting for a while after the ""Avengers: The Final Battle"" and often think about how the real hero in real life should be compared to these heroes. A policeman who is just, but never sticks to the rules, so the idea of ""Runaway Manhattan"" is shaped like this. I guarantee that the layout, speed and gun battle in the movie will definitely make the audience see cool.""
