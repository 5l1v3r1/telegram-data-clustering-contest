01 Nov 2019, 09:15 by 蔡世偉
《綜藝3國智》為了迎接播出3週年所錄製的馬來西亞特別企劃， 11月2日播出時安排「機位升等挑戰賽」，讓主持群透過遊戲爭取為自己機位升等。關主黃豪平打扮成機長並拿著金屬探測儀到處掃描，當掃描到王少偉的下半身時，警示鈴突然響起，大夥露出不懷好意的微笑，讓王少偉面露尷尬大喊：「我下半身有金屬！」卻遭納豆吐槽說：「你那是破銅爛鐵啦。」
這次闖關採集點賽制，成功者就能獲得一張集點貼紙，假若有人挑戰失敗，後面棒次便不得挑戰，節目將在遊戲尾聲公布商務艙數量，因此蒐集到的貼紙越多越有機會出線。
大夥就怕自己成為老鼠屎，無不繃緊神經拚遊戲，連素有「廢咖」之稱的花花也卯足全力，玩的嘴歪眼斜，讓她緊張直呼：「壓力很大耶！以後可不可以不要再用這種方式了啦！」


素有「廢咖」稱號的花花，為了獲得商務艙機票，卯出全力闖關。

由於大家不知道商務艙名額有多少，王少偉便推測：「該不會只有一個座位吧？上次加薪就是大家平分，這次是要大家疊疊樂坐在一起嗎？」納豆則開玩笑表示：「我應該算是這節目的『大老』，本來就有商務艙可以坐，為什麼我要爭取原本就屬於我的東西呢？」黃豪平聽了笑說：「大老就是要犧牲奉獻，把你的名額提供給大家抽，不然怎麼會有商務艙？」
