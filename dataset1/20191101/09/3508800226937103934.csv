《當我再次是個孩子》導讀：不只是把童年還給孩子，而是把童年還給所有人
01 Nov 2019, 09:09 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是《當我再次是個孩子》非常好看，但前提是，要靜下心，放慢速度，放下「這邊發生什麼事」、「作者說這要幹嘛」及「他有完沒完啊我沒那麼多時間」的成見，像是聆聽一個孩子般聆聽這本書，因為它確實是一個孩子的內心獨白。



文：林蔚昀（本書譯者）

當我們再次是個孩子，才能想起，孩子有受尊重的權利

波蘭兒童人權之父雅努什．柯札克的《孩子有受尊重的權利》和《當我再次是個孩子》是令人讀起來很有既視感的書。讀一讀可能會想起生活的片段，或是在生活中，偶然想起書中的字句。但這種感覺並不像找到失散多年的好友般令人雀躍，而是像遇見童年的自己哀怨地看著你，彷彿在說：「你怎麼變成壞掉的大人了？」
有一次，我帶兩個小孩去公園玩，就遇見了那樣哀怨的眼神。那是新開幕的公園，而且是兒童參與設計的，我興奮地帶小孩去體驗。公園果然沒有令我們失望，哥哥開心地玩了沙坑、飛天溜索、城堡滑梯……弟弟則一直在玩水、玩沙。到要走了，他們依然意猶未盡地想繼續玩。
我叫了他們好幾次，他們不想走。我熱得要命也累得要命，於是強迫把弟弟拉去洗手，抱上車，又開始叫哥哥：「還剩五分鐘！還剩兩分鐘！」但他不僅沒有開始收拾，反而大玩特玩。我氣得半死，大吼：「你再這樣，我下次就不帶你來了！」就在那時（還是回家後、夜深人靜自省時？），我想起柯札克在《當我再次是個孩子》中寫到，一群男孩在下課時間去學校中庭瘋狂打雪仗，聽到上課鐘響了，沒有馬上進教室，反而更瘋狂地玩耍。他們是因為叛逆而這麼做嗎？不是的，而是「鐘聲會讓我們更有力氣玩，就像是行軍時的樂聲。如果在鐘響前，我們還為了保留力氣，有一點點矜持，現在我們則完全放手一搏。我們要把力氣用盡、用到底、把最後一點點碎屑般的能量完全傾倒出來，像是清晨前的最後一支舞」。多麼有詩意的畫面，而且很真實。因為要結束了，因為捨不得，所以要玩好玩滿。這麼簡單的道理，大人卻不明白，也許是沒有餘裕，也許是覺得不重要，也許是遺忘—沒錯，因為長大（或說為了長大），我們忘了許多童年的記憶，忘了我們也曾經因為遊戲被打斷而生氣，忘了不想回家／玩不夠／要和朋友分開的痛苦，忘了大人根本不在乎我們的感受，不尊重我們的意願，只貪圖自己的舒適方便……這一切，都是因為孩子比大人小。
受尊重是孩子的權利，不是大人的施捨
「我們很小的時候就感覺到：大的比小的更重要。〔……〕體積大的人事物總是會引起讚嘆，小的則被視為平凡無奇。小孩身形矮小，人們也認為他們的需求比較小，快樂與悲傷也是小小的。」
或許聽起來有點不可思議，但柯札克的《孩子有受尊重的權利》就是從孩子「不受大人尊重，因為孩子很小」破題的。怎麼可能？怎麼可以？我們不是從小被教導要幫助弱者、尊重與我們不同的人嗎？怎麼會因為孩子小，就不尊重他們？我們不是愛著孩子嗎？
雖然令人不安，但這是事實。身為大人，我們經常幫孩子決定這決定那，決定什麼是對的什麼是不對的。「他這麼小又沒有經驗，怎麼知道自己要穿什麼衣服、吃多少食物？」「他這麼矮，為什麼不自量力去抓公車的吊環？他不知道這樣他會摔倒嗎？我一定要叫他去握扶手。」
當孩子不聽我們的話，「我們可以把他們抱起來、往上丟、不管他們想不想要，就把他們放到這裡或那裡，我們可以用蠻力讓奔跑中的孩子停下來，可以讓他們的努力全是白費。每當孩子不聽話，我總是可以用力量讓他屈服。」我敢打賭，一半以上的父母都這麼做過，甚至有一派教養文會說，當孩子反抗、鬧情緒，你要緊緊抱住他，讓他感受你的愛，然後他就會平靜下來。
許多大人對孩子做的事，如果是對另一個大人做，就會被當成是性騷擾（捏一下他們的臉說好可愛）、暴力行為（打耳光、用力扯著他們的手往前走）、公然羞辱（「你看看你，怎麼什麼都不會呀」、「要用一下你的大腦啊」）、侵犯隱私（把他們從小到大的照片po上網，包括裸露的照片和出糗的照片）。但是對孩子做，好像就沒什麼了，而且還可以用「教養」、「愛」、「不然我要怎麼教」、「也沒那麼嚴重吧」之名正當化。
除了肢體和言語上的暴力，我們還輕視、不信任孩子、討厭他們（沒錯，沒有客套，沒有一愛天下無難事，柯札克就是誠實地指出我們在愛孩子的同時，也討厭他們）。我們常常覺得孩子很煩、很吵。我們三不五時懷疑孩子在說謊，雖然我們不確定他是否有說謊（「你有沒有刷牙？我沒看到你刷喔，聞起來不像有刷過，再去給我刷一次」）。我們對孩子犯的錯容忍度很低，覺得他們都是故意的，對我們自己犯的錯卻容忍度很高，而我們會犯錯都是因為人生實難。
聽起來，我們大人是很殘忍很愚蠢很沒品的生物？這整本《孩子有受尊重的權利》其實是一本「靠北大人」大全？嗯，也不是啦（雖然真的長得很像）。就像善書或教堂會有地獄圖，這本書也以震撼教育的方式在勸大人向善，提醒他們不要誤入歧途，不要虐待兒童還振振有詞。
有趣的是，這本書在靠北大人的同時，也靠北孩子。柯札克並沒有像某些教養專家認為孩子天真無邪，一切都是大人的錯。和一般只帶過一兩個三四個小孩的父母不同，身為小兒科醫生和孤兒院院長，柯札克看過幾百個小孩。這些小孩之中當然有善良、誠實、懂得自制、有道德感的，也有會說謊、騙人、偷東西、欺負人、有心機的。但是我們大人也有這些缺點，也會犯錯，甚至犯罪（程度比小孩嚴重許多，因為我們更有能力）。因為我們壞，就不值得被尊重、被信任、被原諒、被理解嗎？如果我們認為我們值得，那為什麼對孩子是不同的標準？為什麼我們要他們「好」才愛他們、尊重他們？為什麼我們會對孩子說：「你要尊重別人，別人才會尊重你。」但說出這句話的我們，其實根本沒有尊重孩子受尊重的基本權利啊！
沒錯，一如柯札克所說，孩子有受尊重的權利。這權利不是來自大人的施捨，不是討價還價的條件（你要怎樣怎樣，我才給你喔），而是與生俱來。小孩本來就值得尊重，因為他們和我們一樣生活在地球上，如果我們否定他們的權利，等於否定我們自己的權利，畢竟每個大人都曾經是小孩，而每個小孩未來也會成為大人。
我們與童年的距離
小孩與大人是同一個人。話雖如此，大人與童年的距離似乎很遠。我當上媽時，距離我脫離兒童／青少年期（十八歲都還可以看兒科門診，我們就用這當作童年的終點吧）才不過十年，但我覺得嬰兒和兒童真是令人無法理解的生物。我不懂小孩為什麼一看到媽媽不在旁邊就會哭（我明明只是在隔壁房間），不懂小孩為什麼生病的時候特別需要媽媽（我除了給他惜惜也不能做什麼啊），不懂小孩為何明明很累了還要拚命抓著媽媽不放，不懂小孩為何不吃蔬菜、不穿衣服、不蓋被子、看書不開燈、不喜歡洗頭洗臉洗耳朵、老是說那種很好拆穿的謊……
「妳小時候也這樣啊。」聽到我媽這麼說，我才會想起我的童年是什麼樣子。比較有餘裕時，我也會想起，我小時候常盯著床下的滅蚊燈，拚命讓自己醒著，就為了讓我媽繼續陪我。我想起，我小時候也不愛吃蔬菜，也曾在黑暗中K書準備隔天的考試。我覺得我媽媽最愛我的時候，是她某天晚上用被子把我包住，笑著說：「像一個蛹，像一個繭。」……這些碎片般四散各處的回憶，都在我閱讀、翻譯柯札克的《當我再次是個孩子》時，凝聚、匯流起來了。
這匯流起來的東西，是一本童年的流水帳。《當我再次是個孩子》的主人翁是個覺得成人生活很糟，於是向小矮人許願，變回小孩的大人，在故事中他不停東扯西拉、碎念他重返童年的見聞和內心戲。小時候，老師總是和我們說，作文不能流水帳，因為會不好看。《當我再次是個孩子》非常好看，但前提是，要靜下心，放慢速度，放下「這邊發生什麼事」、「作者說這要幹嘛」及「他有完沒完啊我沒那麼多時間」的成見，像是聆聽一個孩子般聆聽這本書，因為它確實是一個孩子的內心獨白。
仔細聽、慢慢聽，會感受到什麼呢？每個人都會感受到不同的東西。我的第一個感受是：好真實，因為這確實是我小時候或我的孩子現在會想、會感覺到的事。就像主角走在路上會停下來看電車和馬車，我的小孩也經常在走路時東張西望，看路旁的告示招牌，問這是什麼那是什麼。對我來說，這些東西一點都不有趣，我擔心他一直亂看會被車撞上，我們會因此趕不上公車。但對孩子來說，一切都新鮮、陌生，都很吸引人。
孩子在街上停下來看東西，可能會被人撞到。或者，他們走著走著會突然改變方向，然後撞到人或被人撞到。不然，他們也可能會奔跑，然後撞上人。在大部分的情況下，不管誰撞到誰，大人通常會叫小孩走路要小心，搞不好還會帶著嫌惡的目光。大人在相撞時多半會和彼此說聲：「不好意思。」但我幾乎沒聽過大人撞到小孩會說：「不好意思。」只要求小孩走路小心，卻不要求大人，不是很奇怪嗎？就像《當我再次是個孩子》的主角問的：「但大人是允許小孩奔跑的。如果小孩可以奔跑，那是誰應該要更小心？是我，一個小男孩，還是有經驗的教育者？」
許多看似平凡無奇的生活守則及道德常規，放到小孩身上，彷彿就像被施了魔法，有了雙重標準。大人告訴小孩要守時，該結束遊戲時就要結束，但去別人家作客時，大人卻說：「再多待一會兒。」（我也常在工作時說：「再讓我看一下電腦。」）大人對小孩說，不可以侮辱人，不可以取笑人。但是當大人侮辱、取笑孩子，孩子生氣，大人反而會叫孩子「不要那麼沒有幽默感」。故事中男孩的阿姨對他媽媽說：「妳的小牛回來了。」男孩生氣地想：「為什麼她叫我們小牛，而不是人？我們做錯了什麼嗎？為什麼阿姨要罵我們是牛？只有母牛會生小牛，她幹嘛要講話這麼難聽啊？」於是沒和阿姨打招呼，媽媽反而生氣，覺得男孩讓她丟臉。
看著看著，第二個感受就浮現了，而且非常強烈。那些童年被遺忘的傷，被大人忽視、羞辱、不在乎、責罵、誤會、不信任、不了解、毆打（這本書裡面有一段文字關於老師體罰對學生造成的創傷，非常傳神）、遺忘的痛苦孤獨，統統都回來了。身為家長，我的痛苦是雙倍的，因為裡面大人對小孩犯的錯，我幾乎每一項都犯過，也幾乎每一項都在小時候經歷過。
因為很真實，很痛苦，所以要慢慢讀。慢慢讀才會讀懂，才能承受痛苦，然後嘗到柯札克埋在痛苦底下的良藥。這良藥其實非常簡單，就只是一個聲音對你說：「嘿，我記得你經歷過的痛苦喔，它們都是真的喔。」光是這樣，就已足夠，光是這樣，就非常療癒，因為這表示，童年是真實存在的，沒有被否定，也不需要被否定。我們不必遺忘童年才能長大，相反的，我們需要記得童年才能長大，才能善待長大後的我們自己，以及我們身邊的孩子。
不只是把童年還給孩子，而是把童年還給所有人
《當我再次是個孩子》中的男孩可說是兒童心理學家愛麗絲．米勒（Alice Miller）筆下的「知情見證者」。這個知情見證者可以幫助大人看見自己的童年，在童年痛苦的真相被揭露時，能帶著保護、尊重、同理心陪伴他，「一起經驗驚懼與憤怒」。看見童年是不容易的，童年的痛苦可能會讓人質疑變成大人、背叛了童年的自己。這自我質疑也非常痛苦，大人可能會因此否定童年的痛苦，說：「沒有啊，我們還不是被打罵過來的，也沒有怎麼樣。」甚至對兒童的感覺及想法懷抱反感，覺得男孩滿口歪理（我讀這本書時，也一直在排斥與被同理之間擺盪）。
或許是料到讀者會有這樣的反應，柯札克也安排了一個「知情見證者」給大人。別忘了，這個故事不是關於一個男孩正在經歷他的童年，而是關於一個大人變回男孩，再次經歷童年。故事進行中，主角忽而是男人，忽而是男孩，他可以同理大人，也可以同理孩子。他對童年生活本來有期待（或說懷念），但後來發現這懷念是虛幻的，童年沒有像他想像、記得的那麼好。孩子也像大人一樣邪惡，不管當小孩或大人，都會遇到混蛋。於是他決定長大。這次的長大和第一次長大不同，是有意識的決定。因為第二次經歷了童年，主角終於明白童年和成人生活的意義。
我們不像主角一樣有小矮人的幫助，但可以透過閱讀，以及對身邊孩子的觀察，用某種類似VR的方式拉近我們和童年的距離。當我們貼近了童年，真正接受了童年的自己和成人的自己，才能成為一個完整的人，也才能尊重、愛自己及他人。

「噓～我沒跟別人說我當過大人，我假裝自己一直是小孩⋯⋯」孩子小小的，人們以為孩子的需求和感覺也小小的、輕輕的。你忘了嗎？小小的、纖細的自己，曾在大人輕率操控的世界受過多少傷痛？教養中的衝突、憤怒與焦慮，是因為遺忘了兒時的哀怨與煩心。戴上童年的VR眼鏡，臥底上課神遊的放空早晨。隨柯札克再次當個孩子，潛入童年的大悲大喜，反思大人與小孩的糾葛關係。

雅努什・柯札克是醫師、作家，也是教育家，他畢生關注兒童人權與教育，被譽為波蘭兒童人權之父，是當代兒童教育先鋒。逾兩百個國家簽署的聯合國《兒童權利公約》即依他的理念制定。本書收錄柯札克的兩部作品《孩子有受尊重的權利》與《當我再次是個孩子》。
《孩子有受尊重的權利》中，柯札克試著向成人說明兒童的感受。他列舉孩子被輕視、不信任、草率對待等處境，剖析孩子脫序行為背後的原因；與此同時，也同理教養者在面對孩童時可能遭遇的挫折、煩躁、反感等負面情緒。藉論述雙方心境差異、兩者間的衝突，他點出，不管是哪種孩子，都應受到與成人同等的尊重，都應以各自的節奏成長前進。
《當我再次是個孩子》則以故事呈現大人與小孩對世界的不同觀點。主角是位父母雙亡的教師。一晚他躺在床上，邊回味童年，邊對成人生活感到厭倦；此時神祕小矮人現身，將他變回小男孩。重當小孩的老師，小心隱藏自己曾是大人的祕密，與普通孩子重新體驗家庭與學校生活。他帶著成年人的經驗和對第一段童年的記憶，默默觀察周遭，細細分析兒童之間、成人與兒童間的種種互動，發現當小孩似乎不像自己所想的，「比當大人好上百倍」⋯⋯
柯札克在這兩部作品中，搬演了兒童與成人的雙重內心戲，提醒大人教養孩子時應有的謙遜、尊重以及將心比心。藉由柯札克的文字反思之餘，我們也看見童年的自己，接近過去曾受的苦痛與傷，終於療癒。
「我們必須往上爬、踮起腳尖、伸出手去觸摸，才能感受到他們的感受，才不會傷害他們。」「沒有專家的協助，我們不知道如何對待孩子，但真正的專家就是孩子本人啊。」

""When I am a child again"" guide: not only returning the child to the child, but returning the child to everyone
01 Nov 2019, 09:09 by Featured Summary


What we want you to know is ""When I am a child again"" is very good-looking, but the premise is to calm down, slow down, let go of ""what is happening here"", ""The author says what to do"" and ""He has The stereotype of ending, I don’t have that much time, like listening to a child, because it is indeed a child’s inner monologue.



Text: Lin Weiwei (translator of this book)

When we are a child again, we can remember that children have the right to be respected.

Janus, the father of Polish children's human rights. Kozak’s ""Children have the right to be respected"" and ""When I am a child again"" are books that are both visually readable. Reading may recall a piece of life, or in life, accidentally remember the words in the book. But this feeling is not as exciting as finding a friend who has been lost for many years, but looking at you like a childhood, as if you are saying, ""How do you become a broken adult?""
Once, when I took two children to the park, I met such a sad look. It was the newly opened park, and it was the children involved in the design. I was excited to bring the children to experience. The park did not disappoint us. My brother played happily in the sand pit, flying strop, castle slide... The younger brother has been playing with water and playing sand. When they are leaving, they still want to continue playing.
I called them several times and they didn't want to go. I was too hot and terribly tired, so I forced my brother to wash my hands, hugged the car, and started to call my brother: ""There are five minutes left! There are two minutes left!"" But he not only did not start to pack, but played a special game. . I was so angry that I was half-dead, and said: ""You are like this again, I will not bring you next time!"" Just then (after returning home, at night, when people are introspective?), I think of Kozak in ""When I am again It is a child who wrote that a group of boys went to the school atrium to play snowballs during class time. When they heard the class bell ringing, they did not enter the classroom immediately, but played more frantically. Are they doing this because of rebellion? No, but ""the bell will make us more powerful, just like the music when marching. If we are in front of the bell, we still have to keep a little bit of restraint, now we are completely let go."" We must use up our strength, use it in the end, and completely pour out the last little crumb-like energy, like the last dance before the morning."" What a poetic picture, and it is very real. Because it is over, because it is reluctant, it is necessary to play full. Such a simple truth, adults do not understand, maybe there is no surplus, maybe it is not important, maybe it is forgotten - yes, because growing up (or to grow up), we forgot the memories of many childhood, forget that we also used The game was interrupted and angry, forgot the pain of not going home / playing enough / to be separated from friends, forgetting that adults do not care about our feelings, do not respect our wishes, only covet their own comfort and convenience... all this, Because children are smaller than adults.
Respect is the child’s right, not the adult’s charity.
""When we were very young, we felt that big is more important than small. [...] People with large size always give rise to admiration, while small ones are regarded as ordinary. Children are short and people are also I think their needs are small, and happiness and sadness are small.""
It may sound a bit unbelievable, but Kozak's ""Children have the right to be respected"" is the problem that children are ""not respected by adults, because children are small"". how is this possible? How could this be? Are we not taught to help the weak and respect people different from us? How can you not respect them because their children are small? Are we not loving children?
Although disturbing, this is true. As adults, we often help children decide this decision and decide what is right and what is wrong. ""He is so small and inexperienced, how do you know what clothes to wear and how much food to eat?"" ""He is so short, why don't he try to grab the rings of the bus? He doesn't know if he will fall? I must call He went to the handrail.""
When the child does not listen to us, ""we can pick them up, throw them up, whether they want it or not, put them here or there, we can use brute force to stop the running children, let them Every effort is in vain. Whenever a child is disobedient, I can always use strength to make him yield."" I bet that more than half of the parents have done this, and even a group of teachers will say that when the child resists and makes trouble You must hug him and let him feel your love, then he will calm down.
What many adults do to their children, if they are doing it to another adult, will be treated as sexual harassment (pick their faces and say cute), violent behavior (slap in the face, and pull their hands forward) Openly humiliated (""You look at you, how can you not do anything"", ""Use your brain""), invasion of privacy (put them from small to large photos, including naked photos and photos ). But it seems that there is nothing to do with the children, and it is also possible to justify the words ""education,"" ""love,"" ""otherwise, how do I teach,"" and ""not so serious.""
In addition to physical and verbal violence, we also despise, distrust, and hate them. (Yes, there is no concession, no love for the world, Kozak is honestly pointing out that we love children and hate them). We often think that children are annoying and very noisy. We suspect that the child is lying, although we are not sure if he has a liar (""Do you have any brushing? I didn't see you brushing it, it doesn't smell like brushing, then I will brush it once again""). Our tolerance for children is very low. We feel that they are all deliberate. They are very tolerant of our own mistakes, and we make mistakes because life is difficult.
Sounds like, our adults are very cruel, stupid and unproductive creatures? This whole book, ""Children have the right to be respected,"" is actually a ""big man"". Well, it’s not (although it really looks a lot). Just like a good book or a church with a map of hell, this book also encourages adults to be good in the way of shocking education, reminding them not to go astray, not to abuse children and plausible words.
Interestingly, this book is also dependent on the North children while relying on the North. Kozak did not think that the child is innocent like some educating experts, and everything is the fault of the grown-up. Unlike parents who usually only have one or two or three children, Kozak has seen hundreds of children as pediatricians and orphanage deans. Of these children, of course, they are kind, honest, self-aware, and moral. They also lie, deceive, steal, bully, and have a chance. But we adults also have these shortcomings, and they make mistakes and even commit crimes (to a much greater degree than children, because we are more capable). Because we are bad, is it worth to be respected, trusted, forgiven, understood? If we think we are worth it, why are different standards for children? Why do we want them to be ""good"" to love them and respect them? Why do we say to children: ""You have to respect others, others will respect you."" But we who say this sentence do not have the basic right to respect the child's respect!
That's right, as Kozak said, children have the right to be respected. This right is not from the charity of the grown-up, not the condition of bargaining (whatever you want, I will give you a jealousy), but it is born with it. Children are worthy of respect because they live on the same earth as us. If we deny their rights, we are denying our own rights. After all, every adult is a child, and every child will become an adult in the future.
Our distance from childhood
The child is the same person as the adult. Having said that, the distance between adults and childhood seems to be very far. When I was a mother, I was away from the children/adolescent period (you can see the pediatric clinic at the age of 18, we use this as the end of childhood) only ten years, but I think that babies and children are really impossible. The creature of understanding. I don't know why children cry when they see their mothers are not there (I obviously only in the next room), I don't know why children need to be sick when they are sick (I can't do anything but give him sympathy), I don't know children. Why is it so tired that I still have to hold my mother hard, I don’t know why children don’t eat vegetables, don’t wear clothes, don’t cover quilts, don’t read books, don’t like to wash their hair, wash their ears, always say that Detach the lie...
""It’s the same when I was young."" I heard my mom say this, I will remember what my childhood was like. When there is more than enough, I will also remember that when I was a child, I often stared at the mosquito lamp under the bed and tried to make myself awake, just to let my mother continue to accompany me. I remembered that I didn't like to eat vegetables when I was young, and I used to prepare for the next day's exam in the dark. I think when my mother loved me the most, she wrapped me in the quilt one night and smiled and said, ""Like a beggar, like a beggar.""... These fragments of memories are scattered throughout me. When I translated Kozak’s ""When I was a Child Again,"" it condensed and merged.
This confluence is a childhood account. The master of ""When I am a child again"" is a person who thinks that adult life is very bad, so he makes a wish to the dwarf and turns back to the child. In the story, he keeps slamming Shiraz and smashing his experience of returning to childhood and inner drama. . When I was young, the teacher always told us that the essay can't flow, because it will not look good. ""When I am a child again"" is very good-looking, but the premise is that you should calm down, slow down, let go of ""what is happening here"", ""The author says this is going to do"" and ""He is not finished, I am not that much."" The prejudice of time is like listening to a book as a child, because it is indeed a child's inner monologue.
Listen carefully, listen slowly, what will you feel? Everyone will feel different things. My first feeling is: It's true, because it's really something I thought and would feel when I was a kid or my child. Just as the protagonist walks on the road, he will stop to see the tram and the carriage. My children often look around when they walk, look at the signs on the roadside and ask what it is. For me, these things are not interesting at all. I am worried that he will always be hit by a car and we will not be able to catch the bus. But for children, everything is fresh and unfamiliar, and it is very attractive.
The child stops on the street to see things and may be hit by people. Or, as they walk, they suddenly change direction and then hit or be hit. Otherwise, they may run and then hit people. In most cases, no matter who hits someone, adults usually ask the child to walk carefully, and if they do, they will have a disgusting look. When adults collide, they will say to each other more and more: ""Sorry."" But I almost never heard that adults hit the children and said, ""Sorry."" It is not very strange to ask the children to walk carefully, but not to ask adults. ? Just like the protagonist of ""When I am a child again,"" I asked: ""But adults allow children to run. If a child can run, who should be more careful? Is it me, a little boy, or an experienced educator? ""
Many seemingly ordinary life codes and ethical routines are placed on children as if they were enchanted and have double standards. When adults tell children to be punctual, they should end when they end the game, but when they go to other people's homes, the adults say, ""Let's stay a little longer."" (I also often said at work: ""Let me see the computer again."" The adults said to the children, you can't insult people, you can't make fun of people. But when an adult insults and makes fun of the child, the child is angry, but the adult will ask the child to ""don't have such a sense of humor."" The boy's aunt said to his mother: ""The calf is back."" The boy said angrily: ""Why did she call us a calf, not a person? What have we done wrong? Why do aunts want us to be cows? Only the cow will have a calf, why should she talk so ugly?"" So she didn't say hello to her, but her mother was angry and felt that the boy made her lose face.
Looking at it, the second feeling came to light, and it was very strong. Those children who have been forgotten in childhood are ignored, humiliated, indifferent, scolded, misunderstood, distrusted, uninformed, beaten (there is a paragraph in this book about the trauma of teachers’ corporal punishment on students, very expressive), the painful loneliness of forgetting All are back. As a parent, my pain is doubled, because the adults who make mistakes about children, I have almost committed every single thing, and almost every one has experienced it in my childhood.
Because it is very real and very painful, so read slowly. Read slowly to read, to endure the pain, and then taste the good medicine that Kozak buried under the pain. This medicine is actually very simple. It is just a voice saying to you, ""Hey, I remember the pain you have experienced. They are all true."" This is enough, just like this, it is very healing. Because this means that childhood is real, not denied, and does not need to be denied. We don't have to forget our childhood to grow up. On the contrary, we need to remember that we can grow up in our childhood to be able to treat ourselves and our children.
Not only returning the child to the child, but returning the child to everyone
The boy in ""When I am a child again"" can be said to be a child psychologist Alice. Alice Miller's ""informed witness"". This informed witness can help adults to see their childhood. When the truth of childhood pain is revealed, they can accompany him with protection, respect, and empathy. ""Experience fear and anger together."" It is not easy to see childhood. The pain of childhood may make people doubt that they become adults and betray their childhood. This self-question is also very painful. Adults may therefore deny the pain of childhood and say, ""No, we are not being beaten, nor how."" Even the children’s feelings and thoughts are resentful and the boy is full of mouth.歪理 (when I read this book, I have always been arguing between being excluded and being treated by the same reason).
Perhaps it is expected that the reader will react like this, and Kozak also arranged an ""informed witness"" for adults. Don't forget, this story is not about a boy who is going through his childhood, but about an adult who turns back to a boy and goes through childhood again. In the middle of the story, the protagonist is a man, but a boy. He can be an adult or a child. He had an expectation (or nostalgia) for his childhood, but later found that this nostalgia was illusory, and his childhood was not as good as he imagined and remembered. Children are also as evil as adults, and whenever they are children or adults, they will meet bastards. So he decided to grow up. It is a conscious decision to grow up this time and grow up for the first time. Because of his second childhood, the protagonist finally understood the meaning of childhood and adult life.
We don't have the help of a dwarf like the protagonist, but we can use our VR-like approach to bring us closer to our childhood through reading and observation of the children around us. When we are close to childhood, we truly accept the childhood ourselves and the adults themselves to become a complete person and to respect and love ourselves and others.

""Hey~ I didn't tell others that I was an adult. I pretended that I have always been a child."" The child is small, and people think that the child's needs and feelings are small and light. Did you forget it? How small is the small, slender self that has suffered in the world that adults are rashly controlled? The conflict, anger and anxiety in parenting are due to the forgetting of childhood sadness and trouble. Put on the VR glasses of childhood, and go to the bottom of the class to go to the morning. With Kozak being a child again, he sneaked into the great joys of childhood and reflected on the entanglement between adults and children.

Janusz Kozak is a physician, writer, and educator. He has been paying attention to children's human rights and education throughout his life. He is known as the father of Polish children's human rights and a pioneer in contemporary children's education. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, signed by more than 200 countries, is based on his philosophy. This book contains two works by Kozak, ""Children have the right to be respected"" and ""When I am a child again.""
In ""The Child Has Respected Rights,"" Kozak tries to explain the child's feelings to adults. He cites the situation in which children are despised, distrusted, and sloppy, and analyzes the reasons behind the child's disordered behavior; at the same time, it also deals with the negative emotions such as setbacks, irritability, and resentment that may be encountered by the educators in the face of children. By discussing the differences between the two sides and the conflict between the two, he points out that no matter what kind of child, they should be treated with the same respect as adults, and they should grow at their own pace.
""When I am a child again,"" the story shows the different views of adults and children on the world. The protagonist is a teacher whose parents are both dead. One night he was lying in bed, reminiscing about his childhood, and tired of adult life; at this time the mysterious dwarf appeared and turned him back to the little boy. A teacher who is a child, carefully hide the secrets of being an adult, and relive the family and school life with ordinary children. He took the experience of adults and the memory of the first childhood, silently observed the surroundings, and analyzed the interactions between children, adults and children, and found that when children do not seem to think, ""beyond adults."" Hundreds of times""
In these two works, Kozak has played the dual inner drama of children and adults, reminding adults of the humility, respect and heart-to-heart when educating their children. With the reflection of Kozak's words, we also saw the childhood of ourselves, approaching the pain and injury that I suffered in the past, and finally healed.
""We have to climb up, pick up our toes, reach out and touch them to feel their feelings, so we won't hurt them."" ""Without the help of experts, we don't know how to treat children, but the real expert is the child."" what.""
