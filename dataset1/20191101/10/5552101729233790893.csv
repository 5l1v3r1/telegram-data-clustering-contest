播出超過20年、堪稱長壽的大型綜藝節目《快樂大本營》，明晚（2日）10點將於中天綜合台播出，由「快樂家族」何炅、謝娜、李維嘉、吳昕、杜海濤等人主持，首播來賓便是至今話題不減的《延禧攻略》主要演員秦嵐、吳謹言、佘詩曼及許凱。
《延禧攻略》播出後，劇中演員隨之爆紅，當中討論度最高的，便是飾演「富察傅恆」的許凱，戲約接不完，從仙俠、將軍演到玩世不恭的富家子，粉絲也非常期待再看見吳謹言與許凱合體，但許凱卻自曝：「『傅瓔CP』的愛情已經過去了，我現在只為『她』吃醋。」
原來許凱主演的《招搖》、《烈火軍校》，都是與大陸女星白鹿組成CP，他說：「《招搖》和白鹿有很多甜蜜戲碼，我入戲太深超愛吃醋。」此話一出，馬上引發「傅瓔粉」與「搖瀾粉」的爭論。
雖然暫時還看不到「傅瓔CP」在新戲中合體，但可在《快樂大本營》中重溫《延禧攻略》後宮佳麗倩影，甚至化不可能為可能，許凱換上了大紅色喜服，高調迎娶吳謹言，讓現場觀眾激動大喊：「『傅瓔CP』一定要永遠幸福。」
劇中飾演富察皇后秦嵐開心的說：「你們終於圓了我的夢啊！」吳謹言更哽咽表示：「好不容易啊，這可是我的夢想。」甜翻眾人！，在《快樂大本營》中圓夢的還有宮女「明玉」的姜梓新，小清新形象擄獲不少粉絲的喜愛，參加經典遊戲「不要說，唱！」一開口唱歌嗓音渾厚，反轉的聲線讓眾人相當驚訝，一夕之間也讓「明玉唱功」成熱搜話題。不只明玉，在《延禧攻略》裡富察皇后溫暖酥軟的聲音早吸粉不少，秦嵐和飾演海蘭察的王冠逸在節目中大唱情歌，更讓人聽得如癡如醉。
