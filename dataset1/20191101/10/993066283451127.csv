Essex police have travelled to Belfast to make a direct appeal to two brothers they wish to speak to in connection with the discovery of 39 bodies in a lorry container on an industrial estate in England last week.
Detective Chief Inspector Daniel Stoten told reporters at a press conference today that police searching for Co Armagh brothers Ronan and Christopher Hughes had already spoken to one of the siblings in a phone call.
Mr Stoten said: ""Today I want to make a direct appeal - Ronan and Christopher, hand yourselves in to the Police Service of Northern Ireland.
""We need you both to come forward and assist this investigation. Although we have already spoken to Ronan Hughes recently by telephone we need to have a conversation with him and his brother in person.
""Talking to Ronan and Christopher is crucial to our investigation and the sooner we can make this happen the sooner we can progress and continue with our investigation.""



Mr Stoten also revealed the PSNI yesterday seized a lorry believed to be connected to the Hughes brothers. 
He said: ""Yesterday, on Thursday 31 October, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, acting upon information, stopped a lorry believed to be connected to the Hughes brothers. The vehicle was subsequently seized and no further arrests were made.""
