甚麼是海外留學生保險？
海外升學保險大多提供全年保障， 部分計劃也提供短期課程計劃。除了一般旅遊保險必備的保障外，留學保險更涵蓋專門為留學生而設的項目，包括個人行李及財物、海外家居財物、學業中斷、監護人意外身亡的教育基金、醫療費、住院津貼等，提供更全面的留學保障。

旅遊保險、意外保或不適合海外留學生
有些人以為，購買全年旅遊保險或已足夠。然而，很多坊間的全年旅遊保險都有列明，每次離港的旅程最長限期為90日，未必適合離港一年的留學生。除旅遊保險，有些家長亦會以為為子女投購意外保險，亦能照顧他們在留學期間的醫療需要；事實上，門診開支一般都不在意外保險的保障範圍。

反之，海外留學生保險便能為留學生提供全面的旅遊保障和醫療保障。海外留學生保險讓留學生在外地讀書期間，假日離開讀書的城市，前往鄰近地區旅遊亦能獲得全面的旅遊保障，因為人在外地，本來就難以購買香港保險公司推出的旅遊保險，香港大部份的旅遊保險均要求投保人如離開香港前投保。留學生只能選擇全球或當地的保險公司所推出的旅遊保險。
實習、兼職工作亦受保
部分的學系或學校的畢業要求會包括實習工作，有些留學生為幫補生活開支亦會做兼職工作。部分留學生保險會保障實習和兼職工作，有些保險計劃則只會保障學校安排並為課程要求的實習工作。此外，大家亦要留意保險條款往往會列出一些不保事項，大家要細閱保險計劃的條款。
獨設教育基金、學業中斷、親友緊急探訪保障
事實上，留學生保險可謂一份為海外升學的留學生度身訂造的保險計劃。除上述保障，海外留學生保險更有教育基金、學業中斷、親友緊急探訪等保障項目，在受保學生不幸遇上突發事情時亦能獲一定保障。
若受保學生的父母或監護人不幸身亡或永久傷殘，留學生保險的「教育基金」保障便能協助學生支付學費。而「學業中斷」則指，若學生因戰亂、受傷、直系親屬死亡，無可奈何需要中斷學習，這項保障便能賠償未使用但無法退回的學費和按金，以減少投保人的損失。若受保學生在留學當地患病或受傷入院，父母需前往當地探望和照顧，留學保險的「親友緊急探訪」保障便會提供交通津貼、住宿津貼和休假津貼。
醫療保障點揀好？留意熱門留學地區指定醫保要求
事實上，外國大部分院校都會根據當地政府政策，為留學生提供醫療保障，或要求學生購買醫療保險。除了美國、加拿大和台灣等國家沒有規定學生需要購買指定醫療保險計劃外，大多國家會要求留學生購買指定醫療保險計劃。大家選購留學保險時，可以選擇不包醫療保障的基本計劃，以免保障重疊，節省開支。
