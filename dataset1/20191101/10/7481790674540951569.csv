足立区の大腸がん検診、陽性の１０７人に「異常なし」通知

01 Nov 2019, 10:36

　東京都足立区は１日、２０１８年度に実施した大腸がん検診で、受診者のうち「陽性」と判定された１０７人に、「異常なし」と伝えるミスがあったと発表した。検診を行った医療機関の一部が受診票に「陰性」と間違って記入したためで、区では受診者に謝罪し、自己負担なしで精密検査を行うとしている。
　発表によると、検診は４０歳以上の区民を対象に２２７の医療機関で実施し、４万６７４７人が受診した。各機関は、受診者の検体を調べた検査会社の判定を受診票に書き入れて受診者に通知したが、このうち陽性を陰性と記入したミスが６０機関計１０７人分見つかった。区が今月、陽性と判定された人に精密検査を促した際にミスが発覚した。
　大腸がん検診は０５年度から実施しており、区は過去の年度でも同様のミスがあった可能性もあるとみて調べる。
