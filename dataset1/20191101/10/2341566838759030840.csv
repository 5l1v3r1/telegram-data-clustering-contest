（中央社記者陳朝福高雄1日電）高雄監獄陳姓收容人日前身體不適昏迷送醫後不治，高雄地檢署與法醫相驗後懷疑遭不當管教，昨天搜索雄監查扣相關證物並傳喚李姓管理員和雜役共6人偵辦，今天聲押6人獲准。
檢警調查，陳姓收容人因家暴案入監，有與收容人口角和不服管理等情事，10多天前再與收容人因故發生衝突，陳姓收容人突然嘔吐昏迷，雄監派人送往國軍高雄總醫院急救不治。
檢方與法醫複驗後懷疑遭不當管教，非純因疾病死亡，全案改分偵字案查辦，昨天指揮警方搜索雄監查扣相關證物，並傳喚戒護科李姓和劉姓管理員及4名雜役。據了解，6人庭訊時仍供詞不一及推卸等情形，檢方訊後認為涉傷害致死嫌疑重大，向法院聲請羈押。
高雄地方法院上午召開羈押庭審理，法官認定6名被告犯嫌重大，供詞避重就輕，之間又有上下管理控制關係，有事實足以認定有串供、湮滅證據之虞，均予羈押禁見，並不得閱報、收看電視。
至於陳姓收容人詳細死因，雄檢表示，待法醫研究所正式鑑驗報告出爐後說明。
對於收容人疑遭不當管教致死，高雄監獄表示，全案已進入司法程序，不便說明，會全力配合檢方偵辦。（編輯：方沛清）1081101
