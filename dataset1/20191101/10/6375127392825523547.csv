SUGATAN ang dalawang traffic enforcer ng South Luzon Skyway maka-raang pagbabarilin ng isang naka-motorsiklong lalaki na kanilang hinahabol kamakalawa ng gabi sa Paranaque City.
Kaagad na isinugod sa Paranaque District Hospital sina Rexie Talingdan, 39 ng Upper Bicutan, Taguig City at Ronnie Delos Santos, 46, ng Unit 07 4778 Rosal St. Marimar Village, 1 Bgy. Sun Valley sanhi ng tama ng bala sa katawan.
Nakatakas naman ang hindi pa nakikilalang suspek na nakasuot ng kulay berdeng jacket at pulang helmet, sakay ng kanyang itim na Honda TMX na may plakang “for registration” palabas ng Bicutan exit.
Sa imbestigasyon ng pulisya, dakong alas-7:45 ng gabi nang mamataan ni Talingdan ang pagtahak sa southbound lane ng Skyway ng suspek sakay ng isang uri ng motorsiklong hindi awtorisadong makapasok ng highway kaya’t hinabol niya ang lalaki, gamit ang kanyang service motorcycle.
Namataan din ni Delos Santos ang paghabol ni Talingdan sa suspek kaya’t tumulong siya sa pag tugis hanggang ma-korner nila ang lalaki sa Km 13, Bgy. Sun Valley makaraang sumadsad sa bangketa.
Nang lalapitan na ng dalawa ang suspek, bigla itong bumunot ng baril at pinaputukan ang mga biktima bago mabilis na sumakay muli sa kanyang motorsiklo at tumakas palabas ng Bicutan Skyway exit.
Nakuha sa lugar na pinangyarihan ng pamamaril ang dalawang piraso ng basyo ng kalibre .9mm na nakatakdang dalhin sa PNP Crime Laboratory para sa ballistic examination.
