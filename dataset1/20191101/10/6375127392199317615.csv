Nadine now 26, becomes more daring
01 Nov 2019, 10:00 by Aster Amoyo
ABS-CBN and Viva star Nadine Lustre turned 26 last October 31.
Kung ang reel and real life boyfriend niyang si James Reid ay naging isa sa tumayong judges ng nagtapos na “Idol Philippines” along with Regine Velasquez, Vice Ganda and Moira de la Torre, si Nadine ay isa naman  sa tatayong hurado ng magsisimulang talent reality show na “Your Moment” ngayong Sabado, November 9 along with King of Talk Boy Abunda, ang singer-dancer-actor and TV host Billy Crawford to be hosted by Luis Manzano and Vhong Navarro.
At 26, Nadine is more mature and  daring as an artist at patunay dito ang kanyang recent sexy pictorials.
Nadine made two solo movies  this year na hindi katambal si James, ang “Ulan” with Carlo Aquino at “Indak” with Sam Concepcion.  This year din niya natanggap ang tatlo niyang Best Actress trophies mula sa Gawad Urian, FAMAS at Young Critics Circle or YCC dahil sa mahusay niyang pagkakaganap sa pelikulang “Never Not Love You” na pinagtambalan nila ni James at dinirek ni Antoinette Jadaone under Viva Films.
Tulad ng kanyang  partner na si James, gusto rin ni Nadine na mag-explore sa iba pang bagay na lalong makakatulong na kanya na ma-enhance ang kanyang sarili  bilang isang artist.
Although nagli-live in na sina James at Nadine, wala umano sa immediate plans nila ang pag-aasawa at pagkakaroon ng anak dahil pareho pa silang may mga pangarap na gustong abutin.
Nagdaos ng birthday si Nadine last October 31 (ka-birthday niya sina Christopher de Leon at Annabelle Rama).

This year he also received three Best Actress trophies from Gawad Urian, FAMAS and Young Critics Circle or YCC for his excellent performance in the ""Never Not Love You"" movie starring James and directed by Antoinette Jadaone under Viva Films.
