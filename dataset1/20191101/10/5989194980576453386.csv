Tech glitch halts trading on Nordic stock exchange
01 Nov 2019, 10:39 by TT/The Local

UPDATED: Nasdaq suspended trading on its Nordic stock markets on Friday morning due to technical problems.

""Nasdaq is experiencing connectivity issues, affecting markets in the Nordics and Baltics. As a result, equity and equity derivatives markets have been halted. We are working diligently to resolve the issue,"" said Nasdaq in a statement.
The problems started at around 11am and affect stock markets in Copenhagen, Helsinki, Iceland, the Baltics and Stockholm. The Oslo stock exchange has another owner and is not affected by the problems.
Nasdaq initially said it was ""working to open the markets with an opening auction"" at 12.50pm, followed by continuous trading from 1pm. The Stockholm exchange was set to close at 1pm on Friday, because it is the day before a public holiday in Sweden. Its opening hours would be extended to 2pm.
But at 1pm trading had to be halted again after the connectivity issues persisted.
The Stockholm exchange will now remain closed for the rest of the day, said Nasdaq.
Before the problems emerged, the OMXS index had risen 0.3 percent, in line with European markets.
Among the big winners were Hexagon (up 1.6 percent) and SCA (up 1.4 percent).
Tobacco company Swedish Match was down 1.6 percent.
