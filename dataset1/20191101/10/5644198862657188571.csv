Mr Mohan took top prize in the Story of the Year category for his captivating account of footballer Lionel Tan's decision to interrupt his National Service stint to fight for a spot on the Under-22 national side going to the 2019 SEA Games.In the story, Mr Mohan wrote of how Mr Tan juggled his National Service demands as he passionately pursued his dream of winning a place in the Under-22 squad going to the Philippines, after missing out on playing action at the 2017 Sea Games in Malaysia.

""I felt that Lionel’s story was one worth telling. Representing the nation clearly mattered to him - whether it be donning NS green or Singapore red,"" said Mr Mohan. 
""His display of remarkable discipline and character really struck me and was one which I hoped to highlight through my feature.""
He added: ""Sports stories often run the risk of being too results-orientated. I wanted this piece to underscore that beyond the glitz and the glamour of winning, sportsmen put in an incredible amount of effort and that deserves attention.""
Mr Tan, 22, was last month named in coach Fandi Ahmad’s 23-man squad for a training camp in Japan, ahead of the SEA Games in the Philippines.
