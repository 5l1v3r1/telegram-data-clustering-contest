Robredo to get Cabinet post as drug czar – Palace
01 Nov 2019, 10:39 by Efren Montano
PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte will give a Cabinet Secretary rank to Vice President Leni Robredo should she accept his offer to be the administration’s drug czar, Malacañang yesterday said
“To dispel all doubts on the sincerity of the Chief Executive’s offer, as well as to put a halt to the discordant pessimism of the opposition, the President renews his offer to the Vice President to become the anti-illegal drugs czar, with all offices, bureaus, agencies or government instrumentalities involved in the enforcement of the law on prohibited drugs placed under her command and supervision with a Cabinet Secretary portfolio, to ensure her effectiveness in combating the drug menace,” presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo said in a statement.
Panelo said Duterte is again making the offer after “critics and detractors of this Administration described the President’s gesture as a trap, arguing that it is impossible for VP Leni to solve the social problem with a limited period of six months and without the support of anti-drug bureaus and agencies.”
“The Office of the President wishes to be categorical – and contrary to the claim of critics and detractors of this Administration, we want VP Leni to succeed, her success being ultimately a triumph of the Filipino people against the dreaded and destructive evil that is destroying the basic fabric of our society,” he said.
