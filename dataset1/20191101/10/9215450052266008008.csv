Twitter日前公布第3季業績，盈利及收入遜於預期，收入8.24億美元，按年升9%，比市場預期的8.76億美元為低，盈利錄得3,652萬美元，按年跌65%。Twitter表示，受廣告程式故障影響，導致7月及8月的廣告收入下跌。業績公布後，拖累股價一度暴跌超過 20%。外界都關注Twitter會否嘗試進入中國市場，開拓更多收入來源，Twitter財務總監Ned Segal就表明，沒有進軍中國的計劃，只會專注他們能夠進入的市場，並希望用戶能在信任的平台中看到訊息，能安全地參與對話與交流，意味Twitter不會進軍中國市場。

Twitter recently announced its third-quarter results, earnings and revenues were lower than expected, with revenue of $824 million, up 9% year-on-year, lower than market expectations of $876 million, and earnings of $36.52 million, down 65% year-on-year. Twitter said that due to the failure of the ad program, the advertising revenue in July and August fell. After the results were announced, the stock price plummeted by more than 20%. The outside world is concerned about whether Twitter will try to enter the Chinese market and open up more sources of income. Twitter financial director Ned Segal has indicated that there is no plan to enter China, only to focus on the markets they can enter, and hope that users can see in the platform of trust. To the message, it is safe to participate in dialogue and communication, which means that Twitter will not enter the Chinese market.
