Where to buy Football Manager 2020

Ever since initial launch as Championship Manager in 1992, the Football Manager games have been the definitive simulator for those looking to take charge of their favourite team. 
Combined with FIFA, it has provided a comprehensive video game experience for fans of the beautiful game. However, FM has always been considered more in-depth, offering granular control over nearly every aspect of how a club is run.
FM 2020 looks set to continue that trend, and will be released on 19 November. A fully playable beta is available now, having been released a full five days ahead of schedule.



If you're looking to pick up the game ahead of release, the good news is that you can pre-purchase now, meaning you'll be ready to download once it's available. The full version of the game will only be playable on PC and Mac, with Google Stadia to follow despite it also releasing on 19 November. 
FM Touch and FM Mobile will be available on both the App Store and Google Play on the same date. 
How to pre-purchase Football Manager 2020
You can pre-purchase the game now on the Football Manager website for £35.99, the cheapest we've seen. There is also the option to get Arsenal or Valencia versions, which gets you the official club kits, crest and player faces that wouldn't normally be available. 
If you'd like to order through Steam instead, you can pick it up for the same price, and it's the only place we've found it available if you're in the US ($44.99).
All these prices are complete with a 10% discount, which is only available if you order ahead of release day.
How to pre-order a physical copy
Physical copies of PC games are much rarer than their console equivalents, not least because so many laptops no longer have a disc drive. While it is still available for Windows devices, physical Mac games are not supported as they have been without one since 2011. 

Where to buy in the UK:

We haven't found anywhere to pre-order a physical copy in the US, but will update this if the situation changes.
