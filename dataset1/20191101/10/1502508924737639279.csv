While motorcycle sales were down by 16 per cent to 125,660 units this October from 150,429 units last year, scooter sales were lower by 20 per cent at 121,437 units, from 151,040 units last October.
The company's exports grew by 20 per cent from 57,926 units last October to 69,339 units in the same month this year. Two-wheeler exports were up 22 per cent, from 45,319 units in October 2018 to 55,477 units in October 2019.
