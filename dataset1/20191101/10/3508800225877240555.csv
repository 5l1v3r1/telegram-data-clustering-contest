防暴警察出現的萬聖節，沒有狂歡的自由
01 Nov 2019, 10:37 by 譚蕙芸


我們想讓你知道的是如果昨晚的萬聖節一夜，是讓民眾偶爾來一次脫離平日自我的Cosplay派對，透過裝扮來一次角色扮演，那末香港警察本身，應該是全港最大型的Cosplay群體之一。



香港骨子裡有一種娛樂至死的基因。前中共領導人鄧小平曾經說過一句話，用來安撫擔心1997回歸的香港人，他說，香港資本主義生活模式不變，可以「馬照跑，舞照跳」。意思是說，香港仍可以是糜爛的銷金窩，繼續夜夜笙歌。
夜生活，在香港有核心的意義，在夜總會裡，談生意，男歡女愛，道德放一邊，搵錢至上我們笑貧不笑娼；夜總會式娛樂，流行文化衍生出一種市井活力，歡樂今宵，嘻嘻哈哈，墮落的鴉片式麻醉式流行文化讓人暫忍現實生活的不如意，嘻笑怒罵的諷刺娛樂，卻讓社會的不滿找到喧洩的出口。
以前，香港人樂於膚淺，一窩蜂以消費或娛樂發洩不滿，殖民地在1967年暴動後，搞新潮舞會給年輕人，讓他們在樂與怒中麻醉自己，不會上街示威，不去想政治議題。
香港在過去幾個月，想鬆一鬆也越來越難，大型活動接二連三被取消。大受歡迎的海洋公園萬聖節活動，因為其中一個表演劇場節目涉及內容被政治審查，醞釀員工大罷工，竟然在萬聖節入場人數最高那一天，宣佈閉園休息。有生意也不做，政治因素干擾下，香港這個號稱最自由市場，一次又一次做出違反經濟學常理的決定。
連續4個多月的反修例示威，昨晚遇上一年一度的萬聖節。在中環蘭桂坊，地標式的旅遊點，每年萬聖節晚上，中外人士扮鬼扮馬狂歡派對舉行至深夜，怎知，昨晚又再一次遇上「非官方式宵禁」。
進出蘭桂芳的鐵路站，宣佈在最旺場時段的晚上9時關站。在蘭桂芳擺攤檔售賣煙仔瓶裝水已七旬的梅姐，見證蘭桂坊興衰，她記得，1993年大除夕在蘭桂芳斜路上，因人多擠逼人踩人而引致20多人死亡。她說，那天她看不到事件，因為她的攤檔在外圍。
見證過大時代興衰的梅姐，昨晚檔攤一反常態，昨晚8時許她就決定收檔，以往遇上節日定必經營至深宵：「我住港島東，港鐵停開，若果打到來，地面也沒巴士，不知如何回家。」七十多歲的她，語氣裡沒有驚怕，小時候連六七暴動也遇過，「萬聖節，最好睇是扮鬼扮馬，看誰人用最少的錢，扮得最恐怖就為之好。」昨晚不時諷刺時弊的造型出現，有人扮被水炮車射得全身藍色的市民，也有人戴上中港領導人的面具，也有九龍區的示威者把整個太子站戴在頭上。

梅姐收檔後，人潮漸多。7時，蘭桂坊的氣氛平靜，蘭桂坊自己聘請了大批穿白恤衫的保安，保安聽到我說「記者多過酒客」，忍不住笑。他們同意，若不是蘭桂坊大老闆盛智文和政府關係密切，警方在蘭桂坊的行為，應該更為失控。
蘭桂坊得到的「禮遇」，就是讓大批防暴警察在8時進場，站在最當眼的十字路口位置，他們最初穿着全副裝備，刻意不戴上頭盔（以減少威脅感？），但有不少警員還是戴上金屬製的口罩，那個口罩設計頗有荷里活連環殺手造型的味道。
晚上8時，以香港夜場的時間表來說，派對還未開始，一大班防暴警駐紥在派對大門，群眾非常憤怒，大家寧可不入酒吧喝酒，圍着防暴警察叫罵。有戴着紅色隱形眼鏡，瞳孔像流血一樣的男子用英語罵道：「你破壞了派對的氣氛！這天是萬聖節！」
昨日有一些畫面充滿荒誕感，由於近日在採訪現場看到不少頭破血流的畫面，看到一臉血痕的女士，瞪着眼跟警察口角，霋眼看下去，分不清那些血是真還是假，要多看幾眼，才分得清那是化粧顏料，但罵警察那種憤恨的眼神，卻偽裝不了。
政府早前推出蒙面法，在萬聖節成為了最諷刺的一條鬼法例。整條街的人，不是戴面具就是把臉畫成花臉貓，有防線的警員用低質素的擴音器大嗌（不知為何警察使用的咪高鋒永遠都是聽不到的）：「前排戴面罩的黑衣人，你除下面罩！」引來全場百人起哄回罵：「廢話！除你媽的！」。
8時半，據現場指揮官所說，由於港島其他地區的遊行人士，正準備來到中環，警方決定封鎖整個蘭桂坊，不准市民進入。有戴了骷髏頭面罩的父子、哆啦A夢等造型人士，失望地在防線外徘徊。群眾大嗌：「開路！」「光復老蘭！我要飲酒！」

記者整晚也和防線警察對峙，最初段，我旁邊個攝影記者，不斷和一名男警聊天，那男警站在一個死角，顯得很悶，有一搭沒一搭地回話：「我們工時很長，一天工作15小時，戴面罩，沒辦法，怕起底（被追蹤身分，進而自己及家人被騷擾）。」那個攝記把握機會，不斷告訴男警，記者不是壞人，囑咐對方別惡意對待記者。
對話還有一點可能，因為早段警察還未穿上裝備，未戴上頭盔，在場的副指揮官還裸臉說一些安撫的話：「我知道你們很不快樂，很憤怒，我是聽到的。我們不是來清場，只是告訴你們將有其他遊行人士加入，安全有風險。」群眾不受落，噓聲回應。
我不禁想，那種溫柔，和平日的暴烈，那個才是真實？8時半，警方宣佈封鎖蘭桂坊，所有防暴警察戴上頭盔，拿起圓盾，對話變成不可能，一切就又回到敵我分明狀態。警察看不順眼，用粗口回罵，向記者直噴胡椒，衝上前制服他們看不順眼的人，才是「常態」。
如果昨晚的萬聖節一夜，是讓民眾偶爾來一次脫離平日自我的Cosplay派對，透過裝扮來一次角色扮演，那末香港警察本身，應該是全港最大型的Cosplay群體之一。有攝記者跟警員說：「每次衝突，就像兩邊打架。」我補充：「不，不同的，這一邊有槍。」我指着男警身上掛着的長槍，男警不語。
防暴警察的墨綠色制服（俗稱韓國仔，來自韓國鎮壓年代的警察衣着），速龍那套只看到眼睛的全黑制服，配備的武器，每一次他們拿上手，穿戴上身，把警員的人性一點一滴挪走。有指揮官向報章承認：「警員蒙面後，做事就更過火。」加上沒有警員編號，外人難以識別身分。
有警員跟我討論過：「有些同事還知道，政府在利用我們處理政治問題，有些人會按章工作，不想之後成為犧牲品，但有一些則上晒頭（頭昏腦脹），做事過火。」我一句總結：「假戲真做。」

如此這般，晚上10時半，聚集的人群，在皇后大道中被驅趕，全副武裝的防暴警，天地任我行般在中上環疾走，他們大力地使用警棍毃打長盾，製造聲勢，他們用腳大力踢地上的路障（不過是一些垃圾埇和竹枝），不斷向空無一人的街道上放催淚彈，他們的呼喊聲、催淚彈殼掉落地下的金屬聲，槍聲在街頭的迴盪聲，是萬聖節一套最恐怖的畫面，只不過香港人已經習以為常。
有些超現實畫面是這樣的，防暴警在大馬路上疾走，行人路上還有戴着面具的遊人，像幽靈般飄過，敢經過又不太敢張望。一個頭罩大白鯊面具的男人，回頭一望，有一刻分不清，究竟這天的萬聖節派對，來參加的是小市民，還是百計防暴警。
有人以大熱電影《小丑》（Joker）的主角打扮到來，這位20歲電腦網頁設計師阿Ben告訴我，他花了好幾天找尋造型的化粧品和戲服，這天他在蘭桂芳成為焦點，不少人找他在拍照。在運動之中，他偶爾參與，但站得不太前，他說，這晚乘港鐵到中環，在港鐵站內碰到防暴警察：「我不敢正眼望他們，我不知道他們有沒有看着我。」香港人，這晚未能盡興，娛樂自己，竟也滿心虛歉。
只是想放蕩一晚，只是想輕鬆一宵，這樣卑微的權力，已經被政權的伸延輾壓粉碎。看着防暴警呼嘯而過，有一位站在中環暗黑街頭，穿着萬聖節圖案長黑袍的中年女士，眼淚鼻水因為催淚彈而流得一臉也是。
她站在街角，用怨恨的眼神望着警察，說了一句很有味兒、語帶雙關的廣東話：「邊有得玩？俾佢哋玩晒啦！」意思是，這個晚上根本沒有狂歡的可能，警察已經為所欲為了。

Halloween for riot police, no freedom of carnival
01 Nov 2019, 10:37 by Tan Wei


What we want you to know is that if Halloween last night is a Cosplay party that allows people to occasionally leave the weekdays, and play a role-playing role, then the Hong Kong police itself should be one of the largest Cosplay groups in Hong Kong. .



There is a gene of entertainment to death in Hong Kong. Former Chinese Communist Party leader Deng Xiaoping once said a word to appease Hong Kong people who are worried about the return of 1997. He said that Hong Kong's capitalist life pattern remains unchanged and that it can be ""running with horses and dancing."" This means that Hong Kong can still be a splendid sales nest and continue to sing songs every night.
Nightlife has a core meaning in Hong Kong. In nightclubs, talking about business, men and women love, morality is on the side, money is supreme, we laugh and we are not smiling; nightclub entertainment, popular culture has a kind of market vitality, joy and future, Hey, haha, the fallen opium-type anesthesia pop culture makes people temporarily endure the unsatisfactory real life, ridiculous irony and irony, but let the social dissatisfaction find a venting export.
In the past, Hong Kong people were very superficial, and they were dissatisfied with consumption or entertainment. After the colony rioted in 1967, they engaged in a new wave dance to young people, let them anesthetize themselves in music and anger, and did not go to the streets to demonstrate, not to think about political issues. .
In the past few months, Hong Kong has become more and more difficult to loosen up, and large-scale events have been cancelled one after another. The popular Ocean Park Halloween event, because one of the performance theater programs involved political censorship, brewing staff strikes, and announced the closing of the park on the day of the highest number of people entering Halloween. There is no business to do, and political factors interfere. Hong Kong, known as the free market, has repeatedly made decisions that violate economic common sense.
For more than four months of anti-reform demonstrations, I met the annual Halloween last night. In Lan Kwai Fong, Central, a landmark tourist spot, every night on Halloween night, Chinese and foreign people play ghosts and horses and partyes until late at night. How do I know that I have once again encountered a ""non-official curfew"" last night.
In and out of Lan Kwai Fong's railway station, it was announced that it would close at 9:00 pm during the most busy period. In Languifang's stall stall selling Yanzi bottled water has been 70-year-old Mei sister, witnessing the rise and fall of Lan Kwai Fong, she remembers that in 1993, the New Year's Eve was on the Lan Kwai Fong rampage, causing people to step on people and lead to 20 people. Many people died. She said that she could not see the incident that day because her stall was on the periphery.
Mei Sister, who witnessed the rise and fall of the Great Era, was uncharacteristically last night. At 8 o'clock last night, she decided to close the file. In the past, she would have to run into the squat: ""I live in Hong Kong Island, the MTR stops, if I play When I arrived, there was no bus on the ground. I don’t know how to go home.” In her seventies, she was not afraid of her tone. She even met the riots of the June 7th when she was a child. ""Halloween, it’s better to be a ghost and a horse. See who With the least amount of money, it’s best to dress up the most horrible.” From last night, there was a slap in the form of irony and sorrow. Some people dressed as water guns shot blue, and some people wore masks from Chinese and Hong Kong leaders. Demonstrators in the Kowloon area put the entire Prince Station on their heads.

After Mei Jie’s collection, there are more people. At 7 o'clock, the atmosphere of Lan Kwai Fong was calm. Lan Kwai Fong hired a large number of security guards wearing white shirts. The security guard heard me say that ""the reporter is more than an alcoholic"" and could not help but laugh. They agreed that if the boss of Lan Kwai Fong, Sheng Zhiwen, had close ties with the government, the police’s behavior in Lan Kwai Fong should be even more out of control.
The ""courtesy"" that Lan Kwai Fong got was to let a large number of riot police enter the scene at 8 o'clock and stand at the most conspicuous intersection. They were wearing full equipment and deliberately not wearing helmets (to reduce the threat?), but Many police officers still wear metal masks, and the mask design has the taste of Hollywood's serial killer.
At 8 o'clock in the evening, according to the timetable of the Hong Kong night scene, the party has not yet begun. A large group of riot police are stationed at the party gate. The masses are very angry. Everyone would rather not enter the bar to drink and scream around the riot police. There are men wearing red contact lenses, and the pupils are like bloodshed. They shouted in English: ""You broke the atmosphere of the party! This is Halloween!""
Yesterday, some pictures were full of absurdity. As I saw a lot of bloody pictures in the interview scene recently, I saw a woman with a bloody face, squinting at the policeman’s mouth, and staring at it. I can’t tell whether the blood is true or not. False, to look at a few more eyes, it is clear that it is a make-up paint, but the policeman’s resentful eyes can’t be disguised.
The government introduced the masked method earlier and became the most ironic ghost law on Halloween. The whole street is not wearing a mask or painting a face as a painted cat. A police officer with a line of defense yells at a low-quality loudspeaker (I don’t know why the police use the high-definition is never heard): In front of the black man wearing a mask, you have to remove the cover!"" attracted a hundred people from the audience to look back: ""Crap! Except your mother!"".
At 8:30, according to the on-site commander, as the demonstrators from other parts of Hong Kong Island were preparing to come to Central, the police decided to block the entire Lan Kwai Fong and the public was not allowed to enter. There are sculpt people such as father and son wearing a skull mask, Doraemon, etc., disappointed in the defense line. The crowd shouted: ""Open the road!"" ""Guangfu Laolan! I want to drink!""

The reporter also confronted the defense police all night. In the initial stage, a photojournalist next to me continued to chat with a male policeman. The male policeman stood in a dead corner and looked very boring. He did not take a ride and said: ""We work. It’s a long time, working 15 hours a day, wearing a mask, no way, afraid of the bottom (being tracked, and then being harassed by myself and my family).” The photo captures the opportunity and keeps telling the policeman that the reporter is not a bad person. Treat the reporter maliciously.
There is still a possibility of dialogue, because the police did not wear the equipment in the early stage, and did not wear a helmet. The deputy commander on the scene also said something to his face: ""I know that you are very unhappy, very angry, I heard. We are not coming to the scene, just telling you that there will be other demonstrators to join, and there is security and risk."" The masses are not affected and snoring.
I can't help but think that the gentle, peaceful violent, that is true? At 8:30, the police announced the blockade of Lan Kwai Fong. All the riot police put on their helmets and picked up the round shield. The dialogue became impossible and everything returned to the enemy and me. The police did not look pleasing to the eye, swearing back with a thick mouth, spraying pepper directly at the reporter, and rushing to the front to subdue those who could not look good, is the ""normal state.""
If last night's Halloween night is a Cosplay party that allows people to occasionally leave the weekday self, and the role play by dressing up, then the Hong Kong police itself should be one of the largest Cosplay groups in Hong Kong. A reporter and a police officer said: ""Every conflict is like fighting on both sides."" I added: ""No, different, there is a gun on this side."" I pointed at the long gun hanging on the male policeman, the policeman said nothing.
The dark green uniform of the riot police (commonly known as the Korean Aberdeen, the police from the age of the Korean repression), the Athlon's all-black uniform with only the eyes, equipped with weapons, each time they took the hand, put on the upper body, put the police officer's Humanity is removed bit by bit. Some commanders admitted to the newspaper: ""After the police officers are masked, it is even more difficult to do things."" Plus there is no police officer number, it is difficult for outsiders to identify the identity.
Some police officers have discussed with me: ""Some colleagues also know that the government is using us to deal with political issues. Some people will work according to the chapters. They don't want to be victims later, but some of them are on the head (stunned) and overworked. ""I summed it up: ""The fake play is done.""

In this way, at 10:30 in the evening, the crowd gathered, was expelled in Queen's Road, armed riot police, and the heavens and the earth rushed in the middle and upper ring. They vigorously used batons to beat long shields and create momentum. Use your feet to kick the roadblocks on the ground (but some garbage and bamboo branches), and continue to put tear gas on the empty streets. Their shouts, the tears of the shells, the metal sounds falling down, the sound of gunshots on the streets, It is the most horrible picture of Halloween, but Hong Kong people have become accustomed to it.
Some surreal pictures are like this. Anti-riot police sprinted on the road, and there were masked tourists on the pavement, drifting like ghosts, dare to go through and not dare to look around. A man with a hooded Great White Shark mask looked back and couldn't tell. It was a Halloween party on this day. It was a small citizen or a riot police.
Someone dressed up as the protagonist of the hot movie Joker, the 20-year-old computer web designer, Ben Ben, told me that he spent several days looking for styling cosmetics and costumes. This day he was at Lan Guifang. Became the focus, many people are looking for him to take pictures. During the campaign, he occasionally participated, but he did not stand too far. He said that he took the MTR to Central this night and met the riot police in the MTR station: ""I don't dare to look at them. I don't know if they have it. Look at me."" Hong Kong people, this night failed to enjoy themselves, entertain themselves, and actually apologized.
Just want to let go of a night, just want to take a sigh of relief, such humble power has been crushed and crushed by the regime. Looking at the riot police whistling, there is a middle-aged woman standing in the dark streets of Central, wearing a long black robe with a Halloween pattern, tears and nose water flowing through the tears.
She stood on the corner of the street and looked at the police with resentful eyes. She said a very Cantonese-speaking Cantonese-speaking slogan: ""Whether you have fun? Play with the sun!"" Means that there is no carnival at night. The possibility that the police have done what they want.
