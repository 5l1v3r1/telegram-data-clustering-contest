【星宇K董點子王】張國煒霸氣申請10航點　就等空巴新機來
01 Nov 2019, 10:23 by 徐珍翔, 董孟航
針對明（2020）年夏季航班，星宇航空已提出包含澳門、檳城、峴港在內，共10條航線的申請，不過，公關長聶國維表示，即便申請通過，也不一定能開闢航線，一切還是得看後續的交機狀況而定，「我們目前確定的，就是3架飛機，飛澳門、檳城、峴港3個航點。」
根據國際機場時間帶協調中心最新資料，星宇航空已申請明年夏季的台北澳門一天3班往返、台北峴港一天往返、台北檳城一天往返、台北亞庇一天往返、台北宿霧一天往返、台北松山一天往返、台北北九州一天往返、台北福州一天往返、台北重慶一天往返、台北北京一天往返等10個航班，初步已取得桃園機場時間帶。
對此，聶國維向本刊表示，除了確定開航的澳門、檳城、峴港3個航點外，其餘7個航點都只是星宇未來考慮規劃的航線，此次只是先向民航局提出申請，即便通過，也要視當時狀況才能決定是否開闢新航線。

據悉，星宇航空日前接回首架A321neo客機後，到年底之前可望再進2架，到明年開航時（1月23日），將有3架客機上線服務，即便一切順利，明年也頂多再引進3、4架新機，恐怕仍無法因應10個航點全開；星宇航空真正的爆發期在2021年，預計交機12架左右。
被問及飛機數量等問題，聶國維不諱言：「對方的時間帶好不好，還有到時候飛機夠不夠，都是我們最後決定的因素之一，……現階段，我們的3架飛機，就是飛澳門、檳城、峴港，只有這個是確定的，其他都要視情況而定。」

[Xingyu K Dongzizi Wang] Zhang Guofan domineering application for 10 waypoints
01 Nov 2019, 10:23 by Xu Zhenxiang, Dong Menghang
For Ming (2020) summer flights, Xingyu Airlines has applied for 10 routes including Macau, Penang and Da Nang. However, the public relations chief Nie Guowei said that even if the application is approved, it may not be able to open routes. Everything still depends on the subsequent traffic conditions. ""We are currently determining three aircraft, flying three destinations in Macau, Penang and Da Nang.""
According to the latest information from the International Airport Time Zone Coordination Center, Xingyu Airlines has applied for three round trips to Taipei, Macau, next summer, one day round trip to Taipei, one day round trip to Penang, Taipei, one day round trip to Kota Kinabalu, one day round trip to Taipei, and one day in Taipei. There are 10 flights between Songshan, one round trip to Taipei Kyushu, one round trip to Taipei Fuzhou, one round trip to Taipei, and one round trip to Taipei, Beijing. The Taoyuan Airport time zone has been obtained.
In this regard, Nie Guowei told this magazine that in addition to the three destinations of Macau, Penang and Da Nang, which are set to sail, the other seven destinations are only the routes planned by Xingyu in the future. This is only the first application to the Civil Aviation Administration. Even if it passes, it depends on the situation at that time to decide whether to open a new route.

It is reported that after Xingyu Airlines regained its first A321neo passenger plane, it is expected to enter two more aircraft by the end of the year. By the end of next year (January 23), there will be three passenger planes on-line service, even if everything goes well, next year will be at most The introduction of 3 or 4 new machines, I am afraid that it is still impossible to open up to 10 destinations; the real outbreak of Xingyu Airlines is in 2021, and it is expected to have about 12 flights.
When asked about the number of aircraft, Nie Guowei did not say: ""The time of the other party is good, and the time is not enough. It is one of the factors we decided.... At this stage, our three planes are Flying to Macau, Penang and Da Nang, only this is certain, and everything else depends on the situation.""
