周四超买拖累马股下跌
01 Nov 2019, 10:49 by Wong Ee Lin
（吉隆坡1日讯）马股昨日大涨后，投资者今日趁机套利离场，加上分析员认为市场缺乏新的催化剂，导致富时隆综指以1593.34点挂收，挫4.64点或0.29%。
乐天交易私人有限公司研究主管余贤彬表示，由于马股昨日“超买”，因此，今日下跌是“预料中事”。
他告诉theedgemarkets.com，市场缺乏新的催化剂去支撑买气。
富时隆综指昨日收于1597.98点，涨17.98点或1.14%，因美国周三降息，提振亚洲股市走高，马股则追踪亚股走势。
截至今日闭市，马股总成交量达27亿9000万股，总值16亿4000万令吉。下跌股包括大众银行（Public Bank Bhd）、发马（Pharmaniaga Bhd）与金务大（Gamuda Bhd）。
余贤彬还注意到今日令吉走强，在国家银行下周二（11月5日）宣布利率决定之前，外资流入了大马资产。
他指出，随着美国降息，国行应该会在周二维持隔夜政策利率，市场可能会看到外资进一步流入大马资产。
他说：“过去两天，我们看到令吉升值，也看到更多外资流入。”截稿时，令吉兑美元升至4.1648。

Overbought on Thursday dragged down the Malaysian stock market
01 Nov 2019, 10:49 by Wong Ee Lin
KUALA LUMPUR (April 1): After the Malaysian stock market surged yesterday, investors took the opportunity to leave the market today. Coupled with analysts' lack of new catalysts, the FBM KLCI closed at 1,593.34 points, down 4.64 points or 0.29%. .
Yu Xianbin, research director of Lotte Trading Pte Ltd, said that due to the “overbought” of the Malaysian stock market yesterday, the decline today is “anticipated”.
He told theedgemarkets.com that the market lacks new catalysts to support buying.
The FTSE KLCI closed at 1597.78 points yesterday, up 17.98 points or 1.14%. As the US cut interest rates on Wednesday, boosting Asian stocks higher, the Malaysian stocks tracked the trend of Asian stocks.
As of the close of the market today, the total number of Malaysian stocks reached 2.79 billion shares, with a total value of RM1.64 billion. Falling stocks include Public Bank Bhd, Pharmaniaga Bhd and Gamuda Bhd.
Yu Xianbin also noticed that the ringgit was stronger today. Before the National Bank announced the interest rate decision next Tuesday (November 5), foreign capital flowed into Malaysian assets.
He pointed out that as the US cuts interest rates, the Bank of China should maintain the overnight policy rate on Tuesday, and the market may see further foreign capital flowing into Malaysian assets.
He said: ""In the past two days, we have seen the appreciation of the ringgit and the increase in foreign capital inflows."" At the time of writing, the ringgit rose to 4.1648 against the US dollar.
