Video: Here's How Bloodstained's Switch Performance Update Compares To The Previous Version
Version 1.03 is here!
01 Nov 2019, 10:00 by Ryan Craddock



Earlier, we shared the news that Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night has now received its promised performance update on Nintendo Switch, taking the game from Version 1.02 to 1.03. The update has been long-awaited by fans who were left disappointed with the game upon release.
As such, we thought it best to also share with you this side-by-side comparison video so that you can see the changes for yourself. The video comes courtesy of Direct-Feed Games; after giving this a good once over ourselves, we'd say it's tricky to really notice any significant changes in the visuals department, but players are reporting much-improved load times and a decrease in input lag.



Those load times have reportedly been slashed by ""up to 70%"" and other issues like game-crashing bugs have also been addressed. If you stopped playing the game at launch thanks to its performance issues, now might be the time to jump back in for another go.

Will you be loading it up once again now that the new update is in place? Let us know in the comments below.
