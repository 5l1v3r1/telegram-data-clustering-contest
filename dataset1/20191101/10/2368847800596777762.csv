淫事無人知？他犯錯後為何極力行善補過？

01 Nov 2019, 10:51

南宋後期，有個人叫洪燾。一天他上廁所時，忽然昏倒了，在昏倒的那一刻元神離體。他元神離體後一看，原來是家中死去的僕人正拉他到陰府去。
到了陰府只見一位官員坐在中間，左右站著緋衣和綠衣的侍者。洪燾便問起自己的前程，綠衣侍者從衣袖中拿出一本手冊，上面的字很小，自己的名下的內容看不全，最後一行寫著：本應擔任參知政事，但因為在某年、某月、某日與家中的婢女發生不正當的性關係，官位降為秘閣修撰、轉運副使。
洪燾看到這則後注，不禁悚然淚下，說到：這可怎麼辦是好呢？綠衣侍者說：只要你努力行善，事情還是可以有所挽回的。
隨後，陰府的人又令他還陽。
洪燾元神回來甦醒後一問，原來自己在世間已昏死了三日，因心口窩還是暖的，故家人沒有將他入棺就殮。從此他就力行善事，希望能儘量挽回被削減的官祿。後來他果然像陰間中的記載那樣被委任為秘閣修撰、兩浙漕運，再往後他一直升官做到了端明殿學士，而且年享高壽。
人類如果在性的方面，違背正統的道德與禮儀規範亂來的話，那一定會使你蒙受巨大的損失，有志者萬萬不可在這方面犯錯啊！
如果過去犯了錯，那麼現在一定要努力改過絕不可再犯，而且還應該盡力彌補往日的過錯。
註：原文中誤把洪燾說成明朝人，經查閱有關資料發現洪燾實為南宋後期官員。

No one knows about sex? Why did he try his best to make up for it after he made a mistake?

01 Nov 2019, 10:51

In the late Southern Song Dynasty, there was a man named Hong Wei. One day when he went to the bathroom, he suddenly passed out. At the moment he passed out, the god was separated. When his god was separated from the body, he saw that the servant who was dead at home was pulling him to the Yin House.
When I arrived in the Yin government, I saw an official sitting in the middle, standing around the waiter in the robes and green clothes. Hong Yan asked about his future. The green waiter took out a manual from the sleeves. The words above were very small, and the contents under his name were not complete. The last line said: It should have served as a political officer, but Because of an improper sexual relationship with a prostitute at home in a certain year, month, and day, the official position was reduced to the secret agent and transfer assistant.
When Hong Yan saw this post-note, he couldn’t help but shed tears and said: What can be done about this? The green waiter said: As long as you work hard to do good, things can still be recovered.
Later, the people in the Yin government made him yang.
When Hong Yuyuan came back to wake up, he asked that he had been fainted for three days in the world. Because his heart was still warm, his family did not envy him. Since then, he has been doing good deeds, hoping to save the reduced official lord as much as possible. Later, he was appointed as the secret house of the secret house, and the two cities were promoted as the records in the underworld. Later, he has been promoted to a bachelor's degree in Duanming Temple, and enjoys a long life.
If human beings violate the orthodox morality and etiquette in the sexual aspect, it will definitely cause you huge losses. Those who are willing to make mistakes in this respect!
If you made a mistake in the past, you must try hard to change it now, and you should try your best to make up for the mistakes of the past.
Note: In the original text, Hong Yu was mistakenly described as a Ming Dynasty person. After consulting the relevant information, Hong Yu was actually an official of the late Southern Song Dynasty.
