01 Nov 2019, 10:12 by Alfred P. Dalizon
PATROLLING officers yesterday arrested a group of Chinese nationals who allegedly tried to abduct and beat another Chinese who owed them so-called ‘visa facilitation money’ outside the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 3, officials said.
The suspects were turned over by NAIA authorities to the Philippine National Police Anti-Kidnapping Group headed by Colonel Jonnel C. Estomo for further investigation and filing of criminal charges.
The suspects were accused of trying to drag Zenglin Zhou into a waiting van around 6:25 a.m. yesterday. The incident caught the attention of patrolling officers from the Airport Police Department and the PNP Aviation Security Group who promptly arrested the suspects.
Some of the suspects were identified as Cheng Yuqui, Xiong Yao, Zhao Xin, Liu Huan, Nie Shaolin, Huang Yuhang and Pan Chinglin. Their Filipino driver identified as Jesus Solinap Jr. was also placed under questioning.
Manila International Airport Authority general manager Ed Monreal said that during initial questioning, Zhou claimed that the suspects beat him up and burned his arm with cigarettes due to his failure to pay the P30,000 he owes one of the accused.
The suspects are believed to be members of a casino loan shark syndicate which has gained notoriety for offering huge loan to foreign casino players, mostly Chinese nationals with as much as 20 percent daily interest.
