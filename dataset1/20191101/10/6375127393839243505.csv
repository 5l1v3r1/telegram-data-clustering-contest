New quake hits off Sarangani

01 Nov 2019, 10:29

AS Filipinos flocked to cemeteries on All Saints’ Day a magnitude-5.50 quake shook Sarangani province in Mindanao Friday morning, just a day after a strong temblor left five people dead and destroyed buildings in Cotabato province and in Davao City.
The earthquake struck 334 kms southeast of Sarangani at 10:33 a.m. and had a depth of 33 kilometers.
It was tectonic in origin.
PHIVOLCS director Renato Solidum allayed concerns of a tsunami noting the quake distance which is already close to the Indonesian boundary and its magnitude which is relatively not too strong.
“Ito ay napakalayo na, mahigit 300 kilometro at ang magnitude na ito ay hindi ganun kalakihan 5.5 kaya hindi rin ito pwedeng magdulot ng tsunami. Kaya wala pong dapat ipangamba ang ating mga kababayan,” Solidum told GMA News TV’s Balitanghali.
“Unang-una ang lindol ay wala na sa sakop ng Pilipinas, ito po ay nasa Talaud, Indonesia. Nirefer lang natin dahil nalo-locate natin ang earthquake sa paligid ng Pilipinas at  kailangang bantayan din ang dagat sa Sarangani province,” he added.

New quake hits off Sarangani

US Filipinos flock to cemeteries on All Saints' Day a magnitude-5.50 quake shook Sarangani province in Mindanao Friday morning, just a day after a strong blast left five people dead and destroyed buildings in Cotabato province and in Davao City.
The earthquake struck 334 kms south of Sarangani at 10:33 a.m. and had a depth of 33 kilometers.
It was tectonic in origin.
PHIVOLCS director Renato Solidum allayed concerns of a tsunami noting the quake distance which is already close to the Indonesian boundary and its magnitude which is relatively not too strong.
“It is very far, over 300 kilometers and this magnitude is not as big as 5.5 so it cannot cause a tsunami. So there is nothing to worry about our countrymen, ”Solidum told GMA News TV’s Balitanghali.
“Initially the earthquake was out of the Philippines, it was in Talaud, Indonesia. We only respond because we can locate earthquakes around the Philippines and we need to guard the sea in Sarangani province, ”he added.
