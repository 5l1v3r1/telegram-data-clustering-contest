The House of Representatives voted to begin the next phase of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump — one which will be open to public scrutiny.
Two Democrats in the House broke ranks and voted against the resolution, which outlined rules for the impeachment process. That was the only complication to an otherwise clean partisan split, with all House Republicans voting against the measure.
The tally foreshadowed the battle to come as Democrats take their case against the president fully into public view. Today, we discuss what the next phase of the inquiry will look like.

On today’s episode:


Julie Hirschfeld Davis, the congressional editor for The New York Times.

Background coverage:


House Democrats decided they now have enough confidence in the severity of the underlying facts about Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine to open the inquiry to the public, despite the risk that doing so would further polarize the electorate.
This is a timeline of the events that prompted the impeachment inquiry.
Here’s how Democrats and Republicans voted on the impeachment rules resolution.
