【香港GDP下跌】香港政局不穩，社會事件持續，香港經濟衰退情況陸續出現。政府統計處10月31日發布2019年第三季本地生產總值GDP預先估計數字，根據資料，2019年第三季本地生產總值GDP較上年同期實質下跌2.9%，這是自2009年「環球經濟大衰退」以來首次錄得季度按年跌幅。首三季合計，香港經濟按年收縮0.7%。經季節性調整後按季比較，實質本地生產總值GDP繼上一季下跌0.5%後，在第三季的跌幅擴大至3.2%，顯示香港經濟已步入技術性衰退。

香港GDP連續兩季負增長 已步入技術性衰退
政府發言人表示，根據預先估計數字，2019年第三季整體經濟表現欠佳，本地生產總值GDP下跌是由於內部及對外需求均表現疲弱所致。香港經濟增長在全球經濟放緩和中美貿易摩擦的影響下，自去年起已拾級而下。最近更受到本地社會事件嚴重衝擊，情況急轉直下。隨着環球製造業和貿易活動進一步放慢，第三季香港整體貨物出口跌幅擴大。

訪港旅遊業受重創
本地社會事件令訪港旅遊業受到重創，服務輸出錄得自二零零三年第二季以來最大的按年跌幅。內部需求明顯轉差。經濟下滑削弱消費情緒，連串大型示威活動對零售、飲食和其他消費相關行業造成重大干擾，私人消費開支按年下跌，為超過十年以來首次；經濟信心低迷，整體投資開支的跌勢加劇。

影響私人消費和投資情緒
由於環球經濟增長短期內料會維持偏軟，香港出口難望有明顯改善，加上本地社會事件的衝擊未見有減退跡象，將繼續影響私人消費和投資情緒，今年餘下時間香港經濟仍會面對顯著的下行壓力。近月所有企業調查均顯示，本地營商氣氛變得非常悲觀。考慮到今年首三季合計經濟按年收縮0.7%，以及經濟表現短期內難有起色，2019年全年經濟很可能會呈現負增長。

政府較早前已表示考慮到2019年上半年0.5%的實際按年增長，表現遠遜預期，以及下行風險顯著，今年全年實質本地生產總值GDP增長預測，由五月覆檢時的2至3%，下調至八月覆檢的0至1%。香港本地生產總值已連續兩季錄得負增長，即等於步入技術性衰退。根據紀錄，香港對上一次錄得技術性衰退，已是2008年金融海嘯後，因此政府早前預告第三季本地生產總值錄得負增長後，普遍社會各界對本港經濟展望轉趨悲觀。
