""It's like I'm a naughty child and I have to stand outside on the naughty step or something.

""Staff members are eyeballing while I'm stood outside - it's a little bit embarrassing more than anything,"" Rakel added.
""It has just been blown out of proportion and now I have to stand outside like a naughty child.""
