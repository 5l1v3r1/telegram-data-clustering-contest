The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Friday said a new cyclonic storm, named ‘Maha’, has formed in the Arabian Sea.
The cyclone is approximately 1,140 kilometres from Karachi with wind speeds between 90 and 110 kilometres per hour.
‘Maha’ is currently moving in a northwesterly direction. However, the met department said the coastline of Pakistan is not threatened by the storm.
No rain is expected in Karachi as per weather forecasts.
The Met Office also said that the previous storm, ‘Kyarr’, had already lost its intensity over the Arabian Sea before ‘Maha’ formed.
“Cyclone Kyarr will weaken further until it dies down without hitting any coastal areas,” said Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz.
