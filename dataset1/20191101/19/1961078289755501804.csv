Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors will miss at least three months after undergoing surgery on Friday in Los Angeles on his broken left hand.
The Warriors announced on Friday that the next update on Curry’s status will come in three months, meaning that the star guard will likely miss a minimum of 45 games.
Early in the third quarter of Golden State’s 121-110 loss to the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday night, Curry drove to the basket and collided in midair with the Suns’ burly center Aron Baynes, who appeared to land hard on Curry’s left arm after first trying to take a charge.
The Warriors announced during the fourth quarter that Curry had broken his hand, yet another blow to their backcourt. Klay Thompson, the other half of the so-called Splash Brothers, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in Game 6 of the N.B.A. finals and could miss the entire season. Warriors officials have said that the next update on Thompson’s status can be expected around the All-Star break in mid-February.
