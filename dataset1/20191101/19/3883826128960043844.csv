One witness, who did not wish to be named, said he was in his living room when ""we literally heard a loud bang"".
""It didn't sound like a car crash, it was a really weird noise,"" he said.
""I went out to take a look and saw the carnage. My son is 11 and he was really upset. We didn't really want to stay outside as it was too upsetting really.""
He said one of the buses had gone into a front garden.
""My heart goes out to those involved. Very distressing,"" he added.


The GoAhead single-decker bus was lifted by crane on to a tow truckTariq Sheikh/photosheikh.com

Another resident, Tariq Sheik, said he heard ""an awful lot of ambulance and fire engine noises last night"" and thought it might have been connected to Halloween.
""Horrific scenes, it's not very pleasant,"" he added.
Road closures are in place around the area and police have advised motorists to use alternative routes.
Six bus routes have also been diverted.
Detectives have appealed for any witnesses or anyone with dashcam, mobile phone or CCTV footage of the collision to contact them.
