01 Nov 2019, 19:02

JEDDAH: Sophisticated and elegant, Amara Terrace restaurant in Jeddah is more than just a food experience.Located across from the Hilton Hotel, the eatery offers expansive views over one of the city’s main streets from its top-floor dining area, which coupled with its slow, low music creates a romantic atmosphere.And for customers not wanting a full meal, there is a relaxing seating area for coffee and desserts.Amara Terrace’s menu is characterized by its oriental, European and international dishes, and includes vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options.It is a restaurant that never disappoints; our favorite platter was fettuccini, with a balance of spices offering a true flavor of Italy.Staff are attentive and professional, and quick to give informed menu suggestions on a range of delicious dishes.
