It's been several weeks since we last checked in to see the progress Google was making towards its apparent goal of signing every single financial institution in America up for Google Pay support. Unsurprisingly, Google's been very busy throughout this period, and today we're looking at all the new banks ready to work with the service.
This update's a big one, since we've been cataloging all the new banks Google has brought on board since early August. Not all went live at the same time, but instead we've been seeing them arrive in fits and starts over the course of the past month-and-change. Here's what's new:
