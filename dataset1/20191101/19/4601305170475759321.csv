“You can wake her up at 5AM, she won't complain.”

Slavery is one of many industries made more efficient by Silicon Valley, and specifically, Facebook-owned Instagram.
A new BBC investigation reveals the widespread online sale of human beings in the mideast for domestic labor. The buyers and sellers use services from Instagram, Facebook, Apple, and Google to facilitate slavery transactions.
Housekeepers and nannies are purchased and sold as slaves through Instagram, promoted using hashtags, and promoted on other apps in Google Play and Apple's App Store.
These workers live their lives in Kuwait mostly behind closed doors, invisible and with no rights to protest abuse by their employer/enslavers.
Excerpt:
After being alerted to the issue, Facebook said it had banned one of the hashtags involved.Google and Apple said they were working with app developers to prevent illegal activity. The illegal sales are a clear breach of the US tech firms' rules for app developers and users.However, the BBC has found there are many related listings still active on Instagram, and other apps available via Apple and Google.
