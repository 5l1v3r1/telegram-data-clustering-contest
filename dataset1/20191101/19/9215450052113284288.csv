減息＋放寬按保推高樓市！業主狂反價！買樓要有呢個準備
01 Nov 2019, 19:17 by 樓市
上月施政報告出台後，放寬按揭保險的措施令樓市由冷轉熱； 如今滙豐更帶頭減息，確實為樓市火上加油，一眾業主心雄，瘋狂反價。美國減息是預計之內，原先市場預期香港不會跟減。然而，滙豐帶頭減息，多家銀行隨即跟減，確實感到意外。萊坊執行董事兼估價及諮詢主管林浩文表示，滙豐減息後，估計其他銀行也會跟隨，以保持競爭力及市場佔有率，這同時亦反映市場競爭大及生意難做，如果息口長期持續「低水平」，會對樓市有一定支持。

100萬元貸款額 每月供少66元
林浩文續指出，在政府的新政策下，600萬元至1,000萬元的二手樓仍會「亢奮三至四個月」，估計這類別的成交量亦會多兩至三成，但「盤源」及「購買力」會慢慢消耗。經絡按揭轉介高級副總裁曹德明預料，大部分銀行的最優惠利率（P）將回復至去年9月加息前的水平。早前施政報告放寬按揭成數措施，相信可刺激交投增多，激活樓市發展。不過，自6月起多間銀行已開始收緊按揭優惠如現金回贈及提高按息，曹德明相信減息後按揭業務的邊際利潤將更見低微，加上經濟前景不明朗，銀行承辦按揭業務時將會更加審慎，不排除銀行會再將按揭優惠減少。

中原按揭董事總經理王美鳳指出，P下降0.125厘後，新造按息將由2.625厘降至2.5厘，由於年內美息及港息再下調機會不大，預料年內按息將維持2.5厘低水平，連同最近推出新按保修訂，相信對本港樓市具支持作用。以貸款額100萬元、30年期計算，以減息前P按2.625厘計，每月供款為4,017元，減息0.125厘後，每月供款會減少66元，至每月3,951元（見表二），以目前新造按揭平均貸款額約400萬元計，減息0.125厘， 每月供款將節省264元，利息支出減少417元。

樓價將止跌回升
差餉物業估價署公布，本港9月私人住宅單位售價指數報380.5點， 按月跌1.8%，跌幅較8月的1.4%為大，連跌4個月，但這只是滯後數據。利嘉閣地產總裁廖偉強表示，低息環境將有助樓市交投回升及樓價回穩，預期第四季餘下時間，樓價有望止跌回升，並修訂全年樓價由原先估計的持平，變為較年初時仍有3%至5%的升幅（見表三）。事實上，自施政報告放寬按保後，市場已憧憬樓價上升，各區睇樓量急升，刺激業主叫價企硬，二手市場隨即錄得多宗反價個案。而由於政府放寬800萬元以下物業按保上限，有利該類價位物業的交投。



有沙田區代理消息指，區內指標屋苑沙田第一城44座中層兩房戶， 在施政報告出台前叫價540萬元，出台後即加價至550萬元，及後見市道暢旺，再反價至560萬元。日前再即提價到568萬元，由於不乏買家出價，故再調升2萬元，最新開價570萬元，以實用面積284平方呎計，每呎叫價2萬元。即使是不反價，都「零議價」。世紀21奇豐物業高級分行經理李嘉文表示，沙田第一城41座低層D室， 實用面積304平方呎，2房間隔。單位放盤1個月，獲買家「零議價」以510萬元承接，實用呎價16,776元。據了解，原業主於2009年7月購入上址，當時作價141萬元，持貨10年多至今沽售，賬面獲利369萬元離場，單位期內升值2.6倍。


代理消息指，元朗區上月錄得過百宗成交，遠超8月全月81宗，其中過半數成交是為《施政報告》公布後錄得。

業主心雄持續反價
於7月21日發生襲擊事件的元朗區，整體二手成交量自政府公布放寬按揭保險後，買家入市意欲上升，區內成交量更大增，更不時有反價個案。代理消息指，元朗區上月錄得過百宗成交，遠超8月全月81宗，其中過半數成交是為《施政報告》公布後錄得。中原地產副區域營業經理王勤學表示，其中YOHO Midtown 1座中高層G室，實用面積443平方呎，2房間隔，原業主最初叫價760萬元，期後反價10萬元或1.3%後，以770萬元售出，實用呎價17,381元（見表四）。
原業主於2010年以308萬元購入上址，持貨9年，賬面獲利462萬元，物業升值1.5倍。另一新界西大型指標屋苑荃灣愉景新城，亦接連錄得反價個案。美聯物業首席聯席區域經理梁仲維表示，剛錄得愉景新城1座極低層B室，實用面積474平方呎，8月開價650萬元放盤，日前反價至665萬元沽，平均呎價14,030元。 對比月中成交同層另一個同戶型單位做價，再高出27萬元。



加速入市步伐
中原地產分區營業經理陳旭明表示，自從宣布放寬按揭成數後，東涌二手成交持續暢旺，日前東堤灣畔5座高層F室，實用面積607平方呎，以768萬元沽出，成交價屬同類單位近4個月新高，實用呎價12,652元。買家為區內用家，睇樓一星期，期間亦有出價洽購其他單位，均慢半拍而未能成功入市，近日洽購上址，鍾情單位處高層，馬上追價40萬元承接單位。原業主於2013年以550萬元入市，現轉手賬面獲利218萬元，升值40%。
二線屋苑一樣有反價個案。中原地產分行經理朱建宗表示，近日新屯門中心業主心態轉強，新近錄得反價成交為3座高層F室，實用面積455平方呎，兩房間隔，原先叫價510萬元。單位近日獲買家洽購，業主有見樓市氣氛升溫，臨場反價5萬元， 買家為上車客，唯恐遲買更貴，決定追價，單位以515萬元成交，折合實用呎價約11,319元。原業主1994年11月以135萬元買入，持貨約25年，帳面獲利380萬元，升值約2.8倍。
不過，有經濟學者指出，政府放寬八至九成樓宇按揭上限及減息， 短期需求可被釋放，但之後的樓價走勢如遇上經濟轉差，走勢會後勁不繼，市民始終仍要面對樓價下行的風險，故不一定需要入市，如無必要的情況下也不應該入市，特別是炒樓。故此不認為反價封盤潮會持續很久，料只是曇花一現。
非套現轉按一樣可受惠
政府放寬按保，雖然只適用於現樓物業，對於樓花新樓，買家要選用建期付款才能選用新按保計劃，但同時新按保適用於非套現轉按，料有利延伸至承造發展商按揭的新盤買家於入伙後轉按。近年大部分新盤發展商提供高成數一按及二按讓買家以低首期入市，但平息蜜月期過後，業主須承造以倍增的高息償還貸款。若想轉按至傳統銀行，最高只可借物業樓價6成，亦要考慮通過壓力測試及資金填補差額等。
據經絡按揭統計資料顯示，由2016年至今，近4年錄得的樓花按揭有近37,400萬宗，當中約3,646宗是借發展商按揭上會，佔整體比例約9.75%。換言之，近年每10個承造樓花按揭個案之中，就有1名買家透過借發展商按揭上車。假若該批尚未還清貸款或已轉往其他銀行機構，估計有機會即時受惠新按保計劃。

入市要量力而為
事實上，政府放寬首置按揭後，發展商賣一手樓花時，除了在價錢上克制，以保持競爭力之外，更要在付款辦法上出招，方可吸納客源回流一手市場。當中近期市場焦點一手樓屯門的恒大•珺瓏灣，提供9成一按，首2年更加免息，另推出代繳印花稅優惠，上限為成交價的3%；青衣明翹匯亦提供8成一按，首2年的息率亦有優惠，為P減2.875厘，日後入伙再轉按予銀行使用新按保計劃，兼可繼續享低息。
建築、測量、都市規劃及園境界立法會議員謝偉銓認為，在新的按保計劃下，承做八成或九成按揭的申請人須是首次置業且入息固定，要求較一般按揭用家嚴謹，即使可透過支付較大比例的保費以避過較嚴格的壓力測試，申請人仍要通過信貸報告及評分。買家亦要量力而為，在入市前審慎計算因低首期而帶來的額外每月供款和保費開支，以及在經濟逆轉下對自身供款能力的影響。

Interest rate reduction + relaxation to push up the property market! The owner is mad! Buying a building must have a preparation
01 Nov 2019, 19:17 by the property market
After the introduction of the policy address last month, the measures to relax mortgage insurance have turned the property market from cold to hot; now HSBC is taking the lead in cutting interest rates, which really fuels the property market, and the owners are eager to reverse prices. The US interest rate cut is expected, and the original market expects that Hong Kong will not be reduced. However, HSBC took the lead in cutting interest rates, and many banks immediately followed suit, which was really unexpected. Lin Haowen, executive director and director of valuation and consulting at Knight Frank, said that after HSBC cut interest rates, it is estimated that other banks will follow to maintain competitiveness and market share. This also reflects the market competition and difficult business. If the interest rate is long-term Continued ""low level"" will have certain support for the property market.

1 million yuan loan amount, 66 yuan per month
Mr Lam continued to point out that under the new policy of the Government, second-hand buildings of $6 million to $10 million will still be ""exciting for three to four months"". It is estimated that the transaction volume in this category will be two to 30% more. And ""purchasing power"" will be consumed slowly. Cao Deming, senior vice president of Meridian Mortgage Referral, expects that the most favorable interest rate (P) of most banks will return to the level before the rate hike in September last year. The earlier policy address relaxed the measures for mortgages, which is believed to stimulate the increase in trading and activate the property market. However, since June, many banks have started to tighten mortgage concessions such as cash rebates and interest rates. Cao Deming believes that the marginal profit of mortgage business will be even lower after the interest rate cut, and the economic outlook is uncertain. When banks undertake mortgage business. It will be more prudent and it will not be ruled out that banks will reduce their mortgage offers.

Wang Meifeng, the managing director of the Central Plains Mortgage, pointed out that after the decrease of 0.125%, the new interest rate will be reduced from 2.625% to 2.5%. As the interest rate of the US and the interest rate will be lowered again during the year, it is expected that the interest rate will remain low at 2.5% during the year. The level, together with the recent introduction of the new insurance reform, is believed to support the property market in Hong Kong. With a loan amount of 1 million yuan and 30 years, the P before the interest rate reduction is 2.625%, and the monthly contribution is 4,017 yuan. After the interest rate reduction is 0.125%, the monthly contribution will be reduced by 66 yuan to 3,951 yuan per month. (See Table 2). With the current average loan amount of new mortgages of about 4 million yuan, the interest rate will be reduced by 0.125%, the monthly contribution will save 264 yuan, and the interest expense will be reduced by 417 yuan.

Property prices will stop falling
The Rating and Valuation Department announced that the price index of private residential units in Hong Kong was 380.5 points in September, down 1.8% month-on-month. The decline was larger than the 1.4% in August. It was only 4 months, but this is only lagging data. Liao Weiqiang, President of Lijiage Real Estate, said that the low interest rate environment will help the property market to rebound and property prices to stabilize. It is expected that the property price is expected to stop falling and the property price will be revised and the revised annual property price will be changed from the original estimate. There was still a 3% to 5% increase from the beginning of the year (see Table 3). In fact, since the policy report has been relaxed, the market has risen in price, and the number of flats in various districts has soared, stimulating the asking price of the owners. The second-hand market immediately recorded more counter-price cases. As the government relaxes the property insurance limit of less than 8 million yuan, it is beneficial to the trading of such price-priced properties.



In Sha Tin District, the agent said that the middle-level two-bedroom households in Block 44 of Sha Tin City, the index housing estate in the district, had a price of 5.4 million yuan before the policy report was issued. After the introduction of the policy report, the price was increased to 5.5 million yuan, and the market was prosperous. The price is 5.6 million yuan. Recently, the price was raised to 5.68 million yuan. Since there is no shortage of buyers' bids, it will be raised by 20,000 yuan. The latest price is 5.7 million yuan, with a practical area of 284 square meters, and the price is 20,000 yuan per baht. Even if it is not anti-price, it is ""zero bargaining"". Li Jiawen, senior manager of the 21st Century Qifeng Property Branch, said that the 41st low-rise D room in the first city of Shatian has a usable area of 304 square feet and 2 rooms. The unit was put on the market for one month, and the buyer was ""zero bargained"" to take over $5.1 million. The practical price was 16,776 yuan. It is understood that the original owner purchased the upper site in July 2009, at the time of the price of 1.41 million yuan, the sale of goods for more than 10 years so far, the book profit of 3.69 million yuan left the market, the value of the unit rose 2.6 times.


According to the agency news, Yuen Long District recorded over 100 transactions last month, far exceeding the total of 81 cases in August. More than half of the transactions were recorded after the announcement of the Policy Address.

Owners continue to reverse prices
In Yuen Long District, where the attack occurred on July 21, the overall second-hand transaction volume has increased since the government announced the relaxation of mortgage insurance. Buyers’ interest in the market has increased, and the volume of transactions in the region has increased even more. According to the agency news, Yuen Long District recorded over 100 transactions last month, far exceeding the total of 81 cases in August. More than half of the transactions were recorded after the announcement of the Policy Address. Zhong Qin Real Estate Deputy Regional Business Manager Wang Qinxue said that YOHO Midtown 1 middle and high-rise G room, 443 square feet of practical area, 2 rooms separated, the original owner originally called the price of 7.6 million yuan, after the period price of 100,000 yuan or 1.3%, to 770 Ten thousand yuan sold, the practical price of 17,381 yuan (see Table 4).
The original owner purchased the upper site in 2010 for 3.08 million yuan, holding the goods for 9 years, the book profit was 4.62 million yuan, and the property appreciation was 1.5 times. Another large-scale indicator estate in the New Territories West, Discovery Park, Tsuen Wan, also recorded anti-price cases. Liang Zhongwei, the chief joint regional manager of Midland Realty, said that he had just recorded a very low-rise B room in Discovery New Town, with a usable area of 474 square feet. The price of August was 6.5 million yuan. The price was reversed to 6.65 million yuan, and the average price was 14,030. yuan. Compared with the monthly transaction, the price of another unit of the same unit in the same floor was 270,000 yuan higher.



Accelerate the pace of entering the market
Zhong Xuming, the business manager of Zhongyuan Real Estate, said that since the announcement of the relaxation of the mortgage number, the second-hand transaction in Tung Chung has continued to flourish. Recently, the high-rise F, 5th floor of Dongdi Bay, has a saleable area of 607 square feet and was sold for 7.68 million yuan. The unit has a new high of nearly 4 months, and the practical price is 12,652 yuan. The buyer is a user in the district. During the week, there are also bids to purchase other units. They are all slow to shoot half a shot and fail to enter the market. Recently, they have purchased the upper address, and they are in charge of the high-rise unit. unit. The original owner entered the market with a price of 5.5 million yuan in 2013, and now he has transferred his account with a profit of 2.18 million yuan, an appreciation of 40%.
There are anti-price cases like the second-tier housing estates. Zhong Jian Real Estate Branch Manager Zhu Jianzong said that the mentality of the new Tuen Mun Center owners has recently strengthened. Recently, the counter-price transaction has been recorded as three high-rise F rooms. The practical area is 455 square feet, and the two rooms are separated. The original price was 5.1 million yuan. The unit has been negotiated by buyers recently. The owner has seen the property market warming up. The counter price is 50,000 yuan. The buyer is the passenger. I am afraid that it will be more expensive to buy later. The price is changed by 5.15 million yuan, which is equivalent to the actual price. About 11,319 yuan. The original owner bought it for 1.35 million yuan in November 1994, holding the goods for about 25 years, and the book profit was 3.8 million yuan, an appreciation of about 2.8 times.
However, some economists have pointed out that the Government has relaxed the mortgage ceiling and interest rate cuts of 80% to 90%. The short-term demand can be released. However, if the property price trend follows the economic downturn, the trend will not continue and the public will still have to face it. For the risk of falling property prices, it is not necessary to enter the market. If it is not necessary, it should not enter the market, especially the speculation. Therefore, I do not think that the anti-price sealing tide will last for a long time, which is expected to be short-lived.
Non-cash-to-return can be benefited
The Government has relaxed the insurance policy. Although it is only applicable to the existing building property, for the new building in Louhua, the buyer must use the construction period payment to select the new insurance plan, but at the same time, the new insurance policy applies to the non-cash resale, which is beneficial to the construction. The new purchaser of the developer's mortgage will be re-submitted after the occupation. In recent years, most of the new disc developers have offered high-volume one-and-two-per-clicks to allow buyers to enter the market with a low initial period. However, after the honeymoon period has passed, the owners have to repay large loans with high interest rates. If you want to transfer to a traditional bank, you can only borrow 60% of the property price. You should also consider filling the gap through stress tests and funds.
According to the statistics of the Meridian Mortgage, from 2016 to the present, there have been nearly 374 million mortgages in the past four years, of which about 3,646 were mortgaged by developers, accounting for about 9.75% of the total. In other words, among the 10 mortgage flats in recent years, one of the buyers has mortgaged the developer. If the lot has not been repaid or transferred to other banking institutions, it is estimated that there is an opportunity to benefit immediately from the new insurance plan.

Entering the market
In fact, after the government relaxed the first mortgage, when developers sell a flat, they are not only restrained in terms of price, but also in order to maintain their competitiveness. They must also make a move in the payment method to attract customers to return to the market. Among them, Evergrande and Tsuen Wan, which have a focus on the market in the near future, provide a 90% deposit. The first two years are more interest-free. Another stamp duty concession is introduced. The upper limit is 3% of the transaction price. Tsing Yi Ming Cheung Hui also provides 8 In the first two years, the interest rate is also discounted, which is 2.875% for P. In the future, it will be transferred to the bank to use the new insurance plan, and it can continue to enjoy low interest rates.
Mr Tse Wai-kwai, Member of the Legislative Council of the Building, Surveying, Urban Planning and Gardening Sector, believes that under the new insurance scheme, applicants who undertake a mortgage of 80% or 90% must be first-time home buyers and have a fixed income. The requirements are more stringent than those of ordinary mortgage users. Even if a larger percentage of premiums can be paid to avoid a more rigorous stress test, applicants still have to report and rate credits. Buyers must also do their best to carefully calculate the additional monthly contributions and premiums incurred as a result of the low initial period before entering the market, and the impact on their ability to contribute under the economic downturn.
