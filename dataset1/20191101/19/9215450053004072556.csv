1. 18元買入小米的部署
老師，我18元買入小米集團（1810），應該棄船還是等「返家鄉」？

龔成老師：

其實小米集團（1810）有增長力的，因為其產品的確受歡迎，同時處於增長狀態中。但估值是最大的問題，因小米不斷燒銀紙，同時沒人知何時有較理想的現金流，大家只是憑「將來價值」去推斷，因此股價波動，市場估值經常處於不一的狀態。
所以，你要預小米將來慢慢向好，但未有確定時間，這刻小米仍未有較好的盈利，如果你持貨不多，可以博其將來發展，但沒人知結果。如果這股只是投資小注，相信沒有問題，小米前景算正面，只是有較多不確定因素。如果你持貨較多，就要賣掉部分，以減低風險。
2. 融創中國的發展潛力
龔成老師，想請教一下，融創中國（1918）發展潛力大嗎？因為其盈利高，但負債重。

龔成老師：

融創中國（1918）近年的生意好，是由於中國樓市唱旺，但這不是沒有風險的。首先，中國樓市如果逆轉，融創會有很大打擊，另外，這股的負債超高，無事就無事，有事大件事。因此，投資這股不是不可，因為不是完全無質素，但你要明白背後的風險，同時明白這會令股價較波動，最好控制注碼。
3. 平穩增長股—恆基
老師，看過你推介，想加多一隻恆基（0012）入組合，平穩增長！看過你的介紹，恆基有很多香港新界地，發展起來的增長力應該不錯，你覺得月供有沒有問題？

龔成老師：

恆基（0012）可以加到組合內，這股本身持有不少有質素的資產，例如地產，以及煤氣（0003）等，潛力之一是恆基持有很多新界的農地，在長遠計有一定的發展。所以，你可以長期月供這股。
4. 金沙不用留現金發展？
龔老師您好，想問金沙在上一年為甚麼做到每年$1.99之派息？每股盈利才$1.82，難道不用留現金作再發展？求指點，謝謝

龔成老師：

首先，金沙（1928）有足夠的現金儲備，這點令其有一定的資金派息，另一最大因素，是其現金流強，每年都超過$200億的經營現金流，這點令金沙有足夠資金去派息，同時有部分資金去發展。金沙處於現金流大過盈利的狀態，反映企業具相當質素，有足夠現金派息。
5. 收息之選 收息股VS的士牌
老師：如果收息股及的士牌比較，那個用來收息比較好呢？

龔成老師：

收息股會較好，的士牌雖然有穩定的現金流，但大部分投資者投資的士牌，都是利用借貸模式，這會令現金流有變化。同時，的士牌的牌價波動大，具一定風險。投資收息股，不能只集中一隻，要建立一個組合，就會令風險減少。

18 yuan to buy millet! To abandon the ship or wait for ""hometown"" | Gong Chengxin Box
01 Nov 2019, 19:18 by Gong Cheng
The Hang Seng Index rose above 27,000 points. Many readers are optimistic about the market outlook. I would like to ask Mr. Gong Cheng's comments on blue chip stocks and individual stocks. Let's take a look at Gong Cheng's suggestion!

1. 18 yuan to buy millet deployment
Teacher, I bought Xiaomi Group (1810) for 18 yuan. Should I abandon the ship or wait for ""hometown""?

Teacher Gong Cheng:

In fact, Xiaomi Group (1810) has growth, because its products are indeed popular and growing. However, the valuation is the biggest problem. Because Xiaomi keeps burning silver paper, and no one knows when there is a better cash flow, everyone just infers with ""future value"", so the stock price fluctuates and the market valuation is often in a different state.
Therefore, you have to pre-mimily improve the future, but there is no certain time. At this moment, Xiaomi still has no good profit. If you do not have enough goods, you can develop it in the future, but no one knows the result. If this stock is just a small investment note, I believe there is no problem. The outlook of Xiaomi is positive, but there are more uncertain factors. If you have more goods, you must sell some of them to reduce the risk.
2. Sunac China's development potential
Teacher Gong Cheng, I would like to ask if Sunac China (1918) has great development potential? Because of its high profitability, its liabilities are heavy.

Teacher Gong Cheng:

The business of Sunac China (1918) in recent years is good because the Chinese property market sings well, but this is not without risk. First of all, if the Chinese property market is reversed, Sunac will have a big blow. In addition, the debt of this stock is extremely high, nothing will be fine, and something big will happen. Therefore, investing in this stock is not impossible, because it is not completely without quality, but you have to understand the risks behind it, and understand that this will make the stock price more volatile, and it is better to control the bet.
3. Steady growth stocks - Henderson
Teacher, I have seen your introduction, I want to add more than one Henderson (0012) into the combination, and grow steadily! After reading your introduction, Henderson has a lot of new territories in Hong Kong. The growth momentum should be good. Do you think there is no problem with monthly supply?

Teacher Gong Cheng:

Henderson (0012) can be added to the portfolio. This stock has a lot of quality assets, such as real estate, and gas (0003). One of the potentials is that Henderson holds a lot of agricultural land in the New Territories. development of. Therefore, you can provide this stock for a long time.
4. Sands does not need to stay in cash to develop?
Hello, Teacher Gong, I would like to ask why Sands paid a dividend of $1.99 per year in the previous year. Earnings per share is only $1.82. Is it not necessary to leave cash for further development? Ask for advice, thank you

Teacher Gong Cheng:

First of all, Sands (1928) has sufficient cash reserves, which makes it have a certain amount of capital dividends. The other biggest factor is its strong cash flow, which exceeds the operating cash flow of $20 billion every year. This makes Sands adequate. The funds go to pay dividends, and at the same time, some funds are going to develop. Sands is in a state of cash flow that is more profitable, reflecting that the company is of a fairly high quality and has enough cash dividends.
5. The choice of interest rate The dividend share VS taxi
Teacher: If the interest-bearing stocks and the taxis are compared, which one is better for collecting interest?

Teacher Gong Cheng:

The interest-bearing stocks will be better. Although the taxi brand has a stable cash flow, most investors invest in taxi licences, which use the borrowing model, which will change the cash flow. At the same time, the price of the taxi card fluctuates greatly and has certain risks. Investing in interest-bearing stocks cannot be concentrated in only one. To establish a portfolio, the risk will be reduced.
