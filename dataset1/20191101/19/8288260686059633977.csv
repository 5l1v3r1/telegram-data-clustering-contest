Aston Villa have confirmed they have reached a settlement with former chief executive Keith Wyness.
Wyness brought a claim against the club and former owner Dr Tony Xia, believing he was unfairly treated in the lead up to his departure.
The former CEO was appointed by Xia in 2016 but was later suspended after falling out with the Chinese businessman.
The suspension was handed to Wyness in 2018 and he later stepped down from his role promising legal action.
Wyness brought a claim involving Villa, one that has now been settled out of court.
Villa confirmed today that they have reached a settlement with the former Everton and Aberdeen executive.
