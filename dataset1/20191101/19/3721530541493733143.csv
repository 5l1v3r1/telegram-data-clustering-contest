Overwatch players got to see the unveiling of Overwatch 2 at BlizzCon 2019, with a new cinematic showing new heroes like Sojourn, and fancy new looks for all of our classic characters from the first game. But this raises an obvious question: what about all of your skins, sprays, victory poses, and play of the game highlights?
All of these things will be coming into Overwatch 2; player progression will be saved, and players will be able to access their entire library of content from Overwatch. That means your holiday skins and special emotes will be accessible from day one.
This transfer between games goes both ways; Overwatch players will get access to all of Overwatch 2’s PVP content for free. Overwatch 2’s new exclusive features seem limited to things like hero missions, story content, and more.
We’ll have more info on Overwatch 2 as BlizzCon 2019 progresses, but we know new heroes will be coming to the game after Sojourn’s introduction.
In short, Overwatch 2 is less like a standalone sequel and more like a giant expansion that builds on the first game. For those who have put a lot of time into Overwatch, they can rest knowing that their skins won’t be lost in the process.
