傳中國駭客入侵電信商監看簡訊 鎖定反中內容
01 Nov 2019, 19:12 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, 中央通訊社
（中央社華盛頓31日綜合外電報導）資安公司「火眼」今天披露，一群中國駭客透過在電信商的伺服器植入監視軟體，攔截內容提到和中國政府立場不同者的簡訊，受害電信商位在「一向是中國戰略對手」的國家。
火眼（FireEye）今天發布報告指出，這群中國駭客屬於駭客團體「ATP（進階持續性威脅，Advanced Persistent Threat）41」，曾從事中國政府指使的間諜行動，且過去10年多數時間從事監視和網路犯罪行為。
報告表示，這群中國駭客發動鎖定目標的攻擊行動，攔截大量外國人的簡訊。部分鎖定對象是「高價值」目標，且全部對象都是依據他們的電話號碼和每支手機獨有的「國際移動用戶辨識碼」（IMSI）挑選。
火眼不願指認受害者和被駭電信商的身分、特徵和所在地點，僅表示駭客使用的間諜軟體專門攔截的簡訊，內容提及與中國政府立場不同的政治領袖、軍事情報組織和政治運動。
火眼的進階攻擊部主管史東（Steven Stone）表示，已知的被攻擊目標並沒有美國政府官員。
火眼將這群駭客使用的惡意軟體稱為「簡訊監聽器」（MESSAGETAP），它能夠在受害者不知情下收集資訊，但無法閱讀透過「端對端加密」（E2EE）應用程式傳送的訊息，例如WhatsApp和iMessage。



史東說：「如果你是被鎖定的目標，並不會知道你的簡訊被攔截，因為你的手機並未被植入惡意軟體。」火眼還說，這群駭客也竊取特定人士的詳細通話紀錄，以取得和這些人有互動的電話號碼、通話長度和通話時間。
火眼指出，APT41今年夏天開始使用「簡訊監聽器」，大約是香港展開反送中抗議運動的同時。火眼說，自從他們發現這起駭客攻擊後，有「數家」電信商遭到惡意軟體鎖定。
火眼並未指明被駭設備的製造商，也未詳細說明駭客如何入侵電信商的網路。
火眼表示，他們觀察到APT41今年鎖定4家電信商，以及部分國家的主要旅遊服務單位和醫療機構。但火眼未指明是哪些國家。
美聯社以電子郵件向華府中國大使館的一名政府代表詢問此事，尚未接獲回應。（譯者：張正芊/核稿：張佑之）1081101
