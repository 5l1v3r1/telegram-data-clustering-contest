The move means that Gordon is now available to other teams on the waiver wire.
The top 10 teams, in order, with priority to claim Gordon are:
1. Miami Dolphins: 0-7
2. Cincinnati Bengals: 0-8
3. Washington Redskins: 1-7
4. Atlanta Falcons: 1-7
5. New York Jets: 1-6
6. New York Giants: 2-6
7. Denver Broncos: 2-6
8. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: 2-5
9. Cleveland Browns: 2-5
10. Los Angeles Chargers: 3-5
Gordon, 28, has been dealing with two bone bruises in his left knee, and he last played for New England on Oct. 10 against the New York Giants.
The Patriots recently acquired receiver Mohamed Sanu from the Atlanta Falcons, a transaction that appeared to signal Gordon’s status was shaky.
Gordon had 20 receptions for 287 yards and one touchdown in six games this season. He played in 17 games for New England over the past two seasons and had 60 catches for 1,007 yards and four scores.
Overall, Gordon has 240 career catches for 4,113 yards and 20 touchdowns in 58 NFL games, the first 41 with the Cleveland Browns. He was an All-Pro after the 2013 season, when he led the league in receiving yards (1,646).
