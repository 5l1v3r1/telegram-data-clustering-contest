新警察总长伊丹姆中将 祝执行任务顺利！

01 Nov 2019, 03:05

我国警察即将由伊丹姆（Idham Aziz）中将领导，他是一名经验丰富、成就斐然的高级警官。希望我国警察从此更加团结一心，能够提高对民众的服务质量。国会第三委员会以鼓掌欢呼方式批准了佐科威总统提名的伊丹姆，没有任何派系拒绝伊丹姆，下一个进程将由国会全体会议商定。伊丹姆接替已担任内政部长的狄托（Tito Karnavian）成为警察总长。接受资格考核之后，伊丹姆立即签署了廉正协议。他引用了前总统哈比比（BJ Habibie）的睿智言辞：”我不会问真主为什么，什么原因和该怎么做。但如果允许我提出要求，那么请给我指引和力量，让我按照您的旨意走在正确的道路上。”伊丹姆1963年出生于苏拉威西东南部的肯达里（Kendari）市，1988年毕业于警察学院，曾长期与狄托共事。例如，在巴厘岛成功打击炸弹恐怖分子的行动，以及2005年11月9日在东爪哇巴图（Batu）市击垮 Azahari 博士和其同伙。由于这些成就，伊丹姆和狄托获得了时任警察总长Sutanto的奖励。两人还参与对前总统苏哈多的小儿子汤米（Tommy Soeharto）的追捕，汤米曾参与谋杀首席大法官Syafiuddin Kartasasmita。通过狄托领导的眼镜蛇小组，警方最终逮捕了汤米，汤米必须对自己的罪行负责，在Nusakambangan岛上服刑。有许多记录表明，伊丹姆在铲除恐怖主义和社会及人道主义犯罪方面均有出色表现。伊丹姆还参与了国军开展的Maleo Camar行动，并于2015年初在中苏拉威西波索（Poso）山区成功抓获恐怖组织头目Santoso。在2018年亚运会国际赛事期间，伊丹姆被认为成功在雅加达维持公共安全和秩序方面的有利局势。因此，伊丹姆被认为是适合取代狄托的人物，并有望保持和提高其前任者取得的成就。伊丹姆在其后的领导期间有七个优先计划，包括发展人力资源、巩固公共安全和秩序、加强专业公正执法、加强媒体管理、加强警察协同作用、机构建设和强化监督尽管近年来警察的形象和声誉有所提高，但伊丹姆面临的挑战一点都不少。警察至今还没有侦破民众关注的几起案件，逮捕其作案者追究责任。在过去的几年中，我们目睹了导致人命伤亡的各种暴力事件，例如5月21日和22日的示威，以及不久前总统宣誓就职前的大学生示威等。伊丹姆还必须能够完成对肃贪会（KPK）高级调查员Novel Baswedan 被泼镪水案件的调查，对此案的调查直到现在还没有明确的结果。无论有什么背景，这起案件已经成为我国民众关注的焦点，并成为我国执法上的污点。我们还需要提醒佐科威总统让警方摒弃腐败文化的要求。在雅加达史耐延举行的第72届Bhayangkara日仪式的与会者面前，总统还指示警察领导人改善执法方面的内部弱点，并在处理社会问题时首重预防和人道主义措施。现在的情况已经改变了很多。警察前总长狄托上将曾经提到，一项全球法律和秩序调查研究的结果显示，我国是世界上排名第9的最安全国家。狄托说：“这个位置高于丹麦（第10位）和荷兰（第15位），甚至高于排在第27位的日本。”然而我们要强调，警察不可自满，须知今后将有许多越来越困难和棘手的任务。随着世界的不断变化和发展，人民对警察的要求和希望也越来越大，但愿作为新警察总长的伊丹姆能够提高其机构为民众提供服务的质量水平，而不是提升自己的实力和权力。

Lieutenant General Idum, the new chief of police, wishes the mission to go smoothly!

01 Nov 2019, 03:05

Our police will be headed by Lieutenant General Idham Aziz, an experienced and accomplished senior police officer. I hope that our police will be more united and able to improve the quality of service to the people. The Third Committee of the National Assembly approved Idim, nominated by President Zucker, by applause. No party refused to Admiral, and the next process will be agreed by the plenary session of the National Assembly. Itam replaced the Tito Karnavian, who has served as the Minister of the Interior, as the Chief of Police. After accepting the qualification assessment, Itham immediately signed the integrity agreement. He quoted the wise words of former President BJ Habibie: ""I will not ask why Allah, what reason and what to do. But if you allow me to ask, please give me guidance and strength, let me follow your The purpose is to go on the right path."" Idham was born in Kendari, southeast of Sulawesi in 1963. He graduated from the Police Academy in 1988 and worked with Dito for a long time. For example, the successful fight against bomb terrorists in Bali and the killing of Dr. Azahari and his associates in Batu, East Java, on November 9, 2005. As a result of these achievements, Idom and Dito received the award from the then Chief of Police, Sutanto. The two also participated in the pursuit of former president Suharto's young son Tommy Soeharto, who was involved in the murder of Chief Justice Syafiuddin Kartasasmita. Through the Cobra team led by Dito, the police finally arrested Tommy, who must be responsible for his crimes and serve his sentence on Nusakambangan Island. There are many records showing that Iraq has performed well in eradicating terrorism and social and humanitarian crime. Itham also participated in the Maleo Camar operation of the National Army and successfully captured the terrorist organization leader Santoso in the Poso mountainous region of Central Sulaw in early 2015. During the 2018 Asian Games international competition, Idum was considered a successful situation in maintaining public safety and order in Jakarta. Therefore, Idum is considered to be a suitable person to replace Dito and is expected to maintain and improve the achievements of his predecessors. During his subsequent leadership, Idum had seven priority programs, including developing human resources, consolidating public safety and order, strengthening professional and impartial law enforcement, strengthening media management, strengthening police synergies, building institutions and strengthening oversight despite the image of the police in recent years. And the reputation has improved, but the challenges facing Itam are quite a bit. The police have yet to detect several cases of public concern and arrest their perpetrators for accountability. In the past few years, we have witnessed various violent incidents that have led to casualties, such as demonstrations on May 21 and 22, and college student demonstrations just before the president was sworn in. Itham must also be able to complete a survey of the case of the Spike Water, a senior investigator of the KPK, and the investigation of the case has not yet been clear. Regardless of the background, this case has become the focus of attention of the Chinese people and has become a stain on law enforcement in our country. We also need to remind President Zuckwey to let the police abandon the demands of a culture of corruption. In front of the participants of the 72nd Bhayangkara Day Ceremony in Schneider, Jakarta, the President also instructed police leaders to improve internal weaknesses in law enforcement and to take the first preventive and humanitarian measures in dealing with social issues. The situation has changed a lot now. Admiral Dito, the former chief of the police, once mentioned that the results of a global law and order investigation show that China is the ninth safest country in the world. Dito said: ""This position is higher than Denmark (10th) and the Netherlands (15th), even higher than Japan ranked 27th."" However, we must emphasize that the police are not complacent, and that there will be many more in the future. The more difficult and tricky the task is. As the world continues to change and develop, the people’s demands and hopes for the police are also growing. I hope that as the new police chief, Idham can improve the quality of the services provided by his institutions, instead of improving their own strength and that power.
