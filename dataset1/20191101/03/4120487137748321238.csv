【海外网】近日，英国国家经济和社会研究所（NEESR）发布一份报告，报告称英国首相鲍里斯约翰逊的“脱欧”协议将使英国每年额外花费700亿英镑（约合6400亿人民币），平均下来每位英国公民年损失约为1100英镑（约合人民币10010元）。据俄罗斯卫星通讯社31日报道，英国国家经济和社会研究所首席经济学家阿诺汉茨切表示：“我们预估，由于脱离欧盟和欧洲单一市场厖从长远来看，对英国GDP的影响将是大约3%到4%，相当于700亿英镑。”汉茨切称，这些损失相当于威尔士的年产总值，也相当于每个英国公民每年将损失1100英镑。此外，随着英国退出欧盟和单一市场，双边贸易预计将下降40%，服务贸易预计将下降60%。预计净移民人数每年将减少5万人。

According to a report by the Russian Satellite News Agency on the 31st, the Asian National Institute of Economic and Social Research, the chief economist of the United Kingdom, said: ""We estimate that due to the long-term separation from the EU and the European single market, the impact on the UK's GDP will be It's about 3% to 4%, which is equivalent to 70 billion pounds.” Hantzche said that these losses are equivalent to the total annual output of Wales, which is equivalent to a loss of £1,100 per British citizen per year. In addition, as the UK exits the EU and the single market, bilateral trade is expected to fall by 40% and service trade is expected to fall by 60%. The number of net immigrants is expected to decrease by 50,000 per year.
