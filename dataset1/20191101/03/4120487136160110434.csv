01 Nov 2019, 03:30

【汇通网】几十年来，美元一直是世界上主要的储备货币，但全球安全分析研究所的安妮科林警告称，随着俄罗斯、欧盟等试图削弱美元的重要性，美元的地位可能会受到威胁。能源与安全智库联合主管科林周三表示，俄罗斯和欧盟等“主要国家”有强烈的、明确的“去美元化动机。我们不知道接下来会发生什么，但我们知道目前的情况是不可持续的。其中一个促使他们远离美元的原因是，如果他们以美元进行交易，可能会受到美国的管辖。当使用美元或通过美国银行清算交易时，实体受到该国的管辖，即使它们与美国无关。因此，许多国家有“非常、非常强烈的动机”放弃使用美元。此前，俄罗斯最大的石油公司俄罗斯石油公司表示，该公司的出口合同不再使用美元，而转为使用欧元结算。俄罗斯石油公司总裁伊戈尔谢钦在欧亚经济论坛上表示，目前俄罗斯石油公司所有的出口合同已经全部实现欧元结算，欧元结算的潜力是非常巨大的。他还指出，如今的贸易摩擦和制裁对抗的加剧使得世界经济市场正面临新的风险。俄罗斯石油公司总裁 伊戈尔谢钦称，如今世界上不断加剧的贸易问题和制裁对抗正在摧毁已经建立起来的经济联系。当世界贸易不仅受制于政治周期，甚至受制于选举周期时 ，新的风险就会显现。专家分析称，俄罗斯石油公司出口合同转由欧元结算的主要原因可能是担心美国制裁，同时也是为了降低购买石油的欧洲国家的交易风险。分析认为，虽然俄罗斯石油公司很难通过汇差取得高收益，但是从长远来看，这一举措将会取得显著成效。因为这将促使其他的俄罗斯石油出口商也从美元结算转由欧元或是其他货币进行结算。此外，据俄罗斯媒体报道称，俄罗斯、中国和印度已开发出一种可在SWIFT结算系统断连的情况下接替运作的电子结算方式，与此同时，欧亚经济联盟也正在制定一个无美元支付体系的共同制度，它与包括中国和伊朗在内的一系列合作伙伴签订了贸易协定，正在通过任何必要的投资和结算机制以绕开美元，中国、俄罗斯、伊朗和土耳其是欧亚经济一体化的四个关键载体，稍早前，据伊朗工商业矿业和农业商会透露，昆仑银行已宣布，它将在今年12月底前继续与伊朗进行银行交易，并仅使用人民币进行金融交易结算。

[Huitong.com] For decades, the US dollar has been the world's major reserve currency, but Anne Colin of the Global Security Analysis Institute warned that as Russia, the European Union, etc. try to weaken the importance of the dollar, the status of the dollar may be affected. Threat. Colin, co-director of the Energy and Security Think Tank, said on Wednesday that “major countries” such as Russia and the EU have a strong and clear “de-dollar motive. We don’t know what will happen next, but we know that the current situation is unsustainable. One of the reasons for driving them away from the US dollar is that if they trade in US dollars, they may be subject to US jurisdiction. When using US dollars or clearing transactions through US banks, entities are subject to the jurisdiction of the country, even if they are not related to the United States. Many countries have ""very, very strong motives"" to abandon the use of the US dollar. Previously, Russia's largest oil company, Russian oil company, said that the company's export contract no longer uses the US dollar, but switched to use the euro settlement. Russian oil company president Yi Gorchechin said at the Eurasian Economic Forum that the current export contracts of Russian oil companies have all achieved euro settlement, and the potential for euro settlement is very huge. He also pointed out that today’s trade friction and sanctions have intensified the world. The economic market is facing new risks. Ross Oil Company President Igor Shechin said that today's growing trade problems and sanctions in the world are destroying the established economic ties. When world trade is not only subject to the political cycle, but even subject to the electoral cycle, new risks It will appear. Experts say that the main reason for the transfer of Russian oil company export contracts to the euro may be due to US sanctions, but also to reduce the trading risks of European countries that purchase oil. The analysis believes that although it is difficult for Russian oil companies to The difference is high, but in the long run, this move will achieve significant results, as it will prompt other Russian oil exporters to switch from US dollar settlement to Euro or other currencies. In addition, according to Russian media reports It is said that Russia, China and India have developed an electronic settlement method that can take over the operation of the SWIFT settlement system. At the same time, the Eurasian Economic Union is also developing a common system without a dollar payment system. With a series of projects including China and Iran The partners signed a trade agreement and are bypassing the US dollar through any necessary investment and settlement mechanisms. China, Russia, Iran and Turkey are the four key carriers of Eurasian economic integration. Earlier, according to the Iranian Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mining and Agriculture It is revealed that Kunlun Bank has announced that it will continue to conduct banking transactions with Iran before the end of December this year and use only RMB for financial transaction settlement.
