【点滴网雅加达10月31日讯】2019年第三季度在我国的投资落实录得为205.7兆盾，比去年同期的173.8兆盾上升18.4%。这是投资统筹机构(BKPM)投资实施控制部门暂摄助理Farah Ratnadewi Indriani于周四，在雅加达投资统筹机构办公室的新闻发布会上透露的。该2019年第三季度的投资落实若与上月的200.5兆盾相比的话则微升2.6%。她说，“第三季度比去年同期有所上升18.4%，和比2019年第二季度提高 2.6%。”如果在1月至9月期间计算的话，则2019年的投资值为601.3兆盾，仍然比去年同期的535.4兆盾更高。Farah说，“1月至9月已经达到了，我们可以看到的总数据达601.3兆盾。”外国投资(PMA)仍然主导着上述成就，其数额为105兆盾。而剩下的国内投资(PMDN)为100.7兆盾。与此同时，在这美国经济增长放缓之际，美国中央银行或美联储(The Fed)下调其基准利率25个基点(bps)。该降息是今年内的第三次。财政部长丝莉.慕利亚妮(Sri Mulyani Indrawati)称，美联储的降幅是前段时间美国中央银行基准利率上升的影响。以致当时利率上升的状况，促使许多新兴国家不得不面对其后果。周四，她在雅加达说，“因此该降息给了我们包括我国在内的空间，可利用这种契机来提高经济活动。”丝莉.慕利亚妮认为，在投资方面，该降息也是一件好事，将提高我国的投资。因为藉着降息意味着它的资金成本也就变得更低。(xin)

[Drip Network Jakarta October 31st] In the third quarter of 2019, the investment implementation in China recorded 205.7 trillion rupiah, up 18.4% from 173.8 trillion rupiah in the same period last year. This is the investment coordinator of the Investment Coordinator (BKPM), the temporary assistant to the investment control department, Farah Ratnadewi Indriani, revealed at a press conference at the office of the Investment Coordinator in Jakarta on Thursday. The investment in the third quarter of 2019 increased slightly by 2.6% compared with the previous month's 200.5 trillion rupiah. She said, “The third quarter increased by 18.4% compared with the same period of last year, and by 2.6% compared with the second quarter of 2019.” If calculated from January to September, the investment value for 2019 is 601.3 trillion. Still higher than the 535.4 trillion rupiah of the same period last year. Farah said, ""January to September has been reached, we can see a total of 601.3 trillion rupiah."" Foreign investment (PMA) still dominates the above achievements, the amount of 105 trillion. The remaining domestic investment (PMDN) is 100.7 trillion. At the same time, the US central bank or the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points (bps) as the US economy slowed. The rate cut is the third time this year. Treasury Secretary Sri Mulyani Indrawati said the Fed's decline was due to the rise in the benchmark interest rate of the US central bank some time ago. As a result, the rise in interest rates at the time prompted many emerging countries to face the consequences. On Thursday, she said in Jakarta, “So the rate cuts have given us space, including ours, and we can use this opportunity to improve economic activity.” Silly Mulani believes that in terms of investment, the rate cut is also a A good thing will increase our investment. Because by cutting interest rates, it means that its capital cost will become lower. (xin)
