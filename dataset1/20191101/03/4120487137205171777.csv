德国10月失业人数环比上升

01 Nov 2019, 03:29

【新华财经柏林讯】德国联邦劳工局周三公布的数据显示，经季节调整后，10月份德国失业人数为228.7万人，比9月份增加6000人；当月失业率为5.0%，与此前5个月的失业率持平。德国联邦劳工局局长德特勒夫舍勒在当天的声明中说，当前疲软的经济无疑在劳动力市场留下了印记，但总体而言，劳动力市场依然保持强劲。德国经济研究所高级经济学家霍尔格舍费尔对新华社记者表示，失业人数仍保持稳定，但经济放缓的影响在劳动力市场上变得越来越显著。今年第二季度，德国经济环比萎缩0.1%。德国央行此前发布报告说，第三季度经济可能再度萎缩。德国联邦经济和能源部日前发布经济预测报告，将今年德国国内生产总值(GDP)增速预期维持在0.5%不变，但将明年经济增速从此前预测的1.5%下调至1.0%。这意味着今明两年德国经济增速均将远低于去年的1.8%。

German unemployment in October rose from the previous month

01 Nov 2019, 03:29

[Xinhua Finance News] The data released by the German Federal Labor Office on Wednesday showed that after seasonal adjustment, the number of unemployed in Germany was 2.287 million in October, an increase of 6,000 from September; the unemployment rate in the month was 5.0%, compared with the previous five months. The unemployment rate is flat. German Federal Labor Director Detlef Scheler said in a statement that day that the current weak economy has undoubtedly left a mark on the labor market, but overall, the labor market remains strong. Holger Schaefer, a senior economist at the German Economic Research Institute, told Xinhua that the number of unemployed people remained stable, but the impact of the economic slowdown has become more and more prominent in the labor market. In the second quarter of this year, the German economy contracted by 0.1%. The Bundesbank has previously released a report saying that the economy may shrink again in the third quarter. The German Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy recently released an economic forecast report to maintain Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate unchanged at 0.5% this year, but will reduce its economic growth rate from the previous forecast of 1.5% to 1.0% next year. This means that Germany's economic growth rate will be much lower than last year's 1.8%.
