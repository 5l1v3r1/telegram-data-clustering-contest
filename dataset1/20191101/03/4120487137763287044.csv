【海外网】英国下院议长约翰伯考因多次在议会上大喊“Order”（秩序）控制场面走红，在这位“网红”议长即将卸任之际，英国首相约翰逊不忘调侃他一番。据英国《太阳报》报道，当地时间30日，约翰伯考最后一次主持英国议会的首相质询环节。英国首相约翰逊当天首先向伯考表达了敬意，随后调侃道，伯考“就像不受控制的网球发球机一样”，在议会上发表自己的观点。他还称，伯考是“自史蒂芬霍金之后最会控制时间的人”。最后，约翰逊还是感谢了考伯为议会的作出的贡献，称其是“议会的伟大公仆”。对于首相的调侃，伯考显然并未放在心上，一笑置之。英国《地铁报》报道称，工党领袖科尔宾等议会成员当天也对伯考表示感谢，肯定了他在担任议长十年间的付出。在议会结束时，伯考对议员们的赞美以及家人的支持表达了感谢，“我永远不会忘记，永远感激。”

[Overseas] The British House of Commons Speaker John Bokow has screamed ""Order"" in the parliament for many times. When the ""Net Red"" Speaker is about to step down, British Prime Minister Johnson will not forget to ridicule him. . According to the British ""Sun"" report, on the 30th local time, John Bokow last time hosted the Prime Minister's inquiry session of the British Parliament. British Prime Minister Johnson first paid tribute to Berkau on the same day, and then ridiculed that Boko ""like an uncontrolled tennis ball machine"" and expressed his views in the parliament. He also said that Boko is ""the person who will control the time since Stephen Hawking"". Finally, Johnson thanked Cobb for his contribution to the parliament, calling it ""the great public servant of the parliament."" For the investigation of the Prime Minister, Bokoo apparently did not put it in his heart, laughing at it. The British ""Medical News"" reported that the Labour Party leader Corbin and other members of the parliament expressed their gratitude to Boko on the same day, affirming his contribution to the parliament for ten years. At the end of the parliament, Boko expressed his gratitude to the parliamentarians for their praise and support from the family. ""I will never forget, I am forever grateful.""
