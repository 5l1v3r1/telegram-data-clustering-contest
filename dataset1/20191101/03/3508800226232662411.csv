厭倦了走馬看花的奔波，給自己一趟真正理想的旅行
01 Nov 2019, 03:28 by 廣編企劃


我們想讓你知道的是旅行的樣貌很多種，其中最迷人之處便是身處異地所感受到的一切不同，巧妙的轉化了心情，也補充了全新的能量。過去，在行程安排中總是擔任工具性角色的旅館，如今已經成為旅程的亮點。






旅行，除了讓人摒息的風景、難忘的風土民情，最讓人久久不能忘懷的是旅程中的愉快與愜意，而那份縈繞於心不會散去的美好感受，正是旅行帶給你的珍貴禮物。因此，愈來愈多人嚮往深度旅行，捨棄景點的追逐，有時間便長駐，時間不夠的話用雙腳與五官，放慢腳步體驗異國城市裡的獨特氛圍。近來，在許多旅者間口耳相傳的旅行，不是哪個知名城市，不是哪個罕見行程，而是將旅館當成景點之一的名旅館之旅。
旅宿，才是深刻領略旅行的所在
在日本，除了有專家背書的百選旅館，還有更勝一籌的「名旅館」。這些究極旅宿，多半位在大自然的秘境中，沒有車水馬龍的喧囂，房間數極少，就連日本國人也很難訂到。這些名旅館本身對建築與空間的追求，也都各自有獨到之處。在南九州，擁有萬坪佔地的「石原莊」，卻只打造15間客房。目的無他，就是為了讓住客好好享受天降川的溪谷美景，細細感受與自然合一的溫泉體驗。此外，也有以現代極簡風為主，使用竹子、水與玻璃三種元素，營造了白天晚上不同氣氛，輕巧且空靈的宮崎「GARDEN TERRACE」是讓人驚豔的經典。嚮往日本幕府時代風情的旅人，更別錯過造訪「白水館」，在濃濃的江戶風情中，飽覽錦江灣的無名海景，體驗天然砂蒸溫泉，成為住客的那一刻起，五萬坪的松林庭園隨你漫遊，寬敞舒適的空間、穩定靜謐的氣味，讓心情也跟著放鬆、開闊起來。

慢旅，才是最棒的旅行方式
這些傳遞著旅館主人的理想與堅持、尊重自然環境，有些更是擁有悠久歷史的旅館，早已跳脫旅館只是提供一夜住宿的陳舊觀念。在懂得旅行的人心中，這些名旅館值得讓人拋開一個又一個的景點，把時間讓出來，把自己留在名旅館內享受，這才是旅行的真意。除了感受空間，這些名旅館也都有著讓人折服的美食，鮮美的海鮮、老饕口中的頂級鐵板燒、呼應時令的講究和食，一間好的旅館，能讓遠道而來的人，不只是旅客，而是尊貴的座上賓，因為每個細節都是款待的心意。

南九州，就是這樣一個擁有豐厚歷史底蘊，也有著依山傍海絕美景致的地方，這裡的名旅館更是讓人眼睛一亮，值得特別為此安排一趟旅行，而且把大部分的時間留給這些名旅館。得到2018金旅獎的「南九州秘湯隱宿名旅館悠遊5天」行程，便是以此為出發點，10人的小團體，沒有過多景點的安排，搭乘直飛鹿兒島的航班，一切只為了讓旅人有充分的時間可以好好欣賞名旅館的風采。
即刻給自己一趟真正的旅行
如果你正想著安排一趟旅行，而且是有別於以往的旅行。厭倦了走馬看花的奔波，自行規劃又會在行前耗費心神，旅行的樂趣可能都先消磨耗損了，不如就選擇以名旅館為主的行程。從鄰近的日本開始，走訪環海的南九州，或是位於日本國土中央的山陰地區，山海大景兼具的伊豆半島、北陸立山、輕井澤、京都、四國、新潟⋯⋯等等，讓一間間充滿內涵以及設計名旅館，成為你旅行中最重要的回憶；也讓你的旅行從此升級，成為真正能從旅行中獲得收穫，並且得到力量的旅者。
