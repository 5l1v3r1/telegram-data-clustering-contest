01 Nov 2019, 03:39

【海外网】当地时间30日，美国国防部公布了突袭极端组织“伊斯兰国”（IS）首领巴格达迪（Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi）行动的首批视频和照片。据美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）、《赫芬顿邮报》等媒体报道，美国中央司令部战斗司令麦肯齐（Frank McKenzie）30日在五角大楼举行的简报会上，公布了美军袭击巴格达迪的部分经解密的视频和照片。视频显示，美军对巴格达迪住所附近进行了长达两个小时的袭击。在逼近巴格达迪住所时，美军F-15战机和MQ-9“收割者”无人机发动了空袭。根据麦肯齐介绍，在巴格达迪住处附近，有两处武装分子向参与袭击的美军机开火。美军捉拿巴格达迪前，对方引爆炸药背心后身亡，同时导致两名儿童死亡。巴格达迪自杀后，美军进行DNA测试，与2004年巴格达迪在伊拉克被扣押期间所获取的样本比对后，确认了身份。巴格达迪死后24小时内，美军根据武装冲突法以海葬形式处理巴格达迪的遗体。麦肯齐同时强调，他无法证实巴格达迪在生命最后一刻，是否像美国总统特朗普日前在电视讲话中形容地那样“尖叫痛哭”。
