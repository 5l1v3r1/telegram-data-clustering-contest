四中全會為何不見接班人？專家揭內幕

01 Nov 2019, 03:06

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】中共十九屆四中全會10月31日落幕後，全會公報出爐。但並沒出現外界關注的有關增補兩名中共政治局常委，或確定習近平接班人的內容。對此，有專家披露，全會表面上看起來風平浪靜，但背後暗流洶湧。
為期4天的中共十九屆四中全會結束。中共官方公布的全會公報的相關人事信息中，只是進行了中央委員遞補：遞補中國融通總經理馬正武、海軍工程大學馬偉明為中央委員。這是中共十九大後首次遞補中央委員。
同時，全會審議並通過了中紀委關於前證監會主席劉士余「嚴重違紀違法」問題的審查報告，確認中央政治局之前作出的給予劉士餘留黨察看二年的處分。
未能參加會議的2名中央委員，除了劉士余，另一人應是去年10月20日跳樓死亡的澳門中聯辦主任鄭曉松。至於未出席會議的3名候補中央委員，就暫未知是誰。
這次會議公報其它內容並無新意。至於四中全會前，廣泛流傳的增補兩名中共政治局常委，或確定習近平的接班人的消息也沒出現。
時政評論員石實對大紀元分析說，有關人事調整的消息，應該是習近平的政敵向外放的風，目的是藉助當前中國經濟嚴重惡化、美中貿易戰仍在持續、香港反送中亂局向習近平施壓，讓習早點離任下台。
他說，中共四中全會表面看風平浪靜，但背後卻暗流洶湧，權斗不止，反習勢力一直虎視眈眈，想藉各種機會向大權獨攬的習近平施壓。
法廣10月31日刊文說，習近平治下接班人的問題，總會在某種時機出現並引起關心，這是因為一天沒有接班人，中共內部不放心，如果是有人在放風，那又是為了誰的利益？故此四中全會前這股風很詭異。因為全會公報中，不可能留下有關這方面的痕跡，中共黑箱政治之下，有關接班人問題，還不知道要封鎖多久，但現實卻不能再捂了。
文章引用旅美中國學者吳祚來說法稱，許多人討論中共繼承人問題，並不是關心中共或習共，而是一種焦慮，因為中國是人治，下一任決定中國的黑暗度，或黑暗持續度。

習近平頭5年執政，全力抓權，中共十九大，廢除中共隔代指定接班人的家規。2018年1至2月，接連召開二中、三中全會。確定了「習思想」，並將「習思想」寫入其黨章，提出修改中共憲法，取消中共國家主席、副主席的任期限制。
同年3月的中共兩會上，「習思想」被寫入中共憲法，中共國家主席、副主席的任期限制被取消。習近平的權力達到高峰，為自己終身執政鋪平了道路。
2018年3月川普總統發動貿易戰，習近平的絕對權力開始逆轉，貿易戰令中共陷入經濟困境下，今年6月香港爆發反送中抗爭，美國推出「香港人權及民主法案」。
四中全會召開前，港台媒體紛紛報導，姍姍來遲的本次全會上，習近平的接班人可能露面，並點名可能是59歲的陳敏爾和56歲的中共國務院副總理胡春華，認為二人先晉升政治局常委再向未來的接班人角色過渡。
路透社則引述中共外交官和領導層官員的消息說，外界猜測有幾個中共官員有望接替習近平：包括陳敏爾、60歲的上海市委書記李強和63歲的廣東省委書記李希。
但當時石實分析說，習近平應該不會在本次全會上確立接班人。因為習近平如果不想在二十大上連任，他沒必要冒天下之大不韙而取消主席任期限制。
阿波羅網特約評論員王篤然當時也分析說，四中全會前，有關接班人和常委7變9等等消息，很可能是反習派政治上的造勢，來凸顯習近平已經勢弱，為反習勢力打氣。
時政評論家、哥倫比亞大學政治學博士李天笑刊文說，最近由江派常委韓正出面借新加坡副總理到重慶，暗提陳敏爾將成為接班人問題，實際是江派的一個陰謀。
該陰謀估計有多重目的：一是，害怕習下重手在四中全會期間拿下江派「大老虎」，韓正被迫假意輸誠討好。二是，挑撥陳敏爾與習近平的關係；三是，用接班人問題影射習取消任期限制問題，對習再度「高級黑」。
分析人士認為，處於70年大限的中共專制制度，面臨美中貿易戰及香港反送中等等諸多棘手事件，很有可能在激烈內鬥中走向解體，當年蘇聯的崩潰幾乎是出乎全世界專家的預料。

Why did the Fourth Plenary Session not see the successor? Experts reveal the inside story

01 Nov 2019, 03:06

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 01, 2019] After the fall of the 19th Central Committee of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the plenary session was released. However, there has not been any concern about the addition of two members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party or the determination of Xi Jinping’s successor. In response to this, some experts have revealed that the plenary seems to be calm and calm, but behind it.
The four-day ruling of the 19th CPC Central Committee ended. Among the relevant personnel information published by the CCP in the plenary bulletin, only the Central Committee member has been added: Mr. Ma Zhengwu, General Manager of China Rongtong, and Ma Weiming, Naval Engineering University, as members of the Central Committee. This is the first time to replenish the Central Committee members after the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
At the same time, the Plenary Session reviewed and approved the review report of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection on Liu Shiyu, the former chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, on the issue of “serious violation of laws and regulations”, confirming the punishment given by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee to Liu Shiyu to stay in the party for two years.
The two central committee members who failed to attend the meeting, apart from Liu Shiyu, the other person should be Zheng Xiaosong, director of the Macao Liaison Office who died on October 20 last year. As for the three alternate Central Committee members who did not attend the meeting, they are temporarily unknown.
The rest of the communique of this meeting is not new. As for the Fourth Plenary Session, the widespread circulation of two members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo, or the confirmation of Xi Jinping’s successor, did not appear.
Shi Zheng, a political commentator, said that the news about personnel adjustment should be the wind of Xi Jinping’s political enemies. The purpose is to use the current serious deterioration of the Chinese economy, the US-China trade war is still going on, and Hong Kong’s anti-delivery The bureau put pressure on Xi Jinping, letting Xi leave the post early.
He said that the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party looked calm and calm, but behind it was undercurrent and power struggled. The anti-experience forces have been eagerly eyeing and wanted to use various opportunities to exert pressure on Xi Jinping, who is monopolized.
On October 31, Faguang said that the problem of Xi Jinping’s successor will always arise at a certain time and cause concern. This is because there is no successor in one day, and the CCP is not at ease. If someone is releasing the wind, then For whose benefit? Therefore, this trend before the Fourth Plenary Session was very strange. Because in the plenary bulletin, it is impossible to leave traces about this aspect. Under the black box politics of the CCP, the issue of successors still does not know how long it will be blocked, but the reality can no longer be embarrassed.
The article quotes Wu Xi, a Chinese scholar from the United States, as saying that many people discuss the issue of the CCP's heirs. They are not concerned about the CCP or the CCP, but an anxiety. Because China is a rule of man, the next one determines China's darkness or darkness.

Xi Jinping took power in the first five years and fully seized power. The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China abolished the rules of the CCP's designated successors. From January to February 2018, the Second and Third Plenary Sessions were held one after another. The ""study thoughts"" were determined, and the ""study thoughts"" were written into their party constitutions, and the revision of the CCP constitution was proposed to abolish the term limits of the presidents and vice-chairmen of the Chinese Communist Party.
At the two sessions of the Chinese Communist Party in March of the same year, the ""study thoughts"" were written into the Constitution of the Chinese Communist Party, and the term limits of the presidents and vice-chairmen of the Chinese Communist Party were abolished. Xi Jinping’s power reached its peak and paved the way for his lifelong rule.
In March 2018, President Trump launched a trade war, and Xi Jinping’s absolute power began to reverse. The trade war ordered the Chinese Communist Party to fall into economic difficulties. In June this year, Hong Kong broke out in the anti-delivery campaign, and the United States launched the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.
Before the Fourth Plenary Session, Hong Kong and Taiwan media reported that at the late plenary meeting, Xi Jinping’s successor may appear, and may be named 59-year-old Chen Miner and 56-year-old Vice Premier of the State Council Hu Chunhua. It is believed that the two will be promoted to the Politburo Standing Committee and then transition to the future successor role.
Reuters quoted Chinese diplomats and leadership officials as saying that there are several CCP officials who are expected to succeed Xi Jinping: including Chen Miner, 60-year-old Shanghai Party Secretary Li Qiang and 63-year-old Guangdong Provincial Party Secretary Li Xi.
However, Shi Shi analysis said that Xi Jinping should not establish a successor at this plenary meeting. Because Xi Jinping does not want to be re-elected at the 20th National Congress, he does not need to take the world's big deal and cancel the president's term limit.
Wang Luran, a special commentator of Apollo, also analyzed at the time that before the Fourth Plenary Session, the news about the successor and the Standing Committee 7 changed to 9 and so on, it is likely that the anti-study political momentum has highlighted that Xi Jinping has become weak and is a counter-industry. Pump up.
Li Zhengxiao, a political critic and a doctor of political science at Columbia University, said that recently, Jiang Zheng’s Standing Committee member Han Zheng came forward to borrow the Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister to Chongqing, secretly mentioning that Chen Miner will become a successor. Actually, it is a conspiracy of the Jiang faction.
The conspiracy is estimated to have multiple purposes: First, fear of the heavy hand to win the Jiangpai ""big tiger"" during the Fourth Plenary Session, Han Zheng was forced to plead guilty. The second is to provoke Chen Miner's relationship with Xi Jinping; the third is to use the successor problem to cancel the term limit issue and re-study the ""advanced black"".
Analysts believe that the CCP's autocratic system, which is in the 70-year limit, faces many thorny events, such as the US-China trade war and Hong Kong's anti-delivery. It is likely to break down in the fierce struggle. The collapse of the Soviet Union was almost out of the world. Expected.
