台灣惠普前董座黃河明辭世　魏應充悼念「悲痛不捨」
01 Nov 2019, 03:57 by 葉文全
前台灣惠普（HP）公司董事長、前資策會董事長黃河明驚傳墜樓不治消息，頂新集團三董魏應充在得知消息後，也在臉書「來自永靖的老園丁-魏應充」粉絲專頁發文表達哀悼之意，並且期望能持續推廣黃河明遺志，讓善愛精神長存。
黃河明最為人所熟知的，就是帶領台灣惠普公司營業額大幅成長，專長於跨國經營管理、國際品牌行銷；而因為他的表哥是脊髓損傷的病友，因此他投入病友團體的公益事業不遺餘力，這也成為他跟魏應充相識的因緣。
魏應充說道，「黃董事長是與我志同道合的良師益友，我早已久仰他在經營管理的長才，但真正有機會與他結緣，是因為他長年投入脊髓損傷病友的關懷，我非常感佩黃董事長的奉獻，也因此曾捐助脊髓損傷協會，協助他推動病友們就業自立。」
後來魏應充因為他所支持成立的好食好事基金會推動第一屆「好食好事加速器計畫」需要各領域業師一起協助年輕人投入食農領域的科技創新發展，因此邀請黃河明一起義務幫忙，黃河明也義不容辭答應，魏應充說，「這份情誼我至今感念於心，也一直期盼能與他有更多的合作，沒想到今日竟然接獲令人遺憾的消息。」

魏應充文中特別感謝黃河明一生無私付出，也表示期望未來能將他的遺志持續推廣下去，讓這份善愛的精神長存。
