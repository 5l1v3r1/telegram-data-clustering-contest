【海外网】因坠机风波而受到打击的美国波音公司日前又面临新的安全隐患。据外媒报道，在波音承认正在全球范围内对其飞机进行检查后，已有多达50架737NG飞机因出现裂缝被停飞。综合法新社及路透社报道，波音公司的一位发言人31日表示，到目前为止，全球约有1000架飞机“达到了检查阈值”，其中不到5％的飞机（或多达50架飞机）的“检查情况”迫使飞机一直停飞，需要进行维修。据悉，波音737NG是737系列飞机的第3代机型。美国联邦航空总署此前曾通知美国各航空公司检查165架较旧的波音737NG飞机，以确定是否存在结构性裂缝。10月中旬，美国波音公司表示，在对旗下810架波音737NG喷射客机进行检查后，发现其中38架存在结构性裂缝，必须加以修理，并更换受影响的零件。24日，韩国3家航空公司停飞了9架波音737NG客机，原因是这9架飞机均存在结构性裂缝。
