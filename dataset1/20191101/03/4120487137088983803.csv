丹麦批准“北溪-2”项目丹麦段管线建设

01 Nov 2019, 03:29

【新华财经哥本哈根讯】丹麦能源署周三宣布向“北溪-2”天然气管道项目颁发许可，批准建设经过丹麦博恩霍尔姆岛东南部、长度为147千米的双管线。丹麦能源署网站发布公报说，根据有关法律，如没有关切方在2019年11月27日前提出申诉，“北溪-2”在上述地点的建设许可将正式生效。“北溪-2”项目旨在铺设一条由俄罗斯经波罗的海海底到德国的天然气管道，绕开乌克兰把俄罗斯天然气输送到德国，继而输送到其他欧洲国家。项目管道总长1230千米，已完成大部分管道建设。丹麦段管线是该项目建设的最后一环。此前，“北溪-2”项目承建商多次向丹麦政府提交建设申请，但一直未获通过。据俄媒体报道，俄罗斯总统普京30日表示，俄方对丹麦批准“北溪-2”项目建设表示欢迎，这一决定表明丹麦是国际合作中负责任的参与方。“北溪-2”项目管线途经俄罗斯、瑞典、芬兰、丹麦和德国的水域或专属经济区。建成后，俄每年将向德国输气550亿立方米，可满足欧洲10%的天然气需求。美国政府此前警告德国不要依赖俄罗斯能源，并威胁将就“北溪-2”项目实施制裁。

Denmark approves pipeline construction in the Danish section of the “Beixi-2” project

01 Nov 2019, 03:29

[Xinhua Finance News] The Danish Energy Agency announced on Wednesday that it has issued a permit to the “Beixi-2” natural gas pipeline project to approve the construction of a 147-kilometer-long double pipeline through the southeastern part of Bornholm Island, Denmark. The Danish Energy Agency website issued a bulletin saying that according to the relevant laws, if there is no concern to file a complaint before November 27, 2019, the construction permit of “Beixi-2” at the above location will come into effect. The “Beixi-2” project aims to lay a natural gas pipeline from Russia to the German Sea via the Baltic Sea, bypassing Ukraine and transporting Russian gas to Germany and then to other European countries. The total length of the project pipeline is 1,230 kilometers, and most of the pipeline construction has been completed. The Danish pipeline is the last link in the construction of the project. Previously, the “Beixi-2” project contractor submitted the construction application to the Danish government several times, but it has not been approved. According to Russian media reports, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on the 30th that the Russian side welcomed Denmark's approval of the construction of the ""Beixi-2"" project, which indicates that Denmark is a responsible participant in international cooperation. The “Beixi-2” project pipeline passes through the waters or exclusive economic zones of Russia, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Germany. After completion, Russia will transport 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year to Germany, which can meet 10% of natural gas demand in Europe. The US government has previously warned Germany not to rely on Russian energy and threatened to impose sanctions on the ""North Stream-2"" project.
