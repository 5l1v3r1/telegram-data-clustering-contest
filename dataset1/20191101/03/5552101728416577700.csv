鴻海創辦人郭台銘相當重視5G與人工智慧（AI）發展，甫於今年6月接任鴻海董事長劉揚偉也亦步亦趨，大力培養台灣AI人才，與台大合作推動AI系列講座，明年更將讓智慧機器Pepper上場，一同加入授課行列。1日劉揚偉更獻出校園演講處女秀，出席台大EMA與資管學會主辦的高峰論壇，以「5G百倍速與多樣性的時代來臨」為題，講述5G對台灣產業轉型的新契機。
鴻海創辦人郭台銘積極提倡AI智慧島，日前在臉書表示，「AI智慧島」關乎台灣未來20年發展的關鍵，很多人會說對AI不懂，感覺很遙遠，還有人說AI會搶了人的工作，但其實大部分是誤解，就像是有了汽車，沒有人會想要牛車及人力車，大家需要的是擁抱科技的勇氣，改變台灣未來的集氣。
為了推廣AI，郭董還特別邀請專家學者合力編撰了「人工智慧（AI）導論」，免費提供8,000本給高中職與五專老師、學生、家長、大學師生個人申請。而身為台灣最大民營企業的鴻海也亦步亦趨跟著創辦人的腳步大力推廣AI教育。
今年1月起，鴻海與台灣大學職涯中心執行長劉春梅合作，推動AI系列講座，以「AI數位時代．突破跨領域的藩籬」為主題開設8堂講座（每堂2小時），校內不限科系專業的學生都可選修，已於10月28日講座結束，累計近千名台大教師與學生們受惠。
為了讓更多不懂AI的學子參與，鴻海與台大將於明年4月舉辦第2梯次講座，將加入AI與實務結合案例，突顯出人文社會學領域學生對AI運用。不排除讓鴻海與日本軟銀共同研發的智慧機器人Pepper上場，一同加入授課行列，融合更多實務運用元素。
身為鴻海董事長的劉揚偉也獻出校園演講處女秀，1日接受台大EMBA與資管學會的邀請，出席一場5G行動大未來的高峰論壇，並以「5G—百倍速與多樣性的時代來臨」為題，對台大學生們進行一個小時的專題演講，希望能夠讓學子們了解5G對台灣產業轉型的新機會。

Hon Hai, the founder of Hon Hai, attaches great importance to the development of 5G and artificial intelligence (AI). In June this year, Liu Yangwei, the chairman of Hon Hai, took over and step by step. He vigorously cultivated Taiwan AI talents, cooperated with National Taiwan University to promote AI series lectures, and will let the smart machine Pepper play next year. Join the class together. On the 1st, Liu Yangwei also presented the campus speech debut, attended the summit forum hosted by the EMA and the Institute of Asset Management of the National Taiwan University, and gave a new opportunity for the transformation of Taiwan's industry with the theme of ""5G 100-speed and diversity era.""
Honghai founder Guo Taiming actively promoted AI Wisdom Island. Recently, Facebook said that ""AI Wisdom Island"" is the key to Taiwan's development in the next 20 years. Many people will say that they don't understand AI. It feels very far away. Some people say that AI will steal. People's work, but in fact most of them are misunderstood, just like having a car, no one wants a cow car and a rickshaw. What everyone needs is the courage to embrace technology and change the future of Taiwan.
In order to promote AI, Guo Dong also specially invited experts and scholars to jointly compile the ""Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)"", providing 8,000 copies of free applications for high school and five teachers, students, parents, university teachers and students. As the largest private enterprise in Taiwan, Hon Hai is also following the footsteps of the founders to promote AI education.
Since January this year, Hon Hai has cooperated with Liu Chunmei, CEO of Taiwan University's Career Center, to promote the AI series of lectures and to open 8 lectures (2 hours per session) under the theme of “AI Digital Age. Breaking through cross-cutting barriers”. The students majoring in science are optional. The lecture ended on October 28th, and nearly 1,000 Taiwan University teachers and students benefited.
In order to let more students who do not understand AI participate, Hon Hai and NTU will hold the second echelon lecture in April next year, which will join the case of AI and practice, highlighting the use of AI by students in the field of humanities and sociology. It is not excluded that the smart robot Pepper, which was jointly developed by Hon Hai and Softbank, will join the class and integrate more practical application elements.
Liu Yangwei, the chairman of Hon Hai, also presented the campus speech debut. On the 1st, he received an invitation from the EMBA and the Institute of Asset Management of the National Taiwan University to attend a summit forum for the future of 5G action and came with the era of 5G-100 times speed and diversity. As a topic, an hour-long special speech was given to Taiwanese university students, hoping to let students understand the new opportunities for 5G's transformation of Taiwan's industry.
