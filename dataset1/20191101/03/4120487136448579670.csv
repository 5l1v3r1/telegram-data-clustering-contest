美联储主席称美国贸易政策及影响 是其决定降息的一个因素

01 Nov 2019, 03:30

【路透华盛顿讯】美国联邦储备委员会(美联储/FED)主席鲍威尔(Jerome Powell)周三表示，美国贸易政策及其对企业投资、制造业和出口的影响是美联储降息时考虑的一项主要因素。但美联储在声明中还暗示，短期内不打算继续降息。鲍威尔在美联储降息后的记者会上解释称，贸易问题也在其利率决定中产生重要影响。“全球经济增长疲弱和贸易形势拖累经济，”鲍威尔称，解释了他降息的理由。但他补充称，“我们还看到经济前景面临的风险或许在朝正面方向发展，不过这仍有待观察。”他在回复记者提问时表示，美联储监控的“主要风险”是全球经济增长减缓以及贸易政策动向，并补充称他主要是指贸易形势。鲍威尔称，他与其他美联储官员都乐观地认为，美国和中国将签署一项初步协议，让长达16个月的贸易战休战。“美国可能和中国签署第一阶段贸易协议，如果该协议签署并生效，可能缓和贸易紧张局势并降低不确定性，”鲍威尔说。“这将提振企业信心，并且可能在一段时间后提振经济活动。”鲍威尔说，如果经济经历“贸易紧张局势持续、广泛的缓和，不确定因素的消除，那么将有利于增强企业信心，”这可能最终影响经济活动。投资者也对“第一阶段”协议达成持乐观看法，推动标普500指数本周升至日内纪录高位，因预期协议将近。本月早些时候的贸易谈判后美国官员称，美国总统特朗普和中国国家主席习近平可能在11月中旬的亚太经合组织(APEC)会议间隙签署协议。但该协议何时签署现在还不清楚，智利政府周三宣布，出于安全担忧，将取消主办在圣地亚哥举行的APEC峰会。

[Reuters Washington] US Federal Reserve Board (Fed/FED) Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that US trade policy and its impact on corporate investment, manufacturing and exports are a major factor in the Fed's interest rate cuts. However, the Fed also hinted in the statement that it does not intend to continue to cut interest rates in the short term. Powell explained at a press conference after the Fed’s interest rate cut that trade issues also have an important impact on their interest rate decisions. “The weak global economic growth and the trade situation drag on the economy,” Powell said, explaining the reasons for his interest rate cut. But he added, ""We also see that the risks facing the economic outlook may be moving in a positive direction, but this remains to be seen."" In response to a reporter's question, he said that the ""main risk"" of the Fed's monitoring is the slowdown in global economic growth and Trade policy trends, adding that he mainly refers to the trade situation. Powell said he and other Fed officials are optimistic that the United States and China will sign a preliminary agreement to allow a 16-month trade war truce. ""The United States may sign a first-stage trade agreement with China. If the agreement is signed and comes into force, it may ease trade tensions and reduce uncertainty,"" Powell said. “This will boost business confidence and may boost economic activity after a while.” Powell said that if the economic experience “continuous, widespread easing of trade tensions and the elimination of uncertainties, it will help to strengthen business confidence. ""This may ultimately affect economic activity. Investors also expressed optimism about the “first phase” agreement, pushing the S&P 500 index to a record high this week, as the agreement is near. US trade officials said after the trade talks earlier this month that US President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may sign an agreement at the APEC meeting in mid-November. But it is unclear when the agreement will be signed. The Chilean government announced on Wednesday that it will cancel the hosting of the APEC summit in San Diego due to security concerns.
