高雄監獄一名陳姓收容人兩週前突嘔吐陷入昏迷，送往國軍高雄總醫院治療後，宣告不治身亡；原本全案依病故處理，但檢方會同法醫複驗後，卻發現陳男死因不單純，疑似有外力介入，因此展開偵辦，並前往高監展開搜索。隨後傳喚2名戒護科管理人員以及4名涉案雜役，檢方複訊後認為6人涉案重大，於10月31日當庭逮捕，並向法院聲請羈押獲准。
據了解，這名陳姓收容人因家暴案件入獄，在監期間時常與其他收容人發生衝突，且有不服獄方管理情事。日前陳姓收容人在與人肢體衝突後突然嘔吐且陷入昏迷，獄方發現旋即將他送往醫院救治，無奈最終仍宣告不治身亡。原本獄方以單純病故處理，但檢方會同法醫複驗後，發現陳姓收容人的死因並不單純，疑似有外力介入痕跡，因此積極介入查辦。
檢方透露，目前初步解剖，發現陳姓收容人身上有一些傷痕，疑似有外力介入因素，但目前一切尚未明朗，仍在釐清中，且法醫鑑定完整報告也尚未出爐，暫未釐清詳細致死原因。
檢警在介入偵辦後，於10月30日展開搜索，並傳喚獄內涉案的6嫌到案，包括2名戒護科管理人員、及4名雜役，由於6人供詞有明顯出入，因此複訊後檢方已當庭將6人逮捕，並向法院聲請羈押獲准。
