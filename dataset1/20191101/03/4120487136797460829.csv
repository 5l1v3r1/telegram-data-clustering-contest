[Reporter] Commercial building owners must pay attention to the safety of customers and leasing businesses so that they can accommodate all activities inside. Anarta Kreasindo senior architect Prasetyawan said that the safety elements of a building must be able to form a rescue facility, such as a fire, in the event of a hazard. “Therefore, there is a need for fire safety systems such as smoke or heat detectors, building alarms, to compartments and cover options. Doors are an important refuge element but are easy to use so that users can escape.” He said . He continued, of course, the conditions of this door are easy to open and pass, and need to be wide enough that shoppers can escape at the same time. One option that can be used is a roller shutter or a louvered door. “In every building with a functional area of more than 5,000 square meters, an automatic fire shutter door must be provided for the fire compartment,” he said. According to him, in fact, the building safety element has been laid down in the No. 20/PRT/M/2009 Minister of Public Works Regulations on fire management technical specifications. “Therefore, architects play an important role in designing to prevent accidents, such as fires. Architects must pay attention to supporting the escape aspects of renters and buyers,” he said. In fact, domestic industry has been able to produce fire shutter doors. Among them is a rolling door or shutter door produced by Sanwamas Metal Industry, which has a two-hour fire test certificate, so that the evacuation process can be assisted within this time frame. According to Rini Dewi Anggraeni, brand and marketing communications manager at Sanwamas Metal Industry, fire shutters have been used in commercial areas, such as shopping malls, as well as public transport buildings such as the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and light rail stations (LRT). ). She revealed that Sanwamas is a roller shutter manufacturer established under the Sanwa Holdings Corporation in Japan and the Rodamas Group in Indonesia. “In the production of rolling shutters, Sanwamas insists on three principles, namely safety, security and convenience,” she said.
