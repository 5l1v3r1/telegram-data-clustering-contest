Desus and Mero Found the Spookiest Thing: a Gentrified Bronx
01 Nov 2019, 03:55 by Bethy Squires



Happy Halloween, Bodega hive! Desus and Mero not only dressed up for the holiday — they gentrified their set. They added condos, Citi Bikes, and a dog-massage parlor. And before you even ask: Yes, they can use CBD massage oil for an upcharge. Desus dressed as a dude who went to Yale and bought a brownstone, whereas Mero was a man-bunned high-fashion art idiot. Do they take their dog to Two Hands One Pup? Absolutely, and they get the CBD upgrade.
