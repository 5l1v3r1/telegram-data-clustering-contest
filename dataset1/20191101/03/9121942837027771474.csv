LONDON (AP) — A British Parliamentary committee says many people with autism or learning disabilities are being detained in “horrific” conditions and is calling for an overhaul of the system intended to evaluate their treatment.
The Joint Committee on Human Rights said in a report issued Friday it heard “stark” evidence about how young people with disabilities or autism were being held. It said one boy’s arm was broken in a restraint and he did not receive medical attention for 24 hours.
The committee said it has “lost confidence that the system is doing what it says it is doing” and said the regulator’s approach “is not working.” It described the detention of young people with autism or disabilities as “often inappropriate.”
