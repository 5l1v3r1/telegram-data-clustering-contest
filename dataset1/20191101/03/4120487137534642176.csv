【罗盘报新闻网雅加达10月31日讯】10月20日刚宣誓就职开启第二届总统任期的佐科威总统周四（10月31日）在雅京总统府举行的政法安局部内阁会议上，特地指令所有执法机构，包括肃贪会（KPK），必须协助塑造国内良好的投资环境，吸引外国企业前来我国投资。总统说：“我已下令政法安统筹部长、国家警察总长、总检察长和肃贪会必须确保投资者、工商企业和市场参与者的安全以获得法律的保障，并保证政府的计划能顺利展开和按时落实。”总统接着说，无数事实说明，到目前为止，许多事情实际上因为受制于法律问题而无法顺利推行。我们必须持续简化繁文褥节的经商和投资手续。总统续说，有很多投资者都冀望前往我国投资经商，但由于法律上的确定性令投资者处于观望的态度，质疑我国的法律保障，因此迟迟不敢做出决定到我国投资。总统还说：“很多国内商业界领导和投资者，包括国营企业领导都害怕被执法机构故意刁难，无中生有寻找犯错，导致许多发展计划原地踏步停滞不前拖延时间。我在再次要求千万不要把私企和国企成为获取利益的对象。”出席本次局部内阁会议有政法安统筹部长马福特（Mahfud MD）、国家警察暂摄总长阿里中将（Ari Dono）和总检察长布汉努汀（ST Burhanuddin）。但未见肃贪会领导人出席该会议。（v）
