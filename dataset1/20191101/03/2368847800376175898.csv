香港警察被「繳槍」？高層失權內幕曝光

01 Nov 2019, 03:48

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】香港前中央政策組全職顧問、資深時事評論員劉細良日前對大紀元透露，中共長期滲透香港警察工會，包括青關會內的親共組織花巨資收買警方，港警已變成了中共公安，警隊高層官員被劫持，失去權力。
香港爆發「反送中」運動以來，警察暴力鎮壓示威民眾，致使局勢日趨惡化。劉細良表示，香港目前的局勢是警察暴力相向造成的，在前線使用暴力的警察粗口爛舌，完全是流氓形象。
他透露，警察之所以這樣明目張膽，如此霸道，是因為中共在香港的政治勢力滲透到了警察工會，控制了中下層的警察，警隊高層官員都被中下層警察劫持了。
劉細良說，在97年之前，在警察薪酬待遇方面需要一個集體談判的組織，因此才容許警察工會存在，並不是讓他來搞政治的。但現在警察工會一直活躍於政治領域，不少親共組織給警察捐了巨額錢財，僅青關會就捐了幾十萬。這完全沒規矩了，在英治時代是王家警察，不會容許這些事情發生的。
劉細良認為，當警察工會變成一個政治工具的時候，港警必然就變成了中共公安。以往港警是公務員，現在已經不是公務員，其實警務處長已經失去了對警隊的控制，這即是所謂下克上。
他舉例說，劉澤基只是香港警察機動部隊警署警長，居然可以挑戰特首林鄭月娥。還有一個僅是警察員佐級協會的主席也可以去罵大學的校長，以至於教育局長楊潤雄、政務司司長張建宗都沒話說。
劉細良指出，香港警察的轉變始於林慧思事件。2013年7月14日，教師林慧思在旺角不滿共黨地下組織青關會搗亂法輪功街站，路見不平，出聲譴責。而在場警察不僅對青關會的搗亂視若無睹，反而要求林慧思離開，這顯然違反了警察的基本職能。
此後，幕後的政治勢力還有意識地借一些事件，如雨傘運動、曾健超事件等一路鼓動警察工會，中間可能還有一些請客吃飯，公關活動，康樂活動等把警察工會拉攏到它們那邊去，而不是拉攏總警司、行動處副處長等高層。
劉細良表示，最近有傳聞香港員佐級警員（初級警務人員，包括警署警長、警長、高級警員及警員）可以用優惠的折扣，購買大陸地產商在大灣區的房產。媒體應該調查，如果確有其事，說明整個警隊被政治操控並不是始於反送中運動。



談到香港未來的局勢變化，劉細良分析，中共各部門對香港所採取的手段可能是不同的，哪個部門對處理香港問題的影響力大，他的路線就佔有壓倒優勢。
如果中共公安國安插手香港事務，一定傾向於「打」；而其它部門如國務院的官僚，可能會試圖緩和局面。現在國安公安或者政法委的聲音比較大，所以8、9、10月這幾個月是一條強硬鎮壓路線。
他說，這條左傾路線，左毒一日不除，香港就不會恢復正常的管治，到時還會搞出其它問題。就是說如果張曉明這種政治人物不下台或不調職，光換一個特首是沒用的。
劉細良也表示，中共有想緩和香港局勢的跡象，如中共希望區議會在11月底如常進行。本來已經DQ了很多民主派人士等，但最終只DQ了黃之鋒。這表明中共希望區議會選舉順利進行，將街頭勇武抗爭的能量吸納到選舉裡，從而平息街頭抗爭。
他還提到林鄭月娥可能今年年底就該下台了。林鄭早前表示，到年底監警會會交報告，並說她支持的是警隊的組織而不是盲撐警隊，不是支持個別的警察。
劉細良認為，「這個可圈可點」，但林鄭此舉會讓劉澤基等中下層警察相當憤怒。目前，監警會已經表明處理7．21和8．31事件，如果由監警會建議成立獨立調查委員會，就不是林鄭在出賣警隊，而是由監警會負責。到今年年底這兩步走完，林鄭就該下台了。

Hong Kong police are being ""paid""? High-level dissident insider exposure

01 Nov 2019, 03:48

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 01, 2019] Liu Jingliang, a full-time consultant and senior commentator of the former Central Policy Group of Hong Kong, revealed to the Epoch Times that the CCP has long infiltrated the Hong Kong Police Union, including the pro-communist organizations in the Qingguan Association. After buying the police, the Hong Kong police have become the CCP public security, and high-ranking police officers have been hijacked and lost power.
Since the ""reverse delivery"" campaign broke out in Hong Kong, police violently suppressed the demonstrators and caused the situation to worsen. Liu Xiliang said that the current situation in Hong Kong is caused by the violence of the police. The police who use violence on the front line are rude and ruthless.
He revealed that the reason why the police were so brazen and so overbearing was because the political forces of the CCP in Hong Kong infiltrated the police union and controlled the middle and lower police. The top police officers were hijacked by the middle and lower police.
Liu Xiliang said that before 1997, a collective bargaining organization was needed in the police remuneration package, so the police union was allowed to exist, and it was not for him to engage in politics. But now the police union has been active in the political arena. Many pro-communist organizations donated huge sums of money to the police. Only the Qingguan Association donated hundreds of thousands. This is completely unruly. It was a royal policeman during the British rule and would not allow these things to happen.
Liu Xiliang believes that when the police union becomes a political tool, the Hong Kong police will inevitably become the CCP public security. In the past, the Hong Kong Police was a civil servant. Now it is no longer a civil servant. In fact, the Commissioner of Police has lost control of the police force. This is the so-called gram.
For example, he said that Liu Zeji is only the police chief of the Hong Kong Police Tactical Police Station. He can actually challenge the Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue. There is also a president who is only a police officer and a so-called association. He can also go to the president of the university, so that the education director Yang Runxiong and the Chief Secretary for Administration, Zhang Jianzong, have nothing to say.
Liu Xiliang pointed out that the transformation of the Hong Kong police began with the Lin Huisi incident. On July 14, 2013, teacher Lin Huisi was dissatisfied with the Communist Party’s underground organization in the Mong Kok area to disrupt the Falun Gong Street Station. The road was uneven and condemned. The police on the scene not only turned a blind eye to the chaos of the Qingguan, but instead asked Lin Huisi to leave, which clearly violated the basic functions of the police.
Since then, the political forces behind the scenes have consciously borrowed some events, such as umbrella sports, Zeng Jianchao incidents, etc., to encourage police unions. There may be some guests in the middle to eat, public relations activities, recreational activities, etc., to bring police unions to their side. Rather than wooing the Chief Superintendent and the Deputy Director of the Operations Department.
Liu Xiliang said that it has recently been rumored that Hong Kong staff members (primary police officers, including police sheriffs, sheriffs, senior police officers and police officers) can use the discounts to purchase real estate developers in Dawan District. The media should investigate, if it does, it means that the entire police force is not politically controlled.



When talking about the future changes in Hong Kong, Liu Xiliang analyzed that the means adopted by the various departments of the CCP may be different. Which department has a great influence on handling the Hong Kong issue, and his route has an overwhelming advantage.
If the CCP public security Guoan intervenes in Hong Kong affairs, it will tend to ""hit""; other departments, such as the State Department's bureaucrats, may try to ease the situation. Now the national security or political and legal committee has a relatively loud voice, so the months of August, September and October are a tough repression.
He said that this left-leaning route, if the left poison is not removed, Hong Kong will not resume normal governance and other problems will arise. That is to say, if Zhang Xiaoming’s politician does not step down or does not transfer his duties, it is useless to change a special chief.
Liu Xiliang also said that the Chinese Communist Party wants to ease the signs of the situation in Hong Kong. For example, the Chinese Communist Party hopes that the district boards will proceed as usual at the end of November. Originally DQ had a lot of democrats, but in the end only DQ Huang Zhifeng. This shows that the CCP hopes that the district board elections will proceed smoothly, and absorb the energy of street brave struggles into the elections, thus quelling street protests.
He also mentioned that Lin Zhengyue may have to step down at the end of this year. Lin Zheng said earlier that by the end of the year, the IPCC will submit a report and said that she supports the police organization rather than blindly supporting the police, not supporting individual police.
Liu Xiliang believes that ""this is a good thing to do,"" but Lin Zheng’s move will make Liu Zeji and other middle and lower policemen quite angry. At present, the IPCC has indicated that it will deal with the events of 7.21 and 8.31. If the IPCC recommends the establishment of an independent investigation committee, it is not that Lin Zheng is selling the police team, but the police are responsible. By the end of the two steps at the end of this year, Lin Zheng should be stepped down.
