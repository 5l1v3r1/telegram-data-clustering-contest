Rob Vanstone: Saskatchewan Roughriders head coach Craig Dickenson scores points with his honesty
Saskatchewan Roughriders head coach Craig Dickenson is unfailingly, applaudably honest with the people who play for and cover the team.

Craig Dickenson was honest when asked about his penchant for honesty.
“I’m not a good BS’er, I guess,” the Saskatchewan Roughriders’ first-year head coach said.
“I just feel like when people ask you a question, you do your best to answer it truthfully and honestly, and if you don’t feel comfortable answering it, you just tell them so.
“I don’t really know why I’m that way. I just am.”
Thank goodness for that. In a day and age when so many football coaches opt for obfuscation or obstinacy, Dickenson is a refreshing change. Ask him a question and you shall receive a forthright, informative response, with more than a sprinkle of humanity.
Dickenson is not a dispenser of pigskin pablum such as “we’re on to Cincinnati” or “our goal is to go 1-and-0 this week.” He understands that the media is a conduit to the fans — the lifeblood of a community-owned franchise — and strives to keep the paying public informed.
Sure, there are times when sensitive information is withheld, but it is done respectfully. And he isn’t going to give away the playbook, simply because some ink-stained scribbler poses a question relating to strategy.
However, Dickenson will peel back some layers and provide as much insight as possible without compromising preparations for the upcoming game.
If a player has a concussion, Dickenson isn’t inclined to resort to “upper-body injury.” When quarterback Zach Collaros was concussed early this season, it was Dickenson who provided confirmation, as was the case after linebacker Cameron Judge sustained a blow to the head on Saturday.



Dickenson’s candour is not reserved for the media. It is part of his modus operandi when dealing with the players.
“Even kids, but especially grown men, they just want the truth,” Dickenson said. “If you’re honest with people and tell them up-front how you feel and what you see, I think they can live with good news and bad news. That’s just my style and so far it has worked OK.”
Has it ever. The Roughriders’ double-digit victory total is especially impressive when you consider what has transpired during the 2019 calendar year.
Only one week after signing a contract extension, Chris Jones stepped down in January to join the Cleveland Browns’ coaching staff. Suddenly, the Roughriders were without a head coach, defensive co-ordinator, general manager and vice-president of football operations.
Jeremy O’Day was quickly promoted to fill the latter two positions. His first major move as the GM was to hire Dickenson as the head coach.
The Roughriders were unexpectedly shifting gears in the middle of the winter, while attempting to address the one major void that Jones had left behind.
Who was going to play quarterback?
Collaros was re-signed on Feb. 11, after O’Day unsuccessfully tried to woo marquee signal-caller Bo Levi Mitchell away from Calgary, and there were yawns.
O’Day also added a quarterback named Cody Fajardo, who had been a short-yardage specialist for most of his first three full CFL seasons. Fajardo was thrust into front-line duty much earlier than anyone had expected, after Collaros suffered a concussion on just the third play of the regular season.

In came Fajardo, whose passing prowess didn’t initially lead to victories.
The Roughriders had records of 0-2 and 1-3 before going on a 9-1 roll that enabled them to nail down a playoff berth during what appeared at one point to be a transitional year.
“Coach Dickenson is so positive, and it creates a positive energy,” said Fajardo, himself a beacon of honesty. “Guys want to be here.
“Guys don’t think of this as work. They think of this as football, which it should be. It’s a sport. We’re playing a game for money, which is incredible. We’re very blessed to do so and a lot of guys realize that.”
Dickenson echoed those sentiments when asked about his openness to publicly critiquing, and even lamenting, some of his own tactical decisions. Many head coaches would rather attend a Kevin James film festival than second-guess themselves in front of the jackals of the media. But Dickenson, as you have likely ascertained by now, isn’t a typical football field boss — simply an excellent one.
“I think you have to be honest with yourself,” the down-to-earth Montanan said. “I’m not afraid of failure.
“I feel very fortunate to be able to coach the Saskatchewan Roughriders. I felt very fortunate to be able to coach when I was an assistant coach. I felt very fortunate when I was a student coach.
“I’ve got a good life, I’ve got a good job, and I want to be the best I can. Being honest with yourself is a good way to start.”
