食正互聯網醫療趨勢 平安好醫生的投資價值｜洪龍荃
01 Nov 2019, 15:03 by 投資
互聯網醫療是我們最近的研究熱點，而平安好醫生就是行業龍頭之一，筆者認為平安好醫生具備巨大的先行優勢。筆者確信互聯網醫療的發展將會提速，是因為國家醫保局於9月底公布《國家醫療保障局關於完善「互聯網＋」醫療服務價格和醫保支付政策的指導意見》，正式明確互聯網醫療可以使用醫保支付，要求各省醫保局制定相應的支付流程。

平安好醫生具先行優勢
過往一直困擾互聯網醫療的最大問題便是醫保支付，因為病人在互聯網醫療平台上的各種費用只能用現金支付；但是隨著政策放開，問題將迎刃而解。根據市場機構預測，自2016年起線上問診增速達到35%，到2025年，年均線上問診達到35億次，佔所有診療的26%。內地互聯網醫療市場規模於2018年達455億元人民幣，預期未來五年年均複合增長率約為40.12%，2022年將達到1,754億元人民幣。
現時，內地的優質醫療資源稀缺及分布不均，導致醫療質素最佳的三級醫院（佔醫院總數僅8%）負擔了高達50%的診療，這令醫療服務體驗變差。而且這些較好的三級醫院往往位於大城市，偏遠城市的好醫院、好醫生則稀缺，也令到醫療服務不到位。伴隨著居民生活水平提升，對健康管理的需求日益旺盛，過去以治療為主、忽略預防及康復的醫療模式，顯然已經不能滿足需求，互聯網醫療成為解決分級診療問題的唯一出路。當發現了好行業，下一步便要尋找投資標的，究竟哪家公司會在競爭激烈的市場中突圍而出？

背靠平保的平安好醫生
環顧整個互聯網醫療行業，除了平安好醫生（01833）之外，還有微醫、春雨醫生、阿里健康（00241）、好大夫在線。當中，筆者認為平安好醫生具備巨大的先行優勢，其招股書列出於2016年時平安好醫生的月活躍用戶（MAU）為2,180萬，位列行業第一，是行業第二的5倍，遙遙領先。況且，最重要是平安好醫生背靠內地最强的保險集團中國平安（02318）。
投行中信建設曾經測算，平安好醫生2018年自有渠道獲客成本低於每人15元人民幣，綜合獲客成本低於每人10元人民幣，遠較其他對手平均每人200元的獲客成本為低。平安好醫生的收入主要由在線醫療、消費型醫療、健康商城以及健康管理和互動等四大業務板塊構成，單從數據上看，四大業務板塊均保持強勁的增長態勢。
平安好醫生董事長兼首席執行官王濤於2019年中期業績會上表示，希望繼續將毛利率較高的在線醫療業務板塊做強做大，並指出平安好醫生與商業保險公司的合作與會員制，是在線醫療商業化的重要方向，也是在線醫療板塊的主要收入來源和增長動力。為了進一步擴展該業務的規模，今年6月平安好醫生推出了戰略級付費會員新產品「平安好醫生私人醫生」，目標為2億以上的新中產人群打造全方位、高品質的醫療健康服務。

Food positive Internet medical trend Ping An good doctor's investment value|Hong Longzhen
01 Nov 2019, 15:03 by Investment
Internet medical care is our recent research hotspot, and Ping An Good Doctor is one of the industry leaders. The author believes that Ping An Good Doctor has a huge first-mover advantage. The author is convinced that the development of Internet medical care will speed up because the National Health Insurance Bureau announced at the end of September that the National Health Insurance Administration's guidance on improving the ""Internet +"" medical service price and medical insurance payment policy, officially clarified that Internet medical care can be paid using medical insurance. The provincial medical insurance bureaus are required to formulate corresponding payment procedures.

Peaceful doctor has a first advantage
The biggest problem that has plagued Internet medical care in the past is the payment of medical insurance, because the various expenses of patients on the Internet medical platform can only be paid in cash; but as the policy is released, the problem will be solved. According to market agency forecasts, online consultations have grown by 35% since 2016. By 2025, the average annual online consultation has reached 3.5 billion, accounting for 26% of all medical treatments. The size of the mainland Internet medical market reached 45.5 billion yuan in 2018. It is expected that the compound annual growth rate will be 40.12% in the next five years and 177.5 billion yuan in 2022.
At present, the quality of medical resources in the Mainland is scarce and unevenly distributed. The tertiary hospitals with the best quality of medical care (only 8% of the total number of hospitals) are responsible for up to 50% of the diagnosis and treatment, which makes the medical service experience worse. Moreover, these better tertiary hospitals are often located in large cities. The good hospitals and good doctors in remote cities are scarce, and medical services are not in place. With the improvement of residents' living standards, the demand for health management is growing. In the past, the medical model based on treatment and neglecting prevention and rehabilitation obviously cannot meet the demand. Internet medical treatment has become the only way to solve the problem of graded diagnosis and treatment. When a good industry is discovered, the next step is to find the investment target. Which company will break out in a highly competitive market?

Looking around the entire Internet medical industry, in addition to the safe doctor (01833), there are also micro-medicine, Chun Yu doctor, Ali Health (00241), good doctor online.

Leading the way. Moreover, the most important thing is that Ping An is backed by Ping An (02318), the strongest insurance group in the Mainland.
Investment bank CITIC Construction once estimated that Ping An’s doctors’ own channel cost is lower than RMB 15 per person in 2018, and the comprehensive customer cost is less than RMB 10 per person, which is far more than the average cost of RMB 200 per person. It is low. The income of Ping An Doctor is mainly composed of four major business segments: online medical care, consumer medical care, health mall and health management and interaction. From the data point of view, the four business segments have maintained strong growth.
Wang Tao, Chairman and CEO of Ping An Good Doctor, said at the 2019 Interim Results Meeting that he hopes to continue to strengthen the online medical business sector with higher gross profit margin and point out the cooperation and membership of Ping An Good Doctor and Commercial Insurance Company. It is an important direction for online medical commercialization and the main source of income and growth for the online medical sector. In order to further expand the scale of this business, in June this year, Ping An Good Doctor launched a new product of the strategic-level paying member ""Ping An Good Doctor Private Doctor"", aiming to create a full range of high-quality medical and health services for the new middle-class people of more than 200 million.
