01 Nov 2019, 15:00 by 投資
Visa（美股代號：V）、Mastercard（美股代號：MA）、eBay（美股代號：EBAY）、Stripe、Mercado Pago和PayPal（美股代號：PYPL）相繼退出天秤幣（Libra）聯盟，對Facebook（美股代號：FB）的分布式全球加密貨幣計劃，造成重大打擊。

今年6月中旬，Facebook發布Libra天秤幣計劃，宣告進入加密貨幣領域。Libra天秤幣是Facebook開發中的全球加密貨幣，原計劃於2020年推出；據了解，Libra天秤幣將不是像比特幣那樣的投機資產，而是一種由抵押資產支持的數字貨幣。
Facebook與其他27個合作夥伴組成了Libra天秤幣聯盟，以監督其發展和運行，其合作夥伴包括大型金融企業、風險投資公司、加密技術公司、電訊和技術服務供應商、非營利組織。信用卡巨頭Visa和Mastercard、電商巨頭eBay、電子支付巨頭PayPal及電子支付初創公司Stripe、拉丁美洲支付應用公司Mercado Pago、加密貨幣交易所Coinbase、電訊服務商Vodafone、在線音樂服務商Spotify（美股代號：SPOT）、網約車服務商Uber（美股代號：UBER）和Lyft（美股代號：LYFT）都在其列。

美國財政部施壓
據介紹，Libra天秤幣將確保每個貨幣單位都有內在價值的支持，其抵押資產主要是美國短期國債；不過，債券價格會受到貨幣政策影響，所以政策的不確定性可能影響貨幣價值。在正式面世後，Libra天秤幣可以調整未來可接受的抵押資產，可能逐步發展為一種成熟的商品貨幣，其價值由全球市場的定價來決定。
Libra天秤幣能否成功面世，仍存在很大變數，因為美國財政部長努欽曾表示，美國財政部已與Facebook的代表舉行了多次會議，並告知他們推出Libra天秤幣的計劃尚未成熟。財政部最大憂慮是，Libra天秤幣將讓用戶繞過反洗錢規則。據悉，財政部還去函Visa、Mastercard、 Stripe和PayPal，要求它們全面概述其合規計劃以及Libra項目將如何適應這些計劃，令Libra項目的合作夥伴倍感壓力。

可能是因為這個緣故，Visa、Mastercard、eBay、Stripe、Mercado Pago和PayPal相繼退出了該項目。雖然其餘合作夥伴與Facebook簽署了文件，正式加入Libra天秤幣聯盟，但失去了全球最大四家支付公司，意味Facebook失去了此前為Libra集結的大部分力量，對旨在電子商務和跨境支付領域大展身手的Libra天秤幣項目造成衝擊。
面對美國監管部門的關注和憂慮，Facebook行政總裁朱克伯格（Mark Zukerberg）表示，Libra計劃的目的不是試圖創造一個主權貨幣或進入貨幣政策領域，而Libra會與聯邦儲備局及其他央行合作。朱克伯格支持推遲發布Libra天秤幣，並表示除非所有美國監管機構都滿意，否則該產品將不會在世界任何地方推出Facebook原本希望通過Libra天秤幣，成為電子商戶和全球匯款的參與者；不過有關Libra的消息並沒有對Facebook股價造成重大影響，今年以來，其股價累升近四成。

Libra Alliance collapses! Facebook Libra Coin Difficult to Produce | Huang Yijie
01 Nov 2019, 15:00 by Investment
Visa (US stock code: V), Mastercard (US stock code: MA), eBay (US stock code: EBAY), Stripe, Mercado Pago and PayPal (US stock code: PYPL) have successively withdrawn from the Libra alliance, on Facebook (US stock code) : FB) The distributed global cryptocurrency program caused a major blow.

In mid-June this year, Facebook released the Libra Libra Coin program, which announced its entry into the cryptocurrency field. Libra Libra is the global cryptocurrency developed by Facebook and was originally planned to be launched in 2020. It is understood that Libra Libra will not be a speculative asset like Bitcoin, but a digital currency supported by mortgage assets.
Facebook and the other 27 partners formed the Libra Libra Currency Alliance to oversee its development and operations. Its partners include large financial companies, venture capital firms, encryption technology companies, telecommunications and technology service providers, and non-profit organizations. Credit card giants Visa and Mastercard, e-commerce giant eBay, electronic payment giant PayPal and electronic payment startup Stripe, Latin American payment application company Mercado Pago, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, telecommunications service provider Vodafone, online music service provider Spotify (US stock code: SPOT), network car service providers Uber (US stock code: UBER) and Lyft (US stock code: LYFT) are listed.

US Treasury pressure
According to reports, Libra Libra will ensure that each currency unit has intrinsic value support, and its mortgage assets are mainly US short-term national debt; however, bond prices will be affected by monetary policy, so policy uncertainty may affect monetary value. After the official launch, Libra Librae can adjust future acceptable mortgage assets, which may gradually evolve into a mature commodity currency whose value is determined by pricing in the global market.
Whether Libra's Libra can be successfully launched still has a lot of variables, because US Treasury Secretary Nuchin has said that the US Treasury has held several meetings with Facebook representatives and told them that the plan to launch Libra Libra is not yet mature. The biggest worry for the Treasury is that Libra Libra will allow users to bypass anti-money laundering rules. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance also sent a letter to Visa, Mastercard, Stripe and PayPal, asking them to fully outline their compliance program and how the Libra project will adapt to these plans, making the Libra project partners feel pressure.

It may be for this reason that Visa, Mastercard, eBay, Stripe, Mercado Pago and PayPal have withdrawn from the project. Although the remaining partners signed a document with Facebook and officially joined the Libra Libra Currency Alliance, they lost the world's four largest payment companies, meaning that Facebook lost most of its previous strength for Libra, for e-commerce and cross-border payments. The Libra Libra coin project, which is a big show, has had an impact.
Faced with concerns and concerns from US regulators, Facebook CEO Mark Zukerberg said the Libra project is not intended to create a sovereign currency or enter monetary policy, while Libra will work with the Federal Reserve and other central banks. Zuckerberg supported the delay in the release of Libra Libra, and said that unless all US regulators are satisfied, the product will not be launched anywhere in the world. Facebook originally hoped to become a participant in e-commerce and global remittance through Libra Libra. Libra's news did not have a major impact on Facebook's share price, and its share price has risen nearly 40% this year.
