A juror has been discharged in the retrial of Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield.
The 75-year-old is standing trial at Preston Crown Court accused of the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans at the FA Cup semi-final on April 15 1989.
The male juror was discharged from the jury on Friday.
Court was adjourned until Tuesday, when the trial will continue.
 
Ninety-six men, women and children died following the crush on the Leppings Lane terrace at the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
Under the law at the time there can be no prosecution for the death of the 96th victim, Anthony Bland, as he died more than a year and a day after his injuries were caused.
 
Duckenfield, a retired South Yorkshire Police officer, stood trial in January but the jury was unable to return any verdict and was discharged.
