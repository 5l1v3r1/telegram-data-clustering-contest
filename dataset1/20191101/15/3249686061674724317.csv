From Halloween to Taelloween : Fans showcase creativity as edits of BTS V went viral on Twitter
01 Nov 2019, 15:51 by thepopscene



Each year, Halloween becomes a venue of how creative stan culture can result in truly wondrous things. Even before the actual festivity began, BTS fans have shown excitement and anticipation to show off their innovativeness, especially with BTS V as their favorite subject.  5 Years ago, fans remembered that in one Bangtan bomb, BTS V dressed as The  Joker. And now in 2019, this fan-made video went viral on Twitter for seemingly telling the story of his 'transformation'. 



A few days after this edit went viral, fans started the #Taelloween event, showcasing edited photos and video of BTS V. This one showed him as The Joker too, but his fake gum chewing really added to the effect!



This one looked so realistic, creepy yet sexy at the same time



And then we have ""Goth Taehyung""



Fans even went as far as changing the icon to ""Taerleyquin"" or Harlequin as part of the celebration



Even the famous chocolate brand @LindtUK couldn't escape the fun



The highlight of the excitement of the event peaked when BTS  uploaded videos through Tiktok wishing (and scaring) fans Happy Halloween with edited videos and proving they are not behind when it comes to fun and imagination.









Halloween proves to be a great opportunity for fans to show their ingenuity and an immersive atmosphere to create different ideas and make it into tangible reality, and Taelloween is no exception. We're excited to see what's in store next year!
