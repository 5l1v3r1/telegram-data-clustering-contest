Riders backup QB Isaac Harker is ready to go if needed
Saskatchewan Roughriders QB Isaac Harker could be called upon Saturday against the Edmonton Eskimos because of an injury to starter Cody Fajardo.

The Saskatchewan Roughriders believe that backup Isaac Harker could be a money quarterback.
That’s the word from head coach Craig Dickenson, who added some humour to a potentially serious situation on Thursday after it was revealed that Cody Fajardo pulled a back muscle during Wednesday’s closed practice at the University of Regina.
As a result, there’s a chance Harker could make his first CFL start in Saturday’s regular-season finale against the visiting Edmonton Eskimos.
“I didn’t see Cody (when the injury occurred), so we’ll have to make sure Isaac wasn’t slipping him a few 20s off to the side,” Dickenson said with a laugh.
“Cody has been durable, but injuries happen all the time. We’re hopeful it’s not that bad but, if it is, we’ll play the other two (quarterbacks).”
With Fajardo out, Harker and Bryan Bennett shared reps during Thursday’s indoor practice at the AffinityPlex.
Harker is No. 2 on the depth chart, so he’s next in line.
“We still don’t really know what’s going on — whether Cody’s starting or not,” Harker said. “If he’s ready to go, he’ll go. But if for any reason he can’t, then I’ll be ready, and I’m 100-per-cent confident with the plays we have. It’s a big game for us.”
Although Harker has been awaiting an opportunity, it doesn’t sound like any money changed hands.
The 24-year-old backup said he’s on “pins and needles” about the injury — just like the rest of Rider Nation.

“When your best friend on the team gets hurt, you get really concerned, obviously,” said Harker, who initially wasn’t sure what to think. “We have such a funny relationship that sometimes I can’t tell if he’s (serious), but he was in a good amount of pain. He’ll do anything he can do to get back in this game. This is one of the toughest quarterbacks in any league, let alone the CFL. So if he can be back, he will be back.”
Although Fajardo’s injury kept him out of practice, it wasn’t enough to prevent him from contributing to Saturday’s preparations. He spent time assisting Harker in the film room Wednesday after the rookie took first-team practice reps.
“He’s an invaluable tool to have,” Harker said. “It speaks volumes to who he is as a person.”
It’s also clear that the Riders support Harker, who has appeared in three games this season, completing 21 of 33 passes for 254 yards with no touchdowns and three picks.
Before Fajardo’s injury, the players had talked about trying to get him some mop-up duty against Edmonton.
A win over the Eskimos will secure first place in the West and an opening-round playoff bye.
“(Harker) wanted to play anyway,” said receiver Naaman Roosevelt. “We were like, ‘We’re going to go out there and give it our all and try to dominate and try to get you in this game.’ I know he has been excited to play. He’s ready to go.”
Dickenson called Harker “a super sharp guy” who understands the offence. The only thing missing is more live bullets, so the opportunity to play Saturday might serve the team well.
“Nothing simulates reps like a game,” Dickenson added. “It’s a great way to grow. Sometimes you learn through good experiences and bad but we certainly feel confident in him. He played in a game against Hamilton and played well. He has done nothing but practise well this whole year.
“If he plays, I think he’ll play well.”
