This Halloween, 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg sparked reactions by posting a black-and-white photograph of herself with her trademark school strike placard.
While stressing that she did not celebrate Halloween in Sweden, she thought that she “might give it a try” this year. The school strike movement figurehead claimed she scared “a bunch of angry climate crisis deniers” as she were, without even having to dress up, hence her usual look.



​In response, her numerous fans started posting photographs of themselves or their children dressed up as Gretas, with mock pigtails and the very same placard that made her famous.















​Even men tried to mimic Greta's look with yellow anorak and rubber boots.



​Some went so far as posting photographs of dogs dressed as Gretas.

​Greta Thunberg jumped the spotlight in 2018 owing to her solitary protest against climate change on the steps of the Swedish parliament in Stockholm. This year, she became an international celebrity, amassing a plethora of awards and repeatedly making headlines.
This year, her fame peaked with a strikingly antagonistic speech on climate change at the UN General Assembly, in which she accused world leaders of “stealing her childhood and her dreams”. Nevertheless, she narrowly missed this year Nobel Peace Prize, despite being seen as a favourite.
Still, she remains a divisive figure – a hero for some, a puppet for others.
