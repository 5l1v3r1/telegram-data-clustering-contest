If Your Zodiac Sign Is Gemini (May 21 - June 20)


Tina Gong/Bustle

Tina Gong/Bustle

If Your Zodiac Sign Is Aquarius (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18)


Tina Gong/Bustle

The Moon finishes her transit through passionate and seductive Scorpio today, keying up our desires and the need to have exactly what we want or nothing at all. These feelings will be all the more potent by the late morning, when the Moon teams up with love planet Venus in Scorpio.
With the Moon and Venus in Scorpio, we should also find ourselves craving deeper intimacy in our relationships and this planetary combination can help us to find it. However, establishing that intimacy may require vulnerability or facing something that we've been avoiding.
By the afternoon, the Moon teams up with intuitive Mercury in Scorpio, pushing us to have necessary conversations that can help us to suss out the truth, foster healing, or deepen the bond we share with another. If we're engaged in an activity that requires focus, research, and problem-solving skills, this Moon-Mercury combo can help.
By the early evening, the Moon enters happy-go-lucky Sagittarius which should lighten up the vibes and shift us into a good mood. With the Moon in Sagittarius, we'll be in the mood for some good times and adventures.

Here’s your daily horoscope for October 30, 2019, according to 

Mecca Woods

, Bustle’s resident astrologer and creator of 

MyLifeCreated.com

. We’re constantly fascinated by what our zodiac sign says about our lives, whether it's 

which signs are most compatible

 or how each sign handles conflict in relationships. Below, a look at how astrology will affect our lives today.

The Moon is in adventurous and freedom-loving Sagittarius today, putting us in the mood to take a big risk and live life unfiltered. However, with communication planet Mercury scheduled to go retrograde tomorrow in cautious and cunning Scorpio, we're also called to be a little more thoughtful about our decisions.
Plus, with Mercury meeting up with love planet Venus in Scorpio by the evening, we should all be sure to read the fine print when it comes to making or entering contracts or new agreements. At the same time, this Mercury-Venus combo can help us to be more discerning about what we really want rather than settling for a temporary fix or something unsatisfying.
With the Moon in Sagittarius and multiple planets in Scorpio, the focus is on seeing and acknowledging the truth. This may be hard to do when the Moon squares off with hazy Neptune in Pisces, which could confuse things. The best way to use this planetary combo is for anything creative or anything that has meditative benefits.

If Your Zodiac Sign Is Taurus (April 20 - May 20)


Tina Gong/Bustle

A conversation between you and your partner or someone that you're trying to build a rapport with can go well today. However, it will require honesty from both parties. No matter if it's intimacy or money on the line, a clear and honest discussion will bring results. Your word is your bond.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Gemini (May 21 - June 20)


Tina Gong/Bustle

Today, you're reminded that when you give back to others, you receive double what you give (as long as you're not keeping score or giving from a place of depletion or lack). Take this also as a reminder that when you fill your cup, you can then fill the cups of others. Be discerning.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Cancer (June 21 - July 22)


Tina Gong/Bustle

If Your Zodiac Sign Is Sagittarius (Nov. 22 - Dec. 21)


Tina Gong/Bustle

It's all about you and what you're feeling now and if you're not feeling as social or as upbeat as usual, have no fear. You're supposed to be in sleep mode right now, gearing up for your new year (aka your birthday season). That said, have faith that all is coming together. A prayer could be answered.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Capricorn (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19)


Tina Gong/Bustle

Here’s your daily horoscope for October 31, 2019, according to 

Mecca Woods

, Bustle’s resident astrologer and creator of 

MyLifeCreated.com

. We’re constantly fascinated by what our zodiac sign says about our lives, whether it's 

which signs are most compatible

 or how each sign handles conflict in relationships. Below, a look at how astrology will affect our lives today.

It's a big day today ghouls and goblins, not just because the Moon is in bountiful and growth-oriented Sagittarius. It's also Halloween around these parts and the day when communicative Mercury officially begins its retrograde in deep and mysterious Scorpio, which could bring some skeletons out of the closet. However, that doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, as Mercury retrograde in Scorpio is here to help us to get to the bottom of things.
From now until Nov. 20, Mercury retrograde in Scorpio will be pushing us to dive into the depths and retrace our steps, uncovering secrets and other key details or information that we may have missed while Mercury was moving direct.
Between the Moon being in Sagittarius for most of the day and Mercury being in Scorpio, the focus for today (and for the next few weeks) is uncovering and facing the truth. Remember, things become less frightening when we're willing to face them head on. And although Scorpio season can be a time when our fears seem to hold more weight than usual, know that Scorpio also gives us the courage and determination to conquer them.
When the Moon moves to responsible Capricorn by late tonight, the focus will be on paying attention to the facts and making our decisions with caution, care, and personal responsibility. And with Capricorn being a sign that appreciates hard work and commitment, this retrograde will also be good for reevaluating our commitments, reassessing our goals, and refining anything that we've already been working on.
Since Mercury retrograde is a time where the chances for miscommunication, travel delays, and errors in judgement are higher than usual, this isn't an ideal time for starting brand new projects, entering into agreements, or making snap decisions. This is a time for slowing down, assessing the situation, and double-checking facts so our past doesn't come back to haunt us. Of course, if we want to revisit an old haunt or two, this is a good time to do it.
Read below to see what the stars mean for your sign today, and make sure to check out your October 2019 monthly horoscope.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Aries (March 21 - April 19)


Tina Gong/Bustle

Your finances come up for review, but it doesn't have to be scary. See this time as an opportunity to work on paying off debts or handling financial obligations head on so you can build some security for the future. With the focus on your goals, patience and persistence are needed.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Taurus (April 20 - May 20)


Tina Gong/Bustle

An ex or someone from your past could come back from the ""dead"" now, which could help foster a long, overdue conversation or remind you why this person needs to remain a part of your past. Though a reconciliation is possible too. Honor the truth and be bold with it.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Gemini (May 21 - June 20)


Tina Gong/Bustle

OK, let's talk about something that really scares you: slowing down. Yes, Gemini, your task now is to slow way down and reevaluate whether or not everything that's currently on your plate needs to be there. Mistakes can be an issue, so double-check and follow up. Ask for help if needed.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Cancer (June 21 - July 22)


Tina Gong/Bustle

A former flame could come back to haunt you now, but know that you don't have to answer the call or let them back in. Use the power of your better judgement and see this person as they really are. If coupled, this could be a good time to rekindle the magic. Too, revisit a creative project.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Leo (July 23 - Aug. 22)


Tina Gong/Bustle

You might find yourself feeling extra nostalgic now. Understand that if ""ghosts"" from the past disturb you, you're getting the chance to address them so you can move on for good and be free. Talking about something you've been holding on to can help. Reconnecting with family can be a joy.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Virgo (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22)


Tina Gong/Bustle

While you usually know what to say and when to say it, this time asks that you think things through a little longer. Avoid being a zombie, and try to be more mindful about how you go through your day and what you're giving your attention to. Miscommunication can be an issue, so slow down.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Libra (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22)


Tina Gong/Bustle

Money is on your mind now, which means paying more attention to your cash and watching for any expenses or money vampires that may be draining your bank account. Too, you might find yourself wanting to make more cash, which means reevaluating your worth. Ask for more. You deserve.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Scorpio (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21)


Tina Gong/Bustle

While you usually like to keep your thoughts to yourself, this is a time where you're called to seek out ways that you can better communicate to get your needs met and draw boundaries. Also, your words are like spells. Use them to conjure what you want, not what you don't. Affirm the positive.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Sagittarius (Nov. 22 - Dec. 21)


Tina Gong/Bustle

You might feel like you're walking through a house of mirrors now, as things won't seem as clear or cut and dry as you'd like. Try not to fret about this as you're being called to go slow and allow things to unfold on their own rather than rushing to an answer or judgement. You'll get what you need.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Capricorn (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19)


Tina Gong/Bustle

Your friendships and associations come to the forefront today, making it a good time to reconnect with old friends and reevaluate some of the connections you have. If you have one too many energy vampires in your life, now's the chance to address it. Also, let your peeps know what you need.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Aquarius (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18)


Tina Gong/Bustle

Your career and ambitions take center stage, making now the perfect time to reassess your goals and plans. Be mindful of promising more than you can deliver or taking on more than necessary as this will help you to avoid any work related nightmares. Following up, fact-checking, and editing will help you.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Pisces (Feb. 19 - March 20)


Tina Gong/Bustle

Where might you be keeping yourself trapped by self-doubt or fear? Now's the time to take an honest assessment in terms of the outworn beliefs or perceptions that you've been letting get in your way. You have more options than you think. You have more brilliant ideas than you take credit for.

Here’s your daily horoscope for November 1, 2019, according to 

Mecca Woods

MyLifeCreated.com

. We’re constantly fascinated by what our zodiac sign says about our lives, whether it's

 or how each sign handles conflict in relationships. Below, a look at how astrology will affect our lives today.

The Moon remains in pragmatic Capricorn today, putting much of the emphasis on work, productivity, and our ambitions. Considering this lunar placement, we should find ourselves looking to put in the hard work and dedication to achieve success where we want to see success the most in our lives.
The Moon in Capricorn teams up with unconventional Uranus in Taurus at the start of the day which can help us to initiate new projects or take a new approach towards achieving a goal. By the late afternoon, the Moon teams up with the Sun in passionate Scorpio, which can help us to find the determination we need to clear obstacles in our path or overcome a challenge.
Still, the biggest planetary shift of the day occurs later in the afternoon when love planet Venus leaves the depths of Scorpio for happy-go-lucky Sagittarius. With Venus in Sagittarius for the next few weeks, we should find that the people and things that we value most are associated with themes like travel, adventure, generosity, learning and philosophy, and growth.

MyLifeCreated.com

. We’re constantly fascinated by what our zodiac sign says about our lives, whether it's

The Moon is in adventurous and freedom-loving Sagittarius today, putting us in the mood to take a big risk and live life unfiltered. However, with communication planet Mercury scheduled to go retrograde tomorrow in cautious and cunning Scorpio, we're also called to be a little more thoughtful about our decisions.
Plus, with Mercury meeting up with love planet Venus in Scorpio by the evening, we should all be sure to read the fine print when it comes to making or entering contracts or new agreements. At the same time, this Mercury-Venus combo can help us to be more discerning about what we really want rather than settling for a temporary fix or something unsatisfying.
With the Moon in Sagittarius and multiple planets in Scorpio, the focus is on seeing and acknowledging the truth. This may be hard to do when the Moon squares off with hazy Neptune in Pisces, which could confuse things. The best way to use this planetary combo is for anything creative or anything that has meditative benefits.

Here’s your daily horoscope for October 31, 2019, according to 

Mecca Woods

MyLifeCreated.com

. We’re constantly fascinated by what our zodiac sign says about our lives, whether it's 

which signs are most compatible

 or how each sign handles conflict in relationships. Below, a look at how astrology will affect our lives today.

It's a big day today ghouls and goblins, not just because the Moon is in bountiful and growth-oriented Sagittarius. It's also Halloween around these parts and the day when communicative Mercury officially begins its retrograde in deep and mysterious Scorpio, which could bring some skeletons out of the closet. However, that doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, as Mercury retrograde in Scorpio is here to help us to get to the bottom of things.
From now until Nov. 20, Mercury retrograde in Scorpio will be pushing us to dive into the depths and retrace our steps, uncovering secrets and other key details or information that we may have missed while Mercury was moving direct.
Between the Moon being in Sagittarius for most of the day and Mercury being in Scorpio, the focus for today (and for the next few weeks) is uncovering and facing the truth. Remember, things become less frightening when we're willing to face them head on. And although Scorpio season can be a time when our fears seem to hold more weight than usual, know that Scorpio also gives us the courage and determination to conquer them.
When the Moon moves to responsible Capricorn by late tonight, the focus will be on paying attention to the facts and making our decisions with caution, care, and personal responsibility. And with Capricorn being a sign that appreciates hard work and commitment, this retrograde will also be good for reevaluating our commitments, reassessing our goals, and refining anything that we've already been working on.
Since Mercury retrograde is a time where the chances for miscommunication, travel delays, and errors in judgement are higher than usual, this isn't an ideal time for starting brand new projects, entering into agreements, or making snap decisions. This is a time for slowing down, assessing the situation, and double-checking facts so our past doesn't come back to haunt us. Of course, if we want to revisit an old haunt or two, this is a good time to do it.

If Your Zodiac Sign Is Aries (March 21 - April 19)


Tina Gong/Bustle

If Your Zodiac Sign Is Taurus (April 20 - May 20)


Tina Gong/Bustle

An ex or someone from your past could come back from the ""dead"" now, which could help foster a long, overdue conversation or remind you why this person needs to remain a part of your past. Though a reconciliation is possible too. Honor the truth and be bold with it.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Gemini (May 21 - June 20)


Tina Gong/Bustle

OK, let's talk about something that really scares you: slowing down. Yes, Gemini, your task now is to slow way down and reevaluate whether or not everything that's currently on your plate needs to be there. Mistakes can be an issue, so double-check and follow up. Ask for help if needed.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Cancer (June 21 - July 22)


Tina Gong/Bustle

A former flame could come back to haunt you now, but know that you don't have to answer the call or let them back in. Use the power of your better judgement and see this person as they really are. If coupled, this could be a good time to rekindle the magic. Too, revisit a creative project.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Leo (July 23 - Aug. 22)


Tina Gong/Bustle

If Your Zodiac Sign Is Virgo (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22)


Tina Gong/Bustle

While you usually know what to say and when to say it, this time asks that you think things through a little longer. Avoid being a zombie, and try to be more mindful about how you go through your day and what you're giving your attention to. Miscommunication can be an issue, so slow down.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Libra (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22)


Tina Gong/Bustle

Money is on your mind now, which means paying more attention to your cash and watching for any expenses or money vampires that may be draining your bank account. Too, you might find yourself wanting to make more cash, which means reevaluating your worth. Ask for more. You deserve.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Scorpio (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21)


Tina Gong/Bustle

While you usually like to keep your thoughts to yourself, this is a time where you're called to seek out ways that you can better communicate to get your needs met and draw boundaries. Also, your words are like spells. Use them to conjure what you want, not what you don't. Affirm the positive.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Sagittarius (Nov. 22 - Dec. 21)


Tina Gong/Bustle

You might feel like you're walking through a house of mirrors now, as things won't seem as clear or cut and dry as you'd like. Try not to fret about this as you're being called to go slow and allow things to unfold on their own rather than rushing to an answer or judgement. You'll get what you need.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Capricorn (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19)


Tina Gong/Bustle

Your friendships and associations come to the forefront today, making it a good time to reconnect with old friends and reevaluate some of the connections you have. If you have one too many energy vampires in your life, now's the chance to address it. Also, let your peeps know what you need.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Aquarius (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18)


Tina Gong/Bustle

Your career and ambitions take center stage, making now the perfect time to reassess your goals and plans. Be mindful of promising more than you can deliver or taking on more than necessary as this will help you to avoid any work related nightmares. Following up, fact-checking, and editing will help you.
If Your Zodiac Sign Is Pisces (Feb. 19 - March 20)


Tina Gong/Bustle

Where might you be keeping yourself trapped by self-doubt or fear? Now's the time to take an honest assessment in terms of the outworn beliefs or perceptions that you've been letting get in your way. You have more options than you think. You have more brilliant ideas than you take credit for.

MyLifeCreated.com

. We’re constantly fascinated by what our zodiac sign says about our lives, whether it's

 or how each sign handles conflict in relationships. Below, a look at how astrology will affect our lives today.

The Moon remains in pragmatic Capricorn today, putting much of the emphasis on work, productivity, and our ambitions. Considering this lunar placement, we should find ourselves looking to put in the hard work and dedication to achieve success where we want to see success the most in our lives.
The Moon in Capricorn teams up with unconventional Uranus in Taurus at the start of the day which can help us to initiate new projects or take a new approach towards achieving a goal. By the late afternoon, the Moon teams up with the Sun in passionate Scorpio, which can help us to find the determination we need to clear obstacles in our path or overcome a challenge.
Still, the biggest planetary shift of the day occurs later in the afternoon when love planet Venus leaves the depths of Scorpio for happy-go-lucky Sagittarius. With Venus in Sagittarius for the next few weeks, we should find that the people and things that we value most are associated with themes like travel, adventure, generosity, learning and philosophy, and growth.
