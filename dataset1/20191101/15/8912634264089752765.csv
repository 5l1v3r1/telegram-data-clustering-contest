“I’m not a follower of the sport, but I came with my kids who love it, and even as an observer, I can proudly say it was flawless,” he said.“WWE is running for ten more years (in Saudi Arabia), but the amount of dedication and work I’ve seen poured into it the past two years, and without error, it’s tremendous work,” he added.Another new Saudi fan Abdulaziz Al-Anezi, who attended with his young daughter Nora, said: “It was a beautiful evening made possible in our home instead of traveling abroad and going out of our way to see it. All of these wrestling champions came and it was entertaining for both adults and children.” Nora gushed over Natalya’s win in the female fight: “I want to be like her, and I want to see many more women wrestling.”Robin and his son Paulo from the Philippines, who came to the event to cheer for Roman Reigns, said it was an honor to witness the first women match taking place in Saudi Arabia: “It’s history in the making.”
