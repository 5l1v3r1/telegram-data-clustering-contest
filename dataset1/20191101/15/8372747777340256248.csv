01 Nov 2019, 15:26 by Scripps National



INDIO, Cali. – Rage Against the Machine is reuniting after a nine-year hiatus.
Industry sources confirmed the news to both Rolling Stone and Billboard on Friday.
Rolling Stone reports that the American rock band will embark on a brief three show warm-up tour in the southwestern U.S. in March before headlining both weekends of the upcoming Coachella music festival in April.
This won’t be the band’s first appearance at Coachella. They headlined the inaugural festival in 1999 and again played there in 2007.
Speculation surrounding the band’s reunion started on Instagram, where an unverified account posted a list of tour dates with a photo that guitarist Tom Morello posted days earlier. The band has not confirmed the dates and locations in the post.



The band has been on hiatus since 2011 following a series of reunion shows. Since then, members have been working on other projects, including the super group Prophets of Rage.
