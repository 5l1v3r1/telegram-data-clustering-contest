01 Nov 2019, 15:00 by Bijal Panchal
A good night’s sleep is essential for your health. But our current lifestyles are not really designed to encourage healthy sleep habits. There’s the constant hustle, stress, late night work on projects, and unhealthy food and drinking habits. All of these combine to give you consistently poor quality of sleep, an even difficulty falling asleep in the first place.
Research shows that about 60 million Americans suffer from insomnia. And this lack of sleep is the cause of 5% of all cases of obesity in adults.[1] It is also a leading cause for depression and anxiety among adults and teenagers alike.
So how do you avoid all this? How do you make sure you get a good night sleep every night?
Well, the first step is obviously falling asleep and we’ve found just the right thing to help you with that — Tea.
The simple act of boiling certain herbs or flowers in hot water for their calming effects has been around for centuries. Ingredients like chamomile, lavender, and valerian are said to have sedative properties which help the body relax and induces sleep. And even though there is no definitive evidence of the effectiveness of teas, there are a lot of personal accounts where people have found herbal teas to be helpful in falling asleep.
What say you test out that theory for yourself? Here are 7 recipes of the best tea for sleep:
1. The Valerian Tea
This tea is mostly used since ancient times as a sleeping aid. It is well known remedy for insomnia. This tea works by restorative the brain cells to produce more of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a chemical which is responsible for soothing nerves and relieving anxiety.

Benefits of Valerian Tea

Ingredients and Recipe

“It’s very easy to make. Put a teaspoon of valerian root into an infusion tool like a heat seal tea bag. Put the valerian into an empty container and then pour in boiling water and leave the mixture covered for 15 minutes to steep.

Pour eight ounces of water over the tea bag, infuser, or tea leaves.
