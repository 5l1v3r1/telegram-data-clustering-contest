Weezer will be covering ‘Lost In The Woods’, Musgraves ‘All Is Found’ and Panic! At The Disco ‘Into The Unknown’. Those are three of seven new songs by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez – who also wrote the songs from Frozen – that will feature on the soundtrack, per Billboard.
The musicians’ renditions of the songs will play during the end credits of the Frozen sequel, which arrives in theatres November 22, and the soundtrack November 15.
Weezer will release a new album, ‘Van Weezer’, and embark on the Hella Mega Tour with Green Day and Fall Out Boy next year.
