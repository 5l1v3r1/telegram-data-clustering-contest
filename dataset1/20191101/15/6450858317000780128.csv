The best upcoming games of 2019
Here's Tech Advisor's guide to the biggest and best games coming out this year and beyond for PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. These are our most anticipated upcoming game releases.
01 Nov 2019, 15:01 by Hannah Cowton
Though we're now in the last quarter of 2019, there's still a lot to look forward to on the horizon. The likes of Metro Exodus and Devil May Cry 5 have blown us away over the last few months, and we've still got titles such as Pokémon Sword And Shield and Cyberpunk 2077 to come - just to name a few. 
It's exhausting trying to keep up with all the new releases on the way, so we've decided to do the hard work for you and round up all of the biggest and best games on the way this year, next year, and even a few that might be further off than that. We've done our best to include games from across all the main consoles and PC, listed in release date order.
If you'd rather find out about great games that are already actually out, your best bet is to check out our individual guides to the best games on the PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Switch.
Just Dance 2020



Platforms: PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Google Stadia...Nintendo Wii?!Release date: 5 November 2019Pre-order: Amazon UK, Amazon US
Yep, you read that right. Just Dance 2020 is coming to five consoles - including the Nintendo Wii, because YOLO. This iteration includes some recent hot hits like ""God is a Woman"", as well as custom playlists and curated recommendations based on your previous choices. Kids categories are also back - to keep this game family friendly for the little ones. All in all, it's a current version of a classic. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. 
Narcos: Rise Of The Cartels



Platforms: PS4, Xbox OneRelease date: 8 November 2019Pre-order: Amazon UK 
The Netflix hit about the Cartels (that isn't Breaking Bad) is getting its own game. Relieve the first season from two separate points of view, each offering a unique perspective. Whether you build up the drug empire as a narco, or aim to smash it down as the DEA, you're bound to have a whole heap of fun. You'll also be able to choose from a number of character classes, each with their own skillsets. 
We've certainly got high hopes for it - see more in our Narcos: Rise Of The Cartels preview. 
Need For Speed: Heat



;
Platforms: PS4, Xbox OneRelease date: 8 November 2019Pre-order: Amazon UK
Need For Speed is one of those series that feels like it's been going on forever - 25 years in fact. Need For Speed: Heat is the game to celebrate this milestone. In terms of gameplay; during the day you can compete in sanctioned races to help perfect your techniques and rank on the leaderboard. However of a night, you can take to the streets, weaving through traffic and trying to escape the cops on your tail.

Death Stranding



Platforms: PS4Release date: 8 November 2019Pre-order: Amazon UK, Amazon US
We're quite literally a handful of weeks away from Death Stranding being released, and despite numerous trailers and interviews about the game, we're no closer to understanding exactly what Hideo Kojima is creating. We do know that it'll include a host of celebrities including voice acting from Mads Mikkelsen, Norman Redus and Guillermo Del Toro, and that it'll be unlike any game we've ever played.

Pokémon Sword And Shield

Pokémon Sword and Shield will take place in the Galar region, which this year has been modelled after the UK. The current starters confirmed are Scorbunny, Sobble and Grookey (Fire, Water and Grass types respectively). This next generation will also introduce some new features for trainers to use in battle, including The Dynamax Phenomenon, which turns Pokémon gigantic. I mean, who doesn't want that?

WRC 8



Platforms: Nintendo SwitchRelease date: 14 November 2019 (UK), 19 November 2019 (US)Pre-order: Amazon UK and Amazon US
World Championship Racing 8 is now coming to the Nintendo Switch. The game had a huge overhaul when it came to the career mode.

Dynamic weather has also been added to the game, which will make an impact on both the visuals and gameplay. 
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order



Platforms: PS4, Xbox One, PCRelease date: 15 November 2019Pre-order: Amazon UK, Amazon US
It's about time we finally got a single-player, story-focused Star Wars game. This title follows Padawan Cal Kestis, one of the last surviving Jedi post Revenge of the Sith. Cal is on the run from an elite inquisitor - the Second Sister - from the Galactic Empire after using the force to save a friend and a droid witnessed his powers. Along the way Cal will visit some iconic Star Wars locations, including the Wookie planet, Kashyyyk (though no word yet on if we'll get some fun cameos, but we're keeping our lightsabers crossed).

Shenmue III



Platforms: PS4Release date: 19 November 2019Pre-order: GAME
Shenmue III is a very unique case in the video game world. The first two games were released by Sega in 1999 and 2001 respectively. They gained a cult fanbase over time, but the third title got locked in the development stage for a long time. Finally, after launching a crowdfunding campaign, Shenmue III is finally on its way. This combat game follows Ryo Hazuki, who has travelled to China in search of his father's killer, Lan Di.

Iron Man VR



Platforms: PS VRRelease date: 28 February 2020Pre-order: Amazon UK or Amazon US
We've all looked at Tony Stark and thought, 'Man, I wish I had one of those Iron Man suits for myself'. Well, now you can. Iron Man VR is coming to PS VR,  in which you play the billionaire superhero who is facing off against a ghost of his past. You'll be able to use the repulsor jets to shoot and control the flight movement for the suit, and as you progress through the game you'll be able to add on nifty upgrades to make your suit even more advanced. 
Doom Eternal



Platforms: PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, Google StadiaRelease date: March 2020Pre-order: Amazon UK or Amazon US
Following up from the events of 2016's Doom, Doom Eternal looks to offer much of the same - and that's no bad thing. Doom Eternal is the fast-paced, ultra-violent sequel that everyone has been waiting for, and boasts a larger roster of Hellish enemies, more weapons and new mechanics that'll change the way that you play Doom games forever. Oh, and the introduction of a new game mode that puts online players in your single-player campaign as Demons is coming too. Sounds fun, right?

Here's all we know about Doom Eternal so far. 

Final Fantasy VII Remake



Platforms: PS4Release date: 3 March 2020Pre-order: Amazon UK or Amazon US
So, obviously this is a remake of the 1997 game Final Fantasy VII, which follows mercenary Cloud Strife as he, and eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE, battle against the Shinra megacorporation and former Shinra soldier, Sephiroth. But what's different from the original? Well, updated graphics obviously, along with remade character designs, additional quests and a revised combat system. 
Animal Crossing: New Horizons



Platforms: Nintendo SwitchRelease date: 20 March 2020Pre-order: GAME
It'll have been nearly eight years since the last main Animal Crossing once New Horizons is released, so it's no wonder that the internet had a collective meltdown when this was announced (albeit delayed until 2020). You'll be taking part in the Nook Inc. Deserted Island Getaway Package, where you'll be able to craft your own resources, customise your own home and enjoy lots of island-themed activities like fishing and gardening. Also, it looks absolutely adorable, as usual. 
Cyberpunk 2077



Platforms: PS4, Xbox One, PC, Google StadiaRelease date: 16 April 2020Pre-order: Amazon UK or Amazon US
CD Projekt Red is going big with its follow-up to The Witcher trilogy: a massive open-world, first-person, cyberpunk sci-fi game based on a cult tabletop RPG. Known about for years but only revealed for the first time at E3 2018, Cyberpunk looks like one of the most ambitious RPGs ever made, combining dense progression systems, branching narratives, and fast-paced FPS combat into one sprawling whole. Oh yeah, and it features the breathtaking Keanu Reeves. We're ready to move to Night City now, please.

Plus, we'll also be getting the addition of fan favourite Kamala Khan, AKA Ms. Marvel. The developers have also promised that this game will be optimised for more content for the next few years, making this superhero title an investment for gamers all around. 
See more about our thoughts in our article on Marvel's Avengers news and gameplay. 
The Last Of Us Part II



Platforms: PS4Release date: 29 May 2020Pre-order: Amazon UK or Amazon US
The Last Of Us has been considered as one of the greatest video games of all time, so the sequel certainly has a lot to live up to. Set five years after its predecessor, Ellie and Joel have settled down in Jackson, Wyoming, and found peace amongst a small community. However, an event will turn all of this on its head, putting Ellie through a difficult and traumatic journey. With upgraded gameplay, new weapons and a compelling story, we think this is going to be something special.

Dying Light 2



Platforms: PS4, Xbox One, PC Release date: Spring 2020Pre-order: GAME or Gamestop
Dying Light proved to be a pretty great zombie game, and the sequel will only build on this even further. Advancements in the plot, combat gameplay and world should give you everything you need to go out and face the undead. The game will also be getting a Left 4 Dead 2 crossover, including using a guitar as a weapon to slay zombies with - pretty rockin. 
Watch Dogs Legion

One of the most anticipated games of 2020 has unfortunately been delayed until the latter half of the year.

Each character's stats will be influenced by their backstory, and allegedly you'll be able to recruit and play as any NPC in the game.

Gods & Monsters



Platforms: PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, Google StadiaRelease date: 2020Pre-order: GAME
The studio behind the renowned Assassins Creed: Odyssey are coming with a new storybook adventure that's giving us big Zelda vibes. According to the trailer, you'll be on a quest to save some Greek gods, and at some point face off against a big freaky looking bird creature. Other than that, we don't know too much yet. But, we're pretty hopeful that this'll be one to watch. 
Halo Infinite 



Platforms: Xbox One, PC, Xbox Project ScarlettRelease date: Holiday 2020Pre-order: GAME
The first game on this list for the next-gen consoles, Halo Infinite, will mark the return of Master Chief, but also allegedly a spiritual reboot for the entire franchise - which is very intriguing.
