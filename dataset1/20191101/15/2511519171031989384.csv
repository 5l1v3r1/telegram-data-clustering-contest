47 funniest movie taglines of all time
'If you only see one film this year... you need to get out more often'

""In space, no one can hear you scream."" ""The horror, the horror."" ""Be afraid. Be very afraid.""

It's easy to be lured into watching a horror film or indeed a non-serious film because of the tagline on the poster – the above few are an example of that.
That's why it should be respected when a one-sheet manages to catch your attention with a tagline that manages to make you laugh.
This is standard practice for a comedy – a film that's purporting to be funny should really have a hilarious tagline. But there have also been some films – action thrillers, for example – where the studio opts to go down the funny route anyway (see: Bride of Chucky, Predator 2, True Lies).
We've compiled the funniest taglines in film history – click through the below gallery to see what made the list.
