Progress made on China trade except for technology transfers, Kudlow says
01 Nov 2019, 15:11 by Sean Higgins
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Friday that the United States and China were still actively talking on trade and had made progress in most areas except one of the most difficult: forced technology transfers.
""The financial services chapter, where American companies would be able to get to 100% ownership — insurance, security firms, investment banks, commercial banks — that chapter is virtually wrapped up,"" Kudlow told Fox Business. ""The currency stability and manipulation chapter is virtually wrapped up.""
Kudlow added: ""Enormous progress been made on the intellectual property theft issue. That one is not completed, but there is lots of progress. On forced transfer of technology, there has been some progress, but that will probably slip into phase two.""
The next round of trade negotiations with China was thrown into chaos when Chile canceled the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation event set for November at which President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were scheduled to meet. Kudlow said both sides were currently talking on trying to find an alternate location.
