Donald and Melania Trump have filed for residency in Palm Beach, according to documents obtained by the New York Times

The lifelong New Yorker has officially become a Florida man. Donald Trump has changed his primary residence from Manhattan to Mar-a-Lago – the exclusive golf club that he has referred to as the “winter White House”.
“I cherish New York,” Trump said in a tweet on Thursday. But, he said, “despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state.”



In September, Donald and Melania Trump filed for residency in Palm Beach, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.
“If I maintain another place or places of abode in some other state or states, I hereby declare that my above-described residence and abode in the State of Florida constitutes my predominant and principal home, and I intend to continue it permanently as such,” reads the “declaration of domicile” Trump filed.
His other “place or places of abode” include 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue – the White House – and his private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Trump Tower in Manhattan has been Trump’s primary residence since 1983, but he has spent little time there since becoming president. According to NBC News, Trump has spent 99 days at Mar-a-Lago and only 20 days at Trump Tower since taking office.
Residency in Florida could bring tax benefits because it does not have a state income tax or inheritance tax.
Trump remains unpopular in his home state, and has expressed frustrations at the Manhattan district attorney’s subpoena seeking the president’s tax returns.



Andrew Cuomo, the New York governor, said in a tweet: “Good riddance.”
“He’s all yours, Florida,” Cuomo said.
