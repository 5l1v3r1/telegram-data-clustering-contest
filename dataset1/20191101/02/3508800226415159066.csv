831民調：香港人信唔信「警察有打死人」？

我們想讓你知道的是當然，有多少人相信一件事，和那件事本身是不是事實，沒有必然關係。但當一件事有足夠多的人相信，就會帶來如同真實的後果。

今日是831太子站警察襲擊兩個月，這段時間社會對站內到底有沒有死人有各種說法。指控到目前仍未獲普遍確定，但不少人視之為真確並不停到站口悼念，又到附近的旺角警署表達不滿。警察方面，過去兩個月來多次否認這些指控（雖然其輕挑態度實在令人搖頭嘆息）。
獲得網民的投票支持，有關831事件的提問在香港民意研究所的「我們香港人」計劃當中突圍而出，成為正式的民意調查題目，於10月24日至28日期間訪問了1026名香港人是否相信當日真的有死人。
無獨有偶，中文大學方面也在十月初就相同題目提問。難得有兩個獨立的民意調查機構就同一題目設問，我特別向中大方面取得相關的詳細數據，並和香港民意研究所的數據作比較。在此特別鳴謝中大傳播與民意調查中心的分享。



事先聲明，兩個調查機構的提問用字、提供的選擇，和調查的日期也有分別；例如香港民意研究所方面容許回答「一半半」，中大那邊就沒有。雖然如此，兩個調查的結果十分相似：認同有死人的大約佔一半，不認同的大約佔三成。
（中大的結果看起來好像沒有香港民意研究所的極端，可能的理由是中大的用字是「絕對真確」，香港民意研究所的用字是「好贊成」，前者本身就極端一點。）
這個結果並不意外。有關警察信任度的調查顯示，有一半市民對警察「零信任」，那麼針對警察的極嚴重指控有一半市民相信也屬可以預期。
當然，有多少人相信一件事，和那件事本身是不是事實，沒有必然關係。但當一件事有足夠多的人相信，就會帶來如同真實的後果（例如如果有足夠多的人相信銀行擠提，那麼銀行就真的會擠提）。當有一半市民相信對香港警察犯了極嚴重的過錯而沒有承認，對政府管治已會帶來無可挽回的打擊。
除了831之外，中大那邊還另外問了兩個媒體常見的指控：新屋嶺性侵犯和示威者性服務。



對於新屋嶺警察性侵犯被捕者的指控，一樣有過半市民認為真確，而認為絕對真確的更有23%，比認為831有死人是絕對真確的明顯更多。
至於聲稱有女性示威者被誘使向男性示威者提供性服務的指控，絕大多數市民都不相信，認為絕對真實和應該真實的加起來才只有一成。
中大數據最有趣的地方，是他們就這三條問題作出了進一步的分析，比較運動參與者（最少參與一場示威），不信任政府的非運動參與者（對警察和政府的信任度平均低於一半），以及信任政府的非運動參與者（對警察和政府的信任度平均高於一半），再看看他們的回答有沒有分別。









從頭兩條問題中可以看到，運動參與者和不信任政府的非運動參與者的回應是相似的，其中運動參與者對警察的質疑還要大一些。另一方面，信任政府的非運動參與者則有如活在平行時空一樣，一面倒的相信警察的說法（不過仍有一成信任政府的非運動參與者認為831有死人，是個挺奇怪的回應）。
再重申一次，民意調查本身不能取代真相。不過，當民意調查顯示香港社會對於極為嚴重的指控出現了如此不同的理解，釐清事實對緩解社會衝突實在是刻不容緩。法定獨立調查的要求，在此在顯得十分合理。
最後，提一提示威者性服務這一條。就算信任政府的非運動參與者也是過六成覺得是假的。麻煩那些還在推這些指控的政治人物自己想想，為什麼他們連他們的潛在支持者也說服不了。

831 poll: Hong Kong people believe in ""the police have killed people""?
01 Nov 2019, 02:58 by Featured Reprint


What we want you to know is, of course, how many people believe in one thing, and whether the matter itself is a fact or not. But when there is enough people to believe in one thing, it will bring about real consequences.



(Article published on October 31)
Text: Liang Qizhi
Today is the police attack of the 831 Prince Edward station for two months. During this time, the society has various opinions on whether there are any dead people in the station. The accusation has not yet been generally determined, but many people regard it as being true and do not stop at the station, and express dissatisfaction at the nearby Mong Kok Police Station. On the police side, these allegations have been denied many times in the past two months (although their light-hearted attitude is really sighing).
With the support of the netizens, the question about the 831 incident broke out in the ""Our Hong Kong People"" project of the Hong Kong Institute of Public Opinion and became the official opinion poll. It visited 1026 Hong Kong people from October 24 to 28. Do you believe that there are really dead people on that day.
Coincidentally, the Chinese University also asked questions on the same topic in early October. It is rare for two independent polling agencies to ask questions on the same topic. I have obtained detailed data from the CUHK and compare it with the data of the Hong Kong Institute of Public Opinion. I would like to express my special thanks to the sharing of the China University of Communications and the Public Opinion Survey Center.



It is stated in advance that there are also differences in the wording of the questions, the choices offered, and the dates of the surveys; for example, the Hong Kong Institute of Public Opinions allows for ""half and a half"" answers, and there is no such thing as CUHK. Nonetheless, the results of the two surveys are very similar: about half of the people who agree with the dead, and about 30% who don't agree.
(The result of the CUHK seems to be the extreme of the Hong Kong Institute of Public Opinion. The possible reason is that the word used by CUHK is ""absolutely true"". The word used by the Hong Kong Institute of Public Opinion is ""good for"". The former is extremely extreme. )
This result is not unexpected. A survey on police trust shows that half of the public have ""zero trust"" in the police, and half of the people who are extremely serious against the police believe that it is also predictable.
Of course, how many people believe in one thing, and whether the matter itself is a fact, is not necessarily related. But when there are enough people to believe in one thing, it will bring about real consequences (for example, if there are enough people who believe in bank squeeze, then the bank will really squeeze). When half of the people believed that they had committed a very serious fault to the Hong Kong police and did not recognize it, it would have an irreparable impact on government governance.
In addition to 831, Zhongda also asked two common allegations in the media: sexual violence in Xinwuling and demonstrator sexual services.



As for the allegations of the Sham Ukrainian police who have sexually assaulted the arrested persons, more than half of the people think that they are true, and that 23% are absolutely true, which is obviously more than that of the 831 dead.
As for the allegations that female demonstrators were lured to provide sexual services to male demonstrators, the vast majority of the public did not believe that only 10% of the totals were absolutely true and should be true.
The most interesting part of the CUHK data is that they have made further analysis on these three issues, comparing the participants in the movement (at least participating in a demonstration) and not trusting the non-athletic participants of the government (the trust in the police and the government is on average lower than Half), as well as non-sports participants who trust the government (on average for trust between the police and the government), and then see if their responses are different.









As can be seen from the first two questions, the responses of the participants in the movement and the non-athletic participants who do not trust the government are similar, and the participants in the movement question the police more. On the other hand, non-sports participants who trust the government are like living in parallel time and space, and believe in the police on the one hand (although there are still 10% of non-athletic participants who trust the government think that 831 has a dead person, which is a very strange response).
Once again, opinion polls alone cannot replace the truth. However, when opinion polls show that Hong Kong society has such a different understanding of the extremely serious allegations, it is imperative to clarify the facts to alleviate social conflicts. The requirements of a statutory independent investigation are very reasonable here.
Finally, mention a tip to the sexual service. Even if the non-sports participants who trust the government are over 60%, they feel that they are fake. Troublesome politicians who are still pushing these allegations think about themselves, why they can't even convince their potential supporters.
