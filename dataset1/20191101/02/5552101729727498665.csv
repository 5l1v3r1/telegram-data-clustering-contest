網美顏值口味也是硬底子　美滋鍋派專人剝蝦被圈粉
01 Nov 2019, 02:57 by 林嘉琪, 李明宜, 何宗昇
「新加坡樂天餐飲集團」旗下潮牌火鍋「美滋鍋」旋風般抵台。六大湯底「膠原蛋白養顏美容鍋」「滋補養生香辣鍋」「養生藥膳醉雞鍋」「清涼解熱雪耳椰子鍋」「維他命C蕃茄玉米鍋」「松茸野菌鍋」讓人選擇困難症發作；還有專人代客剝蝦，現在想吃蝦不用tag男友，我就遇到有女客人感慨又驚喜地說：「這輩子都還沒有人為我剝過蝦.....」愛吃鍋的來了一秒變公主，沒那麼愛吃鍋的吃了一秒被圈粉。
美滋鍋台灣首店進軍台北信義區的鍋物一級戰區，菜單上讓人彷彿「吃了會變美」的美名湯底和粉紅、亮銀色的用餐空間，成了網美朝聖的明星鍋物店，但是可別因為萌萌的空間和融化人心的服務就誤會她只有美型，這位鍋物界明星在風味和食材上可是硬底子。


想吃蝦不用tag男友，這裡的專人剝蝦服務，讓客人一秒當公主。



網美鍋物店處處網美成群。



萌萌粉紅熊是鎮店吉祥物，坐鎮入口處迎接客人。

台灣樂天執行董事劉素華在展店前來回奔波新加坡和台灣，「除了確認越洋後的湯底風味穩定，其實台灣的蔬菜、肉類及海鮮品質更勝新加坡，吃來更過癮。」她一手把關用真食材精燉的湯底絕對不能花拳繡腿。
像是「膠原蛋白養顏美容鍋」要燉煮8小時到白湯會黏嘴 ；「維他命C蕃茄玉米鍋」得花4小時翻炒牛番茄，再加甜玉米、聖女番茄再熬煮。多款湯底的醇厚風味全憑時間醞釀而成。


「生猛龍蝦綜合拼盤」鮮燙的大鉗肉吃來暢快。（2,500元／份）



「清涼解熱雪耳椰子鍋」清甜好好喝。



「牽腸掛肚綜合拼盤」迷倒內臟控。（280元／份）



油脂夠肥的「西班牙伊比利豬五花肉」耐煮不柴。（400元／份）

火鍋料則講究技法功力，「好吃魚丸的標準是要有濃厚的魚鮮味、質地滑潤、咬下清脆和色澤晶亮。」美滋鍋廚師長石凌合本來是潮汕料理師傅，最擅長手工製作魚丸餃滑，他選了海鰱、鱈魚、豆腐鯊、雙髻鯊、魴魚等十幾款魚類測試多次，最後相中肥厚飽滿、含脂量高的紅魽魚來做魚造型的「自製魚豆腐」，成了最吸睛的火鍋料。


魚型「美滋鍋自製魚豆腐」彈滑甜嫰，功夫不凡。（60元／尾）



「招牌炸響鈴 」蘸3秒「滋補養生香辣鍋」快狠準入口，這才叫老饕吃法。（230元／份）



星馬名物「酥炸魚皮」，單吃或蘸辣鍋都可口。（240元／份）



用海蝦仁手打的「魚子蝦滑」，口感十足。（360元／份）

造訪過多家位在新加坡美滋鍋和台灣首店，我歸納出來此點菜的策略－不同於在一般鍋物店選吃頂級肉品或海鮮，由於這裡的湯底、手工鍋料很用心，每一口的完整度都像一道料理，所以來了就要放膽點「招牌炸響鈴 」、星馬名物「酥炸魚皮」，許多人不愛吃的餃滑類火鍋料，來這裡都建議試試看，說不定會跟我一樣發現鍋物新大陸。

「美滋鍋」是鍋物界網美。

Net beauty value taste is also a hard foundation.
01 Nov 2019, 02:57 by Lin Jiaqi, Li Mingyi, He Zongsheng
The sleek hot pot ""Mei Shi Pot"" under the ""Singapore Lotte Restaurant Group"" arrived in Taiwan in a whirlwind. Six soup base ""collagen beauty beauty pot"" ""nourishing health spicy pot"" ""health medicine drunk chicken pot"" ""cooling antipyretic snow ear coconut pot"" ""vitamin C tomato corn pot"" ""松松野菌锅"" makes people choose difficult There is also a special person to peel the shrimp on behalf of the customer, now want to eat shrimp without tag boyfriend, I met a female guest and said with surprise: ""I haven't peeled the shrimp for me in this life....."" The pot came to change the princess for a second, not so much to eat the pot to eat for a second was circled.
The first store in the US yaki pot entered the pot-class theater in the Xinyi District of Taipei. The menu on the menu made people feel like ""eat it will become beautiful"" and the pink and bright silver dining space became the star pot shop of the net pilgrimage. But don't be misunderstood because of the cute space and the melting of the human service, she is only beautiful, the pottery star is hard on the flavor and ingredients.


Want to eat shrimp without tag boyfriend, here the special person to peel the shrimp service, let the guest a second as a princess.



Net beauty pot store is everywhere in the United States.



Meng Meng Pink Bear is the mascot of the town shop, greet guests at the entrance of the town.

Taiwan’s Lotte Executive Director Liu Suhua traveled back and forth between Singapore and Taiwan in front of the exhibition. “In addition to confirming the stable flavor of the soup at the end of the ocean, Taiwan’s vegetables, meat and seafood are better than Singapore, and they are more enjoyable.” She used it in one hand. The soup base that is really stewed with real ingredients must not be used to embroider the legs.
For example, the ""collagen beauty pot"" should be stewed for 8 hours until the white soup will stick; ""vitamin C tomato corn pot"" takes 4 hours to stir the beef tomato, and then add sweet corn, saint tomato and cook. The mellow flavours of the various soup bases are brewed over time.


""Big lobster integrated platter"" fresh tongs meat is easy to eat. (2,500 yuan / share)



""Clean and refreshing snow fungus coconut pot"" is sweet and delicious.



""Integrated platter"" is fascinated by internal organs. (280 yuan / share)



The ""Iberian pig pork belly"" with fat and fat is resistant to cooking. (400 yuan / share)

Hot pot ingredients pay attention to the skill and skill. ""The standard of delicious fish balls is to have a strong fish flavor, smooth texture, crispy bite and bright color."" The chef of Shizi Pan Shi Ling is originally a chef of Chaoshan cuisine, he is best at handicrafts. He made fish balls and dumplings. He selected dozens of fish such as sea bream, squid, tofu shark, hammerhead shark and squid for many times. Finally, he was rich in fat and full of red squid with high fat content. The ""home-made fish tofu"" has become the most eye-catching hot pot.


The fish-shaped ""Mei Bean Homemade Fish Tofu"" is smooth and tender, and it is very hard. (60 yuan / tail)



""Signature fried bells"" 蘸 3 seconds ""Nutritious health spicy pot"" is fast access to the entrance, this is called the old man to eat. (230 yuan / share)



Star horse famous ""Crispy Fish Skin"", delicious or spicy. (240 yuan / share)



The caviar and shrimp that are hit with the hand of the sea shrimp are full of mouthfeel. (360 yuan / share)

Visiting many homes in Singapore's Meiji Pan and Taiwan's first store, I came up with the strategy of ordering this dish - unlike the choice of top meat or seafood in the general pot shop, because the soup base and handmade pot ingredients are very hard, every The integrity of a bite is like a dish, so when you come, you have to be bold, ""Signature fried bells"", Xingma famous things ""fried fish skin"", many people do not like to eat dumplings hot pot materials, come here are recommended to try If you look at it, maybe you will find the pot new continent like me.


Liu Suhua, executive director of Taiwan Lotte, built the first pink pot store in Taiwan.



The chef of Shimizu Shilin is good at tidal dishes, especially the ingredients of dumplings.



""Meiji"" is the beauty of the pot industry.
