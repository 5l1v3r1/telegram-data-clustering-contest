Yang Yulin and Li Ronghao have been in love for 4 years, and they have achieved positive results. After the marriage, they have climbed the peak. Yang Yulin’s reaction to being asked to marry was very big, “screaming, exclaiming, and then crying,” and admitted that marriage was the most courageous decision.
Yang Ronglin’s four-year-old boyfriend Li Ronghao proposed to her on her 34th birthday. When she was interviewed by Marie Claire, Yang Lanlin recalled the day of the marriage proposal. “I really didn’t think that there was no omen. This day is better than me. Imagine a lot in the early days, I even think that there may never be a marriage contract, just keep going with this person."" She said that she does not feel that she must have children, nor that marriage is a goal that life must pursue.

Li Ronghao planned a romantic proposal on the island trip, Yang Lanlin shouted, she was really super accident. ""I thought the process lasted for ten minutes, but because of the video recording of my friends, I found out that it was within 3 minutes."" I even revealed that ""I never thought that my reaction would be so intense."" Yang Yulin said, I was asked to marry. The reaction was very big, screaming, exclaiming, and then crying, completely unexpected. Because I am usually a very calm person, I did not expect this day to be so excited.
Talking about her husband, Yang Lanlin, said more sweetly, ""I don't find his shortcomings. People must have shortcomings, of course, but his shortcomings are very small things in my eyes."" She admits that marriage is the most courageous decision. ""But I don't know if there are any more brave things in the future. I think maybe I have a baby.""
