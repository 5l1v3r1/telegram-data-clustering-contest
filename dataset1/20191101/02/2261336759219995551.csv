UFC 244 video: Embedded, part 3 - ‘Somebody’s going to sleep for a while’
01 Nov 2019, 02:27 by Tim Burke



UFC 244 is almost here, and as usual, Embedded is here as well. The show that gives you an inside look at the marquee contestants on PPVs has issued the third episode for this weekend’s big show in the The Big Apple, and it serves as a brief introduction to the fighters at the top of the card.
Watch ‘UFC 244 - ‘MASVIDAL VS DIAZ’ Stream all the fights broadcast LIVE — don’t miss a single second of face-punching action! Plus, you get access to the best of the UFC Archives & more! GET THE FIGHTS!
We start things off with Kelvin Gastelum, who is ready to go. He’s sitting with his manager, who sets up a FaceTime conversation between Gastelum and lightweight champ Khabib Nurmagomedov.
Corey Anderson says he trains down the street at Renzo Gracie’s and he’s prepared. Johnny Walker talks to the supplement people. An employee explains the supplement process, saying it’s a little different on fight week.
Stephen Thompson is excited to fight. Gastelum does some media, talking about opponent Darren Till coming up in weight like he did. Over at ESPN Studios, Jorge Masvidal is greeted by Jalen Rose. He discusses the Nate Diaz fight with host Mike Greenberg. Greenberg seems surprised by Masvidal’s charisma. On First Take, the host compares him to Roberto Duran, which Gamebred loves.

Now it’s Diaz time. He makes his first appearance in this Embedded series, talking about why he took the Masvidal fight. He then signs some posters and talks to anti-drug czar Jeff Novitzky. Apparently they’re all good. He says he got teased about wearing his hat sideways, but he’s been doing that the same way since he was a teenager. He then tells an amusing story about throwing bananas at a house.
And that’s it! UFC 244 goes down this Saturday night in NYC.
