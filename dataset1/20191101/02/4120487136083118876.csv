01 Nov 2019, 02:51

【新浪体育31日讯】关于国际奥委会（IOC）作为2020年东京奥运会酷暑对策将马拉松和竞走比赛改在札幌市举行的计划，东京都知事小池百合子30日再次表示无法接受称，“作为主办城市的首长、作为都民的代表，希望在东京举办”。东京都与IOC协调委员会、奥组委等的联席会议于当天开始，小池在会议开头的致辞中作出上述表示。会议为期3天。把地点变更作为已决定事项的IOC协调委员会主席科茨称“不达成协议就不打算离开日本”，提议举行IOC、东京都、奥组委、日本政府四方参加的工作磋商。据称正在协调拟在会议最后一天的11月1日举行四方首脑会谈，小池接受媒体采访时表示：“由于是进行最终磋商的场合，我愿出席。”科茨在25日与小池的会谈中强烈主张变更的正当性，而后转变态度称“（为东京奥运）进行了大量准备，这都是由于东京各位的努力，我将向东京的人们充分解释”等，表示考虑细致地谋求理解。IOC和奥组委力争尽快取得东京都的谅解，转向具体计划的制定，包括确定起点与终点在内的路线等，但预计将遇阻。
