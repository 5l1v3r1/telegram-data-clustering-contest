反送中嚇壞權貴 傳賈慶林雇飛機轉移香港財產

01 Nov 2019, 02:20

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】香港作為中共權貴階層洗錢、走資的要地，自反送中運動以來，大量資金外逃，已經重挫香港經濟。消息人士披露，中共江派也在加速轉移在港資金，轉移到柬埔寨、新加坡等地，其中江派前常委賈慶林，雇了一架私人飛機把在港財產轉移到柬埔寨。
香港是亞洲的現代化國際金融、服務業及航運中心，連續20多年蟬聯全球最自由經濟體。它位於南海北岸，以及珠江口東側，北接廣東省深圳市，自香港主權移交北京後，香港就成了中共權貴階層洗錢的基地。
台灣總體經濟學家吳嘉隆10月29日接受大紀元採訪時說，自香港反送中運動以來，香港資本已經開始不斷地外逃，中共江派那邊也在轉移資金，轉移到柬埔寨、新加坡等地，柬埔寨的錢就是江派的人轉去的。
吳嘉隆披露：中共前全國政協主席賈慶林雇了一架私人飛機，聽說飛機上裝了黃金、美元、歐元等等，飛到柬埔寨去了，這是一個台商跟他講的。
賈慶林之所以把錢轉到柬埔寨，吳嘉隆說，近年來大量中國人進到柬埔寨，可能給了柬埔寨當局一些好處，所以柬埔寨政府也替這些中國人宣傳，教育當地老百姓習慣大量中國人進來。
賈慶林被曝雇私人飛機將財產運出香港，似乎並非空穴來風。早在2013年開始，陸續曝光的「巴拿馬文件」顯示，賈慶林的家族，他的女兒賈薔、女婿李伯潭及外孫女李紫丹均持有香港身份證，且在香港從事各種商業活動。

2016年4月泄漏的「巴拿馬文件」除了起底賈慶林的女婿及外孫女擁有香港身分證之外，還披露中共政治局常委張高麗女兒張曉燕、中共政治局常委劉雲山兒媳婦賈立青等人的家族成員也擁有香港身分證。
張高麗的女兒張曉燕近年在港掃貨，與丈夫李聖潑狂掃逾20幢元朗加州花園及加州豪園洋房，連同其它物業總資產值近8.6億港元；江澤民的長孫江志成把5千億美元洗到國外，而江志成開辦的公司博裕資本，就設立在香港。
「巴拿馬文件」稱，賈慶林的女婿李伯潭、外孫女李紫丹還設立了多間離岸公司，而賈慶林的女兒賈薔（化名，林青）在香港從事各種商業活動。
根據調查資料發現，李伯潭90年代初在港開設的幾間公司，股東及董事名單中都會出現Lam Ching Joanna，即林青，且二人報住地址相同。李伯潭的公司當時就斥資數億在香港買樓，投資物業包括住宅、寫字樓及店鋪，其家族之富有可見一斑。
李伯潭夫婦90年代中期先報住居於置富花園，及後轉到淺水灣分層單位居住。此外，倆人共同持有的怡東投資有限公司，在1993年12月購入力寶中心寫字樓單位，7個月後轉手，狂賺2000萬元（港幣，下同）。
李伯潭與林青的女兒、時年23歲的李紫丹，當時以3.87億元購入東半山傲璇，震驚全港。「巴拿馬文件」顯示，李紫丹就讀大學期間已坐擁兩間離岸公司。
而賈慶林的妻子林幼芳則很早就活躍於港澳商壇，90年代初林幼芳即夥同同鄉、澳門商人顏延齡合組外貿公司，出口成衣、電子等製品，後來業務足跡也涉及香港。兩人分別於1994及1996年合夥成立「寶盛投資（香港）有限公司」及「悉尼經貿中心（香港）有限公司」等。
賈慶林夫婦還涉嫌轟動中外的遠華案。遠華案被稱為中共建政史上的「第一大走私案」。從1996年到案發，遠華集團從事走私犯罪活動達5年之久，涉款830億元。
遠華走私案主犯賴昌星曾在加拿大披露，當時，他得到江澤民大祕賈廷安及時任福建省委書記賈慶林等支持，才能走私大量石油、私家車等戰略物資。
在江澤民的庇護下，賈慶林不僅沒有因為遠華案被查，卻步步高升，2002年被江塞入中共政治局成為常委，2003年至2013年連任中共政協主席。但遠華案始終是賈慶林永遠揮之不去的陰影。
另據海外「追查迫害法輪功國際組織」通報，賈慶林是江澤民迫害法輪功的主要幫凶，嚴重觸犯了群體滅絕罪、酷刑罪、反人類罪。賈慶林、江澤民、羅干、薄熙來和吳官正5人，還曾於2009年11月，在西班牙國家法庭被起訴，罪名是群體滅絕罪和酷刑罪。

In the anti-delivery, the power is scared. Jia Qinglin hired a plane to transfer Hong Kong property.

01 Nov 2019, 02:20

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 01, 2019] Hong Kong, as a land of money laundering and capital of the CCP's privileged class, has plunged Hong Kong's economy since the reversal of the China Movement. According to sources, the Chinese Communist Party is also accelerating the transfer of funds in Hong Kong to Cambodia, Singapore and other places. Among them, Jiang Qinglin, a former member of the Jiang faction, hired a private jet to transfer property in Hong Kong to Cambodia.
Hong Kong is Asia's modern international financial, service and shipping center, and has been the world's freest economy for more than 20 years. It is located on the north bank of the South China Sea, and on the east side of the Pearl River Estuary. It is connected to Shenzhen, Guangdong Province in the north. After Hong Kong's sovereignty was transferred to Beijing, Hong Kong became the base for money laundering by the CCP.
Taiwan’s general economist Wu Jialong said in an interview with the Epoch Times on October 29 that since Hong Kong’s anti-delivery campaign, Hong Kong’s capital has begun to flee, and the Chinese Communist Party’s side has also transferred funds to Cambodia and Singapore. The money in Cambodia is the transfer of the Jiang faction.
Wu Jialong disclosed: Jia Qinglin, former chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, hired a private jet. He heard that the plane was loaded with gold, dollars, euros, etc. and flew to Cambodia. This is what a Taiwanese businessman told him.
The reason why Jia Qinglin transferred the money to Cambodia, Wu Jialong said that in recent years, a large number of Chinese people have entered Cambodia, which may have given the Cambodian authorities some benefits. Therefore, the Cambodian government has also promoted these Chinese people to educate the local people to get used to a large number of Chinese people.
It seems that Jia Qinglin was hired by a private jet to transport his property out of Hong Kong. As early as 2013, the ""Panama Document"" revealed that Jia Qinglin's family, his daughter Jia Wei, son-in-law Li Botan and granddaughter Li Zidan all hold Hong Kong identity cards and engage in various commercial activities in Hong Kong.


At the beginning of the ""Panama Document"", Jia Qinglin's son-in-law Li Botan and her granddaughter Li Zidan set up a number of offshore companies, and Jia Qinglin's daughter, Jia Yuhua, was named Lin Qing in various commercial activities in Hong Kong. (web screenshot)

In addition to the Hong Kong identity card issued by Ms. Jia Qinglin’s son-in-law and granddaughter, the “Panama Document” leaked in April 2016 also revealed the family members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhang Xiaoyan, and the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the CPC, Liu Yunshan’s wife, Jia Liqing and others. Also has a Hong Kong identity card.
Zhang Gaoli’s daughter, Zhang Xiaoyan, has been sweeping goods in Hong Kong in recent years, and her husband Li Sheng has swept more than 20 Yuen Long California Garden and California Haoyuan Bungalows, together with the total assets of other properties worth nearly 860 million Hong Kong dollars; Jiang Zemin’s Chang Sun Jiang Zhicheng put 500 billion The US dollar was washed abroad, and the company Bo Yu Capital, which was founded by Jiang Zhicheng, was established in Hong Kong.
According to the ""Panama Document"", Jia Qinglin's son-in-law Li Botan and her granddaughter Li Zidan also set up a number of offshore companies, and Jia Qinglin's daughter Jia Wei (a pseudonym, Lin Qing) is engaged in various commercial activities in Hong Kong.
According to the survey data, Li Botan’s several companies opened in Hong Kong in the early 1990s, Lam Ching Joanna, Lin Qing, will appear in the list of shareholders and directors, and the two will report the same address. Li Botan’s company spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying houses in Hong Kong. The investment properties include residential, office buildings and shops. The wealth of the family is evident.
Li Boxan and his wife first reported to live in the Fortune Garden in the mid-1990s, and then moved to the shallow water bay tiered unit to live. In addition, Yidong Investment Co., Ltd., jointly owned by the two companies, purchased the office unit of Lippo Center in December 1993 and changed hands after 7 months, earning 20 million yuan (HKD, the same below).
Li Botan and Lin Qing’s daughter, 23-year-old Li Zidan, bought the Eastern Mid-Levels for 387 million yuan and shocked the whole territory. The ""Panama Document"" shows that Li Zidan has been sitting on two offshore companies during his college years.
Jia Qinglin's wife, Lin Youfang, was active in the Hong Kong and Macau business circles very early. In the early 1990s, Lin Youfang and his fellow countrymen and Macao businessman Yan Yanling joined a group of foreign trade companies to export garments, electronics and other products. Later, their business footprint also involved Hong Kong. In 1994 and 1996, the two partners jointly established ""Baosheng Investment (Hong Kong) Limited"" and ""Sydney Economic and Trade Centre (Hong Kong) Limited"".
Jia Qinglin and his wife are also suspected of sensational Chinese and foreign Yuanhua cases. The Yuanhua case is known as the ""first smuggling case"" in the history of the Chinese Communist Party. From 1996 to the incident, Yuanhua Group engaged in smuggling criminal activities for five years, involving 83 billion yuan.
Lai Changxing, the principal of the Yuanhua smuggling case, disclosed in Canada that at that time, he was supported by Jiang Zemin’s great secretary, Jia Ting’an, as the secretary of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee, Jia Qinglin, in order to smuggle a large amount of strategic materials such as oil and private cars.
Under the protection of Jiang Zemin, Jia Qinglin was not only not investigated because of the Yuanhua case, but was step by step. In 2002, he was admitted to the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China and became a standing committee member. From 2003 to 2013, he was re-elected as chairman of the CPPCC. However, the Yuanhua case has always been the shadow of Jia Qinglin’s lingering forever.
According to the overseas ""Tracing the Persecution of Falun Gong International Organization"", Jia Qinglin is the main accomplice of Jiang Zemin's persecution of Falun Gong. He has seriously violated the crime of mass extermination, the crime of torture and crimes against humanity. Jia Qinglin, Jiang Zemin, Luo Gan, Bo Xilai and Wu Guanzheng were also charged in November 2009 in the Spanish National Court on charges of genocide and torture.
