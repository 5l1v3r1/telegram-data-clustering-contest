Video: Cain Velasquez taps out to Brock Lesnar kimura at WWE Crown Jewel
01 Nov 2019, 02:00 by Tim Burke
Former UFC heavyweight champions Brock Lesnar and Cain Velasquez met each other again today in Saudi Arabia, and the results were very different than their UFC 121 fight back in 2010. This wasn’t exactly the same thing though, since the two men did not face off in the Octagon this time. Instead, it was WWE’s squared circle.
Lesnar, the current WWE Universal champion, engaged with pro wrestling newcomer Velasquez at WWE Crown Jewel in a match that tried to look as much as possible like a real fight. It succeeded to a degree, but Cain’s inexperience was quite obvious as they only went a little under five minutes.
Things started with Cain landing a barrage of strikes, then dropping Lesnar with a head kick. But Lesnar quickly adjusted and secured a MMA-style kimura lock, which is something the veteran performer has used as a finishing move often in the past for pro wrestling matches. Cain ended up tapping out to it, leaving Lesnar as the champ. He then attacked Velasquez with a chair, but was ran off by Cain’s friend Rey Mysterio.
Here’s some video of the “fight”, courtesy of WWE’s Twitter.









Also of note for combat spots fans, boxing champion Tyson Fury looked pretty good in his first pro wrestling match, defeating big man Braun Strowman. He threw a dropkick, did some other athletic things, and ended up winning by countout when he landed a knockout punch on Strowman while he was on the apron. Let’s just say this was much better than it had any right to be, and was miles better than Lesnar/Velasquez.
