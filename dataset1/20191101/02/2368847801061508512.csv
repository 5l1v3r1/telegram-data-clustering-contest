組圖：萬聖夜狂歡反送中 港人蘭桂坊「哈囉餵狗官」

01 Nov 2019, 02:29

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】10月31日萬聖夜，香港市民舉行「哈囉餵狗官面具夜」抗議活動。市民們有的戴著中港高官的頭像面具，或裝扮成各種造型，遊行到聞名世界的中環蘭桂坊酒吧街，舉行狂歡反送中派對，抗議港府強推的《禁蒙面法》，並繼續表達五大訴求。
晚7點多鐘，大批香港市民戴著面具從銅鑼灣維多利亞公園一路遊行至中環蘭桂坊，民眾沿路不停高喊「五大訴求、缺一不可」「光復香港，時代革命」的口號，因為當晚是831太子站慘案2個月紀念日，民眾還高喊「721不見人，831打死人」的口號。在太子站，民眾還自發舉行悼念活動。
今年香港的萬聖夜多了一股濃厚的政治氣息，不少港人戴著習近平、特首林鄭月娥等官員頭像面具，他們想用這個表達方式，告訴全世界香港正在發生的事情。
晚8點鐘左右，大批警察將蘭桂坊道路封鎖，不讓市民進入，隨後爆發警民對峙，警察狂射催淚彈、噴灑胡椒水驅散民眾，有多人被捕。今年萬聖夜香港迎來的不是徹夜狂歡，而是另一波暴力清場。
來自蘇格蘭的遊客肯.博爾斯維克（Ken Burthwick）一度上前和警察爭執，但被警方斥回。「我告訴警察他們在做錯的事情，他們在製造問題。他們真的不應該在這裡，我也告訴他們，今天是萬聖夜，是開派對的時候，我認為，警察才是問題所在。」他氣憤地說。

Photo: Halloween Carnival Sentences Hong Kong People Lan Kwai Fong ""Hello Feeding Dog Officials""

01 Nov 2019, 02:29

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 01, 2019] On October 31st, Halloween, Hong Kong citizens held a ""Hello feeding dog officer mask night"" protest. Some of the citizens wore masks of high-ranking Chinese and Hong Kong officials, or dressed up in various shapes, marched to the world-famous Lan Kwai Fong Bar Street in Central, and held a carnival reversal party to protest against the Hong Kong government’s forced ban mask. And continue to express the five major demands.
At 7 o'clock in the evening, a large number of Hong Kong people took masks from Victoria Park in Causeway Bay to Lan Kwai Fong in Central. The people kept shouting ""Seven major demands and indispensable"" slogans ""Recovering Hong Kong, the era revolution"" because the night It was the 2nd anniversary of the 831 Prince Edward Massacre. The public also shouted the slogan ""721 is missing, 831 is dead."" At the Prince’s Station, the people also spontaneously held mourning activities.
This year, Hong Kong's Halloween has a strong political atmosphere. Many Hong Kong people wear masks of officials such as Xi Jinping and Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue. They want to use this expression to tell what is going on in Hong Kong.
Around 8 o'clock in the evening, a large number of police blocked the Lan Kwai Fong road and prevented the public from entering. Then there was a confrontation between the police and the police. The police fired tear gas and sprayed pepper water to disperse the people. Many people were arrested. This year's Halloween in Hong Kong is not a night of carnival, but another wave of violence.
Ken Burthwick, a tourist from Scotland, once went to the police to argue, but was reprimanded by the police. ""I told the police that they were doing the wrong thing, they were making problems. They really shouldn't be here, and I told them that today is Halloween, when it is party, I think the police are the problem."" He said angrily.
