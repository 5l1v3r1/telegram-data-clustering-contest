Porsche has confirmed a manual version of the latest 911 will be offered in Australia from next year, but the company hasn't confirmed whether it will be offered on the base Carrera.
As before, the manual offered in non-GT 911 models will be a seven-speeder. Porsche says the 100km/h sprint takes around four seconds, and the manual is about 10kg lighter than the dual-clutch PDK automatic.
Although it locked in a 2020 launch for the three-pedal 911, Porsche Australia says it has ""nothing to confirm at this stage"" about which models will get the option.
In the USA, Porsche will only offer the option on the more expensive, more powerful 911 Carrera S and 4S.



The 'stick shift' is a no-cost option in America, and comes with the Sport Chrono pack and its active engine mounts, auto rev-matching, and a wheel-mounted drive mode switch as standard.
Were Porsche to follow in its footsteps locally, the cheapest manual 911 would start at $264,400 before on-road costs – $34,900 more expensive than the entry-level 911 Carrera.
It would also raise the price of entry to three-pedal 911 ownership by$43,900 over the now-superseded 991.2 model.
