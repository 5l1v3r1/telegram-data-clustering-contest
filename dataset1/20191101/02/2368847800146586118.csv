霧天駕駛的5種誤區

01 Nov 2019, 02:41

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月01日訊】你可能會忘記大霧天行車是非常危險的，直到它悄然而至。但是一旦大霧襲來，你就必須小心應對。畢竟，沒有公司的老闆會僅僅因為霧天就讓員工在家上班，而不用到公司裡來。那麼好吧，你可以應用你的常識和智慧來處理它，沒有什麼大不了的。
如果你來自於一個經常遇到大霧天氣的國家或地區，你就會知道在這種狀況下如何處理，你現在當然可以大吹特吹。諸如「你稱這種天氣大霧天氣？」。但是，如果你不經常，也不習慣在霧天開車，你也可能知道如何在這種天氣下開車的一些要領。但是，你的那些所謂的要領對嗎？
你可能會以常識來決定在大霧天氣如何開車。但是問題是，一些常識是基於另外一些常識或非常識的東西來決定的。因此，請對照一下下面我們提到的五種在霧中駕駛的錯誤做法，看看你的常識是不是正確？

1) 打開遠光燈

假設你在開車，突然之間遇到了一片霧。你的能見度立即降低了，你的第一個直覺應該就是打開前大燈以獲得更好的照明、更好的視野。很好，很符合常識。你當然需要打開前燈才能看清楚前面的路面。然而你發現效果並不理想，另一個常識就是，你可能需要「高燈」（或稱「遠光燈」），然後你就將高燈桿向前一推，遠光燈打開了。就像職業司機一樣，將光線直射穿過那討厭的大霧，對吧？錯誤。
事實是，遠光燈不僅不會幫助你在霧中看得更清楚，反而會降低能見度。遠光燈發出的光線會從霧中反射回來，進入你的眼睛。你看到的是前方更加濃密的霧，幾乎完全看不到路面。想一想看在逆著陽光開車時的感覺。你要想使眼睛避開陽光的照射是多麼的困難。你試圖轉動頭部，側視或移開視線，以免陽光直射你的眼睛。當你在霧天打開遠光燈時，霧的作用類似。因為遠光燈是近乎水平直射的前方，因此大霧直接將光線反射回你的眼睛。
Dateline NBC的一位記者與弗吉尼亞理工學院的知名度專家進行了一次試駕。他們發現當他打開遠光燈時，他們沒有看到車前面有任何東西。當他們將遠光燈變成近光燈時，有一個行人神奇地出現在車的前方。
簡而言之，不要將霧天打開遠光燈，而是要使用近光燈和霧燈。現在，你就應該明白，為什麼所有汽車的霧燈都是安裝在車頭下方。

2) 保持速度

在霧中緩慢行駛不只是對駕駛新手和超級謹慎的司機而言。儘管你可能會像知道你的手背一樣知道自己所駕駛的道路，但實際上在大霧中你根本看不清前方的道路。如果在這種天氣情況下你還必須開車出行，減速並謹慎駕駛是避免發生事故的最佳選擇之一。
即使你不認為自己開的很快，也還是請你時不時的看一下車速表。大霧實際上還會引起視覺錯誤，使你感覺行駛的速度比實際速度來的慢。沒有諸如建築物，樹木或其他物體作為參考，如果你不查看速度表，你很難判斷自己的行駛速度。
如果行駛中突然鑽進一團濃霧中，請不要猛踩剎車。你首先應該放開油門，減緩車速，然後僅在需要時才使用剎車。你踩剎車，跟在你後面的汽車也會踩剎車。甚至於因為後面的司機看不到前面的路況，無法判斷究竟是何種情況使得你踩剎車，而可能導致他們猛踩剎車。這就可能造成後面的一連串汽車的緊急反應，甚至造成追尾事故。

3) 打開收音機

大霧就是看得見的阻力。你看不清前面的情況，你必須緩慢行駛，這使通勤得更加無聊。那麼為什麼不打開收音機來打發時光呢？聽收音機和霧天開車似乎沒有任何關係。
但是我們的研究結果顯示，在大霧天氣開車你最好關掉收音機。同時，還請你打開車窗，這可能會使你的通勤更加安全。
在大霧中能見度很差。既然眼睛看不清，你最好把耳朵也用上，用你的聽力來判斷道路上的狀況。因此，此時打開收音機，不僅影響你的注意力和敏捷度，也影響你的聽力。搖下車窗可以讓你更清楚地聽到周圍的交通狀況，即使你不一定能看到。在你前方20英尺（6.1米）的汽車你看不到，你也許可以聽到，這對安全駕駛無疑是重要的。剎車聲、輪胎的聲音、道路上的其他噪音都可以幫助你識別周圍是否有車輛。霧天視野不好，你就要利用聽覺來幫助你駕駛。

4) 與周圍的車輛太近

在大霧中開車，如果能有其他車輛在前面，你可以將其作為參照物，從而判斷出道路的大致走向。因此，如果你在霧中駕駛並且發現一個同伴車輛，你快速的追上去，並保持一定的距離跟在它的後面。如果你很幸運，你們碰巧去的是同一個方向，你甚至可以一直尾隨其後，直到走出大霧。這聽起來似乎是一個好主意，但這是在霧中開車的另一種完全錯誤的方法。
人們在霧中趨向於彼此距離太近，因為它給了你一個視覺參考點。但是你跟隨其後的司機可能會踩剎車，追尾他前面的另一輛車或轉向錯誤的方向。如果你緊隨其後，你很快就會遇到麻煩。大家都知道開車時要保持安全車距。在霧天開車時，這一點顯得尤為重要。
保持安全距離可以大大減少發生事故的機會，因為這樣可以給你更多的應對時間。那你應該距離前面的車多遠才算安全呢？專家建議，保持至少三到四輛汽車的距離。因此，保持車距，即使你感覺自己就要被前面的司機拋棄了。

5) 像晴天一樣開車

你知道在早上通勤的道路上有一個地方，是你可以超車過去的，所以你猛踩油門並希望你能像平時一樣成功嗎？或者，你知道有一個地方，那裡有一個停牌，但從來沒有什麼行人或者汽車。你還是像平時那樣鬆開油門，略微慢下來，而不是真正停下來，仔細觀察後再走？好吧，這種駕駛方式在有霧的時候會讓你陷入困境。
為什麼開車時忽快忽慢是一個壞主意呢？首先，即便是在晴天那樣開車通常都是一個壞主意。如果在大霧天氣，能見度很差的情況下，你還這樣開車，車禍就離你不遠了。霧天時你看不到別人，別的司機也看不到你。當你油門踩下後突然發現眼前很近的距離有一輛汽車時，你就能體會到那種恐懼和後悔了。在正常天氣情況下，如果你在道路上換來換去，其他可能會向你鳴笛。但是，如果你在大霧天氣開車時突然插到另一輛車的前面，他們可能會直接用他們的車撞到你。不是他們那麼恨你，想要那樣做，只是他們沒有其他選擇。
因此，在霧天駕駛時要盡量平穩駕駛。除非絕對必要，否則不要改變車道或嘗試超過他車輛。是的，聽起來好像很像無聊，但可以挽救你和其他人的生命。

5 kinds of misunderstandings in foggy driving

01 Nov 2019, 02:41

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 01, 2019] You may forget that driving in foggy days is very dangerous until it arrives quietly. But once the fog hits, you must be careful. After all, the boss who doesn't have a company will let employees go to work at home just because they are in the fog, instead of going to the company. Well, you can apply your common sense and wisdom to deal with it, no big deal.
If you come from a country or region that often encounters heavy fog, you will know how to deal with it in this situation, and of course you can blow it now. Such as ""Do you call this weather foggy weather?"" However, if you don't often get used to driving in the fog, you may also know some tips on how to drive in this weather. But are your so-called essentials correct?
You may use common sense to decide how to drive in foggy weather. But the problem is that some common sense is based on other common sense or very knowledgeable things. Therefore, please check the following five wrong practices in the fog, to see if your common sense is correct?

1) Turn on the high beam

Suppose you are driving, and suddenly there is a fog. Your visibility is immediately reduced, and your first instinct should be to turn on the headlights for better illumination and better visibility. Very good, very common sense. Of course you need to turn on the headlights to see the road ahead. However, you find that the effect is not ideal. Another common sense is that you may need a ""highlight"" (or ""high beam""), then you will push the high pole forward and the high beam will turn on. Just like a professional driver, direct the light through the nasty fog, right? error.
The truth is that the high beam will not only help you to see more clearly in the fog, but will reduce visibility. The light from the high beam will reflect back from the fog and enter your eyes. What you see is a thicker fog in front, and you can barely see the road. Think about the feeling of driving against the sun. How difficult it is to keep your eyes away from the sun. You try to turn your head, look sideways or remove your line of sight to avoid direct sunlight in your eyes. When you turn on the high beam in the fog, the fog works like this. Because the high beam is in front of a nearly horizontal direct, the fog directly reflects the light back into your eyes.
A reporter from Dateline NBC conducted a test drive with a well-known expert at Virginia Tech. They found that when he turned on the high beam, they didn't see anything in front of the car. When they turned the high beam into a low beam, a pedestrian appeared magically in front of the car.
In short, don't turn the high beam on the fog, but use the low beam and fog lights. Now, you should understand why all the car's fog lights are mounted under the front of the car.

2) Maintain speed

Driving slowly in the fog is not just about driving a novice and super cautious driver. Although you may know the road you are driving like you know the back of your hand, you can't really see the road ahead in the fog. If you have to travel by car in this weather, slowing down and driving carefully is one of the best options to avoid accidents.
Even if you don't think you are driving very fast, please still look at the speedometer from time to time. Heavy fog can actually cause visual errors, making you feel that driving is slower than the actual speed. There are no such things as buildings, trees or other objects. If you don't look at the speedometer, it's hard to judge your speed.
If you suddenly get into a thick fog while driving, please don't slam on the brakes. You should first let go of the throttle, slow down the speed, and then use the brakes only when needed. You step on the brakes, and the car behind you will also brake. Even because the driver behind can't see the road ahead, it's impossible to tell what kind of situation is causing you to step on the brakes, which may cause them to slam on the brakes. This may cause an emergency response of a series of cars in the back, and even cause a rear-end collision.

3) Turn on the radio

Heavy fog is the visible resistance. You can't see the situation ahead, you have to drive slowly, which makes commuting more boring. So why not turn on the radio to pass the time? It doesn't seem to matter if you listen to the radio and drive in the fog.
But our research shows that you should turn off the radio when driving in foggy weather. At the same time, please open the window, which may make your commute safer.
Visibility in the fog is very poor. Since your eyes are not clear, you should use your ears and use your hearing to judge the condition on the road. Therefore, turning on the radio at this time not only affects your attention and agility, but also affects your hearing. Shaking down the window allows you to hear the traffic around you more clearly, even if you don't necessarily see it. You can't see the 20-foot (6.1-meter) car in front of you, you may hear it, which is undoubtedly important for safe driving. Braking sounds, tire sounds, and other noise on the road can help you identify vehicles around you. The foggy view is not good, you have to use your hearing to help you drive.

4) Too close to the surrounding vehicles

Driving in the fog, if there are other vehicles in front, you can use it as a reference to determine the general direction of the road. So if you drive in the fog and find a companion vehicle, you quickly catch up and keep a certain distance behind it. If you are lucky, you happen to be in the same direction, you can even follow it until you get out of the fog. This may sound like a good idea, but it's another completely wrong way to drive in the fog.
People tend to be too close to each other in the fog because it gives you a visual reference point. But the driver you follow may step on the brakes, chasing another car in front of him or turning in the wrong direction. If you follow, you will soon get into trouble. Everyone knows to keep a safe distance when driving. This is especially important when driving in fog.
Keeping a safe distance can greatly reduce the chance of an accident, because it can give you more time to deal with it. So how far should you be safe from the front car? Experts recommend keeping the distance of at least three to four cars. Therefore, keep the distance, even if you feel that you are going to be abandoned by the driver in front.

5) Drive like a sunny day

You know there is a place on the road for commuting in the morning, you can overtake the car, so you slam on the gas pedal and hope that you can be as successful as usual? Or, you know there is a place where there is a suspension, but there are never pedestrians or cars. Are you still releasing the throttle as usual, slowing down slightly, instead of actually stopping, carefully observing and then going? Well, this driving style will get you into trouble when it is foggy.
Why is it a bad idea to drive suddenly and slowly? First of all, even driving on a sunny day is usually a bad idea. If you are driving in such a foggy weather and poor visibility, the car accident is not far from you. You can't see others in the fog, and other drivers can't see you. When you get out of the throttle and suddenly find a car at a very close distance, you can feel the fear and regret. In normal weather conditions, if you trade on the road, others may whistle to you. However, if you suddenly drive into the front of another car while driving in heavy fog, they may hit you directly with their car. It’s not that they hate you so much, they want to do that, but they have no other choice.
Therefore, drive as smoothly as possible while driving in the fog. Do not change lanes or try to exceed his vehicle unless absolutely necessary. Yes, it sounds like boring, but it can save you and others.
