“Tushimda marhum erim tinmay olovda yonardi”. Gulchi ayol hikoyasi

01 Nov 2019, 20:39


“Daryo” ijtimoiy hayotda o‘z o‘rniga ega, biroq jamoatchilik e’tiboridan ko‘pincha chetda qoladigan kasb egalari bilan suhbat qilmoqda. “Soyadagi odamlar” loyihasining bu galgi qahramoni uch yildan buyon obodonlashtirish boshqarmasida gulchi bo‘lib ishlayotgan ayol.


Suhbatdoshimizning iltimosiga ko‘ra, ism-sharifi hamda shaxsini oshkor etishi mumkin bo‘lgan boshqa ma’lumotlar o‘zgartirildi.

Ismim Gulzoda. Yoshim 42 da. Ikki o‘g‘il, bir qizim bor. 2016-yildan beri shahar obodonlashtirish bo‘limida gulchi bo‘lib ishlayman.

Maktabni bitiriboq oila qurganman. O‘qib, biror kasb egallashga sharoitim bo‘lmagan. Rahmatli turmush o‘rtog‘im  shahar obodonlashtirish bo‘limida suvchi bo‘lib ishlardi. Men esa bolalarimni tarbiya qilib uyda o‘tirardim.
Xo‘jayinim qo‘li gul usta bo‘lgan. Ancha yillar oldin hovlida kattagina qurilish boshlab qo‘ygan, lekin ko‘pdan beri qolib ketayotgandi. Ularni tezroq bitirish kerak edi. Shuning uchun siz uylarni oxiriga yetkazing, o‘rningizga men ishlayman deb o‘rin almashganmiz. Axir kimdir ishlab uyga pul olib kelishi kerak edi. Xullas, shunday qilib erimning o‘rniga men gulchi bo‘lib ishga joylashganman.

Gullar insonga boshqacha zavq beradi

Hamkasblarim bilan shahrimizning markaziy ko‘chalariga gul ekamiz. Bu insondan katta mahorat talab qiladi. Sababi, chizig‘ini chizig‘iga qilib  shunday gul ekishingiz kerakki, siz chiqargan fantaziya uzoqdan qaraganda boshqalarga ko‘rinishi kerak. Ekkanda ham gullarning shakli ko‘rinishi, hammasi bir-biriga hamohang bo‘lishi kerak.

Kuch-g‘ayratim bo‘lsa, yana ishlardim

Ish vaqtim soat 8:00 dan 16:00 gacha. Oyligim 700 ming so‘mdan oshadi. Ishdan kelib bolalarimga ovqat qilaman, uyni yig‘ishtiraman. Shu bilan kun kechkiradi. Yosh o‘tgan sari ayol kishining ko‘p narsaga qurbi yetmay qolarkan. Kuch-g‘ayratim bo‘lsa qani, har qancha ishlashga rozi edim. Biroq hozircha ishim shu. Ba’zida uyda “zakaz”ga kelinlarning ko‘rpa-to‘shagini qoviyman.

700 ming so‘m bir oyga yetadimi?

Yetsa ham, yetmasa ham nima qilaman, mayli Alloh barakasini bersin. Qo‘shimchasiga voyaga yetmagan qizimga 250 ming so‘m davlatdan yordam puli olaman. Yaqinda kreditga “tefal”, dazmol, televizor oldim. Kredit to‘lab, ro‘zg‘orimni tebratib yuribman.

Bu hayotda oson ishning o‘zi yo‘q 

Yil o‘n ikki oy tashqarida ishlash ayol kishiga biroz og‘irlik qilarkan. Ayniqsa yoz oylari saratonda ishlash juda qiyin bo‘ladi. Agar qishda ham tadbir yoki kattaroq mehmon keladigan bo‘lsa, qahraton bo‘lishiga qaramay joy tayyorlab, “Kamaz-Kamaz” gullarni ekishga majbur bo‘lamiz.
Havo issiqmi, sovuqmi farqi yo‘q. Davlat oylik to‘layaptimi, biz ham vijdonan ishlashimiz kerak. Ehtiyot choramizni ko‘rib: issiq kiyinib, yaxshilab ovqatlanib, ishlarimizni qilaveramiz. Hammamiz ham bola-chaqa, ro‘zg‘or tashvishida yuribmiz. Barchamizga Xudoning o‘zi sabr-toqat bersin.

Sharoitim yaxshi bo‘lganda bir kun ham ishlamasdim

O‘tgan yili erim bir odamning uyida ishlayotib, bexosdan o‘tib qoldi. Peshinda bolam “dadam o‘lib qoldi” deb yig‘lab  keldi. Tushimmi, o‘ngimmi tushunmay qoldim. Kutilmaganda musibat boshiga tushsa, inson dovdirab qolarkan. Ancha o‘zimizga kelolmay yurdik. Lekin Allohning irodasi, nima ham qilardik. Hammasiga ko‘nib yashayapmiz.
Sharoitim yaxshi bo‘lganda bir kun ham ishlamasdim. Lekin boquvchim yo‘q, uch nafar bolam, ustiga-ustak kreditim ham bor. Shuning uchun ham ishlashga majburman. Ba’zida ro‘zg‘or, oila tashvishi deb ayolligim esimdan chiqib qoladi.

Xudoga shukur, hozir ikkala o‘g‘lim ham yonimga kirib qolgan. Katta o‘g‘lim Ubaydullo 21 yoshda. Firmada taksichi bo‘lib ishlayapti. Ikkinchim Mirmuhsin ham akasining oldida. U ham shofyorlik qilib pul topyapti. Qizim esa hali kichkina. Maktabda o‘qiydi.

Dunyoda har qanday qiyinchilikka chidash mumkin, lekin nohaqlikka emas 

Bir kuni rahbarimizga aybini yuziga aytganim uchun meni jazolab, boshqa brigadaga o‘tkazvorishini, bunga majbur bo‘lishimni aytdi. Lekin men o‘tolmasdim. Sababi, u aytgan joyga ikkita avtobusga chiqib, bir kunda to‘rt ming yo‘lkira qilib borib kelish kerak. Bu tushlikdan tashqari “rasxod”. O‘zi oyligimiz qancha? 700 ming oylik ichida 440 ming kredit to‘layman. Qolgan 300 mingi bolalarimning yeb-ichishiga, bundan tashqari gaz, svet, kommunal to‘lovlarga ketadi. Ularga yetkazishning iloji yo‘q. Qancha aytsam ham tushunmadi.
Oddiy gulchi bo‘lsam ham qonun-qoidani juda yaxshi bilaman. U ming boshliq bo‘lgani bilan men xohlagan taqdirdagina bu ishni qilishi mumkin, majburlab o‘tkazib yuborishga haqi yo‘q. Qancha aytmay bo‘lmadi, baribir o‘tasan deb men bilan olishaverdi. Keyin kerakli joyga ariza bilan chiqdim. Ertasigayoq eng katta rahbarimiz hammamizni yig‘ib, bu qilgan ishi uchun uning 30 foiz oyligidan kesib, tushuntirish xati yozdirib oldi.
Keyinroq opa uzr, mendan o‘tdi deb kechirim ham so‘radi, lekin baribir og‘riqlar, haqoratlar ko‘nglimdan ketgani yo‘q.
Ochig‘ini aytsam, muammoyimni hal qilib bergan o‘sha rahbardan ham minnatdormasman. Chunki u men murojaat qilganim uchun emas, balki “tepa”dan shuni tinchit degan buyruq bo‘lgani uchun kelib muammoyimni hal qildi. Bo‘lmasa murojaatim arizam o‘rgangunicha qancha kutardim, bilmayman.

Hayotingizda shunday vaziyatlar bo‘ladiki, tuqqan onangizga ham aytolmaysiz.

Boshimdan o‘tgan bir voqeani aytib bermoqchiman, balki bu kimgadir ibrat bo‘lar.
Erim juda ko‘p ichardi. Ichib olgandan keyin bizga, bolalarimga kun bermasdi. Inson tushkunlikka tushib qolsa, najot yo‘lini qidiradi. Ayniqsa ayol kishi. Bir kuni tanishlarimdan Andijonda dam soladigan qori domla haqida eshitib qoldim. Bir borib duo qildiraychi, zora erim insofga qaytar deb oldiga bordim. 3—4 marta qatnab, foydasini sezdim.
Bu orada erim Rossiyaga ketib, olti oyda qaytib keldi. Unda ikkita o‘g‘lim bor edi. Bir kuni xo‘jayinim hamma sheriklarimning qizi bor, faqat menda yo‘q ekan,  ko‘nglim bir g‘alati bo‘ldi, deb gapirib qoldi. Siz qizi bor dada bo‘lolasizmi, deb so‘radim. Erim hayron bo‘lib, bu nima deganingiz deb so‘raganida, qizi bor dadalar ichmaydi, chekmaydi, ibodat qiladi, haloldan rizqlanadi, bo‘lmasa kasri qizlarga uradi, deb javob berdim. Shunda erim agar qizim bo‘lganida ichmasdim, chekmasdim deb menga va’da berdi. Men uning gaplariga ishondim.
Andijonga ziyoratga borganimda, ustoz, dadamiz shunday deyapti, deb aytganimda, qori domla bir qiz tilab beray, zora ering iymonga qaytsa, deb duo qildi. Duolarimizni Xudo qabul qilib, olti oydan keyin bo‘yimda bo‘ldi. Lekin erim tuqqunimcha ishonmadi. Iching to‘la o‘g‘il, hech qachon qiz tug‘maysan derdi.
Vaqti soati yetib, qizim tug‘ildi. Biroq turmush o‘rtog‘im bir kun ham va’dasida turmadi. Men esa unga juda ishongandim. Ichmasligini xohlardim. Mast bo‘lsa tamom, bizga kun yo‘q edi. Juda qiynalardik.
Qizim tug‘ilsa-da, bu azoblar kamaymadi. Qish qahratonida ko‘chalarda qolib ketdim. Ustozning oldiga endi nima qilay deb yig‘lab borsam, agar ering o‘zini o‘nglab olmasa, boshiga balo keladi dedilar. Buni erim kasal bo‘lib biror joyda qolib ketadi, men esa unga qarayman, keyin ichmaydi deb tushundim.
Oradan yillar o‘tdi. Bir kuni erim ishga ketdi; “obed”da o‘g‘lim dadam o‘lib qoldi deb kirib keldi. Juma kuni peshinga azon chaqirilayotganda joni chiqibdi.
Bilasizmi, o‘shanda xo‘jayinim 18 kun tinmay ichib, 19-kuniga o‘lib qolgandi.

Erim o‘lishini istamagandim...

Bir hafta oldin juma kuni namozda duo qilayotib, “Ey Robbim, erimga insof bergin, icholmaydigan qilib qo‘ygin. Baribir shu er menga kerak. Bolalarimning otasi, men zaifaman. Shuncha qurilishlar faqat uning qo‘lidan keladi.  Hamma ichuvchilar o‘lgan bo‘lsa, xunuk holatlarda avariya bo‘lib, xor bo‘lib o‘lgan. Xudoyim, erim qachon o‘lsa ham o‘zing chiroyli o‘limingdan nasib qilgin. Men erimdan ming marta roziman. Shunga senam rozi bo‘lasan”, deb duo qilgandim. Lekin aynan keyingi jumaga o‘lib qolishini bilmaganman. Hatto o‘lib qolganini sheriklari ham bilmabdi. O‘sha kuni asrga qolmay chiqarib yubordik.

Tushimda erim tinmay olovda yonardi...

Ko‘milgandan tortib to bir yilgacha erimning yonganini ko‘raverdim. Keyin yana ustozga yig‘lab bordim. Ustoz, nuqul erimning yonganini ko‘ryapman, desam, tandirdami, deb so‘radilar.
“Yo‘q, undan o‘n barobar katta narsada yonyapti. Tinmay menga tikilib qarayapti. Butun hayotimni azobda o‘tkazgan, biror marta shirin gapini eshitmagan erimga rahmim keldi”, dedim.
Ustoz “demak, eringning xatolari ko‘p ekan, o‘zing bilasan, ularni tuzat”, deb maslahat berdilar.
Erim bir marta tul xotinnikidan “truba” o‘g‘irlab olib chiqqan edi. Axir arzimagan narsa, ozgina pulga ham berardi-ku, desam, bir urgan, tomorqaga uchib ketganman.
“O‘sha ‘truba’ni olib kirib bersang bo‘lmaydimi, deb so‘radi ustoz.
“Olib kirolmayman, u ‘truba’ni erim kirishimizga ‘svarka’lab qo‘ygan. Kelgandan beri foydalanamiz, deb javob berdim.
“Bo‘lmasa hisob-kitob qilib, o‘shaning miqdoricha pul to‘lab qo‘ygin”, dedilar.
Keyin temir bozoridan ‘truba’ning metrini surishtirib, besh metriga 25 ming pul olib kirib, onangizdan qarzim bor edi, deb o‘g‘liga tashlab chiqdim.
Ikkinchisi qo‘shnimizni telefoni ko‘chada tushib qolganida, erim uni topib olib, qaytarib beraylik desam unamasdan, sotib ro‘zg‘orga ishlatib yuborgan edi.
“Ustoz, uning pulini qanday to‘layman, axir u ishga o‘n yildan oshdi-ku”, desam, “hojat namozini o‘qi, shunga qarab ish qilamiz”, dedilar.
Namozni o‘qib, Allohim, 80 ming bersam rozi bo‘lasanmi, deb so‘rab yotsam, tushimda to‘rtta paxtasi yo‘q to‘shak oldim. Ustozning ta’biricha, to‘rt soni bu men bilan bolalarim, paxtasi yo‘q to‘shak esa chala degani ekan. Qanchaligini yana so‘rab yotgin degandilar. Xudoyim, 100 ming bersam rozi bo‘lasanmi, deb niyat qilib yotsam, tushimda tandirga ikki qavatdan patir yopayapman ekan. Hayotda patir ikki qavat bo‘lmaydi. Buning ma’nosi qilayotgan ishimiz to‘g‘riligi ekan. Demak, 100 mingga to‘xtabmiz ekan, deb plastikdan yechtirdim. Keyin qori domla aytganidek, qo‘shnimga bolalarimni duo qilib qo‘ying, deb, ichimda erimning qarzi qiyomatga qolmadi, deb berib chiqdim.
Oradan uch kun o‘tib qo‘shnim tush ko‘ribdi. Aytishicha, men Baytulloh tepasida ibodat qilyapman ekan. Erim esa pastda turib meni uch qo‘shnimga ko‘rsatib, “shunday ahli ayolim borligi uchun Alloh boshimga salla kiygizdi. Bu yil men hoji dada bo‘ldim”, debdilar.
Erim biror marta ikki rakat namozini vaqtida do‘ndirib o‘qimagan, shuncha gunohlari bo‘lsa-da, Alloh erimning boshiga salla kiygizib qo‘yibdi. Tush ta’biridan sallani ko‘rsam, bu ulug‘lik ekan.
Erimdan biror marta shirin gap eshitmasam-da, tushimga kirib, yalinib qaragani, uning bitta nigohi uchun shu ishlarni qildim.
Yaxshiga yaxshilik qilish hammaning qo‘lidan keladi. Lekin yomonga yaxshilik qilish faqat mo‘minning qo‘lidan keladi. Alloh hammamizni mo‘min qilsin.

Har kuningga shukur qil

Erimdan har safar nolib borsam, ustoz farzandi og‘ir onalarni ko‘rsatib, “ering ichib kun bermayotgan bo‘lsa, anavi ayolning bolasi juda yomon og‘riyapti. Seni-chi, farzandlaring sog‘-ku, shuning shukrini qilgin”, deb nasihat qilardilar.
Kimdir badavlat yashab, dabdabali to‘ylar qiladi. Kimdir bir burda non topolmaydi. Inson o‘zida bor narsalar uchun hatto ichayotgan suvi, havosining shukrini qilishi lozim. Qancha shukur qilsak, hayotimiz shuncha iziga tushib ketadi.

Oddiy o‘zbek ayoli nimani ham orzu qilardi...

Albatta, farzandlari kamolini ko‘rishni, ularni uyli-joyli qilishni-da.
Yuqorida aytganimdek, erim ustaligi uchun hovlida uyning betonini quyib, devorlarini ko‘tarib qo‘ygan. Faqat tomi yo‘q. Katta o‘g‘lim 22 ga qarab ketyapti. Alloh nasib qilsa, tezroq tomlarni yopib, kelin tomonning bitta xonasini bitkizib, o‘g‘limni uylab qo‘ysam bo‘ldi. Mendan baxtli odam bo‘lmasdi. Lekin bularning bari mablag‘ga borib taqaladi. Xudoyim farzandlarimning dastiga bersin, halol ishlab, topib uylarini bitkizishsin.
Xonzodabegim A’zamova suhbatlashdi.

""In the dream, my deceased husband was constantly burning."" The Woman's Story

01 Nov 2019, 20:39


“River” is talking to professionals who have a role in public life but are often left out of the public eye. This year's Hero of the Shadow People project is a woman who has been working as a florist for three years in the zoning department.


At the request of the interlocutor, the name and other information that may be disclosed are changed.

My name is Gulzoda. I am 42 years old. I have two sons and a daughter. Since 2016 I have been working as a florist in the city beautification department.

I graduated from high school and married. I did not have the opportunity to study and acquire a profession. My dear wife worked as a plumber in the town's zoning department. And I was home with my kids.
My master was a master of flower. Many years ago, a large building was started in the yard, but it was long overdue. They had to be completed sooner. So you finished the house, and we replaced you with a job. After all, someone had to work and bring home money. So instead of my husband, I got a job as a florist.

Flowers give a person a different taste

Together with my colleagues, we plant flowers on the central streets of our city. It requires great skill. The reason is that you have to plant flowers on the line so that the fantasy you create should be visible to others from afar. Even when planting, the flowers should be shaped and harmonized.

If I had the energy I would do it again

My working hours are from 8am to 4pm. My salary is over 700,000. When I come home from work I cook for my children and clean the house. This is how it works. As women grow older, many women cannot afford it. If I had the energy, I would agree to work hard. But for now, that's what I do. Sometimes I donate beds for brides at home.

Is 700,000 sums a month?

May God bless you, whether you do or not. In addition, I receive 250,000 sums from the state for my underage daughter. Recently, I got a ""tefal"", a shower, a television. I am paying for the loan and shaking my head.

There is nothing easy in this life

Working out twelve months a year is a bit daunting for a woman. During the summer months, it can be very difficult to work with cancer. If an event or larger visitor arrives in the winter, we will have to prepare a place and plant the Kamaz-Kamaz flowers, despite the severe weather.
It doesn't matter whether it's hot or cold. We also have to work honestly, whether the government pays a salary. Take precautions: Dress warmly, eat well, and continue to work. We all have children and household problems. May God bless us all.

If my condition was good I would not work one day

Last year, my husband was working at a man's house and passed away accidentally. At noon, my child cried, ""Dad is dead."" I don't understand whether I understand or not. When an unexpected calamity strikes, the person is confused. We walked for a while. But it is God's will that we do. We all live in harmony.
If my condition was good I would not work one day. But I have no bread, I have three children, and I have a loan. So I have to work. I sometimes forget that I am a housewife, a family concern.

Thank God, both of my sons are with me now. My eldest son Ubaydullo is 21 years old. He works as a taxi driver in the company. The other is Mirmuhsin, his brother. He also makes money as a driver. My daughter is still young. He goes to school.

It is possible to endure all kinds of difficulties in the world, but not in injustice

One day I told our leader that he would punish me for my guilt and move me to another brigade, forcing me to do so. But I couldn't pass. He said that he had to take two buses to the place he was talking about and get four thousand rides a day. It's a ""breakdown"" except lunch. How much is our salary? I will pay 440,000 in 700,000 months. The other 300,000 of my children go to eat and drink, plus gas, electricity, utility bills. It is impossible to deliver them. He didn't understand how much I said.
Even though I am a simple florist, I know the rules. He is the commander of the thousand, but he can do it if I want to, and he has no right to forcibly go. It was hard to tell, but he still kept fighting with me. Then I applied for the right place. The next morning, our biggest leader gathered us all and cut a 30% payout for his work and wrote an explanation letter.
The sister later apologized that she had passed away, but the pain and insults did not disappoint me.
Frankly, I do not thank the leader who solved my problem. Because he came and solved my problem, not because I was addressing, but because he had a command from the top to calm it down. Otherwise, I do not know how long I waited until my application was processed.

There are many situations in your life that you cannot even tell your mother.

I want to tell a story from my experience, but maybe it's a good example.
My husband drank a lot. After drinking, she didn't give us any food. When a person is depressed, he looks for a way to salvation. Especially women. One day I heard from a acquaintance about a curious teacher in Andijan. Let me go and pray that my husband will return to justice. I went 3-4 times and realized the benefits.
In the meantime, my husband went to Russia and came back in six months. He had two sons. One day my boss told me that all my coworkers had a daughter, but that I didn't have one, and that was a bit strange. I asked if you could have a daughter. When my husband was surprised and asked what he meant, I told him that my father's daughters would not drink, smoke, pray, be honest, otherwise they would hit the girls. My husband promised me that if I had a daughter, I wouldn't drink or smoke. I believed her.
When I went to Andijan and told her that my teacher was saying this, my curious teacher would ask a girl and pray that her husband would return to faith. God accepted our prayers and stayed six months. But my husband didn't believe it until I was born. Your son is full and says he will never have a baby.
The time came and my daughter was born. However, my wife did not stay one day. And I believed in him. I would rather not drink. When we got drunk, we didn't have a day. It was very difficult.
Although my daughter was born, the pain did not diminish. I stayed in the streets during the winter. When I went to the teacher, I was crying about what to do, and I was told that if my husband didn't recover, he would be in trouble. I realized that my husband would get sick and stay somewhere and I would look at him and not drink.
Years have passed. One day my husband went to work; In ""Obed"", my son came to my father's death. Friday morning when noon was called.
You know, at that time my husband was drinking for 18 days and died on the 19th.

I didn't want my husband to die ...

When he was praying Friday a week ago, he said, ""My Lord, give my husband a fair place and leave him not to drink. I want this place anyway. Father of my children, I am weak. So much of the construction is just in his hands. All drinkers were killed, but in the worst cases there was an accident and a humiliation. God bless my beautiful death even when my husband dies. I agree with my husband a thousand times. I will accept this. "" But I didn't know if he would die on that Friday. Even his friends did not know that he was dead. That day we were expelled.

In the dream my husband was constantly burning ...

I watched my husband burn for a year, until he was buried. Then I went to the teacher again. The teacher asked if I could see my husband burned.
""No, it burns ten times as much."" She is staring at me. I felt sorry for my husband who had been in pain all my life and had never heard anything sweet.
The teacher advised, ""You know, your husband has a lot of mistakes and you can fix them.""
My husband once stole a groove from a widow. After all, if I gave a small amount of money, I hit the ground.
""Can you bring that pipe?"" The teacher asked.
""I can't get in. He pushed the pipe into my husband's entrance."" I replied that we will use it since we arrived.
They said, ""If it is not, then pay the same amount.""
Then I took a pipe meter from the iron market, took 25,000 dollars for five meters, and threw it at my son saying he was in debt to your mother.
When the second phone rang down the street, my husband found it and sold it to me, not wanting to give it back.
I said, ""Master, how do I pay for it? It's been more than ten years.""
After praying and asking Allah if I would give 80,000, I got a bed that had no cotton. The teacher says that the number four means that I am with my children and that the bed with no cotton is half-finished. They asked me to go to bed. Oh my God, if I was going to give 100,000, I was closing in on the oven on two floors. In life there are no two layers. This means that what we do is right. So, I stripped off the plastic saying we were stuck for 100,000. Then as the curious teacher said. I told my neighbor that he would bless my children and that my husband's debt was not over.
Three days later, I had a dream. He said that I was praying on top of the Sacred House. My husband came downstairs and showed me to my three neighbors, saying, ""God has put a turban on my head for such a woman. I was a pilgrim this year. '
My husband never performed two rak'ats in a timely manner, but God put a turban on my husband's head despite all his sins. When I see a turban in a dream interpretation, it's great.
Although I never heard a sweet word from my husband, I dreamed and begged him to do so for one of his eyes.
Everyone can do good. But the good of the evil is only in the believer. May Allah make us all believers.

Give thanks every day

Every time I win over my husband, the teacher points to the heavy mothers and says, ""If your husband is not eating enough, this woman's baby is very ill. Thank you, your children are healthy, so give thanks. '
Some people live well and have luxurious weddings. No one can find bread here. A person should even be thankful for the water and air they drink for what they have. The more we give thanks, the more our lives become trapped.

What did an ordinary Uzbek woman dream about ...

Of course, they want to see their children grow up and make them their home.
As I said before, my husband poured concrete on the house and raised the walls for his mastery. No roof. My eldest son is turning 22. I wish I could close the roofs, close the bridal room, and marry my son. I couldn't be happier than me. But it's all about money. May my God give them to my children, to work honestly, and to find and lay down their houses.
