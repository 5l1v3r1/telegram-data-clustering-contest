Gunmen kill 53 Malian soldiers and a civilian in an attack on a military base in the northeastern Indelimane region on Friday, November 1. after a similar incident causing the death of 40 soldiers.

Friday's attack wounded dozens of Malian troops and the insurgents successfully destroyed several weapons in an army barracks in Indelimane, as it was announced that the government had sent more troops. they will take the transport to the area.
The source said that the insurgents kidnapped the Malian army, and that in 2012, from March to April, al-Qaida seized control of northern areas following the withdrawal of its forces from the north.
Early in 2013 under French-Sahel regional cooperation, a joint force was formed to fight the jihadist group, despite efforts by the insurgents to remain in Mali.
