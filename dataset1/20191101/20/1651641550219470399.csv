Motorola’s foldable Razr specs leaked, and it’s not pretty
01 Nov 2019, 20:33 by Surur
Thanks to Evan Blass AKA evLeaks we have already had a very good look at Motorola’s new folding phone, the new Razr.
We don’t quite know what the device is running under the hood, however, but the Editor in Chief of XDA-Developers has now also spilt those beans.



The specs include:

sdm710, likely Qualcomm Snapdragon 710
 Main display: 6.20″ 2142×876 by BOE
Closed display: 2.69″ 800×600 also by BOE
4/6GB RAM
 64/128GB storage
 Now believed to have 2510mAh battery
 SKUs: Verizon (US) and ROW

The weakest point is obviously the Snapdragon 710 processor and small 2510 battery. It is likely the first spec in particular which would turn buyers off, especially as the handset is expected to cost around $1500.





Motorola has a press event on November 13 in Los Angeles where we expect the device to be launched. Are any of our readers planning to pony up the asking price? Let us know below.
