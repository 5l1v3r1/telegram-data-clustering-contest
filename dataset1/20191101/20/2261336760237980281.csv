While all eyes are focused on the mammoth card that is UFC 244, in just over a month’s time the UFC closes out its 2019 pay-per-view schedule with a tripleheader of title fights.

On December 14th at UFC 245, Kamaru Usman defends his welterweight title against Colby Covington, who thinks he’s the champion and says he’s the champion... but he’s not the champion. You know it’ll be one hell of a time at the mic for Colby today. Meanwhile, the co-main event is men’s featherweight king Max Holloway against Alex Volkanovski, while two-division champ Amanda Nunes puts her women’s bantamweight title on the line versus Germaine de Randamie.
All of the title fight participants will take part at Friday’s press conference in New York, along with UFC president Dana White. You can watch the UFC 245 presser in the video at the top of the page, starting at 5 PM ET/2 PM PT.
