Skipper Scott Brown is struggling to be fit for Celtic's Betfred Cup semi-final against Hibernian at Hampden Park on Saturday.
The midfielder went off with a thigh injury in the 2-0 home win over St Mirren on Wednesday night and is a doubt.
He declared himself fit afterwards but Celtic boss Neil Lennon revealed earlier on Friday the veteran could now miss the showdown against his former club.
Striker Vakoun Bayo will see a specialist on Monday with regards a knee problem, Leigh Griffiths and Mikey Johnston are back in training while Jozo Simunovic (knee) remains out alongside Daniel Arzani (knee) and Greg Taylor is cup-tied.
Hibs, meanwhile, will assess winger Martin Boyle after he made his comeback off the bench from an ankle break in midweek.
Boss Paul Heckingbottom also reported multiple knocks on unnamed players.
Potential line-up



Provisional squad
Forster
Frimpong
Bauer
Elhamed
Ajer
Bolingoli
Jullien
Rogic
Bitton
Brown
McGregor
Ntcham
Forrest
Edouard
Christie
Hayes
Morgan

Griffiths
