近大サークル一気飲み死亡で９人略式起訴…過失致死罪

01 Nov 2019, 20:00

　２０１７年に近畿大のテニスサークルの飲み会で一気飲みをした男子学生が死亡した事故で、大阪地検は、保護責任者遺棄致死容疑で書類送検された学生ら１２人（２２～２３歳）のうち９人について、より法定刑の軽い過失致死罪で略式起訴する方針を固めた。学生の飲酒死亡事故を巡る起訴は異例。他の３人は関与が薄いとして不起訴とする。
　２年だった登森勇斗（ともりはやと）さん（当時２０歳）は１７年１２月、サークルの飲み会で、ショットグラス約２０杯分のウォッカをジョッキで一気飲みし、昏睡（こんすい）状態になって別の学生宅に運ばれ、翌日、嘔吐（おうと）物をのどに詰まらせて死亡したとされる。大阪府警は今年５月、３年生４人と介抱役として呼ばれた２年生８人の計１２人を書類送検。一部は起訴を求める「厳重処分」の意見を付けた。

9 people have been indicted for the death of a junior college circle.

01 Nov 2019, 20:00

In the accident that a male student who had swallowed at a drinking party at a tennis club in Kinki University died in 2017, the Osaka District Prosecutor has 12 students (22-23 years old) who have been sent documents on the suspicion of the abandonment of surrender to the protection officer. Nine of them have been firmly indicted for prosecution for negligence and fatal charges of lighter punishment. The prosecution over a student's fatal accident was unusual. The other three are not charged because they are less involved.
Hayato Tomori (20 years old at that time), who was two years old, drank about 20 glasses of vodka with a mug at a drinking party in a circle in December 2005, and was in a coma. He was taken to another student's house and died the next day due to clogging with a vomit. In May this year, the Osaka Prefectural Police sent 12 documents, including 4 third graders and 8 second graders who were called as intermediaries. Some gave the opinion of “severe disposition” calling for prosecution.
