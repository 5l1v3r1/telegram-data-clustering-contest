幾無驚奇照劇本演 四中全會覆誦堅持與完善
01 Nov 2019, 20:22 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, 中央通訊社
（中央社記者邱國強北京特稿）中共19屆四中全會昨天平靜地落幕，除了對香港問題的主張令人心頭一驚，既沒有外傳的人事變動，也沒有什麼經濟政策方案，有的只是早已訂好、一切照劇本演的「堅持與完善」基調。
這場全會照什麼劇本走？自然是對「黨政軍民學，東西南北中，黨是領導一切的」的堅持。至於「完善」，再多的詞藻堆砌，目的都只是為了對黨領導一切的「堅持」。
在四中全會召開前，中共10月24日先召開了政治局會議，審議通過「中共中央關於堅持和完善中國特色社會主義制度、推進國家治理體系和治理能力現代化若干重大問題的決定」。從昨天發表的會議公報證明，全會就是圍繞著這項決定作背書。
也因為這樣，「堅持與完善」這5個字，成為貫穿整場四中全會的主軸，完全沒有脫離政治局會議為全會設定的主軸。而如今的中共政治局，若沒有總書記習近平點頭，怎敢冒大不韙自行設定全會的主軸？
首先在人事上，除了追認前中國證監會主席、前中共中央委員劉士余留黨察看2年案，為政治局這項決定背書，以及依黨章遞補馬正武、馬偉明等2人為中央委員外，並沒有任何人事變動。
由於先前一度傳出，四中全會將決定「政治局常委將增加2人、由7人增為9人」，連人選都已出現的消息；昨晚會議公報公布後，中國媒體圈便出現「補兩個沒錯，只不過是中委不是常委」的笑話。
雖然照劇本演出，但並不代表中共沒有注意到從19屆三中以來的1年8個多月，中國內外已經發生了諸多的變化。其中，美中貿易戰及其對中國經濟衰退的加乘效應，以及香港「反送中」運動延燒未息，在政治局會議及四中全會上，仍然受到了注意。
全會公報提到，面對中國「內外風險挑戰明顯增多的複雜局面」，中共政治局「準確把握國內國際兩個大局，著力抓好『發展和安全』兩件大事」。與以往中共話語中較常強調的「發展與穩定」相較，「安全」取代了穩定。這代表來自外部的變數，已被中共認定為風險。
因此，四中全會公報裡，出現了「必須嚴格依照憲法和基本法，對香港、澳門特別行政區實行『管治』，維護香港、澳門長期繁榮穩定。建立健全特別行政區『維護國家安全』的法律制度和執行機制」，被普遍認為是北京將對香港採取緊縮手段的訊號。
在四中全會設定的13個需要「堅持與完善」的領域中，列入了「一國兩制」，目標既有港澳，也有台灣。如今，全會對執行香港「一國兩制」政策，所選擇的「完善」方式卻是動手緊縮，雖完全符合中共的思維模式，但日後可能引發的效應，卻值得觀察。
然而，面對經濟衰退這一中國國內潛藏的風險，四中全會則沒有直接回應，只是將「社會主義基本經濟制度」，列入需要「堅持與完善」的13個領域之一，並重申習近平提出的「兩個毫不動搖」：毫不動搖鞏固和發展公有制經濟，毫不動搖鼓勵、支持、引導非公有制經濟發展。
相較於以往中央全會經常出現驚心動魄的權力鬥爭及政策轉折，中共1990年代末期以來的中央全會，明顯較少出現設定議題以外的動議。也就是說，20多年來的中央全會，越來越照著劇本演出。
特別是如今在黨內大權定於一尊、權力直逼毛澤東的習近平治下，中央全會要想不照劇本演出，更是難上加難。（編輯：林克倫）1081101

A few surprises, the drama, the performance of the Fourth Plenary Session
01 Nov 2019, 20:22 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Qiu Guoqiang Beijing special draft) The Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee calmly ended yesterday. Apart from the proposition of the Hong Kong issue, it is shocking. There are no personnel changes and no economic policy plans. Some have only already booked. Well, everything is based on the ""persistence and perfection"" tone of the performance.
What script does this plenary follow? Nature is the insistence on ""the party, the government, the military and the people, the east, the west, the north, the middle, the party is leading everything."" As for ""perfect"", more words are piled up, and the purpose is only to ""persist"" all the party leadership.
Before the Fourth Plenary Session, the CCP first convened a meeting of the Politburo on October 24 to deliberate and pass the ""Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Several Major Issues Concerning Adhering to and Improving the Socialist System with Chinese Characteristics and Advancing the Modernization of the National Governance System and Governance Capability."" From the communique issued yesterday, it was proved that the plenary was endorsed around this decision.
Because of this, the five words of ""persistence and perfection"" have become the main axis of the entire Plenary Session of the Plenary Session of the Plenary Session of the Plenary Session of the Plenary Session. Now, if the CCP’s Politburo does not have General Secretary Xi Jinping nod, how dare to take the initiative to set the main axis of the plenary?
First of all, in personnel matters, in addition to ratifying the former Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the former CPC Central Committee member Liu Shiyu, staying in the party to see the two-year case, endorsing the decision of the Politburo, and handing over Ma Zhengwu and Ma Weiming as members of the Central Committee in accordance with the Party Constitution, there is no Any personnel changes.
As a result of the previous outbreak, the Fourth Plenary Session decided that ""the Politburo Standing Committee will increase two people, from seven to nine"", and even the news of the candidates has appeared; after the announcement of the meeting last night, the Chinese media circle appeared. It’s true that two of them are correct, but it’s just a joke that the Central Committee is not a regular member.
Although the performance of the script, it does not mean that the CCP has not noticed that it has been more than eight months since the 19th Third Session, and many changes have taken place at home and abroad. Among them, the US-China trade war and its multiplier effect on China's economic recession, as well as the unsuccessful movement of Hong Kong's ""reverse delivery"" movement, still received attention at the Politburo meeting and the Fourth Plenary Session.
The Plenary Newsletter mentioned that in the face of China's ""complex situation of increasing internal and external risk challenges,"" the Politburo of the CPC ""accurately grasps the two major domestic and international situations and strives to grasp the two major events of ""development and security."" Compared with the ""development and stability"" that is more often emphasized in the CCP's discourse, ""security"" has replaced stability. This represents a variable from the outside and has been identified as a risk by the CCP.
Therefore, in the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session, it appeared that ""the ""Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions must be strictly governed in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law, and the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao should be maintained. The legal system for safeguarding national security in the special administrative region should be established."" And the implementation mechanism is widely believed to be a signal that Beijing will take austerity measures against Hong Kong.
In the 13 areas that need to be ""adhered and perfected"" set by the Fourth Plenary Session, ""one country, two systems"" has been included, with the objectives of both Hong Kong and Macao and Taiwan. Nowadays, the plenary session of Hong Kong's ""one country, two systems"" policy has chosen a ""perfect"" approach. Although it is fully in line with the CCP's thinking mode, the effects that may be triggered in the future are worthy of observation.
However, in the face of the economic recession, China’s domestic hidden risks, the Fourth Plenary Session did not respond directly. It only included the “socialist basic economic system” in one of the 13 areas that required “persistence and perfection” and reiterated that Xi Jinping The ""two unwavering"" proposed: unswervingly consolidate and develop the public sector of the economy, and unswervingly encourage, support and guide the development of the non-public economy.
Compared with the power struggles and policy transitions that have often occurred in the Central Plenary Session in the past, the central plenary session of the Chinese Communist Party since the late 1990s has obviously fewer motions outside the set agenda. In other words, more than 20 years of the Central Plenary Session, more and more according to the script.
In particular, nowadays, under the rule of Xi Jinping, whose power is set in the party and power is forced to Mao Zedong, it is even more difficult for the Central Plenary to perform without the script. (Editor: Lin Kelun) 1081101
