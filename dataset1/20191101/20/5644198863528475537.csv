U.S. President Donald Trump and other administration officials had looked toward the Nov. 11-17 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit as a possible venue to sign the deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping before Chile this week canceled its plan to host the international summit.
""Hopefully we can resurrect a date right in that range,"" Ross told the television network, adding that the question of a new location remained.
Lead trade negotiators from both the United States and Chine are expected to speak by telephone on Friday as Ross prepared separately to travel to Asia for a three-day summit of Southeast Asian nations in Thailand.
""There will some transactions announced - some very good-sized transactions - announced while I'm on this trip,"" he said, but gave no other details.
