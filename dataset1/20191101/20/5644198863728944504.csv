The Contra Costa County Sheriff's office said four people died in the shooting and several other people were injured. The sheriff's office did not identify the victims or any suspects, saying more information would be released later on Friday.
Video footage broadcast by ABC7 News showed a person on a stretcher being loaded into an ambulance and young people who appeared to be party guests, including some in costumes, walking in the street outside the house.
