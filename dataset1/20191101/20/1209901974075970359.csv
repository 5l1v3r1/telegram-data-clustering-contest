Kim XO, helps to keep you looking good on Fashion Fridays on the Black Press Media Network

01 Nov 2019, 20:10

This Fashion Friday celebrity stylist Kim XO Appelt takes us into the closet of YouTuber Sunny Lenarduzzi.
Kim removes everything out of Sunny’s closet in order to find the simple basics that are easy to style.
From belts to shoes, to bags, Appelt organizes everything into piles; the yes, the no and the maybe.
While going through the closet, Sunny questions Kim on how to wear certain items that might end up in the yes pile.
Kim lends her expertise to ensure Sunny keeps the items that she will get the most out of, from keeping returning trends to ditching clothes she hasn’t worn in more than a year.
Watch the video below to find out more.



Appelt is a personal and celebrity stylist with years in the fashion industry and has become a go-to expert on all things fashion.

She produces new videos every week to help her thousands of YouTube subscribers turn a shabby look into run-way chic. She also has a strong social media following with more than 58,000 followers on Instagram.
Her passion to help clients find their own style, and her ability to see trends and pull together key pieces, have led the way to a successful styling career.



How to walk in high heels? What’s the best way, to tie your Converse shoes? How to pull off a baseball cap? Appelt has you covered.
