（中央社華盛頓31日綜合外電報導）根據熟知通訊軟體WhatsApp公司調查的消息人士，多個美國盟邦的高階政府官員今年稍早被針對臉書（Facebook）旗下這款應用程式漏洞的駭客鎖定，進而接管用戶手機。
熟知WhatsApp對這些違法行為內部調查的消息人士表示，在已知受害者中，有5大洲、至少20國的重要政府及軍事官員。他們說，許多被害者來自美國盟邦。
駭客入侵政府高階官員手機的數量較此前報導的還多，代表WhatsApp網路被駭恐會帶來廣泛政治和外交後果。
臉書所有的通訊軟體巨擘WhatsApp上月29日對以色列駭客工具開發公司NSO集團（NSO Group）提告。
WhatsApp指控，NSO集團利用這款應用程式的伺服器漏洞，打造並販售駭客平台，在今年4月29日至5月10日間，幫助顧客駭入至少1400名用戶的手機。
被駭的WhatsApp用戶總數可能更高。駭客目標之一的倫敦人權律師寄給路透社的照片顯示，有人4月1日試圖駭進他的手機。
NSO曾表示，只將間諜軟體販售給政府顧客。目前尚不清楚誰使用軟體駭入官員手機。
知情人士表示，部分受害者在美國、阿拉伯聯合大公國、巴林、墨西哥、巴基斯坦與印度。（譯者：侯文婷/核稿：陳政一）1081101

The number of hackers invading the government's high-ranking officials has more than previously reported, and the fear of the WhatsApp network is likely to have widespread political and diplomatic consequences.
Facebook's all communications software giant WhatsApp filed a lawsuit against the Israeli hacker tool development company NSO Group on the 29th of last month.
WhatsApp alleged that the NSO Group used the server vulnerability of the application to build and sell hacker platforms, helping customers break into the mobile phone of at least 1,400 users between April 29 and May 10.
The total number of users of WhatsApp may be higher. A photo of a London human rights lawyer sent to Reuters by one of the hacker targets showed that someone tried to break into his cell phone on April 1.
The NSO has said that it only sells spyware to government customers. It is not clear who uses software to break into official mobile phones.
People familiar with the matter said that some of the victims were in the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Mexico, Pakistan and India. (Translator: Hou Wenting / Approved: Chen Zhengyi) 1081101
