【宋神掌將登板】參選重大訊號出現　「大內高手」宋楚瑜即將出征
01 Nov 2019, 05:06 by 周怡孜, 楊子磊
2020年總統選戰白熱化，國、民兩黨參選人各自就位後，手握大選「門票」的親民黨也即將掀開底牌，公布總統提名人選。本刊調查，親民黨主席宋楚瑜4度參選總統的重大訊號已經浮現，橘營將在下週公布首波區域立委提名名單，為宋接下來的登場，預先暖場的意味不言而喻。
本刊掌握，親民黨上週召開決策會議商討立委選戰佈局，會中拍板，下週將召開記者會，對外公布第1波立委名單，以六都區域為主。橘營人士透露，在區域立委提名公布後，距離宋楚瑜登場的時機已十分接近，黨內目前對宋4度參選也均有共識。
知情人士指出，親民黨高層近日已委託民調公司，替宋楚瑜參選做各方評估，民調結果顯示，目前在總統蔡英文及國民黨總統參選人韓國瑜2方對決下，仍有近35%未表態選民，而在這個局勢下，若第3組總統人選是宋的話，除了名次未必墊底，甚至有一搏勝選的空間。
該人士表示，這份民調結果，已成為宋楚瑜再度披掛上陣的重要關鍵，「他看完民調後，對於參選很有信心」，並評估再度參選總統，將大有可為。
依照中選會時程規劃，總統、副總統連署結果將在11月13日公布，但目前正進行連署的前副總統呂秀蓮，連署情況似乎不樂觀。而11月18日至22日則是總統、副總統候選人登記期間，目前可望預估的第3組總統人馬，宋楚瑜已呼之欲出。

After the 2020 presidential election campaign is heated up, and the two-party candidates in the country and the people are in place, the People First Party, which holds the ""tickets"" of the general election, will soon open a hole to announce the presidential nominees. In this survey, the benevolent Party Chairman James Soong’s four-time election to the president’s major signal has emerged. The Orange Camp will announce the first wave of regional legislators’ nominations next week, which will be the next stage for Song’s appearance. The pre-warming effect is self-evident.
In this journal, the People First Party held a decision-making meeting last week to discuss the layout of the legislators' election campaign. The conference will be held in the middle of the week. A press conference will be held next week to announce the list of the first wave of legislators. According to the Orange Camp, after the nomination of the regional legislators, the timing of Song Chuyu’s debut is very close. The party currently has a consensus on the 4th election.
People familiar with the matter pointed out that the senior people of the People First Party have recently entrusted the polling company to conduct evaluations for James Soong's candidacy. The results of the poll show that there are still nearly 35 under the presidential match between President Tsai Ing-wen and the KMT presidential candidate. % did not express voters, and in this situation, if the third group of presidential candidates is Song, in addition to rankings may not be the bottom, there is even a room for victory.
The person said that the result of this poll has become an important key to James Soong's re-enactment. ""After reading the polls, he is very confident in the election,"" and assessing the re-election of the president will be promising.
According to the schedule of the election, the results of the presidential and vice-presidents will be announced on November 13, but the former vice president, Annette Lu, who is currently in the process of co-ordination, seems to be not optimistic. From November 18 to 22, during the registration of the president and vice president candidates, the third group of presidents who are currently expected to be estimated, James Soong has come to the fore.
