综指超卖 马股挫7.5点
01 Nov 2019, 05:55 by Syahirah Syed Jaafar
（吉隆坡1日讯）美中贸易谈判不稳定，加上分析员指综指处于超卖区间，导致富时隆综指半天跌7.5点或0.47%。
马六甲证券私人有限公司今日在报告中指出：“马股在过去数周上涨了大约3%，现在处于超卖区间与回调。中美贸易欠稳也造成了套利活动。”
截至中午12点30分，富时隆综指报1590.48点。富时隆综指昨日以1597.98点挂收，涨17.98点或1.14%。
半天成交量达17亿3000万股，值7亿2339万令吉，因大众银行（Public Bank Bhd）及丰隆金融集团（Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd）等综指成份股膺十大下跌股。
受美中贸易不明朗的影响，马股今日追踪美国周四隔夜下滑。
路透社报导，美国股市周四收低，因围绕中美可能达成贸易协议的前后不一言论盖过苹果（Apple）和脸书（Facebook）强劲业绩报告的影响。
与贸易有关的各种信号让投资者有理由保持谨慎，此前彭博社的一篇报导称，中国官员对是否可能与华盛顿和美国总统Donald Trump达成全面长期贸易协议表示怀疑。
但Trump后来表示，两国将很快宣布签署“第一阶段”贸易协议的地点。此前，智利取消了原定于11月中旬举行的亚太经合组织（APEC）峰会，原计划将在峰会会议间隙签署协议。

KLCI overselling 787 points
01 Nov 2019, 05:55 by Syahirah Syed Jaafar
KUALA LUMPUR (April 1): The US-China trade talks were unstable, and analysts said the KLCI was in the oversold range, causing the FBM KLCI to fall 7.5 points or 0.47% for half a day.
Malacca Securities Pte Ltd said in its report today: ""The Malaysian stock market has risen by about 3% in the past few weeks and is now in an oversold range and a correction. The turmoil in Sino-US trade has also led to arbitrage activities.""
As of 12:30, the Fu Shilong KLCI reported 1590.48 points. The FTSE KLCI closed at 1,597.98 points yesterday, up 17.98 points or 1.14%.
Half-day trading volume reached 1.73 billion shares, valued at RM723.39 million, due to the decline of the top ten constituent stocks such as Public Bank Bhd and Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd.
Affected by the uncertainty of US-China trade, the Malaysian stock market today tracked the US downturn overnight.
Reuters reported that the US stock market closed lower on Thursday, as the impact of the strong performance reports of Apple and Facebook over the remarks surrounding the possible trade agreement between China and the United States.
Trade-related signals give investors reason to be cautious, after a Bloomberg report said Chinese officials expressed doubts about the possibility of reaching a comprehensive long-term trade agreement with Washington and US President Donald Trump.
But Trump later said that the two countries will soon announce the location of the ""first phase"" trade agreement. Earlier, Chile canceled the APEC summit scheduled to be held in mid-November, and it was planned to sign an agreement at the summit meeting.
