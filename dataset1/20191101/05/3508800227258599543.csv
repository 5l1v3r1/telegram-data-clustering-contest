北京放風在澳門簽貿易協議、取代香港地位，但可能是個「大整蠱」

我們想讓你知道的是有報導指中國已提議以澳門取代智利，作為中美貿易戰首階段協議的簽署地點。這一消息令筆者身邊一些澳門朋友為之振奮，認為這是讓國際認識澳門的好機會，甚至有望取代香港地位。

智利宣布取消舉辦原定11月在該國首都聖地牙哥召開的亞太經合組織（APEC）峰會。由於中美兩國原預計會在峰會期間簽署首階段貿易協議，兩國改為什麼時間、到什麼地方簽署，美國總統特朗普和中國國家主席習近平又會否會晤，無疑備受矚目。
美國霍士新聞（Fox News）記者Edward Lawrence於Twitter表示，中國已提議以澳門取代智利，作為中美貿易戰首階段協議的簽署地點。這一消息令筆者身邊一些澳門朋友為之振奮，認為這是讓國際認識澳門的好機會，甚至有望取代香港地位；親建制的香港《經濟日報》也發文，形容此舉「對香港有3大啟示」，例如展示中央強力支持澳門發展等。
然而，澳門成為中美貿易協議簽署地、舉辦「習特會」的機會都可謂微乎其微。先不論澳門有沒有這個能力，從美方和特朗普的立場思考，自然不可能首先在中國的境內簽署貿易協議。特朗普一直聲稱在中美貿易戰中佔主導地位，也一直強調貿易戰對美國有利，又怎會願意在中國的國土簽署首階段協議呢？
如果真要在中美兩國的國土簽署協議，那美方想必也會要求「先美後中」，要求先在美國簽署首階段協議，比如關島等的海外領地，然後再在中國簽署第二階段協議。從中方的角度考量如是，「先美後中」會顯得弱勢，這選項顯然也不太可能。故此，中美雙方最終很可能仍會於第三國簽署協議，以達到對等、公平目的。對照首兩次的「特金會」，就在新加坡或越南等雙方均可接受的國家舉行。

實際上，中方提議由澳門取代智利的消息最初由Edward Lawrence在Twitter公開，這一點也很值得思考。他的消息來源是什麼呢？很可能正是北京宣傳系統故意借助他「放風」，突顯支持澳門發展之餘，展示中央隨時可以用澳門取代香港的位置。但將「放風」的任務交給外媒記者而非中國官媒，一來顯示北京也知道此建議不可能實現，二來是其放風對象是香港，或是其他國家，而不是內地人民。
類似的做法其實之前也有不少。比如，澳門打算成立以人民幣計價結算交易所的消息高調傳出，被解讀為有意取代或分薄香港國際金融中心的地位；中央政府8月宣布在深圳建設「社會主義先行示範區」，央視主播就暗示是要「示範」給香港看。至於澳門或深圳能否取代香港？相關分析已有很多，筆者就不再多花筆墨了。

在澳門簽貿易協議這項提議的象徵意議遠大於實際意義，但如果真的「奇蹟」在澳門舉辦呢？那對澳門政府和澳門人來說可能是一個「大整蠱」。雖然澳門財力雄厚，成本方面不是問題，但卻缺欠缺舉辦大型國際會議的經驗，籌備時間更不到一個月，最終安排失當可能性相信大，揚威海外反會變成國際笑話。加上澳門地少人多，街道狹窄，要舉辦中美元首級別的會晤，封路等保安安排的規模可想而知；而規模不大的機場，能否在應付日常起降的情況下迎接中美官員，亦成一大疑問。

Beijing releases a trade agreement in Macau to replace Hong Kong's status, but it may be a ""big deal""
01 Nov 2019, 05:44 by readers


What we want you to know is that there are reports that China has proposed to replace Chile with Macao as the signing point for the first phase of the Sino-US trade war. This news has inspired some Macao friends around the author to think that this is a good opportunity for the international community to understand Macao and even hope to replace Hong Kong's status.

Chile announced the cancellation of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit scheduled to take place in November, the capital of the country, in Santiago. Since China and the United States were originally expected to sign the first-phase trade agreement during the summit, when the two countries changed their time and where they signed, whether US President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet again will undoubtedly attract much attention.
Fox Law reporter Edward Lawrence said on Twitter that China has proposed to replace Chile with Macao as the signing point for the first phase of the Sino-US trade war. This news has inspired some Macao friends around the author to think that this is a good opportunity for the international community to understand Macao. It is even expected to replace Hong Kong's status. The pro-established Hong Kong Economic Daily also issued a document describing the move as ""there are three major cities in Hong Kong."" Revelation, for example, showing that the central government strongly supports the development of Macao.
However, Macao's chances of becoming a signing place for the Sino-US trade agreement and holding the ""Study Conference"" are negligible. Regardless of whether Macao has this ability or not, from the standpoint of the US and Trump, it is naturally impossible to first sign a trade agreement in China. Trump has always claimed to be dominant in the Sino-US trade war. He has always stressed that the trade war is good for the United States. How can he be willing to sign the first phase agreement in China's territory?
If it is really necessary to sign an agreement in the land of China and the United States, then the United States will certainly demand that ""the United States should be followed by the United States"", requiring that the first phase agreement be signed in the United States, such as overseas territories such as Guam, and then the second phase will be signed in China. protocol. From the perspective of the Chinese side, the ""first beauty and the middle"" will appear to be weak. This option is obviously not possible. Therefore, it is very likely that China and the United States will eventually sign an agreement in a third country to achieve reciprocity and fairness. The first two ""Special Gold Clubs"" will be held in countries where both Singapore and Vietnam are acceptable.

In fact, the Chinese proposal to replace Chile by Macao was originally published by Edward Lawrence on Twitter, which is also worth considering. What is his source? It is very likely that the Beijing Propaganda System deliberately used his ""wind-out"" to highlight the support for Macao's development and show that the Central Government can replace Hong Kong with Hong Kong at any time. However, the task of ""leading the wind"" was handed over to foreign media reporters instead of Chinese official media. It was revealed that Beijing also knew that this proposal could not be realized. Secondly, it was targeted at Hong Kong or other countries, not the mainland people. .
A similar approach has actually been done before. For example, Macao intends to set up a high-profile news of the RMB-denominated settlement exchange, which is interpreted as intentionally replacing or diversifying the status of Hong Kong's international financial center; the central government announced in August that it will build a ""socialist pioneering demonstration zone"" in Shenzhen, CCTV anchor The implication is to ""demonstration"" to Hong Kong. Can Macau or Shenzhen replace Hong Kong? There have been a lot of correlation analysis, and the author will not spend more time.

The symbolic idea of signing a trade agreement in Macau is far greater than the actual meaning, but what if the ""miracle"" is really held in Macau? That may be a ""big deal"" for the Macau government and the Macao people. Although Macao has strong financial resources and costs are not a problem, it lacks the experience of holding large-scale international conferences. The preparation time is less than one month. The possibility of improper arrangement is believed to be great. Yangwei’s overseas reversal will become an international joke. In addition, there are a large number of people in Macao, and the streets are narrow. It is necessary to hold the first-level meeting of the US dollar. The scale of security arrangements such as road closures can be imagined. The small airport can meet the daily take-off and landing situation. Chinese and American officials have also become a big question.
