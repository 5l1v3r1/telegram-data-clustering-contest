How You Can Help California Wildfire Victims, Even if You Don’t Live There

01 Nov 2019, 05:02

Firefighters in California have spent weeks battling intense wildfires, including the massive Kincade fire. Unfortunately, on Thursday, things took a turn for the worse.
On Halloween night, new fires erupted, including the Maria fire, which has already burned more than 8,000 acres. Power has been cut in some areas to prevent new blazes, more than 200,000 people have been ordered to evacuate, and Sonoma’s Kincade fire has now burned about 78,000 acres (i.e., twice the size of San Francisco), according to the California Department of Forestry & Fire Protection.
While California has always been prone to fires and thankfully no one has died, CBS News reports that California fires are only going to get worse and will only continue to devolve because of climate change.

“This is only the beginning,” former California Gov. Jerry Brown told Politico a few days ago. “This is only a taste of the horror and terror that will occur in decades.”
According to the United States wildfires map, below, from Ersi, a geographic information system software company based in California, the location of the California wildfires varies but centers heavily northwest of Los Angeles and in northern areas of the state.
It can be disheartening to watch the destruction from afar, but even if you don’t live anywhere near California, there are things you can do to help wildfire victims. Check out these options and do what you can.
Help evacuated people find housing

The Kincade fire is by far the largest wildfire burning in California right now, so the United Way set up an Emergency Relief and Recover Fund for victims. Check it out right here.
For more general shelter aid, you can also donate to The American Red Cross and/or the Petaluma People Services Center in Northern California.

Check on anyone who lives in the area

Facebook has enabled a Safety Check for the California wildfires in Sonoma County specifically. If you’re in the area, mark yourself safe, and if you know someone who lives in Cali, you can check on them here.
The Red Cross has also created a Safe and Well List for both the Kincade fire and more general California fires. Mark yourself safe or check on loved ones here.

Donate to a food bank

The Redwood Empire Food Bank is helping to feed people while the Kincade fire burns, and it needs donations. Here is the list of locations currently accepting food donations. (They ask that you please call in advance just to make sure it’s safe before you go.)
The Redwood Empire Food Bank’s regular volunteer shifts have been canceled, but if you are still in the area and can help, email volunteers@refb.org.
You can also donate food and/or money to the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank and Sonoma Family Meal.

Save the animals who live there

Consider contributing to an animal rescue fund or disaster response fund at a local California animal shelter, like the Humane Society of Ventura County, the Los Angeles County Animal Care Foundation, or Sonoma County Animal Services.

Open up an Airbnb to evacuees for free if you’re in the area

Airbnb’s Open Homes program is offering free temporary housing to any Kincade fire evacuees for the next week. If you operate an Airbnb in California, you can sign up to open your home to people who need it here.

Do what you can to fight climate change

CNN broke down how the climate crisis is directly fueling the California wildfires, which is yet another reason to take it seriously. The World Wildlife Fund has a handy outline of what you can do to fight climate change, but here are some highlights: Switch to green power, drive more efficiently, plan and combine trips whenever you can, carpool, and push for legislative change by reaching out to your congressional reps.
