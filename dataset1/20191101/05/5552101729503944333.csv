搞叛逆才進演藝圈　坣娜自爆「不是很愛唱歌的人」
01 Nov 2019, 05:48 by 張詠淇
近期大多投身在公益活動，睽違電視節目多年的歌手坣娜，日前在八大《就愛瘋音樂》多次積極邀約，並期待和老朋友黃小琥碰面的雙重因素下，難得點頭在螢幕前現身演唱「奢求」「一廂情願」等經典歌曲。而當在節目中回首演藝之路時，坣娜竟自爆「我並不是很愛唱歌的人！」讓主持人黃小琥、林俊逸十分驚訝。
坣娜透露自己並非因為喜歡唱歌而踏入歌壇，而是因緣際會在朋友的引薦下與當時的經紀公司接觸，一開始坣娜並沒有強烈的意願要和對方合作，卻因為父親嚴禁她和經紀公司簽約，反倒促成坣娜踏入歌壇，「我父親覺得我還小，所以不准，但那次的不准，激發我心裡面的第一次反抗，我就跟我父親說，我一定要簽約！」沒想到向來溫順乖巧的女兒居然會叛逆，這讓她父親很訝異，只好勉為其難的順從坣娜的想法，「我就這樣進入演藝圈，最終的目的其實是我可以賺錢養家，所以唱歌對我來講，一直是個工作。」
雖然演唱作品沒有非常多，但好歌聲深獲許多粉絲喜愛，而除了歌手身分，坣娜還曾跨足演戲，「我第1年我是歌手出身，確實做了歌手的事情，在秀場唱歌，但是我在同年我就拍廣告，然後拍電影拍連續劇，大概拍了一部戲之後，我再錄第2張專輯，我覺得我自己對於歌的想法不一樣，所以我從第2張專輯，我都是在想10首歌就是10部電影，以這樣子來唱歌。」 坣娜也分享去新加坡錄第2張專輯時，還在工作人員的安排下，與當時同公司的黃小琥初次見面，相對於坣娜的印象深刻，黃小琥則一時沒有這段回憶的頭緒，讓主持搭檔林俊逸忍不住打趣說「我們女主持人不記得的事很多，記得的很少。」笑翻全場。

In the face of rebellion, I entered the entertainment industry. I blew myself up. ""I don't really love singing.""

Recently, most of the singers who have been involved in public welfare activities and have been swearing for TV programs for many years, have been actively invited in the Eighth ""Love Music"" and look forward to sing in front of the screen with the double factor of meeting with old friend Huang Xiaohu. Classic songs such as ""luxury"" and ""wishful wish"". When looking back on the road of performing arts in the show, Dina actually blew herself ""I don't really like singing people!"" The host Huang Xiaohu and Lin Junyi were very surprised.
Dina revealed that she did not enter the music because she likes to sing, but because she was contacted by the brokerage company under the recommendation of a friend, she did not have a strong willingness to cooperate with the other party, but her father forbids her and the broker. When the company signed the contract, it turned into a singer. ""My father thinks that I am still young, so I am not allowed, but that time is not allowed, which inspired my first resistance in my heart. I told my father that I must Signing a contract!"" I didn't expect her gentle and well-behaved daughter to be rebellious. This made her father very surprised. She had to follow the advice of Dina. ""I just entered the entertainment industry. The ultimate goal is that I can make money to support my family. Singing has always been a job for me.""
Although there are not many singing works, the good singing is deeply loved by many fans. In addition to the singer's identity, Dina has also stepped into acting. ""I was a singer in the first year. I did a singer and sang at the show. But I made an advertisement in the same year, and then made a movie to shoot a series. After I took a movie, I recorded the second album. I think my own idea for the song is different, so I am from the second album. I am thinking that 10 songs are 10 movies, so I can sing in this way.” Dina also shared her second album when she went to Singapore. Under the arrangement of the staff, she met with the company’s Huang Xiaohu for the first time. Compared with Dina's impressive impression, Huang Xiaohu did not have the clue of this memory for a while, so that the host partner Lin Junyi couldn't help but joked that ""our hostess doesn't remember a lot of things, and she remembers very little.""
