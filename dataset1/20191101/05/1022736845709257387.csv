01 Nov 2019, 05:21 by RFI

Kundi la Islamic State limethibitisha kifo cha kiongozi wake Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, aliyeuawa katika operesheni ya jeshi la Marekani nchini Syria, na kumtangaza mrithi wake kwa kutishia Marekani kulipiza kisasi.

Uthibitisho wa kifo cha Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ulitolewa katika ujumbe wa sauti uliowekwa kwenye programu ya Telegraph. ""Enyi Waislamu, Enyi Wanajihadi, askari wa IS (...), tunahuzunishwa na kifo cha mkuu wa waumini Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi"", ametangaza Abu Hamza Al-Qurachi, aliyetambulishwa kama msemaji mpya wa kundi lenye msimamo mkali la IS.
Uthibitisho huu unakuja siku tano baada ya Donald Trump kutangaza kifo cha Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi katika operesheni ya jeshi la Marekani nchini Syria. Katika sauti yake ya dakika saba iliyorekodiwa, msemaji mpya wa kundi hili la wanajihadi ametoa wito wa kulipiza kisasi kwa kifo hicho, haswa akitishia Marekani kulipiza kisasi na kumuita rais wa nchi hiyo ""mzee mpumbavu.""
""Marekani usifurahi na kujigamba, anakuja mtu ambaye atakufanya usahau mambo uliomfanyia,"" Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi na ""kukukatikiza kiu cha mabaya unayofanyia ulimwengu(...) ambapo utakuja kuonekana mtu mwenye unyonge na masikitiko makubwa"" , ameongeza Abu Hamza Al-Qurachi.
Kundi la Islamic State limebaini katika ujumbe huo wa sauti kwamba mkutano wa mashauriano wa kundi hilo, Majlis al-Shura, umeapa kumtii na kumuunga mkono Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurachi, ""kiongozi mkuu wa waumini"" na ""khalifa mpya wa Waislamu"". Jina hili halikuwa limetajwa miongoni mwa watu waliopewa nafasi kubwa kumrithi Baghdadi.
""Hatujui mengi kuhusu yeye, isipokuwa tu kwamba yeye ndiye jaji mkuu wa IS na ndiye kiongozi wa Mamlaka ya
Sharia,"" Hicham al-Hachemi, mtaalam wa masuala ya kijihadi ameliambia shirika la Habari la AFP.
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, kiongozi wa kundi la Kijihad la Islamic State (IS) na mtu ambaye alikuwa akisakwa sana duniani , alijiua kufuatia uvamizi wa Marekani uliotekelezwa na kikosi maalum cha wanajeshi kaskazini magharibi mwa Syria.
Kiongozi huyo aliyejiita 'Kalifa Ibrahim' alikuwa amewekewa dola milioni 25 kwa mtu yeyote ambaye angefichua maficho yake na alikuwa akisakwa na Marekani na washirika wake tangu kuanzishwa kwa kundi la IS miaka mitano iliopita.
Baghdadi aliapishwa kuwa kiongozi wa kundi hilo mwaka 2014 wakati ambao wanamgambo wa IS walipoweza kuishinda Iraq na Syria na kuanzisha utawala wao mpya wao.

01 Nov 2019, 05:21 by RFI

The Islamic State group has confirmed the death of its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, killed in a US military operation in Syria, and announced his successor for threatening US retaliation.

Proof of the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was provided in an audio message posted on the Telegraph program. ""O Muslims, You jihadists, IS (...) soldiers, we are saddened by the death of the great believer Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi"", announced Abu Hamza Al-Qurachi, identified as the new spokesman of the radical IS group.
This confirmation comes five days after Donald Trump announced the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a US military operation in Syria. In his seven-minute audio recording, a new spokesman for the jihadist group has called for revenge for the death, specifically threatening the US to retaliate and calling the country's president ""an old fool.""
""United States not be happy and proud, here comes a man who will make you forget what you did for him,"" Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and ""quench the thirst for evil in the world (...) where you will come to appear weak and sad"", added Abu Hamza Al-Qurachi .
The Islamic State group revealed in the audio message that the group's consultative meeting, Majlis al-Shura, has vowed to obey and support Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurachi, ""the great leader of the believers"" and the ""new caliph of the Muslims"". . This name was not mentioned among the people who were given the great privilege to inherit Baghdadi.
""We do not know much about him, except that he is the chief justice of IS and is the leader of the Authority
Sharia, ""Hicham al-Hachemi, a jihadist expert told AFP.
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Jihad Islamic State (IS) group and the world's most wanted man, committed suicide following an American invasion by a special military force in northwestern Syria.
The self-proclaimed 'Caliph Ibrahim' had been earmarked $ 25 million for anyone who would disclose his secrets and had been wanted by the United States and its allies since the formation of the IS party five years ago.
Baghdadi was sworn in as leader of the group in 2014 when IS militants were able to defeat Iraq and Syria and establish their new regime.
