Junius Ho sues 3 pro-democracy lawmakers for libel over remarks at water cannon demonstration

If you thought fiery pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho — currently facing a potential lawsuit and newly doctorate-less after his alma mater stripped his honorary degree — might take a break from the spotlight and make some time for quiet introspection, well, buddy, you don’t know Junius Ho.
According to NOW TV News, Ho has announced he is suing lawmakers Dennis Kwok, Claudia Mo, and Lam Cheuk-ting — the man behind the legal action against Ho — for chanting “Junius Ho, triad” at a police demonstration of their new water cannon trucks on Aug. 12.
The TV station reported that in a High Court filing, Ho said the remarks were unfounded and not true, and demanded damages and an injunction to prevent the trio from making similar statements.
The remarks in question were made at an event at the police tactical unit in Fanling attended by members of the Legislative Council. Kwok, Lam, and Mo staged a protest during the demonstration by holding placards accusing the police of “attempted murder.” Ho at one point called the protesting lawmakers “bloody idiots,” as he is wont to do.
In a video filmed by Ming Pao, some lawmakers can be heard saying “Junius Ho, triad.” Pro-democracy lawmaker Au Nok-hin can also be heard yelling to police “sir, this guy is a triad.”



Ho has been accused of being in cahoots with the triads ever since a video was released of him shaking hands with some of the white-shirted men connected to the July 21 attack at Yuen Long MTR, in which pro-democracy protesters, commuters, and journalists were beaten by a mob armed with metal rods and bamboo sticks.
Some of those later arrested in connection with the attack had links to triads.
According to an on.cc report from late last night, a 61-year-old man is the latest to be arrested on rioting charges in connection with the incident — often referred to as 721 — bringing the total number of people arrested to 32.
Ho has continued to deny any involvement with the 721 incident, and last week accused Lam — one of the people he’s suing — of inciting the attack.
Lam, who was one of the people injured in the 721 incident, responded on Monday by saying he would initiate legal proceedings unless Ho retracted his comments and payed tens of thousands of dollars in damages and legal fees.
