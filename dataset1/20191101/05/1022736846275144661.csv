Baraza la Wawakilishi nchini Marekani limepitisha azimio linaloweka sheria za utaratibu wa kumng'atua madarakani Donald Trump. Hatua mpya rasmi katika maagizo yanayoendelea kufanywa dhidi ya rais wa Marekani.

Chama cha Democratic, ambacho kinashikilia viti vingi katika Baraza la Wawakilishi nchini Marekani, hakikupata usumbufu wa kupitisha azimio hilo, na hivyo kufungua hatua mpya katika uchunguzi wa kesi ya mazungumzo ya simu baina ya rais wa Marekani Donald Trump na mwenzake wa Ukraine.
Mazungumzo hayo ya simu yamewafanya wabunge kutoka chama cha upinzani cha Democrats kuanzisha uchunguzi rasmi wenye lengo la kumng'oa madarakani bw Trump.
Wabunge wa Democrats wanamshutumu Trump kwa kutaka usaidizi kutoka kwa taifa la kigeni ili kumuangamiza hasimu wake wa kisiasa.
Mara tu baada ya kura kupigwa, Donald Trump alionyesha kutoridhika kwake kwenye ukurasa wake wa Twitter.



Taarifa ya White House inathibitisha kuwa, mnamo Julai 25, Trump alimuomba rais Volodymyr Zelenski kumchunguza makamo wa rais wa zamani wa Marekani Joe Biden ambaye anasaka tiketi ya urais kupitia chama cha Democrats, ambaye mtoto wake alikuwa akifanya kazi na shirika la gesi la Ukraine.
Bw Trump anakanusha kuwa alizuia msaada wa kijeshi kwa Ukraine kama njia ya kuishinikiza nchi hiyo kumsaidia kumchafua adui wake wa kisiasa, bw Biden.
Taarifa juu ya mazungumzo hayo ya simu ilitolewa na mtoa taarifa wa siri.
Zaidi ya miaka 20 baada ya kura ya mwisho ambayo ilifungua utaratibu kama huo dhidi ya Bill Clinton, mpango huo ulipitishwa kwa kura 232 dhidi ya kura 196.
Wabunge wa Chama cha Republican wamepinga mpango huo na kuonyesha uungwaji wao mkono kwa Rais Donald Trump.
Hivi karibuni Bwana Trump alikiri kuwa alimzungumzia Joe Biden na Bwana Zelensky lakini akasema alikuwa tu akijaribu kuitaka Ulaya iingilie kati kutoa msaada kwa kuitishia kusitisha msaada wa kijeshi.

A compromise against Donald Trump: Democrats set the rules for order
01 Nov 2019, 05:40 by RFI

The US House of Representatives has passed a resolution that sets out the rules of order to oust Donald Trump. A new official action in the ongoing orders is being made against the US president.

The Democratic Party, which holds the most seats in the US House of Representatives, found no inconvenience to pass the resolution, thus opening up a new step in the investigation into a telephone conversation case between US President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart.
The phone call prompted MPs from the opposition Democrats to launch an official probe aimed at ousting Trump.
Democrats are accusing Trump of seeking support from a foreign nation to overthrow his political rivals.
Immediately after the vote was cast, Donald Trump expressed his dissatisfaction on his Twitter page.



The White House statement confirms that, on July 25, Trump asked president Volodymyr Zelenski to investigate former US president Joe Biden who is seeking a presidential ticket through the Democrats, whose son was working with the Ukrainian gas agency.
Mr Trump denies that he withdrew Ukraine's military support as a means of pressuring the country to help him pollute his political opponent, Mr Biden.
Information on the telephone conversation was provided by a confidential informant.
More than 20 years after the last ballot that opened such a system against Bill Clinton, the plan passed with 232 votes against 196 votes.
Members of the Republican Party have opposed the plan and expressed their support for President Donald Trump.
Recently Mr Trump admitted that he had talked to Joe Biden and Mr Zelensky but said he was just trying to get Europe to intervene to offer support by threatening to terminate military support.
