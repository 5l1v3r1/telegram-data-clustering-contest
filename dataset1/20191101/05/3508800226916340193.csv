只有死了，世人才開始緬懷她——雪莉的凋零
01 Nov 2019, 05:48 by Lo's Psychology


我們想讓你知道的是Amazon創始人Jeff Bezos曾說過：「我們的選擇會塑造我們的人生，而善良就是一種選擇。」在電腦熒幕後，在網路世界上的我們該如何選擇？



「雪崩時，沒有一片雪花是無辜的。」（No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible.）
由於南韓藝人雪莉（Sulli，本名崔真理）在生前的大膽作風，與其以童星身分出道時所維持的清純形象大相逕庭，所以一直在生前飽受網路霸凌之苦。2019年10月14日，備受爭議和壓力煎熬的雪莉選擇在自己的住所上吊自殺，結束了年僅25歲的短暫一生。而今距離雪莉的去世時隔已經兩個禮拜，但抑鬱症自殺，網路霸凌，網路暴力等事件帶來的陰霾不會消散。
「網路霸凌」（cyberbullying，又稱「網路欺凌」）常見於社交媒體或可互動（interactive）的網路平台，是一種電腦犯罪行為，形式多為語言暴力（筆者先前曾寫過一篇較為詳細的，解讀網路霸凌者的心理的貼文）。在《So you’ve been public shamed》（鄉民公審）一書中，作者Jon Ronson將「網路霸凌」解讀為一種公開羞辱的手段——在網路的世界裡，人們可以帶上匿名的面具，躲在電腦熒幕後面，幾近瘋狂集體羞辱某人，這種行為屬於一種群眾心理現象。
網民公開羞辱的對象可以包含任何人——從越界的公眾人物到犯錯的素人，即便被羞辱的對象道歉了，他們也依舊沒有機會和權力申辯，因為網路上留存的記錄並不會給予這些犯錯者重新振作起來的機會。很多時候，這種公開羞辱甚至會毀掉被羞辱者的一生，就像雪莉的死亡一樣。
網路的匿名性（Anonymity）很大程度助長了網民們集體對受害者進行公開羞辱的「勇氣」。「Anonymity」一詞，源自希臘語，意思是「沒有名字」，屬於一種人類特有的心理體驗——即使我們在世上都擁有不同的身分，但在特定情況下，我們可以選擇隱藏自己的身分並且匿名行動。
根據美國萊德大學心理學教授John Suler在著作《The Psychology of Cyberspace》（網路空間心理學）中的解釋，保持匿名的能力會直接影響用戶的在線行為，這種影響非常普遍，被稱為「在線抑製作用」（online dishibition effect）。「在線抑製作用」使得網民們產生一種現實與網路世界分離（disassociate）、出格行為並不會造成不良影響、過分言論不會受到追究的心理錯覺。
雪莉的死亡被多方解讀為抑鬱症自殺的結果，但在某種程度上，真正殺死雪莉的，是口不擇言，躲在鍵盤後面惡評攻擊的網路暴民，而這些網路暴民的幫兇，就是大肆渲染雪莉在社群媒體上的行為「放飛自我」、「性暗示」、「墮落」和「精神失常」，煽風點火的媒體。筆者之所以寫出這樣的言論，是出自於內心的憤慨——本該在最美的年齡綻放的雪莉，就這樣香消玉殞，讓人無比心痛與惋惜。
記得Amazon的創始人Jeff Bezos曾說過：「我們的選擇會塑造我們的人生，而善良就是一種選擇。（In the end, we are our choices. Kindness is an option.）」
在電腦熒幕後，在網路世界上的我們該如何作出選擇？希望雪莉的死能被大家銘記，因為「雪崩時，沒有一片雪花是無辜的。」
Be kind. 生而為人，請務必善良。

Only dead, the world began to remember her - Shirley's dying
01 Nov 2019, 05:48 by Lo's Psychology


What we want you to know is that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos once said: ""Our choices will shape our lives, and kindness is a choice."" After the computer screen, how do we choose in the online world?



""No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible.""
Because the South Korean artist Shirley (Sulli, whose real name is Cui Truth) was in a bold manner during his lifetime, he was suffering from the cyberbullying of his life when he was very different from the pure image he maintained when he was debuted as a child. On October 14, 2019, the controversial and stressful Shirley chose to hang himself at her home, ending a short life of only 25 years old. Now, Shirley’s death has been separated by two weeks, but the haze caused by depression, cyberbullying, and cyber violence will not dissipate.
""cyberbullying"" (also known as ""cyberbullying"") is commonly found on social media or interactive web platforms. It is a computer crime, and the form is mostly violent. (The author has previously written an article. More detailed, interpret the psychology of the Internet bully. In ""So you've been public shamed,"" author Jon Ronson interprets ""cyber bullying"" as a means of public humiliation - in the online world, people can bring anonymous Masks, hiding behind the computer screen, almost madly humiliating someone, this behavior belongs to a mass psychological phenomenon.
The public humiliation of netizens can include anyone—from public figures across the border to ordinary people who make mistakes. Even if the humiliated object apologizes, they still have no chance and power to argue, because the records kept on the Internet will not give these mistakes. The opportunity to rekindle. Many times, this public humiliation can even ruin the life of a humiliated person, just like Shirley’s death.
The anonymity of the Internet has greatly contributed to the courage of netizens to collectively humiliate victims. The word ""Anonymity"" comes from the Greek word for ""no name"" and belongs to a human-specific psychological experience - even though we have different identities in the world, in certain circumstances, we can choose to hide our identity. And anonymous action.
According to John Suler, a professor of psychology at Ryder University in the United States, in his book The Psychology of Cyberspace, the ability to remain anonymous directly affects the user's online behavior. This effect is very common and is called ""Online dishibition effect"". ""Online suppression"" enables netizens to create a psychological illusion that dissociation and outrageous behaviors do not cause adverse effects and excessive speech will not be pursued.
Shirley’s death was interpreted by many parties as the result of suicide in depression, but to a certain extent, the real killing of Shirley is a sneak peek at the Internet mob behind the keyboard. The accomplice of the mob is to smear Shirley's behavior in the social media, ""freeing self,"" ""sexual cues,"" ""fallen,"" and ""mental disorder."" The reason why the author wrote such a statement is from the inner indignation - Shirley, who should have bloomed at the most beautiful age, is so fragrant and jealous that people are so sad and sorry.
I remember that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos once said: ""Our choices will shape our lives, and goodness is a choice. (In the end, we are our choices. Kindness is an option.)""
How do we make choices in the online world behind the computer screen? I hope that Shirley’s death can be remembered by everyone, because ""in the case of an avalanche, no snowflake is innocent.""
Be kind. Be born, be sure to be kind.
