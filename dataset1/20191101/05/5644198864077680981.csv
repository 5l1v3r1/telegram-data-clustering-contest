The group urged the Hudson Bay's board to explore alternatives, and said it was ""aware of a number of strategic investors that are interested in participating in a process that is open and not constructed to benefit an insider.""
Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson's Bay earlier this month agreed to a sweetened CUS$1.9 billion (US$1.5 billion) offer from the shareholder group.
