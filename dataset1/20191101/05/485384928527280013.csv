Rugby World Cup final favourites England with the pressure on them ahead of South Africa clash in Japan
01 Nov 2019, 05:53 by Luke Pentony
Football was meant to come home to England at last year's FIFA World Cup, and while that did not go according to plan, its men's rugby union team finds itself on the cusp of global domination.
Coming off their stunning 19-7 triumph over the All Blacks in the semi-finals, Eddie Jones's squad seems destined to add a second Rugby World Cup crown to England's tally and its first since 2003.
Standing in its way is two-time champion South Africa, a team the Australian-born Jones helped to beat England in the 2007 final in France, and it will be the first meeting between the two since last November, when the English sneaked home 12-11 winners at Twickenham.

The Springboks advanced to the final in Yokohama via a gritty 19-16 victory over Wales and they are enjoying their underdog status while looking to become the first team in Rugby World Cup history to win the final despite losing a pool match.
If you've just noticed the Rugby World Cup is on and want to get up to speed, let us answer some of the pertinent — and not so pertinent — questions ahead of tomorrow night's final in Yokohama.
Who is favourite and why?
England deserves its listing as favourite and not just because it toppled the All Blacks, as that was not a surprise to any observer who has charted its progress since Jones was appointed as coach in late 2015.
England's road to the final

35-3 win vs Tonga
45-7 win vs USA
39-10 win vs Argentina

vs France cancelled

40-16 win vs Australia (quarter-final)
19-7 win vs New Zealand (semi-final)

Jones has overseen the development of a punishing defensive unit that has been at its best during the Rugby World Cup, as has been England's set-pieces.
He has a backline — well-marshalled by dual playmakers George Ford and captain Owen Farrell — that has the ability to pose a significant attacking threat and also at his disposal are several damaging ball-running forwards who can offload in the tackle, such as tighthead prop Kyle Sinckler.

Another area England has dominated is the breakdown, largely because of Jones's use of two openside flankers in Sam Underhill and Tom Curry, who he has nicknamed the ""kamikaze kids"".
How the Boks made the big dance

23-13 loss vs New Zealand
57-3 win vs Namibia
49-3 win vs Italy
66-7 win vs Canada
26-3 win vs Japan (quarter-final)
19-16 win vs Wales (semi-final)

Early in Jones's tenure there were media commentators who suggested England could do without even one traditional openside, yet the outstanding performances of Underhill and Curry in Japan have blown that theory out of the water.
The Springboks, who lost to the All Blacks in their opening pool match, will actually welcome the fact England is expected to win, and they won't mind that their playing style has been described as ""boring"" and ""not pretty"", but a lot will have to fall in their favour if they are to cause an upset.
Their massive forward pack must win the physical battle and get the upper hand in both the scrum and lineout, so as to utilise one of the best game managers in world rugby, five-eighth Handre Pollard.

Pollard is the key to ensuring centre Damian de Allende and the returning livewire winger Cheslin Kolbe are fed with ball and if the Springboks can unleash the pair they could find a crack in the much-vaunted England defensive line.
Springboks coach Rassie Erasmus would be mindful that the well-drilled England has dictated the pace of its matches so far in Japan. Disrupt England's flow and the men in white might just be thrown off what as proved to be a successful routine.
Who are the potential gamebreakers?
We don't want to say ""we told you so"", but we did tip Maro Itoje to play a prominent role at the Rugby World Cup and his man-of-the-match effort against the All Blacks in the semi-finals showcased his immense talent.
Itoje rose to the occasion in Yokohama with a devastating display of spot defence, three possession turnovers and a key lineout steal, while his spoiling of a New Zealand maul in the first half was also among a very full highlight reel.



Itoje's greatest strength is his ability to read the game, and nullifying his impact will be crucial for the Springboks if they are to lift the Webb Ellis Cup.
As pivotal as Itoje is to England, the role Faf de Klerk has to play as Springboks half-back will be just as important.
De Klerk fits perfectly into the Springboks' game plan with the way he expertly guides the Springboks forwards around the ground and uses the box kick, while he is an added attacking threat with ball in hand.

Standing at 172 centimetres tall, de Klerk also has those cheeky and annoying qualities — which all world-class number nines have — that can get in the face of opponents, just as hulking Wales lock Jake Ball found out in last Sunday night's semi-final.
If I'm an Aussie — who do I go for?
The Springboks might be the Southern Hemisphere's representative in the World Cup final and it is thought by many to be unfathomable for an Australian to support an English sporting team, but hear us out.
Not only is Jones an Australian but one of his assistants, attack coach Scott Wisemantel, is a countryman, while a name familiar to AFL fans is a vital cog in England's high-performance unit.
Former Adelaide Crows coach Neil Craig joined England's staff in late 2017, with Jones wanting to call upon not only his coaching experience but also his background in sports science.

Canberra Raiders coach Ricky Stuart made a well-publicised visit to the England camp in the lead-up to the quarter-final against the Wallabies and retired Australia rugby league international Jason Ryles has previously helped Jones with his side's defence.
We might be clutching at straws to highlight the Australian influence, but hey, if you want to support England then perhaps you have some reason.
What if I'm English — can I still join the bandwagon?
Come one, come all, as you are not alone.
England has always been able to call upon a loyal base of fans who follow the team when playing at Rugby World Cups or touring internationally, but its campaign in Japan took a bit of time to generate frenzied support back home.

The win over the All Blacks did the trick, although England football great and prominent media pundit Gary Lineker made a tongue-in-cheek reference to the significant rise in interest.



But Irish One Direction songbird Niall Horan was in no mood to tolerate England's growing legion of bandwagon supporters.



Some English have taken extreme measures to hop on board the bandwagon, like the punter who was ""four or five pints down"" after the semi-final victory when he paid 650 pounds for a flight to Japan, despite having no ticket to the final or any accommodation arranged.
