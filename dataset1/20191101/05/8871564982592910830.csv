Married Bangkok couple killed on moto in crash that sends car careening into wall
01 Nov 2019, 05:43 by Coconuts Bangkok
A married couple died on a motorcycle early this morning after colliding with a car in northeast Bangkok.
The man and woman were found dead on the sidewalk after hitting the Mazda, which lost control and plowed into a residence in Bangkok’s Khan Na Yao district, according to police.
The Mazda’s 22-year-old driver, Asawin Yeethow, told police that the motorcycle was driving the wrong way at about 5am in Soi Khu Bon 27 when it struck his vehicle, causing him to lose control and careen through a wall onto someone’s property. There were no witnesses to immediately corroborate his account.
Photos of the incident show the smashed front end of his vehicle entangled with the remains of the motorbike.



Khan Na Yao police said that Somsak Poonsri was dead on the sidewalk along with an unidentified woman believed to be his wife when they arrived at the scene.
Police said there were no witnesses to the crash and that their initial investigation found the dead couple resided in a low-income housing development near to where they died. The crash occurred on a curve of road and Somsak was – as Asawin described – believed to have been driving the wrong way on the road to reach the entrance of the soi.
Somsak and his wife are believed to have been launched from the motorcycle and onto the sidewalk, where they were found.
No drugs or alcohol were found in Mazda driver Asawin’s system. Police are currently checking security cameras in the area to find footage of the accident and interviewing witnesses in order to determine whose fault the accident was.
No charges have been filed thus far, and the couple’s body has been transported to the Police Hospital’s Institute of Forensic Medicine for autopsy, according to multiple reports.
