Corel’s PaintShop Pro app is now available for download from Microsoft Store. PaintShop Pro allows you to edit photos and create graphics using pro-level tools and features. You can download and enjoy this app with a paid subscription. Corel is offering the first month free. So, you can try the full featured product and cancel at any time before the free month is over at no cost.

PaintShop Pro features:


Choose from multiple workspaces to suit your project style and skill level.
Customize your workspace for maximum efficiency.
Use multiple Layers and Masks to make artistic photo compositions and graphic design projects.
Touch up your favorite photos with high precision selection or cloning tools and restore old photos with flaw removal effects.
Draw and paint with built-in brushes and drawing tools and use color palettes, gradients, patterns and picture tubes to take your designs to the next level.
Work with powerful adjustment tools to edit, crop, resize, remove noise, sharpen, enhance colors, use curves and levels to make your photos stand out.
Add text to images to create interesting projects, like a meme or a picture quote. Adjust fonts, size, style, alignment and more with a complete set of typography tools.
Try out intelligent one-step solutions and filters such as One-Step Photo Fix and Smart Photo Fix to take the guess work out of achieving the perfect photo.
Automatically correct distortions, vignetting and chromatic aberrations with the built-in lens correction.
Transform photos into a work of art with Artificial Intelligence and replicate the style of iconic artists with Pic-to-Painting.
Straighten a 360° photo with rotation or make it appear leveled. Remove and automatically replace the tripod in the image or produce an interesting ‘planet-like’ effect.
Enjoy complete control over your RAW images including before and after views and a large preview option.
Speed up common and repetitive tasks by scripting almost any action with the full-featured scripting engine.
Use makeover tools to eliminate red-eye, blemishes and unwanted lines, or smooth wrinkles, whiten teeth and even out skin tones.
Increase productivity with batch processing by applying adjustments to many photos at once.
Access a wide range of built-in templates to create collages, greeting cards, social media images, web banners, brochures and more.
