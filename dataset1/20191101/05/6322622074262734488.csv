首要媒体考虑新一轮裁员
01 Nov 2019, 05:33 by Ahmad Naqib Idris
（吉隆坡1日讯）媒体行业营运环境严峻，首要媒体（Media Prima Bhd）董事部正在考虑新一轮的裁员。
一名知情的业内人士透露：“各部门负责人已接到通知，将在今午3时召开会议，讨论董事部会议的结果。”
消息说：“据推测，这将涉及裁员，但我们必须等待董事部会议的结果。”
如果属实，这将是首要媒体进行的第二轮员工合理化活动。
去年11月，首要媒体旗下经营免费电视台TV3的Sistem Televisyen Malaysia Bhd向190每名职员发出3个月的裁员通知，同时向另外43名职员提供互惠离职方案（MSS）。
随着与商业大亨丹斯里赛莫达相关的Aurora Mulia私人有限公司，于今年9月收购该媒体集团的8829万股或7.9%股权后，首要媒体进行业务合理化。
Aurora于10月8日增持750万股，使持股权达到31.898%。
该投资工具还收购了Dilof私人有限公司的70%股权，后者在马来前锋报（Utusan Melayu (M) Bhd）关闭后，拥有《Utusan Malaysia》及《Kosmo!》的出版准证和档案。Dilof之后改名为Media Mulia私人有限公司。
截至6月杪2019财政年第二季，首要媒体净亏883万令吉，连续第二个季度蒙亏，归因于传统业务如出版和电视网络的贡献走低。
该集团自2016财年第三季以来，除了2016财年末季、2018财年次季和2018财年末季之外，均出现季度亏损。

01 Nov 2019, 05:33 by Ahmad Naqib Idris
KUALA LUMPUR (April 1): The media industry has a tough operating environment and the board of directors of Media Prima Bhd is considering a new round of layoffs.
An informed insider revealed: ""The heads of various departments have been notified that a meeting will be held at 3 o'clock this afternoon to discuss the results of the board meeting.""
The news said: ""It is speculated that this will involve layoffs, but we must wait for the results of the board meeting.""
If true, this will be the second round of employee rationalization activities conducted by the premier media.
In November last year, Sistem Televisyen Malaysia Bhd, the chief media operator of the free TV station TV3, issued a three-month notice of layoffs to each of the 190 employees, while providing a reciprocal resignation program (MSS) to another 43 employees.
Aurora Mulia Sdn Bhd, which is related to commercial tycoon Tan Sri Semoda, after the acquisition of 88.29 million shares or 7.9% of the media group in September this year, the primary media to rationalize the business.
Aurora increased its holdings of 7.5 million shares on October 8, bringing the shareholding to 31.898%.
The investment vehicle also acquired a 70% stake in Dilof Sdn Bhd, which has a publishing permit and file for Utusan Malaysia and Kosmo! after the closure of Utusan Melayu (M) Bhd. Dilof was later renamed Media Mulia Sdn Bhd.
As of June, the second quarter of the fiscal year of 2019, the primary media had a net loss of RM8.83 million, a second consecutive quarter of losses, due to lower contributions from traditional businesses such as publishing and television networks.
Since the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the group has suffered quarterly losses in addition to the 2016 fiscal year ending quarter, the 2018 fiscal year second quarter and the end of the 2018 financial year.
