Fosse/Verdon’s Steven Levenson will be handling screenwriting duties for the adaptation.
Miranda, who wrote the hit musical Hamilton: An American Musical, which has been running on Broadway since 2015, will direct.
Garfield will play the role of Jon. The actor has just wrapped up shooting on Mainstream and is about to begin production on The Eyes of Tammy Faye alongside Jessica Chastain. — AFP-Relaxnews
