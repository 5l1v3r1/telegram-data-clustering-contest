資深藝人李興文的兒子李堉睿，赴美留學返台後化身Youtuber「馬克斯」，去年在IG秀出「大麻照」一度引起軒然大波。李堉睿昨（10月31日）在Youtube上傳新影片，他在片中潛入關門後的IKEA，在賣場內待了一整晚，還全身脫光使用馬桶、蓮蓬頭等，恐怕涉及違法行為。
李堉睿10月28日晚間進入賣場，打烊後躲了好一陣子大概確認沒人後，踏進商場後開臉書直播，李堉睿還在影片中反駁網友「很多人都說這是假的，我跟你講我們玩真的。」

確認沒有人後李堉睿行徑更加大膽，直接走出去坐沙發和椅子、踩過展示家具的桌子，試躺每張床鋪，甚至脫光衣服拿起蓮蓬頭假裝洗澡、脫褲子坐在馬桶上，在電腦前假裝打手槍。
待到早上時李堉睿假裝是第一個客人走到1樓，碰巧遇到店員被叫住還假裝說「走錯邊了」，對方以為是客人好心告知「我們還沒開始（營業）你走這邊」，順利走出IKEA後，他竟笑得燦爛直呼「挑戰成功。」

在李堉睿經營的YouTube頻道寫著「讓你健康、快樂、幸福是我最大的責任 ""I suppose to set you guys free. You say it, I do it!」，然而此影片讓不少網友大罵丟臉，甚至痛批「無聊當有趣？不要降低台灣人的水準好嗎，你的行為會影響多少人的工作，還有臉在這邊沾沾自喜PO影片」。
