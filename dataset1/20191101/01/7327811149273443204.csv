01 Nov 2019, 01:13 by WABC



HUNTINGTON STATION, Long Island (WABC) -- Meet the newest Eyewitness News reporter!
Meteorologist Lee Goldberg told the Eyewitness News team that we needed to bolster our reporter staff for Halloween, so we called up 8-year-old Peyton Dilbert to give us the latest from Long Island.
From Huntington Station, Peyton told Channel 7 viewers that they should expect clouds and mild weather.
""It's not too cold. It's not too hot,"" he said during his live report.
He also predicted plenty of M&M's and Reese's Pieces in the trick-or-treating forecast.
This Halloween, Peyton dressed up as an Eyewitness News reporter -- with our signature Circle 7 microphone included. We found him after his dad tweeted a photo of the costume and tagged the Eyewitness News Weekend Morning team.
""My Son Loves watching you guys in the morning!!!!! He wants to be a ABC 7 reporter,"" he tweeted.



Unfortunately, Peyton won't be able to stay with us -- he needs to finish the third grade! Yet make sure to tune into Channel 7 in 2039 -- right now, he's slated to be N.J. Burkett's replacement!
