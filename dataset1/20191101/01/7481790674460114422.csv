ふるさと納税、対象除外は「国の裁量権乱用」…泉佐野市が提訴

01 Nov 2019, 01:21

　ふるさと納税制度の対象自治体から除外した総務省の決定は違法として、大阪府泉佐野市が１日、国に決定の取り消しを求め、大阪高裁に提訴した。同省の第三者機関「国地方係争処理委員会」が決定の再検討を勧告したが、同省が判断を維持したためで、勧告後、自治体が国を提訴するのは初めて。
　総務省はアマゾンギフト券などを返礼品とし、昨年度だけで約４９７億円を集めた泉佐野市をふるさと納税制度の対象から除外。市側は「５月末まで法規制は一切なかった。適法だった過去の行為で除外するのは、国の裁量権乱用だ」と主張している。

Oldness and tax payment, exemption is ""abuse of discretion in the country"" ... Izumisano City sued

01 Nov 2019, 01:21

The decision of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, which was excluded from the local governments covered by the hometown tax payment system, is illegal, and Izumisano City, Osaka Prefecture, asked the country to cancel the decision and filed an appeal with the Osaka High Court. The ministry's third party “National and Regional Disputes Committee” recommended reconsideration of the decision, but because the ministry maintained its judgment, it was the first time the local government filed a lawsuit after the recommendation.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications will return Izumisano City, which collected approximately 49.7 billion yen in the previous year alone, as a gift for Amazon gift vouchers, etc., and was excluded from the home tax payment system. The city argues that ""There were no laws or regulations until the end of May. Exclusion of the discretionary power of the country is to exclude it from past legitimate acts.""
