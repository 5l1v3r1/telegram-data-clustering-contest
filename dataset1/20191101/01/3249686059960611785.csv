Seven O'clock have wrapped up their first round of individual member teaser images for their upcoming 3rd mini album, 'White Night'!

On one side, the two Seven O'clock members can be seen sitting idly in a realistic universe, surrounded by an overall green color palette. On the other side, the two members seem to exist in a more dreamlike universe, taking on an overall purplish color tone.
