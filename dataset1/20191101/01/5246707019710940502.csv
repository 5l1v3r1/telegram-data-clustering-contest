Bloodstained Graphics And Performance Update For Switch Is Now Live
Addresses input lag, visual quality, crashes and load times
01 Nov 2019, 01:45 by Liam Doolan



The long-awaited graphics and performance update for Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is now available on the Nintendo Switch. In version 1.03 there are four major areas of improvement: input lag, visual quality, crashes and load times.
According to 505, input lag has been ""eliminated"" throughout the game, controls are more responsive – with enemies easier to fight and environments now less of a hassle to navigate. This will be further optimised in update 1.04.
The visual quality now looks ""more clear"" and should also be more detailed. Below are some examples and above is a trailer.






The stability of the game has also been improved, and a number of ""specific situations"" have been addressed, which were causing crashes – most commonly when reading books from shelves.
Last but not least, are the significantly reduced load times, ""by up to 70%"". More improvements will be added in version 1.04.
