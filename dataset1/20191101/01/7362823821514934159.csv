""It has come to my attention that things are being written and said to sensationalize a situation that is simply not sensational,"" he said. ""Any quote attributed to me is completely false and solely meant by haters to undermine our intention to continue to get along, protect and raise our daughters, and be examples of successful co-parents.
""We ask that you respect our privacy at this difficult time as we focus on what is important to us, our girls. Peace and love, Ian,"" the actor said.
