      <p>An ensemble worn by Hollywood screen siren Marilyn Monroe in one of her most famous roles has been sold at auction for 280,000 US dollars (£216,000).</p>
      <p>The star wore the black silk bandeau top, floral print floor-length skirt and over-sized straw hat in 1954 comedy There’s No Business Like Show Business.</p>
      <p>It was one of a number of items once belonging to Monroe that went under the hammer at an auction in Beverly Hills.</p>

      <p>The actress’ floor-length, red silk, long-sleeved sequined dress worn in the 1953 comedy Gentlemen Prefer Blondes fetched 250,000 US dollars (£193,000).</p>
      <p>A bright yellow, floor-length period gown worn by Monroe in the final scene of 1954 drama River Of No Return went for 175,000 US dollars (£135,000).</p>
      <p>And a black silk crepe cocktail dress, thought to be the same one she wore for a July 1958 press conference promoting the film Some Like It Hot, was sold for 100,000 US dollars (£77,000).</p>

      <p>Monroe was 36 when she died of a drugs overdose in Los Angeles in 1962. She remains one of Hollywood’s most enduring stars.</p>
      <p>Other highlights of the sale, held in Beverly Hills by Julien’s Auctions, include an Italian-style carved wood ornate corner chair used by the star in her final photo shoot in July 1962.</p>
      <p>That sold for just over 80,000 US dollars, about £61,000.</p>

      <p>And a brown and olive green striped couch used in the office of Monroe’s psychiatrist, Dr Ralph Greenson, during the time he treated her sold for 11,250 US dollars (£8,700), well over its estimate of 1,000 US dollars (£775).</p>
      <p>The collection consisted of 115 of Monroe’s items, with all sold at no reserve.</p>
      <p>While some of the winning bids were eye-catching, they fell some way short of the record for an item of Monroe’s clothing.</p>
      <p>In 2016 Julien’s Auctions sold the dress Monroe wore while singing Happy Birthday Mr President to John F Kennedy fetched 4.8 million US dollars (£3.7 million).</p>
