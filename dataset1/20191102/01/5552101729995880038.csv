【獨家】金馬影后被爆職場霸凌　強迫劇組陪她剃平頭
02 Nov 2019, 01:58 by 娛樂組
港星曾志偉兒子曾國祥導演的陸片《少年的你》終於甩開今年2月及6月先後從柏林影展及原定檔期撤片陰霾，順利在10月25日上映，截至11月1日，短短7天票房就衝破近40億台幣，且朝45億邁進。兩位主演周冬雨及易烊千璽的演出都獲得稱讚，尤其是偶像團體出身的易烊千璽，甩開身上「流量小生」賣臉賣人氣標籤，紮紮實實邁向「實力派演員」道路。
或許因為之前退出柏林影展新生代單元的放映，和排定檔期後又遭撤片，2次的風波令電影未上映就吸引相當多的關注，因此《少年的你》上片首日排片率高達40%，這個數字僅低於一些帶有宣揚國威色彩的電影，其他同期新片連它的車尾燈都看不到。
女主角周冬雨身為金馬影后，演技自不在話下，但出身自鮮肉團體TFBOYS的易烊千璽，無疑給了觀眾一大驚喜。平時被暱稱為「四字弟弟」的他，在片中飾演從小混跡街頭的「小北」，揉合了暴力、狂傲、叛逆的演出被狂讚「演技炸裂」，尤其被警察壓制時的眼神戲味十足，但當時他尚未接受專業戲劇訓練，卻能演出那樣的眼神，為他驚豔不已的觀眾甚至將#易烊千璽到底經歷了什麼#頂上了熱搜。

據悉在《少年的你》首映現場，就有一位製片人告訴易烊千璽：「你不是一個偶像，你是一個演員」，這句話當場逼哭易烊千璽。大家以往看他，只是一個「流量小鮮肉」，但今年易烊千璽先有《長安十二時辰》，後有《少年的你》，兩部都是熱門大爆夯作，且他也憑藉這兩部作品證明自己有資格成為「實力派演員」，而他現在還不滿19歲！而歌舞俱佳的易烊千璽，戲裡造型不是帶傷就是一臉髒污，不惜自毀顏值，與平日帥氣的樣子相差甚遠，但仍被讚「最醜的易烊千璽，交出最好的表演」。

《少年的你》討論校園霸凌議題，周冬雨飾演的「陳念」多次在校園遭到有錢同學的霸凌，用球砸她的臉、剪她的頭髮，周冬雨更為戲剃了個平頭，展現了她的敬業與專業。但有爆料者說，周冬雨在剃頭那天，要求劇組一些人講義氣，跟她一起剃平頭。有的人願意，但也有人不從，爆料者稱周冬雨便拿了電推，見人就去「嚕」對方的頭髮，導致劇組有好幾個人頭髮都被剃掉好幾道，像狗啃的一樣。

這個黑料被爆出來後，不少網友留言「舉著反霸凌的牌子幹職場霸凌的事，還真是一幅很好的諷刺畫呢」「假任性真霸凌」「她剃頭是為工作，而且有錢賺，強迫別人剃頭什麼鬼？拿錢的時候分別人了嗎？別人又不欠你的」「我要視工作人員我會偷偷許願不再合作小黃鴨（周冬雨外號）了」，一面倒指責她職場霸凌。
雖然也有八卦博主為周冬雨澄清並沒有硬幹亂剃別人頭髮一事，但從照片中確實見到好幾個工作人員都陪周冬雨剃了平頭，其中還不乏女生，可說相當有義氣。而周冬雨在剃了平頭之後，因為要保密，足足有半年的時間，出席活動都只能戴假髮或帽子，由於假髮不好搭配衣服，造型也不好看，還被譏嘲衣品太差，她也只能吞下這個啞巴虧。

另外《少年的你》其實改編自小說《少年的你，如此美麗》，但被控抄襲東野圭吾《白夜行》、《忍冬》、《嫌疑人X的獻身》等作品嫌疑。導演曾國祥表示自己只看過一遍原著，至於《白夜行》則沒看過。其實原著作者玖月晞早被諷「融哏天后」，特別擅長將其他經典作品的哏用各種方式融入自己的作品，《少年的你》也因為原著的抄襲風波，在影評網站「豆瓣」的分數，從8.8降到8.4分。

[Exclusive] After the Golden Horse Shadow was exploded, the workplace was forced to accompany her to shave her head.
02 Nov 2019, 01:58 by Entertainment Group
Hong Kong Star Zeng Zhiwei's son Zeng Guoxiang's landet ""You of the Youth"" finally opened in February and June this year from the Berlin Film Festival and the original scheduled period of the haze, successfully released on October 25, as of November 1, short The short-term 7-day box office broke through nearly 4 billion Taiwan dollars and moved towards 4.5 billion. The two starring performances of Zhou Dongyu and Yi Qian’s performances were praised, especially the idols and wives who were born in the idol group. They opened their ""flowing niche"" and sold their faces to sell popular labels, and they steadily marched toward the ""powerful actors"" road. .
Perhaps because of the previous screening of the new generation of the Berlin Film Festival, and the withdrawal of the film after the scheduled period, the two storms caused the film to be unreleased and attracted a lot of attention, so the ""Youth of You"" film was ranked as high as the first day. 40%, this number is only lower than some movies with the color of national prestige, other new films and even the taillights of the same period can not be seen.
After the actress Zhou Dongyu was a golden horse, her acting skills were self-sufficient, but she was born in the TFBOYS of the fresh meat group, which undoubtedly gave the audience a big surprise. He is nicknamed the ""four-character brother"". He plays the ""Little North"" who has been stalking the streets in the film. He has mixed violent, arrogant and rebellious performances and was praised as ""explosive acting"", especially when he was suppressed by the police. His eyes were full of play, but at that time he had not yet received professional drama training, but he could perform such a look, and the audience that had been amazing for him even went through the #易烊千玺.


Yi Qian’s performance in the film was outstanding, and he was madly praised as “explosive acting” and entered the ranks of “powerful actors”. (The movie boy's official blog)

It is reported that at the premiere of ""You of the Boys"", a producer told Yi Qiann: ""You are not an idol, you are an actor"", this sentence is forced to cry on the spot. Everyone used to look at him in the past, but it was just a ""small flow of fresh meat"". But this year, Yi Qianqian first had ""Chang'an Twelve Hours"" and later ""You are a teenager"". Both of them were popular hits, and he also relied on These two works prove that they are qualified to be ""powerful actors"", and he is still under 19 years old! The songs and dances are excellent, and the style is not hurt or a dirty face. It does not hesitate to ruin the value of the face. It is far from the handsome look of the weekday, but it is still praised as ""the ugliest and easy to marry."" The best performance.""


The winter rains in the film came from poor families, so they were bullied by the rich girls in the class. (The movie boy's official blog)

""You in the Youth"" discusses the topic of bullying on campus. ""Chen Nian"" played by Zhou Dongyu has been bullied by wealthy classmates on campus many times. She used her ball to lick her face and cut her hair. Zhou Dongyu even shaved her face. Pingtou shows her dedication and professionalism. However, some people who broke the news said that Zhou Dongyu asked some people in the crew to talk about loyalty and shave their heads together on the day of shaving. Some people are willing, but some people are not. The person who broke the news said that Zhou Dongyu took the electric push. When he saw someone, he went to ""snap"" the other's hair, causing several people in the crew to be shaved, like shit. .


Zhou Dongyu was throwing off the show, and several staff members of the crew had shaved her head together. (The movie boy's official blog)

After the black material was blown out, many netizens commented that ""the anti-bullying brand is doing a good job of bullying. It is really a good caricature."" ""Fake sex is really bully."" ""She shaves her head for work. And have money to earn, forcing others to shave what kind of ghosts? When people take money, are they different? Others don’t owe you."" ""I want to see the staff, I will secretly make a wish to no longer cooperate with Xiao Huangya (Zhou Dongyu nickname)"" On one side, she accused her of bullying in the workplace.
Although there are also gossip bloggers who clarified Zhou Dongyu and did not harden to shave other people's hair, but from the photos, I saw several staff members who were shaving their heads with Zhou Dongyu. There are still many girls, but they are quite loyal. After Zhou Dongyu was shaving his head, because he had to keep it secret, he had to spend half a year. He could only wear a wig or a hat when attending the event. Because the wig is not good with clothes, the shape is not good, and it is too bad. Can only swallow this dumb loss.


After the director Zeng Guoxiang followed ""July and Ansheng"", he handed over a masterpiece. (The movie boy's official blog)

In addition, ""You of the Teenagers"" is actually adapted from the novel ""You are so beautiful,"" but was accused of copying Dongye Guiwu's ""White Nights"", ""Ninja"", ""Dedication of Suspect X"" and other works suspected. Director Zeng Guoxiang said that he had only seen the original work once. As for ""White Nights"", he had not seen it. In fact, the original author, Yu Yue, was ridiculed as ""the sorrow of the sky"". He is especially good at integrating the works of other classic works into his own works in various ways. ""You of the Juvenile"" is also because of the original plagiarism, on the film review site ""Douban"". The score dropped from 8.8 to 8.4.
