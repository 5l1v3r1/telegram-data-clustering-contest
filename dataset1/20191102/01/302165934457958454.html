      <h1>Ultimate Ears’ Wonderboom 2 could be the ideal speaker for the outdoors</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 2 — The latest iteration of <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/ultimate-ears">Ultimate Ears</a>‘ popular Wonderboom Bluetooth speaker, the Wonderboom 2, is now available in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>The original Wonderboom was known for being both versatile and loud for its size, and it appears that Ultimate Ears’ latest portable speaker is continuing in that vein of form.</p>
      <p>While they look relatively similar to the original Wonderboom, the sequel comes with some marked improvements.</p>
      <p>This includes a longer battery life of 13 hours — up from 10 hours — along with a new feature called “Double Up”.</p>
      <p>Essentially, this will allow you to pair two Wonderboom 2 speakers to play tracks back in true stereo, as opposed to merely mirroring the audio.</p>
      <p>They’ve also added an outdoor listening mode called “Outdoor Boost”, which will supposedly use an EQ profile that better complements an outdoor environment.</p>

      <p>Ultimate Ears says that they’ve also adjusted the cutoff frequency so that the Wonderboom 2 has a bassier profile.</p>
      <p>The Wonderboom 2 isn’t just waterproo — rated at IP67 — but it’s also able to float, which makes it ideal for those pool parties or waterfall hangout sessions.</p>
      <p>Overall, the latest speaker from Ultimate Ears is clearly designed for outdoor use, with the Wonderboom 2 still measuring at around the same size as the older Wonderboom.</p>
      <p>It also comes with a new two-tone fabric look, and is available in 5 colours: Deep Space Black, Crushed Ice, Radical Red, Bermuda Blue, and Just Peach.</p>
      <p>The Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 2 is now available at select stores in Malaysia at a retail price of RM389.
