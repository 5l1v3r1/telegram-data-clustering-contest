        <b>Saturday 2nd November, 3pm, Seaview.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Crusaders host Institute at Seaview (today) at 3pm, as the Shore Road side hope to remain in contention at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>The last time the two sides met, Crusaders delivered a 6-0 hammering to Institute at The Brandywell Stadium, with Paul Heatley grabbing a brace and Paul McElroy scoring on his debut.</p>
      <p>Institute have not won against Crusaders in almost ten years, with their last win coming in late November 2009.</p>
      <p>Both sides booked their place in the Bet McLean League Cup semi-final this week, as Joe McCready’s goal for Institute was enough for a 1-0 win over Newry City.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it took 119 minutes for Stephen Baxter’s Crusaders to find the winner against Ballymena on Tuesday night, when Jarlath O’Rourke squeezed the ball home for Crusaders’ winning goal.</p>
      <p>One of the Irish League’s most decorated footballers, Billy Joe Burns believes that it is Crusaders’ mentality and fitness that drives them on.</p>
      <p>“Over the years it’s something we’ve done; we dig deep to get results.</p>
      <p>“Especially against Glenavon, we rescued a point, although we didn’t play well, we took something from that game when we mightn’t have deserved to."</p>

      <p>Burns is looking forward to another game on Saturday, as the Hatchet Men are in the midst of a heavy schedule.</p>
      <p>“This is the busy part of the season, we have games Tuesday, Saturday, Tuesday with training in between…</p>
      <p>“It’s a lot of football for a part time league but were used to it.” said the Crues’ right-back.</p>
      <p>Following Tuesday night’s win, Burns commented on his delight with Stephen Baxter’s summer-signings, as Jamie McGonigle’s stunning opener and Jarlath O’Rourke’s winner saw Crusaders win the quarter-final.</p>
      <p>“That’s what Stephen does, he adds to the strength we have and recruit’s talent.</p>
      <p>“With Jamie McGonigle, we knew that we were getting a quality player and a goal scorer, it naturally takes time to settle in but with that goal on Tuesday night, he showed how good he is.</p>
      <p>“Jarlath O’Rourke was another signing who’s came in and done well.</p>
      <p>“He had a great game against wolves but has been a bit unfortunate with injuries since then.</p>
      <p>“It’s great to see them both scoring!”</p>

      <p>Crusaders sit just two points off the league leaders Coleraine, with Burns adding that “consistency” is the key factor in winning titles.</p>
      <p>“I keep saying it, over and over, consistency is key.”</p>
      <p>“If you can perform week after week and get results, you will do well.”</p>
      <p>“I keep mentioning it, but it’s one of the most important factors in football.”</p>
      <p>Burns also hailed the progress that Crusaders have made under Baxter, and gave credit to the young players coming through their youth system.</p>
      <p>“When there’s players coming through and getting to the first team, if they train and play well then they will go far.”</p>
      <p>“Stuart Dallas was probably the first to push on and get a career in England, but him and Gavin Whyte have really set the standard.</p>

      <p>“They’ve set the bar high for young players and for the club to push on,</p>
      <p>“The clubs heading in the right direction, there’s no doubt about that.” added the six-time Irish League winner.</p>
