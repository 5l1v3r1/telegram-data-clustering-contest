揭秘：胡錦濤六字遊戲 江澤民中招

02 Nov 2019, 01:39

【新唐人北京時間2019年10月26日訊】胡錦濤作為中共總書記的執政10年，權力被江澤民架空，導致政令難行，習近平上台後大權獨攬，以反腐的名義，拿下江澤民的眾多親信大員，令江無比狼狽，而這一切與胡錦濤兩次「捉弄」江澤民有關。
據海外媒體報導，習近平能在中共十七大成為政治局常委，立為十八大一把手接班人，與江澤民同意胡錦濤「黨內民主投票」有直接關係。
中共十七大之前，江澤民原計劃的「接班人」、中共上海市委書記陳良宇，被胡錦濤溫家寶合力拿下；曾慶紅因為年齡問題，也被胡錦濤抓住不得在十七大連任。在此情況下，薄熙來成為江澤民唯一推動入常的「自己人」。
但薄熙來名聲太臭，在推的過程中遇到重重阻力，雙方僵持不下的情況下，胡錦濤出了個主意，採用「黨內民主投票」測試。江澤民稀里糊塗的就同意了。
可是投票測試的結果出乎江澤民意料，路透社曾援引三個不同消息來源說，習近平在2007年初一個摸底的黨內地方選舉中，獲得最高票數；在上海的一次選舉中，獲得90%的選票。更有一個消息來源稱，習近平在地方黨委首腦的支持度是全國第一。
而薄熙來卻在選舉中被打敗，在倒數之列。這樣只是一名普通中央委員的習近平，在十七大直接進常委會，而薄熙來等於被淘汰。
新當選的十七屆政治局常委中，習近平和李克強都是新來者，因為李克強與胡錦濤都是團派出生，江澤民不放心，又耍小聰明強烈建議把習近平排在前位，沒想到胡錦濤因為胡耀邦的原因，與習近平家族關係密切，同意了習近平排名第六，李克強排名第七。
這樣一來，習近平一步一步接近中共最高領導人的大位，最後終於在胡錦濤「裸退」奇招之下，成為江澤民的「掘墓人」。

江澤民出面與胡錦濤達成6字「共識」

中共軍中總後勤部基建營房部副部長谷俊山，2012年因涉貪被查，成為中共軍委副主席徐才厚和郭伯雄案的突破口。
海外中文媒體披露，谷俊山案發後，郭伯雄和徐才厚曾求助江澤民，江澤民出面與胡錦濤達成6字「共識」保護二人。可是，江澤民沒想到，胡錦濤又與習近平達成另外6字「約定」，巧妙的打破江澤民的包庇屏障。
谷俊山被胡錦濤拍板調查後，徐、郭二人一度有些驚慌，曾求教於江澤民。當時正逢中共十八大前後，江安撫徐、郭，稱已和胡達成共識「止於谷，不上追」。
但江沒有料到，胡錦濤有另外一招，既不食言，也不吃癟，與習近平也達成了共識，習近平與胡錦濤進行分工，「你查谷、我查上」。這樣一來，查谷俊山是胡拍板決定的，而查徐才厚則是習近平的主意。
2014年3月31日，谷俊山被提起公訴；同年3月15日，徐才厚被調查，2015年3月患癌死亡；郭伯雄於2015年落馬，2016年7月被判終身監禁。至此江澤民軍中三「最愛」全落馬。
港媒披露，郭伯雄落馬後，在監獄服刑期間，不但自曝接受徐才厚轉交賄款的詳情，還咬出江澤民，把軍隊變質問題歸咎於江澤民對軍隊的領導。
徐才厚和郭伯雄兩人不但替江澤民把持軍權10多年，架空了胡錦濤，兩人還曾阻擊習近平進軍委。在一個有數人在場的軍方半公開場合，徐才厚曾對郭伯雄說：「讓他（指習近平）干5年就滾蛋！」
而徐才厚統管總後勤部和總政治部期間，各地軍隊醫院發生大量活摘法輪功學員器官的行為，這種駭人聽聞的活摘器官黑幕，至今仍被中共掩蓋。

Secret: Hu Jintao six-character game Jiang Zemin Zhongzhao

02 Nov 2019, 01:39

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, October 26, 2019] Hu Jintao, as the CCP’s general secretary for 10 years, was overthrown by Jiang Zemin, which led to the imperial decree. After Xi Jinping took office, he took power and monopolized it. In the name of anti-corruption, he won many of Jiang Zemin’s cronies. Members, Jiang is incomparable, and all this is related to Hu Jintao’s ""catching"" Jiang Zemin twice.
According to overseas media reports, Xi Jinping became a member of the Politburo Standing Committee at the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and became the first-in-command of the 18th National Congress. It has a direct relationship with Jiang Zemin's agreement with Hu Jintao's ""democratic vote within the party.""
Before the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Jiang Zemin’s planned ""successor"" and Chen Liangyu, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, were jointly won by Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao; Zeng Qinghong was also arrested by Hu Jintao for his appointment in the 17th Dalian because of his age. Under this circumstance, Bo Xilai became the only ""self"" who Jiang Zemin promoted.
However, Bo Xilai’s reputation was too stinking. In the process of pushing and encountering heavy resistance, Hu Jintao made an idea and adopted the test of “democratic voting within the party”. Jiang Zemin agreed to it.
However, the results of the voting test were unexpected to Jiang Zemin. Reuters quoted three different sources as saying that Xi Jinping won the highest number of votes in a local party election in early 2007; in an election in Shanghai, he obtained 90%. vote. There is also a source that Xi Jinping’s support for the heads of local party committees is the highest in the country.
Bo Xilai was defeated in the election and was in the countdown. This is just an ordinary Central Committee member Xi Jinping, who went directly to the Standing Committee at the 17th National Congress, and Bo Xilai was eliminated.
Among the newly elected members of the 17th Politburo, Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang are newcomers. Because Li Keqiang and Hu Jintao are both born, Jiang Zemin is not at ease, and he is clever and strongly recommends that Xi Jinping be in the top position. He did not expect Hu Jintao because The reason for Hu Yaobang is closely related to the Xi Jinping family. He agreed that Xi Jinping ranked sixth and Li Keqiang ranked seventh.
In this way, Xi Jinping stepped closer to the top position of the top leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, and finally became Jiang Zemin's ""digger"" under Hu Jintao's ""naked retreat"".

Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao reached a 6-word ""consensus""

Gu Junshan, deputy director of the Infrastructure and Sports Department of the General Logistics Department of the Chinese Communist Party, was investigated for corruption in 2012 and became the breakthrough point of Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong, vice-chairmen of the CPC Central Military Commission.
Overseas Chinese media revealed that after the case of Gu Junshan, Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou had sought help from Jiang Zemin, and Jiang Zemin came forward with Hu Jintao to reach a six-word ""consensus"" to protect the two. However, Jiang Zemin did not expect that Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping reached another 6-character ""contract"" to subtly break Jiang Zemin's shelter barrier.
After Gu Junshan was attacked by Hu Jintao, Xu and Guo were somewhat alarmed and asked for Jiang Zemin. At that time, before and after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Jiang Anfu Xu and Guo said that they had reached a consensus with Hu that they would stop at the valley and not pursue it.
However, Jiang did not expect that Hu Jintao had another move, neither reneging on words nor eating crickets. He also reached a consensus with Xi Jinping. Xi Jinping and Hu Jintao had a division of labor. ""You check the valley, I check it."" In this way, Cha Gu Junshan was decided by Hu Paiban, and Cha Xu Caihou was Xi Jinping's idea.
On March 31, 2014, Gu Junshan was prosecuted; on March 15, the same year, Xu Caihou was investigated and died of cancer in March 2015; Guo Boxiong was dismissed in 2015 and was sentenced to life imprisonment in July 2016. So far, Jiang Zemin’s three ""favorites"" have all fallen.
The Hong Kong media disclosed that after Guo Boxiong was dismissed from prison, during his prison sentence, he not only exposed the details of Xu Caihou’s transfer of bribes, but also bite out Jiang Zemin and blamed Jiang Zemin’s leadership over the army.
Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong not only took Jiang Zemin’s military power for more than 10 years, but also hurried Hu Jintao. The two also blocked Xi Jinping’s entry into the military commission. In a semi-public situation where a few people were present, Xu Caihou once said to Guo Boxiong: ""Let him (referring to Xi Jinping) go out after five years!""
While Xu Caihou was in charge of the General Logistics Department and the General Political Department, a large number of live organ harvesting organs of Falun Gong practitioners occurred in various military hospitals. This horrific live organ harvesting obscuration has still been concealed by the CCP.
