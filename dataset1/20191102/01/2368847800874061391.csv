香港淪為警察國家 美議員推「如水法案」加碼制裁

02 Nov 2019, 01:47

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】香港局勢惡化被指已淪為「警察國家」，三名美國參議員日前提出《香港如水法案》（Hong Kong Be Water Act），要求「加碼」處理制裁壓迫港人言論、集會、遊行等基本權利的中港官員以及與其合作的人員。
10月31日，美國共和黨三名參議員霍利（Josh Hawley）、斯科特（Rick Scott）和科寧（John Cornyn））提出《香港如水法案》（Hong Kong Be Water Act），譴責中共違背《中英聯合聲明》和香港《基本法》所規定的有關義務。
自由亞洲報導，三名參議員要求行政部門，根據美國《全球馬格尼茨基人權法》（Global Magnitsky Act），制裁壓迫港人言論、結社、集會、遊行和示威自由的香港和中共政府官員，對那些代表這些官員或與之合作的人，也要施加同等制裁。
法案還提出，授權行政部門（動用《國際緊急經濟權力法》）凍結參與壓迫港人上述權利的中國公民和國有企業的財產，禁止其進入美國。
法案主要提案人霍利和斯科特早前親自到香港觀察示威情況，兩人都指香港已淪為「警察國家」，情況非常危急。
斯科特在聲明中說，他在10月初訪港期間，曾與抗爭者交談，聽到有關香港警察採取暴力、威脅和恐嚇的可怕事件。「作為美國人，我們不能讓這種情況繼續下去。我們必須與抵抗中共、爭取人權的勇敢港人站在一起。」
霍利表示：「毋庸置疑，香港正在迅速成為一個警察國家。我們必須向世界發出一個信號：當香港人起身抵抗中國共產黨的時候，美國會與他們站在一起。」
霍利解釋說，法案取名「如水」（Be Water），是來自香港抗爭者的策略。有抗爭者對他說，「當遇到警察的時候，要像水一樣，這是很重要的。也就是說，行動要快、要流暢。」
有分析指，《香港如水法案》是繼《香港人權與民主法案》後，美國國會議員要求「加碼」處理香港日益惡化的情勢。
香港反送中抗爭爆發後，港府採取暴力鎮壓手段，遭到國際社會譴責。美國參眾兩院6月分別提出《香港人權與民主法案》。
《香港人權與民主法案》要求美國國務卿每年向國會提交報告，評估香港是否繼續享受不同於中國大陸的特殊待遇。法案要求總統制定制裁名單，拒絕侵蝕香港自治和法治的人入境、凍結其在美資產等。
目前，該法案已在眾議院一致通過，正等待參議院排期審議。通過之後，兩院版本合併，將交由總統簽署生效。

Equal sanctions are imposed on those who represent or cooperate with these officials.

The bill requires the president to set a list of sanctions, refuse to erode Hong Kong's autonomy and the rule of law, and freeze its assets in the United States.
Currently, the bill has been unanimously passed in the House of Representatives and is awaiting consideration by the Senate. After the adoption, the two houses will be merged and will be signed into effect by the President.
