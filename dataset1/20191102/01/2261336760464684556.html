      <p>UFC 244 is almost here, and as usual, Embedded is here as well. The show that gives you an inside look at the marquee contestants on PPVs has issued the fourth episode for this weekend’s big show in the The Big Apple, and it serves as a brief introduction to the fighters at the top of the card.</p>
      <p>We start things off with Stephen Thompson, who gets in a workout after his flight. He discusses his dad being in his corner since the start of his combat sports career, and what opponent Vicente Luque might bring to the table.</p>
      <p>Kelvin Gastelum is training with his manager at Renzo Gracie’s. He prefers to train late since he’ll be fighting late.</p>
      <p>Open workouts time, Things start off with Jorge Masvidal, who gets a big cheer. He cracks a couple of jokes about Ben Askren, and discusses opponent Nate Diaz. He also said having respect for Diaz doesn’t change how he feels about the fight.</p>
      <p>Nate is in a coffee shop with Kron Gracie. Gracie talks about them looking out for each other. Diaz goes out for his workout and the east coast loves him. He’s sick of talking to everybody though. That’s funny.</p>
      <p>Finally Gastelum is up. Someone in the crowd asks if he’ll get a title shot if he beats Darren Till. He lets the rest of the crowd answer that in the affirmative.</p>
      <p>And that’s it! UFC 244 goes down tomorrow night in MSG.</p>
