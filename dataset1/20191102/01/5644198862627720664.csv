Musk's Twitter account was not deactivated as of 1730 GMT.
""Reddit still seems good,"" he said.
The eccentric billionaire has a history of being playful with his Twitter account, one of corporate America's most-watched.
In June, he said he deleted his Twitter account, while also changing his Twitter display name to ""Daddy DotCom"".
Musk has previously been accused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for disclosing misleading corporate information about Tesla on Twitter.
