Here’s Your Lowdown On Apple TV+, The Latest Streaming Service To Hit The Market
02 Nov 2019, 01:27 by Joseph Earp
Apple TV+ is here!
Yep, Apple has waded into the streaming game with its very own platform, one stuffed with legacy titles and brand new programming.
Of course, by this stage, it’s totally understandable to be feeling a little worn out by the sheer number of streaming platforms going around. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Stan all offer high quality content dropping at an unbelievably fast rate — even if you picked a platform, sat down tomorrow, and decided to watch every last thing on it, you’d be overwhelmed in a matter of days. We definitely have enough stuff to stream. So what, exactly, makes Apple TV+ different?
Well, let’s take a look. Here’s our rundown of Apple TV+: how much it costs, how it works, and what new shows that it offers.
How Much Does Apple TV+ Cost?
Apple TV+ is retailing for $7.99 a month in Australia. As Finder notes, if you buy an Apple device, you’ll get a year’s subscription to the platform for free. And even if you don’t, as part of their launch deal, the service is offering a week for free. That gives you a pretty good incentive to sign up for a week, and see if the streaming service is right for you.
Can I Share Apple TV+ Across Different Devices?
If you’re used to having a family subscription to Netflix, then don’t worry: Apple’s streaming service offers much the same kind of deal. Apple TV+ can be streamed across up to six devices simultaneously. You can also have up to six users per family subscription.
What Are The New Titles Coming To The Service?
Apple TV+’s biggest drawcard is See. Starring Jason Momoa of Game of Thrones, the show boasts one helluva array of talent behind the camera. It was written by Steven Knight, probably best known for his work on the David Cronenberg film Eastern Promises, and directed by Francis Lawrence, the man who helmed three Hunger Games films.
Apple have gone all out for See. Set in a post-apocalyptic future where a mysterious illness has ravaged the sight of most human beings, the show boasts incredible production value. Imagine the exact midpoint between Game of Thrones, Mad Max, at the Jose Saramago novel Blindness and you’ll have something of a sense of what the show is like.



The other two major launch titles for the new service are Dickinson, a bizarre dramedy centred on the life of poet Emily Dickinson, and The Morning Show. The former series has been getting extremely good reviews — it follows Dickinson as she navigates life as a young woman in the distinctly stuffy 19th-century America.
The Morning Show, by contrast, has been getting somewhat more muted critical notices — but if there’s one thing that the critics all agree on, it’s that it is a lot of fun. Starring Jennifer Aniston, Steve Carell and Reese Witherspoon, it details the goings-on at a glossy, high-profile morning show. It’s kind of like the work of Aaron Sorkin run through a distinctly 2019 filter — early episodes tackle the legacy of #metoo.



The service will also offer The Elephant Queen, a non-fiction look at the natural world, and For All Mankind, a high-energy sitcom about the space program.
Basically, there’ll be a fair bit to explore on launch.
