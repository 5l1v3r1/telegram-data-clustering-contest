      <h1>After Jho Low gives up US$1b, Dr M insists fugitive financier took more</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 2 — Malaysia will pursue Low Taek Jho over more than the US$1 billion (RM4.15 billion) he forfeited to the US Justice Department (DoJ) this week, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said.</p>
      <p>The prime minister told the <i>Financial Times</i> (FT) in an interview that Malaysian authorities were convinced the sum Low or Jho Low surrendered in the US kleptocracy action was not all that was misappropriated from 1MDB.</p>
      <p>“The amount [Mr Low embezzled from 1MDB] is much bigger. If he had the full amount we would be very happy.</p>
      <p>“We are still going after the rest of the money,” Dr Mahathir was quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>The Malaysian PM also told the FT that the US has indicated that Malaysia could reclaim the sum Low forfeited if it could provide proof of ownership.</p>
      <p>The US previously gave Malaysia hundreds of millions it recovered from other kleptocracy action related to 1MDB, including US$57 million surrendered by Red Granite Pictures that is linked to former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s stepson, Riza Shahriz Abdul Aziz.</p>
      <p>The DoJ said the settlement this week represented the largest ever recovery executed under its Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative and the biggest civil forfeiture ever concluded in the US.</p>
      <p>The law enforcement agencies involved in the case also jointly issued a condemnatory statement about Low, saying the settlement denied him and his family of “ill-gotten gains” and showed the US would not be a “safe haven” for corruption.</p>
      <p>The statement also noted that Low still faced criminal charges related to the scandal in two other US districts.</p>
