      <h1>Here’s Your Lowdown On Apple TV+, The Latest Streaming Service To Hit The Market</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T01:27:36+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 01:27</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>Apple TV+ is here!</p>
      <p>Yep, Apple has waded into the streaming game with its very own platform, one stuffed with legacy titles and brand new programming.</p>
      <p>Of course, by this stage, it’s totally understandable to be feeling a little worn out by the sheer number of streaming platforms going around. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Stan all offer high quality content dropping at an unbelievably fast rate — even if you picked a platform, sat down tomorrow, and decided to watch every last thing on it, you’d be overwhelmed in a matter of days. We definitely have enough stuff to stream. So what, exactly, makes Apple TV+ different?</p>
      <p>Well, let’s take a look. Here’s our rundown of Apple TV+: how much it costs, how it works, and what new shows that it offers.</p>
      <h3>How Much Does Apple TV+ Cost?</h3>
      <p>Apple TV+ is retailing for $7.99 a month in Australia. <a href="https://www.finder.com.au/internet-tv/apple-tv-plus">As <i>Finder</i> notes</a>, if you buy an Apple device, you’ll get a year’s subscription to the platform for free. And even if you don’t, as part of their launch deal, the service is offering a week for free. That gives you a pretty good incentive to sign up for a week, and see if the streaming service is right for you.</p>
      <h3>Can I Share Apple TV+ Across Different Devices?</h3>
      <p>If you’re used to having a family subscription to Netflix, then don’t worry: Apple’s streaming service offers much the same kind of deal. Apple TV+ can be streamed across up to six devices simultaneously. You can also have up to six users per family subscription.</p>
      <h3>What Are The New Titles Coming To The Service?</h3>
      <p>Apple TV+’s biggest drawcard is <i>See</i>. Starring Jason Momoa of <i>Game of Thrones</i>, the show boasts one helluva array of talent behind the camera. It was written by Steven Knight, probably best known for his work on the David Cronenberg film <i>Eastern Promises</i>, and directed by Francis Lawrence, the man who helmed three <i>Hunger Games</i> films.</p>
      <p>Apple have gone all out for <i>See</i>. Set in a post-apocalyptic future where a mysterious illness has ravaged the sight of most human beings, the show boasts incredible production value. Imagine the exact midpoint between <i>Game of Thrones</i>, <i>Mad Max</i>, at the Jose Saramago novel <i>Blindness</i> and you’ll have something of a sense of what the show is like.</p>

      <p>The other two major launch titles for the new service are <a href="https://junkee.com/dickinson-trailer/222665"><i>Dickinson</i></a>, a bizarre dramedy centred on the life of poet Emily Dickinson, and <i>The Morning Show. </i>The former series has been getting <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/10/31/20938996/apple-tv-plus-review-the-morning-show-see-dickinson-for-all-mankind-the-elephant-queen">extremely good reviews</a> — it follows Dickinson as she navigates life as a young woman in the distinctly stuffy 19th-century America.</p>
      <p><i>The Morning Show</i>, by contrast, has been getting somewhat more muted critical notices — but if there’s one thing that the critics all agree on, it’s that it is a lot of fun. Starring Jennifer Aniston, Steve Carell and Reese Witherspoon, it details the goings-on at a glossy, high-profile morning show. It’s kind of like the work of Aaron Sorkin run through a distinctly 2019 filter — early episodes tackle the legacy of #metoo.</p>

      <p>The service will also offer <i>The Elephant Queen</i>, a non-fiction look at the natural world, and <i>For All Mankind</i>, a high-energy sitcom about the space program.</p>
      <p>Basically, there’ll be a fair bit to explore on launch.</p>
