港人準備長期抗爭 示威者學「自衛術」 1:50和理非隱形陣營強大 建制派大人物也「加盟」 4:09從「反送中標語「到」網開一面「 李嘉誠是和理非？ 7:00
大家好，歡迎收看《新聞拍案驚奇》，我是大宇。
在昨天的節目中，我們解讀了四中全會《公報》中關於港澳的部分，提到了中共當局可能收緊對港政策，特別是《公報》中提到「維護國家安全的法律制度」等字樣，引發了人們擔憂，有評論者認為當局可能是醞釀重新啟動23條立法，也有分析人士驚呼，難道香港要出現類似國安局這樣的機構嗎？但同時，香港人，無論是和理非還是勇武派，都沒有要退場的意思，一直在做長期抗爭的準備。而香港作家顏純鉤11月1號發文，稱近日站出來公開批評林鄭月娥政府的，代表李嘉誠等大地產商利益的建制派議員石禮謙，儼然變成一個「和理非」，他的表態極大撼動建制派陣營。而通過這件事看，並不在街頭的香港和理非陣營，陣容不小。當前形勢下，似乎可以說，香港的前景，轉機與憂慮同在。

Hello everyone, welcome to the ""News Surprise"", I am Daewoo.
In yesterday’s program, we read the section on Hong Kong and Macao in the ""Gazette"" of the Fourth Plenary Session, and mentioned that the Chinese authorities may tighten the policy toward Hong Kong, especially the words ""the legal system for safeguarding national security"" mentioned in the ""Gazette"". This has caused concern. Some commentators believe that the authorities may be planning to restart 23 pieces of legislation. Some analysts exclaimed. Is it necessary for Hong Kong to have an institution like the National Security Bureau? At the same time, however, Hong Kong people, whether they are both rational and brave, have no intention of leaving the market and have been preparing for long-term struggle. On the 1st of November, Hong Kong writer Yan Chunhook issued a document saying that Shi Liqian, a member of the founding party who represented the interests of Li Ka-shing and other big real estate developers, has recently become a ""harmony"". His position is greatly shaken. The establishment of the faction camp. Through this incident, it is not on the streets of Hong Kong and the Rifle camp, the lineup is not small. Under the current situation, it seems that the prospects of Hong Kong are turning around with anxiety.
