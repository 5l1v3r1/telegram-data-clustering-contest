Ultimate Ears’ Wonderboom 2 could be the ideal speaker for the outdoors
02 Nov 2019, 01:47 by BY NIC KER
KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 2 — The latest iteration of Ultimate Ears‘ popular Wonderboom Bluetooth speaker, the Wonderboom 2, is now available in Malaysia.
The original Wonderboom was known for being both versatile and loud for its size, and it appears that Ultimate Ears’ latest portable speaker is continuing in that vein of form.
While they look relatively similar to the original Wonderboom, the sequel comes with some marked improvements.
This includes a longer battery life of 13 hours — up from 10 hours — along with a new feature called “Double Up”.
Essentially, this will allow you to pair two Wonderboom 2 speakers to play tracks back in true stereo, as opposed to merely mirroring the audio.
They’ve also added an outdoor listening mode called “Outdoor Boost”, which will supposedly use an EQ profile that better complements an outdoor environment.

Ultimate Ears says that they’ve also adjusted the cutoff frequency so that the Wonderboom 2 has a bassier profile.
The Wonderboom 2 isn’t just waterproo — rated at IP67 — but it’s also able to float, which makes it ideal for those pool parties or waterfall hangout sessions.
Overall, the latest speaker from Ultimate Ears is clearly designed for outdoor use, with the Wonderboom 2 still measuring at around the same size as the older Wonderboom.
It also comes with a new two-tone fabric look, and is available in 5 colours: Deep Space Black, Crushed Ice, Radical Red, Bermuda Blue, and Just Peach.
The Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 2 is now available at select stores in Malaysia at a retail price of RM389. For more information, head over to Ultimate Ears’ website or Facebook page. — SoyaCincau

Danske Bank profits lift to £71.1m - but boss warns of 'subdued trading'
02 Nov 2019, 01:00 by Gary McDonald Business Editor



THE north's biggest bank increased its profits again in the first nine months of this year - despite its chief executive admitting demand for new borrowing ""continues to be subdued"".
Danske Bank, which employs 1,500 staff at 40 branches and business centres across Northern Ireland, saw pre-tax profits over the period lift by 6 per cent to £71.1 million.
It came on total incomes of £175.5 million, and was helped by the bank reducing its expenses to £103 million and with loans impairments down to £1.4m over the nine months compared to £3.1m in the corresponding period in 2018.
Lending was 3 per cent higher year-on-year at £5.547 billion, with retail customer activity levels remaining satisfactory.
Danske said new lending to businesses was impacted by Brexit, with some larger customers delaying investment decisions.
Customer deposits grew by 5 per cent year-on-year from £6.99 billion to £7.37 billion.
Chief executive Kevin Kingston said: “I'm pleased to report an operating profit before impairments of £72.5 million for the first nine months, and the underlying performance of the bank remains satisfactory, with lending up 3 per cent year-on-year.
“In personal banking, we continue to provide attractive mortgage packages with very competitive rates and market leading cashback offers.
“As part of our autumn mortgage campaign we announced further reductions in fixed rate mortgage products, which has led to an increase in approvals, especially in the re-mortgage switcher market.
“Indeed Danske Bank currently provides over one in four of all mortgages across Northern Ireland and our total mortgage lending is at its highest ever level.”
He added: “In business banking, demand for lending continues to be subdued as a result of uncertainty around the stretched Brexit process.
“It is important to note that our capacity to support new business lending remains strong, but current demand levels are below what we would expect in a more normalised trading environment.
“There has been a notable uplift in customer requests for support, advice and guidance from our Business Banking relationship managers – these are conversations we encourage and value.
“In the short-term, the business community awaits much-needed clarity on what the Brexit journey will look like. But the reality is, whatever shape it takes, it will only be the beginning of a new operating environment, and the process of change will be a significant factor in everybody’s lives for many years to come.”
Danske's Copenhagen-based parent company made a net profit of $450m in the third quarter, although operating expenses rose by 2 per cent due to higher compliance costs and anti-money laundering activities, mainly as a result of activities at its Estonian operation.
