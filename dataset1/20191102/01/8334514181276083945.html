      <p>DETROIT (Reuters) - United Auto Workers leaders from Ford Motor Co’s U.S. plants on Friday recommended approval of a tentative labor agreement that would allow the No. 2 U.S. automaker to avoid a strike like the one that cost its larger rival General Motors Co about $3 billion.</p>

      <p>The union turned to Ford to negotiate a new four-year agreement after ratifying a contract last week with GM following a 40-day U.S. strike that shut down almost all of that company’s North American operations. Ford and the UAW quickly reached a tentative deal on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“This contract continues a strong pattern that gives all workers a path to traditional wages and maintains the job security and benefits our members deserve,” UAW President Gary Jones said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Ford confirmed the deal in a statement and declined further comment.</p>
      <p>The deal now must be ratified by the 55,000 UAW workers at Ford, with voting running through Nov. 15. While GM’s deal was approved, ratification is not a sure thing, as union members at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV in 2015 rejected the first version of a contract.</p>
      <p>Detailed terms of the Ford deal echoed those agreed to with GM, as the union typically uses the first deal as a pattern for those that follow. The UAW said the deal included agreements by Ford to invest more than $6 billion in its U.S. plants, and to create or retain more than 8,500 UAW jobs.</p>
      <p>The spending includes a $1.1 billion investment in Ford’s Wayne, Michigan, pickup truck plant; $1 billion for the Louisville, Kentucky, plant, where Ford makes pickups and SUVs; and $900 million in an Ohio plant where it produces heavy-duty pickup trucks. A new unnamed vehicle will be added to the Ohio plant in 2023.</p>
      <p>The deal also includes building hybrid and fully electric versions of various SUV models and the best-selling F-150 pickup truck, the union said.</p>
      <p>Full-time UAW members at Ford will receive a signing bonus of $9,000, but the deal will allow the Dearborn, Michigan, company to close an engine plant in Romeo, Michigan.</p>
      <p>The deal includes pay raises and lump-sum payments over the life of the contract, a pathway to full-time employment for temporary employees and unchanged healthcare coverage.</p>
      <p>Once the Ford deal is ratified, the UAW will turn to Fiat Chrysler to complete its quadrennial talks with the Detroit automakers.</p>
      <p>The talks have at times been overshadowed by an ongoing federal corruption probe that has involved several UAW senior leaders and been linked to Jones. A UAW spokesman on Friday declined to address the probe.</p>
