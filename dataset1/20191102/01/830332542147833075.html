      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers says it's "astonishing" that Republicans want to fire his agriculture secretary.</p>
      <p>Ever appointed Brad Pfaff to lead the agency in January, but the Senate has not voted to confirm him. Pfaff angered lawmakers when he criticized the Legislature's Republican-controlled budget committee for not releasing $200,000 to help with farmer mental health programs.</p>
      <p>Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald's spokesman Alec Zimmerman says there aren't enough votes in the Senate to confirm him. He says Fitzgerald asked Evers to withdraw the nomination.</p>
      <p>Evers didn't say in a statement whether he would do that. Instead, he says removing Pfaff would "create even more uncertainty and instability" for farmers and rural communities.</p>
      <p>The Senate is scheduled to vote on Pfaff on Tuesday.</p>
