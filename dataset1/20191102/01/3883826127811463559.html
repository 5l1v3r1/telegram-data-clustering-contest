        <b>The government has published new league tables showing which regions of the UK have the most charging points for drivers of electric vehicles.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The most per 100,000 people are in London, followed by Scotland, while Yorkshire is the worst by that measure.</p>
      <p>Outside London, Orkney and Milton Keynes have the most. But Barrow-in-Furness and Scilly each have none.</p>
      <p>The government is offering local authorities £5m in funding for new charging points.</p>

      <p>The government wants the UK to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p>
      <p>Scottish Power estimates that in order to achieve this, the UK needs to have 25 million charging points for electric vehicles - the equivalent of installing 4,000 a day - and 23 million electric heat pumps to replace domestic gas boilers.</p>
      <p>And all at a cost of nearly £300bn.</p>
      <p>Scottish Power's chief executive, Keith Anderson, told the BBC's Today programme last month that people needed to see there was a network in place in order for them to change, for example, to cleaner modes of transport.</p>

      <p>Last month, the government announced that drivers of electric cars across the UK could soon be using special green number plates under new plans.</p>
      <p>The aim is to make it possible for local authorities to allow zero-emission vehicles to benefit from incentives such as cheaper parking.</p>
      <p>The government hopes it will boost electric car sales, helping it achieve its 2050 target of net zero emissions.</p>
      <p>But Friends of the Earth said that without better financial incentives and more charging points, little would change.</p>

      <p>Despite being on the rise, all-electric vehicles still represent only a fraction of total car sales and there are challenges to uptake, including a lack of charging points on roads and too few low-cost models.</p>
      <p>The government said a similar licence plate scheme, introduced on a trial basis in the Canadian province of Ontario, had led to an increase in electric vehicle registrations.</p>
      <p>Critics say it could foster resentment and a scrappage scheme for fuel-burning cars would be better.</p>

      <p>While the cars can be expensive compared to petrol ones, they are also challenging to make commercially from scratch.</p>
      <p>In October, Dyson, the technology company best known for its vacuum cleaners, scrapped a project to build electric cars.</p>
      <p>The firm, headed by British inventor Sir James Dyson, said its engineers had developed a "fantastic electric car", but that it would not hit the roads because it was not "commercially viable".</p>
      <p>In an email sent to all employees, Sir James said the company had unsuccessfully tried to find a buyer for the project. The division employed 500 UK workers.</p>
