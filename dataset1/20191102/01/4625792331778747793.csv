Sean Hannity: 'Deep state' will get 'rocked' at the 'perfect' time for Trump
02 Nov 2019, 01:13 by Daniel Chaitin
Fox News host Sean Hannity said the ""deep state"" will face a reckoning at the ""perfect"" time for President Trump.
Hannity, a fierce Trump defender, argued on Thursday the House impeachment process will blow up in Democrats' faces in the 2020 election, all while the president receives a boost from two high-profile investigations from the Justice Department.
""The world of the deep state is about to be rocked by the FISA report from the inspector general, the Durham report is now a criminal investigation, I know a lot of what is coming there, too, it will shock the conscience of the American people — all they have done to destroy Donald Trump,"" Hannity said.
""The timing is probably now going to be perfect,"" he added.
This was just the latest instance of Hannity devoting his top-rated Fox News show to discussing the ""deep state,"" or sinister forces within the federal government bureaucracy working against the president.
On an almost nightly basis, Hannity has cited his ""sources"" to raise expectations for the coming release of DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report on possible Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses and U.S. Attorney John Durham opening a criminal inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation. As Hannity would tell it, they will uncover alleged wrongdoing by top law enforcement and intelligence officials in an effort to take down Trump.
In recent days, Hannity claimed his ""sources"" have told him witnesses who have testified in closed-door depositions have debunked ""every single lie"" told by Democrats from their ""secret Soviet Union-style impeachment coup attempt.""



In speaking with guest Lara Trump, who is a campaign adviser to Trump and is the wife of his son Eric Trump, Hannity made the case that the momentum from the impeachment push favors the president, even after the Democrats got a resolution passed to formalize the process and the headlines emerging from the depositions paint a dark picture for the administration.
""You are in charge of Trump 2020 — to me they are giving you the biggest campaign donation possible. Because the American people see this for what it is. This has been three years of doing nothing for the American people and obsessing over this,"" he said.
Trump agreed it is a ""gift"" for the campaign, noting that internal polling shows Trump’s support has ""gone up thanks to the impeachment inquiry"" since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi first announced it last month.
