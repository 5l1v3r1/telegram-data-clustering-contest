Ізраїль перехопив сім ракет із сектора Газа

02 Nov 2019, 01:46


Армія оборони Ізраїлю 1 листопада опублікувала відео, на якому зняте перехоплення семи ракет, випущених з палестинського сектора Газа.

Відповідно до публікації в Twitter, ракети були спрямовані на прикордонні ізраїльські населені пункти, а потім перехоплені Ізраїлем за допомогою системи ППО «Залізний купол».
Раніше, 31 жовтня, пресслужба армії єврейської держави вже повідомляла про одну ракету, випущену з сектора Газа по території Ізраїлю.
Відносини між Ізраїлем і Палестиною загострилися в травні 2018 року на тлі перенесення посольства США з Тель-Авіва до Єрусалиму, який є спірною територією. Ізраїльська сторона вважає місто своєї неподільною столицею, а Палестина претендує на його східну частину.
10 вересня прем'єр-міністра Ізраїлю Біньяміна Нетаньяху евакуювали з передвиборної зустрічі в місті Ашдоді після спрацьовування сирен повітряної тривоги. Причиною стали п'ять ракет, випущених з сектора Газа по Ашкелону і Ашдоду.
