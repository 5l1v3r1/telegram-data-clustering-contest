Снимки на улични котки взривиха мрежата. На кадрите се вижда как животинките са се сгушили една в друга и позират сякаш нарочно за снимката.Десетте котки са с различна цветова окраска и изглеждат като нарисувани. 



Снимките бяха публикувани в една от фейсбук групите и веднага предизвикаха десетки коментари. Някои от потребителите дори се интересуват къде са котките, защото искат да ги спасят.

For the third time in two weeks, Hizballah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah looks at the popular movement in Lebanon. He reaffirmed the positives of the protests, but recalled that the embassies had a relationship with some of the movement, and asked for the formation of a government that responds to the demands of the Lebanese. The history of Lebanon, this was not spontaneous, but directed, and some who pushed in the direction of cursing were luring the other street, and we all know that everyone in Lebanon has weapons, but only qualitative weapons at the resistance, and was required to rally the street. He criticized ""blocking roads, erecting barriers, humiliating citizens, taking sisters and being exposed to media, especially correspondence,"" considering that one million and two million people on the street are unscientific. Millions were at their homes and roads were cut off, and many were insulted, especially on the south road where there was deliberate To cut it. "" He reiterated that ""those who rode the wave of movement and raised the political bishop, were required to carry out a political coup. All this created a state of tension and anger in many streets."" As for the resignation of the government, he said: ""When we said we do not support the resignation of this government, not because it is the government of Hezbollah. I stress that over the past years and days we have not been concerned about the resistance and ourselves because we are very, very strong, and there was no time when we were so strong in all fields. We are not afraid, and I told some that if the country goes into chaos, the state may not be able to pay the salaries of the employees, but the resistance will still be able to pay salaries. "" Nasrallah explained that ""our view is that the government meets and offers people laws to combat corruption and the recovery of looted funds and the amnesty law and send them to the House of Representatives. We did not stick to the government, but proceeded our position in the interest of the country and our fear of going to a long period of caretaker business,"" He pointed out that ""Prime Minister Saad Hariri took the option of resigning means that there are some repercussions, including that the reform paper has stalled, and no amnesty bill, and anti-corruption bills, all of which went to wait, and economic treatment went to wait as well."" He pointed out that ""parliamentary consultations will take place in the coming days and there will be a mandate, and the Lebanese should cooperate to form, and if the caretaker period is prolonged, it means that no government is dealing with the economic situation, and the demands of the people will be lost, and there will come a time when we say that this popular wave had dreams, It is the responsibility of the Lebanese to push for a vacuum of power and to form a new government soon. You hear the voice of the people and develop programs to respond to the people under the heading of ""restoring confidence."" The government must provide all elements that inspire confidence. And seriousness to work transparently, and without Alo He also called for a dialogue between all political forces and blocs and the movement, and talk about the American role that prevents Lebanon from leaving its current status.
