      <h1>’Extremely childlike:’ Defence says accused in caseworker death needs assessment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T01:48:15+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 01:48</time> by <a rel="author">CP, The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>A lawyer for an 18-year-old charged with killing his case worker at an assisted-living home says he doubts the young man is fit to stand trial.</p>
      <p>Brandon Newman remains in custody charged with second-degree murder in the death of Deborah Onwu, who was stabbed at the home in southwest Calgary on Oct. 25.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old appeared in court Friday via a video link and said little.</p>
      <p>Defence lawyer Allan Fay said he’s doubtful his client would be capable of properly instructing a lawyer for his defence.</p>
      <p>“I’ve met with him several times,” Fay said outside court. “He strikes me as an extremely child-like individual.”</p>
      <p>Fay asked to have the case put over until Monday, when Newman is to receive an initial assessment from a psychiatrist. That could result in Newman being sent to the Southern Alberta Forensic Psychiatric Centre.</p>

      <p>“If that’s the case, he’ll go there for about 30 days for an assessment. They’ll come back and at that time we’ll determine if we can proceed,” Fay said.</p>
      <p>Police have said it’s believed there was a verbal and physical confrontation between Newman and Onwu, and she was stabbed.</p>
      <p>The union that represented Onwu is calling for higher safety standards and staffing levels to protect other workers.</p>
      <p>Lou Arab, a spokesman with the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said in a statement that Newman has “complex health needs and a violent history” and required two-on-one care.</p>
      <p>Another worker was at the home the night Onwu was killed, he said, but that worker was on a different floor dealing with another client.</p>
      <p>“(Onwu) was working alone and she should not have been,” said Arab.</p>
      <p>Court records show Newman was charged with assault in August. He was to appear in court on that matter later this month.</p>

      <p>Wood’s Homes, which operates mental-health facilities and programs for children and families throughout Alberta, said in a statement Friday that it can’t comment on details about its clients.</p>
      <p>“Wood’s Homes takes its responsibility in promoting a safe workplace very seriously. We are working with our staff to address the issues stemming from this very sad incident.”</p>
      <p>It said it is conducting its own investigation and co-operating with police and the province’s Occupational Health and Safety unit.</p>
      <p>About 10 of Onwu’s friends, some care workers, gathered at court Friday wearing white T-shirts with Onwu’s picture on it and “Justice for Debbie” written on the back.</p>
      <p>“We believe that her death could have been prevented if the safety and the security measures were put in place,” said Rebecca Opoku-Ameyaw.</p>
      <p>“This wouldn’t happen and we wouldn’t be standing here today.”</p>
