      <p>THE US House of Representatives' foreign affairs committee has unanimously passed a resolution reaffirming support for the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
      <p>The resolution, which calls for strict adherence to the Good Friday Agreement during Brexit negotiations, will now advance to the full house for a vote at a future date.</p>
      <p>It also urges the UK and European Union to ensure that Brexit does not threaten peace on the island of Ireland and opposes reintroducing a hard border.</p>
      <p>A similar resolution opposing the return of a hard border was introduced in the US House of Representatives in January.</p>
      <p>Some senior members of the US Congress have previously warned that they will oppose any US-UK trade deal that undermines the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
