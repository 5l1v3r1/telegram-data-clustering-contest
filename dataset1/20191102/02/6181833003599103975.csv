A dívida total da Argentina chega a 315 bilhões de dólares e é quase certo que o governo Fernández irá reestruturá-la.
Fernández, um advogado de 60 anos do peronismo de centro-esquerda, ganhou as presidenciais argentinas no dia 28 de outubro passado, tendo a ex-presidente Cristina Kirchner (2007-2015) como vice.
O mandato tem início no próximo dia 10 de dezembro, substituindo o presidente liberal Mauricio Macri.
