""The CCP does not represent the Chinese""

02 Nov 2019, 02:53

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] On October 30th, US Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo gave a speech at the Hudson Institute in New York, a conservative think tank. He said that the United States has always expected China under the CCP to become a democratic country, thus condoning the CCP in many aspects, but now it is finally realized that the CCP has always been hostile to American values.
He said that the Chinese Communist regime is seeking power to dominate the world, so the world must face up in many areas such as trade, human rights, and sovereignty over the South China Sea. ""The CCP is seeking to challenge the United States and the world in various ways. All of us must face these challenges.""
Pompeo also clearly distinguishes the concepts of ""CCP"" and ""Chinese people"". ""The United States has always valued the friendship with the Chinese people, but the Chinese government and the Chinese people are not the same thing,"" he said.
The following is a full-text translation of the Pompeo speech published by the US Embassy in China:
Thank you all for being so warm and friendly. I often want to get applause (laughter) after the end of the speech, because then I can know how well I behave. Rupert, you talk about the Senate campaign and publishing. I can say with certainty that if I talk about these situations, both are unforgivable sins. (Laughter) So I will not talk about these two things tonight.
Thanks to Rupat for the introduction of many beautiful words.
Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, today I am very happy to be here with you. It is a great honour for me to sit with Dr. Kissinger and Hank Greenberg and Sterns. They are all outstanding for the United States. Excellent people who contributed. Thank you for your excellent service. I have the privilege of knowing Dr. Kissinger. He is over 90 years old. Secretary of State Shultz is also in his 90s. I still have many years to catch up. (Laughter) It must be the relationship of Foggy Bottom that makes you live so long.
I would also like to thank Ken and the board members present for your care. Your tolerance and the award presented tonight made me feel awkward. My son often reminds me that there are many things that can make me feel embarrassed. He - I actually told him about it, he checked it online and looked at all the winners in the past. He wondered if your company had looked away. (laughter)
He also sent an e-mail to the entire team that took care of me during my trip, which made it difficult for the city. The e-mail wrote, ""My father seems to be half-dead when he gets off the plane tonight. Can someone give him makeup?"" (Laughter) I was somewhere in the distance, at 3 o'clock in the morning.
I think I will take a few minutes to review some of the things that have been around me for a long time. I remember that I had hoped that a few hours after President Trump took office in January 2017, he was sworn in as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). But Senator Wyden had different ideas about the time of inauguration, so my business was postponed until Friday.
But at the time I had invited the President to go to the Central Intelligence Agency headquarters in Langley on Saturday morning. On the day of my arrival, when the president was present, I was still a member of the House of Representatives in the 4th district of Kansas, hoping to get 51 confirmation tickets on Monday.
I mentioned this because I will never forget the question that President Trump is highly concerned about. Less than 24 hours after he took the oath of office, he had a meeting with me and senior officials responsible for counter-terrorism matters at the CIA. He talked about three things. He said, I will provide you with everything you need for your work; I will provide you with the authorization you need to do this for the security of the United States; I want to ensure that we can destroy the caliphate. I hope to seize the head of the Islamic State (ISIS). At the same time, (applause) we have been working for two and a half years, this team is very good. Work done in the past can definitely make a significant contribution to the national security of the United States. The president has led the work in this area. He persisted in this. He supported all the work I did, then my successor Haspel, and the Department of Defense and all the team's masterpieces, which ultimately made Baghdadi unable to escape the French Open. (applause)
I hope that you all know that when you have the chance to see people in military uniforms or meet an intelligence officer, you may not recognize them. Some of them are sitting here tonight. You don't know. Please thank them. They have made a great contribution and are crucial.
There is still a lot of work to be done. The threat posed by radical Islamic extremism has not yet disappeared, but the work that has been done before this shows the excellence and uniqueness we have in the United States of America and the degree of superiority we have seen before.
I think we may wish to seriously review the history we have traveled. Half a century ago, your founder set the course for you to think about the future in an unconventional way. When President Trump appointed me as Secretary of State, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency was of course a person who made unconventional thinking about certain things. Who would have thought that this child who grew up in Southern California would receive such a privilege?
He also knows that Herman also knows that for the benefit of the future, in order to preserve what we call the great and noble achievements of the United States of America, no mission is more important than doing a good job in this area.
Because of this, today I want to focus on some issues in a few minutes before answering the question. The work that the Trump administration is doing is different from previous governments. I want to focus on the core issues. This does not involve politics. We only - we have met the requirements of the times and greeted the challenges from the People's Republic of China (CCP).
Please see that we have a tradition of maintaining friendship with the Chinese people. We continue to do this today. In the United States, we have American Chinese groups, and we love and value this group. I know them through the business community and personal contacts. I also know many of them.
However, I must stress that today's Chinese Communist government is not the same as the Chinese people. They strive to challenge the United States and the world in the various ways that are being used.
We need to work together, all of us directly against these challenges from the People's Republic of China (CCP), and from all aspects.
Of course, there are many opportunities, but ignoring the fundamental differences and effects between our two systems—the effects of these two systems, and the impact of their differences on US national security—is no longer a reality.
Undoubtedly, this is a change. It may be considered unconventional. This is not the statement you have heard from the leaders in the past twenty years. Frankly speaking, we are slow to understand the risks of China (the CCP) – the risks it poses to US national security – because we want to build friendships with the People’s Republic from the very beginning. Because we, as Americans, always hope for friendship.
But, frankly, in our efforts to achieve this goal, we have been fulfilling and encouraging the rise of China for decades, even if it is – even when this rise is based on American values, Western democracy, and security. And the legitimate common sense at the expense.
We downgraded our relationship with our long-time friend, Taiwan, and normalized the relationship with Beijing on the condition of peaceful settlement of the ""Taiwan issue.""
When conflicts occur, we often refrain from talking directly about human rights issues and American values. We dilute ideological differences, even after the Tiananmen Square massacre and other major human rights violations.
We encourage China to become a member of the World Trade Organization and other international organizations, as long as they commit to market reforms and compliance with the rules of these organizations. But too often, China (the CCP) has not honored it.
When China (the CCP) threatened neighboring countries like Vietnam and the Philippines, when they claimed sovereignty over the South China Sea, we hesitated and did not do what we should.
Frankly speaking, we have made too much effort for China to rise, and we expect the Communist China to become more free and market-oriented, and ultimately hope to become more democratic.
We have been doing this for a long time.
There is another reason for us to adopt the above policy: we have not realized how China is evolving. Frankly speaking, the American people failed to see the whole situation.
I have spoken to many business leaders. US companies that have invested heavily in China have been forced to accept Chinese (CCP) regulations, including almost any topic that the Chinese Communist Party sees as controversial.
Beijing’s stubbornness has made it a permanent Chinese lobbying group in the United States. Their main mission is to sell channels for building relationships with Chinese (CCP) leaders and business partners.
Frankly speaking, whenever there is a dispute or tension, many of our scholars believe that the United States has misinterpreted the essence of the Chinese Communist Party.
At the same time, Beijing controls and limits the opportunities for our diplomats, journalists and academics to travel while traveling in mainland China. They are still doing this today. If you can see this difference - if you can see the treatment of Chinese (CCP) diplomats and the treatment of American diplomats and their exposure, you will find this is extremely contrary to American values. Unequal situation.
The Chinese (CCP) state-run media and government spokespersons often bridge the gap and often defame US intentions and policy goals. They are still doing this today. They distorted Americans' views on the People's Republic and their comments on General Secretary Xi.
These adverse consequences are completely predictable. They are an inevitable incidental result of dealing with a black-box operating regime that does not respect fairness, the rule of law, and mutual benefit.
Today, we finally realize the extent to which the Chinese Communist Party is truly hostile to the United States and our values, as well as its worse words and deeds and influence on us. We can do this because of the leadership of President Trump.
The President has raised this issue and this warning since the first day of his presidency. I remember that in his speech in Pennsylvania, he called China (CCP) a member of the WTO as ""the biggest job steal in history."" Many people laughed at the time. I think today, I see that reality, not so many people are laughing.
Now we know that China (the CCP) has weakened the US manufacturing industry by stealing intellectual property on a large scale. Last week I hosted a group of Fortune 500 companies in the office. Those experiences are amazing.
Now we also know that China (the CCP) threatens the freedom of Americans by forcing our companies to conduct self-censorship in order to maintain market access in China. We have all seen the experience of the recent NBA. The reason is that Beijing should be free to carry out its own public relations campaign; they are sovereign states. But if we have different opinions, our company should be allowed to maintain its different views. It is completely unacceptable to suppress dissent.
Now we know that now we know that China (the CCP) develops asymmetric weapons, threatens the national security of the United States, and threatens our strategic assets.
More can be listed.
These are not only our problems, they are problems of all countries that share our same values.
When we see Beijing's use of coercion as a priority, it is unfavorable for us to believe that democracy and sovereignty are basic conventions and should dominate the way of world commerce and national transactions. These ideas threaten a free and open international order by extending territorial and maritime sovereignty beyond legal proceedings in places like the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.
We also know that Beijing has involved neighboring countries and other countries in its state-led economic model, often using bribes to reach deals, often causing many countries to be in debt and incapacity, and their sovereignty is threatened.
Now we also know and can see the basic human rights of the Chinese (CCP) regime trampling on its own citizens, the great and noble Chinese people. We have seen this in Hong Kong, where they need to fulfil their pledges and commitments; we also see this from the serious violations of the human rights of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.
We also know that the Chinese Communist Party is providing a completely different governance model to its people and the world. In this model, a Leninist Party rule, and everyone must think and act in accordance with the will of the Communist elite. This is not a future that I hope. I don’t think this is the future that anyone here is hoped for. This is not the future that other democracies hope, nor is it a Chinese people. The Chinese people who love freedom are everywhere. I don't want to have this model.
President Trump’s National Security Strategy clarifies this and indicates that China (the CCP) is a strategic competitor. This means that there are challenges and tangible opportunities, and we hope that we can reach them in a constructive way. But this is reality, this is the truth.
We have not chosen some of these issues, and this is also true. China (the CCP) imposes them on us.
In the coming months, I will deliver a series of speeches. I will talk more specifically about each of these issues.
I will talk about competing ideologies and values and their impact on the United States and the world. The Communist Party of China is a Marxist-Leninist Party that focuses on struggle and international domination. We only need to listen to the words of their leaders.
I will also talk about how they intervene in what we consider to be the most natural in the United States. The party’s intelligence agency, the United Front Work, and its propaganda branch have launched a global campaign to turn public opinion toward Beijing. We want to uphold our freedom - our freedom of speech, and we want to make sure that information flows freely everywhere.
And I will also talk about the impact of the international order. Beijing is actively creating its own international space, and it participates in international organizations to allow its authoritarian system to exist and expand its scope. And in the United States, I believe that the outstanding people belonging to the Hudson Institute must maintain the existing free and open international order that the United States helped to create and continue to lead.
I will also - will also talk about the economy. China (the CCP) engages in unfair predatory economic behavior and uses state-owned assets to lay down its economic footprint around the world. We hope that China will succeed. We hope that it has a successful economy. We want a transparent, competitive, market-driven system that benefits all participants.
You can see the first step towards this from the first phase of the agreement we are close to signing. I am optimistic that we will be able to achieve. This is a good thing and an area where we can work together. We want to make sure that we are doing it right, and we want to make sure that economic relations are fair, equitable, and balanced between us. I think this will show that there is something in common, and the Trump administration will work tirelessly to find it anywhere we can.
I will also have an organic talk about how our military is competing, and the relevant capabilities that China (the CCP) has built far beyond their self-defense.
There will be many discussions about the relationship between the United States and China in the coming years and decades, and there will be many discussions, discussions in many think tanks, and discussions in many academic circles. I will clarify what the United States hopes: we do not want to confront the People’s Republic of China. And in fact, what we want is exactly the opposite.
We hope to see a prosperous China living side by side with its own people and its neighbors.
We hope to see a prosperous China, the business community of China doing business with other parts of the world based on a series of fair reciprocal rules that we all know and understand.
We hope to see a liberalized China that allows its people's ingenuity to be fully realized.
And we want to see a China that respects the basic human rights of its own people, as guaranteed by its own constitution.
But most importantly, as an American, it is vital that our contacts with China are based on their current situation, not what we want.
Herman Kahn reminded us that he had urged us to think in an unconventional way, to come up with convincing policy arguments, and to consistently explain these arguments to the American people.
We must think about the People's Republic of China in a new, unconventional way of thinking.
I hope that you all do this with me. We will learn together and we will develop a strong relationship between the two countries.
I will talk about it here and answer a few questions now.
Thank you all. God bless everyone. (applause)
