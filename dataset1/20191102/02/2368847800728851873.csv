眾院通過彈劾程序議案 伊萬卡:國父也曾被小人圍攻

02 Nov 2019, 02:21

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】美國眾議院內本週三晚間通過了對川普的彈劾調查程序議案，讓國會在對總統彈劾期間進行調查時擁有2項新的權力：問詢證人時可通過電視轉播方式公開；問詢時限也被延長。對此，川普和共和黨人均發起了反擊，伊萬卡也在社交媒體上聲援川普，她並以當年美國國父之一的托馬斯•傑斐遜也曾遭政敵圍攻的實例來鼓勵川普。她說：「一些事從來沒有改變，爸爸！」
綜合《國會山》和POLITICO新聞報導的消息，當地時間10月31日上午，美國眾議院啟動對川普的彈劾調查程序議案的投票。投票結果是232票贊成，196票反對。大部分民主黨投了贊成票，而所有共和黨議員都投了反對票，2位民主黨籍議員倒戈投了反對票，一名無黨籍議員投了贊成票。兩黨共有4人棄權或並沒有投票。
去年11月舉行的美國中期選舉中，民主黨重新奪回眾議院多數黨派地位，在人數上佔優。
外界觀察發現，本次通過的彈劾調查程序議案並沒有多少實質性內容，大篇幅講述的是美國憲法的定義和眾議院職能，因此被VOX新聞網評論為「象徵性的」的議案。
不過，本次議案獲得通過後，眾議院在今後的彈劾調查中就可以用於兩個便利條件：其一，向證人的問詢聽證可通過電視轉播方式對外公開；其二，調查人員盤問證人的時間因此得以增加。
眾議院的這場投票結束後，當晚川普即在社交媒體上接連發言，抨擊民主黨製造了「美國史上最大獵巫運動」。他表示，當自己為了美國人民忙裡忙外時，民主黨人卻「什麼都不做」，「讓美國人民失望」。他並指出，「彈劾騙局」只會傷害到股市。結果當晚美股三大股指果然普跌，道指盤中跌破250點。
川普還在社交媒體上連續轉發了至少19條共和黨籍議員支持總統、批評民主黨人為一己黨派利益而不顧美國利益的推文。
投票結束後更有十幾位共和黨籍議員在記者會上強烈抨擊民主黨的做法，大力稱贊川普就任總統以來為美國作出的傑出貢獻。POLITICO新聞網形容現場的氣氛就像一場「川普競選拉力活動」。
眾議院共和黨領袖凱文•麥肯錫稱，自從川普當選，民主黨就一直在攻擊他的總統合法性。「這是有罪推定，他們從沒有接受一個事實：是美國人民把川普選出來的。」
共和黨籍議員澤爾迪則怒懟民主黨人一直在耍花招，嗆聲讓他們把掌握的所謂「通烏門」通話記錄放出來，「來點乾貨！」
身為美國第一千金的伊萬卡也出面為自己父親站台，她在社交媒體上發帖指出，川普當前的遭遇，就如同當年美國國父托馬斯•傑斐遜遭到政敵圍攻一樣。
伊萬卡援引了美國國父之一托馬斯•傑斐遜曾寫給他女兒瑪莎的一封信：「我被敵人和間諜包圍，我每說一句話，每寫一個字，他們都會來歪曲我的意思。如果事實與他們相違背，他們就要捏造事實。」
接着，伊萬卡對川普發出了一句鼓勵的話：「一些事情什麼都沒變呢，爸爸！」

The House of Representatives passed the impeachment procedure. Ivanka: The founding father was also besieged by the villain.

02 Nov 2019, 02:21

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] The US House of Representatives passed a motion on the impeachment investigation procedure for Trump on Wednesday night, allowing Congress to have two new powers during the investigation of the impeachment of the president: inquiring witnesses The time can be disclosed by means of television broadcast; the time limit for inquiries has also been extended. In this regard, Trump and Republicans have launched a counterattack, Ivanka also supported Trump on social media, and she encouraged Trump with Thomas Jefferson, one of the fathers of the United States, who was also besieged by political opponents. . She said: ""Some things have never changed, Dad!""
According to news from the ""Capitol Hill"" and POLITICO news, on the morning of October 31, local time, the US House of Representatives initiated a vote on Trump's impeachment investigation procedure. The result of the vote was 232 votes in favor and 196 votes against. Most of the Democratic Party voted in favor, and all Republican lawmakers voted against it. Two Democrats voted against it and a non-party member voted in favor. A total of four people abstained from the two parties or did not vote.
In the mid-term elections held in November last year, the Democratic Party regained the majority party status of the House of Representatives and dominated the number.
Outside observations revealed that the impeachment investigation procedure passed this time did not have much substantive content. The large-scale article described the definition of the US Constitution and the functions of the House of Representatives, so it was commented by the VOX News Network as a ""symbolic"" motion.
However, after the passage of this motion, the House of Representatives can use two convenient conditions in future impeachment investigations: first, the hearing of the witnesses can be made public through television broadcast; second, the investigators interrogate the witnesses. Time has therefore increased.
After the vote in the House of Representatives ended, Trump spoke on social media that night, slamming the Democratic Party for creating the ""biggest witch hunting movement in American history."" He said that when he was busy with the American people, the Democrats ""do nothing"" and ""disappoint the American people."" He also pointed out that ""the impeachment scam"" will only hurt the stock market. As a result, the three major stock indexes of the US stock market fell sharply that night, and the Dow fell below 250 points.
Trump also continually forwarded at least 19 Republican members to support the president and criticize the Democrats for their own party interests, regardless of US interests.
After the vote ended, more than a dozen Republican lawmakers strongly criticized the Democratic Party’s practice at the press conference and strongly praised Trump’s outstanding contribution to the United States since he took office. POLITICO News Network described the atmosphere at the scene as a ""Champ campaign rally.""
House Republican leader Kevin McKinsey said that since Trump was elected, the Democratic Party has been attacking the legitimacy of his president. ""This is a guilty presumption. They have never accepted the fact that it was the American people who chose Trump.""
Republican lawmaker Zeldi screamed that the Democrats had been playing tricks and let them release the so-called ""Tongwumen"" call records that they had mastered. ""Come on dry goods!""
Ivanka, who is the first daughter of the United States, also appeared for her father's platform. She posted on social media that Trump's current experience is like the besieged American father Thomas Jefferson was besieged by political opponents.
Ivanka quoted a letter from one of the fathers of the United States, Thomas Jefferson, to his daughter Martha: ""I am surrounded by enemies and spies. Every time I say a word, every time I write a word, they will distort me. If the facts are contrary to them, they will fabricate the facts.""
Then, Ivanka sent a word of encouragement to Trump: ""Some things haven't changed, Dad!""
