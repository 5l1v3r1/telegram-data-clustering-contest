冷凍貨櫃39屍案 英警改口：死者全為越南籍

02 Nov 2019, 02:27

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】英國艾塞克斯郡（Essex）23日在一輛冷凍貨櫃內發現39具屍體，警方起初稱死者全為中國偷渡客，後來傳出其中有多名越南籍人士，經過英國警方持續追查發現，稱「我們認為所有受害者都是越南公民」。
被英國媒體稱為「鐵棺材」的冷凍貨櫃事件爆發後，由於受害者攜帶的身分證件稀少，辨識身分不易，一度傳出死者全為中國籍，但後來發現可能是越南籍人士使用偽造的中國護照。
同時，不少越南家屬憂心死者可能是自己的親屬，紛紛向媒體與警方通報。目前39名死者仍在進行驗屍，以辨明死因。
英國廣播公司（BBC）報導，艾塞克斯郡警方表示，已經直接聯絡上部分死者在英國或越南的家屬，也和越南政府有聯繫。
助理警察局長史密斯（Tim Smith）表示：「現階段我們認為所有受害者都是越南公民，並和越南政府保持密切聯繫。」但他表示，目前無法證實任何一名受害者的身分。
越南駐倫敦使館指出：「受害者的確切身分仍須進一步證實，並由在越南或英國的家屬確認。」



冷凍貨櫃由比利時濟布魯治（Zeebrugge）港口出發，跨海抵達英國艾塞克斯的泰晤士河港口柏佛利特（Purfleet），貨櫃抵達集運中心後司機羅賓森（Maurice Robinson）把貨櫃拖走，約23日凌晨1時30分，羅賓森把車停在華特格雷德工業園區（Waterglade Industrial Park），他下車後發現貨櫃內屍體後報警，隨後遭警方逮捕。
羅賓森事後被控「39項過失殺人、共謀販運人口、共謀協助非法移民以及洗錢罪名。」另有3人因涉及本案在英國境內被捕，他們包括居住在英格蘭西北部瓦林登（Warrington）的38歲男子和38歲女子，據稱兩人是夫婦。據悉，女子是那輛卡車的法定所有人；另一名48歲北愛爾蘭男子也被拘押。
26日又在北愛爾蘭都柏林港逮捕一名23歲司機哈里森（Eamon Harrison），英國政府正展開引渡程序至英國受審。哈里森涉嫌駕駛貨櫃車將冷凍貨櫃運到比利時澤布呂赫港，貨櫃其後由貨船運抵英國。
越南事後也嚴查人蛇仲介偷渡，河靜省（Ha Tinh）已有兩人因相關罪名遭到起訴。
