      <p>Trump says of the impeachment inquiry that "it always helps when you didn't do anything wrong."</p>
      <p>But he adds, "We're going to send a signal by sending a terrific new Republican governor to Jackson."</p>
      <p>Democratic candidate Jim Hood is wrapping up his fourth term as attorney general and making it a competitive race in a conservative Deep South state where Trump is popular.</p>

      <p>Trump is trying to energize voters in Mississippi as he campaigns for the Republican nominee for governor in next week's off-year election.</p>
      <p>Addressing supporters in Iowa, O'Rourke said Friday that he made the decision to exit the race "reluctantly" and vowed to stay active in the fight to defeat Trump</p>

      <p>President Donald Trump is reveling in the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as he campaigns for Republicans in Mississippi.</p>
      <p>U.S. special operations forces concluded a successful operation Saturday that ended with al-Baghdadi blowing himself up.</p>
      <p>Trump said Friday: "He was a savage and soulless monster, but his reign of terror is over."</p>
      <p>Trump says America's special forces executed a masterful raid and ended his wretched life, adding, "They punched out his ticket now, I guess you could say."</p>
      <p>Trump was in Mississippi to shore up Republican support for Lt Gov. Tate Reeves, who is locked in a tight race to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in next week's off-year election.</p>
      <p>Democratic attorney general Jim Hood is one of the most conservative elected Democrats in the country and is making it a competitive race.</p>
