      <p>(Reuters) - California Governor Gavin Newsom said he will convene a meeting of Pacific Gas and Electric Co executives, shareholders, wildfire victims, and PG&amp;E’s other creditors in Sacramento next week to speed up the resolution of the bankruptcy case that creates a new entity.</p>
      <p>The new company can only happen “if we first get out of bankruptcy court,” Newsom said in a statement on Friday, without elaborating on his plans.</p>
      <p>“If the parties fail to reach an agreement quickly to begin this process of transformation, the state will not hesitate to step in and restructure the utility,” he added.</p>
      <p>The San Francisco-based power producer in January filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection anticipating its liabilities from massive wildfires in 2017 and 2018 blamed on its equipment could top $30 billion.</p>
      <p>Earlier in October, Newsom said PG&amp;E should be held accountable for mismanaging widespread power shutoffs, and urged the company to provide credits or rebates to affected customers.</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E, which began shutting off power to 940,000 California customers over the past weekend to guard against the risk of an electrical mishap sparking a blaze, said late on Thursday it had restored electricity to virtually all customers.</p>
