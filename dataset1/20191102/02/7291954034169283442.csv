– Etter et angrep på en FAMA-stilling (de væpnede styrkene i Mali) i Indelimane, har tilkalte styrker funnet 54 døde, opplyser landets kommunikasjonsminister Yaya Sangare på Twitter. Ministeren legger til at én av dem som er funnet, var en sivil person. Resten er drepte soldater.
Ifølge Reuters ligger den aktuelle basen nær Ménaka nordøst i landet. Det oppgis ikke hvem som skal ha stått bak angrepet eller hvor mange av dem som eventuelt ble drept.
Jihadistiske, islamistiske ekstremister og kriminelle grupperinger er et stort problem i avsidesliggende områder i Mali, der også etniske konflikter er en stor utfordring, og militærbaser i Mali blir angrepet og plyndret.
Uroen i Mali begynte med et militærkupp og et påfølgende tuareg-opprør nord i landet i 2012.

Greta Thunberg alludes to fires in California to illustrate climate crisis
The Swedish teenager visited the California city of Paradise this week, which was destroyed last year by the flames
02 Nov 2019, 02:18 by El Periódico
The Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, leader of the youth movement against the environmental crisis, asked on Friday in Los Angeles that the world's catastrophe is no longer ignored and set an example of the fires that currently plague California.
The young woman joined in downtown Los Angeles a protest called by the Youth Climate Strike LA organization, aimed at demanding world leaders to establish policies that contribute to the fight against climate change and to eliminate fossil fuel production .
""We are currently experiencing the beginning of a climate and ecological catastrophe and we cannot ignore this crisis anymore,"" Thunberg said.
""I wonder: Why is it so difficult to understand? We are repeating the same message over and over again ... Scientists are repeating (the same message) over and over again, and have not heard them yet,"" he insisted. .
The young woman also addressed the governor of California, Democrat Gavin Newsom, and state legislators to suspend the nine oil drilling in the state and to at least establish a minimum space of 2,500 feet (762 meters) between the sites of drilling and residential areas.
Thunberg considered that the increase in fires that have hit California in recent years is a sign of how climate change affects the entire world.
""Today in California we are seeing all this destruction on the corner,"" he said, referring to the fires that keep the Los Angeles metropolitan area in check, which is comprised of five counties.
For three weeks, California has been facing heavy fires that have forced the evacuation of more than 200,000 people and have forced power companies to schedule power outages due to the strong winds that can tear down cables and cause outbreaks of fire, something that has left millions of people without electricity.
The 16-year-old Swedish teenager visited the Californian city of Paradise this week, which was destroyed last year by the flames in another big fire.
""I met with survivors who showed me street after street where there was no home left and I heard stories that broke my heart,"" he said.
""People are suffering from these emergencies and ecological disasters that will continue to worsen, this must mean something to those who make the decisions,"" he said.
Thunberg, who has inspired millions of young people throughout the world, argued that rulers are putting their short-term interests above human lives, the planet, and the future.
""Why do the people in power continue to pretend that everything is fine and assume that we can continue living as we do now without a tomorrow?"" The young woman questioned, while hundreds of young people applauded their claims in front of the Los Angeles City Council.
""But if there is a tomorrow, that tomorrow is where we young people are going to live, and we have to fight for that tomorrow and we need to protect it as if our lives depended on it,"" he said.
