      <p>The study, which was conducted by the Center for Drug Use and HIV/HCV Research (CDUHR) at New York University’s College of Global Public Health, also found that construction workers are the second most-likely occupation to use marijuana, trailing only service workers.</p>
      <blockquote>“Construction workers are at an increased risk for drug use, which makes them vulnerable to work-related injuries or even overdose deaths,” Danielle Ompad, the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/art_living/201910301077182103-men-funnier-than-women-study/">study’s</a> lead author and an associate professor of epidemiology at the College of Global Public Health, said in an <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2019/october/of-all-professions--construction-workers-most-likely-to-use-opio.html">October 30 press release</a>. The release cites other recent studies indicating that construction workers are six to seven times more likely to die from an opioid overdose than those in other professions.</blockquote>
      <p>The study surveyed information on almost 300,000 Americans <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201911011077195137-new-study-reveals-possible-mysterious-new-black-hole/">collected</a> by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health over a 10-year period. Around 17,000 construction workers were asked about how often they used drugs, and their results were compared to workers in 13 other professions. </p>
      <blockquote>Many people in the construction industry may suffer from falls or other accidents that cause them to turn to opioids to manage pain.</blockquote>
      <p>“It makes sense that we see higher rates of construction workers using pain-relieving substances such as opioids and marijuana, given the labor-intensive nature of their work and high rates of injuries,” Ompad added in the press release. The <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911011077198904-indias-jobless-rates-reality---nine-million-new-unemployed-over-six-years--study/">study</a>, published Wednesday in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence, also found that construction workers with unstable employment or those that frequently skipped work were more likely to use narcotics. A <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/54199041.pdf">2015 report</a> found that job insecurity among construction workers could be attributed to several factors, including employment downsizing or a broader financial crisis in a country, as well as advances in technology which may reduce the need for human workers. Women in the field may also face some challenges in what is perceived to be a mostly male-dominated occupation. </p>
