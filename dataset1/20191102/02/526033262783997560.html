      <p>Fire Drill Fridays is a weekly protest organized to pressure lawmakers into taking action on preventing climate change. Fonda's fourth protest centered on promoting women's involvement in the movement.</p>
      <p>"Climate change is a women's issue. ... While the climate crisis threatens everyone, it especially impacts vulnerable populations, including women and girls," Fire Drill Fridays said in a statement.</p>

      <p>Fonda's first arrest came on Oct. 11 after she vowed to be arrested every Friday until January to protest climate change.</p>
      <p>"This is a crisis unlike anything that has faced humankind," Fonda told ABC News Deputy Political Director MaryAlice Parks. "The reason that I'm here every Friday, with Fire Drill Fridays, is because I think every single human being has to say, 'What can I do?'</p>
      <p>"There's only one issue that will determine the survival of our species."</p>
