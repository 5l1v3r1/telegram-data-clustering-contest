WASHINGTON (CNN) - Energy Secretary Rick Perry will not participate in a closed-door deposition with impeachment investigators but would consider testifying in an open hearing, according to the Department of Energy.
""The Secretary will not partake in a secret star chamber inquisition where agency counsel is forbidden to be present,"" department spokesperson Shaylyn Hynes said in a statement Friday.
But, Hynes added, ""If the committee is interested in conducting a serious proceeding they are welcome to send for the Secretary's consideration an invitation to participate in an open hearing where the Department's counsel can be present and the American people can witness.""
Perry had been asked to appear before the three committees conducting the impeachment inquiry on Wednesday.
Perry, who plans to leave his post at year's end, had been under scrutiny over his role in the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine.

This is a breaking news story and will be updated.
