文革一幕:「打倒習近平」呼聲震耳 習絕望地哭了

02 Nov 2019, 02:54

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】如今大權在握的習近平也有過一段絕望的日子，文革開始時，習剛13歲就被打成反革命分子。中共黨校召開的批鬥會上，「打倒習近平」呼聲震耳，習媽媽齊心也被迫喊口號打倒兒子……一個雨夜，習偷偷回到家中，媽媽嚇壞了，舉報去了，習絕望地哭了，又絕望地跑進了雨夜。
習近平的父親習仲勳「忘年之交」楊屏在《快樂老人報》刊發文章講述，他和習仲勳先後都下放到河南洛陽勞動，成為了「忘年交」。
1976年6月某晚8點多，楊屏來到洛陽耐火材料廠家屬區習仲勳的住處，一室一廳，連廚房廁所都加起來，總面積大約將近40平方米。
進門後，看到習仲勳反常地低頭坐在八仙桌的旁邊，沒有看他，也沒有打招呼，一臉淚痕。桌子上擺了一碟油炸花生米，一個杯子，一瓶白酒。
老爺子吩咐他去廚房拿個杯子來一起喝酒，並流着眼淚說：「今天是你近平哥哥的生日，你來陪我喝點酒，給他過個生日。」他擦了好幾遍眼淚說：「因為我，你近平哥哥可是九死一生啊！」
楊屏回憶，習仲勳當晚哭了兩個小時還不止，一邊哭着，一邊重複地說，對不起孩子們，對不起家裡所有的人。

習年少時經受過非人的折磨

在習仲勳的講述中，楊屏得知習近平年少時，經受過非人的折磨。
文化大革命開始時，習近平剛13歲，只因為說了幾句反對文化大革命的話，就被打成了現行反革命分子。被列為敵我矛盾，在中央黨校的院子裡關押了起來。
中央黨校召開批判6個走資派的大會，最後一個人就是習近平，前5個是大人，第一個是楊獻珍，6個人戴着鐵制的高帽子，帽子重壓的受不了，習近平只好用兩隻手托着。
習媽媽齊心就坐在台下，台上喊「打倒習近平」時，媽媽齊心被迫也要舉手喊口號打倒她兒子。
批鬥完了，近在咫尺，母子也不能相見。
一天夜裡下大雨，趁看守不注意，習近平跳窗戶跑回家，媽媽嚇壞了，問他怎麼回來了？「媽媽，我餓。」習近平哆哆嗦嗦地說。想讓媽媽給弄點吃的，然後，進房間換衣服。
習近平萬萬沒有想到，媽媽不但沒有給他做飯吃，反而在他不知情的情況下，冒着大雨向領導報告去了。習近平知道不是媽媽心狠，而是被迫無奈。如果不去報告，就是包庇現行反革命，媽媽也會被抓走，那樣，遠平和安安怎麼辦？他倆還是小孩子啊！
飢腸轆轆的習近平，當着姊姊安安和弟弟遠平的面絕望地哭了，又絕望地跑進了雨夜。
最後，頤和園一個看工地的老頭兒收留了他，讓習近平在一張連椅上熬過了一夜，第二天，就被抓進少管所勞動改造。
北京市許多城建基礎設施，比如西城區的地下排污管道的修建，習近平都流過淚，因為，他幹活的時候，上面有警察拿着棒子！

習仲勳曾被折磨得「精神失常」

據報導，習近平的父親習仲勳在60年代因別人描寫中共陝北根據地前領導人的小說《劉志丹》，而被打成「叛徒」，文革中受殘酷迫害，審查、關押、監護前後長達16年。
他被折磨得「精神失常」，一度要裝瘋賣儍，只為保護自己的家人不受株連。毛澤東死後習仲勳獲得平反，並被委以重任，主管廣東。
從主管廣東那時起，深受中共迫害之苦的習仲勳，就曾告誡一個女兒，「夾著尾巴做人。」他還要求子女們有機會都「遠走高飛」，留在國內「說不定某天就會受政治迫害，更不用說報效祖國了」。
但他也要求留下習近平一個從政，並教導習如何為人如何做官。

習16歲再過生死劫 

1966年，習仲勳被打為「黑幫」，正在上學的習近平作為反動學生，被關進了學習班。為了暫避風頭，習近平要求響應當時的「上山下山」的要求，到父親曾經工作過的陝北延川縣梁家河插隊。他的請求得到了批准。
1969年的冬天，16歲的習近平和其他兩萬多名知青一起踏上了西去的列車。習回憶，在去延安的專列上，所有人都在哭泣，只有他在笑。送行的親人感到奇怪，問他為何發笑。
習近平說：「我不走就要哭了。我不走的話，在北京有命沒命都不知道了。我可以走不是好事嗎？你們哭什麼呢？」
送行的親人聽到習近平回答後破涕為笑。
習近平表示，自己當時去陝北並沒有什麼目的，就是把它作為一個棲身之地，甚至是逃避之地。
不過，從北京到農村的習近平頃刻間無法適應環境天翻地覆的改變，那裡艱苦到習近平總是因為餓、冷，而且無法入眠。
三個月後，他就返回北京。沒想到的是，當時北京風聲正緊，他又被作為倒流人口被管制起來，一關就是半年。
半年後再出來，真正是孑然一身，舉目無親了，擺在他面前的路只有一條，就是回延安。這一次，他一呆就是7年。
弟弟習遠平去看他時，僅一天就起了渾身水皰，原來，習近平為防跳蚤咬，在炕席下灑了厚厚一層666粉，他一年四季就睡在666粉上。
習近平不斷地對弟弟說對不起，並叮嚀回家絕對不許告訴媽媽。回家後習遠平還是告訴了媽媽，因為他自己渾身爛得血肉模糊的，媽媽一眼就看出來了，母子痛哭。
在梁家河村，習近平過了7年，種地、拉煤、打壩、挑糞……什麼活都干過。
《洛杉磯時代週刊》曾刊對習在年輕時期的艱苦條件進行詳細描述：「炕上只有一張很薄的棉被，只有一個木桶當做廁所，晚餐基本只有小米粥和粗糧」。
知青「上山下鄉」曾被指責是「變相勞改」，從1950年代到1970年代末，上山下鄉的知青總數估計在約1,200萬至1,800萬人之間。
很多人未能獲安排返回城市，知青死亡、精神分裂者為數不少。據說，1974至1979年有2萬5690知青死亡，其中60%是非正常死亡。成為一代人的慘痛記憶。
在中南海高層中，包括習近平、李克強、王岐山等人都有過類似經歷。
據悉，王岐山曾把這段知青經歷經驗放在了反腐運動中，在受到威脅時，他調侃：「有人說知識分子打不過流氓，我們知青過來的人就是流氓，怕誰？！」

The scene of the Cultural Revolution: ""Down with Xi Jinping"", crying, crying desperately

02 Nov 2019, 02:54

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] Xi Jinping, who is now in power, has had a period of desperation. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Xi Gang was labeled as a counter-revolutionary when he was 13 years old. At the commemorative meeting held by the Communist Party School of the Communist Party of China, ""Dr. Xi Jinping"" was crying. My mother was forced to shout slogans and beat her son... A rainy night, the sneaked back home, the mother was frightened, reported the report, and cried desperately. And desperately ran into the rainy night.
Xi Jinping's father, Xi Zhongxun, ""Forgot the Year"", Yang Ping published an article in ""Happy Old Man"", telling him that he and Xi Zhongxun were both released to work in Luoyang, Henan Province, and became ""forgetting the year"".
At 8 o'clock in the evening of June 1976, Yang Ping came to the residence of Xi Zhongxun, a refractory manufacturer in Luoyang. He had a room and a hall, and even the kitchen and toilet were added up. The total area was about 40 square meters.
After entering the door, I saw that Xi Zhongxun looked down at the side of the Eight Immortals table. He didn't look at him, didn't say hello, and looked like a tear. On the table was a dish of fried peanuts, a cup, and a bottle of white wine.
The old man told him to go to the kitchen to take a cup to drink together, and said with tears: ""Today is the birthday of your brother, you come to drink with me and give him a birthday."" He wiped his tears several times. : ""Because I, you are a brother, but you have a life of nine!""
Yang Ping recalled that Xi Zhongxun had been crying for two hours that night. He cried and repeatedly said, sorry for the children, sorry for all the people in the family.

Experienced inhuman torture when the young age

In Xi Zhongxun's remarks, Yang Ping learned that Xi Jinping had experienced non-human torture when he was young.
At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Xi Jinping was just 13 years old. He was beaten into the current counter-revolutionary only because he spoke a few words against the Cultural Revolution. It was listed as a contradiction between the enemy and the enemy and was detained in the courtyard of the Central Party School.
The Central Party School held a conference to criticize six capitalists. The last one was Xi Jinping. The first five were adults. The first one was Yang Xianzhen. Six people wore high iron hats. The hats could not stand the pressure. Xi Jinping had to use two. Hold your hand.
When her mother was sitting on the stage together and shouting ""Down Xi Jinping"" on the stage, her mother was forced to raise her hand and shout slogans to defeat her son.
After the trial is over, it is close at hand, and the mother and the child cannot meet each other.
It was raining one night, and the guards did not pay attention. Xi Jinping jumped out of the window and ran home. My mother was frightened and asked how he came back? ""Mom, I am hungry,"" Xi Jinping said slyly. I want my mother to get some food, then go into the room and change clothes.
Xi Jinping never imagined that his mother not only did not cook for him, but instead reported to the leader with heavy rain without his knowledge. Xi Jinping knew that it was not her mother's heart, but she was forced to helpless. If you don't report it, you will cover the current counter-revolution, and your mother will be taken away. Then, what about Yuanping and Anan? They are still young children!
The hungry Xi Jinping cried in despair in the face of Yan Anan and his younger brother Yuan Ping, and ran into the rainy night desperately.
Finally, the old man who saw the construction site in the Summer Palace took him in, let Xi Jinping spend a night in a chair, and the next day, he was arrested and reformed.
Many urban construction infrastructures in Beijing, such as the construction of underground sewage pipes in Xicheng District, Xi Jinping have flowed through tears, because when he was working, there were police officers holding sticks!

Xi Zhongxun was tortured to ""mental disorder""

According to reports, Xi Jinping’s father, Xi Zhongxun, was labeled as a “traitor” in the 1960s because he described the novel “Liu Zhidan” of the former leader of the Shaanxi Northern Base. He was brutally persecuted during the Cultural Revolution, and he was examined, detained and supervised for 16 years.
He was tortured to be ""mental"" and once wanted to be mad and stupid, only to protect his family from the company. After the death of Mao Zedong, Xi Zhongxun was rehabilitated and was assigned a heavy responsibility to be in charge of Guangdong.
From the time he was in charge of Guangdong, Xi Zhongxun, who was deeply victimized by the CCP’s persecution, once warned a daughter, “It’s a man with a tail.” He also asked his children to have the opportunity to “go far away” and stay in the country. “Maybe someday. Will be subject to political persecution, not to mention serving the motherland.""
But he also asked Xi Jinping to stay in politics and teach him how to be an official.

Xi 16 years old and then dying

In 1966, Xi Zhongxun was called a ""gangster"", and Xi Jinping, who was attending school, was a reactionary student and was placed in a class. In order to avoid the limelight, Xi Jinping asked to respond to the request of ""going down the mountain"" at that time, and went to the Liangjiahe River in Yanchuan County of northern Shaanxi where his father had worked. His request was approved.
In the winter of 1969, 16-year-old Xi Jinping and other more than 20,000 educated youths set foot on the west train. Xi recalled that on the special train to Yan'an, everyone was crying, only he was laughing. The relatives who sent off were surprised and asked why he laughed.
Xi Jinping said: ""I will cry when I am not going. If I don't leave, I don't know if I have a life in Beijing. Is it not a good thing for me to go? What are you crying?""
The relatives who saw off the line heard Xi Jinping’s answer and broke into laughter.
Xi Jinping said that he did not have any purpose to go to northern Shaanxi at that time, that is, to use it as a place to live, or even to escape.
However, Xi Jinping from Beijing to the countryside could not adapt to the ever-changing changes in the environment. Xi Jinping was always hungry, cold, and unable to sleep.
Three months later, he returned to Beijing. Unexpectedly, at that time, the wind in Beijing was tight, and he was regulated as a backward population. The first level was half a year.
After coming out half a year later, it was really a stunned one, and there was only one thing in front of him. It was back to Yan’an. This time, he stayed for seven years.
When Xi Yuanping went to see him, he only got blistering in just one day. It turned out that Xi Jinping was a flea-proof bite. He sprinkled a thick layer of 666 powder under the banquet. He slept on 666 powder all year round.
Xi Jinping constantly said sorry to his younger brother, and he refused to tell his mother when he went home. After returning home, Xi Yuanping still told her mother that because of his own bloody and fuzzy, the mother saw it at a glance, and the mother and the child cried.
In Liangjiahe Village, Xi Jinping has been through the land for seven years, planting land, pulling coal, hitting dams, picking manure...
""Los Angeles Times"" published a detailed description of the hardships of Xi’s youth: ""There is only a thin quilt on the raft, only one casks as a toilet, and dinner is basically only millet porridge and coarse grains.""
The educated youth ""going to the mountains and going to the countryside"" was accused of ""disguised labor reform."" From the 1950s to the end of the 1970s, the total number of educated youths going to the countryside was estimated to be between 12 million and 18 million.
Many people have not been arranged to return to the city, and there are many deaths and schizophrenics. It is said that between 1974 and 1979, there were 25,690 educated youth deaths, 60% of which were abnormal deaths. Be a painful memory of a generation.
In the high-level Zhongnanhai, including Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang, Wang Qishan and others have had similar experiences.
It is reported that Wang Qishan once put this experience of educated youth in the anti-corruption movement. When threatened, he ridiculed: ""Some people say that intellectuals can't beat rogues. The people we know come from are rogues, who are you afraid?!""
