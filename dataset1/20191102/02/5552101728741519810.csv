夏于喬扮AV女優玩摔角　談尺度嚇到導演尪
02 Nov 2019, 02:10 by 翁健偉, 李鍾泉
AV女優改行打女子摔角！？這麼異想天開的劇情，卻是電影《女優，摔吧》不折不扣的內容，在歷經一個半月後的拍攝，終於宣告殺青。夏于喬、鬼鬼、黃心娣三位女主角既包辦了所有的動作戲，連「愛情動作片」的戲份也順便拍了，讓人很好奇到底這部片想走什麼級呢？
片中有大量的摔角場面，當然不輕鬆，鬼鬼說拍戲前的訓練，約莫有15堂課、每堂課都3小時，甚至有幾天連續上到8小時之久。因為開拍前大量的訓練，夏于喬一度受傷，只好請假，「我不知道是何時受傷，是練到某堂課要一直捶胸部，被老師搥完一拳、站不起來非常痛。休息2天繼續練，這次又更痛，擔心肋骨裂傷。醫生說我挫傷，肋骨邊邊的深層肌肉拉傷，要休息兩個禮拜。」
當時她很害怕，但沒跟導演周美豫說到底有多痛，不希望大家擔心，「不管怎麼樣，開拍就算痛，也是要照做。」連導演老公林書宇也只好對她說「加油」，「因為連擁抱都會痛！」
黃心娣去年在拍電視劇《小女花不棄》，在搭車轉景的時候出車禍，「脊椎不能動，肋骨腫起來，復原花了半年。」接到邀約參與《女優，摔吧》讓她覺得很害怕再次受傷，「但是又很期待，因為老師、演員給我正能量，讓我突破害怕，最後都可以扛起夏于喬。」訓練讓她覺得最大的挑戰是，平日都被教育不要摔倒，「偏偏摔角就是要摔，要克服這點。站著往後倒、往後摔，人都會害怕，但一直要自摔。」
片中三位女星都有自己的摔角招式，鬼鬼的是「高空技能」，站在擂台邊纜繩的最高處，然後從高往地面摔。夏于喬則是「夾頭翻摔」，她解釋是利用纜繩的反作用力，就像《復仇者聯盟》的黑寡婦那樣，「黑寡婦用腳夾對方，轉來轉去摔出去！」黃心娣則是「炸彈飛踢」。
曹蘭、那維勳在片中扮演女子摔角運動的前輩，也少不了各種動作場面。曹蘭笑說這部片很花錢，因為請了替身演員，最後都沒用到，大家都要堅持自己來。那維勳則見證三位女星為了爬椰子樹的戲，從早到晚吊鋼絲，讓他很佩服之餘，也很慶幸自己不是女主角。


曹蘭（左）與那維勳飾演摔角運動前輩，瞬間變成「天龍地虎組」。

不過除了摔角的戲份，夏于喬跟鬼鬼還要演出「AV女優」的戲份，因為非常異想天開，連攝影師都拍到忍不住笑場。鬼鬼說：「沒有搞笑，就是認真演，但攝影師笑出來，當下覺得『因為我長的很醜嗎？』」
夏于喬則透露，有邀請老公林書宇來探班，但他沒來，所以就每天拍戲完回家報告今天做了什麼，讓他非常驚訝，「他有詢問過，『這部片到底是什麼級別？』『限制級還是輔導級？』」至於是什麼超越尺度的內容呢？夏于喬說：「因為做了不會在大眾前做的事！」
導演周美豫長年擔任林依晨的經紀人，也是電視劇的製作人，《女優，摔吧》是她首次擔任電影長片導演。她說電影的分級尺度，還在討論中。但實際拍戲下來，她很欽佩三位女星的體力都很好，「鬼鬼的運動細胞很好，有些摔角場面要被打、被揍，要演的很弱，但畫面上怎麼她看起來都不像很弱。」
張睿家在片中是一大亮點，飾演渣男，也是AV導演，算是一大突破。因為過往他都演許多高富帥的角色，但他也被戲中戲的尺度給嚇到，「比較特別是當AV導演，就在那個場合會嚇到，那個場景很寫實有男、有女。」


導演周美豫（中）提到鬼鬼（左一）運動細胞好，要演出被揍的時候，偏偏看起來怎麼都不像。

慶功宴上還播放幕後花絮，果然有許多讓人哈哈大笑的場景，像是帶有性暗示趣味的誇張場景，以及眾人在摔角場揮汗練習各種招式。除了武術指導要扛著夏于喬，演出在行進花車上轉圈的鋼管女郎，連她們的摔角教練也粉墨登場，反串對打的選手，真的是捧腹大笑。
鬼鬼說很久沒拍到捨不得的劇組，「真的每天都在笑！」殺青宴上舉辦抽獎活動，她還自掏腰包加碼跟所有工作人員同歡。《女優，摔吧》預計在2020年上映。

Xia Yuqiao, playing AV actress, wrestling, talking about the scale, scared the director
02 Nov 2019, 02:10 by Weng Jianwei, Li Zhongquan
AV actress changed the line to beat women's wrestling! ? Such a whimsical plot is the unmistakable content of the movie ""Youyou, Falling"". After a month and a half of shooting, it finally announced the killing. Xia Yuqiao, Ghosts, and Huang Xinyu have all the action scenes, and even the ""Love Action Movies"" scenes have been taken by the way. It is very curious to know what level this film wants to go.
There are a lot of wrestling scenes in the film. Of course, it is not easy. Ghosts say that the training before the filming is about 15 lessons, 3 hours for each class, and even 8 hours for several days. Because of the large amount of training before the start of the shooting, Xia Yuqiao was injured and had to take time off. ""I don't know when I was injured. I was trained to go to a class to keep my chest. I was beaten by the teacher and couldn't stand up. It was very painful. 2 I continued to practice, and this time I was even more painful and worried about rib laceration. The doctor said that I was bruised and suffered from deep muscle strain on the side of the ribs. I had to rest for two weeks.""
At that time, she was very scared, but she did not say how painful she was with the director Zhou Meiyu. I don't want everyone to worry. ""No matter what, it is painful to start shooting. It is also necessary to do it."" Even the director's husband Lin Shuyu had to say ""refueling"" to her. Because even the hug will hurt!""
Huang Xinyi was filming the TV series ""Little Girl Flowers"", and she was in a car accident when she was riding a car. ""The spine can't move, the ribs are swollen, and it takes half a year to recover."" I received an invitation to participate in ""Girls, Falling"", which made her feel very I am afraid of being hurt again. ""But I am looking forward to it. Because the teachers and actors give me positive energy, let me break through the fear, and finally I can pick up Xia Yuqiao."" The training made her feel that the biggest challenge is that she should be educated not to fall on weekdays. ""When you wrestle, you have to fall. You have to overcome this. When you stand backwards and fall backwards, people will be afraid, but they will always fall.""
The three actresses in the film have their own wrestling moves. The ghosts are ""high-altitude skills"", standing at the highest point of the cable at the side of the platform, and then falling from the ground to the ground. Xia Yuqiao is a ""clip head"", she explained that it is the reaction of the cable, just like the black widow of the Avengers League, ""the black widow clips the other side with her feet and turns to go out!"" It is ""bomb flying kick"".
Cao Lan and Na Weixun played the predecessors of the women's wrestling movement in the film, and there were also various action scenes. Cao Lanxiao said that this film is very expensive, because the actor was invited, and finally did not use it, everyone must insist on coming. Na Weixun witnessed the three actresses hanging the wire from morning till night, in order to climb the coconut tree, so that he was very admired, and he was glad that he was not the heroine.

However, in addition to the wrestling scene, Xia Yuqiao and the ghosts also performed the ""AV actress"" scene, because it was very whimsical, even the photographers couldn't help but laugh. The ghost said: ""There is no funny, it is serious, but the photographer laughs. Now I feel ""because I am very ugly?""
Xia Yuqiao revealed that she had invited her husband Lin Shuyu to visit the class, but he did not come, so he went home every day after filming and reported what he did today. He was very surprised. ""He asked, ""What is the level of this film? ""What is the limit level or the level of coaching?"" What is the content beyond the scale? Xia Yuqiao said: ""Because I did something that would not be done before the public!""
Director Zhou Meiyu has been the agent of Lin Yichen for many years and is also the producer of the TV series. ""Youyou, Falling"" is her first time as a film feature film director. She said that the grading scale of the film is still under discussion. But after the actual filming, she admired the physical strength of the three actresses. ""The ghost cell's sports cells are very good. Some wrestling scenes have to be beaten, besieged, and played very weak, but how she looks on the screen. Not as weak as it is.""
Zhang Ruijia is a highlight in the film, playing the scum man, also the AV director, is a big breakthrough. Because in the past he played many high-fashioned characters, but he was also scared by the scale of the play. ""More especially when I was an AV director, I was scared on that occasion. The scene is very realistic and has a man and a woman. ""


Director Zhou Meiyu (middle) mentioned that ghosts (left one) have good motor cells. When they want to perform a beggar, they don’t look like they are.

The celebration banquet also played behind-the-scenes footage, and there are many scenes that make people laugh, like exaggerated scenes with sexually suggestive tastes, and everyone practicing sweating in the wrestling field. In addition to the martial arts directors to take Xia Yuqiao, the performance of the steel pipe girl in the circle of the marching float, even their wrestling coaches also appeared on the stage, the players against the string, really laughed.
The ghost said that he hadn't been able to take the reluctant crew for a long time. ""I really laugh every day!"" She held a lottery at the banquet, and she also shared the weight with all the staff. ""Girls, Fall"" is expected to be released in 2020.
