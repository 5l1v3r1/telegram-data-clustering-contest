UFC 244 video: Embedded, part 5 - ‘I will show him what is exciting’
02 Nov 2019, 02:30 by Tim Burke



UFC 244 is almost here, and as usual, Embedded is here as well. The show that gives you an inside look at the marquee contestants on PPVs has issued the fifth episode for this weekend’s big show in the The Big Apple, and it serves as a brief introduction to the fighters at the top of the card.
We start off with Nate Diaz in Times Square, where he meets some fans. Some are crazier than others. He gets some food and talks about enjoying being out with the team.
Kelvin Gastelum is headed to Renzo’s. Brad Tavares makes a cameo. KG talks about hot it is in the gym, which is good for cutting weight. He’s seven pounds over (this was obviously before the whole leaning on his coaches shoulder thing earlier).
Ultimate Media Day. Corey Anderson doesn’t like the rankings. He squares off with Johnny Walker. Stephen Thompson and Vicente Luque are respectful. Gastelum talks about facing a small middleweight for once in Darren Till. Diaz believes he’s where he’s supposed to be. He’s the best fighter in the world. Before he came along, his brother was the BMF. Jorge Masvidal is very happy he’s getting the fight.
Out at JFK, Till is finally arriving after some travel issues. He says he’ll take the good with the bad as he flips off the camera. He said he’s not stressed about the issues and he’s chilled out. New York fans mob him as he gets out of the car. His coach really likes him at 185. He signs some posters and they’re good to go.
And that’s it! UFC 244 goes down tomorrow night in NYC.
