Elizabeth Warren: Laid off healthcare workers can work in auto and life insurance industries
02 Nov 2019, 02:44 by John Gage
Sen. Elizabeth Warren recommended that health insurance workers laid off by her Medicare for All plan switch over to the auto and life insurance industries.
""Where do those who work in health insurance go when private insurance is eliminated?"" a reporter asked the Massachusetts Democrat on Friday.
Warren responded by saying, ""No one gets left behind.""
She then added, ""Some of the people currently working in health insurance will work in other parts of insurance. In life insurance, in auto insurance, in car insurance.""
The comments come after Warren agreed in an Wednesday interview that her plan to eliminate private insurance options would cost the economy 2 million jobs by disrupting the healthcare industry.
The 2020 contender also released her long-awaited Medicare for All funding plan Friday, which calls for $20 trillion in taxes on employers, financial firms, giant corporations, and the top 1% of earners and is predicted to result in $59 trillion total national healthcare spending over a decade.
