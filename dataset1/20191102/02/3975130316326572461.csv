Iceland Livestreams 10-Year-Old McDonald's Cheeseburger That Won't Decompose

dryriver shares a report from the BBC: When McDonald's closed all its restaurants in Iceland in 2009, one man decided to buy his last hamburger and fries. ""I had heard that McDonald's never decompose so I just wanted to see if it was true or not,"" Hjortur Smarason told AFP. This week, it's 10 years since the seemingly indestructible meal was purchased, and it barely looks a day older. Curious observers can watch a live stream of the burger and fries from its current location in a glass cabinet in Snotra House, a hostel in southern Iceland. ""The old guy is still there, feeling quite well. It still looks quite good actually,"" the hostel's owner Siggi Sigurdur told BBC News. ""It's a fun thing, of course, but it makes you think about what you are eating. There is no mold, it's only the paper wrapping that looks old."" The hostel claims that people come from around the world to visit the burger, and the website receives up to 400,000 hits daily.
