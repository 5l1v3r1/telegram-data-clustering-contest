President Donald Trump is too busy campaigning for GOP gubernatorial candidates to attend a pair of Asia summits this weekend in suburban Bangkok.
That's according to a senior administration official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
The president is instead dispatching National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit and the East Asia summit.
The U.S. official says, ""The president and the vice president these next few days are going to be very engaged in campaigning.""
Trump was travelling to Mississippi Friday evening to campaign for GOP gubernatorial candidate Tate Reeves.
Trump is scheduled to travel to Kentucky on Monday to campaign for incumbent GOP Gov. Matt Bevin. He heads to Louisiana on Wednesday to headline a rally for Republican gubernatorial candidate Eddie Rispone.
