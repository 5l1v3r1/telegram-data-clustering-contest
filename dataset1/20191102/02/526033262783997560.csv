Fire Drill Fridays is a weekly protest organized to pressure lawmakers into taking action on preventing climate change. Fonda's fourth protest centered on promoting women's involvement in the movement.

Fonda's first arrest came on Oct. 11 after she vowed to be arrested every Friday until January to protest climate change.
""This is a crisis unlike anything that has faced humankind,"" Fonda told ABC News Deputy Political Director MaryAlice Parks. ""The reason that I'm here every Friday, with Fire Drill Fridays, is because I think every single human being has to say, 'What can I do?'
""There's only one issue that will determine the survival of our species.""
