      <p>Leonardo DiCaprio praised teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg as a “leader of our time” following their first meeting.</p>
      <p>DiCaprio, one of Hollywood’s leading stars and a prominent environmental campaigner, said 16-year-old Ms Thunberg’s message should be a “wake-up call to world leaders everywhere that the time for inaction is over”.</p>
      <p>The Academy Award-winner shared a picture of him and the Swedish student on Instagram, writing: “There are few times in human history where voices are amplified at such pivotal moments and in such transformational ways –but @GretaThunberg has become a leader of our time.</p>

      <p>“History will judge us for what we do today to help guarantee that future generations can enjoy the same livable planet that we have so clearly taken for granted.</p>
      <p>“I hope that Greta’s message is a wake-up call to world leaders everywhere that the time for inaction is over.”</p>
      <p>DiCaprio, 44, who most recently starred in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon A Time… In Hollywood, said he is “optimistic about what the future holds” thanks to Ms Thunberg and young activists like her.</p>
      <p>“It was an honour to spend time with Greta,” he added.</p>
      <p>“She and I have made a commitment to support one another, in hopes of securing a brighter future for our planet.”</p>

      <p>DiCaprio is a vocal climate change campaigner and highlighted the issue during his acceptance speech at the 88th Academy Awards in 2016.</p>
      <p>He said: “Climate change is real, it is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating.”</p>
      <p>In light of his environmental work DiCaprio, star of films including Titanic, The Revenant and The Wolf Of Wall Street, has been criticised for his use of private jets.</p>
      <p>Ms Thunberg’s activism has sparked a global strike movement that has seen millions of youngsters from across the world protest by refusing to go to school.</p>
