      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kym-marsh">Kym Marsh</a> celebrated filming her final Coronation Street scenes with a glitzy night out in Manchester on Friday.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old soap star was spotted arriving in a comfy outfit with a garment bag in hand - no doubt containing a suitably glam ensemble.</p>
      <p>Joining her at the bash were Lucy Fallon, who plays Bethany Platt, and Tina O'Brien, who portrays Sarah-Louise Platt on the cobbles.</p>
      <p>The on-screen sisters both wore elegant black dresses, paired with black heels.</p>
      <p>Lucy sported a studded off-the-shoulder dress which she paired with a Gucci handbag, while Tina wore a gorgeous sweetheart neckline number.</p>
      <p>They both made sure their make-up was on point by donning siren red lipstick.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Kym stepped out of a car in casual clothes, wearing a one shoulder baggy sweatshirt and trendy cargo trousers, which she paired with fresh white trainers.</p>
      <p>Her long brunette hair was simply put into a bun on her head, as she flashed a smile knowing she was about to join her pals.</p>
      <p>Other Corrie stars made their way to Kym's huge bash, including Jane Danson (Leanne Battersby) and Alison King (Carla Connor).</p>

      <p>Rob Mallard (Daniel Osbourne) and Jack P Shepherd (David Platt) also joined the celebrations.</p>
      <p>Corrie favourite Kym has played Michelle Connor since 2006 but she is swapping the ITV soap for the theatre.</p>
      <p>She first announced her exit from the soap in February, after 13 years of playing Michelle.</p>

      <p>Recently speaking on This Morning, Kym revealed that pal Alison has been left in tears over her decision to leave the ITV soap.</p>
      <p>The pair, who are best friends and part of the Connor family on-screen, share a dressing room - but not for much longer.</p>
      <p>On Alison's reaction to her exit, Kym said: "She's kind of fallen out with me about it. She keeps having a little cry. She's going to miss me and I'm going to miss her incredibly."</p>
