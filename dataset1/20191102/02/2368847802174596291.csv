【海外网】《纽约邮报》10月31消息称，美国和加拿大跨境石油管线棗“基石”管道（Keystone Pipeline）北达科他州段日前发生石油泄漏，38万加仑（约合1440吨）原油流出。美媒称，这是过去十年最大的陆上原油泄漏之一，也是该州规模更大的泄漏之一。俄罗斯卫星通讯社11月1日消息称，当地时间10月29日晚9点20分左右，“基石管道”运营商加拿大横加能源公司（TransCanada）检测到管道压力下降，立即关闭了位于北达科他州首府爱丁堡段的管道阀门，随后派出了应急小组前往现场。根据加拿大横加能源公司公布的事故数据，9120桶（约合383040加仑）原油泄漏，漏油量约合半个标准游泳池。受影响区域面积达2500平方米，大小相当于“一个足球场的三分之一”。管道断裂地点发生在北达科他州东北部的爱丁堡地区。据加拿大横加能源公司介绍，救援人员通过围堵的方式阻止漏油进一步扩散，并使用清理车回收原油。“挖土机和其他专门设备”也被用来协助收集渗入地下的原油。据北达科他州环境质量部门称，泄漏影响了该地区的湿地栖息地。该州水部门代表卡尔洛克曼表示，受影响湿地距离加拿大边境不到50英里，幸好不是居民饮用水来源。

After Trump ordered the withdrawal of the army, the Syrian border began with the US military patrol.

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] On Thursday, a group of US troops appeared on the Syrian-Turkish border patrol. This was the first time that US President Trump ordered the US military to withdraw its troops from Syria in early October, which caused special attention from the outside world.
On October 31, local time, US armored vehicles appeared in the border city of Qahtaniyah in northeastern Syria; then there were about 20 military vehicles with American flags hanging through the city about 30 kilometers west of Catania. Qamishli. At the same time, it was discovered that the US infantry and tank troops arrived in Deir al-Zour, which is a little farther from the Syrian-Satian border. It is expected that the US troops will continue to travel to the Northeast.
This is the first time that in early October this year, Trump ordered the US military to patrol the Syrian-Turkish border after the withdrawal of troops from the Kurdish base areas in the northeast and adjacent to the Turkish border.
A source from the Kurdish organization ""Syrian Democratic Forces"" (SDF) told the media that the US military did ""patrol"" on the border near Catania, and this is not a one-off action. The news said that when the US military patrolled, it was accompanied by the army of the Syrian Democratic Forces.
In mid-October this year, US President Trump ordered that more than 1,000 US military officers stationed in the northeastern part of Syria return to the United States. Then, 100 US military vehicles entered the territory of Iraq from the northeastern part of Syria. But Trump said last week that a small number of US troops will remain in the ""oil-rich areas"" in Syria to protect the oil fields from the remaining parties or other organizations of the Islamic State (IS).
The domestic oil wells in Syria are mainly distributed in the province of Deir ez-Zor, but a few are distributed around the areas where the US military is witnessed.
US Defense Secretary Esper also pointed out to the media that when the US troops stationed in Syria gradually withdrew from Iraq, some US troops and local allies still defended some nearby oil fields. The US Department of Defense is also discussing whether to stay behind some US troops and stationed with the Syrian Democratic Army to prevent the ""Islamic State"" elements from capturing them.
Esper said, ""We still have defenders in some cities in the north of Syria that are not far from the oil fields."" He also mentioned, ""The task they are there is to stop others, especially the ""Islamic State"" armed forces or other groups from gaining control over these fields, and have sought economic sources of their evil activities.""
