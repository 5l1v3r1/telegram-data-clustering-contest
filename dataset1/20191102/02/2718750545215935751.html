      <h1>Greta Thunberg and Leonardo DiCaprio Share Instagram Post, Concern About Earth’s Future</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T02:08:41+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 02:08</time> by <a rel="author">Charu Sinha</a></address>
      <p>Climate activist Greta Thunberg and … okay, why not, climate activist … Leonardo DiCaprio hung out, according to an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4VL7ZnFrjf/">Instagram post</a> from DiCaprio, where they are pictured bathed in golden-hour light on what appears to be a mountainside. And while the encounter may well have been just been a typical day in the life of climate superstar Thunberg — yet another in an ongoing series of <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/09/un-climate-summit-greta-thunberg-gives-her-best-speech-yet.html">high-profile moments</a> with international luminaries as she draws attention to her urgent cause — Leo, for his part, climate fanboyed out a bit.</p>
      <p>As he wrote: “There are few times in human history where voices are amplified at such pivotal moments and in such transformational ways – but <a href="https://www.instagram.com/GretaThunberg/">@GretaThunberg</a> has become a leader of our time.”</p>

      <p>He concludes the post by expressing that they have “made a commitment to support one another, in hopes of securing a brighter future for our planet.” And even if that enterprise proves to eventually be in vain, at least they have a nice photo to look back on as the Earth burns to the ground around them. </p>
