全球经济放缓 将使今明两年的油价承压

02 Nov 2019, 02:58

【路透讯】一份路透调查发现，今明两年石油价格可能承压，因全球经济增长放缓导致需求低迷，而且美国页岩油产量激增抵消了石油输出国组织(OPEC)减产、以及中东供应风险提供的支撑。受访的51位经济学家和分析师平均预测，2019和2020年布兰特原油均价分别为每桶64.16和62.38美元；上月调查时的预测分别为每桶65.19和63.56美元。今年迄今平均油价为每桶64.23美元。分析师对于今明两年美国原油的价格预估分别为每桶57.18和56.98美元，低于9月预测时的57.96和58.02美元。今年美国原油均价为56.78美元。“市场继续在供应担忧和需求担忧之间拉锯，擧amburg Commercial Bank AG的首席经济学家Cyrus de la Rubia表示。“目前，来自需求端的恐惧心理主导了局面，尽管沙特石油设施遇袭和油轮遭袭事件带来麻烦。”“油价的风险溢价已经上升，(然而)这或多或少被有关全球经济将比之前预期更显着降温的担忧所掩盖，擱ubia补充说。分析师预计2019年全球石油需求增幅将介于100万至130万桶/日，明年料介于50万至140万桶/日。“这场(贸易战)对油价构成重大拖累，没有这个因素影响，油价会要高5-10美元，”德国商业银行分析师Carsten Fritsch说。与此同时，国际能源署(IEA)表示，美国、巴西与挪威的供应增加，可能使得2020年对OPEC原油的需求减少至2900万桶/日。“明年美国页岩油产量将以接近10%的速度持续增长，我们认为，美国产量将是油价无法跟随全球经济成长出现重大反弹的主因，擮ANDA资深市场分析师Edward Moya表示。2019年美国原油产量预计将触及1226万桶/日的纪录高位。另一方面，部分分析师表示，未来几个月原油需求可能获得提振，因部分航运业者改用更清洁的船用燃料，以符合国际海事组织(International Maritime Organization)的新规定。

The global economic slowdown will put pressure on oil prices this year and next

02 Nov 2019, 02:58

[Reuters] A Reuters poll found that oil prices may be under pressure this year and next, due to the slowdown in global economic growth, and the sharp increase in US shale oil production offset the OPEC production cuts and Middle East supply. Support for risk. The average of 51 economists and analysts interviewed predicted that the average price of Brent crude oil in 2019 and 2020 was 64.16 and 62.38 US dollars per barrel respectively; the forecast for last month's survey was 65.19 and 63.56 US dollars per barrel respectively. The average oil price so far this year is $64.23 a barrel. Analysts' estimates for US crude oil this year and next are $57.18 and $56.98, respectively, down from 57.96 and $58.02 in September. The average US crude oil price this year is $56.78. “The market continues to rive between supply concerns and demand concerns,” said Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at amburg Commercial Bank AG. “At present, fear from the demand side dominates the situation, despite the attack on Saudi oil facilities and the tanker The attack brought trouble. ""The risk premium for oil prices has risen, (however) this is more or less overshadowed by fears that the global economy will cool more significantly than previously expected,"" added Ruba. Analysts expect global oil demand growth to be between 1 million and 1.3 million barrels per day in 2019 and between 500,000 and 1.4 million barrels per day next year. ""This (trade war) has a major drag on oil prices. Without this factor, oil prices will be as high as $5-10,"" said German Commercial Bank analyst Carsten Fritsch. At the same time, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said that increased supply in the United States, Brazil and Norway could reduce the demand for OPEC crude oil to 29 million barrels per day in 2020. ""Next year, US shale oil production will continue to grow at a rate close to 10%. We believe that US production will be the main reason why oil prices cannot follow the global economic growth,"" said Andrew Moya, senior market analyst at ANDA. 2019 US crude oil Production is expected to hit a record high of 12.26 million barrels per day. On the other hand, some analysts said that demand for crude oil may be boosted in the coming months as some shipping operators switch to cleaner marine fuels to comply with the International Maritime Organization. (New Maritime Organization) new regulations.
