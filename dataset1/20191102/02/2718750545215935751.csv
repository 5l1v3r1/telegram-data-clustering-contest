Greta Thunberg and Leonardo DiCaprio Share Instagram Post, Concern About Earth’s Future
02 Nov 2019, 02:08 by Charu Sinha
Climate activist Greta Thunberg and … okay, why not, climate activist … Leonardo DiCaprio hung out, according to an Instagram post from DiCaprio, where they are pictured bathed in golden-hour light on what appears to be a mountainside. And while the encounter may well have been just been a typical day in the life of climate superstar Thunberg — yet another in an ongoing series of high-profile moments with international luminaries as she draws attention to her urgent cause — Leo, for his part, climate fanboyed out a bit.
As he wrote: “There are few times in human history where voices are amplified at such pivotal moments and in such transformational ways – but @GretaThunberg has become a leader of our time.”



He concludes the post by expressing that they have “made a commitment to support one another, in hopes of securing a brighter future for our planet.” And even if that enterprise proves to eventually be in vain, at least they have a nice photo to look back on as the Earth burns to the ground around them.
