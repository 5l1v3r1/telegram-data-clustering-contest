納瓦羅：三階段解決中共「7宗罪惡」

02 Nov 2019, 04:12

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】美中貿易談判正在朝第一階段協議邁進，白宮貿易顧問納瓦羅（Peter Navarro）日前表示，即便第一階段協議進行順利，還須另外兩個階段，才能將中共的結構性「7宗罪惡」徹底解決。
美中官方11月1日一致表示談判進展良好，正逐步向達成第一階段協議邁進。川普對此表示滿意，計劃與習近平會面簽署協議。
2日，他在白宮表示，「我們正在尋找幾個地點，甚至可能在愛荷華州」。
不過，白宮貿易顧問納瓦羅對《路透社》表示，即便第一階段協議進行順利，還須看另外兩個階段的成果。美國需要分三個階段，才能徹底解決中共的7個結構性罪惡。
他表示，協議的關鍵在於，美國可對中共任何違約情況強制施加關稅，且無懼中共的報復行動。
8月，納瓦羅曾在「福克斯新聞週日」節目中接受採訪，他歷數中共在對美貿易中的種種不公平做法，稱中共犯下「七宗罪」（Seven Deadly Sins)：包括盜竊知識產權，強迫技術轉讓，網路黑客入侵，對美國市場傾銷商品和讓美國公司倒閉，大力補貼國營企業，出口毒品芬太尼，操縱貨幣。
他強調說，中共必須停止這些不當行為，美中貿易戰才會結束。
白宮首席經濟顧問拉里‧庫德洛（Larry Kudlow）9月曾表示：「我們想回到5月（談判到達）的地方，但我不知道這是否可行，我不想預測任何結果。這是一件困難的事情。」
他還說，中共改革必須反映在修改法律上，任何協議都必須有執行條款，以確保中方履行其承諾。
時事評論員周曉輝在大紀元撰文稱，就在中美新一輪貿易談判後不久，中共就在購買美國農產品問題上一再反悔，並要求美國取消加征關稅，且強烈抨擊彭斯副總統的演講，更為重要的是，中共在四中全會的公報中，再次釋放了繼續堅持走邪路、死路，拒絕擁抱普世價值的信號，凡此種種，都讓中美貿易談判達成協議難以樂觀。

Navarro: Three stages to solve the ""seven evils"" of the CCP

02 Nov 2019, 04:12

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] The US-China trade negotiations are moving toward the first phase of the agreement. White House trade consultant Peter Navarro said recently that even if the first phase of the agreement goes smoothly, two more At the stage, the structural ""seven sins"" of the CCP can be completely resolved.
The US-China official unanimously stated on November 1 that the negotiations are progressing well and are gradually moving towards reaching the first phase of the agreement. Trump expressed satisfaction with this and planned to meet with Xi Jinping to sign an agreement.
On the 2nd, he said at the White House, ""We are looking for a few locations, maybe even in Iowa.""
However, the White House trade adviser Navarro told Reuters that even if the first phase of the agreement goes smoothly, it must look at the results of the other two phases. The United States needs three stages to completely resolve the seven structural evils of the CCP.
He said that the key to the agreement is that the United States can impose tariffs on any breach of contract by the CCP and is not afraid of CCP's retaliatory actions.
In August, Navarro was interviewed on the ""Fox News Sunday"" program. He recorded the CCP's unfair practices in trade with the United States, saying that the CCP had committed ""Seven Deadly Sins"": including theft of intellectual property rights. Forced technology transfer, online hacking, dumping of goods on the US market and the closure of US companies, heavily subsidizing state-owned enterprises, exporting drugs to fentanyl, and manipulating currency.
He stressed that the CCP must stop these misconducts and the US-China trade war will end.
Larry Kudlow, White House's chief economic adviser, said in September: ""We want to go back to May (negotiations arrived), but I don't know if this works, I don't want to predict any results. This is a A difficult thing.""
He also said that the reform of the CCP must be reflected in the revision of the law, and any agreement must have an enforcement clause to ensure that China fulfills its commitments.
Current affairs commentator Zhou Xiaohui wrote in the Epoch Times that shortly after the new round of trade negotiations between China and the United States, the CCP repeatedly repented on the issue of purchasing American agricultural products, and asked the United States to cancel the tariff increase, and strongly criticized Vice President Burns’s speech. More importantly, in the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session, the CCP once again released the signal of continuing to follow the path of evil, dying, and refusing to embrace universal values. All of these have made it difficult to agree on an agreement on Sino-US trade negotiations.
