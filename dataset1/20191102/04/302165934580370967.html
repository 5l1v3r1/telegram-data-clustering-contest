      <p>LONDON, Nov 2 — Jennifer Aniston returns to television yesterday in <i>The Morning Show</i>, an original show for Apple Inc’s new subscription video service, in which the actress reunites with her <i>Friends</i> sister Reese Witherspoon.</p>
      <p>In the 10-episode programme, Aniston plays a well-known television journalist on a fictional morning programme whose male co-presenter, played by Steve Carell, has been fired amid sexual harassment accusations.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old actress, who rose to global stardom through <i>Friends</i>, starred in a string of movies after the hit 1994-2004 series ended, including <i>Horrible Bosses</i>, <i>The Break-Up</i> and <i>Marley &amp; Me</i> on top of a few cameos on television shows.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t really about TV versus film,” Aniston told reporters at a London screening of <i>The Morning Show</i> about taking on a television starring role.</p>
      <p>“It was really the show... I love morning talk shows and getting to learn about the world behind it is just fascinating ... It was the most rewarding thing I’ve done in years.”</p>
      <p><i>The Morning Show</i> looks at issues highlighted by the #MeToo movement — which has drawn attention to sexual harassment and abuse of women in the fields of entertainment, business and politics — as well as ageism.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t necessarily felt that ageism has affected me only because I feel like I’m working more than I’ve ever worked,” Aniston said.</p>
      <p>“The #MeToo of it all, we’re all kind of trying to find our way and understand this new normal. And I think the show does a really good job of shedding a light on that.”</p>
      <p>Oscar winner Witherspoon, who played Aniston’s sister on <i>Friends</i>, portrays a young reporter. Both actresses were also executive producers on <i>The Morning Show</i>.</p>
      <p>“It’s different now. We have a lot more experience. We have a lot more wisdom. We’ve learned a lot,” Witherspoon told reporters on working with Aniston again. “And we feel we’ve learnt the stories we want to tell.”</p>
      <p>Apple TV+ launched yesterday.</p>
      <p>Asked how a series can stand out when streaming services are regularly launching original content, executive producer Michael Ellenberg said: “Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell — is probably the simplest thing.”</p>
      <p>“And then it was an amazing opportunity to be part of Apple’s launch ... it’s a company that knows how to create a moment when the iPhone comes out, you know it’s coming out. And I think everyone knows our show is coming out right now too.” — Reuters</p>
