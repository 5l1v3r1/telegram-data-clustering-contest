      <p>Spencer Moe had two goals and an assist on Friday night, leading the Prince Albert Raiders to a 6-3 comeback win over the visiting Regina Pats.</p>
      <p>It was the third straight win for the defending WHL champions (10-2-3-0), who prevailed before 2,703 fans at the Art Hauser Centre.</p>
      <p>Logan Nijhoff had two goals in a losing cause for the Pats (2-11-1-0), whose modest two-game points streak came to an end.</p>
      <p>After a scoreless first period, Moe buried his first of the night 1:32 into the second. Drew Englot (first WHL goal) and Nijhoff responded to give Regina a 2-1 lead after 40 minutes, but the Raiders scored four straight in the third (Ozzy Wiesblatt, Reece Vitelli, Aliaksei Protas and Brayden Watts) to open up a 5-2 lead.</p>
      <p>Nijhoff added his second of the night with 2:27 left in regulation before Moe rounded out the scoring 32 seconds later into an empty net.</p>
      <p>Max Paddock made 35 saves for the Pats, who were outshot 16-7 in the third and 41-26 overall.</p>
      <p>Raiders netminder Boston Bilous picked up the win.</p>
      <p><b>EXTRAS</b>: F Caiden Daley, acquired Tuesday from Brandon, notched one assist in his Pats debut … Protas had a goal and two assists while Ilya Usau added three helpers … Prince Albert went 2-for-4 on the power play. Regina was 0-for-3 … The Pats are back on home ice Sunday (4 p.m.) against the Red Deer Rebels.</p>
