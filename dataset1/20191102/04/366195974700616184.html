      <p>There are artists who wait for specific album cycle rollouts before releasing new music, and then there's <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/KidInk/profile">Kid Ink</a>. The rapper makes sure to deliver quality sounds to fans on a regular basis, whether or not he has a full project in play. <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/kid-ink-details-his-vacation-on-his-single-miami-new-song.1984489.html">He promised fans that he'd do his best at dropping new music</a> weekly, and for the most part, he's made good on his word.</p>
      <p>This week's installment came by way of his new single "Rich," an almost two-minute track where he spits bars about his economic status. While some artists have a tendency to release music that sounds much like other tracks they've shared in the past, Kid Ink is able to drop a good mix of tunes without sounding repetitive. Check out "Rich" and let us know if you're feeling it.</p>
