预算案风波持续发酵 两名雅京特区局长向阿尼斯递交辞职信

02 Nov 2019, 04:09

【雅加达点滴新闻网】一石激起千层浪。引发舆论纷纷的雅京特区政府2020年预算案风波持续发酵。不仅预算金额匪夷所思，雅京特区相关部门对预算案的透明度也不公开。雅京特区省长阿尼斯（Anies Baswedan）成为舆论的焦点。或许受到社会舆论压力，两名雅京特区高层已向阿尼斯省长提交辞呈信。继教育文化处主任Edy Junaedi已向阿尼斯省长递交辞呈申请后，雅京特区地方发展规划（Bappeda）主任Sri Mahendra于昨日也决定辞职。两名雅京高等同时提交辞职信，不仅震撼雅京特区省长阿尼斯，亦成为社会大众舆论的焦点，并让民众不禁联想佐科威和钟万学（BTP）领导雅京特区采用电子预算(E-budgeting)编制预算案的透明度，民众也随时随地可以上网监控收支预算的明细。然而，阿尼斯反而指责佐科威和钟万学使用的电子预算系统不够智能。钟万学近日也在媒体讽刺阿尼斯，不是电子预算系统不智能，而是阿尼斯“超级聪明”（over smart）了！众所周知，雅京特区2020年预算案中，既然编制50亿盾给据悉具有影响力的人士，花737亿盾大笔预算修建自行车道，编制828亿盾采购Aibon胶，编制1240亿盾购买圆珠笔和预备1210亿盾采购电脑。而Sri Mahendra却辩护说这些数字仅是暂时输入数据，胡言乱语说这些不是实际数据。

The budget storm continued to ferment. Two Yajing SAR directors submitted their resignation letters to Anis

02 Nov 2019, 04:09

[Jakarta News] A stone provokes a thousand waves. The 2020 budget of the Yajing SAR government, which has caused public opinion, continues to ferment. Not only is the budget amount ridiculous, but the relevant departments of the Yajing Special Zone are not open to the transparency of the budget. The Governor of the Yajing Special Zone, Anies Baswedan, became the focus of public opinion. Perhaps under pressure from public opinion, two senior officials of the Yajing Special Administrative Region have submitted a letter of resignation to Governor Anis. Following the submission of the resignation by Edy Junaedi, Director of the Department of Education and Culture, Sri Mahendra, Director of the Local Development Plan (Bappeda) of the Yajing Special Zone, decided to resign yesterday. The two Yajing High Schools submitted their resignation letters at the same time, which not only shocked the Governor of the Yajing Special Zone, Anis, but also became the focus of public opinion, and made the people think that Zokowei and Zhong Wanxue (BTP) led the Yajing Special Zone to adopt the electronic budget (E -budgeting) The transparency of the budget is prepared, and the public can monitor the details of the revenue and expenditure budget online at any time and anywhere. However, Anis instead accused the electronic budget system used by Jokowi and Zhong Wanxue not smart enough. Zhong Wanxue also satirized Anis in the media recently. It is not that the electronic budget system is not smart, but that Anis is ""over smart""! As is known to all, in the 2020 Budget of the Yajing Special Zone, since the preparation of 5 billion rupiah for those who are known to have influence, spend 73.7 billion rupiah to build bicycle lanes, prepare 82.8 billion rupiah to purchase Aibon glue, and prepare 124 billion dongs to buy ballpoint pens. Prepare 12 billion shields to purchase computers. Sri Mahendra argued that these numbers are only temporary input data, and nonsense that these are not actual data.
