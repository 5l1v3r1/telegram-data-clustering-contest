      <p>Puppies grow up so fast: yesterday you watched a little clumsy pooch taking its first steps and today your little pupster is already a stunning grown-upÂ  dog that can take care of itself. Parents of this beautiful girl from the video put a lot of effort into her upbringing. Now, the doggo is absolutely independent as it can go for a walk herself, not waiting for anybody.</p>
