02 Nov 2019, 04:08 by 黃揚明
總統蔡英文、前行政院長賴清德今（2日）上午在台南參加民進黨立委林俊憲的競選總部成立大會，這也是2人在總統初選後首次公開合體同框，蔡賴二人牽著手在舞台上高喊凍蒜，蔡也特別點名感謝賴赴美演講、助選。
不過，對外界關注的「蔡賴配」議題，蔡英文受訪時仍重申：「還是那句話嘛！我們很團結，我們會在最適當的機會提出最佳的組合。」不過，她也表示，和賴清德「並肩作戰的感覺很好啊！」
蔡英文強調，民進黨很團結，也有共識要集結最大力量，希望藉由民進黨的團結，集合社會上更多支持力量，在這次選舉讓台灣人的意志做最大的展現，爭取總統勝選、國會過半。有記者追問「蔡賴配」算團結嗎？蔡說：「不用算不算，我們現在就很團結了。」
有記者問賴清德對「蔡賴配」的看法，在蔡英文身旁的賴清德僅說：「這是總統的記者會。」蔡英文接著說：「你這樣子功力不錯喔！」蔡賴攜手合照時，有記者問蔡未來與賴會不會時常合體？蔡笑說：「這是不用問的問題。」
蔡英文車隊今10時21分抵達林俊憲競總成立會場，賴清德前往迎接，二人握手打招呼後，賴便跟在小英身後一同步上舞台，賴站在蔡英文身旁，兩人攜手並高舉雙手高喊「凍蒜」。


賴清德返台後開啟助選模式，今日合體蔡英文替林俊憲造勢。

蔡英文演講時，開場就回過頭看著賴清德說：「很高興今天看到賴清德前院長一起給我們支持。」賴則點頭回應。蔡強調，距離選舉還有70天，大家要一起拚，「蔡英文一定拚，大家作伙拚，我們總統要過關、國會要過半！」
蔡英文說，台南過去在賴清德等縣市長共同打拚下，讓台南越來越進步，生活品質越來越好，希望全台灣所有人都可以到台南走走看看，年輕人可以落地生根。談到林俊憲爭取成大老人醫院時，蔡也點名這是賴清德擔任市長時就規劃，擔任院長時執行的政績。提到林俊憲，蔡還特別提及，2012年她選總統時的「三隻小豬」，發想人就是林，所以一定要讓他高票連任。
談到執政成果，蔡英文說，前面3年很辛苦，因為要改革、打基礎，歷任3位行政院長都很打拚，「有一位今天站在這邊（指賴清德），也給他掌聲好不好！」蔡說，雖然國際經濟有很多不確定因素，台灣經濟穩穩地往前走、穩穩成長，今年前三季經濟成長率都是亞洲四小龍第1名。
蔡英文也提及主權議題，強調這3年多來，中國對台灣打壓、文攻武嚇從來沒斷過，但政府從來沒退讓過，要繼續團結、打拚，來守護主權，讓台灣民主代代相傳，「有主權，才有民主自由，沒有主權，就沒辦法保證民主自由。」
對賴清德上月赴美輔選，蔡英文特別提及並表達感謝之意，她說，希望團結、集結所有力量，為台灣人打一個很好的選戰，所以她很感謝賴去美國演講、溝通，希望海外鄉親團結，而且賴從美國回來沒時間休息，還要全台灣輔選，讓輔選可達到最大力道，「跟賴院長說聲多謝，好不好！」
蔡英文結束演說後，再次與賴清德攜手高喊凍蒜口號。隨後前往林俊憲競總內接受媒體訪問，賴清德也全程緊跟在旁。
賴清德為林俊憲站台時說，他今天看到很多多年來栽培他的好朋友，熱情就像台南的太陽一樣非常溫暖。他強調，今天不但蔡總統來到台南，國民黨的總統候選人韓國瑜也來到台南，這是2020年選戰第一場車拚場面，表示看得起台南，一定要和台灣社會說，台南的民主招牌要堅持下去。
賴清德強調，2008年民進黨最艱困的時刻，區域立委僅當選13席，但5席台南立委都當選，2012、2016立委選戰台南立委也都全壘打，除了全力支持林俊憲，其他5席都要打出全壘打，台南6席是基礎，基礎打穩，讓蔡總統一定連任，國會也能過半。
此外，賴清德也說，過去從陳水扁、謝長廷到蔡英文，歷次總統選舉民進黨在台南的得票率都是全國最高，現在台灣情勢非常危急，尤其中國國家主席習近平年初說台灣只有香港、澳門的「一國兩制」模式，我們要拒絕台灣成為第2個香港，這場選戰府城鄉親一定要站在第一線、打頭陣。
賴清德抵達會場時受訪表示，今天對台南或整個大選都非常重要，因為不僅總統蔡英文到台南，韓國瑜也到台南，他懇請台南父老鄉親一定要站穩民主陣線，不僅讓林俊憲高票當選，民進黨提名的6席立委候選人也要全壘打，還要維持過去民進黨總統候選人在台南得票率最高的傳統，這樣不但蔡英文可以當選，國會也可以過半。
不過，被問到「蔡賴配」議題，賴清德僅說「謝謝」，並未多談，僅表示他一直都在民進黨、台灣隊行列，所以支持蔡英文、輔選立委都是他的責任。他也說，林俊憲的選區也是他以前擔任立委時經營的選區，今天和許多老朋友見面非常高興。蔡英文與賴清德明天還將一同前往高雄，為民進黨立委李昆澤輔選。

02 Nov 2019, 04:08 by Huang Yangming
President Tsai Ing-wen and former Executive Dean Lai Qingde attended the inaugural meeting of the Democratic Progressive Party legislator Lin Junxian in Tainan this morning (2nd). This is the first time that two people have joined the same box after the presidential primary election. I started to shout at the stage on the frozen garlic. Cai also named the Lai to the United States to give a speech and help.
However, on the issue of ""Cai Lai Fu"", which was of concern to the outside world, Tsai Ing-wen reiterated during his interview: ""It is still the same sentence! We are very united and we will propose the best combination at the most appropriate opportunity."" However, she also It’s said that it’s good to work side by side with Lai Qingde!
Tsai Ing-wen stressed that the DPP is very united and has the consensus to gather the greatest strength. It is hoped that with the unity of the DPP and more supportive forces in the society, the will of the Taiwanese will be maximized in this election, and the president will win. Election, more than half of the Congress. Is there a reporter who asks ""Cai Lai"" to be united? Cai said: ""No need to count, we are very united now.""
A reporter asked Lai Qingde's views on ""Cai Lai Fu"". Lai Qingde, who is next to Tsai Ing-wen, said only: ""This is the president's press conference."" Tsai Ing-wen continued: ""You are doing a good job!"" At the time, a reporter asked if Cai future and Lai would not fit together? Cai Xiao said: ""This is a question that you don't have to ask.""
Tsai Ing-wen’s team arrived at Lin Junxian’s general meeting at 10:21 this morning. Lai Qingde went to meet. After the two men shook hands and said hello, Lai followed the stage of Xiaoying’s body and was on the stage. Lai stood beside Tsai Ing-wen and the two joined hands. Raise your hands and shout ""Frozen Garlic"".


After Lai Qingde returned to Taiwan, he opened the mode of assisting the selection. Today, Tsai Tsai in English made a move for Lin Junxian.

When Tsai Ing-wen gave a speech, he turned around and looked at Lai Qingde. ""I am very pleased to see the former Dean of Lai Qingde to support us today."" Lai nodded and responded. Cai stressed that there are still 70 days from the election. Everyone has to fight together. ""Tsai Ing-wen must fight, everyone will fight, our president will cross the border, and the Congress will be over half!""
Tsai Ing-wen said that Tainan used to work together with the mayors of Lai Qingde and other counties to make Tainan more and more progressive, and the quality of life is getting better and better. I hope that all people in Taiwan can go to Tainan to take a look and see, young people can take root. When talking about Lin Junxian's struggle for becoming a large elderly hospital, Cai also named it. This is the performance of Lai Qingde when he was the mayor. Referring to Lin Junxian, Cai also mentioned that the ""three little pigs"" when she elected the president in 2012, the person who thought it was Lin, so he must be re-elected.
When talking about the outcome of the ruling, Tsai Ing-wen said that the previous three years have been very hard. Because of reforms and basics, the three executive deans have been working hard. ""There is one who stands here today (referring to Lai Qingde) and gives him applause. Cai said that although the international economy has many uncertainties, Taiwan's economy has steadily moved forward and grew steadily. The economic growth rate in the first three quarters of this year was the first among the four Asian dragons.
Tsai Ing-wen also mentioned the issue of sovereignty. He stressed that over the past three years or so, China has never broken the crackdown on Taiwan and the attack on the literary attack. However, the government has never resigned, and must continue to unite and fight to protect sovereignty and make Taiwan democratic. According to legend, ""With sovereignty, there is democracy and freedom. Without sovereignty, there is no way to guarantee democracy and freedom.""
Regarding Lai Qingde’s visit to the United States last month, Tsai Ing-wen specifically mentioned and expressed her gratitude. She said that she hopes to unite and assemble all the forces and play a good campaign for the Taiwanese. Therefore, she is very grateful to Lai’s speech in the United States. Communicate, I hope that overseas folks will unite, and they will not have time to rest after coming back from the United States. They will also have to assist in Taiwan’s secondary elections so that the auxiliary elections can reach their maximum strength. ""Thank you, Dean, thank you, good!""
After Tsai Ing-wen’s speech, he and Lai Qingde once again shouted the slogan of frozen garlic. Afterwards, he went to Lin Junxian to accept media interviews, and Lai Qingde also followed the whole process.
Lai Qingde said that when Lin Junxian stood on the platform, he saw many good friends who had cultivated him for many years. The enthusiasm was as warm as the sun in Tainan. He stressed that today, not only President Cai came to Tainan, but also the KMT’s presidential candidate, Yuki Yu, came to Tainan. This is the first scene of the 2020 battle. He said that he can afford to see Taiwanese and Taiwanese society. The signboard must be continued.
Lai Qingde emphasized that at the most difficult time of the DPP in 2008, the regional legislators were only elected to 13 seats, but the five Tainan legislators were elected. The 2012 and 2016 legislators chose the Tainan legislators to also run home, in addition to full support. Lin Junxian, the other five seats will have to run a home run. The six seats in Tainan are the foundation, the foundation is stabilized, and President Cai will be re-elected. Congress can also be halfway through.
In addition, Lai Qingde also said that in the past, from Chen Shui-bian, Xie Changting to Tsai Ing-wen, the votes of the DPP in Tainan were the highest in the country. Now the situation in Taiwan is very critical. In particular, Chinese President Xi Jinping said at the beginning of Taiwan that there are only Hong Kong and Macao. In the ""one country, two systems"" model, we must refuse Taiwan to become the second Hong Kong. The urban and rural parents of this election must stand on the front line and take the lead.
When Lai Qingde arrived at the venue, he said that today is very important for Tainan or the entire election, because not only President Tsai Ing-wen goes to Tainan, but also South Korea Yu to Tainan. He urges the Tainan folks to stand firm and democratic front, not only to let Lin Junxian vote On the election, the candidates for the six-member legislators nominated by the DPP must also run home. They must also maintain the tradition of the DPP presidential candidate with the highest vote rate in Tainan. This way, not only can Tsai Ing-wen be elected, but Congress can also be over half.
However, when asked about the topic of ""Cai Lai Fu"", Lai Qingde only said ""thank you"". He did not talk much. He only said that he has always been in the ranks of the Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwanese team. Therefore, he supports Tsai Ing-wen and the auxiliary legislators. Responsibility. He also said that Lin Junxian's constituency was also the constituency he had run when he was a legislator. It is very happy to meet many old friends today. Tsai Ing-wen and Lai Qing-de will also go to Kaohsiung tomorrow to be selected by Li Kunze, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party.
