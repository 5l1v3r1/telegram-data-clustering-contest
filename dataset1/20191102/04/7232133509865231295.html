      <p>Since topping at $10,500 last week, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/category/crypto/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) has been in a relative state of calm, trading within a tight range between $9,000 and $9,500. Despite this consolidation above the 200-day moving average, which many analysts would call more bullish than bearish, some fear that the crypto market’s charts are flashing warning signs. They claim that a decline from here is likely.</p>

      <h3>Bitcoin Flashes Warning Signs </h3>
      <p>An analyst going by James recently drew attention to an array of reasons why it may be logical to be bearish on Bitcoin. He noted that BTC’s three-day Relative Strength Index remains in “bear market” territory, while the recent move higher was a textbook signal for a trend continuation. He added that there also exists two hidden bearish divergences on the one-day chart, implying a further breakdown.</p>

      <p>Dave the Wave has corroborated this sentiment. He noted that the Histogram has begun to contract on the daily, while the one-day Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has started to roll over. This implies that the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/24/bitcoin-price-bottom-mid-november-6500-analysis/">medium-term trend is “down.”  </a></p>

      <h3>Bull Case Slowly Building</h3>
      <p>While Bitcoin may soon be susceptible to a short-term drop, one that may bring it back to the $7,000 range, the case for a long-term bullish trend is starting to be realized yet again.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/31/bitcoin-see-collosal-golden-cross-2019-precede-price-boom/">reported by this very outlet previously</a>, popular analyst <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/?s=Filb+Filb&amp;lang=en">Filb Filb</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/filbfilb/status/1189468169896894464">noted</a> that by the end of November or start of December, the 50-week and 100-week moving averages will see a “golden cross,” which he claims is far more significant” for the Bitcoin market that other technical crosses.</p>
      <p>Filb’s chart depicts that after the last time the 50-week crossed above the 100-week, Bitcoin rallied for months straight, surging to fresh highs month in, month out. Historical precedence would suggest the same is about to happen… again.</p>
      <p>Also, trader HornHairs has noted that he “likes the chance we hit $14,000 before $7,000.” But why, exactly, does the trader expect Bitcoin to surge higher by 55% from the current price of $9,200 over the alternative scenario of a collapse to $7,000.</p>
      <p>Well, it has much to do with where Bitcoin has just bounced from and where it closed October. He remarked in a recent tweet that with Bitcoin bouncing strong and holding above the one-month bullish breaker, the 0.618 Fibonacci Retracement of the entire cycle, the Point of Control as defined by the volume profile, and the yearly pivot, BTC is leaning rather bullish.</p>
