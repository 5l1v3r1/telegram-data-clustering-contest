02 Nov 2019, 04:25 by 楊政勳, 楊政勳

2019暴雪嘉年華（BlizzCon）於台北時間11月2日凌晨正式登場，由於上月發生「聰哥事件」，讓部分人聚集在BlizzCon會場外表達抗議，更有一名年輕女子穿著小熊維尼的服裝，還在上衣寫著「FIGHT FOR FREEDOM，STAND WITH HONGKONG」（為自由而戰，與香港站在一起）的字樣。

暴雪嘉年華開幕前，已有人聚集在場外發送抗議T恤 ，並高舉「FREE HONG KONG；EVERY VOICE MATTERS」（自由香港；每個聲音都很重要）的旗幟，抗議人群與守在入口處的暴雪工作人員僅距離幾公尺，但過程算是相當平和。


BlizzCon會場外，有團體因為上月的「聰哥事件」發起抗議活動。

抗議者發送的宣傳單上寫著，「我們不是要遺棄暴雪，而是要幫助暴雪趕緊回頭。」強調暴雪10月對於聰哥的處置，讓他們感覺到暴雪把中國市場放在言論自由前面，因此要讓抗議T恤穿梭在BlizzCon會場，以喚醒暴雪的初衷，並在文末寫上暴雪三大核心價值「EVERY VOICE MATTERS」（每個聲音都很重要）、「LEAD RESPONSIBLY」（領導責任）、「THINK GLOBALLY」（放眼全球）。


以小美為圖樣的抗議T桖。

一直聲援反送中的團體「Freedom Hong Kong」則將《鬥陣特攻》裡的小美化身為伸援香港抗爭者的角色，製作成「MEI WITH HONG KONG」的T 恤發送；也有不少人穿著維尼裝，大辣辣地在場內外遊走，來表達心中不滿。


不少人打扮成維尼裝抗議。

場外在抗議，場內暴雪總裁J. Allen Brack在開幕式時也對「聰哥事件」道歉，坦承當時的決策速度太快，且太慢跟玩家溝通，他也願意接受指責。
「聰哥事件」是指上個月香港選手「聰哥」blitzchung在《爐石戰記》大師職業賽賽後，帶著護目鏡與防毒面罩受訪，並大喊「光復香港，時代革命」，事後暴雪火速對他祭出懲處，包括從大師職業賽除名、取消賽季獎金、禁賽一年，連兩位賽評都遭中止合作。消息一出引發玩家怒火，認為暴雪為了中國市場不顧言論自由，後來暴雪雖然減輕懲處，仍有不少玩家揚言抵制暴雪。

[Fighting the Blizzard Carnival] The incident of the Congge incident is extended. The protesters wear the Pooh to support Hong Kong.

2019 Blizzcon (BlizzCon) officially debuted in the early morning of November 2nd, Taipei time. Due to the ""Congge incident"" last month, some people gathered outside BlizzCon to express their protests. Another young woman wore Winnie the Pooh costume. In the blouse, the words ""FIGHT FOR FREEDOM, STAND WITH HONGKONG"" (for freedom and stand with Hong Kong) are written.

Before the opening of the Blizzcon Carnival, people gathered outside the venue to send protest T-shirts and held high the banner of ""FREE HONG KONG; EVERY VOICE MATTERS"" (free Hong Kong; every voice is important), protesting against the crowd and the Blizzard work at the entrance. The staff is only a few meters away, but the process is quite peaceful.


Outside the BlizzCon meeting, a group launched a protest because of the ""Cong Ge Incident"" last month.

The flyer sent by the protesters said, ""We are not going to abandon Blizzard, but to help Blizzard hurry back."" Emphasizing Blizzard’s handling of Congge in October, letting them feel that Blizzard has placed the Chinese market in front of freedom of speech. Therefore, the protest T-shirts should be shuttled to the BlizzCon venue to awaken the original intention of Blizzard, and at the end of the text, the three core values of Blizzard ""EVERY VOICE MATTERS"" (each sound is very important), ""LEAD RESPONSIBLY"" (leadership responsibility), ""THINK GLOBALLY"" (see the world).


Protesting against the beauty of Xiaomei.

The group ""Freedom Hong Kong"", which has been supporting the anti-delivery, has turned ""Little Fighting"" in ""Double Attack"" into a role as a protester of Hong Kong and made a T-shirt for ""MEI WITH HONG KONG"". There are also many people. Dressed in a Pooh dress, he sneaked around on and off the court to express his dissatisfaction.


Many people dressed up as Pooh to protest.

Off-site protests, Blizzard President J. Allen Brack also apologized to the ""Cong Ge Incident"" at the opening ceremony, confessing that the decision-making speed was too fast and too slow to communicate with the players, he is also willing to accept accusations.
""Cong Ge Incident"" means that last month Hong Kong player ""Cong Ge"" blitzchung was interviewed with goggles and anti-virus mask after the ""Golden Wars"" master professional competition, and shouted ""Recovering Hong Kong, the era revolution"". After the event, Blizzard quickly punish him, including the removal of the master professional game, the cancellation of the season bonus, a one-year ban, and even the two competitions were suspended. When the news came out, the player was angry and thought that Blizzard had ignored the freedom of speech for the Chinese market. Later, although Blizzard reduced the punishment, many players still threatened to boycott Blizzard.
