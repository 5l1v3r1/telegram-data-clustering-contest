      <h1>Families losing loved ones abroad should not be failed by the Foreign Office</h1>
      <h2>A parliamentary report reveals how badly let down families have felt at the inaction of the FCO.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T04:30:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Record View, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/record-view/</a></address>
      <p>Families across the country will have experienced the heartbreak of losing a loved one.</p>
      <p>However, it is every family’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-families-whove-suffered-deaths-20791604">nightmare</a> losing someone abroad and having to deal with overseas authorities.</p>
      <p>When tragedy strikes, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-families-whove-suffered-deaths-20791604">UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> should do as much as they can to assist.</p>
      <p>A parliamentary report reveals how badly let down families have felt at the inaction of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-families-whove-suffered-deaths-20791604">FCO</a>.</p>
      <p>An all-party group at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-families-whove-suffered-deaths-20791604">Westminster</a> spoke to 60 families, including from Scotland, whose loved ones had gone missing, been imprisoned or died abroad. Their testimony should shame the FCO.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>SNP MSP Clare Haughey and her husband Paul lost their son Charlie while he was in Holland in July. Paul said the FCO had been “worse than useless”.</p>
      <p>Julie Love’s son <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-families-whove-suffered-deaths-20791604">Colin</a> drowned in Venezuela in 2009. She says she called the FCO and never got a call back.</p>
      <p>The recommendations are excellent, including a call for experienced <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-families-whove-suffered-deaths-20791604">FCO</a> staff to meet families face-to-face at the outset of a traumatic event overseas.</p>
      <p>Expanding criminal injury compensation to families who are victims of deaths abroad is another no-brainer.</p>
      <p>The UK Government should implement these demands as soon as possible.</p>
      <h3>Time to wake up</h3>
      <p>Scotland’s record drugs death figures have been a wake-up call for our political establishment.</p>
      <p>It is a scandal that more than 1000 people lost their lives in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-families-whove-suffered-deaths-20791604">2018</a> – a 27 per cent increase.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Government acted positively by setting up a new taskforce.</p>
      <p>However, if we are to produce a blueprint for the future, we must learn from the mistakes of the past.</p>
      <p>Parts of the political and medical world have been complacent about drug deaths and dismissed new approaches.</p>
      <p>Castle Craig Hospital in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-families-whove-suffered-deaths-20791604">Peeblesshire</a> adopts an abstinence-based approach and has taken in about 200 Dutch patients.</p>
      <p>However, less than a handful of Scots have been funded to attend the centre.</p>
      <p>Public health minister Joe FitzPatrick visited Castle Craig two months ago but nothing has happened since.</p>
      <p>No single panacea exists but we cannot afford to turn our backs on solutions that work.</p>
      <h3>Future’s bright</h3>
      <p>The Prince’s Trust is a great charity that helps 11 to 30-year-olds get into jobs, education and training.</p>
      <p>We should always celebrate the achievements of young people who have overcome difficulties.</p>
      <p>The examples we’ve selected are an inspiration and should be shared widely.</p>
