      <p>AUSTIN, Texas: The Renault Formula One team announced the return of Dirk De Beer as head of aerodynamics on Friday and said an unidentified deputy would also join next year from another team.</p>
      <p>The team said in a statement at the U.S. Grand Prix that Peter Machin, the previous head of aero at the Enstone factory, was leaving by mutual agreement with immediate effect.</p>

      <p>De Beer left Williams in May last year after a troubled start to the 2018 season. He had joined from Ferrari in 2017 after previous stints with Sauber (now Alfa Romeo), Renault and Lotus.</p>
      <p>"In 2019 we have shown some strengths but identified areas that needed reinforcement," said team boss Cyril Abiteboul in the statement.</p>
      <p>"After a rapid growth of our aerodynamic department and a modernisation of our equipment, the strengthening of the management layer of this key department will help us reap the benefits of our investments."</p>
      <p>Renault, with Australian driver Daniel Ricciardo and German Nico Hulkenberg, are fifth in the constructors' championship with three races to go, after finishing fourth last year.</p>
      <p>Formula One approved new regulations for 2021 on Thursday.</p>
