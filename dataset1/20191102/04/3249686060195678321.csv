On November 1, former TV personality/fitting model Jung Da Eun was seen cursing at MONSTA X fans, also known as Monbebes, some time after news of former member Wonho's departure from the group. 



Fans responded with negative reactions to the post and have tried to report it, some answering with strong language of their own:






Many Monbebes are responding with strong language, others are waving off the post by claiming that Jung Da Eun only wants attention, while others have even opted for answering the post with MONSTA X song lyrics.
