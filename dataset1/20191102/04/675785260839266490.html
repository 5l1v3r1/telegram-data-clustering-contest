      <p>Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe is banking on Joshua King to put one over on mentor Ole Gunnar Solskjaer today.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss Solskjaer recommended King to Sir Alex Ferguson and also managed his fellow Norwegian in the Old Trafford reserves.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old striker quit United to join Blackburn in 2013 after growing frustrated at a lack of first-team appearances before moving to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> for a bargain £1million two years later.</p>
      <p>Howe said: “I have never asked Joshua if he feels he has a point to prove to United because it was a long time ago now.</p>
      <p>"I am one of Josh’s biggest supporters, I think he is a fantastic player. There is no ceiling to what he can achieve.”</p>

      <p>United arrive on the south coast on the back of their best run of form since Solskjaer was handed the manager’s job full time.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are unbeaten in all competitions since returning from the international break and followed a 1-1 draw against league leaders <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> with wins over Partizan Belgrade, Norwich and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> .</p>
      <p>Howe said: “Looking at their last few games I think they have played really well.</p>
      <p>“They have some excellent players and a very good manager.</p>

      <p>“I think Ole has handled himself really well. It is such a big job with such a lot of pressure but he has done an excellent job to this point.”</p>
      <p>Bournemouth can leapfrog United in the Premier League table with a win but Howe claims his team’s best is still to come.</p>
      <p>Howe added: “It’s been OK so far this season. I would give us six out of ten. There is more to come.</p>
      <p>"I genuinely believe we can achieve really good things this season.”</p>
