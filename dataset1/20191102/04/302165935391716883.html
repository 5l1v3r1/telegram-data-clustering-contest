      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 2 ― The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) today opened its operations room to enable the public to share information or make complaints concerning any corrupt activity or abuse of power in connection with the November 16 Tanjung Piai by-election.</p>
      <p>The 24-hour operations room is located at the Johor MACC complex on Jalan Persiaran Tanjung in Tampoi, Johor Bahru, said the MACC in a statement issued today</p>

      <p>To facilitate its monitoring efforts, the commission will also be working with the Election Commission and the police.</p>
      <p>The by-election will see a six-cornered fight involving candidates from Pakatan Harapan (PH), Barisan Nasional (BN), Gerakan and Parti Barisan Jemaah Islamiah (Berjasa), as well as two independents.</p>
