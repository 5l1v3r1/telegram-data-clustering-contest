人權組織：警隊被縱容 警暴日趨嚴重

02 Nov 2019, 04:20

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】香港反送中抗爭運動持續進行，在10月31日萬聖節，有人發起到中環蘭桂芳進行蒙面派對，期間有港民及記者被警員以胡椒噴劑直噴面部，此外，在旺角的示威行動中，有社工被警察用警棍打得頭破血流。人權組織表示，警隊被縱容過度使用武力的情況愈來愈嚴重。人權監察發言人葉寬柔指出，港府的這些手段無助解決問題，必須回應市民的核心訴求。
據自由亞洲電台報導，警方10月31日晚在中環多處施放催淚彈驅散聚集人群，並要求市民除下面具、盡快離開。有港民和記者被警察用胡椒噴劑直接噴向面部，其中香港電台一名攝影記者，被警員兩度以胡椒水直噴面部，需要送院治理。
人權監察發言人葉寬柔接受自由亞洲電台採訪時表示，根據國際準則，警方使用胡椒噴劑時須符合武器使用原則，例如警員受到威脅時才能使用，警方不能用武力驅散和平的示威集會，如果集會人士沒有使用暴力，警方亦不能夠使用任何程度的武力驅散。她指在過去一段日子，警隊被縱容過度使用武力的情況愈來愈嚴重。
葉寬柔說：都看到有很多很多濫用武力的個案，令很多人受傷，警方必須遵守武力使用原則，在國際上亦都適用於香港，其中兩個很重要的原則，是要有必要性及相稱性，必要性就是那個情況真的需要用武力才能使用，而相稱性，像昨天（週四）的事件，只不過是與警員在說話，接着就用胡椒噴霧，這是不符合比例的武力使用。
葉寬柔指，政府一直以來使用警隊鎮壓示威，現時又透過申請禁制令，限制市民表達及集會自由的權利，但這些手段無助解決問題，政府必須回應市民的核心訴求。
民權觀察發言人王浩賢表示，在最近幾星期，警方出現濫用胡椒噴劑的情況，事件反映前線警員已不能控制情緒。
王浩賢說：根據警方的指引，他（警察）只能夠在個人對警察有襲擊行為的時候，他才可以用相應的武力回應，而胡椒噴霧就是其中一種，所以如果單純與警員有些質詢，甚至口頭爭執也好，這是不構成一個理據用胡椒噴劑，射向那個人。
香港新聞行政人員協會發表聲明，呼籲警方保持克制，不要粗暴對待或干預記者的合法採訪工作。聲明提到，涉事記者當時已穿着清楚顯示記者身份的衣物，協會對所有暴力予以強烈譴責。
社會工作者總工會週五舉行名為「人道危機：追究失控警員恐怖襲擊記者、救護員、社工」記者會。社總發言人表示，「反送中」運動展開至今，警方暴力不斷升級，甚至針對在現場進行救援的救護員、社工及記者。
有社工在會上表示，週四晚旺角示威活動期間，在彌敦道及荔枝角道交界休憩處看到警員捉住一名長者，上前了解時感到頭部有硬物撞擊，事後看到片段發現自己被警棍打了至少五下。他認為警方打的不只是他的身體，而是在社工的尊嚴上「狠狠打下去」。
據報導，香港爆發「反送中」運動以來，警察暴力鎮壓示威民眾，致使局勢日趨惡化。香港前中央政策組全職顧問、資深時事評論員劉細良日前對大紀元透露，中共長期滲透香港警察工會，包括青關會內的親共組織花巨資收買警方，港警已變成了中共公安，警隊高層官員被劫持，失去權力。
他透露，警察之所以這樣明目張膽，如此霸道，是因為中共在香港的政治勢力滲透到了警察工會，控制了中下層的警察，警隊高層官員都被中下層警察劫持了。
劉細良說，在97年之前，在警察薪酬待遇方面需要一個集體談判的組織，因此才容許警察工會存在，並不是讓他來搞政治的。但現在警察工會一直活躍於政治領域，不少親共組織給警察捐了巨額錢財，僅青關會就捐了幾十萬。這完全沒規矩了，在英治時代是王家警察，不會容許這些事情發生的。
劉細良認為，當警察工會變成一個政治工具的時候，港警必然就變成了中共公安。以往港警是公務員，現在已經不是公務員，其實警務處長已經失去了對警隊的控制，這即是所謂下克上。
他舉例說，劉澤基只是香港警察機動部隊警署警長，居然可以挑戰特首林鄭月娥。還有一個僅是警察員佐級協會的主席也可以去罵大學的校長，以至於教育局長楊潤雄、政務司司長張建宗都沒話說。
劉細良指出，香港警察的轉變始於林慧思事件。2013年7月14日，教師林慧思在旺角不滿共黨地下組織青關會搗亂法輪功街站，路見不平，出聲譴責。而在場警察不僅對青關會的搗亂視若無睹，反而要求林慧思離開，這顯然違反了警察的基本職能。
此後，幕後的政治勢力還有意識地借一些事件，如雨傘運動、曾健超事件等一路鼓動警察工會，中間可能還有一些請客吃飯，公關活動，康樂活動等把警察工會拉攏到它們那邊去，而不是拉攏總警司、行動處副處長等高層。
劉細良表示，最近有傳聞香港員佐級警員（初級警務人員，包括警署警長、警長、高級警員及警員）可以用優惠的折扣，購買大陸地產商在大灣區的房產。媒體應該調查，如果確有其事，說明整個警隊被政治操控並不是始於反送中運動。

Human rights organizations: the police are indulged

02 Nov 2019, 04:20

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] The anti-delivery campaign in Hong Kong continued. On the Halloween of October 31, someone initiated a masked party in Lan Kwai Fong, Central. During the period, Hong Kong residents and journalists were police officers. The pepper spray sprayed directly on the face. In addition, in the demonstrations in Mong Kok, social workers were beaten by the police with batons. Human rights groups say the police have been condoned by excessive use of force. Ye Kwok-ro, a spokesman for the Human Rights Monitor, pointed out that these means of the Hong Kong Government do not help solve the problem and must respond to the core demands of the people.
According to Radio Free Asia, the police deployed tear gas to disperse crowds in various places in Central on the evening of October 31, and asked the public to remove the mask and leave as soon as possible. Some Hong Kong residents and journalists were sprayed directly to the face by the police with pepper spray. Among them, a photojournalist from RTHK was twice sprayed with pepper water by the police officers and needed to be sent to the hospital for treatment.
In an interview with Radio Free Asia, Ye Kwok-ro, a spokesperson for Human Rights Surveillance, said that according to international standards, police use of pepper spray must comply with the principle of weapon use. For example, when police officers are threatened, the police cannot use force to disperse peaceful demonstrations. If the gathering does not use violence, the police cannot use any degree of force to disperse. She pointed out that in the past few days, the police have been indulging in the excessive use of force.
Ye Kuan said: I have seen many cases of abuse of force, which have caused many people to be injured. The police must abide by the principle of the use of force and apply internationally to Hong Kong. Two important principles are necessary. And the proportionality, the necessity is that the situation really needs to use force, and the proportionality, like the event yesterday (Thursday), is just talking to the police officer, then using pepper spray, which is not in proportion Use of force.
Mr Kwok said that the Government has been using the police force to suppress the demonstrations. It has now applied for an injunction to restrict the public's right to express and assemble freedom. However, these measures do not help solve the problem. The Government must respond to the core demands of the public.
Wang Haoxian, a spokesperson for Civil Rights Watch, said that in recent weeks, police abuse of pepper spray has reflected the fact that frontline police officers are unable to control their emotions.
Wang Haoxian said: According to the police's guidelines, he (the police) can only respond to the police when the individual has attacked the police. The pepper spray is one of them, so if there is some question with the police officer, Even a verbal dispute, this does not constitute a justification for using a pepper spray to shoot that person.
The Hong Kong Press Executives Association issued a statement calling on the police to exercise restraint and not to rudely or interfere with the legitimate interviews of journalists. The statement mentioned that the reporters were wearing clothing that clearly showed the identity of the reporter, and the association strongly condemned all violence.
The Social Workers General Union held a press conference on Friday called ""Humanitarian Crisis: Investigating the Terrorist Attack of Reported Police Officers, Ambulance Workers, Social Workers"". A general spokesman said that the ""reverse delivery"" campaign has been carried out so far, and police violence has escalated, even to ambulancemen, social workers and journalists who are on the scene.
A social worker said at the meeting that during the demonstrations at Mong Kok on Thursday night, officers at the junction of Nathan Road and Lai Chi Kok Road saw a police officer catching an elderly man. When he came forward, he felt a hard object hitting his head and saw it later. The clip found that he had been beaten by batons for at least five times. He believes that the police are not only fighting his body, but ""beating"" in the dignity of social workers.
According to reports, since the outbreak of the ""reverse delivery"" campaign in Hong Kong, the police have violently suppressed the demonstrators, causing the situation to deteriorate. Liu Jingliang, a full-time consultant and senior commentator of the former Central Policy Group of Hong Kong, revealed to the Epoch Times that the CCP has long infiltrated the Hong Kong Police Union, including the pro-communist organizations in the Qingguan Association, which spent huge sums of money to buy the police. The Hong Kong police have become the CCP public security, the police high-level Officials were hijacked and lost power.
He revealed that the reason why the police were so brazen and so overbearing was because the political forces of the CCP in Hong Kong infiltrated the police union and controlled the middle and lower police. The top police officers were hijacked by the middle and lower police.
Liu Xiliang said that before 1997, a collective bargaining organization was needed in the police remuneration package, so the police union was allowed to exist, and it was not for him to engage in politics. But now the police union has been active in the political arena. Many pro-communist organizations donated huge sums of money to the police. Only the Qingguan Association donated hundreds of thousands. This is completely unruly. It was a royal policeman during the British rule and would not allow these things to happen.
Liu Xiliang believes that when the police union becomes a political tool, the Hong Kong police will inevitably become the CCP public security. In the past, the Hong Kong Police was a civil servant. Now it is no longer a civil servant. In fact, the Commissioner of Police has lost control of the police force. This is the so-called gram.
For example, he said that Liu Zeji is only the police chief of the Hong Kong Police Tactical Police Station. He can actually challenge the Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue. There is also a president who is only a police officer and a so-called association. He can also go to the president of the university, so that the education director Yang Runxiong and the Chief Secretary for Administration, Zhang Jianzong, have nothing to say.
Liu Xiliang pointed out that the transformation of the Hong Kong police began with the Lin Huisi incident. On July 14, 2013, teacher Lin Huisi was dissatisfied with the Communist Party’s underground organization in the Mong Kok area to disrupt the Falun Gong Street Station. The road was uneven and condemned. The police on the scene not only turned a blind eye to the chaos of the Qingguan, but instead asked Lin Huisi to leave, which clearly violated the basic functions of the police.
Since then, the political forces behind the scenes have consciously borrowed some events, such as umbrella sports, Zeng Jianchao incidents, etc., to encourage police unions. There may be some guests in the middle to eat, public relations activities, recreational activities, etc., to bring police unions to their side. Rather than wooing the Chief Superintendent and the Deputy Director of the Operations Department.
Liu Xiliang said that it has recently been rumored that Hong Kong staff members (primary police officers, including police sheriffs, sheriffs, senior police officers and police officers) can use the discounts to purchase real estate developers in Dawan District. The media should investigate, if it does, it means that the entire police force is not politically controlled.
