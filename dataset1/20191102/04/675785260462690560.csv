What UK time is Rugby World Cup Final 2019? England vs South Africa kick-off time
England face their day with destiny as they take on South Africa with the title of being world champions on the line

England are the bookmakers' favourites heading into the Rugby World Cup Final.
South Africa stand in England's way of their second-ever world title - and already have a victory over the Red Rose in this fixture.
Back in 2007, they broke English hearts to claim the title of being world champions.
But England are a different prospect now, as Eddie Jones faces his day with destiny after four years of preparation for this very day.
