      <h1>Bournemouth's Liverpool loanee Harry Wilson sends message to Man Utd fans</h1>
      <h2>The Wales winger is expecting a hostile reception from Red Devils fans at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday</h2>

      <p>Bournemouth winger Harry Wilson insists he is ready for any stick he might receive from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> fans on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils visit the Vitality Stadium looking to secure back-to-back wins in the Premier League after the 3-1 triumph at Norwich last weekend.</p>
      <p>And Wilson, who is on loan at Eddie Howe's side from United's arch-rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , is expecting a hostile reception from the travelling supporters, but claimed he is ready to use it as a motivator.</p>
      <p>"It's part and parcel of football," Wales international Wilson told the <a href="https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/18010144.if-score-get-back---liverpool-loanee-harry-wilson-will-driven-stick-manchester-united-fans/">Bournemouth Daily Echo</a> .</p>
      <p>“I’m definitely expecting a bit of stick, like I was when we played <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> at the beginning of the season.</p>

      <p>“That comes with it – being on loan from Liverpool and United being their big rivals – it’s going to come my way.</p>
      <p>“Whether it’s on social media or in the games, you are going to get that. You just can’t let it affect you on the pitch, hopefully I can do my job and maybe get a goal.”</p>
      <p>Wilson, who has scored three times for The Cherries this season, added: "When you are getting stick it is always good.</p>
      <p>“If I score, I’ll get my own back. Or if we win, that will feel good for me. It definitely drives you forward.”</p>

      <p>Wilson came up against the Red Devils while on loan at Championship club Derby County last season.</p>
      <p>The winger was part of the Rams side that beat the Premier League giants - managed by Jose Mourinho at the time - on the penalties in the Carabao Cup and made his mark with a stunning free-kick in the 2-2 draw.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> enter Saturday's meeting level on points with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side but they are without a win in their last four league games, which have brought draws against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> , Norwich and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> , and defeat at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> .</p>

      <p>When asked about Saturday's clash, Wilson continued. “Every game in the Premier League is tough but when you are playing a big team like Manchester United, who are full of quality players – they might not be in the best spell at the minute but we know they are going to be dangerous.</p>
      <p>“We feel if we play well and find the form we showed at the beginning of the season, we are confident we can get a positive result.</p>
      <p>“We will have to be at the top of our game.”</p>
