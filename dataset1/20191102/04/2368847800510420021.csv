舊金山豪宅租做Airbnb 萬聖節百人派對驚傳4死4傷

02 Nov 2019, 04:54

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】舊金山一名房客透過Airbnb租房宣稱要在萬聖節辦「12個人的家庭聚會」，結果卻變成一場逾百人派對，屋主自覺被騙後打電話報警，警察接近晚上11時到達時，屋內已變成4死4傷的槍殺案現場。
事發在舊金山東灣一處安靜的住宅區內，房子的主人是華裔邁克爾·黃（Michael Wang），在出租前已聲明「屋內禁止派對」，但當晚從手機的監測電鈴畫面看見多人進出，根本不是承租方所說的「12個人的家庭聚會」。
邁克爾·黃對Airbnb非常生氣，他告訴舊金山當地媒體：「有人說謊。」他認為房客下訂之前，Airbnb不透露客戶資訊，讓房東無法過濾。
據了解，這起百人萬聖節派對，被發現曾在社群平台Instagram上做廣告，名為「Airbnb 豪宅趴（Mansion Party）」。目前廣告已下架。
附近居民說，這個萬聖節派對，有超過100人參加，槍聲與尖叫聲讓當天夜晚變得不平靜。
警方表示，獲報後，在晚上約10時50分抵達現場，已有3人當場中槍身亡，另一人送院後搶救不治，部分傷者自行求醫。



對屋主來說，把房子短期租給不認識的人有其風險。而Airbnb目前宣布將豪宅從平台下架，並對租屋的帳戶停權，調查事件原因。
「舊金山紀事報」（San Francisco Chronicle）指出，未受規範的企業如Airbnb 和Uber有很多潛在未爆彈，預期屋主和Airbnb會有相關法律責任與訴訟。

San Francisco luxury home rent to do Airbnb Halloween hundred people party shocked 4 dead 4 wounds

02 Nov 2019, 04:54

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] A San Francisco tenant claimed to rent a house on Airbnb to run a ""family party for 12 people"" on Halloween. The result turned out to be a party of more than 100 people. The owner consciously deceived and called the police. When the police arrived at 11 o'clock in the evening, the house had become a scene of four deaths and four injuries.
The incident took place in a quiet residential area in East Bay, San Francisco. The owner of the house was Chinese-American Michael Wang. Before the rental, he declared that ""the party was not allowed in the house,"" but many people were seen from the mobile phone's monitoring bell screen that night. In and out, it is not the ""family gathering of 12 people"" that the tenant said.
Michael Huang is very angry with Airbnb. He told the local media in San Francisco: ""Someone lied."" He thought Airbnb did not disclose customer information before the tenant booked, and the landlord could not filter.
It is understood that this 100-person Halloween party was found to have advertised on the social platform Instagram, called ""Airbnb Mansion Party"". The current ad has been removed.
Residents nearby said that there were more than 100 people attending this Halloween party, and the gunshots and screams made the night unsettled.
The police said that after being reported, they arrived at the scene at about 10:50 in the evening. Three people were shot dead on the spot. The other person was rescued after being sent to hospital. Some of the injured were seeking medical treatment on their own.



For homeowners, renting a house for a short period of time has a risk. Airbnb is currently announcing the removal of luxury homes from the platform and suspending the account of the rental house to investigate the cause of the incident.
The San Francisco Chronicle pointed out that unregulated companies such as Airbnb and Uber have many potential unexploded ordnance, and that homeowners and Airbnb are expected to have legal liabilities and litigation.
