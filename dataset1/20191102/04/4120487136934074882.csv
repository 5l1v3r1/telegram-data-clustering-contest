02 Nov 2019, 04:04

【点滴新闻网雅加达11月01日讯】佐科威总统表示，他仍然接受组建肃贪会（KPK）监督委员会提供的意见。未来，肃贪会监督委员将由佐科威总统直接指定，而不是根据新肃贪会法通过选举。“ 我们仍为未来是谁将担任肃贪会监督委员会听取他们提供的意见。”佐科威周五（11月1日）在雅京中区总统府综合大楼如是说。根据现行规定，肃贪会监督委员由佐科威直接指定。他确保肃贪会监督委员的信誉毫无疑问。“ 这是首次不通过肃贪会甄选委员会（Pansel），请相信被选中的人他们的信誉及可靠性不容置疑。”佐科威如是说。“ 肃贪会监督委员与新专员的就职仪式定于12月举行。”佐科威说。众所周知，肃贪会监督委员会是新肃贪会法的修订版之一。肃贪会监督委员会被认为能够削弱肃贪会采取的措施。这是因为调查员和检察官进行的窃听、搜查和扣押必须得到肃贪会监督委员会的许可。肃贪会监督委员会将由总统委任。

[Jakarta News, November 01] President Zocco said that he still accepts the advice provided by the KPK Supervisory Committee. In the future, the Supervisory Committee of the Anti-Corruption Commission will be directly designated by President Zocco, instead of passing the election according to the New Corruption Law. ""We are still in the future who will serve as the Supervisory Committee of the Anti-Corruption Commission to listen to their opinions."" Zocoway said on Friday (November 1) in the Yajing Central District Presidential Complex. According to the current regulations, the Supervisory Committee of the Anti-Corruption Commission is directly designated by Zokewei. He has no doubt that the credibility of the Anti-Corruption Commission is undoubted. ""This is the first time that Pansel has not passed the Corruption Association. Please believe that the credibility and reliability of the selected people is beyond doubt,"" said Zoco. “The inauguration ceremony of the Supervisory Committee and the new commissioner of the Anti-Corruption Commission is scheduled to be held in December,” said Zokov. As we all know, the Anti-Corruption Commission Supervisory Committee is one of the revised editions of the New Corruption Law. The Anti-Corruption Commission Supervisory Committee is believed to be able to weaken the measures taken by the Anti-Corruption Commission. This is because eavesdropping, searching and seizure by investigators and prosecutors must be approved by the Supreme Council. The Anti-Corruption Commission will be appointed by the President.
