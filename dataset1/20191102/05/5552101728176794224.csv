汲取早期好萊塢精髓　三谷幸喜電影致敬美日名導
02 Nov 2019, 05:28 by 項貽斐 , 洪偉韜, 李政達
三谷幸喜是日本喜劇名導，他的喜劇創作也別具傳承意味與復古色彩。三谷幸喜曾與日本名導伊丹十三、市川崑合作，也受到早期好萊塢電影影響，尤其推崇美國名導演比利懷德（Billy Wilder）與法蘭克卡普拉（Frank Capra）。而在他的作品中，不時可以看到向上述日本前輩及美國名導經典致敬的影子。



三谷幸喜的第一部電影《心情直播，不NG》讓他成功建立在影壇的名聲，也暗藏對導演伊丹十三的敬意。伊丹十三電影《蒲公英》是飲食喜劇的超級經典，不過他卻在1997年自殺身亡。三谷幸喜曾參與伊丹十三遺作《被監護的女人》初期的編劇工作，《心情直播，不NG》除了邀請《蒲公英》女主角宮本信子、伊丹十三的妻子客串，還安排《蒲公英》裡扮演貨車司機的渡邊謙，同樣演貨車司機，讓兩部片產生巧妙的聯繫。
具有演員身分的三谷幸喜，曾在名導市川崑2006年版的《犬神家一族》中飾演旅館老闆。後來三谷幸喜執導電影《魔幻時刻》，則請市川崑飾演該片戲中戲的導演，留下市川崑大銀幕最後身影。

三谷幸喜的成名舞台劇《12個溫柔的日本人》改編自好萊塢名導薛尼盧梅（Sidney Lumet）1957年的電影《十二怒漢》（12 Angry Men），後來三谷又將這個故事改成電影劇本，由中原俊執導拍出日語版電影。
此外，三谷幸喜最賣座的電影《鬼壓床了沒》，結合喜劇、恐怖片、法庭戲等不同類型，還透過老電影一圓親情夢，設計讓法蘭卡普拉的經典《民主萬歲》（Mr. Smith Goes to Washington）及《風雲人物》（It's a Wonderful Life），成為片中草彅剛喜愛的電影。
