      <p>NORTH SOUND: Opener <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Priya-Punia">Priya Punia</a>'s well-compiled fifty went in vain as the Indian women's team suffered a narrow one-run defeat against the West Indies in the first ICC Women's Championship ODI here.</p>
      <p>Chasing 226 to win, Punia smashed six boundaries in her 107-ball innings, while Jemimah Rodrigues (41) scored a 67-ball 41 at the top but they didn't get enough support from lower-order to be dismissed for 224 in 50 overs by the hosts.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Stefanie Taylor opted to bat first and produced a captain's knock, scoring a 91-ball 94 studded with eight boundaries and two sixes.</p>
      <p>Opener Natasha McLean also put up a good show, smashing a 82-ball 51 as West Indies posted a competitive 225 for 7 at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium on Friday.</p>
      <p>Defending the total, off-spinner Anisa Mohammed came up with a superb bowling performance, claiming five wickets for 46 runs. She was ably supported by Taylor (2/30) and Shabika Gajnabi (2/25), who snapped two wickets each.</p>
      <p>India couldn't score the required eight runs in the last over with Mohammed removing <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ekta-bisht">Ekta Bisht</a> (0) and Poonam Yadav (0) in the first and final deliveries respectively to hand West Indies a thrilling win.</p>
      <p>Earlier batting first, Taylor (94) and McLean (51) did bulk of the scoring, while Chedean Nation (43 off 55) also chipped in with a useful contribution but rest of the batting failed to fire against the Indian bowlers.</p>
      <p>For India, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deepti-Sharma">Deepti Sharma</a> (2/41) and Shikha Pandey (2/38) took a couple of wickets, while <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/jhulan-goswami">Jhulan Goswami</a> (1/46) claimed one.</p>
      <p>Punia and Rodrigues gave India a good start, forging a 78-run opening partnership before Taylor dismissed the latter in the 22nd over.</p>
      <p>Punia and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Poonam-Raut">Poonam Raut</a> (22) then looked to build the innings but a run out ended the partnership as India slipped to 124 for two in 32nd over.</p>
      <p>Punia also shared a 46-run stand with skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mithali-Raj">Mithali Raj</a> (20) but she was removed by Mohammed in the 40th over with India still needing 56 to win.</p>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Harmanpreet-Kaur">Harmanpreet Kaur</a> (5), Deepti Sharma (19) and Jhulan Goswami (14*) tried their bit but there was hardly any support from the lower order in the finishing stages.</p>
      <p>The two teams will face off again in the second ODI on Sunday.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Brief Score:</b>
      </p>
      <p>West Indies 225 for 7 in 50 overs (S Taylor 94; S Pandey 2/38) beat India 224 all out in 50 overs (P Punia 75; A Mohammed 5/46) by one run.</p>
