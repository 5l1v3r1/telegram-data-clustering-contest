「國民男神」英年早逝　當年2歲兒子現在是演技大咖
02 Nov 2019, 05:28 by 項貽斐 , 洪偉韜, 李政達
有日本「國民喜劇家」稱號的三谷幸喜，無論舞台劇、電視劇或電影都經常與日本大牌明星合作，並且與他們建立好交情，保持合作關係。在新片《失憶的總理大臣》裡的中井貴一、佐藤浩市，都曾多次演出三谷幸喜的作品，兩人甚至連劇本都沒看，就點頭接演，對他信任的程度可見一斑。



三谷幸喜笑說，邀請中井貴一演出《失憶的總理大臣》時，只對他說「我想幫你拍一部喜劇，成為你演員生涯的終身代表作。」中井貴一聽了就回答，「好，我什麼都演。」由於該片之前，三谷幸喜就曾與中井貴一合作舞台劇與日劇，十分了解對方的特質，因此該片劇本完全針對中井貴一打造，讓他成為片中時而嚴肅、時而搞笑、時而懦弱無能的總理大臣。
中井貴一與三谷幸喜除了工作默契之外，也有些共通點。兩人都是1961年出生於東京，父親同樣早逝。中井貴一的父親佐田啓二是1950、60年代的日本大明星，是《請問芳名》系列電影男主角，也演過名導小津安二郎電影《秋日和》《秋刀魚之味》，堪稱當年「國民男神」。不過在中井貴一不滿3歲時，父親就因車禍意外身亡，這也成為中井貴一心中一大遺憾。

《失憶的總理大臣》中，中井貴一貴為總裡，卻因忽然失憶，人生出現轉折。問他如果也像劇中人般失憶，會希望為現在的自己帶來怎樣的改變？他有點無奈地笑說：「想要更加傲慢地活著，非常任性的，但很可惜我不是這種類型的人。我覺得能變成這樣的人，必須在有才能、有自信的環境下生活。」
中井貴一坦言，雖然父親早逝，但他一直被保護著。進入演藝界後，不論電影票房多好，或是得到獎項，都不太有人稱讚，反而不斷被比較，總是被說「比不上爸爸」、「不夠用功」、「如果這樣的話，不會被小津安二郎導演所用」....，這些都讓他學不會傲慢任性地活著。

""National Male God"" died young. The 2-year-old son is now acting.

Sangu Yuki, who has the title of ""National Comedy"" in Japan, often works with Japanese big-name stars regardless of stage plays, TV series or movies, and establishes friendships and relationships with them. In the new film ""The Prime Minister of Amnesia"", Nakai Kiyoshi and Satohoshi City have performed three works of Miyuki Yuki. The two even did not even read the script, and they nodded and performed. The degree of trust in him is evident.



Miyuki Yuki said that when he invited Nakai to perform ""The Prime Minister of Amnesia"", he only said to him, ""I want to help you make a comedy and become a lifelong masterpiece of your actor's career."" Zhongjing Gui answered and answered, ""Okay, I played everything."" Because of the film, Sangu Yuki had worked with Nakai to play a stage play and a Japanese TV drama, and he understood the characteristics of the other party very well. Therefore, the film was completely created for Nakai, making him a serious and sometimes time-honored film. A funny, sometimes weak and incompetent minister.
In addition to the tacit understanding of work, Zhongjing Guiyi and Sangu Yuxi have some common points. Both were born in Tokyo in 1961 and their father died as early as possible. Nakai's father, Sakata Kiyoshi, was a Japanese star in the 1950s and 1960s. He was the leading actor in the series ""Imperial Names"" and also played the famous Ozu Yasujiro movie ""Autumn Day"" and ""The Saury of the Saury"". National male god."" However, when Nakai was less than 3 years old, his father died in a car accident, which also became a big regret in Nakai.

In the ""Minister of the Lost Prime Minister"", Zhongjing Guiyi was the general, but because of sudden loss of memory, life turned a corner. Ask him if he also lost his memory like a human being in the drama, what kind of change would he hope to bring to himself? He smiled a little helplessly: ""I want to live more arrogantly, very self-willed, but unfortunately I am not this type of person. I think that being such a person must live in a talented and confident environment. .""
Zhongjing Guiyi said frankly that although his father died young, he has been protected. After entering the show business, no matter how good the box office is, or the awards, no one praises it. Instead, it is constantly being compared. It is always said that it is ""not comparable to Dad"", ""not enough work"", ""If this is the case, it will not It was used by the director of Ozu Yasujiro...., these made him learn to live arrogantly and arrogantly.
