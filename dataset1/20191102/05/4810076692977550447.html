      <p><a href="https://idle.slashdot.org/~haaz">haaz</a> (Slashdot reader #3,346) tells us that history has just been made as part of the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals annual online game-playing fundraiser, <i>Extra Life:</i> <br/><i>A man from Milwaukee, Wisconsin is trying to play pinball long enough to break the standing Guinness World Record for Longest Marathon Pinball Play of 30 hours 10 minutes. <br/><br/>He's using Extra Life's gaming/DIY fundraising site to <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&amp;participantID=388439&amp;language=en&amp;fbclid=IwAR1Ro7-mLlCAhi1Mm6UtktcnZfwVR4ymjeCkeSWfmQuP3AFIt3MODMA2XGY">webcast his attempt</a> and raise money for Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. He gets <a href="https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-father-attempts-to-break-guinness-world-record-for-longest-pinball-play/29670051#">a five minute break every hour</a>, and yes, he's wearing an adult diaper.</i> <br/>Just minutes ago on Twitter, the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin announced <a href="https://twitter.com/childhealthwi/status/1190729541003677699">he'd beaten the record</a>. And lots of other fundraising game-playing marathons are happening <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/carroll/news/cc--20191023-zmpxjgflpbaw7ff567efmyeu54-story.html">around</a> <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/114767/shacknews-extra-life-charity-marathon-livestream-fundraiser">the</a> <a href="https://www.wishtv.com/news/local-news/gaming-marathon-raises-money-for-riley-childrens-hospital/">world</a> today, including <a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/gamers-gather-at-west-ed-to-support-stollery-childrens-hospital">one in Canada</a> -- and many of them are being streamed online.<br/><br/>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_Life_(fundraiser)">event began in 2008</a>, and over the last four years has raised close to $10 million each year. As one gaming site put it, "Let's <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/extra-life-2019-how-weird-is-it-gonna-get/ar-AAJyxF8">help the future programmers of our cyborg overlords</a> fulfill their mission by streaming some video games for the kids this weekend!"</p>
