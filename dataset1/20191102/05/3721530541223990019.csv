With Diablo 4’s recent unveiling at BlizzCon 2019, the studio revealed three playable classes coming to the game. Players can choose between a Barbarian, Druid, or Sorceress — likely among other unannounced classes.
At BlizzCon, we got to try out each of these characters, and wrote down all the skills we could find. It’s worth noting that these skills will likely change before Blizzard officially launches Diablo 4.
