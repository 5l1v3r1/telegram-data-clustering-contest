REUTERS: A multistate outbreak of salmonella linked to ground beef has caused one death in California and eight hospitalizations, US health officials said on Friday.
A total of 10 people in six US states were infected with a strain of the bacteria called Salmonella Dublin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The illnesses from this strain, a type usually found in cattle, are more severe than expected for salmonella, which usually has a 20 per cent hospitalization rate, the agency said.
The patients were between 48 and 74 years and 80 per cent of them were male, the agency said.
Retailers can continue to sell ground beef and consumers can consume thoroughly cooked beef, the CDC said.
No common supplier of ground beef has yet been identified.
