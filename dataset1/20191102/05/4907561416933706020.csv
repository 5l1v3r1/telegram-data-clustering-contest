Forbidden construction in the foresight
02 Nov 2019, 05:00 by Tamer Heper
Forbidden construction in Bosphorus front view. A citizen can not even nail a plot of land on the neighboring parcel was made apartment, was rented out, the owner earns money. Moreover, he applied for forgiveness of zoning and legalized his situation. What's so special about this neighbor? ● M.U.
★★★★★
Yes There is no zoning permit for those who have land in the front view area of the Bosphorus. Contrary to this, both the demolition of the building and criminal proceedings are subject to criminal charges. However, it is possible for maintenance and repair of old buildings with the same location.
It was so careful that a file in my hand raised the roof of the citizen building by 10 centimeters against the criminal case was opened. The citizen may not be able to measure the elevation of 10 centimeters on the roof, it is likely that he did not do it on purpose, but such a case was filed.
★★★★★
Therefore, the construction that my reader mentioned was illegal, and the municipality should have intervened during the construction and had to keep the building holiday report for the construction. But my reader told me it was even rented. This is for the front view of the Bosphorus.
It is also claimed that he applied for the zoning forgiveness. Moreover, there are areas outside this system in the practice we call zoning forgiveness. For example, Istanbul Historical Peninsula, Istanbul Bosphorus front view. Good, but this citizen in front view and has applied for forgiveness.
All this is against the law and the municipality should take the necessary steps. I don't think your neighbor has any features.
