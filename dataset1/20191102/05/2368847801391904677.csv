【命理】男朋友被奪 八字中能看出來嗎？

02 Nov 2019, 05:26

「橫刀奪愛」這句成語，不知起源於何時？但這種現象在近代卻悄然流行起來，它與古人的「君子成人之美」，和「君子不奪人所好」的意思剛好相反。也就是說近代的人，君子少了，小人多了。這是與近代社會的世風日下、道德沉淪、迷戀物慾、自私為己，不信神、不信因果報應等有關。
橫刀奪愛這等事，既會出現在男士身上，也會出現在女子身上，但出現在女子身上時，其受到的傷害和打擊會更大。因為男士生活中除了情感、婚姻、家庭外，尚有事業、精神等方面的追求和發揮；而女子的一生，大多以感情、婚姻、家庭為重，萬一在此方面遭到不幸和打擊，則會受到很大的衝擊，甚或導致有些人看破紅塵，離塵出世。
影響如此重大的事，在八字中能看得出來嗎？在實踐的經驗中，有的是可以看出來的，試用下例解釋：
以出生日的天干代表自己，此造出生日是辛亥日，上面的天干是辛金，所以屬辛金命。如圖，用紫色的辛金來代表自已。而月干也是辛金，金與金同類，在家代表兄弟姐妹，在外代表你的朋友，或閨蜜。如果應用到愛情和婚姻中，就可能是你的競爭者（第三者）了。那未在八字中是用什麼來代表你的丈夫（未婚前代表你的男朋友）呢，那就是丙火了。因此火能剋金，所以火就是辛金女命的官星，也是夫星，而此命的夫星（官星）丙火出現在年干上，如圖，用紅色字表示。
現在可以看到，你命中的丙火夫星（或男朋友）並不在你（紫色的辛金日主）旁邊，而是在你的競爭者（月干辛金）旁邊，這位競爭者或者會是你的朋友或閨蜜，或者是你不認識的另一位，總之，你命中第一個訊息是：你早期認識的男朋友，如果早婚，就是指第一次婚姻，那麼這個男朋友（或丈夫）不是屬於你的，他和另一位女性（月干辛金）更接近。
再說，根據命學天干五合的原理，丙火見到辛金，就會「丙辛相合」。換句話說，你的男朋友會跟你的競爭者（第三者）結合，不會跟你結合，因為你和男朋友之間隔著一個「她」，而這個「她」和你男朋友更接近。所以如果自己命中出現這種情況時，就應事先有心理準備，不至於將全部身心投入去，以免真的發生此種事時，悔不可及。或者不要將第一次的情感經歷當作婚姻，因為這不會是你最終的婚姻。這是男朋友會被他人奪去的第一個特徵，由夫星看出來的。
第二是再看夫宮，也稱夫位。是指丈夫（未婚前代表男朋友）在你命中的宮位，它是在日主辛金自已坐下的地支上，在此命中就是指亥水（用紅色字表示）。現看這亥水在這八字中是否喜用神，或是否忌神？喜用神則代表丈夫對你有幫助，忌神則代表無助力。同時再看此夫宮與左右兩地支有無發生沖刑或會合等關係，也會顯示出婚姻的狀態出來。
例如此命夫宮與時支寅木有六合之關係：「寅亥合木」，也是指夫宮被他支所合，這又多了一種可能性，指丈夫或男朋友會與外人結合。結合到上文分析過的天干「丙辛相合」，現在地支夫宮的「寅亥六合」，因此，命中出現丈夫或男朋友被她人奪去的機會就大大增加了。
第三點，就是看夫星丙火和夫宮亥水對自已的命有無幫助，也可以看出日後的婚姻對自己是好是壞了。現查看日主辛金生黃曆十二月，天寒地凍，在北方還會是冰天雪地，調候為急，以丙火為主要之用，如果八字中缺了火，寒冷而毫無生機，其他配合得好也無用。
現看到此命丙火官星剛好透出，所以夫星為喜用，對自已有幫助。再看天干二辛金、一庚金，地支二土可生金，日主已不弱，可喜木生火為用，忌水、金、濕土。而夫宮是亥水，所以夫宮為忌神，對自己沒有幫助。根據夫宮之力大於夫星的原則，所以整體說來此造的婚姻狀況弊大於利。可能有人說，不是寅亥合木，忌神水合成木，化忌為喜，也可以這麼說，但在冬令寒木見水，反而成濕木，濕木不生無炎之火，利弊互見。
最後要看的一點是，日主辛金自坐亥水，金能生水，這亥水就是日主的「傷官」了，顧名思義，就是會傷害官星（夫星），因為傷官亥屬水，官星丙屬火，水剋火。一個傷害官星的五行駐守在丈夫的宮位，這豈不是大忌嗎？所以常說夫宮是傷官的女命，婚姻多少會有些麻煩，命書中說：女命傷官福不真。也是指此等情況。
為什麼呢？因為傷官格，或有傷官的女命，大多數會多才多藝，或清逸秀麗，或兩者皆有之。但也有心高氣傲、個性強烈、不服夫管，還要管制干涉或傷害丈夫的特點。
結合到此命屬辛金，屬水銀赤碧珍珠之類，生冬天十二月，日主自坐傷官，真有點冰雪聰明之意。因而與男友相交之時，男友雖欣賞你的美貌、聰明、才智，但他怕比不上你，更怕你傷官格的強烈個性，及喜歡管制丈夫的特點。當然你自己不知道，以為找到了一位白馬王子，便常邀請女友或閨蜜與自己男友一起聚會，殊不知你男友在你的女友或閨蜜之中，發現了更適合於自己的女性，她的才貌、精明能幹雖然遠不及你，但她脾氣、性格溫和、平靜，易於相處，這就提供了讓她人橫刀奪愛的可能機會了。
加上自己命中天干、地支的兩處被合，命中已有男朋友會被他人合去的跡象，自己還不小心，不幸的事情就這樣發生了。
假如此命生在夏天，本身就火多，忌火。萬一天干的丙火官星（男朋友）被辛金（第三者）合去，影響還不太大，少些火，反而會更好。表現出來可能是，你這時的男朋友是一個好吃懶做的人，甚或去賭博，或有一幫豬朋狗友，不務正業的人，這樣的男友，被她人奪去，還求之不得呢。
但此造生在冬天，全靠這透出的丙火為取暖、調候之用神，現在被她人合走，等於偷走了你心中所有的光明，取走了你生活中的全部的溫暖，讓你整個人猶如跌落在冰凍寒冷無望的深淵，你再也無法忍受，無法承擔，於是終於看破紅塵，循入空門。@*#

[Medical] Boyfriend was captured. Can you see it in the eight characters?

02 Nov 2019, 05:26

The idiom ""cross-cutting love"" does not know when it originated? However, this phenomenon has quietly become popular in modern times. It is exactly the opposite of the ancients' ""the beauty of a gentleman's adult"" and the ""the gentleman does not take advantage of others."" That is to say, in modern times, there are fewer gentlemen and more villains. This is related to the modern world, the ethical indulgence, the obsessive material desire, the selfishness, the unbelief of God, the unbelief of karma and so on.
Cross-cutting loves these things, it will appear on men, but also on women, but when they appear on women, they will be hurt and hit more. Because in addition to emotions, marriage, and family, men’s life still has the pursuit and play of career and spirit; while women’s life is mostly based on feelings, marriage, and family. If they are unfortunate and hit in this regard, then It will be greatly affected, or even cause some people to see through the red dust and leave the dust.
Can such an important thing be seen in the eight characters? In the practical experience, some can be seen, try the following example:
Representing myself as the birthday of the birthday, this birthday is Xinhai Day, the sky above is Xin Jin, so it is a life of Xin Jin. As shown in the figure, the purple gold is used to represent itself. The moon is also a gold coin, gold and gold are similar, representing your brothers and sisters at home, representing your friends, or girlfriends. If applied to love and marriage, it may be your competitor (third party). What does it mean to represent your husband in the eight characters (representing your boyfriend before the marriage), that is C fire. Therefore, the fire can be gold, so the fire is the official star of the Xin Jin female life, but also the husband star, and the life of the husband star (official star) C fire appears on the year, as shown in the figure, in red.
It can be seen now that the Clive Wolf star (or boyfriend) you hit is not next to you (purple Xinjin Sun Lord), but next to your competitor (Yue Ganxinjin), the competitor or It will be your friend or girlfriend, or another person you don't know. In short, the first message you make is: If you know your boyfriend, if you marry early, it means the first marriage, then this boyfriend ( Or husband) is not yours, he is closer to another woman (monthly Xinjin).
Besides, according to the principle of life-study and five-in-one, when C fire sees Xin Jin, it will be ""Bing Xin."" In other words, your boyfriend will be combined with your competitor (third party) and will not be combined with you because you are separated from your boyfriend by a ""her"" who is closer to your boyfriend. . Therefore, if you happen to be in this situation, you should be mentally prepared in advance, so that you will not put all your mind and body into it, so as not to regret when it happens. Or don't treat your first emotional experience as a marriage, because it won't be your final marriage. This is the first feature that a boyfriend will be taken away by others, as seen by the husband.
The second is to look at the palace, also known as the husband. It refers to the position of the husband (before the unmarried representative boyfriend) in your hit. It is on the ground branch where the Japanese Lord Xin Jin himself sat down. In this hit, it refers to the sea water (in red). Now, does this Haisue like to use God in these eight characters, or is it a jealous? Hi, using God means that your husband is helpful to you, and jealousy means no help. At the same time, look at the relationship between this husband's palace and the left and right branches, whether it is rushing or meeting, and it will also show the state of marriage.
For example, this life-fighting palace has a six-in-one relationship with the time-supporting coffin: ""Yuhai Hemu"" also refers to the Fugong Palace being supported by him. This is another possibility that the husband or boyfriend will be combined with outsiders. Combined with the above-mentioned analysis of the ""Bai Xin Xiang He"", now the ""Yi Hai Liu He"" of the Difufu Palace, the chance of hitting her husband or boyfriend to be taken by her is greatly increased.
The third point is to see whether the husband and the fire of the husband and the husband of the palace have helped their own lives. It can also be seen that the marriage in the future is good or bad for themselves. Now look at the Japanese Lord Xin Jinsheng in the yellow calendar in December, the weather is cold, and there will be ice and snow in the north, and the emergency is urgent. The fire is the main use. If there is no fire in the eight characters, it will be cold and lifeless. Other cooperation It’s useless to be good.
It is now seen that this life-fired official star just emerged, so the husband star is happy, and has helped himself. Look at the Tiangan two Xinjin, one Geng gold, the ground support two soils can produce gold, the Japanese Lord is not weak, can be used for wood fire, avoid water, gold, wet soil. The husband's palace is Haishui, so the husband's palace is a taboo and does not help him. According to the principle that the power of the husband's palace is greater than that of the husband, the overall marital status of this creation is more harmful than good. Some people may say that it is not the Heihe Hemu, the gods water synthetic wood, the taboo is hi, can also say so, but in the winter, the cold wood sees the water, the anti-wet wood, the wet wood does not produce the fire without fire, the pros and cons .
The last thing to watch is that the Japanese lord Xin Jin is sitting in the water, and the gold can produce water. This is the ""injury officer"" of the Lord. As the name suggests, it will hurt the official star (Fuxing), because the wounded Water, official star C is a fire, water is a fire. Is it not a big taboo to have a five-line of the official star in the husband’s house? Therefore, it is often said that the husband's palace is the female life of the wounded, and the marriage will be somewhat troublesome. The life book says: The female life is not true. Also refers to these situations.
why? Most of them will be versatile, or beautiful, or both, because of the injury to the official or the wounded official. But there are also arrogance, strong personality, disobedience, and control of the characteristics of interference or harm to the husband.
Combined with this life is Xinjin, it is a kind of Mercury Pearl and Pearl. In the winter of December, the Lord is sitting on the injured officer. It is really a little snowy and clever. Therefore, when I meet my boyfriend, my boyfriend appreciates your beauty, intelligence, and intelligence, but he is afraid of not being able to compare with you, and is more afraid of the strong personality of your official identity and the characteristics of controlling your husband. Of course, you don't know. I thought that when I found a Prince Charming, I often invited my girlfriend or girlfriend to party with my boyfriend. I don't know if your boyfriend found a woman who is more suitable for you in your girlfriend or girlfriend. Although she is far from you, her temper, gentle personality, calm and easy to get along with each other, this provides a possible opportunity for her to cross the knife.
In addition, the two hits of his own hits and the earthly branches, the signs that the boyfriends will be taken away by others, are not careful, and unfortunate things happen.
If you are born in the summer, you will be much more angry and avoid fire. The one-day-old C fire official star (boyfriend) was joined by Xin Jin (third party), the impact is not too big, less fire, but it will be better. It may be that your boyfriend is a lazy person, or even a gambler, or a group of pigs and friends, not a business person, such a boyfriend, was taken away by her, but also can not ask for it.
However, in the winter, this kind of fire is the god of heating and waiting for the fire. It is now being taken away by her. It is equivalent to stealing all the light in your heart and taking away all the life in your life. Warmth, let your whole person fall like a frozen and cold hopeless abyss, you can no longer bear, can not afford, so finally see the red dust, enter the empty door. @*#
