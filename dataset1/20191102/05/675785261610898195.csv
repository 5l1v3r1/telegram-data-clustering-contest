What channel is England vs South Africa on? Rugby World Cup Final TV and live stream information
England are looking to win their second-ever World Cup and are the big favourites heading into the clash with South Africa

Eddie Jones faces his day with destiny as England take on South Africa in the Rugby World Cup Final.
Jones had always claimed that he was building England for success at this year's competition and he has guided them to the final.
But after a sensational performance against New Zealand in the semi-finals, have England peaked one game too soon?
The Red Rose are unchanged for the final - the first time Jones has named an identical starting line-up for around three years.
Here is all you need to know ahead of the match...
