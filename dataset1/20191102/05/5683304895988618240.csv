Saxena wins 7 wickets in Deodhar Trophy Why don't you call?
02 Nov 2019, 05:45 by Manorama Correspondent
What does Jalaj Saxena have to do with Ranchi Eye India? Madhya Pradesh native Jalaj Saxena, who made a splendid performance in the Ranji Trophy for Kerala but missed out on the Indian team, has once again shown his magic in domestic cricket. Jalajjin's bowling performance for the India C team against India A in the Deodhar Trophy cricket match in Ranchi is as follows: 9.5–0–41–7. Jalaj set a record seven-wicket haul in the Deodhar Trophy.
Jalaj's brilliant bowling performance with captain Shubhman Gill and India's Mayank Agarwal helped India to a 232-run win over India. India won the toss and elected to bat where they put up a score of 36 runs for the loss of three wickets. Devdath Patil (31) is the top scorer for India A.
India won the toss and elected to bat. Gill and opener Mayank Agarwal scored centuries as opener Gill and India scored a huge score. Agarwal and Gill were at the crease with 38.3 overs to spare India B's bowling attack. By then, India had flipped the scoreboard to 226 runs. Agarwal hit 120 off 111 balls with 15 fours and a six. Gill, who hit 143 with 10 fours and six sixes, came back to be third. Suryakumar Yadav then hit an unbeaten 72 off 29 balls with nine fours and four sixes.
Jalaj Saxena literally swept India A's bat. Saxena came after Dhwal Kulkarni, Abhishek Raman (two out of five balls) and skipper Hanuma Vihari (zero) were dismissed by striking Malayali star Vishnu Vinod. Saxena became the go-to source for all the rest in the tent. Devnath Padikal (31 off 54 balls), Bhargav Merai (30 off 41), Ashwin (1), Unadkat (two), Ravi Bishnoi (13 off 14) and Siddharth Kaul (15 off 33 balls) were the key players. Balls 17) are the victims of Saxena.

ൊപ്പം With Kapil, but ..!

Jalaj Sahai Saxena, 32, is one of the few players to be featured in an all-rounder club in domestic cricket. He is one of the players who has scored 6000 runs and 300 wickets. Legendary stars CK Nayudu, Lala Amarnath, Vijay Hazare, Vinoo Mankad, Poly Umrigar, Ravi Shastri and Kapil Dev are all in the cast. But whenever you think of this achievement, you lose a sense of loss.
Jalaj is the only player in the Indian senior squad who has never had a chance to play. Jalaj Matu proved that when the BCCI put him on the board of presidents team against South Africa. Man of the Match in Test cricket
