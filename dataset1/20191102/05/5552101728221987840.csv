In an email to employees, Cognizant CEO Brian Humphries said that establishing a healthier cost structure is a means to a clear end – driving growth
Cognizant has said the current cost optimisation drive will end by 2020 and result in total charges of approximately $150-200 million in severance and exit costs


BENGALURU: There’s more bad news for senior employees at Cognizant. The Nasdaq-listed firm is deferring increments and promotions to them, partly to contain costs.
“We are making changes to the manager-plus annual salary revisions and promotions process. We are refining the process not simply to contain costs, but to drive greater career mobility, just in time promotions and a more meritocratic culture. Therefore, for this population we are deferring all decisions on salary increase and promotions until next year,” said Cognizant CEO Brian Humphries in an email to employees.
There have been uncertainties around salary hikes in the IT industry this year, with several companies deferring hikes for certain segments, especially mid to senior executives. The reasons have varied, from fall in revenue growth to declining margins.
Cognizant has said the current cost optimisation drive will end by 2020 and result in total charges of approximately $150-200 million in severance and exit costs, and bring annualised gross savings run rate of around $500-550 million in the year 2021.
Cognizant has rolled out salary hikes up to the level of senior associate. That was reflected in the September paycheque and was effective from July 1.
Humphries said in the email that establishing a healthier cost structure is a means to a clear end – driving growth. Cognizant, he said, plans to invest over $200 million in four digital battlegrounds – cloud, IoT, digital engineering and data.
This money, Humphries said, will go into “the previously announced hiring of approximately 500 revenue generating associates over the coming year, a combination of customer facing and sales support professionals who will help us in expanding existing accounts as we generate new ones. Significant investments in Cognizant Academy and in technical skills as we aim to reskill and redeploy our talent towards digital imperatives. Accelerated investments in tooling and automation and increased investments in marketing, branding, as we aim to strengthen our international operations and our digital brand.”
Cognizant Academy provides learning resources, labs, licenses, certifications, deep-dive classroom sessions, and alliance partner content. Recently, Cognizant said it expects to double its investment in technical education next year.

[Full Text] Filming into the theater nutrient
02 Nov 2019, 05:28 by Xiang Fei, Li Zhongquan, Hong Weiwei, Li Zhengda
The name of Miyuki Yuki has a ""Hi"" character, which is like ""Hit with Happiness"". In the past 40 years, he has brought joy to the Japanese heavyweight comedy director through stage plays, TV dramas and movies. The new film ""The Prime Minister of Amnesia"" brings together stars such as Nakai, and Sato, and creates a ridiculous and ridiculous taste.
Continue to create the background of the stage play and the screenwriter, let the movie of Miyuki Yuki have a theater feature and get inspiration from the actors. Each of his films is personally directed, ""Because you know what you want best!""



The business map is a ""national comedian"" in Japan, which is a favorite of the three series of dramas, TV series, and movies. He was born in the drama class. He was a group of ""Tokyo Sunshine Boys Troupe"" in college. He still continues to direct stage plays. His films are also influenced by stage plays. Not only do they pay special attention to actors, but they also write scripts about the characteristics of actors. The new film ""The Prime Minister of Amnesia"" (hereinafter referred to as ""Prime Minister"") is a political comedy from the acting male star Nakai.

From 1997, he was screenwriter, Tamura Masaki and starred in the Japanese TV drama ""Don't call me Prime Minister"", and this year's ""Prime Minister"", the protagonists are politicians, but Sangu Yuki said: ""I am not going to shoot political satire, or pass Political message, just want to take a professional person to shoot a fantasy story."" He has a ""cold-faced laughter"" title, he said funnyly: ""I used to be a prime minister when I was young, but now fewer and fewer children will be like this. I thought, so I took this movie.""

As early as 10 years ago, Sangu Yuki had the idea of ""Prime Minister"". However, it was not until 2 years ago that he decided to star in Nakai, and he worked with the screenwriter. In recent years, Sangu Yuki and Nakai Kenichi have cooperated with many TV dramas and stage plays, and they have always wanted to create a comedy for him. Miyuki Yuki revealed: ""If it is not for Nakai, it will be replaced by another actor. This film may be completely different. Every time an actor is promoting my creation.""
""In addition to the first film ""Mood in the Live, Not NG"", because there are already stage plays, other films are the first to decide the candidates, and then write the script for the actors. In this scene, I want to give Zhongjing Guiyi a sense of happiness, seriousness, There is also a feeling of black belly. These three parts are played out, so the role of ""Prime Minister Kuroda"" was born."" Although the relevant materials have been collected and some political figures have been seen, they are for reference only. The contents of the film are purely fictitious.


Sangu Yuki, who has the title of ""Cold-faced Smile"", is also a screenwriter, director, and actor. His career map spans different fields such as stage plays, TV series, and movies.


In fact, most actors can understand the script. The difference is that when I communicate with him, it can be understood in 10 minutes or 10 seconds.
Despite the fact that the familiar actor's face is constantly appearing in the movie, he stressed that the casting will not be limited to the actors who often cooperate. ""If you meet a very good actor when you work together, you will want to cooperate. In fact, most actors can understand the script. The difference is that when I communicate with him, it can be understood in ten minutes or ten seconds."" ""Prime Minister"" Fujioka Aya, Ishida Yuriko, etc. are the first films to perform in Sanki Yuki, but the character male Sato Sato is a team, and even the script does not seem to agree to take over.


The first film ""Miss Live, Not NG"" edited by Sangu Yuki is adapted from the stage play he directed. From the left, the actors are Suzuki Jingxiang, Tang Zeshou Ming, and Nishimura Masahiko. (Revolving from chenchifeng2017.blogspot.com)

Sangu Yukie has produced a huge and luxurious lineup for each film. He said: ""When you play a stage show, there will be a few actors performing. But when you are making a movie, you prefer the way the group plays, and you can describe each character in detail. No role is irrelevant, I like the feeling that each is the protagonist.""
Having said that, in the face of many actors on the same stage, Sangu Yuki stressed that the most important thing about movies is the sense of balance. Even if you look for a lot of super big coffee, it doesn't mean it will be interesting, so the configuration of the casting is the most nerve-racking, but also the most interesting place. For example, in the ""Prime Minister"", the Prime Minister, who is played by Nakajima, has three secretaries with different personalities and images, such as Fujioka Aya, Koike Eiko, and Masuda Takashi. The match is very balanced and perfect.

The creatively rich Sangu Yuki, developed in the entertainment industry by stage plays, TV series, and then into the film, deep stage drama skills, also provide the most direct nutrients when making movies.
Sangu Yuki said frankly: ""I am not a film director. Unlike some directors who use splicing, post-production or shooting at a special angle, I lack technical expertise in this area. But the experience of the stage drama makes me actor's Advantages and vitality. In addition, he always likes to use long shots and mirrors to let the actors perform and walk in one go, and this powerful force is once included in the lens, which is also related to the stage play.
Because the stage plays are all telling stories in a closed limited space, Miyuki Yuki is also good at dealing with this part, and it is more humorous. ""I like to shoot in the shed, so every time I take a picture, I will be scared by the outdoor wind. .""

Between the screenwriters, directors, actors, novelists and other multiple identities, Sangu Yuki believes that his essence is actually a screenwriter. ""I am a screenwriter who is a filmmaker, not like a director."" He always hopes to be a group. Pinion, don't want to always rush to the front, this point he does not think it is very suitable for being a director, and the happiest moment of his filming is the moment when the script is completed.


Sangu Yuki continued to create a stage play, and last year he directed the stage play ""Transformed Doctor"" to come to Taiwan to perform. (Reviewed from tifa.npac-ntch.org)


The advantage of self-directed self-directed is that I know what I want best and can reflect interesting places. The disadvantage is that I want to take the script, but I want to add a lot of things, and the result is getting longer.
The writer who started the screenwriter is particularly focused on the original script. The eight movies directed so far, except for one stage script adapted from him, the rest are his original scripts. ""The advantage of self-directed self-directedness is that I know what I want best and can reflect interesting places. The disadvantage is that I want to take the script, but I want to add a lot of things, and the result is getting longer."" He said that most of his own writing. It’s a comedy, and if he’s inconsistent with the director’s smile, it’s very troublesome. His script was filmed by other directors, but he always felt that he was the most hilarious.
His father died early in the film, and he was very fond of the mother. He liked the American movies of the 1950s and 1960s that his mother took with him. The origin of the film was also a Hollywood comedy, or a British situational comedy. Miyuki Yuki pointed out that it is absolutely impossible to forget that the filming is actually a person, and people still feel the best laugh when they see people's performance. This is what he observed when he went to the zoo. ""People especially laugh when they look at orangutans at the zoo and pick up animals that are closer to people. But the more reptiles are from humans, the less they smile.""

Fortunately, he has a special liking for the comedy. When he is writing, he never tests the reaction of his friends to laughter. Even the producers will not. He believes that the most important thing about making comedy is that you have to be funny. If you can't laugh, you will raise the audience. ""I get laughter, hope and vitality from the movie, and I hope to convey this energy to the audience through shooting comedy. ""
