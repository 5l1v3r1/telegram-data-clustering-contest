(first published October 1, 2016)

- Sure it is nice to have complements for nice cleft, and it is nice to drop bra, but it is important for me to emphasize that I do not have silicone in the tits because I am vain, it is because I do not want to die, says Cecilia Linn Bie.
She has a gene defect, inherited from generation to generation. Every 12th woman gets breast cancer, and the gene defect increases the risk by 60 percent. The explanation we need 670 years back in time to find.

The game is over: Hustvedt & Co closes its doors for good.
 (first published August 24, 2019)

Tor and Per Søiland have spent their entire professional life in the toy and gift shop in the butter island of Stavanger city center. They have planned the closure for several years.
Items that were never sold, shelves they never needed. Now the brothers are in full swing with the cleanup after 146 years of shop operations. Well before the Christmas holidays, the traditional store locks for good.

Big interview with Erling Braut Haaland
 
(first published October 26, 2019)

Erling Braut Haaland, who turned 19 on July 21, has scored six goals in the Champions League in three games. No one, not the very, very greatest, not Ronaldo, not Messi, not Robert Lewandowski. Only Erling has made it clear.
He is fiery in a whole football world. On the field he is the big leader, outside he is a modest boy from Bryne. We met him in Salzburg.

In a large interview with Aftenbladet he gives of himself:


He tells of the family that is so important and always wholeheartedly supportive.
He talks about grandma's dinners.
He talks about the sports and football genes, about mom and dad.
He tells of the good coaches, the ones who have understood him.
He tells of life alone in Salzburg.
He talks about the dreams.
