      <p><b>LOS ANGELES (AP)</b> - Crews are battling the last remaining large wildfire in Southern California as stubborn flames threaten nearly 2,000 homes.</p>
      <p>The Maria Fire headed for what would be its third day Saturday after erupting on a Ventura County hilltop northeast of Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Nearly 11,000 people are under evacuation orders. Fire officials say the communities of Eastern Ventura, Camarillo, Somis and Santa Paula are at risk.</p>
      <p>The cause is under investigation but Southern California Edison, which cut power to many areas this week to prevent wildfires, said Friday that it had re-energized a power line just minutes before the fire began nearby.</p>
      <p>Red flag warnings of extreme fire danger from winds and ultra-low humidity have been extended into Saturday evening for some areas of LA and Ventura counties.</p>
