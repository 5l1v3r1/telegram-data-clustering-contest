Instant Karma: Honda Brake Checks Hummer, Getting in Trouble

02 Nov 2019, 05:13


Unfortunately, mean behaviour on the road is not uncommon. For example, manoeuvres such as ""brake checking"" occur when one driver deliberately brakes very hard on another driver that is right behind them. This is done in order to punish the latter, usually for tailgating.

The characters in this video, drivers of a Honda and a Hummer, respectively, were also involved in a brake checking situation. However, one of them didn't think he would come off the worst in this, for sure. The battle between the two cars started (and obviously instantly finished) on a highway near Waterbury, Connecticut. The Honda decided to punish the Hummer for some unknown reason and brake checked it, but the outcome of Honda's scheme more than likely didn't make the driver happy, as the Hummer was up to the task and smashed into the smaller car several times.

Transformation into the financial technology industry Six major preparations | Wu Hanming
02 Nov 2019, 05:36 by Wu Hanming Jeffrey
Financial technology seems to be a new subject for the younger generation. How do you prepare for transformation in the financial world or want to enter the financial technology sector?

(1) Learning: Free software such as Coursera, Udacity, etc., for half an hour every day. In fact, I don't really believe in paid platforms. If you have to get a degree to gain motivation, you may wish to try it. When I graduated, there was a gap between the current level of artificial intelligence and knowledge. I also followed up on Andrew Ng's Coursera course and used output (such as writing a book) to force myself to learn. Now this column is also training my own writing and refining thinking. Learning opportunities. It is good to have a conditional commitment to the school curriculum, but you need to tell which new bottles are used (such as packaging statistics into big data subjects or using non-open source tools to analyze data) and which are leading technologies.


If you want to join the financial technology industry, you should make good use of free software such as Coursera and Udacity online, and learn for half an hour every day.

(2) Application scenario: Financial service scenarios and other industry processes are human decisions. As long as your work involves eye-speaking (speech, not eating) or hand, all financial services are needed. What is important is that I have to work hard and don't have to be so horrified. I am most afraid of seeing people saying that their work can't be changed, so they change jobs. I can't change my work automatically, Hong Kong's professional services also need related transformation, I believe that after doing this, a lot of people want to recruit you, including me.
Practice more communication, change your mindset
(3) Exercise: Participate in the competition and search for hackathon. I tried to participate in the hackathon that I am very interested in in my 30s, but I learned to solve the problems in the industry. I won't win the prize and the income is generally not enough. It’s the weekend time.
(4) Communication: Many community circles are free. For example, AI Society HK, Artificial Intelligence Hong Kong on Meetup, I feel that some paid networks may not have people who are doing research and development in good faith, but more people in marketing. .
(5) Mentality: Technology, especially innovation, 99% of people will not give you good words, and most people will tell you at the beginning that it is superfluous, or is not complete, useless. Although considering the results, people are right, but at least you are trying, people are still standing still. I believe that before the Internet and power invention, people would say that it is superfluous. Technology is the result of countless attempts. I remember that when I was building a department database, people were very good at Excel/PPT presentations. It didn't need a database, but after 3-5 years of accumulation, the database became the department's assets, and it was similar to other departments. The function. Technology needs to be accumulated, and it cannot be appreciated before accumulation reaches a critical point. In addition, open source sharing and win-win, creating the blue ocean, is the thinking of Internet finance, which is completely different from the zero-sum theory of the financial trading market.
Financial technology must continue to learn
(6) Software: The mainstream technology software is open source, and even the operating system is free, such as Ubuntu (open source operating system), Python, Pytorch, Hadoop (large database). It is recommended to prepare an expired computer to try. I myself probably need to reinstall Ubuntu 30 times or so because of various accidents.
When I graduated, I felt that the IT technology line was too bitter. I had to constantly learn and often eliminate it. But when I came down, I found that change was the last word. The above suggestions don't know how to implement it? Let's try it first.
Advertising: November 4-8 is Hong Kong FinTech Week, when I will be in the company to participate in the exhibition, I hope everyone can communicate!
