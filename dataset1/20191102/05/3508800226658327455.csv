《私の悲傷敍事詩》：比起在大學，我的詩人學校給予我的人文教養也許更多
02 Nov 2019, 05:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是知識分子的身分在面對警察國家的暴力時，也無聲以對。這就是戒嚴時期的台灣，是世界在六八革命、青年們反體制現象群起時的巨大反差。就是那樣的年代，我在大學經歷歷史學的形式梳洗。



文：李紀
月蝕
六八革命的時候，我重拾學業，進入台中的一所大學修習歷史。這個也被以法國革命稱之的學潮，是相應於越南戰爭的學運，左翼思想、反資本主義、反官僚的戰後嬰兒潮世代群起抗爭，不只在歐洲，也在美洲及亞洲的日本形成效應。因為反戰，因而反美，這在反共前線的台灣是缺席的，報紙偶爾會有些報導，但一些評論都指向共產黨分子滋事。戒嚴體制下的台灣，大學青年被體制馴服，反共救國團伸入高中、大學校園，吸收青年入黨，青年的視野被局限在體制的高牆裡。
台中已是我熟悉的地方。褪下軍服，但在大學裡仍須接受軍訓課程，也只能虛應以對，應付了事。修習歷史而非文學，我認為更適合自己，太感性的人生也許要經由知性的調整，要修正自己不切實際的人生觀。即使我選擇了要成為文學工作者，要走詩和小說寫作的路，我也不認為就要讀文學科系。我喜歡那種非科班出身的詩人和小說家。像俄國的契訶夫就是學醫出身的作家，他的小說有細膩的人生觀察。
家裡很高興我又進入大學。原來父親一直期待我讀醫科，成為醫生，家裡從小學就是我到親戚家寄宿求學，也因為那種特別的寄望。我知道入伍服役而中斷學業的我讓父親失望，但我並沒有受到指責。沒有放棄大學文憑，父親是欣慰的。家裡仍然像對待未成年孩子一樣負擔我的學費和生活，但我自己覺得應該多少也分擔一些。打定了要打工、兼差，我在府後街的一家小廣告公司找到文案的工作，那是一家小公司，同意按件計酬，不必正常上班。因為這樣，我在附近的自立街找到一個住處，是一個民家的二樓。兩個地方都鄰近我就讀的大學，我買了一台中古腳踏車代步，騎個十幾分鐘就可以到學校。
大學的課程比我想像的更貧乏，同班同學以女生居多，都是晚於我年紀的一輩。開始時，我很少與同學打招呼，常常上課到、下課離開，把自己孤立在同學之外。倒是，打工的公司有一些女同事，與我年紀相仿或稍長，工作接觸還熱絡融洽，她們有些像大姊一樣照顧我，還會開玩笑說要介紹女朋友給我。
常常去一家兼賣書籍與文具的書店買書、買稿紙。那時時興著流通在卡片上印一些詩句，老闆問我要不要試寫一些讓他印成卡片，我常常摘錄在自己筆記簿的簡單行句，交給他，也得到一些費用。我也寫稿，把像是小說的稿作寄給報紙副刊，發表後也會得到一些稿費。從高中未畢業中途退出，原以為寫作是可以謀生的行業，其實並不那麼容易。如果靠稿費，那會是有一餐沒一餐，現實的殘酷在離開學校、再進到大學讀書的這一段日子，才真是體會到。
說是修習歷史，其實我自己仍然喜歡自己的漫讀。就像在高中時，學校的課本以外，文學、哲學、藝術的書籍，愛不釋手，常常覺得教科書的內容太平庸了。期中考、期末考，應付起來沒什麼，大學學歷似乎也只是某種應付社會需要的文憑，倒是自己要充實日後真正進入社會的本事。班上的同學知道我已服過兵役，比他們年長，也知道我兼了一些工作，也偶爾會在報紙、雜誌發表作品，對我都滿親切的。
有一回，一位詩人應邀來學校演講，是晚上的時間，在學校以已故校長為名的大禮堂舉行。我也去參加了，那時他名氣滿大的，出身外文系，又喝過洋墨水回來的詩人、學者，有一種光環。演講的開場白，他還特別提到學校裡有一位同學是年輕優秀的詩人，他說就是在台下，他並不認識也沒有看到的我。那時期，我讀了他在《草笠》發表的詩〈在冷戰的年代〉，有些刮目相看。同期也有我的一首詩。我不喜歡像〈蓮的聯想〉那類新古典情趣的調性。口語白話有節奏感的文字，感覺比較真實。
我喜歡七等生和陳映真的作品，高中時期，學校圖書館的刊物，就有兩人的小說。七等生謎樣的小說氛圍，像〈來到小鎮的亞茲別〉，那麼不知所以的鬱鬱不樂，感覺像黑白電影中一個蒼白的男子朝向迷霧籠罩的海濱走去，只看見不斷消失的背影，而陳映真的小說，像〈將軍族〉裡，康樂隊的女生和伸縮喇叭手，後來在送葬的隊伍中，前導指揮的女生和伸縮喇叭手的老兵，在久別相遇的悲愴人生敘述後，第二天早晨被人看到雙雙躺在甘蔗園，被說是像將軍的結局。陳映真和一些人被捕的消息在這年暑假傳出，那時我在家中又重讀了他的作品。
讀這些小說比在大學讀的教科書還更能啟發心智。我嚮往的就是這樣的文學風景。但我不能放棄我重新拾起的大學學業，已走過一段冤枉路，對於家人來說，我算是好不容易重回軌道。在青春已逝的人生階段，我試著讓自己安置下來，盡量在現實與理想中取得平衡，有叛逆的心，但我不能再任意叛逆。新兵訓練中心、裝甲兵學校、裝甲兵訓練中心的服役經驗都像烙印，在我已過往的青春裡。
兼差的公司有一位女生，家裡大拜拜，邀請大家去鬥熱鬧。公司的同事們一起到她在北屯的家。屯區是相對市區的市郊，是傳統屯墾留下來的社區聚落，正好以東、西、南、北環繞著核心的中區以及東、西、南、北區。野台戲、廟會、刣豬公，整個社區都籠罩在節慶的氣息之中，辦桌的宴席，此起彼落的划拳、勸酒、乾杯，夜色和燈光交錯，醉醺醺的我被公司的女同事攙扶搭乘計程車回住處，在車上我幾乎躺睡在她的肩上。第二天，我才知道這位女同事把我安置在睡床，才回自己住處。
我仍然會去「文藝沙龍」喝咖啡，和老闆也熟識起來。他是一個讓人感到有些夢想的生意人，喜歡叼著香菸，常常坐在靠近櫃台的一個位子，看著客人也對客人微笑。我常在那兒聽古典音樂，特別喜歡德弗乍克的《新世界交響曲》，在厚重的樂音中似乎洋溢著鄉愁。咖啡館裡的青年們和我一樣大多留著長頭髮，這是時代的氛圍，是反體制的一種風潮。台灣的一些青年們也用這樣的方式去連結世界。在現實上我們不能反叛，但是象徵性的反抗也是一種行動。
留著長髮是要被取締的。有一個夜晚，我從「文藝沙龍」出來，走向中正路，想要經由市府路，轉府後街，再經三民路到第五市場旁自立街的住家，但在中正路上就遇見警察正圍堵長髮青年。被認為長髮有礙風俗的青年，一個一個到了派出所，除了面對警察的叱責外，還當場由理髮師修剪頭髮。我近距離地觀察警察的取締行動，從圍觀的人群空隙裡看看戒嚴法下的暴行。
一位台大外文系教授，也是小說家，留了長髮，就在一次取締中被警察帶到派出所，在警察叱責聲中，那位教授表明他是台大外文系教授身分，警察回應說教授更應該作學生的表率。知識分子的身分在面對警察國家的暴力時，也無聲以對。這就是戒嚴時期的台灣，是世界在六八革命、青年們反體制現象群起時的巨大反差。就是那樣的年代，我在大學經歷歷史學的形式梳洗。
在《創世紀》、《南北笛》發表了一些詩後，我也在《草笠》發表作品，並因此認識了同樣是戰後嬰兒潮世代的年輕詩人。鄭君是我高中的校友，曾經活躍在校刊，我在學校時不在校刊投稿，互相並不認識，但經由《草笠》而相逢。他在台中讀醫科，算是繼承了父志，已經在《草笠》建立一些名聲，受到前輩詩人的器重。因為都來自高雄，曾為高中校友，都寫詩，逐漸成為知交，假日常常相見。
《草笠》的創辦人群，有許多是跨越語言一代，是從日本語而中文的詩人。我初次在《草笠》登出作品，那一期也發表了葉笛譯介的日本詩人鮎川信夫《何謂現代詩》中〈詩人的條件〉，我對其中「所謂要活在現代，便是被強制著A、卡繆的三個命題：肉體的自殺，哲學的自殺，以及反叛的抉擇，亦即從叛逆走向社會面的熱情，對於行動的知識份子已成為最寬敞的門，成為一步步走近新全體主義的危險深淵。」感動不已，抄詩在自己的筆記簿。
隨後的一期《草笠》，李魁賢譯的Georg Ried《德國現代詩史》，就開始刊出了。在第二章的〈價值的崩解〉，托瑪斯．曼就登場了，結尾有獻給他的頌辭：「托瑪斯．曼—藝術與生命的探勘者／在招損與成就之間，頗多滄桑／在精神的歡暢裡，為時代的內容所繫念／於文中塑造自由安詳」，經由日本或經由世界的《草笠》詩人學校，在我心中是這樣形成的。接著托瑪斯．曼的是卡夫卡—異於冷靜方式，充滿熱心的同情，對現代詩發生巨大的影響。在《德國現代詩史》的連載中，「卡夫卡塑造了現代人在荒謬的現象世界裡的焦慮不安，他被棄絕，無家可歸，神也失落，卡夫卡控訴機構化的世界。」然後，布來希特，「以劇作家的身分，極力而且堅定地控訴『貪心』、『自得的市民』，及其對道德的偽誑。」
比起在大學，我的詩人學校給予我的人文教養也許更多。在一九六○年代中後期，正當全世界的戰後嬰兒潮世代正在反叛體制，冷戰的氛圍在美蘇對抗的形勢形塑，我身在詩的世界觸及這些脈動。戰後的台灣形同被類殖民統治，沉澱在歷史陰影裡的二二八事件，從跨越語言一代詩人的言談中透露出來。那是我出生的一年，在我已離開的高中教室的紅牆的彈痕，那經由一位體育老師不經意地說出的祕密，彷彿伴隨我人生的祕密，與歷史見證者交會，我的啟蒙也經由這樣的交會而形成。
我後來和鄭君有時會一同前往住在豐原的詩人家。他也是一位小說家，以小說留下在南洋參加太平洋戰爭的台灣人的日本經驗。一九三○年代末就讀台中一中，因為抗議日本皇民化的改名，在學校和同學發動抗議學潮而未能畢業的他，一九四○年代初被以自願兵名義徵召，終戰時在印尼爪哇的叢林度過戰俘營的日子。他一九四○年代和我的一九六○年代都是從青春跨入社會的轉變過程，正是二十歲世代的相仿年齡。我的詩人之路關連著某種共同的時代性和世代性。
一九六○年代中後期的台灣，正是從白色恐怖時代的陰影逐漸展現覺醒的時代。我加入的《草笠》是和《台灣文藝》同年創辦的本土文學刊物，分別以現代詩小說作為墾拓內容。同在一九六四年的〈台灣人民自救運動宣言〉，因在印刷廠製作過程被密告，而未能發布，彭明敏教授和他的兩位參與學生也都被捕入獄，後來彭明敏流亡出國，但自救運動以不同的形式展開。《草笠》和《台灣文藝》象徵的就是文學的自救運動。
陰影是存在的。美軍B52轟炸機在清泉崗空軍基地起降，進行越戰的行程，在台灣的上空造成轟隆的爆裂聲，形成像日蝕一樣的時代陰影，遮蔽了太陽光。而戒嚴制的陰影在一九六○年代中後期，也像月蝕現象。心靈的月光被遮蔽在威權政治的權力夢魘之中。就像二二八事件的歷史隱含在人們的心裡，就像一九五○年代的白色恐怖隱含在人們的心裡，時代的感覺在父親的世代和我的世代依然存在著傷痕。只不過加工出口的經濟支撐著市街的繁榮景象，霓虹的亮光閃爍在沿路的商店，夜晚常常看見人潮，有時候卻也在其中。一面在大學就讀，一面兼及一些文案工作，一面寫著自己青春過敏性煩惱留下來的虛虛實實故事。有時，我也會想起在南方的梨花，不知道她怎麼樣，她還想念我嗎？或許，已遺忘我了吧！
對於梨花，我心裡懷著歉意，覺得自己軟弱又自私。我在筆記簿寫下一些懷念她的心情，也試著以散文或小說形式記憶那些已逝去的歲月。在重新走上體制教育，成為一位大學生的我，並沒有在學校得到多少效益。修習歷史，但我喜愛的歷史哲學課程幾乎沒有，中國史排定許多課程，但對台灣的存在課題探討得極少，簡直視若無睹。我只想快快走完學程，只耽讀自己喜愛的書，應付應付考試，能畢業就好。
班上的同學也感覺到我到大學是來過門的，並不是我不認真讀書，而是我有自己的想法。在那樣的年代，世界的大學生們正抵抗著文明的發展體制，冷戰時期以美蘇對抗構成的秩序就像枷鎖一樣，青年們想要掙脫，充滿了裂痕。我應該是那樣的世代，經歷了冷戰在台灣的反共國策的馴化，其實是疏離於世界的。我們留著長髮，把一些國外的搖滾、反戰歌曲，當作流行音樂一般接受。我們在大街上看到許多美國大兵的身影，他們從越南戰場來台度假，而我們的新聞報導大多只看到越戰怎麼在南越、北越和美國在戰場的激烈交火。台灣也有非武裝軍事人員在南越，雖不像南韓派遣武裝部隊師團直接參戰，但基本上是以反共之名報導，評論在越南的事況。被孤立在被美國作為越戰補給站的台灣，唯一的反叛或許就是及肩的頭髮，或許這就是夜晚警察在街頭取締青年長髮現象的原因。
比起留著長髮的外表，更為重要的是內心。開始寫了一些反戰詩，在《草笠》發表。一種莫名的戰爭陰影，被化為行句，在我的作品裡出現。有一首戰爭被提及的詩〈遺物〉，就是那時期抄錄在筆記簿的作品，不知怎麼，我以女性視野，用未亡人的角度，寫下這首詩。
從戰地寄來的君的手絹休戰旗一般的君的手絹使我的淚痕不斷擴大的君的手絹以彈片的銳利穿戳我心的版圖……
寫了〈遺物〉這首十二行詩之後，我又陸續寫了許多反戰詩，成為我一九六○年代末期的詩歷程。以女性作為發言者，並且從自己青春過敏性煩惱的詩情走出來，我有一種真正成為一個詩人的感覺。服從的擬似戰爭經歷使我從觀念性走向血肉化、也是我的一種覺醒歷程。在抒情之外，加上批評的意味，我的詩的安魂曲彷彿日蝕的光影之執，吟詠著時代的觀照。
夜晚走在台中的市街，常是我從電影院出來的時分，人群已逐漸減少，沿著綠川從成功路走向中正路，向左看是台中火車站，向右走到自由路，左轉在民權路右轉，再到三民路左轉，經過台中醫院和市議會，走到自立街第五市場後，就到住處。夜間的行路，一個人踽踽獨行，一面回味腦海中電影的情節，一面思索自己人生的況味。
那陣子，我迷上電影，安東尼奧尼的《蝕》被以《慾海含羞花》的片名上映，我在狄西嘉之外，再體會另一位義大利導演的詩情記事，後來我還寫了一篇他的隨筆，發表在校刊。電影和詩較為相似，影像與意象，斷與連的敘述形式。法國的新浪潮，楚浮的名字；義大利的新寫實主義，我從電影想像敘述行句的進行。詩與現實，想像與經驗，黑白與彩色。一個人靜靜地在電影院裡觀賞，或閱讀，彷彿一本一本書的書頁翻閱著我被時代侵蝕的人生。

""Private Sadness Narrative Poetry"": Compared to college, my poet school gave me more humanities education.
02 Nov 2019, 05:00 by Featured Book Picks


What we want you to know is that the identity of intellectuals is silent when confronted with violence in the police state. This is Taiwan in the period of martial law. It is a huge contrast between the world in the June 8th Revolution and the anti-institutional phenomena of young people. It was in that era that I experienced the form of history in the university.



Text: Li Ji
Eclipse
During the June 8th Revolution, I regained my studies and entered a university in Taichung to study history. This school movement, also known as the French Revolution, is a student movement corresponding to the Vietnam War. The left-wing ideology, anti-capitalist, and anti-bureaucratic post-war baby boomers fought against each other, not only in Europe but also in the Americas and Asia. effect. Because of the anti-war, and thus against the United States, this is absent in Taiwan on the front line of the anti-communist front. Newspapers occasionally have some reports, but some comments point to the Communist Party. In Taiwan under the martial law system, young university students were tamed by the system, and the anti-communist national rescue team reached the high school and university campus, absorbing young people into the party, and the youth’s vision was confined to the high walls of the system.
Taichung is already a place I am familiar with. I lost the military uniform, but I still have to take military training courses in college, and I can only deal with it. Studying history rather than literature, I think it is more suitable for oneself. A life that is too emotional may have to be adjusted through intellectuality to correct its unrealistic outlook on life. Even if I choose to become a literary worker and take the path of poetry and novel writing, I don't think I have to study the Department of Literature. I like poets and novelists who are not born in science. Like Chekhov in Russia, he is a writer who studies medicine. His novels have a delicate life observation.
I am very happy at home and I am entering university again. It turned out that my father had been expecting me to study medicine and become a doctor. From the elementary school, I went to my relatives to study in the home, and because of that special hope. I know that I was disappointed by my father’s dismissal when I entered the military and I was not accused. The father was gratified not to give up the university diploma. The family still bears my tuition and life as a child, but I think I should share some of it. I decided to work and make a difference. I found a copywriting job at a small advertising company in Fuhou Street. It was a small company that agreed to pay by piece and didn't have to go to work. Because of this, I found a place in the nearby Zili Street, which is the second floor of a private home. Both places are close to the university I attended, I bought a medieval bicycle, and I can go to school in ten minutes.
The university's curriculum is much less than I imagined, and the classmates are mostly girls, all of whom are older than my age. At the beginning, I seldom greet my classmates. I often go to class, leave class, and isolate myself from my classmates. However, the working company has some female colleagues, similar to my age or a little longer, the work contact is still very harmonious, they take care of me like a big brother, and will jokingly say to introduce my girlfriend to me.
I often go to a bookstore that sells books and stationery to buy books and buy manuscript paper. At that time, there was a circulation of some verses on the cards. The boss asked me if I wanted to write some cards for him to print. I often extracted the simple sentences in my notebook and gave them some fees. I also write a manuscript, send a manuscript like a novel to a newspaper supplement, and I will get some manuscript fees after publication. I quit from high school and graduated from the middle school. I thought that writing is an industry that can make a living. It is not so easy. If you rely on the draft fee, there will be a meal without a meal. The cruel reality of reality is really a matter of leaving the school and going to college.
It is said to be a history of practice. In fact, I still like my own reading. Just like in high school, outside the school's textbooks, books on literature, philosophy, and art, I don't want to let go, often feel that the content of textbooks is too mediocre. The mid-term exam and the final exam have nothing to deal with. The university degree seems to be only a kind of diploma to meet the needs of the society. Instead, it is necessary to enrich the ability to truly enter the society in the future. The classmates knew that I had served in military service, were older than them, and knew that I had some work, and occasionally published works in newspapers and magazines, and I was very kind to me.
One time, a poet was invited to come to the school to give a speech, which was held at night in the grand auditorium of the school in the name of the late principal. I also went to participate. At that time, his famous poet and scholar who came from a foreign language department and had returned to foreign ink had a halo. In the opening remarks of the speech, he also mentioned that there is a classmate in the school who is a young and outstanding poet. He said that he is in the audience. He does not know or see me. At that time, I read his poem ""In the Year of the Cold War"" published in ""Grass"", and some looked at it. There was also one of my poems during the same period. I don't like the neoclassical taste of the kind like ""Lian's Lenovo"". Spoken vernacular rhythmic text, feels more real.
I like the works of Qi et al. and Chen Yingzhen. In the high school period, there are two novels in the publications of the school library. The mysterious atmosphere of the seven-year-old mystery, like ""Azbe to the town"", I don't know why it is so unhappy. It feels like a pale man in a black and white movie walking towards the misty waterfront, only to see disappearing The back, while Chen Yingzhen’s novels, like the ""Generals"", the girls of the Kang band and the trombone, and later in the funeral process, the girls of the leading conductor and the veterans of the trombone, the sorrowful life narrative in the long-awaited encounter Later, the next morning, people were seen lying in the sugar cane garden, said to be like the general's ending. The news that Chen Yingzhen and some people were arrested came out during the summer vacation this year, when I reread his work at home.
Reading these novels is more inspiring than textbooks that are read at college. I am looking forward to such a literary landscape. But I can't give up the university study that I picked up again. I have gone through a long road. For my family, I am really hard to get back on track. In the stage of my youth's dying life, I tried to let myself settle down, try to strike a balance between reality and ideals, and have a rebellious heart, but I can no longer arbitrarily rebel. The service experience of the boot camp, the armored soldier school, and the armored soldier training center are all branded, in my past youth.
The poor company has a girl who worships at home and invites everyone to fight. The company's colleagues went to her home in Beibei. The reclamation area is a suburb of the urban area. It is a community settlement left by the traditional hustle and bustle. It is surrounded by the central, eastern, western, southern and northern regions of the east, west, south and north. Wild TV dramas, temple fairs, and pigs, the entire community is shrouded in the atmosphere of the festival, the table banquet, the ups and downs of boxing, persuasion, toast, night and lights intertwined, drunk I was the company's female colleague I took a taxi back to my place of residence, and I almost slept on her shoulder in the car. The next day, I realized that the female colleague placed me in the bed before returning to my place of residence.
I will still go to the ""Arts Salon"" to have coffee and get acquainted with the boss. He is a businessman who feels a little dream, likes to hold cigarettes, often sitting in a seat near the counter, watching the guests smile at the guests. I often listen to classical music there, especially to Duffelk's New World Symphony, which seems to be filled with nostalgia in thick music. The young people in the cafes, like me, mostly have long hair. This is the atmosphere of the times and a wave of anti-institutionalism. Some young people in Taiwan also use this way to connect the world. In reality we cannot rebel, but symbolic resistance is also an action.
Keeping long hair is to be banned. One night, I came out from the ""literary salon"" and went to Zhongzheng Road. I wanted to go through the city road, transfer to the back street, and then go to Sanmin Road to the home of the self-standing street next to the fifth market, but I met the police on Zhongzheng Road. Enclose a long-haired youth. Young people who are considered to be obsessed with long-term behavior, one by one, went to the police station. In addition to facing the police’s blame, they also trimmed their hair on the spot by the barber. I watched the police's banning action up close, and looked at the atrocities under the martial law from the crowds of the crowd.
A professor from the Department of Foreign Languages at National Taiwan University, who is also a novelist, left long hair and was taken to the police station by a police officer in a ban. In the police blame, the professor indicated that he was a professor of foreign language at the National Taiwan University. The police responded that the professor Should be a model for students. The identity of intellectuals is also silent when confronted with violence in the police state. This is Taiwan in the period of martial law. It is a huge contrast between the world in the June 8th Revolution and the anti-institutional phenomena of young people. It was in that era that I experienced the form of history in the university.
After publishing some poems in Genesis and Nanbei Di, I also published works in Cao Yu, and I therefore met young poets who were also post-war baby boomers. Zheng Jun is an alumnus of my high school. I used to be active in the school magazine. When I was at school, I didn't submit the manuscripts in the school magazine. I didn't know each other, but I met them through the Grasshopper. He studied medicine in Taichung, and he inherited his father's ambition. He has established some reputations in ""Grasshopper"" and is valued by his predecessors. Because they are all from Kaohsiung, they used to write poems for high school alumni, and gradually became known to each other. Holidays often meet.
Many of the founders of ""Grasshopper"" are trans-language generations, poets from Japanese and Chinese. I first published my work in ""Grasshopper"". In that issue, I also published the ""Poetry Conditions"" in the Japanese poet ""The Modern Poetry"" by Japanese poet Yoshikawa. I said that ""the so-called living in modern times is The three propositions that are forced by A and Cathy: physical suicide, philosophical suicide, and rebellious choices, that is, enthusiasm from rebellion to social aspect, the intellectuals of action have become the most spacious door, becoming a step by step. Approaching the dangerous abyss of new holism."" Touched, copying poems in his own notebook.
The subsequent issue of ""Grasshopper"", Li Kuixian's translation of Georg Ried ""History of Modern German Poetry"", began to be published. In Chapter 2, ""The Disintegration of Value,"" Thomas. Mann debuted, and at the end there was a tribute to him: ""Tomas Mann - the explorer of art and life / between the damage and achievement, a lot of vicissitudes / in the joy of the spirit, for the content of the times In the minds of my thoughts/in the text, I created freedom and serenity, through Japan or through the world's ""Grass"" poet school, in my heart. Then Thomas. Man's Kafka is different from a calm way, full of enthusiastic sympathy, and has a huge impact on modern poetry. In the serial of ""The History of Modern German Poetry"", ""Kafka shaped the anxiety of modern people in the ridiculous world of phenomena. He was rejected, left homeless, and God lost. Kafka accused the institutionalized world. Then, Brecht, ""as a playwright, strongly and steadfastly accused ""greedy"", ""self-satisfied citizens"" and their falsehood of morality.""
Compared to college, my poet school may give me more humanities. In the mid-to-late 1960s, just as the world's post-war baby boomers were rebelling against the system, the atmosphere of the Cold War was shaped by the confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union. I am in the world of poetry to touch these pulsations. After the war, Taiwan was shaped by colonial rule, and the February 28 incident, which was deposited in the shadow of history, was revealed from the conversations of poets across the language generation. It was the year of my birth, the bullet mark on the red wall of the high school classroom I had left, the secret that was inadvertently spoken by a physical education teacher, as if accompanying the secrets of my life, meeting with the historical witnesses, my enlightenment It is also formed through such a meeting.
I later went with Zheng Jun to live in the poet's house in Fengyuan. He is also a novelist who left the Japanese experience of Taiwanese who participated in the Pacific War in Nanyang. In the late 1930s, he attended Taichung No. 1 Middle School. Because he protested the change of the name of the Japanese emperor, he was unable to graduate from the school and his classmates. He was recruited in the name of volunteers in the early 1940s. The days of spending prison camps in the jungles of Java, Indonesia. In the 1940s and my 1960s, he was a transition from youth to society, and it was the age of the 20-year-old generation. My poet's path is related to some common era and generation.
Taiwan in the mid to late 1960s was an era of awakening from the shadow of the white horror era. The ""Grasshopper"" I joined is a local literary publication founded in the same year as ""Taiwan Literature and Art"", with modern poetry novels as the content of the extension. In the same year, the ""Declaration of the Self-rescue Movement of the Taiwan People"" was banned due to the printing process in the printing factory. Professor Peng Mingmin and his two participating students were also arrested and imprisoned. Later, Peng Mingmin was exiled. Going abroad, but the self-rescue movement is going on in different forms. ""Grasshopper"" and ""Taiwan Literature and Art"" symbolize the self-rescue movement of literature.
The shadow is there. The US B52 bomber took off and landed at the Qingquangang Air Force Base and made a trip to the Vietnam War. It caused a loud burst of sound over Taiwan, forming a shadow like the eclipse of the eclipse and obscuring the sun. The shadow of strict punishment was also like the lunar eclipse in the mid to late 1960s. The moonlight of the soul is obscured in the power nightmare of authoritarian politics. Just as the history of the February 28th incident is hidden in people's hearts, just as the white terror of the 1950s is hidden in people's hearts, the feeling of the times still has scars in the generations of my father and my generation. Only the economy of processing exports supports the prosperity of the city street. The neon light flashes in the shops along the road. At night, people often see crowds, sometimes they are also among them. While studying at the university, he also has some copywriting work, while writing a false story about his youthful allergic troubles. Sometimes, I also think of pears in the south, I don't know how she is, she still misses me? Maybe, I have forgotten me!
For the pear flower, I apologize in my heart and feel that I am weak and selfish. I wrote down some memories of her in the notebook, and tried to memorize those years that have passed away in the form of prose or novels. When I re-entered the institutional education and became a college student, I did not get much benefit in school. I have studied history, but there are almost no courses in history philosophy that I love. There are many courses in Chinese history, but there are very few topics on Taiwan’s existence, which is simply ignored. I just want to finish the course quickly, only read my favorite books, cope with the exams, and graduate.
The classmates in the class also felt that I came to the university to come to the door. It was not that I did not study seriously, but that I had my own ideas. In those days, the world's college students were resisting the development system of civilization. The order formed by the US-Soviet confrontation during the Cold War was like a shackle. The youth wanted to break free and full of cracks. I should be such a generation. I have experienced the domestication of the anti-communist national policy of the Cold War in Taiwan. In fact, it is alienated from the world. We have long hair and accept some foreign rock and anti-war songs as popular music. We saw many American soldiers on the street. They came to Taiwan for a holiday from the battlefield in Vietnam. Most of our news reports only saw how the Vietnam War was in the fierce exchange of fire on the battlefield between South Vietnam, North Vietnam and the United States. Taiwan also has unarmed military personnel in South Vietnam. Although it does not directly participate in the warfare regiment of South Korea, it is basically reported in the name of anti-communist, commenting on the situation in Vietnam. Being isolated in Taiwan, which is used by the United States as a Vietnam War supply station, the only rebellion may be the hair of the shoulders. Perhaps this is why the night police banned the young elephants on the streets.
More important than the appearance of long hair, the heart is inside. I began to write some anti-war poems and published them in The Grasshopper. An inexplicable shadow of war, which has been turned into a line, appears in my work. There is a poem ""Relics"" mentioned in the war, which is the work copied in the notebook during that period. Somehow, I wrote this poem from the perspective of women and from the perspective of the survivors.
The hand of the monarch sent from the battlefield, the hand of the king of the war, the hand of the king, the hand of the king who has been expanding my tears, the sharpness of the shrapnel, the stamp of my heart...
After writing the twelfth poem ""Relics"", I wrote many anti-war poems one after another, becoming my poetry in the late 1960s. With women as speakers and coming out of my own allergic poetry, I have a feeling of becoming a poet. Obedience to the warlike experience has made me move from conception to flesh and blood, and it is also a kind of awakening process of mine. In addition to sensation, plus the meaning of criticism, the requiem of my poem seems to be the eclipse of the eclipse of the eclipse, taking advantage of the times.
Walking in the city street in Taichung at night, often when I came out from the cinema, the crowd has gradually decreased. From Green Road to the Zhongzheng Road, I saw the Taichung Railway Station to the left. Go right to the Freedom Road and turn left. Turn right at Minquan Road, turn left at Sanmin Road, pass Taichung Hospital and City Council, and go to the fifth market of Zi Li Street, then go to the residence. At night, one person walks alone, while recollecting the plot of the movie in his mind, thinking about his own life.
At that time, I was fascinated by the movie. Antonioni's ""Eclipse"" was released in the title of ""Spirit of the Sea"". I was outside Di Sijia and realized the poetry of another Italian director. Later I also Wrote an essay of his essay and publish it in the school magazine. Movies and poems are more similar, images and images, and narrative forms. The new wave of France, the name of Chu Fu; the new realism of Italy, I imagined the line of words from the film. Poetry and reality, imagination and experience, black and white and color. A person quietly watches in the cinema, or reads, as if a book of a book has read through the life that I have been eroded by the times.
