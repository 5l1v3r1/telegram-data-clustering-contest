荷蘭迎首架F35A戰機 灑水禮變「泡泡浴」恐受損

02 Nov 2019, 05:22

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】荷蘭此前斥資50億歐元（約56.18億美元），採購46架F35A隱形戰機，取代現役的F16。軍方10月31日接收首架服役的F35A隱形戰機時，並準備灑水禮迎接，不料，消防隊伍誤用滅火泡沫迎接，導致高度敏感的機身及引擎部分遭泡沫覆蓋，暫不知是否受損。
31日下午3時30分左右(當地時間)，大批政府及軍方人員出席在呂伐登空軍基地（Leeuwarden Air Base）迎接儀式，這架F35A在基地上空快速飛行一圈後降落。
從影片畫面可見，當戰機進場時，兩旁消防車開始噴灑，消防車停止噴灑後，戰機機身全是泡沫，而非原定的清水。
荷蘭空軍翌日證實事件，指事後已清洗該架戰機，軍方正與生產商洛歇馬丁合作，檢查會否影響戰機的隱形性能。
據了解，基地的消防隊伍當天稍早，曾處理一宗F16戰機緊急事故，事後竟忘記將泡沫改回清水，結果釀成這次「隱形戰機泡泡浴」事件。

The Netherlands welcomes the first F35A fighter. Sprinkling water and changing the ""bubble bath"" fears damage.

02 Nov 2019, 05:22

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] The Netherlands has spent 5 billion euros (about 5.618 billion US dollars) to purchase 46 F35A stealth fighters to replace the active F16. When the military received the first F35A stealth fighter on October 31, it was ready to greet the sprinklers. Unexpectedly, the fire brigade misled the fire-fighting foam, causing the highly sensitive fuselage and engine parts to be covered by foam. .
At about 3:30 pm on the 31st (local time), a large number of government and military personnel attended the welcoming ceremony at Leeuwarden Air Base. The F35A landed a fast flight over the base and landed.
It can be seen from the film screen that when the fighter plane comes into play, the fire trucks on both sides start to spray, and after the fire truck stops spraying, the fuselage is full of foam instead of the original water.
The Dutch Air Force confirmed the incident on the following day, referring to the fact that the aircraft had been cleaned afterwards. The military is working with producer Loche Martin to check whether it will affect the stealth performance of the aircraft.
It is understood that the firefighting team of the base handled an F16 fighter emergency earlier that day and later forgot to change the bubble back to clean water, resulting in the ""invisible fighter bubble bath"" incident.
