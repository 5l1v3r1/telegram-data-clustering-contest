World Pinball-Playing Record Broken During Gamers' Livestreaming-for-Charity Event
02 Nov 2019, 05:34 by EditorDavid
haaz (Slashdot reader #3,346) tells us that history has just been made as part of the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals annual online game-playing fundraiser, Extra Life: A man from Milwaukee, Wisconsin is trying to play pinball long enough to break the standing Guinness World Record for Longest Marathon Pinball Play of 30 hours 10 minutes. He's using Extra Life's gaming/DIY fundraising site to webcast his attempt and raise money for Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. He gets a five minute break every hour, and yes, he's wearing an adult diaper. Just minutes ago on Twitter, the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin announced he'd beaten the record. And lots of other fundraising game-playing marathons are happening around the world today, including one in Canada -- and many of them are being streamed online.The event began in 2008, and over the last four years has raised close to $10 million each year. As one gaming site put it, ""Let's help the future programmers of our cyborg overlords fulfill their mission by streaming some video games for the kids this weekend!""

Football: Sloppy PSG beaten by Dijon in Ligue 1

02 Nov 2019, 05:56

PARIS: Paris St Germain suffered their third Ligue 1 defeat of the season when they wasted a one-goal lead to lose 2-1 at lowly Dijon on Friday (Nov 1).
Kylian Mbappe put the leaders ahead in the 19th minute before Dijon struck back with goals by Mounir Chouiar and Jhonder Cadiz to get a deserved victory.

PSG have 27 points from 12 games and lead second-placed Nantes, who travel to Girondins de Bordeaux on Sunday, by eight points.
Dijon, who have 12 points, are now 18th after starting the game at the bottom of the table.
Despite starting with their formidable trio of Mbappe, Mauro Icardi and Angel Di Maria, PSG played too casually and were eventually punished for their sloppiness.
Mbappe opened the scoring when he flicked the ball past Alfred Gomis after collecting a perfect through ball from Di Maria.
Thomas Tuchel's side, however, were caught snoozing on the stroke of halftime as Keylor Navas parried a cross into the path of Chouiar, who pounced on the ball to equalize.
Two minutes into the second half, Cadiz powered his way into the box before slotting the ball between Navasâ€™s legs to put the hosts ahead.
Tuchel replaced midfielder Leandro Paredes with striker Edinson Cavani in the 71st but the Uruguay international did little to show that he could regain his place in the starting line-up at the expense of Icardi.
""It's a big upset, we had a great first half and had the chance to score early in the second half,"" said Dijon captain Julio Tavares.
""We had to be at 200per cent and we were.""
PSG's Marquinhos, wearing the skipper's armband in the absence of the ill Thiago Silva, admitted his side lacked aggression.
""It's football. When you're not present physically, not aggressive enough, that's what happens,"" the Brazilian said.
""We have to bounce back right away, we have to do much better. We should not stay in our comfort zone. We win when we're efficient, in front and at the back.
""We can't play like we did tonight.""
PSG next host Club Brugge in a Champions League group game on Wednesday.
