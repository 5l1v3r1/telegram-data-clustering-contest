      <p>WASHINGTON: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday (Nov 1) that negotiations with North Korea were going too slowly after Pyongyang fired two more short-range projectiles.</p>
      <p>Pompeo downplayed Thursday's launches themselves, saying they were consistent with previous moves, but called for more effort in nuclear negotiations.</p>

      <p>"The progress has been far too slow," Pompeo told radio station KQAM in his home state of Kansas.</p>
      <p>"I'm hopeful that we can continue to work on this project and get a good outcome in the months ahead," he said.</p>
      <p>The South Korean military said the projectiles flew 230 miles (370 kilometres) to the east in North Korea's first known test since October 2, when it carried out a provocative test of a submarine-launched missile.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump has met three times with Kim in hopes of sealing a potentially historic deal on ending North Korea's nuclear program.</p>
      <p>But there has been little concrete commitment and North Korea walked out of working-level talks last month in Sweden.</p>
