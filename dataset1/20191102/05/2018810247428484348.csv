Blizzard Announces Diablo IV
02 Nov 2019, 05:10 by Jason Schreier



Diablo IV is coming, Blizzard said today, finally confirming the much-anticipated sequel after years of speculation.
A new cinematic trailer for the game showed a group of treasure hunters fighting against what could be demons, or private equity executives.



Blizzard says the game takes place “many years after the events of Diablo III, after millions have been slaughtered by the actions of the High Heavens and Burning Hells alike. In the vacuum of power, a legendary name resurfaces.”
This is the fourth mainline entry in the longrunning hack-n-loot series, which began in 1996. The most recent entry, Diablo III, came out in May 2012, recovering from a rocky launch to become one of the most popular PC games of all time.
