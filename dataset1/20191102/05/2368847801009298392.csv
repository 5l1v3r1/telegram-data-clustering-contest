【才子佳人】梁祝的故事 我們讀懂了嗎？

02 Nov 2019, 05:19

風平浪靜後，一道彩虹中，人們看到兩隻美麗的蝴蝶比翼飛舞、形影相隨，飛上了天空，傳說那是梁山伯與祝英台的精魂所化。上天感念他們的情義節烈，賜予二人在天上團聚，結為永世夫妻。於是，人間留下了一段淒婉、動人的愛情故事，千古傳唱。
然而，這個家喻戶曉、耳熟能詳的故事，我們讀懂了嗎？

一見如故 義結金蘭

晉朝的士族小姐祝英台，生得才貌雙絕，不但女紅做得好，還喜讀詩書，從小敬佩班昭、蔡文姬的才學。當她長到十五六歲的時候，看到那些外出求學的男生便心生羨慕，一心嚮往訪師求學。
父親說：「自古哪有女子外出求學的？」英台想出一條大膽妙計：女扮男裝！她千方百計說服了父母。就這樣，她扮成一個清俊瀟灑的公子，丫環扮作書童，離家遠行了……
在一座橋上，她們遇見了比英台大兩歲的布衣書生梁山伯，也是去學館求學的。山伯出身平民，性格忠厚篤誠。二人一見如故，意氣相投，很快就互引為知己，結拜為兄弟，隨後一同上路了。

情深義厚 精神契合

來到學館，他倆被安排住在一個老舊房屋裡。山伯把英台推到有窗子的裡間，笑說他來為大家公子遮風擋雨，然後就坐到桌前埋頭讀書去了。
在學館這個男人世界裡，英台顯得既弱小又出眾。山伯對英台真像對親弟弟那樣，生活上對她照顧得十分周到。學館裡有調皮搗蛋的同學以武力挑戰英台或有同學將力氣活兒推給英台做的時候，山伯就會挺身而出為她解圍、幫她幹重體力活兒，他成為了英台的強大後盾。
他們白天同去講堂聽課，晚上回到宿舍共讀詩書，閒暇時結伴散步賞景，還一道去祭拜孔廟、遊學東吳。兩個人從早到晚有說不完的話，成了最要好的朋友。
英台不喜歡學館中那些桀驁不訓、玩世不恭的同學，也不喜歡個性張揚、做事不考慮別人的公子哥兒，她只喜愛才高學富、溫良忠厚的山伯。
春花秋月，兩人就這樣以兄弟相稱，相互照應、相互提攜，一晃竟同窗三載。

一個克制守德 一個清心寡慾

在朝夕相處的日子裡，英台對山伯漸生愛慕，情感溫婉而深長，卻又無法對他說破。「我祝英台非梁山伯不嫁」，她只能在心裡這樣默默祈禱。
三年之中，在同一屋檐下生活，她並沒有因情愛而亂了心性，始終恪守女德。無論晝夜、寒暑，在寢室以外，英台始終衣不解帶。夏天，人們都換上了單衣，可她還得裡邊女衣、外面男衫，熱得不行。需要換洗衣服或洗澡時，她就帶著丫鬟裝扮成的書童遠遠地避開。山伯雖有時也起疑惑，但均被英台支吾過去。
本性質樸的山伯，也始終像兄友一樣善待、禮遇英台，規規矩矩，從沒有逾禮的舉動，而且他的心思都在學問上，清心寡慾，因此，直至學業完成時，他對英台是女兒身一事竟毫無覺察。

十八里相送

直到有一天，英台收到家書，父親念她已到了成年結婚的年齡，催她返家。
啟程那天，山伯十八里相送，走過一條條路、一座座橋，兩人依依惜別。一路上，英台幾次想向山伯表露情感，卻欲言又止，畢竟那是個不能自許婚姻的時代。她只好借物抒懷，暗示、啟發他。可是，山伯仍渾然不覺，思無他念。
最後，英台只好託詞說：「我家有個與我同胞的九妹，我來說媒嫁與你如何？」山伯一聽便高興地答應了。兩人約定七月七日梁山伯去祝家相親。

一般梁祝傳說的結局：忠義感天地，魂魄化彩蝶

在晉朝那個最講究門第的朝代，梁山伯自認出身寒門，配不上祝家，遲遲沒能前去相親。直到趕考歸來，被任命為縣令，才去祝家造訪。可是延誤了約期，英台的父母已將女兒許配給趙州知府的公子馬文才了。
英台紅妝翠袖、羅扇遮面出來相見，向山伯行側身禮，山伯方才恍然大悟，原來她就是聰明美貌、早已對自己芳心暗許的九妹！
當得知英台將被迫嫁給馬文才後，山伯懊悔至極，英台也萬分傷痛。但是他們懂得，男女之間的情感婚姻，都是過去世因緣的結果，如此陰差陽錯，一定是天命所致。他們不願違逆天意，也不願傷害父母，只能選擇放棄私情，揮淚作別。同時，二人不約而同地暗暗許下心願：「此生不能成婚，但求往生能在一起。」
梁祝淚別後，山伯做了縣令，據說他清正廉潔，因治水積勞成疾；加上他總是追憶與英台讀書時的美好情景，友情、愛情、悔恨交織在一起，憂思過度，不久便英年早逝了。臨終前他囑咐，把他安葬在與英台結拜的地方。人們遵遺願照辦了。
英台出嫁那天，原本風和日麗，乘舟行到冢西的古道附近，突然狂風四起，水面遇大風浪，不能前行。英台問後方知，此處是梁山伯墓所在之地。她執意登岸祭拜。來到山伯的墓前，扶碑失聲慟哭……正在這時，忽然飛沙走石，地面裂陷，英台墜入其中被掩埋。
風平浪靜後，人們看到二隻美麗的蝴蝶在彩虹中從墳上飛起，形影相隨，比翼飛舞於天地之間，傳說那是梁祝兩人的精魂所化。
他們的故事傳開後，人們為梁山伯與祝英台的忠孝仁義及他們之間生死相隨的情誼所感動。晉朝丞相謝安聽到此事後，上奏朝廷，為二人的墓取名為「義婦冢」。

一部不同凡響的正劇：守護神性，天作之合

不過，作者更喜歡2019年神韻晚會上舞蹈「梁祝」那個不同凡響的結局：山伯趕到祝家發現英台竟是個女子，向她表明了愛慕之意。英台也向父母訴說了她對山伯多年的仰慕和堅貞。此時，馬文才等多位富家子弟來上門求婚，都被英台一一婉拒。最終，在天地作證和父母的祝福中，梁祝終結百年之好。
英台與異性山伯朝夕相處三年而克制守德，不失貞節，這是貞；她不嫌山伯貧寒，山伯對她恩義如兄，彼此忠貞不渝，不離不棄，跨越了生與死的界線，這是忠和義；他們的愛情裡沒有金錢和物慾的雜質，完全出於對彼此品德和才華的敬重、敬愛和珍惜，達到了精神上的純粹和極致。
梁祝不因男女私情就忤逆天意、與父母抗命，而寧可自己承受、忍耐思念和離別之苦，這是敬天，是盡孝。
不僅愛情，上天賦予人間的真情都應是如此誠摯、無私、純潔、忠貞的，梁祝守護住了這些上天賦予的美好品性，因此能感天動地。上天看重這樣的生命，於是成全了他們，給了他們一個美好的結局——最終相守相依，不再分離。
梁祝故事的結局不應是悲劇，應該是一部正劇。它蘊含在情感中的中國傳統道德價值，一直會千古傳唱下去。@*#

[才才佳人] The story of Liang Zhu We read it?

02 Nov 2019, 05:19

After the calm sea, in a rainbow, people saw two beautiful butterflies flying around, flying in the sky, legend that it was the essence of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai. Heaven is grateful for their love and affection, and they are given two people to reunite in heaven and become a husband and wife. As a result, the world has left a sly, touching love story, sung in the ages.
However, this well-known and familiar story, have we read it?

Seeing the truth

The Miss Shishi of the Jin Dynasty, Zhu Yingtai, was born with a unique character. Not only did she do a good job, but she also liked to read poetry. She admired the lessons of Ban Zhao and Cai Wenji from an early age. When she was 15 or 6 years old, she saw that the boys who went out to study were envious and bent on visiting the teacher.
The father said, ""Since the ancient times, a woman went out to study?"" Yingtai came up with a bold plan: a woman dressed as a man! She tried every means to convince her parents. In this way, she dressed as a handsome and handsome son, as a bookboy, and traveled away from home...
On a bridge, they met Liang Shanbo, a two-year-old literary scholar who was two years older than Yingtai, and went to the school to study. Shan Bo was born into a civilian, and his character was loyal and pious. When the two met at the same time, they were willing to vote for each other. They soon became confidants and worshipped as brothers. They then went on the road together.

Feelings of deep feelings

When they came to the school, they were arranged to live in an old house. Shan Bo pushed Yingtai into the window, laughing that he would cover the wind and rain for everyone, and then sat down at the table and went to study.
In the men's world of the school, Yingtai appears to be both weak and outstanding. Shan Bo’s true image of Yingtai is like a younger brother. She cares very much about her life. When there are mischievous students in the school to challenge Yingtai by force or when some students push their strengths to Yingtai, Shanbo will come forward to help her out and help her to do heavy physical work. He became English. The powerful backing of Taiwan.
During the day, they went to the lecture hall to listen to the class. In the evening, they went back to the dormitory to read poetry books. When they were in leisure, they went for a walk and enjoyed the scenery. They also went to worship the Confucius Temple and study in Soochow. The two people have become the best friends from the morning to the evening.
Yingtai does not like the unscrupulous and cynical classmates in the school, and does not like the personality of publicity, doing things without considering other people's sons, she only loves the high school and the rich and honest.
Spring flowers and autumn months, the two are so commensurate with each other, mutual care, mutual support, and a burst of three years.

a restraint, a devotion

In the days when they lived together, Yingtai gradually loved Shanbo, and his feelings were warm and deep, but he could not tell him. ""I wish that Yingtai is not married to Liangshanbo."" She can only pray in silence in her heart.
In the past three years, living under the same roof, she did not confuse her heart because of her love, and always adhere to the female virtue. No matter whether it stays up late or in the cold, outside the bedroom, Yingtai always has no clothes. In the summer, people put on a single coat, but she still has a women's clothing inside, a men's shirt outside, not hot enough. When she needs to change her clothes or take a bath, she will avoid the bookboys who are dressed up. Although Shan Bo sometimes had doubts, he was passed by Yingtai.
The simple nature of Shan Bo, who has always been treated like a brother and a friend, courtesy of Yingtai, is a well-behaved, never rude, and his mind is learning, clear-minded, so until the completion of his studies, he I was unaware of the fact that Yingtai was a daughter.

Eighteen miles

Until one day, Yingtai received a book, and her father remembered that she had reached the age of adult marriage and urged her to return home.
On the day of departure, Shan Bo sent eighteen miles and walked through a road and a bridge. Along the way, Yingtai tried to express his feelings to Shanbo several times, but he wanted to stop talking. After all, it was an era in which marriage could not be allowed. She had to borrow things, hint and inspire him. However, Shan Bo still stunned, thinking without him.
In the end, Yingtai had to pretend to say: ""My family has a nine-sister with my compatriots. How do I say that the media is married to you?"" Shanbo agreed with pleasure. The two agreed that Liang Shanbo would like to wish a family date on July 7.

The ending of the legend of Liang Zhuzhu: loyalty and the world, the soul of the butterfly

In the dynasty of the Jin Dynasty, the most esteemed dynasty, Liang Shanbo recognized himself as a cold door, and was not worthy of his family. He was unable to go to blind date. It was not until the return of the exam that he was appointed as a county magistrate. However, due to the delay, the parents of Yingtai have assigned their daughters to Ma Wencai, the son of Zhaozhou Prefecture.
Yingtai red makeup crest sleeves, Luo fan cover face to meet, to Shanbo line sideways ceremony, Shan Bo Fang suddenly realized, she turned out to be smart and beautiful, has long been fascinated by their own nine sisters!
When he learned that Yingtai would be forced to marry Ma Wencai, Shanbo repented, and Yingtai was extremely hurt. But they know that emotional marriage between men and women is the result of past karma, so it is bound to be fatal. They don't want to go against God's will, and they don't want to hurt their parents. They can only choose to give up their private feelings and tear their tears. At the same time, the two men secretly made a wish: ""This life can not be married, but the desire to live together.""
After Liang Zhu’s tears, Shan Bo made a county magistrate. He is said to be clean and honest, because he has always been reminiscing about the beautiful scenes of reading with Yingtai. Friendship, love and remorse are intertwined. Soon after, I died young. He died before his death and buried him in a place to worship with Yingtai. People follow the wishes.
On the day of Yingtai’s marriage, the original wind and the sun, the boat trip to the ancient road near the west, suddenly gusts of wind, the surface of the water encountered a storm, can not move forward. Yingtai asked the latter to know that this is the place where Liang Shanbo’s tomb is located. She insisted on landing on the shore. When I came to the tomb of Shan Bo, the helpless monument was crying... At this moment, suddenly the sand flew away and the ground fell, and Yingtai fell into it and was buried.
After the calm sea, people saw two beautiful butterflies flying in the rainbow from the tomb, shadows and shadows, flying between the heavens and the earth, the legend is that the soul of Liang Zhu and the two.
After their stories spread, people were moved by the loyalty and loyalty of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai and the friendship between them. After hearing the incident, Xie An, the Jin Dynasty, played the court and named the tomb of the two.

An extraordinary drama: the patron saint, the perfect match

However, the author prefers the extraordinary ending of the dance ""Liang Zhu"" at the 2019 Shen Yun party: Shan Bo rushed to Zhu Jia and found that Yingtai was actually a woman, showing her the meaning of love. Yingtai also told her parents about her admiration and determination for Shanbo for many years. At this time, Ma Wencai and many other rich children came to the door to propose marriage, and they were all rejected by Yingtai. In the end, in the testimony of the heavens and the blessings of the parents, Liang Zhu ended the good for a hundred years.
Yingtai and the opposite sex have lived together for three years and restrained the virtues, and they are not guilty. This is awkward; she is not too sorrowful, and Shanbo is loyal to her, and she is loyal to each other, never quit, and lives and dies. The boundaries, this is loyalty and righteousness; there is no impurity of money and material desire in their love, completely out of respect, respect and cherish for each other's character and talent, and achieve spiritual purity and ultimate.
Liang Zhu does not disobey God and disobey his parents because of his temperament, but prefers to bear, endure, and parting. This is Jingtian and filial piety.
Not only love, but the true feelings that Heaven gives to the world should be so sincere, selfless, pure, and loyal. Liang Zhu protects these beautiful qualities endowed by Heaven, and therefore can feel the earth. God valued such a life, so they fulfilled them and gave them a beautiful ending - eventually they will be separated and not separated.
The ending of Liang Zhu’s story should not be a tragedy. It should be a drama. It contains the traditional Chinese moral values in emotions and has been sung for generations. @*#
