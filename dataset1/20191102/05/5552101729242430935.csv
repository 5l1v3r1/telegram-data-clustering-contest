日本喜劇名家三谷幸喜10歲喪父，母親對他的影響很深，甚至連他愛看電影、對表演有興趣，都和母親有關。儘管三谷幸喜早已長大成人，但是與母親一直很親近，甚至天天都會打電話。他曾說，「媽媽是唯一看過我所有作品的地球人。從小時候到現在全都看過，從沒說過不好的地方，都是稱讚，所以我才能變成現在的樣子。」



58歲的三谷幸喜出生於東京田園調布，是家中的獨生子。儘管父親早逝，但他的家境不錯，家庭生活中除了母親，還有祖父母、叔叔、舅舅、阿姨等，因接觸的多半是大人，所以言行舉止也頗有「小大人」的樣子。三谷幸喜84歲高齡的母親日前接受日本電視訪問時透露，三谷幸喜從小就愛看書，零用錢幾乎都拿來買書，房間擺滿推理小說。
此外，媽媽也記得三谷幸喜小學一年級時，她第一次出席小學的教學參觀日，那時教室牆上貼了許多小朋友所寫關於家人的作文，但別人大概只寫一頁，只有三谷幸喜竟然寫了滿滿三張。
三谷幸喜對於舞台劇的熱愛，從小就看出端倪。媽媽說，他小學二年級時做了一個母親節禮物，讓她印象深刻。當時三谷幸喜用各種玩具做出一個場景，裡面放置許多玩偶，還搭配播放《波斯市場》這首曲子，更換各種照明，讓媽媽當場感動得哭了。
三谷幸喜從小喜歡卓別林，小學時媽媽甚至帶他去瑞士旅行，向學校請假15天，希望能見到當時定居瑞士的卓別林。結果卓別林不在家，三谷幸喜就畫了一張畫請對方拿給卓別林。幾個月後，這張畫寄回日本，上面多了卓別林親筆簽名。

Japanese director calls his mother every day. When he is in elementary school, he takes him to Switzerland to see idols.

Japanese comedy famous Miyuki Yuki was mourned at the age of 10, and his mother had a profound influence on him. Even his love of watching movies and interested in performances was related to his mother. Although Sangu Yuki has grown up, he has been very close to his mother and even calls every day. He once said, ""Mom is the only person on earth who has seen all my works. I have seen it since I was a child. I have never said anything bad, it is praise, so I can become what I am.""



The 58-year-old Miyuki Yuki was born in the pastoral setting of Tokyo and is the only child in the family. Despite his early death, his family was a good family. In addition to his mother, his grandparents, uncles, aunts, and aunts in his family life, most of his contacts were adults, so his words and deeds were quite ""small adults."" When Miyazaki’s 84-year-old mother was interviewed by a Japanese TV station, he said that he had loved reading books since childhood, and pocket money was almost always used to buy books. The room was full of mystery novels.
In addition, my mother also remembers the first time in the first grade of Sanki Yuki Elementary School. She attended the teaching tour day of elementary school for the first time. At that time, many children’s essays written by the children were posted on the classroom wall, but others only wrote one page, only Sanki Yuki I actually wrote three full.
Sangu Yuki’s love for stage plays has been seen since childhood. Mom said that he made a Mother's Day gift in the second grade of elementary school, which impressed her. At that time, Sangu was fortunate to use a variety of toys to create a scene in which many dolls were placed, and the song ""Persian Market"" was played, and various lightings were replaced, so that the mother was moved to cry on the spot.
Fortunately, Ichikawa liked Chaplin from a young age. When I was in elementary school, my mother even took him to Switzerland for a trip. I took a 15-day leave from the school, hoping to see Chaplin, who settled in Switzerland at the time. As a result, Chaplin was not at home, and Sangu Yukii drew a picture and asked the other person to take it to Chaplin. A few months later, the painting was sent back to Japan, and there was more autographed by Chaplin.
