PARIS: Paris St Germain suffered their third Ligue 1 defeat of the season when they wasted a one-goal lead to lose 2-1 at lowly Dijon on Friday (Nov 1).

PSG have 27 points from 12 games and lead second-placed Nantes, who travel to Girondins de Bordeaux on Sunday, by eight points.
Dijon, who have 12 points, are now 18th after starting the game at the bottom of the table.
Despite starting with their formidable trio of Mbappe, Mauro Icardi and Angel Di Maria, PSG played too casually and were eventually punished for their sloppiness.
Mbappe opened the scoring when he flicked the ball past Alfred Gomis after collecting a perfect through ball from Di Maria.
Thomas Tuchel's side, however, were caught snoozing on the stroke of halftime as Keylor Navas parried a cross into the path of Chouiar, who pounced on the ball to equalize.
Two minutes into the second half, Cadiz powered his way into the box before slotting the ball between Navas’s legs to put the hosts ahead.
Tuchel replaced midfielder Leandro Paredes with striker Edinson Cavani in the 71st but the Uruguay international did little to show that he could regain his place in the starting line-up at the expense of Icardi.
""It's a big upset, we had a great first half and had the chance to score early in the second half,"" said Dijon captain Julio Tavares.
""We had to be at 200per cent and we were.""
PSG's Marquinhos, wearing the skipper's armband in the absence of the ill Thiago Silva, admitted his side lacked aggression.
""It's football. When you're not present physically, not aggressive enough, that's what happens,"" the Brazilian said.
""We have to bounce back right away, we have to do much better. We should not stay in our comfort zone. We win when we're efficient, in front and at the back.
""We can't play like we did tonight.""
PSG next host Club Brugge in a Champions League group game on Wednesday.

02 Nov 2019, 05:44

Bülent Arınç, a member of the High Advisory Board of the Presidency, said in his statement about the Decree Law: “As I was working as a member of the High Advisory Board with the President of the Republic, there was no criticism or facial disgrace for me. I do not talk to them by asking them these are my ideas. ”
Turkey guest of the third week of Vision Conference organized by the Municipality of Duzce Presidential Advisory Board Member was Bulent Arinc.
The program was held in Düzce Cultural Center with wide participation. The opening speech of the conference, Dr. Mayor of Düzce. Faruk concise, Düzceli the purpose of these meetings have Turkey service with young people, Turkey labor history, sacrifices have made statesmen, artists, writers and journalists, recognizing told that enable them to meet with them.
""He's crazy in America, whatever he does.""
Bülent Arınç said, “How difficult it is for our President to work today, God help him. Peace will think this is the Spring Operations, is crazy in America what is the place if I did, everybody was doing today man that gets her mouth she will think of him you will think you into the EU, or will think this is Russia, Turkey how to overcome economic difficulties within their own terror Believe in how they will fight these are not things to do with money.
You can imagine how difficult it is for a politician to put his or her head in peace and peace and to take the nation further every day. May my Lord help him, and his friends and gradually increase their inheritance and bestow their success. ”
Ihtiyaç A mechanism is needed to distinguish between right and wrong hak
Bulent Arinc said that Turkey's economic achieve their goals do not want to move the internal and external forces said:
""Those who say that Turkey should not be taken outside the EU, France, Germany and began an open struggle with others. Behind the one in Turkey took action. Especially after the 2010 referendum, the AK Party government has just now put into very large target has received 50 percent in Turkey have to avoid it.
The reasons for avoiding this were mostly in the case of travel events and some operations that started before that. That overflow into the streets in Turkey's opposition, I do not mean legitimate opposition. The work of the opposition is already coming to power, they criticize it for coming to power and they can exercise all their legitimate constitutional rights.
But to overtake the street, extreme organizations to use weapons to come to a level that will eliminate the peace and security of society to come to a level showed itself with the trip events. Then we can say that FETÖ, the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization, has now made its name clearly in its courts and has made its appearance as a result of a treacherous coup attempt on July 15, 2016. Turkey suffered a great tragedy that night.
We have martyrs and veterans. those who wanted to change the regime used weapons, bombed the assembly, bombed the complex, bombed the people, more than 250 martyrs, maybe more than 2 thousand wounded. Turkey suffered material and moral damage, but worse than that of a snake appeared and cut the front of Turkey Turkey bred in the bosom.
All of this turned to more security policies. They have had trials, efforts to prevent them, of course, if any extensions of the public were made. Some of my recent speeches are some of the work that the law, the judiciary and the judiciary should do in this process.
Of course, those who directly participate in the coup attempt and support them directly and indirectly must receive the most severe punishments so that the blood of our martyrs is not left. But there is a need for a mechanism that separates the righteous and the unjust from the people who have sympathized with this or not, without even thinking about it in an innocent way.
Arinc said that there were still those who could not say what happened on July 15, “I was sentenced to 4 years and 2 months for a speech I made on the night of Welfare. I was acquitted after 2.5 years. Are there grievances today? there is. I look at the issue both as a lawyer and as a person who experiences events.
Now I ask a person who tells me about his grievance before me. What do you think happened on July 15? If he's gagging, I'm saying this guy has no job. But the lesson of '15 was a treacherous coup attempt in July was therefore a martyr's veterans have suffered great harm Turkey 'he says when I tell you I'm listening.
But believe me, the first isn't much. They still can't tell us what happened on July 15th. They still don't let the elders know they were involved on July 15th.
Then how do we talk about the victimization of these people? Yes they do, but there are those who are really victims. I'm one of these victims. People from my closest people were victimized, but now justice is postponed..
“I hope Davutoglu and Babacan give up their mistakes”
Bulent Arinc, Ahmet Davutoglu and Ali Babacan asked about the establishment of the party asked the question, ""I hope they give up mistakes,"" he said.
Arinc, “Whether Davutoglu, Babacan whether our friends have made politics together. Staying in the AK Party, standing next to the brain of Tayyip as the leader as the leader. You can't do anything else. ‘Sir, let's do what he has a lot of weaknesses, wrongs ... Let's look at myself I have more weaknesses, wrongs.
‘Sir is making a mistake olabilir who could not make a mistake. Let's try to fix if there is error, if there is missing, we will complete. You can't cross me and fight me. We've always stood side by side, telling them why we'll come face to face now. I hope they give up their mistakes. ”
“These are my ideas”
Bülent Arınç, a member of the Presidency JCC, said the following on his Youtube statement regarding the Decree Law:
Dolayı Since I have been working as a member of the High Advisory Board with the President in relation to what has been published for the last two days, there has been no criticism or face-hunger for me.
I don't talk to them by asking them these are my ideas. While we are talking with him and negotiating certain issues, they remain private, as well. Otherwise, I don't talk about the ideas that have become clear in the High Advisory Board. They have privacy. ”
