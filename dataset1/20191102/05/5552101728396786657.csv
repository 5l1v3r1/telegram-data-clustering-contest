混血女星竟是日本首相外孫女　讀了劍橋還是想搞笑
02 Nov 2019, 05:28 by 項貽斐 , 洪偉韜, 李政達
日本名導三谷幸喜新片《失憶的總理大臣》中，雖然沒有影射任何官員、領袖，與日本現任首相安倍晉三交情不錯的男主角中井貴一也不曾和安倍討論，但如果一定要扯上真實的政治人物，那就是該片中飾演翻譯官的女星宮澤艾瑪。因為她的家世很好，外祖父是曾在1991年至1993年擔任日本首相的宮澤喜一。



30歲的宮澤艾瑪是混血兒，外型嬌小甜美，母親是宮澤喜一的長女，父親則是曾擔任美國外交官的Christopher La Fleur。由於父親工作的關係，宮澤艾瑪小時候曾在日本唸書，大學在美國Occidental College專攻宗教學，並在大三時赴英國劍橋大學念書。
宮澤艾瑪從小就對歌唱、表演有興趣，還曾接受長達10年以上的聲音訓練，到大學才中斷。儘管如此，她仍對演藝工作抱持夢想，不斷接觸參與音樂活動。2012年，宮澤艾瑪23歲時決定進入演藝圈發展，當時引起不少人注意，但她面對媒體侃侃而談，也強調宮澤家的家訓就是「自由與獨立」。

在《失憶的總理大臣》中，宮澤艾瑪飾演美國總統木村佳乃身邊的翻譯官，以流利的日語、英語雙語演出，並且一本正經的搞笑。導演三谷幸喜誇讚她的表演很有趣，希望繼續與她合作。
