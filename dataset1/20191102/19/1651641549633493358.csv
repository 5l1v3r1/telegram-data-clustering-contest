Dell has released its list of Black Friday deals to help get the holiday shopping season kickstarted.





Starting with the easy to throw into a carry-on Dell XPS 13 2-in-1, announced only in May this year, the versatile laptops blends together an exceptional user experience and stunning design in their smallest size. The 2-in-1 is available with Intel’s new 10th Gen Core™ processors, letting you easily juggle all your favourite apps while working from your family couch over the holidays.





In addition, the new XPS 13, is beautifully designed and perfect for those binge-watchers or busy mobile pros on the go. The XPS 13 features Dell CinemaColor and Dolby Vision, and an optional 4K Ultra HD InfinityEdge display, for incredible brightness, contrast, and colour to bring those classic holiday films to life. With excellent battery life and the new Killer™ AX1650 (2×2) built on Intel WiFi 6 Chipset, you’ll be equipped to experience seamless streaming and browsing while in flight or on the road to your holiday destination.
