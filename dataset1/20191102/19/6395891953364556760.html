      <p><b>AMHERST, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - Stephen Calvert passed for 474 yards and four touchdowns and Frankie Hickson added three scoring runs as Liberty overpowered Massachusetts 63-21 on Saturday in a game between independent programs.</p>
      <p>Liberty (6-3) took control of the game in the first quarter. Hickson capped a game-opening drive with a 7-yard touchdown run. The Minutemen were forced to punt on their first drive, but DJ Stubbs fumbled and Isaiah Rodgers recovered the ball, giving UMass a first-and-10 at the Liberty 16. Cam Roberson ran it in from there to knot the score at 7.</p>
      <p>It took the Flames three plays to regain the lead for good. Calvert connected with Joshua Mack for a 62-yard gain on second down and freshman quarterback Brandon Robinson stepped in and tossed his first career TD pass, a 5-yarder to Troy Henderson. Calvert stretched the Flames' lead to 14 with a 31-yard scoring strike to Demario Douglas with 1:36 left in the second quarter. After Liberty forced a three-and-out, Calvert needed just two plays to make it 28-7 - hitting Antonio Gandy-Golden for a 60-yard TD with 2 seconds left.</p>
      <p>Hickson, who finished with 99 yards on 14 carries, had two third-quarter TD runs for Liberty. Calvert connected on 20 of 27 passes without an interception. Gandy-Golden had six catches for 137 yards.</p>
      <p>Andrew Brito completed 16 of 27 passes for 134 yards and two touchdowns for the Minutemen.</p>
