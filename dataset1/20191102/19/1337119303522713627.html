      <h1>Microsoft unveils new Edge browser logo that no longer looks like Internet Explorer</h1>
      <h2>The new icon is a wave surfing the web</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T19:22:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 19:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren" target="_blank">Tom Warren</a></address>
      <p>Microsoft is refreshing the logo for its Chromium-based Edge browser. The software giant originally unveiled its Edge icon more than four years ago, and it’s fair to say it was a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/29/8516339/microsoft-edge-logo-build-2015">logo that clinged to the past of Internet Explorer</a>. Microsoft’s new logo was discovered as part of a new surfing mini game hidden inside the latest Canary versions of Edge. It looks like a wave, and includes a similar Fluent Design style to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/29/18117580/microsoft-office-new-icons-2018-design-features">company’s new Office icons</a>.</p>
      <p>The logo also spells out the letter e, but it no longer looks similar to Internet Explorer, and looks a lot more modern as a result. Microsoft is clearly breaking from tradition here with its move to a Chromium version of Edge, and it will be interesting to hear why the company picked this particular design.</p>

      <p>The Edge icon was revealed in an elaborate Easter Egg hunt where Microsoft employees posted cryptic clues to a series of puzzles and images. Puzzle solvers even had to render an Edge icon as a 3D object, thanks to Obj model code that was hidden in an image. It all led to a series of words discovered in seven clues, which were then inputted into a Javascript function on Microsoft’s Edge Insider website. This revealed which words needed to be pulled from a video for the final instructions to discover the secret surfing game (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/2/20944341/about:blank">edge://surf/</a>) and the new logo when you complete it.</p>
      <p>The secret edge surfing game is very similar to SkiFree, a classic skiing game that was released as part of Microsoft’s Entertainment Pack 3 for Windows back in 1991. You use WASD on a keyboard to navigate around, avoiding obstacles or threatening octopus tentacles and picking up speed boost and shields on the way.</p>
      <p>We’re now waiting to hear when Microsoft will release a final version of its Edge Chromium browser. The software maker released a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/20/20813510/microsoft-chromium-edge-beta-download-release-macos-windows">beta version back in August</a>, and a stable version appeared on the web recently. Microsoft is holding its Ignite conference in Orlando next week, and given the new logo reveal it’s likely we’ll hear more about a release date very soon.</p>
