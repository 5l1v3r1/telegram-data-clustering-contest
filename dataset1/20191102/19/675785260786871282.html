      <h1>Sadio Mane's relentless talent is thankfully more accomplished than his terrible theatrics</h1>
      <h2>The Senegalese should both aspects of his game once again as Liverpool came from behind to beat Aston Villa</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T19:31:07+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 19:31</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Dunn, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>It is a good job Sadio Mane’s football is a lot more accomplished than his diving.</p>
      <p>And that is pretty darn good, don’t forget.</p>
      <p>Remember the match-winning penalty his spectacular collapse earned at Anfield against Leicester at the start of last month?</p>
      <p>In a thunderously good contest at Villa Park, he was it at again although he was not at his most convincing in that department.</p>
      <p>More of that later.</p>
      <p>But there was nothing fake, nothing false, nothing phoney about another outstanding individual footballing display from a player who churns them out with startling regularity.</p>

      <p>He is a player of such relentless intelligence, it is a shame he cannot resist the pull of the theatrics.</p>
      <p>The dart towards Trent Alexander-Arnold’s added-time corner was typically bright, the headed execution brilliant.</p>
      <p>Such is the eye-catching excellence of Mane with the ball at his feet, it is so easy to forget his aerial prowess even though there is a thick catalogue of evidence.</p>
      <p>This was a beauty to win a game that looked to be slipping away from Liverpool until Mane – who else? – sent over a late, deep, beautiful cross and Andrew Robertson headed an equaliser.</p>
      <p>No wonder Mane was paraded as the hero in front of the delirious travelling support.</p>
      <p>And they will not be concerned by his reputation for tumbling but maybe it is time for Jurgen Klopp to have a word.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Mane is on his way to trademarking the just-been-electrocuted move to the deck, his latest execution coming when Frederic Guilbert brushed his back. Really lovely guy, really wonderful footballer, but a diver.</p>
      <p>At least Jon Moss was not hoodwinked, although if any top-flight referee had bought this particular parody of a <br/>tumble, we really would be in serious trouble.</p>
      <p>But however comparatively trivial you consider a failed Mane plunge to be, it renders managers’ complaints about <br/>officialdom and VAR pretty much redundant.</p>
      <p>Whinge about this, whinge about that, but say nothing about your own players’ systematic attempts to con referees.</p>
      <p>So if you are what seems to be the wrong end of a suspect VAR decision, tough.</p>
      <p>The ruling out of Roberto Firmino’s first-half effort gained instant notoriety thanks to the Premier League’s official explanation that the Brazilian’s armpit had strayed offside.</p>

      <p>But the ­assistant referee had flagged, it was a close call and it went the way of the defending side. As they can do. So why the big deal?</p>
      <p>And as for this nonsense about taking the emotion out of the game, give me strength.</p>
      <p>There was a fair old roar when Trezeguet knocked in Villa’s goal and the same fair old roar when VAR confirmed it was legal.</p>
      <p>That is double the emotion in my book. VAR giving VFM. What’s not to like?</p>
      <p>Seriously, there is clearly a debate to be had on VAR but it was a fairly spurious topic here.</p>
      <p>This was a cracking occasion and while the manner of the defeat was cruel on a Villa who defended magnificently and broke with great purpose, it was certainly not an ill-deserved win for Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Quite simply, they are a team who have forgotten how to lose in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>And while Klopp is right to wonder if his resources will <br/>become stretched as the fixture demands grow, he still has players who can make an impact from the bench.</p>
      <p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, in particular, and Divock Origi made a difference as Liverpool chased the game with their non-stop ­invention.</p>
      <p>But Mane was the main man again. He really is a player to ­savour. And if he could cut out those theatrics, he would be even more of a player to ­savour.</p>
