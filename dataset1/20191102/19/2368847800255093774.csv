四中全會釋信號 中共擬3招「管治」香港

02 Nov 2019, 19:40

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】中共四中全會公報稱對香港澳門「依法實行管治」，中共官員續解釋「加強香港法治」，釋放出繼續強硬打壓港人抗爭的信號。港媒總結，依照《基本法》，中共有三方面「法律工具」收緊管控，包括在香港實施大陸法律。
10月31日發佈的四中全會公報稱，要依照《憲法》和《基本法》對港澳「實行管治」，並要「建立健全特別行政區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制」。次日，中共人大常委會港澳基本法委員會主任沈春耀，在四中新聞發佈會上進一步解釋稱，「要完善中央對特別行政區行政長官和主要官員的任免制度和機制」以及「全國人大常委會對基本法的解釋制度」，「行使憲法和基本法賦予中央的各項權力」。
有親中港媒文章引述香港亞太研究中心秘書長李風表示，北京在重要文件中做出如此敘述，下一步肯定會落實行動。文章分析，北京方面或將用盡《基本法》賦予的權力，以圖扭轉當前的局勢。當局可能有如下三個方向：
一是在香港實施部分大陸法令。
香港《基本法》18條規定，「全國人民代表大會常務委員會決定宣布戰爭狀態，或因香港特別行政區內發生香港特別行政區政府不能控制的危及國家統一或安全的動亂，而決定香港特別行政區進入緊急狀態，中央人民政府可發佈命令將有關全國性法律在香港特別行政區實施」。
自香港反送中以來，官方輿論曾威脅在香港實施「緊急狀態」，但目前尚未有此跡象。不過，港首林鄭月娥已經動用了香港的《緊急法》，宣布禁止港人蒙面。此外，當局已下令禁止在網絡社區「煽動暴力」，此舉被外界批評為「變相禁網」。
二是由中共人大再次「釋法」。
《基本法》第8章規定，《基本法》的解釋權屬於中共全國人大常務委員會。此前，中共多次「釋法」加深香港和北京的矛盾，其中包括「解釋」立法會議員的宣誓，結果多名民主派議員的資格被法庭強行剝奪。
沈春耀在記者會上提出了北京方面對「一國兩制」的底線，包括不容忍「分裂國家、危害國家安全」等。他還提出了「完善中央對特別行政區行政長官和主要官員的任免制度和機制」。
《基本法》中對「一國兩制」和特首任免已有詳細的規定。北京要改動，可能需要人大通過所謂「解釋《基本法》」來實現。
日前曾傳出消息稱，北京打算明年3月前另外指定「臨時行政長官」替換林鄭。而依據《基本法》，港首提前卸任時，應由現任政務司長代理港首。
三是再推「23條立法」。
《基本法》23條，要求港府自行立法禁止「叛國、分裂國家、煽動叛亂、顛覆中央人民政府及竊取國家機密的行為」。該條款在《基本法》立法時，因為引發巨大爭議而被擱置。2003年，中共曾強推「23條立法」，結果引發50萬港人上街抗議，港府被迫將立法無限期延後。
近年來，香港親共派時常放出再推「23條立法」的風聲，不斷挑動港人神經，但從未真正實施。不過，今年四中全會公報明確要求特區建立「維護國家安全的法律」，被視為重推「23條立法」的信號。
時事評論員林和立對《蘋果日報》表示，估計「23條立法」已經提上日程，一年內就會推出。他進一步推測，一旦特首林鄭月娥明年3月下台，新任特首的首要任務就是推動「23條立法」。

The Fourth Plenary Session of the National Committee of the Communist Party of China

02 Nov 2019, 19:40

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] The Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party stated that it would ""administer governance according to law"" to Hong Kong and Macao. The CCP officials continued to explain ""strengthening the rule of law in Hong Kong"" and released a signal to continue toughly suppress Hong Kong people's resistance. According to the Hong Kong media, in accordance with the Basic Law, the three ""legal tools"" of the Chinese government have tightened control, including the implementation of mainland laws in Hong Kong.
The Fourth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China issued on October 31 stated that it is necessary to ""administer governance"" to Hong Kong and Macao in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law, and to ""establish a sound legal system and enforcement mechanism for special administrative regions to safeguard national security."" The next day, Shen Chunyao, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Basic Law Committee of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Congress, further explained at the press conference of the Fourth China Central Committee that ""the system and mechanism for the appointment and removal of the chief executive and principal officials of the special administrative region should be improved"" and the ""National People's Congress Standing Committee on the Basic Law."" ""The system of interpretation"", ""Exercising the Constitution and the Basic Law to give the Central Powers.""
A pro-China-Hong Kong media article quoted Li Feng, secretary-general of the Hong Kong Asia-Pacific Research Center, as saying that Beijing has made such a statement in important documents and will definitely implement the next step. The article analyzes that Beijing will exhaust the powers conferred by the Basic Law in an attempt to reverse the current situation. The authorities may have the following three directions:
The first is to implement some civil laws in Hong Kong.
Article 18 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong stipulates that ""the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress decides to declare the state of war, or decides that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region enters a state of emergency because of the unrest in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region that is beyond the control of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, which threatens the unification or security of the country. The Central People's Government may issue an order to implement the relevant national laws in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.""
Since the reversal of Hong Kong, official public opinion has threatened to implement a ""state of emergency"" in Hong Kong, but this is not yet the case. However, Hong Kong Shoulin Zheng Yuexi has used Hong Kong's ""Emergency Law"" to announce the ban on Hong Kong people's masking. In addition, the authorities have ordered a ban on ""inciting violence"" in the online community. This has been criticized by the outside world as ""disguised ban.""
Second, the Chinese People's Congress once again ""interpreted the law.""
Chapter 8 of the Basic Law stipulates that the power to interpret the Basic Law belongs to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the Communist Party of China. Earlier, the CCP repeatedly ""interpreted the law"" to deepen the contradiction between Hong Kong and Beijing, including ""interpreting"" the oath of the Legislative Council members. As a result, the qualifications of many democratic members were forcibly deprived by the court.
At the press conference, Shen Chunyao raised the bottom line of ""one country, two systems"" in Beijing, including intolerance of ""dividing the country and endangering national security."" He also proposed ""improving the central government's system and mechanism for the appointment and removal of chief executives and principal officials of the Special Administrative Region.""
The Basic Law has detailed provisions on ""one country, two systems"" and the appointment and removal of chief executives. If Beijing wants to change, it may need to be implemented by the NPC through the so-called ""interpretation of the Basic Law.""
A few days ago, it was reported that Beijing intends to replace Lin Zheng with the appointment of ""Interim Chief Executive"" before March next year. According to the Basic Law, when the head of Hong Kong leaves early, he should be the head of the current administration.
The third is to push ""23 legislation.""
Article 23 of the Basic Law requires the Hong Kong Government to legislate to prohibit ""the act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion of the Central People's Government and the stealing of state secrets."" This clause was put on hold during the legislation of the Basic Law because of the huge controversy. In 2003, the Chinese Communist Party once pushed ""23 legislations"", which resulted in 500,000 Hong Kong people protesting on the streets. The Hong Kong Government was forced to postpone the legislation indefinitely.
In recent years, the pro-Communist factions in Hong Kong have often released the voice of ""23 legislations"", which has constantly provoked the people of Hong Kong, but they have never actually implemented them. However, the communique of the Fourth Plenary Session of this year explicitly requires the SAR to establish a ""law for safeguarding national security"", which is seen as a signal to re-introduction of ""23 legislation.""
Current affairs commentator Lin Heli told Apple Daily that the ""23 legislations"" have been put on the agenda and will be launched within one year. He further speculated that once the Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue stepped down in March next year, the first task of the new Chief Executive is to promote ""23 legislation.""
