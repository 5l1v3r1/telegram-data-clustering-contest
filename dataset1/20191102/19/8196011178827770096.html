      <p>St Michael’s 3-15 - 2-7 Goleen</p>
      <p>St Michael’s produced a dominant second quarter to set themselves on the way to victory in Saturday evening’s county JBFC (inter-divisional) final at Páirc Uí Rinn.</p>
      <p>While Michael’s trailed by 1-1 to 0-3 in the early stages, David Hurley’s 15th-minute converted free set in motion an unanswered 1-6 to send them into the second half well in control. Two more goals in the ten minutes after half-time ensured that victory would be going to the city club, who gained some measure of consolation after last week’s Premier IFC final loss to Éire Óg.</p>
      <p>Michael’s had early points from Eoin Smith and Kevin O’Keeffe, but Goleen led thanks to Michael O’Reilly’s goal and Tadhg Cullinane’s point answered Diarmuid Crowley’s equaliser.</p>
      <p>However, wides were costly for Goleen in the first half and Michael’s took advantage with their scoring burst, Paul Cronin with a goal in the 20th minute to put them 1-6 to 1-1 ahead and by half-time it was 1-9 to 1-2.</p>
      <p>A point from Michael O’Halloran extended the lead on the resumption before Hurley set Smith up for a goal and, though Pádraig Reidy had a Goleen point in reply, Hurley made it 3-10 to 1-3 on 38 with a fine finish.</p>
      <p>Cullinane did pull a goal back for Goleen and he and Patrick Scully had points as the gap was reduced to eight. However, a point from sub Michael Mulconry steadied Michael’s again and Hurley and O’Keeffe had late points as they won by 11.</p>
