      <h1>Wasps find their sting as Shields and Robson sink Bath</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T19:51:31+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 19:51</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Second-half tries from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/wasps/players/brad-shields/">Brad Shields</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/wasps/players/dan-robson/">Dan Robson</a> saw <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/wasps">Wasps</a> edge out <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath">Bath</a> 30-22 as they earned their first win of the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership">Gallagher Premiership</a> season.</p>
      <p>The two sides traded blows as <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/wasps/players/will-rowlands/">Will Rowlands</a> scored moments before half-time and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath/players/zach-mercer/">Zach Mercer</a> returned the favour five minutes after the interval in a ding-dong battle at the Ricoh Arena.</p>
      <p>But Shields and Robson, who both narrowly missed out on playing a part in England’s World Cup campaign, crossed in the second half to seal the spoils.</p>
      <p>Dai Young’s side bounced back from successive defeats in the first two games of the season, while Bath missed out on a losing bonus point despite the boot of Rhys Priestland.</p>
      <p>Wasps struggled with discipline early on, conceding two penalties as Priestland got the scoring under way with a simple penalty.</p>
      <p>The hosts broke through as <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/wasps/players/sione-vailanu/">Sione Vailanu</a> gained ground with a powerful run, but Shields knocked on 10 metres from the line and Priestland punished them from the tee to make it 6-3.</p>
      <p>Wasps struck at the perfect time, Robson drifting into space and offloading to Rowlands, who rumbled in from 15 metres out, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/wasps/players/lima-sopoaga/">Lima Sopoaga</a> converting to earn a 13-9 half-time lead.</p>
      <p>Seven minutes after the interval Bath stole a lineout and piled on the pressure, Mercer finishing off a long move from close range and Priestland adding the extras to hand the visitors a six-point lead.</p>
      <p>Bath grasped the initiative as Priestland chalked up another three from in front of the posts, but it was from then on that the hosts were jolted into action.</p>
      <p>Sopoaga orchestrated the move and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/wasps/players/zach-kibirige/">Zach Kibirige</a> did well to keep the Kiwi’s floated pass in play out wide, but Shields showed his strength to power over, helped by Vailanu.</p>
      <p>It took just seven minutes for Wasps to do it again and Sopoaga came to the fore, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/wasps/players/tom-cruse/">Tom Cruse</a> finding space and advancing within metres of the line, offloading to Robson for the score.</p>
      <p>Priestland turned the contest in the closing moments with a 70-metre kick that earned Bath territory, and he brought his side within five points on the final play.</p>
      <p>Despite a clean break from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath/players/aled-brew/">Aled Brew</a>, Wasps held on and Sopoaga kicked a penalty in the closing moments to deny Bath anything to show for their visit to the West Midlands.</p>
