      <p>A man in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/arizona">Arizona</a> dressed up in a Jesus <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2019s-halloween-costumes-were-some-of-the-best-and-wildest-so-far">costume</a>, handing out bread to the homeless, has become instant internet gold.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/viral">video </a>that has amassed millions of views on Twitter, the man, identified as Daniel Graham according to <a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/thank-you-jesus-man-rocks-jesus-christ-costume-on-mill-avenue-gives-bread-to-homeless-man">Fox 10 Phoenix</a>, wears a white robe while riding down a street on a motorized skateboard made to look like he’s floating on a cloud straight out of heaven.</p>
      <p>As he makes his way down the sidewalk, Graham, holding a loaf of bread, maneuvers toward a homeless man sitting on a cardboard box with a sign that read, “Food?”</p>
