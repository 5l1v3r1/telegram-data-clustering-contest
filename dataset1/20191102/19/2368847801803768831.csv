開槍港警化名受訪:政客應做更好 支持獨立調查

02 Nov 2019, 19:36

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】香港爆發反送中抗爭運動以來，警方濫用暴力不斷升級，多位警察更開槍射擊實彈。日前一名曾開槍警員在警總接受彭博社訪問，稱事後被示威者起底，生活嚴重受影響。他表示對於「五大訴求」而言，只要調查範圍夠廣泛，進行「獨立調查是合理」。同時還表示理解示威者向警員叫罵，並非針對警察，只是「表達對政府的憤怒」。
據彭博社報導，該名受訪警察化名「Jacky」，他回顧當天開槍情形稱，當時警察和示威者衝突愈演愈烈，他本人及同事壓力極大，他的小隊在長達幾小時的清場過程中已經使用海綿彈、布袋彈、胡椒噴霧及催淚彈等非致命武器，但仍然無法控制場面。在一個衝突激烈的場合，他拔槍發射了一枚實彈。他辯解說：「那是我第一次有這種感覺——不是我一定會死，而是我和我的小隊會發生事情。那是我當時一定要做的事。」
報導稱，示威者對日益嚴重的警察暴力本已忍無可忍，此次開槍事件無疑為局勢火上澆油。Jacky開槍後迅即被知情人起底，個人及家人資料都在網上全曝光。他聲稱，自己在事發後兩日即收到多個匿名警告電話，甚至傳出網上有人懸紅50萬元，要他償命。他開始感到恐慌，很快搬出警察宿舍住到安全地點，之後三週不敢外出。
Jacky稱自己「很後悔最後影響了我女兒。」他說女兒在學校的書桌被塗黑破壞，再也沒有回校。他坦言被起底後，對他帶來的精神影響，比起在街上面對示威者更加痛苦，「我不知道我們的社會為何變成這個樣子」。
報導說，Jacky目前正在休假，而警方在強大輿論壓力下亦開始調查他開槍一事。為免再被起底曝光，他特別要求報道時刪去開槍當晚的細節。
當記者提及五大訴求，包括成立獨立調查委員會調查警方暴力及濫權等話題，Jacky承認，只要調查方向不是只單獨針對警員，他不反對。他並強調「獨立調查是合理的」，但調查範圍「一定要廣泛」。
對於當前警方與示威者之間日益對立的狀況，Jacky表示港府應承擔更多責任，他指政治人物在處理問題時應該要做得更好，他最後舉例說︰「我一直提醒我組的初級警員，他們（示威者）或會向你指罵，但技術上來說他們其實不是在罵你，而是在罵政府以及表達他們對政府的憤怒」。

Shotgun Hong Kong police pseudonymous interview: politicians should do better support independent investigation

02 Nov 2019, 19:36

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] Since the anti-delivery campaign in Hong Kong, the abuse of violence by the police has escalated, and many police officers have fired live ammunition. A police officer who had shot a gunman was interviewed by Bloomberg in the police headquarters. He said that after the incident, the demonstrators began to take the stage and their lives were seriously affected. He said that for the ""five major demands"", as long as the scope of the investigation is wide enough, it is reasonable to conduct an ""independent investigation."" At the same time, it also expressed that the demonstrators yelled at the police officers, not against the police, but ""expressing the anger against the government.""
According to Bloomberg News, the policeman named ""Jacky"" recalled that the shooting of the police on the same day said that the conflict between the police and the demonstrators was intensifying. He and his colleagues were under great pressure. His team was in the process of clearing up for several hours. Non-lethal weapons such as sponges, bag bombs, pepper sprays and tear gas have been used, but the scene is still out of control. In a highly conflicting situation, he fired a live ammunition. He argued: ""That was the first time I felt this way - not that I will die, but that something happens to me and my team. That was something I must do at the time.""
The report said that the demonstrators had been intolerant of the growing police violence. The shooting incident undoubtedly fueled the situation. Jacky was immediately informed by the insider, and personal and family information was fully exposed online. He claimed that he received several anonymous warning calls two days after the incident, and even that someone on the Internet was hanging 500,000 yuan, asking him to pay. He began to panic and soon moved out of the police quarter to live in a safe place, and did not dare to go out three weeks later.
Jacky said that she ""repented and finally affected my daughter."" He said that his daughter was blackened at the school desk and never returned to school. He said that after being bottomed, the spiritual impact on him was more painful than facing the demonstrators on the street. ""I don't know why our society has become like this.""
The report said that Jacky is currently on vacation, and the police began investigating his shooting under pressure from powerful public opinion. In order to avoid being exposed again, he specifically requested to delete the details of the night of the shooting.
When the reporter mentioned five major demands, including the establishment of an independent investigation committee to investigate police violence and abuse of power, Jacky admitted that as long as the investigation direction is not solely directed at police officers, he does not object. He also stressed that ""independent investigations are reasonable"", but the scope of the investigation ""must be broad.""
Regarding the current confrontation between the police and the demonstrators, Jacky said that the Hong Kong Government should take more responsibility. He said that politicians should do better when dealing with problems. He finally said, ""I always reminded me of the group. Junior police officers, they (the demonstrators) may point you to you, but technically they are not jealous of you, but are blaming the government and expressing their anger against the government.""
