      <p>Fianna Fáil has called on the Minister for Communications to explain why Northern Ireland's broadband scheme could cost half the price of the National Broadband plan in the south.</p>
      <p>Fianna Fáil spokesperson for Communications Jack Chambers says Granahan McCourt, the preferred bidder for the contract in the Republic, is also bidding for the Northern Irish Project Stratum.</p>
      <p>He claims the National Broadband Plan is expected to cost about $5,000 per household while Project Stratum would cost about €1,900 for a similar product from the same provider.</p>
      <p>Deputy Chambers says the Government has questions to answer.</p>
      <p>"Why is the government continuing to roll on with this preferred bidder?"</p>
