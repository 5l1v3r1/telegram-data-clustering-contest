      <h1>Connacht too strong for Ospreys in Guinness PRO14</h1>

      <p>Connacht took advantage of a weakened and out-of-form <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/ospreys">Ospreys</a> with a 20-10 Guinness PRO14 victory at a rain-lashed Liberty Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Irish side were indebted to tries from wing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/connacht/players/niyi-adeolokun/">Niyi Adeolokun</a> and centre <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/connacht/players/peter-robb/">Peter Robb</a>, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/connacht/players/conor-fitzgerald/">Conor Fitzgerald</a> kicking 10 points.</p>
      <p>Ospreys, who have won only one of their five games in Conference A, grabbed a second-half try through hooker <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/ospreys/players/sam-parry/">Sam Parry</a> with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/ospreys/players/luke-price/">Luke Price</a> kicking a penalty.</p>
      <p>South Africa lock <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/lions/players/marvin-orie/">Marvin Orie</a> made his Ospreys debut after the three-times capped Springbok was signed on loan from Johannesburg-based side the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/lions">Lions</a> until 26 December.</p>
      <p>Orie’s arrival allowed captain <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/ospreys/players/dan-lydiate/">Dan Lydiate</a> to revert to his preferred back-row role.</p>
      <p>Number eight <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/ospreys/players/dan-baker/">Dan Baker</a> returned in place of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/hurricanes/players/gareth-evans/">Gareth Evans</a> from the side beaten 28-12 in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster">Munster</a> last weekend.</p>
      <p>Connacht centre Tom Farrell made his first start of the campaign following his two-try display off the bench during last weekend’s win over the Cheetahs.</p>
      <p>Connacht dominated a dreadfully organised Ospreys side and the Irish province deserved their 17-3 interval lead.</p>
      <p>Ospreys did open the scoring on four minutes with a Price penalty, but they offered very little after that in the Swansea rain.</p>
      <p>A minute later Ospreys conceded a very soft try when wing Adeolokun ran free up the right touchline, kicked ahead and regathered possession over the line. Fitzgerald converted.</p>
      <p>With the Ospreys penalty count mounting Fitzgerald found the target with a penalty goal on 17 minutes.</p>
      <p>And from 10-3 down it got worse for Ospreys when captain Lydiate was sin-binned for a professional foul on his own try line.</p>
      <p>Down to 14 men, Ospreys conceded a second try when centre Robb was put over under the posts after number eight <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/connacht/players/paul-boyle/">Paul Boyle</a> fed him off the base of a scrum.</p>
      <p>Ospreys made a significant change at half-time, bringing on former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> fly-half <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/ospreys/players/james-hook/">James Hook</a> for Price.</p>
      <p>The home performance improved, and they scored a try on 56 minutes when hooker Parry squeezed in at the right corner from a line-out drive. Hook converted to reduce the deficit to seven points.</p>
      <p>But a Fitzgerald penalty five minutes later as Ospreys edged offside gave <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/connacht">Connacht</a> a 10-point cushion they were not to relinquish as the home side failed to score again.</p>
      <p>With the last kick of the match Ospreys full-back Cai Evans missed a long-range penalty shot which would have given them a losing bonus point.</p>
