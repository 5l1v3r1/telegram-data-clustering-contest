      <p>The four-day festival involves fasting and the offering of ‘Jal’ or, holy river water to the setting Sun at dusk on the third day and to the rising Sun at dawn on the following day. Women fast for all these days during which they are forbidden to have even a sip of water or food for at least two days.</p>

      <p>They keep arranging things and lighting the earthen lamps (Diyas) at the Ghats (river banks), just a few hours ahead of offering “Aragh” (water) to the rising sun on Yamuna saying...’Bolo Chhathi Mayi ki Jai’(praise to the Goddess Chhatti). It is believed that such worship brings luck and helps to make wishes come true.</p>
