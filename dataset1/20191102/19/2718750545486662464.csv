Are These Two British Bake Off Sweeties Dating?
02 Nov 2019, 19:55 by Bridget Read
If you need one pure thing to cling to today, let it be that two sweet season-six Great British Bake Off (or Great British Baking Show here in the U.S.) contestants might be dating. Yes, Michael Chakraverty and Henry Bird, who both competed this year on the world’s most palliative reality show, are possibly now a couple. The rumors come from social media, naturally, after the bakers’ co-star, Alice Fevronia, a geography teacher with very nice hair, posted a photo on her stories of the two of them looking cozy with the caption “BAE-ke Off.”



Okay, but what about this cutie post from Michael on Twitter congratulating Henry’s run on the show with Salt-N-Pepa lyrics? Getting stronger … 



When Michael left, Henry called him “one of the finest of men,” which seems like a pretty British way to possibly say, “We’re dating.” (Or they’re not.) 



But what about this post that Henry made with screenshots of the two of them hugging on the show? Under which the subtitles read “THEY GROAN”?



Or this one from Fevronia on Instagram way back in September, which says, “But how many couples can you see” under a photo of Henry kissing Michael on the cheek? 



The bakers in question have yet to confirm or deny rumors. Yet, anyway.
