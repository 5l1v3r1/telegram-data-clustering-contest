      <h1>Maryland county exec bans police station from displaying 'divisive' 'thin blue line' flag</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T19:12:03+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 19:12</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Gearty</a></address>
      <p>A county executive in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/maryland">Maryland</a> has banned a police station from displaying a wooden “thin blue line” flag that was a gift from a local resident.</p>
      <p>"The flag provides a symbol of support to some but it is a symbol of dismissiveness to others,” <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/maryland-montgomery-county-police-officer-shot-parking-garage">Montgomery County</a> Executive Marc Elrich said in a note. “Because it is divisive, the flag will not be posted at the 5th District nor in any public space within the Police Department."</p>
      <p>The flag, a gift to the 5th District officers from Montgomery County woodworker James Shelton, is labeled by some as a "blue lives matter" flag in response to the "Black Lives Matter" movement.</p>

      <p>A photo on the Montgomery County Police twitter page Wednesday shows Shelton and his young son presenting the artwork to three uniformed officers.</p>
      <p>"Thank you to resident James Shelton, who presented Montgomery County 5th District officers with a wooden American Flag that he had made in recognition of National First Responders Day. The flag will be displayed in the 5th District Station."</p>

      <p>On Friday the police department posted what it said was a note from Elrich saying otherwise.</p>
      <p>"Acting Police Chief Marcus Jones and I understand the concerns of the community," the county executive said in the note.</p>
      <p>He concluded by saying, “Under my administration, we are committed to improving police relations with the community and will immediately address any action that stands against our mission."</p>
