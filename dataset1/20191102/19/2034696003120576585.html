      <p>On Thursday (October 31), the band announced a comeback show at Los Angeles’ Shrine Expo Hall taking place on December 20. Tickets went on sale yesterday (November 1) and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/fans-react-chemical-romance-reunion-show-sells-minutes-2563843">sold out in minutes.</a></p>
      <p>Early this morning (November 2), the band took to Instagram to thank fans for the incredible reception they’ve received since announcing their return, adding that they didn’t expect it.</p>
      <p>“It is truly unbelievable to us the happiness we have experienced over the past two days,” the post began. “From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for the warm welcome back. We truly did not expect this. See you soon. Xoxo, MCR.”</p>
