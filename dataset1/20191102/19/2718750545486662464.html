      <h1>Are These Two <i>British Bake Off</i> Sweeties Dating?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T19:55:11+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 19:55</time> by <a rel="author">Bridget Read</a></address>
      <p>If you need one pure thing to cling to today, let it be that two sweet season-six <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/the-great-british-baking-show/"><i>Great British Bake Off</i></a> (or <i>Great British Baking Show </i>here in the U.S.) contestants might be dating. Yes, Michael Chakraverty and Henry Bird, who both competed this year on the world’s most palliative reality show, are possibly now a couple. The rumors come from social media, naturally, after the bakers’ co-star, Alice Fevronia, a geography teacher with very nice hair, posted a photo on her stories of the two of them looking cozy with the caption “BAE-ke Off.”</p>

      <p>Okay, but what about this cutie post from Michael on Twitter congratulating Henry’s run on the show with Salt-N-Pepa lyrics? Getting stronger … </p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/mschakraverty/status/1184201405504151557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>When Michael left, Henry called him “one of the finest of men,” which seems like a pretty British way to possibly say, “We’re dating.” (Or they’re not.) </p>

      </figure>
      <p>But what about <i>this</i> post that Henry made with screenshots of the two of them hugging on the show? Under which the subtitles read “THEY GROAN”?</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/henryfabird/status/1183842617274109953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Or this one from Fevronia on Instagram way back in September, which says, “But how many couples can you see” under a photo of Henry kissing Michael on the cheek? </p>

      <p>The bakers in question have yet to confirm or deny rumors. Yet, anyway. </p>
