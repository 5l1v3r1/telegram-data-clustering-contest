      <h1>Hezbollah TV channel says Twitter accounts suspended</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T19:59:46+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 19:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.afp.com/" target="_blank">AFP Relax News</a></address>
      <p>The television station of Lebanon's powerful Shiite movement Hezbollah protested Saturday that most of its Twitter accounts had been suspended.</p>
      <p>Al-Manar accused the US-based social media platform of giving in to "political pressures".</p>
      <p>"Account suspended," one such Arabic-language account, @almanarnews, read late Saturday.</p>
      <p>"There is no place on Twitter for illegal terrorist organisations and violent extremist groups," a Twitter spokesperson told AFP.</p>
      <p>The accounts in English, French and Spanish were also not available, but the Twitter handles of specific television shows seemed to be functioning.</p>
      <p>Iran-backed Hezbollah is designated a "terrorist" group by the United States and several of its officials are under US sanctions, but it is also a key political player in Lebanon.</p>
      <p>The group held three ministerial posts and a majority with its Christian allies before Lebanon's cabinet fell this week after 13 days of mass anti-graft protests.</p>
      <p>Hezbollah is the only group not to have disarmed after Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war, and it fought Israeli troops who occupied southern Lebanon until 2000.</p>
      <p>It has also been a key ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the neighbouring country's eight-year conflict.</p>
