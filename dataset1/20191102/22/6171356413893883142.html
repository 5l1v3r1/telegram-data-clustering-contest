      <h1>Samsung's next Android flip phone will support 5G, could have a foldable screen</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T22:00:37+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>Clamshell phones are still very much alive in Asia, as evidenced by last year's <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/11/10/samsungs-2700-w2019-flip-phone-debuts-snapdragon-845-dual-cameras-dual-displays/#ap-lightbox">$2,700 Samsung W2019 flip phone</a> (pictured above). Samsung is preparing to announce its next flip phone, and not only will it support 5G, but it might have a foldable screen.</p>
      <p>China Telecom posted the below image to its Weibo account, revealing that the Samsung W20 will arrive sometime in November. The phone will also support 5G.</p>

      <p>It's not clear if the W20 is another clamshell device with a keypad on the bottom half, or if the W20 has a foldable screen like <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/01/motorola-foldable-razr-leaks/">Motorola's upcoming Razr phone</a>. SamsungMobile is reporting that the device is just another regular clamshell, but there were rumors of a Razr-style phone <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/06/25/samsungs-next-foldable-phone-could-be-a-lot-like-motorolas-unreleased-razr/">earlier this year</a>, and Samsung released concept videos of a super-tall folding device <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/29/samsung-galaxy-fold-2-tease/">just a few days ago</a>.</p>

      <p>No matter what the form factor will be, the phone will <i>definitely</i> be expensive, and probably won't see an official release outside of Asia.</p>
