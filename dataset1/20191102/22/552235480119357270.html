      <h1>Neil McCann backed for Hearts job as Rangers star Glen Kamara reveals his debt of gratitude</h1>
      <h2>The former Jambos icon is one of a number of names linked as Craig Levein’s Tynecastle successor.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T22:29:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Waddell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>Rangers midfielder Glen Kamara believes <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-mccann">Neil McCann</a> would be a perfect fit for the vacant Hearts hotseat.</p>
      <p>The former Jambos icon is one of a number of names linked as Craig Levein’s Tynecastle successor.</p>
      <p>And Kamara - who’ll be hoping to add to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> gloom at Hampden with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> - insists his former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dundee-fc">Dundee</a> gaffer is more than capable of bossing the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> strugglers.</p>
      <p>He said: “Neil is a great manager and he helped me a lot, he kick-started my career and I still speak to him.</p>

      <p>“I actually gave him one of my Finland international strips just as a thank you, I felt I owed him for everything he did for me.</p>
      <p>“It would be good to see him back in the game.”</p>
      <p>McCann spent 18 months in the Dens Park hotseat but lost his job in October 2018 with his side bottom of the Premiership after seven defeats in eight games.</p>
      <p>The ex-Jambos hero, who spent two seasons on Gorgie between 1996 and 1998, has been working as a pundit this season.</p>
