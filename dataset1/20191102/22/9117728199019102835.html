        <b>After leading the midfield in qualifying once again, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> driver <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/carlos-sainz">Carlos Sainz Jr.</a> was eager to point out the progress his team has made compared to last season, with the Spaniard almost equalling last season's pole-setting time.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sainz's 1:32.8 is almost two and a half seconds quicker than Fernando Alonso's time for McLaren in 2018, underlining just how far the Woking-based team have come compared to last campaign, when they finished the year in sixth place.</p>
      <p>Now, the side sit in fourth place and comfortably so, with Sainz leading the charge as he's wrapped up in a battle for sixth place in the championship with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon">Alexander Albon</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/pierre-gasly">Pierre Gasly</a>.</p>
