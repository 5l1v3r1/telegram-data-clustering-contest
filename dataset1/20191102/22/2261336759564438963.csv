It took Nate Diaz three years to make his UFC comeback, but the Stockton native couldn’t have planned it any better. Outclassing Anthony Pettis in the co-main event of UFC 241 in August, Diaz always had Masvidal in mind for his next fight as he called out the fellow UFC veteran in his post-fight interview. After that it was on the UFC to put the fight together, and not only did they do that, they also made a brand new title, the ‘BMF’ title, just for this fight.
