      <p>It took 86 years for Washington D.C. to celebrate its first World Series title, so Saturday’s championship parade was as lit as one might imagine.</p>
      <p>Fans came from all over the DMV area and beyond to attend the parade, watching their favorite players and coaches dance, drink and celebrate winning it all.</p>
