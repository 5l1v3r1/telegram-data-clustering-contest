      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/the-game">The Game</a> has released new song ‘Stainless’, which hears him reflect on his relationship with Death Row Records co-founder <a href="http://nme.com/artists/suge-knight">Suge Knight</a> – listen to it below.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The new track is set to feature on the ‘Hate It or Love It’ rapper’s upcoming ninth studio album, ‘Born 2 Rap’, which is schedule to be released on November 29.</p>
      <p>With <a href="http://nme.com/artists/anderson-paak">Anderson .Paak</a> on the hook, ‘Stainless’ hears The Game share his perspective on several West Coast figures, including Suge Knight.</p>
      <p>“<i>I went from wanting to be Suge to hating Suge to fucking with him/ 28 years a long ass time, it’s fucking with him</i>,” he raps, referencing <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/suge-knight-sentenced-28-years-prison-2386831">Knight’s recent prison sentence.</a> “<i>Talked to him on the phone the other day/ About how he could’ve signed me before Dre… If that nigga Bron Bron rap it would sound like this/ Somewhere between Cube and ‘Kiss, I can’t miss.</i>“</p>
      <p>Elsewhere on the record, The Game namechecks 2Pac, pays homage to one of the tracks on his diamond-selling double album <i>All Eyez on Me</i>, and sends a rest in peace shout out to late Outlawz members Fatal and Kadafi.</p>
      <p>“Picture me rolling like ‘Pac, nigga/ But I’m not Pac, nigga/ I be in that Beamer with it cocked, nigga,” he spits. “Baby Lane killed ‘Pac/ Niggas killed Baby Lane/ Bountry was busting back, Heron died in his chain/ A fatal car crash killed Fatal Hussein/ R.I.P. Kadafi, driving down memory lane.”</p>

      <p>The Game is not the only one who seems to have made peace with Knight, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/snoop-dogg-pays-tribute-controversial-death-row-boss-suge-knight-new-song-2536515">Snoop Dogg recently paid tribute to his one-time enemy on ‘Let Bygones Be Bygones’, taken from his new album ‘I Wanna Thank Me’.</a></p>
      <p>Reminiscing on the 1990s, the nostalgic track sees Snoop pay tribute to the former Death Row Records’ CEO’s leadership skills, as he casts Knight in a surprisingly sympathetic light.</p>
      <p>At one point, Snoop raps: “<i>Studio every night to the early morn’/ Bloods and Crips all moving on one accord/ Cuz did that/ took Death Row to the top, my boys did that!</i>“</p>
      <p>In August, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-game-channels-mad-max-in-video-for-fiery-new-single-west-side-2535002">The Game released a video for his track ‘West Side’</a>. Aside from the obvious nod to <i>Mad Max</i>, the video also shares similarities with 2Pac and <a href="http://nme.com/artists/dr-dre">Dr. Dre</a>‘s ‘California Love’ music video, which itself drew inspiration from the Mel Gibson-led 1979 movie.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/anderson-paak-reflects-on-being-homeless-music-was-my-fighting-chance-2558892">Anderson .Paak has opened up on being homeless in the past as he prepares to play a series of benefit concerts in the US.</a></p>
      <p>The Californian artist will perform at <i>iHeart Radio</i>‘s Modelo Fighting Chance Concert Series this month, with shows scheduled to take place in San Francisco, Atlanta, and New York City.</p>
