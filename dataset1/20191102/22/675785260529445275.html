      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The Dutchman played alongside Lampard at Chelsea - and is not surprised to see him thriving in the dugout</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T22:30:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Mullock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/simon-mullock/</a></address>
      <p>Former Chelsea midfielder Bolo Zenden knew Frank ­Lampard was destined to become a top ­manager from the moment he played alongside him.</p>
      <p>Zenden, the Dutchman who has been both a team-mate and a coach of the former England international, recognised Lampard as a natural leader of men when he arrived at Stamford Bridge in 2001.</p>
      <p>The ex-Holland star was so ­impressed by Lampard’s ability to read the game that he nicknamed him ‘The General’.</p>
      <p>But what impressed Zenden the most was how <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> ’s most fearsome competitor never lost his human touch.</p>
      <p>Zenden said: “Frank is such a warm person. He always has time for the people around him.</p>
      <p>“As a player, when you saw him getting stuck in it was hard to ­imagine that off the pitch he was always a kind and wonderful person.</p>

      <p>“By the end of his career, his ­trophy room was well filled. Three league titles, four FA Cups, the Champions League and the Europa League.</p>
      <p>“Frank was always crazy about winning – both individually and as part of the team.</p>
      <p>“He used to be really sick after a defeat. When things went wrong for his team Frank changed into a ­different person. He was not afraid to stick the boot in.</p>
      <p>“But as soon as the match was ­finished he was enough of a ­gentleman to shake hands.</p>
      <p>“Frank is someone who can always put things in perspective and knows what matters most in life.</p>
      <p>“Football is important to him, but he knows when to put the ­emphasis on other things. That is a very ­important ­quality for a ­manager.”</p>

      <p>Both Zenden and Lampard ­arrived in the same ­summer. The Dutchman’s stay at the club lasted just two seasons – while ­Lampard became Chelsea’s record goalscorer over the next 13 years.</p>
      <p>Zenden added: “Frank came from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> and I had been at ­ <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> , but as new boys and young players we both had to fight for a place in the team.</p>
      <p>“Chelsea ­already had a lot of big names – Emmanuel Petit, Marcel Desailly and Gianfranco Zola.</p>
      <p>“But one thing I soon noticed was that Frank could read the game ­better than anyone. On the pitch I called him ‘The General’ because he was a real strategist.</p>
      <p>“Frank is also a born leader. You could see that in the way he grew into the player who controlled Chelsea’s ­midfield. He directed the play, like the conductor of an orchestra, but he also had an unbelievable hunger for goals and trophies.</p>
      <p>“His development as a player was like a snowball rolling down a hill – getting bigger and bigger – and I can see that happening as a manager.”</p>
      <p>Lampard has overcome a tough start to his Chelsea reign to guide the Blues into the top four of the ­Premier League.</p>
      <p>And Zenden, who became Rafa Benitez’s assistant at Stamford Bridge when the Spaniard won the Europa League in 2013, got a ­close-up look at Chelsea’s ­youngsters when they beat Ajax 1-0 in ­Amsterdam in the Champions League earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Lampard has put his faith in a group of young English players from Chelsea’s youth academy after being forced to work under a transfer ban that will be lifted next summer.</p>
      <p>Zenden said: “Tammy ­Abraham, Mason Mount, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Fikayo Tomori would not have been given a chance under different circumstances. But they are doing much better than people expected.</p>
      <p>“That is down to the quality of each of those players – but it is also a big credit to Frank for the way he is working with them.”</p>
