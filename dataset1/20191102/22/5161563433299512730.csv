Pamela Anderson draws criticism for Halloween tweet
02 Nov 2019, 22:51 by Ian Holliday, CTV Vancouver Island
VANCOUVER - Notable B.C. resident Pamela Anderson is drawing heavy criticism online after posting photos of herself posing in a feathered headdress.
Anderson tweeted the photos Thursday afternoon with the caption ""Happy Halloween."" Since then, more than 500 tweets have been sent in response, many of them criticizing her for appropriating Indigenous culture.
""This is really disappointing and racist Pam, I thought you were better than this,"" wrote one user, who went on to describe warbonnets as sacred and earned.
""Culture isn't a costume, it's not disposable, it's not an aesthetic,"" the user wrote.



As of Saturday afternoon, the tweet was still posted on Anderson's account, and no follow up posts from the account had addressed the controversy.
