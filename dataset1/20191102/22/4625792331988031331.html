      <h1>Axelrod says Buttigieg’s 2020 prediction is ‘campaign strategist’s nightmare’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T22:56:42+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 22:56</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Brown</a></address>
      <p>David Axelrod warned that Pete Buttigieg's public opining about the 2020 Democratic primary is "unhelpful" to the South Bend, Indiana, mayor and a "campaign strategist's nightmare."</p>
      <p>"The campaign strategist’s nightmare: When the candidate goes all pundit in an interview. Unhelpful," tweeted the chief strategist for President Barack Obama's campaigns on Saturday. Linking to a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/pete-buttigieg-election-two-way-race-elizabeth-warren-1469315"><i>Newsweek</i></a> article, Axelrod added the mayor's punditry was "Honest but unnecessary. All part of learning the rules of a game in which candor can sound like hubris."</p>

      <p>The 37-year-old Buttigieg recently told John Heilemann of Showtime's <i>The Circus</i> that he foresees the 2020 Democratic primary shaping up to be "a two-way" between himself and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. "It's early to say," he said. "I'm not saying that it <i>is</i> a two-way. ... A world where we're getting somewhere is that world where it's coming down to the two of us."</p>

      <p>Buttigieg also dismissed the front-runner status of former Vice President Joe Biden, saying, "Either he is the unstoppable front-runner — and we can all go home — or he is not. Anybody who's in this race is pure on the assumption that he's not."</p>

      <p>Buttigieg has remained resilient in the polls as others once deemed to be top-tier candidates have fallen away, such as California Sen. Kamala Harris, who is already <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/kamala-harris-lays-off-entire-new-hampshire-field-team-amid-dozens-of-staff-cuts">hemorrhaging staff</a>. Buttigieg <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/biden-comes-in-fourth-place-in-iowa-poll-as-buttigieg-rises">seized second place</a> in the latest RealClearPolitics poll of Iowa voters, coming in at 17% behind Warren's 22.3%.</p>
      <p>Democratic strategists are already floating the possibility that Buttigieg could end up being the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/02/in-iowa-biden-confronts-a-growing-threat-pete-buttigieg-064382">Democratic nominee</a>, with former Clinton staffer Michael Gordon recently <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/real-moral-authority-democratic-strategist-predicts-buttigieg-could-end-up-going-toe-to-toe-with-trump">telling</a> <i>Newsweek</i>, "You could picture him more going toe-to-toe with Trump. He has a real moral authority in the way he talks, so he's someone ... who could surprise in, like, Iowa."</p>
