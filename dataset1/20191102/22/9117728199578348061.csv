Drivers couldn't improve enough on the 2nd lap of Q3 as the conditions didn't improve. Bottas managed to do the all-important qualifying lap in the first round and Bottas pointed this out in his interview on-track. 
""It was a nice lap in the beginning of Q3, you rarely get those. Yesterday was a bit tricky. I knew how to put it together and it was a nice feeling to actually do it in Q3,"" Bottas said. 
Bottas' teammate, Lewis Hamilton didn't manage to get that first lap in and as a result will start from 5th.
