      <h1>Cardiff's refusal to pay Emiliano Sala transfer fee having knock-on effect on tragic striker's boyhood club</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: San Martin - a fifth-tier club in Argentina - were going to use the money for repairs to their stadium</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T22:30:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Mullock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/simon-mullock/</a></address>
      <p>Cardiff City's refusal to pay the disputed £14.7million fee for Emiliano Sala is causing problems for the tragic striker’s boyhood club.</p>
      <p>San Martin, a fifth- division team based in Sala’s home town of Progreso, were set to bank more than £110,000 from the deal <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Cardiff</a> struck with Nantes for the player in January.</p>
      <p>Sala was killed when the light aircraft taking him to South Wales to join up with his new club crashed in the English Channel.</p>
      <p>Cardiff insist that the transfer had not been completed.</p>
      <p>And when FIFA ruled last month that the Bluebirds must make a £5.3million downpayment and then pay the fee in full over the next two years, the Championship club launched an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>

      <p>That has meant San Martin have also been left in limbo – after earmarking the windfall to make repairs on the stadium that was renamed in Sala’s honour on Thursday to mark what would have been his 29th birthday.</p>
      <p>Club president Daniel Ribero insists Cardiff promised financial help when chief executive Ken Choo and manager Neil Warnock attended Sala’s funeral in Progreso in February.</p>
      <p>Ribero said: “We have not received the money that is owed to us for training rights.</p>
      <p>“That is because Cardiff are appealing the decision of FIFA and we are still waiting for a resolution.</p>
      <p>“But it is still disappointing that we have had no more contact with the Cardiff leadership.</p>
      <p>“When they were at Emiliano’s funeral they said they were interested in giving our club a helping hand. But they never got in touch with us again.”</p>
      <p>Sala joined San Martin at the age of five and spent a decade with the club before moving to Europe.</p>
