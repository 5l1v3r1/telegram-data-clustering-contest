      <h1>Man Utd ready to hijack Liverpool's move for Timo Werner in January transfer window</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The Red Devils want to beat their fiercest rivals to the to the RB Leipzig striker</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T22:30:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Mullock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/simon-mullock/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United are ready to hijack Liverpool’s bid to bring German striker Timo Werner to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>United, who drew a blank in defeat at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> , are ready to make a move for 23-year-old RB Leipzig hit-man in the January transfer window in an effort to beat their Anfield rivals to one of Europe’s most highly-rated finishers.</p>
      <p>Werner signed a new four-year contract with Leipzig in the summer when his dream move to Bayern Munich failed to materialise.</p>
      <p>But the agreement included a buy-out clause of just £27million.</p>
      <p>And after failing to replace Romelu Lukaku after allowing Belgian – who had topped the Old Trafford goal charts in each of the previous two seasons to move to Inter Milan – Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has a weakness in his squad that needs addressing.</p>

      <p>United believe the promise of regular starts under Solskjaer will enable them to beat Jurgen Klopp to his countryman.</p>
      <p>Werner fits the profile United now use to identify targets in terms of age and ability to develop into a world-class talent.</p>
      <p>And he also offers genuine value for money in an increasingly competitive market.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> already have Mo Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firminho as their front three and would ideally like to sign the player next year.</p>
      <p>Werner, who moved to east Germany from his hometown club in 2016, has won 28 caps for his country.</p>
      <p>United have sent scouts to watch him in every game he has played this season for Leipzig.</p>
      <p>Werner has netted 11 goals in 16 appearances for club and country after scoring 21 times last season.</p>
