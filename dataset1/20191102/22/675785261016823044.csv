An Instagram model has claimed she has earned £60,000 in just eight months by flogging revealing lingerie snaps online.
Chloe Horton, 19, from Clydebank, Scotland, said she pockets £20 every time somebody subscribes to her OnlyFans page and takes home a  £7,500 'wage' every month.
Not content with her bumper earnings, the busty brunette has 'upgraded' to rival site Admire Me VIP, which she thinks will allow her to earn up to £15,000-a-month
Chloe tweeted: ""Mental to think I've made 60 grand from only fans since February.""
Chloe insists she has never posted full nude pictures on her page which has been branded a porn site for wannabe glamour models.

OnlyFans subscribers pay cash to view lingerie-clad women on camera.
Users are able to splash out more to see saucier naked snaps.
There is also an option to pay £35 to view images deemed too explicit for other social media outlets.

Chloe made the claim about her income on Twitter

She added: ""Now time to say bye bye to it and get on the Admire Me VIP and make double.
""And that's just from underwear pics.""
Chloe was once body-shamed online after sharing bikini snaps, the Sun Online reported.
Vile messages branded her “fat”, “a big lassie” and “a wrestler”.
Admire Me VIP states ""VIPs can upload exclusive content for their admirers"".
