      <p>GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — Family and friends will gather to remember former U.S. Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina, who died of a rare virus at the age of 66.</p>
      <p>The service for Hagan will be held at 2 p.m. Sunday at First Presbyterian Church in Greensboro, where she lived for decades. A Hagan family spokeswoman has said the church service will be open to the public and followed by a visitation with the family.</p>
      <p>About three years ago, Hagan contracted a rare virus spread from ticks to humans, leading to brain inflammation that made it difficult for her to speak and walk. She died Monday.</p>
      <p>The Democrat was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2008, after a 10-year state legislative career. Hagan served one term before losing to Republican Thom Tillis in 2014.</p>
