Matthijs de Ligt was the match-winner as Juventus beat Torino 1-0 in the Turin derby on Saturday to stay at the top of Serie A.
The Dutch defender took on Cristiano Ronaldo's role, scoring in the 70th minute to earn Sarri's side a hard-fought three points against their neighbours.
De Ligt's goal took Juve back to the top of the table ahead of Inter, who had beaten Bologna in dramatic circumstances earlier in the day.
Soriano had given Bologna a second-half lead but Romelu Lukaku drew Antonio Conte's side level and the Belgian striker then converted a penalty in stoppage time to seal the win.
Earlier, Roma had beaten Napoli 2-1 to move third in the table in Italy's top flight.
