Rangers midfielder Glen Kamara believes Neil McCann would be a perfect fit for the vacant Hearts hotseat.
The former Jambos icon is one of a number of names linked as Craig Levein’s Tynecastle successor.
And Kamara - who’ll be hoping to add to the Hearts gloom at Hampden with Rangers - insists his former Dundee gaffer is more than capable of bossing the Premiership strugglers.
He said: “Neil is a great manager and he helped me a lot, he kick-started my career and I still speak to him.

“I actually gave him one of my Finland international strips just as a thank you, I felt I owed him for everything he did for me.
“It would be good to see him back in the game.”
McCann spent 18 months in the Dens Park hotseat but lost his job in October 2018 with his side bottom of the Premiership after seven defeats in eight games.
The ex-Jambos hero, who spent two seasons on Gorgie between 1996 and 1998, has been working as a pundit this season.
