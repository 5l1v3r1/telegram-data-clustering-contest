      <h2>Newcomers have to meet two conditions to qualify for a free house in Cammarata, Sicily, where there are more than 100 houses sit abandoned and crumbling</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T22:04:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 22:04</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>An Italian town is giving <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/housing">houses</a> away for free because it is so desperate to attract new residents - but there's a catch, obviously.</p>
      <p>The mountainside community of Cammarata boasts sweeping views of Mount Etna and gorgeous sunsets on the Mediterranean island of Sicily and is rich in history.</p>
      <p>But with its population is dwindling and many buildings sitting empty, Mayor Vincenzo Giambrone has launched an ambitious scheme to save his home town and its historic centre.</p>
      <p>He is convincing owners of abandoned family homes to hand over the keys to the crumbling buildings to new residents who are willing to fix them up and put down roots.</p>
      <p>Couples who have a baby after moving in will be given a cash bonus.</p>

      <p>Buyers must submit a refurbishment proposal, pay a 5,000 euro (£4,300) deposit and agree to renovate the property within three years.</p>
      <p>The deposit will be returned once the renovations are complete and the building is turned into a family home or a business such as a B&amp;B, shop or restaurant.</p>

      <p>Couples who move in and later have a baby will be given a 1,000 euro (£865) bonus.</p>
      <p>Mr Giambrone told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/italy-cammarata-free-houses/index.html">CNN Travel</a> that he is determined to make the town, which sits at an elevation of about 3,200ft, a vibrant place to live again.</p>
      <p>He said: "I can't stand to see this gorgeous, old historical centre empty and turn into a ruin.</p>
      <p>"It hurts me."</p>

      <p>Mr Giambrone said some of the neglected buildings are at risk of collapsing.</p>
      <p>There are more than 100 abandoned houses in the town.</p>
      <p>About a dozen empty stone buildings are currently available and ready for new residents.</p>
      <p>UK-based businessman Jose Augusto Manetta Ramos was tempted by the prospect of living in a sleepy village with a warm climate.</p>
      <p>Calling it a "perfect retreat", the Brazilian-Italian sales executive said: "Cammarata is stunning, the green landscape, the sea and mountains are both nearby just like the Valley of the Temples (archaeological site) and other great spots."</p>
      <p>Sicily, the largest island in the Mediterranean, boasts hot and dry summers and mild and wet winters with snow over higher ground.</p>
      <p>A number of Italian towns have put homes up for sale for just one euro - with conditions - in a bid to revitalise themselves.</p>
      <p>The hilltop town of Sambuca, Sicily, did so after undergoing depopulation as residents move to bigger cities with more conveniences.</p>
      <p>New owners must agree to refurbish their property within three years and pay a 5,000 euro deposit.</p>
      <p>Zungoli, in the Campania region of southern Italy, and Mussomeli, also on the island of Sicily, have offered similar schemes to lure new blood.</p>
      <p>In Britain, an abandoned 12th Century pub <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/abandoned-pub-goes-sale-jaw-20798197">has gone on the market for just £1.</a></p>
      <p>The Mill Beach Pub in Heybridge, Essex, closed in November last year and is in need of a complete overhaul.</p>
