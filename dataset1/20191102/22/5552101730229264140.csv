【暗巷內，還有幸福嗎 E04】離婚失親無一技之長 那些流浪街頭的女人
02 Nov 2019, 22:01 by 陳玉梅, 林俊耀
在街頭，我一直比較少機會碰到女性街友。有次在公園掃地的阿華告訴我，公園內涼亭最近來了一個女街友，街友因為怕被趕，經常睡一晚，隔天一大早東西收一收就離開了，於是有一天，我很早就去公園，想看看能否跟她聊一聊。
清晨五點多，公園非常舒服，隨著車聲越來越吵，大家要上班上學，遊民已經一一離開公園涼亭，只剩下阿華說的那個女街友。女街友留著短髮，看起來四十歲上下，從她有點髒汙黝黑的臉，依稀可以看到她清秀的樣子，阿華說她看到這個女街友已經有四、五年了，估計她應該流浪至少四、五年了。
我問她流浪幾年了？她抬起頭，眼神有點迷茫的說她不知道。她也不知道自己幾歲。原來，當一個人失去社會關係，沒有人跟你說話，最後就是不知道今夕是何夕。當時她的精神狀況已經很不好了，已經無法跟我交談了，我猜測她有精神疾病，因為跟家人的衝突摩擦，逐漸就跟家人失去聯繫了。
當年那個眼神迷茫的女街友，一直讓我惦記著，我覺得有機會一定要訪問到女街友。訪問女街友很困難，因為她們充滿戒心，她們在街頭生活更困難，很容易被欺負，處境比男性更惡劣危險。我甚至聽過輔導街友的志工提起，曾有女街友被性侵懷孕的事，但是我一直無法證實。
女性街友在街頭 她們的生存守則
這些年，或許是因為離婚跟家庭結構的瓦解越來越嚴重，女街友越來越多。2010年，當代漂泊成立，這是一個幫助街友的民間組織，我認識了裡面的社工郭盈靖。盈靖在當時康定街的跳蚤市場認識了已經流浪十年的一個阿姨，她因為先生會打她，很年輕就離家到臺北，小孩就留給先生撫養。阿姨剛開始做生意，年紀大了生意不好，就去批些貨到跳蚤市場賣或去撿回收。那時康定街的住戶晚上會把家裡東西清出來，盈靖曾有好幾個晚上幫她整理能賣的包包、鞋子跟衣服。
雖然阿姨是可以租2、3千塊的房子，但是她最後還是沒有租，因為這樣的房子通常都在暗巷，環境惡劣，門鎖又不安全，阿姨擔心自己工作完都很晚才回家，如果有人尾隨在她身後，對她做什麼可能也沒有人可以幫他，不如住在外面，遇上壞人還可以大叫。她到處睡，睡騎樓被趕，就睡公園，每天就帶著自己的家當移來移去。在街頭，她常睡到半夜被捏鼻子或被人丟石頭攻擊。她非常想家想念孩子，好希望再見孩子一面，但是她先生不准。因為長年睡外面，都睡不好，加上工作勞累，阿姨身體很差，57歲就走了。
2011年，市政府辦花博，看龍山寺附近睡了很多街友，但是觀光客又多，市政府想整頓市容，每到晚上，就開始噴水驅趕遊民。那年冬天特別冷，很多遊民被噴到重感冒，沒辦法好好睡上一覺，苦不堪言。一般人平常一天沒睡好，就非常痛苦，更何況街友日日躺在街頭，街頭狀況這麼多，可能被趕，還有蚊蟲這麼多，又睡不暖，現在政府又找人噴水驅趕，那年年尾，這件事情鬧得很大，我在那時認識了阿春。
阿春那時就睡在龍山寺那附近，寒冬裡，阿春鋪個紙板，蓋個睡袋，可是睡袋裡冷冰冰，好不容易睡暖了，警察就把他挖起來，清潔人員就開始噴水洗地板。那時有市議員在議會大罵萬華街友影響市容，要求市府對他們持續噴水。每晚被水噴到無法睡覺的阿春因此罹患了重感冒，非常痛苦，他說，這政府簡直是把他們當垃圾，想把他們清掉。她鼓起很大的勇氣站出來，跟當代漂泊一起開了記者會抗議。
女街友通常是離婚，或是未婚的貧窮女性，因為失去家人的聯繫，再無一技之長。阿春就是這樣，她是雲林人，家裡非常貧窮，兄弟姐妹也多，她小學沒畢業就出來幫人打掃，後來在電子廠上班，做沒幾年電子廠就說要去大陸，她被裁員，從此阿春就很難找工作。後來她父母過世了，她回老家，被嫂嫂趕出來，其他兄妹各有家庭，阿春也不好意思麻煩他們，開始流浪到北部。阿春想透過婚姻找到依靠也很難，她說，頭路不穩定，日子艱苦，我不敢嫁；也嘸人敢娶我。這些女遊民就像日本社會所說的最貧困女子，因為各種無緣——家庭關係無緣、人際關係的無緣以及制度的無緣，與障礙——罹患精神疾病（精神障礙）、由於家境不佳失去受教育機會，難有穩定工作（發展障礙），從小便注定日後貧困的命運。
每到入冬 狀況更是雪上加霜
最近，我問社工盈靖，台北車站這幾年對待遊民的態度有什麼改變？遊民的生活處境可有改善？盈靖說，經過當代漂泊持續跟台北市政府以及北車管理處溝通，北車管理處製作了大型置物袋，現在遊民只要把家當都放在置物袋裡，北車管理處就不會清理掉。一班民眾似乎也越來越感受到，這是個高風險的社會，也不認為自己工作是那麼穩定，也隨時可能失業，因而越來越理解接納街友。
現在每到冬天，有人會想到在台北車站這些街友可能睡不暖，就訂些床墊跟睡袋，送去給街友。還有慈善團體跟公司送便當到北車給街友吃。整個社會氛圍對街友越來越友善。北車那邊的街友的物資相對是充裕的。就這點看來，台灣社會還是有進步。這是當記者的好處，會看到長時間社會的變化，以及在這個社會變化裡，人的變化。
2011年，阿春跟我哭哭啼啼講到，警察怎麼趕她，她因為睡不飽，身體因而吃不消。後來她認識了一個男性朋友，兩人舉牌存了一點錢就一起去租房子，當然房子環境不好，還會漏水，但是至少可以好好睡個覺。只是去年她又回到台北車站，可能跟男性朋友分手了。
女性街友在街頭通常會找個男性朋友保護他們，像現在北車一些年輕的女性街友，她們因為父母離婚，跟著父親或母親，可能因為父母管教嚴格，或父親再娶，無法跟後來的繼母以及兄弟姊妹相處，就來到北車，通常她們也是會找個男人陪伴，甚至一起去租房子，一起分擔經濟，可是當關係斷了，又得再回街頭生活。
把街頭當家 即使她們有個「家」
盈靖提到他在北車認識了兩個很不一樣的「女性街友」，其中一個當阿嬤了，是個鑽地工，當時機場捷運正在蓋，她就在機場捷運Ａ1那裡工作。她老家在中部，透天厝還是她跟先生一起蓋的，他們有五個孩子，倆人談好分工，先生在老家種田，她就出來工作。因為種田收入不穩定，總是要到收成才知道今年有多少收入，農村又沒有什麼工作，她就出來繼續做鑽地工的工作，哪裡有工地，她就去哪裡做工。她也去過六輕，但是她說，六輕空汙實在太嚴重了，所以她離開那裡，北上到機場捷運工地做。晚上，她就回中和娘家住，但是通車實在太遠了。
每次下班後，她就到台北車站坐坐，吃點東西。有天她突然發現，怎麼越到晚上，台北車站人越多，然後入夜，很多人睡在台北車站，她觀察好長一陣子，開始跟人聊，逐漸了解為什麼他們要睡在這裡，各有各的心酸。她覺得，這裡很安全，自己睡這裡好像也不錯，於是每天下班在工地梳洗後，她也開始睡在台北車站。每天她在工地領的工資就存起來，一個月存好幾萬塊，兩三年後，她跟盈靖說，她存夠錢要回家了，她一個孩子要生小孩了，她要回家幫他帶小孩。
另外一個女街友是一個中年阿姨，她因為推個行李箱，沒有用置物袋裝起來，盈靖提醒她，會被北車清掉。沒想到阿姨跟盈靖說，沒有關係，因為她白天會回家，晚上才會來。阿姨才說，她離婚了，小孩跟著先生，早年她靠著車縫，賺了一些錢，在台北買了間小套房，可是每天一個人待在那間小套房，她寂寞的快發瘋了。有一天，她來到北車，發現人來人往，很熱鬧，也開始跟這些遊民交談，她也覺得睡在這裡不錯，還有人發便當。她說，自從來台北車站睡覺以後，她的身體變好了，憂鬱症也沒了。
台北車站看起來是個交通的轉運站，可是又非常有包容性的涵容各式各樣的人。人生艱難，當社會越來越理解弱勢族群，願意善待他們，似乎就可能讓這些人的處境不再那麼悲慘了。

[In the dark alley, is there happiness? E04] There is no skill in divorce, and those who are stray on the streets.
02 Nov 2019, 22:01 by Chen Yumei, Lin Junyao
On the street, I have been less likely to meet female street friends. One time, Iowa, who was sweeping the floor in the park, told me that a pavilion in the park recently came to a female street friend. The street friend often slept for one night because he was afraid of being rushed. He left the next morning and collected something, so one day. I went to the park very early and wanted to see if I could talk to her.
At five o'clock in the morning, the park was very comfortable. As the car became more and more noisy, everyone had to go to work, and the tourists had left the park pavilion one by one, leaving only the female street friend that Ihua said. The female street friend has short hair and looks like she is 40 years old. From her a little dirty and dark face, she can see her delicate appearance. Iowa said that she has seen this female street friend for four or five years. It is estimated that she should be wandering for at least four or five years.
I asked her about her years of wandering? She looked up and looked a little confused that she didn't know. She doesn't know how old she is. It turns out that when a person loses his social relationship, no one talks to you. In the end, he does not know what the evening is. At that time, her mental condition was already very bad, and she could not talk to me. I guess she had mental illness, and she gradually lost contact with her family because of conflict with her family.
The female street friend who was confused at the time kept me thinking about it. I felt that I had the opportunity to visit the female street friend. It is difficult to visit female street friends because they are full of wariness. They are more difficult to live on the streets and are easily bullied. The situation is more dangerous than men. I even heard the volunteers who coached the street friends, and there were things that women street friends were sexually assaulted, but I have been unable to confirm.
Female street friends on the streets, their survival rules
These years, perhaps because of the increasingly serious disintegration of divorce and family structure, more and more female street friends. In 2010, the contemporary drift was established. This is a civil organization that helps street friends. I met Guo Yingjing, a social worker inside. Yingjing met an aunt who had been wandering for ten years at the flea market in Kangding Street. She would beat her because she was very young and left home to Taipei. The child was left to the husband. Aunt has just started to do business. When he is old and has a bad business, he will go to the flea market to sell or go to the recycling market. At that time, the residents of Kangding Street would clear out their homework at night. Yingjing had several nights to help her sort out the bags, shoes and clothes that she could sell.
Although the aunt can rent a house of 2 or 3 thousand, she still has no rent, because such a house is usually in a dark alley, the environment is bad, the door lock is not safe, and the aunt is worried that she will go home very late after work. If someone is behind her, there may be no one to help her. No one can live outside. If you meet a bad person, you can yell. She sleeps everywhere, sleeps in the building, and sleeps in the park. She moves with her own family every day. On the street, she often slept in the middle of the night and was pinched or attacked by stones. She is very homesick to miss her children, so I hope to see the children again, but her husband is not allowed. Because I slept outside for a long time, I couldn't sleep well, and when I was tired of work, my aunt was in poor health and left at the age of 57.
In 2011, the municipal government set up Huabo, and saw a lot of street friends sleeping near Longshan Temple, but there were many tourists. The city government wanted to rectify the city's appearance. Every night, it began to spray water to drive away the residents. That winter was particularly cold, and many of the tourists were sprayed with a bad cold, and there was no way to get a good night's sleep. The average person does not sleep well in a day, it is very painful, not to mention the street friends lying on the streets every day, the street conditions are so much, may be rushed, there are so many mosquitoes, and sleep is not warm, now the government is looking for someone to drive water to drive away, then At the end of the year, this thing was very troublesome. I met Achun at that time.
Ah Chun slept in the vicinity of Longshan Temple at that time. In the cold winter, Achun laid a cardboard and covered a sleeping bag, but the sleeping bag was cold and ice, and it was hard to get warm, the police dug him up, and the cleaning staff began to spray the floor. . At that time, there were city councillors in the parliament who wanted to influence the city, and asked the city to continue to spray water on them. Every night, Achun, who was sprayed with water and could not sleep, suffered from a bad cold. It was very painful. He said that the government simply used them as garbage and wanted to clear them. She took great courage to stand up and opened a press conference to protest with contemporary drift.
Female street friends are usually divorced, or unmarried poor women, because there is no skill in losing contact with family members. Achun is like this. She is a Yunlin person. She is very poor at home. She has many brothers and sisters. She did not graduate from elementary school and came out to help people clean up. Later, she went to work in the electronics factory. After a few years, the electronics factory said that she would go to the mainland. She was Layoffs, it is difficult to find a job from Achun. Later, her parents passed away. She returned to her hometown and was driven out by her sister. Other brothers and sisters had families, and Achun was embarrassed to trouble them and began to wander into the north. It is also difficult for Achun to find a dependency through marriage. She said that the road is unstable and the days are tough. I dare not marry; These female travellers are like the poorest women in Japanese society, because of the lack of family relationships, the lack of family relationships, the lack of interpersonal relationships, the lack of institutions, and the obstacles - suffering from mental illness (mental disorder), loss of family due to poor family conditions. Educational opportunities, it is difficult to have stable work (development obstacles), and the fate of poverty in the future is destined.
Every winter is getting worse.
Recently, I asked the social worker Ying Jing, what changes in the attitude of Taipei Station to the tourists in recent years? The living conditions of the nomads can be improved? Yingjing said that after the contemporary drift and continuous communication with the Taipei City Government and the North Vehicle Management Office, the North Vehicle Management Office produced a large storage bag. Now, as long as the tourists are putting their belongings in the storage bag, the North Vehicle Management Office will not clean up. . A group of people seems to be more and more aware that this is a high-risk society, and they do not think that their work is so stable, they may be unemployed at any time, and they are increasingly understanding to accept street friends.
Now every winter, some people think that these street friends may not sleep well at Taipei Station, order some mattresses and sleeping bags, and send them to street friends. There are also charities and the company to send a lunch to the North car to the street friends to eat. The whole social atmosphere is becoming more and more friendly to street friends. The supplies of street friends over the North Car are relatively abundant. From this point of view, Taiwanese society still has progress. This is the benefit of being a journalist, and will see long-term social changes and changes in people in this social change.
In 2011, Achun told me crying and crying about how the police rushed her. Because she didn't get enough sleep, her body couldn't afford it. Later, she met a male friend. They both went to rent a house with a small amount of money. Of course, the house environment is not good and there will be water leaks, but at least they can sleep well. Only last year she returned to Taipei Station and may break up with her male friend.
Female street friends usually find a male friend to protect them on the street. Like some young female street friends in the current car, they are divorced by their parents, followed by their father or mother, or because their parents are strict, or their father is jealous. When stepmothers and brothers and sisters get along, they come to CNR. Usually they will find a man to accompany them, and even go to rent a house together to share the economy. But when the relationship is broken, they have to go back to the streets.
Take the street as a home, even if they have a ""home""
Yingjing mentioned that he met two very different ""female street friends"" in CNR. One of them was an aunt, and he was a drillman. At that time, the airport MRT was covering, she worked at the airport MRT A1. . Her hometown is in the middle, she is still covered with her husband. They have five children. The two of them talk about the division of labor. When the husband farms in his hometown, she comes out to work. Because the income of farming is unstable, it is always necessary to know how much income this year has, and there is no work in the countryside. She will continue to work as a driller. Wherever there is a construction site, she will go to work. She also went to Six Light, but she said that the six light air pollution is too serious, so she left there and went north to the airport MRT site. In the evening, she went back to live with her mother, but it was too far to open.
Every time after work, she went to Taipei Station to sit and eat something. One day, she suddenly found out how the more people arrived at the Taipei station at night, and then went to the night. Many people slept at the Taipei station. She observed it for a while and started talking to people. I gradually understood why they were sleeping here. Every heart is sour. She felt that it was safe. It seemed to be good to sleep here. So after she got off work at the construction site every day, she also began to sleep at Taipei Station. Every day, the salary she received at the construction site was saved. She saved tens of thousands of dollars a month. Two or three years later, she told Yingjing that she had enough money to go home. She had a child who had a baby. She wanted to go back. The family helped him bring the child.
Another female street friend is a middle-aged aunt. Because she pushed a suitcase and did not use a storage bag, Yingjing reminded her that she would be cleared by the North. I did not expect Auntie to tell Yingjing that it doesn't matter because she will go home during the day and come at night. Auntie said that she was divorced, and the child followed her. In the early years, she leaned on the sewing machine and made some money. She bought a small suite in Taipei, but she stayed in that small suite every day. She was crazy and crazy. One day, she came to the North Car and found that people came and went, very lively, and began to talk to these people. She also felt that sleeping here was good, and there were people who made a lunch. She said that since she had been sleeping at the Taipei station, her body has become better and the depression has disappeared.
Taipei Station looks like a transit station for traffic, but it is very inclusive and tolerant of all kinds of people. Life is difficult. When the society is more and more understanding of the disadvantaged groups and willing to treat them kindly, it seems that the situation of these people is no longer so tragic.
