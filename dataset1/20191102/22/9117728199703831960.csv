Valtteri Bottas' pole position for the United States Grand Prix gives Mercedes their first P1 on a Saturday since the German Grand Prix way back in the height of the summer. 

Bottas finished just 0.012 ahead of Sebastian Vettel's P2 with a sublime lap in the first run of Q3. Team boss Wolff highlights Bottas' performance but also spares a thought for Hamilton who will start from fifth place. 



""It was so tight you could see the were a few cars between the same tenths I'm very happy - it's good to be on pole again - shame for Lewis - we need to see what we can do tomorrow on strategy,"" Wolff told Sky Sports. 

""With an aggressive strategy you can still compete for the win it wasn't his quali strategy so we will have to look into that.""
