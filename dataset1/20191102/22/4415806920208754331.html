      <p>Airbnb has vowed to ban “party houses” in the wake of a deadly shooting at a rented property in California.</p>
      <p>In a series of tweets on Saturday, Airbnb co-founder and chief executive Brian Chesky said the San Francisco-based company is stepping up efforts to “combat unauthorised parties and get rid of abusive host and guest conduct”.</p>
      <p>He said Airbnb is expanding manual screening of “high risk” reservations that are flagged by its system, and is also forming a rapid response team dedicated to house parties.</p>
      <p>The company will remove guests who fail to comply, Mr Chesky said.</p>

      <p>It comes after five people were killed in a Halloween party shooting in the San Francisco suburb of Orinda.</p>
      <p>Police said more than 100 people had gathered for the party.</p>
      <p>The home, surrounded by trees and up a steep driveway, had been rented on Airbnb by a woman who told the owner her large family needed a location with fresh air to escape wildfires near their home.</p>
      <p>A one-night rental on Halloween was suspicious enough that the owner reminded the renter that no parties were allowed.</p>
      <p>Michael Wang, who owns the four-bedroom house, said his wife contacted the renter on Thursday night after neighbours told them about the party.</p>
      <p>The renter, who has not been identified, said there were only a dozen people at the home but Mr Wang said he could see more people on video from his doorbell camera.</p>

      <p>“We called the police. They were on the way to go there to stop them, but before we got there the neighbour already sent us a message saying there was a shooting,” he told the San Francisco Chronicle in a phone interview.</p>
      <p>“When we arrived there, the police were already there.”</p>
      <p>Mr Chesky said in a tweet: “What happened on Thursday night in Orinda was horrible. I feel for the families and neighbours impacted by this tragedy. We are working to support them.”</p>
      <p>House parties have long been an issue for Airbnb.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Airbnb permanently banned a man who crammed more than 250 people into an Airbnb rental in Seven Hills, Ohio, for an unauthorised new year party while his host hid in a bedroom.</p>
      <p>In July, two people were killed during a party at an Airbnb in Pittsburgh.</p>
