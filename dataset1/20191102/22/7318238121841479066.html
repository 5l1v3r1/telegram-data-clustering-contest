      <p>A giant effigy of the departing Speaker of the House John Bercow was burned at a Guys Fawkes night in Kent.</p>
      <p>Edenbridge's Bonfire Society, which has a long history of burning effigies of celebrities and politicians, had prepared a 36ft-high replica of the Commons Speaker to burn on Saturday.</p>
      <p>But organisers had to apologise after Bercow's head blew off in strong winds and they had to make do with burning that.</p>
      <p>Guy Fawkes night is officially marked on 5 November and marks the night that Guy Fawkes, who was part of a plot to kill King James I of England, was arrested beneath the British Houses of Parliament in 1605 while guarding the explosives.</p>
      <p>Bercow stood down after a decade as speaker of the House of Commons on October 31. He was a divisive figure in parliament particularly amongst Brexiteers on the right of the Conservative Party.</p>
