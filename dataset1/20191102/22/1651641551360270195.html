      <p>Google did a small redesign of Chrome’s USer interface with Chrome 77, changing the position of tab management features that had lived within the tab context menu for years. If you’re thrown off by this, don’t be. We’ll show you how to get them back — some of them anyway.</p>
      <h3>How to bookmark all tabs</h3>
      <p>You can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + D or right click on the Chrome title bar and select ‘Bookmark all tabs’ from the new context menu.</p>
      <h3>How to re-open closed tabs</h3>
      <p>Ctrl + D or Right Click on the Chrome title bar and select re-open closed tab. You can also open the overflow button, navigate to history and hover over it to see a list of all your Chrome tabs.</p>
