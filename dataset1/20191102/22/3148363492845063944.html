      <h1>Gaffe-Prone Biden Briefly Claims He’s In Ohio During Iowa Stop</h1>
      <h2>Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) experienced another gaffe during a stop in Iowa over the weekend, briefly claiming that he was in Ohio while campaigning in the Hawkeye State.</h2>

      <p>Biden, who has remained gaffe-prone throughout his presidential bid, misspoke yet again during a campaign stop at Abby Finkenauer’s Fish Fry in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Saturday, briefly claiming that he was in Ohio before correcting himself.</p>
      <p>“How many unsafe bridges you still have here in the state of Ohio?” he said before correcting himself. “I mean Iowa. I was just in Ohio because they have more”:</p>

      <p>While it is true that Biden corrected himself, the flub draws attention to the mounting gaffes he has committed throughout his campaign.</p>
      <p>On Friday, for instance, Biden confused former Presidents Andrew Johnson and Andrew Jackson during a speech in Des Moines.</p>
      <p>“Look what happened in Charlottesville,” Biden said.</p>
      <p>“He said there were very fine people on both sides,” he continued, repeating the long-<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2019/08/07/joe-biden-relies-on-charlottesville-very-fine-people-hoax-in-anti-trump-speech/">debunked</a> lie he has heavily relied on throughout his presidential bid. “No president, no president has ever said that, including Andrew Johnson before the Civil War.”</p>
      <p>Similarly, Biden <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/08/24/video-gaffe-prone-biden-confuses-new-hampshire-with-vermont/">confused</a> which state he was in during a campaign stop in Keene, New Hampshire in August:</p>

      <p>Days prior to the New Hampshire gaffe, the former vice president confused Burlington, Vermont with Burlington, Iowa, although he corrected his mistake as he did in Iowa on Saturday.</p>
