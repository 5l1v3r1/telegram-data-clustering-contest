      <h1>Neil Lennon makes Celtic fan call as he begs supporters not to ruin reputation</h1>
      <h2>The Hoops boss insists offensive banners don't help anyone and asked fans to continue upholding their good reputation.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T22:30:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Scott McDermott, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-mcdermott/</a></address>
      <p>Neil Lennon says <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> fans’ offensive banners aren’t helping the club’s reputation in Europe.</p>
      <p>The Hoops were charged by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/uefa">UEFA</a> for the third time this season following the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> win over Lazio last month.</p>
      <p>That was for a banner unfurled by the Green Brigade which read ‘F*** off Lazio’ in Italian and another that resembled an emblem used by a left-wing terrorist organisation.</p>
      <p>Celtic were also carpeted for illicit chanting and will find out their punishment on November 21. But gaffer <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Lennon</a> is worried Celtic’s reputation on the continent will be tarnished if it continues.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the return game in Rome on Thursday, with Hoops fans urged not to wear club colours in the Italian capital, Lennon said: “In the main, we’ve got a great reputation for travelling in Europe and I want that to continue.</p>

      <p>“We want the fans to go and enjoy the experience and be careful.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there’s any animosity between the two clubs. It’s something separate from football and we want to quell that as quickly as possible before we go there.</p>
      <p>“We should be trying to make friends while we’re in Italy, rather than create animosity.</p>
      <p>“I’m not going to criticise our fans because in the main, they’re good – but the banners don’t help. I can’t speak on behalf of the people with the banners but it doesn’t do the club any good.”</p>
      <p>Italian fans have a bad reputation for racist behaviour and Lennon says he’ll go on the advice of UEFA and club officials on what to do if Celtic’s players are abused on Thursday.</p>

      <p>He said: “There are protocols in place. Whether I need to speak to the players, I’ll take a gauge off our club officials on that.</p>
      <p>“There’s a meeting on the morning of the game with the referees, fourth official and UEFA delegates so we’ll get a steer from that.</p>
      <p>“Then, if I need to speak to the players, I will.”</p>
      <p>Celtic first fell foul of UEFA in August when the club was fined £11,000 after fans set off flares and threw objects during their 4-1 win over AIK in Stockholm.</p>
      <p>When more pyrotechnics were set off before their Group E opener win over Cluj, UEFA hit the Hoops with a £10,400 fine.</p>
