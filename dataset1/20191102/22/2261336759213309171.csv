UFC 244: Jorge Masvidal vs. Nate Diaz win probabilities and possible bets
02 Nov 2019, 22:01 by Paul Gift



The win probabilities for UFC 244’s five qualifying matchups are in. Here are the estimated odds for each bout where both fighters have at least four fully-documented prior fights and aren’t heavyweights. For statistical overload on the distance, clinch, and ground alternative stats behind the inaugural BMF belt matchup, see Tuesday’s piece.

Kelvin Gastelum (57.8%) over Darren TillVicente Luque (52.6%) over Stephen ThompsonGregor Gillespie (57.9%) over Kevin LeeMakwan Amirkhani (55.4%) over Shane BurgosJulio Arce (57.7%) over Hakeem Dawodu
An official prediction can’t be made for Masvidal-Diaz since complete data for Masvidal’s most recent destruction of Ben Askren is unavailable, even though it was only five seconds. And it might’ve made a difference since - just for fun - the model would’ve edged to Diaz at 58.8% in a world where Masvidal’s last fight didn’t exist.

 This is an experiment and entertainment. Do not bet on the fights using these numbers. Taking sensible gambles with an edge over time is similar to investing. But if I’ve made a mistake somewhere, those same gambles without an edge become sucker bets.
