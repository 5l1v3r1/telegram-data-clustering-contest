      <p>Ernesto Valverde has opted to make changes to his side for Barcelona's league game at Levante following the 5-1 win over Real Valladolid in midweek.</p>
      <p>The Barcelona coach has brought Sergi Roberto, Arthur Melo and Antoine Griezmann into the side as the Catalans look to strengthen their grip on top spot.</p>
      <p>Sergi Roberto comes in at right-back, with Nelson Semedo swapping to left-back and Jordi Alba, who picked up a knock in midweek, only on the bench. Junior Firpo is not even in the squad.</p>
      <p>Arthur, meanwhile, replaced Sergio Busquets in the side. He plays in a midfield three alongside Frenkie de Jong and Arturo Vidal, who starts for the second game running.</p>
      <p>Finally, Griezmann is back in the starting lineup alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. Ansu Fati drops to the bench, where he's joined by Carles Perez.</p>
      <p><b>Full Bar√ßa team: </b>Ter Stegen, Sergi Roberto, Pique, Lenglet, Semedo, De Jong, Arthur, Vidal, Messi, Suarez, Griezmann.</p>
