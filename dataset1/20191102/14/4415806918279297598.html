      <p>Overcrowding at the psychiatric unit of University Hospital Waterford is not a recent issue.</p>
      <p>That is according to the chair of the Waterford Branch of the Psychiatric Nurses Association (PNA).</p>
      <p>Pictures highlighted by the Irish Examiner this week showed patients sleeping on floors and chairs at the hospital because of a lack of available beds.</p>
      <p>Leish Caulfield says there is a capacity for 44 beds in the unit but patient numbers have been higher than this for some time.</p>
      <p>"We have found an ongoing situation which has been constant and consistent over two years which we have had up to 54 patients within that 44 bed capacity," said Ms Caulfield.</p>
      <p>"It is something that is absolutely intolerable.</p>
      <p>"It is a situation which has been ongoing which is why the Psychiatric Nurses Association took the decision 22 months ago to enter into industrial action over the issue."</p>
      <p>Ms Caulfield said that the unit has to provide a service that is up to standard and says that that standard is not being met.</p>
      <p>"This issue of over-capacity and the over-reliance on our acute inpatient services has been highlighted for many, many months to senior management, to the HSE and to our governing body.</p>
      <p>"This is not something that happened today or yesterday, this has been building."</p>
      <p>The Irish Medical Organisation said that the crisis in the psychiatric unit in Waterford is common across the country.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Dr Martin Daly, a member of the IMO's GP committee, says this problem exists in many psychiatric units.</p>
      <p>"Psychiatric services have always been the Cinderella of the medical services in the health service," said Dr Daly.</p>
      <p>"It would appear that psychiatric patients and patients who need mental health services are at the lowest order of priority in the health service.</p>
      <p>"What is happening in Waterford is something that is reflected throughout the country.</p>
      <p>"There is a lack of capacity both for inpatient treatment and also in the community."</p>
      <p>Dr Daly said that they are "sorely lacking" in the services that they can provide people.</p>
      <blockquote>People need to remember that we will all require mental health services and care at some point in our lives.</blockquote>
      <p>"It is a really poor reflection on the priorities of the health service that vulnerable people are forced to lie on floors in an inpatient unit in Waterford."</p>
