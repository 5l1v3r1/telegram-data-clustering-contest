《我們之間：薩提爾模式婚姻伴侶治療》：別將對父母未滿足的期待，放在伴侶身上
02 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是在處理夫妻或伴侶之間未滿足的期待時，治療師需要與當事人區辨：有哪些期待是童年成長過程中針對主要照顧者或父母的，這些都與眼前的這位伴侶無關、他也無法實現。

將對父母未滿足的期待放在伴侶身上
生命是豐富又繞富趣味的寶藏，尤其伴侶關係常如照妖鏡般把我們底層不為人知的面相反映出來，更加凸顯人與人關係所蘊含的多樣與複雜。這在伴侶兩人初識、瞬間進入熱戀、愛情濃得化不開時，就已現出端倪。許多人的一見鍾情，常常是因對方讓自己一見如故，有一種似曾相識，好像在那裡見過的熟悉感。這種強烈的吸引力，極易使雙方在最短的時間內就陷入戀愛無法自拔。此時雙方都以為找到了夢中情人，不需要再花功夫認識對方，但其實兩人都可能正將自己內在潛意識中，小時候的烙印、未解決的情結、和未滿足的期待，投射在對方身上而不自知（Satir, 1983）。
很多在浪漫期的情人相信一切都是美好的，即使有不滿意，會預設結婚以後就會迎刃而解；結婚後發現解決不了，就告訴自己，有孩子之後所有問題都不是問題了。所以很少有人會理性冷靜的去探究：你和我到底是怎樣的一個人？我們的原生家庭對親密關係有什麼影響？我們各自有哪些未滿足的期待來自過去成長的背景？有哪些因文化、個性、價值觀等因素造成彼此的差異？……
此時兩人是在跟自己想像出來的夢幻伴侶相愛，而未看清楚對方的真實面貌，如同在空白銀幕上，映射出自己以為的伴侶圖像卻非真正的他。直到有一天浪漫期過去，才逐漸發現，伴侶原來跟自己所想要的標準差距甚大，因此對他和對自己都大失所望，一種難以言喻的憤怒油然而生，隨即啟動兩人之間意想不到的戰爭。
這些現象很普遍，也常是夫妻或伴侶衝突無法解決的關鍵。深究之後，發現很多深層隱藏的差異性所造成的衝突，往往來自彼此的期待不同，有些是根值於童年時期對父母未滿足的期待，兩人因未曾覺察而產生內心深處巨大矛盾的動能，這些說不出的苦即形成相處的鴻溝和溝通的障礙。
童年的期待是如何帶到親密關係的？
夫妻或伴侶在親密關係中對彼此有期待是再自然不過的事了。這些期待很多是從過去生命的家庭和社會系統中，與他人、與自己相處的經驗所累積而來的：
1. 對父母未滿足的期待
最常見的是，年幼時對父母的期待未能得到滿足，而將之放在伴侶身上。當年對父母的期待落空，在內心深處所造成的缺憾，使人感覺自卑、悔恨、失望、傷心、憤怒；嚴重者產生一生不可磨滅的傷痛，於是帶著這些尚未紓解的強烈情緒長大。
成年之後在親密關係中，如果伴侶未能滿足這些源自於小時候未滿足的期待，例如，期待父母（伴侶）說些讚賞正向的話來得到認可、期待父母（伴侶）專心耐心的陪伴、期待父母（伴侶）擁抱、期待父母（伴侶）主動表達愛和關心、期待父母（伴侶）不要偏心是公平的、期待父母（伴侶）傾聽和理解等，所有這些從小累積對父母的期待，以及因為當時父母未實現而產生的情緒，經常在伴侶不知情也未能做到時爆發，因此引起關係中不可預知的大大小小戰爭。
2. 來自文化社會的影響
有些期待則源自我們成長過程中關於性別、價值觀、生活、權力等方面的刻版化印象，是社會和文化的影響所發展而來。例如：男性是家中主導者，女人應該順從他；女人要溫柔體貼、善於家務；媳婦應該孝順公婆不應該忤逆犯上；男人要養家活口擔當所有經濟責任；男人應該事業有成，在家做家庭煮夫很丟臉；伴侶間永遠都要浪漫激情，否則就不是愛；男主外女主內；家庭主婦應該要打掃得一塵不染等。其他如生活中常遇到的澆花、關燈、倒垃圾、家事分工、金錢、性、養兒育女、對關係的承諾、溝通和互動的品質等，每對夫妻和伴侶對彼此的期待都不相同，不但因人而異，也因兩位伴侶不同的家庭、族群、宗教、文化背景的薰陶，存在很大的差異。這些來自文化社會的影響，滲透在家庭教育中，再經由父母長輩的身教言教，自然而然內化成每個人獨特的信念和觀點，長大後即自動發展成各種對伴侶和子女的期待。
3. 來自父母或其他重要家族成員的期待
父母對子女有期待乃是天經地義的事，這是因為多數父母都帶著關心和愛，希望他們的子女能做到最好。這些期待隨著子女們逐漸長大慢慢會被調整，但也有些父母未能適應子女的成長，仍執著於不合時宜的期待。然而，即使父母未能有彈性地調整對子女的期待，成年後的子女仍然可以為自己的人生做主，選擇適合自己的期待去完成，而非停留在孩童的狀態，完全以父母的要求為生命重心。當一個人將父母的期待一直背負在自己身上，成年之後又放在伴侶或孩子身上，要求他們和自己務必達到時，會使他自己和家人感覺到無比沉重的壓力。
舉例來說，有一對父母年輕時候生活困苦，女兒長大後殷殷期盼她能嫁入有錢有勢的豪門。所以千方百計阻撓女兒與現在的先生結婚，後來發現女兒懷孕了，只好含著眼淚把女兒交給女婿。沒想到真的應驗了父母所擔心的。結婚後，他們的生活過得很艱難困苦，女兒因此覺得很對不起父母，心中充滿愧疚，又因為罪惡感、痛苦、沮喪加深而得憂鬱症。她只要想到自己的婚姻就止不住的後悔、加上對父母強烈的愧疚感，因此更加怨恨和瞧不起先生，生活中不斷找先生麻煩跟他吵架。直到做了婚姻治療後，才發現因為他們達不到女方父母的期待變得有錢有勢，這位成年的女兒一直背負著讓父母失望的巨大罪惡感無法消化，於是轉嫁到先生身上，強力壓迫先生能升官發財，否則她會因為失去父母的認同，感覺自己是沒有價值的人；她的先生如果不能讓她父母滿意，就是個失敗者。這位妻子發現自己因執著於滿足父母的期待而傷害了對方、也傷害婚姻，這番新的領悟，使她有機會重新為自己和婚姻思考未來新的方向。
期待落空造成親密關係的深層痛苦
將小時候對父母未滿足的期待帶到成年後的生活中並執著於此，很容易使自己陷入心靈的捆綁中，也造成伴侶沉重的負擔，因此消耗兩人大量的能量，產生許多深層無法言喻的痛苦，使自己的身心靈和親密關係都付出巨額代價（Satir et al., 1991）。
在第5章中，我們由薩提爾模式內在冰山的隱喻可了解，期待是一個人希望對方做的一些具體行動，以滿足內在被愛、被肯定、安全、被尊重等深層渴望。雖然每個人都有普同性共同擁有的渴望，但期待伴侶能實現和滿足渴望的具體行為則各有不同。然而重要的是，當彼此間的期待不能被滿足，不論原因為何，都很容易因期待落空而觸動深層強烈的情緒（Satir et al., 1991）。
這些對父母未滿足的期待，有些是當年父母不知道也未達成的；有些是自己不知道也未曾覺察的；還有些是自己已知道，但成年後要決定是否堅持下去的。這些懸而未決的期待，如果不去面對好好處理，不只會使個人內在深層渴望落空，也會造成自我價值感低落。
很多人帶著這樣的失落、受傷和低自我價值感進入婚姻或伴侶關係，希望伴侶能滿足他這些小時候的期待，以填滿心中的空虛和失落，他才能因此成為一個完整的個體。但伴侶並不知道自己已被賦予這樣的重責大任而未做到時，即使得帶著期待的當事人，不斷感覺期待落空的失望、傷心、被忽略、和憤怒。伴侶也被他的情緒牽動，感到挫敗無力，兩人之間就這樣無止境的痛苦掙扎著。
在薩提爾模式中，非常重視人與人之間的期待如何影響親密關係，尤其是小時候對主要照顧者的未滿足期待，治療師會將之慎重提出來，與夫妻或伴侶們開放和具體的討論，其他治療學派則鮮少會關注這個重點。薩提爾模式治療師常鼓勵來訪者，承認並擁有這些小時候未滿足的期待後，再決定是否要放下、或不放下它們。這個過程可以釋放來訪者被壓抑的能量，讓他由禁梏中解放出來，然後產生改變行動和發展新的可能性（Gomori & Adaskin, 2009）。
一位妻子小時候強烈渴望父親能在她身邊陪伴她，讓她感覺有依靠和安全感，她期待父親當年能讓她坐在腿上抱著她、看著她，溫柔地跟她說話，使她覺得倍受寵愛和有安全感。然而當年父親忙於家計，常常在外奔波賺錢，回到家已三更半夜倒頭就睡，遑論可以滿足她這些特定的期待。當她長大結婚後，則一直懷抱著這些對父親未滿足的期待，希望先生為她做到，她才相信先生是真正愛她的。而她的先生剛好從小被訓練要獨立自主，不可留露情感，更不可有身體接觸，認為這些都是低能的表現。他的父親是警官，恨鐵不成鋼，認為男生都要剛強獨立，不准他有一點情緒流露，要絕對理性冷靜。所以他從不擁抱、不分享感受，並與家人疏離，免得被父親羞辱。當他結婚之後，帶著這些習慣與妻子相處時，他不喜形於色，很討厭近距離的身體接觸，因為會使他渾身不自在。所以每當妻子要靠近他、坐在他腿上，他就很自然的用力推開她，讓她與他並肩而坐，以保持他舒適的距離。妻子越是黏上來，他就越推卻，久而久之妻子就因為越來越挫敗受傷，而認定先生是不愛她的。直到在婚姻伴侶治療中，他們澄清了這些過去原生家庭的影響，才開始更深入認識彼此。妻子逐步意識到，先生不喜歡身體接觸其實有其背景根源，不代表他不在乎她、不愛她或想拒絕她，而是他感覺不舒服。她發現對先生要求坐在他腿上才感覺被愛，是源自小時候對父親的期待時，她即意識到這些期待是屬於她的、不屬於她的先生。在了解先生的成長歷程後，她可以體諒這對先生太困難、也太沉重了。雖然先生表達愛的方式無法滿足她小時候對父親的願望，但她可以鬆動這些期待並在其他方面體會先生的關愛。先生則表示，雖然他不喜歡妻子像無尾熊一樣黏坐在他腿上，但這不表示他不在乎她，他只是從無與人身體接觸的習慣，這會讓他渾身不自在引起更多反感。他會做家事、上班接送她、陪她聊天、很有耐心地聽她訴苦、在家做飯給妻子和女兒等，這些是他表達關愛的方式。如果她真的想要身體接觸，他可以肩並肩跟她坐在一起試著用手摟著她，他也願意一步步學習擁抱她或握著她的手。如果女兒坐在他腿上他可以接受，但若是一個成年女性坐在他腿上就會感覺很不舒服。此時她豁然開朗，願意將對父親未滿足的期待放開，不再執著於勉強先生達成時，他們都鬆了一口氣，反而彼此身心更能靠近和連結了。
在處理夫妻或伴侶之間未滿足的期待時，治療師需要與當事人區辨：有哪些期待是童年成長過程中針對主要照顧者或父母的，這些都與眼前的這位伴侶無關、他也無法實現。當事人現在已長大成人，這些期待在當年雖然都非常重要，也深具意義，因為是他經驗自我價值的重要根源，但現在的情境、年齡、對象和關係狀態都與當年不符合了。藉著這些有意識的區辨和覺察，可讓當事人更多處在當下，並看清楚自己的伴侶是誰。
在薩提爾模式中，我們會欣賞這樣珍貴的覺察，並帶著善意和關愛，回顧當年的父母如何盡力做到他們能做的，和他們如何影響現在的伴侶關係。所以治療師和當事人將帶著一個重要的信念：我們雖然不能改變原生家庭和父母，也無法改造在原生家庭所發生的事件，但可以轉化原生家庭對我們所造成的衝擊，也可以用新的方式來應對（Satir et al., 1991）。
雖然父母當年不能滿足我們所有期待，但我們會由父母身上學到許多美好資源，豐富人生和親密關係。所以在此部分的探索，我們會把婚姻伴侶治療的焦點放在當年未滿足的期待對現在親密關係的影響，而不會將治療的重心放在批評和檢討父母的缺失，這個做法是許多新手治療師很容易迷失之處。
尤其需要注意的是，探索其中一位伴侶的原生家庭時，很容易越走越深，使得整個治療過程只著重在這位伴侶身上，讓另一位被冷落，這是治療師需要盡量避免的陷阱，以免將婚姻伴侶治療變成其中一位伴侶的個人治療。

親密關係不僅僅是柴米油鹽，而是人生中最好的機會，去遇見自己和對方真實的自我，滿足彼此內在深處最核心的渴望。它會激發一個人內心最脆弱的部分，因此也是最容易受傷和最可以療傷的地方。──成蒂

曾有人說，我們處在一個「愛無能」的世代，但或許我們只是把愛想得太簡單了，沒有意識到它是需要學習的。
親密關係是許多人一生都渴望的經驗，但它卻常常令人充滿挫敗感，好像無論怎麼努力，都達不到心目中那種剛剛好的狀態。這是因為當兩個獨立的人要經營「我們」這種共同關係時，背後其實牽涉四重系統的交互磨合──文化社會系統、個人內在系統、伴侶互動系統、原生家庭系統。它們環環相扣、彼此糾纏，不時讓關係陷入錯頻與失望。但只要願意透過薩提爾模式的歷程學習一致性的真誠了解、共同面對與承擔，就會看見全新的可能。
本書作者成蒂老師逾三十年來深耕薩提爾模式婚姻伴侶治療，師從維琴尼亞・薩提爾、瑪莉亞・葛莫利與約翰・貝曼，更曾擔任瑪莉亞・葛莫利的助教。她結合實務經驗與所學，搭配精彩案例及示意圖，介紹婚姻伴侶治療的理論內涵與歷程工具，解說深入探索和轉化親密關係中個人內在系統、伴侶互動系統、原生家庭系統的具體方法。
薩提爾模式與華人重視家庭關係和凝聚力的價值觀相近，貼近人們內在心路歷程、重視治療師在人性層面與來訪者的連結，並能涵容當代多種治療如人本心理治療、精神動力、正念減壓、後現代主義治療等的理念與技術。相信任何心理學背景的讀者均可從本書中找到資源，使自己的專業實踐更加豐富和深入。
「治療師的成長是個永不停歇的過程，轉化性的治療則是內在深處靈性的歷程。本書作者成蒂已與我深入地學習了二十七個年頭，她從未停止學習、成長和體現出如上所述的治療師的最佳典範。」──瑪莉亞・葛莫利（Maria Gomori）／家族治療大師

""Between us: Satyr model marriage partner treatment"": Don't put your parents' unmet expectations on your partner
02 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is that when dealing with unmet expectations between couples or partners, the therapist needs to be identified with the client: what expectations are for the primary caregiver or parent during the child's growth, which is in front of the eyes He has nothing to do with his partner.

Put your parents’ unmet expectations on your partner
Life is a treasure that is rich and interesting. In particular, the relationship between partners is often reflected in the under-recognized face of the bottom, which highlights the diversity and complexity of the relationship between people. This is already the clue when the two of the partners first met, instantly entered the love, and the love was too strong. Many people fall in love at first sight, often because the other party makes themselves see each other, there is a sense of familiarity, as if they have seen the familiarity there. This kind of strong attraction makes it easy for both parties to fall in love in the shortest possible time. At this point, both sides thought that they had found a dream lover, and they didn't need to spend time to know each other. But in fact, both of them may be projecting their inner subconsciousness, the branding of the childhood, the unresolved complex, and the unsatisfied expectation. Without knowing it (Satir, 1983).
Many lovers in the romantic period believe that everything is good. Even if they are dissatisfied, they will pretend to be solved after marriage. If they find that they can't solve it after marriage, they will tell themselves that all problems are not a problem after having children. So very few people will rationally and calmly explore: What kind of person are you and me? What is the impact of our native family on intimacy? What unsatisfied expectations do we each have from the background of past growth? What are the differences between cultures, personalities, values and other factors? ......
At this time, the two are in love with the dream partner they imagined, but did not see the true face of the other party, as on the blank screen, mapping the image of the partner they thought was not true. It was not until one day that the romantic period passed, and it was gradually discovered that the partner had a very different standard from what he wanted, so he was disappointed with him and himself, and an indescribable anger came into being, and then unexpectedly started between the two. war.
These phenomena are common and are often the key to a couple's or partner's conflict. After a thorough investigation, it is found that many conflicts caused by deep hidden differences often come from different expectations. Some are the unsatisfied expectations of parents in their childhood, and the two people have kinetic energy that is deeply contradictory because they have not been aware of them. These unspeakable sufferings form a gap between communication and communication.
How does childhood expectation lead to intimacy?
It is only natural that couples or partners have expectations of each other in intimate relationships. Many of these expectations have come from the experience of others and their own experience in the family and social systems of past lives:
1. Unsatisfied expectations of parents
Most often, when you are young, your expectations for your parents are not met, and you put them on your partner. When the expectations of parents fell through, the shortcomings caused by deep feelings made people feel inferior, remorse, disappointment, sadness, and anger. In severe cases, they produced an indelible pain in their lives, and they grew up with these strong emotions that have not yet been relieved.
In adulthood, in the intimate relationship, if the partner fails to meet these unsatisfied expectations from childhood, for example, expect parents (partners) to say positive appreciation to be recognized, expect parents (partners) to concentrate on patiently, expectation Parents (partners) hug, expect parents (partners) to actively express love and care, expect parents (partners) not to be eccentric, fair, expect parents (partners) to listen and understand, all of which accumulate expectations of parents from childhood, and because Emotions that are not realized by parents are often erupted when the partner does not know and fails to do so, thus causing unpredictable wars of magnitude and size in the relationship.
2. Influence from cultural society
Some expectations are derived from the imprinted impressions of gender, values, life, power, etc. in our growth process, which are the result of social and cultural influences. For example, a man is the dominant person in the family, a woman should obey him; a woman should be gentle and considerate, be good at housework; a wife should be filial to her in-laws and should not be rebellious; a man should raise a family and bear all economic responsibilities; a man should have a successful career and be a family cook at home. Very shameful; partners must always have romantic passion, otherwise it is not love; male and female outside the female; housewives should be cleaned and spotless. Others, such as watering flowers, turning off lights, dumping garbage, family division, money, sex, raising children, commitment to relationships, communication and interaction quality, etc., every couple and partner look forward to each other. Not the same, not only varies from person to person, but also because of the different families, ethnic groups, religions, cultural backgrounds of the two partners, there are great differences. These influences from the cultural society are infiltrated into the family education, and then through the teaching and teaching of the parents and elders, they naturally become the unique beliefs and opinions of each person. When they grow up, they automatically develop into various expectations for their partners and children.
3. Expectations from parents or other important family members
It is a matter of fact that parents have expectations of their children. This is because most parents have care and love and hope that their children can do their best. These expectations will gradually be adjusted as children grow older, but some parents are unable to adapt to their children's growth and remain obsessed with outdated expectations. However, even if parents fail to flexibly adjust their expectations for their children, the children in adulthood can still take care of their own lives and choose the expectations that suit them. Instead of staying in the child's state, they are completely dependent on their parents' requirements. Focus. When a person puts his or her parents' expectations on themselves, and puts them on a partner or child after adulthood, asking them and themselves to reach them, it will make him and his family feel extremely heavy pressure.
For example, when a parent is young and has a hard time, her daughter grows up and hopes that she can marry a wealthy and powerful giant. Therefore, every effort was made to obstruct her daughter from marrying her current husband. Later, she discovered that her daughter was pregnant and had to hand her daughter to her son-in-law with tears. I did not expect to really fulfill the concerns of my parents. After they got married, their lives were very difficult and difficult. The daughter felt very sorry for her parents. Her heart was full of embarrassment, and she became depressed because of her guilt, pain and depression. As long as she thinks about her marriage, she can't stop regretting it, and she has a strong sense of guilt about her parents. Therefore, she is more resentful and disdainful. In her life, she constantly finds trouble with her to quarrel with him. It was not until after the marriage treatment that they found that they became rich and powerful because they could not reach the expectation of the woman’s parents. The adult daughter had been burdened with the great guilt of disappointing her parents, so she was transferred to Mr. The oppressor can promote the rich, otherwise she will feel that she is worthless because she loses her parents' approval; her husband is a loser if he can't satisfy her parents. The wife found herself hurting her partner and hurting her marriage by obsessing her parents' expectations. This new insight gave her a chance to rethink her and her marriage in a new direction.
Looking forward to the deep pain of intimacy
Bringing the unsatisfied expectation of parents to the life of adulthood and obsessing with it, it is easy to get yourself into the bundle of the soul, and also cause a heavy burden on the partner, so it consumes a lot of energy for the two people, resulting in many deep incomprehensible The pain of making a lot of money for the body and mind and intimacy (Satir et al., 1991).
In Chapter 5, we can understand from the metaphor of the iceberg in the Satyr model. Expectation is a specific action that one wants the other party to do to meet the deep desire of being loved, affirmed, safe, and respected. Although everyone has the desire to share commonality, the specific behaviors that expect a partner to achieve and satisfy a desire are different. What is important, however, is that when expectations between each other cannot be met, regardless of the cause, it is easy to touch deep and intense emotions due to expectations (Satir et al., 1991).
Some of these unsatisfied expectations of parents were not realized by parents at the time; some did not know or were aware of them; others still knew that they had to decide, but they decided to stick to them in adulthood. These unresolved expectations, if not dealt with well, will not only make the individual's inner deep desire to fall, but also cause a low sense of self-worth.
Many people enter the marriage or partnership with such loss, injury and low self-worth. I hope that the partner can satisfy his childhood expectations and fill in the emptiness and loss of the heart, so that he can become a complete individual. However, when the partner does not know that he has been given such a heavy responsibility and fails to do so, the party with the expectation is constantly feeling disappointed, sad, neglected, and angry. The partner is also affected by his emotions, feels frustrated, and the two struggle with such endless pain.
In the Satyr model, it is very important to pay attention to how the expectations between people affect intimate relationships, especially the unmet expectations of the primary caregivers when they are young. The therapist will be cautiously raised, open and specific with the couple or partners. Discussions, other therapeutic schools rarely pay attention to this focus. Satyr mode therapists often encourage visitors to recognize and have these unmet expectations of their childhood before deciding whether to let go or not. This process releases the energy that the visitor is suppressed, frees him from imprisonment, and then creates change and develops new possibilities (Gomori & Adaskin, 2009).
When a wife was a child, she was eager for her father to be with her, and she felt that she felt dependent and safe. She expected her father to let her sit on her lap, hold her, look at her, and gently talk to her to make her I feel very pampered and safe. However, when his father was busy with his family, he often went out to make money. When he returned home, he fell asleep in the middle of the night. Public opinion can satisfy her specific expectations. When she grew up, she always had these unsatisfied expectations for her father. I hope that Mr. will do it for her. She believes that Mr. really loves her. And her husband was trained to be independent since he was a child. He should not be exposed to emotions, and he should not have physical contact. He believes that these are low-energy performances. His father is a police officer. He hates iron and does not become a steel. He believes that boys must be strong and independent. They are not allowed to have a little emotional expression. They must be absolutely rational and calm. So he never embraces, does not share feelings, and alienates from his family, lest he be humiliated by his father. When he got married and took these habits with his wife, he didn't like it, he hated close physical contact, because it would make him uncomfortable. So whenever the wife wants to be close to him and sits on his lap, he naturally pushes her hard and lets her sit side by side with him to keep him comfortable. The more the wife sticks, the more he pushes. The wife who has been over for a long time is more and more frustrated and hurts, and she believes that the husband does not love her. It was not until the marriage partner treatment that they clarified the influence of these past native families that they began to understand each other more deeply. The wife gradually realized that the husband does not like physical contact and actually has its background. It does not mean that he does not care about her, does not love her or wants to reject her, but he feels uncomfortable. She found that when she asked to sit on his lap and felt loved, it was from the childhood expectation of her father that she realized that these expectations belonged to her and did not belong to her husband. After understanding Mr.'s growth process, she can understand that this gentleman is too difficult and too heavy. Although Mr.'s way of expressing love cannot satisfy her childhood wishes to her father, she can loosen these expectations and experience the care of her in other ways. Mr. said that although he does not like his wife to stick to his lap like a koala, it does not mean that he does not care about her. He just has no habit of touching the body, which will make him feel uncomfortable and cause more dislike. . He will do housework, pick up her at work, chat with her, listen patiently to her complaints, cook at home, and give her wife and daughter. These are the ways he expresses love. If she really wants physical contact, he can sit side by side with her and try to slap her with her hand. He is also willing to learn to hug her or hold her hand step by step. If the daughter is sitting on his lap, he can accept it, but if an adult woman sits on his lap, it will feel very uncomfortable. At this time, she suddenly became cheerful and willing to let go of her father's unsatisfied expectations. When she was no longer obsessed with the achievement of Mr. Qiang Qiang, they all breathed a sigh of relief, but they were closer to each other and connected.
In dealing with unmet expectations between couples or partners, the therapist needs to identify with the client: what expectations are for the primary caregiver or parent during the child's growth, which is not related to the partner at the moment, nor can he achieve. The parties have grown up now. These expectations are very important and meaningful in the past, because they are an important source of their self-worth, but the current situation, age, object and relationship status are not in line with the current year. Through these conscious districts and awareness, the parties can be more in the moment and see who their partner is.
In the Satyr model, we will appreciate such precious insights, and with goodwill and care, we will look back on how parents did what they could do and how they affected their current relationships. Therefore, the therapist and the client will carry an important belief: although we can't change the original family and parents, we can't change the events happening in the original family, but we can transform the impact of the original family on us, and we can also use the new one. Ways to deal with (Satir et al., 1991).
Although our parents could not satisfy all of our expectations in the past, we will learn many wonderful resources from our parents and enrich our lives and intimacy. Therefore, in this part of the exploration, we will focus on the treatment of marriage partner in the impact of the unmet expectations of the year on the current intimate relationship, and will not focus on the criticism and review the lack of parents, this practice is many newcomers The therapist is easily lost.
In particular, when exploring a partner's native family, it is easy to go deeper and deeper, so that the entire treatment process only focuses on the partner, leaving the other person to be left out, which is what the therapist needs to avoid. Trap, so as not to turn the marriage partner treatment into a personal treatment for one of the partners.

Author: Cheng Di

Intimacy is not only the rice and oil, but the best opportunity in life, to meet each other and the true self of the other, to meet the core desire of the deepest inside. It provokes the most vulnerable part of a person's heart and is therefore the most vulnerable and most healing place. ─ ─ idi

It has been said that we are in a generation of ""love incompetence"", but perhaps we just think of love too simple, not realizing that it needs to learn.
Intimacy is an experience that many people have longed for, but it is often frustrating. It seems that no matter how hard they try, they can't reach the state of being just right. This is because when two independent people want to manage the common relationship of ""we"", the reality involves the interaction of the four systems - the cultural and social system, the personal internal system, the interactive system of partners, and the native family system. They are interlocking and entangled with each other, and from time to time let the relationship fall into the wrong frequency and disappointment. But as long as you are willing to learn from the Satyr model through a sincere understanding of common understanding, face to face and commitment, you will see new possibilities.
The author of the book, Mr. Cheng Ti, has been deeply involved in the Satyr model of marriage partner therapy for more than 30 years. She studied with Vicenza Satyr, Maria Gomeri and John Berman, and even served as Maria Ge. Molly's assistant. She combines practical experience and learning, with wonderful cases and schematics, introduces the theoretical connotation and process tools of marriage partner therapy, and explains the specific methods of in-depth exploration and transformation of personal internal systems, partner interaction systems, and native family systems in intimate relationships.
