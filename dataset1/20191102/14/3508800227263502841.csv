02 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是據說，這個世上有三尊佛陀加持過的等身像，一尊消失，一尊在拉薩的大昭寺，另一尊在菩提迦耶的正覺塔。祂們是佛教徒心中的無價之寶，或說見到等身佛就如同見到佛陀。

遇見等身佛
據說，這個世上有三尊佛陀的等身像，這三尊出自同源，曾由佛陀親自加持開光，一尊是七世紀初尼泊爾的尺尊公主嫁給吐藩王松贊干布時，攜同入藏的八歲等身佛，這尊八歲佛像被供奉在大昭寺；另一尊十二歲等身佛是文成公主要嫁給藏王松贊干布時，由長安帶往藏地的嫁妝，這尊佛像當時被安奉在小昭寺，藏人稱之為「覺沃佛」。
文成公主在唐太宗貞觀年間入藏，到唐中宗時，藏王赤德祖贊再向皇朝求親，迎娶金城公主為妻，金城公主嫁到西藏後，把文成公主帶去供在小昭寺的十二歲等身佛和大昭寺尺尊公主的八歲等身佛對調。後來小昭寺數度遭到火災，八歲等身佛也消失於世，而在大昭寺的十二歲等身佛歷經政治變亂，被僧人掩藏在壁洞裡多時。文革結束，遭到破壞的大昭寺，經過一段時間的修復後，重新開放，藏人們才得以見到在他們心目中，雪域最神聖的「覺沃佛」。
宗薩欽哲仁波切在他的著作《朝聖》一書的開頭，敘述一則藏人阿班和覺沃佛之間的故事，阿班從小就非常仰慕在拉薩的覺沃佛，也同其他的藏民般，懷抱一生中至少去朝聖一次的心願，因著他的虔敬心，他終於成行，從居住地藏東康區遠行來到拉薩，並在寺廟四處無人時，直接來到十二歲等身佛像前，和他心儀的覺沃佛發生一段超越感知的美妙經驗。
讀到這一段故事，我的念頭也跟著回到大昭寺，二○一一年夏天，我們到拉薩去看曬佛節，下飛機後直接來到八廓街，先到唐卡店參觀，看著店裡幾位年輕的唐卡師傅在大小不一的畫布前，凝神畫出複雜的色澤和宗教圖像；然後穿行在人氣聚集的街上。走走看看，是為了適應高山上相對稀薄的空氣，緩緩走到大昭寺附近，氣氛乍然熱鬧起來，聚集的攤商賣著各種日常用品或古玩，我的目光被賣藏香的小攤吸住，而旁邊賣珊瑚瑪瑙綠松石的地攤前，聚著幾個討價還價的觀光客。迎面而來的是僧人、朝拜者、轉經者；康巴漢子身形彪悍，蓄著及肩黑髮，黑髮上用紅綿繩繫住，讓人一眼看出他們和阿班同樣從藏東來的。
穿過嘈雜的市集，走到大昭寺，在入口的廣場前，有不少藏人正此起彼落地做著大禮拜，他們雙手套著木板進行磕長頭，當雙手觸地，手板發出清脆的聲響，就像一記記節奏規律的樂音。寺前左右兩根高高的經幡柱，繫著一圈圈的風馬旗，仍不斷有人前來掛旗。我看到在入口處前排隊等候進寺的人群，或持念珠唸唸有詞，或提裝酥油的水瓶，我揣想，這些人當中必然也有像阿班一樣的，窮其一生都要來禮敬「覺沃佛」的吧。
一夜休息，隔晨，我們重回八廓街，穿過露天的熱鬧市集，和放生羊擦身而過，直接前往大昭寺，準備入寺參觀，大昭寺是一座融和漢印的藏式建築，已被列入世界文化遺產，它的金頂在朝陽的映照下，顯得氣勢非凡，白色牆上的八吉祥標誌出藏傳佛教的聖物，由犛牛毛織成的黑色門帘垂掛，顯得門後的深不可測。除了金頂下的佛殿，大昭寺內還有其他的院落、經堂、展示廳，規模甚大，難以細細飽覽，大多數的朝聖者或許和我們一樣，最大的目標就是十二歲等身佛像。
隨著人潮踏入大殿，看到的是傳統的藏廟殿堂，長條的格局，中間走道的兩旁分列兩排矮桌，矮桌上有經本、法器，是僧人念經、學習、法會之處，大殿的主尊是未來佛，未來佛是彌勒佛，相傳祂是下一個降生的佛，時間在幾億年後的末劫時代，這是我初次看到金剛乘中的未來佛像。大昭寺大殿供奉的是尊巨大的未來佛，金身佛像頭戴寶冠，面容莊嚴如滿月，雙眉間有白毫，鳳眼紺目，眼神慈悲的垂望眾生，朱唇飽滿呈現相好的特徵，讓人難忘。
不過我只能短暫瞻仰，因為腳步被後繼的朝聖人群簇擁著往前移。接續穿過幾個殿堂，進入一個甬道，甬道旁有個十二歲等身佛過往藏身的窄仄壁洞，我跟在人們的身後探頭看著，通過了甬道，便來到等身佛前。這尊等身佛由文成公主帶入西藏，至今已在拉薩供奉一千多年，相傳祂是根據十二歲悉達多太子的神貌做的，鎏金坐姿的等身佛像戴著佛冠，冠帶和金色華服飾綴各種珍貴寶石，十分華麗，佛的面容靜好，紺目朱唇，頷首和信眾的目光相接。佛前供著一排排由金盞盛著的酥油燈，和佛殿輝映出一片片金光色澤。
見到十二歲等身佛的當下，我並沒有太多的感覺，畢竟彼時我是旅客，不是去朝聖。不過當晚，初履聖地的我，卻做了一個吉祥夢，夢中清楚地感知大昭寺的未來佛來看我，我見佛到，笑到嘴角收攏不回，直到後來聽見佛離去的聲音後方醒。
隔天，我將這個夢境告訴了無神論的室友，她以一種讓我自慚的神情回說：「你會相信這種事啊？」雖然夢中情景如實，但我從此再也不敢提起，姑且當它如同阿班故事中的一段超越感知經驗。
二○一七年初，我第四次到菩提迦耶參加祈願法會，法會的空檔，大家都把握時間前往正覺塔繞塔，正覺大佛在佛教徒的心中具有相當尊崇的地位，因為相傳世上的三尊等身佛像之一，就是供奉在正覺塔的，有一說是佛陀二十五歲，也有說是三十五歲的等身像，不過結跏趺坐的正覺大佛氣宇軒昂，身形比例比凡人大上許多，前往禮拜時，並不會特別和等身佛做聯想，只會被佛像三十二相好的面容攝受，感受到佛陀的慈悲與智慧，只想多看一眼，多禮拜一次，但是這樣的心情通常不太能滿願，因為佛殿窄狹，只容兩人側身，來自各地的朝聖者鎮日如潮水湧入，加上保安人員的催促，每個人的腳步很難不跟著快快移動。為了多瞻仰正覺大佛，我有時出了佛殿，旋即又到人龍的後頭排隊，重新進入。
禮敬過正覺大佛後，通常就能安住腳下，開始繞塔。我常在繞塔時和美芬不期而遇，從第一次到菩提迦耶認識美芬後，平時分住不同國度的我倆，每年都會像侯鳥般在聖地相遇，隱約中得知她和一兩個很接近的法友們上過正覺塔的二樓，聽說不對外開放的樓上有很多寶物，不過關於這樣的訊息通常是秘而不宣的。
一天我們在旅店小坐，和我同行的慧忽然迸出「聽說有人去申請，上到正覺塔的二樓」，我望了美芬一眼，她說「不是每個人都上得去的」，大家都聽懂這關乎個人的修持和因緣，不過當下仍決議一試，請慧當代表，隔天去寺務中心申請。
沒想到隔天慧竟然出乎意表，順利地申請到上正覺塔二樓的許可，她興奮地描述，當她跟辦事的南傳僧人提出要申請到二樓參觀時，僧人掀眼看了她一下，什麼話也沒說，就給她一個時間，要我們在那個時間到正覺塔內等。聽到事情進行得這麼順利，已上去過的美芬說：「不是每個人都上得去的，大家太有福報了。」
我們一行包括我和姊姊、美芬、慧和她好友，依照時間在下午三點前，身著白衣，手捧香花等在正覺塔裡的一旁，正覺大佛依然莊嚴慈悲地目視川流的朝聖者，接納每個人的祈願。我們等著，看不出任何相關的跡象，也意識到擋到別人通路的尷尬。三點多，有個南傳僧人手持一串鑰匙進入，得知我們的來意，他用眼神示意我們跟著他，迅速踏上牆旁一座平時看似廢棄的舊梯，爬到二樓出了梯口，是個平台，因為塔身還有裝修的鷹架，一行人走在平台上不太被看見。他說明，我們只能停留三十分鐘，還有些禁止的事項，然後我們便進入正覺塔二樓的正殿。
正殿前方供奉的是我久違的未來佛，鳳眼紺目，朱唇飽滿，金身處處流露出相好，距大昭寺後，這是我們的再度重逢，如今我不是旅客，而是朝聖者。佛殿右方是一尊佛陀三十歲的立像等身佛，金身的等身佛高約六米，那是佛陀剛脫離王室出家不久，短髻，年輕的容顏英氣煥發。我們相繼匍伏佛的足下，供花、頂禮，環視周圍，除了我們幾人，只有一個南傳僧侶在角落禪坐。
在這麼難得能得，殊勝的情境當中，不到三十分鐘，該如何把握呢？我們幾乎不假思索地一致在現在佛和未來佛的座下打坐。忽忽中聽到腳步聲起，我張眼一看，領我們上來的僧人已準備帶我們離開，我注意到自己帶來，供在佛前的鮮花盤上，不知何時增添座小舍利塔，心中明白那是美芬供養的。置身在未來佛和三十歲等身佛中，當下在我的感知，眼前恍惚是一座須彌山。
離開大塔，走回旅店途中，大家的心情都很愉悅，我跟美芬說，我看到未來佛的當下，第一個念頭是「我認得您的」，然後跟她提起在拉薩夢到未來佛的那一段經驗，信仰堅定的她回說：「你看到的應是祂的報身。」這次我沒有自慚的感覺。
據說，這個世上有三尊佛陀加持過的等身像，一尊消失，一尊在拉薩的大昭寺，另一尊在菩提迦耶的正覺塔。祂們是佛教徒心中的無價之寶，或說見到等身佛就如同見到佛陀。初始不明所以的我，竟在因緣際會下，得以一一遇見珍貴的等身佛，我想我是幸運的。

Yang Jinyu, ""The Ganges in the Fog"": Meet the Buddha
02 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is that there are three statues that the Buddha has blessed in this world, one disappearing, one in the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, and the other in the tower of the Bodh Gaya. They are invaluable treasures in the hearts of Buddhists, or they are like seeing Buddhas when they see the Buddha.



Text: Yang Jinyu
Meet the Buddha
It is said that there are three statues of Buddha in the world. These three are from the same origin. They were once blessed by the Buddha. One is the eight-century princess of Nepal who married the spit king Songtsan Gambo. The old-aged Buddha, the eight-year-old Buddha statue was enshrined in the Jokhang Temple; the other 12-year-old Buddha was the dowry that Chang Cheng brought to Tibet when Wen Chenggong was mainly married to the Tibetan king Songtsan Gambo. In the Jokhang Temple, Tibetans call it ""King Buddha"".
Princess Wencheng entered Tibet during the Emperor Taizong's reign of Emperor Taizong. In the Tang Dynasty, the Tibetan King Chi Dezuzan asked the emperor to ask for a kiss. He married the Princess of Jincheng. After the Princess Jincheng married Tibet, he brought Princess Wencheng to the 12th in the Jokhang Temple. The old-aged Buddha and the eight-year-old princess of the Jokhang Temple ruled the Buddha. Later, the Xiaozhao Temple was fired several times, and the eight-year-old Buddha disappeared into the world. The 12-year-old Buddha in the Jokhang Temple experienced political chaos and was hidden by the monks in the wall for a long time. At the end of the Cultural Revolution, the ruined Jokhang Temple, after a period of restoration, was reopened, and the Tibetans were able to see the most sacred ""Women Buddha"" in their minds.
In the beginning of his book ""Pilgrimage"", Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche described the story between a Tibetan Aban and Awaken, and Aban was very admired in Lhasa from childhood, and also with other Like a Tibetan, he embraced his wish to go to the pilgrimage at least once in his life. Because of his kindness, he finally made a trip and went to Lhasa from the Dongkang area where he lived in Tibet. When he was nowhere in the temple, he came directly to the twelve. Before the Buddha statue, he and his favorite Wuwo had a wonderful experience of transcending perception.
After reading this story, my thoughts also returned to the Jokhang Temple. In the summer of 2011, we went to Lhasa to see the Sun Buddha Festival. After getting off the plane, we went directly to the Barkhor Street and first visited the Thangka shop. In the store, several young Thangka masters painted complex colors and religious images in front of the canvas of different sizes; then they walked through the popular streets. Looking around, it is to adapt to the relatively thin air on the mountain, and slowly walked to the vicinity of the Jokhang Temple. The atmosphere was so lively. The gathering vendors sold all kinds of daily necessities or antiques. My eyes were sold to the Tibetan stalls. Sucking, and in front of the turquoise agate stall selling coral agate, gathered a few bargain tourists. Oncoming people are sluts, worshippers, and turners; the Kangbahan are in shape, with black shoulders and black hair tied with red cotton ropes, which makes people see that they are the same as Aban. From the east of Tibet.
Passing through the noisy market and walking to the Jokhang Temple, in front of the entrance to the square, many Tibetans are doing their best to go to the ground. They are wearing gloves and wooden boards for long heads. When the hands touch the ground, the hands are issued. The crisp sound is like a rhythm of rhythm. Two tall prayer columns in front of the temple are tied with a circle of wind horses, and people are still coming to hang flags. I saw people waiting in line at the entrance waiting to enter the temple, or holding a rosary to read a word, or a bottle of ghee, I think, these people must also have the same as Aban, the poor have to come to court Worth.
Resting overnight, every morning, we return to Barkhor Street, pass through the lively market in the open air, pass by the release sheep, go directly to the Jokhang Temple, and prepare to enter the temple. The Jokhang Temple is a Tibetan building that blends with Han and India. It has been included in the world cultural heritage. Its golden dome is in the face of the rising sun. It looks extraordinary. The eight auspicious flags on the white wall mark the sacred objects of Tibetan Buddhism. The black curtains woven by yak hair are hanging behind the door. Unfathomable. In addition to the Buddhist temple under the Golden Summit, there are other courtyards, halls and exhibition halls in the Jokhang Temple. The scale is very large and it is difficult to enjoy the details. Most of the pilgrims may be like us. The biggest goal is to wait for the Buddha statue at the age of twelve. .
As the crowd enters the hall, we see the traditional Tibetan temple hall, the long strip pattern, the two sides of the middle walkway are divided into two rows of low tables, the low table has the scriptures, the implements, is the monk chanting, learning, the Fa Conference Wherever, the main lord of the main hall is the future Buddha. The future Buddha is Maitreya Buddha. It is said that He is the next born Buddha. The time is in the last era of hundreds of millions of years. This is the first time I saw the Buddha statue in Vajrayana. The Jokhang Temple main hall is dedicated to the great future Buddha. The golden Buddha statue wears a crown, and the face is solemn as a full moon. There are white feathers between the eyebrows, eye-catching eyes, eyes and compassionate lookouts, and the lips are full of good features, making people unforgettable. .
However, I can only pay a moment to see it, because the footsteps are swarmed forward by the pilgrimage crowd. Continued through several halls and entered a ramp. There was a narrow cavern at the turn of the 12-year-old who was hiding in the past. I followed the people and looked at the probe. After passing the ramp, I came to wait for the Buddha. This statue of Buddhism was brought to Tibet by Princess Wencheng. It has been worshipped in Lhasa for more than a thousand years. According to legend, he is based on the appearance of the 12-year-old Prince Siddhartha. The band and the golden costumes are adorned with a variety of precious gems, which are very gorgeous. The Buddha's face is quiet, eye-catching, dagger and the eyes of the believers. In front of the Buddha, there is a row of butter lamps adorned by the golden dragonfly, and the Buddha Hall reflects the golden color.
When I saw the current age of twelve, I didn’t feel much. After all, I was a passenger, not a pilgrimage. However, on the night, I had made an auspicious dream in the first place, and I clearly saw the future Buddha of the Jokhang Temple. I saw the Buddha, and I laughed until the corner of my mouth was closed, until I heard the sound of the Buddha’s departure. wake.
The next day, I told this dream to the atheist roommate. She said back to me with a look that made me feel self-satisfied: ""Do you believe this kind of thing?"" Although the dream scene is true, I never dare to mention it again. When it is like a section of the Aban story, it transcends the perception experience.
At the beginning of 2017, I went to Bodhgaya for the fourth time to participate in the Prayers' Faculty. In the gap of the Fa Conference, everyone took the time to go to the Zhengju Tower to revolve around the tower. Zhengda Buddha has a very respectable position in the hearts of Buddhists. It is said that one of the three statues of the Buddha in the world is enshrined in the Orthodox Tower. One said that the Buddha is twenty-five years old, and that it is said to be a thirty-five-year-old figure, but the sacred statue of the sacred buddha is so arrogant. The proportion of the figure is much larger than that of the mortal. When going to worship, it will not be specially associated with the Buddha. It will only be photographed by the 32-faced face of the Buddha. I feel the compassion and wisdom of the Buddha. I just want to take a look. Once in a week, but this kind of mood is usually not very fulfilling, because the temple is narrow and narrow, only two people can be sideways. The pilgrims from all over the country are flooding into the town, and with the urging of security personnel, everyone’s footsteps are very It’s hard not to follow the move quickly. In order to pay more attention to the Buddha, I sometimes went out of the temple and immediately lined up at the back of the dragon and re-entered.
After paying homage to the Buddha, you can usually settle down and start to wrap around the tower. I often met with Meifen when I was around the tower. From the first time I went to Bodhgaya to know Meifen, we usually lived in different countries. Every year, we met in the Holy Land like a migratory bird. One or two close friends have been on the second floor of the Zhengjue Tower. I heard that there are many treasures on the upstairs that are not open to the public, but such information is usually secret.
One day we sat down at the hotel, and Hui, who was with me, suddenly said, ""I heard that someone applied to go to the second floor of Zhengjue Tower."" I looked at Meifen and said, ""Not everyone can go."" Everyone understands that this is related to personal cultivation and karma, but the current resolution is still a question, please Hui representative, the next day to apply to the temple center.
I didn’t expect that every other day, I was surprised to apply for permission to go to the second floor of Shangzhengjue Tower. She was excited to describe that when she and the Nanchuan monk who asked for the job asked to apply to visit the second floor, the monks stared at her. If you don’t say anything, give her a time, and let us go to the Zhengjue Tower at that time. I heard that things went so smoothly. Meifen, who has been there, said: ""Not everyone can go up, everyone is too blessed.""
Our party includes me and Miao, Meifen, Hui and her friends. According to the time before 3 pm, dressed in white, holding fragrant flowers, etc. in the side of Zhengjue Tower, Zhengjue Buddha still looks solemnly and compassionately. Pilgrims, accepting the prayers of everyone. We waited, we didn't see any relevant signs, and we were aware of the embarrassment of blocking the passage of others. More than three o'clock, there is a Nanchuan monk holding a string of keys to enter, to know our intentions, he used his eyes to indicate that we followed him, quickly stepped on the wall next to an old ladder that seems to be abandoned, climbed to the second floor and went out of the ladder. The mouth is a platform, because the tower has a decorated scaffolding, and the pedestrians are not seen on the platform. He explained that we can only stay for thirty minutes, and there are some prohibited things, then we will enter the main hall on the second floor of the Zhengjue Tower.
The front of the main hall is dedicated to my long-lost future Buddha. The eyes of the phoenix eye are full of eyes and the lips are full. The golden body is everywhere. After the Jokhang Temple, this is our reunion. Now I am not a passenger, but a pilgrim. On the right side of the Buddhist temple is a statue of a Buddha who is 30 years old. The body of the Buddha is about six meters high. It is the Buddha who has just left the royal family and is short-lived. The young face is full of heroism. We have been squatting at the foot of the Buddha, offering flowers, ceremonies, and looking around. Apart from a few of us, there is only one southern passer who sits in the corner.
In such a rare and rewarding situation, in less than thirty minutes, how to grasp it? We almost did not hesitate to meditate in the present Buddha and the future Buddha. Suddenly I heard the sound of footsteps. I opened my eyes and saw that the monks who brought us up were ready to take us away. I noticed that I brought them to the flower tray in front of the Buddha. I don’t know when to add a small stupa. That is Meifen's support. In the future Buddha and the 30-year-old Buddha, the moment in my perception, the front is a Sumi Mountain.
When I left the big tower and walked back to the hotel, everyone was very happy. I told Meifen that I saw the future of the Buddha in the future. The first thought was ""I recognize you,"" and then mentioned to her in Lhasa dreaming about the future. In the experience of the Buddha, she firmly said, ""You should see his report."" I didn't feel guilty this time.
It is said that there are three statues of Buddha in the world that have been blessed, one disappears, one is in the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, and the other is the Orthodox Tower in Bodhgaya. They are invaluable treasures in the hearts of Buddhists, or they are like seeing Buddhas when they see the Buddha. I was unclear at the beginning, but I was able to meet precious Buddhas one by one under the circumstance, I think I am lucky.

In the era of consumption, literature inevitably loses the dimension of spiritual transcendence. Fortunately, Endo’s novels and Yang Jinyu’s essays have repeatedly reminded us that in the secular world of camps, there is still a bright light that shines on the world. ——Zheng Zhengheng
""The Ganges in the Mist"" is a road sign that the mother pursues all the way. The footprints are recorded. She remembers the philosophers and the masters who describe the Fa, and the descriptions of the friends, and talks about the late Qing women who lead themselves into the doctoral research.
