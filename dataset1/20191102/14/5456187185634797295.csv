NEW YORKÂ (AP) - When he came to the United States as a refugee from Syria during that country's bloody civil war, there was a lot Diaa Alhanoun didn't know, starting with English.
There was one thing he was fairly certain of, though - whatever else the future held in store for him and his family, he was pretty sure it was going to include food, a constant in his life since he had left school at 15 to work in an uncle's restaurant in Damascus.
He's working in a restaurant these days - his own. Along with a partner, Alhanoun, 48, is the chef behind the recently opened Sakib, a small corner outpost on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood, where he turns out the Mediterranean food he learned to cook as a teen.
""I have this idea, I wait for I learn English, I see how people eat,"" Alhanoun said in the sometimes-halting English he's learned since his arrival in October 2016. ""Before I come here, I think future, I want restaurant.""
Food has taken him all over the world - he helped open a restaurant in Russia in his 20s and another a few years ago in Sudan, along with catering work he did while living in Syria. His maternal grandfather had a restaurant, as did five of his mother's six brothers, including the one where he learned to cook.
Alhanoun left Syria in 2012 for his restaurant opening in Sudan, but by the time he tried to go back some months later, fighting had broken out in Damascus.
He sold that business and fled to Jordan with his wife, children and other relatives, then came to the U.S. through a United Nations program that helps displaced persons re-settle in other countries.
Today, Alhanoun lives on Staten Island with his wife and children, ages 18, 17, 9 and almost 2.
He spent two months working at a hat factory, but food once again came calling, and he started working in a restaurant.
Alhanoun was introduced to Eat Offbeat, a catering company that hires refugees and teaches them culinary skills, and offers their recipes in the food available to customers. Through Eat Offbeat, Alhanoun participated in events like the Refugee Food Festival, where he was able to cook a meal in a restaurant kitchen.
Alhanoun is the first from Eat Offbeat to open his own operation.
""Since the first day he joined, we knew Diaa was going to get his own place at some point,"" said Manal Kahi, co-founder of Eat Offbeat. ""We're all super proud of him, it's a great example for everyone else at the kitchen.""
Fighting in his old home, Damascus, has largely ceased since the Syrian army drove rebels from areas around the city a year ago, but it remains economically devastated by the war.
Alhanoun said he initially thought the strife wouldn't last and he would be back in Syria in only a matter of months. But his focus now, he says, is on his new home and the possibility of opening more restaurants
Of all the places he's lived, Alhanoun thinks New Yorkers have liked his food the most, and he's hopeful about what the future could hold as he builds a new life here.
His dream now? A big restaurant, that holds a lot of people, and a good future for his children.
""I hope people like it, my food,"" he said, ""...and kids, studying good.""

How and where to make real scotch whiskey
Scotch is made from barley, but this is far from the main ingredient.

02 Nov 2019, 14:29

More importantly, Scottish air, water and courage. ""Around the World"" went to Highland to try the components of the famous whiskey separately and together.
- On the way from the airport, you probably saw cows of Aberdeen-Angus breed, the very ones from which meat the best marble steaks are made all over the world. They were brought here in Scotland in the 19th century. Here we have the lamb no worse - Ken Lindsay, dressed in a festive kilt with tailcoat and bow-tie, sits at the head of the table, living in the role of the hospitable host of the castle Linn House. Ken, a specialist in whiskey with 30 years of experience, can tell everything about a noble drink. But right now he is more interested in food.
- So, our cooks select the best pieces of lamb and ... throw them in the trash! And from what remains, prepare haggis.
The joke was a success, but the laughter quickly subsides when the chef makes the main dish of Scottish cuisine. On a snow-white napkin, a swollen lamb stomach sways. Scraps of the esophagus and duodenum are tied with twine. Not without pleasure Ken reports that the shaking dirty gray bag is full of giblets (otherwise the guests suddenly thought that they were meat).
To try haggis, you need to catch courage. Everything is ready for this: there is a quake in front of each eater - a low copper bowl of 50 milliliters filled with whiskey. Ken explains the procedure step by step. Holding the quake in front of you at chest level, you need to shout âWell, wait!â - something like âYour health!â In Gaelic (Scottish). Then you should drink whiskey in one gulp, shake the inverted bowl over your head and kiss the bottom of it. Guests are animated. We are close to such rituals: exhale, knock over, bite. âLate wa, Ken, cut your haggis!â
But cutting early, the Scot has not yet finished playing. He wants to read us an ode to the haggis written in the 18th century by Robert Burns. I am sitting on the corner of the table, closest to Ken, and in a posed voice he pokes obscure Gaelic words directly into my left ear. Having pulled out a dagger from behind a golf course, he rips open his stomach in one motion, from which soaring gray minced meat falls out on a napkin. Ken performs a couple of ballet steps, is behind me and puts a dagger to my throat, growling something about the enemies of Scotland.
So much for the immersive performance. I did not serve in the special forces, and I do not have the accumulated reflex of throwing an attacker over my head and making an appointment for finishing. And if there was? However, the Scots are not shy guys.

BOTTLE

Octane number
Even single malt whiskey is mixed from dozens of barrels before bottling. So manufacturers achieve a uniform taste of the drink from different bottles and batches. The stronger the drink ripening in the barrel, the more taste it takes away from the tree, but the more volume it loses during evaporation. The ""Gold Standard"" is considered a fortress of 60 degrees. Before bottling, whiskey is diluted with ordinary water to the traditional 40 degrees. Although there are undiluted varieties marked cask strength.

Courage

We stand in a clean field in the middle of the hills. A stone sign says that here in 1824, George Smith founded The Glenlivet Distillery. There is slush underfoot, a gloom above the head, the wind penetrates, the drizzle is not the best place for walking. The privacy of this region enjoyed the first Scottish whiskey. For several centuries, whiskey in Highland (in the Highlands) was produced illegally.



Demand for alcohol in this region has always been. Still, with such a climate! The production of spirits was taxed heavily. In order to properly pay tribute, the whiskey of the densely populated Lowland (Southern Scotland) drove whiskey hastily in huge quantities. The fiery swill had almost no taste, but pleased ordinary people and filled the royal treasury with a coin.
In the Glenlivet Valley, sheltered by the hills, whiskeys were made slowly, for themselves and for their own. Taxes were not paid - tax collectors rarely made it to these places. The local viscura could afford experiments with the recipe. They made aged whiskey, not chasing volume, and the drink turned out to be soft, aromatic. Illegal carriers distributed the product among connoisseurs.
Despite the conspiracy, the rumor of a soft Highland whiskey spread across the British Isles. In 1822, during an official visit to Scotland, King George IV demanded a drink from the Glenlivet Valley. ""Lord Coninham, the chief chamberlain, everywhere looked for pure Glenlive whiskey, the king drank nothing else,"" wrote Elizabeth Grant, a writer in Lady Highland's Memoirs. Soon after this, the monarch turned to the Excise Chamber with a request for leniency to viscomers. At the same time, the landowners of Highland were convincing the parliament of their ability to take control of the regionâs alcohol market and bring it back to normal.
Tax breaks didnât seduce viscomers and smugglers accustomed to absolute freedom, and the region for some time turned into a hot spot. Old-timers did not want to cooperate with the authorities and did not let ârightâ newcomers into their lands. George Smith, the founder of the first legal distillery in the Glenlivet Valley, always carried a pair of pistols behind his belt and often used them.
Today, the Smugglers Trail is just a tourist route with a start from the very stone with a sign. Those who are not afraid of cold and damp can walk through the hills and appreciate the beauty of Scottish nature, its unusually rich colors. The flowers are dark yellow, like amber backlit by the sun. The grass is dark green, as if fluorescent. The slopes are strewn with white ""dandelions"", which suddenly begin to move and turn out to be sheep.
Translated from Gaelic, Glenlivet means ""valley smoothly flowing."" The smoothly flowing River Livet flows into Avon, a large tributary of the Spey River, which gave the name to the Speyside region. This is one of the six districts of whiskey production in Scotland, very modest in area, but leading in the number of distilleries. It makes the most famous varieties in the world. Overall, little Scotland produces most of the world's whiskey. Why exactly her? Because it can. In few places there is still so much suitable water.

Water

âIf you donât like the weather in Scotland, just wait five minutes,â Ken recounts the old joke, and before our eyes the rain is replaced by the sun, and after a couple of moments it starts to drizzle again. Water in Highland seems to be everywhere: underground, in lakes, in the air. And this is very helpful: a large distillery needs 10,000 liters per hour.
To make whiskey, you need two types of water: drinking and technical. The first is in direct contact with barley and yeast, absorbing alcohol and aromatic substances. The initial taste of water is practically not transmitted whiskey. But yeast should like it.
Yeast processes dissolved sugar in wort into alcohol, while they themselves need calcium and magnesium. The law governing the recipe of Scotch whiskey prohibits the addition of special nutritional components for yeast to water, which means that minerals must be present in it initially. Drops of rain filling underground sources pass through the thickness of soil and are saturated with mineral substances.
- Why do you think whiskey is expensive? - asks Ken. - Not at all because of the penny barley - the land near the sources is very expensive.
The well, from which George Smith took water, even has his own name: Josieâs Well, or âJosieâs Springâ. Today it is a local attraction with a fence and a sign.
Industrial water is needed primarily for cooling alcohol vapors after boiling in a distillation cube. A cube is the same moonshine still, only large, and its cooler is arranged similarly: a copper pipe-coil is immersed in a container with running cold water. The volume of this ""aquarium"" can be significant, a million liters or even more. Cooling water does not come in contact with whiskey, and it can be taken not only from the well, but also from a river or lake, and returned there.



The water temperature must be stable. It depends on how quickly the steam turns into liquid in the coil and how long the product is in contact with copper. This greatly affects the taste of whiskey. In rare cases, when relatively hot and dry summers come to Highland, distilleries stop working and close for maintenance.
Going around the pond and touching the water (brr!), We go into the barn, where almost finished whiskey is gaining taste in barrels. Through the cracks in the plank walls light breaks through. There is no wind here, but the nose itches from the cold air.
- Thought here to warm up? Whatever the case, Ken chuckles. Now air has to do its job.




TECHNOLOGIES

Long process

1. Germination

Barley grains contain starch, sealed by cell membranes and protein structures. A series of soaks and dryers mimics a spring thaw, and the seeds germinate. Starch is released to nourish the sprout.

2. Drying

So that all starch is not consumed, the growth process must be stopped. Grain is gradually heated up to 90 Â° C in special furnaces.

3. Crushing

Sprouted and dried grain is ground to malt. In the next step, the crushed husk of the seeds will serve as a filter, and how rich the wort will depend on the quality of the grinding.

4. Wort production

Malt is poured with hot water. It activates natural enzymes that break down starch into sugars. The procedure is carried out at least three times. The first water has a temperature of about 62 Â° C, the second - 75 Â° C and the third - 95 Â° C.

5. Fermentation

Yeast is added to the wort, which processes sugar into alcohol. The resulting mash resembles beer.

6. Distillation

Braga is heated in a distillation cube. Alcohol boils and evaporates before water at a temperature of 78.4 Â° C. Vapors are cooled in the coil and again become liquid. After the first distillation, the product acquires a strength of about 20â30 Â° Ð¡. The second distillation brings the degree to 60 and above.

7. Exposure

By law, Scotch whiskey does not ripen in oak barrels.less than three years. At the same time, barrels can be very different: from American or European oak, from bourbon, sherry and even wine.

Air

âWe call this antique device a copper dog,â Mr. Lindsay demonstrates a golden cylinder swaying on a chain. - Now I will lower it into a barrel of whiskey, and we will take a sample. Attention, please complete silence!



Ken covers his eyes and gently immerses the cylinder in his temples. Music comes out of the barrel! It was as if someone had played an arpeggio on a marimba or rang a dozen bells. These gas bubbles hit the cylinder like little hammers. Where are the bubbles in whiskey from? The drink contains volatile components that evaporate over time.
âThis is theâ share of the angel, âKen explains. - Every year, 3% of the volume of whiskey seeps through the pores in the barrel tree. Guess why aged drinks are so expensive? And we also have to plan the demand for 15, 20 and even 30 years in advance. Who knows how much people will love whiskey in three decades?
Due to pressure differences, substances escaping from the barrel are replaced by air. During the interaction of the drink with oxygen, acids are formed, and they, in turn, react with alcohol and turn into esters - carriers of a fruity taste.
Changeable weather contributes. When the air in the barn warms up, the wood pores expand, and the whiskey itself slightly increases in volume, snuggling closer to the tree. With cooling, the pores are compressed, and the tree assimilates the whiskey accumulated in itself, stimulating numerous chemical reactions.
***
Finally, we walk along the barley fields. We donât run, we donât mince and donât wrap ourselves in hoods: a person quickly gets used to any weather, including Scottish. We are thinking of walking the path of smugglers: some two hours in the hills.
- Guess why Scotch whiskey is made from barley? - even removing the kilt and butterfly, Ken Lindsay continues to play the role of the host and entertain guests with riddles. - Yes, just other cereals do not grow in such a climate. Would there be wheat, would drive out of wheat, would there be corn - from corn. Grain is the tenth matter.
