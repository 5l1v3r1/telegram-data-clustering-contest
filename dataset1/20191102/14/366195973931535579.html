      <hr/>
      <p><a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/wiki/profile">Wiki</a> has released a handful of fire singles leading up to the release of his upcoming album <i>OOFIE</i>. As if "Eggs," "Fee Fi Fo Fum" and "Smarty Jones" weren't enough, the New York rapper just dropped off another banger at the buzzer. "Pesto," accompanied by a music video, has Wiki dropping bar after bar over a heavy-hitting, Tony Seltzer produced beat. While it's got a high energy vibe, the lyrics sometimes contrast with lines like "Went from jumping on fucking futons til my crew gone/Reviews strong, not enough views on the songs."</p>
      <p>Filmed mostly with a green hue, the video dresses Wiki as an old school style gangster- suit, fedora and all. All-in-all, it's simple but strong; a solid compliment to the song. Check out "Pesto" below and listen to <i>OOFIE</i> when it drops on November 8th.</p>
      <p><b>Quotable Lyrics</b>:</p>
      <p>Damn, your hand swipes slow, while I get dough<br/>Y'all ain't even got inside that turnstile yet, yo<br/>Let go, ain't you seen, turn my style pesto<br/>Green this, green that, green fit, green hat</p>
