02 Nov 2019, 14:22

Главный тренер ""Трактора"" Петерис Скудра подвел итог игры с ""Автомобилистом"" (3:5).""Много играли в атаке, много бросали. Тем не менее, для нашего состава это очень хороший матч, несмотря на то, что мы проиграли. ""Автомобилист"" - опытная и мастеровитая команда, которая использовала свои моменты в атаке, это и стало решающим моментом. Мы довольны игрой, несмотря на результат, ребята молодцы.Почему так много травм? Это хоккей, ребята бьются, пассажиров нет. Может, кто-то выйдет после паузы на Евротур. Надеемся, что Бэйлен выйдет, может, Гика появится. Остальные, наверно, попозже"", - сказал Скудра.

Next week, the Ukrainian delegation in Brussels will discuss a wide range of issues of cooperation with the European Union.
The fifth meeting of the Ukraine-EU Association Committee, which will be held on November 5 in Brussels, is an important event that will strengthen the dynamics of relations with the European Union. This was stated by Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine Dmitry Kuleba, the press service of the Cabinet of Ministers said on Saturday, November 2.
According to him, during the events within the framework of the Committee’s meeting, professional contacts will be established between representatives of the new Ukrainian authorities and EU institutions, in particular, the European Commission. They will also discuss ideas for further integration, which will form the basis of documents that will be adopted by the Association Council in December.
""We have every reason to say that the intensity of the Ukraine-EU dialogue will only increase,"" Kuleba said.
In addition, a wide range of issues related to political, economic and sectoral cooperation will be discussed at a meeting of the Committee. A separate block will be devoted to monitoring the implementation of the Association Agreement and updating the annexes to the Agreement.
It is noted that the Association Council in December plans to summarize the previous achievements of Ukraine towards approaching the EU and expand integration processes. It is expected that concrete joint steps will be taken to further Ukraine's sectoral integration into the digital and individual energy markets of the EU, simplification of the terms of trade with the EU, in the field of justice, freedom and security, as well as obtaining ""industrial visa-free"" (ACAA agreement).
Earlier, Prime Minister of Ukraine Alexey Goncharuk informed the European Commission of Ukraine’s intentions about EU membership. According to him, in five years Kiev wants to get as close as possible to EU membership and confirms intentions with actions.
Recall that President Vladimir Zelensky confirmed Kiev’s course towards European integration, saying that, unfortunately, not all European countries want to see Ukraine as a member of the bloc.
It was also reported that Ukraine leads the world in a positive attitude towards the EU. Ukraine is the fourth among respondents. According to the study, in Ukraine 79% of respondents are positive about the European Union.
