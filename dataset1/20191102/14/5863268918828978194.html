      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) â€“ The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has recommendation the federal government of Pakistan to establish the Federal Revenue Agency to collect taxes from across the country.</p>
      <p>The global moneylender believes that collection of taxes will be more efficient if the revenue agency is formed and maintains that it should collect taxes at provincial and district level.</p>
      <p>Thereby, taxpayers will not have to travel to federal, province and district tax offices and all taxes at federal, provincial and district level will be collected at the same place.</p>
      <p>The IMF has further recommended that the center could return the taxes to the provinces and districts after collecting it at one place.</p>
      <p>In Pakistan, taxpayers are required to fill 47 tax forms and so it is essentially required to simplify tax forms filling and submission process and its collection.</p>
      <p>With the recommendation, the IMF maintains that any form of tax can be collected at any tax office across the country.</p>
