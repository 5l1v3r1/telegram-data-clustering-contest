      <h1>Alex Neil in Stoke City wrangle as Preston allege illegal approach</h1>
      <h2>Nathan Jones was sacked on Friday following their poor start to the season.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T14:35:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 14:35</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Stoke City have targeted <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alex-neil-footballer">Alex Neil</a> to become their next manager after the sacking of Nathan Jones - but Preston have denied them permission to speak to the former Hamilton boss.</p>
      <p>Jones was dismissed on Friday after their poor start to the season and the Potters are quickly looking to bring in a replacement.</p>
      <p>Preston North End boss Neil is reportedly at the top of their shortlist, but according to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50274819">BBC</a> an approach has been rejected.</p>
      <p>Stoke could also face possible sanctions, with Preston alleging that an illegal approach has been made for their manager.</p>
      <p>The Championship outfit had hoped to hold talks with Neil over the vacant position by Monday after Preston take on West Brom this weekend, but that is now in doubt as relations between the clubs break down.</p>

      <p>Neil has helped steer Preston to second position in the table after a brilliant start to the campaign.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stoke-city-fc">Stoke</a> , on the other hand, are rooted to the bottom which led the club to relieving Jones of his duties.</p>
      <p>Neil, born in Bellshill, managed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hamilton-academical-fc">Hamilton</a> in 2013 for two seasons before taking charge of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/norwich-city-fc">Norwich</a> and then joining Preston.</p>
