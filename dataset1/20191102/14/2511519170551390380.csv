Roma host Napoli in Serie A this afternoon as the two Italian heavyweights clash for the first time this season.
Roma will be hoping to leapfrog Atalanta into third place as they look to maintain their bright start to the current campaign. On Wednesday night they thrashed Udinese 4-0, while last weekend they saw off AC Milan at home.
Napoli will meanwhile be without manager Carlo Ancelotti on the touchline, after he was shown a red card in the club’s 2-2 draw with Atalanta. A win would see Napoli leapfrog Roma and move into fourth – follow live coverage below.
Roma vs Napoli teams    •  Roma: Lopez; Spinazzola, Smalling, Cetin, Kolarov; Mancini, Veretout; Zaniolo, Pastore, Kluivert; Dzeko.   •  Napoli: Meret; Di Lorenzo, Manolas, Koulibaly, Rui; Callejon, Fabian Ruiz, Zielinski, Insigne; Mertens, Milik.

Show latest update2019-11-02T14:32:37.120ZRoma 1-0 Napoli 28' - Great clearance by Smalling, hooking the ball away a yard before the goalline as Di Lorenzo's header looped toward goal. Insigne then races in behind the Roma defence and strikes goalward, but it's wide. Better from the away side.

2019-11-02T14:29:20.070ZPENALTY SAVED! Kolarov goes low to the keeper's right, but Meret makes a brilliant one-handed save. Going to put that down as a tremendous use of VAR, on this occasion! Still Roma 1-0 Napoli.

2019-11-02T14:16:19.263Z​Roma 0-0 Napoli 12' - Mancini flicks a lovely ball into the area, but Pastore blazes over under pressure from Manolas. Pastore is certainly making the most of the injuries in the Roma squad; he played just under 600 league minutes last season and, if he plays the full 90 today, will already be on 377 for 19/20.
