Trump: Obama builds ISIL

02 Nov 2019, 14:35

US President Donald Trump reiterated that former US president ""made ISIL"" at a rally in Mississippi on Saturday morning.
In a speech to Republican supporters in the US town of Toplow, US President Barack Obama again acknowledged that US President Barack Obama had formed an ISIS terrorist group, referring to the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. .
In his speech, Trump initially attacked his Democratic opponents as well as the American media affiliated with his opponents and attacked their positions on the Ukraine Gate case and the impeachment of the US president. ""We need honesty in our media, we need honesty,"" the US president said, accusing the opposition media of lying, corruption and affiliation with the ""Clinton, Bush, and Obama families."" ""You probably heard the news that we were kicked out of the White House,"" Trump's hallmark of boycotting Trump, defending his government's move to deny reporters in the New York Times and Washington Post. ""I'm wondering which of the two is worse than the other, they are fiercely in competition for bad media, they are fake, and I think they are corrupt,"" Trump said. In rejecting the New York Times and the Washington Post against his government, the US president cited Washington's claim of killing ISIL, adding: ""You never see a good report (about the Trump administration) even when we received al-Baghdadi and the Washington Post. He published a report and wrote that he was like a wonderful religious cleric. Where did this word come from? "" ""Look, if Obama had done this (the alleged operation to kill al-Baghdadi), well, this person (Obama) built the ISIL caliphate,"" Trump said. ""If I were a Democrat, they would have been talking about this story for weeks, but because of my footing, they even tried to diminish the importance of it,"" the US president said, criticizing the lack of news about the alleged death of ISIL. ""If Obama had such a story, they (the US media) would have been talking about it for seven months, talking about his courage,"" he said. When Trump was a Republican presidential nominee on August 1, President Trump, along with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and his Democratic rival, was founding ISIS. In a speech to Republican supporters in Fort Lauderdale, he said in a speech at the time: ""ISIL is respecting and honoring President Obama. He is the founder of ISIL and helped ISIL. I also say that Hillary Clinton was a trickster, and (along with Obama) was the founder of ISIS. "" Source: Fars
