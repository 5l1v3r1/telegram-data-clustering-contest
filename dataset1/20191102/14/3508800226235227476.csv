吳鈞堯《重慶潮汐》：介壽路上的情書
02 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是是介壽路也好、是凱達格蘭大道也罷，在這條大道上有愛國行動、自力救濟，以及各種訴求的靜坐。活動過後，路又乾乾淨淨，帶著點無情、疏離，不干己事的模樣。



文：吳鈞堯
介壽路上的情書
我並未意識到自己在等。
我坐在戲院鬆塌的椅子，眼睛微瞇。觀眾陸續走進，持可樂、零食，徐徐入座。戲院的燈光像霧後月色，有一點昏黃、一些朦醉，彷彿它必須營造夢一般的色彩，才合乎電影的本質：「如真似幻，似假還真」。我還有一個「小人心思」，戲院若不把燈光調暗，飲料汙漬、陳年口香糖殘渣等，都會一一入目。燈光把它們都抹化了，如同再過一會，它要用喜劇、悲劇等，讓我們又笑又哭。
燈光暗了，代表電影即將播放。電影院時常充當政令宣傳據點，六○年代播放「禁止隨地大小便」，七○年代宣導「遵守紅綠燈」，八○年代推廣生育政策—「一個不嫌少，兩個恰恰好」。再來是電影預告，忽然竟打出了「本片開始」的字幕。
我推了推同伴手臂，狐疑問，「國歌呢？」我習慣等待〈國歌〉，為一部電影啟動。那時候，喝飲料的、嚼零食的，都得趕緊起立，等待〈國歌〉唱畢，才能安座，享受一部電影。我會跟同伴說，「注意看喔，國歌裡頭有兩個景點，我曾經去過。」我語帶炫耀、榮耀，彷彿我也是歷史的一部分。
台灣的〈國歌〉是「中國國民黨黨歌」，它的前兩句是，「三民主義，吾黨所宗」，造成政黨的認同問題。在跨年活動，尚未成為人潮、錢潮的大匯聚時，台北、高雄與台中等城市，都沒有跨年活動，而由元旦升旗典禮掛帥。二十一世紀以後，跨年奪了元旦風采，但升旗依然辦理。有一年，為鼓勵民眾參加，人氣尚旺的國民黨祭出參加者，贈與國旗圍巾等文創產品，各家媒體爭播民眾排隊、熱鬧領取贈品的畫面。
媒體還促狹地捕捉國民黨之外的政治人物，會跟著唱〈國歌〉嗎？很多政客避唱〈國歌〉前兩句。〈國歌〉歌詞第一句是「三民主義」，又被稱為「三民主義歌」。歌曲先有詞而後有曲，歌詞又叫「黃埔軍校訓詞」或「總理訓詞」，是孫中山在一九二四年六月十六日，黃埔軍校開學典禮上發表的訓詞。
就讀國小時，老師曾說過〈國歌〉的軼聞，情節是〈國歌〉參加某項國際比賽，且打敗各國，以優美旋律獲得「金牌」。事在七○年代，中國與台灣國力都羸弱，〈國歌〉得金牌，不失為民族士氣的鼓舞。不過後來發現，〈國歌〉獲得殊榮是真有其事，不只是民族自信的打氣機。一九三六年，奧運在德國舉行，希特勒深信最優秀的民族自是日耳曼人，連國歌也不例外，強力安插國歌競賽。揭曉後，卻是當年遭受列強荼毒的中國獲得榮耀。但又有一個說法，獲得金牌的是振奮人心的〈國旗歌〉，而非略顯沉悶的〈國歌〉。
無論是哪一曲，至今都退出它們的舞台。最先取消看電影前唱國歌慣例的縣市是宜蘭。一九八八年，陳定南擔任宜蘭縣長，廢止宜蘭縣電影院播放國歌，其他縣市紛紛跟進。我太久沒進戲院，不知它席捲全台，看電影不須再高唱，我也遺失〈國歌〉畫面中，自己曾佇立的兩個場景：一是金門太武山，蔣介石題字「毋忘在莒」，再就是介壽路，民眾搖旗吶喊參加國慶活動的集合地。
介壽路上，正對著「總統府」，國慶當天，由學生近萬名，戴上綠帽與紅帽，排列成「中華民國萬歲」等字樣。要不是高中時，就讀北市學校，被派與戴帽子排字樣的集體任務，我不會知道，字是這般排成的。往昔在電視上看到偌大的字樣，都好奇那是怎麼回事？是漆上的？是電視用後製技術，剪貼上去？原來那些字樣是動員學生上萬名，「站」出來的。
我們興奮地戴上「綠帽」，除了得以參加盛會，再是隔壁站著的，恰恰是台灣女子高校最高學府「北一女中」，更好運的是第二女子學府「中山女中」緊接在後。這兩所學校當然得特地加上下引號。我就讀南港高工重機械修護科，屬工業職業學校，它的目的在培育藍領階層，機械、車床等行業，非常符合七○年代台灣產業發展需要。操作機械等器具都會接觸髒汙油品，雙手時常黑黝，也被稱為「黑手」。高中時，青春萌動，聯誼時常有之，但絕對不敢「癩蝦蟆想吃天鵝肉」，邀約北一女、中山女中，甚至街上、車上碰到，都會自卑閃避，而今國慶時排字幕，雖離前呼後擁甚遠，但站在同一條路，且為數眾多，不免醺醺然。
沒有人告訴我們，讀書優劣只是成功的法門之一，我們被馴養為堅貞的勞工，吃苦當吃補，人人期許當社會小小的螺絲釘。而今，螺絲釘旁邊，花朵們亭亭玉立，一股激昂在介壽路上、在青天白日滿地紅的旗幟下，一一炸裂了。第一天排練，已有眼尖的同學瞄準清麗可人的女學生。第二天排練，同學已經備好情書，遲遲不敢遞交。最後一天了，閱兵台前，來自四面八方的花車整齊經過，我們站在紅傘、綠傘交錯的隊伍中，看不到壯觀行列，但透過氣氛、透過司儀字正腔圓且高亢、激昂的介紹，一顆心，跟著燃燒了。然青春吾輩，在傘海下，還燃燒著愛情的渴盼。
那一天國慶日，對寫好情書的同學來說，也像世界末日。錯過今天，再難遇見。我們發揮團隊戰力，讓同學脫了他的綠帽，舉高他的帽子，免得字幕有了瑕疵，適時把風，讓他潛逃到北一女陣地，給心儀的女孩一封情書。那不過在七、八列外，五、六公尺遠，我們看得清楚，女生怎麼地吃驚、抬高臉，當作甚麼都沒有看到。同學的背影定在一處，非常石頭、非常死寂，大約呆了三、五秒，默默退回陣地。我們當作甚麼都沒有看到，不再去問。
我直到而立之年，都還為「口吃」所苦，男女生談情說愛，少了一張能說的嘴，跟感情圈始終遙遠，何況是在懵懂的十七歲？我拍拍同學肩膀，也無法多說。示愛未果，同學很快力竭，慶祝活動長達三個多小時，學校教導我們累的時候，腳趾可以一屈一放，釋放壓力，但同學很快頂不住了，我們輪流幫他，舉高綠色的傘帽。
同學休息了一會，站起來，接過他的帽子，再不望向北一女陣地。倒是我偶爾偷瞄一下。綠上衣、黑裙子，素淨雅麗，雙眼水漾，脖子上有一點黑痣。散會了，同學情傷稍退，我們恢復同學本色，搜他身體，找那封情書，「親愛的北一女同學，很希望認識你，你的綠色衣，讓我想起向陽中，茵茵草尖的一點微露……」
原來情苗，能讓黑手，把他的烏黑都洗淨了。
我上班處與介壽路，不到百公尺，每回經過，都要回想一遍當年的情事。「介壽路」由來，是為了向蔣介石祝壽，一九九六年三月二十一日，陳水扁任台北市長時，介壽路更名為「凱達格蘭大道」，以命名正式掀起台灣本土風潮。
不管這路是甚麼路名，這路啊，依舊筆直，但它所經歷的曲折與故事，更勝一場電影了。
點潮汐當年有機會在「介壽路」戴綠帽、排「中華民國萬萬歲」的少年們，至少都四十開外了，吾輩則過半百，每逢經過排演的現場，往事歷歷在目。難怪稱作「心房」，想起從前，發現它依然慌張、羞羞地跳，它的隔間中，也住著好多人事物。久站疲憊，如何又能站得更久？我在日後許多場合，跟朋友分享文中所說的祕訣，腳板子伸、縮，即可降低疲勞。當意識到腳板運動時，一部分的注意力就不在疲憊上，這一招，遂有生理與心理的雙重內涵。是介壽路也好、是凱達格蘭大道也罷，在這條大道上有愛國行動、自力救濟，以及各種訴求的靜坐。活動過後，路又乾乾淨淨，帶著點無情、疏離，不干己事的模樣。其實，一切都發生了，生、老、病、死，以及榮耀與恥辱。

日子如潮、時間似汐，它們一丁點一丁點吃掉我，而我，一丁點一丁點吐回去，用我的文字記錄十七年——上樓、下樓，東向、西拐，都是我與重慶南路。

從1999到2016，看一個行人、作家、編輯人怎麼走過時間，漂流路上，直抵心岸的潮汐……

「吳鈞堯善雜談，他擁有一雙火眼金睛，常能窺破事理人情，點出幽微的內蘊。《重慶潮汐》體現了他做為全方位寫作者的能耐——唐捐 專文推波」

重慶南路　心岸潮汐日復一日的同一條路，他走過、生活過，彷彿一款青春，離開了仍不斷在夢中回望，最終成為永恆的鄉愁。
「重慶」指的是空間。從出自遠方的地名關聯，延伸到他近身的編輯檯，以重慶南路的幼獅公司為原點、半徑五百公尺的鄰近街道做書寫版圖：開封、漢口、武昌、沅陵街等，有新公園、城中市場、明星咖啡館、中山堂與總統府……座落其間。
「潮汐」說的是時間。路寬似海，來回往復。人流、車流，合力湧動著一股能量，轉動街景的變化：從猶是手工為主的九○年代、數位化衝擊的世紀初、以迄新媒體的當代，他看盡這條路的盛衰流變：老字型大小書店、台北相機街、沅陵皮鞋街、金石堂與現代詩、劉銘傳傳奇……亦同步喚起人生各階段的成長經驗，領會歲月的起伏積澱。　　
雖然十多年過去，我老了、疲憊了，但這一條街會是我的留戀，尤其當一條街，愈來愈像一條河的時候。
緣於職場因素，作者在重慶南路上盤桓十七年，街道如河流，儘管無法留痕，仍欲攬住逐漸消逝的文化風景，此書承載了深厚的時代印記，也演映著個人的心影錄。

本書特色


獲國家文化藝術基金會創作補助。
作者特意為重慶南路寫史，旁及閱讀產業盛衰流變與人生流動紀事，也觸及台灣歷史之變遷。
二十篇漫步重南街廓的城市書寫，呈現文化記錄與地誌文學的完美範式；四篇斐然風格之長文〈你也來了〉〈她在這裡〉〈漂流地址〉〈有人找我〉——筆透人生的虛實與輕重，這種散文最好看了！

Wu Hao, ""Chaoqing Chaoshan"": Love Letter on Jieshou Road
02 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is whether it is Jieshou Road or Ketagalan Avenue. There are patriotic actions, self-reliance and meditation on this avenue. After the event, the road was clean and ruthless, alienated, and not doing anything.

Love letter on Jieshou Road
I didn't realize that I was waiting.
I sat in the collapsed chair of the theater, my eyes narrow. The audience walked in, holding cola, snacks, and slowly seated. The lights in the theater are like the moonlight after the fog. There is a little dim and some drunkenness, as if it must create a dreamlike color, which is in line with the essence of the film: ""If it is true, it will be true."" I also have a ""small person's mind"". If the theater does not dim the lights, drink stains, old gum residue, etc., will be eye-catching. The lights smeared them all, like after a while, it used comedy, tragedy, etc., let us laugh and cry.
The light is dark, indicating that the movie is about to play. Cinemas often serve as political propaganda bases. In the 1960s, ""No urgency is allowed."" In the 1970s, ""Following the traffic lights"" was announced. In the 1980s, the birth policy was promoted - ""One is not too small, two are just right."" Then came the movie preview, and suddenly I played the subtitles of ""Beginning the film.""
I pushed the companion arm, the fox questioned, ""Is the national anthem?"" I used to wait for the ""national anthem"" to start for a movie. At that time, people who drank drinks and chewed snacks had to stand up quickly, waiting for the national anthem to sing, to be seated and enjoy a movie. I will tell my companion, ""Look at it, there are two attractions in the national anthem. I have been there."" My words show off and glory, as if I were part of history.
The ""national anthem"" of Taiwan is ""the song of the Chinese Kuomintang Party."" The first two sentences of it are ""Three People's Principles, and the Party's sects"", which caused the identification of political parties. During the New Year's Eve activities, Taipei, Kaohsiung and Taichung City did not have a multi-year event, but the New Year's Day flag-raising ceremony was held. After the 21st century, the New Year's Day was taken over the New Year, but the flag is still being processed. One year, in order to encourage the participation of the people, the popular Kuomintang sacrificed participants, donated cultural products such as flag scarves, and various media contested the public to queue up and collect gifts.
The media also promoted narrowly capturing politicians outside the Kuomintang. Will they sing the National Anthem? Many politicians shun the first two sentences of the national anthem. The first sentence of the ""National Song"" lyrics is ""Three People's Principles"", also known as the ""Three People's Songs."" The song has a vocabulary and then a song. The lyrics are also called ""Whampoa Military Academy Training Words"" or ""Ministerial Admonitions"". It is the preface of Sun Yat-sen's opening ceremony at the Whampoa Military Academy on June 16, 1924.
During the national hour, the teacher once said the anecdote of the National Anthem. The plot is the National Anthem to participate in an international competition, and defeated the countries to obtain a ""gold medal"" with a beautiful melody. In the 1970s, China and Taiwan’s national strength were weak, and the national anthem won the gold medal, which was inspired by national morale. However, it was discovered that it was true that the National Anthem was honored. It was not just a national confidence machine. In 1936, the Olympics were held in Germany. Hitler was convinced that the best people were Germans, and even the national anthem was no exception, and the national anthem was strongly inserted. After the announcement, it was the glory of China that was poisoned by the powers. But there is another saying that the gold medal is the exciting ""Flag of the Flag"", not the rather dull ""national anthem"".
No matter which song, it has so far withdrawn from their stage. The county and city that first canceled the practice of singing the national anthem before watching the movie was Yilan. In 1988, Chen Dingnan served as the county magistrate of Yilan, abolishing the Yilan County cinema to play the national anthem, and other counties and cities followed suit. I haven't entered the theater for a long time. I don't know if it swept the whole Taiwan. I don't have to sing to watch movies. I also lost two scenes in the National Anthem. I have stood in the scene: First, Jinmen Taiwu Mountain, Chiang Kai-shek inscription ""Ignore ""莒"", then Jieshou Road, the people screamed and shouted to participate in the National Day gathering place.
On the Jieshou Road, facing the ""Presidential Office"", on the National Day, nearly 10,000 students, wearing green hats and red hats, arranged in the words ""Long live the Republic of China"". If I was not in high school, I would like to go to the North City School and be assigned to the collective task of wearing a hat. I will not know that the words are arranged in this way. I used to see the big words on TV, and I was curious about what was going on? Is it painted? Is the TV post-production technology, cut and paste? The original words were to mobilize tens of thousands of students and ""sit out"".
We are excited to wear the ""green hat"". In addition to being able to participate in the grand event, and then standing next door, it is precisely the highest school in Taiwan’s women’s colleges, ""Northern Women"", and the second female school ""Zhongshan Women"" is better. Followed by. Of course, the two schools have to add the quotation marks. I attended the Nangang High-tech Heavy Mechanics Maintenance Department, an industrial vocational school. Its purpose is to cultivate blue-collar workers, machinery, lathes and other industries, which is in line with the needs of Taiwan's industrial development in the 1970s. Equipment such as operating machinery will be exposed to dirty oil, and both hands are often black, also known as ""black hands."" When I was in high school, my youth was sprouting, and there was always a friendship. But I absolutely didn’t dare to ""snake shrimps and want to eat swan meat."" I invited a girl from the north, a woman from Zhongshan, and even on the street and in the car, she would dodge inferiority, and now the National Day The subtitles, although far from the front, are on the same road, and there are many, it is inevitable.
No one told us that the pros and cons of reading is only one of the successful methods. We are domesticated as a strong laborer, and when we suffer, we should make up for it. Everyone is expected to be a small screw in society. Nowadays, next to the screws, the flowers are slim, and one of them is on the road of Jieshou, under the banner of the blue sky and the red, bursting one by one. On the first day of rehearsal, the students with sharp eyes were aiming at the beautiful female students. The second day of rehearsal, the students have prepared a love letter, and have been afraid to submit. On the last day, in front of the parade, the floats from all directions were neatly arranged. We stood in a parade of red umbrellas and green umbrellas. We could not see the spectacular ranks, but through the atmosphere, through the ceremonial words, we were full of enthusiasm and excitement. , a heart, followed by burning. However, my youth, under the umbrella, still burns the thirst for love.
On that day, National Day, for the students who wrote love letters, it is also like the end of the world. Missing today, it is hard to meet. We played the team's strength, let the classmates take off his green hat, raise his hat, lest the subtitles have a flaw, timely wind, let him flee to the North women's position, a love letter to the favorite girl. That's just outside the seven or eight columns, five or six meters away. We can see clearly how the girls were surprised and raised their faces and saw nothing. The back of the classmate was set in one place, very stone, very dead, about three or five seconds, silently returned to the position. We didn't see anything as we did, and we stopped asking.
I have been suffering from ""stuttering"" until the end of my life. The boys and girls talk about love and love, and they have a mouth that can be said, and they are always far away from the emotional circle, let alone the seventeen years old who are ignorant? I patted my classmate's shoulder and couldn't say more. The show was unsuccessful, and the classmates quickly exhausted. The celebration lasted for more than three hours. When the school taught us how tired we were, the toes could be released and released, but the students couldn’t stand it anymore. We took turns helping him and raising it. Green umbrella cap.
The classmate took a break, stood up, took his hat, and no longer wanted to go north to a female position. Instead, I occasionally sneaked on it. Green blouse, black skirt, plain and elegant, eyes wide, and a little black scorpion on the neck. After the meeting, the classmates recovered a little, and we resumed the classmates' true color, searched his body and found the love letter. ""Dear North girl, I hope to know you, your green clothes, reminds me of Xiangyang, Yinyin a little bit of a dew...""
The original seedlings can make the black hand wash his black.
I went to work and Jieshou Road, less than 100 meters, every time I passed, I have to think back to the situation of the year. The origin of ""Jie Shou Lu"" is to celebrate the birthday of Chiang Kai-shek. On March 21, 1996, when Chen Shui-bian was the mayor of Taipei, Jieshou Road was renamed ""Kai Da Glan Avenue"". The tide.
No matter what the road name is, this road is still straight, but the twists and turns it has experienced are more than a movie.
At that time, the tides of the youngsters who had the opportunity to wear a green hat at the ""Jie Shou Lu"" and the ""Longevity of the Republic of China"" were at least forty. The seniors were over half a hundred. Every time after the rehearsal, the past was vivid. No wonder it is called ""atrium"". When I think of it, I found that it is still panicking and shyly jumping. In its compartment, there are also many people living. How long can you stand still and how can you stand longer? On many occasions in the future, I share the secrets mentioned in the article with my friends, and the feet can be stretched and contracted to reduce fatigue. When I realize that the footboard is moving, part of the attention is not exhausted. This trick has both physical and psychological connotations. Whether it is Jieshou Road or Ketagalan Avenue, there are patriotic actions, self-reliance, and various meditations on this avenue. After the event, the road was clean and ruthless, alienated, and not doing anything. In fact, everything happened, life, old age, illness, death, and glory and shame.

The days are like the tide, the time is like a slap, they eat me bit by bit, and I, a little bit of spit back, use my words to record seventeen years - upstairs, downstairs, east, west, all I am with Chongqing South Road.

From 1999 to 2016, see how a pedestrian, writer, and editor walked through time, drifting on the road, reaching the tide of the heart...

Chongqing South Road The same road along the heart of the tide, he walked through, lived, as if a youth, left and still look back in the dream, and eventually become an eternal homesick.
""Chongqing"" refers to space. From the distant place name association, extended to his close editorial desk, writing the layout of the adjacent streets with the radius of 500 meters from the Cubs Company of Chongqing South Road: Kaifeng, Hankou, Wuchang, Fuling Street, etc. There are new parks, city markets, star cafes, Zhongshan Hall and the presidential palace... in the meantime.
""Tide"" is time. The road is wide like the sea and reciprocates back and forth. The flow of people, the flow of cars, and the force of a surge of energy, turning the changes of the street scene: from the early 1990s, the beginning of the digital impact, the modern era of the new media, he saw the rise and fall of this road Rheology: the old font size bookstore, Taipei Camera Street, Fuling Leather Shoes Street, Jinshitang and modern poetry, Liu Mingchuan legend... also simultaneously evoke the growth experience of all stages of life, and understand the ups and downs of the years.
Although more than ten years later, I am old and exhausted, but this street will be my nostalgia, especially when it is a street, more and more like a river.
Due to the factors of the workplace, the author has been in the Chongqing South Road for 17 years. The streets are like rivers. Although they can't keep marks, they still want to take advantage of the fading cultural landscape. This book bears a profound imprint of the times and also reflects the personal heart.
