Bournemouth 1-0 Man Utd: 5 talking points as Josh King fires Cherries to victory
The Red Devils slipped to defeat at the Vitality Stadium due to Josh King's first-half strike
02 Nov 2019, 14:21 by Darren Lewis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-lewis/
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer saw Manchester United ’s brief revival ended by Reds reject Joshua King.
The Bournemouth forward, 27, produced an outstanding goal on the stroke of half time - lifting the ball over Aaron Wan Bissaka before volleying past David de Gea.
The win sent Eddie Howe’s men above United in the Premier League table to pile the pressure back on to Solskjaer.
King spent four years with the Norwegian’s reserves at Old Trafford. But he appeared just once in United’s senior team, in the League Cup.
He left on a free for Blackburn in 2013 before joining Bournemouth for £1million four years ago.
United had arrived on the south coast on the back of their best run of form since Solskjaer was handed the manager’s job full time.
The Red Devils had been unbeaten in all competitions since returning from the international break. They followed a 1-1 draw against league leaders Liverpool with wins over Partizan Belgrade, Norwich and Chelsea to reach the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup.

United stopped in their tracks
Not quite back to Square One for Manchester United but a performance to illustrate the fact that, for all their good work in their previous three - consecutive - away wins, you still just cannot trust them.
Last Wednesday night’s win at Chelsea , to reach the Carabao Cup quarter-finals against the odds, was the best of their victories on their travels.
Their defensive discipline and superior desire suggested perhaps a turning point in a tough season for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
Yet here we are. Bournemouth would have scored more with better decision-making in the final third but still caused problems with their speed and creativity. United needed to take this chance to build on their good work.
Instead wins in their home games against Partizan and Brighton , followed by a trip to Sheffield United, cannot be taken for granted.

De Gea answers critics
He may have his critics but David de Gea did superbly well to at least give United a chance of salvaging something from this contest.
When Callum Wilson crossed in from the right with just over 20 minutes to go, Joshua King looked all set for the second goal from which Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side would surely not have recovered.
Instead, De Gea made himself big to deny the Norwegian, then saved again with his legs from Harry Wilson.
With 16 minutes to go the Spaniard saved again from the rising star on loan from Liverpool , diving to his left to keep out his fierce drive from the edge of the box.

Fred struggles again
It still defies belief that someone, somewhere at Old Trafford believed Fred was good enough to play for Manchester United .
Or that Shakhtar were able to keep a collective straight face for long enough to get the £47million deal done last year.
His lack of composure is such that nobody expected him to tuck away the two chances presented to him during the first half hour.
His lack of industry in midfield was such that he was outgunned by Jefferson Lerma. United will do well to get their money back.

King shows class
Josh King’s third goal of the season was his best yet. First the initial poise to make space for himself in a crowded penalty box.
Then the audacity to lift the ball over Aaron Wan-Bissaka - no slouch - then the composure to to volley the ball home past David de Gea.
A wonderful strike fully deserving of the TV audience it was granted. King has been accused in the past of being all speed and no finish but the Norwegian forward, 27, answered a few critics here with that effort.

A poor showing from Martial
Solskjaer raved about him in the pre-match build-up, insisting he was so much happier in the current set-up.
The statistics suggested results are so much better when the Frenchman starts. The expectation was that he’d turn up and turn it on. Clearly Bournemouth hadn’t had the memo.
When the Cherries defenders go through their pockets after this they’ll find him in there, nice and warm on this cold afternoon on the south coast. Martial’s impact on this game was minimal at best.
Nathan Ake and the evergreen Steve Cook must surely have feared a more difficult game. Instead they’ll be looking forward to Match of the Day.

What is known about Diablo IV
02 Nov 2019, 14:29 by Daniel Cortez
We collected all the details that are at the moment.



At BlizzCon 2019, Blizzard officially announced Diablo IV, the new part of the famous ARPG. The developers did not limit themselves to a beautiful story trailer: the gameplay trailers were shown to the audience and they continue to share details right at the exhibition.
We have collected everything that can be found about the game at the moment: from the features shown in the preview clips to the small details from the trial versions presented at BlizzCon 2019.
Plot



The events of the fourth part chronologically occur after Diablo III. The constant war of angels and demons finally exhausted the world of Sanctuary, the scene of Diablo: millions of people died, many old forces lost their influence, and the gates to Heaven were closed after Maltael’s attack in the Reaper of Souls - the angels again do not care about Sanctuary, which is why the world fell into decline.
Forests, swamps, mountains, steppes and abandoned cities are filled with monsters and undead. And, as if this were not enough, a new misfortune is brewing - the cult of Lilith, daughter of Mephisto.
Lilith is the new main antagonist of the series. According to the lore of the game, once upon a time she, together with the archangel Inarius, decided to get out of the eternal war of Hell and Heaven. Together with the followers, they created the Sanctuary and gave rise to the race of the Nephalems - half of the angels, half of the demons from whom people later descended.



The nefalems were far more powerful than the angels and demons. Because of this, the society of renegades from Hell and Paradise, who lived in Sanctuary under the leadership of Inarius and Lilith, began to fear a new race - it was decided to destroy the nephalems. Learning about what they want to do with her children, Lilith went crazy and killed all the apostates. For this, her husband Inarius expelled Lilith from Sanctuary to the Void.
This whole story is for the most part revealed in Diablo 3, but even before that, Lilith had already appeared in the series, namely in Diablo 2. It could only be seen in the official Blizzard worlds as part of a special event, the Pandemonium Event. According to its plot, Lilith is the queen of the succubus, revives the dead demons and builds her cunning plans in Sanctuary.
Gameplay Lilith is an enhanced version of Andariel, who, according to the original canon, was the queen of the succubus daughter (later the canon was rewritten to Diablo III). She borrowed a repainted black model from a relative. The same poisonous attacks and great physical damage, increased many times.



However, there is still debate in the game community about whether its appearance in Diablo II can be considered a canon - the Pandemonium Event conflicts with the third part lore.
Otherwise, almost nothing is known about the plot of the future game except Lilith and the cult returning her to Sanctuary. Of interest is perhaps the announcer from the gameplay video, which talks about the dark future of the world in front of a certain grave. Judging by the context of his words and appearance, he is either a member of the Horadrim Order or brother of Deckard Cain.



Characters
Five characters are announced on the release - the classic starter pack in the series since Diablo II. At the moment, three are known.
Barbarian is a melee fighter. In fact, the same thing that we saw in the previous parts: endurance, physical strength, battle cries and powerful jumps. In trailers, you can notice only one distinguishing feature called the Arsenal: the barbarian constantly changes weapons in battle, switching from twin axes to a two-handed sword and a mace. According to the statements of people who played for the hero at the exhibition, a barbarian can carry up to four sets of weapons.



Enchantress - a classic magician. She skillfully combines elements (ice, fire and lightning) and quickly moves around the location with the help of cunning spells. For example, a sorceress can become a ball of lightning and split the enemies through which she passes.



Druid is a summoner relying on the forces of nature. His gameplay style is reminiscent of the Greymane of Heroes of the Storm: some abilities make him turn into a beast. In the gameplay video and demo available on Blizzcon, he becomes a verovolph and a bear. Also, a druid can summon two wolves as assistants.



All characters can be fully customized - in particular gender, face, tattoo, earrings and skin color.
Leveling, talent tree and equipment
There will be no cardinal changes in the classical system of progression in the game - all the same, you have to cut out crowds of monsters for the sake of experience and gold. But the talents have changed: Diablo IV will return a full-fledged talent tree in the manner of Diablo II. The developers said they did not want to give players a choice between the builds they had previously prepared, but to give complete freedom to create their own tactics and characters - just like in the old parts.

However, Blizzard reports that the new system is more likely to take the best ideas from Diablo II and Diablo III and combine them together. So in the videos, you can notice that in the quick access panel the characters still have a skill on each mouse button (if playing from a PC) and four skills to choose from, as in the third part.
In addition, the game will return the runes and runic words from Diablo II - special inserts for equipment, which, when used correctly, can give weapons or armor unique properties. According to Blizzard, they will be slightly less powerful than in Diablo II.



On the release, developers promise hundreds of legendary items. There will also be unique sets of equipment, but in their power they will be inferior to those of Diablo III.
Sanctuary World
Diablo IV will be much darker than the third part: faded tones, gray scales, extreme cruelty and a sea of ​​blood. Civilization lies in ruins: the developers want to show the Sanctuary devastated by dozens of large-scale wars with demons, where there is almost no one left who can stop the next invasion.
The world of Diablo IV is divided into five large regions, not limited by the plot limits: you can explore and go through them freely. Locations have become larger and wider - you will have to move around them on horses, which, like characters, can be customized.



In addition, other players will constantly meet at locations - Diablo IV adopted the experience of Destiny and made a bias towards IMO. Exploring the area, you can stumble upon a random hero performing his tasks, and combine forces with him. Also, world bosses will be roaming around Sanctuary, which can be defeated only by the forces of a dozen people.



In addition to locations with monsters and procedurally generated dungeons in Diablo IV there will be hub cities where it is forbidden to fight and use spells. But there you can communicate with the NPC and exchange equipment with the players. By the way, Blizzard promise to return some semblance of an auction for the exchange of artifacts, but no real money will be needed to use it - the studio remembers the mistakes of Diablo III.
Also in the game from the start, full-fledged PvP will be available - you can fight with a friend outside the city walls without any problems. By the way, if you do not want to share your story in Sanctuary with other players, Diablo IV can be played in solo mode without any problems.



Small details and details

In the video, you can notice some semblance of parkour: a barbarian character scrambles up a cliff to fight another hero.
Diablo IV will be released on this generation of consoles.
Diablo IV has no release date yet: according to Blizzard, Diablo IV will not be released soon, even by the standards of the studio. It will take a long time to wait for the game. It is possible that over time, the studio will change its mind about support for PS4 and Xbox One - if the process drags on.
The game has room for further development through additions: the studio is set to seriously develop the fourth part after the release of content like new classes, locations and equipment.
The game will require a permanent network connection, even if you play alone.
Developers will conduct more closed and open beta tests compared to Diablo III to avoid repeating the story with the famous bug 37.
To create dungeons, the studio uses an improved algorithm for generating from the third part.
The game will have a cycle of day and night, as well as dynamic weather.
Health and mana indicators are now in one corner of the screen for convenience: there are no more balls with statues on the sides of the screen, as before.
The character selection menu will be made in the spirit of Diablo II: all the characters are sitting or standing around a fire in the middle of the wilderness.
The game will have dashes and evasions, and on all platforms: in Diablo III, such a gameplay opportunity is only on consoles. This will be useful against big bosses: in the gameplay video, you can notice that especially strong monsters can kill a hero with one blow.
