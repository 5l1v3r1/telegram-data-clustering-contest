      <h1>20 months after Ambode closed Olusosun dumpsite, Lagos govt. plans another closure - Premium Times Nigeria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T14:44:54+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 14:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/ssouth-west/360685-20-months-after-ambode-closed-olusosun-dumpsite-lagos-govt-plans-another-closure.html" target="_blank">Premium Times</a></address>
      <p>The Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) on Saturday said plans had been concluded to decommission its Olusosun and Solous landfill sites.</p>
      <p>The Managing Director of LAWMA, Muyiwa Gbadegesin, said in a statement that the decommissioning was due to urban encroachment and increased human activities around the areas.</p>
      <p>Mr Gbadegesin said the move became necessary as both sites drew close to the end of their lifespans.</p>
      <p>He said the process of winding down activities at those landfill sites had commenced.</p>
      <p>The government’s announcement comes barely two years after the previous administration shut down the dumpsite.</p>
      <p>In March last year, then governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, while visiting the dumpsite said <b><a href="https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/03/957502/">was shut because it had become hazardous to the residents and traders in the neighbourhood</a></b>.</p>
      <p>Mr Ambode’s decision came <b><a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/ssouth-west/261913-olusosun-dumpsite-has-been-a-source-of-concern-lagos-govt-resident.html">following an inferno that began from the dumpsite and destroyed several buses</a></b> belonging to the transport firm, LAGBUS.</p>
      <p>Months after the closure by Mr Ambode, activities resumed at the dumpsite.</p>
      <p>In the latest announcement of the closure of the dumpsite, Mr Gbadegesin reiterated most of what Mr Ambode had said – that there were not much human activities close to the sites at inception, but fast-paced development in the state has seen houses built around them.</p>
      <p>”The government is opening a new chapter in modern waste management for the state, through a number of comprehensive short and long-term strategies,” Mr Gbadegesin said.</p>
      <p>”The strategies include the reactivation of Kesse Landfill project at Badagry; construction of additional material recovery facilities and transfer loading stations around the metropolis.”</p>
      <p>The LAWMA boss said that government also planned to build community recycling centres in all the local governments and development areas of the state.</p>
      <p>Mr Gbadegesin said that immediate measures would be taken to mitigate the impact of the closure.</p>
      <p>He said the long-term objective of government was “a Lagos State where no landfill sites are required but only waste management facilities, waste to energy and incineration plants.”</p>
      <p>Mr Gbadegesin said that plans were on to establish 5MW waste to energy plants at Solous 3, Olusosun and Epe landfills, to tap the energy potential available there.</p>
      <p>He said that Olusosun would eventually be transformed into a waste treatment centre.</p>
      <p>Mr Gbadegesin reiterated the agency’s commitment to promoting waste recycling and best practice in waste management.</p>
      <p>He urged residents to embrace LAWMA’s Blue Box programme and the concept of waste sorting at source.</p>
      <p>The managing director charged members of the public on proper disposal of refuse, warning that there were sanctions for violation.</p>
