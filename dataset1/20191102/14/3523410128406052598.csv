According to the Bulletin News, the 6th annual ""Our Music Celebration"" will be held in Royal Hall in Tehran on December 2, 1977, with the slogan ""Empathy for Iranian Musicians."" The event will host renowned artists in various fields of music as well as a wide range of audiences of this popular art.
Selected works and artists of Iranian music will be released in 1977 based on a poll conducted these days at awards.musicema.com. The poll includes both expert and popular sections, and the popular vote count has exceeded 300,000 votes.
The poll was renewed until November 15, according to the polling staff's sixth annual ""Our Music"" poll. Polls in this year's polls were also in consultation with professors and music reformers to commemorate the more appropriate works in the celebration.
But the slogan of empathy for Iranian musicians has been chosen for this grand musical event that has brought together musicians of all ages and styles overnight over the past few years. Something that is unique in the field of music. This is the main point and purpose of our ""Annual Music Celebration"", which has always received much feedback from images and videos.
Our sixth celebration of music will be honored by pioneers of music in the years following their artistic life.
