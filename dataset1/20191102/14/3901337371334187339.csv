Earlier in the season, Bucs had conceded 12 times in the league after seven matches as they battled out of the top eight, and another goal came in during the MTN8 as they were knocked out of the competition in first round.
“The coach (Rhulani Mokwena) alluded to the fact that as our game model, as our team structure, we defend as a collective. So we’ve sat down as a group of players and we’ve discussed where our shortfalls are defensively as a collective not as any individuals and not as any departments but as a whole team – what we can do better. So I think going forward…you can see, you know, maybe we are sort of defending a little bit more solidly and that’s just due to the whole collective outlook of the team and everybody being on the same page,” Sandilands told the Siya crew, about the improvement.
