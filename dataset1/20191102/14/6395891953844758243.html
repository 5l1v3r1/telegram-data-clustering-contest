      <p>Zach Robbins, 42, and his wife, Jie Robbins, 47, were arrested at their Gilbert home Friday, <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/region-southeast-valley/gilbert/pd-gilbert-couple-arrested-charged-with-trafficking-2-7-million-in-stolen-property">KNXV</a> reported. They were charged with trafficking stolen property, money laundering and illegal control of an enterprise, according to the Gilbert Police Department. </p>
      <p>During a search Friday at the couple's home, police said they recovered $500,000 and $750,000 worth of stolen, over-the-counter health and beauty products, the <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/gilbert-breaking/2019/11/01/gilbert-couple-suspected-selling-stolen-health-and-beauty-products/4129724002/">Arizona Republic</a> reported.</p>
      <p>According to police, the Robbinses paid others to shoplift items from local stores, and the couple would resell the merchandise through Amazon and eBay storefronts, the newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>Gilbert police officials said the couple had been operating "interstate sales of stolen property" for more than four years, collecting approximately $2.7 million from online sales, the <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/gilbert-breaking/2019/11/01/gilbert-couple-suspected-selling-stolen-health-and-beauty-products/4129724002/">Republic</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Police were alerted to the sales about three months ago, <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/region-southeast-valley/gilbert/pd-gilbert-couple-arrested-charged-with-trafficking-2-7-million-in-stolen-property">KNXV</a> reported. No other arrests have been made in the case, according to the <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/gilbert-breaking/2019/11/01/gilbert-couple-suspected-selling-stolen-health-and-beauty-products/4129724002/">Republic</a>.</p>
