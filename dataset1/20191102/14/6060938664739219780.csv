Akshay Kumar’s ‘Laxmmi Bomb’ set to clash with Salman Khan’s ‘Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai’ on Eid 2020

Come Eid 2020, it is going to be a clash of the titans as Akshay Kumar is set to take on Salman Khan at the box office.
The makers officially announced that the release of ‘Laxmmi Bomb’ has been advanced and will now hit screens on Eid, 2020, a date Salman picked for the release of 'Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai'.
“EID 2020 ko, saare desh mein machega shor, jab fatega #LaxmmiBomb aapke nazdeeki cinema gharon mein,” read a tweet from the film’s official handle.
The makers even shared a poster of sorts that featured Akshay’s first look along with the release date in bold at the bottom.



'Laxmmi Bomb' which is a Hindi remake of the 2011 Tamil film 'Muni 2: Kanchana’, will also feature Kiara Advani in a leading role.
On the festive occasion of Navratri, the actor shared his first look from the film that saw him with a fierce look on his face, dressed in a cotton pink saree. The fact that the Khiladi of Bollywood is portraying such character onscreen for the first time has already got his fans excited.
Interestingly, Akshay had initially booked Eid 2020 for the release of his film 'Sooryavanshi', but advanced the release to avoid a clash with Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Inshallah' starring Salman Khan and Alia Bhatt. However, as the film was shelved, Salman surprised fans that he would release his next cop-drama 'Radhe: Your Most Wanter Bhai'.



2020 may just be Akshay’s year as he has three festive releases beginning with ‘Laxmmi Bomb’ on Eid, ‘Prithviraj’ on Diwali and ‘Bachchan Pandey’ on Christmas.
