Aston Villa legend Paul McGrath is backing his former club to end Liverpool’s long unbeaten run this afternoon.
The Reds head to Villa Park with nine wins from their opening 10 Premier League games and six points ahead of nearest challengers Manchester City.
Villa, on the back of a 3-0 loss away to the Citizens in their last League outing, are going in search of a third win from four top-flight games.
 
And McGrath, who played for Villa between 1989 and 1996, believes his old side can follow up Wednesday’s Carabao Cup victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers by beating the European champions.
He tweeted ahead of the game: “Aston Villa Fc v Liverpool Fc. Great test to see how good Liverpool are.
“Coming up against a brilliant defence, smashing midfield, and goal getters. Aston Villa win. #Relax#Enjoy#Result #UTV.”
McGrath's prediction will also please fans of his former club, Manchester United, another place where he is still deemed a legend.
