《運動百憂解》：不給予運動應有的重視，遇到生命難關就會嘗到最大苦果
02 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是透過運動來提升心靈健康，最美好的優點之一在於沒有副作用。尤其每天花十分鐘走路，就能身心同時獲益，且立即提升睡眠品質、精力和耐力。而最大的挑戰，往往是克服一開始心態上的重重障礙。



文：蜜雪．史丹克鮑加德（Michelle Steinke-Baumgard）
線性、三維？文化的問題
由於社會長期來不強調「動」的重要，使我們從很小開始，就養成久坐不動的生活方式和制約。特別是現在我有了孩子，看到大人努力教導孩子知識技能，像是數學算式、歷史上的重要日子和文學巨作等，而這些全都是要他們在學校盡可能一動也不動的坐著，真是令人沮喪。我把這種現象視為填鴨式教育的問題，換言之，我們花很多年來建立孩子腦袋裡的東西，卻忽視了他們的身體，以及其他關鍵的發展因子，例如重要的三維學習，這就好像我們把孩子的腦和小小的身體分開，因為我們不知為何認為兩者是互斥的。
這是個可怕的錯誤，因為身體和腦是共同而非分別運作，動動身子反而更能增進學習。更大的問題在於：父母不重視「運動」對孩子的重要性，孩子也就養成了「不動」的習慣而長大成人，於是全國的人都不給予運動應有的重視，一旦生命遇到難關，就會嘗到最大苦果。
反過來說，無論孩子或大人，如果在一天當中可以適時動動身子，就能提高專注力，思慮也會更清晰，因此許多大企業會實施員工的健康計劃，也會在辦公室設置健身鍛鍊中心。全世界幾家生產力數一數二的幸福企業，如Virgin Atlantic、Google、Mindvalley等，大多採身心靈整體健康的作法，不僅納入健身鍛鍊，也透過冥想靜坐來練習正念。拉提在著作《火花》中詳細探討：「我們一定要使腦袋和身體重新連結，不光為了提高學習力，也為了創造更快樂、更有能量且在各方面更有生產力的人類。」
運動、情緒與疾病
從科學了解了運動跟大腦和身體的關聯性，就可以進一步把缺乏運動與哀傷中的人經常會產生的抑鬱、焦慮和創傷後症候群等加以連結。
根據世界衛生組織，全世界至少有三億人受抑鬱困擾，抑鬱也是失能的首要因素。疾病管制和預防中心（Centers of Disease Controland Prevention）表示，美國是受抑鬱影響最深的前幾國，這些令人咂舌的數據，不僅使許多人無法擁有快樂與圓滿的人生， 林恩・戈柏格（Linn Goldberg） 在其著作《運動的療癒力》（The Healing Power of Exercise）中寫道：「抑鬱的治療成本、抑鬱造成的失能和損失的生產力，相當於花在心臟病上的錢。」抑鬱不只對個人、家庭，也對社會造成嚴重的損害，亟需一些方法，來對抗這個逐漸擴散的傳染病。
抑鬱比起沮喪或心情低落好幾天要嚴重許多，會製造伴隨而來的負面情緒，這種情緒大多時間會跟隨你，導致你對生活失去所有的興趣和樂趣，抑鬱往往連帶使人思路混亂或失眠，有時會興起自殺的念頭並產生高度罪惡感。
抑鬱是什麼造成的？如何避免成為身在哀傷中，且出現抑鬱症狀的人？根據《哈佛健康》（Harvard Health）指出，抑鬱的成因比大多數人所知道的更加複雜，常見的說法是：「抑鬱來自人體化學物質的失衡，但無法說明這種疾病有多複雜。
研究人員表示，抑鬱並不光是因為腦部某些化學物質過多或過少，相反地，抑鬱的可能因素很多，包括腦部的情緒調節出錯、基因缺陷、生活中的高壓事件、服用藥物以及醫療問題。」
儘管還無法確知抑鬱傾向是由何造成，但我們已經想出一些方法，來處理抑鬱的負面影響。根據《今日心理學》（Psychology Today）報導，超過二十五個案例的研究，確認運動有助於預防抑鬱：「多倫多大學的教授整理分析超過二十六年來的科學研究，發現即使是最溫和的身體活動，如每天走路二、三十分鐘，都可以防止各年齡層的人發生抑鬱。多倫多大學的博士候選人喬治・瑪曼（George Mammen）根據二十五份不同的研究報告共同撰寫評論，顯示長期從事溫和的運動，能預防抑鬱的短期發作，研究的整理發表在《美國預防醫學期刊》（American Journal of Preventive Medicine）十月號。」
焦慮和創傷症候群
許多人都知道焦慮的感覺：心臟彷彿要跳出來、呼吸不過來、暈眩、手抖或腿抖、有時會極度恐慌。《韋伯字典》（Merriam-Webster）形容焦慮是「害怕可能發生的事或感到緊張」，以及「不正常和無法承受的憂慮和恐懼感，通常會出現身體的信號（例如心情緊繃、盜汗和脈搏數增加），懷疑威脅的真實性和本質，以及懷疑自己應付威脅的能力。」
在許多情況下，哀傷和焦慮是哥倆好，當你經歷創傷，身體會用不同以往的方式來應付當前的處境，如果焦慮發生之初能更敏銳的辨識出來，就能及早開始透過運動、冥想、充足的營養和深呼吸等有效方法來克服焦慮。
根據梅約診所的說法：「後創傷壓力失調，是親身經歷或親眼目睹恐怖的事件，因而引起的心理病症，症狀包括腦中一再浮現事發經過、做惡夢、嚴重焦慮及不自主想到事件。」我在先夫墜機後不久，第一次察覺自己可能罹患後創傷壓力失調，因為當驚嚇逐漸退去，我卻開始對身邊的至親是否安在產生焦慮，當我沒有接到某人的回電或回覆的簡訊時，就會開始不安，看新聞時也會焦慮。後來，我做了一些生活上的調整，持續規律運動，並且盡量不靠藥物控制焦慮。
在經歷落失約兩年後，我開車在高速公路上，那條公路，正是先夫墜機當天我遇到塞車而動彈不得的公路。我看見對向車道發生嚴重車禍，當下身體好像四分五裂，我開始盜汗，嚴重焦慮到呼吸不過來。第二年又發生幾次類似的經驗，使我決定請教醫生和諮商師，他們確認我可能罹患輕微的PTSD。
我還記得聽見PTSD時，覺得自己的狀況很糟糕，然而我再度了解，健身鍛鍊在幫助調整焦慮和PTSD症狀方面可能有極大的幫助，根據馬修・杜爾（Matthew Tull）博士的說法：「有幾項針對規律運動對PTSD症狀的效果研究，其中一項對罹患PTSD的成年人所做的研究發現，每週三次、每次四十分鐘的有氧運動八週後，能減輕PTSD的自覺症狀、焦慮和抑鬱。另一份研究也是針對罹患PTSD的成年人，也發現在從事十二次有氧運動後，PTSD的症狀、抑鬱和焦慮也減輕了。」
   •  尋求協助解決抑鬱我要再三強調，如果你正陷入和抑鬱相關的任何情緒，一定要尋求醫師協助，這點非常重要。許多類似的情緒屬於哀悼傷痛過程的一部分，你或許不是臨床上的抑鬱，但這要由你的醫生和你一同釐清。醫學確實認為運動能有效治療輕微到中度的抑鬱，請你也和醫師討論，把健身鍛鍊納入療程中，由他們來建議最佳的治療方法。   •  改善睡眠和思慮的清晰度哀傷經常伴隨的「腦霧」症狀可能會相當棘手，人會出現注意力不集中、失神、健忘等思緒不清的情況。為了消除腦霧，務必好好睡覺，許多好的轉變會在睡覺的時候發生在腦部和身體上，血壓驟降，白天累積的心靈垃圾得以被清除，身體也會產生重要的生長激素。然而當你經歷人生巨變時，可能會變得輾轉難眠，這時可以藉由什麼來獲取所需的睡眠呢？答對了，就是「運動」！紮實的訓練計劃除了消耗精力，規律運動會使體溫上升，運動後體溫下降，兩者都有助之後的睡眠。常運動的人會發現失眠改善，這要歸功於焦慮和抑鬱症狀減輕了。運動加上良好的睡眠品質，就能更有效的克服哀傷。
運動救命
我在經歷刻骨銘心的落失後，才見識到健身鍛鍊的真正威力。我在無意間闖進了這個救命的療法，在經歷落失後，沒有人叫我去鍛鍊身體，事實上，許多人甚至無法相信我竟然花時間跑步，或者花一小時在健身房，當他們認為我應該哭倒在地的時候，我竟然專注在無關緊要且虛榮的事情上。
然而他們不知道的是，在健身房的一小時，對我整個生命和哀傷的控管有多重要，他們也不知道，唯有盡情流汗，才得以讓我度過落失的最初那幾個月。我很快就明白運動的重要，每做完一次運動，就愈發了解我必須窮盡餘生，來確保每位身在哀傷中的人也明白運動的重要性。
透過運動來提升心靈健康，最美好的優點之一在於沒有副作用。尤其每天花十分鐘走路，就能身心同時獲益，且立即提升睡眠品質、精力和耐力。而最大的挑戰，往往是克服一開始心態上的重重障礙。
你已經知道了各種數據和事實，下一章我將介紹「十二週運動療癒練習」的兩大要素：「運動」和「營養」。請務必了解基本概念，之後才下場子去跑。

""Sports Prozac"": Don't give the sports the attention you deserve, and you will taste the most bitter fruit when you encounter difficulties in life.
02 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is to improve your mental health through exercise. One of the best things is that there are no side effects. In particular, taking 10 minutes a day to walk, you can benefit both physically and mentally, and immediately improve sleep quality, energy and endurance. The biggest challenge is often to overcome the obstacles in the initial mentality.

Linear, three-dimensional? Cultural problem
Since the society has not emphasized the importance of ""moving"" for a long time, we have developed a sedentary lifestyle and constraints from a very young age. Especially now that I have children, I see adults trying to teach their children the knowledge and skills, such as mathematical calculations, important historical days and literary masterpieces, all of which are required to sit in the school as much as possible. It’s really frustrating. I see this phenomenon as a problem of cramming education. In other words, we have spent many years building things in our children's heads, but they have neglected their bodies and other key development factors, such as important three-dimensional learning, which is like us. Separate the child's brain from the small body because we don't know why they think the two are mutually exclusive.
This is a terrible mistake, because the body and the brain work together rather than separately, and moving the body is more effective in learning. The bigger problem is that parents don't pay attention to the importance of ""sports"" to their children. Children also develop the habit of ""not moving"" and grow up. Therefore, people all over the country do not give the sports the attention they deserve. , will taste the most bitter fruit.
Conversely, whether you are a child or an adult, if you can move your body in a timely manner during the day, you can improve your concentration and your thinking will be clearer. Therefore, many large companies will implement employee health plans and set up fitness centers in the office. . Many of the world's most profitable companies, such as Virgin Atlantic, Google, Mindvalley, etc., mostly adopt the practice of mental health as a whole, not only incorporating fitness exercises, but also practicing mindfulness through meditation. Lati explores in detail in the book ""Sparks"": ""We must reconnect our brains and bodies, not only to improve learning, but also to create happier, more energetic and more productive human beings.""
Exercise, mood and disease
From the scientific understanding of the relationship between exercise and the brain and the body, we can further link depression, anxiety and post-traumatic syndromes that are often caused by people who lack exercise and grief.
According to the World Health Organization, at least 300 million people worldwide suffer from depression, and depression is also the primary cause of disability. According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, the United States is the country most affected by depression. These astounding data not only make many people unable to have a happy and fulfilling life, Lynn Gober In his book The Healing Power of Exercise, Linn Goldberg writes: ""The cost of treatment for depression, the disability caused by depression, and the loss of productivity are equivalent to those that are spent on heart disease. Money."" Depression does not only cause serious damage to individuals, families, but also society. It needs some methods to fight this gradually spreading infectious disease.
Depression is much more serious than depression or depression for a few days. It will create negative emotions that accompany you. Most of the time will follow you, causing you to lose all interest and fun in life. Depression often leads to confusion. Or insomnia, sometimes raising the idea of suicide and producing a high degree of guilt.
What is depression caused? How to avoid being a person who is in grief and has depressive symptoms? According to Harvard Health, the cause of depression is more complex than most people know. The common saying is: ""Depression comes from the imbalance of human chemicals, but it does not explain how complicated the disease is.
The researchers said that depression is not just because there are too many or too few chemicals in the brain. On the contrary, there are many possible factors for depression, including brain regulation errors, genetic defects, high-pressure events in life, taking drugs, and medical problems. . ""
Although it is not yet known what causes depression, but we have come up with ways to deal with the negative effects of depression. According to Psychology Today, more than twenty-five cases of research confirm that exercise helps prevent depression: ""The University of Toronto professors have analyzed scientific research for more than twenty-six years and found that even the mildest Physical activity, such as walking for twenty or thirty minutes a day, can prevent depression in all ages. George Mammen, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Toronto, writes reviews based on twenty-five different research reports. It shows that long-term moderate exercise can prevent short-term episodes of depression. The research is published in the October issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.
Anxiety and trauma syndrome
Many people know the feeling of anxiety: the heart seems to jump out, breathe, stun, shake hands or legs, and sometimes panic. ""Merriam-Webster"" describes anxiety as ""a fear of what may happen or feels nervous"" and ""unusual and unbearable anxiety and fear, usually with signs of the body (such as a tight mood, night sweats and Increased pulse rate), doubting the authenticity and nature of the threat, and the ability to suspect that it is coping with the threat.""
In many cases, grief and anxiety are good for the two brothers. When you experience trauma, the body will cope with the current situation in different ways. If the anxiety is more acutely recognized at the beginning, you can start moving through the exercise, Effective methods such as meditation, adequate nutrition and deep breathing to overcome anxiety.
According to the Mayo Clinic: ""After post-traumatic stress disorder, it is a personal experience or witnessing a horrible incident. The psychological symptoms caused by the symptoms include the repeated occurrence of incidents in the brain, nightmares, serious anxiety and involuntary thoughts. Shortly after the first flight, I first noticed that I might suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, because when the frightened gradually receded, I began to worry about whether my close relatives were safe, when I did not receive someone’s When you call back or reply to a newsletter, you will start to feel uneasy and you will be anxious when you read the news. Later, I made some adjustments in my life, continued regular exercise, and tried to control anxiety without relying on drugs.
After about two years of experience, I drove on the highway. That road was the road where the first flight crashed on the day of the flight. I saw a serious car accident in the opposite lane. The current body seemed to be torn apart. I started to sweat, and I was so anxious that I couldn’t breathe. A few similar experiences occurred in the second year, which led me to consult doctors and counselors who confirmed that I might have a mild PTSD.
I still remember that when I heard PTSD, I felt that my condition was very bad, but I once again learned that fitness exercise may be of great help in helping to adjust anxiety and PTSD symptoms, according to Dr. Matthew Tull: There are several studies on the effects of regular exercise on PTSD symptoms. One study of adults with PTSD found that consciously reducing PTSD after eight weeks of aquabic exercise three times a week for 40 minutes. Symptoms, Anxiety, and Depression. Another study was also conducted for adults with PTSD. It was also found that after 12 aerobic exercises, the symptoms, depression, and anxiety of PTSD were also reduced.""
• Seeking help in solving depression I have to stress again and again that if you are caught in any mood related to depression, it is important to seek medical assistance. Many similar emotions are part of the mourning pain process. You may not be clinically depressed, but it is up to you to clarify with your doctor. Medicine does believe that exercise can effectively treat mild to moderate depression. Please discuss with your doctor and include exercise in your treatment to recommend the best treatment. • Improve the clarity of sleep and thinking. The “brain” symptoms that accompany the grief may be quite tricky, and people may have unclear thoughts such as inattention, loss of consciousness, and forgetfulness. In order to eliminate the brain fog, be sure to sleep well. Many good changes will occur in the brain and body during sleep. The blood pressure will drop suddenly. The accumulated mental waste during the day will be cleared, and the body will also produce important growth hormone. However, when you experience great changes in your life, you may become sleepy. What can you do to get the sleep you need? Correct, it is ""sports""! A solid training program, in addition to consuming energy, regular exercise will increase body temperature, body temperature after exercise, both of which will help after sleep. People who exercise regularly will find an improvement in insomnia, thanks to the relief of anxiety and depression. Exercise and good sleep quality can overcome grief more effectively.
Sports life
After I experienced the unforgettable loss, I realized the true power of fitness exercise. I accidentally broke into this life-saving therapy. After the loss, no one told me to exercise. In fact, many people can't even believe that I actually spend time running, or spend an hour in the gym when they think When I should cry to the ground, I was focused on things that were irrelevant and vain.
What they don't know, however, is how important it is to control my entire life and grief in the gym for an hour. They don't know. Only by sweating, I was able to let me through the first few lost. month. I quickly understood the importance of exercise. Every time I finished a sport, I became more aware that I had to spend the rest of my life to ensure that everyone in grief understands the importance of exercise.
One of the best things about improving mental health through exercise is that there are no side effects. In particular, taking 10 minutes a day to walk, you can benefit both physically and mentally, and immediately improve sleep quality, energy and endurance. The biggest challenge is often to overcome the obstacles in the initial mentality.
You already know the various data and facts. In the next chapter, I will introduce the two elements of the ""Twelve Weeks Exercise Healing Practice"": ""Sports"" and ""Nutrition."" Be sure to understand the basic concepts before you go to the next race.
