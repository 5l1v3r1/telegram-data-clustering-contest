NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg refused to meet with Ukrainian sailors in Odessa, who were detained in the Kerch Strait.
As stated by sources of the publication “Mirror of the Week,” the alliance abandoned the idea of holding a meeting between the head of the military bloc and the sailors.
It is alleged that the main opponent of the organization of the meeting were representatives of France. Paris spoke out against the idea, since such a meeting between the head of NATO and the sailors could ""disrupt the peace process and adversely affect the organization of negotiations in the"" Norman format "","" Strana.ua ""reports.
The head of NATO Stoltenberg paid a visit to Kiev in late October. He met with President Zelensky, and also spoke in the Verkhovna Rada.
On November 25, 2018, three ships of the Ukrainian Navy carried out a provocation in the Kerch Strait, invading the territorial waters of the Russian Federation and heading through the Kerch Strait. The border service of Russia and the FSB had to detain Ukrainian ships and almost 30 sailors.
