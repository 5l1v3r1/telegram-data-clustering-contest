《我們在德國IB學校學會的事》：別認為孩子的世界都充滿粉紅泡泡 
02 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是從這件事之後，我再也不敢輕忽任何一個「訊號」，也不再天真認為「孩子就是孩子」。面對青春期孩子，別總覺得「都是賀爾蒙作祟」而忽視，更別只是責罵和限制他們的失序行為。



文：凱若（Carol Chen）
他當然不只是個孩子，上警局作筆錄
現代的父母親無不重視教養與教育，費盡心思想給孩子鋪一條康莊大道，然而我們也該以同樣的用心和投入，了解兒女是否具備了足夠的心理素質，來面對人生諸多的挑戰。因為這世界不只是校園，影響孩子未來的，不只是成績表現而已。
某天晚上即將要入睡，女兒突然神情嚴肅的對我們說：「我有重要的事情要跟你們講。」她難得如此，我們當然豎直背脊、洗耳恭聽。
「我認為我的同學Ｍ可能想掃射學校。」
這位同學Ｍ曾來過我們家，我與他見過一次面，看起來不像是個不開心的孩子，我聽了很震驚，要女兒解釋究竟是怎麼一回事。原來，今天他們在餐廳裡輪流用短短一秒鐘對著手機鏡頭錄影，最後錄到Ｍ時，他大聲對著所有人說「I am school shooter!（我是校園掃射者！）」他看起來像是在開玩笑，所以其他同學不以為意，然而女兒與她的好姐妹並不這麼認為。
Ｍ最近家裡發生了一些事，心情常常陷入憂鬱。這還是因為他和女兒時常聊天，她才知道這些他沒有向其他同學透露的私事。而且女兒也知道Ｍ對於武器兵器非常熱衷，也看過他家某些「收藏品」，知道他的父親有時會買這類的「玩具」給他。女兒不確定自己看到的東西是真有殺傷力，還是只是擺設，但她也曾經聽過Ｍ邀請其他同學去買槍來玩，究竟嚴重程度到哪，沒人知道。
是認真的？還是開玩笑？
女兒的描述讓我們非常緊張，因為誰也不知道究竟這是「開玩笑」，還是他真的有這樣的意圖。我們更不清楚他接觸到的究竟是真正的槍枝，還是只是玩具。女兒曾看過他在社群媒體上分享的「收藏品」不只槍枝，還包括刀械，的確有可能傷害到自己或他人。討論過後，我們兩對家長立刻在深夜各寫了封E-mail給校長，並且講好了隔天一早立刻打電話到學校，確認校長會如何處理這件事。整夜我幾乎不能成眠。腦中不斷輪播之前在新聞中看到的美國高中槍擊案件，想著Ｍ知道我們家在哪，還曾經追過女兒，我心就非常不安定，槍擊案的照片影片更是在我腦海中揮之不去。
隔天才七點多，校長就已經回信給我們。他們就之前輔導Ｍ的經驗，決定讓警方介入，後續我們的孩子可能需要配合警方的調查，校長希望我們理解校方的決定。才收到信，我們兩邊家長就收到女兒們傳來的訊息，學校門口停了四部警車，警方進入校園與校舍搜索，當然也包括Ｍ的置物櫃，以及所有教室與學生使用的空間，要確認是否有危險物品存在。看到這麼多荷槍實彈的警察將整個校園翻過來檢查，的確嚇到了許多學生，甚至有些孩子哭了起來，說著「我不想死」。女兒努力保持鎮定，安慰其他同學這只是預防性的動作，但其實她自己都怕得要命！
校長在幾個鐘頭後，發了一封正式信件給所有家長，幸好警方並沒有找到任何危險物品，Ｍ也暫時不會回學校，會待在家中由家長完全監護，請我們放心。校長也私下再次與我通話，除了口頭報告校方處理的進度之外，他特別認真的說，請我務必要好好讚許女兒的勇敢。
這個「告發」的動作，對於校園的安全非常重要，然而卻不是所有學生都願意這麼做。因為對於青少年來說，同儕的認可非常重要，沒有人想當那個「告密者」，而更多時候他們認為這只是個惡作劇、玩笑話，笑笑就過去，不用太介意。校長已經親自對我家女兒表達了他的感謝與讚許，但還是特別希望我用母親的角色，再次鼓勵她。因為校方雖然沒有公布是哪位同學告發的，但他仍舊會擔心女兒接下來要面對被當成「告密者」的壓力，甚至因此覺得自己做錯了事。我感謝學校直接開放，也慶幸自己平日和孩子能夠暢言溝通，讓女兒能在感覺不對的時候，願意勇敢對我們說出來。
校長說的沒錯，這年紀的孩子要面對的，實在比我們能想像的多太多了！ 我們可能會覺得這是對的事，當然要做，但孩子的世界並不是你我想的那麼簡單。無論是父母親關係的緊張、課業的壓力、感情世界，甚至被霸凌、課堂上受挫，都有可能讓這個年紀的孩子認為「世界末日來了」而做出讓人難過的事。受欺負的孩子，常被大人用一句「你不要想那麼多」或「你不要理他們就好了」搪塞過去，然而這些話語無法解決青少年每天所要面對的困境。成人能否同理他們的壓力？ 還是我們總認為「他們只是孩子」，而忽略了他們在家中或學校裡所承受的各種挑戰？
別認為孩子的世界都充滿粉紅泡泡
對Ｍ同學來說，家中的低氣壓，加上在學校被排擠，都讓他隨時處在憂鬱和憤怒之中，這些都是早該受到關注的需要；對於女兒來說，公告好朋友的祕密，以及後續讓同學們受到牽連，也是極大的挑戰。我很感謝校長那通電話的提醒，讓我在接下來的幾週，甚至數月中，都特別關注女兒的心情和反應。幸運的是，所有的同學都支持她的決定，並沒有給她太多壓力，然而她有時仍對Ｍ所造成的心理恐懼不知所措，直到確定Ｍ要轉學，並且搬離我們的城市，她才漸漸放心，回到平日的歡笑。
說不定你看到這裡，會覺得「有什麼好大驚小怪的？ 哪個男孩不愛玩刀槍呢？」「孩子開玩笑說說，何必當真？」但後來警方的發現可能會讓各位與我一樣，大吃一驚，並且再也不敢輕忽。

這本書絕對不是IB學制的「推廣書」，而單純是一個母親與一個孩子在IB學校生活的點滴紀錄。當中我寫下了身為母親，在孩子受教育過程中面對的價值觀衝突、擔憂，與反思，也記錄下女兒「轉大人」這些年所經歷的故事，以及對她的長遠影響。——凱若Carol Chen
孩子努力的目標，就是發展成為最佳版本的「自己」！
108課綱正式上路，很多家長都在問：「素養是什麼？去哪裡補？」「評量卷哪裡買？」「學習歷程是什麼？怎麼下載？」
且慢！素養＝知識＋能力＋態度，不是靠補習、寫評量就可以養成的；學習歷程無法下載，而是要「每學期逐步上傳」。世界變化越來越快，傳統的學習方式已經追不上了，各國的教育系統如火如荼的改革中，為的就是培育能夠真正面對未來挑戰的人才，然而最根本也最關鍵的，卻是家長無誤。父母放下迷思，孩子才有機會！

旅居歐洲的作家凱若因為有跨國搬家的計劃，為小學畢業、剛從台灣搬到德國生活的女兒選擇了以英語為主、德語為輔的IB國際文憑課程（International Baccalaureate），原本看中的只是IB系統通行世界一百五十個國家，不管搬到哪裡都能順利銜接的優點。沒想到這個誤打誤撞的決定，竟改變了原本宣示「不想升學」的女兒。

四年來，陪伴女兒在德國求學，凱若體認到了——在強推孩子進入「學歷軍備競賽」，或苦口婆心勸他們讀書升學之前，身為父母，我們得先思考清楚「學歷」二字的意義。很快的將來，二十多歲時拿到的文憑和證照，只能幫助我們找到第一份工作，後續就得靠自己不斷為自己升級，才能維持競爭力。
而她現年十五歲的女兒在德國IB學校學到了：了解知識的樂趣和意義，主動投入學習有系統的學習收集與分析資訊，產出自己的論點循序漸進內化邏輯推理和口語表達的能力時常思考「如何應用所學來解決問題」探索自我，找到人生的志向：運動管理
這些都是孩子面對未來挑戰時需要具備的能力，凱若家的經驗，值得每一個關心孩子教育的家長參考。

IB是什麼?

International Baccalaureate國際文憑課程，簡稱IB。它是一種獨立於各國教育體制之外的學制，其課程制定與教學方法，有別於各國的義務教育。現在全世界超過一百五十個國家都設有IB學校，提供3-19歲的學生相當於小學→中學→高中的課程，強調國際化與全人教育，重視均衡發展，鼓勵學生探索自我、獨立思考。

""What we learned at the IB School in Germany"": Don't think that the world of children is full of pink bubbles.
02 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is that after this incident, I will never dare to ignore any ""signal"" and no longer think that ""the child is a child."" In the face of adolescent children, don't always think that they are ""all hormones"" and ignore them, let alone scold and limit their disorder.



Text: Carol Chen
Of course, he is not just a child.
Modern parents pay attention to education and education, and spend their heart and mind to lay a good road for children. However, we should also use the same intentions and input to understand whether children have enough psychological qualities to face many challenges in life. Because the world is not just a campus, it affects the future of children, not just performance.
One night, I was about to fall asleep. My daughter suddenly said to us seriously: ""I have something important to tell you."" She is so rare, we certainly have a back ridge and listen.
""I think my classmate M may want to shoot the school.""
This classmate M has been to our house. I have met him once. It doesn't look like an unhappy child. I was shocked and asked my daughter to explain what it was. It turned out that today they took turns to record the camera lens in a short time in the restaurant. When they finally recorded M, he said loudly to everyone, ""I am school shooter!"" It seems like a joke, so other students don't care, but the daughter and her good sister don't think so.
M recently had something happening at home, and his mood often fell into depression. This is because he and his daughter often chat, she only knows that he did not disclose the private affairs to other students. And the daughter also knows that M is very keen on weapons and weapons, and has seen some of his ""collections"", knowing that his father sometimes buys such ""toys"" for him. The daughter is not sure whether the things she sees are really lethal or just furnishings. But she has also heard that M invited other students to buy guns to play. No matter what the severity is, no one knows.
Is it serious? Still kidding?
The description of the daughter made us very nervous, because no one knows whether this is a ""joking"" or whether he really has such an intention. It is even more unclear whether he is exposed to real guns or just toys. My daughter has seen that the ""collections"" he shared in the social media are not only guns, but also tools, which may hurt themselves or others. After the discussion, our two parents immediately wrote an e-mail to the principal in the middle of the night, and told me to call the school immediately the next morning to confirm how the principal would handle the matter. I can hardly sleep all night. In the minds of the American high school shootings that I saw in the news before the carousel, I thought that M knew where our family was and had chased her daughter. My heart was very unstable. The photo film of the shooting was in my mind. Lingering.
Only seven o'clock the next day, the principal has already written back to us. They decided to let the police intervene in the previous experience of counseling M. The follow-up of our children may need to cooperate with the police investigation. The principal hopes that we understand the school's decision. Only after receiving the letter, the parents on both sides received the message from the daughters. Four police cars were parked at the entrance of the school. The police entered the campus and the school building search. Of course, it also included the lockers of M and the space used by all classrooms and students. Confirm if dangerous goods are present. Seeing so many policemen with live ammunition turned over the entire campus, it really scared many students, and even some children cried and said, ""I don't want to die."" The daughter tried to stay calm and comfort other students. This is only a preventive action, but in fact she is afraid of her own life!
After a few hours, the principal sent an official letter to all parents. Fortunately, the police did not find any dangerous goods. M will not return to school for the time being. He will be fully supervised by the parents at home. Please rest assured. The principal also talked to me privately. In addition to verbally reporting the progress of the school, he said very seriously, please take care to praise my daughter's bravery.
This ""information"" action is very important for the safety of the campus, but not all students are willing to do so. For teenagers, the recognition of peers is very important. No one wants to be the ""whistleblower"", and more often they think it is just a prank, joke, and laughter, don't mind too much. The principal has personally expressed his gratitude and praise to my daughter, but I still hope that I will encourage her again with my mother's role. Although the school did not announce which classmates had reported it, he still worried that his daughter would face the pressure of being a ""whistle-blower"" and even felt that she had done something wrong. I am grateful to the school for being open directly, and I am glad that I can communicate with my children on weekdays so that my daughter can bravely tell us when she feels wrong.
The principal said yes, the children of this age have to face more than we can imagine! We may think that this is the right thing, of course, but the world of children is not as simple as you think. Whether it is the tension of parental relationships, the pressure of academic work, the world of feelings, or even being bullied and frustrated in the classroom, it is possible to make this age child think that ""the end of the world is coming"" and make something sad. Children who are bullied are often used by adults to say ""You don't want to think so much"" or ""You don't care about them."" These words can't solve the dilemma that teenagers face every day. Can adults share their pressure? Or do we always think that ""they are just children"" and ignore the challenges they face at home or at school?
Don't think your child's world is full of pink bubbles.
For M classmates, the low pressure in the home, coupled with being excluded from the school, makes him feel depressed and angry at any time. These are the needs that should have been paid attention to; for the daughter, the secret of the good friend is announced. And the subsequent involvement of the students is also a great challenge. I am very grateful to the principal for reminding me of the phone call, so that I will pay special attention to my daughter's mood and reaction in the next few weeks and even months. Fortunately, all the students supported her decision and did not give her too much pressure. However, she was still overwhelmed by the psychological fear caused by M until she decided that M would transfer and move out of our city. She gradually felt relieved and returned to the laughter on weekdays.
Maybe you see it here, you will feel ""What's so fussing? Which boy doesn't like to play with a knife?"" ""Why do children jokingly say, why should they be serious?"" But then the police discovery may make everyone like me, shocked, and Never dare to ignore it.

This book is definitely not a ""promotion book"" for the IB school system, but simply a bit of a record of a mother and a child living in an IB school. In the middle, I wrote down the values conflicts, worries, and reflections that I faced as a mother in the process of my child's education. I also recorded the story of my daughter's ""turning adults"" over the years and the long-term impact on her. ——Caro Chen
The goal of your child's hard work is to develop into the best version of ""self""!
108 classes are officially on the road. Many parents are asking: ""What is literacy? Where to fill?"" ""Where is the evaluation volume?"" ""What is the learning process? How to download it?""
And slow! Literacy = knowledge + ability + attitude, can not be developed by tutoring, writing assessment; the learning process can not be downloaded, but to ""gradual upload every semester."" The world is changing faster and faster, and the traditional way of learning has not caught up. The reform of the education system in various countries is to cultivate talents who can truly face the challenges of the future. However, the most fundamental and crucial thing is the parents. Nothing wrong. Parents let go of myths, and children have a chance!

The European-born writer Kai Ruo chose the International Baccalaureate, which is mainly English-oriented and German-sponsored for the daughter who graduated from elementary school and moved from Taiwan to Germany, because of the plan to move across the country. It's just that the IB system has access to 150 countries around the world, and it has the advantage of being able to connect smoothly wherever you move. I did not expect this decision to make a mistake and actually change the daughter who originally declared ""I don't want to go to school.""

In the past four years, accompanying her daughter to study in Germany, Kai Ruo recognized that before pushing the children into the ""educational arms race"" or bitterly encouraging them to study and study, as parents, we must first think clearly about the ""educational"". significance. In the near future, the diplomas and licenses obtained in the twenties can only help us find the first job, and we must continue to upgrade ourselves to maintain our competitiveness.
And her 15-year-old daughter learned at the IB school in Germany: to understand the fun and significance of knowledge, to actively participate in learning systematic collection and analysis of information, to produce their own arguments, the ability to gradually internalize logical reasoning and oral expression. Always think about ""how to apply what you have learned to solve problems"" to explore yourself and find the ambition of life: sports management
These are the skills that children need to face the challenges of the future. The experience of Kairuo's family deserves a reference for every parent who cares about their children's education.

What is IB?

International Baccalaureate International Diploma, referred to as IB. It is a school system independent of the education system of each country, and its curriculum development and teaching methods are different from compulsory education in various countries. Now there are more than 150 countries in the world with IB schools, which provide students from 3-19 years old equivalent to primary school, middle school and high school. They emphasize internationalization and holistic education, attach importance to balanced development, and encourage students to explore themselves. independent thinking.
