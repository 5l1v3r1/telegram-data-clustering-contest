《華文散文百年選．中國大陸卷1》：魯迅〈阿Q正傳的成因〉
02 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是先前，我覺得我很有寫得「太過」的地方，近來卻不這樣想了。中國現在的事，即使如實描寫，在別國的人們，或將來的好中國的人們看來，也都會覺得grotesk。



文：魯迅
阿Q正傳的成因（1926）
在《文學週報》二五一期裡，西諦先生談起《吶喊》，尤其是〈阿Q正傳〉。這不覺引動我記起了一些小事情，也想藉此來說一說，一則也算是做文章，投了稿；二則還可以給要看的人去看去。
我先要抄一段西諦先生的原文：
這篇東西值得大家如此的注意，原不是無因的。但也有幾點值得商榷的，如最後「大團圓」的一幕，我在《晨報》上初讀此作之時，即不以為然，至今也還不以為然，似乎作者對於阿Q之收局太匆促了；他不欲再往下寫了，便如此隨意的給他以一個「大團圓」。像阿Q那樣的一個人，終於要做起革命黨來，終於受到那樣大團圓的結局，似乎連作者他自己在最初寫作時也是料不到的。至少在人格上似乎是兩個。
阿Q是否真要做革命黨，即使真做了革命黨，在人格上是否似乎是兩個，現在姑且勿論。單是這篇東西的成因，說起來就要很費工夫了。我常常說，我的文章不是湧出來的，是擠出來的。聽的人往往誤解為謙遜，其實是真情。我沒有什麼話要說，也沒有什麼文章要做，但有一種自害的脾氣，是有時不免吶喊幾聲，想給人們去添點熱鬧。譬如一匹疲牛罷，明知不堪大用的了，但廢物何妨利用呢，所以張家要我耕一弓地，可以的；李家要我挨一轉磨，也可以的；趙家要我在他店前站一刻，在我背上貼出廣告道：敝店備有肥牛，出售上等消毒滋養牛乳。我雖然深知道自己是怎麼瘦，又是公的，並沒有乳，然而想到他們為張羅生意起見，情有可原，只要出售的不是毒藥，也就不說什麼了。
但倘若用得我太苦，是不行的，我還要自己覓草吃，要喘氣的工夫；要專指我為某家的牛，將我關在他的牛牢內，也不行的，我有時也許還要給別家挨幾轉磨。如果連肉都要出賣，那自然更不行，理由自明，無須細說。倘遇到上述的三不行，我就跑，或者索性躺在荒山裡。即使因此忽而從深刻變為淺薄，從戰士化為畜生，嚇我以康有為，比我以梁啟超，也都滿不在乎，還是我跑我的，我躺我的，絕不出來再上當，因為我於「世故」實在是太深了。
近幾年《吶喊》有這許多人看，當初是萬料不到的，而且連料也沒有料。不過是依了相識者的希望，要我寫一點東西就寫一點東西。也不很忙，因為不很有人知道魯迅就是我。我所用的筆名也不只一個：LS、神飛、唐俟、某生者、雪之、風聲；更以前還有：自樹、索士、令飛、迅行。魯迅就是承迅行而來的，因為那時《新青年》編輯者不願意有別號一般的署名。
現在是有人以為我想做什麼狗首領了，真可憐，偵察了百來回，竟還不明白。我就從不曾插了魯迅的旗去訪過一次人；「魯迅即周樹人」，是別人查出來的。這些人有四類：一類是為要研究小說，因而要知道作者的身世；一類單是好奇；一類是因為我也做短評，所以特地揭出來，想我受點禍；一類是以為於他有用處，想要鑽進來。
那時我住在西城邊，知道魯迅就是我的，大概只有《新青年》、《新潮》社裡的人們罷；孫伏園也是一個。他正在晨報館編副刊。不知是誰的主意，忽然要添一欄稱為「開心話」的了，每周一次。他就來要我寫一點東西。
阿Q的影像，在我心目中似乎確已有了好幾年，但我一向毫無寫他出來的意思。經這一提，忽然想起來了，晚上便寫了一點，就是第一章：序。因為要切「開心話」這題目，就胡亂加上些不必有的滑稽，其實在全篇裡也是不相稱的。署名是「巴人」，取「下里巴人」，並不高雅的意思。誰料這署名又闖了禍了，但我卻一向不知道，今年在《現代評論》上看見涵廬（即高一涵）的「閒話」才知道的。那大略是：
……我記得當〈阿Q正傳〉一段一段陸續發表的時候，有許多人都慄慄危懼，恐怕以後要罵到他的頭上。並且有一位朋友，當我面說，昨日〈阿Q正傳〉上某一段彷彿就是罵他自己。因此便猜疑〈阿Q正傳〉是某人做的，何以呢？因為只有某人知道他這一段私事。……從此疑神疑鬼，凡是〈阿Q正傳〉中所罵的，都以為就是他的陰私；凡是與登載〈阿Q正傳〉的報紙有關係的投稿人，都不免做了他所認為〈阿Q正傳〉的作者的嫌疑犯了！等到他打聽出來〈阿Q正傳〉的作者名姓的時候，他才知道他和作者素不相識，因此，才恍然自悟，又逢人聲明說不是罵他。（第四卷第八十九期）
我對於這位「某人」先生很抱歉，竟因我而做了許多天嫌疑犯。可惜不知是誰，「巴人」兩字很容易疑心到四川人身上去，或者是四川人罷。直到這一篇收在《吶喊》裡，也還有人問我：你實在是在罵誰和誰呢？我只能悲憤，自恨不能使人看得我不至於如此下劣。
第一章登出之後，便「苦」字臨頭了，每七天必須做一篇。我那時雖然並不忙，然而正在做流民，夜晚睡在做通路的屋子裡，這屋子只有一個後窗，連好好的寫字地方也沒有，哪裡能夠靜坐一會，想一下。伏園雖然還沒有現在這樣胖，但已經笑嘻嘻，善於催稿了，每星期來一回，一有機會，就是：「先生，〈阿Q正傳〉……明天要付排了。」於是只得做，心裡想著，「俗語說：『討飯怕狗咬，秀才怕歲考。』我既非秀才，又要周考，真是為難……」然而終於又一章。但是，似乎漸漸認真起來了；伏園也覺得不很「開心」，所以從第二章起，便移在「新文藝」欄裡。
這樣地一周一周挨下去，於是乎就不免發生阿Q可要做革命黨的問題了。據我的意思，中國倘不革命，阿Q便不做，既然革命，就會做的。我的阿Q的運命，也只能如此，人格也恐怕並不是兩個。民國元年已經過去，無可追蹤了，但此後倘再有改革，我相信還有阿Q似的革命黨出現。我也很願意如人們所說，我只寫出了現在以前的或一時期，但我還恐怕我所看見的並非現代的前身，而是其後，或者竟是二三十年之後。其實這也不算辱沒了革命黨，阿Q究竟已經用竹筷盤上他的辮子了；此後十五年，長虹「走到出版界」，不也就成為一個中國的「綏惠略夫」了麼？
〈阿Q正傳〉大約做了兩個月，我實在很想收束了，但我已經記不大清楚，似乎伏園不贊成，或者是我疑心倘一收束，他會來抗議，所以將「大團圓」藏在心裡，而阿Q卻已經漸漸向死路上走。到最末的一章，伏園倘在，也許會壓下，而要求放阿Q多活幾星期的罷。但是「會逢其適」，他回去了，代庖的是何作霖君，於阿Q素無愛憎，我便將「大團圓」送去，他便登出來。待到伏園回京，阿Q已經槍斃了一個多月了。縱令伏園怎樣善於催稿，如何笑嘻嘻，也無法再說「先生，〈阿Q正傳〉……」。從此我總算收束了一件事，可以另幹別的去。另幹了別的什麼，現在也已經記不清，但大概還是這一類的事。
其實「大團圓」倒不是「隨意」給他的；至於初寫時可曾料到，那倒確乎也是一個疑問。我彷彿記得：沒有料到。不過這也無法，誰能開首就料到人們的「大團圓」？不但對於阿Q，連我自己將來的「大團圓」，我就料不到究竟是怎樣。終於是「學者」，或「教授」乎？還是「學匪」或「學棍」呢？「官僚」乎，還是「刀筆吏」呢？「思想界之權威」乎，抑「思想界先驅者」乎，抑又「世故的老人」乎？「藝術家」？「戰士」？抑又是見客不怕麻煩的特別「亞拉籍夫」乎？乎？乎？乎？乎？
但阿Q自然還可以有各種別樣的結果，不過這不是我所知道的事。
先前，我覺得我很有寫得「太過」的地方，近來卻不這樣想了。中國現在的事，即使如實描寫，在別國的人們，或將來的好中國的人們看來，也都會覺得grotesk。我常常假想一件事，自以為這是想得太奇怪了；但倘遇到相類的事實，卻往往更奇怪。在這事實發生以前，以我的淺見寡識，是萬萬想不到的。
大約一個多月以前，這裡槍斃一個強盜，兩個穿短衣的人各拿手槍，一共打了七槍。不知道是打了不死呢，還是死了仍然打，所以要打得這麼多。當時我便對我的一群少年同學們發感慨，說：這是民國初年初用槍斃的時候的情形；現在隔了十多年，應該進步些，無須給死者這麼多的苦痛。北京就不然，犯人未到刑場，刑吏就從後腦一槍，結果了性命，本人還來不及知道已經死了呢。所以北京究竟是「首善之區」，便是死刑，也比外省的好得遠。
但是前幾天看見十一月二十三日的北京《世界日報》，又知道我的話並不的確了，那第六版上有一條新聞，題目是「杜小拴子刀鍘而死」，共分五節，現可撮錄一節在下面：
杜小拴子刀鍘餘人槍斃　先時，衛戌司令部因為從了毅軍各兵士的請求，決定用「梟首刑」，所以杜等不曾到場以前，刑場預備好了鍘草大刀一把了。刀是長形的，下邊是木底，中縫有厚大而銳利的刀一把，刀下頭有一孔，橫嵌木上，可以上下的活動，杜等四人入刑場之後，由招扶的兵士把杜等架下刑車，就叫他們臉沖北，對著已備好的刑棹前站著。……杜並沒有跪，有外右五區的某巡官去問杜：要人把著不要？杜就笑而不答，後來就自己跑到刀前，自己睡在刀上，仰面受刑，先時行刑兵已將刀抬起，杜枕到適宜的地方後，行刑兵就合眼猛力一鍘，杜的身首，就不在一處了。當時血出極多。在旁邊跪等槍決的宋振山等三人，也各偷眼去看，中有趙振一名，身上還發起顫來。後由某排長拿手槍站在宋等的後面，先斃宋振山，後斃李有三趙振，每人都是一槍斃命。……先時，被害程步墀的兩個兒子忠智忠信，都在場觀看，放聲大哭，到各人執刑之後，去大喊：爸！媽呀！你的仇已報了！我們怎麼辦哪？聽的人都非常難過，後來由家族引導著回家去了。
假如有一個天才，真感著時代的心搏，在十一月二十二日發表出記敘這樣情景的小說來，我想，許多讀者一定以為是說著包龍圖爺爺時代的事，在西曆十一世紀，和我們相差將有九百年。
這真是怎麼好……。
至於〈阿Q正傳〉的譯本，我只看見過兩種。法文的登在八月份的《歐羅巴》上，還止三分之一，是有刪節的。英文的似乎譯得很懇切，但我不懂英文，不能說什麼。只是偶然看見還有可以商榷的兩處：一是「三百大錢九二串」當譯為「三百大錢，以九十二文作為一百」的意思；二是「柿油黨」不如譯音，因為原是「自由黨」，鄉下人不能懂，便訛成他們能懂的「柿油黨」了。

""Chinese prose for a hundred years. Mainland China Volume 1: Lu Xun's Cause of the True Story of Ah Q
02 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is the previous one. I think I have a place that is too ""too much"". I haven't thought about it recently. China's current affairs, even if it is true, will be grotesk in the eyes of people in other countries, or in the future.



Text: Lu Xun
The cause of Ah Q's biography (1926)
In the literary weekly 251, Mr. Xi Wei talked about ""Scream"", especially the ""AQ True Story"". This does not motivate me to remember some small things, but also want to use this to say that one is also a fuss, cast a manuscript; the second can also be seen for the person to see.
I have to copy a copy of Mr. Xi’s original text:
This thing deserves everyone's attention, it is not without cause. However, there are also some points that are worth discussing. For example, when I first read this work in the Morning Post, I didn’t take it for granted. I still don’t think so. It seems that the author’s acceptance of Ah Q is too hasty; He didn't want to write down any more, so he gave him a ""great reunion"". A person like Ah Q, who finally started the revolutionary party, finally got the result of such a happy reunion, and it seems that even the author himself did not expect it at the time of his initial writing. At least in personality seems to be two.
Whether Ah Q really wants to be a revolutionary party, even if it is really a revolutionary party, whether it seems to be two in personality, let’s talk about it now. The cause of this thing alone is very laborious to say. I often say that my article is not coming out, it is squeezed out. The person who listens is often misunderstood as humility, but it is true. I don't have anything to say, and there is no article to do, but there is a kind of temper that is self-harming. Sometimes I can't help but scream a few times and want to add some excitement to people. For example, if you are tired of a cow, you know that it can't be used. But the waste can be used, so Zhang wants me to cultivate a bow. Yes, Li Jia wants me to turn around, but I can. Zhao wants me to He stood in front of the store for a moment, and posted an advertisement on my back: the store has beef cattle and sells the best disinfection and nourishing milk. Although I know how thin and public, and there is no milk, I think that they are for the sake of Zhang Luo’s business. It is justifiable, as long as the sale is not poison, it will not say anything.
But if I use it too hard, it will not work. I have to eat grass and eat it myself. I have to take a breather. I must refer to the cow of a certain family and shut me down in his bull. I will not do it. Sometimes it may be necessary to give others a few turns. If even the meat has to be sold, it will naturally not work. The reason is self-evident, and there is no need to elaborate. If you encounter the above three, I will run, or simply lay in the barren hills. Even if I suddenly changed from deep to shallow, from warrior to beast, scared me to be awkward, and I didn’t care if I used Liang Qichao, or I ran my, I lay down, never came out, because I was The world is really too deep.
In recent years, ""Scream"" has been seen by many people. It was unexpectedly unexpected, and the materials were not expected. However, according to the hope of the acquaintance, I have to write something when I write something. Not very busy, because not very people know that Lu Xun is me. I have used more than one pen name: LS, Shenfei, Tang Yin, a living person, snow, and wind; more than before: from the tree, Suo Shi, Ling Fei, Xun Xing. Lu Xun came from Cheng Xun, because the editors of ""New Youth"" were not willing to have a special signature.
Now someone thinks that I want to be a dog leader. It’s really pitiful. I’ve scouted a hundred back and forth, but I still don’t understand. I have never been to Lu Xun’s flag to visit a person; ""Lu Xun is Zhou Shuren"", which was discovered by others. There are four types of these people: one is to study the novel, so it is necessary to know the author's life; one is curious; the other is because I also make a short comment, so I specifically reveal it, think that I am suffering; one is useful for him. I want to get in.
At that time, I lived in the West Side and knew that Lu Xun was mine. It was probably only the people in ""New Youth"" and ""New Wave"". Sun Fuyuan was also one. He is editing a supplement in the morning newspaper. I don't know who's the idea. I suddenly want to add a column called ""Happy Words"", once a week. He came to ask me to write something.
The image of Ah Q seems to have been in my mind for several years, but I have never written what he meant. After this mention, I suddenly remembered it. I wrote a little at night, which is the first chapter: Preface. Because it is necessary to cut the subject of ""happy words"", it is indiscriminate to add some unnecessary comics in the whole article. The signature is ""Pak Man"" and the ""Linba"" is not elegant. I don’t know if this signature is a curse, but I don’t know it. I saw this in the Modern Review on the ""gossip"" of Han Yu (ie, Gao Yihan). That is roughly:
... I remember that when the ""AQ True Story"" was published one after another, many people were reluctant to fear, and I am afraid I will get on his head in the future. And there is a friend, when I said that a paragraph on the ""AQ True Story"" yesterday seems to be jealous of himself. Therefore, it is suspected that the ""AQ True Story"" is made by someone. Why? Because only someone knows his private affairs. ...... From this doubt, all the sorrows in the ""AQ True Story"" are thought to be his sinfulness; any contributor who has a relationship with the newspaper that published the ""AQ True Story"" can not help but think that he is saying The suspect of the author of 〉! When he inquired about the name of the author of ""AQ True Story"", he knew that he and the author had never met each other. Therefore, he realized that he was self-conscious, and everyone said that he was not jealous. (Fourth Volume Eighty-ninth)
I am very sorry for this ""someone"", and I have been a lot of suspects for me. It is a pity that I don't know who it is. The word ""Pak"" is easy to suspect to the Sichuanese, or the Sichuanese. Until this one was included in ""Scream"", there are still people who ask me: Who are you and who are you? I can only be sorrowful and angry. I can’t make people see that I am not so bad.
After the first chapter was published, the word ""bitter"" came to an end and an article must be made every seven days. I was not busy at the time, but I was doing the refugees. I slept in the room where I was working at night. There was only one rear window in the room. I didn’t even have a good place to write. I could sit still and think about it. Although Fuyuan is not as fat as it is now, it is already smiling and good at manuscripts. Every week, once upon a time, there is a chance: ""Mr., ""The True Story of Ah Q..."" I have to pay for it tomorrow."" So I have to do it. I thought to myself, ""The saying goes: ""Begging for a dog bite, the show is afraid of the age test."" I am neither a scholar nor a weekly test, it is really difficult..."" But finally another chapter. However, it seems to be getting serious. Fuyuan also feels that it is not very happy. Therefore, from the second chapter, it will be moved to the ""New Literature"" column.
This way, it will go down one week a week, so it is inevitable that Ah Q can be a problem for the revolutionary party. According to my point of view, if China does not revolution, Ah Q will not do it. Since the revolution, it will be done. The fate of my Ah Q can only be so, and I am afraid that there are not two personalities. The first year of the Republic of China has passed, and there is no traceability. However, if there is any reform afterwards, I believe that there will be a revolutionary party like Ah Q. I am also very willing to say that I have only written the previous or a period of time, but I am afraid that what I have seen is not the modern predecessor, but it is later, or twenty or thirty years later. In fact, this is not a shame for the Revolutionary Party. Ah Q has already used bamboo chopsticks to plate his nephews; in the next fifteen years, Changhong ""goes to the publishing world"" and does not become a Chinese ""绥惠夫夫"". What?
""AQ is a true biography"" for about two months, I really want to close, but I have not remembered clearly, it seems that Fuyuan does not agree, or I am suspicious if it is closed, he will come to protest, so will ""The big reunion"" is hidden in the heart, and Ah Q has gradually gone to the dead. In the last chapter, if the garden is in place, it may be depressed, and it is required to let Ah Q live for a few more weeks. However, ""it will be suitable for him."" He went back. He was the one who was a singer, and he did not love it. I sent the ""great reunion"" and he went out. After returning to Fuyuan to return to Beijing, Ah Q has been shot for more than a month. In the light of how Fuyuan is good at reminding manuscripts, how can you laugh and you can’t say ""Mr., ""The True Story of Ah Q..."". Since then, I have finally collected one thing, and I can do something else. I have done something else, but I can’t remember it now, but it’s probably something like this.
In fact, ""great reunion"" is not ""free"" to him; as for the initial writing, it is indeed a question. I seem to remember: I didn't expect it. However, this is not possible. Who can start to expect people's ""great reunion""? Not only for Ah Q, but even my own future ""great reunion"", I don't know what it is. Is it finally a ""scholar"" or a ""professor""? Still ""study"" or ""study stick""? ""Bureaucracy"" or ""knife and pen""? ""Is the authority of the ideological world"", the ""heroes of the ideological world"", and the ""old man of the world""? ""artist""? ""warrior""? Is it a special ""Yala nationality"" who is not afraid of trouble? What? What? What? What?
But Ah Q can naturally have a variety of different results, but this is not what I know.
Previously, I felt that I was very ""written too"", but I didn't think so recently. China's current affairs, even if it is true, will be grotesk in the eyes of people in other countries, or in the future. I often imagine one thing and think that it is too strange to think about it; but it is often stranger if you encounter similar facts. Before this fact happened, my ignorance was unthinkable.
About a month ago, a robber was shot here, and two people in shorts each took a pistol and shot a total of seven. I don't know if I won't die, or I still die, so I have to play so much. At that time, I sent a feeling to my group of young students, saying: This is the situation when the Republic of China was shot at the beginning of the new year; now, after more than ten years, it should be improved, without giving the deceased so much pain. In Beijing, the prisoner did not arrive at the execution ground. The prisoner took a shot from the back of the head and ended up with a life. I still have no time to know that I am dead. Therefore, Beijing is the ""first good district"", it is the death penalty, and it is far better than the other provinces.
But a few days ago, I saw Beijing’s “World Journal” on November 23, and I knew that my words were not true. There was a news on the sixth edition, titled “Du Xiaozi’s knife died and died”. The five sections are now available in the following section:
Du Xiaozi's knife and other people's guns. At first, the defending headquarters decided to use the ""decapitation penalty"" because of the request of the soldiers of the Yijun army. Therefore, before Du et al. was not present, the execution ground was ready to scribble. The knife is long, the bottom is the wooden bottom, the middle seam has a thick and sharp knife, the knife has a hole under the head, horizontally embedded on the wood, can move up and down, Du and other four people enter the execution ground, by Zhao Zhao The soldiers put Du and other vehicles on the vehicle, and they called their faces to the north and stood before the prepared prison. ... Du is not embarrassed, there is a patrol officer in the outer right five districts to ask Du: Do you want people to take it? Du laughed and didn't answer. Later, he ran to the knife and slept on the knife. He was tortured on the back. The first executioner had lifted the knife. After the pillow was placed in a suitable place, the executioner would look at the force. Du’s body is not in one place. At that time, there was a lot of blood. Three people, such as Song Zhenshan, who was shot next to him, also sneaked into each other. There was Zhao Zhen in the middle, and the body also started to tremble. After a platoon leader took a pistol and stood behind Song, etc., first sang Song Zhenshan, then 有 Li Yousan Zhao Zhen, each one was a shot. ... At the first time, the two sons of the murdered Chengbu, Zhongzhi Zhongxin, were present and watched, crying loudly, and after each sentence, shouted: Dad! Mom! Your hatred has been reported! What do we do? The people who listened were very sad, and later they were led home by the family.
If there is a genius, I really feel the heart of the times, and on November 22nd, I will publish a novel about such a scene. I think many readers must think that it is the story of the grandfather of Baolongtu, in the Western calendar. In the eleventh century, there will be nine hundred years of difference with us.
How is this really good...
As for the translation of ""The True Story of Ah Q"", I have only seen two kinds. French is on the Europa in August, and it is still a third. It is abridged. English seems to be translated very well, but I don't know English and can't say anything. Just by chance, there are two places that can be discussed: one is ""three hundred big money, ninety-two strings"", which translates to ""three hundred big money, with ninety-two texts as one hundred""; the second is that ""persimmon oil party"" is not as good as transliteration. Because it was originally a ""liberal party,"" the country people couldn't understand it, and they became a ""persimmon party"" that they could understand.
