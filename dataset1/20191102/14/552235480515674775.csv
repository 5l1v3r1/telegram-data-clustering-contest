Former Rangers captain Lee Wallace makes his first start in over two years as he finally makes his Queens Park Rangers debut.
The left-back struggled with injuries during the latter days of his Rangers career, and also spent time away from the squad after disciplinary proceedings were opened against him and Kenny Miller.
Wallace made three appearances for Steven Gerrard 's side last season, all of which came from the bench, before leaving on a free transfer.
He then signed for former manager Mark Warburton at Loftus Road, but hasn't made a single appearance for QPR so far.
Wallace is in the starting XI for today's match against Leeds United at Elland Road though, his first start in over two years.

The former Scotland international was named in the Rangers starting XI for a match against Partick Thistle on September 15 2017, but was forced off with injury after 12 minutes.
That was his last start in a competitive game, and his last 90 minutes came in a 4-1 win over Dundee on September 9 two years ago.
Wallace made 256 appearances for Rangers, playing at every level of the SPFL and scoring 25 goals.
