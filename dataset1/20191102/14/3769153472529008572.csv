I worked as a VFX supervisor and artist for the BYU student film, ""Gather,"" directed by Howie Burbidge. I used Blender for some of the visual effects. I'm proud to have worked on this, as well as be part of a 3D community that helped me along the way.For more details about the effects, you can visit my portfolio page on it, or feel free to ask me by leaving a comment below.
