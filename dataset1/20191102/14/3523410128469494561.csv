Jerusalem (AFP) - Israel carried out retaliatory strikes on Gaza Saturday killing a Palestinian and wounding two others, following two nights of rocket attacks that were the first since September.
Hamas, the Islamist rulers of Gaza, denounced a ""serious escalation"" and said Israel will be held ""responsible for the consequences"" of the raids.
Dozens of pre-dawn strikes targeted Hamas bases and those of allied militant groups, a Gaza security source said.
The Israeli army said the strikes targeted ""a wide range of Hamas terror targets"", including a naval base, a military compound and a weapons manufacturing plant.
The Hamas-run health ministry identified the person killed as Ahmed al-Shehri, 27. It did not say whether he was affiliated with any armed group. Two other Palestinians were seriously wounded, the ministry said.
Hundreds of Palestinians attended Shehri's funeral on Saturday in the southern Gaza Strip, an AFP correspondent said.
The sound of explosions had been heard across the tiny but densely populated territory, AFP correspondents said.
After daybreak, curious onlookers gathered around a large crater scooped out of the sandy soil by the force of one of the blasts.
A Hamas source said it had fired at the Israeli aircraft carrying out the raids and the Israeli military confirmed fresh ""incoming fire"".
""The Zionist enemy bears full responsibility for the consequences,"" of the pre-dawn air raids, Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said in a statement.
He said the strikes targeted ""innocent civilians"" and represented a ""serious escalation"".
- Sworn enemies -
The strikes came after at least 10 rockets were fired from Gaza at southern Israel late Friday causing damage but no casualties.
Local officials in Gaza said installations of Islamic Jihad, another prominent militant group operating in the coastal enclave, were also hit.
The Israeli military said eight of the rockets were intercepted by air defences.
Air raid sirens sounded in Israeli communities near the border.
One family's house was hit, without causing any casualties, the army said, posting a picture of damage to a building on Twitter.
It was the second consecutive evening that the army reported rocket fire from Gaza, shattering a calm that had lasted since September 12.
In August, a spate of rocket attacks, retaliatory air strikes and clashes along the border had raised fears of an escalation as a general election approached in Israel.
Those polls -- Israel's second general election this year -- took place on September 17, but have yet to yield a new government.
Sworn enemies Israel and Hamas have fought three wars in the Palestinian enclave since 2008.
Analysts say a fourth round remains likely.
- Crippling blockade -
There have been repeated bouts of violence between Hamas and Israel over the past year as the Islamists have sought to improve on the terms of a UN- and Egyptian-brokered truce first hammered out in November last year.
In return for Hamas silencing the rockets, Israel agreed a package of measures to ease the crippling blockade it has imposed on Gaza for more than a decade.
They included allowing in millions of dollars in aid from Hamas ally Qatar to pay for fuel for the territory's sole power station and cash for salaries and grants to tens of thousands of needy families.
The truce has also seen Israel expand the distance it allows Gaza fishermen out into the Mediterranean -- although the Jewish state reduces it or even cuts it to zero in response to violence from the enclave.
The concessions authorised by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have been criticised by his opponents, including by his challenger for the premiership, centrist former military chief Benny Gantz.
Gantz called a renewal of the truce agreed by Netanyahu in May ""capitulation to blackmail"".
The Palestinians have also pressed on with weekly demonstrations along the Gaza-Israel border first launched in March last year.
The protests have frequently drawn live fire from Israeli forces stationed along the heavily fortified border fence.
More than 90 Palestinians were wounded in this Friday's demonstrations, the health ministry said.

۱۲ Super Vampire Cinema Movie {Part Two}

The antiquity of the vampire genre is close to the cinema itself.
02 Nov 2019, 14:27 by Bulletin News | bultannews.com
Arts and Culture: The Vulture genre is something close to the cinema itself. The genre began with Friedrich Wilhelm Mornau's ""Nosferatu"" in Year 2, and since then numerous films have frightened audiences at the same time. From that point on, in every genre and every country that has had something to say in the field of filmmaking, the genre has gone on display. Although this genre has many classics, we decided to write one of the top five films of the vampire genre.

1- Isle Of The Dead (Mark Robson, 2)

Warolaka! It is evil and full of sin and ruin. Your hands are infected with violence. Your mouth has tasted of sin and ruin. You are guilty and disgusted. Warolaka! Warolaka!
""Island of the Dead"" resembles the ""wizard"" with the ""energy vampire"" television version of ""What We Do in the Shadows"" as a supernatural threat.
This year's horror film, RKOV Leighton, is a 5-minute story of people quarantined by a plague on a remote island in Greece in year 2. Among them is an Army Colonel (Boris Karlov) who is fighting off his troops in the First Balkan War (Leuton loved certain scenes that no other Hollywood producer was willing to think about) and a young, beautiful woman. By the name of Thea (Ellen Drew). An elderly woman strongly accuses Thea of causing the plague and imminent death. This old woman believes that Thea is a Vorulaka, a vampire model of Greek myths who takes the energy of other people and keeps her young and alive forever.

1- Cronos (Gearmo del Toro, 2)




Geiremo del Toro's first film as a director, after his first short and television film, is a story of immortal attraction that is visually unpredictable. The film also gained popularity as one of the most famous non-orthodox cinematic talents. In terms of the special aprons that later summarized Deltouro's career, Cronos was ahead of his time. The film uses techniques that were only used in the post-production stages when filming. The film is about an antique smuggler (Federico Lupi) who gets infected by an old device and becomes immortal. Cinematographer Gearmo Nabaro (Oscar-winner for the film ""The Labyrinth of Penn"") and composer Javier Alvarez add strange dimensions to this strange vampire story.

1- Only Lovers Left Alive (Jim Jarmusch, 2)




If the ""aurora"" -like vampires changed their angry looks with expressions of carelessness, they had something in common with Adam (Tom Huddleston) and Eva (Tilda Swinton), the cool vampires ""only lovers survived"" Jim Jarmusch. Interestingly, in Jarmusch's world, even vampires have traces of life in them. If you are the kind of audience that is patient and can cope with the philosophical extremes of Jarmusch and the cruel faces of his characters, this vampire movie encourages you to keep going even if you have no motivation to do so. Even though the vampire Swinton is sighing and thinking about the past, ""for us all is over."" But ""Only Lovers Survived"" is a movie that shows one of America's top art directors still has a lot to say.

The Hunger (Tony Scott, 2)




The idea for a successful and unexpected film at the Sundance Film Festival, Go Fish, is taken from this film. ""Hunger"" tells the story of Cartoon Deno in the role of an attractive woman who is coming to terms with the death of her love (David Bowie), until she falls in love with a young doctor.

1- Let the Right One In (Thomas Alfredson, 2)




The first episode of the ""Aurora"" movie series had become hot with vampire films, but at the same time, Thomas Alfredson's romantic gothic, along with other works of the genre, seemed quite strange. The film is about a 5-year-old boy who befriends a vampire girl. Snow scenes are a remake of the film that fills the life of the main character of the film and reveals the secret of this new friend. A friend who protects him from neighborhood bullying. Alfredson beautifully depicts details of the vampire's nature - along with the contrast between the strange power of the girl and the special innocence seen on her child's face - that helps portray a scary story. Elie tells the Oscars in the film, ""I am 5 years old, but I have been 2 years long.""

Nosferatu (Friedrich Wilhelm Mornauo, 1)




The movie Nosferatu, the godfather of vampire cinema, Mornau, began his career as an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula of the Year novel and ended it as one of the most influential horror films in cinema history. Max Shrek remembers one of the most beautiful silent roles in the genre as Kent Overlake, a vampire in Transylvania whose feelings for the wife of a real estate consultant have dreadful and tragic consequences.
