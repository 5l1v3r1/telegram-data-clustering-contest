Three Norwegians secured gold in Sweden after eleven-game drama: - Absolutely incredibly sick
It looked dark for Djurg√•rden in the last match of the season, after they ended up under 0-2 for Norrk√∂ping. Then they woke up, played 2‚Äì2 and won Allsvenskan.

The case is being updated.


It could hardly be more even at the top of the Allsvenskan before everything was decided. Six Norwegians struggled to lift the gifting trophy before Saturday's final round.

These Norwegians were involved in the gold battle:


Djurg√•rden: Fredrik Ulvestad, Aslak Fonn Witry, Per Kristian Br√•tveit
Hammarby: Dennis Widgren (half Norwegian), Mats Solheim
Malm√∂: Jo Inge Berget

In addition, AIK players Daniel Granli and Tarik Elyounoussi were able to take a medal.

Eight Norwegians involved in eleven good gold matches: - It's madness


Facts: Players' Past:
Fredrik Ulvestad (27) broke through in Aalesund. Then he went to Brighton before getting ready for Djurg√•rden in 2018.
Aslak Fonn Witry (23) played for Rosenborg in his youth. Last year, he broke through in the Elite Series for Ranheim. That made Djurg√•rden interested.
Per Kristian Br√•tveit (23) is a well-known face for elite series experts. The former Haugesund keeper has over 100 matches for the club. Came to Djurg√•rden this year.
Dennis Widgren (25) has a father from Steinkjer. He has not played football in Norway before. Previously played for √ñstersund before coming to Hammarby this year. He has represented Sweden at the U19 level.
Mats Solheim (31) played for Sogndal from 2006 to 2011. Then went to Kalmar. Get ready for Hammarby in 2015.
Jo Inge Berget (29) is a well-known profile in Football Norway. He has 20 internationals. This year he came to Malm√∂ from New York City.
Daniel Granli (25) has been stuck on the slopes for Stab√¶k for a number of years. He came to AIK this year.
Tarik Elyounoussi (31) has 58 international matches for Norway. He has played for, among others, Rosenborg, Heerenveen, Hoffenheim and Olympiakos. Come to AIK in 2018.

turnaround
Djurg√•rden finally drew the longest straw for the gold, but that was it. They were under 0-2 for Norrk√∂ping for a break and everything looked anything but bright. Then led both Malm√∂ and Hammarby, which made Djurg√•rden number three. Malm√∂ looked to take his 24th series gold.
Then Jesper Karlstr√∂m reduced to 1-2, before Mohamed Buya Turay headed the equalizer after 65 minutes. Then it was Djurg√•rden who was at the top of the table, the point ahead of Malm√∂ and Hammarby.
Both Malm√∂ and Hammarby both did the job, but to no avail. Djurg√•rden took the one point they needed and ended up with 66 points.

There was a storm and complete chaos when Djurg√•rden secured the gold.üì∑ JESPER ZERMAN / BILDBYR√ÖN

With that, the club won its eleventh Allsvenskan title, and its first since 2005. When the referee blew off, there was a blast from the visiting fans from Djurg√•rden.
- It is incredibly sick. Look at these fucking players, then! I didn't feel good during the break, but I had faith in it. So head south, says sports director Bosse Andersson just after the match.

It is storming around former Fire coach: - Norling's reputation has gotten a scratch in the paint

Malm√∂ became angry
Both Fredrik Ulvestad and Aslak Fonn Witry played the entire match for Djurg√•rden - Ulvestad as defensive midfield, Witry as right back. On the Djurg√•rden bench also sat the Norwegian keeper Per Kristian Br√•tveit, who has played one third of the matches this season.
Malm√∂ finished second, while Hammarby became third. AIK was number four. These became the medal winners. The reason for this is that in Swedish football, they receive the first four medals: Gold for the series winner, big silver for the rider, small silver for the rider and bronze for the four.
Also at the bottom of the table it was even before the last series round, with four teams able to move down. Sundsvall and Eskilstuna are the two teams that must make the heavy trip down to Superettan. Kalmar will qualify.
