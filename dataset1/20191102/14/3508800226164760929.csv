我們想讓你知道的是是的，我和我的寫作皆以南方為家，但我常常覺得我無家可歸。



文：蘇童
南方是什麼（2009）
好多年前的一個下午，我在一座火柴盒似的工房的三層樓上眺望著視線中一條狹窄的破舊的小街，這是我最熟悉的窮街陋巷之一，也是多少年來被市政建設所遺忘的一條小街—是一條沒有建設必要的小街，它的一頭通往一座清代同治年間修建的石拱橋，另一頭通往近郊的某某大隊的農田和曬穀場（六、七○年代），或者通往新的環城公路和一片新興的混雜著國營企業村辦企業的工廠區（八○年代）。我在午後的陽光中眺望那條小街時忽然記起來我小時候是怎麼走過那裡去我母親所在的工廠食堂吃午飯的，我記得橋下的公共廁所，小街從這頭到那頭的大多數人家的家庭主婦和與我同齡的孩子，我記得他們在路人的視線裡匍在餐桌前吃午飯的情景。
令我感歎的是好多年過去了，公共廁所還在那裡，石子路鋪上了水泥，但路面還是那麼狹窄而濕漉漉的，人們還是享受著狹窄帶來的方便，非常輕易地就可以把晾衣服的竹竿架在對鄰的房頂上，走路和騎自行車的人仍然在被單、毛線、西裝、褲子甚至內衣下面穿行，這是我最熟悉的小街的街景，紊亂不潔的視覺印象中透出鮮活的生命的氣息。一些老人一定已經死了，大多數人還活著，大多數人在小街上養育著兒女甚至兒女的兒女。小街的日常生活一切依舊，就像一隻老式的掛鐘，它就那麼消化一個轟轟烈烈的時代，消化著日曆上的時間和新聞報導中的事件，它的鐘擺走動得很慢，卻鎮定自若，這鐘擺老氣橫秋地糾正著我腦子裡的某種追求速度和變化的偏見：慢，並不代表著走時不準，不變，並不代表著死亡。
那天下午我突然聽到了一條南方小街的生存告白，這告白因為簡潔而生動，因為世俗而深刻，我被它的莫名其妙的力量所打動：
我從來沒有如此深情地描摹我出生的香椿樹街，歌頌一條蒼白的缺乏人情味的石子路面，歌頌兩排無始無終的破舊醜陋的舊式民房，歌頌街上蒼蠅飛來飛去帶有黴菌味的空氣，歌頌出沒在黑洞洞的窗口裡的那些體形瘦小面容猥瑣的街坊鄰居。我生長在南方，這就像一顆被飛雁銜著的草籽一樣，不由自己把握，但我厭惡南方的生活由來已久，這是香椿樹街留給我的永恆的印記。
這是我在那年夏天寫的一部中篇小說《南方的墮落》中的開頭部分。現在我應該解釋它，可我發現我讓自己陷入了困境，我在自己的寫作中發現了一種敵意，這種敵意針對著一個虛構的或現實中的處所：南方。南方是什麼？南方代表著什麼？而我所流露的對南方的敵意又意味著什麼呢？
也許首先來自對回憶本身的敵意。人們在回憶之前通常會給自己的回憶規定一種情感立場，粉飾性的美好的戚傷的，或者冷靜的客觀的力求再現歷史的，而我恰好選擇了一種冷酷得幾乎像復仇者一樣的回憶姿態。這是一種偏執的難以解釋的敵意。我的所謂南方生活僅僅來自於我個人的生活與某個地點的關係的機械的劃定，我的南方是一條橫亙在記憶中的六○年代、七○年代的街道，而我當時是個孩子。一個孩子對周圍世界的認識是模糊的，同時也是不確定的，如果說人們對事物的敵意來自此事物對你潛在的或者明顯的傷害，我現在卻不能準確地描寫這種傷害的細節，因此我懷疑這份敵意可能是沒有理由的。
所有借助於回憶的描述並不可靠，因此不值得信任，就像我在某篇文章中提及我的一個小學老師，我一直認為我對她的記憶非常深刻，我以為我在還原一個過去的人物，可是甚至她的籍貫和家庭背景後來都被我的其他小學老師證明是證誤的，唯一準確的是我對她外形面貌的描述。一個事實有時讓你恐慌，可靠的東西存在於現實之中，卻不存在於回憶之中，如此我不得不懷疑我的敵意了，這敵意其實也不可靠。我也不得不懷疑我的南方，它到底在哪裡，我有過一個南方的故鄉嗎？
大家所崇敬的阿根廷作家波赫士恰好有一個美妙無比的短篇小說，名字就叫〈南方〉。「誰都知道里瓦達維亞的那一側就是南方的開始。」在這篇小說裡，南方是從一個地名開始延伸其意義的，而病病歪歪的主人公達爾曼與他手中的《一千零一夜》以及「南方」形成一個孔武有力的三角關係，支撐著作家所欲表達的所有思想空間。達爾曼來到南方，《一千零一夜》始終無法掩蓋殘暴的冰冷的現實，在雜貨鋪裡，有人向病中的達爾曼扔麵包心搓成的小球，於是一個世界上最不適合決鬥的人不得不接受一把冰冷的匕首。
南方的意義在這裡也許是一種處境的符號化的表達。
我的南方在哪裡呢？我對南方知道多少呢？
在我從小生長的那條街道的北端有一家茶館，茶館一面枕河，一面傍橋，一面朝向大街，是一座老舊的二層木樓，很長一段時間裡，我像一個善於取景的電影導演一樣把它設置為所謂南方的標誌物。我努力回憶那裡的人們，燒老虎灶的起初是一個老婦人，後來老婦人年歲大了，幹不動了，來了一個新的經營者，也是女的，年輕了好多，兩代女人手持鐵鍬往灶膛裡添加礱糠時的表情驚人地相似，她們皺著眉頭，嘴裡永遠嘀咕著發著什麼牢騷，似乎埋怨著生活，似乎享受著生活，她們勞動的表情是我後來描寫的南方女性的表情的依據。
更重要的參照物是一些坐著說話的人，坐在油膩的八仙桌前用廉價的宜興陶具喝茶的那些人，曾經被我規定為最典型的南方的居民，他們悠閒、瑣碎、饒舌、扎堆，他們對政治和國家大事很感興趣，可是談論起來言不及義鼠目寸光，他們不經意地談論飲食和菜餚，卻顯示出獨特的個人品味和淵博的知識，他們坐在那裡，在離家一公里以內的地方冒險、放縱自己，他們嗡嗡地喧鬧著，以一種奇特的音色綿軟的語言與時間抗爭，沒有目的，沒有對手，自我遊戲帶來自我滿足，這種無所企望的茶館腔調後來也被我挪用為小說行進中的敘述節奏。
可是比虛構更具戲劇性的是事物本身，就是前面所說的這家茶館，就好像是一些不負責任的小說和電影處理一個重要場景一樣，茶館最後付之一炬。一九九○年春天，也就是在我寫《南方的墮落》前的幾個月前，那家茶館非常突然而無法補救地失火倒塌了。我回到家鄉的時候看見的是一片廢墟。我在茶館的廢墟上停留的時候感覺到某種失落，可是我的失落不是針對一座茶館的消亡，而是源自一個寫作藍本的突然死亡，我的哀悼與其說是一人對一物的哀悼，不如說是一個寫作者對一個象徵一個意象的哀悼。
如果說那座茶館是南方，這個南方無疑是一個易燃品，它如此脆弱，它的消失比我的生命還要消失得匆忙，讓人無法信賴。我懷疑我的南方到底是什麼？南方到底在什麼地方？
我對我經常描述的一條南方小街的了解到底有多深呢？我對它的固執的回憶是否能夠隨著時間的流逝觸及南方的真實部分呢？
我的頭腦中現在一一閃現的仍然是前面那條小街的景物。很抱歉我要說小街上的另一個公共廁所。這個廁所的歷史非常短促，我記得小時候它不存在，它所在的位置原先應該是一塊空地，空地後面的人家長年地在那裡種一些小蔥和雞冠花之類的東西。有一年廁所出現了。一個簡陋的南方常見的街頭公共廁所，但是修建得十分匆忙，裡面的水泥地面甚至都沒有抹平便投入使用了，這個廁所對附近的居民充滿了善意，只是無人管理，因此很髒也很臭。這是一個特殊的有著某種危險的廁所，因為它面對著附近的一個居民小區，從小區的高樓上可以清晰地看見如廁人的面貌甚至如廁的姿勢，所以對於使用廁所的人和小區高樓陽臺上的居民來說，廁所造成了雙重的尷尬。
而我作為一個寫作者，當我在住所的陽臺上眺望小街風景時，我怎麼也無法忽略廁所的存在，我的目光注定是不平靜的，一種曖昧不潔的觀察導致了一種更加難以表述的厭惡感和敵意。這厭惡感和敵意不僅僅是生理上的，也因為那間廁所造成了我忠實記錄小街風情的一大障礙。所幸的是這廁所也一樣不能逃脫它滅亡的命運，不同於茶館的焚毀，這間不必要存在的廁所後來被人填平了，填平以後又在原址上蓋了一間房子，後來我發現有一對年輕的夫婦住在那房子裡，有時候我從那裡經過的時候，從窗戶看見那對夫婦坐在裡面看電視。我感到很高興，這幾乎是小街多少年來最大的一次改變了，這改變的意義對於我來說是特殊的，我走過那裡的時候回想這塊空地多少年來的變化，突然發現了類似波赫士的〈南方〉中的三角支撐：小蔥雞冠花、公共廁所、年輕夫婦的家，這是一個關於小街回憶的三角支撐，由此我依稀發現了我所需要的南方的故事。
可是這是南方嗎？我同樣地表示懷疑。我所尋求的南方也許是一個空洞而幽暗的所在，也許它只是一個文學的主題，多少年來南方屹立在南方，南方的居民安居在南方，唯有南方的主題在時間之中漂浮不定，書寫南方的努力有時酷似求證虛無，因此一個神祕的傳奇的南方更多地是存在於文字之中，它也許不在南方。
我現在仍然無數次地走過那條小街，好多年過去以後我對這條小街充滿了敬畏之情，這是一隻飛雁對樹林的敬畏，飛雁不是樹林的主人，就像大家所說的南方，誰是南方的主人？當我穿越過這條小街的時候我覺得疲憊，我留戀回憶，我忍不住地以回憶觸摸南方，但我看見的是一個破舊而牢固的世界，這很像《追憶逝水年華》中蓋爾芒特最後一次在貢布雷地區的漫步，「在明亮的燈光下世界是多麼廣闊，可是在回憶的眼光中世界又是多麼的狹小！」而一個作者迷失在南方的經驗又多麼像普魯斯特迷失在永恆與時間的主題中。
瓦爾特．班雅明說得好：「我們沒有一個人有時間去經歷命中注定要經歷的真正的生活戲劇。正是這一緣故使我們衰老。我們臉上的皺紋就是激情、惡習和召喚我們的洞察力留下的痕跡。但是我們，這些主人，卻無家可歸。」
是的，我和我的寫作皆以南方為家，但我常常覺得我無家可歸。

""Chinese prose for a hundred years. Mainland China Volume 2: Su Tong <What is the South?
02 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is yes, both me and my writing are home to the South, but I often feel that I am homeless.



Text: Su Tong
What is the South (2009)
One afternoon many years ago, I looked at a narrow, dilapidated street in the sight of a three-story building in a matchbox. This is one of the most familiar streets in the poor street, and it has been the municipal construction for many years. A small street forgotten—a small street without construction, one leading to a stone arch bridge built during the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, and the other leading to the farmland and sunbathing field of a certain group in the suburbs (six, seven ○ ○), or the new ring road and a new factory area mixed with state-owned enterprise village enterprises (80s). When I looked at the small street in the afternoon sun, I suddenly remembered how I went there to eat lunch at the factory cafeteria where my mother was. I remember the public toilet under the bridge. The small street from this head to the big one. Most housewives and children of my age, I remember that they were at lunch in front of the table in the sight of passers-by.
I am lamented that many years have passed, the public toilets are still there, the gravel road is covered with cement, but the road surface is still so narrow and wet, people still enjoy the convenience brought by the narrow, it is very easy to dry clothes The bamboo truss is on the roof of the neighboring house. Walking and cyclists are still walking under the sheets, wool, suits, trousers and even underwear. This is the street scene of the street I am most familiar with. The visual impression of disorder is unclear. The breath of living life. Some old people must have died, most of them are still alive, and most people raise children and even children and children in small streets. The daily life of Xiaojie is still the same, just like an old-fashioned wall clock, it digests a vigorous era, digests the time on the calendar and the events in the news reports. Its pendulum moves slowly, but calmly, This pendulum corrects some kind of prejudice in my mind that pursues speed and change: slowness does not mean that time is not allowed, it does not change, and does not mean death.
That afternoon I suddenly heard the survival confession of a southern street. This confession was simple and vivid. Because of the secular and profound, I was impressed by its inexplicable power:
I have never been so affectionate about the birth of the camphor tree street, sing a pale, uninspired stone pavement, sing the two rows of old and ugly old-fashioned houses without beginnings and ends, singing the flies on the streets and flying with mold. The air sings out the intricate neighbors who are in the window of the black hole. I grew up in the south. It is like a grass seed held by a flying geese. I can't help but grasp it. But I hate the life in the south for a long time. This is the eternal imprint left by the camphor tree.
This is the beginning of a novella ""The Fall of the South"" that I wrote that summer. Now I should explain it, but I found that I got myself into trouble. I found a hostility in my writing that targets a fictional or real-life place: the South. What is the South? What does the South represent? What does the hostility that I have revealed to the South mean?
Perhaps first comes from the hostility towards the memories themselves. Before recollection, people usually stipulate an emotional stance for their memories, a beautiful bruise of whitewashing, or a calm and objective attempt to reproduce history, and I just chose a cold and almost like revenge. . This is a paranoid and unexplained hostility. My so-called southern life comes only from the mechanical delineation of the relationship between my personal life and a certain place. My South is a street in the sixties and seventies that I remembered in my memory, and I was a child. A child’s understanding of the world around him is vague and uncertain. If people’s hostility towards things comes from the potential or obvious harm to you, I can’t accurately describe the details of the damage. I suspect that this hostility may be unreasonable.
All the descriptions by means of memories are not reliable, so they are not trustworthy. Just like a primary school teacher I mentioned in an article, I always think that my memory is very deep. I thought I was restoring a past. The character, but even her birthplace and family background were later proved by my other elementary school teachers to be a testimony. The only accurate one is my description of her appearance. A fact sometimes makes you panic. Reliable things exist in reality, but they don't exist in memories. So I have to doubt my hostility. This hostility is actually not reliable. I also have to doubt my South. Where is it? Have I ever had a hometown in the South?
The Argentine writer Bohshi, whom everyone admires, happens to have a wonderful short story called ""Southern."" ""Everyone knows that the side of Rivadavia is the beginning of the South."" In this novel, the South extends its meaning from a place name, and the sinister hero Dalman and his hand One Thousand and One Nights and the South form a powerful triangular relationship that supports all the thought spaces that the authors want to express. Darman came to the south, ""One Thousand and One Nights"" has never been able to cover up the cruel and cold reality. In the grocery store, someone throws a small ball into the sick Darman, so the world is the least suitable for a duel. The man had to accept an icy dagger.
The meaning of the South may be a symbolic representation of the situation here.
Where is my South? How much do I know about the South?
At the northern end of the street where I grew up, there is a tea house. The tea house is on the side of the river, on one side of the bridge, and on the side of the street. It is an old two-storey wooden building. For a long time, I was like a film that was good at framing. The director set it as a symbol of the so-called South. I tried to remember the people there. The old woman who burned the stove was an old woman. Later, the old woman was too old to work. She came to a new operator, a woman, a lot of young, two generations of women holding shovel. The expressions when adding 砻糠 to the stove are strikingly similar. They frown, and there is always a complaint in their mouths. It seems to blame life. It seems to enjoy life. The expression of their labor is the southern woman I later described. The basis of the expression.
The more important reference objects are those who sit and talk. Those who drink tea in cheap Yixing pottery at the greasy Eight Immortals table have been prescribed by me as the most typical southern residents. They are laid-back, trivial, rap, They got together, they are very interested in politics and national affairs, but they can’t talk about it. They talk about food and dishes inadvertently, but they show their unique personal taste and profound knowledge. They sit there and are within one kilometer away from home. Local adventures, indulging themselves, they are screaming, fighting with time in a strange sound and soft language, no purpose, no opponents, self-satisfaction brings self-satisfaction, this unpredictable teahouse accent is also me Appropriation is the narrative rhythm of the novel's progress.
But what is more dramatic than fiction is the thing itself. It is the tea house mentioned above. It is like an irresponsible novel and film processing an important scene. In the spring of 1990, a few months before I wrote The Fall of the South, the teahouse was suddenly and unrecoverable and the fire collapsed. When I returned home, I saw a ruin. I felt some loss when I stayed on the ruins of the teahouse, but my loss was not directed at the demise of a tea house, but from the sudden death of a blueprint. My mourning is not so much a mourning for one thing. It is better to say that a writer is mourning a symbol of an image.
If the teahouse is south, this south is undoubtedly a flammable product. It is so fragile that its disappearance is more hurried than my life, making people untrustworthy. I doubt what is my South? Where is the South?
How deep is my understanding of a southern street I often describe? Can my stubborn memories of it touch the real part of the South as time goes by?
What is flashing in my mind is still the scene of the small street in front. I am sorry that I have to say another public toilet on the small street. The history of this toilet is very short. I remember that it didn't exist when I was young. It was originally located in an open space. The parents behind the open space planted some onions and cockscombs. One year the toilet appeared. A simple street public toilet in the south, but it was built in a hurry. The concrete floor inside was not even put into use. The toilet was full of goodwill to the nearby residents, but it was unmanned, so it was dirty and smelly. . This is a special kind of toilet with some kind of danger, because it faces a nearby residential area. From the high-rise building of the community, you can clearly see the face of the toilet person and even the posture of the toilet. For the residents on the balcony of the high-rise building, the toilet caused a double embarrassment.
As a writer, when I look at the scenery of the small street on the balcony of my residence, I can't ignore the existence of the toilet. My eyes are destined to be unsettled. A kind of unclean observation leads to a more difficult expression. Disgust and hostility. This disgust and hostility is not only physical, but also because the toilet has created a major obstacle to my faithful record of the street style. Fortunately, this toilet can't escape the fate of its demise. Unlike the burning of teahouses, this unnecessary toilet was later filled in. After filling it, it built a house on the original site. Later I found out that there was one. The young couple lived in the house, and sometimes when I passed by, I saw the couple sitting in the window watching TV. I am very happy. This is almost the biggest change in the small street for many years. The meaning of this change is special for me. When I walked there, I recalled the changes in this open space for many years and suddenly found a similar wave. The triangular support in Hex's ""South"": the onion cockscomb, the public toilet, the home of the young couple, this is a triangular support for the memories of the small street, so I vaguely found the story of the South I need.
But is this the South? I also expressed doubts. The south I am looking for may be a hollow and dark place. Maybe it is just a literary theme. For many years, the south stood in the south, and the southern residents lived in the south. Only the southern theme floated in time, writing the south. Efforts sometimes seem to prove nothingness, so a mysterious legendary South is more in the text, and it may not be in the South.
I still walked through that small street many times. After many years, I was full of awe in this small street. This is a flying geese who is not the owner of the woods. Said the South, who is the master of the South? When I crossed this street, I felt tired. I missed memories. I couldn’t help but touch the South with memories, but I saw a dilapidated and solid world, which is very similar to the cover of Reminiscence. For the last time in the Gombray area, ""What is the world in the bright light, but how narrow the world is in the eyes of memories!"" And how the experience of an author lost in the South is like Plu Ster is lost in the theme of eternity and time.
Walter. Ban Yaming said well: ""We don't have a single person who has time to experience the real life drama that is destined to go through. It is this reason that makes us aging. The wrinkles on our faces are passion, vices and summoning our insights. Traces. But we, these masters, are homeless.""
Yes, both me and my writing are home to the South, but I often feel that I am homeless.

Editor: Chen Dawei, Zhong Yiwen
In 1918, Lu Xun published ""The Madman's Diary"", officially unveiling the prelude of modern Chinese literature and even modern Chinese writing in the world. It has been a hundred years. In 2008, in order to welcome the founding of Jiu Ge Publishing House for 40 years, the ""100 Years of Chinese Literature"" edited by Chen Dawei and Zhong Yiwen was launched. This is a set of 100-year-old collections covering the four most developed Chinese literature sections: Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and MCA. The selection of the book is diversified, including the rewriting of the classics of modern literary history, the famous masterpieces, the pioneering works of various generations, and the alternatives that are ignored by the mainstream vision. The ""Hundred Years of Chinese Literature"" is included in the concept of chronicles, and according to the order of publication, the most representative works of the year are selected. At the end of each article, the author's streamlined biography is attached.
""Chinese prose for a hundred years. The Chinese Mainland Volume is divided into two volumes, which contain a total of fifty-five Chinese essayist works. Intensive reading can follow the great context of the history of prose, and observe the ups and downs of its theme and trend of thought. If you read it, you can also enjoy the masterpieces of all generations and the scenery of the times. Since the selection of this volume in the 1990s, prose has flourished during these 30 years, and it has formed a wave of sweeping across the country.
