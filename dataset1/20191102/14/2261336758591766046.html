      <p>Since his early years in the UFC, Nate Diaz has been a fan-favorite. But the fight that catapulted him into mainstream superstardom is his UFC 196 headliner against Conor McGregor in March 2016.</p>

      <p>Diaz stepped in as a last-minute replacement for Rafael dos Anjos, whom “The Notorious” was challenging for the lightweight title at the time. But being fresh off a vacation in Mexico with almost no training, the Stockton native took the fight at 170 pounds.</p>
      <p>The two men fought for nearly two rounds, but it was Diaz who walked off with the rear-naked choke submission. The magnitude of the said fight led to a rematch five months later at UFC 202, which turned out to be one of the biggest cards in company history.</p>
      <p>During the fight week festivities for UFC 244, Diaz rewatched his first encounter with McGregor, while providing some colorful commentary on.</p>
      <p>“Dana White’s crying. ‘Nooo!’” he said with a laugh in reaction right after referee Herb Dean stopped the fight. “‘That’s my guy!’”</p>
      <p>Diaz will headline his third pay-per-view event this weekend against Jorge Masvidal at UFC 244. The winner of the fight will take home the first-ever UFC “baddest motherf—r” title belt.</p>
