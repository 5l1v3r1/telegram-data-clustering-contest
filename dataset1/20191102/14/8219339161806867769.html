      <p>Apple TV+ officially <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/01/apple-tv-plus-tv-shows-movies-guide/">debuted to the public yesterday</a>, but Apple has been teasing and promoting the launch since March. New data from iSpot.TV, first reported by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/business/media/apple-tv-plus-streaming-wars.html"><i>The New York Times</i></a>, sheds light on how much Apple is spending on marketing for TV+. The report explains that Apple is taking a ‘slow-roll’ approach to advertising the service.</p>
      <p>According to the data, Apple spent $19.9 million television commercials for TV+ during the month of October. In comparison, Apple spent $28.6 million on television ads for the iPhone during the month.</p>
      <p>In terms of online marketing, there were 139 unique digital ads for Apple TV+ in October, which cost the company $1.7 million. For the iPhone, Apple spent $2.3 million on 245 separate unique ads, according to data from advertising analytics platform Pathmatics.</p>
      <p>In September, however, the story was reversed. Apple spent $3.8 million on TV+ digital advertisements compared to $2.4 million on digital iPhone ads.</p>
      <p>In total, Apple spent $71.9 million on iPhone advertising through September and October, and $40.3 million on TV+ advertising during the same period. Of note, that data only includes television and online ads because billboard and outdoor advertising data was not available.</p>
      <p><i>The New York Times</i> notes that in comparison to Disney+, the Apple’s marketing blitz for TV+ has been “more muted.” This could be purposeful, as Apple TV+ debuted with a considerably smaller lineup of content than Disney+ will.</p>
      <blockquote>“Consumers are just drowning in content right now, and all of these services are competing for our time,” Dan Rayburn, an analyst with Frost &amp; Sullivan said. “But they’re all approaching the market differently. This isn’t some race for Apple. It’s a slow roll.”</blockquote>
      <p>Meanwhile, Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said that Apple will need to be aggressive in marketing TV+ throughout the holidays, and into next year when it attempts to convert trial customers to paying customers:</p>
      <blockquote>“This is a pivotal juncture for Apple to be successful — they cannot trip over their shoelace,” Mr. Ives said. “They were late to the game, they’ve underinvested in content and they have a lot of room to make up.”</blockquote>
      <p>Apple TV+ debuted on Friday. You can read our <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/01/apple-tv-plus-tv-shows-movies-guide/">full coverage here</a>.</p>
