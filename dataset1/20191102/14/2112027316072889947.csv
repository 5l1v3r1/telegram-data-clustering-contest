Preview: Predator: Hunting Grounds is the first intriguing Predator game
02 Nov 2019, 14:31 by Lewis White

After over a decade of AVP titles, the almighty Predator finally gets another stab at a standalone game in Predator: Hunting Grounds, a faithful asymmetrical multiplayer take on the iconic monster.

After our journeys through the worlds of Cyberpunk 2077 and Doom Eternal, our eyes were instantly glued to one of the most intriguing titles available at EGX 2019. Published as an exclusive title for Sony’s PlayStation 4, players are tasked with taking the role of either the hunted hard-bodied marines or the titular Predator. Obviously, I chose the latter.
For those who choose to embody the alien body of film’s greatest hunter, Hunting Grounds plays in a third-person perspective. The Predator starts before the enemy marines spawn: as the hunter you’re given a chance to set the stage, glare over the map and get ready for your prey to arrive. It won’t take long for the hunter’s game to pour into the hunting ground.



The marines’ view is completely different: switching from third-to-first person, playing as a generic foot soldier feels appropriately, well, generic. Just like in the original 1988 film, the four-player group of gun-toting badasses aren’t exactly there to fight the Predator. Instead, the group of soldiers have numerous goals to complete against the native enemy army.
Just like in the films, you have access to different views to help track your targets through the thick forests with thermal vision being the most useful.
None of the marine objectives appear particularly inventive: while our squad of four didn’t last longer than fifteen minutes against the hulking force of the mighty Predator, a few objectives did get completed. They felt bog-standard: hack a computer, restart a generator or capture an enemy base. Marine gameplay is rather run-of-the-mill, but moment-to-moment gunplay is satisfying enough.
Thankfully, our time controlling the Predator was more inventive despite some rocky unfinished issues. As the marines began moving from objective to objective, the blood-hungry alien is tasked with scouring for targets from above. Just like in the films, you have access to different views to help track your targets through the thick forests with thermal vision being the most useful.



You’re also given access to a decent selection of iconic predator gadgets. While we’re told that more will be available to use in the final game. We were given access to just a few: the shoulder-mounted laser gun, the awesome claws and a shutiken. With the ability to sprint up trees and leap across branches (Naruto-style) and heal wounds, Hunting Grounds does make you feel like the iconic beast.



If Predator: Hunting Grounds ends up having some more interesting in-game missions by the time launch comes, we could have a genuinely good standalone Predator game.

Rio de Janeiro

Owner of the suspected oil spill that hits the beaches of the Northeast, Greek company Delta Tankers said on Saturday (2) that inspection on oil tanker Bouboulina found no evidence of oil spill from the vessel.
The Bouboulina ship was singled out by police and Federal Prosecutor investigations as responsible for the spill while passing across the Northeast coast with a Venezuelan oil cargo bound for Malaysia.
""There is no evidence that the ship has stopped, conducted any type of STS [oil-to-ship transfer] operation, has spilled / leaked oil, slowed or diverted its route during the voyage,"" said Delta, which reaffirms that it has not yet sought by Brazilian authorities.
In the note, the company says the inspection included researching camera and sensor information that ships carry, vessel activity, course changes, stops, and navigational speed, among others.


Boubolina, oil tanker operated by Greek company is suspected of spilling oil reaching the Northeast, according to PF-Disclosure / Delta Tankers

""The material will be willingly shared with the Brazilian authorities as soon as they contact the company about the investigation. So far, no contact has been made,"" the company said.
On Friday (1), the Federal Police fulfilled search and seizure warrants in service providers to Delta in Brazil, seeking information about the ship. The targets were Lachman Maritime Agency and Witt O Brien's, which denied ties to Delta Tankers.
Lachman represents the company in Brazil, and Witt O Brien's makes recommendations and plans for it in the event of a disaster at sea.
The investigations concluded that the oil spill occurred at the end of July and, based on simulations and satellite imagery, retrospectively reached a point of origin.

At the same time, a private geo-intelligence company indicated an oil slick on July 29, 733 km east of Paraiba (the first state to record the stains) and debris moving toward the Brazilian coast.
From this initial area, the Navy reached a number of 30 suspects. Bouboulina was in the spot area of the spot at that time transporting crude oil from Venezuela's San José oil loading terminal.
According to authorities, the vessel's tracking system confirms the passage through the point of origin of the oil on the voyage between Venezuela and South Africa and Nigeria - information questioned by Delta in Saturday's note.
On Friday, attorneys Cibele Benevides and Victor Mariz say there is strong evidence that the company, the ship's captain and crew have failed to communicate to the appropriate authorities about the release or release of crude oil into the Atlantic Ocean.
""Delta Tankers operates with stringent environmental policies in accordance with international regulations and cameras and sensors on all ships are part of these policies,"" the Greek company said in a statement issued on Saturday.
The latest update from Ibama, released Thursday (31), indicates that 296 locations in 101 cities in all states of the Northeast were hit by oil slicks.
