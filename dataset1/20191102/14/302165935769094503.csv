Its president, Rizani Zakaria said the seizures of vape products worth millions of ringgit nationwide,  by the Health Ministry recently, is affecting the business of vape industry players.
“We are aware of the enforcement action taken by the ministry and want  the vape traders to cooperate with the authorities.
