      <h1>In election pitch, UK PM Johnson backs his deal over no-deal Brexit</h1>
      <h2>Johnson had previously pledged to take Britain out of the European Union with or without a deal on Oct</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T14:52:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 14:52</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has put his <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/brexit">Brexit </a>withdrawal deal at the centre of his election campaign, rejecting an electoral pact with the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/brexit">Brexit </a>Party that would mean he would have to embrace leaving the European Union without a deal.</p>
      <p>Johnson had previously pledged to take Britain out of the European Union with or without a deal on Oct. 31, before lawmakers voted to force him to seek an extension until Jan. 31.</p>
      <p>But he has abandoned the threat of a no-deal <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/brexit">Brexit </a>in his Conservative Party’s manifesto for the Dec. 12 election, the Times newspaper reported on Saturday. It added that the focus would be on getting his <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/brexit-deal">Brexit deal </a>approved.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Johnson rejected a call from the Brexit Party to drop the deal he negotiated with the European Union last month in order to form a new electoral pact, saying that he could put his deal through parliament after any election win. [nL9N26806J]</p>
      <p>“What we’ve got is a fantastic deal that nobody thought we could get,” Johnson said. “As soon as we get back in the middle of December, we can put that deal through.”</p>
      <p>Nicky Morgan, the culture minister who is standing down as a lawmaker, said a vote for the Conservatives would be a vote against no deal.</p>
      <p>“If you vote Conservative at this election, you’re voting to leave with this deal, and no-deal has been effectively been taken off the table,” she told the Times in an interview.</p>
      <p>In Britain’s tortuous road since a 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU, businesses and economists have cautioned that leaving the bloc without a deal to smooth the transition would deliver a big blow to the British economy.</p>
      <p>Proponents of a no-deal Brexit say it provides a clean break from EU rules and regulations.</p>
      <p>The Conservative manifesto will also not include a commitment to a fiscal rule, the Times reported, relaxing the government’s grip on public finances. The Conservative party did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>The government’s previous fiscal rule pledged to hold the underlying budget deficit below 2% of the country’s economic output in the 2020/21 financial year.</p>
      <p>Opinion polls give Johnson a sizeable lead over the main opposition Labour Party, but also suggest that more than 10% of voters back the Brexit Party - enough to split the pro-Brexit vote in some seats and hand victory to Labour.</p>
