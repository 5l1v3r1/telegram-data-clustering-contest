Opposition won’t settle for anything less than PM’s resignation
02 Nov 2019, 14:00 by ​ Our Correspondent



ISLAMABAD.: Declaring that the opposition would not settle for anything less than the ouster of Prime Minister Imran Khan, the Rahbar Committee on Saturday said they were considering other options, including en bloc resignation from parliament and a countrywide strike call in case the government did not meet their demand.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad on Saturday, JUI-F leader Akram Durrani flanked by other members of the committee said they had signed an agreement with the Islamabad deputy commissioner for the march and they would stand by it.
“Besides resignations from parliament and strike, blocking highways, and locking down the whole country at district level and all other options necessary for any movement are also being considered,” said Durrani.
Durrani insisted that the principal demand of the opposition was the “resignation of Prime Minister Imran Khan”.
He said there would be no talks with the government if their foremost demand was not met, adding that the tone of the prime minister and his negotiating team head was not good.



“We don’t refuse to engage in talks but the government’s attitude is not appropriate,” he said, adding that “any irresponsible action by non-democratic forces” would be against national interest. All opposition parties are unanimous on this point and oppose it.”
Speaking on the occasion, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Secretary General Ahsan Iqbal said he was shocked to know that Prime Minister Imran had waived the mandatory requirement of passport for the visiting Sikh pilgrims from
India.
“We welcome the Sikh pilgrims, who are set to visit the country for Baba Guru
Nanak’s 550th birth anniversary next week, but how an Indian citizen could enter the Pakistani territory without the basic document … it means you are changing the status of that territory,” he added. “This government has turned Pakistan into a laughing stock with blunders such as this.”

NCCRI is unable to control blocking by providers of Russian social networks, sites and TV channels
Today, neither the SBU, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, nor the National Security and Defense Council can carry out audits of telecommunication operators.

According to the employees of the Ukrainian special services, the exact number of physical (wired) communication lines between Ukraine and Russia is still unknown. In the late 1990s - early 2000s, when the Internet was booming and relations between the two countries were considered ""friendly"", Internet service providers from both countries practically uncontrolled the cables between the Ukrainian and Russian borders. As a result, the Ukrainian special services and other specialized agencies are unaware of the physical infrastructure that supplies a toxic information stream to Ukraine from Russia.
About it in the article for DT.UA write Vladimir Kravchenko and Tatiana Silina. According to them, significant difficulties for the work of the national regulator - the National Commission for State Regulation in the Field of Communication and Informatization (NCCRI) - is a huge number of telecommunication operators (about 6.5 thousand), registered mostly as FOP, LLC, PJSC.
""After the NCCRI was deprived of its control functions, the regulator was essentially helpless to violations by the operators, including in cases where they did not block Russian social networks, sites and TV channels that were on the Ukrainian sanctions list,"" observers said.
They indicate that now neither the SBU, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, nor the National Security and Defense Council can carry out audits of telecommunication operators, and NCCRI has the right to check the activity of an operator only if a complaint about his work is received from a specific citizen. In the conditions of aggressive and generously funded information war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, such helplessness of the Ukrainian regulator poses a threat to the information security of Ukraine.
