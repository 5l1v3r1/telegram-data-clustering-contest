      <h1>The Aston Villa prediction that Liverpool fans will hate but Manchester United fans will love</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa preview | Dean Smith’s men welcome the current Premier League leaders to Villa Park this afternoon (3pm) and have been backed to pick up all three points</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T14:10:15+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 14:10</time> by <a rel="author">Jonny Bonell</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa legend Paul McGrath is backing his former club to end Liverpool’s long unbeaten run this afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Reds head to Villa Park with nine wins from their opening 10 Premier League games and six points ahead of nearest challengers Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Villa, on the back of a 3-0 loss away to the Citizens in their last League outing, are going in search of a third win from four top-flight games.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And McGrath, who played for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> between 1989 and 1996, believes his old side can follow up Wednesday’s Carabao Cup victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers by beating the European champions.</p>
      <p>He tweeted ahead of the game: “Aston Villa Fc v Liverpool Fc. Great test to see how good Liverpool are.</p>
      <p>“Coming up against a brilliant defence, smashing midfield, and goal getters. Aston Villa win. #Relax#Enjoy#Result #UTV.”</p>
      <p>McGrath's prediction will also please fans of his former club, Manchester United, another place where he is still deemed a legend.</p>
