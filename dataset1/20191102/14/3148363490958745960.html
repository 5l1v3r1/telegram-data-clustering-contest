      <h1>Jim Carrey Promotes Impeachment Drawing of 'Pelosi' Crushing Trump's Testicles</h1>
      <h2>Actor Jim Carrey released his latest and perhaps most gruesome political drawing late Friday, featuring House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) banging a gavel down on President Donald Trump’s genitals.</h2>

      <p>“This is a cartoon I call ‘Welcome to Nancy’s Wheelhouse.’ It’s intended for mature audiences,” Jim Carrey said in a tweet promoting the graphic piece.</p>

      <p>The <i>Dumb and Dumber </i>star’s drawing was his first public reaction to the House <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/31/house-democrats-passes-partisan-impeachment-process-resolution/">passing</a> H. Res. 660 this week on a partisan vote of 232-196. The bill allows Pelosi and Democrats to formally establish the rules regarding the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Trump.</p>

      <p>It was just a few weeks ago when Carrey unleashed a politically charged drawing urging Pelosi to begin impeachment hearings to oust the “animal” Trump.</p>
      <p>“Hey, Nancy Pelosi: There’s something on the wing! Some THING! You may wanna grit your teeth and cross your fingers while this gremlin rips the engines apart — but the rest of us want to live.” Jim Carrey captioned his drawing, which saw a ghastly looking Pelosi on an airplane, with the wing being destroyed by Trump.</p>
      <p>The <i>Sonic the Hedgehog </i>stars previous political drawings have included the <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/03/28/jim-carrey-fantasizes-gory-death-eric-donald-trump-jr/">brutal deaths</a> of President Trump’s sons Don Jr. and Eric at the hands of an elephant and his wife Melania being <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/06/03/jim-carrey-art-depicts-mindless-melania-trump-being-brainwashed/">electrocuted</a>. Jim Carrey says the graphic drawings are his way of dealing with the “pain” inflicted by the current administration.</p>
