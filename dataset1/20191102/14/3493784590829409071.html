        <h3>DRIVING THE DAY</h3>
        <p><b>ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST … “Beto O'Rourke drops out of 2020 race,” </b>by David Siders: “Beto O’Rourke abandoned his flagging presidential campaign Friday, writing that it is ‘clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully.’ The former Texas congressman had been lagging for months in single digits in public opinion polls and was at risk of not qualifying for the November debate.</p>
        <p><b>“‘Our campaign has been about seeing clearly,</b> speaking honestly and acting decisively in the best interests of America,’ O’Rourke wrote on Medium. ‘Though it is difficult to accept, it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully.’” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/01/orourke-drops-out-of-2020-race-064032"><u>POLITICO</u></a></p>
        <p><b>-- “The End of Betomania,” </b>by NYT’s Matt Flegenheimer in Des Moines: “Officially, the end came Friday evening, among teary supporters and stern-faced staff, at the bottom of a damp riverside hill. He spoke across from the arena where the remaining 2020 Democratic contenders would be addressing the crowd at a rah-rah candidate dinner, their teams’ cheers already audible from the street above as they filed in.</p>
        <p><b>“‘We’re all a little crazy to be doing this,’ Mr. O’Rourke told one supporter </b>quietly, consoling all comers after giving some valedictory public remarks about staying in the fight. ‘In a good way.’ One by one, they approached to thank him, to hug him, to take one more picture — a grim political processional in the year of the merry candidate photo line, completed after dusk in front of six giant wooden letters, painted blue to read ‘NO FEAR.’” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/02/us/politics/beto-orourke.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage"><u>NYT</u></a></p>
        <p><b>THE STATE OF PLAY </b>via <b>WAPO’S MATT VISER </b>and <b>JENNA JOHNSON: </b>“In one of the most hyper-charged political rises and dramatic collapses in recent times, O’Rourke on Friday evening became the highest-profile candidate to drop out of the 2020 presidential campaign, amid financial strains and lagging popularity. His abrupt exit capped a week in which Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) significantly curbed her own ambitions, laying off most of her New Hampshire staff and reorienting her campaign toward Iowa. In the same week, a super PAC set up to benefit Joe Biden began operating, a reflection of his struggle to gain ground in Iowa even as he maintains a position at the top of what is now a 16-candidate field.</p>
        <p><b>“O’Rourke’s departure demonstrated the winnowing </b>of what began as a historically large and diverse presidential field and now is largely controlled by four candidates, all of them white, most of them in their 70s, and two of them far to the left ideologically. His decision, coupled with Biden’s and Harris’s difficulties, leaves establishment moderates worried about the shape of the race three months before the Iowa caucuses.” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/beto-orourke-quits-presidential-race-amid-financial-strains-and-lagging-popularity/2019/11/01/e25c380c-fcee-11e9-8190-6be4deb56e01_story.html"><u>WaPo</u></a></p>
        <p><b>THE TWITTER PRESIDENCY … “In Trump’s Twitter Feed: Conspiracy-Mongers, Racists and Spies,”</b> by NYT’s Mike McIntire, Karen Yourish and Larry Buchanan: “By retweeting suspect accounts, seemingly without regard for their identity or motives, [President Donald Trump] has lent credibility to white nationalists, anti-Muslim bigots and obscure QAnon adherents like VB Nationalist, an anonymous account that has promoted a hoax about top Democrats worshiping the Devil and engaging in child sex trafficking.</p>
        <p><b>“To assess this unprecedented moment,</b> The New York Times examined Mr. Trump’s interactions with Twitter since he took office, reviewing each of his more than 11,000 tweets and the hundreds of accounts he has retweeted, tracking the ways he is exposed to information and replicating what he is likely to see on the platform. The result, including new data analysis and previously unreported details, offers the most comprehensive view yet of a virtual world in which the president spends significant time mingling with extremists, impostors and spies.</p>
        <p><b>“Fake accounts tied to intelligence services in China,</b> Iran and Russia had directed thousands of tweets at Mr. Trump, according to a Times analysis of propaganda accounts suspended by Twitter. Iranian operatives tweeted anti-Semitic tropes, saying that Mr. Trump was ‘being controlled’ by global Zionists, and that pulling out of the Iran nuclear treaty would benefit North Korea. Russian accounts tagged the president more than 30,000 times, including in supportive tweets about the Mexican border wall and his hectoring of black football players. Mr. Trump even retweeted a phony Russian account that said, ‘We love you, Mr. President!’” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/02/us/politics/trump-twitter-disinformation.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage"><u>NYT</u></a> … <b><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/02/us/politics/trump-twitter-presidency.html"><i>Interactive</i></a></b></p>
        <p><b>ABOUT LAST NIGHT … TRUMP’S NEW 2020 BATTLE CRY: “Trump to Mississippi rally crowd: Impeachment is an affront to you,” </b>by Matthew Choi: “To President Donald Trump, the House's vote on impeachment wasn't just an affront to him, but to the millions of Americans who voted for him. ‘Yesterday’s vote by the radical Democrats is an attack on democracy itself,’ Trump said during a Friday night rally in Tupelo, Mississippi.</p>
        <p><b>“Trump's remark follows the House voting Thursday </b>largely along party lines to set the ground rules for an impeachment inquiry. The vote was a litmus test for the impeachment process, with moderate Democrats who had been tepid on diving into impeachment voicing their near-unanimous support.</p>
        <p><b>“In Mississippi, Trump framed the probe</b> — sparked by the president's request for Ukrainian officials to investigate a domestic political rival — as an attack on his supporters in the rally audience. He reprised the dismissive language he'd employed during former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the 2016 election, calling the impeachment probe a ‘witch hunt.’” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/01/trump-impeachment-rally-mississippi-064285"><u>POLITICO</u></a></p>
        <p><b>HMM … “Trump, DHS differ on who is acting DHS secretary,” </b>by Ian Kullgren, Anita Kumar, and Daniel Lippman: “President Donald Trump said this evening that Homeland Security official Chad Wolf is now acting DHS secretary — and an agency spokesperson promptly replied that he is not. Trump told reporters before leaving for a campaign rally in Mississippi that Wolf had replaced acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan, whose last day in the job was supposed to be Thursday. McAleenan had planned to extend his stay until Nov. 7, but Trump said Wolf was acting secretary already.</p>
        <p><b>“‘He’s right now acting and we’ll see what happens,’</b> Trump said. ‘We have great people in there.’ But DHS disputed that in a written statement several minutes later, saying that McAleenan is still in charge. ‘McAleenan is the acting secretary,’ the spokesperson said in a statement to the press pool. ‘Wolf is the acting undersecretary for policy.’</p>
        <p><b>“Trump called Wolf a few days ago </b>and told him to expect to be appointed, a person familiar with the plan told POLITICO on Thursday. Two other officials said that the White House has been speaking to reluctant GOP senators — including Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) — and asking them not to oppose Wolf’s appointment to be undersecretary of the department.” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/01/trump-wolf-is-acting-dhs-secretary-064213"><u>POLITICO</u></a></p>
        <p><b>Good Saturday morning. </b>Thousands of Nats fans are expected to descend on the National Mall this afternoon for the parade to celebrate the Nationals’ World Series victory. The parade will start at 2 p.m. near the Washington Monument and last about two hours traveling to Pennsylvania Avenue and Third Street N.W.</p>
        <p><b>-- SPOTTED FRIDAY NIGHT: </b>Members of the Washington Nationals -- including GM Mike Rizzo, Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg, Aníbal Sánchez, Ryan Zimmerman, Daniel Hudson and Sean Doolittle -- celebrating their World Series win at Cafe Milano. … Juan Soto at Fish by Jose Andrés at MGM National Harbor.</p>
        <p><b>-- MEANWHILE … WAPO’S JOSH DAWSEY </b>unpacks how the RNC paid for Trump’s luxury box at the World Series game, leaving lawmakers with the sticky problem of who and how much to reimburse for the ticket. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rnc-pays-face-value-for-trump-partys-luxury-seats-at-world-series-game/2019/11/01/db3c5cf4-fc09-11e9-9534-e0dbcc9f5683_story.html"><u>WaPo</u></a> … <b>AND NOT EVERY NATS </b>player is planning on going to the White House Monday.

        <p><b>ABOUT THAT WALL … “Smugglers are sawing through new sections of Trump’s border wall,”</b> by WaPo’s Nick Miroff in San Diego: “Smuggling gangs in Mexico have repeatedly sawed through new sections of President Trump’s border wall in recent months by using commercially available power tools, opening gaps large enough for people and drug loads to pass through, according to U.S. agents and officials with knowledge of the damage.</p>
        <p><b>“The breaches have been made using a popular cordless</b> household tool known as a reciprocating saw that retails at hardware stores for as little as $100. When fitted with specialized blades, the saws can slice through one of the barrier’s steel-and-concrete bollards in a matter of minutes, according to the agents, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the barrier-defeating techniques.</p>
        <p><b>“After cutting through the base of a single bollard,</b> smugglers can push the steel out of the way, allowing an adult to fit through the gap. Because the bollards are so tall — and are attached only to a panel at the very top — their length makes them easier to push aside once they have been cut and are left dangling, according to engineers consulted by The Washington Post.” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/smugglers-are-sawing-through-new-sections-of-trumps-border-wall/2019/11/01/25bf8ce0-fa72-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html"><u>WaPo</u></a></p>

        <p><b>-- SPEAKING OF WHAT’S PLAYING ACROSS THE COUNTRY … “Is the anti-Trump suburban revolt escalating? Watch Virginia,” </b>by AP’s Steve Peoples and Alan Suderman in Richmond, Va.: “Nearly three years into Trump’s administration, Virginia’s leftward shift appears to be rapidly accelerating. Since the beginning of 2017, Democrats have won every statewide contest, made historic gains in the House of Delegates and picked up three additional congressional seats. And on Tuesday, Democrats are just a handful of new seats away from seizing control of both chambers of the Virginia legislature for the first time in more than two decades.</p>
        <p><b>“Voters across several other states also head to the polls Tuesday, </b>including Mississippi and Kentucky, whose high-profile gubernatorial races have attracted Trump’s direct involvement.</p>
        <p><b>“But more than anywhere, Virginia’s lower-profile </b>state legislative elections will test the magnitude of the GOP’s suburban slide. Democratic victories could reshape the national political landscape in 2020 — and, perhaps more broadly, politics across the South for decades. Like Virginia, suburban North Carolina, Georgia and Texas have seen explosive growth and demographic shifts in recent years that have given Democrats real momentum, even if they have yet to break through.” <a href="https://apnews.com/45a6cfc2e90d41c5a5155cbc3b4e1a02"><u>AP</u></a></p>

        <p><b>“This summer, Parnas told potential business associates </b>that his company began receiving payments from the oligarch, Dmytro Firtash, who is living in Austria while fighting bribery charges in the US, the sources told CNN.</p>
        <p><b>“Parnas also told these people he met with Firtash</b> several times over the summer while in Vienna.

        <p><b>-- “Growing number of GOP senators consider acknowledging Trump’s quid pro quo on Ukraine,” </b>by WaPo’s Rachael Bade and Seung Min Kim: “A growing number of Senate Republicans are ready to acknowledge that President Trump used U.S. military aid as leverage to force Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his family as the president repeatedly denies a quid pro quo.</p>
        <p><b>“In this shift in strategy to defend Trump,</b> these Republicans are insisting that the president’s action was not illegal and does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense as the Democratic-led House moves forward with the open phase of its probe.</p>

        <p><b>“His actions show concern inside the White House</b> about the extent of the President's role in the push for investigations that could help Trump politically. Tim Morrison, the President's top Russia adviser, had multiple conversations with American Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.

Morrison told lawmakers he thought Sondland was a ‘free radical,’ according to two of the sources. The term was a reference to molecules that cause cancer.</p>
        <p><b>“To find out whether Sondland had talked to the President,</b> Morrison went so far as asking Trump's executive secretary if the President had actually talked with Sondland.

          <p><b>WASHINGTON INC. -- “K Street’s newest star built business on dubious claims of Trump ties,” </b>by WaPo’s Beth Reinhard and Jonathan O'Connell: “Since President Trump took office, the lobbyist Michael Esposito has been wildly successful, turning a family business that once focused on municipal transportation issues into one of the fastest-growing lobbying firms in Washington. Esposito has broken into the international market, landing top-dollar Ukrainian clients last year and collecting $1.65 million from Chinese tech giant Huawei in a three-month period this year, according to lobbying records. In all, Esposito’s firm, Federal Advocates, pulled in five times as much money in 2018 as it did in the year before Trump took office, records show.</p>
          <p><b>“Fueling that rise, at least in part, are Esposito’s claims</b> that he is uniquely positioned: a former Capitol Hill staffer who is close to centers of power in the Trump administration. Esposito has ‘an open line of communication to the President of the United States’ and is in ‘regular’ contact with the president, Federal Advocates wrote in three contract bids reviewed by The Washington Post. The same proposals say Esposito worked with the president’s son Eric Trump and son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner on real estate deals. And the firm’s website calls Esposito ‘an integral part of the senior-most leadership’ of the Republican National Committee.</p>
          <p><b>“Some of those very people, however, told The Post </b>that Esposito’s claims are greatly embellished — or simply not true. ‘I have no recollection of a Michael Esposito,’ said Eric Trump. ‘Sounds like someone trying to trade off our name.’ ‘Jared Kushner does not know who Michael Esposito is,’ an administration official said. The RNC recently sent him a ‘cease and desist’ letter. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham did not address Esposito’s claim of having access to the president but said she did not know him.</p>
          <p><b>“Esposito declined to be interviewed for this story. </b>In emails, he stood by his claims. He said nondisclosure agreements prevent him from discussing details of his work with Kushner and the president’s son. Esposito provided a photo of himself with Trump next to an American flag at a 2017 fundraiser as evidence of his claim, in bids for local government contracts, to have a ‘strong personal and professional relationship with President Trump.’” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/k-streets-newest-star-built-business-on-dubious-claims-of-trump-ties/2019/11/01/f67de928-f5d9-11e9-829d-87b12c2f85dd_story.html"><u>WaPo</u></a></p>

          <p><b>-- “What John Rawls Missed,”</b> by Jedediah Britton-Purdy in TNR – per TheBrowser.com’s description: “How did John Rawls became the most influential political philosopher of the 20th century, given that his Theory Of Justice was immediately confounded by developments in American society, and reads now as a work of pure idealism?</p>
          <p><b>“The answer, probably, is that Rawls’s contemporaries </b>were captured by the sheer beauty of his vision. He wanted a society that proceeded by consensus, where inequalities were curtailed, and where the interests of the poorest came first.

Mostly to crooks, by this account. The root problem is that government allocates crude oil to large end-users, and subsidises gas prices mightily at the pump — with the general result that the crude gets captured by militias, while gas station owners bank their subsidies and re-sell their fuel to smugglers for export, leaving Libyan drivers to queue for days and pay black-market prices for the trickle of fuel that does reach the domestic market.” <a href="https://chathamhouse.shorthandstories.com/libya-rich-in-oil-leaking-fuel/index.html"><u>Chatham House</u></a></p>
