VÅLERENGA - AVALDSNES 1–1

Victoria Ludvigsen's 1-0 score after 58 minutes seemed to be decisive for Monica Knudsen's team, but Giovanna de Oliveira's overtime equalizer made the victory smoke.
- It was like hell then. We let them down for a chance at the last second, said Vålerenga's sports manager Eli Landsem just after the match.
""We had control of the whole fight, so we should have avoided this,"" Landsem said.
Now Vålernga has to wait almost two weeks before they can secure the silver behind series champion LSK Women.

Sandviken's chairman: - We will take gold next year

There is still excitement about who takes the silver. Klepp beat Arna-Bjørnar 4-0 and has 41 points, while Vålerenga is two points ahead. Sandviken, who only managed 2-2 against Kolbotn after letting in the 94th minute, can be number three if Klepp loses the last series round against the bottom team Arna-Bjørnar.
The league's worst team in Fart took the shocking lead both once and twice in the opening match against LSK Women in the LSK Hall. First, Sara Johansen trailed 1-0 after seven minutes, before Åsa Helmvall increased to 2-0 four minutes later.
The yellow-clad did not get any closer than Elise Thorsnes' reduction to 1-2 just before the break. It was LSK Women's second loss this season.
Now it is also certain that Lyn will play qualifying to stay in the Top Series after 1-1 in the bidder against Røa.
