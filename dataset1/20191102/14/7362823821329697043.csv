Since Sanders clinched her endorsement, she has featured prominently in his campaign. Ocasio-Cortez spoke at Sanders’ return to the campaign trail since heart surgery earlier this month, where she told a New York rally how the senator inspired her to embark on her own political bid.
""It wasn't until I heard of a man by the name of Bernie Sanders that I began to question and assert and recognize my inherent value as a human being that deserves health care, housing, education and a living wage,” she said.
She said Sanders had spent decades fighting for those things to make life for her better, such as the Children’s Health Insurance Plan (CHIP), universal health care, and student debt forgiveness.
“Bernie Sanders did not do these things because they were popular and that’s what we need to remember,” she said. “No one wanted to question this system and in 2016 he fundamentally changed politics in America.”
