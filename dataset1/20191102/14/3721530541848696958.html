      <p>Halloween has come and gone, but I’ve always been fascinated by the holiday. Wanting to learn more about it, I picked up Lisa Morton’s book <a href="https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/T/bo14450607.html"><i>Trick or Treat: A History of Halloween</i></a>. Morton, a noted horror author, delves deeply into the origins of the holiday for a fun, fact-filled read.</p>
      <p>Morton first goes through the holiday’s origins as an agricultural event, its injection into the United States with Irish immigrants, and up through the modern day, as a celebration of all things pop culture and horror. What fascinated me the most was how the iconography of the day changed with time — how companies adopted the colors of orange and black that we associate with the day, not to mention the images of witches, black cats, and ghosts that seem like permanent fixtures. It’s a holiday that’s changed immensely since its earliest days, and already, it has me thinking about what changes we might get in the coming years.</p>
      <p>Now that November is here, here are 17 new science fiction and fantasy books hitting stores this month that you should pick up.</p>

      <p>In her debut novel, <i>City of Broken Magic</i>, Mirah Bolender introduced readers to 20-year-old Laura Kramer, the apprentice to a sweeper in the island city of Amicae. Her world is plagued by an infestation, unleashed centuries ago by magicians. She’s part of a team that helped contain the threat, and ended up saving the city. In this sequel, Laura discovers that there are new, more dangerous threats to the city in the form of belligerent bureaucracy, and criminals. To save the city once again, she and her friend Okane must travel to Rex to confront the heart of the problem, and confront a long-simmering conspiracy behind the infestation. <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-250-16929-7"><i>Publishers Weekly</i> says the novel</a> is “Intricately crafted and exhilarating, this is a worthy continuation of the series with a denouement that promises more danger to come.”</p>

Seven years later, she’s back with a new novel, <i>Starless Sea</i>, about Zachary Ezra Rawlins, a graduate student in Vermont who discovers a strange book in a library. As he reads, he recognizes a story from his own childhood, and begins to track down clues as to where the book came from, eventually ending up in an ancient library hidden beneath New York City. <a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/erin-morgenstern/the-starless-sea/"><i>Kirkus Reviews</i> gave the book a starred review</a>, saying that it’s “a love letter to readers as much as an invitation: Come and see how much magic is left in the world” and that “Fans of Neil Gaiman and V.E. Schwab, Kelly Link and Susanna Clarke will want to heed the call.”</p>

      <p>In 2017, This American Life commissioned hip-hop group clipping to produce an original song for its <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/623/we-are-in-the-future">episode about Afrofuturism</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zT1ujfuXFVo">The Deep</a>. Now, author Rivers Solomon has turned that song into a novella. The book follows Yetu, whose ancestors were pregnant African women thrown overboard by slavers crossing the Atlantic ocean. She’s a historian for her underwater community, wajinru, and is responsible for remembering their collective, traumatic past. Overcome, she flees to the surface, but at terrible cost to her community. <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-5344-3986-3"><i>Publishers Weekly</i> gave the book a starred review</a>, and says that “Solomon interrogates the devastations of slavery without ever showing a white perspective, in a tour de force reorientation of the storytelling gaze.”</p>

      <p>I fell in love with Adrian Tchaikovsky’s space opera novel <i>Children of Time</i>, a phenomenal story about uplifted spiders deep in space. His next is a novella that’s a return to usual territory for him: fantasy. <i>Made Things</i> is set in Fountains Parish, a rough neighborhood where crime is rampant. Coppelia is a thief who has some extra help: some puppet-like “friends” that she’s made. They don’t entirely trust her, but they have a relationship that works. But a new discovery changes her entire world, and they all must reexamine how they understood the world, and save their city from disaster. <a href="https://civilianreader.com/2019/09/15/very-quick-review-made-things-by-adrian-tchaikovsky-tor-com/"><i>Civilian Reader</i> says that it’s an</a> “excellent short fantasy novella, one that introduces us to a new world, with interesting magic and politics.”</p>

      <h3><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250247797"><i><b>The Menace from Farside</b></i></a> by Ian McDonald</h3>
      <p>Ian McDonald’s <i>Luna</i> trilogy (<i>New Moon, Wolf Moon</i>, and <i>Moon Rising</i>) is one of the best works of science fiction to come out in recent years, about a complicated struggle for power on the Moon. His next work is a novella set in the same world, <i>The Menace from Farside</i>, about a young woman, Cariad Corcoran, and her rivalry with her newly-arrived stepsister, Sidibe Sisay. The pair and two companions head out to the Sea of Tranquility to try and locate the original Apollo 11 landing site. It’s part of a ploy to undermine Sidibe, but the Moon is a harsh place, and it might kill them first. .</p>

      <h3><a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062473271/the-andromeda-evolution/"><i><b>The Andromeda Evolution</b></i></a> by Daniel H. Wilson and Michael Crichton</h3>
      <p>Fifty years ago, Michael Crichton burst onto the technological thriller scene with his debut (at least under his own name) novel, <i>The Andromeda Strain</i>, about an extraterrestrial microorganism that threatened to wipe out humanity if not stopped in time. Now, <i>Robopocalypse</i> author Daniel H. Wilson pens a sequel to the book, <i>The Andromeda Evolution. </i>Researchers have continued to study the Andromeda organism, and an initiative known as Project Eternal Vigilance has for decades kept watch for it to reappear. As the project is about to be shut down, there are indications that the organism might have reappeared in Brazil. As researchers descent on the hot spot, it becomes clear that Andromeda has changed, and that it could be worse than before.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-247327-1"><i>Publishers Weekly</i> says</a> that Wilson “fans of the original techno-thriller won’t be disappointed,” and that he “employs his expertise to add depth and credibility to the advanced technology the scientists use, trusting the reader to keep up with his technical terminology.”</p>

      <h3><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250170101"><i><b>Sabbath</b></i></a> by Nick Mamatas</h3>
      <p>Nick Mamatas’ latest book is a loose adaptation of Matt Tamao’s graphic novel <i>Sabbath: All Your Sins Reborn</i>. It follows the story of Hexen Sabbath, an 11th century English knight who is killed during the Battle of Assandun, and is saved by a creature that claims to be an Angel. He’s abruptly dropped in to modern-day Manhattan with an assignment: he has to track down and kill the personifications of the seven deadly sins — pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath and sloth — before they can bring about the end of the world.</p>

      <p>Linda Nagata has turned to self-publishing to return to her <i>Nanotech Succession</i> series. She kicked off <i>Edges</i>, the first installment in her <i>Inverted Frontier</i> series earlier this year, and now follows up with her next, <i>Silver</i>. In <i>Edges</i>, humanity has been attacked by a fleet of robotic aliens, and an explorer named Urban is dispatched to a distant colony called Deception Well. That mission didn’t go well, and Urban has lost control of his ship, Dragon, driven out by an entity known as Lezuri. The god-like entity is desperate to return home to recover his memories, and Urban’s only hope for survival is to beat the alien to its ringworld home to find a way to stop him.</p>
