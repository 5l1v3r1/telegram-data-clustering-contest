      <h1>Facebook will let politicians run false ads during UK elections</h1>
      <h2>Its policy is about to get an early test.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T14:56:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 14:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>Facebook's policy of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-21-facebook-election-2020-policies.html">allowing politicians to run false ads</a> is going to get tested in short order. <i>CNN Business</i> has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/01/tech/facebook-false-ads-uk/">confirmed</a> that the social network won't fact-check candidates' ads in the weeks ahead of the UK election on December 12th. It will bar candidates from linking to debunked or pro-violence material, and will still scrutinize groups <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/07/30/uk-committee-facebook-fake-news-hate-speech/">like Leave.EU</a>, but voters will have to rely on skepticism beyond that.</p>
      <p>That reluctance to check ads is leading to concerns, including from those investigating Facebook. The head of parliamentary hearings <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/15/facebook-twitter-russia-brexit-interference/">looking into Facebook's practices</a>, MP Damian Collins, told <i>CNN</i> that people shouldn't be allowed to spread false claims "just because they are paying" for it. He was also disappointed in former UK politician <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/19/facebook-hires-tarnished-uk-politician-to-fix-its-reputation/">Nick Clegg</a>, arguing that he hadn't made a "positive difference" as Facebook's Global Affairs VP.</p>
      <p>It's not certain that Facebook's policy will create problems, especially when the election is happening on short notice. If there is evidence that politicians' false ads played a role, though, it could increase pressure on Facebook to alter its policies ahead of the 2020 US elections.</p>
