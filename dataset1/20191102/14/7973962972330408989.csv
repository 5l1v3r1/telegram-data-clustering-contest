Largest bitcoin derivatives exchange leaks data from thousands of customers
BitMEX Leads Bitcoin Trading Market
02 Nov 2019, 14:24 by Wagner Riggs
On Friday, Bitmex, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, had to publicly lament the leakage of thousands of emails from its users. According to the company, they are monitoring the extent of impact with the incident.
As explained, some of its users received an email containing email addresses of others. The message, according to Bitmex, referred to future changes in index weighting in the exchange.
In a statement, the company said it was taking action, as well as trying to identify where the error came from and the true extent of the impact.
And promised return:
“Make sure we are doing our best to identify the cause of the failure and will contact all users affected by the problem.”
Email Bitmex ‘Cc:’
According to Coindesk, email addresses of its users have been included in the 'Cc' field, which we know as 'copy' in English, but which originally means 'carbon copy', meaning terms analogous to old carbon copies.
Unfortunately, the article says, it opens the user account to targeted phishing attacks, because any malicious person who gets the addresses already has one of the first steps to advance further information.
Bitmex Director regrets:
“We deeply regret the concern this has caused our users. The problem was caused by an error in the software used to send emails, ”Vivien Khoo, chief operating officer, told Coindesk.
According to the executive, as soon as the Bitmex team became aware of the problem, it acted quickly so that no further messages were sent.
“We immediately prevented more emails from being sent, and have since resolved the issue to ensure it doesn't happen again,” he concluded.
Bitmex controversy
The email incident adds to the exchange issues.
The company is already investigated by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for allegedly allowing the platform to be used by Americans.
Bitmex offers bitcoin trading platform and peer-to-peer (P2P) services.
The platform's system prevents access to users from many countries, but some have been using private networks (VNP) to access, Coindesk said.
