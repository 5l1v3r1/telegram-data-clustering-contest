Highlights

Indian women's hockey team sealed its place in next year's Olympic Games after beating USA 6-5 on aggregate
India lost the second match 1-4 in the double-leg FIH Qualifiers at the Kalinga Stadium
Indian women have participated in the 1980 Moscow Olympics and qualified again in Rio after 36 years


BHUBANESWAR: Fifth minute - India 0 USA 1. Fourteenth minute - India 0 USA 2. Twentieth minute - India 0 USA 3. Twenty-eighth minute - India 0 USA 4. Aggregate scores level. India women were ahead by four goals after winning the first game on Friday 5-1. But the USA made it even-stevens inside the first half of the second here at the Kalinga Stadium 24 hours later. Minute No. 49. Rani Rampal lurks at top of the American circle, waving, crying for the ball. It comes. The skipper takes aim. GOAL! India now had the numbers to take them to the Olympics. And it happened. After 11 goal-less minutes that followed, the Indian girls jumped in controlled joy, as they had lost. But the bigger result -- they are going to Tokyo, the third Olympic appearance for India's women hockey.
USA won 4-1, but India won the two-match tie 6-5 on aggregate.



The US women couldn't believe it. They had done what they had arrived for on Saturday. Amanda Magadan's two goals and strikes by captain Kathleen Sharkey and Alyssa Parker realised the hope their team slept with on Friday. But it was India who managed to check in to Tokyo. 1980 Moscow, 2016 Rio and now 2020.
It was a game India would want to remember for the objective achieved rather than the way they played. Rani, who has been central to India's Olympic dreams for more than a decade now, saved her best for the last. And a disaster was averted.
It looked India hadn't arrived on the pitch for the second game. The US played with purpose, swarmed the Indian players whenever they had the ball. Inside their 25-yard, the US women didn't give the home team's strikers room to maneuver. The script was going the US way and decibels of the shouts from the stands decreased with every minute.
At half-time, the game stood on level terms. USA were up 4-0, and had erased India's advantage, leaving everything to play for.
At half-time, a pep talk in the Indian change-room went like this: ""I told the girls, it's 0-0,"" said Marijne after the match. ""It's your moment, go out with your head up.""
It worked, but only in not allowing US score anymore goals in the third quarter. India fell back well after losing possession and started defending in numbers. The US strikers were visibly frustrated to see things changing.
""Trailing 0-4, you need to work harder. I think the girls put in a lot of energy till the last moment,"" said star of the match Rani.
And then the 49th minute arrived, which will remain etched in the memories of Indian fans, especially the likes of teenagers like Laremsiami, Sharmila Devi and Salima Tete, who would have never experienced anything like this before. Rani had scored the goal that earned India the ticket to Tokyo.
Coach Sjoerd Marijne, though, may not have any nails left, as the game tested the mental strength of the best. But he isn't just contend with reaching the Olympics.
""The preparations starts tomorrow,"" he replied, when asked where's the party tonight?
It will be a hard one for US hockey, where the game is predominantly women-oriented. Not going to the Olympics won't do any good to the funding they would need to grow the game. But that's to be pondered later.
This moment belongs to India's women's hockey that has had a tremendous run over the last 18 months, and it couldn't have reaped a better result.

Real Madrid’s supporters are notoriously difficult to please and one of the club’s star strikers has now hit back at the criticism after scoring his first goal for Los Blancos.

Zinedine Zidane’s side were active in the latest transfer window in which they spent more than €300 million (R5 billion) in transfers to bolster their squad.
One of the new arrivals was Serbian striker Luka Jovic who joined Real for a reported fee of €60 million (R1 billion) after excelling with Bundesliga side Eintracht Frankfurt last season.
The 21-year-old has struggled to live up to expectation, however, and was heavily criticized after drawing a blank in each of his first nine appearances for the club.

Jovic broke his drought with a goal in the LaLiga giants' 5-0 win over Leganes on Wednesday and the former Benfica forward has now responded to his critics.
"" It was a difficult period for me, for my career,” he revealed to Marca.
“Although I have never doubted my quality, nor have the people close to me, like my colleagues and my coach, the public was very hard and it was not pleasant to read those articles. I hope they will start trusting me more.”

Jovic scored 27 goals in 48 appearances for Frankfurt last season and was named in both the Bundesliga and UEFA Europa League Team of the Season.
