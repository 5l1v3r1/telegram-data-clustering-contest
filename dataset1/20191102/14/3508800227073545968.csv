《敲醒生命自癒力》：運用「思維場療法」根除壓力與憂鬱的起因
02 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是如果把「壓力」和「憂鬱」這兩個詞看成動詞，從這個意義上說，你不是「得了」憂鬱，而是你「進行」憂鬱。從這觀點來看，憂鬱就不像麻疹那般是你會「得到」的一種病；如果你被感染，你才是「得」麻疹。



文：珍妮・湯普森（Janet Thomson）
什麼是思維場？
請花片刻時間回想令你最快樂的一件事：也許是初次和某個特別的人見面、孩子出生、達成令你驕傲無比的某件事、考到駕照的成就感和獨立感、某個浪漫片刻，或者你感到美妙無比的時光。讀完這一段文字後，闔上雙眼，讓自己沉浸在那段回憶裡。浸淫在那畫面裡，凝視你過去所見的一切，讓你的耳朵與心靈再次聆聽以前聽過的聲音，聞一聞你聞過的味道。回想這一切帶給你什麼感受——這感受出現在你身體的哪個部位？在你肚子裡？也許心裡感到七上八下？現在讓這些正面情緒和回憶在你體內流動一分鐘左右……
留意一下，這則回憶不僅僅「只是一個念頭」而已，而是一種生理經驗，一種你在想像中重新體驗之際，身心所協力運作的融合。也許你感到興奮？或是放鬆？我不知道你感覺多麼美好，但你的確是。
你有沒有過與某個會「釋放」正能量的人共處一室的經驗？當你靠近他們（也就是進入他們的能量場）不由得感覺到他們散發正能量？遺憾的是，反之亦然。有些人很會散播負面思維，你靠近他們時，會被他們的負能量感染。這樣的人你不該花太多時間跟他（她）相處。
思維至關重要
我們往往低估生理上與某個思緒之間的連結，這種連結終究說來是一連串的化學反應，它基本上對我們造成的影響是整體性的，身、心、靈三方面都有。雖然我們看不到自己的能量場，並不代表它不存在，或不在日常功能的層面起作用。
不妨想想地心引力，你感覺不到它，但你知道它的存在，它具有某些特性，並遵循可信又可預測的準則。假如你不小心掉了東西，那東西會落到地上，不會飛到天空。牛頓最初就是注意到蘋果從樹上掉下來，他不需要先「看見」地心引力才能去探究它的影響。
如果你倒立個五分鐘，你會感覺到腦部壓力增加，因為血液流向你的腦部，而腦部並沒有任何方法能夠對抗地心引力讓血液向上回流。當你直立時，也就是雙腳著地站立，你有一個由血管和瓣膜構成的神奇系統，把在全身流動的血液推回心臟。每當你移動，大腿的肌肉就會促進這個作用。人無疑天生要用雙腳站立，而不是用頭！
看見蘋果從樹上掉下來之後，牛頓開始探究地心引力及其廣泛的影響。這相當令人驚奇，不是嗎？一個表面上看似微不足道、但實際上卻是極為敏銳的觀察，簡單到只是看見蘋果從樹上掉下來（太多人看過這個現象卻完全不假思索），最後竟發現了月球就是靠著地球引力繞著地球轉。牛頓繼而發展出方程式來計算重力的影響，得出萬有引力這個結論。真是了不起，我們的肉眼根本看不到它。
不論是單一思維或一連串思緒都以差不多的方式產生深遠的影響，並擴及身體上細胞層次的生理作用，潛在地牽動我們的每一部分。我們的思緒的確至關重要。
思緒對我們起什麼作用？
我們有多麼常聽到「壓力是對健康有害的風險因子」，可能引發心臟病（「生病」﹝disease﹞換句話說就是「不－舒服」﹝dis-ease﹞）和癌症的說法？然而我們卻認為壓力跟「生活型態」比較有關係，跟我們真正的思維比較沒有關係。
如果把「壓力」和「憂鬱」這兩個詞看成動詞，從這個意義上說，你不是「得了」憂鬱，而是你「進行」憂鬱。從這觀點來看，憂鬱就不像麻疹那般是你會「得到」的一種病；如果你被感染，你才是「得」麻疹。
要變得憂鬱，你必須以某種方式處理許多感受和日常經驗，腦中轉著某些（負面的）想法，在生理上和情緒上採取某些（負面的）行為，加總起來打造出憂鬱的狀態。假如你停止用這種方式進行這些事，你就會停止憂鬱。當然我不是說這很容易，我無意以任何方式輕忽憂鬱的影響。關鍵的問題是你如何停止「進行」憂鬱？
我和其他從業者自實務工作中發現到，某些行為和想法構成了你「進行」憂鬱的舉動，運用思維場療法你可以根除那些行為和想法的起因，重拾你對生活的掌控。你將會在後續篇章學會這些技巧。
警告！千萬不要低估了負面思維對身體的潛在破壞力。
知名的細胞生物學家布魯斯．李普頓（Bruce Lipton）博士，探究了包括思維和情緒在內的非臨床因素對細胞的影響。他在《信念的力量》（The Biology of Belief） 這本傑出的著作裡，闡述人類細胞好比電腦單元，細胞外部的影響可以改寫細胞的運作程式。他把人類細胞核比擬為記憶體，把基因程式（DNA programmes）比擬為硬碟。你可以把磁碟片插入電腦並下載新檔案或程式；即便後來把磁碟片移除，這些程式依然可以運作，因為這些程式已經「融入」電腦單元的運作中。
李普頓發現，細胞膜上的很多受器會傳遞出影響細胞行為的信息，這就好比用鍵盤打字把指令輸入電腦。他造出「神奇細胞膜」（magical membrane）一詞，你的思緒和信念會強烈影響神奇細胞膜，這過程確實可以改變細胞的生物作用，因而影響你的情緒和生理的健康。簡言之，你怎樣思考，你就是怎樣的人。
身心的連結是一種精微的動態平衡。
日本的作者兼研究者，也是另類醫學的醫師江本勝博士（Masaru Emotos），反覆進行了幾項實驗，呈現人的思維對於水形成的威力。我們都知道水會適應物理環境而變形，也都知道水冰凍後會結晶，遇熱會變成水蒸氣。江本勝博士呈現的是水接收不同的意念和語詞後所形成的驚人變化。他指出，水在冰凍之前接收特定的負面思維或語詞，會形成醜陋的結晶。相反的，接收到正面的思維或語詞，冰凍後的水會形成美麗的結晶體。你可以在網路上搜尋這項研究的圖片和照片，也可以在江本勝博士所著的《來自水的訊息》（Messages from Water）一書裡找到。
如果你能考慮到嬰兒體內有百分之七十八是水份，成人體內的水份大約占百分之六十五，細胞內每一個新陳代謝的反應都是在「濕潤」的環境裡發生，再考慮到你的思維和情緒會對「你」的分子結構產生劇烈影響，那麼你便會明白，消除負面思維與情緒對於良好的身心健康有多麼重要。

思維場療法，喚醒你體內強大的自癒力！

只要當眾演說就害怕？曾有難以跨越的創傷經歷？經常莫名焦慮流淚？你敢相信，自己有一天能不再受各種大小焦慮、恐懼與負面情緒所影響嗎？來試試思維場療法＋神經語言學，改善情緒、自我療癒，就從敲通身體經絡做起！
思維場療法（TFT）透過敲打穴位來治療身心症狀，例如焦慮、恐慌、童年創傷等，不需服藥，沒有副作用，人人都可以學，由美國心理醫師卡拉漢博士所創立，至今已超過30年，成功率高達98%。
本書作者珍妮・湯普森是思維場療法治療師，她解釋這療法蘊含多種概念，如人體運動學與經絡學；此外思維與情緒兩者會交互影響，壞的情緒導致思緒紊亂，這是諸多心理病症的根本原因。為了讓敲打發生療效，必須「進入思維場」，也就是回到造成思緒混亂的情境。
湯普森巧妙地將經絡形容為「情緒信息的公路網」，而人們所經歷的創傷事件則如同公路阻塞。若要疏通情緒公路，就得追溯創傷的源頭，也就是進入事件當下的思維場域，同時配合正確的序位開始敲打，疏通當時連結的經絡能量信息，心理的糾結便能迎刃而解。
作者更介紹神經語言學（NLP）的概念，讓苦於悲傷、憂鬱、恐慌、焦慮的人能透過體感、聽覺、視覺等感官，調整情緒、積累正能量，甚至能增進動機、提高自尊，不再輕易陷入負面情緒的漩渦中。
準備好敲走你的恐懼、焦慮、創傷與負面情緒了嗎？現在就開始吧！

本書特色


西方神經語言學 ╳ 東方經絡智慧，兩大概念於思維場療法上匯聚，你我都能藉由敲打獲得正面能量！
全書收錄30幅動作示範，搭配簡明易懂的穴位敲打說明，馬上就能體驗最自然、無毒且非侵入式的自我療法。
對治大大小小如焦慮、恐懼與創傷等的心理病症，積累正面能量，同時提高自尊與增進動力。
收錄個案接受思維場療法後，從痛苦、創傷、愧疚、減重等長期困擾中掙脫束縛的案例，其中的生命故事動人，也易引起共鳴。

""Knocking on Life and Self-Healing Power"": Using ""Thinking Field Therapy"" to Eliminate the Causes of Stress and Melancholy
02 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is that if you think of the words ""stress"" and ""melancholy"" as verbs, in this sense, you are not ""getting"" melancholy, but you are ""going"" melancholy. From this point of view, depression is not a disease that you will ""get"" like measles; if you are infected, you are ""getting"" measles.



Text: Janet Thomson
What is the thinking field?
Please take a moment to recall one of the happiest things: maybe the first time you meet someone special, the child is born, you get something that makes you proud, the sense of accomplishment and independence of the driver’s license, some Romantic moments, or a time when you feel wonderful. After reading this paragraph, squint your eyes and let yourself immerse yourself in that memory. Immerse yourself in the picture, staring at everything you have seen in the past, letting your ears and mind listen to the sounds you have heard before, and smell the smell you smell. Think back to what it brings to you - where does this experience appear in your body? In your stomach? Maybe I feel like I’m up and down? Now let these positive emotions and memories flow in your body for a minute or so...
Keep in mind that this recollection is not just ""just a thought"", but a physiological experience, a fusion of the synergy of mind and body as you re-experience in imagination. Maybe you are excited? Or relax? I don't know how wonderful you feel, but you are.
Have you ever had a room with someone who would ""release"" positive energy? When you approach them (that is, enter their energy field), they can't help but feel that they are emitting positive energy? Unfortunately, vice versa. Some people will spread negative thoughts, and when you get close to them, they will be infected with their negative energy. Such a person should not spend too much time with him or her.
Thinking is crucial
We often underestimate the connection between a physical and a certain thought. This connection is ultimately a series of chemical reactions. It basically affects us as a whole, body, mind and spirit. Although we don't see our energy field, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist, or it doesn't work at the level of everyday function.
Think about gravity, you can't feel it, but you know it exists, it has certain characteristics, and it follows credible and predictable criteria. If you accidentally drop something, it will fall to the ground and will not fly to the sky. Newton first noticed that Apple fell from the tree. He didn't need to ""see"" gravity to explore its influence.
If you stand up for five minutes, you will feel an increase in brain pressure, because blood flows to your brain, and there is no way in the brain to counter gravity to allow blood to flow back. When you stand upright, that is, your feet stand on the ground, you have a magical system of blood vessels and valves that push the blood flowing through your body back to your heart. Whenever you move, the muscles of the thigh will promote this effect. People are undoubtedly born to stand with their feet, not with their heads!
After seeing the apple fall from the tree, Newton began to explore gravity and its wide-ranging effects. This is quite amazing, isn't it? A seemingly insignificant but actually extremely sharp observation on the surface is as simple as seeing the apple fall from the tree (too many people have seen this phenomenon without thinking about it), and finally found that the moon is leaning around the earth. The earth turns. Newton then developed an equation to calculate the influence of gravity and came to the conclusion that gravity is universal. It’s amazing, we can’t see it with our naked eyes.
Whether it is a single thought or a series of thoughts, it has a profound effect in a similar way, and extends to the physiological role of the cellular level at the body, potentially affecting each part of us. Our thoughts are indeed crucial.
What role do thoughts have for us?
How often do we hear that ""stress is a risk factor that is harmful to health"", which may lead to heart disease (""disease"" in other words, ""dis-ease"") and cancer? However, we believe that stress is more related to ""life style"" and has nothing to do with our true thinking.
If you think of the words ""stress"" and ""melancholy"" as verbs, in this sense, you are not ""getting"" melancholy, but you are ""going"" melancholy. From this point of view, depression is not a disease that you will ""get"" like measles; if you are infected, you are ""getting"" measles.
To become depressed, you must deal with many feelings and daily experiences in some way, with some (negative) thoughts in your mind, taking some (negative) behaviors physically and emotionally, adding up to create Melancholy state. If you stop doing these things in this way, you will stop melancholy. Of course, I am not saying that it is very easy. I have no intention of neglecting the influence of melancholy in any way. The key question is how do you stop ""going"" depression?
I and other practitioners have discovered from their practical work that certain behaviors and ideas constitute a gesture of ""going"" melancholy. You can use mental field therapy to eradicate the causes of behaviors and thoughts and regain control of your life. You will learn these techniques in the next chapters.
caveat! Never underestimate the potential damage of negative thinking to the body.
Well-known cell biologist Bruce. Dr. Bruce Lipton explores the effects of non-clinical factors, including thinking and emotions, on cells. In his outstanding work, The Biology of Belief, he explains that human cells are like computer units, and that the effects of the outside of the cell can rewrite the cell's operating program. He compared the human cell nucleus to memory and the DNA program to a hard disk. You can insert a floppy disk into your computer and download a new file or program; even if you remove the floppy disk later, these programs will still work because they are ""integrated"" into the operation of the computer unit.
Lipton found that many receptors on the cell membrane convey information that affects cell behavior, which is like typing a keyboard into a computer. He created the word ""magical membrane"", and your thoughts and beliefs strongly influence the magical cell membrane. This process can really change the biological effects of cells, thus affecting your emotional and physical health. In short, how do you think about who you are.
The connection between body and mind is a subtle dynamic balance.
The author and researcher in Japan, also an alternative medicine physician, Masaru Emotos, has repeatedly conducted several experiments to show the power of human thinking for water formation. We all know that water will adapt to the physical environment and it will be deformed. It is also known that water will crystallize after freezing, and it will turn into water vapor when it is heated. Dr. Jiang Bensheng presents the amazing changes that water has formed after receiving different ideas and words. He pointed out that receiving certain negative thoughts or words before water freezes will form an ugly crystallization. Conversely, when you receive positive thinking or words, the frozen water will form beautiful crystals. You can search the web for pictures and photos of the study, or you can find it in the book Messages from Water by Dr. Jiang Bensheng.
If you can consider that 78% of the baby's body is water, the body's water content is about 65%. Every metabolic reaction in the cell occurs in a ""wet"" environment. Considering that your thinking and emotions will have a dramatic impact on the molecular structure of ""you"", then you will understand how important it is to eliminate negative thinking and emotions for good physical and mental health.
