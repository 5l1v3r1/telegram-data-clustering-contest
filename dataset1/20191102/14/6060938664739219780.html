      <h1>Akshay Kumar’s ‘Laxmmi Bomb’ set to clash with Salman Khan’s ‘Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai’ on Eid 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T14:04:10+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 14:04</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Come Eid 2020, it is going to be a clash of the titans as <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Akshay-Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a> is set to take on <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Salman-Khan">Salman Khan</a> at the box office.</p>
      <p>The makers officially announced that the release of ‘Laxmmi Bomb’ has been advanced and will now hit screens on Eid, 2020, a date Salman picked for the release of '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Radhe">Radhe</a>: Your Most Wanted Bhai'.</p>
      <p>“EID 2020 ko, saare desh mein machega shor, jab fatega #LaxmmiBomb aapke nazdeeki cinema gharon mein,” read a tweet from the film’s official handle.</p>
      <p>The makers even shared a poster of sorts that featured Akshay’s first look along with the release date in bold at the bottom.</p>

      <p>'<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Laxmmi-Bomb">Laxmmi Bomb</a>' which is a Hindi remake of the 2011 Tamil film 'Muni 2: Kanchana’, will also feature <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kiara-Advani">Kiara Advani</a> in a leading role.</p>
      <p>On the festive occasion of Navratri, the actor shared his first look from the film that saw him with a fierce look on his face, dressed in a cotton pink saree. The fact that the Khiladi of Bollywood is portraying such character onscreen for the first time has already got his fans excited.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Akshay had initially booked Eid 2020 for the release of his film 'Sooryavanshi', but advanced the release to avoid a clash with Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Inshallah' starring Salman Khan and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Alia-Bhatt">Alia Bhatt</a>. However, as the film was shelved, Salman surprised fans that he would release his next cop-drama 'Radhe: Your Most Wanter Bhai'.</p>

      <p>2020 may just be Akshay’s year as he has three festive releases beginning with ‘Laxmmi Bomb’ on Eid, ‘Prithviraj’ on Diwali and ‘Bachchan Pandey’ on Christmas.</p>
