      <p>Asda will give employees an extra week to sign new employment contracts before dismissing them with the original deadline set for today.</p>
      <p>The supermarket said workers who had yet to sign the new so-called Contract 6 would be given a seven-day “cooling-off period” to change their mind before losing their jobs.</p>

      <p>Chief executive wrote to staff saying almost 120,000 employees had signed the new contract intended to boost productivity, with fewer than 1,000 yet to do so.</p>
      <p>“On Saturday, once the closing date has passed, we will write to them again, offering them the opportunity to sign up because we really don’t want any colleague to make a decision to leave and then regret it,” he said, as first reported by Reuters. </p>
      <p>An Asda spokesperson said anyone turning up for work on Sunday or Monday having not signed the contract will be asked again to do so. </p>
      <p>The new contracts require staff to be more flexible with their working hours and to work five of eight bank holidays as well as across departments. </p>
      <p>The base rate of pay is set to increase to £9 per hour from 3 November and to £9.18 from April 2020 in line with the national living wage, although night shift, which require additional pay, will be reduced from eight to five hours. </p>

      <p>It is the last of the UK’s big four supermarkets, including Tesco, Sainbury’s and Morrisons to implement more flexible working contracts.</p>
      <p>All are continuing to lose market share to German-owner Aldi and Lidl.</p>
