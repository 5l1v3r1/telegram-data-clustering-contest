      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 2 — Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim came to DAP’s defence today, saying the party should not be blamed for the country’s problems.</p>
      <p>In a report by <i>Malaysiakini</i>, the PKR president said many of the accusations against the Pakatan Harapan (PH) ally from Malay-Muslim critics have no basis.</p>
      <p>“I want to tell you here, if you have any basis, I have no problem for you to criticise DAP. But if you make them a target to show that the problems of the country are being caused by DAP, then it is not right.</p>
      <p>“This is against my principle as a Muslim. [The principle] is peace and just. What is religion without love and compassion?” he reportedly said during the Kuala Lumpur PKR Convention here. </p>
      <p>“When talking about religion, you just hate and oppress the others, and everything is the fault of the others and they were caused by DAP and others,” he added.</p>
      <p>Anwar said he has also been criticised for allegedly being too friendly with DAP.</p>
      <p>“Many places I went, the people there told me, ‘Anwar, you are good, but the problem is you are too close with that [DAP]’. Yes, many told me that.</p>
      <p>“But I am not apologetic. [Rather than] I make enemies with the robbers, murderers and those who oppress the people,” he reportedly said. </p>
      <p>Anwar also urged for PH to address the concerns raised by DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng yesterday, that the party had allegedly fallen victim to the “deep state”.</p>
      <p>“I think it is an issue of concern and the parties and government leaders have been alerted,” he said. </p>
      <p>“I think there is a need to explain [these issues] to reduce suspicions and misconceptions,” he said. </p>
      <p>DAP issued a statement yesterday saying that ongoing attempts by the authorities to target the party for links to a defunct terrorist group and spreading communist propaganda had led to several leaders questioning if they were victims of a “deep state”.</p>
