Another lawmaker rejects ‘Asin Tax’
02 Nov 2019, 11:36 by jester
HOUSE Minority Leader Bienvenido Abante joined other solons in objecting to the proposed Asin Law.
According to Abante, additional taxes on salted food like dried fish is another burden to the poor Filipinos who can afford to buy only such food.
“Sobra na ang panukalang buwisan pa ang mga produktong kailangan ng maraming asin!
“Pati mga mahihirap ay gusto pang pahirapan,” Abante said.
He said the Department of Health (DOH) can propose another measure as this Asin Bill is not acceptable to the lawmakers.
“Wala na bang maisip ang ibang cabinet secretaries natin lalo na ang DoH?” the solon asked.
Abante urged Health Secretary Francisco Duque to resolve the corruption in the department instead of pushing for a the so-called Asin Tax.
“Ayusin muna nya ang akusasyong ng korapsyon sa kanyang departmento at sa PhilHealth. Sa sin tax Oo, wag naman sa ‘Asin Tax’,” he stressed.
The DOH is proposing higher taxes on foods that are salty just like the sin taxes which aim to curtail smoking and promote public health.
Albay Rep. Joey Salceda, chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means, said that while Congress takes cognizance of the health experts’ warning on negative health impacts of high salt content of our consumption patterns, the solons are also concerned that this will constitute a tax on the entire food item.

HOUSE Minority Leader Bienvenido Abante joined other solons in objecting to the proposed Asin Law.
According to Abante, additional taxes on salted food like dried fish are another burden to the poor Filipinos who can afford to buy only such food.
“The proposal is too taxing for products that need a lot of salt!
""Even the poor want to suffer,"" Abante said.
He said the Department of Health (DOH) can propose another measure as this Asin Bill is not acceptable to the lawmakers.
“Can we not think of other cabinet secretaries especially DoH?” The solon asked.
Abante urged Health Secretary Francisco Duque to resolve corruption in the department instead of pushing for a so-called Asin Tax.
“He will first settle the accusation of corruption in his department and at PhilHealth. In sin tax Yes, not in 'Asin Tax', ”he stressed.
