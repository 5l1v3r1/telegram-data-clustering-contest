Shah Rukh Khan has always been fan favourite over the decades in the film industry. He has been ruling millions of hearts and has been crowned the 'King of Romance' by all his admirers.
Today, as the actor celebrated his 54th birthday, a sea of fans gathered outside his house to make the day even more special. While many have flooded the internet with birthday wishes for their favourite star, some other fans took things a step further by making a special cake that is a work of art in itself. The cake bears a replica of Shah Rukh with out-stretched arms on his pedestal with Mannat in the background.



While sharing a series of pictures, the note with it read, ""Here's presenting the first look of the cake that we have prepared for #SRK54. We always aim to compete with ourselves, and we are glad the cake this year turned out to be so amazing.""
Wife, Gauri Khan had earlier stated that the actor will be celebrating his special day with family by having dinner and grand celebration has been planned.
