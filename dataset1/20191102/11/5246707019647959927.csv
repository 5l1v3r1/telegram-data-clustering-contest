When Will Tickets for ‘A Colossal Discovery’ Be Made Available?



Tickets have now gone live. They will only be available until Saturday November 2 2019 at 17:00 in your local time zone.
Once the pass is purchased, to receive the ‘A Colossal Discovery’ Special Research quest, you must open Pokémon GO between Saturday, November 2 2019 from 11:00 to 19:00 local time. As with all Special Research quests, you can take as long as you want to complete the ’A Colossal Discovery’ story, though bear in mind that specific tasks may be more difficult as changes are made to the game through the year.
In their announcement blogpost, Niantic recommended ""trying your best to complete the research on Saturday, November 2, 2019, from 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. in your local time zone"", ""for an optimal gameplay experience"".
How Much Does the ‘A Colossal Discovery’ Pass Cost and How Do I Buy It?
The ticket is priced at $7.99/£7.99 and for the first time, must be purchased with real world currency (not the in-game currency – Pokécoins – which are partly available for free).



The tickets can be found in the in-game shop. In the main Poké-ball menu, hit ‘shop’ and scroll to find the ticket.
What Does Your ‘A Colossal Discovery’ Ticket Get You?



Pass Exclusive Pokémon Release: Regigigas
The headline attraction of the ‘A Colossal Discovery’ pass is the release of Sinnoh legendary Regigigas through a special research quest. This quest is similar to those for Mew, Celebi and Jirachi, aside from the fact that only those who purchase a pass will receive it.
Regigigas (#486) is a Normal-type Pokémon. Therefore its sole type-weakness are Fighting-type Pokémon. It is resistant to Ghost-type attacks.
Significantly, Niantic have confirmed that Regigigas will start appearing in the high-difficulty EX Raid series ‘in November’, meaning that there is still a free route to obtaining the Pokémon (though the premium pass gets your access sooner and far more easily considering the difficulty and selection criteria of EX Raids).
‘A Colossal Discovery’ special research rewards
As with all story quests you will accumulate items, XP, stardust and Pokémon encounters at each stage of the quest. See our ‘A Colossal Discovery’ Walkthrough’ section for more details.
Additional Raid Passes for Participants
‘A Colossal Discovery’ participants can receive up to 10 free Raid Passes when spinning Gym photo-discs for a limited period (normal rules apply in that you can only carry one at a time, but the daily limit of one free pass per spin will be relaxed).
Free Event Details – November 1 to November 4



To accompany the release of ‘A Colossal Discovery’, Niantic will be running a commemorative event for all players, focussed around the Regi-Trio that Regigigas is considered the ‘trio master’ of. This will run from Friday, November 1 2019 at 13:00 to Monday, November 4 2019 at 13:00 PDT
Regirock, Regice and Registeel in 5-Star Raids
The legendary titans, commonly called the Regi Trio or ‘Regis’ will appear for everyone to catch in 5-star raids. In the mainline games these three Pokémon are usually involved in the process of catching Regigigas, hence their involvement in this event. Their types and type weaknesses are as follows:

Regirock (#377) is pure Rock-type, and weak to Fighting, Grass, Ground, Steel and Water moves
Regice (#378) is pure Ice-type, and weak to Fighting, Fire, Rock and Steel moves
Registeel (#379) is pure Steel-type, and weak to Fighting, Fire and Ground moves

All three legendaries will also appear in shiny form for the first time.
Certain Pokémon Appearing More Frequently in Eggs and the Wild
Billed as Pokémon that are good counters to the Regi-trio, expect to see more Geodudes, Magnemites, Swinubs, Arons and Spheals in the wild. Aerodactyl, Shuckle, Sneasel, Skarmory, Snorunt and Beldum will be hatching more frequently in eggs.
Other perks:

Release of Shiny Skarmory alongside the Shiny Regis mentioned above
2x incubator effectiveness

How to Get Regigigas in Pokémon GO – ‘A Colossal Discovery’ Walkthrough



With the event now live in its first time-zones, we now know that this is a four step event featuring the following quests and rewards:

(Advice upfront: you are going to need to have all three Regis for step four – so if possible, prioritise getting at least one of each with your extra raid passes).
