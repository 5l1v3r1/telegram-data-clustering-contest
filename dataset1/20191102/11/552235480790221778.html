      <h1>England 12 South Africa 32 as Springboks crush the favourites in dominant World Cup final</h1>
      <h2>Eddie Jones' side were torn apart as South Africa lifted the trophy for a third time.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T11:01:18+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 11:01</time> by <a rel="author">Gabriel McKay</a></address>
      <p>South Africa are <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rugby">rugby</a> world champions after a dominant performance in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rugby-union-world-cup">World Cup</a> final saw them swat England aside 32-12.</p>
      <p>Eddie Jones' side were narrow favourites going into the game but they failed to score a single try as the Springboks defence gave nothing away.</p>
      <p>Two second half tries gave the scoreline the emphatic nature the Springboks play warranted, with Siyamthanda Kolisi becoming the latest South African to lift the World Cup as captain.</p>

      <p>It was clear from the opening exchanges that this just wasn't going to be England's day, South Africa sent a penalty kick just wide of the posts and England were forced into an early change.</p>
      <p>Kyle Sinckler took an almighty blow to the head from Maro Itoje's shoulder while putting in a tackle on Makazole Mapimpi and appeared to be seeing stars.</p>
      <p>The tight head managed to walk off the pitch himself but was rightly replaced by Dan Cole.</p>
      <p>South Africa were making all the early pressure and Handre Pollard put the first points of the game on the board.</p>
      <p>England were guilty of some careless possession near to their own try line and the result was a penalty. This time Pollard made no mistake with his kick as Jones' men struggled to get into the game.</p>

      <p>It took 20 minutes for England to finally get a foothold, winning a lineout and being awarded a penalty after Kolbe stuck his hands in on the floor.</p>
      <p>Owen Farrell levelled the scores and the South Africans were forced into a double change as Bongi Mbonambi suffered a concussion and Lood de Jager injured his arm. Malcom Marx and Franco Mostert were called from the bench after a very physical opening period.</p>
      <p>The Springboks soon took the lead again, Pollard converting yet another penalty, but it took some brilliant defending to stop England getting the first try of the game.</p>
      <p>Billy Vunipola was within centimetres of forcing it over the line but the South African defence stood firm and England had to content themselves with a converted Owen Farrell penalty after an incredible 25 phases in which they failed to convert the try.</p>

      <p>That proved costly as two consecutive penalties were conceded from the scrum and Pollard's unerring accuracy gave the Springboks a 6-12 lead at the break.</p>
      <p>Early in the second half South Africa made two changes at prop, and once again England gave away a penalty in the scrum.</p>
      <p>Pollard's right boot was again unerring and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/england-rugby-union-team">England</a> found themselves nine points behind. Marler replaced Vunipola to try and address the issues in the scrum, but England had a mountain to climb.</p>
      <p>The change paid dividends though as this time it was the Springboks who were penalised in the scrum and Farrell reduced the arrears. He had another chance with a quickfire second penalty but this time the England captain sent it wide.</p>
      <p>From a chance to go within three England soon found themselves nine behind once again with yet another penalty from Pollard.</p>
      <p>The final was turning into a duel between the two kickers, with Farrell converting his sixth penalty of the game to keep the contest alive.</p>
      <p>South Africa killed the contest with 15 minutes to play with the first try of the game - and what a try it was.</p>

      <p>Mapimpi punted one over the top for Lukhanyo Am, who cleverly returned the ball just as an English tackle came in. After a TMO check for a possible forward pass the try was deemed good and Pollard had no issues with the conversion.</p>
      <p>It soon became a thrashing, with Cheslin Kolbe putting the Springboks into a 20 point lead.</p>
      <p>Once again England were sloppy in possession and Slade dropped the ball under South African pressure.</p>
      <p>It rolled nicely for Kolbe who showed tremendous pace to break through a weak England tackle and catapulted over the line.</p>
      <p>The Springboks knew they had it won and played out time comfortably enough to win the World Cup for the third time in their history.</p>
