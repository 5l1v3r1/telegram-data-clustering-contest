What is the weather forecast for the US Grand Prix?
02 Nov 2019, 11:30 by Joseph Tyrrell

The US Grand Prix gets underway at 14:00 local time and the race could see Lewis Hamilton crowned Formula 1 World Champion but what will the weather be like for Hamilton's inevitable coronation?

Having been denied his sixth World Championship at the Mexican Grand Prix last time out after Valtteri Bottas finished third, Hamilton will be hoping the results go his way this weekend and that he'll move a step closer to Michael Schumacher's record of seven World Championships. 
The odds are in the Brit's favour with Hamilton needing to finish eighth or lower for Bottas to take the fight to the Brazilian Grand Prix. With Ferrari and Red Bull both very much in contention, Bottas faces an uphill battle if he wants to deny Hamilton another opportunity.
The weather forecast
The sun is going to be out for qualifying and the race itself at the Circuit of the Americas. Qualifying is set to have a temperature of 19 degrees celsius, feeling 18. Whilst the race is slightly warmer at 20 degrees celsius. 
There is almost certainly going to be no rain in Texas and humidity levels are around 30%-35% all weekend.
