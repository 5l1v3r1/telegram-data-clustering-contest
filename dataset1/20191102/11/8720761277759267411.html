      <h1>Data Breaches Reported at NetworkSolutions, Register.com, and Web.com</h1>

      <p>"Top domain name registrars NetworkSolutions.com, Register.com and Web.com are asking customers to reset their passwords after <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/10/breaches-at-networksolutions-register-com-and-web-com/">discovering an intrusion in August 2019 in which customer account information was accessed</a>," reports security researcher Brian Krebs: <i>"On October 16, 2019, Web.com determined that a third-party gained unauthorized access to a limited number of its computer systems in late August 2019, and as a result, account information may have been accessed," Web.com said <a href="https://notice.web.com/">in a written statement</a>. "No credit card data was compromised as a result of this incident." The Jacksonville, Fla.-based Web.com said the information exposed includes "contact details such as name, address, phone numbers, email address and information about the services that we offer to a given account holder...."<br/><br/>Both Network Solutions and Register.com are owned by Web.com. Network Solutions is now the world's fifth-largest domain name registrar, with almost seven million domains in its stable, according to domainstate.com; Register.com listed at #17 with 1.7 million domains.... Web.com said it has reported the incident to law enforcement and hired an outside security firm to investigate further, and is in the process of notifying affected customers through email and via its website....<br/><br/>Web.com wasn't clear how long the intrusion lasted, but if the breach wasn't detected until mid-October that means the intruders potentially had about six weeks inside unnoticed. That's a long time for an adversary to wander about one's network, and plenty of time to steal a great deal more information than just names, addresses and phone numbers.</i></p>
