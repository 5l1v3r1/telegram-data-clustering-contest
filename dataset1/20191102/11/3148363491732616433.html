      <h1>Tory Manifesto Drops No-Deal Brexit, Boris Rules out Farage Pact</h1>
      <h2>Prime Minister Boris Johnson is going to drop the ‘threat’ of a no-deal Brexit from the Conservative Party’s election manifesto to woo centrist voters and soft-Brexit supporters.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T11:43:51+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 11:43</time> by <a rel="author">Victoria Friedman</a></address>
      <p>The manifesto, which the party is set to publish in a fortnight, will instead push that the next Tory government will focus on “getting Brexit done immediately” by passing the EU-approved withdrawal treaty through Parliament if it wins a majority in the December 12th election, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnsons-manifesto-will-abandon-threat-of-a-no-deal-brexit-6gd8xj9nb">according</a> to <i>The Times</i>.</p>
      <p>Nicky Morgan, the outgoing culture secretary, told the newspaper of record: “If you vote Conservative at this election, you’re voting to leave with this deal, and no-deal has effectively been taken off the table.”</p>
      <p>The Tories hope that ruling out a clean-break Brexit will attract centrist voters and those who usually vote Liberal Democrat but who have been isolated by the party’s recent hard anti-Brexit stance. The Lib Dems have vowed that if they take power in government, they will altogether cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50 (the legal mechanism for leaving the EU).</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Johnson told ITV News on Friday: “Our opportunity now is to get this thing done, come back in the middle of December, knock it over the line and then take the country forward.”</p>
      <p>The move is a softening of Mr Johnson’s previous “do or die” stance when he pledged to take the UK out of the EU on October 31st “with or without a deal”.</p>

      <p>However, the Remainer-dominated Parliament passed a law forcing the prime minister to request an extension of Article 50 if a deal had not been adopted by October 19th. After the EU granted a <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/10/28/brexit-likely-delayed-2020-macron-backs-three-month-extension/">“flextension”</a> to January 31st, 2020, the prime minister called for an election on the grounds that the present Parliament would continue to frustrate and even stop Brexit.</p>
      <p>But despite his earlier pledges to deliver a clean-break Brexit if necessary, <i>The Guardian</i> had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/09/tory-mps-react-with-fury-to-talk-of-no-deal-brexit-manifesto-promise">reported</a> on October 9th that he had told the so-called centrist ‘One Nation’ Tories that a no-deal pledge would not be in the election manifesto.</p>
      <p>The left-wing newspaper also reported the prime minister to have said that he would not agree to a pact with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, a point he asserted publicly in an interview with the BBC last night.</p>
      <p>Speaking to political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Johnson <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx75Ikt19dA">said</a>: “The difficulty about doing deals with any other party is that… voting for any other party simply risks putting Jeremy Corbyn into Number 10.”</p>
      <p>Explicitly asked whether “there are no circumstances under which you would work with Nigel Farage”, the prime minister said: “I was very very clear that voting for any other party than this One-Nation Conservative government is basically tantamount to putting Jeremy Corbyn in.”</p>
      <p>The comments come after Mr Farage had, again, <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/11/01/farage-targets-leave-voting-labour-heartlands-makes-final-offer-boris-johnson-election-pact/">offered</a> a strategic election pact with the Conservatives, where they would stand down from contesting in each other’s strongholds to avoid splitting the Brexit vote and handing a victory to a Remain party like Labour or the Liberal Democrats.</p>
      <p>“I believe the only way to solve this is to build a ‘leave’ alliance across this country,” Mr Farage <a href="https://apnews.com/925fd89586a14f8aa7b5ef73019b0ac7">said</a> on Friday during the Brexit Party’s election campaign launch. “If it was done, Boris Johnson would win a very big majority.”</p>
      <p>He said that if the prime minister rejects the offer, “we will contest every single seat in England, Scotland, and Wales”.</p>
