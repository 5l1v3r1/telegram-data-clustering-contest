      <p>The Tesco Extra store in Roborough has been forced to close due to a leak in the roof.</p>
      <p>Repairs are being carried out at the Woolwell Crescent store.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=plymouth+live+tesco&amp;rlz=1C1GCEV_enGB821GB821&amp;oq=plymouth+live+tesco&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61j69i60.3671j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Tesco</a> spokesperson said they are hopeful the store will re-open today.</p>
      <p>There had been reports that the store had flooded but the Tesco spokesperson said that was not the case.</p>
      <p>They said: "This store is currently closed at the moment but they will re-open today.</p>
      <p>"They currently do not know when the store will re-open but it will be today at some point.</p>
      <p>"The store has not flooded. They have had a leak in the roof and they have chosen to close the store temporarily until it is fixed."</p>
      <p>The city has been hit by a deluge of rain and strong winds since the early hours of Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>Trees have fallen down all over Plymouth, whilst some areas of the south west have recorded winds of 100mph.</p>
      <p>Public transport has also been disrupted across Devon and Cornwall, with both the <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/torpoint-dartmouth-ferry-services-suspended-3494597">Torpoint Ferry and Dartmouth Higher Ferry</a> cancelling services for a brief spell.</p>
      <p>Trains have also been delayed and <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/restrictions-placed-tamar-bridge-100mph-3494604">restrictions were temporarily placed on Tamar Bridge</a> , with the central lane still closed for safety reasons.</p>
