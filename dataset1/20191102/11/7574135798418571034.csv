Yesterday came the news — which went from seeming uncertain to seeming official — that Rage Against the Machine would be reuniting and playing Coachella 2020. That would presumably mean that RATM offshoot Prophets of Rage (every member of RATM except Zack de la Rocha, with vocals handled by Cypress Hill’s B-Real and Public Enemy’s Chuck D) would be calling it a day, and now both B-Real and Chuck D have issued statements on the supergroup’s demise.
B-Real writes:
I want to say thank you to the fans that supported @prophetsofrage for the time we’ve been rocking together. It’s been an honor to rock stages and people of all ages with these guys. It’s been a great time and great memories in a short time. Rockin along side of Chuck and Tom has been amazing to say the least. It was fun while it lasted and I hope we left a big impression and that the music has been a source of inspiration for those that needed it. That was the purpose we got together. So I say to y’all stay informed, stay engaged and fight the good fight.
And Chuck D adds:
It was about doing something greater than self. 2020 keeping ZDLR spot warm for@RATM & powering a 👊🏿statement for 1000 days was a honorable truth mission in the hours of chaos from the jump… And so the bands rock on…. Let’s go
Stay tuned for more from Rage Against the Machine. Here are their tour dates:
