Nate Diaz and Jorge Masvidal will challenge for the Baddest Motherf***** belt at UFC 244 tonight.
The specially designed and produced strap will be on the line for the first and only time at Madison Square Garden in New York.
Having returned from a three-year hiatus with victory over Anthony Pettis in August, Diaz called out Masvidal and the fight was quickly put together.
Masvidal is riding the crest of a wave having recorded spectacular KO wins over Darren Till and Ben Askren this year.
Indeed, Till will bid to bounce back from that defeat when he makes his middleweight debut against Kelvin Gastelum.
The Brit arrived late in New York but insisted reports of an issue with his visa were inaccurate.

What time will the fights start?
The first fights on the early prelim card will start at 10.30pm GMT. The prelims will then begin at midnight with the main card starting at 2am.

Latest news
Nate Diaz could fight for the last time against Jorge Masvidal tonight.
Diaz takes on his welterweight rival for the specially-commissioned 'Baddest Motherf*****' belt at UFC 244 in New York.
And having fought for the first time in three years against Anthony Pettis in August, Diaz revealed he could now hang up his gloves.
“I’ll never have to fight again,"" he said. ""I didn't have to fight a long time ago. But what am I going to do? I've got all kinds of other stuff going on, but I don’t like not fighting.
“I’ll take forever off, or I’ll get back to it if anybody comes correct. The only reason we’ve had problems in the past is because you better treat me like it’s supposed to be.
""I've been in this game forever doing my thing regardless of outcome. I’m coming back my next fight stronger, better anyways.""
