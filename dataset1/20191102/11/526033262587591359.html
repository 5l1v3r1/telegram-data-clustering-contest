      <p>A 15-year-old boy was charged in a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/halloween">Halloween</a> <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/year-girl-shot-trick-treating-chicagos-west-side/story?id=66682558">shooting</a> that left a 7-year-old girl who was trick-or-treating in serious condition, police said.</p>
      <p>The boy is facing two counts of first-degree attempted murder and two counts of aggravated battery, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told ABC News Saturday. Both are felony charges.</p>
      <p>He was arrested around 1:24 a.m. on Saturday after police identified him as the primary suspect in the case, which also left a 31-year-old male wounded.</p>

      <p>The little girl was shot in the lower neck area while out trick-or-treating in the Little Village neighborhood on Chicago's West Side on Thursday, police said. She remains in serious condition, according to a statement from Cook County Health, which oversees the hospital where she is being treated.</p>
      <p>"The family of the 7-year-old girl who was shot in Little Village is grateful for the outpouring of love and support shown by all of Chicago and the nation," the statement read.</p>
      <p>She was dressed in a bumblebee costume, according to the <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2019/10/31/20942755/girl-shot-little-village-shooting-gun-violence-26th-street">Chicago Sun-Times</a>.</p>
      <p>"Obviously, the little girl wasn't the target. We think two gangs were having a dispute and one of them shot at the other," Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters Friday morning. "She just was in the wrong place at the wrong time."</p>

      <p>The 31-year-old man, who is believed to have been the intended target, was shot in the hand, according to Johnson.</p>
      <p>"Those involved don't deserve to be in our city," he said. "I'm disgusted but committed to doing everything we can to find the cowards that would engage in a gun battle during the early evening hours while children are trick or treating."</p>
      <p>Police did not release the name of the boy charged because he is a juvenile.</p>
