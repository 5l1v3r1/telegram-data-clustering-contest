      <h1>Passenger 'flies plane during scheduled flight as pilot gives instructions'</h1>
      <h2>A worrying video shows the woman sitting in the co-pilot's seat as she's told how to use the controls</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T11:43:10+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 11:43</time> by <a rel="author">Will Stewart, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-stewart/</a></address>
      <p>Footage of a female passenger apparently flying a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/planes">plane</a> during a scheduled flight is being investigated by authorities after it appeared on social media.</p>
      <p>The woman, reportedly named Anna, appears to be sitting in the co-pilot's seat in the cockpit of the plane as a pilot gives her instructions on how to use the controls.</p>
      <p>In the video, 'Anna', who is believed to be in her late 20s and is not thought to possess any flying qualifications, looks like she is flying the plane over Siberia.</p>
      <p>Reports say the flight was by Russian airline InAero involving an Antonov-24 flight from Yakutsk to Batagai - which is usually around a one hour 50 minute trip.</p>
      <p>The woman enjoyed a “real life flight simulator” on a passenger flight, said one account.</p>
      <p>The flight was reportedly made on August 31, but the video has only emerged recently.</p>

      <p>'Anna' had posted pictures and video on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> after the flight - but now these have been deleted.</p>
      <p>She wrote: “This was unbelievably cool” and added: "Thank you!”.</p>
      <p>Russian 5-TV channel reported the pilot’s name as Kirill S, and the woman was variously described as his “girlfriend” and a “very close friend”.</p>
      <p>The pilot is heard saying: “Back, to the right, now to the left and turn it back," according to The Siberian Times.</p>

      <p>She then queries the pilot, pointing at the navigation display: “Why can’t I get there?”</p>
      <p>He answers: “Well, I have no idea why you can’t get there.”</p>
      <p>If it was a scheduled passenger flight, it is not known how many people were on board.</p>

      <p>Transport prosecutors in the region of Yakutia are investigating the video, reported multiple media including The Siberian Times. -</p>
      <p>IrAero airlines told a Russian news site that it has begun a “thorough check” into the allegations.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: “There are doubts that these materials have anything to do with our airline’s activities in providing passengers transportation.”</p>
      <p>IrAero is an airline based in the Siberian city of Irkutsk operating flights within Russia and internationally.</p>
