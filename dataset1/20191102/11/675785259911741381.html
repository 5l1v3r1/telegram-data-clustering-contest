      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T11:54:09+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 11:54</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, Gayle McDonald, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>Winds topping 100mph are battering the south and south west of England as fearsome gales threaten to cancel firework displays.</p>
      <p>Fierce storm are hounding the lower parts of the country, prompting the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> to issue a severe <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> warning for Saturday.</p>
      <p>Dozens of trees have been felled in Cornwall and Devon by winds an independent weather station recorded as hitting 113mph, <a href="https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/cornwall-news/hurricane-force-winds-batter-devon-3494633">Cornwall Live reported.</a></p>
      <p>Kernow Weather Team claimed Illogan in Cornwall was buffeted by the ferocious gusts this morning.</p>

      <p>While the Met Office did not make recordings that went quite that high, the organisation's weather stations had recorded 101mph winds at the Old Battery on the Isle of Wight.</p>
      <p>Plymouth in Devon was also rocked by 83mph winds.</p>
      <p>Matt Box, a Met Office meteorologist, said: "They (the strong winds) are being caused by low pressure that has moved in from the west.</p>
      <p>"The strongest winds are found wrapped around the south western flank.</p>

      <p>"They're affecting the south west, parts of west Wales and the south coast, and will continue into the afternoon."</p>
      <p>As well as uprooting trees in the south west, the tumultuous weather has slowed down public transport.</p>
      <p>Ferries running between Dover and Calais have been delayed as have Thames Link and Great Western Railway train services.</p>
      <p>On the same day England lost the World Cup in heart-wrenching fashion, spectacle fans could suffer another blow.</p>
      <p>Firework displays across the south and south west of the country may be called off if the winds continue.</p>
      <p>"Largely by the time we get to this evening the strongest winds should have receded," Mr Box continued.</p>
      <p>"If you're out and about try and enjoy some fireworks, but check with local organisers that they're still on."</p>

      <p>When asked whether how wind could affect fireworks, Mr Box said such matters did not fall in his professional remit, before recalling an episode from his youth.</p>
      <p>"Personally I remember one New Years when my parents lit a firework in the garden, at our family home in Cornwall," he said.</p>
      <p>"The firework went horizontal. They can be affected by strong winds."</p>
      <p>Those close to the coast are most likely to suffer at the hands of the stormy weather.</p>
      <p>Nick Hughes, who lives on a boat off Plymouth, said he recorded wind speeds of 64knots at 6.30am this morning, which according to the Beaufort Scale is hurricane-force.</p>
      <p>"I woke up at 5.30am this morning because my boat was nudging the pontoon," Nick, who has lived on boats for 11 years, said.</p>

      <p>"When I checked the wind speed it was 64.4knots. It was actually slightly higher at one point.</p>
      <p>"I've never known it to be this bad."</p>
      <p>Yellow weather warnings have been issued for the south of England and the north east of Scotland today, with the warning remaining in place in Scotland for tomorrow.</p>
      <p>The Met Office website explains that a yellow warnings means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is a small chance of injuries and danger to life from flying debris as well as from large waves with beach material being thrown onto sea fronts, coastal roads and properties.</li>
        <li>There is a slight chance of some damage to trees and buildings, such as tiles blown from roofs</li>
        <li>There is a small chance of longer journey times or cancellations as road, rail, air and ferry services are affected</li>
      </ul>
