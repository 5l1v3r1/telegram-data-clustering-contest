      <p>If you're a Grinch who likes to moan when the shops start putting up Christmas displays and playing festive tunes long before December 25, we have some bad news for you.</p>
      <p>A radio station playing nothing but Christmas classics, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, went on air yesterday - a full 54 days before Santa visits.</p>
      <p>If, like us, you think Christmas can never start early enough then the jolly people at Heart radio are here to help get us into the spirit of the most wonderful time of the year.</p>
      <p>Heart extra Xmas won't waste time with presenters or news and will instead play back-to-back Christmas anthems to provide the 'perfect soundtrack to your personal winter wonderland'.</p>

      <p>All you need to do is sit back and listen to two months worth of bangers like Fairytale of New York, All I Want For Christmas Is You, Last Christmas, and maybe even some <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/justin-bieber">Justin Bieber</a> .</p>
      <p>The station will be available on digital radio by scrolling until you find Heart extra, <a href="https://www.globalplayer.com/live/heartextra/uk/">online here</a> or simply by demanding Alexa plays Heart extra Xmas.</p>
      <p>The news has gone down well on social media as people take the launch of Heart's station as the perfect excuse to get their Christmas celebrations underway.</p>

      <p>One wrote: "As of today Heart Extra is Heart Xmas! MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYBODY."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Heart extra Xmas station is officially on the radio and yes I’m that person who’s been listening."</p>
      <p>Not everyone seemed to share in the spirit with one questioning: "Surely the 1st November is too early for Heart extra Xmas?"</p>
      <p>The answer is no, no it's not.</p>
