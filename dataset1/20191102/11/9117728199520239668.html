        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> has mixed feelings following the opening two sessions of the US Grand Prix weekend. The <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> driver admitted the car felt good early on but some changes they've made have not paid off.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Vettel finished the first session in P2 after being pipped to the top of the timesheets by <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a>. However, the German dropped down to fourth as the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> got back in contention.</p>
      <p>Despite a respectable days work Vettel feels the team have a big job on their hands if they are to get back on top.</p>
      <p><i>"It's always fun here in Austin, even if the track is probably not in the best condition, given how many bumps there are,"</i> Vettel said as quoted by <a href="https://it.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-vettel-sappiamo-cosa-dobbiamo-cambiare-sulla-ferrari/4591271/">Motorsport.com</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"But that's it, we can't do anything about it and this makes everything a bit more complicated.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"The car initially seemed good to me, and this is good, but then we tried some changes that didn't go in the right direction.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"If nothing else, we understood what we need and I think we can improve on the fast lap. the race pace, however, there is still a long way to go to be at the level of rivals."</i>
