      <p>Yesterday came the news ‚Äî which went from seeming <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/rage-against-the-machine-members-staying-silent-on-reunion-rumors/">uncertain</a> to seeming <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/rage-against-the-machines-instagram-now-verified/">official</a> ‚Äî that <b>Rage Against the Machine</b> would be <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/rage-against-the-machine-reunion-confirmed-by-multiple-sources/">reuniting</a> and playing <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/coachella-2020-on-sale-friday/"><b>Coachella 2020</b></a>. That would presumably mean that RATM offshoot <b>Prophets of Rage</b> (every member of RATM except Zack de la Rocha, with vocals handled by Cypress Hill‚Äôs <b>B-Real</b> and Public Enemy‚Äôs <b>Chuck D</b>) would be calling it a day, and now both B-Real and Chuck D have issued statements on the supergroup‚Äôs demise.</p>
      <p>B-Real <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4VS1ZABkKj/">writes</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>I want to say thank you to the fans that supported @prophetsofrage for the time we‚Äôve been rocking together. It‚Äôs been an honor to rock stages and people of all ages with these guys. It‚Äôs been a great time and great memories in a short time. Rockin along side of Chuck and Tom has been amazing to say the least. It was fun while it lasted and I hope we left a big impression and that the music has been a source of inspiration for those that needed it. That was the purpose we got together. So I say to y‚Äôall stay informed, stay engaged and fight the good fight.</blockquote>
      <p>And Chuck D <a href="https://twitter.com/MrChuckD/status/1190459796815613952">adds</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>It was about doing something greater than self. 2020 keeping ZDLR spot warm for<br/>@RATM &amp; powering a üëäüèøstatement for 1000 days was a honorable truth mission in the hours of chaos from the jump‚Ä¶ And so the bands rock on‚Ä¶. Let‚Äôs go</blockquote>
