      <p>Engineers have warned of travel misery and discoloured water after a mains pipe burst on the Oldbury and West Bromwich border.</p>
      <p>South Staffs Water chiefs have urged customers they may experience murky water coming from their taps after the pipe burst in Bromford Lane at around 3pm on Friday, October 1.</p>
      <p>They have urged that the water is not harmful – but may not look 'very nice'.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Four-way traffic lights have also been set up at the roundabout, which connects Brandon Way and Kelvin Way.</p>
      <p>A clip shared by the company shows water bubbling up from underneath the pavement and creating a large puddle at the side of the road.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the company said: “We are working to repair a burst water main on Bromford Lane at the junction of Brandon Way and Kelvin Way.</p>
      <p>“Some customers may be experiencing discoloured water and although this doesn't look very nice, it's not harmful. Running the kitchen tap for about 20 minutes or until clear will help.</p>
      <p>“There will be four-way traffic lights on the island which is likely to cause traffic delays. We advise you to find an alternative route or allow extra time for your journey.</p>
      <p>“We're working to repair it as quickly as possible. We're sorry for any inconvenience.”</p>
