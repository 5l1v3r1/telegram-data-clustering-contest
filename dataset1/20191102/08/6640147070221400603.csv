Police believe Japan’s castle fire unlikely caused by arson

02 Nov 2019, 08:30

KOLKATA, India: More than 100 migrant workers from India’s Kashmir will be moved after a spate of killings by suspected separatist militants underlined the threat to outsiders in the restive region.Senior officials working for the chief minister of the eastern state of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, said on Saturday she decided to move the workers out of Kashmir to prevent them from becoming a potential target for militant groups who the government says have intensified attacks on civilians belonging to states except Kashmir.The migrant workers will be identified and moved by train to eastern states, the officials said.Last week, suspected militants barged into a house in southern Kashmir, marched out six men who had come to work in the orchards and paddy fields from West Bengal, lined them up and shot them, police said.Five died, a sixth, who the gunmen had left for dead, survived, to tell the tale that has fanned fears of further attacks on outsiders, officials say.“We have orders from the state leader to escort all the Bengali laborers out of Kashmir after five Muslim laborers from West Bengal were killed,” said a senior police official in Kolkata, capital of West Bengal.Migrant workers are a soft target for militants, and during the past few weeks 11 have been killed, including the victims of this latest atrocity, the government said.Much of Kashmir’s economy is dependent on outside laborers who work in construction, hotels and apple orchards.None of the militant groups that are fighting Indian rule in Muslim majority Kashmir claimed responsibility for the attack on migrant workers.The separatist insurgency in Kashmir began three decades ago, but the latest flare up in violence followed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision in August to take away the autonomy previously offered to India’s only Muslim majority state.India is hoping that by opening up property rights in Kashmir to people from outside the region it can reignite economic growth, create jobs and turn the focus away from a militant uprising in which more than 40,000 people have died.But for the government to have any chance of succeeding, it will have to remove the growing sense of insecurity among Indians who have risked coming to Kashmir to make a living.

WoW Shadowlands, the endgame will have a randomly generated dungeon
02 Nov 2019, 08:55 by Luca Salerno
The most hardcore players waiting for the WoW Shadowlands expansion will have to prepare for a new, challenging endgame challenge. It is a dungeon with an unpublished mechanic never seen in the series and usually associated with a genre of games in particular, the roguelikes. The game director Ion Hazzikostas described Torreterna - The Tower of the Damned as ""an endless dungeon"" and ""that changes constantly"".
The structure of this dungeon will be generated randomly from time to time as happens in the genre roguelike, known for this type of level design as well as for the high level of difficulty. But there is also another new aspect of the new WoW Shadowlands dungeon.

Unlike normal WoW dungeons, Torreterna can be faced in single or in groups with up to four characters with no special class requirements. Players will then be called upon to scale the floors of the tower and each entry will receive a buff that promises to radically change the playing style of the classes and that is why, probably, no specifications are required. Once you have completed a number of tower challenges, you will be able to receive permanent upgrades.
Hazzikostas described the tower as the second big news coming with the expansion ""because it is a bit different from all that we have seen so far in the game"". If you have already seen the trailer for WoW Shadowlands then you already know Torreterna too, especially in the spectacular final scene in which Sylvanas breaks down the barrier that separates the game world from the Shadowlands with a setting that reminded us of the Castlevania Dracula's mirror castle Symphony of the Night.
For the most avid fans of World of Warcraft we inform you that the precious celebratory version of the 15th anniversary of the game on Amazon is available.
