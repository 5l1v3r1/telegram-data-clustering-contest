Former Texas House Member Beto O'Rourke said on Friday that he was withdrawing from further fight for the presidential nomination on behalf of the Democratic Party. As a reason, he reported a lack of interest in his campaign and insufficient funds.
""I will serve the country, but not as a candidate or nominee,"" wrote Beto O'Rourke in a statement he posted on the internet.



Beto O'Rourke, 47, applied for the office of senator from Texas in 2018, but slightly lost, by just three percent of the vote, to Republican rival Ted Cruz in the state of ""republican"" fortress.
He calls for the selection of one candidate
He also managed to raise significant funds to run the campaign, among others, thanks to numerous travels throughout the state and the use of social media.
Many Democrats considered this a success and urged him to apply for the presidential nomination.
However, Beto O'Rourke did not manage to repeat this model and both its quotations in surveys and fundraising for campaigning have clearly weakened in recent months.
Beto O'Rourke called on Democrats to gather around one candidate who will have the best chance of clashing with current Republican President Donald Trump.
