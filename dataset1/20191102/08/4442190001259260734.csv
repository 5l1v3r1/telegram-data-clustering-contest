Also read the conditions not to not read, then suddenly know you are being billed roughly,"" he added, Saturday (11/02/2019). According to Tongam, before borrowing prospective borrowers must also understand the risks that occur before applying for credit. For example, you must understand if a legal fintech application registered with the OJK only requests approval for audio access, KTP picture taking to access location. ""If it is illegal, he requests approval for gallery access, contact access. That is not true, what is the connection with that? all. So be careful not to press okay okay on the button.
