連署未達標宣布退選 　呂秀蓮批總統連署規定違憲
02 Nov 2019, 08:56 by 黃雅琪, 陳毅偉
獲喜樂島聯盟推薦投入2020總統選舉連署的前總統呂秀蓮，今（2日）在連署收件截止前一刻，透過聲明宣布退選，強調由於法律及政治因素未能完成連署，並透過辦公室提出5點批評，包含總統連署規定違憲。
呂秀蓮和前南投縣長彭百顯接受喜樂島聯盟推薦投入2020正副總統選舉連署，從9月19日起展開連署活動，須獲得28萬384人連署，才可取得角逐2020總統大選的資格；原呂秀蓮辦公室發出採訪通知，預告呂下午5時親自送連署書至台北市選委會，並召開記者會對外說明，目前臨時宣布取消。
呂秀蓮透過聲明表示，由於法律及政治因素未能完成連署，深致歉意卻也體認人性之善與惡。「對所有支持者，我們衷心感謝，願一本初衷，繼續與愛好和平公義人士同心協力，共創美好台灣努力，再努力！」
另外，呂秀蓮和彭百顯辦公室提出5點批評，包括總統副總統選舉罷免法強制連署人需附身分證影本規定，侵害公民隱私權，嚴重阻礙連署進行，根本違憲；且中央選舉委員會不許被連署人在連署書上註記「回收地址」，造成國內外各地連署人不知如何回寄連署書的困擾，應負刁難之責。
第3點提到，國內主流媒體及政論節目明顯「政媒掛鉤」，淪為特定候選人的競選工具，並全面無情封殺呂彭相關新聞，形同「媒體集體謀殺 」，當權者高喊民主，卻公然摧殘民主，而媒體自甘墮落，應受國人公譴。兩人接著指控，全國各地連署站確實遭受各種形式的恐嚇、辱罵及干擾，甚至收買，以致實際收到的連署書與預期可收的數量產生嚴重落差，內情並不單純，因此決定不提交連署書。
最後，呂秀蓮、彭百顯辦公室表示，非公務機關對個人資料蒐集，應遵守個資法規定，凡已收取呂彭參選連署書而未繳回呂彭被連署人者，應承負法律責任。為此，特別呼籲各界人士提供有關連署不法情事以供查究。

The former President, Annette Lu, who was recommended by the Joy Island Alliance to participate in the 2020 presidential election, announced today (2nd) that the withdrawal of the election was announced by the statement immediately before the closing of the receipt, stressing that the legal and political factors could not be completed and submitted through the office. Some criticisms, including the presidential agreement, are unconstitutional.

""We sincerely thank all the supporters. We hope that we will continue to work with peace-loving and righteous people to create a better Taiwanese effort and work harder!""
In addition, Annette Lu and Peng Baixian’s office put forward five criticisms, including the presidential vice presidential election dismissal law, which requires the person to be accompanied by a copy of the photocopying rules, which violates the privacy rights of citizens and seriously hinders the conduct of the joint operation. It is totally unconstitutional; and the Central Election Commission is not allowed to be connected. Even the ""Recycling Address"" is attached to the book, which has caused the troubles of people in various places at home and abroad not knowing how to return the book.
Point 3 mentioned that domestic mainstream media and political programs are obviously ""linked by political media"", which is a campaign tool for specific candidates, and comprehensively and ruthlessly bans Lu Peng's related news, in the same way as ""media collective murder"", and those in power shouted democracy. However, it has blatantly devastated democracy, and the media has been degraded by the people. The two then accused that all the stations in the country were indeed subjected to various forms of intimidation, insults and interference, and even bought, resulting in a serious gap between the actual number of books received and the expected number of receivables. The situation was not simple, so they decided not to submit the agreement. book.
Finally, Annette Lu and Peng Baixian’s office stated that non-public affairs agencies should abide by the provisions of the individual capital law for the collection of personal data. Those who have received the Lv Peng election and have not paid back Lu Peng’s co-authors should bear legal responsibility. To this end, we especially appeal to people from all walks of life to provide relevant information for investigation.
