大量資金外逃 中國外儲見底 外債達3.5萬億美元

02 Nov 2019, 08:43

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】受美中貿易戰影響，中國經濟增長速度降至27年來最低，加之資金大量外逃，外匯儲備持續下降。有研究機構稱，中共外匯儲備幾乎是負數，外債至少3萬億到3.5萬億美元，比官方數據高出1萬多億美元。
《南華早報》10月28日援引法國外貿銀行亞太區首席經濟學家埃雷羅（Alicia Garcia-Herrero）的話說，大陸9月份外流的資金總額達到了890億元（美元，下同），雖然中共加強了對保險、貿易公司等的審查，但是仍未能阻止資金外流。
10月25日，中國經濟學家、清華大學經濟管理學院教授魏傑發表演講，論述了當前中國經濟現狀及面臨的問題及對策。
魏傑說，中國2014年至2016年因放水導致負債太高，所以2018年至2020年是中國還債高峰期，必須保障資金供給的正常，否則就會發生大量的債務危機，進而導致金融危機。
他表示，如果本幣穩不住，外匯儲備量就穩不住。而穩匯率需穩住外匯需求和外匯儲備量。9月外匯儲備量已從3.1萬億降到3.09萬億。如果外匯供給能穩住，資金供給就不會出太大的問題，所以一定要穩住匯率。
魏傑稱，外匯供給的來源一個是自己賺的錢，一個是借來的錢，還有一個是外資進入中國帶來的錢。這三種錢裡面，真正能動用的錢，只有幾千億美元左右。外匯供給一旦出現波動，就必然影響到本幣，影響到國內的資金供給。
花旗銀行駐香港首席中國經濟學家劉利剛在報告中說，大陸9月外儲跌幅超預期，當月資本淨外流規模也超預期，中共可能進一步加強資本管控，以避免大規模資金外逃。
9月27日，中共國家外匯管理局公布數據稱，截至6月末全口徑外債餘額升至19,980億美元。但有研究機構認為，中共需償付外債或達到3萬億美元，可用的外匯儲備已不多。

中共外匯儲備是負數 外債至少3萬億

早在2017年1月，華盛頓智庫「美國企業研究所」經濟政策研究員鍾偉鋒博士對《美國之音》表示，中共外匯儲備在2016年從4萬億下降到3萬億，而3萬億中的1萬億是中共本來就該償還的外債，扣除後只剩2萬億，恐怕只能再撐一兩年。
鍾偉鋒還說，中共的外匯儲備和資金外逃是相當的。
2019年8月7日，英國《金融時報》刊文稱，根據中共國家外匯管理局公布的數據顯示，2018年中國有接近2萬億美元的外債，約占GDP的15%左右。這個數據並不算太高，但是數據下隱藏著風險：
首先是中國外債的增長速度非常快，在2017年增長20%，2018年增長12%；其次，有研究顯示，官方公布的數據可能低估了外債的水平。
举例说，日本大和資本曾在2018年8月的研究報告中說，外匯管理局公布的外債總額，並沒有包括中國企業在香港、紐約、開曼群島和英屬維京群島等地發行的美元債數量。
如果把這些美元債都算進去的話，總的外債數量可能在3萬億到3萬5千億美元左右，比官方公布的數據高出1萬多億美元。

外儲短缺 恐致人民幣大跳水

10月25日，普林斯頓社會學博士、政治與經濟學者程曉農在《大紀元》刊文說，中共必須償還外債，加之中美貿易戰導致不少外企開始陸續撤資，它們撤資和利潤匯出所需外匯也是一筆巨大的開支。
程曉農說，扣除這兩筆硬開支，外匯儲備只剩下幾千億美元可動用，而中共長期靠從美國每年淨賺幾千億美元來補充外匯儲備的路子已經中斷，今後每年進口石油、糧食、製造業零部件等經濟必須品的外匯支出，很快會把剩下那幾千億美元耗盡。
所以中共的外匯捉襟見肘，已經亮在了桌面上了。
台灣總體經濟學家吳嘉隆也表示，中共外債的壓力會降低外匯儲備，而外匯儲備降低也反映着本國貨幣發行的收縮。一旦外匯儲備不夠用，中共會更加嚴厲管制資本，進一步促進資本外逃。大量的本國貨幣會湧出來，要去結匯。
吳嘉隆說，到時人們會搶購美元，人民幣匯率會跳水，美元會猛漲，「7元不夠8元，8元不夠9元，大家會出價搶購美元。」
9月份，中國大陸的資本外流總額將近900億美元，外匯儲備下降了147億美元。
多名經濟學專家表示，中共的外匯儲備不穩，資金供給就會出大問題，會促使資本外逃、人民幣大幅貶值、美元猛漲等。另外，香港作為引進外資、技術的管道，以及金融中心的不可取代的地位，其局勢的發展也直接威脅到中國經濟及外匯儲備。
除外匯儲備吃緊外，中國的經濟也嚴重惡化，今年第三季GDP的增速同比增長6%，創中共自1992年有GDP季度記錄以來的最低增速。

外匯儲備的作用

外匯儲備又稱為外匯存底，指的是各國的中央銀行用來應付國際支付，所集中掌握的外匯資產。那麼，外匯儲備是怎麼來的？
第一，是貿易順差。中國加入世界貿易組織以來，由於國際貿易出口劇增，國際貿易順差巨大，每年賺錢了大量外匯。
其次是外資投資。如各國外商對的中國投資，或者熱錢的湧入，經過多年累積，形成了巨大外匯儲備。
最後是資本升值。通過專業的投資機構，用外匯進行投資，購買外國債券、股票、基金等等賺取的收入。
然而，並非任何一個國家的貨幣都能充當國際儲備資產，只有那些在國際貨幣體系中占有重要地位，且能自由兌換的貨幣才能充當國際儲備資產。
外匯儲備的具體形式是：政府在國外的短期存款或其他可以在國外兌現的支付手段，比如外幣現鈔、黃金、外國有價證券，外國銀行的支票、期票、外幣匯票。
一般而言，各國政府管理和經營外匯初步，都遵循安全性、流動性和營利性三個原則。
安全性指的是，外匯儲備應存放在政治穩定、經濟實力強的國家和信譽高的銀行。要選擇幣值穩定、風險較小的貨幣，還要投資比較相對安全的信用工具，如信譽高的國家債券，或由國家擔保的機構債券等。
流動性是指保證外匯儲備能隨時用於兌現和支付。各國在安排外匯資產時，應根據本國對一定時間內外匯收支狀況的預測，合理安排投資的期限組合。
盈利性是指通過對市場走勢的分析預測，進行科學的投資組合，使儲備資產增值。
外匯儲備的功能主要反映在四個部分：
一、調節國際收支，保證對外支付。
二，干預外匯市場，穩定本國貨幣的匯率。
三，維護國際信譽，提高融資能力。
四，增強綜合國力，抵抗金融風險。

A large amount of capital fled, China’s foreign reserves bottomed out, foreign debt reached 3.5 trillion US dollars

02 Nov 2019, 08:43

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] Due to the US-China trade war, China’s economic growth rate has fallen to its lowest level in 27 years. In addition, funds have largely fled and foreign exchange reserves have continued to decline. Some research institutes say that the CCP’s foreign exchange reserves are almost negative, and the external debt is at least 3 trillion to 3.5 trillion US dollars, more than 1 trillion US dollars higher than the official data.
The South China Morning Post quoted Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist of the Asia-Pacific region of the French Foreign Trade Bank, on October 28, saying that the total amount of outflows from the mainland in September reached 89 billion yuan (US dollar, the same below), although The CCP has strengthened its review of insurance and trading companies, but it has not stopped the outflow of funds.
On October 25th, Wei Jie, a Chinese economist and professor of the School of Economics and Management of Tsinghua University, delivered a speech on the current economic situation of China and the problems and countermeasures.
Wei Jie said that China's debt was too high due to water release from 2014 to 2016. Therefore, China's debt repayment period from 2018 to 2020 must ensure the normal supply of funds. Otherwise, a large debt crisis will occur, which will lead to a financial crisis.
He said that if the local currency is stable, the foreign exchange reserves will not be stable. The stable exchange rate needs to stabilize foreign exchange demand and foreign exchange reserves. Foreign exchange reserves in September have fallen from 3.1 trillion to 3.09 trillion. If the foreign exchange supply can be stabilized, the supply of funds will not cause too much problems, so we must stabilize the exchange rate.
Wei Jie said that the source of foreign exchange supply is the money they earn, one is borrowed money, and the other is the money brought by foreign capital into China. Among the three types of money, the money that can really be used is only a few hundred billion dollars. Once the foreign exchange supply fluctuates, it will inevitably affect the local currency and affect the domestic supply of funds.
Liu Ligang, chief China economist of Citibank in Hong Kong, said in the report that the mainland's foreign reserves fell more than expected in September, and the net capital outflow of the month also exceeded expectations. The CCP may further strengthen capital control to avoid large-scale capital flight.
On September 27, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange announced that the balance of full-scale external debt rose to $1.998 billion by the end of June. However, some research institutions believe that the CCP needs to pay external debts or reach $3 trillion, and there are not many foreign exchange reserves available.

The CCP’s foreign exchange reserves are negative, at least 3 trillion foreign debt.

As early as January 2017, Dr. Zhong Weifeng, an economic policy researcher at the American Enterprise Research Institute in Washington, said to the Voice of America, that the CCP’s foreign exchange reserves fell from 4 trillion to 3 trillion in 2016, while 3 trillion 1 trillion yuan is the external debt that the CCP should have repaid. After deducting only 2 trillion yuan left, I am afraid it can only last for another year or two.
Zhong Weifeng also said that the CCP’s foreign exchange reserves and capital flight are quite similar.
On August 7, 2019, the British ""Financial Times"" published a report saying that according to data released by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the Chinese Communist Party, China had nearly 2 trillion US dollars of foreign debt in 2018, accounting for about 15% of GDP. This data is not too high, but the data hides the risk:
The first is that China's foreign debt growth is very fast, with a 20% increase in 2017 and a 12% increase in 2018. Second, studies have shown that officially released data may underestimate the level of external debt.
For example, Japan’s Yamato Capital said in a research report in August 2018 that the total foreign debts announced by the SAFE did not include US dollar bonds issued by Chinese companies in Hong Kong, New York, the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands. Quantity.
If these dollar debts are included, the total amount of foreign debt may be between $3 trillion and $350 billion, which is more than $1 trillion more than the official data.

The shortage of foreign reserves may cause the yuan to dive.

On October 25, Dr. Cheng Xiaonong, a Ph.D. in sociology and psychology at Princeton, said in the Epoch Times that the CCP must repay its foreign debts. The Sino-US trade war has caused many foreign companies to start divesting, and they need to withdraw their capital and remit profits. Foreign exchange is also a huge expense.
Cheng Xiaonong said that after deducting these two hard expenditures, only a few hundred billion US dollars of foreign exchange reserves can be used. The CCP’s long-term goal of supplementing foreign exchange reserves by earning hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the United States has been interrupted. Foreign exchange expenses for economically necessities such as manufacturing parts and components will soon be exhausted by the remaining hundreds of billions of dollars.
Therefore, the CCP’s foreign exchange has been stretched and it has already been on the table.
Taiwan’s overall economist Wu Jialong also said that the pressure on the CCP’s foreign debt will reduce foreign exchange reserves, while the decline in foreign exchange reserves also reflects the contraction of domestic currency issuance. Once foreign exchange reserves are not enough, the CCP will tighten capital control more and further promote capital flight. A large amount of domestic currency will come out and go to settle.
Wu Jialong said that when people buy the US dollar, the RMB exchange rate will dip, and the US dollar will soar. ""7 yuan is not enough for 8 yuan, 8 yuan is not enough for 9 yuan, and everyone will bid for the US dollar.""
In September, China’s capital outflows totaled nearly $90 billion, and foreign exchange reserves fell by $14.7 billion.
Many economists said that the CCP's foreign exchange reserves are unstable, and the supply of funds will have big problems, which will lead to capital flight, a sharp depreciation of the renminbi, and a sharp rise in the US dollar. In addition, Hong Kong, as a conduit for attracting foreign investment, technology, and an irreplaceable position of the financial center, its development directly threatens the Chinese economy and foreign exchange reserves.
In addition to tight foreign exchange reserves, China's economy has also deteriorated severely. The GDP growth rate in the third quarter of this year increased by 6% year-on-year, the lowest growth rate since the CCP recorded its quarterly GDP record in 1992.

The role of foreign exchange reserves

Foreign exchange reserves, also known as foreign exchange reserves, refer to foreign exchange assets that are used by central banks of various countries to cope with international payments. So how did the foreign exchange reserve come from?
The first is the trade surplus. Since China’s accession to the World Trade Organization, due to the sharp increase in international trade exports, the international trade surplus has been huge, making a lot of foreign exchange every year.
Followed by foreign investment. For example, foreign investment in China, or the influx of hot money, has accumulated huge foreign exchange reserves after years of accumulation.
Finally, capital appreciation. Through professional investment institutions, investing in foreign exchange, buying foreign bonds, stocks, funds, etc. earned income.
However, not every country's currency can act as an international reserve asset, and only those currencies that occupy an important position in the international monetary system and are freely convertible can act as international reserve assets.
The specific form of foreign exchange reserves is: short-term government deposits abroad or other means of payment that can be cashed abroad, such as foreign currency cash, gold, foreign securities, foreign bank checks, promissory notes, foreign currency drafts.
Generally speaking, governments generally manage and operate foreign exchange in accordance with the three principles of safety, liquidity and profitability.
Security means that foreign exchange reserves should be deposited in countries with strong political stability, strong economic strength and high credibility. To choose a currency with stable currency and low risk, it is necessary to invest in relatively safe credit instruments, such as high-denominated national bonds or institutional guarantees guaranteed by the state.
Liquidity means ensuring that foreign exchange reserves are readily available for redemption and payment. When countries arrange foreign exchange assets, they should reasonably arrange the combination of investment terms according to their own forecasts of foreign exchange receipts and payments for a certain period of time.
Profitability refers to the scientific investment portfolio through the analysis and forecast of market trends, so that the reserve assets will increase.
The function of foreign exchange reserves is mainly reflected in four parts:
First, adjust the balance of payments to ensure external payment.
Second, intervene in the foreign exchange market and stabilize the exchange rate of the national currency.
Third, maintain international credibility and improve financing capabilities.
Fourth, enhance overall national strength and resist financial risks.
