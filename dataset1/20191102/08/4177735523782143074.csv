Русия още не вярва, че Ал Багдади е убит
Лавров заяви, че руските военни нямат такава информация
02 Nov 2019, 08:00 by Нели Христова
Руските военни все още не могат да потвърдят смъртта на лидера на терористичната организация ""Ислямска държава"" Абу Бакр ал Багдади, заяви руският външен министър Сергей Лавров, цитиран от ТАСС.
Лавров каза това в интервю за аналитично предаване по телевизия ""Росия 24"". Външният министър отбеляза, че руските военни изследват допълнителни факти, свързани с разпространената от САЩ информация за гибелта на Ал Багдади.
""Руското министерство на отбраната вече направи коментар във връзка с Абу Бакр ал Багдади. Искаме да получим допълнителна информация. Всичко беше обявено в тържествен и ликуващ стил, но нашите военни все още изследват допълнителни факти и не могат да потвърдят голяма част от това, което заявиха САЩ"", изтъкна Лавров.""Въпреки това ликвидирането на терористи, ако то наистина се е случило, е, предполагам, положителна стъпка"", каза министърът.
Американският президент Доналд Тръмп съобщи за ликвидирането на лидера на ""Ислямска държава"" на 27 октомври, припомня БТА. Тръмп заяви, че Ал Багдади е бил убит при специална операция на американските сили в сирийската провинция Идлиб. Руското министерство на отбраната заяви, че не разполага с достоверна информация за смъртта на Ал Багдади. Международната общност определи ликвидирането му за важна, но не и за решаваща стъпка в борбата с тероризма.

The delegate of the potters union assured that they will not allow layoffs in Loimar
02 Nov 2019, 08:21 by El Eco de Tandil

The conflicts in Loimar had a cessation when you were behind the Ministry of Labor of the Province of Buenos Aires dictated the mandatory conciliation. However, on November 8, when it ends, guild and factory delegates must sit down again to negotiate. José Goñi, representative of the potters' union, said in a dialogue with El Eco Multimedia that ""we are willing to carry out what we have to do so that not one of the jobs will fall.""

After the conflicts in the Loimar plant and the mandatory conciliation issued days ago by the regional delegation of the Ministry of Labor of the Province of Buenos Aires, the representative of the Ceramist Workers Federation of the Argentine Republic (Focra), José Goñi, informed that the situation today ""is normal"".
A week ago, Goni pointed out to this media that since the oven was still off, the workers did not fulfill their usual functions but performed cleaning and maintenance tasks at the plant. However, in dialogue with El Eco Multimedia, he said that ""today the situation of employees is normal, both those who are dismissed and suspended are working."" The only difference he noted was that the brick plant is stationary and that work is only being done on the floor.
However, it should be clarified that the scenario will be the same until November 8, when the conciliation ends. From there, we will have to see how it continues.
According to Goñi, in parallel negotiations are being made to agree on the future of the company and the workers. “We are always open to dialogue to find a solution. We understand that today the priority is dismissal, and we don't want factory workers thrown out, ”he exclaimed. He said that of the 41 employees, there are ten who are labeled that way.
He added that on the part of the company there has not yet been any concrete proposal to remedy the situation, as there was from his side. He also indicated that since 2008 they have been working without any constraint: “There have been no suspensions or dismissals; We haven't had a conflict, ”he said.

It is something that was expected

The critical situation facing the Loimar factory, which led it to suspend 40 employees and lay off about a dozen, was ""predictable"" as assessed by Goñi,
taking into account the increases in services and the economic crisis that affects Argentina.
“This is something that was obvious from the issue that Loimar works with water and light. Today the telegrams, especially the suspension, are justified by the increase in energy rates. So it is logical that there is a problem that affects all industries. Most companies have that difficulty, ”he said.
However, he noted that it is not the first crisis that the factory faces, but that it is the first one in which there is no brick stock, therefore the possibility of overcoming becomes more difficult.
In that sense, Goñi said that ""what we always claim is that, beyond the problem of energy and the cost of it, in Loimar, inside a brick plant, today there is no stock.""
He informed then that since the brick is not spoiled, it has no expiration date, the employer can continue working, and that ""is something we have always done.""
He even revealed that other companies that are in the same situation ""are super stocked"" so that they are not so critically influenced by the increase in services.

“I have been in Loimar for 35 years and we never had this problem”

When asked about where the problem lay, Goñi acknowledged that he could not say it exactly but said that what they have done all this time has been to listen and collaborate with the businessman.
He also said that the difficulties are not typical of this era but have already gone through some similar time ago: “I have been in Loimar for 35 years and have lived through them all. We have experienced a very similar context in 2001 and also in the 90s. But the company, at times like this, was always stocked. ”
In this way, he explained that all the material that was made today at a low price, tomorrow, in the face of a crisis, is not affected since it is not devalued. ""On the contrary, it is increasingly capitalized,"" he said.
Finally, he confirmed that ""we are willing to carry out what we have to do so that not one of the jobs will fall.""
