        <b>Facebook says it has taken down government advertising that was accused of targeting voters in marginal election constituencies.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The social media firm said the ads "were not correctly labelled" and did not include the obligatory disclaimer.</p>
      <p>Each of the ads in the campaign, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/facebook-pulls-government-adverts-targeted-at-marginal-seats_uk_5dbc77f4e4b0d8b441ce9b73">first reported by HuffPost UK</a>, said the government was investing "up to £25m" in a named town.</p>
      <p>The government said it was always planned to end the promotion on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government maintains the advertisements were not "pulled" by Facebook.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson added: "While the posts are still present on Facebook, they are no longer being promoted as the paid-for campaign has ended."</p>
      <p>One Labour MP said it was an "outrageous" use of public money.</p>

        <figcaption>The adverts were about "social issues, elections or politics", according to Facebook's Ad Library<cite>Facebook</cite></figcaption>

      <h3>Key election battlegrounds</h3>
      <p>The "MyTown" campaign promoted the government's £3.6bn Towns Fund in several key general election battlegrounds, such as Northampton, Milton Keynes and Mansfield.</p>
      <p>Each of these contain a marginal constituency, one where there were fewer than 2,000 votes separating the top two candidates in the last general election or parliamentary by-election.</p>
      <p>Parliament has not yet been dissolved and the civil service has not yet entered the pre-election period, known as "purdah", where it is barred from making major announcements that might influence the outcome of the vote.</p>
      <p>But the ads went live on Tuesday, the same day Boris Johnson secured support for an early general election on 12 December.</p>

      <p>Facebook said the taxpayer-funded ads "were not correctly labelled" as being about "social issues, elections or politics", in line with its self-enacted system to make social and political advertising more transparent.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: "Ads about social issues, elections or politics that appear on our platforms should include a disclaimer provided by advertisers."</p>
      <p>It comes as Facebook comes under <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50249719">pressure over its policies on fact-checking political advertising</a> and as rival social media giant <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-50243306">Twitter banned political adverts</a> altogether.</p>
      <p>Labour MP Ian Lucas wrote to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove objecting to the campaign, saying the targeted areas appeared to be selected for political reasons.</p>
      <p>"It would be an insult to our intelligence to say that this isn't public money being used for political purposes. It clearly is," he told HuffPost UK, calling the campaign "outrageous".</p>
      <p>A government spokesman told the BBC that the posts were published before the election was announced.</p>
      <p>"All towns selected were chosen according to the same selection methodology, including analysis of deprivation, exposure to Brexit, productivity, economy resilience and investment opportunities," he said.</p>
