「我真的做得起來嗎？」其實所謂的運動除了練「身」，也是在練「心」
02 Nov 2019, 08:00 by 伊格運動Mike吳煥能


我們想讓你知道的是除了訓練課表外，「成就目標」、「知覺能力」、「成就行為」等心理因素，我認為對於學員是否可以跨越障礙也會起到很大的影響。技術固然重要，照顧好學生的心，他就會照顧好自己的身體。



前陣子在誠品看到「球學」創辦人哈佛跑鋒的故事，在台灣靠著體育成績進大學並不是件稀奇的事，但台灣小孩在運動競爭強度更高的美國，不被歧視欺負就要偷笑，進哈佛拿的還是運動獎學金，除了很少見之外，也代表著他的強悍的身材和堅定的心理素質。
在2003年1月在亞特蘭大對陣雷丹高中（Redan high School）的比賽中，他在閃躲對手的追擊快速奔跑，腳不小心拐到，「啪」的一聲重摔在地，痛到站不起來，經過MRI檢查後醫生宣布：膝蓋十字韌帶斷裂。
膝蓋十字韌帶受傷，是很多球星退休的原因，而我最欣賞的是他面對困境再次站起展現的態度，手術後，從學習走路彎腳這些新生兒階段動作開始練起，腳踏車、八字型環圈繞行和上坡跑也是他很常做的訓練項目。在2013年11月美式足球賽季結束時，Dr Hospital頒給他一面獎牌，鼓勵他的積極復健，並成功回到場上。透明的獎牌，上面鑲了一排白色的字：
Never let waht you cannot do interfere with what you can.
天要下雨，我無法控制。但我可以決定是否不畏風雨依舊外出跑步，並且享受跑步的過程，甚至對路人微笑。
成功和失敗相對會有不同的歸就因素，而透過指導將結果指向穩定的因素、內在原因、可以控制的因素，雖然差別只有一些，但將會取得截然不同的結果。
前陣子我們訓練一位滑雪愛好者，他雖然平常有運動的習慣，但重量訓練經驗比較少，信心上略顯不足。他的訓練計畫將步入增強期，這代表著我們將用更高的訓練強度和負荷去促使他進步。
記得當天深蹲重量即將超過他體重時，他臉上帶著恐懼，轉頭和我說：「教練我真的做得起來嗎？」
我回答：「相信你受的訓練，你可以，真的不行我會在你後面。」
就這樣我們開始了訓練，那天的課表下半身我安排深蹲的4種變化，負荷皆是10下內，再搭配單側的訓練。說真的要完成，他需要很努力。
其實我也沒做什麼神奇的事，只是在他完成動作完成時，對於他的努力給予正向鼓勵。
除了訓練課表外，「成就目標」、「知覺能力」、「成就行為」等心理因素，我認為對於學員是否可以跨越障礙也會起到很大的影響。技術固然重要，照顧好學生的心，他就會照顧好自己的身體。我們其實都擁有很高的潛力，只是要插入對的鑰匙去啟動。
最後經過了3個月的訓練，現在他深蹲1RM重量來到105公斤，比預期的1.5倍體重還多了10公斤，這舉起的除了重量外，更重要的對於自己的肯定。
天要下雨，我無法控制，但我可以決定是否不畏風雨依舊外出跑步，並且享受跑步的過程，甚至對路人微笑。
Never let waht you cannot do interfere with what you can.
我覺得這是對於訓練最好的註解，運動除了練身也是練心。

""Can I really do it?"" In fact, the so-called exercise is also practicing ""heart"" in addition to practicing ""body"".
02 Nov 2019, 08:00 by Ig Sports Mike Wu Huaneng


What we want you to know is that apart from the training schedule, psychological factors such as ""achievement goal"", ""perceive ability"" and ""achievement behavior"", I think that it will have a great impact on whether students can overcome obstacles. Technology is important, taking good care of the students, he will take care of his body.



A while ago, Eslite saw the story of Harvard Runaway, the founder of ""Sociology"". It is not unusual for Taiwan to enter the university with sports performance, but Taiwanese children are not discriminated against in the United States where sports competition is more intense. It is necessary to sneer, to enter Harvard is still a sports scholarship, in addition to rare, it also represents his strong body and firm psychological quality.
In the game against Atlanta's Redan High School in January 2003, he ran fast in the pursuit of the dodge opponent, and his foot accidentally turned to the ground. He slammed into the ground and hurt. After the MRI examination, the doctor announced that the knee cruciate ligament was broken.
The injury of the knee cruciate ligament is the reason why many stars retired, and what I like most is that he has stood up again in the face of difficulties. After the operation, he began to practice from the learning of walking and kicking, the bicycle, the figure Looping around and uphill is also a training program he often does. At the end of the American football season in November 2013, Dr Hospital awarded him a medal to encourage his active rehabilitation and successfully returned to the game. A transparent medal with a row of white words:
Never let waht you cannot do interfere with what you can.
It’s going to rain, I can’t control it. But I can decide whether to run out without fear of the wind and rain, and enjoy the running process, even smiling at passers-by.
Success and failure have different factors of return, and the guidance leads the results to stable factors, internal causes, and controllable factors. Although there are only a few differences, they will achieve very different results.
A while ago, we trained a skier. Although he usually has the habit of exercising, he has less experience in weight training and a little lack of confidence. His training program will enter an enhanced period, which means that we will use higher training intensity and load to make him progress.
I remember that when the squat weight was about to exceed his weight, he had a fear on his face and turned to me and said, ""Can I really do the coach?""
I replied: ""I believe that you are trained, you can, really can't, I will be behind you.""
In this way, we started training. I arranged four kinds of deep changes in the lower part of the class. The load was 10 times, and the training was unilateral. If you really want to finish, he needs to work hard.
In fact, I didn't do anything magical, just give positive encouragement to his efforts when he finished his actions.
In addition to the training schedules, psychological factors such as ""achievement goals"", ""perceived abilities"" and ""achievement behaviors"", I think that it will have a great impact on whether students can overcome obstacles. Technology is important, taking good care of the students, he will take care of his body. We all have a lot of potential, just to insert the right key to start.
After three months of training, he now knows that the weight of 1RM is 105 kilograms, which is 10 kilograms more than the expected 1.5 times weight. This is more important than the weight.
It’s going to rain, I can’t control it, but I can decide whether I’m going to run without fear of the wind and rain, and enjoy the running process, even smiling at passers-by.
Never let waht you cannot do interfere with what you can.
I think this is the best annotation for training. Exercise is also a practice in addition to practicing.
