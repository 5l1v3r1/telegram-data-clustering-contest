我們想讓你知道的是如何用英文問人喜不喜歡喝酒、愛喝的酒種類？本期視覺造句介紹和酒相關的動詞、名詞及形容詞。



喝酒是交朋友的方式之一，酒喝下去，原本不敢開口說英文的人，可能頓時講得很順字彙又多，如何用英文問人喜不喜歡喝酒、愛喝的酒種類？本期視覺造句介紹和酒相關的動詞、名詞及形容詞。
「喝酒」兩個字，英文只需說drink
聽見「Do you drink?」就是問你「要不要喝酒?」drink本身就可以當喝酒。抽菸也是用一個字：smoke。
你喝酒嗎？
（X）Do you drink alcohol?（O）Do you drink?
我不菸不酒。
（X）I don’t drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes.（O）I don’t drink or smoke.
你真的很會喝（酒）。
（X）You can really drink beer.（O）You can really drink.
呼搭啦！這些動詞也代表喝酒

booze（豪飲）
guzzle（牛飲）
quaff（痛飲）
savor（細細品味）
toast（舉杯敬酒）

drink是酒還是飲料？
drink當名詞，指酒精或非酒精飲料，兩者解釋都可以當可數和不可數名詞。試著從句子上下文分辨是「酒」還是「飲料」：

They'd had no food or drink for 24 hours.
He made up his mind never to touch a drop of drink.
We sell soft drinks only.
Dan and I are going to grab a drink after work.

答案：

飲料。他們已經一整天沒吃沒喝了。
酒。他決心不再喝酒。
飲料。我們只賣不含酒精的飲品。（soft drink就是非酒精飲料）
酒。我們下班後要去喝一杯。

你想喝哪種酒？

I'll do a Miller High Life.（我想點美樂啤酒）
I'm gonna have a vodka seltzer.（我想要伏特加氣泡酒）
I'm gonna stick to rosé.（我還是想喝粉紅酒）
I'm gonna go Bulleit on the rocks.（我想點布雷特加冰）

What we want you to know is how to use English to ask people who like to drink or drink. This issue of visual sentences introduces verbs, nouns and adjectives related to wine.



Drinking alcohol is one of the ways to make friends. If you drink alcohol, people who didn’t dare to speak English may suddenly speak a lot of words. How do you use English to ask people who like to drink or drink? This issue of visual sentences introduces verbs, nouns and adjectives related to wine.
""Drinking"" two words, English only need to say drink
Hearing ""Do you drink?"" is asking you ""Would you like to drink?"" Drink itself can be used as a drink. Smoking is also a word: smoke.
do you drink?
(X)Do you drink alcohol?(O)Do you drink?
I don't smoke or drink.
(X)I don’t drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes.(O)I don’t drink or smoke.
You really drink (wine).
(X)You can really drink beer.(O)You can really drink.
Call it! These verbs also represent drinking

Booze
Guzzle
Quaff
Savor (small taste)
Toast (toast toast)

Is drink a drink or a drink?
Drink as a noun, referring to alcohol or non-alcoholic beverages, both of which can be countable and uncountable nouns. Try to distinguish between ""wine"" or ""beverage"" from the context of the sentence:

They'd had no food or drink for 24 hours.
He made up his mind never to touch a drop of drink.
We sell soft drinks only.
Dan and I are going to grab a drink after work.

answer:

Drink. They have not eaten or drunk all day.
liqueur. He is determined not to drink any more.
Drink. We only sell non-alcoholic drinks. (soft drink is a non-alcoholic beverage)
liqueur. We have a drink after work.

What kind of wine do you want to drink?

I'll do a Miller High Life. (I want to order Merlot)
I'm gonna have a vodka seltzer. (I want vodka sparkling wine)
I'm gonna stick to rosé. (I still want to drink pink wine)
I'm gonna go Bulleit on the rocks. (I want to mention Brett ice)
