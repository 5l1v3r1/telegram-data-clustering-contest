Economic boycott, a key symbol of the arrogance of war with the Islamic Revolution / Iran's progress has been achieved by relying on young and revolutionary forces
Dashti:

02 Nov 2019, 08:33

Yazd province's leading political expert said: ""As we trusted the young, faithful, revolutionary and jihadist forces, we were just at the forefront of our progress in the defense and nuclear energy and other fields and in gaining top positions in the world.""
In an interview with Yazdarsa, Gholamhossein Dashti, a correspondent for the Dana Road Information Network, said that the events of November 13th each undermined the legitimacy of the arrogance, saying: Imam Khomeini's exile was carried out by the US-backed Shah's regime, The regime's martyrdom of a number of students during the Islamic Revolution and the seizure and capture of the US espionage nest, both before the revolution during the US presence in Iran and after the revolution. Aid to Israel was one of the events of this day, with the capture of the US spy nest Their important positions in Iran and the region were dismantled for conspiracy against Iran, and they failed to take serious measures such as a coup and disrupt the country's political and security sector.
He continued: The issue of arrogance is not only politically important to us in relation to the Islamic Revolution, but also the issue of arrogance is one of our beliefs because the devil is a symbol of arrogance and actually fighting it is one of our beliefs. And all the prophets, along with the invocation of monotheism, must have been subject to the struggle of ruthlessness and arrogance, and throughout the history of arrogance they have always sought to oppose human values, justice, heavenly religions and divine prophets.
What is important to us today is the issue of support for the global arrogance of the Zionists in the region, support for the Takfiri and ISIS movements in the region, as well as broad support for all those who are plotting against Iran, and above all, Today, the US economic sanctions are, in fact, a key symbol of the global arrogance war with the Islamic revolution in the region.
Dashti reiterated: Americans have not been successful in all their struggles, and today, as we witness the events in Iraq and Lebanon, the main reason is the failure of Americans in the region to resist the formation of a resistance front. So, both faithfully, historically, and in terms of the current conditions of arrogance, it is determined to undermine the thinking of the Islamic Revolution in the region and to impede the independence of Islamic countries. This process fails, but events show that the Americans did not learn from their move. And they are still determined to oust the Islamic Revolution Front in the region.
""This is not the fate of this country to be associated with arrogance,"" he said, noting that the lessons we have learned from the forty years before the revolution are Americans, and that our lessons should not be linked to arrogance. The greatest achievement of all was that the Americans took every opportunity to attack the Islamic Revolution.
Dashti continued: ""Interaction for progress does not mean being dependent on America, and global interaction is actually a matter of our interest, but if this interaction is defined as without America and without progressive arrogance, revolutionary experimentation will not be possible."" Unlike Islam, this is where we have actually been waiting for the arrogant system to take action, where our progress has stopped, and where we have relied on young, devout, revolutionary and jihadist forces, just as we have in the defense and other industries such as energy. Nuclear and other fields and taking top positions in the Bo world Daim and all this has been done by disregarding the arrogant system.
He added: ""This very clear and happy experience should be applied in the economic field as well, relying on domestic capacities as well as highly qualified, believing and jihadist forces in the country, and today, after going through the peak of sanctions, it is actually entering. We are in the process of consolidating the country's economic system and starting to grow, and if we continue this process with greater effort and success, we will create a preventive action in the economic field such as defense and politics and the best conditions for global engagement. Where it is in Iran's interest, and behind every negotiating table It is in Iran's interest that the authorities will act with authority.
""It has been proven to us that global engagement is not really satisfying for the arrogant system, and many countries, such as Russia, China, are now separating their political and economic security from Europe, especially the United States,"" said Yazd's former deputy political security chief. And the pattern of success is taking shape, and everyone agrees that the era of regional and even global unilateralism, bullying, and globalization is on the decline, with new economic, cultural and political powers exemplifying Islamic Iran in the region. And there is no need to bring the fate of a country like Iran Link the demands of the arrogant system that is itself declining.
