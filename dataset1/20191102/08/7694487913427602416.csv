Hariri's resignation and Aoun lament .. Various readings!
02 Nov 2019, 08:00 by Lebanon 24
Under the headline: ""The Constitution is Between the Roles of Commissioning and Composing!"" Some members of the PA believed that the resignation had stalled a course aimed at ""taming"" the uprising to confront the crisis with the same government kit. The delay in conducting commissioning consultations was therefore interpreted as a means that might offset the time limit for authoring. So how can it? The readings of President Michel Aoun on the timing of binding parliamentary consultations differed as if the country were experiencing a period of prosperity. While some considered that President Aoun dealt with the entitlement to resign ""installment"" instead of being accused of ""underestimation"" at a stage that has reached all the possible ceilings, while those close to him considered that resorted to a lot of wisdom. The two sides met only on the grounds that the country was experiencing an extraordinary phase that would accommodate both theories. Therefore, mutual criticism and observations focused on Aoun's programmed separation of the constitutional stages that accompany such an event. It was a statement related to receiving the resigning president and receiving the letter of resignation and publication, and postponing the next phase of the mandate of the caretaker business before postponing the date of consultations on the nomination of his predecessor to form the new government. The Constitution did not specify how to deal with the situation resulting from the resignation and did not draw a road map on how to pass the successive stages in form and timing other than substance. Therefore, the assessment remained one of the President's personal tasks that do not go to anyone, such as when he issued decrees accepting the resignation of the government and the task of assigning the prime minister before he signed the decree of the new government formation. The constitution has nothing to do with it. The President is the only one who swore on the Constitution, pledging to respect and implement it and not to allow anyone to bypass it once it is proved. Therefore, the discussions moved to another place, accusing the President of procrastinating in determining the mechanism of confronting the constitutional development. But in order to fulfill their demands to form an independent and neutral government of technocrats seeking to manage a transitional phase begins by shortening the mandate of the House of Representatives and the development of a fair law on which to hold early parliamentary elections as a road map for which the Lebanese rose in the squares on the homeland of the most jinn B to the north and from the depth of Bakain to Beirut and Mount Lebanon.
