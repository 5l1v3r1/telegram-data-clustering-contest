02 Nov 2019, 08:19 by https://www.facebook.com/sunsportdesk

AFTER six weeks of thrilling rugby in Japan, we have reached the final as England play South Africa in Yokohama.

The Red Rose produced arguably their best ever performance to dispense with the All Blacks in the semi-final, while the Springboks squeezed the life out of Wales in a close fought win.
The match is a repeat of the sides' 2007 showpiece in Paris where South Africa ran out 15-6 winners.

England vs South Africa kicks off at 9am UK time - 11am in South Africa and 6pm in Japan.
All the action from Yokohama is live on ITV1 and ITV1 HD in the UK.
To stream the game live, head to the ITV Hub or create an account on TV Player.
