駱以軍《明朝》：我們都在明朝的變態裡生活
02 Nov 2019, 08:00 by Readmoo閱讀最前線


我們想讓你知道的是《明朝》一書展現了駱以軍對藝術品、古文書卷的痴戀，他把戀物心理投射於人情事理，甚至與歷史演變、社會百態等結合，並以工匠技藝隱喻一代人的心靈原形。



文：果子離
《明朝》，一般界定為科幻小說，駱以軍自己受訪說新書，也以科幻小說定位。但此書讀起來跟我們想像的科幻小說不太一樣。同樣的，因為書名，或許會被歸類於歷史小說，然而小說以明朝為引子，卻也不是歷史小說。
儘管有歷史，有科幻，《明朝》的底層，還是一部現實小說。
更進一步說，《明朝》是以過去、現在、未來為時代背景的小說，但也不是敘述過去、現在、未來的小說。這樣繞口令式的說辭，聽來令人迷糊，沒辦法啊，駱以軍的小說就是會讀得迷迷糊糊，彷彿走入繁盛迷宮、逛進歧路花園的炫目迷惑。思路太過清明，恐怕制約於常態，反而為其文字、意象所迷戀，而迷途。
《明朝》從某一角度來說，是未來的小說，但這裡說的未來，不是指故事所設定——被灌輸明朝事蹟的機器人，萬年後登陸於遙遠的星球，於其中開啟、複製這個朝代的文明圖卷。而是敘述者「我」所處的時空，是百年之後的台灣，那是河馬已絕種的未來。
但小說呈現的場景並沒有未來感，甚至於只是我們熟悉，充滿既視感的細節描繪，有的是駱以軍日常走動的路線圖，有的是他的生活錄像。《明朝》的現實軸線，循著私小說的軌跡運行，但要對號入座卻又貼合不密，曖曖昧昧，矇矇矓矓。
當然也不會是歷史小說。駱以軍像是一個富於魅力的說書人，有別於歷史學者的史觀，迥異於講史者的語氣，他自成一格，明代被他講述到讓人想找一本歷史書，好好讀這一段史事。只不過，教科書也好，《明史那些事兒》也罷，讀了之後對於理解《明朝》的明史部分，加分有限，因為引發駱以軍興趣並寫入書裡的，不只是帝王將相的豐功偉業或荒淫暴政等事蹟，不只是政治、軍事、經濟的發達或失序，而是藝術成就。
「明朝」計畫把它們拉到與皇帝朝政平起平坐，因此執行者「我」灌輸給機器人繁密龐大訊息庫的主題，包括山水畫的絕美意境，以及《金瓶梅》《儒林外史》《牡丹亭》《陶庵夢憶》等名著精華，文徵明、唐寅、仇英、李卓吾、徐渭等文化人的人文精神，讓人工智能內部建立文明心靈的深層模型，以便在太陽毀滅、人類滅絕之後，攜帶著復刻文明計畫，飛行萬年，降落在某個星球，重啟人類文明。
長篇小說《明朝》開展於一個提問：一個變態腐敗的政治環境，何以孕育出藝術的繁花盛景？明朝皇帝素質之低，是這片土地朝起朝落各朝各代之最。這支朱姓家族，集各種古怪、變態、瘋狂、縱慾於一身，足以供遺傳病理學研究之用。
然則寫明朝就好了，何以對映於泱泱大明，寫在小說裡的現實，是以私小說形式呈現的，狗皮倒灶的瑣事？
沒錯，明代固然幽暗、荒誕、變態、瘋狂，但人類哪個時代正常過？只是程度輕重之別罷了。說穿了，從古到今，社會型態不同，但人性不變，事物本質不變，變態鳥事滲透在世間每個角落。史書記載每多權力鬥爭，於今社會，不遑多讓，且與朝廷一樣明爭暗鬥、爾虞我詐的，豈止於政界、商場？職場圈、人情間，人事爭軋、名利爭奪，又何異於宮廷？此現象無所不在，錯綜複雜，就像小說這句：「局中局。謎中謎。戲中戲。」是以，小說採取多線敘述，與明朝這個大結構交錯並進，喬不定孰主孰副的，是頗富私小說味道的生活瑣事與文壇八卦。
亂七八糟的事一堆，今昔對應，虛實相生，這種手法散布全書各章節。譬如第十章寫性，以《金瓶梅》文本為引子，傳述性愛心理與生理的細緻感受和極致美感，與此交錯的是個人的性經驗，以及把玩壽山石時，在石頭上塗抹「杜蕾斯」潤滑油，觀之賞之、撫之摩之、搓之揉之的曖昧情色感。
壽山石，穿梭於許多段落之中，駱以軍把近幾年的新歡寫進小說裡。他從神像說起。從比真人兩三倍大的石壁鑿像，到廟宇香案供奉的木雕尺寸，神像隨時代愈來愈小，最後小至壽山石，在掌間把玩。小說寫道，將半天高的神靈，縮小到掌中把玩的羅漢手件，給我們一個啟示（這段寫得精闢，必須一字不漏抄錄下來）：「惟有人形微縮之形態的攜帶，是最全景、龐大、多維的可能。」
一如山水畫尺幅千里，想想看，如今隨處可見，媽祖公仔等小小吊飾，比壽山石觀音羅漢更迷你，而我們各式人種族群，不分宗教，無論心中有神或無神，皆手持手機，在指間觀看縮小無數倍的虛擬實境，不正是科技版的縮小操演？此現象寓有深意，不容等閒視之。
《明朝》一書展現了駱以軍對藝術品、古文書卷的痴戀，他把戀物心理投射於人情事理，甚至與歷史演變、社會百態等結合，並以工匠技藝隱喻一代人的心靈原形。在《荒人手記》《青蚨子》等作品亦可見這類物理學的寫作手法。在《明朝》裡，物，是跨越時空的媒介，把一物細部分解為一個個元素，再組合回來，原來的集合體就像一顆星球。小說裡出現多次「星球」一詞，卻不限於宇宙的日月星辰。在作者概念裡，同一種屬性連結而成的一群人，例如字與字綴聯的一本書，即是一個星球，以致有「戲子與婊子的星球」一詞。又如說到《本草綱目》，即定義為「全部以藥材組合而成的星球」。如此，大星球包容著小星球，小星球下又有更小的星球，一球一球，層層相扣，吾人所處的世界是由各圈子組成的，一個套一個，如俄羅斯娃娃。
《明朝》不好解讀，除了駱以軍一貫的，繁複如大腸包小腸以及意象跳躍如現代詩的句法，加上近幾年常在小說裡融入科幻元素、援引史事等手法，若未曾接觸科幻電影與小說，從《女兒》到《明朝》，讀來會更加吃力。雖然讀《明朝》，遇到維度、弦理論、膜、曲率引擎等詞可略過去；未讀過本書據以開展的文本——劉慈欣小說《三體》，一樣可以讀得下去，但真要清楚意旨，就不免被閱讀門檻絆腳。
更慘的是，本書校對不精，有的標點有上無下，像括弧（p.330），像引號（p.331），造成閱讀的困擾。又如：「他」誤為「她」（p.156）；折疊「以」上（折疊「椅」上）（p.321）等，都是會造成閱讀障礙的別字，而全書多處頓號與逗號混用，讓句法顯得更為繁複。
《明朝》的主題設定太精妙了，唯書中有些概念，如「人類的大腦是一台超級量子電腦」，或如「所以當初設計地球生命，乃至人類的那個更高等文明，確實比我們目前的『AI擴散』思考要高明太多。」等部分，若能進一步衍繹，就更精采了。

Luo Yijun, ""Ming Dynasty"": We all lived in the metamorphosis of the Ming Dynasty
02 Nov 2019, 08:00 by Readmoo reading the front line


What we want you to know is that the book ""Ming Dynasty"" shows Luo Yijun's obsession with art and ancient scrolls. He casts his fetish psychology on human affairs, even with historical evolution, social conditions, and craftsmen. The metaphor of the metaphor of a generation's mind.



Text: Fruit leave
""Ming Dynasty"" is generally defined as science fiction. Luo Yijun himself interviewed and said that the new book is also positioned in science fiction. But this book is not quite the same as the science fiction we imagined. Similarly, because the title of the book may be classified as a historical novel, the novel is based on the Ming Dynasty, but it is not a historical novel.
Despite the history and sci-fi, the bottom of the Ming Dynasty is still a realistic novel.
Furthermore, the Ming Dynasty is a novel based on the past, present and future, but it is not a novel that describes the past, present and future. This kind of tongue-and-mouth rhetoric sounds confusing, and there is no way. Luo Yijun’s novels will be read and stupid, as if walking into the maze of prosperity and dazzling into the garden of the road. The idea is too clear, I am afraid that it is restricted to the normal state, but it is obsessed with its words and images, and lost.
From a certain point of view, ""Ming Dynasty"" is a novel of the future, but the future mentioned here does not refer to the setting of the story - the robot that was instilled in the Ming Dynasty's deeds. After 10,000 years, it landed on a distant planet and opened and copied it. The civilization of this dynasty. It is the time and space in which the narrator ""I"" is. It is Taiwan after a hundred years, and that is the future of Hippo.
However, the scene presented by the novel does not have a sense of fuss, even if we are familiar with it, full of details of the sense of sight, some are Luo Yijun's daily road map, and some of his life videos. The realistic axis of the Ming Dynasty follows the trajectory of the private novel, but it must be close to the seat, but it is not close, ambiguous, and obscured.
Of course, it will not be a historical novel. Luo Yijun is like a fascinating storyteller. It is different from the history of historical scholars. It is different from the tone of the history writer. He is a self-contained person. He was told by the Ming Dynasty that he wanted to find a history book and read it well. This is a historical event. However, textbooks, ""the history of those things"" or after reading, for the understanding of the Ming Dynasty part of the Ming Dynasty, the extra points are limited, because the interest of Luo Yijun and written in the book, not only the emperor will Deeds such as Gong Weiye or ruthless tyranny are not only the development or disorder of politics, military and economy, but artistic achievements.
The ""Ming Dynasty"" plan pulled them to sit on the same level as the emperor's political affairs. Therefore, the performer ""I"" instilled the theme of the robot's dense and huge information base, including the beautiful artistic conception of landscape painting, and ""Jin Ping Mei"", ""The Scholars"" and ""Peony Pavilion"". ""The essence of famous works such as ""Tao Yu Meng Yi"", the cultural spirit of Wen Zhengming, Tang Yin, Qiu Ying, Li Zhuowu, Xu Wei and other cultural people, let the artificial intelligence build a deep model of the civilized mind, so that after the sun is destroyed and humans are extinct, carry Re-enacting civilized plans, flying for 10,000 years, landing on a certain planet, restarting human civilization.
The novel ""Ming Dynasty"" was carried out in a question: What is the political environment of perverted corruption, and why did it breed the flourishing scenery of art? The low quality of the emperor of the Ming Dynasty is the highest of all generations of this land. This family of Zhu surnamed, all kinds of weird, perverted, crazy, indulgent, enough for genetic pathology research.
However, it is better to write the Ming Dynasty. Why is it reflected in the big picture of the Ming Dynasty, written in the novel, in the form of a private novel, the trivial matter of the dog skin?
Yes, the Ming Dynasty is dark, absurd, perverted, and crazy, but which era of human beings is normal? It’s just a matter of degree. To put it bluntly, from ancient times to today, social forms are different, but human nature is unchanged, the nature of things is unchanged, and perverted birds are infiltrated in every corner of the world. The history books record that every power struggle, in today's society, does not give more to it, and it is as intriguing as the court, and it is intriguing to the political circles and shopping malls. What is different from the court in the workplace, in the human condition, in the competition for personnel, and in fame and fortune? This phenomenon is omnipresent and intricate, just like the novel: ""The bureau in the game. The mystery in the mystery. The drama in the drama."" Yes, the novel adopts a multi-line narrative, and it is intertwined with the big structure of the Ming Dynasty. Joe is uncertain. It is a trivial matter of life and a gossip of the literary world.
A mess of things, the past and the present, the real and the false, this method spreads the chapters of the book. For example, in the tenth chapter, the text of ""Jin Ping Mei"" is used as a primer to narrate the delicate feelings and extreme beauty of sexual psychology and physiology. This is intertwined with personal sexual experience. When playing Shoushan Stone, apply ""Duleis"" lubrication on the stone. The sensation of the oil, the appreciation of the statue, the care of the Mo, the sorrow of the sorrow.
Shoushan Stone, shuttled through many passages, Luo Yijun wrote new love in recent years into the novel. He started from the image of the god. From the stone wall that is two or three times larger than the real person, to the size of the woodcarvings enshrined in the temple incense, the statues are getting smaller and smaller at any time. Finally, they are small to the Shoushan Stone and play in the palm. The novel writes that the half-day-high god is narrowed down to the hand of the Luohan in the palm of the hand, giving us a revelation (this paragraph is incisive and must be transcribed without a word): ""Only the shape of the human form is the most Panoramic, huge, multi-dimensional possibilities.""
Just like a landscape painting, you can see it everywhere. Nowadays, the little charms such as Mazu figurine are even smaller than the Shoushan Shiguanyin Luohan, and we have various ethnic groups, regardless of religion, no matter whether there is god or no god in the heart. All of them are hand-held mobile phones, and it is not the technical version of the reduced performance to watch the virtual reality of reducing the number of times in the fingers. This phenomenon has profound meaning and cannot be ignored.
The book ""Ming Dynasty"" shows Luo Yijun's obsession with art and ancient scrolls. He casts his fetish psychology on human affairs, even combines with historical evolution and social conditions, and metaphorizes the spiritual prototype of a generation with craftsmanship. . Such physics writing techniques can also be seen in works such as The Wild Man's Handwriting and The Green Scorpion. In the Ming Dynasty, things are the medium that transcends time and space. They solve a subtle part as a single element, and then combine it back. The original assembly is like a planet. There are many words of ""star"" in the novel, but not limited to the sun, the moon and the stars of the universe. In the author's concept, a group of people connected by the same attribute, such as a book with words and affixes, is a planet, so that there is the word ""the planet of the play and the scorpion."" Another example is the ""Compendium of Materia Medica"", which is defined as ""a planet composed entirely of medicinal materials."" In this way, the big planet contains small planets, and there are smaller planets under the small planet. One ball and one ball are interlocked. The world we live in is composed of circles, one set, such as Russian dolls.
""Ming Dynasty"" is not easy to interpret, except for Luo Yijun's consistent, complex such as the large intestine package small intestine and image jumping like the syntax of modern poetry, plus in recent years, often incorporate sci-fi elements in the novel, citing historical events, etc., if you have not touched science fiction Movies and novels, from ""Daughter"" to ""Ming Dynasty"", will be more difficult to read. Although reading the Ming Dynasty, the words such as dimension, string theory, membrane, and curvature engine can be skipped; the text that Liu Wenxin’s novel ""Three-body"" has been read without reading the book can be read, but true. To be clear, you can't help but be read.
Worse still, the book is not perfect, some punctuation has no upper and lower, like brackets (p.330), like quotes (p.331), causing reading troubles. Another example is that ""he"" is mistaken for ""her"" (p. 156); folding ""by"" (folding on ""chair"") (p. 321), etc., are all words that cause dyslexia, and there are many books in the book. Mixing numbers with commas makes the syntax more complicated.
The theme of ""Ming Dynasty"" is too subtle. There are some concepts in the book, such as ""The human brain is a super quantum computer"", or ""So the higher civilization that designed the life of the earth and even human beings is indeed better than us. The current ""AI diffusion"" thinking should be too much."" If you can further expand, it will be even more brilliant.
