      <p>A machete-wielding brute high on cocaine and Buckfast hacked into a man’s head in a Paisley street.</p>
      <p>Frank Duffy, 44, was high on booze and drugs when he launched his blade attack on Robert Lawson in broad daylight.</p>
      <p>Footage of the attack – captured on a mobile phone – showed Duffy swinging the large blade at Mr Lawson’s head, shoulder and hands as horrified neighbours screamed at him to stop.</p>

      <p>Paisley Sheriff Court was shown a video clip of the attack, which took place in Morven Avenue, Glenburn.</p>
      <p>Shocked neighbours are heard repeatedly shouting at Duffy to “Get to f***” and to “Stop” as he launched the frenzied assault.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Keri Marshall said: “The footage shows the accused attacking the complainer with a large knife, which he is waving in an overhead chopping motion, striking the complainer several times as he did so.</p>
      <p>“Police also received anonymous reports the person responsible for the assault was named as Frank Duffy.”</p>
      <p>Duffy, of Morven Avenue, pleaded guilty to assaulting Mr Lawson to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement during the incident on August 3, last year.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>His injuries included a gash to the back of his head that needed seven stitches, a chip to his collarbone and scarring on his left hand.</p>
      <p>Defence agent Eamon McGeehan told the court Duffy targeted Lawson for an earlier attack on his friend, a witness named as Mr Mason.</p>
      <p>Mr McGeehan said: “He had consumed Buckfast and cocaine and has no memory of the incident.</p>
      <p>“His recollection extends no further than beyond his friend returning to the house and complaining of having been assaulted.</p>
      <p>“It appears he had taken it upon himself to exact some kind of revenge upon the complainer, the complainer having been involved in an incident with the friend of Mr Duffy.”</p>
      <p>The lawyer added that Duffy was forced to flee Paisley following the incident amid fear of “reprisals”.</p>

      <p>Sheriff Seith Ireland told the thug: “It was quite shocking, the level of your behaviour, while using a knife, to leave him with severe injury and permanent disfigurement.</p>
      <p>“You are out of control when too much drugs have been taken.</p>
      <p>“Given your previous conduct, you still present a serious risk of further offending.”</p>
      <p>He jailed Duffy for 18 months and ordered he be supervised by the authorities on his release for nine months.</p>
