      <p>With tributes to the Springboks pouring in from various PSL clubs and players, AmaZulu may have sent the best message of support yet. Check it out!</p>
      <p>During the week, coach Pitso Mosimane and Steve Komphela showed their support of the Bokke's game against England in the final of the 2019 Rugby World Cup, and took to their social media handles in doing so.</p>
      <p>Clubs such as Cape Town City and SuperSport United followed suit, taking to their social platforms to send messages of encouragement to the SA rugby team.</p>
