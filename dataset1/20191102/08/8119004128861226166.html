        <b>Malaysia says no to an offer from Goldman Sachs of less than $2 billion in compensation over the 1MDB scandal</b>
      </p>
      <p>Malaysia has rejected an offer from Goldman Sachs of less than $2 billion in compensation over the 1MDB scandal, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told the Financial Times on Friday, compared with its publicly stated demand of $7.5 billion.</p>
      <p>The Southeast Asian nation has charged Goldman and 17 current and former directors of its units for allegedly misleading investors over bond sales totalling $6.5 billion that the U.S. bank helped raise for sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).</p>
      <p>“Goldman Sachs has offered something like less than $2 billion,” Mahathir told the newspaper. “We are not satisfied with that amount so we are still talking to them...If they respond reasonably we might not insist on getting that $7.5 billion”.</p>
      <p>Goldman declined to comment to the FT. The bank did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Goldman said last month it was in discussions with authorities on the possibility of a resolution of investigations relating to 1MDB.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Mahathir travelling with the leader could not immediately be reached.</p>
      <p>US authorities say about $4.5 billion was siphoned from 1MDB, founded in 2009 by then-Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. The scandal helped Mahathir hand a surprise defeat to Najib in a general election last year.</p>
      <p>Mahathir told the FT the Southeast Asian country was not negotiating or in contact with fugitive financier Jho Low, accused of playing a central role in the scam.</p>
      <p>Low has consistently denied wrongdoing and says he does not expect a fair trial in Malaysia as long as Mahathir is in power.</p>
      <p>The US Justice Department said this week it had struck a deal to recover $1 billion in funds allegedly looted from 1MDB from Low, in a record haul for a US anti-corruption probe.</p>
      <p>The deal does not include an admission of guilt or wrongdoing and is not tied to criminal action against Low.</p>
      <p>Mahathir said on Thursday Malaysia would file a claim on Low’s forfeited assets.</p>
      <p>“The DoJ has indicated that if we can prove claim of ownership, then we will be able to get the money for ourselves,” Mahathir told the FT.</p>
