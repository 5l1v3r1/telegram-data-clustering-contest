為了2020總統及立委選情，國民黨主席吳敦義今（2日）上午先到台南替洪秀柱站台，下午再跑到新北參加造勢活動。不過有媒體拍攝到他受訪時，雙眼無神、身體搖晃、無法回應記者提問，隨後被隨扈攙扶離開，經過休息後，他上台致詞坦言，剛剛在餐會喝多了。
綜合媒體報導，吳敦義今日上午前往台南替洪秀柱造勢，受訪時還中氣十足地多次喊出，總統大選、立委選舉「通通要打贏」；接著中午又出席北部退休將領活動，替國民黨和韓國瑜拉票；不過就在稍早出席新北造勢場驚傳身體不適。
吳敦義下午到新北林口區為立法委員參選人洪孟楷站台，約14時30分抵達會場，下車接受媒體訪問，被問到不分區名單問題時，吳敦義疑因身體不適，面無表情、兩眼直緊盯記者，卻完全無法做任何回應，甚至身體一度前後搖晃，需要人攙扶才能穩住，隨即被隨扈扶進競選總部休息。
約10分鐘後吳敦義才緩緩步入會場，他上台致詞語速緩慢，提及方先前的插曲，解釋自己喝多了，「今天喝了不少的酒，但是我知道這是場非常重要的聚會，洪孟楷是我們中國國民黨的寶貝，我們一定要讓他當選。」一旁的前台北縣長周錫瑋也為吳緩頰，「主席剛剛與500位退役將領聚餐，為國民黨爭取支持，相當辛苦。」
