02 Nov 2019, 08:00 by Іванка ЧАБАНЮК

У вихідний маємо трішки більше часу для кулінарії. Тож, сьогодні можна експериментувати.
Пропонуємо вам приготувати смачну страву, яка подарує хороші емоції на весь день.  

Потрібно:

гарбуз — 200 г
борошно — 100 г
яйця — 2 штуки
цукор — 60 г
розпушувач — 10 г
кориця, ваніль, вершкове масло — за смаком

Гарбуз почистьте та наріжте. Зваріть до готовності. Потім гарбуз остудіть і перетріть в блендері.
Збийте яйця з цукром, а потім додайте гарбузове пюре, просіяне борошно і розпушувач. Добре перемішайте.
Маслом змажте форми для кексів і заповніть їх гарбузовим тістом на 3/4. Відправте у духовку та випікайте при 180 градусах 20-25 хвилин.
Готовність гарбузових мафінів перевіряйте зубочисткою: занурте її в тісто, якщо  вона буде сухою, значить кекси готові.

Racism and AfD
Christkind is not blonde enough: the arrow into the heart of the AFD soul
02 Nov 2019, 08:08 by Katja Thorwarth

Another proof of how the AfD is ticking is in the cause of the Nuremberg Christ Child. A comment.

Actually, it would have needed no proof that the AfD is a party that has found salvation in folk music. Its political agenda is focused on the nation-state, which focuses on those who are rooted in the blood-and-soil sense for generations in the home marker. And they are, they would probably like it at the AfD, knows.
AfD and the hated multiculturalism
It is therefore no coincidence that the permanent connection with the Teutons, the desire for a strong Germany, which may find its way back to the old masculinity and Germanic spirit of attack. It is just the counter-model to the existing real multicultural society, this hated left-vicious veil, which calls the AfD in his election pamphlet as a core requirement. Accordingly, the basic program formulates a commitment to the ""German Leitkultur"" - whatever that may be -, whereas ""the ideology of multiculturalism ... is regarded as a serious threat to social peace and to the survival of the nation as a cultural entity"".
In the run-up to Christmas, the fight for the most German Germany since 1933 is particularly laborious. Everywhere lurks the threat, be it in homosexual Zipfelmänner (instead of Nicholas), be it in the winter market (instead of Christmas market) or be it in colorful Christmas cookies instead of brown - everywhere it is repressed, the Western culture, sacrificed on the altar of do-gooders.
Nuremberg has a new Christ child
The arrow into the heart of the AFD soul, however, recently occurred in Nuremberg. Ironically, in the city of the Nazi Party Rallies, a dark-haired student was named New Christ Child. It is not called Annegret Deutschländer, but Benigna Munsi.
""Nuremberg has a new Christ child. One day we feel like the Indians "", the AfD Kreisverband München-Land made impressively ridiculous. ""Us"", that is to say, blood and soil Germans, is soon going to be like the ""Indians? Are we about 17-year-old students locked in reservations? Are we selling blatant liquor that the last pure German brain cell says goodbye to Nirvana?
The fear seems to sit deep, one looks into the social networks: ""A Christ child has blond curls,"" rages about it on the Facebook page ""Our Germany - patriotic and free"". Or ""to puke"", ""Soon also the Christkind renamed"" etc.pp. Lots of posts by racists who turn on the folkish wheel and are very likely to choose the AfD.
Nuremberg and the Christ Child - AfD-Supergau
Fits, as well as the opinion contribution of Hardy Rupsch, IT editor with the AFD parliamentary group in the Bundestag. ""A Christ child, to whom one can view the foreign origin at the tip of the nose, is a slap in the face of all friends of tradition and grown culture."" Previously, he had mused on the ""many forms of existence"" of a ""Jesus Christ"" and resigned noted, that ""Christkindl ... has been female for a long time"". This, of course, is the maximum penalty of occupying a post as a woman who is actually intended for the man, and not even, if so, with the proper hairstyle.
The number is for a party that constantly claims to be non-racist, the Supergau - especially since they rushes unashamedly against a 17-year-old, although the child's welfare has alleged priority. Reminiscent of Carsten Härle of the AfD Heusenstamm, who in 2017 worked on a student, who got a prize for civil courage.
Meanwhile, at least the Munich district association back rowing, which obviously has not expected this resistance in the social networks. Now supposedly had an ""editor"" on their side other ideas of a ""Christ child"", but had resigned immediately and did not want to offend anyone. That he did not want to insult anyone, may even tackle. That this ""does not correspond to the values of the AfD"", however, is gross nonsense. Rather, it is party agenda.
This from brown to blue repainted does not work, they should take notice of the AfD.
