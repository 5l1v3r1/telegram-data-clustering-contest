      <p>After consulting footage and speaking with Perez and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/Racing-point">Racing Point</a> the stewards made their decision to give the Mexican the mandatory pitlane start.</p>
      <p><i>“The Stewards reviewed video evidence and heard from the driver of car 11 (Sergio Perez) and the team representative and determined that the driver failed to stop for weighing when required to do so," </i>a statement read.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Instead, he drove on and proceeded to do a pit stop where the car was worked on by lifting the car and all four wheels were changed, in breach of Article 29.1 a). </i>
