The merger between PSA and FCA, a success of the Agnelli
The Italian family becomes the great beneficiary of the merger of Fiat and Peugeot, as it increases its wealth and maintains its shares of power in the resulting new group

Finally, the Italian-American group FCA (Fiat Chrysler Automobile) will not be merged with Renault, but with another French manufacturer, PSA - brand of the Peugeot, Opel, Citroën and DS brands - in an equals operation, since the shareholders of both Companies will have 50% of the resulting new entity.
The giant resulting from this merger becomes the fourth manufacturer in the world in volume of car manufacturers (about 8.7 million cars in 2018) and total revenues of almost 170,000 million euros.

Peugeot-Fiat: a fusion almost forced by the challenges of the sector

The first executive director of this giant, based in the Netherlands, will be the current CEO of PSA, the Portuguese-born Frenchman Carlos Tavares, who will preside over a five-member meeting with five more members from the group during the first five years. FCA and five more from the PSA group.
One of the most controversial aspects of the merger will be the closure of factories or the reduction of personnel, since the French State owns 12% of the PSA group and wants to ensure all jobs in French territory, and in The joint statement both companies underlined that ""as a result of the transaction there will be no factory closure.""
This merger is the result of the industrial conversion process caused by the appearance of the electric car and the new forms of electric and shared mobility, a field where the Italian-American group is lagging behind most of the major manufacturers. In this sense, the PSA group already has an electric modular platform that uses the electric versions of the new Opel Corsa and Peugeot 208, and that other brands of the group such as Citroën or DS will soon be used.
From this point of view, the FCA group could benefit from the merger, but we must not forget that the Italian-American group has some highly attractive assets for any manufacturer, such as a well-implemented commercial network in the United States and Europe. the Jeep brand, the jewel of the group's crown.
The Agnelli, the great beneficiaries
The Agnelli family is the great beneficiary of the merger between the two major groups, since the value of the investment fund of the Italian family clan, Exor, has increased its value above 800 million euros from the moment of the "" announcement of the merger, according to Bloomberg. In addition, Exor will control 14% of the new company resulting from the merger and will become the reference shareholder of the new group. And all this without compromising the Ferrari and Maserati brands, separated from the rest of the Fiat group a few years ago and that the Agnelli keep them under absolute control.
Apart from this shareholder control, Exor will receive about 5,800 million euros of its current investment to the FCA group through a special dividend from its Comau industrial automation business before the two companies formalize the merger, which will still decrease plus the financial participation of Exor and FCA to the resulting new group. Some 1,600 of the 5,800 million euros of this special dividend will go directly to the pocket of the Agnelli family, led by John Elkann, who has followed the strategy designed by Sergio Marchionne months before his death.

The generosity of the PSA group, a group controlled by the French state, the Peugeot family and the Chinese manufacturer Dongfeng Motor, has a reason to be. Apart from being able to land with a solid base in the United States and Canada thanks to the commercial network of FCA, the new group can be a saving of more than 3.7 billion euros per year in financial costs and up to 6,000 million euros Euros in various tax rates over the next four years.
