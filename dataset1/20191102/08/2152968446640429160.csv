Russia does not yet believe that Al Baghdadi has been killed
Lavrov said the Russian military did not have such information
02 Nov 2019, 08:00 by Nelly Hristova
Russia's military cannot yet confirm the death of Islamic State terrorist leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, quoted by TASS.
Lavrov said this in an interview on Russia 24 TV. The foreign minister noted that the Russian military was investigating additional facts related to information released by the US about the death of al-Baghdadi.
""The Russian Ministry of Defense has already commented on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. We want to get further information. Everything was announced in a solemn and jubilant style, but our military is still investigating additional facts and cannot confirm much of what ""The liquidation of terrorists, if it really happened, is, I suppose, a positive step,"" the minister said.
US President Donald Trump announced the liquidation of Islamic State leader on October 27, BTA recalls. Trump said al-Baghdadi was killed in a special operation by US forces in the Syrian province of Idlib. The Russian Defense Ministry said it did not have reliable information on Al Baghdadi's death. The international community has identified its liquidation as an important but not a decisive step in the fight against terrorism.
