Viewers of The Chase were left scratching their heads on Friday night - after Bradley Walsh made a frankly bizarre error.
The host of the ITV1 daytime favourite was presenting the quiz show on Friday, November 1.
The episode - the final instalment of the five-day working week - left viewers baffled, though.
Twitter and Facebook were awash with comments after Bradley made an odd - and out of character - gaffe.
The former Coronation Street star was welcoming four contestants onto the show, including Jackie.
The 67-year-old, from the Isle of Wight, was on the show in a bid to land a life-changing sum of money.

But it wasn't her going head to head with the Chaser that anybody was talking about.
No, in fact, Bradley left the restaurateur - and viewers - stunned after asking what she would spend the prize money on if she won a huge fund.
Jackie said she would like to see her sister in Canada.
 
Bradley replied: ""We'll get you to Canadia"".
""I’m sorry Bradley but we can’t accept Canadia. The correct answer is Canada,"" one viewer joked.
Another asked Bradley whether he was ""OK"", and another simply asked: ""Really Bradley?""
 
""Lmao"", another wrote.
And a fellow viewer questioned: ""Why did Bradley just call it ""Canadia?""
