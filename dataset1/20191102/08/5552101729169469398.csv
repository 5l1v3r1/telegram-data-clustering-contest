【台三線藝術季3-1】橫跨5大縣市　綿延150公里的秋日浪漫旅行
02 Nov 2019, 08:57 by 游琁如, 胡耀仁
浪漫台三線藝術季，是台灣近年來橫跨最多縣市，長度最長，觸及鄉鎮最多的藝術季。長150公里，縱貫台灣西北部的公路，串上五大縣市，數十個客家村莊的祭典，在秋風吹起之季展開。結合先人與今世的傳承，也講述了台灣的開發史故事。
苗栗大湖旁的大窩，有少見的穿龍圳水田景觀。客家拓墾者陳履獻手鑿穿龍圳灌溉梯田，穿龍為古字穿「窿」諧音，客家語中「鑿洞」之意。過去曾因開墾而導致原住民與漢族衝突不斷，直至泰雅族公主雅優與陳履獻的聯姻，才得以和平共存。
順著水流走入過往灌溉梯田使用的穿龍圳，隨著水深幾乎及膝，眼前一片幽暗。水圳兩側保留舊時鑿痕，岩壁上可見過去放置蠟燭之凹槽，僅容一人可通過的窄小岩壁，訴說了客家人開墾的不易與歷史。


僅容一人通過的水圳，已經是當地大型的水圳了，牆上可建蠟燭放置孔。



手鑿岩壁引水，是困難的舊時工程。

以此為背景，在大窩三連潭旁側，由花蓮港口部落藝術家伊祐噶照打造的《生命的鑿痕》，使用台灣柳杉，以木片堆疊象徵古圳鑿痕，整件作品外觀宛如種子，落在土地上，代表先人用汗水及雙手鑿出生命，並穿透層層考驗。


伊祐噶照擅長用作品傳達對環境的關懷。



兩萬片木板拼出的作品，內部可以見到接痕。

大窩伯公廟前的老樹下，有安聖惠的《編織記憶》。伯公廟與百年大樹下，她用棉繩細密編織出白色的網，網是家也是記憶。棉網可坐臥休憩，在輕風吹拂間，聆聽客家古調，還可以以嗅覺為主體，理解在地產香氣，自製專屬精油，以及品嚐客家傳統米食牛汶水，將客家記憶自我編織，更是柔情。


百年大樹下，全白色的《編織記憶》，是居民閒談與交流的空間。



坐在白色網中，聽一場山林音樂，似夢似醒。



調香師Ally在五感體驗中使用在地產樟腦與香茅，調出自己的配方。



自製的滾珠精油，每個人有不同的味道。



客家傳統米食牛汶水沒有包餡，用野薑花當湯底，紅色是紅龍果、黃為薑黃，中間凹洞是裝糖水處。

這塊土地上，還有范承宗用稻草與台灣木材打造出的《茶窩》。茶窩以在地「茶壽」為主軸，茶壽是苗栗汶水獨有的茶壺保溫方式，過去保溫設備不如今日，故用稻草編織出如鳥巢般的茶窩，用以保溫熱茶。如今此項手工藝逐漸消失，范承宗將此工藝用大尺寸重建。大小各一的茶窩，在山林中依存，也象徵親子關係的相互與獨立。


在山林之間的茶窩，圓形似蛹。



坐在茶窩中，范承宗說要大夥幻想自己是茶葉，在水中滾動。

竹林裡，有在地藝術家翁已涵與大窩山居民共同製作的陶杯作品，陶杯作品不只展示，也表現了客家的「奉茶」文化。型態各異的陶杯安靜立於白沙之上。白沙上的流水痕跡，象徵了開墾水圳的古水流動。真實與虛幻的水同存於空間之中。


竹林裡的白沙像水般流動於林中。



藍白色陶杯表現了客家的奉茶文化。

於竹林旁側，可以一邊品茶一邊體驗手作陶，利用簡單模板打造出魚型製筷架，製作過程中，整座山林只有流水與鳥蟲鳴，翁已涵說，人與自然安靜之中互動，各有生存相處之道，這是大自然的寧靜力量。


五感體驗可以在竹林前方親手製作魚狀筷架。



燒製完成的筷架，姿態很可愛。

[Taiwan three-line art season 3-1] across five major counties and cities, 150 km of autumn, romantic travel
02 Nov 2019, 08:57 by You Ruru, Hu Yaoren
The romantic three-line art season is the art season in which Taiwan has crossed the most counties and cities in recent years, with the longest length and the largest number of towns and towns. It is 150 kilometers long, runs through the highways in northwestern Taiwan, and is lined up in five major counties and cities. The festivals of dozens of Hakka villages are launched in the autumn season. Combining the inheritance of the ancestors and the present world, it also tells the story of Taiwan's development history.
In the large nest next to the Miaoli Great Lake, there is a rare view of the Longzhen paddy field. The Hakka Tudor Chen Luxian hand-chiseled through the Longzhen irrigation terraces, wearing dragons for the ancient characters to wear ""窿"" homophonic, Hakka language ""holes"" meaning. In the past, due to the opening up, the conflict between the aborigines and the Han people continued until the marriage of the Atayal Princess Yayou and Chen Lixian was able to coexist peacefully.
Walking through the water, the dragons used in the past irrigation terraces, with the water depth almost knee-high, the eyes are dark. The old sides of the water and the moon are kept in the old time. The grooves on the rock wall can be seen in the past, and only the narrow rock wall that one person can pass through tells the story of the easiness and history of the Hakka people.


The water mill that only allows one person to pass is already a large local water mill. Candles can be placed on the wall.



Hand-drilling the wall to divert water is a difficult old-time project.

Against this background, on the side of Dawo Sanliantan, the ""Scratch of Life"" created by the Hualien port tribe artist Yi Youshao, using Taiwanese cedar, symbolizes the ancient chiseling with wood chips stacked, the whole work looks like The seeds, which fall on the land, represent the ancestors with sweat and hands to cut out life and penetrate the layers of the test.


Ikesuke is good at using the work to convey care for the environment.



The works of 20,000 pieces of wood can be seen inside.

Under the old tree in front of the Dawo Bogong Temple, there is An Shenghui’s Weaving Memory. Under the Bogong Temple and the 100-year-old tree, she used a cotton rope to finely weave a white net. The net is home and memory. The cotton net can sit and rest, listen to the Hakka ancient tune in the light breeze, and also take the sense of smell as the main body, understand the aroma of the real estate, make exclusive essential oils, and taste the Hakka traditional rice and cattle, and weave the Hakka memories. It is tenderness.


Under the centuries-old tree, the all-white ""woven memory"" is the space for residents to chat and communicate.



Sitting in the white net, listening to a mountain music, it seems like a dream.



The perfumer Ally uses the real estate camphor and lemongrass in the five senses experience to bring out his own formula.



Homemade ball oil, each has a different taste.



Hakka traditional rice cattle and cattle water is not stuffed, with wild ginger flowers as the bottom of the soup, red is red dragon fruit, yellow is turmeric, and the middle cavity is filled with sugar.

On this land, there is also the ""Tea Nest"" created by Fan Chengzong with straw and Taiwanese wood. The tea nest is based on the local ""tea life"". Tea life is the unique teapot insulation method of Miaoli Wenshui. In the past, the insulation equipment was not used today, so the straw nest-like tea nest was weaved with straw to keep warm tea. Today, this craft is gradually disappearing, and Fan Chengzong reconstructs the process with large size. Tea pots of different sizes are dependent on the mountains and forests, which also symbolize the mutual and independent relationship between parents and children.


In the tea nest between the mountains, the circle is like a dragonfly.



Sitting in the tea nest, Fan Chengzong said that everyone wants to imagine that they are tea and roll in the water.

In the bamboo forest, there is a pottery cup work jointly produced by the local artist Wen Hanhan and Dawoshan residents. The pottery cup works not only display, but also express the Hakka tea culture. Different types of pottery cups stand quietly on the white sand. The traces of water on the white sand symbolize the flow of ancient water in Kaishui. Real and illusory water coexist in space.


The white sand in the bamboo forest flows like water in the forest.



The blue-and-white pottery cup represents the Hakka culture of the Hakka.

On the side of Zhulin, you can enjoy hand-made pottery while tea, and use a simple template to create a fish-shaped chopsticks. During the production process, there is only water and birds in the whole forest. Weng Hanhan said that people and nature are quiet. In the interaction, each has the way to live together, this is the tranquil power of nature.


Five senses experience can be made in front of the bamboo forest to make fish-shaped chopsticks.



The chopsticks frame that has been fired is very cute.
