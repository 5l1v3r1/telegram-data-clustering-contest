МИД Украины вызвал посла Франции из-за слов Макрона об украинских мигрантах

02 Nov 2019, 08:55

Министерство иностранных дел Украины вызвало посла Франции из-за цитаты президента этой страны Эмманюэля Макрона об украинских гражданах, которая появились в СМИ, сообщается на сайте ведомства.
О какой именно публикации идет речь, не уточняется, но 30 октября господин Макрон дал интервью журналу Valeurs Actuelles по проблемам миграции, в котором заявил, что Франция готова заполнять пустые квоты, но законными мигрантами. Он сказал фразу о том, что предпочитает легальных мигрантов из Гвинеи или Кот-д'Ивуара болгарским или украинским нелегалам (цитата опубликована на сайте газеты Liberasion, полного текста интервью в открытом доступе нет).
Посол Франции заявил, что никаких претензий к украинским гражданам у французских властей нет. «Следовательно, слова Э. Макрона по проблем миграции и законного трудоустройства были вырваны из контекста»,— заявили в МИД Украины. В сообщении также говорится, что Киев и Париж подтвердили намерение и дальше сотрудничать по вопросам миграции.
Напомним, в апреле Эмманюэль Макрон выступил за уменьшение шенгенской зоны. Он предложил исключить страны, которые не принимают мигрантов и уделяют недостаточное внимание безопасности границ. По мнению президента Франции, нынешняя зона уже не работает.

Can we really defend ourselves from natural disasters?
Japan has been trying for years and is investing heavily in infrastructure, but as the case of typhoon Hagibis shows it is not always enough

02 Nov 2019, 08:00

Between 12 and 13 October Japan was hit by typhoon Hagibis, one of the strongest ever to fall on the country. The typhoon, whose winds also exceeded 260 km / h in some moments, caused the flooding of several rivers, which flooded large residential areas, left half a million homes without electricity, and caused the death of at least 80 people. The area with the most victims was Fukushima, but there was also a lot of damage in Nakano and Nagano, north-west of Tokyo, where the banks of the Chikuma river collapsed and the water reached the streets by two meters of height.
The bank of the Chikuma river is just one of the 55 that typhoon Hagibis brought down with its passage: all built to withstand major floods, yet ineffective. Japan has a long history of devastating weather events, and over the years it has invested a great deal of money in infrastructure and technology to prevent new such events. As the case of the typhoon Hagibis shows, however, these efforts do not always serve for something, and both for Japan and for the rest of the world: one wonders then if we can really defend ourselves from natural disasters, especially when climate change is generating atmospheric events of unpredictable magnitude.
The New York Times has recently written about it, which has tried to understand why the efforts of the Japanese government have turned out to be useless in the face of the floods caused by Hagibis, and what the alternatives could be in the case of similar events in the future. Yasuo Nihei, a professor of fluvial engineering at the Tokyo University of Science, said that in different areas of Japan we are witnessing ""rains of an intensity that had never been seen before. If we take the costs into account, I believe it is clear that flood control programs should be accelerated. "" Yet, added Nihei, ""realistically, there will be rains from which we cannot defend ourselves"". Japan has been investing for years in the search for solutions that can counteract potentially more disastrous atmospheric events, starting with earthquakes and typhoons. In 1958, after typhoon Ida killed more than 1,200 people, the government decided to prevent any such new events by reinforcing the banks of many rivers across the country and cementing the beds in some cases.
These large infrastructural investments contributed to the growth of Japanese public debt, but today one wonders if it makes sense to invest further or if instead it is better to think of alternative solutions. Shiro Maeno, professor of hydraulic engineering at the University of Okayama, believes that the systems adopted so far are insufficient to deal with possible increasingly intense natural disasters: ""At present, a flood could occur anywhere, at any time. In the last few years things have begun to occur that we had never considered "".
The biggest problem, according to Daniel Aldrich, a professor of political science at Northeastern University in Boston and an expert in emergency management, is that investment in infrastructure generates in the population a false sense of security that places a solution that would be more effective in the background in certain situations: evacuation. «Why run away when there is a system that protects you? Why move to another place? ""Said Aldrich, who explained how, however, climate change is now shifting the attention from engineering interventions to"" soft measures "", such as the evacuation plans.
In this regard, in 2017 the Japanese government amended the current legislation on preparation for disastrous weather events, so as to minimize the number of deaths caused by the failed evacuation. With the new legislation, local administrations will have to prepare for the arrival of much rarer but potentially much more devastating events. To understand the difference between the old legislation and the new one, the New York Times gives the example of the evacuation plan of the city of Naganuma, one of the most affected by the typhoon Habigibis: first it predicted that in case of flood the waters could have submerged the city up to about 5 meters, while the new plan foresees that the water can even reach almost 20 meters.
The fact that much more disastrous events may occur than in the past raises the question of whether it is still useful or not to invest in infrastructure. This is especially true of small cities like Naganuma, with little money available, so the best solution to natural disasters is to instruct the population to evacuate as soon as possible. ""We need to get used to the idea that no matter what infrastructure there is, a flood will come from which we will not be able to defend ourselves,"" said Hiroki Okamoto, head of the management of the Chikuma River.
