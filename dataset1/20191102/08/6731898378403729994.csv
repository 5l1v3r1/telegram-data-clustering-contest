02 Nov 2019, 08:21 by Bola.net
Bola.net - Bomber Real Madrid, Luka Jovic mengungkapkan betapa kerasnya kritik yang ia dapatkan selama beberapa bulan pertamanya menjadi penggawa Los Blancos.
Ketajaman Jovic bersama Eintracht Frankfurt membuat Real Madrid kepincut untuk memboyongnya pada musim panas kemarin. Tak tanggung-tanggung, Los Blancos sampai rela menggelontorkan dana 60 juta euro demi mendapatkan tanda tangannya.
Namun Jovic belum mampu menjawab ekspektasi publik terhadap dirinya. Bomber 21 tahun itu pun mulai diragukan kualitasnya, jika dilihat dari penampilannya hingga sejauh ini.

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - General Chair of PSSI 2019-2023, Mochamad Iriawan alias Iwan Bule, said his success in winning a majority in the PSSI Extraordinary Congress or PSSI KLB was a joint victory.
""This is not my victory, this is the victory of Indonesian soccer people who are determined to advance the football that we love,"" he said at the Shangri-La Hotel, Jakarta, Saturday, November 2, 2019.
The former Metro Jaya Regional Police Chief admitted that he had met with the President of the World Football Federation (FIFA) Gianni Infantino. The meeting took place in Bangkok with an agenda to discuss the implementation of the U-20 World Cup in 2021. ""This is a big job for us all,"" he said.
Iwan Bule officially became the General Chair of PSSI 2019-2023. He defeated two other candidates, namely Rahim Soekasah and Arif Putra Wicaksono. The Lemhanas General Secretary won a majority of the votes, 82 of 86 votes.
Arif Putra Wicaksono acknowledged the victory of Iwan Bule. He said that of the 86 voters, there was one vote that abstained, namely Persis Solo. ""If the third one is just a technical error, the rest choose Mr. Iwan,"" he said.
Earlier, seven of the nine PSSI chairmen who formed an alliance, said they had withdrawn from the Extraordinary Congress or KLSI PSSI at the Shangri-La Hotel, Jakarta, Saturday, November 2, 2019. They walked out because they claimed to be asked to leave the PSSI Secretary General Ratu Tisha who is chairing the trial.
""We actually did not come out but were driven out by the Secretary General,"" said Kubu Sembilan Representative, Vijaya Fitriyasa.
According to him, the incident originated from the interruption of one part of Kubu Sembilan namely Fary Djemi Francis. Vijaya said they questioned election procedures that had not been previously socialized. He also asked for an explanation of the cancellation of the candidate's debate which was planned to be held on 31 October 2019.
""But the Secretary General said if there were candidates who did not agree to get out,"" he said.
The nine camps consisted of Fary Djemy Francis, Vijaya Fitriyasa, Yesayas Octavian, Rahim Soekasah, Arif Putra Wicaksono, Aven Hinelo, Benny Erwin, Bernhard Limbong and Sarman El Hakim. Kubu Sembilan members who remain in the KLB room are Arif Putra and Rahim Soekasah.
