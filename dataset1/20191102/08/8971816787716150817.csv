The fact has to do with the death of Dimar Torres at the hands of the military, on April 22 in Ocaña (North of Santander), and several conversions that rest in that group were revealed by the Prosecutor's Office and disseminated by Semana magazine.
""My colonel, I already killed him,"" Corporal Daniel Eduardo Gómez Robledo told his superior, Colonel Jorge Armando Pérez Amézquita.
As the noncommissioned officer also let him know that in the area there were several inhabitants and acquaintances of Torres who were asking about him, because according to preliminary information the community surprised the military when they were digging a grave apparently to bury the victim, the order of the Colonel was to watch them in case they should proceed.
""Check them, check them, because those are the ones that follow,"" said Officer Perez, according to the prosecutor in the case, a statement the magazine picked up.
Another of the instructions that, according to that medium, Perez gave to his junior, was that they communicate only by chat, and that it aired on the official radio to make a report in which they misrepresented the facts.
With these and other evidence against him, and after a senior Army officer acknowledged that Torres had died at the hands of the military and even apologized, Semana says the Prosecutor's Office called Colonel Pérez (ex-commander of the Land Operations Battalion No. 11, attached to the Vulcan Task Force) to charge charges for the crime of homicide in a protected person. Also, three soldiers who would be involved.
However, the magazine warns that in this case there have been “delays” on the part of the defense of Colonel Pérez, who asked to take his case to the Military Criminal Justice even though the death of the ex-combatant did not occur in the exercise of his tasks military
That is why the hearing was truncated and the officer was released along with the other three involved, and this Friday The FM reported that Colonel Pérez has no restrictions that prevent him from leaving the country.
""At this time, as the hearing was suspended, there is no element or measure that can be arranged in relation to it, because the hearing was suspended on behalf of the decision of the judge of guarantee control,"" said prosecutor Fabio Espitia , although according to the issuer the official confirmed that with the elements of judgment that the agency has, the Prosecutor's Office can “request an imputation and an assurance measure”.
