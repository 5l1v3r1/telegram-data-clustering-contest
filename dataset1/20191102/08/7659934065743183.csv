Until the disaster in Baghdad does not happen again
02 Nov 2019, 08:30 by Ghassan Sharbel
It was an uncertain day for Trump. There is little opportunity for the president to keep the world waiting for his story. The narrative was passionate. It was a moment of exceptional power in his presidency. It was able to deliver something that many enjoyed. And that is to say that he punished the criminal and the most wanted person in the world for his actions. He executed justice for a man who beheaded Americans and incited Yazidi devotion, slaughtered many Kurds in Syria and Iraq, and frightened Europeans and set a record for the diversity of his victims' citizenship. He spoke in the name of the mighty America. America's formidable capabilities and the most advanced military and intelligence organization utilizing the latest technology tools. He said of the dangers in the operation and the men who risked it. The man who mocked the terror in the heart of the world. She told how she was crying and frightened, and completed her crimes by killing three of her children. Reminds us that the long-awaited American arm reached Hamzah bin Laden some time ago, the son of a man who dragged America to the ground and targeted one of his symbols of power and success. Become Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. We are talking about a man who disturbed the region and the world. A rogue killer. An exceptional executioner who crossed borders and continents. For years, two nations and two nations have lost millions of lives. The legacy of his ancestors was thrown into the rivers of extremism. Donald Trump had the right to celebrate, in the techniques of killing and intimidation, and to dispel the waves of hatred. Such beats will be recorded in history. He may say in his heart that the death that was thrown at his direct command was more dangerous than that of his predecessor Barack Obama, Osama bin Laden. Fortunately for al-Qaeda leader it was not helpful to declare its ""government"" and nominate itself as a ""caliph"". He failed to attract those who flocked to him from faraway places after being deceived by phrases and flags. Trump has been in the midst of a storm since he entered the White House. Clearly, he loves the storms. His decisions are amazing and his method shocking. He is the only dancer who does not like Tango with institutions and countries. With the storm surging in the run-up to the election, this great gift arrived. It's not like announcing a withdrawal from a nuclear deal with Iran or imposing severe sanctions. It was different from the customs duties that were declared a trade war with China. Or we are referring to crushing the Turkish economy. Or the surprise announcement of withdrawing from Syria and moving away from ""endless nonsensical wars"" was something he had never achieved before. It was a gift that was welcomed by far and near countries. A valuable hunt that has led many to pre-empt their role in preparing this sur. Changed all the headlines. Sites that were busy preparing for the ouster of the president and criticizing his withdrawal from Syria found themselves in a single headline killing al-Baghdadi. Because he loves the excitement, Trump wrote a short tweet inviting the world to wait for the news after DNA testing. It cannot be said that Al-Baghdadi's body disarmed his opponents, but a gun was handed to him after rumors began that withdrawing from Syria was a separate gift from Russia and Iran to his ISIS. Trump could say his withdrawal from Syria, which has repeatedly been subject to revision and restraint in a limited number of areas, does not mean its withdrawal from the fight against terrorism. He will say that he will continue this war without the presence of soldiers stationed on stage to risk and avenge. Field commanders facing ISIL in Iraq and Syria confess that if the US Air Force had not been subjected to devastating blows to its hideouts and strongholds, the war would have lasted for years. And it should not be forgotten that the air strikes would not have been enough without the participation of the forces that waged widespread ground wars against the group. Let us put aside the issue. Al-Baghdadi's death does not mean killing ISIL, despite the importance of cutting the group. Experience has shown that such organizations have learned to adapt to difficult situations. ISIL has been decentralized in recent years. In the meantime, the group has come under pressure from the role of the ""single wolves"" in terrorizing and anxious around the world. Let's not kill our region and kill our countries with terrible destruction. We should remember that ISIL was born when countries were damaged and the cohesion of societies disappeared. In the shadow of the grudges of despair, he began to marginalize and try to take revenge and eliminate others and kill face lines. Remember, ISIS was born in Iraq. Shredded in Syria. Amidst the religious hatred. He had the opportunity when the rhetoric of rhetoric and rhetoric prevailed and when the gates of the Turkish border opened for the militants to enter Syria and fight for the blood of the revolution and its people. America is far away. Our lands are a stage. It's not just about security. The great devastation began when extremism in the ways and mosques prevailed, and when the students of the schools graduated with hatred, and they thought that any disagreement was worthy of the crime of murder. It has all parts of society. There is no other way than to open the door to the world and encourage coexistence and promote acceptance of the right to dispute. There is no solution but restoring hope to the future, restoring prosperity and protecting the youth from ISIL and any fanatic who votes to remove those who are not associated with the dark reading of the world. Trump is immersed in the light. He was so strong that he confessed to the help he had received from others. The General (Twitter) celebrated with a hunt for a man who had come out of the caves of history. But we would like to learn.
