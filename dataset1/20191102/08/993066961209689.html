      <p>Lena Dunham has revealed she uses a cane while she battles chronic illness.</p>
      <p>The Girls creator said she initially resisted using the support because she feared it would “make things weird”.</p>
      <p>The actress suffers from a type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which is a rare inherited condition that affects connective tissue, according to the NHS.</p>

      <p>Sharing a paparazzi photograph of herself dressed in a nightgown and holding the walking stick, on Instagram, she wrote: “I could choose to be embarrassed by these paparazzi pics- I mean, that’s probably the point of someone publishing them in the first place – but I’m really not.</p>
      <p>“I could lie and say it was an early Halloween look (Don’t you get it? I’m going as a con woman leaving a Florida Keys jail after being acquitted of murdering her husband, and now she’s trying to get disability license plates.)</p>
      <p>“But the truth is just: This is what life is like when I’m struggling most with chronic illness.</p>
      <p>“An Ehler-Danlos syndrome flare means that I need support from more than just my friends… so thank you, sweet cane!</p>
      <p>“For years, I resisted doing anything that would make my physical situation easier, insisting that a cane would ‘make things weird’.</p>
      <p>“But it’s so much less weird to actually be able to participate than to stay in bed all day.</p>
      <p>“And yes, you’d better believe I’m wearing my nightgown.</p>
      <p>“I was walking four feet to the car to go to the doctor and I wanted to be full cozy. I mean, didn’t Bieber wear hotel slippers for like five years?</p>
      <p>“Yeah, so I can wear my glamour nighty for two hours.”</p>
      <p>Dunham also shared a photo of herself in royal blue trousers and a matching crop top, adding: “And then an hour later, I’m in a meeting look tackling the job I love.</p>
      <p>“That’s the two-fold life of a woman with chronic illness; we still rock our dreams and goals and passions (and fashions) and we live many lives in one day. Tell me about your day!”</p>
