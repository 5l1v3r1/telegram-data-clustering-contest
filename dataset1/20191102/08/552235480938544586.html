      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T08:09:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 08:09</time> by <a rel="author">Ron Moore, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ron-moore/</a></address>
      <p>A dealer busted with almost £5,000 worth of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/drugs-1">Class-A drugs</a> has been jailed.</p>
      <p>Brian Dock, 39, was nabbed during a raid by cops at his flat in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paisley">Paisley’s George Street</a>.</p>
      <p>Dock was arrested following a tip-off that he had been dealing from the address and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">officers also found he had six mobile phones</a>; £500 in mixed bank notes; around £4,600-worth of cocaine and £240-worth of heroin.</p>
      <p>Dock, who has two previous convictions for possession of drugs, appeared at Paisley Sheriff Court and pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intention to supply in Paisley on March 20.</p>
      <p>He also admitted possession of heroin on the same date.</p>

      <p>Procurator Fiscal Depute Joanne Gilmour told the court: “Police officers attended the locus at around 7.15pm in possession of a search warrant.</p>
      <p>“They entered the property and the accused was located within. He was informed he was being detained for the purpose of a search.</p>
      <p>“A search was carried out and in a top shelf kitchen cupboard white powder, identified as cocaine weighing 115 grams, was found.</p>
      <p>“There was also brown powder recovered from a dog food box in the kitchen.</p>
      <p>“It was identified as diamorphine and weighed 5.4 grams.</p>
      <p>“There was also six mobile phones and £500 in mixed notes recovered from the living room.”</p>
      <p>The fiscal added that Dock was taken into custody where he was cautioned and charged, but made no reply to officers.</p>
      <p>Dock appeared for sentencing yesterday and his defence agent Kirsty McGeehan urged the court to consider his early plea of guilty when handing him his punishment.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She said: “The accused accepts full responsibility of for the offence.</p>
      <p>“He is single but in a relationship and only too well realises the impact this will have, not only on himself, but others.</p>
      <p>“He does have a record of drug misuse but fully appreciates the position he is in today given the serious nature of the charge.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff James Spy said custody was the only suitable sentence.</p>
      <p>He told him: “You pleaded guilty to a serious offence, trafficking in Class-A drugs, worth in excess of £4,500.</p>
      <p>“You don’t have a conviction for drug trafficking, but you do have a convictions for drugs offences.</p>
      <p>“Given the serious nature of the charge, it is custody for you today.”</p>
      <p>He handed Dock ten months in jail, reduced from 15 months because of his guilty plea.</p>
