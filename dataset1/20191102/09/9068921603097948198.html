      <p>Even without an Apple media event to round out October, we did get several product launches this week, including the AirPods Pro and the long-awaited Apple TV+ subscription service. <br/><br/>We're still waiting for the Mac Pro that's been promised in 2019 and updated iPad Pro and MacBook Pro models that may or may not come before the end of the year, so there's still lots to look forward to. Read on for all of the details on this week's debuts and what's still in Apple's pipeline.</p>

      <h3>Hands-On With the New Apple TV+ Streaming Service</h3>
      <p>Apple's new Apple TV+ streaming service <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/01/apple-tv-plus-launch/">has finally launched</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/01/hands-on-with-apple-tv-plus/">we went hands-on</a> to get an idea of what it's like. Apple TV+ is available across a host of platforms, and while the catalog is still awfully light, Apple is offering a number of ways to try out the service at little or no cost.</p>

      <h3>iOS 13.2 is Out With New Emoji, Deep Fusion for iPhone 11, Siri Privacy Options, and More</h3>
      <p>Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/28/apple-releases-ios-13-2/">released iOS 13.2 and iPadOS 13.2 for the iPhone and iPad</a>, respectively, with several new features like new emoji, Deep Fusion image processing for the iPhone 11 lineup, new Siri privacy options, AirPods Pro support, and more.</p>

      <p>iOS 13.2 led to a few leaks this week, including a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/28/apple-bluetooth-tracker-airtag-name/">potential "AirTags" name for Apple's rumored Tile-like item trackers</a> as well as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/28/apple-battery-case-images-ios-13-2/">Smart Battery Cases for the iPhone 11 lineup</a>. <br/><br/>Other software updates released this week include macOS Catalina 10.15.1, watchOS 6.1, tvOS 13.2, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/30/apple-releases-homepod-software-13-2-1/">revised 13.2.1 update for the HomePod</a> that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/28/new-13-2-update-bricking-some-homepods/">hopefully shouldn't brick the speaker anymore</a>.</p>
      <h3>Apple's Rumored Tile-Like Item Trackers May Be Named 'AirTags'</h3>
      <p>This week, based on an iOS 13.2 code discovery, we learned that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/28/apple-bluetooth-tracker-airtag-name/">Apple may be planning to call its rumored Tile-like item trackers "AirTags."</a></p>

      <p><i>A mockup of what AirTags could look like</i> <br/><i>MacRumors</i> then came across some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/28/airtag-trademark/">potential signs of Apple acquiring the rights to the "AirTag" trademark</a> from a Russian company, followed by a report claiming the mark was indeed sold to Apple. <br/><br/>AirTags will be closely integrated with the Find My app on iOS 13. MacRumors obtained <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/30/airtags-setup-find-my-screenshots/">additional screenshots of what the new "Items" tab</a> will look like in the app. It's unclear when Apple plans to introduce the tags. <br/><br/>For more details, read <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">everything we know about the AirTags so far</a>.</p>

Apple will also be selling the 32-inch Pro Display XDR with 6K resolution for $4,999, with an optional stand to be available for $999.</p>
      <h3>16-Inch MacBook Pro Touch Bar Layout Confirmed</h3>
      <p>An image uncovered in macOS Catalina 10.15.1 has revealed that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/30/16-inch-macbook-pro-touch-bar-layout/">Touch Bar and Touch ID will likely be separated on the 16-inch MacBook Pro</a>, lending credence to an earlier rumor that the Esc key will also be a separate, physical key again.</p>

      <p>It's unclear if the 16-inch MacBook Pro will be released in 2019 or 2020, but a supply chain report has claimed that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/31/16-inch-macbook-pro-volume-shipments-4q19/">Apple will begin to receive volume shipments of the notebook</a> in the fourth quarter of this year, possibly to sidestep a proposed 15% tariff on additional Chinese imports that is slated to go into effect December 15.</p>
