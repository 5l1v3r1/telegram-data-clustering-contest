02 Nov 2019, 09:30

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】華航今天(2日)下午飛往帛琉的CI-28班機在起飛前，發現一名外籍男子竟出現在飛機起落架，遭航警逮捕。警方目前正在了解，這名男子是如何闖入管制區跑道及企圖。
據了解，這名外籍男子會被發現，是排在華航後方的韓亞航班機機長通報塔台，告知華航班機起落架上有人，不要起飛，塔台緊急通知航警現場逮人。
華航表示，這架飛帛琉的班機搭載149名旅客，原訂於下午1時35分起飛，因為這起事件，於跑道頭等待起飛時，接獲通報有人出現機下輪艙附近，立即返回機坪進行特別檢查，考量航機安全以及旅客等候時間，已另調派航機於台北時間4點20分出發。
桃園國際機場公司表示，目前不知這名男子是從何處進入屬於管制區的跑道，正詳細了解中。

警方初步瞭解，這名闖入的外籍男子來自白俄羅斯，的行李內有反光背心，瓦斯爐點火器數支，還有一張看不懂的手繪圖。男子被捕後一語不發，目前查過指紋和虹膜沒有任何記録，不排除也是偷渡入境。
