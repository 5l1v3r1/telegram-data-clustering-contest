Earlier this week Mr Corbyn said he would “not seek to block” another Scottish independence vote, although Labour emphasised it would not be an “early priority”. Mr Gove told the Mail: ” It clearly wasn't a gaffe – that was clearly the fluttering of their eyelashes at the SNP and now they are in bed together. And Corbyn and his team have made it perfectly clear they will offer the SNP a referendum.”
