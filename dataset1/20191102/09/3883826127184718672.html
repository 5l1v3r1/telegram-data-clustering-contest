      <p>The 26-year-old collided with team-mate Maro Itoje, trying to tackle Makazole Mapimpi, and immediately hit the floor.</p>
      <p>There was a lengthy stoppage as Sinckler was assessed by the on-duty doctor, before he regained consciousness and walked off the field.</p>
      <p>The Harlequins front-row was replaced by 32-year-old Dan Cole.</p>

      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Former England international and BBC Radio 5 Live pundit Paul Grayson</i>
      </p>
      <p>Sinckler's a runner, key to those pivot plays England use. Dan Cole is a good tight-head but not as nimble.</p>
      <p>You think in an hour, with the pressure he'll be under, he's going to be drained.</p>
