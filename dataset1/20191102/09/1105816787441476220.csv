Bella Thorne slammed for 'glamourising' physcial abuse
02 Nov 2019, 09:44 by Entertainment Desk
Bella Thorne might not have meant any harm with her latest Halloween outfit, however, followers of the actor are calling her out for taking her look for the night too far.
Thorne posted three selfies on Instagram on Wednesday, thanks to Halloween that seem to essay the actor with a busted lip and bruised eye. She captioned the post, “Hire me for your Halloween makeup. I got you, boo.”



While some followers appreciated her darkish humorousness, many believed the star was making mild of home abuse.
“Why is glamorising being physically abused culturally appropriate during Halloween?” one individual requested, with one other including, “I’m not the only one who thinks it’s insensitive.”



One follower even shared the psychological results of seeing such a picture for individuals who have survived bodily abuse.
“I just find this post slightly triggering and surprising as she is a strong spokeswoman against abuse and such.”
For Halloween itself, Thorne went with a far much less controversial look, rocking a revealing Girl Scouts uniform.
Thorne has but to answer the backlash to her made-up look.
