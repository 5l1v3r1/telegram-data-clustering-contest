      <p><b>DETROITÂ (AP)</b> - Union workers at Ford will start voting Monday on a proposed four-year contract that includes wage increases and more than $6 billion for investments at 19 plants.</p>
      <p>The United Auto Workers said Friday that its National UAW-Ford council voted to send the deal to 55,000 workers for a ratification vote.</p>
      <p>The Ford workers would get 4% lump-sum payments in the first and third years of the contract, and 3% wage increases in the second and fourth years, according to a summary posted by the union. Workers would see no reduction in health care benefits and won't pay more for their coverage. New hires will reach the top pay scale sooner.</p>
      <p>They would get ratification bonuses of $9,000 - less than the $11,000 bonuses that workers at General Motors won last month, but they didn't endure a lengthy strike like their counterparts at GM.</p>
      <p>The union said the Ford agreement includes the promise of investments that will create or save more than 8,500 jobs.</p>
      <p>The Romeo engine plant in Michigan will close. The union said workers will be transferred to a nearby transmission shop or offered early-retirement buyouts. The UAW said it got a moratorium on other plant closures for the life of the contract.</p>
      <p>Union officials will begin presenting the terms to members around the country this weekend. Voting is scheduled to start Monday and run until Nov. 15.</p>
      <p>The deal was reached relatively quickly and without the conflict that led to a 40-day strike by UAW members against GM.</p>
      <p>Art Wheaton, director of a labor institute at Cornell University, said the long walkout at GM helped Ford and the UAW settle faster.</p>
      <p>"They use the pattern from GM, and the UAW Ford membership knows they got a reasonable deal," he said. "The $6 billion in investments is a good deal for both parties."</p>
      <p>Many of the investments will focus on building trucks like the F-150. Some of the spending and products, according to the union:</p>
      <p>- $1.1 billion for an assembly plant in Wayne, Michigan; new Ford Ranger and Bronco.</p>
      <p>- $1 billion at the truck plant in Louisville, Kentucky; new Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator.</p>
      <p>- $900 million at an assembly plant in Avon Lake, Ohio; a medium truck and other work.</p>
      <p>- $700 million for the Dearborn, Michigan, truck plant; new F-150 models.</p>
      <p>- $400 million at the Kansas City assembly plant; new F-150.</p>
      <p>If Ford workers ratify the contract, the union will begin bargaining with Fiat Chrysler, which announced Thursday that it plans to merge with France's PSA Group to create the world's fourth-largest auto company, worth $50 billion.</p>
