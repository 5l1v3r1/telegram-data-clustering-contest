我們想讓你知道的是Tolt拍攝了一系列「不要去」旅遊影片，其中最具盛名的「不要去伊朗」中用影像破除一般人對伊朗的刻板印象，3年後的今天，他則將鏡頭轉向台灣。



（中央社）法國導演兼攝影師Tolt於3年前推出「不要去伊朗」影片，試圖以影像破除刻板印象，廣獲好評。他的同系列最新作品以台灣為題，最後結論「不要去台灣——亞洲之心會讓你著迷」。
Tolt於今年10月27日在影音網站YouTube上傳「不要去台灣」影片，5天累積12萬人次觀賞，這支長3分41秒的影片紀錄了台灣的山林、寺廟、飲食、多元文化及台灣民眾日常生活。



這支影片開頭雖寫出「台灣只有高樓與工廠」，但畫面卻帶出台灣森林、雲海、野生動物等畫面；提及「台灣寺廟枯燥乏味」時，畫面顯示出廟宇內精緻的雕刻、信眾牆等細節；在「台灣沒有美食」時，畫面卻是小籠包、海鮮、排骨酥等令人垂涎欲滴的佳餚。
影片藉豐富、優美的畫面與運鏡，打破一連串象徵刻板印象的字眼，帶出許多台灣在地觀光特色，短短幾天已瘋迷台灣網友。
Tolt本名馬蒂尼（Benjamin Martinie），專門拍攝旅遊相關影像，特別喜愛造訪相對較不熱門的國家地區。
Tolt拍攝了一系列「不要去」旅遊影片，包括「不要去伊朗」、「不要去阿爾及利亞」、「不要去喬治亞」、「不要去亞美尼亞」等。



法國重點週刊（Le Point）2016年訪問Tolt時，他那年25歲，與朋友同遊伊朗。他回憶伊朗人的熱情、好客與從容，在兩週的旅程中，他與朋友幾乎都免費住在當地人家裡；旅途中，他也親眼看見「道德警察」在路邊要求年輕女性包好頭巾。
旅程結束後，Tolt製作影片，試圖用影像解構一般人對伊朗的刻板印象，最後以「不要去伊朗……你可能會遇見一生中最棒的旅行」作為結尾。
「不要去伊朗」影片在社群網站突破百萬人次觀賞後，Tolt延續相同主題，推出「不要去阿爾及利亞」，這支3分鐘左右的影片呈現阿爾及利亞的壯麗景色、建築、美食及年輕人的活力，結論是「不要去阿爾及利亞……你可能會想要留在那裡」。
法國新聞電台（Franceinfo）一篇於2017年上線的報導提到，Tolt透過影片破除許多人對一個地方的刻板印象，例如阿爾及利亞不只有沙漠。他曾在自己的部落格中提到，當他告訴親友自己要去阿爾及利亞時，有些人的反應是阿爾及利亞很危險，雖然不是全無道理，但當地多數地區並無風險，只是不建議在無人帶領的情況下獨自前往一些敏感地點。
