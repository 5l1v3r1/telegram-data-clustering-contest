Latest news
Jorge Masvidal is ready to fight Conor McGregor next year.
The Irishman has not fought since he was choked out by Khabib Nurmagomedov last October in their lightweight world title fight.
But McGregor is due to return on January 18 against Donald Cerrone and will then target the winner of Masvidal's fight against Nate Diaz tonight.
And Masvidal is ready to grant him his wish.
""Conor’s done amazing things in this sport, and I always give – not always – but I try to give credit where credit is due,"" he said.
""He’s got two belts, he’s got the fastest knockout with the title, he’s done a lot of great things, you know. But as of late, he hasn’t competed in a while.
""I’m just hearing things; I’m not seeing. If he comes back and fights, fights whoever he fights and wins, and wants to fight me, of course I’m going to fight that guy over everybody just like I’m going to fight Nate, because Nate’s a huge dog.
""Conor’s the same, he’s a fighter. He might not be the toughest guy, but he’s a hell of a fighter, and he brings in millions of dollars, so of course I’m going to fight that guy over all these other bums. It’s a no-brainer, man. But is he fighting? I don’t know.""
