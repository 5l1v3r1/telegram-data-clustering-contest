[Wonderful recommendation] Xi Jinping went to the United States to sign an agreement? /The CCP’s three major actions against Hong Kong

02 Nov 2019, 09:33

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] NTDTV recommends daily wonderful articles and video programs for readers:
Hong Kong police atrocities provoked public outrage Since Hong Kong launched a ""self-defense class"" since the massive protests in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong police have increasingly used tear gas, water guns, and live ammunition to clear the field. There is no bottom line to suppress the bloody of the demonstrators. In order to counter the indiscriminate use of police officers, the Hong Kong University Students will hold relevant ""training classes"" on campus to teach self-defense techniques and escape skills to protect themselves.
The four Chinese communiques released the signal: The CCP’s communiqué on the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party’s three major possible actions just closed, and the Hong Kong counter-delivery movement, which is concerned about public opinion, responded strongly and hoped to draw some red lines for Hong Kong by legal means. Some scholars and experts and public opinion analysis believe that the CCP may have three major moves in Hong Kong.
The CCP’s think tank exposed the biggest crisis next year: the “lack of water” in China’s economy, the fleeing of foreign capital, the decline in foreign exchange reserves, and the depreciation of the renminbi have all seriously affected China’s finance. Some mainland scholars have said that next year will be the peak period for the CCP’s debt repayment, the biggest crisis. In the case of funds “lack of water”, once there is a problem in the market capital supply chain, it is likely to induce a financial crisis.
[Live playback] ""112 for help international, stick to self-government"" rally (Chinese translation) This weekend, Hong Kong people continue to launch anti-total anti-corruption activities. On Thursday, ""The 831 attacks will be held for two months."" On Saturday, there will be ""112 for international assistance, adherence to self-government"" gatherings. NTDTV and The Epoch Times will conduct a full tracking and live webcast. Please lock in the live news room.
Xi Jinping went to the United States to sign an agreement? Trump revealed that the new US-China trade war has continued for 16 months, and optimistic information about this negotiation has warmed up. A few days ago, US President Trump (Trump) said that he plans to hold talks with Xi Jinping in Iowa and sign a trade agreement to end the trade war that lasted for more than a year.
China's pork prices skyrocketed A pot of meat sold for 400 yuan netizens stunned China's mainland due to the impact of African swine fever and trade wars, pork prices continue to soar. Recently, a photo of a menu in the mainland online community showed that the price of pork in a restaurant recipe (10 pieces) was as high as 400 yuan (RMB, the same below), causing a group of netizens to stun the chin. The store responded that the cost is high and the weight is sufficient, and the price can only be fixed.
The Fourth Plenary Session kicked off the Cultural Revolution? Scholars: The Xinjiang Model or the popularization of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party continues to emphasize the ""center of learning"" and strengthen ""the party leads everything."" Beijing scholars believe that this is equivalent to fully clarifying the clarion call back to the Cultural Revolution. The CCP may rule the country with the ""Xinjiang Model"" in the future.
The plenary session repeated 55 times. The keyword ""persistence"" maps Xi Jinping's biggest predicament. The communique of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee has no major personnel changes and signs of impaired power within Xi Jinping. However, there have been 55 ""persistences"" such as ""adhering to the socialist system"", ""holding on the party to lead everything"" and ""maintaining the main body of public ownership."" Public opinion believes that the more emphasis on ""persistence"", the more unstable it is.
A large amount of capital fled China's foreign reserves bottomed out Foreign debt reached 3.5 trillion US dollars affected by the US-China trade war, China's economic growth rate fell to the lowest in 27 years, coupled with a large amount of capital flight, foreign exchange reserves continued to decline. Some research institutes say that the CCP’s foreign exchange reserves are almost negative, and the external debt is at least 3 trillion to 3.5 trillion US dollars, more than 1 trillion US dollars higher than the official data.
Navarro: Three-stage solution to the CCP's ""seven sins"" US-China trade negotiations are moving toward the first phase of the agreement, and White House trade consultant Peter Navarro said recently that even if the first phase of the agreement goes smoothly, two more At this stage, the structural ""seven sins"" of the CCP can be completely resolved.
""Down with Xi Jinping"" shouted and cried in despair. Xi Jinping, who is now in power, has had a period of despair. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Xi Gang was labeled as a counter-revolutionary when he was 13 years old. At the commemorative meeting held by the Communist Party School of the Communist Party of China, ""Dr. Xi Jinping"" was crying. My mother was forced to shout slogans and beat her son... A rainy night, the sneaked back home, the mother was frightened, reported the report, and cried desperately. And desperately ran into the rainy night.
Zhongnanhai revolves around Hong Kong's squadrons in the turmoil of the Hong Kong government. After the British media released the wind, Zheng Yuexi will be removed from Beijing, Lin Zheng suddenly set up an independent investigation committee in Songkou, and then there will be a signal from the Hong Kong police force. However, the Hong Kong High Court has issued an interim injunction to prohibit the Hong Kong police from being bottomed out, etc., and the various contradictory practices of the Hong Kong Government are frequent.
Secret: Hu Jintao's six-character game Jiang Zemin recruited Hu Jintao as the CCP's general secretary for 10 years, and power was ridden by Jiang Zemin, which led to the imperial decree. After Xi Jinping took office, he took power and took the many confidants of Jiang Zemin in the name of anti-corruption. Jiang is incomparable, and all this is related to Hu Jintao’s ""catching"" Jiang Zemin twice.
""The CCP does not represent the Chinese."" Speech by Pompey's Think Tank On October 30th, US Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo gave a speech at the Hudson Institute in New York, a conservative think tank. He said that the United States has always expected China under the CCP to become a democratic country, thus condoning the CCP in many aspects, but now it is finally realized that the CCP has always been hostile to American values.
Former US Speaker: The CCP is the biggest threat. Pompeo: Must respond positively on Tuesday (October 29). Former US House Speaker Gingrich called on the United States to recognize that the CCP is a totalitarian system and the greatest threat to the United States. The next day, US Secretary of State Pompeo said that the United States has already recognized the CCP’s hostility towards the United States and the fundamental opposition between the US and China’s ideology and will face the CCP positively.
FBI Director: Counter-intelligence pays special attention to or is disturbed by the Chinese Communist Party's general election. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director Christopher Wray said in a testimony on Congress on Wednesday (October 30) that the FBI is particularly concerned about counter-intelligence (anti-spyware). The CCP also reminded the United States to be alert to the CCP’s dissemination of false news and to interfere with the presidential election next year.
US network security company report: CCP steals overseas mobile phone information politicians also slashed a US well-known network security company released a report on Thursday, disclosed the Chinese hacker organization involved in the CCP government, using a new malware to steal overseas mobile phone users to send The short message and the call record. It is said that not only dissidents and journalists are easily targeted by these hackers, but even some mobile communications of military and political officials in some countries have been stolen by hackers, and victims are often unaware of them.
Huang Zhifeng: The CCP can ban me from running for election but can't silence everyone. ""Beijing can ban my candidacy, but I refuse to remain silent."" Recently, the Hong Kong public opinion secretary Huang Zhifeng wrote that democracy begins with the public and he hopes Hong Kong people will vote. Let the outside world hear their voice of seeking democracy. The CCP cannot let everyone be silent.
Zhongnanhai revolves around Hong Kong's squadrons in the turmoil of the Hong Kong government. After the British media released the wind, Zheng Yuexi will be removed from Beijing, Lin Zheng suddenly set up an independent investigation committee in Songkou, and then there will be a signal from the Hong Kong police force. However, the Hong Kong High Court has issued an interim injunction to prohibit the Hong Kong police from being bottomed out, etc., and the various contradictory practices of the Hong Kong Government are frequent.
Meng Xiazhou's lawyers met with a setback. The police arrested the police and tried to extradite the eldest daughter of Ren Zhenghua, chairman of the board of directors of Hua Wei, and the financial director of Huawei Group, Meng Xizhou, and is currently in the court hearing stage. Meng’s team of lawyers was extradited to the United States for the suspension of Meng, and the attack on the Canadian police during the initial seizure of Meng’s boat was suspected of illegal. However, court documents on Thursday showed that the Canadian Mounted Police submitted multiple affidavits and categorically denied the relevant allegations of the defense.
Human Rights Organization: The police were indulged in the increasingly serious riots. The anti-send campaign in Hong Kong continued. On the Halloween of October 31, someone initiated a masked party at Lan Kwai Fong in Central. During the period, some Hong Kong residents and journalists were sprayed with pepper by police officers. The agent sprayed directly on the face. In addition, in the demonstrations in Mong Kok, social workers were beaten by the police with batons. Human rights groups say the police have been condoned by excessive use of force. Ye Kwok-ro, a spokesman for the Human Rights Monitor, pointed out that these means of the Hong Kong Government do not help solve the problem and must respond to the core demands of the people.
Hong Kong has promoted the ""Water Bill"" for police country members to impose sanctions on the deterioration of the situation in Hong Kong. The accused has become a ""police country"". Three US senators recently proposed the ""Hong Kong Be Water Act"", which requires ""plus"" To deal with the Chinese and Hong Kong officials who have oppressed Hong Kong people's basic rights such as speech, assembly, and procession, as well as those who cooperate with them.
Governing Hong Kong is more stringent? After the Fourth Central Committee, the CCP proposed the ""fourth plenary session of the Chinese Communist Party"", which was just completed, and the first time it proposed ""administration of governance"" in Hong Kong and Macao. Later, the CCP officials further explained that they should ""improve the appointment and dismissal system of the Chief Executive of the SAR."" The outside world is worried that the CCP may have to run counter to the ""double suffrage"" demanded by the Hong Kong people.
