港警暴行激民憤 香港開辦「自衞班」

02 Nov 2019, 09:38

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】自香港爆發大規模抗議行動以來，港警越來越瘋狂的使用催淚彈、水炮車，以及真槍實彈等清場，無底線對示威者血腥鎮壓。為了對抗警員濫捕濫暴，香港中大學生會在校內舉辦相關「練武班」，教導自衛術及逃脫技巧以保護自己。
據《路透》報導，一名31歲的課程參與者Pino說，她以前是跳舞的，參加各類舞蹈課程，包括爵士、嘻哈音樂，以及鋼管舞。Pino表示：現在「我已停止跳舞，我現在習武。」她解釋：「現時我們需要作戰，而不是跳舞。」
Pino在資訊科技界任職，在前線擔當「義務護士」的角色，為在場傷者包紮，並非所謂的「勇武派」，但她也參加練武班。她說，教練會教授如何逃避警方拘捕等。課程也會播放真實衝突時的畫面。
有示威者透露：在過去數月出現多個同類課程，這是其中一個。
近期的集會，幾乎場場出現警察血腥鎮壓的場面。William Cheung是一名在中大舉辦這些恆常自衞課程的人士。他說：不僅站在前線的人士或年輕人，我們也要學習這些技巧保護自己。」
William Cheung說，如果不保護好自己，不知道何時會被打死，或被打至受傷或需送院。
在10月份的一個早上，中大圖書館外約有10多名學生練習劍擊，他們使用泡綿軟棍模擬警方的警棍，並嘗試以背包作為盾牌抵擋攻擊。
一名男參加者說：「今日課堂的主題為逃走」，他認為示威衝突並沒有結束的跡象，因此這樣的課程是有必要的。

近日，兩名訪美的「香港民間記者會」成員說，港人反送中抗爭一直採取多種多樣的形式，抗争行动中的「勇武派」是因為應對警察的暴力而產生。比如香港警察中有一支極度暴力的「速龍小隊」，他們手中沾有反送中示威者的鮮血，這樣便催生了「勇武派」中的「屠龍小隊」。
他們說，「屠龍小隊」在香港抗爭的勇武行為，主要是想為他們死去的手足出一口氣。但他們是聰明的，知道該作什麼，不該做什麼。
他們還預測未來「勇武派」與警察的對峙將越來越嚴重，過去的警民關係再也回不去了。香港人已經徹底的仇視香港警察，我們已經放棄他們了，解散他們吧。
他們認為，香港的反送中運動跟民主運動不會一朝一夕就完成：我們是時候想一想，把每天的抗爭化為數以年計、十年計的運動，將運動延續下去，把對政府的抗爭變成香港生活的一部分。
香港主權移交北京之前，曾被譽為「亞洲最精良部隊」（Asia’s finest）的香港警隊，因為在持續近5個月的香港反送中運動中濫捕、濫暴、濫權，卻不受監管備受國際輿論詬病。
港警在市民的重重敦促下，不但沒有收斂跡象，反倒無底線的升級鎮壓力度。在中共「十一」開槍，及10月5日《禁蒙面法》推出後，港人的五大訴求已增加一條，即「解散警隊、刻不容緩」。
第17次「民間記者會」上發言人譴責警方實彈開槍殺人，並表達「自由之心不死 奈何以槍斃之」的抗爭決心。反送中抗爭以來「被自殺」與性暴力頻傳，香港年輕人仍前仆後繼的走上前線捍衛普世價值，精神堪比1989年六四學運。
曾參與六四學運的王華撰文感慨，這批走在香港抗爭最前線的年輕人，就像是當年被中共害死的同伴們，如今他們從北京轉生到了香港，目的就是要完成未竟的使命。

Hong Kong police violently angered Hong Kong to launch ""self-defense class""

02 Nov 2019, 09:38

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] Since the outbreak of large-scale protests in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong police have increasingly used tear gas, water guns, and live ammunition to clear the field. There is no bottom line to suppress the bloody of the demonstrators. In order to counter the indiscriminate use of police officers, the Hong Kong University Students will hold relevant ""training classes"" on campus to teach self-defense techniques and escape skills to protect themselves.
According to Reuters, a 31-year-old course participant, Pino, said she used to dance and participate in a variety of dance classes, including jazz, hip hop, and pole dancing. Pino said: ""I have stopped dancing now, I am practicing martial arts now."" She explained: ""We need to fight now, not dance.""
Pino is in the information technology industry and plays the role of ""obligatory nurse"" on the front line. It is not the so-called ""Yongwu School"" for the wounded, but she also participates in the training class. She said that the coach will teach how to avoid police arrests. The course also plays a picture of the actual conflict.
Some demonstrators revealed that there have been many similar courses in the past few months, and this is one of them.
In the recent rally, there was almost a scene of police bloody suppression. William Cheung is a person who holds these constant self-defense courses at CUHK. He said: Not only people who are on the front line, but also young people, we must learn these skills to protect ourselves. ""
William Cheung said that if you don't protect yourself, you don't know when you will be killed, or you will be injured or need to be sent to hospital.
On the morning of October, about 10 students outside the Zhongda Library practiced sword fights. They used foam sticks to simulate police batons and tried to use the backpack as a shield to resist the attack.
A male participant said: ""The theme of today's class is escape."" He believes that the demonstration conflict does not end, so such a course is necessary.

Recently, two members of the ""Hong Kong Folk Press Conference"" who visited the United States said that the resistance of the Hong Kong people in the anti-delivery has been taking various forms. The ""Yongwu School"" in the fight against action was caused by the violence against the police. For example, the Hong Kong police have an extremely violent ""Athlon Dragon Squad"" with blood in the hands of the demonstrators. This has given birth to the ""Dragon Squad"" in the ""Yongwu School"".
They said that the brave behavior of the ""Taolong Squad"" in Hong Kong was mainly to give a sigh of relief to their dead hands. But they are smart, know what to do and what not to do.
They also predicted that the confrontation between the ""Yongwu School"" and the police will become more and more serious in the future, and the police-civilian relationship in the past will no longer be able to return. Hong Kong people have completely hated Hong Kong police. We have given up on them and disbanded them.
They believe that the anti-delivery movement and the democratic movement in Hong Kong will not be completed overnight: we just have to think about it and turn the daily struggle into a number of years and ten years of movement, and continue the movement to the government. Resistance has become part of Hong Kong's life.
Before Hong Kong’s sovereignty was handed over to Beijing, the Hong Kong Police Force, once known as Asia’s finest, was indiscriminately arrested, abused and abused in the Hong Kong anti-delivery campaign that lasted for nearly five months. Supervision has been criticized by international public opinion.
Under the urging of the public, the Hong Kong Police not only did not show signs of convergence, but also had no bottom line to upgrade the town's pressure. After the ""11"" shooting of the CCP and the launch of the ""Forbidden Mask Method"" on October 5, the five major demands of the Hong Kong people have been increased, that is, ""the dissolution of the police force cannot be delayed.""
A spokesman for the 17th ""Folk Reporting Press"" condemned the police for shooting and killing live ammunition and expressed the determination to fight ""the heart of freedom is not dead."" Since the fight against the ""suicide"" and sexual violence have been repeated, Hong Kong young people are still on the front line to defend the universal value, the spirit is comparable to the 1989 June Fourth Movement.
Wang Hua, who had participated in the June 4th student movement, wrote that these young people who are at the forefront of Hong Kong’s struggle are like the companions who were killed by the CCP in the past. Now they have been transferred from Beijing to Hong Kong, the purpose is to complete the unfinished mission.
