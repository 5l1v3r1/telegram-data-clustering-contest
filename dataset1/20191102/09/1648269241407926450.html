      <h1>Chevy Equinox Discounted Up To 20 Percent In November</h1>
      <h2>As part of Chevrolet's Black Friday promotion.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T09:35:51+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 09:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/jacob-oliva/" target="_blank">Jacob Oliva</a></address>
      <p>It seems like <a href="https://www.motor1.com/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> wants to keep its SUVs and crossovers in the center of the spotlight in the U.S. The <a href="https://www.motor1.com/chevrolet/equinox/">Equinox</a> compact crossover gets another set of discounts this November, fuelling the ever-increasing popularity of these high-riding cars.</p>
      <p>According to a report by the <i><a href="http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/11/chevrolet-discount-drops-equinox-price-by-up-to-20-percent-in-november-2019/">GM Authority</a></i>, Chevy is dropping the Equinox's price by up to 20 percent as part of the brand's Black Friday sales event. With this, it's expected the crossover's sales numbers will continue to rise, following the reported 2 percent sales increase during Q3 of 2019.</p>
      <p>The maximum 20 percent discount applies to MY 2019 Equinox units. For a 2019 Equinox AWD Premier with an MSRP of $40,250, the discount equates to a $1,833 price reduction plus a $6,217 cash allowance for a total of $8,050. This brings down the price of top-tier Equinox to $32,200.</p>
      <p>Newer MY 2020 Equinox units, on the other hand, are also part of the November offer. With a 15 percent discount employed, a 2020 Equinox AWD Premier, with an MSRP of $41,165, will get a new price tag of $34,991 after the mentioned cashback.</p>
