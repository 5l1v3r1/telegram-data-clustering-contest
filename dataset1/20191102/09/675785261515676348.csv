Darren Till arrived late in New York but made weight for his middleweight debut against Kelvin Gastelum.
The Brit dismissed reports of visa issues as he landed in the Big Apple on Thursday, just 48 hours before he touches gloves with his rival.
But Till made weight on Friday and will now bid to prove he can be a contender at the higher weight having lost his welterweight world title shot to Tyron Woodley last year.
He also lost to Jorge Masvidal who takes on Nate Diaz in the main event at UFC 244 tonight with the winner being presented with the BMF belt by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.

He steps up a division tonight against Kelvin Gastelum and Hardy is excited about the prospect.
""I have no concerns with Darren moving up to middleweight,"" he said.
""I had more concerns with him staying at welterweight, to be honest. For his last two fights I’ve been around him during fight week, particularly in Liverpool for Wonderboy, he was drawn, he was tired and hungry and thirsty.
""I don’t want to see a fighter like that before the biggest fight of their life. This Darren Till is fresh, happy, lively and comfortable. He’s moving so well.
""When a fighter feels good they look and move good.""
