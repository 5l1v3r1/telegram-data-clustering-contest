Kyle Sincker 'out before he hit the ground' after being brutally KO'd just minutes into World Cup final
02 Nov 2019, 09:40 by Ian Cameron
England got off to a shaky start in the World Cup final they lost 32-12, an opening which was compounded by the loss of tighthead Kyle Sinckler after he was brutally knocked out.
Sinckler was KO’d out after colliding with Maro Itoje. The accidental collision came when the pair of England forwards tackled Springbok winger Makazole Mapimpi in the third minute.



Sinckler receiving treatment


Sinckler was left motionless on the ground with his arms straight in the air. The reaction, known as the ‘fencing response’, is often an indicator of a mid-level but not severe concussion.
Sinckler was attended to by medics and came round after two of three minutes of attention.
It was a collision that worried many on social media:
























Sinckler was sent for a HIA and was automatically removed from the game. The concern for England fans then became whether Dan Cole could last 77 minutes of rugby. Cole started against USA but came off the bench in all of England’s other matches – against Tonga, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand.
Sinckler has been one of the standout front rows at the World Cup. The 120kg tighthead credits his mother with introducing him to rugby, after he switched from football at age eight after his mother heard of his physicality on the pitch.
Sinckler was described as an ‘emotional timebomb’ by Wales coach Warren Gatland during the 2019 Six Nations. Subsequently, Sinckler conceded three penalties during England’s 21-13 defeat by Wales and was replaced in the 57th minute.
The Harlequins prop conceded the second-most penalties of any player during the 2018-19 Premiership season with 29 behind Northampton’s Alex Waller. Harlequins captain Chris Robshaw spoke to him about discipline after he received a yellow card for slapping Sale’s Faf de Klerk in the chest.
Growing up he modelled himself on former New Zealand prop Carl Hayman.
