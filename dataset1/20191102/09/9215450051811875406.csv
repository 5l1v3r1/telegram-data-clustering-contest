中文大學香港亞太研究所日前公佈了10月份「特區政府及特首民望意見調查結果」，行政長官林鄭月娥整體表現評分自今年3月開始持續下跌，最新結果為25.5分，較9月份時下跌2.7分，較去年10月的52.3分，跌幅超過一半。撰文：Smart ED編輯部｜ 圖片：林鄭月娥Facebook專頁、新傳媒資料室 民調在10月22至28日進行，即施政報告發表後一星期，訪問了共714名市民，除了特首林鄭月娥的評分下跌外，其他各項民望指標都較去年同月份為低，包括對特區政府的滿意度﹐有一成受訪者表示滿意，較九月時跌1.3個百分點，有六成六市民表示不滿意，較九月時升2.7個百分點。

對3位司長的評分方面，政務司司長張建宗的評分為30.9分，較9月時下跌1.2分；財政司司長陳茂波的評分為26.9分，較9月時下跌1.8分；律政司司長鄭若驊的評分為18.0分，較9月時下跌1.4分。至於對香港特區政府的信任度，16.0%的受訪者表示信任；55.7%表示不信任；26.8%回答「普通／一半半」。對北京中央政府的信任度方面，14.0%受訪者表示信任；58.4%表示不信任；23.0%回答「普通／一半半」。
林鄭在2017年3月的行政長官選舉論壇曾表示：「如果香港人主流意見令到我再無辦法擔任行政長官，我係會辭職」。近月來因「反修例」風波，導致林鄭民望插水，加上早前傳出中央有意更撤換特首，令林鄭下台的消息甚囂塵上。不過，林鄭日前出席一個商界活動致辭時，表示：「We will not rest. I will not rest」，明言「不會休息」﹐又強調會繼續落實「一國兩制」，維護法治，並找出方法，讓已分裂的社會重拾信任。

The Hong Kong Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies of the Chinese University recently announced the results of the survey on the opinion of the SAR Government and the Chief Executive. The overall performance score of the Chief Executive, Mrs Carrie Lam, has continued to fall since March this year. The latest result is 25.5 points, which is 2.7 points lower than that in September. Points, more than half of the decline of 52.3 points in October last year. Written by: Smart ED Editorial Department | Photo: Lin Zhengyue's Facebook page, New Media Reference Room polls were held from October 22 to 28, one week after the policy address was published, and a total of 714 citizens were interviewed, except for the special chief Lin Zhengyue. In addition to the decline in ratings, all other public opinion indicators were lower than the same month last year, including satisfaction with the SAR Government.

Regarding the ratings of the three Directors, the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, scored 30.9 points, down 1.2 points from September. The Financial Secretary, Chen Maobo, scored 26.9 points, down 1.8 points from September. The Department of Justice Director Zheng Ruoxuan scored 18.0 points, down 1.4 points from September. As for the trust of the Hong Kong SAR Government, 16.0% of the respondents expressed trust; 55.7% expressed distrust; 26.8% answered ""ordinary / half and half"". Regarding the trust of the Beijing Central Government, 14.0% of the respondents expressed trust; 58.4% expressed distrust; 23.0% answered “ordinary/half-half”.
At the Chief Executive Election Forum in March 2017, Mr Lam said: ""If the mainstream opinion of Hong Kong people makes me unable to serve as the Chief Executive, my department will resign."" In recent months, due to the ""anti-revision"" turmoil, Lin Zhengmin hopes to insert water, and the news that the Central Committee intends to remove the Chief Executive earlier has made Lin Zheng’s decision to step down. However, when attending a speech at a business event, Lin Zheng said: ""We will not rest. I will not rest"", saying that ""no rest"" and stressing that it will continue to implement ""one country, two systems"", uphold the rule of law and find ways. Let the divided society regain trust.
