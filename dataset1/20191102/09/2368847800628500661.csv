中共智囊曝明年最大危機 ：資金「缺水」

02 Nov 2019, 09:06

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】中國經濟下行、外資出逃、外匯儲備下降、人民幣貶值等都對中國金融造成嚴重影響，有大陸學者日前表示，明年是中共還債高峰期，最大的危機在於資金「缺水」，市場資金供應鏈一旦出現問題，很可能誘發金融危機。
中共中央智囊、清華大學經濟管理學院教授魏傑10月25日在北京一論壇上發表演講。他表示，明年中國經濟下行壓力仍大，且面臨還債高峰期，中共2014年至2016年「大放水」導致負債太高，2018年至2020年是中共的還債高峰期。
據中共國家外匯管理局9月27日公布的數據顯示，截至6月底，中共全口徑外債餘額升至1.9980萬億元（不包括香港、澳門對外負債）。
魏傑指出，最大的危機在於資金「缺水」，一旦資金供應鏈出現問題，資金供給不正常，就會發生大量的債務危機，很可能誘發金融危機。這可能是明年一隻最大的「黑天鵝」。
他提出要保障資金供給正常，首先要控制去槓桿的力度，力度太大會導致企業的資金緊張，會導致債務危機和資金鏈斷裂。
其次，明年應該實行穩健的貨幣政策，不能超發貨幣。再有，必須穩定股市，股市如果不能穩定，資金供給一定會出問題。
第四，要穩住滙率，如果本幣穩不住，資金供給就穩不住。
最後，要穩定房地產產業，近年金融機構把大量資金都扔到房地產裡面，如果房地產繼續吸納這麼大量的資金的話，那麼明年的資金供給一定會出問題。
不過，評論人士文小剛認為，中共對於資金「缺水」問題，面臨兩難。如果中共利用降息、降准向市場放水，投入大量資金，會造成人民幣貶值，資金流出，外匯儲備減少。
而且，今年初以來中共央行一直在向市場放水，但經濟依然持續下行，顯示在經濟萎縮的大環境下，企業在控制借貸，不願意擴張生產。
但是如果央行不放水，不提供資金，就會造成債務違約大量發生，從而造成企業融資困難，股市也會因為資金短缺動盪下跌。
現在美國、加拿大、澳大利亞、紐西蘭等20多個國家央行都在降息，但中共央行一直按兵不動，顯示當局擔心降息會造成經濟動盪。
此外，魏傑還在演講中提到，9月中共外匯儲備量已下降到3.09萬億美金，排除借來的錢和外商投資的錢，真正能動用的僅有幾千億美元左右。
他表示，一旦外匯供給出現波動，必然影響到本幣，影響到國內的資金供給。
普林斯頓社會學博士、政治與經濟學者程曉農也指出，中共外匯儲備只剩下幾千億美元可動用。
程曉農10月25日在《大紀元》刊文說，中共雖然有3萬億美元的外匯儲備，但外匯儲備確實吃緊，因為中共必須償還近2萬億美元的外債；另外，外商在華投資已接近6000億美元，而中美經貿談判一年多以來不少外企開始陸續撤資，它們撤資和利潤匯出所需外匯也是一筆巨大的開支，在對外開放金融的情況下，當局不敢扣住這筆外匯不放手。
「扣除這兩筆硬開支，外匯儲備只剩下幾千億美元可動用，而中共長期靠從美國每年淨賺幾千億美元來補充外匯儲備的路子已經中斷，今後每年進口石油、糧食、製造業零部件等經濟必需品的外匯支出很快會把剩下那幾千億美元耗盡。所以，中共的外匯捉襟見肘，已經亮在了桌面上。」
而據日本大和證券估計，如果計算中共官方未列入計算的項目，中共外債可能高達3萬億至3.5萬億美元。這意味著中共能動用的外匯儲備幾乎為零。

The CCP think tank exposes the biggest crisis next year: funds are ""water shortage""

02 Nov 2019, 09:06

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] China’s economic downturn, foreign capital flight, declining foreign exchange reserves, and the depreciation of the renminbi have all had a serious impact on China’s finance. Some mainland scholars have said that next year will be the peak period for the CCP’s debt repayment, the biggest crisis. In the case of funds “lack of water”, once there is a problem in the market capital supply chain, it is likely to induce a financial crisis.
Wei Jie, a think tank of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and a professor at the School of Economics and Management of Tsinghua University, delivered a speech at a forum in Beijing on October 25. He said that the downward pressure on China's economy will remain large next year and it will face the peak of debt repayment. The CCP's ""large release of water"" from 2014 to 2016 led to high debt, and the CCP's debt repayment period from 2018 to 2020.
According to data released by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on September 27, as of the end of June, the balance of the CCP's full-scale foreign debt rose to 1.9980 trillion yuan (excluding Hong Kong and Macao's external liabilities).
Wei Jie pointed out that the biggest crisis lies in the lack of funds. If there is a problem in the supply chain and the supply of funds is not normal, a large debt crisis will occur, which may trigger a financial crisis. This may be the biggest ""black swan"" next year.
He proposed to ensure the normal supply of funds. First, we must control the intensity of de-leveraging. Too much intensity will lead to tight capital, which will lead to debt crisis and capital chain breakage.
Second, a prudent monetary policy should be implemented next year, and no currency should be issued. Moreover, the stock market must be stabilized. If the stock market is not stable, the supply of funds will definitely go wrong.
Fourth, we must stabilize the exchange rate. If the local currency is stable, the supply of funds will not be stable.
Finally, to stabilize the real estate industry, financial institutions have thrown large amounts of money into real estate in recent years. If real estate continues to absorb such a large amount of funds, then the supply of funds next year will definitely be problematic.
However, commentator Wen Xiaogang believes that the CCP faces a dilemma in the issue of ""water shortage"". If the CCP uses the interest rate cuts, the RRR cuts, and the large amount of funds invested, it will cause the RMB to depreciate, the funds flow out, and the foreign exchange reserves will decrease.
Moreover, since the beginning of this year, the central bank of the Communist Party of China has been releasing water to the market, but the economy continues to decline. It shows that under the economic contraction, enterprises are controlling lending and are unwilling to expand production.
However, if the central bank does not release water and does not provide funds, it will result in a large number of debt defaults, which will make the financing of enterprises difficult, and the stock market will also fall due to the shortage of funds.
At present, the central banks of more than 20 countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are all cutting interest rates, but the central bank of the Chinese Communist Party has been standing still, indicating that the authorities are worried that the interest rate cut will cause economic turmoil.
In addition, Wei Jie also mentioned in his speech that in September the CCP’s foreign exchange reserves had dropped to 3.09 trillion US dollars, excluding borrowed money and foreign-invested money, and only about a few hundred billion dollars could be used.
He said that once the foreign exchange supply fluctuates, it will inevitably affect the local currency and affect the domestic supply of funds.
Cheng Xiaonong, a Ph.D. in sociology and psychology at Princeton, also pointed out that the CCP’s foreign exchange reserves are only a few hundred billion dollars left to be used.
Cheng Xiaonong said in the ""Epoch Times"" on October 25 that although the CCP has 3 trillion US dollars in foreign exchange reserves, foreign exchange reserves are indeed tight because the CCP must repay nearly 2 trillion US dollars of foreign debts. In addition, foreign investors have invested in China. Nearly 600 billion U.S. dollars, and many foreign companies have begun to withdraw funds in the Sino-US economic and trade negotiations for more than a year. Their foreign exchange and the remittance of foreign exchange required for profits are also a huge expense. In the case of opening up to the outside world, the authorities dare not hold this. Foreign exchange does not let go.
""After deducting these two hard expenditures, only a few hundred billion US dollars of foreign exchange reserves can be used. The CCP has long relied on the US to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year to supplement foreign exchange reserves. The way to import oil, grain and manufacturing every year. Foreign exchange spending on economic necessities such as spare parts will soon run out of the remaining hundreds of billions of dollars. Therefore, the CCP’s foreign exchange is stretched out and is on the table.""
According to Japan’s Daiwa Securities, if the CCP officially does not include the calculated items, the CCP’s external debt may be as high as 3 trillion to 3.5 trillion US dollars. This means that the CCP's available foreign exchange reserves are almost zero.
