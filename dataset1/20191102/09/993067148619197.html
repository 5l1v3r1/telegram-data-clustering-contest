      <p>This year, she spent hours having a team of experts transform her into a bizarre Frankenstein’s monster-like creature for her New York event.</p>
      <p>She told People magazine: “The inspiration is Tokio Hotel, which is the band of my husband. They believe in aliens.”</p>
      <p>The couple arrived at the party in a giant glass vehicle with a bio-hazard warning on the side, and Klum’s husband Tom Kaulitz said of his character: “I was in space looking for a new planet for humans to live on, right? Cause we already discarded ours.”</p>

      <p>“I brought her home. So, hopefully, she has some useful information planned.”</p>
      <p>Klum said the couple start planning their costumes for the event a full year in advance, saying: “As they’re taking this [costume] off, I start thinking about next year,</p>
