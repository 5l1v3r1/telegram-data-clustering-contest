      <h2>Tina Watson, laid to rest at Gilroes Crematorium in Leicester, had a 'wicked sense of humour' according to her family</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T09:29:10+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 09:29</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, Adrian Troughton, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>A woman who drank 40 cups of tea a day was buried in a giant box of her favourite brand.</p>
      <p>Before Tina Watson died of heart failure she was very clear about how she wanted to be sent off.</p>
      <p>For the whole of her life the Leicester woman had harboured an intense and enduring love of tea, <a href="https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/mum-buried-coffin-looks-like-3493098">Leicester Mercury reported.</a></p>
      <p>At its peak she was knocking back 40 cups a day, which equated to a fresh brew every 24 minutes if she slept an average amount.</p>
      <p>Tina first announced her intentions to be buried in a Typhoo box to her daughter Debs Donovan.</p>

      <p>“It’s typical of mum,” said Debs, of Braunstone Town, Leicestershire.</p>
      <p>“She had a wicked sense of humour and drank about 30 or 40 cups of tea a day, every day. She just loved having a cuppa.</p>
      <p>“We got chatting about her coffin after the funeral of my stepdad Peter four years ago.</p>
      <p>“She just blurted out: ‘I want to be buried in a coffin that looks like a giant box of tea bags.’</p>
      <p>“I burst out laughing and said: ‘Okay, but it's got to be Typhoo because you only get an ‘oo’ with Typhoo.</p>

      <p>"Mum cracked up at that and we just fell about laughing. She said she was deadly serious about the coffin so that was that.”</p>
      <p>The curious final request was realised by funeral director Paul Pender.</p>
      <p>He said: “It was one of our more unusual requests but we were happy to be able to make it happen.</p>
      <p>“I got in touch with the guy that helps us with customised coffins and he produced the goods.</p>
      <p>“It is always nice when the customer gets what the customer wants.”</p>

      <p>Family and friends of the tea enthusiast said their final goodbyes at Gilroes Crematorium in Leicester on Friday.</p>
      <p>Despite keeping her wicked sense of humour until the last, Tina did not have the easiest of lifes.</p>
      <p>She was twice diagnosed with cancer and beat it both times, before having both of her legs amputated.</p>
      <p>“She lost one leg after the bite got infected after being bitten by an insect in Spain 14 years ago,” said Debs.</p>
      <p>“Mum then lost the other leg when the infection spread further.</p>
      <p>"She never let anything get her down. She always saw the funny side of things even when there wasn’t a funny side.”</p>
