[Update 2: Snapdragon 730G] Xiaomi shows off Mi Watch UI and Mi CC9 Pro’s 50x zoom capability
02 Nov 2019, 09:15 by Aamir Siddiqui

Update (11/2/19 @ 9:15 AM ET): Xiaomi has confirmed that the Mi CC9 Pro / Mi Note 10 will come with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G SoC, and has shared some more details on its camera.Update (11/1/19 @ 11:10 AM ET): Widely assumed to be called the “Mi Watch,” Xiaomi has seemingly confirmed the name with a GitHub repo. Scroll to the bottom for updates. The article as published on October 30, 2019, is preserved as below.

Xiaomi is in full teaser mode for the launch of its upcoming smartphone, smartwatch and smart TV, as the company continues to drip-feed information about the products before the official unveiling. Taking to its official Weibo channels, Xiaomi has revealed more information on the products, as well as shown some of their highlight features.
Xiaomi Mi Watch
Starting off on the new information since the last post, Xiaomi has confirmed that the Mi Watch will come with the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 3100 Platform.



Thanks to the eSIM capabilities of the watch as well as the presence of a speaker, we guessed that users will be able to place calls from the smartwatch. Xiaomi confirmed the same as well. The company also released more official product renders, giving us a good look at the watch from several angles.



The Mi Watch looks like an Apple Watch, but has some more sharpness in its design, trading away the pleasant curves. I would personally have preferred a bevel or a chamfer on the lower edges, which would have made the watch more comfortable to wear.
Xiaomi also showed off a few screen previews of the OS on the watch.



With the Mi Watch, Xiaomi envisages a smartwatch that is basically a miniaturized smartphone, with the ability to install apps, control your smart home and more. Xiaomi is calling the UX as MIUI for Watch.



In the video above, we can see the UX on the Mi Watch. The user is utilizing the crown button to scroll through a list of installed apps, opens a video player, and plays a video on the smartwatch. Why would one want to watch a video on such a small display, that is a question that we are unable to answer. You can, in case you want to.
Xiaomi Mi CC9 Pro / Mi Note 10
Xiaomi has also shown off the white color variant of the upcoming Mi CC9 Pro.



Additionally, the company also confirmed the curved edges of the display on the smartphone, as well as the flat bottom, and what appears to be the 3.5mm headphone jack.



The company also showed off the 50x zoom capabilities of the Mi CC9 Pro in a separate video.



We have already seen various different smartphones implement optical zoom solutions, so that alone isn’t as unique. What is unique is the fact that the optical zoom implementation exists alongside other camera technologies, increasing the versatility of the smartphone.
The Mi CC9 Pro is also coming to Europe as the Mi Note 10 on November 10, 2019.

Update: Mi Watch name confirmed
As mentioned numerous times in the original post above, it was widely assumed that Xiaomi’s watch would be called the “Mi Watch.” Now it seems Xiaomi has confirmed that name by opening a GitHub repo titled “MiWatch_Kernel_Opensource.” Nothing has been uploaded yet, but it does essentially confirm the name of the smartwatch. We will be keeping an eye on this repo to see if Xiaomi uploads anything.

Update 2: Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G SoC Confirmed
The Xiaomi Mi CC9 Pro, aka the Mi Note 10, has been rumored to come with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G SoC, and now Xiaomi has finally confirmed the same.



The company also shared that two of the five rear cameras (telephoto and primary) will come with four-axis OIS. The front camera is also said to be 32MP. Other sources have shared sensor model numbers for the device as well: the primary camera is the 108MP S5KHMX sensor, the 20MP wide-angle camera is the IMX350, the 12MP dedicated portrait camera is the S5K2L7 sensor, while the 5MP telephoto camera is the OV08A10.
