澳門旅客人數增速下降 料博彩業收入錄負增長｜國泰君安
02 Nov 2019, 09:00 by 投資
由於香港的社會事件對赴港旅遊產生負面影響，同時赴澳門旅遊人數的增速也在下降，因此將2019年澳門博彩毛收入的增長預測將從3.8%下調至-2.6%，行業評級下調至「中性」。

今年截至6月份，香港累計接待遊客3,490萬人次，同比增長13.9%，其中2,760萬人次來自內地，同比增長16.4%。在同一時間段內，前往澳門的遊客人數同比增長20.6%至2,020萬人次。
在7月初，隨著反修例運動的升級，7月份赴港旅遊人數同比下降4.8%，8月份赴港旅遊人數更同比大幅下降39.1%，為2003年「沙士」爆發以來最大的單月跌幅。隨著負面影響蔓延到澳門，7月、8月以及9月赴澳門旅遊人數同比增速分別降至16.3%、6.5%和8%。
港珠澳大橋效益放緩
今年截至8月份，前往澳門的遊客數量同比增長18%至2,740萬人次；相對2018年創新高的3,580萬遊客人次，澳門原有望在2019年輕鬆刷新紀錄。事實上，自2018年10月24日港珠澳大橋開通以來，赴澳門遊客數量快速增長；然而，遊客數量的增長預期將在今年餘下時間顯著放緩。在地緣政治和宏觀經濟前景惡化的情況下，澳門博彩的毛收入（GGR）增長亦不那麼樂觀。過去幾個月以來，中美貿易戰不斷升級，中美貿易關係亦持續惡化，美國甚至將中國列為匯率操縱國。
在2019年前八個月間，持續進行的貿易戰導致美國從中國的進口同比下降12.5%，這拖累了澳門博彩業的收入增長以及估值。全球股市也正在變得越來越不穩定，將帶來負面的財富效應，降低人們對澳門博彩業的興趣，特別是對於貴賓分部而言。2019年前九個月，澳門的博彩毛收入同比下降1.7%，增長率在第一季度和第二季度分別為-0.5%和-0.5%，在第三季度則擴大至-3.5%。在最近的7月、8月及9月，博彩毛收入同比增長率分別為-3.5%、-8.6%和0.6%。儘管9月份錄得了略為正面的增速，但這亦不是一個積極的訊號，主要是由於2018年9月份的比較基數很低。
當日澳門的賭場由於颱風山竹吹襲而關閉超過24小時，導致去年9月赴澳門旅遊人數同比增速僅為3%，遠低於2018年全年的9.8%增速，對去年9月的博彩毛收入產生了負面影響。
2019年第一季度、第二季度和第三季度，貴賓分部業務博彩毛收入分別同比下降13.4%、15.6%和22.5%，分別佔博彩毛收入的48.9%、47.2%和43.9%。與之相反，中場分部業務的博彩毛收入在2019年第一季度、第二季度和第三季度分別增長16.1%、18.6%和17.7%。貴賓分部業務的表現下滑，主要是由於貴賓賭客避險的觀望態度，而中場分部業務的持續強勁增長則是由於去年10月開通的港珠澳大橋帶來的強勁客流增長。但現在大橋的開通運營已滿一年，預計客流的增長將放緩。

Macau's passenger growth rate declines, the gaming industry revenues record negative growth | Guotai Junan
02 Nov 2019, 09:00 by Investment
As the social events in Hong Kong have a negative impact on Hong Kong's tourism, and the growth rate of tourists to Macau is also declining, the growth forecast for Macau's gaming gross income will be lowered from 3.8% to -2.6% in 2019, and the industry rating will be lowered to ""neutral"".

As of June this year, Hong Kong received a total of 34.9 million tourists, a year-on-year increase of 13.9%, of which 27.6 million came from the mainland, an increase of 16.4%. During the same period, the number of visitors to Macau increased by 20.6% year-on-year to 20.2 million.
In early July, with the upgrade of the anti-reform movement, the number of tourists visiting Hong Kong fell by 4.8% year-on-year in July. The number of tourists to Hong Kong in August dropped by 39.1% year-on-year, the largest single month since the outbreak of SARS in 2003. Decline. As the negative effects spread to Macau, the year-on-year growth rate of tourists to Macau in July, August and September fell to 16.3%, 6.5% and 8% respectively.
Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge slows down
As of August this year, the number of visitors to Macau increased by 18% year-on-year to 27.4 million. Compared with the record high of 35.8 million visitors in 2018, Macao originally expected to set a new record in 2019. In fact, since the opening of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge on October 24, 2018, the number of visitors to Macau has grown rapidly; however, the growth in the number of tourists is expected to slow significantly during the rest of the year. In the case of geopolitical and macroeconomic prospects, the growth in gross profit (GGR) of Macau gaming is also less optimistic. In the past few months, the Sino-US trade war has escalated and Sino-US trade relations have continued to deteriorate. The United States has even listed China as a currency manipulator.
In the first eight months of 2019, the ongoing trade war led to a 12.5% drop in US imports from China, which dragged down the revenue growth and valuation of the Macau gaming industry. Global stock markets are also becoming more and more unstable, which will bring negative wealth effects and reduce people's interest in the Macau gaming industry, especially for the VIP segment. In the first nine months of 2019, Macau's gaming gross revenue fell by 1.7% year-on-year, with growth rates of -0.5% and -0.5% in the first quarter and second quarter, respectively, and -3.5% in the third quarter. In the most recent July, August and September, the gross growth rate of gross gaming revenue was -3.5%, -8.6% and 0.6%, respectively. Although a slightly positive growth rate was recorded in September, this is not a positive signal, mainly due to the low base of comparison in September 2018.
On the same day, Macau's casinos were closed for more than 24 hours due to typhoon mansions. As a result, the number of tourists to Macau in September last year was only 3%, which was much lower than the 9.8% growth rate in 2018, and the gambling last September. Gross income has had a negative impact.
In the first quarter, second quarter and third quarter of 2019, VIP revenue of VIP segment business decreased by 13.4%, 15.6% and 22.5%, respectively, accounting for 48.9%, 47.2% and 43.9% of the gross revenue of gaming. In contrast, the gross gaming revenue of the midfield segment business increased by 16.1%, 18.6% and 17.7% in the first quarter, second quarter and third quarter of 2019, respectively. The decline in the performance of the VIP segment business was mainly due to the wait-and-see attitude of VIP gamblers, and the continued strong growth of the mid-market segment business was due to the strong passenger flow growth brought by the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge opened in October last year. However, the opening of the bridge has now been completed for one year, and the growth of passenger flow is expected to slow down.
