      <h3>St Hilda’s Way, North Yorkshire</h3>
      <p>A thoroughly modern pilgrimage route, this 40-mile waymarked path was opened four years ago to celebrate the life of the seventh-century local heroine. The route goes in a semi-circle from Hinderwell near the coast, up on to the North York Moors, and down the Esk Valley to Whitby Abbey. On the way it takes in no fewer than eight churches dedicated to St Hilda, a fine Yorkshire “trod” – a stone pannierway indented by medieval wayfarers and their packhorses – and stepping stones over the River Esk at Lealholm.<br/><b>Further information</b> Walking St Hilda’s Way, £5 plus p&amp;p from <a href="http://www.dalescourtpress.co.uk/pages/Books_Dales_Court_Press.html">dalescourtpress.co.uk</a>.<br/><b>Getting there</b> From <a href="https://www.northernrailway.co.uk/stations/SLB">Saltburn station</a> take the <a href="https://www.arrivabus.co.uk/north-east/services/x4---sapphire---middlesbrough-to-loftus-x4-loftus-to-whitby-x4/">X4 bus</a> to Hinderwell. There are rail links to Middlesbrough from Whitby.<br/><b>Where to stay</b> Weary pilgrims will find the sauna at the 16th-century Fox and Hounds in Ainthorpe most welcome (doubles from £90 B&amp;B, <a href="https://www.foxandhoundsainthorpe.com/">foxandhounds-ainthorpe.com</a>).</p>
      <h3>St Duthac’s Way, eastern Scotland</h3>

      <p>A lesser-known route to St Andrews, the 91-mile St Duthac’s Way starts at Aberdeen. Not a great deal is known about the 11th-century Scottish saint, but centuries after his death his body was found incorrupt (avoiding the normal process of decomposition). If your own body is similarly robust and you fancy a tougher challenge, you could start off at Tain – 135 miles north-west of Aberdeen – where the shrine to St Duthac was itself once a pilgrimage site.<br/><b>Further information</b> <a href="https://www.thewayofstandrews.com/route/routes-and-photos/st-duthacs-way/">thewayofstandrews.com</a><br/><b>Getting there</b> Aberdeen and Tain <a href="https://www.scotrail.co.uk/">have railway stations</a> and St Andrews is served by Leuchars station, a 10-minute bus ride way on the number <a href="https://moffat-williamson.co.uk/moffat-and-williamson-timetables">92</a> or <a href="https://www.stagecoachbus.com/plan-a-journey/journey-results?a%5BCategory%5D=locality&amp;a%5BGeocode%5D%5BGrid%5D%5Bvalue%5D=WGS84&amp;a%5BGeocode%5D%5BLongitude%5D=-2.891953843727665&amp;a%5BGeocode%5D%5BLatitude%5D=56.37603930006757&amp;a%5BFullText%5D=Leuchars+Rail+Station%2C+Fife&amp;a%5BLocalityData%5D%5BLocalityId%5D=ZYX26371&amp;a%5Bid%5D=Leuchars+Rail+Station%2C+Fife&amp;b%5BCategory%5D=locality&amp;b%5BGeocode%5D%5BGrid%5D%5Bvalue%5D=WGS84&amp;b%5BGeocode%5D%5BLongitude%5D=-2.802640277213012&amp;b%5BGeocode%5D%5BLatitude%5D=56.3406040062087&amp;b%5BFullText%5D=St+Andrews+Bus+Station%2C+Fife&amp;b%5BLocalityData%5D%5BLocalityId%5D=ZYX26309&amp;b%5Bid%5D=St+Andrews+Bus+Station%2C+Fife&amp;c=true&amp;d=2019-11-04T12%3A00%3A00.000Z&amp;e=Leuchars+Rail+Station%2C+Fife&amp;f=St+Andrews+Bus+Station%2C+Fife&amp;g%5BADULT%5D=1&amp;g%5Btotal%5D=1">99</a>.<br/><b>Where to stay</b> Dundee Backpackers Hostel is in five buildings dating from the 16th century and offers private rooms and four-, six- and eight-bed dorms (from £17 a night, <a href="https://hoppo.com/dundeebackpackershostel">hoppo.com/dundeebackpackershostel</a>).</p>

      <p>The “Welsh Camino” is a 136-mile waymarked walk across the woods, rivers and mountains of north Wales, from Flintshire’s Basingwerk Abbey – and the holy waters of St Winifride’s Well – to Bardsey Island, off the tip of the Llŷn peninsula. The little isle has been the focus of pilgrimages ever since St Cadfan founded a religious community there in the sixth century. Today it’s also a <a href="https://www.bardsey.org/wildlife">national nature reserve</a> open from March to October, making it a perfect summer destination.<br/><b>Further information</b> <a href="http://pilgrims-way-north-wales.org/">pilgrims-way-north-wales.org</a><br/><b>Getting there</b> From <a href="https://tfwrail.wales/stations/flint">Flint </a><a href="https://tfwrail.wales/stations/flint">station</a>, take <a href="https://www.arrivabus.co.uk/wales/services/11c-11f-11m-11x---rhyl-to-holywell/?direction=outbound">bus 11</a> or <a href="http://www.polloydcoaches.co.uk/bus-services/">19</a> to Holywell.

      </figure>
      <p>Tradition has it that the Saints’ Way (<i>Forth an Syns</i> in Cornish) was used by early Christian pilgrims from Ireland and Wales. They crossed Cornwall from north to south before sailing to Brittany and sacred sites beyond. Around 28 miles long, the well-waymarked path starts at <a href="https://padstowparishchurch.org.uk/">St Petroc’s </a><a href="https://padstowparishchurch.org.uk/">church</a> in Padstow and ends at the church of <a href="https://www.foweyparishchurch.org/">St Fimbarrus in Fowey</a>. Highlights on the way include 360-degree vistas from St Breock Downs, stone crosses raised by Celtic Christians and a holy well at Golant. <br/><b>Further information</b> <a href="https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/environment-and-planning/countryside/cycle-routes-and-trails/the-saints-way/">cornwall.gov.uk</a><br/><b>Getting there</b> From <a href="https://www.gwr.com/plan-journey/stations-and-routes/par">Par </a><a href="https://www.gwr.com/plan-journey/stations-and-routes/par">station</a> take the <a href="https://www.firstgroup.com/uploads/update-attach/25-winter201819.pdf">25 bus to Fowey</a>.

      <p>You’ve got to respect a pilgrimage route that has the audacity to treat Canterbury not as a destination but as a mere staging post. The newly devised, 70-mile St Augustine’s Camino – a guidebook and pilgrim’s passport were launched this year – sets out from Rochester Cathedral bound for Augustus Pugin’s recently renovated St Augustine shrine in Ramsgate. It visits the <a href="https://thefriars.org.uk/home">Carmelite Friars at Aylesford Priory</a> and takes in swathes of lush Kent countryside, stopping off at Canterbury before pushing on to the coast.<br/><b>Further information</b> <a href="http://augustinecamino.co.uk/">augustinecamino.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://augustinecamino.co.uk/guidebooks/">guidebook</a> £5.99 plus £2 p&amp;p<br/><b>Getting there</b> Both <a href="https://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/travel-information/more-travel-help/station-information/stations/rochester">Rochester</a> (from 30min) and <a href="https://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/travel-information/more-travel-help/station-information/stations/Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a> (from 1hr 12min) have direct rail services to London.<br/><b>Where to stay</b> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/02/albion-house-ramsgate-hotel-review">Ramsgate’s 18th-century Albion House</a> is dripping in history and was once graced by Princess Victoria (doubles from £85 room-only, <a href="https://albionhouseramsgate.co.uk/">albionhouseramsgate.co.uk</a>).</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Once one of Europe’s busiest pilgrimage sites, this shrine was created in 1061 after Saint Mary appeared to one Richeldis de Faverches and asked her to build a replica of the house where the Annunciation took place. The statue was destroyed in the Reformation but trekking to “England’s Nazareth” was revived in the early 20th century. The 125-mile route from London takes in Waltham Abbey, Newmarket, Brandon, Swaffham and Castle Acre priory.<br/><b>Further information </b><a href="https://www.walsinghamvillage.org/">walsinghamvillage.org</a><br/><b>Getting there</b> Starting points with transport links include London’s Westminster Abbey (125 miles), Lincoln (90 miles) and Norwich (28 miles).

      <p>Follow in the footsteps of St Finbarr from the Top of the Rock in Drimoleague, County Cork, where the sixth-century monk gave an impassioned sermon, to the sumptuous lake at Gougane Barra, where he built an island monastery. It may be a journey of just 23 miles but it crosses three mountain ranges as it doglegs through west Cork. An added challenge is the distinct lack of accommodation along the way. So prepare yourself for a very long day, or make a diversion to Ballylickey on the coast.<br/><b>Further information</b> <a href="https://www.pilgrimpath.ie/pilgrim-paths-day/st-finbarrs-pilgrim-path-cork/">pilgrimpath.ie</a><br/><b>Getting there</b> From Cork, take the <a href="https://www.buseireann.ie/inner.php?id=406&amp;form-view-timetables-from=&amp;form-view-timetables-to=&amp;form-view-timetables-route=236&amp;form-view-timetables-submit=1">236 bus to Drimoleague</a>.

      <p>Over 500 years ago, the village of Prusac was saved from drought after devout Muslim Ajvaz Dedo prayed for 40 days until a rock on a nearby mountain split open, revealing a spring. Ever since, Muslims have gathered in Prusac on 30 June to give thanks in Europe’s largest Islamic pilgrimage. Traditionally, the faithful ride on horseback in folk costume, though that’s not obligatory. From Sarajevo, the 120km route heads north-west across a hilly forested region, through Bugojno, with its 17th-century Sultan Ahmed mosque.<br/><b>Further information</b> <a href="https://www.visitmycountry.net/bosnia_herzegovina/en/index.php/tourism/religious/92-turizam/vjerski/888-ajvatovica">visitmycountry.net</a><br/><b>Getting there</b> <a href="https://www.zfbh.ba/en/">Sarajevo is served by railway</a> and <a href="https://getbybus.com/en/bus-from-sarajevo#sarajevo-bus-terminal">international buses</a>.

      <p>Part of the <a href="https://www.ruritage.eu/role-models/via-maria/">Via Mariae</a> network in central and eastern Europe, this route runs for 62 mountainous miles from the salt-mining town of Praid (pictured) in the Carpathian basin to the Marian shrine at Șumuleu Ciuc, via numerous villages and churches. It celebrates a medieval priest called István, who went out to meet the army of King János Zsigmond and persuaded him to turn back rather than invade. In gratitude to Mary for this boon, he led a pilgrimage every Pentecost.<br/><b>Further information</b> <a href="https://100km.mariaut.ro/node/578">100km.mariaut.ro</a><br/><b>Getting there</b> From Bucharest, <a href="https://www.cfrcalatori.ro/">take a train to Miercurea Ciuc</a>, then a <a href="https://balinttrans.autogari.ro/?lang=en">bus to Praid</a>.

      <p>A 152-mile route through North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate, the Via Coloniensis heads more or less north-south from Cologne to Trier. Though sometimes incorporated into walks from northern Europe to Santiago de Compostela, it works as a discrete pilgrimage. Passing the spa town of Bad Münstereifel and the former Benedictine abbey at Prüm, it ends at Trier’s St Peter’s Cathedral. This happens to be the oldest church in Germany, commissioned by Emperor Constantine in the fourth century (though since destroyed and rebuilt).<br/><b>Getting there</b> Cologne’s central station is opposite the cathedral and only 4-5<a href="https://www.eurostar.com/uk-en/train/germany/london-to-cologne"> hours from London by train</a>. Trier also has a station.<br/><b>Where to stay</b> Treat yourself to a night at the modern but stylish Boutique Hotel Marielle in Bad Münstereifel (doubles from €90 roon-only, <a href="https://hotel-marielle.de/">hotel-marielle.de</a>).</p>

      <p>It’s a little-known fact that the first incident in Finnish history that was written down occurred on 20 January 1156, when Bishop Henry was murdered by a yeoman named Lalli on the ice of Lake Köyliönjärvi. The tiny wooded island of Kirkkokari, near the scene of the crime, has attracted pilgrims ever since. Join Finnish Catholics as they walk or cycle 87 miles from the port of Turku to Köyliö, on the waymarked St Henry’s Way, to take a boat across the lake for a memorial mass on the Sunday before the summer solstice.<br/><b>Getting there</b> Turku is accessible by <a href="https://www.vikingline.com/viking-line-cargo/booking-and-contact/harbours/turku/">ferry</a> and <a href="https://www.vr.fi/cs/vr/en/turku_en">train</a>. It’s a six-mile walk from lakeside Polsu to Säkylä, from where the <a href="https://www.onnibus.com/aikataulut">F21 Flex bus runs to Turku</a>.<br/><b>Where to stay</b> Villa Haapsaari in Säkylä overlooks Lake Pyhäjärvi (doubles £86, <a href="https://huvilahaapsaari.fi/in-english/">huvilahaapsaari.fi</a>).</p>

      <p>A lung-busting 111-mile adventure up and down mountains, this trek begins at the Romedikirchl in the village of Thaur and slips over the border to the church of San Romedio in Italy’s Val di Non. Passing through the North Tirol, pilgrims follow in the footsteps of St Romedius, a young man who gave up his well-to-do life to meditate in a cave. He is said to have made the journey astride a bear, which for some reason became tame after killing his horse.<br/><b>Further information</b> <a href="https://www.tyrol.com/things-to-do/sports/hiking/hiking-tours/a-romedius-pilgrimage-trail">tyrol.com</a><br/><b>Getting there</b> Take the frequent <a href="https://efa.vvt.at/vvtadr/TTB/D_00005dc4_TP.pdf">501</a> or <a href="https://efa.vvt.at/vvtadr/TTB/D_0000305d_TP.pdf">503</a> bus from <a href="https://westbahn.at/en">Innsbruck </a><a href="https://westbahn.at/en">railway station</a> to Thaur.

      <p>Having the Virgin Mary appear to you once would be something, but in 1933 a girl called Mariette Beco claimed to have had eight encounters. She said the Virgin had shown her a spring with curative powers. By 1949, so many reports of healings had been made that the site received the imprimatur of the Catholic church. Pilgrims have been going there ever since for physical and spiritual restoration. The route starts at Beauraing on the French border and heads 60 miles north-east across the forests and hills of the northern Ardennes.<br/><b>Further information</b> <a href="https://www.pilgrim-info.com/banneux/">pilgrim-info.com/banneux</a><br/><b>Getting there</b> <a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/stations-and-train/search-a-station/17/beauraing.aspx">Beauraing has a </a><a href="http://www.belgianrail.be/en/stations-and-train/search-a-station/17/beauraing.aspx">station</a>.

For over 1,000 years pilgrims have trodden this path, which was once the main route from northern to southern Europe. With the Pilgrims’ Passport (€5), their modern counterparts have access to a huge number of cheap-and-cheerful lodgings along the way.<br/><b>Further information</b> <a href="https://www.viefrancigene.org/en/">viefrancigene.org</a><br/><b>Getting there</b> Lausanne, Vevey, St Maurice and other popular starting points all have railway stations.<br/><b>Where to stay</b> La Casa del Movimento Lento (the Slow Movement House) in Roppolo, north of Turin, is a B&amp;B/hostel with a library of travel books and maps (bed in three-bed dorm €16, doubles €46, linen extra, <a href="https://www.casa.movimentolento.it/en/prezzi/">casa.movimentolento.it</a>).</p>
      <p>• This article was amended on 4 November 2019. St Andrews, at the end of St Duthac’s Way, does not have a railway station, as was originally stated. The nearest station to St Andrews is Leuchars, a bus ride away. It was also amended to clarify Eurostar’s train ticket policy for Belgian stations.</p>
