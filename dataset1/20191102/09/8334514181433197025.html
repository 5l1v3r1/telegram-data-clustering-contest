      <p>GAZA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Palestinian militants fired a barrage of rockets at Israel and the Israeli military responded with a wave of pre-dawn air strikes in Gaza killing one man on Saturday, Palestinian and Israeli officials said.</p>
      <p>The Israeli army said it targeted sites belonging to Hamas, the Islamist militant group which rules Gaza, after Palestinians fired 10 rockets into Israel late on Friday.</p>
      <p>Eight of them were intercepted by missile defense systems. One projectile hit a house in a town near the border, causing damage but not casualties, police said.</p>
      <p>In southern Gaza, medical officials and locals said a small cabin was hit, killing a 27-year-old civilian and wounding two others.</p>
      <p>None of the armed groups in Gaza claimed responsibility for firing the rockets. The Israeli military said Hamas was ultimately responsible for the attack.</p>
      <p>Israel and Hamas have fought three wars over the past decade and cross-border tensions are high and such flare-ups are not rare.</p>
      <p>Israel pulled its troops and settlers from the narrow coastal strip in 2005 but keeps the enclave under a blockade, citing security concerns. About 2 million Palestinians live in Gaza.</p>
