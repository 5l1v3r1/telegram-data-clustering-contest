抖音疑將個資傳到中國 紐時：美政府啟動調查

（中央社記者尹俊傑紐約1日專電）中國短影音平台TikTok（抖音）近年人氣竄升，但遭質疑審查內容並外洩個資。紐約時報今天引述知情人士報導，美國政府已就TikTok母公司兩年前收購美企一案發動國安調查。
據報導，TikTok在美國影響力日深，多位國會議員近期關切並敦促政府調查。如今，美國外來投資審查委員會（CFIUS）正在調查TikTok母企業北京字節跳動科技有限公司（簡稱字節跳動）2017年11月以約10億美元收購美國社群媒體業者Musical.ly的交易案。
報導引述未具名知情人士透露，美國政府握有TikTok將資料傳送到中國的證據。
字節跳動收購Musical.ly時，這款對嘴歌唱影片應用程式（app）在歐美地區擁有約6000萬用戶。字節跳動當時承諾保有Musical.ly獨立性，但去年8月，字節跳動將Musical.ly併入TikTok，TikTok自此暴紅，過去12個月下載次數超過7.5億次。
字節跳動發言人表示，TikTok已表明取得美國用戶與主管機關信任無比重要，這項工作包含配合國會，TikTok致力配合，但不就進行中的監管程序發表意見。
報導指出，TikTok是在美中爭奪科技霸權的大背景下遭美方國安調查。中國不讓許多外國企業打進網路領域，但中國企業開發的尖端科技卻在世界各地日益風行。眾多美國國會議員與政府官員認為這對國安與經濟構成威脅，因而拉高中資收購美國企業與技術的門檻。
TikTok雖由中國企業經營，但平台上的影片大多源自西方用戶，部分原因在於TikTok國際版本沒有在中國大陸推出。字節跳動為中國用戶開發的類似程式名為抖音。
TikTok與中國關係匪淺、在美國人氣竄升，加上部分報導指TikTok上缺少香港民主抗爭內容、懷疑TikTok指示內容審查員過濾涉及政治議題的影片，近期引起華府政壇關切。



聯邦參議員盧比歐（Marco Rubio）10月致函兼任CFIUS主席的財政部長梅努欽（Steven Mnuchin），提到有充分證據顯示TikTok過濾中國政府視為敏感的內容。這份信函敦促CFIUS就字節跳動收購Muscial.ly一案發動國安調查。
字節跳動發言人堅稱中國政府沒有指示TikTok審查內容，TikTok內容方針是由美國團隊主導、不受任何政府影響。
但紐時報導引述曾任TikTok內容審查員的匿名人士指出，美國經理人曾指示TikTok內容審查員隱藏包含政治訊息或主題的影片，且不限於中國。TikTok內容方針是讓這類涉及政治的影片留在用戶個人頁面，但不會分享到TikTok貼文動態消息。
上週敦促美方調查TikTok的聯邦參議員舒默（Charles Schumer）今天表示，TikTok儲存可直通外國政府的大量個資，CFIUS發動國安調查顯示國會議員關切有所本，TikTok等應用程式恐對數以百萬計的美國人構成嚴重風險，應受更嚴密審查。（編輯：林憬屏）1081102

Shaking the voice to pass the money to China New Zealand: the US government launched an investigation
02 Nov 2019, 09:33 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Yin Junjie New York on the 1st special) China's short audio and video platform TikTok (vibration) has soared in recent years, but was questioned and reviewed and leaked capital. The New York Times quoted people familiar with the matter today as saying that the US government has launched a national security investigation on the case of the acquisition of US companies by the TikTok parent company two years ago.
According to reports, TikTok has a deep influence in the United States, and many members of Congress recently worried and urged the government to investigate. Today, the US Foreign Investment Review Board (CFIUS) is investigating the transaction of the TikTok parent company Beijing Byte Beat Technology Co., Ltd. (referred to as Byte Beat) in November 2017 to acquire US social media player Musical.ly for approximately US$1 billion.
According to the report, the unnamed person disclosed that the US government holds evidence that TikTok sent the information to China.
When the byte jumped to acquire Musical.ly, the mouth-singing video application (app) had about 60 million users in Europe and America. The bytebeat was promised to maintain Musical.ly independence at the time, but in August last year, bytebeats merged Musical.ly into TikTok, and TikTok has since become popular, with more than 750 million downloads in the past 12 months.
A bytebeat spokesperson said that TikTok has shown that it is extremely important to gain the trust of US users and the authorities. This work involves cooperating with Congress, TikTok, but does not comment on the ongoing regulatory process.
The report pointed out that TikTok was investigated by the US National Security in the context of the US-China competition for technology hegemony. China does not allow many foreign companies to enter the Internet, but the cutting-edge technology developed by Chinese companies is becoming increasingly popular around the world. Many US lawmakers and government officials believe that this poses a threat to the national security and the economy, thus raising the threshold for Chinese companies to acquire US companies and technology.
Although TikTok is operated by Chinese companies, most of the films on the platform originate from Western users, in part because the international version of TikTok has not been launched in mainland China. The byte jump is a similar program developed for Chinese users called vibrato.
TikTok has a very strong relationship with China and is soaring in the American economy. In addition, some reports indicate that the lack of Hong Kong's democratic content on TikTok and the suspicion that TikTok instructed content examiners to filter films involving political issues have recently caused concern in Washington politics.



In March, Federal Senator Marco Rubio sent a letter to Steven Mnuchin, the finance minister who served as chairman of CFIUS, and mentioned that there is sufficient evidence to show that TikTok filters what the Chinese government considers sensitive. The letter urged CFIUS to launch a national security investigation on the case of the beating of Muscial.ly.
The bytebeat spokesperson insisted that the Chinese government did not instruct TikTok to review the content, and the TikTok content policy was led by the US team and was not affected by any government.
But the New York Times quoted an anonymous person who had been a content inspector at TikTok as saying that American managers had instructed TikTok content examiners to hide films containing political messages or topics, and not limited to China. The TikTok content policy is to keep such political-related videos on the user's personal page, but will not share the TikTok post-motion news.
Federal Senator Charles Schumer, who urged the US to investigate TikTok last week, said today that TikTok stores a large amount of capital directly available to foreign governments. CFIUS launched a national security survey showing that members of Congress are concerned about this, and applications such as TikTok are afraid of hundreds. The tens of thousands of Americans pose a serious risk and should be subject to closer scrutiny. (Edit: Lin Yiping) 1081102
