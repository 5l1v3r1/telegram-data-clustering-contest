      <p>A man had to be rescued after his vehicle got stuck in a flooded street after heavy rains in Centurion on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>According to Deputy Chief Charles Mobaso, spokesperson for Tshwane Emergency Services, the man was attempting to cross a road in his bakkie when the vehicle became stuck on Rabie Street.</p>
      <p>Emergency services personnel were called out and rescued the driver from the vehicle. The bakkie was also recovered.</p>

      <p>"We frequently experience flash flooding in areas with water collecting capacity, such as Centurion and along the Apies River. Water collects quickly and also dissipates quickly," Mobasa said.</p>
      <p>Mobasa cautioned motorists against driving through heavy water flow during the rainy season.</p>
      <p>"If you are unsure of the depth of the water, rather take a detour and use an alternative route. While the water buildup may look small, moving water has a force that can often sweep away a vehicle."</p>
      <p>He added that Tshwane Metro Police are on standby during the rainy season for incidents of flooding.</p>
