      <p>Madeleine McCann's parent have thanked the public for 'being by our side' after being granted a £300,000 fund to continue their search.</p>
      <p>Kate and Gerry McCann shared the message on their <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> page writing: "Thank you for being by our side as we continue to search for Madeleine."</p>
      <p>The couple vowed to continue the worldwide hunt 'for as long as it takes'.</p>
      <p>The police probe, known as Operation Grange, has cost £12 million to date and received another £300,000 in July - 12 years after Madeleine disappeared.</p>

      <p>She vanished from an apartment in the Portuguese holiday resort of Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007.</p>
      <p>She was on holiday with her family at the time of her disappearance.</p>
      <p>Kate and Gerry left her sleeping with her other siblings while they had dinner at a nearby restaurant.</p>

      <p>Det Chief Inspector mark Cranwell has been put in charge of the investigation part-time, running a four-cop team to crack the case, according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/uknews/10261692/madeleine-mccanns-kate-gerry-thanks-public/?utm_campaign=sunmainfacebook&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook#Echobox=1572637571">The Sun</a>.</p>
      <p>In August, a forensic expert said he believes complex samples could hold the key to finding out what happened to Madeleine.</p>
      <p>Dr Perlin also said his Pittsburgh-based Cybernetics team - which identified victims of the 9/11 terror attack - is capable of cracking the case.</p>

      <p>The UK's Forensic Science Service has 18 samples from the investigation, which Dr Perlin wants released.</p>
      <p>Dr Perlin claims the evidence was “too complex” for the team and did not result in “meaningful inclusion/interpretation”.</p>
      <p>He told Daily Star Online: “Most of the apartment's samples were taken from the wall, floor, and skirting board. One item was from the curtains.</p>
      <p>“The mixture evidence could contain DNA from an unknown person who was not a member of the immediate McCann family.  </p>
      <p>“However, we wouldn't know whether or not that stranger was actually an ‘intruder’."</p>
