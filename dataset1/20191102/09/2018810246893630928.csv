World of Warcraft's Next Expansion Is Shadowlands
02 Nov 2019, 09:30 by Alex Walker



What's next for Azeroth? As it turns out, Sylvanas needs an army.
The undead leader and former Warchief of the Horde was the centrepiece of the major Blizzcon 2019 reveal, squaring off against the Lich King. Shadowlands, the new expansion, has dispensed with the Lich King for the first time in WoW's history.
In practical terms, that means the afterlife is now the new zone for players to explore in modern WoW. The realm is the home of the power for Death Knights and many of the spirits in the world of Azeroth. Players will choose a covenant, according to a gameplay reveal, and the expansion will release sometime in 2020.







More to come...
