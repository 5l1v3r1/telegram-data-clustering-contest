Lamb Weston靠薯仔變出百億市值 前景繼續看好
02 Nov 2019, 09:00 by 投資
薯仔在餐桌上通常只是大配角，不過薯條、薯蓉、焗薯皮、薯角、薯餅，以至簡單一個烚薯仔，在食客眼中不單只是主食，更是必需品。Lamb Weston（美股代號：LW）由上世紀50年代開始，便將薯仔食法玩到出神入化，成就出百億市值王國。

上世紀30年代初期，Lamb家族從事鮮果貿易及包裝生意，家族成員Gilbert Lamb在兄長支持下，進軍當時正冒起的急凍食品工業，於1950年在俄勒岡州韋斯頓成立了Lamb Weston。公司初期以急凍青豆起家，以先進加工技術獲市場好評，迅即成為美國急凍青豆市場的領導者。
眼見當地薯仔收成不俗，加上薯仔向來為主食，需求一定有保證，Gilbert Lamb便轉焦在急凍薯仔加工，1961開始製作急凍薯條。Gilbert Lamb研發出利用高速高壓水流將已烘乾旳薯仔切割成整齊條狀，並將技術註冊為Lamb Water Gun Knife（水槍刀）。
為麥當勞主要供應商
由過往勞工密集的工序，轉為全自動製作，成本大減的優勢下，Lamb Weston在薯仔加工工業快速上位。1971年，公司被夏威夷綜合企業Amfac, Inc.以發行新股方式收購，當時代價相當於4,300萬美元，之後十多年不斷透過併購壯大。公司於1987年再度易主，Amfac將夏威夷以外業務剝離，決定以2.76億美元將Lamb Weston出售予美國食品供應商Conagra Inc.（美股代號：CAG）和Golden Valley Microwave Foods Inc.的合營公司。
Lamb Weston在Conagra支持下，業務得以進一步國際化，規模愈做愈大。2016年，Conagra為更專注食品品牌業務發展，將Lamb Weston分拆獨立上市，每持有三股可獲分派一股Lamb Weston，藉此令股東價值得以體現。而Lamb Weston作為麥當勞（美股代號：MCD）、Yum! Brands（美股代號：YUM）旗下Taco Bell及肯德基的主要供應商，一掛牌即獲投資者追捧，一年之間累積升幅超過六成。時至今日，Lamb Weston為美國最大急凍薯製品商，在當地市佔率逾四成，全球則排行第二，僅次於McCain Foods。
日銷8,000萬份薯條
Lamb Weston目前在全球擁有26個生產基地，公司亦由最初傳統直條薯條，擴至圈圈薯、薯格、薯角、薯蓉等不同薯製品，銷售至逾100個國家及地區，每日全球銷量相當於8,000萬份薯條。
公司過去五個年度淨銷售年年遞增，2019年度淨銷售達37.57億美元，按年增加9.7%。剛於10月初公布2020年度首季業績，截至8月25日止第一季度淨銷售好過市場預期，達9.89億美元，按年增加8%，主要受環球部門增長帶動；毛利2.48億美元，上升7.8%。期內來自環球部門的淨銷售達5.17億美元，增幅10.8%；對經營溢利貢獻有1.02億美元，上升8.6%；至於食品服務部門的淨銷售3.05億美元，增長2.5%；經營溢利貢獻1.02億美元，微升0.4%。零售部門淨銷售上升11.2%，至1.29億美元；經營溢利貢獻大升27.3%，至2890萬美元。毛利及收入增加，令經營溢利上升11.4%，至1.7億美元。計及增持合資公司BSW所帶來的收益，調整後經營現金溢利增加9.3%，至2.32億美元。總計第一季度純利1.15億美元，增3.8%；每股攤薄盈利79美仙，上升8%，符合市場預期。
對於本年度展望，管理層相信，在銷量增加及較高產品價格組合帶動之下，淨銷售可錄得中單位數增幅。預測調整後經營現金溢利介乎9.5億至9.7億美元；而全年度資本開支則由2.75億上調至大約3億美元，主要用於升級企業資源計劃系統；全年度銷售及行政開支佔淨銷售比重，將介乎8%至8.5%。Lamb Weston公布季績後，刺激當日股價大升逾6%。美銀美林認為，在中小型市值企業當中，Lamb Weston絕對是首選。
估值較同業落後
該行指出，市場需求強勁，加上供應持續緊張的情況將持續至明年，按目前行業市況及管理層的發展策略，預計未來兩年度內部銷售增長最少可達4%，每股攤薄盈利增幅更加達8%。估值方面，較同業仍相對落後，故此維持給予「買入」評級，目標價85美元。事實上，作為主要競爭對手的McCain Foods近期動作多多，繼今年5月宣布投資3億美元，在華盛頓州奧賽羅興建薯仔加工廠房後；7月再下一城，計劃斥資1億美元在巴西興建新廠。預計兩個新生產基地均於2021年正式投產，屆時急凍薯條產能將顯著提升。



Lamb Weston亦因為對手積極搶攻，今年上半年走勢一直受壓，直至近兩季度業績繼續交足功課，兼且管理層作出正面展望，市場逐漸重拾信心。富瑞指出，市場早前關注同業產能增加令行業毛利受壓；然而，強勁的市場需求已將有關疑慮一掃而空。Lamb Weston前景可繼續看好，維持「買入」評級，同樣給予目標價85美元。免責聲明：本專頁刊載的所有投資分析技巧，只可作參考用途。市場瞬息萬變，讀者在作出投資決定前理應審慎，並主動掌握市場最新狀況。若不幸招致任何損失，概與本刊及相關作者無關。而本集團旗下網站或社交平台的網誌內容及觀點，僅屬筆者個人意見，與新傳媒立場無關。本集團旗下網站對因上述人士張貼之資訊內容所帶來之損失或損害概不負責。

Lamb Weston has changed its market value by billions of potatoes. The prospects continue to be optimistic.
02 Nov 2019, 09:00 by Investment
Potatoes are usually only a big supporting role on the table, but the French fries, yam, yam, potato wedges, hash browns, and even a simple potato simmer are not only staple foods, but also essential items in the eyes of diners. Lamb Weston (US stock code: LW) began in the 1950s, and the potato diet was played to the top of the world.

In the early 1930s, the Lamb family engaged in fresh fruit trade and packaging business. Family member Gilbert Lamb, with the support of his brother, entered the frozen food industry that was emerging at the time. In 1950, Lamb Weston was established in Weston, Oregon. At the beginning of the company, the company started from the frozen green beans and won the praise of the market with advanced processing technology. It quickly became the leader of the frozen green beans market in the United States.
Seeing the local potato harvest is good, and the potato is always the main food, the demand must be guaranteed, Gilbert Lamb turned to the frozen potato processing, and began to make frozen fries in 1961. Gilbert Lamb developed a high-speed, high-pressure water stream to cut dried potatoes into neat strips and registered the technology as Lamb Water Gun Knife.
Main supplier for McDonald's
Lamb Weston has quickly gained a position in the potato processing industry, from the labor-intensive process to the fully automatic production and the cost reduction. In 1971, the company was acquired by the Hawaiian conglomerate Amfac, Inc. in the form of new shares. At that time, the price was equivalent to $43 million, and it has continued to grow through mergers and acquisitions for more than a decade. The company re-emerged in 1987. Amfac divested its business outside of Hawaii and decided to sell Lamb Weston to a joint venture of US food supplier Conagra Inc. (US stock code: CAG) and Golden Valley Microwave Foods Inc. for $276 million.
With the support of Conagra, Lamb Weston has been further internationalized and scaled up. In 2016, Conagra focused on the development of the food brand business, splitting the independent listing of Lamb Weston, and each share of the three shares can be distributed to Lamb Weston, thereby reflecting the shareholder value. Lamb Weston, as a major supplier of McDonald's (US stock code: MCD), Yum! Brands (US stock code: YUM) Taco Bell and KFC, has been sought after by investors, with a cumulative increase of more than 60% in one year. Today, Lamb Weston is the largest frozen potato producer in the United States, with a market share of over 40% in the local market and second only to McCain Foods worldwide.
80 million servings of French fries
Lamb Weston currently has 26 production sites around the world. The company has also expanded from traditional straight French fries to different potato products such as potato, potato, potato wedges and potato stalks, which are sold to more than 100 countries and regions. The global sales volume is equivalent to 80 million French fries.
The company's net sales in the past five years have increased year by year. Net sales in 2019 reached US$3.757 billion, an increase of 9.7% year-on-year. Just announced the first quarter of 2020 in early October. As of August 25, the net sales in the first quarter were better than market expectations, reaching 989 million US dollars, up 8% year-on-year, mainly driven by global sector growth; gross profit of 248 million US dollars, rising 7.8%. During the period, net sales from the global division reached US$517 million, an increase of 10.8%; contribution to operating profit was US$102 million, up 8.6%; as for the food service sector, net sales were US$305 million, an increase of 2.5%; US$102 million, a slight increase of 0.4%. Net sales in the retail sector rose 11.2% to $129 million; operating profit contribution surged 27.3% to $28.9 million. Gross profit and higher revenues increased operating profit by 11.4% to US$170 million. Taking into account the increase in revenue from the joint venture company BSW, the adjusted operating cash profit increased by 9.3% to US$232 million. Total net profit for the first quarter was $115 million, an increase of 3.8%; diluted earnings per share was 79 US cents, up 8%, in line with market expectations.
For the current year's outlook, the management believes that net sales can record a median increase in volume driven by increased sales and higher product price combinations. The forecast adjusted operating cash profit ranges from $950 million to $970 million; while the annual capital expenditure is raised from $275 million to approximately $300 million, mainly for upgrading the enterprise resource planning system; annual sales and administrative expenses account for net sales The proportion will range from 8% to 8.5%. After Lamb Weston announced its quarterly results, the stock price surged more than 6% on the day. Bank of America Merrill Lynch believes that among small and medium-sized companies, Lamb Weston is definitely the first choice.
Valuation is behind the industry
The bank pointed out that strong market demand and continued tight supply will continue until next year. According to current industry conditions and management development strategy, internal sales growth is expected to be at least 4% in the next two years, and diluted earnings per share will increase even more. Up to 8%. In terms of valuation, it is still relatively backward compared with its peers. Therefore, it maintains a “Buy” rating with a target price of US$85. In fact, as a major competitor, McCain Foods has recently made a lot of moves, following the announcement of an investment of 300 million U.S. dollars in May this year, after the construction of a potato processing plant in Othello, Washington; in July, another city, plans to spend 100 million U.S. dollars in Brazil. Construction of a new factory. It is expected that the two new production bases will be officially put into operation in 2021, when the capacity of frozen fries will increase significantly.



Lamb Weston has also been under pressure since the opponents actively attacked. In the first half of this year, the trend has been under pressure until the performance of the past two quarters continues to deliver homework, and the management has made a positive outlook, and the market has gradually regained confidence. Furui pointed out that the market's earlier concern about the increase in inter-bank capacity has put pressure on the industry's gross profit; however, strong market demand has swept away doubts. Lamb Weston's prospects continue to be optimistic, maintaining a ""buy"" rating, also giving a target price of $85.
