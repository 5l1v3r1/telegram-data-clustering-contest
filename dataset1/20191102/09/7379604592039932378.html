In a bid to secure power he is ready to give Nicola Sturgeon free rein to “smash up the UK” and “throw the UK under the bus” by forming a coalition with the Scottish nationalists. Earlier this week Mr Corbyn said he would “not seek to block” another Scottish independence vote, although Labour emphasised it would not be an “early priority”. Mr Gove told the Mail: ” It clearly wasn't a gaffe – that was clearly the fluttering of their eyelashes at the SNP and now they are in bed together. And Corbyn and his team have made it perfectly clear they will offer the SNP a referendum.”</li>

He said: “If you vote for any other party the risk is you’ll just get Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour party, dither and delay, not just one referendum next year but two referendums.   “One on the EU, more the toxic, tedious torpor of another referendum on the EU, plus a referendum on breaking up the union between England and Scotland. “What a catastrophic menu for next year.” Mr Johnson’s comments come after Mr Farage issued him with an election ultimatum – drop your Brexit deal and form a pact or I’ll fight you in 500  seats. The Brexit Party leader gave the PM two weeks to join him or face a battle for Leave voters across the country. Brexit party chief Richard Tice vowed to deliver a “thundering majority” for the PM if they join forces. Ruling out a coalition, Boris defended his “fantastic” deal – boasting that “nobody thought we could get” it. He added: “It delivers everything that people wanted from the Brexit referendum, so taking back control of our money, borders, laws plus the whole of the UK coming out able to do proper free trade deal.” Mr Johnson faces a fight with the Brexit Party for the Leave vote in 90 key battleground seats that could be crucial in delivering Jeremy Corbyn the keys to No10. The seats are spread across the country from Sedgefield and Bury North to Birmingham Erdington and Ilford North. If Mr Farage stood down in the constituencies – 70 per cent of his supporters would go to the Tories. This would result in Mr Johnson beating Labour to 38 crucial seats. Boris would also win another 50 seats if all Brexit Party voters switched to back the PM in a national vote, analysis based on projections by Electoral Calculus suggests. The figures come as the Tories thrash Labour in the polls – storming ahead with a 17 point lead. Forty one per cent of Brits want Boris Johnson in Downing Street, while only 24 per cent are backing Mr Corbyn and 20 per cent want Lib Dem boss Jo Swinson as PM. It was also revealed yesterday that Jeremy Corbyn would sensationally snub Donald Trump if he becomes PM by refusing to visit the White House in his first year in office. Barry Gardiner dismissed the US President as being on the side of the “super rich” and said the Labour boss would focus on Europe if he reached No10. “We need to establish the future relationship that we have with Europe and therefore I would imagine that certainly in the first 12 months, our focus would be on the European Union. “We are not talking about Jeremy Corbyn wanting to go over to America.Ruling out a coalition, Boris defended his “fantastic” deal – boasting that “nobody thought we could get” it.
