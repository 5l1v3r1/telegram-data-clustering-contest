      <h1>Nawaz's platelet count drops again: personal physician</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T09:55:37+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 09:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/7761/news-2/" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>The personal physician of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif – Dr Adnan – has again raised alarm over the PML-N’s supremo’s deteriorating health and said the platelet count has dropped again to 38,000.</p>
      <p>The doctor added that the platelet count drop was witnessed after doctors tried to reduce administered steroid dose.</p>
      <p>“Former PM Nawaz Sharif remains critical,” Dr Khan tweeted. “The treating doctors tried to reduce the Steroids dose being given to him but unfortunately resulted in a drop in platelet count again which has come down to 38*10^3/uL yesterday.”</p>
      <p>He also added that severe existent co-morbidities (IHD, ECVD, DM, HTN, CKD3) has added to the seriousness of the nature of the critical illness.</p>

      <p>“A very delicate balance has to be maintained between coagulation &amp; anti-coagulation to sustain fragile unstable health status,” he stressed.</p>
      <p>The health of three-time prime minister showed improvement earlier on Friday as his platelet count reached 55,000.</p>
      <p>Nawaz has been admitted in Lahore’s Services Hospital for the past 12 days. He was diagnosed with acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and underwent a five-day Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy. The former prime minister also suffered an angina attack during his hospitalisation.</p>
      <p>However, the head of the government-constituted medical board, Dr Mahmood Ayaz, recommended against discharge.</p>

        <b>Acute Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura</b>
      </p>
      <p>More commonly referred to as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), it is a disorder that can lead to easy or excessive bruising and bleeding.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Mayo Clinic</i>, the bleeding results from unusually low levels of platelets — the cells that help blood clot. The symptoms include easy or excessive bruising, superficial bleeding into the skin that appears as pinpoint-sized reddish-purple spots (petechiae) that look like a rash – usually on the lower legs, bleeding from the gums or nose.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to <i>Harvard Medical School</i>, intravenous immunoglobulin is primarily used to treat other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions.</p>
      <p>Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) contains the pooled immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunoglobulins from the plasma of approximately a thousand or more blood donors, according to E-<i>medicine</i>.</p>
