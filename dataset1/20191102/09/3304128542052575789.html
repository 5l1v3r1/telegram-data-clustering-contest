      <h1>Ezekiel Mutua Wants Ethic’s Tarimbo Hit Taken Down By Google For Advocating For Violence Against Women</h1>

      <p>Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) CEO Ezekiel Mutua wants Ethic Entertainment’s new song, Tarimbo taken down by Google.</p>
      <p>In a lengthy Facebook rant, the moral policeman said the song advocates for violence against women.</p>
      <p>He further called for the arrest of the group “for going beyond the prescribed delimitations on freedom of expression by advocating for violence against women.”</p>
      <p>Mutua who earlier in the year banned the group’s Wamlambez hit from being played anywhere apart from clubs, dismissed them as an excuse for artistes.</p>
      <p>“These so-called musicians and performers have defied everything decent societies holds dear. They have thrown morality to the four winds in the name of money and popularity,” he continued.</p>
      <p>“My interpretation of <i>Wamlambez </i>and<i> Tarimbo</i> is that these are not artists. They are demented circus thugs hiding behind the art to promote indecency. Any self-respecting DJ should not play these songs. No club should allow music that advocates for violence against women,” he lamented.</p>
      <p>This time around, the KFCB boss said, a line has to be drawn clearly indicating what is decent and what’s not.</p>
      <p>“Unless decent people rise against the wave of immorality in Kenya, we are going to lose a generation in the name of creative freedom. No freedom is absolute. This time round we must draw the line!”</p>
      <p>On Twitter however, Kenyans criticized Mutua for asking Google to take down the youngsters’ song.</p>
      <p>Some wondered why Mutua, an elderly man could not have a sit down meeting with Ethic instead of taking matters into his own hands.</p>
