      <p>Netizens are LOLing at a fan account of <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/seventeen">Seventeen</a>. This Twitter account named "Best dancing Kpop Groups" seems like a regular rating/ranking account, but it was closed after just posting Seventeen's video. </p>
      <p>Netizens are loving this witty account. Some of the comments include: <i>"Honestly, this is a whole mood.",</i><i>"I love how he/she created an account just to say that Seventeen is the best K-pop group at dancing", "Carats are so creative at idolizing their group"</i></p>
      <p>What are your thoughts? </p>
