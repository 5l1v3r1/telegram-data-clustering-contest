      <p>Dermot O'Leary was left stuttering live on X Factor tonight as he forgot the Love Islanders' names in an awkward moment.</p>
      <p>The presenter was left stumbling after momentarily struggling to remember who <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-josh-denzel-love-islands-12673866">Josh Denzel</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-laura-anderson-saucy-cabin-12610982">Laura Anderson</a> were.</p>
      <p>Josh and Laura were supporting fellow Islanders Eyal Booker, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-wes-nelson-everything-you-12611484">Wes Nelson</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-samira-mighty-love-island-12611246">Samira Mighty</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-love-islands-zara-mcdermott-12724738">Zara McDermott</a> in the audience when Dermot came over to speak to them.</p>
      <p>Welcoming viewers back from the ad break, Dermot began by saying: "I've managed to get a prime spot in the audience (I know the maitre'd!) right here with..."</p>

      <p>Sitting down, he looked at Josh and Laura and appeared to struggle to remember their names.</p>
      <p>However the names soon clicked and he said: "...Josh and Laura."</p>
      <p>It was a night of awkwardness after Martin Bashir was left in tears as he tried to stop his performance twice.</p>

      <p>The presenter, 56, looked lost on the stage as he forgot the lyrics to Lionel Richie's Easy.</p>
      <p>However the judges didn't go easy on him, with Louis Walsh comparing him to a "drunken uncle at a wedding".</p>
      <p>Judge Nicole Scherzinger hit back, saying that it was an "honour" to have him on the show.</p>

      <p>In the middle of his performance, he shocked viewers and judges by announcing: "I've forgotten my words."</p>
      <p>He tried to carry on but later added: "I do apologise."</p>
      <p>Backstage, fellow star Victoria held her hands to her chest while Jenny looked on in horror.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> asked what had happened.</p>

      <p>Martin claimed that a last minute song change was to blame for his lapse in memory.</p>
      <p>"I'm not trying to make excuses but my song had to change," he said. "I've been anxious all evening and it went out of my mind."</p>
