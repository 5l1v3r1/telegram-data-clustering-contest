「沙卡里巴」是臺南康樂市場一帶的小吃集散地，音譯自日文「盛り場」，意思是熱鬧的地方，此地曾是知名觀光景點，卻幾經失火而沒落。目前仍有招牌老店屹立不搖，讓古早味繼續飄香，其中一間便是「基明飯桌仔」。



數十樣魚料理、肉食、食蔬盡展眼前，慢一步就被搶光。

隱藏版店家　限量牛肉湯
因地緣之便，遊客們來臺南嘗一碗新鮮牛肉湯早已眾人皆知；但「尚好吃牛肉湯」算是眾多饕家朋友小道消息中，最常被提及的隱藏版店家。隨著推薦人入座，點餐後，只見老闆開始動刀，將一片片鮮紅的溫體牛肉，置入湯中，在碗內攪散。湯才上桌，聞到立刻嘴饞起來，捧著碗，喝一口湯，牛骨熬煮的湯鮮裡帶甜、奶香濃厚，牛肉送入口中，嫩香柔滑、入口即化，從氣味、湯頭到口感，皆是上等。

樹下的傳說　菜粽秒完售
寧靜的清晨，「沙淘宮」前的小小菜粽攤位，不出意外地大排長龍。正如諺語所說「早起的鳥兒有蟲吃」，推薦人則改為「早起的人才有菜粽吃」，特別吩咐不得遲到，因為臺南人非常重視早餐，有些熱門的早餐店，例如「老鄭的粽子」因為開店時間早，又盛名在外，總是迅速完售，因此成了傳說中的美食。


鬆軟的菜粽配上熱呼呼的味增湯，暖心也暖胃。

老鄭的粽子已在沙淘宮前擺攤近70年。如果只說「老鄭」，未必所有人都知道，但說起沙淘宮的菜粽，一定無人不曉。也因為太有名氣，吸引眾多觀光客慕名而來，更是加快完售速度，有饕客封其為「臺南最難買的菜粽」。


因為早賣、限量，有饕客封其為「臺南最難買的菜粽」。

入座後，點餐，只見老闆動作熟練，才將粽葉尖端輕輕拉下，現場就聞到濃濃的月桃葉香，老闆迅速淋上油膏、香菜末，便送上桌來，較之「得來速」不遑多讓。


「老鄭的粽子」已在沙淘宮前擺攤近70年。

咬一口，月桃葉的香味剛從舌尖綻放，牙齒就被鬆彈心軟的糯米黏住了。仔細一看，菜粽的糯米米形完整，花生顆粒飽滿，在口中咀嚼，滿滿的飽足感。店家未加花生粉，只為保持菜粽的原味，淋上店家獨家調製的辣油膏，上口甘甜，是老臺南人喜歡的滋味，不膩不稠，帶點甘味，一吃上癮、欲罷不能，與菜粽堪稱絕配，連吃2個菜粽，滿口全是米香、月桃香。吃完菜粽，再喝上一碗暖呼呼的味增湯，湯裡是新鮮的油條，店家還貼心地附上可解油膩的決明子茶，大樹下的古早味速食樸素淡雅，別有一番風味。
