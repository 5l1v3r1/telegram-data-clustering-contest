【本週音樂】專輯同名主打〈七天〉　陳昇唱出對歲月的告白
02 Nov 2019, 23:04 by 陳于嬙
陳昇回歸本我，推出新專輯《七天》，或許是描寫一座虛擬小鎮，又或許是陳昇盡其一生所遇到的人事物、見過的風景，全都納入其中，他說：「我想用這張專輯，回到最簡單的狀態，不管世界要怎樣。」
《七天》的起源，是創作一張單純、樸素的專輯，最初製作設計是從一張吉他獨奏專輯出發，後來才慢慢演變成現在的版本。為了錄製專輯，陳昇帶著音樂人范君豪、李禮勇及錄音師徐玉光，以四人小組的編制組合，到花蓮小鎮，實地取材錄音，在7天內完成專輯音樂雛形。
熟稔製作及創作30年的陳昇，將音樂回歸原形，吉他獨奏為主要旋律線條，加上娓娓道來的歌聲口氣，曲子間綴放的蟬鳴流水聲、火車行進聲，趨近人生況味的簡單樂章，如微風輕柔，亦如腳踏泥土的扎根厚重，陳昇說：「做音樂這麼久了，還可以跟這些簡單的人，做出簡單的音樂，我很愉快。」
同名主打歌〈七天〉，是陳昇對歲月的告白，充滿詩意的描述7天能短快，也能久得看不見盡頭，端看要怎麼活，陳昇點出，珍惜過好每一天，經歷洗鍊的感受，追尋真理的自由。
〈樹搬家〉歌詞隱含全球暖化現象，以及將鳥兒擬人化，偏鄉人口持續外流，再往更深一層看去，自然生態與人類之間失去平衡也失去了尊重，藉此喚醒對萬物的敬意與疼惜。〈一直以來〉以悠悠的吉他聲，伴隨著蟲聲伴鳴，陳昇將自己的聲音放在明亮聲線的後方，是一種守候，一種近乎樸素的存在。
關於《七天》，陳昇說：「專輯啟發於一棵樹，再而是活七天的小黑蚊、過馬路的小草蛇、沉默的螢火蟲、飄移的雲，狗兒、花草午後的小村，逃去城市的山地公主，以及想念姐姐的弟弟。」他期許每個人都能在這張專輯遇到自己，看見自身影子投放出來的角色與人生觀。

[This week's music] album with the same name (seven days) Chen Sheng sings the confession of the years
02 Nov 2019, 23:04 by Chen Yuxi
Chen Sheng returned to me and launched the new album ""Seven Days"", perhaps describing a virtual town, or perhaps the scenes that Chen Sheng had encountered in his life and the scenery he had seen. All of them were included. He said: ""I want to use This album, back to the simplest state, no matter what the world wants.""
The origin of ""Seven Days"" is to create a simple, simple album. The original design was started from a guitar solo album, and later evolved into the current version. In order to record the album, Chen Sheng took the musicians Fan Junhao, Li Liyong and the recording engineer Xu Yuguang to form a combination of four people to the Hualien town, to take the recordings in the field and complete the album music prototype in 7 days.
Chen Sheng, who is familiar with the production and creation for 30 years, returns the music to its original shape. The guitar solo is the main melody line, plus the melody of the singer, the singer of the songs, the sound of the train, and the trend of life. Simple movements, such as gentle breeze, are also like the thick roots of the pedals. Chen Sheng said: ""It’s been a long time since I played music. I can make simple music with these simple people. I am very happy.""
The title song of the same name (seven days) is Chen Sheng’s confession of the years. The poetic description is short and fast in 7 days. It can also be seen for a long time. Seeing how to live, Chen Sheng points out, cherishes every day, and goes through the chain washing. Feeling, pursuing the freedom of truth.
The lyrics of ""Tree Moving"" implied the phenomenon of global warming, and the anthropomorphization of birds, the continued outflow of the local population, and then a deeper look, the loss of balance between natural ecology and humanity also lost respect, thereby awakening all things Respect and pity. ""Always"" with a long guitar sound, accompanied by insects, Chen Sheng placed his voice behind the bright sound line, is a kind of waiting, a near-simple existence.
Regarding ""Seven Days"", Chen Sheng said: ""The album is inspired by a tree, but a small black mosquito that lived for seven days, a grass snake that crosses the road, a silent firefly, a drifting cloud, a dog, a small village in the afternoon, and fled. Go to the mountain princess in the city, and miss my older brother."" He expects everyone to meet themselves on this album and see their role and outlook on life.
