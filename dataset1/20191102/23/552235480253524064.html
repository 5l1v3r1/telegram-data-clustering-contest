      <h1>The Stephen Robinson compensation fee Hearts must pay to get Motherwell boss revealed</h1>
      <h2>The Fir Park gaffer is Ann Budge's top choice but she'll have to cough up a big fee to get him.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T23:30:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 23:30</time> by <a rel="author">Scott McDermott, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-mcdermott/</a></address>
      <p>Hearts will have to pay Motherwell £120,000 to snare top managerial target <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stephen-robinson">Stephen Robinson.</a></p>
      <p><i><b>MailSport</b> </i>understands the Fir Park boss is Ann Budge’s first choice to replace <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Craig Levein.</a></p>
      <p>But she’ll have to cough up a six-figure sum for the 44-year-old, whose Well contact runs to 2022.</p>
      <p>Budge held a board meeting on Friday and was backed by the Tynecastle hierarchy in putting Robinson at the top of their wanted list.</p>
      <p>She will sift through a number of applications for the job but the Northern Irishman is the leading candidate.</p>
      <p>He has Well sitting third in the Premiership and has done a terrific job with limited resources. Levein’s assistant Austin MacPhee will take charge of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> for today’s Betfred Cup semi-final against Rangers at Hampden.</p>

      <p>He’s in the mix to get the job permanently, as is club legend John Robertson, who is in charge at Inverness.</p>
      <p>Jack Ross is also in contention, although we understand no contact has been made with the former St Mirren and Sunderland gaffer.</p>
      <p>And bookies Sky Bet slashed odds on Manchester United legend <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane">Roy Keane</a> taking over.</p>
      <p>But Robinson – who has worked alongside MacPhee in the Northern Ireland coaching set-up – is the frontrunner.</p>
      <p>Well are braced for an approach for their gaffer but will fight to keep him by demanding about £120,000 in compensation.</p>
      <p>Robinson’s side beat Livingston 2-1 yesterday and he said afterwards: “I don’t need to deal with the speculation.</p>
      <p>“I am just delighted we are third in the league. I’m going to enjoy my Saturday night.”</p>
