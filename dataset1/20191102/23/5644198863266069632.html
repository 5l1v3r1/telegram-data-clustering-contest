      <p>PARIS: Novak Djokovic reached the Paris Masters final for the sixth time when he downed Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov 7-6(5) 6-4 with an impressive performance on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The world number one, who will be supplanted by Rafael Nadal at top of the ATP rankings on Monday, prevailed in a high-octane first-set tiebreak before wearing Dimitrov down in the second.</p>

      <p>The Serb will face either 19-time Grand Slam champion Nadal or Canada's Denis Shapovalov in Sunday's showpiece at Bercy.</p>
      <p>Top seed Djokovic, who has lifted the trophy here four times and will play in his 50th Masters final, played better in the key moments and served well throughout.</p>
      <p>There were no break points in the first set.</p>
      <p>In the tiebreak, Dimitrov moved 5-3 up after an untimely Djokovic double fault, only for the Serb to regain his composure, levelling for 5-5 with an exquisite defensive lob and winning the set at the end of a lung-busting 35-shot rally.</p>
      <p>Dimitrov let his guard down in the fifth game of the second set, allowing Djokovic to snatch the only break of the match.</p>
      <p>The 16-time Grand Slam winner held serve throughout to strengthen his hopes of ending the season as world number one.</p>
      <p>As a result of Djokovic's victory, second-seeded Spaniard Nadal must win the title to secure the year-end number one spot.</p>
