【全文】長榮兄弟爆新爭議　張榮發慈善基金會董座鬧雙包
02 Nov 2019, 23:28 by 劉志原, 楊彩成, 陳毅偉, 董孟航
長榮集團經營權戰火不斷，本刊日前才披露張榮發基金會（下稱文教基金會）董事改選，驚傳黑槍恐嚇、黑道威脅事件，如今又爆出張榮發慈善基金會董事長鬧雙包案，老三張國政發函主管機關衛福部，要求介入召開董事會改選解決爭議，希望在擁有慈善基金會席次的優勢下，拿下董事長寶座。
本刊調查，慈善基金會掌控長榮國際5％股權，雖然沒有文教基金會28％來得多，但在長榮航空及海運等事業體都派有法人董事，若取得董事長就有左右決策的權力，等於是鬆動長榮集團經營權的破口，但長榮高層不解的是，張國政竟更進一步想讓妻子曾瓊慧娘家控制、疑有財務問題的盲人重建院勢力進入文教基金會。



長榮集團經營權戰火持續延燒，目前擔任張榮發慈善基金會董事長的鍾德美，秉持集團「專業經理人治理」的理念行使職權，以大股東的身分同意選任柯麗卿等人管理長榮集團，但張榮發三子張國政對人選不認同，已自行召開董事會推選長汎旅行社前董座吳景明出任董事長，形成慈善基金會董座鬧雙包。


長汎旅行社前董事長吳景明獲張國政支持，獲選為張榮發慈善基金會董座，鬧出董座雙包。

　
發函衛福部　盼介入改選
10月5日張國政再發函衛福部，要求「衛福部下令給張榮發慈善基金會，應在10日內舉行董事會」，準備撤換鍾德美，但衛福部基於法人自治原則，避免偏袒及圖利任一方，並未直接下指導棋，僅發函要求張榮發慈善基金會針對會務應依法處理。

張國政發文給衛福部，要拉下張榮發慈善基金會董事長鍾德美。


長榮集團創辦人張榮發生前以公益捐贈方式，創立張榮發（文教）基金會及張榮發慈善基金會，精心設計由二大基金會掌控長榮集團，透過基金會投資長榮國際公司，分別持有長榮國際28.8％及5％股權，牢牢握住旗下航空、海運等各個事業體的經營權，也就是說誰控制這二大基金會，就等於控有整個長榮集團的4000億元資產。這也是為何「文教」基金會的董事改選會傳出黑道介入，如今張國政又急於要改選「慈善」基金會。

改選贏面大　人事恐洗牌
據本刊調查，張榮發慈善基金會雖僅握有長榮國際5％的股權，但是知情人士透露，張榮發慈善基金會的15席董事中，老三張國政控有9票過半的優勢，一旦改選，極有可能拔掉現任董事長鍾德美，選出的新任董事長將可撤換基金會派駐在集團轄下長榮航空、長榮海運、長榮國際儲運等公司的各2席董事。

該人士表示，張國政的目標顯然不只有慈善基金會，他與老二張國明聯手想奪回的下一個堡壘，為長榮集團最重要的大股東張榮發（文教）基金會，2人有意引進老三張國政妻子曾瓊慧娘家勢力控制的新莊盲人重建院進駐。目前長榮集團由專業經理人治理的制度，可能隨老三張國政的步步近逼而有所鬆動。

知情人士透露，從事慈善業的盲人重建院，曾由前總統李登輝妻子曾文惠胞弟曾文雄擔任董事長。曾文雄過世後，目前由老三張國政的小舅子曾瀚霖擔任董事長，2016年曾瀚霖擔任執行長期間，盲人重建院傳出財務報表上列出虧損1億元，後來更以院產土地向元大銀行設定抵押26億元，近來可能面臨不小的財務壓力，卻被安排進入市值4000億元的長榮集團，長榮內部已對此議論紛紛。

本刊調查，新莊盲人重建院位於新北市新莊區，占地逾3,000坪，土地開發價值逾40億元，張國政從事建築業的岳母曾黃麗明，目前是李登輝基金會董事，她2003年進入重建院董事會，因為信奉佛教，後來即傳出曾黃麗明有意將盲人重建院的院產捐給慈濟，驚動長老教會，爆發長老教會與慈濟爭奪40億元院產風波，十多年前一度在媒體上鬧得沸沸揚揚。


盲人重建院位於新北市新莊，近來傳出虧損1億元並向銀行設定抵押26億元。

風波平息後，曾黃麗明的丈夫曾梁源及兒子曾瀚霖也都曾擔任重建院董事，近水樓台下，曾家的瀚成建設在2013年與盲人重建院簽定承包重大地上權開發合約，重建院提供千坪土地交由曾家的建設公司蓋大樓，並設定70年地上權給曾家的建設公司進行開發，卻傳出掏空重建院疑慮，後來改建因故破局，2016年雙方交付仲裁，盲人重建院財報隨即出現一億元虧損。
知情人士說，消息曝光後，負責該財報簽證的會計師突然換人，重建院在2017年完成新大樓工程後，將院產土地向元大銀行設定26億餘元的最高限額抵押，引發主管機關注意，張國政卻在此時有意引進重建院現任董事許嘉旭及林葉阿美，擔任張榮發（文教）基金會董事，不免讓人聯想到以往曾家進入盲人重建院時發生過的爭議。
　
兄弟搶權位　黑道也覬覦
本刊調查，長榮兄弟爭奪經營權的戰火，關鍵起因於是否遵照張榮發「專業經理人治理公司」的遺願。長榮集團創辦人張榮發2016年過世後，留下市值四千億元的集團資產，大房三個兒子分裂成兩派，老二張國明與老三張國政聯手以股權大於老大張國華為由，對目前長榮集團由專業經理人治理不以為然，雙方過招多次，連黑白二道勢力都介入，也有立委頻頻關切。

去年12月，張榮發（文教）基金會召開董事會前，接連發生黑槍、暴力及黑道幫派恐嚇事件，不僅長榮國際董事長柯麗卿被製造假車禍亮黑槍、長榮國際總經理戴錦銓遭跟蹤，今年初張榮發（文教）基金會董事長鍾德美更接到恐嚇電話，要求她立即辭職，否則住家會被放火，一連串的人身安全威脅，搞得長榮經營層人心惶惶，檢警偵辦後發現，恐嚇事件是北部某幫派分子所為。
本刊10月2日披露老三張國政的連襟謝國獻，被檢警認為與黑道介入爭奪長榮集團經營權有關，七月間已被列為「組織犯罪」被告拘提到案，全案擴大偵辦中，此外，謝國獻另涉恐嚇討債案遭判拘役30日，由於謝國獻目前是長榮國際監察人，消息一曝光，各界無不議論紛紛，沒多久張國政就另外再出招，發函衛福部要求解決慈善基金會問題。

張國政連襟謝國獻去年12月想闖入張榮發（文教）基金會董事會場，遭保全勸阻。（讀者提供）


知情人士指出，張榮發（文教）基金會與張榮發慈善基金會各設十五席董事，基金會自1985年成立到張榮發過世，30年來均由董事依章程獨立運作，不會干涉長榮集團各公司經營。
　
欲取得主導　拒外人管理
長榮集團轄下各公司依張榮發生前安排，委由專業經理人經營，不再是「家天下」的傳統家族企業，家族成員扮演好大股東角色，以達到張榮發讓長榮集團走向「百年企業，永續經營」的擘劃，專業經理人則由合法股東會投票產生。張榮發過世3年以來，集團各公司運作順暢。


長榮集團目前由專業經理人治理，傳出將有盲人重建院的外部勢力介入。

然而，大房二子以及三子於張榮發過世不久，就有意變更父親生前意旨，認為2個基金會共30席董事，應改由三兄弟平均分配，老三張國政認為，長榮集團是父親張榮發帶著子女打拚得來，不應由外人主導管理，與妻子曾瓊慧娘家勢力跟連襟謝國獻，聯合二哥張國明想要主導長榮國際，欲取得張榮發2個基金會的主導權。
2大基金會的董事會各15席董事，大都由長榮集團員工或張榮發的兒子們擔任，目前張榮發（文教）基金會因二房獨子張國煒退出，形成大房老大與老三各7票對7票的平手局面。



目前張榮發（文教）基金會及慈善基金會的董事長都是鍾德美（右）。



長榮國際董事長柯麗卿（中）是集團老臣，也是專業經理人。


至於董座鬧雙包的張榮發慈善基金會，老大僅有6票，將來若改選董座，老三張國政聯手老二張國明控有9票的絕對優勢，將有機會以此為破口，改變目前由老大張國華支持專業經理人治理的布局。
大房兄弟間的歧見，自去年12月11日擴大爭端至今仍餘波盪漾，當天張榮發（文教）基金會改選，不僅發生連串暴力及恐嚇事件，接著陸續興訟，老三張國政提出7大官司，其中已敗訴3件，後來基金會的主管機關教育部及衛福部也介入要求改善，其間還有立委及一名有「藍營國師」之稱的諸羅山人方寬銘，也都傳出居中熱心奔走。

長榮前顧問　宣稱將變天
知情人士指出，諸羅山人曾是長榮集團顧問，但目前在長榮集團已無任何職稱與辦公室，集團內部卻仍有不少人收到他的訊息，指稱長榮集團即將變天，由於諸羅山人上次總統大選時曾準確預測國民黨會換柱，但預測其他選情卻多次落空，如今他對長榮的預測，雖在長榮內部引起討論，但已無足輕重。


張榮發二房兒子張國煒（左）自創星宇航空，淡出長榮集團，圖為張國煒10月28日親自開回星宇航空新機。

長榮爭權戰火近一年來除了黑道、訴訟、主管機關介入的三部曲，政界及宗教界人士也爭相關切，遭列「組織犯罪」被告拘提的老三連襟謝國獻，一再強調黑道與恐嚇事件與他無關，向來低調的老二張國明則首度打破沉默，反控基金會董事長鍾德美失職。


長榮集團剛度過空服員罷工風暴，卻因經營權之爭而再度鬧上新聞版面。

張榮發大房3個兒子對於經營權之戰打得火熱，各有堅持，長榮內鬨表面上看來是兄弟鬩牆，如今卻傳出黑道介入及老三妻子娘家介入奪權，該如何解決張榮發慈善基金會董事長雙包爭議，並化解僵局，以避免市值4000億元的長榮集團陷入動盪，正考驗著張家兄弟與主管機關的智慧。

[Full Text] Evergreen Brothers Disputes New Disputes Zhang Rongfa Charity Foundation Dongshuang Double Pack
02 Nov 2019, 23:28 by Liu Zhiyuan, Yang Caicheng, Chen Yiwei, Dong Menghang
The management of Evergreen Group has been raging. The publication of the Zhang Rongfa Foundation (hereinafter referred to as the Culture and Education Foundation) was re-elected, and the black gun threatening and the underworld threats were shocked. Now, the chairman of the Zhang Rongfa Charity Foundation has been smashed. The old three Zhang Guozheng sent a letter to the Ministry of Health and Welfare Department, requesting to intervene in the re-election of the board of directors to resolve the dispute, hoping to win the chairman's throne under the advantage of having a charitable foundation.
According to the survey, the charitable foundation controls the 5% stake in Evergreen International. Although there is no 28% of the cultural and educational foundations, there are legal directors in EVA Air and shipping companies. If you get the chairman, you have the power to make decisions. It is equal to loosening the management of the Evergreen Group's management rights, but Changrong's top management is puzzled by the fact that Zhang Guozheng is even more eager to let the wife of Zeng Qionghui's family control and suspected financial problems rebuild the hospital into the cultural and educational foundation.



Evergreen Group's management rights continued to burn. Zhong Demei, who is currently the chairman of Zhang Rongfa Charitable Foundation, upholds the group's ""professional manager governance"" concept and exercises his powers as the majority shareholder. He is elected as the chief shareholder of Ke Liqing and others to manage the Evergreen Group, but Zhang Rongfa's three sons Zhang Guozheng did not agree with the candidate. He has convened the board of directors to elect the former director of the Changpan Travel Agency, Wu Jingming, to serve as the chairman of the board, forming a double-package for the charity foundation.


Wu Jingming, former chairman of Changpan Travel Agency, was supported by Zhang Guozheng and was elected as the director of Zhang Rongfa Charity Foundation.


Send a letter to the Department of Health and Welfare
On October 5, Zhang Guozheng sent a letter to the Department of Health and Welfare, requesting that the ""Weifu Department ordered the Zhang Rongfa Charitable Foundation to hold a board of directors within 10 days"" to prepare for the removal of Zhong Demei, but the Weifu Department was based on the principle of legal autonomy to avoid partiality and profit. I did not directly direct the game. I only sent a letter requesting the Zhang Rongfa Charity Foundation to deal with the conference according to law.

Zhang Guozheng sent a letter to the Department of Health and Welfare to pull down the chairman of Zhang Rongfa Charity Foundation, Zhong Demei.


Zhang Rong, the founder of Evergreen Group, founded the Zhang Rongfa (Cultural and Cultural) Foundation and the Zhang Rongfa Charity Foundation in the form of charitable donations. He carefully designed the Evergreen Group to be controlled by the two foundations and invested in Evergreen International through the Foundation. With 28.8% and 5% equity, we firmly hold the management rights of various aviation and shipping businesses, which means that controlling the two foundations is equivalent to controlling the entire Evergreen Group's 400 billion yuan assets. This is also why the ""Cultural and Cultural"" Foundation's directors' reelection will send out gangster interventions. Now Zhang Guozheng is eager to re-elect the ""Charity"" Foundation.



Zhang Rongfa's eldest son, Zhang Guohua (pictured), insisted on maintaining the management of his father's professional managers.



Zhang Rongzhen, the founder of Evergreen Group, Zhang Guozheng (pictured), recently made a move to regain the group's management rights.



Re-election wins big people
According to the survey, although the Zhang Rongfa Charitable Foundation only holds a 5% stake in Evergreen International, but informed sources revealed that among the 15 directors of the Zhang Rongfa Charity Foundation, the old three Zhang Guozheng has an advantage of 9 votes and more than half, once re-elected, It is highly probable that the current chairman, Zhong Demei, will be removed. The newly elected chairman will be able to remove the two directors of the company, including EVA Air, Evergreen Marine, Evergreen International Storage and Transportation.


Zhang Rongming, the second son of Zhang Rongfa, rarely made public appearances. This year, it rarely appeared in the group’s New Year group. (provided by the reader)

The person said that Zhang Guozheng’s goal is obviously not only the charitable foundation, but the next bastion that he and the second son Zhang Guoming want to recapture, is the most important major shareholder of the Evergreen Group, Zhang Rongfa (Cultural and Cultural) Foundation, and two people intend to introduce the old three. The Xinzhuang Blind Reconstruction Institute, controlled by the national political wife Zeng Qiong Hui’s family, was stationed. At present, the system governed by professional managers of Evergreen Group may be loosened with the recent efforts of the three national governments.


Zhang Guozheng (pictured) and his wife, Zeng Qionghui's family, combined with the blind rebuilding of the Zeng family, and intervened in the dispute over the management of Evergreen.

According to informed sources, the blind reconstruction of the charity industry was once chaired by former President Lee Teng-hui’s wife, Zeng Wenhui’s brother Zeng Wenxiong. After Zeng Wenxiong passed away, Zeng Yulin, the youngest son of the old three government officials, is the chairman of the board. In 2016, when Zeng Yulin was the chief executive officer, the blind rebuilding institute issued a financial statement with a loss of 100 million yuan. Later, the farmland land was extended to Yuanda. The bank has set a mortgage of 2.6 billion yuan. Recently, it may face considerable financial pressure, but it has been arranged to enter the Evergreen Group with a market value of 400 billion yuan. Evergreen has already discussed this issue.

According to our survey, the Xinzhuang Blind Reconstruction Institute is located in Xinzhuang District, Xinbei City, covering an area of more than 3,000 pings. The land development value is more than 4 billion yuan. Zhang Guozheng’s mother-in-law, Huang Liming, who is engaged in the construction industry, is currently a director of the Lee Teng-hui Foundation. In the year of entering the Board of Reconstruction, because of Buddhism, it was later revealed that Zeng Huang Liming intended to donate the hospital of the blind reconstruction to Tzu Chi, alarming the Presbyterian Church, and erupting the Presbyterian Church and Tzu Chi to compete for the 4 billion yuan of hospitality, more than ten I was so angry in the media one year ago.


The Blind Reconstruction Institute is located in Xinzhuang, New Taipei City. It has recently reported a loss of 100 million yuan and set a mortgage of 2.6 billion yuan to the bank.

After the storm subsided, Zeng Huang Liming’s husband, Zeng Liangyuan and his son, Zeng Yulin, also served as directors of the Reconstruction Institute. Under the water platform, Zeng’s construction of Zeng’s construction contracted a major land development contract with the Blind Reconstruction Institute in 2013. Providing Qianping land to the building of the construction company of Zengjia, and setting up 70 years of land rights to the construction company of Zengjia for development, but the doubts about the reconstruction of the hollow space, and later the reconstruction of the cause, the two parties submitted the arbitration in 2016, The blind rebuilding of the hospital’s financial report immediately showed a loss of 100 million yuan.
Informed sources said that after the news was exposed, the accountant responsible for the financial report visa suddenly changed. After the completion of the new building project in 2017, the rebuilt hospital set the maximum amount of 2.6 billion yuan to the Yuanda Bank, causing the competent authority. Attention, Zhang Guozheng intends to introduce Xu Jiaxu and Lin Ye Amei, the current directors of the Reconstruction Institute, as directors of the Zhang Rongfa (Cultural and Cultural) Foundation. It is reminiscent of the disputes that have occurred in the past when they entered the blind rebuilding.

Brothers grab the power
According to the survey, the key to the war of the Evergreen brothers in competing for management rights is whether they follow the wishes of Zhang Rongfa's ""Professional Managers Governance Company"". After the death of Zhang Rongfa, the founder of Evergreen Group in 2016, he left the group assets of 400 billion yuan, and the three sons of Dafang split into two factions. The second son Zhang Ming and the old three Zhang Guozheng jointly took the equity more than the boss Zhang Guohua. At present, the Evergreen Group is not convinced by the management of professional managers. The two sides have repeatedly resorted to many times, and even the black and white forces have intervened, and there are frequent concerns of the legislators.

In December last year, before the Zhang Rongfa (Cultural and Cultural) Foundation held the board of directors, black guns, violence and innocent gang gangs were intimidated. Not only was Evergreen International Chairman Ke Liqing being made a fake car accident, the black gun and Changrong International General Manager Dai Jinxi were tracked. At the beginning of this year, Zhang Rongfa ( Wen De) Chairman of the Foundation, Zhong Demei, received a threatening phone call and asked her to resign immediately. Otherwise, the family will be set on fire. A series of personal security threats will make the Evergreen management team feel worried. After the investigation, the intimidation incident is a gang in the north. What the molecules do.
On October 2nd, the magazine disclosed that the third of the three state administrations, Lian Guoxian, was considered by the prosecutor to be involved in the dispute over the management of the Evergreen Group. In July, the defendant was listed as an ""organized crime"" and the case was expanded. In addition, Xie Guoxian was convicted of another 30-day criminal detention case. Since Xie Guoxian is currently a supervisor of Evergreen International, the news has been exposed, and all circles have been talking about it. It is not long before Zhang Guozheng has another move, sending a letter to the Ministry of Health and Welfare to solve the problem. Charity Foundation issues.

Informed sources pointed out that Zhang Rongfa (Cultural and Cultural) Foundation and Zhang Rongfa Charitable Foundation each set up 15 directors. The Foundation was established in 1985 and passed away to Zhang Rongfa. For 30 years, the directors have operated independently according to the regulations and will not interfere with the operations of the Evergreen Group companies. .

Want to gain leadership, refusal management
The companies under the Evergreen Group are arranged according to Zhang Rong’s pre-arrangement and are managed by professional managers. They are no longer the traditional family business of “Home and the World”. Family members play the role of a major shareholder to achieve the prosperity of Changrong Group. The plan for sustainable management, professional managers are elected by the legal shareholders meeting. Since the birth of Zhang Rongfa for three years, the Group's companies have operated smoothly.


The Evergreen Group is currently being managed by professional managers, and it is said that external forces will be involved in the reconstruction of the blind.

However, after the death of Zhang Rongfa, the two children and the three sons were willing to change their father’s intentions. They believed that the 30 foundations of the two foundations should be divided equally among the three brothers. The old three Zhang Guozheng believe that the Evergreen Group is the father Zhang Rongfa. The children should not be controlled by outsiders. They should be accompanied by his wife Zeng Qionghui’s family and Xie Guoxian. The joint brother Zhang Guoming wants to lead Evergreen International and wants to obtain the leadership of Zhang Rongfa’s two foundations.
The 15 directors of the board of directors of the 2 major foundations are mostly served by the employees of Evergreen Group or the sons of Zhang Rongfa. At present, the Zhang Rongfa (Cultural and Cultural) Foundation has withdrawn from the second-room independent son Zhang Guofan, forming a 7-to-7 vote for the big house and the third. Flat situation.



At present, the chairman of the Zhang Rongfa (Cultural and Cultural) Foundation and the Charity Foundation is Zhong Demei (right).



Ke Liqing (middle), Chairman of Evergreen International, is a group veteran and a professional manager.


As for the Zhang Rongfa Charity Foundation in Dongsuo’s double-package, the boss has only 6 votes. If the boss is re-elected in the future, the old three Zhang Guoming and the second child Zhang Guoming will have an absolute advantage of 9 votes. They will have the opportunity to change and change. At present, Zhang Guohua, the boss, supports the layout of professional managers.
The disagreement between the big brothers and the brothers has been lingering since the dispute was extended on December 11 last year. On the same day, the Zhang Rongfa (Cultural and Cultural) Foundation was re-elected, not only a series of violence and intimidation incidents, but also successive litigation, the old three Zhang Guozheng proposed 7 In the case of the lawsuit, three of them have been lost. Later, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health and Welfare of the Foundation also intervened to request improvement. In the meantime, there was also a legislator and a member of the Luolu Mountain who was known as the ""Blue Camp"". Centered and eager to run.

Former Evergreen consultant announced that it will change
People familiar with the matter pointed out that Zhuluoshan was a consultant of Evergreen Group, but currently there is no title and office in Evergreen Group. There are still many people inside the group who have received his message, alleging that Evergreen Group is about to change, because of Zhuluoshan people. In the last presidential election, he accurately predicted that the Kuomintang would change the column, but predicted that other elections had failed many times. Now his prediction of Evergreen, although it has caused discussion within Evergreen, has become insignificant.


Zhang Rongfa's second-room son, Zhang Guofan (left), created Xingyu Airlines and faded out of the Evergreen Group. The picture shows Zhang Guofan personally kicking back the new aircraft of Xingyu Airlines on October 28.

In the past year, in addition to the trilogy of the gangsters, the lawsuits, and the competent authorities, political and religious circles have also been arguing, and the third party, Xie Guoxian, who was arrested by the ""organized crime"" defendant, repeatedly stressed the underworld and intimidation. The incident has nothing to do with him. The low-key second-year Zhang Guoming broke the silence for the first time, and the chairman of the counter-control foundation, Zhong Demei, lost his job.


The Evergreen Group was struggling to survive the strike storm, but it was once again on the news page due to the dispute over management rights.

The three sons of Zhang Rongfa’s big house have been fierce in the battle for management rights. They have their own persistence. On the surface, Evergreen’s guilt seems to be a brother-in-law wall. Now it is said that the gangster’s intervention and the third wife’s family involvement in the seizure of power, how to solve the Zhang Rongfa Charity Foundation The chairman of the board double-disputed disputes and resolved the deadlock to avoid the turmoil of the Evergreen Group with a market value of 400 billion yuan, which is testing the wisdom of the Zhangjia brothers and the competent authorities.
