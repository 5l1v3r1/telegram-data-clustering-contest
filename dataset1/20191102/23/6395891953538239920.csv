NEEDHAM, Mass. (AP) - The remains of a Massachusetts U.S. Army officer killed in WWII have been identified and returned to his hometown of Needham.
A hearse carrying the remains of U.S. Army 1st Lt. Joseph Edward Finneran was escorted by state police to a funeral home Friday night after a ceremony at Logan Airport.
The Boston Fire Department along with firefighters from Newtown, Wellesley, Sharon, and Brookline saluted Finneran's return.
The Boston Globe reports that a death notice for 22-year-old Finneran was published in the paper in 1943 after his B-24D aircraft was shot down in Ploesti, Romania that August.
Finneran received multiple awards posthumously, including the Purple Heart.
Finneran was born and raised in Needham and later moved to Boston with his family.
His nephew provided his DNA to help identify the remains.
