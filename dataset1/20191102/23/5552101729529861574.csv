【全文】遛狗激發賀爾蒙　陳孝萱唇戀咖啡名店老闆
02 Nov 2019, 23:28 by 娛樂組, 攝影組
把兒子鐵弟送出國念書後，陳孝萱終於能有時間談戀愛了。本刊直擊，她忙著熱黏新歡，緊牽咖啡店老闆柳建名漫步街頭，而且賀爾蒙衝腦時，這對熟女熟男不自禁地偷玩親親，畫面甜到掉渣。再進一步追查，柳建名雖然網傳有過老婆，但目前婚姻狀態未明，不過人定居基隆的他，已經熟門熟路地經常入住陳孝萱台北市東區的華廈，讓這段微遠距離的祕戀也可說是暗潮洶湧。



距離陳孝萱與詹仁雄轟轟烈烈的離婚，已經過了12年，隨著詹仁雄再婚生女，而且跟陳孝萱也在前一陣子，順利把兒子鐵弟送去英倫貴族學校，陳孝萱總算能夠有時間留給自己，繼續發展新的一段熟年戀愛。之前本刊曾經獨家報導陳孝萱「遇到有小十幾歲的男性追求」「身邊確實有還滿會照顧人的朋友」，最近果然直擊她其實還另有固定新歡。


9/27 陳孝萱的穿著輕便，遛狗回到她台北市東區的華廈。

　
等電梯親臉頰　甜蜜
10月15日下午1點多，陳孝萱造訪家附近的髮廊跟牙醫，然後回到台北市東區的住處。直到傍晚，有名熟男牽著一隻頗眼熟的狗出來散步，果然經過比對，就是之前陳孝萱身邊常出現的那隻；加上男子遛完狗後，同樣也是回到陳孝萱所住的樓層，加上他後來出門採買，沒多久就帶著不只一人份的晚餐回家，種種跡象都已散發出「陳孝萱家有男主人進駐」一股的甜蜜氣息。



10/15 17:05 陳孝萱的新歡叫作柳建名，他除了跟她有幾乎相同花色的袋子，且以男主人的姿態遛著陳孝萱的狗狗，看起來還算慈眉善目。



18:27 陳孝萱跟柳建名都沒有遮掩，在大庭廣眾之下親暱約會。



18:28 幾乎很多時候陳孝萱都勾著柳建名的手，背影看來有股熟年浪漫氛圍。


果然！餐後陳孝萱就緊勾著熟男漫步在台北市的街頭，毫無避諱的大方態度，看得他們很把握當下，一分一秒絕不輕易浪費地沉浸在幸福當中。只是接著這對熟年情侶跟一名男的會合之後，一起到了某棟商業大樓的地下室，參加某個「多層次直銷」公司的講座；結束後陳孝萱同樣又挽著熟男，時不時牽了一下小手，然後又到速食店跟另名男子會合；聊了好一陣子，他們才搭著小黃再回到陳孝萱家。



21:31 勾完手不夠，陳孝萱（右）與柳建名（左）還十指緊扣，可見得摯愛正濃。



21:44 就算是坐在普通、平價的速食店，陳孝萱跟柳建名還是滿臉幸福。


2人一起下車進門，等電梯的時候，熟男似乎禁不住陳孝萱的緊黏，忍不住輕吻了一下她的臉頰；只是以為他們前戲作足，但回到陳孝萱家才約10分鐘，熟男就又整裝完畢，離開她家，然後趕緊衝去搭上一輛開往基隆的國道巴士；原來這名熟男住在基隆，而且經查，他是當地知名「丸角自轉生活咖啡」及「丸角後院」老闆柳建名。



21:57 用完餐後，陳孝萱跟柳建名看似有其他副業，也跟直銷方面稍微取經。



21:58 陳孝萱跟柳建名一起戀戀小黃，呈現女前男後的紳士體位。



22:06 回到陳孝萱家後，柳建名忍不住親了女友一下，看來他們仍然保有生活的小情趣。



22:19 其實柳建名不是長住陳孝萱家，他的店跟自己住處都在基隆，所以約會完就要趕巴士。



22:52 下車之後，柳建名忙著滑手機，跟一般時下年輕人無異。


　
又老婆又女友　謎樣
柳建名原本在基隆、九份一帶經營單車咖啡，只是根據2013年某篇部落格文章的內容，後來他選擇在與老婆開的日本進口服飾店同條路上，開了如今的「丸角自轉生活咖啡」，店內風格日系、「成熟內斂」，並且他也擅長跟客人聊天、抬槓；咖啡店在網路上的風評不錯，也有多則網路及平面媒體報導，而Google地圖上的星等也頗高。



10/16 18:10 柳建名是基隆知名咖啡店「丸角自轉生活咖啡」的老闆，在當地小有名氣。



20:42 不只約會，柳建名的咖啡事業也頗忙碌，還曾接受多家媒體訪問。


本刊其實在2017年採訪過柳建名，寫的是他後來新開的「丸角後院」，其中短短的內容包括「丸角咖啡的店主 James（柳建名）租下原本經營黑膠唱片行的店面，改造成小型的一人咖啡館，提供給對咖啡有夢想的人。若想嘗試經營咖啡館，在這裡可以體驗當一天老闆…」等等字句。
八卦的是，本刊記者2年前在採訪時，柳建名卻說店會開在基隆，竟是因為「女友」的關係，而不是2013年所記載的「老婆」；於是柳建名如今跟陳孝萱交往，背後的婚姻狀態成為謎團；另外根據《安可人生》雜誌報導，柳建名本來跟大部分的基隆人一樣，原本是通勤台北的電子業上班族，後來不想作息一成不變，所以才會改行賣起咖啡。
　
基隆往返台北　求愛
回到10月16日時，柳建名留在基隆咖啡店內，工作了一整天，然後就回到自己住處；不過時間到了10月18日，他同樣收拾忙完後，結果獨自去搭客運，一路把自己送上了陳孝萱的家門；尤其柳建名看來已經擁有了她家所有鑰匙，只見他家常便飯地長驅直入了那棟華廈，然後整夜沒再見到兩人行蹤。



10/18 22:24 其實柳建名已經擁有陳孝萱家的鑰匙，供他自由進出。



22:28 柳建名跟陳孝萱雖然是微遠距離戀愛，但兩人相聚同睡的頻率也高。


過了一夜，到了10月19日下午2點多，只見陳孝萱一人從家中出門，隨意在敦南誠品附近閒晃，但是完全不見柳建名的身影；直到晚上9點10分左右，才又看到柳建名拿著屬於的自己鑰匙，接著進了陳孝萱家；於是以台北至基隆如此不近又不遠的距離，經常見面、偶爾過夜的頻率，這對男女之間進度也能稱得上「類同居」的階段。

陳孝萱跟詹仁雄離婚之後的12年間，上過檯面的戀情，只有一段是跟《黑糖群俠傳》導演于華坤。不過于華坤同時又跟潘儀君不清不楚，等於是陳孝萱介入他們之間；當時潘儀君還說：「在我身邊一定壓力很大，是該讓他出去喘口氣了。」結果于華坤後來沒多久就跟陳孝萱分手，跑去跟潘儀君復合，一度論及婚嫁卻無疾而終。
　
兒子倫敦留學　爆貴
在這之後，陳孝萱幾乎獨自扶養兒子鐵弟，認命過著單親媽媽生活，沒再高調戀愛；日前本刊也獨家報導，她陪著鐵弟飛往英國倫敦，就讀私立的貴族中學，據悉，1年學費要價高達新台幣250萬元，金援的則是鐵弟的爸詹仁雄。


陳孝萱曾帶過鐵弟公開亮相；鐵弟長大之後，還會幫陳孝萱物色對象，算是體貼。（翻攝自mag.chinayes.com）

「親友心疼表示，這12年來，陳孝萱為了照顧兒子，幾乎不接長時間的工作，更曾有千萬元酬勞的戲劇邀約找她，但因為須到外地拍攝，她也毅然拒絕…很多男人追求，但為了將心力留給兒子，多年來情場仍空白。」沒想到把鐵弟送出國沒多久，果然就有柳建名的出現。


陳孝萱談戀愛與結婚到目前都頗曲折，她扶養兒子鐵弟並把他送出國後，才有自己的時間談戀愛。

至於詹仁雄，2016年他就已被爆出再婚小16歲的嫩妻小梅；「小梅個性乖又聽話，非常懂得給詹仁雄空間，不會沒事奪命催魂call，很得詹仁雄喜愛。」2人並且育有1女；只是憶當年吳「宗」憲、陳「孝」萱、詹「仁」雄的「忠（宗）孝仁」愛三角關係更是轟動一時。

感情滿城風雨　辛酸
2000年左右，吳宗憲除了忙著送豪宅、名車給陳孝萱，一邊也還跟譚元俐（ Candy）糾纏不清，後竟爆出吳宗憲已婚，而且還有4個小孩；接著陳孝萱憤而轉愛詹仁雄，並且先有後婚，但2年多就離了。

之前陳孝萱還有跟黃文豪結婚又「分手」，傳出私下只寫離婚協議書的她犯了「重婚罪」，不過陳孝萱則解釋：「不會有大家所擔心的那些問題」，因為並沒去戶政事務所登記。
陳孝萱一路來感情談得滿城風雨，網路媒體有對她情史下過總整理標題，「她曾經是最佳學生情人，卻屢屢遇人不淑」，既犀利卻也算精準。

[Full Text] Hyena Inspires Hermon Chen Xiaoyan Lip Love Coffee Shop Owner
02 Nov 2019, 23:28 by Entertainment Group, Photography Group
After sending his son Tie Di to the country to study, Chen Xiaoyu finally has time to fall in love. The journal hits straight, she is busy with hot new love, holding the coffee shop owner Liu Jianming to walk the streets, and when the hormones rushed to the brain, the mature woman can not help but steal the kiss, the picture is sweet to the slag. Further investigation, although Liu Jianming has had a wife in the network, but the current state of marriage is not clear, but he settled in Keelung, he is already familiar with the road, often staying in the Huaxia of the eastern part of Taipei City, let this secret of the distance Love can also be said to be a dark tide.



It’s been 12 years since Chen Xiaoxuan and Zhan Renxiong’s divorce. After Zeng Renxiong’s remarriage and birth, and Chen Xiaoxuan’s a while ago, he sent his son Tiedi to the British Aristocratic School. Chen Xiaoyu finally has time to leave it. Self, continue to develop a new age of love. Previously, this magazine had exclusively reported that Chen Xiaoxuan ""has met a man with a small teenage age."" ""There are indeed friends who are still full of caring people."" Recently, she actually had a new love.


9/27 Chen Xiaoyu's dress is light and the dog walks back to Huaxia in the eastern part of Taipei.


Waiting for the elevator to kiss the cheeks sweet
At 1 pm on October 15th, Chen Xiaoyu visited the hair salon and dentist near his home, and then returned to the residence in the eastern district of Taipei. Until the evening, a well-known man took a rather familiar dog out for a walk. Sure enough, after the comparison, it was the one that appeared before Chen Xiaoxuan; and after the man finished the dog, he also returned to the floor where Chen Xiaoyu lived. In addition, he later went out to buy it, and soon he took home with more than one dinner. All the signs have already shed the sweet smell of ""Chen Xiaoyu's family has a male owner.""



10/15 17:05 Chen Xiaoxuan's new joy is called Liu Jianming. He has a bag of almost the same color as her, and he looks at the dog of Chen Xiaoyu in the attitude of the male master. It looks pretty kind and eye-catching.



18:27 Chen Xiaoxuan and Liu Jianming did not cover up, and they were dating in the audience.



18:28 Almost many times, Chen Xiaoyu is hooked on Liu Jianming's hand, and his back seems to have a romantic atmosphere.


really! After the meal, Chen Xiaoyu walked on the streets of Taipei City with a slap in the face of a mature man. He saw that they were very convinced that the moment they were in the moment, they would not be wasted and immersed in happiness. Just after the couple of mature couples met with a man, they went to the basement of a commercial building to attend a lecture of a ""multi-level direct sales company"". After the end, Chen Xiaoyu also took a familiar man, and took a small hand from time to time. Then I went to the fast food restaurant to meet another man. After chatting for a while, they took Xiao Huang and returned to Chen Xiaoyu’s home.



21:31 The hook is not enough. Chen Xiaoxuan (right) and Liu Jianming (left) are still clasping their fingers.



21:44 Even if he is sitting in an ordinary, affordable fast food restaurant, Chen Xiaoyu and Liu Jianming are still full of happiness.


When two people got out of the car and got into the door, when the elevator was waiting, the mature man couldn’t help Chen Xiaoyu’s tight adhesion. He couldn’t help but kiss her cheek gently; he just thought they were doing the foreplay, but it’s only about 10 minutes before returning to Chen Xiao’s house. The man was finished again, left her home, and then rushed to catch a national road bus to Keelung; the original man lived in Keelung, and after investigation, he was a well-known local ""Pillcorn Rotating Life Coffee"" And Liu Jianming, the owner of ""Pailcorn Backyard"".



21:57 After using the meal, Chen Xiaoyu and Liu Jianming seem to have other sideline businesses, and they also learn a little from direct sales.



21:58 Chen Xiaoxuan and Liu Jianming are in love with Xiao Huang, presenting the position of a gentleman after the former female.



22:06 After returning to Chen Xiaoyu's home, Liu Jianming couldn't help but kiss his girlfriend. It seems that they still have a small interest in life.



22:19 In fact, Liu Jianming did not live in Chen Xiaoyu's home. His shop and his residence are in Keelung, so he will catch the bus after the date.



22:52 After getting off the bus, Liu Jianming was busy sliding the phone, no different from the young people in general.



Wife and girlfriend, mystery
Liu Jianming originally operated bicycle coffee in Keelung and Jiufen. It was based on the content of a blog post in 2013. Later, he chose to open the current ""Marble Point Rotation"" on the same road as the Japanese imported clothing store opened with his wife. ""Life Coffee"", the store style is Japanese, ""mature and restrained"", and he is also good at chatting with guests and lifting the bar; the coffee shop has a good reputation on the Internet, and there are many online and print media reports, and the stars on Google Maps. It is also quite high.



10/16 18:10 Liu Jianming is the owner of Keelung's famous coffee shop ""Maru Jiao Rotating Life Coffee"", which is famous in the local area.



20:42 Not only dating, Liu Jianming's coffee business is quite busy, but also received a number of media interviews.


In fact, this magazine interviewed Liu Jianming in 2017. He wrote the newly opened ""Pillcorn Backyard"". The short content includes ""Machine (Mr. Liu Jianming), the owner of Maruko Coffee, renting the original black plastic. The storefront of the record store has been transformed into a small one-person coffee shop for those who have dreams of coffee. If you want to try to run a coffee shop, you can experience the boss of the day..."" and so on.
Gossip, when the reporter of this journal was interviewed two years ago, Liu Jianming said that the store would open in Keelung because of the relationship of ""girlfriend"" rather than the ""wife"" recorded in 2013; then Liu Jianming is now with Chen Xiaoyu’s marital status behind him became a mystery. According to the Encore Life magazine, Liu Jianming was originally the same as the Keelung people. He was originally a commuter in Taipei’s electronics industry. Later, he did not want to work and rest. Changed to sell coffee.

Keelung to and from Taipei
Back on October 16th, Liu Jianming stayed at the Keelung Coffee Shop for a whole day and then returned to his place of residence. However, on October 18th, he also packed up and went to take passengers alone. All the way to send himself to the door of Chen Xiaoyu; especially Liu Jianming seems to have all the keys of her family, I saw his family often drive straight into the building, and then did not see the two disappeared all night.



10/18 22:24 In fact, Liu Jianming already has the key to Chen Xiaolan’s family, allowing him to enter and leave freely.



22:28 Although Liu Jianming and Chen Xiaoyu are in love for a long distance, the frequency of the two people gathering together is also high.


After one night, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon of October 19, I saw Chen Xiaoyu go out from home and arbitrarily swayed around Dunnan Eslite, but I did not see Liu Jianming at all; until 9:10 pm, it was only after I saw Liu Jianming holding his own key, and then went to Chen Xiaoyu’s home; so the distance between Taipei and Keelung was so close and not too far, the frequency of frequent meetings and occasional overnight stays. The stage of ""cohabitation"".



Although Chen Xiaoxuan and Zhan Renxiong’s marriage were short-lived, the man also provided financial aid after the divorce and gave his son a raise. (Oriental IC)



Pan Yijun’s feelings were once intervened by Chen Xiaoyu, the leading actor was director Yu Huakun. (Reflected from Pan Yijun Weibo)


In the 12 years after Chen Xiaoxuan and Zhan Renxiong divorced, there was only one paragraph in the relationship with the director of ""Brown Sugar Heroes"" Yu Huakun. However, Yu Huakun was not clear with Pan Yijun at the same time. It was equal to Chen Xiaoyu intervening between them. At that time, Pan Yijun also said: ""There must be a lot of pressure around me. It is time for him to go out and take a breath."" It didn't take long for Chen Xiaoyu to break up and ran to Pan Yijun, who once talked about marriage but did not die.

My son, studying in London, is expensive.
After that, Chen Xiaoxuan almost raised his son, the younger brother, and lived a life with a single mother. He did not have a high-profile love. Recently, the magazine also reported exclusively that she accompanied the younger brother to London, England, to attend a private aristocratic middle school. It is reported that 1 The annual tuition fee is as high as NT$2.5 million, and the gold aid is the iron brother’s father, Zhan Renxiong.


Chen Xiaoxuan once took the iron brother public appearance; after the iron brother grew up, he would help Chen Xiaoxuan to find the object, which is considerate. (Revolving from mag.chinayes.com)

""My relatives and friends are distressed and said that in the past 12 years, in order to take care of her son, Chen Xiaoyu has hardly taken a long time to work, and she has been invited to find her by a drama of 10 million yuan. However, because she has to shoot outside, she has resolutely refused... many men pursue However, in order to leave his heart to his son, the love field is still blank for many years."" I didn't expect to send the younger brother to the country for a long time, and there was the appearance of Liu Jianming.


Chen Xiaoxuan’s love and marriage have been quite tortuous. She has had her own time to fall in love after she raised her son and sent him out of the country.

As for Zhan Renxiong, in 2016, he has been smashed out to remarriage the younger wife, Xiaomei, who is 16 years old. ""Xiaomei is very obedient and obedient, and she knows how to give Zhan Renxiong space. It will not kill the soul call, and it is very popular with Zhan Renxiong."" There are 2 women and 1 woman; it is only a sensation to remember that the ""Zong"" of the ""Zong"" constitution, Chen ""filial piety"", and Zhan ""ren"" males.

Feelings full of wind and rain
Around 2000, Wu Zongxian was busy sending a mansion and a famous car to Chen Xiaoxuan. He was also entangled with Tan Yuanzhang (Candy). Later, Wu Zongxian was married and had four children. Then Chen Xiaoyu turned to love Zhan Renxiong. And first married, but more than two years away.


Chen Xiaoyu was pursued by Wu Zongxian in the past, but Wu Zongxian was actually married and had children. (Reflected from the Internet)

Before that, Chen Xiaoxuan was married to Huang Wenhao and ""divided"". She reported that she had committed a ""bigamy crime"" when she only wrote a divorce agreement. However, Chen Xiaoyu explained: ""There will be no problems that everyone is worried about"" because they have not gone. Registration of the household office.
Chen Xiaoxuan came to the city with all the way to talk about the feelings of the city. The online media had a general title for her love history. ""She used to be the best student lover, but she often missed people."" It is both sharp and accurate.
