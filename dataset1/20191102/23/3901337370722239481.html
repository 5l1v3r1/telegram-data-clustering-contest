      <p>The Glamour Boys fought back from behind to get level with the Buccaneers after Fortune Makaringe's first half goal put the Buccaneers in the driving seat, however a red card for Mthokozisi Dube opened up the opportunity for them to capitalise.</p>
      <p>An equaliser from Leonardo Castro sent it to extra time and then a Daniel Cardoso penalty put Chiefs ahead in the final half an hour, but Gabadinho Mhango's late strike meant that the game would be decided in a shootout.</p>
      <p>It was then that Daniel Akpeyi, a player who has split opinion since coming in for Itumeleng Khune, came to the rescue as he kept out both Ben Motshwari and Abel Mabaso, with all four of the Amakhosi's stars slotting past Wayne Sandilands to give the Glamour Boys the win.</p>
