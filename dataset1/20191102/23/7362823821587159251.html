      <p>Lt. Fan Yang, 34; his wife Yang Yang, 33; Ge Songtao, 49; and Zheng Yan, 27, were charged with "conspiring to submit false export information and to fraudulently attempt to export articles from the United States," according to the department.</p>

      <p>Prosecutors alleged that Fan Yang and his wife were in contact with two Chinese nationals and were paid $205,000 to smuggle inflatable boats from September 2018 through this past October, court documents said. It is illegal for a foreign national to get a weapon.</p>
