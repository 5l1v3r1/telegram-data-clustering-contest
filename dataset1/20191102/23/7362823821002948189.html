      <p>Rudy Boesch, a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/veterans">retired</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/navy">Navy</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military">SEAL</a> who became a fan favorite on the first season of  "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv">Survivor</a>," has <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/obituary">died</a> after a battle with Alzheimer’s disease. He was 91.</p>
      <p>Boesch died peacefully Friday night in hospice care in Virginia Beach, Va., surrounded by loved ones, said Steve Gonzalez, director of operations for the SEAL Veterans Foundation.</p>
      <p>"He was a legend in the SEAL teams long before 'Survivor,'" Gonzalez said. "Rudy was beloved by all and will be deeply missed."</p>
      <p>Boesch was part of the debut cast of "Survivor" in 2000, coming in third place. At 72 years old, Boesch was the oldest contestant ever on the CBS show. He proved so popular as a no-nonsense but loveable character that he was invited back for the eighth season, "Survivor: All Stars."</p>

      <p>Before his retirement, Boesch was honored as "Chief SEAL," or "Bullfrog." The title marks his time as the longest-serving SEAL still on active duty. He remained involved after he left the Navy, serving on the board of directors of the UDT SEAL Association.</p>
      <p>Boesch's wife of 53 years, Marjorie Thomas, died in 2008. They have three daughters. Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced Saturday.</p>
