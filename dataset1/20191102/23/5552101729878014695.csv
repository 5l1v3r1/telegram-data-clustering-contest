【悠活臺南】打造臺南最長壽音樂季　德籍藝術家Axel在臺三十年
02 Nov 2019, 23:13 by 陳毅偉
說起臺灣的音樂祭活動，大部分人想到的是：南端的春吶、北端的貢寮海洋，卻少有人注意到，臺南也有這麼一個獨立樂團表演舞台－臺南5月音樂季Tainan May Jam，和貢寮海洋音樂祭同自2000年開始，創辦人是來自德國的藝術家Axel，在臺灣落地生根近30年，最愛的臺灣美食竟是讓許多外國朋友聞之卻步的臭豆腐。
Axel，一位來臺30年、在臺南long stay超過25年的德國藝術家，對初相見不曉得怎麼唸他名字的人，會打趣地叫你和他說聲「egg sell」(賣雞蛋)，逗趣教學讓人從此不會忘記他的名字。不過這樣的幽默風趣，僅限舞台上表演時和樂迷互動與在街頭表演時，在安親班兼任美語教學的Axel老師，可是不苟言笑，這一點又提醒了我們：德國人就是如此嚴謹與一絲不苟。


剛過60歲生日的Axel，依舊活力滿滿，不只辦音樂季、做藝術創作，還會定期上街頭唱歌表演。

　
非典型德人　為愛來臺
對於這樣的標籤，Axel說，自己其實很不德國，從小就不適應母親的德國式教條，個性上反而比較像羅馬尼亞籍的父親，熱愛藝術，嚮往自由奔放。來臺灣的歷程也和他的天性一樣浪漫，因為在印度靈修時邂逅臺灣女子，相識相戀到決定落腳臺南，雖然這段婚姻維持20年後宣告結束，Axel和這塊土地卻已結下不解之緣。


Axel的創作多樣，有大膽用色，也有浪漫風格，偶爾還會加入一些浮誇的幽默。

談到剛來臺灣的感受，即使Axel覺得自己不像典型的德國人，仍舊不習慣當時臺灣的紊亂，馬路上會被逼車，買東西會被插隊，垃圾也沒分類概念，不過待了近30年，一路看這塊土地的人民成長，對臺灣的情感也越深，還會努力地幫忙推動環保教育，不只在他創辦的音樂季中，鼓勵大家自備杯子及餐具，在他的藝術創作裡，更是隨處可見環保風。
　
廢棄物入畫　反思物欲
海邊淨灘撿拾的保麗龍、漂流木、捕撈浮標、塑膠玩具，甚至是報廢的機車排氣管外殼，透過他的巧手，都能變身為各種逗趣臉譜、奇特的拼貼畫作。而一般人棄置的生活廢棄物，在他眼中卻是閃閃發光的寶物，運用一些巧思創意，再加入他幽默、浮誇，帶點超現實的觀點，每件作品都能讓人反思現代人追求「新、好、有｣的物欲文化，重新看見垃圾仍存有的價值。


經過Axel的巧手創作，浮標、廢棄塑膠及報廢機車排氣管外殼，神奇變身逗趣臉譜。

深植的「環保意識」與「藝術魂」燃燒時，也會有走火入魔時刻。到Axel家拜訪時發現，這位藝術家的創作素材，在家中到處堆置啊！女友Vimala笑稱，要不是在我們到訪前已經清掉過一批，原本屋裡的樣貌肯定會讓人以為進到拾荒者的倉庫。對此，Axel也無奈表示，女友比自己更像德國人，生活秩序有條有理，也幸好這項優點，偶爾幫他拉回過度天馬行空的思緒。


Axel和女友Vimala經常一塊兒打坐冥想，未來也希望將瑜珈活動帶入音樂季裡。

像是原本要聊對臺灣音樂環境的看法，沒想到聊著聊著，話題就跨越到了臺灣的政治人物熱潮，而且是越說越起勁，還是Vimala意識到這跨界內容聊太久，幫忙拉了回來。Vimala說，Axel對臺灣政治話題，比大部分臺灣人還熱衷，若不勇敢打斷，肯定一個下午都講不完。這一點也讓人看到這位藝術家在臺落地生根的程度，原來不只品嘗臭豆腐，還有這股政治狂熱。
　
自創音樂祭　耕耘19年
回歸Axel最熱衷的事情，當然還是在音樂的創作和表演，尤其在他創辦的臺南5月音樂季Tainan May Jam上，更是投注極大心血。當時創辦想法很單純，被邀請至春吶表演，見到來自各地的音樂人聚集，回想自己住的臺南，這麼一個人文薈萃的地方，怎麼就沒有這樣的音樂活動？於是開始找人、找場地、找資源，在2000年辦了第一屆的May Jam，提供舞台給獨立樂團表演，也讓喜愛各種不同音樂風格的人都有機會參與。

舉辦地點一路從安平區的海濱秋茂園，遷移到安南區的四草大橋旁水鳥餐廳，2013年相中能提供參與者更舒適寬敞場地的虎頭埤風景區。
19年來，Axel默默在這個音樂活動上耕耘，雖然沒有南北兩大音樂盛宴名聲響亮，卻也在獨立音樂圈和臺南在地表演團隊裡打出口碑，堅持「bigger is not better」，不讓自己創辦的音樂季過度商業化，單純就是享受音樂，欣賞表演，就連在周邊擺設的攤販也都是熱愛音樂者。

宛若園遊會　親子同歡
像是今年的May Jam，占比最多的觀眾竟是小朋友，許多父母帶著小孩闔家光臨，草坪鋪上墊子就地辦起野餐，大家邊欣賞表演邊倘佯在大自然的舒適氛圍裡，這讓音樂季變得更像是場園遊會，但Axel不在意，反而希望明年邁入第20年的策劃能吸引更多小朋友參與，讓大家共享一場沒有壓力、輕鬆的演唱會。

[Yuhuai Tainan] to create the longest birthday music festival in Tainan German artist Axel is in Taiwan for 30 years
02 Nov 2019, 23:13 by Chen Yiwei
Speaking of Taiwan's music festival activities, most people think of it: the spring festival in the south end and the Gongga sea in the north end, but few people have noticed that Tainan also has such an independent orchestra performance stage - Tainan May Jam in the Tainan May music season. Since the beginning of 2000, the founder is a German artist, Axel, who has been rooted in Taiwan for nearly 30 years. His favorite Taiwanese food is a stinky tofu that many foreign friends have deterred.
Axel, a German artist who has been in Taiwan for 30 years and has been staying in Tainan for more than 25 years, will be jokingly telling you to say ""egg sell"" (selling eggs) to people who don't know how to read his name. Funny teaching will never forget his name. However, this kind of humor is very interesting. It is only for the Axel teacher who is also a teacher of American language teaching in the performance of the stage when interacting with the fans and performing on the street. However, this reminds us that the Germans are so strict and meticulous.


Axel, who has just passed his 60th birthday, is still full of energy, not only for the music season, but also for artistic creation, and he will regularly perform singing on the streets.


Atypical Germans for love
For such a label, Axel said that he is actually not German. Since he was a child, he did not adapt to his mother's German dogma. His personality was more like a Romanian father. He loved art and yearned for freedom. The journey to Taiwan is as romantic as his nature, because when he was in India, he married a Taiwanese woman and fell in love with each other until he decided to settle in Tainan. Although the marriage ended 20 years later, Axel and the land have been settled. Inextricable relationship.


Axel's creations are diverse, bold and romantic, and occasionally add some exaggerated humor.

Speaking of the feeling of coming to Taiwan, even if Axel feels that he is not like a typical German, he is still not used to the disorder of Taiwan at that time. He will be forced to drive on the road, and the shopping will be cut in. The garbage is not classified, but staying close In the past 30 years, the people who have seen the land all the way have grown up, and the deeper their feelings towards Taiwan, they will also work hard to promote environmental education, not only in the music season he founded, but also encourage everyone to bring their own cups and tableware in his art. In the creation, environmental protection is everywhere.

Waste into painting, reflection on material desire
The styrofoam, driftwood, fishing buoys, plastic toys, and even the exhausted locomotive exhaust pipe shells of the clean beach at the seaside can be transformed into various funny and strange collages through his skillful hands. The waste that the average person disposes of is a gleaming treasure in his eyes. Using some ingenious ideas, he adds his humor, exaggeration, and a surreal perspective. Each piece can reflect on the pursuit of modern people. New, good, and there is a materialistic culture that re-visits the value of garbage.


After Axel's skillful creation, buoys, discarded plastics and scrapped locomotive exhaust pipe casings, magically transformed into funny faces.

When the deep-rooted ""environmental awareness"" and ""art soul"" burn, there will be a moment of ignorance. When I visited Axel, I found out that the artist’s creative materials were piled up at home! Girlfriend Vimala laughed and said that if it had not been cleared before we visited, the appearance of the original house would definitely make people think that they would enter the warehouse of the scavengers. In this regard, Axel also said that his girlfriend is more like a German than himself, and his life order is justified. Fortunately, this advantage has occasionally helped him to pull back the excessive thoughts.


Axel and his girlfriend Vimala often meditate together and hope to bring yoga activities into the music season.

It’s like thinking about the Taiwanese music environment. I didn’t expect to talk about it. The topic has crossed the enthusiasm of Taiwan’s politicians, and it’s getting more and more energetic, or Vimala realizes that this cross-border content has been chatting for too long, helping to pull Come back. Vimala said that Axel is more keen on Taiwan's political topics than most Taiwanese. If he is not brave enough to interrupt, he will definitely not finish it in one afternoon. This also makes people see the extent to which the artist has taken root in Taiwan. It is not only to taste stinky tofu, but also this political fanaticism.

Homemade music festival
The most popular thing to return to Axel, of course, is the creation and performance of music, especially in the Tainan May Jam, which he founded in the Tainan May music season. At that time, the idea of starting a school was very simple. I was invited to perform in the Spring Festival. I saw musicians from all over the world gather and recalled the Tainan where I lived. How can there be such a music event in such a place where there is a gathering of humanities? So I started looking for people, looking for venues, and looking for resources. In 2000, I opened the first May Jam, providing stage performances for independent orchestras, and also for those who love a variety of different musical styles.

The venue will be moved from the seaside autumn park in Anping District to the Waterbird Restaurant next to the Sicao Bridge in Annan District. In 2013, Xiangzhong can provide more comfortable and spacious venues for the Hutouyu Scenic Area.
In the past 19 years, Axel has quietly worked on this music event. Although there is no famous music festival in North and South, he has also made a reputation in the independent music circle and the performance team in Tainan. He insisted that ""bigger is not better"" and would not let himself start. The music season is over-commercialized. It is simply to enjoy music and enjoy performances. Even the vendors who are located in the surrounding area are also passionate about music.

Just like a garden tour, parent-child friendship
Like this year's May Jam, the most popular audience is actually a small friend. Many parents come home with their children. The lawn is covered with mats to set up a picnic on the spot. If you enjoy the performance, you will be in the comfort of nature. This makes the music season more like a garden tour, but Axel doesn't care. Instead, I hope that the plan for the 20th year next year will attract more children to participate and let everyone share a stress-free and relaxed concert.
