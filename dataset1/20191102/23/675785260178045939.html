      <h1>Ricky Gervais gets huge backlash after saying he'd dress up as trans woman for Halloween</h1>
      <h2>Ricky, 58, said he'd be Jessica Yaniv, who he called 'weird and creepy' before tweeting an unflattering photo of her</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T23:19:17+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 23:19</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Pike, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/molly-pike/</a></address>
      <p>Ricky Gervais is no stranger to a bit of Twitter controversy, but his latest joke has upset a lot of people.</p>
      <p>The comedian, 58, joked that he'd be dressing up as transgender activist Jessica Yaniv for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> , calling her "weird and creepy" and tweeting an unflattering photo of her.</p>
      <p>He posted: "I was going to dress up as something weird and creepy for my Halloween party, but I'm bucking the trend this year and I'm going as brave female activist Jessica Yaniv.</p>
      <p>"This also means I don't have to wax my big old hairy balls."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> users criticised him for poking fun, with one calling it "bigoted".</p>

      <p>They tweeted: "Come Ricky. You've done some funny stuff over the years, but this is just odious and bigoted."</p>
      <p>Another posted: "Ricky Gervais if you wanna do transphobic jokes that's fine, whatever, but can you at least try and come up with a new one."</p>
      <p>A third said: "Learning @rickygervais is transphobic is so disappointing."</p>
      <p>Noticing all the negative tweets, Ricky jokingly said he'd delete his post.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: "This tweet upset some people yesterday so I think I should apologise and delete it and never make offensive jokes like this again."</p>

      <p>Last month a human rights tribunal rejected Jessica's claim she was discriminated against when beauty therapists refused to wax her scrotum.</p>
      <p>She had contacted multiple beauty salon businesses in British Columbia, Canada, requesting waxes.</p>
      <p>A tribunal heard staff refused to perform the pubic hair removal procedure after she revealed she had a full set of male genitalia.</p>
      <p>The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal ruled she had gone on a campaign both to enrich herself at the expense of South Asians, and to punish them for what she viewed as transphobia.</p>

      <p>Now she has been forced to pay the workers over the case- which saw one forced out of business as a result of Yaniv's claim.</p>
      <p>The tribunal said Yaniv had had “manufactured the conditions for a human rights complaint” when she demanded bikini waxes from several salons despite still having a full set of male genitalia.</p>
      <p>A number of the salon workers voiced religious objections to carrying out the procedures.</p>
      <p>Others said they weren't appropriately trained in waxing a scrotum.</p>
      <p>Because some of the salons in question had never offered services to wax anyone's scrotum, the tribunal said, it could not be said to be discriminating against Ms Yaniv.</p>
