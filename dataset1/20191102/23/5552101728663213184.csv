【悠活臺南】走踏臺南聽見好聲音　May　Jam南吼　甘噪祭　貴人散步音樂節
02 Nov 2019, 23:13 by 陳毅偉
臺南這座歷史悠久的城市引人聯想到的多是古蹟建物、傳統美食，其實臺南底蘊深厚，涵養出的文化包羅萬象，少有人提及的音樂，在臺南悄悄耕耘出一片沃土，許多獨立樂團甚至以此出發，以這座城市的特有文化來當他們的創作靈感。
要講臺南最膾炙人口的音樂作品，有人可能會哼出〈南都夜曲〉，又或是〈安平追想曲〉，不過要能唱出這曲調的，興許也得有些生活歷練，若詢問20歲左右的年輕學子，那麼他唱出的內容可能是這樣：
嘗一口這甜蜜城市　那紅磚色的濃郁　用力地進入我的影子裡
用臺南特有的「偏甜口味」，哼唱出對這個城市最直接的感受，這是饒舌團體「榕幫」為臺南量身訂做的專屬歌曲〈甜蜜城市〉，這群源自成功大學、扎根臺南的音樂人，喜歡取樣各種文化樣貌融入音樂中，細火慢熬、精心調味，展現的是另一種新式臺南風味。
　

May Jam　唱過19個年頭

若你對這曲調感到陌生，除了年齡世代上的落差因素，你可能忽略的是音樂文化，已經在古都臺南耕耘出的成果。除了音樂人才輩出，音樂活動也是熱鬧騰騰，每年像接力賽一般，一場又一場的開唱，這麼一年又一年地唱下來，最長壽的音樂季竟然也唱過了19個年頭。

由德國人Axel創辦的「臺南5月音樂季Tainan May Jam」，2000年開始從海濱秋茂園一路唱到現在的虎頭埤風景區，創辦起跑點和貢寮海洋音樂祭都在同一年，即使沒有相同的響亮名聲，19年來卻也用他們的堅持，辦出特有的臺南式風格。從一開始外國觀眾較多的音樂盛會，演變到現在主體都是臺灣人，觀眾不但有老人、小孩，還是闔家共賞的演唱會，Axel定義自己創辦的這個活動「不是rock festival，而是更純粹的music festival」，在這兒你還能見到國小小朋友的表演，讓舞台不侷限哪類音樂，呈現更豐富多元。

南吼　甘噪祭　凝聚地方活力

同樣堅持純粹音樂表演，由金曲歌王謝銘祐創辦的「南吼音樂季」，也伴樂迷走過了7年，活動前經常會先邀請音樂人為南吼所需經費舉行名為「小南吼」的募款演唱，而在南吼的官方網站除了音樂訊息，也有大量安平文化的介紹，及耆老訪問記錄，讓更多人認識他們的故鄉安平，也藉此凝聚地方活力。

而在2018年崛起，在臺南掀起復刻浪潮的「甘噪祭」，就顯得相對年輕，名稱源自府城的嗜甜習慣和獨立音樂的噪動本質，是一群生活在臺南，熱愛音樂的年輕人所發起的新型態音樂節，強調節目內容25％以上都是來自臺南的演出者，同時打造一系列工作坊和實驗計畫。
　

貴人散步音樂節　嗨翻臺南

如果這些音樂活動你都還沒參加過，那不妨來認識即將於11月8日登場的「貴人散步音樂節」，在眾多樂迷熱情支持下，今年邁入第三屆，連續3天活動，邀集超過60組樂團演出，還有8場國際音樂論壇，從6個場館一路延伸到整個市區，要讓樂迷「嗨翻」臺南。

在今年的樂團徵選中，近半數的樂團都來自國外，顯見音樂節在國際間已經具有相當程度影響力，節目策劃最後是敲定1/3的外團演出，保留2/3的演出名額給臺灣樂團，藉此機會將臺灣好聲音推向國際，讓國外產業人士看到臺灣音樂圈的無限潛能。


成團不到2年的羣青，今年也將躍上貴人散步音樂節的舞台。

在這些優秀的臺灣音樂團體名單中，有多個是自臺南發跡的實力樂團，除大家熟知的「甜約翰」、「榕幫」，今年還找來2018年初成團的「羣青」，以極致的藍色為名，就像他們的樂風，飄忽而浪漫，也正貼合「貴人散步音樂節」悠然自在的節奏。「羣青」成員清一色來自成功大學，目前參加過的大型音樂活動是「甘噪祭」，在這回國內外眾多樂團名單中或許顯得青澀，卻也更凸顯音樂節的兼容並蓄，讓觀眾有機會見到更多元的樂風。

串連在地特色　豐富多元

「貴人散步音樂節」在首屆創舉引進國外「showcase音樂節」模式時，就受到各界好評，不但提供獨立音樂者與國際選團人交流的平台，也將臺灣音樂推向世界舞台。 每一年的貴人散步音樂節還會安排一個「主題國家」，從第一年泰國、第二年菲律賓，到今年是新加坡，希望讓音樂節不只是看表演的場合，還能是產業人士與樂團、樂迷互相交流的場域。

在這裡，樂迷不僅能一次見到多國樂團超強卡司，貴人散步音樂節也打破過往看團場域限制，音樂節散落在臺南各個場地，前2屆表演場所還曾串連特色老店、藝文展覽空間和在地小吃，今年延續這項風格，同時也會有臺南老屋導覽活動，讓整趟音樂旅程更加二校已存豐富多元。
