【全文】劉德音未雨綢繆　台積電600億屏東蓋太陽能電廠
02 Nov 2019, 23:28 by 陳仲興, 董孟航, 王均峰, 林育緯
10月17日，台積電在法說會交出亮麗成績單，讓法人機構非常滿意，繼續加碼手中持股，外資也不斷調高台積電的目標價到300元以上，這也讓台積電市值頻創歷史新高。
然而，接棒台積電董事長一年多的劉德音看得長遠，由於台積電3奈米新廠耗電量大，加上蘋果公司等客戶端要求採用綠電，他未雨綢繆，計畫砸600億元，在屏東興建台灣規模最大的太陽能電廠，再度跨足太陽能產業。



上週三（10月23日），屏東縣「林後四林平地森林園區」豔陽高照，站在園區內仍可感受到30度的炎熱高溫，園區裡密密麻麻的小葉欖仁樹林，似乎沒有發揮太多的降溫效果。


屏東潮州鎮林後四林平地森林園區是台糖土地，也是外界點名台積電大電廠的熱門預定地之一。

屏東的每日平均日照可達6.16小時，有利於發展太陽能電廠，未來這片人煙稀少的林地可能被夷為平地，眼前的綠色森林將變成一片又一片的藍色太陽能板，因為台積電計畫砸600億元在屏東蓋太陽能大電廠，該地是熱門的預定地名單之一。
記者向工作人員詢問森林園區可能變成電廠的傳聞，對方回答：「有聽說，但是不知道電廠確切的地點會在哪裡。」進一步詢問如果設太陽能電廠，這麼多的樹要怎麼處理？工作人員說：「可能要砍掉不少。」


劉德音（左）從台積電創辦人張忠謀（右）手中接下棒子，不負眾望交出漂亮成績單。

業績攀頂　成吃電怪獸
7月11日，台積電在環評會議中就公開表示，為了達到政府要求採用20％綠電的目標，正與屏東縣政府洽談合作，希望主導開發大型太陽能電廠。屏東縣政府也證實，台積電初步鎖定屏東台糖土地作為電廠基地，電廠規模裝置容量達123萬千瓦，相當於已除役的核一廠規模，發電量15億度，估計需要1,200公頃的用地，台積電提出構想與地點後，希望藉由國發會跨部會協調，在用地取得上更順利。
若以每公頃5,000萬元的建置經費估計，台積電投入經費將超過600億元，這也是台積電董事長劉德音去年6月接棒以來，在晶圓代工領域之外，最大規模的一筆投資。

劉德音上任一年多，交出一張亮麗的成績單。由於台積電在7奈米先進製程的晶片技術已經取得市場獨大地位，大客戶蘋果公司的iPhone 11銷售量也優於預期，台積電市值頻頻創下歷史新高，10月16日股價更一度攻上298元的高點。台積電創辦人張忠謀預計出席11月2日舉行的運動會，表達對新團隊經營績效的肯定。
帶領台積電業績再創高峰之際，劉德音不敢放鬆，他早早規劃未來台積電在綠能的布局。究竟為何執全球半導體牛耳的台積電要跨入綠能，自己蓋大電廠呢？


台積電明年第1季要量產的5奈米新廠，用電量比有56萬人口的東台灣用電量還要大。（特約攝影林韋言）

台積電去年用了130億度的電，但光是明年第一季要量產的5奈米，用電量就比起東台灣56萬人口的用電量還要大；加上年底動工的3奈米，預計在2022年量產，一年用電更高達77億度，相當於台積電去年總用電量的59.23％，並超過台南市一年的民生及商業用電，用電量接近全台3％，成長速度有如吃電怪獸。
　
為保接單　再入太陽能
台灣環保聯盟學術委員會召集人吳明全表示，蘋果公司和Google已經逐步使用100%的綠電，也要求台積電等供應商使用綠電，過去台積電都是向國外買綠電憑證，現階段該公司先努力達到20％綠電的目標，再逐步跟著蘋果的腳步提高到100%，但是如果未來綠電還是不夠，台積電就會面臨無法接單的風險。
此外，經濟部《再生能源發展條例》中，也要求像台積電這樣的用電大戶，未來每年取得實際用電量一定比例必須採用綠電或購買綠電，眼看使用綠電勢在必行，劉德音因此積極評估開發建置太陽能電廠，而台灣最南端、日照時間最長的屏東是最理想的蓋廠地點。

台積電的屏東大電廠計畫若成真，將成為台灣最大的太陽能電廠。目前台灣最大的太陽能電廠是台電的彰濱光電，裝置容量為10萬千瓦，預計明年完工的台南七股鹽田則為15萬千瓦，未來台積電屏東太陽能電廠如果完工，發電量將是彰濱光電的12.3倍。
然而，與競爭對手的差距越拉越遠，在晶圓代工領域取得領先地位的台積電，跨入太陽能電廠的布局，卻面臨各界質疑與反對聲浪。
　
鏟平園區　諷變砍樹店
台灣智慧綠能產業聯盟創會理事長陳仁達，不客氣地說：「經過多方查證，台糖為了供地給台積電，將把潮州鎮林後四林平地森林園區十幾萬棵樹砍光，『台積電』變成『砍樹店』嗎？如果一砍十幾萬棵，應該會在全球出名。」


屏東的台糖土地可能成為太陽能電廠用地，未來這片森林可能變成一塊塊的太陽能板。

陳仁達甚至在臉書發表公開貼文評論，「張忠謀退休後，台積電改變了，決定要自己投入發電，一方面可以節省大筆電費，一方面也表示自己支持環保。不過，台積電可能沒發覺，這個決定可能讓自己跌進一個大坑裡。」
「台灣不缺電，缺的是綠電！」台灣環保聯盟學術委員會召集人吳明全說：「綠電是國安問題，我們支持台積電蓋太陽能電廠，但他們要先通過環評。」
　
地主台糖　年收30億
「台糖在屏東的樹是人造林，這些樹不是不能砍，但是要解決護樹團體的抗爭問題。」知情人士說，2015年台積電中科廠擴廠時，就曾經為護樹團體和環保團體的抗爭困擾多時，因此，台糖雖然願意配合政策幫台積電找地，但希望樹是由台積電來砍。

本刊調查，除了潮州鎮以外，新埤鄉的林地以及枋寮鄉北邊的台糖昌隆農場四周區塊，也都被認為可能成為台積電太陽能電廠的預定地，對於這些偏僻的林地和農地可能變成太陽能電廠，地方人士的意見兩極。
潮州鎮長周品全說：「如果要砍掉現有的樹木，就不太恰當，應該要再考量。」但新埤鄉公所主管則認為，設太陽能電廠很好，不但可以繁榮經濟、帶動就業人口，也可以有效利用土地。潮州鎮這幾年的發展不錯，人口呈現淨流入的狀況，新埤鄉則是淨流出，所以立場不太一樣。
台糖在屏東大面積閒置土地如果順利轉為太陽能電廠，一方面可以解決台積電缺電問題，台糖也可增加一大筆收入，以100公頃年租金1億元計算，台糖在屏東縣林地若有3,000公頃，等於國庫一年就可以增加30億元的收入。
除了各界對於伐樹種電看法分歧以外，台積電內部對於興建太陽能電廠，也有不同的意見。

中科砍樹爭議　台積電轉戰台南
2015年，台積電原本計畫在中科擴建1大型晶圓廠，但環評通過後，當地護樹團體發現，中科已經開始整地，大面積樹木遭到移除，當時有上百名以婦女和兒童為主的民眾，前往台中市政府和工地抗議。
環保團體認為，台積電新廠約53公頃，需要砍掉15萬棵樹，可能導致空氣品質惡化；當時還有全台不到千株的稀少樹種狗花椒，其中9成以上分布在大肚山，成為外界關切的議題。
由於台積電中科擴廠被護樹團體和環保團體轟得遍體鱗傷，前台中市長林佳龍甚至被諷為「砍樹市長」，後來台積電的5奈米和3奈米新廠選址也因此排除台中，轉到台南。

　
電廠不滿　獨厚台積電
贊成的一方認為，台積電的工廠光是維持無塵室、還沒生產，一年就需要60多億元的電費，新的EUV（極紫外光）製程更耗電，所以投資電廠很划算，當產能利用率高的時候可以自己用，淡季時可以支援民生用電。
持反對意見的台積電資深主管則認為，「台積電的本業是晶圓代工，太陽能電廠是業外，投資設立太陽能電廠會有不專注本業的問題；過去台積電也曾經投資太陽能和LED，結果卻在虧了一大筆錢之後退出市場，台積電也沒有經營電廠的經驗和人才，所以設電廠雖然討論多年，卻始終沒有實現。」


太陽能電廠是未來綠能發展的趨勢。（東方IC）

然而，就算台積電想蓋電廠，屏東縣政府也表態全力支持，「政府不能獨厚台積電！」一位太陽能電廠負責人說，「屏東台糖的林地早就有一堆太陽能電廠業者搶著要，依照規定，這些林地釋出應該要公開招標，台積電憑什麼要求政府獨厚他們？不能說你是台積電就有特權。」
「這些林地要進行土地變更需要至少2、3年的時間，種鳳梨的農地要變成農電共生，要通過環境影響評估，成功的機率更低，台積電用錢不見得可以拿到土地。台積電需要綠電，何必自己跳下來蓋電廠，我們太陽能電廠發電賣給他就好了，喝牛奶何必養一頭牛？」太陽能電廠異口同聲說。


劉德音上任以來，帶領台積電衝刺，市值頻創歷史新高紀錄。

台積電在面對蓋太陽能電廠一事，態度也顯得相當謹慎。「台積電無法評論屏東建置太陽能電廠一事。」台積電代理發言人孫又文說，「台積電樂見台灣有更多綠電，並會與綠電廠商及政府合作，加速推動綠電，只是計畫要怎麼落實，有待許多條件配合。」
台積電以半導體龍頭之姿蓋太陽能電廠，未演先轟動，引起業界和社會關注，但未來要如何兼顧地方發展、環保意識和台積電的布局，將是政府和劉德音的考驗。


台積電曾經投資太陽能廠茂迪，但在2016年認賠賣掉持股。

[Full Text] Liu Deyin's rainy day, TSMC 60 billion Pingtung Solar Power Plant
02 Nov 2019, 23:28 by Chen Zhongxing, Dong Menghang, Wang Junfeng, Lin Yuwei
On October 17, TSMC will hand over a bright transcript in the law, so that the legal person institution is very satisfied, and continue to increase the holdings of the shares. The foreign capital has also raised the target price of TSMC to more than 300 yuan, which makes the market value of TSMC hit a record. new highs.
However, Liu Deyin, who has been the chairman of TSMC for more than a year, has a long-term view. Due to the large power consumption of the new TSMC 3nm plant and the green power demanded by Apple and other clients, he plans to spend 60 billion yuan. The largest solar power plant in Taiwan was built in Pingtung and once again entered the solar industry.



Last Wednesday (October 23rd), Pingtung County’s “Linhou Silinpingdi Forest Park” was shining brightly. Standing in the park, you can still feel the hotness of 30 degrees. The densely-leaved eucalyptus forest in the park seems to be Did not play too much cooling effect.


The Linlin Silinpingdi Forest Park in the Chaozhou Town of Pingtung Township is a Taiwan Sugar Land, and it is also one of the popular destinations for the Taiji Power Plant.

Pingtung's daily average sunshine can reach 6.16 hours, which is conducive to the development of solar power plants. In the future, this sparsely populated forest land may be razed to the ground, and the green forest in front of it will become a piece of blue solar panel, because TSMC plans 砸60 billion yuan in Pingtung Gai Solar Power Plant, which is one of the hot list of scheduled places.
The reporter asked the staff about the rumors that the forest park might become a power plant. The other party replied: ""I heard, but I don't know where the exact location of the power plant will be."" Further inquiring about how to deal with so many trees if a solar power plant is set up? The staff said: ""May be cut a lot.""


Liu Deyin (left) took the stick from the founder of TSMC, Zhang Zhongmou (right), and lived up to expectations to produce beautiful transcripts.

Age: 66 years old
Education: Doctor of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, USA
Experience: Senior Deputy General Manager of Chartered Semiconductor, CEO of TSMC
Present post: Chairman of TSMC



Performance climbs into a power-eater monster
On July 11, TSMC publicly stated in the EIA meeting that in order to meet the government's goal of adopting 20% green power, it is negotiating cooperation with Pingtung County Government and hopes to lead the development of large-scale solar power plants. Pingtung County Government also confirmed that TSMC initially locked Pingtung Taiwan Sugar Land as a power plant base. The power plant scale capacity reached 1.23 million kilowatts, equivalent to the scale of the decommissioned nuclear plant, generating 1.5 billion kWh, and an estimated 1,200 hectares of land. After TSMC proposed the concept and location, it hoped that through the coordination of the Inter-Ministry of the China Development Association, the land acquisition would be smoother.
If the construction cost of 50 million yuan per hectare is estimated, TSMC will invest more than 60 billion yuan. This is the largest investment in the field of foundry since the chairman of TSMC, Liu Deyin, took over in June last year.


The semiconductor process is very power-hungry, and TSMC is therefore in a hurry for power demand. (provided by TSMC)

Liu Deyin has handed over a beautiful transcript for more than a year. As TSMC's wafer technology in the advanced process of 7nm has gained a dominant position in the market, the sales volume of Apple's iPhone 11 is also better than expected. The market value of TSMC has set a record high. On October 16, the stock price once again hit 298 yuan. High point. Zhang Zhongmou, founder of TSMC, is expected to attend the sports meeting held on November 2nd to express his recognition of the new team's business performance.
On the occasion of leading the TSMC's performance to a peak, Liu Deyin did not dare to relax. He planned the future layout of TSMC in green energy. Why is TSMC, which is the global semiconductor bull, to step into green energy and build a large power plant?


The new plant of 5 nanometers to be mass-produced by TSMC in the first quarter of next year will use more electricity than East Taiwan, which has a population of 560,000. (Special Photography Lin Weiyan)

TSMC used 13 billion kWh of electricity last year, but it is only 5 nanometers to be mass-produced in the first quarter of next year. The electricity consumption is even larger than the electricity consumption of 560,000 people in East Taiwan. Nano is expected to be mass-produced in 2022. The annual electricity consumption is as high as 7.7 billion kWh, which is equivalent to 59.23% of total electricity consumption of TSMC last year. It exceeds the annual livelihood and commercial electricity consumption of Tainan City. Taiwan 3%, the growth rate is like eating monsters.

To secure the order, re-enter the solar energy
Wu Mingquan, convener of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Association Academic Committee, said that Apple and Google have gradually used 100% of green power, and also asked suppliers such as TSMC to use green power. In the past, TSMC bought green certificates from abroad. At this stage, the company first Efforts to reach the goal of 20% green power, and gradually follow Apple's footsteps to 100%, but if the future green power is still not enough, TSMC will face the risk of not being able to take orders.
In addition, the Ministry of Economic Affairs ""Regulations on the Renewable Energy Development"" also requires large power consumers such as TSMC to use green power or purchase green power in a certain proportion of the actual annual electricity consumption. It is imperative to use the green potential. Liu Deyin therefore Actively evaluate and develop solar power plants, and Pingtung, the southernmost and the longest sunshine in Taiwan, is the ideal location for cover factories.


At present, Taiwan's largest solar power plant is Zhangbin Optoelectronics of Taipower. In the future, TSMC's solar power plant will generate 12.3 times more power than Zhangbin Optoelectronics. (turning over the Taiwanese official website)

If TSMC’s plan for the Pingtung Power Plant is completed, it will become Taiwan’s largest solar power plant. At present, Taiwan's largest solar power plant is Zhangbin Optoelectronics of Taipower, with a capacity of 100,000 kilowatts. It is estimated that the seven-story Yantian in Tainan will be 150,000 kilowatts. If the TSMC Pingtung Solar Power Plant is completed, the power generation will be Zhangbin Optoelectronics. 12.3 times.
However, the gap with competitors is getting farther and farther away. TSMC, which has taken the lead in the field of foundry, has entered the layout of solar power plants, but faces challenges and opposition from all walks of life.

Shovel flat park
Chen Renda, the founding chairman of the Taiwan Smart Green Energy Industry Alliance, said bluntly: ""After many investigations, Taiwan Sugar will cut off more than 100,000 trees in the forest park of Linhou Silinpingdi, Chaozhou Town, in order to supply land to TSMC."" TSMC ""Become a ""cut tree shop""? If you cut a dozen or so million trees, you should be famous all over the world.""


The sugar land of Pingtung may become a land for solar power plants. In the future, this forest may become a piece of solar energy.

Chen Renta even published a public comment on Facebook. ""After Zhang Zhongmou retired, TSMC changed and decided to invest in power generation. On the one hand, it can save a lot of electricity bills. On the other hand, it also said that it supports environmental protection. However, TSMC may not find out that this The decision may make you fall into a big pit.""
""Taiwan does not lack electricity. The lack of green power!"" said Wu Mingquan, the convener of the Academic Committee of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Alliance. ""Green power is a national security issue. We support TSMC to cover solar power plants, but they must first pass the EIA.""

Landlord Taiwan Sugar receives 3 billion
""Taiwan's trees in Pingtung are man-made forests. These trees cannot be cut, but they must solve the problem of tree-protection groups."" People familiar with the matter said that in 2015, when TSMC Zhongke Factory expanded its factory, it used to be a tree-protecting group and environmental protection. The resistance of the group has been plagued for a long time. Therefore, although Taiwan Sugar is willing to cooperate with the policy to help Taiwan Semiconductor Industry find land, it is hoped that the tree will be cut by TSMC.


When TSMC expanded its fab in Zhongke, it was protested by environmental groups because large trees were removed. (Revolving Taiwan Ecological Society)

According to our survey, in addition to Chaozhou Town, the forest land of Xinyi Township and the surrounding blocks of Taiwan Sugar Changlong Farm in the north of Shuxiang Township are also considered to be potential sites for TSMC solar power plants. For these remote forest land and agricultural land, it may become a solar power plant. The opinions of local people are two poles.
Zhou Pinquan, the mayor of Chaozhou, said: ""If you want to cut down the existing trees, it is not appropriate. You should consider it again."" However, the director of the Xinyi Township Office believes that setting up a solar power plant is good, not only can prosper the economy, but also drive the employed population. It is also possible to make effective use of the land. The development of Chaozhou Town has been good in recent years, the population has a net inflow situation, and Xinyi Township is a net outflow, so the position is not the same.
If Taiwan Sugar's large area of idle land in Pingtung is successfully converted into a solar power plant, it can solve the problem of TSMC's lack of electricity. Taiwan Sugar can also increase a large amount of income. The annual rent of 100 hectares is 100 million yuan. If Taiwan Sugar is in the woodland of Pingtung County, 3,000 hectares, equivalent to a treasury can increase income by 3 billion yuan a year.
In addition to differences in views on cutting trees, TSMC has different opinions on the construction of solar power plants.


In the past few years, the front desk of the company has expanded its factory, and it has been involved in rare trees and dog peppers. (turning over the Dadushan Society)


Zhongke felling tree controversy TSMC transferred to Tainan
In 2015, TSMC originally planned to expand a large-scale fab in Zhongke. However, after the environmental impact assessment, local tree-protection groups found that Zhongke had begun to complete the land preparation and large-scale trees were removed. There were hundreds of women and children at that time. The main people went to the Taichung City Government and the construction site to protest.
The environmental protection group believes that the new TSMC plant is about 53 hectares and needs to cut 150,000 trees, which may lead to deterioration of air quality. At that time, there were less than 1,000 rare tree species of dog peppers in the whole Taiwan, of which more than 90% were distributed in Dadu Mountain. Become an issue of concern to the outside world.
As TSMC's Zhongke expansion plant was smashed by tree-protecting groups and environmental groups, Lin Jialong, the mayor of the front desk, was even ridiculed as ""the mayor of the tree-cutting tree"". Later, the site of the new plant of 5 nanometers and 3 nanometers of TSMC was excluded from Taichung. Go to Tainan.


Power plant dissatisfaction
The pro-party believes that TSMC’s factory is to maintain a clean room and has not yet produced it. It needs more than 6 billion yuan in electricity bills a year. The new EUV (extreme ultraviolet light) process consumes more electricity, so investing in power plants is cost-effective. When the capacity utilization rate is high, you can use it yourself. In the off-season, you can support people's livelihood.
The TSMC senior executives who disagree with it believe that ""the TSMC industry is a foundry, and the solar power plant is out of business. The investment in setting up a solar power plant will not focus on the industry. In the past, TSMC also invested in solar energy and LEDs. After losing a large sum of money and exiting the market, TSMC did not have the experience and talents to operate the power plant. Therefore, although the power plant has been discussed for many years, it has never been realized.""


Solar power plants are the future trend of green energy development. (Oriental IC)

However, even if TSMC wants to build a power plant, the Pingtung County government has expressed its full support. ""The government can't make a TSMC!"" said a person in charge of a solar power plant. ""The forest land of Pingtung Taiwan Sugar has long been rushing for a bunch of solar power plants. According to the regulations, these forest land release should be open to public bidding. Why does TSMC ask the government to be unique to them? It cannot be said that you have the privilege of TSMC.""
""It takes at least two or three years for these forest land to change land. The agricultural land that grows pineapple should become a symbiosis of agricultural power. It is necessary to pass the environmental impact assessment, and the probability of success is lower. TSMC does not have the money to get the land. TSMC needs Green power, why bother to jump down to cover the power plant, we solar power plant to sell him to sell just fine, why do you have to raise a cow when drinking milk?"" Solar power plant said in unison.


Since taking office, Liu Deyin has led TSMC to sprint, and the market value has set a record high.

TSMC is also very cautious in its face of facing the solar power plant. ""TSMC can't comment on the construction of a solar power plant in Pingtung."" Taiwan's ICBC spokesman Sun Youwen said, ""Taiwan has seen more green power in Taiwan and will work with green power manufacturers and the government to accelerate the promotion of green power. How to implement it, there are many conditions to be met.""
TSMC has covered the solar power plant with the faucet of semiconductors. It has not made a sensation, which has aroused the attention of the industry and the society. However, how to balance local development, environmental awareness and the layout of TSMC in the future will be the test of the government and Liu Deyin.


TSMC once invested in the solar power plant Modi, but in 2016 it pledges to sell its shares.
