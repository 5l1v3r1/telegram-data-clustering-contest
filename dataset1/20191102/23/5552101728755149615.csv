02 Nov 2019, 23:28 by 傅崇琛, 鄒保祥, 姜永年
台灣男子李冠億2015年利用藝人周杰倫準備在上海投資健身房的名義，向大陸裝潢包商借款新台幣800萬元後人間蒸發，害包商留下遺書失聯，包商母2度自殺未遂，鬧上媒體版面。銷聲匿跡多年後，李最近重出江湖，他在台灣教會搭上藝能界人士，拿著與藝人浩子、曹格等人的合照，以投資、代購商品的名義在兩岸招搖撞騙，詐騙金額至少新台幣5千萬元，在演藝圈掀起風暴。離譜的是，李遭控詐欺被通緝，卻能自由出入境，被害人要求司法單位給個交代！



「當時的新聞只有名字沒有照片，可能很多人不知道他在搞詐欺，才會一直有人被騙！」旗下擁有多位知名藝人的經紀人Ｘ先生，拿出手機秀出當年與李冠億有關的新聞連結，氣憤地說。

混入教會中　私訊攀關係
Ｘ先生同時也提供李冠億與多名藝人的合照，除了先前已曝光過的周杰倫，包括「浩角翔起」的浩子、曹格、孫耀威、「小胖」林育羣、方泂鑌等人，都曾與李狀似熟稔地勾肩搭手，甚至親密靠頭，合照場景除了一般宴會場合之外，似乎還有演唱會後台、包廂及住家。

「就是因為這些照片，加上我認識他的過程，讓我誤信他的說詞，沒想到最後才知道根本是一場騙局！」Ｘ先生表示，他是2、3年前在「新生命教會」認識李冠億，國內許多藝人都是該教會的教友，常常會在此做禮拜。
Ｘ先生回憶說：「教會的活動其實有分藝人組跟其他組，也不知道為什麼他能夠混到藝人組這邊來。演藝圈的幕前、幕後人員只要去完教會，常會聚在一起吃飯聊天，順便幫彼此禱告。」


李冠億加入藝人教友眾多的新生命教會（圖），結識了許多藝能界人士。

「當時我比較常跟藝人劉畊宏、陳楚河等人一起吃飯，李冠億也跟著我們聚過幾次，但我對這個人其實沒什麼印象。去年初，他突然用臉書私訊我，我當下想不起這人是誰，他主動提起與畊宏、楚河吃飯的事，我一聽是教會的教友就放下心防，我想教會的人應該都很單純，沒想到卻遇到魔鬼！」X先生提起認識李的過程，情緒仍舊忿忿不平。
　
約吃飯鋪路　混熟後借錢


X先生（圖）秀出手機內的受害者群組表示，李冠億在兩岸到處騙錢，甚至有大陸受害人被騙了人民幣800萬元（約新台幣3400多萬元）。

一開始，李冠億只是向Ｘ先生噓寒問暖，說自己在上海的健身房當總監，因為知道X先生也常到大陸工作，所以約他有空一起吃飯。過了一陣子，Ｘ先生到大陸工作，李也真的作東約吃飯，還帶了一些當地有頭有臉的人來。後來李冠億失聯，Ｘ先生向其他人聯絡詢問之後，才發現李是想藉由介紹這些朋友，讓大家覺得他很「靠譜」，為日後的詐騙行為鋪路。
在大陸吃過一、二次飯後，李冠億有次忽然私訊Ｘ先生，說他在上海一間百貨公司承租櫃位，要投資開拉麵店，當時X先生還對他說：「很好啊！恭喜你啊！」結果李話鋒一轉，說因為有股東撤資，必須要想辦法補足資金缺口。
Ｘ先生告訴本刊：「我聽到他這樣講時，以為他是要找我當股東，結果是要向我借錢。一開始我不想借他，但他一直裝可憐，說少了這筆資金的話，簽約時的斡旋金就會被沒收。」


X先生出面揭露李冠億的惡行，希望不要再有其他人受害。

後來X先生勉為其難答應借給李冠億人民幣5萬元（約合新台幣21萬5千元），當天就匯款給李指定的台灣帳戶，不料，隔天李又藉口說大陸那邊又有股東撤資，要補的資金缺口更大，想要再借人民幣2、30萬元救急，X先生當下表示不可能，但李死纏爛打，Ｘ先生不忍他一直「求爺爺告奶奶」，又心軟答應借他人民幣10萬元（約合新台幣43萬元）。
「李冠億宣稱跟很多藝人是好朋友，我又看過他們的合照，想說他應該所言不虛，不然怎麼可能會跟這些人一起去唱歌、喝酒？加上他又的確認識大陸一些有力人士，所以我對他健身房總監的身分也沒懷疑，就用手機支付寶轉了人民幣10萬元給他。」Ｘ先生表示。
李冠億在借錢當下，一再承諾過2天就還錢，不料，幾週後突然失聯。Ｘ先生想盡辦法向所有認識李的人打聽消息，最後問到李上班的健身房，健身房竟回覆說，李因在當地吸毒、打架，被公安抓進拘留所，整個人就這樣消失，連公司都找不到他，Ｘ先生這時才驚覺錢可能已遭李設計騙走。
　
周杰倫好友　同手法受騙
Ｘ先生想到李冠億曾說認識周杰倫，因此又透過演藝圈人脈詢問周的朋友，直到「大魔王」告知Ｘ先生，說李是個騙子，自己幾年前也曾被他用同樣的手法騙錢，還上了媒體，Ｘ先生才趕緊上網搜尋相關新聞。


X先生轉述，「大魔王」許家豪談到當年李冠億欠錢落跑，仍氣憤難耐。（翻攝自飆捍臉書）

Ｘ先生口中的大魔王，正是周杰倫的保鑣兼好友，同時也是健身教練的許家豪，由於許家豪曾在綜藝節目擔任闖關魔王的角色，因此被戲稱為大魔王，曾經與昔日豔星小龍女交往過，目前則是「300壯士」健身房執行長。
本刊調查，2015年1月，周杰倫與妻子昆凌舉行世紀婚禮前夕，就曾經有讀者向媒體爆料，說許家豪打著周的旗號，透過李冠億用300壯士將在上海拓點為藉口，向一名石姓裝潢承包商周轉人民幣近200萬元。李當時以「未來工程都給你承包」等說詞，從2014年6月開始，陸續向石借了人民幣185萬元（約合新台幣800萬元），原本說好一個月後歸還，卻拖了半年仍未還。
石姓承包商因李冠億聲稱是周杰倫友人，加上大陸官方正推廣「全民健身」政策，健身風氣盛行，為了日後能繼續承包周的其他健身房工程，除了把自己的錢借給李，甚至還向地下錢莊借錢給對方，且因其中人民幣80萬元（約合新台幣345萬元）是大魔王許家豪代購器材的費用，所以直接匯到許的帳戶，結果反讓許蒙受不白之冤。
由於李冠億賴帳不還，導致石姓包商被地下錢莊暴力討債，2014年底，石留下遺書後離家、音訊全無，地下錢莊轉向石的家人追討債務，石母因不堪其擾，二度到上海明天廣場的300壯士健身房預定地求助，要求李出面，甚至直接上頂樓企圖跳樓自殺。


李冠億曾利用周杰倫（圖）的名義，在上海跟包商借了近人民幣200萬元，包商之母為此二度尋死。

2014年跨年夜，石母又在家中喝農藥自殺，幸好附近鄰居發現得早，及時送醫救回一命。不論石家人如何以死相逼，李冠億卻從頭到尾都神隱無蹤，當時周杰倫所屬的公司回應表示：「周杰倫完全不知情。」許家豪則說那是李個人的債務問題，與健身房無關。
Ｘ先生轉述：「大魔王提到李冠億還是氣得要死，當年李向大魔王誇稱大陸人脈很廣，又長期在當地從事健身事業，開設健身房所需的資金、器材都可幫忙處理，大魔王認為大家都是台灣人，人不親土親，才答應讓李加盟，沒想到李竟用周杰倫的名義騙錢，健身房根本沒開成，還把事情鬧成這樣！」

健身房業務　詐會員千萬
X先生一一詢問身邊友人之後，發現很多人也被李冠億詐騙，李除了會利用投資名義向朋友調頭寸「挖東牆補西牆」，也會向友人表示，因與藝人熟稔，可以代買熱門演唱會門票，甚至利用在精品記者會上與藝人的合照，宣稱可以拿到便宜的精品包、飾品等理由，向大家騙錢。
李冠億詐騙對象之廣，除了演藝圈人士，連他當時介紹給X先生認識的一名大陸融資公司老闆也受騙上當，後來該名老闆與Ｘ先生用通訊軟體拉了一個受害人群組，成員多達十數人，包括李上班的健身房會員也在其中，有會員表示李根本就不是總監，只是小業務員。

由於健身房許多會員都被李冠億詐騙，金額從人民幣數萬至800萬元（約新台幣3400多萬元），最後連健身房老闆都撇清與李的關係，甚至提供李的台胞證給受害群組成員，要他們直接提告。更有女會員在群組表示，李除了騙錢，還利用健身房的會員資料騷擾、要女會員出門陪玩，甚至偷女會員的照片發IG，營造自己很吃得開的形象。

在台被通緝　大方出入境
Ｘ先生表示：「李冠億最厲害的是，他跟你佯稱投資失利需要周轉的時候，都拿得出『正本合約書』來證明，博取你的信任，事實上，這些生意跟他一點關係都沒有。但更讓我無法接受的是，台灣的司法單位竟能讓一個被通緝的人，在海關出出入入，發布通緝到底有什麼意義？」
原來Ｘ先生去年3月借錢給李冠億，等了半年李仍不還錢，只好向法院提告，李因屢傳不到遭法院通緝。沒想到，Ｘ先生輾轉聯繫上李的大陸前女友，對方竟告知，李被通緝後，還曾帶她回到台灣，大大方方進入海關，且到處遊山玩水，原來是李自己跑到法院報到，才解除當時的通緝身分。



X先生控告李冠億詐欺，李目前已遭地檢署起訴、通緝。（讀者提供）

Ｘ先生揮舞著手中資料表示：「李冠億真的很惡劣，甚至還拿借來的錢去錢莊放款，他曾跟我說，正在大陸進行『洗錢』工作，賺到錢就還我，簡直離譜至極！這一次李不但被檢察官起訴，而且再次遭到通緝，我只希望台灣海關不要再讓他來去自如，也要提醒大家注意，不要再有人被騙了！」

[Full Text] Jay Chou, Cao Ge, and Hao Zi are being used by the art world.
02 Nov 2019, 23:28 by Fu Chongxi, Zou Baoxiang, Jiang Yongnian
In 2015, Taiwanese man Li Guanyi used the artist Jay Chou to prepare to invest in the gym in Shanghai. After borrowing NT$8 million from the mainland decoration contractor, the humans evaporated, and the contractor left the suicide note, and the merchant’s mother attempted suicide twice. Make a noise on the media layout. After many years of disappearing, Li recently re-emerged in the rivers and lakes. He took a group of artists in the Taiwanese church, took photos with artists Hao Zi, Cao Ge and others, and swindled and swindled on both sides in the name of investment and purchasing goods. The amount of fraud was at least NT$5,000. Ten thousand yuan, set off a storm in the entertainment industry. It is outrageous that Li was accused of fraud and wanted to go abroad, but the victim asked the judicial unit to give an account!



""The news at the time was that there was no photo in the name. Many people may not know that he is defrauding, and everyone will be deceived!"" Mr. X, a broker with a number of well-known artists, took out his mobile phone and showed up with Li Guanyi. The news link, said angrily.



Li Guanyi used photos with Jay Chou, Cao Ge (right), and Hao Zi to declare that he was a good friend of the artist. After gaining the trust of the victim, he took the opportunity to swindle. (provided by the reader)

Mixed into the church
Mr. X also provided a photo of Li Guanyi and a number of artists, in addition to the previously exposed Jay Chou, including Hao Zi, Cao Ge, Sun Yaowei, ""Little Fat"", Lin Yuqun, Fang Wei, etc. Li likes to be familiar with his shoulders, even close to the head, in addition to the general banquet scene, there seems to be a concert backstage, box and home.



Artists such as Lin Yuqun, Sun Yaowei (middle) and Fang Wei have been framed with Li Guanyi, and they have been used by Li for fraud. (provided by the reader)

Li Guanyi also took photos with well-known singer Zhang Zhicheng (left). (provided by the reader)


""It is because of these photos, plus the process I know him, that I mistakenly believe his words. I didn't expect to know that it was a scam at the end!"" Mr. X said that he was in the ""New Life Church"" two or three years ago. Knowing Li Guanyi, many domestic artists are members of the church and often pray here.
Mr. X recalled: ""The activities of the church actually belong to the artist group and other groups, and I don't know why he can mix it with the artist group. The front and behind-the-scenes personnel of the entertainment circle just go to the church and often gather together to eat. Chat, by the way, help each other.""


Li Guanyi joined the many new life churches (pictures) of artists and friends, and met many people in the art world.

""At the time, I often had dinner with artists Liu Genghong and Chen Chuhe. Li Guanyi also followed us a few times, but I didn't really have any impression of this person. At the beginning of last year, he suddenly used Facebook to send me a message, I think now. I can't afford this person. He took the initiative to mention the things to eat with Genghong and Chuhe. When I heard that the church members were down, I thought that the people in the church should be very simple. I didn't expect to encounter the devil! Mr. X mentioned the process of knowing Li, and his emotions are still uneven.

About to eat and pave the way to borrow money after mixing


Mr. X (pictured) showed the victim group in the mobile phone that Li Guanyi was cheating on both sides of the strait, and even mainland victims were defrauded of RMB 8 million (about NT$ 34 million).

At the beginning, Li Guanyi just asked Mr. X to talk about his coldness and said that he was the director of the gym in Shanghai. Because he knew that Mr. X also often went to work in the mainland, he asked him to have dinner together. After a while, Mr. X went to work in the mainland. Li also really made dinner for the East, and brought some local people with faces. Later, Li Guanyi lost contact. After Mr. X contacted other people, he found out that Li wanted to introduce these friends and let everyone think that he was ""reliable"" and paved the way for future fraud.
After eating one or two meals in the mainland, Li Guanyi suddenly had a private message, Mr. X, saying that he was renting a counter in a department store in Shanghai and wanted to invest in the ramen shop. At that time, Mr. X also said to him: Okay! Congratulations!"" As a result, Li Yuanfeng turned around and said that because of the withdrawal of shareholders, it is necessary to find ways to make up the funding gap.
Mr. X told this magazine: ""I heard him say this when he thought he was looking for me to be a shareholder. The result was to borrow money from me. I didn't want to borrow him at the beginning, but he always kept pity and said that he had lost the money. If you sign the contract, the mediation will be forfeited.""


Mr. X came forward to expose Li Guanyi’s evil deeds, hoping that no one else would suffer.

Later, Mr. X replied that it was difficult to lend Li Guanyi RMB 50,000 (about NT$215,000). On the same day, he remitted money to Li’s designated Taiwan account. Unexpectedly, the next day, Li also excused that there were shareholders on the mainland. Withdrawal of funds, the gap to be replenished is even bigger. I want to borrow RMB 2,300,000 to save the emergency. Mr. X said that it is impossible, but Lee is stalking, and Mr. X cannot bear to have been ""seeking grandfather to tell his grandmother"" and is soft. I promised to borrow him RMB 100,000 (about NT$430,000).
""Li Guanyi claims to be a good friend with many artists. I have seen their photos together. I want to say that he should be vocal. Otherwise, how can he sing and drink with these people? Plus he confirms that the mainland is strong. People, so I have no doubt about the identity of his gym director, he used mobile phone Alipay to transfer him 100,000 yuan."" Mr. X said.
At the moment of borrowing money, Li Guanyi repeatedly promised to pay back the money in two days. Unexpectedly, he suddenly lost his connection after a few weeks. Mr. X tried his best to inquire about the news from all the people who knew Li. Finally, he asked Li to go to the gym. The gym actually replied that Li was taking drugs and fighting in the local area and was arrested by the police. The whole person disappeared, even the company. Can not find him, Mr. X then realized that the money may have been cheated by Lee.

Jay Chou’s friends were deceived by the same method.
Mr. X thought that Li Guanyi once said that he knew Jay Chou, so he asked Zhou’s friends through the entertainment circle, until the “Great Devil” told Mr. X that Li was a liar and that he had used the same method to defraud money a few years ago. And also on the media, Mr. X quickly rushed to the Internet to search for relevant news.


Mr. X said that Xu Jiahao, the ""big devil"", said that Li Guanyi was owed money and was still angry. (Reflected from the face book)

The big devil in Mr. X’s mouth is Jay Chou’s friend and friend, and also a fitness instructor’s Xu Jiahao. Because Xu Jiahao once played the role of Shaoguan Demon in the variety show, he was dubbed the Great Devil and once interacted with the old Yanlong Little Dragon Girl. At present, he is currently the CEO of the ""300 Strongman"" gym.
According to our survey, in January 2015, Jay Chou and his wife Kun Ling held a wedding on the eve of the century. Some readers broke the news to the media, saying that Xu Jiahao was playing the banner of Zhou, and using Li Guanyi to use 300 strong men to make an excuse in Shanghai. To a stone surname decoration contractor turnover of nearly 2 million yuan. At that time, Li said that ""the future projects are all contracted to you"". Since June 2014, he has borrowed RMB 1.85 million (about NT$ 8 million) from the stone. It was originally said that it will be returned after one month, but It has not been returned for half a year.
The stone surname contractor claimed to be a friend of Jay Chou by Li Guanyi, and the mainland official is promoting the ""National Fitness"" policy. The fitness trend is prevalent, in order to continue to contract other gym projects in the future, in addition to lending their money to Li, even I also borrowed money from the underground money house, and because of the RMB 800,000 (about NT$ 3.45 million), it was the cost of purchasing equipment for the big devil Xu Jiahao, so I directly remitted it to Xu’s account, and the result was that Xu was not accepting it. injustice.
Because Li Guanyi’s account was not repaid, the stone surname merchants were violently debunked by underground money houses. At the end of 2014, after leaving the posthumous notes, Shi left home and had no audio. The underground money house turned to Shi’s family to recover debts. The stone mother was unbearable. Disturbed, the second time to the Shanghai 300 squares gymnasium in Tomorrow Square, scheduled to ask for help, asked Li to face, and even went directly to the top floor to attempt to commit suicide.


Li Guanyi used the name of Jay Chou (picture) to borrow nearly RMB 2 million from the contractor in Shanghai. The mother of the merchants was second to death.

In the New Year's Eve in 2014, Shi Mu also committed suicide by drinking pesticides at home. Fortunately, the neighbors found it early and sent the doctor back to life. Regardless of how the Shi family was forced to die, Li Guanyi was gone from beginning to end. At that time, Jay Chou’s company responded by saying: “Jay Jay is completely ignorant.” Xu Jiahao said that it was Li’s personal debt problem and had nothing to do with the gym. .
Mr. X said: ""The big devil mentioned that Li Guanyi was still angry. In the past, Li Xiangda devil praised that the mainland has a wide network of contacts, and he has been engaged in fitness for a long time. The funds and equipment needed to open a gym can help. The big devil thinks that everyone is a Taiwanese. When people don't kiss each other, they promised to let Li join. I didn't expect Li Jing to use the name of Jay Chou to swindle the money. The gym didn't even start, and it made things like this!""


The 300 Strong Fitness Club is quite large, and Xu Jiahao is currently the CEO. (Revolving Cross-Time Fitness Center - 300 Strongman Club Facebook)


Gym business
After asking Mr. Friends one by one, Mr. X found that many people were also defrauded by Li Guanyi. In addition to using the investment name, Li will adjust his position to the friend to ""dig the east wall to make up the Western Wall"". He will also tell the friends that because they are familiar with the artist, they can Buying popular concert tickets, and even taking photos with artists at the boutique press conference, claiming that you can get cheap boutique bags, accessories and other reasons, to lie to everyone.
Li Guanyi’s wide range of scams, in addition to the entertainment industry, even the boss of a mainland financing company he introduced to Mr. X was also deceived. Later, the boss and Mr. X used a communication software to pull a victim group. There are more than a dozen members, including the gym members who Li went to work. Some members said that Li is not a director at all, just a small salesman.



Li Guanyi asked if anyone wanted to sell bitcoin? Emphasizing that it is necessary to pay off the debts, Mr. X said that he would not help introduce, and asked Li to pay back the money. (provided by the reader)

Mr. X said that Li Guanyi owed money and did not appear, and claimed that he was engaged in illegal acts such as money laundering. (provided by the reader)


As many members of the gym have been defrauded by Li Guanyi, the amount is from tens of thousands to 8 million yuan (about NT$34 million). Finally, even the gym bosses have cleared the relationship with Li and even provided Li’s Taiwanese certificate. Members of the victim group are asked to report directly. More female members said in the group that in addition to swindling money, Lee also used the member information of the gym to harass, asked female members to go out to play, and even sneaked photos of female members to create an image that they could eat very well.


The 300 strong man fitness club used to write on Facebook and cut it with the swindler Li Guanyi. (Revolving Cross-Time Fitness Center - 300 Strongman Club Facebook)


Being wanted at the station
Mr. X said: ""The most powerful thing about Li Guanyi is that when he nicknamed you that the investment failure needs to be turned around, you can get the ""original contract"" to prove that you trust your trust. In fact, these businesses are with him. There is no relationship. But what makes me unacceptable is that Taiwan’s judicial unit can make it possible for a wanted person to enter and leave at the customs.
It turned out that Mr. X borrowed money from Li Guanyi in March last year. After waiting for half a year, Li still did not pay back the money. He had to confess to the court that Li was unable to pass the court wanted. Unexpectedly, Mr. X tweeted to contact Li’s ex-girlfriend in mainland China. The other party actually told Li that after he was wanted, he also took her back to Taiwan. He went to the customs and went to the mountains to play with water. It turned out that Li himself went to the court. When I reported, I was relieved of my overnight identity.



Mr. X sued Li Guanyi for fraud, and Li has been sued and wanted by the local inspection department. (provided by the reader)

Mr. X waved his hand and said: ""Li Guanyi is really bad. He even used the borrowed money to go to the bank to lend money. He told me that he is doing money laundering work on the mainland. If he makes money, he will pay me back. This is extremely ridiculous! This time Li was not only prosecuted by the prosecutor, but also wanted again, I only hope that Taiwan Customs will not let him come and go, but also remind everyone to pay attention, no one is deceived!""
