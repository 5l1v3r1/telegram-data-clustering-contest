      <h1>The inside story on why Plymouth Argyle's home game against Grimsby Town was postponed</h1>
      <h2>A section of roofing in the Barn Park End at Home Park became loose after overnight gales</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T15:04:13+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 15:04</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Plymouth Argyle head of operations Jon Back has said there was no other option but to postpone the League Two game against Grimsby Town at Home Park this afternoon.</p>
      <p>The decision was taken on safety grounds after a section of roof at the Barn Park End became loose following severe winds overnight.</p>
      <p>The game was called off at around 12.30pm so many Grimsby supporters had either completed their trips to Plymouth or were well on the way to doing so.</p>
      <p>Many members of the Green Army had also arrived at Home Park for the fixture.</p>
      <p>So there was disappointment all round about the postponement but, as Back explained in an interview with Plymouth Live, it was an unavoidable decision.</p>
      <h3>There has been significant damage to the roof at the Barn Park End. What has happened?</h3>
      <p>Unfortunately, the stadium has been subject to some structural damage overnight. A roof section on the Barn Park End – so on the horseshoe side of the stadium – has come loose.</p>
      <p>We have been assessing with urgency this morning. We have brought in structural engineers from Plymouth City Council.</p>
      <p>They have looked at it and the assessment is that it’s unsafe.</p>
      <p>There is a likelihood that it will come off at some stage and, of course, given the blustery winds we can’t be certain of what direction that will go.</p>

      <p>We have been looking at repairs. Obviously, it’s in everybody’s interest for the game to go ahead today.</p>
      <p>It’s almost a disaster for the club when a game is postponed but with the strong winds that we are still experiencing, and which are forecast until beyond five o’clock tonight, legally we can’t work at those heights.</p>
      <p>On one hand it’s a difficult decision to postpone the game, but on the other hand all of the factors and all of the expert opinion actually made it a relatively decision in that there was only one thing we could do.</p>
      <h3>Who had the final say?</h3>
      <p>There are effectively two parts to that. There is a safety element of it and then there is a Football League component of that.</p>
      <p>So the club safety officer in conjunction with building control from the council – who also sit on the Safery Advisory Group – make a decision about whether or not the stadium is safe to open.</p>
      <p>And then it’s the League’s decision as to whether or not the game goes ahead.</p>
      <p>Clearly, in practical terms, those two are the same decisions but from a governance point of view it’s those two separate factors that are considered.</p>
      <h3>What time would club staff have been at the ground this morning?</h3>
      <p>Our staff are on site from very early on a Saturday matchday. We have got people in the stadium from seven, eight o’clock.</p>
      <p>Certainly from that time we have been making frantic phone calls and speaking with experts from that early hour to try and assess the level and the nature of the damage, and of the opportunities that we had to repair to get the game on.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, as soon as it became apparent that we were unable to do that we took the inevitable call that the game had to be postponed.</p>
      <h3>Grimsby’s supporters will have travelled a long way. Is there anything that could have been done to prevent this situation and them having to make a wasted trip?</h3>
      <p>The journey of the Grimsby fans was at the forefront of our thoughts and the Football League’s thoughts from the moment that we identified the damage.</p>
      <p>Of course, it’s a bit of a double-edged sword then. If we called the game off immediately there was a chance that we could have repaired the roof and continued the game.</p>
      <p>All of the Grimsby fans would have been en route to us by that time in any case because of the distances that they were travelling.</p>
      <p>In consultation with our local partners and with the Football League, we made sure we exhausted all opportunities to get the game on before we took the decision to postpone the game.</p>
      <p>Then we immediately contacted our friends at Grimsby to let them know so their fans could be turned around as soon as they can be.</p>

      <h3>So what happens now with the roof?</h3>
      <p>We can’t get up there until the wind dies down. We are told by the structural experts there is a strong possibility that section of the roof will come off in the next few hours.</p>
      <p>So an area behind the Barn Park End has also been cordoned off with help from the police and from the council.</p>
      <p>As soon as it’s safe for us to do so we will get up on the roof, assess the damage and repair it.</p>
      <h3>Is that a quick fix?</h3>
      <p>It is relatively. As we have seen from the construction of the new stand it’s cladding sheets that are bolted onto a main structure.</p>
      <p>From everything that we can see currently the main structure is unaffected. It’s bolts that have been sheared by the force of the wind and a single section of corrugated iron roofing.</p>
      <h3>The next league game at Home Park is not until November 23. Will the roof be repaired and safe by then?</h3>
      <p>I am certain that will be the case. As soon as the wind levels drop to allow us to get up there legally ans safely, we will be up there and we will fix it.</p>
      <h3>It’s such a blow for the club to lose a game so late in the day. All the plans have been made. All the food has been ordered. All the programmes have been delivered. It’s not a good situation for the club is it?</h3>
      <p>First and foremost, safety is the number one issue. Secondly to that, it is around the impact that it has on our fans and the travelling Grimsby fans.</p>
      <p>The club take quite a significant economic impact from games such as these being postponed.</p>
      <p>As you have said, there are a number of factors. We have got things being cooked, we have got concessions warming up pasties, we have had programmes printed.</p>
      <p>We have got hundreds of staff in the stadium already so the economic and financial impact on the club is significant.</p>
      <p>That’s why the decision is taken with a heavy heart but it’s the only decision that we could take.</p>
      <h3>Are you happy the club have done all they can to make sure the stadium has been properly maintained and structurally safe?</h3>
      <p>Yes, absolutely. There are a number of things we do to ensure that, some of which we do because we know it’s the right thing to do, some of which are part of the rules and regulations about running a public sports stadium.</p>
      <p>So every close season we have a forensically detailed structural survey of the stadium undertaken by qualified engineers.</p>
      <p>And then we put in a maintenance programme on the back of that. There were no issues identified with the roof.</p>
      <p>We also make a visual check of the stadium at 48 hours and 24 hours before every game and nothing was identified.</p>
      <p>Speaking with both the council and the police this morning the level of damage across Plymouth and the region has been huge.</p>
      <p>When I spoke to them two hours ago I think at least 50 trees had come down in the city and there were numerous reports of buildings and structures having been damaged.</p>
      <p>It’s dreadfully upsetting for us to have to postpone the game but it is one of those forces of nature that was just unavoidable.</p>
