      <p>Irish passengers have been left stranded in Krakow Airport in Poland after weather conditions forced Ryanair to cancel departing flights.</p>
      <p>Shannon and Dublin were among eight routes affected yesterday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Flights have been departing the airport today but some Ryanair passengers say they have been offered alternative flights as late as Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Róisín Ní Dhonnabhain, a teacher from Dublin, says she has had to make her own arrangements to get home.</p>
      <p>"Last night was absolute chaos," said Ms Ní Dhonnabhain.</p>
      <p>"We were put on a bus to Katowice, told that we would have a flight from there when our flight from Karkow was delayed.</p>
      <p>"Then we were 10 minutes from that airport when we were told that flight was cancelled.</p>
      <p>"They took us back down to Krakow to nothing really. Then we had to get our own way home."</p>
      <p>Reacting to the passengers comments this afternnon a spokesperson for Ryanair said the flight from Krakow to Dublin was regrettably cancelled due to weather at Krakow Airport.</p>
      <blockquote>"Affected customers were notified by email and SMS text message and advised of their options of a refund or free move to the next available flight. Ryanair sincerely apologised for this weather cancellation which was entirely beyond our control."</blockquote>
