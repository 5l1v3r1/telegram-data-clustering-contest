      <h1>The £1.3m Rightmove house leaving everybody on Twitter feeling 'ill' as pictures of inside go viral</h1>
      <h2>The £1.3 million home was shared by a Twitter user, and has set social media alight ever since the images surfaced</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T15:39:10+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 15:39</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, Luke Matthews, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>A five-bedroom detached home listed on Rightmove has left those viewing it "ill" - and you may feel the same after seeing these images.</p>
      <p>The property, which is situated in Middlesex, will set prospective house buyers back a hefty sum.</p>
      <p>The £1.3 million home was shared by a Twitter user, and has set social media alight ever since the images surfaced.</p>
      <p>Taking to the social media platform, Toby Davies wrote: "Thinking about buying this house, but I'm not sure it has enough plug sockets."</p>
      <p>You're probably wondering what he means - especially when you learn his tweet went viral, with more than 4,000 likes and 1,400 retweets.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/house-goes-sale-13m-photos-20794872">Mirror Online</a> reports as photos of the home move from the stunning exterior, to the dreamy kitchen and then to the living area, Toby's sarcastic concerns become very apparent.</p>
      <p>Every wall appears to be absolutely plastered in sockets. Sockets stacked on top of one another, sockets halfway up the walls and sockets running underneath the windows.</p>

      <p>With the owners clearly having never laid eyes on a multi-plug adapter, people were left completely baffled as to what all the outlets were possibly used for.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Questions include 'were they running the CIA from the front room?' and 'was this an electrician's training centre at one point?'.</p>

      <p>The online description fails to address quite why there are so many sockets.</p>
