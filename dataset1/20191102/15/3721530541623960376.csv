Obsidian Entertainment’s role-playing game bonafides are unquestioned. Still, it is charming to see in the credits of The Outer Worlds a tribute to all of the Dungeons & Dragons characters who died during development. All we gotta say is, John Cotto must be a tough dungeon master.
Cotto, a designer with Obsidian since 2016, ran a fifth-edition D&D campaign during development that took out five level 7 characters. They weren’t the only casualties; 3D artist Daniel Platt bagged a level 12 Barbarian Dragonborn in “At Death’s Door.”
When I was at summer camp 35 years ago, the roughest toughest DM was the archery instructor, Paul Chestnut, who was said to tear up players’ sheets if their character was slain. We had to be on our toes around him. Paul was a good guy, though. He concocted a big scenario where we destroyed an evil tome of magic and saved the realm right before the two-week stay was over. At the end, I don’t think he was even rolling dice behind the screen.
Anyway, Obsidian’s The Outer Worlds launched Oct. 25 on PlayStation 4, Windows PC and Xbox One. From the looks of our review, some seriously good DMs made it.
