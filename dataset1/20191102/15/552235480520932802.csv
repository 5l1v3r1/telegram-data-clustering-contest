Hopeful Porto boss Sergio Conceicao is confident striker Moussa Marega will be fit for Thursday’s Euro clash with Rangers . 
The Mali hitman shook off injury fears to feature in the 1-1 draw with Gers in Portugal a fortnight ago.
But he has sat out Porto 's last two league games and will be missing again on Sunday when Aves come calling.
However, gaffer Conceicao said: “We won’t lose Marega for long. There are physical limitations but it is nothing serious. It is a matter of days.”

The Europa League showdown at Ibrox will be key to Porto’s hopes of progressing but Conceicao is only thinking about the visit of Aves for now.
He said: “No coach in the world prepares two games at the same time. We will have the best 11 to win, depending on the strategy and the momentum of the players. We think only of this game, which is extremely important”
Group G is evenly poised with just three points separating the four teams after three rounds of matches. 
Steven Gerrard knows a victory over the Portuguese big-hitters will have his side in a strong position to reach the last 32.
