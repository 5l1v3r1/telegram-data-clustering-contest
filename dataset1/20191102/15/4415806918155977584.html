      <h1>Ashleigh Barty comes from behind to beat Karolina Pliskova at WTA Finals</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T15:48:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 15:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Top seed Ashleigh Barty recovered from a set down to beat Karolina Pliskova and book her place in the final of the WTA Finals in Shenzhen.</p>
      <p>Barty overcame second seed Pliskova 4-6 6-2 6-3 in one hour and 53 minutes to set up a final date with Elina Svitolina on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Australian had a patchy start, with Pliskova forcing seven break points in her first three service games.</p>
      <p>Pliskova was able to close out the first set after wasting several opportunities.</p>
      <p>But Barty – in the first meeting of the two highest-ranked players in the world since Caroline Wozniacki beat Simona Halep in the 2018 Australian Open final – dominated from that point to extend her lead to 4-2 in their rivalry.</p>
      <p>Svitolina, the number eight seed, was 4-1 ahead in the final set when Belinda Bencic retired due to cramping.</p>
      <p>The Ukrainian broke at the start of the second set and never again trailed from that point to win 5-7 6-3 4-1 .</p>
      <p>“It’s tough to play someone who has been injured, been injured on the court,” Svitolina told wtatennis.com.</p>
      <p>Bencic first gave cause for concern when she received a medical timeout while leading 6-5 in the opening set.</p>
      <p>“I started cramping in my foot and again in my hamstring,” Bencic said.</p>
      <p>“I really didn’t want to retire. I tried. Sometimes, I just tried to make a good serve, play no rallies. It just wasn’t enough.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to finish the match. It was not possible. I’m really disappointed about how my body failed me.”</p>
