      <p>Tries by wingers Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe closed the game out and sent Pretorians into overdrive. </p>

      <p>"The win made me ecstatic. For a moment I forgot about all the issues and just celebrated with fellow South Africans," he told News24. </p>
      <p>Matome Moloisi,28, said he knew South Africa would win, but wasn’t prepared for the celebrations afterwards. </p>
      <p>"I’m so happy, I can’t even express it.” </p>
      <p>Thando Gamnca, 34, said the win was a magical moment for all South Africans. </p>
      <p>"[Siya] Kolisi and everyone made the nation proud. Everyone was behind the boys and the spirit could be felt," Gamnca said. </p>
      <p>The celebrations spilled out of venues as many Pretorians took to the streets, people in cars hooting, people chanting as they walked on sidewalks was a common sight throughout eastern Pretoria.</p>
