England players' medal reaction has upset a lot of people on Twitter

The England team will understandably be bitterly disappointed after they fell to the Springboks in the World Cup final on Saturday, but many people do not think that justifies how they acted after.
Eddie Jones’ side were overwhelmed by South Africa 32-12 in Yokohama in a game where they were bullied up front. While they would have been distraught with the performance, fans on social media do not think that excuses them from refusing to wear their silver medals.
A number of players took the medals off as soon as they were awarded to them, an act that many fans think is a sign of poor sportsmanship.
Many have highlighted how the All Blacks reacted on Friday after receiving their bronze medals and have said that that is the example to follow, branding England as “sore losers”.
Of course, the bronze final was slightly different as, although they had come third, the All Blacks had just won their game against Wales. But many fans have emphasised that England still came second in the tournament, which is impressive in itself.
That will be little consolation to the players who were a far cry from the side that demolished the All Blacks the week before. This is what has been said:




































Going into the final, England were tipped as favourites by many, but there were very few moments where they challenged Rassie Erasmus’ side in the match. The Springboks were heroic in defence and were even stronger in the scrum.
Had England mounted more of a challenge, their reaction to losing – and receiving their medals – may have been different, but that still does not cut it for the fans.
