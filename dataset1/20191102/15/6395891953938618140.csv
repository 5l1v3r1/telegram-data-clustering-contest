CLEVELAND (AP) - Cleveland police say two people have been killed and another person has been wounded in a shooting on the city's west side.
Police spokeswoman Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia (CHAWCH') says all three victims were found shot in the head early Saturday.
Two males were pronounced dead at the scene. A female has been hospitalized. Her condition isn't known.
The shooting follows one Thursday afternoon at an abandoned home on the city's east side that killed a 16-year-old boy and a male whose age hasn't been made public. A 17-year-old boy was hospitalized with gunshot wounds.
Police haven't released additional details about either shooting.
