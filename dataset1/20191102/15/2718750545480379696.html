      <h1>Frank Ocean Takes Us ‘In My Room’ With New Song, and It Ain’t No West Elm Catalog</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T15:54:23+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 15:54</time> by <a rel="author">Devon Ivie</a></address>
      <p>What exclusive inclusive queer party <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/frank-ocean-prep-party-amid-criticism.html">controversy</a>? Weeks after coming out of a brief musical retirement with “<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/frank-ocean-releases-new-song-dhl-listen.html">DHL</a>,” which is <i>not </i>about the international currier and express mail company, Frank Ocean has dropped yet another track. With the introspective “In My Room,” Ocean skeptically croons about a certain someone (and so much more) over a simple synth beat: “Every night you are in my room / My room, my room with me / I guess I can’t state my feelings too soon / I don’t know you.” (As with all of his songs, head over to <a href="https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-in-my-room-lyrics">Genius</a> to analyze every stanza.) The <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/frank-ocean-dhl-song-review.html">ever-complicated era</a> of Ocean is upon us, are you prepared?</p>
