      <p>Jeremy Corbyn continued to put the NHS at the heart of his UK election campaign as he declared he was “deeply suspicious” of Boris Johnson’s plans for the health service.</p>
      <p>The British Labour leader visited Swindon on Saturday and said he was concerned how the Conservative Party’s relationship with the US could affect Britain’s public services.</p>
      <p>The party has said it will defend the NHS against a possible “sell out” to US corporations in a Donald Trump trade deal.</p>
      <p>Speaking at Commonweal Sixth Form College, Mr Corbyn brushed off recent criticism from the US president, saying: “I’m much more concerned about the relationship of the Tory party with the US government and the US on our public services.</p>
      <blockquote>I believe passionately in an NHS free at the point of use for everybody in this country</blockquote>
      <p>“And the deals they’ve been apparently prepared to do with US pharmaceutical companies for our NHS.</p>
      <p>“I want our NHS to be ours, publicly owned and publicly run. And that’s exactly what will happen with a Labour government.”</p>
      <p>Mr Trump has ruled out the NHS being part of negotiations for a post-Brexit trade deal, a key allegation in Labour’s campaign.</p>

      <p>His comments came after the Prime Minister failed to rule out expanding private provisioning in the NHS in future.</p>
      <p>In an interview with BBC News on Friday, Mr Johnson was asked whether he would rule out further use of the private sector in the health service.</p>
      <p>He did not directly answer the question, instead replying: “What I will tell you, well of course there are dentists and optometrists and so on who are providers to the NHS, of course, that’s how it works.</p>
      <p>“But we are, we believe, I believe passionately in an NHS free at the point of use for everybody in this country.”</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson also said he was “absolutely determined” to increase taxpayer funding of the health service and accused Labour of trying to divert the campaign narrative away from Brexit.</p>
