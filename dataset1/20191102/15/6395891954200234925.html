      <p>"We ask all fans to join our Pirates family in sending thoughts and prayers at this difficult time to Vera and the entire Clemente family," the Pirates <a href="https://twitter.com/Pirates/status/1190388084040445953?s=20">tweeted</a>.</p>
      <p>Vera Cristina Zabala married the Pirates' right fielder Nov. 14, 1964, in Carolina, Puerto Rico. The couple had three children -- Roberto Clemente Jr., Luis Roberto Clemente and Roberto Enrique Clemente.</p>
      <p>Vera Clemente is a graduate of the University of Puerto Rico.</p>
      <p>Roberto Clemente played for the Pirates from 1954 to 1972. He collected 3,000 regular-season hits and played for World Series-winning teams in 1960 and 1971. He was named the MVP of the '71 Series after batting .414 against the Baltimore Orioles. He had a career batting average of .317 and won four National League batting titles.</p>
      <p>Clemente was inducted into the Hall of Fame in a special election in 1973.</p>
      <p>The Pirates star died Dec. 31, when the plane he was a passenger on crashed just north of the Puerto Rican coast after takeoff. Clemente was en route to Nicaragua to deliver supplies after that country was devastated by an earthquake.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://robertoclementefoundation.com/about-us/vera-clemente-2/">Roberto Clemente Foundation</a>, Vera Clemente is chairwoman of the organization and is a goodwill ambassador for Major League Baseball. She has hosted a telethon on behalf of MLB in Puerto Rico to raise money for the Ciudad Roberto Clemente in that country.</p>
