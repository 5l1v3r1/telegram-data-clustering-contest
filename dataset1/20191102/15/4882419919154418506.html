      <h1>Ajax star Ünüvar flattered by Barcelona interest but focused on World Cup</h1>
      <h2>The forward is currently taking part in the U17 World Cup in Brazil</h2>

      <p>Naci Ünüvar is one of the youngsters Barcelona are following at the U17 World Cup in Brazil. The young Ajax attacker is playing for the Netherlands and is focused on his job for his national team rather than interest from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>"I am flattered by Barça's interest but right now I am only thinking about the World Cup," said Ünüvar, who's not having a great tournament, with the Netherlands losing their first two games.</p>
      <p>"The messages from Barça, right now, take second place. I am completely focused on this competition."</p>
      <p>Ünüvar, only 16, has burst on to the scene this season and is hoping to break into the Ajax first team, as Ansu Fati has done at Barcelona.</p>
      <p>Fans of the Catalan club will already be aware of him. He scored the two goals in the first-ever game at the Johan Cruyff Stadium when Barça's U19s lost 2-0 to their Ajax counterparts.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the Ajax website, he says he usually plays "as a No.10" but he can also play wide.</p>
      <p>Last season, he became the youngest player to score in the UEFA Youth League when at 15 years, three months and six days he netted in a 6-0 win against AEK Athens.</p>
