      <h1>Video: UFC 245’s Colby Covington accuses Kamaru Usman of using EPO</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T15:30:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>Colby Covington seemed to have caught Kamaru Usman by surprise at yesterday’s UFC 245 pre-fight press conference in New York, accusing the welterweight champion of using EPO, the injectable-only performance-enhancing drug former bantamweight titleholder T.J. Dillashaw tested positive for at UFC on ESPN+1.</p>
      <p>“Everybody knows the Blackzilians team is notorious for doing steroids,” Covington said about Usman’s team, per <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/2/20944472/colby-covington-accuses-kamaru-usman-of-using-epo-welterweight-champ-fires-back">MMA Fighting’s Damon Martin</a>. “<a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/434/anthony-johnson">Anthony Johnson</a>, <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/43/rashad-evans">Rashad Evans</a>, all the guys over there, <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/32/alistair-overeem">Alistair Overeem</a> when he was over there.</p>
      <p>“I have inside information that he was doing EPO for a couple years and that’s just that. That’s a fact. He has no good response. He can’t even defend himself. I think it’s pretty clear he’s on steroids but it’s not going to make a difference because when I get my hands on him, he will melt.</p>
      <p>“I’ll pay you $25,000 if you can pee in a cup right now and it passes,” Covington added. “I will. I’ll put it up right now.”</p>

      <p>Usman was forced to reply but, interestingly enough, ‘The Nigerian Nightmare’ didn’t deny using PEDs.</p>
      <p>“Put your money up,” Usman snapped back. “They all say that. With the way I’m beating guys, they all say that. But it is what it is. Dec. 14 there will be a beheading, and everyone will see it and watch it live.”</p>
      <p>“That’s not a very good explanation, buddy,” Covington interjected. “You sound like you’re stuttering over there. You OK? I know you gave Glenn [Robinson] a heart attack for all those years you were ducking me, so don’t worry, he’ll be watching from hell on Dec. 14.”</p>
      <p>Usman, who thrashed Tyron Woodley at UFC 235 to capture the welterweight title, made sure to have the last word on the matter.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t really matter,” he said. “I don’t avoid anything. I said yes to everything. All I’m waiting for is Dec. 14 that you guys finally get the fight you all wanted for so long. Real quick, let’s make some noise that Dec. 14 you guys can’t wait for me to murder this clown.”</p>
      <p>It’s important to note that, despite Covington’s accusations, Usman has never failed a drug test throughout his career and the burden of proof is on Covington to provide sufficient evidence for his claims.</p>
      <p>UFC 245: Usman vs. Covington takes place next month, Dec. 14 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.</p>
