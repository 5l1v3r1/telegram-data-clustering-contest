Another building collapsed in Lagos
02 Nov 2019, 15:22 by Abdoulaye Issa

A building collapsed yesterday in Ikoyi area of Lagos State. The Chairman of the Emergency Management Agency in Lagos, Nigeria, Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, has confirmed that four people have been rescued from the wreckage of the building.

The collapsed building, one of the four floors under construction in Clover Court, collapsed on the second floor at the same time as the concrete. Some sources say one of the lab workers at the site died, while others were injured.
The demolition of tall buildings is not unusual in Nigeria because even in September 2014, at least 116 people died after a 6-story building collapsed in Lagos state, including 84 South Africans, later found that the building was being made illegal.
