Frank Ocean Takes Us ‘In My Room’ With New Song, and It Ain’t No West Elm Catalog
02 Nov 2019, 15:54 by Devon Ivie
What exclusive inclusive queer party controversy? Weeks after coming out of a brief musical retirement with “DHL,” which is not about the international currier and express mail company, Frank Ocean has dropped yet another track. With the introspective “In My Room,” Ocean skeptically croons about a certain someone (and so much more) over a simple synth beat: “Every night you are in my room / My room, my room with me / I guess I can’t state my feelings too soon / I don’t know you.” (As with all of his songs, head over to Genius to analyze every stanza.) The ever-complicated era of Ocean is upon us, are you prepared?
