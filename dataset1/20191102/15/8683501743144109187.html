      <p>I still can't believe <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/pop/2466554/chris-pratt-was-nervous-to-ask-arnold-schwarzeneggers-permission-before-proposing-to-katherine">the Terminator is Star-Lord's father-in-law</a>. But it's true. When Marvel star <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/pop/2474633/chris-pratt-and-katherine-schwarzenegger-share-photo-from-beautiful-wedding">Chris Pratt married Katherine Schwarzenegger</a> he became Arnold Schwarzenegger's son-in-law.</p>
      <p>Chris and new wife Katherine just went to see Dad's new movie, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2469809/terminator-dark-fate"><i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i></a>. In this movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays an aging Terminator model now named Carl, which is just hilarious to imagine, and irresistible catnip to Chris Pratt.</p>
      <p>Here's what Chris Pratt posted after he and Katherine went to see the new <i>Terminator</i> movie:</p>
      <blockquote>Watched <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> tonight. So surreal to look over at my wife as she watches her dad, @schwarzenegger reprise his role as the baddest robot on the planet, tears streaming down her face, hanging on the edge of her seat. Priceless. Way to go Arnold! The movie is fantastic! I’m calling you Carl now.</blockquote>
      <p>I dare him to! Arnold Schwarzenegger has a good sense of humor about most things, and he commented on his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4ThwDtJDT9/">son-in-law's post</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>You can absolutely call me Carl. Thank you and I’m pumped that you loved it!</blockquote>
      <p>I would be terrified to even joke around Arnold Schwarzenegger, but it sounds like Chris Pratt and his Terminator father-in-law get along just fine. Here's Pratt's post:</p>

      <p>Katherine Schwarzenegger, age 29, is the one who grew up watching her father play the Terminator. In honor of <i>Terminator 6</i>, she <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4VFvztALNG/">shared some memories</a> of her times on set with her Terminator dad:</p>

      <p>Love those photos. In that first one, Baby Katherine doesn't look too scared by her seriously messed-up-looking dad. She must've gotten used to it fairly early.</p>
      <p><i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> continues the story directly from <i>The Terminator</i> and <i>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</i>, ignoring the other films that came after. <i>Dark Fate</i> just opened in theaters and so far fans and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482901/terminator-dark-fate-reviews-are-in-heres-what-the-critics-are-saying">critics seem to like it</a>. It has a B+ CinemaScore from moviegoers polled on opening night, an 87% RT audience score from 376 users to date, and a score of 6.6/10 from 16,882 IMDb users to date.</p>
      <p><i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> is expected to easily top the domestic box office this weekend, with an estimate <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2479401/how-much-terminator-dark-fate-could-make-opening-weekend">somewhere around $40 million</a>. (Or not, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483700/is-terminator-dark-fates-quiet-opening-a-death-sentence-for-that-trilogy-plan">not anymore</a>. #yikes.) Producer James Cameron has talked about <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478949/james-cameron-says-terminator-dark-fate-could-start-a-trilogy">a potential new trilogy</a> -- he's all about multiple sequels these days -- but that will partly depend <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483271/terminator-dark-fates-international-kick-off-did-not-pull-in-great-box-office-numbers">on how well <i>Dark Fate</i> does</a>. There was once thought that <i>Terminator Genisys</i> <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/592019/Terminator-Genisys-Really-Kick-Off-Trilogy-Here-What-Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Says">would be the start of a new trilogy</a>, too.</p>
