FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - A South Florida priest showed he can do more than preach and teach. He showed off some heavenly dance steps, too.



Ricardo Rivera, a senior theology teacher and recently ordained priest at Cardinal Gibbons High School in Fort Lauderdale, stole the show when the school held a homecoming pep rally in the gym last weekend.



The video, which has more than 22,000 views on Twitter since it was posted Oct. 26, shows the school's cheerleaders and dance team performing in the high school gym, the Miami Herald reported.
During the pep rally, Rivera approaches, then turns around and dances in sync with the music and the performers.
Rivera's appearance was a surprise to all except the Cardinal Gibbons dance coach, WPTV reported. Rivera, from Puerto Rico, practiced the initial moves in the week leading up to the pep rally, Fox News reported. Then he memorized the entire routine.
Predictably, Rivera's moves drew a raucous response from the student body.
Rivera was not giving interviews about his performance, the Herald reported. However, social media posters had plenty to say.
“Now this is what I’d like to refer to as dancing for Jesus!” Twitter user Laurie Harris tweeted. “Love it!”
Rivera now has his own hashtag: #dancingpriest.
