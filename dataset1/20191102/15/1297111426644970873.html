      <p>When Gordon Gerrard first heard about Missing, presented in November 2017 in Vancouver and Victoria, he immediately wanted to bring it to Regina.</p>
      <p>“I felt strongly that it was a story that, well, frankly everybody in Canada needs to see and hear. And I thought we would do our best to try and make it happen in Regina,” said Gerrard, music director of the Regina Symphony Orchestra.</p>
      <p>“So I’m thrilled that we’ve actually put all the pieces together and brought all the right people.”</p>
      <p>Among those people were the RSO’s Indigenous Advisory Council, and <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/access-to-safe-affordable-housing-more-important-than-ever-says-indigenous-advocate">Erica Beaudin, executive director of Regina Treaty/Status Indian Services (RT/SIS).</a></p>
      <p>“What’s very unique about the RSO providing the opportunity for us to partner, is that this is an art form that not many Indigenous people, especially the families of MMIWG2S, have access to,” said Beaudin.</p>
      <p><a href="https://wp.me/p6FXD5-2og4">Missing is an opera commemorating missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada.</a> Co-written by Marie Clements and Brian Current, it is being co-produced in Regina Nov. 8-9 by the RSO and Pacific Opera Victoria.</p>
      <p>It’s in part funded by the federal government’s MMIWG Commemoration Fund.</p>

      <p>“Mixing Indigenous voice with the Western classical music tradition, I’m always looking at it from two vantage points,” said Gerrard.</p>
      <p>“I’m really hoping that there are Indigenous people that are happy to see their story, their voices, on our stages. And I also hope that our, I would call, more traditional audience has a chance to experience something different and to maybe think about things they hadn’t thought of before and stories that they’re not used to hearing.”</p>
      <p>Beaudin agreed.</p>
      <p>“What you would consider as the stereotypical profile of those who would be patrons of symphony orchestras, they wouldn’t have very much connection or knowledge of the violence that Indigenous people — specifically Indigenous women and children — are born into, and live in the exact same city that the people who are patrons of the RSO live (in),” said Beaudin.</p>
      <p>She hopes it will give audience members insight into the lives of Indigenous women, inspire empathy, and “provide opportunity for people to change from their thinking, to changing action.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/east-canadian-tire-to-implement-training-program-after-racial-profiling-incident">“Many of those people may be in positions to change policies, to change procedures, to hiring practices, tolerance, tolerance levels of their employees.</a> That’s the way that this can have impact,” she added.</p>
      <p>For Indigenous audience members, Beaudin hopes “this performance will open up their appreciation of a different type of art that they have not encountered.”</p>
