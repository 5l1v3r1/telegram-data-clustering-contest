      <h3>Should I buy the Toshiba Canvio Advance Portable Hard Drive 4TB?</h3>
      <p>Expert's Rating:<br/>●●●●○</p>
      <p>The slim, lightweight 4TB Toshiba Canvio Advance offers a large capacity at a price well under what you’d pay for an SSD. Yes, it’s slower than a solid-state drive but if you need a reliable backup drive this is an affordable option that is also faster than some of its competitors – scoring around 150MB/s in Read and Write tests.</p>
      <h3>Price when reviewed</h3>
      <p>£89.99 (1TB); £99.99 (4TB)</p>
      <h3>Toshiba Canvio Advance Portable Hard Drive 4TB full review</h3>
      <p>Need an affordable hard drive with a high capacity that you can carry around with you or use for off-site backups, and you’ll be looking for a HDD (Hard Disk Drive), a proven storage medium that’s been around for years.</p>
      <p>HDDs today come in capacities unthinkable only a few years ago. For a little over £100/$100 you can pick up a portable hard drive that can carry 5TB.</p>
      <p>If you want a speedy portable hard drive you need an SSD (Solid State Drive), which act like giant USB drives with their non-volatile electronic storage.</p>
      <p>SSDs are fast, but they are not cheap, and don’t come in these mega highest capacities. For our favourites check out the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/storage/best-portable-hard-drive-ssd-3219375/">best portable hard drives and SSDs</a>.</p>
      <p>For true portability look for a 2.5in HDD, which are bus-powered, meaning that they draw power from the computer and don’t require an external power supply.</p>
      <p>Toshiba’s Canvio hard-drive family come in a range of models, from Basics to Advance.</p>
      <p>Each model is distinguished by capacity, backup and security software, finish (matte or glossy) and a range of colours.</p>
      <p>Capacities range from 500GB to 4TB.</p>
      <p>We tested the <b>Canvio Advance</b> range, which is available in four colour options - black, white, blue or red - with a glossy finish, and in 1TB, 2TB, 3TB and 4TB capacities.</p>
      <p>Like the top-end Canvio Premium model, Advance offers free downloadable Toshiba Storage Backup Software (auto-copy) and Storage Security Software for password protection.</p>
      <p>You can buy a minimalist model with just a cable sitting alongside the HDD in its box: the Canvio Basics costs around <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Toshiba-HDTB420EK3AA-2-5-Inch-Portable-External/dp/B07994QL95/?ascsubtag=06-3777128-11-3777127">£50</a> / <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-HDTB420XK3AA-Canvio-Portable-External/dp/B079D3D8NR/?ascsubtag=06-3777128-11-3777127">$60</a> for 2TB in matte black design.</p>

      <h3>Toshiba Canvio Advance HDD price</h3>
      <p>Amazon has the 4TB Canvio Advance for around <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC940XK3CA/dp/B07KQXRJPF/?ascsubtag=06-3777128-11-3777127">£85</a> / <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC940XW3CA/dp/B07KQXRJPF/?th=1&amp;ascsubtag=06-3777128-11-3777127">$95</a>, which is a little cheaper than the WD My Passport.</p>
      <p>The 2TB Toshiba model should, of course, be cheaper - but is not much less in the UK, where at the time of writing Amazon has it for around the same price as the 4TB.</p>
      <p>Seeing as 4TB, well, twice as capacious as 2TB, we’d recommend the bigger drive.</p>
      <p>In the US, Amazon sells the 2TB model for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Advance-Portable-External-HDTC920XW3AA/dp/B079H83D53?ascsubtag=06-3777128-11-3777127">under $65</a>.</p>

      <h3>Toshiba Canvio Advance HDD speed tests</h3>
      <p>In our speed tests – using CrystalDiskMark - the 2TB Canvio Advance scored reasonably for an HDD – with a Read speed of 149.6MB/s and a Write speed of 156.3MB/s when transferring large files.</p>
      <p>The 4TB Canvio Advance scored a little slower, but not of any significance – 137.9MB/s Read and 153.8MB/s Write.</p>
      <p>That’s pretty puny compared to an SSD, but many of us need a reliable backup chugging away in the background rather than the fastest transfer speeds. A little patience saves you a fistful of cash.</p>
      <p>And the Canvio Advance is faster than the respected <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/portable-storage/wd-my-passport-4tb-2016-3449074/">WD My Passport portable hard drive</a>, which scored just 120.5MB/s in our Read tests.</p>
      <p>It's a decent performer for copying photos and videos for backups, and even the write speeds for small files is quite nippy - if you remember that transferring lots of smaller files will reduce speeds.</p>

      <h3>Format and connection</h3>
      <p>The Canvio HDDs come pre-formatted with an NTFS file system, which is great for Windows PCs – although Macs will require reformatting to HFS+ with the Mac’s Disk Utility.</p>
      <p>It connects to your computer via the included micro-B USB to USB-A cable. If your laptop features a faster USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 port, you’ll need to buy a micro-B USB to USB-C cable. USB-C users might consider the Canvio Premium HDD, which comes with a Type-A to Type-C adapter.</p>
      <p>(The Premium models come in an aluminium-finish design with diamond-cut edges and in silver or dark grey metallic.)</p>
      <p>The Advance comes with a two-year warranty.</p>
      <h3>Portable design</h3>
      <p>The Canvio Advance is slim and lightweight: 149g for the 1TB and 2TB models, 210g for the 3TB and 4TB.</p>
      <p>The 4TB Advance uses 1TB platter technology so maintains the same low-profile design (109mm-×-78mm-×-19mm) as the 3TB model.</p>
      <p>The 1TB and 2TB models measure 8mm-x-109mm-x-14mm.</p>
      <p>The glossy finish is nice. If you want one with a more metallic finisg, you need to stump up the few extra quid for the even slimmer Premium model, although that doesn’t come in such fancy colours as the Advance.</p>
      <p>There are no little rubber feet to minimise drive noise, but we found it pretty quiet whirring away even without them.</p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>The slim, lightweight 4TB Toshiba Canvio Advance offers a large capacity at a price well under what you’d pay for an SSD. Yes, it’s slower but if you need a reliable backup drive this is an affordable option that is also faster than some of its competitors – scoring around 150MB/s in Read and Write tests.</p>
