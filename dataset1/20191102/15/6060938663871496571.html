      <p>SAARBRÃœCKEN (Germany): <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Lakshya-Sen">Lakshya Sen</a> prevailed over <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kiran-George">Kiran George</a> 21-13, 14-21, 21-9 in an exciting all-Indian semifinal of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/SaarLorLux-Open">SaarLorLux Open</a> badminton on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Sen, seeded eighth in the tournament, needed 37 minutes to win his men's singles last-four clash against compatriot George and enter the final.</p>
      <p>George, ranked 156 in the world, came into the match without dropping a set and looked confident in the second game after losing the opener.</p>
      <p>However, his fancied opponent was in his element in the third game and sailed into the final. World number 51 Sen thus continued to impress on the senior circuit.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old is looking to clinch back-to-back Super 100 titles after his <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Dutch-Open">Dutch Open</a> win earlier in October. If he goes all the way, it will be a hat-trick of titles as his previous two tournaments (Dutch Open Super 100 and Belgian International Challenge) saw him emerge victorious as well.</p>
      <p>The semi-final here was the fifth meeting between George and Sen in the international arena, with the latter winning all five.</p>
      <p>Both had won their respective quarter-final matches in straight games.</p>
