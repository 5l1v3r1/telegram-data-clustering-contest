      <h1>House goes on sale for £1.3m - but photos of inside leave people feeling 'ill'</h1>
      <h2>The bizarre feature of the £1.3m home has left people baffled after being spotted by a house-hunter</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T15:19:30+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 15:19</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>Everyone has to make a few compromises when it comes to finding a new home.</p>
      <p>Whether it's location, size or knowing you'll have to part with even more of your hard earned cash for renovations, it's rare to find the complete package.</p>
      <p>One five-bedroom detached home in Middlesex has gone on the market for a cool £1.3m, promising a family-friendly location, bright spaces and a conservatory leading to a patio area and spacious garden behind.</p>
      <p>It all sounds pretty ideal for those who are a bit more flushed with cash than us but one home-hunter spotted one major issue - or should we say one hundred.</p>

      <p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/tobydavies/status/1190213025464307716?s=21">post</a> on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> which has since had more than 4,000 likes and 1,400 retweets, Toby Davies wrote: "Thinking about buying this house, but I'm not sure it has enough plug sockets."</p>
      <p>As photos of the home move from the stunning exterior, to the dreamy kitchen and then to the living area, Toby's sarcastic concerns become very apparent.</p>
      <p>Every wall appears to be absolutely plastered in sockets. Sockets stacked on top of one another, sockets halfway up the walls and sockets running underneath the windows.</p>
      <p>So. Many. Sockets.</p>

      <p>With the owners clearly having never laid eyes on a multi-plug adapter, people were left completely baffled as to what all the outlets were possibly used for.</p>
      <p>Questions include 'were they running the CIA from the front room?' and 'was this an electrician's training centre at one point?'.</p>
      <p>Another joked the last electricity bill was £1,452,092 for the quarter.</p>
      <p>For those who are big fans of electricity, it could be the perfect property, offering three bathrooms, a garage and a lovely breakfast bar.</p>
      <p>The online description fails to address quite why there are so many sockets.</p>
      <p>It's little wonder they are charging so much. Ba dum tss!</p>
