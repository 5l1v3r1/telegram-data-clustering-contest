      <p><b>WEYMOUTH, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - A bronze plaque to honor a Massachusetts native who earned the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions in Afghanistan is being unveiled next weekend.</p>
      <p>Marc Frattasio, of the ANA Patriot Squadron at Weymouth's Union Point, tells The Enterprise the plaque in honor Army Sgt. 1st Class Jared Monti will be unveiled Nov. 10 at Shea Memorial Grove.</p>
      <p>Monti is being honored for his efforts to save a wounded soldier in 2006 during a firefight with the Taliban. By trying to save his comrade, lost his own life.</p>
