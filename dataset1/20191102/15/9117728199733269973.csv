Haas ""learned a lot"" on Friday despite slow laptimes
02 Nov 2019, 15:59 by Adam Newton

Haas F1 team boss Guenther Steiner says that his team gained a lot of knowledge on Friday running, despite Kevin Magnussen and Romain Grosjean not setting competitive lap times in FP2, with Grosjean crashing in the same session.

Haas have been struggling of late and have scored just two points in the last seven races, courtesy of Kevin Magnussen's ninth placed finish at the Russian Grand Prix.



The team have had issues with tyres for the whole season, but will be desperate to put on a good show at their home Grand Prix in Austin this weekend.
FP1 was encouraging, but the duo slipped back in the second session. Despite this, Steiner remains positive, saying on Friday: “It was a very busy day today. FP1 went to plan, everything seemed to be fine. Then in FP2 we had planned a lot of testing, especially with Kevin.




""We achieved all our results there, even if the times maybe don’t look good, we learned a lot. We now have a lot of data to look through. Unfortunately, Romain had a crash on his second fast lap, so he couldn’t do anymore driving. We’ll have the car fixed for tomorrow. We’ll be back on track and we’ll see what we can do.”
