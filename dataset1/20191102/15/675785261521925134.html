      <h1>Granit Xhaka sends message to the Arsenal fans after being left out squad for Wolves</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal boss Unai Emery confirmed on Friday Granit Xhaka would play no part in this weekend's home clash with Wolves</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T15:44:24+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 15:44</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Granit Xhaka has proven he's still a Gooner despite his recent spat with fans resulting him being left out of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> squad this weekend.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are in action against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves,</a> where they took an early lead through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at the Emirates this Saturday.</p>
      <p>Arsenal boss Unai Emery confirmed Xhaka would play no part in the match in the week, saying the midfielder is not in the right frame of mind at the moment.</p>
      <p>But Arsenal captain Xhaka wanted Gunners supporters to know that he still loves the team by posting an image of him watching the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> game on his home TV.</p>

      <p>Alongside the image of the Gunners stars in action, Xhaka wrote: "Come on boys."</p>
      <p>Xhaka clashed with fans last Sunday during the 2-2 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace.</a> The Swiss reacted to supporters booing him by swearing back at them and cupping his ears.</p>
      <p>He released a statement after the incident, reading: "After taking some time to reflect on what happened on Sunday afternoon, I would like to give you an explanation rather than just a quick response.</p>
      <p>"The scenes that took place around my substitution have moved me deeply. I love this club and always give 100% on and off the pitch.</p>
      <p>"My feeling of not being understood by fans, and repeated abusive comments at matches and in social media over the last weeks and months have me deeply.</p>

      <p>"People have said things like "We will break your legs", "Kill your wife" and "Wish that your daughter gets cancer".</p>
      <p>"That has stirred me up and I reached boiling point when I felt the rejection in the stadium on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"In this situation, I let myself be carried away and reacted in a way that disrespected the group of fans that support our club, our team and myself with positive energy.</p>

      <p>"That has not been my intention and I'm sorry if that's what people thought.</p>
      <p>"My wish is that we get back to a place of mutual respect, remembering why we fell in love with this game in the first place. Let's move forward positively together. Granit."</p>
