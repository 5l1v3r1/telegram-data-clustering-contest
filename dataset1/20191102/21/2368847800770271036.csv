英發表《香港半年報告》 中共外交部惱羞成怒回應

02 Nov 2019, 21:47

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】香港反送中以來，英美政府對中共持續施壓。日前英方發表《香港問題半年報告》，呼籲以政治手法解決問題，各方進行「有意義」的對話。中共外交部再次強烈回應，要英方停止「說三道四」。
英國政府10月31日發表的這份報告，旨在總結今年1月至6月香港的情況。英國每半年會就香港發表一份報告，總結《中英聯合聲明》執行狀況。這是香港反送中運動以來的首份半年報告。
在這份報告中，英國政府強調，香港目前的局勢需要以政治手法解決，各方必須進行「有意義」的對話。
英國外相拉布（Dominic Raab）在報告中表示，香港已處在近代最為動蕩的時期之一，英國政府對此「嚴重關切」，並重申香港的高度自治和法治是它未來繁榮和成功的保證，各方必須對它予以保護。
拉布同時透露，他早前會見中共外長王毅和香港特首林鄭月娥時都指出，香港目前必須找尋方法令局勢降溫，同時以政治方式解決問題。
拉布並重申，英中雙方當年簽署的《聯合聲明》是一個具有法律效力的國際條約，中方稱其「已經失效」是不可接受的。
針對英方報告，中共外交部的回應秉承了其一貫語帶侮辱的激烈言辭。報告發表當日，中共外交部駐港公署發言人再次表示，《中英聯合聲明》已經是「歷史文件」，香港事務「純屬中國內政」，「與英國無關」。
中共外交部發言人次日在例行記者會上表示，對英方就香港事務「說三道四的錯誤做法」表示「強烈不滿和堅決反對」，並要求英國政府停止發表有關報告，停止以任何方式「插手香港事務」。

Britain publishes ""Hong Kong Half-Year Report""

02 Nov 2019, 21:47

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] Since the reversal of Hong Kong, the British and American governments have continued to exert pressure on the CCP. A few days ago, the British side published the ""Six-Year Report on Hong Kong Issues"", calling for political solutions to solve problems and conducting ""meaningful"" dialogues. The Chinese Foreign Ministry once again strongly responded that the British side should stop ""speaking irresponsiblely.""
The report issued by the British government on October 31st aims to summarize the situation in Hong Kong from January to June this year. The UK will publish a report on Hong Kong every six months to summarize the implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. This is the first semi-annual report since the Hong Kong Anti-China Campaign.
In this report, the British government stressed that the current situation in Hong Kong needs to be resolved by political means, and all parties must engage in ""meaningful"" dialogue.
British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab said in his report that Hong Kong is already in one of the most turbulent periods in modern times. The British government is ""seriously concerned"" about this and reiterates that Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and the rule of law are its guarantee of future prosperity and success. The parties must protect it.
Rab also revealed that when he met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Hong Kong Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue, he pointed out that Hong Kong must now find ways to cool the situation and solve the problem politically.
Rab also reiterated that the ""Joint Statement"" signed by the British and Chinese sides was a legally binding international treaty. The Chinese side said that it ""has expired"" is unacceptable.
In response to the British report, the response of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has inherited the fierce rhetoric of its consistent language. On the day of the report, the spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ Office of the Hong Kong Government once again stated that the Sino-British Joint Declaration is already a ""historical document"". Hong Kong affairs ""are purely China's internal affairs"" and ""have nothing to do with the United Kingdom.""
The spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said at a regular press conference the following day that he expressed ""strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition"" to the British side's ""wrong way of doing things in Hong Kong"" and asked the British government to stop publishing the report and stop any The way to ""intervene in Hong Kong affairs"".
