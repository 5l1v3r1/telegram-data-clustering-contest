UFC reveals ‘BMF’ belt ahead of UFC 244: Masvidal vs. Diaz
02 Nov 2019, 21:30 by Lewis Mckeever



The hour is almost upon us, and the UFC has finally revealed the ‘BMF’ belt ahead of tonight’s highly anticipated UFC 244 main event between Nate Diaz and Jorge Masvidal.
The winner will be crowned the ‘baddest motherf-cker’ on the planet and have Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson present them with the BMF title, which you can view below, courtesy of MMA Fighting’s Esther Lin.



Although the official UFC welterweight title won’t be on the line, Diaz vs. Masvidal is anticipated to be much bigger than next month’s welterweight title bout between Kamaru Usman (C) and Colby Covington at UFC 245.
