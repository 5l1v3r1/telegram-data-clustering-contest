      <p>A source says: “She is now a very wealthy young woman and is earning more each year. She’s delighted to be in this position.”</p>
      <p>Scarlett revealed during her stint in the Aussie jungle that she’d been able to pay off the mortgage on her parents’ house in County Durham.</p>
      <p>She said: “Oh it was the best. I just wrote them a letter and said, ‘Thanks for being mint’, and ‘Sorry for leaving fake tan all over the house’, and then I put a cheque in for them.”</p>
      <p>They have since moved to a larger house with her help.</p>

      <p>Scarlett’s most recent show, The British Tribe Next Door, has been called exploitative and uncomfortable viewing by some critics.</p>
      <p>It sees her and her family living alongside a group of cattle herders in the African village of Otjeme, Namibia.</p>
      <p>But viewers have come round to the concept, praising its sentiment.</p>
