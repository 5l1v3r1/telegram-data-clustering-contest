      <h1>How Liverpool defeat has impacted Aston Villa relegation odds</h1>
      <h2>Premier League relegation odds latest | Dean Smith's side suffered a 2-1 defeat to Liverpool on Saturday thanks to goals from Andy Robertson and Sadio Mane at Villa Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T21:14:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 21:14</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa slipped to a second Premier League defeat in a row on Saturday, losing 2-1 to Liverpool at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp's side <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-player-ratings-liverpool-17191100">needed late goals from Andy Robertson and Sadio Mane</a> to keep up their unbeaten run in the League and ensure they escaped from B6 with all three points.</p>
      <p>It wasn't all plain sailing for the Reds, though, with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/trezeguet">Mahmoud Trezeguet</a> netting his first goal for the club on the 21st minute to set up a nervy finale.</p>
      <p>In the end the Villans couldn't hold out and that result leaves them in 16th place in the Premier League table after 14 matches of the season.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The table is starting to shape up now and as far as avoiding relegation is concerned, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> have 11 points to their name.</p>
      <p>That is three more than Southampton in the final relegation spot (18th).</p>
      <p>Watford are bottom of the League on five points while, remarkably, just six points separate Villa from Arsenal in fifth place.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Here are the latest relegation odds...</i>
      </p>
      <p>Norwich City - 1/3</p>
      <p>Watford - 4/5</p>
