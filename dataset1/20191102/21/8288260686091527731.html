      <h1>Fuming Gorka Marquez's sly swipe at Strictly bosses after being snubbed for Kevin Clifton</h1>
      <h2>Gorka was in the running to replace Neil Jones as Alex Scott's partner on the show, it has emerged</h2>

      <p>Strictly Come Dancing's Gorka Marquez has made his feelings known after he was snubbed by the BBC One show.</p>
      <p>Gorka was in the running to replace Neil Jones as Alex Scott's partner on the show, it has emerged.</p>
      <p>But the pro - who wasn't partnered with anybody for this current series of the show - missed out.</p>
      <p>Instead, the former Arsenal footballer and BBC pundit was paired with Kevin Clifton after Neil's injury.</p>
      <p>Kevin was already given one chance this series, being paired with Anneka Rice.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>But the Strictly duo were given the boot early on - and many thought Kevin's time on the show in 2019 was up.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But Neil's injury has meant Kevin has partnered Alex two weeks in a row.</p>
      <p>And Gorka isn't happy.</p>
      <p>The partner of former Emmerdale actress Gemma Atkinson who he met on the show in 2017, has been retweeting messages from fans saying he should be Neil's stand-in.</p>
      <p>"@gorkamarquez1would of been PERFECT to dance with Alex tonight since Neil couldn’t due to injury!!! Safe to say Gorka deserves a lot of appreciation!" commented one fan about last week's show.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Such a shame you couldn’t help out Alex tonight!" said another.</p>
      <p>"Should have be Gorks not #kingkev," said a third.</p>
      <p>And another commented: "Couldn’t we have @gorkamarquez1 as a stand in."</p>
      <p>"Why have extra pros and not use them. Ermmmm hello @gorkamarquez1 deserved it not Kevin who has already had a partner this year #StrictlyComeDancing," wrote another annoyed viewer.</p>
