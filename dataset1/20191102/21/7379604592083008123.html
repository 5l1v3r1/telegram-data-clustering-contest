Did they catch Craig stealing the glitterball? Shirley pocketing the Strictly crown jewels? Something is UP.</li>

Were we in the same room tonight? And even Chris's dance – not sure we agree with the judges. Has someone been spiked?</li>

They didn't look like they clicked this week… I mean, they definitely look like a couple in love – but would you be able to feign being in love with Anton? Nah, us neither.</li>

Lack lustre. Judges too generous. Lacked magic and mystery.' That's what people are saying. Do you agree?</li>
