      <p>Children were encouraged to use their own personalized bricks to help "build the wall" during a Halloween party at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.</p>
      <p>The children's activity was on the first floor, next to the office of digital strategy and outside of a speechwriter’s office, <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/children-were-told-to-build-the-wall-at-white-house-halloween-party-153024720.html?ncid=twitter_yahoonewst_sjwumo1bpf4">according</a> to Yahoo News. It involved red paper bricks, each one with a child's name written on it, and the children were told to place them on the wall. There was also an "America First" sign next to the wall.</p>
      <p>The Eisenhower Executive Office Building is across from the White House and houses the vice president's office, as well as some of the West Wing support staff. A representative for Vice President Mike Pence said he was in the office building at the time of the party but did not attend.</p>
      <p>The border wall was been a signature of President Trump's campaign and presidency. Most recently, there have reports that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/smugglers-are-sawing-through-new-parts-of-border-wall">smugglers have used commercially available power tools</a> to break through the wall.</p>
