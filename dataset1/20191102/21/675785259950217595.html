      <h2>EXCLUSIVE An inquest into the death of 18-year-old Shante Turay-Thomas is due to take place next week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T21:18:07+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 21:18</time> by <a rel="author">Phil Cardy, Martyn Halle, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/phil-cardy/</a></address>
      <p>A teenage girl died of suspected anaphylactic shock after her anti-allergy device allegedly failed to work.</p>
      <p>Shante Turay-Thomas, 18, may not have known about a fault that was reportedly found in a small number of the Emerade injecting devices three months earlier.</p>
      <p>Her grieving mum Emma also claims she had to wait an hour for an ambulance after a mix up.</p>
      <p>An inquest starts on Monday into nut allergy victim Shante, who died last September as she was about to start a law degree at Sussex University, in Brighton.</p>
      <p>Emma, 46, said: “I hope action will be taken to ensure that no other families have to endure a loss like ours .”</p>

      <p>Shante suffered a suspected allergic reaction after eating food thought to contain hazelnuts at home in Haringey, north London.</p>
      <p>Her mum called 111 as Shante’s condition worsened that night.</p>
      <p>She tried to use her Emerade adrenaline auto-injector pen but it allegedly did not work.</p>
      <p>Shante’s family claim an ambulance was wrongly sent to her granny’s address in Enfield, six miles away.</p>
      <p>When an ambulance arrived at the right address, Shante had been administering CPR for over 15 minutes but she died soon after reaching hospital.</p>
      <p>The Emerade fault was found in June 2018 and reportedly involved a needle getting blocked and not delivering adrenaline.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for its distributor Bausch and Lomb said it was thought to affect 1.5 per 10,000 devices, adding that no adverse reactions were reported.</p>
      <p>Concern over the device was made public this summer when a second fault was reported, with the needle not releasing in an estimated one in 500 devices.</p>
      <p>Emerade was not recalled but people who need them are advised to carry two so they have a back up at all times.</p>
      <p>London Central and West - which provides 111 help to two million people – said it was also unable to comment ahead of the inquest.</p>
