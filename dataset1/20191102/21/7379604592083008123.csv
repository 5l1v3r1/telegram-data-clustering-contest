vgarofalides1 minute agoNovember 2, 2019MIKE BE A FIX Seriously, what have they got over the judges? Did they catch Craig stealing the glitterball? Shirley pocketing the Strictly crown jewels? Something is UP.
vgarofalides8 minutes agoNovember 2, 2019WE'RE AS SHOCKED AS MIKE Really? Were we in the same room tonight? And even Chris's dance – not sure we agree with the judges. Has someone been spiked?
