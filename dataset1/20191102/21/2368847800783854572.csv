美國之音的報導指，34歲的美國公民楊帆（音譯，Fanyang）和他33歲的妻子楊洋（音譯，Yangyang）不但被控上述罪名，還被控合謀幫助另一名中國籍被告葛松濤（音譯，Songtao Ge），以造假方式在美獲得並使用槍械。
法庭文件顯示，49歲的葛松濤是中國上海微風科技公司董事長。第四名被告是該公司的員工、27歲的鄭艷（音譯，Zheng Yan）。兩人同為中國公民。
起訴書指，上海微風科技是軍用充氣船的真正買主，該公司想獲得美國公司出口的設備，而這些公司向美國海軍供貨，其設備無法合法地運往中國大陸。
楊帆擔任了該公司顧問，而他的妻子楊洋充當了上海微風和加州一家未具名船舶製造公司的聯絡人，兩人共同協助上海微風向加州的美軍承包商購買軍用充氣船，並隱藏該公司真實身份，謊稱是要出口到香港。從2016年11月至2019年8月，微風科技向楊帆夫婦的BQ Tree公司支付了至少20.5萬美元，而根據聯邦調查局（FBI）的調查，這是該公司2016年以來最主要收入。
起訴書指控，楊洋、葛松濤和鄭艷提交虛假信息，試圖出口七艘船舶和八台發動機，這些產品都被送到了上海微風在中國的辦公室。楊洋的公司還曾寄送兩個裝有USB儲存裝置的包裹給上海微風科技。今年10月17日，楊帆與楊洋夫婦遭到拘押。
據美媒相關報導，楊帆出生於中國，被捕前在傑克遜維爾海軍航空站海上巡邏偵察武器學校工作，並獲得了最高機密安全許可。他所屬的巡邏5中隊可以飛行P-8A波塞冬反潛飛機。
楊帆面臨的另一個指控是，他在今年1月更新安全許可時做出虛假陳述，並向槍支銷售商做出虛假陳述，以獲取給葛松濤的槍支。
近年來，美方明顯加大了打擊中共間諜盜取美國敏感技術的力度。傳媒也多次踢爆相關案情，引發美國公眾日漸關注來自中共的威脅。
今年10月18日，39歲中國籍男子李濤（音譯，Tao Li）在美國被捕，罪名涉嫌向中國非法出口軍事和航空用途技術。事後李濤認罪，被聯邦地方法院判處40個月監禁，以及3年獄後監管。
稍早的7月24日，美籍華人石山（音譯，Shan Shi）被控經濟間諜罪，罪名涉嫌盜竊一間設在侯斯頓、美國公司生產的復合薄膜塑料技術，該技術被確認可用於潛艇、石油勘探以及航天等多種軍用及民用領域。石山一旦被定罪，將面臨高達20年徒刑。
更早時候，2018年10月1日，南加州華裔女子陳思（音譯，Si Chen）在未獲商業部許可的情況下，涉嫌把敏感的技術設備出口到中國，其中包括用於軍事目的的衞星訊號干擾發射台。最終，陳思被洛杉磯聯邦地區法院定罪，判處3年監禁。
