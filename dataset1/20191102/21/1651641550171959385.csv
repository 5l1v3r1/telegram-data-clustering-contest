Android 10 comes to the OnePlus 6 and 6T
02 Nov 2019, 21:45 by Michael Allison
After delivering Android 10 for its OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro line of devices OnePlus is turning to its older flagships, and a lot sooner than expected. Now OnePlus 6 and 6T are receiving Google’s new Android version with all the OnePlus goodies stacked on top.
Here’s what’s new in this system update

Changelog




System


Upgraded to Android 10
Brand new UI design
Enhanced location permissions for privacy
New customization feature in Settings allowing you to choose icon shapes to be displayed in the Quick Settings
General bug fixes and improvements




Full Screen Gestures


Added inward swipes from the left or right edge of the screen to go back
Added a bottom navigation bar to allow switching left or right for recent apps




Game Space


New Game Space feature now joins all your favourite games in one place for easier access and better gaming experience




Contextual Display


Intelligent info based on specific times, locations and events for Ambient Display (Settings – Display – Ambient Display – Contextual Display)




Message


Now possible to block spam by keywords for Message (Messages – Spam – Settings – Blocking settings)



You can download Android 10 on your device over the next few days. OnePlus says that it’ll be delivering it in a staged roll-out over the next couple of days, so you probably won’t have long to wait.
