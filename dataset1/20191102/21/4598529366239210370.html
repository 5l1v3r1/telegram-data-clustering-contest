      <p>The rule change would eliminate language instituted during the Obama administration that specified that grant recipients could not discriminate “based on non-merit factors such as age, disability, sex, race, color, national origin, religion, gender identity, or sexual orientation.”</p>
      <p>The proposed language replaces that with a ban on discrimination “to the extent doing so is prohibited by federal statute.”</p>
      <p>Federal law currently protects against discrimination on the basis of race, disability status and other factors, but not sex or gender identity.</p>
