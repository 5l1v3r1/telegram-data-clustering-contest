How did these two get here?

Since making the move up to middleweight from 170-pounds, Gastelum has become one of the dictions top contenders. A submission loss to Chris Weidman was quickly forgotten about when Gastelum won consecutive fights against former champion Michael Bisping and Jacare Souza. Losing out the chance at middleweight gold when Robert Whittaker pulled out of their fight at UFC 234, Gastelum went on to fight Israel Adesanya for the interim title at UFC 236, losing by decision in what could be 2019’s Fight of the Year.
After going six years unbeaten in his MMA career, and winning fights in the UFC against the likes of Donald Cerrone and former welterweight title challenger Stephen Thompson, consecutive losses has meant Till has made the move up to middleweight. Facing a tough challenger in his debut in Gastelum, Till was adamant he didn’t want a step down in competition for his 185-pound debut.

Why should you care?

A must win for Till given his recent losses, Gastelum’s gritty style means he won’t be an easy fight for the Liverpudlian on Saturday night.
