      <h1>Trea Turner catches beer from Nationals fan at parade (Video)</h1>

      <p>Nationals fans were out in full force to celebrate the team’s first World Series championship in franchise history.</p>
      <p>The parade took place in Washington D.C. on Saturday, from the Washington Monument to just a few blocks from the Capitol. It began in the early afternoon, and gave both fans and players alike plenty of time to properly hydrate.</p>
      <p>Fans tried to help Nationals leadoff man Trea Turner do exactly that, as one of them threw him a beer can while the team was riding by on a bus. He uncorked a dime throw in Turner’s direction, and the Nats’ speedster caught it.</p>
