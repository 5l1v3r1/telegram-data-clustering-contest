French Defense Minister Florence Parly announced the death of the French military this Saturday, November 2.

Mrs Parly announced her plans for a future visit to Mali, a move that would allow her to negotiate with local authorities, where they are expected to address a range of issues, particularly in the area of security.
The soldier who met his fate was Ronan Pointeau, one of the French troops in Mali.
French President Emmanuel Macron has already sent condolences to the family.
