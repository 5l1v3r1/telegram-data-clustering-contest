Children were encouraged to use their own personalized bricks to help ""build the wall"" during a Halloween party at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.
The children's activity was on the first floor, next to the office of digital strategy and outside of a speechwriter’s office, according to Yahoo News. It involved red paper bricks, each one with a child's name written on it, and the children were told to place them on the wall. There was also an ""America First"" sign next to the wall.
The Eisenhower Executive Office Building is across from the White House and houses the vice president's office, as well as some of the West Wing support staff. A representative for Vice President Mike Pence said he was in the office building at the time of the party but did not attend.
The border wall was been a signature of President Trump's campaign and presidency. Most recently, there have reports that smugglers have used commercially available power tools to break through the wall.
