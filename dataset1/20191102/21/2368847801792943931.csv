港警腰斬集會抓2百人創紀錄 拘3區議會候選人惹眾怒

02 Nov 2019, 21:24

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】週六（2日），香港多區舉行集會和遊行，警方隨後暴力清場，包括多個合法集會也遭腰斬。當晚街戰持續到次日凌晨，官方稱抓捕超過二百人，創下一日內抓人最高記錄。警方還拘捕至少3名區議會候選人，被指暴力干預選舉。
當日下午開始，香港有大批民眾陸續上街抗議，在多個地點舉行集會和抗議活動。
其中，中環遮打花園的「和你摺紙」和愛丁堡廣場的「（美國）人權民主法案」集會，本已獲得警方的不反對通知書。但警方在遮打花園集會剛開始半個小時，就下令終止集會，隨後開始釋放催淚彈清場。下午5時辦，警方也以有人縱火為由，衝散了愛丁堡廣場的集會。

香港民間團體早前申請在港島維多利亞公園舉辦「112求援國際 堅守自治」集會，但遭警方禁止。隨後，超過130名民主派區議會選舉候選人，依據《選舉條例》發起下午3時在維園各自舉行不超過50人的選民聚會。但警方隨即包圍維園，在聚會開始前就宣稱市民「非法集會」，約一個小時後開始釋放催淚彈驅散，並抓捕抗議人士，導致眾多毫無防護裝備的選民狼狽走避。
多名議員候選人和警方理論，其後3名候選人陳振哲、鄭仲恆及文念志被警方暴力抓捕。
民間記者會隨後發聲明譴責警方，指責「黨衞軍」假借「執法」之名，配合中共港共政權打壓民主派候選人，明目張膽地以武力干擾選舉。民間記者會呼籲國際社會關注並援助香港人道危機，並希望美國國會盡快通過《香港民主與人權法案》，制裁在港殘害人民的中共代理人。60名泛民區議會候選人晚上也發表聯署聲明，批評警方以武力損害選舉公平。聲明稱，自己過去不會、現在不會、將來亦不會後退，因為「已經退無可退」。
入夜以後，港人分散到各區，繼續抗議活動。港警也出動防暴警察和水炮車等暴力清場，街頭催淚彈槍聲不斷，抗議市民陸續被暴力抓捕。有勇武派設置路障，用磚頭或汽油彈阻擊港警抓捕市民，一批防暴警一度被逼回尖沙咀警署內。期間，也有人破壞港鐵、中共駐港機構和親中商舖的店面，其中包括中共新華社駐港機構。

傍晚6時45分，防暴警在銅鑼灣向人群投擲中國制催淚彈，一名急救員被炸傷，隨即倒地。該急救員當時沒有防毒面具，吸入催淚煙。傷者背部大範圍燒傷，一度出現休克，之後被送往律敦治醫院救治。
傍晚在中環干諾道，防暴警施放催淚彈時波及一輛消防車。車上消防員下車和防暴警爆發口角，多名警察隨即圍住消防員，其餘警察立即使用胡椒噴劑趕走記者。
