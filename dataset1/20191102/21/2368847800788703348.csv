港民含淚致謝大紀元：是你們陪我們往前走

02 Nov 2019, 21:43

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】「是你們（《大紀元》）才讓那麼多人明白，我們真的是在被人打壓」，香港一名反送中抗爭者哽咽地說，現在她才明白「你們陪著我們在往前走。」
11月2日，港人在港島、九龍區、銅鑼灣等多地舉行抗議活動，抗議港府及中共暴政，並呼籲國際社會聲援香港。因為112是國際求援電話號碼，所以港人希望通過該活動讓其它國家也能效仿美國，制定《香港人權與民主法案》，保護港人本該擁有的民主、自由和法治。
一名年輕的媽媽在參加銅鑼灣附近維園舉行的「112 求援國際，堅守自治」流水式大集會前，接受了大紀元記者的採訪。
她說：「《大紀元》以前給我的感覺只是一個反共媒體，但這次大紀元竟然是我最佩服的。」
「（你們）令到這麼多人明白，我們現在正在被打壓。我的小朋友（小孩）很小，他的學校很喜歡講：一步一步往前走，其實我們正在一步一步往前走」，這名抗爭者說。
她說：「《大紀元》這次很犀利（指報導深入中心）。對不起，我以前或者對你們的媒體有少許誤會，但這一次，我沒有誤會。」
「擺得明，你們（《大紀元》）正在陪著我們在往前走」，她說，「我沒有必要去捧一個人，或者一個媒體，我不需要，只是我見到什麼就說什麼。」
她表示，她看到大紀元記者一直走到前線去訪問，看到大紀元記者訪問一些大陸人、教授，「我一路追著你們看，我一直追著，獨立媒體我都沒追過，就一直追著你們《大紀元》，因為我覺得你們走的很前。」
她表示，今天採訪她，她並不覺得高興，因為「我還是一個抗爭者」，「如果朝有一日煲底相見，我脫掉口罩，那才是我快樂的。」



自香港6月9日反送中運動以來，《大紀元》前線記者一直堅守反送中現場，在這近5個月的時間裡，《大紀元》記者見證了港人被殘暴鎮壓的一幕幕現場：
大量的催淚彈煙霧籠罩香港，橡膠子彈、布袋彈、海綿彈亂發，港警暴力毆打抗議者，尤其是港警8·31太子站無差別地暴打乘客，以及7·21元朗白衣凶徒肆無忌憚地襲擊市民，令全球震驚。
港警濫捕，至今至少已抓捕2379人；濫打，很多人被打傷、多人被打到眼睛可能失明，傳多人被打死；海上不時發現浮屍；有人跳樓「自殺」，樓下卻沒有血跡等等這些現象令人懷疑，這些港人是自殺還是他殺？
《大紀元》記者還採訪了不少前線抗議者、專家學者、香港官員議員、社工、明星等。
《大紀元》將上述新聞，通過網絡、電視、報紙、YouTube、Facebook、推特等各種傳媒，把香港反送中運動真相迅速傳遞至國際社會。
中共向香港輸出暴力、利用黑幫治國的手段，肆無顧忌地打壓港人，被《大紀元》及其它獨立媒體報導後，港人奮不顧身地對抗中共、不向中共低頭的行為，不僅感動了港人，也感動了世界各界人士。
美國副總統彭斯（Mike Pence）10月24日發表第二次對華演講時說，「在過去的幾個月中，香港數百萬人一直在和平抗議保護你們的權利，我們與你們站在一起。」

Hong Kong people tears thanks to the Epoch Times: You are accompanying us to go forward

02 Nov 2019, 21:43

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] ""It is you (""The Epoch Times"") that made so many people understand that we are really being suppressed,"" a Hong Kong counter-sentence protester whimpered. Now she understands that ""you are accompanying us to go forward.""
On November 2, Hong Kong people held protests in Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, Causeway Bay and other places to protest against the tyranny of the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Communist Party and called on the international community to support Hong Kong. Because 112 is an international help phone number, Hong Kong people hope that through this activity, other countries can follow the example of the United States and enact the Hong Kong Bill of Rights on Human Rights and Democracy to protect the democracy, freedom and the rule of law that Hong Kong people should have.
A young mother was interviewed by Epoch Times reporters before attending the ""112 Seeking Assistance International and Adhering to Autonomy"" in the Victoria Park near Causeway Bay.
She said: ""The feeling that I gave to the Epoch Times was just an anti-communist media, but this time the Epoch Times is what I admire most.""
""(You) have made so many people understand that we are being suppressed now. My children (children) are very small. His school likes to talk about it: step by step, in fact, we are moving forward step by step."" The protester said.
She said: ""The Epoch Times is very sharp this time (referring to the report to the center). Sorry, I have misunderstood the media before, but this time, I did not misunderstand.""
""It is clear that you (""The Epoch Times"" are accompanying us to go forward,"" she said. ""I don't have to hold a person, or a media. I don't need it. I just say what I see."" ""
She said that she saw the Epoch Times reporters go to the front line to visit and see the Epoch Times reporters visiting some mainlanders and professors. ""I am chasing you all the way. I have been chasing after, I have not chased the independent media. I have been chasing you for the Epoch Times because I think you are going very far.""
She said that she was not happy to interview her today because ""I am still a protester."" ""If I meet one day, I will take off my mask. That is what makes me happy.""



Since Hong Kong’s anti-China campaign on June 9, the front reporters of the Epoch Times have been sticking to the anti-delivery scene. During the past five months, the Epoch Times reporter witnessed the brutal suppression of Hong Kong people. on site:
A large number of tear gas smog enveloped Hong Kong, rubber bullets, bag bombs and sponge bombs were raging. The Hong Kong police violently beat the protesters, especially the Hong Kong Police 8.31 Prince Edward Station beat the passengers indiscriminately, and the 7.21 Yuen Long white murderers attacked the citizens unscrupulously. , shocked the world.
The Hong Kong police have been arrested. At least 2,379 people have been arrested. Indiscriminately, many people have been wounded. Many people have been blinded and may be blind. Many people have been killed. The sea has been found from time to time. Some people have jumped to the building to commit suicide. There are no bloodstains, etc. These phenomena are doubtful. Are these Hong Kong people committing suicide or killing them?
The ""Epoch Times"" reporter also interviewed many frontline protesters, experts and scholars, Hong Kong officials, social workers, stars and so on.
The Epoch Times quickly transmitted the truth about the Hong Kong anti-delivery movement to the international community through various media such as the Internet, television, newspapers, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.
After the CCP exported violence to Hong Kong and used gangs to rule the country, it unscrupulously suppressed Hong Kong people. After being reported by the Epoch Times and other independent media, the Hong Kong people’s unwillingness to confront the CCP and not bow to the CCP did not only touch the port. People have also touched people from all walks of life around the world.
US Vice President Mike Pence said in his second speech to China on October 24, ""In the past few months, millions of people in Hong Kong have been peacefully protesting to protect your rights. We stand with you. Together.""
