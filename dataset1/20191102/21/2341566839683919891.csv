（中央社記者郭芷瑄屏東縣2日電）今天下午墾丁龍磐公園的無動力滑翔機國際公開賽，發生美國隊滑翔機失控墜落砸死一名抱著男童的婦女，男童頸部割傷，恆春警分局表示，全案依過失致死及傷害案偵辦。
恆春警分局表示，這項比賽今天起一連3天在墾丁龍磐公園舉行，各國好手齊聚，今天下午4時許，35歲的林姓婦女抱著2歲男童在龍磐公園的人行棧道欣賞風景，不料一名美籍玩家操控的無動力遙控滑翔機墜落，造成林女當場被砸傷頭部死亡，男童頸部被割傷，送醫發現傷口頗深，但意識清楚。
警方表示，這個活動由台灣斜坡遙控滑翔機協會主辦，向墾丁國家公園管理處申請，美籍玩家及協會理事長已由警方帶回偵辦，全案依過失致死及傷害案偵辦。
林姓婦女的親友表示，來自台南的林女並不是前往觀賞比賽，而是到龍磐公園觀光，在國家公園步道上被砸死，實在冤枉。
由於遙控飛機失事地點離賽事場地超過500公尺，當時也在現場的資深玩家認為，可能是突來的瞬間陣風過強造成，台灣第一次發生這種狀況。
墾丁國家公園管理處長許亞儒表示，這項活動今年是第4次在墾丁龍磐舉辦，申請時，墾管處有要求比賽場地要與人行步道區有區隔，主辦單位應有按照規定，不清楚為何會有失控的情形，造成民眾傷亡，墾管處已要求明、後天的活動停辦。
許亞儒表示，目前主辦單位及肇事的玩家都正由警方釐清出事的原因，未來如果主辦單位無法確保賽事安全，墾管處將不再出借場地。
這項歐洲起源的競賽，台灣的競賽玩家約有100多人，基隆、台東、苗栗後龍、澎湖等地都有飛行場，但擁有落山風及崩崖的龍磐被視為最佳場地。（編輯：陳清芳）1081102
