      <h1>Ethereum May Target $170 in Near-Term as On-Chain Volume Drops 20%</h1>

      <p>Ethereum (ETH) has been caught in a bout of consolidation within the mid-$180 region, which has been largely guided by Bitcoin’s inability to garner any momentum that pushes it away from the lower-$9,000 region, which is where it has been trading for the past several days.</p>
      <p>Now, analysts are noting that ETH may be positioned for a retrace towards $170 in the near-term as it also faces an ongoing decline in on-chain volume.</p>
      <h3>Ethereum Consolidates as Analysts Target a Downside Movement </h3>
      <p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/09/29/analysts-expect-further-upside-for-ethereum-set-near-term-target-at-230/">Ethereum</a> is trading up 2% at its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">current price</a> of $185, which marks a slight climb from its recent lows of $177 that were set last week.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/regulated-eth-futures-not-so-fast">Ethereum</a> has been caught in a trading range between roughly $180 and $190 over the past several weeks, which is largely the result of Bitcoin’s bout of consolidation between $9,000 and $9,500.</p>
      <p>Regardless of how <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/22/prominent-analyst-believes-bitcoin-is-ready-to-target-higher-prices/">Bitcoin</a> trades in the near-term, Ethereum may soon incur a downside movement that takes it as low as $170, which is where its “golden fib ratio” currently exists.</p>
      <p>The Cryptomist, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, explained this possibility in a recent tweet, noting that ETH’s near-term target exists at $176, while its mid-term target exists at $170.</p>
      <blockquote>“$ETH Broken down from rising wedge from last month. Fall is not over in my opinion. Next target is 176 at .5 fib level. I do think we will go to golden ratio at .618 fib at $170,” she explained while pointing to the chart seen below.</blockquote>

      <h3>ETH On-Chain Volume Declines  </h3>
      <p>One factor that could potential perpetuate any downside movement experienced by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/09/the-un-childrens-charity-now-accepts-donations-in-cryptocurrency.html">ETH</a> in the near-term is the fact that its on-chain volume has been declining as of late, which can make all crypto assets more prone to downside movements.</p>
      <p>TokenAnalyst, a popular cryptocurrency analytics group on Twitter, spoke about this in a recent tweet, noting that the cryptocurrency’s on-chain volume has declined nearly 20% over the past 24-hours.</p>
      <blockquote>“24H #ETH Network Stats: Price: $181.82 (-0.5%). $ETH On-Chain Volume: $290M (-18.3%). Active Senders: 238K (+0.5%). Active Recipients: 93K (-4.4%),” they explained.</blockquote>

      <p>As Ethereum’s on-chain volume declines and bulls fail to build any noteworthy strength, it does appear to be a strong possibility that the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/16/ethereum-caught-in-descending-triangle-as-analysts-eye-further-losses/">crypto</a> could decline further before it finds enough buying pressure to propel its price higher.</p>
