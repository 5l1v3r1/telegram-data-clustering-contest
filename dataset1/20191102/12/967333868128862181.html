      <p>A volcano has erupted on Satsumaio island in southeastern Japan, the country's Meteorological Agency says. The eruption occurred around 5:36 p.m, the agency added.</p>
      <p>It has also issued a level 2 warning on a scale of up to 5 after the eruption of the Sakurajima volcano. There have been no reports of damage. The closest locality, inhabited with around 100 people, is 2.5-3 kilometres away from the crater.</p>
      <p>A video of the eruption is available online.</p>

      <p>Sakurajima is said to be the most active volcano in Japan. Formerly an island, it is now a peninsula in the country's Kagoshima Prefecture in Kyushu.</p>
      <p>Over the past years, the level of volcanic activity has considerably risen in Japan. Volcano eruptions occur every year in different parts of the country.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the week, the JMA raised to three level of alert on the Kuchinoerabu-jima Island in Kagoshima Prefecture, due to the possible eruption of the Sindake volcano, which last erupted in 2015.</p>
