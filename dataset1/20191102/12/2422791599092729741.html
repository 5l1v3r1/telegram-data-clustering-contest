      <p>KABUL - An Afghan official says eight children have been killed by a roadside bomb near their school in the northeastern Takhar province.</p>
      <p>Sayed Mehraj Sadat, the provincial police chief, said the victims of Saturday's attack were from 10 to 15 years old.</p>
      <p>He says the bomb's intended target was most likely Afghan security forces, who often use the road.</p>
      <p>No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
      <p>Sadat blames Taliban insurgents who are active in Takhar province, particularly in Darqad district, where the attack took place.</p>
      <p>In October, the Taliban launched large-scale attacks in several districts, including the provincial capital Taluqan, which were repelled by Afghan security forces.</p>
