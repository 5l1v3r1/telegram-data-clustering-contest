        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 2 – Former champions Kabras Rugby Club put up a superb second half display to to see off Mwamba 43-9 at the Railways Club to maintain a perfect start and lead in the 2019/20 Kenya Cup season.</b>

      <p>Mwamba scored two quick penalties to narrow on Kabras’ with Brian Kivasia booting in between the sticks before he added another one to see Kulabu cut Kabras’ lead to a single point.</p>
      <p>However, Kabras dotted a second converted try that guaranteed them a 14-6 lead at the interval.</p>
      <p>On resumption, Kabras restarted on a high, scoring a third converted try before Kulabu responded with a penalty kick that came off an infringement by Kabras.</p>
      <p>Jone Kubu sneaked in a drop goal to extend Kabras’ lead to 24-9 before he was at it again, this time going over after dancing through the Mwamba defense before setting up his support player to land a center post try as he converted it.</p>
      <p>Mwamba were punished for their mistakes when Tony Omondi’s mis-kick resulted in Kabras counter attack and extending their lead to 36-9 following a missed conversion before the Western Kenya based side landed their final try in the match and seal it off with a conversion.</p>
