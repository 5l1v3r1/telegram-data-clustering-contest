Из-за налогового маневра РФ в Беларуси вырастут цены на бензин
Также пострадают НПЗ.

02 Nov 2019, 12:32

Отсутствие компенсации потерь Минска от налогового маневра в нефтяной отрасли России приведет к росту цен на нефтепродукты в Беларуси. Об этом заявил во время «Октябрьского экономического форума» министр финансов Максим Ермолович, сообщает БелТА.
Глава Минфина Максим Ермолович подчеркнул, что налоговый маневр влияет на внешнюю конкурентоспособность и на внутренние цены на нефтепродукты.
Это, по его словам, связанное с маневром наибольшее негативное последствие испытают нефтеперерабатывающие заводы.
Министр также сообщил, что ситуация будет влиять на бюджет, так как возможности страны поддерживать уровень профицита сокращаются. Но, по его мнению, бюджет адаптируется к этим условиям.

Migrants, Italy requests agreement changes. Tripoli: ""Let's see""

02 Nov 2019, 12:39

Italy asks Libya to improve the memorandum on the fight against illegal immigration, Tripoli responds by letting it be known that ""every agreement can be changed, if there is agreement between both parties, but we need to see what is asked of us"" '. ""We must study the requests and then we will decide"", warns Hassan al Houni, media adviser to Libyan premier Fayez Serraj. On the last day to notify a possible denunciation of the agreement signed on February 2, 2017, which is therefore tacitly renewed, government sources have announced that, based on article 3 of the Memorandum, the convocation of the joint Italian-Libyan commission, created for the purpose of ""identifying the priorities for action, identifying the financing instruments, implementing and monitoring the commitments undertaken"". A commission that met regularly throughout 2017 reminds Adnkronos sources close to the dossier. Article 7 of the agreement was then recalled in the verbal note sent by the foreign ministry to the government of Tripoli, under which ""the memorandum may be modified at the request of one of the parties, during the period of its validity"". The objective, the government sources explain, ""is to improve the memorandum on human rights"".
In particular, on the occasion of the commission meeting, which will hopefully take place as soon as possible and will be chaired by the Italian side by Di Maio and by the Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese, it will be asked to allow UNHCR and OIM ""greater vigilance ""on centers for migrants in Libya to ensure better respect for human rights"". ""This is the intention - the sources reiterate - certainly not to report it or cancel it, the memorandum remains valid because it has produced important results, this is the conviction of the government "", aware that without that agreement, the doors would be opened to hundreds of thousands of migrants, as repeatedly stated by the Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio.
In Tripoli, a meeting is scheduled for tomorrow morning to assess Italian requests. ""The government might be in favor of changing the agreement - says Ashraf Shah, former political adviser to the High Council of State - to improve collaboration and work on the issue of respect for human rights. But there is a red line: no politicians Libyan will never accept the creation of hotspots in our country, according to an old proposal that provides for funding from the EU "".
Shah then defends the work of the Libyan Coast Guard. ""He is working well and there is a will to improve his activity, but it must be clear - he says in a reference to the case of Bija, the commander of the Zawiya Coast Guard, who would be involved in the trafficking of migrants - that the individual mistakes they should not be charged in full to the Libyan authorities. They are just people who make you believe you have an official role and then take advantage of the chaos. "" The ""Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation in the field of development, combating illegal immigration, trafficking in human beings, smuggling and strengthening border security"" was signed on 2 February 2017 by the then Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and by the president of the Libyan presidential council Fayez Serraj.
