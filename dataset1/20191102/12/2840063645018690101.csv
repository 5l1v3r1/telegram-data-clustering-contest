02 Nov 2019, 12:15 by Eliana Useche
El censo para vehículos particulares se inicia desde el 11 al 22 de noviembre, mientras que para carga liviana y pesada arranca desde el 25 de noviembre hasta el 7 de diciembre en el estado Táchira, para así gestionar una distribución y un abastecimiento eficiente de la gasolina, informó Nellyver Lugo, vocera del Gabinete del Combustible del Protectorado.
Lugo señaló “Allí vamos a constatar que 100 por ciento de los Tag se le está dando el uso adecuado y correcto, en virtud de las múltiples denuncias y situaciones observadas en las diferentes estaciones de servicio de la entidad”.
“A través del sistema de suministro de combustible (Siscom) también conoceremos con exactitud la flota vehicular que nos lleve a nosotros a sincerar la cantidad de vehículos que hoy tenemos en el estado Táchira de manera activa, la flota que tiene movilidad”, indicó. El censo se realizará en la plaza de toros de la ciudad de San Cristóbal.
Por eso estamos impulsando cómo hacer un censo-auditoría de la municipalización de los servicios públicos, que tiene como objeto tratar que en cada territorio se puedan tomar medidas y acciones dependiendo de las condiciones geoestratégicas de los municipios. “Estamos trabajando todos de manera sincronizada a objeto de tener una respuesta contundente en no más de 90 días”, refirió Lugo.
El sistema de municipalización funciona en siete municipios del Táchira, tales como: Michelena, Junín, Lobatera, Panamericano, Samuel Darío Maldonado, García de Hevia y Cárdenas, aclaró.

Renzi attacks the maneuver, no comment by Conte

02 Nov 2019, 12:57

""Today I dedicated myself to commemorating the dead, among other things I spoke with the parents of the two agents who were killed Rotta and De Menego. No comment even with the staff on the political situation ..."". Thus, at the end of the day, the Prime Minister Conte, at Adnkronos, cutting short the controversy over the maneuver born from the criticisms made by Matteo Renzi. Does the legislature go ahead with Conte premier or even without? For leader Iv, interviewed by 'Il Messaggero', ""it depends on how the government works, not on me. Nothing personal is clear: I care about Italy, not the future of the lawyer Conte"". ""In this maneuver there is some encouraging sign - Renzi wrote on Twitter, summarizing the most relevant passages of his interview - Now we have to eliminate the three main mistakes left: taxes on sugar, plastic and above all on company cars that are a unexplained blow to the middle class "".
Considerations to which, closely, replicated the 5 Star Movement with a post on Facebook: ""We want to say it clearly: there is no future for this legislature if someone tries to question President Conte with palace toys, imagining future scenarios decidedly imaginative "". ""There is a future if we listen to citizens - writes the Movement -. We are working on a maneuver that will give concrete answers to Italians. And we are succeeding because we listen to people. We fail whenever we do not listen to our citizens and start talking"" politichese "". In these days in the budget law we have carried forward the priorities that the Italians had asked us for - the stop to the VAT increase, the confirmation of the 100 quota and the flat tax for VAT, the launch of green investments, the lowering of the tax wedge and the prison for evaders -, because they were fundamental measures to give support to the citizens "".
""This maneuver - continues M5S - that Parliament has the right to improve, was written thanks to a fair and serene confrontation between the political forces that are part of this majority. Loyalty must continue to be the cornerstone of the political action of this government, also through a frank and lively discussion, but which is based on themes and not on palace games. Every so often we find ourselves reading interviews or behind-the-scenes that convey an ambiguous message to the Italians, which is so reminiscent of the First Republic. of the palace, belonging to the old politics, cannot belong to this government "". ""And if someone has strange intentions - the 5S continue - he must know that he will never have the support of the MoVement. We want to say it clearly: there is no future for this legislature if someone tries to question President Conte with palace games, imagining definitely imaginative future scenarios "".
""The same is true even if we continue to weaken this Executive through messages that hurt the country and continually put it in a state of flux. The government is strong if it works together and compact. And we all have to work along the same path, because there are no such things. ""Shortcuts. The agreement on the budget law has been reached by all the political majority forces. Now we go to the goal - it is the conclusion - and we improve the quality of life of the Italians"".
The replica of Dario Franceschini comes from the Democratic Party. ""Repetita iuvant: the Conte Government is the last of this legislature. Those who weaken it with fibrillation, allusions, the backstage of the palace, play the game of the right. Perhaps it would be time to stop,"" the Minister of Culture writes on Twitter.

Calenda vitriol against Renzi: ""Shoot the government you promoted""

Renzi's counter-reply arrives on Twitter: ""Read the comments #RenziMessaggero I repeat: those who want to lower taxes are not against the Government, but do the Government a favor. Who wants to raise them as in the case of company cars, instead gives a gift to Salvini and damage to Italians #ItaliaViva "". ""I reiterate in a simple way. We have made an emergency government that can help the country on many things starting with the reduction of the interest on the debt. And we are talking about tens of billions, not of small change - then writes the leader of Iv on Facebook-. ""On the merits of the budget law we are happy with the results achieved so far. But it is not enough. We will continue to fight in Parliament to further improve the provisions on company cars and micro-boats that hurt the competitiveness of companies. Our proposals are not slogans, but they have coverage: and if there will be numbers in Parliament they will become law. ""Whoever eliminates own goals like the one on company cars is not attacking the Government: he is doing the Government a favor. Instead of maintaining those harmful microtaxes it does not mean giving the Government a gift, but it means giving Salvini a gift - continues Renzi -. limited to saying that we want to cancel taxes on company cars: I also explained how to do it, because the populists speak with slogans, politicians make concrete proposals, politicians do interviews by launching ideas and proposals, the populists comment having only read the headlines "".
