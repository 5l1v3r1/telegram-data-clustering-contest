      <h1>Norris admits McLaren have "a bit of work to do" after up-and-down Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T12:35:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 12:35</time> by <a rel="author">Nicolás Quarles van Ufford</a></address>

        <b>After finishing both sessions on Friday at the Circuit of the Americas well outside the top 10, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> rookie <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lando-norris">Lando Norris</a> has admitted himself and the Woking-based side have their work cut out for them ahead of the rest of the weekend.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 19-year-old finished FP1 down in 18th and FP2 in 14th, although the first session was predominantly used to test out the new tyres for the 2020 season.</p>
      <p>The rookie, who completed FP1 for McLaren at COTA in 2018 when he was still an F2 driver, is coming off the back of a very frustrating weekend in Mexico, where he lost a promising result by a nightmare pitstop which ended up losing him over two minutes.</p>
      <p>At the cold and windy COTA, Norris wasn't overly pleased with his running on Friday, although he does know where and how to improve for the rest of the weekend.</p>

      <p><i>“A tricky day with all the bumps which are worse than last year, making it easy to snatch a front wheel and have a small lock-up," </i>the Brit analysed.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"But after today, we have a direction to push in for tomorrow.</i>

        <i>“We’re there or thereabouts on pace, but it’s very close. So, it’s going to be more about putting the lap together and seeing how we get on, but we’ve got a bit of work to do.”</i>
