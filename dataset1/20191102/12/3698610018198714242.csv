North Atlantic Council did not bring to Ukraine any idea capable of restarting cooperation with NATO - observer
It is not the first time that Western partners sell an old wrap in a new wrapper to Kiev, taking advantage of the fact that neophytes who need loud diplomatic breakthroughs come to power.

Offering political support, the North Atlantic Council did not bring to Kiev any new ideas capable of restarting Ukraine-NATO cooperation. Volodymyr Kravchenko, a columnist for the Department of International Politics, wrote in his article for DT.UA that in Brussels, it seems, they believe that the very fact of the ambassadors' arrival is enough to support our country.
""Stoltenberg and Zelensky mentioned the One Partner - One Plan (OPOP) program, agreed upon at the KUN meeting, is difficult to call a new initiative. Indeed, the format of cooperation, not the first month, discussed in Kyiv and Brussels, in its current form is just a rebranding of the Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAT), ""the author writes.
Kravchenko emphasizes that when the PPC was launched in 2016, he was said to be a new and high-quality form of NATO-Ukraine relationship, that this alliance initiative would bring together advisers and trust funds into one package. And when it comes to OPOP, they repeat almost the same words: the initiative must, under one umbrella, ""coordinate and combine different formats to better focus on the priorities of our work, making them more coordinated and orderly.""
""For the first time, Western partners are not selling the old product in Kiev to the new wrapper, taking advantage of the fact that neophytes come to power, who need loud diplomatic breakthroughs. In fact,"" One partner - one plan ""is another systematization of the old one. there is no common roadmap for adapting to NATO standards, ""Kravchenko warns.
He adds that reducing the number of priorities - from thirteen to five - can be regarded as a minor difference between this format and the PPC (these points are still being determined). Ukraine is currently considering the following five priorities: defense and security sector reform; democratic civilian control; professional military education and development of civilian security and defense professionals; national sustainability system; human-centric security.
""It is planned that, after launching OPOP, the program will be coordinated by Brussels Kozhel, who chaired the NATO Liaison Office in Ukraine a few years ago. It is expected that the One Partner - One Plan initiative will be available not only for Ukraine but for other countries as well. Partners, while the program wants to be rolled out in our country. But if it is progress for other NATO partners, then for Ukraine it is only a repetition of what has passed, ""Kravchenko notes.
If the arguments of OPOP supporters who seek to optimize Ukraine-NATO cooperation can still be understood, then the proposal made by Zelensky to make our country a participant of the Enhanced Capabilities Program (PfP) and thus to reach a new level of cooperation, ""is surprising. the interoperability of the important partners of the alliance is contrary to the policy of Kyiv, which declares Ukraine's joining the alliance, the author emphasizes.
