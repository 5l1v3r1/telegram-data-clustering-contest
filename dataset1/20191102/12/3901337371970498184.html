      <p>The 38-year-old was in fine form for Galaxy in Major League Soccer this season after netting 30 goals in 29 appearances.</p>
      <p>However, the Swedish striker's season came to an end last week at the hands of City rivals Los Angeles FC in the Western Conference semi-finals.</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic has been linked with a return to Spain and Italy, but former United midfielder Paul Ince a return to Manchester could be good for both parties.</p>
      <p>"Zlatan Ibrahimovic seemed to tease going back to Spain, then he’s been linked with staying in the MLS, and even Perth Glory," Ince told Paddy Power.</p>
      <p>"But I think, if he wanted to, returning to Old Trafford would be the way to go.</p>
      <p>"He’d be great at educating all of these young players that Ole is looking to bring through, an incredible off-pitch influence as well as on the field.</p>
      <p>"They need someone who can control the changing room and be a true leader, and he fits that role. He can show the young players how it’s done. He would be the Godfather of United’s dressing room."</p>
