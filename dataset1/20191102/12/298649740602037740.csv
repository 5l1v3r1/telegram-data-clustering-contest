Government, sparks between Renzi and the M5S on the fate of Conte
Former Pd: executive ahead ""with or without him"". The grillini: if it is called into question stop to legislature

02 Nov 2019, 12:23




Rome, 2 November (askanews) - Sparks between Matteo Renzi, leader of Italia VIva and the Star Movement. Triggering the controversy was an interview with the Messaggero in which the former Democratic Party secretary said that ""the government must go ahead, with or without Giuseppe Conte as prime minister"". Words that sound like a sinister warning within the M5S.
""Conte must remain premier?"", Asked the Roman newspaper in Renzi. ""It depends on how the government works, not on me. Nothing personal - he explains - it is clear: I care about Italy, not the future of the lawyer Conte. Conte was the prime minister of a majority that has eliminated growth in Italy: due to a series of circumstances, today the alternative majority is also premier. Some of the allies, which confuse polls with politics, even imagine him as the leading candidate in the next elections. All absolutely legitimate. But I think differently. For me the only concern is that Italy goes ahead, that taxes do not increase, that the country rises again: so I hope that Conte works well. I'm rooting for him and I give him a hand today, without making a film about tomorrow. What Conte has in mind for his future is indifferent to me: just think about working for the good of Italy. The legislature will last until 2023, surely: we are a parliamentary democracy and in Parliament there were, there are and there will be numbers for a government that does not push us out of Europe ”.
""Thinking of pulling the plug on the executive,"" he continues, ""is crazy to me. This government was born in an emergency to respond to the Northern League tear. With the early elections we would have had the increase in VAT, full powers to Salvini, a head of the No Euro state and tensions on the markets. With the August blitz we have eliminated all these risks at once: I claim the institutional hygiene operation we have done. Now we have two objectives: to elect a President of the Republic guaranteeing Italy in Europe in 2022 and use this period of calm in the markets to reduce the cost of interest on the debt. In 2013 we paid 77 billion, next year we will be at 59 billion: if we give stability we can fall below 50 billion in the rest of the legislature. If someone wants to go and vote first, perhaps to replicate the brilliant result of Umbria, where they have chosen to anticipate the vote by making the region a national case, he has only to say it. It is enough then that everyone takes his responsibilities. We are going forward, others will let us know "".
Renzi then rejected the accusation of those who see Italy alive in the front row in criticism of the government's work on the maneuver. ""The opposite! She does not know - she assures - how many times we are silent for a sense of responsibility. On one point, however, we do not compromise: we cannot raise taxes for Italians. We won the battle to eliminate the increase in VAT and now we will also win the one on company cars, plastic and sugar. There are those who claim their own battle No Tav, who the one No Tap. We at Italia Viva are the No Tax ”.
The M5S's response to the words of the leader of Italia Viva is very hard: ""We want to make it clear: there is no future for this legislature if someone tries to question President Conte with palace toys, imagining very imaginative future scenarios. The same is true even if we continue to weaken this executive through messages that are bad for the country and that continually put them in fibrillation, ""says a post on Facebook of the 5-star Movement.
""This maneuver, which the parliament has the right to improve - the post continues - was written thanks to the fair and peaceful confrontation between the political forces that are part of this majority. Loyalty must continue to be the cornerstone of the political action of this government, even through a frank and lively discussion, but based on themes and not on palace games. Every now and then we find ourselves reading interviews or background stories that convey an ambiguous message to the Italians. Which is so reminiscent of the First Republic.
The palace toys, belonging to the old politics, cannot belong to this government. And if someone has strange intentions, he must know that he will never have the support of the MoVement. The government is strong if it works united and compact. And we all have to work the same way, because there are no shortcuts. The agreement on the budget law has been reached by all the majority political forces. Now we go to the goal and improve the quality of life of the Italians "".
""There is a future - concludes the post - if we listen to citizens. We are working on a maneuver that will give concrete answers to Italians. And we are succeeding because we listen to people. We fail every time we don't listen to our citizens and start talking about ""politichese"". In these days in the budget law we have carried forward the priorities that we were asked by the Italians - the stop to the increase in VAT, the confirmation of 100 and the flat tax for VAT, the launch of green investments, the lowering of the tax wedge and the prison for the evaders -, because they were fundamental measures to give support to the citizens ”.
