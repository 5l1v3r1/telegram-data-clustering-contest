      <h1>German city of Dresden declares it has ‘Nazi emergency’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T12:49:40+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 12:49</time> by <a rel="author">Lucia Suarez Sang</a></address>
      <p>A city in eastern <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/germany">Germany</a> has declared a “Nazi emergency” after allegedly experiencing a rise in anti-democratic and far-right extremist views and even violence.</p>
      <p>Council members of the city of Dresden, the capital of Saxony, declared in a resolution that acknowledges that “right-wing extremist attitudes and actions … are occurring with increasing frequency.”</p>
      <p>It also called on the city to help victims of far-right violence, protect minorities and strengthen democracy.</p>
      <p>“'Nazinotstand’ means – similar to the climate emergency – that we have a serious problem. The open democratic society is threatened,” local councilor Max Aschenbach, whose left-leaning satirical party Die Partei sponsored the resolution, told the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50266955">BBC</a>. “The request was an attempt to change that. I also wanted to know what kind of people I’m sitting within the city council of Dresden.”</p>

      <p>The resolution was approved 38 to 29, with Germany’s governing Christian Democrats (CDU) – which has Chancellor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/angela-merkel">Angela Merkel</a> at the helm – among those who rejected it, according to local media.</p>
      <p>The party reportedly described the resolution as “pure political symbolism” and said that the strong wording was a “linguistic error,” German news agency DPA reported.</p>
      <p>The resolution calls on the city and civil society organizations to strengthen democratic culture and to focus on “the causes and consequences of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/anti-semitism">anti-Semitism</a>, racism, and position of extreme right to restore trust in democratic institutions and the appreciation of diversity and respectful solidarity,” according to <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-dresden-declares-nazi-emergency/a-51085539">DW</a>.</p>

      <p>Dresden has long been linked to growing far-right movements in Germany.</p>
      <p>In the early 1990s, neo-Nazi groups began staging rallies in Dresden to remember what they called “the bombing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/holocaust">Holocaust</a>,” according to the BBC.</p>

      <p>The city is also home to the anti-migrant group PEGIDA and the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which received more than 17 percent of the vote in the city council this year.</p>
