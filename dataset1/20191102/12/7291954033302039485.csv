Nicht schön und Föhn
Wochenende bleibt grau, nass und windig

02 Nov 2019, 12:55


Der Herbst zeigt seine ungemütliche Seite. Dem goldenen Oktober folgten frostige Nächte – jetzt kommt das Schmuddelwetter.

Die Temperaturen sind zwar wieder zweistellig, am Alpenrand werden es dank Föhn-Winden sogar um die 20 Grad. Dazu gesellen sich aber dichte graue Wolken, die Regen bringen. Auch am Sonntag und Montag ist es mit zehn Grad im Norden und 16 Grad am Oberrhein relativ mild, aber trüb. Nachts können die Werte auf drei Grad fallen. Es bleibt nass und windig.
Nächste Woche stürmisch

Ab Sonntagabend drohen Stürme, bis Dienstag soll es nass, wechselhaft und stürmisch bleiben. Für Montag erwarten die Meteorologen an der Nordsee und in den Bergen stürmische Böen, auf dem Brocken können sogar schwere Sturmböen auftreten. Erst zur Wochenmitte beruhigt sich der Wind, aber nass bleibt es weiterhin.

dozens of evacuees
Badalona will demolish the shabby building in the La Salut neighborhood
All specialists have agreed that the best decision is to tear down the farm given its dilapidated state
02 Nov 2019, 12:50 by El Periódico
The City Council of Badalona has started this Saturday morning the file for the urgent demolition of the building affected by aluminosis of the neighborhood of La Salut, which has forced the eviction of a hundred residents of the property and another 16 adjoining, as reported by the Mayor of the city, Álex Pastor.
The mayor has announced that two specialized companies are studying how to proceed with the demolition of the property, a demolition that has approved the session after the ""unanimous"" agreement that has been taken at the meeting held in the morning between the town hall, municipal technicians and Bombers de la Generalitat.
Last Monday, the appearance of a large crack in a side wall of the building, located at number 16 of the passage of the Tower, in the neighborhood of Salut de Badalona, forced to evict 42 residents of the building and another six of two adjacent buildings.
The fall on Friday of a wall of the side façade in which the cracks had appeared warned of the imminent risk of collapse of the structure, forcing the residents to be evicted from other 14 farms located around the building, as a preventive measure before an eventual collapse.
Five requirements
Since 2017, the Badalona City Council has sent five requirements to the owners of the building to fix the facade and cracks of the building, which has aluminosis, without these having taken care of the repairs.
Pastor explained after the meeting on Saturday that the two companies that have been charged with the study of the demolition must determine ""how it is articulated and how it is done"", a demolition that has been agreed, stressed the mayor, ""for the safety of the neighbors"" and ""for everyone"".
The two companies will be the ones that will also set the date of the demolition, although Pastor has advanced that it ""will not lengthen too much"".
People who lived in the building will not be able to return to their homes to pick up belongings. There is an ""imminent risk of falling, and therefore it is impossible"" to enter, highlighted the municipal leader, who has described as ""commendable"" and ""impeccable"" the work of municipal services since this case arose. What Pastor did not want is to pronounce on the future of those affected. ""From here [of the demolition announcement], we will see the following screens,"" he said.
Sources of the Bombers of the Generalitat, on the other hand, have specified that the agreement to demolish the property is a municipal competence and that their specialists have not re-entered the building due to the risk it would entail for the troops.
Relocated Neighbors
The 48 neighbors evicted on Monday have been relocated to pensions or apartments provided by the town hall, while those evicted on Friday and not in the homes of family or friends have spent the first night at the Center for Social Emergency and Emergencies in Barcelona ( CUESB).
