      <h1>The incredible Celtic and Rangers blast from the past that proves predictions are a mug's game</h1>
      <h2>Scottish football has become a proving ground for the class of 2001.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T12:33:53+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 12:33</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Predictions, eh? Sometimes best laid plans don't always work out.</p>
      <p>Lovers of the beautiful game loving nothing more than delving deep into the archives and discovering prophecies from yesteryear.</p>
      <p>And a panel of Four Four Two writers are back on the hotseat with their list of the 100 best young players from 2001 being unearthed.</p>
      <p>Supporters have been going over the list with a fine-tooth comb with many noticing the amount of players who turned out to be Championship Manager legends.</p>
      <p>John Welsh, anyone?</p>

      <p>But there's a significant contingent from Scottish football with then <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> pair <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/shaun-maloney">Shaun Maloney</a> and Mark Fotheringham cracking the top 100.</p>
      <p>Maloney would live up to the hype but Fotheringham would fail to make the Parkhead grade before forging a solid career that included sojourns in Germany, Switzerland and Cyprus.</p>
      <p>But the list, in hindsight, shows how many burgeoning talents passed through our game over the years.</p>
      <p>And ceaseless <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jermain-defoe">Jermain Defoe</a>, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers'</a> top scorer in the Premiership this season, made the cut at No.30.</p>
      <p>But there are 12 stars with Scottish connections who earned a place on the list with former Celtic and Germany international Andreas Hinkel (68) also in the mix.</p>
      <p>Former Milan standout Massimo Donati (50) and brief Arsenal loan recruit Jeremie Aliadiere (52) are also on there too.</p>

      <p>Rangers were well represented with Bojan Djordic (69), Niko Kranjcar (45) and now Ibrox women's coach Gregory Vignal (29) all listed.</p>
      <p>But the inclusions aren't limited to Glasgow's big two. The highest rated pair include former Inverness striker Marius Niculae (22) and ex-Dundee United forward Florent Sinama Pongolle (7)</p>
      <p>Fernando Torres comes in at No.4 but he missed out on a top-three finish to Leandro Bonfim, Andres D'Allesandro and Djibril Cisse.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Brazilian legend Kaka had to settle for a 95th-placed finish but the mercurial midfielder didn't let the setback derail his illustrious career.</p>
      <p>But one prediction the experts were miles off on was Michael Chopra - the former Newcastle man who never lived up  to the hype had a one-year stay with Alloa back in 2015.</p>
