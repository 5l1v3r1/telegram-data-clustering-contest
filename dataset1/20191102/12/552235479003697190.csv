Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi insists Thursday's Europa League reunion with Celtic won't be decisive.
The Biancocelesti are in the midst of a tough run of fixtures, and face Milan at San Siro tomorrow before welcoming Neil Lennon 's side to the Stadio Olimpico.
Defeat in the latter fixture would see Lazio eliminated from the Europa League, and the coach was asked if these two games will define the season.
Inzaghi replied: ""No, we're at the start. There are a lot of matches between now and the end.

""They're important though, this is an important run of games.
""Tomorrow we'll face a good team in Milan, with a top coach and a very passionate crowd.""
In the defeat at Celtic Park top-scorer Ciro Immobile was left on the bench, but Inzaghi hinted tomorrow might be when he rotates his squad.
""This is the fifth game in a short space of time, we'll evaluate things tomorrow.
 
""The lads seem to have recovered well but I have some doubts.
""We need to improve our work without the ball, with Ciro (Immobile), (Joaquin) Correa and (Felipe) Caicedo.
""Ciro's numbers speak for themselves but we can do better without the ball.
""Tomorrow we'll have another training session which will clear everything up for me.""
