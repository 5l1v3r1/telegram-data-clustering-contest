Respi datang ke Jembatan Youtefa bersama teman-temannya untuk ber-selfie pada Jumat, 1 November 2019. Nyong Yohanis Sosilo (20), teman Respi, menceritakan Respi sempat memanggil namanya dan meminta tolong sesaat setelah jatuh ke laut di bawah Jembatan Youtefa.
""Kejadian pukul 23.30 WIT tadi malam. Begitu saya dengar bunyi air, Respi sempat teriak nama saya. Dia bilang, 'Anis, tolong.' Setelah itu, hilang suaranya. Tapi handphone yang ia pegang masih nyala. Kelihatan kok dari atas lampu layarnya sebelum mati,"" kata Yohanis, saksi sekaligus teman korban di komunitas Film Maker.
Sesaat sebelum Respi jatuh, Yohanis sempat melarang korban melompat keluar dari pagar jembatan. ""Dia bilang, 'Ah tidak apa-apa. Ada orang juga duduk di luar itu.' Nah, pas dia mau langkah, kan ada celah di bawah pagar, langsung jatuh ke bawah,"" ujar Yohanis.
