      <h1>TD calls for more support for media industry as job losses loom at Virgin Media Ireland</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T12:32:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 12:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>A former communications minister is calling for the government to intervene to prevent more job losses in the media industry.</p>
      <p>Virgin Media Ireland says it may cut 65 jobs across all areas of the company over the next month.</p>
      <p>It is in talks with the staff impacted but says the cuts are necessary to ensure continued growth.</p>
      <p>Independent TD Denis Naughten says the state must stop the decline of the journalism sector.</p>
      <p>"There needs to be a genuine look at how we can actually support news content right across our media," said Deputy Naughten.</p>
      <p>"This is something that as communications minister I started to change by bringing in financial support for local and community radio stations across the country to support news content.</p>
      <p>"But I believe that that support needs to be extended right across our media."</p>
      <p>Mr Naughten said that he is concerned that in any restructuring of any Irish media outlet that current affairs would be among the cuts.</p>
      <p>"I think news content is very important in the Irish media, diversity in the media in Ireland is very important and I hope that that will not be impacted by any restructuring in the company."</p>
