A volcano has erupted on Satsumaio island in southeastern Japan, the country's Meteorological Agency says. The eruption occurred around 5:36 p.m, the agency added.
It has also issued a level 2 warning on a scale of up to 5 after the eruption of the Sakurajima volcano. There have been no reports of damage. The closest locality, inhabited with around 100 people, is 2.5-3 kilometres away from the crater.
A video of the eruption is available online.



Sakurajima is said to be the most active volcano in Japan. Formerly an island, it is now a peninsula in the country's Kagoshima Prefecture in Kyushu.
Over the past years, the level of volcanic activity has considerably risen in Japan. Volcano eruptions occur every year in different parts of the country.
Earlier in the week, the JMA raised to three level of alert on the Kuchinoerabu-jima Island in Kagoshima Prefecture, due to the possible eruption of the Sindake volcano, which last erupted in 2015.
