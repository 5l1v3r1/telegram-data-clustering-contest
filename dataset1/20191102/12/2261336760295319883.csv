The UFC is showcasing a Welterweight bout for the “BMF Title” (Baddest Mother F*cker) in UFC 244’s main event TONIGHT (Sat., November 2, 2019) from inside Madison Square Garden in NYC, New York. The man with the fastest knockout in UFC history, Jorge “Gamebred” Masvidal, takes on The Pride of Stockton, Nate Diaz; who is coming off his decision win over Anthony Pettis at UFC 241. Also on the card, is the #4 ranked Middleweight, Kelvin Gastelum, who will enter the Octagon as a betting favorite against Welterweight Darren ‘The Gorilla’ Till; rounding things out, we will also be treated to the likes of Kevin ‘Motown Phenom’ Lee vs. Gregor ‘The Gift’ Gillespie.

Perhaps to the chagrin of many MMA fans, Diaz has garnered much attention prior to this appearance. He took to social media a few days ago to announce that he had failed a drug test. But it didn’t take long for the USADA and the UFC to reveal that it was a contaminated supplement that caused the failure, thus effectively clearing Diaz to fight this weekend.
