Education, not speed limits, is answer to traffic safety

Re: City seeks public input on push to lower speed limit

The City is considering lowering speed limits on residential roads to reduce pedestrian-involved collisions, injuries and fatalities. Before the city spends millions of dollars on studies and new speed limit signs, it should consider the cause of the issue — unlawful driver behaviour.
Speeding, not using turn signals, failing to fully stop at stop signs, especially if turning right, not yielding the right of way when appropriate, and distracted driving; these dangerous behaviours are common on our roads. Improving driver behaviour through enforcement and (re) education is the solution.
Redirect traffic enforcement into residential areas where the concern for pedestrian safety is greatest. In co-operation with the province, establish traffic law recertification as part of the driver’s licence renewal process to provide drivers with a short traffic law refresher, and as a means to (re) educate drivers on new and important traffic related information.

Hoping for another oil boom is illogical strategy
I quit voting for Conservatives long ago because many of them have to be dragged kicking and screaming into the light on such issues as protecting gay youth or the environment, but also due to their heartless, myopic economic policies.
Yes, fiscal prudence is necessary, however, the only trick the UCP seem to have is cutting services to the most vulnerable while rewarding corporations with tax breaks while hoping for oil prices to go up. Relying solely on a rebound in resource revenue is like those who win the lottery, lose it all and then hope for another win. It is not a logical way to develop long-term stability, as pointed out by many economists.
As for raising taxes by de-indexing benefits — which Kenney opposed federally — for AISH and seniors, if I were to rob the blind and old, people would be rightly appalled, but bury such theft in an omnibus bill, no one cares.

‘Demonized’ energy players head for friendlier climes
At $50 USD a barrel, the large oil companies have no problem making money. When the prices were ridiculous, a lot of small players got into the game and, when prices crashed, they abandoned wells. We don’t need those types around.
There have been billions of dollars invested in oil and gas development elsewhere in the last several years (particularly in the U.S.) while investment has fled from Canada. Some corporations divested themselves from Alberta during the NDP reign and were reluctant to invest new money as well. The sad part is companies spent that money elsewhere and those dollars are gone.
The real cause of our economic woes is homegrown. What company would risk investment in a country (or province) where those very corporations are publicly demonized by more than one party or level of government? What company would invest in an industry that is open to constant court challenges and no progress has been made on projects started years ago? Where some of the public are vocally against pipelines or the industry as a whole? When there are more friendly places to invest and projects are not hamstrung (legally or socially), the money will go there.

Táchira will start census for cars and trucks
02 Nov 2019, 12:15 by Eliana Useche
The census for private vehicles starts from November 11 to 22, while for light and heavy cargo starts from November 25 to December 7 in the state of Táchira, in order to manage an efficient distribution and supply of gasoline , said Nellyver Lugo, spokeswoman for the Protectorate Fuel Cabinet.
Lugo said ""There we will verify that 100 percent of the Tag is being used properly and correctly, by virtue of the multiple complaints and situations observed in the different service stations of the entity.""
""Through the fuel supply system (Siscom) we will also know exactly the vehicle fleet that will take us to honestly the number of vehicles that we currently have in the state of Táchira, the fleet that has mobility,"" he said. The census will be carried out in the bullring of the city of San Cristóbal.
That is why we are promoting how to conduct a census-audit of the municipalization of public services, which aims to try to take measures and actions in each territory depending on the geostrategic conditions of the municipalities. ""We are all working synchronously in order to have a strong response in no more than 90 days,"" Lugo said.
The municipalization system operates in seven municipalities of Táchira, such as: Michelena, Junín, Lobatera, Panamericano, Samuel Darío Maldonado, García de Hevia and Cárdenas, he said.
