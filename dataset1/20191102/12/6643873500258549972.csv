Debate: - Science is not as infallible as BT thinks
Not so stupid to believe.

In the leadership position, BT worries about what could happen if some pupils in the Norwegian school were to receive teaching that could complement the Darwinian developmental theory. Under the title ""Even shipowners are related to the monkeys"" (BT Oct. 25), the newspaper describes how bad things can go if students are told that ""the world is too advanced, together, that it may have happened by itself. »
The BT leader concludes that ""when people's view of life demands to take the place of science, it can go very wrong."" to the theory of evolution ». According to BT, this would be to ""replace science with undocumented claims"".

Reality is not that simple. First, science is not as infallible, or divine, as BT's leader portrays it. Secondly, it is probably not as unscientific to believe in a creator and God as BT would want it to be.
Among the believers in the world, there are many scientists - including representatives from the natural sciences. From history we can name well-known names such as Newton, Kelvin and Pasteur.
In our day, too, there are many. One of them is Francis S. Collins, who was previously the leader of The Human Genome Project, the project that aims to map the entire human DNA material. Among other things, through the research projects he is part of, he has become convinced that there must be a designer behind everything that is created.
BT's leader goes a long way in suggesting that he and others who think in the same trajectory must be placed in category with shaman Durek. Such a comparison, with respect to reporting, does not seem very intelligent.
Collins began his scientific career as an atheist. One day, however, he realized that he had broken one of the most important principles of science in the question of whether there is a God or not. He had concluded without examining the evidence. From then on he began the painstaking work of checking.
He thought the journey would result in his being strengthened in his atheism. Instead, it ended in a strong belief that there must be a creator. Many of his discoveries are included in the book ""The Language of God - A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief,"" which leadership writers and others must read.
We agree with BT that students should be trained in source criticism and critical thinking. In addition, both school students and others must be allowed to wonder about the life and complexity of the world we are a part of.
There is much in life that we cannot measure by the scientific methods we know today. The origin of life is also a mystery. Here, a belief in God can complement science, not necessarily contradict it. Maybe we all, like Collins, should look into the evidence a little more before drawing too bumpy conclusions.
