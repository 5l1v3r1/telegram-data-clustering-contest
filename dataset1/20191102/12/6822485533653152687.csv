Хубавото време у нас отлага грипната вълна

02 Nov 2019, 12:31

""Хубавото време, на което ще се радваме поне още две седмици, отлага грипа. "" - това каза в ефира на bTV проф. Тодор Кантарджиев, директор на Националния център по заразни и паразитни болести.
Около 60 хил. безплатни ваксини срещу очакваните грипни щамове, предназначени пенсионерите, вече са разпределени, но повечето от тях са за района на София. За останалата част от страната се очаква да бъдат доставени след средата на ноември.
Те ще стигнат за около 10% от възрастните граждани над 65 години и ще се разпределят по усмотрение на общопрактикуващите лекари.
"" Осигуряването на безплатни ваксини за поне 10% от най-възрастните е добро начало"" , коментира проф. Канатарджиев. Той призова още безплатните ваксини да се поставят максимално бързо, след като бъдат доставени. Важно е също да се поставят на здрави хора. Епидемиологът напомни, че в търговската мрежа вече има налични достатъчно ваксини за този зимен сезон.
Проф. Катранджиев добави, че са нужни поне 21 дни на организма, за да изгради защита срещу върлуващите грипните щамове.
"" Пикът на грипа през последните години е в третата седмица на януари и това означава, че е хубаво до декември ваксините да са поставени"" , каза епидемиологът.
Той е категоричен, че в момента у нас грип няма. ""Хората с хрема и кашлица в момента са с риновируси, които се разпространяват от мръсните ръце"", уточни проф. Кантарджиев.
