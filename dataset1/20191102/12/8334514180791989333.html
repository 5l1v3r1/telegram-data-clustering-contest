      <p>MILAN (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/FCHA.MI">FCHA.MI</a>) and Peugeot owner PSA (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/PEUP.PA">PEUP.PA</a>) aim to sign a final merger agreement as early as the beginning of next month, a source familiar with the matter said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The two automakers said earlier this week they planned to join forces in a 50-50 share merger to create the world’s fourth-largest automaker, seeking scale to cope with costly new technologies and slowing global demand.</p>
      <p>They said they aimed to reach a binding deal on the $50 billion merger “in the coming weeks”.</p>
      <p>The source said the two groups were at work to finalize all the merger details and they hoped to sign a binding memorandum of understanding in “three-four weeks”.</p>
      <p>“This means the final agreement should be signed by early December, or by Christmas at the latest,” the source said, confirming a report published earlier on Saturday in La Stampa daily newspaper.</p>
