Indian Idol row: Singer Sona Mohapatra drags Sachin Tendulkar one more time, asks Anand Mahindra for praising contestant
02 Nov 2019, 12:21 by JKR Staff
Singer Sona Mohapatra has once again targeted cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar and industrialist Anand Mahindra days after she took her #MeToo fight against Sony TV global. In her latest social post, Sona also accused Sony TV of using the public praise for Indian Idol contestants by Tendulkar and Mahindra for PR exercise. She asked both the public icons to take a stand ‘on the right side of history.’



In her latest tweet, Sona wrote that a troll army had been unleashed on her for questioning Tendulkar’s decision to praise Indian Idol contestants in light of Sony TV hiring a MeToo accused judge, Anu Malik. She wrote, “I am experiencing a troll army that has been unleashed by diverting the issue at hand-reinstating a sexual offender as judge on National TV to me supposedly ‘lashing’ out at Sachin Tendulkar for praising ‘bechara lachar’ contestants & making this ‘news’.Sony TV, PR machinery I C U.”





Sona had earlier tweeted about Tendulkar and Mahindra, “Thank you for stating this right @ETPanache that I am only asking for India’s icons to take a stand on the right side of history. So many have gleefully made clickbait & ‘troll invitation’ headlines of me ‘lashing out’ at @sachin_rt , which is so off the mark & untrue. 🧚🏿‍♀️🙏🏾”





The singer, however, did not react kindly to reports accusing her of lashing out at Tendulkar and Mahindra. She wrote, “Yes, the context is actually missing, for U. A powerful conglomerate like Sony TV is trying to divert the shameful reinstating of a multiple accused sexual offender,Anu Malik as a judge on #IndianIdol by publicising @sachin_rt & @anandmahindra‘s praise & riding on their goodwill.”
Last week, Sona had asked Tendulkar if he was even aware’ of the MeToo stories of Indian women including ‘some minors who came forward in the public domain about Anu Malik.’ “Does their trauma not matter or touch anyone?” she had asked Tendulkar.
Sona’s extraordinary attack against Tendulkar, who’s regarded as the God of Cricket in India, came after Neha Bhasin alleged in a social media post that Anu Malik had once made sexual advances towards her. Responding to Sona’s criticism for Sony to hire someone accused of sexual predatory as one of its judges, Neha had written, “I agee with you. We do live in a very sexist world. Anu Malik is a predator, I too have run away from his strange moves when I was 21. I didn’t let myself get into a sticky situation beyond him lying on a sofa in front of me talking about my eyes in a studio. I fleed lying.”
Tendulkar had recently taken to Twitter to publicly admit that he was moved by the heart-wrenching stories of struggle of four contestants. Tendulkar had revealed how he had been touched by the soulful singing and ‘life-stories’ of four Indian Idol singers namely Rahul Khare, Chelsi Behura, Diwas Kumar and Sunny.
