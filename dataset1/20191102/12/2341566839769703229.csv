北市1選區三女對決 藍綠都有分裂危機

2020立委選戰（中央社記者王揚宇、蘇龍麒台北2日電）2020立委選舉，台北市第1選區（北投、士林）呈現三女對決，但第三勢力也加入搶食票源，除了綠營選票瓜分外，藍營也有潛在分裂危機，戰局詭譎多變，堪稱為選情激烈的一級戰區。
根據中央選舉委員會資料，台北市第1選區立委在西元2008年、2012年，都由國民黨丁守中以平均近58%的得票率拿下；到了2016年，整體形勢對民進黨有利，當時代表民進黨出征的市議員吳思瑤，以50.81%的得票率擊敗尋求連任的丁守中，藍天變綠地。
2020立委選舉，吳思瑤尋求連任，碰上的國民黨對手是在地擔任5屆市議員的汪志冰。
觀察這個選區的選民結構，綠營地方人士認為，北投區為五五波，士林的天母地區13里則是藍大於綠。吳思瑤長期耕耘教育文化議題，形象好、問政專業、親和力夠，獲得不少中間選民認同，但這次選戰面臨綠營出身的前新北市議員李婉鈺競爭，恐陷入苦戰。
除了李婉鈺外，泛綠陣營的一邊一國行動黨也推出曾任柯文哲競選辦公室主任的蕭亞譚參戰，外傳民眾黨也可能推出曾是民進黨籍市議員的台北市花卉公司副董事長呂瀅瀅，綠營票源面臨瓜分危機。
至於國民黨部分，汪志冰是資深議員，在眷村經營著力甚深，基層實力扎實，加上選民結構有利，被藍營期待能收復失土，但目前遇到最大的變數與挑戰，就是同區5連霸的新黨市議員潘懷宗是否會參選。
潘懷宗耕耘地方多年，基層實力雄厚，加上經常在媒體曝光，知名度高，在初選民調僅以不到1%的支持度輸給汪志冰，儘管目前尚無動作，但傳出新黨積極勸進出馬協助新黨衝政黨票，一旦潘懷宗參選，將衝擊汪志冰得票。（編輯：郭萍英）1081102

It can be called a first-class theater with intense elections.

By 2016, the overall situation was beneficial to the DPP. Wu Siyao, a member of the DPP's city council, defeated Ding Shouzhong, who sought re-election, with 50.81% of the votes, and the blue sky turned green.
In the 2020 legislature election, Wu Silao sought re-election, and the Kuomintang opponent who met the local government was Wang Zhibing, who served as a member of the 5th city council.
Observing the electorate structure of this constituency, the local people in the green camp believe that the Beitou District is five or five waves, and the 13th of the Tianmu area of Shilin is blue and green. Wu Silao has long cultivated the educational and cultural issues, with good image, professional politics, and affinity. He has won the recognition of many middle-ranking voters. However, this election is facing the competition of former New Taipei City Councilman Li Wei, who is born in the Green Camp.
In addition to Li Wei, the side of the pan-green camp, the National Action Party, also launched Xiao Yatam, who served as the director of Ke Wenzhe's campaign office. The rumored popular party may also introduce Lu Wei, the vice chairman of the Taipei Flower Company, who was a member of the Democratic Progressive Party. The green camp ticket source is facing a crisis.
As for the Kuomintang part, Wang Zhibing is a senior member of the Diet. He has a strong management in the village, a solid foundation at the grassroots level, and a favorable voter structure. He is expected to recover the lost land, but the biggest variable and challenge is the same. Whether Pan Huai, a new party member of the company, will run for the election.
Pan Huaizong has been working in the local area for many years, and the grassroots strength is strong. In addition, he is often exposed in the media and has a high reputation. In the primary poll, he lost to Wang Zhibing with less than 1% support. Although there is no action yet, the new party actively persuaded The horse will help the new party to rush to party votes. Once Pan Huaizong is elected, it will hit Wang Zhibing. (Editor: Guo Pingying) 1081102
