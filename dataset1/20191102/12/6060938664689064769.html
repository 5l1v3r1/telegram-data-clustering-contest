      <p>As the King of Hearts, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shah-Rukh-Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a> turned a year sexier today, a sea of fans flocked to Mannat to kick off the celebrations at the stroke of midnight and to wish their favourite star on his birthday.</p>
      <p>Fans of the superstar were in for a double treat as SRK, made his second appearance this evening, this time around with his son <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/AbRam-Khan">AbRam Khan</a>. From waving out to giving them the thumbs up and even striking his trademark pose, Shah Rukh had all his fans on cloud nine and made the long wait seem worth the while.</p>

      <p>Dressed in a simple white tee and jeans, Shah Rukh stepped up on his pedestal with his youngest son, AbRam looking all grown up in a new short spike hairdo. What made the annual tradition even more special was the little cutie joining in and mimicking his dad by waving to crowd gathered outside their residence.</p>

      <p>Last seen in 'Zero', the actor is expected to announce his next film venture.</p>
