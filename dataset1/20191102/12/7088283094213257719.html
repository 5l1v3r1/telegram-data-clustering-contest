        <b>Some 600 Yellow Vest protest organisers from across France have gathered in Montpellier for a national assembly to debate the future of their movement.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The gathering in the southern French city goes on until Sunday and comes ahead of the first anniversary of the protests on 17 November.</p>
      <p>"We need to do something that stands out to mark the date," said Fabienne, a delegate from Grenoble who like others attending gave only her first name to reporters.</p>
      <p>Jacques, from Lille, said the assembly "shows the extent of the <a href="http://en.rfi.fr/tag/yellow-vests/">Yellow Vest </a>movement".</p>
      <p>Some 200 delegations are due at the assembly. It includes a series of workshops to discuss issues such as how to respond to <a href="http://en.rfi.fr/europe/20190929-yellow-vest-protests-toulouse-broken-water-cannons">heavy-handed police tactics </a>or how to work with other protest movements.</p>

      <p>"We started out amid heavy repression, with a sense of urgency to solve problems. Now is the time for longer-term work on a solid base," said Christophe Chapuis, the assembly's designated spokesperson.</p>
      <p>French President Emmanuel Macron was caught out by the Yellow Vest protests when they started last year, as protesters accused him of ignoring the day-to-day struggles of ordinary French people. </p>
      <p><a href="http://en.rfi.fr/france/20190427-Yellow-Vests-protests-24-trade-unions-cgt-macron-strasburg">The numbers have dropped</a> well below the initial protest in November last year, which brought out more than 280,000 people across France.</p>
      <p>But a dedicated group of activists are maintaining the Saturday demonstrations in cities around France, arguing that Macron is still ignoring the needs of marginalised groups such as the working poor.</p>
