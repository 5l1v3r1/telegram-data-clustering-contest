      <h2>The Hoops face the Serie A giants on Thursday.</h2>

      <p>Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi insists Thursday's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> reunion with Celtic won't be decisive.</p>
      <p>The <i>Biancocelesti</i> are in the midst of a tough run of fixtures, and face Milan at San Siro tomorrow before welcoming <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> 's side to the Stadio Olimpico.</p>
      <p>Defeat in the latter fixture would see <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lazio">Lazio</a> eliminated from the Europa League, and the coach was asked if these two games will define the season.</p>
      <p>Inzaghi replied: "No, we're at the start. There are a lot of matches between now and the end.</p>

      <p>"They're important though, this is an important run of games.</p>
      <p>"Tomorrow we'll face a good team in Milan, with a top coach and a very passionate crowd."</p>
      <p>In the defeat at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-park">Celtic Park</a> top-scorer Ciro Immobile was left on the bench, but Inzaghi hinted tomorrow might be when he rotates his squad.</p>
      <p>"This is the fifth game in a short space of time, we'll evaluate things tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>"The lads seem to have recovered well but I have some doubts.</p>
      <p>"We need to improve our work without the ball, with Ciro (Immobile), (Joaquin) Correa and (Felipe) Caicedo.</p>
      <p>"Ciro's numbers speak for themselves but we can do better without the ball.</p>
      <p>"Tomorrow we'll have another training session which will clear everything up for me."</p>
