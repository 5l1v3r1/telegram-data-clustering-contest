冷凍貨櫃39屍命案　英警改口：死者全是越南人
02 Nov 2019, 06:22 by 黃雅琪
英國上月23日驚爆冷凍貨櫃39屍慘案，原警方研判死者皆為「中國籍」，讓中國官媒《環球網》跳腳要英國負責任，不過近日英國警方改口稱證實全部為越南籍，目前越南外交部也積極與英國配合調查。
被英國媒體稱為「鐵棺材」的冷凍貨櫃由比利時濟布魯治港口出發，跨海抵達英國艾塞克斯的泰晤士河港口柏佛利特，23日凌晨司機發現貨櫃內的屍體後報警，警方調查後發現39人原想偷渡到英國，卻在車內被凍死，死者為31名男性、8名女性，其中包含1名青少年。
由於受害者攜帶的證件極少，不易辨識身分，一度傳出死者全為中國籍，但經過調查後發現恐是越南籍人士使用偽造的中國護照，目前警方朝向越南社群追查死者身分，利用指紋、DNA，以及刺青、疤痕等特徵來辨別身分，近日在持續調查後證實死者全為來自越南；另外越南方面，已有多個家庭向當局通報，懷疑家人在英國失蹤。
綜合外媒報導，助理警察局長史密斯（Tim Smith）表示：「現階段我們認為所有受害者都是越南公民，並和越南政府保持密切聯繫。」但他表示，目前無法證實任何一名受害者的身分。越南外交部副部長表示，共有14個來自義安省的家庭及10個來自河靜省的家庭向當地政府通報，警方已向失聯者家屬採集DNA，將送鑑定比對，以辨識死者身分。

越南當局昨（1日）證實，河靜省已逮捕涉及人蛇仲介偷渡的2名嫌疑人。此外，先前傳出來自越南河靜省的26歲女子范氏茶眉（Pham Thi Tra My）曾用手機傳訊息給父母交代遺言，內容提到她的出國之路失敗，且自己不能呼吸，隨後失聯，家屬認為范女遺體就在該貨櫃之中。
