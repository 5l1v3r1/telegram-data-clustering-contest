公視劇集《苦力》劇中初期的大反派，找來黃玉榮演出個性狡詐的黑道大哥「馬沙」，他最大的挑戰在於，從一開始意氣風發的大哥，被仇家吳鈴山報復「去勢」後，變成一個苟延殘喘、被毒品控制的皮條客，甚至只能眼睜睜看著自己的女人吳婉君被人糟蹋，連最後一點的尊嚴都沒了，「那種內心煎熬跟轉變真的太痛苦了，加上酒癮、毒癮不時發作，是我拍戲以來演過最淒慘的角色。」

黃玉榮這場重要的「去勢」轉折戲，起因於當年礦災發生後，他為逃避法律責任，命令礦場手下「陳榮貴」吳鈴山頂罪入獄，多年後，吳鈴山搖身一變成了心狠手辣的黑道大哥，為報家破人亡之仇，回頭找上黃玉榮報復，吳鈴山表示：「玉榮下半身只圍著一條浴巾，他上身光溜溜的先是被我敲暈倒臥在地，我穿著皮鞋踢他，最後再用武士刀撩開浴巾，狠狠將他『斷根』，拍攝時真的很擔心他會受傷，所以過程中我力道拿捏得特別小心，深怕一個不小心弄假成真。」

問及演出「被去勢」的困難點，黃玉榮說：「應該是被切掉後要怎麼走路吧？」因為全劇組上下實在沒有人有這方面的經驗可以提供他參考。另一場戲，吳婉君幫黃玉榮的傷口換藥，黃玉榮坦言，這是我頭一次要在鏡頭前，對著一個女生把腳張開開，當下實在是太害羞了。吳婉君笑回：「真的要慶幸我們很熟，不然幫他換藥包紮的那幾場戲也太難演了，多像要幫他接生啊！」

劇中黃玉榮與吳婉君成了患難鴛鴦，兩人從前就演過情侶、兄妹，私下交情深厚。戲裡吳婉君情路坎坷，曾因酒家女身份曝光，自卑無法與黃文星相守，最後只好回到黃玉榮身邊，怎知好景不常，仇家吳鈴山找上門後，她被迫獻身，最後更為了維持生計，上街當流鶯拉客討生活。而「美雪」的人生是否還有機會翻身？吳婉君表示不到最後請大家千萬別放棄，一定要鎖定收看。

The male star was retaliated by the ""castration"" leg to let his girlfriend take care of the smile.
02 Nov 2019, 06:29 by Liang Xinqiao
The big villain in the early drama drama ""The Coolies"" drama, Huang Yurong was shown to be a black-handed big brother ""Masha"". His biggest challenge was that the big brother who was from the beginning was retaliated by the enemy Wu Lingshan. It became a pimp who was lingering and controlled by drugs. Even the woman who looked at her own, Wu Yijun, was ruined. Even the last dignity was gone. ""It’s really painful to have the heart and the transformation, plus Alcohol addiction and drug addiction have occurred from time to time. It is the most miserable role I have ever played since I filmed.""





Wu Lingshan (Right 2) In the heavy rain, he is ready to use the knife to ""casten"" Huang Yurong (falling to the ground). When shooting, he is particularly careful to fear that he is injured. (provided by public view)

Huang Yurong’s important ""castration"" turning point was caused by the fact that after the mine disaster occurred, he plundered the legal responsibility and ordered the mine to ""Chen Ronggui"" Wu Ling’s top sin. After many years, Wu Lingshan turned into a heart-wrenching underworld brother. For the revenge of the newspaper, he turned back to Huang Yurong for revenge. Wu Lingshan said: ""Yu Rong is only surrounded by a bath towel. His upper body is first stunned by me, and I am kicking him in leather shoes. Finally, I will kick him in leather shoes. I opened the bath towel with a samurai sword and smashed him. When I was shooting, I was really worried that he would be injured. Therefore, I was very careful in the process, and I was afraid that I would accidentally make a mistake.""


Huang Yurong (right) was devastated by the ""castration"", and the murderer Wu Lingshan (left) was deliberately visiting the hospital. (provided by public view)

Asked about the difficulty of the performance of ""being castrated"", Huang Yurong said: ""How should we walk after being cut off?"" Because no one in the whole crew has any experience in this area can provide him with reference. In another scene, Wu Yujun helped Huang Yurong's wound dressing change. Huang Yurong said frankly that this was the first time I had to open the foot of a girl in front of the camera. It was too shy at the moment. Wu Yijun laughed back: ""I really want to be glad that we are very familiar. Otherwise, the scenes that helped him change the dressing are too difficult to play. It is like helping him deliver the baby!""


Wu Yujun changed the medicine for the important part of Huang Yurong, and he was ""in the process of delivery."" (provided by public view)

In the play, Huang Yurong and Wu Yujun became troubled. The two had played couples, brothers and sisters in the past, and they had a deep friendship. In the play, Wu Yujun’s feelings were bumpy. She was exposed to the identity of the female family. Her inferiority could not be with Huang Wenxing. In the end, she had to go back to Huang Yurong. How could she know that the good scenery was not common? After the enemy Wu Lingshan came to the door, she was forced to dedicate herself and finally maintained Livelihood, when you go to the streets, you are going to talk to you. And is there a chance to turn over in the life of ""Mei Xue""? Wu Yujun said that in the end, please don't give up, you must lock it.
