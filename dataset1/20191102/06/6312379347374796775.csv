SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The European Union said that China should make rapid and substantial improvements to the business environment or risk “promise fatigue.”

The comments from the European Union Beijing mission come ahead of China’s massive week-long import fair in Shanghai next week, an attempt by the country to showcase its free trade credentials.
China has long been dogged by allegations of unfair trade practices, from forced tech transfers to protectionist market entry policy. The country has been criticized for making promises to open its market and not delivering on them.
The EU said in the statement late on Friday that European firms had provided positive feedback on the China International Import Expo (CIIE) last year and had increased sales or met new potential buyers.
But more needs to be done in connection to the EU-China Comprehensive Investment Agreement, said the statement.
The EU “urges China to show more ambition and genuine effort towards rebalancing and level playing field,” it added.
The EU said it would be closely monitoring China’s roll out of its corporate social credit system and its impact on European companies and is concerned about the “wide scope, vague nature and lack of clear criteria of many of the key provisions”.
Beijing has been developing a plan to give “social credit” scores to reward or punish individuals and corporations using technology to record various measures of financial credit, personal behavior and corporate misdeeds.
The key market access barriers the EU would like to see removed include restrictions on foreign direct investment, subsidies granted to state-owned enterprises, forced transfer of technology and “buy China” policy for central and local governments.
The EU would like China to reduce barriers resulting from China’s cyber security schemes, particularly with respect to cryptography, virtual private network usage, cross border data transfer and localization requirements.

Malaysian Prime Minister said that the country is ready to buy planes from the Russian Federation

02 Nov 2019, 06:52

Malaysia is ready to buy aircraft from Russia, while refusing to buy from European manufacturers because of plans to limit palm oil exports, said Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad at the ASEAN summit.
""If you reduce or limit our imports, then we will take the same measures and will not buy your goods,"" he said, adding that in this case, Malaysia will purchase Russian aircraft.
As the prime minister noted, ASEAN has a very large market and does not want trade wars, but the Association is ready to respond to any negative steps in its direction.
""You are reducing our imports, we will do the same,"" the head of government explained and urged the other member countries to ""act as a united front"" and express their position together, because, as he said, if you want to be heard and heard, "" you have to be very rich or very strong. ""
In January last year, the European Parliament approved measures aimed at reforming the energy market in order to reduce energy consumption and save the climate. Among the measures - a ban on the use in the production of biofuels of palm oil, the producer of which is Malaysia, the second after Indonesia.
