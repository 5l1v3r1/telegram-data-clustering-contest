02 Nov 2019, 06:09 by Sabina Chrispine Nabigambo

Wanajeshi wa Uturuki na Urusi wameanza kufanya doria ya pamoja kukagua ikiwa wapiganaji wa Kikurdi wameondoka kwenye maeneo muhimu ya mpakani hatua ambayo ni sehemu ya utekelezaji wa makubaliano yaliyofikiwa baina ya nchi hizo mbili.

Doria hiyo ambayo ilianza jana asubuhi, imekuja baada ya makubaliano ya juma lililopita kwenye mji wa Sochi, ambapo nchi hizo mbili zilikubaliana kuwa wapiganaji wa Kikurdi waondoke kwenye maeneo ya mpaka na Uturuki, ambapo Urusi imethibitisha kuondoka kwao.
Vikosi hivi vinaungana na wanajeshi wengine wa Marekani ambao juma lililopita rais wa Marekani Donald Trump aliagiza wanajeshi wake kusalia kulinda miundombinu ya mafuta.
Taarifa ya pamoja iliyotolewa na wizara ya ulinzi ya Ankara, imethibitisha kuondoka kwa wapiganaji hao na kuongeza kuwa doria hiyo itaendelea kwa majuma kadhaa ili kuhakikisha makubaliano yaliyofikiwa hayakiukwi.

Turkey and Russia begin joint patrols in Syria
02 Nov 2019, 06:09 by Sabina Chrispine Nabigambo

Turkish and Russian troops have begun joint patrols to check if Kurdish fighters have moved out of key border areas which is part of the implementation of the agreement reached between the two countries.

The march, which started yesterday morning, came after last week's agreement in the city of Sochi, where the two countries agreed to allow Kurdish fighters to leave border areas with Turkey, where Russia has confirmed their departure.
These forces are joining forces with other US troops who last week US president Donald Trump ordered his troops to remain in defense of oil infrastructure.
A joint statement issued by the Ankara defense ministry confirmed the departure of the militants and added that the patrol would continue for several weeks to ensure that the agreement reached was not violated.
