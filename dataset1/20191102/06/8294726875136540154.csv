02 Nov 2019, 06:48 by IANS
PARIS: India's top doubles player Rohan Bopanna, along with his partner Denis Shapovalov of Canada, bowed out of the Paris Masters after a hard-fought defeat against the Russian duo of Karen Khachanov and Andrey Rublov in the quarter-finals.
On Friday evening, Bopanna-Shapovalov went down fighting 5-7, 7-6, 8-10 against the Russian duo in a match that lasted over 80 minutes to exit the ATP Masters 1000 tournament.
The Indian-Canadian pair fired 10 aces and committed three double faults throughout the course of the match. They also saved four out of seven break points and won two of two but still emerged on the losing side at the end of the match.
Bopanna and Shapovalov had earlier defeated the American-Argentine pair of Manuel Gonzalez and Austin Krajicek in their Round of 16 match. Before that they had got the better of Benoit Paire and Fernando Verdasco to move into the pre-quarters.
Khachanov and Rublov will now face the Slovakian-Croatian pair of Filip Polasek and Ivan Dodig for a place in the final.

Russian surprise!
Lada Vesta Sport - how much it costs and how well the Russian performance model has
02 Nov 2019, 06:27 by Bogdan Barliga













































With the exception of the famous Lada Niva model in Europe, not much is known about cars produced in Russia. This also contributes to the fact that the Russians are not too interested in adhering to increasingly restrictive pollution rules, nor do they have the financial strength to compete with the big European producers.

But that does not mean that we can not find something interesting in the range produced by Lada. In addition to the model based on Logan and sold in Russia with the name of Largus on offer, the models Granta, Vesta, Xray and Niva appear.


Lada Vesta Sport - how much it costs and how well the Russian performance model has


Unlike Dacia, which offers no performance model, Russian buyers are tempted by a performance version based on the Vesta series model.
The Lesta Vesta Sport has a lower weight than the normal model, an exterior kit with an emphasis on sportsmanship and a modified suspension. The ground clearance is reduced by 31 mm and the gauge has been enlarged. It offers standard 17-inch wheels with low profile tires, sports seats and perforated leather steering wheel and others.
Under the hood we have a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine, which produces 145 hp and 184 Nm operated through a five-speed manual gearbox. The normal version Vesta is equipped with a 1.6 liter engine and 106 hp.
The Lesta Vesta Sport has front-wheel drive and can accelerate from one to 100 km / h in 9.6 seconds, and the top speed is 193 km / h! We might smile here if we think about the performance of a Duster TCe 150, but let's not forget that Vesta Sport has a chassis developed by the Lada motorsport division with relevant presence in the World Touring Car Championship and could cope quite well on the track.
Inside we have standard air conditioning system, heated windscreen, cruise control, multifunction steering wheel, heated front seats, rain / light sensors. Optionally you can order a multimedia package that includes navigation and a rear video camera.
Lada Vesta Sport is sold in Russia for about 13,000 euros. Officially it is not possible to order in Romania because Lada is not directly represented, but orders can be placed to the car dealers who import the Russian range. Basically you can buy a new Lada model, but because it does not meet current pollution standards it can only be sold second. The normal version Lada Vesta can be ordered from us with a price starting from 9800 euros without VAT.


Lada Vesta Sport - how it is produced


Here is a video clip where we can see the production process of the Lada Vesta Sport model in a dedicated factory.



Another interesting model is the Lada Vision 4 Ã— 4. This concept is only 4.2 meters long, which fits it in the small class and makes it ten centimeters smaller than the Duster.
On the other hand, were we expecting to see images of the old Lada Niva one day through serious tuning operations? But yes: there are enthusiasts who donate generous funds for tuning operations, even if it is Lada Niva.
