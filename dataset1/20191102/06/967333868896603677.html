      <p>The rockets were fired late on Friday. Eight of them <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911011077202972-air-raid-sirens-activated-across-southern-israel/">were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome air defence system</a>. One of the rockets hit a residential building in southern Israel, damaging it.</p>
      <blockquote>"Israeli fighter jets have started striking terror targets in Gaza. This is in response to 10 rockets fired from Gaza at Israeli civilians earlier tonight," the IDF wrote on Twitter.</blockquote>

      <p>A Palestinian man died as a result of Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip, Ashraf al-Qidra, a spokesman for Gaza's Health Ministry, said Saturday.</p>
      <blockquote>"The 27-year-old Palestinian died today at dawn as a result of an Israeli airstrike in the city of Khan Younis in the enclave," al-Qidra said.</blockquote>
      <p>On Friday, Palestinians held protests near the Gaza border, timed to an anniversary of the release of the British governmentâ€™s Balfour Declaration, published on November 2, 1917. The document expressed support for the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" within the Ottoman Empire's region of Palestine. The protests led to clashes with the Israeli forces.</p>
