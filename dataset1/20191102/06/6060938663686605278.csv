BHUBANESWAR: A 5-1 win for India women, a 4-2 scrape through win for the men. The first round of Olympic hockey qualifiers here on Friday put all predictions to shame. But while it left the Indian eves breathing easy, the men must have woken up anxious on Saturday, with a Russian roulette awaiting them at the Kalinga Stadium.
Rising to the occasion and living up to their growing reputation, Rani Rampal & Co scripted an American heist that will be talked about for years to come.
The win, with a four-goal advantage, has almost decisively tilted the scales in favour of India, who moved with authority and then bossed the game to leave the American girls gasping.



The men's game, though not a see-saw battle, left a lot of questions to answer. The midfield fluidity was missing, the short-corner battery failed miserably (0/5), swapping goalkeepers cost two goals and last-minute jitters returned. On top of that, the Russians faced no meaningful interceptions to their pace-oriented tactics.
These are some of the questions that would have kept Graham Reid awake late at night.
""I was disappointed with the way our boys played. I have spoken to them about that. Hopefully, there will be a reaction tomorrow (Saturday),"" said the India coach on Friday.



""We can show everyone tomorrow how well we can play. I just asked them, who can play better tomorrow? Of course, they all put their hands up. They will have their opportunity to show us how well they can play.""
Indeed, India may do a Dutch, as the hockey world saw last weekend in the first set of Olympic qualifiers. Pakistan held the Netherlands to a 4-4 draw in the first game and were then thrashed 1-6 in the next to miss out on their second Olympics in a row.



The Russian players wore a more satisfied look after the match, after they had managed to change the scoreline from their last two encounters when they were thrashed 8-0 and 10-0 by India to a much respectable 4-2 scoreline, and, more importantly, sowed seeds of doubt in the mind of Indian players.



""The reason why we played so good is that our guys did exactly what our coaching staff told them to do,"" said Vladimir Konkin, the coach of the Russian team. ""That's why we had some good results. Actually we had a lot of opportunities for our forwards but we missed it.""
""We will chase the Indian team, we promise you.""




AMERICANS HAVEN'T LOST HOPE

The US women, too, are trying to not let the four-goal margin affect them, with a match left to play.
""It's always a challenge. We are down four goals. But in my mind, it's half-time now. We have 60 minutes to play,"" said skipper Kathleen Sharkey.
India women's team coach Sjoerd Marijne, too, knows it's not over yet.
""You know how the process can go. You don't get the ticket to Tokyo today. You can get it tomorrow (Saturday). You have nothing so far,"" he had said after India's win on Friday.
