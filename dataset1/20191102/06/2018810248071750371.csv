Overwatch 2 Announced With Emotional Trailer
02 Nov 2019, 06:16 by Cecilia D'Anastasio



Blizzard has finally announced Overwatch 2, the next iteration of the developer’s massively popular first-person hero shooter.
In the new trailer, revealed today at Blizzcon, Overwatch heroes Mei, Winston and Tracer touch down in Paris, which is overrun by omnics from the extremist group Null Sector. When a behemoth omnic shows up to wreak havoc and all looks lost, the Overwatch team reassembles along with a new friend:



In June, Kotaku reported that Blizzard cancelled its Starcraft first-person shooter to redistribute resources to Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4. At that time, Kotaku learned that Overwatch 2 would have a strong player-versus-environment element—something regular Overwatch players might have encountered in the game’s Halloween and anniversary seasonal events.
Those events received mixed reactions at first, with some players citing how canned or static they felt. As the game aged, players received more dynamic PvE events, like April, 2017's “Uprising.”
Last week, the leaks continued as Rod “Slasher” Breslau shared details about Overwatch 2 on ESPN. The report claimed that Overwatch 2 would offer more story and narrative, plus items and hero talents. Jeff Kaplan, the game's director, added that Push would be the core mode for ranked and casual play, and it will become the main competitive mode for the Overwatch League.
More details incoming.
