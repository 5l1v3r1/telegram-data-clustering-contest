Caris LeVert added 25 points for the Nets, who shot 49.4 percent while not being led in scoring by Kyrie Irving for the first time this season. Irving finished with 22 points and 10 assists to post his first double-double as a Net.
Bucks 123, Magic 91
Giannis Antetokounmpo notched a double-double and Milwaukee used a big second quarter to breeze past host Orlando in the first meeting between the teams this season.
The Bucks outscored the hosts 31-14 in the second quarter en route to a 62-41 halftime lead. Antetokounmpo tallied 29 points, 14 rebounds and six assists for Milwaukee, which bounced back after Wednesday’s 116-105 loss in Boston.

Celtics 104, Knicks 102

The Celtics’ Kemba Walker led all scorers with 33 points, who won their fourth straight after a season-opening loss at Philadelphia. Tatum added 24 points, Gordon Hayward 13 and Grant Williams 10.
Morris hit five 3-pointers, including three in the final four minutes, and finished with 29 points to lead the Knicks, who completed a two-game road trip that began with a 95-83 loss at Orlando on Wednesday.

Pistons center Andre Drummond had another monster performance in the paint with 25 points and 24 rebounds in 35 minutes.
Spurs 127, Warriors 110
Patty Mills scored five of his game-high 31 points in a 10-0 burst late in the third quarter as San Antonio finally broke free from Stephen Curry-less Golden State in San Francisco.
After earlier in the day announcing that Curry is likely to miss three months after undergoing surgery on his broken left hand, the Warriors led San Antonio in the second minute of the third quarter and hung within 83-79 with 3:20 remaining in the period before the Spurs took charge.
Mills, a former star at nearby Saint Mary’s College, shot 6-for-9 on 3-point attempts en route to his season-best point total for the Spurs, who were coming off a 103-97 road defeat to the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday night.

The Pacers earned their second consecutive win after an 0-3 start, which included a loss to Cleveland six days earlier. A strong second quarter erased a rough start for Indiana, which scored just 19 points in the opening period. Coach Nate McMillan, who didn’t have Myles Turner because of an ankle injury, started T.J. Leaf instead.
Indiana came out sluggish, and its 3-point shooting never improved: The Pacers shot just 18.5 percent (5-of-27) from deep. Justin Holiday, who scored eight points off the bench, was the only Pacer to make more than one 3-pointer.
