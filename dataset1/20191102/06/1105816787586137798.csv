Donald Trump jokes that Melania wouldn't cry if he were shot
02 Nov 2019, 06:46 by Entertainment Desk
During a private fundraising event at Trump Hotel recently, US president Donald Trump appeared to joke that his wife, Melania Trump, wouldn’t cry if he was shot.
According to Politico, Trump gave a speech in which he discussed the shooting of House Minority Whip Steve Scalise in 2017, remarking that the Louisiana Republican was incredibly tough, reported InStyle.
He then reportedly said Scalise’s wife “cried her eyes out when I met her at the hospital that fateful day … I mean not many wives would react that way to tragedy, I know mine wouldn’t.”

Was he implying that Melania wouldn’t shed a tear if he was shot? And who are the “wives” he knows who wouldn’t react that way to a tragedy? Perhaps crying just isn’t his wife’s thing.



That’s not the end of the bizarre comments. Politico also reported that “Trump quipped he wouldn’t recommend getting shot as a weight loss plan.”
It hasn’t been a good week for the US leader. The House of Representatives voted to approve the rules governing the next steps in the impeachment inquiry over his alleged conduct in dealings with Ukraine. This will usher in a new phase of an investigation that poses the greatest threat to the Trump presidency to date.
