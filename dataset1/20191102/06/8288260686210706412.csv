Liverpool fans have been having their say on whether midfielder Fabinho should start against Aston Villa.
The Brazilian is just one booking away from a yellow card with a crucial top-of-the-table clash against Manchester City to come next week.
That means if Fabinho plays and is booked against Villa on Saturday afternoon, he will miss that all-important match-up at Anfield.
Stuck in a dilemma, Jurgen Klopp spoke about the situation in his pre-match press conference.
""I don't know yet,"" the Liverpool boss replied when asked if he will be risking Fabinho.
