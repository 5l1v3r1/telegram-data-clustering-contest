      <p>"Police in Hallandale Beach believe there may have been a witness to the July murder of Silvia Galva, and 'her' name was Alexa," reports the South Florida Sun-Sentinel.<br/><br/>Slashdot reader <a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/~PolygamousRanchKid+">PolygamousRanchKid </a>tipped us off to the story: <i>According to a search warrant, investigators <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/crime/fl-ne-amazon-alexa-murder-investigation-20191031-qccpvdl6kng5hcx3z6eusxa264-story.html">want to know what the popular voice-controlled smart speakers overheard during a fatal altercation</a> between Galva, 32, and her boyfriend, Adam Reechard Crespo, 43, on July 12.. A month after Galva's death, police obtained a search warrant for anything recorded by the two devices that were found in the apartment between July 11 at 12 a.m. and July 12 at 11:59 p.m.<br/><br/>"It is believed that evidence of crimes, audio recordings capturing the attack on victim Silvia Crespo that occurred in the main bedroom... may be found on the server maintained by or for Amazon," police wrote in their probable cause statement seeking the warrant. Whether police stumbled across a silent witness or are overestimating the eavesdropping capacity of smart technology remains to be seen. Amazon turned over multiple recordings, but neither the company, police, nor the State Attorney's Office will say at this point what was on them. "We did receive recordings, and we are in the process of analyzing the information that was sent to us," said Hallandale Beach Police Department spokesman Sgt. Pedro Abut...<br/><br/>"Amazon does not disclose customer information in response to government demands unless we're required to do so to comply with a legally valid and blinding order," Amazon spokesman Leigh Nakanishi said. <br/><br/>"Amazon objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course."</i></p>
