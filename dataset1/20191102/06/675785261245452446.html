      <p>London is expected to be "quite wet and windy" for much of Saturday and gusts could reach up to 40-50mph across the capital.</p>
      <p>Met Office meteorologist Alex Deakin told <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/weather/1199009/UK-weather-forecast-latest-updates-Met-Office-Saturday-November-2-death-warning">Daily Express</a> that rain will be "especially heavy across the southwest and the northeast".</p>
      <p>He said: "That will linger into Sunday as well, it's all from an area of low pressure swinging in through the early hours of Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>"We've got the band of rain swinging across the south and lingering across parts of southwest England and Wales into the afternoon."</p>

      <p>Coastal areas in the south such as Dorset, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight are expected to be badly hit as the strong gusts of winds would "certainly cause some travel disruptions".</p>
      <p>Southeastern Railway has posted on its <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> account that trains will be affected by speed restrictions due to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> warning.</p>
      <p>"Tomorrow, lines on the map below marked in orange will have a speed restriction imposed because of forecast high winds," it wrote.</p>
      <p>"Certain trains have been altered and these are now showing in the journey planners. Please check before you travel."</p>
