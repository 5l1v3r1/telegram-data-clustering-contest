The election of M Iriawan who had served as Metro Jaya Police Chief was colored by the resignation of a number of his competitors.
La Nyalla M. Mattalitti decided to withdraw from KLB so he was not present. Then Bernhard Limbong retreated right before the event began.
Six other candidates, as reported by BBC News Indonesia reporter Heyder Affan, left the PSSI Congress room. They are Fary Djemy Francis, Vijaya Fitriyasa, Yesayas Octavianus, Aven Hinelo, Benny Erwin, and Sarman El Hakim.
Practically M Iriawan only has to face the two remaining candidates, Rahim Soekasah and Arif Putra Wicaksono.
In the outbreak, FIFA President Gianni Infantino gave a speech through a two-minute video stating FIFA supported and congratulated PSSI on November 2, 2019.
Under the leadership of M Iriawan, PSSI was faced with various challenges, such as the alleged fixing and the readiness of Indonesia to host the U-20 World Cup in 2021.
