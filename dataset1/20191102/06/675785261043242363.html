      <h1>Katie Price says she wasn't picked for X Factor: Celebrity as Simon Cowell 'fancies' her</h1>
      <h2>The telly star said she would have loved to appeared on the show with Megan McKenna and Vinnie Jones</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T06:13:58+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 06:13</time> by <a rel="author">Brogan-Leigh Hurst</a></address>
      <p>Katie Price has claimed she wasn't approached for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> : Celebrity because <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> "fancies" her.</p>
      <p>The former glamour model, 41, has made desperate attempts for a music career over the years, and now she's shared her outrage at being snubbed from the singing competition.</p>
      <p>She insisted she wasn't approached for the talent show because of 60-year-old Simon.</p>
      <p>On her new YouTube video, the mum-of-five recalled her reality TV career experience as she discussed programmes she'd want to do in the future.</p>
      <p>"Why the f**k did they not have me on Celebrity X Factor? I so wanted to do that, I put it out there so many times," she snapped.</p>

      <p>A distraught Katie then moved on to slam contestants who made it onto the show, and added: "I am sorry, I normally love X Factor but I have to say that Megan McKenna has to win the show for sure.</p>
      <p>"I didn't think they made a good choice there, I don't think the others are that great."</p>
      <p>Admitting how much of a great talent she is, Katie said: "They should have had me on it, they'd have got more headlines and I can sing."</p>
      <p>But she then cheekily said: "Maybe it's because Simon fancies me, wheeeey!"</p>
      <p>In recent weeks the star has attempted to give her singing career another go as she joined forces with Sam Bailey.</p>
      <p>Katie revealed she was recording a duet with the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> 2013 winner, 42.</p>
      <p>She shared updates from their studio session on her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> stories, with the duo belting out the tunes in the recording booth.</p>

      <p>They appear to be recording a cover of the 1988 song 1-2-3 by Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine.</p>
      <p>In a clip Sam is in the booth in a black and white check shirt, belting out: "My love just come and get it."</p>
      <p>But all has yet to be revealed as Katie has still not released any music.</p>
