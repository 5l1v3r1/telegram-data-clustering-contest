Moon Hee-sang will attend the 'G20 Congress Summit' in Tokyo, Japan on the 4th. On the 5th, a special lecture will be held at Waseda University on 'Suggestions for Restoring Future-Oriented Korea-Japan Relations'. Depart for three nights to make an appointment. However, given the recent worsening situation, only the official schedule promised in Japan will be processed. As a result, Moon canceled the schedule of the opposition legislators who had agreed to accompany him on this trip. He ordered that the size of the tour be reconfigured to the minimum number of people. Japan's House of Representatives Santo Akiko publicly regretted Mr. Moon's remarks regarding the necessity of a king's apology on Japanese comfort women. In February, Chairman Moon stated in a media interview that the king would resolve the issue of comfort women by holding the hands of the comfort women victims. As the Japanese politicians fiercely protested, Moon expressed his apology, but Santo demanded the apology again and deepened the conflict. Despite these circumstances, Moon, who has always practiced the belief that he should not break a promise once in any difficult situation, decided to digest the schedule as scheduled. ""We must not cancel the event we promised with Japan."" Moon received an official invitation letter on September 20 from the Japanese council chairperson, the organizer of the G20 National Assembly, and a request for a special lecture at Waseda University was received on the 12th of last month. seeit@news1.kr
