      <h1>Ryan Lowe expecting no Devon Derby hangover from his Plymouth Argyle players</h1>
      <h2>The Pilgrims are taking on Grimsby Town at Home Park this afternoon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T06:00:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Ryan Lowe has insisted that Plymouth Argyle have put behind them the Devon derby drubbing by Exeter City last weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">The Pilgrims return to League Two action</a> for the first time since their 4-0 defeat at St James Park when they host Grimsby Town this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Argyle did have an EFL Trophy tie against Chelsea Under-21s at Home Park on Tuesday, which they lost 1-0, but that was a very low-key affair.</p>
      <p>The visit of Grimsby, however, gives them the opportunity to pick up important league points.</p>
      <p>Lowe, during his pre-match Press conference, dismissed talk of the heavy defeat by Exeter being a ‘difficult situation’.</p>
      <p>He said: “We haven’t had no difficult situations really. We just had a difficult game and lost.</p>
      <p>“So there are no difficult situations. Yeah, the lads might have not performed and whatever else. We get that, they are human beings.</p>
      <p>“They don’t go out there to lose. There are no difficult situations.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think in footballing terms we have come under any sort of difficult situations all season.</p>
      <p>“You might have come under some sort of situation where the ball has been booted up the pitch and we haven’t dealt with a header, or we haven’t dealt with it defensively, then yeah.</p>
      <p>“But difficult situations? I don’t think we have put ourselves in many situations at all.”</p>
      <p>The defeat by Exeter came after back-to-back wins at Home Park against Carlisle United (2-0) and Leyton Orient (4-0).</p>
      <p>Lowe added: “That was one loss in seven. It’s disappointing because it was against your arch rivals, yeah we know, but what can we do?</p>
      <p>“It’s gone and we move on quick. I’m a bubbly character, I’m a positive character and I will make sure my players and staff are.</p>
      <p>“It’s gone, we move on. We will have a chance to rectify that in March when we play (Exeter) next.</p>
      <p>“Until then, we have probably got another 14-15 (league) games to get through so, yeah, we are looking to bounce back on Saturday.”</p>
      <p>Argyle’s victories over Carlisle and Orient have left them with a record of four wins, three draws and one defeat from eight home league games this season.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “We have done reasonably well and that’s what we want to continue.</p>

      <p>“We want to make it a fortress, we have to extent. We could finish teams off more and quicker, and see it out, which we haven’t done at times.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, that’s where we are at at times. We have conceded silly goals, we know that.</p>
      <p>“But there is no better place than the training pitch to make sure you put that right and what I can say is the lads are taking on board everything.”</p>
