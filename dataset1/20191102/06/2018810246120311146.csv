Move over battle royales, auto battlers are now the new genre of choice. Hearthstone will be getting its own Auto Chess-style mode, which will go into open beta from November 12 internationally.
The mode will support up to 8 players, and players will recruit minions on a round-by-round basis. Not many other details had been revealed during the opening keynote, although a follow-up release noted that the mode will feature 24 heroes at launch. More information was due to be revealed later at Blizzcon during the Hearthstone panel, and the game mode is playable on the Blizzcon show floor.

More to come...
