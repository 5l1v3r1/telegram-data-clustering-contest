      <p>Liverpool fans have been having their say on whether midfielder Fabinho should start against <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a>.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian is just one booking away from a yellow card with a crucial top-of-the-table clash against Manchester City to come next week.</p>
      <p>That means if Fabinho plays and is booked against <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> on Saturday afternoon, he will miss that all-important match-up at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Stuck in a dilemma, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/not-possible-against-aston-villa-17186648">Jurgen Klopp spoke about the situation in his pre-match press conference</a>.</p>
      <p>"I don't know yet," the Liverpool boss replied when asked if he will be risking Fabinho.</p>
