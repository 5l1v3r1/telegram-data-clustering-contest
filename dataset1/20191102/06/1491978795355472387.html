        <i>Charlie, 24, trainee solicitor, meets Allegra, 20 dental student</i>
      </p>
      <h3>Allegra on Charlie</h3>
      <p><b>What were you hoping for?</b><br/>A fun time, good food and an interesting story.</p>
      <p><b>First impressions?</b><br/>Friendly, nice eyes, a little nervous.</p>
      <p><b>What did you talk about?</b><br/>The Bristol food scene, cooking, dentistry, his lawyering, how we are both sarcastic and the awkward situations it gets us into. There were a fair few pictures of his very cute niece, and many pictures of my brother’s wedding.</p>
      <p><b>Any awkward moments?</b><br/>Maybe when he said he hadn’t been to the dentist in three years.</p>
      <p><b>Good table manners?</b><br/>Pretty good, although a bit weak, because he didn’t finish his pie.</p>
      <p><b>Best thing about Charlie?</b><br/>Similar levels of sarcasm, and our mutual love for Bristol street food chain <a href="https://www.chillidaddy.com/">Chill</a><a href="https://www.chillidaddy.com/">i Daddy</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Would you introduce him to your friends?</b><br/>I would, but I don’t think they’d have too much to talk about.</p>
      <p><b>Describe Charlie in three words?</b><br/>Sweet, sarcastic, quiet.</p>
      <p><b>What do you think he made of you?</b><br/>He probably thought I was a bit much. I talked a lot (word-vomited), but mainly because he wasn’t really returning my questions.</p>
      <p><b>Did you go on somewhere?</b><br/>No, the night had reached a natural conclusion.</p>
      <p><b>And... did you kiss?</b><br/>A kiss was not on the cards. I’m not sure there was attraction on either side.</p>
      <p><b>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?</b><br/>To have a bit more of a spark/have it feel a bit more date-y. I would have talked less about dentistry.</p>
      <p><b>Marks out of 10?</b><br/>A solid 6. It wasn’t bad, but felt like a dinner with one of those friends you don’t know what to say to. (Also, he said he’d follow my food Instagram and didn’t.)</p>
      <p><b>Would you meet again?</b><br/>He was really sweet, but it’s going to have to be a no from me. Sorry, Charlie.</p>
      <h3>Charlie on Allegra</h3>
      <p><b>What were you hoping for?</b><br/>Specifically, not a 20-year-old student.</p>
      <p><b>First impressions?</b><br/>Great dungarees.</p>
      <p><b>What did you talk about?</b><br/>Dentistry, Bristol v London, the perennial dogs conversation, more dentistry, her food Instagram, her Instagram detailing the horrid things boys send on Tinder, and a bit more dentistry.</p>
      <p><b>Any awkward moments?</b><br/>I felt quite self-conscious about my metallic filling.</p>
      <p><b>Good table manners?</b><br/>Excellent. And she was quite sympathetic to me struggling to navigate the sourdough starter.</p>
      <p><b>Best thing about Allegra?</b><br/>She employed sarcasm well, and I was inspired to bring forward my next dental appointment.</p>
      <p><b>Would you introduce her to your friends?</b><br/>Of course. They might want to see their dental hygienist first, though.</p>
      <p><b>Describe Allegra in three words?</b><br/>Floss. Every. Morning.</p>
      <p><b>What do you think she made of you?</b><br/>Somewhat charming, somewhat aloof.</p>
      <p><b>Did you go on somewhere?</b><br/>Alas, no.</p>
      <p><b>And… did you kiss?</b><br/>I don’t think we had that kind of connection.</p>
      <p><b>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?</b><br/>That we had got through more of the bar tab.</p>
      <p><b>Marks out of 10?</b><br/>6.</p>
      <p><b>Would you meet again?</b><br/>We’re at different stages in our lives, so unfortunately not.</p>
