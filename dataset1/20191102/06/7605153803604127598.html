        <b><i>BAMAKO, Mali, Nov 2 – </i>Fifty-three soldiers were killed Friday in a “terrorist attack” on a Mali military post in the northeast of the country, the government said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The assault is one of the deadliest strikes against Mali’s military in recent Islamist militant violence.</b>
      </p>

      <p>A civilian was also killed at the outpost in Indelimane, in the Menaka region, close to the border with Niger, the country’s communication minister Yaya Sangare said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“The situation is under control. A search and the process of identifying the bodies is continuing,” he added, after giving the latest update on the death toll.</p>
      <p>He said 10 survivors were found at the outpost, which suffered “significant” damage.</p>
      <p>No further details of the attack were given.</p>
      <p>The Malian government earlier condemned the “terrorist attack,” saying it had left numerous dead or wounded but without giving a precise toll.</p>
      <p>“Reinforcements have been dispatched to secure the area and hunt down the attackers,” the statement added.</p>
      <p>No group immediately claimed responsibility for Friday’s assault.</p>
      <p>It comes a month after two jihadist assaults killed 40 soldiers near the border with Burkina Faso, however several sources said the death toll had been down played.</p>
      <p>The deadly assault sparked protests outside a military camp in the country’s capital Bamako.</p>
      <p>Mali’s army has been struggling in the face of a jihadist revolt that has spread from the arid north to its centre, an ethnically mixed and volatile region.</p>
      <p>The recent assaults are also a humiliation for the so-called G5 Sahel force — a much-trumpeted initiative under which five countries created a joint 5,000-man anti-terror force – and for France, which is committed to shoring up the fragile region.</p>
      <p>Northern Mali came under the control of Al-Qaeda linked jihadists after Mali’s army failed to quash a rebellion there in 2012.</p>
      <p>A French-led military campaign was launched against the jihadists, pushing them back a year later.</p>
      <p>But the jihadists have regrouped and widened their hit-and-run raids and landmine attacks to central and southern Mali.</p>
      <p>The violence has also spilt over into Burkina Faso and Niger where militants have exploited existing inter-communal strife, leaving hundreds dead.</p>
