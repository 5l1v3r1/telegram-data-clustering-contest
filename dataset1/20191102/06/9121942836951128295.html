      <h1>Seattle’s rate of car ownership saw the biggest drop among big U.S. cities — by far</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T06:00:58+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/author/gene-balk-fyi-guy/" target="_blank">Gene Balk / FYI Guy</a></address>
      <p>When it comes to car ownership, Seattle has finally turned a corner.</p>
      <p>Census data released last month shows the city’s car-ownership rate has dropped dramatically in the past several years. In the new estimates, about 81% of Seattle households owned at least one vehicle in 2018 — that’s the lowest rate since the 1980s.</p>
      <p>And that number is down by 3 percentage points just since 2010, which is a tremendous change in less than 10 years. In fact, among the 50 most-populous U.S. cities, Seattle’s drop in its car-ownership rate is the biggest, and by a wide margin.</p>

      <p>We now rank 11th among the 50 largest cities for the percentage of car-free households. Since 2010, we’ve leapfrogged Miami, Milwaukee, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Oakland, California.</p>
      <p>What makes Seattle’s nation-leading drop in car ownership even more remarkable is that only 11 of the 50 largest cities saw any decline at all. And in most of our “peer” cities — those with similar demographics — the rate of car ownership has actually bumped up since the start of the decade: Portland, San Francisco, Denver, Boston, Austin, and Minneapolis. (The exception is Washington, D.C., which saw a decline of less than one percentage point).</p>
      <p>One reason, surely, is that we’ve <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/seattle-area-spends-most-per-capita-to-build-transit-heres-why/">invested more than any other region in transit</a>, and as a result, we’ve led the nation in <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/transit-ridership-continues-to-grow-in-central-seattle-while-solo-car-commutes-decline/">ridership growth</a>. Significant improvements in transit, including the light-rail line that opened in 2009, have made it a lot easier to get by without owning a car.</p>
      <p>Advertising</p>
      <p>Another factor: Seattle has experienced tremendous population growth since 2010, and due to strict zoning laws, the vast majority of that growth has been <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/seattle-zonings-urban-suburban-divide-heres-how-the-citys-two-halves-are-changing/">concentrated in a handful of high-density</a> areas that are walkable and transit-rich. That means a greater share of city residents live in neighborhoods where they have the option of forgoing car ownership and instead relying on transit, walking, biking and car-share services.</p>
      <p>And so, the benefits of owning a car no longer outweigh the costs and the hassle for an increasing number of Seattleites. There are now nearly 64,000 households in Seattle that do not own a car, a 46% increase since 2010.</p>
      <p>To be sure, that’s still just 19% of the city’s households — we’re a long way off from New York City, where 55% are car-free.</p>
      <p>Younger and older people in Seattle are much less likely to own a car than folks in the middle. For households headed by someone under age 35, or by someone 65 and older, nearly one-quarter do not own a car. That number drops to 13% for households headed by someone 35 to 64.</p>
      <p>There’s something else of interest in the new census data. It also shows that the total number of cars owned by Seattleites could finally be leveling off.</p>

      <p>It may sound paradoxical, but in recent years, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/booming-seattle-is-adding-cars-just-as-fast-as-people/">the number of cars in Seattle has spiked</a>, even though the percentage of households that own a car has declined. That’s because car-owning households have still increased (though at a slower rate), including those that own multiple vehicles.</p>
      <p>Advertising</p>
      <p>But not last year. The numbers were flat between 2017 and 2018, both for households with one car and for households with multiple cars.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Seattle households owned about 457,000 vehicles — that’s basically unchanged from the 2017 estimate (461,000).</p>
      <p>Granted, that is still an awful lot of cars crammed into the city’s 84 square miles of land area, and a huge increase from 2010, when the total number of vehicles was about 389,000.</p>
      <p>Also, it’s only one year’s worth of data, so it’s far too soon to call it a trend. Even so, it’s still a welcome change from recent years, in which Seattle’s car “population” grew at the same pace as its human population.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/seattle-has-reversed-a-decades-long-trend-of-car-ownership-and-millennials-are-the-reason/">2017 column</a>, I first reported on a small decline in Seattle’s car-ownership rates, reversing decades of increases. At that time, I asked, “Has Seattle reached ‘peak car’?”</p>
      <p>With the release of new data showing that the trend has only accelerated, and I believe we now have a definitive answer to that question: Yes.</p>
