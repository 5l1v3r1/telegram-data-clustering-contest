When the heart no longer beats
02 Nov 2019, 06:00 by Alenka Obzhot Klancic

Parents whose child died during pregnancy or shortly after childbirth were sometimes left alone. The maternity wards did not deal with them specifically and there was not much talk in public. This attitude has been changing in recent years. The Solzice Society has great credit for helping parents cope with the painful loss and cooperating with Slovenian maternity hospitals. Children's memory parks are also being created, which mean a great deal to the mourners.

The second memorial park in Primorska was recently opened at the cemetery in Stara Gora. It was renovated in Postojna years ago and is also planned in Koper. Such parks are created at the initiative of the Solzice Society, which helps grieving parents with the loss of a baby during pregnancy or shortly after childbirth. The municipality of Nova Gorica and the Municipality of Nova Gorica arranged it in Stara Gora on the initiative of the above mentioned association and the General Hospital dr. Franz Derganc Nova Gorica.
“Fortunately, in Sempeter Maternity Hospital, there are not many cases where a child dies during pregnancy or shortly after childbirth; in recent years, there is an average of one per year. However, it is very bad when a pregnant woman comes in and says that she did not feel the movement of the baby at night. Then you look at the ultrasound and you don't see a blinking heart, and Mommy looks at you with questioning and scared eyes. You look again because you hope you were mistaken ... When it is clear that the heart is no longer beating, and this must be told to your mum, this is the worst, ”describes the saddest moments in her work as a gynecology specialist, Neda Bizjak. and obstetrics, which was one of the initiators for the erection of a memorial park in Stara Gora.
Free Lecture The Solzice Society will prepare a lecture on November 15th in Nova Gorica on the topic of child loss during pregnancy and at birth. The free lecture will be held at 5 pm in the large hall of the New Town Hall.


Neda Bizjak

She is aware of the importance of supporting parents at such times, both inside and outside the maternity ward. Knowing that their baby has died, according to her, moms and dads are accepting in different ways. “At first it is a shock and it is severe, then numbness appears, as a kind of defense mechanism. It is as if the organism itself makes sure that you survive by somehow moving away from it. They seem to understand and accept everything, but then after a while they are home, everything comes after them, ”he says from experience.
When the cradle is empty
The fact that it is even worse when arriving home is also influenced by the surroundings. “As long as you are in the hospital, when you come home, you are thrown into an environment where you expected a new family member to come. And there are questions, calls. Usually, such a couple comes to talk about the baby after two months. If he was stillborn, the pathologist examines him and can discuss with his parents what caused the death. A lot of grief often occurs at that time and you decide if they need any other professional help. ”
They have a clinical psychologist at a maternity hospital in Ljubljana and are offered psychological treatment for pregnant women if something bad happens in pregnancy or shortly after birth. There is no “house” psychologist in Sempeter, but they are aware of the importance of psychological support in such moments. “So far, this has not been an established practice in us. Recently, however, we find that this support is necessary. We started working with the Solzice Society to organize lectures for health care staff on how to provide parents with appropriate support. We are aware of the importance of expertise, so we plan for our social worker to be more involved. ”
What are the most common causes of a baby dying during pregnancy or immediately after childbirth? “When something breaks down towards the end of pregnancy, the umbilical cord or the insufficiency of the placenta is most often caused by the fact that the placenta does not function as it should and feeds the baby for various reasons. Otherwise, the cause of death is most often a problem for the mother, whether it is a chronic condition that occurred before becoming pregnant, or a disease that occurs during pregnancy. ”
It is very rare for a baby to die from childbirth complications. ""Sometimes, when there was no ultrasound, this was happening, because they were not able to assess the child's appearance, and sometimes something surprised them. This was most often when there were irregularities in the child. Now you see on the ultrasound what you can expect, how big the baby is, developed. So there is no bigger surprise and if there is a chance of something going wrong, the team is quickly ready for a caesarean section, ”Bizjakova points out.
Footprint for memory
Most parents want to see a dead baby. In some maternity wards, they may also photograph him and get a hand or foot print. ""This is not yet a practice in our country, but parents can say goodbye to a child before being taken to pathology. They can be with him for a few minutes, name him, cross him ... They can see the aborted embryo as well. ”
In order to provide their parents with adequate support, they established contacts with the Solzice Society, run by Petra Paver, in many Slovenian maternity hospitals. When her daughter died shortly after giving birth, she became aware of a number of shortcomings in the Slovenian health care system during mourning. She founded a society that provides individual therapies, meetings, educations, and the society also published the book Empty Cradle, a broken heart, intended for grieving parents, as well as medical staff, relatives and friends.


At the opening of the Souvenir Park in Stara Gora, Petra Paver from the Solzice Society emphasized the importance of such places for grieving parents.

“It was my great desire to come to maternity hospitals as well, and now I have experiential workshops where I can tell in concrete cases what parents want, what we expect and what we don't like,” emphasizes Petra Paver. She also did two research assignments and found that much had changed in the last fifteen years. ""Parents can now create memories, be able to babysit, say goodbye to them and decide how to bury them. This differs greatly by region across Slovenia; in larger maternity hospitals the movements are faster, in smaller ones it is slower. But if years ago, it was the practice that moms who gave birth to a dead baby were in the room with moms with newborns, this is increasingly rare. In principle, it helps parents avoid these unpleasant situations. ""
In the park, parents get the right to mourn
The Shempeter Maternity Hospital started working with the association four years ago. “In celebration of the 50th anniversary of the maternity hospital, we were assessing, by points, what we have and what we don't have yet. That's when a lot of talk started about psychosocial support, and even in professional lectures, there was always some point about parental support. My sister and sister of the maternity ward Ruza Nanut, who was very involved in everything, called Petra and we started to cooperate. At that time, the initiative for a memorial park in Stara Gora appeared. The hospital management supported it, and then there were quite a few complications, but I am very proud that we opened it this year, ”Bizjak said.
Memorial parks, in Slovenia there are now seven, are very important for grieving parents. “Every death of a child is a harrowing experience for parents. But the death of a child at the beginning of life is different, because these children did not exist for society. Because our child did not speak, walk, they treat us as if he did not exist. That is why we need a park, because this gives parents the right to mourn and their children to exist. It is even more important to begin mourning that there is a nameplate on the baby's name. With that, there is evidence that the child was our parents, and so is the right to mourn, ”emphasizes Petra Paver.
