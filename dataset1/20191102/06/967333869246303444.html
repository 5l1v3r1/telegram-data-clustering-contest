      <p>Last week, more than one million people gathered in Santiago, planning to hold the largest demonstration in Chile's history.</p>
      <p>President Sebastian Pinera then said that the authorities had heard the message of the protesters.</p>
      <p>The rallies, which began in October, were caused by a spike in transportation costs. They subsequently led to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911011077202959-dios-mio-state-department-accuses-russian-trolls-of-meddling-in-chile-protests/">larger protests against economic and social policies</a> and resulted in unrest.</p>
      <p>The situation led to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201910311077186054-chile-says-to-share-achievements-in-preparing-for-apec-forum-with-next-host-malaysia/">the cancellation of an APEC summit</a> and COP25 climate forum, which were planned to be hosted by Santiago.</p>
