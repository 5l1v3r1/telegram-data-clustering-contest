      <p>Purchasing the premium quality HP Spectre x360 13 has become a lot easier as Amazon is now giving a handsome discount on the purchase of the convertible.</p>
      <p>HP’s Spectre x360 13 is now down to $1,299 — the lowest price ever on Amazon. The convertible is also an excellent choice for the artists and the best part about the HP Spectre x360 13 is that it’s available with a bundled digital pen, meaning that you don’t have to purchase it separately, unlike Microsoft’s Surface Pro.</p>
      <p>The HP Spectre x360 13 is a beautiful 2-in-one and probably the best looking out there at this moment. The two-in-one features 12-inches 4K touch screen display, powering the device is a 4GHz 8th Gen Intel Core i7. This is not a gaming beast, but you will be able to play low-end games just fine with the Intel UHD graphics 620. Otherwise, you’re getting 512GB of SSD storage capacity coupled with 16GB RAM, support for Windows Hello, biometric fingerprint reader, 22.5 hours of battery life, and so much more.</p>
