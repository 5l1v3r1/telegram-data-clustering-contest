Marie Alcober2 minutes agoNovember 2, 2019 WHAT TO X-PECT TONIGHT THE X Factor: Celebrity continues TONIGHT, with the second live show of the series. Megan McKenna and Jenny Ryan are among the stars taking to the stage this evening – here is what you need to know. After Ricki Lake and Olivia Olson crashed out of the competition last week only 11 celebrity contestants remain. Those still competing in the competition have been split into three categories, with each mentored by a different judge. Simon Cowell is watching over the ‘Groups’, which includes V5 – the Latino influencers turned girl group – Try Star, made up of three rugby stars, and twin brothers Max and Harvey. The 60-year-old music mogul is also mentoring No Love Lost which includes Love Island 2018 stars Wes Nelson, Samira Mighty, Eyal Booker and Zara McDermott. Meanwhile, Jonny Labey, Kevin McHale and Megan McKenna, who make up the ‘Unders’ are under the watchful eye of Louise Walsh. Then, there is Nicole Scherzinger, who is taking charge of the ‘Overs’ and therefore is responsible for making sure Victoria Ekanoye, Martin Bashir and Vinnie Jones make it through to the finals. The remaining acts will give it their all on the big stage tonight to be crowned the champion of the first The X Factor: Celebrity. What’s more, the winner will receive a £1 million record deal under Syco Music and will be given the opportunity to get the Christmas No.1 spot. Tonight, the live show will kick off on ITV at 8.30pm, with Dermot O’Leary resuming hosting duties, and finish at 10.20pm. During the show James Arthur, who won the ninth series of The X Factor in 2012, will return to the programme which made him a household name. He will perform his new single, Quite Miss Home, and he has been tweeting about his excitement at being back on the show. On Twitter, he wrote: “Excited to say I'll be making a return to @TheXFactor on Saturday night to perform 'Quite Miss Home'. Tune in at 8.30 on @ITV.” As always viewers will be able to vote for their favourite acts via the X Factor app and only the app, as all other methods do not apply.
