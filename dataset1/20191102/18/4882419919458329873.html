      <p>Ernesto Valverde says he is not thinking of resigning from Barcelona after the team went down 3-1 at Levante on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"I'm not thinking of resigning," said the coach, when asked if he would quit. With a serious face, he reiterated his commitment to the club.</p>
      <p>The question had been asked after a third defeat in La Liga, away from Camp Nou, after falling against Levante and Athletic, which allows league leaders Barcelona to be overtaken by Sevilla or Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>"We have to analyse what happened and ask ourselves why it did," said Valverde in his press conference.</p>
