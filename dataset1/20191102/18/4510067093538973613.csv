‘She’s a Beauty’: Trump Doubles Down Attack on Clinton Over Her Claim Gabbard is ‘Russian Agent’

02 Nov 2019, 18:00


The former secretary of state and Democratic presidential candidate sparked a bitter feud with Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and former Green Party candidate Jill Stein last month after intimating that they were “Russian assets.”

US President Donald Trump continued to defend Democratic presidential hopeful Tulsi Gabbard and physician Jill Stein on Friday, telling supporters at a rally in Mississippi that his former rival Hillary Clinton was continuing to spread a “hoax” which she had originally tried to use against him.
“She’s a beauty,” Trump said, commenting on Mrs. Clinton and her email server scandal. “How about last week? Did you hear? I don’t know who Tulsi Gabbard is, but I know one thing: she’s not an agent of Russia.""
""And Jill Stein, she’s a greenie, that’s fine. We love the environment, everybody in this room…I don’t know Jill Stein, she ran last time. I don’t know her, but I know she’s not an agent of Russia,” Trump added.
“When Hillary made those statements, two statements, both of them – ‘they work for Russia', 'they’re agents of Russia’, I said you know, when she made that statement about me three years ago, it took me two years to get out of that hoax statement! She made it about them, everybody laughed because of what we proved,” Trump said.
“But I’ll tell you what, these are very bad people. These are very dishonest people, and the media is worse than all of them,” Trump noted.
Clinton vs. Gabbard
Last month, former first lady and secretary of state Hillary Clinton implied in a podcast that Tulsi Gabbard and Jill Stein were “Russian assets,” prompting a firestorm of criticism from Gabbard, who called the former secretary of state “the queen of warmongers, the embodiment of corruption, and the personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.” Stein, meanwhile, accused Clinton of making up a “completely unhinged conspiracy theory,” and recommended that the former candidate spend more time reflecting on why she lost in 2016.
Trump later joined the debate, tweeting that “Crooked Hillary” was “at it again!”, and accusing his former rival of being “crazy.”
Gabbard has taken advantage of Clinton’s attack and the national media attention it brought to engage in fundraising, with a recent USA Today/Suffolk poll showing her increasing in the polls to 4 percent support, overtaking rivals Senator Kamala Harris and entrepreneur Andrew Yang but still far behind the frontrunner, former vice president Joe Biden, as well as senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

Oradea yesterday, Oradea today: The story of the bridges in the city of Crișul Repede
02 Nov 2019, 18:50 by Cristian Culiciu




1916. Iron bridges

Around the First World War and at the end of a short period of development, in Oradea, there were, over Crişul Repede, several pedestrian, road and railway bridges built on a metallic structure. Built in 1893, under the name of ""baptism"" Szent László, the Little Bridge (photo), which connected the central markets and was crossed by the tram, was at the beginning of the twentieth century the most crowded.
At 56 meters long and 11 meters wide, the bridge had no support pillar and the structure was arch-shaped.
The construction was blown up in 1944 by the retreating German army. According to its model, around 1910 a bridge was erected near the Citadel, at the end of the present Magheru boulevard.
Perhaps the most beautiful road bridge built at the time was on Vitéz Street (Decebal), which had been modeled as the Chain Bridge in Budapest and had been put into use in 1913. To these was added the pedestrian bridge near the Commercial Hall, called the Parallel Bridge, but also the railway bridge in the Velenţa area, on the Oradea - Cluj railway. To these bridges over Criş were added the footbridges over the streams Peţa, Paris, Sălbatic.

2019. Developed infrastructure

Currently, except for the railway bridge in Velenza, none of the bridges from 1916 exist. If the bridge in the center was blown up by the German army, the one on Decebal street was broken by the flood, and the bridges over Peţa disappeared with the course of the stream.



Now, over Cris there are eight road bridges, two railways and one pedestrian. The oldest is the Szent László Bridge, completed in 1949 and shortly followed by the Dacia Bridge. The latter was expanded twice, in 1996 and 2019, to take over the growing traffic in the area. Also, the Ladislau Bridge, which also bears the name of Ferdinand, was recently rehabilitated (photo).
The Decebal Bridge was inaugurated in 1984, when the blockhouse district was barely beginning to be built, and the Intellectual Bridge dates back to 1974. The first bridge on Densusianu Street was built in the same period and the second in 2011. Among the bridges. new ones of the city include Carol I (2011), Present (2015) and Centenary (2018). Two other pedestrian bridges are in the plan, one near the Hilton Hotel, another in the area of the ""Mihai Viteazul"" College.
