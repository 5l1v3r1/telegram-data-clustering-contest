      <p>The United Auto Workers union announced on Saturday that its president, Gary Jones, is taking a paid leave of absence amid a federal corruption investigation.</p>
      <p>The news came a little over a week after UAW-represented workers at General Motors approved a new contract <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/30/general-motors-gm-strike-future-work-collective-action">after a 40-day strike</a>.</p>
      <p>The UAW said Jones requested the leave, which is effective from Sunday. Vice-president Rory Gamble will be acting president.</p>
      <p>“The UAW is fighting tooth and nail to ensure our members have a brighter future,” Jones said in a statement. “I do not want anything to distract from the mission.”</p>
      <p>The union is in the middle of negotiating new four-year contracts with Detroit automakers. Union members are scheduled to begin voting on Monday on a deal with Ford which Gamble helped negotiate. If Ford workers ratify that agreement, the UAW will begin bargaining with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/fiat-chrysler">Fiat Chrysler</a>.</p>
      <p>The FBI has been investigating fraud and misuse of funds at the UAW for more than two years. Ten people have been convicted, including union leaders and auto company officials.</p>
      <p>In a recent court filing, federal prosecutors alleged that seven top UAW officials had conspired since 2010 to embezzle funds through schemes such as submitting false vouchers for conference expenses.</p>
      <p>The Detroit News, citing sources familiar with the investigation, said Jones was one of the unnamed union leaders.</p>
      <p>Jones has not been charged, but federal agents searched his suburban Detroit home in August.</p>
