      <h1>Why some of Elizabeth Warren's Medicare-for-all financing plan might be 'implausible'</h1>

      <p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) unveiled her plan to finance Medicare-for-all without a middle class tax increase Friday, and while she's received a fair amount of praise, others were quicker to point out some flaws.</p>
      <p>Josh Barro <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/11/three-takeaways-from-warrens-medicare-for-all-payment-plan.html">wrote in <i>New York</i></a> that he found many of the ideas in the plan to be "worthy," but he also noted that a few were "implausible," and probably don't do enough to solve the financing issues that are currently blocking the U.S.'s path to single-payer. He's not sold on the senator doubling her proposal to increase an annual wealth tax on billionaires from 3 percent to 6 percent â€” the proposed tax is already "constitutionally dubious," Barro <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/11/three-takeaways-from-warrens-medicare-for-all-payment-plan.html">writes</a>, and he's also skeptical about her adviser's confidence in enforcing it. Along those lines, Barro doesn't think it's realistic to expect an extra $3 trillion per decade through increased spending on tax enforcement alone, even though the writer favors such a move himself.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, Barro <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/11/three-takeaways-from-warrens-medicare-for-all-payment-plan.html">says</a> he remains convinced Warren would not enact single payer health care if elected next year since she'll either be working with a Republican-controlled Senate, or a slim Democratic majority which would still consist of moderates who wouldn't sign up for a lot of the proposals she has brought to the table.
