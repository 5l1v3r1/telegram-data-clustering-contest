Lawsuit: Kentucky SWAT Team Aims Assault Rifles at Children in Futile Search for Marijuana Grower
02 Nov 2019, 18:00 by Lauren Floyd
A Black couple is suing a Kentucky police department after 14 SWAT officers raided their home last year and allegedly held the pair and their three children at gunpoint after accusing the couple of growing and selling marijuana. 
The lawsuit, filed Oct. 21 on behalf of Ashlea Burr and Mario Daughtery, alleged that Louisville Metro Police officers violated the couple’s Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure when officers conducted the raid, according to the lawsuit Atlanta Black Star obtained Thursday.

A SWAT team used explosive devices and drew “assault rifles on minor children,” Oct. 26, 2018, in the 1900 block of West Chestnut Street, according to the suit.  
The suit also alleged that the premise for the raid was completely false.
Detective Joseph Tapp allegedly said in a search affidavit the lawsuit cited that “a black male named Anthony McClain is growing marijuana and has multiple bags of marijuana packaged for sale in the front bed room” and that “a white female named Holly was his girlfriend and owned the house.”
“Those representations were false, made willfully and/or in reckless disregard for the truth, and even the most basic due diligence would have revealed their falsity,” attorney Josh Rose said in the lawsuit. 
Burr isn’t white, and no one named Anthony McClain or Holly lived in the home, which the lawsuit said was owned by a man named Kevin Hyde.
The suit said Burr “shielded her children from the rifles” and that both she and Daughtery were “extremely frightened that their children would be maimed or killed and/or that they themselves would be maimed or killed.” 
Police “forced” Daughtery “on the ground at gunpoint,” and when one of the children tried to run to her grandmother’s house, “officers drew their assault rifles on her” and told her to get on the ground, according to the lawsuit.
“It was cold and rainy, and (the child) was not wearing any socks, shoes or a jacket,” the suit said.
“She repeatedly requested to be taken to her grandmother’s next door, but the officers refused the requests, kept her in the cold, wet conditions, and kept their rifles on her,” according to the lawsuit. 
Officers allegedly said the girl “may have weapons in her hair,” the suit alleged.
The family is seeking a jury trial and compensatory and punitive damages, according to the suit.
Rose told WDRB the children have gone to counseling and experienced multiple nightmares.
The couple’s 14-year-old daughter can be heard sobbing in bodycam video depicting what happens after the raid.

painful defeat
England cries defeat in rugby final
The enormous English expectations to emulate the victory of 2003 ended in major disappointment
02 Nov 2019, 18:45 by Enric Gil
The English were glued to television screens across the country while the 15 men in white marched through the grass about to face South Africa in the final of the Rugby World Cup. It was 9 o'clock in the morning on the islands, the game was played in Japan, but about 10,000 kilometers the emotion reached a high point.
England had not reached the final of the Webb Ellis Cup for 12 years and the possibility of seeing Captain Owen Farrell raising it stopped the country. Thousands of pubs opened early to broadcast the game serving morning pints to warm the body and distract the nerves. In London alone, the Evening Standard estimated that there were about 2,000 and, along with them, a large number of rugby clubs were also filled. Tens of thousands of Red Rose fans traveled to Japan without tickets hoping to get some or, at least, to be close to the historical moment.
Joy after winning the All Blacks
After eliminating the almighty All Blacks in the semifinal, he was confident that he could emulate Sir Clive Woodward's deed in 2003. But the huge expectations collided with a defeat without palliatives. On the radio, BBC journalist Matt Dawson summarized the popular sentiment at the end of the meeting: ""We are finished, the South Africans were not one step ahead, but two or three.""
In the Black Lion of Manchester, to burst, the screams and initial jubilation ended in silence and even some tears like those of Amy, a 30-year-old woman who had followed the game with her father. ""It's our family tradition to go to the pub to follow England's rugby games. Today I was optimistic and we were excited, but this ... has been too much.""
However, Sam, a silent retired Sir of 71 years and with glassy eyes, says he feels ""proud"" because rugby ""has brought the English back together."" ""It's been a while since I saw people with so much hope, today has been a day of strong emotions and this will help the country. In time we will value it more.""
