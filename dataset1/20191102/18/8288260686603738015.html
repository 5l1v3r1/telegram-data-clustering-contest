      <h1>'Less comfortable' Pep Clotet blamed Birmingham City's Cardiff defeat on this</h1>
      <h2>Blues boss was asked about Cardiff's controversial first penalty and referee Andrew Madley’s overall display in 4-2 Championship defeat</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T18:15:48+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 18:15</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Dick, https://www.facebook.com/blueswriterbriandick/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/pep-clotet">Pep Clotet</a> insisted <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> ’s defeat to Cardiff City had more to do with their own errant finishing than the performance of referee Andrew Madley.</p>
      <p>  <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-cardiff-live-reaction-17176413">Blues were beaten 4-2 in rainy south Wales</a> , with Joe Ralls scoring a hat-trick, including two penalties.</p>
      <p>The first of those came when Blues were 1-0 up and utterly dominating the Bluebirds, having taken the lead through Kristian Pedersen and hit the goal frame through Jude Bellingham and Dan Crowley.</p>
      <p>That 30th minute penalty, awarded for pulling at a defensive corner, invigorated the hosts who went ahead eight minutes later and despite being reduced to ten men early in the second period always had their noses in front.</p>
      <p>“It was a game with a little bit of everything, a lot of emotion, a lot of intensity,” Clotet said.</p>
      <p>“For us, we feel we  leave Cardiff without receiving what we deserve.  I think the big difference between both teams was the way Cardiff had all the luck when it comes to transforming those chances - and we didn’t.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We knew it was a very tough place, it was a very difficult game for us because it’s very easy to get sucked into Cardiff’s football and make it very difficult for yourself.</p>
      <p>“But I think the players in the first half started very well and put out the football we wanted and created a lot of chances - in total 25 shots on goal - and we still only managed to score two goals.</p>
      <p>“It’s a platform for us to understand we need to make sure we put the game to bed as soon as we can. That’s the reality.</p>

      <p>“As soon as Cardiff had the opportunity to get back into the game on that penalty, they took it. <br/> </p>
      <p>“That was probably the difference, they took all the opportunities they had to get back into the game and for us it was hard work because we had to build a lot to make chances. <br/> </p>
      <p>“But the first half that I saw is the way I want Birmingham City to play.”</p>
      <p>Asked about the penalty and Madley’s overall display he said: “The fourth official told us in the game it was a pull in the box. It was difficult to for me to see if the evidence in there. <br/> </p>
      <p>“We are in a position the only thing we can do is carry on with any decision he takes and be prepared. <br/> </p>
      <p>“I was less comfortable with the fact I wanted our team to be able to transform into more goals the chances that we had. <br/> </p>
      <p>“Obviously I think being a referee is a very difficult game, the only thing we need to demand from them is every decision we  make is very, very clear because every decision changes games and changes results.”</p>
