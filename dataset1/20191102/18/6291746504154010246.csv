Pat Brown hoping red-hot form will lead to World T20 place for England
02 Nov 2019, 18:00 by Ali Martin

Death-bowling specialist impressed on his debut but is keen to avoid being labelled a short-format player

His county teammates have accused him of suffering from red-ball rash but Pat Brown, whose rise to prominence has come as a death-overs specialist in short-form cricket, still harbours ambitions of becoming an all-format player.
The 21-year-old seamer has played five first-class games in his career but after two seasons starring in the T20 Blast led to Friday’s England debut in the victory over New Zealand, he can already call himself an international.
It was the steel shown in closing out the home side’s subpar innings that led to a healthy dose of praise from the captain, Eoin Morgan, on the day. Brown went for six runs in the 20th over – gold dust at that stage of proceedings – and removed the experienced Ross Taylor for his first international scalp.
The dismissal was typical of the skills that earned his call-up for this T20 series: a slower ball fooled Taylor for a catch in the deep, even if Alan Richardson, Worcestershire’s respected bowling coach, joked that his pupil will tell folk that “c Bairstow b Brown” was a nick behind in years to come.
The bowler does not want to be pigeon-holed just yet, however, with a stress fracture detected in his lower back last winter – one that continues to be managed – the reason he did not appear during the 2019 County Championship campaign.
“I kept it simple [on his debut] but there are definitely more tricks to come,” said Brown, who will follow this tour with spells in Abu Dhabi’s T10 tournament and at the Melbourne Stars in Australia’s Big Bash League.
“It’s quite a nice compliment if people think I have written off first-class cricket. It means they rate my white‑ball stuff highly. But it’s something I’m definitely looking to do and stop the boys saying I have got red-ball rash.”
The back injury – one Brown puts down to his body “getting in some pretty minging positions” – allowed him to complete a degree in business management at the University of Worcester, although this first England outing has meant missing out on the graduation ceremony.
Brown said making the squad for next year’s T20 World Cup in Australia is on everyone’s mind in this fresh-faced touring party but he has yet to detect any “animosity towards the new boys or fear for people’s places”. That is not the way under Morgan, whose captaincy Brown likens to that of Moeen Ali’s at Worcestershire.
“They do it in different ways but get the same message across,” he said. “It’s calm and collected. They make you feel like you are going to nail whatever ball you go for and all they really ask for is clarity in your plan and to not going into something half-hearted.
“Mo has made me a much better player over the last two years by [me] bouncing ideas off him and being in his company. He is an unbelievable player and it would be nice to have him here as a familiar face. But Morgs has been really good.”
Brown believes his two T20 Finals Day appearances – winning the trophy in 2018 before losing in the final this year – can only help him adjust to the atmosphere and scrutiny of international cricket. But it is 2018’s losing semi-final against Kent in the Royal London Cup, a tournament he will miss next year when playing in the Hundred, that shaped him as a death bowler after failing to defend 11 runs in the final over.
“Having that moment and that failure really spurred me on to be the man who gets the team over the line,” he said. “As a death bowler, you’ve got to want to do it. If you don’t fully commit to certain things and you are on the back foot, you get found out.”

The Berlin derby, thirty years after the fall of the wall
Tonight, for the first time in the history of the Bundesliga, a team from East Berlin and one from West Berlin will play against each other

02 Nov 2019, 18:50

November 9th will be the thirtieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, one of the most important events in European history of the twentieth century. That day thirty years ago, for the first time since the Wall had been built by dividing the German capital in half, tens of thousands of inhabitants of the eastern part of the city poured into the west. This evening, a few days before the anniversary, the first derby of the national football championship will be played between a team from the west, Hertha Berlin, and one from the east, the Union Berlin.
Although Berlin is the German city to have had more teams in the Bundesliga, only four Berlin derbies have been played in the history of the first division championship, and all of them are teams from the western part of the city. The Hertha, based in the Charlottenburg district, is by far the most famous Berlin team with the most first-division participation. In 1977 he played the last city derby against Tennis Borussia, a team that now plays in the minor regional series, while in the last decade he had already met the Union, but only in the second division, after being relegated in 2010 and in 2012.
The first derby in the Bundesliga between Hertha and Union is played Saturday evening at 6.30 pm at the An der Alten Försterei stadium, in the eastern district of Köpenick. The stadium reflects the purely popular origins of the Union, a professional club founded over a century ago, re-founded in the 1960s and now run entirely by its fans. The Union is not limited to respecting the rules of the German championship which impose the majority position of the popular shareholding in the properties of the teams, but applies them to the totality of the quotas: it has no members with more ""weight"" than the others, as it happens in many other clubs, and its president, Dirk Zingler, is only a fan with experience in the business sector voted by the majority of members.



The team's current stadium - 22,000 seats, almost all standing - was built with the help of hundreds of volunteers, the same ones who saved the club in 2004 by taking advantage of the German law that provides for a reimbursement to blood donors. In those years the Union was close to failure and to afford to pay the license to join the fourth division gathered its supporters to donate blood to Berlin hospitals. With the repayments of the donations paid in the coffers of the club, the managers were then able to enroll in the championship. Over the last fifteen years, the Union, starting from that initiative, has climbed four divisions. Last summer, beating Stuttgart in the play-offs, he got the first promotion in the Bundesliga of his history. After nine days he has seven points in the standings, four less than the Hertha.
