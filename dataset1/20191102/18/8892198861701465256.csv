Kommunen: - Vi mener dette er riktig skilting
02 Nov 2019, 18:10 by Martin Andersen
Man kan ikke ha både påbudsskilt, kollektivskilt og underskilt, sa politiet. Det er slik Statens vegvesen har bestemt at man skal skilte, svarer kommunen.
Politiet har reagert på skiltingen som er satt opp i krysset der Søndre gate møter Olav Tryggvasons gate (i retning fra Jernbanestasjonen).

Bolsonaro says he caught condominium taping and denies obstruction of justice
02 Nov 2019, 18:00 by Guilherme Mazieiro
After stating that he had access to the recordings of the concierge of his condominium Vivendas da Barra in Rio de Janeiro, President Jair Bolsonaro (PSL) stated, in an interview with the website The Antagonist, that it is ""bar forcing"" to interpret this as a possible obstruction to Justice.
""We did not copy anything, we did not take the answering machine anywhere. My son went there, put it on the screen March 14 last year and where he had a call to both houses, mine and his, he clicked on top and recorded the audio. Nothing more than that. Any other interpretation is bar force, ""said the president.
Earlier, reporters said the president had ""caught"" the tape before ""it was tampered with."" ""We got all the memory from the answering machine that has been stored for years. The voice is not mine, it is not from 'your Jair'. Now, what do I suspect? That the doorman read without signing or induced him to sign that. Now who's behind it? Governor Wilson Witzel, ""he said.
The president made the remarks during an interview with journalists, when he went to remove a motorcycle he bought in Brasilia. He did not make clear by whom or for what reason the content would be tampered with.
Bolsonaro also made it unclear on what date he got the condominium recordings. Asked by the report about whether he was aware of Bolsonaro's access to the recordings, the prosecutor in Rio said he did not comment on cases involving the president.
On Wednesday (30), Bolsonaro's son, Carlos Bolsonaro (PSC-RJ), showed tapes of the condominium concierge and there were no records of doorman calls to his father.
This week, Jornal Nacional pointed out that the concierge of the Bolsonaro condominium, in testimony, said that one of the suspects of murdering
Marielle, Élcio Queiroz, applied for permission at Jair Bolsonaro's house to enter. After the call, he drove home to fellow Ronnie Lessa. The prosecution dismissed the porter's statement.
Reaction
The president's speech reverberated in Brasilia. Federal Rep. David Miranda (PSOL) said the president had committed a crime of responsibility and would meet with House leaders to pursue an impeachment request from the president.
""President Jair Bolsonaro posted on his social networks that he obtained the condominium material we saw this week, clearly showing a obstruction of Justice. Why? Why is Jair Bolsonaro cited within this process, this process went to the STF [Supreme Court] for the president to be investigated, ""Miranda said in a video posted on her Twitter account.
Senator Randolfe Rodrigues (REDE - AP) has also said he will file an obstruction of justice against President Jair Bolsonaro. The representation is also signed by opposition leader in the House, Alessandro Molon (PSB-RJ). They must file the document on Monday (04).
