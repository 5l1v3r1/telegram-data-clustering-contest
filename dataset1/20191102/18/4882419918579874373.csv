Ter Stegen 5 - Beaten three times in seven minutes, couldn’t be the hero
Sergi Roberto 5 - Back at right-back, did OK at the back but didn’t offer anything going forward
Gerard Pique 3 - After a decent first half he collapsed in the second half, imprecise and badly positioned
Clement Lenglet 3 - Nervous and weak during the 90 mins, at fault for the third
Nelson Semedo 6 - One of the few who did OK, earning the penalty for the opener
Frenkie de Jong 5 - Could not take control of the game, this time featuring in Busquets’ role
Arthur Melo 4 - Was not involved in the game and could even have been sent off in the first half
Arturo Vidal 4 - The Chilean is a coin flip and this time it didn’t work - played without order
Leo Messi 6 - Scored the first and then added another but it was ruled out because of Griezmann’s offside
Luis Suarez 5 - Quiet until he was taken off injured
Antoine Griezmann 4 - Tried hard but should offer more when it comes to determining the game

SUBS

Carlos Perez 5
Sergio Busquets 4
Ansu Fati 5
