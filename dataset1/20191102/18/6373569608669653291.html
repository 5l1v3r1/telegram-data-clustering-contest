      <h1>How the League Two table stands after Plymouth Argyle's postponed Grimsby Town game</h1>
      <h2>Ryan Lowe's Pilgrims were not in action but 11 matches were played across the division on Saturday</h2>

      <p>Plymouth Argyle dropped three positions to 13th in League Two after the latest round of matches took place while their game against Grimsby Town at Home Park was postponed.</p>
      <p>Ryan Lowe’s Pilgrims were not in action after their fixture was called off on safety grounds after damage to the roof at the Barn Park End.</p>
      <p>Eleven other matches went ahead in League Two, with Forest Green Rovers taking over at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>That followed a 2-1 away win against Cheltenham Town in an all-Gloucestershire derby game.</p>
      <p>Argyle’s next league game will be away to Forest Green on November 16, following their FA Cup first round tie at Bolton Wanderers next Saturday.</p>
      <p>Bradford City moved up to second spot in League Two after beating Exeter City 2-0 at Valley Parade.</p>
      <p>Three players were sent-off in that match, including Exeter skipper Jake Taylor and defender Tom Parkes.</p>
      <p>The Bantams are a point behind Forest Green and ahead of Swindon Town and Crewe Alexandra on goal difference.</p>
      <p>Swindon won 2-1 at home to Walsall while Crewe, the previous table toppers, lost 1-0 to visiting Port Vale.</p>
      <p>Argyle are four points behind Newport County in seventh, who occupy the last of the four play-off positions.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Pilgrims’ under-18s were in action on Saturday but suffered a heavy defeat.</p>
      <p>They were beaten 5-1 at home by Swindon in the EFL Youth Alliance on the 3G pitch at the Manadon Sports Hub, with striker Rubin Wilson getting their goal.</p>
      <p><b>League Two results:</b> Bradford City 2 Exeter 0, Cambridge United 2 Crawley Town 1, Carlisle United 2 Macclesfield Town 1, Cheltenham Town 1 Forest Green Rovers 2, Crewe Alexandra 0 Port Vale 1, Mansfield Town 2 Colchester United 3, Morecambe 1 Leyton Orient 0, Newport County 1 Salford City 2, Oldham Athletic 2 Northampton Town 2, Scunthorpe United 0 Stevenage 0, Swindon Town 2 Walsall 1.</p>
