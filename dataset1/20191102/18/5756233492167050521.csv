Reaction to claims of meat and poultry waste in sausage and sausage making

02 Nov 2019, 18:06


The head of the Food and Drug Administration identified breeding quality of bread as one of its top priorities and said there were allegations that poultry and meat scraps were used in processed parts such as sausages and sausages, so we should avoid producing them. .


Sunshine News:

Dr. Mohammad Reza Shanazaz at the World Food Day conference hosted by the Institute of Nutrition Research and Food Industry of the country, said that one of the most important indicators of health is the discussion of food and nutrition and no common sense denies this, said the Ministry of Health as The principal trustee of the health sector is responsible for supplying healthy food from a qualitative point of view, although the Ministry of Health certainly cannot handle the heavy burden alone.
Referring to the dramatic increase in life expectancy in Iran in the years following the Islamic Revolution, he said: ""Despite all the propaganda directed at the enemies against our country, and despite all the media propaganda against the country, there are no specialized and unbiased opinions. The parties acknowledge that Iran has made good strides in the field of health, which have led to more than twenty years of life expectancy in the country. Increasing life expectancy has occurred in the shadow of cross-sectoral thinking and coordination.
Shan Maker continued: In the area of food and nutrition, food safety and food security are also important. Certainly healthy eating has been one of the factors in increasing life expectancy. In other areas, such as trauma, addiction, etc., we have seen a set of devices work to alleviate or eliminate a problem.
""The number of our graduates, professors and colleges in the field of food and nutrition in the post-revolutionary years is not comparable to what it was before,"" said the head of the Food and Drug Administration. . If today we claim to have the benefit of technical leaders for the entire food industry, it is thanks to the huge educational momentum that has taken place in the years since the Islamic Revolution. I would like to thank the technically responsible colleagues in the food industry and the investors in this field who have taken steps to create food independence for the country.
Shan Maker emphasized: Today we must change our management practices in the field of food. The complexity and variety created in this area suggests that our management practices must change too. Currently, only one-third to one-two of our production capacity is occupied in the food industry, meaning our food industries have between 5% and 5% empty capacity, which means there is a depletion of resources, so now we do not recommend creating new companies but our recommendation. This is to fill the empty capacity of industries and reduce costs.
He said that today, 5% of food products are produced in the country and we import a small portion of them, said: ""In the field of licensing, we need to change our methods and reverse this upside-down funnel."" We are currently undergoing severe strictures at the time of issuance of the license, but we do not regulate it when we enter the product market while we have to change our management and monitor the market. At the moment, we are mainly focused on licensing and subsequent oversight is not being adequately implemented, but we do need to outsource licensing and enable companies working in the field to conduct surveys. And then we issue licenses based on their studies, though we may not have the legal and judicial infrastructure needed to monitor and deal with the market, but we need to step into these areas gradually and do outsourcing faster.
Referring to the Food and Drug Administration's priorities in the field of nutrition, Shan Maker said: ""One of our top priorities is the bread debate, which is the focus of all watchdog organizations, and their determination to improve the quality of bread."" So we need to move on to bulk breads and to replace industrial breads. Meat cutting is another priority. We need to know what happens to chicken and meat waste. The important thing is that there are claims that these items and scraps are used in processed parts such as sausages and sausages, so we should avoid producing them. We should not collect bodies at the bottom of the river, but we must make sure that the one who does not swim can not enter the river, so it is important to discuss the segmentation of protein products and their greater oversight.
He continued: Another important issue is public education, which is very effective. Our presence in education and textbooks is very low, while we need to focus on educating the next generation in the field of nutrition. Our other priority is to pay attention to new products that come into the food basket; for example, in the field of spills, we see very extreme theories. Some agree to use these products and some reject their health. We have to find the right answers to these questions today. The Environment Agency, the Standard Authority, and the Ministry of Health are all involved in the debate on transgender, but people want to answer these questions and give people a right answer so that their concerns are not raised.
The truth is that we are currently being ruthlessly attacked by enemies, in violation of all human rights law. The enemy's goal is to prevent people from accessing strategic goods and to disrupt people's mental, psychological, and physical well-being. Their aim is to disrupt the country, which is why the debate over medicine and medical equipment is so special right now that the enemies have planned that the items will not be made public. Their latest filthy move was the US Treasury Letter, which, despite being said to have not been sanctioned in the area of health, was also targeted for crackdowns and narrow avenues for the supply of medicine and medical equipment.
""A small number of banks work with us, but the enemies have made it very difficult for them to be afraid to work with us under the pretext of monitoring,"" said the head of the Food and Drug Administration. One of the most important fronts in which we fight global arrogance today is the quantitative and qualitative supply of medicine and medical equipment. Fortunately today, thanks to God, we have become independent in the field of medicine and medical equipment and there is no medicine or equipment we need but we cannot produce it and at the same time it takes us a lot of time to supply and supply energy. We spend more and less on food because of the specific circumstances of the country.
