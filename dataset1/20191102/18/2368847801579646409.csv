美中仍無高階談判 美:尚餘突出議題繼續副部磋商

02 Nov 2019, 18:06

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】美中原計劃11月中旬簽署「第一階段貿易協議」，但敲定協議文本的高階談判至今仍未排上日程。日前雙方談判代表通話，美方隨後表示，還有突出議題需要解決，繼續低階談判。
中共商務部消息，11月1日，中共副總理劉鶴和美國貿易代表萊特希澤、財政部長姆努欽通話，雙方取得了「原則共識」，並討論了下一步磋商安排。
而美國貿易代表辦公室就此次通話發表的聲明，則稍有不同。聲明稱，雙方在一系列領域取得進展，正處於解決突出議題的過程中，雙方將繼續副部級磋商。
上月路透社曾引述消息稱，為使美中首腦能在11月中旬智利的APEC峰會上簽署第一階段協議，萊特希澤和姆努欽將在11月3日當週訪問北京，和劉鶴敲定協議文本。但如今已經進入11月，不但智利宣布了取消主辦APEC峰會，美中敲定協議文本的高階談判仍不見蹤影。
不過，多名美國高級貿易官員仍然表示，仍計劃在本月中旬簽署協議。
白宮經濟顧問庫德洛11月1日說，美國兩國貿易談判「氣氛音樂」一直「很積極的，很有建設性」，協議雖然還沒有最後完成，但農業、金融服務和貨幣領域的談判已經接近完成。
當天，美國商務部長羅斯也表示，貿易協議目前處於良好狀態，考慮到川普（特朗普）總統和習近平主席剛好在11月中旬時日程有空，兩國仍然可能在那時候簽署協議，但具體日期未定。川普也在推特表示，美中貿易談判順利，正在物色舉行簽訂協議的地方，美國的愛荷華州可能是其中一個選址。
《美國之音》報導，第一階段協議可能將包括中方恢復購買美國農產品和飛機等產品，中方承諾不操縱貨幣，以及加強保護在華美企的知識產權等。
庫德洛說，目前談判取得了巨大的進展，甚至超出了在今年春天時的進展。川普也表示，第一階段協議包括了美中總交易60%的內容。
不過，中共四中全會剛剛閉幕，中共官員就通過彭博社表示，對美中達成全面長期協議表示懷疑，並稱除非川普取消全部加徵的關稅，否則中方不會進行結構性改革。中方官員還表示，中共在「棘手問題」上絕不妥協。中方這種表態，等於重申了此前的所謂「三大底線」，顯示北京毫無進行市場化改革的誠意。
外界多有評論認為，即使雙方能達成第一階段協議，旨在從根本上解決結構性問題的第二、第三階段協議也將遙遙無期。

There is still no high-level negotiation in the US and China.

02 Nov 2019, 18:06

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] The US and China plan to sign the ""first-phase trade agreement"" in mid-November, but the high-level negotiations to finalize the agreement text have not yet been put on the agenda. A few days ago, the negotiators of the two sides talked, and the US side subsequently stated that there are still outstanding issues that need to be resolved and continue low-level negotiations.
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce reported that on November 1, the Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and the US Trade Representative Wright Heze and the Finance Minister Mnuchin said that the two sides had reached a ""consensus of principle"" and discussed the next consultation arrangements.
The statement made by the US Trade Representative Office on the call is slightly different. The statement said that the two sides have made progress in a series of areas and are in the process of resolving outstanding issues. The two sides will continue consultations at the ministerial level.
Last month, Reuters quoted the news that in order to enable the US-China summit to sign the first phase agreement at the APEC summit in Chile in mid-November, Wright Heze and Mnuchin will visit Beijing in the week of November 3, and Liu. Crane finalizes the agreement text. But now it has entered November, not only has Chile announced the cancellation of hosting the APEC summit, but the high-level negotiations between the United States and China to finalize the agreement text are still missing.
However, several senior US trade officials still said that they still plan to sign the agreement in the middle of this month.
White House economic adviser Kudlow said on November 1 that the ""ambient music"" of the US trade negotiations has been ""very positive and constructive"". Although the agreement has not yet been finalized, negotiations on agriculture, financial services and currency Already nearing completion.
On the same day, US Commerce Secretary Ross also said that the trade agreement is currently in good condition. Considering that President Trump and President Xi Jinping are on schedule just in mid-November, the two countries may still sign the agreement at that time, but The exact date is not fixed. Trump also said on Twitter that the US-China trade negotiations are going smoothly and that it is looking for a place to sign an agreement. The US state of Iowa may be one of the sites.
""Voice of America"" reported that the first phase of the agreement may include China's resumption of purchase of US agricultural products and aircraft products, China's commitment not to manipulate the currency, and to strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights in Huamei.
Kudlow said that the negotiations have made great progress, even beyond the progress of this spring. Trump also said that the first phase of the agreement includes 60% of the total US-China deal.
However, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party has just concluded. The Chinese Communist Party officials said through Bloomberg that they expressed doubts about the US-China comprehensive long-term agreement and said that unless Trump cancels all the imposed tariffs, China will not carry out structural reforms. Chinese officials also said that the CCP will never compromise on the ""thorny issue."" This statement by the Chinese side is equivalent to reaffirming the previous ""three big bottom lines"" and showing that Beijing has no sincerity to carry out market-oriented reforms.
Many outsiders have commented that even if the two sides can reach the first phase agreement, the second and third phase agreements aimed at fundamentally solving structural problems will be far away.
