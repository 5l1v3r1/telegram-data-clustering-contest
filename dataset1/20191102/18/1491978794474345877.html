        <i>• La Liga champions stunned by three goals in seven minutes <br/>• Ten-man Bayern beaten 5-1 and drop to fourth in Bundesliga</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball">La Liga</a> champions <b>Barcelona</b> fell to a shock 3-1 defeat away to <b>Levante</b> after taking the lead but then conceding three times in the space of seven minutes in the second half.</p>
      <p>They were in a comfortable position when Lionel Messi converted a penalty in the 38th minute, but their collapse began when José Campaña levelled in the 61st minute following a counterattack, then former Real Madrid striker Borja Mayoral put them ahead in the 63rd minute with a superb curling strike. Nemanja Radoja gave the home side extra breathing space with a third goal in the 67th on the volley following a free-kick to inflict Barça’s third defeat of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid then failed to fully capitalise following a 0-0 draw at home with Real Betis, which put them level on points with Barça at the top. Earlier,<b> Sevilla</b>’s Franco Vázquez opened the scoring in the match against <b>Atlético</b> <b>Madrid</b> but Álvaro Morata struck on the hour to earn the visitors a 1-1 draw.</p>
      <p>In the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball">Bundesliga</a>, <b>Eintracht Frankfurt</b> crushed 10-man <b>Bayern Munich</b> 5-1 to send them tumbling to fourth position. First-half goals from Filip Kostic and Djibril Sow put the hosts in the driving seat with Bayern down to 10 players after the ninth-minute dismissal of Jérôme Boateng.</p>
      <p>Bayern cut the deficit through Robert Lewandowski but David Abraham restored Frankfurt’s two-goal cushion after the break. Martin Hinteregger’s header made sure of the points and Goncalo Paciência completed a horrible afternoon for Bayern and piled the pressure on embattled coach Niko Kovac.</p>
      <p>Bayern are now four points behind the leaders Borussia <b>Mönchengladbach,</b> who won 2-1 at <b>Bayer Leverkusen</b>. Oscar Wendt opened the scoring for Gladbach in the 18th minute only for Leverkusen’s Kevin Volland to equalise seven minutes later, but the home side snatched a winner three minutes before half-time through Marcus Thuram.</p>
      <p><b>Union Berlin</b> beat <b>Hertha</b> 1-0 in the capital’s first top-flight derby in Bundesliga history. The last time Union had a top-flight derby, they were playing the Stasi-backed Dynamo in East Germany’s Oberliga in the season before the Berlin Wall came down. Sebastian Polter’s 90th-minute penalty sealed victory in dramatic fashion.</p>
      <p><b>Borussia Dortmund</b> beat <b>Wolfsburg</b> 3-0. Thorgan Hazard, Raphaël Guerreiro and Mario Götze scored second-half goals to seal an emphatic victory.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball">Serie A</a>, Juventus remain top of the table after beating local rivals Torino 1-0 thanks to a goal from Matthijs de Ligt 20 minutes from time.</p>
      <p><b>Roma</b> beat an out-of-form <b>Napoli</b> 2-1. Nicolò Zaniolo opened the scoring for Roma in the 19th minute. Jordan Veretout then converted a penalty and although Arkadiusz Milik pulled a goal back for Napoli, it was not enough.</p>
      <p>Romelu Lukaku scored two late goals, the second a stoppage-time penalty, as <b>Internazionale</b> dramatically won 2-1 at <b>Bologna.</b></p>
      <p>Roberto Soriano gave Bologna the lead with a deflected shot in the 59th minute before Lukaku levelled from a narrow angle in the 75th. The Belgian then fired home the winner from the spot after Riccardo Orsolini kicked Lautaro Martínez’s leg in the penalty area.</p>
