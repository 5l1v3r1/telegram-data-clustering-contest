Maneuver, collection from microtaxes: 2 billion in 2020, 4 in 2021. On Monday the text in the Senate

ROME - The Budget Law is finally closed. The State Accounting Department has stamped, therefore certified, the 199 articles of the budget that will arrive in the Senate on Monday for the parliamentary examination. It will have to be converted into law by December 31 and will come into force on January 1, 2020. It is a maneuver of 30 billion, of which 16 covered in deficit and 14 by taxes (on which there are still majority contrasts), cuts and new revenue from the fight against tax evasion. We see the novelties and the weight of the measures, as emerges from the technical report that accompanies the provision.
Taxes
The maneuver introduces new taxes for 2 billion in 2020 and 4 billion in 2021. Among these, the plastic tax - which alone is worth one billion in the first year and 2.2 billion the second - the sugar tax on sweetened beverages (233 million in 2020 and 262 million in 2021), the tax on company cars with the exception of hybrid and electric vehicles (332 million in 2020, then up to 378 million in 2022), the tightening on tax breaks linked only to digital payments (will produce 868 million ), the ""drum"" tax, on tobacco cigarettes for which it is necessary to buy maps and filters (31 million per year).
Family
The new baby bonus will go to 440,000 new children born in 2020, of which 140,000 in poor families. A third of the benificari will receive the maximum allowance - 160 euros a month - because the family ISEE is under 7 thousand euros. Half of the checks will be increased by 20% because it goes to the children from the second onwards. The maneuver then allocates an additional 190 million on 2020 - and then gradually up to 291 million in 2029 - for the voucher that doubles from 1,500 to 3,000 a year, but is limited only to families with low Isee. In 2019 there were 290,000 applications for vocuher compared to posts of around 350-360,000.
Superticket
The abolition of the health superticket costs 185 million, because the measure starts from September 1, 2020 and is also valid for outpatient specialist recipes, ""without prejudice to the possibility for the Regions to introduce alternative measures with equivalent financial effect as replacement even in areas different "". Since 2021, expenditure on the treasury has increased to half a billion a year (554 million).
VAT Matches
The 15% flat tax for VAT numbers up to € 65 thousand is maintained. But stakes are introduced, albeit limited compared to the original versions of the maneuver. This tightening allows the State to save 894 million in 2021 and 568 million in 2022. The heaviest stake is the prohibition of accumulation for those who have other income from employment or similar ones exceeding 30 thousand euros per year. The other flat tax - that at 20% for VAT numbers between 65 thousand and 100 thousand euros, wanted by the Lega-M5S government and which was due to be launched in 2020 - is canceled instead. The State saves 154 million next year, a good 2.5 billion in 2021 and 1.5 billion in 2022 (when the law was fully implemented).
Guest Houses
Only 8 million gross (6 million net of taxes) allocated to pensions up to 4 times the minimum (2,052 euros gross a month) which by 2020 will be fully revalued (100%) to inflation. The CGIL calculates 2.8 million pensioners who are beneficiaries who will therefore receive about 3 euros more gross per year (25 cents per month).
state
Allocated 3,175 billion at regime (in 2021) for the renewal of the contract of the state workers that result in a gross increase of 3.5% of payrolls. Municipalities and local authorities will then have to allocate 2.53 billion of their competence, always at regime. The total sum for the renewal of all public employment - almost 3.3 million employees - thus amounts to 5.7 billion euros.
