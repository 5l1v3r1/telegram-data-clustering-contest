        <b>In the face of his alleged link to an illegal casino, Bangladesh Workers Party President Rashed Khan Menon has said he does not need to prove his integrity.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“My character is my lifetime achievement. I was honest and I’ve remained honest. I don't think I need not to take any integrity test," he said while inaugurating the 10th Congress of the party at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh in Dhaka on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He made the comments after anti-casino raids on several sporting clubs in Dhaka and Chattogram, including Young Men’s Club, of which the local MP Menon is the president.</p>
      <p>An illegal casino was found in the club and lawyer Eunus Ali Akond, a rival of Menon in the last election, served a legal notice on the MP for his alleged links to casino operations in the club.</p>
      <p>“A cleanup operation on corruption is ongoing now. Since the casino scam is centred in the Dhaka-8 areas where I am the MP, newspapers are publishing reports with false information,” Menon said.</p>
      <p>The Workers Party chief, who has faced criticism of his allies in the Awami League-led coalition for questioning the fairness of the last election, also said the government cleanup operation “has proved that financial criminals have taken politics hostage”.</p>
