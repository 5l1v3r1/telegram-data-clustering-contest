（中央社台北2日電）尋求總統選舉連署的前副總統呂秀蓮今天宣布退選，強調由於法律及政治因素未能完成連署，深致歉意卻也體認人性善與惡，感謝所有支持者，並將繼續與愛好和平公義人士同心協力，為共創美好台灣努力。
呂秀蓮、前南投縣長彭百顯接受喜樂島聯盟推薦投入2020正副總統選舉連署，從9月19日起展開連署活動，須獲得28萬384人連署，才可取得角逐2020總統大選的資格，在收件截止今天下午5時30分前一刻，透過新聞稿宣布退選。
呂秀蓮、彭百顯辦公室提出5點批評，包括總統副總統選舉罷免法強制連署人需附身分證影本規定，侵害公民隱私權，嚴重阻礙連署進行，根本違憲。
此外，中央選舉委員會不許被連署人在連署書上註記「回收地址」，造成國內外各地連署人不知如何回寄連署書的困擾，應負刁難之責。
新聞稿並指出，國內主流媒體及政論節目明顯「政媒掛鉤」，淪為特定候選人的競選工具，並全面無情封殺呂彭相關新聞，形同「媒體集體謀殺 」，當權者高喊民主，卻公然摧殘民主，而媒體自甘墮落，應受國人公譴。
兩人也再度指控，全國各地連署站確實遭受各種形式的恐嚇、辱罵及干擾，甚至收買，以致實際收到的連署書與預期可收的數量產生嚴重落差，內情並不單純，因此決定不提交連署書。
呂秀蓮、彭百顯辦公室表示，非公務機關對個人資料蒐集，應遵守個資法規定，凡已收取呂彭參選連署書而未繳回呂彭被連署人者，應承負法律責任。為此，特別呼籲各界人士提供有關連署不法情事以供查究。1081102
