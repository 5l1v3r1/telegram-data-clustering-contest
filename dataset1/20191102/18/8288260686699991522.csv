The brilliant scenes as Raul Jimenez sends Wolves fans crazy at Arsenal
Arsenal 1-1 Wolverhampton Wanderers reaction | Raul Jimenez cancelled out Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's first half goal to rescue a point for his side in the Premier League clash

Wolverhampton Wanderers fans were in raptures after Raul Jimenez reduced a point for his side at Arsenal on Saturday afternoon.
The Mexico international cancelled out Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 21st minute strike when he headed in Joao Moutinho's looping cross past Bernd Leno in front of the visiting fans .
That result keeps Wolves ' Premier League unbeaten run since September 14's 5-2 defeat to Chelsea intact and was the perfect tonic to the 2-1 Carabao Cup loss to West Midlands rivals Aston Villa on Wednesday night.
For Jimenez, too, it was a welcome strike - he now has two goals in two games in the League - after a barren run of four goalless matches.
