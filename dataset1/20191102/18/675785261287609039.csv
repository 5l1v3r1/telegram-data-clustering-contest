Best audiobooks worth downloading of 2019 - so far
With only a couple of months left to go of 2019, if you're looking for a new audiobook to perk up the morning commute, these are some of the best this year so far
02 Nov 2019, 18:00 by Brijiena Lovelace, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/brijiena-lovelace/
If you're looking for a new audiobook to spice up the dreaded morning commute, or you just fancy a new bedtime story - an audiobook is a great place to start.
With the swift weather change, the nights are getting colder and darker, much earlier - making staying in at home curled up with a cuppa all the more appealing.
Listening to an audiobook requires a lot less attention than conventionally holding and reading - perfect if you're a busy bee with plenty to get through day to day.
We know we still have a little bit of time until the end of the year, so we've compiled a list of some of the best audiobooks 2019 has brought us thus far below.
