Hilversum - Today, more than a week after release, the band Krezip has a golden record for the album Sweet High. This award, which is sufficient for more than 20,000 copies sold, was awarded to the surprise of the band during the live broadcast of Muziekcafe on NPO Radio 2. “We really hadn't seen this coming! We are still in the rush of the sold-out concerts last weekend, that the album turned gold so quickly is really incredible and a wonderful icing on the cake, ”says Jacqueline Govaert, singer of the band.

Comeback
In January, the Dutch band Krezip announced after returning for ten years for a performance at Pinkpop and three concerts at the Ziggo Dome that took place last weekend. On the first night of the sold-out series, the band surprised the audience with a brand new album called Sweet High and the new single Come Back With Me Now. On Saturday evening, after the third sold-out show, it was announced that the band will also perform during Vrienden Van Amstel Live in January next year.
Breakthrough Krezip broke through in the year 2000 after a performance at Pinkpop, after which the whole of the Netherlands and Belgium became hooked on the super hit ""I Would Stay"", which made it to the top of the charts in both countries. In the following years Krezip released several albums and the band scored big hits with ""Out Of My Bed"", ""All My Life"" and ""Sweet Goodbyes"". In 2009, Krezip decided to stop and the band members went their own way, but not before they did two farewell shows in a tightly sold out Heineken Music Hall (now known as AFAS Live).
