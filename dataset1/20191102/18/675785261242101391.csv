Mesut Ozil announced it's good to be back playing Premier League football after making his second domestic start of the season against Wolves.
The Gunners' best-paid player has fallen down the pecking order under Emery, but impressed in Arsenal's Carabao Cup defeat by Liverpool on Wednesday.
As a result, Emery opted to include him in his starting XI for this weekend's 1-1 draw with Wolves, with Ozil offering Arsenal more creativity in the middle of the park.
Taking to Twitter after the game, Ozil wrote: ""Good to be back in Premier League action, but not happy about the result at home.

""Many things to work on. We have to keep moving forward with our heads held high.""
Emery announced on Friday Ozil would line up against Wolves as he ruled out Granit Xhaka.
The Swiss clashed with fans during last Sunday's draw with Crystal Palace, after supporters booed him as he was subbed off at the Emirates.

""He is training normally, but like every human he feels emotions. Xhaka's issues last week need time to recover the normality with him and with us,"" said Emery.
""Xhaka has said sorry, he gave apologies to the supporters, to everybody.""
