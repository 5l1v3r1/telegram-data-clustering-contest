      <p>ROANOKE, Va. (AP) - U.S. Attorney <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/thomas-cullen/">Thomas Cullen</a> is under consideration for a federal judgeship to fill a vacancy in U.S. District Court in Roanoke.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/thomas-cullen/">Cullen</a> has been U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia since March 2018.</p>
      <p>The Roanoke Times reports that Virginia’s U.S. senators - Mark Warner and Tim Kaine - asked for an assessment of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/thomas-cullen/">Cullen</a> from the State Bar of Virginia. The State Bar rated <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/thomas-cullen/">Cullen</a> as “highly qualified” for a district judgeship by a 6-0 vote.</p>
      <p>The Democratic senators had no immediate comment on their next step. They had recommended two other candidates to the White House, but neither was picked.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/thomas-cullen/">Cullen</a> has had several high-profile cases during his tenure, including criminal prosecutions related to the Unite the Right white nationalist rally in Charlottesville in August 2017.</p>
