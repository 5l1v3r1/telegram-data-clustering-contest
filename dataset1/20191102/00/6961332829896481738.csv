Scientists are discovering a whole new class of black holes in our galaxy

02 Nov 2019

Scientists have discovered a new class of black holes smaller than any class yet known to this cosmic cluster in space-time.
For many years, scientists believed that black holes should be at least about five times their mass, but they have recently discovered a black hole, which is only 3.3 times the mass of the sun, making it the smallest known hole in the Milky Way galaxy.
Black holes are often found in the so-called ""binary system,"" a system of two astronomical objects, with two stars orbiting each other until their fuel runs out and explodes.
These ""supernovae"" explosions leave behind a dense nucleus called a neutron star, or if there is enough mass, they can leave a thick black hole that even light can not escape.
The scientists studied the data of 100,000 binary star systems until they found an unusually small black hole, only 3.3 times the mass of the sun, compared with 5 to 15 times the mass of the sun, in known black holes.
This discovery may help physicists understand the process of supernovae that make up the black hole, which is the key to the formation of certain elements and the evolution of the universe.
Astrophysicist Todd Thompson of Ohio State University and colleagues analyzed the data collected through the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment, which includes the lights coming from about 100,000 stars in the Milky Way.
Changes in the spectra of light from stars can indicate that a star orbits another object, possibly invisible, such as a black hole.
Scientists searched for stars likely to be close to a black hole. In this sense, they collected thousands of images of each of these stars, observing a single star system called J05215658 orbiting a massive, hidden object about 3.3 times the mass of the Sun. Much smaller than any previously known black hole.
