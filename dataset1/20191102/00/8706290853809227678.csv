Trump: My relationship with Erdogan is very good

02 Nov 2019, 00:06

US President Donald Trump has described his relationship with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as ""very good"", speaking to reporters at the White House.
Referring to the ceasefire in northeast Syria, he commented that it ""holds very well"".
The US president also said that he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Iowa. The two leaders were due to meet this month in Santiago, on the sidelines of the APEC Forum, which was canceled due to social unrest in Chile. ""We are looking at many places"" and ""It could even be done in Iowa"", the state where Xi Jinping lived in 1985 to study agriculture.
Trump also reiterated that trade talks with Beijing are going well, confirming earlier US and Chinese officials' statements on progress.
