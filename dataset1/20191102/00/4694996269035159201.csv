Russian Diplomat Calls US' 'Deal of Century' Example of Swapping Int’l Law for Norms Suitable for US

02 Nov 2019, 00:29


MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The so-called deal of the century on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict settlement that Washington says it is preparing is an example of how the international law is changed for rules that the United States finds convenient, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.

""Instead of implementing these [UNSC] resolutions, the United States promises everyone to present some 'deal of the century,' which, as you have already understood, will not envision the creation of a full-fledged Palestinian state. This is an example of how international law represented by UNSC resolutions is swapped for rules that the United States has invented and which it finds convenient"", Lavrov said in an interview on TV on Friday.
The administration of US President Donald Trump has for years said it would announce its plan for the Israeli-Palestinian peace place. In July, it released what was characterized as an economic component of the plan — an infrastructure and investment project to support Palestinians.
However, the Palestinian authorities have rejected Washington's involvement in the settlement of their conflict with Israelis after Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the Holy City despite the condemnation of the Muslim world and the UN recommendations to refrain from establishing diplomatic missions in the city until its legal status is settled.
The UN Security Council has issued multiple resolutions on the Israeli-Palestinian settlement. For years, the Arab world remains committed to the Arab Peace Initiative, originally agreed upon at the Beirut Summit back in 2002. The plan has been formed on the basis of the UNSC Resolution of 194.

Attack against a Fama camp in Indelimne: the balance sheet gets heavier ...
02 Nov 2019 by Dakaractu
The assessment of the attack on a camp of the Malian army in Indelimane, in the north-east of the country, near the border with Niger, has increased. According to the Malian Minister of Communication, Yaya Sangare, the reinforcements found 54 bodies including 53 soldiers and 1 civilian. The spokesman of the Malian government added that 10 survivors were recovered by the Fama elements added. Military equipment was destroyed by the attackers, of whom little is known at the moment. But all eyes are turned to terrorist organizations. This attack is one of the most bloody suffered by the Malian army that continues to lend to the jihadist groups that have swarmed in the north and the center of the country for years. In early October, a Malian battalion of the G5 Sahel joint force was attacked in Boulkessy, in the center, near the Burkinabe border. As many as 38 soldiers perished there while in Mondoro, two civilians were killed by the attackers, who later became known to belong to the Islamist and Muslim Support Group (GSIM). Comprising four jihadist organizations including Ansar Dine, Almourabitoune, the Macina Liberation Front and the Aqmi Sahara Emirate, this federation is led by Tuareg Iyad Ag Ghali. In recent months, operations led by Barkhane have neutralized at least two of its leaders, Mohamed Ould Nouini and Yahya Abu El Hamam. Amadou Kouffa who would occupy the second place after Iyad Ag Ghali in this close group affiliated with AQIM, had been announced killed by France. But the jihadist Fulani made a sortie to deny his death.
