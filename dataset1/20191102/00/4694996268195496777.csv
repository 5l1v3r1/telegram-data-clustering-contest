Antes de darse a conocer en las redes sociales, Luisa Fernanda W era una modelo que aparecía en videos musicales de géneros como la ranchera y el reguetón, hasta que se empezó a destacar como instagramer con videos cortos en los que reflejaba la vida de una manera cómica.
Su crecimiento fue tan fuerte que su vida personal pasó a tomar protagonismo, además de las distintas relaciones amorosas en las que ha estado involucrada, siendo novia de Mateo Carvajal y del fallecido cantante Legarda.
Pero, su reconocimiento no es solo por sus contenidos audiovisuales ni por sus rollos amorosos, pues su escultural cuerpo también hace que tenga millones de pretendientes y seguidores en redes sociales.

Admissibility of a possible third term (MBAYE CISSÉ, Jurist)
02 Nov 2019 by Dakaractu
The admissibility of an application relating to a possible third mandate of the President of the Republic, does not suffer from any ambiguity under the Constitution in force adopted by referendum on March 20, 2016.
Therefore, the mandate of 7 years already exercised by the Head of State under the empire of the old constitution is obsolete, over and over. The latter can not be counted successively with the new quinquennium in progress.
The present Basic Charter of the State provides in article 27 that: ""The term of office of the President of the Republic is five years. No one may serve more than two consecutive terms. ""
It should be recalled that this new Constitution abolished the exercise of a 7-year term, and enshrines and sets the principle of term of office at 5 years.
The notion of ""consecutive"" refers to the five-year period. In other words, the President of the Republic is in the process of exercising his first five-year term as stipulated in the said constitution.
Suppose we are in 2024, the mandate outstanding (first term of 5 years under the Constitution of 20 March 2016) has arrived in term, and the President of the Republic submits an application before the judge of the Constitutional Council, this The last in no way resorts to the old constitution to assess its admissibility even less to make the successive alignment of the two constituents, of different sexes, on the basis of two distinct constitutions: (one obsolete, the other in force). The one and only reference text of the seven Sages, however, remains the 2016 Constitution.
At the same time, the possible invocation of the Abdoulaye Wade case law of 2012 will open the route to another five-year term.
The order of the day is that the Head of State must explain this case of third term, but I want to remind that even if the President of the Republic swears on all the sacred texts and is committed before all synagogues and mosques, that will not bind the judge. For the limit of the constitutional judge remains exclusively the Constitution.
Towards a repetition of history
Let us remember modestly President Abdoulaye Wade's statement towards the end of his second term in 2012: ""I locked the Constitution; I can not run for another term ... "", a few years passed, he seized the Constitutional Council which, by decision N ° / E / 2012en dated 27 January 2012, declares the candidacy of the President in question, admissible. So his allegation related to the lockdown of the Constitution refers to a mere political speech that can in no way engage the judge. [1]
Possibility of referral to the Constitutional Council for opinion on the question of a third term
The declaration of a President of the Republic has a legal value, it can also engage the State with regard to the internal Law than with the place of the International Law.
Notwithstanding and of whatever nature, the verbal declarations of a Head of State have no legal value.
On this, to magnify his good faith and give credit to his election promise, he can appeal to the Constitutional Council for an interpretation of the relevant provisions of Article 27 of the Constitution of March 20, 2016.
In the event that the possibility of a second five-year period emerges, a transitional provision may be inserted through an organic law.
In short, it must be recalled that in the new fundamental charter, the constituent retained that: ""Articles 104 to 108 of the Constitution of 22 January 2001 relating to the transitional provisions are repealed."" And Article 104 provides:
""The President of the Republic in office continues his mandate until its term.
All other provisions of this Constitution shall apply to it. ""
