Lalatović: Partizan i Zvezda su prejaki, još kada dobiju mali vetar u leđa...
Stranci prave razliku, a država pomaže večitima ogromnim svotama novca, konstatuje trener Voše

02 Nov 2019

Često je Nenad Lalatović visoko uzdignutih ruku odlazio iz Humske, ali ovog puta je njegov tim potpuno razbijen na crno-beloj strani Topčiderskog brda. Partizan je pregazio Vojvodinu (4:0), pa trener novosadskog tima ne pamti kada je tako loše prošao u okršaju sa Parnim valjkom.
I nije bio Lalatović preterano razočaran posle poraza. Sve se na terenu jasno videlo, da nije imao za čim ni da žali. Dobro raspoložen je izašao pred novinare, utisak je da ga je „zagolicao“ jedino sumnjivi penal iz kojeg je Partizan poveo...„Šta reći kada izgubite 4:0? Krivo mi je što nismo ušli u utakmicu kako sam očekivao, pogotovo mi je krivo za onaj penal, koji ne umanjuje pobedu Partizana, potpuno zasluženu, jer je danas bio daleko bolji tim. Pogotovo je u duel igri bio jači, tu nas nije bilo nigde“, konstatovao je Lalatović.
On je naglasio da su skupo plaćeni stranci ti koji prave razliku u korist večitih rivala u odnosu na ostale u ligi.„Partizan i Zvezda su kvalitetniji od nas, stranci prave ogromnu razliku, Suma, Sadik, Asano... Država pomaže večitim rivalim ogromnim svotama novca, a mi to nemamo. Velika je to razlika. Još ako sudija ne vidi neku sitnicu, ako imaju i taj mali vetar u leđa, onda nemate šta da tražite protiv njih“.
Mnogo više od samog poraza trenera Vojvodine pogađa što njegov tim ne igra dobro.„Ne igramo u poslednje dve utakmice kako možemo, nemamo dovoljno veliki fond igrača da bih mogao da rotiram. Ovo je već 15. utakmica, a nastupa skoro isti tim koji je prošlu sezonu završio na devetom mestu. Da se danas završi sezona, mi bismo zauzeli treće mesto i ja sam time jako zadovoljan. Ipak, postoje stvari koje moraju da se promene, mora da se izgine kada se igra protiv Zvezde i Partizana, a mi smo danas bili gotovo ravnodušni da li će biti na kraju 2:0 ili 4:0“, konstatovao je Nenad Lalatović.

Mahmoud Sadeghi's Comment on Today's Trial: Under the Criminal Code, I Appeal
02 Nov 2019 by Asr Iran

Mahmoud Sadeghi's indictment may be the first legal case of its designers, though he insists he does not accept the charge of propaganda against the system and has given up all of his existence to maintain the authority of the system.

Mahmoud Sadeghi has been summoned to the Revolutionary Court by the complaint of the Deputy Prosecutor of Tehran, but this is not the first complaint against the hopeful MP. Sadeghi says more than 14 complaints have been filed against him.
According to Iran's Times, on his Twitter page, the prosecutor's office also announced the prosecution's charges against him and the post will be held at Branch 4 of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran on charges of propaganda against the regime.

In an interview with The East, he explains the details of the complaint. What is noteworthy in these explanations is to place this charge within the framework of a political crime law, which was passed in 1995 and has not yet been substantiated. Sadeghi says today he will demand this from the judge. This means that the charge against Mahmoud Sadeghi may be the first legal case of its designers, though he insists he does not accept the charge of propaganda against the system and has given up all of its existence to maintain the authority of the system.

In the last days that Tehran's prosecutor was changing, he wrote a detailed letter to Mr. Larijani calling for such a visit. After I went to the prosecutor's office, the indictment was issued, one of which was propaganda against the system. The case was referred to the revolutionary court and the rest was referred to the court for civil servants; however, at a previous hearing, a judge told me that I had been notified of the revolutionary court and would investigate it, but after some time, the court warned. Came"".

""After my mention of the accounts of the judiciary, the prosecutor would sue me every time on an excuse; that's one of them,"" he says.

The complaint was filed around October of last year following allegations that the envoy had tweeted to the head of the Reform administration, but to no avail. However, according to Sadeghi, the MPs' conduct has not recognized the complaint against him within the mandate. ""It was one of those cases that went to the Supervisory Board and it was investigated, but the first year the Supervisory Board acted passively and did not identify more than 10 complaints against me,"" Sadeghi said.

For example, they recognized that they were not within the agency's duties without being able to give me a proper defense and reading the lecture in full. There are a number of other complaints raised by the Supervisory Board, most of which have been identified as representative cases, and some are pending. That's why in the last year, more attention has been paid to the immunity of the delegates. "" The reformist MP also cites 14 other complaints filed against him in the civil servants' court.

It is unclear to what extent some Palestinians' immunity from the law persists, while Karimi Ghodosi, a representative of Mashhad and close to the process of stability, had spied on the speaker and speaker of parliament in a speech in Qom.

""There are 13 or 14 cases in the civil servants' court, of which five are in one case and are related to government bureaucracies,"" he says. There, we requested that the charges be subject to political criminal law, but the court dismissed the case. We also appealed the verdict and the appeal court upheld the original court's opinion. ""

Sadeghi goes on to say: ""The charge must be dealt with within the framework of the political crime law. Tomorrow, we also demand that this accusation be dealt with in the context of political crime. Recently it was announced that Ayatollah Raisi had ordered the formation of a jury for political crimes.

""Of course, we will not accept this accusation, and tomorrow we will defend it, because it is the one who has laid down his whole existence to maintain and maintain the authority of the system,"" he insists. Therefore, these accusations do not stick to us because we are represented in the framework of the constitution and the implementation of the constitution. If there is criticism, it is a violation of the constitution and all our activities are to defend the system and the principles upon which the system is based. ""
