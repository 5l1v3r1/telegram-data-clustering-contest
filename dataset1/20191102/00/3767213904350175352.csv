The best quotes from the first week of Britain’s election campaign
Key lines from the campaign trail

02 Nov 2019


Back to the ballot box

“This House cannot any longer keep this country hostage…It is time for the voters to have a chance to pronounce on [the Brexit deal] and to replace this dysfunctional parliament with a new parliament that can get Brexit done so the country can move on.”

Boris Johnson makes the case for Britain’s third election in little more than four years

""Kate and Anna make music"": cavalcade on free sheet music
02 Nov 2019 by Yannick Marcoux
Philippe Drouin's latest collection of poetry, Kate and Anna make music - in fact a long poem written with one breath - was born from the mesmerizing voices of the McGarrigle sisters. There remains, however, very little of the calm melody of their music, if not a fragmentary intertext that, at best, dictates the measure of a hallucinated writing, whose crazy rhythm ""fuse in the orgiastic cadence"".
This collection closes a cycle on the great musical figures, and the first verses indeed reveal the confused voices of the McGarrigle sisters: ""Kate is Anna is Kate. But it only takes a spark to ignite the powder, and this paraphrase of Gertrude Stein's famous verse throws the poet into a lyrical fury that delights the mic at the famous folk singers. On the hats of wheels, Drouin invites us in his introverted words and, drawing his strength of a resolute love, seeks to overturn everything: ""I want to reign for love. ""




Without wanting to take power, the desire to abolish the established order runs through the poem: ""It's a carnival. / I hear the shots. / The sea goes up and gesticulates. / I remain hail. / Rickety. / I shake the throne. ""
A force emerges from its urgency to say and live, which it is important not to watch. He chose instead to celebrate it, taking care to preserve his freedom: ""I graze the pamphlets. The theses. / I crave gravity / surreal words. ""
At the expense of conventions, the poet claims a disorder and drops the structure of the language: ""I sit on the sky / on the knees of July. / The syntax is nut. / Dismissal. In this path free from his ruts, embracing a certain violence without being dressed in blackness, he pursues the light of fire, its intensity and its power: ""I go to the fire / avenge the night later / with the blindness / for only crown. ""
The poem is a flight forward, sustained, panting, where the words ask to be consumed with bulimia and where ""beauty has a pulse"".

Sideboard of hatched worms

Everything is a matter of rhythm in this series of hatched worms, presented as short sentences starting with a capital letter and ending in a point, creating as many booths for words that, alas, too often suffocate. The proposal is radical and the poet seems to admit that it can shock reading: ""I write by vicissitude. / For no one. ""
Enthusiastic, Drouin gets carried away and, at the climax, one might think that he maintains the desire to undo the words of their senses and to retain only one music, the same one, perhaps, that he Inspire the McGarrigle sisters: ""I give up. / To the meaning. ""
His fervor leads him a little far and they will not be many to follow him. From this cloud of words, however, one draws a beautiful audacity and a seductive invitation to absolute sovereignty: ""Workman's son / I chop the splendors. / I'm starting a march towards revenge. / In swoon. / Ragged. / Faithful and true. ""


Excerpt from ""Kate and Anna make music""
A new rage militates in me. / Brilliantly I saber. / Armored rings. / Cocoon. / Chalk. / Limestone. / Modern modesty. / It torpedoes. / This waterfall. / White of white. / Rose rose. / Black of the world. / Oh ! the partridges. / Oh ! the sentinels. / Kate is at the piano. / Anna closes her eyes.
