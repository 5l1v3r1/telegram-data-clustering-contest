      <h3>Robot Clones</h3>
      <p>Russian startup <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/russia-robot-newscaster-news">Promobot</a> is now selling autonomous androids — and buyers can choose to make the robots look like any person on Earth.</p>
      <p>“Everyone will now be able to order a robot with any appearance — for professional or personal use,” Aleksei Iuzhakov, Chairman of Promobot’s Board of Directors, said in a <a href="https://promo-bot.ai/blog/promobot-launched-mass-production-of-life-like-robots-that-look-like-humans/">press release</a>, later encouraging people to “imagine a replica of Michael Jordan selling basketball uniforms and William Shakespeare reading his own texts in a museum.”</p>
      <h3>Digital Immortality</h3>
      <p>Promobot’s <a href="http://robo-c.ai/">Robo-C</a> can’t walk, but its neck and torso each have three degrees of freedom of movement, according to the <a href="https://promo-bot.ai/production/robo-c/">startup’s website</a>. Its face has 18 moving parts, which allow the robot to produce 600 micro-expressions, and its AI boasts 100,000 speech modules.</p>
      <p>“The key moment in development [of Robo-C] is the digitization of personality and the creation of an individual appearance,” Promobot co-founder Oleg Kivokurtsev <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/31/human-like-androids-have-entered-the-workplace-and-may-take-your-job.html">told <i>CNBC</i></a>. “As a result, digital immortality, which we can offer our customers.”</p>
      <h3>Order Up</h3>
      <p>Promobot <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/31/human-like-androids-have-entered-the-workplace-and-may-take-your-job.html">told <i>CNBC</i></a> it’s already taking orders for Robo-Cs and has started building four robot clones.</p>
      <p>One of the bots will be stationed in a government service center where it will perform several functions, including passport scans. Another will be a clone of Albert Einstein for a robot exhibition.</p>
      <p>The last two, according to the <i>CNBC</i> story, will be robot clones of the father and mother in a Middle Eastern family, which wants the bots for the bizarre purpose of “greeting guests.”</p>
