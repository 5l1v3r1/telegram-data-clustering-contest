Trois mois de convalescence pour Stephen Curry
02 Nov 2019 by Agence France-Presse
Los Angeles — Le joueur étoile des Warriors de Golden State Stephen Curry a été opéré pour une fracture à la main gauche, et en conséquence il ratera trois mois d’activités. L’organisation a précisé vendredi que Curry devrait complètement se rétablir de cette blessure. Le détenteur de deux titres de joueur par excellence de la NBA s’est fracturé la main mercredi, lors du match de saison régulière perdu contre Phoenix (121-110), quand le pivot des Suns, Aron Baynes, s’était écrasé de tout son poids dessus. Le leader des Warriors ne refoulera donc pas les parquets avant février au plus tôt. L’absence de Curry s’ajoute à celle encore plus longue de Klay Thompson, qui soigne, lui, une rupture des ligaments croisés du genou gauche, et au départ à Brooklyn de Kevin Durant, qui formait la dernière pièce du « Big 3 » des Dubs.

Lady Gaga will star in a Ridley Scott film about the crime of the Gucci
02 Nov 2019 by Diario Tecnología



Lady Gaga will star in a film by Ridley Scott about the murder of Maurizio Gucci, a prominent family member who created the famous Italian fashion brand, after her stellar role in ""A Star is Born"" (2018), the media reported Friday specialized Deadline.
Lady Gaga will give life on the big screen to Patrizia Reggiani, who was convicted of ordering the murder of her ex-husband Maurizio Gucci, who was shot by a hitman on March 27, 1995 in front of her company's portal in Milan (Italy).
Reggiani, who always defended his innocence, was sentenced in 1997 to 26 years in prison, but a Milan court decreed his freedom in 2017.
Maurizio Gucci was grandson of Guccio Gucci, founder of Gucci, and directed the brand from 1983 to 1993.
His murder caused commotion in Italian society and the subsequent trial received great coverage from the media.
This film, still without a title, will be Lady Gaga's first film project after the applause she reaped with ""A Star is Born"", a new reinterpretation of this classic Hollywood story that, on this occasion, directed and co-starred Bradley Cooper.
Lady Gaga won the Oscar for best original song for ""Shallow"" and was nominated for the best actress statuette, who went to Olivia Colman for ""The Favorite"" (2018).
The singer was also one of the great protagonists of the last Oscar ceremony thanks to an impressive live performance of ""Shallow"" with Bradley Cooper.
The Gucci movie will feature a screenplay by Roberto Bentivegna and will be based on the book ""The House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamor, and Greed"" by Sara Gay Forden.
Scott, whose last film released to date is ""All the Money in the World"" (2017), is scheduled to shoot the tape ""The Last Duel"" with actors Matt Damon, Adam Driver, Jodie Comer and Ben Affleck.
When the project of ""The Last Duel"" concludes, the British filmmaker will begin the production of the feature film about the Gucci.
