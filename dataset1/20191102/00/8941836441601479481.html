      <p>CLOVIS, N.M. (AP) - A Clovis man who escaped from jail with a detention officer’s help has been sentenced to 30 years in prison.</p>
      <p>The 9th Judicial District Attorney’s Office says 26-year-old Ricky Sena was sentenced Wednesday on convictions for felony escape from jail and other crimes in his 2018 escape with two other inmates from the Curry County Detention Center.</p>
      <p>Detention Officer Sarina Dodson is serving a nine-year sentence after pleading guilty to assist escape from jail.</p>
      <p>Sena’s sentence will run consecutively to an 11-year term for other convictions.</p>
      <p>Authorities said the inmates with Dodson’s help were able to walk out an unlocked jail door.</p>
