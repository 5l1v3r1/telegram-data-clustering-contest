海老蔵　稽古に集中しすぎてラグビー決勝もおっさんずラブも見逃す？「う、無念！」

02 Nov 2019

　歌舞伎俳優の市川海老蔵が２日、公式ブログを更新し、舞台の稽古に集中するあまり、ラグビーＷ杯日本大会決勝の南アフリカ－イングランドも、この日から始まったテレビ朝日系連続ドラマ「おっさんずラブ－ｉｎ　ｔｈｅ　ｓｋｙ－」も見逃してしまったと打ち明けている。
　海老蔵は「う、稽古に集中しすぎてヤッテシマッタ！」と題した投稿で「み、南アフリカ優勝！！！！！！！！実質二位？どゆこと！？！」と、南アの優勝にビックリ。「そして　おっさんずラブ　見過ごしたー」と、両方とも見逃してしまったことを明かした。ただし、「おっさんずラブ」は午後１１時１５分開始で、この投稿は午後９時１３分なので、これは海老蔵の勘違いだと思われる。
　「二つもやってしまった、絶対に見たかった二つを、、、う、無念！」と悔しがった海老蔵、この日は５日に初日を迎える自主公演「ＳＡＮＥＭＯＲＩ」の稽古を行っていた。

Mourning Outpatient Clinic in Bahia offers support to relatives of dead
02 Nov 2019 by The People
For two years now, relatives of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients and wards of the Professor Edgard Santos University Hospital Complex of the Federal University of Bahia, linked to the Ebserh Network (Hupes / UFBA-Ebserh), who lose their relatives are supported. in the period of mourning. At the Mourning Ambulatory, created by the Complex Psychology Service, the goal is to reduce the consequences of grief and provide follow-up to cope with the loss.
According to the psychologist responsible for the outpatient clinic, Monica Venancio, the moment of loss of a loved one involves countless emotions and affections that, although part of the natural repertoire of human emotions, can sometimes present very intense, or even conflicting, and may vary from one individual to another depending on the relationship with the deceased.
""First we make a screening, an initial welcome to assess if there is even a need, then follow-up becomes weekly and when there is a need to call another professional, such as the psychiatrist, we also do this. In some cases, we already accompany family members throughout of the patient's hospitalization when they are terminally ill, ""he said.
The outpatient clinic is not restricted to treating patients with recent losses and may also receive people referred from the Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic who have been suffering longer and more complex grief. ""It's often not a recent loss, but still, the person is still shaken. Sometimes we still have outsiders who have no ties to the hospital but need care.""
According to Monica, in the two years of work, the Mourning Ambulatory has helped people to overcome the loss, which can make the individual sad, emotionally withdrawn, causing him to lose interest in activities that were daily and pleasurable. , including personal relationships.
""This is part of the natural process of grief. The fear we have is that these people do not know how to cope, and it becomes pathological, like a disease. Grief is not a disease, it is crossed by feeling, pain. , for the sadness. It is necessary that the subject goes through this, learns to deal and resignify, to find resources to face the loss and to be interested again in its activities, ""he said.
The psychologist explained that it is necessary to observe if the mourner is resuming his normal activities, if there is no return, it is necessary to consider the possibility that the lake is out of the expected and that perhaps a more intense intervention is needed.
“We realize this when a person begins to suffer losses in their personal, professional, family life. These are cases where the person identifies with the deceased person in such a way that it is as if he or she died together. It is as if there is no desire for life anymore, ""he said.
Monica also stressed that there is no manual on how to deal with a bereaved person, but the recommendation is to accept and endure their pain, allowing the crying and not reducing it to a weakness, as this action reflects the pain of losing someone. that was significant.
""We need to welcome and strive to understand the pain that the bereaved carry, because when we talk stop crying, we are saying that we can not stand listening to him, being there with him crying. He will not stop feeling like crying just because someone is telling him to stop crying. She won't cry in front of you, she'll be in pain for herself, ""he said.
