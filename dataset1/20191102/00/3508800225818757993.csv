02 Nov 2019 by 臺北文創天空創意節


我們想讓你知道的是台灣名導張作驥第9號作品《那個我最親愛的陌生人》，順利入圍金馬最佳導演、女主角、男配角、視覺效果4項大獎，終於要在今年上映，然而這部作品，是張作驥向母親的告別作，也是向過去的致意。

採訪這天，與張作驥導演約在圓山附近的咖啡廳，空氣中瀰漫著濃濃的咖啡味，才坐下打開Menu，他就笑著說起前陣子為了減肥喝防彈咖啡，性急的他為了加速成效，一週喝掉一罐椰子油，然後就送醫院了，「現在不敢喝咖啡了。」張導邊說邊自嘲地笑出聲，隨行的助理一臉無奈，彷彿面對著一個不聽話的調皮老爸，無奈地為他點上一壺熱茶。

台式寫實 說想說的故事
張作驥畢業於文化大學戲劇系影視組，27歲入行，先任職攝影助理，爾後擔任虞戡平導演之助理，之後輾轉進入西門町漢口街的侯孝賢電影社，工作近十年，師事侯孝賢、虞戡平等國際級大導演，累積了扎實的拍片經驗。自承過去話少、不喜多解釋的張作驥，也從靠著寫故事參加比賽維生，逐漸成為講故事的人，最終在35歲那年交出首部劇情長片《忠仔》，從此走上拍電影、講故事的無盡荊棘路。
張作驥的所有電影都是自編自導，一路走來始終堅持說想說的故事，貼身刻劃底層小人物的家庭與日常，拍出真實無欺的生活氣味。1996年上映的《忠仔》，以獨特的影像風格與寫實的敘事，刻寫傳統八家將的家庭與人際，拿下亞太影展、釜山影展的評審團獎，此後，張作驥就成了國內外影展的得獎常客，1999年《黑暗之光》獲得東京影展最高榮譽「東京櫻花大獎」，2002年《美麗時光》獲得金馬獎獲得最佳劇情片，2010年《當愛來的時候》更橫掃金馬獎14項大獎提名，與《香港有個荷里活》並列為金馬獎提名最多的劇情片。

然而，2013年完成電影《暑假作業》後，一則石破天驚的社會新聞震撼整個電影圈，也打亂張作驥的人生，輿論漫天、官司紛飛之際，他不發一言，專心投入拍攝《醉．生夢死》。這是一身粗礪男子氣概的張作驥，首次處理同志議題，交織著他擅長描繪的愛情、親情、友情，絕美的敘事影像與豐富的劇情張力，被公認是他最大膽恣意的作品，上映後撩起社會廣泛討論與思辨，並先後獲得2015年第65屆柏林影展「勝利柱獎」、台北電影獎百萬首獎等六項大獎、及金馬獎最佳女配角、新演員、最佳原創音樂、最佳剪輯等四項大獎的肯定，那年金馬獎的勁敵，是獲得五項大獎的《刺客聶隱娘》。
君不見 高堂明鏡悲白髮
《醉．生夢死》之後，張作驥不得不徹底神隱。儘管如此，他仍持續從不自由的生活中擷取創作靈感，甚至説服台北監獄讓他領著一群不懂演戲、更不懂燈光攝影的囚犯們，拍出了38分鐘短片《鹹水雞的滋味》，然後竟然還成了2017台北電影節「最佳短片獎」得主。同年，張作驥出獄，帶著已經完成的《那個我最親愛的陌生人》劇本，劇情依舊取材自個人生活經驗，描寫罹患阿茲海默症的阿公和他各有盤算的家人，以及阿公追尋真愛的故事。獲得2017金馬創投會議「臺北文創劇作獎」肯定，更在文化部1500萬國片輔導金的支持下準備開拍。
就在緊鑼密鼓籌備的時候，張作驥最掛心的母親開始出現失智症狀，他二話不說將老人家接到身邊24小時貼身照護，把屎把尿完全不假手他人，「母親還清醒的時候曾跟我說，不要把我送去醫院。」 對張作驥而言，親自照顧生病的母親是為人子天經地義、無可推諉的責任，這樣的觀念，也反映在他在電影中，形形色色的主角們無論生活多苦、日子多紊亂，家庭關係總是緊密無法切割的一環。

然而隨著病情惡化，張作驥目睹母親的崩解，感到非常震撼，「我一直以為自己很了解我媽，但她生病後，我卻發現自己並未真正認識她。」 有一次，張作驥在母親面前將手抬起，沒想到張媽媽竟然雙手護頭，一面嚷著「不是我拿的，不要打我」，事後他旁敲側擊，才弄清母親少女時期，曾被哥哥家暴的經歷；又有一次，母親聽到樓下公車的喇叭聲，突然以迅雷不及掩耳的速度，打包行囊、抓起床單棉被作勢跳出窗外，被張作驥急忙攔下的時候，1949年跟著丈夫從海南島逃難來台灣的張媽媽，嘴裡仍緊張的嘟囔著：「快點、快點，船要開了…」。
殘酷的是，母親從現實的時間中抽離越遠，這些張作驥無從知曉的往事就越鮮明，最終吞噬掉所有當下記憶、語言能力、空間感、和尊嚴。2018年5月，張作驥的母親在睡夢中走了，那天也是張爸爸的忌日，「媽媽選擇和爸爸同一天走，可能是擔心我這個又笨又懶的兒子，會忘記父母親的祭日吧。」張作驥這樣認為。

在張作驥的文字、電影中，母親一直佔有重要的位置，辦完後事，他就將工作桌搬到母親離世的房間裡，每天在書寫、發呆、和呼吸之間思念著。喪母兩個月後，他重啟延宕多時的拍片計畫，籌備一年、卻只用了三個月拍攝的《那個我最親愛的陌生人》，並順利入圍金馬最佳導演、女主角、男配角、視覺效果四項大獎，終於要在今年上映。
從一個畫面構思一部電影
不同於一般導演洋洋灑灑的長篇大論或故事靈感，張作驥拍電影通常只是為了讓出現在眼前一個特定畫面被完美呈現。記性極佳的他，興致勃勃地為我們細數催生出每部作品的「畫面」：某一年他在路邊看人「起乩」，暗忖著八家將若看到抗議群眾用自虐方式引人關注，不知作何感想？為了這個念頭，他寫出1號作品《忠仔》。
《忠仔》上片後，張作驥曾短暫中風，經朋友介紹找一位復健師傅，這位盲人師傅每好幾次因為看電影而誤了約定時間，一開始，他心裡狐疑：「盲人怎麼看電影？」還被師傅教訓了一頓。有一天，張作驥跟師傅說：「我拍部電影給你吧！」然後就有了二號作品《黑暗之光》。首映那天，他依約辦了電影唯一的首映場，邀請近百位盲人參與，而吳念真導演擔任辯士（解說員），一位位盲友就這樣手搭手魚貫入場，和導演一起在黑暗中「看」了這部美麗的電影。

五號作品《爸，你好嗎？》則源自張爸爸某次看兒子的電影片段時，突然感嘆說：「怎麼我都聽不懂啊！」原來祖籍廣東的張爸爸，完全不懂電影裡大量出現的台語對白，那個當下，張作驥決定拍一部爸爸聽得懂的電影，拍一部關於爸爸的故事。
平時，張作驥除非必要甚少出門。某年他去香港參加影展，在海產店吃飯時看到酒促小姐，感到非常新奇；後來，他才知道台灣早就有這種職業，專程觀摩幾次後，就寫出了六號作品《當愛來的時候》。
在這個社會上 我不孤獨
從業數十年來，張作驥電影工作室總有各式各樣的員工與實習生來來去去，多半是充滿故事的新銳導演與編劇，他把這些同事當成「家人」，這些「家人」也成了他最強後盾；入獄兩年，都是「家人」主動輪班幫忙照顧高齡的張媽媽；張媽媽生病不肯吃藥，也是「家人」扮演醫生或護士哄騙得逞；就連張作驥想在頂樓養魚，也抓著「家人」幫忙，硬是在陽台砌出一座魚池。因為這些「家人」，身為獨子的張作驥頭一次感到，「在這個社會上，原來我並不孤獨」。

張作驥從不鼓勵有電影夢的年輕人報考相關科系，「唸電影的⋯⋯大部分的時間都在學技術！」他直言，緊湊的生活會讓人失去觀察的能力，年輕人寫不出令人感動的東西，多半也是因為太注重情節鋪陳，看不到細節的緣故。生活的觀察是課堂上沒有辦法學到的！因此，他時常提醒年輕人，拍電影前要先學會感受，從生活中發現帶來感動、矛盾、憤怒、喜悅等等的各種細節。
至於年輕創作者最困擾的資金問題，張作驥直言，他跟過七、八億的大製作、也跟過三百萬的小劇組，開拍第一天，兩個製片第一句話都是：「歹勢，我們這次預算很緊。」錢永遠不夠，但電影的成敗是結果論，跟投入資金多寡未必有直接關係，「想說什麼故事，克服萬難拍出來就對了，太多的藉口是沒有用的。」張作驥始終認為「一個感動人的電影⋯⋯是跟預算沒有關係的！」

He finally handed over his first feature film ""Zhongzi"" at the age of 35, and embarked on it. The endless thorns of making movies and telling stories.
All of Zhang Zuojun’s films are self-directed, and they always insist on telling stories, sticking to the family and daily life of the bottom-level small people, and making a real life-like smell.

However, after completing the film ""Summer Work"" in 2013, a rock-shattering social news shocked the entire film circle and disrupted Zhang Zuojun's life. When the days and the lawsuits flew, he did not say a word and concentrated on shooting ""Drunk."" Dreaming of death. This is a rough and masculine Zhang Zuoyu, the first time dealing with gay issues, intertwined with his love of depiction of love, affection, friendship, beautiful narrative images and rich plot tension, is recognized as his most courageous work, after the release He has made extensive discussions and speculations in the society, and has won six awards including the 65th Berlin Film Festival ""Successful Column Award"", the Taipei Film Awards Million Prize, and the Golden Horse Award for Best Supporting Actress, New Actor, Best Original Affirmation of the four awards such as music and best editing, the enemy of the Golden Horse Award of that year is the ""Assassin Nie Yinniang"" who won five awards.
I don’t see Gao Tang Mingjing sad white hair
""drunk. After the dream of death, Zhang Zuoyu had to completely disappear. Despite this, he continued to draw inspiration from his free life, and even persuaded the Taipei prison to lead a group of prisoners who did not understand acting and did not understand lighting photography. They took a 38-minute short film ""The taste of saltwater chicken."" "", and then even became the winner of the ""Best Short Film Award"" at the 2017 Taipei Film Festival. In the same year, Zhang Zuojun was released from prison, with the completed ""My Dearest Stranger"" script, the plot is still based on personal life experience, describing the Agong who has Alzheimer's disease and his family with his own calculations, and the pursuit of true love. s story. The 2017 Golden Horse Venture Capital Conference ""Taipei Creative Film Award"" was affirmed, and it was ready to start shooting with the support of the Ministry of Culture's 15 million Chinese film.
At the time of intensive preparations, Zhang Zuojun’s most worried mother began to have symptoms of dementia. He said that he would receive the 24-hour personal care from the elderly, and he would not be able to fake the urine. “My mother was still awake when I was with me. Say, don't send me to the hospital."" For Zhang Zuojun, personally caring for a sick mother is a natural and unshirkable responsibility for the Son of Man. This concept is also reflected in his films, the protagonists of all kinds, regardless of life. It’s hard, the days are confusing, and family relationships are always close and impossible to cut.

However, as the condition worsened, Zhang Zuozhen witnessed the disintegration of her mother. She felt very shocked. ""I always thought that I knew my mother very well, but after she became ill, I found that I didn't really know her."" Once, Zhang Zuozhen was in front of his mother. Lifting his hand, I didn’t expect Zhang’s mother to cover her head with both hands, and yelled, “I’m not taking it, don’t hit me.” Afterwards, he knocked on the side to find out the experience of his brother’s family violence. Once, my mother heard the horn of the bus downstairs. Suddenly, she packed her bags and grabbed the sheets and quilt out of the window. When Zhang Zuoqi hurriedly stopped, she fled from Hainan Island to Taiwan in 1949. Ms. Zhang, still muttering in her mouth, ""Hurry up, hurry, the boat is going to open..."".
Cruelly, the farther away the mother is from the real time, the more vivid the past events that Zhang Zuoqi has no knowledge of, and eventually devour all current memories, language skills, sense of space, and dignity. In May 2018, Zhang Zuojun’s mother left in her sleep. It was also the day of Zhang’s father’s jealousy. “Mom chooses to go with her father on the same day. It may be worried that my stupid and lazy son will forget the birthday of his parents. Zhang Zuoyu thinks so.

In Zhang Zuojun's words and movies, the mother has always occupied an important position. After finishing the matter, he moved the work table to the room where his mother died, thinking about writing, daze, and breathing every day. Two months after she lost her mother, he restarted the long-term filming plan and prepared for one year, but only spent three months on ""My Dearest Stranger"", and successfully entered the Golden Horse Best Director and Actress. The four awards, supporting roles and visual effects, will finally be released this year.
Conceive a movie from a picture
Unlike the long-formed or inspiration of the general director, Zhang Zuojun usually only makes films appear in front of a particular picture. With great memory, he eagerly gave us a detailed picture of each work: in a certain year, he saw people on the roadside ""starting"", secretly swearing that eight people would see the protesters The self-abuse method attracts attention, I don’t know what to think about? For this idea, he wrote the No. 1 work ""Zhongzi"".
After ""Zhong Tsai"" was filmed, Zhang Zuojun had a brief stroke. After a friend introduced a rehabilitation master, the blind master missed the appointment time several times because he was watching a movie. At first, he was suspicious: ""How do blind people look? The movie?"" was also taught by the master. One day, Zhang Zuojun said to the master: ""I will give you a movie!"" Then there will be the second work ""Light of Darkness"". On the day of the premiere, he signed the film's only premiere, inviting nearly a hundred blind people to participate, and director Wu Nianzhen served as a clerk (narrator), and a blind friend took the opportunity to join the team and join the director. ""Looking at"" this beautiful movie in the dark.

No. 5, ""Dad, how are you?"" When Zhang’s father watched his son’s movie clip, he suddenly sighed, “How can I not understand it?” Zhang’s father, who was originally from Guangdong, did not understand the Taiwanese dialogue that appeared in the movie. Zhang Zuoyu decided to take a movie that Dad could understand and make a story about Dad.
Usually, Zhang Zuoqi rarely goes out unless necessary. When he went to Hong Kong to participate in the film festival in a certain year, he was very novel when he saw the wine promotion lady at the seafood restaurant. Later, he realized that Taiwan had already had such a career. After a few special trips, he wrote the sixth work. When love comes.""
I am not alone in this society.
In the past decades, Zhang Zuojun’s film studio has a wide range of employees and interns coming and going. Most of them are new directors and screenwriters full of stories. He regards these colleagues as “families” and these “families” have become He is the strongest backing; he was imprisoned for two years and was a ""family"" initiative to help take care of the elderly mother Zhang; Zhang was sick and refused to take medicine, and ""family"" acted as a doctor or nurse to defraud; even Zhang Zuo wanted to raise fish on the top floor. Holding the ""family"" to help, it is hard to build a fish pond on the balcony. Because of these ""families"", Zhang Zuo, who is the only son, once felt that ""in this society, I am not alone.""

Zhang Zuojun never encourages young people with movie dreams to apply for relevant departments. ""Most of the time of filming is learning technology!"" He bluntly said that a compact life would make people lose their ability to observe, and young people could not write. Most of the things that are moving are also because they pay too much attention to the plot and can't see the details. The observation of life is something that can't be learned in class! Therefore, he often reminds young people to learn the feelings before making a movie, and discover various details that bring moving, contradictions, anger, joy, and so on.
As for the most troubled financial problems of young creators, Zhang Zuojun bluntly said that he had followed the big production of 780 million yuan and 800 million, and also followed the 3 million small crew. On the first day of the filming, the first two films were: ""Looking at the situation, our budget is very tight."" Money is never enough, but the success or failure of the film is the result. It may not be directly related to the amount of money invested. ""If you want to tell a story, it will be right to overcome it. There are too many excuses. It’s useless.” Zhang Zuojun always believes that “a touching movie is not related to the budget!”
