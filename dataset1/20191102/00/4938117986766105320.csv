Passenger in an accident: what are the benefits of compulsory motor third-party liability insurance
02 Nov 2019 by Anastasia Vasilieva
In this article we will talk about an accident, and more specifically, about the victim. Many are interested in the question of how to act for a person who suffered in an accident and whether he can wait for CTP insurance payments.





Even the most respectable driver is not immune from road accidents. Sometimes it’s just a coincidence or an evil rock, in the end, you always need to consider the human factor. A passenger can become a participant in the accident, who, by the way, can also be injured in an accident. Is he entitled to any insurance payments in 2019?
Both drivers and passengers, and even pedestrians, can become participants in an accident. The passenger may not drive a car, but at the same time get even more serious injuries than the driver. The injured person has the right to demand compensation from the perpetrator.

The passenger is the culprit of the accident. You must admit that it does not fit in your head how this can happen, but this is a fairly common case. Be that as it may, the culprit of the accident will compensate for damage to property and health. But what is interesting here is that the passenger in this case pays for everything from his own pocket, since such persons are not insured under compulsory motor third-party liability insurance.
The passenger can open the door of the car, into which another car can enter or he can pick up a cyclist. Here various options will be taken into account, because sometimes the one who did not want to prevent a collision will be guilty.
If the passenger was not fastened and at the time of the accident struck another person with his body, then compensation can also be requested from him.
And the most common case is when a passenger who is sitting next to the driver takes control, despite the obstacles of the motorist.
Making an accident with the victims. In such an accident, no one can independently calculate the amount of damage. All participants in an accident need to wait for the traffic police inspector.
The inspector will fill in all the passenger information. If the culprit was the driver, and the passenger was injured, then he may demand pecuniary damage from the insurance company that services the culprit of the accident. In this case, he will need to collect all the necessary documents, without fail you need to take a medical certificate, in which there will be a doctor’s opinion.
Again, if you refuse hospitalization, then it will be difficult for you to prove after a while that the injuries were caused by an accident. If you want to receive payments, then immediately record all abrasions, bruises, etc.
In 2019, the law has three types of damage: - Damage caused to a passenger as a result of an accident. - An accident caused the death of a passenger. - Damage to property. Perhaps because of an accident, one of the participants ruined his clothes, cell phone, etc.
IMPORTANT! If one of the accident participants was injured in health or property in an accident, the Euro protocol cannot be issued.
CTP insurance for the injured passenger. A passenger who has been injured as a result of an accident may receive payments under the compulsory motor liability insurance policy. The costs in this case are borne entirely by the insurance company responsible for the accident.
A car is considered a source of increased danger. Anyone who drives a vehicle must be responsible not only for themselves, but also for those people who ride with him.
We get the payment. The first step is to fix all injuries. Then we go to the insurance company, give all the documents to the specialists and fill out the application. It takes no more than twenty days to review the application. Further, the company must either compensate for the harm to health, or send a reasoned refusal.
Documents: - A certificate of an accident, it can be obtained from the traffic police inspector. By the way, in 2019 it is not issued compulsory. - Medical report. Here you can attach receipts of purchases of drugs for treatment. Perhaps you visited paid doctors, then this also needs to be fixed .- If there are victims, a death certificate, it is issued in the registry office.

Remember that you can apply to the insurance only after the completion of the administrative investigation.

Reimbursement of lost profits. Esland if your vehicle was damaged due to the fault of another person, the owner has the right to compensate for lost profits.
This includes the cost of restoring the car. The cost of the vehicle, as well as the income that the car brought to the owner.
Judicial practice shows that it is very difficult to prove lost profits. But if this is important for you, then you need to collect a package of documents and file a lawsuit in the name of the culprit of the accident.
The harsh truth. Compensation for damage to the injured passenger under compulsory motor third-party liability insurance can only be provided if medical assistance was not provided free of charge. Perhaps the victim needed such medications that no hospital can give out.
