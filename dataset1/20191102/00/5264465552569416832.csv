America: Iran remains the world's leading sponsor of terrorism
02 Nov 2019 by ArabNet - Agencies
Iran remains the world's leading sponsor of terrorism, the State Department said in its 2018 annual report on terrorism, adding that it has spent nearly $ 1 billion on its ""agents."" It also stressed that confronting Tehran's terrorism is a priority for the United States.
The State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Nathan Sills, told a news conference late Friday that the Revolutionary Guards had spent $ 1 billion to support groups linked to it, such as Hezbollah and Hamas.
US sanctions have burdened Hezbollah
""Iran continues to finance terrorist groups in the region,"" Sills said. ""At the same time, he pointed out that the US sanctions have cast their shadow on Hizbullah and weighed down.""
He also confirmed that the US State Department has added about 50 organizations, including Jabhat al-Nusra in Syria and ISIS in Africa, to the terrorism list.
ISIS and lone wolf
With regard to ISIS, he said that his country was doing all it could to combat the individual wolves of the terrorist organization.
ISIS continued to spread globally in 2018 through affiliated networks and groups, despite the US administration's announcement of its victory over ISIS in Syria and the killing of its leader last month in a US raid.

Terrorist tactics and the use of technology have also evolved in 2018, while experienced fighters from groups such as ISIS have begun to pose new threats as they return home.
""Although ISIS has lost almost all of its territory, ISIL has proven its resilience, especially through its efforts to inspire and guide its followers online,"" said Sills, whose report was commissioned by Congress. ""Moreover, terrorists who are experienced in fighting pose new risks after returning home from war zones in Syria and Iraq or traveling to third countries.""
