Researchers Can Combat Cannabinoid Alzheimer's Symptoms
02 Nov 2019 by The People
A group of researchers from the Institute of Biomedical Sciences of the University of São Paulo (USP) managed to fight Alzheimer's symptoms using a cannabinoid compound. The tests showed good results in rats where the early stages of the disease were simulated. The results were published in the journal Neurotoxicity Research.
For the experiments, the synthetic compound ACEA (Araquidonyl-2'-chloroethylamide) was used in animals receiving streptozotocin (STZ) in the brain, which causes a deficiency in neuron metabolism. Then, memory tests were applied to the mice, with object recognition.
New objects are placed in the environment where the animals were. Mice that were not under the influence of the drug explored the sites with the latest news, while those with Alzheimer's kept the same interest throughout the environment. Tests were repeated at one hour and one day intervals to assess short and long term memory.
Results
From then on, rats were treated with ACEA, a synthetic form of one of the compounds extracted from cannabis. It binds to the CB1 receptor, especially present in the hippocampus, a memory-related part of the brain that is affected by Alzheimer's.
According to the study's coordinator, Professor Andrea Torrão, the results of cannabinoid administration were “very positive”. According to the researcher, there was a ""reversal of cognitive deficit"". According to her, this means that the compound was able to prevent the progression of the disease that was simulated at an early stage.
Andrea said ACEA has been used by several research groups around the world, but there are still uninvestigated aspects that the Institute of Biomedical Sciences team has tried to evaluate. “He was well described much more recently. But there were many other questions, gaps, that we wanted to understand, ”he emphasized.
Despite the good results, research on cannabinoids at the institute has stalled. ""Cannabinoid complexes are very expensive for us to care about the budget cuts that have been made in recent years,"" said the researcher. For this reason, the group has been using other substances that act in other aspects of Alzheimer's.
