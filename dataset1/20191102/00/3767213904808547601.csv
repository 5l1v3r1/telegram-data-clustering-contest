The challenges of Francophone Africa and Haiti

02 Nov 2019

Catherine Martellini Special collaboration
This text is part of a special notebook.
In the process of transformation, these states have been using the expertise of Quebec, for example ENAP, for several years, to ensure more effective control of their expenditures and better accountability. How can we help them in their renewed ""business"" vision by rethinking the model with them rather than imposing ours? The needs of French-speaking African countries are numerous and complex. ""They are reviewing their public administration, as Quebec did in the early 1960s,"" says Simon Chabot, director of international affairs at the National School of Public Administration (ENAP). The Lesage government wanted a quality public administration to be the foundation on which to base its action to develop Québec. ""
In his opinion, the governments of French-speaking Africa and Haiti are there today and realize that, without a solid public administration, they will not be able to build and carry out actions, be they economic, environmental or social.
They are also increasingly criticized by the population on the quality of services or corruption in the delivery of services.
""In a country where we went, the GDP knows an increase of 8 to 9% every year whereas the revenues of the State, they, increase of only 1%, illustrates Simon Chabot. This can be explained in particular by the lack of capacity of public administrations to collect taxes, taxes and customs, and thus to capture this enrichment to improve services to the population. ""

Accompany without ""doing in their place""

ENAP has listed the capacity building of public services internationally as one of its lines of intervention since the early 1970s. Its intervention in the countries of the Francophonie intensified in the decade that followed with the financing. training programs and its collaboration with both levels of government. ""This is $ 10 million invested by the Canadian government through ENAP during this period,"" said Mr. Chabot.
Since then, ENAP has been present annually in 80% of French-speaking African countries, notably through training courses in the administrations of African countries and Haiti, a master's program for managers in public administration, human resources management, budgeting, skills assessment and digital governance. ""The North American performance-based model, which comes from Europe, is attracting a lot of interest from them, and they want to build on it, but they have not lost their roots,"" he says.
Indeed, we can not think of applying our model of public administration in these countries by pretending to grasp the functioning of the various bodies. Their socio-cultural environment differs greatly from ours, not to mention their history and mode of governance.
Jean-François Savard, professor at ENAP, went to Haiti three times and quickly realized the need to adapt teaching to the reality of the country. He gives as an example a glossary in Creole he developed with students after finding that they could not understand the concepts, even if they spoke fluent French. ""They live in Creole, and it comes with different realities,"" he says.
These differences include the importance of the voodoo priest in the community. ""We do not talk about voodoo here as we are portrayed in the movies,"" he warns. In a country where governments are often corrupt, people trust the voodoo priest, who has great authority in their community. ""
Thus, if the authorities want to encourage the population to adopt public health measures, they must first convince the priest so that citizens will adhere to it.
This effort to understand, adjust and develop their own model differs from the approaches of other countries, which impose their way of doing things. ""If we do not develop it with them, the appropriation of the model will not happen,"" says Simon Chabot.

Ensuring longevity: the example of Cameroon

Despite all the good will of ENAP to strengthen the capacities of the public administrations of these countries, the results are not always at the rendezvous. ""Some governments are unstable: we can conduct an intervention in a given year and then, the following year, the government has changed or a major social crisis has occurred,"" explains Simon Chabot.
It is in this perspective of sustainability that ENAP lent a hand to the Ministry of Decentralization and Local Development (MINDDEVEL) of Cameroon, which was grappling with a problem of credibility and efficiency in the conduct of the decentralization reform to secure the 360 communes and 14 urban communities in the program.
""The same state-level process a decade before had produced shared results,"" said MINDDEVEL Secretary-General Ebongue Makolle. The support of ENAP was to prevent this kind of results in half-tone. ""
Since September 2018, a support strategy has been rolled out among ministry staff and representatives of local and regional authorities (CTD) through study visits, tailor-made training and technical and methodological tools. No training program of this magnitude had ever been implemented for the benefit of local and regional authorities.
""The project is likely to be sustainable, since the training modules developed by ENAP are particularly suitable for Cameroonian CTDs,"" he adds.
