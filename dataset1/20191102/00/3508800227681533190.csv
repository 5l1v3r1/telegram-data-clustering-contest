安寧緩和專科醫師看「尊嚴善終法案」：潛藏的問題與待解決的癥結點

我們想讓你知道的是日前有一個名為「尊嚴善終法案」在立法院通過一讀，身為安寧緩和專科醫師，在讀完法案內容之後，發現它其實仍有許多癥結點有待討論。

近年來在台灣引起熱烈討論的「安樂死」議題，在數次歷經公投連署未成案之後，日前有一個名為「尊嚴善終法案」在立法院通過一讀。身為安寧緩和專科醫師，在讀完法案內容之後，發現它其實仍有許多癥結點有待討論。
首先在這裡要很明確的聲明：現行的「安寧緩和醫療」、「撤除維生醫療」。它的概念和「安樂死」、「醫師協助自殺」是完全不同的──前者並不會加速或延長病人的死亡，而是讓疾病和老衰回歸到原本的自然進展。但安樂死和醫師協助自殺的前提和目的，則是醫療行為主動、積極的讓病人結束生命。而本人所屬的安寧緩和醫學會，也曾經公開聲明反對安樂死和醫師協助自殺。
以下，將以病人、醫師和第三方人士，予以分析此草案潛藏的問題。
安樂死、醫師協助自殺的前提，是病患要意識清楚、有完全行為能力、罹患末期疾病無法治癒，而且無替代方案可改善或解除，此外還必須排除其他社會、經濟因素。光是這幾點，就需要投注時間和資源對民眾推廣和說明。但草案的第五條居然規定「醫事人員不得主動與病人討論」，這又如何向民眾解釋它和安寧緩和醫療又有何不同？而且並不是每個病人都可以適用。
再者，它既然是醫療行為，勢必要由醫院和醫師來執行。而根據草案第十條，需要有相關的緩和專科團隊、精神心理團隊投入，第十五條更是需要組成審議委員會。相關的學會和機構是否願意和配合、有無適當的人員可勝任皆須考慮，同時它也需要投注相關的醫學教育資源在這一塊上面。
而涉及執行安樂死或協助自殺的醫師，依此條例，雖然不會受到民事、刑事和行政的責任，但仍然可能面臨醫界相關的處分，例如解職、停權、退會以及訴訟和審議期間造成的身心壓力。
最後是病人和醫師以外的利害關係人。安樂死和協助自殺，整個流程下來，光是醫師諮詢、召開委員會審議，還有臨終時給予的藥劑和陪伴，都需要不少的成本，可能達數萬甚至數十萬元。如何訂定收取標準，才不會有牟利或鼓勵的疑慮？死亡診斷書上，死因又該如何呈現？因為這可能直接影響商業醫療保險的給付。
還有一個最根本的問題：此法的目的是合法的殺人與協助自殺，是積極的終結一個人的生命。以目前的草案內容和精神，有沒有辦法避免掉各種蓄意濫用或誤用的可能？程序不完整，文件被偽造，逝去的生命將無法挽回。
在修法之前，請仔細想一想，我們真的準備好了嗎？更何況草案中的立法原由，提到安寧緩和利用率和緩和意願書、病人自主權利法的預立醫療決定簽署率偏低，這代表我們要推行的應該是前二者。而且沒有安寧緩和的善終觀念，根本無法達成安樂死與醫師協助自殺的真正目的。怎麼會捨本逐末，在根基和觀念不穩的情況下就開始推行呢？

Peace and relaxation of specialists to see the ""Dignity and End-of-Life Act"": hidden problems and the crux of the problem to be solved
02 Nov 2019, 00:44 by readers


What we want you to know is that a ""Dignity and End-of-Life Act"" was first passed in the Legislative Yuan. As a peace-relief specialist, after reading the contents of the bill, it was found that there are still many sticks to be discussed.



Text: Dr. Wu Chengyu (Anning and Physician, operating a clinic with a fan group Dong Cuncheng Physician - Dr. Wu Chengyu)
In recent years, the issue of ""euthanasia"", which has caused heated discussions in Taiwan, has been passed through the first reading of the ""Dignity and End-of-Life Act"" in the Legislative Yuan after several cases of unsuccessful referendums. As a gentle and gentle specialist, after reading the contents of the bill, he found that there are still many sticks to be discussed.
First of all, it is necessary to make a clear statement here: the current ""peaceful and palliative care"" and ""the removal of health care."" Its concept is completely different from ""euthanasia"" and ""physician assisted suicide"" - the former does not accelerate or prolong the death of the patient, but returns the disease and old decay to the original natural progress. However, the premise and purpose of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are that medical behavior actively and actively allows the patient to end his life. The Peace and Relaxation Medical Association, which I belong to, has also publicly stated against euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide.
In the following, the hidden problems of this draft will be analyzed by patients, physicians and third parties.
The premise of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide is that the patient should be aware, have full capacity, and can not cure the terminal disease, and no alternatives can be improved or relieved. In addition, other social and economic factors must be excluded. It is only these points that require time and resources to be promoted and explained to the public. However, Article 5 of the draft actually stipulates that ""medical personnel should not take the initiative to discuss with patients."" How does this explain to the public how it differs from peace and palliative care? And not every patient can apply.
Moreover, since it is a medical act, it is necessary to be implemented by hospitals and physicians. According to Article 10 of the draft, it is necessary to have relevant mitigation specialist teams and mental and psychological teams to invest. Article 15 is even more necessary to form a review committee. Whether the relevant institutions and institutions are willing and cooperative, whether there are appropriate personnel to be competent, etc., must also be considered, and it also requires betting related medical education resources on this piece.
Physicians involved in the implementation of euthanasia or assisted suicide, although not subject to civil, criminal and administrative responsibilities, may still face medical-related sanctions, such as dismissal, suspension, withdrawal, and litigation and deliberation Physical and mental stress.
Finally, there are stakeholders other than patients and physicians. Euthanasia and assisted suicide, the whole process down, the consultation of the physician, the deliberation of the committee, and the pharmacy and companionship at the end of the dying, all require a lot of costs, possibly tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of yuan. How do you set a standard for charging without any doubts about profit or encouragement? On the death certificate, how should the cause of death be presented? Because this may directly affect the payment of commercial medical insurance.
There is also one of the most fundamental problems: the purpose of this law is to legally kill and assist in suicide, and to actively end a person's life. With the content and spirit of the current draft, is there any way to avoid the possibility of deliberate misuse or misuse? The program is incomplete, the file is forged, and the lost life will be irreparable.
Before you practice the law, please think carefully, are we really ready? What's more, the legislative reasons in the draft refer to the low signing rate of the pre-established medical decision-making of peace and ease of utilization and mitigation willingness and the patient's autonomy law. This means that we should implement the first two. Moreover, without the concept of hospice and tranquility, it is impossible to achieve the true purpose of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. How can we retreat to the end and start to implement it when the foundation and concept are unstable?
