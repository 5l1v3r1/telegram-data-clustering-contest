過去30年來，基督教如何走入公領域，持續開闢性別議題新戰場？
02 Nov 2019, 00:44 by 辣台妹聊性別


我們想讓你知道的是從台灣公民參與及社會轉型的歷程來看，基督教走向公共議題的過程未必需要全盤否定。首先，基督教的黑盒子打開了，大眾對於基督教的關注程度前無僅有，教會內部的積習與觀念逐一被攤在陽光下檢視。



文：林紘晟
10月26日就是2019年的台灣同志遊行，也是同性婚姻法制化之後的第一個同志遊行。同婚合法的這條路走了30多年，最近幾年尤其激烈，面對反同方鋪天蓋地的宣傳策略，民間性平組織必須在資源相對稀少的條件下持續動員，迎擊反同方的流言與惡意。
同婚法制化值得慶祝。但是，從性平教材的攻防戰，到10月23日心跳法案的聽證會，我們都看見基督宗教動員勢力並沒有停歇，他們持續站在去年公投的群眾基礎之上，開闢性別議題的新戰場。
因此，站在這個時間點上，我們想要回頭談一個基本的發問：「基督教如何走入公領域，又如何產生巨大的影響力呢？」經由這個問題，我們希望這篇文章不只是一篇「知己知彼」的教戰手冊，更希望能重新思考，挺同與反同方的論述攻防為台灣社會帶來了什麼、犧牲了什麼，我們下一步又能去哪裡呢？
1949 - 1990：國語教會掌握需求，掌握群眾
基督教走入公領域的契機，必須從教會與台灣社會變遷談起。
戰後，與國民黨一同來台的國語教會，藉由豐富的人力與醫療資源快速成長。但是，從1965年開始，當台灣邁入產業轉型與經濟起飛，人們對於物質與醫療資源的需求降低，一向以物質及醫療援助為宣教手段的教會，陷入了成長停滯、爭奪信徒與組織分裂的低迷時期。
1990 年代是轉捩點。國語教會逐漸在城市扎根，透過信徒組成的「細胞小組」（cell group）打造信徒之間互相傾聽與扶持的管道，吸納在經濟發展與都市化過程中感到無所依靠的群眾。教會改變宣教方式，以活潑氣氛、流行風格的歌曲取代莊嚴儀式，吸引年輕人禮拜，又以「成功神學」將世俗成就包裝為上帝祝福，吸引商業與政界的中產階級成功人士。
此外，眾多教會以「國度復興」為共同目標，結束了以往單打獨鬥的分裂局面，轉而以國家為層級進行教義宣傳。教會之間成立聯合組織，佳音廣播電台、好消息電視台與國度復興報等媒體平台也爭相成立。
此時的國語教會打破了地域與教派的隔閡，握有豐厚資源與扎實的群眾基礎，這些都有利於日後大規模的動員行動。
1990 - 2000：外交危機，人權轉機
2000年是意義重大的一年：台灣第一次政黨輪替，民進黨開始執政。同一年，時任台北市長的馬英九首度以公部門預算舉辦「台北同玩節」，前總統陳水扁也接見了國際級LGBT倡議人士，是政府公開支持同志權益的重大里程碑。
政府支持同志權益並非歷史偶然。自詡為「中國道德與文化傳承者」的中華民國政府，經歷了1970 - 1980年代的外交危機，世界各國紛紛與中共建交之後，「文化傳承者」的招牌逐漸掛不住。於是，政府轉而以「亞洲少數民主國家」的身份自居，努力接軌歐美進步價值，以此區別中華民國與威權專制的中共政權。
同志權益是西方進步價值的重要指標。在時代趨勢的推波下，馬英九連續多年用公家預算支持同志活動，更在 2003年舉辦第一屆台北同志遊行，是華人地區首例。該年的聯合報寫道「馬英九認為市民都是平等的，台北市要打造成世界級首都，同志就要得到世界級的尊重」，政府支持同志運動的背後，提升台北（乃至於台灣）世界形象的企圖鮮明。
政府積極挺同，逼得國語教會強烈表態。在第一屆同玩節之後，多個基督教派年共同簽署了一份請願書，表示「同性戀在上帝的標準是罪，需要悔改」、「台灣社會和教會界應接納同志群體，協助他們脫離困擾」。
相較於今日，當時基督教的論述與策略相當粗糙。例如，2006 年新店行道會牧師張茂松，公開評論台北市府的作為「助長同性婚姻，將讓台北市成為聖經中另一個被上帝詛咒而滅亡的索多瑪及蛾摩拉城」。諸如「上帝詛咒」、「索多瑪與蛾摩拉」等詞彙，顯示當時的基督教雖然公開反同，卻受限於宗教語彙，未能觸及非基督教的廣泛大眾。
2000 - 2010：教會走向公眾，論述策略轉型
2000年初的反同宣傳主要由「台灣走出埃及輔導協會」主導，該組織將同性戀視為疾病，需要接受聖靈洗禮方能治療。基督教約佔台灣人口的5%，這樣的道德訴求與詞彙當然難以引起大眾迴響。
然而，這個現象在2010年後劇烈轉變，轉型後的基督教掌握了成熟的策略與修辭技巧，將宗教訴求接軌台灣既有價值觀念，凝聚成巨大的反同勢力。
2010年後，一群來自不同領域，帶著豐厚商界與政界資源的基督徒，開始與基督教會的宗教領導者密切合作。他們追隨美國極右派牧師Peter Wagner的著名理論：發起屬靈戰爭，轉化七座社會山頭（宗教、家庭、教育、政府、媒體、藝術、經濟），由此積極發展出更靈活的運作策略、新的動員策略，以及更有說服力的論述框架。
2011年，他們成立了「中華二十一世紀智庫協會」。第一任理事長是曾任奧美集團董事長的白崇亮，他在一場基督教茶敘中說道，智庫希望能「以《聖經》真理進行深入探討，用跳脫宗教面貌的語言發表專業論述」，並且「期許在宗教、媒體、政府、家庭、教育、藝術、經濟七大山頭中，讓聖經真理發揮影響力」。
2010後：去宗教的修辭策略
在新的修辭技巧中，基督教的身份被淡化，例如2014年「台灣宗教團體愛護家庭大聯盟」的記者會中，第一排坐滿了佛教、道教、一貫道等宗教團體代表，企圖淡化基督教領導的色彩，營造出傳統信仰集結的氛圍。
基督教徒也轉換身份，以專家、學者、教育工作者等不同角色發言，不再以負面論述否定同志，而是以「關懷」家庭價值與兒童福祉為包裝，激起非基督徒的共鳴與不安情緒。
更甚者，基督教團體利用跨虹者（曾為同性戀，而後「變回」異性戀）佯裝人權團體，假借多元性別訴求保守思想。就在10月22日，國際跨虹聯盟（GRCA）現身圓山飯店的「國際人權聯盟40週年年會」現場，以「敢於不同，自由選擇」為口號，控訴衛福部禁止性傾向扭轉治療是「扼殺了跨虹者的人權」。
最後，「自我受害者化」是常見策略。香港明光社的關啟文教授是東亞地區的指標性反同運動者，曾數次來台灣演講，諸如「逆向歧視」、「沈默的大多數」等論述就是由他而來。
在自我受害者化的論述之下，同志運動群體被描述為好戰、壓迫他人的少數，企圖破壞和諧的婚家想像，基督徒與其他群眾是「溫和而沈默的多數」，支持同志權益的政府與媒體則是助長少數壓迫多數的幫凶。

2018 - 2020：開闢新的議題戰場，保守勢力大反撲
靈活的論述能力加上基督教穩固的群眾基礎，讓教會組織能大力介入政治領域。2018年底的公投中，下一代幸福聯盟的三項提案都拿下超過60%的同意票，普遍被視為同運的大挫敗，公投後也陸續傳出LGBTQ+族群輕生的消息。
今年5月17日，立法院透過專法形式將同性婚姻法制化。支持同志的群眾一片歡喜，安定力量等組織則批判蔡政府曲解釋憲、藐視民意與公投結果。
同性婚姻的戰場暫時落幕，群眾對於相關議題的關注逐漸冷卻。然而，基督教團體並沒有停歇，持續在不同領域開啟戰場。光是本週，10月21日國際跨虹聯盟控訴衛福部忽視人權，10月23日是心跳法案的公投聽證會，10月24日是性平教育法的修訂公聽會。
其中，心跳法案以保護生命為由，欲將合法流產期縮短到八週，嚴重侵害女性的身體自主，以及忽略受暴懷孕與胎兒發展異常等狀況。提案人彭迦智更直接表明「照理說，是從懷孕開始就不應該墮胎」，八週對他而言是「一個最低的底線，希望至少胎兒有心跳的時候不要墮胎」。
「性別平等教育法施行細則草案」的修訂公聽會中，曾獻瑩（去年公投提案人之一、下一代幸福聯盟理事長）也強調自己不歧視，只是不希望教育變成「某種意識形態的推廣」。
最後，安定力量也於九月底宣布投入2020立法委員選舉，已經公布了10位區域立委候選人。基督教會從尋找「政治代理人」的策略轉向親自參選，能獲得多少成果還是未知數。不論當選與否，教會掌握的聲量越大，必然會壓縮LGBTQ+族群的生存空間，基督教會的參政情況仍需要密切關注。
結語
概要回顧了1990至今基督教走入公領域的過程。在這30年中，靠著同運組織與個人的努力，同性婚姻從無到有，而基督教的反對與壓迫也從來沒有缺席。因為基督教而凝聚的社會惡意，也在許多的家庭或個人上留下無法抹滅的傷痕。
不過若將尺度拉遠，從台灣公民參與及社會轉型的歷程來看，基督教走向公共議題的過程未必需要全盤否定。首先，基督教的黑盒子打開了，大眾對於基督教的關注程度前無僅有，教會內部的積習與觀念逐一被攤在陽光下檢視，例如「彩虹媽媽」入校上課的慣習，其實從1990年政府推行生命教育開始就已經存在，但時至今日才受到更多監督，提升為重要的公共議題。
當基督教會大力動員，與教會領導者不同的意見也逐一浮現。許多教友並不認同教會反對同志權益的立場，有些人退出教會，或是以教友身份為同志發聲，例如長老教會青年陣線在捍衛同志議題上就從未退縮。1996年成立的同光教會，更承受了巨大壓力，一路陪伴同志走了20多年。這些異質的聲音扮演正反方重要的溝通橋樑，也能打破大眾對於基督徒過度單一的想像。
另外，5%的基督徒可以拿到超過60%的公投選票，許多支持者是沒有強烈宗教傾向的「一般人」，這也顯示了台灣性別平等議程中，國家與民眾的腳步並不同調。當民間組織與政府不斷推動法規，將台灣打造成東亞性別平權的指標國家，卻未有足夠的資源與時間讓性平觀念在台灣社會深深扎根。
台灣是個票票等值的民主國家。這意味著，不論是同性婚姻、性別教育、人工流產，或是其他性別議題，單單依靠國家與倡議組織的推動是不夠的。如同公投之前，許多支持同志的朋友努力回到生活圈，嘗試向不同背景人說明性別平等的理念與重要性，一個更為包容、平等的公民社會，就是在人們願意溝通與理解的時候緩緩邁步向前。
最後，在提倡性別平等的巨大範疇中，不平等仍舊存在。在基督教會與同運組織全力動員之下，同性婚姻獲得了前所未有的群眾基礎與資源。但是為了提升社會對LGBTQ+族群的接納程度，諸如愛滋污名、跨性別、BDSM 乃至於非典型親密關係等議題幾乎完全被壓在檯面之下。
基督教會對性別議題的介入，並不會只限於同性婚姻。在追求性別平等的路上，反對勢力的增長也不只威脅到一種人。因此，我們除了用「無法改變」作為性別平等的訴求之外，是不是能有更積極的作為，不只是將「沒有人受到壓迫」當作目標，而是以一個「每個人都能活出自己最喜歡的樣子」作為藍圖，廣納盟友一起解開性別的框框架架。

In the past 30 years, how has Christianity entered the public domain and continued to open up new battlefields on gender issues?
02 Nov 2019, 00:44 by spicy girl talking about sex


What we want you to know is that from the perspective of Taiwanese citizen participation and social transformation, the process of Christianity moving toward public issues does not necessarily need to be completely negated. First of all, the black box of Christianity was opened, and the public's attention to Christianity was unprecedented. The internal learning and concepts within the church were examined one by one in the sun.



Text: Lin Wei
October 26th is the 20th Taiwan comrade parade, and the first comrade parade after the legalization of same-sex marriage. This road of legal marriage has been going on for more than 30 years. In recent years, it has been particularly fierce. In the face of the overwhelming propaganda strategy of the anti-same parties, the non-governmental organizations must continue to mobilize under the conditions of relatively scarce resources to meet the rumors and maliciousness of the anti-same parties.
Legalization of marriage is worth celebrating. However, from the offensive and defensive battles of the Sexuality textbooks to the hearings of the Heartbeat Act on October 23, we all saw that the Christian mobilization forces did not stop. They continued to stand on the masses of last year’s referendum and opened up new battlefields on gender issues. .
Therefore, standing at this point in time, we want to go back and talk about a basic question: ""How does Christianity enter the public domain and how does it have a huge impact?"" Through this question, we hope that this article is not just an article. The teaching manual of ""Knowing ourselves and knowing each other"" is more eager to rethink. What is the difference between the offense and defense of the same and the opposite party and what has been sacrificed for Taiwan society? Where can we go next?
1949 - 1990: The Mandarin Church grasps the needs and masters the masses
The opportunity for Christianity to enter the public sphere must begin with the changes in the church and Taiwan society.
After the war, the Mandarin Church, which came to Taiwan with the Kuomintang, grew rapidly with abundant human and medical resources. However, since 1965, when Taiwan entered industrial transformation and economic take-off, people's demand for material and medical resources has decreased. The church, which has always used material and medical assistance as a means of education, has fallen into a stagnant growth, vying for believers and organizational division. Downturn.
The 1990s was a turning point. The Mandarin Church is gradually taking root in the city. Through the ""cell group"" composed of believers, it creates a channel for mutual listening and support among believers, and absorbs the people who feel unreliable in the process of economic development and urbanization. The church changed the way of teaching, replacing the solemn rituals with lively and popular style songs, attracting young people to worship, and packaging the secular achievements as God's blessings with ""successful theology"" to attract middle-class successful people in business and politics.
In addition, many churches have adopted the ""national rejuvenation"" as a common goal, ending the split situation of the past single-handedly fighting, and instead propagating the teachings at the national level. A joint organization was established between the churches, and media platforms such as Jiayin Radio, Good News TV and National Fuxing Daily also rushed to establish.
At this time, the Mandarin Church broke the gap between the region and the sect, and it has rich resources and a solid mass base, which are conducive to large-scale mobilization in the future.
1990 - 2000: diplomatic crisis, human rights turnaround
The year 2000 was a significant year: Taiwan’s first political party rotation and the DPP began to rule. In the same year, Ma Ying-jeou, then the mayor of Taipei, held the ""Taipei Festival"" for the first time with the public sector budget. Former President Chen Shui-bian also met with international LGBT advocates, which was a major milestone for the government to openly support the rights and interests of comrades.
Government support for gay rights is not a historical accident. The government of the Republic of China, which is known as the ""Chinese ethics and cultural inheritor"", experienced the diplomatic crisis of the 1970s and 1980s. After the countries of the world established diplomatic relations with the Chinese Communist Party, the signs of ""cultural heritage"" gradually disappeared. As a result, the government turned to the status of ""a few democratic countries in Asia"" and tried to connect with the progressive value of Europe and the United States to distinguish between the Republic of China and the authoritarian regime of the Chinese Communist Party.
Gay rights and interests are an important indicator of the value of progress in the West. Under the push of the trend of the times, Ma Ying-jeou has supported the gay activities with the public budget for many years. He also held the first Taipei gay parade in 2003, which is the first in the Chinese region. The joint report of the year wrote that ""Ma Ying-jeou believes that citizens are equal, Taipei City must become a world-class capital, and comrades must receive world-class respect."" The government supports the gay movement and promotes the world of Taipei (and even Taiwan). The image is an obvious attempt.
The government has actively agreed to force the National Language Church to express its strong position. After the first festival, several Christian Years signed a petition stating that ""the standard of homosexuality in God is sin and needs repentance."" ""Taiwan society and the church community should accept comrades and help them to break away."" Troubled.""
Compared to today, the Christian discourse and strategy were quite rough. For example, in 2006, Zhang Maosong, a pastor of the New Store Walkway, publicly commented on the Taipei City's role as ""promoting same-sex marriage, which will make Taipei City another Sodom and Gomorrah City in the Bible that was cursed and destroyed by God."" Words such as ""God's Curse"", ""Sordo and Gomorrah"" show that Christianity at the time, although openly opposed, was limited by religious vocabulary and failed to reach a wide range of non-Christian people.
2000 - 2010: Churches go to the public and discuss strategic transformation
The anti-aggression in early 2000 was mainly led by the ""Taiwan Out of Egypt Counseling Association"", which treats homosexuality as a disease and needs to be baptized with the Holy Spirit to be treated. Christianity accounts for about 5% of Taiwan's population. Such moral appeals and vocabulary are of course hard to resonate with the public.
However, this phenomenon changed drastically after 2010. After the transformation, Christianity mastered mature strategies and rhetorical skills, and connected religious demands to Taiwan's existing values and condensed into huge opposing forces.
After 2010, a group of Christians from different fields with rich business and political resources began to work closely with the religious leaders of the Christian Church. They follow the famous theory of the far-right American pastor Peter Wagner: launching a spiritual war and transforming seven social hills (religion, family, education, government, media, art, economy), thereby actively developing a more flexible operational strategy, new Mobilization strategies and a more convincing framework for discussion.
In 2011, they established the ""China 21st Century Think Tank Association."" The first chairman was Bai Chongliang, who was the chairman of Ogilvy & Mather. He said in a Christian tea narrative that the think tank hopes to ""deeply explore the truth of the Bible and publish professional discourse in a language that escapes the religious face."" And ""expected to make the Bible truth exert influence in the seven hills of religion, media, government, family, education, art, and economy.""
After 2010: Rhetorical Strategy of Going to Religion
In the new rhetorical skills, the identity of Christianity has been diluted. For example, in the 2014 ""Taiwan Religious Groups Care for Family Alliances"" press conference, the first row was filled with representatives of religious groups such as Buddhism, Taoism, and consistent Taoism in an attempt to downplay Christian leadership. The color creates an atmosphere of traditional faith gathering.
Christians also change their identities and speak with different roles such as experts, scholars, and educators. They no longer negate their comrades with negative discourse, but instead use the ""care"" family values and children's well-being as a package to arouse the resonance and anxiety of non-Christians. mood.
What's more, Christian groups use cross-Hungarians (who used to be homosexual and then ""changed back"" heterosexuals) to pretend to be a human rights group, and to use multiple genders to pursue conservative thinking. On October 22nd, the International Cross-Hong Kong Alliance (GRCA) appeared at the ""International Human Rights League 40th Anniversary Annual Meeting"" at the Round Mountain Hotel. With the slogan ""Dare to be different, free choice"", the lawsuit was filed against the Ministry of Health and Welfare to prohibit sexual orientation. ""Scrapping the human rights of the cross-ishers.""
Finally, ""self-victimization"" is a common strategy. Professor Kwan Kai-wen of Hong Kong Mingguang Society is an indicator of anti-same movements in East Asia. He has spoken in Taiwan several times, such as ""reverse discrimination"" and ""silent majority"".
Under the self-victimization theory, the gay movement group is described as a minority of militant and oppressive others, attempting to undermine the harmonious marriage imaginary, Christians and other masses are ""moderate and silent majority"", supporting the rights of comrades. The government and the media are helping an accomplice of the oppressed majority.

2018 - 2020: Opening up new battlefields, conservative forces counterattack
The flexible discourse and the solid mass foundation of Christianity allow church organizations to intervene in the political arena. In the referendum at the end of 2018, the three proposals of the Next Generation Happiness Alliance won more than 60% of the votes, which was generally regarded as a big defeat in the same movement. After the referendum, news of the LGBTQ+ group was also reported.
On May 17 this year, the Legislative Yuan legalized the same-sex marriage through special law. The masses who support the comrades are happy, and the organizations such as the stability forces criticize the Cai government's interpretation of the constitution, contempt for public opinion and the results of the referendum.
The battlefield of same-sex marriage ended temporarily, and the public’s attention to related issues gradually cooled. However, the Christian community did not stop and continued to open battlefields in different fields. This week alone, on October 21st, the International Cross-Hong Alliance accused the Weifu Department of ignoring human rights, October 23 was the referendum hearing of the Heartbeat Act, and October 24 was the revised public hearing of the Sexual Education Act.
Among them, the Heartbeat Act is intended to protect the life, to shorten the legal abortion period to eight weeks, seriously infringe on women's physical autonomy, and ignore the situation of violent pregnancy and abnormal fetal development. The proponent Peng Jiazhi even more directly stated that ""it is reasonable to say that it is not abortion from the beginning of pregnancy."" Eight weeks is ""the lowest bottom line for him. I hope that at least the fetus will not have an abortion when it has a heartbeat.""
In the revised public hearing of the ""Draft Implementation Rules for the Gender Equality Education Law"", Zeng Xianying (one of the sponsors of the referendum last year and the chairman of the next generation happiness association) also stressed that she does not discriminate, but does not want education to become ""a certain kind of ideology promotion."" "".""
Finally, the stability forces also announced the election of the 2020 Legislative Council election at the end of September, and 10 regional legislator candidates have been announced. It is still unknown how much the Christian Church will move from looking for a ""political agent"" strategy to personal election. Regardless of whether elected or not, the greater the volume of the church's mastery will inevitably reduce the living space of the LGBTQ+ group. The participation of the Christian Church in politics still needs to be closely watched.
Conclusion
The summary reviews the process of Christianity entering the public domain since 1990. In these 30 years, by the efforts of organizations and individuals in the same movement, same-sex marriage has never been there, and Christian opposition and oppression have never been absent. The social malice condensed by Christianity also leaves indelible scars on many families or individuals.
However, if the scale is extended, from the perspective of Taiwanese citizen participation and social transformation, the process of Christianity moving toward public issues does not necessarily need to be completely negated. First of all, the black box of Christianity has opened up. The public's attention to Christianity is unprecedented. The internal learning and concepts of the church are being examined in the sun one by one. For example, the habit of ""Rainbow Mom"" entering the school is actually implemented by the government in 1990. Life education has existed since its inception, but it has only received more supervision and promotion as an important public issue.
When the Christian Church mobilized, different opinions from the church leaders emerged one by one. Many members of the church do not agree with the position of the church against the rights of comrades. Some people withdraw from the church or speak for comrades as members of the church. For example, the Youth Front of the Presbyterian Church has never retreated in defending comrades. The Tongguang Church, established in 1996, has withstood tremendous pressure and has been with the comrades for more than 20 years. These heterogeneous voices play an important communication bridge between the pros and cons, and can also break the public's over-simple imagination of Christians.
In addition, 5% of Christians can get more than 60% of the referendum votes. Many supporters are ""average people"" who have no strong religious inclinations. This also shows that the national and people's footsteps are different in Taiwan's gender equality agenda. When civil organizations and the government continue to promote regulations and make Taiwan an indicator of gender equality in East Asia, they do not have sufficient resources and time to make the concept of sexuality deeply rooted in Taiwan society.
Taiwan is a democratic country with the same votes. This means that whether it is same-sex marriage, gender education, abortion, or other gender issues, it is not enough to rely solely on the promotion of the state and the initiative. As before the referendum, many friends who supported comrades tried to return to the life circle and tried to explain the concept and importance of gender equality to different backgrounds. A more inclusive and equal civil society is slow when people are willing to communicate and understand. Step forward.
Finally, in the vast category of advocating gender equality, inequality still exists. Under the full mobilization of the Christian Church and the Organization of the Same Movement, same-sex marriage has gained an unprecedented mass base and resources. However, in order to promote the acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community, topics such as AIDS stigma, transgender, BDSM and even atypical intimacy are almost completely under the table.
The involvement of Christianity in gender issues is not limited to same-sex marriage. On the road to gender equality, the growth of opposition forces does not only threaten one type of person. Therefore, apart from using ""unable to change"" as a gender equality appeal, can we have more positive actions, not just ""no one is oppressed"" as a goal, but a ""everyone can live out"" ""My favorite look"" as a blueprint, the ally of allies to unravel the framework of the frame of gender.
