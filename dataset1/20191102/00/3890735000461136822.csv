Terminator. Sombre destin (V.F. de Terminator: Dark Fate)
02 Nov 2019 by Manon Dumais



Au dire de James Cameron, producteur de la lucrative franchise, ce sixième volet de Terminator serait la suite directe de Terminator 2. Le jugement dernier, le meilleur de la série. Or, par endroits, on croirait un remake à saveur féministe de T2 tant son récit s’y apparente. De fait, on y retrouve une femme sans histoire (Nathalie Reyes) qui reçoit deux visiteurs du futur : un Terminator (Gabriel Luna) qui veut l’éliminer et une super-soldate (Mackenzie Davis) qui veut la protéger. Au plus grand plaisir des fans, Linda Hamilton et Arnold Schwarzenegger reprennent respectivement les rôles de Sarah Connor et de T-800. Vingt-huit ans plus tard, tous deux affichent une forme plus qu’enviable. Lui qui avait ébloui la galerie avec le spectaculaire Deadpool, Tim Miller paraît ici bien sage. Sans temps morts, bénéficiant d’effets spéciaux convaincants, sa réalisation enchaîne habilement scènes de poursuite, de fusillades et de combats musclés, sans pour autant surpasser le T2 de Cameron.Notre critique complèteHoraire en salles

Reassuring messages do not obscure the turmoil of Lebanese banks
Hundreds demonstrate in front of the Central Bank of Lebanon to denounce its policies and reject the imposition of taxes on workers.

02 Nov 2019

BEIRUT - Hundreds of Lebanese protested on Saturday against the Central Bank of Lebanon (CBE).
Other sources quoted clients as saying they had faced new restrictions on remittances.
""Lebanese banks did not witness any unusual movements of funds on Friday and Saturday after they remained closed for two weeks due to protests across the country,"" Sfeir said.
""The reaction was almost what we expected and anticipated. Nevertheless, people were asking a lot of questions and giving as many assurances as possible.""
""This is important given the length of the closure and the events in our country.""
""We are trying to counter the rumors and avoid panic to prevent any unnecessary and unjustified withdrawals.""
Salameh said that ""the reopening of banks has not caused any problems in any bank,"" adding, ""No formal restrictions on capital are being considered.""
Analysts and bankers cited widespread concerns that depositors could quickly withdraw their savings and transfer them abroad when banks reopen.
Protests broke out across the country on October 17 and plunged Lebanon into a political crisis as it struggled to cope with the worst economic crisis since the civil war. The protests led to the resignation of Prime Minister Saad Hariri last week.
""There were no formal restrictions on capital movements when banks reopened on Friday, but customers faced new restrictions on remittances and withdrawals from dollar accounts,"" bankers and clients said on Friday.
""We are not considering formal restrictions on capital,"" Salameh said, stressing that such a measure would require a vote in parliament.
""Banks are dealing with the situation in a professional manner and the central bank supports it.""
""Branch operations are going better than expected,"" a banking source said.
The Lebanese News Agency reported that a demonstration started from Riad El Solh Square in central Beirut and reached the headquarters of the Banque du Liban. the money"".
Lebanese banks opened on Friday for the first time in two weeks after life returned to normal, following popular protests across Lebanon to demand the departure of the political class.

















The unprecedented protest movement for years has caused complete paralysis in the country, including the closure of banks, schools and universities and cutting off major roads in all areas.
Life returned to normal in the country on Friday as protesters got out of the streets and recorded an active traffic in the morning. Downtown Beirut and the northern cities of Tripoli in the north and Sidon in the south witnessed mainly limited demonstrations in the usual squares.
Since early morning, banks have been overwhelmed by citizens who wanted to hold their two-week banking transactions or withdraw their salaries at the start of the month.
Citizens formed huge queues, sometimes out of banks in the capital Beirut, while a number of security elements stood in front of some banks.
The waiting halls inside the banks could not accommodate everyone, and a large number of citizens were waiting for their turn while the employees were facing difficulties in providing services to them.
""Many transactions have been piled up from the last two weeks due to the closure, but there has been no panic,"" said Nassib Gabriel, head of research at Byblos Bank Group.
Citizens fear that the Lebanese pound will collapse against the dollar as soon as banks open their doors as demand increases, but the official exchange rate of the pound against the dollar remains at 1507.
In the parallel market, the exchange rate exceeded 1700 pounds as banks continue to limit the sale of dollars, which can be used in Lebanon in parallel with the lira in all banking and commercial operations.
In parallel, the political scene remains blurred three days after the resignation of Prime Minister Saad Hariri following the protests in which hundreds of thousands of Lebanese participated, demanding the speedy formation of a new government they want from technocrats, independents and outside the current political class.
Hariri resigned as protests continued despite a paper of economic reforms announced in the first week of popular action.
On Thursday, Lebanese President Michel Aoun called on Hizbollah to form a new government of ministers ""competent and experienced"" and not ""in accordance with political loyalties and appeasement of leaders.""
On Friday, Hizbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who opposed Hariri's resignation as his main political opponent, called for a swift formation of the government, without specifying what it would be and whether the party would agree to its formation from technocrats in isolation.
In a televised speech, Nasrallah said: ""The caretaker phase must be reduced, because if it is prolonged, this is the vacuum. The caretaker government will not be able to pass laws or reforms.""
""Today, it is the responsibility of all Lebanese political forces, parliamentary blocs, parties and the Lebanese people of all categories to push for a vacuum of power and to form a new government as soon as possible.""
In a previous speech, Nasrallah considered that the technocrat government ""cannot stand two weeks.""
Demonstrators in Lebanon stress that their ""revolution"" is not only aimed at overthrowing the government, and that they continue in it until all their demands to change the political class and save the economic situation.
These moves are unprecedented against the backdrop of living demands in a small country burdened with indebtedness, corruption and quotas. No region, sect or leader was excluded.
Lebanon is witnessing a deterioration in its economic situation, manifested by almost zero growth last year and the accumulation of debt to $ 86 billion, equivalent to 150 percent of GDP, one of the highest rates in the world.
