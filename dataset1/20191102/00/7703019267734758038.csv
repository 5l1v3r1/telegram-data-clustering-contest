World Vegan Day: How going vegan could boost your health

02 Nov 2019, 00:30

NEW YORK, Nov 2 ― With November 1 marking World Vegan Day, and the start of World Vegan Month, we round up some recent studies which suggest that switching to a vegan diet could bring big health benefits.

Keep diabetes in check

A study published late last year found that patients with type 2 diabetes might be able to control the condition by following a plant-based diet or vegan diet. After looking at 433 diabetes sufferers, the researchers found that following a predominantly plant-based diet rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, and seeds with few animal products, or none at all (a vegan diet) could effectively reduce the risks associated with type 2 diabetes, boost weight loss and improve mental and cardiovascular health. Patients following a plant-based diet were also able to stop taking medical treatments or reduce their dosage.

Boost good gut microbes

A small-scale US study published earlier this year suggests that a vegan diet could boost levels of the microbes in our gut which are related to improvements in body weight, body composition and blood sugar control. The study looked at 147 overweight participants and asked them to follow either their usual diet or a low-fat vegan diet for 16 weeks. The findings showed that the group that followed a vegan diet lost an average of 5.8kg, and showed a significant increase in insulin sensitivity. The number of beneficial gut bacteria also increased in the vegan group, and the changes were associated with decreases in body weight, fat mass and visceral fat.

Feel fuller for longer

A recent study found that following a vegan diet could increase satiety, which is the feeling of being full and satisfied after a meal. The small study looked at 60 male participants, including 20 with obesity, 20 with type 2 diabetes, and 20 who were healthy. It found that the men who ate a vegan meal with tofu showed an increase in beneficial gastrointestinal hormones involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism, insulin secretion, satiety and weight management after the meal, compared to after eating a non-vegan meal with meat and cheese. In addition, all men reported increased satiety after the vegan meal.

Improve heart health

Eating a plant-based diet could help boost heart health, according to a study published this year in the Journal of the American Heart Association. Studying over 10,000 US adults, researchers found that people who ate the most plant-based foods overall had a lower risk of having a cardiovascular disease such as heart attacks, stroke, heart failure and other conditions, a lower risk of dying from a cardiovascular disease and a 25 per cent lower risk of dying from any cause, compared to those who ate the least amount of plant-based foods. Previous studies which have looked at more specific populations, such as such as vegetarians or Seventh Day Adventists who eat a mostly vegan diet also showed similar results. ― AFP-Relaxnews

The stocks, the fiscal deficit, the debt and public sector reforms, the challenges of the next government
When you want to mitigate the effects without working on the causes, what the economic system does is return a slap working much worse. What it does is deteriorate more and more economic and social conditions.

Analysis
By Javier Milei (*)
The recently expanded exchange rate means a cut in individual freedoms so that politicians' jets can cheat us with a higher dose of inflation tax. It is fatally arrogant to believe that a price can be set by finger. The prices in the economy are not determined by the dollar, the price transfer is a theoretical fallacy. The price level is given by the amount of money.
The dollar being a financial asset, first rises to an excess supply of money due to a fall in demand. The stocks have as a counterpart a parallel dollar that shows the excess demand for foreign exchange and therefore an excess supply in the rest of the economy.
The excess supply of bonds causes their prices to fall and the interest rate to rise. The interest rate being above that of natural equilibrium leads to a fall in investment and an increase in savings resulting in an excess supply of goods that causes the level of economic activity to fall. With less economic activity, less demand for work,
The excess supply of work pushes down the real wage and generates unemployment. The combination of lower real wages and unemployment raises the number of poor and destitute by heating the social climate and generating pressure for greater public spending. The largest fiscal deficit and without any financing leads to the issuance of money (in Argentina it is a sin to touch spending). This feeds a greater excess of supply that drives new price rises and sharpens the exchange imbalance. Nothing good is yet to come.
These measures and their subsequent effects are intensifying the dynamics of the crisis itself. When you want to mitigate the effects without working on the causes, what the economic system does is return a slap working much worse. What it does is deteriorate more and more economic and social conditions.
The deficit
I think the main point is that the mother of the sheep is the fiscal deficit and the size of the State. Not only do we have an overwhelmingly large state, but it also has a deficit. This, with my colleague Diego Giacomini we studied and what we proposed is basically a reform of the State, that in a period of 4 years the consolidated public expenditure in relation to provinces and municipalities can be reduced by 15 points, so that they can lower the fiscal pressure by 10 points and free resources on the supply of the economy to start growing again.
In addition, lower employers' work charges, eliminate the tax on reinvested earnings, allow adjustment for balance sheet inflation, eliminate personal assets, minimum presumed income, also correct the gross income situation, all that set of measures that must be Take so that the economy can grow. So that it makes sense to invest, as companies begin to earn money, they invest and generate employment.
In this context that generates employment, a reform in the public sector can be applied to implement a program of voluntary retreats because during the last Kirchner period, 1,400,000 public employees were added who, basically, what they were doing was hiding the real unemployment.
In this way, if the economy begins to grow, labor becomes relatively cheaper, what will be achieved is that there is much more demand for labor and unemployment can be lowered and public employment reduced. But, in addition, voluntary retirement programs have the characteristic that the person who retires goes to work elsewhere and, in addition, compensation is taken, which is a strong incentive when the economy is underway.
Dollarization
and debt
On the monetary level, we consider with the economist Diego Giacomini, that the economy has no currency, therefore it should be sincere the currency of the Argentineans that is the dollar and advance in a financial reform to go to an anti-run system, for later Go to a dollarization. Although we propose the competition of currency, strictly speaking, we believe that the currency that the Argentines have already chosen is the dollar, with which, we believe that technically in fact, the economy will end up operating with dollars.
On the other hand, in Argentina, what you have to understand in the debt issue is that the country is on its way to a default. Days ago, Finance Minister Hernán Lacunza when he said that Argentina had a problem of liquidity and not solvency, he lied. First, because the relationship between debt and product, (GDP) is not 70% as Lacunza said. It is higher, around 90 or 100% of GDP.
The second point is that it is also not true that it is a manageable or comfortable level of debt because emerging countries do not lend more than 55%.
Finally and much more serious, it is false because even when the debt / GDP ratio was 70%, and someone is supposed to finance it, which is a lie because for some reason Argentina has no financing and has more than 2000 country risk In addition to 14,000 country risk points at the short end of its debt securities as in the 2020 Bonar, in reality, what Argentina has to be able to repay its debt, needs to have a primary surplus under certain assumptions that do not exist.
For example, if you manage to borrow at 8% in dollars, which is false because you already have an average country risk above 2000 points and if you could systematically grow to 3% something that is false because you have not achieved it for 8 years , if under those two assumptions that Argentina does not reach them either by chance or in the most remote way, it would also have to have a primary surplus of 3.5 points of the GDP, when Argentina has a negative structural of 1.5 points of the GDP and with this fall in economic activity, it could be 2.5 negative points of GDP, so Argentina is going to have to make an adjustment more or less than 6 points of GDP and nobody talks about making a GDP adjustment.
In addition, you can no longer collect taxes, which, obviously, if we do not go to a state reform, this is not feasible. So, Argentina is not solvent, that's why the country risk is 2000, that's why the short risk is 14,000, but nobody talks about touching public spending. Because politicians live on public spending. Because they are willing to sink us into the worst miseries in order not to cut their privileges.
There is a report by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) on the technical inefficiency of public spending. The worst region in the world is Latin America with 4% of GDP, Argentina has 7.2% of the GDP of technical inefficiency and has an item called “leaks” of which Argentina has about 5 points of GDP. Argentina has both theft and technical inefficiency in the region. It is a scandal. Our politicians are the worst in the world. They are impoverishing us to enrich themselves. l
