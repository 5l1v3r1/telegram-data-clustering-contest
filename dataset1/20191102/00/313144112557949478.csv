[Sports Chosun Lee Won-man] It is expected to see the artistic shot of Stephen Curry (31, Golden State Warriors), the best shooter in the US. Palm fractures require colonization for at least 3 months. Curry's team, Golden State, announced that Curry had a palm surgery by Steve Shin at a hospital in Los Angeles. As a result, Curry seems to have to focus on recovery for at least three months. The Warriors' club says it will update Curry's status three months later. Curry suffered a left hand fracture in a home game against Phoenix Suns on October 31. The examination revealed that the second bone in the palm of the hand (the metacarpal bone) was broken, and the operation was performed immediately. The injury itself is not so fatal. Palm bones stick well and do not have great sequelae. But rehabilitation is important. Considering Curry's style of play with a sensitive shooting sensation, it seems to be a matter of how clear the awkwardness of the palm in the rehabilitation process. Golden State was injured early in the season. In addition to Curry, Kevin Rooney, Jacob Evans and Clay Tamson are on the list of wounded. As a result, he was sluggish at 1-3 in the early season.
