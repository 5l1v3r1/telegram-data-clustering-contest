Overwatch Players Will Have Access To All Of The Sequel's PvP Multiplayer Content
""nothing gets left behind""
02 Nov 2019, 00:30 by Liam Doolan



Overwatch 2 has just been confirmed for the Switch and multiple other platforms. So, is the original player base expected to migrate across to the sequel? According to the lead designer Jeff Kaplan, ""nothing gets left behind"" – or in this case, no hero gets left behind.
You see, both games will be part of a shared multiplayer environment. It means the heroes, maps and all of the player verse player game modes featured in the second game will be playable in the original Overwatch game.
Blizzard's PlayOverwatch website further clarifies this:
Current Overwatch players will battle side-by-side with Overwatch 2 players in PvP multiplayer; they’ll also be able to play Overwatch 2 heroes and maps.
This shared multiplayer also means existing players' accomplishments and loot collections will be carried across to the sequel.
It's great news for Switch fans, considering the original Overwatch game only arrived on the hybrid system last month. Of course, if you decide to stick with the first game, you won't have access to the sequel's PvE content.

Coach Inoue, aim for a global home run! Directed Japanese cannon candidates in Yokawa, Nakaya, and Egoshi right

02 Nov 2019

""Hanshin Autumn Camp"" (Aki, 1st)
Come out! The right Japanese cannon. Hanshin Kazuki Inoue hitting coach (48) issued a “global home run directive” to Yokawa, Nakatani, Egoshi, etc. by free hitting on the 1st. The practice was stopped at the ground and the emergency lecture was held for about 20 minutes. The 12-team worst 538 goals and home run hits are 94th in the league 5th place, and in order to solve the lack of scoring power, we will draw out the potential of Japanese cannon candidates who are stagnant.
打 The practice of hitting practice on the main ground has stopped. Inoue hitting coach called three right batters from Yokawa, Nakatani, and Egoshi. “Emergency lecture” was held during the tee shot.
I wanted to tell you that three people are batters with long hitting power. “You guys can hit the big (home run). Let ’s stop together the parts that we do n’t understand.”
ゴ Goro hits were conspicuous in the last free hit. Why can't I hit a home run? Coach Inoue tells his thoughts straight, and the three players sometimes nod deeply as if they were satisfied. The class took about 20 minutes.
¡The thing that I reported as an attitude to tackling batting practice was to aim for a home run instead of Goro. The effect was immediately demonstrated. The second set of free hits. The crossing of the Yokawa fence increased from 5 to 10 and Nakaya also tripled from 3 to 9. “I want to do what I have to do. I want to increase that probability because I am a long hit,” he says.
】 One of the missions imposed on the coach is to train the long-range gun on the right. ""My job is to raise everyone's numbers and make them work harder. One of them is to have someone grow up. As a team, I really want the right Japanese cannon."" With great effort. The idea is the same not only for 3 players but also for Oyama, who was the 4th in the team this season.
“I was getting better in the midst of what I would like to do with Keisuke,” after one hour in the special hit after the entire practice, Oyama was extended for 10 minutes. At the end, the direction toward long hitter training has been seen, such as tightening over the fence.
