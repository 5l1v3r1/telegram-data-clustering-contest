巨人・石井琢朗コーチ　走塁の意識改革を求める「２つ先の塁を狙うぐらいの走塁を」

02 Nov 2019

　巨人の石井琢朗野手総合コーチ（４９）が２日、川崎市のジャイアンツ球場で行われた秋季練習で、走塁への意識改革を掲げた。
　現役時代には２度の最多安打、４度のゴールデングラブ賞、盗塁王にも４度輝いた走攻守のスペシャリスト。勝つために、特に重視するのが走塁への意識だ。「隙あらば全員が走る姿勢。１つ先の塁っていうのは誰もが言うこと。２つ先の塁を狙うぐらいの走塁をしていかないと。確認作業も含めながら口酸っぱく言っていこうと思う」と宣言した。
　豊富な指導歴を誇るが、巨人ではスタートを切ったばかり。「なじんではいないけど、なじませようとはしている」と笑顔を見せる。「お互いの意思疎通をしっかりしていかないといけないと思う」。この日の練習中は、積極的に若手とのコミュニケーションを図りながら、身ぶり手ぶりで指導を行った。

Accused of murder: Mamadou Camara sentenced to 5 years imprisonment
02 Nov 2019 by bamada.net


The first case of the 1st day (Monday, October 28, 2019) of the 2nd Ordinary Session of the Assize Court sitting in Bamako was a case of murder that had Mamadou Camara appear as an accused. Thanks to the pleadings of his lawyers, Mr. Youssouf B. Keita and Mr. Abdrahamane Kanouté who proved that their client was in self-defense, Mamadou Camara escaped with 5 years of imprisonment.





Accused of the murder of Ousmane Diallo (41 years old), Mamadou Camara (18 years old) explained the circumstances of this death. According to him, on September 19, 2017, in front of the video game shop of his younger brother, he was addressed by Ousmane Diallo (saoûl) who asked him to return his belongings which he had been stripped in the street. ""When I was squatting to close the door of the game shop, Ousmane Diallo came with a piece of bottle to attack me. He had grabbed me. It is by releasing me and withdrawing the bottle that he was ""traced"" to the throat by the piece of bottle he held. When he fell, I was scared and fled back home. That's after the police came to arrest me, ""he told the bar.
At the request of the judge if he had informed his parents of the incident and if he knew Ousmane Diallo, he will answer by denial. And an assessor to ask Mamadou Camara: ""If Ousmane Diallo does not know you, why did he come to attack you in a crowd?"" The accused is speechless. The judge asks if the accused did not hurt Ousmane by another object because the murder weapon was not found. Mamadou Camara will keep his version of the facts. And another assessor to ask if Ousmane Diallo was not stung or cut at the neck instead of being traced because he was badly injured and lost a lot of blood before dying. The accused will not answer the question.
In turn, the Advocate General will ask to show the photo of the corpse of Ousmane Diallo. The lawyers of Mamadou Camara opposed this request because, according to them, this photo without signature or stamp can not constitute an exhibit. For the Advocate General, the act of Mamadou Camara is a murder.
In their pleading, Mamadou Camara's lawyers fought like beautiful devils to save the skin of their client. They emphasized the sloppy handling of the file since the preliminary investigations and throughout the hearing process. The police could not gather evidence, according to them and they add that it is the police who had to make the photos, but these photos were put at its disposal. There was no autopsy report of Ousmane Diallo's body. And their client can not be judged with the photos. They will say that Mamadou Camara is not a murderer because it is a blow that has resulted in consequences. And this shot was not intentional. The coup was not given with the intention of killing, argue the lawyers. For them, Mamadou Camara only defended himself, saving his life in the face of aggression. ""It is in the movements that Ousmane Diallo was injured. He was not slaughtered. Mamadou Camara was in self-defense. And his file was badly put together, ""they say. They pleaded for self-defense and demanded the acquittal of their client.
The Advocate General will assert that the blow was intentionally given without the intention of killing, contrary to the lawyers who maintained that the blow was involuntary. He will ask for the appropriate punishment, sufficiently severe. Lawyers will seek extenuating circumstances and a conditional minimum sentence. This heartwarming of lawyers was heard by the court.
After hearing the accused, the Attorney General, the lawyers, the Court found Mamadou Camara guilty, but with extenuating circumstances. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. The President of the Court informed the parents from Ousmane Diallo that they can seek compensation with damages.
