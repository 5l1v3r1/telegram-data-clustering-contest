트럼프, 미중 1단계 무역합의 체결 ""아이오와에서 할수도""
""협상 잘 되고 있다""…美대두 집산지 아이오와는 '팜벨트' 표밭
02 Nov 2019, 00:15 by 연합뉴스
입력 2019.11.02 09:15 도널드 트럼프 미국 대통령은 1일(현지시간) 중국과 추진 중인 무역협상 '1단계 합의' 체결과 관련, 서명을 위한 시진핑 중국 국가주석과의 회담 장소로 몇 곳을 검토 중이며 여기에 아이오와주도 포함된다고 말했다.AP와 AFP 통신에 따르면 트럼프 대통령은 이날 선거 유세를 위해 미시시피주로 떠나기에 앞서 백악관에서 기자들과 만나 ""다른 몇 장소를 보고 있다""면서 ""아이오와에서 있을 수도 있다""고 말했다.트럼프 대통령은 논의 상황과 관련, ""협상은 진행 중""이라며 ""중국과의 우리의 합의는 잘 되어가고 있다""고 말했다. 다만 그는 협정이 마무리될 때까지 더 많은 세부사항을 말하고 싶지 않다고 거듭 말했다고 AFP는 전했다.양국이 지난달 10~11일 워싱턴DC에서 가진 제13차 고위급 무역협상 직후 트럼프 대통령은 ""매우 실질적인 1단계 합의에 도달했다""고 밝힌 바 있다.미중은 당초 이달 16~17일 칠레에서 열릴 예정이던 아시아태평양경제협력체(APEC) 정상회의를 계기로 양 정상 간에 1단계 합의 공식 서명을 추진해왔다. 그러나 칠레가 국내 시위를 이유로 APEC 정상회의 개최를 전격 취소해 합의 장소가 관심의 대상이 됐다.이와 관련, 윌버 로스 상무장관은 이날 폭스 비즈니스 네트워크와 인터뷰에서 1단계 합의에 대해 ""좋은 상태""라며 이달 중순께 서명될 것으로 보인다고 말했다.한편 트럼프 대통령이 거론한 아이오와주는 미국 내 최대의 대두 집산지로, 무역협상의 민감한 영향을 받는 지역이다. 중국이 세계 1위의 콩 수입 국가여서다.  앞서 1단계 합의의 일환으로 미국은 당초 지난달 15일부터 예정했던 2천500억 달러 규모의 중국 제품에 관세율 인상(기존 25%→30%)을 보류했다.  중국은 대량의 미국산 농산물 구매를 약속한 것으로 전해졌으며, 미측 주장에 따르면 그 규모가 400억~500억달러(약 47조4천억~59조3천억원)에 이르는 것으로 알려졌다.  또한 아이오와는 내년 재선 도전을 앞둔 트럼프 대통령 입장에서는 러스트 벨트(쇠락한 공업지대)와 함께 중요한 팜벨트(중서부 농업지대) 표밭이기도 하다.  트럼프는 지난 2016년 대선에서도 아이오와에서 당시 힐러리 클린턴 민주당 후보를 눌렀다.각 당의 대선 후보를 뽑는 코커스(당원대회)와 프라이머리(예비선거) 가운데 전국에서 첫 코커스가 내년 2월 3일 아이오와에서 열린다. 아이오와 코커스에서 이기면 초반 '승기'를 잡는다는 인식이 퍼져있다. 좋아요 0 Copyrights ⓒ 연합뉴스. 무단 전재 및 재배포금지

The 9 best own series that HBO has left us so far in 2019
02 Nov 2019 by Diario Tecnología
This year, the North American chain has pleasantly surprised us with some high quality series. Although it is less prolific than Netflix and its catalog has fewer original contents, the possibility of enjoying some of these jewels, as well as past titles, justify the payment of the subscription to this service.
When preparing this list we have chosen only the series that have premiered their first season in 2019. Therefore, we have ruled out the releases of new seasons of great series, such as the final season of Game of Thrones (despite the controversy which has aroused and left millions of fans unhappy), the second season of Killing Eve or the third season of True Detective, among others.
Among the best original HBO series of 2019 we would like to highlight Chernobyl, which we consider to be one of the best we have been able to see throughout this year; Euphoria, which we also consider to be a great title thanks to its realism and its narrative style; or Years and Years, which offers us a vision of how the world could be in the next 15 years from a somewhat pessimistic perspective.

Chernobyl



Without a doubt, the big surprise of this 2019 in terms of series has been Chernobyl. It is not just one of the best original HBO titles, but it is one of the best series of this year.

The series analyzes everything that happened in the fateful dawn of April 26, 1986 and shows us what were the circumstances that led to the greatest nuclear disaster in history, as well as the great sacrifice made by firefighters, miners and other volunteers to try prevent the extent of the accident was much greater.

Euphoria



We continue with our list of best HBO series in 2019 with Euphoria.
The show sparked controversy among conservative US sectors to show more explicit scenes than desired, and before its release two scenes were censored. In addition, there are other moments that shocked a sector of spectators in the United States, such as the appearance on screen of an erect penis, although it was a prosthesis.
In spite of the controversy provoked, although the series presents hard moments and is not recommended for children under 18, it is not a show that uses sex or violence without meaning, and everything that shows has the objective of doing that both the plot and the characters are as realistic as possible.
