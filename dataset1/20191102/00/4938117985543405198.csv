Hybrid car as the most economical
02 Nov 2019 by Sergey Ivanov

Recently, more and more attention among potential buyers deserves not only comfortable and cheap cars, but also economical ones. The constant increase in fuel prices and environmental transport trends make us think about buying a hybrid car.






First of all, this is a big fuel savings. Secondly, toughened requirements for environmental friendliness of transport in many countries simply force drivers to change their car to an electric car or a hybrid one.
Hybrid cars combine a conventional internal combustion engine and an electric motor. In urban traffic mode, the electric motor power unit is used. And on the highway, at high speeds, a powerful ICE powered by fuel is turned on.

The advantages of a hybrid car are not only real fuel savings when driving on an electric motor, but also its almost silent operation. The advantages of this type of machine include a rechargeable electric motor. Its battery is charged by the internal combustion engine.
As in any car, hybrids also have disadvantages, which include expensive maintenance and the inability to repair them on their own.
In the Russian market, the demand for hybrids is declining due to the lack of specialized gas stations, service centers and qualified craftsmen. In addition, high prices for hybrid cars categorically do not want to fall.
However, the domestic auto industry is doing its best to keep up with global trends and is creating cars with a mixed type of engine.
E-mobile is one of the first models of domestic electric hybrid. The first E-Mobile was launched in 2010. Its cost varies from 360 to 45 thousand rubles. Manufacturers, abandoning the internal combustion engine, installed two electric motors on each axis.
Good handling and an interesting concept will not overshadow the significant engine flaws and lack of mass production.
The ё-crossover, released in 2011, has a spacious interior and excellent dynamics. It is equipped with two types of engines: ICE and electric. Among the shortcomings of the E-crossover, many shortcomings have been noticed that manufacturers will have to fix. Nevertheless, the popularity of this hybrid in Russia is only growing every year. This is due to its attractive price, which amounts to 460 thousand rubles.
Japanese hybrid cars are in high demand among Russians than domestic ones. This is due to the fact that the price / quality ratio for Asian hybrids meets the requirements of our drivers.
The most popular Japanese models over the past 2 years have become the Toyota Prius Hybrid, Toyota Prius Prime, Toyota Camry Hybrid, Honda Insight and Infiniti QX60. The pricing policy for these models ranges from 1 million to 1.9 million rubles.
Japanese hybrids have a stylish design, a spacious interior, excellent dynamics and powerful engines. The disadvantages include the high cost of components and the complexity of the repair.
German cars with a hybrid engine are known throughout the world for their reliability, comfort and high level of safety. High-quality assembly, powerful engines and first-class components distinguish the Germans from all other manufacturers of hybrids. The incredible efficiency of German engines is amazing. For 100 km, from 1.7 to 2.5 liters of fuel are consumed.
However, many German-made models are not represented at all in the Russian market. And in order to get a reliable German hybrid, you will have to pay a tidy sum for transportation and customs duties.
Total. Modern hybrid cars on the world market are presented in a wide assortment for every taste: minivans, sports cars, SUVs, hatchbacks and crossovers. The high price quickly pays off with low fuel consumption. Despite all the pros and cons of this type of machine, demand, both on the Russian and the world market, is constantly growing. This forces manufacturers of hybrid machines to continuously expand the range and withimprove existing models.
