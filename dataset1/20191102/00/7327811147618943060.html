      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- About 1,000 people protesting what they say is New York police brutality marched through downtown Brooklyn, chanting "no justice, no peace!"</p>
      <p>The peaceful protesters filled main avenues Friday evening as they passed the Barclays Center arena where the Brooklyn Nets play. The march came several days after <a href="https://abc7ny.com/critics-take-aim-at-nypd-over-2-incidents-at-subway-stations/5654256/">a video emerged on social meida </a>showing police officers fighting with teenagers inside city subway stations.</p>
      <p>Marchers say they oppose what they consider over-policing of the subway system.</p>
      <p>The protest comes after a period in which the New York Police Department has been under scrutiny for several shootings of armed civilians.</p>
      <p>No arrests were reported on Friday.</p>
      <p>A 15-year-old punched by a police officer during the subway melee in Brooklyn is filing a notice for a lawsuit against the officer and the NYPD.</p>
      <p>Officers trying to break up the fight punched Benjamin Marshall in the face.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday the teenager and his parents gathered at the law office of attorney Sanford Rubenstein to announce the filing of a $5 million notice of claim against the city.</p>
      <p>Police brass placed the officer, assigned to the 84th Precinct, on non-enforcement duty as the investigation continues.<br/><i><br/>(The Associated Press contributed to this report.)</i></p>
