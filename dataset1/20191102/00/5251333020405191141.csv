This Eyeball-Looking Thing Is One of The Biggest Single-Celled Organisms
02 Nov 2019 by JACINTA BOWLER
Throughout the world's oceans, hidden in coral rubble, you can find strange blobs of various sizes. Named sailor's eyeballs (Valonia ventricose) these squishy balls are actually an incredibly cool type of algae – they're one of the largest unicellular organisms in the world.
Indeed, that whole ball is a single cell. Now, that's not the size we'd usually associate with unicellular organisms, but sailor's eyeballs have some neat tricks up their sleeve to help them grow that big.
To start with, we need to fess up - not all of these organisms are quite as large as the one in the picture above. They can range in size from as small as a ball bearing, all the way up to their namesake, the eyeball.

High-school biology classes may have informed you that cells simply can't grow that big, as there's diffusion to worry about - making something too large will mess up the surface-area-to-volume ratio.
But, although sailor's eyeballs are one cell, they contain several cytoplasmic domains, each with their own nucleus and chloroplasts.

This peculiar structure means that if you tried to pop it, it wouldn't just go bust like a balloon full of organelles. In fact, squashing one sailor's eyeball can cause more of them to spring up, since the organisms only need to possess one nucleus to grow into an entirely new eyeball.
So, there's your cool fact for the day. Although these strange beady things with their myriad nuclei can cause problems for aquarium enthusiasts, in nature they'll happily live out their sea-faring life wowing divers and scientists alike.

Alien vs. retro-analysis Predator, a beat 'em up of Capcom full of xenomorphs and for which the years do not seem to have passed
02 Nov 2019 by Diario Tecnología
One of the greatest attractions of Capcom Home Arcade is to see, for the first time in a home system, the recreational Alien vs.. Predator of 1994. A beat 'em up in the line of the classics of the time of Capcom, an expert in the genre thanks to titles such as Final Fight or The Punisher.
Having been for so many years exclusive to arcade halls, I had not played it for a long time and that's why I wanted to remember it, not only as a fan of the genre ""I against the neighborhood"", but also the figures of Alien and Predator. But how is the classic preserved?



In Extra Life, what did we play in 1987? These are the 21 best classic video games of that year
Aliens, humans, predators and vice versa



It is worth noting, first of all, that that same year (1994) two games were released under the same name (Alien vs. Predator): on the one hand this beat 'em up for recreational by Capcom, and on the other , an SPF for Atari Jaguar developed by the Rebellion study that was well received.
In the case of the Japanese work, it was very interesting to see how we could choose between two humans (or cyborgs with human appearance, rather) and two predators to cope with intense waves of aliens over seven phases. It was a beat 'em up that squeezed the capacity of the CPS-2 board by putting on the screen a lot of xenomorphs, something beastly for the time.
Among the predators there were hardly any differences, having in common how well balanced they were in terms of strength, speed and ability. On the part of Schaefer and Kurosawa there was a radical change, especially on the part of the fort, of extremely slow movements and without jumping; Linn Kurosawa was fast and had a very useful air combo.
Alien vs. Predator, like The Punisher, was a beat 'em up that attached great importance to melee and firearms. Because the four protagonists had a weapon that they could use at any time, having to reload it at all times. The good thing is that the ammunition was infinite and from time to time a power-up appeared that allowed us to give it uninterrupted use for ten seconds without having to recharge.

Alien vs. Predator, a recreational classic



The story was the least of this arcade, although it was very interesting to know how predators helped humans by simply seeing part of the Earth invaded by these xenomorphs of space.
Logically, as we went through the phases, part of the cake was discovered, but what mattered was to drop lead and slap us with those deadly beings. And if it was in the company of colleagues, the better. Because Alien vs. Predator had a quality brand of the house.
He had some ""but"", of course, like not having weight differences in his squad of enemies (and that not all were standard aliens), or that third phase of filling in vehicle that we still do not explain for its extremely short duration and without sense. And, why not say it, how strange it was not to bet on a way for four players (having four protagonists, it was his thing) and that a homemade version materialized. In fact, if the SEGA Mega Drive 32X had not failed, another rooster would sing, because it was announced at the time, in 1995, a conversion for her.
Although he did not have the faces of the actors and actresses of the main films of Alien and Predator, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sigourney Weaver, he did respect both universes in general, being an ideal product for fans and with greater success than Robocop vs . Terminator
Have you endured time well?
Yes, like almost any beat 'em up of Capcom. Follow being the most consistent and a recommended diversion for those dead hours, for the simple pleasure of massacring xenomorphs (and something else). Now it only remains to see if Capcom is encouraged to launch Alien vs.. Predator on consoles and PC.
