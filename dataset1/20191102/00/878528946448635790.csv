Masao Uno Mistakes by free jump, 8th place by 4 falls ... tears alone

02 Nov 2019

""Figure Skating French Cup"" (2nd, Grenoble)
The Pyeongchang Winter Olympics silver medalist Masama Uno (Toyota), who was late for 4th place in the short program the day before, was freed by boys. There were 4 falls, and a total of 215.84 points of 136.79 points. It ended in the place. Nathan Chen (USA) won 297.16 points.
The Olympic silver medalist is suffering. Uno falls down to the triple accelerator (three and a half turns), which should have a sense of stability, when the four-turn Sarko, four-turn flip and mistake continue. Not far from free personal best (197.36 points) and total personal best (289.12 points). Although the rules were revised, it became a reference record, but the free scoring was the lowest since 2015, the senior debut year.
Uno, who is absent from the coach this season, sat alone on Kiss and Cry, who saw the score, and shed tears.
