      <p>MIT researchers first showed off its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/4/4802586/mit-lab-builds-self-assembling-robot-cubes">self-assembling “M-Block” robot cubes</a> in 2013 — and this week, they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=139&amp;v=hI5UDKaWJOo">shared a video</a> of what they’re calling M-Blocks 2.0 (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/mits-self-propelled-block-robots-can-now-manage-basic-swarm-coordination/">via <i>TechCrunch</i></a>). Like the first version of the blocks, M-Blocks 2.0 move by generating momentum with an internal flywheel, and can climb on and around each other using magnets:</p>

      <p>But these new blocks also have a “barcode-like” system on each block face that they can “read” to do things like follow a specific path:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And they can also act with a hive mind to <i>find each other and cluster together:</i></p>

      <p>Though this might seem terrifying, there are more benevolent expectations for the blocks right now.<i> </i><a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/self-transforming-robot-blocks-jump-spin-flip-identify-each-other-1030"><i>MIT News</i></a> reports that the researchers envision them being used in industries like inspection, gaming, manufacturing, health care, and even disaster response. Here’s what <i>MIT News</i> says a disaster response scenario could look like:</p>
      <blockquote>Imagine a burning building where a staircase has disappeared. In the future, you can envision simply throwing M-Blocks on the ground, and watching them build out a temporary staircase for climbing up to the roof, or down to the basement to rescue victims.</blockquote>
      <p>This would be... kind of incredible? I really hope that these tiny little blocks will actually be able to do that someday.</p>
