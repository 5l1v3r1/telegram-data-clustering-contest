      <p>EUCHA, Okla. (AP) - A northeast Oklahoma husband and wife are charged with injecting a woman with methamphetamine two years ago and videotaping her as she asked for help, then died.</p>
      <p>Court records show 50-year-old Brian Edward Anderson and 42-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/allie-beth-anderson/">Allie Beth Anderson</a> were charged Tuesday with first-degree murder in the October 2017 death of 41-year-old Melissa Vermillion at the Anderson’s home in Eucha, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) east of Tulsa.</p>
      <p>Affidavits say an informant in August linked the two to Vermillion’s death and that she may have been killed to prevent her from testifying against the Anderson’s in a separate case. The document says the Andersons face drug charges in another county.</p>
