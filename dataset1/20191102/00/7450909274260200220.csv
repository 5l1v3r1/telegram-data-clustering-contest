Kicking off the main card was a main event between Angelo Trevino and Gilbert Urbina at a catch-weight of 175 pounds. Both men showed exceptional grappling ability, but Urbina was just a bit better each round in that department, taking a unanimous decision win with 30-27s across the board.In a women’s catch-weight fight, Abril Anguiano took on Paola Ramirez for three rounds. The bout was a back-and-forth dog fight, which Anguiano got the better of on the judges’ scorecards via split decision (28-29, 30-27, 30-27).On the final bout of the main card Hector Fajardo met Aaron Vickers in a bantamweight contest. Fajardo was clearly the better striker, battering Vickers on the feet and even dropping him at one point. Vickers stood a chance with his grappling, but it wasn’t enough to get the job done on the scorecards, as Fajardo won via unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27).On the prelims, Victor Reyna outclassed Nick Gay after three rounds of fighting at welterweight. Reyna was superior in all aspects, despite some decent work from top position by Gay in the third round. Reyna swept the score cards with 30-27s. Making his MMA debut in a featherweight contest, John Pham impressed by putting on a striking clinic. He bested wrestler Charles Spoolstra via unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27). It wasn’t the most exciting of fights, but it was a solid win for Melvin Lopez at flyweight, who dominated Aldair Romero with his wrestling for three rounds. He picked up a unanimous decision victory on the score cards. At lightweight, Ricky Romo met Paul Garza in a bout that went all three rounds. Garza looked to be superior on the feet early on, but Romero was able to use his grappling the last two rounds to ride out a decision victory on the score cards (29-28, 29-28, 30-27).
