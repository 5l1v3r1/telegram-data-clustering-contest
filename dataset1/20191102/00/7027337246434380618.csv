02 Nov 2019, 00:25 by Wes Fenlon
As a surprise addition to the reveal of Hearthstone's next expansion, Descent of Dragons, Blizzard announced an entirely new mode, launching in beta very soon. It's called Battlegrounds, and it's an eight-player showdown inspired by the autobattler genre that started earlier this year with Dota Auto Chess. Above is a full 10-minute match of Battlegrounds from Blizzard's press site.
The player's champion is Ragnaros the Firelord, and the footage takes us through how a typical Battlegrounds match will play out. Matches alternate between the tavern, where players recruit minions, and 1v1 battlefields against the other seven players in the match. Everyone starts with 40 health, and the last one standing wins.
Head over to our BlizzCon 2019 hub for more news from this year's convention, and check out our gallery of all the Hearthstone: Descent of Dragons cards so far.

A new revolution in the agricultural industry by the Iranian elite with crawler drones
02 Nov 2019 by Asr Iran
Seed dispersal, deforestation and crop spraying have long been a concern for dear farmers, with problems such as crop failure, crop failure and the loss of 10% of crops by workers and agricultural equipment. So the issue of smart farming has been raised around the world, and this is rapidly advancing globally. However, access to smart agriculture seemed impossible with sanctions against our beloved country. But why look abroad to fix this? Today, with the creativity of the Iranian elite at Sirang Company, this concern has been resolved, and we rely on this Iranian talent and confidence in their performance to be Iranian and to support our elite.
Hadi Sharifian is a scientific elite and a professor of agricultural mechanization. An elite that has revolutionized the traditional industry by innovating in the agricultural industry and designing and producing intelligent drones. This Iranian start-up seeks to streamline agriculture and make the most of technology in the industry, with the aim of optimizing the process of agricultural production and water consumption control with the goal of desertification by producing vertical drones. By using these drones, farmers do not have to sow or spray muddy land directly on difficult land, mud, or mud. Due to the accuracy and uniformity of the seed spraying and spraying process, one can expect a higher quality product.



Sirang Company, managed by Hadi Sharifian, is capable of covering one hectare of land within 7 minutes by producing perpendicular flying robots with the ability to spread poison, seed, solution, feed, fertilizer, etc. The drones have 5, 10, 15 and 20 liter tanks that will cover every 1,000 square meters. These drones also have high accuracy due to having two GPS connected to the satellites, which can be said to cover the crop without error and prevent environmental pollution. In addition to these, the vertical-type agricultural flightless birds are foldable, making them very easy to carry.
Equipping this UAV with radar for rough terrain, foothills, steep hills, steep slopes, etc. are easily covered, and the user simply has to select the fly button app to select actions such as spraying, pest control, Foliar application, hot sprinkler, precision surveying, spectroscopy, aquatic nutrition, pollination and so on with reduced water consumption.
The Sirang Company's beautiful look at youth employment through this industry is highly significant as it employs 5 expert personnel for each drone: pilot, pilot assistant, technical officer, flight supervisor and plant physician. The company is currently helping to create jobs for college graduates.
According to the studies conducted on the future of these Iranian drones, it is estimated that for 18 million hectares of our land needs 20 thousand UAVs, which capacity of each UAV covers 2500 hectares, which means a suitable and sustainable investment for the development of our beloved Iran. It can also play an important role in the international arena.
Farmers buy these drones with 4 to 15 percent facility, which is a good idea to buy as a replacement because investing in this industry can easily generate a sustainable monthly income of between $ 10 million and $ 20 million, depending on the drones. The size of the tank and their engine power range from 67 to more than 200 million USD.
Also, due to repeated requests from farmers who are not able to purchase these drones, hectares can also be provided, for example, they receive an average of 150,000 tomans per hectare for their services, depending on the number of hectares the applicants request. This price will either rise or fall. It is worth noting that in this way all the executing operations will be performed by the security personnel.



Given the youth of the Sirang Company and their field of activity, the youth of the industry decided to launch their services nationally by attending the Maidon television program. Fortunately, the project won the first place among the three proposals And reached the final stage. It is our social duty to proudly support our scientific elite and to give them the feeling that they are not alone in the competition and continue to do so by competing. To support this all-Iranian creativity, you only have the chance to go to this link and give Hadi Sharifian a five-star rating and pave the way for success for our elite.
