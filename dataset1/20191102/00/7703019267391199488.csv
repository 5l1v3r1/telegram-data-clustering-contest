Αποσύρθηκε από την διεκδίκηση του χρίσματος των Δημοκρατικών για τον Λευκό Οίκο ο Μπέτο Ο'Ρουρκ

02 Nov 2019, 00:50

Ο Δημοκρατικός υποψήφιος για το χρίσμα του κόμματός του για την αμερικανική προεδρία Μπέτο Ο’Ρουρκ ανακοίνωσε σήμερα ότι αποσύρεται από την κούρσα διεκδίκησης, τονίζοντας πως δεν έχει κατορθώσει να συγκεντρώσει την αναγκαία χρηματοδότηση για να συνεχίσει την εκστρατεία του.
«Οι υπηρεσίες μου προς την χώρα δεν θα είναι ως υποψήφιος, ούτε ως διεκδικητής. Το να το παραδεχθώ τώρα είναι προς το καλλίτερο συμφέρον όσων συμμετέχουν στην εκστρατεία μου. Είναι προς το καλλίτερο συμφέρον του κόμματος στην προσπάθειά μας να ενωθούμε γύρω από έναν διεκδικητή της προεδρίας. Και είναι προς το καλλίτερο συμφέρον της χώρας», τόνισε ο Ο’Ρουρκ σε μήνυμά του στο Twitter.
Ο 47χρονος Ο’Ρουρκ, που είχε γίνει ιδιαίτερα δημοφιλής στη χώρα καθώς παρ’ ολίγον να εκλεγεί Γερουσιαστής στο Τέξας το 2018, προσπάθησε να διεκδικήσει το χρίσμα του Δημοκρατικού Κόμματος. Ωστόσο, τα χαμηλά ποσοστά δημοφιλίας του και η έλλειψη ικανής χρηματοδότησης, τον ανάγκασαν να αποσυρθεί. Με την αποχώρησή του Ο’Ρουρκ παραμένουν πλέον 17 υποψήφιοι στην κούρσα της διεκδίκησης για το χρίσμα των Δημοκρατικών.
Ο ίδιος πρόσθεσε πως θα διεκδικήσει ξανά την εκλογή του στη Γερουσία του χρόνου, μία απόφαση που δεν πρόκειται να ευχαριστήσει αρκετά ηγετικά στελέχη του κόμματός του.

The Argentine post-election economy: restrictions, situation and structure
The future of our economy depends on the international context and the way in which structural and current problems are addressed internally.
02 Nov 2019 by Opinion
The Argentine economy currently has multiple problems: increases in poverty and indigence levels, high inflation, falling product, volatility in the exchange rate, restrictions on access to international credit, high levels of indebtedness, fiscal deficit, deficit Quasi fiscal and current account deficit, among others.
Orthodox economic visions (manifested, for example, by economists such as presidential candidate José Luis Espert) have a simple diagnosis: the cause of our problems is the ""lack"" of liberalism in the administration of the economy. Therefore, it would be necessary to reduce the size of the State to the minimum possible, privatize public companies and deregulate and liberalize ""markets."" In this sense, as recurring slogans appear the unrestricted opening of the economy, the flexibility of the labor market and the privatization of health and education.
This view, in the particular case of our country, is complemented by the argument that since liberalism was abandoned 75 years ago, Argentina began to gradually become involved until it ceased to belong to the select club of developed countries, which we supposedly started to integrate at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the X | X, when we were known worldwide as ""the granary of the world"".
However, any deep analysis, not tied to liberal dogmatism, shows that these discourses are false. Those who propose the recipes of the Washington Consensus for our economy, do so as if they had never been applied in our country, as if we had not at any time experienced the reduction of the size of the State, the flexibility of the labor market or irresponsible opening of the capital account.
In this sense, Argentina has been one of the countries where liberal economic policies have been most deeply implemented. The dictatorship that governed during the period 1976-1983 began with a process that deepened Menem in the 1990s (privatizing up to a strategic resource such as oil, an issue that was not even observed in Chile with copper), which generated recurring crises with increasingly strong impacts: debt crisis of 1982, hyperinflations of 1989-1990 and mega crisis of 2001. Thus, it is clearly seen how in the last 75 years liberalism had a continuous and intense prominence for at least a quarter of a century .
On the other hand, the Argentine decline did not begin in 1945 as indicated by orthodox discourse, but in the mid-1970s, as Pablo Gerchunoff and Lucas Llach show in their economic history book entitled “The cycle of illusion and disenchantment "":"" While in the postwar decades Argentina finally achieved significant growth, and if it lost positions against some countries, it gained them over others, verifying the comparative performance of the country from the mid-1970s onwards looks less like a economic history exercise than one of masochism ”(2010, p. 461). Thus, while between 1945 and 1975 the country's per capita income doubled, between 1975 and 2001 it remained practically stagnant.
This historical exercise of demystification of the duration and origin of the national decline is essential to understand our present and think about our future. Above all, because in recent years a new liberal economic wave has been present in Argentina with the promise of solving the macroeconomic problems that plagued the country. However, in these times we find that some of the previous problems have worsened, such as inflation; others have improved, such as the energy deficit or the trade deficit, but at the expense of dollarizing tariffs or reducing imports through a recession; and new problems have appeared such as the painful increase in poverty and destitution, the increase in public indebtedness (and in dollars), the lack of control of the exchange rate, the recession, the deindustrialization or the “ball” of Leliq of the Central Bank.
The future of our economy depends on the international context and the way in which structural and current problems are addressed internally. As for the former, the commercial conflict between China and the United States and the political turbulence in Latin America do not create a favorable environment for development. However, unforeseen events may arise in the world that modify international conditions in our favor. On the other hand, in relation to the latter, the new government must consider the restrictions it will encounter.
Restrictions
First, the maturity profile of capital and interest on public debt makes it impossible to meet obligations with creditors. According to data from the Ministry of Finance, considering only the private sector and the year 2020, 33 billion dollars are owed in capital and interest (that is, without adding the debt to the public sector and to bi and multilateral organizations).
Second, although the collapse of imports caused by the recession and the increase in the exchange rate has allowed us to reach a trade surplus, the lack of dollars remains a problem for the country. The increase in interest payment represents the main reason why the current account of the balance of payments has not been balanced, since we went from paying quarterly 1400 million dollars at the end of 2015 as interest, more than double at present (3700 million was the amount in the second quarter of this year).
Third, although the liberal discourse emphasizes the need for the State not to “live above its means” and, therefore, avoid the fiscal deficit, during the first years of the Cambiemos government, despite the strong reductions in energy subsidies, the fiscal deficit increased (as did the current account deficit). The main cause of this phenomenon is in the de-financing of the State, generated by the reduction of withholdings on exports of commodities, the almost elimination of the personal property tax, the reduction of employer contributions, among others. After the agreement with the International Monetary Fund, although the primary deficit (that is, the one that does not include interest payments) was reduced, the financial deficit (which does include it) remains at high levels, with a value accumulated until September greater than 2% of GDP, according to information published by the Ministry of Finance.
Therefore, in parallel to the development of policies that allow us to improve our structural and current conditions, the next government must deal with these restrictions. In this direction, one of the first measures to take is the restructuring of the public debt. There are different alternatives for this. Ideally, a full audit of the public debt and a census of creditors should be carried out, since the current indebtedness derives from that of the last military dictatorship. These actions would be important to have all the necessary information to negotiate in the best possible way the restructuring, it could even happen that part of the debt is illegal and does not correspond to pay it. Another possibility is that all the debt is considered legitimate and that changes in the contracts that are beneficial for Argentina but that do not attack the root problem are negotiated.
The dollar
Another decision that the new government must make is related to the exchange rate, with the dollar. Most likely, a high level of the exchange rate as the current one is the norm, since the next president has declared that it seems reasonable. This is in line with the economic model of the first Kirchner (2003-2007), based on a competitive exchange rate and twin surpluses. Then, the challenge with respect to the dollar will not be in the level but in the volatility. The centrality of this currency for the national economy, not only in economic terms, but also in social, political and even psychological terms, makes its monitoring fundamental. For this, a medium-term de-dollarization plan is necessary, such as that carried out by countries such as Brazil, with stories similar to ours in terms of inflation, crisis and defaults. It is an unknown if in the consensus that the next government intends to build this plan is a reality. What is most likely is the end of the policies that promoted dollarization these years, through financial deregulation.
Poverty
In addition, of the debt and the dollar, the next government must quickly deal with the increase in destitution and poverty in recent years. While structural poverty requires a multidimensional approach and structural policies, the urgency lies in addressing the increases in destitution. It is important to keep in mind that the poverty indicator published by INDEC shows the percentage of the population that does not have enough income to buy a basic basket that has food and non-food products, while homelessness only considers food goods. In other words, when the latter increases, a larger percentage of the population has problems feeding. According to the latest INDEC report, during the first half of this year 7.7% of the population is considered indigent, while in 2016 this number was 6.1% (in addition,living conditions have been getting worse since STEP). While the commitment of the next government is to eliminate hunger, the biggest challenge is whether it will be able and / or can reduce the country's structural poverty.
Inflation
A fourth macroeconomic problem to face is inflation, which has been accelerating in recent years, since of the 25% annual indexes of the first half of this decade, we move to values close to 50% in both 2018 and this year. The monetarist strategy, which increased the interest rate to values that strongly limit productive activity and reduced aggregate demand causing a strong recession, was not efficient. Taking into account the distributive bid as a central cause of inflation such as ours is central to carry out a successful anti-inflationary policy, imitating the examples of countries such as Colombia or Israel. A medium term agreement is essential for this. Among the plans of the next government, an agreement between workers and employers appears among the proposals. The capacity and possibility of generating broad medium and long agreements will be fundamental for anti-inflationary policy, in particular, and for all economic policy, in general.
These four short-term problems are only part of the Argentine economic puzzle. It is difficult to move towards structural objectives without considering these issues, perhaps priorities. The sustained growth, the creation of employment, the change in the productive matrix, complexing it and making it more intensive in the use of technology, the strategic integration to the world that allows to strengthen our economic capacities, the improvement of the population's standard of living broad, among other issues, will depend on how we solve these and other urgencies, but fundamentally that we carry out the structural reforms that we have been dodging decades ago. l
