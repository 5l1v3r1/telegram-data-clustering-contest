      <p>There is a plenty of Holiday romance on the way, but don’t sleep on Valentine’s Day! The trailer was released today for <i>The Photograph</i>, a movie in which <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/08/lakeith-stanfield-has-the-range.html">Lakeith Stanfield</a> plays, by all early indications, a wonderful man who is in love with <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/issa-rae-reportedly-developing-set-it-off-remake.html">Issa Rae</a>, and she has to decide if she’s willing to <i>be</i> loved. Rae’s character has just discovered a cache of letters from her deceased mother written to her that share previously unknown stories about her life and work as a photographer and thoughts on love (with a devastatingly handsome <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/07/the-first-purge-star-ylan-noel-on-beating-up-nazis.html">Y’lan Noel</a>). Stanfield’s character is writing a profile about Rae’s mom, but soon enough is enamored of her, and it’s all glowing skin and meaningful looks from there. Like we said, <i>The Photograph </i>comes out on Valentine’s Day.</p>
