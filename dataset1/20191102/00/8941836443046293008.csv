‘Borderlands 3’ Should Reconsider Not Making Any New Vault Hunters For DLC
02 Nov 2019 by Paul Tassi

The more I play Borderlands 3, the more I do believe that it has the kind of staying power that the first two games had, or that something like Destiny has now. I fully believe that like Borderlands 2, people will still be playing this, 4, 5, 7 years from now.With that said, I do hope Gearbox reconsiders a position they’ve taken, that they will not be making new vault hunters in upcoming DLC. This news came from director Paul Sage, as he explains that once people choose their vault hunter, they’re not that likely to pick up the new ones. And yet a lot of Borderlands superfans no doubt treasure their time with Krieg or Gaige and think BL2 was better off with their arrival.
I think I know what Borderlands 3 is trying to do here, and that’s channel Destiny in a way. Destiny has not added a fully new Guardian class past Hunter, Titan and Warlock since launch. What they have done, however, is introduce new skill trees, new “subclasses,” and I imagine that Borderlands is going to do something similar here.
The idea would be that in addition to the green, blue and orange trees we have now, they’d add say, a fourth tree in DLC with a new slate of skills for that Vault Hunter. That way, you’re not just getting more points to play around with, but you’re also getting a fully new tree to spec into with your already leveled hero if you want.

I can see the benefit of that. One problem with new vault hunters was being forced to do the whole story/1-50 leveling process all over again. A new skill tree could be accessible to all players from moment one.
But playing Borderlands 3 right now, it feels like Gearbox can barely manage three trees at once, much less four. Pretty much one of the trees feels pretty useless on each of the four vault hunters currently, with one of the three probably being the “correct” one for most players looking for the strongest builds. So far, Gearbox hasn’t really shown they can balance these out all that well, so I’m concerned simply adding even more complexity with another tree just wouldn’t produce the best results.
Also, part of me wants to do a brand new vault hunter with a totally unique style and do the whole leveling process again. There’s something a truly new vault hunter brings to the table that a new FL4K pet or new Moze mech attachments in a new tree simply won’t.
I understand that perhaps the data shows that it isn’t worth it to introduce new vault hunters, yet I think the game loses something by scrapping that concept. We can talk about Destiny, sure, but Diablo, WoW, pretty much all class-based RPGs add new classes in time, and that’s something I think new skill trees can’t match. And yes, it’s time for a damn fourth Guardian class already (Eliksni, anyone?), so I don’t think Destiny is even a great comparison point in this regard.
We will see if Gearbox changes their mind, as they seem open to this sort of feedback. I don’t think we would get a new vault hunter in time for the first DLC this year, even if they reverse course, but this game has a long road ahead of it, so never say never.

Getzlaf’s goal, Gibson’s 39 saves put Ducks past Canucks 2
02 Nov 2019 by GREG BEACHAM
ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) - Troy Terry circled his net with the puck and looked up at the two Vancouver Canucks between him and Ryan Getzlaf way down at the far blue line.
“My instinct was to pass to him, but I thought, ‘Is that the smartest thing?’” the rookie said. “So I just ripped it to him, and he’s Ryan Getzlaf, so of course he made a play.”
Terry’s long aerial pass eluded both Canucks and hit Getzlaf in the glove. The Ducks’ longtime captain settled the puck and sent Anaheim to another thrilling home win.
Getzlaf scored a breakaway goal 2:30 into overtime, and John Gibson made 39 saves in the Ducks’ 2-1 victory over Vancouver on Friday night.
In the 999th game of a career spent entirely with Anaheim, Getzlaf ended it with his seventh goal of the young season after that remarkable pass from Terry.


“Troy made a great play from behind the net,” Getzlaf said. “He showed great patience. Showed what he can do with the puck.”
While his passing acumen is well known, Getzlaf has one of the Ducks’ best shots when he deigns to use it - and he has used it lately, scoring in four consecutive games.
He only needed to tap in his winner, however: Markstrom charged out of his net in a desperate attempt to disrupt Getzlaf’s chance, but Getzlaf sidestepped the goalie and finished it.
“His first touch wasn’t the best, and I thought I had him beat,” Markstrom said. “And I didn’t. That’s the read I had. Obviously it’s easy to say now I should have stayed in (net), but I didn’t. Tough loss when we played such a good game.”

Both of these young clubs look like playoff contenders so far: The Ducks’ victory left Anaheim and Vancouver even on 18 points apiece in second place in the Pacific Division.
Jakob Silfverberg scored a short-handed goal in the first period for the Ducks, who improved to 6-1-0 at Honda Center this season with their second straight victory to open a seven-game homestand.
Adam Gaudette got credit for Vancouver’s tying goal with 6:18 to play when his apparent pass toward a driving Brandon Sutter deflected in off the skate of Anaheim defenseman Korbinian Holzer.
The goal came on the Canucks‘ 38th shot during a frustrating evening against Gibson, who came close to his 19th career shutout in a phenomenal performance. Vancouver also went scoreless on five power plays.
“I thought our team was pretty good tonight,” Vancouver coach Travis Green said. “I don’t know how many shots we had, but almost 70 attempts is pretty good. Their goalie played well. … The big thing is when you play a really good game, you want to get a point out of it. You’re going to play good some nights and lose. At least we got a point.”
Five-game point streaks ended for both Elias Pettersson and Bo Horvat, as did Brock Boeser’s three-game goal streak.
Markstrom stopped 27 shots for the Canucks, who have earned a point in six consecutive games. Vancouver lost for only the third time in 11 games, and fell to 0-3-1 when scoring fewer than three goals.
The Ducks scored during their second penalty kill when Rickard Rakell got the puck to Silfverberg alone in front of Markstrom, his teammate for several seasons at the start of their pro careers in Sweden. Silfverberg made a nifty deke and scored his seventh goal of the season on the forehand.
The goal also put Silfverberg at a plus-12, tying teammate Adam Henrique’s NHL-leading mark entering the evening.
Vancouver had a 32-11 shots advantage late in the second period, but couldn’t beat Gibson until the waning minutes of the third.
NOTES: Canucks D Quinn Hughes left in the first period with an apparent ankle injury, and Green provided no postgame update on his condition. The 20-year-old rookie had three assists Wednesday night at Los Angeles. … Silfverberg and Markstrom were teammates with Brynäs IF from 2006-11. … Holzer got the second assist on Silfverberg’s short-handed goal for his first point of the season. … Anaheim D Hampus Lindholm returned from a two-game absence with a lower-body injury.
