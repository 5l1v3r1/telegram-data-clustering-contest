Year of suffering for the great Spanish bank
Only three of the six major financial entities hold the value of their shares stable

02 Nov 2019, 00:03

A fall in profits of almost 10,500 million euros in one year. This is the 2019 balance for the six main Spanish banks that quote on the Ibex-25: Santander, BBVA, CaixaBank, Bankia, Sabadell and Bankinter. With the presentation of results for the third quarter of 2019, the six entities not only have earned less together, but that profit cuts have also resulted in a fall in their stock market value, since only three of the six Banks have been able to maintain the price of their shares stable since the beginning of the year.
The main explanation is the situation of the world economy and, above all, the very low interest rate policy applied by the European Central Bank, which greatly limits the profit margins of the entities when it comes to lending. ""The entire European financial sector is very affected by the negative interest rate situation we have since February 2016 and threatens to continue for some more years,"" explains Oriol Soley, professor of financial economics at the UAB. In this unfavorable situation for the entities, the clouds of recession that are approaching in countries such as Germany and the new reductions of types also in the United States, where they had so far remained higher, adds the clouds of recession, adds Soley.
CaixaBank
The cost of the ERO reduces the benefits
The main Catalan bank has reduced profits by 28% - a drop below expectations for analysts - for the provision of almost 1,000 million euros to face the costs of the employment regulation file (ERO) which is underway and will affect more than 2,000 employees. Without these costs, the company chaired by Jordi Gual would have increased its profit by 10% over the same period of 2018. With the ERO, CaixaBank expects to save 200 million euros annually.
The entity's difficulties have been noted in the parquets, since the entity's share has lost almost 20% of its value since the beginning of the year.
Sabadell
Strong increase in profits and revival of the British subsidiary
The good progress of TSB, the British subsidiary that has so many headaches has brought to Banco Sabadell in past years, is one of the factors that explain the 283% increase in the profit of the third quarter. In addition, the bank was able to reduce delinquency and increased the number of customers, while improving results in games such as commission and interest collections.
BBVA and Santander
Affected by Brexit, but with different results
The fact of having obtained extraordinary gains of 5,300 million in 2018 explains that BBVA has reduced profits the first nine months of the year. The entity has concentrated a large part of the profits in Mexico, one of its main markets. However, the second Spanish bank is affected by Brexit in the United Kingdom, where it has an important presence, like Santander Bank.





The banking entity chaired by Ana Patricia Botín, who also announced an ERO for 3,200 workers, reduced the profits by 35% in September 2018. The decrease in loans and business activity - the bank has many clients Corporate - explain the reduction of profits.
Bankia and Bankinter
The actions of the bank in the hands of the State continue to fall
Bankia is the only of the six Ibex-35 banks that have a majority of capital in the hands of the State, as a result of the rescue of 2012. The company's securities have lost almost a third of the value they had in January due to the 22% reduction in profits caused by lower earnings in fixed-income portfolios.
For its part, Bankinter was the bank with fewer benefits (444 million), but it was able to grow 10% thanks to its subsidiaries EVO Banco and Avantcard.

THE KEYS


1. What reasons do they explain that banks have a worse year than 2018?

The situation of bSpanish ancs is very similar to that of the majority of financial institutions in the countries of the euro zone: the monetary policy of the European Central Bank, which has been maintaining basic interest rates at 0% since 2016, activity These low interests mean that when they grant credit to their clients, European banks can not charge them very high interest rates and, therefore, they must maintain very limited profit margins in their loans.

2. There is talk of a new crisis. Will the Spanish bank affect if it finally arrives?

At the moment, in Spain most macroeconomic indicators and experts speak of a slowdown in the economy, with growth rates positive but inferior to the last years, which have been marked by a robust recovery of economic activity. On the other hand, there is talk of recession in countries in the center of the European Union, such as Germany, that if they enter into crisis they would negatively affect their business partners. These bad auguries of the European locomotive do not help economic activity - especially in industrial companies, which would be most affected by a German braking - and this always has repercussions on banks. Now, economists do not believe that if a new crisis comes, it has its origin in the financial system, as it happened in 2008, since it is much more regulated.

3. Does Brexit have effects on the results of the financial sector?

The uncertainty about how Brexit will end up has repercussions in the entire global financial industry, due to the great weight of the City of London as a global financial hub. In the case of Spanish banks, the two largest entities with the greatest presence in the United Kingdom have been negatively affected, but, on the other hand, Sabadell has taken advantage of the good performance of TSB, its British subsidiary, to inflate the profits .
