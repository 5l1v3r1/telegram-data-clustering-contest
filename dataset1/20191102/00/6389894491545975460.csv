Football: Lampard says Chelsea wary of wounded Watford

02 Nov 2019, 00:45

LONDON: Chelsea must guard against over-confidence when they take on winless bottom club Watford in the Premier League on Saturday, manager Frank Lampard said on Friday.
Though Chelsea bowed out of the League Cup with a 2-1 home defeat by Manchester United on Wednesday, they have won their last four matches in the Premier League and have climbed to fourth.

There is a real buzz around Stamford Bridge about Lampard's youthful side, but the club's record goalscorer knows that bad results can be just around the corner waiting to bite.
""On paper they are bottom of the league but they are wounded and a good team,"" Lampard, who will again be without N'Golo Kante, told reporters on Friday.
""The good thing about our winning run was how we dealt with different challenges. Watford will be another test for us. If you want to be top four you need to show consistency.
""With the winning run every game became more dangerous because of overconfidence. We know Watford's personnel is similar to last year and we can't underestimate a team that will be hurting. We'll be certainly even more focused.""
Chelsea face a big week with Ajax Amsterdam at home on Tuesday in the Champions League and then a London derby against Crystal Palace.
""We've had a good period but that could be lost in these next three games,"" Lampard warned.
Christian Pulisic scored a hat-trick for Chelsea last week in the 4-2 win at Burnley, but the young American is not guaranteed to start against Watford.
Michy Batshuayi scored a superb goal against United and Lampard also has youngster Callum Hudson-Odoi pushing for a regular starting place.
""There's competition for places. That's good. It keeps them on edge and means they have to perform to keep their place,"" Lampard said. ""I'm not here to rotate for the sake of it.""
As well as Kante, Chelsea are also without defender Antonio Rudiger on Saturday despite reports he was fit.
""He' not fit,"" Lampard said. ""I saw the quotes but there's a miscommunication somewhere and he's going to see a consultant on Monday because he has an ongoing issue in his pelvic area.
""We'll have to wait until then for a further update.""
Lampard, however, said Kante could be ready to face Ajax.

Government bans fracking ""with immediate effect""
02 Nov 2019, 00:01 by Edward Thicknesse
The government announced it has ended its support for fracking in the UK, following the publication of new scientific analysis.
Ministers took the decision on the basis of a report by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), which found that it is impossible to accurately predict the probability or magnitude of earthquakes linked to fracking operations.

Cuadrilla: more fracking this year in Lancashire unlikely

Business secretary Andrea Leadsom said: “Whilst acknowledging the huge potential of UK shale gas to provide a bridge to a zero carbon future, I’ve also always been clear that shale gas exploration in the UK must be carried out safely. 
“In the UK, we have been led by the best available scientific evidence, and closely regulated by the Oil and Gas Authority, one of the best regulators in the world.
“After reviewing the OGA’s report into recent seismic activity at Preston New Road, it is clear that we cannot rule out future unacceptable impacts on the local community.
“For this reason, I have concluded that we should put a moratorium on fracking in England with immediate effect.”
On Saturday morning chancellor Sajid Javid will announce a new Treasury review of the UK’s transition to a zero-carbon economy.
The news comes the same day that Labour announced plans to make all new homes zero carbon within three years. This could save people living in new builds £200 a year in energy bills.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “We will tackle the housing and climate crises at the same time by building warm and energy efficient homes.
“The next Labour government will usher in a Green Industrial Revolution to tackle climate change and create hundreds of thousands of green jobs.”
Tom Wheeler, the Oil and Gas Authority’s director of regulation, said: “Based on [the risk of induced seismicity], the OGA believes that further detailed geomechanical analysis would be needed before we could evaluate with confidence whether hydraulic fracturing could resume in the Fylde, or elsewhere, consistent with the Government’s policy aims.”

Operations at Preston New Road in Lancashire, which were run by Cuadrilla Resources, have been suspended since a magnitude 2.9 event was recorded on 26 August.
Other sources of natural gas will continue to contribute to the UK’s diverse energy mix. The committee on climate change has previously said that there will still be a requirement for natural gas in a 2050 net zero economy.
The decision to ban fracking comes a week after a report from the National Audit Office found that public opposition to fracking had doubled since 2013.
