Are Airlines About To Figure Out The Fastest Way To Board A Plane?

Oh, the irony. The airline industry knows how to fly jet planes, but can’t come up with a fast and efficient way to load passengers on a plane. Is it quicker to load passengers from the back of the plane to the front, as many airlines do? Or should the pattern be staggered, with incoming passengers skipping rows? Or is it faster to employ the so-called ""WILMA"" method — boarding passengers from the outside in, window seats first, then middles, then aisles?
Gatwick Airport aims to find out. At Departure Gate 101, the London airport has started using large digital screens to tell passengers the precise order in which to board. Over the two-month trial period, the team will test a range of sequences to determine how make the boarding process faster and less congested. One constant is that passengers who have booked priority boarding – or those who require special assistance or are traveling with young families – will still board first during the trial.
“Early indications are that this new technique has the potential to reduce the overall boarding time,” says Abhi Chacko, Head of Enabling Technologies and Digital Innovation at Gatwick Airport. “By communicating to passengers better and boarding passengers by seat number, we also expect to make the whole boarding experience more relaxing and, potentially, prevent large numbers of passenger rushing forward at any stage.”

But is this rocket science?

Gatwick anticipates that these techniques could reduce boarding times by up to 10 percent, compared to conventional methods. But that’s far less optimistic than the projections by Jason Steffen, an astrophysicist at Northwestern University, who created a computer algorithm to test different airline boarding methods over a decade ago. In 2008, Steffen’s model concluded that an optimized boarding strategy could reduce boarding time by a factor of four or more, depending on the aircraft size and configuration.
Coincidentally, 2008 was also when American Airlines began charging a fee for all checked bags, becoming the first legacy U.S. carrier to follow the lead of discount carriers like as Allegiant and Spirit. Most other major airlines quickly followed suit. As anyone who flies regularly knows, this industry policy shift has spawned millions of zealots who refuse to ever check a bag, which, in turn, has led to ubiquitous bottlenecks during the boarding process as passengers compete for overhead-bin space.

We’ve been to this rodeo.

If Gatwick’s tests sound strangely familiar, maybe it’s because you’ve already seen the TV show. In 2014, the Discovery Channel’s “Mythbusters” show recruited almost 200 volunteers and used a replica airplane interior to test six methods of airplane boarding.
Spoiler: The show found the traditional back-to-front boarding method to be the slowest method by far, with a time of 24.29 minutes. Southwest Airline’s boarding method – no assigned seats, no assigned order – proved to be the fastest, at 14.07 minutes, which was a whopping 47 percent faster than back-to-front. But, crucially, the mock passengers on “Mythbusters” also deemed this free-for-all method to be the least pleasant.
The best of the bunch turned out to be the WILMA method – boarding outside in – which was a close second at 14.55 minutes and far more popular among participants. As it turns out, Steffen's method is very similar to WILMA, with one tweak: Instead of calling window-seat passengers to board all at once, it creates a choreographed sequence to eliminate the possibility of anyone ever waiting.
When Gatwick’s experiment ends, let’s see if it merely corroborates Steffen’s research and what airlines have already known for over a decade.

Trump rallies supporters in Mississippi after House impeachment probe vote, ahead of tight governor's race
02 Nov 2019, 00:51 by Vandana Rambaran
President Trump rallied supporters in Tupelo, Miss., on Friday night in a bid to shore up Republican support ahead of the state's tightest gubernatorial race in nearly a generation.
Trump attacked former vice president and 2020 candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden over their Ukrainian business dealings, accusing the media -- specifically CNN's Anderson Cooper and Chris Cuomo, who again Trump referred to as ""Fredo"" -- of covering up potential Biden corruption.
""The press protects him,"" said the president, who also called Biden ""One Percent Joe.""


TRUMP ECONOMY HAS AMERICA'S MIDDLE CLASS 'SUCCEEDING,' TOP 2020 CAMPAIGN ADVISER SAYS


Trump also slammed the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, calling it a ""preposterous hoax"" one day after the House voted to formalize the rules of their impeachment process, and accused Democrats of trying to ""delegitimatize"" the 2016 presidential election.
House committees have held nearly a dozen closed-door depositions from witnesses regarding their knowledge of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. An anonymous intelligence community whistleblower has alleged that Trump sought to persuade Zelensky to open an investigation into Joe Biden, his son Hunter and their business dealings in Ukraine in exchange for military aid to the Eastern European nation.
""Do you think I would say something improper when I know there are so many people listening?"" Trump asked the crowd.
Beto 'a total fool'
The president also mocked former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, just hours after the Texas Democrat announced his withdrawal from the 2020 presidential election.
Trump called O'Rourke a ""poor bastard"" and a ""poor pathetic guy"" who ""made a total fool of himself"" in the race for the White House.
""Hopefully, we won't be hearing about him for a long time,"" Trump added.
""Hopefully, we won't be hearing about him for a long time.""— President Trump

Trump also decried Hillary Clinton's recent comments about Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii. The former secretary of state didn't mention Gabbard by name, but suggested that Gabbard was being groomed to be a third-party presidential candidate in 2020.
Trump said, ""I don't know who Tulsi Gabbard is but I know one thing, she's not an agent for Russia.""
Clinton made similar comments about 2016 Green Party candidate Jill Stein, to which Trump responded: ""I don't know Jill Stein ... I know she's not an agent of Russia.""
Baghdadi's 'ticket to hell'
The president opened his remarks at Bancorp South Arena by celebrating the U.S. military raid that led to the death of Islamic State (ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, saying it had ""ended his wretched life and punched out his ticket to hell.""
""We have a great military. It was very very depleted when I came into office ... but it ain't depleted anymore,"" said Trump, who called Baghdadi ""a savage and soulless monster but his reign of terror is over.""

Trump lamented the media's coverage of the military's most recent feat, saying that if former President Barack Obama had killed the leader of ISIS, the media would have the story ""going on for another seven months.""
""Conan the dog got more publicity than me -- and I'm very happy about it,"" Trump said of the heroic military dog who was injured while pursuing Baghdadi through a tunnel underneath a compound in northwestern Syria.
""Conan the dog got more publicity than me -- and I'm very happy about it.""— President Trump

""While we're creating jobs and killing terrorists, the Democrat Party has gone completely insane,"" Trump said.
Backing Tate Reeves
Hundreds of people had waited to see Trump at the rally to support Republican gubernatorial candidate Tate Reeves, who is finishing his second term as Mississippi's lieutenant governor after previously serving two terms as the elected state treasurer.



Reeves briefly joined Trump onstage and accused the ""radical liberals"" of ""disrespecting"" Trump by pursuing impeachment against him and urged the crowd to elect ""an ally to Donald J. Trump.""
""He'll never let you down,"" Trump said of Reeves. ""And don't kid yourself, your Second Amendment is under attack.""
Reeves has spent $10.8 million in the race to succeed term-limited Gov. Phil Bryant, while his Democratic opponent, state attorney general Jim Hood, has spent $5.2 million. Both are receiving financial support from national governors' groups in their parties.




VIDEOTrump blames Democrats' House election worries for resolution vote

Reeves has sought to tie Hood as closely as possible to national Democrats, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who are deeply unpopular in a state that voted heavily for Trump in the last presidential election.
Hood has not invited national Democratic figures to Mississippi and is running campaign commercials that show him with his family, his pickup truck and his hunting dog, Buck. In one, Hood unpacks a rifle and says that ""Tate Reeves and his out-of-state corporate masters"" are spending money on a ""bunch of lies.""

""You all know me. I've worked for you for years. I do my job and I'm a straight shooter,"" Hood says. The spot ends with Hood shooting the gun and shattering a bottle.
Hood is also running radio ads designed to appeal to African American voters — including one with an endorsement from former U.S. Rep. Mike Espy, who ran a strong but ultimately unsuccessful race for U.S. Senate in Mississippi last year, and another that mentions Hood leading the successful 2005 prosecution of Ku Klux Klan leader Edgar Ray Killen in the 1964 murder of three civil rights workers.
The outreach reflects the importance of black voters to any possible Hood victory. African Americans make up 38 percent of the state's population, but some say they're irritated by Hood's emphasis on courting rural white voters.
