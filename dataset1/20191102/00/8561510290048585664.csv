An Indonesian man who is a member of a group that helped draft harsh adultery laws was publically whipped Thursday after he was caught having an affair with a married woman.
Mukhlis bin Muhammad, 46, an Aceh Ulema Council (MPU) member from the Aceh region, was lashed 28 times in the provincial capital of Banda Aceh.
The woman was flogged 23 times.
He flinched and grimaced during the punishment, according to news reports.

""This is God's law. Anyone must be flogged if proven guilty, even if he is a member of the MPU,"" Husaini Wahab, the deputy mayor of Aceh Besar district, where Mukhlis lives, told the BBC.

The news outlet reported the couple were caught in September in a car parked near a tourist beach.
The council works with the local government to draft and implement religious law. Husaini said Mukhlis bin Muhammad will be expelled from the organization.
It was not clear what his role was.
Aceh, a deeply conservative region on Sumatra Island, practices Sharia law, a harsh interpretation of Islam. Offenses deemed punishable by flogging include extra-marital sex, gay sex and gambling.

Report: Trump to Ban All Vape Flavors Except Tobacco, Menthol
02 Nov 2019 by Victor Tangermann
It’s a terrifying epidemic: a mysterious vaping illness has gripped the nation and lawmakers are desperate to get ahead of it.
According to Axios, the Trump administration is set to announce a plan for a complete ban on all flavored vaping products next week — except for two noteworthy exceptions: tobacco and menthol flavors.
The Washington Post had previously reported that senior health officials wanted to make exceptions for tobacco, mint, and menthol flavors, since they are far more popular with adults than with children.
It’s an interesting development, considering Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has been quoted in the past saying that mint and menthol should also be included in the ban.
“These products are still getting to kids and we cannot let a whole generation get addicted to them through mint and menthol and other flavors,” Azar told reporters on September 11, the day the White House initially called for a vaping product ban.
On Monday, WaPo reported that mint and menthol were being reconsidered by the White House as exceptions to the ban, while tobacco flavor was set to get an exception regardless.
It’s a controversial move that’s bound to receive backlash. Some have called it bad policymaking and government overreach.
And others just say it will be ineffective.
“Excluding menthol would be huge — it means that kids will buy menthol,” public health attorney Desmond Jenson told the WaPo. “If you give them one flavor, that’s what they will buy. It doesn’t solve the problem.”
