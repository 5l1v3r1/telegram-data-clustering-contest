      <p>SHEFFIELD, England (AP) - Sheffield United returned to the Premier League after 12 years away with a mission to simply survive, but now it’s thriving.</p>
      <p>Two goals from John Lundstram lifted Sheffield to a 3-0 win over Burnley on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Sheffield rose to sixth place in the table following its fourth straight Premier League game unbeaten, with French forward Lys Mousset again playing a crucial role.</p>
      <p>Mousset was credited with assists on both of Lundstram’s goals, as well as John Fleck’s third goal.</p>
      <p>Mousset twice turned passes on for Lundstram to finish at the far post, and played a fine through ball for Fleck for the third. Mousset had scored three goals in Sheffield’s previous five league games, including the winning goal against Arsenal on Oct. 21.</p>

      <p>Lundstram could have made it a hat trick in the 70th minute, but shot wide from a good position.</p>
      <p>It was Burnley’s third straight league defeat, leaving Sean Dyche’s team four points above the relegation zone.</p>
