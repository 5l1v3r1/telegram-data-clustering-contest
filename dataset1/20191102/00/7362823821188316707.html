      <p>An <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/asia">Indonesian</a> man who is a member of a group that helped draft harsh adultery laws was publically whipped Thursday after he was caught having an affair with a married woman.</p>
      <p>Mukhlis bin Muhammad, 46, an Aceh Ulema Council (MPU) member from the Aceh region, was lashed 28 times in the provincial capital of Banda Aceh.</p>
      <p>The woman was flogged 23 times.</p>
      <p>He flinched and grimaced during the punishment, according to news reports.</p>

      <p>"This is God's law. Anyone must be flogged if proven guilty, even if he is a member of the MPU," Husaini Wahab, the deputy mayor of Aceh Besar district, where Mukhlis lives, told the BBC.</p>

      <p>The council works with the local government to draft and implement religious law. Husaini said Mukhlis bin Muhammad will be expelled from the organization.</p>
      <p>It was not clear what his role was.</p>
      <p>Aceh, a deeply conservative region on Sumatra Island, practices Sharia law, a harsh interpretation of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/islam">Islam</a>. Offenses deemed punishable by flogging include extra-marital sex, gay sex and gambling.</p>
