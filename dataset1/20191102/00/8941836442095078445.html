      <p>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A former New Jersey elementary school teacher who pleaded guilty to recording boys with a hidden camera at a summer camp has been sentenced to 17 years in prison.</p>
      <p>State prosecutors said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/thomas-guzzi-jr/">Thomas Guzzi Jr.</a>, 40, will be ineligible for parole for a decade as part of his sentence Friday on convictions of official misconduct, manufacturing child pornography and distributing child pornography files.</p>
      <p>The Pitman resident had taught fifth-grade at Winslow Elementary School in Vineland and was a stage manager for the Broadway Theatre of Pitman camp. He acknowledged having manufactured child pornography with video of teenage boys taken in restrooms during a 2015 summer camp and also having taken a photo of a boy exposing his genitals.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Rachael Weeks of the state attorney general’s office said the case involved “numerous crimes against more than nine child victims over the period of several years.” One victim was a special needs student, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>“This is not a single period of aberrant behavior,” Weeks said.</p>

      <p>NJ.com reports that the mother of one child said in a victim impact statement last month that she sobbed uncontrollably when she saw an image of her son that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/thomas-guzzi-jr/">Guzzi</a> had taken.</p>
      <p>“Moments like that change who you are,” she told the court. “I can still see the photo in my mind. When I think about it, my heart hurts.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/thomas-guzzi-jr/">Guzzi</a> apologized before sentencing, calling his actions “absolutely inexcusable” and said he deserved no sympathy, adding that he was thankful he had been caught because he can now change.</p>
      <p>“Somewhere in my sick, twisted mind, I thought that what I was doing had something to do with love,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/thomas-guzzi-jr/">Guzzi</a> said. “I now know this to be untrue. … “I know I still need help and I desperately want more help.”</p>

        <p>Defense attorney Edward J. Crisonino noted that his client has no prior criminal record and argued that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/thomas-guzzi-jr/">Guzzi</a> didn’t contemplate the harm his actions would cause.</p>
        <p>“He recognizes how serious and harmful his conduct was,” Crisonino said.</p>
