Su madre, Yolanda Sandoval, lo visitó el día de ayer 1 de noviembre en el Cementerio Parque el Manantial de Maipú para hacerle compañía y en conversación con La Cuarta indicó que ""nunca imaginé que iba a enterrar a mi hijo. Tengo 84 años y estoy con el corazón desgarrado"".
""No voy a descansar. Voy a luchar el resto que me queda de vida para que se haga justicia"", manifestó Yolanda; además aclaró que ese día, su hijo no estaba protestando, ""a él no le gustaba eso, solo salía con su hijo a ver a Colo Colo"", sentenció.
""Nadie del Gobierno se nos ha ha acercado, ni siquiera para dar una palabra de aliento. Los lo que sí lo han hecho, han sido artistas, como el grupo 'Los Miserables' u otros que de forma anónima han apoyado a mis hijos y les han escrito. También muchos chilenos que viven en España y Australia y otras partes del mundo"", cerró.

The capitalist system pointed out

Although climate change has been the subject of much publicity in recent years, particularly with regard to its negative impact on the environment, the Quebec Association of International Cooperation Organizations (AQOCI) has rather sought to address its unfair effects on the environment. This theme has emerged this year among members of the AQOCI, composed of solidarity and international cooperation organizations, to guide a significant part of its global education and advocacy activities. .
""While the subject is topical, but as organizations of solidarity and cooperation, we are also at the forefront to see that the most vulnerable countries are located in the south,"" says Michèle Asselin, executive director of the 'AQOCI. An analysis on the ground, which is corroborated by science. These countries are beginning to call on those in the North to restore this balance.
""These unequal relationships are a new form of colonialism, some researchers even talking about environmental racism,"" says Michèle Asselin. Canada has recently been reported to be sending waste to the Philippines, but it is also being seen as the burial of contaminants in the Americas, which contaminates water near native populations. ""

""Let's change the system, not the climate""

In addition to prioritizing climate justice in its activities this year, AQOCI has made it its theme for the Journées québécoises de la solidarité internationale (JQSI).
The slogan ""Change the system, not the climate"" particularly challenged Christian Vanasse, author, humorist and member of the Zapartists, who agreed to be the spokesman of the event this year, succeeding comedian Fred Dubé .
""The capitalist system in which 1% of the population owns more than half of the wealth creates a lot of inequalities and has accelerated this climate emergency to a point where we can say that we must save the planet,"" he said. -he. But it is not the planet that must be protected, it is humanity. The planet will survive us. ""
In his opinion, the only thing humans can do, which will have an influence on the climate crisis, is to attack the economic system in place.
His association with the event was quite natural, he who has repeatedly discussed the effects of globalization with The Zapartists, a group of Quebec comedians created in 2001 that was resolutely on the side of alterglobalists.
The JQSI aims to stimulate reflection on this issue through activities that will be held in 11 regions of Quebec from November 7 to 16. A lot of space has been given to young people, who are mobilized everywhere on the planet. To this end, an interactive map is available on the site, where you can watch videos of young people from all over the world who talk about their issues.
A major conference in three languages with simultaneous translation and webcast via Facebook will kick off the event on November 7th. Three women will speak: Tara Houska, an American lawyer in Native Law, who has been Indigenous Affairs Advisor for Bernie Sanders during the previous presidential campaign; Isabel Zuleta, spokesman of the Colombian movement for the defense of the territories and people affected by the dams in Colombia, and Catherine Gauthier, of the ENvironnement JEUnesse movement, instigator of the first collective action against the Canadian government for climate justice.

The boomerang effect of climate injustices

By focusing all its activities on climate justice, AQOCI wants to raise awareness about the first victims of climate change: the most vulnerable populations. Climate change is causing drought in southern countries, leading to famines that force people to migrate.
""These climatic migrants are all heading towards the nearest countries, which is putting enormous pressure on neighboring countries,"" explains Michèle Asselin.
Among vulnerable populations, women are particularly affected, often left alone after men have had to leave their villages to seek employment and provide family income. They must walk long distances with the children, exposing themselves to danger.
""Canada needs to work together so that the solutions found in the South can be realized,"" she says. As JQSI promotes citizen action, AQOCI is preparing a petition that will be submitted to the federal government on Earth Day, May 22. Among the demands are the 45% reduction of our greenhouse gases by 2030, without which we are moving towards a temperature increase of between 3 and 4 degrees.
By contributing to global warming, Canada will also suffer its consequences, especially its populations in the north, directly affected by the melting of glaciers, not to mention the flora and fauna.
""We need to mobilize $ 4 billion a year by 2020 to fund climate change adaptation or mitigation activities,"" she adds. Private companies should also help to raise this amount. They have their share of responsibility in this climate injustice. ""
While AQOCI is not against the realization of major sustainable development projects, it nevertheless recommends focusing on initiatives that have a direct effect on local communities.
""We must not forget the development of the social economy led by the groups living with the populations,"" she says. We must particularly support the leadership of women and Aboriginal people. These groups are very close to communities and families and are concerned about living conditions. This is where Quebec cooperation can play an ally role in several countries. ""
She recalled that the various groups affected and the countries of the South are not thumbing their heads while waiting for our help: they are mobilizing to find solutions, such as the project in Africa to create a green barrier in the north to slow down the progress of the desertification.
""We are forming a large chain on the planet, so every gesture counts, at every level, from citizens to governments,"" says Asselin.
