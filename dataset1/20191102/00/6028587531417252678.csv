Jolo Magcalayo won the Men’s Division at the fourth Menpora Emeralda International Amateur Golf Cup 2019 last October 24 to 26, 2019, at the Emeralda Golf Park in West Java, Indonesia.
Nicknamed “Go Low, Jolo” at the championships, the 17-year-old high-school junior from De La Salle-Zobel scorched the very tough course as he posted a three round total 12 under par 204 (69-69-66) to run away with an 11-stroke lead to bring home the crown.
Jolo went out of the gate with guns blazing as he opened the competition with an eagle birdie combo on the first two holes en route to a five under par front nine. This would cushion his two over par back nine to finish three under 69 and two strokes ahead of the second placed golfer from Myanmar.
He would go three under 69 again on the second day with his bogey free front 9 spiked by back-to-back birdie on the 5th and 6th holes combining with his one under par back nine to stay five strokes ahead of his closest pursuers.
Magcalayo would then put on a show on the last day. Going bogey free in the first 13 holes, Jolo birdied holes number 1, 4, 7, 12 and 13 before running into his first and only bogey in hole 14. He would then finish with a flurry scoring an eagle on the par 5 hole 17 to complete round with a six under par 66, an almost unheard of tournament score in the very tough course.
“I am very happy, of course, with my win. I came here to represent the Philippines well and thankful that I was able to make the most of the opportunities” said Magcalayo, who is preparing to play in the US in three weeks. He added, “My game is almost there already. I need to work on my irons more, but I will be ready for my next events in Thailand and the US.”
Magcalayo, a highly recruited US college recruit and the country’s highest ranked amateur golfer on the World Amateur Golf Rankings (WAGR), showed top-level preparedness as he travels to the US on November 18 to the US to compete in the American Junior Golf Association Rolex Tournament of Champions in Florida. The exclusive invitational event pits the AJGA All-American team members and AJGA tournament champions for 2019.
Magcalayo who won a championship and finished second in three AJGA events last summer will go head-to-head with the best junior golfers in the US in the said event.
He also left this week to play in the 12th Singha Junior World Golf Championship in Hua Hin, Thailand.
Magcalayo had a very successful US summer tour this year as he became the first Filipino qualifier to the US Junior Championship. Placed top 3 in a US Amateur sectional qualifier, won a Jr. PGA sectionals, and broke the first day tournament score and the course tournament scoring record. He also finished second in the 41st North and South Junior Golf Championship in historic Pinehurst, North Carolina.

‘A Colossal Discovery’: Here Are The Full Regigigas Special Research Tasks In ‘Pokémon GO’
02 Nov 2019 by Dave Thier


Pokemon GOCredit: Niantic

The ticketed “A Colossal Discovery” special research is now live in Pokémon GO. Not for North America, of course, but this thing goes live at 11:00 AM local time, and that means there’s been plenty of time for players across the world to get a look at it before the Eastern seaboard other United States gets a chance to see what’s what. Redditors posted the complete quest steps for the special research task hours ago, so we’ve now got an idea of what we’re working with. This comes to us courtesy of ttmoo123, posted on Silph Road:

Step 1:


Catch a Regirock, Regice or Registeel from a Raid: 3,000 XP
Catch 7 Rock Type Pokemon: Cranidos
Evolve 7 Rock Type Pokemon: Tyranitar
Rewards: 3 Golden Razz Berry, 3,000 Stardust, and 10 Great Ball


Step 2:


Catch a Regirock, Regice or Registeel from a Raid: 3,000 XP
Catch 7 Ice Type Pokemon: Lapras (can be shiny)
Evolve 7 Ice Type Pokemon: Abomasnow
Rewards: Sinnoh Stone, 3,000 Stardust, and 10 Great Ball


Step 3:


Catch a Regirock, Regice or Registeel from a Raid: 3,000 XP
Catch 7 Steel Type Pokemon: Shieldon
Evolve 7 Steel Type Pokemon: Steelix
Unova Stone, 3,000 Stardust, and 10 Great Ball


Step 4:


Take a snapshot of a Regirock: 3,000 XP
Take a snapshot of Regice: 3,000 XP
Take a snapshot of Registeel: 3,000 XP
Rewards: Exclusive Avatar Pose, Regigigas and 10 Candy

So, not much here, really. The hardest part is going to be completing three Tier 5 Raids, so you’re going to want to make sure you’re in a place with enough other people to get that taken care of, or that you’re in a group big enough to handle the things on your own. Other than that the only solid reward here is the exclusive pose and Tyranitar, but I have a feeling most people buying this ticket are already lousy with Tyranitar.
Other than that, it sounds like this is mostly just a Raid Day: we’re seeing nearly all gyms populated by Tier 5 raids featuring Titan Pokemon, all of which have shiny capability. Which is fine, aside from the fact that those are usually free. This was a big experiment for Niantic to see if it could deliver value for an event that costs $8 to participate in, and so far I’m not getting the feeling that the community thinks the developer has delivered on this promise. You do get Regigigas, but it seems like a bit of a light event, especially considering we’re not getting free research days anymore.
