      <p>MRG World expects to develop the project at an investment of Rs 200 crore. The construction work has started and the project will be completed by 2023.</p>
      <p>The flats are priced between Rs 21.7 lakh and Rs 25.8 lakh.</p>
      <p>"There is a dearth of affordable housing option in Gurugram with world class amenities. Our new offering â€˜The Meridian' is an attempt to fill that void," said Rajat Goel, Joint MD, MRG World.</p>
      <p>The customers can get interest subsidy offered by the Centre under the Prime Minister Awas Yojana.</p>
      <p>In its first housing project 'Balcony' that was launched in June this year, the company is developing 731 apartments in Gurugram under the affordable housing policy of the Haryana government at a project cost of around Rs 200 crore.</p>
      <p>Real estate developers across the country are focusing on the affordable housing segment to boost sales and beat a demand slowdown.</p>
      <p>Even the government is promoting this segment by charging only 1 per cent GST and offering an additional tax deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh on interest paid on home loans for units priced Rs 45 lakh and below.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
