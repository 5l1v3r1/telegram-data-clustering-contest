Lebron se poklonio Luki: Strašan igrač! Mnogo je lepo gledati njegov rast
Jedan od najboljih svih vremena hvalio momka čiji je bio idol

02 Nov 2019


Ceo košarkaški svet ne prestaje da priča o meču Dalasa i Lejkersa, a posebno o istorijskom duelu Lebrona Džejmsa i Luke Dončića!

Svedoci dešavanja u Amerikan Erlajnz Centru kažu da je ovo zasigurno bio duel godine, dok su Lebron i Luka očigledno posebno uživali u međusobnom nadmudrivanju na terenu. Obojica su na kraju upisali po jedan strašan tripl-dabl, ali je pobedu na kraju odneo trostruki NBA šampion. Ipak, dok je cela planeta zadivljeno gledala dvojicu majstora u akciji, po završetku utakmice Lebron Džejms se poklonio Luki Dončiću. Prišao mu je, zagrlio i samo kratko prokomentarisao: ""Strašan si je...č majke"".


DUEL GODINE! Kolosalni “tripl-dabl“ sudar Lebrona i Luke – da se pamti (VIDEO)


Iako u Lebronovom vokabularu često nema mesta za psovke, ovim tipičnim slengom želeo je da oda poštu Luki Dončiću i stavi mu do znanja koliko ceni njegovu igru i to što ga je naterao da se ozbiljno preznoji kako bi odneo pobedu. Svestan je i Lebron da mu je Dončić umalo potpuno ukrao šou, a američki mediji pišu o tome da je as iz Ohaja prepoznao talenat slovenačkog superstara.



U odvojenim izjavama posle utakmice, Luka i Lebron su pričali o tome koliko se dive jedan drugom.”Ovo je bilo ludo! On je moj idol i oduvek je to bio. Neverovatan je osećaj kada se nađete licem u lice s njim, pa još kada iskombinujete tripl-dablove na ovaj način... Stvarno je bilo posebno”, rekao je Luka, na šta se nadovezao Lebron:”Nikada ne znate koju ćete generaciju inspirisati da igraju košarku. Zaista je neverovatno saznanje da sam uspeo da inspirišem dete koje nikada nije odrastalo u SAD i igra košarku na pravi način. Toliko je uključen u igru i razmišlja samo o košarci. To je nešto posebno”.
Ne treba zaboraviti kako je javnost reagovala leta 2018. godine i osporavala Lukinu odluku da posle nezaboravne sezone u madridskom Realu ode u NBA...

02 Nov 2019 by Rafael Ramírez | The sun of Mexico
The Democratic Revolution Party (PRD) reported that it initiated a resistance movement in Baja California against the morenista governor Jaime Bonilla Valdez, called ""National Dialogue for the Construction of the Fourth Republic"", with the objective that the period of 2 be respected years for which Bonilla Valdez was elected.
During the formation of this resistance movement, Ángel Ávila Romero, on behalf of the Perredista Extraordinary National Directorate, protested Jaime Martínez Veloz as National Commissioner for Dialogue and Border Affairs.
In the protest, the national PRD leader said that the state requires struggles and counterweights in the face of the illegal attack against democracy that Jaime Bonilla intends to make and ""his minions.""
He stressed that this requires that the opposition be organized and start a protest movement headed by Jaime Martínez Veloz, whom he described as a respected person and with moral authority to help rebuild the social fabric that Baja Californians claim so much.
• Most support me and would not allow a coup: AMLO
Also, he warned that what is happening in Baja California is a reflection of what is happening throughout the country, “the polarization of society with the protest taking of a governor that divides society, which represents business, economic interests and petty that will only divide the state of Baja California. ”
He demanded that the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) legally resolve the term of Jaime Bonilla as governor of Baja California, as the company will not allow the imposition of the so-called ""Bonilla Law"", which is endorsed by the Federal Government and now by the Secretary of the Interior, Olga Sánchez Cordero.
He reminded the leaders of the Morena party in the state that during the campaign period they said they were “different, but now they only see some ambitious vulgars who are only interested in power for power by wanting to govern three more years without being have won legally at the polls. ”
He warned that the PRD will not allow this robbery and with this resistance movement ""we must put ourselves above them for the welfare of Baja California and the whole country,"" he said.
At the time, the National Commissioner for Dialogue and Border Affairs, Jaime Martínez Veloz promised to generate a national initiative and monitor government actions and the state Congress, in order to generate a scheme where all citizens and represent the popular will ”.
Before hundreds of supporters, the former PRD candidate endorsed the struggle commitment of social organizations and promised to lead this movement of social resistance with dignity, while lamenting the attitude of the Secretary of the Interior, who consumed a shameful act, "" He came to put the last nail to the coffin of what is known as 4T and we do not know where it starts, or where it ends. ”
• Every third day 9 million Mexicans eat
He added that Olga Sánchez Cordero is unaware that the Constitution of Baja California establishes in its article 27 that it is the Congress's powers to make known the decision of the State Electoral Institute so that the elected governor is in charge for only two years, which is what the Will of the Baja Californians.
“The Secretary of the Interior, which comes in the name of Andrés Manuel López Obrador at Jaime Bonilla's protest, validates the link and complicity between the Government of the Republic and the local actors linked to the ruling party and in this case they support a person who doesn't have the clegal ability to be governor in the State, ”he concluded.
The event was also attended by the president of the National Council of the PRD, Arturo Prida; the president of the State Executive Committee of the PRD, Abraham Correa; the Secretary General of the State Executive Committee, Omar Sarabia; the Regidor for Mexicali, Fernando Rosales; the Regidora de Ensenada, Leticia de la Rosa; Deputy Gerardo López; as well as representatives of civil society, indigenous peoples, entrepreneurs, young students, academics and hundreds of citizens concerned about the arbitrary and illegal expansion of the government from 2 to 5 years.
