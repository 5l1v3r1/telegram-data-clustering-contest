Virus spillover may be occurring between bats and humans: Study

02 Nov 2019, 00:30

A new study conducted by the Bengaluru-based National Centre of Biological Sciences (NCBS) along with two other health institutions has found that the transmission of viruses from one species to another may be occurring between bats and humans. The collaborative study by NCBS, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore and Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) has found that virus spillover – the transmission of viruses from one species to another – may be occurring between bats and humans in Nagaland. The study published in the scientific journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, reaffirms the importance of virus surveillance at wildlife and human interfaces where the risk of virus spillover (transmission) may be highest. According to NCBS tropical areas where hunted wildlife often supplements the locals’ meagre diets – such as in Africa, South and Southeast Asia – are hotspots for pathogen spillovers. During such spillovers, viruses from hunted wild animals or ‘bush meat’ infect humans and can lead to large scale outbreaks. In Nagaland, bat-hunting is practised by the Bomrr, a clan of the Longpfurii Yimchungii sub-tribe. According to their narratives, the Bomrrs have been holding a bat-harvesting festival in mid-October, with the seven generations. “During the harvesting, which usually lasts for two to three days, the Bomrr clam smoke out entire caves in which the bats roost and the hunters are often scratched and bitten by bats trying to escape the smoky cave, exposing them to viruses shed by the bats,” said Pilot Dovih, the study’s lead author. In this study, two species of bats, as well as humans engaged in hunting these bats, were found to have been exposed to viruses in the family Filoviridae, which includes Ebola and Marburg viruses. Although antibodies against two and three distinct filoviruses were found in the human and bat blood samples, no viral genetic material was detected in the samples. The pattern of reactivity of anti-filovirus antibodies carried by the humans was similar to those found in one bat species, which makes these bats the most probable source of the viral spillover event.

Chairman of PP Muhammadiyah: Many people have ties who are also evil

KBRN, Jakarta: Muhammadiyah's Central Chairperson (PP), Dadang Kahmad asserted that not all veiled women and men who wear cingkrang pants are radical people. Most of them are actually pious and pious people. He said that to criticize the discourse about the prohibition of wearing veils in government agencies by the Minister of Religion, Fachrul Razi. According to him, as the new minister, Facrul Razi should prioritize the scale of priorities rather than having to deal with the issue of clothing, or the veil. ""Fachrul Razi) is more focused on things that are very urgent. About intolerance, fostering (the ideology of Pancasila),"" he said when talking with Radio Republik Indonesia, Friday (11/01/2019). Because according to him, at this time, mainly since Presidential Election 2019, the unity of Indonesia as if in a state of emergency. Which every group has high egoism. It emphasized the attention of the government workers. ""Need our attention. Do not let anyone feel this group is the most meritorious, this group is less meritorious. Or also do not let any golden boys in the life of this state. We are both establishing a state, equally meritorious ""He said. The other main priority according to him is against ideologies that are considered to endanger the unity and integrity of the nation, and Pancasila."" Ideologies that endanger the state, endanger the unity and unity, ""he added."" Not all people who are framed are radical. people go up, people of pious, who build this nation he contributes to the goodness, wearing clothes, maybe it's just a matter of taste, ""he stressed. Because he emphasized, not all women who veiled or men wearing Cingkrang pants are terrorists, understand radical or intolerant. He further admitted, based on an in-depth study, the Muhammadiyah Tarjih Council had indeed issued that the niqab or veil had no basis in Islamic teachings. But Muhammadiyah does not necessarily forbid people to use the veil. ""We do not forbid in the sense of prohibiting people not. If it is recommended not to wear a veil. If (Muhammadiyah) prohibits it there is no right. That is their individuals to express their beliefs,"" he said. That is because according to him Muhammadiyah views that the veil is a form of expression of a person in carrying out his beliefs. ""We must continue to respect people's beliefs. Because it does not automatically reflect the crime,"" he added. Because not a few people have ties that actually become corruptors or do other evil things. ""Many bad people have ties, many have ties, many have skirts and many have bad ones. But we don't discredit it. Make it an expression of someone's identity. Some wear skirts, wear open, there are closed, there are closed once closed, that's part of people's expressions, ""he concluded. (Photo: muhammadiyah.org.id)
