Democratic Candidate Beto O'Rourke Announces Withdrawal from US Presidential Race
Former Texas Congressman Robert Francis ""Beto"" O'Rourke announced Friday that he would no longer continue his campaign toward securing the Democratic nomination in 2020 presidential election.

02 Nov 2019, 00:33

Citing a lack of ""means to move forward,"" O'Rourke revealed Friday evening that he is dropping out of the Democratic primary race and will instead find other ways to serve the country. 



The former Texas lawmaker did not move to endorse a fellow Democratic candidate, but instead asserted that he ""will work to ensure that the Democratic nominee is successful in defeating Donald Trump in 2020.""
According to the New York Times, which broke the story approximately three minutes before O'Rourke's announcement via Twitter, he initially planned to announce his withdrawal from the primary later on Friday evening. 
It's unclear whether this will actually be O'Rourke's final bid for elected office, but he did recently inform Politico that he may not run again. 
“I cannot fathom a scenario where I would run for public office again if I’m not the nominee,” O'Rourke told the outlet last month.  
Fellow candidates billionaire Tom Steyer, former US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro and Democratic Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren issued warm parting remarks to the former Texas lawmaker, but US President Donald Trump made it clear that there was no love lost. 



Speaking on his lack of ""means to move foward,"" O'Rourke noted that he did not rely on ""PACs or corporations but upon the grassroots volunteers and supporters from everywhere, especially from those places that had been overlooked or taken for granted."" 
Despite a lack of funding, O'Rourke was able to keep his name in the media over the past few months with polarizing comments concerning America being ""founded on white supremacy,"" Trump's anti-Mexican rhetoric and opinions on the current administration. 



He also drew ire from Democrats and Republicans alike over his proposed mandatory buyback program targeting Americans' assault weapons.

Turn back on the legal age of cannabis use
02 Nov 2019 by Nicolas Rioux
Minister Lionel Carmant,
Allow me, at first, to highlight your particular expertise in neurology, which certainly inspired your recent ministerial actions. You have repeatedly stressed the problem of the harmfulness of cannabis in young people, and in people with genetic predispositions to schizophrenia in particular.
The goal you had in mind seemed clear to me and you translated it well in this speech: ""When it comes to cannabis, my judgment is guided by one thing only: protecting the health of young people, by delaying the first time. consumption as much as possible, and especially by avoiding trivializing its use. ""
However, you have greatly disappointed me in the legislative means that you have used to meet this objective, namely by prohibiting the possession, sale and access to branches of the SQDC to persons aged 18 to 20 inclusive. To believe that cannabis causes physical and psychological harm is one thing, to believe that prohibition prevents young people from having access to this product is another!

The Portuguese example

The problem of the war on drugs is that no society has succeeded in curbing its illicit sources of supply. Logically, restricting access to a nationalized product in such a context is to encourage young people between the ages of 18 and 20 inclusively to go to the black market.
You might want to take notes on the Portuguese experience with drug control. So imagine that Portugal has decriminalized all drugs on its territory. And yet, surprising as it may seem, the consumption of illicit substances has decreased among Portuguese youth.
Why ? Among other things, the feeling of rebellion that led young people to consumption has been eliminated by tolerant public health policies (eclipsing your argument about trivialization). Among other things, too, because this openness has made it possible to democratize access to multiple public health resources, to encourage awareness, to promote the social reintegration of individuals with addiction problems, etc.
In contrast, repressive policies drive people to hide, to avoid seeking help and to feel ashamed of their consumption. The repressive policies also encourage the maintenance of the black market that the nationalization aims technically to fight since this market will then have the monopoly of the young people.
Moreover, as the quality of the black market products is not monitored, these are additional risks that young people will take by modifying their source of supply, to which are added the risks of violence, which are much higher in a context of illegal activities. In short, the tabling of your last bill will not diminish the accessibility of the product for young people. It will only change their source of supply, pushing them to turn to a much less secure option.

diversion

I repeat, far from me the idea of lambasting your noble intentions. In fact, your bill contains some interesting measures, including section 10, which prohibits the SQDC from operating a point of sale within 250 meters of vocational, college and university institutions. Still, Bill 2 as a whole will do more harm than good.
Overall, our society would benefit from following the harm reduction strategy adopted by other countries (examples from Italy and Spain are very interesting). The presence of supervised injection sites, awareness campaigns, the quality control of legal products and accessible therapies for people in need are worth a thousand times the vain attempts of state repression. I dream of the day when our society will see drug use and addiction as collective public health issues requiring diversion of the phenomenon.
In anticipation of further reforms towards the detachment from our society of our Judeo-Christian cultural baggage, I beg you, Sir, to listen to public health experts, sociologists, criminologists and all the other actors concerned. . Take the wise, pragmatic and adequate decision to turn back on the question of the legal minimum age of cannabis use in Quebec. Our whole society will benefit from a greater openness to the problems arising from the omnipresence of drugs, opening up which will allow a better individual awareness.
