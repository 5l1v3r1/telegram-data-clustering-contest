      <blockquote>"We have a dialogue with them [the United States] on Afghanistan. There is a Russia-China-US format that Pakistan has joined. There is interest in connecting Iran to this format. It can be promising", Lavrov said on Friday.</blockquote>
      <p>A confrontation between Afghan government forces and the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201910181077087156-kabul-condemns-mosque-blasts-in-east-afghanistan-blames-taliban---presidential-spokesman/">militants of the radical Taliban movement</a>, which had previously captured significant territory in rural areas of the country and launched an attack on large cities, continues. Daesh* has also increased its influence in Afghanistan. Afghan national defense and security forces are conducting joint counter-terrorism operations across the country.</p>
      <p>The issue of launching a direct peaceful dialogue between the opposing forces in Afghanistan is being discussed at various venues, including in Moscow, where in November last year, a private meeting on Afghanistan was held with the participation of representatives of regional states. For the first time, a Taliban delegation took part in the meeting. The Supreme Peace Council, which positions itself as a mediator between the government and the Taliban, also attended the meeting.</p>
      <p>In recent months, the US has been <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201910151077052997-india-boosts-afghanistans-might-with-attack-choppers-amid-us-taliban-peace-bid/">negotiating with the Taliban for a settlement</a> in Afghanistan. In early September, US Special Representative for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad said that the preliminary version of the agreement provided for the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201910221077112109-pentagon-plans-us-troop-exit-from-afghanistan-in-case-trump-orders-withdrawal---reports/">initial withdrawal of 5,000 of about 14,000 US troops</a> stationed in Afghanistan over the next 135 days. However, the signing of the agreement failed due to the position of US administration.</p>
