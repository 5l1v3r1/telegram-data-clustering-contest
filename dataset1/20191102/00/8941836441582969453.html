      <p>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) - Author, professor and activist <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marc-lamont/">Marc Lamont</a> Hill plans to speak at a Detroit-area gathering of Arab Americans aimed at confronting issues facing the community.</p>
      <p>Hill is set to speak Friday during a three-day conference called MOVE. It stands for Mobilize, Organize, Vocalize and Empower, and is being held at Dearborn’s Henry hotel.</p>
      <p>Organizers say Hill will discuss collective power and energizing communities into action.</p>
      <p>The Temple University professor is host of BET News. He was a CNN contributor, but they parted ways last year after he spoke about Israel and Palestine at the United Nations.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Hill called for a boycott of Israel and a “free Palestine from the river to the sea.” The Anti-Defamation League and other groups said the “river to the sea” phrase is code for eliminating Israel, but the professor said it was “not a call to destroy anything or anyone.”</p>
