RAF Camora's ""Zenith"" Dark but elegant
The Austrian Raphael Ragucci alias RAF Camora has presented with ""Zenit"" the compact and coherent essence of a long discography. After three extremely successful years is now at the peak of the career to be out of rap.
02 Nov 2019 by Axel Rahmlow in discussion with colleagues with Bernd Lechler
Bernd Lechler: The most successful Austrian in Germany since Falco is Raf Camora. In the last three years, three number 1 albums in Germany, hundreds of millions of streams, tours through large halls. And now it should be over. Yesterday, his new album ""Zenit"" has been released, for months RAF Camora tells us that it is his last. Since this title is even more to the announcement. We ask Axel Rahmlow, who has seen RAF Camora live, when only 100 people came. Did he actually climb a zenith now?
Axel Rahmlow: Yes. And he has reached an artistic climax, which is indeed the consequence of his career so far. I listened through the very long discography again, and this brief hour now, that is actually the best of 10 years. This is a very compact album, a harmonious album. That is dark, noble. It's also confrontational, but it's still self-reflective. That's already top dog music. But it is not obscene. And all in less than an hour. I found that to be even shorter when listening, because some of the songs are as exciting as one-minute plug-ins, so to speak. And in the total amount the title is then really well chosen.
Lechler: And this best, this essence, how has it developed over the years?
Rahmlow: Well, biographically speaking, Raphael Ragucci, that's his name, is the child of an Italian mother. He grew up in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Since he has got a lot of affinity for French rap. Then he moved on to a rough area of Vienna. Then he got street attire, also the influences from the Balkans. I would also say a certain inclination to melancholy.
Slope to melancholy
And in the basic ingredient of the music, that has always been rap. And that alone is of course not enough to stand out somehow. He's always had the courage, RAF Camora, to do something that was very frowned upon 10 years ago, and that's called singing. In fact, with his dark voice, he has been able to get more out of it than most rappers, and today, when it has become relatively normal, he benefits because he sounds much more harmonious and organic than many other artists. And for that I have another example, that is ""Nothing is nothing"".
