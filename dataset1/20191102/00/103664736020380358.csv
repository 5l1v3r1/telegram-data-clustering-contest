02 Nov 2019 by Cuyo Daily Writing
Serbian Novak Djokovic, world number one, beat the Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas in two sets yesterday and qualified for the semifinals of the 1000 Tennis Masters in Paris, France. Djokovic beat Tsitsipas (7th in the world) 6-1 and 6-2, in just 58 minutes of play, and advanced to his ninth semifinal of the year. For a place in the final, the Serbian will be measured with the Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov (27), who yesterday eliminated the Chilean Christian Garín (42) by 6-2 and 7-5 in one hour and 29 minutes. It was the first time that Garin, who played last year for Davis Cup at Aldo Cantoni Stadium, reached the quarterfinals in a tournament of this category.
In the other quarterfinals of the 1000 Parisian Masters, which is played on a hard surface under a roof and distributes 5,207,405 euros in prizes, the Spanish Rafael Nadal (2) beat the Frenchman Jo Wilfried Tsonga 7-6 and 6-1 ( 35), while the Canadian Denis Shapovalov (28) doubled by a 6-2 double to the local Gael Monfils (13).
