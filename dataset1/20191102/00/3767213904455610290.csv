Australian pop singer Tones and I is a non-mover at No. 1 on the U.K. singles chart this week with her breakout smash “Dance Monkey,” which has proven to be a big winner in almost every country on the planet. The cut has now led the charge for five frames, and it looks like it will continue for the coming few turns. Also steady is Regard’s “Ride It,” which is comfortable at No. 2 once again.New to the top 10 is Selena Gomez’s “Lose You to Love Me,” which vaults up the ranking, missing the top spot by only two rungs. The pop star’s new cut debuted at No. 65 last frame after just two days of availability, and now that it’s enjoyed a full tracking frame in which to rack up streams and sales, it has become a true hit.
As Gomez nabs the No. 3 spot, the next two tracks, Post Malone’s “Circles” and Ed Sheeran, Cardi B and Camila Cabello’s “South of the Border,” descend slightly, landing at Nos. 4 and 5, respectively.
As his new album Jesus Is King debuts at No. 2 (behind the latest Stereophonics title), Kanye West lands yet another top 10 hit in the U.K. with “Follow God,” one of the songs featured on the set. The most popular track from his new release marks his twenty-first appearance in the U.K.’s top 10. 
The third and last new entrant inside this week’s top 10 across the pond comes from R&B/pop/hip-hop powerhouse (in the making) Lizzo, who breaks into the tier for the first time. “Good as Hell,” a song featured on an EP she released years ago, is surging all around the world, and it jumps up the list this time around thanks to a new version shared recently that features Ariana Grande. While Grande may not be credited on the U.K. chart, she did help Lizzo beat her previous best showing.
The final three spots inside the new top 10 in the U.K. are owned by Maroon 5’s “Memories” (No. 8), Dermot Kennedy’s “Outnumbered” (No. 9) and Lewis Capaldi’s “Bruises” (No. 10).

Housewife, man of the future?
02 Nov 2019 by Sylvie St-Jacques
In 2018, while embracing the role of a full-time homemaker, Clarke Gayford, husband of New Zealand Premier Jacinda Arden, was a model of assumed and equal masculinity. In a relationship with one of the most influential women in the world, Gayford took charge of caring for the new baby when the head of state returned to work after six weeks of maternity leave. By entrusting Gayford with the care of her little Neve, Jacinda Arden conveyed the message that the male part of a cisgender couple can very well take on the role of full-time parent.
New Zealand may be a distant country, the example of the Arden-Gayford is enough to inspire many employers and (future) Quebec dads. When a (young) generation of fathers adheres uncompromisingly to the role of primary caregiver, one can only be optimistic about the future of gender equality.
In Quebec (as everywhere else in the western world), feminists, social workers, sociologists and even cartoonists are examining the impact of mental stress on the well-being of families. Certainly, starting in the 1970s, women began to invest more significantly in the sphere of the paid labor market, which had an undeniable effect on gender roles. On the other hand, as Maude Pugliese, a professor and researcher at the National Institute of Scientific Research recalled in the compendium The Unfinished Revolution of Shared Work, women have remained responsible for the vast majority of household chores.

""Latte dads"" and other breakers of male stereotypes

Sweden, the cradle of more than one progressive-oriented society, has witnessed the birth of a new generation of ""post-metrosexual"" dads in the last decade. Nicely nicknamed ""latte papas"" (because of their visible presence in cafes), these Scandinavian models of full-time paternity are known for their impeccable style and their choice to take care of the little ones while their spouse returns to work. job.
And the country of Greta Thunberg is not totally apart: recent figures from Statistics Canada reveal that 10% of Canadian families in Canada had a homemaker in 2015, a significant improvement over were 1 in 70.
Although the vast majority of stay-at-home parents in Canada are women, a growing number of men become fathers at home. A 2018 Pew Research Center study, however, found that in the United States, the percentage of men who have been full-time housewives has increased from 4% to 7% since 1989, while women in this role remained about the same (27%, down 1% from 1989).
That said, things are also moving towards the affirmation of the role of father: the latest publication of Modern Families Index (published by the British organization Working Families) revealed that half of the men interviewed for this study wanted to reduce its paid workload to contribute more to child care and a third was willing to accept lower wages to achieve a better work-life balance. And the younger the men, the higher these numbers tended to be.
This recognition of the role of father inspired by the Gayford-Arden and popularized by social movements like the Swedish ""latte papas"" offers a glimmer of hope for those who are worried about the reproduction of gender stereotypes. In her essay, If we are equal, I am the fairy of the teeth, the author and social worker Amélie Châteauneuf draws a note tinged with a note of exasperation about the inequality that persists in the under-studied domain of the sharede domestic tasks and care for children.
""The work of care, organization and maintenance performed largely by women is not only unpaid work, it is also a job that impoverishes them because it prevents them from working. do as many hours of paid work as most men and contribute so much for retirement (older women have 59% of men's retirement income), ""writes Châteauneuf, who quotes here a study of 2017 the Federation of Quebec Women.
And in terms of equality of parental roles, it may be necessary to look at same-sex parents: Amélie Châteauneuf's book reveals that gay fathers are more successful in the egalitarian distribution of the famous ""charge"". mental. ""
The modern family has everything to reinvent in terms of healthy and assumed paternity. In 20 years, Neve Arden-Gayford will confirm that.
