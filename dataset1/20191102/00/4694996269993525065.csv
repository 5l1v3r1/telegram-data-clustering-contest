According to a New York Times/Siena College poll of likely Democratic candidates, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, surpasses former Vice President Joe Biden for second runner-up. Senator Elizabeth Warren is first, slightly ahead of Senator Bernie Sanders.The presidential candidates have been under scrutiny of the disability community for ignoring them as a voting population in the early campaigning stages. While each of the candidates set foot in their candidacy announcements by appealing to the other minority groups, such as people of color, immigrants and the LGBTQ community, they didn’t make the same conscious effort for the disability community, the nation’s largest minority group.
After hearing the cries from the disability population, the 2020 democratic presidential candidates are slowly, but surely, beginning to address them.
With the Iowa caucuses just three months away, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is the latest candidate to release an exclusive disability policy plan, following Senator Kamala Harris’ lead from August.
In a White Paper released this morning on the mayor’s website, titled Dignity, Access, and Belonging: A New Era of Inclusion for People with Disabilities, the campaign team writes, “As President, Pete will build a culture of belonging for everyone. He is committed to systematically dismantling institutions that discriminate against people with disabilities, and, with and alongside them, helping to build a new, long-overdue era for this community. Pete will retrofit our government, so it works for—and not against—people with disabilities. He will help bring about a society that intuitively sees, accounts for, welcomes, and values their lived experiences.”
Mayor Buttigieg’s campaign team sought expert input from the community and staff in shaping the most comprehensive disability policy plan in the 2020 field to date. This is the candidate’s latest effort to be inclusive of people with disabilities, following his promise to hire them as campaign staff last April.
In a 19-page report, the office of Mayor Buttigieg outlines in detail the executive plan he plans to enact if elected president to improve the quality of life and to increase educational and vocational opportunities for people with disabilities.
Policies and programs are outlined in the following: 


Competitive Integrated Employment


End the subminimum wage.
Double labor force participation rates of people with disabilities by 2030, the 40th anniversary of the Americans with Disability Act.
Create a national network of apprenticeships and an Internships for All program that provide
greater opportunities for competitive integrated employment.
Increase federal subcontracting with disability-owned businesses, including by enforcing Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act.
Ensure all workers have access to paid sick leave and 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave.


Education

Increase funding to recruit, support, and retain special education teachers.
Expand trauma-informed care and healing-centered engagement in schools.
Ensure services for students with disabilities don’t end in high school.
Strengthen Title IX protections and support students with disabilities who face sexual assault in college.


Civil and voting rights


Reinvigorate enforcement of Olmstead v. L.C. and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the DOJ Civil Rights Division to aggressively protect the rights of disabled people.

Make sure that parents with disabilities do not lose custody or adoption rights based on the fact that they have a disability.
Train first responders and police to identify and appropriately respond to individuals with disabilities.
Make the voting process and polling places accessible to everyone.

Eliminate SSDI’s ineffective current work incentives.
Reduce excessive wait times for SSDI and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) appeals cases.
Enable SSDI participants to start receiving income benefits as soon as they are admitted to the program.
Eliminate SSDI’s 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage.
Update critical SSI thresholds to allow people to receive greater assistance as costs of living rise.

Enhance the Medicaid program to ensure people with disabilities on Medicaid have access to care in their homes and communities, including by ending waitlists for waiver programs.
Raise standards for pay, benefits, and training for direct care workers.
Lower burden on unpaid family caregivers, including by providing credit toward Social Security.


Accessible transportation


Require transportation projects with federal funding to be certified as 100 percent accessible.
Incentivize private taxi and ride-sharing companies to offer accessible services.
Ensure that air travel is accessible.
Promote safe streets by incentivizing states to work with cities and counties to build accessible roadways and increase accessible sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian signals.
Expand accessible transportation in rural communities.


Health care


Ensure people with disabilities have affordable coverage through Medicare for All Who Want It.
Expand access to telehealth to make it easier to receive health care at or near one’s home.
Dramatically reduce drug prices, as outlined in Pete’s Affordable Medicines for All plan.
Mental health care
Ensure that every American has access to comprehensive coverage for mental health care.
Dramatically increase access to community-based mental health care services through annual $10 billion Healing and Belonging grants.


Housing and disaster preparedness


Ensure people with disabilities can find safe and affordable housing by reinstating the
Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule.
Combat the epidemic of homelessness among individuals with disabilities.
Dramatically increase accessible public housing by prioritizing accessibility in new construction and rehabilitation.
Help ensure that people with disabilities participate in disaster preparedness efforts and, after a disaster, can return to their homes and communities.


Inclusive technology

Develop an Accessible Technology Bill of Rights
Prioritize the goal of full digital inclusion across all federal agencies.


Global leadership


Strongly support ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Advance the human rights of persons with disabilities globally.
Develop a national strategy for disability-inclusive international development.


A recent survey shows that fully three-quarters of likely voters either have a disability themselves or have a family member or a close friend with disabilities. The study was endorsed by former Representative and Dallas Mayor Bartlett, who was a primary author of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990.
Presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg’s latest release of the white paper will grasp the attention of many voters who have a connection with disabilities. There will also be critics among the crowd who will view his multi-faceted plan as too ambitious or ill-focused.
As the youngest contender in the running, Buttigieg doesn’t have that much experience under his belt, let alone experience with implementing disability policies. As mayor, the only notable initiatives regarding disability that he has done are making a neighborhood park playground accessible, including accessibility in the Smart Streets project and expanded the local Human Rights Commission, where EEOC complaints are investigated. Although community members with disabilities will surely benefit from those initiatives, disability inclusion wasn’t the central force that drove the mayor to implement those plans. Instead, disability inclusion and accessibility were seemingly byproducts of such projects.
Perhaps with youth comes more opportunities to grow and tackle more things in the further. However, as much as it is commendable that Buttigieg and his team came up with this all-inclusive disability plan, the people in this community will eagerly wait to see how much of it actually gets implemented, if he is elected President.

From Blaise Diagne to Me Yérim Thiam: These Senegalese ""brothers"" who have assumed their belonging to Freemasonry.
02 Nov 2019 by Dakaractu
Assuming one's membership in Freemasonry in a country like Senegal is not always easy. This is why Senegalese ""brothers"" and ""sisters"" who live in Senegal have not always wanted to see their affiliation to a rumored room. Under our tropics, being part of a Masonic lodge is not well seen and disastrous consequences can befall those who would have tempted to play the exceptions.
Nevertheless, some members of the Senegalese elite braved this ""forbidden"" and posted, voluntarily or by a combination of circumstances, their membership of Freemasonry whose arrival in Senegal dates back to the 1700s.

Blaise Diagne, an assumed mason

First African deputy elected to the French Chamber of Deputies, he was initiated to Freemasonry in the Lodge Antite of the Grand Orient of France, September 21, 1898, in Saint-Denis de la Reunion. He entered the master's degree in 1901 and was the venerable master of the Pythagoras Lodge from 1922 to 1926. Blaise Diagne remained active until his death, which occurred in 1934 in France as a result of a malaise. To honor him, one of the Dakar lodges bears his name.

It was at the invitation of this lodge, which celebrated its 30th anniversary in Senegal, that the former Grand Master of the Grand Orient of France, Jean-Michel Quillardet (2005-2008) made the trip to Dakar in 2007. On this occasion, he welcomed the breakthrough of Freemasonry in Senegal. ""Here you have three lodges. We can say that the number is estimated at 200, even if I do not control the numbers. It is a masonry in full development, dynamic. Besides, just now, I was dressed and there was all the brothers in Dakar who were together. I noticed that there were a lot of young people. There is even a brother who made a board who told us that he is 30 years old. This is very important because in France, masonry, for some years, is a little old, even if we see all the same that there is a return of the interest of youth to masonry. But here, it is a masonry at once dynamic by the civil status, but also and especially because the lodges and the brothers completely adhere to the project of the Grand Orient "", he exulted in an interview with the national daily,"" The sun "".

Wade, mason by curiosity

In a survey entitled ""African Heads of State ... and Freemasons"", signed Vincent Hugueux, the Express reveals the links of the then president of Senegal with Freemasonry. ""In Senegal, Abdoulaye Wade, once initiated in Besançon, is a"" sleeping mason "". In fact, he would have taken his distance from his lodge for ages. Especially since the polite octogenarian must take into account the oukases of Muslim dignitaries, be they the caliphs of confrère Islam or the imams of the suburbs of Dakar. A few years ago, the daily Walfadjri echoed a fierce controversy that hardly turned to the advantage of Freemasonry, relegated by the most virulent to the rank of satanic sect, ""wrote our colleague. Back to the wall, President Wade, who was finishing his second term after winning the 2007 presidential election in the first round, was forced to put an end to the controversy created by this article in the French newspaper. However, in his response, Wade does not deny having flirted with Freemasonry.

In an update published by the same newspaper, the third president of Senegal said he is not a ""sleeping mason"" as the Express suggests. The ""Pope of Sopi"" claims to have been written off after he resigned 40 years ago.
Regarding the reasons that led him to take the plunge, Wade summons curiosity. ""When I was a young teacher, one of my colleagues often had to talk about masonry. Out of curiosity, I joined, hoping to find intellectual exchanges of very high level. It was not the case, ""he argues. These explanations did not extinguish the controversy but had the gift of highlighting the old friends of the predecessor of Macky Sall.

Me Yerim Thiam, sold by the GLNF

Since then, no member of the Senegalese elite had occupied the front of the scene for his assumed membership in Freemasonry. It took Dakaractu to look at an event sponsored by the French National Grand Lodge (Glnf) to learn that a lawyer, and not least, does not hide at all his affiliation to what is considered by many Senegalese as a sect "". Celebrating 50 years of regular presence of Freemasonry in Africa, the Kumen Colloquium was organized on November 29, 2018. The event was co-organized by the French National Grand Lodge (Glnf) and the Grand Lodge of Senegal ( lgs).

It is written on the document accessible on the site of the Grand National French Lodge that ""After the reception by the Grand Master of the French National Grand Lodge Jean-Pierre SERVEL, TRF Yérim Thiam, Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Senegal , will open the debates "". ""The TRF Alain Roger Coefe, Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Burkina Faso, will feed reflections devoted to the various aspects of the development of Freemasonry in Africa. A round table will occupy the afternoon on the theme ""perspectives and benefits of Freemasonry in Africa"". The day will be closed by the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Senegal "", informs the page devoted to the event. The Senegalese delegation led by Yérim Thiam, who is none other than Me Yérim Thiam, a lawyer practicing at the Dakar Bar, also included the Grandma deputy and the Grand Master Assistant of the GLS.

If at the moment we could not identify the Grand Master assistant of the Grand Lodge of Senegal, we could put a name on the Deputy Grand Master. During the French Grand Lodge held on December 2, 2017 in France, Me Yérim Thiam was accompanied by Antoine Chami, presented as the Deputy Grand Master of the GLS.

Yérim Thiam replaces the godfather of Denis Sassou Nguesso and defends the ""brother"" Bassolé

From our investigations, it appears that Me Yerim Thiam replaced Armand Agboba as Grand Master of the GLS. Renowned architect, he initiated to Freemasonry the current president of Congo Brazzaville. It is still the same Agboba who installed Denis Sassou Nguesso at the head of the Congolese Grand Lodge on October 25, 2014, at the Masons' house in Brazzaville, at the time revealing the highly informed Lettre du Continent.

It is therefore clear that the predecessor of Me Yerim Thiam at the GLS was in a dynamic to spread Freemasonry in Africa. A lineage in which appears the lawyer who in addition to co-chair symposia like last year at the Grand Temple Jean Mons of the LNG, puts the toga, if the need is felt, to defend ""Brothers"" in difficulty. This was recently the case in Burkina Faso where he defended General Djibril Bassolé, accused of having, with General Gilbert Diendéré, attempted to overthrow the transitional government in 2015.

Former Minister of Foreign Affairs under Blaise Compaore, Djibril Bassolé was penned at the post in the Grange Loge of Burkina Faso by Alain Roger Coefe, installed, according to the Letter of the Continent, by the former Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Senegal , Armand Agboba. The same Coefe who was with Me Yérim Thiam at the Kumen Colloquium of November 2018. Very involved in this legal battle, the Senegalese lawyer did not deprive himself of a platform to qualify the trial of ""politics"". In the end, he did not manage to bail out his ""brother"" Bassolé. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for treason by the military court of Ouagadougou.
