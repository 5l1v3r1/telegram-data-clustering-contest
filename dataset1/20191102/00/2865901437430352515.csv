Scandal directed by Djigi Ninkovic! He quarreled with a teammate about penalties and left the game
Serb lost his temper in a Serie B match

02 Nov 2019

Ever since he appeared in professional football, Nikola Ninkovic has been rumored to be a rare talent but also a ""hothead"". Often he was able to impress with moves and goals, but also to completely jump out of the track and bear a favor to himself or his team.
Since leaving Partizan in Italy, the popular Jiggy has struggled and sought out the right role, to make a great move last year by moving to the ranks of sophomore Askoli. There, with six goals and seven assists last season, he revived his career, and even better started the current season. Ascoli is one of the more pleasant surprises of the season, currently ranked fifth on two points to second-ranked Perugia and a spot leading to Serie A, and Ninkovic has three goals and seven assists (including the Italian Cup) in 13 matches games.
However, he showed today that nature has not changed and he has completely lost his compass by directing a scandal reported by the entire Italian sports public.
In the match against Venice at 0: 0 in the 70th minute a penalty was awarded to Askoli. Ninkovic wanted to take the harshest punishment, but his teammate Alesio de la Cruz wanted the same. There was an argument between the Serbian and Dutch footballers over who was going to take the penalty, and De La Cruz eventually 'won'. He took a penalty and hit, but that was not the end.
Outraged Ninkovic did not want to accept that his teammate had 'stolen' a penalty, so to the surprise of those present he asked the coach to take him out of the game because he did not want to play anymore. He approached the bench and insisted on having his coach replace him. Ascoli strategist Paolo Zaneti 'obeyed' and replaced him, but on that occasion criticized him and sent him straight to the locker room. ""I cannot take responsibility for his behavior. We apologize to the fans and everyone. Asking for a change was disgusting,"" he said is Coach to Get Busy after the match.
Antonio Tesoro, the club's sporting director, also announced. ""Ninkovic is disappointed because he clearly has no influence on the team like last season. That makes him nervous. But until he calms down, it is of no use to us for the team. We tried to show understanding for him, but we couldn't do it anymore. we take some measures. I do not rule out the possibility that Ninkovic could be expelled from the team after this.
This is not the first time this season for Ninkovic to make an affair. Recently, in the defeat of Cremonese, he was replaced after which he made a show, furiously kicked and hit the bench.
