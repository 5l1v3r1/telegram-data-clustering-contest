02 Nov 2019, 00:33 by Notimex
El Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Ifetel) aprobó a The Walt Disney Company y Twenty-First Century Fox una prórroga de seis meses al período de desincorporación para vender el negocio Fox Sports en México.
El organismo regulador informó en un comunicado que la orden de desincorporar el negocio Fox Sports en México es una de las condiciones impuestas el pasado 11 de marzo por el pleno para autorizar que Disney adquiriera activos.
La orden de desincorporar de Fox Sports en México respondió a que, antes de la concentración, tanto Disney como Twenty-First Century Fox tenían participaciones significativas en el mercado de los canales deportivos para televisión de paga, que en conjunto habría representado alrededor de 70%.
El Instituto ordenó por ello a las partes dejar a Fox Sports a un administrador independiente; las gestiones para la desincorporación efectiva a un agente de desincorporación, y las funciones de auditoría para el cumplimiento de todas las condiciones a cargo de un auditor independiente.
También otorgó un plazo de seis meses, prorrogables por una sola ocasión y un periodo igual, para realizar la desincorporación, para lo cual las partes tendrían que presentar la solicitud correspondiente.
Así como acreditar que exista causa justificada para pedirla y que el negocio Fox Sports en México se encuentre y mantenga completamente separado, independiente y viable. Asimismo, debe acreditarse el mejor esfuerzo del agente de desincorporación para vender el negocio a desincorporar.
De la información entregada por las partes y el auditor independiente, el Ifetel determinó que la solicitud de prórroga cumple con los requisitos establecidos, además todos los activos de Fox Sports en México se encuentran plenamente identificados y separados.
También se acredita el mejor esfuerzo del agente de desincorporación para vender Fox Sports en México, pues el agente ha demostrado la existencia de compradores potenciales que requieren de mayor tiempo para conocer y revisar el negocio a desincorporar.
El primer periodo de seis meses otorgado para la desincorporación comprendió del 1 de mayo al 1 de noviembre de 2019, con la prórroga, el periodo de desincorporación se extiende al 1 de mayo de 2020.
""Tratándose de la venta del negocio Fox Sports México, la resolución establece que los posibles compradores deban contar con una autorización previa del Instituto para prevenir que tal adquisición genere riesgos al proceso de competencia y libre concurrencia.""

The Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party: Unanimously resisting external pressure
02 Nov 2019, 00:43 by Voice of Germany


What we want you to know is that many Chinese people now regard this trade war as a siege to China, with the aim of curbing the rise of China. Hong Kong’s violent protests were opposed by most Chinese. The patriotism of ""not supporting us is against us"" has not been as clear as it is now for a long time.



Text: Frank Sieren (life in Beijing for more than 20 years)
The Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing from Monday to Thursday (October 28 to October 31).
In the past, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China also occasionally announced major decisions. The most important for China and the world are: the formulation of the reform and opening up policy in 1978 laid the foundation for China's economic prosperity; in 2013, the first-child policy that has been implemented for 34 years was relaxed for the first time. Then there is the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held in February 2018 to revise the constitution of the Communist Party, so that Xi Jinping can be governed for life, not only for two consecutive terms.
Delayed meetings sparked speculation
The news of the Fourth Plenary Session this week was not announced until last week. And as always, the meeting is not open to the public. It has been 20 months since the last meeting, which is the longest interval in decades. This of course also caused all kinds of speculation: Is the meeting postponed because of serious struggles within the party? Or is it waiting for the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China? Is the opposition to the president of the country and the general secretary of the CPC Central Committee Xi Jinping and the expansion of power desires increasing? Or is he so strong that he does not need to hold regular meetings of the CPC Central Committee?
Some people think that the tone of the national media reflects the first statement. But for the same thing, others are interpreted as a symbol of a more stable state. The ""all-party"" is responsible for ""an important strategic task of advancing China's institutional modernization and strengthening its ability to govern."" To this end, ""the party's leadership must be strengthened."" And to maintain the rule of law. Is this a request for Xi Jinping’s opponents to unite? Or Xi Jinping wants to announce that: Everything is under control! Or is it both? Unfortunately, we don't know about this, maybe we don't want us to figure it out.
However, one thing is clear: Xi Jinping wants to expand his power. It is also clear that the overwhelming majority of the people are more eager to strengthen order, or hope to have an iron fist, so they support Xi Jinping. If China holds free elections today, the most promising candidate will not be a Chinese Barack Obama, but a politician who is tougher than the current party and state leaders. It is precisely because of this that the Chinese government’s “Guidelines on Citizen Moral Education in the New Era” released on Sunday (October 27) is much less forcibly instilled by Chinese people than we in the West. The document emphasizes that ""when traveling, eating or participating in sports events"", ""all should safeguard China's dignity.""

Trump’s help to Xi Jinping exceeded his injury
Specifically, if anyone outside makes irresponsible remarks, it will not only damage themselves but also damage China's reputation, so it is bound to be countered by China. The trade war provoked by US President Donald Trump is therefore also available. Now many Chinese people regard this trade war as a siege to China, with the aim of curbing the rise of China. Hong Kong’s violent protests were opposed by most Chinese. The patriotism of ""not supporting us is against us"" has not been as clear as it is now for a long time. And the Chinese official media is also cheering for them: we Chinese must unite to resist external pressure! Therefore, it can be said that Trump’s trade war has brought more help to Xi Jinping than harm.
For China, this is very important. Because China faces enormous challenges. The growth rate of the Chinese economy has not met expectations. Industrial profits fell by 5.3% in September. However, consumption from January to September increased by 8.2%. However, the weak market in the automotive industry is mainly due to the delay in the purchase of new cars due to the transformation of traditional vehicles into electric vehicles. In addition, a piglet doubled the price of pork. The Chinese directly feel this through the wallet, but this is not enough to cause social unrest. China’s national debt continues to increase, but foreign debt is small, so it will not face the pressure of foreign creditors. People in China will not feel this. Inflation is insignificant.
China still needs economic growth
As China’s Xinhua News Agency reported, the world today is in a “big change in a hundred years.” In addition, China faces a series of long-term challenges, such as an aging population, a growing shortage of college graduates, and a prosperous coastal There is a gap between the region and poor provinces such as Guizhou or Gansu. For a country with a population of 1.4 billion, all these are difficult tasks that are difficult to accomplish. Therefore, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China must discuss the economy or, more precisely, discuss economic growth.
In fact, China can achieve economic growth by further opening up to the outside world. For example, restrictions on foreign banks, investment companies and asset managers have been completely removed. In addition, foreign investors should be allowed to hold majority and wholly-owned shares in more areas. After the Fourth Plenary Session, it is possible to further relax market regulation and reduce the negative list of investment and trade. This is not only to reduce trade disputes with the United States, but also to show foreign investors and private entrepreneurs in China that the country has not placed its strategic interests above the market.
