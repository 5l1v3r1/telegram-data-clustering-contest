Macy’s Thanksgiving parade balloons already tested in flight

02 Nov 2019

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) - Thanksgiving is more than three weeks away, but this year’s new giant balloons for the Manhattan parade were already out for a test flight.
The stars of the spectacle appeared at the Meadowlands sports complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on Saturday to make sure they hold up in the wind.
The lineup for this year’s parade features Astronaut Snoopy, Netflix’s “Green Eggs and Ham” and SpongeBob SquarePants and Gary, while heritage balloons include fan favorite Smokey Bear. Unveiled this year will be contemporary artist Yayoi Kusama’s balloon “Love Flies Up to the Sky.”
On Saturday, the piloting teams guided the balloons around the Meadowlands parking lot.

The 93rd Thanksgiving Day Parade steps off on Nov. 28 in New York City.

A spokesman for the judiciary called the statistics on illegal abortion in the country invalid.
Gholamhossein Ismaili, head of the judiciary, told social activists and elites in the area of abortion: ""The statistics on abortion are not valid.""
