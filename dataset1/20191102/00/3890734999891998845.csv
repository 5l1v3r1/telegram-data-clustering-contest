Mohsen sandy mocked wars to defeat it!
""Happy Nights Bombing"" deals with the Iraqi writer in the US bombing of Iraq, and practiced experimentation in form and style and the use of real characters.
02 Nov 2019 by Intissar Abdel Moneim
Mohsen Al Ramli is an Iraqi novelist, translator and poet who lives in Spain. His distinguished works include ""Happy Nights Bombing"" and ""President's Gardens"". Although he speaks of war in both works, we cannot say that the writer repeats himself, but we find ourselves in front of two completely different works, this difference which results from the writer's ability to differentiate himself, and his ability to diversify the narrative methods, even if dealing with the same The book ""Happy Nights of Shelling"" by Dr. Mohsen Al-Ramli, issued in 2003, which dealt with the US bombing of Iraq, and practiced experimentation in the form and style and the use of real characters as heroes through which the events through the sarcasm and cynicism to mitigate the scenes of destruction, and circumvent the painful reality Who can't change it. It is noteworthy that we do not find on the outer cover or internal classification of the book either to a novel or a collection of stories, but we find on page (5) a statement of content includes: Book bombing (collage narrative), including: the night of writing nights bombing, the first bombing, the date of bombing . The first volume, the childhood of the world, and the history of the bombing. The second volume, the world teenager, and the history of the bombing. The third volume, the aging of the world, and then the linguistic bombardment.
In both works, al-Ramli succeeded in choosing methods of narrative, leaning on his basic idea that over half a century, the lives of ordinary people, wars, siege, mass graves, and the chaos of occupation had not changed.
Ramli begins with a scene of his participation in a demonstration against the American military base Moron in Cadiz / Spain, which took part in more than ten thousand people, each party or group, including the reasons for objecting to its presence. I was shouting all the slogans of the demonstration more than others, but I echoed in my heart my own slogan and one question to Spain, recalling what the Iraqi Ziryab gave her: Why do you give you music and give us shells? Why? He was chanting slogans and looking at the planes of huge sizes as dinosaurs. ""These planes have arrived To my country, I destroyed bridges, museums, gardens, schools and houses, and killed soldiers, some of whom were my friends, and children hiding with their mothers in the shelters. These planes bombed Baghdad and returned to land here in peace on the sea coast. ” Iraq, Palestine, Afghanistan, and ... and so decided to trace the word ""bombardment"" in life and books and in his conversation with his friend, to reflect the cognitive ability of sandy limping from one scene to another, and we have a tale inside the tale in the experimental game in the narrative in which the votes parallel to the event The main thing is to bomb and destroy Iraq. ""I saw everything as bombardment, advertisements, competitions programs, actor scandals, lovers' kisses and air infiltrated out of the window. Tearful .. Everything is pounding, exchanging pounding, exchanging looks, exchanging words / insults, yelling, tips, slapping, paternity, brotherhood, love, hatred, rape or making love, views ... etc "".


He had to bury the bodies that die under torture

Then comes the second section titled ""Happy Nights of Shelling"": shelling in my mother's room, the night of a laughing shelling, shelling and oblique justice, shelling and toilets, a life governed by life-long shelling, you and the camel are happy in the desert storm. Under these headlines the tragedy is mixed with comedy, atrocities with jokes and banter. Describes the lives of people in wartime, soldiers, small desires that may not exceed a cigarette or eliminate the need in the desert without a shell. In the novel ""The Gardens of the President"", we find war without exemplary improvements, far from the sense of humor that he resorted to in the ""happy nights of bombing,"" imagined that ironically will defeat the war that defeated everyone. The novel comes with all the events as it is atrocities committed by man in his fellow man, whether by war with neighboring countries or imprisonment and torture to the least suspicion of disloyalty to the ruler, even if the closest relatives, and methods of torture that the human mind does not believe. Ramli did not need to mitigate the occurrence of the killings and torture, or to beautify them and has been closely informed when the regime executed his brother artist and poet Hassan Mutlak in 1990 on charges of trying to overthrow the government, and considered Hassan Mutlak later ""Lorca Iraq, if he did not escape himself"" sandy ""to Spain may have been a new victim of the regime, and disappear like those who are"" Ibrahim ""enriched in his novel"" Gardens of the President. ""There was no need to resort to narrative tricks in The President's Gardens begin to beautify or mitigate his ugliness after the reality has exceeded the imagination. The President's Gardens begin with a scene of some irony despite his horror: in a country without bananas, the village woke up to nine banana boxes, each with a severed head for one of its sons. And with each head of his identity card that indicates it because some faces were completely distorted by previous torture to cut it, or because of the representation of After the slaughter, her features that she knew over the years of her life are no longer sufficient to indicate them. Then the events continue to end the novel scene itself. The novel took the form of a circular, it begins and ends with the same section, the scene of these banana boxes and cut heads contained by the opening of the sandy novel and then breed stories within the novel to paint the scene of bloody Iraq on its breadth and on various fronts. The novel tells the story of three members of the village who were brought together by friendship since childhood, Abdullah Kafka, Ibrahim Kassma, and Tariq Al-Mandhesh, names of each of which have the meaning of the character concerned. By following the events of their lives, we follow the history of Iraq itself, during the last half century, which has witnessed wars and devastation for both humans and the earth. The Iraqi-Iranian war, the invasion of Kuwait, the expulsion of the Iraqi army from Kuwait, the western blockade of Iraq, the bombing and shredding of sects and groups. All this from the perspective of man who finds himself a party to all this despite his nose. And then ends the absurd situation of a seat or a prisoner or chased by another party to change the name and agrees to master the methods of torture, there is no sanctity to the body or spirit under torture. Sandy elaborate on the description of the regime's atrocities and its systematic methods of torture, when the opportunity for one of the personalities Ibrahim ""to work in the gardens of the president, he thought it would be better because he soon became a circle supposed to be better off than other people, but he was surprised that his task was not to plant trees and flowers as he thought, but he had to bury the bodies that die under torture, in Continuous scenes infect the reader goose bumps surprised by the usual scenes of torture B and buried the bodies, to take the decision of Ibrahim to document these bodies in the records contain enough evidence and signs to know the owners if they found someone looking for them someday.


The fate of Iraq, which has become dependent on wars

We see the obvious difference between the ""happy nights of bombing"" and the ""gardens of the president"" in the narrative, but the fate of Iraq, which has become dependent on war alone. In both works, al-Ramli succeeded in choosing methods of narrative leaning on his basic idea that for half a century, the lives of ordinary people, wars, sieges, mass graves and the chaos of occupation have not changed, and Ibrahim's blood becomes a symbol of Iraqi blood, which separates one regime from another. It comes, between a war that ends and another begins, between enemies from the outside, and enemies from the inside .. And death is the destiny.
