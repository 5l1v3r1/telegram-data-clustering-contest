Every year since 2007, the Animation Council of the Philippines Inc. (Acpi) has been organizing a Philippine Animation Festival called “Animahenasyon.” On its 13th year, Animahenasyon is happening on November 8, 2019, at Samsung Hall, SM Aura.
The festival is a hot spot for Filipino original content in animation, while the accompanying competition attracts submissions from Filipino artists worldwide.
This year, Animahenasyon 13 celebrates that “Our Stories Matter,” Filipino culture is just as complex and multilayered as its people. Their stories and ideas can be developed into unique content that could propel the Philippine animation industry forward toward a future of locally produced films and TV series that connect with both local and global audiences.
The competition presents the opportunity for the animation community to discover new Filipino original content from both students and professionals. Attending the festival means being surrounded by talented and like-minded individuals. Everyone is brought together in a space where they can celebrate their love for animation, make meaningful connections and gain valuable insights from the guest speakers.
Animahenasyon will be bringing in Kitaro Kosaka, director of animated feature film Okko’s Inn, whose portfolio includes work at Studio Ghibli, MADHOUSE Productions, Oh! Productions and more; Mikki Crisostomo, a staff writer at Disney TV Animation and a graduate from University of the Philippines and Columbia University; Pancho Burgos-Goizueta, a film score composer who has worked on High-School Musical 2 and 3, Wheels, God’s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness, among several other films; and Carl Papa, an IT professional by day and a filmmaker at heart. His feature films, The Unforgetting and Manang Biring, have been recognized locally and internationally, while his most recent film, Paglisan, won best film at Cinema One Originals Film Festival.
There will also be free film screenings of Okko’s Inn by Kitaro Kosaka, Ars Electronica presents Young Animations curated by Sirikit Amann, Marona’s Fantastic Tale by Anca Damian, and Animahenasyon 13 Finalists will be available to all festival attendees.

Safo: The Mayor of the Rural Commune Guiro Traoré, in the hot seat
02 Nov 2019 by bamada.net


Guiro Traoré, mayor of the Rural Municipality of Safo, is accused of making double assignments on the plots of others.





Faced with the press last weekend, victims of the mayor of the Rural Municipality Safo, elected under the colors of MPR, vehemently denounced the unorthodox practices of the city's edile on the outskirts of Bamako. The mayor is suspected of engaging in dual powers, without warrants of the communal council on the plots of peaceful citizens.
His victims were numerous at the press conference held in the conference room of the multifunctional center ""Musso Kunda"" in Commune I of the district of Bamako. In the presidium, the debates were moderated by the former mayor of Safo, Moriba Traoré (1999-2009), now a public advisor to Safo.
According to him, the mayor is doing double attributions on other people's plots especially those given to the President Amadou Toumani Toure Republic to the Malians of the diaspora who had expressed the wish to return to the fold.
""It was the local authorities of Kati who, on the instructions of the president ATT, asked to find a place for the Malians of the diaspora and their choice fell on the Municipality of Safo. There we were able to give them 50 hectares. But to our surprise, we have been approached by the beneficiaries of these lands on the grounds that the town hall is selling these same parcels to other people and this without a mandate from the council, ""lamented the speaker, who insisted that some of the complainants have proof of their arguments. For him, it is time that force remains to the law in this file.
""Those who are giving these parcels are not on anyone's mission while the documents that these people (Malians of the Diaspora, Ed) have are not precarious titles,"" added the speaker.
This platform was the opportunity for the many victims to also denounce the speculations on the land reserves of more than 140 hectares and also on land titles of the populations on more than 1000 hectares in the localities of Falayan, Safo, Tassan, Zorokorô, Ouarala. ""Public spaces, even places reserved for mosques have not been spared by Mayor Guiro Traore,"" said a participant in the conference. This case is now a hot potato in the hands of Mayor Guiro Traoré, because the victims do not intend to let go and want justice to be done especially in these times of struggle against impunity and corruption.
