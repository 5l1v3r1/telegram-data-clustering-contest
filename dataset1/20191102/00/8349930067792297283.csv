Jojo Rabbit
02 Nov 2019 by Odile Tremblay
Coiffé du Prix du public au TIFF, Jojo Rabbit, de Taika Waititi, n’en est pas moins un film burlesque de catégorie B. S’attaquant au défi de proposer une satire sur la vie d’un jeune Allemand au cerveau lavé durant le IIIe Reich sur le mode pop, il est pétri de gags faciles et appuyés sur un scénario décousu, avec la figure tutélaire de Hitler (joué par le cinéaste) en grotesque ami imaginaire de l’enfant. La performance de jeune juive cachée, jouée avec finesse par Thomasin McKenzie, ne peut racheter cette poutine ambiguë et faussement hardie, usant maladroitement de vieilles recettes comiques sur un thème qui aurait réclamé du doigté et de la maîtrise.Notre critique complèteHoraire en salles

From the political transition to the constitutional transition: For a Fourth Republic in Mali, in the light of the multidimensional crisis
02 Nov 2019 by bamada.net
If the subject of constitutional and political transitions seems exhausted in French-speaking black Africa, the analysis of the Malian multidimensional crisis reveals that it still fuels the reflection of the African constitutionalists. They renew the legal-political debate on the interdependence of the constitutional transition and the political transition that should lead to the exercise of the constituent function. But what is the meaning of these two concepts so closely linked? Our contribution will try to explain it.






1-The national dialogue, an element of the political transition


If the political transition is logically accompanied by a constitutional transition, both have a different purpose. This is why the expression ""political transition"", in the light of the Malian multidimensional crisis, must be clarified, because it is a source of ambiguities in the debate between the defenders of the Third Republic and the proponents of the need for democracy. a Fourth Republic: it is a simple period of normalization of the regime in question which leads to a new political regime.
The Constitutional transition, on the other hand, tends to establish a new and lasting Constitution through recourse to original constituent power. It makes it possible to correct the limits of the Third Republic by establishing a real parliamentary system which appears as a desirable solution to the Malian multidimensional crisis. Therefore, the constitutional transition goes far beyond the political issue.
However, the political transition and the constitutional transition will have a specific importance during the reconstruction of a Malian state. We know that the adoption of a new Constitution is not enough to guarantee lasting stability, because the refoundation of a country effectively depends on the behavior of political actors. That said, the ongoing inclusive national dialogue is nothing but a manifestation of political transition, or even political-social reconciliation.


2-The Constitutional Transition, an Open Door to a Fourth Republic - and a Parliamentary System


Combining transition and consolidation is not enough to rebuild the state through constitutional law. This contribution wants to demonstrate that the political transition can not be the only way out of the crisis. However, with regard to the serious problems in Mali, we are not in favor of a total revision of the Constitution, as it could lead to an ""unconstitutional Constitution"".
For all these reasons, the idea of a Fourth Republic may seem chimerical, because, a priori, the advent of a new Republic does not imply de facto a real change in relations between institutions. The Fourth Republic, however, would settle imperfections in institutional practice and the relations between the different powers. The Third Republic of Mali is limited by its semi-presidential regime, often presented as a French-inspired regime, with particular characteristics: the President is elected by direct universal suffrage and has important powers granted to him by the Constitution; the government and its prime minister are accountable to the National Assembly. This is why the presidentialization of the regime is, in our opinion, a pathology, because under the Third Republic it was possible to witness a ""monarchical drift"" of institutions.
Obviously, this French model seems to be difficult to transpose in French-speaking Black Africa; it is necessary, in fact, to refound the Malian legal system on the basis of tradition and taking into accounteffects of globalization. The Third Republic is not in itself immutable, although it has been able to bring constitutional continuity for twenty-seven years. Two tracks can then be explored to build a Fourth Republic: the introduction of a strictly presidential regime, or that of a parliamentary type regime in Mali: the Prime Minister would have full powers, while the position of President of the Republic would be honorary.
