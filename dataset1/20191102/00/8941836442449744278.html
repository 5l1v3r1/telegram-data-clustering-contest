      <h1>Judge blocks Trump’s attempt to make immigrants prove they have</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T00:00:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/stephen-dinan/" target="_blank">Stephen Dinan</a></address>
      <p>A federal judge issued an order Saturday blocking President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s proclamation that would have ordered government screeners to refuse entry to would-be immigrants who can’t prove they have their own health insurance.</p>
      <p>Judge Michael Simon, an Obama appointee to the federal bench, said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a>’s Oct. 4 directive likely exceeds the boundaries of immigration law.</p>
      <p>He put a four-week hold on the policy to give himself more space to hear full legal arguments, but he made clear he thinks <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> went too far in his steps to try to prevent immigrants from becoming a public burden.</p>
      <p>“Congress has spoken directly to the circumstances in which an individual may be deemed to become a “financial burden” to the United States and has rejected the proclamation’s core premise,” the judge wrote.</p>

        <p>In addition to finding the thrust of the proclamation against the law, he also said the insurance standards the president set out are probably unworkable.</p>
