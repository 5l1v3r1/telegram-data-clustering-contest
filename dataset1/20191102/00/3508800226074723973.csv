攻守俱佳、深具潛力的中信兄弟「大物捕手」高宇杰
02 Nov 2019, 00:44 by 運動視界


我們想讓你知道的是本季高宇杰在攻守兩端的表現都有一號捕手的架勢，許多和他搭配的投手，都對高宇杰的配球技術讚譽有佳。至於高宇杰的拚勁，也是我對這名選手如此印象深刻的原因之一。



文：辰海
今年，終於看見中信兄弟的捕手開始有較固定的主戰一二號捕手，攻守均衡的黃鈞聲自然還是目前黃衫軍的主戰力，但隨著他也年過三十，中信兄弟的確需要尋覓下一個捕手，所以別忘了，那從東方冉冉升起的一顆新星，他就是高宇杰。
2014年還在平鎮高中的高宇杰，在參加黑豹旗被訪問時就提到自己從高中就很欣賞Lamigo的林泓育，同樣身為捕手，他也想朝著這個目標邁進。
而在2018年季中選秀會，兄弟用手上的二輪籤選進了這位大物捕手，那年兄弟的第一輪是選進現任守護神李振昌，而第三輪則是游擊手的未來江坤宇，也就是說，在球團心中那年捕手需求的優先性是大於游擊手的，22歲的他，被視為球隊未來的一號捕手絕非沒有道理。
獨立於守備光譜外的捕手，守備的難度自然不言而喻，更何況要衡量一位捕手的價值，絕非帳面上的守備率、打擊率就能看出，貴為球場上的指揮官。看管以及阻殺跑者的能力、配球的智慧乃至於擋球和拉好球的技巧，一名優秀的捕手不只能幫助球隊，更可以讓原本不起眼的投手大放異彩。
下半季中信兄弟的異軍突起，和高宇杰的竄起絕對脫不了關係，有許多和他搭配的投手，都對高宇杰的配球技術讚譽有佳，像是今年9/17才對富邦奪下首勝的紐維拉就認為高宇杰的引導很優秀，九月能奪下投手MVP，除了紐維拉自己狀況很好，與他搭配的高宇杰也功不可沒。

而下半季投出令人印象深刻的表現，同樣入選12強國手的廖乙忠，在本季四場的優質先發都是和高宇杰搭配的。在這四場比賽中廖乙忠投了27.1局僅掉4分，20次三振．沒有被敲全壘打，甚至在這其中兩場就是對總冠軍賽的對手Lamigo投出的。高宇杰曾說兩人從進職棒前就搭配過，在二軍也都一起搭檔，高宇杰認為現在的廖乙忠更有自己的想法，更敢放膽去投。
回憶起上半季時一軍捕手是由黃鈞聲和林明杰做輪替，但教練團實際上不太敢用林明杰，他的出場大多都是最後兩局或是偶爾一場先發，這也導致黃鈞聲大量的出場快速累積疲勞，幸好教練團在6/25終於想起高宇杰，而他首打席就擊出二壘安打也讓教練團對他信心大增。
自此後他大多會先發1～2場，或是在比賽後半捕手被代打後上來守備。8/25以前，高宇杰的打擊率幾乎都在三成以上，而且不時會有長打的演出。而到了球季末，黃鈞聲明顯因為疲勞狀態而不佳時，高宇杰適時頂上了捕手的空缺，不僅先發場次逐漸增加，在對比賽的解讀能力以及打擊上的表現也越來越出色，他對球隊的重要性早已不可同日而語。
我們來看看高宇杰和黃鈞聲兩位捕手的分項成績。

從表格可以看到，後期因為黃鈞聲疲勞後的表現不如季中時出色（7/21打擊率為0.291），所以兩人的打擊率稍稍有點落差，上壘率則是相去不遠，但看到長打率，就可以看出高宇杰的長打能力相當不錯，事實上在本季的27支安打中，就有9隻是長打（8隻二壘安打一發全壘打），除此之外，OPS+也來到以捕手來說相當夠水準的86.0。
雖然如此，高宇杰還是有著兩個缺點，一是選球不夠好，三振保送比是偏高的5.25，對比黃鈞聲的2.875來說遜色不少，好在隊上不乏選球好手，高宇杰可以就近觀察前輩們像是彭政閔、周思齊等人是如何去做好最基本的選球，來讓自己出色的打擊更加大放異彩。
再來，本季高宇杰面對左投打擊率僅有0.143，22個打席中更是吞下了9次三振，而在得點圈有人時面對右投打擊率高達0.353，對上左投確是一個大大的0。雖然樣本數很小，但如何增加自己對左投的打擊能力也是他這個球季結束後可以增進的課題之一。不過綜合來說，在打擊層面上，今年高宇杰的表現還是略勝一籌。
在本季最後一場出賽，高宇杰在總冠軍賽的前哨戰、球隊落後一分時逮中失投的紅中球一棒掃出左外野大牆，生涯首轟來的正是時候，不僅幫助球隊提升氣勢進而拿下比賽，也再次證明自己不僅僅有著長打能力，更是有成為捕手砲的潛力。

來到守備層面，老實說黃鈞聲的阻殺率已經相當夠水準，但高宇杰的阻殺率則到了誇張的0.6，即便今年的樣本數較小有失精準，可能無法直接說用帳面上的成績說服高宇杰是名防守優異的捕手，但透過以下的這兩部影片，不難看出高宇杰所擁有的超強臂力以及守備功力。






至於高宇杰的拚勁，也是我對這名選手如此印象深刻的原因之一，不論是義無反顧的用身體擋下無數顆提前挖地瓜的球，在無形之中幫球隊擋下不少分數，或是下面這個影片奮不顧身撲向護欄去接球，甚至接完球後第一個動作還是傳三壘，這樣的態度和精神，都讓我對這名年輕選手的未來有更高的期待。



今年如此精彩優異的表現，也為高宇杰爭取到了12強國手的門票，同為捕手出身的洪一中總教練也對他本季的表現相當滿意。對他來說，這次12強雖然可能不太會有上場的機會（我想首選還是林泓育和林祐樂），但相信有這次的國際賽經驗，除了能夠就近與總教練和隊友們學習，更能看看國外的球隊擁有什麼樣的特性以及如何去解讀比賽。22歲的他還有相當大的進步空間，他的天花板絕對不只如此。
在臥龍王峻杰奪下二軍冠軍後正式引退轉教練、過往曾經打出實績的陳家駒始終得不到教練團關愛，已經好久沒有上到一軍，吳明鴻今年在二軍表現不佳，在一二軍升降過程中，不難看出球隊有意讓高宇杰、林明杰兩位選手來爭奪目前球隊二號捕手的位置，林明杰身材相當高大，從進球隊後大家對他長打火力有著很高的期待，但先不論打擊成績始終不出色，他更大的問題是守備上的安定感始終不足。
相較之下，本季高宇杰在攻守兩端的表現都有一號捕手的架勢，甚至球季後半爭冠時期，教練團也大量讓他先發，尤其在擋球的部分高宇杰做得相當確實，常常能看見比賽中他是整個身體去檔提前落地的球，而不是只用手套去撈球。



也不曉得是有意無意，本季高宇杰102個打席數讓他明年還保有爭取新人王的資格，相較起今年沒有意外會被陳晨威拿下新人王寶座，來年若是高宇杰能複製今年的表現甚至更上一層樓，相信絕對有資格去和各家好手爭奪最佳新人獎，甚至成為中職歷史上第一位能拿下新人王的捕手。
假以時日，高宇杰有著更多經驗後，他在解讀比賽和配球的功力肯定會比現在更上一層樓，不難想像經過總冠軍賽和國際賽洗禮後的他，能逐漸扛起黃衫軍場上指揮官的重任，甚至成為中信兄弟下一個代表性的捕手。

The high-spirited and promising CITIC brothers ""big catcher"" Gao Yujie
02 Nov 2019, 00:44 by Sports Vision


What we want you to know is that Gao Yujie’s performance on both ends of the offense and defense has a number one catcher this season. Many of the pitchers who match him have a good reputation for Gao Yujie’s ball-matching skills. As for Gao Yujie's hard work, it is one of the reasons why I am so impressed with this player.



Text: Chen Hai
This year, I finally saw that the catchers of the CITIC brothers began to have a fixed main battle of the No. 1 and No. 2 catchers. The balance of the offensive and defensive Huang Haosheng is still the main force of the current Yellow Shirts, but as he is over 30 years old, CITIC brothers really need to find The next catcher, so don't forget, that is a rising star from the East, he is Gao Yujie.
Gao Yujie, who was still in Pingzhen High School in 2014, mentioned that he had appreciated Lamigo's Lin Yuyu from high school when he was interviewed. He also wanted to be a catcher. He also wanted to move toward this goal.
In the 2018 mid-season draft, the brothers were selected into the big catcher with a second-round pick. The first round of the brothers was selected as the current guardian Li Zhenchang, and the third round was the future of the shortstop Jiang Kunyu. That is to say, in the heart of the team, the priority of the catcher's demand is greater than that of the shortstop. At the age of 22, it is not unreasonable to be regarded as the team's future number one catcher.
Independent of the catcher outside the garrison spectrum, the difficulty of garrison is naturally self-evident, not to mention the value of a catcher. It is not the garrison rate and the strike rate on the book. It is the commander on the court. The ability to guard and stop the runner, the wisdom of the ball, and the skill of blocking the ball and pulling the ball, a good catcher can not only help the team, but also make the original inconspicuous pitcher shine.
In the second half of the season, the rise of CITIC Brothers and the rise of Gao Yujie are absolutely irrelevant. There are many pitchers who match him, and they all praise Gao Yujie's ball-matching technique. For example, it was the first time for Fubang to win the first 9/17 this year. Winner's Newvilla thinks that Gao Yujie's guidance is very good. In September, he can win the pitcher MVP. In addition to Newvilla's own situation, Gao Yujie, who is paired with him, also contributed.

In the second half of the season, the impressive performance of Liao Yizhong, who was also selected as one of the top 12 players, was matched with Gao Yujie in the four seasons. In these four games, Liao Yizhong voted 27.1 in only 4 points and 20 times. Not knocked home, even in these two games is the opponent of the championship game Lamigo. Gao Yujie once said that the two had been paired before the inauguration, and they also worked together in the Second Army. Gao Yujie believed that Liao Yizhong now has his own ideas and is more daring to vote.
Recalling that in the first half of the season, an army catcher was rotated by Huang Weisheng and Lin Mingjie, but the coaching team actually did not dare to use Lin Mingjie. Most of his appearances were the last two innings or occasional ones, which also led to a large number of Huang Weisheng. Excited to accumulate fatigue quickly, but fortunately the coaching team finally remembered Gao Yujie in 6/25, and his first shot hit the second base and also gave the coaching team confidence in him.
Since then, most of them will start with 1 or 2 games, or after the game, the catcher will be picked up and defended. Before 8/25, Gao Yujie's strike rate was almost 30%, and there will be long-term performances from time to time. At the end of the season, Huang Yusheng was obviously not good because of fatigue. Gao Yujie topped the vacancy of the catcher at the right time. Not only did the starting time increase gradually, but he also became more and more excellent in the ability to interpret the game and the performance of the attack. The importance of the team has long been different.
Let's take a look at the scores of the two catchers of Gao Yujie and Huang Yusheng.

As can be seen from the table, the performance after the fatigue of Huang Qisheng was not as good as that in the middle of the season (the 7/21 strike rate was 0.291), so the strike rate of the two men was slightly different, and the rate of the base was not far away, but they saw Long-term rate, you can see that Gao Yujie's long-playing ability is quite good. In fact, of the 27 hits in this season, 9 are only long-term hits (8 second bases hit a home run), in addition, OPS+ also Come to 86.0, which is quite adequate for the catcher.
Even so, Gao Yujie still has two shortcomings. First, the ball selection is not good enough. The strikeout ratio is 5.25, which is quite low compared to 2.875, which is better than the 2.75, but there is no shortage of players in the team. Gao Yujie can observe the seniors nearby. How do people like Peng Zhengyi and Zhou Siqi do the most basic ball selection to make their outstanding blows shine even more.
In addition, this season, Gao Yujie faced a left-handed strike rate of only 0.143, and in 22 of the seats, he swallowed 9 strikeouts. When he was in a circle, he faced a right-handed strike rate of 0.353. Is a big 0. Although the sample size is small, how to increase his ability to strike the left shot is one of the topics that he can improve after the end of the season. However, on the whole, on the combat level, Gao Yujie’s performance this year is still slightly better.
In the final game of this season, Gao Yujie’s outpost in the championship game, when the team fell behind by one point, caught the missed shot of the red ball and swept out the left field wall. The first time of the career came, not only helped the ball. The team improved its momentum and won the game. It also proved that it not only has the ability to play long, but also has the potential to become a catcher.

Coming to the defensive level, I honestly said that the blocking rate of Huang Qisheng is quite adequate, but Gao Yujie’s blocking rate has reached an exaggerated 0.6. Even if the sample size this year is small and accurate, it may not be possible to directly use the results on the book to persuade. Gao Yujie is a defensive catcher, but through the following two films, it is not difficult to see the high arm and defensive skills that Gao Yujie has.






As for Gao Yujie's hard work, it is one of the reasons why I am so impressed with this player. Whether it is the unrelenting use of the body to block countless balls that dig the sweet potato in advance, in the invisible help the team to block a lot of points, or It is the following film that flutters to the guardrail to catch the ball, and even the first action after the ball is passed or the third base. This attitude and spirit make me have higher expectations for the future of this young player.



This year's wonderful performance has also won Gao Yujie's tickets to the top 12 national players. Hong Yizhong, the head coach of the same catcher, is also quite satisfied with his performance this season. For him, although the top 12 may not have the opportunity to play (I think Lin Yuyu and Lin Youle are preferred), but I believe that this international experience, in addition to being able to learn from the head coach and teammates, Can look at the characteristics of foreign teams and how to interpret the game. At the age of 22, he still has considerable room for improvement, and his ceiling is definitely not only that.
After Wolong Wang Junjie won the second army championship and officially retired from the coach, Chen Jiaxuan, who had made achievements in the past, has never been cared for by the coaching staff. He has not been in the army for a long time. Wu Minghong did not perform well in the Second Army this year. It is not difficult to see that the team intends to let Gao Yujie and Lin Mingjie compete for the position of the current team's No. 2 catcher. Lin Mingjie is quite tall. After entering the team, everyone has high expectations for his long fire, but no matter what. The hit scores have not always been outstanding. His bigger problem is that the sense of stability on the defensive is always insufficient.
In contrast, Gao Yujie's performance on both ends of the offense and defense has the number one catcher's posture. Even during the second half of the season, the coaching team also let him start a lot, especially in the part of the ball blocking Gao Yujie did quite well, often I can see that he is the whole body to go to the ball in advance in the game, instead of just using gloves to catch the ball.



I don't know if it is intentional or not. This season, Gao Yujie's 102 seats will keep him qualified for the newcomer next year. Compared with this year, Chen Chenwei won the newcomer's throne compared to this year. If Gao Yujie can replicate this year's performance in the coming year. Even higher, I believe that I am absolutely qualified to compete with the best players for the best newcomer award, and even become the first catcher in the history of secondary vocational school to win the newcomer.
In time, after Gao Yujie has more experience, his skill in interpreting the game and the ball will definitely be higher than now. It is not difficult to imagine that after the championship and international baptism, he can gradually pick up the yellow shirt. The commander’s responsibility has even become the next representative catcher of CITIC Brothers.
