      <p>TEXARKANA, Ark. (AP) - A new attorney has been appointed for a southwest Arkansas doctor and his trial is being delayed on charges of overprescribing opiates and other drugs.</p>
      <p>Court records first reported by the Texarkana Gazette show the trial of 54-year-old Lonnie Joseph Parker was postponed on Wednesday from Nov. 20 until April 13.</p>
      <p>The delay was requested by new defense attorney John Wesley Hall, who was named as Parker’s defense attorney on Oct. 24.</p>
      <p>Parker has pleaded not guilty to nine counts of prescribing without a legitimate medical purpose. An indictment says he prescribed about 1.2 million dosages of opiates approximately 16 gallons of cough syrup during a two year period.</p>

        <p>Parker was convicted in 2000 of possessing child pornography and served more than four years in prison. The state Medical Board reinstated his license in 2015.</p>
