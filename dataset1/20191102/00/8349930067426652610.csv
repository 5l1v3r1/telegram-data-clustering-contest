Sirafily Diango Malian writer: ""It's hard to write if you do not like men""
02 Nov 2019 by bamada.net


Professor of letters, Sirafily Diango is one of those who bring Malian literature and culture to life. A graduate of the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Bamako (Ensup), Professor Diango is a prolific writer with ten books to his credit, including the ""Nouvelles du Mali"" (a collective), ""The traveler writing"" and ""It's raining"" on northern Mali "". A well-respected playwright and comedian, he directs the theater company ""Destins Croisés"". He is also in charge of the theatrical troupe of Lycée Massa Makan Diabaté. We went to meet him.





Today-Mali: Hello can you present us your book ""Traveling Writer""?
Sirafily Diango: ""Traveling Traveler"", as his title may suggest, is an African travelogue in Europe, especially in Germany. It is to see Europe through the eyes of a clandestine emigrant. It is a letter written throughout the trip. He sees and tells to his friend his romantic thoughts and romantic memories and hopes for a better world. Beyond the trip, he tells all that he has lived in Europe.


What do you want to teach readers through the conversation between the fool and the drunkard in ""Traveler Writing""?


The madman and the drunkard are two emblematic characters. The madman is not in possession of his mental faculties and the drunkard does not enjoy his lucidity. The fool takes precedence over the drunkard. There is in this book a character who says ""I'd rather be crazy than being a drunkard than being a fool"". Here the character of the fool attracts me a lot by what I associate with the artistic creation. We can not create without madness. Behind the great works, there is always a dose of madness.





You also magnify the joking cousin in this book ...


Through this passage, I think of our societal values. I'm Malinké and I tickle a little my cousins Sarakolé. It is a look at our values, including the value of joking cousins that, beyond mere joking, is really one of the few values that remain to us. The joking cousin, for me, is a valve to the civil war in Mali. Many things are resolved through this value that we must safeguard at all costs.


Can you tell us a bit about your book ""It's raining over northern Mali""?


""It's raining on the north of Mali"" is a play that was born from the observation of a sad reality of our country. For more than twenty (20) years the management of the northern crisis by successive governments has been limited to half measures, palliatives and compromises instead of concrete, relevant and effective actions. Yet previous regimes in one way or another had curbed this crisis. I think that the catastrophic management of the northern crisis has catapulted the country into the pit of armed rebellion hardened by the occupation of half of the country by the insane gods of jihad and sharia.
This play is a text of circumstance. This is the result of the observation of a laxity present at all levels and culminated in the March 2012 coup. This book is both a reaction against the behavior of the Malian system and all Malians because we are all guilty of everything in this crisis.


What are the difficulties you face in your writing career?


There is my teacher Moussa Konaté, who is an excellent writer, who went into exile in France. He often asks me how do I write here? Because it is really difficult to focus on writing in our environmental environment, writing is a solitary activity because to write, you have to isolate yourself. Most of the time, I wrote my texts when my wife and children slept and when I did not have this opportunity I locked myself in.years in the school library to write.


Do you have a message for young Malian writers?



Today, many young people say that it is difficult to write. Even if this is true, to learn to swim you have to jump into the water. We must start first and as they will produce good texts. André Gide said that everyone can become a writer because everyone can write at least one page each day and if you write a page every day, you will have at least the bad novel of three hundred and sixty-five (365) pages. To write, you have to read and love. It's hard to write if you do not like men. We must love men and accept the opinion of others.


Tell us about your latest book ""Victor Sy, the supreme fighter""!


This book was born from the project ""Transcribe the memory of our society"" which consists in writing about the life of an emblematic personage of the country. And my first choice fell on Victor Sy, a man who has been in all the living pages of Mali's history. Victor Sy has been my teacher in the past, but I was very impressed. This book tells the story of a man engaged on all levels in Mali. He did a lot for the emergence of Malian youth.


Do you have writing projects?


Yes, for the moment, I continue with the Sahelian project with two other works in project. The first book is entitled ""Issa N'Diaye, between myth and reality"". Professor Issa N'Diaye is a great person in the political history of Mali. The second work is ""Diama Cissouma, diamond iron"". Diama is Professor of Geography at the Ecole normale supérieure of Bamako (Ensup). She has been Director of the Teaching Academy of the Right Bank for several years. She is a lady whose life deserves to be taught. I also planned a novel entitled ""The drift of Hèrèmakono"" which speaks of the story of sharing inheritance between three brothers. He will soon be on the market.
