Vojvodina najčešće sapliće večite
Pisali smo pre dva dana o statistici koja kaže da Vojvodina najviše bodova otkida Partizanu i Crvenoj zvezdi. Imajući to u obzir crno-bele čeka vrlo težak posao, pogotovo ako se zna da je novosadska Stara dama ove sezone najbolji gost Superlige.

NE IGRA NIKOLIĆ, MATIĆ VODI NAPAD VOJVODINE
Što se tiče Vojvodine, najbitniju promenu u odnosu na duel vanredne runde sa Inđijom trener Nenad Lalatović napravio je u špicu. Nema u prvih 11 strelca odlučujućeg gola na tom meču, Nemanje Nikolića, umesto pozajmljenog Partizanovog špica počeće Bojan Matić, a zanimljivo je da je u odnosu na najavljeni sastav šansu umesto Mirka Topića dobio na mestu zadnjeg veznog Marko Đurišić.
Sastav Vojvodine: Rockov – Veselinović, Đurić, Saničanin, Devetak – Drinčić, Đurišić – Đuričin, Bojić, Eze – Matić.

Na klupu su se preselili Sejduba Suma i Zoran Tošić, a priliku u prvih 11 dobili su Aleksandar Šćekić – što znači da će Bibras Natho biti organizator igre umesto Gvinejca – i mlađani Filip Stevanović.
Ekipa Partizana: Stojković – Miletić, Ostojić, Pavlović, Urošević – Zdjelar, Šćekić – F. Stevanović, Natho, Asano – Sadik.
