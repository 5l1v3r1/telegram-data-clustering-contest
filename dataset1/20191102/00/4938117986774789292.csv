Coin on car door: A new method of car theft
02 Nov 2019 by Lev Shamshin

Between car owners and fraudsters there is a constant struggle for property and for every new effective way of security, attackers find ways to get around it. One of the most popular ways in recent times has been a coin on the door of the vehicle.






Coin on the handle of a car. The coin trick is very simple but effective. For example, it is placed under the door handle, and the owner does not even notice that something is wrong with the machine. It works quite simply:

Coin does not allow the lock to close completely
In this case, a characteristic alarm signal may be triggered.
Car owners usually don’t notice a foreign object at all
Attackers gain access to the cabin and can easily steal a car

It is noteworthy that due to the sound signal, as if the car was closing, the drivers calmly leave and leave their property. According to experts, there are no effective measures against such methods, because even the most modern security systems and motion sensors or the latest alarms do not help.






Ways to secure property. In view of the existing threats, the only way to protect yourself and your car is to be careful, especially when the owner of the vehicle leaves him for a long time. When leaving the car, it is enough to examine the door handles and the places around them. If there are even faint scratches there, it is worth worrying.
Having closed the doors, it will not be superfluous to check them manually, to twitch. Even if there are no intruders nearby, you can quickly identify damage to the door handles.
Another effective method is to close all the doors from the passenger compartment, and upon exiting - the driver’s door. Moreover, it is better to use an old proven regular key. Then the way to steal a coin simply does not work out.
The opinion of experts. Although experienced motorists call such hijacking methods not very effective, experts believe that fraudsters still use coins, but for other purposes. Drivers note that the alarm or security system will not work if one of the doors is not closed, and therefore only an absent-minded or inattentive driver can leave the car open.
Experts note that the coin under the door handle helps the tricksters to figure out orphaned cars. For example, if the owner leaves the car in the parking lot and there is enough time for theft, most likely, the attackers will take advantage of this.
Total. Among scammers, a new easy way to steal vehicles has appeared. For this, they use an ordinary coin, which is placed under the car door. Nevertheless, experienced drivers believe that such a method cannot work, unless the owner of the vehicle is too dispersed.
Experts believe that a coin under the handle of a car helps attackers to figure out ownerless cars that they leave, for example, in parking lots.
