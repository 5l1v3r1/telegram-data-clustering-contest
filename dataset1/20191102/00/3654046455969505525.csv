Mahdi's Departure, Elections Unlikely to Fix Iraq's Economic, Political System - Experts

02 Nov 2019, 00:04


MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Experts shared their views that Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi's resignation is unlikely to cardinally change the situation in the protest-hit country because elections and a ""change of faces"" in power cannot resolve core problems inherent in the very economic and political system of the Middle Eastern nation.

Amid weeks-long anti-government protests, Iraqi President Barham Salih said on Thursday that Mahdi agreed to resign once a replacement was found. The Iraqi leader also vowed to hold a snap election after a new election law was enacted.
The news came after influential Shiite politician Muqtada Sadr, one of the leaders of the Sairoon parliamentary bloc, pushed for a no-confidence vote in the government, joining protests. Meanwhile, it was him and his rival Hadi Amiri, the leader of the Iran-backed Badr Organisation, who agreed on Mahdi as a compromise figure for prime minister a year ago.
Yet, in early October, a year after the current government took office following the May elections, rallies started across the country. People demand the ouster of the cabinet, as well as economic reforms, better living conditions, social welfare and an end to corruption. Protests quickly turned violent, leaving more than 250 people killed and hundreds more injured.
No Quick Fixes Exist
Experts agree that one should not expect that the prime minister's resignation would bring about any fundamental change since the root cause of the instability is the country's economy, coupled with the flawed political system.
""The resignation of the Prime Minister is unlikely to reverse the situation, as the whole economic and political system is rotten with no prospect of meaningful improvement"", Rodney Wilson, an emeritus professor of economics at Durham University, said.
The economy, the expert says, ""continues to be mismanaged"" while ""the standard of living for the majority of the population has continued to decline"", despite Iraq's enormous oil reserves.
""Much oil revenue is corruptly appropriated and inequalities are becoming worse … Unemployment remains high, and many aspire to jobs in the public sector which are usually allocated on the basis of political connections and tribal loyalties"", Wilson explained.
An election early in 2020, according to him, ""may bring a change of faces"" but is unlikely to result in policy changes as the economic problems are fundamental and ""there are no quick fixes"". The expert also noted that it was unclear what normalisation could mean in an Iraqi context, stressing that the country had moved ""from crisis to crisis"" since independence.

Zenonas Tziarras, a researcher at the PRIO Cyprus Center, similarly believes that Mahdi's resignation is an attempt to appease the masses but in reality, could calm them only for the time being.
""If the post-Mahdi political order does not deliver what the people are protesting for (e.g. constitutional amendments, impartial elections, eradication of corruption, employment and proper public services), demonstrations and political violence is likely to persist"", he said.
Implications for Iran Influence
Another aspect of the current instability in Iraq is the consequences it will have on Shiite Iran's influence in the country.
According to Tziarras, the political turmoil and snap elections could weaken pro-Iranian/Shiite powers, such as the Badr Organisation led by Amiri, which makes Tehran interested in the country maintaining the political status quo.
""By extension, this would also mean that the Shiite militia groups of the Popular Mobilisation Unites (PMU) could also face the scenario of dissolution, which would be a great blow to Iran's foothold in Iraq. For these reasons, we should that Iran and the shiite forces in Iraq will go at great lengths to preserve the status quo"", he suggested.
Wilson agreed that ""the protests are unwelcome in Iran which has enough problems itself resulting from United States sanctions"", doubting, however, that Iran's influence would be undermined.
The expert explained that religious affiliation matters were very important in the region, with all players accepting that. After all, he stressed, the protests in Iraq and Lebanon are ""against the two Arab governments, and not Iran"".

The CDU after the Thuringia election death fight or comforting wallowing of the Union
The election result of Thuringia as a ""victory of the edges"" to interpret how parts of the CDU do it, is blinded by reality, lazy and without any sense for the voters, comments Joachim Frank. The attacks of Friedrich Merz on the own party leadership turn help only the AfD.
02 Nov 2019 by Joachim Frank
Once upon a time there was a politician who promised great things to his own people: he dared to halve the election results of the AfD and thus help the CDU regain its old strength. Nevertheless, at the party convention a year ago, not Friedrich Merz was elected party chairman, but Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.
Merz serves success strategy of the AfD
What Merz did after the Thuringia election last Sunday could be summed up in one word: Etsch! Because a European election and four state elections later not only Merz must state: With the exception of Bremen, the Union has done worse everywhere than four or five years ago. The AfD is on a seemingly unstoppable high. Would the CDU delegates have better follow the call from the Sauerland in 2018 and recommend Merz to the CDU chairmanship?
His performance in recent days does not speak for it. Because the attacks on the Chancellor, on the Grand Coalition in Berlin and, of course, on the incumbent CDU leadership, which bears the government alliance - these attacks served exemplary a success strategy of the AfD: The established parties as exhausted, exhausted, quarrelsome and to denounce civilians.
Merz criticism from his own party
Instead of asking after the election in Thuringia, what could be good for the country and what constructive role the CDU could play as a loser, Merz went on his old favorite enemy Angela Merkel. ""The attacks made were politically mindless as well as excessive in style and content,"" complained a group of CDU parliamentarians. Under the leadership of foreign minister Norbert Röttgen, the deputies in a statement insist on ""concrete work"", with which they ""responsibly fulfill their mandate"". This is a clear allusion to the fact that Merz has escaped the concrete work. European election campaign for the CDU? Not my thing!
Merz, it is well known, can react with extreme harshness to the interpretation that he is still dealing with the settlement of his open bill with Merkel, who in 2002 - after the lost general election - ousted him from the parliamentary group chair. But this interpretation is inevitable if the election result of Sunday, which was a slap in the office of liberal democracy, only to the powder keg, to which Merz can lay his party and personnel policy fancy, and if then also the years of politics -Abstinente Roland Koch emerges as a political zombie from the crypt of anti-Merkelianer.
Without any sense for the voters
In the discussion of the last few days there had been ""no single substantial contribution to the renewal of the CDU"", so the criticism of the group around Norbert Röttgen. And: ""The behavior of individuals was extremely harmful to the CDU and self-destructive."" That's the situation. And it does not get better by trying to interpret the election result of Thuringia as a ""victory of the margins"" - left and right.
As if the local Left Party under Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow after the old horseshoe theory of an ideological touch of the extremes somehow belonged to the Björn-Höcke-AfD. This is not only blind to reality, but also lazy and - again - without any sense for the voters who have made Ramelow's party in Thuringia the strongest force; Mind you, after five years in government.
Old politics geography is outdated
During this time in Thuringia neither the Communist Manifesto replaced the constitution of the Land, nor the planned economy was introduced or private property abolished. Nonetheless, CDU General Secretary Paul Ziemiak has been cautious in his consideration of any kind of cooperation with Ramelow, placing the Left Party as a troop of anti-democrats, anti-Semites, anarchists and opponents of the rule of law.
This is so annoying, because it testifies to a self-certainty, even self-glaring, to which just the CDU has no more reason. In 2019 one can no longer continue the old political geography of the center and the margins. It is more than 20 years ago that Tony Blair in the UK and then Gerhard Schröder in Germany spent the slogan of the ""New Center"". For the SPD, Schröder wanted to challenge the Union for the place in the social center, which the Union, with all the overweight gaiety of the Helmut Kohl era, regarded as her hereditary court.
The CDU in the footsteps of the SPD
To-day, insistence on this understanding of the Middle applies the bitterly sarcastic word of Friedrich Nietzsche: ""We put our chair in the middle ... and as far away from dying fighters as from cheerful sows."" But that is - mediocrity: whether it is moderation . "" As far as Nietzsche. From death struggle or comforting wallowing as a description of the state neither the CDU nor the SPD will want to hear something. But you should say so.
