Anchor Christmas 2019Erin Conger

Anchor Brewing Company announced the release of its 2019 Christmas Ale this week, marking the 45th year the beer has been available.“We are committed to preserving Anchor Christmas Ale’s signature style while adding new ingredients to enhance this annual delicacy. Slightly darker than last year’s Christmas Ale, the 2019 edition is layered with toasted caramel and coffee flavors with subtle hints of Mexican chocolate, rounded out with herbaceous spices. Crack open a bottle for a spiced whiff of western evergreens, roasted malts and coastal flowers,” shared Anchor Brewmaster, Scott Ungermann.
 “It’s a rich, round and full bodied-treat with a silky, smooth finish. Christmas Ale is best served in a big open glass at a table full of family and friends.” 
45 years ago Anchor released the very first holiday beer in America since Prohibition. Each year it relives that tradition by once again brewing the spiced beer, which gets a new, hand-drawn label each year.
This year’s label was illustrated by Jim Stitt, who has illustrated the labels every year since 1975.
Those spices in the beer also evolve over time, which makes the beer exceptionally popular or side by side tastings. While this year and last year’s beers are technically the same, they’ll taste very different when consumed side by side today.
“People love to align past Christmas Ale styles in vertical tastings,” said Ungermann. “An added bonus of this holiday tradition is that the beer can age gracefully for years to come.”  
The beer has a 6.9% ABV and will be available between now and mid-January.

Support women's resilience, one drop at a time

In sub-Saharan Africa, up to 80% of food is produced by women. When climate change has a real impact, we can understand that women are on the front line. In Senegal, a project seeks to give them tools to adapt to these new challenges. The lands in the Niayes Strip, in northwestern Senegal, have always been fertile. In the 1990s, you could have access to water by digging to a depth of one or two meters. Today, the reality is quite different: ""Because of the overexploitation of water and climate change, surface water is increasingly scarce,"" says Babacar Samb, program manager and representative in Senegal for the International Crossroads. To draw water, it is necessary to dig into the water table up to 20 meters deep, a possibility much more difficult to access for women. ""Women are resourceful,"" explains Mr.Samb. Some, more resilient, had continued to produce with potable water, but the cost was becoming extremely high. ""

Unequal access

Despite their importance in food production both for their own household and for sale in local markets, ""Senegalese women are disadvantaged in their access to land,"" says the program manager. Faced with increasingly difficult access to water, they do not have the leisure to turn to another land, as men do. A phenomenon that leads since 2015 to the abandonment of certain lands. ""There is also discrimination in access to information. They end up having less knowledge and financial, technical and technological means at their disposal, ""he continues.
It is to meet these glaring needs that the Drop by Drop project was launched in December 2018, funded by the Quebec Ministry of the Environment's Green Fund of $ 730,000 and supported by the Network of Farmers' Organizations. Pastoralist of Senegal (RESOPP), the local partner. This Crossroads initiative is aimed at women from two communities in the Niayes region, Cherif Lô and Pambal. Trainings, setting up of field-schools, development of infrastructures for the irrigation of the grounds and the storage of harvests are being implemented thanks to this project which is spread over 28 months.

Demultiplication of knowledge

The groups were first mobilized; 18 women from these groups have been trained in market gardening techniques and agroecology, which among other things, know which type of plantation will be more resistant to climate change. Canadian experts have lent their support to the trainings, ""but we also want to train Senegalese experts to build local capacities,"" says Samb. Back in their communities, these women themselves become trainers and multiply their knowledge with groups, bringing the number of women affected to 633. In total, Drop by Drop wants to reach 1500 women through the establishment of training structures. management and development of market gardening perimeters.
In addition to supporting women in their knowledge, the Drip project provides for the establishment of several structures that will improve access to water: drilling wells, building a water tower, setting up a drip irrigation system with solar energy on 11 sites. ""Irrigated production will start after the installation of the facilities,"" says the International Crossroads, but 450 plants of Moringa, a small, fast-growing tree more resistant to drought, have already been planted.

Income diversification

The implementation of the irrigation system and the construction of storage warehouses has a direct impact on these women. Thus, market gardening drip will make possible the cultivation of new plants such as potatoes, okra, sweet and bitter eggplant, as well as fruit growing (mango, lemon). In addition to helping to better meet the nutritional needs of women and their families, this diversification gives them access to major distributors' markets to sell their produce. ""Thanks to the storage store, we will be able to generate more revenue,"" explains Ramata Faye, President of the RESOPP Women's Dynamics and project beneficiary.
""Ten years ago, women did not do small business; now we are entrepreneurs, ""says the participant. A very practical way of valuing women's work, rarely appreciated and paid for.
