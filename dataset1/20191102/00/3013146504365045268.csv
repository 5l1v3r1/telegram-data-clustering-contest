Left looks to own all three branches of government in 2020
02 Nov 2019 by Robert Knight

ANALYSIS/OPINION:

For more than 240 years, America’s Christian culture and its continued influence have combined with limits on government imposed by the U.S. Constitution to make the United States the freest, most prosperous nation in history.  
We overcame slavery, Jim Crow and won two world wars and the Cold War. Americans have given trillions in aid to afflicted areas around the globe. America was founded by Christians who believed that God had given them an unprecedented chance to fashion a country where “We the People” govern instead of a king. In fact, one of the rallying cries during the American Revolution was “No king but King Jesus.”
But forces have been at work for decades to “liberate” us from our self-governed republic. Marxists have specifically targeted cultural foundations without which we cannot maintain our republic. These are faith, family and the free market, which are supported by the freedoms of religion, speech, assembly and the press, property rights and due process.  
The left is licking its chops at the prospect of taking over all three federal branches of government in 2020 and/or removing President Trump from office over a misreported phone call to a foreign leader.  
Fresh from their secret briefing room, Nancy Pelosi’s House Democrats voted on Halloween to approve rules of a formal impeachment inquiry. But they can’t pretend it’s bipartisan, since no Republican voted with them. If this doesn’t work, they’ll cook up something else.


They sound sane at times, but don’t be fooled. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for instance, described herself in 2018 as a “capitalist to my bones.” 
But the Massachusetts Democrat, who once falsely identified as a Native American, wants a federal takeover of corporations and health care, just for starters. Her version of the Green New Deal, which she unveiled in September, calls for repealing the Trump tax cuts and hitting up the 1 percent to pay for phasing out fossil fuels entirely by 2035.  
That’s right. Just as America has achieved energy independence, she wants us to count on solar panels, windmills and perhaps millions of hamsters in tiny wheels attached to generators.  
Where is PETA when you need them? Just to make it clear, I’m joking about the hamsters. I think she prefers gerbils.

In October, Ms. Warren began railing against charter schools because they compete with government schools.  
Her plan, “A Great Public School Education for Every Student,” calls for banning for-profit charter schools, plus deploying the IRS to investigate nonprofit charters that may “actually serve for-profit interests.” For a self-declared capitalist, she sure hates the concept of profits.
“We should stop the diversion of public dollars from traditional public schools through vouchers or tuition tax credits,” she said.
Translation: There will be no escape from leftist indoctrination. If you Christian and orthodox Jewish parents, in particular, think that you can keep your children safe by home schooling or putting them in a private school, you’re whistling past the graveyard. If she gets her way, it’s only a matter of time before everybody’s children are enrolled in Miss Lizzie’s New Age School of Bliss.
In Ray Bradbury’s haunting 1953 novel “Fahrenheit 451,” a totalitarian regime has burned all the books, leaving a small band of freedom lovers who memorize the great works to keep them alive. 
Today’s book burners are not the parents and school board members who protest when schools ply children with perverse and obscene texts. The real burners are the legions of the left who have declared all dissent to be the equivalent of “hate speech” or “racism.” 
The ultimate goal of progressives like Ms. Warren is to replace self-government with an all-powerful socialist state to supplant and suppress Christian morality and dictate how we all live and what we’re allowed to say.  
Eventually, they’d dictate who could buy and sell. We already have a model of this in Communist China, whose “social credit” system rates citizens according to their ideological compliance with the regime. Depending on the score, people are either allowed to travel and access services — including medical care — or prevented from doing so. 
This is chilling to anyone familiar with the Mark of the Beast foreseen in Revelation 13:16-18.   
If you don’t think it can happen here, you might check out the growing list of people facing fines, loss of job or even jail for refusing to go along with the LGBTQ agenda or climate change hysteria.   
Cultural elites have bought into socialism as the road to utopia, and they mean to impose it on the United States. This poisonous doctrine has already weakened much of Europe. 
But there is one problem for them: The American people, and specifically, voting-eligible citizens. Even after decades of media and educational propaganda falsely denigrating America as uniquely evil, millions of Americans still love our country and stubbornly resist the siren song of socialism.  
The left has captured much of the culture, the media, education, the entertainment industry and even large corporations. They long to conquer the place where people can voice their contrary political opinions directly — the ballot box. 
This week in Virginia, and next year all over the United States, let’s disappoint them.

Mission Party - Everyone, Everything, and Always on Mission

02 Nov 2019

On the 27th, the annual Missionary Feast took place at Fr. Dehon Missionary Seminary. A large number of friends, collaborators, and benefactors of the missions passed through the compound and made this day special; I leave you some of the shares that came to us. Let us keep the missionary's flame burning.
“Feast of the Missions - Day of prayer, sharing and conviviality! We started with the opening of the missionary fundraising fair to satisfy the neediest.
This was followed by the celebration of Mass, presided by D. Manuel Linda, Bishop of Porto and president of the Mission and New Evangelization Commission, for the nourishment of the soul. After lunch, there was a recreational afternoon for body food and fraternal conviviality among all participants. The success of this celebration was due to the spirit and willingness to share, joy and good mood of all groups, under the coordination of Fr. Igor Oliveira. ”Maria Assunção Aguiar - Vila Boa de Quires Missionary Group
“The missionary celebration took place with great enthusiasm, joy, in the spirit of true missionaries. Everyone felt united and joined efforts to make this party a success, through various forms of sharing such as offers / sales of products, lunch, animation and auction very well prepared. The Eucharist, presided by our bishop D. Manuel Linda, was the highlight of this missionary celebration. From there we left excited and impelled to continue as baptized and sent. ”Álvaro Pinto, Rio de Galinhas Missionary Group
“The feast of the missions last Sunday, October 27th, was, in my view, very positive, since the Eucharist lived with a lot of charism of faith in which the phrase of Bishop D. Manuel Linda was“ we cannot be people of wait for them to serve us, but we must serve because that makes us great missionaries ”; It was visibly a high moment of our day. Turning to the recreational part, a lot of excitement and a lot of joy, because it is also very important in this party, people feel happy. The sales have always been very successful and a lot of adherence from both sales leads and buying… well be those who dedicated themselves and made this party a day full of emotions. ”Linda Silva, Cristelo Missionary Group
“The last Sunday of October was the chosen day for the Northern Dehonian to celebrate the 2019 Feast of Missions. For World Mission Day 20-10, we joined Fatima with the whole Church in Portugal at the close of the Extraordinary Missionary Year. The Feast took place in the surroundings of Father Dehon Missionary Seminary (Portelinha-Rio Tinto) with our Bishop, Manuel Linda, presiding at the Eucharist, concelebrated by several Dehonian priests, including the Provincial Superior, Fr. José Agostinho F Sousa, the head of the Dehonian missionary activity, Fr. Igor Oliveira and the Superior of the Seminary, Fr. Antonio Loureiro and the priests Antonino Sousa and Julio Carrara, members of the local religious community. There were several hundred Friends of the Missions, including members of the various mission groups, former students of the SMPD and in any case belonging to the Dehonian Family. After prayer, we went to the lunch table, taken in the cafeterias or in the outdoor gardens. Then the afternoon of socializing continued in the shadow of a large tent set up on the football field. There were the stands where funds were raised for the benefit of the Missions, where various entertainment groups performed: dance, singing and the well-appreciated performance of the guest artist, Adelaide Ferreira. In the end, happy to be able to help those most in need together, we were still toasted by the firework effect with the 5 colors (green, red, white, blue and yellow) allusive to the 5 continents where the men and women of our world live. time. ALL, EVERYTHING AND ALWAYS IN MISSION in praise of God and for the welfare of every human being. ”Br. Jose Camacho scj
“The Association ofs Former Students of Missionary Seminary Fr. Dehon comes to share and express the joy of once again participating in this great event, the Feast of the Missions. This year, and as in other previous years, his participation was with the Armindo restaurant, which this year went very well. The Association wants to express to the whole team of the Missions, that the day was magnificent, was very well and they can count on us whenever necessary. A good regards to all who are part of this Dehonian Family. ”Manuel Morais, AAASMPD
