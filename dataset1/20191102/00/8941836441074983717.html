      <h1>Airbnb CEO says company is banning “party houses”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T00:00:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">DEE-ANN DURBIN</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/airbnb-inc/">Airbnb Inc.</a> says it’s banning “party houses” in the wake of a deadly shooting at an <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/airbnb-inc/">Airbnb</a> rental in California.</p>
      <p>In a series of tweets Saturday, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/airbnb-inc/">Airbnb</a> co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brian-chesky/">Brian Chesky</a> said that the San Francisco-based company is stepping up efforts to “combat unauthorized parties and get rid of abusive host and guest conduct.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brian-chesky/">Chesky</a> said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/airbnb-inc/">Airbnb</a> is expanding manual screening of “high risk” reservations that are flagged by its system. It’s also forming a rapid response team dedicated to house parties.</p>
      <p>The company will remove guests who fail to comply, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brian-chesky/">Chesky</a> said.</p>
      <p>Five people were killed in a Halloween party shooting in the San Francisco suburb of Orinda.</p>

      <p>“What happened on Thursday night in Orinda was horrible. I feel for the families and neighbors impacted by this tragedy. We are working to support them,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brian-chesky/">Chesky</a> said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>People with knowledge of the transaction say the woman who rented the home lied to her <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/airbnb-inc/">Airbnb</a> host, saying she was renting it so her asthmatic family members could escape wildfire smoke. More than 100 people had gathered for the party, police said.</p>
      <p>House parties have long been an issue for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/airbnb-inc/">Airbnb</a>.</p>
      <p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/airbnb-inc/">Airbnb</a> permanently banned a man who crammed more than 250 people into an <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/airbnb-inc/">Airbnb</a> rental in Seven Hills, Ohio, for an unauthorized New Year’s party while his host hid in a bedroom.</p>
