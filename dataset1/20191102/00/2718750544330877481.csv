The Photograph Trailer Is Lakeith Stanfield Charming You and Issa Rae Into Loving Him
02 Nov 2019, 00:06 by Jordan Crucchiola



There is a plenty of Holiday romance on the way, but don’t sleep on Valentine’s Day! The trailer was released today for The Photograph, a movie in which Lakeith Stanfield plays, by all early indications, a wonderful man who is in love with Issa Rae, and she has to decide if she’s willing to be loved. Rae’s character has just discovered a cache of letters from her deceased mother written to her that share previously unknown stories about her life and work as a photographer and thoughts on love (with a devastatingly handsome Y’lan Noel). Stanfield’s character is writing a profile about Rae’s mom, but soon enough is enamored of her, and it’s all glowing skin and meaningful looks from there. Like we said, The Photograph comes out on Valentine’s Day.
