      <h1>Donald Trump Jr. recalls playing video games with Michael Jackson in n</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T00:00:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/andrew-blake/" target="_blank">Andrew Blake</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump-jr/">Donald Trump Jr.</a> recalls playing video games as a kid with the late, disgraced pop singer <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-jackson/">Michael Jackson</a> in the first son’s forthcoming book, a report said Saturday.</p>
      <p>President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump-jr/">Trump</a>’s eldest son mentions <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-jackson/">Jackson</a> in the book, “Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us,” while pushing back against claims that his father is racist, Bloomberg reported after obtaining an advance copy.</p>
      <p>Mr. Trump Jr., 41, writes in the book that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-jackson/">Jackson</a> lived in Trump Tower and used to come over to play video games with him and his younger brother, Eric Trump, 35, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-02/donald-trump-jr-has-a-few-grievances-to-air-in-upcoming-book">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“Oh, and by the way, given all the things my father has been called, particularly a ‘racist,’ it sure sounds odd that he’d let his son vacation with a black man or hang out with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-jackson/">Michael Jackson</a>, doesn’t it? If he’s a racist, he’s sure not very good at it,” he reportedly writes in the book.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-jackson/">Jackson</a> died in 2009 at age 50. One of the world’s most acclaimed entertainers while alive, his reputation has been severely tarnished following the release of a documentary this year that resurfaced sexual abuse allegations first made against the singer decades earlier.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>Directed by Dan Reed and released by HBO, the documentary “Finding Neverland” profiles two adult men in their 30 who allege they were sexually abused by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-jackson/">Jackson</a> when they were children.</p>
      <p>Several of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-jackson/">Jackson</a>’s past collaborators have subsequently denounced the singer following the film’s release, while the Jackson estate has sued HBO over the film for allegedly violating a non-disparagement agreement from 1992.</p>
      <p>Ivana Trump, the president’s first wife and the mother to both of his adult sons, previously discussed the family’s relationship with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-jackson/">Jackson</a> in her own book, 2017’s “Raising Trump.”</p>
      <p>“The only person who had an open invitation to come to the triplex for playdates whenever he wanted was <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-jackson/">Michael Jackson</a>,” she wrote in the book. “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-jackson/">The King</a> of Pop lived in Trump Tower and was a good friend of the whole family. He’d stop by and chat with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump-jr/">Donald</a> and me for a few minutes, and then he’d go up to the kids’ floor to hang out for hours and hours.”</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump-jr/">Ms. Trump</a>, 70, recalled in her memoir that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-jackson/">Jackson</a> would watch MTV with her kids and play video games including Super Mario Brothers and Tetris.</p>
        <p>“<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-jackson/">Michael</a> was a thirty-year-old kid,” she recalled. “He was a child himself in a man’s body, tender, sweet and gentle. I never believed the accusations that he molested those kids. There’s no way he could have hurt anyone.”</p>
        <p>Her son’s book is scheduled to be released on Tuesday.</p>
