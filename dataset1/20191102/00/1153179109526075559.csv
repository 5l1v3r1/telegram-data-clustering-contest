02 Nov 2019 by عصر ايران



یک منبع سیاسی عراقی از درخواست مسئولان اروپایی برای انتقال ۱۳ هزار داعشی از سوریه به عراق خبر داد.
به گزارش ایسنا، این منبع به روسیاالیوم گفت: مسئولان اروپایی اخیرا به عراق سفر کرده و از مسئولان این کشور خواسته‌اند داعشی‌های موجود در سوریه را به عراق منتقل و آنها را محاکمه کنند اما بغداد این درخواست را نپذیرفته است.
دولت بغداد دلیل مخالفت خود با درخواست اروپایی‌ها را این مساله اعلام کرده است که نمی‌خواهد کسانی را که در خاکش مرتکب جنایت نشده‌اند، محاکمه کند.
