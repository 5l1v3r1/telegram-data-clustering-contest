02 Nov 2019 by Bridget Arsenault

Bear Brooksbank has always been enchanted by precious stones. Having first trained as an actress and then working in a central London contemporary art gallery, Bear returned to her passion in her early twenties, working for Humphrey Butler, a highly respected jewellery dealer in Mayfair. Simultaneously, she trained as a gemologist and designer at the prestigious Gemological Institute of America. In 2012, she established the Bear Brooksbank brand in East London, specialising in bespoke and commission-based projects, whilst also holding a collection of fine jewellery pieces available to buy. Earlier this year, her name rippled through the international press for having designed the bold octagonal ruby and diamond ring Harry Wentworth-Stanley had made to propose to Cressida Bonas - the British actress previously linked to Prince Harry.

1. How did you first setup shop and create the Bear Brooksbank brand, and what were some of the early landmark milestones? I first set up the brand in 2012 with a selection of one-off pieces, ready-to-wear pieces, a curated selection of antique and vintage jewellery, and a full bespoke service. 
2. What are some of the design elements that define your brand and aesthetic? What sets you apart from your competitors? We have a very strong appreciation for, and understanding of, antique jewellery. I was brought up around and have worked in antique jewellery for many years, whilst having an eye for offering a modern take on old ideas. 
3. What advice do you have for other young entrepreneurs? Take risks. Take time to look back at how far you have come, even if the present feels like you’re moving at a snail’s pace. Build relationships with others in the same boat, even if the medium is different. Approach your professional relationships with authority, integrity, humour and kindness. And for me, total trust in my network and extended team is absolutely key. This provides the most wonderful feeling of support.

4. Talk me through your brand - the bespoke, vintage and core collection - and why you've developed your brand in this way? I have never written a business plan and so my approach has been instinct-led and one of trial and error. Bespoke pieces will always be the core of our brand and pivotal to the business, and the ready-to- wear collections and the antique and vintage collection have been built around this. We want to be a one-stop-shop for our clients, bringing back that old-fashioned idea of having a family jeweller. 
5. When you meet someone at a party, how do you describe what you do? I work in jewellery. I am a bit shy about talking about what I do when not at work, so I tend to loosely say that I work in jewellery and move on. 
6. Walk me through the experience and chronology when someone contacts you to create a bespoke piece through to when you deliver the finished product? The bespoke process tends to take three months from the initial consultation, either by phone or at the showroom, to delivery of the piece. I like the design part of the process to feel leisurely and relaxed, so the client feels they have time and can really immerse themselves in the experience. The actual hand-making of the piece by our master craftsmen in Hatton Gardens takes around six weeks.

7. What has been the biggest pinch-me moment so far? There have been a few star-studded ones, but really what has and always will give me the greatest sense of achievement and pleasure is seeing a client genuinely moved by a piece of jewellery that I have designed. Our relationship to jewellery is so heavily led by sentiment and a sense of occasion, and it’s such a joy to be a part of this.
9. Tell me about the most unusual stones you've used and how you source them? It would have to be a peach-coloured garnet from a stone cutter I greatly admire (Top Notch Faceting). It was love at first sight. We source stones mainly here in London, and the source depends on the kind of material we are looking for. 
10. What do you know now that you wish you had known starting out? Trust your own judgement, it will always see you right. Because ultimately everyone is winging it. Allow others to help and be humble. 
11. What are the trends you've picked up on around how people buy and wear jewellery in 2019 and how that has changed over the past few years? In terms of engagement rings I would say that 50 percent of couples now enter the process together rather than the man doing it on his own and proposing with a ready- made ring. Target rings are certainly making a huge comeback, which is music to my ears. 
12. Tell me about some of the most unusual places you've found vintage pieces or how do you go about beginning to assemble a collection of vintage wares? We buy antique and vintage pieces from all over the world. Often clients will bring in pieces to sell that they no longer wear or want to put the funds towards something new or bespoke. In terms of curating the collection, we only buy things that we would like to wear ourselves; it’s worked so far!
14. How has social media changed what you do? We get a lot of enquiries though Instagram. It’s a much more informal way of sharing our work than the website, and it gives a behind-the-scenes feel that our clients love and we love to share.

New Georgian Residence for Iranians
02 Nov 2019 by Asr Iran

The Georgians have found that most Iranian registered companies are formal and have no turnover.




Georgians say you need to bring in at least $ 1,000 in capital to buy a residence in addition to buying property. ""There are two reasons for this, first of all, that Georgia is trying to join the European Union and has made the investment requirement for its migrants mandatory,"" says Maryam Soltani, a member of the board of directors of the Iran-Georgia Joint Chamber.
The Georgians rejected the Iranians' breasts, and it is not enough to buy a house to get a Georgian residence, the Shahrvand newspaper wrote. Maryam Soltani, a member of the board of directors of the Iran-Georgia Chamber of Commerce, said, ""According to the country's new regulations, Iranian citizens must bring at least $ 1,000 worth of property to Georgia in order to obtain residence in Georgia."" ""Georgia's Iranian brokers hide this from immigrants and continue to lie in their advertising, buying property is enough to get a residence,"" he says.
Deportation of Iranians from Georgia comes at a time when Iranians have broken a record five-year outflow from the country and withdrew $ 5 billion in foreign currency, according to the IMF. Ali Purabrahimi, former chairman of the 10th Majlis Economic Commission, and Mohammad Bagher Nobakht, head of the Budget and Planning Organization, said the money was spent on buying houses in neighboring countries.
It is interesting to note that the real intention of many Iranians who bought homes in neighboring countries was not to invest and work. ""Georgians have found that most Iranian registered companies are formal and have no turnover, which is why they have put a magnifying glass on Iranian immigrants and are making stricter acceptance of them,"" says Maryam Soltani.
Challenge of the Iranian economy by the desire to buy a foreign house Iranians have bought about $ 5 billion in foreign currency and bought houses in neighboring countries. The announcement was made by Mohammad Reza Pourabrahimi, former head of the 10th Majlis Economic Commission, who said that according to the International Monetary Fund, the capital outflow record was broken in 2008, and Iran experienced one of the most severe economic conditions with the exit of $ 5 billion, a figure that Mohammed Baghbakhr, The head of the program and the budget also endorsed it, saying that the wave of foreign property buying has caused the currency market crisis. It is not clear how many Iranians bought the property overseas, but Turkey has made clearer and more accurate statistics than other neighboring countries that Iranian citizens have bought just under 1,000 houses in Izmir in one year.
However, the average property price in Georgia is much lower than in Turkey. The average property price in Tbilisi is between $ 6,000 and $ 3,000 in Istanbul and Ankara, and the cheaper Georgian market has made the country more attractive to Iranians than Turkey. ""Most Iranians who bought homes in Georgia come from the middle class,"" he says.
Maryam Soltani, a member of the board of directors of the Iran-Georgia Chamber of Commerce, also explains: ""The rate of Iranian immigration to Georgia is so high that it is said that the Iranian administration has been having difficulty processing Iranian demand.""
Iranians Auction Wood to Georgian Homes Despite Iranians' interest in Georgia, Georgians treat the Iranians as ethical. In December last year, Georgia returned Iranian-Iranians from the airport to Iran, at a time when the Iranian Foreign Ministry issued a statement urging Iranians to avoid unnecessary travel to Georgia. This happened while Georgia was one of the countries where Iranians could travel without a visa, but recently Georgians have become sensitive to the wave of Iranian immigration to their country. They had earlier returned Iranian farmers from their homeland who had migrated to Georgia during the drought to work on their rented land.
Massoud Rasaf, an Iranian citizen who went to Georgia four years ago and bought a 4-hectare farm in the outskirts of Georgia's Kutaisi city, said Georgians were tough on the Iranians for administrative work, not just cooperating with the administrative process of setting up the agro-industry complex. Since his re-entry into their country, thereforeHe has been forced to advertise plowed and ready-to-plant land for sale. This has been repeated for homeowners in Georgia and the country has said that buying property is not enough to obtain permanent residence and Iranians can only buy one year in this respect. This has made it easier to sell property ads in Georgia than ever before, and Iranians who have come to terms with the new regulations are no longer willing to easily buy other Iranian properties in Georgia. On the other hand, profitable Georgians also set lower prices to buy Iranian homes in their country.
Some Iranians pessimize Georgians Georgians say you need to bring at least $ 3,000 in capital to buy a residence in addition to buying property. ""There are two reasons for this, first of all, that Georgia is trying to join the European Union and has made the investment requirement for its migrants mandatory,"" says Maryam Soltani, a member of the board of directors of the Iran-Georgia Joint Chamber.
“Georgia is, in fact, a more capital-intensive country than an immigrant country, which is why it has implemented this law to grow economically,” he said.
A look at the World Bank report shows that Georgia is the seventh country in the world in terms of ease of doing business and it has been planning to attract investors for many years.
A member of the board of directors of the Iran-Georgia Joint Chamber also explains: ""In addition to the Georgians' view of capitalism, the fraud of some Iranian citizens in this country has made them more skeptical of Iranian investors and to accept them more strictly in their own country.""
""Iranians in Georgia have registered numerous face-to-face companies that their banks have noticed that these Iranian companies and bank accounts have no annual turnover, and in fact Iranian citizens have turned their head to seek residency,"" Soltani said.
Georgia's economy is nearly as large as Tehran's, not very wealthy in terms of economy, and unemployment rate is not much different from that of Iran. Georgia's unemployment rate is currently 4.3 percent and almost half of its population are farmers, which does not mean it will be difficult to work in Georgia, according to a World Bank report on one of the world's top five countries for ease of business regulation. Is. Georgia's foreign trade volume is about $ 5 billion annually, and Iran has about five times its foreign trade.
Georgia also has about $ 5 billion in GDP, according to the World Bank. However, Iran's GDP is $ 5 billion. A comparison of the two figures shows that Iran's economy is almost 5 times larger than the Georgian economy.
Inflation rate in Georgia is only 0.8 percent, while inflation rate in Iran is about 2 percent.
