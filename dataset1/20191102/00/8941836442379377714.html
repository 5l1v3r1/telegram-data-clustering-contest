      <p>JEFFERSONVILLE, Ind. (AP) - A southern Indiana man who molested children while working at a YMCA and at an elementary school has lost his initial bid for a sentence reduction.</p>
      <p>Twenty-year-old Michael Begin of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffersonville/">Jeffersonville</a> received a 120-year sentence in April after pleading guilty to molesting 20 children.</p>
      <p>The News and Tribune reports Begin’s attorneys sought to have his sentence cut to 60 years and served in a combination of prison time, community corrections and probation.</p>
      <p>They argued that his 120-year sentence was essentially a life sentence for a man with no prior criminal record facing non-homicide charges.</p>
      <p>But the Indiana Court of Appeals rejected that request Wednesday, citing the nature of Begin’s crimes.</p>

      <p>Begin’s attorney Tom Lowe says the ruling is disappointing and they will likely “seek transfer to the Indiana Supreme Court.”</p>
