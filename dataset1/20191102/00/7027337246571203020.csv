Manny Bermudez Announces His UFC Release
02 Nov 2019 by Jay Pettry



Following his Ultimate Fighting Championship release, Manny Bermudez looks elsewhere to continue his career.On Friday, Bermudez (14-2) posted on Instagram, that he has been released from his UFC contract. This comes on the heels of a two-fight skid, and he most recently dropped his bout against Charles Rosa by first-round armbar at UFC on ESPN 6 two weeks prior. In his post, he reached out to other promotions including One Championship, Professional Fighters League and Bellator MMA.His statement reads as follows:So unfortunately the UFC has decided to cut me. Far as I'm concerned this this just an opportunity for growth and improvement. No harsh feelings, no worries, I know what I can bring to the table. Looking forward to new beginnings in the near future. Thankful as always for a great team, great friends, and a great family @onechampionship @m1global @pflmma @canalcombate @bellatormma (Also whenever I put something like this up everyone thinks I'm depressed or something, I'm good, just keeping you all in the loop) #ShootersShoot #StillMoney #MoneyBermudez.Bermudez was signed by the Las Vegas-based promotion with a perfect 11-0 record, with two decisions among nine stoppages including eight by tapout. Nicknamed ""The Bermudez Triangle,"" he celebrated half of those submission wins by triangle choke, including his last two that led to his signing.The Massachusetts native struggled to make weight in his recent UFC tenure, missing weight by four pounds against Benito Lopez in February. From there, out of concerns that he would come in heavy once more against Casey Kenney, the promotion opted to make the bout a 140-pound catchweight contest. It was against Kenney that he suffered his first career defeat, and this prompted his move to the featherweight division. In his first trip inside the Octagon at 145 pounds, Bermudez again came in several pounds over the limit against Rosa, and in doing so became one of a small number of fighters to ever miss weight at two different weight classes.

A translator's reaction to the cancellation of his book
02 Nov 2019 by Asr Iran



Saber Hosseini regrets the cancellation of his translation of the book ""Shame"" by Alif Shafak, of the damage he says is to readers of the book.
""Shame"" translator of the recently revoked license, Elif Shafak, told ISNA in an interview with ISNA: ""Pearl Publishing has not told me anything. This is really sad and I don't know what to say. This book is also published by another publisher, as far as I know, its fourth edition.
""This book is about two Armenian and Istanbul families living in the United States,"" he said. The theme of the story is centered around the concerns of Armenian families about what happened in World War I. In fact, the book shows the sentiments of the Armenian and Turkish people on the subject of the massacres of Armenians during World War I. Throughout the story there are some intricacies about the Karanchi family. What happens is the blind knot of the story that opens at the end. I suspect this was the reason for the shame.
Hosseini regretted the incident: The sharp, sharp look of guidance that censors the book is unacceptable. This work by Elif Shafak has been published and published in various languages around the world since year 6. I can't imagine wanting to delete the whole book because of what is happening in the story and part of the story. I'm sorry and I don't know what to say.
He added: The original name of the book in Turkish is ""Father and Bastard"" and the English version is ""Bastard of Istanbul"". We tried to choose a name that would not be slandered because of its title, so we chose 'shame'. It was a great book, but it did. However, I hope that the Friends of Guidance in their decision will open the way for readers to reconsider and not disappoint them.
The translator then stated: With the cancellation of the book, the translator may go to another book. But the biggest blow to the reader is his confidence in literature. With the revocation of licenses, it comes to the point that much has been manipulated in the book that has been licensed to the reader. Therefore, the first person to lose in this section is the reader, whose confidence in both Iranian and foreign literature is deprived. Guidance friends should be aware of this. On the one hand, with the aim of increasing people's reading of the book, we spend provincial fairs and, on the other hand, destroy the reader's confidence. Someone who wants to read a book first thinks that the book is censored.
