      <p>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) - A U.N. human rights team is gathering testimony about hundreds of people allegedly injured by Chile’s police during protests in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>The team on Friday received accounts about ruptured eyeballs, broken bones and other serious injuries allegedly inflicted by police pellets or the impact of tear gas canisters.</p>
      <p>Authorities have countered allegations of brutality, saying dozens of police officers have been injured during attacks by protesters.</p>
      <p>At least 20 people have died in the protests, which started after the government announced a hike in subway fares. The protest movement expanded to include broader grievances over education, health services and growing economic inequality.</p>
