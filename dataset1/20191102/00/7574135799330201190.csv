David Byrne’s American Utopia @ Hudson TheatreDavid Byrne has retooled his acclaimed “untethered” 2018 for the Broadway stage and while the setlist and arrangements are much like what they were on his tour, songs are now threaded together with new monologues from Byrne, making for a much more theatrical experience.

J.S. Ondara, Elise Davis @ Music Hall of WilliamsburgFolk singer J.S. Ondara has a voice that can silence the room as soon as he opens his mouth, and it’s no surprise that the size of the rooms he’s playing keeps increasing.
