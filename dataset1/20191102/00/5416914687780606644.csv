Trump rallies supporters in Mississippi after House impeachment probe vote, ahead of tight governor's race
02 Nov 2019, 00:51 by Vandana Rambaran
President Trump rallied supporters in Tupelo, Miss., on Friday night in a bid to shore up Republican support ahead of the state's tightest gubernatorial race in nearly a generation.
Trump attacked former vice president and 2020 candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden over their Ukrainian business dealings, accusing the media -- specifically CNN's Anderson Cooper and Chris Cuomo, who again Trump referred to as ""Fredo"" -- of covering up potential Biden corruption.
""The press protects him,"" said the president, who also called Biden ""One Percent Joe.""

Trump also slammed the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, calling it a ""preposterous hoax"" one day after the House voted to formalize the rules of their impeachment process, and accused Democrats of trying to ""delegitimatize"" the 2016 presidential election.
House committees have held nearly a dozen closed-door depositions from witnesses regarding their knowledge of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. An anonymous intelligence community whistleblower has alleged that Trump sought to persuade Zelensky to open an investigation into Joe Biden, his son Hunter and their business dealings in Ukraine in exchange for military aid to the Eastern European nation.
""Do you think I would say something improper when I know there are so many people listening?"" Trump asked the crowd.
Beto 'a total fool'
The president also mocked former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, just hours after the Texas Democrat announced his withdrawal from the 2020 presidential election.
Trump called O'Rourke a ""poor bastard"" and a ""poor pathetic guy"" who ""made a total fool of himself"" in the race for the White House.
""Hopefully, we won't be hearing about him for a long time,"" Trump added.
""Hopefully, we won't be hearing about him for a long time.""— President Trump

Trump also decried Hillary Clinton's recent comments about Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii. The former secretary of state didn't mention Gabbard by name, but suggested that Gabbard was being groomed to be a third-party presidential candidate in 2020.
Trump said, ""I don't know who Tulsi Gabbard is but I know one thing, she's not an agent for Russia.""
Clinton made similar comments about 2016 Green Party candidate Jill Stein, to which Trump responded: ""I don't know Jill Stein ... I know she's not an agent of Russia.""
Baghdadi's 'ticket to hell'
The president opened his remarks at Bancorp South Arena by celebrating the U.S. military raid that led to the death of Islamic State (ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, saying it had ""ended his wretched life and punched out his ticket to hell.""
""We have a great military. It was very very depleted when I came into office ... but it ain't depleted anymore,"" said Trump, who called Baghdadi ""a savage and soulless monster but his reign of terror is over.""

Trump lamented the media's coverage of the military's most recent feat, saying that if former President Barack Obama had killed the leader of ISIS, the media would have the story ""going on for another seven months.""
""Conan the dog got more publicity than me -- and I'm very happy about it,"" Trump said of the heroic military dog who was injured while pursuing Baghdadi through a tunnel underneath a compound in northwestern Syria.
""Conan the dog got more publicity than me -- and I'm very happy about it.""— President Trump

""While we're creating jobs and killing terrorists, the Democrat Party has gone completely insane,"" Trump said.
Backing Tate Reeves
Hundreds of people had waited to see Trump at the rally to support Republican gubernatorial candidate Tate Reeves, who is finishing his second term as Mississippi's lieutenant governor after previously serving two terms as the elected state treasurer.



Reeves briefly joined Trump onstage and accused the ""radical liberals"" of ""disrespecting"" Trump by pursuing impeachment against him and urged the crowd to elect ""an ally to Donald J. Trump.""
""He'll never let you down,"" Trump said of Reeves. ""And don't kid yourself, your Second Amendment is under attack.""
Reeves has spent $10.8 million in the race to succeed term-limited Gov. Phil Bryant, while his Democratic opponent, state attorney general Jim Hood, has spent $5.2 million. Both are receiving financial support from national governors' groups in their parties.




VIDEOTrump blames Democrats' House election worries for resolution vote

Reeves has sought to tie Hood as closely as possible to national Democrats, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who are deeply unpopular in a state that voted heavily for Trump in the last presidential election.
Hood has not invited national Democratic figures to Mississippi and is running campaign commercials that show him with his family, his pickup truck and his hunting dog, Buck. In one, Hood unpacks a rifle and says that ""Tate Reeves and his out-of-state corporate masters"" are spending money on a ""bunch of lies.""

""You all know me. I've worked for you for years. I do my job and I'm a straight shooter,"" Hood says. The spot ends with Hood shooting the gun and shattering a bottle.
Hood is also running radio ads designed to appeal to African American voters — including one with an endorsement from former U.S. Rep. Mike Espy, who ran a strong but ultimately unsuccessful race for U.S. Senate in Mississippi last year, and another that mentions Hood leading the successful 2005 prosecution of Ku Klux Klan leader Edgar Ray Killen in the 1964 murder of three civil rights workers.
The outreach reflects the importance of black voters to any possible Hood victory. African Americans make up 38 percent of the state's population, but some say they're irritated by Hood's emphasis on courting rural white voters.

The United States contradicts its position to fight terrorism

By seizing Syrian oil, the United States contradicts its position that all it does is fight terrorism

By claiming the right to Syrian oil, Donald Trump further complicated the mission of the US military in Syria after saying twice that it was time for the soldiers to return home.
The US president said his country was going to protect the Syrian oil fields and gave the Pentagon a reason, that it claimed that a total withdrawal could revive the Islamic State organization even though its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had died during a Recent US military operation.
The military admitted Thursday that an army unit with armored vehicles is operating in the Deir el-Zour oil region. They did not say how many troops there are, but some officials indicated that it would be about 500.
Trump gave several versions of the military's role in the eastern part of Syria. On October 25, he said that ""we have insured oil, so there will be a few men left in the oil zone."" Three days later, he went further and said that the oil was from the United States.
""We keep the oil, remember that,"" he said in Chicago. ""I always said it:"" You have to conserve oil. "" We want to protect the oil. 45 million dollars a month? Let's keep the oil. ”
White House officials have not wanted to clarify what Trump meant by ""conserve oil"" or say where his estimate of the value of that oil came from. Pentagon officials, meanwhile, said privately that they were ordered to seize any component of Syria's oil resources, including wells and stored oil.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Thursday that he interprets Trump's words as a warning that terrorists will be denied access to oil.
In Syria there is a civil war since 2011. Its oil production has been reduced from 400,000 barrels per day to about 80,000, according to Jim Krane, an expert on energy issues at Rice University.
Russia was shocked by the appropriation of Syrian oil by Trump, saying it was a ""pillage at the state level."" A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Major General Igor Konashenkov, said that by seizing Syrian oil, the United States contradicts its position that all it does is fight terrorism and ""depart from the ideals proclaimed by Washington."" For years, the United States has said that military interventions abroad were intended to strengthen peace and security, not seize territories or resources of other nations.
Stephen Vladeck, a professor of law specializing in national security at the University of Texas at Austin, said there is no solid legal argument to justify the United States claiming a right to Syrian oil.
Legal aside, analysts say the mission is extremely dangerous.
""It's a barrel of gunpowder,"" said Loren DeJonge Schulman, deputy director of the Center for New Security in the United States and held senior positions at the Pentagon and the White House under the presidency of Barack Obama.
""We are sending soldiers with very weak legal justifications, knowing that their commander in chief can change their mind, as he has done so many times in the past,"" he said, adding that for a long time many people have been saying that the real interest United States in the Middle East is oil.
Esper has said that the control of the Deir el-Zour oil fields is a legitimate way to deprive the Islamic State of an important source of resources and to finance the Kurds of Syria, who continue to fight against EI. A few years ago, when EIestablished a caliphate today disappeared, that organization exploited oil after seizing large tracts of land in Syria and Iraq.
US forces expelled EI from the oil fields and for three years the Kurds have controlled that resource, supported by a small contingent of US soldiers.
Esper told reporters that the mission in Deir el-Zour includes blocking any Russian or Syrian interference in that region east of the Euphrates River.
Trump has made it clear that his goal is oil and that he is willing to fight for it.
""We are leaving soldiers to secure oil,"" he said Sunday. “We may have to fight for oil. It's okay. Maybe someone wants that oil, in which case they will have to fight. ”
