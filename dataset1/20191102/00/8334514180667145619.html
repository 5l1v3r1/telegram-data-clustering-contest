      <p>ARCADIA, Calif. (Reuters) - Storm the Court fended off a late challenge from fellow longshot Anneau d’Or to win the Breeders’ Cup $2 million Juvenile by a neck in a stunning upset at Santa Anita Park on Friday.</p>
      <p>Dennis’ Moment, the 4-5 favorite, stumbled as he left the gate from his position on the inside post and ended up finishing last.</p>
      <p>That opened the door to the other 2-year olds and 45-1 Storm the Court took full advantage as jockey Flavien Prat managed to maintain the lead he built up early in the race even as 25-1 Anneau d’Or closed quickly down the stretch.</p>
      <p>Wrecking Crew finished third in the 1-1/16 mile race on dirt, which is often seen as a preview of contenders in next year’s Triple Crown races.</p>
      <p>“All of us are extremely excited about this,” Storm the Court owner Justin Border said.</p>
      <p>“Special thanks to Flavien for sticking with a horse with such a big heart and on behalf of all the owners and partners of Storm the Court, we’re proud to be on his team,” he said.</p>
      <p>“He just represents a lot of good things with racing.”</p>
      <p>Santa Anita Park has been under scrutiny for a spate of horse deaths this year but no horses were injured during the nine races on Friday, which played out before a crowd of 41,243.</p>
      <p>Racing resumes on Saturday, highlighted by the $6 million Breeders’ Cup Classic.</p>
