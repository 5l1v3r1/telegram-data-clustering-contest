The US State Department: Iran is the worst state sponsor of terrorism in the world

02 Nov 2019

Iran remains the world's worst state sponsor of terrorism and is funding international terrorist groups involved in terrorist conspiracy, especially in Europe, the State Department said in a report. Iran spends about $ 1 billion a year to support terrorist groups acting on its behalf and is expanding its wicked influence around the world. Nathan Sills, the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, said the Iranian terrorist threat was not confined to the Middle East. The report is issued annually by the US State Department since 2004 on the basis of a mandate. The Department is required to keep the US Congress regularly updated on the global terrorism situation.
