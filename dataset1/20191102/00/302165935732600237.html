      <h1>Offered ‘less than US$2b’ to settle 1MDB suit, Dr M suggests Goldman Sachs do better</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 2 — The Malaysian government rejected Goldman Sachs’ offer of “less than US$2 billion (RM8.3 billion)” as reparations for its role in the 1MDB financial fraud, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said.</p>
      <p>Dr Mahathir suggested to the <i>Financial Times</i> (FT) in an interview yesterday that Malaysia considered the offer unreasonable as it demanded US$7.5 billion, the estimated financial damage incurred by the country as a result of bonds issues the US investment bank handled for 1MDB.</p>
      <p>“Goldman Sachs has offered something like less than US$2 billion... if they respond reasonably we might not insist on ­getting that US$7.5 billion,” he was quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>The prime minister said Putrajaya has also contacted Deutsche Bank and UBS to inquire about their roles in the financial fraud perpetrated in the name of the state investment firm.</p>
      <p>The federal government is reportedly in negotiations with Goldman for the compensation sum, in a departure from its previous insistence that the US firm pay the full US$7.5 billion demanded.</p>
      <p>The Bloomberg news service reported that a Malaysian team including Tun Daim Zainuddin were in talks for a settlement of between US$2 billion and US$3 billion.</p>
      <p>A source told Bloomberg that Dr Mahathir was keen on a swift settlement in order to demonstrate the government’s progress in recovering funds allegedly misappropriated from 1MDB.</p>
      <p>In 2012 and 2013, the bank raised US$6.5 billion for 1MDB, much of which the US has alleged was ultimately stolen in a scheme masterminded by Malaysian fugitive Low Taek Jho or Jho Low, a central figure in the scandal who has denied wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>Malaysia charged Goldman Sachs under the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 over its role in the bonds issues.</p>
      <p>Goldman declined to comment on the FT’s report.</p>
