      <p>MAYFIELD, Ky. (AP) - A prominent painter whose works capture the rural, small town culture of Kentucky turned 100 on Saturday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/helen-lafrance/">Helen LaFrance</a> visited a church in Mayfield to celebrate her birthday with an unexpectedly large group of friends and family. A documentary about her also was shown at a separate church in Mayfield.</p>
      <p>According to a press release, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/helen-lafrance/">LaFrance</a>’s paintings are housed in museums in the U.S. and Europe, and in the collections of Oprah Winfrey and Bryant Gumbel. The self-taught, African American painter’s works show people at church, family gatherings, funerals and other aspects of small-town life in western Kentucky.</p>
      <p>One of her first known public works is a mural in the St. James AME Church in Mayfield, completed in 1947. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/helen-lafrance/">LaFrance</a> also has worked in wood carving and quilting.</p>
      <p>Longtime friend Wanda Stubblefield calls <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/helen-lafrance/">LaFrance</a> a modest and private person who does not seek attention or recognition.</p>

      <p>“When she saw everyone today, she just gave a little smile, an embarrassed-looking smile, that it was all for her,” Stubblefield said in a phone interview.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/helen-lafrance/">LaFrance</a> was born in a small community in Graves County, Kentucky. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/helen-lafrance/">LaFrance</a> and her sisters grew up on the family’s farm, where cotton and tobacco were grown, and pigs, chickens and cows were raised.</p>
      <p>She could draw before she learned to write, making paintings on large tablets and leftover wallpaper.</p>
      <p>“Mom used to hold my hand and help me to draw things,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/helen-lafrance/">LaFrance</a> said in the press release.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/helen-lafrance/">LaFrance</a>’s first work was a large gray rabbit painted in watercolors on the back of a piece of wallpaper, according to a bio on the Kentucky Commission on Human Rights’ webpage.</p>
        <p>Later in life, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/helen-lafrance/">LaFrance</a> worked in a hospital, tobacco barns and a ceramic factory, where she decorated whiskey bottles, the press release said. Still, she did not begin her “memory painting” full time until 1986.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/helen-lafrance/">LaFrance</a> now lives in a nursing home and no longer paints regularly. But her legacy lives on in her art, two documentaries and a book about her life.</p>
        <p>Stubblefield, also from Kentucky, said she recognizes scenes painted by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/helen-lafrance/">LaFrance</a>.</p>
        <p>“What was famous about her is she always did a lot of church scenes, and that’s the church we attended all the time,” Stubblefield said. “It’s the church where we had the church picnics.”</p>
        <p>The documentary “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/helen-lafrance/">Helen LaFrance</a>: Memories” recently screened at the Saint Louis Art Museum.</p>
