      <p>MENDON, Massachusetts (CNN) - For many, winning a big lottery jackpot is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>
      <p>But it looks like lightning has struck twice for Rolf Rhodes.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.masslottery.com/winners/">Massachusetts State Lottery</a> said on Wednesday that he just won $1 million bucks in its "$4,000,000 Instant Jackpot" game.</p>
      <p>To grab what would become the second golden ticket of his life, Rhodes walked into the Imperial Gas and Country Store in Mendon, a town about 40 miles southwest of Boston.</p>
      <p>When he made his latest life-changing purchase, he managed to beat odds of 1 in 1.68 million, according to the <a href="https://www.masslottery.com/games/instant/10-dollar/$4m-instant-jackpot-160-2017.html">lottery</a>.</p>
      <p>Rhodes won his first million in the state's "Hit $1,000" instant game back in May 2018. He opted to receive that prize in a one-time infusion of $650,000 into his bank account.</p>
      <p>This time, he's chosen to receive his $1 million payout in 20 annual installments, valued at $50,000 apiece before taxes, the lottery says.</p>
      <p>Rhodes' million is just a quarter of the total in the state's "$4,000,000 Instant Jackpot" game. There are three remaining $1 million jackpot prizes still up for grabs, the lottery says.</p>
      <p>And while lightning doesn't usually strike twice in the same place, it appears to have been close.</p>
      <p>Rhodes purchased his first winning ticket in Milford, Massachusetts, a town just next to Mendon, CNN affiliate <a href="https://whdh.com/news/mendon-man-wins-1m-scratch-ticket-prize-for-2nd-time-in-18-months/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook_7News_-_WHDH_Boston">WHDH</a> reported.</p>
