El estallido social y político en Chile traspasó las fronteras, movilizando a miles de compatriotas que, desde distintos puntos del mundo, se han manifestado a favor de las demandas ciudadanas que se piden al gobierno de Sebastián Piñera.
Uno de ellos fue Edmundo Huerta, más conocido como Di Mondo. El chileno, ícono de la moda y con una amplia cantidad de seguirdores en sus redes sociales, impactó en su cuenta de Instagram (@itsdimondosworld) al compartir unas imágenes en apoyo a las movilizaciones que se producen en el país.
""Han sido dos semanas muy intensas y tristes. Ha sido horrible ver desde lejos lo que sucede, me duele en el alma pero a la misma vez tenemos que tener la fuerza y la esperanza que Chile pueda reflorecer en un mejor país para todos ¡Un abrazo grande!"", escribió Di Mondo en su cuenta.
Bañado en sangre (pintura roja) y con la bandera nacional también ensangretada, Di Mondo desafió las reglas comunitarias de Instagram, pero a la vez sumó miles de mensajes de apoyo.

He says that even four years before his father died he bought the land on which his remains now rest and regularly went to visit the space that would be his last abode.
Laughing, he remembers that Don Ismael proposed one day to place a wooden cross on the small land he acquired for the day of his death and they all agreed with him that it was an excess since there was no name to put on the cross. “I remember that we told him. What name are you going to give the cross dad if you're alive? That's how he was, a man who always left everything ready and who looked until the last minute to leave us no problems, ”he said.
April assures that in addition to keeping him company in the pantheon, his father Ishmael will be received at each with a meal offering in which they place their favorite dishes since the whole family believes that in these days he will return to accompany them.

SELLERS AND MUSICIANS EXPECT TODAY TO HAVE A GOOD DAY

Although the cemeteries of the city registered an important influx of people, the profits of the sellers, musicians and workers of the pantheons were not good. And, they say that the economic crisis hits the pocket of the living and impacts the dead.
Josefina Díaz, a flower seller explained that although she had flower sales, the profits that had been made until yesterday afternoon were not the best since people arrived at the cemeteries with little budget. He indicated that even many people arrived with flowers and that those who bought looked for flowers, crowns and arrangements cheaper than other years. “People are very worn out and that looks a lot when it comes to selling them. They ask for the economic thing or buy less flowers, ”he said.














For the musicians, the first day of celebration of the dead was also somewhat low since, although music is an important part of the party, many people arrived at the pantheons with their portable speakers to set the day. Sergio, a musician from the group “Los Amigos del Valle”, explained that because of the crisis, families that if they hire the groups do so for the minimum number of songs, unlike other years in which they played up to 6 or 7 songs at the bottom of each grave. ""We offer them the package of 3 songs for 100 pesos so they are encouraged, but many times they just want one or two at most,"" he explained.
The most sung songs, he explains, remain the same year after year: fist of earth, eternal love and wooden cross. ""Already after those already ask for what the deceased or the deceased liked in a special way but those three are always drawer,"" he said.
