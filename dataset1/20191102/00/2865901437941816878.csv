Colisão entre trens deixa 47 feridos em Salvador
02 Nov 2019, 00:41 by Bruno Luiz, Especial para O Estado
Uma colisão frontal entre dois trens deixou 47 pessoas feridas na tarde desta sexta-feira, 1º, em Salvador. Não houve mortos e a maioria das vítimas sofreu ferimentos leves, segundo informações da Secretaria Municipal de Saúde (SMS) e do Corpo de Bombeiros da Bahia. A Companhia de Transportes do Estado da Bahia (CTB) diz que vai investigar as causas do acidente.
A colisão aconteceu por volta das 15h30, entre as Estações Santa Luzia e Lobato, no Subúrbio Ferroviário. Em nota, a CTB afirmou que a batida foi de ""leve intensidade"" e que teria tomado ""providências imediatas"". A operação do serviço foi interrompida e só será retomada na manhã de sábado, 2.
O coordenador do Serviço Móvel de Atendimento de Urgência (Samu), Ivan Paiva, afirmou que nenhum dos feridos tem quadro de saúde grave e ninguém ficou preso às ferragens. Segundo diz, a maioria dos casos é de escoriações, suspeitas de fratura ou contusões. O Samu foi responsável por socorrer 41 vítimas. As outras seis receberam atendimento do 1º Grupamento de Bombeiros Militares.
Entre as vítimas, 23 foram atendidos e já liberadas no local. Duas pessoas, uma com suspeita de trauma na bacia e outra com suspeita de fratura na clavícula, foram encaminhadas ao Hospital Ernesto Simões.
Segundo Paiva, o lugar do acidente era de difícil acesso. ""A via é pequena, o que fez com que algumas ambulâncias precisassem entrar de ré no local. As vítimas estavam estáveis, muita gente saiu andando e ocupou os trilhos"", disse.
Este não é o primeiro incidente com trens do Subúrbio em 2019. Em setembro, uma das composições descarrilou e deixou ao menos uma passageira ferida. No mesmo mês, um trem sofreu uma explosão na rede elétrica e provocou pânico nos passageiros. Com o susto, alguns pularam do veículo e acabaram ficando levemente feridos.
Atualmente, apenas três trens operam no sistema, que transporta uma média de 10 mil passageiros em dia útil. A malha é composta por dez estações.
O governo da Bahia planeja substituir o sistema e instalar um monotrilho para ligar o bairro do Comércio, em Salvador, à Ilha de São João, no município de Simões Filho, na região metropolitana.

Live news
17:45
88th minute
Good chance for Proleter. Babic centered a free kick, Leandro was alone seven or eight yards from the Star goal, however, he did not hit the ball well with her head and she went a meter or two past the tripod.
17:43
86th minute
Proleter moved forward, leaving plenty of room for counter-attacks on his half. This was pulled by Marin and added to Jevtovic's space, who tried to set another goal for Boaci, but badly caught the ball and the action failed.
17:39
GOOOL !!!
82nd minute - GOAL! Lead Star 2: 0! The scorer is Boaci, and Jevtović assisted him just in the game. The hit was almost identical to the first one: Jevtovic broke through the goal-line and served Boaci on the fifth.
17:37
81st minute
Last edit in Star: Jevtovic got a chance instead of Pavkov.
17:37

17:35
79th minute
Rušević controlled the ball in the Zvezda's penalty box, he wanted to play the rebound and he hit the referee Grujić! A failed solid situation for Proleter ...
17:32
76th minute
Nice combination of Zvezda players, Marin and Rodic, followed by a midfield on the fifth, but Andrejevic was well placed and eliminated the danger.
17:31
75th minute
A new proletarian change, Rušević replaced Jovanović.
17:30
74th minute
Not Pavkov today. He had another chance, got a deep ball, got in with a six-pointer, shot a further tripod and - he didn't score.
17:28
71. minute
A chance for the Proletarian! Corner for the home team, the highest in the jump was Andrejevic, he hit the ball with his head, and she was an inch past Borjan's tripod!
17:27
70th minute
Another attempt by Boaci. She didn't hit the ball well either, but she hit Leandra and changed direction, however, the Proletarian goalkeeper still managed to catch her.
17:23
67th minute
Poor attempt by Booji. He wanted everything on his own, even though he was bowed 16 meters from the proletarian goal. Finally, he grabbed the ball, which bounced past the home team.
17:20
64th minute
Edit in Proleter: Novakovic entered the game instead of Scepanovic.
17:18

Goalkeeper Simić leaves the field and Boaći enters. Another change, instead of Vulić, will be played by Jovančić in the rest of the match.
17:16
GOOOL !!!
59th minute - Lead the Star! The scorer is Mateo Garcia, who has scored a goal for Zvezda and Vojvodina in the same stadium. Simic did half the work, broke through the left side, turned the ball over to the fifth, where he ran Garcia and put the football into the net!




17:14
58th minute
Great pressure from the Red Star, two corners, a series of strikes, but the Novi Sad residents are successfully defending themselves for now. But more and more Belgraders are pushing them into their keeper's lap ...
17:12
56th minute
A series of tries by the champions, three or four strokes after a corner, but the ball had nowhere to go to reach the Proleter goal.
17:11
55th minute
Vulic lost the ball in his own half, Milosavljev withdrew the counter, but played a poor return ball to the penalty area, the action failed.
17:10
54th minute
Nemanja Milunovic also decided to test his shot from a distance. We didn't see him often in situations like this, but he tried, though unsuccessfully, the ball went far from goal.
17:08
52. minute
Proleter is also trying to organize attacks, not only standing on his own half of the field to defend himself, but for now there is no success in threatening to threaten the Star.
17:04
47th minute
Looks like we'll be looking at a similar second half.Pavkov now shot from 16 yards but made a foul before. Then try Simic.
17:02
THE SECOND HALF STARTED
The second half began in Novi Sad
16:44
HALF TIME
Half-time in Novi Sad. Proletarian managed to resist the champion through disciplined play. The Red Star had two great opportunities over Pavkov. However, it was difficult for the champion to come up with the odds. Branko Zigic's team did very well in the low zone.
16:43
43. minute
The last ten minutes were played in half of the Proletarians. But again, Star is in a difficult position to shoot at goal.
16:40
41st minute
He has repeatedly tried Jorge Kanjas to make a surplus of direct passes. He's not doing his best so far. Mostly mistaken by a Spanish international.
16:39
40th minute
Milunovic's kick after Marin's corner kick. There was no danger to Proleter.
16:36
36th minute
The best attack by the Proletarians. Everything looked nice. Tanasin slipped in, the ball went to Sinisa Babic. Well blocked by Milunovic. That would be very dangerous.
16:34
35th minute
Marin to Pavkov after a good winter of red and white. Beside the goal was shot by Zvezda's striker. They defend very well at home in the low block. The star has a hard time finding holes.
16:29
And one more spider
Another great chance for the Star. And again, Milan Pavkov was in the wrong. Centered Rodic, this time Zvezda's striker shook his head. Petric defended. There was a ball in his corner.
16:25
25 minutes
Another chance for the Star. Kovacevic intervened well in front of Garcia. It was nice to have Rodic slip the ball over to Milunovic.
16:22
22nd minute - A HUGE miss for the Spiders
Milan Pavkov's big miss. Best chance for now. They played great on Garcia and Gajic's side. He entered the six-star Zvezda back, centered at three yards, but the lone Pavkov reacted poorly. It is unknown if he wanted to miss the ball.
16:21
21 minutes
Hit Pavkov with his head. Centered by Marin. It was not the ideal situation. The ball goes over the goal.
16:18
18 minutes
A very good attempt by Branislav Jovanovic. Poorly cleaned up by one Red Star center fielder. He was kicking some 20 yards from the Proletarian midfielder. The ball goes past the goal.
16:16
17 minutes
Star tried after a corner kick. In front of Milunovic, Miraosavlje jumped great. The ball dropped to Simic. Bad shot from 16 yards.
16:15
15 minutes
Finally, Proelter managed to close at least a little. Siniša Babić crosses the ball. Very awkward it seemed. Rodic got stuck.
16:13
13 minutes
Finally because Red Star had excess space. He played well on Simic's side, but Marin lost one-on-one. It was cleanly cleaned by Andrejevic. Dynamic match. No major excitement.
16:10
10 minutes
The ball is mostly in the feet of the Red Star players. However, we are still waiting for the first, real chance at Karadjordje.
16:06
7 minutes
Very energetically played by home players. The star is hardly coming into the final third of the field. Simić made a nice surplus now, but Scepanovic reacted in front of a boisterous Gajic.
16:04
5 minutes
Vulic tried from 17-18 meters, the ball went past the goal. The first real goal kick.
16:03
4th minute
Gajic tried a long ball behind the back of the Proleter defense to hire Garcia, but the home defense thwarted the attempt.
16:01
The star is playing this match in blue jerseys, which has become almost the rule when he visits Novi Sad, either against Vojvodina or against Proleter.
15:59
IT STARTED!
The ball went off center!
15:55
The beginning of the match is approaching, a modest visit to Karadjord ...
14:58
STAR DOMINATION OVER THE PROLETER
The Red Star has played four times against the Proleters, three of them in Novi Sad. She never scored a goal and scored all four wins. In the finish last season, she struggled at Karadjordje against this rival, getting a late goal from Milan Jevtovic.
14:56
MILOJEVIC JURI JUBILEJ
For a month and a half, Proleter did not know about winning, but he did not play at home in Novi Sad. The previous defeat was experienced by Partizan in mid-September, when it was 3-0 for the Black and White. The star, on the other hand, is Jurand the seventh tied league triumph after failure in the derby. A special motive for the players will be the fact that Vladan Milojevic can enter the history of the Red Star as only the second coach, after Miljan Miljanic, who achieved a three-digit victory on the Red and White bench. The meticulous expert is currently at level 99.
14:53
