مصرف لبنان: لا ندرس فرض قيود رسمية على رؤوس الأموال
02 Nov 2019 by العربية.نت- وكالات
أكد حاكم مصرف لبنان المركزي، رياض سلامة، السبت، أن المصرف لا يدرس فرض قيود رسمية على رؤوس الأموال.
كما أوضح أن إعادة فتح البنوك بعد أسبوعين من الإغلاق لم يسبب أي مشكلة في أي بنك.
وكان رئيس جمعية مصارف لبنان، الدكتور سليم صفير، أكد في وقت سابق السبت لوكالة ""رويتزر"" للأنباء أن القطاع المصرفي لم يشهد أي تحركات غير عادية للأموال في أول يومين من إعادة افتتاح البنوك أمام الجمهور بعد أسبوعين من الإغلاق بسبب الاحتجاجات.
وأضاف صفير ""كان رد الفعل هو تقريبا ما توقعناه وترقبناه. وعلى الرغم من ذلك، كان الناس يطرحون الكثير من الأسئلة وقدمنا أكبر قدر ممكن من التطمينات"".
عدم الأخذ بالشائعات
كما أكد رئيس أن المصارف تتابع متطلبات وحاجات المواطنين، منوهاً ""بوعي الشعب اللبناني وتحليه بالمسؤولية"". وأضاف أن الجمعية ""مستعدة لاتخاذ الإجراءات الضرورية للحفاظ على سير العمل بشكل طبيعي""، متمنياً على المواطنين ""عدم الأخذ بالشائعات وتقصي الحقائق من المصارف مباشرة أو من الجمعية"".
يذكر أن يوم الجمعة فتحت المصارف اللبنانية أبوابها بعد إغلاق دام أسبوعين، وسط مخاوف من أن يهرع الناس لسحب أموالهم وتحويلها للخارج بسبب حالة الغموض السياسي والاقتصادي، لاسيما في ظل التظاهرات التي انطلقت منذ 17 أكتوبر. وقال مصرفيون وعملاء في حينه إنه لم تُفرض قيود رسمية على حركة رؤوس الأموال لكن عملاء واجهوا قيوداً جديدة على التحويلات للخارج والسحب من الحسابات بالدولار.
وكانت بنوك لبنان أعادت فتح أبوابها الجمعة لتوفير ما وصفته بـ""الحاجات الملحة""، ودعت جمعية المصارف العملاء أن يضعوا في اعتبارهم ""مصلحة البلد""، في ظل مخاوف كبيرة من إقبال المودعين الكبار والصغار على سحب ودائعهم. وقال بيان صادر عن الجمعية إنها تأمل أن ""يتفهم العملاء الوضع القائم، وأن يتجاوبوا إيجابا لخدمة مصالحهم ومصالح البلد في هذه المرحلة الاستثنائية"".

From the journalistic bench
UCR: the club of friends and relatives of Castillo

02 Nov 2019, 00:07

The sequence, if applied, is known by the radicals. And do not cheat.First the game is taken, with a single list or by canceling, via subterfuges, the rivals who intend to cross the road. The next procedure is to close, with strong locks, the doors of the committee and, one month before the closing of lists for provincial or national elections, they are reopened for a convention, orchestrated in advance, which empowers the central committee to designate elective candidates . Of internal democracy, not to mention.
The pendular game did not invent it, but it has been practiced without variations by the national senator Oscar Castillo for three decades.That way he reserves the most precious charges for himself - governor, national deputy, national senator, etc. - and distributes the package of local candidacies and candidacies among their intimates, be they friends or faithful followers.
This ""Cosa Nostra"" club, with the strategy explained, does wonders in politics. Its president lives on the privileges and the rest of the board is not far behind in making profits. Each and every one - legislators of different categories - amass fortunes without even perspiring the shirt and nobody claims anything from them. On the contrary, they even applaud them for defending ""the laurels we knew how to get.""
The only problem is that the powerful Civic Front that was built in the 90s and came to occupy irreducible positions is increasingly small and less influential. In the chambers and deliberative councils of the province the miné dances to the rhythm of Peronism and its territoriality is reduced to 4 intentions over a total of 36. Let's say 10%. The remaining 90% is from Peronism (and allies) that dragged 20 years (1999-2011) into misery and impotence.

“The pig's food”
For these things to happen in a game that has about 130 years of existence, the concurrence of several factors is necessary.
On the one hand, there is no debate and Castillo, via puppets like Luis Lobo Vergara or Alejandro Páez, moves comfortably from the shadows. On the other hand, that leaders who have a history and threaten to fight, are a kind of hybrids of politics that remain in short-haunted bravado. At the moment of truth, the Brizuela del Moral, the Pernasetti, the Ricardo Guzmán, the Acuña, to name the last ones who promised to go “for all or nothing”, go back and leave the field free to the person in charge of the armed elections They inevitably lose beforehand.
For these 2019 elections, beyond names that did not generate expectations, almost childish mistakes were made, such as putting a candidate for governor with little public knowledge about the time (how is it understood that Roberto Gómez has taken about 40% in an intern and lower to 33% in a general?) and not harmonize a discourse of institutional strength, as it would be to present a credible program with ideas beyond those of the government in office.
Things were done backwards. All the time they appealed to baseness and wanting to take advantage by accusing the rival of allowing the installation of drug trafficking or using public funds in the financial timba, a mechanism installed by Macri nationwide. Part of this libretto, fallacious and liar, was another “great idea ”of the senator in chief. After the failure of the PASO, where the candidates obtained stunted dividends, they appealed to a morbid Brazilian consultant who proposed to go back in time. Thus we saw how the Morales Case was to be updated and revived the martyrdom of María Soledad, which they used politically for more than 20 years. They intended to continue doing so through characters like “Joyi” Oliva, the second former national deputy candidate who, coincidentally, blindly responds to Castillo.
By the way, the sorcerer with whom they sought the miracle of the 90s coincided fully with Castillo, a politician who conceives that you only come to power by defamation and, if you talk about drugs, much better. He already did it in the past when, among several others, he aggravated Julian Williams Kent, Guillermo Luque, Francisco Gordillo and could never offer a test to Justice.

Perfect cartoon
Luckily for the old radical trunk, in the midst of stunned silences, voices emerged that caricatured the character who turned the UCR into a family good. One was on the lips of a national deputy, José Alberto Furque. Having no interest in returning to party sources, he masterfully painted the figure of Castillo.
He wondered how we can justify that Mr. Castillo, for 25 years, occupy a bench in the National Congress and that he has never worked ?, from which he said, with a hint of irony, “let's say he has a virgin toga because he is a lawyer, but he was never seen working in the Courts. ” He completed the caricature in this way: ""live from the State and business with the State."" He also had ink for the UCR: ""his conduct was liquefying what was a force of moral and ethical protection in favor of the Republic.""
It's all about Furque. For what he was as a politician (one of the most notable feathers and great speaker of Congress) and because he is not encouraged by any objective within the party he knew about the military.
The other voice that echoed in the radical eardrums was of the young Paola Bazán, of solid performance as provincial deputy. Without too many laps, he pointed to and blamed Castillo for the party tragedy: “The person in charge is the political shipowner and we all know that the political shipowner is the senator Castillo, who comes to the province every so often, especially in electoral times and at the time of campaign lets go of our hand. The proclamation, assemble the list for convenience and according to sectoral and private interests, ""said Bazan and finished by saying"" there are missing opposition ideas. ""
Furque was not answered, nor will they do it because they have no moral stature to do so. Paola, from the JR, was returned with low-stanza charges, which helped break the block or included dead people on an internal list that did not compete. It is about two nonsense with the indelible seal of castillism.
Final conclusion. It's not the fault Castillo. He takes profits in the absence of courage from a thymus leadership and not committed to noble causes. He will do it again in 2020 when the party cadre (and its own bank) has to be renewed. There will be a single list, at the head of a puppet such as Páez, a comfortable convention, with an adjusted quorum, and appointment of positions among the friends of the club.
It will be the scheme to lose in 2021 and reduce the UCR to a minimum. We anticipate the same in 2018 thinking of 2019. Of course, we are not mistaken.
