There is a 12% difference between the liter of premium and super naphtha and there is an increase in CNG
In most of the suppliers the CNG has a price of $ 23.50 per m3, but that value will have an adjustment due to the increase in costs in the vending machines.

The increase between $ 2.30 and $ 2.50 per liter that fuels in Santiago del Estero had led to the widening of the gap between premium and super naphtha so that the difference between the two is just over $ 6 per liter and reaches up to 12% which in the suppliers estimate that there will be a growing demand for the super.
From the Chamber of Vending indicated that this increase will be followed by another in the second half of the month, but also noted that the price of the m3 of CNG will also have an increase in the coming days.
""We estimate that before the end of the month, in the second fortnight there will be another increase similar to the current one to enter the price recovery stage, we estimate that approximately 60% of the value will be recovered with which we would be talking about a 12 or 13%, ”said Pedro Llorvandi, president of the local institution.
He also pointed out that the CNG that “I do not think that it will remain the same in its prices because the second installment of the increases in what are the wage negotiations already begins, that is going to impact, they also impacted the last authorized increases in services , which come from July and August with which the CNG colleagues will see what the cost structure they will carry out ”.
However, he indicated that ""it is another fuel that is late in its price and rising costs which will also increase although the percentage and its date of application is not clear.""
He stressed that “without a doubt as it was happening, the gap between the price of super and premium gasoline continues to be high, which will deepen the demand and that gap that today is $ 6, will reach $ 10 in the time"".
