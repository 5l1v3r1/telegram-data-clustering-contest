DRC: Army announces ""large-scale"" operations in Beni
02 Nov 2019, 00:54 by RFI

The Armed Forces of the DRC have announced that they have launched since Wednesday so-called ""large-scale"" operations against local and foreign armed groups active in the east of the country. Through this initiative, they hope to put an end to the insecurity in this region weakened by years of armed conflict.

The government announces that it has almost doubled the size of the army in the region. Today there are about 21,000 soldiers in Beni against nearly 11,000 previously, or one-tenth of the FARDC strength.
According to a military source, troops who have spent more time in this part of the country will gradually be relieved. This was one of the problems raised by civil society, the maintenance of tired contingents after months or even years of operations or waiting in the forests of the territory of Beni.
The army also speaks of greater involvement of its General Staff. President Felix Tshisekedi had promised to transfer the staff there. Its leader, Army General Célestin Mbala, is currently in the region, as is the commander of the 3rd FARDC defense zone, General Fall Sikabwe, posted to Kisangani. It remains to be seen how long they will stay, asks a deputy.
One of the recurring problems of the army in Beni was logistics, with soldiers sometimes signaling supply disruptions. FARDC supports having strengthened their capacities in this area. A military source even speaks of a reinforcement in the air.
The civil society of Beni said to wait to decide, she said expect concrete actions, scalded by previous announcement effects. It must be said that, more than once, the Congolese army managed to take the positions attributed to alleged Ugandan rebels ADF before losing them.
These operations are a unilateral initiative of the Congolese army, the Monusco has not been solicited or associated. However, the UN mission promises its support if it is requested and advocates for the respect of human rights and the protection of civilian populations during these operations.
