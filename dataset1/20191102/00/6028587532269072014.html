      <p>The endless possibilities of free agency can get so engaging that it’s easy to forget teams also have to worry about hanging on to what they have. When Gerrit Cole and Anthony Rendon are out there for the taking, who wants to worry about re-signing Logan Forsythe or navigating arbitration with Joc Pederson?But those are among the big decisions that will be facing teams as they head into the off-season. Here, before teams get to the addition part of the hot stove season, Forbes.com’s SportsMoney contributors highlight the likely subtractions across the majors.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><b>Player Likeliest To Leave:</b> The Braves could see an exodus this winter, with Brian McCann retiring; Josh Donaldson, Julio Teheran, Chris Martin, Billy Hamilton, Adeiny Hechavarria and Francisco Cervelli all perhaps hitting the market; and Luke Jackson, Nick Markakis and Ender Inciarte trade candidates. But Dallas Keuchel is almost certain to depart for greener pastures. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschlossberg/2019/10/31/atlanta-braves-mlb-free-agency-john-donaldson/"><i>Read more on the Braves’ off-season outlook from Forbes contributor Dan Schlossberg</i></a><i>.</i></p>

      <p><b>Player Likeliest To Leave:</b> The Marlins almost certainly won’t pick up Starlin Castro’s $16 million club option.

      <p><b>Player Likeliest To Leave:</b> The Mets didn’t bother to move proactively with Zack Wheeler, and now he should field multi-year offers from elsewhere.

      <p><b>Player Likeliest To Leave:</b> Fernando Rodney allowed a grand slam in Game 4 of the World Series, not to mention three walks and another hit as he retired only one batter.

      </h3>
      <p><b>Player Likeliest To Leave:</b> Addison Russell will be shopped but seems a likely non-tender. His domestic violence suspension and disappointing season at the plate point toward a fresh start elsewhere. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/philrogers/2019/10/31/chicago-cubs-mlb-free-agency-kris-bryant-javier-baez/"><i>Read more on the Cubs’ off-season outlook from Forbes contributor Phil Rogers</i></a><i>.</i></p>

      <p><b>Player Likeliest To Leave:</b> Kevin Gausman pitched decently after being claimed off waivers in August, but it wouldn’t make much financial sense for a smaller-market franchise to spend potentially eight figures on a middle reliever. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnperrotto/2019/10/31/cincinnati-reds-mlb-free-agency-didi-gregorius/"><i>Read more on the Reds’ off-season outlook from Forbes contributor John Perrotto</i></a><i>.</i></p>

      <p><b>Player Likeliest To Leave:</b> After posting a 2.39 ERA in 25 appearances for the Brewers after a trade deadline deal, Drew Pomeranz is likely to draw interest as he hits the open market for the first time.

      <p><b>Player Likeliest To Leave:</b> Even though the Pirates are likely to exercise Starling Marte’s option, it is no guarantee he will be on the 2020 opening-day roster.

      <p><b>Player Likeliest To Leave:</b> Even after some payroll-clearing trades, Jake Lamb and Steven Souza Jr. would likely make too much in arbitration to be brought back. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackmagruder/2019/10/31/arizona-diamondbacks-mlb-free-agency-david-peralta/"><i>Read more on the Diamondbacks’ off-season outlook from Forbes contributor Jack Magruder</i></a><i>.</i></p>

      <p><b>Player Likeliest To Leave:</b> Wil Myers became the face of the franchise in 2017 when his contract was extended in a $87 million deal, which at the time was the largest in team history, but he’s been a disappointment since.
