En máxima alerta se encuentran las autoridades en el Cauca tras el asesinato de un funcionario de la Unidad Nacional de Protección, UNP, situación que prendió las alarmas por un posible ‘plan pistola’ contra las personas que laboran en los esquemas de protección de líderes sociales, campesinos e indígenas del departamento.
En un primer momento, en Altamira del sector de Cerro Tijeras, jurisdicción rural del municipio de Suárez, al norte de departamento, fue secuestrado el escolta Fabián Eduardo Rivera Penagos, luego que sujetos armados arribaran a hasta la casa donde permanecía, de donde lo sacaron violentamente.
Luego, y por información de la comunidad, el cadáver de esta persona fue encontrado por la guardia indígena entres las localidades de La Betulia y Asnazú.
Según explicó el compañero de labores de la víctima, esta se encontraba de permiso, aprovechando el momento para visitar a la novia en Altamira, donde pernoctó. Ahí fue que se presentó el plagio.
“El escolta que murió era integrante del esquema de seguridad de guardia indígena y presidente de la junta de acción comunal La Despensa de Toribío, Bernardo Ciclos”, indicó por su parte el comandante de la Policía en el Cauca, coronel Rosemberg Novoa.
Fabián Eduardo Rivera Penagos era oriundo de San Francisco, zona rural de Toribío.
Después de esto, se conoció del el ataque armado a otro integrante de la UNP, quien se movilizaba en una camioneta, la cual terminó impactada por disparos de arma de fuego. El funcionario salió ileso de esta situación, presentada al nororiente del Cauca en medio de la situación que sucedió con el ataque a los integrantes del Resguardo de Tacueyó, donde cinco comuneros fallecieron.
Mientras esto sucede, indígenas salieron hoy a la vía Popayán-Cali o Panamericana para realizar ‘plantones’ como forma de rechazar el asesinato de sus compañeros en los municipios del norte del Cauca así como en otras localidades del país.
Por un momento, y según periodistas de Piendamó y Santander de Quilichao, la protesta se adelanta en el sector de La Agustina, donde los nativos bloquearon el paso de vehículos por un momento. Ahora, se encuentran apostados a los lados de esta importante carretera.

""Tuk Tuk"" revolutionaries .. The story of the landless vehicle in Baghdad
02 Nov 2019 by Baghdad - Abdul Qader Janabi
Like wildfire, the name ""tuk-tuk"" has spread to Baghdad during the past days of demonstrations, until the permanent companion of Tahrir Square, and indeed all the rising squares in Iraq.
An image or video is not without its presence. Even the demonstrators in the fields began to cheer for these small vehicles when they appeared, salute their drivers by chanting the phrase ""Alam and God knows, Abu Tuk Tuk Alam."" In a sign that they lift the head.
Some also waved banners that read, for example: To the owner of the tuk-tuk, Khod Qalbi and Ashweh, ""and other phrases that were common among Iraqis, as a tribute to those small vehicles and their drivers.
Poor segment
Most of the drivers of the tuk tuk belong to the poor social class. They operate from early morning until sunset in Baghdad, and the low prices received by drivers do not exceed ten thousand Iraqi dinars ($ 8).
""Tuk-tuk"" are small vehicles that entered Iraq recently, and spread in the areas of religious tourism, most notably in the city of Kadhimiya in Baghdad, in order to get rid of the congestion in the public streets, due to ""security"" or sudden breaks.



""Transporting the injured is a moral imperative""
At the end of October 1, Iraqi security forces stepped up their cruelty to peaceful demonstrators in Tahrir Square in central Baghdad to break the protests that lasted for hours. Security personnel fired live ammunition that killed 107 people and injured about 6,000 others.
The lack of ambulances, and the inability to reach the flashpoint areas of the protest yards, highlighted the activities of tuk-tuk drivers, where drivers faced sniper fire and tear gas canisters, in order to save the victims who fell inside the demonstration yards.
Commenting on the rescue of the wounded, Walid al-Amiri, one of the tuk-tuk drivers, said that ""the motivation that led me to rescue and to face the dangers that could lead to my life is the human preacher. He pointed out that ""his presence in the demonstrations is a national and moral duty.""
""Many of the tuk-tuk drivers are not paid for their services in protest squares, but awareness of the value of the human being protesting against the performance of the ruling authority has led us to do so,"" he told Al-Arabiya. ""The ministries in charge of caring for the unemployed do not know about our conditions."" Tired living, not knowing how to operate and what miserable financial imports we get during a month. ""
""The segment of drivers of these vehicles, a destitute segment, suffers from governmental and social negligence as well. Many people are alarmed by our profession because we are driving without traffic system and crowding out private cars, but what we do, we have nothing else,"" he said.
""The Tuk Tuk Revolution""
While live bullets, heavy tear gas canisters and fear of casualties have left some of them unnecessary, some young people have sometimes retreated, but tuk-tuk vehicles and their spontaneous role in the protests have made many people secure their lives in the presence of young rescuers. Moments of crisis.
Civil activist Khaled al-Nassar told Al-Arabiya.net that ""many of us owe these young people, a poor youth, but rich in conscience and national awareness, and this was manifested through their humanitarian and national activities, which are witnessed by all"". With them increased because they refuse to take money when transporting the demonstrators in their vehicles, knowing that they need it for their poor condition. ""
He pointed out that ""most of the wounded in hospitals in the capital, Baghdad, were transported via tuk-tuk cars, because the ambulances of the Ministry of Health, do not have a practical system, but are part of the problems of the Ministry of Health, which does not deal with the injured, although dealt with them negatively, ie. Without the care or serious medical attention, ""stressing that"" the demonstrators are proud of the drivers of these vehicles, as many of the liberation demonstrators called the current demonstrations, (the revolution of the tuk-tuk), in honor of this national honorable sacrifice. ""

Invitations to be covered by a financial grant
Tuk-tuk drivers express a long tale of pain, agony, poverty and the armies of the unemployed, left behind by the current system of quotas, which failed to absorb the rising young potential and forced thousands of young people to seek work by any means possible, including the use of tuk-tuk wheels. Cheap price ranges between ($ 300-500), so many people in Baghdad are annoyed by the large spread in the main streets and harass modern cars hampered by those wheels that spread rapidly in two years in the capital.
But its role has changed dramatically as it roams the streets of recent demonstrations, transporting supplies and food to the demonstrators and transporting those unable to walk in the streets free of paramedics, usually absent in times of crisis, and the large crowds that hinder their movement.
Tuk-tuk youth have become increasingly popular for the type and frequency of sacrifices they make daily and around the clock as they travel from their neighborhoods east of Baghdad, where they live below the poverty line.



Tuk tuk cars in Baghdad
Demonstrators in the fields began to cheer for these vehicles when they appeared, and salute their drivers by shouting the phrase ""Alam and God knows, Abu Tuk Tuk Alam."" In a sign that they lift the head.
Jabbar al-Ghazzi, an Iraqi writer and journalist, called on the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs to ""give priority to the owners of these vehicles when distributing monthly grants to the unemployed,"" pointing out that ""this segment is already unemployed, because the work does not fill a breath or bring decent living Decent, for twice their monthly revenue and a minority used by people on normal days. ""
Al-Ghazzi told Al Arabiya.net that ""most of the people I installed with them refused to take the money when I went to Tahrir Square in Baghdad, as if they protest with us their humanity and their own way, which was prepared by the ideal way, when making his living in the service of demonstrators on the corrupt power.""
