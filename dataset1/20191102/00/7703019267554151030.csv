How to get a ticket in business paying the same as in economic
According to Bloomberg, executives can use a trick up their sleeves to upgrade without overpaying.
02 Nov 2019 by El Cronista
Traveling in Executive Class - or Business Class - is a luxury reserved for few: the average tickets are around US $ 3,000 and in some cases they even triple the value of seats in Economy Class.
Of course, the differences are notorious: the food is different, the seats are comfortable, the attention is more personalized.
There are few companies that have in their corporate policy include passages in Executive Class since people arrive at more rested destinations and the extra space and connectivity amenities allow them to advance work in the air.
For the rest trying to make an upgrade, the options are rather few: try to locate a specific offer, have a loyalty card that proves to be a frequent traveler or get a job with those benefits.
But according to author Tilly Bagshawe there is an extra trick.



In an interview with Bloomberg, the author of books such as ""Adored"" and ""Murder at the Mill"" revealed her secret to an upgrade without overpaying. She, who travels about 100,000 miles a year as revealed in this interview, says that two words are enough to achieve it: ""Revenue Management.""
""Not everyone knows that there is an area in the major airlines responsible for ensuring that all airline tickets are sold. This area is called Revenue Management and is the one to ask for when buying a ticket by phone but it is especially useful if he buys it online, ""explains the author.
He confesses that talking to Revenue Management and asking if they released seats for upgrades with miles has been a successful strategy in 100 percent of cases. ""If they have 20 unsold seats, there is no better strategy than to ask them when they will release them. Almost always, under pressure from the client, they access. Or, in the worst case, they tell you to call tomorrow,"" he acknowledges.
For those who try and do not succeed, there are options: a microphone of the future, fully connected and with luxury beds, already sells its tickets for US $ 80 and promises to replace the Executive Class in short distances.
