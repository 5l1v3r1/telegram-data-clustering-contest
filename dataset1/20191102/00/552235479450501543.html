      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T00:01:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Laura Paterson</a></address>
      <p>An <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/support-scottish-independence-rises-50-20569640">independent Scotland</a> is "within touching distance", Nicola Sturgeon will tell a pro-independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday.</p>
      <p>She said "another clear win" for the SNP at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/christmas-general-election-after-mps-20752839">General Election next month</a> will "bring it even closer still".</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-national-party">SNP</a> leader is the headline speaker at the event in George Square, her first speech at an <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/indyref-2">independence </a>rally since the 2014 independence referendum campaign.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Ahead of the event, she said: "A vote for the SNP is a vote to escape Brexit, and to put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands - not Boris Johnson's.</p>
      <p>"This election really is the most important one Scotland has faced in modern times.</p>
      <p>"So much is on the line - people are completely fed up with the mess at Westminster.</p>
      <p>"But George Square will be packed today as people from all backgrounds join together to demand a better future for Scotland.</p>
      <p>"An independent Scotland is closer than it has ever been. It really is within touching distance.</p>
      <p>"What is needed now is another clear win for the SNP to bring it even closer still - so vote SNP on December 12th to secure Scotland's right to decide."</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/nicola-sturgeon-warns-snp-rebels-20567725">First Minister used her speech to the SNP conference in Aberdeen</a> to insist a second independence referendum "must" take place in 2020.</p>
      <p>She will formally request the power for Holyrood to stage a referendum from Prime Minister <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> before the end of this year.</p>

      <p>A section 30 order - which the UK Government has so far refused to consider - would mean a legally binding ballot could be held.</p>
      <p>Also speaking at the rally, organised by Scotland's only pro-independence daily newspaper The National, are fellow SNP members Mhairi Black MP, Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf and Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie.</p>
      <p>Mr Harvie will appeal for an "inclusive" campaign for a second independence referendum to protect people from the "hard-right Brexit project".</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of the rally, he said: "The cause of Scottish independence must be broad and inclusive. Our diversity is our strength.</p>
      <p>"Those people who are still to decide need to be offered a positive, hopeful vision about how we can live in a fair, equal, sustainable country, and why independence will help."</p>
