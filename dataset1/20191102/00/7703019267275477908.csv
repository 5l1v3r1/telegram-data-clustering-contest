The challenges of the new political cycle
02 Nov 2019 by Opinion
The elections that enshrined a new government that will assume on December 10 were left behind. The short-term challenges are around, in order to implement an economic stabilization program that breaks expectations and puts the most important macroeconomic variables on paths of normality and reasonableness.
A credible economic team and a consistent program, which deals with the economy as a whole, will be a necessary condition to find a stabilization path: inflation that in 2019 will be around 60%, closed voluntary credit markets, falling demand for money that it mistrusts the local currency, nominal interest rates at very high levels that do not encourage productive investment, high fiscal deficit, very high fiscal pressure and product fall in the last two years. The task is not minor.
An economic program must be a path consisting of fiscal policies (income and expenses), monetary policies (amount of money and interest rate), exchange rate, trade openness, incentives to foreign trade, service fees, relations with the financial sector, among other fundamental variables of the economy.
In the short term, the new government will have to face the bottleneck raised by the debt in both pesos and dollars that expires during 2020. On the side of the debt in foreign currency, it must find friendly mechanisms for extension of terms agreed with the creditors , that avoid the fall again in default with the adverse effects that it has for the whole of the Argentine economy.
While the debt in local currency, as the amount of pesos that will be dumped into the economy is enormous, there is a latent risk that deepens a run against the peso, the fall in the demand for money is accelerated and inflation is spiralized .
The arbitration against the dollar that has been done up to this point using the interest rate will also be a determining factor. In the light of the experience of recent years and what can be collected at the international level, any internal price stabilization plan will gradually bring inflation to more reasonable rates in a process of more than three / four years. With this, we will have next year, a still high inflation rate that is estimated to be around 40% per year.
Consequently, the interest rate can no longer be used as an element to avoid the flight to the dollar by offering sidereal rates, but it must be maintained at positive real rates that encourage savings and make individuals and companies channel it into the formal financial system. .
The service fee will be another determining element in short-term stabilization. On the one hand, the mechanisms for adjusting tariffs will surely be reviewed, but neither can it be allowed to fall into tariff arrears that break agreed contracts or, worse, plunge us back into the shortage of services due to the lack of clear signals for the investment. Much more so that one of the sectors called to lead the recovery of Argentina in the long term is directly related to the exploitation of unconventional oil areas.
Finally, salary negotiation is going to be another point in this set of immediate challenges for the next government. The real salary has deteriorated in the last two years and it is expected that there will be strong union pressure for the recomposition of them. The difficulty lies in the fact that, in a recessive economy, with the fall of the product in the last two years and also projected for the next year, it is hardly possible in the short term to recover the real wage the lost ground at the risk of significant increases in the salary nominal, end inexorably moving to prices.
Consequently, as described, the task of the incoming government, to stabilize in the short term, will be a narrow gorge, not devoid of great uncertainties and in need of great solvency, consistency and experience in managing the economy.
DO NOT LOSE OF VIEW
THE LONG-TERM
To stabilize the short term, it should not make us lose sight of the fact that to avoid the falls in the recurrent crises such as those that affect Argentina and that are a common place when analyzing the economic cycle of our country. That is, start answering the question posed by R. Cortés Conde in the opening paragraph of this article.
We have the painful record of being perhaps the only country of the modern era, which, having been rich, ended up poor after a century. Almost all nations (with the exception of sub-Saharan Africa), in the period from the 80s of the last century to the present, have reduced their poverty levels. In the words of the president of the World Bank Group JimYongKim: “In the last 25 years, more than 1 billion people have managed to get out of extreme poverty, and currently the world poverty rate is the lowest that is recorded. This is one of the greatest achievements of humanity in our times. ”
Argentina has not been able, with democracy, to bring an improvement in these figures. At least one third of the population is hit by this scourge, and although there is movement around this average, we are not able to consistently lower this index. Recurring crises, when they pass, leave as geological layers, a new number of people doomed to poverty or to their worst face, which is homelessness. What to do then?
The first thing is to look in the mirror of those who grew consistently in the last 30 years. In more or less, all the countries that grew did so on the basis of two premises: solid institutions that respect individual freedoms, property rights, contracts and a strong investment in human capital.
To do this and as a statement, we must undertake long-term sustainable reforms in at least four sectors:
a) A reform of the State, which returns fiscal strength and in turn modernizes state institutions so that the state truly reaches the most needy sectors;
b) A reform in the pension system, which returns intertemporal strength to the retirement system. Assuming that the current situation of the labor market, life expectancy, general health of the population are substantially different at the time it was designed around the middle of the last century;
c) Labor reform that lowers the very high cost of the system to incorporate personnel, that allows the access of the youngest to their first job, that promotes training and rewards productivity;
d) Foreign trade reform. We are one of the most closed countries in the world in terms of imports and exports in relation to its production. Competitive gains are obtained when we can relate commercially to the world: sell them and buy them. We must assume, if we want to belong to the developed world, that this world is a globalized world. Where trade flows of goods and services predominate through country-to-country agreements or between regions.
Until a few decades ago the wealth of nations was a strictly material wealth. The stock of physical capital plus the relative endowment of natural resources explained the growth of capital per worker and this, towards increasing productivity, made countries more competitive, grew in commerce and that was a virtuous circle, which, despite Some movements in the economic cycle, the long-term trend was highly positive.
The current world is a world where the idea that ""knowledge is wealth"" prevails. In light of this new paradigm, we have seen countries lacking natural resources, located in practically inhospitable areas, far from the most important centers of consumption.
JimYong Kim concludes “However, in order for us to end poverty no later than 2030, we need many more investments, especially in strengthening human capital, to help promote the inclusive growth that will be required to reach the rest of the poor. For your sake, we can't fail. ” In short, Research and Development and Freedom. l
