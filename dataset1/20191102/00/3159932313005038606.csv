02 Nov 2019

GREENACRES, Fla. (AP) - A teenage girl has died several days after being pulled from the pool of a Florida mobile home park.
A Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office news release says 17-year-old Petrona Corio Reimundo died Friday morning. Another girl, 5-year-old Karla Abitalia Morales Ruiz, was pronounced dead Tuesday night.
Investigators say the girls had been swimming Tuesday afternoon at the Casa del Monte Mobile Home Park in Greenacres. The girls drifted to the deep end of the pool, and neither could swim.
It wasn’t clear how long the girls were in the pool before being pulled from the water.

Paramedics responded and took both girls to local hospitals.

Google buys Fitbit 'wearable' brand for $ 2.1 billion
02 Nov 2019 by The People
Google's parent company Alphabet announced yesterday that it has reached an agreement to acquire smart watch and wristband maker Fitbit in a deal worth $ 2.1 billion. According to Rick Osterloh, director of Google's hardware division, the company aims to drive breakthroughs in the wearable device category by investing in smart watches and health monitors. Founded in 2007, Fitbit was one of the first companies to explore the wearable market early in this decade. Analysts also expect the deal to help Google regain ground in an industry dominated by rival Apple. Owner of Apple Watch, Tim Cook's company ended 2018 with half of its share of the global smart watch market. Although it has a watch operating system, Wear OS, Google has no device of its own. In addition, the platform is not as popular as Android - the world's leading maker of Android phones, Samsung uses its own system, Tizen, in its watches. Acquiring Fitbit can change this game, says Eduardo Pellanda, professor at PUC-RS. ""In addition to being a pioneer in the market, Fitbit was the leading wearable brand for a long time,"" he says. According to the expert, an important bet is the health market, one of the audiences conquered by Apple. Renato Franzin, a professor at the USP Polytechnic School, said, ""Google may have concluded that none of its partners was moving at the speed and quality that it imagined. Now, the company may have products that work."" This is not the company's first effort to try to create a smart watch. By January, Alphabet had already spent $ 40 million on Fossil smart watch technology - in addition to the technology transfer, professionals from the company were hired. Since then, however, no news about a possible Google smart watch has been revealed. The information is from the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo.
