Bulgaria protestează faţă de unele declaraţii „arogante” ale preşedintelui Macron
02 Nov 2019 by Jurnal.md

Bulgaria a protestat faţă de unele declaraţii ""arogante"" ale preşedintelui Franţei, Emmanuel Macron, şi a convocat-o lunea viitoare pe ambasadoarea franceză la Sofia, Florence Robine, pentru a-i transmite nemulţumirea, informează sâmbătă EFE.

Într-un interviu publicat săptămâna aceasta de revista conservatoare ""Valeurs Actuelles"", Macron a explicat că îi preferă ""pe oamenii care vin legal (în Franţa) din Guineea sau Cote D'Ivoire bandelor ilegale de bulgari sau ucraineni"".
Vicepremierul Ekaterina Zaharieva, care deţine şi funcţia de ministru de externe, a cerut trimiterea unei note de protest Parisului şi a convocat-o pe ambasadoarea Franţei la sediul MAE bulgar, a explicat pentru EFE un purtător de cuvânt al diplomaţiei bulgare.
Alt vicepremier bulgar, Krasimir Karakaceanov, care deţine şi portofoliul apărării şi este lider al partidului naţionalist VMRO, a criticat pe reţelele social media declaraţiile ""arogante"" ale lui Macron şi l-a numit reprezentantul ""elitei politice europene"".
EFE aminteşte că Bulgaria este stat membru al Uniunii Europene din 2007.

Column - Thales must be the men's libero in Tokyo
02 Nov 2019 by The People
Unless there is an unexpected detour en route to the Tokyo Olympics, Thales, 30, should be the libero who will defend the Brazilian team at the event. In the last four Olympics the position was in charge of one of the greatest experts of world volleyball: Serginho. Champion of everything with the selection, Serginho had already said goodbye to the green-and-yellow shirt, but he agreed Bernardinho's invitation to return and defend Brazil at Rio 2016. It worked. At 41 he was one of the leaders of the Olympic gold achievement, the second of his career.
Mário Júnior, who played the 2014 World Cup, and Thiago Brendle, who was called up by coach Renan Dal Zotto, lost ground in the national team and Thales gained ground. But not without a bit of distrust. The Taubaté player was never unanimous in position. So much so that for the 2018 World Cup, played in Italy and Bulgaria, Renan chose to take two liberos and take turns on the court. Thales was preferably at the front desk, while Minas player Maique came in to assist in the defense.
With the relay it became clear that Thales still needed to evolve in defense, Maique's specialty. In this year's League of Nations, the Brazilian coach continued to alternate the liberos on the court. There was an opportunity for the athlete to be more tested and to show his full potential. This chance came at the Japan World Cup.
The unbeaten and undisputed title of the Brazilian team had the opposite Alan as the big name. But Thales also stood out. Renan chose to leave him most of the time on the court without relaying with Maique. With this, the libero was effectively experimented and responded accordingly. In statistics was the second best defender of the championship, and had the third best reception. It is no small thing for those who have been heavily charged for some instability in the position. Tested and approved, Thales won the spot in the national team that will defend the Olympic title in Tokyo. Any other nomination of Renan Dal Zotto on the final list for the Games will be a big surprise.
Leia said goodbye to the Brazilian team
Libero of the women's team in the campaign of the Rio Olympic Games, Leia announced that she will no longer defend the shirt of Brazil. Their last competition was this year's Japan World Cup, which ended with the Brazilian in fourth place. The decision of the player of Minas Tennis Club was previously agreed with the coaching staff and makes room for the consolidation of Camila Brait in the post.
The Osasco / Audax athlete had left the squad after being dismissed by Leia in the squad for Rio 2016. Invited by coach José Roberto Guimarães, Camila agreed to return to the Brazilian team. Her return already hinted that she would be the Brazilian libero in Tokyo. Technically, Leia and Camila are the best active libero in Brazil. Suelen, from Dentil / Praia Clube, defended Brazil at the 2018 World Cup, but today appears less likely to go to the Olympics. Hardly Zé Roberto will again cut Brait from the squad on the eve of the Olympic Games. So today she owns the position. And it will probably continue that way, at least until the end of the Olympics.
