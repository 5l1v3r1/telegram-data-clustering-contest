      <p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Authorities are searching for an Ohio ride-sharing driver charged with raping a female passenger.</p>
      <p>The Franklin County Prosecutor’s Office in Columbus said Friday 28-year-old Abdirizak Abdullahi Aden has been indicted on one count of rape.</p>
      <p>The Uber driver is accused of sexually assaulting a 24-year-old woman in April.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Ron O’Brien says Aden picked up the woman, drove to a “random” location at her apartment complex and raped her in the back seat of his vehicle.</p>
      <p>O’Brien says a female Uber driver who had just dropped off a passenger at the complex called 911 after watching Aden pull the victim from his car and drive off.</p>
