      <p>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - A 40-year-old man who attacked a woman as she prepared for a yoga class in downtown Portland has been sentenced to 10 years in prison.</p>
      <p>The Oregonian/OregonLive reports <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jerry-dessources/">Jerry Dessources</a> knocked on the studio’s door, asked to sign up for the class and then attacked the woman on Jan. 4, 2018.</p>
      <p>The Multnomah County District Attorney says the woman kicked, punched and scratched at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jerry-dessources/">Dessources</a>, who continued to assault her, punching her in the face. She broke free when he loosened his grip after she told him the yoga class was about to begin.</p>
      <p>Portland police arrested <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jerry-dessources/">Dessources</a> a few hours after the attack.</p>
      <p>Court documents say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jerry-dessources/">Dessources</a> was indicted but was sent to the Oregon State Hospital for treatment after the court found him mentally unfit to stand trial. He returned from the hospital to face the charges this year.</p>
