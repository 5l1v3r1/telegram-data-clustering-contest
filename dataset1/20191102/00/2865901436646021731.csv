DUEL YEARS! Colossal Triple-Double Collision of Lebron and Luke - to Remember (VIDEO)
What a match

02 Nov 2019


Folks, we're having a duel of the year in the NBA! It's only been two weeks in the much anticipated season, but if it were to end at this point, we really couldn't regret it! Because what Dallas and the Lakers basketball players have put out to us last night, and especially two superstars, Lebron James and Luka Doncic, will be remembered forever! The Lakers celebrated 119-110 after overtime in arguably the best match of the season so far.

A colossal triple-double collision! Thus, in the shortest terms, one can describe the games of one of the greatest of all time and the future MVP of this game! Absolutely everything is packed in four quarters and one extension - brutal basketball, scary moves and the ultimate breathtaking show! Both Lebron and Luke finished the match with a triple-double, but this time, the man who even in the 17th professional season seems to have no intention of stopping any time soon ...
Mavsima was a triumph for literally a hair! Everything was ready to celebrate a new big river at the American Airlines Center, but a Danny Green trio took the last-minute encounter to an extension where Lebron showed a cruel class! It was James who, in the seconds before Green's threesome, pulled the Dallas defense on himself as he went into the breakthrough, then opened up the pass for a shot that extended the spectacle by another five minutes.



The first star of the basketball world finished the game with 39 points (13/23 from the game, 4/9 for three) in forty-two and a half minutes on the court, with 16 assists, 12 rebounds, four steals and one blocked ball! Doncic responded with 31 points (10/23 from the game, 4/9 for three), with 15 assists and 13 rebounds in 38 minutes. He became the youngest player in NBA basketball history with a triple-double of at least 30 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds. Their harsh exchange of shots and hits led to an atmosphere of heat, although the impression was corrupted by the judges whose individual decisions had their effect on the final outcome.
The Mavs opened the match brilliantly thanks to the moody Kristaps Porzingis who scored eight of the team’s opening 20 points. Although he had seven catches, three split balls and four points in the first quarter, Doncic was frustrated by two quick personal errors, which made him go to the bench earlier than planned. The Slovenian Miracle had to wait almost halfway through the second quarter to return to the field. The Mavs then had 11 points (41:30). Luke quickly found his rhythm, tossing two quick baskets, then two free throws, then triple straight into the face of Lebron.



Although he made three personal mistakes, Doncic started the second half at the right pace, although the Lakers then broke away and soon led with 65-63. Lebron brought back the threesome in the face of Luke, which provoked a strong reaction from the audience in the stands.
There was only one force in the extension - Lebron! He scored nine points in the extra five minutes and started with a three-pointer after which Anthony Davis quickly kicked the ball into the basket. The Lakers quickly let everyone know who would take the win in the 10-0 series. Davis accompanied Lebron with 31 points and eight rebounds, while Green added 14 points. At Dallas, Porzingis had 16 points and nine rebounds, and Dwight Powell had 14 points. Boban Marjanovic spent ten and a half minutes on the floor, collecting four points (2/5 from the game) and seven caught balls, with one assist.
