Authorities seek Ohio Uber driver indicted for rape

02 Nov 2019

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Authorities are searching for an Ohio ride-sharing driver charged with raping a female passenger.
The Franklin County Prosecutor’s Office in Columbus said Friday 28-year-old Abdirizak Abdullahi Aden has been indicted on one count of rape.
The Uber driver is accused of sexually assaulting a 24-year-old woman in April.
Prosecutor Ron O’Brien says Aden picked up the woman, drove to a “random” location at her apartment complex and raped her in the back seat of his vehicle.
O’Brien says a female Uber driver who had just dropped off a passenger at the complex called 911 after watching Aden pull the victim from his car and drive off.


Uber said the company will support law enforcement in its investigation.
