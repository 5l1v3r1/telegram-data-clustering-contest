      <p>An 'anti-vaxx' mum has claimed she gave out lollipops tainted with the chickenpox virus to 'trick-or-treaters' on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> .</p>
      <p>Aussie mum Sarah Walker, who claimed to be a registered nurse on her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> profile, shared her plan on a group known as 'Stop Mandatory Vaccination'.</p>
      <p>She explained that her son has contracted chickenpox and would like to 'help others with natural immunity'.</p>
      <p>Her post continued: "We have the packaging opening and closing down pat and can't wait to help others in our community.</p>
      <p>"If anyone else would like some for their children happy to send via post for $1 plus postage to your location."</p>

      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Her message was soon shared to ' <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lightforriley/photos/a.1424777911166319/2294861377491297/?type=3">Light for Riley</a> ', a page dedicated to a baby boy who died from whooping cough four years ago.</p>
      <p>Riley's father, Greg Hughes, wrote in response: "Have you ever seen something that instantaneously makes your skin crawl?</p>
      <p>"The woman responsible for this post is claiming to be a nurse in a Brisbane children's hospital.</p>
      <p>"It's not often I'm lost for words but this just about does it."</p>
      <p>Parents were shocked and left fuming when they read about it.</p>
      <p>'Gerard Vance' said: "Sending a virus by post is domestic terrorism and they should be jailed."</p>
      <p>'Chantal Bos Bosch' wrote: "This is sick beyond words. Those poor kids. Not worthy to be a nurse either. And willingly spreading it to others is potential murder. What a sick individual."</p>

      <p>Mr Hughes went on to report the post to the hospital, the nurse practitioner and the press.</p>
      <p>Yahoo News reported that Walker claims to be a nurse at the 'Royal Children's Hospital, Brisbane' on her Facebook page.</p>
      <p>And Queensland Health, the parent company of the above named hospital commented under the post to confirm there is no such employee under the name Sarah Walker.</p>
      <p>"There are no current or former employees by that name that have worked for Queensland Health as a registered nurse. This is a serious issue and has been referred to police, who are investigation," it stated.</p>
      <p>Walker then replied in her post and blamed the web users for trying to get her fired.</p>
      <p>She said: "The health and well-being of my baby is far more valuable than any job.</p>
      <p>"You say I'm vile an gross like I have done something that hundreds of thousands of parents haven't already done.</p>
      <p>"How many times do you see children dropped off to day care or school when they're clearly sick and contagious?</p>
      <p>"Exactly! And I'm offering life long immunity for the price of a couple of blisters and a few days off school."</p>
      <p>Queensland Health told <a href="https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/kids/police-investigating-after-mum-claims-to-infect-lollipops-with-sons-chickenpox-in-brisbane/news-story/c4e1bfc9e1e06b6bcaecfc1875b52b86">new.com.au</a> that the risk of chickenpox transmission from such tainted lollipops would be extremely low as the virus does not survive long on surfaces.</p>
      <p>If Walker were to be found guilty of food tampering or making false claims to do so, she could face up to 15 years in prison.</p>
