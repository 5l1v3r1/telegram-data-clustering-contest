      <p>JERUSALEM: A Palestinian was killed by Israeli airstrikes on Saturday, the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip said, in an attack launched in response to rocket fire.<br/>Dozens of strikes hit the Palestinian enclave in the early hours, targeting bases of the strip’s Islamist rulers and allied groups, a security source in Gaza said.<br/>The Israeli army said the strikes targeted “a wide range of Hamas terror targets,” including a Hamas naval site, a military compound and a weapons manufacturing site.<br/>Gaza health officials said the 27-year-old killed was among three men wounded in an air strike on a militant training camp and that he had died in hospital. It was not immediately clear whether he was a civilian or a gunman.<br/>The sound of explosions could be heard up and down the impoverished territory, an AFP correspondent said.<br/>A Hamas source said they had fired at the Israeli aircraft carrying out the raids and the Israeli army confirmed fresh “incoming fire” from Gaza.<br/>The strikes came in response to at least 10 rockets fired from Gaza late Friday at southern Israel.<br/>The Israeli army said the country’s Iron Dome anti-missile defense system intercepted eight of the rockets.<br/>The rockets were fired in waves, the army said, with air raid sirens sounding.<br/>One house was hit and damaged, without any casualties, the army said, posting a picture of the damage on Twitter.<br/>It was the second consecutive evening that the army reported rocket fire from the Palestinian enclave, which is ruled by Hamas.<br/>Prior to Thursday, there had been no such reported rocket fire from Gaza since September 12.<br/>In August, a series of rocket attacks from Gaza and Israeli retaliations, as well as border clashes, raised fears of an escalation between Hamas and Israel, as elections approached in the Jewish state.<br/>Those polls — Israel’s second elections this year — took place on September 17, but have yet to yield a new government.<br/>Sworn enemies Israel and Hamas have fought three wars in the Palestinian enclave since 2008.<br/>Analysts say a fourth round remains likely.</p>
