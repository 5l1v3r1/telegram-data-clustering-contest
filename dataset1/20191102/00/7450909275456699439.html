      <p><i>Editor's note: The article has been updated at 4:15 p.m. ET on 11/1/19 to reflect additional information.</i><br/><br/>Although Friday morning started off with a little drama on the scales, the New York State Athletic Commission will not be pulling <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Ultimate-Fighting-Championship-2">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a> middleweight <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Kelvin-Gastelum-74700">Kelvin Gastelum</a> from his matchup on Saturday.<br/><br/>On Friday, Gastelum hit the scales amidst concerns that he would miss weight, and instead came in at 184 pounds, or two pounds below the middleweight limit. While weighing in, <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/ufc-244-weigh-in-kelvin-gastelum-elbow-lean-on-coach">multiple reports</a> from <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/1/20943916/did-kelvin-gastelum-lean-coach-make-weight-ufc-244-rafael-cordeiro-no-way">various outlets</a> came in speculating that Gastelum might have violated a rule by contacting his coach <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Rafael-Cordeiro-422">Rafael Cordeiro</a>. Although the commission did not disqualify him from his bout, they will be seeking a punitive measure -- likely in the form of a fine -- as <a href="https://twitter.com/marc_raimondi/status/1190358215848017921">they have determined</a> that Gastelum did indeed come into contact with his coach while weighing in.<br/><br/>One <a href="https://twitter.com/SubmissionRadio/status/1190287601246363648">such video</a> provided an angle that potentially showed Gastelum resting his elbow on Cordeiro. In accordance with <a href="https://www.dos.ny.gov/athletic/pdfs/2014-2-weigh-in-policy-amended-4-13-17.pdf">NYSAC policy</a>, no athlete may be in physical contact with another person during weigh-in procedures.<br/><br/>The <a href="https://twitter.com/marc_raimondi/status/1190347844462546945">statement from the commission</a> reads as follows:<br/><br/><i>"The Commission has reviewed the footage available to it at this time of Mr. Gastelum's weigh-in. The official weight determination will not be disturbed, and Mr. Gastelum will not be disqualified from competing in UFC 244, as the possible contact indicated in the video cannot be said to have materially impacted Mr. Gastelum's weight to the extent that he would have exceeded the applicable weight limit allowable for competition in the match.<br/><br/>The Commission will continue to review the matter and disciplinary action will be pursued if clear evidence of contact with another person during the weigh-in process becomes evident, as any such contact is a violation of Commission policy."</i><br/><br/>Following that, NYSAC <a href="https://twitter.com/LaMonicaMark/status/1190358781898690561">released an addendum</a>:<br/><br/><i>"The Commission has reviewed the footage of Mr. Gastelum's weigh-in. The Commission has determined that Mr. Gastelum made contact with another person while on the scale, a violation of weigh-in policy. In light of this violation, the Commission will pursue disciplinary action."</i><br/><br/>Gastelum (15-4, 1 NC) will be welcoming <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Darren-Till-73436">Darren Till</a> (17-2-1) to the middleweight division in the co-main event of <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/events/UFC-244-Masvidal-vs-Diaz-76599">UFC 244</a>. Headlining the card will be a welterweight battle for the BMF title between <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jorge-Masvidal-7688">Jorge Masvidal</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Nate-Diaz-11451">Nate Diaz</a>.</p>
