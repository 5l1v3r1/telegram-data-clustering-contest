The Kelvin Gastelum and Darren Till fight, which serves as the co-main for UFC 244, might not have all of the drama of the main event between Nate Diaz and Jorge Masvidal, but it could certainly get interesting.
When Darren Till enters the octagon in Madison Square Garden on Saturday night, November 2, it’ll be the first time the former welterweight will be fighting as a middleweight. Of course, some folks see that as a positive. Till often had trouble cutting weight to make welterweight and at 185 pounds, he might feel more comfortable fighting.
Meanwhile, Kelvin Gastelum has been fighting at middleweight, and is widely considered one of the best in the world. With Gastelum, in other words, we know what we’re getting. But with Till, we have a fighter that’s entering a new weight class after some bad beats at the hands of Tyron Woodley and Jorge Masvidal.
It’s perhaps no surprise, then, that Vegas currently has Gastelum as the clear favorite. And like it or not, it's warranted.
Darren Till has earned his spot in the co-main event at UFC 244. He’s tough, he has a generally good chin, and with only two losses under his belt to Woodley and Masvidal, compared to 17 victories, he’s clearly a tough fighter with plenty of talent.
But in his fight against Masvidal at Fight Night 147, Till looked overmatched. And his quick loss in the second round made some wonder whether it was time for a change, especially after his submission loss to Woodley last year at UFC 228.
It’s also important to keep in mind just how difficult it can be to move weight classes. Sure, Till may be a better fit for middleweight, but he’ll also be a bit heavier than he typically is in fights, and he may not move as swiftly. And even with that bump in weight, there’s no guarantee his chin will hold up against Gastelum’s vicious striking.
Indeed, Gastelum might be one of the best strikers in the middleweight division. And although he lost to Israel Adesanya at UFC 236 in April, it was a close decision loss against one of the best middleweights the UFC has ever seen. It was a loss, but in many ways, it was a victory — and an endorsement of Gastelum’s skills.
There’s little debating that if Till can catch Gastelum cleanly, he has a chance at knocking out his opponent. But actually catching Gastelum with a punch has proven difficult for everyone in the game. And since Till isn’t on the same level as Adesanya, it’s hard to believe he’ll be able to overcome Gastelum.
By the end of the bout, this one could be bloody. And look for Till to put up a good fight for a bit. But before long, it’ll be clear Gastelum is the superior fighter and the one who will have his arm raised with a knockout relatively early in the fight.
UFC 244 kicks off from Madison Square Garden on Saturday, November 2. The main card begins at 10 p.m., but the early prelims begin at 6:30 p.m. ET on ESPN+ pay-per-view.  The $79.98 pay-per-view fight includes a one-year subscription to ESPN+.

Sudanese minister: We have removed the symbols of the isolated regime and we are working to dismantle the ""deep state""
Madani to Asharq Al-Awsat: We seek to change investment laws to make them attractive

02 Nov 2019

Sudanese Minister of Industry and Trade Madani Abbas told Asharq Al-Awsat that his ministry, like the rest of the ministries, has removed many symbols of the ousted President Omar al-Bashir's regime from the state apparatus. In the civil service, as this is one of the most important aspirations and slogans of citizens in the revolution that toppled the regime of Bashir and the dismantling of his state, which lasted for thirty years, enabled him and his followers to fully dominate the state organs. State and its organs, but in For many of the decisions that were taken from outside the state, which created an inappropriate work environment, and the presence of workers with limited efficiency and performance is not commensurate with the challenges facing the country ». Madani explained that the remedy is not only to remove elements of the former regime from positions of responsibility, although their presence drains the resources of the state, but to address the roots of the problem that led to the complete disruption of the rules of the civil service, which made its role very limited. ""The project now is not reforming the state, but rebuilding it and its institutions,"" he said. Indeed, the transitional government agreed to establish the concepts of governance and the rebuilding of state institutions again. '' In addition, the price of goods, and the federal rule weakened by devolving many powers to state governments, without taking into account their central role in the Sudanese economy. Madani pointed to the problems facing export and import operations inherited from the isolated system, namely the fake records - some of which are registered with the names of children - and the lease of import and export records, and the use of non-working names in the field of export and import. Many of the proceeds from the collection of export revenues are a form of circumvention, which makes attempts to recover them useless, before reviewing the commercial register, and to achieve electronic link between the authorities involved in the trade process, and stop the paper records, which is one of the main entry points for He explained that the existing records of the incoming and outgoing operations are unconvincing because legalized smuggling is a big window open for importing and exporting goods in the country. ""Adopting the available figures is inaccurate and unreliable, before combating smuggling."" Madani announced the formation of the National Council for the Development of Exports, in which all ministries of the economic sector participate, to formulate export policies, and is expected to complete its formation next week in conjunction with the start of the season of oilseed exports at the beginning of this month. ""We cannot impose on the exporters mechanisms to prevent them from getting their money, but we are working on adopting rules that encourage exporters to return their money voluntarily,"" Madani said. ""The state seeks to restore confidence in the banking system, while at the same time pursuing policies that do not infringe on the rights of exporters."" According to the minister, his ministry is working to review investment laws, making it attractive and benefits the state. ""There are a lot of investors doing commercial and productive operations, but they do not add anything to the Sudanese economy, and some of them come with weak capitals that benefit from the financing of Sudanese banks,"" he said. That meet the country's need, including the employment of Sudanese labor. In explaining the cessation of livestock exports to Saudi Arabia based on reports from the Ministry of Health, Madani said: «The Ministry of Health has reported to the World Health Organization of the occurrence of cases of Rift Valley Fever, after being informed by the government», and continued: «This may result in economic losses on Madani vowed to sit down with livestock traders to consider mitigating the damage they incur, and to reach out to importing countries for the return of livestock exports, which are very important to the country's economy. The minister pointed out that the industry in Sudan is facing many obstacles, the first of which are laws and legislations, and the high cost of industrial production in which energy plays the biggest role, because many factories resort to using gasoline fuel to cut electricity, which raises the cost greatly, as well as issues related to the migration of skilled labor Madani criticized what he called dumping local markets with cheap goods, their impact on local production, imposing heavy taxes on manufacturers, and conflicting laws, saying they had prompted many investors in China. Ah to stop Alaml.otahd minister to work on the drafting of laws that protect manufacturers and support them, and help to encourage industry-related provision of local raw materials, and encourages industry and protect the country. He promised to review the problems that led to the stoppage of many factories, and to seek alternatives to energy to contribute to the return of the industrial sector to the production process. Madani said his ministry will work to support small and medium industries as the basis for the industrial renaissance that took place in many countries. In all aspects, economic and social, as well as contributing to the increase in the rates of employment. ” According to the minister, the industry is expected to be encouraged in the production areas. ""The state is interested in the manufacture of meat, leather, gum Arabic, oilseeds, and textile industry, in addition to emerging and advanced industries such as iron, cement, medicines and foodstuffs, because they contribute significantly to the treatment of diseases Madani explained that his ministry has initiated the preparation of an ""industrial survey"" to help put Sudan in front of a clearly defined industrial renaissance by the end of the transitional period, stressing that «at the end of the transitional period will be in Sudan Pric industry. The industry in Sudan, unfortunately, has fallen a lot, but set back, but there is now a focus, understanding and the will to develop ». As for the gum Arabic, Madani explained that its export faces many problems, the first of which is that it is ""exported in the form of raw material, and the state's dealings with intermediaries controlling prices, not the end consumer."" Sudan produces more than 80 percent of the world's gum arabic production. ""But the problem he faces is related to politics and administration, which makes his income of gum Arabic in the range of $ 100 million, which is unreasonable."" ""We have started discussions with partners, producers, forest management and companies to deal with gum Arabic as a national economic security project that needs to be fully integrated,"" he said. A conference on gum Arabic was to be held in Sudan, but was postponed more than once. “The postponement of the gum Arab conference is intended to create consensus among partners to maximize the desired returns,” he said. ""If the conference is not held properly, the result will be a disaster for Sudan."" He pointed to the presence of quantities of goods in the Sudanese markets enter unofficially, without controlling the quality or presence of consumer protection, and warned against the entry of goods of low quality and non-conforming, and may cause damage to the consumer.``The transitional government inherited a weak legal environment, '' Madani said. There is a consumer protection law placed on the table of the Council of Ministers for the holiday, which requires traders to put preamble determining the prices of goods to weaken the roles of intermediaries who intervene to raise prices ». The minister pointed to the efforts exerted by his ministry to provide basic commodities at cost, and working on state intervention through policies that restore the cooperative system, and contribute to the establishment of cooperative societies, saying «We agreed with a number of factories to provide basic commodities at reasonable prices, in order to return to the solidarity system in the country» . The minister pointed out that the country's economy suffers from structural defects that cannot be solved in a short period, part of which is related to the decline of the national currency in favor of foreign currencies, especially as Sudan imports most of its needs from abroad.
