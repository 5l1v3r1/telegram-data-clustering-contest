NOTÍCIA
Equipe da ONU chega ao Chile para apurar violação de direitos humanos
02 Nov 2019 by O Povo
O Alto Comissariado das Nações Unidas para os Direitos Humanos (ACNUDH) enviou uma delegação ao Chile para monitorar o comportamento das forças de segurança durante a onda de protestos. O órgão é comandado pela ex-presidente chilena Michelle Bachelet.Cerca de uma centena de representantes de organizações sociais expuseram suas denúncias a quatro delegadas do ACNUDH. Grupos de povos nativos, estudantes e LGBTs fizeram exposições e entregaram documentos às representantes da ONU. A equipe fica no Chile até 22 de novembro.""Fizemos uma exposição, inclusive com fotografias de pacientes que perderam a visão ou até mesmo o globo ocular"", contou o presidente do Colégio Médico, Enrique Morales. De acordo com ele, nas duas semanas de crise, 157 pessoas foram atendidas com lesões oculares por balas ou bombas. Os números tendem a crescer.""Independente da polícia dizer que está tudo bem, temos a certeza, assim como a grande maioria das pessoas que assistiu a essa reunião (com a ACNUDH), que protocolos não estão sendo respeitados"", afirmou Morales.A organização independente Instituto Nacional de Direitos Humanos (INDH) disse, em seu último balanço, que 1.574 pessoas estão internadas por causa de ferimentos em protestos. Foram apresentadas ainda 179 ações judiciais contra agentes do Estado, incluídas 5 por homicídio e 18 por violência sexual.""Em muitas manifestações pacíficas, a polícia usou, por exemplo, balas. É um caso claro de protocolo desrespeitado"", disse o diretor do INDH, Sergio Micco. O órgão registrou mais denúncias de violência policial na atual crise do que em todo o ano de 2018.
