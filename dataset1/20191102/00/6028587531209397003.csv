What’s Next For Scotch Whiskey: A Conversation with Jim Beveridge

Jim Beveridge is Johnnie Walker Master Blender and only the sixth person in the 200-year history of Johnnie Walker to fulfil this role. He leads a team of expert whisky makers in the pursuit of exceptional flavor, as he manages and monitors the unparalleled Johnnie Walker reserves of 10 million maturing Scotch whiskies.
Over his forty years at Johnnie Walker, Jim has become arguably one of the most celebrated whisky makers of his generation. A legacy that this year led to an OBE by Her Majesty the Queen for his outstanding service to the Scotch whisky industry. Recently I sat down with Jim to discuss the future of the Scotch whisky business.
JM: The oldest Scotch whiskies ever released have been in the 70-75 YO range. Is there a practical upper limit to how long a whisky can be aged? Is it just the function of the cask and the environment it is being aged in? Will we ever have a 100 YO Scotch whisky released?
JB: There are certainly some practical limitations to how long a whisky can be aged, simply because the alcohol level in the cask declines over time through evaporation, and eventually it will fall below 40% ABV—the minimum strength for Scotch whisky. When this happens depends completely on the whisky, the cask and the environment—so a 100-year-old whisky could be possible.
JM: Blends of single malts, what used to be called “vatted malts,” have become more common as spirits companies have premiumized their core range of blended whisky. Is this the future of blended whiskies or will these expressions remain one-off offerings in blended whisky brands?
JB: At Johnnie Walker, flavor is king. We’ve therefore always been interested in experimenting with all whiskies—single malts and grain whiskies—in order to explore the full range of flavor available to us. Blends of single malts can certainly be really interesting—Johnnie Walker Island Green Label is a great example; a Scotch crafted exclusively from a palette of only single malts drawn from the four corners of Scotland—Highlands, Lowlands, Speyside and the Islands.
In addition, three of the four whiskies in the Johnnie Walker Black Label Origin Series—Speyside Origin, Highlands Origin and Islay Origin—are also created exclusively from single malts from their respective whisky-producing regions. However, grain whiskies play a pivotal role in some of our most exclusive whiskies. Often, it’s in bringing together different flavors, characters and textures, from both single malts and grains, that you begin to unlock hidden depths in all of the individual whiskies.
JM: Is there a sweet spot where the tradeoff between cost, quality and aging is at an optimal point? Is this consistent across the industry or is this just too dependent on the cask and the distillery?
JB: In general, there are key times for Scotch whisky within the maturation process—when age can have a particularly noticeable impact on a whisky’s flavor or texture. These confluences of time and quality often occur 5-8 years into the maturation process, then again at 12 years, and again at 18 years.
This is how traditional age statements for whisky have come to be—they’ve resonated with whisky makers over decades of craft because they’re often key milestones in a whisky’s maturation. It’s important to note, however, that this isn’t true of all Scotch whisky, it’s a general rule of thumb—and the maturation processes for Scotch whisky are typically much slower and steadier than those of other whiskies from around the world.
JM: The top tier of collectible whisky expressions has seen five times to six times increase in prices over the last two decades. Are these kinds of increases sustainable? What kind of rate of increases are likely over the next 10 years?
JB: I suspect I’m not the best person to speak about economic projections when it comes to collectible whisky. As a whisky maker, my job is to simply make great whiskies that people enjoy drinking. No matter what price a whisky is, we want that whisky to bring delight to whoever buys it—that’s what still gets me out of bed in the morning and fires my imagination and conviction after 40 years in the industry.

JM: Age statements have been a critical element in premiumizing whisky. As the industry moves away from disclosing age statements, what will be the basis for justifying premium pricing? Will it be strictly taste and aroma or will some other factors come into play? Will this just become a marketing issue?
JB: Age can sometimes be a useful signifier of a whisky’s quality, and I don’t envisage age statements ever disappearing from the industry completely. However, age is not something that should be viewed in isolation. As whisky makers, we look to use whisky at their best, and different whiskies are at their best at different times. Johnnie Walker Blue Label is a good example of a premium whisky that isn’t centered around an age statement. Its reputation has been built on the rarity of the whiskies used, the craftsmanship employed in its production, and its remarkable depth of character. 
Only 1 in 10,000 casks in our unparalleled reserves of maturing Scotch whiskies has the richness and character required to be used in the crafting of Johnnie Walker Blue Label. We use irreplaceable, aged casks from long-closed ‘ghost’ distilleries such as Port Ellen, Pittyvaich, Brora and Port Dundas. However, we balance these smooth, deep flavors with younger, more vibrant whiskies to bring layers of effervescent flavor to the Scotch.
JM: Cask finishes now include virtually every variety of sweet/fortified wine, top tier whites and reds from famous producers, casks that have held other spirits, new wood and casks that have held beers and ales. Are we running out of different cask finishing/maturation ideas? What’s left in cask finishes that hasn’t already been tried?
JB: As with every other aspect of the whisky making process, quality is key when it comes to maturation. Quality casks, whether American or European oak, are the most important thing in maturation of Scotch whisky and that is our main focus. With the centuries of knowledge and expertise we have accumulated in our business we have a deep understating of what goes on in a cask and how different whiskies mature differently in different casks over different periods of time. So, we have plenty of scope for flavor experimentation and creation.
Cask finishing is really just another opportunity to play with flavor, but like all maturation the quality of the cask and the quality of the liquid that goes into the cask is the key factor.

JM: Several craft distillers have experimented with “terroir” based whiskies. Generally, this has taken the form of grain specific distillations from particular regions. Is this practice going to become more prominent in the industry or is it going to be limited to just craft distilleries?
JB: As Johnnie Walker Master Blender, I’m not best placed to speak for the industry as a whole, although I would say that terroir based whisky production is still in its relative infancy, and as with any innovation or new technique, we’ll monitor its progress with interest. The conversation around terroir is interesting, but again for us the key consideration is quality.
Terroir can’t be assumed to be a guarantor of quality. The only guarantor of quality is to ensure you have the best quality ingredients—barley, peat and water—the best quality equipment in your maltings, your distillery, your cooperage—and the best quality people with the training, skill, experience and passion to make the greatest whisky on earth.

JM: Whisky production is rising at a much faster rate than consumption; not just in Scotland but also in other whisky producing countries. Are we heading for another whisky loch? Not just in Scotland but all over the world?
JB: At Johnnie Walker, we monitor supply and demand very carefully. There’s been consistent growth in Scotch whisky over the past decade, and we believe there’s plenty of opportunity for global growth in the future. As a whisky-making team, we work carefully with people right across the business to make sure we’re making the right decisions to meet demand, and continue to craft whisky that is savored and enjoyed by consumers.
JM: Pernod Ricard has announced that it is planning to build a malt whisky distillery in China. Any plans to follow suit?
JB: As a Scotch whisky, this isn’t something we at Johnnie Walker are currently considering.
JM: What are the next innovations in the Scotch whisky industry?
JB: I think what’s exciting at the moment is that innovations aren’t only coming from those who make whisky, but also from those who serve and drink it. More and more, we are seeing Scotch being viewed as versatile serve. I think this ‘bar back’ approach will continue to inspire creativity and innovation not just in distilleries and blending rooms around Scotland. We are currently showcasing this versatility of our products with our global Johnnie Walker Highball campaign.
JM: Macallan has announced that they will open their own dedicated boutiques to showcase and retail their whiskies direct to consumers. The first one just opened in Dubai Airport. Do you expect this trend to become more prevalent in the whisky industry? Johnny Walker was one of the pioneers of this trend. Is this a program you are still pursuing?
JB: At Johnnie Walker, we’ve very proud to have pioneered this trend ten years ago, when we opened our first Johnnie Walker House in Shanghai. We’ve evolved that model into retail boutiques in airports around the world over the last few years. We added to this portfolio in November 2018 with the opening of our first experiential retail store on Madrid’s fashionable Calle de Serrano. In addition to housing a special collection of Johnnie Walker whiskies, the exciting new space plays host to a wide variety of immersive experiences, whisky appreciation classes and tastings designed to help visitors explore the world of Johnnie Walker and Scotch in general.
Among the experiences on offer is an interactive hosting area where guests can discover the craft of cocktail-making, a tasting table where they can deep dive into the flavours that lie at the heart of Johnnie Walker, and a personalisation station where visitors will be able to find unique gifts and add bespoke engravings and labels to their purchases.
We’re also working towards opening a flagship Johnnie Walker home in Edinburgh in 2020, allowing us to bring people closer to Johnnie Walker than ever before. Our ambition is to create a visitor experience that will rank not only as one of the greatest whisky attractions of the world, but one of the greatest brand attractions in any industry, putting Scotland at the forefront of the global boom in experiential travel. This new flagship experience will also include a major experiential retail space, with a store front on the main shopping street of Scotland’s capital.
Thank you.
