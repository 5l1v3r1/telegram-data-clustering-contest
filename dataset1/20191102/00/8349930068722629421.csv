Arrest of Adama Sangare: The district mayor about to lose a project of 400 billion FCFA
02 Nov 2019 by bamada.net


The arrest of the capital of Bamako could cost the capital the withdrawal of a 400 billion CFA francs project. His supporters, in a meeting last weekend at the Carrefour des jeunes to demand his release, took the opportunity to discuss the consequences of his arrest.





The rally, it must be emphasized, was organized at the initiative of the support group to Adama Sangaré. He recorded the presence of activists of the Adema / PASJ, notabilities of the Commune III in the image of Tominkorobougou district head, Modibo Ndiaye. In an opening statement read by the spokesman of the Collective, Bakary Doumbia dit Bouh, supporters of the mayor of Bamako, while claiming his innocence, said that a group of lawyers is being formed for his defense .
""Given the presumption of innocence that he enjoys until his guilt is legally established by law, we ask his release at last that he can continue his development actions for the welfare of the population and prosperity of the City of Three Caymans, ""said the spokesman.
Mahamadou Doucouré, one of the supporters of the mayor of the district and candidate of the Abeilles party for the next legislative elections, said that the arrest of the mayor of the district could slow down the many development projects that this one was on the point of implementing.
""In my opinion, some are afraid of Adama Sangaré because he is a good person. It disturbs mainly because it was about to raise a project of 400 billion CFA francs for the development of the city of Bamako. Such arrests will complicate the implementation of this project and as a result the city of Bamako may lose this project of 400 billion CFA francs, ""said Mr. Doucoure. A young speaker deplored the witch hunt launched by the President of the Republic Ibrahim Boubacar Keita against his first supporters. ""We all know what President Apcam Bakary Togola did in terms of mobilizing President BKI in the countryside. Ditto for Adama Sangaré not only in the hive but also in the district of Bamako, but today these two men are in prison and the one who opposed the candidacy of IBK was promoted minister "", regretted The speaker, noting that the mayor of the district is a victim of a relentlessness that does not say his name for the simple reason that he is not the only one to be quoted in the report of the Auditor General.
In short, the Collective invites its members to the general mobilization until the liberation of the mayor of the district.
