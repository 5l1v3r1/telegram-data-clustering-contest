      <p>FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) - A Florida man has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for a fatal hit-and-run crash.</p>
      <p>The News-Press reports that 52-year-old Ronald Bray was sentenced Thursday after a jury found him guilty of vehicular homicide.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Bray was driving recklessly on Interstate 75 near Fort Myers in November 2016 when he swerved into the path of another car. The driver of that car, 29-year-old Brooke Fenton, swerved off the roadway and crashed into a semi-trailer that was stopped on the shoulder. Fenton died at the scene.</p>
      <p>Bray continued to drive away, but another motorist followed him and got his license tag number.</p>
