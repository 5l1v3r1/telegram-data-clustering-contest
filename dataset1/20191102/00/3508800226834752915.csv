【圖輯】北海道殖民地：蓋博物館是保護愛努文化，還是賺觀光財？
02 Nov 2019, 00:43 by Lo


我們想讓你知道的是「當我們不被認可，就無法做任何事。」他說若政府決定歸還山林地給愛努人，提供他們打獵、覓食，會讓日本社會難以接受，而且公開的道歉會讓日本人「不舒服」，也是對現代定居於北海道的日本人是一種侮辱。



在日本北海道一個樹木繁盛的湖岸，政府正在興建一棟現代主義的博物館。這棟博物館主要是為了紀念愛努人，因為他們的文化正在快速消逝中。
至今，日本政府花了2.2億美元投資這棟名為「民族和諧象徵空間」（Symbolic Space for Ethnic Harmony）的博物館，可望在2020的東京奧運前完工開放，配合政府鼓勵數百萬觀光客來到北海道旅遊，能增加觀光收益與愛努人曝光度。

博物館的建築群名為「Upopoy」，在愛努語中表示「一起唱歌」之意，包括一棟博物館、一座愛努傳統村落的複製品，因為許多愛努村莊在19世紀就被毀壞。此外，還展示了上百俱愛努人的遺骸，這些遺骸在20世紀被送往各大學進行研究保存。
對於倖存下來的愛努人來說，蓋這個博物館是凸顯愛努人不被日本政府所接受，儘管2008年愛努人已被認證為日本原住民。之所以會這樣想，是因有些人擔心，這座博物館是為了奧運和國際能見度才蓋的，根本不是想保存愛努文化。
愛努族的紋身藝術家Mai Hachiya說：「我認為這有可能就變成觀光勝地，遊客來看傳統舞蹈、表演，把這當成遊樂園。」

愛努人在13世紀左右定居於北海道，打獵、捕魚、信奉自然靈，並有自己的獨立語言。日本政府在19世紀控制北海道後，就迫使愛努人被同化。
2017年的調查顯示，北海道有1.3萬名愛努人，但實際數字一定比這還要多，因為許多愛努人害怕不被認為是日本人，所以移居到其他縣市隱藏自己的民族身分。
官方統計，愛努人學生上大學的比例只有日本人的一半，而且家庭收入也低很多。北海道大學的人類學教授Mai Ishihara說：「社會不太接受愛努人，一直以來都是。這使得很多人選擇隱藏愛努人的身分。」

日本政府2009年簽署《聯合國原住民族權利宣言》，開始思考如何制定新的愛努政策，不過2018年的協商中，愛努人提出的獲得土地權利、更多資金挹注在愛努語言與文化、日本政府需向愛努人道歉的提案，全部都被否決。
日本愛努綜合政策本部負責人小山宏說：「當我們不被認可，就無法做任何事。」他說若政府決定歸還山林地給愛努人，提供他們打獵、覓食，會讓日本社會難以接受，而且公開的道歉會讓日本人「不舒服」，也是對現代定居於北海道的日本人是一種侮辱。
「這將人們把注意力集中到這些不好的事情上，而非我們愛努人的未來。」小山宏補充說。

36歲的愛努族獵人Atsushi Monbetsu說，東京當局的決策，包括正在興建的這座博物館都是沒用的，他從小感受的歧視，讓他決定要更強調自己的血統，並以獵人身分繼續生活；他在用獵槍圍捕鹿群之前，會先燒白樺木屑向愛努神靈祈禱。

在許多愛努人相關的文宣上，會擺上愛努人微笑跳舞的表演照片，並把他們的狩獵採集文化形容成「瀕臨滅絕」。對於日本的政策隻字未提，沒有說政府強迫愛努人改用日本人姓名、講日語等，並把很多愛努人的傳統行為視為非法，例如Hachiya正在推廣的傳統紋身。
36歲的Hachiya同時是名歌手，被要求跟其他愛努表演者一起練習，為的是明年可能有機會在奧運開幕式上演出。
但是，她卻說：「我認為北海道是日本的殖民地。這很難傳達，但你若仔細回想過往，就會得出這樣的結論。」

[Photos] Hokkaido Colony: Does the museum cover the culture of Ainu or earn a tourist?
02 Nov 2019, 00:43 by Lo


What we want you to know is ""When we are not recognized, we can't do anything."" He said that if the government decides to return the forest land to the Ainu, providing them with hunting and foraging, it will be difficult for Japanese society to accept and open. The apology would make the Japanese ""uncomfortable"" and an insult to the Japanese who settled in Hokkaido.



On a tree-filled lakeshore in Hokkaido, Japan, the government is building a modernist museum. The museum is mainly to commemorate the Ainu people because their culture is rapidly disappearing.
So far, the Japanese government has spent $220 million to invest in the museum called ""Symbolic Space for Ethnic Harmony"", which is expected to be completed before the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, in line with the government's encouragement to millions of tourists. Traveling to Hokkaido can increase the tourist income and the exposure of the Ainu people.

The museum's architectural complex is called ""Upopoy"", which means ""singing together"" in the Ainu language, including a museum and a replica of the traditional village of Ainu, because many Ainu villages were destroyed in the 19th century. In addition, the remains of hundreds of loved people were displayed, which were sent to universities for research and preservation in the 20th century.
For the surviving Ainu, the museum is a highlight of the Ainu being not accepted by the Japanese government, although in 2008 the Ainu has been certified as a Japanese aborigines. The reason why I think this way is because some people worry that this museum is built for the Olympics and international visibility. It is not intended to preserve the culture of Ainu.
Mai Hachiya, a tattoo artist of the Ainu, said: ""I think this may become a tourist attraction. Visitors come to see traditional dances and performances and use it as an amusement park.""

The Ainu settled in Hokkaido around the 13th century, hunting, fishing, and believing in natural spirits, and have their own independent language. After the Japanese government controlled Hokkaido in the 19th century, it forced the Ainu to be assimilated.
According to the 2017 survey, there are 13,000 Ainu people in Hokkaido, but the actual number must be more than this, because many Ainu people are afraid not to be considered Japanese, so they moved to other counties and cities to hide their national identity.
According to official statistics, the proportion of Ainu students attending college is only half that of Japanese, and family income is much lower. Mai Ishihara, a professor of anthropology at Hokkaido University, said: ""Society does not accept the Ainu people. It has always been. This has led many people to choose to hide the identity of the Ainu people.""

The Japanese government signed the ""United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples"" in 2009 and began to think about how to formulate a new policy of love. However, in the 2018 consultations, the rights of the Ainu people to obtain land and more funds are focused on the language and culture of Ainu. The Japanese government’s proposal to apologize to the Ainu people was rejected.
""I can't do anything when we are not recognized,"" said Hill Hung, head of the Japan's Ainu Comprehensive Policy Division. He said that if the government decides to return the forest land to the Ainu, providing them with hunting and foraging, it will allow Japanese society. It is unacceptable, and a public apology will make the Japanese ""uncomfortable"" and an insult to the Japanese who settled in Hokkaido.
""This will focus people on these bad things, not the future of our lovers,"" added Hill Hung.

Atsushi Monbetsu, a 36-year-old Ainu hunter, said that the decision of the Tokyo authorities, including the museum being built, was useless. He felt discriminated from childhood and decided to emphasize his lineage and continue as a hunter. Life; before he used the shotgun to round the deer, he would burn the birch sawdust and pray to the god of love.

In many Ainu-related essays, there will be photos of the performances of the Ainu smile and dance, and describe their hunter-gathering culture as ""endangered."" There is no mention of Japan’s policy. It does not say that the government forced the Ainu to switch to Japanese names, speak Japanese, etc., and regarded many traditional acts of the Ainu as illegal, such as the traditional tattoo that Hachiya is promoting.
The 36-year-old Hachiya is also a famous singer and was asked to practice with other Ainu performers in order to have a chance to perform at the Olympic opening ceremony next year.
However, she said: ""I think Hokkaido is a Japanese colony. It is difficult to convey, but if you carefully think about the past, you will come to this conclusion.""
