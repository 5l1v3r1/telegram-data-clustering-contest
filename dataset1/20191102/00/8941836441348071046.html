      <p>HILLSBORO, Ore. (AP) - Cam Humphrey passed for four touchdowns - three of them to Samori Toure - and Montana dominated the second half in a 38-23 victory over Portland State on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Humphrey, making his second start with Big Sky MVP candidate Dalton Sneed sidelined with a right ankle injury, completed 21 of 28 passes for 335 yards. The touchdowns to Toure were 41 yards in the first quarter, followed by 42 yards and 6 yards in the third. The third-quarter scores helped the Grizzlies (7-2, 4-1 Big Sky) overcome a 17-14 halftime deficit. With Montana leading 28-23 at the beginning of the fourth quarter, Humphrey connected with Samuel Akem on a 76-yard scoring pass and a 35-23 lead.</p>
      <p>Portland State (5-5, 3-3) was unable to rally, the Vikings running just six plays in Montana territory during the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Marcus Knight carried 23 times for 106 yards for the Grizzlies, ranked No. 8 in the FCS Coaches Poll. Toure caught seven passes for 140 yards and Akem had 3 catches for 104.</p>
      <p>Davis Alexander completed 20 of 39 passes for 278 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions for Portland State. Mataio Talalemotu caught five passes for 109 yards with a touchdown.</p>
