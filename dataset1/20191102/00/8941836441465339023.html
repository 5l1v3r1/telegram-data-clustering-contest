      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) - Politics can be a bruising business. But President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> plans to get a firsthand look at a different kind of blood sport on Saturday night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> is set to return to his hometown of New York City to attend a high-profile UFC match at Madison Square Garden.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> has long been tight with Dana White, the UFC president. The pay-per-view spectacle is expected to draw several celebrities, including wrestler-turned-actor The Rock.</p>
      <p>It’ll be <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s second sporting event in a week, and it’s an open question how he’ll be received.</p>
      <p>The president was loudly booed days while attending a World Series game in Washington last Sunday.</p>
