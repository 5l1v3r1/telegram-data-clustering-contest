      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/saintes/">SAINTES</a>-MARIES-DE-LA-MER, France (AP) - As a chill wind whips their sodden blue robes, a cluster of Catholic faithful wade gingerly into the choppy Mediterranean, carrying the revered relics of two female saints back into the sea that brought them to southern France.</p>
      <p>The ceremonial procession from the fortress-like Romanesque church of Notre-Dame-de-la-Mer to the sandy beach, 600 yards away, and knee-deep into the water is a centuries-old tradition that attracts crowds of visitors to this small coastal town.</p>
      <p>It celebrates the reputed landfall, in the first decades A.D., of the two Saints Mary - Marie Salome and Marie Jacobe - after their flight from the Holy Land, and has been held since the mid-15th Century when bones found under the ancient church were declared those of the saints.</p>
      <p>The relics are housed in an ornate chest, or reliquary, adorned with wooden statues of the two Marys which members of the Confrerie des <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/saintes/">Saintes</a>-Maries-de-la-Mer- the lay brotherhood of the Saints Mary of the Sea - carry on their shoulders, accompanied by three horsemen dressed in the traditional attire of local cattle-herders.</p>
      <p>About 1,200 people, including hundreds of pilgrims from other parts of France and abroad, watched this year’s annual late October procession, many shouting: “Long live the Saintes Maries!”</p>

      <p>Earlier, the reliquary is lowered from the roof rafters of the 12th-Century church where it spends most of the year, only descending for its annual return to the sea and two other ceremonies. After the procession, it’s hoisted up again.</p>
