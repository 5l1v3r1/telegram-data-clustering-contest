      <p>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/algeria/">Algeria</a>’s electoral body has announced five candidates for the Dec. 12 presidential election, including two former prime ministers and all products of the system rejected by months of pro-democracy protests.</p>
      <p>The electoral authority on Saturday validated the candidacies of former prime ministers Ali Benflis and Abdelmadjid Tebboune, and two former ministers, one of them a moderate Islamist, plus the head of a small party.</p>
      <p>The elections are to replace former longtime President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, forced to resign in April after protests and a warning from army chief Ahmed Gaid Salah.</p>

        <p>The announcement came a day after tens of thousands of Algerians marched for a 37th consecutive week to demand an end to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/algeria/">Algeria</a>’s post-colonial political system. Protesters don’t trust those currently in power to ensure democratic elections.</p>
