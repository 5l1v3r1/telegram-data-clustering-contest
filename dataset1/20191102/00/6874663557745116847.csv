مستقبل داعش في ظل النفوذ التركي.. في سوريا
فكر الجهاد سيستمر وسيحصد العديد من الضحايا الأبرياء طالما هناك دول تحمي أيديولوجيته وتوفر له الغطاء السياسي فكما كتب شكري مصطفي قبل أكثر من أربع عقود: أرضي في فكري أحمله في كل مكان.

بقلم: نيرڤانا محمود
من قبل الطوفان
اسمعني يا عبد الله...
وأخرج من أرضي واتبعني... في أرض فلاة
أرضي في قلبي لم يعبد فيها الشيطان
أرضي في فكري أحمله في كل مكان
لم يكتب هذه الكلمات الرقيقة شاعر مرهف، بل إرهابي محترف يدعى شكري مصطفى، مؤسس جماعة التكفير والهجرة الإرهابية في مصر، وقاتل الشيخ الذهبي رحمه الله.
يمثل شكري مصطفى النواة الأولية لحركات الإسلام الراديكالية التي تؤمن بفكر الخلافة وتكفير المجتمع والتي تطورت وتشعبت حتى أتت بتنظيم ""داعش"" وخليفته أبو بكر البغدادي ـ الذي أعلن الرئيس الأميركي رسميا مقتله في سوريا.
يتساءل كثيرون: ماذا بعد البغدادي؟ والإجابة تكمن في تاريخ التنظيمات المتطرفة.
ظهور جماعة التكفير والهجرة أصاب معظم المصريين بالذهول، لتطرف التنظيم وإقدامه على قتل عالم أزهري جليل كالشيخ الذهبي. حكم على شكري مصطفى بالإعدام عام 1978، وظن المصريون حينئذ بأن مقتله سيكون نهاية الراديكالية الإسلاموية المتوحشة. لكنها كانت فقط البداية.
والآن، يظن البعض أن نهاية البغدادي قد تسدل الستارة على أكثر التنظيمات الإرهابية توحشا، ""تنظيم داعش""، ولكنها أيضا قد تكون البداية لمرحلة جديدة في تاريخ الجماعات الإرهابية.
قد تختلف الجماعات المتطرفة في الأسلوب والطريقة ولكنها حريصة على ثلاثة أشياء: التنوع من أجل البقاء، تغيير الأساليب لتناسب طبيعة العصر والظروف، والاتحاد في وقت الشدة لضمان الاستمرار والنجاح.
التنوع موجود الآن، حتى داخل منظومة التطرف؛ فمثلا تنظيم ""القاعدة"" يختلف تكتيكيا عن تنظيم ""داعش"". ولكن تفاصيل الأيام الأخيرة من حياة أبو بكر البغدادي تؤكد كيفية اتحاد الإرهابين وقت الشدة. فوفقا للتقارير، قتل البغدادي في بيت أبو محمد الحلبي، أحد أهم قادة جماعة ""حراس الدين"" والتي تنتمي أيديولوجيا إلى تنظيم القاعدة. مما دعا بعض المحللين، مثل د. هشام الهاشمي، لتوقع عودة ""القاعدة"" لتصدر المشهد الإرهابي، كوريث لبقايا ""داعش""، بينما يتوقع الباحث السياسي في معهد واشنطن، أرون زلين، بأن تنظيم ""داعش"" له شعبية في سوريا والعراق أكثر من ""القاعدة"" وأن له القدرة على الاستمرار وتجنيد أتباع جدد.
فمستقبل ""داعش"" في سوريا مرهون إلى حد كبير بالتطورات العسكرية في سوريا وخصوصا العملية العسكرية التركية في الشمال السوري.
استطاع اللوبي التركي في الولايات المتحدة أن يقنع صناع القرار الأميركي بأن القوات التركية ستقضي على الجماعات الإرهابية المسلحة في شمالي سوريا، سواء من الأكراد أو الدواعش (كما تدعي السردية التركية)، بينما في الحقيقة، لا تهتم تركيا بملاحقه فلول الدواعش، بل تسعى إلى خلق كيان تابع لها في شمالي سوريا يديره مجموعة من الجماعات الجهادية المتطرفة الموالية لها. يتعاطف العديد من أعضاء هذه الجماعات مع الدواعش، بالرغم من الاختلاف معهم.
أحد قادة هذه الجماعات، لواء المعتصم، كتب مقالا والعديد من التغريدات، موجها نقدا لاذعا للولايات المتحدة، واصفا البغدادي بأنه ""مات بطلا عظيما، ورجلا شجاعا ملهما للمئات أو الآلاف وربما في المستقبل سيكون ملهما للملايين"".
بالإضافة إلى ذلك، تؤكد العديد من التقارير أن القوات الأميركية، بمساعدة الوحدات الكردية، استهدفت خلايا من الدواعش موجودة حاليا في جرابلس وعفرين وكلاهما تحت السيطرة التركية.
مع الأسف، أصبح الشمال السوري مرتعا للمتطرفين من كل حدب وصوب، مما قد يساهم في تعافي تنظيم ""داعش"" بعد مقتل قائده، بالرغم من العمليات الأميركية الاستخباراتية ضد التنظيم، وخصوصا بعد تراجع الوحدات الكردية وفقدانها السيطرة على العديد من البلدان والقرى في الشمال السوري.
خيارات تنظيم ""داعش"" حاليا قليلة، ولكن حظوظه في النجاح ستعتمد على قدرة عناصره في التكيف مع الوضع الجديد في سوريا وخصوصا في المناطق الخاضعة للسيطرة التركية.
فإن استطاع الدواعش التحلي بشيء من البرغماتية، واستغلال تعاطف الجماعات الجهادية الموالية لتركيا لهم بعد مقتل البغدادي، والعودة إلى المظلة الكبرى لفكر الجهاد التي تجمع عليها التنظيمات التكفيرية، فربما يملك تنظيمهم القدرة على الاستمرار في المستقبل بشكل ما.
يركز معظم المحللين على الأسماء أكثر من الأيديولوجيات في تناولهم للجماعات الإرهابية، ولكن هذا التناول غير دقيق، فالأشخاص تموت ولكن الأفكار لا تموت.
خلقت تركيا بيئة حاضنة للإرهاب في الشمال السوري. قد يتعافى تنظيم ""داعش""، أو يتوارى، أو يعود إلى حضن تنظيم القاعدة، ولكن من المؤكد أن فكر الجهاد سيستمر، وسوف يحصد العديد من الضحايا الأبرياء طالما هناك دول تحمي أيديولوجيته وتوفر له الغطاء السياسي. فكما كتب شكري مصطفي قبل أكثر من أربع عقود: ""أرضي في فكري أحمله في كل مكان"".

The complete contents guide for purchasing a new smartphone
To what extent does the resolution affect the quality of the viewing? How many lenses does a cellphone need to produce great pictures? What's better - iPhone or Android? Just before the holiday season overseas, Calcalist presents everything you need to know to choose a great cellphone
Nov 02, 2019 by using SDN
The year 2019 is nearing an end, and every smartphone maker has already launched its best-selling devices. Around the corner awaits the American holiday season, with promotions and discounts culminating in Black Friday and Cyber Monday - a shopping spree that has also caught on in Israel.
Therefore, this is the best opportunity to buy a new smartphone. This guide will teach you how to choose the right model for you, taking into account every parameter - from screen size to the perpetual ""iPhone or Android"" question.

First of all: what is your budget? Smartphones differ in many elements - but the most significant are the durability of the device, the display size, the photo capabilities, the operating system and the interface components and the battery life. But before you start thinking about the pros and cons of any potential candidate for purchase, you must set a budget. Note that prices are valued and derived from price comparison engines, and often you can find a premium model at a surprising price.
The premium pricing devices include Samsung Galaxy Note and Galaxy S models, Samsung's P and Mate Wowi, LG's G and V, the latest (and last year's) iPhone series, Sony's Experiment 1 and more. The price ranges from NIS 2,400 to NIS 6,000 in the country.

Intermediate pricing devices are Xiaomi's Mi9 and Mi Mix, the Van Plus series (with the exception of the 7 Pro that costs a little more), some Samsung A series, Y's Wavy, LG's Q and Nokia's 9. The price ranges from NIS 1,200 to NIS 2,400 in the country. Don't let the word ""intermediate"" fool you - Van Plus and Nokia 9 include tricks that the iPhone doesn't have. The reference is only to the price level.
Reduced pricing devices are some of Samsung's A and M series, LG's and K's, and all the redmi and A series models. The price ranges from NIS 500 to NIS 1,000 in the country.

Prepare for a situation no matter how much you are looking for, you have not found the desired model at less than the price list. Therefore, you must start with the maximum amount you intend to spend.

Device durability

Who can get in the shower with you?
It used to be easier: phones just weren't durable; The front was covered with some protected glass, the back was made of plastic, and the network was full of emergency manuals for cases where the phone fell into a puddle. Today it works differently: except for the discounted series, almost every phone has some liquid and dust and dirt resistance. Hence, this is already a question of standardization. Devices with the standard IP67 and IP68 (shown in their specifications) have excellent durability and nothing to fear (I have often showered with my cellphone). MIL STD 810 devices have the best durability.

And what about the rest? They have durability, simply without a standard setting. Manufacturers do not explicitly say that phones are immune, so as not to get involved in lawsuits; My advice is to exercise caution and not just drop water, sand and more.
And what about physical resistance to blows, scratches and so on? The glass spread to the back of the device, gaining muscle; Today, most middle and premium devices are made of well-tempered glass, one that needs to be strained to shatter. On the other hand, if broken, you will feel well the cost of repair out of warranty.

How does this affect your purchase? Very simple: If you are unlucky, prefer a durable device and buy a cover. Take into account that the cover will affect the size of the device and may be less convenient to use with one hand.
Screens and displays
QHD, Super AMOLED and what's in between
I remember how we, the technology journalist, looked at the first Galaxy Note of 2013 and wondered what, what could already be done with a 5.3 inch screen phone. Times have changed to the delight of everyone, and today such a screen is considered pizzi, and consider a calculator for Cassio. The display size ranges from 5.5 inches to 6.7 inches, with the size of course determining the size of the device and, accordingly, the convenience of using it with one hand.

The issue of resolution is immaterial; All midrange and above devices have 1,080p quality screens known as Full HD (ie 1,080 pixels on the display side), with the most practical difference being how bright the screen is - meaning how easy it is to read under direct sunlight. Smartphone resolutions have code names like QHD and 2K and HD Plus, etc. But the bottom line is the insignificant difference that most mobile usage is not in apps that dedicate display quality. For example, Wetsap, Facebook, Wise, Google Maps, Twitter or basic mobile games. Even those who watch movies and series bMobile (don't you understand, don't have a TV at home?) Will still be able to enjoy FHD quality on non-high-resolution screens.
And what about the discounted phones? Some of them have a resolution of 720p, what was once called HD Ready. On days when the screen size was less than six inches, it was reasonable. But on a large screen, these are a few pixels that need to work together and therefore, you can see them. The taste buds will twist the nose, but for the average user it's really not that bad.

And technologies like Super AMOLED, or QLED and ultra-omega-LCDs? Again, it doesn't matter. These are screen lighting technologies, which determine how much electricity it will use, and the level of contrast and color. Today, all display technologies have matured so that the differences between type and type exist - but are not obvious, certainly not for the average user.
And what about other display features? Yes, there are devices like the Van Plus 7 Pro and smartphone gamers that have a faster display refresh rate (90 and even 120 Hz), which makes the interface run in a way that flows faster in the eye, but it's not such a killer feature for most users.

And folding phones? Friends, I still do not know what gives such a screen, and whether it substantially upgrades the experience or just cumbersome it in the long run. In fact, nobody knows: these products only came on the market this month. What I do know is that these are currently $ 2,000 or more phones. Not worth the money, if you ask me; What does this folding screen do to cure disease? Cameras
How many lenses do you need to take a great photo?
This is a very important feature: a lot of users love to photograph others and themselves and phones make it simply amazing nowadays. As expected, premium devices have high-end cameras, but great images can also be obtained from cheap ones, which also have sensitive sensors and algorithms that enhance frame lighting in the dark.

Except for the most basic devices, images will be good enough for their typical use: social media advertising and private groups. When should you start looking at the camera specs? When you are people who prefer photography of a certain type. For example, those who are sick of landscape images would prefer a device with a particularly wide lens; Those who shoot a lot of video will prefer a physical image stabilization device (OIS) on sensors; And those who regularly process images will prefer cameras that produce higher-resolution images (for example, in Wavy in P30 Peru, there is a 40 megapixel mode).

The number of lenses does not guarantee the quality of photography, only the number of photography modes that the hardware can support without too many software issues, and I will explain: The Nokia 9 releases great pictures with five lenses and two more sensors, while Google's Pixel 3 algorithm algorithm does it with one lens . There is no point in counting cameras when choosing a phone. However, there are cameras that stand out over others; For example - tell iPhone enthusiasts that the jump in the performance of the iPhone 11 series is very noticeable. Interfaces and operating systems
Voice activation is not what matters
There used to be very large differences in the base interfaces of the devices, but today all companies copy good ideas from one another, and the trend is minimalism. All kinds of interface add-ons - for example, LG's traffic detection, googling of Google phone pages, and so on are superficial gimmicks in my opinion. Unusual is the smart pen of Samsung's Notte devices. What a cute cracking, cute and useful. But here too it is a cute addition and not something that would be impossible without it.

An element that has gained momentum in recent years is voice acting: Apple has Siri, on Android you will find Google Assistant, and Samsung has Bixby; Three smart assistants, and all three do not support the country at full platform capabilities. Voice activation is a matter of habit, and I do not consider it a fundamental consideration in purchasing a device. By the way, Bixby speaks only English and Korean and I have yet to meet an Samsung owner who uses it.

There is one interface issue that people don't think too much about - the audio thing. Nowadays, all mid-range devices and above have a pretty loud speaker for Speaker calls, and reasonable quality in headphones. Those who are pampered may prefer the premium devices that usually get a little more successful sound amplifiers and good audio performance. LG even made it a major feature, and the sound performance on its devices is superb. Battery time
Who holds a little more?
This is the feature that most influences the phone's practicality. It doesn't matter how excellent everything is, if you have to hope once in a day that you have a socket near you or that the phone will issue a polite warning chain and then turn it off. Battery performance is affected by its power, the size of the screen - the main power saver on the device - and what it actually does with the phone.

Anyone who uses a gaming device, high quality streaming for a long time - or knows it's not disciplined enough to turn off the bluetooth when it comes out of the car, turn off the WiFi when leaving home and so on - needs a phone with a more powerful battery. Here, too, the answer is most of the premium devices. The Wavy and Sony high-end devices have excellent battery time, due to a combination of strong batteries and a successful energy management system.

What better to ignore?

Not everything that is interesting about the advertisement is also useful
There are some really cool features that sound like gimmicks or half-baked things. Just ignore them, despite what the sellers and advertisements say.
wireless charging. This is useful if you have compatible wireless headphones, but no more. First, wireless charging is much slower than usual charging with cable; And second, it's not really wireless - there's a cable, it's just plugged into the round plate on which phones are placed. And let go of the brokerage and just plug in the phone.


As long as there is a wire, it is not ""wireless""

Augmented reality. Almost every company has some Feature AR that gives a flying face, lets draw on camera video and so on. This is most often the things that try once, say ""cool"" and forget about it. Accessories. Joystick that dresses on the phone side, for gaming? Luxury car stand? Stand desk charger? Triangular toaster? All smartphone accessories are available with Express and Amazon owners, and they will always be cheaper than official accessories and will do the same. IPhone or Android?
And their ruins
About 10 years ago, a global war raged in torches between Apple and Android fans, with each side swearing in the operating system that chose and cursed and hated their opponent. This tour did not pass over Israel, and when I published a harsh criticism of the Iphone side of the story (which was the loudest of the two), I received threatening letters and often shouted at me in the street. Nowadays it doesn't really matter: the two operating systems have similar interfaces, almost identical capabilities, similar performance and compatible applications.

I guess the main consideration is why you're used to it; For example, iPhone owners will probably feel more comfortable replacing it with another iPhone, rather than losing access to paid apps purchased at Apple Store. If you ask me, Android devices are simply more lucrative, even in the premium arena; Samsung's 10th most expensive notebook surpasses the iPhone 11 Pro in several things, and costs about a thousand shekels less than its cheapest version. Additional considerations
I'm Shlomiel. Which phone do I need?
Repairs costs. Keep in mind that the more rare your phone in Israel, the more expensive and annoying it will be to repair it. Anyone who bought, for example, HTC Crypto-Von Exodus 1, will not be able to fix a broken screen in Israel without ordering the required part. If it is an exotic device such as the Galaxy Folding Fold, you may need to ship it abroad to repair it.


Broke down. What now? Photo: pixabay

Special Services Support. Take into account that not every cool mobile feature will work in Hebrew, or even be supported here. For example, Google's Pixel 4 has a lot of cool tricks related to voice activation, like setting up appointments by the assistant assistant mentioned above. What's available in Israel? Nothing; The pixel assistant has no advantage over the assistant on another cellphone. Shlomiality. Do you tend to drop the cellphone a lot? Don't choose one based on its design, you will have to buy a good cover anyway; Do you often forget the cellphone and buy new frequently? Don't pick one expensive, rope for the money. Bottom line
Try before you buy
Today it is much easier to buy a smartphone than it was five or six years ago because the industry has blurred the boundaries between model and model and between series and series. For many years I haven't seen a smartphone that is really bad - and hey, there were many of those once - so it's hard to be disappointed. However, it is important to take a look at the specification and understand what the device knows to do before choosing one, and not automatically flow with what is ""considered"".
Not every phone is suitable for everyone, and I also suggest trying it in stores before ordering. After all, you wouldn't buy a couch that you haven't sat on before and fishermen, you spend more with the cellphone than with the couch.
