Unmissable Experience
02 Nov 2019 by Cuyo Daily Writing
""A trip blindly"" is the first musical and theatrical work that focuses on a bar in Buenos Aires in the 1940s, where the characters tell the different love stories of their lives, waiting for the arrival of a important singer; and where music and stories allow the public to travel through different scenarios: Brazil and Africa, among others. But the different thing about this totally original artistic experience - which is directed by Martín Bondone - is that it is really ""blind"", since most of the actors are blind and the room is completely dark. In this way, it is the non-visual senses that become protagonists: the spectators will travel through smell, aromas and tactile stimuli. Creation of the Argentine Center of Teatro Ciego -which was already a couple of times in San Juan and with an excellent call- the proposal invites you to perceive the world from a different place, ""an original way to relax without being observed and start the adventure of feel when you don't see. ""

The appointment is today at 9 pm in Sala Z (Pedro Echagüe passing Av. Alem). Advance tickets cost $ 500 in ticket office and $ 600 before the show.
