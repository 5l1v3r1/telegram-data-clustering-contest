官逼民反的香港，讓我想起《水滸傳》裡的「豹子頭」林沖
02 Nov 2019, 00:43 by 孫婕


我們想讓你知道的是林沖是個原本想要遵守體制的受害者，最後被逼出走、落草為寇成為體制外的抗爭者，是個悲劇人物。示威者不也是這樣嗎？因為警方過度使用武力、因為「蒙面法」讓行動升級，也付出了代價。



「逃犯條例」正式被撤回了，陳同佳出獄了，可是香港已經不一樣了。
4個月下來，港鐵不定期提早停止服務、商鋪不定期提早收舖，機場偶爾關閉、民眾盡量不出門。這個以效率著稱的城市，也日益破碎。
這個城市崩壞速度和幅度之巨大，讓人不可置信。以前那個地鐵總是準時、蘭桂坊總是人擠人、銅鑼灣總是很熱鬧、晚上回家總是很安全的城市消失了，也或許再也不會回來了。
誰想得到那麼理所當然的生活環境，有朝一日會崩垮至此？
兩方暴力相對
隨著抗爭由平和變得激烈，不知不覺很多以前大家無法接受的畫面，已經變得稀鬆平常起來。以我來說：
第一次看到催淚彈煙硝瀰漫的畫面覺得擔心，現在只希望中國製的催淚彈不要對人體造成太多副作用。
第一次看到警民衝突的流血畫面覺得揪心，現在只希望不要鬧出人命。
第一次看到地鐵站被破壞的畫面覺得難過，現在只希望最重要的訊號系統不要被破壞、危及行車安全。
第一次看到商店被砸的畫面覺得不可置信，現在只希望「裝修師傅」不要順手牽羊、不要讓店鋪員工難以復工。
第一次看到水炮車出動的畫面時覺得震撼，現在只希望水炮車小心駕駛避開教堂和清真寺。
第一次看到縱火的畫面時覺得像是到了第三世界，現在看到各區同時縱火的畫面覺得稀鬆平常。
甚至，警署被投擲汽油彈的畫面，也已經讓我不以為意了。
這幾個月來警民衝突日漸嚴重，兩方暴力相對。警方當然是前科累累──721、831事件真相未明，近來又有許多浮屍與自殺案件──過度使用武力、跟黑社會勾結，都被人詬病。但示威者攻擊警察、「夜更裝修師傅」燒毀地鐵、打爛商鋪，也是暴力行為。
儘管激烈的暴力行動有效對政府和警隊帶來了壓力，這些行動同時也把這個城市打得遍體鱗傷。沒有人希望見到這個城市的崩壞，就像沒有人希望見到自己的老家被破壞一樣。
這也正是這幾個月來讓人心情低落的原因：網路直播的畫面就像是老家被拆一樣。要是官府強拆還有個正當生氣的理由，但現在打爛傢俱的是打著「官逼民反」旗號的親戚，卻陷入了左右兩難的地步。
豹子頭逼上梁山
官逼民反，讓我想起《水滸傳》裡的豹子頭林沖。
原是80萬禁軍教頭的林沖，因為貌美的妻子被太尉高俅的養子高衙內看上，而多次被陷害。起初幾次高衙內調戲他的妻子，他忍了；把他騙進高府，誣陷他持刀闖入白虎堂，將他關入牢獄。後來更將他臉上刺字、發配滄州充軍，他忍了。高衙內在滄州設計陷害他想將他致於死地，林沖發現了高衙內的詭計，這次他終於忍不住了──於是他殺了設計陷害他的人，也只好夜奔梁山逃命。而林沖的妻子因為被迫改嫁自殺明志，了卻一生⋯⋯
一個原來有家、有事業、前景光明的社會中堅，一開始選擇與政權與惡勢力妥協，可是到最後他也忍不住了。最後他選擇與體制反抗，而他曾經有過的「小確幸」生活，也永遠消失了。
林沖是個原本想要遵守體制的受害者，最後被逼出走、落草為寇成為體制外的抗爭者，是個悲劇人物。
示威者不也是這樣嗎？因為警方過度使用武力、因為「蒙面法」讓行動升級，也付出了代價：截止10月18日，超過2600人被捕。被逮捕之後若定案就得服刑，不然，就只能像林沖一樣離鄉、流亡海外。
村上春樹說：「假如這裡有堅固的高牆和撞牆破碎的雞蛋，我總是站在雞蛋一邊。是的，無論高牆多麼正確和雞蛋多麼錯誤，我也還是站在雞蛋一邊。」
在高牆與雞蛋的抗爭當中，雞蛋要付出的代價是高牆的千萬倍，必須堅持的意志力也是高牆的千萬倍。
也因此，抗爭者更需要選擇抗爭的途徑和時間。「玉石俱焚」式地讓這個城市停擺、陷入絕境，並不是最好的方式。
林沖的故事也說明了這點：被高俅父子陷害而被迫落草為寇的他，在高俅被捉上梁山之後，並沒有報這個血海深仇，而讓高俅全身而退。
也許有人會覺得林沖窩囊，我倒覺得他懂得衡量局勢——那時宋江一心想著被朝廷招安，不想讓林沖的私仇壞了大事，而林沖知道自己必須跟梁山泊共進退，也只能以大局為重，放下過去恩怨。
林沖從體制內走到了體制外，在梁山泊被招安之後，又走回了體制內。
與體制抗爭的時候他充滿悲憤，但他並沒有一路打家劫舍到底——在梁山泊當抗爭者的時候他學會了審時度勢，最後策略性地回到體制內，再度成為朝廷的武官。他的反抗行動終究還是達標了。
成功的反抗行動需要策略，而不是蠻幹到底。
祝願香港早日康復。

Hong Kong, which is against the people and the people, reminds me of the ""leopard head"" Lin Chong in The Water Margin.
02 Nov 2019, 00:43 by Sun Wei


What we want you to know is that Lin Chong is a victim who wanted to abide by the system. He was forced to leave and fall into the grass as a protester outside the system. He is a tragic figure. Isn’t the demonstrator the same? Because the police used excessive force, because the ""masked law"" allowed the action to escalate, it also paid a price.



The ""Fugitive Offenders Ordinance"" was officially withdrawn. Chen Tongjia was released from prison, but Hong Kong is different.
Four months later, the MTR will stop the service from time to time, and the shops will pick up the shops from time to time. The airport will be closed occasionally and the public will try not to go out. This city, known for its efficiency, is also increasingly fragmented.
The speed and magnitude of the collapse of the city is unbelievable. In the past, the subway was always on time, Lan Kwai Fong was always crowded, Causeway Bay was always very lively, and the city that was always safe to go home at night disappeared, and probably never came back.
Who wants to get the environment that is taken for granted, and will one day collapse?
Relative violence
As the struggle has become fierce from peace, unconsciously many pictures that were previously unacceptable to others have become commonplace. In my case:
The first time I saw the picture of tears and smoke, I felt worried. Now I only hope that the Chinese-made tear gas will not cause too many side effects on the human body.
The first time I saw the bloody picture of the police-civilian conflict, I felt worried. Now I only hope that I will not make a life.
The first time I saw the damaged picture of the subway station, I felt sad. Now I only hope that the most important signal system will not be damaged and endanger the driving safety.
The first time I saw the scene of the store being stunned, I felt unbelievable. Now I only hope that the ""renovation master"" should not be easy to take care of, so that it is difficult for shop employees to return to work.
I was shocked when I saw the picture of the water gun car for the first time. Now I only hope that the water gun car will drive carefully to avoid churches and mosques.
When I saw the arson picture for the first time, I felt like I was in the third world. Now I can see that the images of arson in the districts are commonplace.
Even the picture of the police station being thrown at the petrol bomb has made me feel uncomfortable.
The conflict between the police and the people has become increasingly serious in the past few months, and the two sides have been relatively violent. Of course, the police are ill-funded. The truth about the incidents of 721 and 831 is unclear. Recently, there have been many cases of floating bodies and suicides. The excessive use of force and collusion with the underworld have been criticized. However, it was also violent for demonstrators to attack the police and ""night decorators"" to burn down the subway and smash shops.
Although the intense violence has effectively put pressure on the government and the police, these actions have also smashed the city. No one wants to see the collapse of this city, just as no one wants to see his home destroyed.
This is also the reason why people have been depressed for the past few months: the live webcast is like a home. If the government demolitions have a reason to be just angry, but now the bad furniture is the relatives who are under the banner of ""officials and people"", but they are caught in a dilemma.
Leopard head forced to Liangshan
The official forced the people to rebel, reminding me of the leopard head Lin Chong in The Water Margin.
Lin Chong, who was originally the head of the 800,000 banned army, was framed many times because his beautiful wife was seen in the sorghum of the sorghum. At first, he sang his wife in a few sorghums. He endured it; he cheated him into Gaofu, and he fell into a white tiger hall with a knife and put him in jail. Later, he tattooed his face and sent it to Zhangzhou. He endured it. Gao Yin’s inner design in Chenzhou was framed by the fact that he wanted to kill him. Lin Chong discovered the tricks in Gaochun. This time he finally couldn’t help it—so he killed the person who designed him, and he had to run away at Liangshan at night. Lin Chong’s wife was forced to remarriage and commit suicide, but she was born for a lifetime.
A social backbone that had a home, a career, and a bright future had chosen to compromise with the regime and the evil forces, but at the end he could not help it. In the end, he chose to resist the system, and the ""small and fortunate"" life he once had, has disappeared forever.
Lin Chong is a victim who wanted to abide by the system. He was forced to leave and fall into the grass to become a protester outside the system. He is a tragic figure.
Isn’t the demonstrator the same? Because the police used excessive force, because the ""masked law"" allowed the action to escalate, it also paid a price: as of October 18, more than 2,600 people were arrested. If he is arrested, he will have to serve his sentence. Otherwise, he will be able to leave his hometown like Lin Chong and go abroad.
Haruki Murakami said: ""If there are strong high walls and broken eggs against the wall, I always stand on the side of the egg. Yes, no matter how correct the wall is and how wrong the egg is, I am still standing on the side of the egg.""
In the struggle between high walls and eggs, the price to pay for eggs is ten million times that of high walls, and the willpower that must be adhered to is ten million times that of high walls.
Therefore, the protesters need to choose the way and time to fight. It’s not the best way to stop the city from falling into a desperate situation.
Lin Chong’s story also illustrates this point: he was framed by Gao Song’s father and son and was forced to fall into the grass. After Gao Shan was caught in Liangshan, he did not report this bloody sea enmity, and let Gao Qiu retreat.
Some people may think that Lin Chong is a sac, I think he knows how to measure the situation. At that time, Song Jiang was thinking about being recruited by the court. He did not want Lin Chong’s private revenge to break the big thing, and Lin Chong knew that he had to go forward with Liang Shanbo, and he could only take the overall situation. For the sake of weight, let go of the past grievances.
Lin Chong went from outside the system to the outside of the system. After Liang Shanbo was recruited, he went back to the system.
When he was fighting against the system, he was full of sorrow and anger, but he did not fight home all the way to the end. When he was a protester in Liangshanpo, he learned to judge the situation and finally returned to the system strategically and became the military attache of the court again. His rebellious action is still up to standard.
Successful rebellion requires strategy, not ruthlessness.
I wish Hong Kong a speedy recovery.
