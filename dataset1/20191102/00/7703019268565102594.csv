Today Salvation has come to this house
Luke 19,1-10.
02 Nov 2019 by The Gospel
In the same Gospel of Luke, chapter 18, after the refusal to follow Jesus from a rich man who lives attached to his wealth, Jesus says: “How difficult it is for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God, it is easier may a camel pass through the eye of a needle that a rich man enters into the Kingdom of God. ” However, Luke himself narrates this scene located in Jericho, in which Sacking, chief of the tax collectors ”to see Jesus passing by, climbs a tree, since he was short.
Without stopping his march, seeing him above the tree, Jesus tells him: Looting, come down soon, that today I have to stay in your house. ” Looting that he had surely heard of Jesus, and why not, feeling captivated by his words and miracles, he quickly goes down and receives him at home with joy.
The people who followed Jesus begin to murmur because they consider Looting a public sinner, exploiter of the poor, who has amassed his wealth by impoverishing the simple people with his unjust and unscrupulous behavior.
In Jesus' time, the high taxes charged by the Romans to the people plunged many families into poverty and sometimes into slavery. How could Jesus, whose ministry was primarily oriented to give health, life and hope to the poor, visit a rich exploiter in his own home, and therefore a sinner?
Being in the presence of Jesus, Sacking, he decidedly says: ""Lord, I will give half of my goods to the poor and if I have harmed someone, I will give it four times more."" Upon hearing this promise of the ""sinner,"" Jesus tells the crowd: ""Today salvation has come to this house."" Jesus gives Sacking Salvation, which does not depend so much on his repentance but rather on Jesus' infinite mercy, because he has come to seek and save what was lost.


conclusion


There is no doubt that Jesus always sided with the poor, who defended his dignity in a class and exclusionary society. However, the rich, both those who have amassed their fortune with effort, and those who did it unworthily, do not have the doors of salvation closed. God will always give them the opportunity to enter the Kingdom, but yes, they will be asked in return for repentance and sharing their goods with the poorer brothers, detach themselves from the riches that enslaves them and prevents them from seeing the face of Jesus in those who suffer Wealth itself is not bad, but unfair in a society in which there are millions of brothers who live in misery. A social mortgage is levied on material assets, that is, even if they are their own, they are destined for the common good and happiness of all. Solidarity and generosity are signs that distinguish the disciple of Jesus.
