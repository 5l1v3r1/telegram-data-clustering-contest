The Senate and the Titanic Orchestra
02 Nov 2019 by Alejandro Navarro

Chile is like the Titanic, the poor dying in debt; the rich drinking whiskey and champagne, as if nothing happened; the officers, headed by the President, trying to save the privileges of the rich; and the Senate playing the violin, discussing useless projects, while the country is sinking, the poor die and the rich are saved.

When the Titanic, that ship that did not sink it or God, hit an iceberg - as James Cameron tells us - the water began to seep from the bottom up. The first class felt the shock of the impact, but continued to drink whiskey and champagne, while workers and third-class passengers began to drown.
As the water rose, more people drowned, until chaos reached the first class. The official reaction of the ship was to save the richest first, the poor always died. Poor more, poor less, it didn't matter.
Without a doubt, one of the most unforgettable scenes of the film was the reaction of the musicians. In the midst of absolute chaos, on the eve of his death, the orchestra did nothing but continue playing as if nothing happened.
Chile is like the Titanic, the poor dying in debt; the rich drinking whiskey and champagne, as if nothing happened; the officers, headed by the President, trying to save the privileges of the rich; and the Senate playing the violin, discussing useless projects, while the country is sinking, the poor die and the rich are saved.
The analogy is inevitable, because before the deep social crisis, the still President Piñera has decided to promote a social agenda - against society - that seeks to put cold cloths, so that they can continue doing business with the social rights that citizens demand . Those are the Universal Cuna Room project, which commercializes initial education; and the Minimum Salary Subsidy, which will be paid with the same workers' money, for giving only two examples.
The reaction of the Senate, when it accedes to the discussion of this ridiculous agenda, of an absolute disconnection with reality and that we all know is a hoax, is the same as that of the orchestra: keep doing what you have always done, even when It makes no sense.
That is why we do not stop screaming in the Session Room and in the halls of this Congress that is drowning. We must stop playing the violin and launch the only lifeguard that can guarantee a way out of this crisis: a Constituent Assembly.
The situation is clear, the Government is overcome, with a President whose hands are stained with the blood of bullets, torture, rapes; with a political team that is unable to process the crisis, that cannot, or does not want to, understand citizen demands and that, given the commodification of life, proposes more commodification.
Institutional policy is exceeded and entered its terminal phase. If the President does not step aside and the Senate is not played by a Constituent Assembly, only violence awaits us, which is nothing other than the anger of the poor in the face of poverty and the absence of minimum social rights.

May all of us, also the senators, give up so that the peoples of Chile decide on the Chile that must be born, after this dying Chile finishes dying.
