      <p>ESCALANTE, Utah (AP) - Authorities are seeking information on the illegal killing of a bull elk along State Route 12 west of Escalante in southern Utah in late October.</p>
      <p>The state Division of Wildlife Resources says the elk likely was shot between Oct. 19 and Oct. 22 and that officials suspect the shooter likely shot the elk from the highway and then made a U-turn to leave the area.</p>
      <p>The location where officials say the elk was “shot and left to waste” is about 9 miles (14 kilometers) west of Escalante.</p>
