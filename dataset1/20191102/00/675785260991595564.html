      <p>Like most British people, when I see photographs of tourists gurning having gunned down a defenceless and majestic wild animal, I am both repulsed and baffled. </p>
      <p>Is this really the best we can do for endangered species like lions, leopards, elephants, and rhinos – for wealthy Westerners to shoot them like fish in a bowl, and bring their dismembered parts home to hang on their walls? </p>
      <p>What we do about this matters – because it speaks volumes about how much we treasure the natural world. </p>
      <p>These iconic animals can act as champions for whole ecosystems and communities – if only we place a greater value on them alive than dead.</p>

      <p>I recognise that some people argue that trophy hunting can be a conservation tool.</p>
      <p>But at a time when the natural world is in a sorry state and species are in decline, the onus should be on the provision of conclusive proof that trophy hunting has genuine and clear conservation benefits. </p>
      <p>That’s why I am so pleased that Defra is launching a call for evidence and a consultation on the import and exports of the spoils of so-called trophy hunting – including a potential ban.</p>

        <figcaption>The Daily Mirror is calling for an end to the barbaric practice of trophy hunting in a campaign backed by politicians, celebrities and activists</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Because when it comes to animals we need to use our heads as well as our hearts. </p>
      <p>There may well be examples of best practice – but are they rare exceptions? </p>
      <p>What is the evidence to support assertions that trophy hunting creates revenues for local communities, to be ploughed back into conservation? </p>
      <p>Is trophy hunting causing unnecessary suffering to animals? </p>
      <p>What impact will action have?</p>
      <p>This is not about dictating policy to African countries – far from it. </p>
      <p>This is about focusing on our domestic responsibility – and the UK is proud to work in partnership with communities all over the continent for the protection of animals. </p>
      <p>So I hope that you – this nation of animal lovers – will make their voices heard. </p>
