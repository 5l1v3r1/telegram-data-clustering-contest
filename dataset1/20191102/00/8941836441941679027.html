      <p>CLEVELAND (AP) - Authorities say a motorist who struck and killed the girlfriend of a Cleveland Browns player will not be charged.</p>
      <p>Cleveland.com reports Cleveland police said Friday that the 47-year-old woman wasn’t impaired, speeding or driving erratically when she struck 26-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/petara-cordero/">Petara Cordero</a> in September along Interstate 90. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/petara-cordero/">Cordero</a> was the girlfriend of Browns defensive end Chris Smith.</p>
      <p>Police said Smith and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/petara-cordero/">Cordero</a> had exited Smith’s 2019 Lamborghini after it blew a tire and hit the center median wall. The woman struck <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/petara-cordero/">Cordero</a> and the Lamborghini’s front passenger door.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/petara-cordero/">Cordero</a> was pronounced dead at a hospital.</p>
      <p>The news site reports Smith paid $316 in fines and court costs Thursday for a failure to control citation connected to the initial crash.</p>
