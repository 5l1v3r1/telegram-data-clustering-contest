      <p><a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Conor-McGregor-29688">Conor McGregor</a> has been ordered to pay a fine after pleading guilty to assaulting a man in an Irish bar in April.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/27981990/conor-mcgregor-fined-avoids-jail-hitting-man-bar">ESPN</a> first reported this news on Friday that McGregor has pleaded guilty to assault, and he has been handed down a fine of 1,000 euros ($1,116.74). The Irishman has avoided any jail time, with Judge Treasa Kelly stating that it "would be inappropriate in this case." The judge also mentioned that McGregor has been convicted 18 previous times, and although many were for speeding, one was for assault in 2009.<br/><br/>In court, a member of the Irish police testified that McGregor asked the man in the bar to do a shot of his Proper 12 whiskey, and when the man refused, McGregor struck him. Since then, the <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Ultimate-Fighting-Championship-2">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a> star has apologized to the man and paid him as well, so the man did not appear in court nor did he write up a statement.<br/><br/>In August, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Video-Surfaces-of-Conor-McGregor-Allegedly-Punching-Man-in-Bar-160145">video of McGregor striking this man</a> in a Dublin bar on April 6 surfaced. The following week, McGregor <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Conor-McGregor-Takes-Responsibility-For-Pub-Altercation-Asks-For-Return-Fight-160563">appeared on ESPN</a> to take responsibility for his actions.<br/><br/>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTSgPzmehQM">his interview</a>, he admitted, "In reality, it doesn't matter what happened there. I was in the wrong. That man deserved to enjoy his time in the pub without having it to end the way it did. And although it was five months ago, I tried to make amends, and I made amends back then. But that does not even matter. I was in the wrong."<br/><br/>That incident was not the first occasion "Notorious" had been involved in legal drama, as he was <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Conor-McGregor-Arrested-in-Miami-After-Being-Accused-of-Smashing-Fans-Phone-151035">arrested in March for smashing a fan's phone in Miami</a>. He later <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Conor-McGregor-Reportedly-Reaches-Settlement-in-Lawsuit-for-Cell-Phone-Incident-152417">settled</a> with the fan. He is also <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Report-Irish-Police-Investigating-UFC-Star-Conor-McGregor-for-Alleged-Sexual-Assault-151893">reportedly under investigation for an alleged sexual assault</a> that took place in December. Additionally, he is <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Report-Conor-McGregor-Under-Investigation-for-Second-Sexual-Assault-in-Ireland-164037">currently reportedly under investigation for a second sexual assault</a> that allegedly occurred in October. McGregor has since denied this claim.<br/><br/>McGregor (21-4) last competed in the UFC at UFC 229 in November 2018, where he was forced to tap out to a fourth-round neck crank by <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Khabib-Nurmagomedov-56035">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>. The first simultaneous two-division champion, he knocked out <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jose-Aldo-11506">Jose Aldo</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Eddie-Alvarez-9265">Eddie Alvarez</a> for the featherweight and lightweight belts, respectively. McGregor has yet to win a fight since finishing Alvarez in 2016, and he is <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/UFC-Boss-Promotion-Targeting-Jan-18-in-Las-Vegas-for-Conor-McGregor-Return-164725">slated to return in January</a> against an unannounced opponent, although names rumored include <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Donald-Cerrone-15105">Donald Cerrone</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Justin-Gaethje-46648">Justin Gaethje</a>.</p>
