Respect de la constitution : De Dakar, le peuple Guinéen avertit Alpha Condé...
02 Nov 2019 by Dakaractu
""Alpha Condé n'a pas le droit de forcer un 3e mandat. Il avait posé, sur cette même constitution, sa main et y a prêté serment. Donc nous ne pouvons pas concevoir, qu'il attende ce moment, la fin de son mandat, pour venir essayer de tripatouiller les textes en sa faveur. C'est anti-démocratique"".  Ainsi, s'exprimait un des manifestants à l'occasion de leur rassemblement de cet après midi avec des mouvements de la société civile comme y'en a marre, le Frapp France dégage et tant d'autres. Pour le peuple guinéen au Sénégal, l’Afrique doit prendre exemple de ce qui se passe actuellement sur le sol guinéen pour éviter de provoquer l'attitude des peuples qui peut être regrettable. Ils ont aussi dénoncé cette violence sur les hommes, les enfants et les femmes ainsi que le mutisme des autorités guinéennes. Le message est donc lancé à partir de Dakar, pour susciter la réaction du président Alpha Condé et de lui faire savoir que ""le peuple guinéen réclame son départ et demander aussi aux peuples Africains de ne point accepter que leur constitution soit considérée comme ""un brouillon"".

The endless cycle
02 Nov 2019 by Francisco Ontiveros Gutierrez
As we have learned in the classroom, the cycle of life consists in being born, growing, reproducing and dying. They have taught us that and we repeat it by heart. This frivolous cantaleta reveals an unforgettable truth: we are all going to die! And the world will continue spinning without us, the sun rising and the moon getting dark ...
Life dresses in various forms and aromas, tones and sounds when it is embodied in each of us; in each one he appropriates a specific difference that nobody else can make. It is our task to enjoy the life entrusted to us. We are all in the world for a reason that justifies our existence.
As the poet says, ""only he who has lived has the right to die."" There is no excuse that we will all die; The endless cycle that moves us all will be fulfilled. But, the right to die is earned and, the only bad thing about dying is that it is not of love.
We have all been entrusted with a life that is called to be the greatest gift for the world, our life calls us to be a great instrument in favor of others. We are required to be bearers of the most pleasant news; our life will reach its fullness understanding that our presence must be a healing balm for so many who go around the world injured, wounded, wounded. We are called to encrypt with our lives the most beautiful song in the world!
Life consists in recognizing ourselves as true instruments of peace and justice, not bearers of wars and controversies. We are called to be the water that quenches the thirst that torments so many hearts. Only in this way will death surprise us and will find us dressed up and gracefully willing to leave the world we have come to enjoy living.
Otherwise we will simply die. It simply dies who has simply lived. That is, who has survived, who has walked slowly along the paths of life without knowing what he has come to do, without knowing the mission entrusted to him. One thing is certain, we are all going to die! And life will go on without us. What a failure that death grabs us by surprise and finds us looking for what we have not lost.
And, in fact, it can only be delivered to death with such generosity and elegance, who has known how to live. It is precisely the satisfaction of having had a life that was worth living that allows death to be embraced with the awareness of finally accessing life.
