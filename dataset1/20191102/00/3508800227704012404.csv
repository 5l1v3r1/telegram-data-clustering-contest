我們想讓你知道的是本文嘗試從《教育法》的角度，淺析教育領域「教育中立」的規範與原則，並且對應記者會上提供的彩虹愛家的活動紀錄，以及「彩虹愛家陳進隆秘書長2019.7.21在浸信會安樂聖光堂的發言」，藉以分析陳情家長對於彩虹愛家在教育現場活動的疑慮。



文：間諜媽媽
近日（2019.10.29）一群憂心的家長與各政黨民意代表召開「教室還是教會？志工入校竟傳教！」聯合記者會，質疑「彩虹媽媽」以協助國中小晨光時間的名義進入校園，但背後卻是宗教色彩濃厚的團體；彩虹愛家生命教育協會則稱入校進行的是「生命教育」，在校園的活動沒有宗教立場。
本文嘗試從《教育法》的角度，淺析教育領域「教育中立」的規範與原則，並且對應記者會上提供的彩虹愛家的活動紀錄，以及「彩虹愛家陳進隆秘書長2019.7.21在浸信會安樂聖光堂的發言」，藉以分析陳情家長對於彩虹愛家長在教育現場活動的疑慮。



教育應本中立原則
針對宗教團體或具宗教背景的團體在教育場域的活動，我國目前主要以《教育基本法》第6條的規定：
教育應本中立原則。學校不得為特定政治團體或宗教信仰從事宣傳，主管教育行政機關及學校亦不得強迫學校行政人員、教師及學生參加任何政治團體或宗教活動。
作為確立教育中立的原則。
實務上不同地區、學校的教學現場有各種各樣的狀況與需求，在這樣的背景下，相關的事務除了各自治規定以外，為促進各校理念的多樣發展，並能夠貼近學生需求的期許，公立學校的校本位課程、教師教學、或是志工入校活動，多是由各校的課發會自主規劃與檢核。教育主管機關對於與宗教中立相關的政策，目前主要以行政命令或行政指導的方式進行。
不傳教就算「教育中立」？
我國的宗教團體自解嚴以來發展蓬勃，不同宗教團體對於公共事務參與也非常積極，與公立學校的互動已相當普遍，並且也衍生若干問題和疑義。
雖然自1990年代中期（民國80年代）以來，針對宗教團體參與學校教學、教師研習，以及教科書對於宗教活動的敘寫等事項即有不少討論，並且在《教育基本法》第6條「……不得強迫學校行政人員、教師及學生參加任何政治團體或宗教活動。」的規定下，鮮少聽聞直接的強迫性宣教事件。
但因為多數宗教兼有勸人為善的教義，與世俗價值多有相似之處，因此目前宗教團體與公立學校的合作多以協助進行品格教育、道德教育、生命教育，以及性別平等教育為目的。
然而我們可以因為宗教團體協助的教學活動內容與世俗價值相似，就認定其活動符合「教育中立」嗎？
我們若是單純以「宗教勸人為善」、「提供安身立命」而認定宗教在教學現場只會發揮這些功能，不異於忽略宗教信仰本身也是意識形態、也具有排他性，並且多數信仰之間是會相互衝突的。就目前媒體上見到對於彩虹愛家生命教育協會激烈且持續的爭論，我們仍有應該要釐清與確認的事情。
彩虹愛家生命教育協會的活動有什麼疑慮？
我們首先看記者會上提供的資料，除了教學現場有歌詞具有宗教意涵的〈沒有聖誕老公公，只有愛我的主耶穌〉歌曲唱遊之外，還有彩虹愛家生命教育協會的陳進隆秘書長於2019.7.21在浸信會安樂聖光堂的發言：

3分20秒

台灣的社會如果要轉化為一個具有基督意識的國度，其實有個關鍵：現在的兒童是不是我們能把他們帶到主的面前。而我個人深深地相信有一天所有的孩子都會被接待、被耶穌所接待。彩虹愛家成立二十年，這二十年來呢，從我跟我太太，我們開始做校園的講故事、變成生命教育這樣的工作。這二十年來我們所教導過的孩子、就是有上過生命教育課的孩子，大概有2,000,000個孩子

4分30秒

彩虹媽媽彩虹爸爸加起來有6000位，這6000位的志工每一個禮拜進入學校服務，我們可以服務到150,000個孩子。

6分35秒

假設現在台灣所有的孩子都能夠上到生命教育課，都能夠有基督徒能夠陪伴他們，20年後他們大概30歲左右吧，他們所建構起來的台灣社會會不會比現在更好？

7分44秒

而這些是屬基督的價值觀所建構起來的生命教育，我想也會幫助他進入教會，也會幫助他、當他在做生命的學者的時候，他會選擇耶穌基督成為他的救主。

24分40秒

有一次我們到教會去分享，我們希望感召更多的人成為彩虹爸爸或彩虹媽媽。
回到討論彩虹愛家的校園活動，依據《教育基本法》第6條規定裡「為特定宗教信仰從事宣傳」以及「強迫參加」等文字。應該關注的是：
如果學校僅提供單一宗教背景的活動，或是單一宗教信仰的訊息，那麼得以入校的宗教團體就像是得到「特許」，比起其他無法進入該校的宗教，他們更能積極促進學生與家長對於自己宗教的認識，進而使該宗教成員人數增加、組織擴大。
在這個狀況下，不僅限縮學生認識其他宗教的機會、對有不同信仰的學生也不友善，即有違背《教育基本法》第6條所禁止「為特定宗教信仰從事宣傳」的疑慮。
衡諸我國校園氛圍與一般學生的日常生活，我們的學校相當注重出席以及團體活動的參與，各種理由的缺課皆會被校方或同學關切、詢問，在從眾壓力之下，很難有自主決定是否參加由宗教團體協力課程的自由。因此也不盡然符合《教育基本法》第6條「不得強迫參加」宗教活動的規定。
以「宗教自由」的訴求討論「教育中立」
依據彩虹愛家生命教育協會的陳進隆秘書長於2019.7.21在浸信會安樂聖光堂的發言，如果公立學校或主管機關對於這樣的主張與目的不以為意，而繼續容任彩虹愛家生命教育協會目前校園活動的內容，無異是牴觸《教育基本法》第6條的規定，也限制學生的宗教自由，更不利於培養學生對於不同宗教的寬容。
面對上述質疑，有一些聲音認為「這是針對彩虹愛家生命教育協會的攻擊，這些攻擊干預宗教自由。」但我們若以社會多元開放並且充分保障宗教自由為目的考量，「宗教自由」的概念至少應該要包括「信仰不同宗教的自由」，以及「不信仰宗教的自由」。
今日世界各地多有因為宗教信仰不同而產生的區域衝突，我們的社會也有許多不同信仰的新住民，各個宗教也持續積極發展，培養對於不同宗教的寬容與理解，實是當務之急。
這也正是為什麼在「教育中立」，學校不得為特定宗教宣傳的原則之下，課程綱要與公立學校教學仍不將宗教完全排除的原因，但認識宗教的目的不是推廣特定宗教，而是要增加我們對於不同宗教的理解，使我們的社會不歧視、不壓迫不同宗教信仰的人，以促進我們對多元文化的認同，避免不同宗教信仰間的誤解與衝突。
理想上，宗教的教育內涵應該以多元的宗教研究為基礎，包含跨信仰間的理解對話，以及人類宗教經驗多樣性的認識，也不應逕由特定宗教團體進行。

進一步確保「教育中立」，可以怎麼做？
各國的教育行政經驗上「教育中立」在宗教方面的問題都是核心重點，現今已有諸多判例與事件，著名的事件有：
德國有聯邦憲法法院「教師戴頭巾」與「教室的十字架」等判決、日本有神道教與天皇敬拜儀式的問題、澳洲則針對因為宗教信仰上的理由而不能遵守學校規定的狀況訂有Conscience Clauses（良心條款），可以免受處罰、美國則有「學校公禱」與「成立宗教社團」等案件，並且最高法院在1971年Lemon v. Kurtzmen案中，建立了用以檢視政策或法律是否對於宗教事務採取中立原則的判斷準則。
縱使各國的法律制度、教育制度與國情大不相同，但我國自1990年代中期（民國80年代）以來，針對宗教團體參與學校教學、教師研習，以及教科書對於宗教活動的敘寫偏頗等事項已有諸多爭論。
這些質疑並不全是針對彩虹媽媽，靜思語、法輪功、大愛媽媽均有發生過爭議，至今次的彩虹愛家生命教育協會事件，再再證明了我們社會應該更謹慎地看待「教育中立」，並且採取更積極的行動。
雖然本文認為學校自主發展校本課程，與各校自主規劃教學活動，更能積極回應教學現場學生的學習需求，但在邀請宗教團體入校時，不論是基於上述何種教育目的，對於教學活動內容的適切性、教學的頻率的合理性等事務上都應該更加謹慎。教育主管機關應該更積極地促進或協助各地方教育局、以及各學校對於「教育中立」原則的認知與實踐。

No problem without teaching? The doubts behind Rainbow Mother's ""religious propaganda"" on campus
02 Nov 2019, 00:44 by Featured Reprint


What we want you to know is that this article attempts to analyze the norms and principles of ""educational neutrality"" in the field of education from the perspective of the ""Education Law"", and corresponds to the record of the activities of Rainbow Love House provided at the press conference, and ""Rainbow Love House Chen Jinlong"" The Secretary-General's 2011.7.11 speech at the Baptist Church Anle Shengguang Hall was used to analyze the doubts of the parents of the love of the Rainbow Family at the educational scene.



Text: Spy Mom
Recently (2019.10.29) a group of worried parents and representatives of various political parties held a ""classroom or church? volunteers entered the school and actually preached!"" joint press conference, questioning ""Rainbow Mom"" to help the country in the name of the morning light time to enter the campus, but behind It is a group with a strong religious color; the Rainbow Ai Family Life Education Association says that the school is carrying out ""life education"" and there is no religious stand on campus activities.
This paper attempts to analyze the norms and principles of ""educational neutrality"" in the field of education from the perspective of the ""Education Law"", and corresponds to the record of the activity of Rainbow Love House provided by the press conference, and ""Rainbow Aijia Chen Jinlong Secretary General 2010.7.11 in the dip The letter from the letter will be held by the Friends of the Church, to analyze the concerns of the parents of the love of the rainbow in the education scene.



Education should be based on the principle of neutrality
In view of the activities of religious groups or groups with religious backgrounds in the field of education, China currently mainly adopts the provisions of Article 6 of the Basic Law on Education:
Education should be based on the principle of neutrality. Schools may not engage in propaganda for specific political groups or religious beliefs, and educational executives and schools may not force school administrators, teachers, and students to participate in any political group or religious activity.
As a principle of establishing education neutrality.
In practice, there are various situations and needs in the teaching sites of different regions and schools. In this context, in addition to the various autonomy regulations, the related affairs are to promote the diverse development of the concepts of the schools and to meet the expectations of students. The school-based curriculum, teacher teaching, or volunteering school activities of public schools are mostly planned and checked by the school's class conferences. The policy of the education authority regarding the neutrality of religion is currently carried out mainly by administrative order or administrative guidance.
Is it ""educational neutrality"" without teaching?
Religious groups in our country have developed vigorously since the release of the straits. Different religious groups have also been very active in public affairs. The interaction with public schools has become quite common, and it has also generated a number of questions and doubts.
Although since the mid-1990s (the 1980s), there have been many discussions on the participation of religious groups in school teaching, teacher learning, and textbooks on the description of religious activities, and in Article 6 of the Basic Law of Education. School administrators, teachers, and students must not be forced to participate in any political group or religious activity. Under the stipulations, direct obsessive missions are rarely heard.
However, because most religions have the doctrine of persuading people to be good, and there are many similarities with secular values, the current cooperation between religious groups and public schools is mostly aimed at assisting character education, moral education, life education, and gender equality education.
However, can we recognize that the activities of the religious activities are similar to the secular values, and that the activities are consistent with ""educational neutrality""?
If we simply use ""religion to persuade people to be good"" and ""provide peace of mind"" and recognize that religion can only perform these functions at the teaching site, it is tantamount to ignoring that religious belief itself is also ideology and exclusive, and most beliefs will interact with each other. conflicting. As far as the media is concerned about the intense and ongoing debate over the Rainbow Ai Life Education Association, we still have something to clarify and confirm.
Do you have any doubts about the activities of the Rainbow Family Life Education Association?
We first read the information provided at the press conference, in addition to the songs on the teaching site that have the religious meaning of ""there is no Santa Claus, only the Lord Jesus who loves me"", and the Secretary-General of the Rainbow Love Home Life Education Association, Chen Jinlong, at 2019.7 .21 at the Baptist Church Anle Shengguang Hall:

3 minutes and 20 seconds

If Taiwan's society is to be transformed into a country with a Christian consciousness, there is actually a key: whether the children of today can bring them to the Lord. And I personally deeply believe that one day all children will be received and received by Jesus. Rainbow Love has been established for 20 years. In the past 20 years, from my wife and I, we have started to do storytelling on campus and become a life education. The children we have taught in these 20 years, that is, children who have attended life education classes, have about 2,000,000 children.

4 minutes and 30 seconds

Rainbow Mom and Dad add up to 6,000. The 6,000 volunteers enter the school every week and we can serve 150,000 children.

6 minutes and 35 seconds

Suppose now that all children in Taiwan are able to attend life education classes, and all Christians can accompany them. After 20 years, they are about 30 years old. Will the Taiwan society they construct be better than now?

7 minutes and 44 seconds

These are life educations constructed by the values of Christ. I think he will help him into the church and help him. When he is a scholar of life, he will choose Jesus Christ as his Savior.

24 minutes and 40 seconds

Once we went to the church to share, we hope to call more people to become Rainbow Dad or Rainbow Mom.
Going back to the discussion of the campus activities of Rainbow Family, in accordance with Article 6 of the Basic Law on Education, ""Promotion for specific religious beliefs"" and ""Forced participation"" are included. What should be concerned is:
If the school only provides activities with a single religious background or a single religious belief, then the religious groups that are allowed to enter the school are like “privileges”. They are more active in promoting students and parents than other religions that cannot enter the school. The understanding of one's own religion has led to an increase in the number of members of the religion and an increase in organization.
Under this circumstance, it is not only limited to students' chances of knowing other religions, but also to students with different beliefs. It is contrary to the suspicion of ""promoting for specific religious beliefs"" prohibited by Article 6 of the Basic Law of Education.
Weighing the campus atmosphere of our country and the daily life of ordinary students, our school pays great attention to the participation and participation of group activities. The absence of classes for various reasons will be concerned and questioned by the school or students. Under the pressure of the audience, it is difficult to decide independently. Whether to participate in the freedom of the concerted by religious groups. Therefore, it does not comply with the provisions of Article 6 of the Basic Law on Education, ""No forced participation in religious activities.""
Discussing ""educational neutrality"" with the appeal of ""religious freedom""
According to the speech of Secretary-General Chen Jinlong of the Rainbow Ai Family Life Education Association at the Baptist Church Anle Shengguang Hall at 2019.7.21, if the public school or the competent authority does not care about such claims and purposes, it will continue to serve as the Rainbow Ai Family Life Education Association. The current content of campus activities is no different from the provisions of Article 6 of the Basic Law on Education. It also limits the religious freedom of students and is not conducive to cultivating students' tolerance for different religions.
In the face of the above-mentioned doubts, some voices said that ""this is an attack against the Rainbow Ai Family Life Education Association. These attacks interfere with religious freedom."" But if we consider social diversity and full protection of religious freedom, ""religious freedom"" At least the concept should include ""freedom to believe in different religions"" and ""freedom to believe in religion.""
Today, there are many regional conflicts in different parts of the world because of different religious beliefs. Our society also has many new residents of different faiths. All religions continue to develop actively and cultivate tolerance and understanding of different religions. This is a matter of urgency.
This is precisely why, under the principle of ""educational neutrality"", schools cannot promote propaganda for specific religions, the syllabus and public school teaching still do not completely exclude religion, but the purpose of recognizing religion is not to promote specific religions, but to Increase our understanding of different religions so that our society does not discriminate or oppress people of different religious beliefs in order to promote our recognition of multiculturalism and avoid misunderstandings and conflicts between different religious beliefs.
Ideally, the educational connotation of religion should be based on pluralistic religious research, including inter-religious understanding dialogues, and the understanding of the diversity of human religious experience, and should not be carried out by specific religious groups.

What can be done to ensure ""educational neutrality""?
The issue of ""educational neutrality"" in religious education in all countries is a core issue. There are many jurisprudence and events. The famous events are:
Germany has the judgments of the Federal Constitutional Court ""teacher wearing a headscarf"" and ""the cross of the classroom"", Japan has a Shinto and emperor worship service, and Australia has a Conscience for failing to comply with school regulations for religious reasons. Clauses (conscience clauses) can be exempted from punishment, and in the United States there are cases such as ""school prayers"" and ""establishment of religious associations"", and the Supreme Court established the 1971 Lemon v. Kurtzmen case to examine whether the policy or the law is The principle of judging the principle of neutrality for religious affairs.
Even though the legal system and education system of different countries are very different from those of the national conditions, since the mid-1990s (the 1980s), China’s participation in school teaching, teacher study, and the textbook’s bias in the discussion of religious activities has been A lot of controversy.
These questions are not all aimed at the Rainbow Mother. The Jingsi language, Falun Gong and the big love mothers have all been controversial. The Rainbow Love Life Education Association incident has proved that our society should be more cautious about ""educational neutrality"". And take more active action.
Although this paper believes that the school's self-developed school-based curriculum and the independent planning of teaching activities of each school can more actively respond to the learning needs of the students on the teaching site, when inviting religious groups to enter the school, whether based on the above-mentioned educational purposes, the content of the teaching activities Appropriateness, the rationality of the frequency of teaching, etc. should be more cautious. The education authorities should be more active in promoting or assisting local education bureaus and schools in their understanding and practice of the principle of ""educational neutrality"".
