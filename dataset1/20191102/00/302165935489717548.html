      <p>PETALING JAYA, NOV 2 — It's an eight-part anthology featuring different Asian film-makers telling stories that explore the human condition with narratives inspired by food... Asian food.</p>
      <p>HBO's <i>Food Lore</i>, which debuts this Sunday, November 3, covers stories from India, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore and of course, Malaysia.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the Vietnam and Philippines episodes made their world debut at the Tokyo International Film Festival. And the India episode will debut at the Singapore International Film Festival later this month.</p>
      <p>Malaysian film-maker Ho Yuhang not only directed the Malaysian episode but wrote it as well.</p>
      <p>In fact, fans of Ho's work which he often describes as "bleak" will be in for a surprise. While his usual genre involves a tragedy or a major conflict, that's not how he plays it for <i>Stray Dogs</i>.</p>
      <p>"I just wanted to write a simple story about two people, their relationship and how they slowly affect one another."</p>
      <p>It's a theme he believes will resonate with many, since it's a common situation. In writing this story, Ho admits he enjoyed working out how to write such an understated and subtle story with food.</p>
      <p>Ho explained that the anthology is "not a food show as there are so many of that out there. It's most importantly stories with a food element."</p>
      <p><i>Food Lore</i> is a project by Singaporean film-maker Eric Khoo with whom Ho worked previously in another HBO anthology — the horror themed <i>Folklore</i>.</p>
      <p>Ho's Stray Dogs centres around two characters who enter into an unlikely friendship; one is a young, ambitious multi-level marketer called Tim, played by Fabian Loo while the other is a gangster turned chef called Maki, played by Wilson Tin.</p>
      <p>For a broader point of view, Ho decided to feature an array of dishes cooked in a <i>dai chow</i> rather than a single dish. Central to the story, however, is <i>sambal</i> which Maki uses to cook up various dishes like <i>sambal petai</i>.</p>

      <p>Ho explained, "<i>Sambal</i> is always a great supporting actor as it makes your food taste so good. I like the fact that <i>sambal</i> is behind the scenes, just like this is a story about supporting actors. They're not heroes but just day-to-day people."</p>
      <p>For Tim's character, Ho had written it with Loo in mind, as a young man with a positive attitude. Previously Ho had cast him for a film but they didn't end up working together.</p>
      <p>After Ho cast Tin as Maki, he discovered that he actually owns his own restaurant where <i>sambal petai</i> is a popular dish!</p>
      <p>In Stray Dogs, one of the dishes at Maki's <i>dai chow</i> is chicken cooked with beer which Tin recreated at his restaurant. It has now become a permanent dish after his customers sampled it. </p>
      <p>As for the title of the episode, many may wonder what it has to do with food. Ho chuckled, "At first we thought what a strange title but we felt it had oomph."</p>
      <p>While there is an actual scene where Maki feeds some stray dogs, Ho's title has a deeper meaning.</p>
      <p>"I feel that these two people are like strays. They have a past, live alone and there is a feeling that people don't understand them."</p>
      <p>Malaysia-born Taiwanese film-maker Tsai Ming-Liang also has a movie titled <i>Stray Dogs</i> which depicts people on the fringes of society, a metaphor which Ho uses here as well.</p>
      <p>The award-winning film-maker actually became interested in movies because he enjoyed reading film books borrowed from a Buddhist temple library in Petaling Jaya!</p>
      <p>Later, when the PJ boy went to Iowa State University to study electrical engineering, he gained a broader access to all kinds of movies. Bored with electronic circuits, he decided to pursue his love for movies.</p>

      <p>Ho learned the ropes in TV production by starting at the bottom and working with directors like Dain Said and the late Yasmin Ahmad.</p>
      <p>In 2003, his debut feature Min picked up the Special Jury Prize at the Festival des 3 Continents in Nantes, France.</p>
      <p>His film <i>At The End Of Daybreak</i> not only received the NETPAC award at the Locarno Film Festival but also garnered seven Best Actress Awards for lead actress, Kara Hui.</p>
      <p>His short film <i>Trespassed</i> won the Financial Times Emerging Voices film award in 2015 while his latest film was a Malaysia-Hong Kong production titled <i>Mrs K</i> which not also starred Kara Hui but Simon Yam as well.</p>
      <p>Ho shot <i>Stray Dogs</i> in 10 days at locations around PJ's Section 17 and Seapark area.</p>
      <p>He often features the Section 17 neighbourhood in his works since it's where his home and office are based.</p>
      <p>Since food is an integral element in <i>Stray Dogs</i>, Ho shares with us his favourite eats around the area.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wantan mee</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's not popular but Ho likes the texture of the noodles at this stall.</p>
      <p>Location: Goodview Kopitiam, 1091, Jalan 17/27, Section 17, Petaling Jaya</p>
      <p>
        <b>Chee cheong fun</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ho likes this old woman's chee cheong fun and yong tau foo at the morning market. Previously, she would ride a bicycle around the neighbourhood. Later she upgraded to a motorcycle which she now parks at the market.</p>
      <p>Location: Section 17 morning market, 1042, Jalan 17/27, Section 17, Petaling Jaya</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fried carrot cake</b>
      </p>
      <p>This particular stall owner also sets up stall at the pasar malam in SS2 which is where Ho originally ate his fried carrot cake about 40 years ago!</p>
      <p>Location: Section 17 morning market, 1042, Jalan 17/27, Section 17, Petaling Jaya</p>
      <p>
        <b><i>Food Lore</i> premieres on November 3, 10pm on HBO (Astro channel 411 and 431HD). Ho Yuhang's Stray Dogs will air on December 22, 10pm.
