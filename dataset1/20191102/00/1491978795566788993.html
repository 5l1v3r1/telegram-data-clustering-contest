        <i>The Nigel Twiston-Davies runner, who carried top weight to a nine-length win at Chepstow last time, can foil the market leaders at Wetherby</i>
      </p>
      <p>La Bague Au Roi is the obvious market leader for the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby as she steps out of novice company having failed only narrowly to complete a perfect debut season over fences when second in a Grade One at Aintree in April.</p>
      <p>Her race-fitness is the doubt, though, after nearly seven months off and last year’s winner, Definitly Red, has had a similar break. That could leave an opening for race-fit <b>Ballyoptic (3.40)</b>, who carried top weight to a nine-length win at Chepstow last time.</p>
      <p><b>Wetherby 1.20 </b>On the face of it <b>Cougar’s Gold</b> was a little fortunate to finish second at Exeter last time as three of his opponents went at the second-last. He had been stopped in his tracks a couple of fences earlier, however, and still crossed the line in a decent time.</p>
      <p><b>Ascot 1.35</b> There was plenty of support for <b>Earlofthecotswolds</b> on his chasing debut at Market Rasen last month and he was trading at 1-5 in running when he fell at the second-last. A bit more polish to his jumping should give him the beating of this field.</p>
      <p><b>Wetherby 1.55</b> There was just a neck between Lady Buttons and Indefatigable on identical terms at Doncaster in January and, though the winner had a little in hand, <b>Indefatigable</b> was making only her fourth start over hurdles. She should certainly not be nearly twice the price of the favourite.</p>
      <p><b>Ascot 2.10</b> Only a couple can be ruled out with confidence but <b>The Last Day</b> is on a handy mark on the balance of his form last season.</p>
      <p><b>Wetherby 2.30</b> Thebannerkingrebel has made a decent start to his hurdling career but must give 10lb to a different class of opponent on Saturday. <b>Proschema</b> was useful on the Flat – he raced off 104 at Goodwood in the summer – and made a very promising debut over timber at Chepstow last month.</p>
      <p><b>Ascot 2.45</b> <b>Adjali</b> was campaigned in Grade One events as a juvenile and could have more to offer this season than some of his rivals here, though it is clearly a competitive heat for a seasonal debut.</p>
      <p><b>Wetherby 3.05</b> The veteran Unowhatimeanharry would be a hugely popular winner but his best days are now more intermittent than they were in his pomp. <b>Ballyandy</b> is three years younger and has the added benefit of a run this season.</p>
      <p><b>Ascot 3.20</b> Black Corton and Bryony Frost will attract support after a decent return last time while Vinndication is a hot prospect and has had a wind op since last year. At the prices, though, a small interest in Black Corton’s stable companion <b>Adrien Du Pont</b> could be rewarded at around 16-1. He has also had a wind operation, ran well on his handicap debut in this race last year and has gone well fresh in the past.</p>
