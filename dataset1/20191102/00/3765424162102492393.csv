Notes from the 560: Wells of Death
02 Nov 2019, 00:30 by Bangalore Mirror Bureau
What would you do if you found a 65 foot hole sinking into the ground for no apparent reason? I’ll tell you what some of Karn­ataka’s politicians would do. A hole that deep is a great place to hide rebel MLAs and horses that want to jump ship. It works both ways - for those who have split a party, lured legislators to abandon their party and vice versa for the party that is desperately trying to keep its members from leaving. Resort politics is established in the state but it’s still pretty easy to locate legislators in a guarded resort. It’s much more difficult when you stash all your incumbents, political turncoats, independents and rebels into a hole dug in some corner of the state. Even satellite imagery is unlikely to find things hidden in a hole because it’s in and under the earth’s surface. What else can one hide in a deep hole? There’s always black money that can be stashed in it. Off shore accounts right from Switzerland to Antigua to some unheard of coastal island somewhere in the pacific contain much of India’s wealth. Black money hoarders don’t need to dump their cash in such obscure foreign accounts when a hole deep in the ground can do the job much better and for free. These holes are so deep into the earth’s surface that any agency trying to unearth this would need to spend an insane number of manhours just to skim through the top soil. While the entire country has been celebrating Deepavali this past week, one family in neighbouring Tamil Nadu has been in mourning. The family of 2 year old have had to say goodbye to their son Sujith while the rest of us were eating sweets and bursting fire crackers. The child unfortunately wandered into an uncovered, dry and abandoned borewell. India prayed for Sujith but that had little effect as the child’s life was not salvaged. The depth of the borewell was 65 feet. How many more children have to die before authorities realize that the least they can do is cover up open borewell shafts? These holes are drilled, often illegally in areas where drilling should not be allowed. Permissions are given at the cost of a bribe to residences and commercial institutions which then try to tap the ground water table in an effort to find water. The fact that even 65 feet into the earth’s surface doesn’t yield water is a separate story in itself but once found to be dry; such holes are just abandoned and forgotten. It’s only when a child unable to discern the hole falls in and battles for his or her life that this becomes a priority. In most cases children who fall into abandoned borewell shafts do not survive. This isn’t just a problem that is restricted to Chennai, it’s a national epidemic and Bengaluru is home to way too many abandoned borewell shafts. There are literally hundreds of such shafts in city areas as well as the outskirts. Villages that are being replaced with townships have very little protocol regarding the digging of borewells. The authorities can much rather use these holes to do something useless instead of covering them up and saving lives. This week it was announced that Tipu Sultan’s story will not be taught in text books anymore. We can now discard all the old textbooks into abandoned borewells. Why not? At least that way we can gain some use out of them instead of just fishing out more and more bodies. Follow Aditya Magal on twitter @jhunjhunwala

Chiefs send 10-man Pirates packing on penalties
02 Nov 2019 by Staff Reporter
Cape Town – Goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi was the hero as Kaizer Chiefs booked their place in the Telkom Knockout semi-finals with a 4-2 victory on penalties against 10-man Orlando Pirates after a pulsating Soweto derby ended 2-2 after extra-time.
Fortune Makaringe had given Pirates the lead in the first half, but Chiefs hit back with Leonard Castro equalising after the half-time interval as the game finished 1-1 after the regulation 90 minutes at a packed Moses Mabhida Stadium.
Daniel Cardoso converted a penalty early in extra-time, but Gabadinho Mhango made sure the match went into the lottery of a penalty shootout.
The match started at a good pace with Chiefs testing Pirates ‘keeper Wayne Sandilands as early as the first minute as George Maluleka had an effort on goal.
Amakhosi started the game stronger and were denied the chance to take the lead in the 22nd minute when Samir Nurkovic headed into the back of the net but was controversially ruled offside when replays suggested otherwise.
The Buccaneers started to get more into the contest and Vincent Pule hit the post after a brilliant one-two on the edge of the box with Kabelo Dlamini.
Another referee controversy ensued just after the half-hour mark when Thembinkosi Lorch appeared to stamp on Billiat as the Zimbabwe international was on the ground.
The match official decided to only show a yellow card to the Bafana forward when a red was more appropriate.
Chiefs’ frustration would have been exacerbated when Lorch was involved in the opening goal just two minutes after he should have been sent off.
Kabelo Dlamini was picked out after he made a good run down the left flank and fired in a cross to Lorch in the box, who did well to tee up Makaringe to score past Akpeyi.
As the game was heading for the halftime interval, it was Chiefs that got away with a refereeing decision as Akpeyi was lucky to stay on the pitch after appearing to foul Makaringe when he was through on goal.
No foul was given and the teams went into the break with Pirates holding the slightest of advantages.
Pirates’ task to stay in the lead was made even more difficult just five minutes after the break when Mthokozisi Dube was shown his marching orders after receiving his second yellow card after a foul on Billiat.
It was long after when Chiefs found the equaliser as Castro hit the back of the net from a rebound after Billiat had hit the post after good work initially by Lebogang Manyama.
The game certainly ebbed and flowed throughout with Pirates certainly showing good character and fighting spirit as they gave as good as they got with a man less.
The team in white could have even snatched the game before the 90 minutes was up as they created chances on the counter-attack.
Chiefs went 2-1 ahead when Cardoso converted a spot-kick early in the extra-time period after Abel Mabaso was adjudged to have handled the ball in the penalty area.
Pirates though were not phased and kept coming, even being a man and a goal down, Mhango levelled the once again as more good work by Lorch set it up the strike.
The game went into the dreaded spot-kicks and Akpeyi saved from Ben Motshwari and Mabaso while Chiefs converted all four penalties to advance to the last four of the Telkom Knockout.
