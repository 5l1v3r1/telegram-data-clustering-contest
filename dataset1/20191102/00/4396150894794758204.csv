Israel attacks Gaza after rockets launched towards Israel
Hamas began last year with the weekly demonstrations against a blockade of Israel and Egypt that takes 12 years

CITY OF GAZA, Gaza Strip (AP) - Israeli planes began attacking militant sites in the Gaza Strip on Saturday morning, hours after Palestinian militiamen launched 10 rockets into southern Israel, ending a month of tranquility on the volatile border.
In an initial statement, the Israeli army said its warplanes ""began attacking terrorist targets in Gaza"" while shelling was heard on the other side of the coastal enclave.




The Palestinian press reported that several air strikes were against training sites and outposts affiliated with Hamas, the Islamic militia group that controls Gaza, and other groups.
Three Palestinians had moderate to severe injuries caused by splinters from one of the attacks, according to Gaza health officials. Witnesses at Nasser Hospital, in the southern city of Khan Younis, said the three were sitting in an orchard adjacent to one of the posts that was attacked.
On Friday afternoon, 10 rockets were launched south of Israel in two rounds with minutes apart, causing damage to a house.
There were no reports of deaths. Israeli police said shrapnel damaged a house in the southern town of Sderot and videos show a car near the structure with broken windows.
The Israeli army said seven rockets were launched in the first incident and that the Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted them. Minutes later, three rockets were launched and only one was intercepted.
No Palestinian group claimed responsibility for the attack.
Israel blames Hamas leaders in Gaza for any attack from the enclave. The militia group says it remains committed to maintaining an unofficial truce, but other groups that include Iran-backed Islamic Jihad and smaller Salafist factions sometimes act independently of Hamas.
Hours earlier that same Friday, Gaza health officials reported that several Palestinians were shot dead during protests along the border fence between Gaza and Israel.
Hamas began last year with the weekly demonstrations against a blockade of Israel and Egypt that takes 12 years.
International mediators, including Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations, oversee the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel to decrease the intensity of the protests and pacify the border area in exchange for humanitarian projects in the coastal enclave. Hamas blames Israel for not complying with the agreement by delaying the implementation of the pact.
