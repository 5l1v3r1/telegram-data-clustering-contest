      <p>BOSTON (AP) - Ottawa forward <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-sabourin/">Scott Sabourin</a> has been taken from the ice on a stretcher with his head immobilized after a collision with Boston forward <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-backes/">David Backes</a> early in the first period of Saturday night’s game between the Senators and Bruins.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-sabourin/">Sabourin</a> skated up to make a hit on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-backes/">Backes</a> when the players’ helmets collided. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-sabourin/">Sabourin</a> immediately feel to the ice, appearing to be unconscious, and he lay motionless for a brief period.</p>
      <p>Medical staff from both teams rushed to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-sabourin/">Sabourin</a>, and a Bruins’ trainer quickly signaled for a stretcher. There was a large blood spot on the ice under <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-sabourin/">Sabourin</a>’s face.</p>
      <p>TV cameras showed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-backes/">Backes</a> visibly upset, looking as if he was fighting back tears, as he watched medical personnel attend to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-sabourin/">Sabourin</a>. An Ottawa player could be seen consoling <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-backes/">Backes</a>, putting his glove on his shoulder.</p>
      <p>Fans gave <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-sabourin/">Sabourin</a> a loud ovation when he was taken from the ice. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-backes/">Backes</a> went to the dressing room after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-sabourin/">Sabourin</a> was wheeled off.</p>
