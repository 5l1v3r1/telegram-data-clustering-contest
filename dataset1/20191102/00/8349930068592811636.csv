العلماء يكتشفون فئة جديدة كليا من الثقوب السوداء في مجرتنا

02 Nov 2019

اكتشف العلماء فئة جديدة من الثقوب السوداء أصغر من أي فئة معروفة حتى الآن لهذا التجمع الكوني في الزمكان.
واعتقد العلماء لسنوات عديدة أن الثقوب السوداء يجب أن تكون على الأقل بنحو 5 أضعاف كتلتها، إلا أنهم اكتشفوا حديثا ثقبا أسود يبلغ حجمه 3.3 أضعاف كتلة الشمس فقط، ما يجعله أصغر ثقب معروف في مجرة درب التبانة.
وغالبا ما توجد الثقوب السوداء فيما يعرف بـ”النظام الثنائي”، وهو نظام يتكون من جرمين فلكيين، حيث يدور نجمان حول بعضهما حتى ينفد وقودهما وينفجران.
وتترك انفجارات “المستعرات العظمى” هذه، وراءها نواة كثيفة تسمى النجم النيوتروني، أو إذا كانت هناك كتلة كافية، فيمكن أن تترك ثقبا أسود كثيفا لا يمكن حتى للضوء أن يفلت منه.
ودرس العلماء بيانات 100 ألف نظام نجوم ثنائية حتى عثروا على ثقب أسود صغير بشكل غير عادي، يبلغ حجمه 3.3 أضعاف كتلة الشمس فقط، مقارنة بما يتراوح بين 5 أضعاف إلى 15 ضعفا لكتلة الشمس، في الثقوب السوداء المعروفة.
وقد يساعد هذا الاكتشاف علماء الفيزياء على فهم عملية المستعرات العظيمة المكونة للثقب الأسود، والتي هي مفتاح تكوين عناصر معينة وتطور الكون.
وقام عالم الفيزياء الفلكية تود تومبسون، من جامعة ولاية أوهايو، وزملاؤه بتحليل البيانات التي تم جمعها من خلال المرصد المسمى Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment، والتي تتضمن الأضواء القادمة من نحو 100 ألف نجم في درب التبانة.
ويمكن أن تشير التغييرات في أطياف الضوء من النجوم إلى أن نجما يدور حول كائن آخر، ربما غير مرئي، مثل ثقب أسود.
وبحث العلماء عن النجوم التي يحتمل أن تكون قريبة من ثقب أسود، ومن هذا المنطلق تمكنوا من تجميع آلاف الصور لكل نظام من هذه النجوم، ورصدوا من خلالها نظام نجم واحد أطلق عليه اسم J05215658 يدور حول جسم ضخم مخفي يبلغ نحو 3.3 أضعاف كتلة الشمس، وهو أصغر بكثير من أي ثقب أسود معروف سابقا.

Focus: So the Post is reborn from the ashes!
02 Nov 2019 by bamada.net
Paying particular attention to the rebirth of La Poste, the public authorities of Mali are only doing justice to one of the oldest institutions in the world, attacked for decades by the commercial all, at the turn of which, as the Union advised Universal Postal Code (Upu) since 1985, the user had to disappear to be replaced by the customer. The shade is worth its weight of gold!



Thus, without being prepared, postal workers in a number of African countries had to adapt very quickly to a new environment in which business logic was imposed on the traditional public service.
The postal administrations that were quickly projected in the air of time, are those who understood that it was then necessary to reconsider quickly, redefining more exactly the job, the foundation on which any viable development strategy must be built. More prosaically, It was therefore necessary to understand quickly that with the development of Information and Communication Technologies, the transfer of funds would go from the physical circuit to the virtual one. This is to adopt these technologies, which have ended up upsetting lifestyle habits around the world. It was therefore necessary to make a break in which the marketing approach should be used to anticipate the demand for services, by studying the evolving needs of the population.
But the postal administrations that had this chance to resist this upheaval of the environment and then to upgrade a little bit, are not part of those almost forgotten by their public authorities, more concerned with managing reforms on a daily basis. the Bretton Woods institutions in unpopular austerity policies, leading to the collapse of many African regimes in the 1980s and 1990s.
This was more serious for La Poste in Mali, a veritable laboratory for drastic reforms of the postal sector, in the name of the alleged conditionality of budget support that underpinned the reforms. This has led to the departure between purely postal services and postal financial services, which are today, however, the axis of development of the largest postal administrations in the world. And some of these postal administrations even allow themselves to create postal financial institutions, real popular banks of modern style that play a decisive role in banking inclusion.
However, it was after the split of the post office in Mali that lost important and futuristic services such as postal checks and savings bank, that postal workers from neighboring countries, having understood the harmful nature of said reforms imposed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, have mobilized to avoid the same fate at home. The example of Mali was very often cited by West African postal union leaders who were fighting against what they called ""the balkanization of the post office in Mali"".
Malian Post, having served as guinea pig, was reduced, after the separation of postal services and telecommunications, to divest itself of its branch of financial services, to keep only the services relating to the processing of physical mail, postal orders , parcels and postal packages. The following is known: the physical mail is cannibalized by the electronic one, the service of the orders killed by the electronic transfers of money and the service of parcels and postal parcels harvested through authorizations delivered to private companies of courier. It was the first-class burial of the postal monopoly, shot down by the passage of time.
It is therefore happy to see that despite a long journey through the desert, women and menes of Mali's big postal family have never given up. They showed patience and self-sacrifice in getting the post out of the premeditated agony, in which she was plunged. Finally the end of the tunnel to permanently exit the Malian Post from the shadows and make it shine in the sun of hope and the full moon of the performance.
But this is only the beginning of the rebirth of the Post. The Malian state must therefore accompany the Post Office, which is recovering, by operating its two essential levers: on the one hand, its proximity to the population built on solid expertise in the provision of public services, and on the other hand its network built over the years.
This network, which is part of the planning and development of the territory, must be strengthened. This is where the public authorities must invest a great deal in planning, in the name of spatial planning, the presence and the place of the Post Office in all the localities of the country, and especially in the new neighborhoods that are pushing back every day. the limits of the capital, Bamako. This is the best way to support the efforts of the current management team of the Malian Post Office whose strategic approach aims to rehabilitate the heritage, make the post more visible and attractive, not only by its physical presence, but also and above all through its innovative service offerings.
The combination of the efforts of the postal family, the public authorities and the people, will enable the Post of Mali on the path of prosperity and efficiency, so that it can very quickly find a real national and to play its role of high strategic importance in the work of national construction, just like the railways that are unfortunately waiting to be rehabilitated.
