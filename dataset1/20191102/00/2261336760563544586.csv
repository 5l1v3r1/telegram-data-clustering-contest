02 Nov 2019, 00:03 by Mookie Alexander



The Canelo Alvarez vs. Sergey Kovalev weigh-ins took a stupidly long time to get done, but they’re done and we have a title fight for Saturday. Canelo (52-1-2, 35 KOs) weighed 174.5 lbs for his light heavyweight debut, but Kovalev (34-3-1, 29 KOs) needed multiple cracks to make weight.

Kovalev initially weighed 176 lbs, then down to 175.5 lbs, then 175.25 lbs, and the crowd wasn’t happy with this. Fourth time was the charm, and he made it down to 175 lbs. The WBO light heavyweight title is now officially on the line on Saturday night in Las Vegas.
What happened, you ask? Well for Kovalev, who just fought in late August, this was the reason.
