      <h1>Report: Trump to Ban All Vape Flavors Except Tobacco, Menthol</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T00:00:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Victor Tangermann</a></address>
      <p>It’s a terrifying epidemic: a <a href="https://futurism.com/vape-nicotine-mice-lung-cancer">mysterious vaping illness</a> has gripped the nation and lawmakers are desperate to get ahead of it.</p>
      <p>According <a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-ban-flavored-vaping-products-4830652d-af8d-4c84-81b0-2174e9ad3344.html">to <i>Axios</i></a>, the Trump administration is set to announce a plan for a complete ban on all flavored vaping products next week — except for two noteworthy exceptions: tobacco and menthol flavors.</p>
      <p>The <i>Washington Post </i>had <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/trump-considers-retreat-from-ban-of-mint-menthol-vaping-flavors/2019/10/25/f75a1592-f705-11e9-b2d2-1f37c9d82dbb_story.html">previously reported</a> that senior health officials wanted to make exceptions for tobacco, mint, and menthol flavors, since they are far more popular with adults than with children.</p>
      <p>It’s an interesting development, considering Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/trump-considers-retreat-from-ban-of-mint-menthol-vaping-flavors-1.1337380">has been quoted</a> in the past saying that mint and menthol should also be included in the ban.</p>
      <p>“These products are still getting to kids and we cannot let a whole generation get addicted to them through mint and menthol and other flavors,” Azar <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/trump-considers-retreat-from-ban-of-mint-menthol-vaping-flavors-1.1337380">told reporters</a> on September 11, the day the White House <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/doctors-link-vape-lung-sufferers">initially called</a> for a vaping product ban.</p>
      <p>On Monday, <i>WaPo</i> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/trump-considers-retreat-from-ban-of-mint-menthol-vaping-flavors/2019/10/25/f75a1592-f705-11e9-b2d2-1f37c9d82dbb_story.html">reported</a> that mint and menthol were being reconsidered by the White House as exceptions to the ban, while tobacco flavor was set to get an exception regardless.</p>
      <p>It’s a controversial move that’s bound to receive backlash. Some have called it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/trump-considers-retreat-from-ban-of-mint-menthol-vaping-flavors/2019/10/25/f75a1592-f705-11e9-b2d2-1f37c9d82dbb_story.html">bad policymaking</a> and government overreach.</p>
      <p>And others just say it will be ineffective.</p>
      <p>“Excluding menthol would be huge — it means that kids will buy menthol,” public health attorney Desmond Jenson <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-campaign-urges-white-house-to-soften-proposed-flavored-vape-ban/2019/10/25/5d39dbae-f733-11e9-a285-882a8e386a96_story.html">told the <i>WaPo</i></a>. “If you give them one flavor, that’s what they will buy. It doesn’t solve the problem.”</p>
