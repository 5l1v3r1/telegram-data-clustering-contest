The UFC is at Madison Square Garden in New York City for Saturday’s UFC 244 fight card. The pay-per-view event, which streams on ESPN+, is headlined by a welterweight contest between Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz. The BMF title, which was created in the mind of Diaz and spoken into existence, is on the line in that matchup. In the co-main event, Kelvin Gastelum welcomes Darren Till to the middleweight division.Every fight on the pay-per-view portion of the card has high stakes, but that doesn’t mean you should skip the prelims and wait to watch the pay-per-view portion of the card. No, the prelims have some intriguing matchups as well. 
At the top of the prelims, Corey Anderson, who has quietly put together a three-fight winning streak, faces Johnny Walker who has loudly and memorably won his first three UFC fights with “Performance of the Night” bonus-winning knockouts. This bout represents a big test for Walker, who a showy and charismatic competitor who looks and acts the part of a fun title contender. However, Walker has never faced a takedown attempt in the UFC. If there’s anything Anderson does, it’s takedowns.
Before that, two of the more exciting featherweights in the UFC face off when Shane Burgos faces Makwan Amirkhani. Burgos is 12-1 in his career, while Amirkhani is 15-3. Both fighters are on two-fight winning streaks. 
Also on the prelims is the unbeaten Edmen Shahbazyan, who is managed by Ronda Rousey. The 21-year-old has set a goal of becoming the youngest champion in UFC history. The middleweight competitor is 10-0 in his career. Shahbazyan faces UFC veteran Brad Tavares, whose past two losses have come to current UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesanya and former UFC titleholder Robert Whittaker. Tavares had a four-fight winning streak between those two setbacks.
