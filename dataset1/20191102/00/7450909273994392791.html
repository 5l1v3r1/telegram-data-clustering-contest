      <p><i>The ordering process for Ultimate Fighting Championship pay-per-views has changed: UFC 244 is only available on <a href="https://bit.ly/31MSVH1">ESPN+ in the U.S.</a></i><br/><br/>Heavyweight boxing star Tyson Fury made waves in the world of mixed martial arts recently, stating that he would be making his debut in the sport by the end of the year. He could potentially be trained by none other than <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Conor-McGregor-29688">Conor McGregor</a>, who invited the boxer to come to Ireland and train with him.<br/><br/>Fury has been testing out the waters in other sports and on Thursday made his pro wrestling debut in the WWE, beating Braun Strowman at WWE “Crown Jewel” via count-out.<br/><br/>Now, Fury has declared that he’s now prepared to step inside the Octagon to fight anyone in the UFC, mentioning champion <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Stipe-Miocic-39537">Stipe Miocic</a> as someone he’d “fight in a heartbeat,” as well targeting arguably the most powerful heavyweight on the roster in <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Francis-Ngannou-152341">Francis Ngannou</a>.<br/><br/>Fury spoke to IFL TV to reiterate that he has his sights set on the best MMA fighters on the planet and named the champion Miocic and Ngannou as two names he’s open to fighting (via <a href="https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/ufc/tyson-fury-says-hed-fight-stipe-miocic-and-francis-ngannou-in-a-heartbeat/">BJPenn.com</a>).<br/><br/>“Who’s the heavyweight champion of the world in the UFC? The American-Croatian, Stipe Miocic. I’ll fight him in a heartbeat, no problem, or Francis Ngannou. Any of the heavyweights they’ve got, I’m not afraid of any of them. I’m the ‘Gypsy King.’ I’m a boxer, but I’m one badass motherfuc*er.”</p>
