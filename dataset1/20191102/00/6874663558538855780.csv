The magnificent summer home in Tel Aviv that has become a junkie's lair
In the lowest place in Tel Aviv once stood a vacation home of a Japanese noble family, around which orchards and orchards were planted. Today you can find injection drug users and victims in the feed circle. How has the status symbol of the wealthy become the refuge of Israel's social margins, and what will happen to them?

On Samaria Street adjacent to the old Central Station in Tel Aviv, perhaps the pumping stone of Israel's social fringes, is a prestigious summer house of the nobility family. This may sound puzzling, but in the area where today's harsh mirrors of used syringes and human beings are dormant, there were orchards Green people, horse stables and one well house - this is the Rock family's well home - the highest in the entire area that currently lies between the old Central Station and Jaffa. Who was the Rock family? How did its orchards become a rural farmers neighborhood? How did the rural neighborhood become? An immigrant neighborhood with two major stations, and how these have become a haven for junkies, And daughters, no status and the most difficult social periphery of Israel?

Alfred nee Rock, born in the mid-19th century. A Christian gentleman from Jaffa, he owned a vast orchard and is particularly fertile on the historic Jaffa-Nablus Road, the one we know today as ""Jaffa Road"". On the outskirts of the thriving orchard, Rock built the well home that was used to irrigate the orchard during the dark months of May and November. The well was, of course, excavated on the ground floor, which was mainly used for pumping. Above it, as a later addition, was built a luxurious living room with marble floors, high ceilings, wall decorations and tiled roofs. Alfred built this house at the end of the century and he used his wealthy family as a vacation home in the heart of the orchards they own.

The Rock Family Beer House is part of a unique phenomenon of unparalleled well homes elsewhere in the country and not in neighboring countries. The wells were two-story or three-story buildings adjacent to a pool for absorbing the pumped water from which branches of the orchard irrigation were used by the well. Their main purpose was, as mentioned, watering the orchards in the darkest months of the year. But over time, the complexes included warehouses, stables, a living room and an orchard. Most of the wells and orchards belonged to the wealthy Jaffa residents. As far as is known, this phenomenon began as late as the 18th century, when a number of factors joined together to make Jaffa a citrus and fruit empire: starting with the sense of security that made it possible to exit the city walls, the coastal aquifer that allowed digging of wells and available water, land suitable for growing citrus fruits, and Jaffa Port. Which allowed easy and convenient export to Europe where the citrus fruits became a desirable and desirable commodity. Geographically, Jaffa orchards reached from Bat Yam today to the area of Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv to the north, Old Jaffa to the west and the village of Salma - a complete village of today - to the east. These well houses can still be seen as Russian buildings scattered mainly in southern Tel Aviv and in the streets of Jaffa outside the Old City walls, and are characterized by unique architectural features.
In 1902, the Rock family's story took a dramatic turn. One of the summer days of that year, Alfred Rock went for a walk with his friends in the young colony of Rishon Lezion. As described in the ""View"" newspaper from Elul that year, Alfred and his friends were involved in a brawl that flared up with the residents of the colony, during which Alfred Rock, Jacob Rambov's son-in-law, was shot and killed by Alfred Rock. The murder sparked a great deal of anger and heavy grief in the young community, and its leaders were determined to do justice. Alfred Rock, despite his excellent relations with the Ottoman authorities, fled the country for fear of being executed. It was at this point that the Rock family began to sink.

From the time Alfred was absent from his orchard, his family was in debt until she was forced to sell the orchards and the luxurious well home in the 1920s. The rest of the Rock family's assets, his father's and brother's assets, remain. But during these years, in the exchange of mandates, the balance of power in the country began to change for the benefit of the Jewish immigrants who came in droves. The Rock family orchards were purchased by nearby Neve Shanan families. And as early as 1927, after the trees were uprooted, East Pavilion pavilions were built on the grounds, as well as the building that would initially serve as a library and later as a ""central"" cinema.

We know Neve Shaanan today as the deep south of Tel Aviv, a neglected neighborhood saturated with harsh mirrors that is on the public agenda mainly around questions of refugees and migrants. But this neighborhood started out a whole different way. Neve Sha'anan Association was established in 1921 after the events of 1948 that claimed many victims. 400 Jews who died in Jaffa and did not want to live in young Tel Aviv because of the lack of clothFires and the difficult economic situation, they decided to establish an independent rural neighborhood that could provide agricultural produce to Tel Aviv and Jaffa and compete with the monopoly of Arab produce from Jaffa and German from Sharona. Joseph Tischler designed the neighborhood in the shape of a cane lamp when Levinsky Street will be the sun from which the other streets of the neighborhood branch. The idea was to mix uses - agricultural areas alongside industrial and craft.

The lamp's integrity interrupted two missing areas that their owners refused to sell: the orchard and Alfred Rock's well home to the northwest, and another orchard to the southeast. Rock returned to the country only as part of a settlement agreement in which he had to pay 10,000 francs. Upon his return, Rock continued his activities as a political activist as the only Christian member of the Supreme Arab Committee, and as Vice President of the Palestinian Arab Party. These two parts, which were sold to Neve Shanan Jews by the enthusiastic Palestinian activist, have over the years become two bulky, busy and noisy central stations in the heart of the neighborhood. The Revenge of the Rock family was served cold. Their orchards became the black holes of Tel Aviv.

The old central bus station, right next to the well house, was built in 1940, as a main bus stop to replace bus terminals throughout the city. The station was designed by architects Nahum Zalkind and Yosef Wittkovar as a modern and innovative terminal, along with a continuous system. But the station, which in the 1940s was capable of the small Jewish settlement, failed to meet the burden of the Great Immigration after the founding of the state. The bus stops slowly trickled down the streets of Neve Sha'anan. Shopping centers and recreation have sprung up alongside the station and the entire area has become crowded and crowded with noisy traffic, and thousands of people from all over the country. Neve Sha'anan no longer fulfills the vision of its founders, its rural character has no trace. On the contrary, the area has become sober, neglected, and noisy.

The second area left empty in the heart of the neighborhood is the one to build a new central station, the one that was supposed to save the neighborhood from the congestion of the old station's surroundings and concentrate all the hustle and bustle under one roof and over six floors of transport, trade and recreation - the ""new central station"" in Ram's design Carmi. Once it was built, the old station became an abandoned area and many businesses began to close one after the other. The new station, which, according to Carmi himself, was supposed to be a direct continuation of the streets leading to it, became a brutal concrete monster in its history as well as its effects on the Neve Shanan neighborhood, a special column. The important thing to remember is that Neve Shaanan has not become a supreme power, quite the opposite - it is a history of planning and neglect that reflects the complex relations of north and south, center and periphery within the city of Tel Aviv and, as a case, represents the entire State of Israel.

Even after the territories were sold and after the station was built, the Rock family's well house remained in place. It was purchased at a key fee by Isaiah Chanukhov, and it sealed the well shaft on the ground floor and used it to operate a mosaic workshop. After moving with his family to northern Tel Aviv in the late 1950s, he retained ownership of the property and established a nursery there. As we recall in those years, the place became particularly bustling, so the place was more suited to the business than raising a family. The exact same nursery operates today and is operated by Bella Krebs. Bella inherited the place with her two sisters, and after a dispute between them the partnership in the family business was dissolved.

Around a rock house is a tin fence that surrounds the nursery area operating there. The building itself suffers from dampness and its dismal condition. His front as stated on Samaria Street and from where the entrance to the nursery is, but the back of his head is facing the Acre Trail - in the current incarnation of southern Tel Aviv it is entirely the lowest and darkest place. The surroundings of the Rock family's luxurious summer home are mostly used by various injection drugs, street vendors and prostitutes. When the old station was closed, the people's movement was replaced by cruising cars awaiting sexual services from those drug users, alongside families of asylum seekers with their small children who in many cases grow up to the most difficult sights Israeli society can offer. Bad margins for glory.

And how does Tel Aviv deal with its margins? Builds on them towers in the hope that they will disappear or at least get some more sleep. A new tower complex will be built on the old central station complex. The complex will include more than 1,300 apartments, shopping centers, businesses and culture. Among other places is the seat of the seven-year-old dance troupe. The complex will extend from Heng StreetIn the north to the Hebrew Battalion Street to the south, Har Zion Boulevard to the east and Begin Road to the west. The days of the no-man's land of the Acre Trail are numbered. Alfred Rock's well is designed for preservation according to the plan's instructions as discussed in the Tel Aviv District Committee, as well as after discussion of objections to the plan. The Rock House and its surroundings will be part of the futuristic complex, but will retain the many architectural values of the building on a host of unique features, including the high ceilings. In addition, the historical values of the place as a well house will be preserved - the landscape of the orchards and the irrigation canals should be integrated into the surrounding area of the building when restored, giving evidence of the magnificent ""Jaffa Gardens"" phenomenon. , As the orchards were called in Hebrew literature Of the period.

As expected, the program has many opponents, especially the date of the residents of southern Tel Aviv as well as professionals and social activists. The expectation of historical justice with the area for them has been let down. The tower overload, which is described in the letter of resistance signed by social activist Shula Keshet - who is already a councilor in the Tel Aviv municipality - will serve the corporate office towers and turn the area into a ghost complex at night and on weekends. It was also claimed that the towers will again displace the population in the neighborhood and this time because of the price of apartments in the towers. The demand for a socioeconomic balance of the Tel Aviv municipality itself did not come to fruition, according to the opponents. Dr. Talia Margalit of Tel Aviv University, who gave her opinion as part of the residents' opposition, wrote: ""The proposed construction is moving away from the neighborhood and relates mainly to what and to those outside it - to the north.""

Why does the Neve Shaanan neighborhood not receive the same treatment from Neve Tzedek or the Yemenite Vineyard? Or, God forbid, of the Tel Aviv neighborhood? The answer is clear, and it indicates the future of the entire area between Elon and the sea. A saturated future, towers, business complexes and poor public spaces. The natural exchange process, gentrification, tends to be much criticized, but this process is inevitable as long as there is no extraordinary economic crisis and as long as the natural growth of the population continues to spell. In this case, there is an aggressive, somewhat cynical foothold of the capital's owners on a neighborhood that has already seen and heard everything. The Rock family's well was a marker of agricultural innovation that enabled Jaffa's orchard industry. Many layers have these red tiled roofs and each carries the human story of this fascinating space. The orchard landscape replaced by farmers' homes will now move from a deserted and daunting space to a polished and innovative breeding complex. But Alfred Rock's glorious summer home is still in place and doesn't seem to be going away.
