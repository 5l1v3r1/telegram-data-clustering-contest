They invite to participate in the special celebrations by the faithful departed in the cemeteries of the Capital city
02 Nov 2019 by Santiago
Today, the bishop of the diocese of Santiago del Estero, Monsignor Vicente Bokalic, will officiate a mass at the La Piedad cemetery to commemorate the Day of the Dead Faithful, from 10 in the morning.
The celebration of the Mass will be in the renewed chapel of the necropolis, which is part of the works that the municipality executed to value the historic central building, the entrance hall, the facade, the access of vehicles and the large quilts, which were recently enabled.
To allow family visits, the necropolis will be open from 7 in the morning until 19.30.


Control


For this opportunity and due to the great attendance that is expected for this date, the Municipality of the Capital diagrammed a special operation that covers the ordering of traffic in the surroundings and in the entrance and exit, in addition to the reinforcement of security with the presence of greater police personnel.
Similarly, there will be controls at flower stands and will prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages in the vicinity of the necropolis. Meanwhile, a routine pressure control stand will also be installed for people who require it.


Peace park


In the private cemetery Parque de la Paz, the doors will remain open from 8 to 20, and by 9 the celebration of the Holy Mass is planned by the presbyter Julián Cueva.
Those who wish to include their deceased beings in the mass requests may register them until just before the beginning of the celebration.
