Bolsonaro comemora aniversário de criança que recebeu coração transportado pela FAB
Alicia conheceu o presidente em cerimônia do Dia do Aviador, no dia 18 de outubro, e o convidou para seu aniversário
02 Nov 2019 by O Povo
O presidente da República, Jair Bolsonaro, foi até a cidade de Ceilândia, no Distrito Federal, para comemorar o aniversário de 10 anos de Alicia Alves Silva, na manhã dessa sexta-feira, 1º.
Aos dois anos de idade, a menina recebeu um coração transplantado de um morador de São Paulo (SP). O transporte do órgão entre as duas cidades foi feito pela Força Aérea Brasileira (FAB).
Alicia conheceu o presidente em cerimônia do Dia do Aviador no dia 18 de outubro, que ocorreu na Base Aérea de Brasília, em setembro. Na ocasião, a menina convidou Bolsonaro para seu aniversário, que aceitou imediatamente. A primeira-dama Michelle Bolsonaro é natural de Ceilândia.
No encontro, Bolsonaro expressou sua alegria em participar da celebração com Alicia, apontando similaridades entre a menina e sua filha, Laura.

Transporte de órgãos

A FAB atua em parceria com a Central Nacional de Transplantes (CNT), levando os órgãos ao local onde está o receptor. Em 2019, foram feitos 121 voos para transporte de órgãos. O fígado foi o mais transportado, seguido pelo coração e pelos rins.
Em média, um voo de transporte de órgão dura pouco mais de cinco horas e possui uma tripulação composta por três integrantes da FAB, além da equipe médica responsável pelo transplante. A escolha da aeronave depende de fatores como distância a ser percorrida. As mais usadas são o Embraer 110 Bandeirantes (C95), o Embraer 120 Brasília (C97) e o Laerjet 35 (U35).
Desde 2017, a FAB disponibiliza 24 horas uma aeronave e dez tripulantes, exclusivamente, para o transporte de órgãos.

The transition to digital, a cultural challenge

02 Nov 2019

This text is part of a special notebook.
Supported by researchers and professors at the National School of Public Administration (ENAP), the public service is setting in motion a vast modernization program to make the digital shift. what could be done, admits Éric Caire, Minister Delegate for Government Digital Transformation. That said, since we have been in government, we have taken the measure of the situation and we are working hard to transform all of our departments and agencies. ""
In fact, the government tabled its digital transformation strategy last June. The project to consolidate the computer processing centers of public organizations, which provides for a physical centralization of the storage of all data in Quebec and Montreal, was launched in February. And the government is currently working on the first cybersecurity policy and the establishment of a government cyber defense center. As for the new Québec center of digital excellence, its objective is to offer support to public organizations in the implementation of their digital transformation plan.
""For the moment, we are developing what is less tangible for the citizen,"" concedes the minister, ""but we have laid the foundations that will allow us to move quickly now, to adequately meet the needs of the citizens of Canada. twenty-first century. ""

Past reality

In the short term, the government wants all services to be accessible through the websites of ministries and public bodies. That you no longer have to travel to redo your driver's license or apply for a lease renewal for a bistro owner. That all this can be done digitally, with a smart phone. Better still, the government wants to eliminate as much as possible all the cards - driver's license, RAMQ, hospital cards, etc. - which clutter our portfolios. ""The cards are really a past reality,"" says Cairo.
If the government seems to have set the pace, all the experts do not believe that the train is going fast enough, and especially that it is going in the right direction.
""We can not really talk about public service reform today,"" says Guillaume Lavoie, lecturer at the National School of Public Administration (ENAP), specializing in collaborative economics and public policy. As long as we believe that the digital switchover is a technological issue, we will miss the modernization of the state. In reality, it is a cultural issue. Because it is mainly about accepting, on the one hand, that information is more democratically distributed and shared, and on the other hand, that citizens are more active in decision-making processes.
""Traditionally, the one with the information is the one with the power,"" continues Mr. Lavoie. Sharing it is perceived as a loss of power. There is some form of resistance. ""

Create new soil

Same analysis by Daniel J. Caron, professor at ENAP and holder of the Research Chair in Exploitation of Information Resources. According to him, digital is a relationship between technology and the human. ""Making a digital shift is not just about adding technology, he believes, it's about creating a whole new world, working differently, thinking, reacting differently. ""
He takes the example of the websites of the administration and government agencies. The citizen expects something more alive, he says. He would like to be able to chat in real time with a chatbox program to get an immediate answerment.
""The world of possibilities is much broader, ergonomic and user-friendly,"" insists Mr. Caron. It's difficult to implement because we're not starting from scratch. It is necessary to reinvent a whole machine conceived in the years 60-70, as much to say in the Middle Ages. But if the public administration does not go faster, it will quickly lose credibility. Citizens will find alternative solutions, including turning to the private sector. ""

Citizen collaboration

When everyone agrees to step outside their zone of trust and embrace the possibilities offered by digital technology, the results are often very rewarding. An example is the chronoscope, a research-action project that aims to design, develop and experiment a platform for citizen collaboration in the development of documentary heritage.
""We are appealing to citizens interested in history and heritage to provide us with all the information they have on archival images,"" explains Christian Boudreau, ENAP researcher and head of the chronoscope. . Digital is making more and more archives photos available online. But for many, we do not have information. However, there are people who have first-hand knowledge or who are so passionate that they have expertise sometimes equal to certain professionals. ""
Today, digital technology makes it possible to join these communities of passionate people. Thus, through the Facebook page of the chronoscope, a citizen allowed last week for example to put a name on a church whose archives had lost track. Not only did the lady recognize the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce church in Hull, but she even pinned an article about her destruction by fire in 1971.
""Thanks to the community, we are safeguarding the memory of Quebec,"" says Boudreau. And these are tasks that archivists do not have time to do. ""
Last month, the state launched the first consultation platform of the Quebec government. Over time, it can be used by all the government authorities who wish to consult the entire population or a specific public in order to develop, for example, a strategy, an action plan or of a policy.
""The world is moving very fast now, Guillaume Lavoie concludes. We must agree to test things, to set up pilot projects, various initiatives, even to be wrong and to go back. ""
