Newcastle pummel charitable West Ham 3-2 in EPL

02 Nov 2019

LONDON (AP) - Newcastle roared into a three-goal lead and held off a late comeback to beat West Ham 3-2 in the English Premier League on Saturday.
Goals from Ciaran Clark, Federico Fernandez in the first 22 minutes, and Jonjo Shelvey in the second half fired the Magpies to their second away victory of the season and hauled them away from the drop zone.
They were assisted by a comically inept display from Manuel Pellegrini’s expensively assembled West Ham, who were booed off at halftime and by those fans who bothered to stay until the end at London Stadium.
Late goals from Fabian Balbuena and Robert Snodgrass gave the scoreline a flattering look that West Ham did not deserve. They have gone six games without a win.
Before this, Newcastle had not scored more than one goal in a match this season. Fernandez had never scored a goal for the Magpies. Yet, West Ham simply laid out the welcome mat, and could have been down by five at halftime.


Newcastle was always going to sit deep and hit the hosts on the break, but it seems nobody told West Ham.

Terminator. Dark Fate (Terminator VF: Dark Fate)
02 Nov 2019 by Manon Dumais



According to James Cameron, producer of the lucrative franchise, this sixth installment of Terminator would be the direct result of Terminator 2. The final judgment, the best of the series. Now, in places, one would think a remake feminist flavor of T2 as its story is apparent. In fact, we find a woman without history (Nathalie Reyes) who receives two visitors of the future: a Terminator (Gabriel Luna) who wants to eliminate him and a super-soldier (Mackenzie Davis) who wants to protect her. To the delight of the fans, Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger take on the roles of Sarah Connor and T-800 respectively. Twenty-eight years later, both are more than ideal. He who had dazzled the gallery with the spectacular Deadpool, Tim Miller seems wise here. With no dead time, benefiting from convincing special effects, his performance skilfully follows scenes of pursuit, shootings and muscular fighting, without exceeding Cameron's T2. Our full review
Terminator - Dark Fate (V.F. Terminator - Dark Fate) ★★★ Science Fiction by Tim Miller. With Mackenzie Davis, Nathalie Reyes, Linda Hamilton, Gabriel Luna and Arnold Schwarzenegger. United States, 2019, 128 minutes.
