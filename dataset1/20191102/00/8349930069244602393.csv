Judge blocks Trump’s attempt to make immigrants prove they have
02 Nov 2019 by Stephen Dinan
A federal judge issued an order Saturday blocking President Trump’s proclamation that would have ordered government screeners to refuse entry to would-be immigrants who can’t prove they have their own health insurance.
Judge Michael Simon, an Obama appointee to the federal bench, said Mr. Trump’s Oct. 4 directive likely exceeds the boundaries of immigration law.
He put a four-week hold on the policy to give himself more space to hear full legal arguments, but he made clear he thinks Mr. Trump went too far in his steps to try to prevent immigrants from becoming a public burden.
“Congress has spoken directly to the circumstances in which an individual may be deemed to become a “financial burden” to the United States and has rejected the proclamation’s core premise,” the judge wrote.

In addition to finding the thrust of the proclamation against the law, he also said the insurance standards the president set out are probably unworkable.

Sacha, a slammer engaged
02 Nov 2019 by bamada.net


Sacha the slameuse, whose real name is Aicha Diarra, is one of the first girls to have marked the path of Malian slam. After impressing on national and international scenes, Sacha la slameuse is now dedicated to the training of young slamers within the group Agoratoire. In addition to slam, Sacha also wears the cap of playwright and actress.





A student in letters at the Faculty of Arts and Language Sciences (Flsl), the young lady, Aicha Diarra nicknamed Sasha la Slameuse, is one of the pioneers of women's slam in Mali. In 2014, she discovered slam during an inter-school competition organized by Agoratoire. ""Everything started from a competition organized by Agoratoirre in 2014 when I was in high school. I finished third in this competition. Since that day, I had the taste of slam and that's how I decided to join the group Agoratoire in 2015, after my baccalaureate, ""she tells us.
Sascha the slameuse is known for her talent and the relevance of the themes she addresses in her texts. Very talented, she had to impress the Malian public through its services during many cultural events. Her talent also earned her an international presence, particularly in Niger and Ivory Coast where she appeared on the slam scenes of the Babi Slam festival. After having subjugated by her talent of slameuse, Sasha was chosen as in charge of the workshops of slam thus trainer within the group Agoratoire. A status she is proud of because she is happy to be able to pass on her know-how to her cadets.



In the vision of Sacha the Slameuse, slam is not limited to a simple declamation of rhythmic texts. Slam is something else, more precious. Indeed, she says: ""Slam is giving what you can not say like any normal person. As a slam artist, I have the freedom to say my thoughts that can be heard to the highest level. "" According to Sacha, slam reflects a thought that a simple ordinary citizen can not express. In a word, slam is freedom of expression. ""A slammer is a messenger. He is the voice of society. He is the one who can find the evils of society in order to express them before whom by right. Slam can be a driver of change for a country, ""she says.
As a trainer in slam, Sacha believes that Malian slam is very promising because young people are increasingly interested in the field, unlike a certain time when the Malian did not pay enough attention to slam. One of the main objectives of Sacha the slameuse is to popularize the art of slam throughout Mali.
Speaking of her projects, Sacha is currently on a slam book that she hopes to publish very soon. ""I think it's good to make an album, but it's even better to write a slam book. Unlike songs that can fall into oblivion, a book if the writing remains forever, ""says Aïcha Diarra who aims to write his name in the annals of slam Malian, African or global.




Playwright and actress

Literary in training, Sacha is not that slameuse. She is a writer-playwright. Author of many theater texts, Sacha is a writer committed to the cause of girls, women and children. She has written on family planning for the social program of an international organization. A play that features two families, one ""modern"" approves the practice and the other (traditional) opposes. After long negotiations, the two families agree on the adoption of family planning. ""Certainly we must not forget the traditions, but we must change with the traditions,"" she launches. The schooling of girls is also a frequent theme in drAïcha Diarra.
The themes in her writings push viewers to give her the status of a ""feminist"". Which she does not dispute.
