The “Chango” Córdoba, from world champion to dad of the heart
Today his life passes between the love and affection he offers to his nieces Milagros and Celena Banegas, who lost their father in a dramatic and painful time for the family. “I enjoy them every day and they make me happy,” said the former WBO world champion.

He was always a champion. He sucked boxing from the cradle and comes from a family that supported him at all times. He touched the sky with his hands and today he feels that he is very happy. “I live with my mother to whom I give my love and take care of her. It was the one that gave me everything in this life and I will never stop thanking him for what he did and continues to do for me. ”
That very special feeling is from Juan Domingo Córdoba. That huge warrior who on January 17, 1998 became the world champion of the WBO minimoscas and made history for the entire sport of Santiago del Estero. It was in the stadium of the Olympic Cycling Club of the city of La Banda and before the fierce Mexican fighter, Melchor Cob Castro.
But that is another story. The next one is different and familiar. He has a sadness because he is a person who made a drastic decision and left everyone with a difficult pain to erase. And for the ""Chango"" Córdoba his life changed.
“It was very hard that moment. The father of my two nieces, who at that time were 7 years and two months, respectively, made the decision to take their own lives and left the whole family in great pain. He was a person who looked after his wife and daughters. There was nothing missing from them. He will know why he did what he did, ”said Juan Domingo when he remembered the terrible family situation and that he left Milagros and Celena Jazmín Banegas without his father's love.
Then he added: “From that moment I changed my life. I told myself that I would be next to my nieces and that I would take care of giving love and contention. Today they both say daddy to me. The oldest has a physical problem and the youngest is also a love. They make me happy and I enjoy sharing many moments of my life with them. ”
The ""Chango"" was always about having fun and dancing. He also liked to drink and meet friends where alcohol was often lacking. “I confess that I liked the fuck, but that situation made me think. The first thing I did was get away from alcohol. It was not right for a person who had made the commitment to take care of my two nieces and who had lost their dad. It happened like this and here I am. Happy to accompany their growth and education, ”said the first world champion who had the province in boxing.
For Milagros Banegas (the oldest of the nieces who was diagnosed with myelomeningocele), almost a couple of years ago it was a very special moment. He turned 15 and had the pride and joy of living and enjoying his party. “It was beautiful to see her fulfill her dream. I gathered silver from where I could and organized his birthday as I wanted to do it, ”said Cordoba, when he remembers it, he puts on a face of emotion and happiness.
Boxing was always his life. As a child, his father Mario (also a former boxer) showed him at any street show or at other events where he exhibited his conditions and foreshadowed a great future. He came to participate in the traditional Corsicans that were made on Belgrano Avenue and with his brother ""Jhon"" offered an exhibition in a ring armed in a motorbike to represent the historic fights of Carlos Monzón and the Colombian Rodrigo Valdez.
“I always lost. The referee was my other brother José, ”says Córdoba, who at that time was very small and already painted to continue with the family's boxing tradition.
The talk with the man who lives in the Sarmiento neighborhood of this city was between stories and memories. But also of confessions before THE LIBERAL.
“I have three children who are from different mothers. One is working as a radiologist; the other one told me that he is practicingWhen I boxed in Córdoba and the rest is a woman who lives in the corner of my house and who also made me a grandfather. I have grandchildren, a boy and a woman, ”he added.
Córdoba's only regret is not having been with his children to raise them as his parents Marta and Mario did. ""I would have liked to be with them and raise them my way,"" he said.
Today the life of the former world champion takes place in the gym of the Club Colonel Suárez where he teaches recreational and competitive boxing. He does it in the time that he has free and that does not interfere with his labor obligations.
“I work at the sports secretariat of the province and as I said at the beginning I live with my mother. I have my girlfriend Marta who accompanies me at all times and a family that I don't change for anyone, not even for the title of the world. ” l
