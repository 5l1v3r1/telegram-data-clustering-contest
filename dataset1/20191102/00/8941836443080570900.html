      <p>12 a.m.</p>
      <p>A fifth person has died as a result of a Halloween night shooting at an Airbnb rental in Northern California.</p>
      <p>The Contra Costa County Sheriff’s Office announced late Friday night that 19-year-old Oshiana Tompkins of Vallejo and Hercules died at a local hospital. The statement posted on social media did not specify when Tompkins was pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>Tompkins’ death brings the total fatalities in the Thursday night shooting to five. Authorities have identified the other victims as 22-year-old Tiyon Farley of Antioch, 24-year-old Omar Taylor of Pittsburg, 23-year-old Ramon Hill Jr., and 29-year-old Javin County.</p>

        <p>Witnesses described people running in terror as shots rang out Thursday night at a rented four-bedroom home in Orinda.</p>
        <p>About 100 people showed up for a party that apparently had been advertised on the internet.</p>
        <p>Two guns were found at the scene.</p>
        <p>The home was rented through Airbnb by a woman who claimed that she wanted a dozen family members with asthma to escape the smoke from a giant wildfire in neighboring Sonoma County, according to a person with knowledge of the transaction.</p>
        <p>The Airbnb ad banned parties and the city has a 13-person limit on occupancy for short-term rentals.</p>
        <p>Airbnb says it’s “urgently investigating” what happened.</p>
