[스포츠조선 이원만 기자] 현존하는 미국 프로농구(NBA) 최고의 슈터인 스테판 커리(31·골든스테이트 워리어스)의 예술적인 슛을 당분간 못 보게 될 전망이다. 손바닥 골절 수술로 최소 3개월은 결장이다. 커리의 소속팀인 골든스테이트는 2일(한국시각) 커리가 LA의 한 병원에서 스티브 신 박사에 의해 손바닥 수술을 받았다고 발표했다. 이로 인해 커리는 앞으로 최소 3개월간은 회복에 전념해야 할 듯 하다. 워리어스 구단은 커리의 상태에 대한 업데이트를 3개월 뒤에 한다고 밝혔다. 커리는 지난 10월 31일 피닉스 선즈와의 홈경기에서 왼손 골절 부상을 입었다. 검진 결과 손바닥의 두 번째 뼈(중수골)이 부러진 것으로 나타났고, 곧바로 수술을 받았다. 일단 부상 자체는 그리 치명적인 것은 아니다. 손바닥 뼈는 잘 붙는데다 큰 후유증도 없는 편이다. 하지만 재활이 중요하다. 특히나 예민한 슛 감각을 지닌 커리의 플레이 스타일을 고려하면 재활 과정에서 손바닥의 어색함을 얼마나 지우느냐가 관건이 될 듯 하다. 골든스테이트는 이번 시즌 초반 부상악재에 빠졌다. 커리 외에도 케본 루니와 제이콥 에반스, 클레이 탐슨 등이 줄줄이 부상자 명단에 들어가 있다. 그 탓에 시즌 초반 1승3패로 부진하다. 이원만 기자 wman@sportschosun.com ▲ 명품 골프 풀세트' 65% 단독 할인 '10세트'한정 45만원! 판매▲ 나르샤 “진짜 젖만 안 물렸지…” 발언에 가인 당황 ‘폭소’▲ 배우→무속인 정호근 수입 공개 “하루 5명, 복비 최저 5만원”▲ 선우은숙 “이혼 전, 이영하 팬티에 립스틱 묻은 자국 발견” 깜짝▲ 태진아, 강남에 “3000평 땅 선물…이상화 스케이트장 세우자”좋아요 0 Copyrights ⓒ 스포츠조선. 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지

Argentine Rafael Grossi: The priority of Iran's program
""Veteran of nuclear diplomacy"" succeeds Amano at the head of the IAEA

02 Nov 2019

Following the selection of the IAEA board of governors as new director general, questions have been raised about the direction of the Argentine diplomat, Rafael Mariano Grossi, 58, who enjoys the support of the United States, over the crisis related to the nuclear crisis with Iran. Grossi, a veteran of nuclear diplomacy, received the full endorsement of the IAEA's 35-nation board of governors this week in the Austrian capital, Vienna, where the IAEA is based. However, he won the third round of the election in an extraordinary competitive race with 24 votes to 10 against Cornell Verotta, the Romanian who has been acting acting director-general since the death of former Japanese director-general Yukiya Amano in July. Grossy will only start his work after the IAEA's 171-member General Conference approves his appointment at an extraordinary session on December 2. Diplomats revealed that Washington has led a low-profile campaign to select Argentine diplomat Rafael Grossi as director general. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is expected to begin its four-year mission on December 3. Unusually, this time the EU countries were not united behind a single European candidate for the post; Grose served as chief of staff during the Amano era between 2010 and 2013. Since then, he has served as Argentina's ambassador to the IAEA, working with its member states and partners to promote safe, sound and peaceful nuclear technologies and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Grossy also spent several years as a senior official of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. He recently led an international review of the NPT aimed at ending the spread of nuclear weapons. Rafael Grossi was born in Buenos Aires in 1961. He graduated in 1983 at the Pontifical Catholic University in the capital with a Bachelor of Science degree. Political. In 1985, he joined the Argentine diplomatic corps. In 1997, he obtained a master's degree from the University of Geneva and a Ph.D. in international relations, history and international politics. He has extensive experience and began his experience in the nuclear field through cooperation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Argentine company INVAP. He chaired the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on the International Register of Arms between 1997 and 2000. He later became an adviser to the United Nations Assistant Secretary-General on disarmament. From 2002 to 2007, he was chief of staff of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. During his tenure at the Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he was Director General of Political Coordination, then Ambassador to Belgium and Representative of his country to the United Nations Office at Geneva. From 2010 to 2013, he was Deputy Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency. He was appointed by Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (now Vice-President) as Ambassador to Austria and international organizations based in Vienna, also to be Ambassador to Slovakia and Slovenia. He considered running for election against Yukiya Amano to adopt tougher stances on Iran, especially after adopting increasingly problematic behavior for the agency charged with overseeing nuclear activities worldwide. In the context of an escalation with the United States, Iran has promised to take new measures in early November to move away from what the JCPOA - the 2015 nuclear deal it signed with the so-called ""P5 + 1"" The five permanent members of the UN Security Council include the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China, as well as Germany. The plan has imposed strict but temporary restrictions on Iran's nuclear program. Western diplomats fear these are the most significant Iranian violations to date. When he receives his duties in dIn December, Grose will oversee an IAEA investigation into allegations that Iran has kept radioactive material in a secret location in the Tehran suburb of Turkozabad, insisting that its nuclear activity has always been for civilian purposes. Critics of the IAEA, the global center for cooperation in nuclear applications, energy, science and technology, believe that Amano's team was not firm enough to investigate Iran's nuclear efforts. They have made it clear on more than one occasion that they want IAEA experts to inspect suspected sites and interview people named in some documents to see if they are still involved in illicit nuclear weapons-related work. I followed allegations about the suspected Turkuzabad website, noting that Cornel Verota, the acting director-general, publicly called on Tehran in September to stop obstructing IAEA investigations into suspected activities there. IAEA officials confirm that they have visited Iranian non-nuclear facilities, including universities, where weapons research can be conducted. In any case, diplomats do not expect major shifts during Grossi's tenure on the most important issues of the IAEA, such as monitoring the implementation of the JCPOA with Iran or seeking the return of IAEA inspectors to North Korea, which expelled the inspectors in 2009. He described the change of leadership as an ""opportunity to reevaluate,"" in a hint that he is planning a moderate rather than radical reform. With regard to the investigation of Iranian nuclear activities, Grossi said he ""intends to abide by the mandate given by the IAEA member states in close association with the parties concerned,"" adding that ""the issue is of great importance to all."" The Argentine diplomat also told the Wall Street Journal that he was ""prepared to pursue what is acceptable, but that it is not my program."" “We need to adapt. We need to evolve. ”Grose cautions against over-linking the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the Iranian nuclear deal, which has been in"" serious trouble ""since the Trump administration announced in 2018 that the United States would withdraw from it, seeking to replace a broader and tougher deal. It also focuses on Iran's ballistic missile program and its regional behavior. At the same time, he stresses that ""the agency should not be part of the political debate,"" concluding that ""it would be wrong to define the agency with the JCPOA or any other political agreement."" He added: ""We have to be firm and honest at the same time,"" in monitoring Iran's activities. Many pressures that reflect what he did in his speeches during the last rounds of voting; he avoided mentioning by name to Iran but stressed the IAEA safeguards regarding verification. Responding to a question on the impact of the Director-General, he stated that he “sets priorities and heads inspectors” in the IAEA, which has two aspects: one is to promote safety standards and technical cooperation. , The other my watch, Valuka He searches. He referred to special cases, named Iran, North Korea and Syria, where the Director-General would determine the nature of the inspections and subsequent reports. He acknowledged that ""this is a great responsibility,"" recalling the ""great pressure"" exerted by the five permanent members of the Security Council, each having a different interest from the interests of others. He explained that ""in the case of Iran, for example, a group of countries in the Council want firm standards from the International Atomic Energy Agency, while the other group does not want any exaggeration from the IAEA."" He noted that ""there are ongoing initiatives to seek stability, either through this nuclear agreement or through amendment."" In the North Korean file, there is ""a different situation because there is already proliferation"" of nuclear weapons in this country, according to Grossi, who stressed that the IAEA depends «Only on intelligence and satellites». ""The agency must remain on alert, because if a political agreement is reached on the inspection, there should be inspectors in Pyongyang within 10 hours,"" he said.
