02 Nov 2019 by Rob Hayes
LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Shopping for groceries can be expensive and can sometimes even increase debt.But there are ways to save on your next trip to the grocery store.Almost all groceries stores have store cards that give you discounts at checkout, according to Kimberly Palmer of NerdWallet, a personal finance website and app.Buying store brand items instead of other brand name items can save you money because the store brand items tend to be cheaper, said Palmer.Palmer also suggests that those loyal customers who shop at one particular store look into getting a store credit card because card holders will often get cash back on their purchases.Some grocery store chains such as Ralphs offer their card members special discounts at select gas stations. That can be an even bigger incentive when gas prices are on the rise.There are also other credit card companies that offer discounts on gas purchases. American Express Blue Cash Preferred gives customers 3% cash back on gas purchases.If you're looking for the cheapest places to purchase gas, you're in luck because there are apps like Gas Buddy, designed to help locate the best deals.""The price of gas can actually vary, not just by city, but also by neighborhood. So, you do want to always compare - where is the cheapest place to buy gas,"" said Palmer.Some stores also offer discounts through their very own app. So you might want to download and scan your favorite store's app at checkout to save even more when shopping, according to Palmer.

Brazilian police arrest one of the most prominent human smugglers in the world

02 Nov 2019

The Brazilian federal police said they have arrested Bangladeshi-born Saifullah al-Ma'mun, whom authorities consider to be one of the world's leading human traffickers.
Brazilian police arrested members of a group allegedly involved in a massive plot to smuggle people to the United States during an operation on Thursday after cooperating with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency.
Mamoun and his group were smuggling people from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan to Brazil and then to the United States, police said.
Police said the group was charging each of those from Asia about 50,000 riyals ($ 12,524) for trying to take him to the United States.
Several people have been arrested in São Paulo, where al-Ma'mun lives and in three other Brazilian cities, and police have also frozen 42 bank accounts that the group used to finance their activities.
The US Department of Justice said there were allegations that al-Ma'mun was sheltering people from Southeast Asia in Sao Paulo and arranged their travel through a network of smugglers operating in Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico.
Mamoun entered Brazil six years ago as a refugee and lived in the Bras district of São Paulo where immigrants from around the world live.
