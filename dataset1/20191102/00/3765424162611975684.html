      <h1>Good news if you hate being added to WhatsApp groups</h1>

      <p>WhatsApp has a new feature that will stop people from automatically adding you to those annoying WhatsApp groups.</p>
      <p>WhatsApp is rolling out a new feature that will stop people from automatically adding you to those annoying WhatsApp groups.</p>
      <p>If you activate the feature, friends and strangers will not be able to add you to group chats without getting your permission first.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6881573/The-end-annoying-WhatsApp-groups-Update-stops-people-adding-without-permission.html">Daily Mail</a>, people will now have three options to choose from in their settings: “nobody”, “my contacts” or “everyone”.</p>
      <p>They’ve introduced the invite system because group chats can lead to awkwardness when people want to leave a group they have no interest in, a WhatsApp spokesperson told the publication. This can lead to resentment among friends who may have added you without your consent.</p>
      <p>“This is a significant update for WhatsApp and a frequently requested feature that will limit abuse and keep people’s phone numbers private.”</p>
      <p>This new feature has already been rolled out to some users and will be available worldwide within the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Steps on how to activate the new option:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Make sure you have the updated version of WhatsApp on your phone then choose from one of three options in your settings:</p>
      <p>*Picking “Everyone” will let anyone add you to a group without asking you for permission.</p>
      <p>*Choosing “My Contacts” will limit group-adding to people in your phone contacts – forcing everyone else to invite you first.</p>
      <p>*Choosing “Nobody” will require everyone to ask for your permission before you can be added to a group.</p>
