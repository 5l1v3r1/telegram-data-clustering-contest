The Galician community registered between January and July a total of 51 strikes, in which 11,190 people participated.
These figures are derived from the latest officers published by the Ministry of Labor, Migration and Social Security and consulted by Europa Press.
In absolute numbers, Galicia is the fifth autonomous community in which more strikes were registered between January and July of this year, surpassed by the Basque Country (157), Catalonia (93), the Community of Madrid and Navarra, both with 69 each a.
It has also been the fifth community in number of workers participating in the strikes, being behind Catalonia (47,772), Basque Country (41,950), the Community of Madrid (25,637), and Andalusia (14,828).
The information offered refers to all strikes and lockouts that have been known, whether or not there is prior administrative record of your call, except those that do not imply days not worked, such as so-called heat strikes; those of less than one hour duration, those that refer to conventionally non-productive activities - such as student strikes - and those that affect groups without the right to strike, such as military personnel and the Security Forces and Bodies of the State.
These data have been accounted for by the Ministry of Labor based on the questionnaires that complete, for each of the strikes or business closures, the competent administrative units of the autonomous communities and the ministry itself.
The strike unit, the object of the statistics, is associated with the unit of convocation, regardless of its territorial, sectoral and temporal scope, as well as its continuous or discontinuous nature, as detailed by the Ministry.
