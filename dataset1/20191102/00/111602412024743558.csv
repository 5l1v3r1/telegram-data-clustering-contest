Mutual funds wrap: Infosys whistleblower complaint dents October returns of IT-related schemes
Infosys whistleblower letter largely dented returns of IT funds last month.

02 Nov 2019

All scheme categories in the equity segment have delivered positive return in October barring funds-related to information technology (IT).
Among all, the best performing category was pharmaceutical funds. This category delivered an average of 7.24 percent in returns last month.
In comparison, S&P BSE Healthcare Index rose 6.46 percent.

The second best performer were the banking-related mutual fund schemes that fetched 5.87 percent average returns during the review period.
Corporate earnings faring better than what most analysts' had predicted, along with less negativity in management commentary for the upcoming quarters, led to optimism among investors over earnings and market returns and helped most of the sectors to add gains, according to the fund managers.
Infosys whistleblower fallout
The worst performer across all scheme categories were IT funds that delivered negative 0.55 percent average returns during the review period.
However, it managed to outperform the BSE IT Index, which fell 2.53 percent last month.
According to fund managers, Infosys' whistleblower letter largely dented returns of IT funds last month.
On October 22, shares of the IT bellwether company plunged over 15 percent, registering its biggest fall in over six years on the stock market after anonymous whistleblowers accused the Chief Operating Officer Salil Parekh and Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy of ""unethical practices.""
Concerns had emerged whether any person or group of people, who knew about the whistleblower's letter to the board of Infosys, bought put options in the equity derivatives segment.
These put options would have fetched large profits during that week since the share price fell steeply in reaction to the revelation of the letter.
A board member of Infosys had received the whistleblower letter on September 30. But it was only on October 21 that the company disclosed to the market the fact that such a letter was received, but without providing details of the letter's contents.Not sure which mutual funds to buy?

concert review
A masterful Heras-Casado sits chair with the València Orchestra
02 Nov 2019 by Joaquín Guzmán
VALENCIA. This week was the first time that the Granada director works with the Valencia orchestra, and the meeting could not have been happier. All that remains is to hope that it will be repeated in the future, which will not be easy in view of the very busy international agenda of the teacher. It was easy to verify that Heras-Casado had not come to Valencia to make another bolus, and from the first minute of the rehearsals he rolled up his sleeves and subjected the musicians to an intensity that this Thursday has turned into an evening to remember.
Piano Concerto No. 1


The one hundred and five orchestral bars that serve as an introduction to this first concert of Beethovenian literature serve to place us still in the area of influence of

As you know, the upper auditorium is not the best room in the world, and this time it was the rope that was most affected by a reverberation that is not a good ally and that blurred the line of the fast scales of the string that contains the introduction of This first move. It shows in the contrasted more historicist dynamics that heirs to the great tradition of the twentieth century, that Heras-Casado comes from ancient music. It is difficult to remember in recent years a translation of these characteristics to our musicians, who demonstrated a great level of adaptation to the particular vision of the Spanish director, who was not limited to a routine interpretation but carried out a very personal reading of the work . That is still a risk and more with an orchestra that is not accustomed to these readings and faces with better results the post-romantic repertoire than the classic. Although the interpretation was great, the results were somewhat weighed down by the fact that the place of the rehearsals had a very different acoustics from that of the upper auditorium. It is a handicap that will have to be fought this and the next season. The Venezuelan pianist moved through the dangerous passages in a crystalline, precious way thanks to its refined technique. A room with a drier acoustics would have benefited its transparent pianism. Especially inspired during the entire concert, she had the best moments in a slow time to cut her breath thanks also to a luxury accompaniment commanded by Heras-Casado who did not just follow the protagonist. Great success that lasted in the tip. Montero is an artist internationally recognized for her improvisations. As usual in his concerts, after the concert he asked the audience for a tonadilla with which to improvise a piece. It is not the first time he has been asked to improvise the Venezuelan theme Alma llanera. Montero developed all his talent in an improvisation in which he went through the most diverse musical styles with the simple background melody. Extraordinary

Anton Bruckner Symphony number 3
The music critic Norman Lebrecht was raised in his work The myth of the teacher, in a rather sensationalist way, his doubt about whether orchestra conductors really served something, and in any case if the orchestra what really conditioned him was the charisma and the auctoritas of certain directors, who dragged behind them a halo of magnetism that inevitably influenced musicians. This Thursday's concert makes very clear the free comments of the English critic. The sound of an orchestra changes mainly by work and talent, by the ability to transmit both to the musicians by the conductor during rehearsals, and by their willingness to put those observations into practice. Already a leading member of the orchestra of Valencia had warned me, during the week, about the very high quality of rehearsals with the Granada teacher from the minute one of getting on the podiumor and the amount of things they were learning. When a director leads the international Heras-Casado career, it will be for something. So many great orchestras cannot be wrong. The results were not long in coming. The change of sound of an orchestra leads us to consider to the point the difference in the quality of musicians between the formations of a certain level is so much, or perhaps the quality of the directors. Of course, the great orchestras in which we all think have excellent soloists in their lecterns and in global terms are superior, but the difference is marked by the masters with whom the orchestras work. There was some fear about the fact that having rehearsed in a different room had a negative impact on the sound and dynamics but the first great crescendo raised with an amazing tension and intensity by musicians and director was already indicative of what was coming upon us. Heras-Casado contemplates the work as a whole, from the global sound, and for this in Bruckner there are several premises that one cannot jump: the string has an essential weight and Heras-Casado asks precisely the weight of the bow on the instrument that It translates into a large and dense sound capable of covering the whole set including metals. The training, in this sense, did not sound like we are used to. Searching for a global sound is not at odds with finding all the meaning of each one of the phrases and Heras-Casado takes care of this task, also achieving it. Secondly, wood is fundamental in the contrast between the gigantism of corals and the lyricism that this music also gives off. There was also the miracle that these were made to be heard in those small gaps that the masterly Brucknerian writing allows. The adage is the “Wagnerian” movement of this work with quotes to La Walkiria, but it is not one of the happiest movements of the work nor from the collection of adages of the Austrian master. It seems that the figure of his idolized Richard Wagner, the work's owner, weighs too much. Except for a rather rough first entry of the woods, its course was within excellence. The Scherzo was saved without technical problems although a tad of transparency would have been desirable. They began to give certain symptoms of fatigue: ""we are finished,"" a musician would tell me later. The requirement of Heras-Casado is maximum during the hour that this symphony lasts. The finale, a movement in which the Wagnerian echoes appear again, had its great moments in the contrasts between the mundane (polka) and the sad (corals) as Bruckner himself would define, and the coda in which he brilliantly shines triumphantly the main theme modified with respect to the beginning of the work, Heras-Married brought it with enormous brilliance although without retaining the time, something that -is a matter of taste- I would have liked
