Iraq .. Thwart Iranian hegemony
The October Youth Revolution underlined the growing and strong rejection of Iranian interference in the Iraqi affairs.

Since the clerics' seizure of power in 1979, their goal has been to become a regional power that controls the Muslim world.
To expand its power and influence, Iran has arming and supporting proxies in Lebanon, the Gaza Strip, Yemen, and its militias in Iraq and Syria.
Iraq is a crucial element in the project of Iranian hegemony. The aim of Iran is to develop a strong political and military base that enables it to dictate its policies to the Iraqi political decision-maker, and to interfere in Iraq's internal and external affairs to promote Iranian interests.
Will Iran succeed in completing its land corridor?
By analyzing the current situation in Iraq, there are developments that frustrate the Iranian plan to complete and maintain control of the corridor.
Not far from memory, the mass demonstrations and protests that broke out and spread quickly in southern Iraq in mid-July 2018, it seemed to have damaged this possibility, where she explained that most Iraqis reject Iran's growing influence and interference in their country, and we all remember the protesters burning the Iranian consulate in Basra.
There were other indications that Iraqis were rejecting Iranian influence. When Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced plans to build a fence along the 600-kilometer-long Iraqi-Syrian border, the aim was to prevent the Iranian army from crossing to and from Iran. Syria, and then Abadi issued a bold statement saying ""will not sacrifice the Iraqi people on the altar of Iran.""
In contrast, the Trump administration recognizes the threat posed by the Iranian corridor to the GCC, Jordan, Israel and US interests in the region, which explains the deployment of US military bases in eastern Syria, as well as the Iraqi-Syrian border, and the reimposition of sanctions on Tehran.
With this in mind, the Iranian regime continues to try to achieve its plan despite the US sanctions, which are expected to increase and deepen the Iranian financial crisis, and does not think about how to meet domestic challenges and appease a furious and deeply dissatisfied with its policies. Expansive.
The October Youth Revolution confirmed the growing and strong rejection of Iranian intervention in Iraq, as it became clear to everyone that the Iranian expansionist project is an integral part of the battle over Iraq's identity and independence, and that this battle will continue to curb Iranian influence and interference in Iraq. Revealed serious concerns about the future influence of his country in the region, especially with the continuation of Lebanese demonstrations for the second week in a row.
