NOTÍCIA
Transcrição da conversa entre Trump e Zelensky está incompleta, diz testemunha
02 Nov 2019 by O Povo
Uma testemunha da ligação entre os presidentes Donald Trump, dos Estados Unidos, e Volodymyr Zelensky, da Ucrânia, disse à Câmara dos Deputados americana que a transcrição da conversa apresentada pela Casa Branca - e que está no centro do processo de impeachment contra Trump - demonstra de maneira correta o teor do diálogo, mas está incompleta.Na quinta-feira, o tenente-coronel do Exército dos EUA Alexander Vindman, que acompanhou a conversa, disse à Câmara dos Deputados que propôs revisões à transcrição com base nas próprias anotações, mas que elas não foram incluídas na versão final do documento. Segundo disse uma fonte que acompanhou o depoimento ao Dow Jones, Vindman afirmou que duas frases foram deixadas de fora da transcrição: uma na qual havia referência de gravações de Biden e outra, na qual aparecia o nome da Burisma Group, empresa na qual o filho do ex-vice-presidente trabalhava. Vindman afirmou que não considera que essas mudanças sejam importantes e que não acredita que as frases tenham sido deixadas de fora por razões erradas. Na conversa, Trump pediu que Zelensky investigasse o candidato à presidência pelo Partido Democrata e ex-vice-presidente do país, Joe Biden, bem como a eleição de 2016. Mas o documento de cinco páginas divulgado pelo governo americano não é uma transcrição literal da ligação de 30 minutos entre os dois chefes de Estado, e sim uma reconstrução por meio de softwares de reconhecimento de fala e de ""anotações e lembranças"" de pessoal da Casa Branca que estava presente. Outro funcionário da Casa Branca que ouviu a conversa, Tim Morrison, por outro lado, afirmou que a transcrição demonstra ""precisamente e completamente"" o teor da conversa.

‘We love you South Africa’: Kolisi pride after World Cup w
02 Nov 2019 by STEVE DOUGLAS
YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) - Siya Kolisi grabbed the Webb Ellis Cup with his big hands, gave it a kiss and hoisted it high as fireworks exploded and his teammates - black and white - rejoiced behind him.
A blowout victory in the Rugby World Cup final for the Springboks.
Yet another transcendent moment for post-apartheid South Africa.
Led by its first black captain in the Springboks’ 128-year rugby history, South Africa’s multi-racial squad swept to a record-tying third World Cup title by overpowering England in a 32-12 victory on Saturday.
“We have so many problems in our country,” the 28-year-old Kolisi said. “A team like this - we come from different backgrounds, different races - came together with one goal.”


He thanked the people on the farms, in the taverns, in the townships and in the streets.
“We love you, South Africa,” an emotional Kolisi said, “and we can achieve anything if we work together as one.”
Kolisi was shaking with adrenalin as he belted out the national anthem before kickoff in Yokohama and was then at the heart of a massive effort by the Boks forwards, who brutalized England with their traditional power at the set piece to seize control of the game.
The English were driven backward at the scrum. Their passing was sloppy. The kicks were overhit. What happened to the team that demolished the All Blacks in the semifinals?

Yet, at 18-12 with 20 minutes left, the final was still up for grabs.
Then the Springboks opened up, showing the other side of their game and scoring late tries out wide through wingers Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe.
Mapimpi kicked ahead from the left wing and was on hand to receive a pass from center Lukhanyo Am to race over near the posts in the 67th minute.
Kolbe’s try was even better, the small right winger scampering down the touch line before stepping inside England captain Owen Farrell and running through unchecked in the 74th.
The celebrations could start early for the South African fans inside the International Stadium and back home, on a poignant night for a country still trying to fully emerge from the apartheid era.
“We had the privilege of giving people hope,” South Africa coach Rassie Erasmus said, “not the burden of giving people hope.”
And Erasmus saved some special words for his captain.
“It is easy to talk about going through hard times and struggling to get opportunities,” Erasmus said, “but it is tough when there are days when you didn’t have food or couldn’t go to school or didn’t have shoes to wear.
“When you sit down and think about it, there was a stage when Siya didn’t have food to eat. Yes, that is the captain and he led South Africa to hold this Cup.”
It was 24 years ago when the Springboks won their first World Cup title in front of Nelson Mandela, a year after he became president in a democratic election after decades of racial segregation and his own imprisonment for 27 years.
Twelve years later, they won it again - also against England - and it has been another 12-year gap to their third.
While the All Blacks have also won the biggest prize in rugby three times, they have played in all nine editions of the World Cup. South Africa has only played in the tournament seven times, having been barred from the 1987 and ‘91 tournaments as part of sporting sanctions during the apartheid era.
It is three wins from three finals for the Springboks, who finally scored a try in a title match.
England never led in the final and its players slumped to the ground at the final whistle, lock Maro Itoje hurling his scrum cap.
Maybe they did play their final last weekend, as some of their fans feared. Maybe beating Australia, New Zealand and South Africa in a two-week span was just too much to ask.
Coach Eddie Jones, an Australian brought in after the wreckage of the 2015 World Cup that England hosted but didn’t even get out of the pool stage, got the team to the top of the rankings - his first aim after taking charge.
But he couldn’t deliver a second title for England, after the class of 2003. Jones was also on the losing end in ‘03 as Australia’s coach in a final decided by a dropped goal in extra time.
“I thought they executed their plan brilliantly,” England flyhalf George Ford said of the Boks. “They just did a job on us.”
