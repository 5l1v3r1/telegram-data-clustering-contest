      <p>ROME (AP) - A brief suspension for discriminatory chants marred Roma’s 2-1 win over struggling Napoli in Serie A on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Referee Gianluca Rocchi made the decision in the second half after Roma fans aimed anti-territorial chants - which are treated in the same manner as racist chants - at Napoli. The game resumed after a few minutes.</p>
      <p>Rocchi had already ordered an announcement to be made over the Stadio Olimpico’s public address system asking fans to stop the chants.</p>
      <p>During the suspension, Rocchi gathered teams in the center circle, then Roma forward Edin Dzeko went over and encouraged fans to applaud rather than jeer the opposition.</p>
      <p>Roma led 2-0 at the time of the suspension with goals from Nicolò Zaniolo and Jordan Veretout.</p>

      <p>Shortly after the interruption, Arkadiusz Milik pulled one back for Napoli.</p>
      <p>Roma extended its unbeaten run to six matches and moved up to third place, one point ahead of Atalanta, which hosts Cagliari on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Napoli, which has earned just three points in its last five matches, dropped to seventh.</p>
      <p>Zaniolo put the hosts ahead with a shot from the edge of the area early on and Veretout added a second-half penalty.</p>

        <p>Also, Aleksandar Kolarov had a first-half penalty saved by Napoli goalkeeper Alex Meret then Roma defender Chris Smalling cleared a dangerous effort off the goal line with a bicycle kick.</p>
        <p>Napoli also hit the goal frame twice on a single action in a fast-paced first half, while Roma’s Justin Kluivert hit the bar after the break.</p>
        <p>Milik redirected a cross at the far post for Napoli’s goal, finishing off a swift counterattack.</p>
        <p>Roma ended with 10 men when Mert Çetin picked up his second yellow for a foul on Fernando Llorente. Milik’s ensuing free kick seven minutes into stoppage time was deflected way over the goal.</p>
