美國國防部新增「中國事務」官員，反映何種對台戰略思維？
02 Nov 2019, 00:44 by 《思想坦克》


我們想讓你知道的是與十九年前相比，現在台灣戰略圈講美日台說得震天價響，但台灣本身才是對何謂美日台三方合作最需要戰略自省的國家。



文：賴怡忠（讀錯書，入錯行，生錯時代的政治邊緣人）
美國防部最近有個組織改造引發議論。在國防部助理部長薛瑞福（Randall Schriver）底下，出現一個新的專門針對中國的副助理部長斯布拉加（Chad Sbragia）。薛瑞福是負責印度－太平洋的助理部長，旗下出現一個專門針對中國的副助理部長，這一方面顯示美國防部非常重視中國的挑戰，所以特對單一國家（中國），專設副助理部長。這也顯示美國2017「國家安全戰略」把中國視為全球戰略競爭者／對手／敵手，已經從概念、戰略向下變成政策，並反映在各部會的對中應對作為上。美國防部就特地為此騰出一個新的位子專門關注中國。
但如果看到在薛瑞福底下，除了對中國的副助理部長外，還有其他三位副助理部長。其中一位管阿富汗、巴基斯坦與中亞，另一位管南亞、東南亞與太平洋國家，剩下的一位主管包括日本、韓國、蒙古等東亞區域。猜猜看台灣在哪裡，台灣就歸在這個東北亞副助理部長的轄區，管中國之副助理部長沒管轄到台灣。而且不僅台灣不在管中國之副助理部長之轄區，連香港也不在中國副助理部長之下，而是與台灣一樣，歸在東亞副助理部長底下處理。
有人認為這表示川普（Donald Trump）政府正在執行美國不認台灣是中國一部分的政策，而為此大聲歡呼。但美國承認中國對香港的主權，但也沒將香港劃歸在中國副助理部長的管轄下，所以要把這個作為牽扯到美國對台灣的地位認定，可能會受挑戰。再說美國也從未承認台灣是中華人民共和國的一部分，因此也不太需要透過這個作為來彰顯美國不承認北京的一中原則。與其硬把這個國防部之組改與台灣地位相連結，我們更需要注意這個作為的背後，是反映了何種對台戰略思維。
把台灣放在美中台、日中台架構所形成的戰略困局
傳統上，台灣處理與美國以及與日本關係的主要思考架構，是沿著中國因素對於這兩個雙邊關係的影響而展開，即所謂對美的「美中台」，以及對日的「日中台」的這兩個三角架構。在這個架構下，台灣形同與中國競爭對美及對日關係，也形同在要求美、日在台、中兩邊有所取捨。
但因為美、日已經與中國建立正式外交關係，與台灣還是非正式關係，加上中國的影響力大，不是台灣一個小小的島嶼可以直接對抗。因此這個取捨一開始把台灣放在非常不利的位置，甚至會出現台美或是台日關係要有所提升，必須要在中美或是中日關係出現波折時才有機會。
要是說台美、台日關係在中美、中日關係不好時最有機會發展，其實也並不正確。因為日本與美國主理對台事務官員，往往也處理對中事務，在面對中美或是中日關係出現波折時的習慣性思考，這些官員是想盡辦法讓美中或日中關係回穩，而不是讓關係持續惡化。在這個時候任何發展與台灣關係的提案，反而會被認為是對已處於麻煩的美中或日中雙邊關係帶來新變數，而遭到否決。
更誇張的，是當這些雙邊關係回穩後，與台灣推進關係的提案也會被認為是無端翻攪好不容易回穩的雙邊關係，因此同樣被否決。結論是無論美、日與中國關係是否良好，推進與台灣的雙邊關係提案往往會被視為是對中關係的麻煩製造者，而不被採用。會出現突破，往往在事前已經耗費極大資源，且在非常偶然情形下才找到的機會。
這個困局之後導致在台灣外交界出現兩種主張。第一種可說以前外長錢復為代表，認為台灣國際空間的鑰匙在兩岸關係。只要兩岸關係良好，無論是中國因此不打壓，或是對方較不擔心中國的報復，這都會讓台灣與美日等國有機會提升雙邊關係。這個想法之後被馬英九發揚光大，提出其「兩岸高於外交」、「兩岸關係是上位關係」的主張。這個策略對於台灣的國際生存有無助益，中國是否因此而願意接受台灣的國際存在，相信經過馬英九八年執政的實驗後，大家都心知肚明。
另一種主張，是希望說服目標國可以將其對中關係與對台關係切割，將其視為兩組平行線，強調台灣不反對這些國家與中國發展良好關係，只要這些國家不會因此犧牲其與台灣的關係。李總統當時對美關係的主張基本上是如此。
但是在被中國飛彈嚇得一愣一愣的柯林頓總統（Bill Clinton）的第二個任期當中，先是美國安會有人提出兩岸簽署「中程協議」，在美國又提出對台灣國際參與有高度限制的「三不政策」。當時美國柯林頓政府急於降低對台承諾，以避免與中國發生衝突，使得台美關係日益惡化，甚至在「特殊國與國關係論」提出後，美方就有學者（當時是包道格）直接咒罵李總統為麻煩製造者。在這種情況下，李總統的主張很難持續。
顯然這兩個對應方式都有根本問題。前者仰賴中國願意接受台灣的國際存在，後者期待美國（或是日本）能夠明辨是非。不管是對老共的解讀有誤，或是當年的國際環境不允許，這兩股主要存在於外交體系的對外路線之爭當時沒有分出勝負。只是在二十年後，美國開始實踐李總統當年「切割對中與對台關係」的建議，並對馬政府的親中綏靖路線有所責難。

民進黨首次執政的台日關係是大未知數，但也刺激出新思維
這個存在於國民黨外交戰略的菁英爭論，因牽涉到具體的對外關係經營，對於還沒執政經驗的民進黨來說感覺相當對遙遠。民進黨2000年首度勝選時，外交關係是一張白紙，其外交白皮書也充滿了強烈的理想主義色彩。因沒有執政經驗，所以對於全球化、超國家等作用力充滿許多一廂情願的理解。除了對美關係還有些許理解與經營，對日本方面幾乎是一片空白。
這個狀況使得當時的日本相當緊張，因此台日關係在民進黨剛上任時充滿了高度的不確定。當時誰能想到八年後民進黨政府最自豪的對外關係，不是對美關係，反而是台日關係。正因為對日想像是一張白紙，民進黨反而在相對沒有包袱的狀況下，提出新的想像。民進黨政府對日關係的操作上，除了高度仰賴兩位有台獨聯盟身分的駐日大使之戮力經營外，本身也透過發展新的戰略思考而帶來新的空間。
民進黨當時的對日關係最具變革性的思維，是思考如何透過對美關係來槓桿其對日關係。但之後的台美與台日關係之進展，則又使民進黨政府反過來思考，如何利用其尚稱有不錯結果的對日關係，協助其已經陷入低迷狀況的對美關係。所謂的美日台新三角關係，就先是在經營台日與台美關係的戰術層次要求下發展，之後再經過內部改造，上升到戰略層次成為新的國安主張。
在分析日中台、美中台與美日台這三個三角架構時發現，不論是日中台或是美中台，台灣之所以陷入困境的因素是要與中國競爭對日與對美關係。這是因為日中台或是美中台架構，兩岸對美、日關係的各自發展都存在零和結構。意即在這個三邊關係下，台灣之得是中國之失，或是中國之得就是台灣之失。但是美日台三角關係卻呈現台美、美日、台日這三個關係都不是負向聯繫。這讓台美關係、日美關係、台日關係都可以一起正面發展。
此外，台灣對美國的中國通來說是其對中關係的爭議，但對美國的日本通來說卻是重要的對日戰略資產，類似的情況也發生在日本。因此引介美日台三角，就是要在論述結構上打破美、日中國通支配對台政策討論，並發展出新角度對台戰略關照的作為。使大家在討論涉台議題時，不會再單純從兩岸關係的角度看台灣，或是逕把台灣視為其與中國的雙邊關係之變數。
特別在對日關係的實際處理上，面對外務省中國幫為了穩定日中關係而傾向壓制與台關係的政策慣性，美日台三角的出現會使台灣出現在日本外務省美國通的戰略雷達上，使台灣有機會與日本外務省政策核心－對美關係／日美同盟經營者們，發展關係。這不僅可以使台灣有機會直接掌握日本外交核心圈的思考方式，也能與日本外交最高決策官僚有機會展開對話，這都是當時台灣夢寐以求而不可得的。特別在美國小布希政府當時，是由重視美日同盟高於對中關係的泛亞派當政，日本政策界的日美中三角等距論之聲浪因之平息，這也讓建構美日台三方合作的構想，更有成功的空間。
原先為了打破中國視角，並找出發展台美與台日關係新模式，而引介了美日台三角關係，這之後成為台灣安全戰略最重要的一組三角關係。之後美國歐巴馬政府的「面向亞洲／亞太再平衡」戰略出現「美日同盟加一」的複邊化發展，日本與美國也先後提出其印太戰略主張。這使得建立美日台三角不再是台灣單方面的期待，也有來自美國與日本有識之士的呼應。
美日台合作，是三個雙邊合作，還是台灣與美日同盟的雙邊合作？
現在這個三角關係，可能是台灣最關鍵的大國關係網絡。套句美台商會總裁韓儒伯（Rupert Hammond-Chambers）的說法，「更可能會成為台美與台日這兩組雙邊關係的力量倍增器（amplifier）。」但在執行時馬上會遇到一個關鍵問題：美日台合作是台美日三國就某些議題展開合作，還是台灣與美日同盟的雙邊合作？
前者相對簡單，因為可以直接選一些比較不具敏感性或是爭議性的議題展開合作互動。但我相信這不是台灣意圖啟動美日台三方合作，引介台美日三角關係進入台海戰略管理的初衷。畢竟為互動而互動，為了對外呈現美日台三角而硬鋪一個三方合作的場子，這會使這個三角關係無法永續。但如要能啟動後者，前提是美日願意以同盟方式與台灣展開互動與合作，這使得台灣掌握的權力變得很有限。
此外，如果要發展台灣與美日同盟的雙邊互動，台灣就有必要主動與經營美日同盟的管理者提出自己的主張，並提醒對方如何從美日同盟的角度看待台美與台日關係。
這裡會牽涉到三個動作，第一是台灣與美日同盟管理者的互動，包括其處理美日二加二會議的單位。台北也須建構台灣與美日安全保障協商會議（Security Consultative Committee）、美日安全保障小組會議（Security Subcommittee）的關聯。
第二與第三則是台灣對美國處理台美雙邊關係，以及對日本處理台日雙邊關係的管理者之溝通。後兩者在於透過溝通使美日同盟成為台美與台日關係管理的因素之一，使台美與台日這兩個雙邊關係不會一昧被中國因素支配。
在戰略上，這也是意圖使美日台關係出現「美日同盟加台灣」的效果。但在十七年前卻不存在將這個想法付諸實踐的空間。當時美日同盟的最主要關切，在地域上是北韓問題，其同盟管理還因為日本憲法的限制，針對1997年「美日同盟新指針」以「周邊事態」方式含括台灣的發展，更在日本國會成為爭論話題。時任自民黨幹事長的加藤紘一與當時官房長官對此的不同講法就是一例。當台灣是否含括在美日同盟的範圍，在日本內部都還有爭論時，發動美日同盟加台灣的時機就還沒到。
如果看美國推動其亞太同盟整合的發展來看，美日澳三方非正式的二加二會議是在2003年展開，但直到2007年才正式出現美日澳三方會議，成為美國推動其亞太雙邊同盟整合的首例。之後歐巴馬政府持續在亞太區域推動以「美日同盟」為主軸的三邊合作關係，包括美－日－韓、美－日－印度等。
在這個新倡議下，日本與澳大利亞的雙邊安全合作、以及日澳印三邊合作等，也出現進展。重要的是，雖然這些在性質上是三邊合作，但明顯是以美日同盟為核心推動的「美日同盟加一」。這個發展也顯示台灣在推動美日台方三方合作的路徑，可能還是要遵循「台灣與美日同盟」的雙邊關係會比較容易達標。
有趣的是，美國推動其亞太同盟的內部合作，把其雙邊同盟擴大為三邊，甚至是多邊的安全合作關係，是在歐巴馬政府第一任時期（也剛好是希拉蕊〔Hillary Clinton〕任國務卿，由坎貝爾〔Kurt Campbell〕擔任亞太助理國務卿的時候），但台灣卻是高唱「兩岸高於外交」的馬政府時代。當時台灣對日關係出現「兩岸合作保釣」的疑慮，還多次與日本海上保安廳船隻展開水砲戰。這與美國推動雙邊同盟整合、雙邊安全合作多邊化的趨勢背道而馳。
如果說扁政府時代想要推動美日台合作的想法，透過引進美日同盟以改變對台相對不利的美中台、日中台等三角架構，似乎在時序上有些過早。馬政府時代卻因其親中反日的意識形態，導致台灣錯失這樣的機會，還因推動兩岸軍事互信，以及姑息台灣退將公開且頻繁地前往中國，使得美台互信持續探底，也讓中國認為可以對台灣施加更多壓力。習近平在2013年於雅加達公開對蕭萬長說「兩岸政治分歧不能一代傳一代」的公開恫嚇，與這個戰略背景脫不了關係。
雖然台灣推動這個倡議似乎過早，但在美、日等有志之士戮力同心的倡議下，這個構想開始在美國的日本政策圈，以及日本的對美關係圈開始生根。由於這兩個圈子彼此互動頻繁，這個想法逐漸取得美日政策圈主流的認可。包括日本前駐泰大使岡崎久彥、美國前副國務卿阿米塔吉（Richard Armitage）、前國安會亞太資深主任葛林（Michael Green）等，都對這個構想相當支持。岡崎久彥大使不僅在日本多次提到台灣對日本的戰略重要性，也積極透過其主持的岡崎研究所，與台灣智庫和美國的日本政策專家們，多次就如何推動美日台三方合作舉行研討會。
在美、日的中國通們對此倡議極端拒斥的情形下，當時會議多像是傳教士對政策圈人士的講道會或是說明會。接受這些「講道」的多是當時的年輕官僚或是資淺政策幕僚。但在十多年後日美政策環境出現改變，當時這些中級官員與幕僚們之後也登上高位後，這樣的構想逐漸出現實踐的空間。

韓儒伯建議日本仿造美國國防組改，以有效發展台日安保合作
歐巴馬政府在第一任時，在亞太助理國務卿坎貝爾發動的面向亞洲（Pivot Toward Asia）之策略下，推動整合美國的亞太雙邊同盟關係。雖然坎貝爾於歐巴馬第二任時不再續任官職，但歐巴馬第二任卻出現逐步調整對台政策，把美台與美中關係分開的趨勢。這意味著美國對台關係不必然是美國對中關係的次關係。
華府當時也開始多次提醒言必稱「台灣不做美中關係麻煩製造者」的馬政府，美台關係有其與中國無關的自我邏輯與必要性。只是當時奉行「兩岸高於外交」，以為搞好兩岸就可以搞定美國的馬政府，對華府的呼籲置若罔聞。直到蔡政府上台後才看到台灣對這個呼籲有較正面回應。
之後川普政府發表國安報告，根本翻轉了過去四十年來的美國對中戰略。川普嚴肅面對美中競爭的實質，甚至還發動了在經濟、科技等領域的競爭，決定對中國銳實力國際滲透展開反擊。在這個框架下架構的印太戰略，提出了美國要對焦中國展開長期競爭，美國就更以不同方式看待台灣。美台關係在此不僅要單獨看待，台灣更是美國與中競爭的最關鍵前線，甚至會是對中競爭的成敗關鍵。
在這個框架下，美國更願意傾聽台灣對雙邊關係發展的建議／抱怨，想要台美關係能擺脫美中關係挾持的主張，就會得到更善意的對待。特別是牽涉到華府官僚組織面，因為這是美國可以操之在己處理的。
薛瑞福把台灣從主管中國副助理部長的轄區，移置主管東北亞的副助理部長之轄下，在操作上可以免除官僚慣性對台美關係所造成的問題。不論台灣歸在哪個副助理部長轄下，提升台美關係中國一定會抱怨。而對中副助理部長的主要任務是處理好美國對中關係，自然會把任何提升台美關係的要求，視為要以傷害美中關係為代價的麻煩。如果對台關係歸在對中副助理部長轄下，為了避免台灣成為美中關係的變數，就會對提升台美關係的作為消極以對。
但如果是東北亞副助理部長來看待台美關係時，因為這對處理美日關係有一定幫助，對美國其他區域同盟或是夥伴也不是個負面因素。因此對提升台美合作的建議在態度上就會比較積極。這因不同組織隸屬所帶來的態度變化，對於尚缺乏堅實制度的台美關係經營來說，影響就遠比美國其他具歷史與規模的同盟關係更深遠。
正是在知道機制所可能帶來的影響，美台商會總裁韓儒伯日前在一場「2049計畫」主辦的美日台會議上就公開建議，日本可以參照薛瑞福的嘗試，也展開內部對台灣與中國的官僚管理機制變革，以正視中國的影響，並有效增進對台關係。
由於薛瑞福正是當時美國對日政策圈的一員，也與岡崎久彥大使及岡崎研究所等熟識，而其對五角大廈的組改作為，與先前台美日會議中有關對台政策的處理建議方向相當一致，只是過去直接談美日台，現在則是透過印太戰略逐步落實。

台灣反而是這三方最需進行戰略內省的國家
與十九年前相比，現在台灣戰略圈講美日台說得震天價響，但台灣本身才是對何謂美日台三方合作最需要戰略自省的國家。
首先，如果對推動美日台的戰略概念有承諾，且不願讓台灣在認知上回到與中國爭奪對美日關係的軌道上，對美與對日關係的分析就不能固守在美中台與日中台的架構。美日台三角關係中，只把中國視為一個會影響台日與台美關係的因素；和把中國視為台美、台日互動架構一部分的美中台、日中台三角關係，是非常不同的。
其次，在對美關係與對日關係上，如何有意識地運用日本與美國來增進對美及對日關係，更是讓台美日三角關係如何具體化到三方合作的關鍵。民進黨政府在第一任時，在運用對美關係以促進對日關係上有些許進展，但在運用對日關係以協助對美關係上則沒有效果。
會有這樣發展的因素固然很多，但當時台灣處理對美與對日關係，在外交體系是屬於兩個不同團隊。因為種種歷史與組織的原因（例如日本屬亞太司，美國屬北美司），彼此很少溝通。加上處理對美關係的外交菁英，對台日關係在對美事務可以扮演什麼角色也心存遲疑，也因日常業務的慣性，使其對美國的對日政策缺少關注，本身對當時美日同盟的進展也不甚了解，其對美業務仍以美中台三角架構的視角看待。這些都對台灣整合其對美日關係的管理產生障礙。以致於在扁政府後期，因對美關係已經變得十分惡劣，彼此互信不足，就算當時日本的安倍首相願意幫忙，整體情勢也變得很難處理。
如果要避免當年問題再度出現，台灣不僅要有意識地將對日與對美關係經營進行整合，仔細研讀美國對日以及日本對美政策演變的軌跡，並爬梳其政策人脈關鍵。台灣更要在台海議題的討論上積極引入美日同盟，使其成為美、日與其他國際談論台海維和政策的重要因素，同時主動尋求與美日同盟發展機制合作。更重要的是，台灣須把過去在國安外交的事務官中種種「兩岸高於外交」的政策慣性徹底根除，包括會為了擔心中國反應，而有意降低與日本互動頻率以及延緩與美日同盟發展合作的想法等。
最後，是否可考慮利用薛瑞福對國防部組改的契機，讓台灣的外交與國安、情報體系也有類似變革，幫助台灣更有效處理對美日關係，以及發展台美日三方合作呢？

The US Department of Defense has added ""China Affairs"" officials to reflect what is strategic thinking about Taiwan?
02 Nov 2019, 00:44 by ""Think Tank""


What we want you to know is that compared with 19 years ago, Taiwan’s strategic circle now speaks of the price of the US, Japan and Taiwan, but Taiwan itself is the country that most needs strategic introspection for the cooperation between the US, Japan and Taiwan.



Text: Lai Yizhong (reading the wrong book, entering the wrong line, the political marginal people in the wrong age)
The US Department of Defense recently had an organizational reform that sparked debate. Under the Assistant Secretary of Defense Randall Schriver, a new Deputy Assistant Secretary for China, Chad Sbragia, appeared. Xue Ruifu is the assistant minister responsible for India-Pacific. He has a deputy assistant minister who specializes in China. This aspect shows that the US Department of Defense attaches great importance to China's challenges, so it is specially designed for a single country (China). This also shows that the US National Security Strategy of 2017 regards China as a global strategic competitor/opponent/adversary. It has been changed from concept and strategy to policy, and is reflected in the central response of various ministries. The US Department of Defense has specifically vacated a new seat for this purpose.
However, if you see Xue Ruifu, in addition to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of China, there are three other deputy assistant ministers. One of them is in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia, and the other is in South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Pacific. The remaining heads include East Asia, including Japan, South Korea and Mongolia. Guess where Taiwan is, Taiwan is in the jurisdiction of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Northeast Asia, and the Deputy Assistant Minister of China does not have jurisdiction over Taiwan. Moreover, not only does Taiwan not be in the jurisdiction of the deputy assistant minister of China, but even Hong Kong is not under the deputy assistant minister of China, but like Taiwan, it is handled under the Deputy Assistant Minister of East Asia.
Some people think that this means that the Donald Trump government is implementing a policy that the United States does not recognize Taiwan as part of China, and cheers for it. However, the United States recognizes China’s sovereignty over Hong Kong, but it has not placed Hong Kong under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Deputy Assistant Minister. Therefore, it may be challenged to refer this to the status of the United States toward Taiwan. Besides, the United States has never recognized that Taiwan is part of the People’s Republic of China. Therefore, it is not necessary to use this as a way to demonstrate that the United States does not recognize Beijing’s one-China principle. Rather than rigidly linking this group of defense reforms to Taiwan's status, we need to pay more attention to what is behind this, and what kind of strategic thinking is opposed to Taiwan.
Putting Taiwan in the strategic dilemma formed by the US-China platform and the Japan-China platform
Traditionally, Taiwan’s main thinking structure for dealing with the United States and Japan is based on the influence of China’s factors on these two bilateral relations, namely the so-called ""US-China-Taiwan"" to the United States and the ""Japan-China Railway"" to Japan. These two triangular architectures. Under this framework, Taiwan’s competition with China for the United States and its relations with Japan also means that the United States and Japan should be chosen on both sides.
However, because the United States and Japan have established formal diplomatic relations with China, and they have informal relations with Taiwan, and China’s influence is large, it is not a small island in Taiwan that can directly confront. Therefore, at the beginning of this trade-off, Taiwan will be placed in a very unfavorable position. Even if Taiwan-US relations or Taiwan-Japan relations are to be upgraded, there must be opportunities in the midst of Sino-US or Sino-Japanese relations.
If Taiwan-US relations and Taiwan-Japan relations are most likely to develop when Sino-US relations are not good, they are actually not correct. Because Japan and the United States are responsible for Taiwan affairs officials, they often deal with Chinese affairs. In the face of habitual thinking in the midst of Sino-US or Sino-Japanese relations, these officials are trying their best to get US-China or Japan-China relations back. Stable, not let the relationship continue to deteriorate. At this time, any proposal to develop relations with Taiwan will be considered to be a new variable for the US-China or Japan-China bilateral relations that are already in trouble, and will be rejected.
What is even more exaggerated is that when these bilateral relations stabilized, the proposal to promote relations with Taiwan will also be considered as a bilateral relationship that is not easy to stabilize and therefore vetoed. The conclusion is that regardless of whether the relationship between the United States, Japan and China is good, proposals to promote bilateral relations with Taiwan are often seen as troublemakers of China-China relations and are not adopted. There will be breakthroughs, often taking great resources beforehand and finding opportunities in very occasional situations.
This dilemma led to two claims in the Taiwan diplomatic community. The first one can be said that former Foreign Minister Qian Fu was the representative and believed that the key to Taiwan’s international space was in cross-strait relations. As long as the cross-strait relations are good, whether China is not suppressed or the other side is less worried about China’s retaliation, this will give Taiwan and the United States and Japan the opportunity to enhance bilateral relations. This idea was later promoted by Ma Ying-jeou, proposing that ""cross-strait relations are higher than diplomacy"" and ""cross-strait relations are superior relations."" This strategy has no benefit to Taiwan's international survival. Whether China is willing to accept Taiwan's international presence is therefore believed to be well known after Ma Ying's eight-year experiment.
Another proposition is to convince the target countries to cut their relations between China and Taiwan, and regard them as two parallel lines, emphasizing that Taiwan does not oppose the development of good relations between these countries and China, as long as these countries do not sacrifice their Relations with Taiwan. President Li’s claim to US relations at the time was basically the same.
However, in the second term of President Bill Clinton, who was scared by Chinese missiles, the US Security Society first proposed cross-strait signing of a ""medium-way agreement"", and in the United States it also proposed to participate in Taiwan’s international participation. Highly restricted ""three no policies."" At that time, the US Clinton administration was eager to reduce its commitment to Taiwan to avoid conflict with China, which made the relationship between Taiwan and the United States worsened. Even after the ""special state-state relations theory"" was put forward, the United States had scholars (then Bao Dao Ge). Directly cursing President Li as a troublemaker. In this case, President Li’s claim is difficult to sustain.
Obviously these two corresponding methods have fundamental problems. The former relies on China's willingness to accept Taiwan's international presence, and the latter expects the United States (or Japan) to distinguish between right and wrong. Regardless of whether the interpretation of the old Communist Party was wrong, or the international environment of the year was not allowed, the two external disputes that mainly existed in the diplomatic system did not have a victory at that time. Only twenty years later, the United States began to practice President Lee’s proposal to ""cut the relationship between China and Taiwan"" and blame the Ma’s pro-China line of appeasement.

The Taiwan-Japan relationship in which the DPP first came to power is a big unknown, but it also stimulates new thinking.
This elite debate over the Kuomintang's diplomatic strategy is related to the specific foreign relations management, and it feels quite far from the DPP, which has no ruling experience. When the DPP won the election for the first time in 2000, diplomatic relations were a blank piece of paper, and its diplomatic white paper was also full of strong idealism. Because there is no ruling experience, there is a lot of wishful understanding of the forces of globalization and supranationality. In addition to a little understanding and management of the relationship with the United States, it is almost blank for the Japanese side.
This situation made Japan very nervous at the time, so the relationship between Taiwan and Japan was full of uncertainty when the DPP took office. At that time, who could think of the most proud foreign relations of the DPP government after eight years, not the relationship with the United States, but the relationship between Taiwan and Japan. Just because the imagination of Japan is a blank piece of paper, the DPP has proposed new imaginations in a relatively unbounded situation. In addition to relying heavily on the two ambassadors of the Taiwan independence ally, the DPP’s operation on Japan’s relations has brought new space through the development of new strategic thinking.
The Democratic Party’s most transformative thinking about Japan’s relations at the time was to think about how to leverage its relationship with Japan to leverage its relations with Japan. However, the subsequent progress in the relationship between Taiwan and the United States and Taiwan has caused the DPP government to think in turn about how to use its relationship with Japan, which is still known to have good results, to help its relationship with the United States, which has fallen into a downturn. The so-called new triangle relationship between the US, Japan and Taiwan is first developed under the tactical level of the relationship between Taiwan and Japan and between Taiwan and the United States. Later, after internal reform, it will rise to the strategic level and become a new national security claim.
When analyzing the three triangular structures of Japan, China, Taiwan, the United States, China, and the United States and Japan, it is found that whether it is Japan, China, Taiwan, or the United States, China, Taiwan, Taiwan is in trouble to compete with China for Japan and the United States. . This is because of the Japan-China platform or the US-China platform, and there is a zero-sum structure in the development of the relationship between the two sides of the United States and Japan. That is to say, under this trilateral relationship, Taiwan’s gain is China’s loss, or China’s gain is Taiwan’s loss. However, the triangular relationship between the US, Japan, and Taiwan shows that the three relationships of Taiwan, the United States, Japan, and Japan are not negative. This allows Taiwan-US relations, Japan-US relations, and Taiwan-Japan relations to develop together positively.
In addition, Taiwan is a controversy over China-China relations with China, but it is an important strategic asset to Japan for Japan, and similar situations have occurred in Japan. Therefore, the introduction of the US-Japan-Taiwan triangle is to break the discussion on the policy of the United States and Japan's Tongzhi-matching platform in the discussion of the structure, and to develop a new perspective on Taiwan's strategic care. When you discuss Taiwan-related issues, you will no longer look at Taiwan from the perspective of cross-strait relations, or you will regard Taiwan as a variable in its bilateral relations with China.
Especially in the actual handling of relations with Japan, in the face of the policy inertia of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in order to stabilize Japan-China relations and suppress the relationship with Taiwan, the emergence of the US-Japan-Taiwan triangle will make Taiwan appear in the Japanese Foreign Ministry's strategic radar. In the past, Taiwan has the opportunity to develop relations with the Japanese foreign policy policy core - the relationship with the United States / Japan-US alliance operators. This will not only give Taiwan an opportunity to directly grasp the way of thinking in the core circle of Japanese diplomacy, but also have the opportunity to engage in dialogue with the top foreign policymakers of Japan. This was all that Taiwan’s dreams were not available at the time. Especially at the time of the US Bush administration, it was the Pan-Asian faction that attached importance to the US-Japan alliance over the Sino-Israeli relationship. The Japanese-American triangle equivalence theory of the Japanese policy circles subsided, which also allowed the construction of the US-Japan platform. The concept of tripartite cooperation has more room for success.
Originally, in order to break the Chinese perspective and find a new model for developing relations between Taiwan and the United States and Taiwan and Japan, it introduced the triangular relationship between the United States, Japan and Taiwan. This has since become the most important triangular relationship of Taiwan's security strategy. Afterwards, the United States Obama Administration’s ""Asia-Pacific/Asia-Pacific rebalancing"" strategy showed the development of the ""United States-Japan alliance plus one"". Japan and the United States also proposed their Indian-Taiwan strategic proposition. This makes the establishment of the US-Japan-Taiwan triangle no longer a unilateral expectation of Taiwan, but also echoes from people of insight from the United States and Japan.
Is the US-Japan-Taiwan cooperation a three-way bilateral cooperation or a bilateral cooperation between Taiwan and the US-Japan alliance?
This triangular relationship may be Taiwan's most important network of major power relations. Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the US-Taiwan Chamber of Commerce, said, ""It is more likely to become the power multiplier of the two sets of bilateral relations between Taiwan and the United States and Taiwan."" But when it comes to implementation, it will soon encounter a Key question: Is the US-Japan-Taiwan cooperation a cooperation between the three countries of Taiwan, the United States and Japan on certain issues, or is it the bilateral cooperation between Taiwan and the US-Japan alliance?
The former is relatively simple, because it is possible to directly select some less sensitive or controversial issues for collaborative interaction. However, I believe this is not the intention of Taiwan to launch the tripartite cooperation between the United States, Japan and Taiwan, and to introduce the original intention of the Taiwan-US-Japan triangular relationship to enter the strategic management of the Taiwan Strait. After all, it is interactive and interactive. In order to present the US-Japan-Taiwan triangle and lay a groundwork for tripartite cooperation, this triangle relationship will not last forever. However, if the latter can be initiated, the premise is that the United States and Japan are willing to engage in interaction and cooperation with Taiwan in an alliance manner, which has made Taiwan's powers limited.
In addition, if we want to develop bilateral interaction between Taiwan and the US-Japan alliance, it is necessary for Taiwan to take the initiative to propose its own ideas with the managers of the US-Japan alliance and remind the other party how to look at the relationship between Taiwan and the United States from the perspective of the US-Japan alliance.
There are three actions involved here. The first is the interaction between Taiwan and the US-Japan alliance managers, including the units that handle the US-Japan 2nd and 2nd meetings. Taipei is also required to establish a link between Taiwan and the US-Japan Security Consultative Committee and the Security Subcommittee.
The second and third are Taiwan’s communication with the United States on the handling of bilateral relations between Taiwan and the United States and the management of Japan’s bilateral relations with Taiwan. The latter two are based on the fact that the US-Japan alliance has become one of the factors in the management of Taiwan-US relations with Taiwan and Japan, so that the two bilateral relations between Taiwan and the United States and Taiwan and Japan will not be dominated by Chinese factors.
Strategically, this is also the intention to make the US-Japan alliance and Taiwan appear in the US-Japan-Taiwan relationship. But seventeen years ago there was no room to put this idea into practice. At that time, the most important concern of the US-Japan alliance was the North Korean issue. The alliance management was also based on the limitations of the Japanese Constitution. In response to the 1997 ""New Trends of the US-Japan Alliance"", the development of Taiwan was included in the ""peripheral situation"". The Japanese Parliament has become a topic of debate. The different teachings of Kato’s then chief of the Liberal Democratic Party and the then chief of the bureau were examples. When Taiwan is included in the scope of the US-Japan alliance and there is still debate within Japan, the time to launch the US-Japan alliance and Taiwan has not yet arrived.
If we look at the development of the United States to promote the integration of its Asia-Pacific alliance, the informal two-plus-two meeting of the United States, Japan and Australia was launched in 2003, but it was not until 2007 that the US-Japan-Australia tripartite meeting officially emerged, and the United States promoted its Asia-Pacific bilateral alliance. The first case of integration. After that, the Obama administration continued to promote the trilateral cooperation with the US-Japan alliance as the main axis in the Asia-Pacific region, including the US-Japan-Korea, the US-Japan-India.
Under this new initiative, bilateral security cooperation between Japan and Australia, as well as cooperation between Japan, Australia and India, have also made progress. What is important is that although these are trilateral cooperation in nature, it is obviously the ""US-Japan alliance plus one"" promoted by the US-Japan alliance. This development also shows that Taiwan is promoting the path of cooperation between the US, Japan and Taiwan. It may still be easier to meet the bilateral relationship between ""Taiwan and the US-Japan alliance.""
Interestingly, the United States promoted the internal cooperation of its Asia-Pacific alliance and expanded its bilateral alliance into three sides, even multilateral security cooperation, during the first period of the Obama administration (also just Hillary Clinton). Secretary of State, when Kurt Campbell served as Assistant Secretary of State for Asia and the Pacific, but Taiwan sang the era of the Ma government that ""cross-strait is higher than diplomacy."" At that time, Taiwan’s relations with Japan on the ""cross-strait cooperation and fishing"" doubts, and many times with the Japanese Coast Guard vessel to launch a water cannon battle. This runs counter to the trend of the United States to promote the integration of bilateral alliances and the multilateralization of bilateral security cooperation.
If the idea of promoting the cooperation between the United States and Japan in the era of the flat government is to introduce the US-Japan alliance to change the triangular structure of the US, China, Taiwan and Japan, which are relatively unfavorable to Taiwan, it seems that it is too early in timing. In the era of the Ma government, because of his pro-China anti-Japanese ideology, Taiwan has missed such an opportunity. It also promoted cross-strait military mutual trust and accommodating Taiwan’s retreat to openly and frequently travel to China, so that US-Taiwan mutual trust continues to bottom out and China is also allowed. I think it can put more pressure on Taiwan. In 2013, Xi Jinping publicly told Xiao Wanchang that the ""cross-strait political differences could not be passed down from generation to generation"" was intimidated and could not be related to this strategic background.
Although it seems premature for Taiwan to promote this initiative, under the initiative of the United States, Japan and other people with lofty ideals, this concept began to take root in the US policy circle of the United States and Japan’s circle of relations with the United States. As these two circles interacted with each other frequently, this idea gradually gained the mainstream recognition of the US-Japan policy circle. Including former Japanese ambassador to Thailand, Okazaki, and former US Deputy Secretary of State, Richard Armitage, and former National Security Council Asia Pacific Senior Director Michael Green, they all supported this idea. Ambassador Okazaki has repeatedly mentioned Taiwan’s strategic importance to Japan not only in Japan, but also actively promoted the cooperation between the US, Japan and Taiwan through the Okazaki Institute, which he chaired, and Taiwan’s think tanks and Japanese policy experts in the United States. Hold a seminar.
In the case of the US and Japan’s extreme rejection of this initiative, the meeting was like a preaching or briefing by the missionaries on the policy circles. Most of the ""preachings"" accepted were the young bureaucrats at the time or the policy-minded staff. However, after more than a decade, the Japanese and American policy environment changed. After these middle-level officials and the aides were also on the high post, this concept gradually appeared in practice.

Han Rubo suggested that Japan copy the US defense group reform to effectively develop Taiwan-Japan security cooperation
At the first time, the Obama administration promoted the integration of the US-Pacific bilateral alliance under the strategy of Pivot Toward Asia launched by Assistant Secretary of State for Asia Pacific Campbell. Although Campbell did not renew his official position at the second post of Obama, the second term of Obama was accompanied by a gradual adjustment of the Taiwan policy and the separation of US-Taiwan relations from the US-China relationship. This means that the US-Taiwan relationship is not necessarily the second relationship between the United States and China.
At that time, Washington also began to remind the Malaysian government that ""Taiwan does not make troublemakers in US-China relations."" The US-Taiwan relationship has its own logic and necessity that has nothing to do with China. It was only at that time that ""the two sides of the strait were higher than diplomacy"" and thought that the two sides of the strait would be able to get the US horse government and turn a blind eye to Washington's appeal. It was not until the Cai government came to power that Taiwan saw a positive response to this appeal.
After the Trump administration published the National Security Report, it completely reversed the US strategy for the past 40 years. Trump seriously confronted the essence of the US-China competition, and even launched competition in the fields of economy, science and technology, and decided to counterattack China's sharp international penetration. Under the framework of the Indo-Pacific strategy, the United States has to focus on China to start long-term competition, and the United States has viewed Taiwan in a different way. The US-Taiwan relationship should not only be viewed separately, but Taiwan is the most critical frontline for competition between the United States and China, and it will even be the key to the success of competition.
Under this framework, the United States is more willing to listen to Taiwan's suggestions/complaints about the development of bilateral relations. If we want Taiwan-US relations to get rid of the US-China relationship, we will be treated more favorably. In particular, it involves the official residence of the Washington government, because this is the United States can handle it.
Xue Ruifu removed Taiwan from the jurisdiction of the deputy assistant minister of China and the deputy assistant minister in charge of Northeast Asia. In operation, he could exempt the bureaucratic inertia from the problems caused by Taiwan-US relations. No matter which deputy assistant minister of Taiwan is under the jurisdiction of China, China will certainly complain about the relationship between China and the United States. The main task of the Deputy Assistant Secretary is to handle the US-China relations. Naturally, any request to enhance the relationship between Taiwan and the United States will be regarded as a trouble at the expense of US-China relations. If the relationship with Taiwan is under the jurisdiction of the deputy assistant minister, in order to prevent Taiwan from becoming a variable in US-China relations, it will be negative for the promotion of Taiwan-US relations.
However, if the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Northeast Asia views Taiwan-US relations, because it will help the US-Japan relations, it will not be a negative factor for other regional alliances or partners in the United States. Therefore, the proposal to promote cooperation between Taiwan and the United States will be more positive. This is due to changes in attitudes brought about by the subordination of different organizations. For Taiwan-US relations operations that lack a solid system, the impact is far more profound than that of other United States-owned and large-scale alliances.
It is precisely because of the possible influence of the mechanism that Han Rubo, president of the US-Taiwan Chamber of Commerce, made a public proposal at a US-Japan meeting hosted by the ""2049 Project"". Japan can refer to Xue Ruifu’s attempt and also launch internal relations with Taiwan. China’s bureaucratic management mechanism has changed to face up to China’s influence and effectively promote relations with Taiwan.
Since Xue Ruifu was a member of the US policy circle against Japan at the time, he was also familiar with Ambassador Okazaki, and the Okazaki Institute, and his group’s reforms to the Pentagon were related to the handling of Taiwan’s policy in the previous Taiwan-US-Japan meeting. The direction is quite consistent. It is only the direct talk of the US, Japan and Taiwan in the past, but now it is gradually implemented through the India-Pacific strategy.

Taiwan is the country that most of these parties need to carry out strategic introspection.
Compared with 19 years ago, Taiwan’s strategic circle now speaks of the price of the US, Japan and Taiwan, but Taiwan itself is the country that most needs strategic introspection for the three-party cooperation between the United States, Japan and Taiwan.
First of all, if there is a commitment to promoting the strategic concept of the US, Japan, and Taiwan, and it is unwilling to let Taiwan return to the track of competing with China for US-Japan relations, the analysis of the relationship between the United States and Japan cannot be held in the US-China platform. With the structure of the Japanese-Chinese platform. In the triangular relationship between the US, Japan and Taiwan, China is only regarded as a factor that will affect the relationship between Taiwan and Japan and Taiwan and the United States; and the US-China, Taiwan-China-Taiwan-Taiwan relationship that regards China as part of the Taiwan-US and Taiwan-Japan interactive structure is very different.
Secondly, in the relationship between the United States and Japan, how to consciously use Japan and the United States to enhance relations with the United States and Japan is the key to how the Taiwan-US-Japan-Japan triangular relationship can be embodied in tripartite cooperation. During the first term, the DPP government made some progress in using relations with the United States to promote relations with Japan, but it did not have any effect in using relations with Japan to assist relations with the United States.
There are many factors that have such development. However, at that time, Taiwan handled relations with the United States and Japan, and it belonged to two different teams in the diplomatic system. Because of various historical and organizational reasons (such as Japan's Asia-Pacific Division, the United States is the North American Division), they rarely communicate with each other. In addition, the diplomatic elite dealing with the relationship with the United States is hesitant about the role that Taiwan-Japan relations can play in the affairs of the United States. It is also due to the inertia of daily business, which makes it lack of attention to the US policy toward Japan. The progress of the Japan Alliance is not well understood, and its US business is still viewed from the perspective of the US-China-Taiwan triangular structure. These have created obstacles to Taiwan's integration of its management of US-Japan relations. As a result, in the latter part of the Bian government, the relationship with the United States has become very bad and mutual trust is insufficient. Even if Prime Minister Abe of Japan was willing to help, the overall situation became difficult to deal with.
If we want to avoid the recurrence of the problem of the year, Taiwan must not only consciously integrate the management of relations with Japan and the United States, carefully study the trajectory of the US-Japan and Japan's policy toward the United States, and climb the key to its policy contacts. Taiwan should actively introduce the US-Japan alliance on the discussion of the Taiwan Strait issue, making it an important factor in the US, Japan and other international talks about the Taiwan-Taiwan peacekeeping policy, while actively seeking cooperation with the US-Japan alliance development mechanism. More importantly, Taiwan must thoroughly eradicate the policy inertia of ""cross-strait higher than diplomacy"" among the officials of the national security diplomacy, including intentionally reducing the frequency of interaction with Japan and delaying the development of the US-Japan alliance in order to worry about China's reaction. Cooperation ideas, etc.
Finally, can we consider using Xue Ruifu’s opportunity to reform the Ministry of National Defense, so that Taiwan’s diplomacy and national security and intelligence systems will undergo similar changes, help Taiwan to more effectively handle relations with the United States and Japan, and develop cooperation between Taiwan, the United States and Japan?
