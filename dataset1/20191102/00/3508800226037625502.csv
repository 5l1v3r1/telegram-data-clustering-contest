02 Nov 2019, 00:44 by False FOLLAW


What we want you to know is that in the movie ""The Clown"", what is the legal responsibility of the clown's crime? What is the criminal responsibility of a mentally handicapped person when committing a crime?



The clown is commonly known as the ugly man in the American comic culture circle. It is a classic villain of the DC comics, a famous criminal in Gotham City, and the dead rival of Batman. The genius mind and crazy thinking are its own characteristics. Crime is not for power and wealth is only fun. . With the development of DC dramas, the clown appeared in a number of different actors. Before this year (2019), the best known version was the clown played by the late actor Heath Ledger in the Dark Knight, but this year Wauke Phoenix's version in the movie ""The Clown"" has surprised more people. In the past, we have seen the mature clowns with wings and wings, and the ""Clown"" movie can be said to be the mental journey before the rise of the clown.
The clown played by Vaughan Finn, named Arthur Fleck, is a person with a disability who lives in the bottom of Gotham City. He lives as a clown and is determined to be a comedian, but he is often discriminated against because of his mental disorder. And bullying. Arthur’s situation was originally an uncontrollable laugh. It was harmless to others, but on the way back to the subway, he was attacked by three drunkards. Arthur shot and killed three people in self-defense, plus the government cut the budget. Arthur couldn't get a spiritual treatment, and his personality became more and more distorted.

(The following begins with film content, lightning warning)
justifiable defense
Arthur was attacked by drunkards while taking the subway. Arthur shot and killed three people in self-defense. According to Article 23 of the Criminal Law of our country, there is no penalty for the violation of the current lawlessness and the act of defending the rights of oneself or others. However, those who have defended their behavior may be relieved or exempted from their punishment. Arthur shot and killed three people in the face of three beatings. The two men who were shot because they were out of self-defense meant that they could defend their legitimate defense. But because another person has escaped, Arthur continues to pursue, and can not claim legitimate defense.
What is the crime of killing a foster parent?
After Arthur’s mother told Arthur’s life story, Arthur went to verify, and found himself to be adopted, and his mother suffered from paranoia, and in the early years of Arthur’s childhood, he let his boyfriend abuse Arthur, causing Ya Se's head was damaged, causing him to laugh unconsciously now. After knowing the truth, Arthur used his pillow to suffocate his mother in the hospital bed, and thus turned away from the rationality of ordinary people.
Article 272 of the Criminal Law of China, for those who are directly guilty of the relatives of the blood relatives, aggravated their punishment to one-half. Since the criminal law does not limit the natural blood relatives, it also includes the adoption of artificial blood relatives such as adoption. Therefore, the killing of the adoptive parents constitutes the crime of killing the immediate relatives in China.

Criminal responsibility for mental disorders
Murray, the comedy host of Arthur Worship, publicly broadcasts Arthur’s out-of-control film during the club’s performance as a joke, and invites Arthur to be a guest on the show, but Arthur sees that the purpose is to make fun of himself as a show Arthur dressed up as a clown and was invited to the show as a clown. Not only did he publicly admit that he shot and killed the employees of Wein, but also began to think that killing was a funny thing, and pointed out that the host’s malicious pastime was Even after saying ""what happens when people living at the bottom of society are treated as garbage"", the gun shot and killed host Murray, and it is known that Arthur has completely lost control, and Arthur was arrested by the police. .
If it is in our country, Article 271 of the Criminal Law: ""The murderer, the death sentence, life imprisonment or a term of imprisonment of more than ten years. The attempt of the preceding paragraph is punishable. Those who are prepared to commit the first offence are sentenced to two years in prison."" Killing on the show should constitute murder. However, in accordance with Article 19: ""Because of mental disorder or other mental deficiencies in behavior, it is not punished for the ability to behave illegally or lack the ability to act according to its identification. The act is illegal because of the reasons of the preceding paragraph. The ability to act according to their identification, significantly reduced, has to reduce their punishment."" Arthur's mental disorder may constitute a refusal to blame and blame.
The aptitude of the disabled
After Arthur was arrested, he was sent to a mental hospital for treatment. If the treatment of people with mental disorders in China is treated in principle according to the Mental Health Law. The local government may apply for subsidies from the central government in accordance with Article 17 if it is financially inadequate in handling relevant business. In addition, Article 32 stipulates that when a police officer or fire-fighting machine discovers that a patient or a person who has the status specified in the first paragraph of Article 3 has harmed others or is harmed by himself or herself, he shall notify the local competent authority and It is required to request assistance or joint processing; unless otherwise stipulated by law, it should be escorted to the nearest appropriate medical institution for medical treatment, or to the local police and fire-fighting agencies. In severe cases, persons with mental disorders who are harming themselves or others may be hospitalized for medical treatment in accordance with Articles 41 and 45 to protect the safety of the disabled and others.
The film can be divided into two levels, one is the individual level, and the innate and acquired factors will affect the individual's mental health. The other is the social level. The society is seriously rich and poor. The social weakness is lacking in medical resources. There is a lack of respect and care between people and people. The disadvantage is often discriminated against. Arthur's mental disorder, due to social injustice, continued to deteriorate, and the last one was out of control. And Gotham’s bottom of society, because Arthur shot the white-collar class, and publicly executed on the show to make fun of the weak, and then the clown as a heroic hero, rioted on the streets. It shows that people are part of society, and society is made up of individuals. The two are inseparable. The injustice of the society has a negative impact on people's mental health and can also cause social unrest, which is fully revealed in this film.
