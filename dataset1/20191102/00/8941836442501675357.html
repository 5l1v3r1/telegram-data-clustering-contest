      <p>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Rhode Island has launched a new program to make more electric vehicle charging stations accessible to drivers.</p>
      <p>The Rhode Island Office of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/world-energy-resources/">Energy Resources</a> says it launched “Electrify RI” as an electric vehicle charging station incentive program.</p>
      <p>The $1.4 million program will help fund the installation of new charging stations at Rhode Island workplaces, multi-unit dwellings and state, quasi-public and local government properties. The money is coming from a government settlement with Volkswagen, which modified vehicles to cheat on emissions tests.</p>
      <p>State Energy Commissioner Carol Grant says she wants to make it easier for people to install charging stations and “inspire drivers to go green,” to reduce transportation-related carbon emissions and pollutants.</p>
