SAUGUS, Mass. - A 57-year-old Melrose woman crashed her car into Giovanni's Roast Beef & Pizza early Saturday morning.
Saugus Police and Fire responded to the pizza shop at 194 Broadway just before 7:30 a.m. First responders found a 2016 Mercedes Benz E350 that crashed roughly three-quarters of the way into the front of the building.
Rescuers located the driver and evaluated her at the scene. No one was inside the building at the time since it was closed.
The shop isn't allowed to reopen until any structural damage is assessed.
Police are investigating the crash. An initial on-scene investigation indicated that the driver did not appear to be impaired and that human error or mechanical failure are the two most likely causes of the crash.
