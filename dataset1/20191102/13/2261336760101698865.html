      <h1>How to watch Canelo Alvarez vs. Sergey Kovalev live stream online</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T13:30:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author">Bloody Elbow</a></address>
      <p>WBC “franchise” and WBA middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2, 35 KOs) is stepping up two weight classes for a big showdown with WBO light heavyweight champion Sergey Kovalev (34-3-1, 29 KOs) in front of a very pro-Canelo crowd at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
      <p>Alvarez is coming off a decision win over Daniel Jacobs in a unification bout, but he has since been stripped of the IBF title that he won from Jacobs for not fighting mandatory challenger Sergiy Derevyanchenko. The Mexican superstar instead opted to challenge himself at a weight class he’s never fought at before.</p>
      <aside><b><a href="https://bit.ly/2VHPAdj">WATCH CANELO VS.

      <p>Kovalev lost his WBO title to Eleider Alvarez in a shocking KO loss last year, but won the belt back in their immediate rematch in February. Against Anthony Yarde, the Russian rallied from nearly getting stopped in the 8th round by knocking Yarde out in the 11th frame, much to the delight of his fellow Russians in attendance. This is a fairly quick turnaround given the Yarde bout was August 24th, but Kovalev gets a career payday and a big money fight.</p>
