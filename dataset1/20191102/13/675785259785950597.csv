Granit Xhaka has used his captain's notes in Arsenal's matchday programme for Saturday's clash with Wolves to double down on the statement he made in midweek.
The Gunners skipper spoke out on social media following the reaction to his substitution against Crystal Palace last weekend, when he was roundly booed by home supporters.
Fans were divided on Xhaka's statement, in which he claimed that threats had been made to his wife and daughter following the incident.
Some claim that Xhaka's words don't offer enough of an apology for his reaction to the substitution, when he was seen mouthing ""f*** off"" towards the fans.

The Swiss is not in the squad for Saturday's clash with Wolves, and also missed the midweek Carabao Cup tie defeat at Liverpool .
There have been calls for Gunners boss Unai Emery to strip Xhaka of the captaincy, with the midfielder having taken up the role earlier this season following a vote among the players.
In his captain's column Xhaka simply wrote: ""In these notes, I hope you will respect that I just wish to repeat the message which I posted on Instagram on Thursday.""

The statement - which was tweeted by Arsenal's official Twitter account - is then repeated word for word underneath.
West Ham captain Mark Noble has vioiced his support for Xhaka, but claimed that he should probably now seek a move away from the Gunners.
""Granit is one of those players who wears his heart on his sleeve and it’s tough for him at the moment,"" he told the Evening Standard .

""In all honesty, the best solution might be to tell his agent, 'Look, they don’t like me here, so maybe it’s best if I go and play somewhere else'.
""I remember Slaven Bilic telling me, 'Once the box is open, it never closes'.
""The chances are that, if he makes one bad pass in the next match in which he plays, they’ll be on him again.""
