        <i>Handré Pollard’s kicks make him the man of the match while his opposite number George Ford has an unhappy 50 minutes</i>
      </p>
      <h3>England</h3>
      <p><b>Elliot Daly </b>A difficult day when he was craning his neck as the aerial bombardment rained down but a tidy display. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Anthony Watson</b> The Bath wing looked a danger on the odd occasion he escaped South Africa’s shackles and has improved match by match. <b>5</b></p>
      <p><b>Manu Tuilagi</b> The match-winner against the All Blacks made a couple of muscular breaks but was mainly confined to defensive duties. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Owen Farrell </b>His four penalties kept England in it until the sky fell in. He tackled tirelessly but unable to exert his usual authority. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Jonny May </b>The good news was he kept Cheslin Kolbe under wraps. The bad news was he never had a sight of the tryline himself. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>George Ford</b> Ford has been one of England’s best players in Japan but it was an unhappy ending. Was harried mercilessly by Bok back row. <b>5</b></p>
      <p><b>Ben Youngs </b>The scrum-half was unable to make any sniping runs but kicked well in the face of the ever‑present Bok back row. <b>5</b></p>
      <p><b>Mako Vunipola </b>He made some strong carries in the first half but had a less than comfortable 45 minutes in the scrums. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Jamie George</b> A couple of throws at the lineouts went astray but he was strong in the loose on a difficult day for England’s front row. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Kyle Sinckler</b> The prop’s third-minute collision with Itoje and Mapimpi knocked him cold. He and England could not recover. <b>n/a</b></p>
      <p><b>Maro Itoje</b> Could never emulate his stellar display against the All Blacks. A good display in the set piece in trying circumstances. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Courtney Lawes</b> The lock made some telling breaks when England battered away at the Boks’ tryline just before the break. <b>5</b></p>
      <p><b>Tom Curry </b>Another mature display that belied his years with a huge hit on Pollard that led to a penalty. Worked tirelessly. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Sam Underhill</b> Before being replaced by Mark Wilson he made a number of thumping tackles and looked strong in rare forays with ball. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Billy Vunipola</b> The blood pouring from a patched-up head wound was symbolic of heroic effort in lost cause from side’s best forward. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Replacements: Dan Cole</b> (for Sinckler, 3) Hard and long shift <b>5</b>, <b>George Kruis</b> (for Lawes, ht) Steadied lineout <b>6</b>, <b>Joe Marler</b> (for M Vunipola, 45) Strong in scrum <b>6</b>, <b>Henry Slade</b> (for Ford, 49) Decent contribution <b>6</b>, <b>Luke Cowan-Dickie</b> (for George, 59) <b>6</b>, <b>Mark Wilson</b> (for Underhill, 59) <b>6</b>, <b>Jonathan Joseph</b> (for May, 70) <b>n/a</b></p>
      <h3>South Africa</h3>
      <p><b>Willie le Roux </b>The full-back was very safe under any high balls that England could rain down on him. His old head cool under pressure. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Cheslin Kolbe</b> The little wing hardly had a sniff of the ball. When he did showed a Jason Robinson‑esque ability to find space from nowhere. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Lukhanyo Am</b> He looked very sharp and played a big part in the Mapimpi try. Like his centre partner was very strong in defence. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Damian de Allende </b>Wales’s nemesis made a couple of powerful runs but was generally confined to a part in a stifling defensive effort. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Makazole Mapimpi </b>However dubious the first try was, South Africa’s top try‑scorer in Japan took it superbly. Always a danger. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Handré Pollard</b> Recovered from missing a second-minute penalty to convert 22 points, points that put the Boks beyond reach. <b>8</b></p>
      <p><b>Faf de Klerk </b>Was his usual effervescent self behind a dominant scrum and kicked well into places England did not want the ball to go. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Tendai Mtawarira </b>The Beast was a real menace in the scrum, giving replacement Dan Cole a rocky ride. Very strong all-round display. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Mbongeni Mbonambi</b> The hooker lasted only 20 minutes before he was injured in a tackle by Courtney Lawes and replaced by Malcolm Marx. <b>n/a</b></p>
      <p><b>Frans Malherbe</b> The tighthead was part of a front row that for the first half helped squeeze the life out of the England pack. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Eben Etzebeth</b> For an hour was a real handful for the English pack despite having treatment for a shoulder injury. Back to his best. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Lood de Jager</b> The Bulls lock left the field at the start of the second quarter in great pain from a shoulder injury but the Springboks coped. <b>5</b></p>
      <p><b>Siya Kolisi (capt) </b>François Pienaar was there to see another captain in a No 6 shirt lift the Webb Ellis Cup. Led the team superbly for 64 minutes. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Pieter-Steph du Toit</b> The converted lock followed his exceptional game against Wales with another brutal display, not giving Ford room to breathe. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Duane Vermeulen</b> Like the two Bok locks, the No 8 had treatment for a shoulder injury in a ferocious first half and made some big carries. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Replacements: Malcolm Marx</b> (for Mbonambi, 21) Big impact <b>7</b>, <b>Franco Mostert</b> (for De Jager, 21) Shored up scrum <b>7</b>, <b>Steven Kitshoff </b>(for Mtawarira , 44) Strong in the scrum <b>7</b>, <b>Vincent Koch</b> (for Malherbe, 44) Powerful <b>7</b>, <b>François Louw</b> (for Kolisi, 64) Big tackles <b>6</b>, <b>François Steyn</b> (for Le Roux, 67) <b>6</b>, <b>Herschel Jantjies</b> (for De Klerk, 77) <b>n/a</b></p>
