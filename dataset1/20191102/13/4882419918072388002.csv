 El central se mostró misterioso sobre su posible regreso con La Roja para ir a los Juegos Olímpicos en el micrófono de El Larguero (SER) | El Larguero

Gerard Pique suggested in an interview with Cadena Ser this week that he would be open to playing for Spain at the Olympic Games next summer.
However, sources inside the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) have told SPORT they took the Barcelona defender's ""missive"" as more of a joke than anything else.
Pique does have a good relationship with RFEF president Luis Rubiales but that is unlikely to be enough to see him called up for the Olympics in Japan next summer, keeping in mind he's retired from international football.
But Real Madrid's Sergio Ramos could go, occupying one of the three places in the squad reserved for players over the age of 23.
