Actress Jhanvi Kapoor Helps A Street Kid By Giving Biscuits And Money


Janhvi Kapoor is one of the most trending celebrities on social media and also one of the most sought after actresses in Bollywood. The young gun is lapped up with projects and her popularity does not seem to die down, courtesy of her genuine and humble ways.
Janhvi was recently spotted outside a venue in Mumbai, where she was approached by a street kid for some help. Janhvi, who was also surrounded by paparazzi, offered the small child with some customary sweets on Diwali.
However, as she proceeded to enter the venue, she invited the small, underprivileged child at the entryway and offered some financial assistance as well. The moment was captured on camera and is now doing rounds on social media, attracting love, praise and appreciation for her.



Janhvi helped the young child before going her separate way. This is not the first time that Jahnvi has extended a hand to an underprivileged person and has gone out of her way to help someone. Several such videos of the actress from the past have previously won over netizens and this time was no different.
“Nice to see you sharing with the less fortunate,” wrote a user on Instagram.
“This girl is soooo kind!!,” wrote another.
“So sweet of you jhanvi……it’s worth it….keep going,” another admirer of the actress said.
“Such a sweet heart.more celebs should learn from her,” posted one more user.
Janhvi, who often makes headlines for her amazing fashion sense and strict gym routine, made her big-screen debut opposite Ishaan Khatter with Shashank Khaitan’s Dhadak. The film, produced by Dharma Productions and Zee Studios, released in July last year. An official remake of the blockbuster Marathi film Sairat, it was a massive hit at the box office and went on to collect nearly Rs 75 crore in its lifetime.
Janhvi’s upcoming releases include Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl and RoohiAfza, both of which are slated to hit the screens in March and April next year, respectively. She also has Dostana 2, Takht and Bombay Girl in her kitty, the release dates of which are yet to be announced.
