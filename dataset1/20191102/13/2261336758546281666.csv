Video: Chinese MMA fighter KOs two kung fu ‘masters’ in 72 seconds

Last week we reported that an MMA fighter named A Hu knocked out wing chun ‘master’ Ding Hao at a style-vs-style fighting event in China. Apparently this isn’t the first time Hu has done this. It wasn’t even the first time he’d done it that night.
According to Asia One, Hu fought two self-proclaimed kung fu masters that night; Ding Hao and Song De Cai.
For the bout, Song was listed as 5’8”, 176 lbs and 44 years of age. Hu is twenty years younger, a little taller, and weighs 144 lbs. Asia One claims Song is a tai chi practitioner. Whatever Song is trained in it didn’t help him versus Hu, though.
Check out the video of the bout below, provided by Fight Commentary Breakdowns:



Despite being in his forties Song looked pretty spry to start the match, flying at Hu with a kick attempt. However, Song missed and landed on his rear-end. After that Hu landed a leg kick, defended against some wild punches, and then boxed his opponent into a corner.
In the corner Hu landed half a dozen punches, which resulted in Song hitting the canvas. The referee then mercifully called an end to the action.
After that fight Hu destroyed Ding Hao with a head kick KO. The total time of both fights came in at around 72 seconds. Here’s the demolition of Ding (also provided by Fight Commentary Breakdowns):



This wasn’t the first kind of these fights for Ding, either. Last year he was beaten up by Xu Xiaodong; the man who started this recent craze of MMA vs. kung fu.
Xu has been battling tai chi and wing chun stylists since 2017, when a social media argument escalated into a behind-closed-doors fight between Xu and a tai chi master named Wei Lei.
Since then Xu has become a controversial figure in China, railing against the ‘fakery’ of kung fu and challenging various masters to fights. As a result Xu has had his social media accounts taken down on numerous occasions, been successfully sued at the behest of the Chinese Wushu Association, and had his social credit rating demoted to a level that prevents him owning or renting property and traveling on high speed transit.
Despite the adversities he has faced, Xu continues to call out who he views as charlatans (as well as speak up for protestors in Hong Kong). Xu’s next fight is expected to happen sometime in December.
