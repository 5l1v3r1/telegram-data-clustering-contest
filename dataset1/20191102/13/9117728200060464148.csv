Magnussen realistic for team's home race: ""We're probably just outside top 10""
02 Nov 2019, 13:28 by Nicolás Quarles van Ufford

Ahead of his team's home race this Sunday, Haas driver Kevin Magnussen realistically thinks the American side will be just outside of the top 10 at COTA, with the Dane having scored points just once since the German Grand Prix.

Haas have had a very frustrating season on the back of their best-ever campaign in 2018, with the team only bagging 28 points in the first 18 rounds of the 2019 season.
They're in ninth place, which would be the worst finish in the team's brief history as they even finished eighth in the constructors' championship in their debut season in 2018.
Ahead of the United States Grand Prix, the team's home race on the calendar, Magnussen is hopeful for a good result but remains realistic.




""We’re not concerned about the times, we saw how FP1 went, we didn’t go low fuel and stuff like that,"" the Dane analysed as he finished FP1 and FP2 in 10th and 13th respectively. 

""That’s more representative of our pace, we’re probably just outside the top ten. It would be nice to find more, and actually be in the top ten, it’s very tight so we’ll just have to try and nail it tomorrow.”

Teammate Romain Grosjean struggled more on Friday, with the Frenchman crashing his car in FP2 and breaking both his front wing as well as his suspension.
