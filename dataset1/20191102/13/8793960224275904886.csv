Jakarta - Gubernur DKI Jakarta Anies Baswedan tidak hadir di acara Festival Djadoel di Kramat Jati, Jakarta Timur. Ketua Pelaksana Festival Djadoel Iwan Setiawan memahami Anies tak bisa datang lantaran kesibukannya sebagai gubernur.
""Ya usaha mengundang mah sudah, wajar kami ngundang. Nggak direspons ya nggak apa-apa. Kami maklumi saja dia (Anies) sibuk. Kami nggak ada pemikiran jelek ke beliau,"" kata Iwan di Lapangan Bola Bulak Rantai, Condet, Kramat Jati, Jakarta Timur, Sabtu (2/11/2019).
Iwan mengungkapkan panitia telah melayangkan undangan kepada Anies. ""Sudah ngundang, disposisi ke kepala dinas. Kepala dinas kan mengundurkan diri. Wali Kota juga kami undang. Kalau Wali Kota kan perhatian, dia tidak mewakili gubernur, tapi dia memang perhatian ke Festival Djadoel,"" ujar dia.
Alasan Anies tidak hadir? ""Sibuk. Kami doain, kasihan dia, dia orang baik kena batunya ke anak buahnya,"" jawab Iwan.
