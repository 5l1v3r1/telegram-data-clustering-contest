      <h2>Keep rollin'</h2>

      <p>I remember the day I was introduced to <i>Super Monkey Ball</i> on GameCube. It kind of came out of nowhere: someone shoved it in front of me and said "let's play." Eight hours later we were completely entranced, and most importantly, smiling. That's the sort of infectious happiness <i>Monkey Ball</i> is capable of, which is exactly why this underdog of a series was active for over a decade before slowing down.</p>
      <p>Sega is looking to get that ball rolling again with <i>Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz HD</i>. It's a shame that this re-release wasn't able to put its best foot forward with the ideal source material, but <i>Monkey Ball</i> remains as charming as ever.</p>

      <p>I'm happy to see <i>Monkey Ball</i> back in any form, and hope Sega keeps this series alive. The gist: <i>Marble Madness</i> meets monkeys, with more speed. How can anyone not love that premise?</p>
      <p>It's beauty through simplicity. You roll around pre-build courses avoiding hazards, trying not to roll off the course, collecting bananas and reaching a goal line. A life system and banana points dictate how well you're doing, with an equal emphasis on speed and pickup accuracy. Every so often you'll face down a boss (a few of which are mere formalities) and bonk a weak point.</p>
      <p>The formula, much like the "HD" bit of the moniker, hasn't been too touched-up. I went back and looked at the GameCube edition for comparison, and while you can easily tell the difference between the original release and the modern day version (mostly color saturation), a lot of the same issues bleed through, like halfhearted cutscenes and a lack of detail in the framing of the campaign and the UI. Simple gameplay is one thing, simplicity everywhere else can be draining.</p>

      <p>The main focus here is the 100-level campaign, which is <b>all solo</b> and connected with the aforementioned tenuous (well, it doesn't really exist) story. In case you didn't get the idea yet the courses are set up a lot like mini golf, you just have full control over how the ball moves (with analog sticks this time, no motion controls, for better or worse), and instead of a windmill there might be dastardly giant prehistoric birds blocking your path.</p>
      <p>The campaign is fun enough and keeps things moving at a rapid pace, but I would have liked to have seen full co-op added here, even pass and play. The root of the problem? <i>Banana Blitz</i> simply isn’t the best iteration of the series for a grand re-entrance. <i>Super Monkey Ball Deluxe</i> would have been a far better choice for an HD re-release, sporting more base levels, 240 challenge stages with full multiplayer support, plus more party games.</p>
      <p>Sega really stuck to their guns here as this is not a full remake with new modes, but rather an HD-re-release of the Wii game, as advertised. The only real multiplayer component is found within the party mode, which has 10 games, with nine of them supporting simultaneous four-player play. Sadly this setup strikes out again with a lack of bots, and there's no online multiplayer: only same-Switch and local support. You can play solo in time attack or party mode for high scores (and the new Decathlon mode that features all 10 party games in a row), but again, without bots.</p>
      <p>As a return effort the core of <i>Super Monkey Ball</i> is there with <i>Banana Blitz HD</i>, it’ll just be hard to turn people onto it unless you’re going in with a solo mindset. If you haven't ever experienced monkeys in balls before and plan on coming in as a rogue agent, that budget pricing helps.</p>
