      <p>TUI have moved to throw a couple off a cruise after just 24 hours - because they were "having sex too loudly".</p>
      <p>The couple, from Germany, were heading onto the cruise for a two-week trip around the Caribbean.</p>
      <p>But they left cruise workers stunned with their raunchy exploits - and were subsequently marched off board.</p>
      <p>The pair disembarked in Barbados, in the Caribbean, after their exploits drew raised eyebrows from baffled, red-faced members of staff.</p>
      <p>They were having intercourse with a balcony door open, according to reports.</p>

      <p>The duo, according to the  <a href="https://www.reisereporter.de/artikel/9921-tui-cruises-kreuzfahrt-mein-schiff-5-beendet-wegen-sex-paar-fliegt-von-kreuzfahrtschiff">Reise Reporter</a> , have now started legal proceedings against TUI cruises.</p>
      <p>The company is set to face a legal challenge from the pair, who hail from Europe.</p>
      <p>The German couple claim they were left "stranded" in Barbados with their suitcases, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/couple-kicked-tui-cruise-having-20794405">reports the Mirror</a> .</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Renate F, and her husband, Volker, told Reise they were having very loud "consensual sex" but forgot that their balcony door was open.</p>
      <p>The couple are now thought to be suing the holiday company for damages, including compensation for "pain" and reimbursement for travel expenses.</p>
      <p>They claim the tour operator and the captain "violated their duty of care".</p>
      <p>In a statement to the Resie Reporter, TUI said: "Due to a security related incident, we have made use of our house right and asked the guests to leave the ship.</p>
      <p>"This was done to protect the guests themselves and other fellow travellers.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"There has already been correspondence with Mrs F. in which we have set our our view of things.</p>
      <p>"Please understand that we do not want to comment on the privacy of our guests in detail."</p>
