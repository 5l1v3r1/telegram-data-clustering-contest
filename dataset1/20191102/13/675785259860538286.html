      <h1>McDonald’s ditches posh Signature Collection range after 'poor sales'</h1>
      <h2>The fast-food chain's Signature Collection, which feature more expensive burgers, is no longer on the menu</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T13:25:36+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 13:25</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Truelove</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mcdonalds-corporation">McDonald's</a> has scrapped its range of posh burgers because of "poor sales".</p>
      <p>Customers can no longer purchase the fast-food chain's Signature Collection after they were removed from the menu.</p>
      <p>The premium burgers featured a thicker beef patty made from 100% British and Irish beef and was available in three flavours - The Classic, The BBQ and The Spicy each served in a brioche-style bun.</p>
      <p>They were trialled in a number of restaurants before being relayed out across the UK in 2015.</p>
      <p>They were developed with the help of chefs who had put their cooking skills to the test in Michelin-starred restaurants.</p>
      <p>The three different flavours came at a higher price - £4.69 for an individual burger and £6.19 for a meal - and featured "higher quality ingredients" and served in a brioche-style bun.</p>
      <p>In comparison, a Big Mac costs £3.19 while a plain hamburger is just 89p.</p>

      <p>When the Signature Collection was launched McDonald's hoped it would give customers the chance to upgrade their burgers to something a bit more 'premium'.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/10261698/mcdonalds-scrap-signature-collection/">The Sun</a> , the decision to scrap the collection was taken in August due to "poor sales".</p>
      <p>Although customers can no longer buy Signature Collection burgers, McDonald's has not ruled out bringing the collection back sometime in the future.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for McDonald’s said: “We are sorry to disappoint fans of the range, which launched in the UK in 2015, and might return in the future as part of a limited time food promotion.”</p>

      <p>McDonald's has been in the mood of scrapping items off its menu of late.</p>
      <p>The fast food giant scrapped its Dairy Milk and Crunchie McFlurries but tried to console ice-cream fans by replacing them and making Smarties and Malteasers permanent fixtures instead.</p>
      <p>But it's not been all bad news for McDonald's fans.</p>
      <p>They gave its Bacon Roll a major upgrade with a new and improved recipe, added a new Chicken Salad and a wrap - The Hot Cajun Chicken One.</p>
