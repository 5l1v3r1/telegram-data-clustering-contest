I am apologetic that I offended my broadcast viewers and YouTube subscribers.""She continued, ""Regarding the controversy about my stream, I'm currently in the situation where I want to let you know my stance once I have the evidence for you to judge whether my words are true or false. Otherwise, if I were to hastily tell my point of view, it could easily become exaggerated in the media and cause misunderstanding. Once again, I bow my head in apology for causing concern.""As previously reported, a netizen alleged in an internet community forum post that he'd spent 1 billion Won ($856,539 USD) on a female BJ (broadcast jockey) and former idol star because he believed they were in a romantic relationship.

The netizen further claimed he wrote the post to warn other possible victims and was thinking of taking legal action against her.Stay tuned for updates.
