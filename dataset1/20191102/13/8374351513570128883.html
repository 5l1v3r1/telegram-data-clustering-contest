      <h1>Clean Fuel starts price rollbacks – P0.25/liter for diesel; P0.10/liter for gasoline</h1>

      <p>Consumers will be enjoying another round of token petroleum price rollbacks at the scale of P0.25 per liter for diesel; and P0.10 per liter for gasoline products.</p>
      <p>This batch of price cuts had been initiated by Clean Fuel, one of the deregulated downstream oil sector’s independent players. Its price adjustments will be effective 4:01pm on Sunday (November 3); while the rest of the industry players are anticipated to follow.</p>
      <p>As initially assessed on the outcome of four-day trading in the world market, gasoline prices will likely be rolled back by P0.25 to P0.35 per liter; and diesel by P0.10 to P0.20 per liter.</p>
      <p>Most of the oil companies, being their usual course, will be adjusting prices by Tuesday (November 5) – and may enforce price cuts disparate from what has been implemented by Clean Fuel.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) which is the cooking fuel commodity for households, will be higher for this month of November.</p>
      <p>Leading oil firm Petron Corporation announced LPG price increase of P0.30 per kilogram for its Gasul brand effective November 1 (Friday) at 12:01am; while its autoLPG for vehicles had gone up by P0.20 per liter.</p>
      <p>Its competitor Isla LPG which carries the Solane brand had jacked up its price by P0.24 per kilogram (exclusive yet of value added tax) effective November 1 at 6:00 am.</p>
