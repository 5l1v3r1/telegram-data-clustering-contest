      <p>RYANAIR passengers on a return flight to Dublin, which was supposed to take off mid-afternoon yesterday (3.15 p.m.), are still stranded at Krakow Airport in Poland.</p>
      <p>They were eventually accommodated in a hotel overnight but only after what they describe as 'hours of chaos, confusion and bedlam'.</p>
      <p>Thirty-eight of the passengers are members of a retired group of psychiatric nurses from the Castlebar area.</p>
      <p>One of them, Teresa Coady, said this afternoon (Saturday) they still have no idea when a flight will be arranged for them to return home.</p>
      <p>In all, according to Mrs. Coady, several thousand Ryanair passengers have been left stranded.</p>
      <p>“We were packed together like blades of grass in the airport for hours,” she explained. “We were later put on a bus to be transferred to another airport but halfway to the second airport the bus turned around without explanation and we were dumped back once again in Krakow.</p>
      <p>The Castlebar group say they are tired and frustrated and have been been given absolutely no idea of when they will be able to get home after their four-day break in Poland, which included a trip to Auschwitz.</p>
      <p>Ryanair has been contacted for a comment on the issue.</p>
