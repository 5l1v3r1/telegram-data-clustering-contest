      <h1>Granit Xhaka doubles down on controversial statement in Arsenal programme notes</h1>
      <h2>The Arsenal skipper released a statement on Thursday following his substitution against Crystal Palace last weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T13:02:04+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 13:02</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Granit Xhaka has used his captain's notes in Arsenal's matchday programme for Saturday's clash with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> to double down on the statement he made in midweek.</p>
      <p>The Gunners skipper spoke out on social media following the reaction to his substitution against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> last weekend, when he was roundly booed by home supporters.</p>
      <p>Fans were divided on Xhaka's statement, in which he claimed that threats had been made to his wife and daughter following the incident.</p>
      <p>Some claim that Xhaka's words don't offer enough of an apology for his reaction to the substitution, when he was seen mouthing "f*** off" towards the fans.</p>

      <p>The Swiss is not in the squad for Saturday's clash with Wolves, and also missed the midweek Carabao Cup tie defeat at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>There have been calls for Gunners boss Unai Emery to strip Xhaka of the captaincy, with the midfielder having taken up the role earlier this season following a vote among the players.</p>
      <p>In his captain's column Xhaka simply wrote: "In these notes, I hope you will respect that I just wish to repeat the message which I posted on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> on Thursday."</p>

      <p>The statement - which was tweeted by Arsenal's official <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> account - is then repeated word for word underneath.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> captain Mark Noble has vioiced his support for Xhaka, but claimed that he should probably now seek a move away from the Gunners.</p>
      <p>"Granit is one of those players who wears his heart on his sleeve and it’s tough for him at the moment," he told the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/westham/west-ham-captain-mark-noble-i-have-sympathy-for-fellow-skipper-granit-xhaka-a4276146.html">Evening Standard</a> .</p>

      <p>"In all honesty, the best solution might be to tell his agent, 'Look, they don’t like me here, so maybe it’s best if I go and play somewhere else'.</p>
      <p>"I remember Slaven Bilic telling me, 'Once the box is open, it never closes'.</p>
      <p>"The chances are that, if he makes one bad pass in the next match in which he plays, they’ll be on him again."</p>
