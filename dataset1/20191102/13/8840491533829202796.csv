Retired Mayo nurses among hundreds stranded by Ryanair crux in Poland

02 Nov 2019, 13:04

RYANAIR passengers on a return flight to Dublin, which was supposed to take off mid-afternoon yesterday (3.15 p.m.), are still stranded at Krakow Airport in Poland.
They were eventually accommodated in a hotel overnight but only after what they describe as 'hours of chaos, confusion and bedlam'.
Thirty-eight of the passengers are members of a retired group of psychiatric nurses from the Castlebar area.
One of them, Teresa Coady, said this afternoon (Saturday) they still have no idea when a flight will be arranged for them to return home.
In all, according to Mrs. Coady, several thousand Ryanair passengers have been left stranded.
“We were packed together like blades of grass in the airport for hours,” she explained. “We were later put on a bus to be transferred to another airport but halfway to the second airport the bus turned around without explanation and we were dumped back once again in Krakow.
The Castlebar group say they are tired and frustrated and have been been given absolutely no idea of when they will be able to get home after their four-day break in Poland, which included a trip to Auschwitz.
Ryanair has been contacted for a comment on the issue.
