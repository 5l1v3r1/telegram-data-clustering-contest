      <p>GOMA (Congo), Nov 2 — The Congolese medical authorities said today they had received the first shipment of a new Ebola vaccine as the central African country battles its second deadliest outbreak of the virus this decade. </p>
      <p>The health ministry for the eastern province of North Kivu said that a preliminary batch of 11,000 doses of the new Ad26-ZEBOV-GP vaccine manufactured by Johnson &amp; Johnson had arrived yesterday.</p>
      <p>In all, a shipment of a total 50,000 doses is being sent to the Democratic Republic of Congo to help fight an outbreak that has killed more than 2,100 people since August 2018. </p>
      <p>Until now, the only vaccine against the disease was one manufactured by US firm, Merck Sharpe and Dohme. </p>
      <p>The DRC’s deadliest Ebola outbreak since the West Africa pandemic in 2014-2016 has affected the provinces of North Kivu, South Kivu and Ituri and left 2,183 people dead, according to the latest official figures. </p>
      <p>Since the start of the vaccination campaign on August 8, 2018, a total 245,999 people have been vaccinated. </p>
      <p>Ebola fighters have been hindered by chronic insecurity in the affected provinces of eastern DRC, but much of the controversy surrounding the response has centred on the use of vaccines. </p>
      <p>The World Health Organization had been pushing Kinshasa for months to approve the use of the J&amp;J vaccine—an experimental product—to protect those living outside of direct transmission zones. </p>
      <p>The J&amp;J vaccine had been rejected by DRC’s former health minister Oly Ilunga, who cited the risks of introducing a new product in communities where mistrust of Ebola responders is already high.</p>
      <p>But Ilunga’s resignation in July appeared to have paved the way for the second vaccine.</p>
      <p>Jean-Jacques Muyembe, the new head of the anti-Ebola campaign, said Friday the J&amp;J vaccine would be used from mid-November with the operation being launched simultaneously in DR Congo and Rwanda. — AFP</p>
