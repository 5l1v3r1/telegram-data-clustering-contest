Nate Diaz and Jorge Masvidal clash for the BMF belt at UFC 244 at Madison Square Garden in New York
02 Nov 2019, 13:00 by Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting
Nate Diaz returns to the Octagon for the second time in three months tonight when he takes on Jorge Masvidal at UFC 244.
The Stockton native was out of action for three years following his defeat by Conor McGregor , but returned in August to beat Anthony Pettis.
He then called out Masvidal - who has recorded stunning back-to-back victories over Darren Till and Ben Askren - and the fight was quickly made.
The pair will clash tonight at Madison Square Garden in New York and on the line will be the one-off Baddest Motherf***** belt which has been specially designed and produced.
On hand to present the belt will be none other than Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson while the main event will be preceded by Till's middleweight debut against Kelvin Gastelum.

Latest news
Nate Diaz remains open to a trilogy fight with Conor McGregor - but is not desperate to face the Irishman again.
Diaz choked out McGregor in 2016 before losing their rematch six months later by decision.
He then sat out for three years before returning in August to beat Anthony Pettis to set up Saturday’s  clash with Jorge Masvidal at UFC 244.
McGregor meanwhile went on to beat Eddie Alvarez to win the lightweight title but then suffered defeats by Floyd Mayweather and Khabib Nurmagomedov.
The Dubliner is pencilled in to return to the UFC on January 18 against Donald Cerrone and wants to then face the winner of Diaz vs Masvidal.
But of a trilogy fight, Diaz said: “Maybe, maybe not, I don’t know what’s next.
“I’m going to do what I’m going to do. We’ll see what’s going to happen in the future. Like I said before, when the stars line up. I don’t know what’s next. I’m going to try to make this fight happen the way it’s supposed to happen, and we’ll go from there.
“Whatever is going to happen in the future is going to happen in the future.""
