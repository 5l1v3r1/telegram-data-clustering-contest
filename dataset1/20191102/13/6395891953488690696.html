      <p><b>SAUGUS, Mass.</b> - A 57-year-old Melrose woman crashed her car into Giovanni's Roast Beef &amp; Pizza early Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>Saugus Police and Fire responded to the pizza shop at 194 Broadway just before 7:30 a.m. First responders found a 2016 Mercedes Benz E350 that crashed roughly three-quarters of the way into the front of the building.</p>
      <p>Rescuers located the driver and evaluated her at the scene. No one was inside the building at the time since it was closed.</p>
      <p>The shop isn't allowed to reopen until any structural damage is assessed.</p>
      <p>Police are investigating the crash. An initial on-scene investigation indicated that the driver did not appear to be impaired and that human error or mechanical failure are the two most likely causes of the crash.</p>
