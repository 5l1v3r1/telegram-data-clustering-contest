      <p>SHENZHEN: An indefatigable <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Elina-Svitolina">Elina Svitolina</a> came from behind to outlast a hobbled <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Belinda-Bencic">Belinda Bencic</a> in a gruelling semi-final on Saturday, continuing her dogged quest to defend her <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/WTA-Finals">WTA Finals</a> title.</p>
      <p>The world number eight worked over an ailing Bencic with a comeback 5-7, 6-3, 4-1 victory in one hour and 50 minutes at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre. The Swiss struggled with a right leg injury from late in the first set but gamely fought on before calling it a day.</p>
      <p>She was the third player to retire mid-match in the tournament following the withdrawals of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kiki-Bertens">Kiki Bertens</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bianca-Andreescu">Bianca Andreescu</a>. World number three <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Naomi-Osaka">Naomi Osaka</a> withdrew from the year-ender before her second match against <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ashleigh-Barty">Ashleigh Barty</a>.</p>
      <p>Svitolina will play the winner of the second semi-final between Barty and Karolina Pliskova -- the top two ranked players in the world.</p>
      <p>The Ukrainian did not lose a set in the round-robin phase and remains on track to claim a maximum prize of US $4.725 million -- the highest pay cheque in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/tennis">tennis</a> history.</p>
      <p>"It's very tough for her," Svitolina said. "I'm going to leave everything on the court (in the final) to try to raise the cup again."</p>
      <p>Both players came out firing in a high-quality opening and traded winners but it was the Swiss who impressed with her aggressive approach.</p>
      <p>Bencic's freewheeling paid off when a blistering backhand return winner captured the break in the sixth game. But she couldn't capitalise on serve and then later in the set required medical attention on her right hamstring.</p>
      <p>Bencic seemed rejuvenated from the treatment and immediately pounced on a loose Svitolina service game in the 12th game to claim the set emphatically with a backhand winner down the line.</p>
      <p>Svitolina rediscovered her potent counterpunch in the second set and hit the lines to move around an increasingly frustrated Bencic, who was hampered by her troublesome right leg.</p>
      <p>Svitolina cruised through the set to draw level and her momentum continued until Bencic pulled the pin.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old is hoping to end a barren season on a high having not captured a title since last year's triumph in Singapore.</p>
