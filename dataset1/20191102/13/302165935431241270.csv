GEORGE TOWN, Nov 2 — Police are tracking down a man for threatening to bomb the North-East District Police Headquarters (IPD), here using C4 bomb in an incident yesterday as he was angry with the authorities for frequently detaining suspects.
North-East Police District Head ACP Che Zaimani Che Awang said that in the incident at about 3.30pm, the man contacted the Pulau Tikus Police Station and spoke to a policeman before suddenly cursing the policeman with various abusive words.
He said that before putting down the telephone, the suspect threatened to explode the North-East IPD using the C4 as he wanted to see all the policemen die.
