      <p>One of the highlights of the Google Pixel 4 was the Soli radar motion sensor and Google branded the Pixel 4 as the first smartphone to come with a radar. Unfortunately, The company couldn’t get approval from different countries to allow the use of radar. This forced Google into selling the device with the radar disabled in unapproved countries.</p>
      <p>Google, however, never physically removed the radar and that was one of the reasons why the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/heres-why-google-wont-be-launching-the-pixel-4-and-pixel-4-xl-in-india/">Indian government</a> banned it immediately after launch. That being said, if you bought the device in one of the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/googles-pixel-4s-motion-sensor-is-only-supported-in-these-countries-see-if-you-are-on-the-list/">supported countries</a> but plan to carry the device in an unsupported country then the internet has got you covered. First spotted by the Reddit community, Google has left a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/dprq4c/how_to_enable_soli_in_any_country_root_needed/">Motion Sense debugging option</a> inside the retail Pixel 4 unit. This option can be used to force enable motion sensor and gestures regardless of the physical location. To enable the sensor, users will need to run adb command: <i>adb shell setprop pixel.oslo.allowed_override true</i> to enable it temporarily. Alternatively users can run <i>adb shell “setprop persist.pixel.oslo.allowed_override true; setprop ctl.restart zygote” </i>to enable the sensor permanently.</p>
      <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: Pixel 4’s motion sensors use radar technology which is <b>governed at a national level</b>. Enabling the senor without the <b>explicit approval</b> from the government is <b>illegal</b> and <b>can get you in trouble</b>. Proceed at your own risk.</p>
