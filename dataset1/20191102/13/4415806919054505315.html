      <p>The government of Vietnam has said it is “deeply saddened” to learn the 39 migrants found dead in the back of a lorry are all believed to be its citizens, describing it as a “serious humanitarian tragedy”.</p>
      <p>Essex Police announced yesterday evening that it believed it knew the nationality of all the victims.</p>
      <p>Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith said: “We are in direct contact with a number of families in Vietnam and the UK, and we believe we have identified families for some of the victims whose journey ended in tragedy on our shores.”</p>
      <p>He said the force was awaiting “confirmatory evidence” in order to present the case to the coroner.</p>
      <p>Mr Smith added: “This evidence is being gathered across a number of jurisdictions worldwide. As a result, we cannot at this time announce the identity of any of the victims.”</p>
      <blockquote>We hope that the British side will soon complete the investigation to bring those responsible for this tragedy to justice</blockquote>
      <p>Le Thi Thu Hang, a spokeswoman for Vietnam’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a statement today: “This is a serious humanitarian tragedy. We are deeply saddened by the incident and wish to extend our heartfelt condolences to the victims’ families.</p>
      <p>“We wish they may soon overcome those tremendous pain and losses.”</p>
      <p>She said the Vietnamese embassy in the UK had been working closely with the British authorities to support families and help find the identities of the victims.</p>
      <p>She said the British police and the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security would publish their findings “as soon as possible”.</p>
      <p>Ms Hang continued: “Vietnam strongly condemns human trafficking and considers it a serious crime subject to strict penalties.</p>
      <p>“Vietnam calls upon countries in the region and around the world to step up cooperation in combating human trafficking in order to prevent the recurrence of such tragedy.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>She added: “We are grateful that the British Government and other relevant authorities have actively conducted the investigation, timely provided identification information to and worked in close coordination with the Vietnamese competent authorities.</p>
      <p>“We hope that the British side [will] soon complete the investigation to bring those responsible for this tragedy to justice.”</p>
      <p>The bodies of eight women and 31 men were found in a refrigerated trailer attached to a lorry in an industrial park in Grays, Essex, in the early hours of October 23.</p>
      <p>The update from Essex Police regarding the victims’ nationalities comes after the force started extradition proceedings to bring 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison from Ireland to the UK.</p>
      <p>Harrison, of Newry in Co Down, appeared in the High Court on Friday charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, along with human trafficking and immigration offences, and was remanded in custody.</p>
      <p>Detectives have also urged Ronan Hughes, 40, and his brother Christopher, 34, said to have links with the road haulage and shipping industries, to hand themselves in.</p>

      <p>The pair, from Armagh, are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking.</p>
      <p>It is understood Ronan Hughes spoke to police shortly after the driver of the lorry, Mo Robinson, 25, was arrested following the discovery.</p>
      <p>Robinson, of Craigavon, appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court on Monday charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering.</p>
      <p>Three other people arrested in connection with the incident – two men aged 38 and 46 and a 38-year-old woman – have been released on bail.</p>
      <p>In Vietnam, local media reported that police in the Ha Tinh province had arrested two people in connection with the deaths after launching an investigation into suspected human trafficking of workers.</p>
      <p>The investigation was prompted when 10 families from Nghen Town, Thien Loc, Vinh Loc and Thanh Loc contacted authorities to say they had lost contact with their relatives.</p>
      <p>It is still not known how the victims, who police initially believed were Chinese nationals, entered the lorry trailer before it travelled from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Purfleet in Essex.</p>
