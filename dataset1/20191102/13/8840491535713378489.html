      <p>TRINITY Sport, in association with Bank of Ireland, officially unveiled its sport scholars for the 2019-2020 season at an event for family and friends in the Dining Hall, Trinity College Dublin.</p>
      <p>This year’s awardees, comprising of 40 Trinity Sport scholars and 25 Club Academy scholars, include Mayo athlete and human genetics student Sorcha McAllister.</p>
      <p>Sorcha was recognised for her achievements in athletics. She is the current national Under 23 1,500m champion and represented Ireland at the European Under 23 cross country championship.</p>
      <p>Special guests on the night included Trinity Sport ambassador and motivational speaker Mark Pollock who spoke to the Trinity Sport scholars about the importance of collaboration, commenting: “Being involved in sports during my time in Trinity is what taught me how to win and lose, how to build resilience and how to be part of a team. I believe these skills not only matter in sport, but can be applied in business, science and life in general.”</p>
