ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan has lashed out at the political rivals and said that they were trying to save their “sinking ship of politics.”
“Prime Minister Imran Khan is the leader and bright face of Pakistan,” she said while talking to the media in Islamabad.
She said the world has acknowledged PM Khan’s statesmanship and World Bank president has appreciated him for working hard to revive the state’s economy.
Replying to a question, Dr Awan said we were politicians and would continue to hold dialogue with the opposition to resolve the issues.
She said the negotiation committee of the government would decide a strategy for talks with the opposition.
Replying to another question, she said Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Fazlur Rehman has broken promises made with the government.
She said breaking commitments and promises was against Islamic teachings and it was tragic that the nation was being misled on the basis of religion.
Meanwhile, in a tweet on Saturday, Dr Awan has regretted that the opposition parties were attacking the state of Pakistan to help their children reach the corridors of power.
She pointed out that only five families were standing on the container those had always remained in the power. These families, she said, include Mufti Mahmood Khan, Achakzai, Wali Khan, Bhutto and Sharifs.

Nardep Bogdan Yaremenko considers journalists sellable
People's Deputy from the ""Servant of the People"" Bogdan Yaremenko, who got into a sex scandal in the Verkhovna Rada, called the journalists ""sluts"".
Such words are contained in his comments under a Facebook post, where he announces the statement of resignation of the chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Foreign Policy and Interparliamentary Cooperation.
Yes, one commenter wrote: “I always thought that old-school diplomats should be a little scout. I see he was wrong. Even children know that most jokes work for special services, are they ready to do it for the money? ” To which Yaremenko replied: ""I just didn't think I was given accreditation in the VRU.""



We will remind, in the Verkhovna Rada the scandal occurred recently. The correspondent took a picture in the session hall of the Verkhovna Rada of correspondence of the deputy from the ""Servant of the People"" Bogdan Yaremenko in the chat chats.
The parliamentarian spoke to one of the girls, who offered him sexual services for financial gain. The girl described the conditions for the provision of intimate services and indicated that the hour of her services is $ 100.
Initially, Yaremenko stated that all this was merely a ""provocation"". However, no one believed him, and on Wednesday evening he wrote another post on social networks, where he apologized to his wife, children and Zelensky.
On October 31, Yaremenko recalled criminal responsibility for breaking the secrecy of correspondence.
On November 1, Yaremenko wrote a statement on the resignation of the chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Foreign Policy and Interparliamentary Cooperation with an open date.
