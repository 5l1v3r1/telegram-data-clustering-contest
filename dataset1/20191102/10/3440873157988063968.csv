Young Indian shuttlers Lakshya Sen and Kiran George have won their respective quarter-finals and set up an all-Indian semi-finals at the SaarLorLux Open in Saarbrucken, Germany. Sen, seeded eighth in the tournament, won his quarter-final match against Germany’s Max Weisskirchen in 29 minutes. The Youth Olympic Games silver medallist breezed through the German 21-13, 21-16. George booked his place in the last four with a 21-14, 23-21 win against 17-year-old Christo Popov of France. The 19-year-old needed just 10 minutes more than his compatriot Sen, as George took 39 minutes to seal his last-four berth.
George, who is ranked 156 in the world, is yet to drop a game at the Super 100 tournament and will be confident of causing an upset when he is up against Sen on Saturday. George has already ousted a seeded player when he defeated sixth seed Toma Junior Popov in the second round.
World No 51 Sen, meanwhile, is looking to clinch back-to-back Super 100 titles after his Dutch Open win earlier in October as he continues to impress in the senior circuit. If the 18-year-old, who hails from Uttarakhand, indeed goes all the way, it will be a hat-trick of titles as his previous two tournaments (Dutch Open Super 100 and Belgian International Challenge) saw him emerge victorious as well.
The semi-final in Saarbrucken on Saturday will be the fifth meeting between George and Sen in the international arena, with Sen keeping a clean sweep record, winning all four previous matches. The winner between George and Sen will meet either Weng Hong Yang or fifth seed Toby Penty in the final.

Kyrgyz president pledges to prevent clan rule from returning in country

02 Nov 2019, 10:18

Kyrgyz President Sooronbai Jeenbekov on Saturday at an informal meeting with reporters promised to prevent the return of clan rule in the country, Tengrinews.kz reports citing RIA Novosti.
According to the head of state, the people of Kyrgyzstan have already seen clan rule and are now showing distrust of the president due to the fact that he has many relatives.
""Clan rule will not return. I will firmly keep my environment, there must be discipline!"" - said Jeenbekov.
As the leader of the country, he ""grew up among the people."" He and his brothers and sisters, he said, ""have a good upbringing.""
""Our relations will not harm anyone. If there are any facts - say, write. If my relatives have something illegal to do with it, I will take measures,"" Jeenbekov told reporters.
The first president of Kyrgyzstan, a physicist, academician Askar Akayev, has led the republic since it gained sovereignty in 1990. He was fired as a result of the color ""tulip"" revolution on March 24, 2005 and left the country. The reason for the discontent of the population was, in particular, the actions of family members and associates of the ex-president who participated in the privatization of large state assets. President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who took his place, was also forced to flee the republic after the April 2010 revolution.
