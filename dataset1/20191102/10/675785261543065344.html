      <p>A mum struggling with postnatal depression who feels like 'every day is a battle' has hailed a stranger who stepped in during a moment of need.</p>
      <p>Stephanie Brisbane was already having a bad day when she went to to pick up her much-needed parental leave payment.</p>
      <p>After being told she would instead have to wait four months to receive the money due to an 'administrative error' by Centrelink in Australia, the 32-year-old from Sydney broke down in tears.</p>
      <p>With her three young children becoming restless around her, a stranger walked over without a word, gave her children a phone to play with to keep them entertained and offered Stephanie a tissue, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/01/grateful-mum-thanks-kind-stranger-offered-gesture-crisis-11026969/">as reported by the Metro</a> .</p>

      <p>"She didn’t know that I have literally just moved house and living out of boxes in chaos and it’s taking a toll.</p>
      <p>"She didn’t know that I have bad postnatal depression and everyday is a battle and lately it’s been taking a toll.</p>
      <p>"She just knew that I was a struggling mum."</p>

      <p>Stephanie posted what had happened on a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> group to find the stranger who came to her rescue and found it was a mum-of-three named Kelly.</p>
      <p>The Good Samaritan replied: "Something honestly just made me get up and come over. I saw myself in you."</p>
      <p>After thanking her helper, Stephanie found the random acts of kindness didn't stop there.</p>
      <p>The letting agency which the family had used during their move also spotted the post online, and promptly delivered a huge supply of food to 'reduce the stress'.</p>
      <p>Stephanie wrote just how grateful she was for the support she had been given, promising to pay it forward, and others loved her feel-good tale.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "There sure are some beautiful, kind people in the world."</p>
