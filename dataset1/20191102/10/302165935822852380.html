      <p>SEPANG, Nov 2 — Sepang International Circuit (SIC) chief executive officer Datuk Razlan Razali has expressed disappointment over a theft which occurred at the Sepang Circuit.</p>
      <p>He said the incident had marred the image of SIC, especially with regard to the standard of security during the Malaysia Motorcycle Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>“I am disappointed over this incident because we have carefully prepared in cooperation with DORNA (MotoGP organising rights holder) to safeguard not only the riders but also their property.</p>
      <p>“I am angry because although we are fully prepared, there are some who do this to tarnish the name of the country and circuit as the promoter of world-class sports,” he told the media at Sepang Circuit today.</p>
      <p>The theft, which hit several teams, is believed to have occurred early Friday between 1am and 5am during heavy rain.</p>
      <p>Among the most affected by the incident was the Angel Nieto Team, which lost several spare parts such as front tyres, suspension and brakes for Moto2 and Moto3 class bikes.</p>
      <p>“What I learnt after a meeting with the team is that there may be a group that already knows what they wanted to steal.</p>
      <p>“For example, there are front and rear tyres but they only took the front tyres. They know what spare parts to use on the machine,” he said.</p>
      <p>Razlan said SIC had lodged a police report on the incident but the losses suffered have yet to be determined.</p>
      <p>He said the compensation for the affected teams will be covered by insurance.</p>
      <p>Razlan said the Sepang Circuit is closely monitored, including by closed-circuit camera (CCTV), and is also taking strict oversight by establishing an accreditation scanning system starting this year. — Bernama</p>
