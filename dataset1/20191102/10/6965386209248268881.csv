Директорите решават - учебен ли ще е понеделник

02 Nov 2019, 10:56

Денят след втория тур на изборите - понеделник, ще е или учебен, или присъствен за учениците като решението ще зависи от директорите.
""Училищата решават в зависимост от това колко време им е необходимо да създадат организацията, две стаи трябва да се изчистят и подредят, това може да стане сравнително бързо, да започнат малко по късно, с малко намаление на часовете и да проведат учебен ден, дори училището да учи на две смени. Но има училища с много голям брой секции, където това е невъзможно да се направи за един, два или три часа"", обясни министърът на образованието и науката Красимир Вълчев.
Училищата са тези, които трябва да решат, добави министърът. Според него едно започване от обяд предполага половин час формален учебен процес, затова подходът е диференциран.
В понеделника след първия тур на изборите общинските музеи и галерии обявиха вход свободен или символична такса, за да могат повече ученици да ги посетят. В някои училища имаше спортен полуден.
