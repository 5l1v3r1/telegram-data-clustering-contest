      <h1>Bitcoin Price Analysis: The Suspicious Calmness Anticipating a Huge BTC Move Following Last Saturday’s $4,000 Surge</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T10:45:44+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author">Yuval Gov</a></address>
      <p>The past weekend was crazy even for the most experienced crypto traders, who couldn’t remember when was the last time they saw a 42% change in the price of Bitcoin in under 24 hours took place.</p>
      <p>Since then, Bitcoin’s raging volatility had been declining as the weekdays passed, and now, precisely a week since the colossal $4,000 price surge, it looks like the next move is a matter of hours, maybe 1-2 days.</p>
      <p>At least one sign is pointing bullish – Bitcoin kept above the significant <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-crypto-technical-analysis-beginners/">200-days moving average line</a> (marked light green on the following chart) for the whole week since it was broken above during Saturday.</p>
      <p>The bad news is that the MA line is slowly climbing, and as of writing this, it lies around $9,060, which makes the current price levels a little fragile getting very close to it.</p>
      <p>The trading volume, <a href="https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/7d?c=e&amp;r=day&amp;t=b">aggregated</a> from the top crypto exchanges, is declining since last Saturday’s action. This also supports the idea of a huge coming-up price move.</p>
      <p>The RSI indicator (daily) is stable around the 56 resistance turned support price area. This is another decision point.</p>
      <p>Total Market Cap: $247.6 billion</p>
      <p>Bitcoin Market Cap: $167 billion</p>
      <p>BTC Dominance Index: 67.5%</p>

      <h3>Key Levels to Watch</h3>
      <p><b>– Support/Resistance:</b> From below, the first level of support is the nearby $9200 price level. Right below lies the 200-days moving average line – currently around $9,060, as mentioned above. Further below is the $8900 – $9000, including strong resistance (which held the current price level nicely). The next level of possible support is the Golden Fibonacci, 61.8%, roughly around $8500, followed by $8400.</p>
      <p>In case of a break-up, Bitcoin’s next serious resistance area is the $9400 – $9500, which Bitcoin failed to break two days ago. Further above is $9800 before the significant $10,000 legendary resistance (lots of seller’s supply chunks waiting there, as can be seen on the chart by the VPVR – attached to the right side in light blue). Further above lies $10,300 – $10,400 (Saturday’s high). Higher targets are $10,600 and $11,000 (significant resistance).</p>
