The UFC is in New York City tonight and a title (of sorts) is on the line as Jorge Masvidal takes on Nate Diaz for the UFC’s BMF belt.

The winner of Masvidal and Diaz will be granted a novelty BMF title at the end of this one. The term was coined by Diaz and later used often by he and his opponent before the UFC co-opted the term (and then began marketing it).

Diaz comes to this fight after a win over Anthony Pettis at UFC 241 in August. Masvidal made it to Madison Square Garden after breaking the internet with his lightning fast KO over Ben Askren at UFC 239 in July.
Joke belts aside, the winner of this one will likely find themselves knocking on the door of a title shot in the welterweight division.

The rest of the PPV card promises some exciting match-ups featuring well known names. The co-main is a middleweight bout between Kelvin Gastelum (who needed help on the scales) and Darren TIll (who needed luck at border security). Also on the PPV is a welterweight clash between Stephen Thompson and Vincente Luque, a heavyweight showdown between Derrick Lewis and Blagoy Ivanov and a lightweight fight pitting Kevin Lee against Gregor Gillespie.
The prelim card is headlined by Corey Anderson and the always entertaining Johnny Walker; that fight is in the light heavyweight division. Rounding out the prelims is Shane Burgos vs. Makwan Amirkhani (featherweight), Brad Tavares vs. Edmen Shahbazyan (middleweight), and Andrei Arlovksi vs. Jairzinho Rozenstruik (heavyweight).
The early prelims offer three fights tonight. Those are Julio Arce vs. Hakeem Dawodu (featherweight), Lyman Good vs. Chance Rencountre (welterweight), and Jennifer Maia vs. Kaitlyn Chookagian (catchweight after Maia missed weight).
