Danielle Lloyd's Onlyfans account appears to be thriving since she opened up the online subscription account.
The former Playboy model, 35, who previously hung up her lingerie as she took a step back from getting her kit off in glossy shoots, returned to the industry in October by giving her fans a chance to oogle her fabulous figure if they pay a monthly fee.
Proving her account is a success, the bombshell has risen the price from $19.99 USD per calendar month to $25 USD and is now offering fans a chance to purchase topless snaps for £115.
The newlywed reportedly advertised the deal for her semi-nude photos on her OnlyFans page, according to The Sun , as well as giving her followers a chance to watch her pose in a sizzling shoot if thy enter a raffle - which is £12 a ticket.
