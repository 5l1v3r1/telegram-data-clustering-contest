      <h3>THE government, through the elite Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group (PNP-HPG), is out to lessen the number of vehicular accidents in various parts of the country.</h3>
      <p>PNP-HPG records show that a total of 9,663 road crashes were recorded nationwide for the first nine months of the year, killing 1,186 persons and hurting 8,376 others.</p>
      <p>Last year, the group recorded 11,179 road mishaps that led to the death of 1,50l persons and injuries to 13,233 others.</p>
      <p>Today, we see a government that appears committed to address the problems confronting the commuting public, notably drivers, conductors, passengers and even pedestrians.</p>
      <p>Certainly, the PNP-HPG under B/Gen. Dionardo Carlos has a multi-pronged and highly-effective “program of action” aimed at ensuring the safety of land travel across the country.</p>
      <p>Part of the program is educating the country’s drivers of both public and private motor vehicles on responsible driving and continued road clearing operations as decreed by President Duterte.</p>
      <p>“Tutulong kami sa local government units sa clearing operations para mas maging maluwag, may space ang motorista para sila ay makapagpatakbo ng sasakyan,” said the one-star PNP general.</p>
      <p>Nobody will argue with the PNP-HPG director, a known disciplinarian, when he said: “If we reduce these mistakes, ang human factor, mas magiging ligtas ang driver at rider.”</p>
      <p>Carlos, a former spokesman of the 190,000-member PNP which is civilian in nature but national in scope, attributed vehicular accidents to human error and lack of road discipline.</p>
      <p>Lack of discipline includes overspeeding, drunk driving, bad overtaking, use of mobile phone while driving, bad turning, mechanical defects and poor maintenance, he said.</p>
      <p>We cannot overemphasize the importance of concerned government authorities reminding our motorists, passengers and even pedestrians to obey traffic laws, rules and regulations.</p>
