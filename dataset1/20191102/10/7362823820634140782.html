      <h1>Pennsylvania Democrat apologizes for calling early miscarriages ‘just some mess on a napkin’</h1>

      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> state lawmaker sparked an uproar on social media this week when she was seen on video describing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/reproductive-health/pregnancy">early miscarriages</a> as “just some mess on a napkin.”</p>
      <p>State Rep. Wendy Ullman, a Democrat from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local">Bucks County</a>, made the remark Tuesday during a state House <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health">Health</a> Committee hearing, according to reports.</p>

      <p>On Friday, three days after the comment, Ullman posted an apology on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“This issue is intensely important to me,” she wrote, “and that’s why I struggled for words. My words were poorly chosen, and I apologize. I remain steadfast that every single step of a medical process, including the handling of remains, should be decided by a patient and her doctor.”</p>

      <p>According to the Washington Times, Ullman was speaking at the hearing in opposition to a proposed bill calling for fetal remains to be cremated or buried, regardless of gestational age.</p>
      <p>“[House Bill 1890] refers specifically to the product of conception after fertilization, which covers an awful lot of territory,” Ullman said, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/31/wendy-ullman-pa-lawmaker-slammed-for-calling-early/">according to the Times</a>. “I think we all understand the concept of the loss of a fetus, but we’re also talking about a woman who comes into a facility and is having cramps and — not to be, not to be, concrete — an early miscarriage is just some mess on a napkin.”</p>
      <p>The video of Ullman making the remarks circulated on social media, drawing a torrent of reaction.</p>
      <p>“I spent three months unable to get out of bed, mourning that ‘mess on a napkin.’ She can f--- off,” one woman wrote.</p>

      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/PoliticalSock/status/1190426809407590400">One man wrote</a>: “My wife went into a serious depression following a miscarriage. It was 22 years ago. I’ve seen nothing like it before or since. Scared me like nothing before or since.”</p>
      <p>I miscarried my first child. I cried every day it seemed like forever,” <a href="https://twitter.com/maryjveld/status/1190429323548921858">another Twitter user wrote</a>.</p>
      <p>“What a callous person,” <a href="https://twitter.com/NCoronaBlazier/status/1190402119871938560">another woman commented</a>. “Hearing those words broke my heart. I have lost three babies. That ‘mess on a napkin’ devastates me everyday. 16 years ago, 12 years ago, and 6 years ago.”</p>

      <p>Last month , a CBS News correspondent <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/cbs-correspondent-miscarriage-covering-wildfires-blamed-myself">opened up</a> about suffering a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/reproductive-health/pregnancy">miscarriage</a> while on assignment in 2017 covering wildfires.</p>
      <p>Mireya Villarreal, who penned a personal essay titled <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/getting-past-the-stigma-of-miscarriages-mireya-villarreal/">"'Did I cause this?' Getting past the stigma of miscarriages”</a> for CBS News, said she continues to struggle with guilt despite <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/womens-health">doctors reassuring</a> her that it was not her fault.</p>
      <p><a href="https://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancy-complications/miscarriage/">According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)</a>, anywhere from 10 to 25 percent of all clinically recognized pregnancies will end in miscarriage, with the most occurring during the first 13 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
