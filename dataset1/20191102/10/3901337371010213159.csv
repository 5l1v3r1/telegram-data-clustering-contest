New Face In Pirates’ Squad For Chiefs
02 Nov 2019, 10:15 by Soccer Laduma
Kaizer Chiefs could be surprised by Orlando Pirates with a return of a top performer from the previous match between two teams. 
Following his superb performance against Chiefs in the Carling Black Label Cup match in July as the Buccaneers emerged as the 2-0 winners to claim the bragging rights, defender Justice Chabalala has been out of the picture completely, this after making only one appearance in the league since that memorable encounter for him at FNB Stadium.

The 27-year-old centre-back had been voted to Bucs’ starting line-up by the supporters, as per the rules of the competition.
Chabalala’s single appearance in the league was during the second match of the season in August – the 3-0 loss to SuperSport United.

In line with what Pirates coach Rhulani Mokwena alluded to during the week in building up to this afternoon's match, it seems there is a plan by the technical team to continue rotating their starting line-up for the different matches, with an indication from camp that Chabalala has been included in Bucs’ travelling squad.
However, it is not yet clear at this stage if the Giyani-born player will be in starting line-up, though it has been confirmed that he is part of the team that travelled to Durban yesterday (Friday).
