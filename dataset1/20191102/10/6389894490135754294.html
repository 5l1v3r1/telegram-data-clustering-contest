      <p>Essex Police have also made a direct appeal to two other suspects.</p>
      <p>Police spoke on the phone to Ronan Hughes, 40, who is wanted along with his brother, Christopher Hughes, 34.</p>
      <p>Essex Police’s detective chief inspector Daniel Stoten said: “Today I want to make a direct appeal – Ronan and Christopher, hand yourselves in to the Police Service of Northern Ireland </p>
      <p>“We need you both to come forward and assist this investigation.”</p>
      <p>Both are rom Armagh in Northern Ireland and believed to have links to the Republic of Ireland, and to the road haulage and shipping industries.</p>
      <p>Mr Stoten added: “Although we have already spoken to Ronan Hughes recently by telephone we need to have a conversation with him and his brother in person.</p>
