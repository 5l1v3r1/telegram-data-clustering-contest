      <h1>United States National Debt Hits 23 Trillion — Over $1M Per Bitcoin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T10:47:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 10:47</time> by <a rel="author">Adrian Zmudzinski</a></address>
      <p>The United States national debt is now over $23 trillion, according to <a href="https://www.usdebtclock.org/">website</a> U.S Debt Clock.</p>
      <p>It is also worth noting that the debt per United States citizen is $69,724 and that the debt to gross domestic product ratio is 106.65%.</p>
      <p>The milestone has been <a href="https://twitter.com/Rhythmtrader/status/1190373441947553792">pointed out</a> on Nov. 1 by Bitcoin advocate Twitter personality Rhythm, who also said that every dollar of U.S. national debt is, in fact, a reason to buy Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>). Another user presented another interesting take <a href="https://twitter.com/beecapitalbv/status/1190377735375532039">adding</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“That’s more than $1,000,000 debt per 1 Bitcoin.”</blockquote>
      <h3>“All fiat money will die”</h3>
      <p>Host of the Keiser Report and cryptocurrency entrepreneur, Max Keiser, also says that central banks are contributing to Bitcoin’s success in a recent interview with tech news outlet Hackernoon <a href="https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-bear-market-diaries-volume-19-max-keiser-79ee0006b095">published</a> on Nov. 1. </p>
      <p>For instance, the impact of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing">quantitative easing</a> monetary policy on the price of Bitcoin:</p>
      <blockquote>“It bottomed when the Fed signaled ‘Infinite QE’ recently at around $3,300 BTC. Global Central Banking is about to go bust. [...] All fiat money will die.”</blockquote>
      <p>As Cointelegraph recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-fed-just-printed-more-money-than-bitcoins-entire-market-cap">reported</a>, Bitcoin proponents rang the alarm bells, pointing out that since mid-September, the U.S. Fed has effectively created hundreds of billions in new money — more than Bitcoin’s entire market cap of $165B — in a just a matter of days.</p>
