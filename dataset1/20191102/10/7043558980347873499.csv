Human tide in Algiers for a ""new revolution""

02 Nov 2019, 10:43

A human tide spread Friday in the streets of Algiers to demand a ""new independence"", 65 years to the day after the start of the armed struggle against the French colonizer.
The absence of official or independent counting and topography made it impossible to count demonstrators. But in this 37th consecutive Friday of demonstration, the mobilization was similar to those observed at the height of ""Hirak"", the unprecedented protest movement of the regime that Algeria has been playing since February 22nd.
Before beginning to disperse without incident in the late afternoon, the huge procession progressed very slowly for several hours in the black streets of the world, around the Grande Poste, emblematic building in the heart of Algiers and became the gathering place for weekly events.
The demonstrators chanted ""Algeria wants its independence"", ""the people want their independence"".
On November 1, 1954, the newly created National Liberation Front (FLN) triggered the ""Algerian Revolution"" and the armed struggle for independence, with a series of simultaneous attacks on Algerian territory. Decreed ""Feast of the Revolution"", the date is a holiday in Algeria.
""The elders have fought against France, we are fighting the mafia system that has confiscated our independence,"" said AFP M'hand, a retired 63-year-old, who left at 05:00 in the morning from Boumerdes, about 40 km away. East of Algiers, to reach the capital.
""# Hirak_du_1er_novembre"", ""#Envahissons_la_capitale"": these last days on social networks, these new hashtags in Arabic had called the Algerians to converge massively towards the capital.
Many of them came from other regions, despite the traffic jams due to the numerous gendarmerie checkpoints at the entrances to Algiers or the total absence on Friday of trains to the capital.

- ""Chained"" -

Some spent the night on the sidewalks. Hocine, in her twenties, and her four friends from Lakhdaria, about sixty miles away, spent the night in their car.
""We put France out in 1962, but we did not enjoy freedom with this regime that has not changed since. We want a new Algeria, ""said the young man.
A retired teacher, 62-year-old Nadia Foufa recalls having marched on the 5th of July 1962, during the proclamation of independence: ""I was five years old and we were happy about this independence. But now we are chained and there is no freedom.
For several days on social networks, many ""digital leaflets"" called for massive mobilization, drawing a parallel between November 1, 1954 and 2019.
""You are all concerned. Call on the Algerian people to prepare for (...) storming the capital by the millions and coming from all wilayas (prefectures) on Friday, November 1, until all the bandits ""to come to power, proclaims one of them.
"" The story repeats itself. November 1, 1954-2019. The 48 wilayas in the capital ""for a new"" war of liberation "", can we read about another.

- ""Element of Hirak"" -

Major events have also taken place in many cities across the country, according to online media and social networks.
Since he obtained in early April, the resignation of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the ""Hirak"", ""movement"" without official structure or leader, does not weaken and now claims the dismantling of the ""system"" in power since 1962.
The protesters strongly oppose the presidential election that the government organizes on December 12 to elect a successor to Mr. Bouteflika, considering that it aims only to regenerate this ""system"".
The government, which considers that it has satisfied the demands of the dispute with the departure of Mr. Bouteflika and the lockdown of ""corrupt"" personalities, seeks to minimize the scope of the movement.
On Wednesday, General Ahmed Gaïd Salah, chief of staff of the army and strongman of the country since the resignation of Mr. Bouteflika, assured that the poll collected the ""total adherence"" of citizens.
An assertion contradicted by ""Clear Gaid Salah! There will be no vote this year! ""That resounded in the streets, responding at the same time to the call made Thursday to Algerians, by the acting President Abdelkader Bensalah, to go to the polls massively.
In addition to the monster mobilization on Friday, many citizens responded to a challenge on the internet, consisting of filming themselves, alone or in groups, saying: ""I am an Algerian and I am an element of Hirak.
An ironic response to recent remarks by Bensalah, telling Russian President Vladimir Putin that the scale of the movement was ""exaggerated"" and was limited to ""a few elements (who) go out on the streets every week"".
