The student, the goldsmith, sold the silver for the silver

02 Nov 2019, 10:29 PM

A goldsmith apprentice designed and executed a scenario of kidnapping and robbing 4k gold bars to avenge his lazy owner.
Iran wrote: A few days ago a frightened middle-aged man contacted the police and reported his abduction and theft of gold. ""I have a goldsmith in the market,"" he said. This morning I was on my way back to my shop after purchasing 10kg of bullets, two men dressed in their appearance as police officers claiming to have blocked my way and claiming that they had received a report of gold smuggling against me and then began an inspection. They stabbed me and when they saw the gold bars, they asked me to get in their car to the police station. I got on board, but a few minutes later I noticed that they were aimless in the city, and an hour later, on Khavaran Road. I doubted their behavior and said I should tell my family. The anonymous men agreed to my request, and while holding the car, they gave me my cellphone to call. I got out of the car and tried to get my bag, which was not allowed, and in one glance the driver put his foot down on the gas. I wanted to get their license plate number, which I found to be corrupted. It was there that I realized they were burglars, not police officers.

Police clues

Upon the complaint of the middle-aged man, a case was immediately filed in the ninth branch of the Tehran Criminal Prosecutor's Office and an investigation was launched to investigate the case. Investigations by the goldsmith continued to provide officials with the first clue. He said: ""My student has changed his behavior for a few days and comes to the store wearing expensive clothes. Yesterday he told me he wouldn't work with me until the end of the month."" However, he was not in good financial shape and was always afraid of firing me.

Arrest of shop student

With a tip given to the investigation team by the goldsmith, the student's detectives tracked him down, and investigations revealed that he had been deposited a few days after the robbery. He was arrested by police for his involvement in the theft of bullets. Amir - a goldsmith - initially denied the involvement in the robbery, but soon after confessed to the robbery and let down his accomplices.

Why did you betray your landlord?

He was a jerk, even though I worked for him for many years, but he was not willing to increase my salary. I was also scared of being fired and unemployed because I didn't have good finances and the cost of living was heavy. But I had a grudge against him.

How did the plan for the robbery come to your mind?

One day I was in pain for one of my old friends when he proposed the robbery and told me to take revenge on the goldsmith and make money for myself. I agreed, and he told the matter to two of his friends and told them the day the goldsmith went to buy bullions and the robbery was done.

What did you do with the ingots?

We sold a lot of bullions for about four and a half billion dollars and divided the money between the four of us. I bought cars, motorcycles and clothes with his money, of course, some bullets.
