根據國家統計局的數據，今年前九個月，全國新房包括住宅、辦公樓和商業物業銷售面積同比下降0.1%，但銷售價值同比增長7.1%。其中，新住宅銷售面積同比小幅增長1.1%，銷售價值同比增長10.3%；數據反映銷售額增長主要是由平均售價的上升所驅動，銷量的增長微乎其微。
一線城市樓價上漲
據國家統計局對70個城市的新房價格調查， 9月份四個一線城市新建商品住宅銷售價格環比上漲0.4%，漲幅比上月擴大0.1個百分點，同比上漲4.6%，漲幅比上月擴大0.4個百分點。其中，北京和廣州持平，上海和深圳分別環比上漲0.5%和1.2%。二手住宅銷售價格環比上漲0.3%，上月為持平，同比上漲0.1%，上月為下降0.2%；其中，北京和廣州分別環比下降0.5%和0.3%，上海和深圳分別環比上漲0.6%和1.3%。
31個二線城市新建商品住宅銷售價格環比上漲0.6%，漲幅比上月擴大0.1個百分點，同比上漲9.3%，漲幅比上月分別回落0.6個百分點；二手住宅銷售價格環比上漲0.2%，漲幅與上月相同，同比上漲4.7%，漲幅比上月回落0.8個百分點。35個三線城市新建商品住宅銷售價格環比上漲0.8%，漲幅比上月擴大0.1個百分點，同比上漲8.4%，漲幅比上月回落0.6個百分點；二手住宅銷售價格環比上漲0.7%，漲幅比上月回落0.1個百分點，同比上漲5.0 %，漲幅比上月回落0.8個百分點。
因此，全國或主要城市住宅價格統計數據表明住宅價格平均上漲；但是，在一些房地產新聞中也看到，由於銷售勢頭減弱，一些房地產開發商降價以促進銷售。
內地大多數大型房地產開發商已在A股市場或港股市場上市；其每月的合同銷售業績，可讓資本市場對房地產市場趨勢有深入的了解。前九個月，內地房地產銷售額排名前五位香港上市的開發商，分別是萬科企業（02202）、中國恒大（03333）、碧桂園（02007）、中國海外發展（00688）和新城發展（01030），其各自的合約銷售額同比增長分別為10.2%、1.1%、1.8%、28.2%和23.9%。這前五大房地產開發商的合約銷售面積，分別增長了5.5%、0.4%、-2.0%、11.​​7%和35.4%。
恒大碧桂園表現落後
可以看出，恒大和碧桂園的合約銷售額增速或銷量增長，明顯低於國家統計局的全國新房銷售額平均增速。
國家統計局的統計數據表明，內地房地產市場仍處於增長階段，但大型開發商的銷售業績已經出現分化。也許，很大的差異是由於他們的房地產項目的位置。數據顯示，前九個月，東部和東北地區的新房銷售面積分別同比下降2.9%和5.9%，中部地區微增0.5%，而西部地區則增長4.6%。因此，不同地區的房地產銷售也出現了明顯的差異。免責聲明：本專頁刊載的所有投資分析技巧，只可作參考用途。市場瞬息萬變，讀者在作出投資決定前理應審慎，並主動掌握市場最新狀況。若不幸招致任何損失，概與本刊及相關作者無關。而本集團旗下網站或社交平台的網誌內容及觀點，僅屬筆者個人意見，與新傳媒立場無關。本集團旗下網站對因上述人士張貼之資訊內容所帶來之損失或損害概不負責。

02 Nov 2019, 10:00 by Investment
There are a lot of news in the mainland real estate market recently, including industry policy news, real estate developer sales performance news and regular real estate sales statistics and price statistics; investors face a variety of positive and negative news, some of which are contradictory and chaotic.

According to the National Bureau of Statistics, in the first nine months of this year, the sales area of ​​new homes including residential, office and commercial properties fell by 0.1% year-on-year, but the sales value increased by 7.1%. Among them, the sales area of ​​new residential buildings increased slightly by 1.1% year-on-year, and the sales value increased by 10.3% year-on-year; the data reflected that the sales growth was mainly driven by the increase in average selling price, and the sales growth was minimal.
First-tier city property prices rose
According to the National Bureau of Statistics survey of new home prices in 70 cities, the sales price of new commercial residential buildings in four first-tier cities rose by 0.4% in September, an increase of 0.1 percentage points over the previous month and a year-on-year increase of 4.6%. The increase was 0.4 more than the previous month. percentage point. Among them, Beijing and Guangzhou were flat, and Shanghai and Shenzhen rose by 0.5% and 1.2% respectively. Second-hand residential sales prices rose by 0.3% month-on-month, last month was flat, up 0.1% year-on-year, down 0.2% last month; among them, Beijing and Guangzhou were down 0.5% and 0.3% respectively, Shanghai and Shenzhen were up 0.6% and 1.3% respectively. %.
The sales price of new commercial residential buildings in 31 second-tier cities increased by 0.6% from the previous month, and the growth rate was 0.1 percentage points higher than that of the previous month, up 9.3% year-on-year, and the growth rate was 0.6 percentage points lower than that of the previous month. The sales price of second-hand residential houses rose by 0.2% from the previous month. The same as last month, it rose by 4.7% year-on-year, and the growth rate dropped by 0.8 percentage points from the previous month. The sales price of new commercial residential buildings in 35 third-tier cities increased by 0.8% from the previous month, and the growth rate was 0.1 percentage points higher than that of the previous month, up 8.4% year-on-year, and the growth rate was 0.6 percentage points lower than that of the previous month. The sales price of second-hand residential houses rose by 0.7% from the previous month. It fell by 0.1 percentage points, up 5.0% year-on-year, and the growth rate dropped by 0.8 percentage points from the previous month.
As a result, residential or major city housing price statistics indicate that housing prices have risen on average; however, in some real estate news, some real estate developers have cut prices to boost sales as sales momentum has weakened.
Most of the large real estate developers in the Mainland have listed on the A-share market or the Hong Kong stock market; their monthly contract sales performance allows the capital market to have an in-depth understanding of the real estate market trends. In the first nine months, the top five Hong Kong-listed developers in mainland real estate sales were Vanke (02202), China Evergrande (03333), Country Garden (02007), China Overseas Development (00688) and New Town Development ( 01030), their respective contracted sales increased by 10.2%, 1.1%, 1.8%, 28.2% and 23.9%, respectively. The contracted sales area of ​​the top five real estate developers increased by 5.5%, 0.4%, -2.0%, 11.7% and 35.4% respectively.
Evergrande Country Garden is behind
It can be seen that the growth rate or sales growth of contract sales of Evergrande and Country Garden is significantly lower than the average growth rate of national new house sales by the National Bureau of Statistics.
The statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics show that the mainland real estate market is still in the growth stage, but the sales performance of large developers has been divided. Perhaps, the big difference is due to the location of their real estate projects. Data show that in the first nine months, the sales area of ​​new homes in the eastern and northeastern regions decreased by 2.9% and 5.9% respectively, the central region increased slightly by 0.5%, while the western region increased by 4.6%. As a result, there have been significant differences in real estate sales in different regions. Disclaimer: All investment analysis techniques published on this page are for reference only.
