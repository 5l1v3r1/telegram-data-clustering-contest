Witness: After the drought .. Floods displaced more than 270 thousand Somalis, including 100,000 children
02 Nov 2019, 10:04 by euronews



Torrential flooding in many parts of Somalia has displaced more than 270,000 people by the end of October, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
OCHA said 230,000 of the displaced were in the Baladwayne district of the center of the country, where heavy rains destroyed agricultural land and infrastructure due to the flooding of the Shabelle river.
According to the Norwegian Refugee Council, the number of Somalis left homeless by drought and floods as well as bloody conflict reached 575,000 in 2019.
The floods cut electricity and destroyed food stores. Reports indicate that children, mothers and the elderly are at risk of hunger and disease, according to the OCHA statement.
Somalia has been plagued by conflict and anarchy since 1991 when dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown.
