      <h1>Bottas expecting a close battle but admits he was off the pace in FP2</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> spent large portions of the first practice session testing the 2020 Pirelli prototype and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/valtteri-bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a> has admitted development was the key focus during the opening session.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bottas finished down in 18th in FP1 having been running the Pirelli prototypes, he only finished ahead of <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lando-norris">Lando Norris</a> and the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/williams">Williams</a> pair. <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> managed eighth in the first session but both were amongst the leaders in FP2 as Hamilton topped the timesheets with Bottas down in P5.</p>
      <p>Bottas admitted that the morning session was more about development than anything else and that not much can be read into it.</p>
      <p><i>"This morning was all about development work for next year, so the lap times didn’t really matter,"</i> Bottas said.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"We were focusing on gathering data on the new tyres which was quite interesting and just went through our programme without worrying too much about lap times.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"It looks pretty close between the teams at the top, but I personally struggled a bit in FP2. I lost some time on the straights and the car didn’t feel quite right, so that’s something we will have to look at tonight."</i>
