      <p>NEW DELHI: "I was playing against 21 people -- 11 theirs and 10 ours," said former speedster <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shoaib-Akhtar">Shoaib Akhtar</a>, once again fuelling match-fixing allegations against his former Pakistan teammates.</p>
      <p>Pakistan cricket had plunged into one of its many crises in recent years when fast bowler <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/mohammad-amir">Mohammad Amir</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mohammad-Asif">Mohammad Asif</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Salman-Butt">Salman Butt</a> were banned for spot-fixing in 2011.</p>
      <p>"I was always of the belief that I can never cheat Pakistan, no match-fixing but I was surrounded by match-fixers. I was playing against 21 people (sic) -- 11 theirs and 10 ours. Who knows who was the match-fixer," Akhtar said during a talk show 'Rewind With Samina Peerzada'.</p>
      <p>"There was so much match-fixing. Asif told me which all matches they had fixed and how they did it."</p>
      <p>Akhtar said he was livid when he came to know that Amir and Asif had indulged in corruption during a Test against England.</p>
      <p>"I tried to make Amir and Asif understand. What a waste of talent. When I heard about this, I was so upset that I punched the wall," said the 44-year-old retired pacer.</p>
      <p>"Pakistan's two top bowlers, smart, intelligent and the two perfect fast bowlers were wasted. They sold themselves for a little money."</p>
      <p>Of the suspended trio, only Amir managed to make a successful comeback to international cricket.</p>
      <p>The pacer was instrumental in Pakistan winning the 2017 Champions Trophy, beating India in the final. He was also a part of the Pakistan team during the 50-over World Cup in England.</p>
