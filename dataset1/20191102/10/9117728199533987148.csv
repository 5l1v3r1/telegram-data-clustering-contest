Alex Albon is making his first appearance at the US Grand Prix and the Thai driver put in a good shift finishing third in FP1 and sixth in FP2. Albon admitted he's enjoying his time around the Circuit of the Americas.

Albon led for large parts of the first session of the weekend but he eventually finished third, behind his teammate Max Verstappen and Sebastian Vettel. As the Mercedes came back into it in FP2 having tested the 2020 tyres in FP1, Albon dropped down to P6 but was still impressive on his first time around the track in Texas.
“I’m enjoying my first time around this track and it’s been really good fun so far,"" Albon told the Red Bull website.

""It’s quite technical and there’s a lot of track to use so you need to know where to put your car and which lines to take.


""The first session was pretty good and then the second one was ok but I know which direction I want to go in.


""My best time got deleted for track limits. My other lap was ok but I made a few mistakes so there’s room for improvement on my side in terms of driving and also getting the most out of the tyres.""
