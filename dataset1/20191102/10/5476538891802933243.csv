“Sports and athletes like Alexander Kurlovich unite.” Chairman of the Oblast Executive Committee Vladimir Kravtsov met with representatives of the International Weightlifting Federation
02 Nov 2019, 10:38 by Victor MOKHAN
Already today, Grodno is hosting a tournament equal to the world championship in terms of organization and invited athletes.
This, of course, is about the memory cup of Alexander Kurlovich, which this year also became one of the selection stages for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
A few hours before the opening of the sports festival, the chairman of the regional executive committee Vladimir Kravtsov, deputy chairman of the regional executive committee Viktor Liskovich and the head of the sports and tourism department of the regional executive committee Oleg Andreychik met with representatives of the international and Belarusian weightlifting federations. Among the guests of honor were Mohammed Al-Shammari, Secretary General of the International Weightlifting Federation and Niku Vlad, Vice President of the International Weightlifting Federation and Head of the Technical Committee. The Belarusian side was represented by Mikhail Rabikovsky and Sergey Samusev, chairman and general secretary of the Belarusian Weightlifting Union public association.






During the meeting, Vladimir Kravtsov noted the rich traditions of the Grodno region in weightlifting and expressed the hope that such tournaments will help to nurture new famous weightlifters.



- Our region is famous for high-profile sports achievements and famous athletes, but weightlifting is given a special place. Sport is moved by people, and thanks to the outstanding athlete Alexander Kurlovich, this particular type began to develop from the 80s of the last century. After Alexander’s victories at the Olympics, a lot of young people came to the weightlifting section. Now, even in new schools for one thousand students, there are halls where young talents can be engaged, ”Vladimir Kravtsov emphasized. - Almost every national championship is held in Grodno, and this is very important, since we have a base for holding high-level tournaments. I thank the international weightlifting federation for the confidence and opportunity to hold the memory cup of Alexander Kurlovich in his small homeland. We hope that this is not the last international weightlifting tournament, that the federation will come here more often. This will guarantee that we will have a new Kurlovich.



It is gratifying to realize that the International Weightlifting Federation plans to leave this tournament in the calendar of major competitions for weightlifters. Mohammed Al-Shammari confirmed these intentions:

- I know that weightlifting has a special place in Belarus: in almost every significant competition your team has won many awards. The Weightlifting Federation will provide all kinds of support so that in the future these competitions will be held at the same high level. Alexander Kurlovich is a weightlifting legend, the whole world knows and remembers the famous athlete, so there definitely is a memory cup.

Alexander Kurlovich devoted weightlifting his whole life: first as an athlete, then as a coach and judge. Weightlifters around the world remember him and honor him. Niku Vlad once competed with him on the same platform, repeatedly competing in the European and World Championships for gold medals. However, in ordinary life, colleagues in the workshop were close friends, and the head of the technical committee did not hide his emotions, recalling the outstanding athlete:




- I am very glad that I was able to come to Belarus, to the homeland of Alexander Kurlovich. I knew him for 30 years, we competed with each other in many competitions, and were friends outside the platform. I am very pleased that many friends of Alexander from all over the world came to this tournament. I would like to thank both the International Weightlifting Federation and the Belarusian Federation for organizing the Kurlovich memory cup. Once again, we made sure that sports and athletes such as Alexander unite us all.







The memory cup of Alexander Kurlovich will go on for three days. Among the participants are such eminent athletes as the Georgian Lasha Talakhadze - holder of three current world records in jerk, jerk and biathlon in the category of over 109 kilograms, Armenian Gor Minasyan - silver medalist of the 2016 Olympics, Chinese Yuan Chengfei - Asian champion of the last two years. Belarus will be represented by the best weightlifters of the republic: Yevgeny Tikhontsov - reigning world champion, Gennady Laptev - reigning European champion, Andrei Aryamnov - 2008 Olympic champion, silver medalist at the latest world and European championships. Vadim Likhorad from Lida, the bronze medalist of the 2018 World Cup and the bronze medalist of the European Championship 2019, will also be a candidate for the license. Among women, the fight for medals will be fought by Daria Naumova, silver medalist at the 2016 Olympics.
