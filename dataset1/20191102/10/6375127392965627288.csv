Ogie tagumpay kahit high school graduate lang
02 Nov 2019, 10:02 by Aster Amoyo
NATUTUWA kami sa narating ng isa nating kasamahan sa panulat bilang entertainment writer-turned actor-comedian, radio anchor,  talent manager-host  and lately bilang isang movie producer na si Roger Diaz Pandaan na mas kilala as Ogie Diaz.
Malayo na talaga ang narating ng high school graduate ng Victorino Mapa High School ng San Miguel at pang-anim sa walong magkakapatid.
“Even as a kid, gusto ko lang makatulong sa pamilya ko,” pahayag ni Ogie na pinasok na rin ang pagiging movie producer sa pamamagitan ng pelikulang “Two Love You” na tinatampukan nina Yen Santos, Kid Yambao, Reginald Lassy Marquez, Arlene Muhlach at iba pa na dinirek ni Benedict Mique.  Ito’y mula sa magkakatulong na panulat nina Ogie Diaz, Carlo Ventura at ni Benedict Mique at nakatakdang ipalabas thru Viva Films  ngayong November 13, araw ng Miyerkules.
Bakit hindi ang alaga niyang si Liza Soberano ang kinuha niyang pangunahing bida sa first attempt niya bilang movie producer?
“Sobra nang napakalaking artista ni Liza,” aniya.  “Ayoko pating sabihin niya na nagti-take advantage ako sa kanya dahil alaga ko siya,” katwiran niya.
“Maybe someday kapag kaya ko na ang talent fee niya,” natatawang pahayag ni Ogie.
Ang tagumpay ngayon ni Ogie ay dahil na rin sa matagal niyang panahong pagtitiyaga at masipag sa trabayo.
“Nagsimula ako bilang alalay ni Tita Cristy (Fermin), then natuto akong magsulat sa mga magasin niya noon, naging editor, naging entertainment writer/columnist, then actor-comedian, entertainment radio anchor hanggang matutunan ko na rin ang pagiging isang talent manager,” kuwento pa niya.
“Hindi po ako nakapagtapos ng kolehiyo.  Umabot lamang po ako ng  first year college na hindi ko pa natapos ang first sem” patuloy niya.
Habang unti-unti nang gumaganda ang kita ni Ogie ay natulungan niya ang kanyang pamilya maging ang pagpapaaral sa dalawa niyang nakababatang kapatid.
Kilala si Ogie sa pagiging open gay pero hindi ito naging sagabal sa kanyang pagkakaroon ng sariling pamilya.  He has a supportive wife of 19 years na si Georgette del Rosario at meron na silang limang anak na lahat babae, the eldest of whom ay 18 na at ang bunso naman ay 2-1/2.
Ogie is a good provider sa kanyang pamilya na ang kanyang ultimate goal ay mabigyan ng magandang buhay ang mga ito.
“Kaya ako sobrang nagsisikap sa buhay ay dahil sa pamilya ko lalung-lalo na sa mga anak ko,” pagtatapos niya.

Ogie success even high school graduate
02 Nov 2019, 10:02 by Aster Amoyo
We are delighted to hear from our fellow writers as entertainment writer-turned actor-comedian, radio anchor, talent manager-host and lately as a movie producer Roger Diaz Pandaan better known as Ogie Diaz.
The high school graduate of Victorino Mapa High School in San Miguel and six of the eight siblings are within walking distance.
""Even as a kid, I just want to help my family,"" said Ogie, who is also a movie producer with the movie ""Two Love You"" starring Yen Santos, Kid Yambao, Reginald Lassy Marquez, Arlene Muhlach and others directed by Benedict Mique. This is from collaborative writing by Ogie Diaz, Carlo Ventura and Benedict Mique and is set to release thru Viva Films this November 13, Wednesday.
Why didn't her caregiver Liza Soberano take the lead in her first attempt as a movie producer?
“Liza's an incredible actress,” she said. ""I don't want him to say that I'm taking advantage of him because I take care of him,"" he reasoned.
""Maybe someday when I can afford his talent,"" Ogie laughed.
Ogie's success today is due to his long-standing perseverance and hard work.
“I started as an aunt of Tita Cristy (Fermin), then I learned to write in her magazines, became an editor, entertainment writer / columnist, then actor-comedian, entertainment radio anchor until I learned how to become a talent manager, ”He said.
“I didn't even finish college. I just reached first year college and I didn't finish the first sem ”he continued.
As Ogie's income continued to improve, she helped her family become educated by her two younger siblings.
Ogie is known for being open gay but has never been a hindrance to having a family of his own. He has a supportive wife of 19 years Georgette del Rosario and they have five daughters, the eldest of whom is 18 and the youngest is 2-1 / 2.
Ogie is a good provider to her family whose ultimate goal is to give them a good life.
“So I try so hard to make a living because of my family and especially my children,” she concluded.
