（中央社記者戴雅真倫敦2日專電）英國艾塞克斯郡10月23日發生冷凍貨櫃藏有39具遺體命案震驚全國，死者身分一度傳出為中國人，英國警方持續追查後，現在已經證實全部都為越南籍。
被英國媒體稱為「鐵棺材」的冷凍貨櫃由比利時濟布魯治（Zeebrugge）港口出發，跨海抵達英國艾塞克斯（Essex）的泰晤士河港口柏佛利特（Purfleet），10月23日凌晨被司機發現貨櫃內的屍體後報警，死者為31男8女。司機羅賓森（Maurice Robinson）被控過失殺人及共謀販運人口。
由於受害者攜帶的身分證件稀少，辨識身分不易，一度傳出死者全為中國籍，但後來發現可能是越南籍人士使用偽造的中國護照。
英國警方持續追查後證實，39名死者全部來自越南。
英國廣播公司（BBC）報導，艾塞克斯郡警方表示，已經直接聯絡上部分死者在英國或越南的家屬，也和越南政府有聯繫。
助理警察局長史密斯（Tim Smith）表示：「現階段我們認為所有受害者都是越南公民，並和越南政府保持密切聯繫。」但他表示，目前無法證實任何一名受害者的身分。
冷凍貨櫃命案傳出後，不少越南家屬憂心死者可能是自己的親屬，紛紛通報。
39名死者仍在進行驗屍，以辨明死因。
越南駐倫敦使館對這起事件表示哀痛，並對受害者家屬致上誠摯哀悼。使館指出：「受害者的確切身分仍須進一步證實，並由在越南或英國的家屬確認。」
事件爆發後，越南嚴查人蛇仲介偷渡，河靜省（Ha Tinh）已有兩人因相關罪名遭到起訴。（編輯：林憬屏）1081102
