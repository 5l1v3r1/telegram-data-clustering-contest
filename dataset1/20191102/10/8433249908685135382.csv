HONG KONG (AP) - The Latest on protests in Hong Kong (all times local):
6:50 p.m.
Protesters have vandalized the Hong Kong office of China's official Xinhua News Agency for the first time during the months-long anti-government demonstrations, smashing windows and doors.
Local media showed scenes of the aftermath that included a fire in the lobby of the Xinhua office in Hong Kong's Wan Chai district, with shattered windows and graffiti sprawled over the wall. It was unclear if there were people in the building.
Protesters have been targeting Chinese banks and businesses perceived to be linked to mainland China as anger builds up against Beijing, which the protesters accuse of infringing on the freedoms guaranteed when Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997.
Earlier Saturday, police fired tear gas and a water cannon in the area after some protesters hurled gasoline bombs at them in another weekend of chaos.

4 p.m.
Defying a police ban, thousands of black-clad masked protesters are streaming into Hong Kong's central shopping district for another rally demanding a meaningful autonomy after Beijing indicated it could tighten its grip on the territory.
The protests began in June over a now-shelved plan to allow extraditions to mainland China but have since swelled into a movement seeking direct elections for Hong Kong's leaders as the city was promised it when Britain returned it to China in 1997.
Scores of protesters occupied streets at the upscale Causeway Bay shopping area Saturday, chanting pro-democracy slogans. Another big crowd has converged at the nearby Victoria Park.
Riot police conducted searches and issued warnings that the rally was illegal and protesters violating a government ban on masks.

From cultivated gangster hand
Justice auctioned seized Gold Benz
Buyers are not allowed to pay in cash
02 Nov 2019, 10:00 by PETER POENSGEN
Düsseldorf - Since the Oberfinanzdirektion has a very special goldfish on the hook: Next week, a ""golden"" Daimler SLS AMG will be auctioned in Düsseldorf, which was seized in a raid against a Hagen gambling clan in the fall of 2018.
The golden Coupé has the number 20 in the auction catalog and the addition: ""It concerns a vehicle drawn up by the tax authorities!"" The minimum bid: 72 000 euros.
The bolide is classified as ""ready to drive"". Bad luck for the new owner: He must first with the part to TÜV (""HU: due""). Who wants to win the contract must know: You can pay only with EC or credit card. This is to prevent that Strohmänner secretly buy back the vehicle with cash for the clan.


Thus, the Daimler SLS AMG is listed in the auction catalog of the Oberfinanzdirektion

Also on offer: a green Daimler ""AMG GT R"" (from 66 800 euros), also from the raid in Hagen. At the beginning of October, two Clan Lamborghinis had already come for about 400 000 euros under the hammer.

It is the official direction of the judiciary in North Rhine-Westphalia to make life as hard as possible for criminal gangs - including through the seizure of luxury items, high-horsepower cars, Nobel watches and other ""inexplicable assets"". The auction runs on 6 November (9.30 clock), Königsberger Straße 100, in Dusseldorf-Lierenfeld.
