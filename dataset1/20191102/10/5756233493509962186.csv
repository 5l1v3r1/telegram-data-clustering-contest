Danna Paola es una de las celebridades hispanas más seguidas a nivel global, y eso se debe a su rol protagónico en la serie de Netflix, ‘Élite’, pero también por su peculiar estilo de moda.



En su cuenta de Instagram, la actriz y cantante publica fotos de sus creativos outfits, que además de representar su estilo personal, están en plena tendencia. Además, nos sirven como fuente de inspiración para recrearlos en caso.



Recientemente, vimos a Danna Paola luciendo un outfit ‘trendy’, ideal para las bajitas debido a su corte (que más los tacones le da piernas kilométricas) y que tú también puedes usar para una fiesta o evento formal. Se trató de un vestido mini metálico con acabado de lentejuelas plateadas del diseñador mexicano, Alfredo Martínez.



Para combinar el vestido (y añadir un poco de color) la actriz llevó unos tacones verdes con detalles brillosos de Manolo Blahnik y accesorios hechos de oro blanco y esmeraldas.



Así que ya lo sabes wapa, anímate a usar un vestido metálico para un look perfecto para la noche o un evento importante, y al estilo de Danna Paola, combínalo con algún detalle de color.

The dollar fell behind

02 Nov 2019, 10:22


The US dollar fell against many of its counterparts as the third consecutive interest rate decline in the US.


Sunshine News:

The last day of weekly trading in the foreign exchange markets was once again heavily influenced by news of Britain's exit from the EU and lower interest rates in the US. Although the US dollar rose at the start of the trading session last month due to relatively good job creation, the US central bank officials' stance on the possibility of further interest rate cuts stalled the trend.
Sean Osborne, chief currency strategist at Bank of Scotland, said the job market data was much better than expected as general strikes at General Motors were expected to seriously disrupt the job creation process, according to Reuters. However, the trend of slowing economic growth is expected to continue for the time being.
Another factor in the depreciation of the dollar was the third negative growth in the manufacturing sector in October. The US dollar index, which measures the exchange rate against a basket of world currencies, closed down 4.3 percent to settle at 0.5 points. The Swiss franc equaled $ 4.3.
In the electorate, too, after a long struggle, its parliament has finally agreed to the government's call for early elections. The December 12th parliamentary elections, also considered the first British parliamentary elections in December in a century, will probably end three years of controversy over the election issue. The European Union has also sent a letter to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying that it has decided to extend the deadline for Britain to leave the EU by the end of January next year.
In today's trading, the pound traded slightly higher than the previous day's trading at $ 2.9. The euro also rose to $ 0.9 a barrel to close the recession after a long run.
""Traders are looking for a clearer Federal Reserve position on the monetary policy outlook,"" said Samomito Mitsui, currency strategist at Mitsui DS Management. The central bank is likely to refrain from behavior that will cause the markets to become overly excited, and we will not see a significant shift in federal reserve policy until we see a really big risk.
Also, on the last day of the weekly trading, the US dollar rose to $ 4.10 per Canadian dollar. In exchange for the Singapore counterpart, the dollar was traded at Singapore's dollar at $ 2.9.
In the global currency markets, the dollar also fell slightly to about 1.5 yen per dollar. Against the Australian counterpart, the US dollar was traded at $ 1.5. Also, the Chinese dollar equivalence rate was announced at 1.5 yuan.
