      <p>Father Tom Connery, 82, a longtime priest of the Diocese of Albany, died after being swept away in flash foods on Thursday, according to a statement from New York State Police.</p>
      <p>Connery was driving through a roadway in the town of Norway that had already overflowed and was still getting pummeled with flooding, the statement read.</p>

      <p>Connery's 2017 Ford Fusion struggled to make it through, a witness told police, and became stuck after part of the road collapsed on the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Connery got out of the car and tried to walk through the floodwaters to reach the witness, but lost his footing and "was washed downstream," police said.</p>
      <p>"Due to the dangerously high and strong current, the witness was unable to help Mr. Connery," the statement continued.</p>
      <p>Crews searched for Connery early Friday after the flood waters had receded. They found his body about a quarter-mile downstream, police said.</p>

      <p>The storm battered the Eastern part of the country and brought 5 inches of rain to central New York. It resulted in a flash flood emergency for parts of Herkimer County, where Connery's vehicle became trapped.</p>
      <p>Connery had been serving as a priest for 56 years, said Bishop Edward B. Scharfenberger.</p>
      <p>"We are so saddened to learn of Father Thomas Connery’s tragic death, but we know that he died as he lived -- serving the people of God without fear or concern for himself,” the bishop said in a statement to <a href="https://www.evangelist.org/Content/Default/Homepage-Rotator/Article/FATHER-CONNERY-TRAGICALLY-KILLED/-3/141/27870?fbclid=IwAR35YiMDrgP51FHyA7iSQwG13MhqWK9lpcExXUDCNIypSJn6snXVOgqy3o4">The Evangelist</a>, the publication of the Diocese of Albany.</p>
      <p>In Tennessee, another man died in the storm, according to the Knoxville Police Department.</p>
      <p>George Walker, 79, was in his car Thursday when a large tree fell onto his vehicle. He was rushed to the University of Tennessee Medical Center, and where he died a short time later, police said.</p>
