French Students Will Now Have to Learn About Bitcoin
02 Nov 2019, 10:00 by Jennings Brown
High school students in France may be among the first people in the world to actually understand how cryptocurrency works.
The Next Web reports that the French education ministry, Le Ministère de l’Éducation Nationale, will integrate cryptocurrency into its curriculum and teach students the influence that bitcoin has on the economy. An outline of the curriculum notes that under this new module, high school teachers will provide a basic overview of cryptocurrency so students can understand the framework of decentralised financial systems.
France announced the decision in June, but cryptocurrency reporters in the U.S. and France have learned of the new curriculum this week.
The education ministry recommends teachers use four educational videos that address questions like “Is Bitcoin the currency of the future?” and “Can Bitcoin replace the Euro?”
According to the cryptocurrency outlet Decrypt, the curriculum outline advises that students should watch the videos and discuss the differences between fiat money (like the pound coins in your wallet) and bitcoin.
This is far from the first time academic institutions will be encouraged to teach students about cryptocurrency. A recent Coinbase report found that 42 per cent of top universities feature blockchain and cryptocurrency course. But France’s new suggested curriculum is likely the first nationwide programme that encourages blockchain studies.
No matter how you feel about cryptocurrency, encouraging young students to understand financial systems can only benefit them and the future economy. If recent generations of students had a healthy balance of STEM and economics in their curriculum, we wouldn’t be as screwed as we are now.

GWINNETT COUNTY, Ga. - An attempted robbery at a Gwinnett County gas station didn’t exactly go as planned, police said.

Authorities said 19-year-old Jalen Bridgewaters tried to rob a Shell station on Satellite Boulevard on Oct. 21 when the clerk snatched his gun from underneath the partition and refused to give it back.
The Duluth man is one of three people charged in a string of armed robberies at Gwinnett businesses, Gwinnett police Cpl. Wilbert Rundles said Friday.
Instead of leaving the gas station after the gun was ripped from his hands, Bridgewaters allegedly pleaded with the clerk to give it back, authorities said.
He first demanded the firearm, Rundles said, telling the Shell employee he’d come back and shoot him if he didn’t return the weapon. When that failed, Bridgewaters allegedly changed his tune, telling the clerk he would leave the shop without robbing it if he could just get his gun back. 
He eventually left the store empty-handed, but by then, police had arrived. 
Authorities said they were able to link Bridgewaters to five other robberies, three that occurred Oct. 6 and three that took place Oct. 21.
Police also charged two Norcross men — 22-year-old Emmanuel Craig and 18-year-old Nicholas Abreu — in connection with the heists.
Most of the robberies took place in unincorporated Gwinnett, but one occurred in Lilburn and one in Duluth, police said. Authorities believe Craig was an accomplice to the Oct. 21 incidents while Abreu took part in the ones that occurred two weeks earlier, Rundles said.
Bridgewaters faces six counts of armed robbery, five counts of aggravated assault and four counts of false imprisonment. Craig faces two counts of armed robbery and one count of probation violation, and Abreu is charged with two counts of armed robbery, Gwinnett County jail records show.
All three remain held without bond. 
Anyone with additional information is asked to contact Gwinnett detectives at 770-513-5300. Tipsters wishing to remain anonymous are asked to call Crime Stoppers at 404-577-8477 or visit the website.
