      <p>North Korea has carried out a "successful" new test of its "super-large multiple rocket launcher" system, state media said on Friday - the latest in a series of provocations by Pyongyang.</p>
      <p>South Korea's military said on Thursday that the North had launched two short-range projectiles from South Pyongan province. They each flew approximately 370km.</p>

      <p>It was the latest in a series of launches by the North but the first since October 2, when it fired a sea-launched missile.</p>
      <p>If confirmed, a submarine-based missile capability would change the military balance on the Korean peninsula.</p>
      <p>Thursday's test was conducted to "verify the security of launchers' continuous fire system", the state Korean Central News Agency reported from Pyongyang.</p>

      </p>
      <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who had personally supervised previous tests of the "super-large" system, "expressed satisfaction... and sent congratulations" to the team involved, KCNA said.</p>
      <p>Nuclear talks between Pyongyang and Washington are currently at a standstill.</p>
      <p>Pyongyang is under multiple sets of international sanctions over its nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programmes, which it says it needs to defend against a possible US invasion.</p>
      <p>It is demanding the easing of the measures and has repeatedly urged Washington to come forward with a new offer by the end of this year.</p>
      <p>Kim and US President Donald Trump adopted a vaguely-worded statement on the "complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula" at their first summit in Singapore in June last year, but little progress has since been made.</p>
      <p>The pair met in Hanoi in February, but no deal was reached.</p>
      <p>Trump and Kim then agreed to restart working-level talks during a brief meeting at the Demilitarised Zone dividing the peninsula in June.</p>
      <p>The two sides met in Sweden earlier this month but Pyongyang walked away, saying it had "no desire" to negotiate unless the US moves to end its "hostile policies".</p>
