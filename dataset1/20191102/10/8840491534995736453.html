      <p>COURT cases in Mayo are increasingly facing the threat of delays due to potential backlogs in the Probation Service.</p>
      <p>The issue was highlighted at a District Court sitting in Castlebar where the probation officer, in a matter that was adjourned for a report, indicated that the case had not yet been assigned due to a backlog of cases.</p>
      <p>A three-month time period has traditionally been given for the production of reports.</p>
      <p>It was indicated to Judge Fiona Lydon that the workload on probation officers has increased, while a colleague being on long-term leave was also having an impact.</p>
      <p>There were also a number of high risk cases coming in, which have to be prioritised.</p>
      <p>In the case in question, the judge said she was concerned as it involved a feud.</p>
      <p>There are two probation officers based in Co. Mayo and they receive some assistance from the Sligo office.</p>
      <p>The increased workload nationally is shown in the monthly offenders case-load reports published by the Probation Service. This month (October), in the west and north west region (Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim, Longford, Roscommon, Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal and Westmeath), the case-load is 1,667 offenders. That's up from 1,333 for the same month last year, with similar numbers in 2017 (1,313) and '16 (1,228).</p>
      <p>Prosecutions have been increasing.</p>
      <p>The Department of Justice press office, in a statement, said the Sligo/Mayo Probation Service team is currently managing in excess of 300 cases.</p>
      <p>At all times the team strives to deliver a high quality professional service to the courts and other stakeholders. As a demand-led service, it may happen that the demand for service temporarily outweighs capacity to deliver from time-to-time.</p>
      <p>In such instances the Probation Service works closely with the court to identify priorities, including targeting resources as a priority to moderate and higher risk offenders, where their work can have greatest effect in contributing to community safety through working with the offender to change his or her behaviour.</p>
