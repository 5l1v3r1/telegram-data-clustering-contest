Caspian Water Transfer - A Plan At Pinnacle of Power / Opposition that agreed overnight!
Flying collars over the opinions of all experts;

02 Nov 2019, 10:02

The strange surprise came from the complete silence of the authorities, and in particular the political governor of Mazandaran, who did not oppose and blamed the defense of the rights of the people of the north, especially Mazandaran, in political solidarity with Mr Rouhani and the reform movement.
It is true that in the tens and hundreds of bills and plans submitted to the Majlis, a percentage of these bills and plans may fall into error, but the reason for scrutiny by the relevant committees and hammermen is Expertise and utilizing the opinions of experts and senior experts reduces the error coefficient to the minimum possible, and beyond that when it is raised in the open court of the House of Representatives and after reviewing the views of dissenters, it may be possible to pass or reject that bill and plan of faith. The project is sponsored by the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Mannan, after undergoing various undergraduate courses, and its completion by national experts and the fierce opposition of the country's environmentalists, despite intense political lobbying by the two current and former governments, in which both heads of state are determined to enforce it in favor of their province. The case was rejected by the Islamic Consultative Assembly and its case was permanently archived, which was announced during a visit last year by Mr. Rouhani to his province and city and in a speech to the people of Semnan province that the Caspian Sea Water Transfer Plan was announced. Semnan will certainly be executed. Opponents who agreed overnight to declare illegal Mr. Rouhani, the government's deputy head of the environment, who is also the vice president, went on a mild slant to endorse Rouhani's opinion and was given a silent light on the preparations for the implementation of an illegal plan to transfer Caspian sea water to Semnan province. It is complete responsibility of the authorities, and in particular the political governor of Mazandaran, who did not oppose and blamed the defense of the rights of the people of the north, especially Mazandaran, in political solidarity with Mr Rouhani and the reform movement.
Caspian Sea Water Transmission The deadly catastrophe that has been rattling the northern provincial ecosystem has long been buzzed with and repeatedly met with fierce opposition from environmental experts. Caspian Sea Transfer not only in economic justification but also in economic justification. The widespread destruction of the Caspian forest ecosystem will result, with few but effective supporters who, despite all opposition, recently endorsed the ESA's endorsement and engraved a deadly tragedy on the Caspian forehead. Due to environmental conditions in most parts of our country But the Caspian Sea Water Transfer is one of the most controversial plans to conceal its Caspian oppression these days, a buried plan that should have gone to history, but with the presence of two presidents from Semnan province each time out of government. Caspian Sea Water Transmission, a fully-fledged Caspian Sea water transfer plan to Semnan, caused environmental changes including environmental pollution due to industrial use, agricultural development and destruction of biodiversity, as well as the introduction of invasive species such as plants and plants. The fish will head to the central plateau In different countries, not only economically expensive water transmission schemes, but also heavy social and environmental costs for both the sending and receiving points, and all international and domestic experience show that inter-basin water transmission projects. , Are unstable methods that have not only solved the problems, but have aggravated the water situation. Before turning to the high-risk water strategy implementation plan, officials first appear to have other possible alternatives, including water demand management solutions including water reclamation, aqueduct dredging, and the revival of traditional water supply and management practices, Land use management, attention to the issue of water in population growth policies, especially migration issues, and attention to the issue of water in industrial development. Even the economic part of the Caspian freshwater transfer plan is one of those projects in Semnan. This is in the face of serious opposition from economic activists Right. The most important issue raised by economists is how to consume Caspian water with energy, drill a 5-kilometer steel pipe, set up five pumping stations and five balancing stations along the way and provide Semnan with affordable water. ? The project's employer, the Iran Water and Power Resources Development Company, claims that the project is economical. This high-profile project must pass through the heart of the rainforest and, despite the use of two-meter-wide pipes, will certainly excavate a large volume of excavators. The astronomical figures that will lead to the destruction of more than 4,000 aras and more than 26,000 hirecan trees should be read as a conquest of our historic heritage, according to the Forestry Association. To destroy high quality forest soil, affecting the ecosystem of a disaster-stricken area of Khu Destruction of at least 100 hectares of former Hirkanimseol forests by the EPA says: Of the 180 kilometers that Caspian water is supposed to reach Semnan, 140 kilometers is located in Mazandaran province; water is transported 140 kilometers from Mazandaran province. As Mr Nassir Ahmadi, the head of the Mazandaran Maritime Department, has estimated, it will destroy at least 100 hectares of forested hills, but how much can hircans be able to ignore for another 100 hectares? With a simple screening of the victims of the project. The politicized will understand a plan that is not economically viable Of course, seven times to be taken into consideration last month was the issue of the transfer of water from the Caspian Sea to the central plateau of the country, as one of the most controversial issues. Reasons for MPs to impeach Reza Ardakanian - Minister of Energy. Below are seven points about the Caspian's water transfer plan to the country's central plateau.
1) The issue of Caspian Sea water transfer to Semnan was first raised in the Ninth Government for the first time, but was delayed until the twelfth government until President Hassan Rouhani announced last year that the government was fully prepared for the transfer. It has Caspian water. At the same time, the Environmental Protection Agency deemed the action unacceptable if it complied with environmental standards.
2) On October 1, 2009, Isa Kalantari - head of the Environmental Protection Agency - issued a letter to the Minister of Energy announcing the organization's agreement to transfer Caspian water. The sheriff's action sparked a backlash from parliament, Mazandaran province's natural resources and environmental experts.
2) Natural Resources of Mazandaran Province Following this action, the Technical Committee of the Directorate General of Natural Resources of the Province, in a letter to the EPA, opposed the transfer of water from the Caspian Sea to the central plateau of the Caspian Sea through a four-point clause. However, the EPA said in response to the statement that natural resources had not expressed opposition to Caspian water transfer.
2) According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the water pipeline is to be constructed via the Rey-Neka oil pipeline, but natural resources believe it is more than 5km from the proposed pipeline to pass through Hyrcanian forests if implemented. The project has a lot of damage to the forest.
2) Other concerns of natural resources are that the water transfer excavator will cause the loss of rich forest soils, and on the other hand, saline and wastewater from the desalination of water can be a problem for the Caspian Sea as well as the supply of electricity to pumping stations in forests. Hirkani is seriously hurt.
3) With these points in mind, Abdulreza Karbassi, a former deputy marine environmentalist at the Environment Agency, believes there are more cost-effective ways to tackle dehydration in different parts of the country, because in the agricultural sector alone, at least 2 billion cubic meters of water per year. It is economical. Therefore, it is not necessary to resort to expensive methods of fresh water supply.
1) Although the EPA has agreed to the water transfer, the Secretary of Energy says that what has happened these days is neither plan approval, opposition to the plan, nor conditional approval, nor re-examination of the plan. At the origin and destination of the catastrophe we see this bitter catastrophe on every side of the coin, it will be catastrophic; if the destination is to sweeten it, the soil will become saltier and more desolate, and if done at the origin, it will destroy all aquatic life. Damvand Gotvand, Zayandehrood, Orumiyeh and ... are the familiar names that have been tragedy in recent years under the mistreatment of government officials. Became painful; some for business and some for the palate Bhrhvryhay achieve in politics, we are destroying our international heritage Knnd.anthay message /
