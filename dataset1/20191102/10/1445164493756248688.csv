Preures : bientôt un préau tout neuf pour l’école!
02 Nov 2019, 10:13 by Le Journal du Montreuil

Le préau de l’école qui accueille les maternelles du RPI des Baillons montrait des signes de faiblesses depuis plusieurs années, d’où la décision de la municipalité d’en construire un nouveau.

Les élus ont donc troqué leurs écharpes contre pelles, pioches et bien sûr matériel plus performant de type grue et bulldozer pour raser le bâtiment existant, le tout en un temps record (une journée) ! La place laissée vide par ces travaux sera vite comblée puisqu’une structure en bois, made in Preures par les Ets Goudalle, est installée les vacances.
