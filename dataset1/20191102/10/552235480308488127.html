      <h1>Lazio star Ciro Immobile in Celtic vow as he lifts lid on his major Jurgen Klopp failure</h1>
      <h2>The Italy forward is just one short for a century of goals for Lazio and has the Hoops in his sights.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T10:27:30+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 10:27</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Walker</a></address>
      <p>Focused Lazio star Ciro Immobile reckons working with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> helped turn him into one of the world's deadliest strikers, ahead of this week's Europa League showdown with Celtic.</p>
      <p>The Italy forward is just one short for a century of goals for Lazio and will be hoping to reach the ton either on Sunday against AC Milan or on Thursday against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> .</p>
      <p>Immobile has been labelled the most in-form striker in the world just now by Lazio boss Simone Inzaghi having bagged 14 goals in 14 games this season for club and country.</p>
      <p>And the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lazio">Lazio</a> hero has credited his time working with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> boss Klopp - who splashed out £14 million to sign him for Borussia Dortmund five years ago - as key to turning him into a top striker.</p>

      <p>He said: "To be honest, my time at Dortmund wasn't a big success. I didn't settle well at the club and eventually moved on to Sevilla.</p>
      <p>"But I am forever grateful about it because it gave me the opportunity to work with Jurgen Klopp. If I didn't go to Germany, I would never have had a chance to work with him.</p>
      <p>"I believe that helped me enormously and when I eventually came back to Italy with Lazio three years ago I was a better player for the experience.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"I think I am going to be part of a success story at Lazio. We are in the hunt with three other teams for a Champions League place.</p>
      <p>"And we see the Europa League as very important now. It's actually a tournament that fascinates me. We are not in a good position and we absolutely must beat Celtic this week to get back in with a chance of qualification."</p>
