      <h2>Kimberley Davison, from Hebburn near Gateshead, says the constant budgeting and stress is now taking its toll on her mental health</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T10:24:36+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 10:24</time> by <a rel="author">Nicole Goodwin, Sam Truelove</a></address>
      <p>A nurse has claimed she skips meals to make sure her son does not go hungry after being left with just 44p a month to live off.</p>
      <p>Kimberley Davison, 30, works all of the hours she can in a bid to support her family but is still struggling to make ends meet.</p>
      <p>The constant budgeting and stress is now taking its toll on her mental health, the mum told <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/kimberley-davison-nurse-44p-live-17176557">Chronicle Live.</a></p>
      <p>"It’s like a fight to survive every month," she said.</p>
      <p>“I work all of the hours I can and do everything possible to support my family, but it’s still not enough.”</p>
      <p>The nurse, from Hebburn near Gateshead, does not work during the work, instead picking up shifts on weekends when she can.</p>
      <p>But even this source of work is unreliable with Kimberley working on a zero hour contract.</p>

      <p>The mum-of-one says she cannot afford any extra childcare, mainly because she lost her mum and stepdad to cancer while she was a student.</p>
      <p>She said: “It’s difficult to work during the week as I can only work half days and hospitals don’t really want those shifts.”</p>
      <p>Childcare is available through the Government, but Kimberley claims this would still not allow her to work a full 12-hour shift as the childcare is only offered between 7am and 6pm.</p>
      <p>Kimberley takes on weekend shifts when her son is with his dad, but this earns her on average £950 a month. This is not including the the £45 a week in Child Tax Credit she receives.</p>
      <p>Each month her outgoings include £400 rent, £89 council tax and £100 for gas and electricity. She also pays for her Royal College of Nursing union membership, TV licence, phone and credit card payments.</p>

      <p>The mum then has to fork out £45 for school meals and £18 for travel to and from work, leaving her with £60 a week to feed her family. </p>
      <p>In the past, Kimberly has had to use food banks after surviving a full weekend without sufficient food.</p>
      <p>“I especially struggle during the six weeks school holiday, it’s horrendous," she said.</p>
      <p>"The cost of food and new school uniform is so expensive.”</p>
      <p>Kimberly said she was heartbroken to realise her son had discovered she was struggling financially and watched her skip meals.</p>
      <p>She said: “A child shouldn’t need to worry about that. I thought I’d done enough to shield my family from my struggles."</p>
      <p>Kimberley has been visiting a ‘Grub Club’, which is ran by Hebburn Helps Community Foodbank during the school holidays, in a bid to relieve some of the financial stress.</p>
      <p>‘Grub Club’ is held at St Oswalds Church Hall, from 10am until 3pm outside of term time and provides meals and entertainment for families free of charge.</p>
      <p>Kimberley added: “Grub Club is a massive relief during the holidays.</p>
      <p>"There’s not much you can do with 44p, so this takes the pressure off me.”</p>
