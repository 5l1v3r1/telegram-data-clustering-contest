The Congress on Saturday hit out at the Centre over the snooping controversy, saying a ""dishonest"" government is refusing to answer key questions like who purchased and deployed the illegal spyware used for the alleged surveillance.
On Thursday, Facebook-owned company WhatsApp had said Indian journalists and human rights activists were among those globally spied upon by unnamed entities using Israeli spyware Pegasus, leading to a furore over breach of citizens' privacy.
Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala attacked the government saying that in May, WhatsApp had ""quickly resolved a security issue and notified relevant Indian and international government authorities"".
