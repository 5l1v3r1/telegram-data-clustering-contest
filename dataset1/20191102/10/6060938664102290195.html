      <p>ANTIGUA: The Indian eves may have lost their first ODI against the West Indies by a run, but star batswoman <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Harmanpreet-Kaur">Harmanpreet Kaur</a>, who is among the finest fielders in the women's game, won everyone's heart after coming up with a stunning catch in the contest.</p>
      <p>Harmanrpreet took a one-handed stunner at the long-on boundary at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium to dismiss West Indies captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Stafanie-Taylor">Stafanie Taylor</a>.</p>
      <p>When it seemed the ball would easily sail over the ropes for a six, which would have also resulted in a hundred for Taylor, Harmanpreet plucked the ball out of thin air with a brilliant jump timed to perfection.</p>

      <p>Electing to bat, West Indies put up a fighting total of 225/7, thanks to skipper Taylor's 94 and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Natasa-McLean">Natasa McLean</a>, who chipped in with 51. India were then bowled out for 224 off the final ball of the game, falling short by a run.</p>
      <p>Despite a brilliant half century from <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Priya-Punia">Priya Punia</a> (75), the Indian women failed to chase down 225.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, ace India opener <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Smriti-Mandhana">Smriti Mandhana</a>, who has successfully recovered from a toe injury she suffered during the home series against South Africa will join the team on November 3.</p>
      <p>Both the teams will now face-off in the second ODI on Sunday.</p>
