Лудогорец проявява сериозен интерес към крилото на Левски Станислав Иванов, твърди ""Тема Спорт"". Използвайки посредник, разградчани са разпитвали за цената на футболиста и са дали да се разбере, че са готови да платят милион евро за звездата на ""сините"". През настоящия сезон юношата на Левски е титуляр и вече реализира 6 гола.
Интерес за шампионите представлява и нападателят на столичани Найджъл Робърта. От Лудогорец се оглеждат за нов играч на върха на атаката, тъй като Клаудиу Кешеру не е първа младост, а Свиерчок доскоро дори не влизаше в групата при Станислав Генчев.
Вчера изпълнителният директор на ""сините"" Павел Колев разкри, че до този момент има запитвания само за Иванов. Наскоро младокът направи сравнение между Лудогорец и Левски. Вижте какво каза в този материал.

Survival Tips
02 Nov 2019, 10:42 by Luisa Pernalete

When I title SURVIVING in this way, with capital letters, it is because we are understanding it not how to crawl in the desert looking for water and ""survive"", but the sense of LIVING above the difficulties.




""I could give you 358 tips on how to face this country situation that is affecting us the most, but I have summarized them in 6,"" said the speaker, Dr. Edgar Benitez, a well-known psychiatrist in Barquisimeto. How to resist adversity, was the subtitle of his talk, part of the program of the Open Classroom to the Citizen, an initiative of the civil society Barquisimetana, already with 19 years of existence, which summons the last weekend of the month, to an activity It contributes to the training of citizens. The speakers cooperate without charge, the place provides it for free as a sign of the generosity of local entrepreneurs, and we all win.
I will share with you part of the content of the aforementioned conference, because I think it will be very useful.
“There is no day without a threat, without bad news, without abuse of our dignity. Every morning we have so many difficulties and obstacles that demand an amount of energy and effort that disrupt our daily lives and challenge our ability to healthy adaptation. Dr. Benitez told us. He recognized that he was also affected.
When I title SURVIVING, thus with a capital letter ABOUT it, it is because we are understanding it not how to crawl in the desert looking for water and survive, but the sense of LIVING above the difficulties. It is not about banalizing the issues, nor minimizing the seriousness of the country situation, but it is about not acting and feeling defeated in that situation.
And then, the 6 tips that Dr. Benítez offered to the attendees, all dotted with a lot of sense of humor.
1. Take care of your dream. The organism in general, and the brain in particular, requires that rest to recover energy. To do this, it is recommended to slow down the rhythms about half an hour before going to sleep: have an early dinner, turn off your cell phone, your tablet, your computer half an hour before bedtime.
2. Walk. Physical exercise, when done on a regular basis, brings multiple benefits to the body and to the mind. And I add, we all know that, but we don't always follow that good advice. From 20 to 30 minutes a day can help us sleep better, keep our brain better oxygenated. It's not about training for the New York marathon. And I remember that it is free, and does not require any card.
3. Be grateful. Thanks, stressed Dr. Benitez, assumes that one recognizes goodness in the other, and that attitude of humility is very positive. In this section he added that it was important to thank the possibility of doing something for others. I share that the people I know who do volunteer work, both in popular and middle class sectors, often say they receive much more than what they give. A friend, who had a severe depression, told me that she helped her volunteer in the solidarity pot of her parish.
4. Get together with others. Cultivating friendship is very important. Isolation is fatal to the brain, Benitez insisted. The next comment is mine. ""Alone we can not"", we usually say in the courses for Peace Promoting Mothers, alone we get tired quickly, alone we abandon causes. In addition, there are many good people in this country doing good things. Stick to them, share with them, listen to them.
5. Cultivate a healthy spirituality. That will help you to be a better person. And I complete that I have read that people who have faith, usually have more strength in adversity, raise their defenses against diseases, feel accompanied. It helps both to pray for others and to know that they pray for one.
6. Dream. He dreams of the seemingly impossible, he told us, and I add: dreams positively predispose the mind and our actions, encourage, are like a push towards the horizon we want. I think that stop dreaming is like accepting defeat, it's like ""dying slowly.""
Let me add the importance of knowing how to look with both eyes at the country: one to see the dramas, threats, sufferings of others, and with the other, to see the benefits of many people, to see the lights in the dark , see the generosity of many low profile people and see the dawn of each day. If you also know how to laugh at yourself, you have some tips, all free that depend on your decision to apply them.
Thanks to Dr. Benítez for his advice, and thanks to the Caroní Mail for allowing it to reach you.
