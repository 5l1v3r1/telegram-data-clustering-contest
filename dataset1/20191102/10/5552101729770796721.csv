02 Nov 2019, 10:17 by 梁欣喬
《盲人阿清》今（2日）舉辦府中15「聽．視界電影院」特映會，新北市文化局專門委員陳春美、公視總經理曹文傑、愛盲基金會副執行長劉怡君出席活動，導演薛朝輝、演員程予希、阮安妮及口述顧問老師李



在片中就飾演口述影像老師熊谷美雪的程予希表示，為了呈現影片有到愛盲基金會見習。也提到「因為角色是口述影像者，要更知道用不同方式說電影，真的要花很多時間去了解影片的切點、斷句，還不能蓋過影片旁白」，為了這下很大工夫拼命練習。程予希對於能實際體驗「聽電影」的活動感到相當開心，也表示確實能拉近與視障朋友們的距離，十分有意義。


程予希和導演薛朝輝 今日出席《盲人阿清》特映會。

程予希片中常牽著洪都拉斯走在路上，她也感謝洪都拉斯一起對戲的丟接球；也覺得「可以很不受限、自由地去跟洪都拉斯與北村豐晴一起表演，真的很棒」。愛盲基金會副執行長劉怡君也透露「在劇組安排下，程予希、洪都拉斯他們到基金會學正確的持杖跟『人導法』，跟著大家一起吃飯、瞭解視障者正常樣貌，真的是非常用心且用功的專業演員」。
阮安妮片中飾演少年阿清的戀人，當初接到以視障者觀點出發的戲劇也覺得是冥冥中的緣分，因為「我阿媽也經歷40多年的視障生活，但他們都很獨立的，也都希望不拖累自己的兒孫」。
今現場擔任口述影像老師的李曉卿出身廣播與兒童節目主持，也是《盲人阿清》的顧問，她說「口述影像其實比做廣播節目累很多，但每每週末下午在口述影像現場看見大風大雨都能看見視障者到場，珍惜『看電影、聽電影』的機會，都會讓人覺得很棒！這是為視障者服事的機會」；她也盛讚程予希用功的演員，「她領悟力很高，有幾個口述段落我提醒他一下後，接下來演出就很不一樣」。《盲人阿清》明（3日）晚10時於公視首播。
