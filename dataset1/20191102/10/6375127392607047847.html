      <h3>BEA Binene is thankful that GMA Kapuso Foundation tapped her to be their youth advocate in their Disaster Relief Program. “I will be participating in their Operation Bayanihan relief operations kapag may nagaganap na natural calamities like mga bagyo or earthquake and the like,” she says. “I want to spread awareness to the public the need to support such relief efforts so we can ensure immediate aid to our needy brothers and sisters. I’m really grateful to be part of this advocacy lalo na ngayong mas grabe na ang mga bagyo due to climate change.”</h3>
      <p>She says she’s been involved in such relief operations for a long time now. “On my own, tumutulong ako kapag may bagyo o may nasunugan,” she adds. “Since 5 or 6 years old, tumutulong na ako sa mother ko when she helps out sa disaster victims. Noong magkaroon ng war in Marawi, gusto kong sumama sa mga nagpunta roon para makatulong, kaya lang hindi ako pinayagan for my own safety raw. Ngayon, gusto ko ring makatulong sa victims ng recent earthquake sa Mindanao na nagsisiksikan daw sa evacuation centers.”</p>
      <p>Bea is actually so busy now taping for her current primetime show, “Beautiful Justice”. “Hand to mouth ang taping namin ngayon,” she says. “Kung minsan, what we tape today, for airing mamayang gabi. So laging apurahan ang paggawa namin ng bagong episodes.”</p>
      <p>They’re happy that their action-drama is gaining more followers. “The story is getting more exciting, lalo na 'yung love triangle involving Gabbi Garcia, Derrick Monasterio and Gil Cuerva. Si Yasmien Kurdi naman as Alice, nabilanggo dahil sa kagagawan ng mga kalaban namin pero nakalabas na siya at magkakaroon siya ng bagong manliligaw in Victor Neri. The episodes now will show how drug syndicates use car shows to smuggle drugs. Kunwari, bibili ka ng bagong kotse, pero 'yung kotseng bibilhin mo, puno na pala 'yun ng illegal drugs.”</p>
      <p>Bea is also deadset in her goal to be an entrepeneur. She’s now studying to be a chef at Cafe Ysabel’s culinary school in preparation for her goal to put up her own restaurant.</p>
