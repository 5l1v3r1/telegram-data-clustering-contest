Τα τρυφερά λόγια του ηθοποιού
Ήταν 1η Νοεμβρίου του 2017 όταν ο πατέρας του Γιάννη Σπαλιάρα έφυγε από τη ζωή.
Το πρώην μοντέλο και ηθοποιός είχε πολύ καλές σχέσεις με τον πατέρα του και έχει μιλήσει αρκετές φορές για το πόσο του στοίχισε ο θάνατος του.
Με αφορμή τη συμπλήρωση των τριών χρόνων από εκείνη τη τραγική ημέρα ο Γιάννης Σπαλιάρας ανέβασε δυο φωτογραφίες των γονιών του από το παρελθόν σε Insta Storie και έγραψε: «τρία χρόνια που έφυγες παλικάρι μου και είναι σαν χθες…σ’αγαπώ».

Ate Vi turns 66, wants to be with Luis
02 Nov 2019, 10:12 by Aster Amoyo
MULTI-AWARD winning actress, dancer-host-turned-politician Maria Rosa Vilma Tuazon Santos-Recto turns 66 today, November 3.
Vi's career spans more than five decades now since he made his first film in February 1963 when he was 9 years old, the ""Trudis Liit"" directed by Jose de Villa. Vi is joined by Connie Angeles and the late actors Lolita Rodriguez, Bella Flores, Charlie Davao, Rodolfo `Boy 'Garcia, Matimtiman Cruz, Ray Marcos and others.
Until Vi grew up she continued to be a great actress, dancer and TV host. She also co-starred with Edgar `Weight 'Mortiz who is now a TV director besides being an actor-comedian.
Drama King Christopher de Leon is Vi's most successful movie partner as they have made over 24 movies as a couple and all made it to the box office. But despite that, they were never linked to one another.
“Maybe because we both have different relationships when we're filming,” Boyet (Christopher) recalls.
When Vi married model-turned actor Edu Manzano in 1980, their marriage lasted only two years and ended in divorce when their only son, Luis Manzano was only a toddler. Sixteen years later, Vi remarried to young politician Ralph Recto (in 1998) and they were blessed with a son, Ryan Christian Santos Recto who is now 23 years old and expected to follow in the footsteps of his celebrity parents in field of politics. While Luis was an actor-comedian and most in-demand TV host he also inherited his popular parents. He is also a successful entrepreneur.
Vi has remained good friends with her ex-husband and Luis's father Edu up to now.
In the meantime, if Vi has a birthday wish on her birthday is for the good health and happiness of her family and loved ones and to see her children Luis and Christian happily married someday and having grandchildren these.
""But Luis first, don't be Christian first,"" said the Star for All Seasons and birthday girl Vi.
