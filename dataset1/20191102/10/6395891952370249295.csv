Unele modele vechi iPhone nu vor mai funcţiona din 3 noiembrie fără update
02 Nov 2019, 10:52 by Mihai Gongoroi
Anumite modele de iPhone şi iPad lansate în 2012 nu vor mai funcţiona corect începând de duminică, 3 noiembrie, în lipsa instalării unei actualizări de soft, transmite CNBC.
În mod special este vorba despre modelele iPhone 5 care nu au instalat update-ul iOS 10.3.4, acestea urmând să nu mai poată să se conecteze la servicii online care solicită informaţii despre oră şi data. Asta înseamnă că nu vor mai putea fi descărcate aplicaţii din magazinul virtual Apple, nu va fi posibilă accesarea mail-ului sau navigarea pe internet.
Ratarea termenului limită, respectiv ora 20:00 ora României în data de 3 noiembrie, va face imposibilă descărcarea automată a actualizării, astfel că posesorii modelelor în cauză vor trebui să-şi actualizeze aparatele prin intermediul unui computer.
Modelele iPhone 4 şi o serie de iPad-uri, respectiv Mini, iPad 2 şi iPad 3, vor avea nevoie şi ele de un update, anume iOS 9.3.6 sau nu vor mai fi capabile să asigure o locaţie GPS exactă şi în consecinţă o serie de servicii.
Update-ul este necesar ca urmare a atingerii unei limite de cod pentru sistemul de navigaţie GPS, care este urmată de o resetare a ""ceasului"" acestuia.
Aparatele pot fi actualizate manual din tabelul Setări → General.

HONG KONG (AP) - The Latest on protests in Hong Kong (all times local):
6:50 p.m.
Protesters have vandalized the Hong Kong office of China's official Xinhua News Agency for the first time during the months-long anti-government demonstrations, smashing windows and doors.
Local media showed scenes of the aftermath that included a fire in the lobby of the Xinhua office in Hong Kong's Wan Chai district, with shattered windows and graffiti sprawled over the wall. It was unclear if there were people in the building.
Protesters have been targeting Chinese banks and businesses perceived to be linked to mainland China as anger builds up against Beijing, which the protesters accuse of infringing on the freedoms guaranteed when Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997.
Earlier Saturday, police fired tear gas and a water cannon in the area after some protesters hurled gasoline bombs at them in another weekend of chaos.

4 p.m.
Defying a police ban, thousands of black-clad masked protesters are streaming into Hong Kong's central shopping district for another rally demanding a meaningful autonomy after Beijing indicated it could tighten its grip on the territory.
The protests began in June over a now-shelved plan to allow extraditions to mainland China but have since swelled into a movement seeking direct elections for Hong Kong's leaders as the city was promised it when Britain returned it to China in 1997.
Scores of protesters occupied streets at the upscale Causeway Bay shopping area Saturday, chanting pro-democracy slogans. Another big crowd has converged at the nearby Victoria Park.
Riot police conducted searches and issued warnings that the rally was illegal and protesters violating a government ban on masks.
