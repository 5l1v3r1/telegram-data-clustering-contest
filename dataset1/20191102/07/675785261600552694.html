      <h1>Owen Farrell's bumper salary makes England star one of world's highest-paid rugby players</h1>
      <h2>Farrell is one of the best paid players in the world and is seen as the face of the England national team</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T07:04:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 07:04</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/</a></address>
      <p>Owen Farrell's bumper deal that he signed in 2017 still makes him one of the highest-paid players in world rugby.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/england-rugby-union-team">England</a> star is the face of the national team and also Saracens, who have won two out of the last three European Champions Cups.</p>
      <p>As a result, he was able to sign a bumper contract to keep him at Sarries until 2022.</p>
      <p>The deal is believed to be worth just over £750,000 every season, which totals £3.75m over the five years of the contract.</p>
      <p>It means he is around the level of some of the top earners in the whole of rugby union.</p>

      <p>At the end of 2018, Australia star Israel Folau was the highest-earning in the world with £1.2m in annual wages.</p>
      <p>Despite his riches, Farrell enjoys a quiet life away from the pitch alongside his wife Georgie, who we married in the summer of 2018.</p>
      <p>The pair have enjoyed a long-term relationship and finally tied the knot one year after he got down on one knee.</p>
      <p>Farrell currently lives in a lavish Hertfordshire home alongside Georgie and their dog, Ron.</p>
