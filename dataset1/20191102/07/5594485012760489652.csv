OM : les 5 onze possibles pour Villas-Boas




L'Olympique de Marseille poursuit son calendrier infernal. Apr√®s le Paris Saint-Germain il y a une semaine, apr√®s l'AS Monaco il y a quelques jours en Coupe de la Ligue, et avant l'Olympique Lyonnais dans sept jours, les Phoc√©ens ont rendez-vous au Stade V√©lodrome avec Lille. Une tourn√©e des cadors du championnat qui a bien mal d√©but√© au Parc des Princes, les hommes d'Andr√© Villas-Boas √©tant balay√©s par Kylian Mbapp√© et les siens (0-4). Le PSG hors-cat√©gorie, l'OM a surtout l'occasion face aux Nordistes de recoller aux poursuivants. Large vainqueur de Bordeaux lors de la pr√©c√©dente journ√©e (3-0), le LOSC, troisi√®me, ne poss√®de effectivement que deux points d'avance sur son h√¥te, actuellement septi√®me de Ligue 1. Ce 12e √©pisode de la saison 2019/2020 pourrait donc s'av√©rer √™tre un tournant pour les deux formations, pour ce qui est l'un des chocs du championnat hexagonal.

OVENDEN will be filled with difficulties and your mood is not good. This is due to home issues that you will not be able to solve for the moment. You will be angered by some of your friends whose ideas for success in these problems are quite inapplicable. Today your workplace activity is diminished.VEALTHE lot of poisons will create professional problems for you today, but you should know that the way to solve them lies only in the calm approach. Most of you have problems with changes to the service. Do not talk to your employer because your contacts are doomed to failure. These zodiac signs are real angels! They penetrate with ease into the soul of people and take away all their pain! GEMINI Twins with great effort maintain a balance in their relations with others. But if there are contradictions or you feel somewhat dissatisfied with the attitude of others towards you, you should not take it to heart. Some of the difficulties are also financial in nature - it will be difficult to solve them on your own. Many difficulties arise on the Saturday before you and will discourage you from acting on the tasks of the day. However, it is not a bad idea to seek the assistance of one of your superiors, or simply explain that you face insurmountable obstacles. You will soon have the opportunity for business advancement. LION On Saturday, those born under Leo are energetic and active, but not in all cases. Many of you are still hesitant, but could take some steps towards a new union or union. You will probably not be able to achieve completely positive results today. Read in our HOROSCOPES section any predictions and prophecies.
DEBAS Saturday marks a new development for many. During the day, you will encounter obstacles that you can hardly remove today. Love problems. Watch out for intimate relationships - conflicts are possible. You will not run into financial problems, but do not undertake risky operations.
Many of Libra today will travel, probably on business issues, but the likelihood of success is almost negligible. Not too many of you who have domestic problems, and on this basis contradictions and anger arise. Perhaps that is all that determines the mood of everyone under the sign on Saturday. SCORPIONDo you are in a good mood today, but it is by no means excluded that it will get dark during the day. There are problems in different areas of your life and they seem to totally cover your entire day. These are financial difficulties, professional troubles, lack of useful contacts, and unexpected changes in some. Many of you may not be very angry, in which case anger is not a good advisor. In the same way, the affairs of businessmen are posed - many problems. Even if you feel a victim of the circumstances, an event will change everything in your life.These zodiac signs most cheat, beware of them!
The main cause of discontent in Capricorn-born people today is mental retardation, which in many cases prevents you from making proper judgments or actions. Most of you are inclined to understand, but very often, existing problems do not allow you to get there. Treat your home affairs with greater responsibility, no matter how big, things are fixable. AQUARIUS
Traveling is also typical of those born under Aquarius, but here are two options that differ in their ability. If you are traveling in personal matters, you are more likely to succeed. But on business and professional issues, disappointments follow as new ones emerge. This will cause many of you to overlook your upcoming obligations, but perhaps this is the best solution for now. You can hope for success in your contacts throughout the day. Many of you will make useful contacts that will spur some important activity.
