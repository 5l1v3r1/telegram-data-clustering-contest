Delhi will restrict certain vehicles for 12 days from Monday, enforcing an odd-even scheme based on number plates to reduce hazardous air pollution.
The Delhi government announced the odd-even scheme after a Supreme Court-mandated panel declared public health emergency in the city and directed all construction activities to be stopped till November 5.
First introduced in 2016, odd-even is a vehicle rationing method that aims at putting a curb on the number of cars on the roads. It allows cars with odd-numbered registration plates to run on odd dates, and those with even-numbered plates on even dates.The scheme would also be applicable to vehicles that are not registered in Delhi.
Reacting to the announcement, cab aggregators Ola and Uber said they would deactivate surge pricing for the entire 12 day-period. ""The Odd-Even scheme is a much needed step to reduce pollution. We whole heartedly support Delhi government's move and wish it success,"" a spokesperson from Uber said.

The story of your father talking to his baby while he is in the womb
It is said that babies do not remember anything when they are born. We only know that after the 20th week, they start to distinguish between sounds. The Brazilian Tarsila Rosa and Flávio Dantas proved how impressive it was.

Tarsila Rosa and Flávio Dantas looked forward to the arrival of their first daughter, Antonella.
His father was looking forward to the day he met him.
He talked to him every time he came home from work.
Although Flávio wasn't sure whether his words would reach her daughter, she never stopped talking to her throughout the entire pregnancy.
Flavio, who caresses his wife Tarsila's belly, told her baby that she would always be there and that she would always love him.
When the baby was born, he showed his ears to his father.
When the father repeated what he had said, the baby greeted him with the most sincere smile.
And that's how he became immortal.
Flávio described his feelings for his daughter as ""a love that doesn't fit in my chest.""
Mom said it was a gift.
