（中央社日內瓦1日綜合外電報導）一名貿易官員指出，世界貿易組織（WTO）仲裁人針對美國反傾銷措施引發的多年爭議，今天授權中國對美國每年價值高達35.8億美元進口商品加徵關稅。
中國先前就此案要求世貿組織許可，對美逾70億美元商品徵稅。
不過世貿組織裁定，非法的美國反傾銷措施已造成「中國利益喪生或減損累積」達35億7912.8萬美元，北京可以每年對不超過此總額的商品徵稅。
這項裁定標誌著，世貿組織首次針對貿易爭議授權中國加徵關稅。（譯者：徐睿承）1081102

(Central News Agency, Geneva, 1st, comprehensive foreign news report) A trade official pointed out that the World Trade Organization (WTO) arbitrators against the US anti-dumping measures caused many years of controversy, today authorized China to impose tariffs on US imports worth up to 3.58 billion US dollars per year.
China has previously requested WTO approval in this case to tax more than $7 billion in US goods.
However, the WTO ruled that illegal US anti-dumping measures have caused ""China's interest to lose or reduce losses"" amounted to 3.5 billion 79.128 million US dollars, and Beijing can tax goods that do not exceed this total amount every year.
The ruling marks the first time that the WTO has authorized China to impose tariffs on trade disputes. (Translator: Xu Ruicheng) 1081102
