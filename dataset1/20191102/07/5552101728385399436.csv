【台積電運動會2】股價衝破300元　劉德音：明年準備大成長
02 Nov 2019, 07:25 by 陳仲興, 董孟航
台積電董事長劉德音今（2日）表示，全球經濟明年雖不是大好的一年，但台積電已經做好準備明年可以大成長。



台積電董事長劉德音今天表示，今年是全球半導體逆風的一年，全球半導體預估衰退12％，半導體除記憶體外，也是預估衰3％，我們可以確定台積電今年營收將比去年成長，雖然不夠多，也是逆勢成長。
對於2020年，劉德音表示，台積電已經做好準備，台積電已經大幅投資產能布建，展望2020年，將是大幅成長的1年，主要因素在於明年處於5G轉換期，台積電的技術乎取得全部智慧型手機客戶的採用，因此，明年會是台積電蠻好的一年。
不過，劉德音說，並不是半導體產業明年都很好，因為明年的經濟不是大好的一年，畢竟，中國經濟成長趨緩，大環境看起來仍險峻，所以，雖然有部分供應鏈回到台灣，經濟短期內看來不錯，但長期來說挑戰仍大，半導體產業的發展也仍具挑戰。

[TSMC Sports 2] stock price broke through 300 yuan Liu Deyin: ready to grow next year
02 Nov 2019, 07:25 by Chen Zhongxing, Dong Menghang
TSMC Chairman Liu Deyin said today (2nd) that although the global economy is not a good year next year, TSMC is ready to grow up next year.



Taiwan’s chairman Liu Deyin said today that this year is the year of global semiconductor headwinds. Global semiconductors are expected to decline by 12%. In addition to memory, semiconductors are also expected to decline by 3%. We can confirm that TSMC’s revenue will grow this year, although not enough. More, it is also a contrarian growth.
For 2020, Liu Deyin said that TSMC is ready, TSMC has invested heavily in capacity building. Looking forward to 2020, it will be a year of substantial growth. The main factor is that it will be in the 5G conversion period next year. TSMC’s technology is all smart. The adoption of mobile phone customers, therefore, next year will be a good year for TSMC.
However, Liu Deyin said that the semiconductor industry is not very good next year, because next year's economy is not a good year. After all, China's economic growth is slowing down, and the big environment still looks dangerous. Therefore, although some supply chains have returned to Taiwan, The economy looks good in the short term, but the challenges are still big in the long run, and the development of the semiconductor industry is still challenging.
