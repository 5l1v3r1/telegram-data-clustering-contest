      <h1>Mum pays tribute to 'beautiful' daughter who died after post-birth tummy op</h1>
      <h2>Louise Harvey from Norwich died of a blood clot after having two operations at Transform Riverside Hospital in London</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T07:44:33+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 07:44</time> by <a rel="author">Louie Smith, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>The mum of a woman who died after having a tummy tuck following the birth to her third child has paid tribute to her "hardworking" and "beautiful" daughter.</p>
      <p>Louise Harvey, 36, suffered a fatal blood clot 18 days after undergoing breast enlargement and tummy tuck ops at a London clinic.</p>
      <p>During the five-day hearing it emerged the beautician was not given a second dose of anticoagulant drugs despite a family history of blood clotting.</p>
      <p>But Coroner Yvonne Blake has now ruled that the missing medication did not contribute to mum-of-three Louise's death.</p>

      <p>Following the inquest her devastated mum Linda said: "I wanted justice for Louise and some answers and I do have some but not all of them.</p>
      <p>“Louise was a hardworking girl. She wasn’t vain, she was beautiful even if she didn’t believe it.</p>
      <p>"We all just miss her so much.”</p>
      <p>Louise, from Norwich, decided to undergo the procedures at Transform Riverside Hospital on 17 June last year.</p>
      <p>Linda explained why her daughter had wanted to go under the knife.</p>
      <p>She said: "She felt she had some loose skin around her belly following the birth of her youngest son".</p>

      <p>Louise was given one dose of blood thinning medication later than is medically recommended and did not receive another prescribed dose, the inquest heard.</p>
      <p>On June 3 and June 9 Louise had flown three hours each way to a family holiday in Bulgaria.</p>
      <p>Her mum said it was her 36-year-old daughter's first time on a plane and she had been "very excited" about the flights and the holiday.</p>

      <p>However, she collapsed on 3 July and died two days later.</p>
      <p>The inquest heard previously heard how her grandmother had also died of a blood clot.</p>
      <p>Linda said Louise had spoken with someone from Transform clinic and "they suggested having (the two operations) at the same time as it would be cheaper".</p>

      <p>Louise collapsed around two weeks after the operation and could not be saved.</p>
      <p>A post-mortem examination found she died of a blood clot in her lungs.</p>
      <p>Coroner Blake gave a narrative conclusion before passing on her "sincere condolences" to Louise's family.</p>
      <p>She said: "In hospital she was given one dose of medication late and one which was prescribed was not given.</p>
      <p>''The evidence shows that this did not cause or contribute to her death."</p>

      <p>Coroner Blake pledged to write to the new owners of the hospital, which has been taken over since Louise's death.</p>
      <p>She said: “I will write an informal letter to the group that took over just explaining I had concerns about policies and documentation and ask them for a copy of their policies.”</p>
