川習會可能地點 考慮美總統大選初選起跑州

（中央社記者江今葉華盛頓1日專電）美國總統川普今天表示，考慮在愛阿華州與中國國家主席習近平會晤，簽署美中第一階段貿易協定，因為「這是農民歷史上最大的訂單」，選擇愛阿華州合乎情理。
美中原先預計在智利聖地牙哥舉行的亞太經濟合作會議（APEC）領袖高峰會上雙邊會談，簽署第一階段貿易協定。但在智利突然宣布取消主辦會議後，美中正在協商挑選新地點。
川普今天出發前往密西西比州前在白宮南草坪向媒體表示，正在考慮愛阿華州，因為這項協議將是史上最大的農民訂單，選擇愛阿華州合乎情理，「這是可能的」。
川普表示，行政團隊正在和中方討論可能地點，習近平願意在美國會面，但「我希望先達成協議」。
愛阿華州是美國主要農業出口州，每年出口的玉米、大豆總額超過140億美元。對於以農業進出口開打的美中貿易戰來說，愛阿華州具有重要象徵意義。
愛阿華州是美國總統兩黨黨內初選第一個投票的州，結果對後續各州投票傾向有一定影響，是兵家必爭之地。愛阿華州也是主要的搖擺州，若是美中貿易協定確定在愛阿華州簽署，對尋求連任的川普將有一定的加分效果。
習近平對愛阿華州也不陌生，他在1985年還是名基層地方幹部時，首次訪美就到過愛阿華州。2012年出任國家主席的習近平再度訪美時，也特別安排再度造訪愛阿華州。兩次以州長身分接待習近平的時任愛阿華州州長布蘭斯塔德（Terry Branstad）於2017年出使北京，擔任美國駐中國大使。（編輯：林憬屏）1081102

Chuan Xihui may be a place to consider the US presidential election primary election starting state
02 Nov 2019, 07:59 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Jiang Jinye, Washington, 1st) US President Trump said today that he is considering meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Iowa and signing the US-China first-phase trade agreement because ""this is the largest order in the history of farmers."" It is reasonable to choose Iowa.
The United States and China originally expected bilateral talks at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders Summit in Santiago, Chile, to sign the first phase of the trade agreement. However, after Chile suddenly announced the cancellation of the host meeting, the United States and China are negotiating to select new locations.
Trump said to the media in the South Lawn of the White House before departing for Mississippi today that he is considering Iowa because the agreement will be the largest farmer order in history. It is reasonable to choose Iowa. ""This is possible.""
Trump said that the administrative team is discussing possible locations with China, and Xi Jinping is willing to meet in the United States, but ""I hope to reach an agreement first.""
Iowa is the main agricultural exporting state in the United States, with annual exports of corn and soybeans totaling more than $14 billion. Iowa has an important symbolic meaning for the US-China trade war that is open to agriculture and import and export.
Iowa is the first state to vote in the US presidential bipartisan primaries. As a result, it has a certain influence on the voting tendencies of the subsequent states, and it is a battleground for the military. Iowa is also the main swing state. If the US-China Trade Agreement is signed in Iowa, Trump will seek a plus effect for re-election.
Xi Jinping is no stranger to Iowa. When he was a grassroots local cadre in 1985, he visited Iowa for the first time in the United States. When Xi Jinping, who became the country's president in 2012, visited the United States again, he also arranged a special visit to Iowa. Terry Branstad, the governor of Iowa, who was the governor of Xi Jinping twice, was sent to Beijing in 2017 as the US ambassador to China. (Edit: Lin Yiping) 1081102
