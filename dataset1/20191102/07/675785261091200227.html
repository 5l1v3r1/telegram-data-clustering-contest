      <h2>Liverpool proved their title credentials in their comeback over Tottenham last week - but can they follow it up against Aston Villa?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T07:28:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 07:28</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/</a></address>

      <p>Villa’s only Premier League defeat in their past four outings has come to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> and they booked their place in the Carabao Cup quarter finals, where they will also play <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , in midweek.</p>
      <p>Here is all you need to know ahead of the Premier League game…</p>
