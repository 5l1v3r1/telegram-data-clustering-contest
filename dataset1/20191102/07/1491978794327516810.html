        <b>Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Our annual heating battle has begun. My partner sets the thermostat at 22C. I turn it down to 19C. He says that’s freezing, blames my Scottish upbringing and pumps it back up again. I say put on another jumper (and save money). Do some people really feel the cold more, or is he just being unreasonable?</p>
