      <p>British police are working with Vietnamese authorities to identify the eight women and 31 men found dead in a lorry in Essex.</p>
      <p>Here is what we know about some of the possible victims, who are all thought to have been from Vietnam.</p>
      <p>– Pham Tra My, 26, has not been in contact with her family since sending a final text message home on October 22 – the day before the lorry was found by police – saying she could not breathe.</p>
      <p>Relatives of Ms Tra My told the BBC they have not been able to contact her since.</p>
      <p>“I am really, really sorry, Mum and Dad, my trip to a foreign land has failed,” she wrote.</p>
      <p>“I am dying, I can’t breathe. I love you very much Mum and Dad. I am sorry, Mother.”</p>

      <p>Ms Tra My is reported to have paid about £30,000 to people smugglers to bring her into the UK illegally.</p>
      <p>– Bui Thi Nhung, 26, is also feared to be among the dead.</p>
      <p>Her brother, Bui Thi Ding, told ITV News: “Nhung would have done any job she could over there. We are so poor here, we barely have enough food to eat, and our father has died.</p>
      <p>"She wanted to go to England to help our elderly mother.”</p>
      <p>Her mother and sister set up an altar in their village of Yen Thanh in north-central Vietnam after a family friend in the UK told them she had died after paying thousands of pounds in the hope of finding work in a nail bar.</p>
      <p>– Nguyen Dinh Gia fears his 20-year-old son, Nguyen Dinh Luong, was among the victims.</p>
      <p>– ITV News named Nguyen Dinh Tu, a 26-year-old whose father said he had hoped to get into Europe to work “in a nail bar” to help pay off family debts.</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore said there were “very, very few” identity documents recovered and that police will share fingerprints with Vietnamese authorities in a bid to identify the bodies.</p>
