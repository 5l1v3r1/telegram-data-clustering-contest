Hamilton triathlete Grant Sheldon hasn't given up on Tokyo dream

Hamilton triathlete Grant Sheldon hasn’t given up on his Tokyo 2020 dream despite a season disrupted by injuries.
The 25-year-old’s season came to an unexpected halt after a freak treadmill accident left him nursing a broken wrist in early October; the latest in a lengthy list of injuries that have left Sheldon frustrated this year.
However, nobody has jumped ahead of him in the queue, and selections have still to be made for the Team GB triathlon team at Tokyo 2020, so Sheldon is in positive mood.
While Sheldon knows he will need to be on peak form next year, he stands a chance.
“Tokyo is still a possibility,” said Sheldon. “In the men’s triathlon no-one has really staked a claim for selection yet, so everything is still up for grabs, the door has definitely not been shut.
“It’s obviously going to be hard, it’s going to rely on me racing really well in February and March to get into the races in April and May.
“The automatic qualifying races have gone and nobody made it, so it’s just about staking a claim for selection the best I can.”

In August Grant, a sportscotland institute of sport supported athlete, secured a third-placed finish at the Karlovy Vary ITU Triathlon World Cup in the Czech Republic, and took another third at the Weihai World Triathlon Cup in China in September, suggesting that the athlete was finding form and fitness before his latest injury.
“It has been a very up and down year with lots of little, unfortunate injuries,” he said.
“In January I fell off my bike and cracked my ribs, then in my first race back I stood on something and sliced my foot open – I had to get stitches on the sole of my foot after that.
“ After that I was just trying to get fit after losing a bit of time. I was building back up towards the end of the season and had a good couple of races, but then I broke my wrist, which has cut the season short.”
Grant made his second Commonwealth Games appearance at the 2018 Gold Coast Games where he finished 17th in the individual event and seventh in the mixed team relay. He also represented Team Scotland at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games, finishing 14th in the individual event and seventh in the mixed team relay.
He has been supported by the sportscotland institute of sport for “eight or nine years”, which Grant says has “been hugely helpful, particularly in the year I’ve just had, which has been so stop-start with injuries”.

Nadal, Djokovic edge closer to possible Paris final

02 Nov 2019, 07:21

Paris - Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, fighting it out for the year-end world number one spot, edged closer to a possible Paris Masters final clash as both eased into the last four on Friday.
The 33-year-old Nadal, who can secure the end-of-year top ranking ahead of Djokovic by winning his maiden Bercy title, beat French wildcard Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-6 (7/4), 6-1.
Nadal is bidding for a record-extending 36th Masters crown and will take on Denis Shapovalov in the last four on Saturday after the Canadian youngster thrashed Gael Monfils 6-2, 6-2.
The Spaniard has reached the semis for the first time at the event since 2013, having withdrawn injured before the quarter-finals on his last appearance in 2017.
""I've had a lot of injuries in this tournament (historically),"" said Nadal. ""I'm happy to be back in the semi-finals.""
Djokovic had earlier crushed seventh seed Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-1, 6-2 and will next face Grigor Dimitrov, who saw off unseeded Chilean Cristian Garin 6-2, 7-5.
Nadal has now reached 73 Masters semi-finals in total and is two wins away from his 85th ATP title, but only third indoors.
Tsonga was rock solid on serve in a first set which did not see a single service game from either player even reach deuce.
But second seed Nadal stepped it up in the tie-break, with two incredible winners on the run helping him take a crucial one-set lead.
Tsonga's serve briefly deserted him in the second game of the second set, as successive double faults allowed Nadal to claim the first break of the match and he then sped to victory.
Djokovic said he played ""one of his best matches of the season"" to thrash Tsitsipas.
The 32-year-old dispatched his Greek opponent in only 58 minutes.
The 16-time Grand Slam champion went into the match with a 2-1 losing record against Tsitsipas, but put the young world number seven in his place with a commanding victory.
""I played one of the best matches of the season,"" said Djokovic. ""I prepared myself very well for this match.
""I lost to Stefanos about three weeks ago in Shanghai. And obviously I went through the videos and understanding on what I did well, what I didn't do so well, what I can do better.""
Djokovic will be usurped by Nadal at the top of the rankings next week, but can ensure the race to be the best player at the end of the year reaches the ATP Tour Finals in London by winning a fifth Paris Masters title.
The defeat ended Tsitsipas' run of three consecutive semi-finals and dealt a blow to his confidence ahead of his maiden appearance at the season-ending championships, which start on November 10.
Djokovic holds an 8-1 winning head-to-head record against Dimitrov.
""He (Dimitrov) has been one of the best talents we had in the sport in the last decade,"" said Djokovic, who is bidding to tie Pete Sampras' record of finishing as the year-end number one on six occasions.
""He's been playing some terrific tennis this week... I don't play too bad myself, so it's going to be for sure a good one.""
Former world number three Dimitrov last reached the semis at a Masters tournament in Monte Carlo in 2018, but has rediscovered his form in recent weeks after heading into the US Open ranked 78th.
The Bulgarian became the lowest-ranked player to reach a Grand Slam semi-final since 2008 at Flushing Meadows, before losing to Daniil Medvedev.
World number 42 Garin, playing in his first Masters quarter-final, served for the second set at 5-4, but the 28-year-old Dimitrov reeled off three straight games to claim an impressive victory.
Shapovalov cruised into the fourth Masters semi-final of his young career by ending Monfils' bid to reach the ATP Finals.
Home favourite Monfils was one victory away from pipping Italian Matteo Berrettini to a ticket to London, but was blown away by a brilliant Shapovalov performance.
""He (Berrettini) had better give me a bottle of wine or something,"" joked world number 28 Shapovalov.
