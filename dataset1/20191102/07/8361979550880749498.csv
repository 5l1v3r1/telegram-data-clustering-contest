【台積電運動會5】蓋不蓋電廠？　魏哲家：台積電本身不蓋
02 Nov 2019, 07:25 by 陳仲興, 董孟航
台積電首度表明太陽能電廠的發展計畫，未來將由合作廠商來蓋，台積電再百分之百收購發出來的電，台積電本身不會投資蓋電廠。



台積電總裁魏哲家表示，關於太陽能電廠的議題，台積電會與政府合作，找的土地由合作廠商蓋電廠，台積電會完全使用，未來朝百分之百的綠電方向走，至於未來能採用多少比例的綠電，則要看台灣未來的發展。
也就是說，台積電本身不會蓋太陽能電廠，這個模式與蘋果公司的做法類似，只不過，蘋果公司本身是與太陽能電廠或製造廠商合作，並投入大筆資金蓋太陽能電廠，台積電則是完全不投入資金，只承諾會百分之百採用太陽能電廠合作廠商發出來的電，百分之百收購使用。
台積電在7月11日的環評會議中表示，為了達到政府採用20％綠電的目標，正與屏東縣政府洽談合作，希望主導開發大型太陽能電廠。不過，究竟是如何主導開發太陽能電廠，台積電並未明說。今天台積電首度表示，不會自己蓋太陽能電廠，而是由合作廠商蓋電廠的方式進行。

The crack of the establishment. Former senior Ukrainian diplomat in the United States shares insiders about the “green” scandal in the White House
On Friday, November 1, the former Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, Valery Chaly, in an exclusive interview with Radio NV, spoke about the scandal surrounding the telephone conversation between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Zelensky and its implications for bilateral relations.

Here is the main thing that we learned from his speech:
Ukrainogate
The Ukrainian diplomats were not allowed to meet on July 10, 2019 between the then Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Alexander Danilyuk, Assistant to the President of Ukraine Andrey Yermak and representatives of the White House.
It was this meeting during the testimony in Congress that Alexander Windman, the chief expert on Ukraine at the US National Security Council, mentioned. According to him, the US ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, who was present at her, began to hint at the need for certain investigations in Ukraine for the possibility of a future meeting between Zelensky and Trump.
Windman claims that it was about launching investigations into possible interference with the 2016 US elections, as well as the case of Burisma, whose main defendant is the son of Trump's main rival in the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden.

“I should have been at this meeting as an ambassador, but having already passed through the [White House] security service and entering the building of the National Security Council [USA], I was told that diplomats (not only the ambassador, but the embassy diplomats) must participate in this meeting. I executed this order because the link was that this order was from Kiev, that is, from the President’s Office (and not from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), ”said the ex-ambassador Chaly.
The diplomat assumes that starting from July 10, ""some other means of work of the USA began to be used, than through the embassy, than through official channels.""
The possibility of adding the Azov regiment to the list of terrorist organizations in the United States
Former ambassador Valery Chaly believes that if the US government considers the Ukrainian regiment Azov to be a terrorist organization, this threatens a complete cessation of military-technical cooperation between Ukraine and the United States.
The diplomat explains his assumption that Azov is part of the National Guard of Ukraine, the official defense structure of the country, so the United States will stop supplying weapons and conducting exercises with the state if one of its defense sector components is recognized as terrorist.
“I’m not sure that even the congressmen who signed [under the resolution] know that Azov is now part of the National Guard of Ukraine. Do you understand what is happening? This proposal is to recognize Azov, which is part of the National Guard and our defense system, a terrorist organization. What will happen then? Catastrophe! This is a disaster, because if we hypothetically assume (I think this will not happen) that such a decision could be made, then we certainly would not have received any training programs, no weapons, nothing. This will completely stop our cooperation in the military-technical sphere, ”said Chaly.
The ex-ambassador invited the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Vadim Pristayko to pay an official visit to the United States to resolve this issue - ""you need to act quickly,"" said Chaly.
The new ambassador of Ukraine to the USA
“Almost optimal”, Chaly considers Volodymyr Yelchenko, now holding the post of Permanent Representative of Ukraine to the United Nations, his successor.
“He has vast experience. I believe that even now in [his] place, a permanent representative to the UN, he has done a lot there during his tenure in this second cadence. But if such a decision is made and the corresponding decree of the president is signed after receiving the agreman in the United States, if he is ambassador Vladimir Yelchenko, I believe that this decision is almost optimal under these conditions, ”Chaly described his colleague.
Also, a former employee of the Ukrainian embassy in the United States spoke about the reasons for his resignation.
“I simply, according to the law on the diplomatic service, worked there for a full period, more than four years,” said Chaly.

US military assistance to Ukraine
“The total amount of US military assistance for next year is only $ 750 million. And we go out somewhere for almost $ 400 million in military assistance, ”the diplomat said.
According to Chaly, Ukraine receives more than 90% of military assistance from the United States: in particular, America provides Javelin anti-tank missile systems, Island class patrol boats, and also conducts trainings and joint exercises of American and Ukrainian military personnel.
