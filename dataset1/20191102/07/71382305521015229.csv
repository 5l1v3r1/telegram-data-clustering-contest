On the 102nd anniversary of Balfour's ominous promise
Our resistance continues, and all promises, deals and plots will not pass
The Balfour Declaration commemorates the 102nd anniversary of our Palestinian people. The institutions since the establishment of the alleged Zionist entity in 1948 on the ruins of the villages, camps and cities of our people because of the unfortunate and unfortunate promise of the British Foreign Secretary Destroying Balfour, which enabled the Zionist gangs of our Palestinian land.
The British government, which gave this unjust promise to the Zionists, has caused tragedy and suffering for decades of our great Palestinian people, and continues to this day, and the results and outcomes of this false promise the forthcoming declaration of the so-called deal of the century, which is rejected by our entire people, Balfour promise. Not legally permissible and contrary to all humanitarian norms and international laws; which is what Britain should retreat from, and apologize to the Palestinian people for the disasters and massacres caused for more than a century.
Since the Balfour Declaration of 1917, the Zionist entity occupied its land from 1948 to the present day, it has faced all forms of aggression, and stressed throughout history, despite many bloody and painful stations and many false resolutions and international conspiracies, its adherence to its homeland of Palestine, and it is still He lives in his heart and soul, and is willing to sacrifice for his freedom and independence, and that can not in any way give up a grain of dust from them, and stood steadfast and steadfast resistance, and did not succeed all conspiracies and agreements to undermine his solid will, break his legendary steadfastness, and the fall of his just rights despiteHaullac normalization with the Zionist entity, and scrambling toward him to give false legitimacy it.
The anniversary of the fateful Balfour Declaration comes and the city of Jerusalem is exposed to the fiercest Zionist attempts to Judaize it, change its features, seize the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which the Israeli soldiers and herds of settlers continue to storm and desecrate, close its doors, attack the Almoravids and stationed in it, and expel worshipers from its yards.
We in the Islamic Resistance Movement ""Hamas"" and in this painful memory of our people we emphasize:
First, the treacherous Balfour Declaration, which founded the tragedy of the century, created the greatest historic grievance that still exists, and established a Zionist occupation entity on our Palestinian land, and with the support of Britain, which gave itself the right to act in the land and capabilities of our people - is a false promise since its launch, and a theft of history. , And the rights of our people, which bear the disasters and tragedies that have befallen our people because of it.
Secondly, we applaud the free voices voiced at the United Nations meeting in the seventy-fourth session, which declared its solidarity with the Palestinian people and its occupied territory, and faired our people by recognizing their right to establish their state and restore their rights. We also call on all countries of the world to do the same in ending the occupation and leaving our land. .
Third: Our Palestinian people will remain committed to the resistance in all its forms, especially the armed resistance to confront the Zionist occupation, and its heinous crimes against our people, until the achievement of its desired goals of freedom and independence.
Fourth: The attempts at normalization with the Zionist entity that usurped our land are rejected in all its forms, and it is a betrayal of our Palestinian people and a treacherous stab for its enormous sacrifices.
Fifth: The Movement renews its support for all efforts aimed at achieving Palestinian unity and arranging the Palestinian house, on the basis of partnership to face the challenges facing the Palestinian cause, and its liquidation projects. It also affirms its full readiness to contest and succeed the democratic process, and to hold comprehensive elections in the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem to formulate a new Palestinian situation. The interests of our people and able to achieve their ambitions.
Sixth: The right of the Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and countries from which they left is a legitimate and firm right, and is guaranteed by international laws and UN resolutions.
Seventh: We salute all the people of our Palestinian people in all places of its existence, in the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza, 48, Diaspora and immigrants, for this legendary stability, the epic struggle to defeat the occupation and the return of our land as an independent Palestine with Jerusalem as its capital. Occupied Jerusalem, we consider Jerusalem the beating heart of Palestine, the essence of the real conflict with this brute occupier.
Eighth: The marches of return and breaking the siege are an icon in the joint national action with the Palestinian factions and the whole of our people, and as an extension of its long struggle, the sacrifices and great will of our people constituted an advanced step in facing the projects of liquidating its just cause, dropping the so-called deal of the century, and dropping the Balfour Declaration. It requires strengthening the factors of strength and resilience, and mobilize all the energies of the nation to support him, and stand by him until the liberation of his land and sanctities.
