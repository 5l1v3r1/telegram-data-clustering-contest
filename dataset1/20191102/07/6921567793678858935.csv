BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) — Bournemouth beat Manchester United 1-0 in the Premier League on Saturday to increase the pressure on United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
Bournemouth provisionally climbed to sixth in the table with the win, which was sealed by Joshua King’s goal shortly before halftime.
The United defense allowed King plenty of time to control Adam Smith’s cross with his chest, flick the ball over his head and knock it through David De Gea’s legs.
United’s defense was slow to react again in the 74th minute, when De Gea dived at full stretch to push Harry Wilson’s shot wide.
Defeat in pouring rain on England’s south coast ended a recent resurgence for United. It had won its last three games, but has now also failed to win five of its last six league games.
United is three points behind Bournemouth.
King’s strike was Bournemouth’s first league goal since Sept. 28. The Cherries are looking to recover some of their strong early-season form after a five-game winless run in all competitions.

The ball is a detail: From the sublime to the pathetic
02 Nov 2019, 07:00 by Marcos Guedes

Sao Paulo

Almost nothing irritates a fan as much as seeing on his team people who don't care about him. The disinterested player, the one who leaves the lawn with his shirt dry, provokes convulsive reactions in those forced to cheer for his success — ask anyone who has had Duck wearing his colors.
The answer is logically the inverse of the noise. If the subject surrenders in the field and shows a concern with the score slightly similar to that displayed by those in the stands, already takes a huge step toward the heart of the crowd, even if the technique is not proportional to the commitment.
In today's football, there is a whole mechanism of distance between players and fans. In the business logic, the fan became a customer and the idol became an Instagram profile. The attacker who dares to climb the steps of modern stadiums and approaches the public to celebrate a goal must, by regulation, be warned by card.
Rare, genuine moments of identification run through the sublime. One of them occurred on Wednesday, when Pedrinho of Corinthians celebrated, among sobs, the goal scored in his homeland.
""We, who are from Alagoas, know what happens to get to football. I'm very happy to make a goal here in Maceio. I want to talk to the guys here: never give up, because when God wants, anything is possible"", said the boy, weeping, with a total of 0% of affectation.

It was beautiful. Then the break passed, and his team lost 2-1 to the weak CSA team, an apathetic performance that sparked a general upheaval among the Corinthians.
When the match was over, Pedrinho returned to the microphone in which he had shed beautiful tears. The one who had provoked love by caring so much about a goal gave hollow statements in automatic mode and even went so far as to say, ""We had a good game.""
Pedrinho of the break is hope, is all the fan wants, is the fan himself. The after-game Pedrinho is another Duck.
