A bola é um detalhe: Do sublime ao patético
02 Nov 2019, 07:00 by Marcos Guedes

São Paulo

Quase nada irrita tanto um torcedor quanto ver em seu time gente que não se importa com ele. O jogador desinteressado, aquele que deixa o gramado com a camisa sequinha, provoca reações convulsivas nos que se veem obrigados a torcer por seu sucesso —pergunte a qualquer um que já teve Pato vestindo suas cores.
A resposta é logicamente a inversa diante do raçudo. Se o sujeito se entrega em campo e mostra uma preocupação com o placar levemente parecida com a exibida pelos que estão na arquibancada, já dá um passo enorme em direção ao coração da galera, mesmo que a técnica não seja proporcional ao empenho.
No futebol atual, há todo um mecanismo de distanciamento entre jogadores e torcida. Na lógica do negócio, o torcedor virou cliente e o ídolo se tornou um perfil no Instagram. O atacante que ousa subir as escadinhas dos estádios modernos e se aproxima do publico para celebrar um gol deve, por regulamento, ser advertido com cartão.
Raros, os momentos genuínos de identificação raiam pelo sublime. Um deles ocorreu na quarta-feira, quando Pedrinho, do Corinthians, comemorou, entre soluços, o gol marcado em sua terra 
""A gente, que é alagoano, sabe o que passa para chegar ao futebol. Eu fico muito feliz de fazer um gol aqui em Maceió. Quero falar para a rapaziada daqui: nunca desista, porque, quando Deus quer, tudo é possível"", disse o garoto, aos prantos, com um total de 0% de afetação.


Pedrinho se emocionou e emocionou ao ir à rede em sua Maceió -Amanda Perobelli - 25.jul.19/Reuters

Foi lindo. Aí, passou o intervalo, e o time dele perdeu por 2 a 1 para a fraca equipe do CSA, uma atuação apática que gerou revolta geral entre os corintianos.
Terminada a partida, Pedrinho voltou ao microfone no qual havia derramado lágrimas bonitas. O mesmo que provocara amor ao se importar tanto com um gol deu declarações vazias, no modo automático, e chegou ao ponto de dizer: ""Fizemos um bom jogo"".
O Pedrinho do intervalo é a esperança, é tudo o que o torcedor quer, é o próprio torcedor. O Pedrinho do pós-jogo é mais um Pato.

Blantyre Reverend drops five dress sizes
'Weigh' to go Rev. Sarah Ross of Blantyre Old Parish Church.

A Blantyre minister who was never a fan of diet clubs is now singing their praises.
The Reverend Sarah Ross, of Blantyre Old Parish Church, has dropped from a size 18 to a size 8 in just a few months thanks to WW (the new Weight Watchers)

.
Now she is inspiring other ministers to lose weight and has been overwhelmed by the backing of her congregation.
The 43-year-old, who started her weight loss journey weighing 13st 12.5lbs, has now slimmed down to 9st 13lbs, a weight she has not seen in 25 years.
Sarah explained: “As someone in the public eye, having my sparkle back is important, being able to be confident yet gentle, creative, innovative and full of energy.
“Now I know I am honouring my life – a gift given to me, and only I can treasure this gift.
“I now run 5km three times a week, and sometimes 10km. I am fitter and healthier and make much more effort to eat healthier.

“I completed my first 10km race in June 2019, something I have always wanted to do, but was never fit or confident enough. I have also just started netball for the first time since high school and I am loving it.”
Church of Scotland minister Sarah has a congregation of over 100, and their support has been appreciated.
She explained: “Often, I have been asked if I am well and losing weight on purpose.
“Perhaps in my line of work, sudden weight loss is the sign of something else. I never intended to be an inspiration to others, at least it was never my goal.
“Now the irony is that as someone who didn’t like diet clubs, I am singing the praises of WW.
“I deal with requests for information from colleagues and friends, and I’m happy to have pointed a few in the right direction.”
Sarah made her decision to lose weight as a New Year resolution for 2019.
She added: “The latter part of 2018 had been very challenging due to a traumatic event in my work.
“It had affected my confidence, and I hit a very low point in my mood and sense of self. Despite being a minister and a person of faith, I found myself going through the motions.
“Christmas, a season that normally I love, did very little for me. Of course, there were highlights, and I think the highlights showed me how far I had fallen from my bright, optimistic, hopeful self.
“With the beginning of a new year, an opportunity to start a new chapter, make resolutions and make 2019 my year I decided to take back my life. I sent a message to my friend Danielle asking her to join me in doing the Couchto5K app.
“Running, something I never thought I could do, was something I had dipped in and out of through previous years, but my general fitness levels were poor. She agreed she would support me if I would join her at WW. I didn’t have any confidence in diet classes, but being a fair person at heart, I felt I couldn’t make her do my challenge and not do hers.
“So, reluctantly I went to the first workshop with Danni to Calderwood Community Centre, where honestly, I felt like I was in a strange universe. I had to work hard to swallow my cynicism, but the coach Christine Fleming was very welcoming, and Danni held my hand, not literally, but I know there is not a chance I would have walked in myself.
“Since that first workshop, I haven’t missed one, unless I was on holiday, and now count all the members as friends. Sharing the journey with Danni, Christine and others at 8am on a Saturday morning has been worth it.”
