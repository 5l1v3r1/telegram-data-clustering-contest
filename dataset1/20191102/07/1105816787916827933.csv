Fawad Chaudhry warns opposition not to underestimate the govt

ISLAMABAD  : Federal Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry on Saturday warned the opposition not to mistake the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government as weak.
The minister took to social media and said the government is exercising self-restraint – over the protest led by JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, pressurising the premier to step down – on the directives of Prime Minister Imran Khan.
“Don’t dare to underestimate PTI government, we are exercising self-restraint because Imran Khan has desired so,” he wrote.
The federal minister also noted that if the premier wanted, he could make a phone call to deal with the matter, warning the Azadi march leaders – including PPP, PML-N and JUI-F – that they would not find any place to hide.



“If he makes a call these bunch of opportunists will not find a place to hide in Pakistan.”
 



The JUI-F chief has set a two-day deadline for PM Imran to step down.
“People have given their verdict… they want freedom from this government,” the 66-year-old firebrand cleric said while addressing tens of thousands of opposition workers camping in Sector H-9 on Friday.
The two opposition parties – PPP and PML-N – have thrown their weight behind the Maulana because their leaders are facing corruption charges which they claim are part of premier Imran’s political vendetta.
“We want the state institutions to be impartial and withdraw their support to this illegitimate government,” the cleric said, adding that they did not want confrontation with the state institutions.
