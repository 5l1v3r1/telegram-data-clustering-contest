【台積電運動會4】摩爾定律何時終結？　張忠謀：沒有人知道
02 Nov 2019, 07:25 by 陳仲興, 董孟航
台積電創辦人張忠謀認為，摩爾定律何時終結這個問題的答案，沒有人知道，因為後面至少還有5奈米、3奈米和2奈米的技術。



台積電創辦人張忠謀表示，1998年曾有人問他和英特爾前執行長貝瑞特（Barrett）被問到摩爾定律何時之前有效？貝瑞特的回答是或許15到20年，他的回答則是20年（也就是2018年），但是他們兩個人都錯了，因為現在看起來，後面至少還有5奈米、3奈米和2奈米，因此，現在這個問題的答案他不會給一個固定的日子，因為沒有人知道答案，摩爾定律未來可以說是山窮水盡疑無路，柳暗花明又一村。
張忠謀認為，5G、物聯網和AI（人工智慧）未來都很夠摩爾定律繼續發展，未來全世界70億人口當中，3到40億人的職業甚至生活型態會被5G和AI這些技術改變，下週一行政院科技會報，他也會對AI和5G未來可能但來什麼設會問題和解決方法提出報告。


劉德音則表示，未來半導體的技術會繼續發展，因為計算是永遠不夠的，而且將無處不在。

[TSMC Games 4] When will Moore's Law end? Zhang Zhongmou: No one knows
02 Nov 2019, 07:25 by Chen Zhongxing, Dong Menghang
Zhang Zhongmou, founder of TSMC, believes that when Moore's Law ends the answer to this question, no one knows because there are at least 5 nanometers, 3 nanometers and 2 nanometers of technology behind.



Zhang Zhongmou, founder of TSMC, said that in 1998, he was asked and former Intel CEO Barrett was asked when Moore's Law was effective. Barrett’s answer is that perhaps 15 to 20 years, his answer is 20 years (that is, 2018), but both of them are wrong, because now it seems that there are at least 5 nm, 3 M and 2 nm, therefore, the answer to this question now will not give a fixed day, because no one knows the answer, Moore's Law can be said to be a mountain in the future, and there is no way to go.
Zhang Zhongmou believes that the future of 5G, Internet of Things and AI (artificial intelligence) is sufficient for Moore's Law to continue to develop. In the future, among the 7 billion people in the world, the occupational and even life styles of 3 to 4 billion people will be changed by technologies such as 5G and AI. Next Monday, the Executive Yuan Science and Technology Conference will report on the possible problems and solutions for AI and 5G in the future.


Liu Deyin said that the technology of semiconductors will continue to develop in the future, because computing is never enough, and it will be everywhere.

Liu Deyin, chairman of TSMC, said that the future of semiconductor technology will continue to develop, because computing is never enough, and will be everywhere, which is the guarantee and driving force for future technological development.
