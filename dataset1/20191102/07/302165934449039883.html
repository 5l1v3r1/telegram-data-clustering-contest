      <p>GENK (Belgium), Oct 23 — Liverpool have condemned a graphic “racist” banner unfurled by fans before the start of their Champions League Group E clash away at Racing Genk on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The banner, displayed in an area populated by travelling fans, depicted Liverpool’s Belgian striker Divock Origi’s head on a naked body, alongside the Champions League trophy.</p>
      <p>In a statement released shortly before kick-off Liverpool said they had acted swiftly to have the banner removed, saying it “perpetuated a racist stereotype”.</p>
      <p>“This is completely unacceptable,” a club statement said. “Liverpool Football Club condemns the offensive banner displayed in our section of the ground, prior to kick-off.</p>
      <p>“We acted swiftly to have the banner removed and we are now working with the local authorities and stadium team in Genk to identify those responsible.</p>
      <p>“Any subsequent action will be taken in keeping with our sanctions process.” — Reuters</p>
