      <p>Next year in May, Bandai Namco's mascot <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/pac_man">Pac-Man</a></b> turns 40. At this point, he's pretty much done it all. Heck, he's even become a regular fighter in the <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_smash_bros">Super Smash Bros.</a></b> roster.</p>
      <p>To celebrate the upcoming occasion, Bamco has launched an official PAC-MAN 40th Anniversary theme song as part of its new campaign "Join the PAC". It was composed by the famed Japanese techno producer, DJ. Ken Ishii. There's also a music video to go with it.</p>
      <p>Here's a bit more about it, along with the clip:</p>
      <blockquote>The music video for the song is directed by the famous director, Yuichi Kodama, who in 2008, won awards in the Cannes International Advertising Festival, the Clio Awards and the One Show Interactive.<br/><br/>He was also the chief video director for the flag handover ceremony at the closing of the Rio Olympics in 2016.</blockquote>
