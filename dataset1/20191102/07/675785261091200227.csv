Liverpool showed title-winning credentials as they bounced back from their first slip-up of the season last week.
Following a draw at Manchester United - the first time the Reds dropped points in the league - they came from a goal down to beat Tottenham at Anfield.
Now they must carry on in the same vein with a trip to Aston Villa, who are warming nicely to life back in the Premier League.
Villa’s only Premier League defeat in their past four outings has come to Manchester City and they booked their place in the Carabao Cup quarter finals, where they will also play Liverpool , in midweek.
