      <h1>Manu Tuilagi's girlfriend is Chantelle Garrity with whom he has 18-month-old daughter</h1>
      <h2>Tuilagi is one of the key parts of the England squad and is being cheered on from the stands by his girlfriend and daughter</h2>

      <p>Manu Tuilagi's settled home life has been credited for keeping his career on track as he prepares to play in the Rugby World Cup Final.</p>
      <p>Tuilagi became a father 18 months ago and settling down with fiancee Chantelle Garrity has helped him focus on the latter stages of his international career.</p>
      <p>Chantelle is a Manchester University graduate who went on to work in her family's Leicestershire-based construction company as a business development manager.</p>
      <p>She now spends the majority of her time at home looking after their daughter, Leilani Lea'auta, whose name translates to 'heavenly flower'.</p>

      <p>Chantelle has posted a host of pictures on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> of Lani sending messages of support to Tuilagi.</p>
      <p>She was over in Tokyo for the early stages of the competition before heading home, while it is unknown if she will be travelling back again for the final.</p>
      <p>In three photos featured on Chantelle's Instagram, Lani is seen wearing an England shirt.</p>

      <p>A chalkboard is also featured on the pics, one with the message reading "go daddy" from before the semi-final vs New Zealand and another saying "so proud daddy" following the game.</p>
      <p>The settled home life that Tuilagi lead is partly responsible for the success he is now having on the pitch, according to England defence coach John Mitchell.</p>
      <p>"He's also older now, he's also a father and that brings responsibilities and a different maturity as well," Mitchell said.</p>

      <p>"He's in a particularly good space because he is being managed well, he is being led well which then leads to his own leadership taking ownership of it.</p>
      <p>"He is just that much older. He's obviously been through a few rugby movies in his time and this stage doesn't always come around."</p>
