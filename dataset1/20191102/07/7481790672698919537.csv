京阪ケーブルカーで酒気帯び…上司が呼気データ改ざん

02 Nov 2019, 07:01

　京阪電鉄は１日、京都府八幡市の「石清水八幡宮参道ケーブル」で先月３０日、４０歳代の男性社員が酒気帯び状態で運転操作をしたと発表した。社員は呼気検査でアルコールの数値が社内規定を超えていたが、上司が自分のデータを使わせていた。他にも４人が同様の不正を行っていたことも判明。近く処分を検討する。
　発表によると、社員は先月２９日夜にビール６杯を飲み、３０日朝、業務前の検査で社内基準（呼気１リットルあたり０・１ミリ・グラム）を超えるアルコールを検知。報告を受けた５０歳代の男性上司が、自分のデータを使って記録し、駅での運転操作をさせたという。
　３０日昼、京阪本社に利用客から「ケーブルカーの社員が酒臭い」とメールが届いたが、京阪本社の事実確認が遅れ、男性社員は終日、運転操作を行った。報告を受けた近畿運輸局は１日、京阪に原因究明と再発防止を指示した。

Keihan cable car drunk ... Boss falsifies breath data

02 Nov 2019, 07:01

Keihan Electric Railway Co., Ltd. announced on January 30 that a 40-year-old male employee was driving in a drunk state at the “Ishikimizu Hachimangu Shrine Cable” in Hachiman, Kyoto. Employees had a breath test and alcohol levels exceeded company regulations, but their boss used their data. It was also found that four others were doing the same fraud. Consider disposal soon.
According to the announcement, employees drink 6 glasses of beer on the night of 29th last month, and on the morning of 30th, alcohol that exceeds internal standards (0.1 milligram per liter of breath) was detected in the pre-work inspection. A male boss in his 50s who received the report recorded it using his own data and operated it at the station.
At noon on the 30th, an email was sent from the customer to the Keihan headquarters saying “Cable car employees smelled of alcohol”, but confirmation of the facts at Keihan head office was delayed, and male employees operated all day. The Kinki Transportation Bureau, which received the report, ordered Keihan to investigate the cause and prevent recurrence on the 1st.
