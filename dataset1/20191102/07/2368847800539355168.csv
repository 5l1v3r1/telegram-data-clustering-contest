大紀元新唐人見證「少年香港」的鍛造時刻

02 Nov 2019, 07:21

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】「港人的善良、正義和堅持，正在改變這個世界。三個多月來，我們及時地向外報導了反送中的實質和香港危機真相。中共是紙老虎，這一次中共會敗在香港。最後一道柏林牆將在這裡被推倒」，香港大紀元時報社長郭君說。
數月以來，大紀元新唐人記者堅守反送中現場，每週末與重大事件皆有第一線的直播；除了採訪香港官員議員、專家學者、社工、明星和年輕抗爭者，也連線多位香港評論員，並派遣記者在前線採訪報導。第一時間將香港前線報導，透過衛星電視、有線電視、報紙、YouTube、Facebook、推特等平台，迅速傳遞至國際社會。
與此同時，大紀元新唐人為香港年輕人所受的莫須有罪名感到沉痛，卻也目睹了無數香港年輕人面對暴力威脅時，大是大非的氣度以及決不退縮的勇敢，令人感到此時的「少年香港」，才是神州未來的希望。

中共黑幫治國 洗腦更甚1984

舉世皆知，中共不只是專斷殘賊的獨夫，更是一部龐大而媚俗的國家機器。奧威爾筆下的《1984》，假新聞洗腦和不計代價摧毀政敵的風氣，正在香港上演，對象是數以萬計的莘莘學子，也是國家能否走向蓬勃未來的重要指標。
近代「維新先驅」梁啟超著有〈少年中國論〉，直指能夠創造未來的「少年」才是中國進步的基石：
「少年智則國智，少年富則國富；少年強則國強，少年獨立則國獨立；少年自由則國自由；少年進步則國進步；少年勝於歐洲，則國勝於歐洲；少年雄於地球，則國雄於地球。」
然而，中共卻正往香港輸出暴力，利用黑幫治國的手段，肆無顧忌地打壓能為中國帶來繁榮的翩翩少年，試圖用斧頭將他們擊倒，以鐮刀收割寶貴的年輕靈魂。
危急存亡之秋，一批批少年少女奮不顧身地守在最前線，受到感動的香港人也自發性地向外界遞出真實資訊、影片，並利用白宮網站發起請願連署，大是大非，認清中國不等於中共的香港人，在最危難的時刻，向外界、中國大陸展現了最堅實也最可貴的自由精神。

國民教育洗腦 中共大膽妄想

10月13日，大紀元報導臺灣師範大學政治所教授范世平出席「海峽論壇」，談及香港人對於中共政府已經由失望轉為憤怒，而今已是悲壯。
這股悲壯的氛圍，追根究柢，是因為香港的少年們本無意成就英雄，卻被暴政逼上梁山。不論是「和理非」或是「勇武派」，都是被迫出面，而非自動拿起面罩，穿上黑衫，又把遺書揣在口袋。
白衣人痛毆示威者、港警假扮抗議民眾、解放軍假扮港警等劇情，一再於香港上演，世人為之震驚：沒有人想得到中共竟然會將對付大陸維權人士的流氓手段用在香港。

這種由政府蹂躪人民的治理狀態，正如大紀元資深調查記者菲利普（Joshua Philipp）所寫：
「當今的極權體制中，人民的權利是政府給予的，而非反過來。在這樣的前提下沒有天賦人權的存在空間，在政府部之外也沒有造物主的存在。人民的幸福建立在金錢與縱情聲色上而非美德，一般民眾被認為過於愚蠢，不配擁有自由。」
早先的國民教育變成黨文化的洗腦教育，也清楚反映了中共正虎視眈眈香港年輕人，讓他們從小就習慣愛黨等於愛國的思維模式，最終培養出列寧口中「有用的白痴」。

色情暴力襲港 青年人格何在

除了洗腦教育，中共還持續透過港府輸出的暴力與色情，進一步染指香港年輕人。
即便林鄭月娥已經撤回逃犯條例修正案，「跳海有血、跳樓卻無血」等「被自殺」案件仍舊頻傳，還有令人不忍卒睹的警方對示威者使用性暴力事件。
9月28日，大紀元報導，一名示威者通過中環愛丁堡廣場集會披露，他被關押在新屋嶺拘留中心期間，曾被脫光衣服綁住四肢，戴上頭套，遭到至少2名警察性侵、酷刑虐待。
這名示威者稱，「我相信，我不是唯一一個受酷刑及性侵對待的人。」

10月10日，中文大學女學生吳傲雪挺身而出，摘掉面罩，正面指控警方對她騷擾，並說明確實有被抓到新屋嶺拘留中心的年輕人，遭遇令人不忍卒睹的性侵和虐待。
隔日，曾參與反送中，擅長跳水的15歲女學生陳彥霖，失蹤多日後，浮屍海面，警方指其落海自殺「無可疑」。但死者生前深諳水性、死時卻屍體赤裸，警方證詞與反常積極的捕撈動作，啟人疑竇。
新唐人記者大宇則在《拍案驚奇》節目中，指出陳彥霖生前遭到警方跟蹤，情緒崩潰大哭，卻也不忘拍影片鼓勵其他示威者，並向港警喊話：「生於斯，死於斯，香港人何必為難香港人。」

天滅中共必臨 少年香港抵高牆

10月12日週六，「反緊急法遊行」在下午3時冒雨起步，現場民眾高喊「光復香港 時代革命」、「香港人 反抗」、「我有權戴口罩」、「蒙面無罪 立法無理」等口號。
大量港人無懼抗議，沿途高唱《願榮光歸香港》，還有民眾拿著「全民抗共 反極權」的標語。

途中，香港大紀元記者梁珍訪問一名曾被警察暴打的C同學，香港是否能由年輕人守住？
「我覺得我們行，可以守護得住香港。因為我們有的，不單單是人，還有一種強烈的信念在。所以我覺得，你就算打傷了我們所有的人，殺我們多少人都好，我們的信念，我們的理念依然存在，永遠不會消滅，不會被任何阻力打壓下去。」C同學說。
大紀元記者方天亮在香港報導指出，這些年輕人之所以走出來，並非受到政治煽動，而是因為他們「沒有利益的權衡，沒有人心的顧慮，沒有家庭的羈絆」。
「很多年輕人說，這是關乎香港存亡的大事，是維護香港價值觀的事，是善與惡的問題，沒有中間地帶，哪怕是雞蛋撞高牆，他們也要衝出去。」方天亮寫道。
報導中提及，曾參與1989年「六四」民運的王華，撰文感慨這批走在香港抗爭最前線的年輕人，就像是當年被中共害死的同伴們。他們如今從北京轉生到了香港，目的就是要完成未竟的使命。

The Epoch Times New Tang Dynasty witnesses the forging moment of ""Juvenile Hong Kong""

02 Nov 2019, 07:21

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] ""The kindness, justice and perseverance of Hong Kong people are changing the world. For more than three months, we have reported in a timely manner the truth of the reversal and the truth about the Hong Kong crisis. The CCP is a paper tiger. This time the CCP will be defeated in Hong Kong. The last Berlin Wall will be pushed down here,"" said Guo Jun, president of the Hong Kong Epoch Times.
In the past few months, the Epoch Times New Tang Dynasty reporters have adhered to the anti-delivery scene, and have a first-line live broadcast every weekend and major events; in addition to interviewing Hong Kong officials, experts, scholars, social workers, stars and young protesters, they have also connected to Hong Kong. Commentators, and sent reporters to report on the front line. The first time to report the Hong Kong frontline, through the satellite TV, cable TV, newspapers, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and other platforms, quickly passed to the international community.
At the same time, the Epoch Times New Tang Dynasty people are deeply saddened by the need for Hong Kong young people to be guilty of crimes. They have also witnessed the arrogance of the young people in Hong Kong in the face of threats of violence and the bravery of never shrinking. ""Junior Hong Kong"" is the hope of the future of China.


On September 19th, Sha Tin, Hong Kong held a joint school chain activity to express the anti-delivery appeal. The scene was huge. (Yugang / Epoch)


The CCP’s gangs are governing the country.

It is well known throughout the world that the CCP is not only a dictatorial dictator, but also a large and kitsch national machine. Orwell's ""1984"", the fake news brainwashing and the temperament of destroying political enemies at no cost, is being staged in Hong Kong, targeting tens of thousands of students, and an important indicator of whether the country can move towards a prosperous future.
In modern times, ""the pioneer of reform"" Liang Qichao has the ""Juvenile China Theory"", pointing to the ""juvenile"" who can create the future is the cornerstone of China's progress:
""Youth is wisdom, the country is rich, the young is rich, the country is rich; the young is strong, the country is strong, the young is independent, the country is independent; the young is free, the country is free; the young is progressing, the country is progressing; the younger is better than Europe, the country is better than Europe; the young is stronger than the earth. , the country is on the earth.""
However, the CCP is exporting violence to Hong Kong, using the means of gangs to rule the country, and unscrupulously suppressing the juveniles who can bring prosperity to China, trying to knock them down with an axe and harvesting valuable young souls with a sickle.
In the autumn of crisis, a group of young girls have been steadfastly guarding the front line. The moved Hong Kong people spontaneously handed out real information and videos to the outside world, and used the White House website to initiate a petition, which is a big deal. The Hong Kong people of the CCP have shown the most solid and valuable spirit of freedom to the outside world and the Chinese mainland at the most dangerous moment.

National education brainwashing

On October 13, the Epoch Times reported that Fan Shiping, a professor at the Institute of Politics of Taiwan Normal University, attended the ""Strait Forum"" and talked about the fact that Hong Kong people have turned from disappointment to anger against the Chinese government, but now it is tragic.
This tragic atmosphere is rooted in the blame because the young people in Hong Kong did not intend to achieve heroes, but they were forced into the Liangshan by tyranny. Whether it is ""and Li Fei"" or ""Yongwu School"", they are forced to come forward, instead of automatically picking up the mask, putting on a black shirt, and putting the suicide note in their pockets.
The white people screamed at the demonstrators, the Hong Kong police posing as protesters, the PLA posing as a Hong Kong police, and so on. They were repeatedly shocked in Hong Kong, and the world was shocked: no one wants the CCP to use the hooligans of mainland activists in Hong Kong.

This kind of governance by the government and the people, as the Epoch Times senior investigator Joshua Philipp wrote:
""In today's totalitarian system, the people's rights are given by the government, not the other way. Under such a premise, there is no space for the existence of natural human rights, and there is no existence of a creator outside the government. The happiness of the people is based on money and Indulging in sensuality rather than virtue, the general public is considered too stupid to be free.""
The early national education became the brainwashing education of the party culture. It also clearly reflected that the CCP is concentrating on young people in Hong Kong, letting them become accustomed to loving the party and patriotic thinking mode from an early age, and finally cultivated a ""useful idiot"" in Lenin's mouth.

Porn violence strikes Hong Kong, what is the personality of youth?

In addition to brainwashing education, the CCP continues to infect young people in Hong Kong through violence and pornography exported by the Hong Kong government.
Even though Lin Zhengyue has withdrawn the amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, the cases of ""suicides"" such as ""jumping the sea with blood and jumping from the building without blood"" are still frequent, and there are also unacceptable police use of sexual violence against demonstrators.
On September 28, the Epoch Times reported that a demonstrator disclosed through a gathering at the Edinburgh Place in Central that he was detained in the Xinwuling detention center and was tied up with limbs, wearing a hood and being sexually assaulted by at least two police officers. Torture abuse.
The demonstrator said, ""I believe that I am not the only one who has been tortured and sexually abused.""

On October 10th, Wu Aoxue, a female student of the Chinese University of China, stepped forward and took off her mask. She accused the police of harassing her and explained that some young people who had been arrested in the Xinwuling detention center suffered from unbearable sexual assault and Ill.
On the next day, Chen Yanlin, a 15-year-old female student who was involved in the reversal. She was good at diving. After many days of disappearance, she was floating in the sea. The police said that she committed suicide by ""no doubt."" However, the deceased was deeply hydrated during his lifetime, but his body was naked when he died. Police testimony and abnormally active fishing movements raised doubts.
In the ""Looking Surprise"" program, the New Tang Dynasty reporter Da Yu pointed out that Chen Yanlin was followed by the police during his lifetime, and he was crying emotionally, but he did not forget to shoot the film to encourage other demonstrators. He also yelled at the Hong Kong police: ""Be born, died in Sri Lanka, Why do Hong Kong people have to be Hong Kong people?""

The CCP is bound to die, the young Hong Kong is on the high wall.

On Saturday, October 12, the ""Anti-Emergency Law Parade"" started in the rain at 3 pm. The people on the scene shouted ""Recovering the Hong Kong Revolution"", ""Hong Kong people resisting"", ""I have the right to wear a mask"", ""masked not guilty"" Legislation is unreasonable.
A large number of Hong Kong people are not afraid to protest. They sang ""Glory to Hong Kong"" along the way, and the people took the slogan ""National Anti-Communist Anti-Peace"".

On the way, Hong Kong Epoch Times reporter Liang Zhen visited a C student who had been beaten by the police. Can Hong Kong be held by young people?
""I think we can protect Hong Kong. Because we have, not just people, there is a strong belief. So I think that even if you hurt all of us, how many people are killing us? Our belief, our philosophy still exists, will never be eliminated, will not be suppressed by any resistance,"" C said.
Epoch Times reporter Fang Tianliang reported in Hong Kong that the reason why these young people came out was not politically instigated, but because they ""had no trade-offs, no human concerns, no family shackles.""
""Many young people say that this is a major event concerning the survival of Hong Kong. It is a matter of safeguarding Hong Kong's values. It is a matter of good and evil. There is no middle ground. Even if eggs hit the wall, they have to rush out."" Fang Tianliang wrote.
The report mentioned that Wang Hua, who had participated in the ""June 4th"" democracy movement in 1989, wrote that the young people who were at the forefront of the fight in Hong Kong were like the companions who were killed by the CCP. They are now reborn from Beijing to Hong Kong with the aim of completing their unfinished mission.
