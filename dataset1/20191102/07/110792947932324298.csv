The first five-story building was declared emergency in Astrakhan | WATERMELON
On Bumazhnikov Avenue

An unprecedented event. For the first time in Astrakhan, not a wooden hut or a building of the last century, not a half-abandoned dormitory, but an ordinary five-story residential building was recognized as emergency and demolished. This was announced by the deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Oleg Shein.
The parliamentarian said that this is a house at 14. Bumazhnikov Avenue. This five-story building was built in 1966, that is, about the same years as the majority of Astrakhan Khrushchev. According to the deputy, the reason why other houses of the same age are normal, and this one began to collapse, is commonplace - ""nobody needed anything in the house.""
The reason for recognizing the house as emergency was the appearance of vertical cracks. They, in turn, arose due to the fact that a roof leaked in the building for several years, but it was not stubbornly repaired. The residents of the house, according to the deputy, instead of taking a logical step and changing the management company, they simply wrote complaints. No one opened a special account for overhaul, and if there was a fee of 500 thousand rubles, they did not repair the roof.
In this regard, everyone Oleg Shein called on residents of other similar houses to create house councils and closely monitor the spending of money that they themselves pay for the maintenance and repair of housing. ‚ÄúIf someone thinks that [residents of an emergency home] will quickly get new apartments, he is very mistaken,‚Äù the deputy stressed.
According to information from the database, from March 2015 to March 2019, this house was managed by ZhEK-2 LLC. There is currently no information about home management.

Craftiness. In our country, when there was still no common house property, since those very years, we were only involved in patching holes. In houses where basements stood for years in the water, where there were fires, pipes and batteries burst, glass was broken in corridors and in winter the walls were covered with a crust of ice, there would be no sense in patching roofs.
Yes, that there is a management company, that it is not. Mom lives on Nemova 28 Bldg. 1. There is still no normal heating, the batteries have just not been icy. The housewife said that this is as it should be, it‚Äôs all about the stoker. And so every year. All the pipes in the basement are rotten and flowing.
According to the logic of the esteemed deputy, the residents are to blame for everything! Who wrote complaints, but they were ignored, including the administration of the Trusovsky district. And the fact that ZhEK regularly receiving money from bona fide tenants did nothing, it‚Äôs normal and non-jurisdictional. Just well done deputy, he thought of it?
It‚Äôs good that you, Oleg Shein, were not elected governor of the Astrakhan region. Too many words and little deed. Grandmother is a completely different person.
Until the ""renovation"" of housing in the style of Moscow begins, Astrakhan will be famous all over the world for its miserable rotten üôÅA naturally, such renovation will not happen ...
That is a special account? Money was dripping to overhaul and still the bills are coming! Oleg Vasilyevich, what are you talking about? Someone asks you to insert your five cents? According to your words, the tenants of the house had a secret intention, they directly slept, they saw the house recognized as emergency, so that they could get new apartments ??? And then the people do not know how in Astrakhan they quickly give people housing? Opinion about you has fallen sharply ...
