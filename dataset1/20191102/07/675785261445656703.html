      <h1>Liverpool predicted lineup vs Aston Villa as Mohamed Salah to start despite ankle issue</h1>
      <h2>Jurgen Klopp's men look to continue their unbeaten run against Dean Smith's side at Villa Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T07:00:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> look to continue their unbeaten start to the Premier League season when they face Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>The Reds are six points clear of champions <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> after nine wins from their opening 10 Premier League matches.</p>
      <p>Mohamed Salah's penalty at Anfield last Sunday was enough to secure another three points with a 2-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> Hotspur.</p>
      <p>But the Kop's Egyptian hero continues to nurse an ankle problem, the lasting effects of Hamza Choudhury's challenge in the win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> last month which so infuriated Jurgen Klopp.</p>

      <p>Salah has followed a tailored fitness plan during the past week, training away from the rest of the first team before Friday.</p>
      <p>However, he is set to start in the West Midlands against the Villans.</p>
      <p>"He should be fine," said Klopp. "He has had to do his individual stuff but he will be in training (on Friday).</p>
      <p>“I think it is more really annoying - for him, not me - the fact that the injury always has a bit of fluid in, and he has to deal with it, we get it out and it comes back, and stuff like that.</p>
      <p>“But this is not a real injury in this sense, so I’ve heard ( from the physios), so he should be fine."</p>

      <p>The biggest decision for Klopp involves his midfield, with Fabinho set to be only a substitute at Villa Park; the Brazilian is one booking away from a suspension, which would rule him out of the City clash.</p>
      <p>As such, Jordan Henderson is set to play in the deeper role, with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain starting alongside</p>
      <p>Villa are set to have captain Jack Grealish available, after he missed their League Cup win over local rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> .</p>
      <p>Grealish is set to start as part of the front three once more, having been pushed further forward by boss Dean Smith in recent weeks.</p>
      <p><b>Liverpool predicted XI:</b> Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Wijnaldum, Oxlade-Chamberlain; Salah, Firmino, Mane</p>
