      <h1>Rugby World Cup prize money: How much England will pocket with 2019 Final victory</h1>
      <h2>There is a lucrative bonus system on offer to England players for the Rugby World Cup 2019</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T07:42:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 07:42</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/</a></address>
      <p>England players are set to pocket £2.5million between them if they win the Rugby World Cup.</p>
      <p>The Red Rose take on South Africa in Saturday morning's showpiece event, looking to avenge the 2007 loss at the same stage to the same opposition.</p>
      <p>Rugby chiefs have handed England a mammoth financial incentive for victory, with the bonus payouts thought to be the largest ever on offer for a Test match.</p>
      <p>It comes on top of the £1.2m payout that England players bagged for beating New Zealand in the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>The prize money comes as part of a laddering system, with England earning more money for each knockout round that they progress.</p>

      <p>A bonus payment of £768,150 was distributed between the squad for beating Australia in the quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>That then went up to £1.2m for the New Zealand game - and now has more than doubled for victory in the final.</p>
      <p>Nothing additional will be paid to England players if they fail to beat South Africa.</p>
      <p>It means that every member of the England squad has already taken home £66,077 for their exploits in the knockout stages alone.</p>
      <p>There was a payment of £13,656 per player for the group games.</p>
      <p>If England are to go on to win the World Cup, it will mean that almost £7million will have been paid out to the England squad in total throughout the competition - approximately £225,000 per player.</p>
      <p>From the World Cup itself, a fee of £325,000 is paid out to the winning nation.</p>
