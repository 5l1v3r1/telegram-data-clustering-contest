Fem personer drept og flere såret i skyting på halloweenfest i USA
En femte person er død etter å ha blitt skutt på en halloweenfest med over 100 deltakere i California i USA. Så langt er ingen pågrepet.

Festen fant sted i et hus som en kvinne hadde leid via Airbnb i byen Orinda. Ifølge eieren hadde kvinnen opplyst at hun leide huset til tolv familiemedlemmer med astmaproblemer, som trengte å komme seg vekk fra røyk fra skogbrannene som herjer deler av California for tiden.
I stedet ble det arrangert halloweenfest i huset torsdag kveld med mer enn 100 personer til stede, og i 23-tiden begynte skytingen.
Tre personer ble funnet døde på stedet, mens en fjerde person døde på sykehuset. De fire drepte var i alderen 22 til 29 år. Ytterligere fire personer ble såret, en av dem kritisk. Det lokale politiet bekreftet sent fredag kveld at en 19-åring døde på sykehus av skadene som hun fikk under skytingen. Dermed er fem personer blitt drept i halloween-skytingen.
Uklare omstendigheter
Mange av festdeltakerne flyktet fra stedet da skytingen begynte.
Motivet for skytingen, nøyaktig hva som skjedde eller hvem som kan ha stått bak, er fremdeles uklart. Lørdag morgen norsk tid var ennå ingen pågrepet i saken. Politiet opplyser at det ble funnet to skytevåpen på stedet, og at politiet forsøker å komme i kontakt med dem som deltok på festen.
Flere skyteepisoder
Den siste uken har det vært flere lignende hendelser i USA. Onsdag ble tre personer skutt og drept og ni såret på en halloweenfest i Long Beach i Los Angeles-området. To personer ble drept på en universitetsfest i Greenville i USA søndag der ytterligere tolv personer ble såret.
I Chicago ble en sju år gammel jente kritisk såret da hun ble skutt i halsen torsdag kveld. Hennes far ble skutt i en hånd. De var ute på en tradisjonell «knask eller knep»-runde. En 15 år gammel gutt ble pågrepet. Jenta og hennes far var utilsiktede ofre og hadde tilsynelatende havnet i skuddlinjen for et oppgjør, har politiet opplyst.

The road to Trump's impeachment for the dem is all uphill
The Chamber has initiated the procedure to indict the president on the Ukraine case. But it will be judged by the Senate, where the majority is in the hands of the Republicans
02 Nov 2019, 07:00 by Nuccia Bianchini
The US House of Congress made its first concrete step in the impeachment procedure against President Donald Trump on the Ucrainagate case on Thursday: he established the impeachment roadmap, with televised public hearings, which could lead to a vote as well before the end of the year.
The House of Representatives, controlled by the Democrats, will have the right to charge him, the Senate to judge him. But given the Republican majority in the Senate that will have the last word, the removal of the president seems unlikely.
In summary, what you need to know to understand the investigation that will determine whether Trump abused his power for voter purposes in his contacts with Ukraine.
What the Constitution says
The American Constitution provides for the removal of the president (but also of the deputy or other public officials, including judges) in the case of ""treason, corruption and other serious crimes and crimes"". The latter term, which comes from the tradition of British 'common law', used for centuries in London to remove Crown officials, indicates the abuse of power by a public official, and does not necessarily constitute a violation of a rule criminal.
Public hearings and more rights for Trump
Six parliamentary committees will continue to investigate President Trump, and if the results are considered sufficient, the 'ball' will be voted by the House of Representatives. From now on, the testimonies in the Justice Commission can be public and broadcast live on TV and the transcripts of the testimonies made behind closed doors can also be published. Trump's lawyers will be able to participate in the hearings and Republicans will be able to summon their witnesses (even if they will first have to obtain the majority's permission in the Justice Commission, controlled by the Democrats).
The vote of the Chamber and the Senate
The House of Representatives, which has a democratic majority, will be called to vote (on one or more articles). A simple majority is enough and, in the event of a vote for impeachment, Trump will be put under indictment. At that point the political process will move to the Senate, which is currently controlled by the Republicans: the vote in the Senate requires a two-thirds majority.
Note that in the Senate, the trial 'will be overseen by the chief of justice of the United States, the president of the Supreme Court: a team of deputies, the' managers', will act as prosecutors, the president will have his defense lawyers, and the Senate will act as jury. As mentioned, at least two thirds of the senators are needed to judge the guilty president, and therefore remove him; and at that point - but it is unlikely given the majority the Gop has in the Senate - the vice president, in this case Mike Pence, will become president. No appeal is foreseen.
An uncertain calendar
Two weeks ago, both the Democrats and the Republicans hoped to conclude their investigations in the 'Lower House' by Thanksgiving on November 28th. The Republican majority leader in the US Senate, Mitch McConnell, had calculated that this would allow him to immediately start the political process and finish it before Christmas. But the growing number of witnesses who are accepting to appear has complicated the picture and now the Democrats believe that their investigations will go beyond Thanksgiving, which could shift the political process in January or even later, intertwining with the electoral campaign for the 2020 presidential elections.
The electoral factor
If the political process were called in January, it would coincide with the campaign for democratic primaries, which begins with the Iowa caucuses on 3 February. This would make it difficult for six senators running for the Democratic nomination - Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet - to campaign in Iowa and other key states. It would also give an advantage to candidates who are not in the Senate, such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Secretary for Housing, Julian Castro.
Previous
In American history only two presidents, Andrew Johnson, in 1868 and Bill Clinton, in 1998, were put on political trial, and both were eventually acquitted and completed their term. Overwhelmed by the Watergate, Richard Nixon instead resigned in 1974 to avoid being put on trial.
And the public opinion?
Few people in Washington think that the impeachment process can succeed in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority is needed and Republicans control 53 of the 100 seats. If public opinion were favorable, it would be more difficult for Republican senators to justify their support for the president. And this explains the interest of the Democrats in broadcasting the hearings of their investigations on television.
But for now the challenge seems far from easy: according to a survey average by FiveThirtyEight, only 48% of Americans currently support the opening of a political trial in Trump. And the party alignment is decisive: 84% of the Democratic voters are in favor compared to 11% of the Republicans.
