Инцидент случился днём на улице Новостроек. Местные жители обнаружили, что в открытый канализационный коллектор упала собака. Самостоятельно вытащить животное горожане не могли. На помощь люди вызвали спасателей. Благодаря верёвке хвостатого удалось достать с 6-метровой глубины. Четырёхлапого пережали благодарной хозяйке.

Five people killed and several injured in the shooting at a Halloween party in the United States
A fifth person has died after being shot at a Halloween party with over 100 participants in California, USA. So far no one has been arrested.

The party took place in a house a woman had rented via Airbnb in the city of Orinda. According to the owner, the woman had stated that she was renting the house to twelve family members with asthma problems, who needed to get away from smoke from the forest fires currently ravaging parts of California.
Instead, a Halloween party was held in the house on Thursday night with more than 100 people in attendance, and at 23 the shooting began.
Three people were found dead at the scene, while a fourth person died at the hospital. The four killed were aged between 22 and 29 years. Another four people were injured, one of them critical. Local police confirmed late Friday night that a 19-year-old died in hospital from the injuries she sustained during the shooting. Thus, five people have been killed in the Halloween shooting.
Unclear circumstances
Many of the party members fled the scene when the shooting began.
The motive for the shooting, exactly what happened or who may have been behind, is still unclear. Saturday morning Norwegian time was not yet arrested in the case. Police say two firearms were found at the scene and police are trying to get in touch with those attending the party.
More shooting episodes
This past week there have been several similar incidents in the US. On Wednesday, three people were shot and killed and nine injured at a Halloween party in Long Beach, Los Angeles. Two people were killed at a university party in Greenville, USA on Sunday, where another twelve people were injured.
In Chicago, a seven-year-old girl was critically injured when she was shot in the throat Thursday night. Her father was shot in the hand. They were out on a traditional ""crap or trick"" round. A 15 year old boy was arrested. The girl and her father were accidental victims and had apparently ended up in the firing line for a settlement, police have said.
