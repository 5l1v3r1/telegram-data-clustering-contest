Arsenal return to Premier League action for the first time since Granit Xhaka’s extraordinary outburst.
But one week on from his expletive-ridden rant, Xhaka will not be in the squad to take on Wolves at the Emirates.
Xhaka sat out of the Carabao Cup thriller with Liverpool on Wednesday night and again will not play a part as Arsenal return to league duties.
Standing in Arsenal’s way are Wolves, who have had an upturn in form following a difficult start to the season.
Here is all you need to know ahead of the game…
