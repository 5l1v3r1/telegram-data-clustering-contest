Suspected ""Tung Oil"" Accelerates Shuri Castle Fire 15 Seconds Camera Becomes a Mystery

02 Nov 2019, 07:51

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] Japan’s Okinawa Prefecture has a world cultural heritage in Shuri Castle. On the morning of the 31st, a fire broke out and the fire broke out. The fire broke out and destroyed seven buildings including the main hall. A 15-second fire-burning image that appeared to be close-up shot was hot on the Internet, causing Japanese netizens to talk about it. In addition, experts said that the reason why the fire was so fast was that it might be related to the use of ""tung oil"" and the lack of fire-fighting equipment in the red paint of the Shuri Castle.
In the Shuri Castle fire, this seemingly close-up image was taken in the ""Yu Ting"" (the square between the Shenmen Gate and the main hall) in the city. The length was about 15 seconds, except for the main hall and the south hall. The picture of the North Hall was ravaged and saw a figure with a megaphone object in the mirror.



According to the judgment of the scene, people who can be so close to the fire, only a few related personnel such as firefighters and Shuricheng management units, but the firefighting units and security personnel denied that the image was taken by them.
The head of the Naha City Fire Department in Okinawa saw the film and said that the roof of the main hall of the film had not been dropped. It was supposed to be taken between 2:30 and 3 am, when the firefighters were busy extinguishing the fire. ""Not shooting."" The timing of images or photos, denied by firefighters. It is said that the firefighters started shooting the relevant pictures about 11 o'clock in the morning after the fire was controlled.
The security company in charge of Shuri Castle also said that the security personnel did not take this image.
This time I don't know who shot the image, and people can't figure out where the image comes from.

The fire was quickly burned, and the suspected tung oil and fire fighting equipment were insufficient.

The Okinawa Times reported that the current fire point in Shuri Castle was in the main hall, but the main hall was locked by the security personnel at 1:43 am local time on October 31, and no signs of external force intrusion were found. The Okinawa police investigated the arson. The possibility is not high.
When the fire broke out, the security personnel wanted to use the three fire water guns set up next to the main hall to extinguish the fire. However, because the fire temperature was too high, they could not get close. The fire curtain under the roof of the main hall was activated, but only on the outside of the building. Sprinkling water, can not suppress the flames in the temple for the first time.
As a result, the fire was so rapidly burned, experts judged that if there were automatic sprinklers in the building, almost no burning would occur; the fire hydrant was set indoors, causing fire hydrants to be used after the fire; fire alarm The use of equipment that does not affect the appearance of monuments, but the slow response may be the reason for the rapid spread of the fire.
The ""Cultural Assets Preservation Technology Association"", which is responsible for the preservation and restoration of cultural assets, said that the deep red appearance of the main hall of the Shuri Castle is characteristic of it. The red paint uses Okinawa's unique ""tung oil"" (from The oil extracted from the tung tree seeds can not be eaten. Although the ancient buildings on the island of Japan will be painted, only Okinawa will use tung oil. The fire in the first city will be quickly burned. ""This oil may be one of the reasons.""
Naha City Fire Department Director Shimako Hiroki also said that once the lacquered building is on fire, it is not so simple to extinguish the fire, and the radiant heat of the fire field is too strong. Firefighters who spray water outside the main hall must go backwards to avoid secondary disasters; Also, because the radiant heat is very strong, even wood that is far away from the fire source spontaneously ignites due to temperature rise.
Tokyo University of Science professor Ogata Hiran, who specializes in building fire protection engineering, said that the large space that is made of wood and cannot be used in wall partitions should be the reason for the rapid spread of fire.
According to the record of the state-run Okinawa Memorial Park office that was responsible for repairing the Shuri Castle project, there is an indoor fire hydrant in the main hall of Shuri Castle where fire hoses can be used, but Omiya said that when such a large fire occurs inside, people simply do not enter. Go, you can not use this fire hydrant.
In addition, the fire alarm of the main hall uses an ""air tube"" for detecting thermal expansion. The advantage is that it does not affect the appearance of the monument. The disadvantage is that the reaction is slightly slow. Omiya said that the original equipment may not be used to destroy the overall landscape.
Although there is a fire water curtain on the outside of the building, it can be sprayed with water to form a curtain to prevent the fire from prolonging, but the result is extended to the South Hall and the North Hall.
