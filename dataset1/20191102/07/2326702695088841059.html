      <p><a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/blizzcon">Blizzcon 2019</a> is currently underway and given the widely negative reception they received last year, many believed that Blizzard was going to come out swinging big time this year!</p>
      <h3>Blizzcon 2019</h3>
      <p>So, one day in, how are they doing? Well, quite frankly, they haven’t disappointed. In what may represent the biggest Blizzcon ever, <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/blizzard">Blizzard</a> has announced Overwatch 2, Diablo 4, World of Warcraft Shadowlands and even some new Hearthstone content!</p>
      <p>Let’s check out some of those glorious <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/trailer">trailers</a>!</p>
      <h3>Overwatch 2</h3>

      <p>I must admit that while I had more than an inkling that Overwatch 2 was in production, I didn’t expect it to be announced at this year’s Blizzcon. I personally thought it would be next year. Particularly since most people were expecting Diablo IV and possibly the expectation that this would’ve been enough from Blizzard to keep everyone happy.</p>
      <p>I’m not complaining though. Overwatch 2 is on the way and based on the trailer, perhaps we’re going to get some new mechanics in terms of ultimate abilities combining.</p>
      <h3>Diablo IV</h3>

      <p>The one that we all expected <i>is indeed</i> on the way! Admittedly, it would’ve been tantamount to suicide for Blizzard not to have announced this game given the <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/diablo-4-leak-suggests-darker-and-grittier-tone/">hugely negative reception they saw over Diablo Immortal last year</a>.</p>
      <p>If this trailer is anything to go by, however, Diablo IV is looking pretty amazing!</p>
      <h3>World of Warcraft Shadowlands</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Again, I wasn’t necessarily expecting the announcement of (yet another) <a href="https://youtu.be/1jAEklatuV0">World of Warcraft</a> expansion, but based on this trailer its certainly giving us some solid fan service.</p>
      <p>We get to see Sylvannas fight Bolvar Fordragon (the latest Lich King whom, the last we saw, we’d all presumed was happy being a perpetual popsicle). Alas, it seems his sacrifice was for nought as he lost the crown and, indeed, has seen it shattered exposing a whole new world!</p>
      <p>I’ll happily admit, this trailer is by far my favourite of the bunch. Even if I have no intention of playing this expansion.</p>
      <h3>Hearthstone Decent of Dragons</h3>

      <p>While I’ve never actually played Hearthstone, I do understand its attraction. Perhaps most interesting, however, is to see Blizzard pushing it quite hard again.</p>
      <p>If Hearthstone isn’t, however, your thing the trailer has a pretty awesome song that reminds me (more than a little) of Flash Gordon. Maybe that’s just me…</p>
      <h3>Anything Else?</h3>

      <p>While all of these announcements are certainly pretty awesome, and definitely have some amazing trailers to accompany them, I still think that Blizzard may have one card left up their sleeve with the Warcraft 3 remake.</p>
      <p>To be honest, as amazingly happy as I am to see Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4, I’m still holding out hope that this will get a confirmed release date. Fingers crossed, one for this year.</p>
      <p>We will, of course, keep you posted with all of the latest Blizzcon news. For now, however, this is more than enough to digest!</p>
      <p>What do you think? Which is your favourite trailer? – Let us know in the comments!</p>
