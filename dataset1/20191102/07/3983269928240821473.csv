A Blantyre minister who was never a fan of diet clubs is now singing their praises.

Now she is inspiring other ministers to lose weight and has been overwhelmed by the backing of her congregation.
The 43-year-old, who started her weight loss journey weighing 13st 12.5lbs, has now slimmed down to 9st 13lbs, a weight she has not seen in 25 years.
Sarah explained: “As someone in the public eye, having my sparkle back is important, being able to be confident yet gentle, creative, innovative and full of energy.
“Now I know I am honouring my life – a gift given to me, and only I can treasure this gift.
“I now run 5km three times a week, and sometimes 10km. I am fitter and healthier and make much more effort to eat healthier.

“I completed my first 10km race in June 2019, something I have always wanted to do, but was never fit or confident enough. I have also just started netball for the first time since high school and I am loving it.”
Church of Scotland minister Sarah has a congregation of over 100, and their support has been appreciated.
She explained: “Often, I have been asked if I am well and losing weight on purpose.
“Perhaps in my line of work, sudden weight loss is the sign of something else. I never intended to be an inspiration to others, at least it was never my goal.
“Now the irony is that as someone who didn’t like diet clubs, I am singing the praises of WW.
“I deal with requests for information from colleagues and friends, and I’m happy to have pointed a few in the right direction.”
Sarah made her decision to lose weight as a New Year resolution for 2019.
She added: “The latter part of 2018 had been very challenging due to a traumatic event in my work.
“It had affected my confidence, and I hit a very low point in my mood and sense of self. Despite being a minister and a person of faith, I found myself going through the motions.
“Christmas, a season that normally I love, did very little for me. Of course, there were highlights, and I think the highlights showed me how far I had fallen from my bright, optimistic, hopeful self.
“With the beginning of a new year, an opportunity to start a new chapter, make resolutions and make 2019 my year I decided to take back my life. I sent a message to my friend Danielle asking her to join me in doing the Couchto5K app.
“Running, something I never thought I could do, was something I had dipped in and out of through previous years, but my general fitness levels were poor. She agreed she would support me if I would join her at WW. I didn’t have any confidence in diet classes, but being a fair person at heart, I felt I couldn’t make her do my challenge and not do hers.
“So, reluctantly I went to the first workshop with Danni to Calderwood Community Centre, where honestly, I felt like I was in a strange universe. I had to work hard to swallow my cynicism, but the coach Christine Fleming was very welcoming, and Danni held my hand, not literally, but I know there is not a chance I would have walked in myself.
“Since that first workshop, I haven’t missed one, unless I was on holiday, and now count all the members as friends. Sharing the journey with Danni, Christine and others at 8am on a Saturday morning has been worth it.”

Quartararo continues unstoppable and Marc Márquez suffers a violent fall
The young Frenchman heads the domain of the Yamaha while Márquez will leave from eleventh position if he passes the medical tests
02 Nov 2019, 07:34 by esport3
As demonstrated in the free training sessions, Fabio Quartararo has taken the measure taken in the Sepang circuit in such a way that he has achieved the ""pole position"" of the Malaysian Grand Prix of MotoGP and has also lowered another hit, record the circuit. The Yamaha Petronas rider celebrates this way confirming that next season he will have an official motorcycle in the circuit from where his main sponsor comes from.
Quartararo is shown running at home and partly because the layout of Sepang adapts much better to the Yamaha than to the other bikes. So much so that the brand of the tuning fork has monopolized the first line. Secondly, Maverick Viñales, the author of a great qualifying session only eclipsed by the Quartararo phenomenon, will be leaving, Franco Morbidelli completes the exit list. You have to go to the fourth place, where there is the Ducati of Andrea Dovizioso, to find a motorcycle other than a Yamaha.
Marc Márquez, already crowned world champion, has been in trouble. A violent fall when trying to approach the times of Quartararo has limited its participation and has left it in a discreet eleventh place. The best news for Cerverí, however, is that it has not suffered serious consequences as a result of its spectacular fall. However, he has traumatisms on both knees and sore shoulders, and he will have to pass medical tests this Sunday before the race to see if they declare it fit to run.
In addition to Maverick Viñales, there is another Catalan among the top 10: Àlex Rins, who will be out of seventh position with his Suzuki.
