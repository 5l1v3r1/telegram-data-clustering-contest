TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran has unveiled new murals painted on exterior walls of the former U.S. Embassy in Tehran ahead of the 40th anniversary of the 1979 takeover of the embassy.
Among the paintings is a depiction of the Statue of Liberty with a cut-off arm and the shooting down of a U.S. drone, which is illustrated with bats flying out of it. They can be seen by drivers and pedestrians passing by.
Iran will commemorate the 40th anniversary of the U.S. Embassy takeover on Monday by staging a rally in front of the compound.
The embassy in downtown Tehran remains frozen in time since 1979, when revolutionary students took over the compound after Washington allowed ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to leave the country and travel to the U.S. for medical treatment.

Israeli General Says Gaza Development Boosts ‘Terror’

02 Nov 2019, 07:30

The head of the Israeli Southern Command, Maj. Gen. Herzi Halevi, has warned that the economic development of the Gaza Strip could lead to increased terror. ""You have to show us that Gaza's economic development does not lead to the development of terrorist capabilities,"" Halevi told representatives of the World Zionist Organization at the Gaza Division.“When terrorist capabilities develop - then there will be war.”The Israeli army is “very strong,” he said.“The stronger the capabilities in Gaza are, the stronger will be the force that we will have to exert. And then we will take Gaza, once again, very much backwards in time,"" he added.Halevi’s remarks were a clear sign of Israel’s rejection to end the blockade on Gaza to end the suffering of its people. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, poverty has risen to 53 percent and unemployment to 80 percent in Gaza.The UN Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, said in May that more than half of Gaza’s population depends on food aid from the international community.Some 620,000 abject poor cannot cover their basic food needs and have to survive on $1.6 per day, it added.
