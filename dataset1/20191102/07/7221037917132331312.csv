Palestinian killed in Israeli air strikes on 'wide range' of Hamas targets
02 Nov 2019, 07:50 by Agence France-Presse

The Israeli army said the raids were in response to at least 10 rockets being fired at Israel from Gaza on Friday

A Palestinian was killed by Israeli air strikes on Saturday, the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip said, in an attack launched in response to rocket fire.
Dozens of strikes hit the Palestinian enclave in the early hours, targeting bases of the strip’s Islamist rulers and allied groups, a security source in Gaza said.
The Israeli army said the strikes targeted “a wide range of Hamas terror targets”, including a Hamas naval site, a military compound and a weapons manufacturing site.
One person was killed, the health ministry in Gaza said, naming him as Ahmed al-Shehri, 27. It did not say whether he was affiliated with any faction.
The sound of explosions could be heard up and down the impoverished territory, an AFP correspondent said.
A Hamas source said they had fired at the Israeli aircraft carrying out the raids, and the Israeli army confirmed fresh “incoming fire” from Gaza.
The strikes came in response to at least 10 rockets fired from Gaza late on Friday at southern Israel.
The Israeli army said the country’s Iron Dome anti-missile defence system intercepted eight of the rockets. The rockets were fired in waves, it said, with air raid sirens sounding. One house was hit and damaged, without any casualties, the army said, posting a picture of the damage on Twitter.
It was the second consecutive evening that the army reported rocket fire from the Palestinian enclave. Before Thursday, there had been no such reported rocket fire from Gaza since September 12.
In August, a series of rocket attacks from Gaza and Israeli retaliations, as well as border clashes, raised fears of an escalation between Hamas and Israel, as elections approached in the Jewish state. Those polls – Israel’s second elections this year – took place on 17 September but have yet to yield a new government.
Israel and Hamas have fought three wars in the Palestinian enclave since 2008.

Erdal Beşikçioğlu: The artist is always hungry and never gets enough and becomes a merchant when he is satisfied
Erdal Beşikçioğlu is becoming more and more giant on stage with his phenomenal acting, charisma and intellectuality. He said ”Hello una to the theater season this year with the play ina Nina an inspired by Chekhov's immortal‘ Seagull ‘.

02 Nov 2019, 07:36

He is accompanied by his wife Elvin Beşikçioğlu and experienced actress Ünsal Coşar.
Erdal Beşikçioğlu answered the questions of Oya Çınar from Posta:
‘You have brought the three main characters of Seagull to the stage. Your wife Elvan Beşikçioğlu plays the main character karakter
Yes, there are three characters we know in Gull. Trigorin, Treplev and Nina. There is a question of revolution and existence through the love triangle in Seagull.
After the Bolshevik Revolution of 1914, it is a somewhat strange and complex story about the effect of the process on human beings. But of course, it includes the brutal effects of war and war on human psychology, as well as the comic elements of the period and events.

How did the idea come about? Why this game?

The idea of playing some plays for the audience is very naive, and when you find them, you want to get them into your repertoire. ‘Nina di was one of the plays that matched the aesthetic perception and worldview of the Exercise Stage. The work was also very enjoyable.

How do you explain the world view of the Exercise Stage?

The Exercise Stage has the energy to diagnose the system's symptoms first and then to solve its own problems.
I won't be with you when I'm so mean to myself?

People have a mixed admiration for you. That's the common idea of most people I know. What do you think makes people feel like that?

Could be my indifference (Laughing). I'm a person who tells me what I see and think without bending. This may be hard for some people. People do not like to be seen and expressed their shortcomings. When I look at where they stand, I might be a little bit wrong with them. But this is a natural process for me.

So it should be…

Exactly! For example, if I don't tell the man on the stage, that man will correct himself! Excuse me, I'm being so cruel to myself, won't I? Anyway, it's easy to get in touch with me when you cross this threshold, but if you don't, you get a strange feeling mixed with fear.

Every character you play has entered our daily lives. Can this be explained by just being a good player?

I love my profession and I am very sincere. It could be ... I'm not interested in the concept of good and bad. I'm interested in the energies and timings that affect me. I'm interested in what's interesting.
The work must tell the truth

When do you object to your work? What are your indispensable ethical rules?

There is a lot, but in the beginning it has to tell the truth and tell the truth. It's supposed to be a targeted job. His word must be clear, not to go around the subject.
I'm performing my act on the stage.

“I'm not a revolutionary, I'm not an activist. Devrim You said that my revolutionism starts when the camera says‘ three two one ... ...

My field is theater. I have an area where I share my ideology, my truths, and the errors that I draw from the system. I'm expressing this issue with my audience in that area.
Like a bureaucrat or a politician, I don't like moving it to another platform. Where necessary, I already exhibit the necessary words and behavior on my stage. So I perform my action on stage, in the cinema
A theater actor and any actor's perception of life is not the same

For 13 years, you've been playing the box office of a madman's memo book, and there are people who haven't wanted to go and find tickets for years. What exactly does this person do to his ego?

The ego of the theater is something that gets better when you share it. There is no negative result. ""Oh! How nice ... There are guys who think like me. Orum The perception of life of a person who is a theater actor may not be the same as the perception of any actor in the media. But the system on the TV is completely different and I'm not interested in it at all.

Doesn't that ego go into the street, into everyday life?

I don't think it's overflowing. I'm just a neighborhood brother on the street. But of course things change when you get into the workspace. Keep in mind how clean the glass is, I'm even interested in having toilet paper in the toilet. I expect everyone to do their work on time and on a regular basis. But I don't think that's an ego. This is business discipline.

Do you manage all the plays that the Exercise Scene puts on the stage?

Yooo! But there are some games that I especially want to manage. For example, after this game, ‘Fahrenheit 451 will put on stage, I want to manage it. It is a powerful work. We think a good job will come out.

Are you one of the actors who could surrender to the director while you were playing?

I'm an actor who can argue with the director. You're already doing that argument for the work that was produced. Not for your own ego. That discussion also reaches a conclusion in itself.
In any case that will prejudice my life concerns, my opposition will continue.

On the other hand, whatever you say, Erdal Beşikçioğludeyince comes to people's minds in an oppositional stance…

It's about being human. I have come to live in the world and any situation that would prejudice my vital concerns, of course, my opposition will always continue.
If I have come to life, if God has given me this life and likewise God says to me, ""Enjoy life!""
In this case, if I encounter actions and systems that I cannot enjoy, I will try not to see them again in my life. That's my problem!

So, because you live in Ankara, you don't give much material to the magazine?

Well, I don't go to places where journalists go when I go out at night to avoid strange questions from friends in the magazine. However, if they ask good questions, such an escape will not be necessary. It's already a part of our lives.

Maybe you don't need it because the mood you enter while playing a character feeds you.

A player never gets enough! Until he dies yani He is always hungry. It is the most important factor that drives the hunger to produce it. Yes, maybe I am enjoying it, I'm telling a wonderful, desirable story, but elsewhere when I come across something new that I say, “Look, this is a true story and worth telling, ım I start building it this time. So I think the artist can never get enough of it. When he reaches, he ceases to be an artist and becomes a merchant.
Let them see me when they wake up ...

Women love you. “Very handsome, charismatic, intellectual ... var There are compliments that go to infinity.

When those women got me out of bed in the morning, their ideas would probably change a lot.

Is it hard to feel that close?

So ... when it's a crescent, it's another, when it's a full moon. There are times when it is difficult, and when it is easy. I don't know. I don't know if that's an unbalanced expression, but ...
I'm also unhappy with Elvin.

You are married to Elvin Beşikçioğlu, who has been an actor like yourself for 28 years. Your Catholic wedding?

We grew up with Elvin. I met him in freshman year. We've been together ever since. We entered the conservatory in 1989, so think about it.

Does that alone explain the situation?

I think it explains. Our case is the same! My childhood friend, my youth friend, my life partner ...

After all these years, is there really love left?

I don't know! I don't really question him that much. I don't know how true it is to turn love into something conceptual.

Is there anyone in your life that you can say ım I am unhappy with you ”?

Elvin. Isn't that the answer to me being married?

Maybe you're very happy ...

Our lives weren't always rosy. One is a teacher, one is a civil servant. Five years after graduating from the conservatory, we went to Diyarbakır to join hands and play together and actually hold onto life.
Think of two children more than 20-21 years old ... Now that everything is not in the harbor of milk. But this is sharing life, sharing unhappiness.

Is ”unhappiness var a consensus or a choice?

Undoubtedly a very meaningful and profound choice. You can only be happy if you are unhappy with a person. How can the value of white be known without seeing black?
