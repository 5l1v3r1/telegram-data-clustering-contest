      <h1>England star Manu Tuilagi dwarfed as he stands next to fellow rugby-playing brothers</h1>
      <h2>Tuilagi comes from a famous rugby family and is the fourth of his brothers to be in a Rugby World Cup squad</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T07:14:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 07:14</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/</a></address>
      <p>England ace Manu Tuilagi is one of the most fearsome rugby players on the planet.</p>
      <p>At 18 stone in weight, he is easily one of the most powerful men playing the sport professionally and one of the key components of the England squad.</p>
      <p>However, when he stands next to his brothers, Tuilagi is left completely dwarfed.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the World Cup campaign, a picture went viral of the brothers, as Tuilagi stood in the middle of Henry, Freddie, Alesana and Vavae.</p>
      <p>All of the men on the picture, including Andy, another brother who was not included in the snap, are former rugby players in their own right.</p>

      <p>Tuilagi also has another two brothers who did not play rugby.</p>
      <p>Every single one of them has played for the Leicester Tigers as their family became something of a rugby dynasty at Welford Road.</p>
      <p>On this particular picture, it is Henry, stood on the far left, who caught the eyes of fans.</p>
      <p>The former Tigers and Perpignan No.8 looks about twice the size of the others - and had a fierce reputation of his own when he played.</p>
      <p>David Flatman, one of his previous opponents, tweeted last month: "We know Manu is a unit...so look at his big brother Henry.</p>
      <p>"Some of us had to (try to) tackle him. Never saw a unit like it.</p>

      <p>"Him leaving @LeicesterTigers and signing for Perpignan was a truly great day!"</p>
      <p>Chris Cusiter, who played with him at Perpignan, added: "There was a lot of ‘your man’ during training at Perpignan!"</p>
      <p>By playing this autumn, Manu is the fourth Tuilagi in the family to have been to the Rugby World Cup.</p>
      <p>Freddie was part of the Samoa squad in 2001, but did not play, before playing one game four years later.</p>

      <p>Alesana featured in Samoa's team for the 2007, 2011 and 2015 World Cups.</p>
      <p>Henry enjoyed two matches for Samoa in 2007.</p>
      <p>Andy also had the chance to play in the World Cup, but withdrew from Samoa's 2007 squad.</p>
      <p>Away from rugby, Tuliagi has two other brothers. The eldest, Olotuli, is a Fa’afafine, which translates to cross-dresser, and has lived his life as a woman, going by the name Julie.</p>
      <p>"It’s just the way he is," Tuilagi once said.</p>
      <p>"He was born like that and he wants to dress up as a woman. It doesn’t matter. He’s our brother.’"</p>
