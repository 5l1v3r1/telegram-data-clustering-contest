Delhi will restrict certain vehicles for 12 days from Monday, enforcing an odd-even scheme based on number plates to reduce hazardous air pollution.

First introduced in 2016, odd-even is a vehicle rationing method that aims at putting a curb on the number of cars on the roads. It allows cars with odd-numbered registration plates to run on odd dates, and those with even-numbered plates on even dates.The scheme would also be applicable to vehicles that are not registered in Delhi.
Reacting to the announcement, cab aggregators Ola and Uber said they would deactivate surge pricing for the entire 12 day-period. ""The Odd-Even scheme is a much needed step to reduce pollution. We whole heartedly support Delhi government's move and wish it success,"" a spokesperson from Uber said.
