      <p>Shortly after the UFC 244 ceremonial weigh-ins between Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz, Conor McGregor made a lighthearted jab at both men for displaying their bromance throughout fight week.</p>

      <p>“I’m sad they didn’t get to shake hands up there like they wanted to and tried to. It was so sad seeing this. Its like a love story up there. OMG Its the notebook. Now get out that fucking cheque book and donate to my charity and the real bad mans back,” McGregor posted on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Top-five UFC lightweight contender Justin Gaethje seems to have taken major offense to McGregor’s tweet, however, calling the Irishman ‘pathetic’ for expressing interest in a comeback fight against Donald Cerrone.</p>

      <p>“The real bad man that’s trying to fight a man coming off a loss. You’re f—ken pathetic. How long you think this sh-t is going to work for you?” Gaethje fired back.</p>
      <p>Gaethje, who knocked out Cerrone in brutal fashion at UFC Fight Night 158 this past September, has been calling for a fight with McGregor for the better part of the year. UFC president <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/10/31/20940990/dana-white-ufc-looking-at-conor-mcgregor-vs-donald-cerrone-for-january-ufc-246-mma-news">Dana White, however, says ‘The Notorious’ is more likely to return to the cage against ‘Cowboy’ </a>who, despite being one of the most exciting fighters in the promotion, is on a two-fight losing skid against two of the best contenders in the division.</p>
      <p>Gaethje, on the other hand, is on a seriously impressive three-fight KO streak and is considered just as, if not more, exciting than Cerrone.</p>
      <p>McGregor hasn’t fought since his submission loss to Khabib Nurmagomedov and is expected to return to the UFC in January.</p>
