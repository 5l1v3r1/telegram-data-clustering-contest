This is the horrific wreckage of a car which flipped after the driver lost control due to the wet weather on the M8.
Emergency services rushed to the scene of the smash at J3 eastbound near Livingston in West Lothian just after midnight on Saturday November 2.
Three people were taken to hospital as a precaution, but thankfully no-one was seriously injured.
Police Scotland issued a picture of the vehicle on Twitter showing its mangled back-end as the car lies on its roof.
 
They accompanied the snap with a warning for motorists to stay safe and check their speed on the roads when covered with surface water.
Road Policing Scotland posted: ""Please remember to drive to the prevailing weather conditions.
""If it's wet or there is surface water, slow down.
""Edinburgh RP attended a collision on the M8 last night after a driver lost control of their vehicle and came off the road. Thankfully no serious injuries!""
