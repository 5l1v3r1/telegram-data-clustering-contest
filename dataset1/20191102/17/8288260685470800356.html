      <h1>Birmingham City dealt major blow for next three matches against Fulham, Huddersfield and Sheffield Wednesday</h1>
      <h2>Blues captain Harlee Dean was sent off in injury time as Pep Clotet's side slipped to a 4-2 defeat to Cardiff City in the Championship</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T17:40:54+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 17:40</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Dick, https://www.facebook.com/blueswriterbriandick/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> will be without captain Harlee Dean for the next three matches following his dismissal in today’s 4-2 loss at Cardiff City.</p>
      <p>After dominating the opening period of the game Blues were trailing 3-2 in second half stoppage time when Dean was shown a straight red card for a challenge on Joe Ralls.</p>
      <p>The defender jumped up to win a header and seemed to catch the Cardiff midfielder, who would end up scoring a hat-trick, with his arm and was instantly dismissed by referee Andrew Madley.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>That will mean Dean is suspended for next week’s visit from Fulham as well as the trips to Huddersfield and Sheffield Wednesday - unless Blues can mount a successful appeal.</p>

      <p>It was the second red card of a feisty game, with Madley also sending off Danny Ward for a two-footed lunge on Kerim Mrabti at the start of the second period.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Chelsea  loan youngster <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jake-clarke-salter">Jake Clarke-Salter</a> is the obvious candidate to come in alongside Dean’s defensive partner Marc Roberts.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has made one Championship start since joining Blues in the summer.</p>
      <p>Madley did  not endear himself to Blues at all during the game in which he awarded Cardiff a penalty from a corner and also turned down their appeals for their own spot-kick late on.</p>
