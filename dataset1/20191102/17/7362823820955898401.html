      <h1>Twitter users blast JetBlue employee for 'sickening' homeless Halloween costume</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T17:01:07+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 17:01</time> by <a rel="author">Sara Dorn</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/airlines">JetBlue</a> worker who dressed as a homeless person “trying to get back to Puerto Rico or Cuba” is being excoriated on social media for what some are calling a “racist and highly offensive” depiction.</p>
      <p>The employee dressed down as a homeless person wearing tattered and soiled clothing, with a homemade cardboard sign around her neck that read “Homeless. Need help trying to get back home to Puerto Rico or Cuba,” an image of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/airlines">worker</a> posted to Twitter shows.</p>
      <p>“This was the costume of a JetBlue employee at the airport in Fort Lauderdale, FL,” Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/nats248/status/1190000344698359810">@nats2548 captioned a shot</a> of the worker standing in the JetBlue terminal in the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. “I want to read your opinions.”</p>

      <p>Criticism swelled quickly, with some calling for the worker to be fired.</p>
      <p>“@JetBlue needs to fire her a-- and issue a public apology for her costume because I find it highly offensive and … I personally won’t be flying JetBlue until they issue an apology… ” <a href="https://twitter.com/dominopr777/status/1190045093455155201">Twitter user @dominopr777 seethed.</a></p>

      <p>Others said the costume was tone-deaf to survivors of Hurricane Maria, the worst natural disaster in Puerto Rican history. The 2017 storm left over 3,000 people dead and thousands more homeless.</p>

      <p>The company apologized in a statement to the network and said “the situation was immediately addressed.”</p>
      <p>“In the spirit of Halloween, our crewmembers are welcome to celebrate in costume, but one crewmember chose a costume that was clearly insensitive and not in line with our costume policy,” said Derek Dombrowski, manager of corporate communications at JetBlue.</p>
