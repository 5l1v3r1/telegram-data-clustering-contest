Binotto says Ferrari ""need to take more risks""
02 Nov 2019, 17:25 by Adam Newton

Mattia Binotto says that Ferrari need to be more brave during races if they are to take victories more consistently, following Lewis Hamilton's gamble on a one-stop strategy in Mexico, a decision that paid off for Mercedes as Hamilton took the race win.

Ferrari seem to have the fastest car in F1 right now, but the last three race victories have gone to Mercedes, with Ferrari's strategy lacking at plenty of race weekends this season.



Ferrari boss Binotto says that the team have to be more bold when choosing strategies during races. He said to media in Austin: “Generally speaking we need to take more risks and be braver and being brave enough means that maybe when Albon stopped, we shouldn’t have stopped Charles, and he should have stayed out.

“But in doing that we were pretty sure that the tyres wouldn’t have lasted until the end by stopping at that time, which was wrong, the wrong assumption.”
