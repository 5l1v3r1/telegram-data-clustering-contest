Gretchen Carlson wants release from Fox News non-disclosure agreement
02 Nov 2019, 17:57 by Associated Press


NBC may tear up NDAs over alleged sexual misconduct


I confronted Harvey Weinstein. It wasn’t the first time


When Gretchen Carlson heard NBC News was considering letting people out of non-disclosure agreements involving alleged sexual misconduct at the network, she couldn’t help but think of the NDA she signed with Fox News three years ago.
“It would be nice to be able to be able to tell my full story,” Carlson said.
Carlson said she had asked to be let out of her NDA and talked to other Fox News employees who left with similar settlements about pressing the network.
“Companies are saying that they want to be open and transparent and that they have worked tirelessly to make their work environments safer,” she said. “And if that’s the truth, then they should let us out.”
Carlson got a reported $20m settlement in 2016 after she sued, claiming the late Fox News chief Roger Ailes demoted then fired her when she rejected his sexual advances. Besides her settlement, she got a public apology.
“That usually doesn’t happen when you come to some sort of an agreement,” she said. “Some would say that that would be an admission of guilt.”
Fox News did not return an email seeking comment.
Carlson’s case predated sexual misconduct allegations against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein by a year. One of the scandal’s revelations was how Weinstein used NDAs to silence women who accused him of abuse. His downfall led to the #MeToo movement that toppled scores of famous and powerful men.
Matt Lauer, a former anchor at the Today show, was fired by NBC News in 2017 for sexual misconduct. He denies any wrongdoing. The Pulitzer prize-winning reporter Ronan Farrow detailed more accusations against Lauer and accused the network of thwarting his investigations into Weinstein in his book Catch and Kill. That prompted MSNBC host Rachel Maddow to call on NBC to release people from their NDAs .
NBC said anyone interested in being released should reach out to the network and it would consider doing so. Carlson said that didn’t go far enough.
“It wasn’t completely clear whether or not these former victims can tell all,” Carlson said. “For example, they have to go back and ask permission. And does that mean that they can say some things, but they can’t say other things? So I think there needs to be a little bit more clarification on that.”
Since her departure from Fox, Carlson has become an advocate for women, from writing books like Be Fierce to producing and hosting the Lifetime documentary Breaking the Silence, about sexual harassment. She has also been advocating for legislation that would bar arbitration in sexual harassment cases.
Carlson’s allegations have been the basis of two Hollywood projects: Showtime’s The Loudest Voice, which aired earlier this year, and the forthcoming film Bombshell, with Nicole Kidman starring as Carlson. Carlson was not involved in either.
“Therein is the frustration and the strangeness of not being able to partake in really big projects that are about something so personal and painful in your life,” she said.
“But I have to look at it from the big picture, because the idea that these projects are even happening is really, really important because it continues the national dialogue about this issue. And if even one woman is helped from watching one of these projects and decides to have the courage to come forward, then these projects are a good idea.”
Carlson said she is amazed at how much progress has happened regarding sexual harassment cases in just three years.
“Women are now believed. Imagine that when they come forward, they’re not automatically maligned like I was. Perpetrators are being held accountable. There are consequences. There are almost immediate apologies.
“I mean, to think that that much has transformed in just a short period of time is really amazing.”
