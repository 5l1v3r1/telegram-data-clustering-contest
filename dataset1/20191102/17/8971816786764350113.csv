Mother denounces that Compensar did not tell her that her son would be born with Down syndrome
The family of the little one adds that the doctor who attended the pregnancy process knew about the condition of the child, but said nothing to not worry the mother.

02 Nov 2019, 17:48

Now, the family members of the child have tried to enroll him in the complementary health plan of the EPS, but Compensar has rejected it twice, according to the family, because of the child's condition.
Pulzo spoke with Michel Mesa, mother of the child and who told the story of the alleged medical negligence he lived during the time of pregnancy, and reported several additional irregularities by Compensar.
The woman said that, in July 2018, between the 11th and 13th week of pregnancy, when she was treated at an IPS in Chia, Cundinamarca, Dr. Marta Cecilia Díaz ordered an ultrasound called nuchal translucency, which serves to know if the child He has Down syndrome.
When the parents reviewed the results of the exams, they were struck that one of the indicators was underlined, but the doctor Diaz said absolutely nothing and the woman continued with her pregnancy, ""completely normal.""
The mother said that by personal decision she changed IPS and was transferred to Bogotá, to the headquarters of Compensar on 26th Street. When that happened, Mesa was already 32 weeks pregnant and her new doctor had to contextualize her process.
When reviewing the ultrasound, the doctor asked Mesa: “What did you say about this situation? What did you do?"". To the surprise of the woman, the doctor told him that the ultrasound showed a very high risk of the child being born with Down syndrome.
“That was in December. I was shocked; the truth, I didn't believe him. When he saw that I started to cry, he became super nervous, bit his nails and told me 'I don't know what to do, because, due to the advanced state of pregnancy, amniocentesis cannot be done to validate if the baby has syndrome of Down '”.
According to Mesa, the procedure could no longer be performed because a spontaneous abortion could be generated and they had to wait for the birth to know if the baby would have that condition.
After learning about her son's risk, the woman and her husband consulted other opinions, but found no better news. Even several doctors suggested that he not do ""baby shower"" because his son could die in the womb. ""They told me to be prepared for everything,"" he added.
Mesa told this media that after the child was born, effectively with Down syndrome, his mother met Dr. Marta Cecilia Díaz and claimed him for his omission.
“She (the doctor) told my mother that she had realized what that test said, but that she hadn't wanted to tell me anything so as not to worry. He also said that Compensar would have authorized amniocentesis and everything necessary to validate that information, ”he added.
Mesa said that the obligation to Compensate is to give truthful and complete information to the patient of his state of health, a situation that did not occur during his pregnancy.
Complaints of lies by the ESP and more irregularities
Once the baby was born, Michel Mesa requested his medical history from Compensar. However, the documents that were delivered registered her pregnancy from August, one month after the initial ultrasound, until January.
Mesa told officials that the story had to be since June and that his obligation was to deliver the complete information.
When the medical record was handed to her, she came up with a huge surprise as the document claimed that she had been informed of judgment C355 (on voluntary termination of pregnancy).
According to Mesa, the document says explicitly: ""The user decides to continue the pregnancy.""


Judgment provided by Michel Natalia Mesa

The mother told Pulzo that this statement is completely false:
“They never told me about any sentence. If my pregnancy was supposed to come normal (as Marta Cecilia Díaz said at the time) and was desired, why would they name me a sentence that speaks of abortion? Why in the medical record does it say that the user decides to continue the pregnancy? ”
Mesa made it clear that, had he known the risk in which his son was, he would not have thought of an abortion, but he could have avoided having depression, or having to go to a psychologist, as he would have had time to assimilate the news.
The mother presumes that Compensar put that data in the medical record to heal in health for the omission they committed.
According to Mesa's testimony, from the health promoting entity they have not contacted her, at least, to offer her an apology or to tell her that corrective measures will be taken with the doctor who omitted information about her son.
The woman said her family is not interested in suing Compensar or filling out the EPS for guardianships. All they want is for them to receive the child in the complementary health plan, in compensation for what they (did) not do.
“Compensar boasts its competencies in inclusion policies, but this inclusion has nothing. Why are they going to deny a complementary plan to a boy with Down syndrome, if he didn't decide to be born like this? What we want is for my son to have a better quality of life in terms of his health. ”
Mesa stressed that his baby's is not the only case and that many families find out that their child has Down syndrome only until he is born, and that when they request a complementary plan or a prepaid medical affiliation they are not allowed. He added that ""many children are being discriminated against because of their condition.""
Pulzo contacted Compensar, but the entity said the issue is being reviewed internally to give an official response.
Legal version
This media consulted a legal source that stressed that the parents of the child could sue the EPS because, if they had been given the correct information, they could even have exercised the right to the choice of abortion (this does not mean that at some point they would have considered).
According to the legal source, ""it is not that the child is a detriment, but the expenses that can be generated to the family can be compensable.""
Even, the source added, a conciliation could be cited in which the EPS can be required to compensate all medical expenses arising from Down syndrome for omitting information that would have allowed them to have knowledge of the situation.
""The issue is that the family had a loss of opportunity or loss of chance and that is compensable in Colombia,"" the source concluded.
