Crisis 2020 ('celebrity' edition)
Princes who do not know where they get so much money and princesses intervened mark the news

02 Nov 2019, 05:45

If you write the word crisis in Google, the first result that - this machine of hell that knows better than your mother - proposes to you is Crisis 2020. An unequivocal example that people are not very calm about the immediate Become our economy as well as about the fact that the multitude of elections in which we go religiously to vote serve to choose competent politicians to save us a new -new-economic downturn. Perhaps because of this collective panic that people do not speak in the elevator but who investigates through Google when they arrive at the office, it is that I have the celebrities somewhat altered by issues of these days.
The first ones indicated for having a peculiar relationship with money are two of the only children of the queen, for which I would allow myself to reign voluntarily, Elisabet II. The English politician Norman Baker, who has evolved from a liberal deputy to a writer, has given us an exquisitely offending title book that says ... and what do you do? - And what you are doing, in Catalan, in which he talks about the jobs of the children of the Queen of Britain and about the relationship of the Windsor family in general with money.
The first maculat by the text of Baker is Prince Carles (02), that someday he will have to put the layer of ermine and crown to try to play some important role in history. After criticizing that the Windsor has fifteen public palaces at their disposal - aside from their private ones, where the administration also puts money ... -, the writer speaks of the eternal heir as a frivolous one with respect to taxpayer money
Specifically, he points out that when he went from an official visit to Canada a couple of years ago, they made several stops and, in one of them, he saw himself angry because his portable butler had forgotten his favorite lighter at the immediately preceding destination. Baker explains that, in order to compensate him for such an offense, he chartered a private jet that was going to pick up the shoemaker. 1,600 kilometers of kerosene. But what is this if it pays to distribute? Nothing! By the way, do you remember that this man usually makes proclamations against climate change, right? Perfect, then
His brother Andreu de York (01), he seems more concerned about the money that he, I guess because it is clear that when his mother disappears, the bargain will be enough. For this reason, he suggests Baker, the third child of the queen has been making drawers from her position as a Special Representative for Trade and Investment in the United Kingdom. The author points out that Andreu has gone, between 2008 and 2011, nine times in the UAE, five in Qatar, and four in Kuwait, Bahrain and Egypt. A series of trips that should have had a positive impact on British companies, if they had not been taken away, right?
Baker says that when he asked the minister of the branch for what figure he had managed to move the prince in these trips, the answer was: ""It is not possible to directly attribute the obtaining of specific contracts to the specific intervention of an individual "". Go! What a pity. Your great task can not be counted ... What you can recompense, see where your goods are: 15 million euros for a villa in the Alps and 8.6 for a reform - reform! - from the place where live in london Knowing that the public bureau only collects 290,000 gross per year, there is no need to say anything else, say Baker.
Who also carries economic itching is the wife of the last princess of Hawaii. Currently, Veronica Gail Worth, 66, is in the middle of the war to prove that his wife, the Abigail Kinoiki Kekaulike Kawānanakoa (05) aristocrat of 93, is in full power to govern his enormous heritage, of approximately 200 millions of euros. After taking an infarct, the girlfriend of the entire life of the old woman convinced her to take off her administrator, to marry immediately and, finally, to put her to her as the administrator of everything. That ended badly and a judge decided that his funds would be controlled by First Hawaiian Bank and not his wife. This week, the ill-fated princess has once again put her bones in front of a judge to convince her that she can be worthwhile and let her manage her enormous heritage.
The U.S., who have no monarchy beyond the Kennedy, are pending resolution, especially to see how the princess's wife goes out well-or stop. At the moment, with the trial, the blues that the poor lady has had since the care of her wife have been made public. Fucking money man!
And another who might have wanted to say money when he said justice and dignity is Javier Santos (04), the last son - by order of legal arrival - of Julio Iglesias (03). Valencia, 43, had always said that his life struggle to get his father's last name was a matter of honor, but now, since he has already had it, he wants something else. According to Jaleos published this week, he and his lawyer are already evaluating sales offers about the inheritance rights of Santos with respect to the legacy of the interpreter of Hey, who is already 75 years old.
You will not tell me that the thing does not look pretty bad for next year. The celebrities who know everything before the rest have long encountered Crisis 2020 on Google. That's why everyone works to escape the cream. They should not be concerned that no politician saves them anything. Normal
