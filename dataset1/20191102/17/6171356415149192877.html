      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T17:59:42+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 17:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/contest-coordinator/" target="_blank">Contest Coordinator</a></address>
      <p>Have you been looking for a wall adapter that can charge all your devices? Xcentz just released its new 36W USB-PD charger, and we're giving away 26 of them! We also have an exclusive coupon code, if you want to buy one right now.</p>
      <p>This new super-compact wall charger has two USB ports â€” one 18W USB Type-C port for devices that support USB-PD, and a regular USB Type-A connector with Qualcomm QuickCharge 3.0. Both ports can operate at full power at the same time, giving you a combined 36W of power.</p>
      <p>The inclusion of both USB Power Delivery and Qualcomm QuickCharge support covers both major quick charging standards, so you can quickly top up just about any phone or tablet you might own. Some of the compatible devices include Galaxy S/Note phones, Google Pixels, several iPhone models, the iPad Air, and the Nintendo Switch.</p>
