Conor McGregor claims to be real ‘BMF’, Justin Gaethje calls him ‘pathetic’
02 Nov 2019, 17:30 by Lewis Mckeever



Shortly after the UFC 244 ceremonial weigh-ins between Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz, Conor McGregor made a lighthearted jab at both men for displaying their bromance throughout fight week.



“I’m sad they didn’t get to shake hands up there like they wanted to and tried to. It was so sad seeing this. Its like a love story up there. OMG Its the notebook. Now get out that fucking cheque book and donate to my charity and the real bad mans back,” McGregor posted on Twitter.

Top-five UFC lightweight contender Justin Gaethje seems to have taken major offense to McGregor’s tweet, however, calling the Irishman ‘pathetic’ for expressing interest in a comeback fight against Donald Cerrone.



“The real bad man that’s trying to fight a man coming off a loss. You’re f—ken pathetic. How long you think this sh-t is going to work for you?” Gaethje fired back.
Gaethje, who knocked out Cerrone in brutal fashion at UFC Fight Night 158 this past September, has been calling for a fight with McGregor for the better part of the year. UFC president Dana White, however, says ‘The Notorious’ is more likely to return to the cage against ‘Cowboy’ who, despite being one of the most exciting fighters in the promotion, is on a two-fight losing skid against two of the best contenders in the division.
Gaethje, on the other hand, is on a seriously impressive three-fight KO streak and is considered just as, if not more, exciting than Cerrone.
McGregor hasn’t fought since his submission loss to Khabib Nurmagomedov and is expected to return to the UFC in January.
