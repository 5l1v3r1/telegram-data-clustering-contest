College student's murder in New York leads to a guilty verdict in Nicaragua
02 Nov 2019, 17:35 by Robert Gearty
A female college student’s accused killer has been convicted in Nicaragua after authorities there refused to extradite him to New York.
Orlando Tercero, 23, fled to Nicaragua after 22-year-old Haley Anderson was found dead in his bed near Binghamton University in New York last year.
He was found guilty of murder Friday by a judge in Managua in the rare legal proceeding involving the two countries. He faces a maximum of 30 years in prison when he is sentenced at a later date.
“Today, justice was served as much as it can be,” Broome County District Attorney Steve Cornwell said, according to WBNG-TV.

Nicaragua rejected the extradition request because Tercero is a dual U.S.-Nicaraguan citizen. The Central American country prohibits the extradition of its own citizens.
The Nicaraguan judge watched witnesses testified from Binghamton via a video hook-up.
Prosecutors said Tercero left behind a note saying he was sorry.

Friends of Anderson said Tercero was obsessed with her, according to reports. They were students at Binghamton and had an on-again, off-again relationship.
Anderson’s father spoke to reporters after the verdict, WBNG reported.
“I don’t know if there’s ever a word for justice because there’s no justice for something as truly, for lack of words, disheartening as this was,” Gordon Anderson said, according to the station.
