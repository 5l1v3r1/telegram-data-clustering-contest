      <p>Fans were quick to spread the word about a special display for King Khan that would be projected on the structure. Going by the videos and first hand reactions by fans and spectators at the venue, it was certainly something that will be remembered for a long time.</p>
      <p>Back on home soil, Shah Rukh has started off his day by meeting and greeting the many gathered outside his home late last night. Fans were in for a double treat when he made his second appearance later this evening with son, AbRam Khan in tow.</p>
      <p>Shah Rukh also attended a special event with an auditorium full of fans, where he cut his birthday cake, danced, interacted and even delivered some of his popular dialogues.</p>
