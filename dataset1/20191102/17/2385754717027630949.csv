""Solution"" with Erdogan the authoritarian ... godfather
02 Nov 2019, 17:27 by * Kostas Mavridis
The other day, at the recent International Energy Conference, which was held in Nicosia on my own initiative as Chairman of the Political Committee for the Mediterranean, co-organized by the International Organization of Petroleum and Gas Producers, the Minister of Energy of the Republic of Cyprus. important. Referring to Turkey's illegal actions in the Cyprus EEZ, he said the following, while displaying a relevant map: ""Turkey considers that Cyprus has an Exclusive Economic Zone and a continental shelf, but it has no west. This means that, according to the Turkish version, Cyprus remains with 31% of the total Exclusive Economic Zone. "" Beyond the percentages based on the Turkish version and beyond the discovered deposits, Venus and Calypso will not belong to Cyprus, the crucial point is the solution to the Cyprus problem: Turkey believes the only acceptable sharing will be based on the Turkish version , which includes almost everything already regulated under international law. Either without a solution or after the solution to the Cyprus problem, Turkey seeks a dominant role after it has made clear that its ""sovereign rights"" include the majority of the Cypriot seas! If a solution to the Cyprus problem were found tomorrow, Turkey would claim ""sovereign rights"", which, based on its version of the Turkish shelf, limit Cyprus to 31%. If tomorrow we come to a solution that will ensure the continuation of the Cypriot state (as a development of the Republic of Cyprus), Turkey will continue to claim a dominant role in the Cypriot seas! Therefore, those who insist that with the solution of the Cyprus problem, we will proceed unhindered to exploit our energy wealth are ignorant. Understanding various illusions as supposedly naive realism is understandable. But it is inconceivable that any solution would bring prosperity to a normal state within the EU, while the day after that would have Turkish domination. Cyprus' energy plans are one-way and we must move on. The companies participating in the International Conference are ""investing"" in the Republic of Cyprus, whose empowerment in every way, including defense, is vital rationalization. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness strategy in Turkey is the only proposal, since there is nothing but the requirement to accept the Turkish terms under Erdogan's ""godfather"" rule. However, the repetition that the passage of time works against us (which actually works by impeding the occupation) as if we are responsible for not finding a solution is criminal! * Kostas Mavridis - DIKO MEP (S&D)
