In a first, the world famous Burj Khalifa lit up with a special message for Shah Rukh Khan on his 54th birthday.
“Happy birthday to the King of Bollywood Shah Rukh Khan” were the words that lit up the iconic tower in Dubai.



Fans for the star were in for a spectacle of a dancing fountain display in sync to the beats of Bollywood music. This was reportedly the first-ever time that something like this was ever done, for any actor in the world.
We must say, it is a celebration fit for a King.















Fans were quick to spread the word about a special display for King Khan that would be projected on the structure. Going by the videos and first hand reactions by fans and spectators at the venue, it was certainly something that will be remembered for a long time.
Back on home soil, Shah Rukh has started off his day by meeting and greeting the many gathered outside his home late last night. Fans were in for a double treat when he made his second appearance later this evening with son, AbRam Khan in tow.
Shah Rukh also attended a special event with an auditorium full of fans, where he cut his birthday cake, danced, interacted and even delivered some of his popular dialogues.
