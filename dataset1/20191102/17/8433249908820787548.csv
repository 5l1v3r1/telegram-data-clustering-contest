تستضيف العاصمة البريطانية لندن معرضاً لتحف نادرة من مقبرة الملك الفرعوني توت عنخ آمون بين 2 نوفمبر – تشرين الثاني والثالث من مايو – أيار 2020.
وفتح المعرض أبوابه اليوم السبت تحت اسم ""توت عنخ آمون، كنوز الفرعون الذهبي"" ويتضمن 150 قطعة أثرية تُعرض ضمن فعاليات الاحتفال بمرور 100 عام على اكتشاف المقبرة بواسطة عالم الآثار البريطاني هاوارد كارتر.
ومن أشهر التحف المعروضة كأس على شكل زهرة لوتس محفور عليه تمنيات لحياة مديدة للملك الشاب تصل إلى ألف عام.
وحكم توت عنخ آمون مصر منذ أن كان في التاسعة من عمره وحتى وفاته بعمر 18 أو 19 عاماً.
وقبل أن تصل إلى لندن، عُرضت التحف في العاصمة الفرنسية باريس فجلبت 1.4 مليون زائر.
وستكون العاصمة البريطانية المحطة الأخيرة في رحلة تحف الملك توت قبل أن تعود لتعرض بالمتحف المصري الكبير المقرر اقتتاحه في نهاية العام المقبل.
