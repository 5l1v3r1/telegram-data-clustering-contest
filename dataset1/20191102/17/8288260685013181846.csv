'Mentality' - Liverpool fans are all saying the same thing after Aston Villa comeback
Aston Villa 1-2 Liverpool reaction | Andy Robertson and Sadio Mane capped a late turnaround for Jurgen Klopp's side at Villa Park after they trailed at half-time

Liverpool fans are in dreamland after their late turnaround at Villa Park.
They have beaten Aston Villa 2-1 despite being 1-0 down until the final three minutes.
Andy Robertson cancelled out Trezeguet's 21st minute opener before Sadio Mane put Jurgen Klopp's European champions ahead in the fourth minute of added time.
That puts Liverpool six points clear of Manchester City at the top of the League , Pep Guardiola's side themselves coming from 1-0 down to beat struggling Southampton at the Etihad Stadium.
 
And, as expected, Reds fans were full of joy at full-time and took to social media to express their thoughts on events at Villa Park on Saturday afternoon.
Here's the pick of the reaction on social media after a fraught ending to the match...

@ SixTimesLFC : MENTALITY GIANTS, YOU CANNOT WRITE US OFF
@ SwordsRita : Never doubted it for a minute
