      <p><b>RIO DE JANEIROÂ (AP)</b> - Brazil says small amounts of oil from a spill along the northeast coast have reached a national marine park.</p>
      <p>Naval and environmental officials said Saturday that oil traces were removed from Santa Barbara Island in the Abrolhos park in the state of Bahia.</p>
      <p>Santa Barbara is among five islands in the Abrolhos park, which contains one of Brazil's largest coral reefs. There were no reports that oil had reached the reef.</p>
      <p>Oil has washed ashore on some 2,100 kilometers (1,300 miles) of Brazil's coastline for two months, hurting tourism and fishing.</p>
      <p>Brazil says the oil is Venezuelan and came from a Greek-flagged ship belonging to Delta Tankers Ltd.</p>
      <p>The company denies the allegation, saying it has found no evidence of leakage on the vessel.</p>
