      <p>Now that it’s finally been released, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483160/the-irishman-reviews-are-up-see-what-critics-are-saying">the excitement surrounding Martin Scorsese’s new film</a>, <i>The Irishman</i>, is at an all time high. But only a lucky few will be able to see it on the big screen. And according to prominent theater owners, it’s not only a disgrace -- it’s all Netflix’s fault.</p>
      <p>According to John Fithian, the President of the National Association of Theater Owners, negotiations with the streaming platform dissolved when the two sides couldn’t agree on a timeframe that the film could be shown exclusively in theaters. <i>The Irishman</i> will be available for <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483518/netflix-responds-to-backlash-over-new-playback-speed-feature">streaming on Netflix</a> beginning on November 27. Before then, just eight theaters in New York City and Los Angeles will be screening the film. John Fithian told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/business/irishman-netflix-theaters.html">The New York Times</a> he blames Netflix for the film’s limited availability to fans, explaining:</p>
      <blockquote>It’s a disgrace. It’s a very big disappointment that Netflix and the leading theater owners couldn’t figure out a way to put a significant movie from Martin Scorsese on a lot of screens. This is a major director, a cinephile, who has made all kinds of important movies for our industry. And <i>The Irishman</i> is going to play on one-tenth of the screens it should have played on, had Netflix been willing to come to an understanding with our members.</blockquote>
      <p>There’s been a lot of debate about where Netflix fits into the movie industry. Directors like Martin Scorsese and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2464636/alfonso-cuaron-defends-netflixs-roma-says-its-unfair-to-compare-to-a-theatrical-release">Alfonso Cuaron</a> have embraced the platform as a legitimate distributor, while naysayers like <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1684110/why-christopher-nolan-will-never-work-with-netflix">Christopher Nolan</a> and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Why-Quentin-Tarantino-Doesn-t-Like-Netflix-85287.html">Quentin Tarantino</a> believe there’s a dividing line between films that receive cinematic releases and those that don’t. Even <i>The Irishman</i>’s stars, Al Pacino and Ray Romano, are proponents of seeing films on the big screen. John Fithian also spoke with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/netflix-missed-a-strategic-opportunity-irishman-release-theater-chief-says-1251740">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, and argued that Netflix messed up a chance to expand its horizons, stating:</p>
      <blockquote>Netflix is facing a challenge to their business model for the first time and missed a strategic opportunity. They are competing now for subscribers and filmmakers with companies with deep pockets, deep libraries and multiple ways to reach consumers. They sent a signal to filmmakers that even if you’re Martin Scorsese, you won’t get the wide theatrical release you want through Netflix.</blockquote>
      <p>Martin Scorsese <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482303/martin-scorsese-reveals-why-he-took-the-irishman-to-netflix-streaming">defended his decision to bring <i>The Irishman</i> to Netflix</a> after Paramount passed on it, stating that he would take the opportunity to make the $159 million film without creative interference, even if it meant it wouldn’t see a wide release. And though Netflix is facing backlash for how it’s chosen to distribute <i>The Irishman</i>, the film itself is <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483160/the-irishman-reviews-are-up-see-what-critics-are-saying">earning spectacular reviews from critics</a>. And that’s another win for a platform that’s trying to solidify itself as a home for great movies -- big screen or no big screen.</p>
