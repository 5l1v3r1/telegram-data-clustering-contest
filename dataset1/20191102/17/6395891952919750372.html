      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - Boston Police are investigating a fatal shooting that occurred blocks away from a recent double shooting that left one person dead.</p>
      <p>Police say they were called Friday night to a report of person shot near 35 Paine Street, in the Roslindale neighborhood of Boston. Officers found an adult male suffering from what appeared to be a gunshot wound. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>The incident comes a day after police responded Thursday to a double shooting in the same neighborhood.</p>
      <p>Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins has acknowledged an uptick in activity in Roslindale and her office is working with the Boston Police on both cases.</p>
      <p>Police have not said whether the two shootings are connected. They're asking for the public's help in solving the crimes.</p>
