“This is restaurant singing, you need to listen to it after drinking”
The representative of Belarus at the Eurovision Song Contest did not go to the Russian ""Voice"".

02 Nov 2019, 17:26

Ruslan Alekhno, representing Belarus at the Eurovision-2008 international song contest, failed during a “blind” listening to the popular show “Voice”, naviny.by reports.



The singer performed a song by Yaak Yoala ""I will pick up music."" However, none of the jury turned to the artist and thereby left him behind the show.
According to Polina Gagarina, who is familiar with Alekhno, her choice (or rather, “non-selection”) was influenced by fatigue: “This is terrible. I missed"".
Sergei Shnurov joked that during the song he was distracted by Konstantin Meladze, who danced because “Konstantin rarely dances.”
Valery Syutkin did not like the excessive academic skills in the performance of the Belarusian, and the aforementioned Meladze said that Alekhno’s singing is like a “restaurant”, which you should listen to after drinking.
The frontman of the Leningrad group retorted: “Believe me, if I had felt the restaurant, I would have turned. The restaurant was not enough, to be honest. The artist is good! ”



When Ruslan appeared behind the scenes, he told the presenter Dmitry Nagiyev that he was leaving the studio with a sense of accomplishment and ""would not regret at 60 that he had not gone on to the project.""
