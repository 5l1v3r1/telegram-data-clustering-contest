      <p>The peri peri chicken chain took to Facebook to ask customers to help share their initiative online so that it spreads to people down on their luck who may be alone on the 25th.</p>
      <p>They also asked users to chip in with anything they could, including scarfs, gloves, jackets, toiletries and sleeping bags, <a href="https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/glasgow-news/homeless-glasgow-christmas-day-nandos-17189315">according to Glasgow Live</a> .</p>
      <p>Writing online, they said: "We are planning on opening on Christmas Day to feed some of Glasgow’s many homeless.</p>
      <p>"We’d love to be able to give them some gifts to help them keep warm and clean and we need your help!</p>
      <p>"We have placed a bin at our entrance and would love if you could help us fill it with hats, gloves, blankets, toiletries, jackets, sleeping bags etc.</p>
