Sam Cosgrove should be fit to play for Aberdeen against Ross County next week despite limping off in the win over Kilmarnock.
The big striker scored in the 3-0 win but was forced off in the second half with a groin injury.
But Derek McInnes is confident he'll be fit to play next weekend as he looks to continue their fine form.
Since being battered by Celtic, the Dons have won two in a row and will hope to add a third in Dingwall.
Craig Bryson also missed out through injury but McInnes expects him to make a quick recovery and return to action.

He told BBC Scotland: ""Little tightness in his groin. I was going to take one of the strikers off anyway I was just debating which one.
""I felt we needed to get an extra midfielder in there, especially when Dicker moved into midfield, to get a bit of control. He’ll be okay for next week as will Bryson hopefully.
""Ash Taylor was in the squad today so we’re getting to get bodies back but I’m pleased with the players, their effort has been great and they’ve been very good over the last couple of games.""
